# Special Fee Endorsements
## 
### 
In mi effort to mike informed special-fee
empmements, members vj The Daily's editorial
hbdrd spent numerous hours during the frfist two
weeks revieumg the budgets and ASSU Elections
Handbook statements submitted by student groups
requesting sperm I fees to the ASSU. The members
<>l the editorial board also met with representatives
of each oj the groups and asked them about the
group's goals, its accomplishments during the past
year, plans for expansion or improvement in the
towing academic year and how special-fee funds
would be spent.
liased on the submitted information and
intervieji' discussions, the board reached an
endorsement decision for each group based on a
majority vote within the board. The board has
tried to include as much information about each
group as possible in the explanation of its
endorsements. The Daily encourages all students
to obtain a co/ry of the ASSI! Elections Handbook
and read each group's statement and budget to
reach then own concliisums.
AS NOTED IN the evaluation criteria
editorial published on March 28,
I ht> Daily has rated each student
group on a 1 to 5 scale that assesses the
group's effectiveness and its value.
In evaluating the groups, the editorial
hoard closely examined the achievements
of the fee groups during the past year and
the viability of the group's plans for the
upcoming year.
Student groups that are requesting a
spec ial lee for the first time were evaluated
on their expected effectiveness and value as
st't forth in their proposals and presenta
tions, as well as the viability of their plans
for the coming year.
Below is an explanation of the 1 to 5 rat
ing scale that was used as a composite score
for a group's effectiveness and value.

ASH is a strong program that provides over
150 students with I lie opportunity to explore
social issues, service learning and communi
ty action through various programs operat

putting its funds to efficient and effective
use.
4 — Group has successfully fulfilled
almost all goals set during the previous year

an effort to fulfill unmet goals and achieve
improvement. Group's activities are a value
to the Stanford community.
2 — (iroup has met few of the previous
year's goals. Plan for the upcoming year
does not clearly reflect effort to fulfill
unmet goals or does not seem viable.
Group's sense of its constituency is hazy
and its ability to effectively and efficiently
use funds is unclear, even though the
group's activities could be of value to stu
dents.
1 — (iroup has met no goals and has not
proven its value to the student population.
Group's ability to use funds effectively and
efficiently is questionable.
The individual fee group summaries

ing during spring break. ASH definitively
serves a need I hat would otherwise go unmet
and would be missed should it not exist on
campus. The program needs its special fees
to continue operating and has made exten
sive efforts this past year to fundraise outside
of special fees. Since the program must limit
itself to a certain number of trips and stu
dents, ASH could increase its programming
in the spring quarter, such as holding
forums or dorm talks, so that participants
and leaders can share their service experi
ences with other students.

Asian American $28,569
Students (UO $ 1.48)
Association
12 3 4 5
AASA is an umbrella organization that pro
vides resources and support for 10 Asian-
American student groups. Its three-pronged
focus, on social, cultural and political issues, is
a well-executed one, making it a group that
would definitely be missed if it didn't exist.
AASA also makes an admirable effort to
fundraise and bring in money for its groups
outside of the monies it receives from special
fees, and it could focus on this more for the
upcoming year. AASA's programming is slay
ing balanced next year and will not increase to
any great extent, in conjunction with only a
I.() percent increase in special fee requests
from last year.
ASSU $89,770
Legal Counseling (B $2.18)
12 3 4 5
The ASSU Legal Counseling Office has pro
vided free legal advice to Stanford students
for many years. Although the LCO cannot
represent students in court, their staff attor
neys focus on "preventative law" and will
answer questions about parking tickets,
bankruptcy, and divorce, among other
issues. This past year, the LCO advised
about 700 graduate students and 400 under
graduates. Although their special fee request
is large, the service they provide is a huge
asset to the student body. However, it is
important that the LCO increase its publici
ty efforts dramatically since many students
are completely unaware that this invaluable
service even exists.
ASSU $121,901
Speakers Bureau (B $2.93)
12 3 4 5
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a student-run
organization that brings well-known speak
ers to campus, organizes debates and panel
discussions on current events and co-spon
sors other student groups' speaking events
and discussions. The group increased their
budget by 3.1 percent in order to increase
the amount of money they have available to
advertise their events and to have more
money available to attract world-renowned
speakers to campus. Fart of the ASSU Speak
ers Bureau special fee is used to pay the
salaries of its two officers. Providing free lec

tures by famous figures and assisting other
groups in doing the same makes the ASSU
Speakers Bureau a valuable organization on
campus whose presence would be missed.
Barrio $21,299.84
Assistance (UO $1.11)
12 3 4 5
This group has tutored school-age children
for 28 years, and they have a lot to show for
it, having used that time to build a presti
gious and effective program for area youth
who would have no exposure to a university
like Stanford otherwise. Their budget is
meticulously and efficiently organized and
they work very hard to establish outside
funding. They provide a strong link between
children in East Palo Alto and Stanford stu
dents. Barrio Assistance, in providing a stim
ulating experience of Stanford for young
children who return year after year, is truly
an invaluable asset to the community.
Black $27,270
Student Union (UO $1.41)
12 3 4 5
l he Black Student Union, a vital part of the
African-American community at Stanford, has
demonstrated a clear sense of purpose and
constituency as well as a broad range of pro
gramming designed to benefit not only the
Stanford community, but also, local areas.
Special fees provide funding for events such as
the Kwanzaa celebration, a welcome reception
for black freshmen during orientation, the
Soul Food Dinner and the BSU's high school
conference which is an important outreach
into Bay Area communities. In addition, the
BSU cosponsors many events with other cam
pus organizations such as the Kevin Powell
lecture this year, and the group plans to lix us
on attracting a prominent speaker to campus
in the coming year.
Club Sports $154,440
(B $3.75)
12 3 4 5
The Club Sports special fee provides fund
ing for the 18 Club Sports teams ranging
from squash to mountain hiking. These
teams receive little funding from the Athlet
ic Department, and the special fee is used to
cover the costs of equipment, travel and
other expenses. Stanford's Club Sports
teams enjoy unparalleled success around the

country with teams such as women's rugby
and women's ultimate Frisbee capturing
national titles last year. The special lee is cru
cial to the continuation oi" the hugely suc
cessful Club Sports program.
International $9,791.30
Undergraduate (UO $0.51)
Community
12 3 4 5
As the only on-campus group serving Stan
lord's population of international students
through events such as International Stu
dent Orientation, dinners, workshops and
cultural activities, lUC 112 ulfills a vital function
that would otherwise go unmet. However,
despite this apparent focus on international
students, the organization is open to every
one and attempts to reach out to students
from all backgrounds in its programming.
Moreover, this year's special fee request rep
resents only a small request increase from
last year's fee.
Kids with $9,134.39
Dreams (UO $0.47)
12 3 4 5
Kids with Dreams is a community service
organization whose primary goal in previous
years has been outreach to developmentally
handicapped children in the Bay Area. In the
last year, this organization has been successful
in also hosting a large, extremely successful,
and very well-organized conference introduc
ing the idea of "social entrepreneurship,"
demonstrating the group's commitment to the
campus community at large. Along with a
decrease in this year's special fee request, their
budgets reflect an efficient use of funding, and
they have been diligent in seeking alternate
sources of funding.
KZSU $84,944
(UO $2.06)
12 3 4 5
As a student-run radio station featuring sev
eral types of programming, including news,
sporting events, and music, KZSU provides
a valuable service to the campus. However,
the station could be more active in its overall
publicity efforts to make others more aware
of its presence. Furthermore, the organiza
tion has run into some problems with debt in
recent years that it must attempt to rectify
immediately.

MEChA $34,911
(UO $1.81)
12 3 4 5
MEChA is a well-organized, strong group that
provides programming focused on addressing
the needs of Chicano/a and Latino/a students
on campus, as well as bringing the culture to
the greater Stanford community. MEChA
does very well in fundraising and is active in
the community, providing students with the
chance to be involved in activism surrounding
issues ranging from Webb Ranch to the
grapes boycott. The group holds a variety of
different programs dining the year, from
Caesar Chavez Commemoration Week to Dia
de los Muertos, and it serves an important role
in the community.
Mind's Eye $13,146
(UO $0.68)
12 3 4 5
1 he Mind's Eye publishes two issues a year of
student photography, poetry, short stories,
and painting. As the only literary magazine on
campus, the Mind's Eye serves an important
need that would otherwise go unmet. While
these students strive to produce a high-quality
journal of expression, a much larger effort at
publicity is necessary for this group to serve
the larger campus most effectively.
NAACP $15,395
(UO $0.80)
12 3 4 5
Requesting a special fee for the second year, the
Stanford chapter of the NAACP has done a
good job of re-organizing its budget to address
problems noted in its first year of using special
fees with only a modest increase in its special lee
request. The group has a strong sense of its
constituency, serving it in many ways, including
through the co-sponsorship of events with
other organizations. In addition, given the role
of the NAACP across the nation, it is important
for Stanford to have its own chapter of this
prestigious organization.
Project $6,153
Motivation (UO $0.32)
12 3 4 5
Project Motivation works to expose at-risk
youth to the benefits of college by bringing
them to Stanford in an effort to put them on
the track to success. The group organizes
events like "A Day with an Undergrad," pro
vides information packets on applying to col
lege, and has even seen its own graduates go
on to attend Stanford. This 20-year-old pro
grain decreased its special lee request by 1 I
percent this year, spending their its efficiently
in addition to serving an important purpose
in a creative and committed way.
SCBN $19,195
(B $0.47)
12 3 4 5
The most impressive thing about this group is
the fact that they have managed to reduce this
year's special fee request by 14 percent. How
ever, the rest of their goals for next year seem
a bit hazy and unrealistic. The group is defi
nitely a plus for students as it provides the
campus with free cable, but the actual number
of people who choose to use this service is
unclear.
Stanford $30,251
American Indian (UO $1.57)
Organization
12 3 4 5
SAIO serves as the social, political and cultur
al center for the American Indian, Alaska
Native and Native Hawaiian communities at
Stanford. The group is responsible for the

Stanford Powwow, as well as a number of
other campus cultural events to reflect the
diverse traditions of Native American culture.
The group has demonstrated a clear sense of
its own constituency, but SAIO events do
reach the entire campus, not just the Ameri
can Indian population. SAIO is the primary
organization responsible for the Native Amer
ican community and is a valuable asset to a
culturally diverse Stanford campus.
Stanford Axe $ 10,185
Committee (UO $0.53)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Axe Committee was founded
to maintain the traditions of the University
and its Athletics Department. Its responsibil
ities include annual Big Came week activi
ties, the protection of the Axe when it is on
campus and the distribution of a handbook
for freshmen containing the history and tra
ditions of Stanford. The group has minimal
sources of funding and relies almost entirely
on its special fee to continue its operation.
Axe Coimn currently serves an important
112 unction but could make more of an effort to
be active outside of the football season.
Besides occasional attendance at some spoi l
ing events and the sponsoring of the I'risbee
golf tournament in the spring, the group is
not visible on campus after fall quarter. Axe
Comm needs to address the above issues
before it can become a wise investment for
the Stanford Community.
Stanford Band $59,980
(LSJUMB) (UO $3.11)
12 3 4 5
The LSJ I M B wears a number of hats — from
performing all-campus rallies to inspiring
sports teams at home and on the toad. Mem
bership in the Band is open to all students,
regardless of musical ability and Band events
serve the entire campus. Every time you've
run with the Band at midnight or jumped in
the middle of "All Right Now" at a spoi ling
event, you see your special lee dollars at work.
The Band is a vital part of Stanford spirit.
Stanford $20,060
Chamber Chorale (B $0.49)
12 3 4 5
T his group has taken on the loft\ goal of
improving Stanford's reputation in the arts
and lias clone an admirable job. All members
of the group must tryout again each year in a
sort of self-enforced re-evaluation process that
contributes to the strength of the group.
Approximately 'UiOO people attend their oil
campus performances each year, and the
group tours national!) and internationally on
an amazingly efficient budget. This group has
worked to increase its visibility on campus
and, in continuing ibis process, will do Stan
ford's music program a great service.
Stanford $ 17,700
Chaparral (UO $0.92)
12 3 4 5
Having just completed its 100 th year of publi
cation, the Stanford (lhaparral ( I lie Chappie)
is the campus' oldest humor publication.
Instantly recognizable with its door-to-door
delivery, The Chappie is known for its annual
Orientation issues and "fake Dailies" as well as
a number of othei publications throughout
the year. T he group lias asked for a nominal
increase in special lee and seeks to publish an
additional issue next year, making better use
of special fee funds. In addition, The Chappie
has greatly increased its advertising campaign,
drawing in new sources of revenue to sup
plant special fee funding.
Stanford Community $6,196
Carnival (UO $0.32)
12 3 4 5

Stanford Community Carnival brings 500 to
1000 elementary school children and their
families to Stanford every spring quarter to
enjoy a day of free, safe fun put on by Stan
lord undergraduates from all across cam
pus. Dorms sponsor booths at the Carnival,
as do many clubs, sports teams, and other
student organizations. This year, without
increasing its special fee request, the Carni
val is expanding to invite the children of
Stanford workers and faculty, as well as
those who have been invited in the past —
children from Kast Palo Alto, East Menlo
Park, and the surrounding community. The
Community Carnival brings together Stan
lord students from across years, majors and
interests, particularly through its appeal to
students who may not necessarily consider
themselves "activists," to reach underprivi
leged children and provide them, as well as
their families and Stanford stall and faculty
families, with meaningful connections to
Stanford.
Stanford Concerts 7 2 /670
Network (B $1.76)
12 3 4 5
Stanford Concert Network both organizes
and co-sponsors a variety of events through
out their year in an effort to provide quality
entertainment to Stanford students at little
or no cost. This year, the Concert Network
programs included the Coffee House series,
the Sir Mix-A-Lot show at the Mausoleum,
and the Roots show. They have a salaried
stall and have introduced an unpaid intern
ship program. The group plans to increase
its programming in the coining year, as well
as the caliber of the artists it brings to the
University, which, in part, is responsible for
the large increase in their special fee request
this year. The group reaches the entire cam
pus through its co-sponsorships of a wide
range of events with a diverse group of orga
nizations who could not produce their
events without the support of the Concert
Network.
Stanford Film $31,980
Society (UO $1.66)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Film Society is the only group
on campus devoted to the promotion of film
as an art, educational and entertainment
medium. Its free film screenings and assis
tance to undergraduates in the production of
films fills the void left by the lac k of an under
graduate film studies curriculum at Stanford.
1 hough the group has decreased its special
fee request this year, it could make more of an
attempt to seek outside sources of funding. It
could also better advertise its events to the
Stanford community in an effort to serve the
campus more effectively.
Stanford in $22,838
Government (UO$1.18)
12 3 4 5
/ v...-
Fhrough fellowships, speakers series, election
drives and other activities, Stanford in C.ov
ernment provides an invaluable political ser
\ ice to Stanford students. The group has clone
extensive outside fundraising and consistently
spends the majority of their special fee money
each year. This is the only non-partisan politi
cal group on campus, is efficiently run and
works to expand their programming each
year.
Stanford Jazz $20,130
Orchestra (UO $1.04)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Jazz Orchestra is the only stu
dent-run group focusing on jazz, and there
lore provides ;i potentially valuable service to
this campus. However, the organization's
biggest shortcoming is that its performances
do not drav\ much of a student audience. Fur
thermore, up till now, it has sought very little
outside funding and instead relies heavily on
special fees.

Stanford $15,195
Mock Trial (UO $0.79)
12 3 4 5
Stanlbrd Mock Trial aims to increase knowl
edge of the American legal system through
participation in events held by the American
Mock Trial Association. The groups has
increased its special fee request this year by
0.71 percent in order to decrease the amount
of money that each student must contribute in
order to attend the regional and national com
petitions that they have qualified for. Though
the group has done an excellent job of seeking
outside sources of funding and of efficiently
using their money, they only reach a very
small portion of the Stanford community.
They should make more of an attempt to
reach out to the Stanford community in the
future.
Stanford Project $4,531
On Nutrition (UO $0.24)
12 3 4 5
For 11 years SPOON has been collecting
unused food from campus residences for dis
tribution to area food pantries for the hungry.
SPOON is requesting a larger special fee, but
has planned some increases in programming
to necessitate this rise. They have a gocxl sense
of their constituency and have consistently
found outside sources of funding, the best
example of which is their efficient use of left
over campus food to alleviate hunger in the
communities surrounding Stanford.
Stanford Solar $31,202
Car Project (UO $1.62)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Solar Car Project comprises
graduate and undergraduate students with an
interest in engineering who design and build
a solar car which is then used in races and dis
played at events. Most of the group's funding
comes from outside donations of product
materials from companies, but given the
heavy cost of such a project the group should
do more to attract corporate monetary spon
sorship. Furthermore, as it is already limited
to a particular campus constituency, the
group needs to strengthen its campus out
reach efforts, so that more students are aware
of its presence.
Stanford's $24,098.80
Women (UO $1.25)
Coalition
12 3 4 5
The Women's Coalition is a strong umbrella
group that coordinates the needs and activi
ties of the various women's groups on campus.
The Coalition serves an important purpose, as
many of the groups under the Coalition could
not operate without spec ial fees and benefit by
having connections to other women's groups.
The Coalition also evaluates groups consis
tently, and has streamlined its budget this year
so that its special lee request is a decrease from
last year's.
Students for $9,085.76
Environmental (UO $0.47)
Action at Stanford
12 3 4 5
SFAS is an activist group working on environ
mental justice issues. This year, the group has
made efforts to educate the campus about local
environmental justice campaigns, in addition
to bringing speakers to campus and participat
ing in the annual Dis-Orientation Conference
in the fall. Although SEAS offers an important
space for student activists with broad interests,
the group could benefit the community more
by reaching out to the campus mainstream.
Without the support of SEAS, however, many
smaller environmental groups would not exist,
making its presence essential.

NEW GROUPS
ASSU Online $16,500
Course Guide (UO $0.86)
12 3 4 5
The ASSU Online Course Guide has under
gone a dramatic transformation over the last
three years, ending in its current iteration —
a site that includes all the information of both
the Time Schedule and the Bulletin in fully
searchable form. Although the site provides
an invaluable service from which many stu
dents would benefit greatly, it is woefully
underpublicized, making improved publicity
a top priority for this group next year.
Electrolytes $5,250
(UO $0.27)
12 3 4 5
The Electrolytes were formed recently to pro
mote Electronica music on campus in safe
environments that can act as alternatives to
raves. The group is still a new one and does
not yet have a strong sense of constituency —
most of its 50 to 60 members participate in the
group through an e-mail list. The Electrolytes
need to make stronger efforts in the coming
year to solidify its internal organization and, in
promoting their organization, the Electrolytes
should consider carefully how best to reach
the larger student community, specifically
those who would not regularly attend events
like those the Electrolytes sponsor.
Graduate Women's $14,340
Network (GO $0.65)
12 3 4 5
The Graduate Women's Network acts as an
academic, support, information and activities
network, formed and led by graduate women
of all disciplines. It seeks to bring graduate
women together in a supportive and collabo
rative environment to foster academic
achievement and personal wellness. It also
reaches out to the wives of graduate students
and to undergraduate women in the hopes of
providing a mentoring relationship. The
group did not apply for a special fee last year,
but it does receive outside sources of funding
in an attempt to reduce the amount it needs to
seek from special fees. Through multiple pro
grams held in the past two years, the Gradu
ate Women's Network has proven itself to be
deserving of a special fee.
Muslim Students $13,087
Awareness (UO $0.32)
Network
12 3 4 5
MSAN is a non-religious student organization
whose main goal is to bring more awareness to
campus about issues pertaining to the Muslim
world. All MSAN events are open to the pub
lic, drawing both undergraduates and gradu
ates as well as alumni and members of the
local community. MSAN has taken the initia
tive to seek out groups such as BSU and the
Jewish Studies Department to co-sponsor
many of their events, and they have consis
tently been able to raise awareness about
many controversial issues in an extremely
timely fashion.
Students $14,772.35
Organizing (UO $0.77)
Committee for the Arts
12 3 4 5
SOCA strives to fill the need for resources for
students who are interested in the arts but not
at the competitive level. This group was suc
cessful in organizing "An Art Affair," which
brought student performers and artists to cen
ter stage in White Plaza. This group serves an
important purpose of improving the percep
tion of the arts on campus.
In mi effort to mike informed special-fee

hbdrd spent numerous hours during the frfist two
weeks revieumg the budgets and ASSU Elections
Handbook statements submitted by student groups
requesting sperm I fees to the ASSU. The members
<>l the editorial board also met with representatives
of each oj the groups and asked them about the
group's goals, its accomplishments during the past
year, plans for expansion or improvement in the
towing academic year and how special-fee funds
would be spent.
liased on the submitted information and
intervieji' discussions, the board reached an
endorsement decision for each group based on a
majority vote within the board. The board has
tried to include as much information about each
group as possible in the explanation of its
endorsements. The Daily encourages all students
to obtain a co/ry of the ASSI! Elections Handbook
and read each group's statement and budget to
reach then own concliisums.

ing during spring break. ASH definitively
serves a need I hat would otherwise go unmet
and would be missed should it not exist on
campus. The program needs its special fees
to continue operating and has made exten
sive efforts this past year to fundraise outside
of special fees. Since the program must limit
itself to a certain number of trips and stu
dents, ASH could increase its programming
in the spring quarter, such as holding
forums or dorm talks, so that participants
and leaders can share their service experi
ences with other students.

Asian American $28,569
Students (UO $ 1.48)
Association
12 3 4 5
AASA is an umbrella organization that pro
vides resources and support for 10 Asian-
American student groups. Its three-pronged
focus, on social, cultural and political issues, is
a well-executed one, making it a group that
would definitely be missed if it didn't exist.
AASA also makes an admirable effort to
fundraise and bring in money for its groups
outside of the monies it receives from special
fees, and it could focus on this more for the
upcoming year. AASA's programming is slay
ing balanced next year and will not increase to
any great extent, in conjunction with only a
I.() percent increase in special fee requests
from last year.
ASSU $89,770
Legal Counseling (B $2.18)
12 3 4 5
The ASSU Legal Counseling Office has pro
vided free legal advice to Stanford students
for many years. Although the LCO cannot
represent students in court, their staff attor
neys focus on "preventative law" and will
answer questions about parking tickets,
bankruptcy, and divorce, among other
issues. This past year, the LCO advised
about 700 graduate students and 400 under
graduates. Although their special fee request
is large, the service they provide is a huge
asset to the student body. However, it is
important that the LCO increase its publici
ty efforts dramatically since many students
are completely unaware that this invaluable
service even exists.
ASSU $121,901
Speakers Bureau (B $2.93)
12 3 4 5
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a student-run
organization that brings well-known speak
ers to campus, organizes debates and panel
discussions on current events and co-spon
sors other student groups' speaking events
and discussions. The group increased their
budget by 3.1 percent in order to increase
the amount of money they have available to
advertise their events and to have more
money available to attract world-renowned
speakers to campus. Fart of the ASSU Speak
ers Bureau special fee is used to pay the
salaries of its two officers. Providing free lec

tures by famous figures and assisting other
groups in doing the same makes the ASSU
Speakers Bureau a valuable organization on
campus whose presence would be missed.
Barrio $21,299.84
Assistance (UO $1.11)
12 3 4 5
This group has tutored school-age children
for 28 years, and they have a lot to show for
it, having used that time to build a presti
gious and effective program for area youth
who would have no exposure to a university
like Stanford otherwise. Their budget is
meticulously and efficiently organized and
they work very hard to establish outside
funding. They provide a strong link between
children in East Palo Alto and Stanford stu
dents. Barrio Assistance, in providing a stim
ulating experience of Stanford for young
children who return year after year, is truly
an invaluable asset to the community.
Black $27,270
Student Union (UO $1.41)
12 3 4 5
l he Black Student Union, a vital part of the
African-American community at Stanford, has
demonstrated a clear sense of purpose and
constituency as well as a broad range of pro
gramming designed to benefit not only the
Stanford community, but also, local areas.
Special fees provide funding for events such as
the Kwanzaa celebration, a welcome reception
for black freshmen during orientation, the
Soul Food Dinner and the BSU's high school
conference which is an important outreach
into Bay Area communities. In addition, the
BSU cosponsors many events with other cam
pus organizations such as the Kevin Powell
lecture this year, and the group plans to lix us
on attracting a prominent speaker to campus
in the coming year.
Club Sports $154,440
(B $3.75)
12 3 4 5
The Club Sports special fee provides fund
ing for the 18 Club Sports teams ranging
from squash to mountain hiking. These
teams receive little funding from the Athlet
ic Department, and the special fee is used to
cover the costs of equipment, travel and
other expenses. Stanford's Club Sports
teams enjoy unparalleled success around the

country with teams such as women's rugby
and women's ultimate Frisbee capturing
national titles last year. The special lee is cru
cial to the continuation oi" the hugely suc
cessful Club Sports program.
International $9,791.30
Undergraduate (UO $0.51)
Community
12 3 4 5
As the only on-campus group serving Stan
lord's population of international students
through events such as International Stu
dent Orientation, dinners, workshops and
cultural activities, lUC 112 ulfills a vital function
that would otherwise go unmet. However,
despite this apparent focus on international
students, the organization is open to every
one and attempts to reach out to students
from all backgrounds in its programming.
Moreover, this year's special fee request rep
resents only a small request increase from
last year's fee.
Kids with $9,134.39
Dreams (UO $0.47)
12 3 4 5
Kids with Dreams is a community service
organization whose primary goal in previous
years has been outreach to developmentally
handicapped children in the Bay Area. In the
last year, this organization has been successful
in also hosting a large, extremely successful,
and very well-organized conference introduc
ing the idea of "social entrepreneurship,"
demonstrating the group's commitment to the
campus community at large. Along with a
decrease in this year's special fee request, their
budgets reflect an efficient use of funding, and
they have been diligent in seeking alternate
sources of funding.
KZSU $84,944
(UO $2.06)
12 3 4 5
As a student-run radio station featuring sev
eral types of programming, including news,
sporting events, and music, KZSU provides
a valuable service to the campus. However,
the station could be more active in its overall
publicity efforts to make others more aware
of its presence. Furthermore, the organiza
tion has run into some problems with debt in
recent years that it must attempt to rectify
immediately.

MEChA $34,911
(UO $1.81)
12 3 4 5
MEChA is a well-organized, strong group that
provides programming focused on addressing
the needs of Chicano/a and Latino/a students
on campus, as well as bringing the culture to
the greater Stanford community. MEChA
does very well in fundraising and is active in
the community, providing students with the
chance to be involved in activism surrounding
issues ranging from Webb Ranch to the
grapes boycott. The group holds a variety of
different programs dining the year, from
Caesar Chavez Commemoration Week to Dia
de los Muertos, and it serves an important role
in the community.
Mind's Eye $13,146
(UO $0.68)
12 3 4 5
1 he Mind's Eye publishes two issues a year of
student photography, poetry, short stories,
and painting. As the only literary magazine on
campus, the Mind's Eye serves an important
need that would otherwise go unmet. While
these students strive to produce a high-quality
journal of expression, a much larger effort at
publicity is necessary for this group to serve
the larger campus most effectively.
NAACP $15,395
(UO $0.80)
12 3 4 5
Requesting a special fee for the second year, the
Stanford chapter of the NAACP has done a
good job of re-organizing its budget to address
problems noted in its first year of using special
fees with only a modest increase in its special lee
request. The group has a strong sense of its
constituency, serving it in many ways, including
through the co-sponsorship of events with
other organizations. In addition, given the role
of the NAACP across the nation, it is important
for Stanford to have its own chapter of this
prestigious organization.
Project $6,153
Motivation (UO $0.32)
12 3 4 5
Project Motivation works to expose at-risk
youth to the benefits of college by bringing
them to Stanford in an effort to put them on
the track to success. The group organizes
events like "A Day with an Undergrad," pro
vides information packets on applying to col
lege, and has even seen its own graduates go
on to attend Stanford. This 20-year-old pro
grain decreased its special lee request by 1 I
percent this year, spending their its efficiently
in addition to serving an important purpose
in a creative and committed way.
SCBN $19,195
(B $0.47)
12 3 4 5
The most impressive thing about this group is
the fact that they have managed to reduce this
year's special fee request by 14 percent. How
ever, the rest of their goals for next year seem
a bit hazy and unrealistic. The group is defi
nitely a plus for students as it provides the
campus with free cable, but the actual number
of people who choose to use this service is
unclear.
Stanford $30,251
American Indian (UO $1.57)
Organization
12 3 4 5
SAIO serves as the social, political and cultur
al center for the American Indian, Alaska
Native and Native Hawaiian communities at
Stanford. The group is responsible for the

Stanford Powwow, as well as a number of
other campus cultural events to reflect the
diverse traditions of Native American culture.
The group has demonstrated a clear sense of
its own constituency, but SAIO events do
reach the entire campus, not just the Ameri
can Indian population. SAIO is the primary
organization responsible for the Native Amer
ican community and is a valuable asset to a
culturally diverse Stanford campus.
Stanford Axe $ 10,185
Committee (UO $0.53)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Axe Committee was founded
to maintain the traditions of the University
and its Athletics Department. Its responsibil
ities include annual Big Came week activi
ties, the protection of the Axe when it is on
campus and the distribution of a handbook
for freshmen containing the history and tra
ditions of Stanford. The group has minimal
sources of funding and relies almost entirely
on its special fee to continue its operation.
Axe Coimn currently serves an important
112 unction but could make more of an effort to
be active outside of the football season.
Besides occasional attendance at some spoi l
ing events and the sponsoring of the I'risbee
golf tournament in the spring, the group is
not visible on campus after fall quarter. Axe
Comm needs to address the above issues
before it can become a wise investment for
the Stanford Community.
Stanford Band $59,980
(LSJUMB) (UO $3.11)
12 3 4 5
The LSJ I M B wears a number of hats — from
performing all-campus rallies to inspiring
sports teams at home and on the toad. Mem
bership in the Band is open to all students,
regardless of musical ability and Band events
serve the entire campus. Every time you've
run with the Band at midnight or jumped in
the middle of "All Right Now" at a spoi ling
event, you see your special lee dollars at work.
The Band is a vital part of Stanford spirit.
Stanford $20,060
Chamber Chorale (B $0.49)
12 3 4 5
T his group has taken on the loft\ goal of
improving Stanford's reputation in the arts
and lias clone an admirable job. All members
of the group must tryout again each year in a
sort of self-enforced re-evaluation process that
contributes to the strength of the group.
Approximately 'UiOO people attend their oil
campus performances each year, and the
group tours national!) and internationally on
an amazingly efficient budget. This group has
worked to increase its visibility on campus
and, in continuing ibis process, will do Stan
ford's music program a great service.
Stanford $ 17,700
Chaparral (UO $0.92)
12 3 4 5
Having just completed its 100 th year of publi
cation, the Stanford (lhaparral ( I lie Chappie)
is the campus' oldest humor publication.
Instantly recognizable with its door-to-door
delivery, The Chappie is known for its annual
Orientation issues and "fake Dailies" as well as
a number of othei publications throughout
the year. T he group lias asked for a nominal
increase in special lee and seeks to publish an
additional issue next year, making better use
of special fee funds. In addition, The Chappie
has greatly increased its advertising campaign,
drawing in new sources of revenue to sup
plant special fee funding.
Stanford Community $6,196
Carnival (UO $0.32)
12 3 4 5

Stanford Community Carnival brings 500 to
1000 elementary school children and their
families to Stanford every spring quarter to
enjoy a day of free, safe fun put on by Stan
lord undergraduates from all across cam
pus. Dorms sponsor booths at the Carnival,
as do many clubs, sports teams, and other
student organizations. This year, without
increasing its special fee request, the Carni
val is expanding to invite the children of
Stanford workers and faculty, as well as
those who have been invited in the past —
children from Kast Palo Alto, East Menlo
Park, and the surrounding community. The
Community Carnival brings together Stan
lord students from across years, majors and
interests, particularly through its appeal to
students who may not necessarily consider
themselves "activists," to reach underprivi
leged children and provide them, as well as
their families and Stanford stall and faculty
families, with meaningful connections to
Stanford.
Stanford Concerts 7 2 /670
Network (B $1.76)
12 3 4 5
Stanford Concert Network both organizes
and co-sponsors a variety of events through
out their year in an effort to provide quality
entertainment to Stanford students at little
or no cost. This year, the Concert Network
programs included the Coffee House series,
the Sir Mix-A-Lot show at the Mausoleum,
and the Roots show. They have a salaried
stall and have introduced an unpaid intern
ship program. The group plans to increase
its programming in the coining year, as well
as the caliber of the artists it brings to the
University, which, in part, is responsible for
the large increase in their special fee request
this year. The group reaches the entire cam
pus through its co-sponsorships of a wide
range of events with a diverse group of orga
nizations who could not produce their
events without the support of the Concert
Network.
Stanford Film $31,980
Society (UO $1.66)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Film Society is the only group
on campus devoted to the promotion of film
as an art, educational and entertainment
medium. Its free film screenings and assis
tance to undergraduates in the production of
films fills the void left by the lac k of an under
graduate film studies curriculum at Stanford.
1 hough the group has decreased its special
fee request this year, it could make more of an
attempt to seek outside sources of funding. It
could also better advertise its events to the
Stanford community in an effort to serve the
campus more effectively.
Stanford in $22,838
Government (UO$1.18)
12 3 4 5
/ v...-
Fhrough fellowships, speakers series, election
drives and other activities, Stanford in C.ov
ernment provides an invaluable political ser
\ ice to Stanford students. The group has clone
extensive outside fundraising and consistently
spends the majority of their special fee money
each year. This is the only non-partisan politi
cal group on campus, is efficiently run and
works to expand their programming each
year.
Stanford Jazz $20,130
Orchestra (UO $1.04)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Jazz Orchestra is the only stu
dent-run group focusing on jazz, and there
lore provides ;i potentially valuable service to
this campus. However, the organization's
biggest shortcoming is that its performances
do not drav\ much of a student audience. Fur
thermore, up till now, it has sought very little
outside funding and instead relies heavily on
special fees.

Stanford $15,195
Mock Trial (UO $0.79)
12 3 4 5
Stanlbrd Mock Trial aims to increase knowl
edge of the American legal system through
participation in events held by the American
Mock Trial Association. The groups has
increased its special fee request this year by
0.71 percent in order to decrease the amount
of money that each student must contribute in
order to attend the regional and national com
petitions that they have qualified for. Though
the group has done an excellent job of seeking
outside sources of funding and of efficiently
using their money, they only reach a very
small portion of the Stanford community.
They should make more of an attempt to
reach out to the Stanford community in the
future.
Stanford Project $4,531
On Nutrition (UO $0.24)
12 3 4 5
For 11 years SPOON has been collecting
unused food from campus residences for dis
tribution to area food pantries for the hungry.
SPOON is requesting a larger special fee, but
has planned some increases in programming
to necessitate this rise. They have a gocxl sense
of their constituency and have consistently
found outside sources of funding, the best
example of which is their efficient use of left
over campus food to alleviate hunger in the
communities surrounding Stanford.
Stanford Solar $31,202
Car Project (UO $1.62)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Solar Car Project comprises
graduate and undergraduate students with an
interest in engineering who design and build
a solar car which is then used in races and dis
played at events. Most of the group's funding
comes from outside donations of product
materials from companies, but given the
heavy cost of such a project the group should
do more to attract corporate monetary spon
sorship. Furthermore, as it is already limited
to a particular campus constituency, the
group needs to strengthen its campus out
reach efforts, so that more students are aware
of its presence.
Stanford's $24,098.80
Women (UO $1.25)
Coalition
12 3 4 5
The Women's Coalition is a strong umbrella
group that coordinates the needs and activi
ties of the various women's groups on campus.
The Coalition serves an important purpose, as
many of the groups under the Coalition could
not operate without spec ial fees and benefit by
having connections to other women's groups.
The Coalition also evaluates groups consis
tently, and has streamlined its budget this year
so that its special lee request is a decrease from
last year's.
Students for $9,085.76
Environmental (UO $0.47)
Action at Stanford
12 3 4 5
SFAS is an activist group working on environ
mental justice issues. This year, the group has
made efforts to educate the campus about local
environmental justice campaigns, in addition
to bringing speakers to campus and participat
ing in the annual Dis-Orientation Conference
in the fall. Although SEAS offers an important
space for student activists with broad interests,
the group could benefit the community more
by reaching out to the campus mainstream.
Without the support of SEAS, however, many
smaller environmental groups would not exist,
making its presence essential.

NEW GROUPS
ASSU Online $16,500
Course Guide (UO $0.86)
12 3 4 5
The ASSU Online Course Guide has under
gone a dramatic transformation over the last
three years, ending in its current iteration —
a site that includes all the information of both
the Time Schedule and the Bulletin in fully
searchable form. Although the site provides
an invaluable service from which many stu
dents would benefit greatly, it is woefully
underpublicized, making improved publicity
a top priority for this group next year.
Electrolytes $5,250
(UO $0.27)
12 3 4 5
The Electrolytes were formed recently to pro
mote Electronica music on campus in safe
environments that can act as alternatives to
raves. The group is still a new one and does
not yet have a strong sense of constituency —
most of its 50 to 60 members participate in the
group through an e-mail list. The Electrolytes
need to make stronger efforts in the coming
year to solidify its internal organization and, in
promoting their organization, the Electrolytes
should consider carefully how best to reach
the larger student community, specifically
those who would not regularly attend events
like those the Electrolytes sponsor.
Graduate Women's $14,340
Network (GO $0.65)
12 3 4 5
The Graduate Women's Network acts as an
academic, support, information and activities
network, formed and led by graduate women
of all disciplines. It seeks to bring graduate
women together in a supportive and collabo
rative environment to foster academic
achievement and personal wellness. It also
reaches out to the wives of graduate students
and to undergraduate women in the hopes of
providing a mentoring relationship. The
group did not apply for a special fee last year,
but it does receive outside sources of funding
in an attempt to reduce the amount it needs to
seek from special fees. Through multiple pro
grams held in the past two years, the Gradu
ate Women's Network has proven itself to be
deserving of a special fee.
Muslim Students $13,087
Awareness (UO $0.32)
Network
12 3 4 5
MSAN is a non-religious student organization
whose main goal is to bring more awareness to
campus about issues pertaining to the Muslim
world. All MSAN events are open to the pub
lic, drawing both undergraduates and gradu
ates as well as alumni and members of the
local community. MSAN has taken the initia
tive to seek out groups such as BSU and the
Jewish Studies Department to co-sponsor
many of their events, and they have consis
tently been able to raise awareness about
many controversial issues in an extremely
timely fashion.
Students $14,772.35
Organizing (UO $0.77)
Committee for the Arts
12 3 4 5
SOCA strives to fill the need for resources for
students who are interested in the arts but not
at the competitive level. This group was suc
cessful in organizing "An Art Affair," which
brought student performers and artists to cen
ter stage in White Plaza. This group serves an
important purpose of improving the percep
tion of the arts on campus.
In mi effort to mike informed special-fee

hbdrd spent numerous hours during the frfist two
weeks revieumg the budgets and ASSU Elections
Handbook statements submitted by student groups
requesting sperm I fees to the ASSU. The members
<>l the editorial board also met with representatives
of each oj the groups and asked them about the
group's goals, its accomplishments during the past
year, plans for expansion or improvement in the
towing academic year and how special-fee funds
would be spent.
liased on the submitted information and
intervieji' discussions, the board reached an
endorsement decision for each group based on a
majority vote within the board. The board has
tried to include as much information about each
group as possible in the explanation of its
endorsements. The Daily encourages all students

serves a need I hat would otherwise go unmet
and would be missed should it not exist on
campus. The program needs its special fees
to continue operating and has made exten
sive efforts this past year to fundraise outside
of special fees. Since the program must limit
itself to a certain number of trips and stu
dents, ASH could increase its programming
in the spring quarter, such as holding
forums or dorm talks, so that participants
and leaders can share their service experi
ences with other students.

Asian American $28,569
Students (UO $ 1.48)
Association
12 3 4 5
AASA is an umbrella organization that pro
vides resources and support for 10 Asian-
American student groups. Its three-pronged
focus, on social, cultural and political issues, is
a well-executed one, making it a group that
would definitely be missed if it didn't exist.
AASA also makes an admirable effort to
fundraise and bring in money for its groups
outside of the monies it receives from special
fees, and it could focus on this more for the
upcoming year. AASA's programming is slay
ing balanced next year and will not increase to
any great extent, in conjunction with only a
I.() percent increase in special fee requests
from last year.
ASSU $89,770
Legal Counseling (B $2.18)
12 3 4 5
The ASSU Legal Counseling Office has pro
vided free legal advice to Stanford students
for many years. Although the LCO cannot
represent students in court, their staff attor
neys focus on "preventative law" and will
answer questions about parking tickets,
bankruptcy, and divorce, among other
issues. This past year, the LCO advised
about 700 graduate students and 400 under
graduates. Although their special fee request
is large, the service they provide is a huge
asset to the student body. However, it is
important that the LCO increase its publici
ty efforts dramatically since many students
are completely unaware that this invaluable
service even exists.
ASSU $121,901
Speakers Bureau (B $2.93)
12 3 4 5
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a student-run
organization that brings well-known speak

discussions on current events and co-spon
sors other student groups' speaking events
and discussions. The group increased their
budget by 3.1 percent in order to increase
the amount of money they have available to
advertise their events and to have more
money available to attract world-renowned
speakers to campus. Fart of the ASSU Speak
ers Bureau special fee is used to pay the
salaries of its two officers. Providing free lec

groups in doing the same makes the ASSU
Speakers Bureau a valuable organization on
campus whose presence would be missed.

funding. They provide a strong link between
children in East Palo Alto and Stanford stu
dents. Barrio Assistance, in providing a stim
ulating experience of Stanford for young
children who return year after year, is truly
an invaluable asset to the community.
Black $27,270
Student Union (UO $1.41)
12 3 4 5
l he Black Student Union, a vital part of the
African-American community at Stanford, has
demonstrated a clear sense of purpose and
constituency as well as a broad range of pro
gramming designed to benefit not only the
Stanford community, but also, local areas.
Special fees provide funding for events such as
the Kwanzaa celebration, a welcome reception
for black freshmen during orientation, the
Soul Food Dinner and the BSU's high school
conference which is an important outreach
into Bay Area communities. In addition, the
BSU cosponsors many events with other cam
pus organizations such as the Kevin Powell
lecture this year, and the group plans to lix us
on attracting a prominent speaker to campus
in the coming year.
Club Sports $154,440
(B $3.75)
12 3 4 5
The Club Sports special fee provides fund
ing for the 18 Club Sports teams ranging
from squash to mountain hiking. These
teams receive little funding from the Athlet
ic Department, and the special fee is used to
cover the costs of equipment, travel and
other expenses. Stanford's Club Sports
teams enjoy unparalleled success around the

country with teams such as women's rugby
and women's ultimate Frisbee capturing
national titles last year. The special lee is cru
cial to the continuation oi" the hugely suc
cessful Club Sports program.
International $9,791.30
Undergraduate (UO $0.51)
Community
12 3 4 5
As the only on-campus group serving Stan
lord's population of international students
through events such as International Stu
dent Orientation, dinners, workshops and
cultural activities, lUC 112 ulfills a vital function
that would otherwise go unmet. However,
despite this apparent focus on international
students, the organization is open to every
one and attempts to reach out to students
from all backgrounds in its programming.
Moreover, this year's special fee request rep
resents only a small request increase from
last year's fee.
Kids with $9,134.39
Dreams (UO $0.47)
12 3 4 5
Kids with Dreams is a community service
organization whose primary goal in previous
years has been outreach to developmentally
handicapped children in the Bay Area. In the
last year, this organization has been successful
in also hosting a large, extremely successful,
and very well-organized conference introduc
ing the idea of "social entrepreneurship,"
demonstrating the group's commitment to the
campus community at large. Along with a
decrease in this year's special fee request, their
budgets reflect an efficient use of funding, and
they have been diligent in seeking alternate
sources of funding.
KZSU $84,944
(UO $2.06)
12 3 4 5
As a student-run radio station featuring sev
eral types of programming, including news,
sporting events, and music, KZSU provides
a valuable service to the campus. However,
the station could be more active in its overall
publicity efforts to make others more aware
of its presence. Furthermore, the organiza
tion has run into some problems with debt in
recent years that it must attempt to rectify
immediately.

MEChA $34,911
(UO $1.81)
12 3 4 5
MEChA is a well-organized, strong group that
provides programming focused on addressing
the needs of Chicano/a and Latino/a students
on campus, as well as bringing the culture to
the greater Stanford community. MEChA
does very well in fundraising and is active in
the community, providing students with the
chance to be involved in activism surrounding
issues ranging from Webb Ranch to the
grapes boycott. The group holds a variety of
different programs dining the year, from
Caesar Chavez Commemoration Week to Dia
de los Muertos, and it serves an important role
in the community.
Mind's Eye $13,146
(UO $0.68)
12 3 4 5
1 he Mind's Eye publishes two issues a year of
student photography, poetry, short stories,
and painting. As the only literary magazine on
campus, the Mind's Eye serves an important
need that would otherwise go unmet. While
these students strive to produce a high-quality
journal of expression, a much larger effort at
publicity is necessary for this group to serve
the larger campus most effectively.
NAACP $15,395
(UO $0.80)
12 3 4 5
Requesting a special fee for the second year, the
Stanford chapter of the NAACP has done a
good job of re-organizing its budget to address
problems noted in its first year of using special
fees with only a modest increase in its special lee
request. The group has a strong sense of its
constituency, serving it in many ways, including
through the co-sponsorship of events with
other organizations. In addition, given the role
of the NAACP across the nation, it is important
for Stanford to have its own chapter of this
prestigious organization.
Project $6,153
Motivation (UO $0.32)
12 3 4 5
Project Motivation works to expose at-risk
youth to the benefits of college by bringing
them to Stanford in an effort to put them on
the track to success. The group organizes
events like "A Day with an Undergrad," pro
vides information packets on applying to col
lege, and has even seen its own graduates go
on to attend Stanford. This 20-year-old pro
grain decreased its special lee request by 1 I
percent this year, spending their its efficiently
in addition to serving an important purpose
in a creative and committed way.
SCBN $19,195
(B $0.47)
12 3 4 5
The most impressive thing about this group is
the fact that they have managed to reduce this
year's special fee request by 14 percent. How
ever, the rest of their goals for next year seem
a bit hazy and unrealistic. The group is defi
nitely a plus for students as it provides the
campus with free cable, but the actual number
of people who choose to use this service is
unclear.
Stanford $30,251
American Indian (UO $1.57)
Organization
12 3 4 5
SAIO serves as the social, political and cultur
al center for the American Indian, Alaska
Native and Native Hawaiian communities at
Stanford. The group is responsible for the

Stanford Powwow, as well as a number of
other campus cultural events to reflect the
diverse traditions of Native American culture.
The group has demonstrated a clear sense of
its own constituency, but SAIO events do
reach the entire campus, not just the Ameri
can Indian population. SAIO is the primary
organization responsible for the Native Amer
ican community and is a valuable asset to a
culturally diverse Stanford campus.
Stanford Axe $ 10,185
Committee (UO $0.53)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Axe Committee was founded
to maintain the traditions of the University
and its Athletics Department. Its responsibil
ities include annual Big Came week activi
ties, the protection of the Axe when it is on
campus and the distribution of a handbook
for freshmen containing the history and tra
ditions of Stanford. The group has minimal
sources of funding and relies almost entirely
on its special fee to continue its operation.
Axe Coimn currently serves an important
112 unction but could make more of an effort to
be active outside of the football season.
Besides occasional attendance at some spoi l
ing events and the sponsoring of the I'risbee
golf tournament in the spring, the group is
not visible on campus after fall quarter. Axe
Comm needs to address the above issues
before it can become a wise investment for
the Stanford Community.
Stanford Band $59,980
(LSJUMB) (UO $3.11)
12 3 4 5
The LSJ I M B wears a number of hats — from
performing all-campus rallies to inspiring
sports teams at home and on the toad. Mem
bership in the Band is open to all students,
regardless of musical ability and Band events
serve the entire campus. Every time you've
run with the Band at midnight or jumped in
the middle of "All Right Now" at a spoi ling
event, you see your special lee dollars at work.
The Band is a vital part of Stanford spirit.
Stanford $20,060
Chamber Chorale (B $0.49)
12 3 4 5
T his group has taken on the loft\ goal of
improving Stanford's reputation in the arts
and lias clone an admirable job. All members
of the group must tryout again each year in a
sort of self-enforced re-evaluation process that
contributes to the strength of the group.
Approximately 'UiOO people attend their oil
campus performances each year, and the
group tours national!) and internationally on
an amazingly efficient budget. This group has
worked to increase its visibility on campus
and, in continuing ibis process, will do Stan
ford's music program a great service.
Stanford $ 17,700
Chaparral (UO $0.92)
12 3 4 5
Having just completed its 100 th year of publi
cation, the Stanford (lhaparral ( I lie Chappie)
is the campus' oldest humor publication.
Instantly recognizable with its door-to-door
delivery, The Chappie is known for its annual
Orientation issues and "fake Dailies" as well as
a number of othei publications throughout
the year. T he group lias asked for a nominal
increase in special lee and seeks to publish an
additional issue next year, making better use
of special fee funds. In addition, The Chappie
has greatly increased its advertising campaign,
drawing in new sources of revenue to sup
plant special fee funding.
Stanford Community $6,196
Carnival (UO $0.32)
12 3 4 5

Stanford Community Carnival brings 500 to
1000 elementary school children and their
families to Stanford every spring quarter to
enjoy a day of free, safe fun put on by Stan
lord undergraduates from all across cam
pus. Dorms sponsor booths at the Carnival,
as do many clubs, sports teams, and other
student organizations. This year, without
increasing its special fee request, the Carni
val is expanding to invite the children of
Stanford workers and faculty, as well as
those who have been invited in the past —
children from Kast Palo Alto, East Menlo
Park, and the surrounding community. The
Community Carnival brings together Stan
lord students from across years, majors and
interests, particularly through its appeal to
students who may not necessarily consider
themselves "activists," to reach underprivi
leged children and provide them, as well as
their families and Stanford stall and faculty
families, with meaningful connections to
Stanford.
Stanford Concerts 7 2 /670
Network (B $1.76)
12 3 4 5
Stanford Concert Network both organizes
and co-sponsors a variety of events through
out their year in an effort to provide quality
entertainment to Stanford students at little
or no cost. This year, the Concert Network
programs included the Coffee House series,
the Sir Mix-A-Lot show at the Mausoleum,
and the Roots show. They have a salaried
stall and have introduced an unpaid intern
ship program. The group plans to increase
its programming in the coining year, as well
as the caliber of the artists it brings to the
University, which, in part, is responsible for
the large increase in their special fee request
this year. The group reaches the entire cam
pus through its co-sponsorships of a wide
range of events with a diverse group of orga
nizations who could not produce their
events without the support of the Concert
Network.
Stanford Film $31,980
Society (UO $1.66)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Film Society is the only group
on campus devoted to the promotion of film
as an art, educational and entertainment
medium. Its free film screenings and assis
tance to undergraduates in the production of
films fills the void left by the lac k of an under
graduate film studies curriculum at Stanford.
1 hough the group has decreased its special
fee request this year, it could make more of an
attempt to seek outside sources of funding. It
could also better advertise its events to the
Stanford community in an effort to serve the
campus more effectively.
Stanford in $22,838
Government (UO$1.18)
12 3 4 5
/ v...-
Fhrough fellowships, speakers series, election
drives and other activities, Stanford in C.ov
ernment provides an invaluable political ser
\ ice to Stanford students. The group has clone
extensive outside fundraising and consistently
spends the majority of their special fee money
each year. This is the only non-partisan politi
cal group on campus, is efficiently run and
works to expand their programming each
year.
Stanford Jazz $20,130
Orchestra (UO $1.04)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Jazz Orchestra is the only stu
dent-run group focusing on jazz, and there
lore provides ;i potentially valuable service to
this campus. However, the organization's
biggest shortcoming is that its performances
do not drav\ much of a student audience. Fur
thermore, up till now, it has sought very little
outside funding and instead relies heavily on
special fees.

Stanford $15,195
Mock Trial (UO $0.79)
12 3 4 5
Stanlbrd Mock Trial aims to increase knowl
edge of the American legal system through
participation in events held by the American
Mock Trial Association. The groups has
increased its special fee request this year by
0.71 percent in order to decrease the amount
of money that each student must contribute in
order to attend the regional and national com
petitions that they have qualified for. Though
the group has done an excellent job of seeking
outside sources of funding and of efficiently
using their money, they only reach a very
small portion of the Stanford community.
They should make more of an attempt to
reach out to the Stanford community in the
future.
Stanford Project $4,531
On Nutrition (UO $0.24)
12 3 4 5
For 11 years SPOON has been collecting
unused food from campus residences for dis
tribution to area food pantries for the hungry.
SPOON is requesting a larger special fee, but
has planned some increases in programming
to necessitate this rise. They have a gocxl sense
of their constituency and have consistently
found outside sources of funding, the best
example of which is their efficient use of left
over campus food to alleviate hunger in the
communities surrounding Stanford.
Stanford Solar $31,202
Car Project (UO $1.62)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Solar Car Project comprises
graduate and undergraduate students with an
interest in engineering who design and build
a solar car which is then used in races and dis
played at events. Most of the group's funding
comes from outside donations of product
materials from companies, but given the
heavy cost of such a project the group should
do more to attract corporate monetary spon
sorship. Furthermore, as it is already limited
to a particular campus constituency, the
group needs to strengthen its campus out
reach efforts, so that more students are aware
of its presence.
Stanford's $24,098.80
Women (UO $1.25)
Coalition
12 3 4 5
The Women's Coalition is a strong umbrella
group that coordinates the needs and activi
ties of the various women's groups on campus.
The Coalition serves an important purpose, as
many of the groups under the Coalition could
not operate without spec ial fees and benefit by
having connections to other women's groups.
The Coalition also evaluates groups consis
tently, and has streamlined its budget this year
so that its special lee request is a decrease from
last year's.
Students for $9,085.76
Environmental (UO $0.47)
Action at Stanford
12 3 4 5
SFAS is an activist group working on environ
mental justice issues. This year, the group has
made efforts to educate the campus about local
environmental justice campaigns, in addition
to bringing speakers to campus and participat
ing in the annual Dis-Orientation Conference
in the fall. Although SEAS offers an important
space for student activists with broad interests,
the group could benefit the community more
by reaching out to the campus mainstream.
Without the support of SEAS, however, many
smaller environmental groups would not exist,
making its presence essential.

NEW GROUPS
ASSU Online $16,500
Course Guide (UO $0.86)
12 3 4 5
The ASSU Online Course Guide has under
gone a dramatic transformation over the last
three years, ending in its current iteration —
a site that includes all the information of both
the Time Schedule and the Bulletin in fully
searchable form. Although the site provides
an invaluable service from which many stu
dents would benefit greatly, it is woefully
underpublicized, making improved publicity
a top priority for this group next year.
Electrolytes $5,250
(UO $0.27)
12 3 4 5
The Electrolytes were formed recently to pro
mote Electronica music on campus in safe
environments that can act as alternatives to
raves. The group is still a new one and does
not yet have a strong sense of constituency —
most of its 50 to 60 members participate in the
group through an e-mail list. The Electrolytes
need to make stronger efforts in the coming
year to solidify its internal organization and, in
promoting their organization, the Electrolytes
should consider carefully how best to reach
the larger student community, specifically
those who would not regularly attend events
like those the Electrolytes sponsor.
Graduate Women's $14,340
Network (GO $0.65)
12 3 4 5
The Graduate Women's Network acts as an
academic, support, information and activities
network, formed and led by graduate women
of all disciplines. It seeks to bring graduate
women together in a supportive and collabo
rative environment to foster academic
achievement and personal wellness. It also
reaches out to the wives of graduate students
and to undergraduate women in the hopes of
providing a mentoring relationship. The
group did not apply for a special fee last year,
but it does receive outside sources of funding
in an attempt to reduce the amount it needs to
seek from special fees. Through multiple pro
grams held in the past two years, the Gradu
ate Women's Network has proven itself to be
deserving of a special fee.
Muslim Students $13,087
Awareness (UO $0.32)
Network
12 3 4 5
MSAN is a non-religious student organization
whose main goal is to bring more awareness to
campus about issues pertaining to the Muslim
world. All MSAN events are open to the pub
lic, drawing both undergraduates and gradu
ates as well as alumni and members of the
local community. MSAN has taken the initia
tive to seek out groups such as BSU and the
Jewish Studies Department to co-sponsor
many of their events, and they have consis
tently been able to raise awareness about
many controversial issues in an extremely
timely fashion.
Students $14,772.35
Organizing (UO $0.77)
Committee for the Arts
12 3 4 5
SOCA strives to fill the need for resources for
students who are interested in the arts but not
at the competitive level. This group was suc
cessful in organizing "An Art Affair," which
brought student performers and artists to cen
ter stage in White Plaza. This group serves an
important purpose of improving the percep
tion of the arts on campus.
In mi effort to mike informed special-fee
empmements, members vj The Daily's editorial
hbdrd spent numerous hours during the frfist two
weeks revieumg the budgets and ASSU Elections
Handbook statements submitted by student groups
requesting sperm I fees to the ASSU. The members
<>l the editorial board also met with representatives
of each oj the groups and asked them about the
group's goals, its accomplishments during the past
year, plans for expansion or improvement in the
towing academic year and how special-fee funds
would be spent.
liased on the submitted information and
intervieji' discussions, the board reached an
endorsement decision for each group based on a
majority vote within the board. The board has
tried to include as much information about each
group as possible in the explanation of its
endorsements. The Daily encourages all students
to obtain a co/ry of the ASSI! Elections Handbook
and read each group's statement and budget to

serves a need I hat would otherwise go unmet
and would be missed should it not exist on
campus. The program needs its special fees
to continue operating and has made exten
sive efforts this past year to fundraise outside
of special fees. Since the program must limit
itself to a certain number of trips and stu
dents, ASH could increase its programming
in the spring quarter, such as holding

Asian American $28,569
Students (UO $ 1.48)
Association
12 3 4 5
AASA is an umbrella organization that pro
vides resources and support for 10 Asian-
American student groups. Its three-pronged
focus, on social, cultural and political issues, is
a well-executed one, making it a group that
would definitely be missed if it didn't exist.
AASA also makes an admirable effort to
fundraise and bring in money for its groups
outside of the monies it receives from special
fees, and it could focus on this more for the
upcoming year. AASA's programming is slay
ing balanced next year and will not increase to
any great extent, in conjunction with only a
I.() percent increase in special fee requests
from last year.
ASSU $89,770
Legal Counseling (B $2.18)
12 3 4 5
The ASSU Legal Counseling Office has pro
vided free legal advice to Stanford students
for many years. Although the LCO cannot
represent students in court, their staff attor
neys focus on "preventative law" and will
answer questions about parking tickets,
bankruptcy, and divorce, among other
issues. This past year, the LCO advised
about 700 graduate students and 400 under
graduates. Although their special fee request
is large, the service they provide is a huge
asset to the student body. However, it is
important that the LCO increase its publici
ty efforts dramatically since many students
are completely unaware that this invaluable
service even exists.
ASSU $121,901
Speakers Bureau (B $2.93)
12 3 4 5
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a student-run
organization that brings well-known speak
ers to campus, organizes debates and panel
discussions on current events and co-spon
sors other student groups' speaking events
and discussions. The group increased their
budget by 3.1 percent in order to increase
the amount of money they have available to
advertise their events and to have more
money available to attract world-renowned
speakers to campus. Fart of the ASSU Speak
ers Bureau special fee is used to pay the
salaries of its two officers. Providing free lec

tures by famous figures and assisting other
groups in doing the same makes the ASSU
Speakers Bureau a valuable organization on
campus whose presence would be missed.
Barrio $21,299.84
Assistance (UO $1.11)
12 3 4 5
This group has tutored school-age children
for 28 years, and they have a lot to show for
it, having used that time to build a presti
gious and effective program for area youth
who would have no exposure to a university
like Stanford otherwise. Their budget is
meticulously and efficiently organized and
they work very hard to establish outside
funding. They provide a strong link between
children in East Palo Alto and Stanford stu
dents. Barrio Assistance, in providing a stim

children who return year after year, is truly
an invaluable asset to the community.
Black $27,270
Student Union (UO $1.41)
12 3 4 5
l he Black Student Union, a vital part of the
African-American community at Stanford, has
demonstrated a clear sense of purpose and
constituency as well as a broad range of pro
gramming designed to benefit not only the
Stanford community, but also, local areas.
Special fees provide funding for events such as
the Kwanzaa celebration, a welcome reception
for black freshmen during orientation, the
Soul Food Dinner and the BSU's high school
conference which is an important outreach
into Bay Area communities. In addition, the
BSU cosponsors many events with other cam

lecture this year, and the group plans to lix us
on attracting a prominent speaker to campus
in the coming year.
Club Sports $154,440
(B $3.75)
12 3 4 5
The Club Sports special fee provides fund
ing for the 18 Club Sports teams ranging
from squash to mountain hiking. These
teams receive little funding from the Athlet

cover the costs of equipment, travel and
other expenses. Stanford's Club Sports
teams enjoy unparalleled success around the

country with teams such as women's rugby
and women's ultimate Frisbee capturing
national titles last year. The special lee is cru

12 3 4 5
As the only on-campus group serving Stan
lord's population of international students
through events such as International Stu

cultural activities, lUC 112 ulfills a vital function
that would otherwise go unmet. However,
despite this apparent focus on international
students, the organization is open to every
one and attempts to reach out to students
from all backgrounds in its programming.
Moreover, this year's special fee request rep
resents only a small request increase from
last year's fee.
Kids with $9,134.39
Dreams (UO $0.47)
12 3 4 5
Kids with Dreams is a community service
organization whose primary goal in previous
years has been outreach to developmentally
handicapped children in the Bay Area. In the
last year, this organization has been successful
in also hosting a large, extremely successful,
and very well-organized conference introduc
ing the idea of "social entrepreneurship,"
demonstrating the group's commitment to the
campus community at large. Along with a
decrease in this year's special fee request, their
budgets reflect an efficient use of funding, and
they have been diligent in seeking alternate
sources of funding.
KZSU $84,944
(UO $2.06)
12 3 4 5
As a student-run radio station featuring sev

sporting events, and music, KZSU provides
a valuable service to the campus. However,
the station could be more active in its overall
publicity efforts to make others more aware
of its presence. Furthermore, the organiza

recent years that it must attempt to rectify
immediately.

MEChA $34,911
(UO $1.81)
12 3 4 5
MEChA is a well-organized, strong group that

does very well in fundraising and is active in
the community, providing students with the
chance to be involved in activism surrounding
issues ranging from Webb Ranch to the
grapes boycott. The group holds a variety of
different programs dining the year, from
Caesar Chavez Commemoration Week to Dia
de los Muertos, and it serves an important role
in the community.
Mind's Eye $13,146
(UO $0.68)
12 3 4 5
1 he Mind's Eye publishes two issues a year of
student photography, poetry, short stories,
and painting. As the only literary magazine on
campus, the Mind's Eye serves an important
need that would otherwise go unmet. While
these students strive to produce a high-quality
journal of expression, a much larger effort at
publicity is necessary for this group to serve
the larger campus most effectively.
NAACP $15,395
(UO $0.80)
12 3 4 5
Requesting a special fee for the second year, the
Stanford chapter of the NAACP has done a
good job of re-organizing its budget to address
problems noted in its first year of using special
fees with only a modest increase in its special lee
request. The group has a strong sense of its
constituency, serving it in many ways, including
through the co-sponsorship of events with
other organizations. In addition, given the role
of the NAACP across the nation, it is important
for Stanford to have its own chapter of this
prestigious organization.
Project $6,153
Motivation (UO $0.32)
12 3 4 5
Project Motivation works to expose at-risk
youth to the benefits of college by bringing
them to Stanford in an effort to put them on
the track to success. The group organizes
events like "A Day with an Undergrad," pro
vides information packets on applying to col
lege, and has even seen its own graduates go
on to attend Stanford. This 20-year-old pro
grain decreased its special lee request by 1 I
percent this year, spending their its efficiently
in addition to serving an important purpose
in a creative and committed way.
SCBN $19,195
(B $0.47)
12 3 4 5
The most impressive thing about this group is
the fact that they have managed to reduce this
year's special fee request by 14 percent. How
ever, the rest of their goals for next year seem
a bit hazy and unrealistic. The group is defi
nitely a plus for students as it provides the
campus with free cable, but the actual number
of people who choose to use this service is
unclear.
Stanford $30,251
American Indian (UO $1.57)
Organization
12 3 4 5
SAIO serves as the social, political and cultur
al center for the American Indian, Alaska
Native and Native Hawaiian communities at
Stanford. The group is responsible for the

Stanford Powwow, as well as a number of
other campus cultural events to reflect the
diverse traditions of Native American culture.
The group has demonstrated a clear sense of
its own constituency, but SAIO events do
reach the entire campus, not just the Ameri
can Indian population. SAIO is the primary
organization responsible for the Native Amer
ican community and is a valuable asset to a
culturally diverse Stanford campus.
Stanford Axe $ 10,185
Committee (UO $0.53)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Axe Committee was founded
to maintain the traditions of the University
and its Athletics Department. Its responsibil
ities include annual Big Came week activi
ties, the protection of the Axe when it is on
campus and the distribution of a handbook
for freshmen containing the history and tra
ditions of Stanford. The group has minimal
sources of funding and relies almost entirely
on its special fee to continue its operation.
Axe Coimn currently serves an important
112 unction but could make more of an effort to
be active outside of the football season.
Besides occasional attendance at some spoi l
ing events and the sponsoring of the I'risbee
golf tournament in the spring, the group is
not visible on campus after fall quarter. Axe
Comm needs to address the above issues
before it can become a wise investment for
the Stanford Community.
Stanford Band $59,980
(LSJUMB) (UO $3.11)
12 3 4 5
The LSJ I M B wears a number of hats — from
performing all-campus rallies to inspiring
sports teams at home and on the toad. Mem
bership in the Band is open to all students,
regardless of musical ability and Band events
serve the entire campus. Every time you've
run with the Band at midnight or jumped in
the middle of "All Right Now" at a spoi ling
event, you see your special lee dollars at work.
The Band is a vital part of Stanford spirit.
Stanford $20,060
Chamber Chorale (B $0.49)
12 3 4 5
T his group has taken on the loft\ goal of
improving Stanford's reputation in the arts
and lias clone an admirable job. All members
of the group must tryout again each year in a
sort of self-enforced re-evaluation process that
contributes to the strength of the group.
Approximately 'UiOO people attend their oil
campus performances each year, and the
group tours national!) and internationally on
an amazingly efficient budget. This group has
worked to increase its visibility on campus
and, in continuing ibis process, will do Stan
ford's music program a great service.
Stanford $ 17,700
Chaparral (UO $0.92)
12 3 4 5
Having just completed its 100 th year of publi
cation, the Stanford (lhaparral ( I lie Chappie)
is the campus' oldest humor publication.
Instantly recognizable with its door-to-door
delivery, The Chappie is known for its annual
Orientation issues and "fake Dailies" as well as
a number of othei publications throughout
the year. T he group lias asked for a nominal
increase in special lee and seeks to publish an
additional issue next year, making better use
of special fee funds. In addition, The Chappie
has greatly increased its advertising campaign,
drawing in new sources of revenue to sup
plant special fee funding.
Stanford Community $6,196
Carnival (UO $0.32)
12 3 4 5

Stanford Community Carnival brings 500 to
1000 elementary school children and their
families to Stanford every spring quarter to
enjoy a day of free, safe fun put on by Stan
lord undergraduates from all across cam
pus. Dorms sponsor booths at the Carnival,
as do many clubs, sports teams, and other
student organizations. This year, without
increasing its special fee request, the Carni
val is expanding to invite the children of
Stanford workers and faculty, as well as
those who have been invited in the past —
children from Kast Palo Alto, East Menlo
Park, and the surrounding community. The
Community Carnival brings together Stan
lord students from across years, majors and
interests, particularly through its appeal to
students who may not necessarily consider
themselves "activists," to reach underprivi
leged children and provide them, as well as
their families and Stanford stall and faculty
families, with meaningful connections to
Stanford.
Stanford Concerts 7 2 /670
Network (B $1.76)
12 3 4 5
Stanford Concert Network both organizes
and co-sponsors a variety of events through
out their year in an effort to provide quality
entertainment to Stanford students at little
or no cost. This year, the Concert Network
programs included the Coffee House series,
the Sir Mix-A-Lot show at the Mausoleum,
and the Roots show. They have a salaried
stall and have introduced an unpaid intern
ship program. The group plans to increase
its programming in the coining year, as well
as the caliber of the artists it brings to the
University, which, in part, is responsible for
the large increase in their special fee request
this year. The group reaches the entire cam
pus through its co-sponsorships of a wide
range of events with a diverse group of orga
nizations who could not produce their
events without the support of the Concert
Network.
Stanford Film $31,980
Society (UO $1.66)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Film Society is the only group
on campus devoted to the promotion of film
as an art, educational and entertainment
medium. Its free film screenings and assis
tance to undergraduates in the production of
films fills the void left by the lac k of an under
graduate film studies curriculum at Stanford.
1 hough the group has decreased its special
fee request this year, it could make more of an
attempt to seek outside sources of funding. It
could also better advertise its events to the
Stanford community in an effort to serve the
campus more effectively.
Stanford in $22,838
Government (UO$1.18)
12 3 4 5
/ v...-
Fhrough fellowships, speakers series, election
drives and other activities, Stanford in C.ov
ernment provides an invaluable political ser
\ ice to Stanford students. The group has clone
extensive outside fundraising and consistently
spends the majority of their special fee money
each year. This is the only non-partisan politi
cal group on campus, is efficiently run and
works to expand their programming each
year.
Stanford Jazz $20,130
Orchestra (UO $1.04)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Jazz Orchestra is the only stu
dent-run group focusing on jazz, and there
lore provides ;i potentially valuable service to
this campus. However, the organization's
biggest shortcoming is that its performances
do not drav\ much of a student audience. Fur
thermore, up till now, it has sought very little
outside funding and instead relies heavily on
special fees.

Stanford $15,195
Mock Trial (UO $0.79)
12 3 4 5
Stanlbrd Mock Trial aims to increase knowl
edge of the American legal system through
participation in events held by the American
Mock Trial Association. The groups has
increased its special fee request this year by
0.71 percent in order to decrease the amount
of money that each student must contribute in
order to attend the regional and national com
petitions that they have qualified for. Though
the group has done an excellent job of seeking
outside sources of funding and of efficiently
using their money, they only reach a very
small portion of the Stanford community.
They should make more of an attempt to
reach out to the Stanford community in the
future.
Stanford Project $4,531
On Nutrition (UO $0.24)
12 3 4 5
For 11 years SPOON has been collecting
unused food from campus residences for dis
tribution to area food pantries for the hungry.
SPOON is requesting a larger special fee, but
has planned some increases in programming
to necessitate this rise. They have a gocxl sense
of their constituency and have consistently
found outside sources of funding, the best
example of which is their efficient use of left
over campus food to alleviate hunger in the
communities surrounding Stanford.
Stanford Solar $31,202
Car Project (UO $1.62)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Solar Car Project comprises
graduate and undergraduate students with an
interest in engineering who design and build
a solar car which is then used in races and dis
played at events. Most of the group's funding
comes from outside donations of product
materials from companies, but given the
heavy cost of such a project the group should
do more to attract corporate monetary spon
sorship. Furthermore, as it is already limited
to a particular campus constituency, the
group needs to strengthen its campus out
reach efforts, so that more students are aware
of its presence.
Stanford's $24,098.80
Women (UO $1.25)
Coalition
12 3 4 5
The Women's Coalition is a strong umbrella
group that coordinates the needs and activi
ties of the various women's groups on campus.
The Coalition serves an important purpose, as
many of the groups under the Coalition could
not operate without spec ial fees and benefit by
having connections to other women's groups.
The Coalition also evaluates groups consis
tently, and has streamlined its budget this year
so that its special lee request is a decrease from
last year's.
Students for $9,085.76
Environmental (UO $0.47)
Action at Stanford
12 3 4 5
SFAS is an activist group working on environ
mental justice issues. This year, the group has
made efforts to educate the campus about local
environmental justice campaigns, in addition
to bringing speakers to campus and participat
ing in the annual Dis-Orientation Conference
in the fall. Although SEAS offers an important
space for student activists with broad interests,
the group could benefit the community more
by reaching out to the campus mainstream.
Without the support of SEAS, however, many
smaller environmental groups would not exist,
making its presence essential.

NEW GROUPS
ASSU Online $16,500
Course Guide (UO $0.86)
12 3 4 5
The ASSU Online Course Guide has under
gone a dramatic transformation over the last
three years, ending in its current iteration —
a site that includes all the information of both
the Time Schedule and the Bulletin in fully
searchable form. Although the site provides
an invaluable service from which many stu
dents would benefit greatly, it is woefully
underpublicized, making improved publicity
a top priority for this group next year.
Electrolytes $5,250
(UO $0.27)
12 3 4 5
The Electrolytes were formed recently to pro
mote Electronica music on campus in safe
environments that can act as alternatives to
raves. The group is still a new one and does
not yet have a strong sense of constituency —
most of its 50 to 60 members participate in the
group through an e-mail list. The Electrolytes
need to make stronger efforts in the coming
year to solidify its internal organization and, in
promoting their organization, the Electrolytes
should consider carefully how best to reach
the larger student community, specifically
those who would not regularly attend events
like those the Electrolytes sponsor.
Graduate Women's $14,340
Network (GO $0.65)
12 3 4 5
The Graduate Women's Network acts as an
academic, support, information and activities
network, formed and led by graduate women
of all disciplines. It seeks to bring graduate
women together in a supportive and collabo
rative environment to foster academic
achievement and personal wellness. It also
reaches out to the wives of graduate students
and to undergraduate women in the hopes of
providing a mentoring relationship. The
group did not apply for a special fee last year,
but it does receive outside sources of funding
in an attempt to reduce the amount it needs to
seek from special fees. Through multiple pro
grams held in the past two years, the Gradu
ate Women's Network has proven itself to be
deserving of a special fee.
Muslim Students $13,087
Awareness (UO $0.32)
Network
12 3 4 5
MSAN is a non-religious student organization
whose main goal is to bring more awareness to
campus about issues pertaining to the Muslim
world. All MSAN events are open to the pub
lic, drawing both undergraduates and gradu
ates as well as alumni and members of the
local community. MSAN has taken the initia
tive to seek out groups such as BSU and the
Jewish Studies Department to co-sponsor
many of their events, and they have consis
tently been able to raise awareness about
many controversial issues in an extremely
timely fashion.
Students $14,772.35
Organizing (UO $0.77)
Committee for the Arts
12 3 4 5
SOCA strives to fill the need for resources for
students who are interested in the arts but not
at the competitive level. This group was suc
cessful in organizing "An Art Affair," which
brought student performers and artists to cen
ter stage in White Plaza. This group serves an
important purpose of improving the percep
tion of the arts on campus.
In mi effort to mike informed special-fee
empmements, members vj The Daily's editorial
hbdrd spent numerous hours during the frfist two
weeks revieumg the budgets and ASSU Elections
Handbook statements submitted by student groups
requesting sperm I fees to the ASSU. The members
<>l the editorial board also met with representatives
of each oj the groups and asked them about the
group's goals, its accomplishments during the past
year, plans for expansion or improvement in the
towing academic year and how special-fee funds
would be spent.
liased on the submitted information and
intervieji' discussions, the board reached an
endorsement decision for each group based on a
majority vote within the board. The board has
tried to include as much information about each
group as possible in the explanation of its
endorsements. The Daily encourages all students
to obtain a co/ry of the ASSI! Elections Handbook
and read each group's statement and budget to
reach then own concliisums.
AS NOTED IN the evaluation criteria

ing during spring break. ASH definitively
serves a need I hat would otherwise go unmet
and would be missed should it not exist on
campus. The program needs its special fees
to continue operating and has made exten
sive efforts this past year to fundraise outside
of special fees. Since the program must limit
itself to a certain number of trips and stu
dents, ASH could increase its programming
in the spring quarter, such as holding
forums or dorm talks, so that participants
and leaders can share their service experi
ences with other students.

Asian American $28,569
Students (UO $ 1.48)
Association
12 3 4 5
AASA is an umbrella organization that pro
vides resources and support for 10 Asian-
American student groups. Its three-pronged
focus, on social, cultural and political issues, is
a well-executed one, making it a group that
would definitely be missed if it didn't exist.
AASA also makes an admirable effort to
fundraise and bring in money for its groups
outside of the monies it receives from special
fees, and it could focus on this more for the
upcoming year. AASA's programming is slay
ing balanced next year and will not increase to
any great extent, in conjunction with only a
I.() percent increase in special fee requests
from last year.
ASSU $89,770
Legal Counseling (B $2.18)
12 3 4 5
The ASSU Legal Counseling Office has pro
vided free legal advice to Stanford students
for many years. Although the LCO cannot
represent students in court, their staff attor
neys focus on "preventative law" and will
answer questions about parking tickets,
bankruptcy, and divorce, among other
issues. This past year, the LCO advised
about 700 graduate students and 400 under
graduates. Although their special fee request
is large, the service they provide is a huge
asset to the student body. However, it is
important that the LCO increase its publici
ty efforts dramatically since many students
are completely unaware that this invaluable
service even exists.
ASSU $121,901
Speakers Bureau (B $2.93)
12 3 4 5
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a student-run
organization that brings well-known speak
ers to campus, organizes debates and panel
discussions on current events and co-spon
sors other student groups' speaking events
and discussions. The group increased their
budget by 3.1 percent in order to increase
the amount of money they have available to
advertise their events and to have more
money available to attract world-renowned
speakers to campus. Fart of the ASSU Speak
ers Bureau special fee is used to pay the
salaries of its two officers. Providing free lec

tures by famous figures and assisting other
groups in doing the same makes the ASSU
Speakers Bureau a valuable organization on
campus whose presence would be missed.
Barrio $21,299.84
Assistance (UO $1.11)
12 3 4 5
This group has tutored school-age children
for 28 years, and they have a lot to show for
it, having used that time to build a presti
gious and effective program for area youth
who would have no exposure to a university
like Stanford otherwise. Their budget is
meticulously and efficiently organized and
they work very hard to establish outside
funding. They provide a strong link between
children in East Palo Alto and Stanford stu
dents. Barrio Assistance, in providing a stim
ulating experience of Stanford for young
children who return year after year, is truly
an invaluable asset to the community.
Black $27,270
Student Union (UO $1.41)
12 3 4 5
l he Black Student Union, a vital part of the
African-American community at Stanford, has
demonstrated a clear sense of purpose and
constituency as well as a broad range of pro
gramming designed to benefit not only the
Stanford community, but also, local areas.
Special fees provide funding for events such as
the Kwanzaa celebration, a welcome reception
for black freshmen during orientation, the
Soul Food Dinner and the BSU's high school
conference which is an important outreach
into Bay Area communities. In addition, the
BSU cosponsors many events with other cam
pus organizations such as the Kevin Powell
lecture this year, and the group plans to lix us
on attracting a prominent speaker to campus
in the coming year.
Club Sports $154,440
(B $3.75)
12 3 4 5
The Club Sports special fee provides fund
ing for the 18 Club Sports teams ranging
from squash to mountain hiking. These
teams receive little funding from the Athlet
ic Department, and the special fee is used to
cover the costs of equipment, travel and
other expenses. Stanford's Club Sports
teams enjoy unparalleled success around the

country with teams such as women's rugby
and women's ultimate Frisbee capturing
national titles last year. The special lee is cru
cial to the continuation oi" the hugely suc
cessful Club Sports program.
International $9,791.30
Undergraduate (UO $0.51)
Community
12 3 4 5
As the only on-campus group serving Stan
lord's population of international students
through events such as International Stu
dent Orientation, dinners, workshops and
cultural activities, lUC 112 ulfills a vital function
that would otherwise go unmet. However,
despite this apparent focus on international
students, the organization is open to every
one and attempts to reach out to students
from all backgrounds in its programming.
Moreover, this year's special fee request rep
resents only a small request increase from
last year's fee.
Kids with $9,134.39
Dreams (UO $0.47)
12 3 4 5
Kids with Dreams is a community service
organization whose primary goal in previous
years has been outreach to developmentally
handicapped children in the Bay Area. In the
last year, this organization has been successful
in also hosting a large, extremely successful,
and very well-organized conference introduc
ing the idea of "social entrepreneurship,"
demonstrating the group's commitment to the
campus community at large. Along with a
decrease in this year's special fee request, their
budgets reflect an efficient use of funding, and
they have been diligent in seeking alternate
sources of funding.
KZSU $84,944
(UO $2.06)
12 3 4 5
As a student-run radio station featuring sev
eral types of programming, including news,
sporting events, and music, KZSU provides
a valuable service to the campus. However,
the station could be more active in its overall
publicity efforts to make others more aware
of its presence. Furthermore, the organiza
tion has run into some problems with debt in
recent years that it must attempt to rectify
immediately.

MEChA $34,911
(UO $1.81)
12 3 4 5
MEChA is a well-organized, strong group that
provides programming focused on addressing
the needs of Chicano/a and Latino/a students
on campus, as well as bringing the culture to
the greater Stanford community. MEChA
does very well in fundraising and is active in
the community, providing students with the
chance to be involved in activism surrounding
issues ranging from Webb Ranch to the
grapes boycott. The group holds a variety of
different programs dining the year, from
Caesar Chavez Commemoration Week to Dia
de los Muertos, and it serves an important role
in the community.
Mind's Eye $13,146
(UO $0.68)
12 3 4 5
1 he Mind's Eye publishes two issues a year of
student photography, poetry, short stories,
and painting. As the only literary magazine on
campus, the Mind's Eye serves an important
need that would otherwise go unmet. While
these students strive to produce a high-quality
journal of expression, a much larger effort at
publicity is necessary for this group to serve
the larger campus most effectively.
NAACP $15,395
(UO $0.80)
12 3 4 5
Requesting a special fee for the second year, the
Stanford chapter of the NAACP has done a
good job of re-organizing its budget to address
problems noted in its first year of using special
fees with only a modest increase in its special lee
request. The group has a strong sense of its
constituency, serving it in many ways, including
through the co-sponsorship of events with
other organizations. In addition, given the role
of the NAACP across the nation, it is important
for Stanford to have its own chapter of this
prestigious organization.
Project $6,153
Motivation (UO $0.32)
12 3 4 5
Project Motivation works to expose at-risk
youth to the benefits of college by bringing
them to Stanford in an effort to put them on
the track to success. The group organizes
events like "A Day with an Undergrad," pro
vides information packets on applying to col
lege, and has even seen its own graduates go
on to attend Stanford. This 20-year-old pro
grain decreased its special lee request by 1 I
percent this year, spending their its efficiently
in addition to serving an important purpose
in a creative and committed way.
SCBN $19,195
(B $0.47)
12 3 4 5
The most impressive thing about this group is
the fact that they have managed to reduce this
year's special fee request by 14 percent. How
ever, the rest of their goals for next year seem
a bit hazy and unrealistic. The group is defi
nitely a plus for students as it provides the
campus with free cable, but the actual number
of people who choose to use this service is
unclear.
Stanford $30,251
American Indian (UO $1.57)
Organization
12 3 4 5
SAIO serves as the social, political and cultur
al center for the American Indian, Alaska
Native and Native Hawaiian communities at
Stanford. The group is responsible for the

Stanford Powwow, as well as a number of
other campus cultural events to reflect the
diverse traditions of Native American culture.
The group has demonstrated a clear sense of
its own constituency, but SAIO events do
reach the entire campus, not just the Ameri
can Indian population. SAIO is the primary
organization responsible for the Native Amer
ican community and is a valuable asset to a
culturally diverse Stanford campus.
Stanford Axe $ 10,185
Committee (UO $0.53)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Axe Committee was founded
to maintain the traditions of the University
and its Athletics Department. Its responsibil
ities include annual Big Came week activi
ties, the protection of the Axe when it is on
campus and the distribution of a handbook
for freshmen containing the history and tra
ditions of Stanford. The group has minimal
sources of funding and relies almost entirely
on its special fee to continue its operation.
Axe Coimn currently serves an important
112 unction but could make more of an effort to
be active outside of the football season.
Besides occasional attendance at some spoi l
ing events and the sponsoring of the I'risbee
golf tournament in the spring, the group is
not visible on campus after fall quarter. Axe
Comm needs to address the above issues
before it can become a wise investment for
the Stanford Community.
Stanford Band $59,980
(LSJUMB) (UO $3.11)
12 3 4 5
The LSJ I M B wears a number of hats — from
performing all-campus rallies to inspiring
sports teams at home and on the toad. Mem
bership in the Band is open to all students,
regardless of musical ability and Band events
serve the entire campus. Every time you've
run with the Band at midnight or jumped in
the middle of "All Right Now" at a spoi ling
event, you see your special lee dollars at work.
The Band is a vital part of Stanford spirit.
Stanford $20,060
Chamber Chorale (B $0.49)
12 3 4 5
T his group has taken on the loft\ goal of
improving Stanford's reputation in the arts
and lias clone an admirable job. All members
of the group must tryout again each year in a
sort of self-enforced re-evaluation process that
contributes to the strength of the group.
Approximately 'UiOO people attend their oil
campus performances each year, and the
group tours national!) and internationally on
an amazingly efficient budget. This group has
worked to increase its visibility on campus
and, in continuing ibis process, will do Stan
ford's music program a great service.
Stanford $ 17,700
Chaparral (UO $0.92)
12 3 4 5
Having just completed its 100 th year of publi
cation, the Stanford (lhaparral ( I lie Chappie)
is the campus' oldest humor publication.
Instantly recognizable with its door-to-door
delivery, The Chappie is known for its annual
Orientation issues and "fake Dailies" as well as
a number of othei publications throughout
the year. T he group lias asked for a nominal
increase in special lee and seeks to publish an
additional issue next year, making better use
of special fee funds. In addition, The Chappie
has greatly increased its advertising campaign,
drawing in new sources of revenue to sup
plant special fee funding.
Stanford Community $6,196
Carnival (UO $0.32)
12 3 4 5

Stanford Community Carnival brings 500 to
1000 elementary school children and their
families to Stanford every spring quarter to
enjoy a day of free, safe fun put on by Stan
lord undergraduates from all across cam
pus. Dorms sponsor booths at the Carnival,
as do many clubs, sports teams, and other
student organizations. This year, without
increasing its special fee request, the Carni
val is expanding to invite the children of
Stanford workers and faculty, as well as
those who have been invited in the past —
children from Kast Palo Alto, East Menlo
Park, and the surrounding community. The
Community Carnival brings together Stan
lord students from across years, majors and
interests, particularly through its appeal to
students who may not necessarily consider
themselves "activists," to reach underprivi
leged children and provide them, as well as
their families and Stanford stall and faculty
families, with meaningful connections to
Stanford.
Stanford Concerts 7 2 /670
Network (B $1.76)
12 3 4 5
Stanford Concert Network both organizes
and co-sponsors a variety of events through
out their year in an effort to provide quality
entertainment to Stanford students at little
or no cost. This year, the Concert Network
programs included the Coffee House series,
the Sir Mix-A-Lot show at the Mausoleum,
and the Roots show. They have a salaried
stall and have introduced an unpaid intern
ship program. The group plans to increase
its programming in the coining year, as well
as the caliber of the artists it brings to the
University, which, in part, is responsible for
the large increase in their special fee request
this year. The group reaches the entire cam
pus through its co-sponsorships of a wide
range of events with a diverse group of orga
nizations who could not produce their
events without the support of the Concert
Network.
Stanford Film $31,980
Society (UO $1.66)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Film Society is the only group
on campus devoted to the promotion of film
as an art, educational and entertainment
medium. Its free film screenings and assis
tance to undergraduates in the production of
films fills the void left by the lac k of an under
graduate film studies curriculum at Stanford.
1 hough the group has decreased its special
fee request this year, it could make more of an
attempt to seek outside sources of funding. It
could also better advertise its events to the
Stanford community in an effort to serve the
campus more effectively.
Stanford in $22,838
Government (UO$1.18)
12 3 4 5
/ v...-
Fhrough fellowships, speakers series, election
drives and other activities, Stanford in C.ov
ernment provides an invaluable political ser
\ ice to Stanford students. The group has clone
extensive outside fundraising and consistently
spends the majority of their special fee money
each year. This is the only non-partisan politi
cal group on campus, is efficiently run and
works to expand their programming each
year.
Stanford Jazz $20,130
Orchestra (UO $1.04)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Jazz Orchestra is the only stu
dent-run group focusing on jazz, and there
lore provides ;i potentially valuable service to
this campus. However, the organization's
biggest shortcoming is that its performances
do not drav\ much of a student audience. Fur
thermore, up till now, it has sought very little
outside funding and instead relies heavily on
special fees.

Stanford $15,195
Mock Trial (UO $0.79)
12 3 4 5
Stanlbrd Mock Trial aims to increase knowl
edge of the American legal system through
participation in events held by the American
Mock Trial Association. The groups has
increased its special fee request this year by
0.71 percent in order to decrease the amount
of money that each student must contribute in
order to attend the regional and national com
petitions that they have qualified for. Though
the group has done an excellent job of seeking
outside sources of funding and of efficiently
using their money, they only reach a very
small portion of the Stanford community.
They should make more of an attempt to
reach out to the Stanford community in the
future.
Stanford Project $4,531
On Nutrition (UO $0.24)
12 3 4 5
For 11 years SPOON has been collecting
unused food from campus residences for dis
tribution to area food pantries for the hungry.
SPOON is requesting a larger special fee, but
has planned some increases in programming
to necessitate this rise. They have a gocxl sense
of their constituency and have consistently
found outside sources of funding, the best
example of which is their efficient use of left
over campus food to alleviate hunger in the
communities surrounding Stanford.
Stanford Solar $31,202
Car Project (UO $1.62)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Solar Car Project comprises
graduate and undergraduate students with an
interest in engineering who design and build
a solar car which is then used in races and dis
played at events. Most of the group's funding
comes from outside donations of product
materials from companies, but given the
heavy cost of such a project the group should
do more to attract corporate monetary spon
sorship. Furthermore, as it is already limited
to a particular campus constituency, the
group needs to strengthen its campus out
reach efforts, so that more students are aware
of its presence.
Stanford's $24,098.80
Women (UO $1.25)
Coalition
12 3 4 5
The Women's Coalition is a strong umbrella
group that coordinates the needs and activi
ties of the various women's groups on campus.
The Coalition serves an important purpose, as
many of the groups under the Coalition could
not operate without spec ial fees and benefit by
having connections to other women's groups.
The Coalition also evaluates groups consis
tently, and has streamlined its budget this year
so that its special lee request is a decrease from
last year's.
Students for $9,085.76
Environmental (UO $0.47)
Action at Stanford
12 3 4 5
SFAS is an activist group working on environ
mental justice issues. This year, the group has
made efforts to educate the campus about local
environmental justice campaigns, in addition
to bringing speakers to campus and participat
ing in the annual Dis-Orientation Conference
in the fall. Although SEAS offers an important
space for student activists with broad interests,
the group could benefit the community more
by reaching out to the campus mainstream.
Without the support of SEAS, however, many
smaller environmental groups would not exist,
making its presence essential.

NEW GROUPS
ASSU Online $16,500
Course Guide (UO $0.86)
12 3 4 5
The ASSU Online Course Guide has under
gone a dramatic transformation over the last
three years, ending in its current iteration —
a site that includes all the information of both
the Time Schedule and the Bulletin in fully
searchable form. Although the site provides
an invaluable service from which many stu
dents would benefit greatly, it is woefully
underpublicized, making improved publicity
a top priority for this group next year.
Electrolytes $5,250
(UO $0.27)
12 3 4 5
The Electrolytes were formed recently to pro
mote Electronica music on campus in safe
environments that can act as alternatives to
raves. The group is still a new one and does
not yet have a strong sense of constituency —
most of its 50 to 60 members participate in the
group through an e-mail list. The Electrolytes
need to make stronger efforts in the coming
year to solidify its internal organization and, in
promoting their organization, the Electrolytes
should consider carefully how best to reach
the larger student community, specifically
those who would not regularly attend events
like those the Electrolytes sponsor.
Graduate Women's $14,340
Network (GO $0.65)
12 3 4 5
The Graduate Women's Network acts as an
academic, support, information and activities
network, formed and led by graduate women
of all disciplines. It seeks to bring graduate
women together in a supportive and collabo
rative environment to foster academic
achievement and personal wellness. It also
reaches out to the wives of graduate students
and to undergraduate women in the hopes of
providing a mentoring relationship. The
group did not apply for a special fee last year,
but it does receive outside sources of funding
in an attempt to reduce the amount it needs to
seek from special fees. Through multiple pro
grams held in the past two years, the Gradu
ate Women's Network has proven itself to be
deserving of a special fee.
Muslim Students $13,087
Awareness (UO $0.32)
Network
12 3 4 5
MSAN is a non-religious student organization
whose main goal is to bring more awareness to
campus about issues pertaining to the Muslim
world. All MSAN events are open to the pub
lic, drawing both undergraduates and gradu
ates as well as alumni and members of the
local community. MSAN has taken the initia
tive to seek out groups such as BSU and the
Jewish Studies Department to co-sponsor
many of their events, and they have consis
tently been able to raise awareness about
many controversial issues in an extremely
timely fashion.
Students $14,772.35
Organizing (UO $0.77)
Committee for the Arts
12 3 4 5
SOCA strives to fill the need for resources for
students who are interested in the arts but not
at the competitive level. This group was suc
cessful in organizing "An Art Affair," which
brought student performers and artists to cen
ter stage in White Plaza. This group serves an
important purpose of improving the percep
tion of the arts on campus.
In mi effort to mike informed special-fee
empmements, members vj The Daily's editorial
hbdrd spent numerous hours during the frfist two
weeks revieumg the budgets and ASSU Elections
Handbook statements submitted by student groups
requesting sperm I fees to the ASSU. The members
<>l the editorial board also met with representatives
of each oj the groups and asked them about the
group's goals, its accomplishments during the past
year, plans for expansion or improvement in the
towing academic year and how special-fee funds
would be spent.
liased on the submitted information and
intervieji' discussions, the board reached an
endorsement decision for each group based on a
majority vote within the board. The board has
tried to include as much information about each
group as possible in the explanation of its
endorsements. The Daily encourages all students
to obtain a co/ry of the ASSI! Elections Handbook
and read each group's statement and budget to
reach then own concliisums.
AS NOTED IN the evaluation criteria

ing during spring break. ASH definitively
serves a need I hat would otherwise go unmet
and would be missed should it not exist on
campus. The program needs its special fees
to continue operating and has made exten
sive efforts this past year to fundraise outside
of special fees. Since the program must limit
itself to a certain number of trips and stu
dents, ASH could increase its programming
in the spring quarter, such as holding
forums or dorm talks, so that participants
and leaders can share their service experi
ences with other students.

Asian American $28,569
Students (UO $ 1.48)
Association
12 3 4 5
AASA is an umbrella organization that pro
vides resources and support for 10 Asian-
American student groups. Its three-pronged
focus, on social, cultural and political issues, is
a well-executed one, making it a group that
would definitely be missed if it didn't exist.
AASA also makes an admirable effort to
fundraise and bring in money for its groups
outside of the monies it receives from special
fees, and it could focus on this more for the
upcoming year. AASA's programming is slay
ing balanced next year and will not increase to
any great extent, in conjunction with only a
I.() percent increase in special fee requests
from last year.
ASSU $89,770
Legal Counseling (B $2.18)
12 3 4 5
The ASSU Legal Counseling Office has pro
vided free legal advice to Stanford students
for many years. Although the LCO cannot
represent students in court, their staff attor
neys focus on "preventative law" and will
answer questions about parking tickets,
bankruptcy, and divorce, among other
issues. This past year, the LCO advised
about 700 graduate students and 400 under
graduates. Although their special fee request
is large, the service they provide is a huge
asset to the student body. However, it is
important that the LCO increase its publici
ty efforts dramatically since many students
are completely unaware that this invaluable
service even exists.
ASSU $121,901
Speakers Bureau (B $2.93)
12 3 4 5
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a student-run
organization that brings well-known speak
ers to campus, organizes debates and panel
discussions on current events and co-spon
sors other student groups' speaking events
and discussions. The group increased their
budget by 3.1 percent in order to increase
the amount of money they have available to
advertise their events and to have more
money available to attract world-renowned
speakers to campus. Fart of the ASSU Speak
ers Bureau special fee is used to pay the
salaries of its two officers. Providing free lec

tures by famous figures and assisting other
groups in doing the same makes the ASSU
Speakers Bureau a valuable organization on
campus whose presence would be missed.
Barrio $21,299.84
Assistance (UO $1.11)
12 3 4 5
This group has tutored school-age children
for 28 years, and they have a lot to show for
it, having used that time to build a presti
gious and effective program for area youth
who would have no exposure to a university
like Stanford otherwise. Their budget is
meticulously and efficiently organized and
they work very hard to establish outside
funding. They provide a strong link between
children in East Palo Alto and Stanford stu
dents. Barrio Assistance, in providing a stim
ulating experience of Stanford for young
children who return year after year, is truly
an invaluable asset to the community.
Black $27,270
Student Union (UO $1.41)
12 3 4 5
l he Black Student Union, a vital part of the
African-American community at Stanford, has
demonstrated a clear sense of purpose and
constituency as well as a broad range of pro
gramming designed to benefit not only the
Stanford community, but also, local areas.
Special fees provide funding for events such as
the Kwanzaa celebration, a welcome reception
for black freshmen during orientation, the
Soul Food Dinner and the BSU's high school
conference which is an important outreach
into Bay Area communities. In addition, the
BSU cosponsors many events with other cam
pus organizations such as the Kevin Powell
lecture this year, and the group plans to lix us
on attracting a prominent speaker to campus
in the coming year.
Club Sports $154,440
(B $3.75)
12 3 4 5
The Club Sports special fee provides fund
ing for the 18 Club Sports teams ranging
from squash to mountain hiking. These
teams receive little funding from the Athlet
ic Department, and the special fee is used to
cover the costs of equipment, travel and
other expenses. Stanford's Club Sports
teams enjoy unparalleled success around the

country with teams such as women's rugby
and women's ultimate Frisbee capturing
national titles last year. The special lee is cru
cial to the continuation oi" the hugely suc
cessful Club Sports program.
International $9,791.30
Undergraduate (UO $0.51)
Community
12 3 4 5
As the only on-campus group serving Stan
lord's population of international students
through events such as International Stu
dent Orientation, dinners, workshops and
cultural activities, lUC 112 ulfills a vital function
that would otherwise go unmet. However,
despite this apparent focus on international
students, the organization is open to every
one and attempts to reach out to students
from all backgrounds in its programming.
Moreover, this year's special fee request rep
resents only a small request increase from
last year's fee.
Kids with $9,134.39
Dreams (UO $0.47)
12 3 4 5
Kids with Dreams is a community service
organization whose primary goal in previous
years has been outreach to developmentally
handicapped children in the Bay Area. In the
last year, this organization has been successful
in also hosting a large, extremely successful,
and very well-organized conference introduc
ing the idea of "social entrepreneurship,"
demonstrating the group's commitment to the
campus community at large. Along with a
decrease in this year's special fee request, their
budgets reflect an efficient use of funding, and
they have been diligent in seeking alternate
sources of funding.
KZSU $84,944
(UO $2.06)
12 3 4 5
As a student-run radio station featuring sev
eral types of programming, including news,
sporting events, and music, KZSU provides
a valuable service to the campus. However,
the station could be more active in its overall
publicity efforts to make others more aware
of its presence. Furthermore, the organiza
tion has run into some problems with debt in
recent years that it must attempt to rectify
immediately.

MEChA $34,911
(UO $1.81)
12 3 4 5
MEChA is a well-organized, strong group that
provides programming focused on addressing
the needs of Chicano/a and Latino/a students
on campus, as well as bringing the culture to
the greater Stanford community. MEChA
does very well in fundraising and is active in
the community, providing students with the
chance to be involved in activism surrounding
issues ranging from Webb Ranch to the
grapes boycott. The group holds a variety of
different programs dining the year, from
Caesar Chavez Commemoration Week to Dia
de los Muertos, and it serves an important role
in the community.
Mind's Eye $13,146
(UO $0.68)
12 3 4 5
1 he Mind's Eye publishes two issues a year of
student photography, poetry, short stories,
and painting. As the only literary magazine on
campus, the Mind's Eye serves an important
need that would otherwise go unmet. While
these students strive to produce a high-quality
journal of expression, a much larger effort at
publicity is necessary for this group to serve
the larger campus most effectively.
NAACP $15,395
(UO $0.80)
12 3 4 5
Requesting a special fee for the second year, the
Stanford chapter of the NAACP has done a
good job of re-organizing its budget to address
problems noted in its first year of using special
fees with only a modest increase in its special lee
request. The group has a strong sense of its
constituency, serving it in many ways, including
through the co-sponsorship of events with
other organizations. In addition, given the role
of the NAACP across the nation, it is important
for Stanford to have its own chapter of this
prestigious organization.
Project $6,153
Motivation (UO $0.32)
12 3 4 5
Project Motivation works to expose at-risk
youth to the benefits of college by bringing
them to Stanford in an effort to put them on
the track to success. The group organizes
events like "A Day with an Undergrad," pro
vides information packets on applying to col
lege, and has even seen its own graduates go
on to attend Stanford. This 20-year-old pro
grain decreased its special lee request by 1 I
percent this year, spending their its efficiently
in addition to serving an important purpose
in a creative and committed way.
SCBN $19,195
(B $0.47)
12 3 4 5
The most impressive thing about this group is
the fact that they have managed to reduce this
year's special fee request by 14 percent. How
ever, the rest of their goals for next year seem
a bit hazy and unrealistic. The group is defi
nitely a plus for students as it provides the
campus with free cable, but the actual number
of people who choose to use this service is
unclear.
Stanford $30,251
American Indian (UO $1.57)
Organization
12 3 4 5
SAIO serves as the social, political and cultur
al center for the American Indian, Alaska
Native and Native Hawaiian communities at
Stanford. The group is responsible for the

Stanford Powwow, as well as a number of
other campus cultural events to reflect the
diverse traditions of Native American culture.
The group has demonstrated a clear sense of
its own constituency, but SAIO events do
reach the entire campus, not just the Ameri
can Indian population. SAIO is the primary
organization responsible for the Native Amer
ican community and is a valuable asset to a
culturally diverse Stanford campus.
Stanford Axe $ 10,185
Committee (UO $0.53)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Axe Committee was founded
to maintain the traditions of the University
and its Athletics Department. Its responsibil
ities include annual Big Came week activi
ties, the protection of the Axe when it is on
campus and the distribution of a handbook
for freshmen containing the history and tra
ditions of Stanford. The group has minimal
sources of funding and relies almost entirely
on its special fee to continue its operation.
Axe Coimn currently serves an important
112 unction but could make more of an effort to
be active outside of the football season.
Besides occasional attendance at some spoi l
ing events and the sponsoring of the I'risbee
golf tournament in the spring, the group is
not visible on campus after fall quarter. Axe
Comm needs to address the above issues
before it can become a wise investment for
the Stanford Community.
Stanford Band $59,980
(LSJUMB) (UO $3.11)
12 3 4 5
The LSJ I M B wears a number of hats — from
performing all-campus rallies to inspiring
sports teams at home and on the toad. Mem
bership in the Band is open to all students,
regardless of musical ability and Band events
serve the entire campus. Every time you've
run with the Band at midnight or jumped in
the middle of "All Right Now" at a spoi ling
event, you see your special lee dollars at work.
The Band is a vital part of Stanford spirit.

12 3 4 5
T his group has taken on the loft\ goal of
improving Stanford's reputation in the arts
and lias clone an admirable job. All members
of the group must tryout again each year in a
sort of self-enforced re-evaluation process that
contributes to the strength of the group.
Approximately 'UiOO people attend their oil
campus performances each year, and the
group tours national!) and internationally on
an amazingly efficient budget. This group has
worked to increase its visibility on campus
and, in continuing ibis process, will do Stan
ford's music program a great service.

Chaparral (UO $0.92)
12 3 4 5
Having just completed its 100 th year of publi
cation, the Stanford (lhaparral ( I lie Chappie)
is the campus' oldest humor publication.
Instantly recognizable with its door-to-door
delivery, The Chappie is known for its annual
Orientation issues and "fake Dailies" as well as
a number of othei publications throughout
the year. T he group lias asked for a nominal
increase in special lee and seeks to publish an
additional issue next year, making better use
of special fee funds. In addition, The Chappie
has greatly increased its advertising campaign,
drawing in new sources of revenue to sup
plant special fee funding.
Stanford Community $6,196
Carnival (UO $0.32)
12 3 4 5

Stanford Community Carnival brings 500 to
1000 elementary school children and their
families to Stanford every spring quarter to
enjoy a day of free, safe fun put on by Stan
lord undergraduates from all across cam
pus. Dorms sponsor booths at the Carnival,
as do many clubs, sports teams, and other
student organizations. This year, without
increasing its special fee request, the Carni
val is expanding to invite the children of
Stanford workers and faculty, as well as
those who have been invited in the past —
children from Kast Palo Alto, East Menlo
Park, and the surrounding community. The
Community Carnival brings together Stan
lord students from across years, majors and
interests, particularly through its appeal to
students who may not necessarily consider
themselves "activists," to reach underprivi
leged children and provide them, as well as
their families and Stanford stall and faculty
families, with meaningful connections to
Stanford.

programs included the Coffee House series,
the Sir Mix-A-Lot show at the Mausoleum,
and the Roots show. They have a salaried
stall and have introduced an unpaid intern
ship program. The group plans to increase
its programming in the coining year, as well
as the caliber of the artists it brings to the
University, which, in part, is responsible for
the large increase in their special fee request
this year. The group reaches the entire cam
pus through its co-sponsorships of a wide
range of events with a diverse group of orga
nizations who could not produce their
events without the support of the Concert
Network.
Stanford Film $31,980
Society (UO $1.66)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Film Society is the only group
on campus devoted to the promotion of film
as an art, educational and entertainment
medium. Its free film screenings and assis
tance to undergraduates in the production of
films fills the void left by the lac k of an under
graduate film studies curriculum at Stanford.
1 hough the group has decreased its special
fee request this year, it could make more of an
attempt to seek outside sources of funding. It
could also better advertise its events to the
Stanford community in an effort to serve the
campus more effectively.
Stanford in $22,838
Government (UO$1.18)
12 3 4 5
/ v...-
Fhrough fellowships, speakers series, election
drives and other activities, Stanford in C.ov
ernment provides an invaluable political ser
\ ice to Stanford students. The group has clone
extensive outside fundraising and consistently
spends the majority of their special fee money
each year. This is the only non-partisan politi
cal group on campus, is efficiently run and
works to expand their programming each
year.
Stanford Jazz $20,130
Orchestra (UO $1.04)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Jazz Orchestra is the only stu
dent-run group focusing on jazz, and there
lore provides ;i potentially valuable service to
this campus. However, the organization's
biggest shortcoming is that its performances
do not drav\ much of a student audience. Fur
thermore, up till now, it has sought very little
outside funding and instead relies heavily on
special fees.

Stanford $15,195
Mock Trial (UO $0.79)
12 3 4 5
Stanlbrd Mock Trial aims to increase knowl
edge of the American legal system through
participation in events held by the American
Mock Trial Association. The groups has
increased its special fee request this year by
0.71 percent in order to decrease the amount
of money that each student must contribute in
order to attend the regional and national com
petitions that they have qualified for. Though
the group has done an excellent job of seeking
outside sources of funding and of efficiently
using their money, they only reach a very
small portion of the Stanford community.
They should make more of an attempt to
reach out to the Stanford community in the
future.
Stanford Project $4,531
On Nutrition (UO $0.24)
12 3 4 5
For 11 years SPOON has been collecting
unused food from campus residences for dis
tribution to area food pantries for the hungry.
SPOON is requesting a larger special fee, but
has planned some increases in programming
to necessitate this rise. They have a gocxl sense
of their constituency and have consistently
found outside sources of funding, the best
example of which is their efficient use of left
over campus food to alleviate hunger in the
communities surrounding Stanford.
Stanford Solar $31,202
Car Project (UO $1.62)
12 3 4 5
The Stanford Solar Car Project comprises
graduate and undergraduate students with an
interest in engineering who design and build
a solar car which is then used in races and dis
played at events. Most of the group's funding
comes from outside donations of product
materials from companies, but given the
heavy cost of such a project the group should
do more to attract corporate monetary spon
sorship. Furthermore, as it is already limited
to a particular campus constituency, the
group needs to strengthen its campus out
reach efforts, so that more students are aware
of its presence.
Stanford's $24,098.80
Women (UO $1.25)
Coalition
12 3 4 5
The Women's Coalition is a strong umbrella
group that coordinates the needs and activi
ties of the various women's groups on campus.
The Coalition serves an important purpose, as
many of the groups under the Coalition could
not operate without spec ial fees and benefit by
having connections to other women's groups.
The Coalition also evaluates groups consis
tently, and has streamlined its budget this year
so that its special lee request is a decrease from
last year's.
Students for $9,085.76
Environmental (UO $0.47)
Action at Stanford
12 3 4 5
SFAS is an activist group working on environ
mental justice issues. This year, the group has
made efforts to educate the campus about local
environmental justice campaigns, in addition
to bringing speakers to campus and participat
ing in the annual Dis-Orientation Conference
in the fall. Although SEAS offers an important
space for student activists with broad interests,
the group could benefit the community more
by reaching out to the campus mainstream.
Without the support of SEAS, however, many
smaller environmental groups would not exist,
making its presence essential.

NEW GROUPS
ASSU Online $16,500
Course Guide (UO $0.86)
12 3 4 5
The ASSU Online Course Guide has under
gone a dramatic transformation over the last
three years, ending in its current iteration —
a site that includes all the information of both
the Time Schedule and the Bulletin in fully
searchable form. Although the site provides
an invaluable service from which many stu
dents would benefit greatly, it is woefully
underpublicized, making improved publicity
a top priority for this group next year.
Electrolytes $5,250
(UO $0.27)
12 3 4 5
The Electrolytes were formed recently to pro
mote Electronica music on campus in safe
environments that can act as alternatives to
raves. The group is still a new one and does
not yet have a strong sense of constituency —
most of its 50 to 60 members participate in the
group through an e-mail list. The Electrolytes
need to make stronger efforts in the coming
year to solidify its internal organization and, in
promoting their organization, the Electrolytes
should consider carefully how best to reach
the larger student community, specifically
those who would not regularly attend events
like those the Electrolytes sponsor.
Graduate Women's $14,340
Network (GO $0.65)
12 3 4 5
The Graduate Women's Network acts as an
academic, support, information and activities
network, formed and led by graduate women
of all disciplines. It seeks to bring graduate
women together in a supportive and collabo
rative environment to foster academic
achievement and personal wellness. It also
reaches out to the wives of graduate students
and to undergraduate women in the hopes of
providing a mentoring relationship. The
group did not apply for a special fee last year,
but it does receive outside sources of funding
in an attempt to reduce the amount it needs to
seek from special fees. Through multiple pro
grams held in the past two years, the Gradu
ate Women's Network has proven itself to be
deserving of a special fee.
Muslim Students $13,087
Awareness (UO $0.32)
Network
12 3 4 5
MSAN is a non-religious student organization
whose main goal is to bring more awareness to
campus about issues pertaining to the Muslim
world. All MSAN events are open to the pub
lic, drawing both undergraduates and gradu
ates as well as alumni and members of the
local community. MSAN has taken the initia
tive to seek out groups such as BSU and the
Jewish Studies Department to co-sponsor
many of their events, and they have consis
tently been able to raise awareness about
many controversial issues in an extremely
timely fashion.
Students $14,772.35
Organizing (UO $0.77)
Committee for the Arts
12 3 4 5
SOCA strives to fill the need for resources for
students who are interested in the arts but not
at the competitive level. This group was suc
cessful in organizing "An Art Affair," which
brought student performers and artists to cen
ter stage in White Plaza. This group serves an
important purpose of improving the percep
tion of the arts on campus.
