# Special Fee Endorsements
## 
### 
In mi effort to mike informed special-fee
empmements, members vj The Daily's editorial
hbdrd spent numerous hours during the frfist two
weeks revieumg the budgets and ASSU Elections
Handbook statements submitted by student groups
requesting sperm I fees to the ASSU. The members
<>l the editorial board also met with representatives
of each oj the groups and asked them about the
group's goals, its accomplishments during the past
year, plans for expansion or improvement in the
towing academic year and how special-fee funds
would be spent.
liased on the submitted information and
intervieji' discussions, the board reached an
endorsement decision for each group based on a
majority vote within the board. The board has
tried to include as much information about each
group as possible in the explanation of its
endorsements. The Daily encourages all students
to obtain a co/ry of the ASSI! Elections Handbook
and read each group's statement and budget to
reach then own concliisums.
AS NOTED IN the evaluation criteria
editorial published on March 28,
I ht> Daily has rated each student
group on a 1 to 5 scale that assesses the
group's effectiveness and its value.
In evaluating the groups, the editorial
hoard closely examined the achievements
of the fee groups during the past year and
the viability of the group's plans for the
upcoming year.
Student groups that are requesting a
spec ial lee for the first time were evaluated
on their expected effectiveness and value as
st't forth in their proposals and presenta
tions, as well as the viability of their plans
for the coming year.
Below is an explanation of the 1 to 5 rat
ing scale that was used as a composite score
for a group's effectiveness and value.
") — Group successfully met all goals set
out during the previous year, has a strong
sense of its constituency and an overarch
ing vision for the organization. Group's
activities are a valuable component of stu
dent life on campus and fulfill a need that
would otherwise go unmet. Has a viable
plan of activities for the coming year and
has clear goals lor improving on itself and

Spring Break (UO$1.11)
12 3 4 5
ASH is a strong program that provides over
150 students with I lie opportunity to explore
social issues, service learning and communi
ty action through various programs operat

putting its funds to efficient and effective
use.
4 — Group has successfully fulfilled
almost all goals set during the previous year
and knows whom it is serving. Group's
activities are a valuable contribution to the
Stanford community that would be missed
if absent. Group's plan for the upcoming
year is viable and includes efforts to fulfill
unmet goals and use its funds effectively.
— Group has 112 ulfilled many of its goals
and its plan for the upcoming year reflects
an effort to fulfill unmet goals and achieve
improvement. Group's activities are a value
to the Stanford community.
2 — (iroup has met few of the previous
year's goals. Plan for the upcoming year
does not clearly reflect effort to fulfill
unmet goals or does not seem viable.
Group's sense of its constituency is hazy
and its ability to effectively and efficiently
use funds is unclear, even though the
group's activities could be of value to stu
dents.
1 — (iroup has met no goals and has not
proven its value to the student population.
Group's ability to use funds effectively and
efficiently is questionable.
The individual fee group summaries
below aim to convey the group's accom
plishments during the year and its plans for
the coining year.

request amount. The per capita amounts
are taken directly from the ASSU Flections
Handbook. A "B" prior to the amount indi
cates the fee will be assessed to both under
graduate and graduate students; a "UO"
indicates the fee will be assessed to under
graduates only and a "GO" indicates the fee
will be assessed to graduates only.

ing during spring break. ASH definitively
serves a need I hat would otherwise go unmet
and would be missed should it not exist on
campus. The program needs its special fees
to continue operating and has made exten
sive efforts this past year to fundraise outside
of special fees. Since the program must limit
itself to a certain number of trips and stu
dents, ASH could increase its programming
in the spring quarter, such as holding
forums or dorm talks, so that participants
and leaders can share their service experi
ences with other students.

Asian American $28,569
Students (UO $ 1.48)
Association
12 3 4 5
AASA is an umbrella organization that pro
vides resources and support for 10 Asian-
American student groups. Its three-pronged
focus, on social, cultural and political issues, is
a well-executed one, making it a group that
would definitely be missed if it didn't exist.
AASA also makes an admirable effort to
fundraise and bring in money for its groups
outside of the monies it receives from special
fees, and it could focus on this more for the
upcoming year. AASA's programming is slay
ing balanced next year and will not increase to
any great extent, in conjunction with only a
I.() percent increase in special fee requests
from last year.
ASSU $89,770
Legal Counseling (B $2.18)
12 3 4 5
The ASSU Legal Counseling Office has pro
vided free legal advice to Stanford students
for many years. Although the LCO cannot
represent students in court, their staff attor
neys focus on "preventative law" and will
answer questions about parking tickets,
bankruptcy, and divorce, among other
issues. This past year, the LCO advised
about 700 graduate students and 400 under
graduates. Although their special fee request
is large, the service they provide is a huge
asset to the student body. However, it is
important that the LCO increase its publici
ty efforts dramatically since many students
are completely unaware that this invaluable
service even exists.
ASSU $121,901
Speakers Bureau (B $2.93)
12 3 4 5
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a student-run
organization that brings well-known speak
ers to campus, organizes debates and panel
discussions on current events and co-spon
sors other student groups' speaking events
and discussions. The group increased their
budget by 3.1 percent in order to increase
the amount of money they have available to
advertise their events and to have more
money available to attract world-renowned
speakers to campus. Fart of the ASSU Speak
ers Bureau special fee is used to pay the
salaries of its two officers. Providing free lec

tures by famous figures and assisting other
groups in doing the same makes the ASSU
Speakers Bureau a valuable organization on
campus whose presence would be missed.
Barrio $21,299.84
Assistance (UO $1.11)
12 3 4 5
This group has tutored school-age children
for 28 years, and they have a lot to show for
it, having used that time to build a presti
gious and effective program for area youth
who would have no exposure to a university
like Stanford otherwise. Their budget is
meticulously and efficiently organized and
they work very hard to establish outside
funding. They provide a strong link between
children in East Palo Alto and Stanford stu
dents. Barrio Assistance, in providing a stim
ulating experience of Stanford for young
children who return year after year, is truly
an invaluable asset to the community.
Black $27,270
Student Union (UO $1.41)
12 3 4 5
l he Black Student Union, a vital part of the
African-American community at Stanford, has
demonstrated a clear sense of purpose and
constituency as well as a broad range of pro
gramming designed to benefit not only the
Stanford community, but also, local areas.
Special fees provide funding for events such as
the Kwanzaa celebration, a welcome reception
for black freshmen during orientation, the
Soul Food Dinner and the BSU's high school
conference which is an important outreach
into Bay Area communities. In addition, the
BSU cosponsors many events with other cam
pus organizations such as the Kevin Powell
lecture this year, and the group plans to lix us
on attracting a prominent speaker to campus
in the coming year.
Club Sports $154,440
(B $3.75)
12 3 4 5
The Club Sports special fee provides fund
ing for the 18 Club Sports teams ranging
from squash to mountain hiking. These
teams receive little funding from the Athlet
ic Department, and the special fee is used to
cover the costs of equipment, travel and
other expenses. Stanford's Club Sports
teams enjoy unparalleled success around the

country with teams such as women's rugby
and women's ultimate Frisbee capturing
national titles last year. The special lee is cru
cial to the continuation oi" the hugely suc
cessful Club Sports program.
International $9,791.30
Undergraduate (UO $0.51)
Community
12 3 4 5
As the only on-campus group serving Stan
lord's population of international students
through events such as International Stu
dent Orientation, dinners, workshops and
cultural activities, lUC 112 ulfills a vital function
that would otherwise go unmet. However,
despite this apparent focus on international
students, the organization is open to every
one and attempts to reach out to students
from all backgrounds in its programming.
Moreover, this year's special fee request rep
resents only a small request increase from
last year's fee.
Kids with $9,134.39
Dreams (UO $0.47)
12 3 4 5
Kids with Dreams is a community service
organization whose primary goal in previous
years has been outreach to developmentally
handicapped children in the Bay Area. In the
last year, this organization has been successful
in also hosting a large, extremely successful,
and very well-organized conference introduc
ing the idea of "social entrepreneurship,"
demonstrating the group's commitment to the
campus community at large. Along with a
decrease in this year's special fee request, their
budgets reflect an efficient use of funding, and
they have been diligent in seeking alternate
sources of funding.
KZSU $84,944
(UO $2.06)
12 3 4 5
As a student-run radio station featuring sev
eral types of programming, including news,
sporting events, and music, KZSU provides
a valuable service to the campus. However,
the station could be more active in its overall
publicity efforts to make others more aware
of its presence. Furthermore, the organiza
tion has run into some problems with debt in
recent years that it must attempt to rectify
immediately.
