Bandy said the c hange would not affect po
lice practices. "I don't see it really making
that much of an impact,'' ltandy said. "Peo
ple will still be hearing their rights when we
decide to interrogate them."
I lie Stanford Police Department may be
the exception to the national rule, according
to Law Prof. Robert Weisberg, a specialist in
criminology.
"The Stanford Police Department is

probably not typical of the I .S. They tend to
be very well-educated, very thoughtful" to a
greater degree than in other parts of the na
tion, he said.
Weisberg also said that Miranda has not
hampered law ollic ials in obtaining infot illa
tion. " There are ways of, shall we say, getting
people to talk," he said.
"(Police] really don't find Miranda to be
much of an obstacle to investigation. It's
something of a human instinct to talk.'
Although the Miranda rights nia\ not
have had a significant impact on police prac -
tices, Weisberg does not believe the statute
should be upheld. "I clout believe the

Supreme Court should overturn decisions
unless iliev are really harmful," he said.
Far Ironi being harmful, VVeisherg said
thai he sees Miranda "lending an air of pro
fessionalism to polite work that it didn't have
before."
History professor and constitutional
scholar Jack Rakove agreed that "the Miran
da decision, I think by all counts, has had
great success."
Rakove said that there is no good reason
to overturn Miranda, saying that, " For what
ever reason, the 1908 statute was left [alone]
for over 30 years." I le said the issue was only
important to "a bunch of right-wing zealots."
