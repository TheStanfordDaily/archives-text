### AMIT GARG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite the controversy generated by a re
cent verdict against the I niversity in a gender
discrimination case filed by former Medical
School researcher Colleen Crangle, several
members of Stanford's faculty and stafl said the
campus generally promotes gender equity,
though some expressed concerns.
()n March 30, a federal court jury found that
there was no evidence of gender discrimination
in the Crangle case, but dec:?ded against the Uni
versity on charges of employee retaliation, rul
iiig that Stanford inusi pa\ $545,000 to Crangle.

(lender inequity was brought into the lime

Conlev, now associate clean lor Stanford's Palo
Alto Veterans Administration I lealth Care Ser
vices, who expressed liei grievances about dis
crimination at Stanford in her book "Walking

On April 12, 1 lie San Jose Mercury News
ran a letter to the editor from Pat i ic ia (iross, as

Polan, c haii <>l the Department of Gynecology
and ()bstetl ie s. 11klith Swain, c hair ol the De
partment of Medicine and Su/anne Pfefler,
c haii of the Department of Biochemistry.
I he editorial was a response to media cover
age of the Crangle case and argued that Stan
lord is "a good place lor women."
"I believe women are well treated at Stan
foul. Polan said. "In niv experience, they are
mentioned and promoted with the same in
vestment of time, energv and resources as are

the men."
"Stanford is by an large an open and wel
coming place," Swain s.iid. "The people are
treated equally. Ihe problem <>l gender in
equity is not as pervasive" as elsewhere.
Swain added, "[University President] Ger
hard [Casper] certainly paid his attention to this
part. Stanford has six female department c hairs,
the highest in the country. And until recentlv, it
had a female provost," (londoleez/a Rice.
Comparative Literature Assoc. Prof. David
Palombo-l .iu said he leels that, in general, Stan
ford | >rc miotes fairness despite s< >nie pre>blems.
"In my ten years the bias I have seen is un
ci >ns< ions. Wc linen's points of view are not as ac -
knowledged and are seen as less important that
others. I lieii areas ol scholarship are some
times not taken as seriously."
|amila Saudi, student affairs specialist <it Flo
rence Moore 1 hill, said, "I believe Stanford h;is
more racial inequality than gendei incqualitv.
"When I lit st caine to Stanford seven years
ago, I applied for ,'U) jobs," Saudi said. "I was re
jected t< > all of them and one said outright tli.it
the) sought a man. In (hose seven vears I
earned in\ Ph.D. but was si ill not accepted to the
job. I have complained, bin then there is retali
ation. And after that, no job."
Math Asst. Prof. |ulie Levanclosk\ said that
though she is relativeh alone as a woman in the
department, more women are coming up the
pipeline.
"I am one ol the three |female| file uli\ in the
Mat hematic s I )epai inient," she s.iid. "But that is
the case in the w hole country. As more women
earn Ph. D.sin math and sc iencc, the number is
bound to increase. I don't feel discriminated
[against | at Stanford."

Levandosky added, "Sadly, there is no
woman tenurcship in math yet. We three are all
relatively young and need mot e years to apply
for tenurcship, so ii is hard to say. Ilut then onlv
25 to 30 percent of math graduates are female
so we can not yet expect equal numbers among
faculty."
(llu is Stave, librarian at Lane Medical Li
brary, agreed. "I do not see gender inequality,
.ii least in the library," he said. "In Stanford in
general I have also not witnessed discrimina
tion. I have been to a lot of faculty meetings
and I feel that people treat each other as
equals."
|on Reicler, senior associate director of the
Office of I ndergraduate Admissions, said that
"affirmative action can ailed hiring but not
tenure, w Inch is decided upon merit."
"Besides," Reidercontinued, "the I nivcrsity
lias many women in top leadership positions. As
lai as 1 know, Stanford was the first major school
to have a female clean of admissions," Jean 112 el
ler (lliu.
Stanford indeed boasts of a high number of
women in leadership positions. As printed in
the Merc urv News editorial, in addition to the
six department heads, female leaders at Stan
fore 1 include "a senior associate dean, lour as
sociate deans and two center directors in the
S( hool ol Medicine, as well as the chiel execu
tive officer at Stanford I lospital and (Clinics."
"Certainly, the [Medical School] clean and
the provost oversee gender equity in terms of
salaries and promotions, and 1 believe tliev will
continue to do that," Polan said.
Swain said, "The trend is to remain vigilant
loi the future, making sure Stanford continues
to be a friendly place for both men and women."
