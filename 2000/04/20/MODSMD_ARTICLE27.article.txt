# Fields tell story of Cold War terror
## 
### AMY L. KOVAC CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Authors and Cold War sur
vivors Hermann and Kale Field
discussed their experiences from
1949 to 1954, when Mr. l ield dis
appeared behind the Iron Cur
tain, iu a series of public disc us
sions on campus this week.
The Fields co-authored
"Trapped in the Cold War: 1 lie
Ordeal of an American Family,"
which was recentl\ published b\
Stanford I niversity l'ress and in
cludes an afterword written In
I listorv Prof. Norman Naimark.
I he couple appeared vester
day at the Bookstore lor <i let lure
and book signing. On Moncla\ af
ternoon, tliev gave a seminar out
lining their book and answering
audience questions at the Hoover
Institution.
"I think it is wonderful to have
people who have lived through
this kind of history to speak to
scholars and students," Naimark
said. "Hermann Field, in particu
lar, is a marvelous, articulate
spokesman for a generation of
American progressives who were
caught up in the dangerous web of
('.old War rivalries."
" Flapped in the Cold War" is a
double memoir that explores Mr.
Field's incarceration In the Polish
Security Ministry in Warsaw and
his wife's attempts to find out
what had happened to her hus
band.
I lie story begins in August
1949 iu Warsaw where Mr. field
had traveled on a visit to Fasieru
Furope in order to trv to find out
what had happened to his broth
er, Noel, who had been at rested
by communist officials iu Czecho
slovakia in 1949.
()n his way back to Prague. Mr.
Field was abduc ted at the Warsaw
airport and taken to a the c ellar ol
a secret police prison, where he
was held for five years. During this
period, he was interrogated and
psychologically pressured to con
fess that he had been a Western
spy working to undermine the
Communist regimes in Eastern
Furope.
'" Flapped in the Cold War'
will become a standard item in
the growing literature on the
Cold War and 'I ligli Stalinism,' "

Naimark wrote in his contribu
tion to ilie book. "I iermann
Field's sheer intelligence and
human insight will surely estab
lish the book alongside such clas
sics as Art in" London's 'The Con
fession' and Arthur Koestler's
'Darkness at Noon' as a primer
for the psychology of internment
and the pathology of prison
warders in communist coun
tries."
Recounting the first stage of his
imprisonment, Mr. 112 ield recalled
thinking, "I don't know why I'm
here but the best thing I can do is
to tell them the whole story, then
the\ can see that I .1111 innocent."
I ni'ortunately, this strategy
didn't work. Bv using his friends
as references, he tried to prove bis
innocence, but Field said, "I was in
tad clcstrcning them bv this tactic,
which is very tragic."
In the second stage of his in
ternment, Mr. Field recounted
th.it his interrogators "let you stew
in your own juice. You ask your
self why, why, why. But, the more
you ask why, the more you destroy
yourself. They know this and they
use it to break you."
On the other side of the Iron
Curtain, Mrs. Field desperately
tried to influence the State De
partment to take up her hus
band's case.
"You have to try to make your
self important enough so tli.u thev
will do something for you. Mv first
reaction was that I had to convince
everyone that he wasn't a spy,"
Mrs. Field said.
Immediately after Mr. field's
release in 105 112. he and his wife set
about to write down their experi
ences. Because of an acute con
cern for family and friends who
still lived in Fastern Europe, they
did not think about publishing
their story until 1989.
"We sensed that we were a part
of a very important historical
event," Mr. Field said.
I oday at M:3() p.m. in Build
ing 40. room 112 I F, there will be a
screening of "Noel Field - Ihe
Fictitious Spy," a documentary
film by Werner Schweizer that
recounts Mr. Field's brother's
story. For more information re
