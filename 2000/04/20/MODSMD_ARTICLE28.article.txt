## Battle against Trojans may prove pivotal in Pac-10 race 
### BRETT KAUFMAN STAFF WRITER 
Big city, big" rival, big series.
The stage is set, and now the N'<>. 4 Cardinal must
take care of business as it travels to Los Angeles to
battle the USC Trojans tor one of the most pivotal
conference series of the season.
Stanford (29-9, 9-3 Pacific 10 Conference) rides
south on the tails of an eight-game winning streak
that leaves it tied with No. 3 Arizona State for first
place in the Pac-10. The trip continuing Stanford's
fiercest baseball rivalry is a diflicult one every year,
but the packed league standings make this particu
lar weekend ever more critical.
"1 say ibis every weekend, but in particular [this
series] is certainly huge," said head coach Mark Mar
quess. "USC is very diflicult to beat at home, and
they're one of the favorites to win the conference
along with us and Arizona State. So it will be big for
them to try to get back in it and for us to try to stav
where we are."
In a non-conference series in mid-March, the
Cardinal took two of three from ISC at Sunken Di
amond. \fter an early-season slump, the Stanford
bats began to heat up against Trojan pitching that
weekend and have not stopped since.
Stanford's offense has hit its stride midway
through league pla\ and lias shown no signs of re
gressing. I be Cardinal has scored more than runs

per contest during the current winning streak, giv
ing its pitching staff plenty of room for error.
Fortunately, that staff has been brilliant as well,
compiling a season team ERA of 3.37 that ranks
among the top ten in the nation.
One of the quiet but steady arms for Marquess
and the Cardinal this season has been that of sopho
more closer Jelf Bruksch. Bruksch has impressively
filled a role that was one of Marquess' largest con
cerns coining into the 2000 campaign.
Bruksch leads the team in appearances with 17,
and his eight saves lead the entire conference. The
eight saves this season also rank him fifth on the
school's all-time single-season saves list, with the
Stanford record of 13 within reach.
"If you're going to be a good team, you need a
guy that can come in to close the game out," Mar
quess said. "Jeff has given us that, and he's been phe
nomenal."
Last week, Bruksch saved three of Stanford's four
games and was rewarded with Pac-10 Pitcher of the
Week honors for the first time in his career. In his
three appearances, he limited opposing hitters to a
measly .087 batting average while strikingout seven.
The upcoming weekend in Los Angeles makes
Bruksch even more of a centerpiece, as the Beverly
Hills native transferred from USC last season. In his
return to Dedeaux Field, Bruksch must continue to

Stanford will use its regular

Young. Both have been out

in the bullpen. Cunningham's

for some time, however sopho

pitched well as a starter this sea

Marquess has not named ei

starter, preferring to use
whomever he deems best on am
given weekend.

be honest," Marquess said. "But I
