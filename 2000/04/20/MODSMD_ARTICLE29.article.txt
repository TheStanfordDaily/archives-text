# Toughness quotient sets down the standard for glory in sports agony

Alter shattering the hone in the tip ot
his pinky during a big game, San
Francisco 49ers defensive back Ron
nie Lot i was sent to the training
room to have I he damage assessed. Realizing
that the injurv was going to keep him out ot
the game tor longer than he was willing to
wait, Ronnie took drastic measures.
While the doc wasn't looking, Lott took a
scalpel .md sliced oil the battered bit ot
pinky, taped up the bloody tip and bolted
back to the field to play the rest of the game.
At least, that's the story 1 heard.
Now that's lough. And even if the story
isn't true, it makes you tougher just having
read it.
roughness is not easy to measure. If your
body was really tough, it would never suffer
sports injui ics, right ? But the nastier the in
jur\ \on do suffer, the tougher you appear.
It's a bizarre sports paradox.
I li;it's w h\ injuries must be assessed criti
calh tor their toughness quotient (1 Q). Suf
fering, say, a severed spinal cord on the
rugb\ lield and coming back to score the
winning tr\ is honorable ( 1 O 9.8).
Sitting out two football seasons with "turf
toe, however, is dishonorable (1 Q 12.2).
football seems to be the most common

breeding grounds for both high and low
toughness-quotient injuries. Somewhere in
the middle of the scale is football's most
common and complex injury, the knee
"blow out."
I he exact mechanics of the knee blow out
have never been uncovered, and nobod\
knows w hat's going on inside the joint in the
immediate aftermath.
Remember when Willie Howard's knee
collapsed during the Big (iaine? The official
injury report listed 1 loward's knee as simply
"blown out" and "currently hurting like
hell." That is the present state of blow-out
knowledge. In fact, the only certainty sur
rounding the blow out is that the long-term
result is a "trie k knee."
Baseball, on the other hand, gets low
marks on the toughness scale across the
board. When was the last time you saw a
baseball player carried off the field on ;i
stretcher? Never, because it has only hap
pened two times in the history ol the sport.
file first time was back when helmets
were not mandated and the bean ball was ;i
popular salutation: "Hello, I'm an ass, and
you're off to the hospital." Ihe other inci
dent involved an overweight manager who
suffered a coronary after eating c hili-cheese

fries before the game and
later arguing a c lose play
at the plate.
That's it. Nowadays,

the <>nl\ possibility for injury is a trachea
shattering line drive light hack at the pitch
er.
lint let's not give football all the credit tor
sports' mass production of injury. A track
and field meet, innocent as it may seem, is a
day of a thousand injuries waiting to hap
pen.
Doubters need only watch any length
hurdle race to understand. I'm not certain
when it was decided that blazing full speed at
barriers raised to exactly the height of your
crotchal region was safe, but it makes for top
class entertainment.
As the longest hurdle race, the 3,000-
meter steeplechase is arguably the most en
tertaining event in the spoil because of the
potential lor injury. The barriers in that race
don't fall down when they're hit, and a water
pit adds a slip factor into the mix. 1 'lie al
read\ emaciated bodies of distance runners
are probabh not best suited to this punish
ment.

Nasty injuries result. At this
season's Stanford Invitational, a
runner from BYU bailed over the
final barrier of the race, just 80
meters from the finish. Frantically
trying to stop his fall, the poor Joe
put his arms out in front to
smooth his landing, only to have
his forearm crumple in on him.

I he 90-degree bend he placed
right between the elbow and the
wrist was not just unnatural; it
looked tough as hell. Broken
bone I Q: K. 4.
Keep in mind that to receive an
even higher toughness mark, the
bone has to break out of the trap
pings of muscle and skin and expc >se
itself to the outside world. Stress
fractures are no good. 1 hat tibia,
t hat fibula, that snapped rib must be
out iincl swaying in the breeze.
Some injuries, like turf toe, are

so wussy that suffering should be
endured in silence. Tennis elbow,
swimmer's ear, rugby rash and
foosball wrist ail fall into this cate
gory.
But just about any truly painful
sports injury can improve your
overall toughness. Cet out, play
ball and get hurt â€” you'll be bet
ter off for it.

Hen Allen may or may not haw em
bellished the Ronnie Loll anecdote, hat
the coronaty part is strictly fact.
