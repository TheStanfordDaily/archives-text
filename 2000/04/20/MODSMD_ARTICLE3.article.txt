## High court reconsiders Miranda 
### JIM TANKERSLEY EDITORIAL STAFF 
WAS I UNC'i 1 ON, D.C. — I he Supreme (>oui I appears
unlikely to overturn its landmark Miranda decision fol
lowing oral arguments in its highest-profile criminal pro
cedure case in ;i") years.
During the hour-long arguments yesterday, a majority
of justices seemed (o disagree with University of I tah Law
Prof. Paul Cassell's argument that a 19()S federal law —
vshich does not require police to read defendants a lists of
rights before questioning I hem — supersedes the 1 9(H) de
cision, Miranda v. Arizona.
I he justices seemed to side with I .S. Solicitor (ieneral
Seth Waxman, who argued di.it the long-dormant law
does not go far enough in guaranteeing Fifth Amendment
safeguards against self-incrimination.
Waxman and Virginia attorney James Hundley repre
sented the plaintiff in Dickerson v. United States, yester
day's case. The court-appointed C.assell, Law School Class
of <S4 and a leading proponent of overturning Miranda, to
argue against them.
Miranda bars the state from using a criminal defen
dant's statements as trial evidence unless the interrogating
officer first advises him of his rights and the defendant
agrees to waive them.
In the last 35 years, the four "Miranda warnings" a de
fendant hears — he has the right to remain silent, any

statement can be used against him in court, he lias the right
to an attorney and the state will appoint him an attorney it
he can not afford one — have seeped into America's pop
ular culture.
I lie (>ourt has slowlv but steadily weakened Miranda in
that time. For example, it ruled in a 1984 case that prose
cutors may use as evidence a defendant's responses to lim
ited questions in an emergency situation, even it the de
fendant was not read Miranda rights.
Until last ()ctober, however, the Court had ignored the
1908 law. I he statute in question, w liii li (longress passed
as the Safe Streets and (.rime Act, attempted to oven tile
Miranda. It asserted that, in federal criminal trials, a self
incriminating statement "shall he admissible in e\ idence if
it is voluntarily given.
The Court agreed to review the issue alter the Fourth
Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.. ruled that the
1908 law supersetles Miranda. I lie ruling allowed prose
cutors to use iu trial accused bank robber Charles Dicker
son's confession — which polite obtained before reading
Dit keison his Miranda rights.
Lawyers on both sides of the case yesterda\ tried to cast
the .'55 years of post-Miranda criminal procedure decisions
in their favor. Hut in questioning them, the justices re
turned time and time again to the 1900 landmark case.
1 wo main issues divided the justices: Does the 1908 law
