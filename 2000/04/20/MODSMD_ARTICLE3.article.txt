# WASHINGTON, D.C. SPECIAL REPORT
## High court reconsiders Miranda 
### JIM TANKERSLEY EDITORIAL STAFF 
WAS I UNC'i 1 ON, D.C. — I he Supreme (>oui I appears
unlikely to overturn its landmark Miranda decision fol
lowing oral arguments in its highest-profile criminal pro
cedure case in ;i") years.
During the hour-long arguments yesterday, a majority
of justices seemed (o disagree with University of I tah Law
Prof. Paul Cassell's argument that a 19()S federal law —
vshich does not require police to read defendants a lists of
rights before questioning I hem — supersedes the 1 9(H) de
cision, Miranda v. Arizona.
I he justices seemed to side with I .S. Solicitor (ieneral
Seth Waxman, who argued di.it the long-dormant law
does not go far enough in guaranteeing Fifth Amendment
safeguards against self-incrimination.
Waxman and Virginia attorney James Hundley repre
sented the plaintiff in Dickerson v. United States, yester
day's case. The court-appointed C.assell, Law School Class
of <S4 and a leading proponent of overturning Miranda, to
argue against them.
Miranda bars the state from using a criminal defen
dant's statements as trial evidence unless the interrogating
officer first advises him of his rights and the defendant
agrees to waive them.
In the last 35 years, the four "Miranda warnings" a de
fendant hears — he has the right to remain silent, any

statement can be used against him in court, he lias the right
to an attorney and the state will appoint him an attorney it
he can not afford one — have seeped into America's pop
ular culture.
I lie (>ourt has slowlv but steadily weakened Miranda in
that time. For example, it ruled in a 1984 case that prose
cutors may use as evidence a defendant's responses to lim
ited questions in an emergency situation, even it the de
fendant was not read Miranda rights.
Until last ()ctober, however, the Court had ignored the
1908 law. I he statute in question, w liii li (longress passed
as the Safe Streets and (.rime Act, attempted to oven tile
Miranda. It asserted that, in federal criminal trials, a self
incriminating statement "shall he admissible in e\ idence if
it is voluntarily given.
The Court agreed to review the issue alter the Fourth
Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.. ruled that the
1908 law supersetles Miranda. I lie ruling allowed prose
cutors to use iu trial accused bank robber Charles Dicker
son's confession — which polite obtained before reading
Dit keison his Miranda rights.
Lawyers on both sides of the case yesterda\ tried to cast
the .'55 years of post-Miranda criminal procedure decisions
in their favor. Hut in questioning them, the justices re
turned time and time again to the 1900 landmark case.

"and does the Miranda decision
spell out a constitutional right
— which Congress can not su
persede without amending the
— or a procedural
one which Congress can over

* The Court sought, but did

sus on what Miranda meant to
constitutional law. Hut a majori
ty of justices did seem to agree
with VVaxman that the 19(i8 law
does not go far enough to pro

tect Fifth Amendment rights.
"The problem we have with
the statute here," Justice David
Souter said, "is it seems to go
112 rom a knowing waiver system . .
. out to a voluntary system, and
that does not seem to be an
equivalent (to Miranda) in tad or
in law."
Cassell argued the opposite,
asserting the IWiH law encour
ages police to obtain waivers be
fore interrogation, and said that
the statute may in fact go farther
than Miranda in safeguarding
against self-incrimination.
The Court met that sugges
tion with heavy skepticism. "It's
going to be tough to convince
me," Justice John Paul Stevens
said, "that [the law] was meant
to expand Miranda."

111 a related and troublesome
distinction for the justices, the
Court's conservative and liber
al-leaning sides debated the
question of whether the
tution guarantees defendants
(tic right to Miranda warnings
before interrogation.
Justice Antonin Scalia wasted
little time pushing his view that
Miranda ensures procedural,
not constitutional rights. Justice
Anthony Kennedy, Class of '58,
joined him in pressuring 1 lund
ley, the plaintiff's attorney, to
say il lie believes the warnings
are constitutionally protected.
When I lunclley faltered. Jus
lice Ruth Hader Cinsburg
picked up liis argument for
liiin. "Miranda, for the firsl
lime, put this right under the

Fifth Amendment," she said. "A
right to exercise your silence."
Si alia, Kennedy and Chief
)ustice William Reluujuist, Class
ol '4N, Law School Class of's2,
were kinder to, but still skeptical
of, Waxman, who argued that
Miranda did not establish a con
stitutional right to warnings. In

a son of minimum standard for

guarantees, a standard he said
the 19()8 law did not meet.

one which Congress can over
rule with a statute?
* The Court sought, but did
* not find, even a remote consen
sus on what Miranda meant to
constitutional law. Hut a majori
ty of justices did seem to agree
with VVaxman that the 19(i8 law
does not go far enough to pro

tect Fifth Amendment rights.
"The problem we have with
the statute here," Justice David
Souter said, "is it seems to go
112 rom a knowing waiver system . .
. out to a voluntary system, and
that does not seem to be an
equivalent (to Miranda) in tad or
in law."
Cassell argued the opposite,
asserting the IWiH law encour
ages police to obtain waivers be
fore interrogation, and said that
the statute may in fact go farther
than Miranda in safeguarding
against self-incrimination.
The Court met that sugges
tion with heavy skepticism. "It's
going to be tough to convince
me," Justice John Paul Stevens
said, "that [the law] was meant
to expand Miranda."

111 a related and troublesome
distinction for the justices, the
Court's conservative and liber
al-leaning sides debated the
question of whether the
tution guarantees defendants
(tic right to Miranda warnings
before interrogation.
Justice Antonin Scalia wasted
little time pushing his view that
Miranda ensures procedural,
not constitutional rights. Justice
Anthony Kennedy, Class of '58,
joined him in pressuring 1 lund
ley, the plaintiff's attorney, to
say il lie believes the warnings
are constitutionally protected.
When I lunclley faltered. Jus
lice Ruth Hader Cinsburg
picked up liis argument for
liiin. "Miranda, for the firsl
lime, put this right under the

Fifth Amendment," she said. "A
right to exercise your silence."
Si alia, Kennedy and Chief
)ustice William Reluujuist, Class
ol '4N, Law School Class of's2,
were kinder to, but still skeptical
of, Waxman, who argued that
Miranda did not establish a con
stitutional right to warnings. In
stead, lie contended it outlined
a son of minimum standard for
upholding Fifth Amendment
guarantees, a standard he said
the 19()8 law did not meet.
The Court will now deliber
ate on tlit' case, and deliver an
opinion by the end of its term in
J line.
