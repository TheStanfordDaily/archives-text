# Lacrosse to face Cal
## Stanford is optimistic for a win after two recent losses against East Coast teams 
### BROOKE MORRILL 
As the final game of the regular
season approaches, the Stanford
women's lacrosse team is prepar
ing itself both tactically and men
tally in order to win against Cali
fornia this Saturday.
I lie Cardinal (6-9) was victori
ous (>-;} in the last game against
Cal, which was played at Maloney
Field on February 26th.
"1 believe that both teams have
changed significantly since then.
We have both played a really
tough schedule and grown as
teams," head coach I leidi (lonnor
said. "I think that we are really
evenly matched and that it will be
a tough game."
Satnrda\ s game will not have a
major effect on the Cardinal's
standing in the playoffs next
weekend, where it lias already se
cured a position. Whether the
team wins or loses to Cal on Satur

day, the Cardinal will have to face
the Bears once again in its only
playoff game, which will be held at
UC-Davis. It will be the team's last
game before heading to the Final
Four Western Women's Lacrosse
League Championship in San
Diego in two weeks.
"I believe that we need to win
this weekend to prove to ourselves
that we are the better team," Con
nor said.
Sophomore Sara Lev added
that the team feels optimistic as it
heads into the weekend. After two
losses to Columbia and Hofstra,
Lev feels that they are ready for a
win.
"A win this weekend will deter
mine who has the mental edge as
we face each other again in the
playoffs. We realize the signifi
cance of this game and we are
ready," Lev said.
Team-building has been one of
Connor's focal points this season,
particularly since the loss of three
of the Cardinal's starters, junior
Katharine Barnes, senior Hedy
Born and freshman Addie Stru
molo, to injury.
