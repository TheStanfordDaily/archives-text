## Stanford is optimistic for a win after two recent losses against East Coast teams 
### BROOKE MORRILL 
As the final game of the regular
season approaches, the Stanford
women's lacrosse team is prepar
ing itself both tactically and men
tally in order to win against Cali
fornia this Saturday.
I lie Cardinal (6-9) was victori
ous (>-;} in the last game against
Cal, which was played at Maloney
Field on February 26th.
"1 believe that both teams have
changed significantly since then.
We have both played a really
tough schedule and grown as
teams," head coach I leidi (lonnor
said. "I think that we are really
evenly matched and that it will be
a tough game."
Satnrda\ s game will not have a
major effect on the Cardinal's
standing in the playoffs next
weekend, where it lias already se
cured a position. Whether the
team wins or loses to Cal on Satur

day, the Cardinal will have to face
the Bears once again in its only
playoff game, which will be held at
UC-Davis. It will be the team's last
game before heading to the Final
Four Western Women's Lacrosse
League Championship in San
Diego in two weeks.
"I believe that we need to win
this weekend to prove to ourselves
that we are the better team," Con
nor said.
Sophomore Sara Lev added
that the team feels optimistic as it
heads into the weekend. After two
losses to Columbia and Hofstra,
Lev feels that they are ready for a
win.
"A win this weekend will deter
mine who has the mental edge as
we face each other again in the
playoffs. We realize the signifi
cance of this game and we are
ready," Lev said.
Team-building has been one of
Connor's focal points this season,
particularly since the loss of three
of the Cardinal's starters, junior
Katharine Barnes, senior Hedy
Born and freshman Addie Stru
molo, to injury.
" Traveling together lor awa\
games really helps us work togeth
er as a team," Lev said. "We set
common goals, and we learn In
example from the competitive
teams that we face like Columbia
and I lofstra."
Senior co-captain Rachel Gal
lagher sees Satin (lay's game as an
"excellent opportunity for the un
derclassmen to gain confidence in
running the offense on their own

while complementing the spec
tacular performance that the de
fense continues to show."
In order to prepare for ibis
weekend's game, Conn* >r is empha
sizing offensive tactics. "We have
been working on s< >ine great plavsat
practice that w ill ensure a calm, yet
deadly attack," (lonnor said.
Offensively, Connor expects
stellar play from sophomores Li/
Britt and (laioline ()sterw ise, who
have displaved tremendous talent
throughout the season. Defensive
ly, Connor highlights sophomore
Jenny Silverman, who is at the lop
of her game.

As the team analyzes its com
petitor, it is particularly con
cerned with (".ill's leading scorer,
center Sarah Wheatley who is
known for her speed and one-on
one abilities. Wheatley lias 34
goals so far this season.
Sophomore Laura Kado, Cal's
second leading scorer, with 28
goals, is also a potential threat on
offense. 1 he Bears are going into
Saturdav's game against the Car
dinal with .i four-game winning
streak.
l he game will be played at
Berkeley \ Memorial Stadium at 2
p.m. this Saturday.
