had a

pro
les-

sional theater group, and they were
doing all kinds of plays," explains Puri.
"Western plays, adaptations and transla
tions. We did Strindberg, Ibsen, Ten
nessee Williams, Bernard Shaw and
Chekhov. Wonderful plays. And also
Indian plays, and that's what I got
hooked on to."
The socially conscious and relevant
theater appealed to his sense of youthful
idealism, what he calls "that kind of
peculiai idealism that led him into his
career - as an actor, and eventually, to
movie screens across the world.
Kven today, he comments on the rela
tionship between the cinema and the
politics of today's India, particularly
regarding the acts of violence carried
out l)\ zealots against theaters showing
Deepa Mehta's critically acclaimed 1996
film "Fire."
"Politically, [the government J should
lake a stand against such people. Which
was not taken. II the government
doesn't take a stand, I'm sure people
would throw that government out. Like
we have done in the past. All said and
clone, a majority of India believes in sec
ularism. But there are some naughty
characters in every community," lie says
with smile.
It is difficult for any interviewer not to
ask what ii was like to work with the late
Satvajit Ray, who is considered by many
to be the finest director that India lias
ever produced. Puri worked with Ray
on "Sadjati" (I9HI), an experience that
he not only explained, but enacted.
"I was absolutely' /.apped when I got
this news, that he wants to take me in his
film. I called him up and I was shiver
ing, I couldn't speak. And he s.iid, "I am
sending vou a copy of the script. I lave a
look at it, if you would like to do it.' I
said, 'Like to do it?' "
lie chuckles and continues. "He was
truly a Renaissance man. I le was a lilni
inaker — and I have worked with prac
tically every filmmaker in India, partic
ularly from the art cinema — who
stands out. I le was one w ho could write
his own sciipt, he could write his own
screenplay, his own stories, his own dia
logues . . . he could edit his own film, he
was handling his own camera, he was
doing his own music , he could design
his own publicity — von know, he was
wonderful at calligraphy."
Puri describes how R.i\ set up an arti
ficial lightning device in a village using
an arc welder and a trough used to feed
cattle, and his way of improvising on the
set.
"[Smila Patil, the lead actress in "Sad
jati "| had to leave that clay and [Ray]
had to finish a scene. So lie dec ided to
do the entire scene in one go, a kind of

mission scene, because he expected rain.
And then, he used rain for the scene,
and it added to it, gave it a more dra
matic quality.
"But he threw away his piece of paper
that had the different cuts on it. Instead
he decided to do it all in one [take].
Because he must have realized that the
rain may stop at any time. . . In a village,
where will he bring the artificial rain
from? And he was dead right. He had
three takes, and the rain stopped."
Today, Puri is the elder statesman of
the Indian film world.
Sounding every bit like an Indian
James Karl Jones, and c arrying himself
on screen with the method-acting inten
sity of a subcontinental Robert DeNiro,
he commands an incredible amount of
respect in his native India. Straddling
the boundaries between artistic films
and the gaudy showmanship of Bolly
wood, Puri explains his compromise as
one of necessity.
"Most of my films have been, particu
larly those of my early years, have been
totally with the art cinema, which have
been socially relevant. I mean, that c in
ema gave me status, respect, c redibility,
and also the opportunity to travel all
over the world, because those films did
go to film festivals. But they have a very
limited budget, so I also had to do com
mercial cinema, which is bit of a com
promise, because I don't really admire
those films, but one has to do those kind
of films for your facilities."
This has made Puri one of the most
versatile actors in India, and he takes his
position seriously.
"I have always been conscious of mv
choices, you know. II I am doing four
films in a year which are commercial,
because there are more commercial
films, then I must also do two art films
to keep the balance. And that's been my
statute. And also, I don't keep invself
very busy, which I c an.
"In Bombay, we make so many films,
and there's so much work, that I can
easily book myself for two years. But I
don't. I mean, I keep myself busv for
five to six months, maximum. The rea
son being that if there is any interesting
opportunity from outside, or even with
in India, if some art film maker
approaches me . . . So I can take up
those opportunities, and that has been
mv strategy even before I appeared in
Western films.''
Ilis entry into Western lilms is the
newest phase of his career. In many
ways, this phase is a rebirth, as Puri has
again worked his way to a top-billing
status by starting with the small parts
first. After a string of roles in
respectable, big-budget Hollywood
movies, including "City of Joy" (1992),
"Wolf (1994), and " The («iiost and the
Darkness" (199(>), Puri has found a
niche in the growing market for inde
pendent films. His two latest films, "Mv
Son the fanatic" (1998) and "Last is

Fast," which made its I nitccl Stales pre
miere lasi Friday, are both British
imports that feature Puri in a leading
role and deal with issues <>1 inulticultur
alism in the famih.
Far from typecasting him, the two
films explore the range that Puri is
capable of displaying on the screen.
While "Fanatic" has Puri playing
Parvez, a taxi driver who Puri describes
as "a man who is totally liberal, who
could easily be a citizen of the world,
and has the capacih to assimilate him
self in am culture," "Fast is East" casts
him as George Khan, "a very limited
human being."
A film that at least one viewer has com
pared to American Beautv, "Fast is
Fast" concerns itself with the inevitable
clash between the Pakistani dream and
the British dream, George Khan is Pak
istani immigrant with a British wife,
who tries to give their children a tradi
tional upbringing in l'.)7(K Manchester.
Against this backdrop, with the spec ter
of anti-immigrant demagoguen loom
ing large, the Khan children begin to
come of age — with unforeseen conse
quences. I he oldest son runs out on bis
wedding, another son is "snogging" the
girl across the street, and the lone
daughter has no intentions of being a
"traditional Pakistani woman.
Vacillating hilarious!) between come
dy and outright horror, first-time direc
tor Daniicn O'Donnell's movie is a
genre-busting look into the life of an
outrageous multicultural family. Filled
with the kilschiness of the seventies,
complete with a not-to-be-inissed nod to
the art scene, "Fast is Fast" vet) deli
catelv balances the luiinoi of I lie
Brady Bunch" with the terrors of
authoritarianism. fundamentalism,
racism and domestic violence.
Fhe cast is an unforgettable ensemble
that actualK looks, talks, and behaves
like a family might: I ariq (Jimi Mistry)
is a budding swinger, Maneer (Fmil
Marwa) plays "the good son," Saleem
((!11ris Bisson) is an aspiring sculptor,
and Auntie Annie (Lesley Nicol) stands
out as the chain-smoking best friend of
Mrs. Flla Khan (Linda Bassett). Iliese

roles may not break any stereotypes in
any other movie, but in Fast is Fast, they
show a South Asian family filled with the
same "types" as any other family —
which, in itself, seems like a first.
The actors perfectly complement Ayub
Khan-Din's script (which he adapted
from his own stage version of "Fast is
Fast"), and O'Donnell's direction, com
bined with Brian Tufano's cinematogra
phy, make for some truly striking
scenes. Puri describes the flow of the
movie aptly, when he says, "You laugh
and you stop and you think. You laugh,
stop, and think."
For Puri, this movie is a bit of a depar
ture. Rather than supporting big-name
Hollywood stars or carrying the screen
on his own, Puri shares the screen with
a cast who behaved more like a family
off-screen than they did on-screen. "We
talked, we played little games, we went
out for walks, we went to restaurants to
eat, and one day we had a little party in
my apartment, before we started film
ing. [Linda Bassett and 1] went out
shopping and bought the stuff at home
and the boys were invited, and we all
cooked together," recalls Puri.
Fhe youngest actor, Jordan Rout
ledge, who plays Sajid Khan, went home
on the weekends. "Before he would go
he would call me up and say, ' Oh, dad,
I am going home. I lave a nice weekend.
And I will see you on Monday.' He
would call his 'brothers,' and some
would tease him. You know, either
'bugger off or 'see you on Monday.' "
As an ac tor, Puri had to contend with
his character, the imposing and unsym
pathetic George Khan. For an actor who
"considers the script to be the Bible,"
this meant finding the subtext that
would allow him to make George more
than just a one-dimensional tyrant. Puri
recalls the process through which he
discovered (ieorge.
"The man has been married to this
woman for 25 years.' I "his woman, she is
not meek, this Englishwoman, she is not
timid, and yet she will take things laying
down. Why is that? I felt that what we
see in (ieorge Khan in this particular
film is a slice of his life. Not completely
him. He has been a reasonably good
father. Well, he does have a temper. Not
that he has been hitting his children all
his life. ()r his wife, for that matter.
"I think the film is the first time that
be lays a band on his wife. Because she
wouldn't have taken it."
Indeed, the issue of domestic violence
v\as .*-<l*4li( ult one for Puri to put on
film. "The most difficult clay was when I
bit in) wife. I found that we took quite
some time to work on that, and also to
find moments when we give the impres
sion of violence without actually being
violent."
I lie audience benefits from the fruits
of the labor that Puri put into "East is
Fast." Cieorge Khan is electrifying on
screen, with his explosive, stilted vocab

ulary and incensed glaring (complete
with close-ups on his burning eyes) at a
family that is increasingly alien to him.
He controls the screen through his
imposing silences, which increase in
their length and expressiveness, as
Khan comes to see that he has nothing
left to say. Puri joked that he should
have received an Oscar nomination for
his role in "My Son the Fanatic;" he
deserves one for "East is East."
The reviews from across the Atlantic
have been extremely encouraging to
Puri, as has its surprising mainstream
success.
"It's a big box office hit in Europe. It
started with 70 prints in England, and
by the end of its third week, it went up
to 280 prints, which is huge. And the
budget of the film was about £2.5 mil
lion, and it has already recovered £10
million in Britain alone," he says."It is
very encouraging for small films, it's
very encouraging for the Asian actors
who are working in England, you know,
who are trained and have very little
work."
Not content to rest on his laurels, and
well versed in the Bollywood system of
working on 14 films simultaneously,
Puri is in front of the camera again.
When asked if he would like to do
more international work, especially in
Hollywood, he replies, "I would love to.
I am not sitting idle, I am working. But
I would love to work outside [of India],
and I would love to play parts that are
challenging, which will keep me on my
toes . . . There is a curiosity [in Holly
wood]. A lot of people have seen the
film, and I hope and wish that I get a
meaty part in some Hollywood film.
Which hasn't happened so far, and I
hope it will happen. Till then, 1 am
happy doing small films." When his fans
think of his spectacular work in the
independent cinema, such as his role as
the lone Muslim in a Hindu village who
stands up to the institutionalized mis
treatment of women in "Mirch Masala"
(1985), it's hard not to think that Holly
wood's loss is the world's gain. After all,
not many actors today can claim to
match Om Puri's artistic creed: "Surely,
entertainment is very much a part of
life; it is very important for people to
laugh and to be entertained. But at the
same time, it will be a waste if we don't
use this medium for a social change or
for social benefits or to create aware
ness."


A Om Puri is one of India's best-known
and prolific actors.

stands up to the institutionalized mis
treatment of women in "Mirch Masala"
(1985), it's hard not to think that Holly
wood's loss is the world's gain. After all,
not many actors today can claim to
match Om Puri's artistic creed: "Surely,
entertainment is very much a part of
life; it is very important for people to
laugh and to be entertained. But at the
same time, it will be a waste if we don't
use this medium for a social change or
for social benefits or to create aware
ness."

sional theater group, and they were
doing all kinds of plays," explains Puri.
"Western plays, adaptations and transla
tions. We did Strindberg, Ibsen, Ten
nessee Williams, Bernard Shaw and
Chekhov. Wonderful plays. And also
Indian plays, and that's what I got
hooked on to."
The socially conscious and relevant
theater appealed to his sense of youthful
idealism, what he calls "that kind of
peculiai idealism that led him into his
career - as an actor, and eventually, to
movie screens across the world.
Kven today, he comments on the rela
tionship between the cinema and the
politics of today's India, particularly
regarding the acts of violence carried
out l)\ zealots against theaters showing
Deepa Mehta's critically acclaimed 1996
film "Fire."
"Politically, [the government J should
lake a stand against such people. Which
was not taken. II the government
doesn't take a stand, I'm sure people
would throw that government out. Like
we have done in the past. All said and
clone, a majority of India believes in sec
ularism. But there are some naughty
characters in every community," lie says
with smile.
It is difficult for any interviewer not to
ask what ii was like to work with the late
Satvajit Ray, who is considered by many
to be the finest director that India lias
ever produced. Puri worked with Ray
on "Sadjati" (I9HI), an experience that
he not only explained, but enacted.
"I was absolutely' /.apped when I got
this news, that he wants to take me in his
film. I called him up and I was shiver
ing, I couldn't speak. And he s.iid, "I am
sending vou a copy of the script. I lave a
look at it, if you would like to do it.' I
said, 'Like to do it?' "
lie chuckles and continues. "He was
truly a Renaissance man. I le was a lilni
inaker — and I have worked with prac
tically every filmmaker in India, partic
ularly from the art cinema — who
stands out. I le was one w ho could write
his own sciipt, he could write his own
screenplay, his own stories, his own dia
logues . . . he could edit his own film, he
was handling his own camera, he was
doing his own music , he could design
his own publicity — von know, he was
wonderful at calligraphy."
Puri describes how R.i\ set up an arti
ficial lightning device in a village using
an arc welder and a trough used to feed
cattle, and his way of improvising on the
set.
"[Smila Patil, the lead actress in "Sad
jati "| had to leave that clay and [Ray]
had to finish a scene. So lie dec ided to
do the entire scene in one go, a kind of

mission scene, because he expected rain.
And then, he used rain for the scene,
and it added to it, gave it a more dra
matic quality.
"But he threw away his piece of paper
that had the different cuts on it. Instead
he decided to do it all in one [take].
Because he must have realized that the
rain may stop at any time. . . In a village,
where will he bring the artificial rain
from? And he was dead right. He had
three takes, and the rain stopped."
Today, Puri is the elder statesman of
the Indian film world.
Sounding every bit like an Indian
James Karl Jones, and c arrying himself
on screen with the method-acting inten
sity of a subcontinental Robert DeNiro,
he commands an incredible amount of
respect in his native India. Straddling
the boundaries between artistic films
and the gaudy showmanship of Bolly
wood, Puri explains his compromise as
one of necessity.
"Most of my films have been, particu
larly those of my early years, have been
totally with the art cinema, which have
been socially relevant. I mean, that c in
ema gave me status, respect, c redibility,
and also the opportunity to travel all
over the world, because those films did
go to film festivals. But they have a very
limited budget, so I also had to do com
mercial cinema, which is bit of a com
promise, because I don't really admire
those films, but one has to do those kind
of films for your facilities."
This has made Puri one of the most
versatile actors in India, and he takes his
position seriously.
"I have always been conscious of mv
choices, you know. II I am doing four
films in a year which are commercial,
because there are more commercial
films, then I must also do two art films
to keep the balance. And that's been my
statute. And also, I don't keep invself
very busy, which I c an.
"In Bombay, we make so many films,
and there's so much work, that I can
easily book myself for two years. But I
don't. I mean, I keep myself busv for
five to six months, maximum. The rea
son being that if there is any interesting
opportunity from outside, or even with
in India, if some art film maker
approaches me . . . So I can take up
those opportunities, and that has been
mv strategy even before I appeared in
Western films.''
Ilis entry into Western lilms is the
newest phase of his career. In many
ways, this phase is a rebirth, as Puri has
again worked his way to a top-billing
status by starting with the small parts
first. After a string of roles in
respectable, big-budget Hollywood
movies, including "City of Joy" (1992),
"Wolf (1994), and " The («iiost and the
Darkness" (199(>), Puri has found a
niche in the growing market for inde
pendent films. His two latest films, "Mv
Son the fanatic" (1998) and "Last is

Fast," which made its I nitccl Stales pre
miere lasi Friday, are both British
imports that feature Puri in a leading
role and deal with issues <>1 inulticultur
alism in the famih.
Far from typecasting him, the two
films explore the range that Puri is
capable of displaying on the screen.
While "Fanatic" has Puri playing
Parvez, a taxi driver who Puri describes
as "a man who is totally liberal, who
could easily be a citizen of the world,
and has the capacih to assimilate him
self in am culture," "Fast is East" casts
him as George Khan, "a very limited
human being."
A film that at least one viewer has com
pared to American Beautv, "Fast is
Fast" concerns itself with the inevitable
clash between the Pakistani dream and
the British dream, George Khan is Pak
istani immigrant with a British wife,
who tries to give their children a tradi
tional upbringing in l'.)7(K Manchester.
Against this backdrop, with the spec ter
of anti-immigrant demagoguen loom
ing large, the Khan children begin to
come of age — with unforeseen conse
quences. I he oldest son runs out on bis
wedding, another son is "snogging" the
girl across the street, and the lone
daughter has no intentions of being a
"traditional Pakistani woman.
Vacillating hilarious!) between come
dy and outright horror, first-time direc
tor Daniicn O'Donnell's movie is a
genre-busting look into the life of an
outrageous multicultural family. Filled
with the kilschiness of the seventies,
complete with a not-to-be-inissed nod to
the art scene, "Fast is Fast" vet) deli
catelv balances the luiinoi of I lie
Brady Bunch" with the terrors of
authoritarianism. fundamentalism,
racism and domestic violence.
Fhe cast is an unforgettable ensemble
that actualK looks, talks, and behaves
like a family might: I ariq (Jimi Mistry)
is a budding swinger, Maneer (Fmil
Marwa) plays "the good son," Saleem
((!11ris Bisson) is an aspiring sculptor,
and Auntie Annie (Lesley Nicol) stands
out as the chain-smoking best friend of
Mrs. Flla Khan (Linda Bassett). Iliese

roles may not break any stereotypes in
any other movie, but in Fast is Fast, they
show a South Asian family filled with the
same "types" as any other family —
which, in itself, seems like a first.
The actors perfectly complement Ayub
Khan-Din's script (which he adapted
from his own stage version of "Fast is
Fast"), and O'Donnell's direction, com
bined with Brian Tufano's cinematogra
phy, make for some truly striking
scenes. Puri describes the flow of the
movie aptly, when he says, "You laugh
and you stop and you think. You laugh,
stop, and think."
For Puri, this movie is a bit of a depar
ture. Rather than supporting big-name
Hollywood stars or carrying the screen
on his own, Puri shares the screen with
a cast who behaved more like a family
off-screen than they did on-screen. "We
talked, we played little games, we went
out for walks, we went to restaurants to
eat, and one day we had a little party in
my apartment, before we started film
ing. [Linda Bassett and 1] went out
shopping and bought the stuff at home
and the boys were invited, and we all
cooked together," recalls Puri.
Fhe youngest actor, Jordan Rout
ledge, who plays Sajid Khan, went home
on the weekends. "Before he would go
he would call me up and say, ' Oh, dad,
I am going home. I lave a nice weekend.
And I will see you on Monday.' He
would call his 'brothers,' and some
would tease him. You know, either
'bugger off or 'see you on Monday.' "
As an ac tor, Puri had to contend with
his character, the imposing and unsym
pathetic George Khan. For an actor who
"considers the script to be the Bible,"
this meant finding the subtext that
would allow him to make George more
than just a one-dimensional tyrant. Puri
recalls the process through which he
discovered (ieorge.
"The man has been married to this
woman for 25 years.' I "his woman, she is
not meek, this Englishwoman, she is not
timid, and yet she will take things laying
down. Why is that? I felt that what we
see in (ieorge Khan in this particular
film is a slice of his life. Not completely
him. He has been a reasonably good
father. Well, he does have a temper. Not
that he has been hitting his children all
his life. ()r his wife, for that matter.
"I think the film is the first time that
be lays a band on his wife. Because she
wouldn't have taken it."
Indeed, the issue of domestic violence
v\as .*-<l*4li( ult one for Puri to put on
film. "The most difficult clay was when I
bit in) wife. I found that we took quite
some time to work on that, and also to
find moments when we give the impres
sion of violence without actually being
violent."
I lie audience benefits from the fruits
of the labor that Puri put into "East is
Fast." Cieorge Khan is electrifying on
screen, with his explosive, stilted vocab

ulary and incensed glaring (complete
with close-ups on his burning eyes) at a
family that is increasingly alien to him.
He controls the screen through his
imposing silences, which increase in
their length and expressiveness, as
Khan comes to see that he has nothing
left to say. Puri joked that he should
have received an Oscar nomination for
his role in "My Son the Fanatic;" he
deserves one for "East is East."
The reviews from across the Atlantic
have been extremely encouraging to
Puri, as has its surprising mainstream
success.
"It's a big box office hit in Europe. It
started with 70 prints in England, and
by the end of its third week, it went up
to 280 prints, which is huge. And the
budget of the film was about £2.5 mil
lion, and it has already recovered £10
million in Britain alone," he says."It is
very encouraging for small films, it's
very encouraging for the Asian actors
who are working in England, you know,
who are trained and have very little
work."
Not content to rest on his laurels, and
well versed in the Bollywood system of
working on 14 films simultaneously,
Puri is in front of the camera again.
When asked if he would like to do
more international work, especially in
Hollywood, he replies, "I would love to.
I am not sitting idle, I am working. But
I would love to work outside [of India],
and I would love to play parts that are
challenging, which will keep me on my
toes . . . There is a curiosity [in Holly
wood]. A lot of people have seen the
film, and I hope and wish that I get a
meaty part in some Hollywood film.
Which hasn't happened so far, and I
hope it will happen. Till then, 1 am
happy doing small films." When his fans
think of his spectacular work in the
independent cinema, such as his role as
the lone Muslim in a Hindu village who
stands up to the institutionalized mis
treatment of women in "Mirch Masala"
(1985), it's hard not to think that Holly
wood's loss is the world's gain. After all,
not many actors today can claim to
match Om Puri's artistic creed: "Surely,

ness."

film, and I hope and wish that I get a
meaty part in some Hollywood film.
Which hasn't happened so far, and I
hope it will happen. Till then, 1 am
happy doing small films." When his fans
think of his spectacular work in the
independent cinema, such as his role as
the lone Muslim in a Hindu village who
stands up to the institutionalized mis
treatment of women in "Mirch Masala"
(1985), it's hard not to think that Holly
wood's loss is the world's gain. After all,
not many actors today can claim to
match Om Puri's artistic creed: "Surely,
entertainment is very much a part of
life; it is very important for people to
laugh and to be entertained. But at the
same time, it will be a waste if we don't
use this medium for a social change or
for social benefits or to create aware
ness."

sional theater group, and they were
doing all kinds of plays," explains Puri.
"Western plays, adaptations and transla
tions. We did Strindberg, Ibsen, Ten
nessee Williams, Bernard Shaw and
Chekhov. Wonderful plays. And also
Indian plays, and that's what I got
hooked on to."
The socially conscious and relevant
theater appealed to his sense of youthful
idealism, what he calls "that kind of
peculiai idealism that led him into his
career - as an actor, and eventually, to
movie screens across the world.
Kven today, he comments on the rela
tionship between the cinema and the
politics of today's India, particularly
regarding the acts of violence carried
out l)\ zealots against theaters showing
Deepa Mehta's critically acclaimed 1996
film "Fire."
"Politically, [the government J should
lake a stand against such people. Which
was not taken. II the government
doesn't take a stand, I'm sure people
would throw that government out. Like
we have done in the past. All said and
clone, a majority of India believes in sec
ularism. But there are some naughty
characters in every community," lie says
with smile.
It is difficult for any interviewer not to
ask what ii was like to work with the late
Satvajit Ray, who is considered by many
to be the finest director that India lias
ever produced. Puri worked with Ray
on "Sadjati" (I9HI), an experience that
he not only explained, but enacted.
"I was absolutely' /.apped when I got
this news, that he wants to take me in his
film. I called him up and I was shiver
ing, I couldn't speak. And he s.iid, "I am
sending vou a copy of the script. I lave a
look at it, if you would like to do it.' I
said, 'Like to do it?' "
lie chuckles and continues. "He was
truly a Renaissance man. I le was a lilni
inaker — and I have worked with prac
tically every filmmaker in India, partic
ularly from the art cinema — who
stands out. I le was one w ho could write
his own sciipt, he could write his own
screenplay, his own stories, his own dia
logues . . . he could edit his own film, he
was handling his own camera, he was
doing his own music , he could design
his own publicity — von know, he was
wonderful at calligraphy."
Puri describes how R.i\ set up an arti
ficial lightning device in a village using
an arc welder and a trough used to feed
cattle, and his way of improvising on the
set.
"[Smila Patil, the lead actress in "Sad
jati "| had to leave that clay and [Ray]
had to finish a scene. So lie dec ided to
do the entire scene in one go, a kind of

mission scene, because he expected rain.
And then, he used rain for the scene,
and it added to it, gave it a more dra
matic quality.
"But he threw away his piece of paper
that had the different cuts on it. Instead
he decided to do it all in one [take].
Because he must have realized that the
rain may stop at any time. . . In a village,
where will he bring the artificial rain
from? And he was dead right. He had
three takes, and the rain stopped."
Today, Puri is the elder statesman of
the Indian film world.
Sounding every bit like an Indian
James Karl Jones, and c arrying himself
on screen with the method-acting inten
sity of a subcontinental Robert DeNiro,
he commands an incredible amount of
respect in his native India. Straddling
the boundaries between artistic films
and the gaudy showmanship of Bolly
wood, Puri explains his compromise as
one of necessity.
"Most of my films have been, particu
larly those of my early years, have been
totally with the art cinema, which have
been socially relevant. I mean, that c in
ema gave me status, respect, c redibility,
and also the opportunity to travel all
over the world, because those films did
go to film festivals. But they have a very
limited budget, so I also had to do com
mercial cinema, which is bit of a com
promise, because I don't really admire
those films, but one has to do those kind
of films for your facilities."
This has made Puri one of the most
versatile actors in India, and he takes his
position seriously.
"I have always been conscious of mv
choices, you know. II I am doing four
films in a year which are commercial,
because there are more commercial
films, then I must also do two art films
to keep the balance. And that's been my
statute. And also, I don't keep invself
very busy, which I c an.
"In Bombay, we make so many films,
and there's so much work, that I can
easily book myself for two years. But I
don't. I mean, I keep myself busv for
five to six months, maximum. The rea
son being that if there is any interesting
opportunity from outside, or even with
in India, if some art film maker
approaches me . . . So I can take up
those opportunities, and that has been
mv strategy even before I appeared in
Western films.''
Ilis entry into Western lilms is the
newest phase of his career. In many
ways, this phase is a rebirth, as Puri has
again worked his way to a top-billing
status by starting with the small parts
first. After a string of roles in
respectable, big-budget Hollywood
movies, including "City of Joy" (1992),
"Wolf (1994), and " The («iiost and the
Darkness" (199(>), Puri has found a
niche in the growing market for inde
pendent films. His two latest films, "Mv
Son the fanatic" (1998) and "Last is

Fast," which made its I nitccl Stales pre
miere lasi Friday, are both British
imports that feature Puri in a leading
role and deal with issues <>1 inulticultur
alism in the famih.
Far from typecasting him, the two
films explore the range that Puri is
capable of displaying on the screen.
While "Fanatic" has Puri playing
Parvez, a taxi driver who Puri describes
as "a man who is totally liberal, who
could easily be a citizen of the world,
and has the capacih to assimilate him
self in am culture," "Fast is East" casts
him as George Khan, "a very limited
human being."
A film that at least one viewer has com
pared to American Beautv, "Fast is
Fast" concerns itself with the inevitable
clash between the Pakistani dream and
the British dream, George Khan is Pak
istani immigrant with a British wife,
who tries to give their children a tradi
tional upbringing in l'.)7(K Manchester.
Against this backdrop, with the spec ter
of anti-immigrant demagoguen loom
ing large, the Khan children begin to
come of age — with unforeseen conse
quences. I he oldest son runs out on bis
wedding, another son is "snogging" the
girl across the street, and the lone
daughter has no intentions of being a
"traditional Pakistani woman.

dy and outright horror, first-time direc
tor Daniicn O'Donnell's movie is a
genre-busting look into the life of an
outrageous multicultural family. Filled
with the kilschiness of the seventies,
complete with a not-to-be-inissed nod to
the art scene, "Fast is Fast" vet) deli
catelv balances the luiinoi of I lie
Brady Bunch" with the terrors of
authoritarianism. fundamentalism,
racism and domestic violence.
Fhe cast is an unforgettable ensemble
that actualK looks, talks, and behaves
like a family might: I ariq (Jimi Mistry)
is a budding swinger, Maneer (Fmil
Marwa) plays "the good son," Saleem
((!11ris Bisson) is an aspiring sculptor,
and Auntie Annie (Lesley Nicol) stands
out as the chain-smoking best friend of
Mrs. Flla Khan (Linda Bassett). Iliese

roles may not break any stereotypes in
any other movie, but in Fast is Fast, they
show a South Asian family filled with the
same "types" as any other family —
which, in itself, seems like a first.
The actors perfectly complement Ayub
Khan-Din's script (which he adapted
from his own stage version of "Fast is
Fast"), and O'Donnell's direction, com
bined with Brian Tufano's cinematogra
phy, make for some truly striking
scenes. Puri describes the flow of the
movie aptly, when he says, "You laugh
and you stop and you think. You laugh,
stop, and think."
For Puri, this movie is a bit of a depar
ture. Rather than supporting big-name
Hollywood stars or carrying the screen
on his own, Puri shares the screen with
a cast who behaved more like a family
off-screen than they did on-screen. "We
talked, we played little games, we went
out for walks, we went to restaurants to
eat, and one day we had a little party in
my apartment, before we started film
ing. [Linda Bassett and 1] went out
shopping and bought the stuff at home
and the boys were invited, and we all
cooked together," recalls Puri.
Fhe youngest actor, Jordan Rout
ledge, who plays Sajid Khan, went home
on the weekends. "Before he would go
he would call me up and say, ' Oh, dad,
I am going home. I lave a nice weekend.
And I will see you on Monday.' He
would call his 'brothers,' and some
would tease him. You know, either
'bugger off or 'see you on Monday.' "
As an ac tor, Puri had to contend with
his character, the imposing and unsym
pathetic George Khan. For an actor who
"considers the script to be the Bible,"
this meant finding the subtext that
would allow him to make George more
than just a one-dimensional tyrant. Puri
recalls the process through which he
discovered (ieorge.
"The man has been married to this
woman for 25 years.' I "his woman, she is
not meek, this Englishwoman, she is not
timid, and yet she will take things laying
down. Why is that? I felt that what we
see in (ieorge Khan in this particular
film is a slice of his life. Not completely
him. He has been a reasonably good
father. Well, he does have a temper. Not
that he has been hitting his children all
his life. ()r his wife, for that matter.
"I think the film is the first time that
be lays a band on his wife. Because she
wouldn't have taken it."
Indeed, the issue of domestic violence
v\as .*-<l*4li( ult one for Puri to put on
film. "The most difficult clay was when I
bit in) wife. I found that we took quite
some time to work on that, and also to
find moments when we give the impres
sion of violence without actually being
violent."
I lie audience benefits from the fruits
of the labor that Puri put into "East is
Fast." Cieorge Khan is electrifying on
screen, with his explosive, stilted vocab

ulary and incensed glaring (complete
with close-ups on his burning eyes) at a
family that is increasingly alien to him.
He controls the screen through his
imposing silences, which increase in
their length and expressiveness, as
Khan comes to see that he has nothing
left to say. Puri joked that he should
have received an Oscar nomination for
his role in "My Son the Fanatic;" he
deserves one for "East is East."
The reviews from across the Atlantic
have been extremely encouraging to
Puri, as has its surprising mainstream
success.
"It's a big box office hit in Europe. It
started with 70 prints in England, and
by the end of its third week, it went up
to 280 prints, which is huge. And the
budget of the film was about £2.5 mil
lion, and it has already recovered £10
million in Britain alone," he says."It is
very encouraging for small films, it's
very encouraging for the Asian actors
who are working in England, you know,
who are trained and have very little
work."
Not content to rest on his laurels, and
well versed in the Bollywood system of
working on 14 films simultaneously,
Puri is in front of the camera again.
When asked if he would like to do
more international work, especially in
Hollywood, he replies, "I would love to.
I am not sitting idle, I am working. But
I would love to work outside [of India],
and I would love to play parts that are
challenging, which will keep me on my
toes . . . There is a curiosity [in Holly
wood]. A lot of people have seen the
film, and I hope and wish that I get a

Puri is in front of the camera again.
When asked if he would like to do
more international work, especially in
Hollywood, he replies, "I would love to.
I am not sitting idle, I am working. But
I would love to work outside [of India],
and I would love to play parts that are
challenging, which will keep me on my
toes . . . There is a curiosity [in Holly
wood]. A lot of people have seen the
film, and I hope and wish that I get a
meaty part in some Hollywood film.
Which hasn't happened so far, and I
hope it will happen. Till then, 1 am
happy doing small films." When his fans
think of his spectacular work in the
independent cinema, such as his role as
the lone Muslim in a Hindu village who
stands up to the institutionalized mis
treatment of women in "Mirch Masala"
(1985), it's hard not to think that Holly
wood's loss is the world's gain. After all,
not many actors today can claim to
match Om Puri's artistic creed: "Surely,
entertainment is very much a part of
life; it is very important for people to
laugh and to be entertained. But at the
same time, it will be a waste if we don't
use this medium for a social change or
for social benefits or to create aware
ness."


A Om Puri is one of India's best-known
and prolific actors.
