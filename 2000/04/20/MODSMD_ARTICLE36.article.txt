# Reinventing a pioneering vision, dance company creates magic

### CHRIS CROWELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Hie Martha (irahain Dame ('.ompam has been i lial
lenged to redefine itself in the wake of the 1991 death
of its founder and namesake.

But none of those difficulties were evident at lues
da) night's Memorial Auditorium performance.
Instead, a sold-out theater was treated to a breath
taking revue of some of (irahain s most powerful
choreography.

Among the works on display were "Diversion
of Angels," an exploration of love's nuances;
"Kl PenitenU'." depicting a violent purgation
from sin; and "Appalachian Spring," C.ra-

hain's ode to the American frontier.
I he (Company has existed since 192(), when
it burst onto the modern dance scene with a
revolutionary' redefinition of space and move
ment. (iraham's technique, which lias been
tradeni.irked, is a unique way of contracting
and releasing the body.

Artistic Director Designate Janet Kiler, who
performed with the Company lor more than
20 years, describes Graham's technique as a
"desire to break away, to find a voice for mod
ern concerns, to express a more primal sensi
bility . . . Yon have to think of it as theater, but
watch it with your heart."

Kiler contrasts Graham's work with the more dec
orative style of traditional ballet, but the Company's
display is aesthetically dazzling in its own right. Vibrant cos-

tuming and subtle light design both work to complement the
dancers' grace.

Some things have changed in the 75 years since the (Company's found
ing. Dancers are physically stronger, able to leap higher and move
faster. Costume fabrics are more varied. But, Kiler attests, the I roupe
has remained faithful to "Graham's meaning and intent."


A Martha Graham's memory drives the company she founded.
In a (|iicstion-and-answct session after
the show, I>akim was asked by an audi
ence tncmbci whether it was difficult to
express those universals in a world "not
in i<uu 11 with deep, core values."
Dakin invoked "Errand into the
Ma/e," .ilso performed Tuesday
evening, as evident e that (.rahani's mes
sage i-> still relevant today. "Errand into
the Ma/e" depicts the inylli of Ariadne,
forced to confront the Minotaur.
"Even when we perform foi people in
cultures which don't share our Western
Greek mythology, they understand
because I hex share the same essential
stories," Dakin said.
Principal Dancer Miki Orihara con
curred: "When you're sad, you're sad,
no matter where you're from."
Anolhei audience member, visibly

moved, proclaimed that "Diversion of
Angels" was the "most beautiful thing (he) had
evct seen" and asked the dancers about the
expet ience of performing ii.
I*i illc 11>aI Dancer Katherine Grockett said
that the piece mirrors the "spiritual plane" that
love takes one to, while Dancer Tadej Brdnic
(lest i ibeel the process ol "taking risks and mak
ing mistakes" which he feels define both love
:i 1 uI the execution of his craft.
Cast members also emphasized the breadth
of Graham's body of work, which includes ISO
choreographed works, and the extent of the
artist's influence. Daiken pointed especially to
Graham's impact on costume design and
ac tors' physicality in contemporary theater
So what was it like to work with a living leg
end? Tilber recalled Graham's chameleon-like
persona and the fierce competition between
Graham and her dancers in the early years.
"She could be anything. Mean, flirtatious, gen
erous. B\ my generation she was nicer. She
could have proteges instead of competitors."
Associate Artistic Director and Principal
Dancer I erese Gapucilli, with the Gompany
since praised Graham for being progres
sive. "She was always looking forward, and
never looking back."
(. apll< illi also expressed how important it was
that the Company remain true to Graham's
legacy. Gapucilli revealed that dancers today
learned by watching videotapes of Graham's
performances, though Graham herself dis
-11 listed film as an adequate expt ession of what
live audiences see and feel during a show.
(laptu illi acknowledged the impossibility of
reproducing Graham's work with exactitude,

but dismissed tlie importance of small alter
ations. "Martha herself changed much of her
choreography throughout her career."
Additionally. Capucilli indicated that she and
other dancers lucky enough to have collabo
rated with Graham were working to pass on
the artist's work directly to a new generation.
I'his continuity, the dancers agreed, was the
essential element in assuring the survival and
integrity of Martha Graham's Gompany.
Still, the group's future is far from certain.
Ron I'rotas, Martha's designated successor,
was recently removed by the Gompany's Board
from his post as artistic director, 112 inancial dif
ficulties have forced the Gompany to sell its
legendary New York training facility.
I his United States tour, which began in Jan
uary and is nearing its (lose, represents the
Gompany's concerted effort to recapture its
standing as America's preeminent modern
dance company. The Gompany will also be
travelling in Europe this summer.
Despite recent turbulence, the group's goal
remains the same: to honor Graham's extraor
dinary legacy and pass Graham's gift on to oth
ers.
Asked whether the Gompany would incorpo
rate other choreographers' work into its reper
toire, Dakcn said yes. But Daken sees little rea
son to deviate from Graham's creation.
"Each of the works in Graham's opus has so
many levels of reality. You still feel it like a
brand-new discovery each performance. The
work is so deep and broad in intellectual and
physical terms. . . . There's ISO works, and we
haven't done them all vet."
