Hie Martha (irahain Dame ('.ompam has been i lial
lenged to redefine itself in the wake of the 1991 death
of its founder and namesake.

But none of those difficulties were evident at lues
da) night's Memorial Auditorium performance.
Instead, a sold-out theater was treated to a breath
taking revue of some of (irahain s most powerful
choreography.

Among the works on display were "Diversion
of Angels," an exploration of love's nuances;
"Kl PenitenU'." depicting a violent purgation
from sin; and "Appalachian Spring," C.ra-

hain's ode to the American frontier.
I he (Company has existed since 192(), when
it burst onto the modern dance scene with a
revolutionary' redefinition of space and move
ment. (iraham's technique, which lias been
tradeni.irked, is a unique way of contracting
and releasing the body.

Artistic Director Designate Janet Kiler, who
performed with the Company lor more than
20 years, describes Graham's technique as a
"desire to break away, to find a voice for mod
ern concerns, to express a more primal sensi
bility . . . Yon have to think of it as theater, but
watch it with your heart."

Kiler contrasts Graham's work with the more dec
orative style of traditional ballet, but the Company's
display is aesthetically dazzling in its own right. Vibrant cos-

tuming and subtle light design both work to complement the
dancers' grace.

Some things have changed in the 75 years since the (Company's found
ing. Dancers are physically stronger, able to leap higher and move
faster. Costume fabrics are more varied. But, Kiler attests, the I roupe
has remained faithful to "Graham's meaning and intent."


A Martha Graham's memory drives the company she founded.
