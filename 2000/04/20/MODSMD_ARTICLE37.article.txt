\ good foot shorici than I am and small in even
aspect ol the word, her shoulders are nanow and
l)on\ and the hand that she oilers in greeting is
almost c hildlike in si/e. I hough she is no longer
emaciated, with breasts and a normal amount of
flesh on het stomach, it's ;is if ih.it flesh is siniph

or to grow past the si/e at which it stopped being
fed.
(iottlieb was I I when she developed the eating
disorder, which is characteri/ed bv a preocc n pat ion
with dieting and thinness, an altered bod\ image,
and excessive weight loss. As her weight plummet
ed. her thoughts and feelings became more and
more distorted. At one point, she would hold liei
breath to avoid taking in unwanted calories from
the smell <>l lood. Looking .it a photograph of a
starying. emaciated girl intended to elicit pit\ and
motivate donations, she saw a neat ideal body to
w Inch she could aspii e.
During this time, (iottlieb — now a first-year
Stanford medical student — c archills recorded liei
thoughts and feelings in her diary. Twenty-two
years later, she published an edited version ol the
diar\ as the book "Stick Figure."

It can be hard to identify what is disordered, per
se. because our culture seems to push women in
that diree lion. (iottlieb savs. " \lllhe feedback I had

and not running around like the guvs. And the\
shouldn't be eating dessert. And thc\ should be

ders how one can draw the line between propel

She points out thai the media also piesents unre

offhand comments like "she's got lluindei thighs,

may feel cultural pressure to be thin — at am cost.
