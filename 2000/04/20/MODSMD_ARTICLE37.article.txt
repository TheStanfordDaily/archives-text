of her I'alo Alio apai tment, she answers dressed in
.1 lorm lilting pink shirt.
\ good foot shorici than I am and small in even
aspect ol the word, her shoulders are nanow and
l)on\ and the hand that she oilers in greeting is
almost c hildlike in si/e. I hough she is no longer
emaciated, with breasts and a normal amount of
flesh on het stomach, it's ;is if ih.it flesh is siniph
sun k on to a bod\ which still refuses to accept fat
or to grow past the si/e at which it stopped being
fed.
(iottlieb was I I when she developed the eating
disorder, which is characteri/ed bv a preocc n pat ion
with dieting and thinness, an altered bod\ image,
and excessive weight loss. As her weight plummet
ed. her thoughts and feelings became more and
more distorted. At one point, she would hold liei
breath to avoid taking in unwanted calories from
the smell <>l lood. Looking .it a photograph of a
starying. emaciated girl intended to elicit pit\ and
motivate donations, she saw a neat ideal body to
w Inch she could aspii e.
During this time, (iottlieb — now a first-year
Stanford medical student — c archills recorded liei
thoughts and feelings in her diary. Twenty-two
years later, she published an edited version ol the
diar\ as the book "Stick Figure."

It can be hard to identify what is disordered, per
se. because our culture seems to push women in
that diree lion. (iottlieb savs. " \lllhe feedback I had
been getting |inunediateb prioi to cle\elo|)ing

and not running around like the guvs. And the\
shouldn't be eating dessert. And thc\ should be

behavioi and disordered eating when women are
encouraged local <>nl\ salad lotdinnei.
She points out thai the media also piesents unre
alistic images ol women. W hen that gels added to
offhand comments like "she's got lluindei thighs,
or compliments that a woman tna\ receive foi los
ing weight, it's not so difficult to see how a woman
may feel cultural pressure to be thin — at am cost.

What's worse is tli.it people don't realize how early girls start tak
ing in that information. "And they're going to use that as a foun
dation lor how the\ view themselves lot the rest of tlieit lives,
unless something comes in to < liange that," Gottlieb explains.
Recent l\, (.ottlieh leai tied exa< 11 \ how one particular I 1-year-old
felt when confronted with these cultural pressures. After she
decided to appl\ to medical st hool, (lottlieb went hack to her child
hood home to look loi some old ( heniistry notes and instead stnm
hled upon hei diar\. She had received the diary as a present for
her I I ill birthdav, onl\ months before she would face her battle
with anorexia. Inspired b\ " I he I)i.ir\ of Anne Frank," she poured
hei heart out into the lam \, gold-trimmed book, detailing her pri
vate thoughts and feelings.
l wenl\ wars later, Gottlieb, now completely past hei eating dis
order. saw something universal in those meticulously documented
experiences, something to which all women could relate. She
dest t ibes it as "the words of an II -year-old [about] what it's like . .
. in our culture to go through that transition from being a girl to
being a woman, when the roles change . . . and all of a sudden this
emphasis on how von look and how von at t and how you behave
becomes paramount."
Spurred on In reactions from women and aided by connections
within the writing indnstrv, Gottlieb decided to edit her diaries
into a cohesive narrative and publish tlieni. Since its publication,
"Stitk Figure" has been receiving .1 landslide of media attention,
(■ottlieh has been featured on such programs as "Fntertaininent
l onight, "Good Morning America,"and "Fecza," and her hook
was just optioned lor film by Martin Scorsese.
'St it k Figure" is an interesting read; as the < harismatic narrator
slowly takes us tleep into the disordered world of anorexia, we
watch her slowly niorph from .1 normal, mildly rebellious girl into
an obsessive calorie-counter, a girl who feels compelled to deceive
everyone about how ninth she eats. At one point, while getting a
Gl scan, which would let doctors observe her intestines, she is
forced to drink a pink fluid. Her distorted thinking is never more
blatant than when she asks the doctors to tell her exactly when the
pink fluid is converted into fat so she can watch it happen. At times
childlike, insightful, humorous, and even pathetic, "Stick Figure"
is an enlightening look at a pervasive problem in our culture.
Gottlieb isn't too surprised that people are taking notice of her
book. "Basically, evervbody who is female has responded to this in
some way," she explains. "Because I don't know a woman on the
planet who hasn't questioned whether or not she looks fat."
A former Hollywood executive, Gottlieb is a smooth talker with
a voice and face reminiscent of Beet a from "Fife Goes On," and
she knows exactly what she wants to see printed in this story.
Before we talk, her publishers send me a copy of suggested ques

lions, which, though I never directh ask any of them, I notice she
somehow manages i<> completeh address. ()n my way out, she
gives me a copv ol a previoush written stor\ about her that she
liked.
Sitting at her dining room table, she takes up about a quarter of
her (hail as she leans into the corner between the chair and the
kitchen counter behind her. She rests her left arm on the counter,
keeping her hand in her straight dark hair as we talk, as if holding
it back from her face. As she nods hei head in recognition of an
acceptable question, 1 notice that it feels slightl) awkward to con
verse with her. I reali/e later that this is because many of my ques
tions go unanswered, serving instead as vehicles for her to redirect
the conversation back where she wants it.
()ne topic that I particularly wanted to discuss was (iottlieb's par
ents. One of the most stunning elements in "Stick Figure" is the
consistentlv selfish, uncaring, and immature manner in which (iot
tlieb's mother treats her. References to her eating disorder as
something Gottlieb is doing to her mother, alongside comments
like-, " I he pain only begins with childbirth," epitomize the ego
centric mentalitN held In (lottlieb's mother. (lottlieb's father
doesn't come ac ross as am more caring, though his shortcomings
as a parent are less blatant.
Spurred on In the reactions of Other readers, I inquire into (iot
tlieb's current feelings about her parents, 112 irst, she launches into a
speech about how difficult ii is to diagnose anorexia, l hen, she
explains that anorexia cannot be caused by any one influence,
finally, she admits that the book paints a pretty good picture of
her parents. When I ask how her relationship with her parents is
now, her one-line response is. "Very different from when I was
I 1." F.nd of discussion.
I "his is one of several topics that, though relevant and interest
ing, (iottlieb firmly refuses to discuss. I guess this is somewhat
exc usable when you consider that she is, after all, simply a Stan
ford medical student w ho dec ided to open some of her most per
sonal thoughts to the world.
"I thought it was important to put out there because I had the
original source material and there was nothing really like it . . . It's
[ written during! the age before you start censoring your thoughts."
At I 1 years old, (iottlieb explains, girls don't yet have abstract
thinking, so they are strictly logical. They see the paradoxes found
in media messages, like iu a magazine with a recipe for cookies on
one page and a diet plan telling you never to eat those cookies on
the next. Meanwhile, an older girl may be so absorbed in the cul
ture that she no longer notices these mixed messages.
"Stick 112 igure" is unique because it presents the thoughts of an
1 1-year-old anorexic girl almost entirely as she experienced them
at the time, (iottlieb says that she had no motivation to write an
anorexia memoir, an approach which has already been used time
and time again. Rather, she wanted to "preserve the voice" that she
naturally had as an I 1 -year-old writing iu her diary, keeping "Stick
112 igure" authentic to those diary entries.
(iottlieb claims that she limited her present involvement to an
"edit job," piec ing the dian entries together into a cohesive narra
tive, omitting irrelevant details, and including "anything that moti

vated what was going on, in terms of my behavior."
Yet, even if she doesn't openly admit it, it seems pretty clear that
at the very least, some transitions, as well as the storybook ending
("Because I sort of do feel different now. And maybe what's differ
ent is that I kind of think there's nothing wrong with being differ
ent in the first place. . ."), are simply too mature and too well
thought out to have been written in an 11-year-old's diary. More
over, in certain parts of the book, the undernourished narrator is
barely able to stand up without fainting from lack of energy. It
seems quite unlikely that this same narrator then had the energy
to meticulously document that experience. The consensus among
readers with whom I have spoken is that "Stick Figure" is the high
ly successful attempt of an adult to write an interesting, socially rel
evant story that is directly based on her childhood diary.
Regardless of its authenticity, it can still be a shocking experience
when something as personal as a diary is suddenly "out there,"
available to anyone with $22 to drop. Yet, Gottlieb feels protected
by the universality of her experiences. "I don't feel as naked out
there because I think everyone sees their own experience in my
experience," she explains. People reading the story see it as a com
ing of age tale of young women in general, not as "the Lori (iot
tlieb story. Because who really cares what the Lori (iottlieb story
is," she asks me, ironically, the week before she is scheduled to tell
that story on "Entertainment Tonight."
(iottlieb hopes that as people learn more about anorexia, the uni
versal story can have a different plot, one with no place for eating
disorders. "I think prevention is really important in creating some
kind of awareness about these issues and in preventing girls from
going down that path," she says.
But, contrary to current medical theories, Gottlieb feels that even
if girls have started down that path, it is not too late. "There's a
theory in medicine that one can never recover from anorexia, that
it's like alcoholism . . . the potential for problems is always there. I
take issue with that because I am fully recovered," she explains.
(iottlieb dedicates time to helping other disordered girls recover
and learn to be comfortable with their bodies. Through Stanford
medical school, she speaks to patients, support groups, and stu
dents. One issue she hopes to emphasize is the distinction between
health and image. "1 wish . . . the norm would be that we eat
healthy food and we exercise because we want to be healthy, [not
to look] like some unrealistic ideal that is dangerous. It's not so
much about whether [girls] get very skinny. It's about how com
fortable do they feel in their own skin. And it's very hard for
women, given the pressures that surround them, to feel comfort
able in their bodies."
I lopef ully, by exposing the universality of these issues, Gottlieb's
book can help women to feel more comfortable. At the very least,
now they know that their experiences are not unique.
Perhaps Gottlieb's storybook ending says it best after all. In our
liposuction society that endorses the philosophy, "You can never
be too rich or too thin," Gottlieb writes. "I kind of think there's
nothing wrong with being different in the first place. I mean, it's
possible, isn't it?"

kitchen counter behind her. She rests her left arm on the counter,
keeping her hand in her straight dark hair as we talk, as if holding
it back from her face. As she nods hei head in recognition of an
acceptable question, 1 notice that it feels slightl) awkward to con
verse with her. I reali/e later that this is because many of my ques
tions go unanswered, serving instead as vehicles for her to redirect
the conversation back where she wants it.
()ne topic that I particularly wanted to discuss was (iottlieb's par
ents. One of the most stunning elements in "Stick Figure" is the
consistentlv selfish, uncaring, and immature manner in which (iot
tlieb's mother treats her. References to her eating disorder as
something Gottlieb is doing to her mother, alongside comments
like-, " I he pain only begins with childbirth," epitomize the ego
centric mentalitN held In (lottlieb's mother. (lottlieb's father
doesn't come ac ross as am more caring, though his shortcomings
as a parent are less blatant.
Spurred on In the reactions of Other readers, I inquire into (iot
tlieb's current feelings about her parents, 112 irst, she launches into a
speech about how difficult ii is to diagnose anorexia, l hen, she
explains that anorexia cannot be caused by any one influence,
finally, she admits that the book paints a pretty good picture of
her parents. When I ask how her relationship with her parents is
now, her one-line response is. "Very different from when I was
I 1." F.nd of discussion.
I "his is one of several topics that, though relevant and interest
ing, (iottlieb firmly refuses to discuss. I guess this is somewhat
exc usable when you consider that she is, after all, simply a Stan
ford medical student w ho dec ided to open some of her most per
sonal thoughts to the world.
"I thought it was important to put out there because I had the
original source material and there was nothing really like it . . . It's
[ written during! the age before you start censoring your thoughts."
At I 1 years old, (iottlieb explains, girls don't yet have abstract
thinking, so they are strictly logical. They see the paradoxes found
in media messages, like iu a magazine with a recipe for cookies on
one page and a diet plan telling you never to eat those cookies on
the next. Meanwhile, an older girl may be so absorbed in the cul
ture that she no longer notices these mixed messages.
"Stick 112 igure" is unique because it presents the thoughts of an
1 1-year-old anorexic girl almost entirely as she experienced them
at the time, (iottlieb says that she had no motivation to write an
anorexia memoir, an approach which has already been used time
and time again. Rather, she wanted to "preserve the voice" that she
naturally had as an I 1 -year-old writing iu her diary, keeping "Stick
112 igure" authentic to those diary entries.
(iottlieb claims that she limited her present involvement to an
"edit job," piec ing the dian entries together into a cohesive narra
tive, omitting irrelevant details, and including "anything that moti

vated what was going on, in terms of my behavior."
Yet, even if she doesn't openly admit it, it seems pretty clear that
at the very least, some transitions, as well as the storybook ending
("Because I sort of do feel different now. And maybe what's differ
ent is that I kind of think there's nothing wrong with being differ
ent in the first place. . ."), are simply too mature and too well
thought out to have been written in an 11-year-old's diary. More
over, in certain parts of the book, the undernourished narrator is
barely able to stand up without fainting from lack of energy. It
seems quite unlikely that this same narrator then had the energy
to meticulously document that experience. The consensus among
readers with whom I have spoken is that "Stick Figure" is the high
ly successful attempt of an adult to write an interesting, socially rel
evant story that is directly based on her childhood diary.
Regardless of its authenticity, it can still be a shocking experience
when something as personal as a diary is suddenly "out there,"
available to anyone with $22 to drop. Yet, Gottlieb feels protected
by the universality of her experiences. "I don't feel as naked out
there because I think everyone sees their own experience in my
experience," she explains. People reading the story see it as a com
ing of age tale of young women in general, not as "the Lori (iot
tlieb story. Because who really cares what the Lori (iottlieb story
is," she asks me, ironically, the week before she is scheduled to tell
that story on "Entertainment Tonight."
(iottlieb hopes that as people learn more about anorexia, the uni
versal story can have a different plot, one with no place for eating
disorders. "I think prevention is really important in creating some
kind of awareness about these issues and in preventing girls from
going down that path," she says.
But, contrary to current medical theories, Gottlieb feels that even
if girls have started down that path, it is not too late. "There's a
theory in medicine that one can never recover from anorexia, that
it's like alcoholism . . . the potential for problems is always there. I
take issue with that because I am fully recovered," she explains.
(iottlieb dedicates time to helping other disordered girls recover
and learn to be comfortable with their bodies. Through Stanford
medical school, she speaks to patients, support groups, and stu
dents. One issue she hopes to emphasize is the distinction between
health and image. "1 wish . . . the norm would be that we eat
healthy food and we exercise because we want to be healthy, [not
to look] like some unrealistic ideal that is dangerous. It's not so
much about whether [girls] get very skinny. It's about how com
fortable do they feel in their own skin. And it's very hard for
women, given the pressures that surround them, to feel comfort
able in their bodies."
I lopef ully, by exposing the universality of these issues, Gottlieb's
book can help women to feel more comfortable. At the very least,
now they know that their experiences are not unique.
Perhaps Gottlieb's storybook ending says it best after all. In our
liposuction society that endorses the philosophy, "You can never
be too rich or too thin," Gottlieb writes. "I kind of think there's
nothing wrong with being different in the first place. I mean, it's
possible, isn't it?"

or to grow past the si/e at which it stopped being

(iottlieb was I I when she developed the eating
disorder, which is characteri/ed bv a preocc n pat ion
with dieting and thinness, an altered bod\ image,
and excessive weight loss. As her weight plummet

starying. emaciated girl intended to elicit pit\ and

During this time, (iottlieb — now a first-year
Stanford medical student — c archills recorded liei
thoughts and feelings in her diary. Twenty-two
years later, she published an edited version ol the
diar\ as the book "Stick Figure."

It can be hard to identify what is disordered, per
se. because our culture seems to push women in
that diree lion. (iottlieb savs. " \lllhe feedback I had
been getting |inunediateb prioi to cle\elo|)ing

and not running around like the guvs. And the\
shouldn't be eating dessert. And thc\ should be

offhand comments like "she's got lluindei thighs,
or compliments that a woman tna\ receive foi los

may feel cultural pressure to be thin — at am cost.

What's worse is tli.it people don't realize how early girls start tak
ing in that information. "And they're going to use that as a foun
dation lor how the\ view themselves lot the rest of tlieit lives,
unless something comes in to < liange that," Gottlieb explains.
Recent l\, (.ottlieh leai tied exa< 11 \ how one particular I 1-year-old
felt when confronted with these cultural pressures. After she

her I I ill birthdav, onl\ months before she would face her battle
with anorexia. Inspired b\ " I he I)i.ir\ of Anne Frank," she poured
hei heart out into the lam \, gold-trimmed book, detailing her pri
vate thoughts and feelings.
l wenl\ wars later, Gottlieb, now completely past hei eating dis
order. saw something universal in those meticulously documented
experiences, something to which all women could relate. She
dest t ibes it as "the words of an II -year-old [about] what it's like . .
. in our culture to go through that transition from being a girl to
being a woman, when the roles change . . . and all of a sudden this
emphasis on how von look and how von at t and how you behave
becomes paramount."
Spurred on In reactions from women and aided by connections
within the writing indnstrv, Gottlieb decided to edit her diaries
into a cohesive narrative and publish tlieni. Since its publication,
"Stitk Figure" has been receiving .1 landslide of media attention,
(■ottlieh has been featured on such programs as "Fntertaininent
l onight, "Good Morning America,"and "Fecza," and her hook
was just optioned lor film by Martin Scorsese.
'St it k Figure" is an interesting read; as the < harismatic narrator
slowly takes us tleep into the disordered world of anorexia, we
watch her slowly niorph from .1 normal, mildly rebellious girl into
an obsessive calorie-counter, a girl who feels compelled to deceive
everyone about how ninth she eats. At one point, while getting a
Gl scan, which would let doctors observe her intestines, she is
forced to drink a pink fluid. Her distorted thinking is never more
blatant than when she asks the doctors to tell her exactly when the
pink fluid is converted into fat so she can watch it happen. At times
childlike, insightful, humorous, and even pathetic, "Stick Figure"
is an enlightening look at a pervasive problem in our culture.
Gottlieb isn't too surprised that people are taking notice of her
book. "Basically, evervbody who is female has responded to this in
some way," she explains. "Because I don't know a woman on the
planet who hasn't questioned whether or not she looks fat."
A former Hollywood executive, Gottlieb is a smooth talker with
a voice and face reminiscent of Beet a from "Fife Goes On," and
she knows exactly what she wants to see printed in this story.
Before we talk, her publishers send me a copy of suggested ques

lions, which, though I never directh ask any of them, I notice she
somehow manages i<> completeh address. ()n my way out, she
gives me a copv ol a previoush written stor\ about her that she
liked.
Sitting at her dining room table, she takes up about a quarter of
her (hail as she leans into the corner between the chair and the
kitchen counter behind her. She rests her left arm on the counter,
keeping her hand in her straight dark hair as we talk, as if holding
it back from her face. As she nods hei head in recognition of an

(iottlieb was I I when she developed the eating

with dieting and thinness, an altered bod\ image,
and excessive weight loss. As her weight plummet

more distorted. At one point, she would hold liei

starying. emaciated girl intended to elicit pit\ and

During this time, (iottlieb — now a first-year
Stanford medical student — c archills recorded liei
thoughts and feelings in her diary. Twenty-two
years later, she published an edited version ol the
diar\ as the book "Stick Figure."

It can be hard to identify what is disordered, per
se. because our culture seems to push women in
that diree lion. (iottlieb savs. " \lllhe feedback I had

and not running around like the guvs. And the\
shouldn't be eating dessert. And thc\ should be

She points out thai the media also piesents unre
alistic images ol women. W hen that gels added to
offhand comments like "she's got lluindei thighs,
or compliments that a woman tna\ receive foi los
ing weight, it's not so difficult to see how a woman
may feel cultural pressure to be thin — at am cost.

What's worse is tli.it people don't realize how early girls start tak
ing in that information. "And they're going to use that as a foun
dation lor how the\ view themselves lot the rest of tlieit lives,
unless something comes in to < liange that," Gottlieb explains.
Recent l\, (.ottlieh leai tied exa< 11 \ how one particular I 1-year-old
felt when confronted with these cultural pressures. After she
decided to appl\ to medical st hool, (lottlieb went hack to her child
hood home to look loi some old ( heniistry notes and instead stnm
hled upon hei diar\. She had received the diary as a present for
her I I ill birthdav, onl\ months before she would face her battle
with anorexia. Inspired b\ " I he I)i.ir\ of Anne Frank," she poured
hei heart out into the lam \, gold-trimmed book, detailing her pri
vate thoughts and feelings.
l wenl\ wars later, Gottlieb, now completely past hei eating dis
order. saw something universal in those meticulously documented
experiences, something to which all women could relate. She
dest t ibes it as "the words of an II -year-old [about] what it's like . .
. in our culture to go through that transition from being a girl to
being a woman, when the roles change . . . and all of a sudden this
emphasis on how von look and how von at t and how you behave
becomes paramount."
Spurred on In reactions from women and aided by connections
within the writing indnstrv, Gottlieb decided to edit her diaries
into a cohesive narrative and publish tlieni. Since its publication,
"Stitk Figure" has been receiving .1 landslide of media attention,
(■ottlieh has been featured on such programs as "Fntertaininent
l onight, "Good Morning America,"and "Fecza," and her hook
was just optioned lor film by Martin Scorsese.
'St it k Figure" is an interesting read; as the < harismatic narrator
slowly takes us tleep into the disordered world of anorexia, we
watch her slowly niorph from .1 normal, mildly rebellious girl into
an obsessive calorie-counter, a girl who feels compelled to deceive
everyone about how ninth she eats. At one point, while getting a
Gl scan, which would let doctors observe her intestines, she is
forced to drink a pink fluid. Her distorted thinking is never more
blatant than when she asks the doctors to tell her exactly when the
pink fluid is converted into fat so she can watch it happen. At times
childlike, insightful, humorous, and even pathetic, "Stick Figure"
is an enlightening look at a pervasive problem in our culture.
Gottlieb isn't too surprised that people are taking notice of her
book. "Basically, evervbody who is female has responded to this in
some way," she explains. "Because I don't know a woman on the
planet who hasn't questioned whether or not she looks fat."
A former Hollywood executive, Gottlieb is a smooth talker with
a voice and face reminiscent of Beet a from "Fife Goes On," and
she knows exactly what she wants to see printed in this story.
Before we talk, her publishers send me a copy of suggested ques

lions, which, though I never directh ask any of them, I notice she
somehow manages i<> completeh address. ()n my way out, she
gives me a copv ol a previoush written stor\ about her that she
liked.
Sitting at her dining room table, she takes up about a quarter of
her (hail as she leans into the corner between the chair and the
kitchen counter behind her. She rests her left arm on the counter,
keeping her hand in her straight dark hair as we talk, as if holding
it back from her face. As she nods hei head in recognition of an
acceptable question, 1 notice that it feels slightl) awkward to con
verse with her. I reali/e later that this is because many of my ques
tions go unanswered, serving instead as vehicles for her to redirect
the conversation back where she wants it.
()ne topic that I particularly wanted to discuss was (iottlieb's par
ents. One of the most stunning elements in "Stick Figure" is the
consistentlv selfish, uncaring, and immature manner in which (iot
tlieb's mother treats her. References to her eating disorder as
something Gottlieb is doing to her mother, alongside comments
like-, " I he pain only begins with childbirth," epitomize the ego
centric mentalitN held In (lottlieb's mother. (lottlieb's father
doesn't come ac ross as am more caring, though his shortcomings
as a parent are less blatant.
Spurred on In the reactions of Other readers, I inquire into (iot
tlieb's current feelings about her parents, 112 irst, she launches into a
speech about how difficult ii is to diagnose anorexia, l hen, she
explains that anorexia cannot be caused by any one influence,
finally, she admits that the book paints a pretty good picture of
her parents. When I ask how her relationship with her parents is
now, her one-line response is. "Very different from when I was
I 1." F.nd of discussion.
I "his is one of several topics that, though relevant and interest
ing, (iottlieb firmly refuses to discuss. I guess this is somewhat
exc usable when you consider that she is, after all, simply a Stan
ford medical student w ho dec ided to open some of her most per
sonal thoughts to the world.
"I thought it was important to put out there because I had the
original source material and there was nothing really like it . . . It's
[ written during! the age before you start censoring your thoughts."
At I 1 years old, (iottlieb explains, girls don't yet have abstract
thinking, so they are strictly logical. They see the paradoxes found
in media messages, like iu a magazine with a recipe for cookies on
one page and a diet plan telling you never to eat those cookies on
the next. Meanwhile, an older girl may be so absorbed in the cul
ture that she no longer notices these mixed messages.
"Stick 112 igure" is unique because it presents the thoughts of an
1 1-year-old anorexic girl almost entirely as she experienced them
at the time, (iottlieb says that she had no motivation to write an
anorexia memoir, an approach which has already been used time
and time again. Rather, she wanted to "preserve the voice" that she
naturally had as an I 1 -year-old writing iu her diary, keeping "Stick
112 igure" authentic to those diary entries.
(iottlieb claims that she limited her present involvement to an
"edit job," piec ing the dian entries together into a cohesive narra
tive, omitting irrelevant details, and including "anything that moti

vated what was going on, in terms of my behavior."
Yet, even if she doesn't openly admit it, it seems pretty clear that
at the very least, some transitions, as well as the storybook ending
("Because I sort of do feel different now. And maybe what's differ
ent is that I kind of think there's nothing wrong with being differ
ent in the first place. . ."), are simply too mature and too well
thought out to have been written in an 11-year-old's diary. More
over, in certain parts of the book, the undernourished narrator is
barely able to stand up without fainting from lack of energy. It
seems quite unlikely that this same narrator then had the energy
to meticulously document that experience. The consensus among
readers with whom I have spoken is that "Stick Figure" is the high
ly successful attempt of an adult to write an interesting, socially rel
evant story that is directly based on her childhood diary.
Regardless of its authenticity, it can still be a shocking experience
when something as personal as a diary is suddenly "out there,"
available to anyone with $22 to drop. Yet, Gottlieb feels protected
by the universality of her experiences. "I don't feel as naked out
there because I think everyone sees their own experience in my
experience," she explains. People reading the story see it as a com
ing of age tale of young women in general, not as "the Lori (iot
tlieb story. Because who really cares what the Lori (iottlieb story
is," she asks me, ironically, the week before she is scheduled to tell
that story on "Entertainment Tonight."
(iottlieb hopes that as people learn more about anorexia, the uni
versal story can have a different plot, one with no place for eating
disorders. "I think prevention is really important in creating some
kind of awareness about these issues and in preventing girls from
going down that path," she says.
But, contrary to current medical theories, Gottlieb feels that even
if girls have started down that path, it is not too late. "There's a
theory in medicine that one can never recover from anorexia, that
it's like alcoholism . . . the potential for problems is always there. I
take issue with that because I am fully recovered," she explains.
(iottlieb dedicates time to helping other disordered girls recover
and learn to be comfortable with their bodies. Through Stanford
medical school, she speaks to patients, support groups, and stu
dents. One issue she hopes to emphasize is the distinction between
health and image. "1 wish . . . the norm would be that we eat
healthy food and we exercise because we want to be healthy, [not
to look] like some unrealistic ideal that is dangerous. It's not so
much about whether [girls] get very skinny. It's about how com
fortable do they feel in their own skin. And it's very hard for
women, given the pressures that surround them, to feel comfort
able in their bodies."
I lopef ully, by exposing the universality of these issues, Gottlieb's
book can help women to feel more comfortable. At the very least,
now they know that their experiences are not unique.
Perhaps Gottlieb's storybook ending says it best after all. In our
liposuction society that endorses the philosophy, "You can never
be too rich or too thin," Gottlieb writes. "I kind of think there's
nothing wrong with being different in the first place. I mean, it's
possible, isn't it?"
