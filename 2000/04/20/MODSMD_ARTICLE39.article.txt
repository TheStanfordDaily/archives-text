## Days a touching comedy 
### MICHAEL BAER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"'JS Days' i> (lie type of film that — although no great
work — aehieves the difficult balance between a serious
subject and comedy. As su< li, it is an engaging and enter
taining romp through the not-so-light world of substance
abuse and recovery.
In rough flash bat ks, we see and leel the boo/.ed-up,
drugged-up, manic lile (iwen ( aimniings (played by San
dra Bullock) leads, along with her boyfriend jasper
(Dominic West). I he thrills and dangers are (juite appar
ent . Living life as a glorified mess, though, finally comes
to an end when, under the influence, (iwen ruins the
wedding reception of hei sister l.ily (Kli/abeth Perkins,
"Big"), not to inention an unlucky bvstandei s house <ind
the honevmoon limo.
(iwen is faced with rehab 01 jail, neither

of which (iwen iliinks suits her. Once
thrown into rehab — which seems like ;t
hippie hell to her — she tries desperately
to claw her wav out, quite literally at one
point. But, of course, she's eventuallv
made to "fit in" with various real-life
archetypes: hei sugar-obsessed, teen

addict roommate, Andrea (A/ura Skye); the not-so
sinooth movei and losei Olivet (Michael O'Mallev); and
the effeminate dancer and cokehead, (ierhardt (Alan
I lidyk), among other patients. I here's also counselor
Cornell (Steve Buscenii), a former addict, there to help
them all straighten up and f1 \ right.
Not that that's easy, with either the culture clash or per
sonal clashes which ensue. Oi the fact that boyfriend
|asper seems, after a time, to be bad foi (iwen in spite of
ob\ iousl) possessing .1 good beat 1 and a real love for her.
She also hits to deal will) hei familv s role in this, that of
her addictive mother and neglectful sister. And the pres
sures of dealing with instrue live and destruclive peers.
However, iu spite of the serious subject matter, things
are dealt with with a fait bil of levity, as one would sus
pect might be necessary lo survive such a harrowing
experience. Patients trv to find solace not only through
reflection, praver, support and song, but

through soap operas and cand\.
I lic\ also use other darker and forbid
den tin ills, like c utting and sex. So it's not
