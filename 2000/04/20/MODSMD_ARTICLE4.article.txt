# GSC election stresses housing
## 
### ELISABETH PRESSER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Candidates running for the
Craduate Student Council in the
ASSL elections, which conclude
at midnight, are stressing advoca
cy issues such as housing and
childcare as well as issues relating
to graduate social life as central
concerns for the campaign.
I he CSC was formed last year
In a Constitutional amendment as
an official, separate ASSU body.

Twelve candidates are currently
running for 15 available seats in
the CSC. One member is elected
to represent each of the schools
along with five "at-large" council
members.
At present, the School of Medi
cine, the School of Humanities
and the School of Kducation are
not represented by the running
candidates.
Chris Stroniberg, a doctoral
student in chemistry who is run
ning for the CSC, said he is not
concerned about this lack of rep
resentation.
"We really want all the schools
represented," he said, saying,
however, that "formally elected
people don't mattei so much."
"We have mechanisms for
adding people." Stroniberg
added.
|(>lln Mills, a doctoral student
in genetics and vice president of
the ASS I , said, "There have al
w«i\s been people who have been
actively involved [in the (iS(!] who
weren't elected as CSC mem
bers."
Current CSC Chair kaleb
Midland, .i doctoral student in
physics who is also running, said
he was certain "people will be
written in" on the ballot who have
not announced their candidacv.

► Midland s;iid I hat die biggest
issues tor the (.SC. would contin
ue to be housing and stipends.
(graduate students are concerned
about basic c|iiestions of "where
they are going to eat and sleep,"
he said.
I Midland pointed to the dispar
ity between administrative atten
tion to undergraduate and gradu
ate housing needs.
"It would be nice ifftlie admin
istration | could put the same
amount of energy into getting
graduate student housing," he
said.
Law School student ly Cle
venger, a (iS( 1 candidate, said that
in the area of housing "the prob
lem is not really Stanford per se.
Hie administration has been very
proactive. I he biggest obstacle
[toward improvements in gradu
ate student housing] is the couti
ty."
Students "must get active," Cle

venger said, in the pushing the
county to approve Stanford's
General Use Permit, which would
allow for the const nut ion of addi
tional graduate housing on cam
pus.
C >S( 1 candidate Anialia Miller, a
doctoral student in economics,
said of the housing issue, "Prob
lems that can't be solved tjuit kl\
gel pushed aside. The (>S(' has a
role in keeping that issue on the
table."
Along with housing, childcare
is an important advocacy issue for
the GSC. Stroniberg said that
graduate students who need child
care have to spend considerable
time 011 waiting lists.
Sanjay Rant hod, another GSC
candidate and a Law School stu
dent, said that the programs that
are available for students are pro
hibitively expensive and incove
nient.
Clevenger is concerned with
getting students involved in the
Board of Trustees. He said that
"faculty and students could give
important insight" to the Board's
activities which may be missing
from current deliberations.

Importance of
social life highlighted
Another area of foe ns lot (iS( 1
canditatcs is in social events and
at tivities lor graduate students.
Miller said that a significant
problem impeding graduate so
cial life is the difficulty in publiciz
ing events. She said she wanted to
"improve, possibb expand the
(IS(e-mail list" and "use the (iS( i
Web site and update it more Ire
cjnent 1\ in order to publicize
graduate student events.
(iraduatcstudenls have unique
social needs, she said, but they
dearly have a desire to be involved
iu a conununitv. " I lie proof of the
pudding is in the eating," she said.
"When the (1S( 1 plans events, peo
ple do come."
Kani hod said, " 1 here aren't
enough structures in place to
bring graduate students togeth
er." He said that students in dif
ferent schools would benefit from
more interaction in both social
and academic capacities.
'There are so many amazing
people at Stanford. I just think we
should get to know each other,"
he added.

Clevenger said of graduate so
cial life, "I don't think it's the pri
mary issue for the (ISC. I think
there are a lot more nuts and bolls
issues." ( levcnger pointed to bicy
cle traffic and academic integrity
as issues of greater concern for the
(;sc :.
Two key issues overlap
Mills said that issues of advoca
cy and social life are interrelated.
"'l'lie main mission oft he (iSCI is to
make things better for graduate
students," he said. "Priority one
would have to be a place to live,
but at the same time you want to
go beyond the bare essentials."
Mills said that the greatest chal
lenge for the C»S(. is motivating
graduate students to become in
volved in the graduate communi
ty. "You're competeing not only
with communication problems
but also with the fact I hat graduate

Along with housing, childcare
is an important advocacy issue for
the GSC. Stroniberg said that
graduate students who need child
care have to spend considerable
time 011 waiting lists.
Sanjay Rant hod, another GSC
candidate and a Law School stu
dent, said that the programs that
are available for students are pro
hibitively expensive and incove
nient.
Clevenger is concerned with
getting students involved in the
Board of Trustees. He said that
"faculty and students could give
important insight" to the Board's
activities which may be missing
from current deliberations.

Importance of
social life highlighted
Another area of foe ns lot (iS( 1
canditatcs is in social events and
at tivities lor graduate students.
Miller said that a significant
problem impeding graduate so
cial life is the difficulty in publiciz
ing events. She said she wanted to
"improve, possibb expand the
(IS(e-mail list" and "use the (iS( i
Web site and update it more Ire
cjnent 1\ in order to publicize
graduate student events.
(iraduatcstudenls have unique
social needs, she said, but they
dearly have a desire to be involved
iu a conununitv. " I lie proof of the
pudding is in the eating," she said.
"When the (1S( 1 plans events, peo
ple do come."
Kani hod said, " 1 here aren't
enough structures in place to
bring graduate students togeth
er." He said that students in dif
ferent schools would benefit from
more interaction in both social
and academic capacities.
'There are so many amazing
people at Stanford. I just think we
should get to know each other,"
he added.

Clevenger said of graduate so
cial life, "I don't think it's the pri
mary issue for the (ISC. I think
there are a lot more nuts and bolls
issues." ( levcnger pointed to bicy
cle traffic and academic integrity
as issues of greater concern for the
(;sc :.
Two key issues overlap
Mills said that issues of advoca
cy and social life are interrelated.
"'l'lie main mission oft he (iSCI is to
make things better for graduate
students," he said. "Priority one
would have to be a place to live,
but at the same time you want to
go beyond the bare essentials."
Mills said that the greatest chal
lenge for the C»S(. is motivating
graduate students to become in
volved in the graduate communi
ty. "You're competeing not only
with communication problems
but also with the fact I hat graduate
students have a lot going on."
Michaucl said that although not
all graduate students agree with
him, he believes that issues of
housing and < bilelc are advocacy
and social programming are
"equally important" to the (iSC.
