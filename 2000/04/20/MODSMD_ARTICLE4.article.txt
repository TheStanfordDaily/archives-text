### ELISABETH PRESSER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Candidates running for the
Craduate Student Council in the
ASSL elections, which conclude
at midnight, are stressing advoca
cy issues such as housing and
childcare as well as issues relating
to graduate social life as central
concerns for the campaign.
I he CSC was formed last year
In a Constitutional amendment as
an official, separate ASSU body.

Twelve candidates are currently
running for 15 available seats in
the CSC. One member is elected
to represent each of the schools
along with five "at-large" council
members.
At present, the School of Medi
cine, the School of Humanities
and the School of Kducation are
not represented by the running
candidates.
Chris Stroniberg, a doctoral
student in chemistry who is run
ning for the CSC, said he is not
concerned about this lack of rep
resentation.
"We really want all the schools
represented," he said, saying,
however, that "formally elected
people don't mattei so much."
"We have mechanisms for
adding people." Stroniberg
added.
|(>lln Mills, a doctoral student
in genetics and vice president of
the ASS I , said, "There have al
wÂ«i\s been people who have been
actively involved [in the (iS(!] who
weren't elected as CSC mem
bers."
Current CSC Chair kaleb
Midland, .i doctoral student in
physics who is also running, said
he was certain "people will be
written in" on the ballot who have
not announced their candidacv.
