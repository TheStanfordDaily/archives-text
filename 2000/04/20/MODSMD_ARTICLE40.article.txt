# No payoff in 'Money'
## 
### DANIEL MOREAU 
Although i he rohhi'i's in "When* I lie Monc\
Is" do eventually find the loot, the studio
executives may lincl themselves asking
"Where is the money?" — so poor is the dia
logue and so unlikely the plot. I his eclectic
group of criminals is com prised ol an old pro
in Henry (played bv Paul Newman) and a
novice couple in Carol and Wavne (Linda
l iorentino and Dermot Mulroney).
(larol, a nurse in a kooky old age home,
and Wayne, who can find only night work,
have been on a downward slope ever since
they were prom royalty. Kilter Henry, a life
less convicted hank robber being transferred
from a prison hospital to the nursing home
where (larol works.
Ridit ulouslv, it is 30 minutes into the movie
before (larol finds out that I lent) is faking
his paralysis, just waiting lot his chance to
escape. I his suspense — when will Heinv
wake up? — is ineffective and gratuitous, as
it is hard to < onccivc ol a mov ie in which the
lead actor is brain-dead lot its entire dura
(larol goes as tai as perloi ming a lap dance
foi Ilenrv in ordei to arouse some life in
liiiu, but she has to resort to othei methods.
And altci Ilenrv s forced awakening from
his inert state, the dialogue bee oincs (lithe as
11ci Irv sighs in the vein of all tough guvs: "I
need a drink."
(larol is somehow convinced that perform
inj; a heist with her husband will improve
theii relationship and rest tie her from the
dreariness ol Small 1 '<iwn I SA. "You want to
save vour marriage b\ robbing a bank,"
Ilenrv sa\s with bewilderment. "Wli.it you
need is a priest." I his is the onlv way we
learn of Carol's motivation lor wanting to
break the law.
I lent v and (larol linallv agree on hijacking
an armored cat altei its first pit k-up and
completing the remainder ol its route them
selves with the aitl of Carol's husband
Wayne. I lie plot meanders when Wayne
suspects (larol ol (heating on him with

I he last hall liom ol this mcrcifullv short
movie follows these would be robbers from
pick-up to pick-up, in a feeble attempt to
build suspense. Predictably, there are a cou
ple ol t lost * talis, but nothing that gets the
audience breathing hard, as llenn's sell
possession and Carol's resourcefulness
defuse one i isk\ situation after anolhet.
With theii respective go(»tI looks, l iorenti
