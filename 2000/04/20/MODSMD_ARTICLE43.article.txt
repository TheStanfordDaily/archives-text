# Irish drama edges towards overkill

Alcoholism. Poverty. Abuse. Sex
ually corrupt priests. Drinking.
Insanity. More drinking. As il
Irish drama weren't dreary
enough, wunderkind playwright
Martin Mt Donagh insists on
adding insult io injur) by making
the leaf! character in bis 1997 play
a (i ipple. And not just any kind ol
tripple, but an unattractive trip
pic, mind you.
McDonagh is Ireland's 29-year
old star of the moment. Fresh oil
the success ol " I be Beauty Queen
<>l Lectiane," he wrote " I he ('.rip
ple of Inislunaan," another play
set in the Aran Islands oil the < oast
of Western Ireland. I le's been
called .1 purist by some critics, a
mixture ol |.M. Synge and Sean
O'Casey, and a true return to the
conventional foi ins of drama.
"Cripple" is a play that creeps
slowb towards its climax. Secrets
merge with gossip in the town of
Inislunaan iu 191V4, where Clippie
Billy (Travis Ingle) limps around
watching cattle and waiting to be
kissed. He lives with two "aunts,"
Kale (l'hoebc Mover) and Eileen

(Elizabeth Benedict), ever since his
parents mysteriously died or killed
themselves when he was born.
Johnny pat een mike (Edward
Saralian) is the town's newsman,
running door to door to spread
nonsense, boring trilles, or com
mon knowledge in exchange for
some food. He's also trying to
drink his mother (Barbara Rich
mond) to death.
But on this day, Johnnypateen
mike has some real news to share.
Famous American film director
Robert Flaherty is coming to the
neighboring island ol Inishmorc
to film his documentary "The Man
ol Aran," and he's looking for
Irish characters ol all soils to star
in it.
Enter the drama: Cripple Billy
wants more than anything to go to
America. So he lakes having tuber
culosis and convinces the town's
lough guy Babbybobby (Mark
Phillips) to row him over to Inisli
more on bis boat. Crude and vul
gar Slippy Helen (Sarah Over
man) and her brother Bartley
(Zane Allen) accompany them on
the waters. But when Billy gets
taken to Hollywood for a screen
test, questions are left unan

swered, betrayals are unleashed,
and Act Two begins.
As the closing show of Theatre
works' season, "Cripple" simulta
neously moves and delights with
out ever packing a real emotional
punch. This is partly the fault of
director Robert Kelley and his
somewhat uneven cast, and per
haps McDonagh himself even
deserves a jot of blame. T his is not
to say that "Cripple" is not a fine
piece of theater, which it certainly
is, it just could have been a lot
finer.
Fngle's Cripple just isn't pathet
ic enough. He limps around the
stage with too much ease; there's
not nearly enough pain and long
ing in bis mangled gestures and
body. His speech is too confident
and assured for an audience to
feel much sympathy for him. It's a
tricky part to play, and unfortu
nately one that c an make or break
the show.
( Herman's shocking I felen is the
true treat of the evening, and
Sarafian's hilarious and touching
Johnnypateenmike follows behind
as a c lose second. Phillips' Babby
bobby is the evening's other
knockout, a sensitive bully at the

breaking point.
McDonagh hasn't made tilings
easy for director Kelley. "Cripple"
is an odd mixture of wicked come
dy and very serious drama. In Kel
ley's hands, the drama has the ten
dency to slip into dripping senti
mentality. Often, the piece lacks
balance, and Kelley clearly leels
more comfortable with the comic
than tragic. Key moments, like the
discovery of what happened to
Billy's parents, are glossed over,
and an audience can never get
truly emotionally attached to these
characters for this reason.
For the most part though, The
atreworks has concocted a fine
presentation of Irish drama that is
a pleasure to watch on Eric E.
Sinkkonen's gorgeous set. Enjoy
the drama, but leave the Kleenex
at home. You won't need it this
time around.
