# Wild dinner show is worth all the dough
## 
### LAUREN RUSSELL EDITORIAL STAFF 
Teatro Xinzanni is an unusual mixture
of Cirque tlu Soleil performance art, the
surreal silliness of a Fellini film and the
I bod of a nice restaurant. I lie dinner
show, which is held in a traditional Bel
gian tent (a "spiegeltent"), and is a self
described feast of "love, chaos, and din
ner," is playing at Pier 29 on the Fmbar
cadero in San Francisco.
Cuests arrive in the lusciously deco
rated red velvet lobby, and hors d'oeu
vres and drinks are served while the
inostly-yuppie-looking group of
schmoo/ers wait to be seated. What the
audience does not realize at first is that
the entire stall is part of the show. 1 he
Woniaii st'iVifvg you Svine may later con

tort her body into almost disgustingly
odd shapes, while the man who brings
you a napkin will later juggle tables and
people with his feet.
The performance itself (which will
make you laugh food all over your
feather boa — eccentric costumes are
the norm for the audience) is absolutely
incredible. Within a small yet exquisite
mirrored tent, contortionists, acrobats,
magicians, and comedians will wow you.
I he dinner is interspersed with these
circus-like performances and also with a
wonderful jazz singer, an opera perfor
mance, and the character of the cook,
who is the best part of the show, in my
opinion. The cook introduces each
course transformed into a different
character every time — the soup is
brought in by a Christian evangelist, the

salad by a Spanish bull-fighter, and the
main dish by a sexy gang moll who is
pulled right out of Hollywood with her
squeaky voice and spunky attitude.
This show is truly a supreme sensory
stimulation — music, comedy, drama,
oddities, and constant, chaotic activity.
And while the food itself is not amazing,
there was certainly a clear amount of
attention paid to detail in cooking it.
The salad was an odd mix of dandelion
greens and unidentified edible objects.
The main course was "cabernet chit ken
chasseur," although I had the vegetari
an option, which was zucchini stufled
with lentils — a surprisingly delicious
dish. Fhe lemon-strawberry souffle tor
dessert was decadantly rich, and the
soup was also a heavy, cream-based
cheese concoction entitled "roasted fen

nel and parsnip with a checklar into."
Nobody goes to Teatro Zinzanni lor
the food, though. Ihe show will make
you waver between laughing hysterical
ly and sitting in awe for close to four
hours, which few performances are
capable of. Tickets are expensive, but
worth it. If you want to impress some
one, or more importantly, if you want to
spoil yourself, splurge and book a table.
You will go home at the end of the
evening completely blown away.
