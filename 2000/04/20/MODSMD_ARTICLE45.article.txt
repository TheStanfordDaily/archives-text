# Poor direction, acting make 'Holiday' a play to avoid
## 
### MONYA DE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Right before a production of Philip Barry's com
edy "Holiday," the self-deprecating artistic direc
tor of the Northside Theatre Company made an
appearance in which lie requested cell phones to
be turned off and reminded the audience that it
was "okay to laugh."
It was a good thing he said so, because it would
have been easy to forget. For a company that has
been around as long as Northside has (22 years)
one would expect a more refined production and
more thoughtful direction. Instead, Northside
takes a script that takes too long to get to the point
and zooms through it to compensate.
"Holiday," set in 1938, centers around the secret
lovers Julia Seton (Sandra Gigliotti) and Johnny
Case (Matt Olsem). They form the classic poor boy
/ rich girl couple, and a main source of conflict is
the problem of getting approval from Julia s
father (Craig Engen). Julia's sister Linda (Maria
Biber-Ferro) tells Mr. Seton all about Johnny, but
Seton pretends not to know anything about the
engagement. Meanwhile, Linda plans a New
Year's Eve party for the official announcement of
the news, and Johnny begins to have doubts about

life and love. In a modern side
note, he has hit it big in the
stock market and anticipates a
temporary retirement at 30.
Barry's script is really several
stories in one. It can't decide
which of its many characters to
focus on, and as such several of
them disappear for so long that

the audience has practically forgotten them.
Linda and Johnny's parallel discontent is awk
wardly executed, and the comedy comes in fits
and starts rather than being the purpose of the

play. A comedy of quips and one-liners needs to
he well-balanced with the serious material in the
script as well as being delivered with impeccable
timing. Neither is accomplished here. Olsetn, in
particular, rushes through every single one of his
lines iu the first act, ruining many perfectly good
jokes, bui everyone in the cast has problems with
timing at some point.
The women of "Holiday" are the only reason to
watch it. (iigliotli as Julia exhibits a warmth and
variety of facial expressions that makes Olsetn
look even more wooden. Richard Orlando's direc
tion of their interaction is incomprehensible; whv
does Johnny keep running to the other side of the
living room to talk to his future wife? Why does
she push him aside after one kiss following a sep
aration?
Biber-Ferro, as Linda, also makes the most of
her role. She is believable as the frustrated future
society woman who just wants a "holiday." She
seems to have the* brightest future in acting, with
head-turning good looks, versatility, and tlu 1 abil
ity to deliver jokes well. Debra Gatlin Townley's
amusing Laura Cram adds another source of
much-needed energy to the production.
For a "black box" type of theater (it only seats
about 40), Orlando's multi-tiered set design is

quite elegant, and props are
used creatively throughout. The
multicultural cast was also a nice
visual surprise. However, much
more could have been done
(and not necessarily at any great
expense) to suggest the festivi
ties at the New Year's Fve party.
With its underdeveloped c har-

acters, babbled lines, and conflicted script, North
side's "Holiday" shouldn't be on your list of
romantic comedies to see. Rent "Four Weddings
and ,\ Funeral" instead.
