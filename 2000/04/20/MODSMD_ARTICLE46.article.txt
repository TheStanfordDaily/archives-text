## Bikini Kill singer takes feminist anger electronic on new album 
### WENDY YAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Le I igre is the latest collaboration
between acclaimed underground pixel
video queen Sadie Benning, artist and
zine-writer Johanna Fateman and Kath
leen Manna — former singer of Bikini
Kill and co-instigator of the early '90s
Riot Grrrl phenomenon. Apparently
these ladies like art. punk and feminist
politics; appropriately. I.e Tigre's songs
deliver a powerful cultural critique of
patriarchal institution against a backdrop
of garagey. stripped-down rhythmic elec
tro-pop. On this record, the ladies com
bine samples, claves. farfisa. a live I)J,
guitar, voices (mostl\ I lanna's) and beats
(I don t think they use real drums) to pro
duce an energetic, dynamic and strange
mix of catchy soul-based synth-beats and
new-wave, with hints of pissed-offedness
throughout.
Listening to the album, I can't help
thinking of what llanna scrawled six
years ago on the album cover for her

short-lived political punk-opera-perfor
mance-art band, The Fakes: "I wanna
infuse pop music with disease cuz it's the
beat that's killing me." Le Tigre actually
falls close to this idea of "diseased" pop
music as the band's music is filled with
both catchy danceable hooks and highly
charged feminist politic, so that it
becomes difficult for the listener to "con
sume" the music's pop-aspect without
noticing the implications of the record's
purposeful flaws, outmoded technologies
and radical, often antagonistic, messages.
I his subversive dismantling of oppressive
dominant culture — or what I lanna calls
"troll-guv reality" — has been her goal
from the start, only now her tactics have
shifted from the more explicit, in-your
lace "feminist rage" of early Bikini Kill
towards a more complicated and expan
sive form of cultural comment in which
political content challenges "the groove."
On "Deceptacon" Manna shrieks
"Wanna disco? Wanna see me disco? /
Let me hear you depoliticize my rhyme,"
over an incongruously new-wavey elee

tro-pop hook in the foreground. The
song's tension between depoliticized
retro pop and its politically frustrated
message is capitulated as Hanna asks,
"Who took the Bomp from the Bom
palompalomp?/ Who took the Ram from
the Ramalamadingdong?" This question
might parallel mainstream culture's
appropriation and cartoonizing of
lianna's own words, as the late '90s took
the "grrr" out of the revolutionary "riot
grrrl" movement and applied the term to
everything from cyber-geeks to Spice
Girls — oh, 1 mean, Grrrls.
But not all the songs are as "angry."
The album covers a lot of ground, wan
dering between "Eau de Bedroom Danc
ing's" spacey guitar-pop ballad of escape
and bedroom dancing (dull!), to the trou
bling ambiguity in "What's Your Take
On Cassavetes," a thumping, groovy
number with messy guitars and trou
bling sing-song dialogue about filmmak
er John Cassavetes ("Genius? Misogy
nist?"). to "Les and Ray's" sweet and
hopeful thank-you note accompanied by

toy piano
sounds. Other
songs are filled
with inspiration
and female
empowerment,
community and
inspiration, as in
"Hot Topic" —
in which '60s
girl-group influ
enced vocals

and bouncy pop chorus gives a partial
roll-call to women who inspire them
("Yoko Ono and Carolee Schneeinan
/You're getting old, that's what they'll
say, but / Don't give a damn I'm listening
anyway").
The band's unique sound appropriates
from a spectrum of musical sources and
styles, including hip-hop, new-wave,
retro-electronic, '60s soul and girl groups,
while manipulating such banal conven
tions and pop clichees into an experimen
tal and potentially radical form.
Throughout this album Le Tigre main

tains a tension that leaves you wondering
whether to dance or to "die bummed,"
and it's via this effective ambiguity that
the band invites a provocative dialogue
with its listeners. Whether you decide to
respond to the music with political action
or bv dancing in
