But if you're expecting more hoi n
heav\ third-wave ska heats and lip-stroke
guitar picking, "Stomping (.round" is
not tor \on. 1 his album is a deliriously

melodic 1 1-song power punch of straight
111> punk rock anthems (plus four extra
songs on a seven inch included with the
liisi 10,000 copies of the album).
I he lirst two tracks, "I'm Down" and
'Tick A fight," rcl\ on traditional frenet
ic punk beats and ( Jiai lie Paulson,s tec h
nicalh superior guitar work to set the
tone for the rest ol the record. Vocalist
John leldtnan lips his wax through
songs like "The laid ol the Day,
responding to his c ritics l>\ pointing out,
"At the end of the clay, I phi) just w hat I
want." and adding, "Vou still need your
mom to pa\ the rent."

Hawaiian-tinged "San Simeon" mixes

tempoed rants about
keeping the music real
no matter where one
might be performing
it.
1 .vi icalh , the album
seems to be speaking

out against detractors of the band who
have criticized them lor allegedh selling
out 01 lilting their sound to match what's
popular. "Stomping Ground" soundly
trashes such arguments: the multitude of
influences that have created (loldfinger's
sound remain evident, while Feldman's
lyrics take no cover in striking out
against anyone who begs to differ.
"If I want to play metal, that's all right
with me," he tells the listener, and
indeed lie's right. Whether (â€¢oldfinger is
paving a tribute to 7 Seconds' classic
cover of "99 Red Balloons" In covering it
themselves, complete with a verse sung
entireh in (ierinan, or whether the band
is singing their onl\ "single" oil of the
record, an irresistibly catcln sing-along
called "Counting the Days," one thing is
clear: "Stomping Ground" belongs in
vour record collection as much as Sean

Connen belongs in
Bond movies pimp
ing women. In both
cases, you're ulti
mateh going to end
up on lop and
extremely satisfied to
boot.
