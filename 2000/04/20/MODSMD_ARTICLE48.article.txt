"I'm Irving i<> push 11 if literal") into
pop [culture]," says author, perfor
mance artist and acioi Harn Yourgrau.
"Hut, to do it in more classical terms with
more elegant \vi iiiug."
In pursuit <>l this goal, \ ourgrau lias
written lour hooks and perlornied spo
ken-word readings ac ross thi' country,
inc hiding performances on Ml\ and
NPR. His third hook, "The Sadness of
Sex," was adapted into a movie in which
Yourgrau starred opposite I'eta Wilson,
television's "I.a l euiine Nikita. I lie film
was shown at several festivals, including
the Sundance festival and the \ahoo
Film Festival, and is currentl\ enjoying a
second life courles\ ol ifilni.coni, where
it can he downloaded in discrete
episodes until \pi il -'»•
Horn in South Alrica. \ourgrau speaks
with an Knglish accent and uses c lassic
Fnglish phrases like its a gas. Much
like Hugh (nant. Yourgrau's speech is
halting and awkward, .is il he is unahle
to articulate his thoughts a v lluidly in
person as on pa pel. Net. in the guise of
liis accent, he comes across sounding
classy, charismaiic and well-spoken.
Yourgrau spent most of his life wan
dering, subletting anci house-sitting on
both coasts. I liese real life experiences
proved to be his greatest inspiration. ()f
course, at first it can be hard to sec- how
one could possibly claim that Nourgrau
w rites about i calit\.
Fac h ol Yourgrau's stories is a surreal
glimpse into the fantastical world ol the
author's imagination. Written like
dream journals. Yourgrau s tales some
times capture the tiniclessness and puri
ty of a real-world moment, hut more
often the\ take the readci deep into the
realm of the absurd. Yourgrau's mind
seemingl) knows no boundaries, as,
without ever growing repetitive, he ver
bally explores his subconscious. It seems
as if no situation is too nonsensical for
Yourgrau lo develop. et he spins his
tales with such charisma and believabili
ty that a reaclei is simultaneously con

fronted with the hilarity and the real it)
of the fictional situations.
Yourgrau's distinct style, which he
refers to as "wacky magical realism." is a
blend of man) different elements. llc
savs that he found his literary voice
while making efficient use of a stint .is a
guard loi the Harvard rare book collec
tion. Some of the ingredients subcon
sciously stirred in were magical Russian
writers, American thriller writers,

Japanese poetry, detec
tive writing, and chil
dren's books.
"M\ work is a lot about
dressing up in other peo
ple's costumes, Your
grau explains. "So, I bor
i i)w the cost nines of, say,
a crime writer to write
about love.
As one progresses
through a Yourgrau
book, the thread which
lies the stories together
slowl\ becomes clear.
While each story is
humorous in the telling,

the overall subtext is incredibly sad.
"There's a lot buried," says Yourgrau.
"It's like a confession psychologically . . .
[and the] emotional anchor is complete
ly autobiographical. Hut, its expression
is fantastical.
In his second book, "Wearing Dad's
1 lead," Yourgrau w i ites about the death
of his parents; in his third book, " I he
Sadness of Sex." he laments his failures
in love; and in his most recent book,
"Haunted I raveller." he angstfully
describes a life "mostly wasted," express
ing both self-loathing and pity.
"A lot of it for me is just the experience
of being alive and being overwhelmed at
being alive," he says."I want to connect
to people where [they] feel what's at
stake emotionally in the story and can
share with it."
Lately, Yourgrau has been
lonising on expanding his work into
other mediums. He is intrigued by the
multimedia possibilities presented by
the ever-evolving Internet, which can

include text, spoken word, pictures, and
video streaming. Yourgrau just
launched his personal website,
www.yourgrau.com, and is signed on to
write as a columnist lot the new youth
culture webpage thirsty.com. I lis spoken
word can be heard at mp3lii.com, and
his movie can be seen in installments at
ililni.com.
One reason wll \ his work lias
been so well received b\ pop culture

ina\ be the si i net lire ol
it."I his is Ihe litera
ture ol the M l V sensi
bilit\ because it's
short,"' Yourgrau
explains. 11 is books are
composed ol series of
short stories, linked
together b\ a common
theme. I"he short
length allows Your
grau to create an
entire world for his
audience, time and
time again. Kasily
(lownloadable, quick
enough to keep a

channel surfer's attention, it's u<> sur
prise Yourgrau has (omul an audience
witli the \l I Y generation.
And il thai means getting some
well-deserved recognition, Yourgrau
has no problems with that. "A lot of fame
.iihl a lot o! celebritN and a lot <>l money
would suit me just line. And I don't
think it would harm me either. I think
I'd do reallv good with it.he says.
"W here the trouble is |is that | I want to
do it on 11 lv terms. So, it kind of gets a lii
tle hard.'
After a visit to Las Vegas, Your
grau realized another of his goals as a
writer: to help people to realize the
importance of imagination while siiuul
taneously entertaining tliein. "I think of
tnysell as a very small, slightly poetic
Siegfried and Roy," he says with the
assurance of one who knows he has
finalb said something beautiful iu its
({notability. Ovei the phone, I can
almost hear him wink as he adds,
"Siegfried and Ron, and me."
