# Compilation has hits, but no real charisma

### MICHAEL BAER STAFF WRITER 
Suffice it to say that "It's Only Rock &. Roll," the Rhino soundtrack to
the VHI documentary of rock in movies, is a great compilation. How could
it not be? We've got "La Bamba," "Mustang Sally," "Disco Inferno" and
"The Time Warp" here, among other famous movie moments and cult clas
sics.
Artists include such survivors as Little Richard, Tina Turner, Paul Simon,
and the Ramones, and almost every song is a joy.
However, given all this, it is surprisingly disappointing. The liner notes are
pale, especially by Rhino standards, giving only chart positions, artist names
and movie names. The ordering doesn't seem to reflect any order of style,
time, movie type or period.
And the title song, by the Rolling Stones, isn't even on there! (In fact, 1
don't believe "It's Only Rock 'n' Roll (But 1 Like It)" ever made it into a
movie soundtrack, so I'm not sure this was the best choice for a documen
tary or album title.)
Plus, some of the stuff, though arguably necessary, is really second-rate.
For instance, who needs the live version of The Monkees' "Circle Sky?"
And who won't already have "YMCA" on some CD, record, or tape of
theirs? And shouldn't there be something from "Beverly Hills Cop" or
"The Big Chill"?
These minor grievances don't take away from the enjoyment of the
soundtrack, but Rhino really could have done a lot better with this one. As
is, it's mainly for people who've seen the documentary, are movie junkies,
or just happen to want "Oh Boy!"

and "Proud Mary" on the same CD.
Which I suppose there's nothing
wrong with, now that 1 think about
it. Besides, this scattershot compila
tion might made an appropriate
indoctrination into American pop
ular culture — for those who
haven't been paying attention.
