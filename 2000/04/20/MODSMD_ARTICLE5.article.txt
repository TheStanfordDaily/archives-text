l oyon Hall really a beautiful place
to live?
Maybe so. Over the past lew
weeks, l oyon residents have been
working to make their home a little
more livable while the University
begins renovating the dorm as part

of theCapital Improvement Plan. A

A Beautiful Place to Live" sur

side the courtyard, students have
painted murals with an "Under the
Sea" motif.
Scott Mooncy, a junior and resi
dent assistant in l oyon, rallied the
students to take the dorm back for
themselves during the building and
renovating.
"Upon returning from spring

break, our dorm looked like a war
zone," he said. "Ii wasn't much liin
coming home everyday to metal
scaffolding and plywood walls. It
was at this point that wc decided
something needed to lie done to re
claim Toyon as our own. I orga
nized the Toyon Rebeautification
Project as a way for us to make our
dorm feel like home again.'

Toyon recently began undergoing Capital Improvement Plan renovations, which will last through the summer.
die beginning of $13 million worth
of (lIP renovations, which will con
tinue this summer. Because Toyon
is an older building, dating back to
the mid-19205, the renovations will
be intensive, according to Rodger
Whitney, director of Student I lous
ing Services.
"It's getting there in age and this
is its first substantial overhaul,"
Whitney said. "It's an extremely
well-built concrete building, [and
because it is so stable and difficult to
take apait] it becomes a more ex
tensive project."
Whitney said most of the (IP
renovations, such as those that have
taken place for Wilbur, Florence
Moore and Ixigunita, involve some
overlap between construction and
student occupation.
"All the [CIV programs] happen
over the summer," he saicl. "When
we did all of our studies on 'lbyon,
some of the work we wanted to gel
done is extensive ... so we had to
get some of [it] out of the way."
The work has been localized so
that it oc curs mainly in and around
the common areas of the dorm, not
affecting too many students ad
versely. There are, however, some
students who are becoming more
and more acquainted with the
sounds of drills and hammers on
their rooftops.
Junior Andrew I lindcraker's
room, located in one of the dorm's
two "towers," is virtually encom
passed by the const ruction. Kven so,
lie saicl, he lias few complaints.
"Ultimately, it's always an incon
venience to live in a currently reno
vated dorm," he saicl. "My room is
completely encompassed in scaf
folding, and that does nothing for
our otherwise fabulous view. I here
is defiiiitel\ some noiseâ€” hammer
ing, jackhamniering, shouting and
so forth."
I lie noise, though, never begins
before 10 a.m., allowing students
such as Ilinderaker to maintain
their normal sleep patterns as c lose
ly as pc issible, according to Whittle).

"I must admit, the workers and
CIP have been quite cooperative as
of late," I iinderaker added.
I lie dorm as a whole also suffers
daily inconveniences, including the
loss of the back pat king lot and the
basketball court, lo compensate,
the C IP budget has allocated funds,
estimated to be near SIO,OOO, for
the students to use to "get away
from it all," saicl Whitney.
"We worked that out with the
resident assistants and the resident
fellows [to find a way to compensate
students] and that was viewed by
everyone positively," lie saicl. "It
was just something that came up as
part of our discussion."
Some Toyon residents have al
ready taken a trip to Los Angeles,
partially subsidized with CIP
money, to escape the havoc.
Chough the money hasn't actually
been transferred to the dorm yet,
that is expected to happen soon.
"It's an accounting issue," Whit
ney said, "but we've about got that
figured out. They'll be reimbursed
for the money they've already spent
and then they'll have the rest to
have fun with."
Whittle) saicl the project is mov
ing along just about on track, so far
losing only a clay's work to rain.
When completed, the dorm will
boast seismic upgrades, a new
sprinkler system, computer wiring,
architectural improvements, new
paint, c arpeting, lighting and land
scaping - including a fountain in
the courtyard.
"I think the project's going well,"
Whitnev saicl. "The students have
been working very nicely to keep
the dorm looking nice. It's a very
fast-track project. To irv to get this
clone is extremely'ambitious, but we
have to be able to get this done bv
fall."
Next fall, incoming Toyonites
will get to experience the fruits of
the current residents'sacrific es. But
Moonev maintains a slightlv differ
ent perspective.
"Some people talk about how
beautiful Tovon will be next year,"
lie said, "but, I can't imagine it look
ing much cooler, or feeling more
welcome, than it does right now."
