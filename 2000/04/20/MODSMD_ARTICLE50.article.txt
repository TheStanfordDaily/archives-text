# Thugs getting weak
## 
### ENO SARRIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There are some things about Bone
Thugs-n-Harmony that won't ever
change.
They will always be about smoking
pot and banging women. Musically, the
beats will always be secondary to their
speedy mouths.
So their newest, "B I NHResurrec
tion," isn't a departure from anything
that has come before. They didn't sell
out, they didn't gel old, they didn't
slow down. It's still good old Bone
Thugs.
But that doesn't mean the album is
good or anything. Maybe because their
musical repertoire is so limited — it
just feels like it's been done by them
before. Or maybe because they were a
novelty that stuck around too long. In
any case, hopefully this will be their
last.
From the beginning, this is a purely
hip-hop CD in the bad sense of the
word. The second track comes com
plete with a cheesy R&B lick done by
David's Daughters, a slow and pre
dictable beat, and unoriginal lyrics
laced over Ihe whole thing.
Their drug-inspired songs are still

around.From "Budsmok
ers Only" (a Bone clas
sic) to "Weed Song," a
so-slow-it's-boring song
on the new album. The
worst song on the album
is "Ecstasy" — a song
that affirms that the drug

will "get you on the level with your
girl." Why, oh why, couldn't Bone
leave good enough alone?
Chris Rock once accused the group
of singing "Welfare Carols" after "Ist
of Tha Month" came out. They even
continue this tradition on "Resurrec
tion." "Souljahs Marching." the sev
enth track, is sung to the tune of "The
Saints Come Marching In." Please.
You're that desperate for beats?
The beat on "Can't Give It Up" is
the only interesting one. and its elec
tronica-like sound effects don't really
seem to fit into Bone's style. The rest
of the songs have ho-hum bass lines
without any innovation on the group's
part.
"Resurrection," a song subtitled
"Paper, Paper," is the closest to the old
Bone in a good way. Their speed is
right, their lyrics are a little funny, and
the beat is easy. The chorus is just not
as catchy as those they have come up
with in the past have been.
I've been a fan of Bone for a couple
of years now, but "BTNH Resurrec
tion" has made me rethink my stance
on the group in general. It was such a
bad album that I now doubt that any of
their music has ever been good, and
that somehow I fell into a little popcul-

ture trap and
liked crappy
music. I think I
need to go put
"E. 1999 Eter
nal" on again and
remember the
good old days.
