# Finding humor online, from Jesus to doodie
## 
### 
Not to play second fiddle to a lull-color Chap
pie or anything, hut Nothing but 'Net is ready
for a lora\ into comedy sites now that spring is
in full swing and the drugs are plentiful.

The first rule, when trying to laugh at
something online, is not to use your search
engine in the process. Use Yahoo, and you
will get .ill the humor sites dedicated to spe
cific genres. These are the least funny sites

on the Internet, ranging from nurse liuinoi
(www. nurse friend ly.com/nursing/humor)
to farm jokes
(www.prairielinks.coin/larnier).

Ihe worst site I got from a search
engine was easily
christian humor.about.com/culture/cliris
tianhumor. It wasn't even unintentional
ly funny. I he best, coming from (ioogle,
was ineinbers.aol.eom/gsp// policehu
mor.com. I hen again, I've always found
Police Blotters to be hilarious, and you
may not.

I hi* king of online humor is easily
www.lheonion.com. Nobody heals Ihe
Onion when il comes to professional lay-

out, variety and timeliness. I found most of
the articles to be at least grin-inducing
funny, and many were jusi downright hilar
ious. Another nice thing about I he Onion is

its slightly college-oriented content. Head
lines this week include "Freshman Psych
Student Diagnoses Roommate with Bipolar Dis
order."

Ihe ()nion is serious about it sell, though — and you can
nil when you visit the movie reviews, which attempt to be
professional. I had more fun with the movie reviews at
www.brunching.com, a site run by "The Crunching Slnit
tlecoc ks I lie site was less than compelling in its interface,
but the content makes up lor the clinical appearance. Just
try the Alanis Lyrics Generator — I think you'll chuckle.

www.tliespark.com lias some interesting, but not neces
sarily novel, ideas. There are deadpan poems inspired bv
heavy metal music and all sorts of "tests" based on die
much-forwarded purity test. Really the best tiling on the
site isn't on the site — one of their projects, www.ask.je
sus.org, is really funny. You can jesus-ify any site on the
Internet, and if that sounds funny, I suggest you try Stan-

ford's site and read about pro-fro week
end.
The biggest challenge to The
Onion's supremacy came from
www.fadetoblack. com. Fade to Black
specializes in finding the unintentionally
funny. The Christian fundamentalist
review of "Mission to Mars" is hilarious
— if you are Christian fundamentalist,
you might not agree, of course. The
comic of the day is usually good for a
laugh, and you may want a free email at
godisdead.com if that floats your boat.
A simple site that deserves men
tion in my mind is www.doodie.com.
Now, to warn those not into base humor,
this site is about fecal matter. 1 really
didn't think 1 would find the site funny,
but its simplicity is endearing.
A similar site, dealing in video
humor, is www.dfilm.com. This site is
not funny itself, and requires that you
bring a little to the table yourself by
going to the "make your own dfilm" sec-

lion. Combine that digital film with a lit
tle trashtalking and send it to some
friends, and 1 guarantee you will have
some fun.
There are also potholes on the

road to laughs. I would suggest avoiding
humor portals, sites that claim to be your
window to the world of comedy.
www.humorsearcli.com is exactly what you

should stay away from. Even www.humor, com, a more
professionally done portal, is less than intriguing. But at
least ;ii humor.com you can find links to comic strips and
comedians.
So, get out there, take advantage of that slightly loony
state that spring puts us in, and laugh your little butt oft.
