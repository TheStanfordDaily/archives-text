Battering Rams
Some men seem to think that sex is an
occasion to slam then penises as far into
ilie woman .is possible. Really, the fact
that vou'ie in bed with her is a piettv
good indication that the castle gates are
already open to von, so throw youi bat
tering ram away.
Not that there's no time and place for
deep tlu lists. When vou're iu the throes of
passion, a powerful thrust is certainly
appropriate. When she's screaming
"harder! deeper!'" then it might be dan
gerous for you to do otherwise, But
there's a difference between potent
thrusting and painful busting. Ask her il
you're unsure.
Deep thrusting obviously offers the
advantage of more stimulated surface
area for each partner. You're more likely
to hit hei (i-spot il you're in a little ways.
Also, unless the penis is especially long or
the vagina is shallow, deep thrusting helps
to align his pubic bone against her chloral
area, making an orgasm during inter
course more likely.
Deeper thrusting may also allow the
penis to pull on the labia minora (inner
lips) for ;i longer period of time, also stim
ulating the clitoris, 112 inally, the inner vagi
na (beyond the first inch 01 so) usually
responds better to stretching and pres
sure than to light tout lies, especially as a
woman approaches orgasm. If a woman
orgasms while a man is inside her, he will
likelv feel the back of her vagina pulsing

and contracting around him, a pleasur
able sensation for both partners.
You can learn which parts of hei vagina
respond besi to the head of your penis by
paying attention to her during sex. Once
\ou understand her body, you'll find that
you're able to combine certain angles and
certain positions to pressure any part of
her vagina. You c an also experiment with
your hands to figure out what you need to
do with your penis.
Foils
If you're interested in trying a shallow
er, gentler style of thrusting, imagine that
you're a fencer and your penis is your foil,
fhis technique makes sex more ol a
rhythmic dance, which is particularly nice
at the beginning of intercourse.
The walls of a woman's vagina c hange
shape with each thrust of intercourse.
With each stroke, thousands of nerve end
ings are being very pleasurably tugged,
flic most sensitive part of the vagina is
the opening, up to an inch 01 two deep.
I "his area also becomes the snuggest part
when the vagina is aroused. Shallow
thrusting and gentle motion around the
lim of the vagina allow the head of the
penis to stimulate this area. Shallow
thrusting also encourages the snuggest
part of the vagina to wrap around the
most sensitive part of the penis, just below
the head.
The hard part, of course, is in making
shallow thrusts without pulling out to far
and having to start over again (of course,
this can happen during deep thrusts as
well.) Miss Sass suggests you insert your
penis just enough that it's not falling out,
then position your body comfortably so

the only thing you will have
to move is your hips. I lien
try nudging your penis in
slightly, then letting it slide
hack out. I hink of it as teas
ing your partner — you're
offering her a taste, hut
you're taking it away before
she gets too much.
I lie l antric sex masters
usually caution ahout deep
thrusting during inter
course. Instead, the} rec
ommend a ration ol five-to
one or nine-to-one shallow
to-deep thrusts. As your
partner becomes more
aroused, increase the ration
to two deep for even lour
shallow, and eventuallv one
shallow to one deep.
Thrust's Not a Must

You can also experiment with non
thrusting sex. Ladies, try lying on top of
him with his penis inside your hody. Cluys,
ignore the impulse to start thrusting;
instead, move your pelvis in a circular
motion, and try to press your pelvic hone
against her clitoris.
Next, imagine that your bodies are ton
net ted. ( l hey already are, sort of.) Imag
ine that your skin is melting together.
Relax into each other. Now imagine that
your one body is actually an audience
watching a Stanford football game. Some
one runs in front of the audience and
yells, "Let's all do the wave!"
As this miniature yell leader runs past,
let each segment of your united hody rise
and fall, still trying to stay completely con
nected to your lover. It's tough, but with
practice you may find that this exercise
helps to get your more in sync with your
lover's body.
You < an also try remaining perfectly still
and coordinating your breathing. One
partner breathes in, the other breathes
out, and so on. Once you get the hang of
it, you may achieve wonderful experiences
and increased intimacy during sex. Also,
some couples find rocking back and forth
with the penis inside to be pleasurable.
Finally, you can squeeze your genitals
for a while rather than thrusting. He
squeezes (thus expanding and contracting
the penis), then she squeezes (thus con
tracting the walls of the vagina.) lie
warned. This technique may end in a bout
of the giggles.

You can also experiment with non
thrusting sex. Ladies, try lying on top of
him with his penis inside your hody. Cluys,
ignore the impulse to start thrusting;
instead, move your pelvis in a circular
motion, and try to press your pelvic hone
against her clitoris.
Next, imagine that your bodies are ton
net ted. ( l hey already are, sort of.) Imag
ine that your skin is melting together.
Relax into each other. Now imagine that
your one body is actually an audience
watching a Stanford football game. Some
one runs in front of the audience and
yells, "Let's all do the wave!"
As this miniature yell leader runs past,
let each segment of your united hody rise
and fall, still trying to stay completely con
nected to your lover. It's tough, but with
practice you may find that this exercise
helps to get your more in sync with your
lover's body.
You < an also try remaining perfectly still
and coordinating your breathing. One
partner breathes in, the other breathes
out, and so on. Once you get the hang of
it, you may achieve wonderful experiences
and increased intimacy during sex. Also,
some couples find rocking back and forth
with the penis inside to be pleasurable.
Finally, you can squeeze your genitals
for a while rather than thrusting. He
squeezes (thus expanding and contracting
the penis), then she squeezes (thus con
tracting the walls of the vagina.) lie
warned. This technique may end in a bout
of the giggles.

Battering Rams
Some men seem to think that sex is an
occasion to slam then penises as far into
ilie woman .is possible. Really, the fact
that vou'ie in bed with her is a piettv
good indication that the castle gates are
already open to von, so throw youi bat
tering ram away.
Not that there's no time and place for
deep tlu lists. When vou're iu the throes of
passion, a powerful thrust is certainly
appropriate. When she's screaming
"harder! deeper!'" then it might be dan
gerous for you to do otherwise, But
there's a difference between potent
thrusting and painful busting. Ask her il
you're unsure.
Deep thrusting obviously offers the
advantage of more stimulated surface
area for each partner. You're more likely
to hit hei (i-spot il you're in a little ways.
Also, unless the penis is especially long or
the vagina is shallow, deep thrusting helps
to align his pubic bone against her chloral
area, making an orgasm during inter
course more likely.
Deeper thrusting may also allow the
penis to pull on the labia minora (inner
lips) for ;i longer period of time, also stim
ulating the clitoris, 112 inally, the inner vagi
na (beyond the first inch 01 so) usually
responds better to stretching and pres
sure than to light tout lies, especially as a
woman approaches orgasm. If a woman
orgasms while a man is inside her, he will
likelv feel the back of her vagina pulsing

and contracting around him, a pleasur
able sensation for both partners.
You can learn which parts of hei vagina
respond besi to the head of your penis by
paying attention to her during sex. Once
\ou understand her body, you'll find that
you're able to combine certain angles and
certain positions to pressure any part of
her vagina. You c an also experiment with
your hands to figure out what you need to
do with your penis.
Foils
If you're interested in trying a shallow
er, gentler style of thrusting, imagine that
you're a fencer and your penis is your foil,
fhis technique makes sex more ol a
rhythmic dance, which is particularly nice
at the beginning of intercourse.
The walls of a woman's vagina c hange
shape with each thrust of intercourse.
With each stroke, thousands of nerve end
ings are being very pleasurably tugged,
flic most sensitive part of the vagina is
the opening, up to an inch 01 two deep.
I "his area also becomes the snuggest part
when the vagina is aroused. Shallow
thrusting and gentle motion around the
lim of the vagina allow the head of the
penis to stimulate this area. Shallow
thrusting also encourages the snuggest
part of the vagina to wrap around the
most sensitive part of the penis, just below
the head.
The hard part, of course, is in making
shallow thrusts without pulling out to far
and having to start over again (of course,
this can happen during deep thrusts as
well.) Miss Sass suggests you insert your
penis just enough that it's not falling out,
then position your body comfortably so

the only thing you will have
to move is your hips. I lien
try nudging your penis in
slightly, then letting it slide
hack out. I hink of it as teas
ing your partner — you're
offering her a taste, hut
you're taking it away before
she gets too much.
I lie l antric sex masters
usually caution ahout deep
thrusting during inter
course. Instead, the} rec
ommend a ration ol five-to
one or nine-to-one shallow
to-deep thrusts. As your
partner becomes more
aroused, increase the ration
to two deep for even lour
shallow, and eventuallv one
shallow to one deep.
