# Almodovar film falls into sex and coke-fueled frenzy
## 
### JESSICA POWELL 
First shot: Yeye, the demure
artsy girl and her best friend
Alberto. Alberto's having an
affair with a secretive man
who bares all in the bedroom
(flash to explicit shower sex
scene) but who will reveal
nothing about his personal
life.
Quick, blood red-filtered
shot of Max, the gigolo who
disappeared mysteriously two
years ago, leaving Yeye bro
ken-hearted. Max has
returned to Madrid to recon
quer her, as well as to escape a
nasty incident that occurred in
Barcelona.
But before finding Yeye,
Max is seduced by her room
mate, Monica (cut to a blonde
coke-head nihilist in a
sequined top).
Flash to Maria, Yeye's room
mate who's trying to find love
in the classifieds, and then cut
to Luis, a cop bent on catching
Max.
Montage scenes will follow:
drag queens, graphic sex,
5,000 grams of coke . . . It's
frenesi! frenesi!
Set to the pulsing dance
music and flashing lights of
Madrid's fashionable club
scene, "Not Love Just Frenzy"
("Mas que amor, frenesi")
aims to emulate the speed of
the nightlife it uses as its back
chop.
The film was released to
great success in Spain in 1996,
and has no doubt suddenly
been released here — four
years later — with the hopes of
cashing in on the success of
Pedro "Everything About My
Mother" Almodovar. In fact,
its outrageousness may even
rer; ill Almod-

retail /\iinoci
ovar's "Pepi,
Luci, Bom y
otras i hie as
del montan."
However, it's
slicker than
that 1980

film, and thus its sloppy plot
lines are fin less forgiveable.
Fhe main problem is that in
trying to recreate the frenetic
atmosphere of the Madrid
club scene, the- producers have
erred on the side of overkill.
In "Not Love Just Frenzy," the
abundance of side stories is as
problematic as the drug habits
of the characters themselves,
and although the multiple
plotlines make for occasionally
interesting distractions, they
are often left hastily and poor
ly resolved (i.e., the affair
between Alberto and his
lover).
At the same time, some of
the little flourishes and exag
gerations added by the direc
tors do pay off. In true Almod
ovar style, many of the charac
ters prove to be hilarious cari
catures, with the drag queens
Jane Fonda, Dolly Parton, and
Jackie (). standing alongside
such standard fare as the for
lorn art student (Yeye) and
the awkward but endearing
freak (Maria).
In fact, the hyperbolic nature
of this film is both its strength
and greatest weakness, as so
much of this movie is both
wonderfully overdone and
annoyingly superfluous: the
name of the club where the
characters hang out is "Frene
si,"' the song that plays in the
background is "Frenesi," and
in the final moments of the film
Monica tells Yeye that love is
no more than . . . guess what?
"Not Love Just Frenzy" is a
slick but slightly sloppy piecing
together of many intertwined
stories. With a glamorous look
at drugs, drag queens, and dat
ing, it's an enjoyable romp
through Madrid nightlife. Ciet
tintr to see

Wf
the paella
purse that
Jackie ().
carries is in
itself worth
the price of
admission.
