Your college years made for some
interesting ways of expressing
yourself. And just because you
stand at the threshold of
adulthood doesn't mean you
have to check your individuality
at the door. So, express
yourself with a new
Ford or Mercury
vehicle and get $400*
models from the
Ford College Graduate Program.
No pain. All gain.
