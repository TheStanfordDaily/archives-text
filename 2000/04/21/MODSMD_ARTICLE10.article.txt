Six years ago, the United Electrical, Radio and Machine
Workers of America (UK) and Mexico's Authentic Labor
Front (FAT) began supporting each other to improve labor
conditions for workers in both countries. According a flier
for the group, the alliance " is an effort to build a new kind
of international relationship focused on organizing and
based on rank and file solidarity."
According to Robin Alexander, director of UK Interna
tional Labor Affairs, the alliance was formed when members
of the union realized they were losing jobs — nearly 10,000
— to workers in other countries. She said they "felt an oblig
ation to come up with a new type of international affairs, fo
cusing lt-ss on management and resolutions and more on or
ganizing — more a rank and file perspective."
Representatives of the American union traveled to Mexi
co to participate in a conference with labor unions from the
United States, Mexico and Canada. Union officials hoped to
develop a strategy to prevent job loss due to the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
