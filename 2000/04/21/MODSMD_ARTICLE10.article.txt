"Wanted: Strike Breakers. Women ages 11 + for factory
work: Mexico 10-14 hours, $6/day" read a poster hung by
the Student Labor Action Coalition in White Plaza earlier
this week.
The group sponsored "Crossing the Border for Jusice:
International Solidarity for Workers Rights," a program fea
turing; labor union representatives fiwni the U.S. and Mexi
co, on Thursday, evening.. !( it. )
Six years ago, the United Electrical, Radio and Machine
Workers of America (UK) and Mexico's Authentic Labor
Front (FAT) began supporting each other to improve labor
conditions for workers in both countries. According a flier
for the group, the alliance " is an effort to build a new kind
of international relationship focused on organizing and
based on rank and file solidarity."
According to Robin Alexander, director of UK Interna
tional Labor Affairs, the alliance was formed when members
of the union realized they were losing jobs — nearly 10,000
— to workers in other countries. She said they "felt an oblig
ation to come up with a new type of international affairs, fo
cusing lt-ss on management and resolutions and more on or
ganizing — more a rank and file perspective."
Representatives of the American union traveled to Mexi
co to participate in a conference with labor unions from the
United States, Mexico and Canada. Union officials hoped to
develop a strategy to prevent job loss due to the North
American Free Trade Agreement.


The Stanford Daily
Benedict© Martinez, of Mexico's Authentic Labor Front, and Robin Alexander, of the Unit
ed Electrical Workers, spoke about the battle for decent working conditions last night.
"Workers in Mexico and the
U.S. have the same enemies — the
t ran sua t ion al corporal ions,"
Alexander said.
International solidarity was <1
common theme throughout the
program, particularly in light of
the recent protests against the
World Bank and International
Monetary Fund in Seattle and
Washington, 1).( 1.
" The broader struggle for jus
tire [in the United States] is inti
mately tied to that struggle in oilier
parts of the world," junior Shaw
San I.in said. I iu, aSI A(. member,
helped organize the program.
111 fact, the labor alliance's ton
terns reach beyond the effects of
NAFTA. Benedicto Mertinez, a
top elected official in the Mexican
union, said he is "concerned we
won't have enough strenth to turn
back the policies of organizations
like the IMF and World Hank."

Mertinez continued, "1 believe
little bv little* we are having success
in turning back these economic
policies. The leaders of the IMF
and World Bank are beginning to
acknowledge the impact these
policies have had on people
around the world.
"The bottom line," concluded
Mertinez, "is we need to globalize
our struggle."
Students also heard from
Medeta Vasquez, a leader in or
ganizing women factory workers
in Irapuato, (Guanajuato. She dis
cussed working conditions in a
strawberry processing plant
where women worked 14- to la
bour days for little pay. Vasquez
said workers are not provided
with the proper equipment, such
as aprons, gloves and shoes, that
would prevent accidents and in
juries in the plant.
Rebeca Range), a junior, came
to the event "out of personal inter
est. My pat ents are from Guanaju
ato (the state in which the factory
being discussed is located], and
I'm very much concerned with

their situation and the situation of
people like them across the
world."
The final straw, according to
Vasquez, came last May when the
plant managers refused to share
profits with workers. Mexican law
guarantees workers a cut of corpo
rate profits. Workers "decided it
was no longer possible to take this
kind of treatment," said Vasquez.
It was at this time that workers ap
proached Mexico's Authentic
Labor Front about forming a
union to protect their rights.
SIAC, a student group found
ed last year, is dedicated to educa
tion and action in support of work
ers' rights . "Before we can act, we
need to know what is going on,"
Liu said.
Junior katherine Lemons, a
member of SIAC, said the group
represents "an important growing
movement. Especially now —
there's a lot of momentum."
"Some people are thrown off by
the term labor' — all it means is to
support the rights of anyone who
works for a living," Liu said.
