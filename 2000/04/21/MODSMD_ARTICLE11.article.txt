# Stanford e-mail kept private
## Only in rare cases is e-mail privacy compromised, computer officials say

People who send e-mail from their school or work
place often receive no guarantees that what they write
will remain private. But even though it saves each
piece of e-mail sent on its systems, Stanford says it will
only read e-mail under limited circumstances.
Data on the Leland computer systems is backed up
and kept for one year, but unless a user wants to look
at his or her own files, the data is only looked at in
cases of court orders and suspicion of violation of the
Leland Systems Usage Policy, which prohibits abus
ing University computer network resources.
A "snapshot" of each Leland account is taken every
24 hours, so only e-mail left on the system for at least
a day is saved by the University.
The Computer and Network Usage Policy states,
"Only the University's Computer Security Officer or
designate can authorize the inspection of private data
or monitoring of messages (including electronic mail)
when there is reasonable cause to suspect improper
use of computer or network resources."
According to the University's Computer Security
Officer Stephen Hansen, e-mail is examined only in
extreme circumstances when there is suspicion of net
work abuse.
He added that the University must also produce
available information when ordered by a court.
"Individuals must obey court orders, and the Uni
versity is not immune from that," Hansen said.

According to Debra Zumwalt, the University's act
ing general counsel, "E-mail is considered to be docu
ments just like any other document" that can be re
quested by a court order.
The backed-up data on the Leland systems is used
in case something is accidentally deleted, but the main
reason is in case of disk failure.
"Any good system administrator backs up data in
case a disk drive goes south," Hansen said. 1 his also
makes the data available when, in rare cases, it is need
ed for investigations.
"The University doesn't go trolling for e-mail,"
Zumwalt said. She advised people read the detailed
University policy and added that looking at e-mail
"doesn't happen very often, and hopefully, people
won't abuse the system often."
Dean of Students Marc Wais emphasized the Uni
versity's commitment to maintain student privacy in
"everything from judicial affairs to academic perfor
mance," but he realizes that it's almost impossible to
completely ensure that, especially when it comes to
the Internet.
Both officials mentioned the difficulty of maintain
ing e-mail privacy.
"Issues of usage and privacy is a rapidly changing
field," Hansen said.
As an individual who uses e-mail, "I'm very
thoughtful about where an e-mail can potentially end
up," Wais said.
Students seemed rather comfortable with the Uni
versity policy. "I am not concerned with the Universi
ty's actions toward electronic mail policy," freshman
Christian Pecaut said.
Freshman Casey Brazeal said, "I'm glad there's a
safety net. I'm not doing anything wrong, so I have
nothing to worry about."
