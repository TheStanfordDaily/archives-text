# Right-to-life groups speak to Herstory
## Anti-abortion leaders stress alternatives to women's program 
### MARY CRISHAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Wednesday evening,
Toyon Lounge housed the latest
feature in the Herstory program,
when speakers from the Pregnan
cy Care Centers of San Carlos and
Menlo Park presented the panel:
"Women's Voices on Sexuality,
Pregnancy, Abortion and Post-
Abortion."
Stanford Students For Life, in
an unprecedented appearance on
the Herstory agenda, co-spon
sored the event.
To a mixed right-to-life and
pro-choice audience of approxi
mately 30 undergraduate and
graduate students and community
members, the panel discussed the
work of the Pregnancy Care Cen
ter in their abstinence program,
intervention services, crisis preg
nancy services and post-abortion
counseling.
Annabel Paris, the executive di

rector of the San Carlos center,
presented the portion of the pro
gram discussing sexual decision
making. The center offers an absti
nence program for teenagers and
junior high students, in which
Paris said the counselors "empha
size the life-long consequences of
our decisions," such as unintend
ed pregnancy and sexually trans
mitted diseases.
Paris said safe sex programs
were a failure and pointed out that
condoms are not totally successful
in preventing STDs and pregnan
cy.
The programs at the Pregnancy
Clare Centers advocate abstinence
instead of condom use as a means
of protection against STDs.
Susan Robertson, the associate
director of the Pregnancy Centers,
discussed the crisis pregnancy ser
vices of the center. She said the
centers present pregnant women
with four different alternatives:
two-parent rearing, single-parent
rearing, adoption and abortion.
Robertson said that the center is
primarily concerned with making
sure that women know and under
stand their options, and provides
counselingandsupport regardless
of I lie decision each woman
makes.
The third speaker, Laura
Heller, the director of the Menlo
I'ark center, discussed post-abor
tion stress and counseling. She
said that although the most com
mon argument of right to life ad
vocates centers on the life of the
fetus, an equally important argu
ment centers on the woman and
the physical, emotional and spiri
tual effects from which some
women suffer.
"So often with abortions,"
Heller said, "women are misin
formed, experience conflict and

lack o! support from family and
friends, feel rushed and without
adequate time to process what is
happening, and have a lack of
good information on the risks in
volved. I liese are the main factors
c ausing post-abortion trauma and
stress."
Post-abortion stress entails hav
ing difficulty processing the fear,
anger, sadness or guilt surround
ing an abortion; having difficulty
grieving the loss of the fetus and
having difficulty finding peace
with oneself and others who were
involved with the abortion, such as
the father, the doctor or other
family members, 1 feller said.
Brendan Stuhan, senior and
president of Stanford Students
For Life, praised the center's pre
sentation and efforts. "Women
should definitely be informed that

abortion is not a simple, salt.', sur
gical procedure, but rather a cost
ly decision which poses health and
spiritual risks to them and results
in llie destruction of human life."
Junior Anne Berry praised
SSFL's involvement in this year's
Herstory. She said, "The issue of
abortion is obviously one that
greatly affects women, and 1 think
that too often being pro-woman is
associated exclusively with being
pro-choice, when (his is clearly not
the case. I hope these speakers
tonight helped to dispel the myth
that 'pro-life' and 'pro-woman' are
mutually exclusive."
