# U.S. military says prisoners shot during Korean War

### 
SOL) 1H KOREA (AP) — South Korean sol
dins and police, observed at times bv U.S. Army
officers, executed more than 2,000 political pris
oners without trial in the early weeks of the Kore
an War, according to declassified U.S. military
documents and witnesses.
Supreme commander Gen. Douglas
M acArthur became aware of at least one of the
mass shootings, according to documents originally
classified "top secret."
l he new information, detailed in reporting by
I he Associated Press and a Korean researcher,
substantiates what some historians have long
believed: Large numbers of South Korean leftists
arrestee! by the right-wing regime were secretly
killed as its forces retreated before the North
Korean army in mid-1950, apparently to keep
them from collaborating with the communist
invaders.
Subsequently, during their brief occupation of
the south, the North Koreans executed many sus
pected rightists. I hose killings, once discovered,
were widely publicized in the Western press.
Information about the South Korean govern
ment's mass executions was suppressed for
decades under this country's former military
rulers. Relevant South Korean records were
destroyed, researchers believe. But victims' fami
lies recently began speaking out, and human
bones have been unearthed at mass burial sites.
Witnesses describe brutal mass shootings. A
retired South Korean admiral told the AP that 200
people, never put on trial, were taken offshore to
be shot and dumped into the sea. Villagers in the
Dokchon area remembered truckloads of civilians,
trussed together, brought to the hills here and

executed by South Korean military polite.
I'he AP learned it was a U.S. Army account of
those Dokchon killings that reached Mac Arthur.
Although the legendary U.S. general also com
manded the South Korean military at the time, he
referred this report on its actions to American
diplomats "for consideration" and "such action as
you deem appropriate."
The U.S. ambassador, John Muccio, later
reported back that he urged President Syngman
Rhee and Defense Minister Shin Sung-mo to end
summary executions deemed illegal and inhu
mane.
"I urged Captain Shin to see that the Korean
Army, Police and Youth Groups carry out execu
tions of captured members of the enemy forces,
including guerrillas, only after due process of law
has been observed and that when carried out they
should be in a humane manner," Muccio wrote in
an Aug. 25, 1950, letter to Mac Arthur's top subor
dinate, the U.S. Bth Army commander Lt. Gen.
Walton L. Walker.
South Korean soldiers had shown "extreme
cruelty" toward the condemned prisoners at Dok
chon, a U.S. military police investigator, Sgt. Ist
Class Frank Pearce, said in a written report to his
company commander on the shootings.
He and other American witnesses reported that
200 to 300 prisoners, including women and a girl
12 or 13 years old, were killed by South Korean
military police on Aug. 10, 1950, on a mountain
near this hamlet 155 miles southeast of Seoul,
South Korea's capital.
A South Korean officer told the Americans the
prisoners were "spies" — not North Korean sol
diers or guerrillas.
