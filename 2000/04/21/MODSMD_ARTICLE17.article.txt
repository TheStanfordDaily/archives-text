together to mark the first anniuT

school slit><)ting.
" l ocla\ is about the angels who

remember, (.t>\. bill Owens told
a crowd at the state Capitol in
Denver.
Owens presided over the
moment ol silence that marked
the instant Dvlan klebold and
Klit Harris began the bloodbath,
killing 12 students and a teacher
and wounding 20 before taking
their own lives.
I here was little mention of the
gunmen Thursday, and the acts of
remembrance — the I*s balloons,
the bell tolling l!i times, 13 doss
es erected — were meant to recall
the victims and not the killers,
rhe victims' families had even

asked tlit* news media to avoid am
references to klebold and Harris.
"Too often over the last year,
the coverage of the tragedy at
Columbine High School has
focused on the two young men
who so vicioush took the lives of
our loved ones and friends. But
not today," the governor said in
opening the ceremony at the
(iapitol.
"Because today is about the vic
tims of Columbine and their fam
ilies."
The killers' parents apologized
again last week for theit sons'

actions. Their whereabouts
Thursday were not clear.
As a lone bagpiper played
"Ama/ing Grace," the governor
and his wife planted columbines,
the state flower that gave the
school its name, beneath a flag
pole.
In Littleton, families and
friends of slain students Rachel
Scott, Gore) Del'ooter and teach
er Dave Sanders embraced and
wept during a memorial at the
cemetery where all three are
buried.
'Today can be a new begin

ning, not just for our community
but for our nation," pastor Billy
Kpperhart said.
A fishing vest and lures
adorned the grave of DePooter,
who loved fly fishing. Behind the
grave markers stood 13 wooden
crosses to honor the victims. An
angel windsock hung from Scott's
cross, blowing gently in the
breeze.
When the service was over, 13
white balloons drifted into the sky
as a symbol of letting go. For sev
eral minutes, DePooter's mother,
Patricia, refused to leave her son's
grave.
"It's hard just remembering it.
the good times, and then remem
bering how it all ended," said
Cherry Creek High student Sam
Mamtherne, 17, who was friends
with Scott.
Columbine senior Richard
Castaldo, left a paraplegic in the
shootings, also struggled to make
sense of the events.
"I've spent the last couple of
days trying to find the right
words. I can't really find them," a
weeping Castaldo told about
1,500 people at a Trinity Christian
Center service.
At Fairmount Cemetery in
Denver, the family of victim Isaiah
Shoels was joined by Martin
Luther King 111 in remembering
the 18-year-old boy who dreamed
of becoming a music executive
and talent scout like his father.
After the service, Michael
Shoels knelt and kissed the grass
over his son's grave.
