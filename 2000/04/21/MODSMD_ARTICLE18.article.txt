### 
Published Since 1891

THAI TIMK OF year is upon us
again. I lie Draw. With the deadline
to lorm and register draw groups
rapidly approaching, that extra
twinge of anxiety is being felt around cam
pus. Yon can see it in (unipero where that
group of ( .) "great friends" is trying to figure
out a way to all live together next year. Or on
the Row where, lor some juniors, the reality
of . . . suspenseful music here . . . an un pre
ferred year is upon them.
So for all the freshman out there who are
about to go through their first year ol the
housing draw and all those uppen lassmen
whose memories need a little refreshing,
here are a lew helpful hints to surviving the
Draw with your friendships and sanity
intact.

Number I — Be honest. Your draw group
can be a vitally important part of the upcom
ing year, and when deciding who to live with,
honesty is, like your mom told you, the best
polity. II you have serious concerns about a
potential drawmate, get 'em out as soon as
possible, both so you can avoid the harangue
of a potentially uncomfortable living situation
the next year and so that person will have
pleny of time to join up with another group.
At the same time, keep in mind, that tolerane
is a big | >11is here too. Just because someone
isn't your best friend, doesn't mean you can't
draw with them, especially il they're not
going to be your roommate. As many familiar
laces as possible make living in a house all the
better.
Number 2 — I he disability draw is a crap

shoot. For all the stories you've heard about
how the kid with some minute ailment ended
up in Lambda Nu with 7 of his friends, there
are draw groups living somewhere they
didn't want to end up, cursing the disability
draw.
Number 3 — There is a chance that there
will be draw group drama. Now, not to scare
you too much, but it's always best to go into
the Draw with a good sense of perspective.
Don't take it for granted that your group will
stay together perfectly — for some there are
always changes — and it is not the end of the
world il things don't work out. It's those
groups that think they have the perfect solu
tion figured out in February that often end
up having difficulty when April 30 rolls
around.

Number 4 — Number 1,984 is not the end
of the world. Alter you've paced and sweated
over your number and you find it to be much
higher than you would have liked, don t head
for the top ol Hoover lower with a hacksaw
to get through the safety bars.
A great draw number is not always the key
to a happy year. There are tons of lblks living
in houses that drew unpreferred loving life
right now and people who drew in the lower
digits lamenting their house. Remember, that
a quad in Roble is an opportunity, not a chal
lenge.
So, there are a few words of advice.
Whether you follow them is up to you. Best of
luck with the Draw.
