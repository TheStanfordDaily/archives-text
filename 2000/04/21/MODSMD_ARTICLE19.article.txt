# THE 						FLIP SIDE
## Election fever is on 
### 
Hi. Vlv Maine is Jit Bhattacharya and I
would like lo be youi ANSI senator.
Now, I know what you're thinking,
w lis would I, of all people, want to he
.in ASSI senator, especially since the election is
alreach over? Ill put it to you straight. I want to
work loi you. I want to make Stanford a little
perkier, a little cleaner and a little better plate
for the children ol this great nation.
Hut you're prohahh wondering how I'm
going to at hieve such loli\ goals. It's simple. My
platform is (I.RT.A.L. ("Oct Rid of the F.ntire

ASSU Today!").
I hat's right, it's the pi.it
form that Stanford students
have been waiting for. It's a
platform based on the simple
truth: Nobody cares a smidgen
about the ASSU. If anything,
most people have been
annoyed by the .ASSI at some
point in their Stanford t arecrs.
Well, it's time someone started

listening to flic* hearts and
minds of our students. \on find <i wa\ to put me
on that Senate, I will guarantee sou two things:
I) I Ik- climbing wall will linalh be built and
afterward 2) I he ASS I will be no more.
bin no good politician would jusi spout out
impossible promises .uid ask people to follow. So
let's pause loi ,i minute and lake a look «it some
of the extra-lovable parts of the ASSI that make
it ilie siell.il organization that we adore
l or starlet s, there's ASSI banking, the safest
and most secure plate to store your student
group's funds. Hell, it's so safe and secure that
not even Y( )l are allowed to withdraw money
from your own account. And, if you finally do
gel through the paperwork detailing the event
for which von spent the money and the invest
ment strategy for the expenditure, you will
receive vour reimbursement check iu two to
three weeks il tilings are going well and if the
lack who hates everybody in the ASSI banking
office (let ides she likes you.
And what is up with tb.it lady? I have avoid
ed the ASSI since niv sophomore year simply so
I wouldn't have to cower beneath her unyield
ing gaze. There were days when you went in
asking for .1 deposit slip, and she gave you a look
tli.it made the big, angry gu\ at the post office
seem like a kitten. If the two of them were iu a
room together and forced to rumble, I would
bet on her every time. All in all, losing ASSI
banking along with tlie lady who bates every
body would be no great loss to Stanford.
Secondly, there's elections. ASSI elections
ruin any aesthetic value our campus ever had by
plastering the campus with ugly flourescent fly
ers. I be only campaign flyers that ever caught
anyone's eye were "Moon the ASSI " and"I
Shave Mv Pits — Vote 4 Aronowitz."
(it anted, without an ASSI J, we would lose the
opportunity to have such saucy campaign slo
gans, but it's pretty obvious most of our c andi
dates have lost all sense of originality reverting

hack to "Vote 1 Me in italicized and shadowed
font. In reality, elections at Stanford are a game
of getting as many people as possible to remem
ber your uaine on election day and then actual
ly getting them to vote. Desire, goals and cjuali
fications are overrated anyway.
1 hirtllv. What on earth does the ASSI do? I
am a Stanford student. I have very specific
needs. I need to do lauudrv. I need to wash my
car. I need to find a date to the senior formal.
Kill does the ASSL provide a laundry service or
a car washing service or a dating service? Of
course not! Ihe ASSL' doesn't really provide
anything.
Now maybe that's being a little extreme. I he
new Ruble dorm theater is ;i big success for this
year's ASSI senate given the problems with
performance space on campus. Ihe Stanford
Aftei Midnight program has been taken lor
granted by most Stanford students, but it is
another achievement for which the ASSU
deserves credit. Hut in lout years ol attending
Stanford, these are the only two worthwhile
programs that I have seen the ASSI achieve. I
ask you, mv fellow Stanford students, is this fair
to you, as voters?
With the annoyance of ASSI banking, the
petulance of ASSI elections and the uselessness
of the ASSI as a student voice, it stands to rea
son that we don't really need an ASSU.
C.R.K.A.T. promises not only to get rid ol this
limping student organization and give the
power bat k to the people, but also we promise to
use the leftover money in the- ASSU account to
cut tuition by $4 for every Stanford undergrad
uate next year and to start the Stanford I.auntlry
service. I assure you it will be done.
I he ASSI , to most Stanford students, is a
bunch of poli st i majors who meet once a week
and call themselves the senate, and in the mean
time, debate in elevated style while pretending
to t are about important campus issues such as
the ASSU Course Ouide. It's really reminiscent
ol the pretend (lonvention we all
tlitl in our fifth grade U.S. History class.
Nobody cares about the ASSU. It's plain and
simple. It's because there is no passion left in the
ASSI , no undercurrent fur students to get excit
ed.
Look at the voter turnout. More importantly,
find out how many of those that voted, voted
only lor their group's special fee. And if they
were grad students, they only voted because by
voting they entered a raffle for a free Palm I'ilot.
Most of them voted multiple times so they'd
have a better c hance tif winning.
Nobody, and I mean nobody, cares about the
ASSU. It's the hard and simple truth. But then
again, nobody really tares about anything at
Stanford, so we're back to where we started.

Jit Hhattaclunya is a senior who voted as a grad stu
dent. At least, that's what he told the people at the Tree
House on "(•rod Student Night " so he could get a free
pitcher. E-mail jiK" lelond with questions about the
"A ronowitz.2ooo" campaign for state representative.
