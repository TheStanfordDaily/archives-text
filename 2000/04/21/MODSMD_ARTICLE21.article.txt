False advertising in the census
Last week, each student received a Census Report,
and one in six received the long form (myself among
them). I consider filling out the census to be an impor
tant civic duty, so when I read the cover letter explaining
that the longer form "is estimated to take nine minutes
to complete," 1 didn't hesitate to start answering the sur
vey questions. Twenty minutes later, 1 came to the last
page and noticed the following statement in the lower
right corner: "The Census Bureau estimates that, on
average, each respondent will take 24 minutes to com
plete this form."
It the unidentified organization which "helped" the
(lensus Bureau by providing the cover letter had stated at
the beginning that the long form takes 24 minutes to
complete, I would have filled out the form and submitted
it. Had there been no official estimate by the Census
Bureau, 1 would have assumed gross incompetence, for
given the unidentified organization and submitted the
form. However, by subtracting 15 minutes from the olli
cial time estimate, the organization which provided this
cover letter did a great disservice to the Stanford student
body and the Census Bureau: they knowingly provided
false information to students.
We need to teach people that they do not have to lie
to convince Stanford students to perforin civic duties; in

fact, lying only serves to promote further alienation. I
refuse to support dishonesty ... 1 ripped up my com
pleted census form and recycled it.
