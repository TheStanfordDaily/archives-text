# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Stanford responds to recent acts of intolerance 
### MARK WAIS DEAN OF STUDENTS 
l.asi year in a (lampus Viewpoint, I
wrote about the numerous ways in which I
rave endlessh about the spec ial <|ualities ol
academic and student Itle here on the
l artn. I described what are "uniqueK Stan
ford" traditions and values (i.e., 112 unda
mental Standard. Ilonoi Code. Big(iaine,
(iaieties, etc.), whit h. in m\ view, are Stan
ford hallmarks. I used that article to pro
vide the first annual report on the slate ol
our coniniunit) as Dean ol Students.
While I continue to believe Stanford is
truly a spec ial place, ii is not perfect. While
Stanford for the most pan is generalh .1
safe* campus, it is not insulated from threats
to coininunit\ such as ads of intolerance
that often times are crime-related. While
some ads are played out in .1 ver\ public
setting and receive significant media atten
tion, many others take place far removed
from the media spotlight. Ii is for this tea-

son that I believe the
I tii\ersii\ community
will benefit from m\
periodicalK reporting
on ac is ol intolerance' on
campus, in addition to
sharing the progress we
continue to make in both
preventing and
responding to these

harmful ads.
Since this past summer, I have been
made aware ol nine distinct incidents on
campus ol ads ol intolerance. I he majot it\
ol these reported incidents have been
offensive e-mails, main ol litem emanating
from oil-campus (and reflective ol how
technology can easih be misused). Othei
reports include repeated oflensive letters
received through the I .S. 111.til bv an eth
nic (ointnuniiN center, a racist and sexisi
promotional liver, repeated trashing ol a
golf cart limiting the tnobilih of a disabled

student and use of a hurtful stereotype. It
is likeK there are other events that were
nevet reported.
I hreats to our communis come in
main lot nis. I hese threats can be subtle
.md innocent; a simple comment made one
on one. I he\ c an be public, intentional and
inllainmaioiA, such as racist e-mails. ()i,
the) can be innocent and unintentional,
such as forgetting to park out bicw les to
maintain access foi those in wlieeli liaiis.
1 he Student Affairs stall at Stanford
einplovs a protocol to address ac is ol intol
erance on campus. It is a program with
nine pi inc iples that guide the steps we take
to acknowledge, disc iiss and overcome
such ac ts in ordei to keep the lominunih
whole: prevention. security. communica
tion, education. civic dialogue, collective
responsibility coniniunit) caring, assess
ment and reporting. I invite students to
support these principles. Anvone who is
concerned about an event that mav under

inine the coinnninit\ should report it to
Â«ii i\ Student Affairs stall. Staff are also avail
able to stucli'iits to hear their concerns.
It is important to know that the I niver
sit\ reacts quickly and decisively on all
reported ads of intolerance. A variet\ of
agencies on campus, (such as Stanford
Police, computer security, residence deans,
( owell Student Health, Dean of Students,
Religious 1 .ilc. community center direc tors
and others), mobilize quickly to provide
support and comfort to the injured indi
vidual or group; conduct confidential
investigation into the fads of the reported
incident; and then hold responsible indi
viduals ac countable lor their actions.
As we strive to respond to and prevent
acts of intolerance on campus, the values,
principles and beliefs of this institution
guide us. lu an Amendment to the Found
ing (.rant. Jane Stanford articulated that
her and her husband s "moving spirit" li>r
founding the I niversit) was their "love of

humanity and a desire to render the great
est possible servile to mankind.'' She went
on to add, "1 lie I niversit) was according
ly designed lor the betterment of mankind
morally, spiritually, intellectually, physical
ly and materially." In essence, the Stan
lords wanted to empower students to make
the world a bettei place in which to live
when they left the farm.
I lie pl ot ess of preparing students to
assume positions of leadership and inllu
ence in the world is articulated in part bv
the I niversity's Fundamental Standard,
established ln David Starr Jordan, the I ni
versitv's first president, in 1N9(). It states:
"Students at Stanford are expected to show
both within and without the University
such respect for order, morality, personal
honor and the rights of others as is
demanded of good citizens, failure to do
this will be sufficient cause for removal
