Kach quarter, Stanford stu
dents have the option of en
rolling in the University-provid
ed Cardinal Care health plan.
About 55 percent of students
choose to join the plan, while the
others rely on private insurance
coverage.
"Our concern at Cowell is that
all students are covered, regard
less of which plan," said Ira Fried
man, the director of Cowell Stu
dent I lealth Service.
Cowell treats students the same
regardless of their insurance (ov
erage.
"At Stanford, all students have
access to Cowell Student Health
Service," Cowell's Web site says. It
says that set vices are geared to all

members of the Stanford commu
nity and makes no forceful push
for students to enroll in the Cardi
nal Care plan.
Cardinal Care, in which stu
dents can enroll when they regis
ter for classes on Axess, costs $211
per quarter.
According to Friedman, stu
dents with HMO coverage from
their home area may have a diffi
cult time seeing specialists in the
Bay Area for non-emergencies.
"Otherwise, out-of-area insur
ance is fine," Friedman said.
All students, regardless of their
insurance plans, can receive free
X-rays from Cowell and get their
prescriptions filled at Cowell's
pharmacy.
According to Friedman, since
Cardinal Care is "specifically de
signed for students," it provides

"very good coverage" at "modest
prices." For example, under Car
dinal Care, a student can lie treat
ed in the Emergency Department
of the Stanford Medical Center for
only $50 if they are then admitted
to the Stanford 112 lospital.
"Under other plans, emer
gency care may cost the student
lots more, perhaps hundreds of
dollars," Friedman said. He still
encourages students to look at all
of their options.
For the upcoming school year,
Cardinal Care has made a few
changes by partnering with
Health Net, a California-based
health care provider with a nation
wide network of doctors. Until the
start of the 2000-'()l school year,
off-campus care will be adminis
tered by Blue Cross and Blue
Shield of America.
