# Bridging E.P.A. 'digital divide'
## New technology programs, Stanford volunteers help area

President Clinton's visit to East Palo Alto and the
increasing importance of the Internet in American
life have highlighted the "digital divide" that
threatens to exclude underprivileged communities
and minority groups from tin* technological revo
lution.
Not only do such populations lack ac cess to tech
nological resources, but they also lack the skills
needed to profit from a job market that is becom
ing more dependent on workers with technical
training.
Clinton's visit to East Palo Alto was no accident.
Ii is one of the Hay Area communities that has been
targeted by programs seeking to increase Internet
access and help people develop computer skills.
Plugged In, a computer access center in East
Palo Alto that has Stanford students on its staff, is
one organization focused on the technological edu
cation of East Palo Alto citizens.
It was also the site of President Clinton's visit and
one of the programs he praised while in the area.
"At Plugged In people get to be creative and be
come more educated. We teach people how to use
technology in a creative, productive way," said
Vanessa Flemmitig, a senior and art director for
Plugged In.
"When we talk about a digital divide, we're talk
ing about issues that are a lot more complicated
than computer access, issues like racism and clas
sism."
"I think [the digital divide] exists, but it is in large

part a question of income and wealth differences
between minorities and whites," said Professor of
Education and Economics Martin Carnoy. "In the
sense that there are more opportunities and high
er income available to people with computer skills,
but well before the digital divide, large economic
differences existed between minorities and whites."
According to Provost John Hennessy, "Knowl
edgeable people rather than computers will be
what is in short supply. I do believe that we need to
be concerned about the digital divide since it will
disadvantage future generations of potential col
lege students. This is my biggest concern."
I leightened awareness of the socioeconomic ob
stacles to universal Internet access has also attract
ed new business to East Palo.
Most recently, former NBA star Earvin "Magic"
Johnson has hired Alamode Graphic Design, a
company run by East Palo Alto teenagers, to design
business cards for his new company, Urban Magic.
Alamode Graphic Design designs business, holiday
and personal greeting cards and operates out of
Plugged In.
The community center also helps students run
P-I Design, a Web page design business that creates
Web pages for companies such as Packard Bell and
Cisco.
Many critics say that Stanford, as well as Silicon
Valley companies and community programs, has a
responsibility in helping to bridge the "digital di
vide."
"President Clinton's visit allowed us to make a
connection with Silicon Valley and East Palo Alto
that probably wouldn't have previously been
made," Elemming said.
"It was a chance for the community to come to
gether and build momentum. That's more of
[Plugged In's] mission than making people com
puter savvy."
