Dr. Vidya Dehejia spoke last night on her exhib
it at the Smithsonian earlier this year on Devi.agod
dess and representation in Asian art. "Devi: The
Great Goddess" fixused on the many representa
tions of the goddess Devi in Indian, Tibetan Bud
dhist and Chinese culture.
Dehejia is the asscxiate director and chief cura
tor of the Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur M.
Sackler (iallery at the Smithsonian Institution.
Devi functions both as a warrior goddess, pro
tecting the universe in some myths, and a maternal
nurturer in others.
The exhibit was divided into six "functional" cat
egories: goddess as cosmic force, the giver, the
heroine and beloved, social protector, semidivine
and auspicious, and women saints.
"I devised a new set of categories that I hoped
would make the exhibition meaningful, both for
my peers and colleagues and for the general pub
lic," Dehejia said.

I ler goal was to create lx)th an appealing art ex
liibit for the layman and an enlightening cultural
representation for the connoisseur.
"For the casual visitor, I wanted them to come
out thinking, 'Oh this is beautiful' and 'This god
dess must be important in this culture,'" she
said. "But for the more involved viewer, 1 want
ed to bring out the paradoxical nature of the
g< )ddess."
The lecture, co-sponsored by the Society for Art
&( Cultural I leritageof India,a Bay Area organiza
tion dedicated to promoting Indian culture, and
the Stanford Center for Buddhist Studies, began at
7:30 p.m., and nearly 100 Stanford and communi
ty members attended.
Carl Bielefeldt, a Religious Studies professor
and co-director of the Stanford Center for Bud
dhist Studies, welcomed the audience.
1 le said that Indian culture was always of inter
est to the Asian Religions and Cultures Initiative,
which encourages understanding and apprecia
tion at Stanford of Asian cultures.
"One of our main fix/uses [with the Initiative]

was India, whose rich culture has been largely ig
nored," Hielefeldt said.
He then introduced (iursharan Sidhu, the pres
ident of the board ofdirectorsof'SACHl. Sidhu ex
pressed pleasure in joining Stanford to celebrate
Indian culture.
"As a Stanford alumnus," he said, "I was ready to
give Stanford quite a tongue-lashing for ignoring
India, but you [Bielefeldt] iu:ve redeemed the Uni
versity."
In her lecture, Dehejia also discussed the impli
cations of creating an exhibit.
She described how creating an exhibit takes the
objects out of their contexts and puts them "in a new
narrative. "The very act of choosing and displaying
objects is weighted," she said.
Dehejia has been a curator at the Smithsonian
for six years. Prior to that, she was an associate pro
fessor in the Department of Art History and Ar
chaeology at Columbia University.
She has published many books on Indian art
and is currently working on a photography exhibi
tion, "India Through the Lens, 1840-1911."
