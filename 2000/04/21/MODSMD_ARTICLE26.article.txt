### MEGHAN O'CONNOR STAFF WRITER 
For the No. I I Stanford men's volley
ball team, a roller-coaster ride ol ;i season
tilled with unexpected injuries, inexperi
enced freshmen, upset victories and frus
trating losses all comes down to one
match.
Tomorrow night, Stanford (10-12, ( .)-l I
Mountain Pacific Sports federation) will
face No. 2 Pepperdine (20-4, Ki-.'i) on
enemy ground in the fiist round of the
MPSf playoffs, lloth teams will be playing
to stay alive in the single elimination tour
nament that sends its champion to the
\'( IAA tournament.

'file winner of Saturday's match will go
on to play the winner of co-No. 2 L'SC 1 and
No. 7 I lawaii in the semi-finals.
Stanford heads south coining off a two
game losing streak, while Pepperdine
boasts a string of two wins as well as a victo
ry over the (Cardinal in the only match-up
between the two teams in the regular sea
s< )11.
While the Pepperdine Waxes came
awa\ with the win in February at Maples
Pavilion, Stanford was not pummeled by
the Pepperdine wake that crashed over
teams throughout the season. The two
teams battled for three hours before Stan
ford fell in foin games. 15-10,14-H), 15-11,
15-12.

"1 think it is a source of confidence lor
us," said head coach Ruben Nieves, refer
ring to February's match. "We were very
competitive with them early in the year,
and we've improved a lot since then. For
Pepperdine, they know that we're capable
and sec us as a threat."
Familiarity with its opponent will be an
asset to both teams this weekend as each
team will try to enter tlie match with an
edge.
"Both teams will have good information
on the opposing team," Nieves said. "It's
the team that's better at executing its game
plan that's going to win."
Stanford's game plan will focus on con
taining Pcpperdine's top hitters, senior

Andre Breuerand junior Scott Wong. The
pair lalls seventh and tenth in the confer
ence with kill averages of 5.97 and s.f>l, re
spectively.
Stanford freshman Curt Toppel leads
both the conference and the country with
an 8.70 kills-per-game average.
Wong also ranks second in the confer
ence in aces with .493 aces per game, while
junior teammates Donny killian, Keith
Barnett and freshman Brad keenan follow
at eighth, ninth and tenth.
keenan and killian combine for a
strong middle blocking force as the two are
both in the top ten in the conference with
hitting percentages above .400. Defensive
ly, keenan plates seventh with a blocking

average of I.(>(>.
Meanwhile, Pepperdine will have its at
tention on I oppel, who matched Breuer
wiili 'M') kills in the teams' earlier match-up
lor the game high. In the upset victory
against No. I Long Beach State, Toppel hit
a conference-high 50 kills over the course
of the live-game match.
Sophomore Marcus Skacel has been
Stanford's most complete player this sea
son, placing second on the team in kills per
game with 4.36 and first in bloc ks with
2.57, a mark that puts him ninth in the
country.
Setting for Stanford is junior Josh
Lukens, currently third in thecoun
117 tor assists pel game behind IVp
pel dines Kurt Nelson, with ltt.9iS.

Mentally, pressure from playofl
survival and I'eppei dine's home
court advantage will add into Stan
lord's formula for success.
"As important as tactics and
strategy is how we go about com
peting in .1 plavofl match," Nieves
said. "Are we lonised and tough

enough to siav positive through
rough spells."

"Kxecuting under pressure is
more important than ever," \icves
said. "It challenges your ability to
be in position to (arry out voin as
signment from pln\ to plnv."
As I<>i being the underdog, the

Cardinal is used to it. With seven
freshman and one senior, Stan
lord was ranked No. 1 I in the pre
season poll and not picked to be a
threat to teams like Pepperdine,
which was ranked No. But
Stanford's win against l.ong
Heath State and strong plav

against other top teams turned
heads and proved that the Cardi
nal should not be discounted.
"We understand that we're the
underdogs," Nieves said, "but we
know we have a shot, and that's
all we need. If things go right we
can do it."
