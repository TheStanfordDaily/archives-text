# Women face UCLA, USC at Taube
## 
### BILL HANSON STAFF WRITER 
If the top-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team can get
past both LCLA and USC this
weekend, it w ill wrap up its
regulai season with a perfect
25-0 dual match record and se
cure the Pacific 10 Conference
team crow n,
"We've only had a couple of
undefeated seasons before
this," said bead coach Frank
Brennan. "So it's quite an
achievement. And we won't let
that achievement go down the
drain if we don't win the
NCAA's."
Both the Trojans and the
Bruins, however, won't go
do\yn without a light. Although
the Ordinal beat both squads
easih two weeks ago, Brennan
remains concerned.
" I hey're both quality
teams," be said. "LCLA is a little
tougher than USC. UCLA is al
ways very talented, but they've
been jinxed with injuries over
the past few years, and this year
is no exception. You never
know what their line-up is
going to be when they show
up."
I he Bruins are led by Sara
Walker, ranked sixth in the na
tion, and senior Annica (looper.

The Trojans are led by Kara
Warkentin and freshmen up
starts Jewel Peterson and Anita
Loyola.
Ironically, the Bruins cur
rently seem healthy, vet Stan
lord has recently been plagued
by injuries.
Freshman Laura Granville,
the nation's fourth-ranked
player, is still sidelined with
torn ligaments in her ribcage.
Gram illc, who in February won
the I 1A Rolex National In
doors, the third leg of the colle
giate grand slam, will definitely
be healthy in time for the Pac
-10 individual competition at the
end of April. Her participation
in this weekend s matches, how-
is uncertain.
n "Granville's questionable for
the weekend," Brennan said.
"Right now, she can hit every
thing except her serve."
Senior Feryn Ashley, who
spent the first part of the season
recovering from tendinitis in
her wrist, is currently strug
gling with a new injun — pains
in her lower back. As a result,
Ashley's pla\ has been erratic
over the past few weeks— occa
sionallv brilliant, occasionally
dismal.
