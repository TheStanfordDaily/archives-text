# Grad students turn out in lower numbers

Disillusionment or disinterest in
the ASS I —whichever it maybe —
was again present this year among
graduate student voters, who
showed up at the polls in compara
tively low numbers. Only 24.70
percent of the graduate student
population cast ballots, dooming
the first group to seek a graduate
onlv special fee, the (Graduate
Women's Network, which needed
1,097 "yes" voles to pass, and re
ceived 1,066.
With only 1,706 of the 7,244
graduate students casting votes,
numbers were ver\ l<>w f< >r some <>112
the (.raduatc Student Council's
slots: I listoi \ graduate student I.ise
Sec Ire/, look the (-S( 1 Humanities
seat withonh two voles, the lowest
number in ilic election guarantee
ing a win.
Big winners ibis year included
social sciences graduate student
C.orinna l.oc kenhoff, w ho took an

at-large seal with 663 votes, natural
science graduate student Chris
Stromberg, another at-large mem
ber with 661 votes. Law School stu
dent ly Clevenger in an at-large
slot with 540 votes and King 1 .am as
one of the engineering representa
tives with 41'1 votes. The CSC is
composed of If> students.
I he numbers this year were much
higher than voter turnout in the
1008 election, in which little over
ten percent of graduate students
cast their votes, despite then-candi
date and later ASSU President
Maren Norton's emphasis on grad
uate student needs in her cam
paign platform.
"I don't think that grad turnout
[in this year's election] w as really all
that low — it might have been a bit
lower than what we'd hope for, but
it w as probably about what we'd ex
pect," said senior Kric Albert, the
ASSI Klections Commission tec h
nical direc tor. "It's only really no
ticeable because the CWN fee fell
short clue to a lack of votes."

I lit* (.W'N, which was short <>!
'51 voles for a win. was requesting
$14,'H0 in special fees. Kven
though f>7.4.'5 percent of voters
were in favor ol the group ("> 1") said
"no" to a (i\\ \ special fee), gradu
ate special fee approval requires
that 15 percent of the graduate stu
dent population he in lavor, a task
indeed, considering lli.il voter
turnout was less than ten percent
higher than this requirement.
"It's interesting to note thai over
200 gracl students voted and didn't
cast a vote for the (AVN either
way," Albert said. "If the percent
ages held upand IT>of'thosepeople
had c ast a ("ves 'l vote on the fee, it
likely would have passed."
I he (.W'N. which is an ac aclein
ic, support, information and acti\i
ties network for graduate women,
lias been in existence lot the past 20
years, and has largeh relied on
fund-raising to support its pro
gramming — which it will likeh
have to do again in the upcoming
year.

Albert said that the fact that
other combined special fees passed
is a sign that graduate students are
interested in them.
"The fact that the (.W'N fee
came close to passing show s that it's
c learl\ possible lot a grad-onlv fee
to succeed, w hie h helps to clear up
a few misconceptions about special
fee s."' Albert said. "That the com
bined fees also passed among grad
students, all but one, that is, also
shows that grad students are inter
ested in special fee groups and will
ing to contribute to them."
Last year, the graduate student
turnout wasovei ten percent high
er, at 37.f> percent, which most
then attributed to the presence on
the ballot ol the constitutional
amendment to split the ASM' into
an undergraduate senate and
graduate student council. Despite
the larger turnout, there were still
many (.SC. candidates who scored
onl\ one vote within a number of
the schools. including business and
education.
