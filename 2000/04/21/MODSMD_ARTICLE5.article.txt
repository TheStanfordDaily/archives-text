### MARISA PAVLIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Ihe Hearings Committee is
investigating allegations of cam
paign violations against both
presidential slates, according to
junior Katie Voting, the hearings
officer.
"I'm verv thoronghh investi
gating all charges against cither
slate," Voting said. " The slates
chose to t.ike advantage of the 48-
hour rule, and this prevented me
from having a hearing before the
election. As hearings officer, my
dutv is to conduct investigations
on any allegations."
Ihe lleai ings Committee is
requTrect to give candidates fS
hours notice before calling them
in for a hearing.
"I don't impose penalties —I
recommend penalties to the
hearings committee, which is
made up of two undergraduates
and one graduate student. I liev
make the final call. They are the
judge and jury," Vnung said.
Both slates—Ben Liu and
Mike Hildas, and Setli Newton
and Malia Villegas, all juniors —
said they were waiting to hear the
formal charges against them.
"We're running a nice, clean,
fair campaign." s;ii< I Villegas. "It's
hard w hen you have a lot of sup
port to make sure everyone
knows the rules \t the heart
ol it. I trust our supporters."
I.iu expressed similai senti
ments.
"We've run a clean campaign,"
he said.
Newton said that it is difficult
to ensure that all of their sup
porters fullv understand the elec
tion rules.
"()ur campaign is .1 grassroots
campaign and bv its nature as a
grassroots campaign, we have
hundreds of volunteers who
aren't hearings experts in run
ning ASSI elections. Willi that
main students, people make
honest mistakes." Newton said.
Hildas stressed that he hoped
the c harges would be thoroughly
investigated.
'Tin concerned if [the viola
tions are] true, and 1 think it
should be looked into, Hildas
said.
Several students have alleged
that supporters of each slate sent
unsolicited e-mails to lists. Ac
cording to the ASM Campaign
Practices Code, "any unsolicited
e-mail — even a single e-mail —
is prohibited because* it violates
Stanford's computet usage poli
cy. All e-mail (<lll onlv be consid
ered 'solicited' it the recipient
willingh provided his 01 her e
mail address to the sender with
the knowledge that it could be
used lor purposes of campaign
ing. For this reason, e-mails to
lists are not permitted, except
where a special lee organization is
e-mailing its own list about the
special fee."
According to Young, "any stu

dent who believes they have in
formation about a potential viola
tion, or who received an e-mail
supporting or'asking them to vote
for either oft he presidential slates
should e-mail (or forward an e
inail) to rules(& election."
Junior Aimer Khan, a current
ASSU senator, said, "As someone
who's followed the campaigns
closely, a current senator and a
concerned student, I would hope
that neither takes advantage of
the rules. We're all under the
Honor (lode."
