the next one will »•
hit, but the University
will be ready for it.
Emergency food and
water is stockpiled, generators are
at hand, and medical care will be
available on campus.
Are YOU ready? Knowing what to
do can save lives, or at least make
getting through the calamity with
less stress and more comfort.
Whether it's a power outage,
earthquake, fire, or flood, the most
important thing is to stay calm.
Freaking out puts you at a definite
disadvantage.

Fortune favors the prepared, so
give some thought to how you'll
respond when disaster strikes.
Some tips:
■ Evaluate the spaces you're in -
residences, class rooms,
theaters, clubs, etc.; imagine
what you'd do if a disaster
struck, and take note of
evacuation routes
■ Carry the University's blue
and white wallet card with key
phone numbers (include an
out-of-the-area contact for
reassuring your family), or use
the one on the back of the flyer
■ Have a basic emergency kit
ready: eyeglasses, medications,
keys, jacket, shoes
■ Know where fire extinguishers
are and how to use them (call
725-1470)

desk; if you're in a hallway, sit
down against a wall (do not

in class, drop between rows of
seats or under a desk)
■ If you're in bed and can't get
under a desk quickly, cover
your head and stay there

stops; then leave the building
and don't reenter it until it's
okayed by University
engineers

A Useless
(but Intsreeling) Fact
The word "disaster" is based on
the Latin "dis" + "astrum" (from
Greek "astron" - "star") - derived
from astrological beliefs of being
"star-crossed" - hence our word
"dis - aster" (Source: Webster).
