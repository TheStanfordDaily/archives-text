Sororities are grow ing In leaps and
bounds, and not just in the Cowell
(Cluster.
1 his year's sorority rush, which ( ul
minated in bid da\ on April 4, had 224
pai ticipants. ()f the women joining the
rush activities, 137 pledged, a 29 pet
tent increase from last year's 122.
1 he housed sororities, Kappa
Alpha Theta, Delta Helta Helta and Pi
Beta Phi, Which will he housed begin
ning next fall, all i eported an iiu l ease
in the number ol pledges from last vear
to this veai. I he I betas had !<2 pledges
this year,compared to UO last vear. I lie
I ri-l)ells had pledges this year, an
increase from 29 last year.
I he Pi Phis saw their pledge ( lass in
crease from! 12 last year to !if> this year.
"We were ;i little nervous that our
status as a housed sororit\ would affe< t
rush turn-out, but the increased num
ber of rushees this year dispelled out
fears," said Pi Phi president |essica
Sisco, a junior. "It will definiteh lake

some readjusting, but we're expecting
great things from the transition."
Chi Omega, one of two unhoused
sororities, along with Kappa Kappa
(lamina, reported a pledge class of 2b,
seven more than their 1999 total of 19.
I lowever, the group said the) mav *till
accept more pledges. I he Kappas re
ported .i pledge c lass of 1, up from 29
last year.
Willi I he Draw coining soon after
rush, main rushees consider how join
ing .i housed sororil\ (ould affect their
draw groups.
"While it's sillv to believe that draw
groups and peer pressure don't influ
ence rushees' dec isions, its great to see
so many women interested in what the
Creek system has to oiler, regardless ol
the housed or unhoused status of the
son >i it ic-s on campus," said Sisco.
freshman Stephanie |oukolf, a Pi
Phi pledge, said, "A lot of people arc
scared to i iish because they don't want
to lose their draw groups, but people
will still be your friends, it they're your
c It>se friends."
Freshman Amanda Kalin, a 1 ri-
Delt pledge, said that she began rush
not wanting to join a housed sorority.
"b\ the end, though, those were just
the girls I liked," she said.
bids are oflcred aftei rushees visit
with members of ea< h sorority during

a four-da) process. IT the rushees ac
cept the bids they become pledges, and
at e considered 112 ull members after one
or two quarters of trial membership.
I he Pi IMiis will join the other two
housed sororities in C.owell Cluster
when they move into Whitman next
fall. I he'lVi-Deltsand I betas received
housing in the fall of 1098, becoming
the first sororities to be housed at Stan
ford since the 19405. I lie IVi-Delts now
live in the former A1 () house, while the
I betas live in what was Alpha Sigma.
Some students have expressed con
cern that Whitman is no longer part of
the draw.
"Whitman is a really tight dorm,"
said Jon Perkins, a junior. "A lot of my
friends live there. It seemed kind of
random that they just got kicked out."
While the majority of women who
rush tend to be freshmen, some up
pertlassmen do participate in the
pr< >cess.
"Sometimes 1 waver; 1 wonder i! 1
should have clone it. But I can always
do it next year," said Alii Widman, a
freshman who went through only two
days of the four-day rush process.
Sororities that are not part of the In
tersorority Council — .Alpha Kappa
Alpha, Delta Sigma I beta and Alpha
Kappa Delta Phi — did not participate
in ISC Rush 2000.
