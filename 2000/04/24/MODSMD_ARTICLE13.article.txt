## Elian spends Easter Sunday with his father in capital 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Elian Gonzalez spent a
secluded Easter with his father, insulated from the
clatter in two nation's capitals and a shaken Miami
over the armed raid used to take him away.
"Finally," said his father's lawyer, "some silence
around them."
After a day of raw anger, street fires and violence
in the Little Havana neighborhood, Miami lell quiet
for Easter celebration yesterday morning, still under
tight police control after more than 350 arrests.
"We will celebrate in tears," said Sergio Perez, a
Miami neighbor of the relatives who kept Elian for
five months until federal agents brandishing guns
burst through their door before dawn Saturday and
seized him. Later yesterday, scores of chanting
protesters returned to the neighborhood.
In Washington, near the heavily secured air
base where the 6-year-old Cuban boy is staying, a
congressional Republican leader "sickened" by the
use of force said hearings were certain on Capitol
Hill.
"This is a frightening event, that American citi
zens now can expect that the executive branch on
their own can decide on whether to raid a home,"
said House Republican whip Tom DeLay of Texas,
joining criticism made by George W. Hush, the pre
sumptive GOP presidential nominee, and Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi.
"There was no court order that gave them per
mission to raid the private home of American citi
zen," DeLay said, appearing on NBC's "Meet the
Press. "This has been a bungled mess."
But a top Justice official said the only regret was
that authorities waited as long as they did.
"We were forced into the action we took bv the

intransigence of that family," said Kric Holder,
deputy attorney general. "We probably should have
taken a decisive action sooner."
Holder, also on N BC, said a previous court ruling
upholding the government's general actions in the
case, combined with an order from the Immigration
and Naturalization Service, sufficed as legal grounds
for moving in.
He acknowledged concern by the administration
that Elian may be used by Cuban President Eidel
Castro as a political trophy.
"That is Fidel Castro's history." Holder said, "lie
has shown that he has always tried to use whatever
he can for his own political advantage."
Indeed, Castro called Saturday "a day of glory lor
our people" as some 4()(),()00 Cubans summoned to
a rally celebrated the father-and-son reunion.
Praising U.S. officials for their forceful action, the
communist leader declared a "truce" in liis enduring
Cold War-era struggle with the United St.ites, but
added: "Tomorrow the battle continues."
U.S. officials, anticipating Elian will go back to
Cuba when court appeals are through, hoped to
influence (luban officials on how the boy is treated in
his homeland.
Elian, for once, was out of earshot of all the fuss.
He joined his father, stepmother and baby halt
brother Saturday in private quarters at Andrews Air
Force Base, the home base 01 Ail Force One.
"Finally thev have some time together, some
space together, some privac\ together, some silence
around them so that the circus atmosphere and that
environment down in Miami (are) no longer inflict
ed upon this boy," Gregory Craig, lawyer for the
father, said on NBC's "Meet the Press."
