BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Money scat
tered 011 the floor. Money exchanged in high
stakes poker games. Money hidden under ducks
in the freezer. Briefcases full of money. Money
in trash bins. Money in ash bins. Money in bro
ken down trailers.
Big-money tales ai,;e nothing r\ev\ in,the 40-
year public saga of Louisiana's rougish four-time
ex-governor, Edwin Edwards. But thitirtime the
tales of money, money everywhere, could laud
him in a federal prison beyond what he calls his
"biblically allotted time."
"Look him straight in the eye and tell him
he's guilty," Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Harp
er told jurors during closing statements last
week near the close of his federal racketeering
trial.
After 16 weeks, the case will be in the jury's
hands today. Only a unanimous jury can convict
or acquit him.

Kclwards is ac cused of masterminding a series
of schemes to extort millions of dollars from
applicants for lucrative rivcrboat casino licenses
before and alter his final term ended in jaiiuara
1996. Also c harged are his son Stephen, a state
senator, a state gambling board member and
three of Edwards' friends. I heir trial started
Jan. 10.
If convicted on all counts, Fclwarc 7'2. faces
more than IiOO years in prison — a term he
joked lie would never serve.
Elected four times despite — possibK In-cause
of — his unabashed love of high-stakes gambling
and his reputation as a ladies man, Edwards In
his own count has been the target of ncarh two
dozen investigations.
A probe in the- 1980s into his investments in
hospital and nursing home deals led to two tri
als. I he first ended with a hungjnrv in 19S.">. I le
was acquitted in a retrial a year later.

1 his time, however, they had Edwards' own
words to use against him. With wiretaps and a
hidden microphone and video camera, the 181
secretly recorded 1 .">OO hours ol conversations
involving Kdwards alt>ng with his co-delcndants.
I"he prosecutions case also includes three
witnesses who claimed they paid extortion
money to Edwards and financial experts who
sa\ Edwards outspent his reported earnings.
Kdwards takes it in stride. With his 35-year
old wile on one side and his ">O-vear-old daugh
tei on the other, he sauntered into the court
house every da\ with his head held high.
I he witnesses sa\ the pavolls came in the
lorm of vehicles, appliances and cash. A former
casino owner, who said he keeps hundreds ol
thousands of dollars hidden under clucks and
deer in his freezer, said he sometimes left the
cash in trash bins or ash bins behind restau
rants or in a trailer behind his office.
