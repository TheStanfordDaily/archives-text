# Pope delivers Easter message to thousands

VATICAN CITY (AF) — Cap
ping a grueling Holy Week sched
ule, a weary-sounding Pope John
Paul II ottered Kaster wishes lor
peace in 61 languages and called
on the world yesterday to end
racism and xenophobia.
So many Holy Year pilgrims,
tourists and Romans turned out for
the pope's late-morning Mass in St.
Peter's Square that by the time he
delivered his Kaster message .it
noon, the crowd, numbering close
to 150,000, was spilling over into
the boulevard leading up to the
Vatican.
The faithful passed through
metal detectors recently installed in
the colonnade around the square
as part of security concerns over
the heavy Holy Year schedule of
public appearances by the pope.
Sounding tired toward the end
of the two-hour appearance, John
Paul expressed hope that the sense
of life associated with Kaster may
"overturn the hardness of our
hearts" and "impel individuals and
states to lull respect" for human
rights.
Praying for the success of peace
efforts around the world, including
in Africa and Litin America, the
pope cited "persistent tensions in
the Middle East, vast areas of Asia,
and some parts of Kurope."
"Help the nations to overcome
old and new rivalries, by rejecting
attitudes of rac ism and xenopho
bia," the pope prayed.
Unlike past years, the pope did
not single out any one country.
John Paul asked God to "grant the

human family of the third millenni
um a just and lasting peace."
Holy Week's many long public
ceremonies were a grinding chal
lenge for John Paul.
Hand and head tremors, associ
ated with Parkinson's disease, and
hip surgery six years ago make
moving difficult.
He made his way across the
square aboard a kind ol chariot —
a cart equipped with railings that
the pope can hold on to as he is
pushed by aides.
1 he vehicle is the latest Vatican
strategy to conserve the strength ol
a man who resists slowing clown.
The archbishop of Paris was
quoted in a Paris newspaper yester
day as saying that the pontill is suf
fering from a progressive paralysis.
"We know that his illness is caus
ing progressive paralysis of the
body but his mind remains intact.
This man, who was an athlete, is
becoming more and more a pris
oner in his body," C ardinal Jean-
Marie Kustiger was quoted as say
ing by Ke Journal I)u Dimanche.
The pope "retains a spiritual
strength, an intellectual capacity
and a memory, which are extraor
dinary for someone who will be SO
next month," Kustiger said, accord
ing to the newspaper.
John Paul was widely expected
to allow himself a few clays' rest at
the papal retreat in Castel Gandol
fo, a town outside of Rome, before
returning to the Vatican for his
next appearance — the April 30
canonization of a Polish nun,
Faustina Kowalska.
