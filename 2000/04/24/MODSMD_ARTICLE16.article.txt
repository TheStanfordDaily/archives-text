# NYU grad students to vote on unionizing
## 
### 
NKW YORK (AP) â€” In her
climb up the academic ladder,
Laura Tanenbaum teaches
freshman writing at New York
University while working on
her doctorate. It pays $11,500
tor a nine-month stint, a pit
tance in high-priced New York,
the 25-year-old complains.
What graduate teaching and
research assistants need is the
right to bargain collectively for
better pay and benefits, Tanen
baum and some of her col
leagues say.
This week, in a move NYU
officials warn could shatter aca
demic freedom but students
insist means survival, 1,400
graduate teaching and research
assistants at the university will
vote whether to form a union
represented by the United Auto
Workers.
A "yes" vote could make
NYU the first private American
university subject to collective
bargaining with graduate assis
tants. About two dozen public
universities already are.
"What we're looking for is
recognition from the university
that we're adults who provide a
service," Tanenbaum said.
NYU officials argue that
teaching and research duties
come with students' financial
aid packages, so they're not
workers entitled to a union.
They also sav private univer
sities lack the protection state
laws give their public counter
parts, such as curbing strikes
and bailing interference with
course content.
"It will be impossible, or vir
tually impossible, to separate
the educational issues from
employment issues." said
Robert Berne, NYI vice presi
dent for academic develop
ment.
Union organizers deny this.
"We are not looking for and
we clo not believe we could
legally obtain any say in cur
riculum.'' said Patrick
McCreery, !W, an NYU doctor
al candidate in American Stud
ies.
Ihe National Labor Rela
tions Board will supervise bal
loting set for tomorrow
through I hursday.

Last week, NYU appealed to
the NLRB to stop the election,
or at least hold results while the
board hears the case.
The agency said Friday that
the election would take place.
Unless it rules on the appeal by
Thursday, the votes will be
impounded until the case is
decided. Any outcome could be
challenged in federal courts.
1 lie university's case was
dealt a setback this month when
the NLRB regional director
ruled graduate teaching assis
tants are employees entitled to
organize. Excluded were scien
tific researchers paid by outside
funds.
What comes of the vote at
NYU could effect the 100 or so
private institutions among the
nation's 220 schools with doc
toral programs. Graduate assis
tants, primarily teachers and
researchers, nationwide num
ber some 200,000.
"We're a test case, and we're
entering into unchartered
waters," said Catharine St imp
son. clean of NYL s Graduate
School of Arts and Science.
Pitting graduate students
against their school could upset
collegia! tradition and threaten
academic freedom, said Jon
Fuller of the National Associa
tion of Independent Colleges
and Universities.
"These institutions are run
by collective governance,"
Fuller said. "By the same ratio
nale . . . the management of
General Motors couldn't form a
union. They run the place."
NYU teaching and research
assistants get tuition assistance,
stipends and other financial
help, and the financial packages
are good and improving, school
officials says.
Packages vary, but in the arts
and science school, assistants'
tuition and fees are free, the)
get money for child care, and
this fall the department's mini
mum stipend rises to $13,000
plus $400 for health care.
The number of state univer
sities with graduate assistants
unions has grown this past
decade to a couple dozen at a
time of growing financial pres
sure on schools and students.
