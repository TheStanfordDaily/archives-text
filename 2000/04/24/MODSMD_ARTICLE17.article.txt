## The 						Stanford Daily ASSU must address voting issues raised in the election 
### 
Published Since IX9I

Last week's elections evoked the
great est voter turnout in years, as
a record 59.7 percent of all under
graduates and 24.8 percent of all
graduate students voted on special fee
requests and ASSU candidates
Despite this high turn-out, graduate stu
dent voter turn-out and overall participa
tion was inadequate. Only I I candidates ran
for 1") spots in the Graduate Student Coun
cil. With continuing concerns about issues
such as graduate housing and fellowships, it
seems unlikely that there is simply no need
for full representation.
The unfortunate under-utlitzation of
opportunities for graduate representation
illustrates that graduate students were not

persuaded to vote nor to run for office.
Most advertising encouraging students to
vote and view the online Elections Hand
book targets undergraduates. The ASSU as
a whole and the Elections Commission in
particular must make a better effort to reach
graduate students as well if voter turn-out is
expected to increase.
The ASSU must also consider what low
turn-out means about the relevance of the
issues it addresses. The underlying under
graduate bias in many of Stanford's organi
zations must be met with greater efforts to
deal with concerns of the whole student
body.
In the wake of low graduate voter turn
out, groups such as the Graduate Women's

Network were denied funding despite win
ning majorities endorsing their special fee
requests.
The GWN fell short of the requisite 15
percent of the total graduate student popu
lation, despite receiving 67.4 percent of
votes in favor of their special fee request.
The GWN was the only group to apply fora
graduate-only special fee, suggesting that a
larger graduate voter turnout might have
produced a different result.
Senior Thomas Soule has submitted to
the ASSU an amendment to the ASSU Con
stitution. The proposed amendment would
consider a special fee request to have passed
if it receives a simple majority among voting
students.

This is a sensible amendment to the 15
percent rule. Atlhough that rule was created
to prevent "frivolous" fee requests from
passing, it has instead served to allow low
voter turnout alone to rob important
groups from much-needed financial sup
port.
Low voting rates are a sign that graduate
students feel the ASSU doesn't address
important issues or that the ASSU isn't a
truly representative body. Yet, not voting at
all does nothing to change that.
It is unfortunate that several student
groups — deemed valuable by other stu
dents — were denied funding simply
because not enough students decided to
vote.
