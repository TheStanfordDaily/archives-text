# WHAT THE HECK I'M TALKING ABOUT
## Is Stanford worth it? 
### 
Mali Damon laces oil a I lar
vartl simlent in a bar. I It
says: "Fifty years from now
you're gonna do some
thinking on your own and realize . . .
that you wasted 5150,000 on an educa
tion that you could've gotten for 51.50
in late charges at the public library."
Regardless of whether you've twisted
a CIV reading into a pick up line like
(his guy does in "Good Will Hunting,"
that scene mav feel

familiar.
Is Stanford worth
it?
I'm not asking
whether your grades
are worth 72 hours in
the Lair or the 24-
hour study room
(adjust figures to your
own personal night-

mare). I'm not asking
whether getting woi k done is worth the
years <>l sleep debt vou've accumulated
according to yom budd\ in Sleep and
Dreams.
Is Stanford worth the $!W,()()() dollars
we put down 01 borrow for ever)' year
we spend here?
Well, if I didn't think it was worth it,
I wouldn't he here anymore. Mere are
some of the reasons why I think a Stan
ford degree is worth .1 lot more than til)
public librai) card.
l irst, I think it's worthwhile to obtain
a college education. Sure, a person can
be successful in some fields without .1
degree. But I think it's ,1 whole lot easi
er with one.
If you're looking 101 any kind of con
ventional careei such as law, medicine,
any kind of business or education, thc\
most likely won't take a second look at
you unless you've got some kind of
degree.
People who are looking to go to gracl
school (or are in gracl sc I100I) know that
it's valuable to have the name "Stan
ford" atop their resume. I lie same
thing goes for people looking for presti
gious jobs — mail) high-tec h companies
and consulting linns recruit only at
Stanford and a few other choice institu
tions in the country. So it's clear that for
these jobs and aspirations, Stanford is at
least .m advantage.
Now il you're anything like me, you
might have thought that your letter of
admission was some kind of VIP card.
Von present it at the door of the com
pany where you want to work, and they
escort you to the corner office while
someone gets to work on printing your
business cards. Restaurants offer you
complimentary breakfast. You go to the

from of the line ai Disneyland. You get
out of jail free — once.
But by your freshman year, you
might have figured out like I did that
merely being a Stanford student won't
get you into Harvard Medical School or
Goldman Sachs, and it won't even guar
antee you an interview.
Even if you have a fairly good CPA,
there are tons of variables that will
determine to what extent you succeed at
the next level.
And sorry, the waiters at 111()P don't
think your little Stanford t-shirt merits
free pancakes.
So yes, Stanford is what you make of
it. Von could go through every quarter
without taking a break even fort hicken
tenders at Late Night, doing nothing
but classes and get very little return on
your $120,000.
Bui if you take a moment and look
around, ilic Stanford community has
much more to offer.
I lie quality ola Stanford education
lies in the contacts you choose to make
while you're here and tlie resources of
which you choose to take advantage.
I hat could mean talking to a profes
sor during office hours, leading to a
research position, leading to a new
interest, job contact or a great recom
mendation.
Ii could mean going to a (IDC work
shop, career lair or speaker panel and
(licking with someone from a great
company.
There are few places in this world
where you are surrounded by a com
munity <>l such intelligent, diverse peo
ple — that is, people from diverse back
grounds and with diverse interests.
Before Stanford, I never encoun
tered people who made me think so
much about who I am and what I'm
about in everyday conversation.
So even if you're like me, and you
don't see yourself headed down the
road of a very traditional career, or a
terribly lucrative profession, Stanford is
worth ii lor the amazing people here.
Talented writers and original
thinkers challenge me to think harder.
Friends and acquaintances who start
their own companies, go into the Peace
Corps and run entire service organiza
tions at the age of 21 make me realize
that as Stanford students, we can start
life now and do great things now.
How'd ya like them apples, Will
Hunting? 1 think Stanford's worth it if
you play your part.
