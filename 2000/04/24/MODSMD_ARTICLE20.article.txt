Senators-elect and class presidents-elect
support Liu/Dudas slate
As some of tlit* elected senators and
dass presidents for the 20()()-2()01 school
year, we would like to express our sup
port for the presidential slate of Ben Liu
and Mike Dudas. We believe that Ben
and Mike are the candidates best able to
unite the ASSU into a truly productive,
effective organization which can make
meaningful c hange on campus.
There is 110 question that Ben and
Mike will be an exemplary president and
vice president. They have already
demonstrated an ability to make palpable
change on campus. They have prepared
a list of objectives which is both substan
tial and plausible. They have an under
standing of what can be improved at
Stanford and how to do it.
Although the ASSU has accomplished
a great deal in the last year, there is still
far more for it to do.
The time has come to make the ASSU
what it should be: a bridge between the
students and the administration which
provides both student voice and student
services. This is the vision we share with
Ben and Mike, and we hope to spend the
next year working with them to make it a
reality.
We encourage the students of Stan
ford to join us this Thursday and Friday
in voting for Ben Liu and Mike Dudas,
the candidates who will truly be able to
put "students first."

PAC and The Daily need to inform stu
dents where Villegas is
The caption under Friday's photo
graph of ASSU presidential candidate
Seth Newton in The Daily read, "I lis run
ning mate, Malia Villegas, was unable to
attend the announcement last night."
However, The Daily did not specify
where Villegas was. In (act, The Daily has
failed to report this detail at all during
this election period. For the students'

information, Villegas is in Washington,
D.C. this quarter, participating in Stan
lord in Washington. The Daily and Seth
Newton's platform, the Platform for
Accountability and Change, has hidden
I his from the students' knowledge.
I he detail seems very significant
when, according to Section 4.2 of the
ASSU Constitution, 'The term of the vice
president shall end when another vice
president of the Association has been
elected by the Association." In other
words, the new vice president should
begin duties soon after the student elec
tion. Since Villegas will not be on campus
this quarter, if she is elected, she will be
unable to fulfill her role as vice president.
Seth Newton and PAC have not given
voters all the necessary information in
order to make an informed choice.
Instead, they concealed the fact that Vil
legas will be unable to participate in a full
month's duties as vice president. Mot e
over, this one month is an integral one, as
it should be used to adjust the newly
elected representatives to their positions.
If elected, Villegas will begin working
with the ASSU a month later than every
one else.
PAC has done an irresponsible job of
dealing with this issue. At the same time,
The Daily has been equally irresponsible
in failing to provide more information
than simply saying that Villegas "was
unable to attend" functions.
