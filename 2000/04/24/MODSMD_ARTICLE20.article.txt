Senators-elect and class presidents-elect
support Liu/Dudas slate
As some of tlit* elected senators and
dass presidents for the 20()()-2()01 school
year, we would like to express our sup
port for the presidential slate of Ben Liu
and Mike Dudas. We believe that Ben
and Mike are the candidates best able to
unite the ASSU into a truly productive,
effective organization which can make
meaningful c hange on campus.
There is 110 question that Ben and
Mike will be an exemplary president and
vice president. They have already
demonstrated an ability to make palpable
change on campus. They have prepared
a list of objectives which is both substan
tial and plausible. They have an under
standing of what can be improved at
Stanford and how to do it.
Although the ASSU has accomplished
a great deal in the last year, there is still
far more for it to do.
The time has come to make the ASSU
what it should be: a bridge between the
students and the administration which
provides both student voice and student
services. This is the vision we share with
Ben and Mike, and we hope to spend the
next year working with them to make it a
reality.
We encourage the students of Stan
ford to join us this Thursday and Friday
in voting for Ben Liu and Mike Dudas,
the candidates who will truly be able to
put "students first."

PAC and The Daily need to inform stu
dents where Villegas is
The caption under Friday's photo
graph of ASSU presidential candidate
Seth Newton in The Daily read, "I lis run
ning mate, Malia Villegas, was unable to
attend the announcement last night."
However, The Daily did not specify
where Villegas was. In (act, The Daily has
failed to report this detail at all during
this election period. For the students'

information, Villegas is in Washington,
D.C. this quarter, participating in Stan
lord in Washington. The Daily and Seth
Newton's platform, the Platform for
Accountability and Change, has hidden
I his from the students' knowledge.
I he detail seems very significant
when, according to Section 4.2 of the
ASSU Constitution, 'The term of the vice
president shall end when another vice
president of the Association has been
elected by the Association." In other
words, the new vice president should
begin duties soon after the student elec
tion. Since Villegas will not be on campus
this quarter, if she is elected, she will be
unable to fulfill her role as vice president.
Seth Newton and PAC have not given
voters all the necessary information in
order to make an informed choice.
Instead, they concealed the fact that Vil
legas will be unable to participate in a full
month's duties as vice president. Mot e
over, this one month is an integral one, as
it should be used to adjust the newly
elected representatives to their positions.
If elected, Villegas will begin working
with the ASSU a month later than every
one else.
PAC has done an irresponsible job of
dealing with this issue. At the same time,
The Daily has been equally irresponsible
in failing to provide more information
than simply saying that Villegas "was
unable to attend" functions.

PAC is a political party, not a platform
I he last thinn Stanford needs is its
own political parties. Yet the Platform
for Accountability and Change, despite
calling itself a "platform," is clearly a
political party. Platforms don't have
their own Web sites. Parties do. Plat
forms don t run "grassroots campaigns"
with "hundreds of volunteers." Parties
do. Platforms don't support a certain
slate for the presidency. That's what par
tics do.
Looking at our national party system,
1 think most Americans, and even politi
cians themselves, would agree that in an
ideal world there would be no parties at
all. Candidates would run on their own
merits and would be evaluated on their
own character and beliefs, not what
party they belong to. Well, at Stanford
we have that ideal world; at least we did
until PAC was formed. Let's not throw it
away.
Like a cold war, political parties are
viciously self-perpetuating. Once one
group forms a political party to mobilize
a group of voters and secure a competi
tive advantage, everyone else has to
lot in them or risk losing elections not
because they're less worthy, but only
because lliey can't match the power of a
part). II PAC continues to grow and
establish itself, rest assured that other
parties will soon appear.
112 he dangers of a party system emerg
ing at Stanford are obvious. Voters
would vote along party lines and pay less
attention to what candidates personally
stand for. I have already heard several
people sav that they voted for or against
people just because they are part of PAC.
PAC encouraged this behavior by post
ing "Support PAC" fliers urging people
to vote for the entire party as a group.
Another clanger is a divided and par
tisan ASS I senate. If a party manages to
get a presidential slate and several sena
tors elected to the ASSU senate, one
viewpoint would dominate the senate.
I lie party could drive legislation by get
ting people to vote along party lines. If
multiple parties form voting blocks in
the senate, we could see the kind of ugli
ness and divisiveness that often happens
in (longress.
I would urge the members of PAC to
disband the part) and stand up for their
beliefs on their own. Parties lead to'-par 1 -
tisanship, which nobody wants. Let's
vote for people, not for patties.

ASSU should amend the 15 percent rule
On Friday, the Graduate Women's
Network was robbed of a deserved special
fee victory by an extremely silly provision
in the .ASSU Constitution.
Fhe failure of the OWN fee assessment
was due to a clause in the Constitution
(Article V, Section 2e, Paragraph which
states that all special fee groups must
receive both a simple majority of votes
cast and a minimum of 15 percent of the
relevant voting population voting in
favor. The OWN won a two-thirds major
ity of votes cast, but fell 31 votes short of
the 15 percent mark. Even though (V7
percent of the graduate students who
voted in the ASSU election supported the
OWN, the fee failed to pass.
It should be said that this is not an iso
lated case. K.ZSU lost its spec ial fee back in
1996 on account of this rule; the station
received a clear majority but failed to
reach the 15 percent mark by 17 votes.
I have asked several ASSU officials to
explain why this rule is in place. Much as
I expected, they could not justify its exis
tence. In my view, the presence of the 15
percent rule does not make any sense and
should be done away with immediately.
Special fees are put to the students of
Stanford. They, in a democratic process,
decide if a group is worthy of financial
support. If the students find that their
money would not be well spent on a par
ticular group, the special fee for those
groups would fail. But if a majority of vot
ers decide that their money would be well
spent on a group, such as the OWN, then
the group should receive their fee request.
There is only one possible justification
that is occasionally offered â€” that such a
rule would prevent any 112 rivolous uses of a
student's ASSU fees. I do not agree with
that reasoning at all; to use the present
example, the graduate students dec ided
in a free election that the OWN was not
going to use their fee money irresponsibly
and therefore gave tliein their support by
a two-to-one margin. But, despite that
overw helming support, the OWN will not
receive special fee funding. And that is a
shame.
Sadly, given the fact that the ASSU
Constitution cannot be changed retroac
tively, this injustice will almost definitely
stand. I wish the OWN the best of luck in
their efforts to continue their work. Hut, it
is not too late to change the situation for
next year. The ASSU should put before
students a Constitutional amendment
that strikes out the 15 percent rule and, in
its place, write into the Constitution
something that makes a good deal of
sense: "A special fee shall be deemed to
have passed if a majority of those voting
on it were in.favor."
I' ask the newly-electecf senators, as
their first order of business, to approve
such an amendment and to schedule a
special election prior to next year's ASSU
spring election, so that such a miscarriage
of justice never occurs again.

Khactu's column was offensive
Perhaps Adrian Khartu should move
to Columbine and write flippant and fac
tnally incorrect columns about the "leg
endary" high school massacre.
1 here are many people in the Mathe
matics Department who remember Pro
fessor DeLeeuw, and Khactu's coverage
of his death was deeply offensive.

Clarifying financial aid changes
As a result of the Higher Education
Amendments of 1998, Stanford is required
to implement the Master Promissory Note
(Ml'N) for students borrowing Stafford
Loans through the federal 112 amily Educa
tion Loan Programs. As of July 1,2000, the
University must have in place a system for
students to complete an initial application
for the federal Stafford loan and at the
same time sign for future Stafford loan
funds borrowed through the same lender
similar to a line of credit.
This new method of delivering loans is
intended to eliminate the necessity for stu
dents to complete the same application
information year after year. One advan
tage of the MPN for students is that only
one promissory note must be printed and
signed; future Stafford loans can be pro
cessed without a new promissory note.
Although the process is changing, stu
dents are eligible for only the amounts
authorized by the TAO-according to feder
al regulations â€” which are $2,625 for
freshmen; $3,500 for sophomores; $5,500
each undergraduate year thereafter. Grad
uate students may borrow a maximum of
$18,500 per academic year in Subsidized
and Lnsubsidized Stafford Loan funds.
Students apply for financial aid for the
academic year 2000-2001 as they have in
prior years. ( The filing date lor under
graduates was April 15.) The FAO will
determine the applicants' eligibility for all
funds including federal Staflbrd loans and
begin notifying students of their awards in
July. As part of the award notification, the
student will be instructed to go to the Stan
ford Financial Aid Web site to complete
their initial Stafford loan application. ( This
is exactly as it worked last year.) I lowever,
when it's time to apply lor any additional
Stafford loan funds either during 2000-
2001 or iu future'yeafrsVfhe student Vvill go
to the designated Web Site and confjrin or
decrease the- amount lliey wish to borrow.
In the meantime, the FAO will have certi
fied the student's eligibility for Stafford
loans for the applicable academic year.
One concern is whether the increased
ease of borrowing will encourage our stu

dents to borrow more than is financially
healthy. Our c urrent default rate for fed
eral Stafford loans is .00 percent and we'd
like to keep it that low. Part of the chal
lenge is keeping our students well
informed about how their decisions can
affect their futures. Along with (his new
system will be the means for students to
review their loan history and model the
results of their borrowing and repayment
choices. Hopefully this new system will
provide even better borrower education
than we've been able to provide in the
past.

Remembering the Armenian Genocide
On April 24, 1915, 254 Armenian intel
lectuals were arrested in Istanbul and exe
cuted by the Ottoman Turkish Police. As a
prosperous religious and ethnic minority,
the Armenians were becoming too power
ful in the Ottoman Empire. Starting in
1915 and continuing until 1923, the Arme
nian Gencx'ide was the systematic effort by
the Young lurk government of the
Ottoman Kmpire to destroy every living
Armenian in and around I urkey.
1 he Armenians were persecuted for
their ethnicity; they were persecuted for
their Christianity. And the lurks nearly
succeeded. Approximately 1.5 million
Armenians were killed; more than 85 per
cent of the Armenian population of the
Ottoman Empire disappeared due to mur
der or so-called "relocation."
I he Armenian Geiuxide was one of the
most terrifying moments in history; today,
we shudder that the human race is capable
of such evil. Armenian mothers and
daughters were raped and killed by Turk
ish guards. Armenian men were sent to
deadly concentration camps not unlike
those of the I lolocaust, or forced on death
marches through the Syrian Desert. Scores
of Armenian women were even nailed on
crosses and crucified amidst taunts of
"Now let your Lord save you!" (Avakian,
I he Cross and the Crescent).
On April 24, Armenians around the
world remember this crime against
humanity in the hope of preventing fur
ther atrocities. On this, the 85th anniver
sary of the Genocide, only a few of the sur
vivors of this destruction remain. But their
stories still live on in the hearts of young
Armenians everywhere.
All is not done, though. The struggle
continues, as revisionism and misinforma
tion attempt to dominate the truth. To this
very day, the Turkish government refuses
to acknowledge its involvement in the
Genocide. We (16 not blame the Turks of
today for the hornfic actions of a previous
government. But, we do implore them
and the rest of the world to realize the
truth in the Genocide so that it may not be
repeated. If denials persist, there will be a
day when people do worse than forget
about the Genocide â€” they will never even

know that it occurred.
Although all of the recent American
presidents have acknowledged the
unspeakable violence perpetrated against
the Armenians by the Young Turk gov
ernment, Congress has still not passed a
resolution that recognizes the Turkish
actions for what they were: "Genocide."
What can we do? Get involved. Call your
senator or congressperson and urge the
adoption of such a resolution.
To us in the "Stanford Bubble," the
struggle for truth and justice seems far
removed from our daily life. Yet, an event
of note happened just two weeks ago,
essentially in our own backyard. The Daily
Cal (UC-Berkeley's newspaper) ran a story
referring to the Armenian Genocide as
"alleged." To give us no doubt as to their
revisionist philosophies, The Daily Cal
even published a "clarification" five days
ago, justifying this language.
They said, in part, the following: "The
Daily Cal's general reporting policy, when
referring to incidents that are in dispute,
whether by one or many, is to reference the
incident as disputed; in most cases, the pre
ferred word is 'alleged'"
Every major event in history can be labeled
as "in dispute." 1 guess Hie Daily Cal will fx?
using such language to describe the Jewish
Holocaust and the Genocide in Bosnia as
well, since there are multiple scholars who
contest both of them.
Such sentiments defile the names of the
1.5 million Armenians brutally murdered.
Worse yet, they allow such crimes against
humanity to be perpetuated. We, as young
Armenians, hope that acknowledgment of
the Armenian Genocide will come swiftly
by American and Turkish governments
alike, so that Armenians and Turks can
work on improving relations. For, without
memory of the past, without accepting the
atrocities that have taken place before, all is
lost: the vic tims are lost, the crimes against
them are lost, and â€” ultimately â€” we are
lost.

Association of Stanford University,
