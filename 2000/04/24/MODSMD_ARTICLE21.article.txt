### BRETT KAUFMAN STAFF WRITER 
I.OS ANCFFKS — Closer Jeff Bruksch, a Los
Angeles-area native and USC transfer, was
dying to make a difference in the past weekend
series at the rival I rojans" Dedeaux Field — and
did.
With the bases loaded, two outs, and a lull
count in the bottom wol the eighth inning Fri
day night, the sophomore struck out I 'SC. first
baseman Bill Peave\ to end a Trojan threat and
protect the No. 4 Cardinal's 2-1 lead.
Iu a tension-packed atmosphere, Bruksch's
third strike was dropped by senior catcher
Damien Alvarado, who grabbed the ball and
threw to first to force out Peavey. USC senior
Justin (iemoll streaked toward home plate from
third and slid past Alvarado, but the force play
a) first ended the inning without allowing the
run to score.
"It was .1 pressure situation, but being an ath
lete. that's what I live for," Bruksch said. "It's the
ultimate high right now."
Head coach Mark Marquess lauded the wav
his closer does not get nervous on the mound
and exudes a great amount of confidence in
tight spots.
"He doesn't shake," Marquess said. "He's
done it all year lor us, and he did a great job
again tonight."
Bruksch returned in the ninth to finish the
game and pick up his ninth save of the season in
one of Stanford's most exciting w ins of the vear,
4-1.
The victorv, paired with a I luirscla\ night
loss and Saturday win, left the Cardinal (31-10,
I 1 -4 Pacific 10CConference) tied for first place in
the Pac-10 with No. 3 Arizona State with onl\
nine games remaining on the conference schecl

ule for both teams. I SC. (27-17, N-7) trails the

breathing room Ibi junioi Jason Voting's sixth
win of the season and twelfth straight victorious
decision overall.
"The intensity was up the whole game,
Voting said. "After we went down a little bit 11-0
in the first|, I just rode on through and did niv
job knowing how big this game was lor us."
Junior Joe Borchard homered in all three
games of the series, including a Frida\ night,
fourth-inning bomb that gave the (Cardinal its 2-
1 lead, l he ball traveled an estimated 450 feet to
dead center field, lining over the hitter's bac k

yard all dav long.
Stanford knocked a season-high 23 hits on
Saturday in an impressive 18-4 thrashing of the
I rojans. I lie game remained close into the bot

baserunner alter USC third base
coach Andy Nieto's questionable
decision to send the runner.
Borchard's arm is one of the
best in college baseball, and down
two runs with plenty of time to play
and a bases-loaded situation, the
Trojans may have waited for ju
nior Josh PerselFs at-bat against
Gosling, who had not demonstrat
ed much control in his outing.
However, Nieto's risk did not pay
off for USG and ended the poten
tially big inning.
Borchard's home run in the
seventh, one of five Stanford
homers all day, was the bookend to
the big Cardinal inning. Stanford
went (jn to smack 15 hits and score
twelve runs in the final three in
nings of the game while keeping
the Trojans scoreless.
'The conditions were favorable
for the hitters all day long," Mar
quess said. "I felt that they domi
nated us offensively the first two
games . . . but we sure broke out of
that today."
At the tail end of the barrage, se
nior John Gall used his sixth plate
appearance of the game to extend
his career-high hit streak to 15
games with a leadoff'single to left
field.
1 lie two wins followed a disap
pointing opener that saw junior
Justin Wayne take only his second
loss of the season. His opponent,
junior Rik Currier, collected his
Pac-10 leading tenth win of the
season by holding the Cardinal to
three runs on four hits over his 6
2/3 innings of work.
The potential pitching duel
never materialized, as two of the
top pitchers in the conference
were not as effective as the)' had
previously performed.
Among the few highlights for
Stanford on Thursday was sopho
more Andy I opham's first career
home run. Topham provided an
encore performance to the feat by
homering again on Saturday.
The Pac-10 standings thinned
out considerably last weekend
after entering the Thursday games
with lour teams separated by just
two games. With both Stanford
and Arizona State winning two of
three from USC and UCLA the
weekend leaves the two front-run
ners one and a half games ahead of
UCLA in third place.
Stanford opens a five-game
homestand on Tuesday night, with
two non-conference games sand
wiching a Pac-10 series against Cal
ifornia at Sunken Diamond.
