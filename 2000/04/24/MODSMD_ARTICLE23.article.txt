## Men's volleyball falls to No. 2 Pepperdine Waves in five set thriller 
### MEGHAN O'CONNOR STAFF WRITER 
lake an underdog team with
seven players who've never
played in a college playoff match,
throw in two more benched with
injuries, add a senior facing the
end oi his career and somehow
you get a team that came within
three points of upsetting one of
the nation's top teams.
I he No. 1 1 Stanford men's vol
leyball team (10-13, 9-12 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) did
just that Saturday night in its first
round matchup with N'o. 2 Pep
perdine (21-4, 17-3) in the MPSF
playoffs, l he Cardinal forced
Pepperdine into five games be
fore falling 15-10, 15-8, 14-16, 13-
15, 15-13.
In classic Stanford volleyball
style, the men started slow and
took control late in the match to
give fans a thrill of a ride. Remi
niscent of Stanford's upset victory
against No. 1 Long Beach State
three weeks ago, the Cardinal
gave away two games before shift
ing the momentum in game three
and eventually forcing its oppo
nents into a fifth game.
But this time, Stanford waited
until Pepperdine had two match
points before clinching games
three and four.
"Not giving up," said redshirt
freshman Jon Palacios referring

to the team's strength Saturday.
"We've been down a lot in match
es but we haven't given up, we're
able to come back."
A major comeback was needed
after game two when Stanford
seemed to be drowning in the
wake of the Waves and time was
running out.
Game one was a tight side-out
battle marred with Pepperdine
service errors that Stanford failed
to capitalize on. A three point
string by Pepperdine put the
Waves up 9-6, then 12-8 and from
there Pepperdine closed out the
game.
Two stretches of three points in
a row followed by a string of two
points for Pepperdine kicked of!
game two and suddenly Stanford
was down 8-1. Stanford caught up
to 11-8 but as Pepperdine crept
closer to clinching the game, Stan
ford stayed the same. The squad
held off four game points before
the Waves ended the game with
out conceding anymore points to
Stanford.
"In the first two games, Pep
perdine really dictated the
match," said freshman Paul
Bocage. "They were playing their
game and we weren't stopping
them very well. Later on we start
ed to dictate and slow Pepperdine
down."
Undiscou r age d, Stanford
came out and secured three quick
points in game three. With the
Cardinal effort stepped up, a long
rally sent freshman Curt Toppel
sliding into the boards and sent
Stanford on a stretch that kept
- ~
Pepperdine scoreless and behind
9-2.
A comeback loomed just a few
points away for Stanford but Pep
perdine wasn't about to give up its
chance to end the match. With a
comeback ot its own Pepperdine
closed the gap at 11-10 and with
the service of Pepperdine junior
Keith Barnett, the Waves pulled
ahead to 13-1 1 and one point later
faced match point.
Stanford denied Pepperdine
two shots at sending the Cardinal
home without a game before red
shirt freshman Setli Ring served a
three-point stretch and Stanford
took its game back.
"1 thought we turned the
match around when Setli en
tered," said head coach Ruben
Nieves. "He did a nice job of giv
ing us an immediate emotional
lift."
"It came down to us gaining a
lot of heart and emotion for Josh,"
Jon Palacios said ol his brother,
the only senior on the squad. "We
didn't want to end it for Josh. We
wanted to keep going. We staved
focused and fired ii|)."
Stanford carried its momen
tum from game three into game
four, leading Pepperdine until the
teams were deadlocked at 10-10.

Bocage gave the Cardinal a boost
otl the bench as he replaced Jon
Palacios, who pulled a hamstring,
and notched two kills and block to
bring Stanford to game point.
Stanford gave up three more
points to the Waves but then se
cured the game bringing the
teams even at two.
"1 think the team started serv
ing a lot tougher," said captain
Josh Palacios of the team's turn
around. "We started dictating
what we wanted them to do with
our serves."
"Even though our hitting per
centage did not improve signifi
cantly, Nieves said referring to
the team's .278 and .213 percent
ages in games three and four,
"We slowed them down a lot
more in games three and four
with Seth, Brett and Paul on the
court."
Came five was an intense rally
score game. Two points for Stan
lord, one for Pepperdine, another
for Stanford then three more for
Pepperdine â€” the teams swapped
the lead to 10-8 when Pepperdine
broke away. Stanford survived
one match point before dropping
the fifth game, just three points
away from victory.
"Came live was a microcosm of
the whole match," Nieves said.
"Our hitting percentage was low
[.136 compared to Pepperdine's
.429] but somehow we were right
there. They had the advantage in

hitting effectively, we had the ad
vantage in serving."
Hitting percentages plagued
Stanford all night as its top two hit
ters, Toppel and sophomore Mar
cus Skacel each had one of their
worst hitting nights all season.
Tho Ugh T bppel led the team with
35 kills, he only tallied a .156 hit
ting percentage, while Skacel
recorded 11 kills and a .036 per
centage.
Jon Palacios boasted the high
est percentage at .647 with 13
kills, while freshman Hilly Strick
land notched a double-double
with a career high 13 kills and 10
digs.
Where Toppel left off offen
sively, he made up for defensively,
leading the team with a career
high 14 digs and seven blocks.
"It's a credit to the team that we
were in that match with [Curtis]
Graham out and Will Curtis out
and Jon, our best hitter of the
night, pulling his hamstring and
Toppel battling leg cramps that af
fected him in games four and
five," Nieves said. "But the flipside
is if Marcus, Brett [Youngberg]
and Curt hit anywhere like they're
used to hitting, maybe we win the
match."
"Overall it was an exciting and
fun match," Bocage said. "We
played well against a very tough
opponent. But it's disappointing
that we were so close and couldn't
come away with the victory."
