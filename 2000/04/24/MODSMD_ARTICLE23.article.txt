lake an underdog team with
seven players who've never
played in a college playoff match,
throw in two more benched with
injuries, add a senior facing the
end oi his career and somehow
you get a team that came within
three points of upsetting one of
the nation's top teams.
I he No. 1 1 Stanford men's vol
leyball team (10-13, 9-12 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) did
just that Saturday night in its first
round matchup with N'o. 2 Pep
perdine (21-4, 17-3) in the MPSF
playoffs, l he Cardinal forced
Pepperdine into five games be
fore falling 15-10, 15-8, 14-16, 13-
15, 15-13.
In classic Stanford volleyball
style, the men started slow and
took control late in the match to
give fans a thrill of a ride. Remi
niscent of Stanford's upset victory
against No. 1 Long Beach State
three weeks ago, the Cardinal
gave away two games before shift
ing the momentum in game three
and eventually forcing its oppo
nents into a fifth game.
But this time, Stanford waited

battle marred with Pepperdine
service errors that Stanford failed
to capitalize on. A three point
string by Pepperdine put the
Waves up 9-6, then 12-8 and from
there Pepperdine closed out the
game.
Two stretches of three points in
a row followed by a string of two
points for Pepperdine kicked of!
game two and suddenly Stanford
was down 8-1. Stanford caught up
to 11-8 but as Pepperdine crept
closer to clinching the game, Stan
ford stayed the same. The squad
held off four game points before
the Waves ended the game with
out conceding anymore points to
Stanford.
"In the first two games, Pep
perdine really dictated the
match," said freshman Paul
Bocage. "They were playing their
game and we weren't stopping
them very well. Later on we start

down."
Undiscou r age d, Stanford
came out and secured three quick
points in game three. With the
Cardinal effort stepped up, a long
