# Cardinal shuts out California
## Softball wins 2-0 as Mendoza ties the Stanford homerun record 
### EMILY DRESSEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Victory always seems just a little bit sweeter
somehow when its over the infamous Golden Bears.
( '.all it a "Cardinal" rule.
And this past weekend, the No. 12 Stanford soft
hall team (36-12,4-8 Pacific 10 Conference) was able
to relish in such glory after shutting down No. 9 Cal
ifornia Ml-l 5,3-9) 2-0.
Freshman pitcher Dana Sorensen threw the
complete seven innings and improved her personal
record to 19-6.
California threatened several times during the
first half of the game by posting runners in scoring
positions.
1 lowever, Sorensen was the vision of composure
on the mound and skated the Cardinal out of a
number of jams with a total often strikeouts.
After three scoreless innings, Stanford was able
to spice things up at the plate.
Sophomore centerfielder Jessica Mendoza an
swered with a lazer to right that sailed over the
bleachers in the- bottom of the fourth, tying the sin
gle season record for homeruns of nine that she set
last season.
In fact, Mendoza has so surpassed the competi
tion this year that she practically has no records to
break but her own from freshman year.
After her parade around the bases, the rest of the
line-up continued to pound away.
Freshmen Cassie Brangham and Maureen
I.eCocq each scattered singles to frazzle Cat's ace.
Jocelyn Forest, and cause a pitching change.
I he Bear's Nicole DiSalvio was equally unable to
stop the Stanford rally though, as junior third-base
man Jenni Shideler drove in a run off her outfield
single.
The inability to siring hits to
gether has plagued the Cardinal
all season long, as stranding tun
nels on base lias been all too fre
c|iient.
However, this inning against
the Bears exemplified what the
Cardinal hopes to continue
through the rest of its season.
" I lie fourth inning was big lot
us," Mendoza said. "Besides the
homerun, we had llu ee basehits in
a row. We never do that. We lm
the ball, but we never do it when
we need it the most. I his time
there were two outs and we ac tual
ly got the hit we needed. The bot
tom of the line-up stepped up and
did it."
Saturday's victory named the
Cardinal the series leader as both
Stanford and Cal had each won
one game at home prior to tins
weekend's match-up.
Both of Stanford's victories
came with the 2-0 score, and the
loss came alter a twelve inning
duel that ended with Cal winning
6-5 at Berkeley.
I he win over the weekend
gives Stanford an important edge
over the Bay Area rival, seeing as
the two teams have similar stand
ings in the conference overall.
Saturday's victon not only
brought perfect soft hall weather
but a boisterous army of young
musicians, lovingly known as I he
Band, to Stanford Softball com
plex.
The Band gave the field an
extra energy â€” the crowd, a hex>st
in its c heers.
"Fast year the last game of the
series was played at Cal." Mendoza
said. "Their band was so obnox

ious and rubbing ii in our faces
when we lost thai ibis year
brought poetic justice when our
band and the I ree tame out to
support us. | The Bears] always

seem to bring out the fight in us."
Tuesday, the Cardinal will take
011 Sacramento State in a non-con
ference doubleheader at home at
2 p.m.
