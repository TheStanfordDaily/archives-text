### SAMEER AHMED STAFF WRITER 
The third time was not the charm
for the No. 1 Stanford men's tennis
team.
After defeating No. 2 U( ILA (21-
3) twice earlier this year, the Cardi
nal was upended by the Bruins, 5-2,
Saturday afternoon in Los Angeles
in a non-conference match. With the
loss, Stanford finished its regular
season with an impressive 22-1
record, marking its 13th straight 20-
win season.
The day before, the Pacific 10
conference champion Cardinal de
feated No. Hi Southern California,
5-1, to sweep the season series
against the Trojans.
Because Stanford has defeated
UCIA two out of three times and
has not lost to any other team in the
country, the Cardinal will likely
enter the NCAA tournament as
the No. 1 seed when the 04-team
field is announced on May 4. Stan
ford is also expected u > he named as
one of 16 hosi sites lor the first and
second rounds on May 13-14. The
final four rounds of the NCAA
Championships will he held May
20-23 in Athens, (leorgia.
In Saturday s battle between the
top two teams in the nation, UCIA
took the early lead by winning two of
the three doubles matches and
never looked back.
"U( '1A is.i very good team," said
Stanford head coach Dick Could.
"We were veiy fortunate to beat
them twice this year. After losing the
doubles point, we dug ourselves in a
hole early, and they took advantage
of playing on the home court."
At No. 1 doubles, I ClA's fift.il
ranked tandem of Brandon Kramer
and Jong-Min Lee defeated senior
(ieoff Abrains and junior Alex Kim,
the No. 1 duo in the nation, 8-5.
After falling behind 4-1 early,
Kramer and Lee won seven of the
next eight games to post the victor) .
Abrains and Kim finished the
regular seasc >n with an amazing 32-5
record overall. They have also won
the doubles title at the II AAll-Ainer
lcan Championships and the Na
tional (lollegiate Tennis ('.lassie.
Stanford's only doubles win came
from juniors Ali Ansari and Scotty
Scott.. The Cardinal duo cruised past
Lassi Ketola and Travis Retten
maier, 8-3 at the No. 3 spot. Ansari
and Scott improved to 17-4 on the
year and have now won I I of their
last 12 matches.

UCIA then won four of the six
closely fought singles matches to
snap a three-match losing streak to
the C Cardinal, dating back to hist year.
I he Bruins clinched the victory
at No. 1 singles when No. 36 l.ee
held off Kim, ranked third in the na
tion, 7-0,6-4. The loss was Kim's first
in three meetings with Lee this sea
son.
Despite the loss, Kim has led the
Cardinal this year at No. 1 singles.
Posting a 35-0 record overall, Kim
has also won championships at the
1 I A Regionals and National Colle
giate Tennis Classic earlier this sea
son.
Stanford's two victories in singles
competition came from No. 12
Abrains and No. 94 Scott. Abrains,
the team's captain and only senior,
won his 17th straight match by de
feating No. 40 Kramer, 0-4, 7-0, at
No. 2 singles, while Scott improved
to 19-0 on the year with a 6-3,3-6,0-
3 win over Ketola.
Because the Cardinal had already
posted 4-3 wins against the Bruins at
the National Team Indoor Finals on
Feb. 27 and on Fhe Farm on Apr. 7,
the UCIA win this weekend might
not have a major impact on the seed
ing for the NCAA Tournament.
I lowever, Stanford needed to defeat
USC on Friday afternoon to solidify
its positional the top of the rankings.
Fhe Cardinal did just that by win
ning five of the six singles matches to
clinch the victoiy against the Trojans
(10-8).
Freshman David Martin pulled
off the biggest singles victory for the
(lardinal by upsetting No. 03 Daniel
Langre, 0-4, 0-2. With a record of
25-11, Martin has now won nine of
his last 1 1 matches.
Stanford also received victories
from Kim, Abrains, Scott and Ansari.
Fhe Cardinal's only loss of the
day was at No. 3 singles w here Ryan
Moore upset No. 13 sophomore K.J.
I lippensteel, 7-0,0-7,0-3.
After starting the afternoon with
singles play, the coaches mutually
agreed to cancel doubles play.
" I lie match began with singles
because there was a chance of rain,
which might have postponed or
canceled the match," Could said.
'Then, we would have had to play
on Faster Sunday, and neither team
wanted to do that. After we clinched
the win in singles, both coaches de
cided not to play the doubles."
Stanford returns to action at the
I'ac-lO Individual Championships
from April 27-30 in ()jai.

feating No. 40 Kramer, 0-4, 7-0, at
No. 2 singles, while Scott improved
to 19-0 on the year with a 6-3,3-6,0-
3 win over Ketola.
Because the Cardinal had already
posted 4-3 wins against the Bruins at
the National Team Indoor Finals on
Feb. 27 and on Fhe Farm on Apr. 7,
the UCIA win this weekend might
not have a major impact on the seed
ing for the NCAA Tournament.
I lowever, Stanford needed to defeat
USC on Friday afternoon to solidify
its positional the top of the rankings.
Fhe Cardinal did just that by win
ning five of the six singles matches to
clinch the victoiy against the Trojans
(10-8).
Freshman David Martin pulled
off the biggest singles victory for the
(lardinal by upsetting No. 03 Daniel
Langre, 0-4, 0-2. With a record of
25-11, Martin has now won nine of
his last 1 1 matches.
Stanford also received victories
from Kim, Abrains, Scott and Ansari.
Fhe Cardinal's only loss of the
day was at No. 3 singles w here Ryan
Moore upset No. 13 sophomore K.J.
I lippensteel, 7-0,0-7,0-3.
After starting the afternoon with
singles play, the coaches mutually
agreed to cancel doubles play.
" I lie match began with singles
because there was a chance of rain,
which might have postponed or
canceled the match," Could said.
'Then, we would have had to play
on Faster Sunday, and neither team
wanted to do that. After we clinched
the win in singles, both coaches de
cided not to play the doubles."
Stanford returns to action at the
I'ac-lO Individual Championships
from April 27-30 in ()jai.
