# Golf off to battle tough opponents
## 
### MATT LONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Arizona State boasts a top-five
ranking, five straight Pacific 10
Championships and the No. 1
golfer in the country. I his week's
Pac-10 Conference tournament
would be hard enough lor the
other nine teams without traveling
toTempeand fac ing the Sun Dev
ils in their lair.
Nevertheless, the 41st Pac-10
men's golf championships will
commence play Monday at
Karsten golf course, with one of
the most competitive fields in re
cent memory. Five of the teams
stand strong in the top-25, includ
ing No. 5 ASU and No. 21 Stan
ford.
The Cardinal comes into the
tournament with its six best
golfers, something rare for the
team as in the last few events head
coach Wally Goodwin has pre
ferred to play less experienced
duffers.
But the veterans practice daily,
and will go into the week after a
solid month of golfing weather at
the Farm. Stanford has already
qualified for the NCAA West Re
gional, so Tempe will just give the
team a taste of the fierce talent it
will meet on May 18.
"We're going down there with
as good of a team as we can take,
said Goodwin. "We'll play as well
as we can, but our main goal con
tinues to be the regionals."
The team is anchored by senior
captain Dusty Brett, its highest
ranked golfer at 75 in the nation,
and junior Alex Aragon. Fresh

men Ron Won and Jim Seki will
also make the desert trek, and
Goodwin looks to both for low
scores if Arizona State is to be chal
lenged. Seki is vastly improving, as
he recently carded rounds of 67
and 70 in a dual match at Pacific.
"Seki has been playing great,"
Goodwin said. "He got his hands
on a new driver and has gone from
a conservative style to playing ag
gressive. He hits his drives on the
fairway every time and has as good
of a tempo as anyone there."
Fhe last two spots will be filled
I)v juniors Eric Dahlberg and
Jimmy Lee.
Fhe squad will meet one of the
nation's best in Arizona State's ju
nior Paul Casey. Ranked No. 1 for
much of the season, Casey has
walked off with the last two Pac-10
individual titles.
Fhe Cardinal last captured the
tournament tide in 1994. Good
win's last season at the helm of the
team, his chance at a third Pac-10
Championship will ultimately de
pend on his team's focus and en
durance. It will take a strong finish
in each round to overcome the in
tense competition.
"We played [at Karsten] over
spring break," Goodwin said. "Its
not a long course but the last holes,
16-18, are a tough finish. I he last
holes decide every tournament for
a team."
Stanford begins with 36 holes
on Monday, and then plays a
round each on Tuesday and
Wednesday. The tournament has
standard scoring, with the top five
scores in each round counting to
ward the team's final score.
