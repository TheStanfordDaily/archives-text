Crime statistics for 1999 show an increase in alco
holic beverage violations on campus, as u ell as a con
tinued decrease in bicycle (licit.
Police recorded 1 14 alcohol violations, a peak for
the decade. 1 hat number was more than four times
the low of 28 recorded in 1994, and more than t\\ ice
the average number of 58 violations over the pre
ceding eight-year period. Police recorded 78 viola
tions in 1998.
Alcohol violations include minor in possession
(MIP) o flenses and drunkenness in public.
Lt. Del Bandy of the Stanford Police said that he
believes these statistics are too low, and that the ac
tual number of violations may have increased even
more than the statistics suggest.
Bands said he has been researching methods ol
reporting alcoholic beverage violations. He ex
plained that the numbers are based on incidents, not
arrests. If 20 Mil's are recorded in one incident, it
onl\ goes on the books as one violation.
"I am suspicious that they are going up even
more steeplv," Band) said.
But the increase in recorded violations ma\ not
neccssarih reflect an increase in alcoholic beverage
consumption In minors on campus.
According to Band), the increase in numbers
ina\ be influenced l>\ an increasing inclination to

consume alcohol in conspicuous locations. "We're
seeing an increase in M 1 Pout in the open, in public,"
Bandy said.
Bandy also said, however, that it a person be
comes so sic k as to need medical attention, the Stan
ford Police will not record the incident, which might
11 task the actual number of alcohol offenses.
Bike theft, phone harassment down
Reports of bike theft on campus in 1999 num
bered only 229, down from <i peak in 1993 of 829
thefts and from the eight-year average of 536 thefts
per year.
"Last year was the lowest in the 29 years I've been
here," Band) said.
" The University as a whole has focused on that
issue lor aw hile," Bandv said. 1 le said Stanford po
lice have been working with University planning
and transportation programs to reduce the problem
of bike theft on campus.
Band\ attributed the drop in bike theft to the in
stallation of new, more secure bicycle racks, as well as
more aggressive policies for removing abandoned
bikes left on racks over the summer.
lie said police expect to confiscate over 1,000
bikes left on campus this summer. Removing bikes
that are left In absent students, said Bandy, frees up

spate on the bikes lacks so that
people can lock their bikes more
securely.
Students are advised to take
their bikes with them when they
leave for the summer, as Bandy
said the Police Department does
not intend to serve as a storage la
cility.
Incidents of telephone harass
ment have also seen a downward
trend in the past few years.
The total number of incidents
of phone harassment last vear
was 97. Phone harassment
reached a peak of 218 incidents
in 1996.
The earlier high numbers of
harassing phone calls were large
ly the work of Simon Posada,
known as "Oscar," who was con
victed in April for making at least
400 obscene phone calls to fe
male students on campus over a
period of several years.
Bandy said that incidents of
phone harassment have gone
down since Posada's arrest.
Other campus crimes, such as
sexual offenses, computet theft
and vandalism, remained rela
tively unchanged from previous
years.
There were no rapes reported
to police last year and one inci
dent of sexual assault. Ten sexual
offense reports were written In
police.
Police recorded incidents
of computer theft and 99 ac ts of
vandalism.
"Overall, total crime . . . we
can say is down," Bandy said.
