# Students design for developing countries
## Engineering class focuses on cultural differences and economic constraints 
### CHRISTINA STANSELL 
Your assignment, should you choose to ac
cept it. is to design and build technology to lit
the needs of people in developing countries.
I 'he class that will teach you to do so: Mechan
ical Kngineering 128.
First taught last year, MK 128, "Design lor
.Appropriate Technology" features a lab com
ponent where students must solve three design
"i hallenges," such as building a solar-powered
water sanitizing system or a bicycle-based
vending vehicle.
Students meet once a week for lab, where

they design and build the technology. But the
c lass doesn't just involve working in tlu- shop.
Students must incorporate the cultural and
economic environment of developing coun
t lies into their design.
("caching assistant kelh Mavlor. a cotcrnii
nal student in civil and environmental engi
neering. said that classes such as this, which
"teach us to infuse social context with technol
ogy," are the reason "why most of us became
engineers."'
Alicia Lindslev.a junior majoring in product
design, said that she likes the class because in
other classes "we rarclx look at things other
than consumer products." She said the class
encourages students to "look at things interna
tionally and apph knowledge and experience"
to design better products.
I he ( lass was first offered last year b\ |efl
Spivack, alec turer in the mechanical engineer

ing department. According to mechanical en
gineering lei turer Warren Dean, w ho is teach
ing the class ibis vear, students have shown
strong interest in joining the class.
Students appK In filling out a registration
l< >i in and writing essa\ s. Fn roll men t is limited
lo 21 students. 14 ol whom participate in the
lab.
Despite student interest, the class is not es
tablished in the engineering curriculum. It is
re-evaluated on a yearly basis and will continue
only il there is stall support. Na\ lor and fellow
teai lung assistant Flliolt (lampbell. a cotcrmi
nal student in civil and environmental engi
neering, are not paid for their work.
Students learn design principles In build
ing established models first. According to
Dean, km >w ledge ol how the exist ing products

Students in MEI 28, appropriate design technologies, work on a wheelchair
made of inexpensive, everyday materials.
work gives students .1 basis Irom
which to design improved tech-
IK (logics.
I lc said students are cm 1 entl\
working on .1 project based on a
design l>\ Kail I lot< likiss ol
Whirlwind Whcclchuii Interna
tional, who spoke 10 the (lass
about the ( hallengeol designing a
wlieelt hail loi us*. I>\ people in
developing countries. Dean said
llotc likiss realized that hospital
wheelchairs break too easih and
require building materials that
are scarce outside ol the I nited
Slates.
Students will fust build a
wheelchair based on the

llotchkiss model. Those who
( hoose to woi k on the wheelchair
project will then redesign the
( hair to make it 10 inches ( loser to
the ground.
As Dean explains, "affordable
wheelchairs are a blessing, but
most ol lile goes on at ground
level in dc\eloping( ountries." I le
said cooking, chores and other
daily activities do not happen at
table level, as they do in the Unit
ed States.
"We hope to get to the point
w here we (an (ontribute to these
(ountries," said I)ean.
I lie class also features a one
unit lecture component, which
emphasizes research on new tech
nologies lor developing (oun
tries. Students must find an on
line report, two human contacts
and two organizations.

Dean said the contacts may
help with iiiture class projects.
Students ask about the cultural
situations of their contacts in
order to better understand what
technology would best meet lilt*
needs of that area.
MK 12N also provides intern
ship opportunities, 112 unded by the
Career Development Center,
with public-service organiza
tions. Many of the people that
speak to the ( lass and several in
ternship contacts are Stanford
alumni who have pursued, as
Naylor called it, "engineering as
a soi i;il service."
Dean said that students inter
ested in enrolling in the class next
year should express interest to of
ficials in engineering administra
tion so that the class will receive
adequate funding.
