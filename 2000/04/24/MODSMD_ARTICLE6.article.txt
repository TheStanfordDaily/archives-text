# Students design for developing countries
## Engineering class focuses on cultural differences and economic constraints 
### CHRISTINA STANSELL 
Your assignment, should you choose to ac
cept it. is to design and build technology to lit
the needs of people in developing countries.
I 'he class that will teach you to do so: Mechan
ical Kngineering 128.
First taught last year, MK 128, "Design lor
.Appropriate Technology" features a lab com
ponent where students must solve three design
"i hallenges," such as building a solar-powered
water sanitizing system or a bicycle-based
vending vehicle.
Students meet once a week for lab, where

they design and build the technology. But the
c lass doesn't just involve working in tlu- shop.
Students must incorporate the cultural and
economic environment of developing coun
t lies into their design.
("caching assistant kelh Mavlor. a cotcrnii
nal student in civil and environmental engi
neering. said that classes such as this, which
"teach us to infuse social context with technol
ogy," are the reason "why most of us became
engineers."'
Alicia Lindslev.a junior majoring in product
design, said that she likes the class because in
other classes "we rarclx look at things other
than consumer products." She said the class
encourages students to "look at things interna
tionally and apph knowledge and experience"
to design better products.
I he ( lass was first offered last year b\ |efl
Spivack, alec turer in the mechanical engineer

ing department. According to mechanical en
gineering lei turer Warren Dean, w ho is teach
ing the class ibis vear, students have shown
strong interest in joining the class.
Students appK In filling out a registration
l< >i in and writing essa\ s. Fn roll men t is limited
lo 21 students. 14 ol whom participate in the
lab.
Despite student interest, the class is not es
tablished in the engineering curriculum. It is
re-evaluated on a yearly basis and will continue
only il there is stall support. Na\ lor and fellow
teai lung assistant Flliolt (lampbell. a cotcrmi
nal student in civil and environmental engi
neering, are not paid for their work.
Students learn design principles In build
ing established models first. According to
Dean, km >w ledge ol how the exist ing products
