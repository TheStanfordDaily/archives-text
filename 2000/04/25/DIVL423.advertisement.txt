Journalism Internships
Work at a weekly newspaper in California and earn a reporter's
salary! Students can write and report the news, or work in advertising,
circulation, or production. Internships generally last about 12 weeks.
Here are some comments from past participants:
Intern for the San Francisco Business Times
"Instead of making copies and taxing paper, I had the opportunity to pitch and
write several stories. The editors and reporters at the paper treated me as a reg
ular staff member. . .As a result, I have at least 10 clips and business writing
experience which undoubtedly helped me land my current job as a staff writer
for a monthly marketing magazine."
Editor ol the Milpitas Post
"Our intern was most interested in sports reporting, so we used her as our
lead sports writer covering local teams. She also covered general assign
ment, and handled several specialty sections for all three of our papers."
Pick up an information sheet at Building 120, on the bulletin board
across from Room 453 on the Fourth Floor.
