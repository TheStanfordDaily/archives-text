## The
						Stanford Daily Presidential runoff signals good election year 
### 
Although many miciii call this
year's ASSI flections a somewhat less
than-principlecl affair, the fact remains
ili.it record voter turnout and impas
sioned issues dialogue have made this a banner
year in ASSU history.
I ndoubtedly, the vocal opposition that many
students and figures prominent in the ASS LI have
expressed for either side have made this quite a
troublesome election season, but, as a result, both
slates have also been compelled to analyze their
issues closely. Ihough the competition has been
presented under largely negative terms, it has, in
effect, had an ultimate!) positive influence on I lie*
slates and the election as a whole.
Finally, students are discussing why they sup
port individual slates, not in terms of the people
running, but rather in terms of the })!/itforms and

the actual issues being discussed. However obvious
that may sound, the fix t remains that elections, at
this level and on many others, are often decided on
publicity, popularity or personality.
I bus, the ASSI' and all those who participated
and/or voted in this election may, at least, take
pride in the prominent and serious role issues
played.
I lie high voter turnout and near-clean split of
voters on the presidential slates demonstrates
exactly how important this election was to students.
Nevei before have so many come out to vote in the
ASSI election in recent years, demonstrating a
clear and present interest in the outcome of this
election.
Beyond this, however, lies the matter of the
slates themselves. This year's slates, though at lac k
ing a good number of the same issues, came from

Published Since 1891

decidedly different backgrounds and seemed to
have <|iiiie opposite approaches to the ASSU and
student government in general.
I'he tremendous response to both slates indi
cates not only that great support existed on both
fronts, but, more importantly, that this election
meant, and means, something to two very impor
tant, very vocal and very committed groups of stu
dents at this University.
Though voter turnout and outpouring of sup
port may be attributed to the traditional election
devices, it appears as though Stanford students
have finally found an election of issues to mobilize
around, leading to the demonstrations of electoral
fervoi visible in recent weeks.
I hese voters' support will be tested again in the
runoff this coining week — will there be the same
kind of fervent rallying around candidates and

their issues, or will voter turnout be significantly
lower, as is traditional in runoff elections? Voters
need to make their voices heard again, but, more
importantly, the ASSU must publicize and pro
mote the runoff vigorously to ensure that it is an
accurate representation of voters' views.
As of yet, the runoff dates have simply been
posted on the ASSU Web site, but no readily
apparent steps have been taken to inform the vot
ing population of this new information through
fliers, e-mails or meetings.
Voters must understand the importance of the
upcoming election — the true test of their commit
ment — and the only way they will be better edu
cated about this and the runoff election in general
is if the ASSU takes an active role in promoting and
serving as an information source for the runoff
election.
