# MAISHA YA SHAMBA
## Something different 
### 
Did you know it's Africa Week? I
guess this is my one "plug" arti
cle, but, as ,i double major in
African and Afro-American
Studies (along with Economics — an
interesting mixture to sav tbe least), tins
week is pretty important.
Yesterday, White I'la/a became what,
in Swahili, would be a soko, or market.
Imagine, touches of a continent on the

polar opposite 112 rom us,
i iglit I it'iv at Stanford
,i hit surreal.
However, about
11 lose wooden giraffes
In I lie Bookstore —
I'm sorry to say that
\ou (an buy the same
ones in Bulavvayo for
about $0.30 if you bar
gain well enough (like

me). I lie sellei was not amused when I
tried lo bring hei down from $20.
1 odav, there's a showing of "Keita" in
I j, .iikl latei on this week there's every
thing fl <>lll a special showing of the
African (lolled ion in (lantor, to an entire
"All i» an Night" in Man/anita. From
Nairobi to Dakar, I amain 'asset to Bloem
lontein. there will be tastes and sounds
w I lit 1 i I guarantee you will never have
expei ienced before. I ake advantage of it!
Ii is these "expei ieiu ing-soinelhing
neus" ih.it I find to be the most impor
tant moments and events ol my Stanford
career.
I don't need to expand more, because
\oii .ill know ii jusi as well as I do. All 100
often I content myself with the normal:
BHQ on Friday, party in Lambda Nu,
read a little here, (heck my e-mail — but,
to he honest, well, it gets boring.
So 1 look foi something different. And
while Africa Week may not seem like
"something different" for someone who's
an African Studies major, let me tell you
that I'm not very familiar with West
African (lancing, and I've never had Fast
African cuisine. Flu-re's always sonic
thing more to learn ii seems, and it can be
exhausting knowing that a subject you
love will have no real end.
I .ike me, I'm sure vou've at some point
sought out something different. It can be
a daunting experience. As the tall, lanky
white guv, I sti< k oui like a sore thumb at
many of the events related to half of my
academi< side, but that's never really
mattered to me.
It's great that there are places here
where, though I may feel self-conscious
about it imself. the color of my skiu bears
absolute!) no meaning; I'm just as fasti
nated with the area of study as the next
K i| y-
I his is not an article intended for me

to pat myself on the back. I here have
been plenty of times where I have shied
away from similar events, or thought I
was too busy, or what have you. But
when that happens, I ask myself, why?
What was it that kept me from pursuing
a potentially great opportunity (and this
applies to anything, even beyond Africa
related matters) about what I was inter
ested in?
It's about this battle I have with my
mind and my environment — one that I
think we all have. We think we shouldn't
do something (or no good reason other
than that we're afraid of other's reactions.
It's kind of silly.
And so, I exhort, just go and freaking
do it. "Experience" — in tbe most
abstract and concrete ways tbe word can
possibly connote — because now is the
best time, and perhaps the only time,
before out lives get really started.
.All o! a sudden farm Lite sounds a bit
more exciting as "Maisha ya Shainba."
I'alin Drive becomes "Barabara ya
Mina/.i," and, yet, next week it will all
change again.
Kilter Dinkelspiel and become
immersed in the sounds of Bhangra at
Mela — welcome to India. Get transport
ed to the Burren of Ireland at the new
Yeats play (and see my buddy Colin talk
Irish), or just sit in Mem C.hu and feel as
if you were in some basilica in Europe.
All these pieces of our world are con
centrated in an area of less than a square
mile! I say, Stanford is not part of the real
world because tbe real world is instead
part of Stanfc>rd.
Who needs Council fravel when you
can bike there? I lie Bay Area is not all
plastic and asphalt — just try looking for
something different, and you'll find it's
right under your nose.
I'm not saying to attend some Africa
Week event (though that would be nice!),
but, this weekend or sometime soon, find
something you wouldn't normally do, but
that piques your interest — like a talk, or
a service, or a play, or something along
those lines. Then just go. See what hap
pens. You can leave after five minutes
(I've done that plenty of times) if it weirds
you out or seems completely boring.
As 1 said, you've all probably done this
before, but (as trite as it sounds) it is just
so cool. There's too much here I know 1
don't take advantage of often enough.
That's a scary thought when I see how
time is running out. So I'm just warning
you, if you haven't realized it already —
Stanford Life is short. Real short.

If you want to chill xritli CJiris, yon may do so
at cmalontyQideland. He hopes everyone is
enjoying midterms just as much as lie is.

white guv, I sti< k oui like a sore thumb at
many of the events related to half of my
academi< side, but that's never really
mattered to me.
It's great that there are places here
where, though I may feel self-conscious
about it imself. the color of my skiu bears
absolute!) no meaning; I'm just as fasti
nated with the area of study as the next
K i| y-
I his is not an article intended for me

to pat myself on the back. I here have
been plenty of times where I have shied
away from similar events, or thought I
was too busy, or what have you. But
when that happens, I ask myself, why?
What was it that kept me from pursuing
a potentially great opportunity (and this
applies to anything, even beyond Africa
related matters) about what I was inter
ested in?
It's about this battle I have with my
mind and my environment — one that I
think we all have. We think we shouldn't
do something (or no good reason other
than that we're afraid of other's reactions.
It's kind of silly.
And so, I exhort, just go and freaking
do it. "Experience" — in tbe most
abstract and concrete ways tbe word can
possibly connote — because now is the
best time, and perhaps the only time,
before out lives get really started.
.All o! a sudden farm Lite sounds a bit
more exciting as "Maisha ya Shainba."
I'alin Drive becomes "Barabara ya
Mina/.i," and, yet, next week it will all
change again.
Kilter Dinkelspiel and become
immersed in the sounds of Bhangra at
Mela — welcome to India. Get transport
ed to the Burren of Ireland at the new
Yeats play (and see my buddy Colin talk
Irish), or just sit in Mem C.hu and feel as
if you were in some basilica in Europe.
All these pieces of our world are con
centrated in an area of less than a square
mile! I say, Stanford is not part of the real
world because tbe real world is instead
part of Stanfc>rd.
Who needs Council fravel when you
can bike there? I lie Bay Area is not all
plastic and asphalt — just try looking for
something different, and you'll find it's
right under your nose.
I'm not saying to attend some Africa
Week event (though that would be nice!),
but, this weekend or sometime soon, find
something you wouldn't normally do, but
that piques your interest — like a talk, or
a service, or a play, or something along
those lines. Then just go. See what hap
pens. You can leave after five minutes
(I've done that plenty of times) if it weirds
you out or seems completely boring.
As 1 said, you've all probably done this
before, but (as trite as it sounds) it is just
so cool. There's too much here I know 1
don't take advantage of often enough.
That's a scary thought when I see how
time is running out. So I'm just warning
you, if you haven't realized it already —
Stanford Life is short. Real short.

If you want to chill xritli CJiris, yon may do so
at cmalontyQideland. He hopes everyone is
enjoying midterms just as much as lie is.
