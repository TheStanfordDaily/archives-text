Former ASSU vice president supports
Newton / Villegas
In yesterday's Daily ("PAC and lhe
Daily need to inform students where Vil
legas is"), (iabriel I .a/arin alleged that the
Newton / Villegas campaign has been
pat t of a vast conspiracy with l he Daily to
hide the fact that Malia Villegas is in
Washington, D.C. l he conspiracy accu
sation would be laughable if it were not
pari of a larger smear and rumor cam
paign cun eiitl\ targeting Seth and Malia.
As with last week's supposed e-mail scan
dal, the supporters ol Liu and Dudas
have once again got the facts wrong and
managed to overloi >k the olfenses of their
own campaign.
In this case, it is dear that although
Malia will miss the first few weeks of her
term, she is committed to staying at Stan
lord fi)i the entire summer, a commit
ment not shared by opponent Mike
Dudas, who is oil to an investment bank
ing job on the Kast Coast. It is true that
Malia will miss Dead Week and finals, but
it is a much more serious issue that, il
elected, Dudas will be absent lor the criti
cal summer months.
As a former ASSU vice president, I
know that over the summer, an essential
foundation lor the year is created and
relationships with administrators are
formed. I.iu, Dudas and their supporters
want the Stanford student body to vote
lor them because Malia will miss three
weeks, but what about the three months
that Dudas himself will miss?
I urge students to vote in the runoff on
the issues and to ignore the misinforma
tion, allegations and lies that are being
circulated. I urge you to vote lor Seth

Newton and Malia Villegas.

Newly elected student council, senate
members support Newton / Villegas
As a majority of the recently-elected
ASSU Undergraduate Senate, and sever
al members of the ASSU Graduate Stu
dent Council, we overwhelmingly sup
port Seth Newton and Malia Villegas to
lead the ASSU next year.
As has been said time and again, from
their extensive experience, both within
the ASSU and outside the ASSU in vari
ous student organizations, Seth and Malia
have proven their commitment to the
Stanford student body. Their ability to
bring diverse groups of students together
has culminated in the Platform for
Accountability and Change (PAC), a truly
grassroots effort that boasts nearly 100
active student volunteers.
As ASSU president and vice president,
Seth and Malia will bring these diverse
groups of students into the ASSU, ensur
ing that as many Stanford students as
possible have a voice in the University's
decision-making process.
Throughout the campaign, Seth and
Malia have been honest about their past
accomplishments and their opponents,
and clear about their vision for the Stan
ford student body. On a personal level,
Seth and Malia are genuine people, driv
en by their values and not their resumes.
They have the proven ability to take a
stand on the issues facing Stanford stu

dents, while, at the same time, listening to
and respecting opposing views. I hey will
bring all of these qualities to their roles as
ASSU president and vice president.
We urge the Stanford student body to
join us in supporting Setli Newton and
Malia Villegas lor ASSU president and
vice president. On April 27 and 28, cast
your vote for something more — the Plat
form for Accountability and Change.

PAC far more interesting
than a political party
While I applaud Nick Kapur's efforts
to sound like George Washington in his
letter yesterday warning against the intro
duction of a party system to Stanford, 1
think lie's a little oil the mark. Besides
choosing to ignore the fact that the Plat
form for Accountability and Change fully
intends to dissolve after the new ASSU
session begins (which renders most of
Kapur's arguments moot), PAC repre
sents something tar more interesting than
a political party.
Rather than driving "... legislation by
getting people to vote along party lines,"
as Kapur claims PAC would do, PAC can
didates actually want to introduce mean
ingful and progressive legislation to a
representative body where none current
ly exists. PAC] candidates embody a a
vision, not a party ideology, of making
Stanford University a more democratic
institution, with active participation from
a wide range of campus communities.
If Kapur really wants to criticize ideo
logically-driven "parties," he should take
a look at the current ASSU, comprised
primarily of one majority "party," the
"Sadly Hiding In Their F.go Actualization
Through Excessive Resume Stuffing"
party (which, to give them credit, actually
makes a better acronym than PAC).
While Kapur sees an "ideal world"
where "candidates .. . run on their own
merits and [are] evaluated on their own
character and beliefs," 1 see (or saw, until
PAC arrived) an election campaign where
flashy posters and stupid slogans ("Win
ston tastes good — like a Senator
should!") decide who gets to represent
the student body — not character, beliefs
or principles.
PAC candidates, unlike the majority of
the people currently serving in the ASSU,

are a group of serious individuals com
mitted to promoting tangible, positive
change in the way that this University
operates. That's why 1 voted lor PAC c an
didates last week, and that's why I plan to
vote for Newton and Villegas this week.
Call it whatever you want, PAC will
certainly make the ASSU a more interest
ing and potentially significant force on
campus. I'm all for that.

Support for PAC and concept of political
parties in general
Nick Kapur raised some very valid
points in his letter yesterday regarding
the action of political parties and the
effects that they might have on elections
at Stanford. I would like to point out the
positive aspects of such parties rather
then the trouble they cause.
Political parties serve an important
role in governments across the world.
They provide signals and dues to voters
about the position of the candidates in
those parties. They allow voters to make
rational choices in voting based on the the
candidates' parties.
I don't agree with Kapur's statement
that in an ideal world there would be no
parties. Without parties, people would
have a hard time making informed deci
sions. It may be true that party identifica
tion is an easy way out for people who do
not make the effort to become informed
about all issues and candidates, but in
reality the alternative is ignorance among
the majority of voters.
Regardless of whether you consider
PAC a party or a platform, it has given
students a way to support ideas they
agree with without knowing the candi
dates personally.
Some take issue with the fact that stu
dents voted the presidential slate and sen
ators running under PAC as a straight
ticket. Why not? Isn't this a more valid
way of choosing representatives than vot
ing for a few familiar names on a long bal
lot of people whose platforms seem unre
markable and unfamiliar?
Kapur stated that, with parties, "voters
would vote along party lines and pay less
attention to what candidates personally
stand for." I would say instead that, with
the existence of parties, voters are simply
more aware of candidates' principles, and
are able to vote lor what they stand foi
rather than voting for a familiar name.

PAC has offered the students a real
choice; they are looking to bring about
changes in the wav that student govern
ment operates within the University and
the importance of student voice here.
PAC candidates made it possible for stu
dents to make a well informed choice in
voting by identifying themselves as sup
porters of a unified platform, and 1 think
that this was a real asset to the election.
In my experience, student govern
ment elections often turn out to be more
of a popularity contest than a campaign
about real issues. It is unlikeh that the
average student w ill have a strong handle
on the issues each senate candidate per
sonal stands for, and therefore make
elese isions that are in no wav based on the
ideas or qualifications of those c andiates.
I urge the students ol Stanford to seri
ously consider the positive aspects of an
organization sik li as PA(! and not to sh\
away from voting for Setli and Malia
because of their connection to a party oi
platfoi m. Disbanding PAC, as kaput
suggested, would force students to vote
for people not parties, but it would .ilso
rob students of the opportunity to vote
for principles rather than people.
I, lor one, like the recent trend away
from a popularitv contest and towards
elections that represent real ideas, lake
this opportunity to become informed
about the issues that PAC. represents
before making a judgement about the
dangers of political parties at Stanford.

MIPs benign compared to bike thefts
In looking ,it today's article ("Alcohol
citations tip") 011 the in» reav. in the num
ber of MI IN.it strikes me that perhaps the
Stanford Police Department is inisallocat
ing resources.
I'lie distribution of Mil's is essentially
the prosecution of a victimless and rather
benign offense that does little but move
the offense (ch inking by Illinois) from an
outdoor to an indoor venue. Bicycle theft,
on the other hand, leaves victims in its
wake and is much more preventible by
successful prosecution of bicycle thieves.
Perhaps, I hen, ( Mlicer k. Bates and his
compatriots would do better to sit b\
bit \ le racks on a Saturday night instead of
outside of ( .is,i Italiana.

Help stop famine in Ethiopia
Once again we have begun to see the
all-too-familiar faces of hungry children
in the I lorn of Africa on our television
screens. As members of the Stanford
Kthiopian community, these images are
especially painful to us knowing that yet
again another disastrous famine is loom
ing over our country while the memory
of the horrifying pictures of 1984 is still
fiesh in our minds.
I he humanitarian disaster that is
unfolding in the region, unless quickly
prevented, is the largest famine in recent
inemorv. "In total, an estimated 15 mil
lion people are ai risk of food insecurit\
in the Horn of Africa in calendar year
2000," savs Prof. Falcon at the ('.enter for
Knvironmental Science and Policy at
Stanford L niversity.
Over half of this population (8.1 mil
lion) is in Kthiopia alone. I his is an
alarmingly large numbei of people at
risk iu contrast lo the wicleh publicized
1084 famine that killed approximately
one million people.
In the southeastern tow n of (.ode, it is
estimated that children under the- age of
live have been dying at the rate of a
do/en a day since February. It's been
four months since aid workers and the
Fthiopian government had first request
ed that towns like Code and Diliun be
given immediate assistance and thai a
million metric tonnes of food be dis
tributed to avert this famine.
Since then, I S. news sources like
I he Washington Post and (INN have
reported that between 8") and 90 per
cent of the livestock in ('.ode and sur
rounding towns have already perished.
Ihe Fthiopian government grain
reserves designed to avert famine disas
ters and once holding !}:">0,000 metric
tonnes of food have been diminished to
:">(),()()() metric tonnes.
In the midst of intense focus on other
international crises, attention has been
diverted too long from 11 iis catastrophe.
Relief is needed urgentl) in Fthiopia
and should not be ignored or the world
will once again be witnessing the repeat
of the 1984 famine, this time on a much
larger scale. (an rentlv, in Fthiopia near
ly eight million people are at risk of
dying from diseases, malnutrition and
starvation.
I he major cause of the c urrent food
shortage is three years of poor rains. It is
<i direct result ol cooler sea temperatures
in the Atlantic and Pacific ()ceans, which
have significantly reduced rainfalls in

Kast Africa.
For a region that heavilv depends on
farming for survival, the rains are critical
lor crop production. For the past three
years there has been severe shortage of
rain and this vear ii lias failed to come at
all.
W hat in.ikes this drought much more
devastating than the 1984 famine is the
fact that it is more widespread, covering
small isolated areas in 10 countries.
According to a recent Newsweek article,
one million people are affected in Soma
lia, which lias remained without a cen
tral government since the overthrow of
President Muhammad Siacl Bane in
1991.
Nearly a third of the Fritrean popula
tion is in danger of starvation, which has
been embroiled in blood\ boarder dis
pute after it invaded Fthiopian territory
in Ma\ of 1998. Millions more are at risk
in Sudan, Djibouti, Kenya, Burundi,
Rwanda, Uganda and 1 an/ania.
Fthiopian and I'.S. officials have been
forecasting the famine fot over a year,
but the international response have been
too little and too slow in this time of
urgent need. Currently, there are only
three emergence feeding centers set up
in the hardest hit ,;reas like Code and
Dihun.
According to BBC world service cor
respondents who have visited the area,
the feeding centers are equipped to treat
only the most severeh malnourished
children while thousands others wait in
turn to seek urgent help.
In the face of this pending humani
tarian disaster, we, the members of the
Stanford Fthiopian community, implore
the Stanford coiuinunitv to join our fight
against famine in Fast Africa.
We cannot sit idly bv until wrenching
images invade oui living rooms nightly
to react. In the words of a great human
itarian Martin Luther King, Jr. in a
speech given at Stanford in the late
19605. "I'lie time is alwavs tight to do
i iglit." Do right.
Contact the Stanford Fthiopian Stu
dents I nion at leabisaCcstanfbrd.edu if
vou would like to help.

"Janitors" column misses the point
I am writing in response lo I lie April 20
opinions column written bv Jennifer Wek
selbaum ( All I needed to know — I
learned in my (lining hall.")
Though I'm sure the Stern Cafeteria
taught her quite a leu lessons, perhaps
Wekselbaum should have paid more at
tention in Kcon I. Basic economic theory
serves to debunk some of the implicit un
derpinnings ol her arguments. 11 ere are
three inconvenient facts that have been ig
nored in the blaze of righteous indigna
tion:
First: I lie market does not pay well for
unskilled labor.
Second: Until automation can do the
job, there will always be a need for un
skilled labor.
Ihird: Inequality of outcome is at least
partly due to individual differences.
Let us examine the consequences tor
YVekselbauin's column. The first fact tells
us that the ease of replacing a worker is th
ree tl\ proportional to the time needed to
train a new one. While the politically tol -
led will bandy around terms like "sanita

tion engineer,' the truth is that janitorial
training likely consists of little more than
handing someone the mop and bucket.
II 8,500 janitors go on strike, there are
many unemployed people who are willing
and able to grab the opportunity. I his
means that wages are going to be low, as
the employer doesn't need to compete il
there are people hungry lor a job. ()n the
othei hand, Stanford students are a high
ly skilled group of people, and as the I di
versity wants to attract the best students
and keep thetn from going somewhere
else, part of the University's tactics involve
mandating high student wages.
1 he fundamental asymmetry lies in the
fact that janitors would not be able to do
the coursework of Stanford students,
while Stanford students would easily be
able to take on the job of a janitor.
Hie second fact tells us that there is al
ways going to be someone at the bottom of
the income pile, and that employing pres
sure tactics to make the janitors' contract
ing company increase their salaries is only
going to make the company less competi
tive in terms of price. It is not as if "highly
skilled" janitors will be attracted to those
companies with a higher wage.
I hat price increase gets passed on to
the student at least in part. I low main ol
the activists at the janitorial rally would be
willing to fork over $400 of theii personal

liiiids in appreciation <>1 the bathroom
(leaner? It's vers easy to put the blame on
the shadowy figures in the corridors of
power, bill the truth is that the student
population would not be willing i<> pas tin
extra mones lor something that gises
them little, il any, personal benefit.
I lie blow that the third fiict siukes,
however, is the most severe. No mallei
how much the activists will il to happen,
the lact that there are clillerences in peo
ple will not go asvas 1 . Not evei vone is smart
enough to go to Stanford, but sirtualls
everyone has the minimal level of intelli
gence required to be a janitoi
Note here that this does not mean that
till janitors are unintelligent, but ralliei
that intelligence is not .1 prerequisite lor
janitorial work. Intelligence is. however, a
prerequisite lor skilled work, and the mar
ket determined compensation lot skilled
work rises as the number of qualified indi
viduals lalls.
Thus, those who are more intelligent
would likely c hoose a job requiring more
skill due to the higher lescl of compensa
tion. The question of wliethei the intelli
gent have ibis choice in practice is dis
putable, but I feel that it is sale to sas that
there is not an agglomeration ol the bril
liant in the janitorial ranks. I 11 us the point
is thai the low wages of these workers are
in part due to the l;ic 1 that the) are not ca

pable ol doing more skilled laboi.
Finally, much is made ol the lac 1 thai
these janitors iiiusi support a fainils on ,111
SS-an-hour wage. W'ekselbaiini cites the
laniils who has converted to segctarian
ism Ibr cost leasons. \\ bile the 11011 ible in
justice of this can be debated, svhal is

Help stop famine in Ethiopia
Once again we have begun to see the
all-too-familiar faces of hungry children
in the I lorn of Africa on our television
screens. As members of the Stanford
Kthiopian community, these images are
especially painful to us knowing that yet
again another disastrous famine is loom
ing over our country while the memory
of the horrifying pictures of 1984 is still
fiesh in our minds.
I he humanitarian disaster that is
unfolding in the region, unless quickly
prevented, is the largest famine in recent
inemorv. "In total, an estimated 15 mil
lion people are ai risk of food insecurit\
in the Horn of Africa in calendar year
2000," savs Prof. Falcon at the ('.enter for
Knvironmental Science and Policy at
Stanford L niversity.
Over half of this population (8.1 mil
lion) is in Kthiopia alone. I his is an
alarmingly large numbei of people at
risk iu contrast lo the wicleh publicized
1084 famine that killed approximately
one million people.
In the southeastern tow n of (.ode, it is
estimated that children under the- age of
live have been dying at the rate of a
do/en a day since February. It's been
four months since aid workers and the
Fthiopian government had first request
ed that towns like Code and Diliun be
given immediate assistance and thai a
million metric tonnes of food be dis
tributed to avert this famine.
Since then, I S. news sources like
I he Washington Post and (INN have
reported that between 8") and 90 per
cent of the livestock in ('.ode and sur
rounding towns have already perished.
Ihe Fthiopian government grain
reserves designed to avert famine disas
ters and once holding !}:">0,000 metric
tonnes of food have been diminished to
:">(),()()() metric tonnes.
In the midst of intense focus on other
international crises, attention has been
diverted too long from 11 iis catastrophe.
Relief is needed urgentl) in Fthiopia
and should not be ignored or the world
will once again be witnessing the repeat
of the 1984 famine, this time on a much
larger scale. (an rentlv, in Fthiopia near
ly eight million people are at risk of
dying from diseases, malnutrition and
starvation.
I he major cause of the c urrent food
shortage is three years of poor rains. It is
<i direct result ol cooler sea temperatures
in the Atlantic and Pacific ()ceans, which
have significantly reduced rainfalls in

Kast Africa.
For a region that heavilv depends on
farming for survival, the rains are critical
lor crop production. For the past three
years there has been severe shortage of
rain and this vear ii lias failed to come at
all.
W hat in.ikes this drought much more
devastating than the 1984 famine is the
fact that it is more widespread, covering
small isolated areas in 10 countries.
According to a recent Newsweek article,
one million people are affected in Soma
lia, which lias remained without a cen
tral government since the overthrow of
President Muhammad Siacl Bane in
1991.
Nearly a third of the Fritrean popula
tion is in danger of starvation, which has
been embroiled in blood\ boarder dis
pute after it invaded Fthiopian territory
in Ma\ of 1998. Millions more are at risk
in Sudan, Djibouti, Kenya, Burundi,
Rwanda, Uganda and 1 an/ania.
Fthiopian and I'.S. officials have been
forecasting the famine fot over a year,
but the international response have been
too little and too slow in this time of
urgent need. Currently, there are only
three emergence feeding centers set up
in the hardest hit ,;reas like Code and
Dihun.
According to BBC world service cor
respondents who have visited the area,
the feeding centers are equipped to treat
only the most severeh malnourished
children while thousands others wait in
turn to seek urgent help.
In the face of this pending humani
tarian disaster, we, the members of the
Stanford Fthiopian community, implore
the Stanford coiuinunitv to join our fight
against famine in Fast Africa.
We cannot sit idly bv until wrenching
images invade oui living rooms nightly
to react. In the words of a great human

speech given at Stanford in the late
19605. "I'lie time is alwavs tight to do

"Janitors" column misses the point
I am writing in response lo I lie April 20
opinions column written bv Jennifer Wek
selbaum ( All I needed to know — I
learned in my (lining hall.")
Though I'm sure the Stern Cafeteria
taught her quite a leu lessons, perhaps
Wekselbaum should have paid more at
tention in Kcon I. Basic economic theory
serves to debunk some of the implicit un
derpinnings ol her arguments. 11 ere are
three inconvenient facts that have been ig
nored in the blaze of righteous indigna
tion:
First: I lie market does not pay well for
unskilled labor.
Second: Until automation can do the
job, there will always be a need for un
skilled labor.
Ihird: Inequality of outcome is at least
partly due to individual differences.
Let us examine the consequences tor
YVekselbauin's column. The first fact tells
us that the ease of replacing a worker is th
ree tl\ proportional to the time needed to
train a new one. While the politically tol -
led will bandy around terms like "sanita

tion engineer,' the truth is that janitorial
training likely consists of little more than
handing someone the mop and bucket.
II 8,500 janitors go on strike, there are
many unemployed people who are willing
and able to grab the opportunity. I his
means that wages are going to be low, as
the employer doesn't need to compete il
there are people hungry lor a job. ()n the
othei hand, Stanford students are a high
ly skilled group of people, and as the I di
versity wants to attract the best students
and keep thetn from going somewhere
else, part of the University's tactics involve
mandating high student wages.
1 he fundamental asymmetry lies in the
fact that janitors would not be able to do
the coursework of Stanford students,
while Stanford students would easily be
able to take on the job of a janitor.
Hie second fact tells us that there is al
ways going to be someone at the bottom of
the income pile, and that employing pres
sure tactics to make the janitors' contract
ing company increase their salaries is only
going to make the company less competi
tive in terms of price. It is not as if "highly
skilled" janitors will be attracted to those
companies with a higher wage.
I hat price increase gets passed on to
the student at least in part. I low main ol
the activists at the janitorial rally would be
willing to fork over $400 of theii personal

liiiids in appreciation <>1 the bathroom
(leaner? It's vers easy to put the blame on
the shadowy figures in the corridors of
power, bill the truth is that the student
population would not be willing i<> pas tin
extra mones lor something that gises
them little, il any, personal benefit.
I lie blow that the third fiict siukes,
however, is the most severe. No mallei
how much the activists will il to happen,
the lact that there are clillerences in peo
ple will not go asvas 1 . Not evei vone is smart
enough to go to Stanford, but sirtualls
everyone has the minimal level of intelli
gence required to be a janitoi
Note here that this does not mean that
till janitors are unintelligent, but ralliei
that intelligence is not .1 prerequisite lor
janitorial work. Intelligence is. however, a
prerequisite lor skilled work, and the mar
ket determined compensation lot skilled
work rises as the number of qualified indi
viduals lalls.
Thus, those who are more intelligent
would likely c hoose a job requiring more
skill due to the higher lescl of compensa
tion. The question of wliethei the intelli
gent have ibis choice in practice is dis
putable, but I feel that it is sale to sas that
there is not an agglomeration ol the bril
liant in the janitorial ranks. I 11 us the point
is thai the low wages of these workers are
in part due to the l;ic 1 that the) are not ca

pable ol doing more skilled laboi.
Finally, much is made ol the lac 1 thai
these janitors iiiusi support a fainils on ,111

Former ASSU vice president supports
Newton / Villegas
In yesterday's Daily ("PAC and lhe
Daily need to inform students where Vil
legas is"), (iabriel I .a/arin alleged that the
Newton / Villegas campaign has been
pat t of a vast conspiracy with l he Daily to
hide the fact that Malia Villegas is in
Washington, D.C. l he conspiracy accu
sation would be laughable if it were not
pari of a larger smear and rumor cam
paign cun eiitl\ targeting Seth and Malia.
As with last week's supposed e-mail scan
dal, the supporters ol Liu and Dudas
have once again got the facts wrong and
managed to overloi >k the olfenses of their
own campaign.
In this case, it is dear that although
Malia will miss the first few weeks of her
term, she is committed to staying at Stan
lord fi)i the entire summer, a commit
ment not shared by opponent Mike
Dudas, who is oil to an investment bank
ing job on the Kast Coast. It is true that
Malia will miss Dead Week and finals, but
it is a much more serious issue that, il
elected, Dudas will be absent lor the criti
cal summer months.
As a former ASSU vice president, I
know that over the summer, an essential
foundation lor the year is created and
relationships with administrators are
formed. I.iu, Dudas and their supporters
want the Stanford student body to vote
lor them because Malia will miss three
weeks, but what about the three months
that Dudas himself will miss?
I urge students to vote in the runoff on
the issues and to ignore the misinforma
tion, allegations and lies that are being
circulated. I urge you to vote lor Seth

Newton and Malia Villegas.

Newly elected student council, senate
members support Newton / Villegas
As a majority of the recently-elected
ASSU Undergraduate Senate, and sever
al members of the ASSU Graduate Stu
dent Council, we overwhelmingly sup
port Seth Newton and Malia Villegas to
lead the ASSU next year.
As has been said time and again, from
their extensive experience, both within
the ASSU and outside the ASSU in vari
ous student organizations, Seth and Malia
have proven their commitment to the
Stanford student body. Their ability to
bring diverse groups of students together
has culminated in the Platform for
Accountability and Change (PAC), a truly
grassroots effort that boasts nearly 100
active student volunteers.
As ASSU president and vice president,
Seth and Malia will bring these diverse
groups of students into the ASSU, ensur
ing that as many Stanford students as
possible have a voice in the University's
decision-making process.
Throughout the campaign, Seth and
Malia have been honest about their past
accomplishments and their opponents,
and clear about their vision for the Stan
ford student body. On a personal level,
Seth and Malia are genuine people, driv
en by their values and not their resumes.
They have the proven ability to take a
stand on the issues facing Stanford stu

dents, while, at the same time, listening to
and respecting opposing views. I hey will
bring all of these qualities to their roles as
ASSU president and vice president.
We urge the Stanford student body to
join us in supporting Setli Newton and
Malia Villegas lor ASSU president and
vice president. On April 27 and 28, cast
your vote for something more — the Plat

PAC far more interesting
than a political party
While I applaud Nick Kapur's efforts
to sound like George Washington in his
letter yesterday warning against the intro
duction of a party system to Stanford, 1
think lie's a little oil the mark. Besides
choosing to ignore the fact that the Plat
form for Accountability and Change fully
intends to dissolve after the new ASSU
session begins (which renders most of
Kapur's arguments moot), PAC repre
sents something tar more interesting than
a political party.
Rather than driving "... legislation by
getting people to vote along party lines,"
as Kapur claims PAC would do, PAC can
didates actually want to introduce mean
ingful and progressive legislation to a
representative body where none current
ly exists. PAC] candidates embody a a
vision, not a party ideology, of making
Stanford University a more democratic
institution, with active participation from
a wide range of campus communities.
If Kapur really wants to criticize ideo
logically-driven "parties," he should take
a look at the current ASSU, comprised
primarily of one majority "party," the
"Sadly Hiding In Their F.go Actualization
Through Excessive Resume Stuffing"
party (which, to give them credit, actually
makes a better acronym than PAC).
While Kapur sees an "ideal world"
where "candidates .. . run on their own
merits and [are] evaluated on their own
character and beliefs," 1 see (or saw, until
PAC arrived) an election campaign where
flashy posters and stupid slogans ("Win
ston tastes good — like a Senator
should!") decide who gets to represent
the student body — not character, beliefs
or principles.
PAC candidates, unlike the majority of
the people currently serving in the ASSU,

are a group of serious individuals com
mitted to promoting tangible, positive
change in the way that this University
operates. That's why 1 voted lor PAC c an
didates last week, and that's why I plan to
vote for Newton and Villegas this week.
Call it whatever you want, PAC will
certainly make the ASSU a more interest
ing and potentially significant force on
campus. I'm all for that.
MARK SILVER

Support for PAC and concept of political
parties in general
Nick Kapur raised some very valid
points in his letter yesterday regarding
the action of political parties and the
effects that they might have on elections
at Stanford. I would like to point out the
positive aspects of such parties rather
then the trouble they cause.
Political parties serve an important
role in governments across the world.
They provide signals and dues to voters
about the position of the candidates in
those parties. They allow voters to make
rational choices in voting based on the the
candidates' parties.
I don't agree with Kapur's statement
that in an ideal world there would be no
parties. Without parties, people would
have a hard time making informed deci
sions. It may be true that party identifica
tion is an easy way out for people who do
not make the effort to become informed
about all issues and candidates, but in
reality the alternative is ignorance among
the majority of voters.
Regardless of whether you consider
PAC a party or a platform, it has given
students a way to support ideas they
agree with without knowing the candi
dates personally.
Some take issue with the fact that stu
dents voted the presidential slate and sen
ators running under PAC as a straight
ticket. Why not? Isn't this a more valid
way of choosing representatives than vot
ing for a few familiar names on a long bal
lot of people whose platforms seem unre
markable and unfamiliar?
Kapur stated that, with parties, "voters
would vote along party lines and pay less
attention to what candidates personally
stand for." I would say instead that, with
the existence of parties, voters are simply
more aware of candidates' principles, and
are able to vote lor what they stand foi
rather than voting for a familiar name.

PAC has offered the students a real
choice; they are looking to bring about
changes in the wav that student govern
ment operates within the University and
the importance of student voice here.
PAC candidates made it possible for stu
dents to make a well informed choice in
voting by identifying themselves as sup
porters of a unified platform, and 1 think
that this was a real asset to the election.
In my experience, student govern
ment elections often turn out to be more
of a popularity contest than a campaign
about real issues. It is unlikeh that the
average student w ill have a strong handle
on the issues each senate candidate per
sonal stands for, and therefore make
elese isions that are in no wav based on the
ideas or qualifications of those c andiates.
I urge the students ol Stanford to seri
ously consider the positive aspects of an
organization sik li as PA(! and not to sh\
away from voting for Setli and Malia
because of their connection to a party oi
platfoi m. Disbanding PAC, as kaput
suggested, would force students to vote
for people not parties, but it would .ilso
rob students of the opportunity to vote
for principles rather than people.
I, lor one, like the recent trend away
from a popularitv contest and towards
elections that represent real ideas, lake
this opportunity to become informed
about the issues that PAC. represents
before making a judgement about the
dangers of political parties at Stanford.

Dudas, who is oil to an investment bank

PAC far more interesting
than a political party
While I applaud Nick Kapur's efforts
to sound like George Washington in his
letter yesterday warning against the intro
duction of a party system to Stanford, 1
think lie's a little oil the mark. Besides
choosing to ignore the fact that the Plat
form for Accountability and Change fully
intends to dissolve after the new ASSU
session begins (which renders most of
Kapur's arguments moot), PAC repre
sents something tar more interesting than
a political party.
Rather than driving "... legislation by
getting people to vote along party lines,"
as Kapur claims PAC would do, PAC can
didates actually want to introduce mean
ingful and progressive legislation to a
representative body where none current
ly exists. PAC] candidates embody a a
vision, not a party ideology, of making
Stanford University a more democratic
institution, with active participation from
a wide range of campus communities.
If Kapur really wants to criticize ideo
logically-driven "parties," he should take
a look at the current ASSU, comprised
primarily of one majority "party," the
"Sadly Hiding In Their F.go Actualization
Through Excessive Resume Stuffing"
party (which, to give them credit, actually
makes a better acronym than PAC).
While Kapur sees an "ideal world"
where "candidates .. . run on their own
merits and [are] evaluated on their own
character and beliefs," 1 see (or saw, until
PAC arrived) an election campaign where
flashy posters and stupid slogans ("Win
ston tastes good — like a Senator
should!") decide who gets to represent
the student body — not character, beliefs
or principles.
PAC candidates, unlike the majority of
the people currently serving in the ASSU,

are a group of serious individuals com
mitted to promoting tangible, positive
change in the way that this University
operates. That's why 1 voted lor PAC c an
didates last week, and that's why I plan to

Support for PAC and concept of political
parties in general
Nick Kapur raised some very valid
points in his letter yesterday regarding
the action of political parties and the
effects that they might have on elections
at Stanford. I would like to point out the
positive aspects of such parties rather
then the trouble they cause.
Political parties serve an important
role in governments across the world.
They provide signals and dues to voters
about the position of the candidates in
those parties. They allow voters to make
rational choices in voting based on the the
candidates' parties.
I don't agree with Kapur's statement
that in an ideal world there would be no
parties. Without parties, people would
have a hard time making informed deci
sions. It may be true that party identifica
tion is an easy way out for people who do
not make the effort to become informed
about all issues and candidates, but in
reality the alternative is ignorance among
the majority of voters.
Regardless of whether you consider
PAC a party or a platform, it has given
students a way to support ideas they
agree with without knowing the candi
dates personally.
Some take issue with the fact that stu
dents voted the presidential slate and sen
ators running under PAC as a straight
ticket. Why not? Isn't this a more valid
way of choosing representatives than vot
ing for a few familiar names on a long bal
lot of people whose platforms seem unre
markable and unfamiliar?
Kapur stated that, with parties, "voters
would vote along party lines and pay less
attention to what candidates personally
stand for." I would say instead that, with
the existence of parties, voters are simply
more aware of candidates' principles, and
are able to vote lor what they stand foi
rather than voting for a familiar name.

PAC has offered the students a real
choice; they are looking to bring about
changes in the wav that student govern
ment operates within the University and
the importance of student voice here.
PAC candidates made it possible for stu
dents to make a well informed choice in
voting by identifying themselves as sup
porters of a unified platform, and 1 think
that this was a real asset to the election.
In my experience, student govern
ment elections often turn out to be more
of a popularity contest than a campaign
about real issues. It is unlikeh that the
average student w ill have a strong handle
on the issues each senate candidate per
sonal stands for, and therefore make
elese isions that are in no wav based on the
ideas or qualifications of those c andiates.
I urge the students ol Stanford to seri
ously consider the positive aspects of an
organization sik li as PA(! and not to sh\
away from voting for Setli and Malia
because of their connection to a party oi
platfoi m. Disbanding PAC, as kaput
suggested, would force students to vote
for people not parties, but it would .ilso
rob students of the opportunity to vote
for principles rather than people.
I, lor one, like the recent trend away
from a popularitv contest and towards
elections that represent real ideas, lake
this opportunity to become informed
about the issues that PAC. represents
before making a judgement about the
dangers of political parties at Stanford.

Help stop famine in Ethiopia
Once again we have begun to see the
all-too-familiar faces of hungry children
in the I lorn of Africa on our television
screens. As members of the Stanford
Kthiopian community, these images are
especially painful to us knowing that yet
again another disastrous famine is loom
ing over our country while the memory
of the horrifying pictures of 1984 is still
fiesh in our minds.
I he humanitarian disaster that is
unfolding in the region, unless quickly
prevented, is the largest famine in recent
inemorv. "In total, an estimated 15 mil
lion people are ai risk of food insecurit\
in the Horn of Africa in calendar year
2000," savs Prof. Falcon at the ('.enter for
Knvironmental Science and Policy at
Stanford L niversity.
Over half of this population (8.1 mil
lion) is in Kthiopia alone. I his is an
alarmingly large numbei of people at
risk iu contrast lo the wicleh publicized
1084 famine that killed approximately
one million people.
In the southeastern tow n of (.ode, it is
estimated that children under the- age of
live have been dying at the rate of a
do/en a day since February. It's been
four months since aid workers and the
Fthiopian government had first request
ed that towns like Code and Diliun be
given immediate assistance and thai a
million metric tonnes of food be dis
tributed to avert this famine.
Since then, I S. news sources like
I he Washington Post and (INN have
reported that between 8") and 90 per
cent of the livestock in ('.ode and sur
rounding towns have already perished.
Ihe Fthiopian government grain
reserves designed to avert famine disas
ters and once holding !}:">0,000 metric
tonnes of food have been diminished to
:">(),()()() metric tonnes.
In the midst of intense focus on other
international crises, attention has been
diverted too long from 11 iis catastrophe.
Relief is needed urgentl) in Fthiopia
and should not be ignored or the world
will once again be witnessing the repeat
of the 1984 famine, this time on a much
larger scale. (an rentlv, in Fthiopia near
ly eight million people are at risk of
dying from diseases, malnutrition and
starvation.
I he major cause of the c urrent food
shortage is three years of poor rains. It is
<i direct result ol cooler sea temperatures
in the Atlantic and Pacific ()ceans, which
have significantly reduced rainfalls in

Kast Africa.
For a region that heavilv depends on
farming for survival, the rains are critical
lor crop production. For the past three
years there has been severe shortage of
rain and this vear ii lias failed to come at
all.
W hat in.ikes this drought much more
devastating than the 1984 famine is the
fact that it is more widespread, covering
small isolated areas in 10 countries.
According to a recent Newsweek article,
one million people are affected in Soma
lia, which lias remained without a cen
tral government since the overthrow of
President Muhammad Siacl Bane in
1991.
Nearly a third of the Fritrean popula
tion is in danger of starvation, which has
been embroiled in blood\ boarder dis
pute after it invaded Fthiopian territory
in Ma\ of 1998. Millions more are at risk
in Sudan, Djibouti, Kenya, Burundi,
Rwanda, Uganda and 1 an/ania.
Fthiopian and I'.S. officials have been
forecasting the famine fot over a year,
but the international response have been
too little and too slow in this time of
urgent need. Currently, there are only
three emergence feeding centers set up
in the hardest hit ,;reas like Code and
Dihun.
According to BBC world service cor
respondents who have visited the area,
the feeding centers are equipped to treat
only the most severeh malnourished
children while thousands others wait in
turn to seek urgent help.
In the face of this pending humani
tarian disaster, we, the members of the
Stanford Fthiopian community, implore
the Stanford coiuinunitv to join our fight
against famine in Fast Africa.
We cannot sit idly bv until wrenching
images invade oui living rooms nightly
to react. In the words of a great human
itarian Martin Luther King, Jr. in a
speech given at Stanford in the late
19605. "I'lie time is alwavs tight to do
i iglit." Do right.

dents I nion at leabisaCcstanfbrd.edu if
vou would like to help.

"Janitors" column misses the point
I am writing in response lo I lie April 20
opinions column written bv Jennifer Wek
selbaum ( All I needed to know — I
learned in my (lining hall.")
Though I'm sure the Stern Cafeteria
taught her quite a leu lessons, perhaps
Wekselbaum should have paid more at
tention in Kcon I. Basic economic theory
serves to debunk some of the implicit un
derpinnings ol her arguments. 11 ere are
three inconvenient facts that have been ig
nored in the blaze of righteous indigna
tion:
First: I lie market does not pay well for
unskilled labor.
Second: Until automation can do the
job, there will always be a need for un
skilled labor.
Ihird: Inequality of outcome is at least
partly due to individual differences.
Let us examine the consequences tor
YVekselbauin's column. The first fact tells
us that the ease of replacing a worker is th
ree tl\ proportional to the time needed to
train a new one. While the politically tol -
led will bandy around terms like "sanita

tion engineer,' the truth is that janitorial
training likely consists of little more than
handing someone the mop and bucket.
II 8,500 janitors go on strike, there are
many unemployed people who are willing
and able to grab the opportunity. I his
means that wages are going to be low, as
the employer doesn't need to compete il
there are people hungry lor a job. ()n the
othei hand, Stanford students are a high
ly skilled group of people, and as the I di
versity wants to attract the best students
and keep thetn from going somewhere
else, part of the University's tactics involve
mandating high student wages.
1 he fundamental asymmetry lies in the
fact that janitors would not be able to do
the coursework of Stanford students,
while Stanford students would easily be
able to take on the job of a janitor.
Hie second fact tells us that there is al
ways going to be someone at the bottom of
the income pile, and that employing pres
sure tactics to make the janitors' contract
ing company increase their salaries is only
going to make the company less competi
tive in terms of price. It is not as if "highly
skilled" janitors will be attracted to those
companies with a higher wage.
I hat price increase gets passed on to
the student at least in part. I low main ol
the activists at the janitorial rally would be
willing to fork over $400 of theii personal

liiiids in appreciation <>1 the bathroom
(leaner? It's vers easy to put the blame on
the shadowy figures in the corridors of
power, bill the truth is that the student
population would not be willing i<> pas tin
extra mones lor something that gises
them little, il any, personal benefit.
I lie blow that the third fiict siukes,
however, is the most severe. No mallei
how much the activists will il to happen,
the lact that there are clillerences in peo
ple will not go asvas 1 . Not evei vone is smart
enough to go to Stanford, but sirtualls
everyone has the minimal level of intelli
gence required to be a janitoi
Note here that this does not mean that
till janitors are unintelligent, but ralliei
that intelligence is not .1 prerequisite lor
janitorial work. Intelligence is. however, a
prerequisite lor skilled work, and the mar
ket determined compensation lot skilled
work rises as the number of qualified indi
viduals lalls.
Thus, those who are more intelligent
would likely c hoose a job requiring more
skill due to the higher lescl of compensa
tion. The question of wliethei the intelli
gent have ibis choice in practice is dis
putable, but I feel that it is sale to sas that
there is not an agglomeration ol the bril
liant in the janitorial ranks. I 11 us the point
is thai the low wages of these workers are
in part due to the l;ic 1 that the) are not ca

pable ol doing more skilled laboi.
Finally, much is made ol the lac 1 thai

effects that they might have on elections
at Stanford. I would like to point out the
positive aspects of such parties rather
then the trouble they cause.
Political parties serve an important
role in governments across the world.
They provide signals and dues to voters
about the position of the candidates in
those parties. They allow voters to make
rational choices in voting based on the the
candidates' parties.
I don't agree with Kapur's statement
that in an ideal world there would be no
parties. Without parties, people would
have a hard time making informed deci
sions. It may be true that party identifica
tion is an easy way out for people who do
not make the effort to become informed
about all issues and candidates, but in
reality the alternative is ignorance among
the majority of voters.
Regardless of whether you consider
PAC a party or a platform, it has given
students a way to support ideas they
agree with without knowing the candi
dates personally.
Some take issue with the fact that stu
dents voted the presidential slate and sen
ators running under PAC as a straight
ticket. Why not? Isn't this a more valid
way of choosing representatives than vot
ing for a few familiar names on a long bal
lot of people whose platforms seem unre
markable and unfamiliar?
Kapur stated that, with parties, "voters
would vote along party lines and pay less
attention to what candidates personally
stand for." I would say instead that, with
the existence of parties, voters are simply
more aware of candidates' principles, and
are able to vote lor what they stand foi
rather than voting for a familiar name.

PAC has offered the students a real
choice; they are looking to bring about
changes in the wav that student govern
ment operates within the University and
the importance of student voice here.
PAC candidates made it possible for stu
dents to make a well informed choice in
voting by identifying themselves as sup
porters of a unified platform, and 1 think
that this was a real asset to the election.
In my experience, student govern
ment elections often turn out to be more
of a popularity contest than a campaign
about real issues. It is unlikeh that the
average student w ill have a strong handle
on the issues each senate candidate per
sonal stands for, and therefore make
elese isions that are in no wav based on the
ideas or qualifications of those c andiates.
I urge the students ol Stanford to seri
ously consider the positive aspects of an
organization sik li as PA(! and not to sh\
away from voting for Setli and Malia
because of their connection to a party oi
platfoi m. Disbanding PAC, as kaput
suggested, would force students to vote
for people not parties, but it would .ilso
rob students of the opportunity to vote
for principles rather than people.
I, lor one, like the recent trend away
from a popularitv contest and towards
elections that represent real ideas, lake
this opportunity to become informed
about the issues that PAC. represents
before making a judgement about the
dangers of political parties at Stanford.

Help stop famine in Ethiopia
Once again we have begun to see the
all-too-familiar faces of hungry children
in the I lorn of Africa on our television
screens. As members of the Stanford
Kthiopian community, these images are
especially painful to us knowing that yet
again another disastrous famine is loom
ing over our country while the memory
of the horrifying pictures of 1984 is still
fiesh in our minds.
I he humanitarian disaster that is
unfolding in the region, unless quickly
prevented, is the largest famine in recent
inemorv. "In total, an estimated 15 mil
lion people are ai risk of food insecurit\
in the Horn of Africa in calendar year
2000," savs Prof. Falcon at the ('.enter for
Knvironmental Science and Policy at
Stanford L niversity.
Over half of this population (8.1 mil
lion) is in Kthiopia alone. I his is an
alarmingly large numbei of people at
risk iu contrast lo the wicleh publicized
1084 famine that killed approximately
one million people.
In the southeastern tow n of (.ode, it is
estimated that children under the- age of
live have been dying at the rate of a
do/en a day since February. It's been
four months since aid workers and the
Fthiopian government had first request
ed that towns like Code and Diliun be
given immediate assistance and thai a
million metric tonnes of food be dis
tributed to avert this famine.
Since then, I S. news sources like
I he Washington Post and (INN have
reported that between 8") and 90 per
cent of the livestock in ('.ode and sur
rounding towns have already perished.
Ihe Fthiopian government grain
reserves designed to avert famine disas
ters and once holding !}:">0,000 metric
tonnes of food have been diminished to
:">(),()()() metric tonnes.
In the midst of intense focus on other
international crises, attention has been
diverted too long from 11 iis catastrophe.
Relief is needed urgentl) in Fthiopia
and should not be ignored or the world
will once again be witnessing the repeat
of the 1984 famine, this time on a much
larger scale. (an rentlv, in Fthiopia near
ly eight million people are at risk of
dying from diseases, malnutrition and
starvation.
I he major cause of the c urrent food
shortage is three years of poor rains. It is
<i direct result ol cooler sea temperatures
in the Atlantic and Pacific ()ceans, which
have significantly reduced rainfalls in

Kast Africa.
For a region that heavilv depends on
farming for survival, the rains are critical
lor crop production. For the past three
years there has been severe shortage of
rain and this vear ii lias failed to come at
all.
W hat in.ikes this drought much more
devastating than the 1984 famine is the
fact that it is more widespread, covering
small isolated areas in 10 countries.
According to a recent Newsweek article,
one million people are affected in Soma
lia, which lias remained without a cen
tral government since the overthrow of
President Muhammad Siacl Bane in
1991.
Nearly a third of the Fritrean popula
tion is in danger of starvation, which has
been embroiled in blood\ boarder dis
pute after it invaded Fthiopian territory
in Ma\ of 1998. Millions more are at risk
in Sudan, Djibouti, Kenya, Burundi,
Rwanda, Uganda and 1 an/ania.
Fthiopian and I'.S. officials have been
forecasting the famine fot over a year,
but the international response have been
too little and too slow in this time of
urgent need. Currently, there are only
three emergence feeding centers set up
in the hardest hit ,;reas like Code and
Dihun.
According to BBC world service cor
respondents who have visited the area,
the feeding centers are equipped to treat
only the most severeh malnourished
children while thousands others wait in
turn to seek urgent help.
In the face of this pending humani
tarian disaster, we, the members of the
Stanford Fthiopian community, implore
the Stanford coiuinunitv to join our fight
against famine in Fast Africa.
We cannot sit idly bv until wrenching
images invade oui living rooms nightly
to react. In the words of a great human

"Janitors" column misses the point
I am writing in response lo I lie April 20
opinions column written bv Jennifer Wek
selbaum ( All I needed to know — I
learned in my (lining hall.")
Though I'm sure the Stern Cafeteria
taught her quite a leu lessons, perhaps
Wekselbaum should have paid more at
tention in Kcon I. Basic economic theory
serves to debunk some of the implicit un
derpinnings ol her arguments. 11 ere are
three inconvenient facts that have been ig
nored in the blaze of righteous indigna
tion:
First: I lie market does not pay well for
unskilled labor.
Second: Until automation can do the
job, there will always be a need for un
skilled labor.
Ihird: Inequality of outcome is at least
partly due to individual differences.
Let us examine the consequences tor
YVekselbauin's column. The first fact tells
us that the ease of replacing a worker is th
ree tl\ proportional to the time needed to
train a new one. While the politically tol -
led will bandy around terms like "sanita

tion engineer,' the truth is that janitorial
training likely consists of little more than
handing someone the mop and bucket.
II 8,500 janitors go on strike, there are
many unemployed people who are willing
and able to grab the opportunity. I his
means that wages are going to be low, as
the employer doesn't need to compete il
there are people hungry lor a job. ()n the
othei hand, Stanford students are a high
ly skilled group of people, and as the I di
versity wants to attract the best students
and keep thetn from going somewhere
else, part of the University's tactics involve
mandating high student wages.
1 he fundamental asymmetry lies in the
fact that janitors would not be able to do
the coursework of Stanford students,
while Stanford students would easily be
able to take on the job of a janitor.
Hie second fact tells us that there is al
ways going to be someone at the bottom of
the income pile, and that employing pres
sure tactics to make the janitors' contract
ing company increase their salaries is only
going to make the company less competi
tive in terms of price. It is not as if "highly
skilled" janitors will be attracted to those
companies with a higher wage.
I hat price increase gets passed on to
the student at least in part. I low main ol
the activists at the janitorial rally would be
willing to fork over $400 of theii personal

liiiids in appreciation <>1 the bathroom
(leaner? It's vers easy to put the blame on
the shadowy figures in the corridors of
power, bill the truth is that the student
population would not be willing i<> pas tin
extra mones lor something that gises
them little, il any, personal benefit.
I lie blow that the third fiict siukes,
however, is the most severe. No mallei
how much the activists will il to happen,
the lact that there are clillerences in peo
ple will not go asvas 1 . Not evei vone is smart
enough to go to Stanford, but sirtualls
everyone has the minimal level of intelli
gence required to be a janitoi
Note here that this does not mean that
till janitors are unintelligent, but ralliei
that intelligence is not .1 prerequisite lor
janitorial work. Intelligence is. however, a
prerequisite lor skilled work, and the mar
ket determined compensation lot skilled
work rises as the number of qualified indi
viduals lalls.
Thus, those who are more intelligent
would likely c hoose a job requiring more
skill due to the higher lescl of compensa
tion. The question of wliethei the intelli
gent have ibis choice in practice is dis
putable, but I feel that it is sale to sas that
there is not an agglomeration ol the bril
liant in the janitorial ranks. I 11 us the point
is thai the low wages of these workers are
in part due to the l;ic 1 that the) are not ca

pable ol doing more skilled laboi.
Finally, much is made ol the lac 1 thai
these janitors iiiusi support a fainils on ,111
SS-an-hour wage. W'ekselbaiini cites the
laniils who has converted to segctarian
ism Ibr cost leasons. \\ bile the 11011 ible in

Former ASSU vice president supports
Newton / Villegas
In yesterday's Daily ("PAC and lhe
Daily need to inform students where Vil
legas is"), (iabriel I .a/arin alleged that the
Newton / Villegas campaign has been
pat t of a vast conspiracy with l he Daily to
hide the fact that Malia Villegas is in
Washington, D.C. l he conspiracy accu
sation would be laughable if it were not
pari of a larger smear and rumor cam
paign cun eiitl\ targeting Seth and Malia.
As with last week's supposed e-mail scan
dal, the supporters ol Liu and Dudas
have once again got the facts wrong and
managed to overloi >k the olfenses of their
own campaign.
In this case, it is dear that although
Malia will miss the first few weeks of her
term, she is committed to staying at Stan
lord fi)i the entire summer, a commit
ment not shared by opponent Mike
Dudas, who is oil to an investment bank
ing job on the Kast Coast. It is true that
Malia will miss Dead Week and finals, but
it is a much more serious issue that, il
elected, Dudas will be absent lor the criti
cal summer months.
As a former ASSU vice president, I
know that over the summer, an essential
foundation lor the year is created and
relationships with administrators are
formed. I.iu, Dudas and their supporters
want the Stanford student body to vote
lor them because Malia will miss three
weeks, but what about the three months
that Dudas himself will miss?
I urge students to vote in the runoff on
the issues and to ignore the misinforma
tion, allegations and lies that are being
circulated. I urge you to vote lor Seth

Newton and Malia Villegas.

Newly elected student council, senate
members support Newton / Villegas
As a majority of the recently-elected
ASSU Undergraduate Senate, and sever
al members of the ASSU Graduate Stu
dent Council, we overwhelmingly sup
port Seth Newton and Malia Villegas to
lead the ASSU next year.
As has been said time and again, from
their extensive experience, both within
the ASSU and outside the ASSU in vari
ous student organizations, Seth and Malia
have proven their commitment to the
Stanford student body. Their ability to
bring diverse groups of students together
has culminated in the Platform for
Accountability and Change (PAC), a truly
grassroots effort that boasts nearly 100
active student volunteers.
As ASSU president and vice president,
Seth and Malia will bring these diverse
groups of students into the ASSU, ensur
ing that as many Stanford students as
possible have a voice in the University's
decision-making process.
Throughout the campaign, Seth and
Malia have been honest about their past
accomplishments and their opponents,
and clear about their vision for the Stan
ford student body. On a personal level,
Seth and Malia are genuine people, driv
en by their values and not their resumes.
They have the proven ability to take a
stand on the issues facing Stanford stu

dents, while, at the same time, listening to
and respecting opposing views. I hey will
bring all of these qualities to their roles as
ASSU president and vice president.
We urge the Stanford student body to
join us in supporting Setli Newton and
Malia Villegas lor ASSU president and
vice president. On April 27 and 28, cast
your vote for something more — the Plat

PAC far more interesting
than a political party
While I applaud Nick Kapur's efforts
to sound like George Washington in his
letter yesterday warning against the intro
duction of a party system to Stanford, 1
think lie's a little oil the mark. Besides
choosing to ignore the fact that the Plat
form for Accountability and Change fully
intends to dissolve after the new ASSU
session begins (which renders most of
Kapur's arguments moot), PAC repre
sents something tar more interesting than
a political party.
Rather than driving "... legislation by
getting people to vote along party lines,"
as Kapur claims PAC would do, PAC can
didates actually want to introduce mean
ingful and progressive legislation to a
representative body where none current
ly exists. PAC] candidates embody a a
vision, not a party ideology, of making
Stanford University a more democratic
institution, with active participation from
a wide range of campus communities.
If Kapur really wants to criticize ideo
logically-driven "parties," he should take
a look at the current ASSU, comprised
primarily of one majority "party," the
"Sadly Hiding In Their F.go Actualization
Through Excessive Resume Stuffing"
party (which, to give them credit, actually
makes a better acronym than PAC).
While Kapur sees an "ideal world"
where "candidates .. . run on their own
merits and [are] evaluated on their own
character and beliefs," 1 see (or saw, until
PAC arrived) an election campaign where
flashy posters and stupid slogans ("Win
ston tastes good — like a Senator
should!") decide who gets to represent
the student body — not character, beliefs
or principles.
PAC candidates, unlike the majority of
the people currently serving in the ASSU,

are a group of serious individuals com
mitted to promoting tangible, positive
change in the way that this University
operates. That's why 1 voted lor PAC c an
didates last week, and that's why I plan to
vote for Newton and Villegas this week.
Call it whatever you want, PAC will
certainly make the ASSU a more interest
ing and potentially significant force on
campus. I'm all for that.

ree tl\ proportional to the time needed to
train a new one. While the politically tol -
led will bandy around terms like "sanita

tion engineer,' the truth is that janitorial
training likely consists of little more than
handing someone the mop and bucket.
II 8,500 janitors go on strike, there are
many unemployed people who are willing
and able to grab the opportunity. I his
means that wages are going to be low, as
the employer doesn't need to compete il
there are people hungry lor a job. ()n the
othei hand, Stanford students are a high
ly skilled group of people, and as the I di
versity wants to attract the best students
and keep thetn from going somewhere
else, part of the University's tactics involve
mandating high student wages.
1 he fundamental asymmetry lies in the
fact that janitors would not be able to do
the coursework of Stanford students,
while Stanford students would easily be
able to take on the job of a janitor.
Hie second fact tells us that there is al
ways going to be someone at the bottom of
the income pile, and that employing pres
sure tactics to make the janitors' contract
ing company increase their salaries is only
going to make the company less competi
tive in terms of price. It is not as if "highly
skilled" janitors will be attracted to those
companies with a higher wage.
I hat price increase gets passed on to
the student at least in part. I low main ol
the activists at the janitorial rally would be
willing to fork over $400 of theii personal

liiiids in appreciation <>1 the bathroom
(leaner? It's vers easy to put the blame on
the shadowy figures in the corridors of
power, bill the truth is that the student
population would not be willing i<> pas tin
extra mones lor something that gises
them little, il any, personal benefit.
I lie blow that the third fiict siukes,
however, is the most severe. No mallei
how much the activists will il to happen,
the lact that there are clillerences in peo
ple will not go asvas 1 . Not evei vone is smart
enough to go to Stanford, but sirtualls
everyone has the minimal level of intelli
gence required to be a janitoi
Note here that this does not mean that
till janitors are unintelligent, but ralliei
that intelligence is not .1 prerequisite lor
janitorial work. Intelligence is. however, a
prerequisite lor skilled work, and the mar
ket determined compensation lot skilled
work rises as the number of qualified indi
viduals lalls.
Thus, those who are more intelligent
would likely c hoose a job requiring more
skill due to the higher lescl of compensa
tion. The question of wliethei the intelli
gent have ibis choice in practice is dis
putable, but I feel that it is sale to sas that
there is not an agglomeration ol the bril
liant in the janitorial ranks. I 11 us the point
is thai the low wages of these workers are
in part due to the l;ic 1 that the) are not ca

pable ol doing more skilled laboi.
Finally, much is made ol the lac 1 thai
