Former ASSU vice president supports
Newton / Villegas
In yesterday's Daily ("PAC and lhe
Daily need to inform students where Vil
legas is"), (iabriel I .a/arin alleged that the
Newton / Villegas campaign has been
pat t of a vast conspiracy with l he Daily to
hide the fact that Malia Villegas is in
Washington, D.C. l he conspiracy accu
sation would be laughable if it were not
pari of a larger smear and rumor cam
paign cun eiitl\ targeting Seth and Malia.
As with last week's supposed e-mail scan
dal, the supporters ol Liu and Dudas
have once again got the facts wrong and
managed to overloi >k the olfenses of their
own campaign.
In this case, it is dear that although
Malia will miss the first few weeks of her
term, she is committed to staying at Stan
lord fi)i the entire summer, a commit
ment not shared by opponent Mike
Dudas, who is oil to an investment bank
ing job on the Kast Coast. It is true that
Malia will miss Dead Week and finals, but
it is a much more serious issue that, il
elected, Dudas will be absent lor the criti
cal summer months.
As a former ASSU vice president, I
know that over the summer, an essential
foundation lor the year is created and
relationships with administrators are
formed. I.iu, Dudas and their supporters
want the Stanford student body to vote
lor them because Malia will miss three
weeks, but what about the three months
that Dudas himself will miss?
I urge students to vote in the runoff on
the issues and to ignore the misinforma
tion, allegations and lies that are being
circulated. I urge you to vote lor Seth

Newton and Malia Villegas.

Newly elected student council, senate
members support Newton / Villegas
As a majority of the recently-elected
ASSU Undergraduate Senate, and sever
al members of the ASSU Graduate Stu
dent Council, we overwhelmingly sup
port Seth Newton and Malia Villegas to
lead the ASSU next year.
As has been said time and again, from
their extensive experience, both within
the ASSU and outside the ASSU in vari
ous student organizations, Seth and Malia
have proven their commitment to the
Stanford student body. Their ability to
bring diverse groups of students together
has culminated in the Platform for
Accountability and Change (PAC), a truly
grassroots effort that boasts nearly 100
active student volunteers.
As ASSU president and vice president,
Seth and Malia will bring these diverse
groups of students into the ASSU, ensur
ing that as many Stanford students as
possible have a voice in the University's
decision-making process.
Throughout the campaign, Seth and
Malia have been honest about their past
accomplishments and their opponents,
and clear about their vision for the Stan
ford student body. On a personal level,
Seth and Malia are genuine people, driv
en by their values and not their resumes.
They have the proven ability to take a
stand on the issues facing Stanford stu

dents, while, at the same time, listening to
and respecting opposing views. I hey will
bring all of these qualities to their roles as
ASSU president and vice president.
We urge the Stanford student body to
join us in supporting Setli Newton and
Malia Villegas lor ASSU president and
vice president. On April 27 and 28, cast
your vote for something more — the Plat
form for Accountability and Change.
