# Stanford Theater: A rare gem in gaudy Palo Alto
## 
### ANDREW HINDERAKER GUEST COLUMNIST 
Palo Alto's a fabulous college town,
especially if you're looking to furnish
your dorm room with a $2,000 dollar
lamp. 1 he main drag on University
Avenue is lined with shops that sell every
thing a Stanford student could possibly
desire — from Oriental rugs to designer
kitchen products, Palo Alto has it all. And,
if you re sick of Wilbur food, just swing by
Lytton Avenue for a nice cheap meal at
Spago's.
Let's face it — Palo Alto is not our
town. We have developed our "bubble"
here at Stanford partially because we
have no surrounding community with
which to associate. There are no college
bars in Palo Alto, the Stanford Bookstore
branch on University doesn't even sell fic
tion. 1 lie overpriced shops, galleries, and
restaurants that line the streets of Palo
Alto target the highly-paid citizens of the
town.
And that's fine. My point is not to com

plain that we, as Stanford students, are
not welcomed into the arms of Palo Alto
yuppies. In fact, I'm only writing this arti
cle to remind students that there are, in
fact, a few small gems hidden in the
gaudy opulence of Palo Alto.
The Stanford Theater is one such trea
sure. I'm a junior at Stanford and, for
three years, 1 have walked along Univer
sity Avenue, passed underneath the the
ater's marquee on my way to Pluto's or
CPK and not stopped once to take in a
film at the historic venue. Finally, last
week, I decided to take advantage of
Stanford Theater's Hitchcock Film Festi
val and bought my ticket for an evening
showing of "Psycho." It turned out to be
my best cinematic experience in years.
Notice I did not write that it was the
best film I had seen in years. Don't get me
wrong — "Psycho" was excellent with
phenomenal performances from Antho
ny Perkins and Janet Leigh. But it was the
combination of film and venue that made
the evening so memorable.
Just the entrance into the theater is a

treat. As I walked into the beautiful and
open two-story theater (amazingly well
preserved), I was immediately met with
the sounds of an organ. The Stanford
Theater apparently precedes each show
ing with the playing of the movie's score.
Before the film even began, I was
immersed in a uniquely "Hitchcockian"
atmosphere. The small stage upon which
the organ and organist were situated then
descended as the curtains opened and the
film began. No previews, no dancing pop
corn, no nonsense advertisements to
detract from the cinematic tone that had
been struck.
When the film finished, the curtains
quickh closed and the organist immedi
ately rose to finish the score. For the first
time in years, I stayed in the theater after
the film had finished.
('•rowing up in Wisconsin, we had two
theaters in mv hometown. I he\ each had
three screens. 'They were run-down, the
seats were narrow and broken, there was
maybe two feet of space between the front
row and the screen. ('This didn't discour

age my friends and I from sitting in the
front row for every show, mind you.) But
those theaters had diameter. Granted, I
don't know exactly what that word
means, but there was something familiar
and even wonderful about the sticky
floors and stale popcoi n.
All we seem to have now are 20-screen
multiplexes. They're like frightening little
villages, with complete restaurants and
coffee shops located inside. The grungy
three-game arcade room that 1 grew up
with has been replaced by a Starbucks.
Last night, I went to the AMU Merca
do to see "Keeping the Faith." Naturally,
it was sold out, along with every other
movie with decent prospects. It seemed
m\ friends and I were stuck with "Rules
of Kngagement," a cliched military
expose. (You've probably seen the movie
already — perhaps under its original title,
"A Few Uood Men.") The film was hor
rendous, but not so appalling as the
prices of theater goods themselves.
An adult ticket ran for nine dollars
(although, to their credit, the Mercado

docs oiler student rates). Popcorn and a
soda cost seven.
My entire evening at the Stanford
Theater ran for $10. And I can't overem
phasize the true value of the theater: you
get to see great movies. The theater is fol
lowing its I litchcock run with a 3-D Festi
val, beginning with another Hitchcock
classic, "Dial M for Murder."
I he showing of "Psycho" I attended
was perhaps half full. Mv friends and I
were the only students in the entire
crowd. That's not surprising — we have a
tendency to be drawn to the likes of
Cruise and Kidman, not Kogart and
Bacall. But I encourage all students to
visit the Stanford Theater.
Perhaps, like me, you'll be reminded
simply of how much fun movies can be.
Perhaps you'll see that, sometimes, it's
worth breaking out of our little bubble, if
only to discover a hidden gem in a gaudy
town.
