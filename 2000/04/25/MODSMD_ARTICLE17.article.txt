# Courts wrong on Elian: boy must be with his father
## 
### ALLEN DREXEL GUEST COLUMNIST 
The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals
decision last Wednesday preventing Elian
Gonzalez from returning to his homeland
pending the outcome of further U.S.
court proceedings did not surprise many
legal observers.

DAILY OP-ED

In issuing a preliminary injunction,
the Atlanta court merely preserved the
status quo in a decidedly complicated case
until judges have had an opportunity to
consider fully the underlying question
before it, namely whether Elian Gonzalez
should be allowed to apply for asylum in
this country.
What was surprising, and also deeply
disturbing, was the court's determination
that Immigration and Naturalization Ser
vice officials had erred in refusing to
review the six-year-old's asylum applica
tion. (The INS had earlier concluded that

only Juan Miguel Gonzalez, the boy's
father, could properly file a request on his
behalf.)
fhe court's opinion faulted the INS for
failing to interview Elian about his wishes.
The opinion also concluded that the gov
ernment, before reaching its decision,
should have factored in. not only the
father's wishes, but also "the child's sepa
rate and independent interests in seeking
asylum."
In other words, the court seemed to
suggest, the INS should have seriously
considered a six-year-old's supposed
desire to stay with his Miami relatives iu
deciding whether or not to consider the
boy's asylum application (though actualb
the application in question, as it was filed
by the boy's relatives, wasn't Elian's in am
meaningful sense).
Elian's wish to stav in the I nited States,
according to the court, should have been
weighed alongside, or possibly instead of
(!), the desire ol Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
Elian's undisputed legal and biological
father, to return with his child to Cuba.

From the perspective of parents and
children's advocates, the Circuit Court's
decision was deeph troubling in a num
ber of respects. One of these is the prece
dent it establishes for allowing — indeed,
encouraging — voting children to effec
tively testify against their undisputed par
ents in cases that don't invoke allegations
of parental abuse or neglect.
But it is on a more personal level, from
the perspective of someone who lived
through bis own custody trial as a nine
year-old growing up in San Antonio, that
I find myself most chilled l>\ the court's
action. In l l .)78, I was compelled to testify
in court on behalf of one of mv parents —
and thus, effectively, against my other
patent, whom I also loved very deeply.
Mv testimony, which came in response
to a series ol questions ending with the
clincher, "And w here do you want to live
now, Allen?," was, quite simply, the lowest
point of mv life. Ihe court appearance
and its outcome led m\ voting self to feel
as though I had destroved my mom and
abandoned her.

Within a few days, having packed up
all mv things, Mom, brave and tearless at
least part of the way, drove tne across
town for the custody transfer. "Goodbye,
Mom. I love you. Ill see you at visitation."
Children don't get over that kind of
pain and guilt very easily, or very quickly,
if ever. Believe me.
But consider Elian's far more
appalling circumstance. His mother,
without informing Juan Miguel Gonzalez
or giving the boy a chance to sav goodbye
to the father with whom he lived, secret
ed the little child away, bound for an ill
fated passage to the United States.
Sometime that night, as we all bv now
know, the boat carrying Elian, his mom
and nine other passengers capsized. As
Gabriel Garcia Marquez wrote in The
New York limes last month, the boy's
mother, before drowning, apparently
had the presence of mind to give the bov
a bottle of fresh water. "Goodbye, Mom."
Common sense, and substantial social
science research, suggest that six-year-old
children are incompetent to determine

which adults are best suited to raise them.
They are similarly unqualified to decide
which country they want to live in, what
kind of political-economic system they
prefer, and so on. Such questions tend to
be reduced in children's minds to queries
like: which relatives will give me more
toys and who will take me to Disney
World more often?
Not only are young children like Klian
singularly ill-equipped to make rational
decisions about such weighty matters,
but, if my own experience is any guide,
they carry an often intolerable burden of
guilt, shame and tear once they've been
forced to make such decisions.
I he fear and guilt experienced by little
Elian can only have been exacerbated by
his relatives' decision to broadcast a home
video of the child defying his father, with
whom he was recently reunited.
Return Elian to his father. Don't con
sult him. Just do it.
