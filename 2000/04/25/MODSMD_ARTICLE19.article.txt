## tee off vs. Mustangs

I'ennant rate, anvone?
With a 31-10 record and at 11-4
within the Pacific 10 Conference, the
No. 1 Stanford baseball team appears
to be on the right track, heading back
towards its fourth-consecutive confer
ence title.
I lie Card is deadlocked with Ari
zona State atop the conference stand
ings with nine games left to play in the
Pac-10 season, meaning a bad week
end could effectively give the title to the
Sun Devils or even allow I'CLA to
sneak in and grab first place. I he mar
gin lor error, it would seem, is ra/or
slim.
But before welcoming the Califor
nia Golden Bears to the Farm this
weekend, the Cardinal must first take
on California Polytechnic State Uni
versity-San Luis Obispo, lhankfulh
known .is Cal Poly (20-20). I he non
confercnce game against the Mustangs
will begin tonight at (i p.m. at Sunken
1 )iamond.

While these games have no impact
on the Pac-10 title race, non-confer
ence games can go a long way in deter
mining who gets to host a regional
round in the NCAA tournament.
While hosting such a round seems as
sured ft>i the Cardinal at this point
given their high ranking and tradition,
losing a lew of these mid-week contests
can knock the wind out of even the
most confident teams' sails.
Confidence is one thing certainly
not lacking from Stanford, not after a
weekend series with USC that saw the
Cardinal take two of three from the
I rojans while piling up an ama/ing 1 8
runs in a single game.
"We hadn't been hitting the ball
very well this series, but we sure broke
out of it today," said Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess following the
final game Saturday, an IK-4 victor)
over the Trojans. "It was one of those
davs when the conditions were tight
for hitting. I his wasa big series lor us."
I he leaders behind the offensive ex
plosion were two ol the usual suspects
for the Card, senior center fielder Kcl

nuiiul Mntll and junior right fielder
Joe Bon hard. Ninth was (i-for-lf) in
the series, busting out in the* final game
with a 4-for-(i da\ which included a
double, a homer and three runs hatted
in.
