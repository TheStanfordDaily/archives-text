# Commission reviewing election improprieties
## Election rules examined as both slates await verdicts on campaign violation charges; Levins role questioned 
### MEGAN KNIZE STAFF WRITER 
It had all the elements of a good drama — except
the happy ending. Last night, the ASS I' Flections
Hearings Commission interrupted the examination
of charges against the presidential slate of Seth New
ton and Malia Villegas to question whether the rules
governing the election are valid.
The unfinished hearing included allegations that
current ASSU President Mike Levin improperly pres
sured ASSU senate candidates to support Newton.
The hearing for juniors Ben Liu and Mike Dudas,
the opposing slate, took place before the Newton and
Villegas hearing, and proceeded without interrup
tion. The commission is scheduled to render a verdict
on both slates by midnight tonight.
During the meeting, Newton's supporters ques
tioned whether the (Campaign Practice's (lode — the
rules that regulate elections practices — apply to the
presidential election. The code is being called into
question because it was not approved by the Gradu
ate Student Counc il.
"Halfway through the hearing 1 was alerted to
what appears to be an oversight made bv last year's
senate and Graduate Student Council,'' said Hear
ings Officer Katie Young, a junior.
T he most serious of the c harges brought against
Newton-Villegas by the commission was whether or
not Newton had any knowledge that current ASSI
President Mike Levin allegedly made phone calls last
weekend to elected and non-elected senators asking
them to join the campaign of New ton's Platform for
Accountability and Change.
According to Young, Levin allegedly told prospec
tive ASSU members that "Seth and Malia w ill win the
run-off," and that if they wanted to work in the ASSU
next year, they would have to join Platform for Ac -
countability and Change, the political group formed
by Newton and Villegas.
Young said that Levin also ended the conversation
by telling people, "We never had this conversation."
Young said that Levin called freshman politicians
and "blackmailed them into joining PAC" if the\
wanted a spot on the ASSU the following year.
" 'We never had that conversation' was not in the
context of blackmail," Levin said. "1 meant that the
conversation needs to remain confidential."
Newton stressed that Levin will have little say over
the workings of next year's senate.

"I don't think
Mike Levin will
have that kind of
influence," New
ton said.

But Young responded by saying, "Many freshmen
feel that the current ASSI' president will have control
over their career and I hat's very intimidating."
Senior Steven Aronowit/., chair of the I ndergrad
uate Senate, added, "It doesn't matter what the Pres
ident thinks, he's being completely unrealistic about
w hat c an happen; all t he chairs are decided internal
ly within the senate."
Young said that Levin called her and alleged that
1 .iu and Dudas were running an unethical campaign.
Young added, "I have no personal feelings toward
or about any of the candidates or slates involved. It
brings no pleasure to bring allegations against any
one. It's just ni)' job, I don't even plan to vote in the
runoff."
Aronowit/ said he was "really surprised" to hear
about the allegations against 1 .evin, and added that lie
had never spoken to Levin about convincing candi
dates to endorse PAC 1.
"That was something he decided to do on his
own," Aronowit/ said.
New ton said that Levin's role was as an occasional
consultant.
"I le would offer advice when 1 would have inter
actions with him and important issues students care
about, teaching me about the ins and outs of the
ASSI!," Newton said.
Levin arrived at the hearing at 1 1:40 p.m. last night
to the commission and a handful of PAC '.sup
porters, "11 was never my intent to blackmail anyone."
lie said he called close personal friends, and he
told them what he was doing.
"At no time did Seth have information of these
phone calls," 1 .evin added.
Levin noted that many people would wonder why
he was endorsing PAC, but that he had come to this
dec ision himself. He said he felt Newton's principles
and his platform were better for students.
"The last thing 1 want to do is undermine the in
tegrity of nn office," Levin said. "1 did nothing
wrong."
Young said she can't bring any charges against
Levin because he is not running for office this year.
I lie commission also heard arguments during the
hearing of Liu and Dudas of whet her or not an e-mail
and posting to the ASSU newsgroup violated the
C lampaign Practices (lode.
Undergraduate Senator loin Liu, Ben fan's
brother, sent an e-mail in response to an April I.S
Daily article in which he called a meeting at the
