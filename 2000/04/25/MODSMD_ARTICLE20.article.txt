### BEN ALLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
I lie Stanford track and field teams got their first
peek at the site of June's Olympic Trials at the Spring
Festival and Bruce Drummond Invitational at Sacra
mento State University this weekend. And though the
competition and conditions did not lend themselves to
Olympic caliber marks, the Cardinal gathered a few
solid performances and a number of intangible bene
fits from the meet.
On the tangible side, the off-track performers gave
another round of solid efforts despite frustrating
weather.
lot the men, senior 1 bby Stevenson cleared 18 feet,
1 iiu h to win the pole vault, and junior Chad Wassink
took the javelin title at 208-4.
Freshman Omai I nan continued his string of
strong discus tin < >ws. hurling the plate out to 178-0.
For I he women, senior Cassie Roniuld took second
in the shot put at 44-9, and freshman Kathleen
Donoghue cleared 12-5 1/2 in the pole vault for third.
Performances by the distance squads were only
slighih less tangible, as the timing system went out for
thc rat es over 400 meters, and times are still yet to be
oflit iall\ sorted out.
Junior Michael Stember, the
crowd favorite out ol |esuit High,
may have had the most impressive
distance mark of the day in (he 800
meters, winning in I minute, 48
seconds.

Set 1 i I lejny stored the win in the
1,500 meters at 3:49, and sopho

3:. r >o.
For the women, sophomore
1 .aura I 'inner cruised to a new per
sonal best ol 9:44 in the 3,000 me
ters.
Though their times might sug
gest otherwise, perhaps the
strongest performances of the day
came from the Stanford splint
corps. Running into a swirling
headwind that topped out near five
meters per second, the squad had
to perform phenomenally just to
gather respectable marks.
Junior Wilsa Charles led the
charge for the women with a lirst
place showing in the 200-nietei
dash (2L53). Junioi Danielle Spur
lock was third in the 400-meter
hurdles ;it 01.89, and sophomore
Robyn Wooltblk bolted to a 14.22
in the 100 hurdles.
For the men, junior Leroy Sims
clocked a 21.90 in the 200.
"We had «i lot of good marks in the
sprints and jumps, considering that
conditions were not ideal," said
head coach \ in I..manna.
1 k spite the conditions, the meet
gave Stanford the opportunity to
scope the site of |line's Trials — a
meet with big implications for Stan
ford track and field.
"As a coach who's going to have
a lot of athletes at the ()lympic I ri
als, it's alwavs to watch a competi
tion on-site — find out about the fa
cilities, where the wind is coining
frcmi — all of the things that could
be factors," 1 .ananna said.
