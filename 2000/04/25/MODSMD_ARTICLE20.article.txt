I lie Stanford track and field teams got their first
peek at the site of June's Olympic Trials at the Spring
Festival and Bruce Drummond Invitational at Sacra
mento State University this weekend. And though the
competition and conditions did not lend themselves to
Olympic caliber marks, the Cardinal gathered a few
solid performances and a number of intangible bene
fits from the meet.
On the tangible side, the off-track performers gave
another round of solid efforts despite frustrating
weather.
lot the men, senior 1 bby Stevenson cleared 18 feet,
1 iiu h to win the pole vault, and junior Chad Wassink
took the javelin title at 208-4.
Freshman Omai I nan continued his string of
strong discus tin < >ws. hurling the plate out to 178-0.
For I he women, senior Cassie Roniuld took second
in the shot put at 44-9, and freshman Kathleen
Donoghue cleared 12-5 1/2 in the pole vault for third.
Performances by the distance squads were only
slighih less tangible, as the timing system went out for
thc rat es over 400 meters, and times are still yet to be
oflit iall\ sorted out.
