## Tellme seeks to bring the power of the Internet to your phone line START-UP spotlight 
### CHRISTOPHER LYLE RAVI SARIN 
"Restaurants. Italian. It'll me more.
Connect nie."
After speaking these lew words, you
could be making reservations at an Ital
ian restaurant right around the corner.
Sound impressive? We thought so, too.
Tellme lets you dial an 800-number
and navigate an automated telephone
service using your voice. The services
currently ottered include movie times

and reviews, restaurant information,
stock, quotes, sports, news, weather, traf
fic, airline information and free tele
phone calls. When you are connected to
the system, you can access any of their
free services just In saying one of the
many keywords.
"The goal of 1 ell me is to make life sim
pler. We want to help everyday people
accomplish everyday sorts of tasks," said
Angus Davis, co-founder of Tellme.
The uses for Tellme apply to many cir
cumstances. Rather than wading
through radio stations hoping to catch a
traffic update, call l'ellme to get the in
formation on demand, frying to find the
latest stock quote and news for your com

pany of choice? ( all I ellmt* and name
your company. Looking lor a place to
eat? lellme lets you search lor restau
rants In category and location. ()nce you
have decided on a restaurant, just say,
"donned me. and lellme will connect
you with the restaurant and you can
make a reservation.
1 lie kind of inhumation vou can find
at lellme is the same inlbrmation you
can find fairly easih on the Internet.
However, what makes lellme revolu
tionary is th.ii vou don't need a comput
er to <|iii( kl\ get this inlorination. It's eas
ier to pi< k up ,i phone and make a free
(.ill 11 i.i11 to mi non yom computer, con
ned to the Internet and then browse
through countless Web pages lor the in
formation.
In ordei to accomplish its goals,
I ell me will prohahh experience gr< )wing
pains, according to Davis. Developing
the hardware and software to support
millions ol phone tails and io translate
human voices into data that can be rec
ognized In the system is a massive un
dertaking.
"Phones just work." Davis said. "Peo
ple who use coin pi iters a lot are used to
crashes. Part of out audience doesn't
have that experience, so one ol our big
challenges is making a s\steni reliable,
Iriendh, simple and personal enough
ill.u all audiences will find l ellme enjov
able."
I el line is al reach expel iencing some
ol the problems that can be expected as
tliev expand. At some points in the ser
vice, you have Lo be patient while
lellme processes what you have said.
I lie speech recognition system is verv
good, Inn sometimes ii cannot recog
nize ever) word vou s,i\. Also, ii might
be hard to use it in voui dorm room, be
cause ba< kground noise c an disturb the
s\ stem.
One ina\ wondei how lellme can
make inonev when offeringsin Ii services
eniirel) lice, liist, lellme has made
partnerships with content providers to
bring in revenue. Also, il vou are making

vertisement is played before thecal! goes
through. Such advertising represents an
other revenue stream.
I ellme, the company, is only just a lit
tle more than a year old. I he idea began
at Netscape where the two co-founders,
Davis and Mike McCue, worked until
they left to pursue Tellme full-time at the
beginning ol 1999.
At Netscape, McCue was the vice pres
ident of technology, and Davis was the
product manager for Netscape Commu
nicator. 1 he two first met in 1996 at a
Netsc ape Developer's Conference where
\lc( '.ue convinced Davis to work full-time
lor Netscape. His decision meant that he
would not go to college, a decision that
McCue made earlier when he went to
work for IBM out ol high school. I heir
lirst conversation actually involved the
possibility ol browsing the Internet over
the phone.
"by December ol 199H, l ellme was
taking over my life," Davis said. "I would
be driving to work and thinking about
l ellme. I would be at my desk thinking
about Tellnie. Meetings, lellme. I was
thinking about it all the time and every
where."
Since then, l ellme has grown to over
100 employees and outgrown their office
space twice already. The idea has been
very well-received iu the technology and
venture capital worlds. l ellme has even
brought together formerly competing
employees and investors.
l or example, the management team
consists of the two co-founders from
Netscape, and one of their direct com
petitors, I ladi Partovi, the former group
program managei for Microsoft's Inter
net Explorer. Also, Kleiner Perkins Cau
field and Hvers and Benchmark Capital,
two of the Vallev's most prominent ven
ture capital firms, combined efforts in
funding Lellme.
However, their greatest collaborative
task \et may be l ellme s primary goal.
"We want to merge the power of the
Internet with the convenience of the
phone," I )a\ is said.
