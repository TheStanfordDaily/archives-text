have noticed that when you turn the glass,
the ice doesn't move with it; the water lags
behind due to inertia.
I lie same tiling happens in the inner
ear when the head turns, except that the
fluid lagging behind presses up against a
flexible membrane that is stretched across
the tube. That pressure is turned into a
neural signal that tells the VOR how fast
the head is turning. This neural signal is

I he human brain contains perhaps
100 trillion connections between neurons,
roughly 1,000 times more connections
than there are stars in the Milkv Way

tangle this huge biological circuit?
When faced with such a daunting task,
the typical scientific approach is to start
with something simple. Neurobiology
Prof. Jennifer Raymond, a recent addi
tion to the Medical School faculty, believes
that the kev to understanding how the
mind produces our complex behaviors
and stores our memories may be hiding in
the relatively simple neural circuits that
control our unconscious reflex move
ments.
As a result of years of study, there is a
wealth of knowledge about the properties
of individual neurons. Neurons can
process and retrieve information, and
they can change their properties and con
nections, a phenomena known as plastici
ty-
Ihe challenge now is to try and under
stand how these properties of individual
neurons contribute when groups of neu
rons are connected to form a c ircuit.
"Most every neuroscientist would
agree that synaptic plasticity contributes
in some way to learning," said Raymond.
"We know a lot about the details of cellu
lar processes that allow a neuron to
change, and people are now getting very
interested in putting that... back into the
context of a real live circuit" and seeing
how the parts function as whole.
The circuit that Raymond studies con
trols the vestibulo-oc ular reflex, or VOR.
We all experience the VOR every day,
every time we turn our head. It is the re
flex that stabilizes our vision as the head
moves. Without it, our visual experience
would bounce and swivel along with our
head, just like the scene in a cheap home
video.
The VOR works by detecting head
movements and responding almost in
stantly with a compensatory eye move
ment. The circuit starts in the inner ear
with a system of fluid-filled tubes that con

bounced through a routing center called
the vestibular nucleus to a set of motor
neurons, which control the muscles that
move the eyes.
What makes this circuit particularly in
teresting is that, in a simple way, it learns.
The VOR is constantly being fine-tuned
because the eye movements necessary to
keep vision stable can change. I his hap
pens, tor instance, when someone puts on
a pair of glasses. Through the lenses, the
relationship between head movmentsand
how much the visual world moves is sud
denly different. One reason that it takes
time to get used to a new pair of glasses is
that the VOR needs time to adapt to these
new conditions.
The V( )R learns by using another layer
of controlling circuitry: in addition to the
simple circuit from the inner ear to the eye
muscles, there is an alternate route lor the
neural signal, through a part of the brain
called the cerebellum. The cerebellum is
involved in line tuning muscle coordina
tion throughout the body, and this in
cludes the eye movements in the VOR.
When the visual system complains that the
images it is receiving are not stable, the
cerebellum directs the needed c hanges in

the VC)R circuit.
One of the things Raymond would like
to know is what changes are made in the
circuitry when the VOR learns. The best
way to figure this out is to trie k the Y( )R in
an experimental setting. In one such ex
periment, a subject is surrounded by an
image that shilts in the opposite direction
from the way the head is turning. The
normal reflex will not move the eyes
enough to track the image, so the VOR

scious reflex movements.

ment to compensate. The key is to record
neural activity at various places in the
VOR circuit as it adjusts to this new envi
ronment.
"In a simple behavior like this, where
we really have a good understanding of at
least most of the circuit," said Raymond,
"we can in theory go systematically from
one part of the circuit to the next" to see
where changes are made.
Such a systematic approach has re
vealed where in the VOR circuit changes
are made to produce adjustments in the
reflex. When more eye movement is re
quired to track an image, for instance, the
neurons in the vestibular nucleus that
relay this signal to the eye muscles tire
more rapidly.
There are some unexpected twists in
the data. It seems that there are actuallv a
number of different places in the circuit
where changes can occur. This is a bit puz
zling because it is not the simplest way, in
theory, to accomplish things.
"Ifyou just need to make the rellex get
bigger or smaller, then, win would you
have changes at more than one site?" said
Raymond.
One possibility, she sa\s, is
that having many such le verage
points where alterations occur
might make the circuit more
adaptable. I he lesson, in gener
al, is that even simple c ircuitry
like the VOR can throw re
searchers a lew (in \cs.
A still more profound ellort
involves trying to understand
how changes in neural c ire uitr\
are orchestrated during learn
ing. How do the neurons know
what to change, and where?
Clearly, other neurons 'tell'
them, but these neurons are talk
ing to one another all oft lie time.
Scientists would like to know
which parts of that chatter are in
structions to change the wa\
things are done and what the
code is that these instruct ions are
written in.

It might not seem that such a
