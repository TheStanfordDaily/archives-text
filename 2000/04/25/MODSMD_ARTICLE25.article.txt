# Setting the record straight: the history of Cisco
## Focal Point 
### 
Computing, networking and
world-wide-web applica
tions are now commodities
that affect almost all aspects of our
lives. Twenty to 30 years have
passed since the invention ol
many of the underlying tec hnolo
gies leading up to this information
revolution.
We are beginning to try to gain
some historical perspective on the
people and the settings that gave
rise to these ideas, along with the
extraordinarily successful indus
tries that pace the marketplace for
derived commercial products.
Source materials for these histories
are often shaded by company mar
keters trying to extol a company's
virtues during startup, garnering
investment capital and moving to
ward public stock offerings.
Erequently, public attention is
focused only on the people who
became rich and famous as a result
of a startup (e.g., Marc Audi eesen
of Netscape or Len Bosack and

Sanely I.erner of Cisco Systems)
rather than the true inventors.
In the history of networking,
Boh Kahn, Vint Cert and Boh
Metcalfe have properly gotten
credit for the invention and de
velopment of the early
ARPANET (late 1900s), the Eth
ernet (mid-19705) and the earl\
Internet (1980s). I here is anoth
er part of this story though that
remains muddled in the public
view — the invention ol commer
cial Internet router technologies
(1980s) that make possible the in -
credible network of networks
comprising the modern Internet
and which fueled the meteoric
success of (lisco Systems.
I he origin of Internet routers
and Cisco Systems is a uniquely
Stanford story and reflects the
power of Stanford as an incubator
for new technologies. Thus, it is
important to get the record
straight about what really hap
pened so the Stanford community
can learn from this process.
Computer networking at Stan
ford has a long and productive
history. I he Stanford AI Labora
tory was among the first of the 64

nodes on the ARPANET in the
late 19605. The SUM EX-AIM
project in the Medical School was
added in 1974 and became the
first non-DoD node on the
ARPANET.
Many experiments were done
in (he tnid-to-late 1970s to inter
connect larger numbers of ma
chines, but these efforts changed
fundamentally in early 1980,

ed Stanford (along with MI I and
Carnegie Mellon University) ac
cess to their Ethernet technology.
I he Ethernet design (by Metcalfe
and Boggs) was an extraordinari
ly elegant solution to intercon

necting machines and was adopt
ed eagerly.
Phis led innnediatek to the
need lor "router technology" to
interconnect not onlv machines
on a given network segment, but
to interconnect network segments

with each other and the growing
national Internet. The SI'MEX
project initiated an effort to build
a network router and Bill Yeager
began to work on it.
Yeager produced a stable
PDI'l 1-based router by late 1981
and then a Motorola 08000-based
router by late 1982. I lie latter used
experimental circuit boards, devel
oped by And) Bechtolsheim in the
Computer Science Department,
that would later become the basis
lor SUN Microsystems. Yeager's
system could efficiently route pack
ets for PUP, XNS, I Panel CHAOS
net protocols among networks con
nected to his router.
We deployed these router svs
tems widely at Stanford and at sev
eral other universities for academ
ic purposes. Phe overall network
ing of the Stanford campus, based
on the experimental networks de
veloped by SUM EX and the AI
Lab and Yeager's router, was
funded by the Stanford Board ol
I rustecs in 1985 and carried out
by the Network Communications
group in the central campus I I
organization. Neither Len Bosack
nor Sandy I.erner played any role

in this internal development and
deployment effort.
By the time Bosack had access
to the router source code in 1985,
multiple-protocol routers were a
relatively mature technology. The
software was licensed by Bosack
and Lerner on behallof Cisco S\s
tcins in 1986 through the Stan
ford OHice of lechnology Licens
ing, and Yeager was named in the
agreement document as the prin
ciple developer / inventor. Bo
sack's and Lerner s contributions
lay in the important (and risky) re
alization that this technology
could he made into a commercial
venture — and credit for that
should not be denied.
Still, Yeager was the Stanford
researcher who created the tech
nology leading to Cisco's found
ing and success, even though he
never benefited from that venture
and has not receiv ed public recog
nition for his contribution .

Computing, networking and
world-wide-web applica
tions are now commodities
that affect almost all aspects of our
lives. Twenty to 30 years have
passed since the invention ol
many of the underlying tec hnolo
gies leading up to this information
revolution.
We are beginning to try to gain
some historical perspective on the
people and the settings that gave
rise to these ideas, along with the
extraordinarily successful indus
tries that pace the marketplace for
derived commercial products.
Source materials for these histories
are often shaded by company mar
keters trying to extol a company's
virtues during startup, garnering
investment capital and moving to
ward public stock offerings.
Erequently, public attention is
focused only on the people who
became rich and famous as a result
of a startup (e.g., Marc Audi eesen
of Netscape or Len Bosack and

Sanely I.erner of Cisco Systems)
rather than the true inventors.
In the history of networking,
Boh Kahn, Vint Cert and Boh
Metcalfe have properly gotten
credit for the invention and de
velopment of the early
ARPANET (late 1900s), the Eth
ernet (mid-19705) and the earl\
Internet (1980s). I here is anoth
er part of this story though that
remains muddled in the public
view — the invention ol commer
cial Internet router technologies
(1980s) that make possible the in -
credible network of networks
comprising the modern Internet
and which fueled the meteoric
success of (lisco Systems.
I he origin of Internet routers
and Cisco Systems is a uniquely
Stanford story and reflects the
power of Stanford as an incubator
for new technologies. Thus, it is
important to get the record
straight about what really hap
pened so the Stanford community
can learn from this process.
Computer networking at Stan
ford has a long and productive
history. I he Stanford AI Labora
tory was among the first of the 64

nodes on the ARPANET in the
late 19605. The SUM EX-AIM
project in the Medical School was
added in 1974 and became the
first non-DoD node on the
ARPANET.
Many experiments were done
in (he tnid-to-late 1970s to inter
connect larger numbers of ma
chines, but these efforts changed
fundamentally in early 1980,

when Xerox Corporation grant
ed Stanford (along with MI I and
Carnegie Mellon University) ac
cess to their Ethernet technology.
I he Ethernet design (by Metcalfe
and Boggs) was an extraordinari
ly elegant solution to intercon

necting machines and was adopt
ed eagerly.
Phis led innnediatek to the
need lor "router technology" to
interconnect not onlv machines
on a given network segment, but
to interconnect network segments

with each other and the growing
national Internet. The SI'MEX
project initiated an effort to build
a network router and Bill Yeager
began to work on it.
Yeager produced a stable
PDI'l 1-based router by late 1981
and then a Motorola 08000-based
router by late 1982. I lie latter used
experimental circuit boards, devel
oped by And) Bechtolsheim in the
Computer Science Department,
that would later become the basis
lor SUN Microsystems. Yeager's
system could efficiently route pack
ets for PUP, XNS, I Panel CHAOS
net protocols among networks con
nected to his router.
We deployed these router svs
tems widely at Stanford and at sev
eral other universities for academ
ic purposes. Phe overall network
ing of the Stanford campus, based
on the experimental networks de
veloped by SUM EX and the AI
Lab and Yeager's router, was
funded by the Stanford Board ol
I rustecs in 1985 and carried out
by the Network Communications
group in the central campus I I
organization. Neither Len Bosack
nor Sandy I.erner played any role

in this internal development and
deployment effort.
By the time Bosack had access
to the router source code in 1985,
multiple-protocol routers were a
relatively mature technology. The
software was licensed by Bosack
and Lerner on behallof Cisco S\s
tcins in 1986 through the Stan
ford OHice of lechnology Licens
ing, and Yeager was named in the
agreement document as the prin
ciple developer / inventor. Bo
