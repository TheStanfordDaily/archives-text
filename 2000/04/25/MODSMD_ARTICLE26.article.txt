## iKena.com allows friends to browse Web together online 
### SUMMER BARGHOUTI 
E-mail; Kgreeting; AC) 1 Instant Mes
senger; ICQ; Quickdot. I he lisi of ways
to communicate with friends and familv
online continues to grow. Now there is a
new service hoping to provide a unique
and better way to talk with friends and
family: ikena.
iKena.com is a hybrid of ICQ and in
stant messaging while introducing a new
feature of allowing multiple people to
browse Web pages at the same time.
Friends who are online and have the
ikena software can invite ea< h othei to
look at the same Web page and talk
about it while it's on their screen. I here
is no limit to the numbei o! people that
can be invited, but evervone has to be
online in order for it to work.
The way ikena works is fairly
straightforward. One person enters the
Web address and the page pops up on
everybody's screen. Anything that hap
pens on one screen happens on all the
screens. For example, if one person
clicks on a link, then everylx>d\'s brows
er goes to that link. I here is ,ilso a sepa
rate window in which vou can chat and
enter your comments about what vou
are seeing.

In order foi the service to work, your
computer must first be equipped with
the ikena software. In addition to down
loading ikena, you will need Winsock
2.0 and Flash 4.0. All of these are easy to
download, which doesn't take too much
time, but this process creates added
steps that make it more complicated
than the 1 -2-3 steps advertised. With so
main steps to do, it becomes tempting to
press Cancel rather than continue with it
all.
Registering and creating an account
is straightforward and easy to do. Just fill
in the boxes and you're set. Once you
have your account, ikena operates sinii
larlv to ICQ. Vou find other users who
also share the same ikena software and
add them to your user list. ()nce they're
online, you're free to invite them to chat
and discuss Web pages.
Anyone can use ikena, even those
that have never used ICQ or any online
instant messaging program. Its Web
page is very c learh laid out and helpful.
Not onlv is there a link with answers to
the basic questions, but there is a demo
and sample page so one can lullv under
stand how it works with relative ease.
I he longest and most complicated part
ol using ikena is the clow nloading of the

program in the first plate.
Kven though ikena is simple, straight
forward and offers a unique service, its
usefulness is definitely debatable. When
would you discuss a Web page with some
one else? One possible occasion is when
you and multiple friends want to buy tick
ets for an event, which is the subject of
their demo. With so many people's sched
ules to ac commodate and so many possi
ble dates iiul times, everyone discussing it
at once would simplify the process. But of
course, you would have to coordinate
everyone being logged on at the same
time.
In addition, this service can also be
used for picking a movie, planning a vac a
tion, shopping or just discussing a page of
interest. All of these are good uses for it,
but I wonder whether it would still just be
taster for people to talk on the phone and
discuss options while oneoi both is ( beck
ing out the Web page.
Maybe for large groups of people or
for people with only one phone line, this
type of service is worthwhile. But for col
lege students with I I connections and
separate phone lines, ikena seems more
like just another way to sit in front of
your computer and procrastinate. Then
again, so is ICQ and A( )I im.
