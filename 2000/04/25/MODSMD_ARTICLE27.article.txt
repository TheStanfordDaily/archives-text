# HMOs neglect needs of patients
## HEALTH BEAT 
### JACKIE WONG 
The healthcare industn has been gaining
wide publicity lately, vet not alwavs lot the
best reasons. Browsing through the latest
headlines within the health section of I he-
New York limes, it is (lear that tin- arrival of
HMOs has produced a considerable re
sponse throughout the nation. People are
Initiated, confused and ready for a better
alternative to 1 IM( )s.
Jane F. Brock summed the general opin
ion of the public up well with the opening
sentence in her New York limes article:
"The initials I 1.M.(). stand lor health main
tenance organization, but where, I'd like to
know, is the "health maintenance" these or
ganizations are supposed to provider"
Throughout the nation, people are fius
trated with the quality of care the) are re
ceiving from HMOs. People have become
skeptical that theii health pro\ idei s ai e sin
cerely concerned with their health oi more
concerned with cutting costs or fulfilling
their quotas.
HMOs have come into the market as a
mechanism to cut costs vet have sacrificed
quality and service as well. A tvpical appoint
ment with an 11 MO-afliliated physician is
often characterized l>\ a month-long wait to
schedule a doctor's appointment, an hour
long wait once \ou get to the doctor's office
and then a five-minute period in which von
actually see the doctor.
Moreover, if you want to see a spec ialist.

von liuisi lii si go through the long process of
scheduling a general practitioner appoint
ment and then gelling a referral for a spe
cialist. I his was particularh frustrating for
senioi Olvvia I fan, who said "It's too hard to
see a specialist. First \on have to see a gener
al practitionet and then practically plead
with them so that you can see a specialist.
And even with all this hassle and poor ser
vit e, costs are si ill rising at an alarming rate."
In addition to the poorer service people
are experiencing with II M( )s. the lower costs
IIM()s are alleged to provide are also in
question. Many experts believe that HMOs
ina\ have initialh reduced costs but have not
effected the rate at which healthcare expen
ditures are rising. I his means that health
care expenditures are still rising at an alarm
ing rate even with the implementation of
HMOs.
With all this negative opinion about the
current healthcare situation, it is not surpris
ing that people are beginning to say no to the
long lines and poor service of HMOs, (ais
tomers are less willing to bare the brunt of
these cost-cutting mechanisms and are slow
l\ changing the market for healthcare.
In a recent article in the New York 1 inies
entitled "For I liose That Clan Afford. Old
style Medicine Returns," Alan (iarber, an
Fconomist and Specialist in internal medi
cine at Stanford I niversity stated, "The mar
ket is reasserting itself ... in characteristic
fashion in America, markets have emerged
v\ here thev didn't exist."
I,ike almost all commodities in America,
healthcare has also begun to be part of our
characteristic competitive market. People
are beginning to choose what doctors they
want and what kind of care they want to re
ceive for themselves rather than being sub
ject to their restrictive 11 M() plans.
Although this trend has many positive as

peels that are giving people the better service
and personal attention they have lost with
I IMOs, this better service comes at a signifi
cant price, rims, this new trend also has
many implications about quality healthcare
becoming yet another division between the
rich and poor.
With this return to traditional medical
care, it is clear that HMOs have not provid
ed the long-awaited solution to our health
care dilemma. Unfortunately, for the major
ity of the nation that can not afford to escape
theconfinesof I INK)s, we must still wait until
new ideas are proposed to fix the current
healthcare situation.
I lie internet has provided some hope for
patient empowerment and cost-savings. Pa
tients have been able to enter the doctor's of
fice with better understanding of their dis
ease and treatment, enabling them to be an
active participant in their own recovery.
This has proved effective even for cost
savings because patients understand the
pros and cons of certain treatments and arc
less inclined to follow the "technological im
perative" that has permeated throughout
the nation. People are making wiser and
more informed decisions rather than de
manding the most expensive, technological
ly-advanced treatments.
Thus, although the patient's voice within
the healthcare sector has lost authority with
the advent of HMOs, America's characteris
tic market economy and growing Internet
technology has empowered the patient with
c hoice and access to information.
