Thesis upon thesis lias been
devoted to answering the centu
ry-old question, "What makes a
great movie?" Is it the plot? The
characters? The cinematogra
phy? ()ne of my friends from high
school suggested that there was
no one factor that determined the
quality of a movie, but rather a
subtle combination of the follow
ing four attributes:
1) Bad language
2) Violence
Nudity
4) Spaceships
I he more prominently these
four elements were featured in a
movie, he concluded, the better
the movie was. Using this theory,
he dec ided that the pinnacle of
cinematic greatness is not "Citi
zen Kane" or "The Codfather,"
but rather "Stai ship Troopers."
A much easier question to an
swer is, "What makes a bad
movie?" People might find differ
ent things to hate about bad
movies, but ultimately a bad
movie is one that bores you stiff.
For instance, I can't really find
anything redeemable about the
|ean-( laude Van Damme vehicle
"Double Team," but it has some
thing (namely, Dennis Rodman
saying things like "Offense gets
the glory . . . but defense wins the
game") that other, worse movies
like "Titanic" lack. Most people
have differing opinions as to
which movies are boring, but 1
think every normal person agrees
that the most boring movie of all
time is "2001: A Space Odyssey,"
with "Star Trek: "The Motion Pic -
ture" running a c lose second. If
you don't agree, that's fine. But
you're wrong.
'The ironic thing about both of
these movies is that they're so in
credibly boring partially because
of an excess of Cood Movie Qual
ity #4 (see above). Sitting through
the famous "spaceship-docking"
scene is akin to having painful
dental surgery with the Blue
Danube playing in the back
ground (don't even gel me start
ed on the psychedelic colors scene
— if you don't fast-forward
through that, you're either
stoned or comatose). Similarly, I
would guess that the middle hun
dred pages or so of the script for
"Star Trek: The Motion Picture"
read something like this:
Long, 15-niinute shot of Kilter
prise slowly gliding through
space. Multiple shots showing the
tension-filled fact's of the Enter
prise crew. Long, 15-minute shot
of Enterprise slowly gliding
through space. Multiple shots
showing the tension-filled faces of
the Enterprise crew, in different

order.
Of course, there are those who
think that "2001" is a work of cin
ematic genius. And I won't dis
agree. Einstein was a genius, but
that doesn't necessarily mean he
was fun ai parties. I'd rather just
accept ilit* fact that it was au influ
ential movie and move on instead
of having to endure it for myself.
Anyway, all of this brings us to
our next topic: artificial intelli
gence. Both of the bad guys in the
two most boring movies ofall time
are artificial life forms who have
somehow developed conscious
ness. Will humans ever be able to
create a living machine? Or will
we just be able to create machines
that imitate human behavior in
creasingly accurately? And if a
machine can feign human con
sciousness so perfectly that no one
can tell the difference, then who's
to say that I lie* machine isn't reall\
conscious?
Alan luring, a pioneer in the
fields of mathematics and com
putability, proposed the follow
ing test, known as the Turing Test:
a human tester is given the op
portunity to speak to two entities.
One of them is human, one of
them is a computer. Both the
human and the computer try to
respond to the tester's questions
and convince the tester that they
are human. The tester then says
which of the entities he or she- be
lieves is the real human.
Turing argued that if the com
puter can successfully dupe the
tester about 50 percent of the
time, the computer has achieved
intelligence. Ii is reasonable to as
sume that, given the current state
of computing and its projected
growth, we will eventually have a
computer that can process the
vast amounts of data involved in
simple sentence constructions
quickly enough to imitate human
behavior, thus passing the '1 "ur
ing "lest.
But even if a machine man
aged to pass the luring lest,
would it be enough to then con
clude that the machine was intel
ligence? Philosopher John Searle
came up with the Chinese Room ar
gument, that goes like this:
Pretend you are locked in a
room with a slot to the outside
world. Slips of paper are passed in
through the slot, covered in Chi
nese characters — but you don't
understand Chinese.
Thankfully, you have a huge
rulebook that says exactly what to
write in response to the sequence
of characters that comes in
through the slot. To anyone out
side the room, ii appears that you
understand Chinese — when in
fact you have no idea what the
hell is going on. Do you really nu
clei stand the language?
Obviously, there is no correct
answer to the Al problem. .All I
hope is that if we do
build sentient machines, tliev
won't be as boring as they are in
the movies.

tester about 50 percent of the
time, the computer has achieved
intelligence. Ii is reasonable to as
sume that, given the current state
of computing and its projected
growth, we will eventually have a
computer that can process the
vast amounts of data involved in
simple sentence constructions
quickly enough to imitate human
behavior, thus passing the '1 "ur
ing "lest.
But even if a machine man
aged to pass the luring lest,
would it be enough to then con
clude that the machine was intel
ligence? Philosopher John Searle
came up with the Chinese Room ar
gument, that goes like this:
Pretend you are locked in a
room with a slot to the outside
world. Slips of paper are passed in
through the slot, covered in Chi
nese characters — but you don't
understand Chinese.
Thankfully, you have a huge
rulebook that says exactly what to
write in response to the sequence
of characters that comes in
through the slot. To anyone out
side the room, ii appears that you
understand Chinese — when in
fact you have no idea what the
hell is going on. Do you really nu
clei stand the language?
Obviously, there is no correct
answer to the Al problem. .All I
hope is that if we do
build sentient machines, tliev
won't be as boring as they are in
the movies.
