# Russell draws lessons from time in Borneo
## 
### PETER STAIR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Kevin Russell, a representative for the Rain
forest Awareness Project, encouraged an audi
ence of 40 to re-examine their relationship with
the environment in a speech last night to con
clude Stanford's Earth Week events.
Russell shared his experiences traveling in
the rain forests of Borneo, an island near In
donesia.
In a slide show broken by a few minutes of
rain forest sounds and concluded by a slide mon
tage contrasting sounds of the forest, chain saws,
bulldozers and c ity life, Russell emphasized our
need to feel closer to the natural environment.
"Most people don't know where their water
comes from." That information now seems irrel
evant, he said, because "we have driven a wedge
between ourselves and the environment."
Russell opened his talk by playing a radio dee
jay's reading of two native Borneans' ac count of
their travel to New York (lity. While New York
ers feigned indifference to the two men, the
Borneans described their impressions of Man
hattan Island.
"'fhe Island looks so heavy, it looks like it
could fall into the sea ... the sirens we hear all
the time, it's very alarming, a sign of danger."
One New Yorker, when told the Borneans
were to appear before the I N to advocate
preservation of their rain forest, flippantly

said, "Oil yeah, I've got a friend, he's into that."
But, to Russell and the natives who live there,
the rain forest is not merely a passing consid
eration.
"Pretty fundamentally the environment is an
issue of people," he said, explaining that it is
"how we define our well-being."
To his surprise, Russell discovered rain
forests in Borneo heing cleared away like Amer
ican forests, and he said he did not expect to see
such a high level of'commercialization.
"I was surprised to almost immediately be
greeted by Ronald [McDonald]," he said.
Criticizing the ability of advertising to create
needs and construct culture, Russell said, "It is
vital that we not sleepwalk through this [current
environmental] transformation."
He contrasted our attitude with that of the
Penan people of Borneo, who walked through
unknown forests with him, without bringing
food or a compass.
I le cited one guide who said to him, "We fol
low our feeling."
"The people were the environment—psycho
logically inseparable," Russell said.
Not only did tliev avoid damaging the forest,
Russell said, but the Penan also avoided d;imag
ing another important component of the envi
ronment.
"No one can remember a time in theii mem
ory and in their oral history where one Penan
even killed another," he said.

Upon first meeting representatives from the
tribe, Russell offered prized Bornean coastal to
bacco to one man. Before lie could oiler any to
another, the first man had already begun shar
ing what he had received. 1 hough they travel
and re-settle often, Russell said, "[ I he Penan]
are rooted in cooperation."
Russell said his trip "really began after the
third day of hiking in the forest. ()n that clay,
he decided that 1 1 clays more of hiking
through thick, mountainous forests, filled with
precarious log bridges and leeches, and with
scant supplies was an uncomfortable enough
prospect to abandon more than a year of
preparation.
But when he told his guides ol his inclination
to discontinue the hike, he recounted, "they
think I'm telling tlieni a joke and they just start
laughing."
Recognizing the different outlook of his
guides, Russell reconsidered his own. "Some
times our consciousness is altered to such a de
gree that we have to create whole new reality
maps," he said, "after that point what I did was
nothing short of completely letting go, and being
almost as a child, and having that fresh outlook."
Newh flexible and open, Russell continued
the trip.
"We should be similarly flexible and open in
order to adapt now," he said. "We must ask the
question, 'Are we borrowing [from the environ
ment] to the extent that we can pa\ it back?'"
