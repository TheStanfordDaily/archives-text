1 ii the ke\ note address for Af rica Week, Dr. Ali
Mazrui related the week's theme, "Integrating
Tradition and Innovation," to Stanford's techno
logical advantages: "Stanford alone has more
computer-literate people and more computers
than an African country of 20 million people."
The Stanford African Students Association and
the Muslim Students Awareness Network fea
tured Mazrui, a native Kenyan, to kick off the
SASA-sponsored Africa Week events. Ma/rui is
the director of the Institute of Clobal Cultural

session, Mazrui spoke of two trinities in bis ad
dress that are of \ ital importance to Africa in tran
sitioning into an era in which technology plays
such a huge part iu the economy and politics of a

second trinity of "skills, values and gender rela
tions."
In the first trinity, Mazrui explained how
Africanity, Islam and the influence of the West

help Africa make ibis transition: Islam through

Ma/rui also recognized the
changing role of women within
the Muslim culture and ad
dressed gender relations.
"The role of women is crucial.
Women in science must dissolve

In the conclusion of his speech,
Ma/rui emphasized the need to
encourage skills in computers and
technology and the need to res
cue the concept of modernization,
which is often shunned in Africa
as "an imitation of the white
lifestyle."
"Modernization needs to be a
change consistent with human
knowledge and integrated with

tradition. What is needed is the
Africanization of modernity."
