literal and metaphorical translation," according
to (iasdin.

ration between Milos/ and I lass a spec ial one is
that it is "really a co-translation. I liese people are
working together. I hese are great poets." I he
translation is not only "authorized l>\ the w liter,
but his choices are in there."
