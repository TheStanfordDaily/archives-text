# Visitors to campus experience Stanford through eyes of their guides
## Tours of Duty 
### CHRIS CUSSEN 
Before dropping out of Har
vard, Microsoft Chairman Bill
(iates was flunked by one of his pr< >-
lessors, Kric Roberts. Kventually,
this professor made his \va\ to Stan
ford to continue teaching computer
science, only to find his office in the
building funded by bis former flun
kee, now the world's richest man:
the William Cates Computer Sci
ence Building.
()i so the anecdotal legend that
some I niversitv tour guides tell vis
itors goes.
However, the Visitor Informa
tion Services tours serve a much
greater purpose than garnering a
few laughs. I'hey play an important
role in shaping the wa\ the world

views Stanford.
Thousands of tourists and
prospective students visit Stanford
every year, eager to lake a tour and
learn as much information as possi
ble Irotn their Stanford representa
tive. Mam of these visitors are
quick!) passing through and use
tile tour as their one-stop vantage
point lor discovering the I niversi
ty.
"The tour makes a big differ
ence, especially when trying to dif
ferentiate between many schools." a
recent visitor said.
Indeed, it seems that a good t< >111
can make or break the opinions of
mail) impressionable people, espe
cially high schoolers who are con
sidering applying for admission.
"As a lour guide, you are given

substantial liberty with where your
tour goes and with what informa
tion vou provide," said David
1 .avler, a sophomore who has been
leading tours for over a year.
I here are few specific restric
tions placed on the guides. If they
wish to sax something negative
about the I niversity, Visitor Infor
mation Services will support that
decision, as long as the\ are "hon
est," said Elisabeth Diana, a sopho
more tour guide.
"We want people to get an accu
rate impression of Stanford," Diana
added.
However, few negative aspects
besides c lass difficulty and campus
isolation ever pop up during tours,
according to the guides. The
guides, in general, are enthusiastic
students who are full of positive in
formation about Stanford which
they are eager to share.
There is also no conduct or dress
code imposed on the tour guides,
so they can be themselves.
"Many of the guides have their
own unique style, and Visitor In
formation Services has no problem
with that," Ixiyfer said.
Often guides conduct tours be
tween or after classes. Sophomore
Rhiannon Meier, who h;is been a
guide since January, conducts her
tour aboard her skateboard.
"People want to see you in your
element," she said.
All tour guides are given "The

Manual," a pet name for Ihe 135-
pagehandlx><>k from whit li iliey se
lectively memorize fun facts for
their tours.
One can find many interesting
factoids in the hook, including:
there are 22,000 shades of color tile
011 Memorial Church; lour of the
nine current Supreme Court Jus
tices are Stanford graduates; the
Dish was used in the 70s for top-se
cret military experiments regard
ing the effects of nuclear blasts on
the earth's ionosphere; and the
I niversity ( harged no tuition until
1920.
While acknowledging the pres
sure of the job, Diana said she "feels
honored to share her love for Stan
ford."
For those that stop at Stanford
for nothing more than a tour, the
guides become a one-way portal for
shaping their impressions and

opinions of Stanford, and Diana
feels that she and the other tour
guides form an "enthusiastic, well
rounded range of people" qualified
to share their experiences.
Ihe Visitor Information Ser
vices conducts a thorough applica
tion process to select tour guides.
There is a written application,
along with a group and individual
interview. They look for students
who are "energetic, positive and di
verse," attributes customarily asso
ciated with Stanford students.
Visitors to Stanford plate con
siderable stock in these tours. Many
current students can remember
their own days of decision, and re
call how much weight the words of
their lour guides held in pushing
them toward The Farm.
To obtain a tour guide applica
tion, students should contact Visi
