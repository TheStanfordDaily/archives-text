### DANIEL MOREAU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Jack Valenti, chairman of the
Motion Picture Association of
America, addressed intellectual
property rights and film content
issues in a speech last night in An
nenberg Auditorium.
I he event was sponsored by
Stanford in Government, the Stan
lord Film Society and the ASSL
Speakers Bureau.
Valenti spoke extensively about
intellectual property right in
movies. He said he feared that
what was happening to the music
industry, with the advent of Ml'.'Vs,
would befall motion pictures.
Valenti targeted the Internet as
the main threat to copyright laws.
"()nce broadband becomes widely
available," Valenti said, "one will
be able to download a two-hour
movie in five minutes."
As a result, Valenti said, encryp
tion will have to be foolproof be
fore movies are transmitted to the
aters digitally via satellite.
During the question and an
swer session, however, Valenti met
with strong opposition from stu
dents who embraced a greater ac
cessibility to films on the Internet.
One student, reacting to en
cryption, said, "You can continue
to make bigger and stronger locks,
but one can always break down the
door."
Another student suggested an
alternative safeguard for intellec
tual property rights: "So long as an
outing to the movies remains a so
cial event, people will be less in
dined to view movies downloaded
off the Internet in their homes."
Another important issue that
Valenti addressed was sex and vio
lence in movies, lie staunchly de
fended filmmakers' rights to ex
pression by invoking the First
Amendment.
"If there was no First Amend
ment," Valenti s.iid, "there would
be 110 Constitution at all as 1 see it."
In addition, he maintained ili.it
the sexual and violent content ol
films today is less gratuitous than it
lias been for a long time. He re
buffed claims that movies were di
rectly responsible for society's "so
called moral decay."
He asserted, "There is no
proven causality between images
of violence and crime. Movies
aren't like alcohol . . . .[where] if
you drink enough, you'll get
drunk. That's a causal relation

"All I lie students—even the
murderers—watched the same
movies, and listened to Ihe same
music."
Valenti said lie lii st realized die
importance ol the( fol

Valenti was six cars behind the
President in Dallas 011 that day, as
