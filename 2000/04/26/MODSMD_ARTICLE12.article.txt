1968
Thirty-two years ago today, 45 students
wrote a letter to the editor of I he Daily de
manding reform of the Art Department. "By
continually sponsoring token art shows and
operating a token studio art program, the
Art Department has managed to maintain

the image of foster
ing creative work,

which it has done
only to an ap-

pallingly lim-

ited ex
tent," they
wrote.

Their spe-

cific com-

plaints were

not only tren
chant but witty
as well: "Having

received a
generous
donation for

the construc-

tion of a new art building, the Art Depart
ment is proceeding to build a structure with
an architectural quality similar to that of the
Undergraduate Library, commonly called
"The UGLY.' "
The Bottom Line: Some things never
change.
