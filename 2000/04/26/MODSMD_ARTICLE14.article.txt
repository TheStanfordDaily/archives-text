LOS ANCFFFS (AP) - Four Northern Califor
nia ( arcl (lubs plan to challenge a state amendment
allowing expansion of Indian casinos, saying the
arrangement violates the U.S. Constitution be
(ause ii oilers preferential treatment based on eth
nic iiv.
I he dubs have asked Interior Secrelary Bruce
Babbitt to reject slate-tribal pacts and have Proposi
tion IA dc( hired invalid, the Fos Angeles limes re
ported today.
()peratorsol the card rooms lear the Indians will
loree them out of business by offering services tliev
can't legalh compete against.
Proposition IA was approved by voters last
Marc hand ratified compacts signed bv Cov. Cray
Davis and "><S (:alil< >rnia tribes last vear granting ex
clusive right to operate Nevada-style slot machines
.md banked c ard games.

However, attorney James Hamilton, represent
ing the card clubs and two Sacramento-area c hari
ties, c laimed in a letter to Babbitt that the arrange
ment violates the- 14th Amendment guaranteeing
equal protection under the law.
Hamilton wrote that the U.S. Supreme Court
has held that "all laws that classify citizens on the
basis of race ... are constitutionally suspect and must
be strictly scrutinized."
I ribai Chairman Richard Milanovieh of the
Agua Caliente Indians in Palm Springs dismissed
claims that Indians illegally receive preferential
treatment. He said tribes are recognized as sover
eign governmental bodies, not racial groups.
Rex Hackler, a spokesman for Babbitt's Bureau
ol Indian Affairs, echoed those claims, saying he has
heard arguments similar to the card clubs' several
times since Congress passed the Indian Caming

Regulatory Act in 1988.
"But the race theory doesn't work," he said.
Unless the Interior Department takes action on
the compacts by May 6, the agreements will become
law.
Hamilton's clients include Artichoke Joe's in
San Bruno, California Grand Casino in Pacheco,
Lucky Chances in Colma and the Oaks in
Kmeryville, as well as two charities â€” the Fairfield
Youth Foundation and Sacramento Consolidated
Charities.
Some card clubs, including the (Commerce Club
in Los Angeles County, have pledged not to oppose
implementation of Proposition IA.
"We, frankly, would like to coexist with the Indi
an casinos, rather than become embroiled in litiga
tion," said Commerce Club lobbyist Rodney
Blonien.
