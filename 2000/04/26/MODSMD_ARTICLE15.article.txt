## Supreme Court debates abortion 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —In the
Supreme Conn's most important
abortion c ase since 1992, six of the
nine justices voiced concern yester
day over ;t Nebraska law, similar to
those in 29 otliei states, banning a
surgical procedure opponents call
"partial-birth abortion."
I he emotional issue of abortion
returned to the nation's highest
court with nois\ sidewalk demon
strations outside the courtroom
hearing.
" I he state interest here is draw
ing a bright line between abortion
and infanticide," Nebraska Attor
ney General Don Sternberg argued
in seeking reinstatement of a law
that made ii a crime lor doctors to
perlorni partial-birth abortions.
But Simon Heller, representing
a Nebraska doctor, said none ol
the state's purported interests "is
sufficient to oven ide ... a
woman's interest in her health and
bodilv integritv."
I he Nebraska law, he said, is
"so broaclh written it could pro
hibit most second-trimester abor
tions" and lead to making .ill abor
tions "more dangerous lot
women."
Questions and comments from
two key justices — Sandra Da\
O'Connor and Antliom M.
Kennedy — indicated concern

over the state law's sweep.
()'(0111101 noted that the proce
dure Stenberg said was the target
of Nebraska's ban "may be very
similar to" a type of abortion used
far more often.
Partial-birth abortion is not a
medical term. Doctors call the
method dilation and extraction, or
D&X, because it involves partially
extracting a fetus, legs first, from
the uterus into the birth canal,
where the skull is cut and its con
tents drained.
A more common procedure is
dilation and evacuation, also
known as D&K. in \s hie h an arm or
leg of a live fetus may be pulled
into the birth canal during the
abortion operation.
Calling both methods "grue
some," ()'( onnor asked Stenberg,
"Do you take the position that the
st,ite ol Nebraska could also pro
hibit D&K abortions foi pre-viabil
it\ pregnancies?"
When Stenberg s;ti<l he did not
take that position "for purposes of
this case." ()'( 0111101 shot back, "It
is difficult to read the statute and
think that is so."
Justices David 11. Soiiter, John
Paul Stevens, Ruth liacler Gins
burg and Stephen G. Brever
seemed to doubt the Nebraska
law 's constitutionality.
