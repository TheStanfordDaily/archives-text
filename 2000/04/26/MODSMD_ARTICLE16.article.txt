# Clinton endorses China for WTO
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
White HouSe, seeking lo build
support for President Clinton's
top remaining economic objective,
released a letter vesterda\ signed
by 149 economists endorsing
China's entry into the World
Trade Organization.
The letter was presented at a
White House briefing by leaders
of Clinton's economic team and
Robert M. Solow. one of 13 Nobel
prize winners in economics who
signed the document.
"China's entry into the WTO
will help sustain the process of
market-oriented reform that
began there two decades ago," the
economists said in the letter,
which was also signed by 10 for
mer chairmen of the White I louse
Council of Economic Advisers
who served in both Republican
and Democratic administrations.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers called it a "once in a
generation" feat to get so many
economists representing such
widely different political views to
agree on anything.
The letter, however, was silent
on the issue which Congress will

be asked lo vote on next month
should the United States drop its
requirement that China's normal
trade privileges with the United
States be subject to an annual
review.
Opponents charge that drop
ping this requirement removes a
major lever the United States can
use to prod China on such issues as
human rights and religious free
dom.
But supporters of the perma
nent trade status say without the
change American exporters would
be denied the market-opening
benefits China is offering to gain
entry into the WTO.
Solow told reporters that those
circulating the letter wanted it to
address the principal economic
question of whether China's entry
into the WTO would be good for
the United States and the global
economy.
But he said he believed an
"overwhelming majority" of the
economists, a figure he put at
between SO percent and 90 per
cent. would also favor getting rid
of the annual congressional vote
on China's trade privileges.
