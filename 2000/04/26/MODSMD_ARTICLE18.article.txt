ISABELA, Philippines (AP) — In this region
shared by three nations — speckled with thou
sands of islands and crisscrossed by traders,
migrants, pirates and smugglers — 21 hostages
and the armed assailants who kidnapped them
have vanished.
After a fruitless two-day international search,
military officials and Muslim rebel leaders said
they remained unsure yesterday who abducted
21 people from a Malaysian resort and where the
hostages were taken.
A small Philippine Muslim extremist group
that is holding hostages of its own claimed
responsibility for the abductions from Malaysia
late Sunday, but later backed off, with a
spokesman saying he was unsure if the group was
involved. Meanwhile, the search continued in the
seas among the southern Philippines and

Malaysia and Indonesia.
The kidnapping ordeal began Sunday night.
Visitors to Sipadan Island, one of the world's top
diving resorts, saw their vacations disintegrate
into terror when six armed assailants stormed the
white-sand beaches, abducting 21 people, includ
ing at least 10 foreign tourists. An American cou
ple. James and Mary Murphy of Rochester, N.Y..
escaped by refusing to swim out to the kidnap
pers' boat and then hiding in bushes.
The hostages include at least 10 foreigners
from Germany, France. South Africa. Finland
and Lebanon. They also included a Filipino
worker and nine Malaysians, authorities said.
The nationality of the 21st hostage was not
known.
A Philippine police intelligence report said
yesterday that the hostages had been taken on

two fishing boats to Sulu province at the Philip
pines" southern tip. about one hour awav from
Sipadan. But Lt. Edgar Joseph Andres, whose
navy plane conducted a three-hour search of the
sparsely inhabited area, said he saw no signs of
the hostages.
Early yesterday, the Abu Sayyaf— the Mus
lim rebel group under siege for holding 27 Fil
ipinos hostage for five weeks — claimed respon
sibility. But later its spokesman, Abu Ahmad,
said lie was not certain the group was involved.
A waitress who escaped the abduction added
weight to the belief that Muslim rebels were
responsible.
Jeneth Cagaanan. 27. said one of the assailants
wore a vest emblazoned with the initials
"MNLF," an acronym for the Moro National
Liberation Front.
