TEHRAN. Iran (AP) â€” Iran's hard-liners have stepped up
pressure on President Mohammad Khatami, annulling another
election result in a legislative district won by a moderate Khata
mi ally.
Alarmed by the sound beating they took from reformists in
February's legislative elections, hard-liners are trying to roll back
Khatami's reforms in a bid to protect their own rule. In addition
to annulling election results in 12 seats won by Khatami allies,
they have closed 13 pro-democracy publications and jailed two
journalists in recent weeks.
The crackdown reflects the considerable power hard-liners in
the ruling clergy still wield in Iran.
State-run radio said yesterday that the Guardian Council had
annulled the election of reformist Mohammad I arrokhi to rep
resent the town of Jiroft in southern Kerman province. In addi
tion. the radio quoted a statement from the hard-line body as
saying final results for Tehran, where the pro-Khatami Interior
Ministry says the reformists won 29 of 30 seats, have been
delayed.
After yesterday's statement was broadcast on radio. Ayatol

kill Ahmad Jannati. head of the Guardian Council, denied there
was an\ plan to annul results in Tehran. But he added that
"there are irregularities which may lead to minor changes." the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
Of 12 districts where reformists' victories have been annulled,
two of the seats have been given to hard-liners. The rest are to
be contested in a new election.
At several universities around Iran, students spent the day
protesting the newspaper closures and expressing support for
Khatami.
In the southern city of Shiraz. more than 3.0(H) students rallied
at the Medical Science University, according to journalists in the
city.
At the Khajeh Naseer Technical University in Tehran, more
than 300 students cut classes and assembled outside the main
building. Speakers addressed the demonstrators through loud
speakers.
"Stand firm Khatami, stand firm Khatami." chanted the
young men and women as they sat under the morning sun. many
sipping tea and munching cookies.
