As the nation watches the story of
six-year-old Cuban refugee Elian
Gonzalez unfold, many Stanford
professors find that the case has im
plications in their fields of study.
According to Eleanor Maccoby,
professor emeritus of'developmen
tal psychology, Elain's Miami rela
tives appeared to be treating him
improperly before federal agents
raided their house to reunite him
with his father.
Klian was found floating alone in
an inner tube off the coast of Flori
da in November. Since then, his
Cuban father and American rela
tives have battled over custody.
On Saturday, federal agents
raided Elian's uncle's Miami house
to reunite him with his father after
the boy's relatives had refused to
give him up despite a government
order. A federal court of appeals is
currently deciding who should
have custody.
"If [the relatives] had been sensi
tive, they would have said things
like, 'You know that your father
loves you,'" Maccoby said. "It ap
pears that they have not been say
ing that."

List week, the Miami relatives
released a video of Elian saying he
wanted to stay in America.
Commenting on the video, Mac
coby said, "It was clear that he was
prompted." She continued, " The
video only exacerbated the political
differences."
"The impact the episode will
have on his adult life depends on
how normal a childhood he can
have in the future," she said. "He
can rebound if his life goes back to
normal."
According to Maccoby, both
Elian's father and the Cuban
regime appear eager to protect
him, although it may be difficult to
shield him from the fame that he
has gained in the United States.

politics.
"Ironically," said Karl, "[this
episode] may be an opportunity
to push for a normalization of re
lations toward Cuba. [Until
now], American policy has been
controlled by a small, well-orga
nized group [of Cuban exiles] in
Miami. This would be their first
defeat."
Karl also emphasized Cubans'
"absolutely different" immigration

status. Under current policy, any
(luban who touches American soil is
automatically given a green card.
If this policy did not exist, Con
zalez would have to applv for p<>liii
cal asylum, "li would be extremely
difficult, if not impossible, to show
that any Cuban child has a 'well
founded fear of persecution," she
said. An immigrant seeking asylum
must prove this fear.
According to Karl, World Bank
statistics show Cuba has the lowest
infant mortality rate in Latin
America. Also, all Cuban children
receive free education as well as

free milk before the age of seven.
Civen these facts, Karl feels it
would be difficult to show a fear of
persecution.
Karl noted that political and civil
rights, which might be restricted in
Cuba, "aren't critical [issues] for a
six-year old."
Karl, who recently visited Cuba,
said that most Cubans were out
raged by the whole episode. Al
though main Cubans attended a
demonstration in Havana, no one
rallied in Con/ale/ s home town be
cause, according to Karl, it was "too
painful."
