## The
						Stanford Daily Grad student voice needed on unconstitutional demerits 
### 
IS NIK NKW system of demerits — and the
entire Campaign Practices (lode that it falls
under — unconstitutional? Likely. Is the
ASSU at ;il! concerned about this? It hardly
seems so.
In.in interesting turn of events ;it yesterday's
Undergraduate Senate meeting, senators unani
mously voted to keep the demerits system for the
upcoming runofl election. 1 his action therefore
upholds a practice 1 1 i;it Constitutional Council
member Harris Shapiro admitted could be
unconstitutional, since the Graduate Student
Council lias never reviewed, and therelbre never
approved, the Campaign Practices Code, under
which the concept of "demerits" falls. In that
sense, the graduate student population has had
no s.iv in the demerits system — they originally
did not approve it, and, now, they are probably
being expected to overlook it.

I oclay, the Graduate Student Counc il will vote
on whether or not to approve the demerit rulings
on both slates that were announced by the ASSI'
Hearings Commissioner yesterday. They will not,
however, gel the chance to vote on whether or not
the demerits system itself is valid and should be
maintained.
Apparently, that — namely the validity of the
demerit system — has already been decided upon
by the Undergraduate Senate on a "technicality."
I 'his tec hnicality (Appendix 11, section 2A, 4c , of
the Joint By-laws) states that, "the Commission
shall exercise its independent judgment in the fil
ing of charges against c andidates."
Kquipped with this vague power, the Flections
Commission has made recommendations to the
Hearings Committee, which has subsequently
ac ted on those by recommending penalties in the
form of demerits — never mind that the demerit

system itself was originally conceived under the
now potentially unconstitutional Campaign Prac
tices (lode.
1 his choice to ignore unconstitutionality is not
born of ignorance, but, instead, it comes of an
ironic form of hypocrisy. Indeed, the Hearings
(Committee's rulings today were based on the Uni
versity's general policies of conduct, because the
commission admitted it could not use the ASSU
Campaign Practices Code. Why? Because most of
the committee probably agrees that it's wrong to
base rulings on an unconstitutional document.
I lowever, it also appears that most of the com
mittee feels that it's perfectly acceptable that its
rulings be passed down the form of demerits, a
product of the same unconstitutional document.
The whole concept of demerits is a shady and
ineffective one, at best. Why are there no expla
nations of what demerits are, or even what the

specific violations were for each candidate or slate
with demerits, anywhere on the ballot?
The ASSU is well aware that it is dealing with a
highly uneducated voter population that bases its
votes on the brightness of fliers or the catchiness
of slogans. Thus, a number of red dots by a per
son's name does not improve voter faculties — it
either prompts voters to choose on the basis of
violations, not platforms, or compels them to vote
for the "more rebellious"' side — while the issues
are seemingly tossed away. 1 he senate might find
it interesting that most voters still aren't sure
whether it's red or green that conveys a demerit.
The hearings process also merits evaluation —
some of the potential violations discussed at the
hearing Monday night had taken place early last
week, before elections. Why were they, then,
