The 25th Anniversary of the fall
ol Saigon. Kaster Sunday.
Janet Reno and Klian Cionza
le/. fhe premiere of "Love
and Basketball."
Last weekend was quite busy.
When I was a six-vear-old kid growing
up in the tundra of the Midwest, 1 — like
little Klian — didn't really know much
about the outside world. ((>i anted, I
wasn't embroiled in an ideological, gov-

cm ninental ( ustody I>;it

here.)
I lie Vietnam War
was si ill fresh in peo
ple's minds, and my
parents did a pretty
decent job ol sheltering
me. I wasn't allowed to
use chopsticks. I wasn't
allowed to speak Viet
namese outside our

house, and I wasn't allowed to go trick
-01 treating alone. (This was during the
ra/.oi blade-apple s< are, alter all.)
Hut, in the time since, our cultural cli
mate lias ( hanged quite a bit. flic I nited

lincl) (onie bat k to Vietnam to revisit old
battlegrounds or prison tamps. And the
\ ictnam \'elerans Memorial in Washing
ton. 1).('.., attracts more visitors than any
othci Washington incniorial.
It's been 25 vears, and the Vietnam
Wai means nothing more to some ol us
than the tvpical Oliver Stone epic, grist
foi the Hollywood mill, just another
( lit lie in our shared, cultural history.
Something to be filed in our next time
capsule alongside Watergate and 8-
I racks.
Kven |ohn McCain has returned to
Vietnam for the eighth time, shaking
hands like lie's still on the stump trail,
pledging forgiveness.
( anions word, "forgiveness."
M\ mother always tailed me a "conve
nient (latholic."
Definitely there for Christmas and
Kaster, but let's just say that my regular
Suntla\ attentlance is spotty at best.
I slept through my alarm clock last
Sunday, and believe me, if it wasn't for
the persistent and irritable knocking by
m\ roommate, 1 probably wouldn't have
made Kaster Mass at all.
My mom says I'm lucky. She reminds
me that religion in Vietnam is definitely
discouraged. And, in fact, in order to join
<i religious group, one must have govern
ment permission. Just last month, Viet
namese police reportedly beat and seized

mcmhci s of a religious group in southern
Vietnam.
It's funny — okay, maybe not funny, but
definitely interesting — lor me to juxtajx>sc
these two major (INN-level events. When I
tin ned on tlie I.V. on Sunday, all 1 heard
was Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam and Fast
er, Kaster, Faster. (I changed channels
whenever they said Klian, Klian, Klian.)
You wouldn't think that the two topics
would be so intertwined — and they
probably aren't lor most people — but 1
kepi coming back to this shared connec
tion, this issue of forgiveness.
forgiveness is pari and parcel of most
if not all — religions. It certainly plays
<i large role in the Catholic church. And
one of the most common themes in all the
press about the fall of Saigon was .ill the
talk about "lorgiveness."
South Vietnamese "forgive" North Viet
namese. Vietnamese-Americans "forgive"
Vietnamese nationals. American veterans
"forgive" Vietnamese captors. Klian's
Miami cousins "Idi give" Janet Reno. (Well,
okay, mavbc we're not there vet.)
It amazes me how easy it is for people
to forgive. We all toss the word around as
if forgiving is easy. In church, I must have
said "I forgive" at least a dozen times.
Don't gel me wrong— I really do believe
in the power of forgiveness. But I've
never been in a war or a prison camp. Or
had to Ibrgive someone who has killed
people like me.
Last week, I wrote an article that
offended a number of people (at least
judging from my PINK inbox), especially
from tlie Mathematics Department. And
while I certainly had no malicious intent,
I can c ertainly sympathize with the power
of words, 112 or that, I sincerely apologize.
It's funny how your life circles back on
you sometimes, without you even realizing
it. If I want forgiveness from others, the
least I can do is start offering my forgive
ness.
So I'll start off pretty small. Just from
ibis past weekend, I forgive Leo for
attempting to interview President (llinton
about environmental issues. ("Uinnun —
Mr. President? Did you think I itatiic was
an Karth Day movie? I mean, it was about
water!") I forgive Diane Sawyer lor som
ersaulting with Klian. I forgive all the tele
vision networks for vacuous coverage of
Vietnam, Klian and Kaster.
But most of all, I Ibrgive Omar Kpps
lor "Love and Basketball."

Adrian is a senior majoring in English with an
emphasis in (Ireative Writing. He fnomises this
will be the one and only time he mentions
Elian. Adrian also wants everyone to know that
Osi is definitely the better choice. Yon can talk
to him (diont it at adriankia Stanford.edn.
