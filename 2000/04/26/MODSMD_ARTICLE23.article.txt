ASSU president responds to Daily article,
supports Newton / Villegas
I write in response to yesterday's arti
cle in The Daily ("Commission reviewing
election improprieties") questioning my
involvement in this year's ASSU presi
dential race. I have a right to express my
opinion about which candidates I feel
would he best in my position next year,
and I would hope that, as the Stanford
student body, you would want me to
express this opinion as you make an
informed decision. 1 am proud to have
expressed my support for Seth Newton
and Malia Villegas.
1 have made phone calls to many
friends and colleagues — both inside and
outside of the ASSU — explaining my
decision to support Newton and Villegas.
I hese calls were made on my own, and I
never talked to Newton or Villegas about
them. In no way did I ever threaten or
blackmail anyone, nor did I misconstrue
the importance of my role in the ASSU
next year. I would like to stress that I did
not in any way conspire with Newton or
Villegas or interfere with any ASSU pro
cedure.
I am allowed to call students that 1
want to call and support candidates that I
want to support. I will continue to sup
port Newton and Villegas for my own
reasons: 1 have worked very hard for stu
dents for three years, and, knowing the

importance and responsibility of my job,
I simply feel that Newton and Villegas are
the better candidates. I have done noth
ing wrong, and in no way would 1 ever do
anything to undermine the integrity of
the office of the ASSL president.

Senator-elect switches his endorsement
I laving very recently dec ided to switch
my endorsement from Liu/Dudas to
Newton/Villegas, many people have
questioned my motives and the influence
thai ASSU President Mike Levin had on
my decision.
Levin did call me last Friday to discuss
the merits of the Platform for Account
ability and Change. During conversa
tions with him over the weekend, I
expressed doubts about Liu and Dudas'
platform and my thoughts that Students
First does not correctly prioritize the way
the ASSU should emphasize issues. Levin
was very supportive of PAC's position.
Never did he threaten me or "blackmail"
me. Ife is obviously a very respected per
son on this campus and would not be in
the position he is in today otherwise.
Levin would have honored my choice
either way.

Unfortunately, this election has
strayed from the issues that both slates
have presented us with. Their issues
come from two different ideologies. I
urge you to read both slates' platforms
and consider the issues carefully.
Although I respect Liu and Dudas, I, like-
Mike Levin, support Newton and Ville
gas and hope that you will join us in vot
ing for PAC.
I am excited that the student body has
had the confidence to elect me to serve as
a senator next year. Regardless of the
outcome of the election, I welcome the
chance to work with all 14 senators-elect
and ilie new president and vice presi
dent, whoever they may be, to help make
pivotal changes for the improvement of
student life.

Voters should ignore all endorsements
I'm terribly disappointed in the behav
ior of some of my friends and soon-to-be
colleagues in the ASSU. I've never paid
much attention to endorsements in any
political race tor two reasons: 1) I like to
make up my own mind, and 2) you never
know whether the endorsement was
made on the basis of principle or because
the endorsee promised a quid pro quo to
the endorser.
I've been assured that no one changed
his/her endorsement on the basis of any
promises made to him/her. 1 hat may be
true, but even so there remains at least
the appearance of impropriety. 1 don't
intend to endorse anvone, and I strongly
encourage voters to ignore all the
endorsements. It you don't know any
thing more than who endorsed whom,
then do us all a favor and don't vote.

Newton best choice for president
I have never written to Ihe Daily
before. But never before have I been so
compelled bv something on campus as
the recent ASSL presidential runoff.
I am a senior not running any organi
zation so I in not sure ot my credentials to
be writing this, but I have run across Seth
Newton on various projects I have been
affiliated with over the years. Simply,
from these interactions alone, I feel he
would make a better student president
than any other person I have met on
campus.
We have a fantastic opportunity for a
student president the likes of which we
have not seen around here for a long,
long time, if ever. Seth has constantly
impressed me to the point of admiration.
Whether it's finding out about the sum
mer camp he has founded in his native
Oregon, the groups and campaigns he
has coordinated on campus, or the art
show lie helps put together on campus, I
am always impressed In his ability to
think and then put his thoughts into well
organized. effective action.
fo me it is really unbelievable, and it
inspires me to do the same no matter my
own numerous deficiencies in making
things work. Right now, the students of
Stanford have a wonderful opportunity
to usher in a new student voice who I am
so certain will do a wonderful job that I
write this first letter to The Daily right
before graduation.
I humbly ask you to vote for a person
who, with youi help, I know can accom
plish very much for students and the Uni
versity at large.

ASSU not the place for political parties
Regarding Nick Kapur's letter on
political parties ("PAC is a political party,
not a platform") and Kate Arnold's
response in The Daily yesterday ("Sup
port lor I'AC. and concept of political par
ties in general"), political parties in gener
al are not bad /»') se, but I would certain
ly be alarmed if they were to appear at
Stanford.
Political parties serve an important
purpose in American society and in world
society. Parties are needed to direct peo
ple's political inclinations, whether con
servative or liberal, toward attainable leg

islative goals. That's why in most democ
racies around the world, there are politi
cal parties. 1 hey exist tor a purpose, and
it they were had, we wouldn't have them.
However, at an institution like Stan
ford, political parties would clearly be a
hindrance to policy-making. 1 here is no
need to form cohesive political parties,
since the scale of the ASSLi is small. With
only 15 senators and a constituency of just
over 1 (),()()(), and with legislative powers,
which, frankly, are not all that great in the
first place, the costs of having political
parties here (partisan politics) are much
greater than the benefits (a more directed
legislative agenda).
If you don't believe me, just turn to
our friendly rival across the Bay, UC-
Berkelev. With a student body of more
than twice the size of Stanford's, Berke
ley's ASI (] has managed to get very little
done over the years precisely because
political parties exist in the ASL C there.
Partisan bickering and partisan politics
have exacerbated, and even alienated,
much of the student body because the
result is that nothing gets accomplished
(read dailycal.org for more info).
A final point is that in most smaller
cities in America (population under one
million), c ity councils are non-partisan for
the same reasons 1 have cited. The scale is
simply too small to justify political parties.
I'm glad to hear that PAC will disband at
the end of the election process, but, if
they do not, I'd be worried, for it could
very well be the beginning of a new, more
partisan, more gridlock-filled era of stu
dent government.

ASSU should stop melodrama
This is for the ASSU: this is just a
reminder for you all to stop taking your
selves so seriously. You guvs are what the
student council was in high school. Just a
big election whose results are dependent
upon how many people you know and
how many fliers you can put up, and all
this for a group of people who meet once
a week and don't really do that much.
Stop the whole "political alliance"
thing, the "we senators support" this-or
that candidate. Its not cute or funny, for
that matter, and it just brings to the ASSU
what everyone in America hates about
politics: petty bickering and divisive coali
tion. So, in a phrase: QUI I BEIN(J DRA
MATIC. Okay, thanks!

Srinivasan "misses the point"
As a community of educated people,
most of us probably know, as Balaji Srini
vasan points out, that the world isn't par
ticularly fair. Some of us (the "smart"
ones) get to go to Stanford and enter the
world of highly-paid, appreciated work.
Some of us work day-in and day-out for
minimum wage and no benefits. That's
just the way it is — and no amount of
"white upperclass guilt politics" is going
to change that.
Or so Srinivasan would have us
believe. In bis response to Jennifer Wek
selbaiun s column in yesterday's Daily
("Janitors column misses the point"),

Srinivasan puts forth a lot of economic
rules to explain why "unskilled" workers
get paid less, don't have job protection
and must struggle to support their fami
lies. His arguments may be right — there
is always someone to take a job when
workers go on strike, always someone
willing to work lor a little less. But I think
he misses Wekselbauni's point. The real
question is: should it be this way?
His letter suggests not-so-subtly that
those working in unskilled positions
should take what they can get and not
expect more. I lis argument that, "it is sin
gularly irresponsible to have children if
one is incapable of feeding and clothing
them properly," and that we should work
to, "increase birth control awareness"
demonstrates an unbelievable degree of
self-righteousness.
Birth control awareness may well be an
issue that deserves time and effort in our
country as a whole. But the idea that
these efforts be targeted at the poor and
the less privileged implies that those indi
viduals are somehow undeserving of chil
dren. I hese statements are discriminato
ry and they are wrong.
We live in a time of incredible dispari
ties, in an area where the extremes of
wealth and poverty can be surreal. It is
right and logical to question why this is, to
ask for somnons, to work to make it bet
ter. The students who are standing by the
janitors do so not out of passing feelings
of privileged guilt, but because of one
profound belief: that everyone at this uni
versity deserves to be treated with equal
respect.
in truth, this "skilled" economy relies
as much as ever on the hard work ol those
who clean our bathrooms, serve our fixxl,
sell our groceries and take out the trash.
Stanford University and the business
community that surrounds it have the
opportunity, in this time of economic
prosperity, to recognize the importance
of that work with fair wages and decent
benefits.
By providing better pay, better treat
ment on the job, health benefits and c hild
care support to its employees — and not
relegating these issues to the generosity of
student special fees — the I niversit)
could prove that it values AI. I. of its work
ers, not just those with computer skills
and advanced degrees.

srnmi,

Srinivasan ignores larger social issues
I would like to respond to Balaji Srini
vasan's letter regarding a living wage for
janitors. As an economist, he has .1 full
grasp on why janitors are paid what the)
are, namely because there is a substantial
labor pool and because the job does not
require extensive training (such as an
expensive university education).
However, in the academic sphere of
economics, it is easy to see the world .is
wholly explained and guided In econom
ic efficiency and to ignore social change
that occurs through other mechanisms.
We don't have nutrition labeling laws,
automobile safety regulations, or < lean air
acts because they were the economical!)
efficient thing to do.
These important steps occurred
because people fought for them, and
because people in general hold values
other than economic efficiency. We now

have a movement at Stanford (and all
around the country) of janitors voicing
their need lor a living wage. Stanford stu
dents support this movement because we
value the abilitv of every person to raise a
family while maintaining a decent stan
dard of living.
I'd now like to address several specific
points made l>\ Srinivasan. He argues
that inequality of income is due, in part,
to individual differences, namely intelli
gence. 1 lie difference is not in intelli
gence, but in circumstances that lead to
our social positions. Il is so easv to forget
these circumstances, such ;is access to
education and tuition nionev, that allow
us to be here, and so common to c redit il
entirely to superior intelligence
Main of us would like to mitigate the
consequences of these arbitrar\ circum
stances by raising the wages, and subse
quently the social status, of traditionally
lower status jobs.
Srinivasan attempts to justify mini
mum wage differences between students
and janitors by comparing their skill lex
els. However, since both groups are per
forming unskilled jobs, the wage differ
ence highlights a social inequality: Our
time is valued more because we are stu
dents at an elite university rather than
low-income adults trvjngTo s.UppMtl fam
ilies. ''
In addition, when we consider the
needs of janitors and student workers, we
see that the high cost of living in the Bay
Area would certainly require a high min
imum wage for both.
Finally, I would like to address the sug
gestion that instead of society providing a
living wage, janitors should stop having
families. While finnih planning and per
son.il responsibility are important, these
don't replace economic justice.
Allowing the rich to propagate while
condemning the poor for doing the same
ignores the basic interest in .ill people,
regardless of social c lass, of Inn ing a fam
ily and passing on their c ulture and val
ues to the next generation.

Turkish student responds to charges
of Armenian Genocide
The Armenians have been feverishly
trying to attach a charge of genocide on
the Turks for the past 84 vears 01 so. In
the relentless pursuit ol it, the\ have
declared April 24 as the date of com
memoration of this "alleged genocide."
The Biiiisli were the closest party to
these events from 191") to 1922 because
the) were the principal occupying powei
of the Ottoman Kinpire and its capital,
Istanbul, and the Ottoman archives etc.
As such, the British led .111 international
war ( limes tribunal 011 the island of Malta
to stand a trial.
After a wide-scale frantic search of all
the archival material in the British and
the I'.S. possession tlie\ concluded: "I
regret to inform YOlll Lordship that
there was nothing therein whit h could be
used as evidence against the links who
are being detained Ibi trial at Malta. Hav
ing regarded this stipulation and the fact
that the reports in the possession of the
Department of State do not appeal in am
case to contain evidence against these
lurks that would be useful even for the
purpose ol corroborating information

already in possession of llis Majesty's
Government, 1 fear that nothing is to be
hoped from addressing any further
inquiries to the U. S. Government in this
matter." (Foreign Office document
71/6504/E.8519. R.G. Graige, British
Embassy in Washington to Lord Gurzon,
No. 722, of July 13, 1921.)
Subsequently, all the Ottoman
detainees were dismissed of charges and
exchanged for the British prisoners in
Turkey. And there were no war crimes
charges, let alone a charge of "genocide"
of the Armenians.
Furthermore, 69 academicians
(including Prof. Justin McGarthy of the
University of Louisville, Prof. |.G. Hure
witz of Columbia University and Prof.
Stanford Shaw ol'U'GlA.), who specialize
in I urkish, Ottoman and Middle Eastern
Studies, sent a letter to the Members of
the U.S. House of Representatives on
May 19, 1985, concerning the "alleged"
Armenian genocide.
In their letter, they stated that: "The
weight of evidence so far uncovered
points in the direction of serious inter
communal warfare (perpetrated by Mus
lim and Glu istian irregular forces), com
plicated In disease, famine, suffering and
massacres in Anatolia and adjoining areas
during the First World War. Indeed,
throughout the years in question, the
region was the scene of more or less con
tinuous warfare, not unlike the tragedy
which lias gone on in Lebanon for the
past decade. Ihe resulting death toll
among both Muslim and Christian com
munities of the region was immense."
In light of all these facts, 1 hope the use
of the word "Holocaust" throughout the
letter by the Armenian Students Associa
tion in Monday's Dail\ ("Remembering
the Armenian Genocide") is nothing
more than a mistake. I find equating a
civil war to the Holocaust of Jews a very
low and hypocritical attempt to gain cred
ibility at the expense of the millions of
Jews that suffered throughout World
War 11 at the hands of Nazis.
I also would like to applaud the
integriivoi I he Dail\ Gal's decision to use
the term "alleged in front of the term
"genocide." I heir policy of, "... when
referring to incidents that are in dispute,
whether b\ one or main, is to reference
the incident as disputed; in most cases,
the preferred word is alleged ..." gives
me the confidence thai, despite the bar
rage of one-sided information coming
from Armenians, American youth are still
out there looking foi fac is in the dark,
undeterred by the lack of representation
of the Turkish side.
