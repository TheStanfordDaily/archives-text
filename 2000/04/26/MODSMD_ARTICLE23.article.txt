ASSU president responds to Daily article,
supports Newton / Villegas
I write in response to yesterday's arti
cle in The Daily ("Commission reviewing
election improprieties") questioning my
involvement in this year's ASSU presi
dential race. I have a right to express my
opinion about which candidates I feel
would he best in my position next year,
and I would hope that, as the Stanford
student body, you would want me to
express this opinion as you make an
informed decision. 1 am proud to have
expressed my support for Seth Newton
and Malia Villegas.
1 have made phone calls to many
friends and colleagues — both inside and
outside of the ASSU — explaining my
decision to support Newton and Villegas.
I hese calls were made on my own, and I
never talked to Newton or Villegas about
them. In no way did I ever threaten or
blackmail anyone, nor did I misconstrue
the importance of my role in the ASSU
next year. I would like to stress that I did
not in any way conspire with Newton or
Villegas or interfere with any ASSU pro
cedure.
I am allowed to call students that 1
want to call and support candidates that I
want to support. I will continue to sup
port Newton and Villegas for my own
reasons: 1 have worked very hard for stu
dents for three years, and, knowing the

importance and responsibility of my job,
I simply feel that Newton and Villegas are
the better candidates. I have done noth
ing wrong, and in no way would 1 ever do
anything to undermine the integrity of
the office of the ASSL president.

Senator-elect switches his endorsement
I laving very recently dec ided to switch
my endorsement from Liu/Dudas to
Newton/Villegas, many people have
questioned my motives and the influence
thai ASSU President Mike Levin had on
my decision.
Levin did call me last Friday to discuss
the merits of the Platform for Account
ability and Change. During conversa
tions with him over the weekend, I
expressed doubts about Liu and Dudas'
platform and my thoughts that Students
First does not correctly prioritize the way
the ASSU should emphasize issues. Levin
was very supportive of PAC's position.
Never did he threaten me or "blackmail"
me. Ife is obviously a very respected per
son on this campus and would not be in
the position he is in today otherwise.
Levin would have honored my choice
either way.

Unfortunately, this election has
strayed from the issues that both slates
have presented us with. Their issues
come from two different ideologies. I
urge you to read both slates' platforms
and consider the issues carefully.
Although I respect Liu and Dudas, I, like-
Mike Levin, support Newton and Ville
gas and hope that you will join us in vot
ing for PAC.
I am excited that the student body has
had the confidence to elect me to serve as
a senator next year. Regardless of the
outcome of the election, I welcome the
chance to work with all 14 senators-elect
and ilie new president and vice presi
dent, whoever they may be, to help make
pivotal changes for the improvement of
student life.

Voters should ignore all endorsements
I'm terribly disappointed in the behav
ior of some of my friends and soon-to-be
colleagues in the ASSU. I've never paid
much attention to endorsements in any
political race tor two reasons: 1) I like to
make up my own mind, and 2) you never
know whether the endorsement was
