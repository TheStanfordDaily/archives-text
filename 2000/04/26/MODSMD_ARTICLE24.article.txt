# Rethinking Stanford education in the Holy Land
## 
### DEREK JACKSON GUEST COLUMNIST 
My sophomore year in one word: DIS
ILLUSIONMENT. Convinced that edu
cation connoted suffering, and that the
Bio (lore was only useful as a cure for
insomnia, I thumbed through the pages
<>l the Sophomore Seminar Catalogue last
December noting the pre-ined seminars
with ;i solemn sense of obligation: "Ilium .
..this one discusses glands ... and this
one is about prostates. . . wow, every pre
ttied s dream. I should probably apply."
But suddenh nn pathetic Tack of'pas
sion slapped me right in the face with the
words, 'Earthquakes and Archaeology in
the Eastern Mediterranean."
I he c lass was to entail a spring break
field trip visiting various archaeological
and geological sites iu Israel and Jordan,
and, what s more, the professor appeared
to actually have a personality (is that

allowed?).
After quickly dismissing the preposter
ous thought of attending such an inter
esting class, 1 did something entirely
uncharacteristic for us pre-meds— I took
a ( lass because I wanted to.
But at the first clay of Geophysics 50Q,
my, and every other Stanford student s
.unspoken suspicion was once again con
finned — Stanford students are weird.
Not just quirky or unique, but down
tight, unabashedly bizarre.
I adeptly identified the respective fac
tions of weirdness that sat around me.
There were the Anthro-femi-nazis in the
back; in the corner sat the sorority girls;
to tti) right were the "individuals;" and
lastly there was the miscellaneous group
whose weirdness could not yet, but sure
ly would be confirmed.
The professor, Amos Nut (apparently
unfazed by the . . . um . . . diversity of the
group he stood before) proceeded to

introduce his research and the uncon
ventional scope of the course — how the
combination of two academic fields that
had previously ignored each other could
together elucidate big chunks of history.
It was so original and esoteric in com
parison to my dull introductory courses
that tin corrupted expectations of what
made a "true" academic class made me
doubt the c lass was for me. Just the first
day and I had already given up hope that
any Stanford class could actually inspire
me to want to learn again.
However, 10 weeks later I sat on a
plane heading to lei Aviv, thoroughly
engaged in a religious discussion with an
intriguing classmate whom I hadn't even
attempted to befriend dining the quar
ter. Suddenly, the uncomfortable
thought that 1 had been wrong about
everything this year (i.e. my education,
my classes and the people I was sur
rounded by) flashed across my mind.

I he idea grew as another great class
mate and I wandered tlie streets of
Jerusalem at 5 a.m. and stumbled upon
the Wailing Wall, feeling very American
and very much like sore thumbs. And it
swelled again north of the Sea of Calilee
.is 1 stared at a Crusader fortress split in
two by earthquakes — the tangible proof
of what our professor had been swearing
by all quarter.
1 he revolution of thought was nearly
complete as I (with a sincere interest that
would have been embarrassing 10 days
earlier) questioned Israeli geophysicist
Hagai Ron on the fundamentals of pale
omagnetism. And it culminated as I stood
atop Mt. Nebo, where Moses had suppos
edly stood and looked out across the
Holy l.and; i thought about humanity
for the first time ever.
So, a few weeks and a couple hundred
life-changing experiences later, I'm left to
shuffle through inv photos and ruminate

on how out- ( lass changed my percep
tions of the world, history, science, peo
ple, and even Stanford. It terrifies me to
think that I almost passed up such an
opportunity just because I was too igno
rant and jaded to recognize its worth.
So, with that sentiment in mind, I've
dedicated myself to only taking classes
that display the same potential to chal
lenge niv misconceptions and inspire me
to learn (sorry, Bio Core — sadly, you
didn't make the cut).
And, at the risk of being dangerously
open with my emotions, I'd have to say
that 1 in pretty damn content nowadays.
My classes are great, and when I see one
of those "weird" kids sitting next to me
now, I simply recall bobbing up and
down in the Dead Sea with 1U weirdos
who turned out to be hilarious and fasci
nating friends.

I)ereh Jackson is an undeclared sophomore.
