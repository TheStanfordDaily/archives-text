## Chasing the Cup: a one-sided race 
### 
As all four of you out
there who regularly
read USA Today
know, it's Sears Cup
standings time again. Stanford
leads the field at 970 points,
with Michigan 194.5 points be
hind. Ho-hum.
This quarterly ritual, in
which the National .Association
of College Directors of Athletics
publishes rankings of the best
all-around college athletic pro
grams in tht- country, is tradi
tionally a time for solemn,
sober, self-reflective pride in
the athletic department here,
which often runs along the lines
of press releases reading
" WOOOOOO! IN VOIR
FACE, IVY LEAGUE! WE
GOT ALL THE JOCKS!" and
signed "Big Papa led."
But I am not one for gloat
ing. Enough self-congratulato
ry prose has been written about
Stanford's five-year Sears Cup
run to till the tumbleweed
blown shelves of Meyer Li
brary.
No, I'm here to play the
devil's advocate, to take the
side of the underdog, to put
myself in the shoes of the poor
folks at Sears who thought
they were getting a nationally
covered athletic super-compe
tition and instead got USA vs.

Grenada.
I'm here to
ask: how can
the streak be
ended? How
can the Sears
Cup be
changed to
prevent an
eternal string

of Stanford blovvouis?
1 caution you reactionaries
out there not to string me up as
a traitor. I like that we have so
mam of those Waterlbrd crys
tal trophies that they're stub
bing their cigarettes out on
them over in Arrillaga.
But I also think that this
mai rosport plaved among ath
letic directors could use more
competition than the ltch\ i<:
Scratchy cartoon we have
today.
Imagine if the women's ten
nis NCAA championships
weren't just a chance for head
coach I rank Brennan to bring
home another championship
trophv out of which to serve
punchâ€” il it meant the differ
ence between "the best" and
"also-ran."
Let's agree that competition
is valuable. It's America; we
