## Chasing the Cup: a one-sided race 
### 
As all four of you out
there who regularly
read USA Today
know, it's Sears Cup
standings time again. Stanford
leads the field at 970 points,
with Michigan 194.5 points be
hind. Ho-hum.
This quarterly ritual, in
which the National .Association
of College Directors of Athletics
publishes rankings of the best
all-around college athletic pro
grams in tht- country, is tradi
tionally a time for solemn,
sober, self-reflective pride in
the athletic department here,
which often runs along the lines
of press releases reading
" WOOOOOO! IN VOIR
FACE, IVY LEAGUE! WE
GOT ALL THE JOCKS!" and
signed "Big Papa led."
But I am not one for gloat
ing. Enough self-congratulato
ry prose has been written about
Stanford's five-year Sears Cup
run to till the tumbleweed
blown shelves of Meyer Li
brary.
No, I'm here to play the
devil's advocate, to take the
side of the underdog, to put
myself in the shoes of the poor
folks at Sears who thought
they were getting a nationally
covered athletic super-compe
tition and instead got USA vs.

Grenada.
I'm here to
ask: how can
the streak be
ended? How
can the Sears
Cup be
changed to
prevent an
eternal string

of Stanford blovvouis?
1 caution you reactionaries
out there not to string me up as
a traitor. I like that we have so
mam of those Waterlbrd crys
tal trophies that they're stub
bing their cigarettes out on
them over in Arrillaga.
But I also think that this
mai rosport plaved among ath
letic directors could use more
competition than the ltch\ i<:
Scratchy cartoon we have
today.
Imagine if the women's ten
nis NCAA championships
weren't just a chance for head
coach I rank Brennan to bring
home another championship
trophv out of which to serve
punch— il it meant the differ
ence between "the best" and
"also-ran."
Let's agree that competition
is valuable. It's America; we


Jeff Cooper
like free markets. We don't want
to be the communist athletic: de
partment, growing tat on ineffi
ciency; we want to be the Roc ke
feller athletic department, the
J.P. Morgan Al), grappling with
other giants of industry and
trampling the weak under our
mighty feet.
The question then becomes:
how does one handicap this pro
gram? Stanford has led the Sears
Cup standings in ever) season
since the winter of 199(i and 17
out of the 22 seasons since the
Cup was invented. Clearly, the
current scoring structure doesn't
give most schools the faintest
chance at the crown.
Many have inquired as to the
reasons why Stanford athletics
manage to fit the model NACDA
has created so well. Suffice it to say
t hat no other school puts up tour
nament finishes — and high tour
nament finishes — in nearly the
breadth of sports that Stanford
does. With the current scoring, in
which second through ()4th place
count for something significant,
Stanford simplv has too many

teams finish well for other schools
to catch up.
So what can be done short of
Mic rosoft-esque sanctions on the
Stanford athletic department?
Shall we separate this monopolis
tic university, perhaps, into two
competing athletic schools? lt d
be tough to swallow — you'd have
to choose where to apply by
whether you'd rather watch bas
ketball or baseball.
Short of that, it's hard to say.
l hree years ago, many would
have told you Stanford's domina
tion in sports that didn't make any
money — tennis, women's basket
hall, water polo — was what car
tied them. Were that so, all that
would be needed would be to in
crease the importance of "big
money" sports like football and
men's basketball, in the Sears Cup
standings; one could justify it by
saying those sports were most im
portant to television and thus the
fan base.
()f course, coining off the Rose
Bowl and a third straight top-10
finish for the men's basketball
team, that idea doesn't look so
hot.
Shall we reduce the number of
sports that can count toward the
Sears Cup? But then we're penal
izing breadth of excellence, which

is shooting the idea ot "best all
around athletics" right in the loot.
No, the only fair way to do this,
1 think, is to force schools to play
lor all the marbles. 11 national
championships were worth, say,
10 or 20 times as many points as a
second-place finish, it'll give
schools that secure multiple
championships an insurmount
able edge.
Sure, Stanford'll have a cou
ple of years when it'll run awa\
with the trophy, as in '97-'9B
when we pulled in five national
titles, but that's no different
from now, and the new system
gives schools with a couple great
finishes a big edge. In that sys
tem last year, (leorgia, with four
titles, would have taken the
crown from Stanford, with only
one.
It's not perfect. And it saw full)
arbitrary — one shot, one catch
could win a title and pul a school
ahead lor good. But il NACUA
and Sears want to cjuit their annu
al shuffle out to campus every fall
to hand over the Stanford Cup,
they'd better starting thinking
about a change.

Let's agree that competition
is valuable. It's America; we

like free markets. We don't want
to be the communist athletic: de
partment, growing tat on ineffi
ciency; we want to be the Roc ke
feller athletic department, the
J.P. Morgan Al), grappling with
other giants of industry and
trampling the weak under our
mighty feet.
The question then becomes:
how does one handicap this pro
gram? Stanford has led the Sears
Cup standings in ever) season
since the winter of 199(i and 17
out of the 22 seasons since the
Cup was invented. Clearly, the
current scoring structure doesn't
give most schools the faintest
chance at the crown.
Many have inquired as to the
reasons why Stanford athletics
manage to fit the model NACDA
has created so well. Suffice it to say
t hat no other school puts up tour
nament finishes — and high tour
nament finishes — in nearly the
breadth of sports that Stanford
does. With the current scoring, in
which second through ()4th place
count for something significant,
Stanford simplv has too many

teams finish well for other schools
to catch up.
So what can be done short of
Mic rosoft-esque sanctions on the
Stanford athletic department?
Shall we separate this monopolis
tic university, perhaps, into two
competing athletic schools? lt d
be tough to swallow — you'd have
to choose where to apply by
whether you'd rather watch bas
ketball or baseball.
Short of that, it's hard to say.
l hree years ago, many would
have told you Stanford's domina
tion in sports that didn't make any
money — tennis, women's basket
hall, water polo — was what car
tied them. Were that so, all that
would be needed would be to in
crease the importance of "big
money" sports like football and
men's basketball, in the Sears Cup
standings; one could justify it by
saying those sports were most im
portant to television and thus the
fan base.
()f course, coining off the Rose
Bowl and a third straight top-10
finish for the men's basketball
team, that idea doesn't look so
hot.
Shall we reduce the number of
sports that can count toward the
Sears Cup? But then we're penal
izing breadth of excellence, which

is shooting the idea ot "best all
around athletics" right in the loot.
No, the only fair way to do this,
1 think, is to force schools to play
lor all the marbles. 11 national
championships were worth, say,
10 or 20 times as many points as a
second-place finish, it'll give
schools that secure multiple
championships an insurmount
able edge.
Sure, Stanford'll have a cou
ple of years when it'll run awa\
with the trophy, as in '97-'9B
when we pulled in five national
titles, but that's no different
from now, and the new system
gives schools with a couple great
finishes a big edge. In that sys
tem last year, (leorgia, with four
titles, would have taken the
crown from Stanford, with only
one.
It's not perfect. And it saw full)
arbitrary — one shot, one catch
could win a title and pul a school

and Sears want to cjuit their annu
al shuffle out to campus every fall
to hand over the Stanford Cup,
they'd better starting thinking
about a change.
