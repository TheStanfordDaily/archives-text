Call it drama. Call it suspense.
Call it unbelievably intense.
However one refers to the
events that played out this Tues
day at the Stanford Softball Com
plex, they were saturated with en
tertainment up until the very end.
What began as a seemingly typ
ical day of college softball with No.
12 Stanford (38-12, 4-8 Pacific 10
Conference) hosting non-confer
ence opponent Sacramento State
(20-23) for an afternoon double
header eventually developed into
one of this year's most extraordi
narv and obscure match-tips yet.
lu tact, the second game's final
of 1 1-5 seems more reminiscent of
a tee-ball contests final outcome
than the score of a collegiate soft
ball game, especialh with squads as
talented as No. 12 Stanford and
Sac State in the mix.
The Cardinal leveled the Hor
nets 2-1 the first game and then
took the field again at 1 p.m., de
termined to give its head coach,
John Kittmau, the lf>oth win of his
career.
Yet. the players did more than
just secure the victory tor their var

ing the fans the show of their lives.

trend of winning b\ the skin of it's

Stanford freshman Maureen

and improved her record to 6-3
overall.
With one win under their belt,
the Stanford players were anxious
to squelch the trend of splitting the

annual cloubleheader with Sac
State once and for all.
However, after the Hornets
came out on a rampage, scoring
five runs in the top of the first off
five hits and one Cardinal error,
the prospects of overcoming the
three year curse seemed dim.

Down 5-0, the players refused
to lower their heads and soon the
game's true heroine emerged in

lead with a two run homer that
staled the center-field fence.
Il would not be her lasi of the
day.
"W hen you're down 3-0, there's
not much you can do," Ritlinan
said. "You can't just plav lor one
run, but just work hard at chip
ping away at their lead."
And bov, did the) chip. And
chip. And chip some more.
in fact, the (Cardinal found its
rhvlhin and wound up crossing
home-plate a total of nine more

times in the filth and sixth innings.
"We couldn't score for a few in
nings .ind then, ;ill the sudden
everyone started hitting," said

through the order in the fifth."
Ip until the fifth, the Cardinal
had everyone looted but them
selves that it was going to get away
with this one.
"We have been down belbre,"
Rittman said. "Our team has
learned to come back bv putting
some defensive pressure on the
other team and getting those time
ly hits."
Beeson belted out a triple in the
fifth and another home-run in the
sixth, lacking up an astounding

seven RBlson the day.
"One of the nice things about
having your opponent score a lot
of runs early on, is that you then
have seven innings to come back,"
said Beeson. "Sometimes you just
see the ball realh well. I hat s what
happened to me. The ball looked
as big as a basketball. 1 just love
when that happens."
All in all, it may have been a wild
way to victory, but two wins were
tacked on to the Cardinal's record
nevertheless.
Next, Stanford prepares to face
the wrath of No.UClAand No.

Sunday on the road as Pac-10
competition kicks back into full
swing.
