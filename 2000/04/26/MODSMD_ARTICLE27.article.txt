# Palacios ends career on Farm on his terms

### MEGHAN O'CONNOR STAFF WRITER 
On a team dominated bv treshmen and
loaded with inexperience is one player who's
seen it all.
He's experienced the rush of winning a
national championship and the disappoint
ment of not qualifying lot playoffs. I le'sseen
the team come together when it had to and
collapse when it shouldn't have. And he's
lasted through two shoulder surgeries and
live seasons.
But last weekend with the team's exit from
playoffs, fifth-year senior captain |osh I'ala
cios said goodbye to Stanford men's vollev
ball.
"I thought it was a good way to end my
volleyball experience, with everyone putting
out a great effort," I'alacios said ol the team's
live-game match with No. 2 IVpperdine in
thefirst round ol the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation playoffs. "1 hope the rest of the
guys are luck) enough to have that kind ol ef
fort put out foi their last match as well."
I hough bene lied most of the season while
recovering from shoulder surgery, I'alacios
was a vital contributor to the squad as the
onl\ senior. Quiet bv nature and unable to
lead the team on the- court. I'alacios was chal
lenged with the responsibility of helping
seven freshmen adjust to collegiate volley
ball.
"It was tough for me being out," I'alac ios
said. "1 fell like I didn't have much c redibili
ty. I hat's one of the reasons I rushed back.
()n Marc h less than four months after
surgery, I'alacios joined Stanford's lineup.
Despite limited range of motion in liis right
arm tli.it still prevents him from spiking or
serving, the senior took to the court as libero,
a defensive specialist position introduced to
men's collegiate volleyball this season.
"l.ven without full range of motion in his
right arm, he was one of our best defensive
players and passers." said head coach Ruben
Nieves. "Ii made a lot of sense for him to play
libero. It really showcased the strengths of
Josh's game, which are in the back row. It was
his saying grace; without ii he couldn't have

played very much this season."
Palacios competed in Stanford's final 1 1
matches of the season, including the upset
victory against No. 1 Long Beach State on Se
nior Night where he mate lied his career high
in digs with 17.
Palacios' teammates took note of his tri
umphant return to the court, and his dedica
tion to the program onlv increased the re
spect the\ had for their captain.
"Ife had a career-threatening injury and
worked realh hard to rehab and get back,"
said redshirt freshman Setli Ring. "He made
a huge contribution when other gins might
have just thrown in the towel."
It would have been easy for Palacios to
take his 1997 National Championship ring
and throw in the towel at the end of last sea
son. The shoulder surgery that kept him out
during his sophomore year hadn't ended his
shoulder problems and he continued to sut
ler from chronic shoulder dislocations
throughout his career.
But hist season when the team unexpect
edly lost tour of its top plavers and failed to
make the playoffs for the first time in 10
years, it just didn't seem like the right wax to
end.
"I didn't feel complete ending m\ career
not making the playoffs," Palacios said. "In
order for me to have closure to m\ volleyball
experience I felt like I had to come back and
guide the program to where it should be."
The downside of his return \v;is it meant
another shoulder surgery, but the upside
was that it also meant a season to pla\ on the
court with his brother (on, a sophomore who
had redsliirted the season before.
"[My brother was] one of the reasons that
1 wanted to come plav at Stanford." Jon Pala
cios said. "1 ahvavs watched him pl«i\ when I
w as younger, lie's been a great inspiration for
me and it's been a great experience playing
with him."
So this season when both Jon and Josh

And looking back Palacios lias

Before he was a libero, he was an
outside hitter and belbre that a soc

volleyball during his freshman

came apparent that I'alacios had
found a bidden talent.
And w hen it came down to Stan

He gave up soccer in favor of
volleyball and became one of the
Cardinal's top outside hitters for
the 1996, 1998 and 1999 seasons.
"Immediately he was one of our
best players and one of our most

Off the court, Palacios' contribu

guys are luck) enough to have that kind ol ef
fort put out foi their last match as well."
I hough bene lied most of the season while
recovering from shoulder surgery, I'alacios
was a vital contributor to the squad as the
onl\ senior. Quiet bv nature and unable to
lead the team on the- court. I'alacios was chal
lenged with the responsibility of helping
seven freshmen adjust to collegiate volley
ball.
"It was tough for me being out," I'alac ios
said. "1 fell like I didn't have much c redibili
ty. I hat's one of the reasons I rushed back.
()n Marc h less than four months after
surgery, I'alacios joined Stanford's lineup.
Despite limited range of motion in liis right
arm tli.it still prevents him from spiking or
serving, the senior took to the court as libero,
a defensive specialist position introduced to
men's collegiate volleyball this season.
"l.ven without full range of motion in his
right arm, he was one of our best defensive
players and passers." said head coach Ruben
Nieves. "Ii made a lot of sense for him to play
libero. It really showcased the strengths of
Josh's game, which are in the back row. It was
his saying grace; without ii he couldn't have

played very much this season."
Palacios competed in Stanford's final 1 1
matches of the season, including the upset
victory against No. 1 Long Beach State on Se
nior Night where he mate lied his career high
in digs with 17.
Palacios' teammates took note of his tri
umphant return to the court, and his dedica
tion to the program onlv increased the re
spect the\ had for their captain.
"Ife had a career-threatening injury and
worked realh hard to rehab and get back,"
said redshirt freshman Setli Ring. "He made
a huge contribution when other gins might
have just thrown in the towel."
It would have been easy for Palacios to
take his 1997 National Championship ring
and throw in the towel at the end of last sea
son. The shoulder surgery that kept him out
during his sophomore year hadn't ended his
shoulder problems and he continued to sut
ler from chronic shoulder dislocations
throughout his career.
But hist season when the team unexpect
edly lost tour of its top plavers and failed to
make the playoffs for the first time in 10
years, it just didn't seem like the right wax to
end.
"I didn't feel complete ending m\ career
not making the playoffs," Palacios said. "In
order for me to have closure to m\ volleyball
experience I felt like I had to come back and
guide the program to where it should be."
The downside of his return \v;is it meant
another shoulder surgery, but the upside
was that it also meant a season to pla\ on the
court with his brother (on, a sophomore who
had redsliirted the season before.
"[My brother was] one of the reasons that
1 wanted to come plav at Stanford." Jon Pala
cios said. "1 ahvavs watched him pl«i\ when I
w as younger, lie's been a great inspiration for
me and it's been a great experience playing
with him."
So this season when both Jon and Josh
starred in the Cardinal's comeback that fea
tured a near-upset against Pepperdine in
five games, Palacios deemed the match a
much better wav to mark the end of Ins Stan-

ford 'career
And looking back Palacios lias
built quite a legacy to leave behind.
Before he was a libero, he was an
outside hitter and belbre that a soc
cer player, l'alacios stumbled upon
volleyball during his freshman
year at Mira (losta High School,
and with his (>-"> frame, it soon be
came apparent that I'alacios had
found a bidden talent.
And w hen it came down to Stan
ford or Princeton lor college, the

Princ eton coach told Palacios that if
he was looking for a National
(.hampionship team, he should go
to StanlcjijcL So that's just what lie
did and two years later |hat's just
what he got.
He gave up soccer in favor of
volleyball and became one of the
Cardinal's top outside hitters for
the 1996, 1998 and 1999 seasons.
"Immediately he was one of our
best players and one of our most
poised players," Nieves said, "He
learned our system and we could
count on him to be at the light
place at the right time. I fe was pri
marily a strong passer and defen
sive player."

Off the court, Palacios' contribu
tions were just as great and this sea
son when the squad needed a
leader, Palacios was there.
"He brings a lot of experience
to the team," Jon Palacios said.
"He has been an inspiration to us
all year to want to play hard and
win because of all he's been
through."
"He's a very reliable person
and team member," Nieves said.
"He set a good example for the
younger players about how to be a
responsible Stanford athlete. As a
coach and team member, you're
real proud to c.ill him one of voui
own."
