## 
### MEGAN KNIZE DENNIS TYLER CONTRIBUTING WRITERS 
Yesterday, the ASSU Under
graduate Senate unanimously ap
proved the Flections Hearings
Committee's demerit recommen
dation for both presidential slates,
awarding no demerits to Ben Liu
,iihl Mike Dudas and 14 demerits
- the largest number of demerits
awarded during this election - to
Seth Newton and Malia Villegas.
Both slates are made up of juniors.
I lie senate also debated the va
lidii\ of the demerits system itself,
since it is part of the Campaign
Practices Code, which wasn't ap
proved by the Cradnate Student
Counc il and thus can't be used in
elections involving graduate vot
ers. If the CSC approves the de
merit c harges tonight, the demer
its will appear on the ballot for the
election tomorrow and Friday.
I he Senate approved the
Hearings Committee's recom
mendations on all charges, each of
which was explained in detail din -
ing Monday night's hearing. Ihe

Senate approved three demerits
against Newton and Villegas for
putting up a structure in White
Plaza that violated a University
policy. Four demerits were award-

Ed for an e-mail Newton sent on
April 19 claiming that an "in
formed source" told him the elec
tion was close. The Hearings
Committee found this an attempt
to unethically influence the elec
tion. Three demerits were award
ed for e-mails Senate Chair and
Platform for Accountability and
Change Campaign Manager
Steven Aronowitz, a senior, sent,
which the committee found violat
ed relevant University policy.
Four demerits were awarded for
an e-mail that encouraged sup
porters to send other e-mails. The
Hearings Committee found that
there was little attempt to make
the e-mail recipients aware of e

mail campaign i ules.
Liu and Hildas were exonerat
ed from charges thai emails from
supporters unethicalh influenced
the election.
"We led validated because we
know we ran a dean ( ampaign and
[the senate vole| proves this,' Liu
said.
Hildas added. "We intend to
i mi a clean campaign."
Newton could not be reached
fin (oininent, but \ illegas spoke
from lici room in Washington,
DC.
I his was a good catch l>\ the
112 ndei graduate Senate and all I lie
people involved," Villegas said,
"but we're still living to clarih
what came out at the meeting
tonight."
I learings ()|ficci Katie Young,
a junior, said, "I don't have auv

|x'i sÂ«>ii;il feelings .tlx>lll the out
< oiik'. I have complete liiith in the
I learings (loin mil ice's al)ilil\ lo he
fair."
Senaloi \ikki Love, a senior,
who led l he disc nssion and eventu
al senate approval of the demerit
violations, expressed concerns
about the ellccts of the growing
partisanship in presidential cam
paigns and in the senate. She said
all hut a few of'the ASS Is senators
have aligned themselves with ei
thct the "Students 112 irst platform
or the "Platform fin Ac rounlabilit\
and (lhaiige."
I Ins election lias heen the first
to use the demerit polic\ of pub
li< I\ noting violations instead of
fining candidates. According to
the Klcction Folic ies Appendix, the
Hearings (otninittee may recom
mend "public acknowledgment
that a i ampaign violation was com
mitted by a specified candidate,
slate or special fee request." A de
merit is inclic aled b\ a reel dot alter

tin 1 name of the candidate or slate.
According to Cracluate Senate
Chair Kaleb Midland, a master's
student in physics, " I lie problem
with the rules of the [Champaign
Practice (lode] is that ii was passed
by the Undergrad Senate and not
by the (iS( 1. In lad we did not even
receive the (IPC 1."
Aronowit/ insisted that "demer
its have no affect on the outcome of
the results," claiming that voters
don't pay attention to them. But
other senators wondered why the
demerits issue was not brought up
prior to last week's election.
According to ASSU Vice Presi
dent John Mills, a doctoral student
in genetics. Mills informally con
sulted with Constitutional Council
member I lan is Shapiro, a gradu
ate student in physics. Mills said
that Shapiro told him that the de
merits system was not legal. Rather
than starting a formal inquiry,
Mills and tlie ASSU Kxecutive
(lommittee held a meeting yester

day afternoon to crystallize the
elections rules.
I hey decided that if elections
violations occurred, the Heatings
(lommittee was to make recom
mendations that were to be for
warded to both the I ndcrgradii
ate Senate and the (>S( 1. I hev also
decided that il the senate chair was
affiliated with a political party,
someone not affiliated with either
part) should lead the proceeding.
I .ove presided over this portion
of last night's meeting, because
Senate Chair Aronowit/. is in
volved in the PAC campaign. I lie
Kxecutive (lommittee also decided
that "overriding a conviction bv
the I learings (lommittee requires
a 2/3 vote" of both I ndergraduate
Senate and CSC. finally, iliev de
cided that "punishment (disquali
fication or other penalty) will be
determined by each [Senate and
(;S( 4 legislative bodv."
" I his is trulv a miracle that all
the conflicting parties c ame to ihis

agreement today," Love said.
I he Senate also approved
spending limits of $60 dollars for
each slate's run-off election cam
paigning.
According to [ason Rang, a
(oterminal student in economics,
"validation means that the Senate
will critique" the fairness of the
Flections Committee in determin
ing the elected Senate."
Love explained that "we can't
have a run-oifuntil we validate; it's
just a formality."
A certification oft he spring gen
eral election vote will not take
place until next 1 uesday's meet
ing.
Ihe senators promised that
next week's debate will be lively.
"It is within our rights to bring
any valid information that we
have, whether it be on elections or
commissions," said Aronowitz.
Voting in the run-off will take
place tomorrow and Friday. Vote
