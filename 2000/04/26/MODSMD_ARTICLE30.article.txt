# In its fourth year, Eastside College Preparatory School meets its goal of sending its students to college
## Entire EPA prep school class gains acceptance to colleges 
### PETER STAIR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
All eight members of the first
graduating c lass of Kast l*alo Alto's
Eastside College Preparatory
School, which was founded by
Stanford alumni, received at least
one big envelope this year.
The class, consisting of entirely
scholarship students from East
Palo Alto, attracted oilers of college
admission from schools like the

California Polytechnic School,
Seton I fall, the Wharton School of
Business and Stanford.
1 his is a really big event, not
only for the students themselves,
bin lor the school and the commu
nity as a whole," said school
founder Chris Bischof, Class of
1992.
"Everything from day one has
been geared to get students . . .
ready to go to college," Bischof
said.

Bischof started the private
prepatory school four years ago
after recognizing the need tor a
high school located in East Palo
Alto, particularly one that encour
aged college aspirations.
" These kids, for the most part,
are the first generation of college
hound kids in their families. So,
they're breaking a cycle," said East
side college counselor Matt Mes
senger, Class of 1998.
"Their challenge is to go, survive
and hopefully thrive during their
first year of college," he said.
"We're confident they can."
Because of the school's mission,
students and administrators waited
nervously for the results of this first
year of college applications.
When Perpetua Alilijah received
the first acceptance phone call, she
said she was "kind of
stunned . . . People didn't really be
lieve in the school when it started."
For years after Ravenswood
High School was closed in 1976,
largely in response to judicial man
dates for desegregation, all high
school students in East Palo Alto
were bused to schools in the Se
quoia District. Such busing had a
detrimental effect on the commu
nity, Bischof said.
"We wanted to bring back a high
school to the community that
would prepare students to go onto

four year colleges," he said.
After receiving support from
combination of individuals, foun
dations and corporations - includ
ing free software from
Kmbark.com that facilitates c lions

ing and applying to colleges -
Bisc hoi 'made his it lea a reality with
only eight students, all freshman.
Since then, the school si/e has al
most doubled every year, from
eight to 20 to -i5 to 70. This year,

iht* school added a seventh and
eight grade and hopes to add a
sixth grade next year, bringing the
number of students to 85.
"Who knows where we'll be in
10 years," said Bischof.
