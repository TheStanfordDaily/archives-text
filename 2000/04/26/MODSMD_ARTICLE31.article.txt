The newly founded Stanford
Humanities Laboratory sent out
a formal call on April 10 for re

students and staff for the acade
mic year 2000-2001. Projects se

The Stanford Humanities
Laboratory, which has been
under discussion since spring
quarter 1999, is one ol the first
laboratories for the humanities
disciplines in the nation. Includ
ed in its main goals is ,i desire to
promote collaborative models ol
research in the humanities,
somewhat similar to the way that
research is conducted in the sci
ences.
French and Italian Prof. Jef
frey Schnapp, the director of the
Stanford Humanities Laborato
ry, was the initiator of this pro
ject.
"This is a pretty bold under
taking," Schnapp said. "I'm loc ik
ing forward to it. We're going to
have a lot of fun with this."
Traditionally, humanists have
predominately done both their
research and their writing in an
isolated environment and have
trained their undergraduate and
graduate students accordingly.
While this method allows for
much specialization in narrow
fields, iliis traditional research
environment has not been con
ducive to collaboration or disc us
sion amongst scholars.
The Stanford Humanities

laboratory will work to promote
Â«i more collaborative effort in hu
manities research.
"We will build on the special
ization, and allow specialists to
collaborate on big issues. 1 love
the traditional form of research
and this laboratory will not re
place it," Schnapp said.
"This will provide the oppor
tunity to have both kinds of re
search. 1 here is a different scope
voli can have with collaboration."
1 lie present call for research
proposals begins the first phase
of the laboratory founding. This
phase will last for two full years
and involve the seeding of three
to eight collaborative pilot pro
jects.
In spring quarter 2002, the
laboratory will issue a call for ap
plications for funds tor three to
five-year collaborative research
projects. This will mark the be
ginning of the second phase. At
this stage, the laboratory plans to
fund four to eight large-scale
projects on a yearly basis.
I lie President's Office and the
the School of Humanities and
Sciences Dean's Office have been
directi) involved in the planning
process for the laboratory. Much
of the funding for the projects
will be coining from the Presi
dent's ()Hice.
"It is highly probable that one
seed project will be from the
Presidential Symposia,"
Schnapp said.
