# Lewis denies environmental scarcity

### AMU GARG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In an event sponsored by the Stanford Ob
jectivist Club, McGee Hall was two-thirds
packed to hear Andre Lewis deliver a lecture
Monday night entitled "The Myth of Scarcity,"
arguing against the scarcity of natural re
sources.
Lewis asserted that "We are not destroying
the Earth . . . Running out of resources is a
complete myth."
Lewis earned a bachelor's degree in educa
tion from the University of Southern California,
and a post-graduate degree in philosophy from
the University of Sydney. He has published ar
ticles in the The Los Angeles limes and is also
host of the radio show, "The Andre Lewis
Show."
After his opening statement, described
several "doomsday predictions that failed," citing
the United Nation's 1969 report, a computer
model from 1972 and the World Watch Institute's
1990 report, "all of which gave mankind no more
than 70 years."
Lewis traced his argument to "the father of
scarcity," Reverend Thomas Malthus, who wrote
in his 1798 bcx>k, "On the Principles of Popula
tion," that human population grows taster than
resources. "But since Malthus's time, we see that
population has multiplied by five, and yet it feeds
itself better than 200 years ago," lie said.

For Lewis, the fundamental problem lies in
two arguments.
"First," said Lewis, "the literal shortage of
land has not happened. 1 here are vast amounts
of productive land that have barely been
touched. Imagine what would happen if man
started to plow these enormous, fertile tracts?"
"Second, and most important, man's ingenu
ity creates more resources, renewable and non-re
newable. In other words, by using resources in sci
ence and technology we can ac t ually create more
resources," he said.
Lewis qualified his argument by saying re
sources are not infinite, but that man's ingenu
ity c an create substitutes.
He gave examples of Japan, Russia and
Bangladesh, all of which have a similar number
of people. He argued, "it does not matter what
is the population but what type of population.
Japan is better off than Russia or Bangladesh
because it has <i productive, well-educated pop
ulation even though it is far behind in natural
resources. 1 he only system for the future is lais
sez-faire capitalism."
Lewis concluded by defining science and by
asserting that environmentalists have an "anti
man agenda."
"You are damn right," he said. "We have the
right to explore the Earth in order to ensure our
survival."

ranging from pollution in Pittsburgh to mail's

relation to nature. Many people said they dis
agreed with the speaker.
Senior Radhika Sarin, a cotenninal student
in Earth Systems, said, "I found a lot of holes in
his economic theory that explained his myth of
resource scarcity. I think he needs to brush up
011 his basic economics and understand there is
a serious case of market failure when it comes to
use of environmental goods and services."
Sarin also said she could "forgive the think
ing and logic," even though they were "annoy
ing." but could not excuse "his attitude and of
fensiveness."
"I lis language and arguments imply that he
is an imperialist, and he said himself that he
thinks certain cultures are more backwards
than others," she added.
Freshman Cireg VVuntyes said, "1 was im
pressed by the speaker's use of Socratic dia
logues and appreciated his soothing reassur
ances against the problem of scarcity. However,
I fear his position inav be unfounded words and
not truly reflect the state of Earth's fragile
ecosystem."
Sophomore Dan Zlatik said, "This man is a
nearsighted fool who exalts capitalism to un
godlv levels. 1 fe makes ridiculous presumptions
about what environmentalists stand for."
Zlatik added, "[Lewis] does not consider that
man's said ingenuity is also destroving endless
potential resources in the process... 1 lis insis
