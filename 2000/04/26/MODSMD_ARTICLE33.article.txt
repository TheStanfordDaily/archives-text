national soap opera."

wearing a lull length leather coat, one tall off the
platform chasing a cookie with a spatula and an
other li;is been criticized lor ,\ wardrobe 'drcm tiing
in earth tones,' " she said.
"Imagine a job interview in which yon get points
for knowing as little about the job as possible. That's
the presidential race this year."
Hill said she sees a large schism between what
voters want and what politicians are fighting over.
She explained that polls show people want better
education, a secure future for children and the el
derly, and financial security. Politicians, in contrast,
are still arguing about abortion, campaign finance
reform and smear campaigning, 1 till said.
Hill pointed out that the information industry is
a diverse network of news sources.
"As many people, if not more, receive their new s
from Rcdbook and |av Lent) us from C NN or I'liS.
We have to take this into account," she added.
(liven the variety of news sources available, "voters
can 110 longer be passive recipients of the news," she
said.
As Americans and as humans, Hill stated, "we are
paradoxically both skeptical and hopeful." I fill be
lieves there is hope for Washington, yet is skeptic al
that things will change anytime soon.
