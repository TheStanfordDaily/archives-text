# Hennessy's technological experience at MIPS link Stanford to Silicon Valley
## School Ties 
### JULIANA LIU STAFF WRITER 
When Provost John Hen
nessy takes over Staniord's top
spot this fall, he may be Stan
ford's first president to embody
the convergence of scholarship
and entreprenenrship.
During a sabbatical in the
early 1980s, Hennessy trans
formed a University research
project into MIPS Computer
Systems. MIPS, which is an
acronym for millions of instruc
tions per second, was renamed
MIPS Technologies. The com
pany is now publicly traded and
partially owned by Silicon
Graphics Inc.
MIPS has a $2.1- billion stock
market value, with $71 million
in sales last year, according to
The San Jose Mercury News. As
one of Silicon Valley's earlier
start-ups, MIPS has experi
enced the kind of longevity to
which many dot-coms now as
pire.
Many of I lennessy's business
associates have said that its suc
cess is due to I lennessy's leader
ship.
"One of John's greatest con
tributions to MIPS is establish
ing the culture of company, al
lowing people to believe in the
company themselves, to feel re
sponsibility for the company,"
said James Mac Hale, a director
of marketing at MIPS. "It's that
kind of culture that allows an or

ganization to have a long and
fruitful life instead of being just a
flash in the pan."
Many publications, including
The San Jose Mercury News
and Newsweek, believe I len
nessy's entrepreneurial experi
ence and ties to Silicon Valley's
elite could make Stanford the
university of the new economy.
"In the coming decade, Hen
nessy could turn sun-drenched
Stanford into the information
age's must influential breeding
ground," B.J. Sigesmund wrote
in Newsweek.
Startup dreams
The ideas that formed the
basis of MI PS's innovations were
actually developed in a research
project at Stanford, Hennessy
said.
At first, Hennessy and his
team had no intention of com
mercializing the technology.
"Only when we were coaxed
by a famous computer designer,
Gordon Bell, and saw that in
dustry was going to either ig
nore or be quite slow in adopt
ing the ideas, did we decide to
start MIPS and try to do it our
selves," I lennessy said.
In 1984, Hennessy took a
sabbatical to found the company
with Edward Stritter, now the
chairman of the Board of Clari
ty Wireless.
"I spent considerable time at
Stanford, since I still had an active
research group," Hennessy said.
"1 didn't teach, and I missed teach
ing very much."
I he dramatic shift from acide
mia to business taught I lennessy a
few lessons in administration.
"Probably the biggest benefits
[of the experience] are that I
learned ;i different range of lead
ership challenges and leadership
approaches," Hennessy said. "1
learned an appreciation tor the
business world that helps me talk
to people in business and disc uss
how universities work in compari
son."
MIPS history
I n 1991, MI PS c ame out with
R4()()0(tin), the tiisi commercial
(>4-bit mic i ((processor.
I he microprocessors based on
I lennessN's rescarc Ii help comput
er c hips to be faster .iikl more ctli
< ient.
Silicon (â–  rapllic s, lin . \v;is one
of Ml PS'customers. It specializes

in computers that can display
three-dimensional graphics, and ii
opted to buy MIPS out of concern
that the smaller company would
not have the financial resources to
stay in front in the chip-design
race, according to the San Francis
co (chronicle.
In March 1992, MIPS and SGI
announced a merger valued at
about $400 million, according to
the Financial Times.
MIPS sales tell as customers
questioned whether the company,
after the merger, would keep sup
plying chips on favorable terms,
according to the Chronicle. After
the announcement, MIPS report
ed disappointing first-quarter
earnings and its stock price fell
sharply.
Partly to reflect MIPS's poor
performance in the first quarter
and the dissolution of a computer
consortium that would have fur
thei promoted MIPS products,
SGI and MIPS renegotiated the
terms of the merger. SGI bought
MI PS for about S2OO million, half
the value of the original deal.
In 1998, MIPS made an initial
public offering of r>.r> million
shares. I lie- company's strategy is
lo locus on high-growth, high-vol
ume markets and (o continue to
build on iis strengths in traditional

embedded markets, according to
the MIPS Web site.
Back to the Farm
Perhaps more interesting than
the decision for a professor to
launch a startup is I iennessy's leap
from business back to academia in
the fall of 1985.
"I have always felt that people
should do what they love, especial
ly if they are good at it," Hennessy
said. "I love both teaching and re
search, and, for me, students are
the best part of teaching and re
search."
Hennessy resumed his work at
Stanford while continuing to col
laborate with MIPS and many
other technology firms. I ie said his
experience off the Farm has en
riched his teaching.
"It has certainly affected the
way I teach - especially in how I
relate principles and ideas to the
real world," Hennessy said. In re
search, it taught me team building
and motivational insights that are
helpful for leading larger research
projects."
Despite the successful foray into
the business world, Hennessy was
confident about his decision to
come back to Stanford.
Hennessy said he has no re
grets, "not this week, not ever.

"I have had the best of both ex
periences, and I am where I most
want to be," lit* said.
Valley ties
1 iennessy "understands Silicon
Valley from the inside and appre
ciates the complicated relation
ship between the University, the
high-tech business world and sur
rounding community," The Mer
cury News wrote in an April 4 edi
torial.
Many of the next president's
business associates agree, partly
because I iennessy has not only
been observing Silicon Valley's
takeoff but has also been an active
innovator in technology.
Hennessy "is the father of the
RISC microprocessor architec
ture," MIPS Director of Human
Resources Susan Raskin said.
RISC is the most popular mi
croprocessor in digital consumer
appliances and networking infra
structure systems, according to
Mac I iale.
"[Hennessy] lias ;i much bigger
view of what's going on | in the Val
ley] than iin> of us," MIPS's Direc
tor of Architecture Mike I'hlei
said.
Hennessy is c hief scientist ;it
MI PS and lias an honorary title of
co-founder, said MI I'S Vice-Presi

dent of Human Resources and Ad
ministration Rena Greager.
Mac Hale said Hennessy spends
half a day every week at MIPS and
lias his own cubicle there.
Hennessy also holds a board
seal at another company, 1 -span.
"Over time, 1 have had adviso
ry roles with a number of Valley
companies, but I now have only
these two. A provost's life is busy!"
Hennessy said.
Hut not too busy for significant
fundraising.
According to The Mercury
News, when Netscape co-founder
Jim Clark, who was on the faculty
with Hennessy in the early 1980s,
was considering a substantial do
nation to the university, Hennessy
sent him a gilt: a biography ol John
1). Rockefeller. The book includes
a section on Rockefeller's conver
sion to philanthropy after retiring
from Standard Oil.
Last year, Clark gave $150 mil
lion to the University's Bio-X pro
gram.
Although he has previously re
fused to say so, 1 lennessy admitted
that his long-standing friendship
with Clark influenced the contri
bution.
Hennessy the visionary
"He is very much a visionary,"

Raskin said. "He has a very Socrat
ic way with people, asking ques
tions that energize people's think
ing."
If Hennessy has his way, Stan
ford will take advantage of its
proximity to Silicon Valley to
strengthen ties to entrepreneur
ship.
"Clearly, technology plays a big
ger role now than in the past, and
1 hope my understanding can be
used to Stanford's advantage,"
Hennessy said.
"Similarly, I hope that we can
build on the relationships with the
Valley, both as firms and as indi
viduals."
Colleagues at MIPS praised
Hennessy's perspective and inter
personal skills, saying his years at
the firm have proven his leader
ship skills.l lennessy said one ol his
most important duties is to lead the
entire institution.
"This requires an appreciation
of everything we do, from the arts
and humanities to the Business
School to the social sciences to en
gineering, the sciences and the
Medical School," he said.
"As a problem solver, I am a
pragmatist, but university presi
dents are also leaders, and there 1
like to approach our challenges as
an optimist and a visionary."
