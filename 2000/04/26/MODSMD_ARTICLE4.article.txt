# Hennessy's technological experience at MIPS link Stanford to Silicon Valley
## School Ties 
### JULIANA LIU STAFF WRITER 
When Provost John Hen
nessy takes over Staniord's top
spot this fall, he may be Stan
ford's first president to embody
the convergence of scholarship
and entreprenenrship.
During a sabbatical in the
early 1980s, Hennessy trans
formed a University research
project into MIPS Computer
Systems. MIPS, which is an
acronym for millions of instruc
tions per second, was renamed
MIPS Technologies. The com
pany is now publicly traded and
partially owned by Silicon
Graphics Inc.
MIPS has a $2.1- billion stock
market value, with $71 million
in sales last year, according to
The San Jose Mercury News. As
one of Silicon Valley's earlier
start-ups, MIPS has experi
enced the kind of longevity to
which many dot-coms now as
pire.
Many of I lennessy's business
associates have said that its suc
cess is due to I lennessy's leader
ship.
"One of John's greatest con
tributions to MIPS is establish
ing the culture of company, al
lowing people to believe in the
company themselves, to feel re
sponsibility for the company,"
said James Mac Hale, a director
of marketing at MIPS. "It's that
kind of culture that allows an or

ganization to have a long and
fruitful life instead of being just a
flash in the pan."
Many publications, including
The San Jose Mercury News
and Newsweek, believe I len
nessy's entrepreneurial experi
ence and ties to Silicon Valley's
elite could make Stanford the
university of the new economy.
"In the coming decade, Hen
nessy could turn sun-drenched
Stanford into the information
age's must influential breeding
ground," B.J. Sigesmund wrote
in Newsweek.
Startup dreams
The ideas that formed the
basis of MI PS's innovations were
actually developed in a research
project at Stanford, Hennessy
said.
At first, Hennessy and his
team had no intention of com
mercializing the technology.
"Only when we were coaxed
by a famous computer designer,
Gordon Bell, and saw that in
dustry was going to either ig
nore or be quite slow in adopt
ing the ideas, did we decide to
start MIPS and try to do it our
selves," I lennessy said.
In 1984, Hennessy took a
sabbatical to found the company
with Edward Stritter, now the
chairman of the Board of Clari
ty Wireless.
