### AMY LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Nobel-prize winning poet Czeslaw Milosz and his
translator, former U.S. Poet Laureate Robert I lass,
addressed a full audience in Cubberley Auditorium
last night as they alternately read and commented on
Milos/'s recently translated long poem, " Treatise on
Poetry."
Milosz received the Nobel Prize in Literature in
1980 and is currently professor emeritus of Slavic
Languages and Literature at UCI-Herkeley.
I lass is a professor of English at UC-Berkeley who
has translated many of Milos/'s works in conjunction
with the author.
Before the reading, Milosz spoke ol the profound
influence that translation has had on his poetry, and
on his role as a poet.
1 fe said, "I consider it to be a great privilege to be
in America, to exist, to communicate to America,
thanks to these translations."
Milosz considers the poem an "ellbrt to be free
enough not to write very condensed poems . . . but to
talk about various historical problems in a kind of
verse."
"It is actually a treatise on history," he said. "I listo
ry has much to do with poetry."
Though born in Lithuania, Milosz grew up in
Poland where, during World War II and the years
following, he experienced much of the political tur
moil and ideological repression enforced upon
Poland by Nazi and Soviet regimes.
Written between 1 ( .)r). r ) to 195() while Milosz lived in
political exile in France, "Treatise on Poetry" delin
eates, in four parts, the history ol Poland's social con
dition and poetical transformation during the first
half of the twentieth century.
Mass said that he had long wished to translate the
poem, but that, "[Milosz] felt for many years that it
was just too Polish for many American audiences."
"1 am captivated by [the poem's] immense range
and the way it speaks to the history of this century,"
said I lass.
The reading, which was primarily done in English

by Mass, was interspersed with the two poets' coin
men tar) on the dillit tilt choices thev made dining
translation as well as the various historical contexts of
the poem.
In answer to how he dec ides which ol his poems to
translate, Milosz said simply, "I translate those poems
which I like and which I can translate."
Robert Kaufman, professor ol Knglish, and Adam
Casdin, doctoral student in l-.nglish, introduced the
two poets.
"Translation is a kind of gift, not simply a render
ing or an homage, but a process of bringing to life,"
(Hasdin said.
I'he event was sponsored by the Stanford I luinan
ities Center's Poetry and Translation Workshop and
the Department of Knglish.
