### MEGAN KNIZE STAFF WRITER 
The senate's meeting to certify
the election results next Tuesday
will be far from a rubber stamp.
Among tht- issues up for discus
sion will be the contestion by sena
tors from Students First senators
against the newly-elected senators
affiliated with the Platform for Ac
countability and Change.
The senate will also vote on
whether to eliminate the quorum
requirement for special fees. At last
night's senate meeting, senior
Thomas Soule presented a propos
al to "rectify an unnecessary Con
stitutional provision that caused
the Graduate Women's Network
special fee to fail.
Soule noted that the special fee
was "31 votes short of the critical
mass" needed to grant a majorit\ -
and thus approve the fee. Soule
proposes to eliminate .1 required
minimum voter turnout.
Fhe senate will also hear argu
ments for the first time from three
former senate candidates affiliated
with Students First contesting the
"egregious malpractices that took
place by candidates belonging to
PAC in last week's elections." ac
cording to a press release released
yesterda\ by the Students First sen
atorial candidates.
None of the students who wrote
the press release were elected to the
OHM it.il I IIA / nw I 1
dates, Jordan Connors, Rajaie Bat
niji and Sunaina Sinha, all fresh
men, said their intention is to "pre
serve the integrity of the ASSU and
its elections process."
In the press release, they said
they knew of seven instances
when PAC candidates and their
supporters "deliberately and
maliciously broke rules." Fur
thermore, they say they believe
the candidates affiliated with
PAC should be disqualified, be
cause the demerits awarded to
Newton and Villegas "during
and after the elections" were not
extended to PAC's seven senate
candidates.
They added that the accusa
tions, which involve "flagrantly ille
gal flyering to the notorious e-mail
party in which hundreds of unso
licited e-mails were sent out," were
corroborated by witnesses.
"Other candidates who ran a
fair campaign did not send out ille
gal e-mails and did not place pro
hibited material in White Plaza,"
the press release said.
The students who wrote the
press release also said the "PAC
enate candidates have an unfair
advantage that needs to be recti
fied" and encouraged the present
Undergraduate Senate to "set a
strong precedent that cheating will
not be rewarded."
