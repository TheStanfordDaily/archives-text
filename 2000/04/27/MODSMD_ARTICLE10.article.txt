LA. police falsely accuse
suspects of having cocaine
LOS ANGELES (AP) — DNA tests have contradicted
the testimony of police officers in six cases where they
claimed to witness rock cocaine being spit from suspects'
mouths, the Los Angeles limes reported today.
The arrests were made in the department's Rampart,
Southwest and Hollenbeck stations, bolstering allega
tions of widespread corruption within the Los Angeles
Police Department.
Investigators believe the reports about drugs hidden
in suspects' mouths were concocted to make unjustified
arrests, sources close to an ongoing corruption probe told
the newspaper.
The corruption investigation centers on a group of
rogue anti-gang officers who framed, beat and sometimes
shot innocent people.
Four of six questionable drug cases involved Officers
David Vinton and Scott Voeltz, who were assigned to the
Rampart station.
An internal LAI'I) disciplinary board found the offi
cers had made "an honest mistake" and both were issued
written reprimands.
Four similar drug arrests made by the officers were
also later overturned.
Former Panther wins suit
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Former Black Panther Elmer
"Geronimo" Pratt, imprisoned for 25 years for a murder
he says never committed, settled a lawsuit against the c ity
and FBI for $4.5 million, the Los Angeles limes report
ed today.
The Times, quoting sources it said were familiar with
the negotiations, reported the c ity's share, which must In
approved by the Gity Council, at $2.75 million. 1 he FBI
will pay $1.75 million to settle the lawsuit alleging false
imprisonment and civil rights violations, the newspaper
said.
"It's a fair deal for everybody," Pratt attorney Johnnie
L. Cochran Jr. said Tuesday.
Pratt, 53, was convicted in 1972 of robbing and fatally
shooting schoolteacher Caroline Olsen on a Santa Moni
ca tennis court.
He said he was in Oakland for Black Panther meetings
at the time and that FBI agents and police hid and possi
bly destroyed wiretap evidence that would have exoner
ated him.
Fhe decorated Vietnam War veteran had maintained
from the beginning that he was innocent.
His lawyers blamed his arrest on a politically charged
campaign by J. Edgar Hoover's FBI against the Black
Panthers and other perceived enemies of the U.S. gov
ernment.

Breaking the bank at UCLA
The University of California at Los Angeles has col
lected $ 1.2-billion in its continuing capital campaign, a
record sum for a single campus of a public university.
UCLA is now increasing its goal to $ 1.6 billion, the most
ambitious ever for a public institution.
Announced in 1997, the drive is scheduled to run
through June 2002. University officials said the fast pace
toward meeting the university's original $1.2 billion goal
had been driven, in part, by 37 gifts of $5 million or more.
At least 23 institutions around the country have an
nounced capital campaigns of $ I billion or more, includ
ing nine public institutions. File University of Michigan,
raising money for three campuses, brought in $ 1.4 billion
during a campaign that ended in 1997.
Only five" institutions, all private, have raised totals of
$1.5 billion or more: Columbia University, Cornell Uni
versity, Harvard University, the University of Southern
California and Yale University.
