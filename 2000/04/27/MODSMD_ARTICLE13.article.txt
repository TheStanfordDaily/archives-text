Apparently, Alpha Sig has always had a
sense of'humor. Over 40 years ago, the D;iily
wrote, "The Communist May Day will be the
theme of the Alpha Sigma Phi costume
dance ... The Commie May Day Dance re
places the annual all-campus Dude Ranch
Dance that the Alpha Sigs annually sponsor.
According to Bob Cathcart, social chairman,
the funnier the costumes the better. A few

suggestions are com-

missar, peasant,

hero, hero medal,

or red herring."
The Bottom Line:

Who needs Ex-

otic
Erotic?
