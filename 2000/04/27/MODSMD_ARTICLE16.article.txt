## The 						Supreme Court hears Boy Scout Case 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —
Supreme Court justices struggled
yesterday over whether to let the
Boy Scouts bar homosexuals from
serving as troop leaders and role
models in an organization that
teaches its members to be "moral
ly straight."
Without saying how they will
ultimately vote, several justices
voiced skepticism about how tar
the court could possibly go to force
open admissions upon a private
organizations.
"In your view, a Catholic orga
nization has to admit Jews" and "a
Jewish organization has to admit
Catholics," Justice Stephen G.
Breyer told Evan Wolfson, the
lawyer for James Dale of New Jer
sey, a former assistant scoutmaster
ousted when the organization
learned he is gay. Dale subse
quently filed suit against the
Scouts.
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor
and David H. Souter followed
Breyer's line of questioning, ask
ing Wolfson whether his argu
ment meant the Scouts could be
required to admit girls.
Justice Antonin Scalia voiced
his reservations another way.
"They think that homosexuali
ty is immoral," he said, asking why
the Scouts must accept as a leader
"someone who embodies a contra
diction of their message?"
Founded in 1910, the Scouts
have an oath and law that long
have required members to
promise to be "clean" and "moral
ly straight."
But no written rule specifically
addresses homosexuality.
Wolfson said the Scouts are not
primarily an "anti-gay organiza
tion" and therefore Dale's pres
ence did not burden the group's
message.
Dale did not seek to use his
leadership position to advocate

homosexuality, Wolfson added.
New Jersey's highest court
ruled that the Boy Scouts' ban on
gay troop leaders violated a state
prohibition on discrimination in
public accommodations. But the
Scouts say the state law violates the
organization's rights of free speech
and free association under the
Constitution's First Amendment.
Some justices also had pointed
questions for the Scouts' lawyer,
George Davidson.
Justice John Paul Stevens asked
whether a homosexual could be
excluded if he did not publicly
declare his sexual orientation but
that it was discovered against his
wishes.
Yes, said Davidson, arguing
that the organization had a right
"to choose the moral leaders for
the children in the program."
"Boy Scouting is so closely iden
tified with traditional moral values
that the phrase, 'He's a real Boy
Scout,' has entered the language,"
Davidson said. The Scouts believe
homosexuality does not fit that
moral code, he said.
Souter told Davidson, "Mr.
Dale is not asking to carry a ban
ner. He's saying, 'I'm not going to
carry a banner.'"
Dale and his parents attended
the argument, and he spoke after
ward to reporters.
"I have always loved the Boy
Scouts of America,"he said. "It's a
program that I hold dear to my
heart, and I hope to one day be
able to be back in the program."
Being morally straight means
"standing up for yourself and
being honest," he added.
Yesterday's argument was the
last for the court's current term,
and the justices are expected to
decide by July whether the Scouts
had the right to revoke Dale's role
as a troop leader.
Dale was 19 and an assistant

scoutmaster of a Matawan, N.J.,
troop when in 1990 he was identi
fied in ;i newspaper article as co
president of a campus lesbian and
gay student group at Rutgers I tii
versity.
The Scouts' Monmouth Coun
cil revoked Dale's registration as
an adult leader, telling him the
organization does not allow open
ly gay members.
Dale sued, contending the
Scouts violated New Jersey's anti
discrimination law.
Scalia told Wolfson that if the
court ruled in favor of his argil

ment that gays cannot he banned
because the Scouts' overall mes
sage is not anti-homosexual, it
may "induce them to become
more openlv and avowedly
opposed to homosexual conduct.'"
Wolfson said the Scouts may
not want to do so because they
could lose some heterosexuals
who would not support an anti
gay policy.
(living public accommodations
broacl freedom to exclude people
the organization believes do not
match its message could "swallow
the civil rights laws," Wolfson said.
