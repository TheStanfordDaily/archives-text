# Authorities release Columbine tapes

GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) — Large
p<x)ls of blood soak into beige car
pet, marked by yellow paper cards
bearing victims' names. Calculators
and pencils lie next to open books
on tables. A computer monitor sits
blown to bits.
To the horror of Columbine vic
tims' families, authorities released
videotapes yesterday that offer the
public the first glimpse of the high
school's library at least a day after
two students killed 12 schoolmates
and a teacher before committing
suicide on April 20, 1999. Ten of
those students and the gunmen
died in the library.
Authorities charged $25 for
each tape.
The nearly three-hour tape,
part of it set eerily to a pop music
soundtrack that was added when it
was turned into a training video,
was mostly shot by firefighters. It
also includes aerial f<x>tage taken by
TV news teams that showed
wounded and two slain students
outside Columbine.
"For the first time today, I saw
my daughter being dragged over
to the fire engine. 1 don't need to
see that and nobody else needs to
see that," said Beth Nimmo, moth
er of slain student Rachel Scott.
"It's something you'd see on a
gory music video," said Nimmo,
her voice choked with anguish.
"It hurts. They have pictures
from the helicopter of dragging
Richard by his feet," said Connie
Michalik, whose son, Richard
Castaldo, was shot outside the
school and paralyzed.
Jefferson County Attorney
Frank Hutfless released the video
tapes to the victims' families Tues

day to comply with a court order.
He said he then released them to
anyone who asked for them "to
avoid additional lawsuits by the
public or news media."
With Sarah McLachlan's "I Will
Remember You" playing in the
background, the video, taken by
firefighters, enters the library
through open doors, Hanked by
windows that had been shattered
by gunfire.
It shows books pulled to the
floor. Chairs are askew, as if pushed
out of the way hurriedly. Bullets
have shattered windows and punc
tured walls. A window blind is still
jumbled from a student's hurried
escape.
The p(x)ls of blood on desks and
on the earth-tone carpeted fl<x)r
capture the eye. Folded yellow
cards are carefully placed near the
stains to mark the names of victims.
Numbered cards mark pieces of
evidence.
"Each one of those pools of
blood is where someone's child
died or was seriously wounded,"
said attorney James Rouse, who
represents some victims' families.
The video does not show bodies
inside the school. It has scenes of
the cafeteria, which was heavily
damaged by gunfire and bombs,
but it does not include the surveil
lance fixjtage from a cafeteria cam
era that was broadcast on some
news programs last fall.
The gruesome images are inter
twined with typical school details —
trophy cases, desks lined iu rows in
classrooms, a neon light blinking
messages about report cards and
wishing spring sports teams
"good luck."
