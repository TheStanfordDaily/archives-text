# Panel finds math books ineffective

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Why
can't the kids learn algebra?
Because the books they use don't
explain how algebra calculations
will relate to everyday life, a panel
of scientists said yesterday.
But they could.
"Just figuring out how to drive
a truck route using the least
amount of gas is a mathematical
problem," said George Nelson,
director of the American Associa
tion lor tlit* Advancement of Sci
ence's long-term math and sci
ence education campaign.
" That's very important to compa
nies now. They count every
ounce."
Students are increasingly
being required to take advanced
math, whether they go to college,
said the science group, which cre
ated a review panel of mathemati
cians and college and k-12 math
teachers.
Yesterday the group displayed
a dozen inch-thick textbooks pep
pered with equations, graphs and
word problems. Researchers
called on schools choosing the
materials to concentrate more on
how algebra is taught.
1 lie 12 books studied by the
group represent the most widely
used of about two-dozen algebra
books published, affecting mil
lions of children in grades six
through 12.
No books were considered
excellent. Seven of the 12 were
deemed adequate. Five — includ
ing the three most widely used in
American classrooms — were
rated so inadequate that they lack
potential for student learning.
Book publishers yesterday
defended their work, blaming the
demand driven by the math stan
dards set by states.
"Educational publishers are
often caught on the horns of a
dilemma," said Stephen Driesler,

executive director of the school
division of the Association of
American Publishers Inc. "It is
the teachers and local school offi
cials who decide which textbooks
meet their needs."
Schools, reviewers said, tend to
choose books from the biggest
publishers, with the time and
money to tie their materials to
what state lawmakers think pupils
should know about algebra and
market these books aggressively.
"Millions of dollars are spent
on textbooks; we need more
guidance," said Jacqueline
Mitchell, Maine's state supervisor
of math instruction. "School dis
tricts just don't have the exper
tise, time and money to do this
type of analysis."
Newer programs address how
algebra — which explains how
different numbers relate to each
other — helps people accomplish
tasks, such as balancing check
books, figuring out which phone
company rates are best, and cal
culating mileage, said one text
book writer.
"We're not drilling kids,"
Sherry Fraser, director of the
Interactive Mathematics Pro
gram, a textbook deemed ade
quate by the group and used by
500 schools in 28 states. "If they
are just mimicking the teacher,
they do not see the usefulness of
it."
But the books also do a p(x>r
job of helping teachers build on
what children already under
stand or dealing with children's
misconceptions, said Gerald
Kulm, a Texas A&M University
math professor who directed the
evaluation.
For example, the lesson review
section of one book simply asks
students to list and define vocabu
lary words like "scatter plot" and
"linear equation."
