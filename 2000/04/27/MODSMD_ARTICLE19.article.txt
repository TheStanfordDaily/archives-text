# Psychiatrist says that Elian appears happy
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — A child psychia
trist who interviewed Elian Gonzalez for the
government recommended yesterday
against a visit by his Miami relatives "in their
current angry state." And the 6-year-old
Cuban boy's father asked a federal court to
allow him alone to speak for his son.
As Elian remained secluded in rural Mary
land with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
stepmother and half brother, Dr. Paulina E
Kernberg of Cornell University Medical Col
lege reported that Elian has had "a positive
reunion with his father" and displays a
"sense of well-being and happiness with 11 is
father."
Noting the anger expressed by the Miami
relatives over the raid that took Elian from
them Satin clay, Kernberg said, "In that frame
of mind, they would likelv be disruptive for
the child, who demands a quiet period of
emotional healing from the last few weeks of
stress."
She recommended the Miami relatives
seek counseling "to aid them in accepting and
supporting Elian's reunion with his father."
The boy would benefit for now from receiv
ing letters, photos and taped messages front
them, Kernberg said.
Meantime, Gregory Craig, attorney for
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, asked in an emergen
cy petition for the 11th I ,S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta "to assert his rights as a
father . . . to speak on behalf of Elian, who has
no other suitable representative."
The father asked the court to reject a bid
by the boy's great-uncle and former tempo
rary guardian, Ea/aro Gonzalez, to have his
lawyers and doctors see Elian and speak for
him before the court.
"Lawyers for Ea/aro Gonzalez — and they
are Eazaro's law yers, not Elian's — seek to use
machination and legal sleight of hand to turn
this court into the arbiter of an intra-family
dispute," the Craig brief said. "This case cries
out for this father's personal intervention to
save his son from further manipulation."
I he Justice Department also filed its oppo
sition to Eazaro's motion for a court-appoint

ed guardian to examine and speak for Elian.
It pledged to provide the court with regular
reports from a psychiatrist and a social work
er it has hired to monitor Elian.
I lie 1 1 tb Circuit is considering the Miami
relatives' appeal of a I .S. district court deci
sion that threw out the political asylum peti
tion tlicv filed on Elian's behalf.
On Capitol Hill. Ea/aro Gonzalez and his
daughter. Marislevsis, and other Miami rela
tives campaigned to keep the boy in this
country despite his hither s desire to take him
home to (luba.
Kernberg, fluent in Spanish, spent 2 1/2
hours luesda\ with the Gonzalez family at
Andrews Air Force Base just before they went
to tlicit new retreat at the Wye River Planta
tion on Mankind's Eastern Shore. She spent
time alone with the father and with the entire
family.
Although Marisleysis Gonzalez has charac

terized her relationship to Elian as that of a
surrogate mother, Kernberg said Elian may
have a schoolboy crush on her. Elian confid
ed to his stepmother that he has a secret love,
Mary, Kernberg said in a declaration the Jus
tice Department supplied the 1 ltli Circuit.
'His feelings for Marisleysis are similar to
the romantic feelings of a school boy for his
teacher or a wished-fbr girlfriend," Kernberg
wrote.
The child psychiatrist gave Elian plastic
soldiers, similar in appearance to the Border
Patrol agents who removed him in from the
Miami home, to gauge whether the raid left
lasting damage.
The boy played with the toy soldiers "with
pleasure and without anxiety," Kernberg
wrote. "His removal from his Miami relatives'
home, although clearly startling and frighten
ing, was in all likelihood not a traumatic expe
rience producing lasting effects."
