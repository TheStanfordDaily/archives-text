"The role of the press is to afflict the comfortable
and to comfort the afflicted," said Helen Thomas,
dean of the White House press corps, to a crowd of
150 at Kresge Auditorium on Wednesday night.
Thomas, a wire reporter and self-proclaimed "tor
turer of presidents" who delivers the final "Thank
you, Mr. President" at White House press confer
ences, was the first female president of the White
House Correspondents Association and the first
woman member of the National Press Club. She has
covered the eight presidents since 1961 — Kennedy
to Clinton.
Thomas focused on the role of the press in the po
litical process, bringing her years of experience to

bear on current events. She highlighted the adminis
trations she lias covered, including President Clin
ton's, noting each president's accomplishments and
failures.
Thomas said, "1 report on presidents not as kings,
but as human beings, however condescending that
may sound."
Thomas was unapologetic about coverage of re
cent events including the Monica Lewinsky allair.
"The Oval Office is hallowed ground," she said,
"and we, the press, are its self-anointed watchdogs."
Thomas argued for the maximum accountabilit)
of presidents to the people, and scoffed at their com
plaints of losing privacy.

den," she said. "1 never waste my
sympathy on presidents." A few
moments later, she declared that
the Monica Lewinsky scandal
made her want to go on a Weight
Watchers diet.
Lewinsky recently became a
spokeswoman for the Jenny Craig
weight loss program.
To balance her unflattering
portrayal of chief executives,
Thomas quoted former presidents
criticizing herself and the press.
President Gerald Ford alleged
ly quipped, "If Clod created the
earth in six days, he couldn't have
rested on the seventh day. He
would have had to explain it to
Helen Thomas."

Gen. Colin Powell, when ap
proached by Thomas at a cocktail
party concerning his reported
nomination to the office of Secre
tary of State, purportedly said,
"Isn't there some war we can send
her to?"
President John F. Kennedy,
when asked by a reporter on Air
Force One what would happen if
the plane went down, replied "I
don't know, but your name will be
just a footnote."
In spite of the constant malign
ing of the press by public officials,
Thomas said she feels privileged to
have "a ringside seat to instant his
tory" as a reporter on the White
House beat.
In the question-and-answer ses
sion after the speech, Thomas sur
prised the audience by remarking
"I don't think of myself as a
woman. Firstly, 1 am a human

being, and secondly, a reporter."
However, Thomas did lament
the absence of women in the polit
ical arena, especially the current
presidential campaign. "Where
are the women in this campaign?
Nowhere. Their silence has been
deafening."
She noted that although
women have made strides in many
areas, "there are many more
mountains to climb towards equal
ly"
The speech, entitled "Dateline
Washington,"was sponsored by
the ASSU Speakers Bureau in con
junction with Herstory, a student
organized celebration of women
and their contributions to society.
Thomas, listed by the World Al
manac as one of the 25 Most Influ
ential Women in America, was the
keynote speaker for two-week cel
ebration.
