## The 						Stanford Daily Hennessy's recent comments raise concern

WITH UNIVERSITY PROVOST
John Hennessy's recent appoint
ment to the post of University
president, many, foremost among
them students, expressed feelings that a new
era of candidness and open dialogue between
students, faculty and administration on major
issues had dawned.
However, despite Hennessy's candid speech
at the press conference April 4 announcing his
appointment, his more recent interview in the
Aril 18th issue of the Daily ("Hennessy reflects
on upcoming challenges") seems to indicate
that Hennessy has all too quickly begun the
transition from a provost with a professor's
concern for students to a politically correct and
characteristically vague University president in

the making.
Perhaps most surprising in Hennessy's
comments last week was his statement con
cerning the matter of discrimination against
female faculty that, " The best thing .... [is] to
see if we can move the debate back into the
institution." He added that matters like the
recent verdict awarding damages to former
Medical Center researcher Colleen Crangle
"polarize" the issue," and that, "[We need to]
continue the process we've been on [by] reach
ing out to underrepresented communities...
and being opportunistic." Finally, Hennessy
asserted that the "overwhelming" issues are
"balance of family, biological clock[s] and
tenure."
Not only did these comments stand in stark

contrast to Hennessy's statements on April 4,
when he repeated that Stanford has a zero tol
erance policy for discrimination and retalia
tion, they also seem to reflect a profound dis
regard for those who have already expressed a
complete lack of faith in the internal process.
Hennessy's language has moved from being
clear and precise to maintaining a condition at
the University that has already proven itself
ineffective.
Furthermore, Hennessy's reference to "bio
logical clock[s]" and the "overwhelming" issues
facing female faculty ignore the issue of dis
crimination brought forth by female faculty,
seeming instead to suggest that the situation
has simply "become more stressful than in the
past." The stress of the modern mother, how-

ever, is hardly the issue at hand — rather it is
the matter of discrimination against female
faculty that should be of most concern to Hen
nessy if he wishes to take the University to a
new level of indisputably fair hiring and pro
motion practices during his tenure as Univer
sity president.
Hennessy's discussion of student voice
raised equally serious concerns. Last week,
Hennessy stated that if the student communi
ty were to, "say, 'Here are our top two or three
issues, can we focus on these?' " he feels that
students would achieve better results. Clearly,
Hennessy recognizes the diversity of student
interests and, having spent many years as a

professor, interacting with students on
a daily basis, Ik* should also be aware of
how a nar■rowing-down of issues would
inevitably marginalize many important
student communities.
r.very major student community at
Stanford, whether they are ethnic,
activist, or otherwise, lias a unique and
important set of issues it needs
addressed by the University at any
given time. Thus, for I lennessy to sug
gest that all these communities get
together to pick a few important issues

simply moves the onus of responding
to all issues from the University's
shoulders to those of the students —
asserting namely that the responsibility
lies with the students in deciding which
few issues are worthy of the Universi
ty's attention. Such tactics are unfair
and would only serve to divide the stu
dent body as a whole, while marginal
izing individual student communities
and leaving the University largely
without fault.
Lastly, 1 lennessy commented on the
importance of undergraduate educa
tion, saying, "When we think about the
Stanford undergraduate education,
| it's] the notion of the whole person ...
On the Hip side, technology is

inescapable." Hennessy went on to
speak on the merits of technology and
the need for humanities majors to be
proficient in the use of many different
technologies.
Though no one would argue the
validity of Hennessy's point, some
would no doubt note that Hennessy
has changed his position from his com
ments on April 4, when he cited
strength in the arts and humanities as
one of Stanford's three main foci in the
coming years. Hennessy has moved
from stressing the importance of
developing Stanford's undergraduate
programs in the humanities and social
sciences to emphasizing the degree to
which such "fuzzv" students need tech

nology as a part of their education.
Not only does this effectively side
step the issue of the often lamented
state of University support for under
graduate programs in the humanities
and social sciences, it also reinforces
the increasingly apparent sentiment
that Stanford will continue to move in
a decidedly "tecliie" direction, neglect
ing, to a large extent, its many human
ities and social science students.
Hennessy's comments about these
three major areas — discrimination,
student voice and the need for devel
opment in the arts and humanities —
seem to indicate an intention to keep
the University on largely the same path
it has been on. Though that path has

been a generally positive one, serious
concerns have been raised, particular
ly in those areas discussed by Hen
nessy. This suggests in no uncertain
terms that these areas are ones where
the University simply cannot continue
on its current trajectory.
Hennessy, in his initial press confer
ence on April 4, gave many people at
the University a reason to hope for
change. However, his more recent
comments raise more than a small
degree of concern.
It's time for the future president to
stii k to his guns and change the dan
gerous trajectory in these problem
areas that has gotten to this position in
the first place.
