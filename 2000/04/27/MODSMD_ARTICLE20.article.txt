WITH UNIVERSITY PROVOST
John Hennessy's recent appoint
ment to the post of University
president, many, foremost among
them students, expressed feelings that a new
era of candidness and open dialogue between
students, faculty and administration on major
issues had dawned.
However, despite Hennessy's candid speech
at the press conference April 4 announcing his
appointment, his more recent interview in the
Aril 18th issue of the Daily ("Hennessy reflects
on upcoming challenges") seems to indicate
that Hennessy has all too quickly begun the
transition from a provost with a professor's
concern for students to a politically correct and
characteristically vague University president in

the making.
Perhaps most surprising in Hennessy's
comments last week was his statement con
cerning the matter of discrimination against
female faculty that, " The best thing .... [is] to
see if we can move the debate back into the
institution." He added that matters like the
recent verdict awarding damages to former
Medical Center researcher Colleen Crangle
"polarize" the issue," and that, "[We need to]
continue the process we've been on [by] reach
ing out to underrepresented communities...
and being opportunistic." Finally, Hennessy
asserted that the "overwhelming" issues are
"balance of family, biological clock[s] and
tenure."
Not only did these comments stand in stark

contrast to Hennessy's statements on April 4,
when he repeated that Stanford has a zero tol
erance policy for discrimination and retalia
tion, they also seem to reflect a profound dis
regard for those who have already expressed a
complete lack of faith in the internal process.
Hennessy's language has moved from being
clear and precise to maintaining a condition at
the University that has already proven itself
ineffective.
Furthermore, Hennessy's reference to "bio
logical clock[s]" and the "overwhelming" issues
facing female faculty ignore the issue of dis
crimination brought forth by female faculty,
seeming instead to suggest that the situation
has simply "become more stressful than in the
past." The stress of the modern mother, how-

ever, is hardly the issue at hand â€” rather it is
the matter of discrimination against female
faculty that should be of most concern to Hen
nessy if he wishes to take the University to a
new level of indisputably fair hiring and pro
motion practices during his tenure as Univer
sity president.
Hennessy's discussion of student voice
raised equally serious concerns. Last week,
Hennessy stated that if the student communi
ty were to, "say, 'Here are our top two or three
issues, can we focus on these?' " he feels that
students would achieve better results. Clearly,
Hennessy recognizes the diversity of student
interests and, having spent many years as a
