# MODERN LIFE IS RUBBISH
## Media out of control

Turning tragedy into merchan
dise: what could be more
American? To the horror of
just about everyone involved,
die sheriffs department in Jefferson
County, Colorado announced yesterday
that a 30-minute video of the
Columbine High School shootings is
now available to the public. The tapes
go for $25 each and contain footage
taken from surveillance and helicopter

cameras, as well as
background pop
music.
According to coun
ty officials, the tape is
actually meant to be a
training video.
A spokeswoman for
the Littleton Fire
Department explains,
"In the unfortunate

event that another
school shooting does take place, the Lit
tleton Fire Department believes that it
has provided a valuable service to edu
cate other public safety officials."
It's difficult to imagine what sort of
training could be extracted from the
footage, which apparently consists of
students scattering from gunfire, the
bloodstained library, bullet-riddled
classrooms and helicopters lifting out
the dead and dying. And there seems to
be no purpose at all for the background
music, which includes folk artist Cheryl
Wheeler sententiously crooning:
"Maybe it's the movies, maybe it's the
books, maybe it's the bullets ... if it
were up to me, I'd take away the guns."
Theoretically, the song might have
been added in an attempt at emotional
closure, though it didn't work very well;
most of the victims' families turned off
the audio during their court-ordered
preview of the tape. But closure of some
sort is what Littleton badly needs.
The media has a disturbing trait of
seizing on an isolated incident and mak
ing it into easily digestible synecdoche
for complex issues.
Case in point: the unfortunate Cuban
boy who, through no fault of his own,
has supplanted Macaulay Culkin as
America's favorite child star.
What better way to cut through the
nightmarish tangle of Cuban-American
relations than to point to a photo of
those puppy-dog eyes and say "It's all
for the child?" This works no matter
which side of the issue you're arguing
and neatly circumvents the problem
that we wouldn't have these photos if
Elian hadn't spent the last five months
dogged by camera crews, hunting out
that perfect slice of tragedy with a

human face.
The months after the Columbine
shooting saw the same process out in
full force; anyone with any sort of agen
da jumped on the massacre as an
opportunity to grind his or her person
al ax. Suburban parents are neglectful.
The Web is a bastion of neo-Nazism.
Marilyn Manson teaches our kids to kill.
And on and on.
The recent one-year anniversary of
the shooting has sparked a resur
gence; A 1 Core used it last week to
attack Ceorge W. Bush for being soft
on gun control, while President Clin
ton visited Colorado with a similar
agenda and was met with anti-gun
control protests.
Both sides used the same arguments
as always: Core announced that "it's
time to get guns away from the people
who should not have them," while one
of the Colorado protesters countered,
"In this society, everyone needs to be
armed. Those teachers should have
been armed in Columbine."
None of this is very new or very
helpful. And as the more astute have
noted, continually bringing the mas
sacre back into the public eye has the
side effect of giving the two teenage
gunmen the exact historical immortal
ity that they wanted.
Meanwhile, the victims' families say
that for the most part, they just want to
be left alone — though this didn't stop
them from filing a flurry of lawsuits
against the county last week. Just in
time to avoid the one-year statute of
limitations, 15 families have sued vari
ous departments, accusing them of
negligence during the rescue efforts.
In fact, these lawsuits are what orig
inally prompted the release of the
videos; the apparent idea was that the
footage would prove the rescuers to be
incompetent. James Rouse, the attor
ney for the families, fought a protract
ed battle with the county government
for the release of the tapes — until yes
terday, when they suddenly entered
the public sphere.
"As of yesterday, they didn't want to
give it to us," said Rouse. "Now they
want to give it to the whole world for
$25." And no doubt the world will buy,
cluck its collective tongue over the sad
state of our country, and then by slow
degrees forget that it ever happened.
Until the next tragedy, that is. After
all, the ax grinders are still out there.
And they're just waiting for the next
opportunity to sound off.
