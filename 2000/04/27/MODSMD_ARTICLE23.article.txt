A new view on Elian Gonzalez
In a more ideal, rational scxiety our
professors would offer us logical argu
ments and legitimate moral and intellectu
al guidance. Today, however, we see the
sort of nonsense that The Daily recounted
in the article printed yesterday, "Profs
react to Elian outcome." It is uncon
scionable to allow statements like those of
professors Eleanor Maccoby and Terry
Karl to go unchecked.
Professor Maccoby claims that Elian has
been treated improperly. His relatives
should say that his father loves him, but
Elian's father is not acting in his son's best
interest or out of love. It is not an act of
love to sell your child into slavery, and that
is precisely what Juan Gonzalez is asking
for. Additionally, Elian will not be placed
in his father's hands; he will be put under
the direct control of Fidel Castro. Elian's
father has no rights to his son, as there are
no rights in Cuba, only force.
Elian will not be able to have "a normal
childhood in the future" in Cuba. Cuba is
a brutal communist dictatorship. Healthy,
proper human life is impossible in a slave
state. Is it "normal" for a child to enter a
hard lalx>r and indoctrination camp at the
age of 11? Is it "normal" for a child to be
sent to a "re-adaptation" center to have
any experience of freedom brainwashed
away? Is it "normal" to live in a nation
where at any given moment, for any given

reason, the ruling dictator can have a per
son executed or imprisoned without even
a pretense of justice? Are these the condi
tions that Maccoby thinks will lead to
healthy psychological development?
Prof. Karl claims that Elian will have
free education and milk before the age of
seven, implying that Elian will benefit from
being in Cuba. Milk, like all commodities
in Cuba, is rationed out to citizens by the
government. Elian will receive a pitiful
amount of the milk he should have for
another year, and, once he is older than
seven, he will receive no more milk for the
rest of his life, short of purchasing it 011 the
black market.
Similarly, the education he will receive
will come from Cuban textbooks that are
more propaganda than fact. In communist
nations, the dictators who set all the poli
cies, including those for education, do not
want their citizens to know the truth; they
want them to blindly follow orders. Amer
ica, in comparison, has a remarkably free
market of goods and information. The
wealth that is produced in a capitalist
country, and to lesser extent a mixed econ
omy, virtually ensures a well being for citi
zens that is vastly better than can be
expected in a socialized nation.
Anyone who has looked at a newspaper
in the last several days has seen the terri
fied l(K)k 011 Elian's face as he is being con
fronted by an INS storm trooper. Far
worse awaits him in Cuba. Despite this fact,

Dr. Karl says it is "extremely difficult, if not
impossible, to show that any Cuban child
has a 'well-founded fear of persecution."'
Karl also says that political and civil rights
"aren't critical issues for a six-year old."
This is a ridiculous argument, it seeks to
prove that rights are not important to chil
dren because they do not think about
them. Children also do not think about
buying food, but if they do not eat they still
starve. Children may not think about their
rights, but they need their lives and prop
erty to be protected just as badly as every
other human being. In order to properly
exist by using one's mind, humans must be
free from the initiation of force to think. It
is precisely because children do not know
what they need and are incapable of taking
care of themselves that they are in the cus
tody of their parents or relatives. The
"rights of the parent" exist only so far as
they are compatible with and serve
towards the purpose of protecting the
individual rights of the child. It is because
Elian is a child that he needs someone to
protect his rights and look out for his best
interests. Neither his father nor any one
else in Cuba can fulfill that responsibility.
The arguments of both professors rest,
on some level, on treating Cuba like a nor
mal country. Check your premises. Castro
is a brutal tyrant. Psychologists should be
asking what kind of man viciously sup
presses and enslaves his own people. Polit
ital Scientists should be asking what kind
of system could dare to so blatantly violate
human rights. I urge my fellow students
and teachers not to be taken in by the
f;iultv arguments they have heretofore
been offered.
America must take the moral high
ground when considering Cuba. America
is a country where people still have some
of their freedoms protected Cuba, on the
other hand, is a prison. People do not risk
crossing miles of shark-infested waters to
escape America, but Cubans routinely risk
their lives for even the chance to live free.
In America Elian has a chance to live a nor
mal life befitting the dignity of the human
being. In Cuba, he will live as a slave or be
jnui(Jfved b) Castrofs government.,

Daily's coverage one-sided
As a fervent supporter of the New
ton/Villegas campaign, 1 feel ii is my obli
gation to thank 1 lie Daily for all of its
support during this campaign. After
Levingate and the 14 demerits we
received for blatant violations of cam
paign rules, I was worried that students
might finally become suspicions of our
tactics. I was afraid that students might
compare all the accusations we've made
about the corruption of the Liu/Dudas
slate to their zero demerits.
Hut then 1 picked up today s Daily and
knew that everything would be okay.
"Senate gives slate demerits," my friendly
Daily said. "Slate?" I lie trendy online
magazine?
But of course you were referring to the
Newton/Villegas slate. 1 lie PAC slate.
PAC. Newton. The Levingate Slate. 1
offer these several permutations of the
name to illustrate the many ways you
could have tilled the article in question,
rather than the conspicuously ambiguous
way you did title the article.
Between you and tne, that's the way
journalism should be: biased. I've had
enough of this "fair treatment" rigama
role. If only people like you had been
running the Washington Post when
Nixon was President, the world would be
a much more honest place now.

It's definitely worth compromising the
integrity of the Peninsula's Oldest Morn
ing Newspaper to influence ASSU elec
tions. Let me tell you: the .ASSU really
matters. I would sell my soul to get
expanded Marguerite service. We should
decide our votes on the basis of strangers'
endorsements and"the correct prioritiza
tion of the way the ASSU should empha
size issues," not on the basis of RAM
PANT CORRUPTION or ELECTION
PAMPERING.
So keep printing those clever editorial
columns (like Wednesday's: Newton gets
14 demerits â€” demerits must be uncon
stitutional!), and whatever you do,
1)( )N" I consider ( hanging your endorse
ment on the flimsy basis of 14 DEMER
ITS.

Responding to Srinivasan
I am writing in response to the April 25
letter to the editor ("'Janitors' column
misses the point") about the controversy
over the low pay afforded to custodial and
food service workers at Stanford. The
author of this letter, Balaji Srinivasan, uses
flawed, elitist logic to justify their low pay
and then proposes to a solution that is
downright offensive.
The main thrust of his argument is that
Stanford students are paid more for our
work on campus because of simple eco
nomic principles. I le writes that because
Stanford students are a highly skilled
group of people while janitorial training
requires "little more than handing some
one a mop and bucket" the market dictates
higher pay for students.
Let's compare cleaning bathrooms at a
dorm to a typical student job such as shelv
ing books at the library. Which requires
more training? Which is harder work?
Which would most people less like to do
given the choice? Cleaning bathrooms is
the answer to all three questions. So the
reason the student's jobs are higher paid
certainly isn't economic as Mr. Srinivasan
claims. I lie truth is we get more because
we are considered in a higher social c lass
and therefore entitled to luxuries like that
extra lili ticket on the dorm ski trip while
the custodial workers are denied the wage
necessary to adequately care for their fam
ilies.
Mr. Srinivasan further justifies paying

students a high wage by claiming that it is
a tactic to attract the top students to Stan
ford. This may be true, but it is certainly
not an economic justification for paying
the janitors less than a living wage.
Next, the author goes on to blame the
inequality of pay on "individual differ
ences." That is, because students are natu
rally smarter than janitors it is only natural
to pay them more This overlooks the facts
that the janitors are doing harder work
and have families to t;ike care of. He
writes, "Not everyone is smart enough to
go to Stanford, but virtually everyone has
the minimal level of intelligence required
to be a janitor."
He goes even farther, suggesting that
the workers will eventually be replaced by
robots. I find it very distressing that one of
my classmates would directly and publicly
insult the people who have been serving
him food and cleaning up after his mess
for more than four years. I am afraid that
SUch ingratitude is more common in the
.student population than most conscien
tious people think."
Finally, Mr. Srinivasan proposes a
"solution" to the problem that 1 find noth
ing short of appalling. He suggests that
instead of raising the pay of these workers,
Stanford management should offer them
birth control education because "it is sin
gularly irresponsible to have children if
one is incapable of feeding and clothing
them properly." These are human adults
we are talking about, and as such they
should have every expectation to get
enough pay to support a family. It is
absurd to suggest that an institution as
wealthy as Stanford should deny people
the economic means to take care of chil
dren.
Mr. Srinivasan claims that most Stan
ford students won't be willing to pay any
extra tuition to give the janitors a living
wage. In light of the organization I have
seen on campus and the upcoming May 1
rally in White Plaza, I think he is quite mis
taken. The janitors' contract is up for rene
gotiation in May and I am confidant that
student pressure will help the workers
leverage a better deal.

Senior, Human Biniogy
This letter is a response to Balaji Srini
vasan's April 25 letter to the editor. Balaji:
Although your elegant prose impressed
me, I find the condescending tone and
prejudiced content of your letter less than

impressive.
First, your division of human beings
into classes or types based on intelligence
level, social position and political leanings
disturbs me. I doubt that you know Jen
nifer YVekselbaum well enough to identi
fy the root of her "sort of activist senti
ment." 1 am even more convinced that
you do not know enough about the thou
sands of striking janitors to state that you
"feel it is safe to say that there is not an
agglomeration of the brilliant in the jani
torial ranks."
People do not take jobs as janitors sim
ply because they are too stupid to attend
Stanford University. A wide range of social
and political circumstances force people
into low-level jobs. Indeed, the very mar
ket economy which you hold up as some
sort of demi-god requires so large a pool of
unskilled laborers that corporations based
in rich countries like the United States feel
compelled to circumvent minimum wage
laws by employing illegal immigrants.
Second, your suggestion that unintelli
gent people do not deserve a living wage
strikes me as particularly misguided. All
workers deserve a living wage regardless of
intelligence level.
Third, 1 do not understand why you
believe that student activists speaking out
in support of the striking janitors "should
put their money where their mouths are."
It is Stanford University's responsibility to
make sure all of its employees receive a liv
ing wage. Anyone who feels that
Stanford is not fulfilling this duty has the
right to say so. In speaking out against the
University's policies, a student does not
assume Stanford's responsibilities as an
employer.
Finally, I see very interesting parallels
between your argument for monitoring
the procreation of people stupid enough
to produce children they are unable to
support and certain Nazi policies designed
to limit the procreation of so-called degen
erates. Yon have no right to judge another
human being's decision to bring a child
into this world, and vou certainly should
not assume th.it "unskilled laborers" bear
children merely because they are too
stupid to correctly use birth control or to
understand "the economic consequences
of having a c hild."
Perhaps you would do well to put your
late-night sessions with Ayn Rand on hold
long enough to engage in conversation
with the "unskilled workers" whose intelli
gence you so flippantly insult. 11l rough
conversation, you might come to see the
men and women who keep this campus

clean as real human beings deserving of a
living wage, rather than mere figures in
your Economics 1 textb<x>k.

Commission should educate students
This election has been inundated with
allegations of campaign misconduct on
both sides. Of course, the candidates are
taking the blame. However, 1 will argue
that a large part of the blame rests with
the elections commission. I find it prepos
terous that candidates get in trouble for
what their supporters do.
It is not possible for the candidates to
inform all their supporters of the cam
paign by-laws; only the schcx>l elections
commission has the resources and the
obligation to inform the student body of
all tht' campaign lAWfc. We mUst all follow
the campaign by-laws, but to do so, we
must be informed. Next year, the elec
tions commission should notify all stu
dents of the campaign rules, not just the
candidates.
1 lowever, until then the blame for
campaign violations by supporters of the
candidates lays with the elections commis
sion and not the candidates. So research
the issues (http://liududas.stanford.edu/
and http://pac.stanford.edu/) and vote for
whoever has the stronger platform, not
whoever has the least campaign allega
tions.
