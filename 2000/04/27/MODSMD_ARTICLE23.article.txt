A new view on Elian Gonzalez
In a more ideal, rational scxiety our
professors would offer us logical argu
ments and legitimate moral and intellectu
al guidance. Today, however, we see the
sort of nonsense that The Daily recounted
in the article printed yesterday, "Profs
react to Elian outcome." It is uncon
scionable to allow statements like those of
professors Eleanor Maccoby and Terry
Karl to go unchecked.
Professor Maccoby claims that Elian has
been treated improperly. His relatives
should say that his father loves him, but
Elian's father is not acting in his son's best
interest or out of love. It is not an act of
love to sell your child into slavery, and that
is precisely what Juan Gonzalez is asking
for. Additionally, Elian will not be placed
in his father's hands; he will be put under
the direct control of Fidel Castro. Elian's
father has no rights to his son, as there are
no rights in Cuba, only force.
Elian will not be able to have "a normal
childhood in the future" in Cuba. Cuba is
a brutal communist dictatorship. Healthy,
proper human life is impossible in a slave
state. Is it "normal" for a child to enter a
hard lalx>r and indoctrination camp at the
age of 11? Is it "normal" for a child to be
sent to a "re-adaptation" center to have
any experience of freedom brainwashed
away? Is it "normal" to live in a nation
where at any given moment, for any given

reason, the ruling dictator can have a per
son executed or imprisoned without even
a pretense of justice? Are these the condi
tions that Maccoby thinks will lead to
healthy psychological development?
Prof. Karl claims that Elian will have
free education and milk before the age of
seven, implying that Elian will benefit from
being in Cuba. Milk, like all commodities
in Cuba, is rationed out to citizens by the
government. Elian will receive a pitiful
amount of the milk he should have for
another year, and, once he is older than
seven, he will receive no more milk for the
rest of his life, short of purchasing it 011 the
black market.
Similarly, the education he will receive
will come from Cuban textbooks that are
more propaganda than fact. In communist
nations, the dictators who set all the poli
cies, including those for education, do not
want their citizens to know the truth; they
want them to blindly follow orders. Amer
ica, in comparison, has a remarkably free
market of goods and information. The
wealth that is produced in a capitalist
country, and to lesser extent a mixed econ
omy, virtually ensures a well being for citi
zens that is vastly better than can be
expected in a socialized nation.
Anyone who has looked at a newspaper
in the last several days has seen the terri
fied l(K)k 011 Elian's face as he is being con
fronted by an INS storm trooper. Far
worse awaits him in Cuba. Despite this fact,

Dr. Karl says it is "extremely difficult, if not
impossible, to show that any Cuban child
has a 'well-founded fear of persecution."'
Karl also says that political and civil rights
"aren't critical issues for a six-year old."
This is a ridiculous argument, it seeks to
prove that rights are not important to chil
dren because they do not think about
them. Children also do not think about
buying food, but if they do not eat they still
starve. Children may not think about their
rights, but they need their lives and prop
erty to be protected just as badly as every
other human being. In order to properly
exist by using one's mind, humans must be
free from the initiation of force to think. It
is precisely because children do not know
what they need and are incapable of taking
care of themselves that they are in the cus
tody of their parents or relatives. The
"rights of the parent" exist only so far as
they are compatible with and serve
towards the purpose of protecting the
individual rights of the child. It is because
Elian is a child that he needs someone to
protect his rights and look out for his best
interests. Neither his father nor any one
else in Cuba can fulfill that responsibility.
The arguments of both professors rest,
on some level, on treating Cuba like a nor
mal country. Check your premises. Castro
is a brutal tyrant. Psychologists should be
asking what kind of man viciously sup
presses and enslaves his own people. Polit
