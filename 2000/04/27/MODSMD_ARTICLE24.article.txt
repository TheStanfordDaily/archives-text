# Stanford Board of Trustees needs student input
## 
### TY CLEVENGER GUEST COLUMNIST 
When President Gerhard Casper
addressed the Undergraduate Senate a
few weeks ago, someone in the audience
asked hint whether he supported the
appointment of students to Stanford's
governing hoard, the Board of Trustees.
I le said he did not, and something about
his reasoning sounded rather familiar.
Once upon a time, while I was an
undergraduate at Texas A&M University,
1 was asked to testify before the Texas Sen
ate Finance Committee on why students
should be appointed to our university's
governing board.
I he rather imperial chairman of the
committee asked why I thought students
in their late teens or early twenties could
serve in a position of such responsibility.
As was his custom, he never really gave
me an opportunity to answer the question.
I've had .1 few years since then to for
mulate m\ answer, Mr. Chairman, and it
goes something like this: Kvery day, young
men and women — the same age as
undergraduates — are sworn in to our

armed services, granted security clear
ances and entrusted to guard our national
security secrets at the risk of their own
lives. Every day, young men and women
are sworn in as local, state and federal law
enforcement officers. Every day (at least it
seems like it in this area), young men and
women start and manage companies
worth millions or billions of dollars. In
other words, "young" doesn't necessarily
mean irresponsible or incompetent. That's
all the more true of graduate students,
many of whom already have held positions
of responsibility.
More importantly, Stanford itself
would benefit from the presence of stu
dents — and faculty and staff— on the
Board of Trustees. The University needs a
board that is independent and indepen
dently informed.
A handful of students, faculty and staff
would not constitute a majority and thus
could not "take over" the board. They
could, however, provide a broader range
of input. And the more input, the better.
Several weeks ago, about 30 mid-level
Stanford administrators were asked to
identify the main obstacle to reducing

alcohol abuse on campus. Their responses
— which have not yet been released pub
licly — were rather telling: (lit- mid-level
administrators said the biggest obstacle to
reducing alcohol abuse was mixed signals
from top administrators (i.e. the president
and provost).
I wasn't told what the "mixed signals"
were, but it's hard to imagine that anyone
could iiiil to appreciate the seriousness of
alcohol abuse. I.ast year a drunken frater
nity member fell off the frat house and
pulverized his face beyond recognition.
According to one administrator, Stanford
sends two or more students to the emer
gency room each weekend with alcohol
poisoning.
So what does that have to do with stu
dents on the board? At present, the presi
dent has substantial control over the flow
of information to the trustees. I'm not sug
gesting that's corrupt — 1 have no reason
to doubt the integrity of the president.
What I am suggesting is that the "backup"
oversight system — the Board of Trustees
— may not be working as well as it should.
When the president is headed in the
wrong direction or overlooking some

thing, it's the duty of the board to tell him.
But the board can't do that unless it knows
what's going on.
This became clear to me when I started
trying to reform the campus post office. I
learned that the post office had been a
wreck for at least 15 years. In one case,
hundreds of applicants weren't consid
ered for admission because the post office
delayed their applications for months.
Despite all the complaints from students,
faculty and staff, the administration's offi
cial line was that it had no control over the
U.S. Postal Service.
That may be true, but it's not like I have
control over the U.S. Postal Service either.
Yet our merry band of students has
done more to clean up the post office in
two months than the president or provost
have done in the last 10 years. The presi
dent wasn't hindered by a lac k of control
over the post office — he was hindered by
a lack of effort.
That's not intended as a parting shot at
the president: he has to set his priorities
according to his best judgement, and it's
impossible for him to solve every problem
that comes across his desk. But I dare say

that, with a 10-minute presentation to the
trustees, I could have convinced them that
the post office should be a much higher
priority for the administration than it has
been. Having convinced the trustees, the
administration would automatically be
"convinced" as well. That's the board's job
— to provide independent, unbiased per
spective and oversight.
Finally, student trustees are not a new
idea. Many public and private institutions,
including the University of California,
MIT and Princeton, appoint either cur
rent students or just-graduated students to
their governing boards. All the concerns
raised by President Casper were ironed
out years ago.
According to outgoing ASSU President
Mike Levin, Gerhard Casper asked the
ASSU to delay its request for student rep
resentation on the board until his succes
sor was named. The successor, current
Provost John Hennessy, was named April
4. President-elect Hennessy, we look for
ward to hearing from you.
