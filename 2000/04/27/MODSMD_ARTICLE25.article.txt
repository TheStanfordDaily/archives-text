running today through Sunday at
Ojai, Calif .
One of the most prestigious
tournaments on the West Coast,
the Pac-10 Individual Champi
onships is divided into two sepa
rate tournaments: the Men's Inter

for the top-four players of each
Pac-10 team and the Men's Pac-10
Invitational Championships for
the next four players.
The winner of the Men's Inter
collegiate Pac-10 Championships

West Regional of the NCAA Indi
vidual Championships held in late
May.

In singles, junior Alex Kim, se
nior Geofl Abrams, sophomore
K.J. I lippensteel and junior Scott)
Scott will compete for the Cardi
nal. In doubles, Kim and Abrams
will team up while 11 ippensteel will
join freshman David Martin to bat
tle for the title.
According to head coach Dick
Could, all of the Cardinal players
have a good chance of winning the
tournament.
"I have faith in all of our guys,"
Gould said. "Anyone can go in
there and come out with the title."
As demonstrated bv Ilieir excel
lent individual performance ibis
year, Gould's assessment is proba
bly accurate.
In singles, Kim, the No. (> play
er in the nation, is the highest
ranked individual in the Pac-10.
Finishing the season with a 35-6
record overall, Kim has also won ti
tles this year at the I FA Regional
Fournainent and the National
Collegiate Tennis ( lassie.
Abrams, ranked eighth in the
nation, is currenth on a roll after
winning his last 17 matches of the

season.
Before lie was sidelined with a
ruptured spleen, Hippensteel was
t he No. 1 player in the country
alter winning the singles title at the
I I A All-American (Championships
in ()ctober.
In doubles, Kim and Abrains,
the No. I duo in the nation, are
clearly the favorites. Finishing the
dual match season with a 32-5
record overall, the tandem h;is
won titles at the National Colle
giate Tennis Classic and the 1 L\
All-American C championships.
I fippensteel and Martin should
also makea strong run for the title.
Although the duo has not played
much together this season because
of Hippensteel's injurv, they did
win the title at the ITA Regional
Tournament in November.
However, the Stanford players
will face tough competition from
their counterparts No. 2 UCLA,
No. 17 USC and the other l'ac-10
teams, tournament favorites from
UCLA include Jong-Mill Lee and
Jean-Noel Crinda. Lee defeated
Kim last weekend in LCI .As upset

5-2 victory over the Cardinal,
while (irinda, the Bruins' top play
er the past two years, is an All-
Ameriean.
In the other tournament, the
Men's l'ac-10 Invitational Cham
pionships, the Cardinal will send

Martin, junior Ali Ansari and
freshmen Scott Lipsky and Carter
Morris in singles.
In doubles, Ansari will team up
with Scott while Lipsky and Morris
will play together.

the Pac-10 Individual Champi

Junior Scotty Scott reaches to make contact in an earlier match for the Cardinal. Scott will compete in singles com
petition at today's Men's Intercollegiate Pac-10 Championships.
"One of the good things about
these tournaments is that eight
guys get to play," Could said.
"Sometimes it's tough for very
good players like Scott Lipsky and
Carter Morris to sit and watch.
This tournament will give them a
chance to play."
While Gould hopes all his play

ers compete well at Ojai, his major
concern is keeping them healthy
throughout the weekend for the
upcoming NCAA Champi
onships, which begin May 13.
"The Pac-10 Individuals is a
pretty intense tournament,"
Gould said. "While the tourna
ment will give the players good
experience outside of the pres
sure of the team context, I'm hop
ing that we can get out of there
without any stress-related in
juries."
