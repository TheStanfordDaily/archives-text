# Sager and Gall work to tame Mustangs

### TIM KANE STAFF WRITER 
The typical Stanford Tuesday baseball game
feels entirely dillerent from that of a weekend
series. A parade of (Cardinal pitchers shut down
some non-conference opponent, inevitably re
sulting in a Stanford victory, and the whole
thing seems entirely unmemorable and anonv
mous.
Hie latest Tuesday victims were the (lal l'ol\
Mustangs (20-21), who fell to the No. 4 (lardinal
(32-10) by an 11-3 score Tuesday night at
Sunken Diamond.
Sophomore Mike Wodnicki earned the win
for the Cardinal to raise his record to 3-0 on the
year, while (lal Poly s |oe Smith look the loss,
falling to 5-3.
As it turned out, this game was actuallv mem
orable for a pair of reasons: the return of sopho
more Brian Sager to the mound after a month
long layoff to rest an injured shoulder, and John
Gall's single in the fifth that left him with 337
hits in his career, tied for tops in I'ac-10 history.
Sager made the start for the Cardinal and
went two innings, limited In the coaches to

throwing about 36 pitches. The righthander
gave up one run on two hits, but struck out
three Mustang hitters.
"I think he looked good, considering lie's
been off for five weeks," head coach Mark Mar
quess said. "He had good velocity and preth
good control for not having thrown for that
length of time. Tin vers pleased."
" 1 wanted to get out there a lot sooner, to the
point where I thought it was going to be last
week, but it's something that vou realh can't
push," said Sager, who took to the hill after re
ceiving medical approval Monday. "( The shoul
der] is something that's nagging, but not real se
rious."
Both Sager and Marquess declined to give a
spe< ific date as for w hen the riglity would reen
ter the starting rotation, hi it Sager will probabl)
see some action out of the bullpen in the next
few games.
Meanwhile, Call, the senior third baseman
who leads the team's regulars with a .36f> aver
age and 4!) RBI, will soon add the I'ac-10 record
to a slew of others he has broken this vear, in
cluding Stanford's records for hits, doubles and
RBl's, while c hasing the Cardinal career-aver

age mark.
"It's great. I take a lot of pride in it now, but
we've got a hunc hof games left," said (>all ol his
latest record. I lopelullv I can finish strong and
have m\ best year since I've been here.'
After Sager, the usual mass of Cardinal pitc h
ers took to the hill â€” seven in all, with no one
pitcher going more than two innings. Fresh
man Rvan Cloger, who took over for Sager in
the third, was the only other (Cardinal pitcher to
be scored upon, allowing two runs in a third of
an inning.
Down 3-1 in the third inning, Stanford ex
ploded for five runs to claim I he lead for good,
helped bv two Cal l'oly errors and a two-RBI
double bv ('.all.
I he C arcliual added another lour runs in the
bottom ol the eighth, three of which came on a
homerun to right field by senior centei fielder
Fdmund Muth, giving him his team-leading
13th blast of the year.
I lie Cardinal will next take to the field Fri
dav night against Cal to begin a crucial three
game set lasting the entire weekend. I he first
pitch will be at (>:()() pin, under the lights at
Sunken Diamond.
