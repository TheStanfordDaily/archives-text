### BEN ALLEN EDITORIALS STAFF 
Vin Lananna, tho Director ol I rack and Field at
Stanford, keeps his promises.
That's why, while much of the locus of the track
world turns to Philadelphia this weekend for the IVnn
Relays, Lananna and his distance troops will he head
ed to Des Moines, lowa, for the9lst annual Drake Re
lays. keeping a promise Lananna made to the meet's
retiring director years ago.
Drake, however, is 110 second-class meet. 111 a coun
try where track and field is a hard sell, this year will
mark Drake's 35th straight sell-out of its I ">,()()()-seat
stadium.
And considering the list of big guns Stanford will
send to lowa, Lananna's promise to bringa fully tiring
squad to Drake will c ertainly he fulfilled.

legs of 1,200-meters, 400-, 800- and I,60( (-meters, re

minutes, 5.95 seconds indoors this year.
Junior Danielle Spurlock will replace Klmore for
the DMR. Glynn, Hyatt and Fleshman teamed with
junior Jayna Smith to take the national indoor DMR
title in March.
The men will allow their thoroughbreds to cut
loose at Drake, a choice that has been somewhat re
stricted in this ()lympic year.
