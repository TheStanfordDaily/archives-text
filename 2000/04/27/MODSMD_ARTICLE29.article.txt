# Students press for 'diversity focus' house
## 
### ROSE O'GARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A group of students is trying to coordinate a new
type of focus house offering "true" diversity, to ac
commodate students who desire to live a dorm with
out a majority of one ethnicity or culture.
"Coming into Stanford as a freshman, 1 didn't
want to be a minority in a predominantly white
dorm," said Orlando Lara, a freshman helping to co
ordinate the project, "but 1 also didn't want to be a
majority in a predominantly Chicano/Latino dorm."
"I thought that there were probably a lot of other
students at Stanford, and incoming freshmen, who
felt the same way," he said.
The proposal sprung from an observation that
freshman Ferry Lee-St. John made during a pro
gram two weeks ago. Ujamaa, the African-American
theme dorm, and Okada, the Asian-American theme
dorm, came together for a viewing of "Saigu," a film
about the Korean-American experience during the
1992 Los Angeles riots.
"We talked about Koreans and blacks on the Stan
ford campus, and 1 came to the conclusion that there
is very little interaction, if any at all," said Lee-St.
John.
A quick glance at ethnic theme dorms confirmed
his thinking.
"Though 1 think that ethnic theme dorms are
great instruments for unifying minority students at
this predominately white school and thus are very im
portant, I also see theme dorms as fostering the sepa
ration of the different minority communities," he
said.
In an e-mail to other students he thought might be
interested, Lee-St John explained, "As a person who
is half black-half Chinese, the segregation of minority
groups around campus greatly disturbs me as I know
each group contains many wonderful aspects that
both groups could enjoy and benefit from."
"I got a bunch of responses" from the e-mail, he
said. "There were lots of people interested in the
dorm and there were also people expressing con
cerns about it."
Some of those concerns expressed immediately
following Lee-St. John's first e-mail addressed the
perceived disregard of non-minority students, the
regulation of the percentages of minority students in
the dorm and the choice of dorm.
The e-mail was addressed, "Dear fellow minority
students of '03," which some people felt was exclu
sionary. Lee-St. John authored a second e-mail which
clarified his hope to include students of all back

grounds.
Josh Radley, a freshman who received Lee-St.
John's e-mails, was one student who expressed initial
concerns but admires the spirit of the project. "I com
pletely agree with Terry that separation among dif
ferent ethnic groups is sometimes a problem. Terry
saw this problem and offered a solution to that prob
lem - there is no right solution, but after his clarifica
tions, I really can't find fault with his idea."
Said Lee-St. John, "Lots of people sent e-mails ex
pressing the idea that everyone should be able to look
at other people in the same way as they look at them
selves, expressing a desire to do away with separation.
But I think that encountering other cultures, learn
ing about them and relating to them is best."
Lee-St. John originally proposed Toyon as the site
for the dorm. After discussion with other coordina
tors, though, the group has decided to aim for Amer
ican Studies house, which is losing its theme status
after this year and reverting to the name Murray.
"Toyon is too big to foster the kind of community
that we are shooting for," said Lee-St. John. "We want
everyone to get to know each other. Murray is about
the right size, and is relatively easy to get in if you
draw preferred."
The other concern is the regulation of the num
bers and percentages of minorities within the house.
Ming Wong, a freshman who received Lee-St. John's
e-mail, reiterated, "One of the concerns expressed
was that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to reg
ulate the racial [and] ethnic composition of the dorm,
due to problems of defining races, etc. I think the
composition of the dorm isn't as important as the spir
it in which it was formed."
for one, hopes that this does not become a
problem. "We don't want to get to the point where we
have to label people and fill percentages," he com
mented, "but we still want to make sure that we have
a diverse population."
Before any kind of regulation can occur, though,
the project would require University support, which
the group has not obtained yet. At the moment, the
movement is simply to encourage students of all eth
nicities and lifestyles who are interested in a dorm
which would foster the understanding of these differ
ent cultures to draw into the house.
Based on how it goes next year, the coordinating
students hope to petition for University support of
the dorm. "I am mostly concerned in making this
dorm official," said Lara. "That process will take all
year next year, but it is something that 1 am very ded
icated to. I want to see it happen and I will do every
thing I can to make it happen."
