Stanford students and faculty
arc accustomed to seeing the Uni
versity in the media, but many
may not realize that for 34 years,
the media has been in the Univer
sity. Next year will be no different,
as 12 accomplished journalists
have been chosen to be Knight

Fellows for the 20()()-2()01 acade
mic year.
The Knight Fellowship pro

which covers the cost of tuition and
a living stipend for each journalist
for one year.
Next year's Knight Fellows ap
pear to be an extremely talented
and influential group of journal
ists, according to Communications
Prof. Marion Lewenstein, a mem
ber of the Knight Fellowship Pro
gram Committee.
" Fhe journalists selected are
ones we hope will make a differ
ence in the world following their
year at Stanford," said Lewenstein.
"They have all already achieved
some sort of recognition for their
journalism and have demonstrat
ed a solid grasp of core journalistic
principles â€” honesty, integrity
and fairness."
The 12 Knight Fellowship re
cipients are Jerry Large, columnist
for the Seattle Times; Lawrence
Sheets, bureau chief of the Cauca
sus Region for the Reuters News
Service; David Stabler, classical
music critic for The Oregonian;
Brian Willoughby, social issues re
porter for the Vancouver
Columbian; Tom Arvisojr., editor
of the Navajo limes; Bonnie DeS
imone, sports staff writer for the

Chicago Tribune; Tim Johnson,
Bogata bureau chief for the Miami
Herald; Martha Mendoza, nation
al investigation reporter for the As
sociated Press; Bob Moser, editor
of the Independent Weekly; Annie
Nakao, staff writer for the San
Francisco Examiner; Judith
N ichols, team leader for the break
ing news and online division of the
Arizona Republic; and Gini Sikes,
producer for M TV News.
Fellowship recipients will per
forin a number of services on cam
pus next year, according to James
Bettinger, deputy director of the
Knight Fellowship program.
"The group will do a variety of
things at Stanford," said Bettinger.
"They will give guidance to jour
nalism students and speak out to
student groups, particularly those
groups whose interests they share.
For example, this year's fellows
from foreign countries were a re
source for a class in international
relations, lecturing about their ex
periences in different countries."
"Fellows contribute enormous
ly to 'he campus," said Lewenstein.
"They mix with undergraduates in
classes and add a depth and
breadth of knowledge al>out cer
tain issues as well. We have had
many Knight Fellows help out in
various departments around cam
pus, because they are very well in

formed about many topics."
Knight Fellows will follow an in
dependent course of study about a
specific topic of interest, and will
not take classes for grades or credit.
"This program is a great chance
for the University to be involved in
educating people not interested in
a meal ticket but simply interested
in learning for learning's sake,"
said Bettinger. "Knight Fellows re
ally are looking to become broad
er, deeper, better journalists."
Fellowship recipients ex
pressed excitement about the
chance to pursue an area of study
unimpeded by deadline pressure.
"After 20 years of daily journal
ism, having room to breathe with
out fatigue and deadlines will be
great," said DeSimone, who will
examine the shift from children
spontaneously playing pick-up
sports in the past to more
arranged and structured youth
sports today. "I think a year at
Stanford will help me to gain a
fresh perspective on the topics I
cover."
DeSimone plans on taking
courses in psychology, sociology
and history, and will talk to Stan
ford athletes about youth sports
programs, looking at the link be
tween sports and family dynamics.
The foreign Knight Fellows will
be named next month.
