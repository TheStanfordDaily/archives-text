Representatives from Netscape's Mozilla Project
stormed into Sweet Hall's computer cluster on Tues
day, in what is becoming an increasingly common
method of recruiting Stanford students.
Armed with boxes of pizza, cases of Coca-Cola and
t-shirts touting their company, the Mozilla represen
tatives spent the evening trying to get their name out
in the battle to win over potential employees.
"We thought, what do college students need?
Caffeine, food and free clean clothes," said
Netscape's Seth Spitzer, a recent Stanford alumnus.
"The turnout was pretty positive, and we were able
to get a few people who were intersted in internships
and jobs. We'd like to get some young blood into
Netscape, so coming here was a matter of necessity."
However, spending a lew hundred dollars on
pizza and t-shirts is only the tip of the iceberg when it
comes to high-tech companies competing to hire
fresh talent. Many companies have tried to woo com
puter science students over expensive dinners.
For example, Microsoft took about two dozen
Stanford students out for a $5,000 dinner earlier this
year. "They just decided to take us to Sundance and
said that we didn't have a limit," said senior Benjamin
Carter.
Others say they have been deluged by offers from
recruiters who want to meet with them. "I get at least
three or four phone calls per day from recruiters,"
said coterminal computer science student Jed
Burgess, who was only looking for a summer job.
"Now I'm almost scared to answer my phone. I've al
ready chosen a summer job and at this point it's real
ly just a lot of saying, 'Thank you, but I'm not inter
ested,' " he said.
Many computer science majors said that although
they enjoyed the free dinners, pizza and other gim
micks, these factors did not play a role in their choice
of where to work.
"It's good for marketing and name recognition,"

said senior Alex Roetter. "I don't think it's often good
for recruiting."
Carter agreed, noting that what the company is
willing to do for its employees after they are hired is
more important than what they are doing while re
cruiting.
"It makes people feel good about themselves, but I
don't think it really sways anyone in the end," he said.
"When I look at a company, I look at what they offer
me in terms of salary, benefits, stock options and all of
the other perks that go along with it."
Starting salaries in the high-tech industry range
between $45,000 and $65,000, according the the Ca
reer Development Center, and many companies
offer a variety of additional benefits in an effort to lure
potential employees.
The search engine Google, for example, offers em
ployees stock options, two free meals per day pre
pared by a chef and a professional masseuse.
"It shows that Google really cares about its em
ployees and wants it to be a fun environment, so indi
rectly, it affected my decision." said senior Brian
Milch, who accepted a job offer from Google.
Others have tried to differentiate themselves sim
ply by offering larger salaries than the competition.
Recently, e-commerce startup Car Order.com offered
a starting salary of $200,000 per year with a signing
bonus of a 2000 BMW 323 Ci coupe for programmers
and business managers.
Carter speculated that much of the drive for these
high offers comes from a need to keep up with a stan
dard that is constantly being raised by companies des
perate for employees.
"When somebody starts doing things, all of the
others feel as though they need to also in order to
keep up," said Carter. "If a company doesn't, people
might view them as cheap and not interested in their
programmers."
"I do think it's a little out of hand," said Milch, re
ferring specifically to CarOrder.com's offer. "I don't
think that's a way to attract really serious candidates.
Instead, it's more of a publicity stunt."
