# Athletes face problems in scheduling classes, practice

Well on its way to a sixth con
secutive Sears Director's Cup Tro
phy, there is no doubt that Stan
ford has one of the best collegiate
athletic programs in the country.
However, athletes at Stanford
have the added challenge of bal
ancing year-round afternoon prac
tices with demanding course pro
grams and degree requirements,
many of which meet at times that
conflict with their practices.
Junior Tom Hunt, a varsity
fencer and physics major, said of
one class that conflicted, "I just
didn't take the ( lass. It was option
al, but it's frustrating not being
able to take afternoon classes.
Practice really cuts back on the
electives you can take."
Sophomore wrestler Justin
Walker, an English major, said,
"I've only had a couple of classes
that have conflicted, but they
weren't essential so I just didn't
take them."
Senior Mark Madsen, an eco
nomics major and basketball play
er, said, "During winter quarter,
we have practice between one and
four in the afternoon, so we either
take a class in the morning or the
night."
Madsen did note that due to the
nature of his sport, he was able to
take just about any course offered
in spring quarter.
Many other athletes have not
yet had too many conflicting class
es, because of their ways of sched
uling classes.
"I haven't had any conflicts
yet," said sophomore Becky Hop
kinson, an environmental engi
neering major who is also a mem
ber of the crew team. "I pretty
much try just to schedule around
practice."
If the situation arose, "1 would

weigh my options carefully," said
sophomore wrestler Chuck Pair
banks, a product design major.
"I'd need to see how much prac
tice I'd miss, if I'd be able to ever
take the class again, and how inter
ested I am in the class."
Verity Powell, the athletes' ad
visor at the Undergraduate Advis
ing Center, often has to deal with
this problem.
"Often times it had to be a ne
gotiation between the coach and
student and the department,"
Powell said. "The kids may have to
miss practice for an afternoon
class, but most coaches are willing
to make an exception if the kids
ask."
Keiko Tokuda, a sophomore
tennis player pursuing a double
major of psychology and Interna
tional Relations, has noticed other
problems with her plan of study.
"Most of the IR classes meet for
two hours in the afternoon and
they go maybe a half-hour too
long," says Tokuda. "I also can't
make a lot of sections either, since
I'm often away on Thursdays and
Fridays."
Some majors offer more flexi
ble schedules with required classes
available in the morning and with
sections early in the week.
Also, Powell credited the Writ
ing and Critical Thinking and In
troduction to the Humanities pro
grams for being extremely accom
modating to athletes, while noting
that chemistry and engineering
labs happen almost always in the
afternoon.
The most common complaint
was the inability to take freshman
and sophomore seminars, which
are offered mainly in the after
noons.
"I haven't been able to take the
very small, highly interesting sem
inars which mostly meet during
practice," said Tokuda.

Director of Freshman and
Sophomore Programs Sharon
Palmer, who oversees the fresh
man/sophomore seminar pro
gram, said that this is a problem
that her office was looking into fix
ing.
"The goal of the seminars is to
make them accessible and avail
able to all students so that under
graduates can get to know faculty
during their first two years at Stan
ford," Palmer said.
"Our athletes are great to have
in class," said Palmer. However,
"it's ... up to the faculty when sem
inars will be taught."
Both Powell and Palmer have
tried to address this problem, and
Powell noted "there were more
seminars offered in the evening
and morning this year than last
year."
Palmer said she hopes that ath
letes will consider looking at a
broader assortment of seminars,
and not just one or two, which
would considerably increase their
chances of finding a seminar that
fits into their schedule.
"We have a number of available
spaces in seminars offered every
quarter, including those taught at
night," she said.
Despite all of the problems with
scheduling and occasionally hav
ing to miss practice for a class or
being unable to take a class, most
Stanford athletes wouldn't change
their experience.
"Like most athletes here, I'm
here for the education first," said
Hopkinson. "That takes prece
dence over athletics."
"The thing that's great about
our school is it doesn't give prefer
ence or special privileges to ath
letes," said Tokuda. "Everyone
has done something great here,
regardless of whether it was athlet
ic or not, and that's one of the rea
son's I'm here."
