# CDC survey prompts change

### AMIT GARG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Career Development Cen
ter's annual survey is underway,
and it's results are mixed.
"The CDC is a tool to help stu
dents search the market and find
the best job for themselves," said
Robert Thirsk, director of the
CDC.
He added, "One thing [that is]
important to understand is stu
dent expectations. Our function is
not to find a job itself , but to pro
vide the resources, such as work
shops, interviews, employer visits
and career fairs."
Some students have expressed
concern over the usefulness of the
CDC.
"I did not use CDC to find post
college job, but I did use it to try
find a summer internship," said
senior Kaushik Mukherjee, a
chemistry major. "For what 1 was
looking for, career fairs were use
ful, but 1 do wish they had more
companies other than consulting
and banking. I actually ended up
finding a summer internship on
my own."
Freshman Timothy Crow, a
computer science major, said, "I
tried to get an internship through
the CDC and it was definitely not
useful. I wanted to work in Ger
many but the CDC they could not
help me with that."
Grow added, "I ended up find
ing the internship by myself. The
CDC actually had a list of German
companies but they couldn't re
lease it. I wish there was less bu
reaucracy."
Senior Amy Burch, a compara
tive literature major, said, "It is
similar to the focus assistant and
advising associate in your fresh
man year because you just get a su
perfluous feeling. They can help,

but it is really up to you."
Other students, however,
praised the CDC.
Sophomore Etan Ilfeold, a
physics major, said, "I only used
[the CDC] once. I took documents
on how to put together a resume,
which I did not have until then. I
found them to be helpful."
Senior David Chen, an electri
cal engineering major, said, "I
found an interview through Job
trak. That was useful and I found
through it my post-college job at
Strong Front, a computer game
company."
Chen added, "Jobtrak is a Web
site and I do not know the role of
the CDC in it. But the CDC's ca
reer fairs are nice because they
have lots of companies and give a
venue to different opportunities."
The CDC's own annual sur
veys, available online, indicate stu
dents have mixed reactions.
While about 50 percent of stu
dents praised the CDC's job
search tools like Jobtrak for lead
ing them to high-paying employ
ment, many have complained
about the difficulty of locating jobs
through the CDC that suit their
specific needs.
Thirsk said, "We want to know
what students like but especially
what they do not like about the
CDC. Only this way can we im
prove the quality of our services."
Thirsk explained that the CDC
gets most of its funds from the of
fice of the Vice Provost of Student
Affairs. It also charges potential
employers a fee for taking part in
career fairs. Periodically, it re
ceives small donations, though it
does not actively solicit them.
"The CDC is here to help stu
dents and alumni reach their ca
reer goals," said Brian Carter,
worker at the Reference Files Ser
vices.
