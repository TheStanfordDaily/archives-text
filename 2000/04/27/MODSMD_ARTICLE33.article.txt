### DANIEL MOREAU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
To celebrate National Poetry
Month, poet and Fnglish Prof.
Kenneth Fields, five Stegner Fel
lows and six undergraduates read
their favorite poems last night at
the Stanford Bookstore.
This reading is part of a nation
wide series of poetry events, orga
nized by the national poet laure
ate, Robert Pinsky.
After the reading, Fields spoke
on the importance of having a Na
tional Poetry Month.
"Poetry, unlike prose, is not
something we hear everyday," he
said. "We need to take time to lis
ten to another, underappreciated
aspect of our language."
Julie Orringer, a Stegner Fel
low in fiction, echoed Fields's sen
timent.
"Poetry deserves an entire
month devoted to its apprecia
tion; it merits our pause," Or
ringer said. "As a nation, we are
underexposed to poetry. Despite
its compact and dense nature, po
etry is not found in movies or tele
vision, which are essentially prosa
ic."
Senior Kate Didech, who was
among the undergraduates who
read last night, said, "I feel that
poetry is often overshadowed by
fiction. National Poetry Month
brings poetry to the forefront of
American letters, and is equally
beneficial to poets and to those un
familiar with poetry."
Fnglish Prof. John L'Heureux,
also a writer, commented on the
reading with enthusiasm.
"It was wonderful, joyous,
funny, a rich expression of verse,"
L'Heureux said. "The poems read

tonight encompassed a striking
variety of experiences, common to
us all in one way or another."
Adam Johnson, another Stegn
er Fellow in fiction, also elaborat
ed on the need for a National Po
etry Month as well.
"Poetry is an endangered
species," he said. "Almost educa
tional, this event raises awareness
for poetry. In order to enjoy poet
ry truly, one has to devote time
and effort to it. National Poetry
Month provides such a setting."
ZZ Packer, also a Stegner Fel
low in fiction, said that "the read
ing was a good opportunity to
hear other people's favorite
poems. Hopefully, it will entice
people to look up these poets on
their own."
To add humor and fun to the
event, the Stegner Fellows wore
matching bowling shirts embroi
dered with their nicknames,
which read on the back "Pneu
man's High Rollers."
Orringer explained, "It was the
name of Angela Pneuman's fa
ther's bowling team." Pneuman is
a Stegner Fellow who was sched
uled to read last night but was re
placed by Packer.
"Pneuman's sponsorship lend
ed a touch of holiness to the
event," Orringer added with a
grin.
Indeed, the Stegner Fellows in
fiction and in poetry have chal
lenged each other to a friendly
competition of bowling.
Stegner Fellow Joanie Mack
owski also read last night. The un
dergraduates — Didech, Sam
Brown, Ben D'Ewart, Ben Kleave
land, Colin O'Grady and Zach
Udko — were picked by Stegner
Fellow in poetry Rick Barot.
