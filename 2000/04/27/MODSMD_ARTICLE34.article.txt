# Cantor overwhelms the senses

### ANNE CORTINA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Walking into the Cantor Arts Center can be
overwhelming. The bronze-plated doors open
up to a two story marble-walled foyer, complete
with skylight and brass fixtures — a sight to be
hold.
But the entrance is only the first of many ex
quisite sights the Cantor Arts Center has to
offer. From ancient Chinese pottery to eigh
teenth-century French furniture to contempo
rary Native American art, the Center offers pa
trons a wide range of artistic styles, ages and
media to explore.
One of the center's current exhibits features
the work of Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray.
The exhibit, put together by Asst. Art Prof. I.eah
Dickerman and art graduate student Jill
Dawsey, contains some of the artists' most mem
orable works, including "rotoreliefs," or card
board records decorated so that when they spin,
they create an optical illusion, such as a rolling
eyeball or a Twilight Zone-esque swirl.
Though the comparatively small room hous
ing the rotoreliefs has been used for exhibits de
signed by Stanford faculty twice in the last 15
months, it has also been used for other unusual
things, such as the projection of the film "Fly
though." The film showed a journey through
the body in all its detailed splendor.
"It's always used for some sort of experimen
tal thing," said curator for education Patience
Young.
The center is also currently hosting an ex
hibit on Japanese ceramics, "Shaped with a Pas
sion." The collection includes pieces made in fa
mous, ancient kiln sites in Japan, such as Shi
garaki. An exhibit on contemporary printmak
ing will replace the pottery, housed in a large
room on the first floor, at the end of May. Next
fall, it will contain an exhibit on hair in African
culture and art.
"In African culture, hair symbolizes age,
marital status, so it's very significant," said
Young. The exhibit will feature pottery and
photos of traditional hair styles.
Though these exhibits change over the
course of the year, there are many permanent
installations. Rooms representing art from Asia,
Oceania, the ancient Mediterranean, Africa,
Native American and ancient American com
munities and separate rooms for early 19th-cen

lury and early 2()th-centurv art, as well as two
rooms lor contemporai v art cover virtually
every possible interest.
Tliey also employ evei v medium imaginable:
one room hosts a group ol ('.hinese foot-binding
shoes, another the gold spike used to commem
orate the completion ol the transcontinental
railroad, and yet another a beaded buckle rep
resentation of Marilyn Monroe's lace.
(hitside on ;i terrace, a moving red sculpture
designed by an engineer shines against the blue
sky.
This wide variet\ may seem as overwhelming
as the royal entryway; Young recommends
coining on multiple trips to realK absorb every
thing.
"That's one of the benefits ol haying a free
public museum," she said. "You (.111 come back
and see old favorites and see old things in new

ways. My single suggestion is that people try not
to see everything at once."
And students have been coming. According
to Young, students come both with Stanford
( lasses and on their own.
Freshman Bryant llelvey used the Cantor
Arts Center to find a piece of art to write about
for a Writing and (Critical I hinking paper.
"It was pretty easy to use because there were
maps, it was pretty quiet and well lit." said
I lelvey. "1 might go back someday."
Fhe Center's literature advertises student
memberships, available for $20, with the
promise that "a \ isit to the (ienter makes a great
date ... and the Rodin Sculpture Carden looks
really cool at night."
No matter where your interests lie, the Cen
ter lias something for everyone — peace, quiet,
art, and mavbe a chance for love.

The Cantor Arts Center is as impressive inside as it is outside.
