## A
						WEEKLY LOOK AT ARTS, ENTERTAINMENT AND STYLE AT STANFORD 
### ZACK KINNEY 
Backstage with
controversial
Nobel laureate
Dario Fo, an
overseas
student comes face
to face with a
uniauely Italian
brand of
outrageous
improvisation.

Tl lie first thing I noticed about Dario
\ Fo when I met him were his eyes.
They seemed to possess a magical
blue spark that flashed as he moved
them, hypnotically inviting the
onlooker to follow his gaze as he
looked around the room. Even at age
# 74, his entire body exuded a magnet
ic charisma, and I felt immediately
comfortable in his presence. I had
just witnessed the performance of his
• latest piece, "Lu Santo Jullare
9 Francesco," ("St. Francis, the Jester")
• at the Teatro Verdi in Pisa, Italy, and
• was backstage with the multi-talented
• actor and playwright in his dressing
• room.
Though still relatively unfamiliar to
American audiences, Fo has been
making headlines in Italy for several
decades with his often absurdly liber
» aland always comically satirical pro
• ductions, which have earned him the
• self-proclaimed title of "jester of the
• populace." And like a good jester —
• much in the same vein as his heroes,
the medieval jesters and commedia
dell'arte performers of Italy's Kith
and 17th centuries — Fo has ignored
the vehement outrage of Italian
authorities within both church and
« state and taken refuge in the welcom
• ing arms of the common folk.
t Especially important to Fo and the
• development of his unique style has
been the work of Ruzzante, an actor
and dramatist of the early 1500's
known for his hilariously vulgar

satires that
discussed
the hunger,
sex, poverty,
and violence that
he saw around
him. Like Ruz
zante, Fo's work
has been extreme-

ly controversial —
so controversial, in
fact, that the Vati
can has publicly
denounced the
author on many

occasions for his
sacrilegious
representations
of Christ, vari
ous popes, and
other religious
figures in his

plays. Fo's most
famous one-man
show, "Mistero buffo"

("Comic Mystery"), con
tains many "modified" ver-

sions of religious stories, including a
fictional encounter between the deca
dent and arrogant Pope Boniface VII
and Christ. The episode etuis with
Christ giving Boniface a series of
invisible kicks for his corruption.
But the Catholic Church is not the
only target of Fo's biting satire, as
other topics of his plays include the
Italian Mafia, Fascism, terrorism,
drug abuse, the Italian police, the
and the role of women and sexuality
in contemporary Italian society. Real
life political figures and controversial

social situations are often
thinly disguised and pre
sented on stage in Fo's
plays. Following the ter
rorist attack on t lie Banc a
Nazionale deH'Agricoltura
in Milan in 1971, Fo wrote

and produced one of his
most famous pieces, "Morte
accidentale di un anarchico"

("Accidental Death of an
Anarchist"), about an actual
murder thought to have been
organized by state officials that
