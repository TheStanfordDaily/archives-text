## A 						WEEKLY LOOK AT ARTS, ENTERTAINMENT AND STYLE AT STANFORD 
### ZACK KINNEY 
Backstage with
controversial
Nobel laureate
Dario Fo, an
overseas
student comes face
to face with a
uniauely Italian
brand of
outrageous
improvisation.

Tl lie first thing I noticed about Dario
\ Fo when I met him were his eyes.
They seemed to possess a magical
blue spark that flashed as he moved
them, hypnotically inviting the
onlooker to follow his gaze as he
looked around the room. Even at age
# 74, his entire body exuded a magnet
ic charisma, and I felt immediately
comfortable in his presence. I had
just witnessed the performance of his
• latest piece, "Lu Santo Jullare
9 Francesco," ("St. Francis, the Jester")
• at the Teatro Verdi in Pisa, Italy, and
• was backstage with the multi-talented
• actor and playwright in his dressing
• room.
Though still relatively unfamiliar to
American audiences, Fo has been
making headlines in Italy for several
decades with his often absurdly liber
» aland always comically satirical pro
• ductions, which have earned him the
• self-proclaimed title of "jester of the
• populace." And like a good jester —
• much in the same vein as his heroes,
the medieval jesters and commedia
dell'arte performers of Italy's Kith
and 17th centuries — Fo has ignored
the vehement outrage of Italian
authorities within both church and
« state and taken refuge in the welcom
• ing arms of the common folk.
t Especially important to Fo and the
• development of his unique style has
been the work of Ruzzante, an actor
and dramatist of the early 1500's
known for his hilariously vulgar

satires that
discussed
the hunger,
sex, poverty,
and violence that
he saw around
him. Like Ruz
zante, Fo's work
has been extreme-

ly controversial —
so controversial, in
fact, that the Vati
can has publicly
denounced the
author on many

occasions for his
sacrilegious
representations
of Christ, vari
ous popes, and
other religious
figures in his

plays. Fo's most
famous one-man
show, "Mistero buffo"

("Comic Mystery"), con
tains many "modified" ver-

sions of religious stories, including a
fictional encounter between the deca
dent and arrogant Pope Boniface VII
and Christ. The episode etuis with
Christ giving Boniface a series of
invisible kicks for his corruption.
But the Catholic Church is not the
only target of Fo's biting satire, as
other topics of his plays include the
Italian Mafia, Fascism, terrorism,
drug abuse, the Italian police, the
and the role of women and sexuality
in contemporary Italian society. Real
life political figures and controversial

social situations are often
thinly disguised and pre
sented on stage in Fo's
plays. Following the ter
rorist attack on t lie Banc a
Nazionale deH'Agricoltura
in Milan in 1971, Fo wrote

and produced one of his
most famous pieces, "Morte
accidentale di un anarchico"

("Accidental Death of an
Anarchist"), about an actual
murder thought to have been
organized by state officials that


NATACHA POGGIO/The Stanford Daily
was blamed on a left-wing political orga
nization.
For his art, Fo's plays have been cen
sored, he has been arrested by the
police, and he and his family have suf
fered threats and actual violence at the
hands of right-wing political groups.
Throughout this controversy, Fo has
continued to write and perform, and his
efforts were finally officially recognized
in 1997 with the Nobel Prize for Litera
ture. In the words of the Swedish
Academy, Fo was honored for "emulat
ing the jesters of the Middle Ages in
scourging authority and upholding the
dignity of the downtrodden."
Loved or hated, Fo has been an artist
who constantly strives to actively engage
his audiences in the ideas that he pre
sents. His style of acting involves a great
deal of improvisation, and he often com
pletely eliminates the traditional "fourth
wall" that separates actor and spectator
In speaking directly to his audiences or
even wandering among them during a
performance. Viewers are unable to
maintain a safe distance from his ideas,
and the works become exponentially
more powerful as the audience becomes
an integral part of the performance. For
Fo, comedy is the key to this process. As
he is fond of saying, "With laughter, the
mind is opened."
A master of language, Fo often per
forms in antique Italian dialects. This is
another characteristic that he has appro
priated from the medieval jesters, who
lived in a time before the Italian lan
guage had become standardized. These
traveling performers had to be extreme
1\ adept at using their bodies and voices
to tell their stories, as the words them
selves were often unintelligible to cer
tain audiences from different regions.
Fo is also a master of these techniques,
and can convey a great deal of meaning
even when speaking complete gibberish.
This is one reason that his performances
appeal to such a wide, international
audience. All told, Fo has written 70
plays that have been performed in more
than 54 countries around the world.
Fo's exposure in the United States has
been limited, though. He was denied an
entry visa into the United States for
many years because of his "extremist"
productions and his affiliations with cer
tain organizations, such as the Soccorso
Rosso, which offers aid to prison
inmates.
When he was finally allowed to per
form in the U.S. in 198(>, he publicly

thanked Ronald Regan for all
the controversial publicity.
Here in the Bay Area, the San
Francisco Mime Troupe has
translated and produced various
works by Fo, including "We
Won't Pay! We Won't Pay!," and
the American Conservatory The
atre in San Francisco generated
a great deal of controversy when
it performed a version of Fo's
" l iie Pope and the Witch" sever
al years ago.
In November 1998 at the
Marsh Theater in San Francisco,
I had my first taste of Fo's style of
theater when I saw a raucously
titillating play he had written
entitled, "Orgasmo Adulto
Escapes from the Zoo" (emphasis

on the "orgasm").
1 his particular work was an abbreviat
ed version of "Tutta casa, chiesa e letto,"
("All House, Church and Bed") which
had been written with a considerable
amount of input from the actor's long
time wife and collaborator, Franca
Rame.
Fo himself has only performed in the
United States a handful of times; thus I
was "forced" to go to Italy to see the
artist in the flesh. Through my involve
ment in the Stanford-in-Florence Pro
grain, I found myself at the perfor
mance of "St. Francis, the Jester."
Upon seating myself in the first level
balcony of Pisa's austere and elegantly
regal Teatro Verdi, I was pleased to see
that the curtain was already wide open.
This revealed a brightly lit stage with a
single, colorful backdrop hand-painted
by Fo himself, and two rows of college
age individuals seated in chairs directly
on the left and right sides of the stage.
T his, along with the stairs leading from
the center of the front of the stage right
down into the orchestra seats, fit per
fectly with Fo's reputation as an actor
most comfortable when directly interac t
ing with his audience, fearlessly impro
vising in 112 ront of a packed house.
And this Friday night house was
indeed packed. I had a relatively good
seat, but I sympathized with the individ
uals who had the misfortune to be seat
ed in the high balcony seats directly on
either side of the stage and would be
able to see the top of Fo's head but not
much else.
At precisely 9 p.m., without fanfare or
even a dimming of the house lights, the
maestro strolled leisurely out onto the
stage and was met by a huge round of
applause. After quieting the audience,
he first welcomed everyone to the show,
and then did something remarkably
generous. He had also noticed the hor
rible sight lines of the audience in the

upper balconies. "Hello up there!" lie
shouted, as he waved exaggerated!) to
these spectators. "Why don't you come
clown here with me where you can see
better?"
With this, he proceeded to invite all ol
the people in those seats to sit directh
on the stage with him. Fo offered his
own hand to help the spectators climb
the stairs to reach the stage, and onl\
when they were all coniforiabh settled
did he command the "man behind the
curtain" to lower the house lights. I lien
the real magic began.
Fo started his show with an informal
discussion of the pla) itself, relating his
reasons for choosing the topic of Saint
Francis and for presenting I tab 's most
revered saint — indeed, the official
patron saint of Italy — as a down.
Fo said he chose this portrayal because
it is the one that the saint used to
describe himself, claiming that he was
"the jester of (»od." I hough this contra
dicts the popular tradition that persists
even today of the saint as a quiet, alwa\s
peaceful friar, Fo described how his pla\
would instead present the lun-lo\ing.
down-like actions of the Saint through
"stories well-known and stories unfamil
iar" that had existed in oral form lor
hundreds of years.
At this point in the performance, Fo
took on the persona of Saint Francis
himself to relate one ol the stories from
his life, and the audience settled in to
enjoy the pure genius of his acting and
storytelling ability.
Dressed very simph in plain black
clothes and performing alone without
any props or set pieces, he held the
audience entranced with his physical
presence as he wove his wav through the
life of Saint ,Francis. As he spoke, he
humorous!) highlighted the events in
which Saint Francis clearl) played the
part of the fool, who appeared on the
surface to be absurd and idiotic but w ho

ill fact was the most knowledge
able person of all.
I lie first episode centered
around a speech that Sail it Fran
cis had delivered to the warring
citi/ens of Bologna. Thinking he
is actually in Naples, St. Francis
begins tlu* speech in the antique
dialect of Naples as it existed in
the 1200s when Saint Francis
was alive. When one of his audi
ence members informs him that
he is actually in Bologna, Saint
Francis is stunned. "You mean I
am not in Naples?" he asks. "Oh
my (i(xI! What will I do now?" As
he is unfamiliar with the Bolog
nese dialect, Francis decides that
he will continue speaking in
Napolese, which he had been

practicing for some time. Like
the jesters of Francis' time, he resorts to
mime to make 11 is points, as the audi
ence doesn't exactlv understand all of
the words he uses. Humorous as his
antics are, the meaning of his speech in
calling the Bolognese to peace is suc
cessful!) conveyed.
In another episode, Fo showed how
Francis would entertain his followers
with stories.
In a piece that is also contained in his
"Mistero hullo."' Saint Francis tells of the
Marriage at (lana. Saint Francis takes on
the persona of a drunken guest present
at Christ's miracle of the changing of
water into wine. B\ the end ol the piece,
Saint Franc is' fellow li iars are rolling on
the ground in laughter at this wonder
full\ entertaining tale.
All in all, the play was a tribute to the
human aspects of this legendan Saint,
whose revohiiionan teachings centered
around an appreciation for the natural
world, .md the rejection of material
wealth. Bevond this, the performance
was a magnificent example of Fo s
unique style of theater.
Alter the show, I found myself face to
lace with the man who is famous both as
esteemed Nobel Laureate and as the
people's clown. In person, Fo was gen
erous to a fault, refusing no one who
wanted a few minutes of his time. I lie
Nobel Laureate wore a satisfied smile on
his face as I was finally able to introduce
myself to him. "I'm sorn that I cannot
talk so much to \oii right now," he
politeh apologized, speaking in Italian.
"M\ throat is in a great deal of pain.
Bronchitis, the doctor tells me." Because
of this physical condition, Fo informed
me that it he would he more coherent
after a night of rest, and he invited me
to a conference that he would be giving
the next da\.
Returning to the theater the next
afternoon, 1 witnessed Fo, along with

three other researchers, elaborating on
his general style of performance as well
as the stories that he had presented in
I lis play. A natural performer, Fo man
aged to make a potentially dry topic
extremely entertaining, even resorting
to mime and song to make several of his
points. In his discussion of dialect, Fo
took on the persona of a Venetian oars
man to illustrate how many poetic tradi
tions got their rhyme and rhythm from
the repeated gestures of these and other
ancient workers.
After the conference, 1 asked Fo his
opinion of the condition of contempo
rary theater in Italy. "There is a great
emptiness," Fo said, in referring to the
world of Italian theater today. He care
fully explained how the situation in Ital
ian theater today is much different from
how it was a mere 25 years ago.
This period had been one of extreme
upheaval in Italy, with terrorist bomb
ings occurring almost daily and the fem
inist movement in full force. It was a
time when Italy was eager to discuss the
various topics that had been forbidden
in the public arena for so long, and the
theater was an ideal mechanism to con
vey these ideas.
Since then. Italy has stabilized, and the
revolutionary mentality has faded. In
these times of relative complacency, the
ater in Italy has fallen from its once pro
lific heights. "And Italian cinema is the
same," Fo says. Instead, the politics and
dynamics of society today generally
ignore the few works of the recent past
or present, and instead resurrect more
conservative works from the distant past
or import plays and films from other
countries.
"And why does this happen?" Fo asked
himself. "There is a specific reason due
in part to the authorities and those in
power who seek to cancel the recent
memory of the populace." The well
attended and politically supported per
fbrmances in Italy today consist primar
ily of works that do not evoke the tumult
of the immediate past or the present
problems in Italy.
"Certainly, there are a few young per
formers who focus on contemporary
Italian works," Fo acknowledges, "but
compared to twenty years ago, the situ
ation has changed completely." This is a
tragedy, according to Fo. "A theater, a
literature, an artistic expression that
does not speak for its own time has no
relevance."
In this vacuum of true spokesmen of
the conditions in Italy today, Fo clearly
stands out as the exception. There
exists neither smoke nor mirrors for Fo.
This wizard is the real thing, telling it
like- it is, in a comical mode that all can
understand and all will remember.

Though still relatively unfamiliar to
American audiences, Fo has been
making headlines in Italy for several
decades with his often absurdly liber

• ductions, which have earned him the

satires that
discussed
the hunger,

has been extreme-

so controversial, in
fact, that the Vati

denounced the
author on many

occasions for his
sacrilegious
representations
of Christ, vari
ous popes, and
other religious
figures in his

plays. Fo's most
famous one-man
show, "Mistero buffo"

("Comic Mystery"), con
tains many "modified" ver-

sions of religious stories, including a
fictional encounter between the deca
dent and arrogant Pope Boniface VII
and Christ. The episode etuis with
Christ giving Boniface a series of
invisible kicks for his corruption.
But the Catholic Church is not the
only target of Fo's biting satire, as
other topics of his plays include the
Italian Mafia, Fascism, terrorism,
drug abuse, the Italian police, the
and the role of women and sexuality
in contemporary Italian society. Real
life political figures and controversial

social situations are often
thinly disguised and pre
sented on stage in Fo's
plays. Following the ter
rorist attack on t lie Banc a
Nazionale deH'Agricoltura
in Milan in 1971, Fo wrote

and produced one of his
most famous pieces, "Morte
accidentale di un anarchico"

("Accidental Death of an
Anarchist"), about an actual
murder thought to have been
organized by state officials that


NATACHA POGGIO/The Stanford Daily
was blamed on a left-wing political orga
nization.
For his art, Fo's plays have been cen
sored, he has been arrested by the
police, and he and his family have suf
fered threats and actual violence at the
hands of right-wing political groups.
Throughout this controversy, Fo has
continued to write and perform, and his
efforts were finally officially recognized
in 1997 with the Nobel Prize for Litera
ture. In the words of the Swedish
Academy, Fo was honored for "emulat
ing the jesters of the Middle Ages in
scourging authority and upholding the
dignity of the downtrodden."
Loved or hated, Fo has been an artist
who constantly strives to actively engage
his audiences in the ideas that he pre
sents. His style of acting involves a great
deal of improvisation, and he often com
pletely eliminates the traditional "fourth
wall" that separates actor and spectator
In speaking directly to his audiences or
even wandering among them during a
performance. Viewers are unable to
maintain a safe distance from his ideas,
and the works become exponentially
more powerful as the audience becomes
an integral part of the performance. For
Fo, comedy is the key to this process. As
he is fond of saying, "With laughter, the
mind is opened."
A master of language, Fo often per
forms in antique Italian dialects. This is
another characteristic that he has appro
priated from the medieval jesters, who
lived in a time before the Italian lan
guage had become standardized. These
traveling performers had to be extreme
1\ adept at using their bodies and voices
to tell their stories, as the words them
selves were often unintelligible to cer
tain audiences from different regions.
Fo is also a master of these techniques,
and can convey a great deal of meaning
even when speaking complete gibberish.
This is one reason that his performances
appeal to such a wide, international
audience. All told, Fo has written 70
plays that have been performed in more
than 54 countries around the world.
Fo's exposure in the United States has
been limited, though. He was denied an
entry visa into the United States for
many years because of his "extremist"
productions and his affiliations with cer
tain organizations, such as the Soccorso
Rosso, which offers aid to prison
inmates.
When he was finally allowed to per
form in the U.S. in 198(>, he publicly

thanked Ronald Regan for all
the controversial publicity.
Here in the Bay Area, the San
Francisco Mime Troupe has
translated and produced various
works by Fo, including "We
Won't Pay! We Won't Pay!," and
the American Conservatory The
atre in San Francisco generated
a great deal of controversy when
it performed a version of Fo's
" l iie Pope and the Witch" sever
al years ago.
In November 1998 at the
Marsh Theater in San Francisco,
I had my first taste of Fo's style of
theater when I saw a raucously
titillating play he had written
entitled, "Orgasmo Adulto
Escapes from the Zoo" (emphasis

on the "orgasm").
1 his particular work was an abbreviat
ed version of "Tutta casa, chiesa e letto,"
("All House, Church and Bed") which
had been written with a considerable
amount of input from the actor's long
time wife and collaborator, Franca
Rame.
Fo himself has only performed in the
United States a handful of times; thus I
was "forced" to go to Italy to see the
artist in the flesh. Through my involve
ment in the Stanford-in-Florence Pro
grain, I found myself at the perfor
mance of "St. Francis, the Jester."
Upon seating myself in the first level
balcony of Pisa's austere and elegantly
regal Teatro Verdi, I was pleased to see
that the curtain was already wide open.
This revealed a brightly lit stage with a
single, colorful backdrop hand-painted
by Fo himself, and two rows of college
age individuals seated in chairs directly
on the left and right sides of the stage.
T his, along with the stairs leading from
the center of the front of the stage right
down into the orchestra seats, fit per
fectly with Fo's reputation as an actor
most comfortable when directly interac t
ing with his audience, fearlessly impro
vising in 112 ront of a packed house.
And this Friday night house was
indeed packed. I had a relatively good
seat, but I sympathized with the individ
uals who had the misfortune to be seat
ed in the high balcony seats directly on
either side of the stage and would be
able to see the top of Fo's head but not
much else.
At precisely 9 p.m., without fanfare or
even a dimming of the house lights, the
maestro strolled leisurely out onto the
stage and was met by a huge round of
applause. After quieting the audience,
he first welcomed everyone to the show,
and then did something remarkably
generous. He had also noticed the hor
rible sight lines of the audience in the

upper balconies. "Hello up there!" lie
shouted, as he waved exaggerated!) to
these spectators. "Why don't you come
clown here with me where you can see
better?"
With this, he proceeded to invite all ol
the people in those seats to sit directh
on the stage with him. Fo offered his
own hand to help the spectators climb
the stairs to reach the stage, and onl\
when they were all coniforiabh settled
did he command the "man behind the
curtain" to lower the house lights. I lien
the real magic began.
Fo started his show with an informal
discussion of the pla) itself, relating his
reasons for choosing the topic of Saint
Francis and for presenting I tab 's most
revered saint — indeed, the official
patron saint of Italy — as a down.
Fo said he chose this portrayal because
it is the one that the saint used to
describe himself, claiming that he was
"the jester of (»od." I hough this contra
dicts the popular tradition that persists
even today of the saint as a quiet, alwa\s
peaceful friar, Fo described how his pla\
would instead present the lun-lo\ing.
down-like actions of the Saint through
"stories well-known and stories unfamil
iar" that had existed in oral form lor
hundreds of years.
At this point in the performance, Fo
took on the persona of Saint Francis
himself to relate one ol the stories from
his life, and the audience settled in to
enjoy the pure genius of his acting and
storytelling ability.
Dressed very simph in plain black
clothes and performing alone without
any props or set pieces, he held the
audience entranced with his physical
presence as he wove his wav through the
life of Saint ,Francis. As he spoke, he
humorous!) highlighted the events in
which Saint Francis clearl) played the
part of the fool, who appeared on the
surface to be absurd and idiotic but w ho

ill fact was the most knowledge
able person of all.
I lie first episode centered
around a speech that Sail it Fran
cis had delivered to the warring
citi/ens of Bologna. Thinking he
is actually in Naples, St. Francis
begins tlu* speech in the antique
dialect of Naples as it existed in
the 1200s when Saint Francis
was alive. When one of his audi
ence members informs him that
he is actually in Bologna, Saint
Francis is stunned. "You mean I
am not in Naples?" he asks. "Oh
my (i(xI! What will I do now?" As
he is unfamiliar with the Bolog
nese dialect, Francis decides that
he will continue speaking in
Napolese, which he had been

practicing for some time. Like
the jesters of Francis' time, he resorts to
mime to make 11 is points, as the audi
ence doesn't exactlv understand all of
the words he uses. Humorous as his
antics are, the meaning of his speech in
calling the Bolognese to peace is suc
cessful!) conveyed.
In another episode, Fo showed how
Francis would entertain his followers
with stories.
In a piece that is also contained in his
"Mistero hullo."' Saint Francis tells of the
Marriage at (lana. Saint Francis takes on
the persona of a drunken guest present
at Christ's miracle of the changing of
water into wine. B\ the end ol the piece,
Saint Franc is' fellow li iars are rolling on
the ground in laughter at this wonder
full\ entertaining tale.
All in all, the play was a tribute to the
human aspects of this legendan Saint,
whose revohiiionan teachings centered
around an appreciation for the natural
world, .md the rejection of material
wealth. Bevond this, the performance
was a magnificent example of Fo s
unique style of theater.
Alter the show, I found myself face to
lace with the man who is famous both as
esteemed Nobel Laureate and as the
people's clown. In person, Fo was gen
erous to a fault, refusing no one who
wanted a few minutes of his time. I lie
Nobel Laureate wore a satisfied smile on
his face as I was finally able to introduce
myself to him. "I'm sorn that I cannot
talk so much to \oii right now," he
politeh apologized, speaking in Italian.
"M\ throat is in a great deal of pain.
Bronchitis, the doctor tells me." Because
of this physical condition, Fo informed
me that it he would he more coherent
after a night of rest, and he invited me
to a conference that he would be giving
the next da\.
Returning to the theater the next
afternoon, 1 witnessed Fo, along with

three other researchers, elaborating on
his general style of performance as well
as the stories that he had presented in
I lis play. A natural performer, Fo man
aged to make a potentially dry topic
extremely entertaining, even resorting
to mime and song to make several of his
points. In his discussion of dialect, Fo
took on the persona of a Venetian oars
man to illustrate how many poetic tradi
tions got their rhyme and rhythm from
the repeated gestures of these and other
ancient workers.
After the conference, 1 asked Fo his
opinion of the condition of contempo
rary theater in Italy. "There is a great
emptiness," Fo said, in referring to the
world of Italian theater today. He care
fully explained how the situation in Ital
ian theater today is much different from
how it was a mere 25 years ago.
This period had been one of extreme
upheaval in Italy, with terrorist bomb
ings occurring almost daily and the fem
inist movement in full force. It was a
time when Italy was eager to discuss the
various topics that had been forbidden
in the public arena for so long, and the
theater was an ideal mechanism to con
vey these ideas.
Since then. Italy has stabilized, and the
revolutionary mentality has faded. In
these times of relative complacency, the
ater in Italy has fallen from its once pro
lific heights. "And Italian cinema is the
same," Fo says. Instead, the politics and
dynamics of society today generally
ignore the few works of the recent past
or present, and instead resurrect more
conservative works from the distant past
or import plays and films from other
countries.
"And why does this happen?" Fo asked
himself. "There is a specific reason due
in part to the authorities and those in
power who seek to cancel the recent
memory of the populace." The well
attended and politically supported per
fbrmances in Italy today consist primar
ily of works that do not evoke the tumult
of the immediate past or the present
problems in Italy.
"Certainly, there are a few young per
formers who focus on contemporary
Italian works," Fo acknowledges, "but
compared to twenty years ago, the situ
ation has changed completely." This is a
tragedy, according to Fo. "A theater, a
literature, an artistic expression that
does not speak for its own time has no
relevance."
In this vacuum of true spokesmen of
the conditions in Italy today, Fo clearly
stands out as the exception. There
exists neither smoke nor mirrors for Fo.
This wizard is the real thing, telling it
like- it is, in a comical mode that all can
understand and all will remember.

Dario Fo, an
overseas
student comes face

uniauely Italian
brand of
outrageous
improvisation.

Tl lie first thing I noticed about Dario
\ Fo when I met him were his eyes.
They seemed to possess a magical
blue spark that flashed as he moved
them, hypnotically inviting the
onlooker to follow his gaze as he
looked around the room. Even at age
# 74, his entire body exuded a magnet

and violence that

fact, that the Vati
can has publicly
denounced the
author on many

occasions for his
sacrilegious
representations
of Christ, vari

other religious
figures in his

plays. Fo's most
famous one-man
show, "Mistero buffo"

("Comic Mystery"), con
tains many "modified" ver-

sions of religious stories, including a
fictional encounter between the deca
dent and arrogant Pope Boniface VII
and Christ. The episode etuis with
Christ giving Boniface a series of
invisible kicks for his corruption.
But the Catholic Church is not the
only target of Fo's biting satire, as
other topics of his plays include the
Italian Mafia, Fascism, terrorism,
drug abuse, the Italian police, the
and the role of women and sexuality
in contemporary Italian society. Real
life political figures and controversial

social situations are often
thinly disguised and pre
sented on stage in Fo's
plays. Following the ter
rorist attack on t lie Banc a
Nazionale deH'Agricoltura
in Milan in 1971, Fo wrote

and produced one of his
most famous pieces, "Morte
accidentale di un anarchico"

("Accidental Death of an
Anarchist"), about an actual
murder thought to have been
organized by state officials that


NATACHA POGGIO/The Stanford Daily
was blamed on a left-wing political orga
nization.
For his art, Fo's plays have been cen
sored, he has been arrested by the
police, and he and his family have suf
fered threats and actual violence at the
hands of right-wing political groups.
Throughout this controversy, Fo has
continued to write and perform, and his
efforts were finally officially recognized
in 1997 with the Nobel Prize for Litera
ture. In the words of the Swedish
Academy, Fo was honored for "emulat
ing the jesters of the Middle Ages in
scourging authority and upholding the
dignity of the downtrodden."
Loved or hated, Fo has been an artist
who constantly strives to actively engage
his audiences in the ideas that he pre
sents. His style of acting involves a great
deal of improvisation, and he often com
pletely eliminates the traditional "fourth
wall" that separates actor and spectator
In speaking directly to his audiences or
even wandering among them during a
performance. Viewers are unable to
maintain a safe distance from his ideas,
and the works become exponentially
more powerful as the audience becomes
an integral part of the performance. For
Fo, comedy is the key to this process. As
he is fond of saying, "With laughter, the
mind is opened."
A master of language, Fo often per
forms in antique Italian dialects. This is
another characteristic that he has appro
priated from the medieval jesters, who
lived in a time before the Italian lan
guage had become standardized. These
traveling performers had to be extreme
1\ adept at using their bodies and voices
to tell their stories, as the words them
selves were often unintelligible to cer
tain audiences from different regions.
Fo is also a master of these techniques,
and can convey a great deal of meaning
even when speaking complete gibberish.
This is one reason that his performances
appeal to such a wide, international
audience. All told, Fo has written 70
plays that have been performed in more
than 54 countries around the world.
Fo's exposure in the United States has
been limited, though. He was denied an
entry visa into the United States for
many years because of his "extremist"
productions and his affiliations with cer
tain organizations, such as the Soccorso
Rosso, which offers aid to prison
inmates.
When he was finally allowed to per
form in the U.S. in 198(>, he publicly

thanked Ronald Regan for all
the controversial publicity.
Here in the Bay Area, the San
Francisco Mime Troupe has
translated and produced various
works by Fo, including "We
Won't Pay! We Won't Pay!," and
the American Conservatory The
atre in San Francisco generated
a great deal of controversy when
it performed a version of Fo's
" l iie Pope and the Witch" sever
al years ago.
In November 1998 at the
Marsh Theater in San Francisco,
I had my first taste of Fo's style of
theater when I saw a raucously
titillating play he had written
entitled, "Orgasmo Adulto
Escapes from the Zoo" (emphasis

on the "orgasm").
1 his particular work was an abbreviat
ed version of "Tutta casa, chiesa e letto,"
("All House, Church and Bed") which
had been written with a considerable
amount of input from the actor's long
time wife and collaborator, Franca
Rame.
Fo himself has only performed in the
United States a handful of times; thus I
was "forced" to go to Italy to see the
artist in the flesh. Through my involve
ment in the Stanford-in-Florence Pro
grain, I found myself at the perfor
mance of "St. Francis, the Jester."
Upon seating myself in the first level
balcony of Pisa's austere and elegantly
regal Teatro Verdi, I was pleased to see
that the curtain was already wide open.
This revealed a brightly lit stage with a
single, colorful backdrop hand-painted
by Fo himself, and two rows of college
age individuals seated in chairs directly
on the left and right sides of the stage.
T his, along with the stairs leading from
the center of the front of the stage right
down into the orchestra seats, fit per
fectly with Fo's reputation as an actor
most comfortable when directly interac t
ing with his audience, fearlessly impro
vising in 112 ront of a packed house.
And this Friday night house was
indeed packed. I had a relatively good
seat, but I sympathized with the individ
uals who had the misfortune to be seat
ed in the high balcony seats directly on
either side of the stage and would be
able to see the top of Fo's head but not
much else.
At precisely 9 p.m., without fanfare or
even a dimming of the house lights, the
maestro strolled leisurely out onto the
stage and was met by a huge round of
applause. After quieting the audience,
he first welcomed everyone to the show,
and then did something remarkably
generous. He had also noticed the hor
rible sight lines of the audience in the

upper balconies. "Hello up there!" lie
shouted, as he waved exaggerated!) to
these spectators. "Why don't you come
clown here with me where you can see
better?"
With this, he proceeded to invite all ol
the people in those seats to sit directh
on the stage with him. Fo offered his
own hand to help the spectators climb
the stairs to reach the stage, and onl\
when they were all coniforiabh settled
did he command the "man behind the
curtain" to lower the house lights. I lien
the real magic began.
Fo started his show with an informal
discussion of the pla) itself, relating his
reasons for choosing the topic of Saint
Francis and for presenting I tab 's most
revered saint — indeed, the official
patron saint of Italy — as a down.
Fo said he chose this portrayal because
it is the one that the saint used to
describe himself, claiming that he was
"the jester of (»od." I hough this contra
dicts the popular tradition that persists
even today of the saint as a quiet, alwa\s
peaceful friar, Fo described how his pla\
would instead present the lun-lo\ing.
down-like actions of the Saint through
"stories well-known and stories unfamil
iar" that had existed in oral form lor
hundreds of years.
At this point in the performance, Fo
took on the persona of Saint Francis
himself to relate one ol the stories from
his life, and the audience settled in to
enjoy the pure genius of his acting and
storytelling ability.
Dressed very simph in plain black
clothes and performing alone without
any props or set pieces, he held the
audience entranced with his physical
presence as he wove his wav through the
life of Saint ,Francis. As he spoke, he
humorous!) highlighted the events in
which Saint Francis clearl) played the
part of the fool, who appeared on the
surface to be absurd and idiotic but w ho

ill fact was the most knowledge
able person of all.
I lie first episode centered
around a speech that Sail it Fran
cis had delivered to the warring
citi/ens of Bologna. Thinking he
is actually in Naples, St. Francis
begins tlu* speech in the antique
dialect of Naples as it existed in
the 1200s when Saint Francis
was alive. When one of his audi
ence members informs him that
he is actually in Bologna, Saint
Francis is stunned. "You mean I
am not in Naples?" he asks. "Oh
my (i(xI! What will I do now?" As
he is unfamiliar with the Bolog
nese dialect, Francis decides that
he will continue speaking in
Napolese, which he had been

practicing for some time. Like
the jesters of Francis' time, he resorts to
mime to make 11 is points, as the audi
ence doesn't exactlv understand all of
the words he uses. Humorous as his
antics are, the meaning of his speech in
calling the Bolognese to peace is suc
cessful!) conveyed.
In another episode, Fo showed how
Francis would entertain his followers
with stories.
In a piece that is also contained in his
"Mistero hullo."' Saint Francis tells of the
Marriage at (lana. Saint Francis takes on
the persona of a drunken guest present
at Christ's miracle of the changing of
water into wine. B\ the end ol the piece,
Saint Franc is' fellow li iars are rolling on
the ground in laughter at this wonder
full\ entertaining tale.
All in all, the play was a tribute to the
human aspects of this legendan Saint,
whose revohiiionan teachings centered
around an appreciation for the natural
world, .md the rejection of material
wealth. Bevond this, the performance
was a magnificent example of Fo s
unique style of theater.
Alter the show, I found myself face to
lace with the man who is famous both as
esteemed Nobel Laureate and as the
people's clown. In person, Fo was gen
erous to a fault, refusing no one who
wanted a few minutes of his time. I lie
Nobel Laureate wore a satisfied smile on
his face as I was finally able to introduce
myself to him. "I'm sorn that I cannot
talk so much to \oii right now," he
politeh apologized, speaking in Italian.
"M\ throat is in a great deal of pain.
Bronchitis, the doctor tells me." Because
of this physical condition, Fo informed
me that it he would he more coherent
after a night of rest, and he invited me
to a conference that he would be giving
the next da\.
Returning to the theater the next
afternoon, 1 witnessed Fo, along with

three other researchers, elaborating on
his general style of performance as well
as the stories that he had presented in
I lis play. A natural performer, Fo man
aged to make a potentially dry topic
extremely entertaining, even resorting
to mime and song to make several of his
points. In his discussion of dialect, Fo
took on the persona of a Venetian oars
man to illustrate how many poetic tradi
tions got their rhyme and rhythm from
the repeated gestures of these and other
ancient workers.
After the conference, 1 asked Fo his
opinion of the condition of contempo
rary theater in Italy. "There is a great
emptiness," Fo said, in referring to the
world of Italian theater today. He care
fully explained how the situation in Ital
ian theater today is much different from
how it was a mere 25 years ago.
This period had been one of extreme
upheaval in Italy, with terrorist bomb
ings occurring almost daily and the fem
inist movement in full force. It was a
time when Italy was eager to discuss the
various topics that had been forbidden
in the public arena for so long, and the
theater was an ideal mechanism to con
vey these ideas.
Since then. Italy has stabilized, and the
revolutionary mentality has faded. In
these times of relative complacency, the
ater in Italy has fallen from its once pro
lific heights. "And Italian cinema is the
same," Fo says. Instead, the politics and
dynamics of society today generally
ignore the few works of the recent past
or present, and instead resurrect more
conservative works from the distant past
or import plays and films from other
countries.
"And why does this happen?" Fo asked
himself. "There is a specific reason due
in part to the authorities and those in
power who seek to cancel the recent
memory of the populace." The well
attended and politically supported per
fbrmances in Italy today consist primar
ily of works that do not evoke the tumult
of the immediate past or the present
problems in Italy.
"Certainly, there are a few young per
formers who focus on contemporary
Italian works," Fo acknowledges, "but
compared to twenty years ago, the situ
ation has changed completely." This is a
tragedy, according to Fo. "A theater, a
literature, an artistic expression that
does not speak for its own time has no
relevance."
In this vacuum of true spokesmen of
the conditions in Italy today, Fo clearly
stands out as the exception. There
exists neither smoke nor mirrors for Fo.
This wizard is the real thing, telling it
like- it is, in a comical mode that all can
understand and all will remember.

Pisa, Italy.
Backstage with
controversial
Nobel laureate
Dario Fo, an
overseas
student comes face
to face with a
uniauely Italian
brand of
outrageous
improvisation.

Tl lie first thing I noticed about Dario
\ Fo when I met him were his eyes.
They seemed to possess a magical
blue spark that flashed as he moved
them, hypnotically inviting the
onlooker to follow his gaze as he
looked around the room. Even at age
# 74, his entire body exuded a magnet
ic charisma, and I felt immediately
comfortable in his presence. I had
just witnessed the performance of his
• latest piece, "Lu Santo Jullare
9 Francesco," ("St. Francis, the Jester")
• at the Teatro Verdi in Pisa, Italy, and
• was backstage with the multi-talented
• actor and playwright in his dressing
• room.
Though still relatively unfamiliar to
American audiences, Fo has been
making headlines in Italy for several
decades with his often absurdly liber
» aland always comically satirical pro
• ductions, which have earned him the
• self-proclaimed title of "jester of the
• populace." And like a good jester —
• much in the same vein as his heroes,
the medieval jesters and commedia
dell'arte performers of Italy's Kith
and 17th centuries — Fo has ignored
the vehement outrage of Italian
authorities within both church and
« state and taken refuge in the welcom
• ing arms of the common folk.
t Especially important to Fo and the
• development of his unique style has
been the work of Ruzzante, an actor
and dramatist of the early 1500's
known for his hilariously vulgar

satires that
discussed
the hunger,
sex, poverty,
and violence that
he saw around
him. Like Ruz
