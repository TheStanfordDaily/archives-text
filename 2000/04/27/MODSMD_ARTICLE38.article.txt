# Author tells the tale of two years living in a tree

### RENEE CANADA STAFF WRITER 
After surviving a horrible car accident that put
her in intensive therapy for almost a year, Julia
"Butterfly" Hill resolved to change her life. She
wanted to follow a more spiritual path that would
allow her to become emotionally and spiritually
whole, as well as physically whole. In search of a
spiritual place to provide her with a sense of pur
pose, Hill found herself overwhelmed by the beau
ty of the ancient, Headwaters Redwood forest in
Humboldt County, California.
Unfortunately, Pacific Lumber and the Maxxain
Corporation had already claimed the forest for
clear-cutting to provide lumber for housing and
furniture. Trees thousands of years old were being
felled by chain saws, causing mudslides, which
wiped out hillsides and neighboring towns.
Activists from Earth First! were performing tree-sits
to protest the logging, installing people around the
clock on a platform in a tree to hopefully prevent
that tree and surrounding areas from being cut
down.
When Hill, who's always been a supporter of the
underdog, realized the threat facing the forest that
gave her spiritual strength and hope, she prayed
for guidance. "If I'm truly meant to come back and
fight for these trees out here, please help me know
what I'm meant to do, and use me as a vessel," Hill
recalls praying in her book, "The Legacy of Luna."
An answer to her prayers came when she, at the
age of 21, was asked to sit in "Luna," a gigantic red
wood tree that was the "Beacon of Hope" for the
Earth First! campaign. What was originally sup
posed to be a three week sit-in turned into two
years of living in the tree. According to Hill, she felt
she couldn't resist the call when a voice said to her,
"Julia, if you walk away, you'll never live with your
self."
"I came out West looking for purpose," Hill said
in a recent interview with the Daily. "I found
myself called to a life of service. . . I felt that I had
to do something with my body to help people
understand that the massive onslaught and human
disrespect for the environment is affecting critical
forests and watersheds," Hill said, mysteriously

slipping into a formal, British accent. Later, Hill
revealed that "the beauty of the redwoods touched
me so deeply, in a way our corporate society
doesn't." She swore to remain in the tree until she
had done everything she could to protect these
areas and to change consciousness about these
environmental issues.
