# Author tells the tale of two years living in a tree
## 
### RENEE CANADA STAFF WRITER 
After surviving a horrible car accident that put
her in intensive therapy for almost a year, Julia
"Butterfly" Hill resolved to change her life. She
wanted to follow a more spiritual path that would
allow her to become emotionally and spiritually
whole, as well as physically whole. In search of a
spiritual place to provide her with a sense of pur
pose, Hill found herself overwhelmed by the beau
ty of the ancient, Headwaters Redwood forest in
Humboldt County, California.
Unfortunately, Pacific Lumber and the Maxxain
Corporation had already claimed the forest for
clear-cutting to provide lumber for housing and
furniture. Trees thousands of years old were being
felled by chain saws, causing mudslides, which
wiped out hillsides and neighboring towns.
Activists from Earth First! were performing tree-sits
to protest the logging, installing people around the
clock on a platform in a tree to hopefully prevent
that tree and surrounding areas from being cut
down.
When Hill, who's always been a supporter of the
underdog, realized the threat facing the forest that
gave her spiritual strength and hope, she prayed
for guidance. "If I'm truly meant to come back and
fight for these trees out here, please help me know
what I'm meant to do, and use me as a vessel," Hill
recalls praying in her book, "The Legacy of Luna."
An answer to her prayers came when she, at the
age of 21, was asked to sit in "Luna," a gigantic red
wood tree that was the "Beacon of Hope" for the
Earth First! campaign. What was originally sup
posed to be a three week sit-in turned into two
years of living in the tree. According to Hill, she felt
she couldn't resist the call when a voice said to her,
"Julia, if you walk away, you'll never live with your
self."
"I came out West looking for purpose," Hill said
in a recent interview with the Daily. "I found
myself called to a life of service. . . I felt that I had
to do something with my body to help people
understand that the massive onslaught and human
disrespect for the environment is affecting critical
forests and watersheds," Hill said, mysteriously

slipping into a formal, British accent. Later, Hill
revealed that "the beauty of the redwoods touched
me so deeply, in a way our corporate society
doesn't." She swore to remain in the tree until she
had done everything she could to protect these
areas and to change consciousness about these
environmental issues.

Through the windy, cold rains ol El Ni o
and the bitter snowstorms of La Ni'a,
through helicopter harassment and a 10-day
siege by company security, Hill's time in
Luna was a difficult, and sometimes painful,
experience. When asked what were the hard
est parts emotionally and physically about liv
ing in a tree, Hill laughed and said, "Every
thing!"
Two years without a shower or toilet would
be a dreadful shock to tlu* system for anyone.
With limited food supplies. Hill's diet of
nuts, granola, and fruit was quite similar to
that of a squirrel's, and squirrels often tried
to steal from her stash. " I lie* biggest thing [1
did to adjust] was letting go â€” everything
was attachments to comfort and security and
safety," Hill said. "In the forest, I was sur
rounded by massive violence and destruc
tion, and it was a challenge to transform, to
let go."
In her book, Hill recalls a dreadful storm
during El Ni'o, when she thought the wind
would knock her out of the 200-fbot tree.
Hill reacted with fear, tensing her body, and
only felt more in danger. 1 his is one of many
sequences where Hill claims Luna spoke to
her; during the storm, Luna told lier to think
of how trees bend and bow with the wind so
that they won't break. That advice allowed
Hill to relax and give in to the wind, surviv
ing the storm. Hill told me through prayer
and "bonding with Luna, she was able to get
over her terror of living in the tree and carry
on with the tasks at hand.
While my mind filled with visions of Hill
climbing the tree like a monkey and writing
poetry in the pale moonlight, Hill assured me
that her life in the tree was 110 romantic fan
tasy. "I was basically part of a campaign," Hill
said. "I worked all day, everyday. My office
was my tree, where I spent six to eight hours
a day on the phone, doing interviews and
speaking to schools ... I also wrote about 100
letters a week."
Through two years of physical activism, Hill
found herself "making the world aware and
reaching [it] in a way I never could have
imagined." Though Hill has been criticized
for living in Luna as a publicity stunt, she
claims that she put her life on the line because
not enough was being clone through the

more "rational" means of working within the
system.
Hill finally came down from Luna on
December 18, 1999, when Maxxam Corpora
tion signed the Luna Preservation Agreement
and Deed of Covenant, which protects Luna
and the three acres of land surrounding it.
After two years of living in a redwood tree,
Hill, now 24, is finally back on solid ground.
Her newly released book, "Legacy of Luna,"
chronicles the long, difficult years Hill spent
living in the tree. Now, with a nationwide
book tour and speaking engagements at
schools, festivals and rallies, it's also been a
stressful homecoming.
"I knew I'd be coming down to a whirlwind,
but 1 didn't realize I'd be coming down to a
tornado," Hill said. Whether she's talking
about the media frenzy surrounding her or
the overload of the senses after living two
years in a redwood forest is hard to say for
sure. Yet, while her campaign to save thou
sand-year-old redwood trees from the log
ging company was in many ways a success,
her fight is long from over.
"I see this as just one piece in the puzzle,"
Hill said about her tree sit-in. "I believe that
every environmental and social issue is
linked." 111 today's corporate society, where
everything is "bigger, better, faster, now,"
Hill says we don't see an honoring of com
passion and love, which leads to this imbal
ance of man and nature. "I'm appalled at
how much this is a disposable society that we
live in," Hill said, urging people to change
that. "When you go to the grocery store and
they ask you, 'Paper or plastic?" say, 'Neither,'
because you've brought your own cloth bags
for your food."
Hill also wanted to make sure that peo pie
were aware of the battle she fought so that
her book wouldn't require a destruction of a
forest. "[The company that printed this]
treats the forest with respect and love," Hill
said, claiming that 110 chemicals or clear-cut
ting are used in the "completely intact ecosys
tem" from which the paper comes. "The
Legacy of Luna" is printed on paper that is
30 percent post-consumer waste and 70 per
cent Smart Wood Certified. "This book is an
actual embodiment of the struggles I went
through [to save Luna and other redwood
trees]," Hill said.
She encourages all of us to take action
against social injustices, using whatever gilts
we have, whether we're writers or doc tors or
lawyers. Hill said, "Change can only happen
when people decide enough is enough."

Through the windy, cold rains ol El Ni o
and the bitter snowstorms of La Ni'a,
through helicopter harassment and a 10-day
siege by company security, Hill's time in
Luna was a difficult, and sometimes painful,
experience. When asked what were the hard
est parts emotionally and physically about liv
ing in a tree, Hill laughed and said, "Every
thing!"
Two years without a shower or toilet would
be a dreadful shock to tlu* system for anyone.
With limited food supplies. Hill's diet of
nuts, granola, and fruit was quite similar to
that of a squirrel's, and squirrels often tried
to steal from her stash. " I lie* biggest thing [1
did to adjust] was letting go â€” everything
was attachments to comfort and security and
safety," Hill said. "In the forest, I was sur
rounded by massive violence and destruc
tion, and it was a challenge to transform, to
let go."
In her book, Hill recalls a dreadful storm
during El Ni'o, when she thought the wind
would knock her out of the 200-fbot tree.
Hill reacted with fear, tensing her body, and
only felt more in danger. 1 his is one of many
sequences where Hill claims Luna spoke to
her; during the storm, Luna told lier to think
of how trees bend and bow with the wind so
that they won't break. That advice allowed
Hill to relax and give in to the wind, surviv
ing the storm. Hill told me through prayer
and "bonding with Luna, she was able to get
over her terror of living in the tree and carry
on with the tasks at hand.
While my mind filled with visions of Hill
climbing the tree like a monkey and writing
poetry in the pale moonlight, Hill assured me
that her life in the tree was 110 romantic fan
tasy. "I was basically part of a campaign," Hill
said. "I worked all day, everyday. My office
was my tree, where I spent six to eight hours
a day on the phone, doing interviews and
speaking to schools ... I also wrote about 100
letters a week."
Through two years of physical activism, Hill
found herself "making the world aware and
reaching [it] in a way I never could have
imagined." Though Hill has been criticized
for living in Luna as a publicity stunt, she
claims that she put her life on the line because
not enough was being clone through the

more "rational" means of working within the
system.
Hill finally came down from Luna on
December 18, 1999, when Maxxam Corpora
tion signed the Luna Preservation Agreement
and Deed of Covenant, which protects Luna
and the three acres of land surrounding it.
After two years of living in a redwood tree,
Hill, now 24, is finally back on solid ground.
Her newly released book, "Legacy of Luna,"
chronicles the long, difficult years Hill spent
living in the tree. Now, with a nationwide
book tour and speaking engagements at
schools, festivals and rallies, it's also been a
stressful homecoming.
"I knew I'd be coming down to a whirlwind,
but 1 didn't realize I'd be coming down to a
tornado," Hill said. Whether she's talking
about the media frenzy surrounding her or
the overload of the senses after living two
years in a redwood forest is hard to say for
sure. Yet, while her campaign to save thou
sand-year-old redwood trees from the log
ging company was in many ways a success,
her fight is long from over.
"I see this as just one piece in the puzzle,"
Hill said about her tree sit-in. "I believe that
every environmental and social issue is
linked." 111 today's corporate society, where
everything is "bigger, better, faster, now,"
Hill says we don't see an honoring of com
passion and love, which leads to this imbal
ance of man and nature. "I'm appalled at
how much this is a disposable society that we
live in," Hill said, urging people to change
that. "When you go to the grocery store and
they ask you, 'Paper or plastic?" say, 'Neither,'
because you've brought your own cloth bags
for your food."
Hill also wanted to make sure that peo pie
were aware of the battle she fought so that
her book wouldn't require a destruction of a
forest. "[The company that printed this]
treats the forest with respect and love," Hill
said, claiming that 110 chemicals or clear-cut
ting are used in the "completely intact ecosys
tem" from which the paper comes. "The
Legacy of Luna" is printed on paper that is
30 percent post-consumer waste and 70 per
cent Smart Wood Certified. "This book is an
actual embodiment of the struggles I went
through [to save Luna and other redwood
trees]," Hill said.
She encourages all of us to take action
against social injustices, using whatever gilts
we have, whether we're writers or doc tors or
lawyers. Hill said, "Change can only happen
when people decide enough is enough."
After surviving a horrible car accident that put
her in intensive therapy for almost a year, Julia
"Butterfly" Hill resolved to change her life. She
wanted to follow a more spiritual path that would
allow her to become emotionally and spiritually
whole, as well as physically whole. In search of a
spiritual place to provide her with a sense of pur
pose, Hill found herself overwhelmed by the beau
ty of the ancient, Headwaters Redwood forest in
Humboldt County, California.
Unfortunately, Pacific Lumber and the Maxxain
Corporation had already claimed the forest for
clear-cutting to provide lumber for housing and
furniture. Trees thousands of years old were being
felled by chain saws, causing mudslides, which
wiped out hillsides and neighboring towns.
Activists from Earth First! were performing tree-sits
to protest the logging, installing people around the
clock on a platform in a tree to hopefully prevent
that tree and surrounding areas from being cut
down.
When Hill, who's always been a supporter of the
underdog, realized the threat facing the forest that
gave her spiritual strength and hope, she prayed
for guidance. "If I'm truly meant to come back and
fight for these trees out here, please help me know
what I'm meant to do, and use me as a vessel," Hill
recalls praying in her book, "The Legacy of Luna."
An answer to her prayers came when she, at the
age of 21, was asked to sit in "Luna," a gigantic red
wood tree that was the "Beacon of Hope" for the
Earth First! campaign. What was originally sup
posed to be a three week sit-in turned into two
years of living in the tree. According to Hill, she felt
she couldn't resist the call when a voice said to her,
"Julia, if you walk away, you'll never live with your
self."
"I came out West looking for purpose," Hill said
in a recent interview with the Daily. "I found
myself called to a life of service. . . I felt that I had
to do something with my body to help people
understand that the massive onslaught and human
disrespect for the environment is affecting critical
forests and watersheds," Hill said, mysteriously

slipping into a formal, British accent. Later, Hill
revealed that "the beauty of the redwoods touched
me so deeply, in a way our corporate society
doesn't." She swore to remain in the tree until she
had done everything she could to protect these
areas and to change consciousness about these
environmental issues.
