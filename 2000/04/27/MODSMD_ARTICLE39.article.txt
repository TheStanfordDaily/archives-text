After endless
months of work, the
Roble I healer is linal-

We Roll Along" is here

"Merrily" is an exu
berant and emotional
production hy a
group ol actors clearly
thrilled to he per
forming in this new
space. Senior Jennifer
(lliou discovered the
Sondheim musical in
high school and is liv
ing "a dream come
true" with the staging
of "Merrily" by Sta
ge One Productions,
of which she is a co
founder.

Hie show is a time machine containing the
composer / Ivricist duo of Franklin Shepard
and Charley Kringas, along with the women
in their lives. Shepard becomes ;i movie pro
ducer, while kringas si ill holds on to the
dream of getting their own musical to be .1
hit. As the show moves back in time, the
foundations of the duo's friendship are
revealed, as well as the tensions that lead to
the sobering opening scene. It is quite ;i
moralistic story, a statement on the ironic
unhappiness that earth-shattering success
can bring.
The ensemble c ast began Saturday's show
rather tentatively, with barely audible mini
solos, but
