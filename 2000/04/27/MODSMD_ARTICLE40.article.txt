# Finding rock's roots on another continent

### STEVEN RAPHAEL STAFF WRITER 
()n April 25, in celebration of the upcoming
South African Freedom Day, Berkeley-based
record label I'utuinayo World Music will release
two albums of African music. "South African I .em
ends" is a collection of music by some ol the most
influential South African musicians. "I loineland"
is the first new studio recording in six years liom
.i South African legend: renowned world musi
cian, ambassador, author, activist and actress
Mil i.nn Makeba.
It is difficult to think of a time when African
music was not vastly influential in America, both
on implicit and explicit levels. Reaching back .is
fai as the 19205, African Americans skilllulb
grafted \li ic an i h\thms onto Furopeaii instiii
incuts .iikl song forms to create the tini<|iic art
form known .is jazz. Since it was a part of tlieii
stolen heiitage, 11ic\ utilized African styles with
out need for justification.
In recent times, more artists have begun to rec
ognize the power and beaut) of African music. In
I ( .)<S7, I'aul Simon introduced South African
music to America and much of the world with his
C>i amllin winning album "(»raceland. Similarly,
199Ts "The I.ion King" soundtrack adapted
South All i( an music to a children's movie, gi\ ing
a whole new audience access to the music.
furthermore, modern groups like Arrested
Development and Rusted Root draw heavily on
tribal Afrit an beats and rhythmic chanting, using
various peicussion and nonsense syllables to
induce tlicit audiences to dame. A whole genera
tion of bands like these routinely dedicate entire
portions of their shows to rhythmic drum inter
act i<his.
Sadlv, this small sampling is the farthest most
.Americans have penetrated into the rich depths
ol South Alric an music. What's particularly iniei -
esting about this is that, in many cases, modern
clay African musicians are creating sounds that
aie remarkably similar to mainstream American
iniisii. Only, b\ adding tlicit own touch, the
South Africans are doing it a little hit bettei than
t he Americans.
()n Makeba's album, foi example, nearly hall ol
the songs would lit in perfectly on an American
RX. U radio station. " '('.ause We Live lor I ovc is
a slow Rtvb groove with a generic programmed
beat. Makeba s voice sounds like a (loss between
Dionnc Waryvick and Joan Haez, with a hint ol
Makeba's own style ol soul thrown in.

Ihe introduction to "In lime could have
appeared on a Kenny album. Soon, however,
the song progresses into a smooth, mellow piece
with a backbone ol techno and pleasant guitar
work. In her lower ranges, Makeba's voice
approximates the logginess ol I lia Fitzgerald.
While these songs do sound reinai kably similar
to Aniei i( an R&ll, an attentive listenei w ill tjiiick
l\ pic k up on the subtle ways in w hit h Makeba has
cm it lied the stagnant \ineric an ait form. Instead
of l\iits about promiscuous sex. Makeba's songs
poctically expound on nature, family, love and
Africa. In".Africa Is Where- \l\ I lean lies,"
Makeba sings: "A pic iiirescjuc sunset lights np the

I lie best 1111isic is made when musicians utilize

ol Makeba's album, and allow her lo fulls lap into

voice lias aged like a fine wine, get
ling deeper, richer, thicker and
more soullul over 11 it* years.
The song is taken at a slightly
faster tempo than the original and
finds Makeba in a highly successful
duet with Zenzi Lee. The two
women trade verses, harmonizing
beautifully on ihe second repeti
tion of each chorus. Lees higher
pitched, youthful voice creates a
startling effect in its resemblance
to Makeba's voice of long ago, as if

Makeba is embracing her past by singing with
herself.
I he metamorphosis of Makeba s voice is nevei
put to better use than on the jazzy, piano led
"Umhoine," which is also featured on South
African Legends." Singing the woes of a neglect
ed bride, Makeba mournfully bellows the South
African Ivrics in a throaty, almost breaking voice
tliiit is sureh peerless in its power. Makeba
sounds exact Iv like what she is: a glorious old
woman with more soul than all ol the R&B
singers in America put together. I ler diminishing
vocal range is more than compensated for by her
astonishing gains in emotive power.
In addition to 'T inliome,' there are two songs
on "Legends" that stand out above the rest. The
Mahotella Queens' "Mbube" is a stunningly
unique interpretation of the song Ibe Lion
Sleeps I (»niglit. I he song has become a classic in
South Africa, and the Queens demonstrate why.
I he foundation of the song is a bass, drum, and
kevboard band which <jllit kl\ settles in to a (>ar
ribean sounding vamp. Ihe characteristic
"Witnowch" chant comprises the next layer, sel
ling the stage for the lead vocalists to add the
melody <>n top. I hcv interpret and reinterpret the
recognizable ineloch until it becomes their own.
I lie other song that stands out is Johnny ("legg
.ind |iilnkri's "Gijim'beke," which juxtaposes two
layers ol vocals with a funky guitar pattern and a
II iglil\ svncopated drum beat. Ihe two layers of
vocals, bass and tenor, alternately harmonize and
counterpoint with one another. The overall effect
is simplv fantastic:.
As the walls between genres continue to fall, let's
hope that musicians like these are able to main
tain tli.it strong link to tluir own culture. It will be
the interaction of those unique c ultural influences
with other stvles and forms, rather than arbitrar
il\ defined categories, which will drive music into
the next millennium.

()n April 25, in celebration of the upcoming
South African Freedom Day, Berkeley-based
record label I'utuinayo World Music will release
two albums of African music. "South African I .em

influential South African musicians. "I loineland"
is the first new studio recording in six years liom
.i South African legend: renowned world musi
cian, ambassador, author, activist and actress
Mil i.nn Makeba.
It is difficult to think of a time when African
music was not vastly influential in America, both
on implicit and explicit levels. Reaching back .is

out need for justification.
In recent times, more artists have begun to rec
ognize the power and beaut) of African music. In
I ( .)<S7, I'aul Simon introduced South African
music to America and much of the world with his
C>i amllin winning album "(»raceland. Similarly,
199Ts "The I.ion King" soundtrack adapted
South All i( an music to a children's movie, gi\ ing
a whole new audience access to the music.
furthermore, modern groups like Arrested
Development and Rusted Root draw heavily on
tribal Afrit an beats and rhythmic chanting, using
various peicussion and nonsense syllables to
induce tlicit audiences to dame. A whole genera
tion of bands like these routinely dedicate entire
portions of their shows to rhythmic drum inter
act i<his.
Sadlv, this small sampling is the farthest most
.Americans have penetrated into the rich depths
ol South Alric an music. What's particularly iniei -
esting about this is that, in many cases, modern
clay African musicians are creating sounds that
aie remarkably similar to mainstream American
iniisii. Only, b\ adding tlicit own touch, the
South Africans are doing it a little hit bettei than
t he Americans.

women trade verses, harmonizing
beautifully on ihe second repeti
tion of each chorus. Lees higher
pitched, youthful voice creates a
startling effect in its resemblance
to Makeba's voice of long ago, as if

Makeba is embracing her past by singing with
herself.
I he metamorphosis of Makeba s voice is nevei
put to better use than on the jazzy, piano led
"Umhoine," which is also featured on South
African Legends." Singing the woes of a neglect
ed bride, Makeba mournfully bellows the South
African Ivrics in a throaty, almost breaking voice
tliiit is sureh peerless in its power. Makeba
sounds exact Iv like what she is: a glorious old
woman with more soul than all ol the R&B
singers in America put together. I ler diminishing
vocal range is more than compensated for by her
astonishing gains in emotive power.
In addition to 'T inliome,' there are two songs
on "Legends" that stand out above the rest. The
Mahotella Queens' "Mbube" is a stunningly
unique interpretation of the song Ibe Lion
Sleeps I (»niglit. I he song has become a classic in
South Africa, and the Queens demonstrate why.
I he foundation of the song is a bass, drum, and
kevboard band which <jllit kl\ settles in to a (>ar
ribean sounding vamp. Ihe characteristic
"Witnowch" chant comprises the next layer, sel
ling the stage for the lead vocalists to add the
melody <>n top. I hcv interpret and reinterpret the
recognizable ineloch until it becomes their own.
I lie other song that stands out is Johnny ("legg
.ind |iilnkri's "Gijim'beke," which juxtaposes two
layers ol vocals with a funky guitar pattern and a
II iglil\ svncopated drum beat. Ihe two layers of
vocals, bass and tenor, alternately harmonize and
counterpoint with one another. The overall effect
is simplv fantastic:.
As the walls between genres continue to fall, let's
hope that musicians like these are able to main
tain tli.it strong link to tluir own culture. It will be
the interaction of those unique c ultural influences
with other stvles and forms, rather than arbitrar

the next millennium.
