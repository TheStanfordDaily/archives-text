## Stanley Tucci's got a great Secret' 
### DANIEL MOREAU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In "Joe Gould's Secret" Joe Mitchell
(played by Stanley Tucci, who also directs)
and Joe Gould (lan Holm) are unlikely
friends. Mitchell is a writer for The New
Yorker, while Gould is a burn who haunts
the city's bars and restaurants. Their
friendship begins when Mitchell writes a
profile on Gould, who is composing an
oral history of New York: "a hodgepodge
of hearsay," as Mitchell reports.
Gould speaks of the oral history (or,
more simply, the OH) with holy reverence:
To date, it counts over one million words,
three times as long as the Bible. The oral
history consists of a scrupulously kept
record of the conversations Gould over
hears while wandering New York.
Set in the '40s, the movie itself is like a
visual history of New York, as it combines
old footage of New York street life with a
gorgeously authentic set.
In the movie's opening narration by
Mitchell, he says that Gould and he are in
some way the same. Despite the ( lass dif
ference, they both foster literary ambi
tions: Gould would like to be remembered
for his opus of conversational sketches and
essays, and Mitchell dreams of writing a
semi-autobiographical novel about a man
from the South who feels more at home in
New York than anywhere else. Above all,
they are linked by their love of the city.
Alice, a friend of Gould's played by Susan
Sarandon, savs New York "is trying to

speak through Gould."
In an Oscar-worthy performance, I.in
Holm portrays |oe (iould in .ill Ins outra
geous bawdiness with wit and poignancy.
Mitchell's fascination with (iould is under
standable.
Gould, who always carries around ran
dom chapters ol the Oil, stands up to any
one who thinks they are better than him li
berating them with clever and mordant
puns. Although homeless, (iould rises
above his condition with dignity, accepting
charity only as a donation to the "Joe
Gould Fund" which supports his literarv
endeavor.
Stanley Tucci convincingly plays .1 dap
per yet stuttering Southern gentleman

whose editor, the famed Harold Ross, is
thankful that he "writes better than [he]
talks."
After the publication of Mitchell's article,
Gould rides his new-found fame shame
lessly. He receives contributions to the
"Joe Gould Fund" by mail from admirers
throughout the country, and more impor
tantly, a benefactor — whose anonymity is

the subject of endless
frustration for Gould —
pays for his rent in a
flophouse.
\s ;i favor, Mitchell sets
Gould up with a publish
er friend (Steve Martin)
who offers to take a look

at the OH. But Gould demurs. However
much people try to help Gould, to elevate
him out of his social status as a bum, Gould
is stubbornly attached to his bohemian
lifestyle. In a scene of touching warmth,
Alice washes Gould's scabby feet in her
bathtub. "Joe," Alice says, "you got to take
care of yourself — physically, I mean.
Because no one else will."

"Joe Gould's Secret"
boasts first-class dialogue
and wonderfully recre
ates the '40s in mood and
setting. Despite a sorrow
ful turn of fate for Gould,
the movie manages to
end on a hopeful note.
