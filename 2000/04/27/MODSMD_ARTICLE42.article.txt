# Submarine thriller stays in the shallows

### RANDY MANO STAFF WRITER 
V U Miwrt Wft'Vji,
lhe more 1 thought about U-571"
after the credits had rolled, tlie greater
my disappointment. A wannabe summer
blockbuster opening several weeks early,
"U-571" tells the taut WWII tale of an
American attempt to Trojan Horse into a
(iennan U-boat to capture a valuable
Knigtna machine. Some decent special
effects, along with good, old-fashioned
ac tion, keep this underwater film afloat â€”
barely.
Interestingly enough for the historians
out there, there are several documented
efforts by Americans to storm onto
stranded U-boats and steal war materials.
Still, I think the main flaw of "U-571" is
not so much the historical accuracy or the
digital effects, but rather the overt and
stereotypical patriotism.
Matthew McConaughey, a decent actor
who displayed his talents in "F.Dtv" and
"Amistacl," does not have much to work
with as I.t. Andrew Tyler. Tyler is embit
tered that lie has not been promoted to
captain, mainly because ('.apt. Dahlgren
(bill I'axton) feels lie does not have the
.(I>ilit\ to make split-second dec isions for
his crew.
I hat's about the extent of the character
development. I here's also Jon lion |ovi,
art-house lave Harvey keitel and J.ike
Weber in the mix, but their character
names reallv ate irrelevant. What matters
in "11-57 I " is the action cjuotient.
Props should go to |onathan Mostow,
the writer-director who also lent his
efforts to the brilliant thriller "Break
down." for making sure the intensity and
mayhem never cease. I lie severe pac ing
problem in "Mission to Mars" is solved by
immediately diving into the (iennan U
-571 and then only giving a few dialogue
drive scenes for the audience to come up
for air between noisy, tense sets.
I here is a fine line between scenes that
are adrenaline-pumping and headache
inducing, and fortunately Mostow does
not move into "Armageddon" territory.
One minor issue: The use of depth
c harges for dramatic effect at three differ
ent points of the film seemed abusive and

everywhere

"11-571"
is a flim-

sy, patri
otism-soaked film
about 50 years past
its prime. The st.ui<

diflierences between the good Americans and the evil
Germans are immense, and ilie music is just plain
annoying. Hut il yon are looking for action, "U-571"
delivers lor two solid hours.
