# 'Gossip' never quite rings true
## 
### SARAH HEIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After two years jam-packed with movies filmed back in
the halls of high school, you might think watching a flick
set in college would come as a welcome change. Don't be
fooled. If you thought the teens in "Go" or "Cruel Inten
tions" seemed a little more worldly than your friends in
high school, wait until you check out the cast and campus
in director David Guggenheim's feature film debut,
"Gossip."
You'll be hard pressed to find any scene where some
modishly attired "college student" isn't sipping a martini
or throwing back a swig of expensive whiskey, be it in a
dark, swank, ultra-urban bar or a spacious, impeccably
decorated loft.
The premise of the movie is intriguing enough. For a
media ethics class project, three self-absorbed roommates
decide to start a campus rumor and track how fast the
gossip spreads. Over one of their many cosmopolitans,
they pick their target: their rich and beautiful (albeit
prudish) blonde classmate Naomi, who allegedly started
a rumor about roommate number one, Cathy Jones
(Lena Headey). What begins as your run-of-the-mill col
lege buzz — Naomi and Beau had sex at a nightclub —
rapidly begins to spiral out of control. Soon you've got
Naomi in a rubber bra and multiple mentions of a three
way. Hut the fun abruptly ends when the rumor about a
night of kinky sex takes a deadly turn into a tale of non
consensual drunken intercourse, better known as date
rape.
Don't be tricked by the deadly turn, nor by the pre
views, which may erroneously lead you to believe that
this flic k morphs into an exciting slasher thriller. It does
not. The best scenes come early on, before the dramatic
turn, while the gossip is still making its campus rounds.
Post turn, you find that roommate number two, Der
rick, the attractive, wealthy jock played by James Mars
den, actually has a dirty little secret of his own. But by this
point you will probably have stopped caring.
1 he plot makes several increasingly desperate and
occasionally clever twists and turns from here on out, but
none of them are quite able to distract anyone from the
essential awfulness of the dialogue. Nor are the handful
of visually appealing scenes in the film (including a real
ly quite beautiful opening credits sequence) any remedy
for the irritating triteness of the incessant "what has
become of truth in our media-driven virtual age" obser
vations.
The tagline of the movie's sticks-and-stones premise,
repeated with ham-handed irony in the final scene, is the
phrase "it's just words, so how bad could it be?" This is
intended to be a thought-provoking illustration of the
truth-twisting power of the Word in the information age.
Instead, it resonates with the viewer in quite a different
