## Gov't Mule cranks up the volume 
### ANDY GUSTIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Think power trio, and you begin
to get an idea of Gov't Mule.
Fronted by former Allman Broth
ers slide guitarist and singer War
ren Haynes, this group cranks out
a monstrous sound for just three
musicians. With their newest stu
dio release, "Life Before Insani
ty,' the band is clearly working to
extend the limitations of its lineup
and diversify its hard blues for
mat.
The results aren't bad, despite
the fact that your volume dial will
probably end up at about a third
its normal level when playing this
CD. From the first track, "Wan
dering Child," any latent yearn
ings for electric blues will be more
than satiated by the winding
melodies of Haynes' hard-edged
guitar and vocals over Allen
Woody's thunderous bass and the
kicking grooves of drummer Matt
Abts.
Fortunately, "Life Before Insan
ity" is more than just one fero
cious blues blowout after anoth
er. The vaguely catchy anthem
"Lay Your Burden Down" fea-

tures Hen Harper on vocals and lap steel and Johnny Neel on organ
and piano. The album's final listed track is "In My Life," an acoustic
ballad that reveals a mournful tenderness under the Mule's hide. But
sure enough, a hidden bonus track of stomping electric blues follows,
lurther affirmation of the band's true roots and message.
Indeed, despite the trio's recent history on the "jam band" circuit and

Haynes' Bay Area appearances with Phish and Phil Lesh in 1999, this
album testifies to the fact that Gov't Mule follows its own quite differ
ent musical inspiration, drawing on the legacies of Cream-era Clapton,
Hendrix, and Johnny Winter.
Gov't Mule can he an acquired taste, but this is a pretty good album
to start with — though not necessarily for the faint of heart.
