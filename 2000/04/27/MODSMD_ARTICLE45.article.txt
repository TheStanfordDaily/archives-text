# Local band's 'The Lift' a big letdown
## 
### LUKE MINER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When I first picked up the new Mephisto
Odyssey EP "The Lift," I was awash with
expectation. Affiliated with the house legend
DJ Dan, this San Francisco duo (made up of
Mikeal Johnston and Orpheos Dejournette)
was supposed to show me tlit* wonderfully
steamy club culture lurking behind my home
town's carefully polished Silicon Valley
veneer. Dot-com mers beware, I thought, this
city is for dancin', not Dave Matthews.
I thought wrong.
With its obtuse beats, Clod-awful sampling
and tone-deaf keyboard work, " 1 he Lift" is a
lazy journey into mediocrity. Most disap
pointing is the first single on the album enti
tled "The Flow." Very little about this song
flows. In fact its lazy breakbeats layered with
off-key vocals and pointless synthesizer lines
come across as a really bad copy of Crystal
Method's "Busy Child" (you know, from the
Gap ads). Perhaps a better name for this
song would be "No Flow."
The next track on the EP is DJ Dan's
remix of "The Flow." I must admit I was a lit
tle apprehensive at first. How can a produc
er who is as talented as DJ Dan save .1 terri
ble song? The answer is simple: by making a
remix that sounds absolutely nothing like
the original. DJ Dan's song is by tar the best
track on the album, which realh isn't saying
much. The EP's title track, "The Lift," is only
slightly better than "The Flow." Mephisto
Odyssey goes back to the basics laying down
a generic house beat with the requisite
female R&B singer in the background.
Although this song is certainly listenable, it
isn't especially gripping. In fact, I'd probably

get more enjoyment out of listening lo (> min
utes and IT) seconds of whale noises.
I lie rest of the album is equalh dull,
encouraging only the most sporadic head
boh. If the boys over at Warner Brothers are
expecting Mephisto Odyssey to release a
breakout hit a hi Crystal Method, thev are in
for a terrible surprise.
