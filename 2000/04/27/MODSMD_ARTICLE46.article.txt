# No Doubt brings back So. Cal ska
## 
### JUNG LAH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When discussing the Orange County suc
cess story that is No Doubt, Gwen Stefani's
name usually comes up pretty quick. Her
midriff-baring tank tops and girlish voice
have often taken precedence over the band s
music, a topic that was explored in the video
for the mega-hit "Don't Speak." I hat track,
off of 1995's "Tragic Kingdom," was played
to death on alternative and easy listening
radio stations alike, garnering the hand
instant recogni/ability despite the fact that the
song sounded almost nothing like the rest of
their repertoire.
"Return of Saturn," then, is a huge step for
No Doubt not only because ii is their first new
material in five years, but also because it is
their first record following their hugely suc
cessful breakthrough and subsequent period
of relative anonymity. No Doubt formed in
Anaheim, California as a two-tone ska quartet
back in 1987. Shortly afterwards, band mem
ber John Spence committed suicide, but the
band persevered by touring furiously and
finally landing a record deal with Interscope
in 1992. Gwen's brother Eric, one of the key
songwriters of the group, left the band in
1995 to become a "Simpsons" animator right
before No Doubt hit the mainstream, selling
over 15 million copies of "Tragic Kingdom
worldwide.

I he five-year hiatus between albums has
been filled with touring and some failed stu
dio sessions, but their recent small-dub tour
last fall set things in motion for the new
record and really demonstrated an apprecia
tion for the fans who had onl\ been able to
catch the band at sold-out arenas during the
past few years. That tour, which included a
stop at the soon-to-be-defunct Hclge in Palo
Alto, as well as their current tour which
included a stop in San Francisco last week
end, included all of the traditional No Doubt
live treats — the "Main Street Klectrical
Parade Theme Song," the "Star Wars Impe
rial March," and a Sublime cover recalling the
band's friendship with that band's lead
singer, Bradley Nowell.
So what does "Return of Saturn" offer in
terms of musical range? Surprisingly, a much
more solid collection of times than could be
found on " I ragic Kingdom." I lie overall feel
of the record is more mellow, with a kind of
synthesized sound that evokes produced
musical exploration, but at the same time
impressive instrumental performances. The
overall result rocks harder than one might
expect.
The first single, "Ex-Girlfriend." contains
spoken-word verses and energetic chorus
lines that set a mood which is at once both
manic in its rhythm shifting and unlikely in its
collection of sounds. Other songs, like "Big
Distraction" and "Bathwater," have a decid

edly Broadway musical feel to them, mixing
in two-tone horns and upbeat piano to create
surprisingly listenable melodies.
"Six Feet Under" combines punk and new
wave on one of the album's strongest tracks;
the song "New," off of the "Go" soundtrack.
It,is a similar feel with its driving guitar riffs
distorted just enough to have that feeling of
urgent intensity underscoring the entire
album. Other songs, like "Too Late" and
"Suspension Without Suspense," feel too
tunc li like "Don't Speak" in that mushy ballad
kind of way, ultimate!) coining ofl as musical
ly unexciting.
At one point, Gwen tells the listener, "/Ml I
wanted was a simple kind of life," but judging
from the complexity of "Return of Saturn's"
lyrics, she's leading anything but a simple life
of late. At age thirty, her musings on mar
riage and uncertainty demonstrate a longing
that reaches beyond her pink hair and uppi
ty girlish demeanor. This is by far the group's
most layered work, both sonicallv and lyrical
ly, and it's nice to see progression from a for
mer garage band 13 years in the making.
