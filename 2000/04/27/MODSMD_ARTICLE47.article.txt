# Lyrical disaster is saved by melodies

"Incoherent" best describes Michael Penn's latest stab, "MP4
(days since a lost time accident)." The title is meaningless as far
as 1 know, but so are the lyrics; at least Penn is consistent in this
respect.
Penn's sound brings to mind Oasis, the Wallflowers, and, at
moments, the Beatles. Fortunately, Penn's daring melodies sur
passes anything Oasis or the Wallflowers have ever done.
The melodies are the best part of the album. In each song,
Penn puts many different melodies together one after another.
Most are so tenuously related, you don't know what the next
phrase will sound like. So the beautiful lines catch you off guard,
and that's where Penn's method works best. On the flip side, the
track "Beautiful" lives up to its name for two minutes before the
incongruous B-section breaks the song and renders it irrepara
ble.
Unfortunately, this album features some awful lyrics — the
kind of stuff you wrote in sixth grade to piss off your English
teacher. I swear he's not being facetious when he sings: "while
you wait / a demonstrator demonstrates / that you've run out of
/ holy water, dude." Add to this an unrelenting compulsion to
rhyme every stanza and you'll quickly tune out the words
because it hurts too much to listen.
Some people will like this album for the variety and creativity
Penn tries just a little too hard to infuse his songs with. You
know it's not working when you can't bear to listen to the last 30
seconds of any song, and you're thinking to yourself: "nice try
Penn, I hope the next track is better."
You might find it interesting that Michael Penn is the brother

of actors Sean and Christo
pher Penn. Also of interest,
Aimee Mann, recently of
"Magnolia" fame, provides
backup vocals on "Whole
Truth"and "High Time."
That's what it says in the
liner notes, anyway. Person
ally, I didn't hear her.
