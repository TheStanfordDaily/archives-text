at the end ol a
three month

admirable per
formers are
mostly from the

of Kampala.
The tour's
goal is to pro
mote awareness
lor the AIDS cri
sis in Uganda,
an epidemic
which has
orphaned 1.4 mil
lion Ugandan
children. Alexis
Hefley, the presi-

dent and executive director ol
I ( ( I , (alls the tour "education
through performance."

The coinpam also creak's sup
port for Ugandan orphans who
are in serious need of help. "1 he
cost to send a child lo school in
Uganda," Hcfle\ says, "is a stag
gering SHOO. Although ii ma\
not seem like much in America,
S.'iOO is the average annual
income in I ganda."
In addition, this widespread
financial poverty makes medical
care for AIDS virtual!) impossi
ble. "Cliven the high cost of new
AIDS clings, treatment is simph
and sadly not a realit) for every
day Ugandans," says Hefley.
Nevertheless, llefle) asserts
that the company finds hope
through performance: "It gives
them the- chance for self-expres
sion and release; it also energizes
them." At the same time, they
inspire other children hack
home. " I hey are envied In their
peers for their gilts and talent as
well as for the opportunit) to
visit America."
Cultural exchange is also
another important part <>l the
tour, as the group performed for
and were treated to a perfor
mance In Native Americans on a
reservation in Arizona.

coinpam experienc ed some mild
