# GSC: Demerits not on ballot
## 
### KATIE HILL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council
decided by consensus last night to
table discussion of the Hearings
Committee recommendations re
garding convictions and demerits
against presidential slate Seth
Newton and Malia Villegas, ensur
ing that no demerits will appear on
the ballots for Thursday and Fri
day's runoff election.
The GSC also voted down a
measure passed by the Undergrad
uate Senate on Tuesday that would
limit runoff campaign spending to
$60.
"We are not prepared to make a
decision based on the information
available to us at t his time, and thus
we are tabling the issue pending
further details from the Elections
Committee," said a statement read
from the meeting minutes.
The meeting was attended by
current and newly-elected GSC
members, vice presidential candi
date Mike Dudas, as well as Under
graduate Senate Chair Steven
Aronowitz, Undergraduate Sena
tor Nikki Love and Elections Tech
nical Advisor Eric Albert. GSC
member Paul Hartke, who, unlike
many other ASSU members, has
not endorsed any slate, facilitated
the debate.
Discussion grew heated as both
sitting and incoming GSC mem
bers debated whether the GSC
should base its decision on prag
matism or procedure.

"The Law School is in exams
next week, and if we delay the
runoff election, it virtually guaran
tees that no law students will par
ticipate," stated one sitting council
member.
"Is it our job to ensure high
voter turnout or is it our job to en
sure a fair election?" countered
Alan Marcus, a representative
from the School of Education.
Towards the end of the debate
Dudas addressed the Council.
Dudasand his co-candidate Ben
Liu, were awarded no demerits in
Tuesday's Hearings Committee
ruling. In a closed hearing last
night, Liu and Dudas were cleared
by the Hearings Committee of fur
ther charges.
"Voters should have some sense
of the difference between the two
slates here. One slate has been
given no demerits by the elections
committee; the other 14," Dudas
said. "Both slates have been run
ning a campaign based on the as
sumption that there would be pun
ishment for violations, and that
should be kept in mind."
The GSC can still make a deci
sion to punish either slate at a later
date and can decide what they
want that punishment to be at a
later date. That punishment could
take any form: demerits, as the un
dergraduate senate approved, or
something different, such as fines.
"The ASSU Elections campaign
should be about the issues, and not
about the campaign itself . Hie CSC
has approached this entire cam
paign drama from the perspective
of personal disinterest — a per
spective that was so badly needed
light now," said ASSU Vice Presi
dent John Mills. "I'm hopeful that
the decisions of the GSC will help us
to put personal politics aside and
allow the campus to really focus on
the candidates and their ideas."
Today's decision came after the

council voted five to three earlier
in the meeting to validate last
week's original election. In validat
ing the original election, the GSC
agreed to allow the runoff election,
scheduled for Thursday and Fri
day, to proceed as scheduled, with
both slates listed and no spaces for
write-in votes.
Had they decided not to vali
date the election, the runoff could
have been delayed or restruc
tured.
Elections Committee member
Nikki Love explained, "Basically,
in tabling the issue the convictions
handed down by the hearings

committee stand. If the GSC de
cides on a punishment that is dif
ferent from the one approved by
the Undergraduate Senate, a con
ference committee will be called to
make a final decision."
She added that "This whole sit
uation is not the Election Commis
sion's fault. All of these problems
with rules and bylaws and consti
tutionality have little to do with the
Elections Commission. The Exec
tive Committee, Senate and CiSC.
should have dealt with these issues
a long time ago, and we — myself,
other senators, the Ex Com — are
really to blame.
