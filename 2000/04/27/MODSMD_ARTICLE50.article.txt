### JUNG LAH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Just because the pla) "Half-Lives" is put on In the Asian
American I heat re Project doesn't mean it's just for Asian
Americans.
|olni Lim directs this entirely student-run student-pro
duced performance detailing the lives of four high school
teenagers' lives in the l ( .)<SO's. Winnie \ uan stars as Justine
Fukuvama, a voting actress whose aspirations conflict will)
her lather Frank's views. Frank, port raved l>\ Sam I In. is ;i
r>()-vcar-old, second-general ion lapanese-American w h< >se
experience as a child in the World War 11 internment camps
gives him ;t decidedlv different take on racial integiation
than that <>l his daughter.
When |ustine's classmate Mikl J i Hi\Win^f<'>n' , '|jlavecl J>\
Mike (aitalo, decides to produce "Hamlet" at thc-ii high
school, the two become romantically involved, which spurs
Mike to present a new take on the pla\ having Polonius'
family be Asian. I his way he can cast Justine as an Asian
()phelia, .1 pan she gladh accepts despite her lather's disap
proval.
"Justine tries to hide being cast from her lather." I In
explains. " I lie rest of the pla\ is about how this pans out.
Jen lung plays Justine's friend Mericlle, and Will Kwong
rounds out the cast as llamlet assistant directoi Dave Kim.
What sets this pla) apart from the AA I I's usual produc -
tions is its modern south perspective. Asian-American the
ater tends to locus on the older generation, dealing with the
rebellion of the vounger generation's c onstruc tiou of identi
t\. a theme explored in the AA I I' s hist three productions
(including former Stanford student David llenr\ Hwang's
"F.0.1L")
I Iwang. in fact, started the A A I P back in l ( .)7<>. I he pro

jet t went through a dormant period in the earlx ( .)os, hut is
now thriving and looking u> expand. Directoi Lim hopes
that the A A I I' will grow to put out multiple p lavs even \ ear,
.is well as holtling a plax writing workshop open to anyone
willing to enroll.
(Concerning "I lall'-l.ix'es." Inn notes how plaxs rexohing
around Asian -America 11 themes don't net essai il\ hax'e to at t
as political statements. "We're jnsi port raxing the lixes ol
normal people like aux other play," he s,i\s.
Indeed. "MaH-Livcs" makes iis political motifs implicit,
focusing rather on ideas o I child-pa rent con flit I and Ameri
ca's inherent racism, themes accessible to a more general
audience. "I he plax is more ol demonstration of \siau tal
ents as opposed to \sian themes,' saxs Will kwong. I.im
agrees, adding that the cast and 11 ew want to present the
plax as a work ol art, not something spe c ilic to anx { > r \i tic i|-

At I vert ised as a Workshop I'rod net ion, this is Ihe Ii 1 si time

Both x iew points, represented In Hank and justinc. rcspec
