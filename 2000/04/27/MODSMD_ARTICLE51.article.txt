understand the words ol some
songs. especialk when the over
whelming gaggle ol laities sings
together. (Considering the rela
n\el\ slow pace ol the spoken
dialogue, more energ\ during
the songs would help to move
the show along. Nevertheless,
"lolanthe is <|iiite engaging

overall.
I lie set designers have trans
formed unassuming Dinkelspiel
Auditorium into a magical for
est. (iiant mushrooms and eight
lool flowers create the perfect
si tting for the tiny fairies. I he
costuming is excellent as well;
the fairies create a spectacle of
color when they dance, and the
Peers are resplendent in lavish

robes.
I'he Savoyards are in their
l J7tli year of performing, and
present two shows per season,
fully-staged. I here are fourteen
operas, including "If.M.S.
Pinafore, "Mikado," "The
Pirates of Penzance," "Patience,"
and "Princess Ida." A recent suc
cess at the Academy Awards,
" lopsy-Turvy" chronicled

their "hit" decade, theii com
menial slump with "Princess
