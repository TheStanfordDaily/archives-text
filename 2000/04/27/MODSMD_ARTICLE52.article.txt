# Not in the mood? Massages will get you there

"No matter what your sexual beliefs, fantasies, kink or
persuasion nothing beats a good backrub."
â€” Paul Joannides
Midterms are coming up, and your body feels tense.
You can't concentrate. Miss Sass's prescription, as
always: get laid.
"But I'm not in the mood!" you wail. " That's the
whole problem!"
As a matter of fact, Miss Sass considers this the classic
Catch-22 of sex. Sex is a de-stresser, hut a high level of
stress tends to make sex sound less penis-licking good.
The best solution Miss Sass can offer is that of a long
massage, starting with a full-body muscular and erotic
massage, bridging with a genital massage and eventual
ly ending with the sex fix you didn't even know you
desperately needed. Thus, massage can be thought of
as a kind of foreplay to the fbreplay!
Act One: Setting the Scene
Recognize that a good massage takes a lot of time, as
you should be lingering over every single curve and
detail of your lover's naked body. Unplug the phone,

light some candles, put on some quiet music and turn out t lie
lights. Make sure the room is warm enough that your lover
can lie naked comfortably. Provide pillows for comfort. Zap
some massage oil in the microwave and have it nearby. Try
to avoid conversation during the massage so your lover can
concentrate on the physical sensations.
Act Two: Full Body Massage
Start with a massage of her tired muscles. Use your
thumbs, the balls of your hands, your knuckles and your
elbows to drive away tension, making sure that you're not
hurting her by pressing too hard. Knead the muscles with
authority or just apply firm pressure against them for at least
half art hour.
Act Three: Erotic Massage
The primary purpose of an erotic massage is to tease and
tempt, not to relieve muscle soreness. Thus, your touch
should be gentle or even feather light at times as you caress.
To make the massage experience even more intimate,
never remove your hands from her body.
You should be creative with your fingers and try to make
contact with every millimeter of your partner's body. Think
of the skin as one huge erotic organ just waiting for your
light touch to awaken it. As you run your fingers all over her
body, she is likely to find the sensation more and more elec
trifying, and her body may start to tingle.
Spend up to fifty minutes.
Act Four: Genital Massage On Women
Genital massages can be particularly exciting for women,
since men tend to pleasure women by going straight for the
central pleasure points: the clitoris and the vajtinal opening.
In reality, the entire vulva is very sensitive to the touch. Cien
tletnen, imagine how you would feel if all she ever did was

touch the head of your penis? How sad. Points that bring
subtle pleasure can be just as important as those that set off
fireworks.
Gentleness is even more important when massaging a
woman. Men tend to be too rough with a woman's genitals
because they assume that they can be treated just like a penis,
which responds well to just about any kind of treatment.
News flash: softer is almost always better.
Start with a long stroke. Place your hands over her vulva,
fingers pointing toward the ground, then slowly slide one
hand over her, using your fingertips to gently separate her
lips. As soon as that hand reaches her stomach, start the
motion with the other hand. You should feel almost as
though you're digging in slow motion.
Now imagine her vagina is a clock. You're going to use
your well-oiled fingers to explore every dimension of this
clock. Start with the outer lips and move around them in a
clockwise motion, squeezing them gently between your fin
gers. Again, you're trying to touch and thus awaken every
millimeter of her shady valley. Tug the outer lips away from
the body, caress the insides and outsides of the lips, and gen
tly rub the lips between your fingers as il you're trying to
separate paper that's stuck together.
After five to ten minutes, you can move on to the inner
lips. You should follow the same clockwise pattern and gen
tle motions on these lips. Keep moving inwards with your
clocking until you are circling the clitoris.
Now clock around the clitoris, making a jiggling motion
against it at each one-hour clock interval. Run your fingers
over the clitoral hood, then roll the clitoris between your
thumb and forefinger.
Move your fingers down to the vaginal entrance, and con
tinue clocking the area, rimming the hole with your finger
tips. Slowly place a finger inside, and {"nil jjressiire on each
part <>! the tissue as you eventually make a complete circle.
Keep moving your finger farther inside and circling the tis

sue with the pad of one finger. Pay particular attention to
the roof of her vagina between 9:00 and 3:00, as this is
often most sensitive to touch.
On Men
The goal of erotic massage on a man is to keep him
aroused for as long as possible without having an orgasm.
Again, your hand should be well lubricated so you don't
tug on his skin.
Use a variety of different motions when stroking his
penis and balls. First, use your fingertips to slowly
explore the entire area, one fingertip at a time. The
anticipation will make your next caress feel even better.
You can try an open-hand massage, leading into a
closed-hand approach. Circle your hand around his
penis and pull it slowly up toward the head, then press it
back down toward the base slowly. Try using your
thumbs to trace a line from the base of the penis to the
head and back down again. Move your thumb over half
an inch, and draw a new line.
As you get farther into the massage, you may want to
try twisting motions. Hold the shaft of the penis between
your two hands and wring it (gently!) the way you would

a wet towel. Then try holding the shaft of the penis still with
one hand and using the other hand to twist the head of the
penis, almost like twisting the top off a bottle. Each of these
strokes should be repeated several times, but not so many
times that they get boring or uncomfortable.
After you're sure you've hugged every part of his woody
tree, start to apply pressure to the rim of the head of the
penis. Trace the rim around the penis, then rub it between
your fingers. Place your hand over the head of the penis like
a giant spider, close the spider's legs around the penis, and
pull upwards as though you are picking something up, thus
stimulating the rim even more.
Pay particular attention to the rim on the underside of his
penis. It's the most sensitive part of shaft, and he may want
you to rub the area more firmly in a circular motion.
While performing this massage on his penis, you should
cup his balls whenever possible. You should also take time
out to massage them. You can do one at a time, using your
fingertips to cover all of the surface area, then pretend they
are Chinese stress release balls, and roll them around in your
palm. Tug on the skin holding the balls, and pull the balls
away from the body while you do some upward strokes of
the penis.
Fortunately, the penis isn't nearly as particular about the
treatment it receives as the vagina is. However, this doesn't
mean you should spend any less time paying attention to it,
and you should certainly make note of any spots that seem to
be particularly sensitive for your lover.
Act Five: Foreplay
It's finally time to start thinking about sex! If you've been
in this frame of mind for a while, don't let Miss Sass stop you.
