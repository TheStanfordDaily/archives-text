# The
						wild world of web porn

### 
You like looking at naked people
Just admit it, and don't play all high
and mighty with me when 1 take
Nothing but 'Net into the red
light district of Cyberworld.

The thing is, there isn't a
more annoying genre of sites on
the Internet. For some reason,
people that run sites about sex
think that they can manipulate
their users to no end. When
was the last time you typed in a
web address, arrived at the site,
and then were immediately
bounced to site after site
uncontrollably?
It will happen to you if you
try to find a good porn site
— you will find yourself
frantically closing browser
windows, worrying if your
roommate can hear your
computer whirring, all the
while cursing the decision to
look at such a naughty site.
Don't give any credit card
information. Even if it says the
membership is free, they will
find a way to make you pay.
" The free period starts after a
three day membership, which
costs exactly $5.99," the operator

said. Unless, of course, you don't mind

paying.
If you do mind paying, check out www.passwordhq.com.
I'asswordhq has passwords to many good pay sites, so that you
can get the highest quality nakedness without paying for it.
The headquarters has sites from Animal to Fetish — make
sure you check the description of the site before you click on
it. The ease and speed of using each site is also listed with their
web address — for convenience, of course.
-Another good links site is www.persiankitty.com. Persian
Kitty has a background of the week, a site of the day, and mil
lions of free porn sites to peruse. The individual sites are
alphabetically listed, and the number of pictures and movies is
listed to give an idea of the quality of the site. You won't find
as many movies on free sites, though. You have to pay to see
the bodies move.
Freshman year, I had this "game" I played with my dorm

mates tli.it basically involved trying to find the most disgusting
sex act. I submit that I have found that thing, ladies and gen
tleman, on a little site called www.consumptionjunction.com.
('heck the "crazy crap" section, then "videos," if you have a
solid heart. It may throw you off. It may scar you.
A site that gets good reviews is www.babylon-x.com. Babylon
X boasts a rich selection of videos, good-looking models, and
no ad banners. About as classy as a porn site can be, and not
too expensive. At least that's what people tell me.
It's really hit or miss in the porn world. You may be on what
looks like a ratty little site and find the best video you've ever
seen. It's really just as easy to be 011 a pay site and find only
gross pictures of somebody's ex-wife. So be patient when you
start the one-handed net surfing, and leave your credit card in
your pants.
