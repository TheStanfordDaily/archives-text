# Feel-good flick lacks substance
## 
### RANDY MANO STAFF WRITER 
At the close of the screening for "Frequency," the audience reac
tion was unusually favorable and boisterous. 1 have to admit I felt
pretty good about myself after the movie, but my job is to present a
more analytic (rather than emotional) perspective. That's why 1 rel
egate "Frequency" to mediocrity, despite my heart telling me other
wise.
In the mold of "October Sky," this crowd pleaser centers on a
traditional family — father, mother and son. The crux of "Frequen
cy" is with a 36-year-old police officer named John (played by Jim
Caviezel) talking to his father, Frank (Dennis Quaid), 30 years in the
past.
This may sound like a bizarre premise, but on the whole, it works
as a device. Frank and his wife, Julia (Elizabeth Mitchell), are happi
ly living in 1969 with Johnny when a strange man named John
enters their lives via a sound transmitter. Time apparently gets bent
in the aurora borealis, or northern lights, at 30-year intervals (or so),
and soon enough, father and son are communicating with each
other.
Things start to get hairy once John tries to warn his father about
his approaching death. Philosophical questions then pop up as the
future is forever changed several times with the exchange of advice.
What happens when a person's own life has been altered in the past?
("Frequency" states only the person realizes that a change has taken
place.) How many sets of memories should this person have? (The
movie says two — one of the original reality, one of the new.)
Amusing side characters arrive in the form of best friend Gordo
(Noah Emmerich) and long-time cop Satch (Andre Braugher). More
importantly, timely conversations involving Yahoo! and the World
Series set up later scenes.

Director Gregory Hoblit,
who dazzled everyone but me with
"Primal Fear," has tried to use the
ribbon approach again here. By
ribbon approach, 1 mean that plot
elements only exist so that the end
ing feels complete, as if a ribbon has
been neatly tied around the

package. Theoretically, "Frequency" could have gone on an endless
cycle of what-ifs, but because certain events are singled out for their
importance, the triviality and contrivance of the proceedings only
increase as the movie moves to its conclusion.
"Frequency" is an adult fairy tale replete with suspenseful twists
and aw-shucks moments. It's something you would read to yourself
before going to bed as a sort of reassurance that the world is not such
a bad place. Here, that warm fuzzy feeling only substitutes reality for
fantasy — and a ludicrous fantasy at that.
