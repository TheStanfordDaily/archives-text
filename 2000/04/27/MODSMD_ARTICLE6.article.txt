### CHRISTINA LARSON 
Shubha Chakravarty, a co-terminal stu
dent in Management Science and Kngineer
ing, was one of 1 (> American college students
participating during Spring Break in audits
of factories contracted to manufacture Nike
apparel.
Chakravarty visited garment factories in
Indonesia and Bangladesh where she spoke
with workers, factory monitors and Nike offi
cials about workplace conditions, wages,
worker safety and other concerns.
After returning to the I'nited States, she
and the other students involved have com
piled recommendations for improvement in a
report which Nike released publicly on I'ues
day.
Chakravarty will be speaking on labor con
ditions in Bangladesh in conjunction with a
class sponsored b\ Project DOS If tonight at 8
p.m. in Building 50, room 5211.
Application and preparation
As an undergraduate at Stanford.
Chakravarty served as a co-coordinator lot
Students lor Knvirontnental Action at Stan
ford and as a student representative to the
Advisory Panel on Investment Responsibility.
In December, she completed an applica
tion for the Nike program which included a
phone interview , three letters of recommen
dation and an essay stating her reasons for
being interested in the experience.
To Chakravarty, the program would be ";i
rare chance to gain access to both the factories

thai make Nike products and I lie people at
Nike who deal with labor practices."
Afterbeing notified of her acceptance into
the program, she and 1 5 other students were
flown to New York f<>r a weekend of intensive
teaching and training sessions administered
In representatives from Nike and PriceWa
terhouseC.oopers, the external firm hired by
Nike to perform factor) audits.

During their spring breaks, the students
traveled to Nike contract factories in Asia,
Latin America and North America. Students
were generally required to be fluent in the
language of the countries they visited.

Sixteen American college students were selected to visit garment factories such as these in Indone
sia and Bangladesh over Spring Break.
she was required to work through
a translator in Indonesia.
In addition to participating in
the formal factory audits,
Chakravarty arranged to spend
time in both countries meeting
with local unions, non-govern
mental organizations and workers
outside the factory premises.
Chakravarty's role in the moni
toring procedures
Nike hires PWC, an American ac
counting and consulting firm with
a division in independent labor
monitoring, to perform audits of
the factories with which it main
tains contracts. PWC also audits
factories for Wal-mart, Disney,
Gap and other large companies
which contract labor abroad.
On the days of the three audits,
Chakravarty arrived with the
PWC officials at the factories by 9
a.m. After an opening meeting
with the factory management, she
toured the factory floor, examin
ing such health and safety fat ilities
as fire extinguishers, drinking
water and protective garments
worn by workers.
PWC accountants then began a
documentation check of the facto
ry's financial records, while
Chakravarty assisted with worker
interviews.
According to Chakravarty,
these interviews consisted of a
standard set of 60 questions, used
worldwide, about the workplace
experience. "We asked workers
how many hours they work,
whether or not they are subjected
to verbal or physical abuse and
whether or not their wages are
enough to meet their basic needs,"
she said.
She noted with dismay that "the
PWC monitoring process does not
keep the identities of interviewed
workers confidential."
She explained that "the moni
tors collect the II) badge numbers
of the 25 workers that they choose
to interview, hand the list ofbadge
numbers to a member of manage
ment and the management is in
charge of finding the worker on
the floor and escorting her to the
private interview room."
Chakravarty expressed con
cern about the workers' willing
ness to speak to auditors under
these conditions.

"Especially after being escorted
to the interview by a member of
management, workers often feel
reluctant to voice any complaints,"
she said.
She noted that she had "heard
reports, both inside and outside of
the factory, that workers were told
not to complain to us[bv factory su
pervisors]." She said that workers
may have felt that their jobs would
be put in jeopard) if they spoke out
against their line supen isors.
Chakravarty was also con
cerned the fact that all audit dates
were pre-announced to the factory
management.
"Not even the most keen moni
tor," she explained, "can be certain
of just how different the factory
conditions are on thcda\ of a mon
itoring visit versus an average da\
of operation."
"In New York [at the training
session], Nike officials kept repeat
ing their challenge to the students
to judge objectively," Chakravart\
said.
But she expressed disma\ that
the interview procedures seemed
to be "inherently biased by the lack
of Worker confidentiality.
Purpose and publicity of the trip
According to Dusty Kidcl, Nike's
Global Director of Labor Practices,
the purpose of this trip, co-spon
sored by Nike and PYVC, was to
"invite university students to take a

cliflerent kind of Spring Break . . .
lo monitor I lit* factories that pro
duce the Nike licensed products
sold in I heir university book
stores."
" These 16 students have taken
a long hard look at our monitor
ing process, and the majority of
our collegiate licensed product
manufacturing sites," Kidd ex
plained.
According to Chakravarty, an
other purpose of the trip was to
"allow Nike to generate some pos
itive public ity and "earn bragging
rights" about its commitment to
improving labor conditions.
"Basically, Nike spawned this
trip in response to intense criticism
[of their labor policies] from ac
tivists on college campuses," she
said.
(lhakravarty cites the fact that
the advertisements designed to
publicize the Nike program
seemed to directly respond to —
and also lampoon — the criticism
of labor rights groups, such as
I nited Students Against Sweat
shops, ac tive on many college c am
puses.
Last year, Nike took out full
page ads in college newspapeis .11
universities where criticism <>l the
company was most vigorous. One
ad proclaimed "Where can von get
the most accurate facts on our
labor practices? Mint: Frobabh not
from the guy wearing a sign and
yelling 'Nike sucks! "

Holding Nike accountable
Following her involvement in
the program, (lhakravarty ac
knowledges ambivalent feelings
about the trip. On the one hand,
she acknowledges the positive
changes that Nike has instituted in
the last five years. On the other
hand, she recognizes several seri
ous problems which still must be
addressed.
She explains that "the Nike rep
resentatives that I met in Asia do
seem genuinely committed to im
proving labor conditions."
112 fowever, she is not yet ready to
exonerate Nike of the criticisms
levied against it.
She emphasized the need for
continued efforts to improve what
she deemed "the two major areas of
concern with factory conditions: the
inadequacy of wages and the lac k of
an effective grievance prcxedure."
(lhakravarty is now willing to
hold Nike officials accountable to
the promise which they have made
to her and to all of the other stu
dent participants.
In a press statement which ac
companied the release of the stu
dents' final report, Kidd pledged
to continue Nike's effort to bettei
factory conditions: "We commit to
report back [to the students] in
three months what we and the fac
tories have accomplished."
