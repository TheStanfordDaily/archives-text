Adult prisons no place for
juveniles, defender argues
CI ARSON (TIT (AP) — A judge and a public defend
er have told Nevada lawmakers thai juveniles plated in
adult prisons are targets for beatings and rapes and have
a high suic ide rate.
Family Court Judge Robert Caston and Special
Deputy Public Defender Christina Wildeveld, both from
Clark County, add that juvenile judges need more dis
cretion when plac ing youngsters awaiting trial or in sen
tencing them.
Juveniles who commit certain violent crimes are now
automatically placed in the adult judicial system, without
seeing a juvenile judge.
Wildeveld, who represents juveniles acc used of mur
der, said told a legislative subcommittee Wednesday that
children awaiting trial in an adult detention center are
five times more likely to he sexually assaulted, twice as
likely to he beaten up and eight times as likely to commit
suicide than adult inmates.
Wildeveld and (iaston suggested Nevada's law be
changed to allow what is called a "blended sentence." It
would mean the convicted juvenile would spend time in
a youth facility lief ore going to prison.
Bill will ban racial profiling
SACRAMKNTO (AP) — Cov. Cra\ Davis has agreed
to sign a bill bail ing police fiom stopping motorists be
cause of their race, seven months alter he vetoed a mea
sure designed to reveal the extent of the practice.
The Democratic governor and the author of the earli
er bill, Sen. Kevin Murray, D-Culver City, said Thursday
that they reached agreement on legislation that would
ban so-called racial profiling of motorists.
I he new bill would expand diversity training for po
lice and require officers who are not working undercov
er to give their business cards to motorists they stop but
don't c ite or arrest.
I'he bill is aimed at what c ivil rights advocates sav is a
widely used police practice of stopping and questioning
black and I fispanic motorists even though there's no in
dication the drivers have committed a crime.
Several hundred people rallied I hursday in front of
the (lapitol to protest the prac tic e, also known as "driving
while black or brown," and to boo I );t\ is' veto of the ear
lier bill.
ACADEMIA
Salary gap grows over time
I he disparity in starting salaries between male and fe
male professors can be attributed eniirch to legitimate
differences in educational credentials, productivity and
career choices, according to the results of a study pre
sented Wedties'c'l'ay at the a'umVal fheding of tlve Aineri-"
can Kducarion Research Association here, but at each fac
ulty lifrik; experienced feiniile pi'dlcssors suffer from a
pay gap that those lac tors cannot full) explain, the study
found.
Researchers in the past have tried to explain why le
in.lie faculty iiiembei sin the I nitcd States earn about 75
percent as much as then male counterparts with similar
rank and experience. Most ol the gap can be explained In
the fact that female professors are less likely to have doc -
toral degrees or graduate fellowships on tlieii resumes,
less likely to conduct research, and less likely to c hoose
academic fields that pay well, female professors are also
disproportionately employed at institutions with lower
pay and less emphasis on research.
Yet those lac tors failed to explain a sex-based p;i\ gap
of 7 percent among assistant pre>fess<us with three 1 to six
years of experience, of <S percent among associate pro
lessors with seven to 13 years of experience, and I per
cent among full professors with more than 20 years on
the job.
