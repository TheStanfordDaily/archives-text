## 55 more victims are exhumed in Uganda

KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) —
A month after officials dug up
hundreds of victims of a Ugan
dan doomsday cult, workers on
yesterday exhumed the bodies of
55 more people — mostly
women and children — from a
garage rented by a cult leader.
Gravediggers clad in yellow
plastic protective gear removed
the bodies of 22 women, 15 men,
10 girls and eight boys from
three graves in a garage attached
to a small brick house in Ggaba, a
residential area just south of
Kampala, police spokesman
Assuman Mugenyi said.
He said the bodies bore no
external signs of violence and the
cause of death would be deter
mined by pathologists. The
remains were wrapped in black
polyethylene bags and loaded
onto a trailer to l>e taken to the
municipal cemetery for burial.
The exhumations came a
month after baref(*)t prisoners in
shorts dug up 80 bodies and a
skull from a cult compound in
the village of Rushojwa in south
western Uganda, the last of four
properties tied to the cult where
bodies were found.
Mugenyi said police had sus
pected for some time that there
might be bodies at the Ggaba
house rented by excommunicat
ed Roman Catholic priest
Dominic Kataribabo, a leader of
the Movement for the Restora
tion of the Ten Commandments
— the cult now blamed for 979
deaths.
But criticism over the use in
the villages of unprotected pris
oners to unearth the bodies, cou
pled with international media
coverage, prompted authorities
to suspend the search until they
had assembled the necessary
equipment.
It's feared that the grisly dis
covery in Ggaba would not be
the last.
"We have not got the logistics

for the whole investigation,"
Mugenyi told The Associated
Press. "This was in the city, and
people were concerned, and we
were equally concerned, so we
had to give it priority. We will
wait until everything is ready,
and then we will resume the
work."
Dozens of police and soldiers
kept reporters and photogra
phers well away from the prop
erty as the bodies were being
dug up.
Mugenyi said the digging at
the Ggaba compound was fin
ished, and authorities did not
expect to find more bodies there.
When several hundred peo
ple were reported to have per
ished in a fire at a cult compound
in Kanungu on March 17, the
deaths were first believed to have
been a mass suicide. Authorities
later said 530 people were
burned alive.
When six bodies were found
in a pit latrine in the same com
pound, and then 388 more in
houses owned or rented by c ult
leaders in three other villages,
officials began to speak of mass
murder.
()n April 6, police issued arrest
warrants for Kataribalx), Joseph
Kibwetere, Credonia Mwerinde
and three other c ult leaders.
Friends and relatives of the vic -
tims said cult leaders encouraged
their followers to sell their world
ly possessions to prepare for the
end of the world that they said
would (xx in Dec. 31 because the
Ten Commandments were not
being proper!) observed. When
the end did not come, some of
the members began to ask for
their goods back.
Kataribalx), who earned a mas
ter's degree in religious studies
from Loyola Marymount Univer
sity in Los Angeles in 1987, owned
a house in Rugazi village where
155 of the buried bodies were
exhumed on March 28 and 29.
