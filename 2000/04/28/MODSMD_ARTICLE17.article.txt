NEW YORK (AP) — Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani disclosed yes
terday that he has prostate cancel
and acknowledged that while the
disease was caught early, it could
spell the end of his Senate run
against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Appearing upbeat and ener
getic at a City Hall news confer
ence, Giuliani, 55, confirmed
speculation that started Wednes
day evening when he was seen
entering a hospital and leaving
three hours later.

"1 was diagnosed yesterday,"
Giuliani said. "It's a treatable
form of prostate cancer. It was
diagnosed at an early stage."
The Republican mayor said he
would continue his Senate run for
now but would make a more
definitive statement in two to
three weeks after he decides on a
course of treatment. He still plans
campaign appearances in Sarato
ga and Buffalo today and tomor
row.
"1 really need to know what the

course of treatment is going to be
before 1 can evaluate," he said.
"And then, after I determine that,
then 1 will figure out does it make
sense this year or doesn't it or
whatever."
Treatment of the cancer would
almost certainly require as much
as several weeks away from City
Hall and off the campaign trail.
I'he first lady, who was cam
paigning in the upstate village of
I'enn Yan, spoke briefly by tele
phone with the mayor and wished

him "a speedy and complete
recovery," said Clinton
spokeswoman Karen Dunn.
Clinton did not even obliquely
criticize Giuliani, as she has done
at many of her recent campaign
appearances. Aides said that given
the news of the mayor's health,
even a veiled political attack
would have been inappropriate.
Rep. Rick who has con
sidered challenging Giuliani for
the GOF Senate nomination,
issued a statement offering his
prayers and support, adding that
health issues transcend politics.
Through his spokesman, Lazio
declined to say whether he would
enter the race if Giuliani dropped
out. I'he Senate primary is in
September.
Cancer of the prostate, is the
second most common type of can
cer in American men, but early
detection greatly increases the
chance of successful treatment.
About 179,300 men were diag
nosed with the disease in 1999.
Overall, 92 percent of victims
survive at least five years. Accord
ing to the American Cancer Soci
ety, two-thirds of men diagnosed
with the disease survive at least 10
years and half live at least 15
years.
Among those who have sur
vived prostate cancer are former
Sen. Bob Dole and New York
Yankees manager Joe Torre.
Treatments include radical
prostatectomy — removal of the
prostate — and radiation.
