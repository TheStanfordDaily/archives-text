# Clones suggest aging can be reversed

W/VSI lING'I ()N (AIM — Massachusetts sci
entists have cloned six cows that show none of
the worrisome premature aging reported tor
Dolly the sheep. In fact, (lie cows' cells seem to
have a surprisingly prolonged youth, a new
study shows.
The finding is important because it could
erase doubts about tr\ ing to use cloned cells to
light diseases, doubts raised when scientists
discovered Dolly's cells appeared older than
she was.
But the cloned cows — the oldest turned a
year old this week, while the others are 7
months old — have cells that appeal as young

as the cells of newborn calves, researchers with
the biotechnology company Advanced Cell
technologies report in Friday's edition of the
journal Science.
Unlike Dolly, the cows were cloned from
cells Hearing the end of their lifespan. If even
very old cells can have their "aging clock"
essentially rewound, then scientists might one
day be able to clone customized replacement
tissues lor patients suffering diabetes, Parkin
son's or other diseases, say experts on cellular
aging.
Does it also mean the cloned cows could live
longer than normal? Maybe, says Advanced

Clell Technologies' chief scientist, Dr. Robert
Lanza. "There's a chance these could be the
longest-lived cows on the planet."
But no one will know that for years, cau
tioned Thoru Pederson, a cellular biologist at
the University of Massachusetts Medical
School. After all, cows typically live 20 years,
and there's more to aging than the cellular
characteristic the company is investigating.
"It's important not to ovetdramatize this as
a 'fountain of youth' thing," stressed one of the
nation's leading experts on cellular aging,
Jerry Shay of the University of Texas South
western Medical Center.
