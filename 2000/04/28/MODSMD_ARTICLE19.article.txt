# U.S. economy continues rapid growth
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S.
economy grew robustly in the first three
months of this year as workers enjoyed
the biggest jump in wages and benefits in
10 years. But that sparked fresh inflation
worries among economists and investors.
The country's total output of goods
and services, called the gross domestic
product, rose at an annual rate of 5.4 per
cent during the January-Match quarter,
the Commerce Department said yester
day. Consumer spending, the locomotive
of the speeding economy, led the way by
posting its largest increase in nearly 17
years.
At the same time, an inflation gauge
tied to the GDI' rose sharply, reflecting
higher energy prices.
But what really sent shivers through
economists was a spike in workers' pay
and benefits.
They shot up 1.4 percent in the first
quartet , the biggest advance in 10 years,
the Labor Department said.
Benefits, such as higher health care
premiums and bonuses, accounted for
much of the gain. For the year ending
March 31, workers' wages and benefits
rose 4.3 percent, the biggest increase in
eight years.
That's good for workers, but
economists, including Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan, worry that il
companies pass on these rising costs to
buyers of their products, higher inflation
could be triggered.
"Hold on to your hats as Mr.
Greenspan's nightmare is beginning to
come true. Fora long time now, the Fed
chairman has been warning... that the
tight labor markets would ultimately
cause labor compensation to surge. Well,
as usual, he was light," said economist
Joel Naroff of NaroH Economic Advisors.

Amid these worries, some economists
said the Fed may boost interest rates by a
more aggressive half-point on May Hi. All
five of the Fed's rate increases since June
30 have been by a quarter-point.
"Instead of jabs, the Fed may have to
go with a sharp uppercut," said Oscar
Gonzalez, economist with John Hancock.
