Chair Kaleb Michaud, a doctoral stu
dent in physics, jointly filed six sepa
rate complaints with the Council
Wednesday evening. ASSU President
Mike Levin, a junior, joined on two of
them.
l he complaints allege a variety of
unconstitutional actions by Elections

Commission officials, Stanford Daily
reporters and editors and the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate. Those charges
include breaches of confidentiality in
c ampaign violations investigations and
restrictions on protected 112 ree speech in
campaign regulations.
The charges also attack the consti
tutionality of both the demerit system,
the Undergraduate Senate-approved
system for assessing and reporting
campaign violations, and the presi
dential/vice-presidential runoff elec
tion.
Undergraduate senator Nikki
Love, a senior, said that the confusion
over the election rules possibly
stemmed from last year's amendment
splitting the ASSU into the Under
graduate Senate and the (iSC
" fhe governing documents aren't
very clear," Love said. "There's a lot of
unclear places in the by-laws."
l he Constitutional Council, which
has never ruled on a case in its four
years of existence, will consider the
complaints in a hearing next l ues
day.
Although individuals are listed as
"defendants" in each complaint, the

Council has no authority to discipline
students.
CConstitutional Council (Chair I larris
Shapiro, a doctoral student in physics,
said the Council can only rule on the
constitutionality of actions, according
to sections 1V.2.A, 1V.2.C.4, and
1V.2.C.8 of the constitution.
"II an action is found to be unconsti
tutional, it and acts stemming from it
are null and void," he said, citing sec
tion I V.2.C.8.
Even if the Council finds that an act
violates the ASSU Constitution, the
(Council retains the option to validate
it.
"By a majority vote, the Council
may decide to deem acts stemming
from the original unconstitutional ad
as valid il they were done in good
faith."
file complaints are outlined as fol
lows.
Demerit system may be
unconstitutional
I his complaint states that all elec
tions last week voted upon by graduate
students, including elections for presi

dent/vice president, joint special fees,
graduate-only special fees and CSC is
sues must be invalid because the CSC
didn't ever approve the demerit sys
tem for elections violations.

ings ()fficer Katie Young, a junior.
Confidentiality within the demerit
system
This complaint states that the de
merit system violates the rights of the
accused to confidentiality, because sec
tion 1.4.5 of the constitution requires
that the facts of a case be kept confi
dential. Because the demerit system
was used in last week's election, the
election could be found invalid.
Elections (Commissioner Jason
Rang, a coterminal student in econom
ics who is named in a separate com
plaint, called it "ironic" that under
these same rights of the accused, the
names of those involved in the Consti
tutional (Council complaints should be
kept confidential as well.
