### JESSICA TUCKER-MOHL EDITORIAL STAFF 
Complaints filed with the ASSU
Constitutional Council could result in
an invalidation of both the current
runoff election and several parts of last
week's election.

Chair Kaleb Michaud, a doctoral stu
dent in physics, jointly filed six sepa
rate complaints with the Council
Wednesday evening. ASSU President
Mike Levin, a junior, joined on two of
them.
l he complaints allege a variety of
unconstitutional actions by Elections

Commission officials, Stanford Daily
reporters and editors and the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate. Those charges
include breaches of confidentiality in
c ampaign violations investigations and
restrictions on protected 112 ree speech in
campaign regulations.
The charges also attack the consti
tutionality of both the demerit system,
the Undergraduate Senate-approved
system for assessing and reporting
campaign violations, and the presi
dential/vice-presidential runoff elec
tion.
Undergraduate senator Nikki
Love, a senior, said that the confusion
over the election rules possibly
stemmed from last year's amendment
splitting the ASSU into the Under
graduate Senate and the (iSC
" fhe governing documents aren't
very clear," Love said. "There's a lot of
unclear places in the by-laws."
l he Constitutional Council, which
has never ruled on a case in its four
years of existence, will consider the
complaints in a hearing next l ues
day.
Although individuals are listed as
"defendants" in each complaint, the

Council has no authority to discipline
students.
CConstitutional Council (Chair I larris
Shapiro, a doctoral student in physics,
said the Council can only rule on the
constitutionality of actions, according
to sections 1V.2.A, 1V.2.C.4, and
1V.2.C.8 of the constitution.
"II an action is found to be unconsti
tutional, it and acts stemming from it
are null and void," he said, citing sec
tion I V.2.C.8.
Even if the Council finds that an act
violates the ASSU Constitution, the
(Council retains the option to validate
it.
"By a majority vote, the Council
may decide to deem acts stemming
from the original unconstitutional ad
as valid il they were done in good
faith."
file complaints are outlined as fol
lows.
Demerit system may be
unconstitutional
I his complaint states that all elec
tions last week voted upon by graduate
students, including elections for presi

dent/vice president, joint special fees,
graduate-only special fees and CSC is
sues must be invalid because the CSC
didn't ever approve the demerit sys
tem for elections violations.
l he complaint names ASSU Hear
ings ()fficer Katie Young, a junior.
Confidentiality within the demerit
system
This complaint states that the de
merit system violates the rights of the
accused to confidentiality, because sec
tion 1.4.5 of the constitution requires
that the facts of a case be kept confi
dential. Because the demerit system
was used in last week's election, the
election could be found invalid.
Elections (Commissioner Jason
Rang, a coterminal student in econom
ics who is named in a separate com
plaint, called it "ironic" that under
these same rights of the accused, the
names of those involved in the Consti
tutional (Council complaints should be
kept confidential as well.

"I don't think thevcan say we're

Kditor Mai is,i I'avlik, a sophomore,
and Stall Writer Megan Kni/e, a
freshman, vi( dated the confidential
ity of those accused during the
ASSt Hearings Commission's in
vestigations and meeting.
Unconstitutionality of runoff
election possible
Filers of the complaint allege
that the runoff election, which

began yesterday and continues
today, is unconstitutional because it
is being held before the previous
election has been certified, contrary
to constitutional requirements.
Certification of the election is
scheduled to take place at (his up
coming Tuesday's Undergraduate
Senate meeting.
"Clearly, both the Undergrad
uate Senate and the CSC validat
ed the election on Tuesday and
Wednesday," said Kang. He said
the process of certification was not
required, nor was it defined any
where in the constitution.
Kang said in a Daily April 2(i ar
ticle that, "Validation means that
the senate will critique the fairness
of the Flections Commission in de
termining the elected senate."
Validation of an election in
volves the Undergraduate Senate
and C JSC 1 voting to approve the re
sults and accepting the provisions
fora runoff. This year's election
validation occurred at this week's

Undergraduate Senate and CSC
meetings.
"Nowhere in the constitution or
in any relevant by-laws [does it]
imply that a runoff has to occur
after certification," Kang said. "I
think [the students who filed the
complaint] are confusing valida
tion and certification."
The complaint named Kang.
Creation of the Constitutional
Council
The Constitutional Council is
the ASSU's judicial arm, charged
with exerting the power of judicial
review over the actions of the ASSU
president and senate. Created as a
part of the rewrite of the constitu
tion in 1996, the Council reviewed
its first case this February, after the
Inter Varsity Craduate Christian
Fellowship requested funding from
ihe CSC. However, the case was
rendered moot when the group
withdrew its request for funding.
