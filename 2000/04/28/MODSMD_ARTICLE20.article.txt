TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iranian
hard-liners shut down three more
newspapers yesterday, including one
owned by reformist President Moham
mad Khatami's brother, pressing their
campaign against publications that
have fueled public support for reform.
Khatami's allies are being choked by
the closures, which now total 16. Only
one reformist paper remains able to
publish as crucial campaigning gets
under way for (>(> seats iti the 290-seat
parliament, or Majlis.
The Press Court, which is dominat
ed by hard-liners, said Mohammad-
Kexa Khatami's newspaper and two
others had violated press laws. It did
not detail the violations, but the pub
lisher was warned Tuesday about
printing too many daily editions.
Mohammad-Reza Khatami has
been closely allied with his brother's
campaign to loosen social, political and
cultural restrictions.
The only reformist paper still
allowed to publish is Bayan, which has
not been as outspoken as the others.
Parliament is due back in session
May 27, which would allow reformists
to restart their direct dialogue with the
people because the constitution man
dates that Parliament debates be
broadcast live on state radio.
"The reformists are under siege.
They are looking to the opening of the
Majlis as the cavalry," said Saeed Lay
la/, an analyst who used to write for the
A/ad daily that was closed down Mon

clay with a court order issued by the
hard-line judiciary.
There are clear signs the hard-liners
are trying to claw their way back into
control of the Majlis, which they lost to
the reformists in February tor the first
time since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
They have considerable power
thanks to their dominance over the
judiciary, the state broadcasting media
and the Guardians Council that super
vises elections.
So far, the Guardian Council has
annulled 12 reformist winners on spu
rious grounds, giving two seats to
hard-liners and calling for runoffs in
the others.
Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, head of
the Guardian Council, said Tuesday
there were many instances of voter
fraud and other irregularities in the 29
of 30 crucial seats won by reformists in
the capital. "There are irregularities
which mav lead to minoi c hanges," he
said.
More than two months after the
elections, the council finally announced
the results Wednesday, saying the seats
for Tehran were still in doubt but that
185 places outside the capital were con
firmed.
According to the count of the
reformist Interioi Ministry, about 120
of those seats were won by Khatami
allies — short of the 146 needed fora
simple majority.
The 29 Tehran seats would put the
reformists in firm control.
