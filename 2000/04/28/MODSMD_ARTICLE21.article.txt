## The
						Stanford Daily Band alumni donation sets good precedent 
### 
Published Since IS 1 )I

ON APRIL 13, the Stanford
Band Alumni Board handed
President Geerhard Casper a
$ 1.5-million check to fund a
new permanent director.
The money, raised entirely through
alumni donations, will lund a replacement
for legendary director Arthur Barnes who
held the post from 1903 to 1997 and was
noted for his arrangement of the "Star
Spangled Banner" and Stanford's light
song — "All Right Now."
It is wonderful to see Stanford alums
support one of the campus' most endear
ing and notable landmarks.

If you had to pick one symbol — apart
maybe from the pine tree or Hoover
lower — to represent Stanford Universi
ty, the Band would certainly rank high on
the list. Fun-loving, creative, banned from
a number of football stadiums, airlines
and even states, the Band is what Stanford
spirit is all about.
If you need proof, think back to the first
night of orientation your 112 reshman year.
You had your house meeting, you had
all introduced yourselves and your
favorite Sesame Street character to the
dorm, you may even have had time to put
the sheets on the bed.

And then it came. A wave of noise and
people engnlfed your freshman dorm and
before you knew it, you were dancing
wildly iu a fountain with a trombone play
er dressed like Carmen Miranda.
Even if you haven't jumped off the
bleachers during the refrain of "All Right
Now" or gone sprinting around campus
with the Band during one of its all-cam
pus rallies, you can take pride in the ener
gy and enthusiasm it brings to the com
munity.
The donation, certain to add an extra
infusion of energy and zaniness to the
Band, should also send a signal to other

Stanford alums.
While the Athletic Department and oth
ers receive hefty alumni donations every
year, there are a number of smaller
groups and organizations which would
benefit immensely from such funds.
While Stanford alumni have increased
donations in tlie past few years due to
extensive efforts by the University, other
groups can benefit from funding that ded
icated alumni can offer to students groups
they may once have been involved in.
Stanford's range of student groups is
quite broad, and they all need some finan
cial support now and again.
