# THE 						FLIP SIDE
## Building community 
### 
Somebody loves you on I his cam
pus. I know sometimes it feels like
you're all alone and no one cares.
Those days when your best friend
is studying fora mid-term in EDGE, the
person you're dating is busy or more like
ly, doesn't exist because you go to Stan
ford, and worst of all, you did the walk
through the Co Ho three times and you
didn't see a single person you knew.

Well, I want to
remind you that even
in these lonely times at
Stanford, there is
someone you can turn
to. There is a group of
people on this campus
who are paid 54 cents
an hour to be your
friend. I hey are Ihe

few, the proud, the res
ident assistants of Stanford University.
Yesterday, over 100 Stanford students
found out that they will he selling their
souls to Residential Kclucation as RAs for
next year. I his rambunctious group of
Stanford students will become the stal
wart figures of community, spirit and car
ing to the more than 90 percent of our

student body that lives on campus. So, in
this time of transition, 1 feel, as a second
year RA, it is my obligation to pass on
some important information to the next
year's RAs. They are eight truths that will
hopefully help you understand your job a
little bit better.
1) Charge money for the master key.
My freshmen RA charged a quarter for
the master key and made enough money
to take our entire hallway to Beppo's at
the end of Ihe year. Especially if you are a
(tosh RA, freshmen will pay for anything.
Charge them five dollars if they lock
themselves out after 10 p.m. Charge
them $20 if they lock themselves out and
they're drunk. Charge them $50 il you
open the door to the other room ate hav
ing sex (Yes, this actually happens)! |ust
charge them. It's the financial aid, you
never thought you'd get. And eventually,
they'll just stop asking lor the key.
2) Fall quarter means Green Eight!
I he reason there is no dating at Stanford
is because RAs worry about lights 100
much. Your residents want you to ask
them out. They need you to ask them

out. Who cares if they are freshmen! You
are helping them "get connected" to
Stanford. Think of the pickup lines. "I lc\
baby, let's skip the trip to M( )MA and do
some 'real' dorm programming." Or,
then there's, "What about you and me go
build some community." Or, best of all,
there's the big group pickup line, "Mas
sage circle everyone!"
3) If 65 of your freshmen who have
barely readied the age of IS are drinking
around you, and you have a huge mar

garita in your hand and a cop comes in
and says the words, "Serving alcohol to
minors, are we?" then it means you're
doing a good job! You have shown that
your community is tight-knit and the
polite have recognized youi work. Hut
remember, no matter how diunk you
are, it's von who has to watch them puke
out ilie spinach and bean enchilada that
the) had for dinnei.
4) Suites RAs don't really do anything.
I here was a rumor going around that we
actually did something last week. I hat
was a big fat lie. We have gone seven
months without doing a single thing, and
we are working hard to keep it that way.
.">) Never use the dot in topic i it) make

tree copies lor yourself. It is unethical,
irresponsible and immoral. I pride invsclf
on never having used the dorm copier foi
anything except dorm-related copying.
(i) Row RAs work hardei than all otliei
RA's. I'm not kidding. I lic\ really do. I
may ha\'e been sarcastic about olhei siiill
on this list, but those ol you thinking
you're getting off easy being a Row RA.
you're in fora little surprise. I.ile isn't as
peachy-keen on the Row as you think.
Just wait until your first house patty
when you have to explain to the cops, all
alone in a toga soaked with beer, how
three unconscious freshmen on voui
front lawn does not mean vour party is
out of control. Oct read) lor good times.

7) Remember your Iriends. If you hate
your friends, skip to No. K. Otherwise,
remember this rule. 1 I lis is mostly for
Irosli RAs. You've probably been hired
because \ou are Ã¼bei-passionate about
everything Stanlbrd. Don't get so caught
up in voui Irosli ih;ii you forget every
thing else. li s weird. I'leshnien are like a
new pet. RAs get obsessed with them at
liisi, and then tire of cleaning up alter
ihem by the end ol the yeai.
S) You are the most important and
niosi populai (1 added that second part)
people on campus. It's not easy being so
cool. You have an image to maintain so
dress appropriately. Oh yeah, and
remember thai \ou are ;i representative

of Stanford and a model for what Stan
ford students should be like, whatever
that means.
So to all the new RAs, may good luck
and good times lead you safely through
next year. For 54 cents an hour, you have
no idea what you got yourselves into. To
all tin* c urrent RAs, we've listened to peo
ple bitch, moan, scream, puke, laugh and
cry all year.
We've come a long, long way together,
through the hard times and tlie good. I
have to celebrate you RAs. I have to
praise you like I should! Congratulations
on a job well done.
