# THE
						FLIP SIDE
## Building community 
### 
Somebody loves you on I his cam
pus. I know sometimes it feels like
you're all alone and no one cares.
Those days when your best friend
is studying fora mid-term in EDGE, the
person you're dating is busy or more like
ly, doesn't exist because you go to Stan
ford, and worst of all, you did the walk
through the Co Ho three times and you
didn't see a single person you knew.

Well, I want to
remind you that even
in these lonely times at
Stanford, there is
someone you can turn
to. There is a group of
people on this campus
who are paid 54 cents
an hour to be your
friend. I hey are Ihe

few, the proud, the res
ident assistants of Stanford University.
Yesterday, over 100 Stanford students
found out that they will he selling their
souls to Residential Kclucation as RAs for
next year. I his rambunctious group of
Stanford students will become the stal
wart figures of community, spirit and car
ing to the more than 90 percent of our

student body that lives on campus. So, in
this time of transition, 1 feel, as a second
year RA, it is my obligation to pass on
some important information to the next
year's RAs. They are eight truths that will
hopefully help you understand your job a
little bit better.
1) Charge money for the master key.
My freshmen RA charged a quarter for
the master key and made enough money
to take our entire hallway to Beppo's at
the end of Ihe year. Especially if you are a
(tosh RA, freshmen will pay for anything.
Charge them five dollars if they lock
themselves out after 10 p.m. Charge
them $20 if they lock themselves out and
they're drunk. Charge them $50 il you
open the door to the other room ate hav
ing sex (Yes, this actually happens)! |ust
charge them. It's the financial aid, you
never thought you'd get. And eventually,
they'll just stop asking lor the key.
2) Fall quarter means Green Eight!
I he reason there is no dating at Stanford
is because RAs worry about lights 100
much. Your residents want you to ask
them out. They need you to ask them
