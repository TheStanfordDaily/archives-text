Defending Hennessy
The opinions page (April 27) had a
letter entitled "Media out of control."
This certainly applies to the editorial
("Hennessy's recent comments raise
concern") above it. The editor is obvi
ously waiting, or not waiting, for an
opportunity to tweak the nose of
authority. President-elect I lennessy is a
kind, sensitive individual, and it is gross
ly unfair to attack him in this way even
before he assumes office. The good
thing is that the editorial will make
decent people feel sympathetic toward
him.

Srinivasan misses point
In Tuesday's letter, "'Janitors' col
umn misses the point," Balaji Srinivasan
presents a simplistic "that's the way it is"
view of the reasons for low-wage work
and offends the dignity of hard-working
janitors with his disingenous prescrip
tions to help them out of poverty.
Mr. Srinivisan tells us that janitors
are doomed to work for low-wages

because they are easily replaced. In
point of fact, 8,500 janitors in Los Ange
les concluded a three-week strike on
Monday in which they secured a $1.90
raise over three years and a $500
return-to-work bonus. None of them
lost their jobs. Because they belong to a
union, these janitors were able to bar
gain collectively with their employer to
improve their working conditions.
The decision to strike involves per
sonal sacrifices that workers will not
make unless they feel that their
demands are both just and realistic. Our
society recognizes that union represen
tation and the right to strike are funda
mental rights of working people pro
tected by the National Labor Relations
Board. The people of Los Angeles rec
ognized that hard-working janitors
deserve fair compensation, and that
businesses can afford to give it to them.
There was widespread community sup
port for the janitors' campaign in L.A.:
community food banks were set up and
public figures, such as Senator Dianne
Feinstein, Al Gore and L.A.'s Republi
can Mayor Richard Riordan, went on
record to show their support. Kven
some building and business owners
acknowledged that the janitors'

demands were reasonable.
In Silicon Valley, the ease is not much
different. Mr. Srinivasan's suggestion
that activists would need to "fork over
$400 of their personal funds" to raise jan
itors' salaries demonstrates Srinivasan's
misunderstanding of the relations
between client and contractor in the jan
itorial industry. First, it is not clear that
such an increase would make janitorial
companies less competitive. 1 lie janitors'
union negotiates a "master contract" with
many contracting companies at once,
thus allowing unionized contractcrs to
keep their prices in line with one anoth
er. In general, the competitive bidding
process among contractors prevents dra
matic rises in the price of bids. Second, it
is unlikely that janitorial wage increases
would be passed onto students. Stanford
University has an endowment of Over $0
billion, which generates over $250 mil
lion in interest annually. Only a small
portion (17 percent) of Stanford's rev
enue conies from student tuition and
fees, and of that, less than 1 percent goes
to the wages of maintenance staff.
At Johns Johns Hopkins University,
President William Brody has instituted a
"living wage" of $7.75 for all University
employees, and students there have not

seen a tuition hike. Stanford sits at the
top of an employment chain with
respect to its janitors. Stanford can
afford to pay the slight price increases
that may result from paying janitors a
decent wage.
While it is true that people possess
varying degrees and kinds of skills, Mr.
Srinivasan's argument that income
inequality is based on "differences in
people that will not go away" is both
uninformed and disrespectful. First of
all. it is not clear that the janitors' skill
level or productivity determines their
pay. Fifteen years ago, janitors made
today's equivalent ofs 12 an hour. Their
productivity has not gone down since
then. What has changed is that they
have been outsourced, introducing a
middle-man between janitors and the
buildings they clean, and their pay has
gone clown accordingly.
The fact that students receive higher
wages than non-students does not
reflect a difference in skill level. Fven
when working side by side in dining
halls, performing the same jobs, student
hashers earn more than their non-stu
dent counterparts. The subsidized stu
dent wage reflects a commitment on the
part of Stanford to help students 112 inance

their education. Stanford should make a
similar commitment to ensuring that the
people who maintain the university
receive a wage that meets their needs.
Low-skilled jobs are both valuable
and necessary, and workers in these jobs
should be rewarded for their hard work.
Even though, as Mr. Srinivasan has
pointed out, someone will always be on
the bottom of the income ladder, this
bottom need not leave working families
below the poverty line.
It is outrageous to suggest, as Mr.
Srinivasan does, that those who work at
low-wage jobs on this campus are not
capable of making decisions for them
selves. In order to survive on some of the
wages paid, people must be incredibly
shrewd. Supporting the efforts of janitors
on this campus is not "white-upperclass
guilt politics." Those who support the
janitors represent a diverse group of
workers, community members, faculty
and students — not to mention the jani
tors themselves. Let's be clear that the
janitors themselves are the ones who
organized, went on strike in Los Angeles
and won a wage increase and bonus.
Their allies are merely supporters — not
the main force in their struggles for jus
tice. We all have dillerent reasons for
supporting tlieni — some of us have rel
atives and friends who are janitors or
work at similarly low-paid jobs. Some of
us hold or have belt I these jobs oui selves.
Some of us simply believe that janitors
deserve to be rewarded fairly for theii
hard work, and that Stanford, as a respon
sible institution, should make a commit
ment to a living wage for its workers.

Defending Srinivasan's views
As expected, Balaji Srinivasan's
recent letter to the editor prompted a
stream of self-righteous indignation
from the activists campaigning for high
er janitorial wages, all of which have
made for highly entertaining reading.
Unfortunately, these masters of feel
good rhetoric and catchy slogans (to the
activists: "No pasaran!" is a reallv origi
nal one you can use next time) failed to
address the main point of Mr. Niini
vasan's letter. Money does not grow on
trees. Stanford doesn't have an illegal
printing press stashed in the basement
of Old Union. The extra wages that
these activists are demanding be paid to
the janitors have to come fioni some
where. And in all likelihood, th.it nione\
will come from the students' pockets.
Now, how many of you like to pax
higher tuition? Judging b\ the (lamoi
ever)' time the Hoard of 1 rustees passes
another tuition hike, most of you don't.
In order to avoid this sort ol h)poc i isy,
the activists pressing foi higliei wages
have two choices. Hither they need to
put their wallets where their mouths are
and ask the Board ol 1 rustees lor a
tuition hike that will specificallv go to a
janitors' fund, or they need to seriously
rethink the basis for their protests. It is
very easy to protest when the end result
of the actions that one is requesting will
not adversely impact one's financial sta
tus (or one's monmiie and daddies
financial status), it is an entirely differ

eni matter to tit) so when one is willing
it) back up words with dollar bills.
Finally, lest I be accused ol being a
heartless capitalist pig by the restless
proletariat in White I'la/a, I would like
10 sa\ that I would be absolutely thrilled
11 Ihe janitors were paid salaries on the
st ale of those paid to dot-com computer
programmers. Unfortunately, no one in
this world "deserves" a salar\ just by
one's mere existence, one earns a salary
based on how much the rest ol I lie

tlouhl that janitors work hard, and quite

Professor Emnttus

Srinivasan misses point
In Tuesday's letter, "'Janitors' col
umn misses the point," Balaji Srinivasan
presents a simplistic "that's the way it is"
view of the reasons for low-wage work
and offends the dignity of hard-working
janitors with his disingenous prescrip
tions to help them out of poverty.
Mr. Srinivisan tells us that janitors
are doomed to work for low-wages

because they are easily replaced. In
point of fact, 8,500 janitors in Los Ange
les concluded a three-week strike on
Monday in which they secured a $1.90
raise over three years and a $500
return-to-work bonus. None of them
lost their jobs. Because they belong to a
union, these janitors were able to bar
gain collectively with their employer to
improve their working conditions.
The decision to strike involves per
sonal sacrifices that workers will not
make unless they feel that their
demands are both just and realistic. Our
society recognizes that union represen
tation and the right to strike are funda
mental rights of working people pro
tected by the National Labor Relations
Board. The people of Los Angeles rec
ognized that hard-working janitors
deserve fair compensation, and that
businesses can afford to give it to them.
There was widespread community sup
port for the janitors' campaign in L.A.:
community food banks were set up and
public figures, such as Senator Dianne
Feinstein, Al Gore and L.A.'s Republi
can Mayor Richard Riordan, went on
record to show their support. Kven
some building and business owners
acknowledged that the janitors'

demands were reasonable.
In Silicon Valley, the ease is not much
different. Mr. Srinivasan's suggestion
that activists would need to "fork over
$400 of their personal funds" to raise jan
itors' salaries demonstrates Srinivasan's
misunderstanding of the relations
between client and contractor in the jan
itorial industry. First, it is not clear that
such an increase would make janitorial
companies less competitive. 1 lie janitors'
union negotiates a "master contract" with
many contracting companies at once,
thus allowing unionized contractcrs to
keep their prices in line with one anoth
er. In general, the competitive bidding
process among contractors prevents dra
matic rises in the price of bids. Second, it
is unlikely that janitorial wage increases
would be passed onto students. Stanford
University has an endowment of Over $0
billion, which generates over $250 mil
lion in interest annually. Only a small
portion (17 percent) of Stanford's rev
enue conies from student tuition and
fees, and of that, less than 1 percent goes
to the wages of maintenance staff.
At Johns Johns Hopkins University,
President William Brody has instituted a
"living wage" of $7.75 for all University
employees, and students there have not

seen a tuition hike. Stanford sits at the
top of an employment chain with
respect to its janitors. Stanford can
afford to pay the slight price increases
that may result from paying janitors a
decent wage.
While it is true that people possess
varying degrees and kinds of skills, Mr.
Srinivasan's argument that income
inequality is based on "differences in
people that will not go away" is both
uninformed and disrespectful. First of
all. it is not clear that the janitors' skill
level or productivity determines their
pay. Fifteen years ago, janitors made
today's equivalent ofs 12 an hour. Their
productivity has not gone down since
then. What has changed is that they
have been outsourced, introducing a
middle-man between janitors and the
buildings they clean, and their pay has
gone clown accordingly.
The fact that students receive higher
wages than non-students does not
reflect a difference in skill level. Fven
when working side by side in dining
halls, performing the same jobs, student
hashers earn more than their non-stu
dent counterparts. The subsidized stu
dent wage reflects a commitment on the
part of Stanford to help students 112 inance

their education. Stanford should make a
similar commitment to ensuring that the
people who maintain the university
receive a wage that meets their needs.
Low-skilled jobs are both valuable
and necessary, and workers in these jobs
should be rewarded for their hard work.
Even though, as Mr. Srinivasan has
pointed out, someone will always be on
the bottom of the income ladder, this
bottom need not leave working families
below the poverty line.
It is outrageous to suggest, as Mr.
Srinivasan does, that those who work at
low-wage jobs on this campus are not
capable of making decisions for them
selves. In order to survive on some of the
wages paid, people must be incredibly
shrewd. Supporting the efforts of janitors
on this campus is not "white-upperclass
guilt politics." Those who support the
janitors represent a diverse group of
workers, community members, faculty
and students — not to mention the jani
tors themselves. Let's be clear that the
janitors themselves are the ones who
organized, went on strike in Los Angeles
and won a wage increase and bonus.
Their allies are merely supporters — not
the main force in their struggles for jus
tice. We all have dillerent reasons for
supporting tlieni — some of us have rel
atives and friends who are janitors or
work at similarly low-paid jobs. Some of
us hold or have belt I these jobs oui selves.
Some of us simply believe that janitors
deserve to be rewarded fairly for theii
hard work, and that Stanford, as a respon
sible institution, should make a commit
ment to a living wage for its workers.

Members of the Elections Commission

of the ASSU.
We recently learned that you have filed
charges with the Constitutional Council
against the Undergraduate Senate, the
Elections Commission and The Stanford

\\'e have spent a lot of time reviewing
the charges and reflecting on recent
events. We believe that some of the
charges are motivated bv personal tensions
and partisan concerns, and others by a
genuine desire to strictlv uphold the ASSU
Constitution. We acknowledge that some
mistakes w ere made and we are dedicated
to correcting those for future elections.
However, we believe everything this

decision to involve the Constitutional

Association.
In keeping with the true goals of the
ASSU election — allowing ..the. siutlvut

against all named parties, put aside emo

RONALI) HILTON
Professor Emnttus

Srinivasan misses point
In Tuesday's letter, "'Janitors' col
umn misses the point," Balaji Srinivasan
presents a simplistic "that's the way it is"
view of the reasons for low-wage work
and offends the dignity of hard-working
janitors with his disingenous prescrip
tions to help them out of poverty.
Mr. Srinivisan tells us that janitors
are doomed to work for low-wages

because they are easily replaced. In
point of fact, 8,500 janitors in Los Ange
les concluded a three-week strike on
Monday in which they secured a $1.90
raise over three years and a $500
return-to-work bonus. None of them
lost their jobs. Because they belong to a
union, these janitors were able to bar
gain collectively with their employer to
improve their working conditions.
The decision to strike involves per
sonal sacrifices that workers will not
make unless they feel that their
demands are both just and realistic. Our
society recognizes that union represen
tation and the right to strike are funda
mental rights of working people pro
tected by the National Labor Relations
Board. The people of Los Angeles rec
ognized that hard-working janitors
deserve fair compensation, and that
businesses can afford to give it to them.
There was widespread community sup
port for the janitors' campaign in L.A.:
community food banks were set up and
public figures, such as Senator Dianne
Feinstein, Al Gore and L.A.'s Republi
can Mayor Richard Riordan, went on
record to show their support. Kven
some building and business owners
acknowledged that the janitors'

demands were reasonable.
In Silicon Valley, the ease is not much
different. Mr. Srinivasan's suggestion
that activists would need to "fork over
$400 of their personal funds" to raise jan
itors' salaries demonstrates Srinivasan's
misunderstanding of the relations
between client and contractor in the jan
itorial industry. First, it is not clear that
such an increase would make janitorial
companies less competitive. 1 lie janitors'
union negotiates a "master contract" with
many contracting companies at once,
thus allowing unionized contractcrs to
keep their prices in line with one anoth
er. In general, the competitive bidding
process among contractors prevents dra
matic rises in the price of bids. Second, it
is unlikely that janitorial wage increases
would be passed onto students. Stanford
University has an endowment of Over $0
billion, which generates over $250 mil
lion in interest annually. Only a small
portion (17 percent) of Stanford's rev
enue conies from student tuition and
fees, and of that, less than 1 percent goes
to the wages of maintenance staff.
At Johns Johns Hopkins University,
President William Brody has instituted a
"living wage" of $7.75 for all University
employees, and students there have not

seen a tuition hike. Stanford sits at the
top of an employment chain with
respect to its janitors. Stanford can
afford to pay the slight price increases
that may result from paying janitors a
decent wage.
While it is true that people possess
varying degrees and kinds of skills, Mr.
Srinivasan's argument that income
inequality is based on "differences in
people that will not go away" is both
uninformed and disrespectful. First of
all. it is not clear that the janitors' skill
level or productivity determines their
pay. Fifteen years ago, janitors made
today's equivalent ofs 12 an hour. Their
productivity has not gone down since
then. What has changed is that they
have been outsourced, introducing a
middle-man between janitors and the
buildings they clean, and their pay has
gone clown accordingly.
The fact that students receive higher
wages than non-students does not
reflect a difference in skill level. Fven
when working side by side in dining
halls, performing the same jobs, student
hashers earn more than their non-stu
dent counterparts. The subsidized stu
dent wage reflects a commitment on the
part of Stanford to help students 112 inance

their education. Stanford should make a
similar commitment to ensuring that the
people who maintain the university
receive a wage that meets their needs.
Low-skilled jobs are both valuable
and necessary, and workers in these jobs
should be rewarded for their hard work.
Even though, as Mr. Srinivasan has
pointed out, someone will always be on
the bottom of the income ladder, this
bottom need not leave working families
below the poverty line.
It is outrageous to suggest, as Mr.
Srinivasan does, that those who work at
low-wage jobs on this campus are not
capable of making decisions for them
selves. In order to survive on some of the
wages paid, people must be incredibly
shrewd. Supporting the efforts of janitors
on this campus is not "white-upperclass
guilt politics." Those who support the
janitors represent a diverse group of
workers, community members, faculty
and students — not to mention the jani
tors themselves. Let's be clear that the
janitors themselves are the ones who
organized, went on strike in Los Angeles
and won a wage increase and bonus.
Their allies are merely supporters — not
the main force in their struggles for jus
tice. We all have dillerent reasons for
supporting tlieni — some of us have rel
atives and friends who are janitors or
work at similarly low-paid jobs. Some of
us hold or have belt I these jobs oui selves.
Some of us simply believe that janitors
deserve to be rewarded fairly for theii
hard work, and that Stanford, as a respon
sible institution, should make a commit
ment to a living wage for its workers.

Defending Srinivasan's views
As expected, Balaji Srinivasan's
recent letter to the editor prompted a
stream of self-righteous indignation
from the activists campaigning for high
er janitorial wages, all of which have
made for highly entertaining reading.
Unfortunately, these masters of feel
good rhetoric and catchy slogans (to the
activists: "No pasaran!" is a reallv origi
nal one you can use next time) failed to
address the main point of Mr. Niini
vasan's letter. Money does not grow on
trees. Stanford doesn't have an illegal
printing press stashed in the basement
of Old Union. The extra wages that
these activists are demanding be paid to
the janitors have to come fioni some
where. And in all likelihood, th.it nione\
will come from the students' pockets.
Now, how many of you like to pax
higher tuition? Judging b\ the (lamoi
ever)' time the Hoard of 1 rustees passes
another tuition hike, most of you don't.
In order to avoid this sort ol h)poc i isy,
the activists pressing foi higliei wages
have two choices. Hither they need to
put their wallets where their mouths are
and ask the Board ol 1 rustees lor a
tuition hike that will specificallv go to a
janitors' fund, or they need to seriously
rethink the basis for their protests. It is
very easy to protest when the end result
of the actions that one is requesting will
not adversely impact one's financial sta
tus (or one's monmiie and daddies
financial status), it is an entirely differ

eni matter to tit) so when one is willing
it) back up words with dollar bills.
Finally, lest I be accused ol being a
heartless capitalist pig by the restless
proletariat in White I'la/a, I would like
10 sa\ that I would be absolutely thrilled
11 Ihe janitors were paid salaries on the
st ale of those paid to dot-com computer
programmers. Unfortunately, no one in
this world "deserves" a salar\ just by
one's mere existence, one earns a salary
based on how much the rest ol I lie
world values ones labor. I have no
tlouhl that janitors work hard, and quite
a few of them are intelligent human
beings who simph had no opportunity
it) get an education, but it is a sad fact of
life that unskilled labor simply doesn't
pay much and no amount ol "from
each according to his ability, it) each
actoiding to his need will change that.

Professor Emnttus

Srinivasan misses point
In Tuesday's letter, "'Janitors' col
umn misses the point," Balaji Srinivasan
presents a simplistic "that's the way it is"
view of the reasons for low-wage work
and offends the dignity of hard-working
janitors with his disingenous prescrip
tions to help them out of poverty.
Mr. Srinivisan tells us that janitors
are doomed to work for low-wages

because they are easily replaced. In
point of fact, 8,500 janitors in Los Ange
les concluded a three-week strike on
Monday in which they secured a $1.90
raise over three years and a $500
return-to-work bonus. None of them
lost their jobs. Because they belong to a
union, these janitors were able to bar
gain collectively with their employer to
improve their working conditions.
The decision to strike involves per
sonal sacrifices that workers will not
make unless they feel that their
demands are both just and realistic. Our
society recognizes that union represen
tation and the right to strike are funda
mental rights of working people pro
tected by the National Labor Relations
Board. The people of Los Angeles rec
ognized that hard-working janitors
deserve fair compensation, and that
businesses can afford to give it to them.
There was widespread community sup
port for the janitors' campaign in L.A.:
community food banks were set up and
public figures, such as Senator Dianne
Feinstein, Al Gore and L.A.'s Republi
can Mayor Richard Riordan, went on
record to show their support. Kven
some building and business owners
acknowledged that the janitors'

demands were reasonable.
In Silicon Valley, the ease is not much
different. Mr. Srinivasan's suggestion
that activists would need to "fork over
$400 of their personal funds" to raise jan
itors' salaries demonstrates Srinivasan's
misunderstanding of the relations
between client and contractor in the jan
itorial industry. First, it is not clear that
such an increase would make janitorial
companies less competitive. 1 lie janitors'
union negotiates a "master contract" with
many contracting companies at once,
thus allowing unionized contractcrs to
keep their prices in line with one anoth
er. In general, the competitive bidding
process among contractors prevents dra
matic rises in the price of bids. Second, it
is unlikely that janitorial wage increases
would be passed onto students. Stanford
University has an endowment of Over $0
billion, which generates over $250 mil
lion in interest annually. Only a small
portion (17 percent) of Stanford's rev
enue conies from student tuition and
fees, and of that, less than 1 percent goes
to the wages of maintenance staff.
At Johns Johns Hopkins University,
President William Brody has instituted a
"living wage" of $7.75 for all University
employees, and students there have not

seen a tuition hike. Stanford sits at the
top of an employment chain with
respect to its janitors. Stanford can
afford to pay the slight price increases
that may result from paying janitors a
decent wage.
While it is true that people possess
varying degrees and kinds of skills, Mr.
Srinivasan's argument that income
inequality is based on "differences in
people that will not go away" is both
uninformed and disrespectful. First of
all. it is not clear that the janitors' skill
level or productivity determines their
pay. Fifteen years ago, janitors made
today's equivalent ofs 12 an hour. Their
productivity has not gone down since
then. What has changed is that they
have been outsourced, introducing a
middle-man between janitors and the
buildings they clean, and their pay has
gone clown accordingly.
The fact that students receive higher
wages than non-students does not
reflect a difference in skill level. Fven
when working side by side in dining
halls, performing the same jobs, student
hashers earn more than their non-stu
dent counterparts. The subsidized stu
dent wage reflects a commitment on the
part of Stanford to help students 112 inance

their education. Stanford should make a
similar commitment to ensuring that the
people who maintain the university
receive a wage that meets their needs.
Low-skilled jobs are both valuable
and necessary, and workers in these jobs
should be rewarded for their hard work.
Even though, as Mr. Srinivasan has
pointed out, someone will always be on
the bottom of the income ladder, this
bottom need not leave working families
below the poverty line.
It is outrageous to suggest, as Mr.
Srinivasan does, that those who work at
low-wage jobs on this campus are not
capable of making decisions for them
selves. In order to survive on some of the
wages paid, people must be incredibly
shrewd. Supporting the efforts of janitors
on this campus is not "white-upperclass
guilt politics." Those who support the
janitors represent a diverse group of
workers, community members, faculty
and students — not to mention the jani
tors themselves. Let's be clear that the
janitors themselves are the ones who
organized, went on strike in Los Angeles
and won a wage increase and bonus.
Their allies are merely supporters — not
the main force in their struggles for jus
tice. We all have dillerent reasons for
supporting tlieni — some of us have rel
atives and friends who are janitors or
work at similarly low-paid jobs. Some of
us hold or have belt I these jobs oui selves.
Some of us simply believe that janitors
deserve to be rewarded fairly for theii
hard work, and that Stanford, as a respon
sible institution, should make a commit
ment to a living wage for its workers.

Defending Srinivasan's views
As expected, Balaji Srinivasan's
recent letter to the editor prompted a
stream of self-righteous indignation
from the activists campaigning for high
er janitorial wages, all of which have
made for highly entertaining reading.
Unfortunately, these masters of feel
good rhetoric and catchy slogans (to the
activists: "No pasaran!" is a reallv origi
nal one you can use next time) failed to
address the main point of Mr. Niini
vasan's letter. Money does not grow on
trees. Stanford doesn't have an illegal
printing press stashed in the basement
of Old Union. The extra wages that
these activists are demanding be paid to
the janitors have to come fioni some
where. And in all likelihood, th.it nione\
will come from the students' pockets.
Now, how many of you like to pax
higher tuition? Judging b\ the (lamoi
ever)' time the Hoard of 1 rustees passes
another tuition hike, most of you don't.
In order to avoid this sort ol h)poc i isy,
the activists pressing foi higliei wages
have two choices. Hither they need to
put their wallets where their mouths are
and ask the Board ol 1 rustees lor a
tuition hike that will specificallv go to a
janitors' fund, or they need to seriously
rethink the basis for their protests. It is
very easy to protest when the end result
of the actions that one is requesting will
not adversely impact one's financial sta
tus (or one's monmiie and daddies
financial status), it is an entirely differ

eni matter to tit) so when one is willing
it) back up words with dollar bills.
Finally, lest I be accused ol being a
heartless capitalist pig by the restless
proletariat in White I'la/a, I would like
10 sa\ that I would be absolutely thrilled
11 Ihe janitors were paid salaries on the
st ale of those paid to dot-com computer
programmers. Unfortunately, no one in
this world "deserves" a salar\ just by
one's mere existence, one earns a salary
based on how much the rest ol I lie

tlouhl that janitors work hard, and quite

We recently learned that you have filed

\\'e have spent a lot of time reviewing

genuine desire to strictlv uphold the ASSU

mistakes w ere made and we are dedicated
to correcting those for future elections.
However, we believe everything this

In keeping with the true goals of the

RONALI) HILTON
Professor Emnttus

Srinivasan misses point
In Tuesday's letter, "'Janitors' col
umn misses the point," Balaji Srinivasan
presents a simplistic "that's the way it is"
view of the reasons for low-wage work
and offends the dignity of hard-working
janitors with his disingenous prescrip
tions to help them out of poverty.
Mr. Srinivisan tells us that janitors
are doomed to work for low-wages

because they are easily replaced. In
point of fact, 8,500 janitors in Los Ange
les concluded a three-week strike on
Monday in which they secured a $1.90
raise over three years and a $500
return-to-work bonus. None of them
lost their jobs. Because they belong to a
union, these janitors were able to bar
gain collectively with their employer to
improve their working conditions.
The decision to strike involves per
sonal sacrifices that workers will not
make unless they feel that their
demands are both just and realistic. Our
society recognizes that union represen
tation and the right to strike are funda
mental rights of working people pro
tected by the National Labor Relations
Board. The people of Los Angeles rec
ognized that hard-working janitors
deserve fair compensation, and that
businesses can afford to give it to them.
There was widespread community sup
port for the janitors' campaign in L.A.:
community food banks were set up and
public figures, such as Senator Dianne
Feinstein, Al Gore and L.A.'s Republi
can Mayor Richard Riordan, went on
record to show their support. Kven
some building and business owners
acknowledged that the janitors'

demands were reasonable.
In Silicon Valley, the ease is not much
different. Mr. Srinivasan's suggestion
that activists would need to "fork over
$400 of their personal funds" to raise jan
itors' salaries demonstrates Srinivasan's
misunderstanding of the relations
between client and contractor in the jan
itorial industry. First, it is not clear that
such an increase would make janitorial
companies less competitive. 1 lie janitors'
union negotiates a "master contract" with
many contracting companies at once,
thus allowing unionized contractcrs to
keep their prices in line with one anoth
er. In general, the competitive bidding
process among contractors prevents dra
matic rises in the price of bids. Second, it
is unlikely that janitorial wage increases
would be passed onto students. Stanford
University has an endowment of Over $0
billion, which generates over $250 mil
lion in interest annually. Only a small
portion (17 percent) of Stanford's rev
enue conies from student tuition and
fees, and of that, less than 1 percent goes
to the wages of maintenance staff.
At Johns Johns Hopkins University,
President William Brody has instituted a
"living wage" of $7.75 for all University
employees, and students there have not

seen a tuition hike. Stanford sits at the
top of an employment chain with
respect to its janitors. Stanford can
afford to pay the slight price increases
that may result from paying janitors a
decent wage.
While it is true that people possess
varying degrees and kinds of skills, Mr.
Srinivasan's argument that income
inequality is based on "differences in
people that will not go away" is both
uninformed and disrespectful. First of
all. it is not clear that the janitors' skill
level or productivity determines their
pay. Fifteen years ago, janitors made
today's equivalent ofs 12 an hour. Their
productivity has not gone down since
then. What has changed is that they
have been outsourced, introducing a
middle-man between janitors and the
buildings they clean, and their pay has
gone clown accordingly.
The fact that students receive higher
wages than non-students does not
reflect a difference in skill level. Fven
when working side by side in dining
halls, performing the same jobs, student
hashers earn more than their non-stu
dent counterparts. The subsidized stu
dent wage reflects a commitment on the
part of Stanford to help students 112 inance

their education. Stanford should make a
similar commitment to ensuring that the
people who maintain the university
receive a wage that meets their needs.
Low-skilled jobs are both valuable
and necessary, and workers in these jobs
should be rewarded for their hard work.
Even though, as Mr. Srinivasan has
pointed out, someone will always be on
the bottom of the income ladder, this
bottom need not leave working families
below the poverty line.
It is outrageous to suggest, as Mr.
Srinivasan does, that those who work at
low-wage jobs on this campus are not
capable of making decisions for them
selves. In order to survive on some of the
wages paid, people must be incredibly
shrewd. Supporting the efforts of janitors
on this campus is not "white-upperclass
guilt politics." Those who support the
janitors represent a diverse group of
workers, community members, faculty
and students — not to mention the jani
tors themselves. Let's be clear that the
janitors themselves are the ones who
organized, went on strike in Los Angeles
and won a wage increase and bonus.
Their allies are merely supporters — not
the main force in their struggles for jus
tice. We all have dillerent reasons for
supporting tlieni — some of us have rel
atives and friends who are janitors or
work at similarly low-paid jobs. Some of
us hold or have belt I these jobs oui selves.
Some of us simply believe that janitors
deserve to be rewarded fairly for theii
hard work, and that Stanford, as a respon
sible institution, should make a commit
ment to a living wage for its workers.

janitors in the Bay Area, come to White

Senators' plea to finish the election
This is an Open Letter to ASS I Presi
dent Mike Levin and CSC Members Paul
I I.irtke. Kaleh Midland, Michael Bartsch,
Hunter 1 'art and Pai-Ling Yin:
Members of the Elections Commission
and the I ndergraduate Senate met yes
terday because we are extremely con
cerned about this election and the future
of the ASSU.
We recently learned that you have filed
charges with the Constitutional Council
against the Undergraduate Senate, the
Elections Commission and The Stanford
Daily.
\\'e have spent a lot of time reviewing
the charges and reflecting on recent
events. We believe that some of the
charges are motivated bv personal tensions
and partisan concerns, and others by a
genuine desire to strictlv uphold the ASSU
Constitution. We acknowledge that some
mistakes w ere made and we are dedicated
to correcting those for future elections.
However, we believe everything this
spring was done in good faith, and your
decision to involve the Constitutional
Council is not in the best interest of the
Association.
In keeping with the true goals of the
ASSU election — allowing ..the. siutlvut
body to choose theit elected lepresuuia
tives —we ask that vou drop tlit* charges
against all named parties, put aside emo
tions and partisanship now and allow the
results of this election and runoff to stand.

Defending Hennessy
The opinions page (April 27) had a
letter entitled "Media out of control."
This certainly applies to the editorial
("Hennessy's recent comments raise
concern") above it. The editor is obvi
ously waiting, or not waiting, for an
opportunity to tweak the nose of
authority. President-elect I lennessy is a
kind, sensitive individual, and it is gross
ly unfair to attack him in this way even
before he assumes office. The good
thing is that the editorial will make
decent people feel sympathetic toward
him.

Srinivasan misses point
In Tuesday's letter, "'Janitors' col
umn misses the point," Balaji Srinivasan
presents a simplistic "that's the way it is"
view of the reasons for low-wage work
and offends the dignity of hard-working
janitors with his disingenous prescrip
tions to help them out of poverty.
Mr. Srinivisan tells us that janitors
are doomed to work for low-wages

because they are easily replaced. In
point of fact, 8,500 janitors in Los Ange
les concluded a three-week strike on
Monday in which they secured a $1.90
raise over three years and a $500
return-to-work bonus. None of them
lost their jobs. Because they belong to a
union, these janitors were able to bar
gain collectively with their employer to
improve their working conditions.
The decision to strike involves per
sonal sacrifices that workers will not
make unless they feel that their
demands are both just and realistic. Our
society recognizes that union represen
tation and the right to strike are funda
mental rights of working people pro
tected by the National Labor Relations
Board. The people of Los Angeles rec
ognized that hard-working janitors
deserve fair compensation, and that
businesses can afford to give it to them.
There was widespread community sup
port for the janitors' campaign in L.A.:
community food banks were set up and
public figures, such as Senator Dianne
Feinstein, Al Gore and L.A.'s Republi
can Mayor Richard Riordan, went on
record to show their support. Kven
some building and business owners
acknowledged that the janitors'

demands were reasonable.
In Silicon Valley, the ease is not much
different. Mr. Srinivasan's suggestion
that activists would need to "fork over
$400 of their personal funds" to raise jan
itors' salaries demonstrates Srinivasan's
misunderstanding of the relations
between client and contractor in the jan
itorial industry. First, it is not clear that
such an increase would make janitorial
companies less competitive. 1 lie janitors'
union negotiates a "master contract" with
many contracting companies at once,
thus allowing unionized contractcrs to
keep their prices in line with one anoth
er. In general, the competitive bidding
process among contractors prevents dra
matic rises in the price of bids. Second, it
is unlikely that janitorial wage increases
would be passed onto students. Stanford
University has an endowment of Over $0
billion, which generates over $250 mil
lion in interest annually. Only a small
portion (17 percent) of Stanford's rev
enue conies from student tuition and
fees, and of that, less than 1 percent goes
to the wages of maintenance staff.
At Johns Johns Hopkins University,
President William Brody has instituted a
"living wage" of $7.75 for all University
employees, and students there have not

seen a tuition hike. Stanford sits at the
top of an employment chain with
respect to its janitors. Stanford can
afford to pay the slight price increases
that may result from paying janitors a
decent wage.
While it is true that people possess
varying degrees and kinds of skills, Mr.
Srinivasan's argument that income
inequality is based on "differences in
people that will not go away" is both
uninformed and disrespectful. First of
all. it is not clear that the janitors' skill
level or productivity determines their
pay. Fifteen years ago, janitors made
today's equivalent ofs 12 an hour. Their
productivity has not gone down since
then. What has changed is that they
have been outsourced, introducing a
middle-man between janitors and the
buildings they clean, and their pay has
gone clown accordingly.
The fact that students receive higher
wages than non-students does not
reflect a difference in skill level. Fven
when working side by side in dining
halls, performing the same jobs, student
hashers earn more than their non-stu
dent counterparts. The subsidized stu
dent wage reflects a commitment on the
part of Stanford to help students 112 inance

their education. Stanford should make a
similar commitment to ensuring that the
people who maintain the university
receive a wage that meets their needs.
Low-skilled jobs are both valuable
and necessary, and workers in these jobs
should be rewarded for their hard work.
Even though, as Mr. Srinivasan has
pointed out, someone will always be on
the bottom of the income ladder, this
bottom need not leave working families
below the poverty line.
It is outrageous to suggest, as Mr.
Srinivasan does, that those who work at
low-wage jobs on this campus are not
capable of making decisions for them
selves. In order to survive on some of the
wages paid, people must be incredibly
shrewd. Supporting the efforts of janitors
on this campus is not "white-upperclass
guilt politics." Those who support the
janitors represent a diverse group of
workers, community members, faculty
and students — not to mention the jani
tors themselves. Let's be clear that the
janitors themselves are the ones who
organized, went on strike in Los Angeles
and won a wage increase and bonus.
Their allies are merely supporters — not
the main force in their struggles for jus
tice. We all have dillerent reasons for
supporting tlieni — some of us have rel
atives and friends who are janitors or
work at similarly low-paid jobs. Some of
us hold or have belt I these jobs oui selves.
Some of us simply believe that janitors
deserve to be rewarded fairly for theii
hard work, and that Stanford, as a respon
sible institution, should make a commit
ment to a living wage for its workers.

Defending Srinivasan's views
As expected, Balaji Srinivasan's
recent letter to the editor prompted a
stream of self-righteous indignation
from the activists campaigning for high
er janitorial wages, all of which have
made for highly entertaining reading.
Unfortunately, these masters of feel
good rhetoric and catchy slogans (to the
activists: "No pasaran!" is a reallv origi
nal one you can use next time) failed to
address the main point of Mr. Niini
vasan's letter. Money does not grow on
trees. Stanford doesn't have an illegal
printing press stashed in the basement
of Old Union. The extra wages that
these activists are demanding be paid to
the janitors have to come fioni some
where. And in all likelihood, th.it nione\
will come from the students' pockets.
Now, how many of you like to pax
higher tuition? Judging b\ the (lamoi
ever)' time the Hoard of 1 rustees passes
another tuition hike, most of you don't.
In order to avoid this sort ol h)poc i isy,
the activists pressing foi higliei wages
have two choices. Hither they need to
put their wallets where their mouths are
and ask the Board ol 1 rustees lor a
tuition hike that will specificallv go to a
janitors' fund, or they need to seriously
rethink the basis for their protests. It is
very easy to protest when the end result
of the actions that one is requesting will
not adversely impact one's financial sta
tus (or one's monmiie and daddies
financial status), it is an entirely differ

eni matter to tit) so when one is willing
it) back up words with dollar bills.
Finally, lest I be accused ol being a
heartless capitalist pig by the restless
proletariat in White I'la/a, I would like
10 sa\ that I would be absolutely thrilled
11 Ihe janitors were paid salaries on the
st ale of those paid to dot-com computer
programmers. Unfortunately, no one in
this world "deserves" a salar\ just by
one's mere existence, one earns a salary
based on how much the rest ol I lie
world values ones labor. I have no
tlouhl that janitors work hard, and quite
a few of them are intelligent human
beings who simph had no opportunity
it) get an education, but it is a sad fact of
life that unskilled labor simply doesn't
pay much and no amount ol "from
each according to his ability, it) each
actoiding to his need will change that.

Students need to get out and vote
I wo and a halt weeks ago, campus

oped since then. Special lee recipients

will have actually turned but to express

record levels, but what will the figures
be come midnight tonight?
\lanv students may choose not to
\ote in these runoffs lor various reasons
- among them indifference, disen
chantment with campaign politics and/
or ilie belief that theii personal interests
will never be at stake. However, given
that student representation is by lai the
most salient issue driving these elec
tions. how much ol its credibility is ulti
niately lost when people don't vote?
One could argue that poor voter
turnout reflects that students siinph
don't care about their interests being
represented I lowever inaccurate a per
ception this uia) be, il nevertheless fol
lows that il we can't prove to the admin
istration that we want to be listened to, il
won't feel compelled to listen to us.
If we students ti ul\ care about our rep
resentation. we must be committed to
shaping how we wish to be represented.
I he fust <iikl most immediateh important
step toward that end is to cast our ballots
in these i unoll elec lions. I lie choice to do
so will be open to us until midnight, and I
hope that vou will take advantage ol it.

As a Stanford student, 1 must sav that
