Defending Hennessy
The opinions page (April 27) had a
letter entitled "Media out of control."
This certainly applies to the editorial
("Hennessy's recent comments raise
concern") above it. The editor is obvi
ously waiting, or not waiting, for an
opportunity to tweak the nose of
authority. President-elect I lennessy is a
kind, sensitive individual, and it is gross
ly unfair to attack him in this way even
before he assumes office. The good
thing is that the editorial will make
decent people feel sympathetic toward
him.

Srinivasan misses point
In Tuesday's letter, "'Janitors' col
umn misses the point," Balaji Srinivasan
presents a simplistic "that's the way it is"
view of the reasons for low-wage work
and offends the dignity of hard-working
janitors with his disingenous prescrip
tions to help them out of poverty.
Mr. Srinivisan tells us that janitors
are doomed to work for low-wages

because they are easily replaced. In
point of fact, 8,500 janitors in Los Ange
les concluded a three-week strike on
Monday in which they secured a $1.90
raise over three years and a $500
return-to-work bonus. None of them
lost their jobs. Because they belong to a
union, these janitors were able to bar
gain collectively with their employer to
improve their working conditions.
The decision to strike involves per
sonal sacrifices that workers will not
make unless they feel that their
demands are both just and realistic. Our
society recognizes that union represen
tation and the right to strike are funda
mental rights of working people pro
tected by the National Labor Relations
Board. The people of Los Angeles rec
ognized that hard-working janitors
deserve fair compensation, and that
businesses can afford to give it to them.
There was widespread community sup
port for the janitors' campaign in L.A.:
community food banks were set up and
public figures, such as Senator Dianne
Feinstein, Al Gore and L.A.'s Republi
can Mayor Richard Riordan, went on
record to show their support. Kven
some building and business owners
acknowledged that the janitors'

demands were reasonable.
In Silicon Valley, the ease is not much
different. Mr. Srinivasan's suggestion
that activists would need to "fork over
$400 of their personal funds" to raise jan
itors' salaries demonstrates Srinivasan's
misunderstanding of the relations
between client and contractor in the jan
itorial industry. First, it is not clear that
such an increase would make janitorial
companies less competitive. 1 lie janitors'
union negotiates a "master contract" with
many contracting companies at once,
thus allowing unionized contractcrs to
keep their prices in line with one anoth
er. In general, the competitive bidding
process among contractors prevents dra
matic rises in the price of bids. Second, it
is unlikely that janitorial wage increases
would be passed onto students. Stanford
University has an endowment of Over $0
billion, which generates over $250 mil
lion in interest annually. Only a small
portion (17 percent) of Stanford's rev
enue conies from student tuition and
fees, and of that, less than 1 percent goes
to the wages of maintenance staff.
At Johns Johns Hopkins University,
President William Brody has instituted a
"living wage" of $7.75 for all University
employees, and students there have not

seen a tuition hike. Stanford sits at the
top of an employment chain with
respect to its janitors. Stanford can
afford to pay the slight price increases
that may result from paying janitors a
decent wage.
While it is true that people possess
varying degrees and kinds of skills, Mr.
Srinivasan's argument that income
inequality is based on "differences in
people that will not go away" is both
uninformed and disrespectful. First of
all. it is not clear that the janitors' skill
level or productivity determines their
pay. Fifteen years ago, janitors made
today's equivalent ofs 12 an hour. Their
productivity has not gone down since
then. What has changed is that they
have been outsourced, introducing a
middle-man between janitors and the
buildings they clean, and their pay has
gone clown accordingly.
The fact that students receive higher
wages than non-students does not
reflect a difference in skill level. Fven
when working side by side in dining
halls, performing the same jobs, student
hashers earn more than their non-stu
dent counterparts. The subsidized stu
dent wage reflects a commitment on the
part of Stanford to help students 112 inance

their education. Stanford should make a
similar commitment to ensuring that the
people who maintain the university
receive a wage that meets their needs.
Low-skilled jobs are both valuable
and necessary, and workers in these jobs
should be rewarded for their hard work.
Even though, as Mr. Srinivasan has
pointed out, someone will always be on
the bottom of the income ladder, this
bottom need not leave working families
below the poverty line.
It is outrageous to suggest, as Mr.
Srinivasan does, that those who work at
low-wage jobs on this campus are not
capable of making decisions for them
selves. In order to survive on some of the
wages paid, people must be incredibly
shrewd. Supporting the efforts of janitors
on this campus is not "white-upperclass
guilt politics." Those who support the
janitors represent a diverse group of
workers, community members, faculty
and students — not to mention the jani
tors themselves. Let's be clear that the
janitors themselves are the ones who
organized, went on strike in Los Angeles
and won a wage increase and bonus.
Their allies are merely supporters — not
