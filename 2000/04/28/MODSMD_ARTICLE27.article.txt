Ojai.
To us. it means little.
To the Stanford women's tennis team, it
means everything.
Well, not everything, l>nt a lot.

hosts the 100 th Annual ()j<ii Valley I ennis
Tournament, an event which features the
Pacific 10 Conference Individual Champi

onships. Singles pla\ began yesterday, and
the final will be plavcd on Sunday.
Although last year's champion, sopho
more Marissa Irvin, is skipping this year's
tournament due to scheduling conflicts, it's
Mill likely that a Cardinal woman will walk
away with the tropin .

cruised to a first-round win yesterday at the Pac-10 women's individual tennis championships in
Ojai.
I'ac-10 team crown with wins over
I CIA and I SC. last weekend.
"We had some tough matches over
the past few weeks, but we got
through them, and it was good foi
us. I think everyone's looking for
ward to the I'ac-10s and the
NCAAs."
Five Stanford women gained
entry into the 32-playet Ojai sin
gles draw, which includes the lop
competitors from the I'ac-10, the
nation's most competitive confer
ence. No oilier s( liool boasts as
many participants. Moreover, be
cause all five ('ardinal < oinpelitot s

throughout the draw, Stanford's

I-reshman I .aura (>i anville, the
tournament's top seed, should
enjoy a relatively easy path to the

II she gets past California's
Christine I'usano in today's sec

likely face teammate Keiko Toku

the Cardinal singles ladder, again
proved Stanford's unrivaled
depth yesterday with an easy 0-2,

the Bruins.
l okuda, however, must get
past CSC's Jewel I'eterson, the na
tion's Kith-ranked player, to earn
a possible quarterfinal meeting
with (iranville.
Sophomore Cabriela I.astra,
who has had an up-and-doyvn sea
son, is the only Stanford player in
the second quarter of the draw.
Yesterday, I.asira avenged a re

I n i lie second round, l.astra w ill
face Gal's Amy Jensen, ranked
19th in the nation, while 15th
ranked Allison Bradshayv ol Ari
zona Stale links as a possible quar
tet final opponent.
Ashley is a question mark. Al
though hei powerful game, when
on, can overwhelm any collegiate
play er, Ashley s recent results have
been ei ratic. Alter struggling to re
covet from tendonitis in her wrist
throughout the first half oi l lie sea
son, Ashley lias had difficulty find

ing her form.
Nonetheless, she played a confi
dent first-round match, routing
Cal's Karoline Borgerson,6-l-6-3.
In order to gain a quarterfinal
berth, Ashley must get past Ari
zona State's Karin Palme, who beat
her in straight sets two weeks ago,
in the second round.
With a win over Palme, Ashley
could find herself in a quarterfinal
showdown with UCLA's Sara
Walker, the nation's seventh
ranked player and the tourna
ment's fourth seed.
Although sophomore Lauren
Kalvaria has yet to play her first
round match, she is one of the
tournament's top title-con
tenders. Ranked ninth in rlie na
tion. Kalvaria lias enjoyed a
breakout season, posting victo
ries over several highly-ranked
opponents.
Washington's Kristina
Kraszewski, however, the tourna
ment's second seed, looms as a
possible quai lerfinal round oppo
nent. I he hard-hitting Kraszewski
has won her last fixe encounters
with Kalvaria.
Nonetheless, head coach Frank
Brennan remains confident about
Kalvaria's title chances. In tact, he
likes all fixe Cardinal women's
chances.
"If (iranville is healthy, she'll be
hard to stop, and Lauren
[Kalvaria] s a rock," he said. "But
this is anyone's tournament."
