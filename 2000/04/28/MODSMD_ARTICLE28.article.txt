# Card sharpens its spikes for Cal
## 
### TIM KANE STAFF WRITER 
Flash back to February if you will, a
time when basketball optimism was ram
pant, the weather was wet, and the
specter of finals loomed fi ighteningly in
the distance.
With relatively little fanfare, the Stan
ford baseball team swept three games
from California in Berkeley in a non
conference series, emphatically demon
strating the vast difference between the
two teams (and programs).
Now it's April. Basketball is gone, the
sky is blue, and once again No. 4 Stan
ford and Cal will clash on the diamond
— only this time it's down on the Farm,
and the games mean a lot more than
they did last time.
For the Cardinal (32-10, I 1-4 Pacific

10 Conference), the three-game series
beginning Friday represents an oppor
tunity to gain some breathing room in
the tight Pac-10 race, while the Golden
Bears (23-22, 9-9) hope to cling to their
slim NCAA, tournament hopes while ex
acting revenge for the February sweep.
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess
isn't about to understate the importance
of this series, not with Arizona State tied at
the top with the Cardinal and only nine
conference games left in the season. ASU
takes on USC in Los Angeles in a three
game set of their own this weekend.
"Every time is crunch time," Mar
quess said. Cal "is very dangerous,
they're physical with the bat, and they've
played very well the second half of the
year. I hey can hurt you, they've got
some great players, and they pitched
better than thev thought they would.

It'll be a good series."
For junior right fielder Joe Borchard,
one thing is certain: It will be an ex
hausting series. Borchard, who is also a
quarterback on the football team, has
been taking part in spring football prac
tices in addition to his baseball duties
and will play in the Cardinal and White
scrimmage Saturday at 12:15 p.m. be
fore heading over to Sunken Diamond
fora 2 p.m. baseball start.
Since Borchard began football prac
tice on April 10, he has been on a tear,
hitting .353 (12-for-34) with three
homers and eight runs batted in the
eight-game stretch.
I'he only person hotter than Bor
chard might be senior third baseman
John Gall, who enters the Cal series tied
