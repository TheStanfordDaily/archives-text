# 'Building year' pleases volleyball

### MEGHAN O'CONNOR STAFF WRITER 
March has been described as coming
in like a lion and going out like a lamb.
When looking back ai the Stanford
men s volleyball season it seems thai jusi
the opposite applies.
While the squad may have quietly
crept into this year's season, starling oil
with a discouraging 2-f> record, ii pro
gressively grew in strength and I he men
went out as a threat to the nation's top
ranked teams.
"The thing we did best was improve
from October to ihe end of April. Our
improvement was steady and consis
tent.," said head coach Ruben Nieves.
" I be way we rebounded 112 rom a 2-0 start,
stuck together and got the season turned
around was a real accomplishment and
credit to the players."
Picked at No. 14 in the preseason poll,
Stanford was not expec ted to give teams
like No. 1 LCLAand No. 2 Long Beach
State much trouble. I hough the Cardi
nal clinched the national title in 1997, the
squad losi in the quarterfinals of the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
playoffs the following year and then
failed to qualify for post-season play in
1999. This season was pegged as a re
building year.
I he team boasted just one senior to

IcÂ»;kI a squad packed with seven fresh
men. And despite having to deal with an
inexperienced lineup, the Cardinal was
faced with preseason injuries that would
knock out returning setter junior Brad
Criffith for the whole season and senior
captain josh Palacios for the first half.
Left with just one setter, junior Josh
I.ukens, and only three other players
with collegiate experience, the Cardinal
took on the task of building a new team
in the country's toughest men's volley
hall conference, which contained 10 of
the top 15 teams in the preseason poll.
The team's growth was evident in its
ability to compete with top teams by the
end of the season despite losses early on
where Stanford struggled to secure
points. For instance, competition with
Long Beach State, a team ranked in the
top two all season, ( hanged from a quick,
lopsided three-game loss in January into
a five-game Stanford victory in April.
1 hough its most impressive win, Stan
lord's victory against Long Beach was
not the only match where the squad
warned that it wasn't a team to be under
estimated. A tight four-game loss to I hen-
No. Pepperdine was followed by a
string of three upset victories, as the tin
ranked Cardinal took out No. 9 Loyola
Marymount in three games and No. 15
UC-Irvine and No. 12 Pacific both in
lour.

"We had a really young team," Josh
Palacios said, "and for us to compete at
the level we did, 1 think we'll only get bet
ter next year with a year of experience
and basically the same team in tact."
I lie playoffs gave Stanford its final
chance to upset a top-ranked team as the
squad traveled south to face No. 2 Pep
perdine in the MPSF quarterfinals.
"Our performance in playoffs was an
other highlight," Nieves said. "Even
though it was a short playoffs for us, I
think we performed and competed very
will in the most important match of the
season. Perhaps going 15-13 in the fifth
game with the No. 2 team might be an
eye-opener for the players and give them
reason to understand why we can com
pete with the very best teams right now."
Though the Cardinal could not se
cure a win in its impressive comeback,
the three- hour, five-game match left
Stanford with a strong exit from the play
offs and fans with a reminder that the
Cardinal could play with the best of
them.
"We took big steps this year in our win
over Long Beach and even losing against
Pepperdine," |osh Palacios said. "I hope
it set a tone for those guys to play with
that kind of dedication."
As for next year, the team is opti-
