Kmeritus Aeronautics and As
tronautics Prof. Richard Shevell,
known for his love of planes and
clarity in teaching, died last Friday
at 79 after fighting lymphoma
cancer for eighteen years.
"He reveled in technological
accuracy and engineering design,
but his success was the way he
worked well with people . ... He
always had a sense of humor about
everything," said his son Steven.
Shevell specialized in aerody
namics in his 28-year career at
Douglas Aircraft, which later be
came the McDonnell Douglas
Corporation and then merged
with The Boeing Company. Dur
ing World War 11 he designed the
aerodynamic features of the first
Nike Ajax missile and worked on
drag determination for combat
and supply planes.
In 1959 Shevell became chief of
the aerodynamic section at Dou
glas Aircraft, and in 1907 he was
named director of the commercial
advanced design department,
which was responsible for design
ing the well-known DC 1 .-10, a wide
bodied aircraft intended to carry
over 300 passengers from coast to
coast. Before McDonnell Douglas
discontinued the design in 1989, it
had built 440 for both govern
ment and commercial purposes.

When the
DC-10 took its
maiden flight, in
the siunmer of
1970, Shevell
was preparing to
join the Stanford
faculty. He
taught introduc
tory courses in

aeronautics and astronautics, air
craft design and an ethics course on
the proper role of an engineer in
modern society.
"One of the wonderful things
about Professor Shevell was that
he had both tec hnical depth and
great common sense," said Ilan
Kroo, a professor of aeronautics
and astronautics.
In 1983 Shevell published
"Fundamentals of Flight." Kroo
called it "one of the best introduc
tory college-level books on aero
nautics."
I he research Shevell conduct
ed while at Stanford resulted in
the invention of small devices
c alled vortilons, which improved a
plane's performance by directing
the flow of air over its wings. He
also consulted on research pro
jects with NASA, the Department
of 1 ransportation and NATO.
Shevell is survived by his wife
Lorraine King Shevell, his chil
dren Steven, Jeanne and Diane
and his granddaughters Lee and
Lauren.
