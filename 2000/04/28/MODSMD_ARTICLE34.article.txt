The No. 12 Stanford soltball team (38-12,4-8 Pacif
ic 10 (lonference) is riding a wave of wins lately. With a
split against No. 5 Fresno State last Wednesday, a win
against No. 8 California and a sweep of Sacramento
State, the (Cardinal lias reversed its midseason slump of
two weeks ago.
Stanford hopes to ride the momentum ol the past
week and a half as it heads fora weekend on the road,
traveling south to face No. 3 I CIA (33-7, 8-3) today
and heading up to Seattle lor games against top
ranked Washington (47-5, 9-2) on Saturday and Sun
day.
"We've got a good roll going," said freshman pile It
er Dana Sorenson. " I hese games are critical as we are
starting to near crime h time. It would he great to heat
both ol these teams belbre N( A \ regionals."
I he (lardinal hopes to overcome its earlier season
perfbrmanc e against the Bi u ins and the 11 uskies. Both
U(lLXand Washington traveled to the Farm March 31
through April 2, holding Stanford scoreless between
them. Fhe Huskies notched a (>-0 win, and I CLA
knocked oil the (lardinal I -0 and 8-0.
I low ever past woes d< > not worry the (lardinal. Pow
ered behind super-battei sophomore Jessica Mendoza
and Sorenson, who both notched l'ac-10 honors this
week, the s<|uad is reach to take on two of the nation's
top teams.
"These games are realk something to be excited
about," S<)renson said. "Selcl<>iii do vou gel the <>pp<>r-
tunity to knock of the No. I and the No. 3 teams in a
single weekend."
Fhe freshman pile lied her wax to two lop-10 victo-

ries last week, including a shutout against Cal. Soren
son lowered her FRA to 1.11 and is on pace to break the
Stanford single-season FRA record of 1.24.
But good pitching isn't the only element ol the Car
dinal roster that has been making some recent head
lines. Mendoza broke the school's all-time home-run
record against (lal last week on a game-winning shot in
the ninth.
Mendoza wasn't the only Cardinal player to make
the highlight reel. Sophomore Sarah Beeson hit two
homers and a double in the second game of the dou
ble header against Sacramento State, picking up 7
KB Is.
" Fhe bottom half of the lineup is really coining up
strong," said Sorenson. "We have also really eliminat
ed the defensive errors that seemed to be plaguing us.'
But while the Cardinal has many weapons, UCLA
and Washington clearly have a few of their own.
I'itching tin the Bruins is NFC 1A National player of
the week Amanda Freed.
Julie Marshall and Julie Adams are some of UCI As
biggest threats at the plate. Both of them are vying for
several career bitting rec<>r<ls.
fhe Huskies are led by pitchers Jamie (-raves and
Jennifer Spediacci who post FRAs 0f0.53, and 0.59 re
spectively, good for fourth and sixth in the nation.
The pitchers play even better at home. Washington
has not allowed a run on its home diamond in 58 of the
last 01 innings it has played.
Jenny lopping is the big bitter lor the Huskies,
leading the nation in home runs per game with .40.
1 hese three games are c ritical to get the struggling
Cardinal back in the Pac-10 standings. While Wash
ington and UCLA battle lor the Conference crown,
Stanford sits a dismal sixth.
