# Lacrosse eyes finals
## 
### BROOKE MORRILL 
This weekend, the women's
lacrosse team (1 1-10) heads to UC-
Davis for the North Division 1
playoffs, where it faces its final op
portunity to reach the WWLL
Final Four.
UC-Davis, St. Mary's, Cal and
Stanford will all be present at the
playoffs and will battle to be
among the top two teams to go to
San Diego next weekend for the
( hainpionship.
The Cardinal (ranked third)
will oppose Cal (ranked second)
once again, in attempt to avenge
last weekend's 8-7 loss in overtime.
"Even after a tough overtime
loss to Cal, this team is ready,"
head coach Heidi Connor said.
"No matter what happened earlier
in the season, this game on Satur
day is a fresh start for us. The his
tory shouldn't matter during this
game, it is a chance to start anew
and play great lacrosse."
Senior co-captain Christina Ci
lyutin spoke optimistically and
confidently about the coming
match.
"Despite the final results of last
weekend, we know that we out
played them," she said. "We dom
inated the ball offensively and
were simply outscored."
In order to prepare for the
playoff game, throughout this
week's practice Connor has
stressed double-teaming the op

position, planned plays for offen
sive possessions and 8-meter
penalty shots.
Cilyutin also stressed the im
portance of forming a team goal
with all eyes on winning the cham
pionship for the third time in a
row.
"We feel like we are going into
this game with a clean slate. I have
seen a lot of positive energy on and
off the field and I think everyone's
enthusiasm and optimism will re
ally show on Saturday."
The competition among the
four Northern teams has intensi
fied dramatically in the past two
weeks. The previously undefeated
Davis team (ranked first) lost to Cal
10-6, and Wednesday, Cal barely
beat St. Mary's College 9-8 by a
clutch goal with five seconds re
maining in the game.
"What this tells me is that any
team can win or lose on any given
day," Connor said. "We are ready
and prepared to win."
I his year's playoffs are a reflec
tion of the increased intensity that
West Coast lacrosse has taken in
the past couple of years. With
more challenging teams being
scheduled, the skill level of the
WWLL teams has improved.
"During the past two years, we
made it to the Final Four fairly eas
ily. The fact that Stanford has
struggled more this season really
shows how much California
lacrosse has grown." Cilyutin said.
