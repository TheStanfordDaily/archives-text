# Faculty diversity improves

### PATRICK C. CROSETTO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Over tlic past five vears, the
number of facnlt\ grew by 14 per
cent, Provost John Henness\ told
members of the Faculty Senate
yesterday. The minority propor
tion of the professoriate, targeted
for an increase, also rose.
Fhe increase in lacultx size was
largeh spurred l)\ growth in the
Medical Clinician Fine. I lie c lini
cian stall has grown In f>o percent
over the past live vears, while most
other sectors of the I niveisit\ saw
llat or relativel) small faculty
growth.
Hennessy said the fat nll \
changes reflected no majoi
trends.
"1 spent a lot of time looking
through spreadsheets, and 1 could
not find any discernible pattern."
he said.
The numbers looked promis
ing for faculty who are members
of the four targeted minorities:
Asian Americans, African Ameri
cans, 1 lispanics and Native Atner
uans.
"Most of the schools show a
growth, |except | lor Fai th Sci
ences." said I lennessy. "[Hut] this
is because of small numbers. One
facult) member leaves and this
makes a huge statistical differ
ence.
Questioned about whether
Asians should be counted as mi
norities, I lennessy insisted that
Iliev are tracked as targeted mi
norities b\ the federal govern
ment. I le said, "The figures would
look different if you removed the
Asians. 1 didn't look at it, but it
would look diflerent.
" l lie rate of progress lias been

driven farthest by Asian Ameri
cans, and next by I lispanics," I len
nessy said. "There are differences
by school, though, hducation has
shown growth in all minorities.
1111 ] oilier schools yon find small
growth in African Americans, for
example."
Vice Provost for Faculty Devel
opment Patricia Jones gave a sepa
rate report on the status of women
faculty, as mandated by the Facul
ty Senate in 1998.
She reported that over the last
ten years, the percentage of
women in the professoriate has
risen from 11.7 percent to 19.9
percent. ()ver the past year, there
was a net increase of 23 female fac -
ulty members.
" l lie representation of women
is lowest in the schools of science
.ind engineering due to low avail

ability of women in those pools of
applicants," Jones said. "I lowever,
there is a higher representation of
women in life sciences as com
pared to physical sciences."
Jones saw hope for the growth
of female faculty representation, as
the turnover of faculty helps to add
more women. Twenty-eight per
cent of new hires are women.
"We can dissect this data and
find little things that need to lie
made better, . . . but I think it's im
portant to recognize good news
when we have it. In terms of a half
full glass, I think this is actually
two-thirds full," said Biology Prof.
Robert Simoni.
loiter in the meeting, Earth Sci
ences Dean Franklin Orr, the head
of a special committee on faculty
housing, presented a report.
Orr showed charts and graphs

which demonstrated the difficulty
of finding faculty housing at Stan
ford as compared to other univer
sities.
"We should encourage faculty
to live close to the campus," he
said. "Stanford has one great thing
about it — at least one — that
Stanford is a campus community
of scholars."
In order to maintain this com
munity and major part of the Stan
ford's original vision, Orr recom
mended financial assistance for fac
ulty members to obtain housing.
His proposals included a re
quest for the construction of more
on-campus faculty units and new
solutions such as helping older
emeritus professors move to off
campus housing and giving rental
assistance to non-tenured profes
sors.
