COMMOTIONS
In a text box appearing alongside a Friday, April 28 article about complaints
filed to the Constitutional Council, the text inaccurately stated that ASSU bylaws
require that electrons be held more than one week after validation of the electron.
The text should have said, "The ASSU presidential runoff election currently in
progress may be unconstitutional, since ASSU bylaws state elections must be
held after certification of the election.* An updated version of the bylaws states
that the process of certification has replaced validation.
