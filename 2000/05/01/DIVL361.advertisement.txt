As you're no doubt well
aware, stress is a part of
university life: exams, compe
tition, relationships, finances,
and difficult decisions can liter
ally make you sick. Researchers
now have hard data confirming
the negative influence of stress
on the body. Yet many people
still don't notice the connection
between unrelenting tension
and feeling achy or sick.
Stress/Relax Response
We have two built-in mecha
nisms to protect our health: the
stress response and its anti
dote, the relaxation response.
Our stress response kicks in
automatically when we feel
threatened. The heart speeds
up, breathing becomes faster
and more shallow, blood pres
sure rises, and we're ready for
"fight or flight."
This survival mechanism is
great for short-term emergen
cies, like being chased by a
bear. But it's harmful when
triggered and sustained by
anticipated fears. It leads to
physiological changes that
affect your immune system,
sleep, and digestion, and can
lead to serious problems.
But when the relaxation response
is invoked, heart rate slows,
muscles relax, and breathing
deepens and slows. Relaxation
reduces anxiety, fear, muscle
tension, pain, healing time, and
sleep problems. It strengthens
the immune system, and enables
you to renew yourself in the
midst of continuous change.

Relax and have some fun
while you're at Stanford - it's
a long-standing tradition.
Learning to Relax
Many of us who manage our
outside lives skillfully are often
clueless when it comes to
knowing what our own bodies
need. We have to learn how to
relax. Here are some tips:
■ Observe how your mind
and body respond to events
(notice when you tense up;
when you relax)
■ Make tension-release a habit:
stretch your neck (chin to
chest, chin to each shoulder,
ear to each shoulder), gaze
at the sky, stretch muscles,
and take deep breaths
anytime, anywhere
■ When under stress, repeat
to yourself: "calm body,
clear mind"
■ Take up an activity to balance
your academic life: try
ceramics, a martial art,
wrestling, quilting, calli
graphy, singing, taiko
■ Take a hot bath or get a
massage
■ Plan something fun
■ Watch a TV comedy or
funny video
■ Get absorbed in a game
■ Have lunch with a friend or
go to the movies
■ While driving, play soothing
music
■ Alternate activities: do
vigorous exercise after concen
trated study; do laundry after
challenging classes
Relaxation Techniques
Physical Exercise: Whether it's
a 65 mile bike ride or a quick
walk around the building,
exercise is a proven method of
tension release.
Muscle Relaxation: Tense each
group of muscles for 10 sec
onds, then suddenly release
them. Notice the difference.
Meditation: You stop everything
to quietly reach a "still point."
Here the mind is calm and
clearly aware, stress is let go,
and both mind and body relax.
Yoga: This discipline involves
breathing and holding certain
positions.
Affirmations: Repetition of
positive expressions such as "I
will do well."
Self-hypnosis: You relax and
focus your own mind on a rele
vant topic.
Imagery: Concentration on an
image.
Visualization: You "see" yourself
relaxed, successful, happy,
(whatever).
