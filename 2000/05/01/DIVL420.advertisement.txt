for the work. Whettzcippening was
able to obtain a preview copy. Not
only can your dirty laundry become
lovely (albeit fragrant) wildlife art,
your empty pizza boxes can make a
handy end table. I.isa has ideas for
empty beverage cans as wind chimes,
empty toilet tissue rolls as pencil pots
and (our personal favorite) making
window shades out of uncooked
spaghetti.
Lisa says she's not discouraged by
the lack of interest from publishers.
After all, she says "Where there is
demand, there is a market.The masses
will soon be clamoring for this work."
"That's why my day job at the
Credit Union is so satisfying, too. Our
members love the convenience of
SFCU's electronic services. I am the
person behind the machine, but not
like that Wizard of Oz,guy. I'm the real
deal.When members have questions
about our electronic services, they
can call and talk to me, or send me an
e-mail. I work very hard to solve any
problems and answer any questions
promptly and thoroughly."
Lisa can be reached by phone at
(650) 723-8906 or by e-mail at
lisa@sfcu.org.
It 's clear that Lisa loves "her"
members.And members love Lisa, too.
To date, Lisa has received flowers,
candy, and has had a creek named
after her.

Mouse Morphs into
Credit Card!
New technology is about to create a sensation among members of Stanford
Federal Credit Union. Sources revealed that after June 15, 2000, a product called
LoanClick will mean online loan approval in about two minutes! By simply
logging onto the Stanford Federal Credit Union's Web site (www.sfcu.org) and
clicking LoanClick, your mouse can morph into a car loan, personal loan or
credit card. •
An online loan application and submission directly to the loan processing
facility make this kind of revolutionary speed and convenience possible. Devel
opers, however, felt that having a literal morphing of the mouse (wherein the
mouse would be replaced by a new car or credit card) was impractical."The
cord attaching the vehicle or credit card to the computer would make driving
or spending quite prohibitive." says one engineer.
Instead, a printable "Certificate of Approval" will appear on your screen.
E-mails will be sent to you and to SFCU's loan department confirming your
approval.
When you need credit after June 15th. point your mouse at LoanClick and
enjoy speed and convenience like never before.
