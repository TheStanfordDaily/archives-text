1946
Student complaints about t&e inadequa
cy of meeting space and the lade of restau
rants on campus surfaced long before re
cent debates over Tresidder. Just after
World War 11, the Daily editorial board
wrote: "Part of the blame for this tendency
to disassociate our activities from the cam
pus lies in the physical plant of the campus
itself. There is still no place where Stanford
students can drop in fora coke or a ham
burger any time of the day; no place where
they can turn on a jukebox and dance; no
place where they can sit around to relax as
long as they please.
The Cellar is overburdened and inade
quate; the Nitery fizzled out for lack of care;
due primarily to its uninviting, cavernous
size; the golf course is too far from the Quad;
and the Boathouse is and should be de
signed only for spring swimming.
With the large number of new students
now at school here, it is necessary more than
ever that there should be someplace de
signed for students alone that can be a cen
ter of campus activities, an informal but ac
tual symbol of the Farm itself. What we need
is a student union. But we don't get one til
we work for it. And the demand must come
fron you."
The Bottom Line: Is a renovated Polio's the best
we can do?
