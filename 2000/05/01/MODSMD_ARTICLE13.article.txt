Struggling to finish an assignment at
Columbia University in the (all of 1998, Puneet
Bhandari would have loved some extra time.
Sadly, his wish was granted after his car was
hit by a drunk driver. Although he escaped
without a scratch, his twin brother, Parag, re
mained in the hospital in critical condition.
Puneet told his professor that he needed to
stay dose to his family. Later, when Parag died
after being taken off life support, Puneet need
ed even more time off. A terrible turn of events
— or so it seemed. But this semester, a Colum
bia official discovered that Mr. Bhandari had
made the whole thing up.
They promptly suspended him for two years,
and last month, a federal judge turned down
Mr. Bhandari's request for an injunction forcing
Columbia to let him finish his last semester.
Mr. Bhandari's story had unraveled after he
asked the professor to write him a recommen
dation for medical school. Hie letter praised Mr.
Bhandari's resilience in the face of his brother's
death, but the student didn't know that.
So when a medical-school interviewer asked
a general question about his brother, Mr. Bhan
dari answered that Parag was doing quite well
as an investment banker.
