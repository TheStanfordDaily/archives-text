## Hundreds of thousands march for gay rights in capital 
### 
WASHING I ON (AP) — Hundreds of thousands
of gays and supporters inarched yesterday on the
Capitol, transforming the National Mall into a sea of
multicolored flags and joining hands in a show of
unity they hope will transform recent victories into
wider protections for homosexuals.
"We're only asking for the same rights as anyone
else," Adam May of Atlanta declared as he walked
with the throngs of marchers. "Depriving one per
son .... puts everyone at risk of losing."
In a crowd dotted with openly gay celebrities, the
marchers celebrated a week of victories that included
passage of a new law in Vermont giving gays mar
riage-like rights and a renewed plea by President
Clinton fora federal Hate Crimes Prevention Act.
But participants vowed not to rest until same-sex
couples get equal rights in all 50 states, and some wore
costumes or carried signs calling attention to fights
still on the horizon.
One man wearing a Boy Scout uniform and held
up a "Straight Scouts for gay scouts," calling attention
to a case heard by the Supreme Court last week in
which a Scout leader was fired because he was gay.
Others carried signs saying "Stop Hate Crimes" and
chanted "full rights for gays."
Clinton spoke via videotape to what was the first
gay rights march on Washington since 1993. His
image shown on a giant screen, the president de
clared he had presided over "the most inclusive ad
ministration in history" that has appointed more than
150 openly gay people to important government
posts.
Also in the crowd was the father of Matthew Shep
ard, the 21-year-old gay University of Wyoming stu
dent who died in October 1998 after being beaten into
a coma and tied to a fence.
Dennis Shepard said he met with Clinton on Fri
day and was optimistic the hate crimes bill would pass.
"If my son was alive, he would be here today,"
Shepard said. "Gay rights is the civil rights issue of this
century."
Small Business Administration head Aida Alvarez

praised Clinton and Vice President A1 Gore as "true
believers" in making government represent all
groups.
Law enforcement officials said there was no sign of
any anti-gay rights demonstrators, and agreed with es
timates the crowd numbered at least 200,000 in size.
March co-chair Donna Red Wing gave a much higher
estimate, saying it may have been as large as 1 million.
March organizers spoke of trying to mobilize gay
and lesbian supporters into an important voting bloc
for November's presidential election, and some dis
missed Republican George W. Bush's recent overture
to the gay community.
"I think there would be a lot of anger if Bush got
elected because a lot of conservative values would
come back into play," said Debbie Fitzpatrick, who
traveled from New Jersey for the march. "The Clinton
administration has done more for gays than anyone in
the past."
One demonstrator sported a "Gore 2000" button
and wore a T-shirt urging Bush's defeat.
Not all pro-gay activists were happy about the
march.
William K. Dobbsof New York, a member of the Ad
Hoc Committee for an Open Process, complained that
many felt left out of the march planning because local
grassroots organizing committees weren't used like in
past years. His group urged a boycott of the event.
"This march has opened up a rift over who speaks
for the movement and how decisions are made,"
Dobbs said. "The way it's been done is to use a lot of
Hollywood celebrities and newspaper advertising, no
local organizing committees. There's no platform,. . .
and much of the decisions were made behind closed
doors."
Julian Potter, the White House liaison to the gay
and lesbian community, tried to smooth over differ
ences. "We don't always agree" on which path to take,
but "what I do know is that every step we take" leads
closer to equal rights for all, Potter said.
Actress Ellen DeGeneres addressed the gathering.
"As a celebrity the most important tiling 1 will ever do

is stand up" and speak out for gay lights, she said. "I
feel very proud for being gay. When you are gay and
when you are fighting for something, your life takes on
so much more meaning."
To loud applause, DeGeneres partner, actress
Anne Heche, said "it would be really wonderful if in
the next reunion" in Washington "we had as many
straight people here as gays."

Participants had mixed feelings about the latest po
litical development on the AIDS front, a declaration by
the National Security Council that the disease is a
threat to U.S. national security.
The NSC concluded that the global spread of the
disease could undermine free-market dermxxacies,
trigger ethnic warfare and possibly overturn foreign
governments.
