CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — The Citadel's
top-ranking female cadet, one of the first
women to attend the school, has been demoted
over her reaction to being targeted by a mess
hall prank.
Petra Lovetinska went from cadet major and
battalion executive officer to senior private and
received 20 demerits. She also was ordered to
do 40 marching tours in the barracks. Each
tour is 50 minutes, at a pace of 120 steps per
minute, while carrying a rifle.
Lovetinska, who graduates May 13, was tar
geted by the prank called "wiping out the
shoes," said the Citadel spokeswoman Heather
Anderson.
The prank — part of the 154-year-old mili
tary school's tradition — goes like this: An up
perclassman tells a freshman cadet, called a

knob, to crawl under the table and pour condi
ments such as ketchup or salad dressing on an
upperfclassman's shoes without getting caught.
Success wins the knob the admiration of class
mates, commanding officers and other upper
classmen. Failure typically results in a pitcher of
tea being poured on the knob.
What got Lovetinska in trouble is the way she
reacted, Anderson said. She grabbed the knob, a
male cadet, and wiped her shoes on his trousers.
The commandant of cadets, Brig. Gen.
Emory Mace, issued the punishment this past
Thursday.
Lovetinska, one of the first four women to at
tend The Citadel in 1996 after the school
dropped its all-male admissions policy, has done
well at the school. Lovetinska has consistently
made the dean's list. She was the first female

cadet major. And in March, Lovetinska received
1 lie Citadel's highest honor, the Palmetto
Medal.
But Lovetinska was punished as any other
cadet charged with gross poor judgment, An
derson said.
Disciplinary matters generally are kept secret.
But Lovetinska gave school officials permission
to discuss the situation with The (Charleston)
Post and Courier..
Lovetinska cannot regain her rank, but
Citadel policy will allow her to wear her cadet
major stripes — the highest rank she attained —
on her uniform during graduation.
The knob who put what was thought to be
French salad dressing on Lovetinska's shoes
April 20 and the upperclassman who asked him
to do it were not disciplined.
