# Vietnam celebrates war's 25th anniversary
## 
### 
HO CHI MINH CITY, Viet
nam (AP) — Vietnam celebrated
its stunning victory over the
world's No. 1 superpower 25 years
ago with a remarkably unwarlike
parade yesterday and hopes it can
battle its way out of poverty in the
new millennium.
Aging architects of that victory
over the United States and its
South Vietnamese allies saluted as
thousands of soldiers, students,
women in flowing ao dais — the
traditional tunic and trousers —
and barefooted mountain tribes
people filed past on the grounds of
the Reunification Palace.
The day belonged to a man who
died three decades ago, indepen
dence hero Ho Chi Minh, whose
three-story portrait hung from the
palace facade. But the mood was
more akin to a springtime festival
than a remembrance of war.
The heaviest weapons to be seen
were assault rifles, and most units
marched without them. Patriotic
songs like "Uncle Ho Lives in the
Great Victory Day," alternated with
lilting, dance-like numbers during
the 1 1/2-hour parade.
"Vietnam looks back to the fu
ture," a headline in the official En
glish-language Vietnam News
said.
Also marking the anniversary
were the release of more than
12,000 prisoners, including con
victed murderers, in the country's

biggest-ever amnesty and a mass
wedding of 25 couples at a down
town park.
In the day's only speech, HoChi
Minh City mayor Vo Viet Thanh
focused on economic problems in
Vietnam, among the world's poor
est nations with an average yearly
per capita income of $370.
A higher economic growth rate,
elimination of corruption and less
restrictive policies, Thanh said,
were among the city's goals in the
21st century. He stressed that
"every favorable condition" would
be afforded foreign investors.
With some 20,000 people gath
ered on the palace grounds,
Thanh recalled the war that ended
April 30,1975, when tanks 390 and
843 smashed through the gates of
what was then known as Indepen
dence Palace and communist sol
diers hoisted their flag atop the
building.
The fall of the city, then called
Saigon, was the last act of a tragic
drama which saw two halves of the
country, South and North Viet
nam, locked in fratricidal combat
and the unleashing of American
war technology on a rural s<xiety.
"For what Vietnam and Ho Chi
Minh City can enjoy today, the en
tire nation has paid 30 years of con
tinuous fighting, the loss of millions
of human lives and the loss of the
most beloved members of millions
of families," he said.
