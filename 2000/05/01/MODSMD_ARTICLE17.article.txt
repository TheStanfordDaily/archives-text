ZAM BOANGA, Philippines
(AP) â€” Philippine forces
sprayed tear gas yesterday into a
tunnel complex where extrem
ists were believed to have hid
den at least some of the 27
hostages they have held for six
weeks, officials said.
Soldiers reported hearing a
child's voice and were cautiously
searching the extensive tunnel
system, believed to have been
built by Japanese soldiers dur
ing World War 11, spokesman
Col. Hilario Atendido said.
Inside (he tunnel, troops
found children's sandals, genera
tors, weapons and 100 sacks of
rice, but the rebels earlier seen
fleeing into the tunnel apparently
escaped through a side exit, mili
tary officials said.
The hostage situation on Basi
lan island is one of two ongoing in
the southern Philippines. Both
are blamed on the Abu Sayyaf, a
loosely organized extremist
group accused of numerous ran
som kidnappings and other at
tacks in southern Mindanao, one
of the Philippines' poorest re
gions. They are believed to have
several hundred armed men.
rhe Abu Sayyaf is the smaller
of two groups lighting for an in
dependent Islamic nation in the
south. The other group, the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front,
said that it has indefinitely sus
pended peace talks because of re
cent military assaults on its camps.
The search of the tunnels
came less than two days after
some 1,500 troops overran the
densely forested Abu Sayyaf rebel
camp on the slopes of Mount
Ponoh Mahajid in an attempt to
rescue the hostages, mostly chil
dren seized from two schools on
March 20.
On Saturday, the rebels
claimed they escaped into the
jungle with all their captives.
"They are all here with us . ..
all 27 of them," rebel spokesman
Abu Ahmad told local radio sta
tion DXRZ.

In the camp, soldiers found
shallow graves believed to con
tain the bodies of about 20
rebels, and suspected that other
bodies were hidden in foxholes
and tunnels.
The hostages were among
about 50 seized by the rebels for
use as human shields after an at
tack on a military outpost. The
rebels later released some of the
hostages, and claimed two weeks
ago to have beheaded two teach
ers after the government reject
ed some of their demands.
The rebels have demanded
the release of three terrorists
from U.S. jails, including Ramzi
Yousef, mastermind of the 1993
bombing of New York's World
Trade Center.
Meanwhile, a government
negotiator said the demands of
separate Abu Sayyaf rebels who
abducted 21 other hostages, in
cluding 10 foreign tourists, from
a Malaysian resort last Sunday
were "still very obscure, nebu
lous."
A partial list of demands de
livered on Saturday were incom
plete and unacceptable, said for
mer rebel leader Nur Misuari.
"They must not demand
something impossible," Misuari
said.
A free-lance journalist who
visited the 21 hostages on Satur
day said they are weak, hungry
and crowded into a small bam
boo hut with no toilet.
Several have diarrhea be
cause of bad drinking water,
Aiiyn de la Cruz said.
The hostages include tourists
from Germany, France, South
Africa, Finland and Lebanon,
and resort workers from the
Philippines and Malaysia.
They were being held in a
mountainous area of Talipao on
Jolo, a Philippine island about 50
miles southwest of Basilan, said
de la Cruz, who has close ties to
the rebels. Jolo is a part of the
Sulu archipelago in the province
of the same name.
