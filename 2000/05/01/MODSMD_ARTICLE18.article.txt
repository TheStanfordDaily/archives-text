ASSU election campaigns are general
ly notorious for one of two things:
either no promises — in the form ol
the popularity contests known as the
ASSU senate races, or a lot of vague promises
— the ASSU presidential election. Over the
years, presidential slates have been spotty at
best in living up to the lofty, iI somewhat ill
defined, goals tliey set before the ballot was
cast. However, perhaps this year may be dif
ferent as the incoming president and vice
president, Set.li Newton and Malia Villegas,
created and based their campaign on the Plat
form for Accountability and Change (PAC). If,
as the name indicates, the new administration
is to become one that truly promotes account
ability and change, then Newton and Villegas
must start immediately to institute fundamen-

tal reforms to the way student government
operates at this University.
Newton and Villegas profess certain guid
ing principles upon which their administration
will be based. Broadly stated, these are to
increase the power of students in decision
making at Stanford on an institutional level, to
address issues of University responsibility that
are systematically ignored, to actively promote
diversity of all kinds and provide a voice
against discrimination while emphasizing the
need for increased accountability, transparen
cy and dialogue between the administration,
ASSU and students. Therefore, this is the stan
dard by which the actions (or inaction) of New
ton and Villegas must be judged next year.
In addition, the two have targeted several
objectives for the upcoming year. They are as

follows:
To secure two student positions on the
Board of Trustees. This is a laudable goal that
could considerably enhance student involve
ment in the overall decision making process at
this university. However, if they succeed, New
ton and Villegas must take care to ensure that
the students on the board will have the oppor
tunity to provide meaningful input and have a
hand in decision making.
To lay the groundwork fora new student
union. Several ASSU senators and presidential
candidates have promised an improved stu
dent union in the past, but very little has hap
pened. This idea needs to go beyond the plan
ning phase and enter actual implementation
on a timely basis.
To improve Stanford's commitment to

diversity by addressing issues such as tenure
policies and community center funding. An
issue of much contention in recent years, New
ton and Villegas must ensure that the concerns
of students on this issue are truly understood
by the administration.
To form a cabinet of six to 12 students from
different student groups to keep them in
touch with the student body. This will come as
a marked improvement to the office, as the
ASSU president has generally come under
criticism for not being responsive to the real
needs of students.
The ASSU president- and vice president
elect must now start to deliver on their cam
paign promises. The student body in turn
should ensure that they do indeed live up to
their commitments.
