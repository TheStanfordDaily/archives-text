# WHAT THE HECK I'M TALKING ABOUT

Bui lor the most part, spring quarter
does not signal the peak of my sleep
debt, ni\ calleiue intake or my typing
speed. No, in these three months of
the year I reai h die peak of what I call
productive procrastination. By (his
lime each year. I have whittled these
skills to a finch tuned, elegantly exe
cuted, royal expenditure of my time.
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is
what I would like to share with you
today.
Now, I'm sure I>\ now you have all
come up with your own strategies for
procrastination, lo each, his or her
own. However, I'd like to cover a few
fun, worthwhile, time-blasting activi
ties, starting with an old Stanford
favorite and a couple newer tech
niques for you to try at home.
Eat. II you live in a house, go to
your open kitchen and whip up a
snack. II you live in a dorm, raid your
fridge or your neighbor's. Better yet,
take a trip to Jamba Juice and use up
twice the time. Schedule hungriness
for the middle of a long project. Now,
brace yourselves — I just had a sand
wich between those last two sentences.
No kidding, I really did. It's as easy as
that. It works the same when you're
writing a paper, or a lab report.
Although you do have to be careful of
spillage — coffee on .1 keyboard is no
good. Ketchup on that rough draft
doesn't get you too far.
Look fora summer job when you
should be working. Surf the Web for
viable dot-coms and corporate Web
sites in your region, lest all the links
on the site lo make sure they work.

Sample the product. Read the reviews.
Compile color-coded files on each pos
sible employer. Write individualized
cover letters. Learn 20 different ways
to attach your resume on Pine.
I his procrastination technique pro
vides double benefits: avoid your
duties while seemingly securing your
future. When friends ask, "What are
you doing this summer?," impress
them with a barrage of up-and-coming
Internet startups and obscure (but
quality) companies that you've "been
looking into." lake some time to sit
back and rub your palms together,
thinking about all the business devel
opment tasks you could be doing,
instead of what you should be doing
right that moment.
Create or complete your four-year
academic plan. Pet haps you made one
of these as an incoming freshman.
Surely you have some adjustments to
make by now. Whip out that Bulletin
(bonus points for people with old
lime Schedules on hand). Brainstorm
a way to double major, minor, write a
thesis and co-term. Toy with the idea
of learning a few foreign languages.
Try making three different four-year
plans, including every class, extracur
ricular activity and summer job for
three different career plans. Post these
on your bulletin board. Study and
compare. Call your Dad and ask what
he thinks. Believe me, this is a real
winner. I he folks love it.
And finally, plan future room
decor. 1 his involves multiple variables
and endless fun. Compile a wish list of
items you've always wanted for your
room, but never afforded or got
around to — futon, television, CD
rack, Lazy Boy, you name it. Then, get
on eßay and place bids while down
loading pictures of stereo systems. Or,
pay an unexpected visit to a graduat
ing friend or two, subtly scoping out
their pad.
"Hey — you selling that armchair?
Don't you think it's time for you to
invest in a DVD and trash that cum
bersome VCR?" Before you know it,
you've secured stylin' in-room furnish
ings guaranteed to extend your pro
crastination career long into next year.
Then, take a long, hard look at your
computer screen and type fora bit
until your next cycle of procrastina
tion.
And remember, anyone can waste
time. But to productively procrastinate
— that's a skill!
