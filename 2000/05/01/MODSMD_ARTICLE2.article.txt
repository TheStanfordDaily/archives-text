vision within the ASSU.

dents packed into the ASSU office
in Tresidcler Union to hear Elec
tions Commissioner Jason Rang

Villegas had defeated opponents
Ben I.in and Mike Dudas, also ju
niors. Newton and Villegas re
ceived 1,992 votes —,63.28 per
cent of the vote — while Liu and
Dudas earned 1,156 votes.
Only 23.68 percent of students
voted in the kv less rjfcm the
record 41.24 percent voter turnout

lor the general election held April I9
and 20.
Newton said lie was "feeling ec
static" after the victory. Villegas, via
cellular phone from Washington,
D.C., said, "the students have spo
ken."
Liu and Dudas congratulated
Newton and Villegas after the results
were announced.
Several constitutional c hallenges
remain pending that could invali
date the results.
However, ASSU Senator Nikki
Love, one of the few senators who
has not endorsed either slate during
the course of the election, said she
was glad that a winner was declared.
"1 was afraid of another lie or
near-tie, because that might have
sparked more contestations," Love
said. "Lin relieved that there isa de
finitive outcome — hopefully now
we can address these constitutional
issues quickly and finish up the elec
tion cycle."
Before Newton and Villegas
can .officially become president
and vice president, the ASSU Un-

dergraduate Senate and the (irad

certify the general election, and
vote later on certification of the
runoff election.
Complicating the validation and
certification process are six charges
questioning the constitutionality of
the election and events surrounding
the election. The charges were
raised last week by five members of
the GSC, with outgoing ASSU Pres
ident Mike Levin joining in two of
the complaints. The ASSU Consti
tutional Council will hear argu
ments Tuesday.
"I'm not too worried," Newton
said. " These are important con
cerns, and no matter what the result,
I think [the senate and the GSC] will
realize that letting this result stand is
what's lx*st for everyone."
But validation and certification
were far from the minds of Newton /
Villegas supporters Friday night.
"I'm ecstatic; it was worth it," said
Senate Chair Steven Aronowitz,
campaign manager for the victori
ous slate. "I'm not worried about
[the charges] now, but maybe I will
be in the morning."
I jevin, also a Newton and Villegas
supporter, said he's "just happy it's
over."
Although the Newton and Ville
gas slate received 14 demerits from
the ASSU Hearings Commission —

including eight for attempting lo
unethically violate the course of the
election— Jacinto Hernandez, a
PAC supporter, said "the severity of
the charges was not very high."
He added that when the Hear
ings Commission gave 14 demerits
to Newton and Villegas, many voters
did not understand the slate was
Ix-iug penalized, last Wednesday,
the GSC voted to not place the de
merits on the ballot.
"People heard 14 demerits, but
they didn't really know what that
meant," 1 lernandez said.
1 lenry Towsner, campaign man
ager for l.iu and 1 hidas, said lie
wished Newton luck.
"If he can do all he's promised,
that's great." Towsner, a freshman,
said he will continue to stay involved
in the ASSU, working on the Nomi
nations Committee.
Hie election was marked by an
unprecedented show of partisan
ship, with most senators publicly en
dorsing either Liu / Hildas or New
ton / Villegas.
Senator-elect Michael Osofsky, a
freshman, originally campaigned
for Liu and Dudas but decided to
endorse the PAC slate last Monday.
"Despite controversy, I stood by
what I felt was light for the future of
the ASSU," Osofsky said.
Senator-elect Serge Kassardjian,
a junior who will Ix- serving his sec
ond term next year, said, "During
the election, I was supporting lien
Liu and Mike Dudas because I

thought the) would have done an
excellent job, but I am now excited
to be working with Newton and Yil
legas.
"The election is now over, and
11 lis year's senate should have a verv
bright vear under the new presi
dent." he continued.
Freshman Matt Brewer, another
senator-elect affiliated with IWC,
said, "It was a great race, and I'm
glad to see the ASS I [will] address
traditional issues that affect us all."

in the general election.
"The low giad turnout is not as

were all counted as undergrads,"
said Flections Commission Techni
cal Spec ialist Eric Albert, a senior.
"This is a higher gracl turnout than
the last runoff."

lowed two weeks after the general
election, just .'V7 percent of graduate

A decisive victory by the presi
dential slate of Seth Newton and
Malia Villegas in Friday night's
runoff election ended a week
marred by accusations and sharp di
vision within the ASSU.

Shortly after midnight, 30 stu
dents packed into the ASSU office
in Tresidcler Union to hear Elec
tions Commissioner Jason Rang
announce that juniors Newton and
Villegas had defeated opponents
Ben I.in and Mike Dudas, also ju
niors. Newton and Villegas re
ceived 1,992 votes —,63.28 per
cent of the vote — while Liu and
Dudas earned 1,156 votes.

voted in the kv less rjfcm the
record 41.24 percent voter turnout

lor the general election held April I9
and 20.
Newton said lie was "feeling ec
static" after the victory. Villegas, via
cellular phone from Washington,
D.C., said, "the students have spo
ken."
Liu and Dudas congratulated
Newton and Villegas after the results
were announced.
Several constitutional c hallenges
remain pending that could invali
date the results.
However, ASSU Senator Nikki
Love, one of the few senators who
has not endorsed either slate during
the course of the election, said she
was glad that a winner was declared.
"1 was afraid of another lie or
near-tie, because that might have
sparked more contestations," Love
said. "Lin relieved that there isa de
finitive outcome — hopefully now
we can address these constitutional
issues quickly and finish up the elec
tion cycle."

can .officially become president
and vice president, the ASSU Un-

dergraduate Senate and the (irad

certify the general election, and
vote later on certification of the
runoff election.
Complicating the validation and
certification process are six charges
questioning the constitutionality of
the election and events surrounding
the election. The charges were
raised last week by five members of
the GSC, with outgoing ASSU Pres
ident Mike Levin joining in two of
the complaints. The ASSU Consti
tutional Council will hear argu
ments Tuesday.
"I'm not too worried," Newton
said. " These are important con
cerns, and no matter what the result,
I think [the senate and the GSC] will
realize that letting this result stand is
what's lx*st for everyone."
But validation and certification
were far from the minds of Newton /
Villegas supporters Friday night.
"I'm ecstatic; it was worth it," said
Senate Chair Steven Aronowitz,
campaign manager for the victori
ous slate. "I'm not worried about
[the charges] now, but maybe I will
be in the morning."
I jevin, also a Newton and Villegas
supporter, said he's "just happy it's
over."
Although the Newton and Ville
gas slate received 14 demerits from
the ASSU Hearings Commission —

including eight for attempting lo
unethically violate the course of the
election— Jacinto Hernandez, a
PAC supporter, said "the severity of
the charges was not very high."
He added that when the Hear
ings Commission gave 14 demerits
to Newton and Villegas, many voters
did not understand the slate was
Ix-iug penalized, last Wednesday,
the GSC voted to not place the de
merits on the ballot.
"People heard 14 demerits, but
they didn't really know what that
meant," 1 lernandez said.
