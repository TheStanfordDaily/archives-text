Srinivasan responds to accusers
1 would like to respond to the criticism
of my initial letter ('"Janitors' column miss
es the point") to The Daily printed on April
25. Notwithstanding the facile comparisons
to Nazism characteristic of many a leftist
rejoinder, several of the points my detrac
tors brought up are indeed worthy of con
sideration. Prime among them is the fact
that my economic analysis of the situation is
incomplete, as suggested by Jacquie Pratt
in her letter ("Srinivasan ignores larger
s<xial issues") dated April 26. I concur, as 1
failed to include the following three postu
lates in my initial statement :
1. Cost-benefit analysis need not be
wholly commcxlity centered, and indeed
cannot be. Costs and benefits include
things like psychological satisfaction and
ecological externalities.
2. An implicit or explicit cost-benefit
analysis guides every decision one makes.
3. The passive lac k of a positive action is
in practice equivalent to an active negative
action. Economists may recognize this as an
alternative definition of opportunity cost.
Taken together, these statements indi
cate to us that it may be profitable to regard
the matter of the janitors from a cost-bene
fit standpoint, beginning with a short cal
culation. The 1 lousing and Dining Services
Web site indicates that it employs 300 full
time and 750 pan time workers. If we
assume that approximately 500 fiill time
salaries are being paid to non-student

workers (e.g., 300 full time + 400 part
time), we can obtain an estimate for the cost
per student of applying the reforms that
the activist platform suggests. One of the
more prominent fliers indicates that the
goal is to make the janitors' poverty "a
memory," and Jennifer Wekselbaum's arti
cle ("All 1 need to know â€” 1 learned in my
dining hall") on April 20 states that the
highest paid janitors make $8 per hour.
We may begin with this as an upper
bound on the salary of workers. Assuming
a 40 hour week of work and 50 paid weeks
per year, we obtain an annual salary of
about $16,000.
Though it will take far more to lift a fam
ily out of poverty in the Bay Area, let us
consider the cost of raising the workers'
wages by $10,000 per annum. With 500
workers, this comes to $5 million. If this is
divided by the approximately 3,600 stu
dents who live in dorms and have Univer
sity meal plans, a figure also obtained from
the Housing and Dining Services Web site,
we obtain a per year increase of about
$1,400. Even if half of this is subsidized by
the University, those students living in
dorms would face a hike of $700 in their
bill.
Though costs are likely to be higher due
to the rather conservative assumptions
involved in the derivation, this number is
merely a first estimate. The point is that it
will take a considerable sum of capital to
achieve the desires of the activists, and that
this money must come from somewhere.

In her letter ("Responding to Srinivasan")
dated April 27, Jessica Bernstein-Wax cri
tiqued my assertion that the activists find it
easy to bemoan the evils of the reactionary
administration but would find it hard to
reach into their own pockets to pay for the
workers themselves. She suggested that
merely speaking out against the Universi
ty's policy does not put the student in the
position of employer. I believe that this cal
culation summarily puts that contention to
rest, as the students' responsibility for pay
ment of worker salaries via their board bill
makes them de facto employers.
Where does cost-benefit analysis fit into
the equation? Simply, each student who
will be affected by the price hike that will
inevitably follow a raise in janitorial wages
must evaluate their personal cost and ben
efit. ITiey must weigh the relative utility of
paying (say) $700 and gaining the psycho
logical benefit of improving Mr. Janitor's
wages versus the benefit of having $700 in
their pocket and facing the guilt of doom
ing Mr. Janitor to a hardscrabble existence.
When stated in these terms, however, it
seems to be an unspeakably monstrous
thing to choose to deny Mr. Janitor a better
life.
But the truth is that every person has
made this choice or a variant thereof. Each
person, consciously or not, has staked out a
position on the selfishness / altruism curve.
Because one's resources are finite, a trade-
