Srinivasan responds to accusers
1 would like to respond to the criticism
of my initial letter ('"Janitors' column miss
es the point") to The Daily printed on April
25. Notwithstanding the facile comparisons
to Nazism characteristic of many a leftist
rejoinder, several of the points my detrac
tors brought up are indeed worthy of con
sideration. Prime among them is the fact
that my economic analysis of the situation is
incomplete, as suggested by Jacquie Pratt
in her letter ("Srinivasan ignores larger
s<xial issues") dated April 26. I concur, as 1
failed to include the following three postu
lates in my initial statement :
1. Cost-benefit analysis need not be
wholly commcxlity centered, and indeed
cannot be. Costs and benefits include
things like psychological satisfaction and
ecological externalities.
2. An implicit or explicit cost-benefit
analysis guides every decision one makes.
3. The passive lac k of a positive action is
in practice equivalent to an active negative
action. Economists may recognize this as an
alternative definition of opportunity cost.
Taken together, these statements indi
cate to us that it may be profitable to regard
the matter of the janitors from a cost-bene
fit standpoint, beginning with a short cal
culation. The 1 lousing and Dining Services
Web site indicates that it employs 300 full
time and 750 pan time workers. If we
assume that approximately 500 fiill time
salaries are being paid to non-student

workers (e.g., 300 full time + 400 part
time), we can obtain an estimate for the cost
per student of applying the reforms that
the activist platform suggests. One of the
more prominent fliers indicates that the
goal is to make the janitors' poverty "a
memory," and Jennifer Wekselbaum's arti
cle ("All 1 need to know — 1 learned in my
dining hall") on April 20 states that the
highest paid janitors make $8 per hour.
We may begin with this as an upper
bound on the salary of workers. Assuming
a 40 hour week of work and 50 paid weeks
per year, we obtain an annual salary of
about $16,000.
Though it will take far more to lift a fam
ily out of poverty in the Bay Area, let us
consider the cost of raising the workers'
wages by $10,000 per annum. With 500
workers, this comes to $5 million. If this is
divided by the approximately 3,600 stu
dents who live in dorms and have Univer
sity meal plans, a figure also obtained from
the Housing and Dining Services Web site,
we obtain a per year increase of about
$1,400. Even if half of this is subsidized by
the University, those students living in
dorms would face a hike of $700 in their
bill.
Though costs are likely to be higher due
to the rather conservative assumptions
involved in the derivation, this number is
merely a first estimate. The point is that it
will take a considerable sum of capital to
achieve the desires of the activists, and that
this money must come from somewhere.

In her letter ("Responding to Srinivasan")
dated April 27, Jessica Bernstein-Wax cri
tiqued my assertion that the activists find it
easy to bemoan the evils of the reactionary
administration but would find it hard to
reach into their own pockets to pay for the
workers themselves. She suggested that
merely speaking out against the Universi
ty's policy does not put the student in the
position of employer. I believe that this cal
culation summarily puts that contention to
rest, as the students' responsibility for pay
ment of worker salaries via their board bill
makes them de facto employers.
Where does cost-benefit analysis fit into
the equation? Simply, each student who
will be affected by the price hike that will
inevitably follow a raise in janitorial wages
must evaluate their personal cost and ben
efit. ITiey must weigh the relative utility of
paying (say) $700 and gaining the psycho
logical benefit of improving Mr. Janitor's
wages versus the benefit of having $700 in
their pocket and facing the guilt of doom
ing Mr. Janitor to a hardscrabble existence.
When stated in these terms, however, it
seems to be an unspeakably monstrous
thing to choose to deny Mr. Janitor a better
life.
But the truth is that every person has
made this choice or a variant thereof. Each
person, consciously or not, has staked out a
position on the selfishness / altruism curve.
Because one's resources are finite, a trade-
oft must be negotiated between (lie benefit
of others ami (lie bene lit ol oneself. Taken
together with the ali>reiuentione(l fact that
a lack ola positive anion is a negative
action, this means that even person is
responsible for denying a bettei life to
someone in need. ( boosing to attend Stan
ford requires up to S12(),(K)() that could
have been used to immediately and materi
ally help the indigent. Choosing u> bu\
books or clothes <>i lovs or di inks denies <i
hot meal to every homeless person t li.it
needs one. 1 veil choosing to devote one's
life to helping the afflicted in CotintiA \
means that the destitute ol Countrv \ are
without aid.
My intent is not to foster a sense of
despair, but rather to awaken people to the
fact that others will suffer because of the
choices they make. Better to make these
choices with open eves and realize that the
opportunity cost of choosing to allocate
scarce resources to aiding an individual
means that s<niieone else is without aid. I lie
fact is that the janitors have been t hosen as
an issue because thev cause immediate, la< e
to-lace guilt and present a readilv available
situation, unlike the distant agonv of the
deprived of the 1 bird World.
While space does not permit a thorough
treatment of all the other issues brought up
by Carrie Dodson, Kric Ash ton, I'rati and
Bernstein-Wax (hereafier referred to as mv
critics), there was one point in particular
that seemed to incite considerable ire. I his
was mv assertion that those who chose to
have c hildren despite their inabilitv to pro
vide lor I hen i were irresponsible individu
als. The common theme of mv critics'
response was that every human being
deserves the abilitv to support a family.
While this sounds nobly humane in theory,
the reality of the situation is that the families
ol the extrenielv low income would have to
be subsidized in some manner. Notably,
there is no mention ol the lainilv sizes that
all people are entitled to. It is a statistical lac I
that lower income workers have more c hil
dren, a trend that is to everyone's detriment
given the eye-popping cost ol raising a
c hild. Whether the massive redistribution ol
wealth required to subsidize these families is
accomplished through direct funds transfei
or through indirect means such as the rais
ing of the worker's wage is immaterial.
Unless we are considering radical socialism,
deprivation will remain the best characteri
zati< >n of ihcVfttg c< mdi&Mis of tli(?se subsi

dized families. Simple div ision tells us it is in
their best interests to keep the family size
small in order to improve each member's
quality of lilt*. In a situation such as this, ii is
rational to advocate the economic benefits
of contraception lor extremely low income
families, especially considering the statisti
cally higher mean lainilv size, without Ibrc
ing the issue. I his is not Nazism — it is (onl
ine >n sense.
Bv keeping lainilv si/c low while wages
are insufficient to provide for mail)
mouths, workers can potentially position
themselves t<> train themselves to move into
another job ratliei than putting all depen
dents into the inienv iable situation of liv ing
below the poverty line. While the fault lies
with me for not making this link explicit,
mv original intent should be clear from the
fact that the job training I suggested is on
the line" right below the line of particular
offense.
I would like to close bv saving that this
passage and mv statements in general
reflect the lad that I have completed mv
personal cost-benefit calculation and found
that the costa large board bill hike would
impose is not worth the mental reward
gained Ibi alleviating the living conditions
ol the janitors. While I do not expect all stu
dents to share mv views, I believe that
inanv in the silent majority feel that the
potential of significantly increased cost is
unacceptable given the already high price
ol being a Stanford student. ()f course, the
cost-benelit analysis loi both myself and
other students would likely change
depending upon the plan formulated to
finance the janitorial wage increase. In an
ideal economic model, only those interest
ed in the well being of the janitors would
contribute to this increase, failing that, the
second best alternative is probably a refer
endum in which the population that will be
responsible for potentially financing this
increase is allowed to determine the
amount of the funding, similar to the spe
cial fee suggestion of niv initial letter.

A new perspective on Elian
In following the recent developments in
the Klian (lon/ale/ case and the response to
it, I feel that there is a portion of this case
that man\ people are unfamiliar with. In
response i<> |ason Rheins lettei to the edi
tor f.Y on Klian (.on/ale/' April

I J7), I feel that ii is crucial we examine the
legal aspects <>l the issue regarding Klian.
While in our eyes, the prospect of living
one's lile in Cuba may seem oppressive,
that should not be the real issue. 1 lie* real
issue is the welfare of the child and what is
in his best interests. In our ethnocentric
response, many leel that Klian would have
a better life in the I'nited Slates. Howev
er, we inusi ask whether or not the I nit
ed States escn has a right to die tale tliisr
from a legal aspect, there does not seem
to he am grounds for keeping Klian in this
country. In California, there exists a prece
dent which states that in ordei to lemove .1
child from a parent, there are two condi
tions which must be satisfied. I he lit si con
<liiion states that it must be in the I»csi inici
esis of the child to remain awa\ from the
parent, such as in foster care. I lie second
condition is thai ii inusi be shown that ii is
detrimental for the child to sia\ in custods
of the parent, 1 his usualls involves signs ol
abuse or psschological problems. 1 liese
precedents were established in the earls
19705, in a case c alled In re BG.
In this case, a father lied former
Czechoslovakia in H)(i8 with Ins two chil
dren, in a time of militan takeover In
Russia, lie arrived in California and
shorth thereaftei passed awas. Mis two
children were placed in loster care, and
soars later the mother popped back into
the scene, requesting custods of her chil
dren. During this court battle, the two
conditions mentioned above were estab
lished. I he precedent exists to present
children from being taken awas fbi no
compelling reason. Ii ma\ be in the best
interests of a child from South (lent nil I os
Angeles to grow up in I'alo Alto, however,
we can't go around taking children awas
from their parents simply because it is bet
ter lor the child.
In relation to the Klian (ion/ale/ case,
there does not appear to be am grounds
for him to remain in this country. 1 lowev
er. this becomes not a legal matter, but
rather an immigration matter as he is being
considered for political asvlum. I am not
stating that Klian would be better off in
( üba, but that we should be careful not to
jump to conclusions without being aware of
the whole story. We must remember that
Klian's mother took Klian out of the coun
tr\ without his father's permission, which
constitutes kidnapping.
I he media coverage of this matter has
been poor and did not provide objective
coverage of the saga involving the child.
While there are doubts in mv head regard
ing the actions (or inactions) of |uan (.011-
zales, we must attempt to put aside on 1

political view's on (aiba and concentrate on
what is best foi Klian. It is my hope that this
incident in Klian's life has not damaged
him psychologic alls and that he can soon
return to a relative!) not mal lifestyle, wher

Election controversy disturbing
Asa niembei ol the.YSSI Senate Asso
ciate loi the 1999-2000 school year, one of
the lew things that I could sas about the
ASS I' was that it was slowly gaining
respect in the Stanford community as
President Mike Kevin and the Under
graduate Senate made some really good
and helpful c hanges this vear. flius, what
disturbs me about the recent election
debacles is that the ASSU really has lost all
ol the respect it has fought so hard for,
and once again is seen campus-wide as a
pett\ political arena for the cutthroat
politicians of the future.
but this l< >ss of respect is not only a prod
uct ol outsiders, but in fact is a product of
those w ho win ked so hard to gain it. 1 think
that Kevin and the rest of the undergradu
ate senators, as well as the I'AC and the
Newton/ \ ilk-gas slate should be extreme-
Is ashamed of themselves for tearing down
the institution they have worked and
promised to build.
I would ask the student community to
please look hevond this election to the
accomplishments of the ASSU this sear to
which mans people have put in more
hours than thes are given credit lor. I'he
ASSI realls is an important institution for
Stanford and despite this small lapse, this

Clevenger mis-states issue of students on
Board of Trustees
We all owe Iv (ilevenger a debt for tak
ing on the Post Office; I've had it in mind
to urjjje him to turn his attention to the Palo
Alto Post ()lli< e, which also needs reform.
Hut he has turned his attention to argue
the case for students of"the Stanford Board
of" Trustees ("Stanford Hoard of Trustees
needs student input" April 27). Without
them, he savs, the u ustees cannot hope to

"know what's going on" in the University.
In order to make this argument, however,
he has to leave out a rather crucial but
inconvenient fact: Students sit as full voting
members on five of the six standing com
mittees of the Stanford Board. They have
done so for over 'JO years, and these com
mittees meet regularly in conjunction with
the meetings of the Board. The Board
takes actions upon the recommendations of
these committees.
Mr. (Revenger also makes no mention of
the principal argument against student
membership, which does not relate to their
relative youth and inexperience, but rather
to the nature and purpose of the Board.
Boards of trustees are not representative
governments; they are bodies that bear
fiduciary responsibility for the running of
the University. They earn this responsibil
ity, not to campus entities, but to the public
at large. Each trustee is duty bound to con
sider each issue that comes before the
Board from a comprehensive, institution
wide standpoint. The Board must not
become an advocate for any particular
interest within the institution, no matter
how worthy or important.
This means that what keeps students
(and faculty, who also sit on the Board
Committees) olf the Board itself is the
potential conflict of interest involved. All
Mr. (Revenger's rhetoric about how
"young doesn't necessarily mean irrespon
sible or incompetent," while true enough, is
simply beside the point.
Mr. Clevenger certainly has the right to
wish these circumstances were different,
and to argue fin changing them. What he's
not entitled to do is to argue as if they don't
exist.

inconvenient fact: Students sit as full voting
members on five of the six standing com
mittees of the Stanford Board. They have
done so for over 'JO years, and these com
mittees meet regularly in conjunction with
the meetings of the Board. The Board
takes actions upon the recommendations of
these committees.
Mr. (Revenger also makes no mention of
the principal argument against student
membership, which does not relate to their
relative youth and inexperience, but rather
to the nature and purpose of the Board.
Boards of trustees are not representative
governments; they are bodies that bear
fiduciary responsibility for the running of
the University. They earn this responsibil
ity, not to campus entities, but to the public
at large. Each trustee is duty bound to con
sider each issue that comes before the
Board from a comprehensive, institution
wide standpoint. The Board must not
become an advocate for any particular
interest within the institution, no matter
how worthy or important.
This means that what keeps students
(and faculty, who also sit on the Board
Committees) olf the Board itself is the
potential conflict of interest involved. All
Mr. (Revenger's rhetoric about how
"young doesn't necessarily mean irrespon
sible or incompetent," while true enough, is
simply beside the point.
Mr. Clevenger certainly has the right to
wish these circumstances were different,
and to argue fin changing them. What he's
not entitled to do is to argue as if they don't
exist.
RICHARD LYMAN
h ormn I'niuenity President
Srinivasan responds to accusers
1 would like to respond to the criticism
of my initial letter ('"Janitors' column miss
es the point") to The Daily printed on April
25. Notwithstanding the facile comparisons
to Nazism characteristic of many a leftist
rejoinder, several of the points my detrac
tors brought up are indeed worthy of con
sideration. Prime among them is the fact
that my economic analysis of the situation is
incomplete, as suggested by Jacquie Pratt
in her letter ("Srinivasan ignores larger
s<xial issues") dated April 26. I concur, as 1
failed to include the following three postu
lates in my initial statement :
1. Cost-benefit analysis need not be
wholly commcxlity centered, and indeed
cannot be. Costs and benefits include
things like psychological satisfaction and
ecological externalities.
2. An implicit or explicit cost-benefit
analysis guides every decision one makes.
3. The passive lac k of a positive action is
in practice equivalent to an active negative
action. Economists may recognize this as an
alternative definition of opportunity cost.
Taken together, these statements indi
cate to us that it may be profitable to regard
the matter of the janitors from a cost-bene
fit standpoint, beginning with a short cal
culation. The 1 lousing and Dining Services
Web site indicates that it employs 300 full
time and 750 pan time workers. If we
assume that approximately 500 fiill time
salaries are being paid to non-student

workers (e.g., 300 full time + 400 part
time), we can obtain an estimate for the cost
per student of applying the reforms that
the activist platform suggests. One of the
more prominent fliers indicates that the
goal is to make the janitors' poverty "a
memory," and Jennifer Wekselbaum's arti
cle ("All 1 need to know — 1 learned in my
dining hall") on April 20 states that the
highest paid janitors make $8 per hour.
We may begin with this as an upper
bound on the salary of workers. Assuming
a 40 hour week of work and 50 paid weeks
per year, we obtain an annual salary of
about $16,000.
Though it will take far more to lift a fam
ily out of poverty in the Bay Area, let us
consider the cost of raising the workers'
wages by $10,000 per annum. With 500
workers, this comes to $5 million. If this is
divided by the approximately 3,600 stu
dents who live in dorms and have Univer
sity meal plans, a figure also obtained from
the Housing and Dining Services Web site,
we obtain a per year increase of about
$1,400. Even if half of this is subsidized by
the University, those students living in
dorms would face a hike of $700 in their
bill.
Though costs are likely to be higher due
to the rather conservative assumptions
involved in the derivation, this number is
merely a first estimate. The point is that it
will take a considerable sum of capital to
achieve the desires of the activists, and that
this money must come from somewhere.

In her letter ("Responding to Srinivasan")
dated April 27, Jessica Bernstein-Wax cri
tiqued my assertion that the activists find it
easy to bemoan the evils of the reactionary
administration but would find it hard to
reach into their own pockets to pay for the
workers themselves. She suggested that
merely speaking out against the Universi
ty's policy does not put the student in the
position of employer. I believe that this cal
culation summarily puts that contention to
rest, as the students' responsibility for pay
ment of worker salaries via their board bill
makes them de facto employers.
Where does cost-benefit analysis fit into
the equation? Simply, each student who
will be affected by the price hike that will
inevitably follow a raise in janitorial wages
must evaluate their personal cost and ben
efit. ITiey must weigh the relative utility of
paying (say) $700 and gaining the psycho
logical benefit of improving Mr. Janitor's
wages versus the benefit of having $700 in
their pocket and facing the guilt of doom
ing Mr. Janitor to a hardscrabble existence.
When stated in these terms, however, it
seems to be an unspeakably monstrous
thing to choose to deny Mr. Janitor a better
life.
But the truth is that every person has
made this choice or a variant thereof. Each
person, consciously or not, has staked out a
position on the selfishness / altruism curve.
Because one's resources are finite, a trade-
oft must be negotiated between (lie benefit
of others ami (lie bene lit ol oneself. Taken
together with the ali>reiuentione(l fact that
a lack ola positive anion is a negative
action, this means that even person is
responsible for denying a bettei life to
someone in need. ( boosing to attend Stan
ford requires up to S12(),(K)() that could
have been used to immediately and materi
ally help the indigent. Choosing u> bu\
books or clothes <>i lovs or di inks denies <i
hot meal to every homeless person t li.it
needs one. 1 veil choosing to devote one's
life to helping the afflicted in CotintiA \
means that the destitute ol Countrv \ are
without aid.
My intent is not to foster a sense of
despair, but rather to awaken people to the
fact that others will suffer because of the
choices they make. Better to make these
choices with open eves and realize that the
opportunity cost of choosing to allocate
scarce resources to aiding an individual
means that s<niieone else is without aid. I lie
fact is that the janitors have been t hosen as
an issue because thev cause immediate, la< e
to-lace guilt and present a readilv available
situation, unlike the distant agonv of the
deprived of the 1 bird World.
While space does not permit a thorough
treatment of all the other issues brought up
by Carrie Dodson, Kric Ash ton, I'rati and
Bernstein-Wax (hereafier referred to as mv
critics), there was one point in particular
that seemed to incite considerable ire. I his
was mv assertion that those who chose to
have c hildren despite their inabilitv to pro
vide lor I hen i were irresponsible individu
als. The common theme of mv critics'
response was that every human being
deserves the abilitv to support a family.
While this sounds nobly humane in theory,
the reality of the situation is that the families
ol the extrenielv low income would have to
be subsidized in some manner. Notably,
there is no mention ol the lainilv sizes that
all people are entitled to. It is a statistical lac I
that lower income workers have more c hil
dren, a trend that is to everyone's detriment
given the eye-popping cost ol raising a
c hild. Whether the massive redistribution ol
wealth required to subsidize these families is
accomplished through direct funds transfei
or through indirect means such as the rais
ing of the worker's wage is immaterial.
Unless we are considering radical socialism,
deprivation will remain the best characteri
zati< >n of ihcVfttg c< mdi&Mis of tli(?se subsi

dized families. Simple div ision tells us it is in
their best interests to keep the family size
small in order to improve each member's
quality of lilt*. In a situation such as this, ii is
rational to advocate the economic benefits
of contraception lor extremely low income
families, especially considering the statisti
cally higher mean lainilv size, without Ibrc
ing the issue. I his is not Nazism — it is (onl

are insufficient to provide for mail)
mouths, workers can potentially position
themselves t<> train themselves to move into

dents into the inienv iable situation of liv ing
below the poverty line. While the fault lies
with me for not making this link explicit,
mv original intent should be clear from the
fact that the job training I suggested is on
the line" right below the line of particular
offense.
I would like to close bv saving that this
passage and mv statements in general
reflect the lad that I have completed mv
personal cost-benefit calculation and found
that the costa large board bill hike would
impose is not worth the mental reward
gained Ibi alleviating the living conditions
ol the janitors. While I do not expect all stu
dents to share mv views, I believe that
inanv in the silent majority feel that the
potential of significantly increased cost is
unacceptable given the already high price
ol being a Stanford student. ()f course, the
cost-benelit analysis loi both myself and
other students would likely change
depending upon the plan formulated to
finance the janitorial wage increase. In an
ideal economic model, only those interest
ed in the well being of the janitors would
contribute to this increase, failing that, the
second best alternative is probably a refer
endum in which the population that will be
responsible for potentially financing this
increase is allowed to determine the
amount of the funding, similar to the spe

Clevenger mis-states issue of students on
Board of Trustees
We all owe Iv (ilevenger a debt for tak
ing on the Post Office; I've had it in mind
to urjjje him to turn his attention to the Palo
Alto Post ()lli< e, which also needs reform.
Hut he has turned his attention to argue
the case for students of"the Stanford Board
of" Trustees ("Stanford Hoard of Trustees
needs student input" April 27). Without
them, he savs, the u ustees cannot hope to

"know what's going on" in the University.
In order to make this argument, however,
he has to leave out a rather crucial but
inconvenient fact: Students sit as full voting
members on five of the six standing com
mittees of the Stanford Board. They have
done so for over 'JO years, and these com
mittees meet regularly in conjunction with
the meetings of the Board. The Board

Clevenger mis-states issue of students on
Board of Trustees
We all owe Iv (ilevenger a debt for tak
ing on the Post Office; I've had it in mind
to urjjje him to turn his attention to the Palo
Alto Post ()lli< e, which also needs reform.
Hut he has turned his attention to argue
the case for students of"the Stanford Board
of" Trustees ("Stanford Hoard of Trustees
needs student input" April 27). Without
them, he savs, the u ustees cannot hope to

"know what's going on" in the University.
In order to make this argument, however,
he has to leave out a rather crucial but
inconvenient fact: Students sit as full voting
members on five of the six standing com
mittees of the Stanford Board. They have
done so for over 'JO years, and these com
mittees meet regularly in conjunction with
the meetings of the Board. The Board
takes actions upon the recommendations of
these committees.
Mr. (Revenger also makes no mention of
the principal argument against student
membership, which does not relate to their
relative youth and inexperience, but rather
to the nature and purpose of the Board.
Boards of trustees are not representative
governments; they are bodies that bear
fiduciary responsibility for the running of
the University. They earn this responsibil
ity, not to campus entities, but to the public
at large. Each trustee is duty bound to con
sider each issue that comes before the
Board from a comprehensive, institution
wide standpoint. The Board must not
become an advocate for any particular
interest within the institution, no matter
how worthy or important.
This means that what keeps students
(and faculty, who also sit on the Board
Committees) olf the Board itself is the
potential conflict of interest involved. All
Mr. (Revenger's rhetoric about how
"young doesn't necessarily mean irrespon
sible or incompetent," while true enough, is
simply beside the point.
Mr. Clevenger certainly has the right to
wish these circumstances were different,
and to argue fin changing them. What he's
not entitled to do is to argue as if they don't
exist.
RICHARD LYMAN
h ormn I'niuenity President
Srinivasan responds to accusers
1 would like to respond to the criticism
of my initial letter ('"Janitors' column miss
es the point") to The Daily printed on April
25. Notwithstanding the facile comparisons
to Nazism characteristic of many a leftist
rejoinder, several of the points my detrac
tors brought up are indeed worthy of con
sideration. Prime among them is the fact
that my economic analysis of the situation is
incomplete, as suggested by Jacquie Pratt
in her letter ("Srinivasan ignores larger
s<xial issues") dated April 26. I concur, as 1
failed to include the following three postu
lates in my initial statement :
1. Cost-benefit analysis need not be
wholly commcxlity centered, and indeed
cannot be. Costs and benefits include
things like psychological satisfaction and
ecological externalities.
2. An implicit or explicit cost-benefit
analysis guides every decision one makes.
3. The passive lac k of a positive action is
in practice equivalent to an active negative
action. Economists may recognize this as an
alternative definition of opportunity cost.
Taken together, these statements indi
cate to us that it may be profitable to regard
the matter of the janitors from a cost-bene
fit standpoint, beginning with a short cal
culation. The 1 lousing and Dining Services
Web site indicates that it employs 300 full
time and 750 pan time workers. If we
assume that approximately 500 fiill time
salaries are being paid to non-student

workers (e.g., 300 full time + 400 part
time), we can obtain an estimate for the cost
per student of applying the reforms that
the activist platform suggests. One of the
more prominent fliers indicates that the
goal is to make the janitors' poverty "a
memory," and Jennifer Wekselbaum's arti
cle ("All 1 need to know — 1 learned in my
dining hall") on April 20 states that the
highest paid janitors make $8 per hour.
We may begin with this as an upper
bound on the salary of workers. Assuming
a 40 hour week of work and 50 paid weeks
per year, we obtain an annual salary of
about $16,000.
Though it will take far more to lift a fam
ily out of poverty in the Bay Area, let us
consider the cost of raising the workers'
wages by $10,000 per annum. With 500
workers, this comes to $5 million. If this is
divided by the approximately 3,600 stu
dents who live in dorms and have Univer
sity meal plans, a figure also obtained from
the Housing and Dining Services Web site,
we obtain a per year increase of about
$1,400. Even if half of this is subsidized by
the University, those students living in
dorms would face a hike of $700 in their
bill.
Though costs are likely to be higher due
to the rather conservative assumptions
involved in the derivation, this number is
merely a first estimate. The point is that it
will take a considerable sum of capital to
achieve the desires of the activists, and that
this money must come from somewhere.

In her letter ("Responding to Srinivasan")
dated April 27, Jessica Bernstein-Wax cri
tiqued my assertion that the activists find it
easy to bemoan the evils of the reactionary
administration but would find it hard to
reach into their own pockets to pay for the
workers themselves. She suggested that
merely speaking out against the Universi
ty's policy does not put the student in the
position of employer. I believe that this cal
culation summarily puts that contention to
rest, as the students' responsibility for pay
ment of worker salaries via their board bill
makes them de facto employers.
Where does cost-benefit analysis fit into
the equation? Simply, each student who
will be affected by the price hike that will
inevitably follow a raise in janitorial wages
must evaluate their personal cost and ben
efit. ITiey must weigh the relative utility of
paying (say) $700 and gaining the psycho
logical benefit of improving Mr. Janitor's
wages versus the benefit of having $700 in
their pocket and facing the guilt of doom
ing Mr. Janitor to a hardscrabble existence.
When stated in these terms, however, it
seems to be an unspeakably monstrous
thing to choose to deny Mr. Janitor a better
life.
But the truth is that every person has
made this choice or a variant thereof. Each
person, consciously or not, has staked out a
position on the selfishness / altruism curve.
Because one's resources are finite, a trade-
oft must be negotiated between (lie benefit
of others ami (lie bene lit ol oneself. Taken
together with the ali>reiuentione(l fact that
a lack ola positive anion is a negative
action, this means that even person is
responsible for denying a bettei life to
someone in need. ( boosing to attend Stan
ford requires up to S12(),(K)() that could
have been used to immediately and materi
ally help the indigent. Choosing u> bu\
books or clothes <>i lovs or di inks denies <i
hot meal to every homeless person t li.it
needs one. 1 veil choosing to devote one's
life to helping the afflicted in CotintiA \
means that the destitute ol Countrv \ are
without aid.
My intent is not to foster a sense of
despair, but rather to awaken people to the
fact that others will suffer because of the
choices they make. Better to make these
choices with open eves and realize that the
opportunity cost of choosing to allocate
scarce resources to aiding an individual
means that s<niieone else is without aid. I lie
fact is that the janitors have been t hosen as
an issue because thev cause immediate, la< e
to-lace guilt and present a readilv available
situation, unlike the distant agonv of the
deprived of the 1 bird World.
While space does not permit a thorough
treatment of all the other issues brought up
by Carrie Dodson, Kric Ash ton, I'rati and
Bernstein-Wax (hereafier referred to as mv
critics), there was one point in particular
that seemed to incite considerable ire. I his
was mv assertion that those who chose to
have c hildren despite their inabilitv to pro
vide lor I hen i were irresponsible individu
als. The common theme of mv critics'
response was that every human being
deserves the abilitv to support a family.
While this sounds nobly humane in theory,
the reality of the situation is that the families
ol the extrenielv low income would have to
be subsidized in some manner. Notably,
there is no mention ol the lainilv sizes that
all people are entitled to. It is a statistical lac I
that lower income workers have more c hil
dren, a trend that is to everyone's detriment
given the eye-popping cost ol raising a
c hild. Whether the massive redistribution ol
wealth required to subsidize these families is
accomplished through direct funds transfei
or through indirect means such as the rais
ing of the worker's wage is immaterial.
Unless we are considering radical socialism,
deprivation will remain the best characteri
zati< >n of ihcVfttg c< mdi&Mis of tli(?se subsi

dized families. Simple div ision tells us it is in
their best interests to keep the family size
small in order to improve each member's
quality of lilt*. In a situation such as this, ii is
rational to advocate the economic benefits
of contraception lor extremely low income
families, especially considering the statisti
cally higher mean lainilv size, without Ibrc
ing the issue. I his is not Nazism — it is (onl

are insufficient to provide for mail)
mouths, workers can potentially position
themselves t<> train themselves to move into

dents into the inienv iable situation of liv ing
below the poverty line. While the fault lies
with me for not making this link explicit,
mv original intent should be clear from the
fact that the job training I suggested is on
the line" right below the line of particular
offense.
I would like to close bv saving that this
passage and mv statements in general
reflect the lad that I have completed mv
personal cost-benefit calculation and found
that the costa large board bill hike would
impose is not worth the mental reward
gained Ibi alleviating the living conditions
ol the janitors. While I do not expect all stu
dents to share mv views, I believe that
inanv in the silent majority feel that the
potential of significantly increased cost is
unacceptable given the already high price
ol being a Stanford student. ()f course, the
cost-benelit analysis loi both myself and
other students would likely change
depending upon the plan formulated to
finance the janitorial wage increase. In an
ideal economic model, only those interest
ed in the well being of the janitors would
contribute to this increase, failing that, the
second best alternative is probably a refer

A new perspective on Elian
In following the recent developments in

While in our eyes, the prospect of living

that should not be the real issue. 1 lie* real
issue is the welfare of the child and what is
in his best interests. In our ethnocentric

to he am grounds for keeping Klian in this

In this case, a father lied former

shorth thereaftei passed awas. Mis two
children were placed in loster care, and

children from being taken awas fbi no

interests of a child from South (lent nil I os

we can't go around taking children awas
from their parents simply because it is bet

In relation to the Klian (ion/ale/ case,
there does not appear to be am grounds
for him to remain in this country. 1 lowev

rather an immigration matter as he is being
considered for political asvlum. I am not

jump to conclusions without being aware of
the whole story. We must remember that
Klian's mother took Klian out of the coun

constitutes kidnapping.
I he media coverage of this matter has
been poor and did not provide objective

jump to conclusions without being aware of

Klian's mother took Klian out of the coun

constitutes kidnapping.
I he media coverage of this matter has
been poor and did not provide objective

Election controversy disturbing
Asa niembei ol the.YSSI Senate Asso
ciate loi the 1999-2000 school year, one of
the lew things that I could sas about the
ASS I' was that it was slowly gaining
respect in the Stanford community as
President Mike Kevin and the Under
graduate Senate made some really good
and helpful c hanges this vear. flius, what
disturbs me about the recent election
debacles is that the ASSU really has lost all
ol the respect it has fought so hard for,
and once again is seen campus-wide as a
pett\ political arena for the cutthroat
politicians of the future.
but this l< >ss of respect is not only a prod
uct ol outsiders, but in fact is a product of
those w ho win ked so hard to gain it. 1 think
that Kevin and the rest of the undergradu
ate senators, as well as the I'AC and the
Newton/ \ ilk-gas slate should be extreme-
Is ashamed of themselves for tearing down
the institution they have worked and
promised to build.
I would ask the student community to
please look hevond this election to the
accomplishments of the ASSU this sear to
which mans people have put in more
hours than thes are given credit lor. I'he
ASSI realls is an important institution for
Stanford and despite this small lapse, this
scar's senate, president and s ice- president
base been extreniels eflectise.

Clevenger mis-states issue of students on
Board of Trustees
We all owe Iv (ilevenger a debt for tak
ing on the Post Office; I've had it in mind
to urjjje him to turn his attention to the Palo
Alto Post ()lli< e, which also needs reform.
Hut he has turned his attention to argue
the case for students of"the Stanford Board
of" Trustees ("Stanford Hoard of Trustees
needs student input" April 27). Without
them, he savs, the u ustees cannot hope to

"know what's going on" in the University.
In order to make this argument, however,
he has to leave out a rather crucial but
inconvenient fact: Students sit as full voting
members on five of the six standing com
mittees of the Stanford Board. They have
done so for over 'JO years, and these com
mittees meet regularly in conjunction with
the meetings of the Board. The Board
takes actions upon the recommendations of
these committees.
Mr. (Revenger also makes no mention of
the principal argument against student
membership, which does not relate to their
relative youth and inexperience, but rather
to the nature and purpose of the Board.
Boards of trustees are not representative
governments; they are bodies that bear
fiduciary responsibility for the running of
the University. They earn this responsibil
ity, not to campus entities, but to the public
at large. Each trustee is duty bound to con
sider each issue that comes before the
Board from a comprehensive, institution
wide standpoint. The Board must not
become an advocate for any particular
interest within the institution, no matter
how worthy or important.
This means that what keeps students
(and faculty, who also sit on the Board
Committees) olf the Board itself is the
potential conflict of interest involved. All
Mr. (Revenger's rhetoric about how
"young doesn't necessarily mean irrespon
sible or incompetent," while true enough, is
simply beside the point.
Mr. Clevenger certainly has the right to
wish these circumstances were different,
and to argue fin changing them. What he's
not entitled to do is to argue as if they don't
exist.
