## Baseball triumphs in home run thriller Alvarado ends the game with a home run in the bottom of the ninth 
### TIM KANE STAFF WRITER 
Every kid has the fantasy. Bot
tom of the ninth, tie game, digging
in at the plate against your biggest
rival, the crowd screaming and the
pressure intense. I lie ending is al
ways the same-a crushing shot
launched over the outfield fence,
resulting in a thrilling win and a
hero's welcome at the plate for the
game-winning slugger.
Sunday afternoon, every kid's
dream became Damien Alvarado's
reality.
Alvarado, Stanford's senior
catcher, launched a game-winning
walk-off home run to right field in
the bottom of the ninth to give No.
4 Stanford a 12-11 victory over
Cal, culminating a riveting day of
baseball down on the farm and
giving the Cardinal (34-11, 13-5
Pacific-10 Conference) a 2-1 edge
for the weekend series with the
Colden Bears (24-24, 10-1 1).
The final game included,
among other things, six lead
changes, 23 total runs, 28 hits, six
home runs, and an enthusiastic
crowd of 3,710 that was treated to
the best game at Sunken Diamond
all year, with freshman Ryan Mc-
Cally (1-0) earning his first colle

giate win.
"I've never done anything like
this . . . but you always dream
about it," said Alvarado, who was
mobbed at home plate by his team
mates after the homer. "I was just
trying to get on base any way I
could. I lining a home run was the
last thing on my mind . . . After
the heartbreaking loss Friday (7-5,
in 1 I innings), to win like this is re
ally gratifying."
Most importantly lor the Cardi
nal, the win, combined with a loss
by Arizona State, leaves it one
game up on the Sun Devils with six
games left to play in the Pac-10
Conference games. Cal sinks to
fifth in the conference and had its
postseason hopes dealt a severe
blow at the hands of bead coach
Mark Marquess' squad.
"(ileal game, great crowd," said
Marquess after Sunday's back
and-forth game. "Tough for Cal to
lose like that - both of us were try
ing to find the pitchers to stop each
other. As a coach, I'd like to win 5-
0, but as a team, it's good. You
need to win games like this in the
postseason."
Lest anyone else be ignored, Al
varado was far from the Cardinal's
only hero on Sunday. Junior Joe
Borchard, coming off a day where
he participated in both the football
team's Cardinal and White game
(as a quarterback) and Saturday's
battle with Cal (as a riglufielder),
smashed two home-runs and drove
in four runs to pace the offense.
One of shots went 400
feet directly to straightaway cen
terfield, hitting the hatter's eye
fencing 35 feet off the ground and
drawing several open-mouthed
stares from the large crowd.
Even under the strain of com
bining spring football practice with
baseball games and practices, Bor
chard's hitting has led the Cardinal
on a string of impressive wins with
in the past three weeks, culminat
ing in his double-duty Saturday.
"1 think today was the pinnacle
of what the last three weeks have
been like," said lion hard after Sat
urday's game. "Coach Marquess
has been dealing with this for the
last three weeks, and the past two
years, for that matter, so it wasn't
that big of a deal. Probably his
main concern was just me gett ing
here on time."
After the pitching Marquess
witnessed from his staff this week
end, he may have cause to be more
than a little concerned. Stanford
pitchers gave up a total of 24 runs

in the three games with Cal, and
none of the team's starters,
whether Jason Young, Justin
Wayne, or Tim Cunningham,
looked particularly polished over
the weekend.
"I didn't feel like I was strug
gling," said Wayne, who has hit a
rough stretch recently. "What I'm
trying to do is gel into my old pat
terns, throwing more fastballs. For
the most part, the pitches weren't
what I wanted for the whole
game."
Young, who started Friday's
game, scattered eight hits and four
runs over eight and 1/3 innings,
but ended up with a no-decision
when he was lifted for Jeff Bruksch
in the ninth. In the 11th inning,
with two outs and runners on sec
ond and third, John Call and Eric
Bruntlett inisplayed a pop-up to
the left side of the infield, which
proceeded to drop in play as both
Cal players scored to put them up
for good, dropping Bruksch's
record to 2-3.
One bit of good news did
emerge out of the loss Friday , as
senior third baseman John Call
broke the Pac-10 record for career
hits, surpassing Arizona's Chip
Hale with a double down the left
field line in the bottom of the 11th

for career liii number *i3N.
On Saturday, Wayne didn't
look much better than Young had
the night before ; he got caught in
a couple light situations, but made
pitches he had to in order to es
cape without much damage. The
real damage came fi om Stanford's
bats in the sixth inning, and I))' the
time the dust had cleared Stanford
was sitting on a 7-2 lead after bat
tering Cal starter David Cash for
six runs in the inning.
The (iolden Bears added a four
more runs, but sophomores Mike
Gosling and Mike Wodnicki man
aged to prevent more severe dents
in the deficit, leaving Stanford
with a 1 ()-(> win. Wayne picked up
the victory, lipping his record to a
team-best 10-2.
After coming out of the Cal se
ries two out of three, the Cardinal's
objective for the rest of the season
becomes elementary. As Marquess
himself says, "If we can stay afloat .
. . we'll be playing UCfA in two
weeks for the Pac-lO [title]."
The coach may have temporar
ily forgotten ASU, but he's right-if
the Cardinal just to treads water
and doesn't get dragged under
with poor play, a Pac-10 title seems
likely in their future. And that is
definitely not a fantasy.
