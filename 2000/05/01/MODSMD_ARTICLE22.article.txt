## Baseball triumphs in home run thriller Alvarado ends the game with a home run in the bottom of the ninth 
### TIM KANE STAFF WRITER 
Every kid has the fantasy. Bot
tom of the ninth, tie game, digging
in at the plate against your biggest
rival, the crowd screaming and the
pressure intense. I lie ending is al
ways the same-a crushing shot
launched over the outfield fence,
resulting in a thrilling win and a
hero's welcome at the plate for the
game-winning slugger.
Sunday afternoon, every kid's
dream became Damien Alvarado's
reality.
Alvarado, Stanford's senior
catcher, launched a game-winning
walk-off home run to right field in
the bottom of the ninth to give No.
4 Stanford a 12-11 victory over
Cal, culminating a riveting day of
baseball down on the farm and
giving the Cardinal (34-11, 13-5
Pacific-10 Conference) a 2-1 edge
for the weekend series with the
Colden Bears (24-24, 10-1 1).
The final game included,
among other things, six lead
changes, 23 total runs, 28 hits, six
home runs, and an enthusiastic
crowd of 3,710 that was treated to
the best game at Sunken Diamond
all year, with freshman Ryan Mc-
Cally (1-0) earning his first colle

giate win.
"I've never done anything like
this . . . but you always dream
about it," said Alvarado, who was
mobbed at home plate by his team
mates after the homer. "I was just
trying to get on base any way I
could. I lining a home run was the
last thing on my mind . . . After
the heartbreaking loss Friday (7-5,
in 1 I innings), to win like this is re
ally gratifying."
Most importantly lor the Cardi
nal, the win, combined with a loss
by Arizona State, leaves it one
game up on the Sun Devils with six
games left to play in the Pac-10
Conference games. Cal sinks to
fifth in the conference and had its
postseason hopes dealt a severe
blow at the hands of bead coach
Mark Marquess' squad.
"(ileal game, great crowd," said
Marquess after Sunday's back
and-forth game. "Tough for Cal to
lose like that - both of us were try
ing to find the pitchers to stop each
other. As a coach, I'd like to win 5-
0, but as a team, it's good. You
need to win games like this in the
postseason."
Lest anyone else be ignored, Al
varado was far from the Cardinal's
only hero on Sunday. Junior Joe
