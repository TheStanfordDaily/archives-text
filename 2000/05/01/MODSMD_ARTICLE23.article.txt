# Women's tennis faces obstacles
## Stanford's top seeds absent in final rounds of Individual Championships 
### BILL HANSON STAFF WRITER 
With its top three players either missing, dehy
drated, or the victim of an early-round loss by the sec -
ond day of the tournament, it seemed unlikely that
the Cardinal would make much of an impact at this
year's Pacific 10 Conference Individual Champi
onships in ()jai, Calif.
Sophomores Lauren Kalvaria and Keiko Tokuda,
however, had other ideas. Kalvaria, who plays No. 4
singles for the Cardinal, and Tokuda, who competes
at the No. 7 position, both reached the semifinals be
fore tailing in straight sets to the eventual finalists.
As the t<nirnament got underway on I hursday, the
Cardinal, with five players competing in the 32-play
er singles draw, seemed primed to walk away with the
title. Although defending champion Marissa Irvin,
the Cardinal's No. 1 player, was skipping the tourna
ment due to scheduling conflicts, the Cardinal still
boasted two top title-contenders, freshman Laura
(iranville, ranked third in the nation, and senior vet
eran Teryn Ashley.
By Friday, however, the Cardinal's chances
seemed much slimmer.
Granville, who plays No. 2 singles for Stanford,
made it through two rounds before defaulting her
quarterfinal match due to dehydration.
Meanwhile, Ashley, ranked third on the Cardinal

ladder, was upset in the second round In nemesis
Karin Palme of Arizona State.
Stanford, however, quickly proved that it lias a
deeper line-up than any other school in the nation.
