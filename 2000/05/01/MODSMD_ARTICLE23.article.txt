# Women's tennis faces obstacles
## Stanford's top seeds absent in final rounds of Individual Championships 
### BILL HANSON STAFF WRITER 
With its top three players either missing, dehy
drated, or the victim of an early-round loss by the sec -
ond day of the tournament, it seemed unlikely that
the Cardinal would make much of an impact at this
year's Pacific 10 Conference Individual Champi
onships in ()jai, Calif.
Sophomores Lauren Kalvaria and Keiko Tokuda,
however, had other ideas. Kalvaria, who plays No. 4
singles for the Cardinal, and Tokuda, who competes
at the No. 7 position, both reached the semifinals be
fore tailing in straight sets to the eventual finalists.
As the t<nirnament got underway on I hursday, the
Cardinal, with five players competing in the 32-play
er singles draw, seemed primed to walk away with the
title. Although defending champion Marissa Irvin,
the Cardinal's No. 1 player, was skipping the tourna
ment due to scheduling conflicts, the Cardinal still
boasted two top title-contenders, freshman Laura
(iranville, ranked third in the nation, and senior vet
eran Teryn Ashley.
By Friday, however, the Cardinal's chances
seemed much slimmer.
Granville, who plays No. 2 singles for Stanford,
made it through two rounds before defaulting her
quarterfinal match due to dehydration.
Meanwhile, Ashley, ranked third on the Cardinal

ladder, was upset in the second round In nemesis
Karin Palme of Arizona State.
Stanford, however, quickly proved that it lias a
deeper line-up than any other school in the nation.

Sophomore Lauren Kalvaria, the No. 4 seed for the Car
dinal, reached the semi-finals of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Individual Championships where she fell to UCLA's
Sara Walker.
In a tournament fraught with
upsets, kalvaria, ranked 13th na
tionally, won three hard-fought
matches before falling to UCLA's
Sara Walker, the eventual champi
on, in the semifinals, 6-4, 6-0.
In the first round, Kalvaria took
out Washington State's Ana
Moura, 6-7, 6-0, 6-1. Kalvaria fol
lowed up her win over Moura with
a tenacious 6-3, 7-5 triumph over
UCLA's No. 2 player, Annica
Cooper.
In the quarterfinals, she won a
thrilling three-setter over LSC's

No. I player, Kara Warkentin, 2-6,
6-1,7-6.
"Lauren toughed out three
tough matches over two days,"
Tokuda said. "And both days were
reallv hot. We were frying out
there, and we all were tired and
worried about midterms. Sara
Walker's a great hitter, but the
semifinal was closer than the
score."
Tokuda easily dispatched
UCLA's Amanda Basic a in the first
round, 6-2, 6-3, before upsetting
ninth-ranked Trojan Jewel Peter
son, 4-6, 6-4, 6-0, in the second
round.
"Going down there, knowing
that I was going to play Basica,
w ho's always been a great player,

was difficult," Tokuda said. "I had
turned in a paper the night before
so I hadn't gotten much sleep, but
I played really well. Against Jewel
[Peterson], I was really tired and
lost the first set. But 1 knew that I
had beaten her earlier in the year,
so once 1 won the second set, I
knew 1 had her in the third."
Although she won her quarter
final match with Granville by de
fault, despite the extra rest, Toku
da was overpowered by 15th
ranked Allison Bradshaw of Ari
zona State in the semifinals, 6-2,6-
4.
"She's a big girl and she hits the
ball very, very hard," Tokuda said.
"In the first set, 1 was just retriev
ing, and then I was down 2-5 in the

second. But I broke her for the
first time to get to 3-5, and then
held to 4-5. She was down 15-40 in
that game but then I broke a
string, and after that, mentally, I
was just out of it."
Regardless, Tokuda should be
pleased with her performance. Be
cause she also sports a perfect sin
gles record in dual match play, she
may qualify for the NCAA Individ
uals with her impressive weekend
result. Kalvaria has already quali
fied for the NCAA's.
" There's still a reality I have to
face," Tokuda said. "I'm number
seven on the team and I haven't
that many matches. But I'd love to
get into tiie NCAA's."
