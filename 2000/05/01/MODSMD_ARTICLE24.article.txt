sophomores Gabe Jennings and
Mark Hassel and junior Michael

A 1:46-plus split from Jennings
helpetl catapult Stanford into the
lead, and the Cardinal held the
lead through Hassel's leg despite

his recent return from injury.
Stember was last to tour the
track tor the Cardinal. Bolting to a
1:47-plus split, Stember appealed
to be victory bound. But Missouri's
Derrick Peterson, last year's NCAA

seconds, dismantling the competi
tion.
Stanford's final time of 9:32.83
crushed the closest competitor bv
more than seven seconds.
"We came here thinking we
were the bomb," Jennings said.

good we really can be. Today's
race proves that."
" This jnst shows that all our
hard work is paying off," Hassel
said. "All those hours we have put

in training, it all has paid off."
