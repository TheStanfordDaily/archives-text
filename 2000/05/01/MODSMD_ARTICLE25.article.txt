name of the Men's Pacific 10 (lon
ference Individual Champi
onships to the Stanford Individ
ual (lhainpionships.
Yesterday afternoon, senior
Geofl Abrams of the No. 1 Stan
ford men's tennis team defeated
teammate and doubles partner
junior Alex Kim in a thrilling 7-6,
6-7, 6-1 battle to capture the sin
gles title of the Men's Intercolle
giate Pac-10 Championships, the
tournament's main draw, at Ojai.
f"he (Cardinal has now won
lour straight Pac-10 individual
men's singles titles and seven in
Ihe List 10 vears.
Willi the victory, Abrams,
ranked eighth in the nation, has
now won an amazing 22 matches
straight. He has not lost in singles
since he dropped a three-setter to
|ef! Laski of Illinois on Feb. 24 at
the Nat ional I'eani Indoor
(lhampionships.
Yesterday's match was the third
time this season that the Stanford
doubles partners have liiced each
other in a tournament final. Kim,
currentlv ranked sixth in the na
tion, defeated Abrams, 6-4, 1-6, 6-
I. at the 1 I A Regionals in Seattle
on Nov. 9 and, 6-3, 6-2, at the Na
tional Collegiate I ennis Classic in
I'lions;nid ()akson Jan. 10.

However, as the No. I doubles
team in the nation with an amaz
ing 32-6 record, Kim and Abrams
are more used to playing with each
other than against each other.
Both Abrams and Kim had to
defeat the Pac-10's top players to
reach the finals.
In an all-Stanford semifinal,
Abrams defeated sophomore K. J.
Hippensteel, ranked No. 15 in
the nation, 6-2, 6-4. Like his
teammates, Hippensteel had a
very impressive showing in the
tournament, including a 6-4, 7-6
win over No. 37 Jong-Min Lee,
I ClA's top player.
In the quarterfinals, Abrams
eliminated Bruin All-American
Jean-Noel Grinda, 7-5, 6-3.
Kim advanced to the finals
with a pair of straight-set victories
over other ranked opponents
from UCLA. He cruised by No.
73 Jean-Julien Rojer, 6-4, 6-1, in
the semifinals and No. 3N Bran
don Kramer, 6-1, 6-1, in the
quarterfinals. Kim is now 37-7 on
I lie season and 19-3 against Pac
-10 opponents.
As a whole, all eight Stanford
plavers who went to Ojai did a
fantastic job.
Like tlie Men's Intercollegiate
Pac-10 Championships, three

ers on each Pac-10 team.
In one semifinal, Ansari ad

of 16 host sites for the first and sec
ond rounds on May 13-14. The
