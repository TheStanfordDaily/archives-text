# Transsexual Bornstein explores gender through monologues
## Performance focuses on identity question; unique performance part of Queer Awareness Week 
### EILEEN CHAO STAFF WRITER 
He is a 52-year-old man. She is a 14-
year-old girl. Together, they are Kate
Bornstein. In her performance of
"Y2Kate" Saturday night in Kresge Audi
torium, Bornstein, a transsexual who un
derwent genital conversion surgery al
most 14 years ago, questioned the mean
ing of being male or female through a set
of"several dramatic monologues.
"I lived as a man for the first 37 years of
my life," Bornstein said. "Not a day in my
life have I not thought about gender. I
was born and assigned one gender, and
now I live my life as completely something
else."
Senior Jami Datnow, one of the event's
coordinators, said she felt the perfor
mance was a breakthrough event for the
Stanford community.
[Kate] "brought a dimension to Stan
ford that we've never experienced be
fore," Datnow said. "I've never been to a

performance so proud that Stanford
would bring someone like her to speak."
Dressed in a tiny black tank-top and
tight leather pants with platform boots,
Bornstein described many of her experi
ences with the conflict of gender by taking
on roles of not only other people but of
herself in the past. She explained how at
first, the only job she could get as a trans
sexual was as a phone sex operator.
"One man said to me, 'Stormy, (that
was the name 1 chose for myself), with a
voice like that yon were born to be a
phone sex operator,' " Bornstein said.
"And I thought to myself, 'no 1 wasn't!' "
Bornstein said that when she was male,
she tried to eat and drink all her problems
away. But at one point, she decided that
enough was enough, and tried to figure
out who she really was.
"I shed my addictions like snakes would
shed their skin, until there was only me
left," Bornstein said. "I was left naked,
someone who I thought 1 really was."
Questions of gender still arose in her
mind. Bornstein said that when she finally
got the genital conversion surgery, she felt
that everything would be alright. Finally,
after years of mental anguish about who
she really was, she could have the true body
of a female. But the surgery was not the
final answer.
"There were still silent wars in my
mind," Bornstein said. "1 had to learn to

be a'woman.' I was never taught to handle
[male jeers.] I realized being a woman just
brought up a whole new set of problems."
Slu* said she didn't exactly find a place
in either sex. And so she came to under
stand that she was neither, becoming a
transsexual.
"I'm not a man. I'm not a woman. I'm
playing make believe- and out of'all of'my
options, 1 like being a girl best," she said. "I
don't understand the people who want me
to be a man, and I don't understand the
people who want me to be a woman."
Many of the subjects touched on last
night were personal, deep and graphic.
However, many people in the audience
were pleased that Horn stein openly dis
cussed such personal and controversial is
sues.
"1 he combination of her openness and
candor was admirable," Datnow said.
"This, [along with] her unique character,
willingness to share and sense of humor"
made the event intriguing.
Bornstein asked jokingly several times
throughout the night, "Is ii OK for me to
use [this word] iu an academic confer
ence?" She explained that she used graph
it and profane words only because that
was the way she talked and she wanted to
feel comfortable talking to the audience.
"The language of my people is different
from the language of your people," she
said. "I'm sorry il it sounds like profanity

in your language."
The performance attracted about 130
people, with 80 people staying for the
questions and answer session afterwards,
according to head coordinator Elly Mat
sumura, a senior. She said she felt the
event was a brilliant success.
"The fact so many people attended
even when we didn't get that many fliers
out showed that it was something people
were really looking forward to seeing,"
Matsumura said. "The way Kate raised
questions instead of giving answers was
really radical and respectful to the audi
ence."
Senior Suzannah Tipermas agreed that
the event gave those in attendance much
to think about.
"It was a wonderful success, especially
for the audience, who was very perceptive
to it," Tipermas said. "Kate has a wonder
ful way of opening up people's minds. It's
something I wish everyone could have
seen."
Bornstein was also part of a larger pre
sentation earlier in the clay called "Queer
in the Mirror: a Symposium on Body
Image and Identity," held all clay in
Tresidder Union. The event included
workshops and discussion on gay, bisexu
al and transsexual experiences as well as
speakers on issues such as "looking
queer," body image in Asian communities,
and aging in gay, lesbian, bisexual and

transsexual communities.
"It was phenomenal - I hope the issue
of self (and gender and self-image) became
complicated for the participants, and I
hope the conference raised questions that
hadn't been addressed before," said event
coordinator David Goehring, a senior.
"Our keynote, [Bornstein,] was instru
mental in initiating that questioning."
The issue of the self is exactly what
Bornstein threw out to her audience in
"Y2Kate." She emphasized the question:
"Are you really a man/woman? Why? Do
you really know who you are?" She even
passed out a gender aptitude test. Many
people, she said, are confused, and they
aren't alone.
"I am nothing new in this world," Born
stein said. "It'sjust that my people haven't
had much opportunity to speak out."
Bornstein said she has accepted her
transsexual nature, but added that it has
been a long, hard road. She is neither male
nor female, but a transsexual — constant
ly metamorphosing, becoming "the kind
of person I'm attracted to."
"I'm living and dying the genders I'm
traveling through," Bornstein said. "By
the time the next seven years come and go,
I'm going to have my girl skin shed, right
along with my male skin, my boy skin, my
lesbian skin."
"Take a g<x>d kx>k now because I'm
changing already."

coordinator David Goehring, a senior.
"Our keynote, [Bornstein,] was instru
mental in initiating that questioning."
The issue of the self is exactly what
Bornstein threw out to her audience in
"Y2Kate." She emphasized the question:
"Are you really a man/woman? Why? Do
you really know who you are?" She even
passed out a gender aptitude test. Many
people, she said, are confused, and they
aren't alone.
"I am nothing new in this world," Born
stein said. "It'sjust that my people haven't
had much opportunity to speak out."
Bornstein said she has accepted her
transsexual nature, but added that it has
been a long, hard road. She is neither male
nor female, but a transsexual — constant
ly metamorphosing, becoming "the kind
of person I'm attracted to."
"I'm living and dying the genders I'm
traveling through," Bornstein said. "By
the time the next seven years come and go,
I'm going to have my girl skin shed, right
along with my male skin, my boy skin, my
lesbian skin."
"Take a g<x>d kx>k now because I'm
changing already."
He is a 52-year-old man. She is a 14-
year-old girl. Together, they are Kate
Bornstein. In her performance of
"Y2Kate" Saturday night in Kresge Audi
torium, Bornstein, a transsexual who un
derwent genital conversion surgery al
most 14 years ago, questioned the mean
ing of being male or female through a set
of"several dramatic monologues.
"I lived as a man for the first 37 years of
my life," Bornstein said. "Not a day in my
life have I not thought about gender. I
was born and assigned one gender, and
now I live my life as completely something
else."
Senior Jami Datnow, one of the event's
coordinators, said she felt the perfor
mance was a breakthrough event for the
Stanford community.
[Kate] "brought a dimension to Stan
ford that we've never experienced be
fore," Datnow said. "I've never been to a

performance so proud that Stanford
would bring someone like her to speak."
Dressed in a tiny black tank-top and
tight leather pants with platform boots,
Bornstein described many of her experi
ences with the conflict of gender by taking
on roles of not only other people but of
herself in the past. She explained how at
first, the only job she could get as a trans
sexual was as a phone sex operator.
"One man said to me, 'Stormy, (that
was the name 1 chose for myself), with a
voice like that yon were born to be a
phone sex operator,' " Bornstein said.
"And I thought to myself, 'no 1 wasn't!' "
Bornstein said that when she was male,
she tried to eat and drink all her problems
away. But at one point, she decided that
enough was enough, and tried to figure
out who she really was.
"I shed my addictions like snakes would
shed their skin, until there was only me
left," Bornstein said. "I was left naked,
someone who I thought 1 really was."
Questions of gender still arose in her
mind. Bornstein said that when she finally
got the genital conversion surgery, she felt
that everything would be alright. Finally,
after years of mental anguish about who
she really was, she could have the true body
of a female. But the surgery was not the
final answer.
"There were still silent wars in my
mind," Bornstein said. "1 had to learn to

be a'woman.' I was never taught to handle
[male jeers.] I realized being a woman just
brought up a whole new set of problems."
Slu* said she didn't exactly find a place
in either sex. And so she came to under
stand that she was neither, becoming a
transsexual.
"I'm not a man. I'm not a woman. I'm
playing make believe- and out of'all of'my
options, 1 like being a girl best," she said. "I
don't understand the people who want me
to be a man, and I don't understand the
people who want me to be a woman."
Many of the subjects touched on last
night were personal, deep and graphic.
However, many people in the audience
were pleased that Horn stein openly dis
cussed such personal and controversial is
sues.
"1 he combination of her openness and
candor was admirable," Datnow said.
"This, [along with] her unique character,
willingness to share and sense of humor"
made the event intriguing.
Bornstein asked jokingly several times
throughout the night, "Is ii OK for me to
use [this word] iu an academic confer
ence?" She explained that she used graph
it and profane words only because that
was the way she talked and she wanted to
feel comfortable talking to the audience.
"The language of my people is different
from the language of your people," she
said. "I'm sorry il it sounds like profanity

in your language."
The performance attracted about 130
people, with 80 people staying for the
questions and answer session afterwards,
according to head coordinator Elly Mat
sumura, a senior. She said she felt the
event was a brilliant success.
"The fact so many people attended
even when we didn't get that many fliers
out showed that it was something people
were really looking forward to seeing,"
Matsumura said. "The way Kate raised
questions instead of giving answers was
really radical and respectful to the audi
ence."
Senior Suzannah Tipermas agreed that
the event gave those in attendance much
to think about.
"It was a wonderful success, especially
for the audience, who was very perceptive
to it," Tipermas said. "Kate has a wonder
ful way of opening up people's minds. It's
something I wish everyone could have
seen."
Bornstein was also part of a larger pre
sentation earlier in the clay called "Queer
in the Mirror: a Symposium on Body
Image and Identity," held all clay in
Tresidder Union. The event included
workshops and discussion on gay, bisexu
al and transsexual experiences as well as
speakers on issues such as "looking
queer," body image in Asian communities,
and aging in gay, lesbian, bisexual and

transsexual communities.
"It was phenomenal - I hope the issue
of self (and gender and self-image) became
complicated for the participants, and I
hope the conference raised questions that
hadn't been addressed before," said event
coordinator David Goehring, a senior.
"Our keynote, [Bornstein,] was instru
mental in initiating that questioning."
