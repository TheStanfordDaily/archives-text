### GREG PAGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last week, a large proportion of male students on
campus received a mass-mailed letter from an anony
mous male in search of gay companionship.
Dean of Students Marc Wais said, "We've contact
ed the Stanford Police Department about the letter,
primarily out of concern regarding student privacy.
[We've also contacted] the University Registrar's Of
fice.
"We are concerned as to how an individual 3,000
miles away appears to have gotten access to student
post office addresses," he said.
The letter writer claimed to be a recent Harvard
graduate getting ready to move to California.
Student reactions to the letter were mixed.

"I was shocked yet somewhat flattered," said John
Darcy, a sophomore.
Sophomore Isaiah Camp saicl his initial reaction
was to wonder why he received the letter. "Who
thinks I'm gay?" asked (lamp.
Others downplayed the letter.
"In the end it's junk mail,"said senior Ashish Vora.
"Maybe there is someone behind it with real inten
tions of meeting people, but this isn't the best way to
go about doing it."
Senior Brian Hoffman said, "I don't think it's too
big a deal, I'm not concerned about it."
Upon receiving the letter, many students won
dered if it was some sort of prank.
"1 thought it had to be a [group playing a| joke.
How could one person have so
many stamps?" said Darey.
Senior Corey Griffin noted that
the postage alone "is an extrava
gant amount of money, whether
it's a prank or it it's real."
Griffin hypothesized that the
letter might he part of something
else entirely.
"I think it would bean interest
ing psych experiment," Griffin
said, "I low willing is a population
of male college students at a major
university to tell someone, some
what anonymously, that they are
seeking homosexual companion
ship as well?"
I lie letter begins, "Hello. At
the risk of seeming weird, I am
mailing this letter to male students
at a few of the country's top col
leges. I graduated from Harvard
recently, and this is my situation: I
am attracted to guys, but not to
any of the ga\s I have met.
"I decided to try the unortho
dox hut more exhaustive ap
proach of sending out this letter."
The letter concludes with a ex
hort ion to contact the author, and
