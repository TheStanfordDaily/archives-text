### JESSICA TUCKER-MOHL EDITORIAL STAFF 
I he outcome ol both the runoff
election and the original April 19-
20 election remains uncertain in
light of complaints submitted to
the ANSI Constitutional Council
last week.
Several members of the ASSI'
Klections Commission responded
over the weekend to the six com
plaints filed hist Wednesday with
the council, the ASSU's judicial
body. They objected to several as
pects of the complaints and raised
questions about their legitimacy.
ASSU Hearings OHicer Katie
Young, a junior, also submitted a
formal request this weekend ask
ing C louncil ('hair Harris Shapiro,
a doctoral student in physics, to re
move himself from the six cases.
Young spoke on behalf of the
Commission, saving, "we feel that
there is no way we will be able to

get a fair hearing" with Shapiro.
The request was refused by
Shapiro, who stated, "I have al
ready established a record of res
ponding to both plaintiff and de
fendant requests and complaints
in an impartial manner, in accor
dance with the governing docu
ments of the ASSU."
Complaints to council
Young and Klections Commis
sioner Jason Rang, a coterminal
student in economics, were named
in the complaints, in addition to
the Undergraduate Senate, the
Elections Commission and four
student staff members of The Stan
ford Daily.
"A few ol [the charges] will
hopefully be deemed frivolous, but
we still need to validate this elec
tion and certify [both elections],"
