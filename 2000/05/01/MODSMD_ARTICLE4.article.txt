# Hearings to focus on constitutionality
## 
### JESSICA TUCKER-MOHL EDITORIAL STAFF 
I he outcome ol both the runoff
election and the original April 19-
20 election remains uncertain in
light of complaints submitted to
the ANSI Constitutional Council
last week.
Several members of the ASSI'
Klections Commission responded
over the weekend to the six com
plaints filed hist Wednesday with
the council, the ASSU's judicial
body. They objected to several as
pects of the complaints and raised
questions about their legitimacy.
ASSU Hearings OHicer Katie
Young, a junior, also submitted a
formal request this weekend ask
ing C louncil ('hair Harris Shapiro,
a doctoral student in physics, to re
move himself from the six cases.
Young spoke on behalf of the
Commission, saving, "we feel that
there is no way we will be able to

get a fair hearing" with Shapiro.
The request was refused by
Shapiro, who stated, "I have al
ready established a record of res
ponding to both plaintiff and de
fendant requests and complaints
in an impartial manner, in accor
dance with the governing docu
ments of the ASSU."
Complaints to council
Young and Klections Commis
sioner Jason Rang, a coterminal
student in economics, were named
in the complaints, in addition to
the Undergraduate Senate, the
Elections Commission and four
student staff members of The Stan
ford Daily.
"A few ol [the charges] will
hopefully be deemed frivolous, but
we still need to validate this elec
tion and certify [both elections],"
Rang said.
Daily officers also responded to
a complaint directed towards spe
cific actions regarding the investi
gation of campaign violations.
The six complaints, submitted
by five members of the Graduate
Student Council, address the con
stitutionality of several procedur
al aspects of the ASSU elections,
including the demerit system for
recording elections violations, the
1 ight to privacy for those charged
with violations and campaign re
strictions on spending, sending e
mail and posting flyers.
With a hearing before the
council scheduled for Tuesday,
Elections Commission members
this weekend questioned the way
accusations were directed at indi
viduals rather than the entire
commission or the .ASSU Under
graduate Senate. Commission
members also sought further clar
ification about several of the com
plaints.
Validity of runoff questioned
Rang stated that the joint by
laws of the Senate and the Gradu
ate Student Council require that
an election go through the
process of validation, but not nec
essarily the process of certifica
tion. Rang said that the election
was validated on the Tuesday and
Wednesday following the first
election, permitting the runoff to
be held this past Thursday and
Friday.
However, Shapiro, said that
the regulations regarding certifi
cation of the election had changed
last April, combining certification
and validation into one action,
named "certification." Since the
first election wasn't certified, ac
cording to Shapiro, the runoff
election may be found invalid.
Shapiro said that he was re
sponsible for implementing the
changes that were made last
spring, and unfortunately, he
said, clarification of the new certi
fication policy "may have been
overlooked" and thus the current
by-laws require only validation.
GSC member Chris
Stromberg, a doctoral student in
chemistry, submitted a letter to
the Council on Friday asking that
the election results be upheld de
spite possible violations of ASSU
policy.
"Even given the portions of the
by-laws quoted by the plaintiffs,
the runoff election is not invalid,"
said Stromberg, citing Appendix
11.1.A.3 of the joint by-laws, stat
ing "Runoff elections shall be held
within 14 days of the preceding
election, provided that validation
...has occurred..."
"Even if you find that any of
this runoff does violate the Consti
tution or by-laws, 1 would ask that
you still let the results of the run
off election stand," he wrote to the
Council, based on the "good faith"
efforts of the Elections Commis
sion and the fact that any subse
quent election would take place
after the law school has begun
their finals.

Specific constitutional violations
The letter from the Elections
Commission members states that
all charges brought before the
council must allege specific viola
tions of the ASSU Constitution, ac
cording to sections 1V.2.A, which
states: "[the] Constitutional Coun
cil shall adjudicate all cases where
the [constitutionality] of an act by
the Senate of the Association, the
President of the Association or any
member or members of the Associ
ation is called into question."
One of the complaints from the
group of GSC members targeted
the runoff, alleging that it was un
constitutional because it was held
too close to the certification
process for the general election.
The rules addressing runoff elec
tions, and the processes for certifi
cation and validation of elections,
appear in the ASSU by-laws, not
the constitution, and the Commis
sion members say that those rules
are therefore out of the Council's
jurisdiction.
Similarly, commission mem
bers requested that the council
specify the charges relating to the
demerit system and the right to
privacy violations against Young.
They argued that the current
charges are overly vague, because
they do not reference to specific
clauses of the constitution.
"Many of the complaints that
were filed failed to name a defen
dant or a proper defendant, or
failed to name an act or name a
part of the Constitution," Young
said. "We will be filing for dis
missals [of the complaints]...before
we do, the Constitutional Council
needs to clarify [these issues.]"
The Stanford Daily response
Officers of the Stanford Daily
also responded to the complaints
submitted to the Constitutional
Council. A complaint stated that
four Daily staff members — Man
aging Editor Dana Mulhauser,
Editor in Chief Ritu Bhatnagar,
News Editor Marisa Pavlik and
Staff Writer Megan Knize— vio
lated the confidentiality of those
charged with elections violations.
In a letter to the council, the
four staff members wrote, "this
council does not have jurisdiction
to judge our conduct or to hear
complaints other than those di
rectly involving ASSU officers and
employees discharging the powers
of their offices."
Shapiro's role as chair
Young stated that Shapiro had
made negative comments about
her ability to do her job. She said
that due to this and the fact that
one of the plaintiffs on the six com
plaints is his roommate, disquali
fies him from serving as chair.
"1 have respect for Harris," she
said, "but not for his ability to give
us a fair hearing."
"The issue is whether any of us
has formed a previous opinion
about the actions involved in the
current cases before the council,"
Shapiro said, "and whether such
previous opinions prevent an im
partial evaluation of the case."
He said he was "puzzled" by the
demands to remove himself.
