# Departments skirt housing hurdles in faculty recruitment
## Stanford continues to attract talent despite high housing costs and competition 
### BEN ALEXANDER-BLOCH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Although University President
Cierhard (lasper has cited hous
ing as one of the major challenges
in attracting faculty, Stanford still
manages to recruit some of the
best faculty in the nation.
Stanford offers competitive
salaries, but new faculty must still
consider the high expense of liv
ing in Palo Alto before signing on.
" I he cost of housing was the
major obstacle, and in the end
Stanford came through here.
But fora long time in the recruit
ing process I didn't see how we
could possibly afford to live in
this area, and in fact it is tjuite a
challenge," said Assoc. Prof. |im
Fearon, a recent addition to
Stanford's Political Science De
partment after leaving the Uni
versity of (1 hi( ago.

Weingast said funds and loans
are available for faculh through
University housing programs.
Mm. he noted that while approx
imately 1,600 faculty and 1,100
staff are eligible for on-cainpns
housing, there are only N42 facul
ty houses on campus.
Academics first
Despite housing concerns, a

professor's decision to come to
Stanford often rests on the
strength of the individual depart
ment in which thev might teat h.
"The fundamental attraction
to Stanford is the quality of its stu
dents, particularly its graduate
students," saitl Prof. Mruce Woo
ley, chair of the Klecirital Kngi
neering Department.
Math Department Chair Leon
Simon said, "Academically, the
strength of the department, .is
well as how the current faculty
members feel the new professor
would lit into the department,
are key factors" in recruiting new
faculty.
In deciding on Stanford.
Fearon saitl he"was attracted
most of all bv a really terrific po
litical science department, possi
blv the best in the country. I he
overall qualit\ of the social sci
ence research and teaching .it
Stanford were .ilso big draws."
Weingast saitl that the Political
Science Department is currently

one of the top departments in the
country and hasn't had a prob
lem attracting new faculty. He
said that out of the ten job offers
the department has recently
made, nine professors have de
rided to come to Stanford, a vir
tually unheard-of yield rate.
Competing for talent
Other department chairs also
said that the strength of their de
partments helped in recruiting
faculty away from other schools.
At the moment Stanford has
one of the top math departments
in the nation, according to
Simon. Last year other universi
ties tried to lure away some pro
fessors, but the department man
aged to keep its talent In making
strong counteroffers.
Weingast said Harvard L'ni
versity has recently tried to re
cruit some of Stanford's political
science professors. But so far

Harvard's been un
successful, and the department
lias even managed to attract one
I larvard professor to Stanford.
Political Scienfce Prof. David
Laitin came to Stanford from the
University of Chicago.
"Last year 1 received offers
from both Harvard and Stan
ford. After a series of counter-of
fers, I basically had similar finan
cial packages from all three
places. Stanford, to be sure, had
to put up more money into hous
ing in order tor inc to come out
each month equal to other
places. But in the end the finan
cial deal had nothing to do with
my decision," Laitin said.
"My decision was based princi
pally on my scholarly goals for
the next decade."
