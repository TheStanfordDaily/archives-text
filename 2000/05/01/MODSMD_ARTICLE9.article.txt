Chronicle will go to court
over purchase of Examiner
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The future of newspaper
competition in San Francisco will Ik.- shaped in federal
court this week as the Hearst Corp. defends its purchase
of the San Francisco Chronicle and its subsidized give
away of the San Francisco Examiner.
A lawsuit by (Mint Reilly, a former mayoral candidate
and an unsuccessful biddei for the Examiner, contends
the Chronicle purchase was ringed and the Examiner's
transfer to a local publisher is a sham, designed to give
Hearst a local newspaper mono|x>ly after more than a
century of competition.
/Ml three publisher— Hearst, the Chronicle Publish
ing Co., and Ted Fang, owner of a free local newspaper
chain and prospective publisher of the Examiner — say
their transactions will promote competition, not destroy
it.
Il»e U.S. Justice Department found no antitrust viola
tions in the sale and approved the dissolution of the joint
operating agreement under which the Chronicle and Ex
aminer have been published since 1965. The agreement,
which combines business operations but keeps editorial
staffs separate, was scheduled to run through 2005.
But U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker, who is pre
siding over the non-jury trial, stunned the publishers by
issuing a restraining order against the Chronicle sale
March 30, a day before it was to be completed.
Walker said the purpose of the federal law that autho
rized the joint operating agreement — to keep founder
ing newspapers afloat — would not be served if the trans
actions that ended the joint operating agreement were
designed to let only one paper survive.
