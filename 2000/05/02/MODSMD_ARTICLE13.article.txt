U
Leland Stanford, railroad tycoon and
benefactor of Stanford University, must have
known how hard it is to stop a runaway train
when it's coming full speed down the line.
This weekend, the Stanford women's rugby
team managed to do just that when it brought
the Princeton juggernaut to a halt in the final
game of the national tournament. After a sea
son of seemingly limitless victory, an injury
wracked women's rugby team (13-2) fell just
short of the national title.
Having crushed Marquette Saturday, 21 -
5, to advance to the final game of the USA
Rugby National Tournament, Princeton lost to
the Cardinal in overtime the next day, 43-31,
in University Park, Pa. Stanford had defeated
Navy to advance to the finals.
The strength of the Cardinal came as no
surprise to Princeton, however. Instructed by
the USA Women's National team coach,
Stanford had built uprecord and had even
defeated traditionally strong Air Force at
home in Colorado Springs, Col., to make it to
the Final Four. The Cardinal is also one of the
quickest teams in the country.
