# Bush and Gore clash over budget and Social Security

WASHING lON (Al>)
George W. Bush and A1 Gore arc
both straining to keep their
promised tax cuts and spending
boosts from the political sin of
eroding Social Security surpluses,
a <, I<rsc ;yr w i'aeh candidate's
budget-'|"rhiiTxhoUs.
In the first presidential cam
paign in decades waged amid fed
eral surpluses, the two men have
similar strategies.
Hodi promise billions for what
their tore supporters want most.
Both also omit details about
painful steps needed to sta\ with
in their budgets, and accuse the
other guy of breaking the bank.
A major economic downturn
could transform projected federal
surpluses into deficits.
but, if anything, Hush and
Gore should benefit when official
forecasts are updated this sum
mer because most anahsts expect
the economic boom to push pio
jected surpluses highei still, leav
ing more mone\ fbi both of their
proposals.
"Their economic advisers are
counting on significanth increased
projections to make honest men
out of .til of them," said Henry
Aaron, a senior fellow at the liber
al-leaning Brookings Institution.
For now, though presidential
candidates' budgets are more polit
ical platforms than fiscal
blueprints, both men's proposals
raise questions.
By the bush campaign's own
numbers, the Republicans five
year plan — headlined by his $483
billion tax cut — would c lip Social
Security surpluses slighth and
chain the entire surplus he projects
from the rest of the federal budget.

I lie Texas governor projects a
five-vear, $580 billion surplus from
non-Social Securilv programs — a
number expected to rise when the
campaign releases a new estimate
based on April federal tax collec
tions. But, using figures provided
In aides, his tax cut plus proposals
to boost spending for health,
schools, defense and other pro
grams would total $588.0 billion.
I hat means Bush would use
$2.0 billion of the nearly $l trillion
in Social Security surpluses expect
ed front 2002-2000, or about 0.26
percent. That figure has little bud
getary significance, but underlines
the difficulty of leaving politically
sacrosanct Social Security money
alone.
More important, Bush's pro
posals could cost billions more
because his plan excludes the costs
of lost interest savings, a new Medi
care prescription drug benefit, or
other proposals.
And to arrive at his surplus fore
cast, Bush assumes the govern
ment will spend tens of billions of
dollars less annually than many
lawmakers of both parties believe is
possible. I le provides no details.
Gore says that Bush's plan is
"casino economics," that its hefi\
lax cut will crowd out needed
spending. But Bush aides say he
will soon detail federal waste that
could provide additional savings to
help pay.
Bush would also use an unspec -
ified amount of the Social Security
surplus to subsidize new , voluntary
personal retirement accounts,
investments that would supple
ment traditional Social Security
benefits.
lie has provided no details on

that. But one frequently discussed
plan on Capitol llill cited by aides
would use 2 percent of the current
12.4 percent payroll tax that
finances Social Security, or about
$85 billion a year.
That would mean less money
foY (Ht/bf Bush aides
sav the higher return likely on such
investments would mean better
overall retirement plans for Amer
icans and less pressure on Social
Security.
C lore's plan covers 10 years and
is not directly comparable to
Bush's.
Largely because he assumes
higher spending and a slightly
weaker economy than Bush built
into his plan, the vice president
says the non-Social Security sur
plus will total $740 billion over the
next decade.
Democrat Gore would use that
money — plus an additional $130
billion in savings largely from rais
ing taxes on tobac co and some cor
porate transactions — fora $250
billion tax cut, an expansion of
health-insurance coverage, a new
Medicare prescription drug bene
fit, debt reduction and $34 billion
worth of still unannounced in it ia
t ives.
Congress has repeatedly reject
ed President Clinton's calls for
tobacco and corporate taxes, rais
ing questions about where Gore
would actually get that money.
Separately, Gore wants $115 bil
lion more for education. And he
has talked about $9 billion more
for cancer research, $5 billion a
year more to help states expand
preschool and unspecified increas
es for Internet technology and
foreign aid.
