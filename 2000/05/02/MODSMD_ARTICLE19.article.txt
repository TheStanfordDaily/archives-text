## The 						Stanford Daily ASSU election crisis rooted in last year's split 
### 
Published Since JS9I

Tl IK I)F.CISI()N TO split the ASSU Sen
ale into two groups — the Undergrad
uate Senate and the Graduate Student
(louncil ((iS('.) — has been the source of
unnecessary division within the ASSU during the
election season. Precisely as predicted by last
year's Daily editorial board, the amendment that
proposed this has created foreseeable problems.
At the heart of the problems surrounding the
creation of a separate governing body for gradu
ate students is its inherently divisive nature. 1 lie
ASSU is supposed to represent a unified student
governing body of students. To be fair, the cre
ation of the (;SC was supposed to serve to unify
both groups by allowing each an equal voice.
lu actuality, this year's election has shown a
marked widening of the gap between Stanford's
graduate and undergraduate student popula-

tions. Disputes about the election process c ulmi
nated in five (ISC senators charging the Under
graduate Senate of violating constitutional guide
lines. This is hardly unity.
More importantly, however, is that such seri
ous division probably would not have occurred
under the old system of ASSU organization. This
split, rather than distributing voice more equally
or increasing interest in graduate student govern
ment, has led to a contentious and war-like elec
tion, shedding a decidedly negative light on the
ASSU for many students.
This election has seen the GSC and Under
graduate Senate engage in a painfully circular
process of passing legislation and striking it down,
creating a perception in the student body of the
GSC as a sort of roadblock organization.
Whatever the problems with this perspective,

I lit* fact remains that the existence of such per
ceptions is a direct result of the absence of dia
logue between the two bodies. Using the Consti
tutional Council as a sort of middle man, they
have effectively avoided addressing each other
directly, resulting in divisive misunderstandings
and the debacle of charges we have before us
today.
It is important to recognize that, in theory, the
notion of the split seemed to he good one, giving
graduate students a higher-profile voice in stu
dent government. However, some of the motiva
tions behind this move showed a lac k, of knowl
edge of how a government should work.
112 he foundation laid for the running of the
CSC showed a lack of forethought. By mandating
that consensus majority would be required for all
decision-making by the council, an already

•lengthy process became slightly unrealistic.
The GSC was also not given the same level of
constitutional protection on its inception as the
Undergraduate Senate. By-laws can be created, or
even abolished, by a two-thirds majority of coun
cil members present, meaning the structure and
procedure of this body can be disrupted.
There are valid needs for having separate
forums for undergraduate and graduate voice in
the ASSU. Perhaps a separate senate body is not
the best way to meet those needs. Regardless, il
the ASSU is to succeed in representing the entire
student body, it must first find a way to foster a
sense of community and open and productive dia
logue within the organization itself — that is to
say, between the Undergraduate Senate and the
(ISC. Then, and only then, will all student voice
be clearly represented and heard.
