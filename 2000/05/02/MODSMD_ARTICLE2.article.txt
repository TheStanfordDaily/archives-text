ing a "May Da) l eadi-In" designed to educate the
Stanford comniimit\ about the labor movement

About 30 people staved lor the whole event,
though over 100 people stopped In to sign petitions
urging I niversitN President Cerhard Casper to
support the campus' janitors in then "Justice for
Janitors" campaign.
According to freshman Clara Webb, a member of
SI.AC, this event was held in conjunction with the

Service Employees International I nion'sJustic e lor
Janitors Campaign, which is current l\ taking place
across the country. The campaign has been most
visible in Los Angeles, where 4,000 janitors went on
strike and recently settled a new contract with raises
and return-to-work bonuses from their contractors.
Stanford janitors belong to SEIL Local 1577,
which is currently negotiating a contract with Silicon
Valley contractors.
"SI AC is actively supporting this campaign for
better wages In urging Stanford to set an example
in Silicon Valley bv ensuring that its janitors receive
a livable wage," Webb said.

May Day event.
junior Jen Wekslebaum, a mem
ber of SI AC, talked about stu
dents' role in the labor move
ment and Stanford's responsibil
ity to its workers.
After the speeches there was a
question and answer session with
several people who chose to
share some of their experiences.
Manley described the origins
of May Day, which began in
1886 when workers across the
country united to demand an
eight-hour workday. The Chica
go Haymarket Square Incident
occurred during this strike and
resulted in the hanging of four
labor organizers. Manley said
many call the 1886 uprising the
beginning of the modern labor
o O
movement.
"Since then, May 1 has been a
day to rally for labor issues," said
Wekslebaum.
Lolita Roibal, a freshman
member of SLAC, said, "we just
want everyone to remember
what May Day is all about — to
know that the labor movement is
reviving in the US. We want to be
a part of it. Unions really lost a lot
of ground the last two decades,
and the money they make is
much less than before — in cur
rent dollars, janitors made about
12 and now they only make 8

[dollars an hour].
"It is immoral fora university
— a leader in Silicon Valley and
in the academic world — to dis
respect the people it employs.
The purpose of the University is
to produce research and scholars
capable of improving the stan
dard of living for all people; it's a
hypocrisy when the University
contributes to oppression," Wek
slebaum said.
According to Roibal, "What
was really cool about it for me is
that in about the last four or five
events and actions that SI AC has
had — they have all been great
opportunities to network with
other students, organizations,
unions and community mem
bers.
"We are drawing together a
lot of power to support janitors
and workers and create an open
minded discussion of how our is
sues are connected on campus . .
. The movement is growing."
Wekslebaum emphasized that
the student role is to support the
janitors, not to lead the cam
paign.
"The role of students is to . . .
educate our peers and the com
munity, to call attention to the
janitors' struggle, to use the ed
ucational resources of the Uni
versity to do research for the
campaign, and to use what
power we have as students in
this University to convince those
in power that people deserve to
have their basic needs met."
