# FARM LIFE
## On our current crisis 
### 
Hi, my name is Chris, and I so
don't care about the ASSU
elections, re-elections, re-re
re-re-elect ions and so on. Of
the 10 million people listed for senate, I
voted lor both the people I knew and
then those w hose names sounded cool.
For the presidents, both of my class
.uid the I ltra-Super-Duper Lord High
Presidency, I voted for, again, the coolest
name or, il I recognized someone, for

litem. ASS I" special
fues funding? Yeah,
again, those groups I
knew, thought
deserved funding, et
Cetera. $:«),()()() for .1
Solar C.ar. Whatever.
Man, the money we
just throw around.
What a iiisli whilst vot
ing! And let's he honest

that's how most of us voted.
Win u 11 rvnicism and apathy? Well,
to he honest, this isn't a new feeling of
mine. I used to t all my high school's com
-1111111 it\ council"the puppet govern
ment," and I apply that to this situation as
well. I have no idea what goes 011; I have
no time to know what goes 011, and, so
long as m\ si.tins <|iio is maintained, that's
line.
II I want something to change or am
uuhappv with something, there are plen
t\ ol more < onstriu live means available. I
(.111 form a group, start a petition, orga
ni/e a ralh, vou name it. I hat sort of pol
itic s gets things done; that's the sort of
politics we should he up in arms about.
Ihit not this ASS I stuff.
Yes, the VS.SI has a purpose, and an
import.nit one at that — helping to
ensure the smooth flow of Stanford life.
But 11 is NO I politic sin the Washington
sense. It is a mass of student voices at the
lahleot I Diversity voices. And these voic
es tend io he taken with a large grain of
salt regardless. I he recent "election cri
sis or, even worse, the positing of the
ahsiirdit\ of new elections— I find both
almost disgusting.
II there was some sort of major, pan
[ niversitx crisis that the ASSU somehow
would have .1 part in, I'd feel different,
lint what's going on now is almost a
nicK ker\ ol the democratic system. Talk
about making mountains out of molehills!
I alk about being out of touch!
Look at Nigeria, Zimbabwe, East
I imoi. Russia and a host of similar places
in the Real World, and there you will see
the importance of elections, the kernel of
democracy — and serious problems.
Here at Stanford, however, the serious
problems are lac king.
What I ask, therefore, is what on earth

the 40 zillion letters to the editor, the e
inails with 110 end and the like are seeking
to accomplish? The last I c hecked 1 am at
Stanford to get an education — for me, in
economics and AAAS and not in the idio
cy of triviality. Be thankful t hat there was
enough enthusiasm from the apathetic
mass of Us to care to vole in the first place.
I particularly love the possible "uncon
stitutionality of demerits." Am I really
supposed to think it's an abuse of rights?
1 wonder if what I'm seeing is more a
bunch of fellow students — on both sides
— anxious to put "ASSU [whatever]" 011
their resume in the middle of job-hunting
season rather than some fellow students
truly concerned about due process and
justice — even 011 this trivial level.
Again, I ask, what on earth is this all
supposed to accomplish, especially in the
greater scheme? Because all I see light
now is a massive waste of paper, e-mail
space and my and everybody else's time.
Now then, before I get off my little
soap-box here, let me say that we ran sal
vage all this. We can move on. We can
come back down to reality, and think
hard about this "crisis." I he ASSU should
continue to function as always, doing
whatever it is that it does, and with
whomever is supposed to be there. Per
sonally, it doesn't matter to me who that
is. Kvery group had the same sillv name,
the same basic ideas, and, most impor
tantly, the same capacity of power should
they get the position — YT.RY little.
In the greater scheme, it really does
not matter; as I said before, this is not the
U.S. Congress or the presidency, this is
the ASSU we're talking about here. It's
just like community counc il, but one step
up. A collegiate-level popularity contest
with the same level of vagueness.
So maybe I do care. I care about the
insanity of the present outlook on the
current situation. As students, we com
plain about being labeled as out-01-touch
with the Real World, as whiny competi
tive brats who should know better. 1 hope
we know that is not true, but our present
behavior doesn't help.
I firmly believe that we are a commu
nity of vastly different, but also vastly
intelligent, students. We really should rise
above this pettiness and take things more
normally rather than blow them hugely
out of proportion. How about special
ASSU funding for election monitoring
NOOs? It's beginning to sound like we
might need their aid very soon indeed.
What with our huge crises and all.

You can talk nasty to ('.ln is at
(maloney(u)leland. He is definitely considering
tunning for ASSU senate next year because
he'd like to "wake a difference."

ahsiirdit\ of new elections— I find both
almost disgusting.
II there was some sort of major, pan
[ niversitx crisis that the ASSU somehow
would have .1 part in, I'd feel different,
lint what's going on now is almost a
nicK ker\ ol the democratic system. Talk
about making mountains out of molehills!
I alk about being out of touch!
Look at Nigeria, Zimbabwe, East
I imoi. Russia and a host of similar places
in the Real World, and there you will see
the importance of elections, the kernel of
democracy — and serious problems.
Here at Stanford, however, the serious
problems are lac king.
What I ask, therefore, is what on earth

the 40 zillion letters to the editor, the e
inails with 110 end and the like are seeking
to accomplish? The last I c hecked 1 am at
Stanford to get an education — for me, in
economics and AAAS and not in the idio
cy of triviality. Be thankful t hat there was
enough enthusiasm from the apathetic
mass of Us to care to vole in the first place.
I particularly love the possible "uncon
stitutionality of demerits." Am I really
supposed to think it's an abuse of rights?
1 wonder if what I'm seeing is more a
bunch of fellow students — on both sides
— anxious to put "ASSU [whatever]" 011
their resume in the middle of job-hunting
season rather than some fellow students
truly concerned about due process and
justice — even 011 this trivial level.
Again, I ask, what on earth is this all
supposed to accomplish, especially in the
greater scheme? Because all I see light
now is a massive waste of paper, e-mail
space and my and everybody else's time.
Now then, before I get off my little
soap-box here, let me say that we ran sal
vage all this. We can move on. We can
come back down to reality, and think
hard about this "crisis." I he ASSU should
continue to function as always, doing
whatever it is that it does, and with
whomever is supposed to be there. Per
sonally, it doesn't matter to me who that
is. Kvery group had the same sillv name,
the same basic ideas, and, most impor
tantly, the same capacity of power should
they get the position — YT.RY little.
In the greater scheme, it really does
not matter; as I said before, this is not the
U.S. Congress or the presidency, this is
the ASSU we're talking about here. It's
just like community counc il, but one step
up. A collegiate-level popularity contest
with the same level of vagueness.
So maybe I do care. I care about the
insanity of the present outlook on the
current situation. As students, we com
plain about being labeled as out-01-touch
with the Real World, as whiny competi
tive brats who should know better. 1 hope
we know that is not true, but our present
behavior doesn't help.
I firmly believe that we are a commu
nity of vastly different, but also vastly
intelligent, students. We really should rise
above this pettiness and take things more
normally rather than blow them hugely
out of proportion. How about special
ASSU funding for election monitoring
NOOs? It's beginning to sound like we
might need their aid very soon indeed.
What with our huge crises and all.

You can talk nasty to ('.ln is at
(maloney(u)leland. He is definitely considering
tunning for ASSU senate next year because
he'd like to "wake a difference."
