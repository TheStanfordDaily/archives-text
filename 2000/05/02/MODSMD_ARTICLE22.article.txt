Elections Commission officers respond to
constitutional charges
I hill the student body is wondering
why the Elections Commission took their
jobs in the first place. You'd have to be
nuts to spend the better part of your
quarter passing up progressives and pub
nights in the name of the ASSU. We
acknowledge this, liut seized by a strange
ethereal impulse to run fair election, we
became impervious to common sense —
for the second year in a row.
We've done our In-st to run a fair elec
tion and are now the brunt of personal
and political angst that has found a happy
outlet in the Constitutional Council.
We have mulled over the following: 1.
I he charges originated from personal
and political spite. 2. We believe the
charges are frivolous. !$. The Constitu
tional Council has refused to answer the
majority of our requests to clarity the
charges. 4. The Constitutional Council
has informed us that the "rights of the
accused" do not apply to us — which
means we won't necessarily be allowed to
talk at the meeting, offer a rebuttal or call
witnesses on our behalf. 5. Despite
alleged bias against us. the (louncil's chair
has refused to recuse himself.
Bluntly, we're not taking the bait any
more. We won't be dignifying the Coun
cil meeting with nervous deferential pres
ence, nor will we be submitting neatly
typed double-spaced arguments 72 hours

iii advance. We're done playing games.
We're taking our ball and going home.
1 he Constitutional Council does not
have the power to burn us at the stake,
tar and feather us or even give us firm
noogies. The most they can do is call a
new election. Civen that the charges are
frivolous and that the acts in question
apparently had no effect on voters, would
it really be wise to do this? Would the
Association applaud another week of
nasty e-mails and neon fliers? Not bloody
likely. We certainly wouldn't —and Elec
tions Commission members don't exactly
grow on trees.
This letter has a second purpose as
well. We began these jobs apolitically and
have remained that way. Our stints on
the Elections Commission have given us
some insight on the ASSIJ, and elections
in particular. We submit the following
modest revelation: If you are a student
who's never had a desire to be part of stu
dent government, you should really give
it some thought.
I he ASSU is richly diverse in some
ways and much less so in others. More
than anything, it could benefit from the
involvement of some individuals who will
bring a fresh perspective to the ASSU,
who have not been "political" in their past
actions and are not so in their personali
ties, who have a strong sense of right and
wrong, and who are perhaps, even
antipathetic to student government, the
elections and / or the ASSU.

If you've never considered it, we urge
you to apply fora University committee,
to run f<)i office next year — to become
involved in any way you can. If you have
integrity, if you have an interesting per
spective, if you see yourself as an outsider
who will bring something DIFFERENT
to the ASSU, believe us . . . it needs you.

ASSU no longer worthy of students' trust
Liu/Dudas or Newton/Villegas? The
paramount question on the mind of the
campus. But, it has become clear to me in
the past week that there are far deeper
issues facing next year's senate than that
of its president. Current ASSU president
Mike Levin has backed the PAC slate as
the next logic al step as the current senate
has made the ASSU accountable to the
school, and now it is time to make Stan
ford students accountable to the outside
world — back up a step there Mike.
1, for one, now feel that the ASSU is no
longer an accountable body to anyone.
I he one thing that this election has taught
me is that the .ASSU makes no sense, has
no clear organization and deserves very
little faith. How can a body become social
ly conscious when it can't even engage in a
simple election?
Before it can affect the outside world, or
our own campus, the ASSU has to appear
as a trustworthy body. If trusting is believ
ing in a system of demerits that is ill-de
fined, unfathomable, contains no conse
quences and doesn't even appear on the
ballot, then I'm all for that.
Maybe it's true that constitutional rules
needed support from the graduate senate,
but who cares? How can anyone say the
Graduate Student Council in any way rep
resents their student population when it
can't even get enough candidates to (ill its
spots? Eleven out of 6,000, hmnim. If any
graduate students (except you lucky 11)
are actually reading this, prove me wrong,
but graduates couldn't care less about any
thing except better housing and their re
search. Even if the items in question are
rules in the constitution of Zimbabwe, I

still don't want people representing my
voice breaking them.
Ihis election lias lost all scope of what
the ASSU is really about: giving a voice to
the students. Whether that is a socially
conscious voice or one that works toward a
student union is inconsequential. Right
now, I'm sure both slates would scrap all
their ideals if it meant getting elected, and
that strikes me as ridiculous.
rhe ASSU helps everyone, and the
slander, lies, contusion and complete lack
of cooperation must be ended before any
thing is to be done. The runoff is a perfect
example. It was a chance to foster a real
political discussion amongst students and
has degenerated into name-calling and
confusion worthy of any fifth-grade recess.
Good luck next year to the winner. You're
going to need it if you want me to believe
in the ASSU again. To the losers, congrat
ulations: You got the better end of the
deal.

Rhetoric surrounding Elian
typical and skewed
Unfortunately, the "moral and intellec
tual guidance" that Jason Rheins ("A new
view on Elian Gonzalez," letter to the edi

tor, April 27) deems "legitimate" is reflec
tive of the same flag-waving rhetoric that
characterized the McCarthy Era. He al
leges that Elian Clou/ale/ will he put under
direct control of Fidel Castro, and that
| uan Gonzalez's absence of love for Elian is
exemplified by his willingness to sell him
into slavery. Rheins' comments are both
contradictory and audacious.
According to Rheins, Elian will sufler a
Cuban education with textbooks that are
"more propaganda than fact." Of course,
never have American children been de
nied a factual account of history. I, for ex
ample, have been learning since kinder
garten that Christopher Columbus was a
savior, and that the only things worthy of
textbook publication were feats accom
plished by white, right-handed, straight
Christian males. All, the land of the free!
Thank goodness my classmates and I were
not subjected to the "brainwashing" that
poor Elian might face!
Instead of taking quizzes about the evils
of communism, maybe my World Civiliza
tions teachers could have divulged some of
the skeletons. Why is it that 1 didn't learn
about Japanese internment — the locking
up of a country's OWN CITIZENS —
until I was a senior in high school (and
then only from my sister!)?
Why has our embargo on Cuba been
rationalized to me as being because of its
egregious human rights violations, even

though many respected human lights or
ganizations have not accused Cuba of the
kinds of crimes in other countries with
which the United States carries preferen
tial relations? Most likely because the old
reason that said Cuba was a threat to na
tional security is absurd.
What about all of the third world coun
tries in which the United Suites, in its quest
to spread the word of freedom (read: cap
italism), has participated in such acts of
genocide, torture and general havoc
wreaking (not to mention sweatshops)?
Why didn't my textbooks tell me that the
United States' embargo on Cuba bans it
from buying nearly half of new world class
drugs on the market, as well as foreign
medicines or equipment with U.S. compo
nents?
I will be completely honest; given the
c hoice, I too would choose to live in the
United States over Cuba. But I also recog
nize that this is my Americanized point of
view. The idea that "our way is the best
and only way" is the same mindset that
drove colonists to civilize African and Na
tive American "savages." It is also the
mindset that propels homophobia, racism
and general intolerance.
The United States has a long history of
interfering with other forms of govern
ment, specifically communist govern
ments. ostensibly to help them see the light
of capitalist democracy. Rheins does not

have to agree with communism, but to
imply that we have the right to keep Elian
from living in a country that does is quite
presumptuous.
The bottom line is that Juan Miguel
Gonzalez has an inviolable right to his own
son. It is reflective of traditional American
arrogance to believe that we can persecute
him for his political beliefs by robbing him
of Elian.
