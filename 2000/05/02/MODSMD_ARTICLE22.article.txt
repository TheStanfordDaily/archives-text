Elections Commission officers respond to
constitutional charges
I hill the student body is wondering
why the Elections Commission took their
jobs in the first place. You'd have to be
nuts to spend the better part of your
quarter passing up progressives and pub
nights in the name of the ASSU. We
acknowledge this, liut seized by a strange
ethereal impulse to run fair election, we
became impervious to common sense —
for the second year in a row.
We've done our In-st to run a fair elec
tion and are now the brunt of personal
and political angst that has found a happy
outlet in the Constitutional Council.
We have mulled over the following: 1.
I he charges originated from personal
and political spite. 2. We believe the
charges are frivolous. !$. The Constitu
tional Council has refused to answer the
majority of our requests to clarity the
charges. 4. The Constitutional Council
has informed us that the "rights of the
accused" do not apply to us — which
means we won't necessarily be allowed to
talk at the meeting, offer a rebuttal or call
witnesses on our behalf. 5. Despite
alleged bias against us. the (louncil's chair
has refused to recuse himself.
Bluntly, we're not taking the bait any
more. We won't be dignifying the Coun
cil meeting with nervous deferential pres
ence, nor will we be submitting neatly
typed double-spaced arguments 72 hours

iii advance. We're done playing games.
We're taking our ball and going home.
1 he Constitutional Council does not
have the power to burn us at the stake,
tar and feather us or even give us firm
noogies. The most they can do is call a
new election. Civen that the charges are
frivolous and that the acts in question
apparently had no effect on voters, would
it really be wise to do this? Would the
Association applaud another week of
nasty e-mails and neon fliers? Not bloody
likely. We certainly wouldn't —and Elec
tions Commission members don't exactly
grow on trees.
This letter has a second purpose as
well. We began these jobs apolitically and
have remained that way. Our stints on
the Elections Commission have given us
some insight on the ASSIJ, and elections
in particular. We submit the following
modest revelation: If you are a student
who's never had a desire to be part of stu
dent government, you should really give
it some thought.
I he ASSU is richly diverse in some
ways and much less so in others. More
than anything, it could benefit from the
involvement of some individuals who will
bring a fresh perspective to the ASSU,
who have not been "political" in their past
actions and are not so in their personali
ties, who have a strong sense of right and
wrong, and who are perhaps, even
antipathetic to student government, the
elections and / or the ASSU.

If you've never considered it, we urge
you to apply fora University committee,
to run f<)i office next year — to become
involved in any way you can. If you have
integrity, if you have an interesting per
spective, if you see yourself as an outsider
who will bring something DIFFERENT
to the ASSU, believe us . . . it needs you.

ASSU no longer worthy of students' trust
Liu/Dudas or Newton/Villegas? The
paramount question on the mind of the
campus. But, it has become clear to me in
the past week that there are far deeper
issues facing next year's senate than that
of its president. Current ASSU president
Mike Levin has backed the PAC slate as
the next logic al step as the current senate
has made the ASSU accountable to the
school, and now it is time to make Stan
ford students accountable to the outside
