### MAUREEN MULLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
\\ I it'll all is said and d< >ne, it was a good weekend on
the road for the I lth-ranked Stanford Softball team
(39-14, .>-10 Paula 10 Conference). With a stunning
tenth-inning defeat of No. 3 LCLA (33-8-1, 8-4) and
two dose losses to t<>p-rankecl W ashington (50-5, 12-2)
the ( .ardinal showed that it can stay with anybody.
I rida\ s 2-1 victory against the Bruins was twice as
sweet, as it ended a nine-game Cardinal losing streak.
"It was so much Inn to beat LCLA at LCIA," said
freshman pitc her Dana Sorensc>n. "They are a team we
always want to beat, regardless. It was nice to pull
through .md win it in the end."
Both Stanford and UCLA were held scoreless
throughout the first nine innings, as Sorenson and
Bruin pitcher Amanda Freed dueled it out at the plate.
The pair shared Pac-10 pitching honors last week.
Finally in the tenth inning, implementation of inter
national tiebreaker rules that place a runner on second
at the start of the inning ignited some Cardinal offense.
Senior Kellie Wiginton started on second and ad
vanced to third after base-on halls by junior |enni
Shideler. Freshman ('assi Brangham advanced to first
on a catcher interference call, loading the bases for the
('.ardinal.
Senior Lauren Cellman drew the walk to score the
first Cardinal run, bringing in Wiginton. Abase hit by
sophomore Robin Walker brought in Shideler fora
second (Cardinal run scored. (iellman was tagged out as
she wavered between second and third, ending the in
ning for the Stanford.
I CIA notched one run in the bottom (if the tenth,
when Julie Marshall hit a single to drive in Lindsey
kleine from second; however the Bruins were unable
able to score again, handing the victor) to the Cardinal.
"I really have to hand it to the girls," said head coach
John Rittman. "It was a long day but they stuck with it
and came up with the victory in the end."
Alter the jaunt to Los Angeles, the team jetted up to
the Northwest for two games against Washington Sat
urday and Sunday. Saturday's game ended in an 8-0
1 luskies victory as the (Cardinal fell apart in the sixth in
ning. Stanford rebounded on Sunday, narrowly losing
the second game of the series just 1-0.
"It was really just one bad inning on Saturday and
one bad play on Sunday," Sorenson said. "For the most
part we were right there with the No. 1 team in the
country. W'e are so close; we just have one last step."
Saturday's game was even-keeled throughout the
first six innings. However, freshman pitcher Maureen
LeCocq was beginning to get tired. After walking
Washington's Jen Spediacci, LeCoc q was replaced at
the mound by freshman Jamie Forman-Lau.
A series of Cardinal errors on which the Huskies
were able to capitalize ended in an eight-run disaster
lor the Stanford. The Huskies' Spediacci highlighted
the inning for Washington, hitting a homer with two
runners on base.
"8-0 is not at all indicative of Saturday's score,"
Rittman said. "They only hit the ball really hard twice,
and one of those unfortunately happened to be a three
run homer."
I lowever, despite the disappointing loss on Satur
day, the (.ardin.il came back to keep it close on Sunday.
In the second inning, two (Cardinal defensive errors
on a lead-oildouble by Washington's Jenny lopping
