I akeone I'ac-lOClliampion football team,subtrac I
the best receiver in school history, a two-year startei
at quarterback and other contributors at kcv positions
on the offensive line and in the secondary. What do
y < >i i get ?
A\ er\ interesting spring, at least for Stanlbrd head
coach I \ rone Willingham.
I he Stanford lootball team concluded spring
practice on Saturday with the Cardinal and White
scrimmage, but the game didn't prov ide many obvi
ous answers to the tough questions Willingham and
bis coaching staff face for next year.
"('.oming in, we had some holes we needed to fill. I
think in some areas we're mov ing c loser, and I think
we provided some of the voting guvs experience, as in
game-type situations," Willingham said after the
game, which the White team won 15-0. "Did we take
a step in the right direction? Yes. Are we there vet?
Absolutely not."
Most of the buz/ surrounding the game Saturday
concerned the future of junior quarterback Joe Bor
chard, who pulled double duty bv playing the first
half of the scrimmage as the Cardinal OB before

heading over to Sunken Diamond
to.take his spot in right field for the
baseball team.
After the baseball season, Bor
chard is likely to be a high pick in
tin' baseball draft, which means lie
must make a i hoice between sign
ing to pla\ baseball or returning to
school in the fall to play quarter
back, where Ivrone Willingham
said he is the starter at the mo
ment. I'layers in Bom hard's situa
tion before him — including |olm
Klwav — have signed deals that al
lowed them to return to school
altei pla\ing pro ball in the sum
mer, but the junior isn't revealing
am thing yet.
"It's tough to think about that
i iglit now, because I'm in the mid
dle ola baseball season, and I
don't know what the options are
going to be at that point. I would
imagine once tail rolls around, Ill
want to be out there on the loot
ball field," Bon hard said alter Sat
urdays baseball game. "I feel like
I have a lot ol potential .is a quar
terback. ObviousK I'm very nil
proven, though; but the la( t that I
don't have .1 lot ol experience is
going to make ii vcr\ hat (I to walk
away."
Should Borchard leave school,
the likeK starter at QB would be
junior Kand\ lasani, who looked
the best out ol the three quarter
bat ks — including Ireshman (ihris
Lewis — during the scrimmage,
fasani completed 0-01-lIJ passes
loi 107 vards. including a beautiful
111-yard pass to sophomore receiv
er I .like Powell, and scored on a I -
vard QB sneak to cap an 80-yard
drive.
"What the coaches keep on
si 1 essingis consistency .. . I think I
proved to them this spring that I
can be the consistent quarterback
that the\ want," said Fasani. "It's
in.) time to pla\ quarierbac k . . . I
want to show niv skills.''

Rcgiii dlcss of whoevei ends up
playing at quarterback, the com-
I )etit ion to be (alt liing tlk>se I).ills is
going to be w ide open. Deßonnie
I'itts, who returns for his fifth sea
son after starling the past two, is a
proven commodity on the field
and will be the number one receiv
ei without a doubt. Alter him,

however, a large group exists look
ing to grab the othei stai ting slot.
Seniors Kddie (iayles and
|amien McCallum, juniors R\;ui
Wells and Caleb Bowman, and
Powell are all in the mix, although
none particularly distinguished
themselves during the game.
Among those w ho did stand out

at other positions were senior An
thony (labriel, who looks read\ to
step in at linebat ker and showed a
real nose lor getting to the ballcar
rier. Redshirt freslnnan Justin
I'anst showed excellent speed to
the outside from tailback while also
demonstrating he can get the
tough yards at the end.
