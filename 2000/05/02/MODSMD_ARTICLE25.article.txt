Sophomore Caroline Osterwise (#23) faces a double-team in a game earlier this season. Cal used similar tactics to
try to contain Osterwise in this weekend's playoff game.
At the mid-point of the first half,
(ial retaliated with two quick break
away goals that got past freshman
goalkeeper Rachael Neumann.
They were the only balls that were
not saved b\ Neumann during the
first half.
With the game tied 2-2, Stanford
increased the intensity of its offen
sive (attics and stored two more
goals fora half-time lead of 4-2.
"As each situation in the game
presented itself, they reacted and
played it just right. All the things
that we have been working to cor
rect in practice went perfectlv,"
(lonnor said.
()ne of the biggest obstacles that
Stanford faced Saturday was adjust
ing to C lal's aggressive double-team
ing of Caroline Osterwise. After
four goals in last week's game, Cal
was intent to shut her out. Despite
their efforts, ( )sterwise continued to
be an offensive leader and scored
one of Stanford's goals during the
first half.
"Because we played Cal so re
cently, they were alread\ prepared
for many of our offensive plavs. ()ur
offense did a great job changing
their tactics and executing the
goals," senior co-captain Rachel
(lallagher said.
Slid i was the case (< >r s( >plu)inc>re
Sara Lev, who turned up the heat
against Cal's defense bv scoring
Stanford's filth and sixth goals din -
ing the second half. (lal'soflense re
sponded b\ scoring two goals ol its
own, bringing the score to (i-4.
"Although we felt confident in
our lead throughout the game,
there never seemed to be such a
wide margin that we could let down
oui guard or slow down the tempo.
We fought hard from beginning to
end," (iallagher said.
Defensivelv. Rachael Neumann
was one of the kevs to Stanford's
success. She allowed onl\ two of
C lal's shots to get In her during the

second half , and (ionnor comment
ed that every clear was right on the
mark. She saved every one of C.al s
eight-meter penalty shots and was
generally "unbeatable," according
to Connor.
Neumann's defense team was
led by senior co-captain Christina
(iilvutin who wasa tactical and emo
tion leader in the backfield. She led
the team in ground balls and forced
ke\ turnovers that contributed to
Stanford's offensive domination.
Sophomores Kmily Rodriguez,
Jenny Silverman and I'atti Zettler
were also instrumental as they shut
down Cal's ke\ players and held
them to only three goals.
With a score of (i-4, freshman at
tack Li/ Lanese linali/cd the win
with the Cardinal's last goal of the
game, ending the playoffs with a 7-
4 victory.
"Our win was all about putting
everything together. Ii was the first
time this season that we played a full
sixtv minutes without ever drop
ping our intensity and focus. We
had 100-percent effort from every
player on the field," Briti said.
I he team now looks toward
San Diego and to its single week of
preparation. It will continue to
work on offensive plays and transi
tioning the ball from the defensive
through the midfield, tactics
which have been extremely suc
cessful in the past two weeks of
competition.
T he Cardinal has won the
WW LI. ('.hampionship lor the past
two years, but the task that still lies
ahead is l>\ no means an easy one.
In the first round, Stanford will
pla\ I CI .A. which enters the tour
nament as the No. I team from the
south division.
"Last year we played I CL\ in
the semifinals and cruised to a vic
tory. I'hev have a new coach this
year and a new attitude, so we'll
continue to locus on dominating
the game and controlling the
tempo," (lon nor said. "If we can get
past I CIA. we may take on Davis
in the Final — but we'll take one
game at a time.
