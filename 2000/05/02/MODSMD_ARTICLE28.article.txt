"What are we going to do to make
sure there is more access to demo
graphic groups that are excluded and
underrepresented in technology, espe
cially the Internet, and include them to
benefit from the Economic fruits that
the Digital Age promises?" junior Sean
Mcintosh, asked a crowd of students
attending yesterday's discussion panel
on the "Digital Divide" in Ujamaa
Lounge.
In conjunction with the Black Stu
dent Union's "Reality Check 2000 Se
ries," Mclnt.osli,.jhe program coordi
nwm&wmr. introduced speakers
from Plugged In, a technology access
center in East Palo Alto, and the Rain
how PUSH Coalition, a national orga
nization dedicated to social change, to
speak about ways for Stanford students
to become involved in combatting the
digital divide.
"The digital divide is the technology
gap that exists between wealthy and low
income individuals, but also extends to
the technology gap in racial and ethnic
ity classifications," Mcintosh explained.
Senior Kevin Wilson, a representa
tive from the EPA office of the Rainbow
PUSH Coalition, asked students to con
sider the historical sources of the cur
rent technological disparity.
"What we've got to keep in mind is:
'Why is there a digital divide?' It brings
to the forefront other deep structural
divides that have been present in our so
ciety for so long," said Wilson.
According to the National Telecom
munications and Informations Adminis
tration, "The digital divide between
whites and most minorities continues to
grow. There are signs, however, that
higher incomes are helping to narrow
and could eventually close the gap."
Mcintosh emphasized the far-reach
ing implications of the digital divide.
"In terms of technology, it not only
means Internet access, but also means
ownership of telephones, computers,
cellular phones, microwave ovens, etc,
he said.
Senior Jamal Wat kins, Co-chair of the

BSU, asked students to consider "those
privileges and access opportunities that
we take for granted every day, even
things like e-mail."
"This issue runs deeper in our com
munity than even we usually realize," he
said. "It also deals with economic em
powerment, with how governments
work with disadvantaged communities."
Armando Arroyo, the director of
Plugged In, explained some obstacles of
the digital divide which he lias encoun
tered in his work in EPA.
"Why don't candidates for mayor in
EPA even have an e-mail account so I
can e-mail my concerns about the elec
tion?" he asked.
Even after President Clinton's high
profile visit to the center, Arroyo ex
plained that Plugged In is not govern
mentally funded.
He said that the center is dependent
upon private donations and volunteer
instructors for its operation.
Senior Vanessa Fleming, the art di
rector for Plugged In, discussed the cen
ter's three-pronged focus on "access, ed
ucation and entrepi eneiu ialship."
She emphasized the "need in the
community to provide access to both
technology and instruction."
Plugged In, which opened in 1992,
provides an access center with comput
er, photocopy and fax facilities, teen
programs in web and graphic design
and children's programs which inte
grate creative arts and technology.
Wilson also stressed the importance
of coalition building to effectively con
front the challenges of the digital divide.
He said he hoped that PUSH might
become "that network that's going to
combine all these efforts to make a
greater impact."
Several students called for Stanford
to become a leader in both social and
technological innovation.
"Stanford has the obligation to be
synonymous with social benefits of tech
nology just as it has been synonymous
with the economic benefits of technolo
gy," said Wilson.
"Stanford has been at the center of
Silicon Valley as an entrepreneurial suc
cess," said senior Joel Difron. "We
should also be at the forefront con
fronting the digital divide."
Past discussion topics addressed by
the "Reality Check 2000 Series" include
civil rights law and politics and public
education.
