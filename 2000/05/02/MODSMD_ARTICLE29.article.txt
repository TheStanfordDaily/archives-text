Anyone who has ever accessed the Stan
ford Internet or diet ked iheir mail at Stan
lord has used the dedicated Solaris servers
or SPAR('.stations at Sweet Hall. As my girl
friend could tell vou, m\ life wouldn't have
been the same without /write and the Java
hierarchy. Gates, schmates — Sun is at the
heart of the computer revolution.
Sun, originalh the Stanford University
Network, has ridden to the top of the com
puting world on the hack of its operating slo
gan, "the Network is the Computer'
Sun's path to the top of the computing world
is a pretty typical one, at least iu the age of
the Internet.
Sun started with only four members in
19812. Among them were two current execu
tives: (ihairman, CE() and (Graduate School
of Business graduate Scott McNealy and
Chief Scientist Bill Joy. McNealy is now one
of the top corporate speakers in America. I le
is widelv Regarded as not only one of the
smartest businessmen in America, but also
one of the most personable.
Joy went to Berkeley. I le is also one of top
minds in the computing industry. In the late
19705, he was the principal engineer of BSD,
Berkeley I Nl\. which sparked the open

source revolution. Joy followed up his
UNIX success with the 1995 release of Java
at Sun.
I'he significant brain trust at Sun quickly
translated into profits. In 1984 a technology
for network file sharing, NFS, was intro
duced free to the industry. In 1986, Sun had
its initial public offering. The products re
leased in the 1980s put Sun in position to be
a key player when the Internet revolution
struck in the 19905.
Sun's most popular product undoubtedly
is Java. While many programmers use Java
lor the caffeine content, still more use Java
for its extreme portability and ease of use.
I he Java programming language is unique
because it can run on any platform. If a stu
dent drags his Java program from his PC
over to the UNIX stations in Sweet I lall, it'll
still work. UnlikeCand C+ + , which require
careful memory management, Java takes
care of it for you.
Java's most recent release of the Java plat
form, Java 2 Platform Knterprise Edition, in
cludes many Internet-centric toys that allow
big companies to have fun on their Websites.
Ever voted on ESPN.com before it was disal
lowed due to the mascot scandal? Java ap
plet. Ever used Dialpad to place a free phone
call? Also a Java applet, avail
able on J 2 EE.
Ilie new Java platform also
prides itself on being scaleable.
Hundreds of people hit your
site at once? No problemo.
So where's Sun's future?
Five years ago Sun executives
predicted the future of Sun
would lie in the Internet, band
with and network services, ac
cording lo Ed Zander, presi
dent and chief Operating offi
cer, on the Sun Web site.
What's in store for the next
five years? Scalability, "continu
ous real-time computing'' and
"the integrated stack." By con
tinuous real-time computing,
Zander is referring to being
constantly connected to the In
ternet through wireless and op
tical networks. Businesses can
no longer risk downtime, so re
sponsiveness is going to have to
happen instantly. I he integrat
ed stack refers to seamlessly in
tegrating the different hard
ware and software layers.
Ihe benefits of scalability
can be seen in the new Java
platform. I he other two?
They're more prevalent in
what Sun hopes will be the Java
of the future,Jini (pronouced,
"geenie").
II the future pans out the
way Sun envisions it, their new
product will do to Christina
Aguilera what Java did to Juan
Valdez. When programmers
think Java, they no longer
think Columbian coffee beans
but rather portability. In the fu
111re, when programmers think
|ini, they will no longer think
"You've got to rub it the right
way," but rather interclevice
networking.
Jini is founded on the feel
ing that networks should just
run together, without the ex
cesses ol drivers and cables and
connectors. Jini is attempting

to do for hardware what Java
did for software — make it
more user friendly. 1 he vision
of 1 ini is to allow all portable
devices, such as mobile phones,
televisions, radios, PCs, lap
tops, etc. to be strung together
into one network. Not only
could they be connected, but
they could run together on the
fly. Uh, I want to join so and so
network. Done. Came over.
How does it work? The de
vices all have services to offer.
These services are listed on the
Network. If a device wants to
join the network, it runs the
discovery and join protocol
where it locates a central
lookup service on the network
and adds itself . The lookup ser
vice contains all the services on
the network. The Jini network
runs on an operating layer over
Java technologies, which pro
vide the means by which the
network is secured. Ihe
lookup service and the discov
ery and joint service are really
just Java objects.
Willi ;ill these new technolo
gies all over the place, how
much longer is it until comput
ers and robots take over the
world? Until now, that was ;t
question that was only asked by
science fiction buffs. Hut in a re
cent statement published In
Wired Magazine, Joy himself
proposed such a theory. He
furthered this theory to a
packed lecture room at Stan
ford University in a talk enti
tled "Will Spiritual Robots Re
place 1 lumanity by 2100?".
For the last 17 years, Sun has
sustained its position at the cut
ting edge of computing. Willi
Java the standard program
ming language of software and
the Internet and the promising
Jini technology beckoning on
the horizon, Sun should be
prominently positioned in the
networking arena for quite a
while. And with its concentra
tion on open-source platforms,
anyone can take part in helping
them along.
