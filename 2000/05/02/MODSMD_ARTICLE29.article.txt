Anyone who has ever accessed the Stan
ford Internet or diet ked iheir mail at Stan
lord has used the dedicated Solaris servers
or SPAR('.stations at Sweet Hall. As my girl
friend could tell vou, m\ life wouldn't have
been the same without /write and the Java
hierarchy. Gates, schmates â€” Sun is at the
heart of the computer revolution.
Sun, originalh the Stanford University
Network, has ridden to the top of the com
puting world on the hack of its operating slo
gan, "the Network is the Computer'
Sun's path to the top of the computing world
is a pretty typical one, at least iu the age of
the Internet.
Sun started with only four members in
19812. Among them were two current execu
tives: (ihairman, CE() and (Graduate School
of Business graduate Scott McNealy and
Chief Scientist Bill Joy. McNealy is now one
of the top corporate speakers in America. I le
is widelv Regarded as not only one of the
smartest businessmen in America, but also
one of the most personable.
Joy went to Berkeley. I le is also one of top
minds in the computing industry. In the late
19705, he was the principal engineer of BSD,
Berkeley I Nl\. which sparked the open

source revolution. Joy followed up his
UNIX success with the 1995 release of Java
at Sun.
I'he significant brain trust at Sun quickly
translated into profits. In 1984 a technology
for network file sharing, NFS, was intro
duced free to the industry. In 1986, Sun had
its initial public offering. The products re
leased in the 1980s put Sun in position to be
a key player when the Internet revolution
struck in the 19905.
Sun's most popular product undoubtedly
is Java. While many programmers use Java
lor the caffeine content, still more use Java
for its extreme portability and ease of use.
I he Java programming language is unique
because it can run on any platform. If a stu
dent drags his Java program from his PC
over to the UNIX stations in Sweet I lall, it'll
still work. UnlikeCand C+ + , which require
careful memory management, Java takes
care of it for you.
Java's most recent release of the Java plat
form, Java 2 Platform Knterprise Edition, in
cludes many Internet-centric toys that allow
big companies to have fun on their Websites.
