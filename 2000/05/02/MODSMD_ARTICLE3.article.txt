Palo Alto residents voted in March to repeal the
c ity's temporary historic preservation law, which gov
erns the renovation and demolition of'houses deemed
historic. 1 lie C lity (Council will now work to draft a new
law to replace an outdated 1979 statute.
According to Stanford Director of Community Re
lations Andy Coe, Palo Alto's preservation laws do not
affect Stanford. All University-owned faculty housing
is located outside Palo Alto c ity limits in Santa C.lara
County.
However, for Palo Alto residents, these laws can
have a great effect on home values. Any law the coun
cil passes must balance the interests of property-rights
advocates and historic preservation groups, both of
which waged a bitter campaign over this spring's ref
erendum.
Property rights advocates support fewer restric
tions on remodeling or demolishing old houses in a
city where the price of a vacant acre can reach $5 mil
lion.
1 fistoric preservation groups support more restric
tions to preserve unique, older homes and prevent
them 112 rom being torn down in favor of newer, larger
