Palo Alto residents voted in March to repeal the

erns the renovation and demolition of'houses deemed
historic. 1 lie C lity (Council will now work to draft a new
law to replace an outdated 1979 statute.
According to Stanford Director of Community Re
lations Andy Coe, Palo Alto's preservation laws do not
affect Stanford. All University-owned faculty housing
is located outside Palo Alto c ity limits in Santa C.lara
County.
However, for Palo Alto residents, these laws can
have a great effect on home values. Any law the coun
cil passes must balance the interests of property-rights
advocates and historic preservation groups, both of
which waged a bitter campaign over this spring's ref
erendum.

A "vote no on [proposition] G" sign stands in front of a
Palo Alto house. Historical preservation laws have
caused some controversy in Palo Alto, though they have
had little effect on Stanford.
structures.
The city crafted tlx* temporary historic
preservation ordinance in 1 998 to replace
an aging 1979 statute. It regulated about
700 homes, as compared to 200 in the old
law. This figure was a compromise from a
list that originally included about 3,000
houses.
Public opposition to the law culminated
in a drive this spring to repeal the tempo
rary ordinance, flic City Council unani
mously affirmed the voters' decision on
April 24 and will finalize its decision on
May 8.
Under the 1979 law, the city can delay
demolition of a house termed "historic" for
a year and can require that the I listoric Re

sources Board review exterior renovations.
It cannot legally prevent the homeowner
from demolishing the house.
The 1998 law, in contrast, restricted the
demolishing and remodeling of homes
deemed as historic under a 1979 survey
and a recent survey by the architecture
consulting firm of Dames and Moore.
The new plan will probably include tax
breaks, free advice and other incentives to
encourage people to maintain their older
homes, according to Palo Alto Planning Di
rector Kd Cawf. He saitl in the Palo Alto
Weekly that the program will recognize
that older homes can be more expensive
and challenging to maintain.
The city lias proposed that $150,000 be
used tor historic preservation in the 2000-
01 budget. It has also hired Dennis Back
lund, an expert on local historic land
marks, as a special consultant tor the pro
gram.

Some residents support mandatory re
strictions because of the pressure to maxi
mize value in Palo Alto's real estate market.
"In six months or a year, you're going to
see properties disappear," said resident
Bob Moss in the Palo Alto Weekly.
Property rights advocates argue that
any prohibition, such as the mandate that
protected homes built before 1940 from
demolition, is too restrictive and unfair to
property owners.
"Depending on the definition, I'm for"
preservation, said Aldo Daßosa, professor
emeritus of electrical engineering and a
Palo Alto resident. "If the definition is too
broad, I'm not."
Daßosa indicated that houses dating
from before 1940 should not necessarily be
included in historic preservation ordi
nances, as under the former law. He owns
two homes in Palo Alto, one built around
1940 and one built after then.
