## Sun CEO McNealy talks success: 'Stick with the really smart people' 
### 
Folks frequently approach me
for career advice. They often
assume that because I run a
large network-computing compa
ny, 1 will immediately outline some
formula for success that includes
joining secret societies and learn
ing alpha-male body language.
Instead, 1 give them a one-line
response: Stick with the really
smart people.
I've been lucky. I've always en
joyed the really smart people.
I hey open my mind to new possi
bilities, force me to consider un
comfortable visions of the future
and get me thinking about far-out
stuff. Over the past 18 years or so,
surrounding myself with these
folks has helped me immensely as
chief executive officer of Sun Mi
crosystems. It has been instrumen
tal as Sun invented Java 1 and
|ini' technologies, led the way in
the Internet-infrastructure build
ing boom and unveiled products
that are now standards in the dot
com world.
These days, the smart people
aren't necessarily the ones who
look like complete geeks. A lot of
them have pierced foreheads or
pink Mohawks or tattoos of Klvis
on their necks. Others look like
Grizzly Adams, and you'll see them
doing tai chi in the hallways or try
ing to attach giant solar panels to
their bikes in the parking lot. They
aren't afraid to look different or
think in new ways. I was telling
market analysts the other day, you
gotta have these people on your
payroll if you want to run a compa
ny that breaks the rules and invents

killer technologies. I may not ask
them to baby-sit my kids, but I do
want them at Sun's development
labs, inside our "Web caves" and at
tending our marketing meetings. 1
want to walk past a conference
room and see some guy with a
giant beard, plenty ofbody art and
dark sunglasses scaring the tar out
of our employees with new con
cepts in business and computing.
From time to time, a company
needs to get slapped across the face
b\ new thinkers with wild ideas.

One of the great things about
hiring and retaining the smartest
people is that they attract more
smart people. This not only enrich
es the working environment tor
everyonu, but i.l, allows me to send
some of them oil to invent the next
great thing. We've actually secured
a place in the (lolorado mountains
where some of these folks go to tin
ker with ideas. Others head oil to
our labs and campuses, where they
develop new paradigms with other
really smart people.

I've found thai many of the very
brightest run on a mental motor
quite dillerent from others. Con
sider Bill Joy, a Sun co-founder
and our chief scientist. The man is
often referred to as the "Edison of
the Internet," and he is credited
wit h helping create some of the top
networking technologies on the
planet. Like a kid at the circus, I'll
watch as he and his colleagues dive
into the creative details of what will
be the next big technology — and
do it not only in warp speed but at
a refreshing level of clarity and sim
plicity.
Working with people like Joy
indeed leaves a lot of very bright
people feeling a little dazed at
times, but it has allowed Sun to
foresee — and prepare for — some
ol the biggest advents in technolo
gy. And if you think about it, intel
ligence always has allowed people
to do this, whether it's by under
standing the human body better,
deciphering weather patterns, or
studying stars in the sky.
At Sun, very intelligent people
such as joy, who can see the future,
have helped us establish strategies
that seem crazy at first but brilliant
a few years later. Nearly 20 years
before almost anyone else, Joy
knew that the world would be built
around the Internet. Ten years
ago, we were talking about the de
emphasis of PCs, the future emer
gence of thin clients and our belief
that "The Network Is The Com
puter ' M." More than a few critics
thought we'd lost our marbles, but
now they are watching as all these
predictions come true. You can't
go anywhere without hearing pun
dits confirm that the Net and a pro
liferation of connecting appliances



SCOn McNEALY
indeed replaced the I'C as the in
dustry growth drivers.
These days, Sun is talking
about the advent of free software
and appliances. A lot of people
just can't fathom such a world.
But believe me, soon you won't
have to pay for most software,
just as you don't pay for the soft
ware in your telephone — all you
pay is a monthly service fee. I he
Internet will continue to move
toward the service-driven 111iIit\
model, which means that shrink
wrapped software is out. simplic
ity of use is in, and companies
that can't adjust are mortally
wounded.
All of which makes it critic al to
recognize the companies with the
right collection of bright people.
I his is why 1 tell college grads
that they should practice a
healthy skepticism when looking
Ol companies that only acquire
technologies but never create
them. Job-seekers should seek
Lhe companies that create intel
lectual property, introduce
breakthrough concepts and en
courage research and invest
ment. If they're successful, the)
may just end up enjoying a won
drous glimpse into the future.
