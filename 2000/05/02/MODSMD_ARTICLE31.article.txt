# Neurons: Part Three of a Four-Part Series
## Scientists work to crack the neural code 
### ERIC KEISMAN 
"Your mind has no direct access to the
visual world" insists I'rol. ot Neurobiology
Bill Newsome ot the Medical School. Our
entire visual experience is a sophisticated
reconstruction. Reconstructed, lie says,
from electrical signals that stream towards
the visual cortex in bundles ol neurons,
en route from the 1 etina.
Newsome has spent years trying to
learn how shapes and motion are extract
ed from that cacophony ol neural input.
In the process, he and others like him
have gained insight into how the brain en
codes information, bridging the gap be
tween firing neurons and our subjective
experience of the world.
In this digital age, the idea of encoding
is commonplace. Music on a (.1) is stored
as a string ol ()s and Is. Pop that CD into
your computer, and you can encode the
same music in MP3 format. But, what is
the code that the brain uses to represent
and store information? How can groups
of neurons firing together mean some
thing to your mind.''
I he emerging answer seems to be that
there are neurons in the brain that are
specialized to recognize certain features
of our experience. When these "feature
selective" neurons lire at the same time,
they indicate the presence of some object
that, consists ol all of those features to
gether. Essentially, they are letters in a
neural alphabet that, when put together,
'spell' our experiences in a neural code.
Some of the most detailed examples of
this coding strategy have come from stud
ies of how the visual system processes
what you see and presents it to the rest of

brain. This processing happens in the vi
sual cortex. In the visual cortex, there are
special groups of neurons whose job it is
to watch <1 point in space, called their "re
ceptive field."
"By virtue of the wiring between the
retina and these cells in the cortex, they
seem to be set up to respond to behav
iorally significant events or objects in the

world," says Newsome. I hey are pro
grammed to look for the occurrence of
certain features there, like a line at a par
ticular orientation. When they see it, they
report this by firing a burst ol action po
tentials.
I o imagine how groups of cells like this
might begin to reconstruct the visual
world, consider what happens when you

look at the letter T/ on an eye ( hart, Foi
each ol the four lines that make up this let
ter, there is a cell responsible for monitor
ing that part ol space, and deciding
whether it sees .1 line in its preferred ori
entation. I he way the visual cortex 'spells
K' to the rest ol the brain is b\ the simul
taneous firing of these four < ells.
If you continue this strategy, and put
enough lines together at the right orien
tation, you can construct <1 rough sketch
of the contours that outline a desk, <1 <t< >or,
or even a lac e.
"Somehow, these cells represent a first
level of abstraction in the cerebral cortex
where the neural svstein starts to spec ifi
cally represent the orientation of local
edges" says Newsome. "Probably . . . .
those cells are the fundamental building
blocks of our ability to see and recognize
form and pattern."
The world is made up of more than
just contours and edges. Frequently,
these contours are moving. I low the brain
processes this additional dimension ol the
visual experience lias been the locus ol
Newsoine's own research.
|ust as there are neurons that watch a
particular region of space fin lines or
edges, so there are neurons that motiitoi
that same region ol space for movement.
Fhese cells are sensitive to a particular di
rection of motion across that region ol
space. When they 'see' it, they respond by
firing action potentials. I hese cells aren 1
picky, though. If motion across their re
ceptive field is close to their favorite di
rection. they will lire action potentials,
just not as rapidly.
In order to see all of the possible direc
tions of motion, one might imagine that

you need mam neurons for each region
in space. This is the case, but the number
of neurons can he reduced, because the
cells cooperate to spec ify intermediate di
rections of motion. For instance, if one cell
is sensitive to northward motion and one
cell is sensitive to westward motion, then
motion to the northwest can be encoded,
or 'spelled,' I>\ intermediate activation of
these two neurons at once.
It is one tiling to know that these neu
rons are there and that they fire in re
sponse to certain kinds of stimuli. But
how do we know that the activation of
these neurons is suffh icul to account for
the subjective experience of this stimulus?
Newsome asked,"(lan we demonstrate
that the acti\ it\ of these cells .. . really in
fluences. in this kind of intuitively mean
ingful wax , our subjective perception of
the world?
Ideally, one would like to show that
vou can alter that subjective experience in
a predictable way by fiddling with these
same neurons.
As it turns out. you can.
If motion is represented using combi
nations ol direction-sensitive neurons,
then researchers ought to be able to bias
the motion that is seen by stimulating
neurons that stand for one direction or
another. 1 "his is precisely what happens.
For example, if a subject is shown an ob
ject going north, while the 'west' neuron is
artificially stimulated, the subject will ac
tuallv report seeing motion to the north
west.
Why does the brain bother to create
abstract representations of information


Spelling E' in the Neural Alphabet
A simplified example of how the visual system encodes objects
as the simultaneous activation of 'feature-selective' cells. For
each bar that makes up the 'E' at left, there is a group of cells
[right] responsible for watching that part of space. When these
cells see a bar at their preferred orientation, they fire a burst of
action potentials. The 'code' for 'E' is shown on the right as a
pattern of activated cells [highlighted boxes]. More sophisticated
shapes can be encoded by elaborating on this strategy.
