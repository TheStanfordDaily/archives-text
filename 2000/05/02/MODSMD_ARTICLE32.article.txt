Some things in lift* were just
meant to be together, Cookies and
milk. Ham and eggs. Pepperoni
flavored paste in a dog-food like
crust (do they even SFLL Combos
out on the West Coast?). Science
and the film industry are not two ol
these things — in fact, you could
argue that, it they were people, they
would make regular appearances
on the " Jerry Springer Show."
Filmmakers want excitement to
grip their audience; science is
about as interesting as watching
the White I louse grass grow on ( i-

an alternative to science that fits
