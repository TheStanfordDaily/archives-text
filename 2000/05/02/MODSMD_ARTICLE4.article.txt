### SHANNON MOFFETT 
Palden (iyntso,a I ibetan monkand long-time pris
oner of the (Chinese occupying government of' Tibet,
began 11 is speech last night with a smile that showed his
straight white teeth.
It was only later that his listeners learned the teeth
were false*, ;ts lie removed them, showing a mouth left
completely toothless by an electric torture instrument.
According to Cyatso, a\ ho spoke through an inter
preter to an audience of 80 people, the Chinese "cops"
who ruled the Tibetan prison in which he was incar
cerated foi 33 years moved on to electric probes in
1981.
I his change in policy, he said, was put into effect
after 22 vears of torturing prisoners with less "techno
logical" methods — fire, starvation and whipping,
among others — failed to force many Tibetan prison

ers to renounce the fight lor Tibetan independence
from China. I lie ( hinese army invaded and o< cupied
Tibet in 1949.
In March 0f!959, Gyatso participated in a rally
protesting the C Chinese occupation, during \\ Inch "out
slogan was 'China go back to China, libel is for Ti
betans,' " he said.
Three months later (iyatso, who'd been sludving as
a Tibetan monk from childhood, was attested and
jailed, at the age of 27. 1 le wasn't released un'il August
of 1992, at the age of 59.
(ivatso's speech was sponsored by Stanford in (>ov
ernment.
In introducing Gyatso, SIG member Tauten In
ouye, a sophomore, pointed out that he "is a little bit
different than most of our speakers — he didn't at
tend an Ivy League School and doesn't have an office
in Washington. D.C., but he does have a unique per
spective on the world."
That unique perspective became evident when
Gyatso reached into the silk bag he carried, a soft bag
that matched the red fabric ol his robe, and withdrew
a package that made a liene thump when he set it on
ihc table.
I Ie opened the package to show torture
instruments of the type he says were used
011 him and other Tibetan prisoners —
electric probes in varying sizes and
toothed thumb-cuffs, which apparently
were used not merely to immobilize the
prisoners but to torture them. Their hands
were hound with one arm over their heads
and one jammed behind their backs.
Gyatso also described being forced to
"pull an iron plow, while we were whipped,
treated exactly like animals. Because our
diet was so poor, prisoners often fainted.

then the) would be proclaimed dead, and
their hands and fret were bound and they
were buried. But 1 know many were not
dead. 1 saw a man declared dead return to
consciousness and beg 'please do some
thing,' and we cried, because we couldn't
do anything or we'd be killed."
While he spent much of the night speak
ing of the horrors he'd seen, Ciyatso is more
lonised 011 a mission. "I witnessed thou
sands of people die of starvation, many
right in 112 ront of me," (iyatso said. "They all
asked me: If you survive outside of this jail,
please work for l ibet, to take the legacy out
to the world, the incredible injustice done
to the people of Tibet, to not let others for
get."
Which, it seems, is exactly what Gyatso is
doing — he has written a book, "Autobiog

raphy ofa Tibetan Monk," which he signed
for audience members, and he has been to
over 30 universities spreading the word
about his experiences in Tibet.
His main message was that each person,
even working individually, is capable of
making a difference; he pointed out that
letters from Amnesty International mem
bers were what finally achieved his release
from prison.
And it was Amnesty International of
London that bought Gyatso's new teeth.
When he removed them and held them
up for the audience to sec, Gyatso said
"these symbolize not just to look better or
speak clearly, but they symbolize peace.
There was one power that broke my teeth
and another that cared enough to replace
them."
