## 
### SLONY KAUR 
l he Okada Tea House, used
as a traditional tea house until a
lew years ago, re-opened last
month following substantial ren
ovations.
Several years ago, the (Country
Health Inspector decided that it
was not hygienic enough to serve
food, and it was closed down.
Later, the Tea I louse became
;i place for student groups to
meet, though il remained in
poor condition. The peeling
paint and run-down appearance
made it ail unpopular meeting
place.
I n fall of 1999, junior 1 ini I a .
manager of the Tea House, an
ethinic theme ,issist;ini in Okada
and the community serv ice coor
dinator for Last Wilbur, initiated
efforts to renovate the lea
I louse. ()kada resident assistants
and other students living in the
dorm helped him, and plans for
the renovation have been in the
works since winter quarter.
According to 112 reshman I .ilia
foal, a resident of Junipero and
the lea House Administrator,

students discussed the process
and brainstormed on different
ideas.
According to Lx, the funding
for the renovation came from
Housing and Dining Services
and Residential Education.
" I hey realized the need for
student space," he said.
I he students re-painted the
walls, though the old mural on
the wall was left untouched. Lx
requested that Emiley Chang, a
freshman and a fellow resident of
Okada, create the new mural.
" 1 had never clone a mural be
fore," said Chang, who spent 14
hours creating I he work. "M\ in
spiration came from mx interest
in birds," she said.
Chang said of the mural. "It
has an Asian-American influ
ence. I drew the experiences I
had as a kid â€” images of birds,
cranes, pine trees and plum blos
soms." I he mural has an overall
theme of movement and flight,
causing the flowers to look as il
they are being blown away by I he
breeze.
Chang said, "h has an Asian-
American theme of movement -

of old roots being swept away
and transplanted In new ones;
new beginnings emerging from
old ideas." Ihe moon in the
mural's background is the unify
ing element.
1 he mural was commissioned
at the end of March and was
ready for the opening d.i\ cele
brations held on March L'tt, the
start of spring quarter.
At the opening celebrations,
several student groups were in
vited to a reception, w hie h served
as a wax to publicize the opening
of the renovated building, said
foal. " I he house is a good and
convenient place lot student
groups to meet." she said.
