# Okada Tea House renovated
## 
### SLONY KAUR 
l he Okada Tea House, used
as a traditional tea house until a
lew years ago, re-opened last
month following substantial ren
ovations.
Several years ago, the (Country
Health Inspector decided that it
was not hygienic enough to serve
food, and it was closed down.
Later, the Tea I louse became
;i place for student groups to
meet, though il remained in
poor condition. The peeling
paint and run-down appearance
made it ail unpopular meeting
place.
I n fall of 1999, junior 1 ini I a .
manager of the Tea House, an
ethinic theme ,issist;ini in Okada
and the community serv ice coor
dinator for Last Wilbur, initiated
efforts to renovate the lea
I louse. ()kada resident assistants
and other students living in the
dorm helped him, and plans for
the renovation have been in the
works since winter quarter.
According to 112 reshman I .ilia
foal, a resident of Junipero and
the lea House Administrator,

students discussed the process
and brainstormed on different
ideas.
According to Lx, the funding
for the renovation came from
Housing and Dining Services
and Residential Education.
" I hey realized the need for
student space," he said.
I he students re-painted the
walls, though the old mural on
the wall was left untouched. Lx
requested that Emiley Chang, a
freshman and a fellow resident of
Okada, create the new mural.
" 1 had never clone a mural be
fore," said Chang, who spent 14
hours creating I he work. "M\ in
spiration came from mx interest
in birds," she said.
Chang said of the mural. "It
has an Asian-American influ
ence. I drew the experiences I
had as a kid â€” images of birds,
cranes, pine trees and plum blos
soms." I he mural has an overall
theme of movement and flight,
causing the flowers to look as il
they are being blown away by I he
breeze.
Chang said, "h has an Asian-
American theme of movement -

of old roots being swept away
and transplanted In new ones;
new beginnings emerging from
old ideas." Ihe moon in the
mural's background is the unify
ing element.
1 he mural was commissioned
at the end of March and was
ready for the opening d.i\ cele
brations held on March L'tt, the
start of spring quarter.
At the opening celebrations,
several student groups were in
vited to a reception, w hie h served
as a wax to publicize the opening
of the renovated building, said
foal. " I he house is a good and
convenient place lot student
groups to meet." she said.
file lea House is booked in
advance, and first priority is
given to Wilbur communitx ser
x ice groups and the Asian-Amer
ican student groups. Second pi i
oiii\ is given to othei communi
tx service groups, and finallx. to
other educational programming

recreational facilities or kitchens avail
able, but groups may bring their own
refreshments.
According to Toal, there has not
been an increase in the number of stu
dent groups seeking to use the lea
House. "One reason is that most stu
dent groups are already locked in their
previous meeting places, as the renova
tion comes in the middle ot the acade
mic year," said Toal. "Perhaps more
groups will start availing of the facility
from next year."
She also felt that probably student
groups did not know enough about the
lea House. "We can start publicizing it
by talking to the groups who are eligi
ble for using it. I want to link it to the
Stanford Community Carnival," she

said, but the idea is still in its inception.
Student groups who have used the
facility were not as enthusiastic about
the renovations.
A cappella group Mixed Company
has used the Teahouse. Yum Vo, busi
ness manager for the group said, "li is
nice to use the space, but it is not very
well maintained. It is dusty and un
clean...not very inviting and poorly
ventilated. The new paint is still bad
and should be re-done."
He said that their group had used
the facility only once after the renova
tion, but "was disappointed with it.
They could have done a better job."
Ly said that as of now only about half
of the Tea I louse is completely renovat
ed. By the beginning of next year the
second half should have carpet in place,
and the entire space will have drapes.
"Half of it looks really nice now, and the
rest should be totally done by the new
school year," he said.
