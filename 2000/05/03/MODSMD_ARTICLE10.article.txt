Palo Alto bans fireplaces
PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) — Big, expensive new homes
in Palo Alto may soon Ix* delivered with every amenity
available except for one — no standard-model wood
burning fireplaces.
On Monday, the city became the fourth in the Bay
Area to ban a common type of wood-burning fireplace in
all new residential and commercial construction. 1 fome
owners still have the option of natural gas fireplaces or
wood-burning fireplaces that have Environmental Pro
tection Agency approval.
What future residents are not allowed to have are so
called "fireboxes" which cost around 300 dollars and, ac
cording to air quality officials, are inefficient and polluting.
Los Gatos, Dublin and Petaluma are the other cities
with such a fireplace ban. San Jose, Berkeley and Contra
Costa County are considering similar edicts.
The ban is set to take effect on June 30.

Female coaches few and
far between in college
There has never been a better time to be a female ath
lete in college sports, but women apparently believe that
there has never been a worse time to be a coach. Accord
ing to a new study, fewer women, on a percentage basis,
are coaching women's teams now than at any point in the
past 23 years.
Women represent only 45.6 percent of the coaches of
women's teams in the National Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion in 2000, according to the latest edition of a longitudi
nal study by R. Vivian Acosta and Linda Jean Carpenter.
By comparison, women made up f>B percent of coaches
in 1978 and 47.4 percent in 1998, according to the study.
