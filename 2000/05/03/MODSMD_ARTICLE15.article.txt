## Memo emerges with material on Gore and Clinton 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — A memo by a
former prosecutor says that Vice Presi
dent A 1 Gore may have given false state
ments to FBI agents and that President
Clinton should be investigated in connec
tion with a business executive's $1.5 mil
lion in donations to the Democratic
Party, lawmakers were told yesterday.
Sen. Arlen Specter described portions
of ex-prosecutor Charles Laßella's unre
leased 1998 memo, which urges appoint
ment of an independent counsel to inves
tigate Gore, Clinton and former deputy

White House chief of staff Harold li kes,
the president's fund-raising coordinator
for the 1996 election.
The White House complained about
Specter's tactics.
"To read a memo and then to ask
questions using lines from the memo
when it's supposed to be confidential isn't
the way I think the United States Senate
is supposed to work," White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
Attorney General Janet Reno declined
to appoint an independent counsel to

probe campaign fund-raising and
Republicans have been urging the Justice
Department to release Laßella's memo
ever since.
Specter and his staff have read the
memo and other Justice Department
documents on campaign fund-raising in
recent weeks.
According to Specter, R-Pa., the
memo says"The vice president may have
given false statements" and that Gore's
lack of recollection about fund-raising is
"reminiscent" of his "lack of recall of the

Buddhist temple matter." Gore main
tains he didn't realize a 1996 event he
attended at a Buddhist temple was a
fund-raiser.
At issue in the Laßella memo are
Gore's denials that he knew some of the
money he was raising in phone calls from
the White House was being placed in
"hard money" accounts, which go to can
didates, as opposed to "soft money,"
which goes toward general party-build
ing. Laßella's report cites 13 memos that
Ickes sent Gore referring to "hard"

money. Gore says he never read the
memos.
Laßella also said former White House
chief of staff Leon Panetta recalled that
Gore was attentive in meetings where the
subject was discussed and that notes by
Gore's chief of'staff reflect discussion of
the matter at a meeting attended by the
vice president.
Gore said he didn't pay close attention
to the details of fund-raising and took
restroom breaks during meetings
because he drank so much iced tea.
