(AP) — It took Sabrija Colic five
years to return to his prewar yard
— only to iind that he was unable
to cross the threshold into what
remained of his house.
Since returning to his village 35
miles east of Sarajevo last month,
the 74-year-old man has spent
much of his time sitting on a stump
a few feet from his home's wrecked
shell, staring at the doorstep where
two land mines were found. He
fears more are inside.
"I'm just sitting here looking at
my house, figuring how am I
going to get in. God only knows
how many booby-traps are inside,"
Colic said. He sleeps with three
neighbors in a tent in his courtyard
in the eastern Bosnian town of
Zepa.
Colic and about 20 other Bosni
an Muslims returned to Zepa in
late April, the first returnees since
the entire population — all Mus
lim — fled when the town fell to
the Serbs in 1995 despite being
declared a U.N. "safe zone." One
hundred more are to return today
under NATO escort. Hundreds of
people remain missing; many are
believed to have been executed by
the Serbs.
It is a pattern being repeated
across Bosnia. More than 5,500
people have returned this year,
nearly three times the number of
spontaneous returns at this time
last year, according to Wendy
Rappeport of the U. N. High
Commissioner for Refugees in
Sarajevo.
By the time the war ended in
1995, over a quarter of Bosnia's
prewar population of 4.5 million
was displaced. Only 300,000 have
gone home, according to U.N.
refugee agency. Ilie others are
either dead, have settled perma
nently elsewhere, or fear returning
to regions controlled by former
enemies.
I here is no money for rebuild
ing the hundreds of thousands of
homes destroyed in Bosnia during
the war, or for removing mines
from booby-trapped dwellings so
that rebuilding can begin.
