# Tensions rise in Puerto Rico

... .VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) — With a show
down looming over the U.S. Navy's prime
Atlantic training ground, protesters who have
blocked bombing for over a year said yesterday
that federal agents would have to arrest theni to
clear the range but promised they wouldn't light
back.
Scores of Puerto Ricans kept a vigil at the main
gate to the restricted Navy compound on Vieques
Island, jeering at soldiers in passing Humvees.
With three U.S. warships offshore, the occupiers
readied for what they called "the invasion" with
goggles, petroleum jelly and vinegar-soaked rags
to protect against tear gas.
"They are trying to create panic among the
people with this deployment," protester Robert
Rabin told the crowd, referring to the arrival of
three U.S. warships — reportedly carrying 1,000
Marines — a flay before. "The people of Vieques
have determined that not one more bomb will be
dropped here."
The range has been occupied by protesters
since a civilian security guard was killed by stray
bombs in April 1999, releasing pent-up frustra
tions throughout Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory of
4 million people. Arrests planned this week would
be carried out in an operation directed by the jus
tice Department, Pentagon officials say.
The Pentagon insists that its range on the east
ern third of Vieques is vital to national security
because it provides live-fire combat training
before every deployment of Atlantic Fleet carrier
battle groups abroad, practicing precision bomb
ing as well as amphibious assaults.
About 50 protesters at several camps inside the

range are blockingJan..sl. divetti-w. by.
dent Chilton allowing the Navy to resume limited
training until Vieques' 9,400 residents decide in a
referendum — probably next year — whether the
Navy should leave.
The Navy announced yesterday that, under
Clinton's directive, it will begin removing 1,600
tons of munitions from the western third of
Vieques tomorrow in order to transfer the feder
al land — nearly N,OOO acres — to Puerto Rico
later this year. Army and Navy personnel will
remove the conventional munitions in a 10-day
operation, said Navy spokesman Robert Nelson.
I'he Navy purchased its two-thirds of "Vieques
on the eve of World War 11. Civilians are sand
wit lied in the middle third.
Puerto Rican Gov. Pedro Rossello — who sup
ports the removal of the protesters as well as the
eventual closure of the range — said local author
ities were ready to deal with any unrest.
"I believe the Puerto Rican people won't par
ticipate in illegal acts," lie said Monday. "Howev
er, we are prepared at any time ... to establish
law and order."
Most protesters planned to surrender peace
fully. But a few threatened to scatter into the
bomb-littered bush, raising the spec ter of a dan
gerous hunt.
Protestant and Catholic churches have thrown
their weight behind the protest, helping erect a
chapel inside the bombing range and (ailing on
Puerto Rica us to support the civil disobedience.
flie (Geneva-based World ('.ouncil of ('.hurt lies
appealed to Clinton to "call a halt to this inter
vention immediately."
