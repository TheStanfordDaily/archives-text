# Moroccan marathoner sworn in as U.S. citizen

### 
(AP) â€” Khalid Khannouchi,
the marathon world record-hold
er, was sworn in as a U.S. citizen
yesterday, but it was uncertain
whether he could compete for the
United States at the Olympics if he
made the team.
Blocking the way could be the
International Olympic Committee
and the Moroccan Olympic Com
mittee.
lOC rules state that an athlete
must wait three years to compete
for his new country. That period
can be reduced or eliminated only
if three parties agree: the previous
national Olympic committee,
track's international ruling body
and the lOC.
The general secretary of the
Moroccan federation, Abdellatif el
Jazouli, suggested Morocco would
not approve.
"We have not been contacted,"
he told The Associated Press.
"Nobody has asked us anything. If
there is an official request, we will
put it ( to,,our federal council to
decide.
"For us, the rules must be
applied. It's not up to the LAAF.
It's up to the national federation."
Giorgio Reineri, a spokesman
for the ruling lAAF, said the
three-year rule does not apply. He
said an athlete must be a citizen of
the new country to compete for
that country, unless he or she has
competed for the former country
in the past three years.
The last time the 28-year-old
Khannouchi ran for Morocco was
at the 1993 World University
Games at Buffalo, N.Y.
Khannouchi, who had been
hoping to obtain his U.S. citizen
ship since arriving in the United
States in 1993, set his sights on
running in Sunday's U.S. Olympic
marathon trials at Pittsburgh.
But he has an ankle injury and
his trainer has told him to not race
lor the next six weeks.
Khannouchi will discuss his
plans today in New York. He
could decide to run at Pittsburgh
or wait until July and compete in
the 10,000 meters in the U.S.
Olympic track and field trials at
Sacramento, Calif.
"Khalid has had injuries that
could curtail his career," said Ger
ard Hartmann, who has been
treating Khannouchi in Ireland.

"There's no way he should run the
marathon trials, although as San
dra (Khannouchi's wife) says, he
could run 2:12 in his sleep."
A time of 2 hours, 12 minutes,
might be good enough to earn
Khannouchi a place on the three
man U.S. team.
Khannouchi would not discuss
his intentions yesterday at a City
Hall ceremony in Houston, where
he was made an honorary citizen
of the city.
"This is a great clay to finally
happen," he said. "It's something
we've been working on for over
two years. I owe a great responsi
bility to the people who made this
happen for me and gave me this
chance. Now 1 have the ball and it
is my responsibility to prove that
all of this was worth it.
"I have a lot of friends here
now. I have a new home here. I
want to give something back. 1 still
love my country but 1 have been
treated so well and given so much
support here that I want to run for
America."
Khannouchi acknowledged the
strain of all the developments.
"1 want to get with my trainer
and talk things over," he said. "I
feel good, but you want to make
the right decision. You don't want
to do something that might harm
your career."
After leaving Morocco seven
years ago and arriving in the Unit
ed States, Khannouchi settled in
New York. In 1996, he married
Sandra Inoa, a runner he had met
during a race in Hartford, Conn.
Khannouchi qualified for citi
zenship under a law that enables
spouses of U.S. citizens working
abroad for an American company
to achieve citizenship regardless of
the three-year residency require
ment. Last month, his wife accept
ed a job overseas with a U.S. firm.
If Khannouchi qualifies for the
U.S. team at Sydney, it would
mean that he would run four
marathons within a calendar year.
In the past, he never has run more
than one.
Last October, he set the world
record of 2:05:42 in the Chicago
Marathon.
He then ran the London
Marathon on April l(i and fin
ished third at 2:08:36 but injured
himself.
