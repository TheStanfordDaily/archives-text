## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Parenting teens is just as
important as holding down a government job, President
Clinton said yesterday in signing an executive order pro
hibiting discrimination against parents in the federal work
place.
"Believe it or not, there are still some employers who are
reluctant to hire or to promote employees who have chil
dren at home," Clinton said at a White House conference
011 raising and mentoring responsible teens.
"The goal of this order simply says no glass ceiling for
parents," Clinton said.
The order ensures that workers are not discriminated
against simply because they are parents. It applies only to
federal workers and does not require approval from
Congress.
"The job they're doing at home is more important any
way, and if they can do your job, you ought not to stop
them," Clinton said to employers of parents.
Parents, teens, teachers, youth workers and others
attended tlie daylong conference, which was moderated by
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. Topics included what

parents and communities can do to help teens succeed,
how parents can spend more time with their teens, and the
media's effect on youth and parenting.
She announced an Internet site for teen-agers
(httf )://www.americasteens.gov) to help them with home
work, hobbies and careers. The site is being developed by
17 federal agencies.
Republican National Committee spokesman Chris
Paulitz complained that the conference relied heavily 011
liberal-minded panelists.
Mrs. Clinton "used to say it takes a village to raise a
child," Paulitz said. "Now all it takes is partisan Democrats
and Hollywood moguls."
Actor and producer Danny DeVito, father of two teens
and a 12-year-old, and his wife, actress Rhea Perlman,
spoke in the East Room of the White House about success
ful after school initiatives in Los Angeles.
"We have to listen to kids," DeVito said. "There are so
many things going through their heads. They're confused.
They're mad, or sad. What do they do if they don't have
anybody who they can trust or turn to?"
