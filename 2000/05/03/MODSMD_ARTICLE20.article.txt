## The 						Stanford Daily Lack of professionalism during runoffs taints ASSU 
### 
AT LEAST LAST week's onslaught
of runoff campaigning brought
things back to normal — the entire
student body was once again
reminded of how ASSU elections are indeed
not about issue-oriented debates, but instead,
about petty name-calling and mudslinging.
For a while, there had been hope. In the
weeks preceding the original election, candi
dates seemed to be rallying around specific
issues, pointing to their platforms as support,
and arguing among each other about what
directions the ASSU should pursue next year.
But it seems that all such issues were aban
doned in the wake of the first elections round,
as candidates went another route this past

week, evidenced by the clever fliers plastered
around campus, touting either "Integrity" or
"What do you want this election to be about?"
Even more questionable e-mails were sent
out; various individuals switched endorse
ments — all of which combined to create a
partisan circus to which the student body had
to be subjected.
ASSU President Mike Levin was criticized
at last night's Undergraduate Senate meeting
for not taking more of a leadership role in last
week's ongoings and for not nipping the
brewing division in the bud. I bis is perhaps a
valid point, but it probably would have been
difficult for him to carry that out once he
publicly supported Newton/Villegas.

The announcement last night at the Consti
tutional Council meeting that Levin had been
dropped from the two charges he had origi
nally signed his name to brings up interesting
questions about partisan involvement. When
the outcome of the runoff was unclear, Levin
signed on to a charge that could, at the coun
cil's discretion, overturn the election. Howev
er, once Newton/Villegas won, lit- dropped the
charges, raising questions about whether there
were partisan motivations behind them.
What is the outcome of potentially partisan
actions and relentless in-house bickering that
came out of this past week's runoff election?
Undoubtedly, it means a steep road ahead for
ASSU President-elect Seth Newton.

Whatever inaction the ASSU lias been crit
icized for, it has, in tlie past year, also been
responsible for a list ol commendable accom
plishments, ranging from Stanford After
Midnight to the post office forums. Indeed,
all seemed to be under control and going
quite well until the ASSU elections descended
upon us. The past two weeks' worth ol ridicu
lous quibbling and out-and-out politicking
has disserviced a year's worth of hard work in
the eyes of the student body.
Newton and Villegas will face an uphill
climb as they make eflbrts to reverse students'
impressions of the ASSU as a divided institu
tion, which, in some students' minds, has
become its most visible role.
