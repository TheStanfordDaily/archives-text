# THERE IS NO SPOON
## How e-commerce got me 
### 
Hi. My name is Adrian, and I'm
an eßay addict. I didn't always
believe in thf* power of eßay,
and, in fact, 1 was one of the
last people I knew to start shopping
online.
Last year, it seemed like everyone
around me had at least bought a book
from Amazon.com or an album from
CDNow. Some of my friends purchased
an entire quarter's worth of books over

the Internet. They
claimed it was cheaper
and more convenient.
But I wasn't entirely
convinced.
After all, if pimply
teenagers in Indiana
could hack my entire
identity online, how
could I be sure that my
credit cards would be
safe? And wasn't

fondling and smelling the books part of a
typical bookstore experience?
After my more OS-inclined friends
gently explained that Sandra Bulhxk in
"The Net" was not a typical Internet
experience (and alter I got extremely
weird looks from the stall at Borders), I
decided to try out this new-fangled,
Internet contraption.
And I was soon lost to the world ofe
commerce. I never had to deal with lines
or snippy salespeople or, worst of all, hav
ing something not be in stock. If Amazon
didn't have it, I'd jump over to Barnes
and Noble or Varsitvßooks or something
else dot com.
But I got tired of only buying books
and music. And I would frequently run
into out-of-print tags on Amazon. So 1
decided to look for certain nostalgiac
memoribilia that I sometimes collect. And
I found my savior in eßay.
Before the great eßay revolution, I'd
pretend to go to Berkeley or San Francis
co on some cultural pretense — museums
worked well. And then I'd raid wax/
vinyl record stores in the Haight or scour
used video stores on Telegraph. Sales
people would tell me: "Hey, we don't
have that here. Why don't you try the
Web?"
(Well, actually, it would sound more
like: "Old Transformers cartoon memori
bilia? X-Men comic books? BWAHAHA
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!")
Sure, I had legit out-of-print books
and records to buy that Amazon or
bn.com didn't carry, but what I really
wanted were old cartoons. Yup, I had a
fetish for Saturday morning animation.
Anything late 80s or early 90s would
do: Thundercats, Transformers, 0.1.J0e,
Masters of the Universe, Voltron. You

name it.
Remember the little guy floating
friend of Prince Adam on He-Man?
Remember the name of the female G.I.
Joe agent who threw spears? Orko and
Lady Jane.
I think it was a co-worker last summer
who introduced me to the joy that is
eßay. 1 can even remember my first bid:
$1.35 for the Dungeons and Dragons
pilot episode.
Before long, 1 was bidding three times
<i day, devising bid war strategies (the best
one seems to be to wait until the last six
minutes of an auction before a first bid),
and signing tip for e-mail alerts.
1 even had my computer at work show
eßay continuously in a separate* little
browser window. I was hooked.
Finally, six months — and many Visa
bills — later, I stopped my eßay fanat
acism. faking classes again certainly
helped since I couldn't track MyAuctions
throughout the day. But I'd like to think
that it was my high degree of self-control
that enabled me to break my cycle of
credit card abuse. (Yeah, right.)
fin now making public the shame and
horror of my Internet dependency to
warn others about the possibilities off
commerce addiction.
just this afternoon, I had to talk down
a 112 riend who was ordering groceries from
VVebVan for the third time! "C'mon,
man, it's not worth it! It's not like they
even go door to door! You still have to
walk to the yellow Hag thingee!"
And, nowadays, it's hard to surfdown
the information superhighway without
fender-bending some great new e-coin
merce invention. (How's that for extend
ed metaphor?)
Personal shopping assistants, Internet
price guides, auction surfers — the list
goes on and on. It seems like every mall
store has a Web site with online ordering.
And it seems like any service anybody
could ever want has an "e" in front of it.
E-banking. E-dating. E-shoeshining.
While digital shopping may be the
bright future of "Generation-I," I guar
antee that it's more addictive than you
think. For me, I think I'll just stick to the
nice and easy, old-fashioned way of shop
ping — even if I don't yet have the Opti
mus Prime cave headquarters set.
Just give me a gift certificate to
Kepler's or a snazzy gift card for lower
Records. Or even a half-hour in Border's
with a nice book to fondle.
