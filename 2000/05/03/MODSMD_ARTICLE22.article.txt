Stanford Arboretum under attack again
fhe Stanford Arboretum is under
attack again. The April 2(i issue of The
Stanford Report states that the plans "to
build new performing arts facilities near
the downtown area of Palo Alto and on
the Stanford Campus" have progressed
to the point that funding is available for a
feasibility study. The San Jose Mercury
News reported on April 22 that one of the
sites proposed is "across El ('.amino Real
on Stanford-owned land in the vicinity of
El Camino Park." I lie sites described are
in the Stanford Arboretum.
My letter that was published by The
Daily on January 25 ("Preserve Arbore
tum open space") discussed the Stanford
Draft Community Plan which removed
two significant pieces from the arboretum
area classified by the University in 1992 as
"Special Reserve and Open Space."
One piece is the housing site proposed
for the green belt between El Camino and
the Hoover Hospital Pavilion, and the
other is the lot at the northwest corner at
Calve/, and Campus Drive, presumably
for a paved parking lot. Now we have
planning that may remove a third piece.
I have obtained the following informa
tion from the Stanford Archives. A sketch
dated 1901-03 shows the whole area
between the mausoleum and the highway
as "Arboritum" [sir]. In David Starr Jor
dan's autobiography, "Days of a Man," he
writes, "The University's main avenue of
approach, a mile long, passes through the
Arboretum, an interesting and delightful
feature of the Campus. This occupies a

generous tract of level ground between
the Quadrangle and the state highway
following the old 'Camino Real'. .."
Apart from the construction of the
Hoover Pavilion in 1932, the Arboretum
area has not suffered significant develop
ment during the first 1 10 years of the
University's existence. Now, quite rapid
ly, as the campus center is being built out,
the Arboretum looks to some as space
ripe for buildings and pavement.
It is hard to imagine a large theatre
and associated parking lots being built
close to the entrance to the University at
Palm Drive, but it might happen. I sug
gest that the theater, together with
underground parking, be placed next to
Frost Amphitheater, an alternate site that
was mentioned in the San Jose Mercury
News article. Ibis site is not in the
Arboretum. I urge University officials to
favor the Frost Amphitheater site rather
than the Arboretum site.

Kofi Annan visit should serve as catalyst
for discussing U.N. issues
Kofi Annan, who will be Stanford's
Commencement speaker this year, has
published a handsome book entitled
"'We the Peoples': The Role of the Unit
ed Nations in the 21st Century." His
Stanford talk will presumably be a para
ph rase of it. There is one section entitled
"Freedom from Fear. The need for a

more human-centered approach to secu
rity is reinforced by the continuing dan
gers that weapons of mass destruction
pose to humanity."
I he issue of such weapons is an explo
sive issue in the United States, where the
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, Jesse Helms, has issued a
blunt, even crude warning to President
Clinton that any new agreement in that
area would be blocked by him.
I he absence of any courses on the
United Nations at Stanford is indicative
of the general indifference, even hostility,
with which the organization is widely
viewed in this country. Stanford should
organize some meetings to discuss the
issues raised by Kofi Annan.
