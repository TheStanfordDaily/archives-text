## Stember sprints to Sydney 
### BEN ALLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
When the track and field Olympic Trials roll into
Sacramento in mid-July, at least one Stanford athlete
will be working with the home-track advantage. The
I rials will be a homecoming of sorts for redshirt junior
Michael Stember, who will take a crack at qualifying for
the ()lympics in the 1,500- and 800-meter runs.
Its pretty surreal to have the Trials in your home
town as a runner," Stember said. "But if the track meet
was anywhere else, I d be just as intent upon achieving
my goal to qualify for the (Mympic Games."
1 hose who follow track and field know that Stern
berg ()lympic goal is anything but far fetched. I le has
been racingat the top level of 'competition since his days
at Jesuit I ligh in (larmic hael, just outside of Sacramen
to, where he was a two-time state champion and a na-

tional leader in the 1,600 meters,

Despite having been injury-prone while at
Stanford, Stember has continued to succeed.

Last year, after redshirting
his outdoor track season,

Stember finished a close
fourth in Eugene, Ore. at

the USA I K National
Championships in the
1,500, missing the World

Championships by just
one spot.
Then, Stember was

racing on only four

weeks of training. I bis time around,
Stember has nine solid months under
his belt. The base is there.

"In the past, there have always been
one or two little things that got in the
way," Stember said. "Maybe an injury
social things I might have gotten in
voked in, staying up late, doing col
lege life."

But Stember has been careful to do
everything right in this ()1\ mnic year.

In addition to intense training, that means
paying attention to the little things — daily
stretching to maintain range of motion
staying hydrated, not staying out all night.

"Once I took everything seriously, tilings
just started falling into place," Stember said.
Now, his mental preparation and physic al
fitness are reaching new heights.

"I've done all I can to go to the next level.
I'm ready for a breakthrough."'
Stember expects that breakthrough to
come before the Trials. Practices with sopho
more teammate Gabe Jennings, anothei
Olympic hopeful in the 1,500 meters, have
brought training intensitv to a new level.

"It's always good to
have competition among
your teammates. There's
tension at times, but we
keep it low key and com
municate about it," Stem
ber said.

"We take practices at face value — Gabe and 1 help
each other out, push each other and try not to get in
each other's grill about the experience."
Jennings was sixth in the Eugene 1,500 last year,
and teammate J onathon Riley, who has since shifted his
focus to the 5,000 meters, was fifth. Jennings was the in
door mile champ this year, with Stember just behind in
second.

"It definitely is a little difficult [training with Jen
nings]," he said. "We both have the same coach and the
same goal, but we have control of the situation. It's a
healthy vibe.

"1 would love more than anything if both of us
qualified for the ()lympics."
For now, there's room at the top for both, since
qualifying will mean capturing one of the top three

spots at the Trials, which take place |wlv 14-23. But
entrance to the Olympic Games requires that run-

ners meet a minimum time standard — I 1
minutes, 30.8 seconds for the 1,500 meters.
Stember's best to date is a 3:39.05 lit

ran in (lermany last summer. Jennings has
run 3:39.85. Their mile bests are 3:58.57

and 3:59.32, respectively.
"I will not have a problem getting the
standard." Stember said. "Right now.

my main focus is on Sacramento. 1 lie
time will take care of itself. Mv training is

geared to run fast, and I'm reach to do that."
Stember may even hit the standard at this Fri
day's Cardinal Invitational here on the Farm.
"I think that race will be won right around
3:3(i or 3:37," says Stember. "I think the win
ner and maybe even the top three gu\ s have a
chance to get the standard. And I think Fin

one of them."
Though the 1,500 will be his main

l( h us, the setup of the I rials all< >ws for Stem
ber to try to grab a spot on the ()lvmpic team
in the 800 meters as well.
"I will go for the 1,500 — nothing
barred, no way out, no 800 as a safety valve.
I lowever, why not try and win both? It's in

my best interests."
But before attempting that double, Stember is

likely to try the same double at the NCAA Champi
onships in I )urham, S.C ]. on May 3 1 through J line 3.
"I'm going to score as many points as possible for
Stanford at NCAAs," Stember said. "To win a national
championship as a team — that would mean every
thing to me, to the other guys and to the program.
