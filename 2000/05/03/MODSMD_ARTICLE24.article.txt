# Calamity makes waves on Farm

### ELISSA KESZLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
kristen Koblik is known as
Calamity by teammates, fhe ju
nior's nickname started her fresh
man year when the water polo
team's upper classmen discovered
that it was her middle name.
Little did they know how well
her name lit. The word calamity
means misery and great misfor
tune, feelings Koblik dishes out to
her opponents in every game.
Koblik is one of two left-handed
players giving the Stanford
women's water polo team an added
advantage on offense by allowing
the Cardinal to be a threat from all
angles, including what is normally
the weak side. But she is best known
by the coaching staff and opposing
teams for her unrelenting defensive
skills.
"Calamity is tenacious, consis
tently rugged and determined on
defense," said head coach John
Tanner. "She has incredible bal
ance and never over commits to a
movement. She also can always get
a hand free, be in a passing lane,
and anticipate what offensive play
ers are going to do next."
To her teammates it is her inten

sitv, motivation and mental tough
ness that is most admirable.
"Calamity's work ethic is amaz
ing. She never lets down and never
plays les, ii.au one hundred per
cent in both games and practice,"
said freshman Julie Gardner.
"Kris combines a dedication to
technical skills with a zealous love
for competition," said junior co
captain Anne-Marie Keenan.
Koblik grew up in Davis, Calif,
and began competitive swimming
at the age of twelve. Her water polo
career started during her freshman
year at Davis I ligh School.
"I started playing polo because I
wanted something to do with my
time that wasn't staring at a black
line at the bottom of a pool. I want
ed something more interactive."
I lie catch was that her high
school did not have a women's pro
gram. Thus Koblik became one of
two girls on the men's team. Koblik
played on the men's team during
her freshman and sophomore
years.
The winter following her s< >pho
more season, Koblik dec ided to j< tin
the LC-Davis women's club team
where she participated in the Win
ter Indoor Senior Nationals. Bv
that following spring she was select -

echo the I nited States Youlli I eain
and traveled to Portland, Oregon
in 1996 and Ottowa, Canada in
1997 to play in her first internation
al tournament.
Dong Wright, head coach of the
I ('.-Davis club team, was impressed
by the play of'both Koblik and l.ig
aya Smith, the other female on the
Davis high school team. I It' also no
ticed an increasing interest in the
sport among local high school girls.

Together, Wright, Smith and
Koblik worked togethei to form the
high school's first women's squad.
"Playing on the girl's team was a
lot different than playing with the
guvs." Koblik said. "Most of the girls
began with no pi ior history of water
polo or swimming. Being one of the
few people with experience, 1
played the role of half player and
half cc >ach."
In addition to Koblik's water

polo and swimming skills, slu- was
also a successful academic in high
school and graduated as a national
merit scholar. I ler success in both
acadeinia and sports caught the eye
of the then-Stanford's head coach
Hen Quittner, and ultimate!) led to
Koblik being one ol Stanford's top
recruits in 1997.
At Stanford, Koblik has contin
