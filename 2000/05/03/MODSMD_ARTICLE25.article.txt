### MINAYO NASIALI 
It was a jam-packed weekend for men and
women's c rew , as iliev hosted Big Row , jusiK named
!<>r its many participating schools.
<)1 1 Saturday and Sunday at Redwood shores,
Stanford's varsity, junior varsity, and novice teams
hosted such participating schools as No. I (California,
No. 9 I niversity of Southern (California and No. 15
()reg<>ii State.
Although cross-town rival California swept the
Stanford men and women's c rew teams in six com
petitions. the women's team rallied to defeat Texas in
two afternoon races. The Cardinal lost to the Bears in
the men's and women's varsity, junior varsity, and
no\ ice competitions. I lowever, the Stanford women
defeated the Texas Longhorns in the varsity and ju
nior varsit) races.
I he Hears pulled ahead early in the men and
women's varsity 2000 meters. 1 lie top-ranked Cal
men finished the 2000 meter in 5:36.26, a new course
record, while the Stanford men crossed the finish line
in 5:57.05. Ihe N0.5 (Cal women finished in 6:23..'56,
while Stanford was timed at 6:5.'}.79.
l he race against Cal was the women's third event

ol the weekend. 1 hey had previously competed
against Washington State and Kansas. However, Cal
had only had one race under its belt before compet
ing against Stanford. I his fatigue factor, as well as
Cal's high ranking, had an effect on the margin be
tween Cal and Stanford's finishing times.
"If we had been on equal terms in regards to hav
ing both competed in the same amount of competi
tions prior to our race, there would definitely have
been a closer margin between the two times," com
mented women's head coach Aimee Baker.
1 "he women's varsity and junior varsity are both
young teams, which may play a factor in their per
formances. However, their determination, demon
strated by their victory over Texas, and their feelings
c oncerning their race against Cal, will only strength
en their team and cohesiveness.
"Although we did not win against Cal we were re
ally pleased with our performance," said varsity
sophomore Marlayna 1 uiasopo. "Going against the
third best crew in the country, we knew that it would
be a hard race. 1 was proud that we were able to hold
on to them in the first 1000 meters and kept strong
