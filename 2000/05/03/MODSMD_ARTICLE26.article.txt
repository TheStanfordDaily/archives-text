# A 						count down to the title
## 
### 
Fifth. Fourth. Third. Sec
ond ... Seems to have a
natural progression,
doesn't it?
It's rare in sports these days you
can lind such a deliberate order.

But the women's
water polo team
pla\s a deliber
ate game.
The women
head this week to
1 ndianapolis,
that inexplicable
met t a of the
a(|iiatii world, as

the first seed in this weekend's 16-
team national championship tour
nament. 1 'his year, the) hope to fin
ish off the countdown the\ began
five years ago with their inaugural
varsity season. I hat countdown, of
coin se. could lead to a national title.
Since 1990, the first year as a var
sity sport at Stanford, the Cardinal
has made five straight appearances
in the national championship tour
nament. In 1996, they finished
fifth,in 1997, fourth, in 1998, third.


Jeff Cooper
\ ou see where this is going.
Last year, hopes were high that
the women might skip a step when
they headed to the national title
game against USC. But in a live
overtime hcartbreaker, the Trojans
claimed a 7-0 victory and the crown.
Which brings us to 2000. In the
parlance of NASA: we're at T-minus
two and counting.
I he women's water polo world is
an elite neighborhood, to be sure,
l iie sport lives in the quasi-official
world oil he "developing sport;" not
enough schools can field teams for
the NCAA to administer champi
onships, but enough can field them
foi their to develop a distinctly strat
ified world of talent. No team out
side of top foursome — USC,
I ( LA, California and Stanford —
has made the national title game in
the last lour years.
Indeed, the Mountain Pacific
Sports federation has taken over
the collegiate game: nine of the ten
MI'SI teams were selected to the
championship tournament, includ
ing the top six seeds and nine ol the
top eleven seeds.
I his kind of neighborhood
makes lor claustrophobia. With a
limited pool ol talent (if you will) —

only a single player on Stanford's
team comes from outside Califor
nia, and Cal, UCLA, and USC each
feature less than five non-natives on
25-woman rosters — the recruiting
battle is intense. The recruit you lose
today will surely show up on an op
ponent's roster tomorrow.
That's why the Cardinal's history
makes it impressive. Starting from
an admittedly hallowed club team
history the coaching staff has me
thodically assembled a winner in
front of their hungry neighbors
eyes. A goalkeeper here; a two
meter defender there. Like a sky
scraper, the squad has taken shape
from the ground up.
The last few pieces may have
been put into place this year. Fresh
man Julie Gardner scored two of
Stanford's three goals, including the
game-winner in overtime against
(lal two weeks ago to put them into
the national championships. In that
game, redshirt freshman Jackie
Frank continued her stellar play in
goal as well.
Between Gardner's offense and
Frank's defense, the team appears
lobe peaking at the right time. After
going 0-3 against archrival ('.al dur
ing the regular season, Stanl* >rd has
edged them f>-4 in the MPSF cham
pionships and 3-2 in the national
qualifiers in the last four weeks.
If, indeed, the team comes home
with a national title this weekend, it

will complete perhaps the purest ex
ample of the model that Stanford
coaches have used to build domi
nating varsity programs for
decades. Don't think the men's
hockey team, the women's lacrosse
team, the rugby teams aren't taking
notice. Head coach John Tanner
has led his Cardinal down the path
they're looking to follow in the next
decade: starting small, recruiting
the best and holding onto them for
every year you can get.
Where does the team go from
here? Tough to say. Considering,
though, the team went 7-3 against
its elite neighbors, including 5-0
against USC and UCLA, it's tough
not to be optimistic. With 1998 star
Ellen Fstes and highly touted re
cruit Brenda Villa returning from
an ()lympic tour after 2000, Tanner
may find himself with more pieces
to his juggernaut than he knows
what to do with.
It's a simple model: start from
the ground floor and never stop
building. The team doesn't know
where it's going to lead in the years
to come. Now, though, the future is
a place far away. They're hoping
they can end the five-year count
down this weekend with first place.

Jeff Hooper, a junior, litis noticed that you
look a little bit fatigued lately. Are you
sleeping well? Here, let vie get you sorrw
