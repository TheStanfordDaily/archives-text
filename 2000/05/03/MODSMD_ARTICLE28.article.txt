### BROOKE MORRILL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
lew know the vast number of waves the Stanford
sailing team has been making in the '99-'OO season.
Stanford competes within the Pacific Coast Intercol
ligiate Yacht Racing Assossiation (PCIYRA) in three
categories of regattas — Women, Team Racing and
Coed Fleet Rac ing. With one national qualifier already
(linched in team rating, the team is looking to this com
ing weekend in Santa Barbara to secure its spot for fleet
racing nationals.
Spring break kicked-off the season as the Stanford
sailors headed to the East Coast lor ten days of intense
prac tic e and four regattas.
"We often think of our East Coast competitions as
dress rehearsals for Nationals," said senior co-captain
Anikii l.eerssen. "'l'he top twenty teams are always
there and every team wants to prove their national
ranking and improve their skill level."
Stanford entered TRUX, the coed fleet racing re
galia, with ,i goal of finishing among tlie top ten teams.
11 c ame out slightly short, with an eleventh place finish.
"We are constantly setting goals throughout the sea
son relative to our district and to the nation," said head
coach Steve Bourclow. "1 low we finish in national com
petitions simpl) help determine if our goals are accu
rate. We are not discouraged by our finish."
I he women, who have been consistently ranked as
a t< >p team nationally, had a tremendous showing in the
two East Coast regattas. Ii proved its merit as a tough
competitor at St. Mary's by placing second overall.
I lie women then dominated the second weekend's
i egatta, the President's (!up, hosted by Boston Univer
sity. Leerssen placed first in A-division and junior Sally
Madsen came out with a c lutch second place finish in B
(li\ ision to give the women's team a first place standing.
"We came back with lots of optimism and a feeling
of respect because of our results within regattas of such
intense competition," l.eerssen said.
I lie team racing team, composed ofcoterminal stu
c lent Steve Klcha and senior crew Katie Cregg, senior
1 yler Doyle and 112 reshman crew Lindsey Andrews, and
junior Jeff Condon and junior crew Meg Crowfoot,
competed during the final weekend of Spring Break in
the NEISA regatta hosted by the Coast Guard, and
placed fourth overall.
"We looked at N EISA as a development regatta. We
wanted to gain skills and see what we are missing in

order to prepare for a strong district qualifier," Bour
dow said.
The development was put to test during the team
racing district qualifier at on April Ist and 2nd, where
the top two teams are determined for nationals.
Stanford was among the top four teams by the sec
ond day and outsailed Hawaii and Santa Barbara to
capture the number two spot behind USC and a berth
to Nationals.
"We were getting beat by other teams in the district
this year: USC, UCSBand Hawaii. But din ing tourna
ment play, we managed to show these teams that we
won't lay down, we won't go quietly," Kleha said.
The women's team had a disappointing finish dur
ing their district qualifier, and w ill not be present at Na
tionals this June. The team looks to lleet racing as its last
chance to secure another spot in competing nationally.
"We're not feeling nervousness. We're not feeling
anxiety. Nobody expects the underdogs to make a
killing," Kleha said. "But we've practiced so hard and
so long that our energy is not focused on what we can't
do, but on what we can do to our opponents."
