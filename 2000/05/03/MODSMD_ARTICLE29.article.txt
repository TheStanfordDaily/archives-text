### AMIT GARG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Yesterday afternoon, about 70 people
gathered in Building 370 to hear Social Sci
ence Prof. Renato Rosaldo urge them,
quoting from a poem, to "remember what
you are, remember who you are, remem
ber where you came from, even when
there is prejudice."
Rosaldo has done extensive research on
cultural citizenship in California, and is a
member of the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences.
Rosaldo began the 15th Annual Ernesto
Galarza Lecture, titled "In This Together:
Cultural Citizenship and the Politics of Dif
ference," with an epigram on social posi
tion. "Invisibility is a dangerous condition .

. . . You look in the mirror and see noth
ing."
After reading a small poem of his own,
Rosaldo tried to define the "weight of the
term culture.
"Culture is often seen as the fluff, the
icing over the cake, not the cake itself. But
it goes much deeper than that," he said.
"The problem of universal citizenship is
that it assumes sameness. It presupposes all
are the same â€” monoglot, not polyglot,"
he said. "Culture mediates conduct and
perception about society. It allows us to se
lect ideas from a complex reality."
He urged people to see "through an
other point of view," and realize that "cul
ture can be an argument, where some voic
es don't get heard."
Rosaldo discussed "respeto," "the way

to get other people hearing." I le cited his
own scholarship and several philosophers,
such as Marx and Durkheim.
The Annual Ernesto (lalarza (loinniem
orative Lecture was inaugurated by the
Stanford Center for Chicano Research in
1986.
The annual lecture was named for by
Dr. Ernesto Galarza (1905-1984), a Stan
ford alumnus, intellectual, visionary and
scholar who galvanized national attention
on the plight of the farm workers in the
1940s and 19505, and later focused on
urban development of Chicanos in the
United States.
The speech began with a welcome by
1 listory Prof. Al Camarillo, followed by the
announcement of prizes by Spanish-Por
tuguese Prof. Yvone Yarbro-Bejarano.

The prizes were given to graduate and un
dergraduate researchers focusing on Lati
no and Latina issues.
Prof, of Spanish and Portuguese
Cuadalupe Vaides said "the lecture was
very good. It helps to understand subordi
nation and privilege."
Senior Theresa Vargas said, "I can't say
in words what I feel. His lecture was very
informative and entertaining. The area he
is addressing is important but gets very lit
tle attention in scholarship."
Prof, of Civil and Environmental Engi
neering James Leckie, who has known
Rosaldo for 27 years, said, "ft was very
thoughtful, a new way of viewing the reali
ty of differences in our society and giving
value to these differences. Rosaldo is very
creative in his approach to these issues."
