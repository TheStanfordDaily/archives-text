# Casper reflects on his tenure

### DEENA SKOLNICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
During his one-year sabbatical.
University President Gerhard
Gasper plans to do three things:
read, prepare to teach undergrad
uates in the 2001 -'02 academic year
and hike in the Foothills, plans that
should not surprise members of the
Stanford community.
These simple plans embody the
issues and challenges which faced
Gasper during his years as presi
dent: academics, undergraduates
and community. In an interivew
with The Stanford Daily, Gasper
said he is optimistic when he looks
at the current academic state of the
University and its future.
As he leaves office, he says he
sees two major problems facing in
coming president John 1 Icnnessey.
The first is the overcrowding in fiu -
ulty and graduate student housing.
Gasper's second and more long
term concern is the role of the In
ternet and information technology
in teaching in the 21st century.
"What influence will it have on
residential universities such as Stan
ford? What will future generations
of students do?" Gasper asked. I le
said he finds the answers difficult
because, "this whole set of issues is
immensely complicated . . . .
There's a lot of hype, but nobody
has any idea of where it will go."
Gasper also sees this issue as one
of the biggest challenges to univer
sities across the country.

"My great worry is that, in a uni
versity such as Stanford, from the
point of view of the students, the
great attraction is that research and
teaching go together," he said. "In
the world everybody talks about
now, that is the world of online ed
ucation, all they talk about ever is
education.
"After we have worked so hard
to bring teaching and research to
gether .. . Tin wondering whether
we are not going to return toa prior
state, where the worlds of teaching
and research will emerge and sepa
rate in the end. That is something I
find extremely worrisome and
troublesome, and I think we must
do everything we can to avoid it."
But Gasper said he does not
think that changes in information
technology and increasing interest
in the sciences will change the cur
riculum at Stanford or at American
universities in general.
Gasper dismissed the supposed

current emphasis on engineering
and biotechnology at Stanford as a
symptom of Stanford's Silicon Val
ley location and the fact that large
science endowments garner dis
proportionate media attention.
Casper cited the money poured
into the new Bing Wing, the Stan
ford Museum and the Stanford In
troductory Studies program as
symptoms of the University's con
tinued strong commitment to the
humanities.
Several faculty members have
cited SIS and other programs to
foster undergraduate interest in
the humanities as Casper's biggest
contributions to Stanford. Accord
ing to Casper, these programs
"have been successful beyond my
wildest dreams.
"When I first proposed Stanford
Introductory Seminars in 1996, I
thought it would take us four or five

President Casper plans to teach a seminar or class on the "wonderful sub
ject" of constitutionalism after he leaves the presidency.
years to offer every freshman and
sophomore a faculty-taught semi
nar," said Casper. "In reality it t<x)k
us only two years."
Given his optimism about SIS, it
seems natural that Casper plans to
return to campus next spring to or
ganize a curriculum about what he
calls a "wonderful subject:" consti
tutionalism. He plans to teach a
freshman or sophomore seminar
or a sophomore college class about
what it means to have a constitution
and the concept of a constitution,
historically and in the present day.
"All of ibis [curriculum] needs a

very thorough going-through and
revamping and recasting and re
thinking," Casper said.
His second project, which is
"completely uncertain because [he
has] had no time to talk to people
and get people to do something
with [him]," is to teach an Introduc
tion to the Humanities sequence
with several other faculty members.
" That's a more radical change,"
he said of teaching I-HUM. "I
would really like to do something
altogether new and fresh."
Even with his focus on the Uni
versity, Casper still l<x)ks to the sur
rounding community and how its
concerns mesh with and conflict
with Stanford's. One major issue
during his tenure has been Stan
ford's General Use Permit and the

land Stanford owns in the f<x>thills.
"Part of the problem is that Sum
ford has an excellent record. Stan
ford has kept more open space than
anybody else on the Peninsula,"
Casper said. "And now the rest of
the Peninsula wants us to keep our
open spaces forever while they have
been doing away with theirs."
Casper cited the need to balance
Stanford's academic needs with the
needs of the community while stay
ing true to the original land charter
from the Stanford family.
"I always point out and empha
size the fact that the Board of
Trustees has a responsibility under
the land grant from the Stan
fords ... to maintain these lands
for the uses for which this Universi
ty was founded, and that means for

academic uses," Casper said. "I feel
very, very responsible as a trustee
that we do not give away what the
Stanfords gave us for a particular
purpose and which the people of
California were once very happy to
accept for that purpose."
In a press release yesterday,
Casper announced the launching
of a campaign to restore the
Foothills so that they will continue
to be available to Stanford affiliates
and members of the community.
Despite the opportunity that
the presidency afforded him to
deal with such complicated issues,
Casper says he has few regrets
about leavingthe office and re
turning to teaching after his sab
batical.
"When I think back on what has

been the most attractive . .. it's real
ly the great exposure to a wide
range of students and faculty and of
course alumni, as well," he said.
"That range will shrink, but I
think what I lose in quantity, I will
make up in quality."
Casper will not miss what he
calls the most challenging part of
the job of any university president:
responsibility. "You are held ac
countable for what your institution
does, and not only for what your
institution does, but also for what
the people in your institution do,"
he said. "When the Band misbe
haves, I'm being held responsible.
So you are held accountable across
a whole range of activities . . . but
basically you have very, very little
authority-

"All you have is the power of per
suasion ... It is really kind of a daily
challenge to get things moving
without anybody really wanting to
hear you say to them, 'Please do
this.'"
Asked whether he will miss the
powers that come with his office,
Casper's answer was a firm "no."
"Some people will ask me,
'You're in a very influential posi
tion, will you miss the influence?'
No, 1 don't think so. 1 am not ex
pecting that at all. 1 don't get any
kind of personal gratification out of
exercising that kind of influence."
And as for the most unexpected
part of his job, Casper's answer is
brief and decisive: "Caieties. Just
that simple. Nobody told me about
Caieties! Nobody warned me!"
