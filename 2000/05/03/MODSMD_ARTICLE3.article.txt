# Casper reflects on his tenure

### DEENA SKOLNICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
During his one-year sabbatical.
University President Gerhard
Gasper plans to do three things:
read, prepare to teach undergrad
uates in the 2001 -'02 academic year
and hike in the Foothills, plans that
should not surprise members of the
Stanford community.
These simple plans embody the
issues and challenges which faced
Gasper during his years as presi
dent: academics, undergraduates
and community. In an interivew
with The Stanford Daily, Gasper
said he is optimistic when he looks
at the current academic state of the
University and its future.
As he leaves office, he says he
sees two major problems facing in
coming president John 1 Icnnessey.
The first is the overcrowding in fiu -
ulty and graduate student housing.
Gasper's second and more long
term concern is the role of the In
ternet and information technology
in teaching in the 21st century.
"What influence will it have on
residential universities such as Stan
ford? What will future generations
of students do?" Gasper asked. I le
said he finds the answers difficult
because, "this whole set of issues is
immensely complicated . . . .
There's a lot of hype, but nobody
has any idea of where it will go."
Gasper also sees this issue as one
of the biggest challenges to univer
sities across the country.

"My great worry is that, in a uni
versity such as Stanford, from the
point of view of the students, the
great attraction is that research and
teaching go together," he said. "In
the world everybody talks about
now, that is the world of online ed
ucation, all they talk about ever is
education.
"After we have worked so hard
to bring teaching and research to
gether .. . Tin wondering whether
we are not going to return toa prior
state, where the worlds of teaching
and research will emerge and sepa
rate in the end. That is something I
find extremely worrisome and
troublesome, and I think we must
do everything we can to avoid it."
But Gasper said he does not
think that changes in information
technology and increasing interest
in the sciences will change the cur
riculum at Stanford or at American
universities in general.
Gasper dismissed the supposed

current emphasis on engineering
and biotechnology at Stanford as a
symptom of Stanford's Silicon Val
ley location and the fact that large
science endowments garner dis
proportionate media attention.
Casper cited the money poured
into the new Bing Wing, the Stan
ford Museum and the Stanford In
troductory Studies program as
symptoms of the University's con
tinued strong commitment to the
humanities.
Several faculty members have
cited SIS and other programs to
foster undergraduate interest in
the humanities as Casper's biggest
contributions to Stanford. Accord
ing to Casper, these programs
"have been successful beyond my
wildest dreams.
"When I first proposed Stanford
Introductory Seminars in 1996, I
thought it would take us four or five

ject" of constitutionalism after he leaves the presidency.
