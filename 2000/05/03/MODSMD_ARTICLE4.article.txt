# Plan for Dish area announced
## University attempts to conserve land, protect native species 
### CAITRIN MCKIERNAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After months of heated debate,
University President Gerhard
Casper announced yesterday a
conservation and use plan for the
Stanford Dish area.
Casper cited degradation of the
Foothills, specifically the threat to
native species, caused by increased
hiking and people jogging off
paved roads. The three-part plan
also addresses problems with
parking, traffic congestion and
safety near the Dish.
The plan, which will take 112 ull ef
fect Sept. 1, aims to preserve the

area, maintain it tor academic use
and provide a recreational space
for the Stanford community and
its neighbors.
"The plan is very logical, a good
step," said Allen Henderson, for
mer mayor and member of the
Palo Alto City Council, who has
helped re/one Palo Alto's foothills
to preserve open space.
Stanford's conservation and
use plan designates the Dish area
as a "special area for habitat con
servation and continued use," in
augurates a "program of environ
mental restoration and mainte
nance," and implements the
"management of recreational
use."
The University will designate
several hundred acres of the
Foothills as a preserve for long
term habitat conservation. Stan
ford will also explore agreements
with federal, state and local agen

cies to protect in the survival of
several species, such as the Califor
nia tiger salamander. The radio
telescopic dish will continue to
serve its academic purposes. New
research, as long as it complies
with conservation rules, will be
permitted.

The land restoration is neces
sary, explained Carol Hoggs, di
rector of the Stanford Center for
Conservation Biology, because
the land has been heavily
overused.

President Casper's statement, "A Conservation and Use Plan for the Stan
ford Dish Area," outlines a new approach to the land around the Dish.
"l am excited about the oppor
tunity for the University to be able
to do something constructive for
the environment while preserving
and enhancing academic work and
recreation," she said.
The Center for Conservation Bi
ology, which is a unit of the Stan
ford Department of Biological Sci
ences, will guide the stabilization of
the damaged areas through reveg
etation and the removal of unap
proved structures. It will also carry
out restoration of the environment
and construction of habitats neces
sary for the specific species.
The plan will limit recreational
use by permitting hiking and jog
ging only on clearly delineated
routes, forbidding clogs, picnics,
games and social events and allow
ing recreational access from dawn
until a half an hour before sunset.
The Office of Public Safety will hire
more officers to enforce the new
rules.
Some community members said
they were saddened that they now
have to stay on the set trail.
However, Boggs explained that
"if people go off the trail, it is very
difficult to do any kind of restora
tion."
Many said they did not like the
dog restriction and found it unnec

essary.
Palo Alto resident Linda Cohen
said she was "extremely abandoned
and hurt by this news" that she
could not make her daily walk on
the trails near the Dish with her
dogs. Cohen is a member of Penin
sula Access for Dogs, which tries to
educate people about "proper clog
use in open spaces."
Peter Drekmeier, Director of
Stanford Open Space Alliance, dis
agreed with the dog restriction as
well.
"Our position is that clogs
should be allowed on a leash be
cause we know that there is a prob
lem with them running wild," said
Drekmeier. He also objects to the
lack of new parking.
"()ne of the problems in terms of
habitat degradation is that Stanford
has closed all other parking" so that
the impact is all in one area.
"Ample parking not far from the
Dish area is available to the public
on weekends and holidays," said
Casper in a statement. "The limited
visitor parking during the business
hours is generally in full use." Cit
ing an overall regional traffic prob
lem faced by Stanford and local
governments, Casper encouraged
recreational users to walk, bicycle,
or use public transportation to the
Dish.
Santa Clara County sth District
Supervisor, Joe Simitian, was opti
mistic about the changes, but said
that he would "wait and see," fol
lowing the mandatory environ

mental assessment of the area by
the government.
" There is always a tension be
tween conservation and public ac
cess that is, to some degree, in
evitable," said Simitian.
Others thought that the Univer
sity was not doing enough to con
serve the land.
" If it were my choice, I would say
that they should restrict it to Stan
ford residents," said Roger Hol
land, a Palo Alto resident and envi
ronmentalist.
"It is a great compromise," stat
ed Sally Probst, President of the
Palo Alto League of Women Vot
ers, referring to the balance be
tween conservation and recreation.
"They chose to be more aware of
community desires... .1 think that
it would be better for the environ
ment [to exclude the non-Stanford
community], but I think that it is
better for community relations. I
think that it is very nice that they
did not close the area."
At many meetings and hearings,
Stanford's representatives have
publicly stated that Stanford's
foothills are not a public park.
"Nonetheless, we recognize the
recreational value of the area," said
Casper in the statement.
"On one level, Stanford does
own the land," said Paul Choi, a
medical student, who walks his dog
near the Dish everyday.
"But. .. Stanford does owe it to
the community to consider the ser
vice it provides," he added.

well.
"Our position is that clogs
should be allowed on a leash be
cause we know that there is a prob
lem with them running wild," said
Drekmeier. He also objects to the
lack of new parking.
"()ne of the problems in terms of
habitat degradation is that Stanford
has closed all other parking" so that
the impact is all in one area.
"Ample parking not far from the
Dish area is available to the public
on weekends and holidays," said
Casper in a statement. "The limited
visitor parking during the business
hours is generally in full use." Cit
ing an overall regional traffic prob
lem faced by Stanford and local
governments, Casper encouraged
recreational users to walk, bicycle,
or use public transportation to the
Dish.
Santa Clara County sth District
Supervisor, Joe Simitian, was opti
mistic about the changes, but said
that he would "wait and see," fol
lowing the mandatory environ

mental assessment of the area by
the government.
" There is always a tension be
tween conservation and public ac
cess that is, to some degree, in
evitable," said Simitian.
Others thought that the Univer
sity was not doing enough to con
serve the land.
" If it were my choice, I would say
that they should restrict it to Stan
ford residents," said Roger Hol
land, a Palo Alto resident and envi
ronmentalist.
"It is a great compromise," stat
ed Sally Probst, President of the
Palo Alto League of Women Vot
ers, referring to the balance be
tween conservation and recreation.
"They chose to be more aware of
community desires... .1 think that
it would be better for the environ
ment [to exclude the non-Stanford
community], but I think that it is
better for community relations. I
think that it is very nice that they
did not close the area."
At many meetings and hearings,
Stanford's representatives have
publicly stated that Stanford's
foothills are not a public park.
"Nonetheless, we recognize the
recreational value of the area," said
Casper in the statement.
"On one level, Stanford does
own the land," said Paul Choi, a
medical student, who walks his dog
near the Dish everyday.
"But. .. Stanford does owe it to
the community to consider the ser
vice it provides," he added.
