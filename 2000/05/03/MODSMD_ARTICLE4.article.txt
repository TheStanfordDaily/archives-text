# Plan for Dish area announced
## University attempts to conserve land, protect native species 
### CAITRIN MCKIERNAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After months of heated debate,
University President Gerhard
Casper announced yesterday a
conservation and use plan for the
Stanford Dish area.
Casper cited degradation of the
Foothills, specifically the threat to
native species, caused by increased
hiking and people jogging off
paved roads. The three-part plan
also addresses problems with
parking, traffic congestion and
safety near the Dish.
The plan, which will take 112 ull ef
fect Sept. 1, aims to preserve the

area, maintain it tor academic use
and provide a recreational space
for the Stanford community and
its neighbors.
"The plan is very logical, a good
step," said Allen Henderson, for
mer mayor and member of the
Palo Alto City Council, who has
helped re/one Palo Alto's foothills
to preserve open space.
Stanford's conservation and
use plan designates the Dish area
as a "special area for habitat con
servation and continued use," in
augurates a "program of environ
mental restoration and mainte
nance," and implements the
"management of recreational
use."
The University will designate
several hundred acres of the
Foothills as a preserve for long
term habitat conservation. Stan
ford will also explore agreements
with federal, state and local agen

cies to protect in the survival of
several species, such as the Califor
nia tiger salamander. The radio
telescopic dish will continue to
serve its academic purposes. New
research, as long as it complies
with conservation rules, will be
permitted.

The land restoration is neces
sary, explained Carol Hoggs, di
rector of the Stanford Center for
Conservation Biology, because
the land has been heavily
overused.
