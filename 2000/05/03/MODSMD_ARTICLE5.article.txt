### DENNIS TYLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ixisi night, theASSU Undergraduate Senate validat
ed the presidential runoff'and certified this year's elec
tions.
Senator Ashok Redd) clarified that "validating the
runoff means that the senate feels the Elections Com
mission carried out the runoff as fairly as possible."
The Undergraduate Senate unanimously agreed
that the Elections Commission was lair under the rules
of the Campaign Practices Code. But there was much
heated debate on the effectiveness and enforcement of
the CPC rules.
Freshmen Jordan Connors and Sunaina Sinha and
junior Rajaie Batniji contested the elections because
they felt the Campaign Practices Code rules and regu
lations were not enforced.
"We would like a ruling that would reinforce the
penalties that were set in from the beginning and hope
that the CPC rules are taken more seriously and en
forced," said (lonnors.
The three students felt that some of the violations
that were committed by Platform for Accountability and
Change candidates gave the PAC candidates an unfair
advantage.
"The unsolicited e-mail violations gave PAC candi
dates more of an advantage that other students did not

have, because large amounts of e-mail encouraged stu
<let 11 sto vote for them, and that is clearly against the
rules of the CP('," said Connors.
fhe senate agreed that one of the major problems
with the Campaign Practices Code is the 48-hour rule,
which allows any violations made 48 hours before the
election to go without penalty.
"The current rules allow candidates to violate the
CPC rules and therefore should be changed," said ju
nior Katie Young, hearings committee officer.
I lie I ndergraduate Senate approves the Campaign
Practices ('.ode rules before thev are issued for elections,
and some senate members feel that the blame rests with
this year's senate for not taking more time developing
the rules lor the Campaign Practices Code.
" 11 lis embarrassing election is the senate's fault. I
stronglv feel that we should strike down those rules that
don't make sense and make new rules before next year's
senate enters the ASS I," said senit >r Adam Weiss, ASSU
pr< )gramining director.
Additionally, Weiss felt that junior Mike Levin,.-\SSL
president, should have taken a stronger role in solving
the problems during the elections.
"With all that has been going on with the ASSU elec
tic>ns. 1 think that the president of theASSI should have
stepped up and taken a stronger
leadership role within the ASSU,"
said Weiss." But his actions were not
a display of leadership."
Senator and Appropriations
Member Aimer Khan, a junior,
added that "a lot of senators have
l>een disillusioned by Levin's ac
tions. The fact that he encouraged
the Senate to approve the current
CPC rules and then went on to
bring [the code] into question to the
Constitutional Council indicates
that his actions were personally mo
tivated and were not in the best in
terests of the ASSU."
The Senate has decided to
change the CPC to prevent this
from happening again.
