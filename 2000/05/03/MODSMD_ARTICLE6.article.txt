This week, Cinco cle Mayo,
the most widely celebrated Mex
ican holiday in the United States,
is coming to Stanford.
El Centro Chicano, Casa Zap

ata and Familia de Stanford are
sponsoring a wide variety of cul
tural and s< H i;il events commem
orating Cinco de Mayo through
out the week.
"Every year, the (Ihicanoand
Mexican communities at Stan
lord come together lo com
memorate Canco de Mayo,"
said senior Jorge Man/ano, an
ethnic theme associate for Gasa
Zapata. "This year, we have
made the celebration larger
with all of the activities that
have been planned."

Cinco de Mayo honors the
day that a group of 3,000 to
4,000 Mexican and Indian
troops, led by General Ignacio
Zarago/a, defeated a 6,500-
man French army at the Battle
of Puebla in 1862.
According to Man/ano, the
significance of ( .inco de Mayo is
twofold for many Chicanos.
"First of all, it encapsulates
the spirit of struggle by fighting
against all odds," Man/ano said.
"Secondly, Cinco de Mayo com
memorates General Ignacio
Zaragoza, who was born in
Texas, as the first Chicano
hero."
The Cinco de Mayo festivities
are concentrated on Friday, the
actual date of the holiday.
At noon, Grito Serpentino,
San Jose's only spoken word
and music ensemble, will per
form in the Tresidder court
yard.
"Grito Serpentino is an
amazing music ensemble," said
senior Beatriz Garcia, program
coordinator for F.I Centro Chi
cano.
"By setting their poetry to
music, they demonstrate the
politics behind being a Chicano
in the United States."
The night will end with a
campus-wide party in the Casa
Zapata-Burbank courtyard,
starting at 9 p.m.
Although the holiday is over
on May 5, the celebration will
continue through the weekend.
On Saturday from noon to 2
p.m., Casa Zapata will hold a
carnival for all the members of

the Stanford community and its
neighboring areas.
According to Garcia, family
related carnivals are a good way
of celebrating Cinco de Mayo.
"There are a lot of miscon

ceptions about how Cinco de
Mayo is celebrated .... Cinco
de Mayo is a family holiday cel
ebrating the unity and patrio
tism of the Mexican people, " he
added.
