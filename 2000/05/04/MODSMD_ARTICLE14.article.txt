income. The affidavit said Van-
Meter asked for $1,000 — 2 per
cent of the $50,000.
Van Meter was released on his
own recognizance yesterday. He
and his attorney were not immedi

Federal prosecutor Joe Heaton
said no other arrests had been
made, but he would not say
whether any were pending.
Van Meter and seven other
Health Department workers were
suspended with pay as the investi
gation unfolded. Officials said the
other suspensions were not disci
plinary, but were ordered to allow
the probe to continue in their areas
without interference.
