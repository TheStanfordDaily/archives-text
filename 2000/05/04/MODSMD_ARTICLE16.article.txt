FRFFTOWN, Sierra Leone
(AP) — Fighting between rebels
and U.N. peacekeepers rebels
killed seven peacekeepers and
injured three others, officials said
yesterday as they tried to secure
the release of dozens of peace
keepers and military observers
seized by the rebels.
The violence was a major blow
to this West African nation's 112 rag
ile peace process.
Since Monday, the rebel Rev
olutionary United Front —
which remains, at least officially,
part of a power-sharing govern
ment created to end Sierra
Leone's civil war — has seized 50
U.N. workers in three towns,
officials said. The whereabouts of
many more workers remained
unclear.
The abductions and killings
came as the U.N. peacekeeping
force is taking charge of security
in the country. The force, which
numbers about 8,500, was dis
patched to replace a West
African intervention force known
as ECOMOG that defended the
government during eight years
of civil war. The last F.(X)M()(i
troops left the capital, Freetown,
this week.
Some L.N. officials were con
cerned that the abductions might
be a move by Foclav Sankoh, the
Revolutionary United Front
leader, to end the nearlv year-old
peace. Sankoh was brought into
the government last year, but he
recently has refused to talk to
government officials, including
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
"It seems as il Fodav Sankoh
is trying to derail the peace pro
cess," U.N. force commander
Maj. CiVn. Vijay Kumar |etlev
said.
His worries were echoed bv

Freetown's newspapers, mam ol
which have long feared rebel
plotting lo tr\ to seize powei.
Sankoh "lias sensed that the
peace process is becoming irre
versible and I Ins w ill not mean
well lot his diabolical plans." 1 lie

Dozens ol I .N. peacekeepers
were sin rounding Sankoh at his
home in Freetown while negotia
tions continued lor the release of
the I ,N. hostages,
I . N. ol lie ials said. Sierra
Lconcan officials said the home
was not l)cin<' surrounded as a

prelude to an arrest, but to make
sure the rebel leader was avail
able for discussions.
Nigeria was sending a delega
tion to press for the release of the
hostages, Nigerian Information
Minister Jerry Ghana said. In
addition, diplomats representing
the Economic Community of
West African States, the main
regional organization, were
expected in Freetown by today,
Sierra Leonean officials said.
Ihe clashes began Monday
when RUF rebels captured eight
U.N. military observers and
peacekeepers in Makeni after the
United Nations refused to return
10 former fighters who had
turned in their arms at a U.N.-
run disarmament center, officials
said. About 100 RUF fighters
surrounded the center and fired
shots in the air before capturing
the U.N. troops.
More peacekeepers and civil
ians were seized Tuesday in the
eastern town of Kailahun, a rebel
stronghold, U.N. officials said.
At least four of the dead
peacekeepers were Kenyans, a
L .N. official said on condition of
anonymity. The official said they
were killed during a gunbattle
after their post came under
heavy attack by rebels Tuesday
in Magburaka.
Philip Winslow, a spokesman
for the U.N. mission, said all
fighting in the country was over
by late Wednesday morning.
Reinforcements had been sent to
U.N. positions that have come
under rebel attack.
In New York, the U.N. Secu
rity Council and Secretary-Gen
eral Kofi Annan qpndemned the
deaths of the peacekeepers, and
both said much of the blame rest
ed with Sankoh.
