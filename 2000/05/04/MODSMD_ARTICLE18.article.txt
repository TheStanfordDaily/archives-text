# Metallica demands that Napster cut off users from online trading

SAN MATEO, Calif. (AP) — In the latest battle over
protecting music copyrights on the Internet, the
heavy-metal group Metallica demanded yesterday that
the online music service Napster cut off 317,000 users
who have illegally traded the band's songs.
Lars Ulrich, the band's drummer, and attorney
Howard King hand-delivered to Napster Inc.'s head
quarters 60,000 pages of names of people the band
says have been trading its songs online.
"If they want to steal Metallica's music, instead of
hiding behind their computers in their bedrooms and
dorm rooms, then just go down to Tower Records and
grab them off the shelves," Ulrich said.
Napster's software allows computer users to search
for songs online and download them directly from one
another's hard drives. Because Napster does not
directly provide the copyrighted music, it claims its ser
vice is legal.
Metallica is suing Napster in federal court to blcxk
its users from accessing the band's music via the com
pany's computer servers in San Mateo.
Napster said it may comply with the band's request
to remove users who continue to trade such popular
Metallica tunes as "The Unforgiven" and "Enter Sand
man."
Company spokesman Dan W(X)1 said yesterday that
the company would release a statement in response to
Metallica's action.
Metallica encourages fans to record Ixxjtlegs of its
concerts, but the band's members drew a distinction
between live recordings and the high-quality digital

copies of its studio recordings being traded on the
Internet.
"We are going after Napster, the main artery,"
Metallica singer and guitarist James I letfield explained
Tuesday in an online chat session.
He said the band's fans are breaking the law, bin
"we are not going after individual fans. Metallica has
always felt fans are family."
The band says the violations of its copyrighted
material were monitored and logged by NetlM), a com
puter consulting firm that found thousands of Napster
users making Metallica songs available last weekend.
Metallica thrust itself into the music-download con
troversy on April 13, when it became the first band to
sue Napster.
The federal lawsuit filed in Los Angeles accused
Napster of copyright infringement and racketeering
and also named three universities that allowed stu
dents to access Napster through their servers.
Two of the schools, Yale University and Indiana
University, were dropped from the suit after they
bl<x keel student access to Napster's Web servers.
The University of Southern California was also
dropped after saying it would permit students to access
Napster "only for demonstrably legal purposes," such
as chat rooms.
Other schools, such as Northwestern University,
have banned Napster for another reason — because it
is so popular that it clogged their computer networks.
Not all musicians agree with Metallica's hard
stance on online music trading.

The controversy over Napster is far from new. Rick Fletcher, 20, a junior majoring in computer science at Kutztown
University in Reno, has helped organize a protest of university bans on Napster.
