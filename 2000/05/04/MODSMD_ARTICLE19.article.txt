## MODERN LIFE IS RUBBISH A 						wave of protests 
### 
Inevitably, the current Justice for
Janitors fracas hasn't ended with
the janitors. Inspired by the jani
tors' strike in Los Angeles, various
other unions have jumped on the band
wagon to demand a bigger piece of the
pie.
(•roups currently striking, or threat
ening to strike, include the New York
City police department, UC grad stu
dents and most recently the Screen

Actors Guild and
American Federation
of 1 elevision and
Radio Artists — that
is, actors in television
commercials. I laving
decided they aren't
getting paid enough
to appear on our
screens for seconds
to hawk pizza and toi
let paper, they com-

menced their walkout Monday with
demonstrations in Los Angeles, New
York, San Francisco and Chicago.
Local lights have turned out in sup
port, including San Francisco mayor
Willie Blown, who is a member of the
guild by virtue of his cameos in Disney's
"George of the Jungle," among other
cinematic classics. He spoke to riotous
applause at the San Francisco demon
stration, comparing the actors' plight to
that of the Los Angeles janitors and
assuring them that the advertising cor
porations would be brought "to their
knees."
Ac tors and janitors: it's hard to imag
ine two more different groups of peo
ple. Most of the time we act as though
the janitors simply don't exist, as
ihough the dorms and auditoriums
somehow get cleaned by themselves.
We're certainly never inclined to envy
them, whereas envy is essentially what
television commercials are all about.
I he actors in these commercials are
the Beautiful People. They get paid to
flounce around on our screens and con
vince us with their bright eyes, clear
skin and dentifrice-whitened smiles
that we too can be Beautiful People —
so long as our faces belong to Noxzema,
or we come home to Anderson or some
body says Mc Donald's. A subset of the
Beautiful People constitutes the Wacky
People, whose carefree antics suggest a
liberation from social mores that we too
can achieve by dialing 1-800-COL
LFCT.
Ii goes without saying that the logic
is ludicrous, and it also goes without
saying that it works. I his lends a deli
cious irony to the demonstrators' chant
"Hey ho, hey ho, corporate greed has

got to go." They're perfectly aware of
their complicity in this corporate greed,
helping to sell the implied message that
life-changing epiphanies can be
brought about by a facial cleanser.
Favorite Stanford son Tiger Woods
joined in the strike on Tuesday by
refusing to shoot a scheduled TV spot
for Nike. Actors' guild spokesman Greg
Krizman greeted the decision with
enthusiasm, declaring that Woods
"stands together with the working class
SAG and AFTRA performers who
depend on a fail commercials contract
to maintain a decent standard of life."
Sounds noble. But one wonders
what the people who spend 14 hours a
clay making shoes in Indonesia would
say about Nike and standards of life.
It all comes down to entitlement; the
recent Nasdaq jitters notwithstanding,
everyone has the sense of being in a
boom economy, and everyone feels
they deserve a bigger share. The actors
note that on average, their salaries
make up only two percent of the adver
tising budget; advertisers counter with
the claim that the actors' demands
would increase the production cost of
commercials by 350 percent.
It's hard to say whose case is better
grounded in financial reality. But
doubtless some compromise will be
reached, since in the end the show has
to go on. Aside from the expense the
strike will incur for the advertisers, the
idea of television actors lighting for
money undercuts the whole implicit
logic behind television commercials.
We're not meant to see the ac tors as
actors; they're presented as people like
us, with the crucial difference that their
lives have been enhanced by the prod
uct in question.
To see them struggling with financial
woes highlights the fact that once the
shoot is over, the Beautiful People still
have to go home and pay their rent and
phone bill. And using Noxzema or
Crest won't help them out at all.
In the meantime advertisers have
pledged to go on shooting commer
cials, using actors from outside the
guild. Which brings the embattled jan
itors to mind; as long as they're strik
ing too, why not let them sit in for the
Beautiful People?
Naturally it'll never happen. But
wouldn't it be refreshing to turn on
the television and see a man with a
mop and bucket mugging for the c am
era, asking us where we want to go
today?
