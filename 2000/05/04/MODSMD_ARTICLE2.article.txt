# Commercial development, new stores revitalize East Palo Alto
## Ground Breaking 
### AMY L. KOVAC CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Editor's Note .'Today's story is the third in a weekly series ex
amining the issues and conflicts that have shaped Stan
ford's relationships with the local communities. This week,
we continue our coverage of East Palo Alto Iry looking at
redevelopment efforts in the city.

As tractors and cranes demolish the buildings in
the area of East Palo Alto formerly known as
Whiskey Gulch, the oft-struggling community is
launching a new era of commercial growth

The Whiskey
Gulch area, re
cently renamed
University Circle,
had been the

home of small shops, liquor stores and several non
profit organizations serving mostly residents of East
Palo Alto. By 2004 it will be fully transformed, with
the construction of three large off ice buildings and a
full-service hotel.
This venture is the second of three major devel
opment projects in East Palo Alto, according to Ri
cardo Noguera, redevelopment manager for the
city.
"Our mission is to redevelop blighted areas, to
generate much-needed revenue for the city's tax
base and to employ local residents," Noguera said.
"Between 80 and 100 units, mainly apartments,
had to be relocated," Noguera said. "Because of re
location benefits, some people were able to buy
homes in the greater Bay Area."
However, only a small percentage of them were
able to find new housing in East Palo Alto, reinforc
ing the concerns of many on the Peninsula that the
new developments have hurt many of the city's
lower-income residents.
Most small businesses in Whiskey Gulch decided
to close rather than move, though almost all of the
non-profit groups have found new locations.
The Ecumenical Hunger Program, an organiza
tion that provides food and clothing to families and
individuals in need, was one of the non-profits that
was forced to find a new home.
"It was a difficult process," said Maleah Choi, the
program's office manager. "We had to shut down
our services for a couple of weeks in order to move."
The program relocated to 1836 Bay Road, the
site of a former warehouse that was renovated by a
city-funded architect to fit its needs. During the
move, they were only able to help people with emer
gencies, but they did receive donations during the
construction of their new building.
"It is a beautiful location. They have worked hard
to make this a nice place for us," Choi said. "But,

only when escrow goes through
can we say that this has been suc
cessful."
The first of the city's major re
development projects was (late
way 101, which is located just of 112
Highway 101. The complex,
which includes Home Depot,
Office Depot, Ihe Good Guys
and I aco Bell, was the first large
commercial development in East
Palo Alto since it incorporated in
1983.
In addition to the retail stores,
the Gateway 101 project will
eventually house a cafe, credit
union and sandwich shop, as well
as 217 single family homes and
I :U) townhouses. The Swedish
furniture company IKKA and the
electronics superstore Best Buy
are finalizing deals with the city to
move into the complex as well.
"Once the sound wall came
down, the visibility of this area
was greatly improved," said
Noguera. "Many more business
es have been drawn to this site
now that it is visible. Retailers

have been banging on our door.
"Most employees in the stores
are from East Palo Alto,"
Noguera said. "We have worked
with the businesses to hire and
train local residents."
Of the 217 homes that are
being built, 22 of them will be re
served for below market-rate
home buyers and half of the new
townhouse apartments will be
available at below market-rate
rents.
(ierald Certe/.a, store manager
for Office Depot, confirmed that
many of his employees live in East
Palo Alto.
"About 95 percent of our asso
ciates are East Palo Alto residents
and it has worked out great,"
Gerte/.a said. "Moving into East
Palo Alto was a key move for Of
fice Depot because there is noth
ing else like us in East Palo Alto."
I lie final development project
on the city's agenda is the Eour
Gorners/ Ravenswood Industri
al Area, near the current location
of City Hall.
"This area will become the
new downtown," said Noguera.
"We want it to become a one-stop
shop for civic and community ac -
tivities."
