Editor's Note .'Today's story is the third in a weekly series ex
amining the issues and conflicts that have shaped Stan
ford's relationships with the local communities. This week,
we continue our coverage of East Palo Alto Iry looking at
redevelopment efforts in the city.

As tractors and cranes demolish the buildings in
the area of East Palo Alto formerly known as
Whiskey Gulch, the oft-struggling community is
launching a new era of commercial growth

The Whiskey
Gulch area, re
cently renamed
University Circle,
had been the

home of small shops, liquor stores and several non
profit organizations serving mostly residents of East
Palo Alto. By 2004 it will be fully transformed, with
the construction of three large off ice buildings and a
full-service hotel.
This venture is the second of three major devel

cardo Noguera, redevelopment manager for the
city.
"Our mission is to redevelop blighted areas, to
generate much-needed revenue for the city's tax
base and to employ local residents," Noguera said.
"Between 80 and 100 units, mainly apartments,
had to be relocated," Noguera said. "Because of re
location benefits, some people were able to buy
homes in the greater Bay Area."
However, only a small percentage of them were
able to find new housing in East Palo Alto, reinforc
ing the concerns of many on the Peninsula that the
new developments have hurt many of the city's
lower-income residents.
Most small businesses in Whiskey Gulch decided
to close rather than move, though almost all of the
non-profit groups have found new locations.
The Ecumenical Hunger Program, an organiza
tion that provides food and clothing to families and
individuals in need, was one of the non-profits that
was forced to find a new home.
"It was a difficult process," said Maleah Choi, the
program's office manager. "We had to shut down
our services for a couple of weeks in order to move."
The program relocated to 1836 Bay Road, the
site of a former warehouse that was renovated by a
city-funded architect to fit its needs. During the
move, they were only able to help people with emer
gencies, but they did receive donations during the
construction of their new building.
"It is a beautiful location. They have worked hard
to make this a nice place for us," Choi said. "But,
