# FROM APATHY TO ACTIVISM
## The
						perils of genetic engineering 
### MARTHA ROBERTS GUEST COLUMNIST 
Apples with fish genes in them. Toma
toes with a few bacterial genes stuck in
them. Information about genetic engi
neering has rarely gotten beyond this
sensationalist category of hype in the
United States, and Americans, with their
indomitable faith in science, have usually
yawned and flipped the newspaper page
whenever an informative article appears.
Kuropeans, however, are heavily edu
cated about the growing seed industry
that does genetic research to implant cer
tain specific genetic traits from any sort of
plant, animal or bacteria into innocent
farm crops. And Europeans are furious.
'They stomp on biotech research plots
dressed up as mutant broccoli; they
protest Monsanto and Novartis, two
prominent producers of biotech seeds, as
spreaders of genetic pestilence. Hut most
importantly, they refuse to allow their
nations to produce or import genetically
engineered crops.
Why are Kuropeans so angry? What is
this information that they know and that
frightens them?
Barely 10 years ago, genetic
researchers began taking genetic material

including the helpful trait from any
organism and implanting the I)NA into
vegetables. They created crops with pi e
added preservative for longer shelf lives,
or crops resistant to herbicide, so that
entire fields could be sprayed en ma,sse
without killing the crop.
The food and Drug Administration
speedily approved these entirely new
crops, with no genetic relatives anywhere
in nature and genetically engineered
varieties now account for the vast majori
ty of seeds grown for many crops. Their
increasing prevalence means a startling
decrease in the genetic diversity of farm
crops. And as any Hum Bio major knows,
decreasing genetic diversity exponential
ly increases the opportunity for
ances of disastrous diseases and pests.
Moreover, because biotech foods were
inadequately tested before being put to
widespread use, there is the potential for
them to cross-pollinate with wild relatives
of farm crops. There are already exam
ples of genetically modified wild mustard
seed appearing in Canada next to farm
lands growing biotech rapeseed, a mem
ber of the mustard family. Organic farms
located next to areas where genetically
modified crops are raised have turned up
crops with these unnaturally added traits.

The genetic independence of our planet
is at risk, with the possibility of genetifc
pollution, of cross-pollinated superweeds
taking over.
T he other great fear regarding biotech
.crops is the concern of what some newly
added traits may do to the environ rrf«fit.
One of the most popular genetically nlbd
ified products is the line of crops includ
ed genes from a pesticidal bacteria, Bacil
lus thuringiensis. This pesticide, f>to
duced by bacteria in a form that is £w)ly
activated when ingested, has been activat
ed by genetic modification so tha('is
doesn't need to be eaten to be deadly. Ini
tial research has shown that these new Bt
crops harm insects indiscriminately in
their local areas, killing beneficial insects!
like ladybugs and lacewings as well as
pests that lower crop yields.
The main danger of genetic engineer
ing is consequences we don't even know
about. These new crops manipulate
Nature in a new, intensively invasive
manner, yet the FDA rapidly approved
these revolutionary products without suf
ficient testing to monitor the long-term
effects of biotech crops on genetic drift,
local insect populations and ecosystem
