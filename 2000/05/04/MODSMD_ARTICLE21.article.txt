# FROM APATHY TO ACTIVISM
## The 						perils of genetic engineering 
### MARTHA ROBERTS GUEST COLUMNIST 
Apples with fish genes in them. Toma
toes with a few bacterial genes stuck in
them. Information about genetic engi
neering has rarely gotten beyond this
sensationalist category of hype in the
United States, and Americans, with their
indomitable faith in science, have usually
yawned and flipped the newspaper page
whenever an informative article appears.
Kuropeans, however, are heavily edu
cated about the growing seed industry
that does genetic research to implant cer
tain specific genetic traits from any sort of
plant, animal or bacteria into innocent
farm crops. And Europeans are furious.
'They stomp on biotech research plots
dressed up as mutant broccoli; they
protest Monsanto and Novartis, two
prominent producers of biotech seeds, as
spreaders of genetic pestilence. Hut most
importantly, they refuse to allow their
nations to produce or import genetically
engineered crops.
Why are Kuropeans so angry? What is
this information that they know and that
frightens them?
Barely 10 years ago, genetic
researchers began taking genetic material

including the helpful trait from any
organism and implanting the I)NA into
vegetables. They created crops with pi e
added preservative for longer shelf lives,
or crops resistant to herbicide, so that
entire fields could be sprayed en ma,sse
without killing the crop.
The food and Drug Administration
speedily approved these entirely new
crops, with no genetic relatives anywhere
in nature and genetically engineered
varieties now account for the vast majori
ty of seeds grown for many crops. Their
increasing prevalence means a startling
decrease in the genetic diversity of farm
crops. And as any Hum Bio major knows,
decreasing genetic diversity exponential
ly increases the opportunity for
ances of disastrous diseases and pests.
Moreover, because biotech foods were
inadequately tested before being put to
widespread use, there is the potential for
them to cross-pollinate with wild relatives
of farm crops. There are already exam
ples of genetically modified wild mustard
seed appearing in Canada next to farm
lands growing biotech rapeseed, a mem
ber of the mustard family. Organic farms
located next to areas where genetically
modified crops are raised have turned up
crops with these unnaturally added traits.

The genetic independence of our planet
is at risk, with the possibility of genetifc
pollution, of cross-pollinated superweeds
taking over.
T he other great fear regarding biotech
.crops is the concern of what some newly
added traits may do to the environ rrf«fit.
One of the most popular genetically nlbd
ified products is the line of crops includ
ed genes from a pesticidal bacteria, Bacil
lus thuringiensis. This pesticide, f>to
duced by bacteria in a form that is £w)ly
activated when ingested, has been activat
ed by genetic modification so tha('is
doesn't need to be eaten to be deadly. Ini
tial research has shown that these new Bt
crops harm insects indiscriminately in
their local areas, killing beneficial insects!
like ladybugs and lacewings as well as
pests that lower crop yields.
The main danger of genetic engineer
ing is consequences we don't even know
about. These new crops manipulate
Nature in a new, intensively invasive
manner, yet the FDA rapidly approved
these revolutionary products without suf
ficient testing to monitor the long-term
effects of biotech crops on genetic drift,
local insect populations and ecosystem
viability. The potential for unknown dis
astrous consequences is frighteningly
high, and the potential to reverse inbred
genetic pollution is infinitesimally small.
...Weak arguments for genetic engi
neering claim that they will reduce pesti
cide dependence and increase food
yields. The former argument is untrue
— most new crops either produce their
own pesticides, like the Bt crops, or are
genetically engineered to be resistant to
pesticides, meaning that chemicals can
be mechanically sprayed over the entire
field rather carefully and specifically
only onto weeds — and the second irrel
evant to America, since we already have

a troublesome grain surplus that is low
ering food prices and driving farmers
into bankruptcy.
The best argument for genetically
engineered crops is the opportunity they
present to help people with insecure
food supplies. In developing nations,
some farmers live off 60 cents a day. (>iv
ing these farmers seeds genetically mod
ified to resist drought or increase yields
can give these poorest of the poor the
opportunity to survive and even pull
themselves out of poverty. Also, genetic
engineering can modify seeds so that
they produce crops fortified with vita
mins. Millions of impoverished children
develop night-blindness every year
because they lack a good source of vita
min A in their diets. The potential to
help the Third World is real and cannot
be ignored.

Of course, protesting Monsanto and
Novartis will have no ill effect on these
humanitarian actions. There is no
money in producing a miracle crop for
the Third World, so the vast majority of
humanitarian genetic engineering is
done by not-for-profit organizations.
In nn opinion, the vast majority of
genetic engineering, which is done to
increase yields and profit margins for
industrial, large-scale American farms, is
an irresponsible and incalculably dan
gerous game of toying with nature with
out any clear idea of the consequences.
Biotech companies are releasing entirely
new, untested species onto our earth to
make a lew extra dollars. While some
may use the potential to help developing
nations ;is an excuse to release biological
pollution across America, the two issues
are obviouslv only weakly related. The

condition of poor subsistence farmers in
developing nations is such that activists
from wealthy nations have no right to
make decisions regarding humanitarian
genetic engineering for them. However,
American consumers do have the right
to choose what they are eating. Ameri
can genetic engineering, the idea of
manipulating and mining Nature to
extract a few more dollars from our soil,
is greedy, reckless and perilous.
So what can you do to help?
First of all, vote with your dollars.
Farmers will only grow what can be sold,
and if there is no demand for genetical
ly engineered crops, they will stop grow
ing biotech seeds. Of course, food that
includes genetically modified crops isn't
labeled, so the only way to protect your
self is to go organic.
Secondly, write or call your represen

tative and senators, demanding labeling
for foods containing genetically engi
neered crops. Biotech corporations are
lobbying to ensure that American con
sumers stay in the dark about what they
are eating, but this secrecy restricts your
right to be an educated, conscious con
sumer.
Thirdly, get active on campus.
Tomorrow, the Redwood Action Team
at Stanford is having a biotech crop
teach-in at 2:15 p.m. in White Plaza.
Come and learn more about the issues
and about what you can do.

Martha Roberts is a 112 reshman at Stanford,

Her interests include local hiking and canoeing
trips, serving for the Drama Department's Cos
tume Shop, and being involved in environmen
tal activism on campus.

So what can you do to help?
First of all, vote with your dollars.
Farmers will only grow what can be sold,
and if there is no demand for genetical
ly engineered crops, they will stop grow
ing biotech seeds. Of course, food that
includes genetically modified crops isn't
labeled, so the only way to protect your
self is to go organic.
Secondly, write or call your represen

tative and senators, demanding labeling
for foods containing genetically engi
neered crops. Biotech corporations are
lobbying to ensure that American con
sumers stay in the dark about what they
are eating, but this secrecy restricts your
right to be an educated, conscious con
sumer.
Thirdly, get active on campus.

Apples with fish genes in them. Toma
toes with a few bacterial genes stuck in
them. Information about genetic engi
neering has rarely gotten beyond this
sensationalist category of hype in the
United States, and Americans, with their
indomitable faith in science, have usually
yawned and flipped the newspaper page
whenever an informative article appears.
Kuropeans, however, are heavily edu
cated about the growing seed industry
that does genetic research to implant cer
tain specific genetic traits from any sort of
plant, animal or bacteria into innocent
farm crops. And Europeans are furious.
'They stomp on biotech research plots
dressed up as mutant broccoli; they
protest Monsanto and Novartis, two
prominent producers of biotech seeds, as
spreaders of genetic pestilence. Hut most
importantly, they refuse to allow their
nations to produce or import genetically
engineered crops.
Why are Kuropeans so angry? What is
this information that they know and that
frightens them?
Barely 10 years ago, genetic
researchers began taking genetic material

including the helpful trait from any
organism and implanting the I)NA into
vegetables. They created crops with pi e
added preservative for longer shelf lives,
or crops resistant to herbicide, so that
entire fields could be sprayed en ma,sse
without killing the crop.
The food and Drug Administration
speedily approved these entirely new
crops, with no genetic relatives anywhere
in nature and genetically engineered
varieties now account for the vast majori
ty of seeds grown for many crops. Their
increasing prevalence means a startling
decrease in the genetic diversity of farm
crops. And as any Hum Bio major knows,
decreasing genetic diversity exponential
ly increases the opportunity for
ances of disastrous diseases and pests.
Moreover, because biotech foods were
inadequately tested before being put to
widespread use, there is the potential for
them to cross-pollinate with wild relatives
of farm crops. There are already exam
ples of genetically modified wild mustard
seed appearing in Canada next to farm
lands growing biotech rapeseed, a mem
ber of the mustard family. Organic farms
located next to areas where genetically
modified crops are raised have turned up
crops with these unnaturally added traits.

The genetic independence of our planet
is at risk, with the possibility of genetifc
pollution, of cross-pollinated superweeds
taking over.
T he other great fear regarding biotech
.crops is the concern of what some newly
added traits may do to the environ rrf«fit.
One of the most popular genetically nlbd
ified products is the line of crops includ
ed genes from a pesticidal bacteria, Bacil
lus thuringiensis. This pesticide, f>to
duced by bacteria in a form that is £w)ly
activated when ingested, has been activat
ed by genetic modification so tha('is
doesn't need to be eaten to be deadly. Ini
tial research has shown that these new Bt
crops harm insects indiscriminately in
their local areas, killing beneficial insects!
like ladybugs and lacewings as well as
pests that lower crop yields.
The main danger of genetic engineer
ing is consequences we don't even know
about. These new crops manipulate
Nature in a new, intensively invasive
manner, yet the FDA rapidly approved
these revolutionary products without suf
ficient testing to monitor the long-term
effects of biotech crops on genetic drift,
local insect populations and ecosystem
viability. The potential for unknown dis
astrous consequences is frighteningly
high, and the potential to reverse inbred
genetic pollution is infinitesimally small.
...Weak arguments for genetic engi
neering claim that they will reduce pesti
cide dependence and increase food
yields. The former argument is untrue
— most new crops either produce their
own pesticides, like the Bt crops, or are
genetically engineered to be resistant to
pesticides, meaning that chemicals can
be mechanically sprayed over the entire
field rather carefully and specifically
only onto weeds — and the second irrel
evant to America, since we already have

a troublesome grain surplus that is low
ering food prices and driving farmers
into bankruptcy.
The best argument for genetically
engineered crops is the opportunity they
present to help people with insecure
food supplies. In developing nations,
some farmers live off 60 cents a day. (>iv
ing these farmers seeds genetically mod
ified to resist drought or increase yields
can give these poorest of the poor the
opportunity to survive and even pull
themselves out of poverty. Also, genetic
engineering can modify seeds so that
they produce crops fortified with vita
mins. Millions of impoverished children
develop night-blindness every year
because they lack a good source of vita
min A in their diets. The potential to
help the Third World is real and cannot
be ignored.
