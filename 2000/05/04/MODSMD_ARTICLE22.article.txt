# A
						call for all kinds of faith within the Stanford community

### PETER DOUGLAS GUEST COLUMNIST 
Dostoevsky attests that the degree of a
society's civilization can be judged by the
treatment of its prisoners. I'm sure that,
regarding the majority of societies
throughout history, we could draw such
an analogy. However, if we would, for a
moment, isolate our analysis to the Stan
ford community, in which such an analo
gy could be created only through
metaphor, we might be forced to reckon
a different approach to judging our own
community's civilization.
Unless we take a rather Hamlet-esque
perspective on our collective existence
and delve into the realm of such state
ments as " I here is nothing either good
or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it
(the world and Denmark) is a prison," we
must find a more modern litmus test.
What I ask is: How can we judge the
degree of civilization in our own commu
nity of 23,000? The numbers aren't much
different from the size of communities
about which Dostoevsky must have pon-

dered. What has
changed is that we live
in a privileged space —
yet there are just as
striking problems with
our community as
there were with Dosto
evski's.
For example, I dis
covered through a

recent near tragedy (one of my best
friends attempted suicide) that there is
approximately one attempted suicide on
campus every week. Perhaps I'm just out
of touch with "reality," but this number
strikes me as rather high, particularly in
an organization whose very existence
depends on and indicates a relatively
advanced civilization.
With the idea of suicide in mind, let's
return to Hamlet and assume that he's
contemplating suicide during the "To be
or not to be" soliloquy. As he resolves
philosophically not to commit suicide, he
says that "conscience does make cowards
of us all" and that "the native hue of res
olution / Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast

of thought" (111, i, Arden). The Arden
Shakespeare, corroborated by the
Oxford English Dictionary, draws our
attention to two interpretations of the
word "conscience": "the inner voice of
moral judgment" (the more modern def
inition) and"the faculty of knowing and
understanding." I prefer the latter the
atrically, but what interests me is the idea
that reason is the controlling force
between unbridled emotion and suicide
and keeps the pained person from end
ing his or her life. If you will accept this
perspective for the moment, then I ask
what prevents many, far less intellectual
individuals from choosing the "bare bod
kin?" And conversely, what leads individ
uals living in an environment like Stan
ford, in which conscience has achieved a
historical high, to attempt suicide?
As I've considered this over the past 10
days, I've been struck by the particularly
religious atmosphere of the moment.
With both Christians and Jews at an
annual religious crux, the religious activ
ity on campus has been more obvious
than usual. However, when I think about

it, despite tlie fact that Stanford's popula
tion describes itself as largely religious,
the spiritual aspects of the Stanford com
munity are vastly silent. From my own
experience living all over campus and
being involved in all sorts of organiza
tions, there seems to be an unspoken
taboo about both individual and commu
nity spirituality — and an even more
charged word — faith.
Paul Tillich, a prominent Christian
theologian, defines faith, in part, as "the
state of being ultimately concerned," as
essentially human, and as dynamic as its
possible focuses ("The Dynamics of
Faith"). Tillich argues that humanity is
defined as much by faith, whether it be
faith in a god, a person, an idea, a
rial consideration, or anything else, as
humanity is defined by its conscience. He
argues that, as much as the absence of
reason, the absence of faith takes away
our humanity. If you'll accept this for a
moment, then I would like to suggest that
Stanford's suicide statistics indicate not of
a lack of conscience, but an absence of
community support for and openness

about faith to buttress reason s disinte-i
gration. At Stanford many of us rely so!
heavily on intellect, and hide away our
faith to such an extent, that the break
down of our reason in the face of over
whelming pain can more easily leave us
defenseless at the impulse to self-destruct,
even at the impulse to die.
Returning to my original question, l
how should we judge the degree of civi
lization in our own small community? I
say that the degree of openness about]
faith and spirituality is directly propor
tional to the degree of civilization, and
presently, Stanford is virtually barbaric.
So what do I suggest? I'm not arguing l
for religion, but for an openness of faith.!
I suggest that we all, whatever our indi-1
vidual faiths, discuss these ultimate con
cerns with our close friends, for at least
they (if no one else) should know in what
we put our trust and hope — what ulti-I
mately concerns us.
