Hacking incident at Mitchell
Four computers in the Mitchell Earth Sci
ences building were accessed by a hacker
sometime Thursday night.
Files and software were deleted from com
puters in two workstations and two adjoining
offices in the Dean's Office.
The destroyed information was administra
tive and was saved on the individual comput

ers. Lt. Del Bandy said that nearly all the in
formation was recovered.
The incident is under investigation by the
computer security office. It is not clear
whether the act was committed remotely or in

Students arrested for trespassing in
private pool
Police arrested two students on charges of
trespassing and resisting arrest around 3 a.m.
Monday morning and cited and released a
third student for trespassing.
Police responded to a call from a resident of
Pierce Mitchell Houses complaining of loud
voices heard near the pool. Police arrived on
the scene to find four people in the private
pool, three of whom fled.
Police tracked clown juniors Casey Kauff
man and Alexandra Thorson and arrested
and cited them both for trespassing and resist
ing arrest.'Hie student that did not run was re
leased and was not cited at that time.
The fourth party escaped. The students
claimed that he was in the pool when they ar

rived and that they did not know him.
Sergeant Karp said that the area was post
ed with "no trespassing" signs and that the
pool is also closed after 10 p.m.
" That's private property over there," Karp
said. "You are committing a criminal trespass
if you go past that fence." He said that enter
ing the pool at Peter Coutts residences and en
tering the Stanford pool after hours are also
trespassing offenses.
If a student does choose to trespass, Karp
said, "Don't run. That just makes it worse. In
the scheme of things, trespassing is relatively
minor."
I respassing and resisting an arrest are both
classified as misdemeanors, but the latter is
treated as a more serious offense.
Although alcohol did not appear to be in
volved in this case, Karp said that police are
concerned about students trespassing on
pools at night when they have been drinking.
Karp said that intoxication can cause a person
to lose their orientation and swim downwards
instead of upwards, increasing the risk of
drowning.
