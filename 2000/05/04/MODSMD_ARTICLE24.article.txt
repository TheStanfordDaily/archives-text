"Her mouth dropped open, she
couldn't say anything. She said I know
this wouldn't be like you, but this isn't a
joke, is it?' She was really quite
shocked."
That's how Christine Griffith, associate
dean of graduate student life, remembers
Elizabeth Hiyama's reaction when she
found out she was one of three winners of
the tenth annual Amy J. Blue Award for
stafl excellence. 1 liyama is an associate di
rector of Residential Education.
I lie other two winners are I lerb (iraw
ert, who works as maintenance leader in
Student Housing Services, and Imelda
White, administrator in the Office for Re
ligious Life.

"1 am delight
ed and very hon
ored, very hon
ored indeed,"
White said. "I
knew nothing at
all about it until
the committee
stepped into my
office."
Griffith, who
is a former Blue

Award recipient herself, sat on the award
committee. With the other nine members,
she sifted through the 430 separate nomi
nations for 73 Stanford staff members.
"We read every nomination submitted,
and then get together and think about the
qualities the award is based on," she said.

The award is for
"employees who
exemplify dedi
cation to accom
plishment, com
mitment to peo
ple and enthusi
asm."
One of those
nominations was
from Frank Klab
erdanz, supervi-

sor of the trades maintenance shop, who
nominated Grawert. "He's my 37-year
veteran here. 1 le's a wonderful guy, hut
he's one of those really humble sorts."
When asked to comment on his honor,
Grawert said, "1 think they made a mis
take â€” I feel other people deserve it

more." And when
it was pointed out
that his supervi
sor felt different
ly, Grawert
replied with a
laugh, "He just
wants to get more
work out of me."
ft that's true,
klaber d a n r.

doesn't have
much time left. Grawert plans to retire at
the end of this year. Next year, many of
his duties will be taken over by his 42-
year-old son, Jorg, a Stanford employee
of 13 years. "He'll be better, younger
and better-looking," said the elder
Grawert.

The three winners will be honored in a<
ceremony on May 22 in the Amy Blue
Garden at 655 Serra Street.
The garden and the award are named
after Amy J. lilue, a former associate vice
president for administrative services and
facilities who died in May 1988.
The award is funded by an endowment
created by her friends, family and col
leagues, and supported by the Kenneth
M. Cuthbertson Fund and Human Re
sources Services.
Blue was, according to Hiyama, "a
pretty amazing lady ... so positive and so
energetic .... The way I remember her is
with this incredible smile and these in
credible bright eyes. She was a real go-get
ter ... so to be able to win this award on
her behalf is overwhelming."
