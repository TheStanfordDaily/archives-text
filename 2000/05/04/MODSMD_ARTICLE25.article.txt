## Fire, experience guide Keever in quest for crown 
### MATT McQUINN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
She's putted with the best at the
U.S. Women's Open and chipped
her way to the quarterfinals in the
U.S. Women's Amateur. This
summer, she'll lead a group of
American amateurs into a cross-
Atlantic showdown in England.
But nothing is bigger for
Stephanie Keever right now than
shooting Stanford into contention
for a national championship.
Keever, a junior standout on
the Cardinal women's golf team,
will look to help lift her team to a
berth in the NCAA Champi
onships May 11 inTempe,Ariz.,at
thje NCAA West Regional. And she
can't wait.
"I really like the adrenaline of
being there and having to hit the
big shot," Keever said. "You have
to love it to be able to play in these
competitions."
As one of the top golfers in the
nation, Keever has contributed to
the Stanford golf team's unprece
dented recent success in her three
years on the Farm. Amongst her
numerous contributions, her third
place finish at the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championship last year
led the Cardinal to its first-ever
title in a league that boasts six of
the,tap 10 teams m the country.

This year, her consistent play
helped Stanford to a No. 6 rank
ing and a second-place finish at the
Pac-10 Championships last week.
The two-time Second-ream
All-American's play has been noth
ing short of phenomenal. Starting
in her junior year of high school,
she qualified to play in the U.S.
Women's Open. The following
year, she reached the quarterfinals
in the U.S. Women's Amateur.
In June Keever and teammate
Hillary Homeyer will travel to
North Yorkshire, England, to rep
resent the United States in the
Curtis Cup, as part of a team made
up of the top eight amateur
women in the nation — an accom
plishment that few college juniors
can boast.
Keever, ranked No. 14 among
college golfers, has even led the
highly competitive Cardinal team
in stroke average for the past two
years, and last year led the nation
in par-5 scoring, averaging 4.81.
This season, Keever lias contin
ued to be a threat to the competi
tion. While she has yet to win a
tournament, she has been lurking
around the leaders, firing low
scores for the Clardinal. I fer finish
es include fourth at the Southern
Methodist University / Ohio State
I Diversity Regional Challenge
and third .it the Ihlanfeldt Invita
tion.
Still, one player's pla\ cannot
determine the late of an entire
team. Keever does more than
shoot low scores for the ('ardinal.
I lei approach to the game in
spires her teammates.
"Stephanie realh motivates me
because she works so hard and is
so dedicated in her practice," said
freshman teammate Kim Kowton.
()ther team members agree.
"Stephanie is always positive,"
senior |ae(ean Ro said. "Even il
her round doesn't start off well,
she maintains a positive alti
tude."
In addition to being a role
model and a team leader, Keevei
epilomi/es the ideal of a scholar
athlete. She graduated from

Ciinarron-Meinorial 11 i.ull School
in Las Vegas with a 4.4 CPA and
has si net* earned an All-Academic
honorable mention in the l'ac-10.
fo maintain academics while
having Lo practice everyday and to
take midterms on the load is quite
exceptional.
I his is especially true in golf, a
game that requires incredible fine
tuning to compete at its highest
levels. Still, the sociology major
has succeeded in balancing ac ade
mics <ind athletics.
Keever must continue this bal
ancing act lor the next several
weeks .is the team advances deep
into postseason competition.
II the Cardinal plays well
enough in Tempe to advance, it
will earn a spot in the national
championship match May 24-27
in Sunßiver, ()re.
I ler teammates look lor Keever
to lead them to Sunßiver.
"Stephanie plays with a lot of

Kowton said. "She wants to go out
and win every time."
