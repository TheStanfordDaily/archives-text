## 
### ELISSA KESZLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The red-hot Stanford women's
water polo team will take to the
pool in Indianapolis, Incl., this
weekend and attempt to bring
home its first national champi
onship.
No. 1 Stanford (25-4) enters
play Friday as the tournament's
top seed. After three straight trips
to the national semifinals — in
cluding a loss in the title game last
year — the Cardinal believes this is
its year to break through.
"It all comes down to this week
end," freshman goalie Jackie
Frank said. " This is what we've
been training for and this is where
we all make it happen."
Stanford must win four in a row
to claim the championship. In its
first game, the Cardinal will face
No. 18 Harvard, with the winner
of the Hawaii-Princeton game
looming the fblowing daw
Stanford is looking for an easy
victoiy over I larvard (7-2.'i) and a
closer game against either Prince
ton or 1 lawaii, which Stanford has
Ix-aten twice thus far this season.
Should Stanford win its first two
games, the Cardinal is likelv to face
No. 4 USC in the semifinal game
on Saturday. The matc hup is ex
pected to be extremely intense and
physical. Stanford and I SCare 1-
1 against each other thus far this
season. Both games were decided
by one goal.
USC is also the team Stanford

lost to after five overtime periods in
last year's c hampionship game.
Depending on the outcome of
the semifinal game, the Cardinal
will most likely face No. l 2 Califor
nia or No. 3 I (ILA. C California has
suffered two losses against I CIA
thus far this season, and the Bruins
are favored to beat the Bears de
spite their lower tanking.
Prior to last year, California has
made it to even championship
game during nationals since the

birth of the sport five years ago.
In the history of the sport, no
four teams have been as evenly
matched as this year's four top
ranked teams.
"California, USC, UCLA and us
are clearly the top four teams in the
nation," said head coach John
fanner. "We all have a compara
ble record between us."
This four teams have all played
each other several times over the
course of the season. The outcome

of all of their matchups has varied.
"There are no clear patterns
and no clear predictions can be
made about who will end with the
national title," Tanner said. "We've
all played each other, we've all
beaten each other, and we've all
lost. This weekend anything can
happen."
Despite the unpredictabilty of
the tournament, the team feels

confident in its ability and prepara
tion.
"()ur performance at the nation
al championship tournament has
been our main fix us since we began
conditioning in September," said
Frank. "We approached each game
as a way to improve our skills and set
ourselves up for this weekend's

tournament."
Thus fin Stanford has acheived
everything it set out to.
"We planned to use the season as
a learning and growing experi
ence," Tanner said. "We planned to
consistently play hard and to play
our best games by the end of the sea
son. We also wanted to give our
selves the best seating possible."
Stanford's season record shows
just that. It finished fourth at its first
tournament, followed by a third
place and then a second-place fin
ishing at the next respective tourna

ments.
It then l>eat California in the
championship game of the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation
Championship, giving Stanford the
conference title and moving it up to
the top spot in the nation.
The last step before nationals was
the national qualifying tournament
to decide this weekend's seeding.
Stanford again topped California in
the championship game and held
on to its No. 1 rank and the top seed.
This weekend is the final step in
what appears to be a well thought

out plan.
"We're tapered, we're rested,
and we are as mentally prepared as
we'll ever be," said junior co-captain
Hilary Gallogly. "All we have to do
now is follow through with what
we've started."
The key to winning, according to
Tanner, will be mental toughness.
"We need to play consistently
and hold on to our composure
throughout the weekend," Tanner
said. "Our best chance for success is
to follow our game plan and play
the way we do in practice."
