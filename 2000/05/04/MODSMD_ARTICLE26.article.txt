pool in Indianapolis, Incl., this
weekend and attempt to bring

No. 1 Stanford (25-4) enters
play Friday as the tournament's
top seed. After three straight trips
to the national semifinals — in
cluding a loss in the title game last
year — the Cardinal believes this is
its year to break through.
"It all comes down to this week
end," freshman goalie Jackie
Frank said. " This is what we've
been training for and this is where
we all make it happen."
Stanford must win four in a row
to claim the championship. In its
first game, the Cardinal will face
No. 18 Harvard, with the winner
of the Hawaii-Princeton game

Stanford is looking for an easy
victoiy over I larvard (7-2.'i) and a
closer game against either Prince

Should Stanford win its first two
games, the Cardinal is likelv to face
No. 4 USC in the semifinal game
on Saturday. The matc hup is ex

ranked teams.
"California, USC, UCLA and us
are clearly the top four teams in the

This four teams have all played
each other several times over the
course of the season. The outcome

of all of their matchups has varied.
"There are no clear patterns
and no clear predictions can be
made about who will end with the
national title," Tanner said. "We've
all played each other, we've all
beaten each other, and we've all
