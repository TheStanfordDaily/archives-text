# After draft, Walters readies for NFL

'lit seems so complicated: Go to the combine,
|)i£k an agent, sweat two days and five rounds and
picks before the phone rings, fight the butter
flies and a still-healing wrist and try to survive your
tifit days in an NFL helmet.
>tAll the while, the pundits are ringing in your
Oafs. Too short, the mantra goes. A reach in fifth
round, the experts warn. A practice player, say
personnel gurus.
Sounds like a nightmare.
'Unless you're Troy Walters. In your mind, this
\vi)ole draft thing isn't so complicated after all.
jJ»"The main thing is just the mental aspect —
people sometimes make too big of a deal of
gting to the NFL," Walters said. "A lot of the
Payers in the NFL, I played against in college.
C*sys are faster, bigger, but it comes down to
leaking plays and just playing football. Once
get over the mental side of it, you realize it's
football."
;<JSince his college career ended in a cast at the
Rkse Bowl Jan. 1, Stanford's most productive
usde receiver ever has spent three and a half
ninths preparing himself, both physically and
iftfcntally, for the jump from college to the pros.
SjHis journey from Ail-American wide receiver
ofthe Pacific 10 Conference champions to lowly
rookie at the bottom of the depth chart ended last
Friday with his first step onto the Minnesota
Rings' practice field for minicamp.
J Finally, time to play ball.
kJ»After Stanford's season ended with a loss to
Wisconsin in Pasadena, doctors operated on Wal
ters' dislocated right wrist. Nearly five months
he's ahead of the rehab schedule with no
pain — the only thing lacking is mobility, for the
rtjtoment.
\Ah, but before stepping onto the field, and
even before contracts and training camps and ex
hibitions, the NFL scouting combine was there,
u£ady to make or break the future careers of hun
(Hfcds of NFL hopefuls.
;i*The combine draws all 31 NFL teams and their
personnel directors to Indianapolis, Ind., in Feb
ruary to put potential prospects through their
p*& es, including tests such as bench press, vertical
l«Jp, physical exams, interviews with teams and
tlj£ Holy Grail ofstat geeks, the 40-yard dash.
'J»So s<x>n after the season ended came workouts
\#h the track team, to increase agility and speed,
Iteause, as Walters notes, "everything is geared
tpfvards the combine, and running a good 40-

yard dash."
And the combine itself?
"It's a meat market," said Walters, laughing,
strength testing, x-rays. .. .The next day
you go to the stadium, and you go for all these
physicals for teams, just pulling on you and asking
all these questions, like you're a piece of meat, and
they want to know everything that's wrong with
you."
Finally, on April 15-16, the big weekend ar
rived. Prior to the draft, Walters did what any self
respecting draft dweeb would do — hit the 'net
looking for info.
"I had no idea" where I would get drafted, he
said. "1 l<K)ked on the Internet for mcxk drafts,
and 1 saw anywhere from fourth to seventh
[rounds], you hear all these different experts say
ing different things, but you really don't know Ik*-
cause all it comes down to is one team liking you.
I wanted to go within the first four rounds, but I
didn't get my expectations up because it's such a
crapshoot."
With his father, Vikings linebackers' coach
Trent Walters, in the team'stlraft day "war room,"

Troy sal at home with his mother, waiting for the
phone to ring.
I he call finally did come for Walters on the
draft s second day, but not quite front the person
he was expecting.
"1 figured it was my dad calling to tell me who
they were going to pick," Walters said, "but it was
[Vikings head coach Dennis] (ireen on the phone,
and he said I low'd you like to play for us?'. It was
exciting ... it was a relief for it to be over, not have
to worry about where you were going."
Because Trent has been a Minnesota assistant
since 1994, Stanford's star will be heading back
home, and to an organization he is more than fa
miliar with.
"It's hard to believe, because I was a ball boy for
the Vikings my senior year in high school. So I was
catching passes from Warren Moon, Brad John
son ... picking up jocks," Walters said. "During
the summer, mv main job was security ... work
ing in the weight room, making sure no one got
too close to the gin s. Now, afier all that, to be one

Stanford flanker Troy Walters, honored with the 1999 Biletnikoff Award as the nation's top college re
ceiver, will soon be wearing the purple and gold of the NFL's Minnesota Vikings.
<>112 the guys, it's just crazy."
Crazy it may Ik-, but Walters will
now Ik- lining upon the field next to
established NFL stars such as Randy
Moss .nut C Iris (lat ter, whom he saw
firsthand at the minicamp last week
end.

"It was exciting to go out on the
same field as Randy Moss, Cris
Carter, Robert Smith, just to Ix* in
the pros," he said. "But all that ex
citement kind of went away, because
it's business."
Being a low-round draft pick,
Walters will certainly have to earn
his way into the lineup, especially
given the talent the Vikings have at
receiver already. If you ask him,
though, he definitely believes there's

a place for him on the field.
"1 think I provide quickness that
they don't have, and 1 think they can
utilize me in different areas — re
verses, isolation on a linebacker,
112 lopefiilly in the return game, 1 can
help out on kickoff and punt returns
as well," he said.
The pundits don't give him
much of a chance to play. But then
again, the pundits won't be out on
the field when training camp opens

in August.
For now, there are classes to fin
ish, a master's degree to earn, an
other Vikings minicamp in a month.
The draft journey is over; another
has begun.
"I haven't made the team yet,
and 1 have to go out there and prove
I belong in this league." Walters
said." It's a new chapter. I'm used to
the cardinal and white, but now I'm
about purple and gold."
