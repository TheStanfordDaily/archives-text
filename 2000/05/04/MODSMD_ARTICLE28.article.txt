# 'May Day' cries greet Nike tactics
## 
### 
Like a hundred other
NCAA Division I foot
ball teams across the
country, the Oregon
Ducks celebrated the end of
spring workouts Saturday by
scrimmaging on their home turf
in Kugene's Autzen Stadium.

Like thou
sands of
other protest
ers world
wide, 20 Ore
gon labor ac
tivists cele
brated May
Day by get
ting I hem-

selves arrested in downtown
Portland Monday.
I wo hours of interstate free
way separate Kugene and Port
land. One man unites lineback
ers and rioters. A man who
could be coming to a university
near you with millions of dollars
in hand.
And we might not want it.
Phil Knight — CEO of Nike,
Stanford business graduate, al
leged oppressor of sweatshop
workers in South Asia — incited
the wrath of an unlikely pair of
groups last week when he axed a
$20 million donation to help re
build Autzen and give the Ducks
a first-class pigskin facility.
Knight pulled out of the
handshake deal — and pledged
to freeze any further contribu
tions to his undergraduate alma
mater — after learning that
()regon's students and adminis
tration had joined the Workers
Rights Consortium, a student
supported group seeking to end
labor abuses in factories that
produce clothing with universi

ty logos.
University officials ref used to
break with the consortium, or to
join a Knight-supported rival
factory watchdog group that in
vites industry participation. So
like a kid who doesn't like to play
when he can't win, Knight took
his $20 million ball and went
home.
Home, for Nike, is in Beaver
ton, a suburb less than 10 miles
from downtown Portland,
where 300 people marched in a
worker's rights protest parade
Monday.
The protesters, 20 of whom
ended the afternoon in hand
cuffs for disobeying police or
ders to disperse, weren't target
ing Nike per se. But there's no
refuting that, in the eyes of
labor-rights advocates, Knight's
company fits the image of op
pressive corporate America like
a pair of custom-made Air Jor
dans.
Activists have decried Nike
labor practices for years. Now,
they have a new and unlikely
anti-Knight ally in Oregon:
Duck football fans, who looked
at the Autzen renovation plans
as a chance to push the school
into the ranks of college foot
ball's elite.
Knight's decision to pull the
plug on his gift — and effective
ly, the entire renovation plan —
will certainly hurt Oregon on
the gridiron (though you can
bet alums of rival Oregon State
have never been more support
ive of labor causes in developing
countries).
But the money is Knight's to


Jim Tankersley
spend and, spoiled as he may
look, you can't blame him for
doing what he wants with it. lie
didn't have to donate in the first
place.
What you can do is commend
the university for sticking to its
principles — whether you agree
with them or not — in the lace of a
huge financial hit. And you can
urge Stanford officials to take a
similar high road if Knight starts
shopping his strings-attached
funds on the Farm.
Knight owns two degrees — a
bachelor's from Oregon and an
MBA from Stanford. He has gen
erously donated to both schools in
the past. Nike supplies the uni
forms for nearly all Stanford
sports teams.
And now Knight has $20 mil
lion back on his hands.

1 here's no indication, from
anyone at Nike or Stanford, that
Knight is even considering otter
ing all or part of that money to
Stanford. But if he's itching to
spruce up a college football stadi
um, lie's only got one alma mater
left.
Stanford doesn't belong to the
Worker's Rights Consortium,
though 100 people signed a work
er's-rights petition at a May Day
protest in White Plaza Monday.
I'm not here to say it should join
the consortium, or any other labor
watchdog group.
But "the- University-should re
serve the right to kec'p hs options
open. In a strange but proud al
liance. labor activists anM football
fans should band together and en
courage the Athletics Department
to keep principles ahead of sports
funds.
I have a feeling they'll listen.
