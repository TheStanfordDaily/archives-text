# 'May Day' cries greet Nike tactics
## 
### 
Like a hundred other
NCAA Division I foot
ball teams across the
country, the Oregon
Ducks celebrated the end of
spring workouts Saturday by
scrimmaging on their home turf
in Kugene's Autzen Stadium.

Like thou
sands of
other protest
ers world
wide, 20 Ore
gon labor ac
tivists cele
brated May
Day by get
ting I hem-

selves arrested in downtown
Portland Monday.
I wo hours of interstate free
way separate Kugene and Port
land. One man unites lineback
ers and rioters. A man who
could be coming to a university
near you with millions of dollars
in hand.
And we might not want it.
Phil Knight — CEO of Nike,
Stanford business graduate, al
leged oppressor of sweatshop
workers in South Asia — incited
the wrath of an unlikely pair of
groups last week when he axed a
$20 million donation to help re
build Autzen and give the Ducks
a first-class pigskin facility.
Knight pulled out of the
handshake deal — and pledged
to freeze any further contribu
tions to his undergraduate alma
mater — after learning that
()regon's students and adminis
tration had joined the Workers
Rights Consortium, a student
supported group seeking to end
labor abuses in factories that
produce clothing with universi

ty logos.
University officials ref used to
break with the consortium, or to
join a Knight-supported rival
factory watchdog group that in
vites industry participation. So
like a kid who doesn't like to play
when he can't win, Knight took
his $20 million ball and went
home.
Home, for Nike, is in Beaver
ton, a suburb less than 10 miles
from downtown Portland,
where 300 people marched in a
worker's rights protest parade
Monday.
The protesters, 20 of whom
ended the afternoon in hand
cuffs for disobeying police or
ders to disperse, weren't target
ing Nike per se. But there's no
refuting that, in the eyes of
labor-rights advocates, Knight's
company fits the image of op
pressive corporate America like
a pair of custom-made Air Jor
dans.
Activists have decried Nike
labor practices for years. Now,
they have a new and unlikely
anti-Knight ally in Oregon:
Duck football fans, who looked
at the Autzen renovation plans
as a chance to push the school
into the ranks of college foot
ball's elite.
Knight's decision to pull the
plug on his gift — and effective
ly, the entire renovation plan —
will certainly hurt Oregon on
the gridiron (though you can
bet alums of rival Oregon State
have never been more support
ive of labor causes in developing
countries).
But the money is Knight's to
