### EMILY DRESSEL STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Softball fans don't often get to revel in
the kind of scoring fiiry that the No. 10 Cardinal
ignited in San Jose.
While one and two-rnn conference decisions
have characterized the team's season thus far,
Stanford dominated San Jose State in a double
header Tuesday.
I he CCardinal (41-14) had the Spartans by the
jugular and squirming, sweeping both games, 5-
I and 12-1.
"We put it all together on Tuesday," said head
coach John Rittman. "Everyone in the lineup
contributed and when you do that, you can score
the numbers of runs that we did against San Jose
State."
112 reshman pitcher Maureen LeCocq (7-4)
snagged the game-one win while allowing only
two hits and one earned run before freshman
teammate l ori Nyberg took over mound duties
in the siKth.
The (lardinal offense got off to a quick start in
that game, when sophomore first baseman Sarah

Beeson drove in fellow sophomore Jessica Men
doza from second with a two-out double.
The women continued to pound away in the
fifth by stringing together five hits in the inning,
including RBI doubles by both sophomore short
stop Robin Walker and senior catcher Kellie Wig
inton.
In game two, Stanford showed no mercy, rop
ing balls left and right on the San Jose State soft
ball field like it was weekday batting practice.
In the second inning alone, the team racked
up seven runs. Wiginton broke the ice with a dou
ble before the rest of the order proceeded to drive
runners around and load up the bases time and
time again.
A series of walks handed the Cardinal a couple
of insurance runs on a silver platter. But then up
came the dreaded and feared three-time Pacific
10 Conference Player of the Week this season,
Mendoza.
Mendoza wasn't l<x>king for a fi ee pass. The
Stanford center fielder ended the inning on a
bang, clocking a grand slam over the outfield
fence, clearing the bases and posting four more
runs for the team.

Yet, the Cardinal offense was tar from sedat
ed, especially in the home run department.
Mendoza Hit her second home run of the
game, and her 11th of the year, in the fourth,
scoring Wiginton from first.
loiter that same inning, junior third baseman
Jenni Shideler mustered a three-run homer
two outs to cap off the slaughter.
"Our coach has been till king to us all lately
about working during the weekday game to pre
pare for the Pac-10," said Shideler. "In these non
conference game you can afford to work on what
it is you need to improve individually and our
team hit really well."
Overall on the day, Mendoza batted an un
heard of 6 for 7 and racked up two homers, two
doubles and six RBIs.
While freshman go-to pitcher Dana Sorensen
rested up after throwing two games this past
weekend, freshman Jaime Forman-Lau main
tained her perfect record of 8-0 while disposing
of the Spartan lineup in five innings.
The Cardinal returns to Pac-10 play this week
end, facing Oregon and Oregon State on the
road.
