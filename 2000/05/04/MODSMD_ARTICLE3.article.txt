# Cops nix Lake Lag treehouse

### AMIT GARG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford Police ordered
sophomores Daniel Van der
Ahe and Bradley Markham to
remove by yesterday the tree
house they are building near
Lagunita, though the stu
dents have yet to comply.
"I had the idea last week,"
said Van der Ahe. "It was just
to have fun, to have a place to
hang out. It was going to be lo
aned on the west side of the
lake and occupy about 10
square feet."
As Van der Ahe and
Markham began hammering
boards into the oak tree, how
ever, the police stopped their
work.
"The police have stopped
our awesome tree house, be
cause they do not want to be
asked why they did not know
about it. [They] were really stoked
on the tree house, but said they we
needed a building permit," said
Van der Age.
According to Imogen Church,
manager for undergraduate hous
ing, "People can't just start building
without an appropriate permit.
There is a whole process they have
to go [through]. First the tree house
has to conform to safety rules and
[Americans with Disabilities Act]
guidelines.
"Besides, the trees by l,ake
are of historical importance," she
added.
Building a tree house around
Lake would not only re
quire getting a building permit,
but would also require convincing
the University that the tree house
meets county and city safety stan
dards.
I lerbert Fong, head of the Uni
versity's Grounds Department, ex

plained, "To build a structure on
campus, one must work through
the Planning Office for the buildiijg
site. At that point our office jls
brought in to see the negative im
pact on the health of the tree. More
over, all plants on University
grounds are considered part of tljit*
landscape.
"One of the biggest problems
faced by [University President
Gerhard] Casper was all the land
around the Foothills that hiÂ£
could not develop," Fong said.-Jj
"That goes to show that evefc
the president faces the same frus
tration these students are fac
in S"
Fong said he believes rule-#
should be followed strictly, fter
also said the University faces a
huge amount of litigation every
day.
"Even something as innocent
a tree house requires a permit,
Fong added." If these students want
to build a tree house they can cer
tainly do it. They just need to go
through the right track and have
persistence."
