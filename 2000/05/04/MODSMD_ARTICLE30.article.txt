# Men's golf tunes up at final home meet
## 
### MATT LONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Alter a disappointing sixth-place finish at the
Pacific 10 Conference Championships in Tuc
son, Ari/.., the Stanford men's golf "team hopes to
gain playoff momentum in its last regular season
match at Stanford Coll (bourse.
The l 1 ) Ist annual U.S. Intercollegiate will he se
nior captain 1 )i isty Brett's last chanc eto shine on
the Cardinal's home course, as well as retiring
head coach Wally Coodwin's farewell endeavor
to lead the squad to victory at the Farm.
After Coodwin oversees three competitive
rounds this weekend, he will lead his team to the
NCAA West Regional on May 18, the qualifier for
the NCAA(lhampionships.
No. 18 Stanford will be challenged by Pac-10
locs Oregon, Oregon State and California, all of
whom finished above the Cardinal in the Pac-lOs,
as well as 14 other schools, many of whom are
hungry to earn Ijerths in the Regional.
Kvery player on Stanford's roster will play in
the tournament, five as a team and five individu-

ally. This should give Coodwin one last opportu
nity to decide which players will travel to the re
gional in Madera.
The Intercollegiate "will be sort of"a guide,"
said Coodwin. There are two weeks before the
regional, and golf is pretty much a now game. It
should give us a better idea of whose game is hot."
One who continues to improve is freshman
Jim Seki, who on the last day of the Pac-10
championships outscored the field with a 7-
under 65.
"He is playing like a storm," said Coodwin.
"He is not on top of his game, but he's getting
there."
Joining Seki and Brett to compete as a team
will be juniors Fric Dahlberg, the top Cardinal
finisher in Tucson, and juniors Jimmy Lee and
Alex Ai agon.
Besides looking at only scores in choosing
what team to field at the Regional, Ccxxlwin will
rely upon the number of fairways and greens hit
by each golfer. Driving straight will Ix* crucial this
weekend, as the rough lining the fairway has
grown to nearly a f<>ot, mirroring the jungle-like

conditions at River Bend Golf Course, site of the
Regional.
Goodwin calls both "driver's tournaments."
Though it has already qualified for the
NCAAs, the team will defend its home ground
with a vengeance, and looks not just to tune up
for things to come, but to emerge victorious.
"We really are aiming to win this weekend,"
said Brett. "Our goal is the Regional and the
National Championships, but for me it's my last
chance to come out here. It's a little sentimen
tal but I am focused on the postseason. A lot of
teams will be fighting hard to make the Re
gional."
Last year Stanford finished third behind
BYU and runner-up Oregon. The Cardinal
commences play with 36 holes on Saturday and
concludes with 18 on Sunday. Play starts at 8 a;.r(v.
and admission is free.
"I've had a wonderful career," Goodwin said.
"This year everything has f>een the last time and
I'm used to doing things for the last time. It's just
another tournament and its secondary because
we still look at the NCAAs as our goal."
