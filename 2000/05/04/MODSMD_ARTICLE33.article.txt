# Asia initiative sparks interest
## 
### KATHERINE LEMONS 
Stanford's newest interdisci
plinary effort, the Asian Religions
and Cultures Initiative, kicked off
its mission this year to examine is
sues of timeless pertinence to
Asia.
The initiative is co-directed by
Religious Studies Prof. Bernard
112 am e and Cregory Shopen, ( in -
tently a professor of East Asian
Studies and Literatures at UCIA
who will join Stanford's Religious
Studies department in the fall. It
focuses on bringing conferences,
lectures, visiting scholars, publica
tions, workshops, exhibits and
performances to the Stanford
campus.
Eventually, Faure and Reli
gious Studies Prof. Carl Bieleleldt
would like to be able to support
postdoctoral scholars in related
fields. Bieleleldt co-directs the
Center for Buddhist Studies and
has been active in the initiative's
founding,
I lie program offers scholars,
professors, students and the
wider community an opportunity
to discuss its expansive topic from
an interdisciplinary perspective.
Both because of its orientation to
ward the humanities and its em
phasis on South Asia, the pro
gram is unique among existing of
ferings at Stanford in both reli
gious and Asian studies.
"We are looking at a wide
range of areas that are not well
represented on campus, such as
South Asia, Chinese religions and
Islam," Faure said.
l be initiative emerged last
year as part of an ongoing attempt
to revitalize the study of Asia at
Stanford. University President
Gerhard Casper allocated
$250,000 toward the South Asia
Initiative to be used for costs and
development of the program, and
for research and conferences on
South Asia on a University-wide
basis.
Rafiq Dossani, a professor in
the Asia Pacific Research Center
and the South Asia Initiative,
asked for proposals from differ
ent departments interested in
putting the President's Fund
money to use. Bieleleldt authored
one of the three proposals which
Dossani funded.
"The fund is meant to be seed
money to try to get more money
with the proof of faculty support"
that the initiative provides, Dos
sani said.
Bieleleldt and Fame said they
recognize that the ARC program
will require additional funds, and
are eager to stabilize its finances.
Bielefeldt's goal is to establish a
permanent endowment to sup
port the initiative.
File Asia Pacific Research Cen
ter raised more than $300,000

from private donors last year
alone, a portion of which was ear
marked for initiative's use. This
fundraising success, Dossani
noted, "shows that there is inter
est" in ihe study of South Asia.
The new initiative represents a
shift in emphasis at Stanford to
ward South Asia, which many led
has been notably under-repre
sented. The initiative's alliance
with the South Asia Initiative as
well as with community groups
like the South Asian Center lor
Humanities Institute puts it in a
strong position to provide a rich
examination of the area, Biele
leldt said.
I he University realized "that if
we have any integrity, it needed to
cover this part of the world,"
Bieleleldt said.
Dossani concurred, saying,
"Two years ago, we would not
have been in a position to dream
of such funding."
"Stanlbrd's program in South
Asian religious studies is not as de
veloped as programs at UC-
Berkeley and UC-Santa Cruz, so
[we] have been unable to target
funding," Dossani said.
But according to Dossani, in
the past several years more stu
dents of Indian origin have come
to Stanford, and their interest in
studying India has sparked a
change in curriculum and pro
gramming. Dossani also noted
that the recent civic and econom
ic boom in Silicon Valley has had
a profound impact on the avail
ability of funding for the study of
South Asia.
Indeed, current programs
lot us almost exclusively on India
and Pakistan.
This fall, visiting Religious
Studies IVof. Linda Hess orga
nized and hosted a symposium ti
tled "Early Indian Religions: In
teractions," co-sponsored by the
Department of Religious Studies
and the initiative.
The symposium featured eight
scholars of Buddhism, I linduism
and Jainistn who reflected on the
ways in which these religions de
fined themselves, shared com
mon ground and interacted
across often fluid boundaries dur
ing the early periods of their de
velopment.
Upcoming events co-spon
sored by the initiative include a
the program "Partitions and Mi
grations: Novel and Movie of
India in 1947." Bapsi Sidhwa, the
author of "Cracking India," will
read from her book and screen
Deepa Mehta's film adaptation
"Earth."
This event is part of the series
"From Partition to Ayodhya De
molition" organized by Hess.
I here will be a morning lecture
series in conjunction with the pro
gram.
