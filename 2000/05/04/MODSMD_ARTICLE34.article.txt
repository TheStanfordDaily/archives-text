An interview with porno mega-star
Stacy Valentine and Adam Berns,
producer of "The Girl Next Poor"

A porn star saunters into an empty
classroom in the School of Educa
tion for a private interview. Dressed
in tight black from bust to toe, this
blonde beauty carries a bottle of
water and admits that she is ner
vous. Your savvy Intermission edi
tor calms her down, making her feel
at ease, and for the next hour, an
intensely personal conversation
unfolds about pornography, relation
ships, documentary filmmaking and
sex.

Meanwhile, a screening for Stanford
students plays in Cubberly Auditorium of
a documentary about this incredible starlet's life.
Intermission's one-hour interview remains intermission
less, so to speak, until three members of an anonymous frater
nity burst into the classroom, unexpectedly asking the celebrity
to autograph their bottoms.

Earlier in the evening, an interview was conducted with
the producer of the screened documentary. No body
parts were signed.

Adam Berns is a 1984 Stanford graduate in economics with a joint
law and MBA degree from UCLA. Currently, he is the executive

as a film producer.
Which brings us to Stacy
Valentine. Valentine, nee
Stacy Baker, is one of the
biggest porn stars in the
adult entertainment busi
ness. A contract actress
for VCA pictures, Stacy
has graced the box cov
ers of more than 40
videos, and has

appeared in over 65 adult features including "Cafe Flesh 2,'
"Red Vibe Diaries," "Devil and Mrs. Jones ti." "New Wave
Hookers 5," and "Mv Horny Valentine."

â–  A Menage to Remember
Up until about four years ago, the two had about as much
in common as, well, an internet start-up exec and a porn
star.

Enter documentary filmmaker and Berns' good friend
Christine Fugate, known primarily in the PBS world for
her films "Mother Love" and "Tobacco Blues." Fugate

had a vision for a documentary of two vears in the life of
a porn film star.
Berns loved the idea, helped to fund the project, and

in her search for a subject, found Valentine.
"My manager Jack [Gallagher] told me there was a
woman who wanted to do a documentary and follow
a porn star around. And I said, 'okay,' I'll do that.
Because 1 was used to being followed around by cam
era crews on porn sets all day," said Valentine.
When Valentine agreed to allow Fugate into every
aspect of her life for two years, l'ugate invited the starlet
to a screening of her film "Mother Love."

"It was a documentary about four sets of mothers and
daughters, and I'm a momim's girl, so I was just so moved

and touched by all the emotions that Christine brought
out," said Valentine. "When the documentary was over, I
cried and called my mom and said I love you.' And I turned
to Christine and said, 'let's do this.' "

The final product of this menage-a-trois is " The Gil l Next
Door," a revealing and sometimes disturbing insider's look at

the porn business, tinged with humor, and thoroughly imbued
with humanity. Fugate stays relatively distant from her subject.

and this absence of moralizing in the film is what makes it one ol the
