## A 						WEEKLY LOOK AT ARTS, ENTERTAINMENT AND STYLE AT STANFORD From housewife to porn star 
### ZACH UDKO EDITORIAL STAFF 
An interview with porno mega-star
Stacy Valentine and Adam Berns,
producer of "The Girl Next Poor"

A porn star saunters into an empty
classroom in the School of Educa
tion for a private interview. Dressed
in tight black from bust to toe, this
blonde beauty carries a bottle of
water and admits that she is ner
vous. Your savvy Intermission edi
tor calms her down, making her feel
at ease, and for the next hour, an
intensely personal conversation
unfolds about pornography, relation
ships, documentary filmmaking and
sex.

Meanwhile, a screening for Stanford
students plays in Cubberly Auditorium of
a documentary about this incredible starlet's life.
Intermission's one-hour interview remains intermission
less, so to speak, until three members of an anonymous frater
nity burst into the classroom, unexpectedly asking the celebrity
to autograph their bottoms.

Earlier in the evening, an interview was conducted with
the producer of the screened documentary. No body
parts were signed.

Adam Berns is a 1984 Stanford graduate in economics with a joint
law and MBA degree from UCLA. Currently, he is the executive
vice president of hiwire.com, an Internet startup geared at stream
ing advertisements across the web. In his downtime, Berns moonlights

"The Girl Next
Door". Not Rated.
Opens May 12 at y
the Lumiere in San
Francisco and the
Town 3 in San Jose

as a film producer.
Which brings us to Stacy
Valentine. Valentine, nee
Stacy Baker, is one of the
biggest porn stars in the
adult entertainment busi
ness. A contract actress
for VCA pictures, Stacy
has graced the box cov
ers of more than 40
videos, and has

appeared in over 65 adult features including "Cafe Flesh 2,'
"Red Vibe Diaries," "Devil and Mrs. Jones ti." "New Wave
Hookers 5," and "Mv Horny Valentine."

■ A Menage to Remember
Up until about four years ago, the two had about as much
in common as, well, an internet start-up exec and a porn
star.

Enter documentary filmmaker and Berns' good friend
Christine Fugate, known primarily in the PBS world for
her films "Mother Love" and "Tobacco Blues." Fugate

had a vision for a documentary of two vears in the life of
a porn film star.
Berns loved the idea, helped to fund the project, and

in her search for a subject, found Valentine.
"My manager Jack [Gallagher] told me there was a
woman who wanted to do a documentary and follow
a porn star around. And I said, 'okay,' I'll do that.
Because 1 was used to being followed around by cam
era crews on porn sets all day," said Valentine.
When Valentine agreed to allow Fugate into every
aspect of her life for two years, l'ugate invited the starlet
to a screening of her film "Mother Love."

"It was a documentary about four sets of mothers and
daughters, and I'm a momim's girl, so I was just so moved

and touched by all the emotions that Christine brought
out," said Valentine. "When the documentary was over, I
cried and called my mom and said I love you.' And I turned
to Christine and said, 'let's do this.' "

The final product of this menage-a-trois is " The Gil l Next
Door," a revealing and sometimes disturbing insider's look at

the porn business, tinged with humor, and thoroughly imbued
with humanity. Fugate stays relatively distant from her subject.

and this absence of moralizing in the film is what makes it one ol the


NATACHA POGGIO/The Stanford Daily
better documentaries in recent years.
Clu istine (lidn I want to be judgmen
tal. We ve had anti-porn people tell us
what a great anti-porn message the film
has, and al the same time, we've had
Hugh Hefner watch it and love it as well.
So I really think that people get out of it
what they want," said Herns. "It's really a
story about a woman trying to find her
way in the world, and it just so happens
to take place in the world of porn."
■ Busting into the Business
1 lie film covers a span of two years iu
Valentines life, from her early days m
the business, to her rise in fame and
recognition at the Hot IVOr Awards in
Cannes, where she was awarded the
prize for Best American Starlet. Inciden
tally, Valentine will be returning to
Cannes this year to accept the award
again.
"Over the two years, Christine went
everywhere with me. More than Julian,
actually, and I liked her better than
Julian," admitted Valentine.
Julian was Valentine s boyfriend at the
time, and fugate seems to take a partic
ular interest in him as a subject in the
film. I hat relationship falls apart in front
ol the camera's lens, as Valentine puts
her career aspirations iu front of every
thing else in her life*. Valentine admit
tedly also had major trust issues, and a
tattoo on her neck that reaffirms that.
"1 still don i trust anyone, she insisted.
"My tattoo sa\s onk trust in yourself,'
and I'll always wear that."
Valentine's abusive relationship with
her ex-husband in Oklahoma paved the
way for her entrance into the business.
Once Valentine submitted to his desires
to get breast implants and pose for an
amateur centerfold magazine contest, he
had forever lost his housewife to the
industry. Valentine almost immediately
moved out to Hollywood to became a
star. Stacy Baker become Stacy Valentine
al that point.
" There was good for Stacy in the busi
ness," said Berns. "In some way, it was
her leverage to get out of a horrible mar
riage. But you do see in the film JthatJ it
has an effect on her."
■ Close-ups from afar
Fugate is careful to keep her subject at
a reasonable distance, as filmmakers in
this form are encouraged to do. Accord
ing Lo Berns, this was especially difficult
for Fugate because of the way the film

was shot. Fugate followed Valentine vir
tually on her own for two years, with no
camera crews and only a digital video
camera which she handled herself. Nat
urally, the two formed quite a bond in
the process.
"Christine and Stacy developed a trust
relationship that was built over time.
That's why Christine wanted to shoot for
so long," said Berns. "But it became awk
ward for Christine at times because Stacy
began to view her as one of her best
friends."
Altogether, Fugate captured 130 hours
of Valentine's life on her camera over
the two years.
"It was difficult for her, because she
kept having to distance herself from me.
She could never give me advice or tell
me what to do, never really contribute,"
said Valentine. "When 1 would ask her
questions, she wouldn't tell me anything.
Now I realize why she did that, why she
didn't interfere."
Since Valentine got used to telling her
everything about her life, the two still
keep in touch on a daily basis, and now
Fugate offers advice to her friend.
Valentine has only seen the 82 min
utes of film that audiences across Ameri
ca will see, and she has little interest in
seeing the other 128 hours.
"I've only seen what made it into the
film, the final cut. I trusted Christine to
pick what she wanted to put in," said
Valentine. "It's such a weird experience
to watch it. Every time 1 see it, 1 end up
back in that spot. It's like watching a
memory that I'm thinking of."
Seeing " The Cirl Next Door" has not
only c hanged Valentine's outlook on life,
but it has also completely changed her
self-image. "Watching it is very thera
peutic," explained Valentine. "I learned
communication skills. Before, if I had a
problem, 1 would push it to the back of
my mind and not talk about it. Now peo
ple ask me why 1 did particular things in
the film, and I actually have to ask myself
why I did it. It taught me a lot about
myself. I'm much more comfortable
about the way 1 look. I don't think that
I'm ugly anymore, because I know that
I'm not ugly. I've learned that I am pret
ty. Fveryone should look at themselves
th,it way, because everyone has qualities
that makes them beautiful."
Valentine has yet to show her film to
her mother, even though her mother
talks quite openly in segments about how
proucl she is of her daughter.
"1 didn't show this to my mom because
I don't want her to see me naked, and it
would really hurt her to see the things
that 1 go though, like the plastic
surgery," said Valentine. "You have to
experience the bad times to experience

■ The Real Pornography?
One of the most shocking elements in
the film is the graphic depiction of sever
al of Valentine's plastic surgerv proce
dnres, from breast reduction to liposuc
tion to lip implants. While there is nudi
ty in the film, and plenty of it, fwgate
manages to handle ii all quite tastefully.
Ironically, these questionable gratuitous
operation scenes push moments of the
film towards borderline pornography.
"We decided to include them because 1
think it was real important to get a sense
of what this woman was willing to go
through for her body image," said
Herns. "She lias a better bod\ than 9 ( .)'/<
of the planet, and she still is getting ;ill
this surgery, for the audience to under
stand this and the compromises Stac\
takes in this business, you have to go
through what Stacy went through."
Valentine still can't watch these scenes.
She says she has a very physical reaction
to them, that instanth pulls her head
down as soon as the sequences begin.
But she insists that these are nonetheless
essential scenes to telling the story of her
lile.
"11l can affect one person to see what
this surgery is really like, then I'm
happy. Kven if 1 change the perspective
of a guv who wants his girlfriend to get
big boobs," said Valentine. "This side is
not shown ever. They don't show vou
"videos in the doctor's office. 1 hat was a
time in mv life when I was completeh
out of control."

Since Valentine first saw the film last
year, she has not returned to the plastic
surgeon, nor does she intend to -
though she still thinks her 1)1)+ breasts
(reduced in the film from K+ implants)
are too big.
■ The other porn star
"The (iirl Next Door" shares the inde
pendent film circuit this month with a
remarkably similar documentary about
the business, "Sex: I he .Annabel ('hong
Story. The Ciirl Next Door" is without
question the better film. "Sex" focuses
011 USC; graduate (itace Quek, a.k.a.
Annabel (Ihong, a pseudo-feminist who
gets involved in pornographv and ends
up strewing 251 men in an event billed
as "the world's largest gang-bang."
(Ihong is neither a likeable character nor
a particularly interesting subject. She's
just a depressed mess, and a real eflort
to watch.
"They are very different movies.
Annabel Chong is very nutty. She is a
profit participant iu that movie. And
she's not ver\ rclatahle bv the average
person," said Berns. "'The (iirl Next
Door' was directed In a woman, and
Stacy Valentine is relatable in main
ways. A lot of stuff that happens to her is
ver\ similar to the issues that many
women face, women that have nothing
to do with the porn business."
"Sex" director (iough Lewis also seems
to have his own agenda in the film,
exposing the pathetic and lowly of the
industry without an\ sympathy or
humanity. Fugate lets her audience
decide lor themselves.
"1 think the business is neither as bad
as people think nor as gidd\ as women
on Jem Springer make it out to be,"
offered Berns. "Almost everyone in the
business has a lot of baggage, and it lakes
a large personal toll on your life. It
desexuali/es sex. Christine wanted to
give a realistic view of the business and
let people make up theii own minds.''
Valentine had her own message to get
across: " I he industry is not what people
think. I did this documentary because I
wanted people to know that there is a
person behind the porn fantasy or
image. I'm just like you, but I have a
realls dillerent job. I'm a porn star."
Berns sees Valentine as an Kvervwom
an in the documentary, a person which
most women in America can associate
with. "1 think the narrative structure is
based on a woman's search for love.
What Stacv ultimately starts to find is
that she is searching for self-love. And
vou can't find that from other people."
■ From Porn to Pants
As of l'ebruan 2000, Valentine lias

quit the business, wrapping up produc
tion of"Red Vibe Diaries" on Valentine's
Day. She swears to never make another
film. But will she return?
"Absolutely not," s.iid Valentine. "I am
a very final person. I go by my word. I
wanted to go out with a bang. So I did
Red Vibe Diaries,' and it's really high
quality, shot on film with a big budget."
No, Valentine has no interest in main
stream films, though she does admit thai
several directors and producers have
encouraged her to puisne a career.
Instead, Valentine has taken the
entrepreneur road, starting her own
clothing company with two separate
product lines: "Good Girl" and "Bad
Ciirl."
'"(iood (.ill' is geared for college
women. 1 like to be comfortable and
have matching clothes. So 1 wanted to
start a clothing company of my own, the
way I like to dress. lank tops, shorts,
I'| s. And we spent a lot of time looking
for the fabric, because we wanted it to
feel like bulla," said Valentine. "The Bad
Girl line is sexy stuff, inainlx for club
bing."
When asked il she'll miss the business,
Valentine looks with great hope foi the
future.
"I've been doing it for four vears. It's
no longer a new, fun thing anymore,
and I've grown. I'm a different person
now," said Valentine. "I make no excus
es, no apologies For what I've done. I
don't regret anvthing. F.ven tn\ ex-hus
band. If I had it to do all over again, I
wouldn't change a thing. Otherwise I
wouldn't be talking to von. And 1
wouldn't change that for anvthing. For
god's sake, I'm speaking at Stanford
I niversitv! How incredible is that? It's
ama/ing. I can't believe I'm here!"
II The People vs. Adam Berns
As for Adam, he has a I V pilot for
Fox in the works, along with a science
fiction feature based on the best-selling
novel "Area f> 1." Adam said that though
his Internet coinpanx is very successful,
he'd still like to keep his hands in the
movie business.

the good times."
An interview with porno mega-star
Stacy Valentine and Adam Berns,
producer of "The Girl Next Poor"

A porn star saunters into an empty
classroom in the School of Educa
tion for a private interview. Dressed
in tight black from bust to toe, this
blonde beauty carries a bottle of
water and admits that she is ner
vous. Your savvy Intermission edi
tor calms her down, making her feel
at ease, and for the next hour, an
intensely personal conversation
unfolds about pornography, relation
ships, documentary filmmaking and
sex.

Meanwhile, a screening for Stanford
students plays in Cubberly Auditorium of
a documentary about this incredible starlet's life.
Intermission's one-hour interview remains intermission
less, so to speak, until three members of an anonymous frater
nity burst into the classroom, unexpectedly asking the celebrity
to autograph their bottoms.

Earlier in the evening, an interview was conducted with
the producer of the screened documentary. No body
parts were signed.

Adam Berns is a 1984 Stanford graduate in economics with a joint
law and MBA degree from UCLA. Currently, he is the executive
vice president of hiwire.com, an Internet startup geared at stream
ing advertisements across the web. In his downtime, Berns moonlights

"The Girl Next
Door". Not Rated.
Opens May 12 at y
the Lumiere in San
Francisco and the
Town 3 in San Jose

as a film producer.
Which brings us to Stacy
Valentine. Valentine, nee
Stacy Baker, is one of the
biggest porn stars in the
adult entertainment busi
ness. A contract actress
for VCA pictures, Stacy
has graced the box cov
ers of more than 40
videos, and has

appeared in over 65 adult features including "Cafe Flesh 2,'
"Red Vibe Diaries," "Devil and Mrs. Jones ti." "New Wave
Hookers 5," and "Mv Horny Valentine."

■ A Menage to Remember
Up until about four years ago, the two had about as much
in common as, well, an internet start-up exec and a porn
star.

Enter documentary filmmaker and Berns' good friend
Christine Fugate, known primarily in the PBS world for
her films "Mother Love" and "Tobacco Blues." Fugate

had a vision for a documentary of two vears in the life of
a porn film star.
Berns loved the idea, helped to fund the project, and

in her search for a subject, found Valentine.
"My manager Jack [Gallagher] told me there was a
woman who wanted to do a documentary and follow
a porn star around. And I said, 'okay,' I'll do that.
Because 1 was used to being followed around by cam
era crews on porn sets all day," said Valentine.
When Valentine agreed to allow Fugate into every
aspect of her life for two years, l'ugate invited the starlet
to a screening of her film "Mother Love."

"It was a documentary about four sets of mothers and
daughters, and I'm a momim's girl, so I was just so moved

and touched by all the emotions that Christine brought
out," said Valentine. "When the documentary was over, I
cried and called my mom and said I love you.' And I turned
to Christine and said, 'let's do this.' "

The final product of this menage-a-trois is " The Gil l Next
Door," a revealing and sometimes disturbing insider's look at

the porn business, tinged with humor, and thoroughly imbued
with humanity. Fugate stays relatively distant from her subject.

and this absence of moralizing in the film is what makes it one ol the


NATACHA POGGIO/The Stanford Daily
better documentaries in recent years.
Clu istine (lidn I want to be judgmen
tal. We ve had anti-porn people tell us
what a great anti-porn message the film
has, and al the same time, we've had
Hugh Hefner watch it and love it as well.
So I really think that people get out of it
what they want," said Herns. "It's really a
story about a woman trying to find her
way in the world, and it just so happens
to take place in the world of porn."
■ Busting into the Business
1 lie film covers a span of two years iu
Valentines life, from her early days m
the business, to her rise in fame and
recognition at the Hot IVOr Awards in
Cannes, where she was awarded the
prize for Best American Starlet. Inciden
tally, Valentine will be returning to
Cannes this year to accept the award
again.
"Over the two years, Christine went
everywhere with me. More than Julian,
actually, and I liked her better than
Julian," admitted Valentine.
Julian was Valentine s boyfriend at the
time, and fugate seems to take a partic
ular interest in him as a subject in the
film. I hat relationship falls apart in front
ol the camera's lens, as Valentine puts
her career aspirations iu front of every
thing else in her life*. Valentine admit
tedly also had major trust issues, and a
tattoo on her neck that reaffirms that.
"1 still don i trust anyone, she insisted.
"My tattoo sa\s onk trust in yourself,'
and I'll always wear that."
Valentine's abusive relationship with
her ex-husband in Oklahoma paved the
way for her entrance into the business.
Once Valentine submitted to his desires
to get breast implants and pose for an
amateur centerfold magazine contest, he
had forever lost his housewife to the
industry. Valentine almost immediately
moved out to Hollywood to became a
star. Stacy Baker become Stacy Valentine
al that point.
" There was good for Stacy in the busi
ness," said Berns. "In some way, it was
her leverage to get out of a horrible mar
riage. But you do see in the film JthatJ it
has an effect on her."
■ Close-ups from afar
Fugate is careful to keep her subject at
a reasonable distance, as filmmakers in
this form are encouraged to do. Accord
ing Lo Berns, this was especially difficult
for Fugate because of the way the film

was shot. Fugate followed Valentine vir
tually on her own for two years, with no
camera crews and only a digital video
camera which she handled herself. Nat
urally, the two formed quite a bond in
the process.
"Christine and Stacy developed a trust
relationship that was built over time.
That's why Christine wanted to shoot for
so long," said Berns. "But it became awk
ward for Christine at times because Stacy
began to view her as one of her best
friends."
Altogether, Fugate captured 130 hours
of Valentine's life on her camera over
the two years.
"It was difficult for her, because she
kept having to distance herself from me.
She could never give me advice or tell
me what to do, never really contribute,"
said Valentine. "When 1 would ask her
questions, she wouldn't tell me anything.
Now I realize why she did that, why she
didn't interfere."
Since Valentine got used to telling her
everything about her life, the two still
keep in touch on a daily basis, and now
Fugate offers advice to her friend.
Valentine has only seen the 82 min
utes of film that audiences across Ameri
ca will see, and she has little interest in
seeing the other 128 hours.
"I've only seen what made it into the
film, the final cut. I trusted Christine to
pick what she wanted to put in," said
Valentine. "It's such a weird experience
to watch it. Every time 1 see it, 1 end up
back in that spot. It's like watching a
memory that I'm thinking of."
Seeing " The Cirl Next Door" has not
only c hanged Valentine's outlook on life,
but it has also completely changed her
self-image. "Watching it is very thera
peutic," explained Valentine. "I learned
communication skills. Before, if I had a
problem, 1 would push it to the back of
my mind and not talk about it. Now peo
ple ask me why 1 did particular things in
the film, and I actually have to ask myself
why I did it. It taught me a lot about
myself. I'm much more comfortable
about the way 1 look. I don't think that
I'm ugly anymore, because I know that
I'm not ugly. I've learned that I am pret
ty. Fveryone should look at themselves
th,it way, because everyone has qualities
that makes them beautiful."
Valentine has yet to show her film to
her mother, even though her mother
talks quite openly in segments about how
proucl she is of her daughter.
"1 didn't show this to my mom because
I don't want her to see me naked, and it
would really hurt her to see the things
that 1 go though, like the plastic
surgery," said Valentine. "You have to
experience the bad times to experience

■ The Real Pornography?
One of the most shocking elements in
the film is the graphic depiction of sever
al of Valentine's plastic surgerv proce
dnres, from breast reduction to liposuc
tion to lip implants. While there is nudi
ty in the film, and plenty of it, fwgate
manages to handle ii all quite tastefully.
Ironically, these questionable gratuitous
operation scenes push moments of the
film towards borderline pornography.
"We decided to include them because 1
think it was real important to get a sense
of what this woman was willing to go
through for her body image," said
Herns. "She lias a better bod\ than 9 ( .)'/<
of the planet, and she still is getting ;ill
this surgery, for the audience to under
stand this and the compromises Stac\
takes in this business, you have to go
through what Stacy went through."
Valentine still can't watch these scenes.
She says she has a very physical reaction
to them, that instanth pulls her head
down as soon as the sequences begin.
But she insists that these are nonetheless
essential scenes to telling the story of her
lile.
"11l can affect one person to see what
this surgery is really like, then I'm
happy. Kven if 1 change the perspective
of a guv who wants his girlfriend to get
big boobs," said Valentine. "This side is
not shown ever. They don't show vou
"videos in the doctor's office. 1 hat was a
time in mv life when I was completeh
out of control."

Since Valentine first saw the film last
year, she has not returned to the plastic
surgeon, nor does she intend to -
though she still thinks her 1)1)+ breasts
(reduced in the film from K+ implants)
are too big.
■ The other porn star
"The (iirl Next Door" shares the inde
pendent film circuit this month with a
remarkably similar documentary about
the business, "Sex: I he .Annabel ('hong
Story. The Ciirl Next Door" is without
question the better film. "Sex" focuses
011 USC; graduate (itace Quek, a.k.a.
Annabel (Ihong, a pseudo-feminist who
gets involved in pornographv and ends
up strewing 251 men in an event billed
as "the world's largest gang-bang."
(Ihong is neither a likeable character nor
a particularly interesting subject. She's
just a depressed mess, and a real eflort
to watch.
"They are very different movies.
Annabel Chong is very nutty. She is a
profit participant iu that movie. And
she's not ver\ rclatahle bv the average
person," said Berns. "'The (iirl Next
Door' was directed In a woman, and
Stacy Valentine is relatable in main
ways. A lot of stuff that happens to her is
ver\ similar to the issues that many
women face, women that have nothing
to do with the porn business."
"Sex" director (iough Lewis also seems
to have his own agenda in the film,
exposing the pathetic and lowly of the
industry without an\ sympathy or
humanity. Fugate lets her audience
decide lor themselves.
"1 think the business is neither as bad
as people think nor as gidd\ as women
on Jem Springer make it out to be,"
offered Berns. "Almost everyone in the
business has a lot of baggage, and it lakes
a large personal toll on your life. It
desexuali/es sex. Christine wanted to
give a realistic view of the business and
let people make up theii own minds.''
Valentine had her own message to get
across: " I he industry is not what people
think. I did this documentary because I
wanted people to know that there is a
person behind the porn fantasy or
image. I'm just like you, but I have a
realls dillerent job. I'm a porn star."
Berns sees Valentine as an Kvervwom
an in the documentary, a person which
most women in America can associate
with. "1 think the narrative structure is
based on a woman's search for love.
What Stacv ultimately starts to find is
that she is searching for self-love. And
vou can't find that from other people."
■ From Porn to Pants
As of l'ebruan 2000, Valentine lias

quit the business, wrapping up produc
tion of"Red Vibe Diaries" on Valentine's
Day. She swears to never make another
film. But will she return?
"Absolutely not," s.iid Valentine. "I am
a very final person. I go by my word. I
wanted to go out with a bang. So I did
Red Vibe Diaries,' and it's really high
quality, shot on film with a big budget."
No, Valentine has no interest in main
stream films, though she does admit thai
several directors and producers have
encouraged her to puisne a career.
Instead, Valentine has taken the
entrepreneur road, starting her own
clothing company with two separate
product lines: "Good Girl" and "Bad
Ciirl."
'"(iood (.ill' is geared for college
women. 1 like to be comfortable and
have matching clothes. So 1 wanted to
start a clothing company of my own, the
way I like to dress. lank tops, shorts,
I'| s. And we spent a lot of time looking
for the fabric, because we wanted it to
feel like bulla," said Valentine. "The Bad
Girl line is sexy stuff, inainlx for club
bing."
When asked il she'll miss the business,
Valentine looks with great hope foi the
future.
"I've been doing it for four vears. It's
no longer a new, fun thing anymore,
and I've grown. I'm a different person
now," said Valentine. "I make no excus
es, no apologies For what I've done. I
don't regret anvthing. F.ven tn\ ex-hus
band. If I had it to do all over again, I
wouldn't change a thing. Otherwise I
wouldn't be talking to von. And 1
wouldn't change that for anvthing. For
god's sake, I'm speaking at Stanford
I niversitv! How incredible is that? It's
ama/ing. I can't believe I'm here!"
II The People vs. Adam Berns
As for Adam, he has a I V pilot for
Fox in the works, along with a science
fiction feature based on the best-selling
novel "Area f> 1." Adam said that though
his Internet coinpanx is very successful,
he'd still like to keep his hands in the
movie business.
Recently, Oklahoma and Kentucky
have banned "The Girl Next Door"

An interview with porno mega-star
Stacy Valentine and Adam Berns,
producer of "The Girl Next Poor"

A porn star saunters into an empty
classroom in the School of Educa
tion for a private interview. Dressed
in tight black from bust to toe, this
blonde beauty carries a bottle of
water and admits that she is ner
vous. Your savvy Intermission edi
tor calms her down, making her feel
at ease, and for the next hour, an
intensely personal conversation
unfolds about pornography, relation
ships, documentary filmmaking and
sex.

Meanwhile, a screening for Stanford
students plays in Cubberly Auditorium of
a documentary about this incredible starlet's life.
Intermission's one-hour interview remains intermission
less, so to speak, until three members of an anonymous frater
nity burst into the classroom, unexpectedly asking the celebrity
to autograph their bottoms.

Earlier in the evening, an interview was conducted with
the producer of the screened documentary. No body
parts were signed.

Adam Berns is a 1984 Stanford graduate in economics with a joint
law and MBA degree from UCLA. Currently, he is the executive
vice president of hiwire.com, an Internet startup geared at stream
ing advertisements across the web. In his downtime, Berns moonlights

"The Girl Next
Door". Not Rated.

the Lumiere in San
Francisco and the
Town 3 in San Jose

as a film producer.
Which brings us to Stacy
Valentine. Valentine, nee
Stacy Baker, is one of the
biggest porn stars in the
adult entertainment busi
ness. A contract actress
for VCA pictures, Stacy
has graced the box cov
ers of more than 40
videos, and has

appeared in over 65 adult features including "Cafe Flesh 2,'
"Red Vibe Diaries," "Devil and Mrs. Jones ti." "New Wave
Hookers 5," and "Mv Horny Valentine."

■ A Menage to Remember
Up until about four years ago, the two had about as much
in common as, well, an internet start-up exec and a porn
star.

Enter documentary filmmaker and Berns' good friend
Christine Fugate, known primarily in the PBS world for
her films "Mother Love" and "Tobacco Blues." Fugate

had a vision for a documentary of two vears in the life of
a porn film star.
Berns loved the idea, helped to fund the project, and

in her search for a subject, found Valentine.
"My manager Jack [Gallagher] told me there was a
woman who wanted to do a documentary and follow
a porn star around. And I said, 'okay,' I'll do that.
Because 1 was used to being followed around by cam
era crews on porn sets all day," said Valentine.
When Valentine agreed to allow Fugate into every
aspect of her life for two years, l'ugate invited the starlet
to a screening of her film "Mother Love."

"It was a documentary about four sets of mothers and
daughters, and I'm a momim's girl, so I was just so moved

and touched by all the emotions that Christine brought
out," said Valentine. "When the documentary was over, I
cried and called my mom and said I love you.' And I turned
to Christine and said, 'let's do this.' "

The final product of this menage-a-trois is " The Gil l Next
Door," a revealing and sometimes disturbing insider's look at

the porn business, tinged with humor, and thoroughly imbued
with humanity. Fugate stays relatively distant from her subject.

and this absence of moralizing in the film is what makes it one ol the


NATACHA POGGIO/The Stanford Daily
better documentaries in recent years.
Clu istine (lidn I want to be judgmen
tal. We ve had anti-porn people tell us
what a great anti-porn message the film
has, and al the same time, we've had
Hugh Hefner watch it and love it as well.
So I really think that people get out of it
what they want," said Herns. "It's really a
story about a woman trying to find her
way in the world, and it just so happens
to take place in the world of porn."
■ Busting into the Business
1 lie film covers a span of two years iu
Valentines life, from her early days m
the business, to her rise in fame and
recognition at the Hot IVOr Awards in
Cannes, where she was awarded the
prize for Best American Starlet. Inciden
tally, Valentine will be returning to
Cannes this year to accept the award
again.
"Over the two years, Christine went
everywhere with me. More than Julian,
actually, and I liked her better than
Julian," admitted Valentine.
Julian was Valentine s boyfriend at the
time, and fugate seems to take a partic
ular interest in him as a subject in the
film. I hat relationship falls apart in front
ol the camera's lens, as Valentine puts
her career aspirations iu front of every
thing else in her life*. Valentine admit
tedly also had major trust issues, and a
tattoo on her neck that reaffirms that.
"1 still don i trust anyone, she insisted.
"My tattoo sa\s onk trust in yourself,'
and I'll always wear that."
Valentine's abusive relationship with
her ex-husband in Oklahoma paved the
way for her entrance into the business.
Once Valentine submitted to his desires
to get breast implants and pose for an
amateur centerfold magazine contest, he
had forever lost his housewife to the
industry. Valentine almost immediately
moved out to Hollywood to became a
star. Stacy Baker become Stacy Valentine
al that point.
" There was good for Stacy in the busi
ness," said Berns. "In some way, it was
her leverage to get out of a horrible mar
riage. But you do see in the film JthatJ it
has an effect on her."
■ Close-ups from afar
Fugate is careful to keep her subject at
a reasonable distance, as filmmakers in
this form are encouraged to do. Accord
ing Lo Berns, this was especially difficult
for Fugate because of the way the film

was shot. Fugate followed Valentine vir
tually on her own for two years, with no
camera crews and only a digital video
camera which she handled herself. Nat
urally, the two formed quite a bond in
the process.
"Christine and Stacy developed a trust
relationship that was built over time.
That's why Christine wanted to shoot for
so long," said Berns. "But it became awk
ward for Christine at times because Stacy
began to view her as one of her best
friends."
Altogether, Fugate captured 130 hours
of Valentine's life on her camera over
the two years.
"It was difficult for her, because she
kept having to distance herself from me.
She could never give me advice or tell
me what to do, never really contribute,"
said Valentine. "When 1 would ask her
questions, she wouldn't tell me anything.
Now I realize why she did that, why she
didn't interfere."
Since Valentine got used to telling her
everything about her life, the two still
keep in touch on a daily basis, and now
Fugate offers advice to her friend.
Valentine has only seen the 82 min
utes of film that audiences across Ameri
ca will see, and she has little interest in
seeing the other 128 hours.
"I've only seen what made it into the
film, the final cut. I trusted Christine to
pick what she wanted to put in," said
Valentine. "It's such a weird experience
to watch it. Every time 1 see it, 1 end up
back in that spot. It's like watching a
memory that I'm thinking of."
Seeing " The Cirl Next Door" has not
only c hanged Valentine's outlook on life,
but it has also completely changed her
self-image. "Watching it is very thera
peutic," explained Valentine. "I learned
communication skills. Before, if I had a
problem, 1 would push it to the back of
my mind and not talk about it. Now peo
ple ask me why 1 did particular things in
the film, and I actually have to ask myself
why I did it. It taught me a lot about
myself. I'm much more comfortable
about the way 1 look. I don't think that
I'm ugly anymore, because I know that
I'm not ugly. I've learned that I am pret
ty. Fveryone should look at themselves
th,it way, because everyone has qualities
that makes them beautiful."
Valentine has yet to show her film to
her mother, even though her mother
talks quite openly in segments about how
proucl she is of her daughter.
"1 didn't show this to my mom because
I don't want her to see me naked, and it
would really hurt her to see the things
that 1 go though, like the plastic
surgery," said Valentine. "You have to
experience the bad times to experience

■ The Real Pornography?
One of the most shocking elements in
the film is the graphic depiction of sever
al of Valentine's plastic surgerv proce
dnres, from breast reduction to liposuc
tion to lip implants. While there is nudi
ty in the film, and plenty of it, fwgate
manages to handle ii all quite tastefully.
Ironically, these questionable gratuitous
operation scenes push moments of the
film towards borderline pornography.
"We decided to include them because 1
think it was real important to get a sense
of what this woman was willing to go
through for her body image," said
Herns. "She lias a better bod\ than 9 ( .)'/<
of the planet, and she still is getting ;ill
this surgery, for the audience to under
stand this and the compromises Stac\
takes in this business, you have to go
through what Stacy went through."
Valentine still can't watch these scenes.
She says she has a very physical reaction
to them, that instanth pulls her head
down as soon as the sequences begin.
But she insists that these are nonetheless
essential scenes to telling the story of her
lile.
"11l can affect one person to see what
this surgery is really like, then I'm
happy. Kven if 1 change the perspective
of a guv who wants his girlfriend to get
big boobs," said Valentine. "This side is
not shown ever. They don't show vou
"videos in the doctor's office. 1 hat was a
time in mv life when I was completeh
out of control."

Since Valentine first saw the film last
year, she has not returned to the plastic
surgeon, nor does she intend to -
though she still thinks her 1)1)+ breasts
(reduced in the film from K+ implants)
are too big.
■ The other porn star
"The (iirl Next Door" shares the inde
pendent film circuit this month with a
remarkably similar documentary about
the business, "Sex: I he .Annabel ('hong
Story. The Ciirl Next Door" is without
question the better film. "Sex" focuses

Annabel (Ihong, a pseudo-feminist who
gets involved in pornographv and ends
up strewing 251 men in an event billed
as "the world's largest gang-bang."
(Ihong is neither a likeable character nor
a particularly interesting subject. She's
just a depressed mess, and a real eflort
to watch.
"They are very different movies.
Annabel Chong is very nutty. She is a
profit participant iu that movie. And
she's not ver\ rclatahle bv the average
person," said Berns. "'The (iirl Next
Door' was directed In a woman, and
Stacy Valentine is relatable in main
ways. A lot of stuff that happens to her is
ver\ similar to the issues that many
women face, women that have nothing
to do with the porn business."
"Sex" director (iough Lewis also seems
to have his own agenda in the film,
exposing the pathetic and lowly of the
industry without an\ sympathy or
humanity. Fugate lets her audience
decide lor themselves.
"1 think the business is neither as bad
as people think nor as gidd\ as women
on Jem Springer make it out to be,"
offered Berns. "Almost everyone in the
business has a lot of baggage, and it lakes
a large personal toll on your life. It
desexuali/es sex. Christine wanted to
give a realistic view of the business and
let people make up theii own minds.''
Valentine had her own message to get
across: " I he industry is not what people
think. I did this documentary because I
wanted people to know that there is a
person behind the porn fantasy or
image. I'm just like you, but I have a
realls dillerent job. I'm a porn star."
Berns sees Valentine as an Kvervwom
an in the documentary, a person which
most women in America can associate
with. "1 think the narrative structure is
based on a woman's search for love.
What Stacv ultimately starts to find is
that she is searching for self-love. And
vou can't find that from other people."
■ From Porn to Pants
As of l'ebruan 2000, Valentine lias

quit the business, wrapping up produc
tion of"Red Vibe Diaries" on Valentine's
Day. She swears to never make another
film. But will she return?
"Absolutely not," s.iid Valentine. "I am
a very final person. I go by my word. I
wanted to go out with a bang. So I did
Red Vibe Diaries,' and it's really high
quality, shot on film with a big budget."
No, Valentine has no interest in main
stream films, though she does admit thai
several directors and producers have
encouraged her to puisne a career.
Instead, Valentine has taken the
entrepreneur road, starting her own
clothing company with two separate
product lines: "Good Girl" and "Bad
Ciirl."
'"(iood (.ill' is geared for college
women. 1 like to be comfortable and
have matching clothes. So 1 wanted to
start a clothing company of my own, the
way I like to dress. lank tops, shorts,
I'| s. And we spent a lot of time looking
for the fabric, because we wanted it to
feel like bulla," said Valentine. "The Bad
Girl line is sexy stuff, inainlx for club
bing."
When asked il she'll miss the business,
Valentine looks with great hope foi the
future.
"I've been doing it for four vears. It's
no longer a new, fun thing anymore,
and I've grown. I'm a different person
now," said Valentine. "I make no excus
es, no apologies For what I've done. I
don't regret anvthing. F.ven tn\ ex-hus
band. If I had it to do all over again, I
wouldn't change a thing. Otherwise I
wouldn't be talking to von. And 1
wouldn't change that for anvthing. For
