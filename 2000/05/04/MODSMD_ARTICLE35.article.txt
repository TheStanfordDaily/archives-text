# Coming back from The Edge: an era ends

### ENO SARRIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ixist Thursday, Palo .Alto lost the eldest
of its few live music venues when The
Kdge closed its doors after a Papa Roach
show.
The club ended over 10 years of sen-ice
to the community with a sold-out show
that was appropriate in so many ways.
First and foremost, the large crowd was
a young crowd. 'ITie Kdge was always a
club for those between IS and 21. It was
the only club around that let youngsters
in — and somehow that translated to
crowds that felt, well, high school. But at
least they were all psyched for Papa
Roach, and that's what counted on
Thursday.

Being an over-18 club max have been
Hie Kdge's achilles heel. Bouncers had
to make taking identification ;it the door
an arduous process to prevent underage
drinking. Also, clubs don't make much
money oil a non-drinking patron —
unless they happen to need a sixer of
Sprite at one show.
I here's even more to the age thing.
The younger generation seemed to
determine the scope of the live music
that came through.
During the I'apa Roach show, the club's
music coordinator listed what he lelt to
be the best acts that had come through
The Kdge. Smashing Pumpkins,'U I, \<>
Doubt, and last but not least, Insane
Clown Posse. Maybe it's not youth —
maybe it's just pop.
The mix of teens, pop, and punk didn't

go seemlessly for the Kdge. Big bouncers
glared from their perches with smh
looks at all the teens below them, while
go-go cages stook out like sore thumbs
from the walls. Stage di\ing wasn't
allowed (exceptions were made lor the
Papa Roach show — I even saw one of
the meat head guards dive in himself,
complete with a dolphin ki( kin the ait .
and a face-in-the-floor landing), which
made punk shows in the venue a lot less
fun. And recently, "no smoking outside'"
was added to the long list ol rules hand
ed down by the management.
My personal list of best shows .it I lie
Kdge is very different from those provid
ed by the club. I lie Donnas played a fini
show, MxPx roc kedthe house, and
I uga/i lit it on fire. The Kdge was a small
venue — it should have booked bands

that couldn't have played up the street at
Shoreline Amphitheatei. When the dub
did bring those bands, it was ,i beautiful
thing, but the dub's bookings were, in
anv case, an admirable attempt to bring
the world to Palo Alto.
Around here, you have to take the good
with the bad, because there ain't nine h of
either. If you're into punk, south of I he
('.it \ can seem to be a musical black hole.
()nce again, I'he Kdge stood against the
tide In affirming that von didn't have to
go up to the <"itv to see good musk .
Papa Roach was just punk enough to
end with, fliey played an interesting
mix ol rap and metal, and therefore
cover I'lie Edge's
