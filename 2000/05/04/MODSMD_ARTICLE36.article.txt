"(iodspell," the musical reenaclment
of the (iospel according to Matthew
that ran on Broadway for over 2,500
performances in the mid-'7os, has
come to Palo Alto, (.ranted, the cast
members have changed and some of
the pop culture references have been
updated — two notable examples
include references to "Pokemon" and
the theme music from "Jeopardy" —
but the basic universal teaching of the
production has endured the test of
time: be loving and joyous, not hateful
and sacl.
Simple as the lesson may sound, the
I3 exuberant cast members in "(iod
spell" are anything but one-dimension
al. Originally conceived and adapted
by John-Michael lebelak, the produc
tion vividly brings the parables of Jesus
Christ alive through stirring song and
well-choreographed dance. Set in con
temporary times (actually in the '70s,
but contemporary in comparison to the
time when Christ really lived), the play
incorporates a smorgasbord of comedy,
pantomime, vaudeville and tap danc
ing to help tell the story of Christ's last
seven clays on earth.
1 lie series of mini-ac ts performed by
the eclectically and colorfully dressed
cast are set to an equally varied selec
tion of music, including roc k, pop, bal
lad, and even a bit of rap. Steven
Schwartz, who also composed the
music for the Broadway musical "Pip
pin" and the Disney animations "Poca
hontas'' and"The I lunchhac k of Notre

Dame," composed the
memorable music and
new lyrics lor the pro
duction.
I he scenes in "God
spell" cater to an audi
ence ol all ages. Early
on, you've got Jesus

ta. ★★★★☆ —

teaching his ragtag group ol disciples
through a c hildren's game of charades.
Shortly after, you're watt lung the disc i
ples play-act as school children. While
they bicker with one another and try to
avoid being sent to time-out, |esus
attempts to teach them the traditional
lessons on laith and goodness.
However, "(iodspell" is not all child's
play. Ac l Iwo opens with a boa-clad cast
and a silll l \' and seductive temptress,
Margo Sc hembre, throwing herself at
Christ. Scheinbre gave the finest per
formance of the players, stealing the
attention of the audience in nearly
every scene. Alter her riotous routine,
attention is again diverted by the
melodic and soothing performance of
the popular ballad "By My Side." But
the audience isn't subdued lor long. In
the following scene, you've got Jesus
back to his playful ways, doing a conta
gious impersonation of a lamb.
I hroughoul all the lolly, adults and
children alike were laughing out loud
and tapping their feet to the upbeat
and infectious tunes chronicling
Christ's time among us. No doubt
there will be a few l'alo Allans in hot
pursuit ol the "(iodspell" soundtrack at
the local record store in the weeks to
come.
