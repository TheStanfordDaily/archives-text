## Suffering from excessive creativity 
### RANDY MANO STAFF WRITER 
A description of "Time Code"
leads one to have unexpectedly
high expectations for such a dur
ing move by writer-director Mike
Figgis. The film, largely impro
vised by the 2K actors, is shot
entirely by four digital cameras
in real-time. Furthermore, these
four stories are shown simultane
ously on the screen, which is split
into quadrants.
At first, the effect is confusing.
Voices and movement are
picked up in bits and pieces, and
the eyes — used to focusing on
one scene at a time — have their
choice of four. What eventually
happens is a gradual adjustment,
and then a selective process
where one chooses what scene to
watch. Imagine three scenes with
relatively mundane action and
one with Jeanne Tripplehorn and
Salma Hayek making out in the
back seat of a limo. Hmm, tough
call there.

Tripplehorn is a particular
joy to watch as Lauren, a girl
friend so suspicious of her sig-

nificant other that she wire
taps her with a hidden
microphone. Her talents as
a pure actor outshined the
majority of participants in
"Time Code." Equally
amusing is Quentin (Julian
Sands), a masseur with act
ing aspirations hired to take
care of the serious-minded
film executives at the low
brow Red Mullet, which is
Figgis' real-life production
company.
The main fault of "Time
Code" lies with its relatively
weak characters and disap-

pointing plot line. Pre
dictably enough, the cameras

all converge on the same scene, as
if to say with gusto that paths in
life tend to cross, liven more
troubling is the blandness of wife
Emma (Saffron Burrows) and up
and-coming actress Rose (Salma
I layek), two central characters of
the mayhem in Los Angeles.
More out of Holly Hunter, an
Oscar winner from " I he Piano,"
and less from Stellan Skarsgard,
ove rm ate lied

in his complex role, would
also have been good moves.
One of the most clever
scenes is the self-mocking
pitch of a digital, split
screen film by a video direc
tor and her rap musician
boyfriend. Ana (Mia Mae
stro) and Joey Z (Alessan
dro Nivola) have all the
arrogance and new-age pre
tentiousness one might
expect from cutting-edge
indie artists. It's unfortu
nate this jubilant, down-to
earth humor gets lost in

"Time Code," a 93-minute
exercise in what happens when
too much ingenuity and freedom

are injected into a

movie project
At a recent

preview
screening,

the biggest surprise of the night
did not come from the movie, but
rather from the announcement
that Figgis, best known for his
success with "Leaving Las
Vegas," was in the audience. Fig
gis treated the screening audience
to a question-and-answer session
and his own live jazz mix to
"Time Code," a thoroughly
unique and tepid effort.
