# Rambling plot makes finding the 'Heart' of this movie tough
## 
### CHANEY RANKIN STAFF WRITER 
It's a great premise for a comedy: a barefoot and preg
nant yonng redneck abandoned at a Wal-Mart by liei
feckless boyfriend, her road trip to California abruptly cut
sbort in Oklahoma. She takes tip residence in and even
tually gives birth at the megastore. Funny, right?
Sort of. "Where the 1 lean Is," an adaptation of the novel
by liillie Letts, uses this device, which is funny in theory,
to jumpstart a tired feel-good cliick flick. Another book-to
movie transition gone wrong, this movie leaves you won
dering why you should really care about any of the char
acters at all.
I he Wal-Mart birth is just the beginning of a coming-of
age story about Novalee Nation (Natalie I'ortinan), who
makes unlikely friends in Oklahoma: Sister Husband
(Stockard (lhamiing), a recovering alcoholic and woman
of (iod who prays daily for forgiveness lot the sex she has
with her lover on the kitchen table; Lexie (loop (Ashley
|udd), single mother of five (or so) who names her myri
ad offspring after candy bars; and Forney Hull (James
I tain), a tortured librarian who naturally burns with pas
sion lot young Novalee, despite their differences in edu
cation.
It's easy to tell that this amusing cast of characters makes
a great book; sadly, it's not enough for a movie. A plot
would help, hut this one mainly consists of random
instances of joy and hardship. We're thrown back and forth
between the two with very little change in the movie's tone;
near the middle, my friend and I were taking bets as to
what crisis would next befall this merry band.
The movie is by no means unwatt liable; 1 laughed quite
a few times, particularly at Channing's excellent work as
an understated comic figure. Joan Cusack makes a won
derful appearance as the manager of Novalee's villanous
boyfriend, who has gone to Nashville to become a country
singer. Sadly, that particular subplot is apparently irrele
vant to the film, except for a blatant tie-in at the end.
The rest of the talented cast has been given little to work
with. Director Matt Williams' ham-handed touch is evi
dent throughout; we are expected to laugh here, cry
there, and gasp in surprise at the plot twists, which come
along often enough to stop causing surprise. While
