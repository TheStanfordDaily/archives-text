# Spacey makes 'Kahuna' shine
## 
### MICHAEL BAER STAFF WRITER 
"The Big Kahuna" stands out, not only lor pre
dictably great performances hy Danny De\ ito and
Kevin Space)', but also lor its subject mallei, its
humor, its insight, and just how enjoyable ii is.
It tells the tale of three salesmen, working Ibr an
industrial lubricant company, all trying to land a big
sale — thus the title of the film. I here are two old
friends — the polite and pensive I'liil (De\ ito) and the
blunt and high-strung liirry (Spacey) — plus a new
kid, Hob (Peter Facinelli). Grounded in faith and
happ\ in marriage, Bob seems read) to leain as inuc Ii
as possible about lube sales and as little as possible
about life. Of course, events conspire to do just the
opp< >siie.
Both of the older men are going through life
changes — giving up drinking, smoking, and maybe
even the business — though the) re both well-ground
ed and exceptional!) honest guys. I lirough a night ol
tracking down the Big Kahuna and trying to secure
that vital sale, they reveal their respective strengths
and weaknesses, and learn a lot from one another.
()ne of the most interesting aspects ol the film is that
it mostly takes place in one room, with various c ombi
nations of the three actors present. I his is no accident,
as the film is based on a play, "I lospitalit) Suite.
As with niaiiv plays, there's ven little ac(ion and a lot
of talk. It is a movie of small tensions and subtle wis
dom. I he material is probabh better suited for stage
than for screen, but getting Space) and Devito to do
this ever)' nigh I in various cities wouldn't be a terribl)
workable prospect. And othei actors just wouldn I
compare.
Make no mistake, though: the plot is important and
the film is engaging, not just the three characters
spouting their philosophies. Indeed, .ill three perlbr
mances bring the film to life: DeVito in particular
gives a moving performance as someone w ho has lost
much of what he thought of as his life and w ho con
siders ridding himself of even more.
An appropriate song closes the picture — one based
on an essay entitled, "Advice, Like Youth, Probably
Just Wasted on the Noting." It's unclear at the end
what each character will do with the advice given and
lessons learned in that night. But tlie\ do learn, from
others' mistakes, experiences, or advice. ()r their own.
llie viewer should come away with a similarly
changed viewpoint. And that is something only a small
proportion of today's movies oiler.
