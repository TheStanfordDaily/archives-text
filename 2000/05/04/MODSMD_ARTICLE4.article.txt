# Program center in works between Wilbur, Stern
## 
### TOMOKO SAKAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In response to demands for increased student space
in Tresidder, the ASSL and some administrators are
planning a new student center in the parking lot area
between Wilbur and Stern I tails.
" The East Campus Student Program Center will be
designed to alleviatelthe pressing demands tor student
space of .ill types on the Stanford campus meeting
space, storage space, office space and rehearsal space,"
said ASSI Vice President John Mills, a doctoral stu
dent in genetics.
"The location was chosen to bring to the east side of
campus what the Elliott Program Center currently pro
vides for the west side of campus, and also to provide
more student space that [will be] conveniently accessi
ble to graduate students living in nearby Escondido
Village and the Rains Houses," Mills said.
With limited space available for purely student use
in Tresidder, growing numbers of students have ex
pressed the need for more space for student organiza
tions around campus.
"It's going to be a long process, but unlike Tresid
der, the ideal of the new student center is that it be sole
ly directed by and for the purpose of students," said ju
nior Seth Newton, ASSL 1 president-elect.
Administrators have expressed support for the pro
posal as well.
"Although this proposal is in a very preliminary
stage, we've talked to [Vice Provost for Student Affairs]
James Montoya, and lie has expressed interest in the
need for a more comprehensive student space," said
Keith Cuy, associate vice provost for housing and din
ing services.
There are several issues the University must consid
er in building an entirely new student center.
"Although the vice provost agreed to this plan, he
decided that it is crucial to consider it in a larger con
text," Guy said. "Instead of an entirely new building,
we also have the options of remodeling and renovating
Tresidder, or constructing new sites in White Plaza in
stead of East Campus."
" There are also considerations about the current

community centers, like the Women's Center and the
Black Community Services Center," Newton said.
"A lot of them are under-funded, and we can't ne
glect those organizations and start building a new stu
dent union in the interest of others," he said.
Deputy Undergraduate Senate Chair Ben Liu, a ju
nior who recently lost his bid for the ASSU presidency,
also had put forth a proposal for a new student center
on his campaign agenda.
I.iu said concerns were raised over the issue of stu
dent participation in planning the project.
"The current Tresidder is clearly not meant for stu
dents' facilities. It's a confined space with [t(x> many]
vendors, and there clearly is a need for an improved
student union," Liu said. "However, 1 feel there is an
absolute lack of student involvement in this issue and
more of us should be consulted regarding how, when
and what is going to be done."
"The process is going in the right direction, but it
needs to be driven by more students, not just the .ASSU
and the administrations," he said.
Cuv agreed, saying, "It is University space and
needs approval of University officials in its decision
making, but student inputs are crucial t(x>," he said.
Any proposed completion date would be several
years away.
"Through the efforts of the Stanford Lating Cluljs
Working Croup," Mills said, "the square footage for
the new student center was included in Stanford's Gen
eral Use Permit application to Santa Clara County.
Once fundraising considerations have been worked
out, the new student center could be built any time
within the next 10 years, which is the duration of the
Ceneral Use Permit."
As the ASSU and the University both concede, the
plan lor a new student center in Last Campus is still in
its infancy stage.
As Mills emphasized, the proposal is only feasible to
the extent of student effort and involvement.
"We submitted our recommendation for the con
struction of the center to the administration in January,
and response has since been positive. It's up to us, our
successors in the ASSU and students concerned with
space issues to keep the pressure on," he said.
