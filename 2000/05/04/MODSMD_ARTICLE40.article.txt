### LAUREN RUSELL EDITORIAL STAFF 
" I'lie Gladiator" will open this weekend with a much
deserved bang. Not onlv does Russell (iiovve, who plays
the war hero Maximus Decimus Meridins (the gladia
tor), bring his standard badass bravado and glistening
hard body to the screen, but the entire cast pulls the
story together with seamless acting performances.
" The Gladiator" is a "Braveheart "-esque epic ston
set in Ancient Rome, lull of the to-be-expected bloody
battle scenes and serious dramatic moments that make
you want to st ream "freedom!" I lie set (which includes
a reconstructed (loliseum) and costumes (whi( h are, f<>l
the most part, exquisite recreations of \ncicnt Roman
royal garb) are impressive in themselves, but it is realh
the testosterone-pumped ston that will wow audiences
(at least those with significant levels of testosterone in
their systems).
Joaquin Phoenix plays Coinniodus. the newly
crowned Roman Ceasar aft ei he jealoush murders his
father, Kiuperor Marcus Aurelius. Crowe plavs an
"Insider" again, as his character Maximus is the only
one who knows that he himself was set to take ovei the
throne once Aurelius dies, but is also the onl\ one who
knows that the true murderer is the jealous and genet
ically rightful heir to the throne, Com modus. Because
the morally bankrupt Commodus sees Maximus as a
threat to his seat on the throne, he banishes Maximus
into slavery and has his lamil) brutalb murdered.
1 lie rest of the story follows the struggles thai Max
imus encounters as he works his way back to Rome. Ini
tially, Maximus simply wants to survive, but once lie
regains his strength and sense of purpose as a trained
gladiator, lie dec ides that he is going to work his way all
the way to the throne that he deserves to sit on. I lie
majority of the film follows this journey through ancient
Rome, which is much more class-conscious than mod
ern-day society. As a slave who is lore ed to fight against
the strongest warriors in the Roman empire, Maximus
has little chance to get very far, much less live.
Comparing "Ciladiator" to "Braveheart" is going a
little too far, but this film is one of the better ones to
come out so far this year. "Gladiator" definitely has an
uneven gore to sex ratio, and the- romance in the film is
pretty much nonexistent; but I still suspect that female
audiences will enjoy taking in a sweaty ( iowe as he- bat
tles passionately in his gladiatoi garb. Men and women
both tend to enjoy watching Crowe for the same reason
â€” lie is completely hardcore, and he fits the role of the
classical hero to a I. In other words, men want to be
him, women want to be with him.
" The Ciladiator" will appeal to widely varied audi
ences because it is a universal talc- of good against evil.
That, along with a strong cast and beautiful cinemato
graphic imagery, is worth getting out lor this weekend.
