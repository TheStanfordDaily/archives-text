## Give the Pumpkins a chance 
### MIA YOU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Everybody seems to Ik- down on
the Smashing Pumpkins lately -
especially following the release of
their disappointing 1998 effort,
"Adore." Their newest release,
"MACHINA/the machines of
God," hasn't been getting much
better reviews.
These reviews, however, should
not deter listeners from trying the
album themselves. "MAC! UNA"
offers several new, surprisingly
good tracks and shows that the
group has worked hard to polish
their new sound. l.ead singer Billy
('.organ begins the album with
"You know I'm not dead/ Now you
know where I've been." Maybe
now is a good time to get teac
quainted with the Smashing Puntp
kins.
In MACHINA, the Pumpkins
regain some of the hard-edged,
harsh sound that they lost in Adore
while also maintaining lyricism and
emotion in their tracks. While
"Raindrops + Sunshowers" and
"Age of Innocence" are fairly simi
lar to traditional Pumpkins songs,
the first single of this album, "The
Everlasting Gaze," has a much grit
tin and sharper feel, flic Pump
kins experiment a lot on this track
with intonation, discord and phras
ing. "Try, Try, Try," on the other
hand, is much more likely to be a
mainstream hit. Although the first
lines of the track, "Pop Tart/ What's
our mission?" are enough to make
even a Hanson fan wary, the song

has ;i cat< hy melody <md the l\ iii s
later improve signili< antly. "Try.
I ry, I ry" luts the same themes ol
nostalgia lor Middle America that
runs through their Pumpkins pre
vious hit, "1979."
(Morgan's lyrics range from
insightful and provocative to

(lulled and ridiculous. In
"Wound." dorian announces:
"List night I turned around and
thought I saw myself turning." lie
redeems himself in the same track,
however, through his interesting
use of syntactical rhythm, rather
than depending purely on melodic

rhythm, in later lyrics.
Two obvious themes run through
the "MACHINA" album: a fascina
tion with religion and excitement at
being in love. Although the album
title is both appropriate and inter
esting, sometimes the Pumpkins go
a little overboard in tying in their
songs to this deistic theme. In
"Glass and the Ghost Children,"
(Morgan sings, "So I'm operating on
the premise/ That I'm hearing the
voice of God/. . . Thinking my life
has importance." Corgan's love
songs, however, are refreshing.
"Stand Inside Your Love," which is
currently receiving wide radio play,
and "With Every Light" are the best
two tracks on the album. "With
Every Light," in particular, features
an uncharacteristically cheerful
Corgan who sings about the "sun
shining on me" and four-leaf
clovers. While this may be too
sappy for traditional Pumpkin fans,
I personally think the song was
very well done.
Although this album technically
took eight months to complete, sev
eral of "MACHINA's" songs were
featured on the Spring 1999 "Aris
ing!" tour. The Pumpkins also plan
to tour internationally this year,
including a concert at the Berkeley
(lommunity Theater on May 24.
