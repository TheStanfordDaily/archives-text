The name may not he familiar, hut the sax
sure is. As a sax man for James Brown in the
late '60s and early '70s, Mateo Parker's
( hops were appreciated hy many, on die
road, on the radio, and oil record, lie latei
collaborated with Parliament/Funkadclit
and Bootsy Collins during the late 70s, onl\
to disappear with the '80s.
However, in the '90s, lie's made a hit of a
comeback, releasing several critically
acclaimed albums, and, in 1090, collaborat
ing with such singers as Ani l)iFranco and
the Artist Formerly Known as Prince. I heir
furious fbllowings assured his recognition hv
a larger (and younger) audience than has

known him in 20 years.
All this is the prelude to
2000's star-studded "Dial
M-A-C-F-()." llie Artist
and Ani are here, return
ing the favor, and lie's also
joined by Sheryl Crow and
James Fay lor.
