Vicki Richards' Temple Dwellers"
is a unique art form in itself. Blending
her impressive professional back
ground in classical violin with her
more recent training in North Indian
classical violin, along with the superb
collaborative talents of electric guitarist
Amitava Chatterjee, drummer Robert
rhomas Jr. (t> 112 Weather Report
"fame"), and highly-talented labia play
er I im Richards, "Temple Dwellers"
develops a sound that breaks the
boundaries of any standard musical
category.
Richards' career may explain the
complexity and imagination that
comes across in her art. At the age of
nineteen, she had already established a
professional career as a classical violin
ist, having toured Furope and becom
ing the youngest member It) join the
Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra.

Influenced heavily by jazz contemporaries
like Herbie Hancock and John Mc Laughlin,
she began to experiment with sound and
commissioned a custom-built, solid body elec
tric violin with quadrophonic pic k-ups, and
plugged it in to a wah-wah pedal and Fender
amp. She then began to collaborate with
more jazz-oriented musicians (like Thomas
Jr.) and with musicians trained in Indian
music (like Chatterjee and Tim Richards),
and developed something entirely new to the
music world.
"Temple Dwellers" is the culmination of

decades of experimentation and heaps of
musical talent. Richards uses her violin to cre
ate a wide variety of effects, both electrifying
and calming. "Temple Dwellers" has melodi
ous tracks that are soothing enough to guar-

antee you wonder
ful dreams if you lis
ten to tliein while
going to bed. like
"We 11 sp t ing ,"
"Naima" and
"Montserrat." hut

an album created to put anyone to
sleep —the relaxing pieces are inter
spersed with songs full of elaborate
drumming and penetrating guitar sec
tions, coupled with Richards' distinctive
electric violin, which can only be
described as extremely alive and
poignantly stirring.
My favorite parts of the album are
Richards' three interpretations of
Ravel pieces. They are distinctively
more classical than the rest of the
album, and bring three recognizable
Ravel songs alive with beautiful vibran
cy. In these songs we see how incredi
bly talented Richards has, as she can
pull off c lassic al violin like a traditional
master and also dive deeply into more
experimental, clearly un-classical
sounds.
The album ends with the track
" Temple Dwellers," which is a haunt
ing, slow song full of vocals and a wide
variety of rhythm instruments.
Richards displays her deeply-rooted

interest in Native American cultures in
this piece, which culminates in an increasing
ly hypnotic pounding of drums. If you like
Robbie Robertson's recent work, you will love
this song.

" Temple Dwellers" is a mas
terpiece in both its musical crafts
manship and its never-before
heard sound. Its mesmerizing
sounds will liven up your days
and stay with you in your
dreams. I highly reccomend giv
ing it a listen.
