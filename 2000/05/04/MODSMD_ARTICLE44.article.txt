# Tina's back, but hardly in force

### MICHAEL BAER STAFF WRITER 
Tina's back! After her '60s and '70s Ike and Tina suc
cess and subsequent solo comeback in the '80s, Tina
Turner is certainly one of our most enduring pop stars.
At 61, she's also possibly the oldest female singer still con
sidered a sex symbol, as witnessed by the many body
shots in the liner notes for her new album, " Twenty Tour
Seven."
Sadly, though, she's never matched either the success
or the greatness of 1984's "Private Dancer." In the last
decade, her only fresh album was 1996's "Wildest
Dreams," which was largely ignored.
Now - with a tour and a guest spot on an episode of Ally
Mcßeal — Tina's " Twenty Tout Seven" is another bid at
a comeback for the artist now known as simply 'Tina.
And, in better hands, it might have been one. As it is, the
subpar production bogs down songs that do little more
than let Tina stroll — albeit a feistily — through them.
The songs themselves are not the best material Tina lias
been presented with in her career. They're not very
interesting and decidedly middle-of-the-road. Most work
only superficially — pleasing and occasionally passionate
songs about love, loss, and survival.
Of course, all this might be forgivable given Tina's
golden pipes. But we only hear those through a filter of
cliche-ridden musical accompaniment. It's the kind that
might have worked in the early '80s - when such tech
niques were fresh. But, as it is, " I wenty Tour Seven" is a
glossy yet muted affair, keeping the lid on a talent that
still has the potential to boil over.
On the plus side, it does stand up to repeated listen
ings, and, if you ignore its overall mediocrity, it can pro
vide some enjoyable moments. Whether chiding men on
"When the Heartache is Over" and "Absolutely Noth
ing's Changed" or waiting for them to come around on
"Whatever You Need" and " Talk to my Heart," Tina can
provide the soundtrack for many a melodramatic or
enipassioned moment.
In fact, most songs would fit nicely on lite rock radio,
between Kenny G and

Celine Dion. And that,
for a woman who once
delivered "Proud
Mary," "What's Love
Clot to Do With It?"
and "Simply The
Best," is simply disap
pointing.
