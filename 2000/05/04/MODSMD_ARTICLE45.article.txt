# 4 Human Traffic' a fast-paced look at the British club (and drug)
## 
### LUKE MINER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sporting a trendy jean jacket, carefully styled
blond hair and a large amount of youthful exu
berance, first-time director Justin Kerrigan
looks like he should be working in a hip London
club, not in the film industry. So it comes as lit
tle surprise that his new film "Human Traffic"
with its intense techno soundtrack, its surreal
visuals and its unapologetic depiction of drug
use, has more in common with England's "rave"
scene than it does with the average British film.
After over a decade of ecstasy culture in both
Europe and the U.S., it is the first film to
explore the day-to-day lives of British clubbers.
Although occasionallv falling prey to sentimen
tality, "Human Traffic" is for the most part an
exciting and often hilarious roller coaster ride
through the U.K. s flourishing dance culture.
"Human Traffic" tells the story of five close
friends as they embark upon an intense week
end of partying. During t he work week they are
stuck in dead end jobs selling hamburgers, jeans
and records, waiting for Friday night when thev
can let loose and forget, if for only a brief
moment, their everyday worries. From getting
"pissed" at bars to breaking into exclusive clubs,
112 rom taking exorbitant amounts of drugs on Fri
day to crashing off cocaine the next clay,
"Human Traffic" shows us the tips and clowns,
ins and outs, of this last paced lifestyle. Many
ci itics have accused the movie of not having a
plot. The protagonist Jip's struggle to overcome
a bad case of "Mr. Floppy" (i.e., impotence) is
the closest thing that "Human Traffic" has to a
conventional story line. Yet somehow in this
case, a plot doesn't seem necessary to capture
the lives of these young Brits.
There is much in "Human Traffic " for Kerri
gan to be proud of. His tendency to switch
between fantasy and pseudo-documentary styles
is au excellent and highly original way to devel
op his characters. The highlight of the film is the
relationship between Jip and his best friend
Koop. Whether they're rolling spliffs at a party
or verbally sparring in the car, their conversa
tion is so natural that you'd think both actors
had been best friends since childhood.
Kerrigan accomplished this feeling by
encouraging the cast to fraternize after hours:
"At the end of the shoot every dav we'd go back

to the same crunnm hotel and get pissed and
stoned at the bar . . . and bring some of that back
into the film." During the shoots he'd tr\ to
bring some of this newfound camaraderie out b\
"throwing] something a little different in
between each take" and encouraging his ac tors
to improvise.
Tilled with numerous scenes depic ting graph

Kerrigan, "The irony \n«is when the film did

paigns, were praising it."

film's IJ.S. distributors), nia\ fear audience reac -

showing us tli.it one of the main characters is a

" I he reason that scene was cut wasn't because
he was a drug dealer. It was because the lan

guage was so colloquial," says Kerrigan. "We

Sporting a trendy jean jacket, carefully styled
blond hair and a large amount of youthful exu
berance, first-time director Justin Kerrigan
looks like he should be working in a hip London
club, not in the film industry. So it comes as lit
tle surprise that his new film "Human Traffic"
with its intense techno soundtrack, its surreal
visuals and its unapologetic depiction of drug
use, has more in common with England's "rave"
scene than it does with the average British film.
After over a decade of ecstasy culture in both
Europe and the U.S., it is the first film to
explore the day-to-day lives of British clubbers.
Although occasionallv falling prey to sentimen
tality, "Human Traffic" is for the most part an
exciting and often hilarious roller coaster ride
through the U.K. s flourishing dance culture.
"Human Traffic" tells the story of five close
friends as they embark upon an intense week
end of partying. During t he work week they are
stuck in dead end jobs selling hamburgers, jeans
and records, waiting for Friday night when thev
can let loose and forget, if for only a brief
moment, their everyday worries. From getting
"pissed" at bars to breaking into exclusive clubs,
112 rom taking exorbitant amounts of drugs on Fri
day to crashing off cocaine the next clay,
"Human Traffic" shows us the tips and clowns,
ins and outs, of this last paced lifestyle. Many
ci itics have accused the movie of not having a
plot. The protagonist Jip's struggle to overcome
a bad case of "Mr. Floppy" (i.e., impotence) is
the closest thing that "Human Traffic" has to a
conventional story line. Yet somehow in this
case, a plot doesn't seem necessary to capture
the lives of these young Brits.
There is much in "Human Traffic " for Kerri
gan to be proud of. His tendency to switch
between fantasy and pseudo-documentary styles
is au excellent and highly original way to devel
op his characters. The highlight of the film is the
relationship between Jip and his best friend
Koop. Whether they're rolling spliffs at a party
or verbally sparring in the car, their conversa
tion is so natural that you'd think both actors
had been best friends since childhood.
Kerrigan accomplished this feeling by
encouraging the cast to fraternize after hours:
"At the end of the shoot every dav we'd go back

to the same crunnm hotel and get pissed and
stoned at the bar . . . and bring some of that back
into the film." During the shoots he'd tr\ to
bring some of this newfound camaraderie out b\
"throwing] something a little different in
between each take" and encouraging his ac tors
to improvise.
Tilled with numerous scenes depic ting graph
ic drug use, "Human Traffic"' nia\ not be right
lor some people. (her the course of one evening
|ip takes a plethora of drugs ranging from ecsta-

sy and c ocaine to
marijuana and
alcohol. Accord
ing to Kerrigan:

"We couldn't
get an\ fund
ing for the film
at all (at first)
because it
wasn't moralistic
about the use

of recreation
al drugs."

.Alt hough
it portra\ s

(I r u g

th e

director doesn't believe
"Human I raflie" has a pro-drug message. "I
was jusi trying to document an authentic week
end based upon authentic experiences." sa\s
Kerrigan, "The irony \n«is when the film did
come out it wasn't controversial. Even the right
wing tabloids, who were waging anti-rave cam
paigns, were praising it."
Yet Kerrigan, or more precisely Miramax (the
film's IJ.S. distributors), nia\ fear audience reac -
tion to "Human Traffic" in America: a scene
showing us tli.it one of the main characters is a
dt ug dealer was cut from the American release.
" I he reason that scene was cut wasn't because
he was a drug dealer. It was because the lan

guage was so colloquial," says Kerrigan. "We
played ("Human I raflic ') a couple of times in
America and the audience was |ust waiting for
