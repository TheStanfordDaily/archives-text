"The difference between pornography
and erotica is lighting."
—Gloria Leonard
She's outside stomping grapes. I lu* purple juices are
00/ ing down her hare legs, and she's laughing in
delight. I hat's page MM in Playboy's April 2000 issue.
On page 10 1, she's in the bedroom, flowers pinned in
liei (url\ blond bait , holding a rounded breast in one
hand and touching heisell between the legs with her
othei hand. I lie lighting in liei hail makes her look
like an angel.
She's beautilnl. I let sweet, genuine smile makes her
look like thi' kind of woman you'd like to take home to
iiioiii and dad. She's also naked in a magazine with a
(iK illation of will ovei three million viewers . . . or
"readers."
Yes, Mis> Sass lias spent the last few days looking at
pictures ol naked women, a populai pastime for cen
-1111 us. I lie female body, with its soft curves and hidden
mysteries, makes ail ideal artistii subject — not as

though Miss Sass is idling vou anything yon haven't

admire lu'iself: hei se\nalit\ is so overpowering!
I nlort unaielv, the lemale mule is often objectified more
ill,in admired in these representations. I his tradition is one

like Titian. I hose of von in 1-111 M may note that his "Venus

in some men's entertainment magazines.

■ On Nudity in Magazines
Miss Sass enjoved displaying men "s magazines prominently
in hei room, espceialK w lien I lie guvs ac ross the hall seemed
anxious about it — anxious enough lo ask why Miss Sass had
—lliciu. VVbv should n't Miss Sass, who appreciates die beauty
.V'wVSnirniN naked l>o?l\ as much as nnv nftier breast corF

noisseur, have such magazines? "Because it's weird to see a
girl looking at pornography . . . and I don't think the maga
zine's intention is art," one boy said. loo bad. Clearly these
magazines are perceived to have a sexual purpose rather
than one of admiration.
On page 79 of the April Playboy two women pose naked
under an umbrella, their breasts pointing perkily toward the
camera. "Stephanie" has a raincoat covering the valley
between her legs, but "Brandy" doesn't leave much of any
thing to the imagination. In fact, if you look closely (which
Miss Sass has been doing) you can see her clitoris protruding
from between her outer vaginal lips.
Upon close examination of the vaginas of several porn stars
and Playboy Playmates, Miss Sass has come to the shocking
conclusion that their vaginas don't lool< like hers\ Certainly every
woman's vulva is unique. Some women's outer vaginal lips
cover the inner lips completely; other women have inner lips
that are much bigger than their outer lips. All of these dif
ferences, as well as differences in the sizes of clitorises or
vaginal openings, are perfectly normal.
Regardless, Miss Sass finds it interesting to note that nearly
all the vaginas of porn stars and Playboy Playmates have
inner lips that exceed the size of the outer lips, and often cli
torises that are considerably larger than the one Miss Sass
and most women she knows sport around.
Miss Sass's girl friend took a look at Playboy and pointed
out, "These women have gargantuan nipples! And where's
her pubic hair? She looks like a five-year-old!" Indeed, most
of the women are either shaved, or their pubic hair is dyed
to match their skin tones.
Miss Sass can think of a few reasons why the models might
have such large inner lips and no pubic hair. Obviously, it
makes for better viewing, even if it's unrealistic. Possibly men
have qualms about ttoeir inability to fifid a cfiloris, "sfvthose

that are as large as small penises make them feel more
confident about their abilities. Apparently, the inner
vagina is more interesting to contemplate than the outer
vagina, likely because it is even more forbidden.
Despite the fact that Playboy likes models with obvious
clitorises (or maybe the woman is asked to yank hers out
before the picture is taken . . . hmnim . . .), at least the
magazine attempts to portray her in a realistic way, often
featuring the centerfold fully clothed in some shots. Rob,
Miss Sass's contact at Playboy, insisted that the magazine
strives to be different from magazines like Penthouse and
Hustler.
Penthouse tends to show the whole body of the woman,
and there may be two girls in one scene. Jackie at Pent
house said, "Penthouse is fearless in its approach to
uncovering the truth about everything from the CIA to
the Mafia. The magazine is also fearless in its pictorials,
which are considered more explicit than those in Play
boy."
Hustler is more explicit yet, sometimes featuring close
ups of intercourse — two genitals conversing without
bodies attached. Hustler was the first national magazine
to "show pink" — the euphemism for exposing the

female genitalia in nude layouts.
These two magazines often show pictures of women
spreading their vaginal lips for the camera. Honey, some
people may want to see that, but Miss Sass isn't interested.
Ladies, when's the last time you got in bed with a guy, spread
your legs and lips as wide as they would go and said, "Look
at me!" Most of us, even Miss Sass, have some degree of hes
itation about such blatant acts.
Miss Sass doesn't discourage the use of any pornography;
certainly it's not "abnormal." And if that's what makes you
hot, by all means go for it. At the same time, Miss Sass is a
proponent of intimacy in sexual relationships, and maga
zines like Playboy cater to this desire more effectively. The
image of a naked woman standing up and facing you allows
for the possibility of a fantasy, wherein you are walking
toward this woman. A close-up of a woman's spread vagina
without a face attached to it objectifies this body part and
makes sex seem very impersonal.
Besides, Playboy features articles to stir your intellect, in
case the pictures don't stir your head enough. Says one Stan
ford Playboy subscriber: "I read the Playboy Forum to learn
more about social, political, and economic issues. In addi
tion. there at e pictures of very beautiful women. However, it
is not a beat-off rag. If I wanted to find hardcore porn, I
would use the Internet. Basically, I read Playboy for the
same reason as I read the 112 ront page of the New York Times:
it has well-informed, well-argued viewpoints."
So the next time you see a guy heading to the bathroom
with a New York Times . . .
