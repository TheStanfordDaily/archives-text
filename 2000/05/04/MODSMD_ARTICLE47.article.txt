11 \ ,iiid win me .i pri/e on one ol them
new-fancied sweepstakes sites.
I should have kn own how it w.is

Your name, vonr e-mail, vont age,

And \on ilnnight no i>ne cared.
It's the advertising companies thai
want to know. I hc\ want to direct
tlieii little campaigns at the correct
demographies and sink tlieii hooks
into \i>ii. I lie more the\ know about

\ou know what I'm talking about.
So bold on to voui information, and show some chastity. Don't
|nst give \oiii info up to everyone. I did, and now I have a mil
lion e-mails about prodiu ts to show for it.
And what did 1 get out of giving it up? No free crap vet. I
signed up with www.luckx surf.com first. I'hey've got a daily
draw lot big bucks, and vou can play a free number daily after
vou iegistei and divulge vour precious bio for them. But then
again, aren't vou more likeh to be hit b\ lightning?
www'.uproar.com is almost a portal for play-to-win sites, as it
boasts links to lotto and sweepstakes pages. 1 got caught on the
bingo page. Yes, bingo. I came out of a ha/e of numbers after a
(ouple bundled games and lelt like I was real old.
II vou re into sports, and I am, there does actuallv seem to be
a site in this genre worth clunking out. www.plax toxvinsports.
com is a haven for the sports nut. You can check your hand at
ti ivia <|uestions that entei vou into drawings (if you answer cor
rect l\'. of course). I here's also a prediction section w here you
< an ( bet k vour < lairvovance against fellow mental jocks. Or see
exact l\ what e\er\one else is thinking with I licit sports polls,
lint sta\ awa\ it \oii don't like spoils — all you can win is a trip
to the N BA finals.
I lie best site ot the play-for-pi i/es genre is easily

Www .iwin.com. Their selection of games is without peer. You
can play any game from Vegas — all the way down to baccarat.
Or try all sorts of different trivia categories. Or maybe you like
crosswords. Heck, even if you are a streetwise dice dude (or
dudette), there's a place for you at I win.
The prizes are nice looking, too. I probably won't win any of
them, but it was nice to enter in drawings for a home theater, a
new computer, and twenty thousand dollars. And there might
always be a chance to win — the drawings go from daily to
monthly, 112 know if anything I'm going to win that ten-dollar
certificate to somecrap.com, but something is better than noth
ing.
1 he key to iwin's success — and it has been successful — are
the games. Trying to win baubles is all right, but playing poker
for those chances to win is better. The incredible variety of
games almost makes this more of a game site than a play-to-win
site, but that's discussion best left for another week.
()ne last thing — 1 suggest having a spotter of sorts when you
get on Ixvin. A roommate, a neighbor, a parent even — some
body to come and make sure you haven't wasted away your
entire life in front of blackjack, (let a little help from your
friends.
