# Computer aids assist disabled students' studies

### EILEEN CHAO STAFF WRITER 
With features from voice recognition to Braille
translation, a cluster of new equipment on the second
floor of Meyer Library has been added to the list of ac
commodating facilities for disabled students on cam
pus.
The area, called the Assistive Computer Technolo
gy Center, offers various high-tech equipment to help
students with disabilities conduct research, browse
the Web or complete other schoolwork.
"The goal is to provide access to adaptive and as
sistive technology for students on campus with special
needs," said Academic Technology Manager Olivia
Williamson.
The center was set up by an academic technology
specialist, Darren Luvaas, who recently left Stanford
to establish an Internet startup. It took almost half a
year to complete.
"We started setting up the lab over the summer,"
Williamson said. "It became fully operational in De
cember."
Currently about 100 students are using one or
more of the assistive technologies available at the cen
ter, according to Williamson.
There is a voice recognition system which allows
students to dictate their essays or reports instead of
typing. Some voice recognition systems also allow stu
dents to control the computer operation itself.
The center also has equipment that is useful for

students with vision difficulties or learning disabilities
who may have trouble processing written documents.
"If students are unable to read on a normal Web
page, we have [programs] that can read the text off
the screen or magnify the screen," Williamson said.
"Also, you can scan in a text and the computer will
read it out loud."
Along with software, the center contains a variety
of hardware to accommodate students with disabili
ties. Keyboards are just one of the many devices in the
center that have been modified for special use.
"We have keyboards with larger keys, or ones with
keys spaced wider apart," Williamson said. "Some
keyboards can be separated [into two parts] or ad just
ed to be put iti different angles. Also, there are key
boards for blind or specially impaired where you can
feel which keys [are which letters]."
Some of the most popular technological features at
the center are the Braille translators, according to
Williamson. One machine can scan in a written text
and print out a Braille translation. Another machine
can translate the words straight from the screen.
"11 takes a line of text from the computer and trans
lates it," Williamson said. " The student can highlight
a line and the machine will punch up [the Braille
equivalent] so the student can read the screen line by
line."
Even with all of these options, Williamson said
there are still several technologies the center does not

have.
"We don't have everything in
the market." she said. "Hut we try
to have a broad range ol tec hnolo
gy to accommodate people with
disabilities."
Most of the computers in use at
the center are l'( Is, because much
of the funding lot the initiative
came from a grant from Intel
Corp.
"()ur current center was estab
lished through a grant from Intel
which provided us with the initial
computing equipment,"
Williamson said. "The [Disability
Resources Center) and Dean ol
Students offices provide the fund
ing for software and other ser
vices."
As much as Williamson would
like the general public to benefit
from this center, she added that
people need to go through the
DRC to be evaluated for their
disabilities in order to be autho
rized to use the center's ma
chines.
"We have these machines spe

cially for people with disabilities,"
she said. "We must make sure the
lab is reserved for these people
with special needs."
I he DRC also teaches students
how to use the high-tech equip
ment.
"We have a number of different
staff members who work with dif
ferent departments around the
University to assist faculty with in
tegrating technology into teach
ing and learning," Williamson
said.
According to Williamson, Stan
ford has always had these kinds of
machines to accommodate dis
abled students, but only had
"three or four." It was difficult for
students to use the machines
whenever they wanted to.
I he new c enter has made using
these kinds of machines much
more convenient lor the people
who need them the most.
" I lie grant allowed us to create
a central location so the students
can have access to it when they
need it." Williamson said. "It was
important the make the access [to
these machines] for the disabled
students as easy as access to the
regular computers for everyone
else."
