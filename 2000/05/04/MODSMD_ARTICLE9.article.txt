Tiger Woods snubs Nike
LOS ANCELES (AP) — Tiger Wcx>ds, the golf star and
highly paid Nike pitchman, has joined the strike by TV
and radio commercial actors by refusing to film an ad for
the sportswear manufacturer.
Wcxxls had been scheduled to shoot a Nike commer
cial Tuesday at Islesworth Country Club, the golfer's
home course near Orlando, Fla. But he decided to just
not do it.
"There is a strike going on and we're abiding by it,"
said his agent, Mark Steinberg of International Manage
ment Croup. No commercial was filmed Tuesday and
none would be for several weeks, he said.
Wtxxls' decision was greeted enthusiastically by the
Screen Actors Cuild, which authorized the strike along
with the American Federation of Television and Radio
Artists. About 135,000 actors are represented by the
unions.
The strike, which began Monday, escalated with the
filing Tuesday of a federal unfair labor practice charge
against the actors' union for allegedly threatening to per
manently ban actors from the union if they appear in
commercials during the strike.
Brown suspends publisher
of San Francisco Examiner
SAN FRANCISCO (AF) — The Hearst Corp. swiftly
suspended the publisher of the San Francisco Fxaminer
after he testified in open court that he offered Mayor
Willie Brown favorable editorials in exchange for his sup
port of the company's deal to buy the San Francisco
Chronicle.
Timothy White, editor and publisher of the Hearst
owned Examiner, was taking an "indefinite leave of ab
sence," it was announced late Tuesday.
White testified Monday in the federal antitrust trial
challenging Hearst's $660 million purchase of the rival
Chronicle. In statements Tuesday, Hearst contended
that the conversation White described on the witness
stand never happened, or, if it did happen, violated com
pany policy.
Examiner Executive Editor Phil Bronstein, who said
he was present at the lunch meeting when Brown talked
with White, maintains there was "no discussion whatso
ever about any favorable coverage."
"A wide variety of subjects were discussed but nothing
seemed inappropriate," Kandace Bender, Brown's
spokeswoman said Wednesday. " The mayor has led the
charge to keep the Examiner alive. He wants a two-news
paper town."

Pomona protests for unions
CIAREMONT, Calif. (AF) — Students at Pomona
College have reached an agreement with university offi
cials and ended a two-day protest in support of cafeteria
workers' right to unionize, Pomona College President
Peter W. Stanley said.
Atone point during the protest a dozen student mem
bers of the Worker Support Committee chained them
selves to ail administration building and shut it down —
only the second time in a decade students have taken
such action, Stanley said Tuesday night.
There were no injuries, arrests or academic suspen
sions.
Students were trying to get the college to pressure Ara
mark Corp., the college's fcxxl-server contractor, to allow
its approximately 300 workers at the five-campus Clare
mont Colleges to declare whether they want to unionize.
Under Aramark's contract with the Pomona, workers
must declare support for unionization through sec ret bal
loting, but organizers who are try ing lo unionize workers
are pushing for a more open method, Stanley said.
There were also demonstrations over the weekend at
nearby Pitzer College.
