rock and hard drives, the band Metallica has delivered
the screen names of 335,000 users it accuses of music
piracy to the online company it says aided the theft.
Drummer Lai s Ulrich helped wheel in 60,000 pages of
documents Wednesday lie said proves the band's music
has been traded illegally using Napster Inc. software.
Ulrich suggested the music traders were cowards,
using high technology for low-down theft even as some
fans broke their Metallica CDs and others waved anti
recording industry banners outside Napster headquar
ters.
"II they want to steal Metallica's music, instead of hid
ing behind their computers in their bedrooms and dorm
rooms, then just go down to lower Records and grab
them off the shelves," Ulrich said.
Because Napster officials say the service does not di
rectly provide the copyrighted music — only the means
to get it — the company claims its service is legal.
Metallica is suing Napster in federal court to block
users of its file-sharing software from accessing the band's
music via the company's computer servers in San Mateo.
Ihe band accused Napster of copyright infringement
and racketeering.
