1920
On this date, the University de
clared "University Labor Day," on
which students cleaned out a campus
building to create a clinic for chil
dren.
"All students of the University,
men and women, will don overalls
and ginghams on the designated
date, and march at right shoulder
hoes and rakes in infantry style to the
scene of action."
The event coordinator ensured
that, "something novel and tasty in
the way of dainties would be provid
ed, but that no refreshments refresh
ments would be served until after the
work is completed."
The Bottom Line: In comparison, hash
ing sounds positively dull.
