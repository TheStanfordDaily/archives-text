I lunclreds of federal agents swept

theii vearlong occupation of the
bomb-strewn range.
I he Naw wasted no time in
announcing new bombing exer
cises on Puerto Rico's Vieques
Island, which had been put on
hold !>\ the protests.
Pentagon officials said the
Navy planned to resume training
within two weeks using dunitnv
bombs, according to an agree
ment reached between President
Clinton and Puerto Rican (iov.
Pedro Rossello in |anuarv.
Vieques residents, meanwhile,
will vote on whether the Naw
should leave the island in 20011. A
date for the referendum h;is not
been set.
I he resumption <>I training is a
prerequisite for the transfet of
$40 million in economic aid lor
Vieques called for b\ the |anuar\
agreement.
Backed b\ helicopters and
ships, 200 Mil agents and 100
I .S. Marshals swept ac ross Puerto
Rico's Vieques Island at dawn,
detaining the ac ti \ ists. several law

In Washington. Attornex (»en
eral Janet Reno said all 12 protest
sites were cleared and that there
would be no charges against the
demons!raters unless they assault
ed federal officers or returned to
range.
"All indications are that the
protesters have handled them
selves in a peaceful and dignified
manner,' Reno said.
Some protesters tried to run
awa\ when agents arrived, but
"that was a short-lived exercise,

to Roosevelt Roads Naval Station,
which administers the nearby
Vieques range.
H\ late afternoon, about 100
bad been released and more were

being freed periodically.
Marlin said no agents were
injured in the raid and it was
believed all protesters were offtbe
range.
"( ompati iots. compatriots! We
are winning and Vieques is going

to l>e free of the Navy," veteran
Independence Party leader
Ruben Berrios — who had not left
the range fora year — told cheer
ing supporters after his release.
Yesterday evening, hundreds
of residents waving Puerto Rican
flags gave a heroes' welcome to
do/ens of the detained who
returned by boat to Isabel 11,
Vieques' biggest town.
"You can bet that we're going
back," said protester Rega Miro,
26. "Because of what we've done,
every day the movement will grow
stronger."
Miro said the protesters were
treated well and that the Navy tried
to get them to sign papers promis
ing they would not return to the
bombing range. They refused, he
said.
Demonstrators invaded the live
fire range — used by the Navy and
U.S. allies to train for every major
conflict since World War 11 — after
two stray bombs killed civilian sec u
rity guard David Sanes Rodriguez,
35, on April 19, 1999. The Navy
said Sanes was the first fatality in 60
years of exercises on Vieques and
that the range is vital to national
security.
Opponents charge Navy exer
cises have damaged their health,
coral reefs, fishing grounds and
endangered species and have
stunted development on the
Vieques, where the Navy employs
only 100 local people and unem
ployment is 18 percent, compared
to Puerto Rico's average of 12 per
cent.
Rossello, who also wants the
Navy to leave, said he was "happy"
with the outcome.
Mindful of the Elian Gonzalez
raid in Miami and its aftermath,
both sides in Vieques expressed
relief at the lack of violence in yes
terday's operation.
But protests erupted in the
main island of Puerto Rico as the
Navy announced its plans to
resume Vieques training.
