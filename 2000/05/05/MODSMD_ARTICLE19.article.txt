						Stanford Daily Stanford should address concerns of local janitors

Published Since IS')!

Tlu- J us!it lor Janitors < ampaign,
launched by (Ik* Service Lmployees
International I nion Local 1N77, has
scived .is a lightening rod l< >i issues ol
economic well-being and six lal justice across the
country. In the past lew months, janitors in Los
\ngeles, \ew Yoi k, (lliicagoand S;in I )iego have
lought Ibi wage iiu leases, olien on the order ol
SI per hour.
With I lie New York limes and the Los Ange
les media printing Iron I-page stories ol the eco
nomic hardship ol working lamilies whose pri
mary eai net receives S7 01 SH an hour, the jani
tors' t ampaign has evoked cinpathx and support
from religious leaders, policy-makers, and politi
cians. Republicans and Democrats alike.
I lere at Stanlord, about <S0 janitors are ineiii
bers ol LS77, and then conlrac t expires May I.

Most earn around $8.04 per hour, and average
household income based on this wage is almost
10 percent short of a "bask family budget." At a
rail) last Thursday, hundreds ol Bay .Area jani
tors and <<>mmuilily leaders rallied in Mountain
View to create momentum lor their contract
c ampaign and to make their case to the public.
I lie I 'niversit.y has a right and a duly as an
indirect employer to make c lear that il will not
support sub-poverty wages. Although no one is
asking Stanford to negotiate formally with either
party, it is indisputable that Stanford sits at the
top ol die hiring structure and can set standards
for contrac ting firms such as American building
Maintenance.
li) expect Stanlord to take a stand on the jan
itors' campaign is completely sensible and not
without precedent. Los Angeles building owners

and local companies such .is Paramount Studios
— as indirect employers — called on coot meting
linns in writing to grant the Los Angeles janitors
their demand for fail wages. Stanlord should
lake responsibilit\ lor its workers and public In
support their cllorts t<> rise exit ol poverty
At an institution that encourages si i ic lei its to
complicate their thought and increase the
nuance ol their we should ;ill rec
ognize that the iilility-inaxiini/ation brought
alxmt In ihe market under certain tone lit ions is
only one consideration. While cfliciency has an
important role in the economy, need is also
important.
Workers on this campus have families, and
their families have the need for adequate living
space, nourishment .nic I other b;isi( freedoms,
sin h as the freedom from want. Lcouoniisi and

N'olx'l Laureate Amartya Sen has noted how
Adam Smilh himself emphasized the importance
of hasic capabilities such as participating in the life
<>l ilit- comniunitv and appealing in public with
out shame. When janitors march with signs pro
claiming "No More Second-hand Clothes", and
"Healths diets for out kids," as they did last
1 hnrscla) in Mountain View, they are lighting
lor basic capabilities. I liglier wages are the most
direct means to realizing these freedoms.
For these reasons, it would lx' unacceptable
lor Stanford to shirk responsibility and dismiss
the janitors' demands as bcvond Stan lord's con
trol. Stanford < I looses to accept contracts paying
workers a particular wage. If Stanford raises its
standards and demands living wages lor its work
ers, none ol the I Diversity's workers need live in
p< >vcrty.
