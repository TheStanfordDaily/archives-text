# Inadequate funds doom Asian scholars program
## 
### JULIANA LIU STAFF WRITER 
After three years of existence, the Asia/
Pacific Scholars Program will Ik- suspended
next year clue to inadequate funds, Institute
for International Studies Director David
Holloway wrote in an e-mail to program
participants.
University President Gerhard Casper
made the decision to discontinue the pro
gram, according to its associate director,
Maria I oyoda. The program funds Asian
and American students to participate in

year-long seminars and pursue graduate
studies at Stanford.
"It seemed that President Casper was dis
appointed on two fronts, the financial and
that the program hasn't met his expecta
tions," said Asia / Pacific scholar Jean Tang,
a medical student and doctoral candidate .
The Assistant to the President Jacqueline
Wender said Casper is traveling and un
available for comment.
"Casper's original goal was to fund about
20 scholars for two years," said Mara War
wick, a c ivil and environmental engineering
doctoral candidate. "Initially, they were

only able to raise enough money to fund live
scholars from China and one from Hong
Kong."
Warwick said that in the past three years,
the other scholars have received $5,000
stipends, not full fellowships. I he hulk of
programming costs and stipends have been
covered by the President's ()llice.
Steve Suda, director of the Ollice ol De
velopment, said the program is still $30
million short of the $50 million fund-rais
ing goal set at the program's initiation in
1997.
Some students who have participated

in the program believe the decision is pre
mature.
"The suspension is very tragic," said
Medical and (Graduate School of Business
student Chris Sheti. "My view is that it is a
vcr\ promising program, and it hasn't real
l\ had ;i chance to reat li its full potential."
l he program began in 1997 with an in
augural (lass of 19 graduate students from
dillerent Asian countries studying a variet)
of disciplines. A major goal of the program
is to train future leaders from the Asia-Pacif
ic region.
In the program's second year, 22 schol

ars, including students from the United
Slates, joined the program.
"The Asia-Pacific region needs visionary
young leaders who can approach the area's
emerging issues with a broad international
perspective, and with a propensity tor re
gional cooperation that mirrors the emerg
ing regional consciousness," the program's
Web site says.
Mam past and present scholars think
funding should he less of an issue in the de
cision to suspend the program.
"If you ask am of these scholars,
money isn't the underlying issue
why they joined the program in the
first plate," Shen said. "It was really
about the community, the program
and the < un it ulum."
Warwick agreed. She said, " I he
program iisrll is the building ol
conununit) among scholars. We
think that you can do that without
funding all the scholars."
Wednesday evening, a group <>l
scholars presented their cause to
Holloway, Warwick said.

"We tried to show that we have
li.id an opportunitN to discuss and
understand main of the impor
tant issues of the Asia-Pacific re
gion and to develop leadership
skills. Warnick said.
I lie group wanted to begin dis
cussing alternative wavs for the pre >-
gram to continue.
"Our alternatives are based on
the fact that we don't agree with the
premise that ifyou can't fund every
body, then you shouldn't have a
program," Warwick said. "That
shouldn't be the benchmark."
Warwick said the group be
lieves it will be even more difficult
to raise funds when there is no ac
tive program.

(iroup members, including
Warwick, agreed that I lolloway was
supportive.

Warwic kand faylor l'ravel,a Ph.l)
c andidate in political science, hope
to nieel with President Casper and
incoming President John llen
ness) lo discuss the future of the
pre (grain.
While the group currently has
not ollerecl concrete solutions 10
funding problems, ideas range
Irom using interest from the fellow
ship 11 nsi to pay for administrative
costs to encouraging donors to be
more ac ti\r in supporting the pro
grain, ac cording to Warw ic k.
Students said they want the

program lo continue 111 Us current
capacity and are willing to work
with the administration to see thai
happen
"We want lo let him know ihe
value ol the program," fang s;iid.
"It's an interdisciplinary forum for
students from different back
grounds and cliflerent countries."
Randy Schriver, a Ph.l) candi
date in political science, said being
an Asia/Parific scholar is a lifetime
honor, lie is optimistic about the
pr<>gram's future.
"I think you have a group of siu
dcnls w ho are interested in doing .ill
tliey can lo gel the program going,
helping with the funclraisingand with
gelling out the publicity," he said.
