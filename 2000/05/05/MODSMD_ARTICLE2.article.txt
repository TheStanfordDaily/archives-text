# Inadequate funds doom Asian scholars program
## 
### JULIANA LIU STAFF WRITER 
After three years of existence, the Asia/
Pacific Scholars Program will Ik- suspended
next year clue to inadequate funds, Institute
for International Studies Director David
Holloway wrote in an e-mail to program
participants.
University President Gerhard Casper
made the decision to discontinue the pro
gram, according to its associate director,
Maria I oyoda. The program funds Asian
and American students to participate in

year-long seminars and pursue graduate
studies at Stanford.
"It seemed that President Casper was dis
appointed on two fronts, the financial and
that the program hasn't met his expecta
tions," said Asia / Pacific scholar Jean Tang,
a medical student and doctoral candidate .
The Assistant to the President Jacqueline
Wender said Casper is traveling and un
available for comment.
"Casper's original goal was to fund about
20 scholars for two years," said Mara War
wick, a c ivil and environmental engineering
doctoral candidate. "Initially, they were

only able to raise enough money to fund live
scholars from China and one from Hong
Kong."
Warwick said that in the past three years,
the other scholars have received $5,000
stipends, not full fellowships. I he hulk of
programming costs and stipends have been
covered by the President's ()llice.
Steve Suda, director of the Ollice ol De
velopment, said the program is still $30
million short of the $50 million fund-rais
ing goal set at the program's initiation in
1997.
Some students who have participated

in the program believe the decision is pre
mature.
"The suspension is very tragic," said
Medical and (Graduate School of Business
student Chris Sheti. "My view is that it is a
vcr\ promising program, and it hasn't real
l\ had ;i chance to reat li its full potential."
l he program began in 1997 with an in
augural (lass of 19 graduate students from
dillerent Asian countries studying a variet)
of disciplines. A major goal of the program
is to train future leaders from the Asia-Pacif
ic region.
In the program's second year, 22 schol

ars, including students from the United
Slates, joined the program.
"The Asia-Pacific region needs visionary
young leaders who can approach the area's
emerging issues with a broad international
perspective, and with a propensity tor re
gional cooperation that mirrors the emerg
ing regional consciousness," the program's
Web site says.
Mam past and present scholars think
funding should he less of an issue in the de
cision to suspend the program.
