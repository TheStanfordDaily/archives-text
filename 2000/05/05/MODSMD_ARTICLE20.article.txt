xct, Itcif I was on a
hammock, a month hum graduation.
11 tings beg an lo spin. I lie sk\ slat ted to
move and take on a dillerctil shade ol 1)1 tic
and t lie I ices started to shake and shudder.
I hen just as I realized what was going on.
the hainiiKN k finished its spin and
dumped me on the ground.
I lie wot Id steadied hul iililoi Innately,
tin It caking out didut So I conliontcd mx
feelings in the most "Stanford" wax th.it I
knew how. I xxent running.
I tout the si.n i. this i mi lelt dillerent,
like it xvas imporiant in some wax. I started
in the traditional manner, running to the
hase ol the I )ish loop, dc( iding that il was
too miK h uphill, and piomptlx turning
around Hul helore heading hat k to the
new and improved ( ainptis Drixe run, I
stopped to lake a hreak (I suggest taking
breaks exet x lix e minutes xvlicn xou run. 11
doubles the Inn i >1 xoui i tin)
I stood |here leaning against the < liain
link lence. pist staling up at the Dish. I
let in inhered the In si time I w cnl up lo the
Dish. 1 was i junioi in high school and I
thought I was.i gteai (toss-(ounin run
nel. I he Dish (|tii( klx proved me wtong. I
reniemhered tin I it si nine I actuallx went
the extra hall mile past I he Dish lo the
highest point, the point with the rock lor
malion that's (onstantlx (hanging, the
point wlietc xou (,m see .ihsolutelx cxeix
thing. I icnictnheted ti x itig to write out nix
entire name (spelled "Ahhijit lihat
ta( harxa ) xxilli the t<h ks and harclx inak
111g it to the second t I remembered the
(.impitig trips with nix Resident Assistant,
the i nits and bike tides through cow tcrri
torx. ,md the tnanx important (onxersa
tions with li iends about lile and loxv, topics
that seemed to con if up cllortlcsslx when
nicandeiing through the Foothills. I stood
there and tcalized thai there would be a

siguilit ant pai I ol my Stanford career miss
ing without the Dish. I started to feel con
net ted and refreshed, the graduation anx
iel\ heeomiug an annoving murmur in the
hack ol m\ mind. I started 1 tinning again.
I decitlcd to change my route. Instead
ol ( anipus Drive, I ran straight into cam
pus. I ran to the Main Quad. I'm .1 let hie.
I haven't had a rlass hi the Main Quad in
what leels like ages. It was approat hing
dusk anil the Quad was 111 one of its. "Look
I .1111 so beautiful" moods. As the Quad
Haunted herself, I thought back to lull
Moon on the Quad where I had a lot of fun
.. . ilium ... dancing anil ... ulili .. . talk
ing to people. I here was also getting in in\
first bike actideni with a I .aim American
Studies fat 11 It\ member, getting caught on
the roof while plaving t apt lire the llag, and
then of course, the priceless late night walks
in Ik>ii 1 ol the t hurt h. I lie anxious mm -
111111 latled. I continued to jog pcatcliilK
<li>wit meiuoiA lane.
I visited the (.ales ol I fell with its 1111*111-
ories ol wine, cheese, poetr\ anil pathetic
attempts at being intellectual. I ran In
Maples Pavilion and the plate where I
pit ked up tlie Iree liilon with the odd white
slain on it aliei the tragical!) slioit Sixth
Man sleepout last year. I paused In Lake
Lag to leineinbei m\ da\s as a lileguard
and having to save a drunken man who
had managed to sink an entire rati 011 his
own. I ran In what used 10 be the (.0 11<>,
I erman f'.ngincering and Roblc field,
eat Ii plate holding .1 separate set ol inenio
-1 its .mil einotioiis.
Reaching m\ room, I relict led bat k on
in\ run. W hat was its purpose? Was il to
show me all (lit* t« h>l Stanford landmarks to
improve in\ tout guiding? Was it to prove
it) nixsell that il I real!) wanted 10, I tould
walk Ironi Suites to the rest ol campus
instead ol timing? ()i ma\be it was jusi to
convince me 1 hat I should "Save the
htx>l hills." I'm not realK sure. II I hail to
guess. I would sa\ il was It) remind me It)
experience as much ol Stanford while I
have the ID card, because lime is running
short.
So loi all the seniors in the audience, go
back and rcmcmhei those "special" plates
Ironi vour Stanford career. Maybe it's the
laundry room in Mirlo. Or maybe it's the
24-hour study room (though I sincereh
hope not). ()i iL \t>u"ri* extra lut k\. il might
be the Roblc Zoo Room.
Whatever it is. lake a trip. Remember
lhe good times, the bad limes and the limes
when you were 100 tired to tell.
Its time to stait taking slot k, ant I vou
shouldn't have to fall out ola hammock to
know that.
