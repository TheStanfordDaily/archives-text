Responding to new Foothills plan
We must rejoice that Stanford has final-
I) come to its senses and will Ir\ to stop the
destruction ol its foothill propertv. I hat
fragile undeveloped open spate, never a
park, has been trashed In grotesque
ovei use and is in desperate need of reha
bilitation. Although it would have been lai
bet lei anil ninth less expensive to dose
the area entirely, Stanford will continue to
be a good neighbor. Its lands will remain
open to all. at no cost, under a lew rea
sonable rules: sia\ on the loin miles ol
roads, go home at night, and lake voui
dogs elsewhere. I hose perpetual com
plaineis who can not tolerate these mod
est limitations are welcome to go else
where. Just try I'alo Alio foothill I'ark.

Well, Stanford has done il again with
au idioiit plan to restrict publit use of the
Dish area in the foothills ("Plan loi Dish
area announced", Ma\ ,'5).
I lie ban on tlogs, the designation ol
the l-'oothills as a wildlife habitat conser
vation area and proposed restoration ol
the area from ecological damage i 11 flit led
In unlimited publit use is welcome news.
But adding a new I'Diversity commit

ment and expense to managing trails and
roads indelinileb for publit recreation
makes no sense lor .1 universitv.
President (ierhard (laspei leels that
limitations 011 the use ol the Dish area are
nccessaiA. I agree. Kill when he stales
that the foothills are not a publit park
and in the same breath reinlorccs a I ni
versity toinrniiment to kiep the area
open it) "Ii ii-ii<ls and neighbors" amounts
it) a fin mal recognition ol the 112 oothills as
a publit park. Inviting more people (one
clav I saw some lolks from San I rani isco
having a pit nit in the Rvan ctttalyplus
grove) will increase congestion anil the
t osis of maintenance.
II ( aspei is sei ions about wanting to
keep the foothills at ccssible It) the public,
win not lake the next logical step? lUlild
adequate parking loi hikers to soke the
street congestion and parking problems.
I don't advocate that this be done, how
ever. I believe Sianlortl must restrict the
foothills to individuals associated with
the I niveisitx. A precedent lor this lias
been set In foothill Park. It's fbi Palo
Allans 011K and requires an idetilitv card
to get in. II the new polit \ is implement
ed as written, Stanford should at least
II large hikers a lee rather then squander
ing its endowment tor a non-acatleiTiit
pui pose. 1 am .1 campus hoineow ner and
die I diversity charges me ground rent
for the use of its land. It is onlv fair that
Dish area users bear the costs of mainte

iiiilui' and use of lilt* land.

Stanford needs to become more environ
mentally aware
As an ecologist and one who believes
vci\ strong!) in "thinking globally and
at ling locally." I should applaud Stan
ford's decision to close the Dish to the
broad range of recreational activities it
