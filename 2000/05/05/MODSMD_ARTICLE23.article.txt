Business school students have orga
nized a conference addressing the Inter
net's influence on healthcare, the first of
its kind to be held at Stanford.
"Stanford Business School is not
known for its program in health care,"
said I lealth / Biotechnology (Hub co-pres
ident Aradhana Sarin, a second year MBA
student. "We felt there was not enough
exposure to people in the industry."
I he conference, held this Saturday,
will begin with a keynote address by Roy
Whitfield, co-founder of Incyte (lenomics
and (.SB ( lass of '79. Incvte provides

genomic information to IS of the top 20
pharmaceutical companies and also con
trols the largest patent portfolio in the
biotechnology industry.
"We've asked him to not go into details
about how genomics will make money,"
said co-president and second-year busi
ness student David Kim. "We want him to
talk about how genomics will change the
face of health care."
following Whitfield's address, confer
ence participants can attend three sepa
rate panels, each featuring leaders of
high-tech companies and representatives
from medical fields.
I he biotechnology panel will focus on

the commercial potential of genomics. A
medical devices panel will discuss new
technology trends and approaches to
their funding. An "e-health panel" will
examine the Internet's effect on health
care.
"We want to be as broad as possible.
These three topics basically cover all of
healthcare at this point and time in the
industry," Sarin said.
A venture capitalist workshop,
designed to prepare participants for
negotiations with future investors, will be
led by a lawyer and an entrepreneur.
"We got the feedback that most of the
club members wanted to start their own

companies, but didn't know where to
start," Sarin said.
According to the event's marketing
director Lan Nguyen, a first-year business
student, approximately 200 to 250 people
are anticipated to attend the conference.
About half of these will be Stanford grad
uate students. The other attendees will be
faculty and industry insiders.
Whether this conference will be repeat
ed next year depends 011 the success of
this year's attempt.
"We would like to make it an annual
event," said Nguyen. "So far, the likeli
hood is high that we will hold something
like this in the future."
