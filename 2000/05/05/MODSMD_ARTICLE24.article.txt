Kenneth (iuthbertson, I niversity vice
president (lining the '(>() sand '70s and
Stanford graduate, died last Sunday <>l
Parkinson's disease at SI.
During his 17 years as yice president,
he organized the two largest fund-raising
campaigns in American higher education
and brought Stanford into second place,
behind Harvard, in total gift support.
In M)f)7, he wrote, "Servants like me
and the janitor can get our kicks out of
providing the means and services which
allow faculty and students to learn and

teach undo optimal circumstances."
He is known for contributing part of
his salary to Stanford's campaigns.
"hi a time of great change in the Uni
versity, lie was able to make everyone feel
they were still part of the Stanford family.
And that was a real challenge," said for
mer University President Donald
Kennedy, "He won and retained the
respect of this faculty, and was very well
regarded."
Klected student body president in his
senior year at Stanford, Cuthbertson
graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1940 and
married his student body vice president,
CiOline Upshaw, in 1941.
After one year at Harvard Business
School, Cuthbertson joined the Navy to
fight in World War 11. Cuthbertson's
right leg became paralyzed after he con
tracted a case of polio during his naval

service. In 1947, he returned to Stanford
to finish his MBA.
Cuthbertson became the assistant to
then University President J.K. Wallace
Sterling in 1954, before being appointed
vice president in 1960.
Cuthbertson's fund-raising efforts
started during a period of financial diffi
culty. When it became clear in 1960 that
the University budget needed to be cut,
Cuthbertson discussed where to make the
cuts with students and faculty members,
but lie also conducted the first national
survey of long-term fiscal planning in
higher education. Between 1961 and
1964, he organized a record-setting $114
million fund-raising campaign. Between
1972 and 1977 he set another national
record by raising $300 million more for
Stanford.
Under the stewardship of President

Wallace Sterling and Provost Frederick
Terman, Guthbertson helped a university
that had recently faced budget cuts grow
and expand.
"Many people refer to that remarkable
period of growth at Stanford as the Ster
ling-Terman era, but 1 think of it as the
Sterling-Terman-Cuthbertson era,"
Kennedy said. "Ken really was the
founder of modern academic develop
ment strategy."
In 1981, Kennedy announced the cre
ation of the Kenneth Cuthbertson Award,
given annually to a member of the com
munity "for exceptional service to Stan
ford University."
Cuthbertson is survived by his wife
Coline, his daughters Janet Whitchurch
and Nancy Cuthbertson, his sons Tom
and Jim, eleven granchildren and one
great-grandchild.
