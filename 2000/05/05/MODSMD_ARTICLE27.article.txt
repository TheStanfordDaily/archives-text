### SCOTT DORFMAN STAFF WRITER 
I xisi month's ruling by the I'nit
ecl States Court of Appeals that
found Microsoft guiltv of anticom
petitive business practices likely w ill
have <m big impact on Stanford, a
uni\ei'sity in the heart of Silicon
\ alley, lint many may not realize
that a Stanford faculty member mav
have had a big impact on the court's
decision.
Kconomics Prof. Roger Noll,
along with colleagues William 1).
Nordhaus, Frederic Sherer and
Robert K. Litan, submitted amici
curiae briefs to the trial judge,
which accused Microsoft of "mo
nopolistic abuses in the new econo
my-' and made several recommen
dations to the court on how Mi
crosoft should be punished for its
anticompetitive practices.
Noll's brief continually asserted
the-abuse* Iry- Microsoft to competi
tion in the marketplace.
"The central processing of our
new economy has a major flaw." the
brief said. "The company that pro
duces the dominant operating sys
tem for the personal computer lias
been found guilty of serious eco
nomic offenses: It has maintained
its monopoly in personal computer
operating systems by illegal anti
competitive means and has at
tempted to monopolize adjacent
markets."
As a solution, Noll and I lis col
leagues recommended to the court
that Microsoft be split into four sep
arate companies, with one in charge
of all non-operating s\stem applica
tions and the other three compet
ing in the marketing of the Win
dow s < >peraiing svstem.
"We chose three as the nuinbei
of competing Windows companies
because that was the minimum

number needed to c reate competi
tion," Noll said. "With two, there is
a danger of creating a duopolv that
is as harmful as a monopoh . The
market share of each Windows
companv, about 30 percent, is small
enough tobe in range of other small
competitors, such as Linux. \ four
firm industry provides a significant
level of competition."
Not eveiyone agrees with Noll's
solution to the Microsoft case, how
ever. Noll's colleague in the Kco
nomics Department, Prof. Robert
I lall. believes a four-way split ol Mi
crosoft "would be a more serious
punishment than is merited." He
also said that am split of Microsoft
could make bad business sense
"I think that the split up needs to
researched carefully," Hall said.
"First, the court needs to consider
that Microsoft will be punished in
private court c ases w here computer
purchasers and injured rivals are
likrtv TO receive "Targe ctanTagcjs
awards. To the extent that the
breakup is punishment, it should lie
coordinated with punishments ad
ministered in other courts.
"Second, the court needs to con
sider the harm to the consumer that
might flow from a breakup. If the
quality of Microsoft software de
clines because there is less coordina
tion between the OS developers
and the apps developers, that needs
to be weighed against an\ benefits."
I fill said.
Microsofi's punishment has vet
to be determined b\ I S. Court of
Appeals Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson. Regardless of the dec ision.
Noll said the future of Microsoft is
still vei \ much up in the aii.
"Ii is really a huge lotterv right
now because we have to see il Mi
crosoft wins on appeal. Noll said.
"There is, in m\ opinion, about a 20
or 30 percent c bailee that ihe\ u ill.
