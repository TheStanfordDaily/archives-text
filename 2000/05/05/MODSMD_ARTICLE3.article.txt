## The 						School of Earth Sciences announces a new Oceans Track. 
### TOMOKO SAKAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Starting next fall, Earth Systems majors will get a
chance to examine the 70 percent of the planet they
usually don't focus on: the ocean.
The School of Earth Sciences is introducing a new
major called the Oceans Track in its Earth Systems
Programs.
"We're ready to start a very exciting curriculum,
and there is a lot of enthusiasm from both faculty and
students. I anticipate a wonderful start next year," said
Pam Matson, director of the Earth Systems Program.
Three students have already declared the Oceans
Track major, and program coordinators anticipate 15
to 20 students will enroll next year.
The implementation of the new Oceans Track was
made possible primarily by the hiring of three new
professors: Robert Dunbar, Kevin Arrigo and Adina
Paytan; all three are oceanography specialists. Several
professors will be brought to campus from Hopkins
Marine Station to supplement the new program's fac
ulty. Hopkins is a Stanford campus in Monterey Bay
that focuses on marine biology.
"Hiring three new and brilliant professors was a big
initiative fora small school like us. I think the School of
Earth Sciences made a big commitment to the Oceans
Track," said Julie Kennedy, senior lecturer in Earth
Systems.
"Student input was a decisive factor in introducing
a new track too. Earth Systems students were very in
terested in comprehensive oceanography, which was
taught mostly at Hopkins. The Oceans Track brings
the adequate expertise onto campus, in which students
can learn not only the introductory concepts of

oceanography, but a much more
in-depth knowledge about the
o( can," Kennedy said.
I he program will depend on
dose collaboration with Hopkins
.iikl other institutions to provide a
wide range of classes fbi students.
"Basically, we want it to be very
iuterac live. For example, we have
integrated stud) programs in col
laboration with the Monterey Bay
A(|ii. ilium Research Institute for
contemporary data and research
findings. For the students who
enroll in this track, we seek to pro
vide good potential for future re
search and a solid grounding fora
I'll. 1) in a related area," Kennedy
said.
lu addition, the faculty of the
new ()< cans I rack hopes to intro
duce unconventional teaching

methods to serve a variety of stu
dents under different circum
stances.
"We are looking at distance
learning opportunities — classes
directly from Hopkins — and
field courses, in which students
will work hands-on in the coastal
system of the May Area," Matson
said.
I he track also uses input from
other disciplines.
"We have been working in
close collaboration with the Civil
and Knvironmental Engineering
Department too. With such inte
grated courses brought onto cam
pus, student athletes and those
with housing problems can now
study oceanography beyond the
introductory level without going
to I lopkins," Kennedy said.
Both Matson and Kennedy
agree that reactions from the fac
ulty and students have been ex
tremely positive.

"I'm preparing to teach sever
al classes next year, and I'm also
very excited about it," Paytan
said.
"I'd say the goal is to introduce
the diverse and interdisciplinary
field of oceanography to as many
students expressing interest.
Oceans have an immense impact
011 the climate, and are affected in
large l>y various human activities.
It is very important to learn the
role and impact the ocean has as
part of the Karth Systems Pro
gram," she said.
Paytan is planning to teach
"Introduction lo Paleo-()(xenog
raphy" as an elective, and "Ma
rine Chemistry" as a core class
starting next fall.
Sophomore Lindley Zerbe,
one of the first to take upper-divi
sion classes in the track, also em
phasized the program's signifi
cance and lauded its objectives.
"Introducing Ocean Sciences

as an interdisciplinary field is
amazing. We've had classes and
programs that centered on land
and land-related effects to and
from our environment. Now,
we're starting to learn the pro
found effects the ocean has on the
planet.
"I'm interested in microbiolo
gy and the medicinal uses of the
ocean. As far as I'm concerned,
the ocean holds a great wealth of
potential resources: the next
Amazon," Lindley said.
I lowever, he does concede that
the new program is not yet fully
coordinated.
"I think we need to integrate
more biologic al oceanography on
campus. Also, a big task is to make
it more accessible to students, i.e.
make lower-division classes that
stir interest about the ocean in
general. It would be revolution
ary if we could bring on campus
fun and challenging classes that

we've never had before that
would breed general interest
among students," Lindley said.
Faculty in the track hope it will
make oceanography more acces
sible to undergraduates and are
focusing on public izing I he* pro
gram to make sure students are
aware of it.
"We hope that more students
will gel exposure to a wealth of
know ledge and first-hand experi
ence that we are offering. In an)
case, it will provide exciting op
portunities," said 1111ic Kennedy.
"For example, Lauren Rogers, a
sophomore majoring in the
Oceans Crack, is currently on a
trip to Antarctica with professor
Robert Dunbar."

oceanography, but a much more
in-depth knowledge about the
o( can," Kennedy said.
I he program will depend on
dose collaboration with Hopkins
.iikl other institutions to provide a
wide range of classes fbi students.
"Basically, we want it to be very
iuterac live. For example, we have
integrated stud) programs in col
laboration with the Monterey Bay
A(|ii. ilium Research Institute for
contemporary data and research
findings. For the students who
enroll in this track, we seek to pro
vide good potential for future re
search and a solid grounding fora
I'll. 1) in a related area," Kennedy
said.
lu addition, the faculty of the
new ()< cans I rack hopes to intro
duce unconventional teaching

methods to serve a variety of stu
dents under different circum
stances.
"We are looking at distance
learning opportunities — classes
directly from Hopkins — and
field courses, in which students
will work hands-on in the coastal
system of the May Area," Matson
said.
I he track also uses input from
other disciplines.
"We have been working in
close collaboration with the Civil
and Knvironmental Engineering
Department too. With such inte
grated courses brought onto cam
pus, student athletes and those
with housing problems can now
study oceanography beyond the
introductory level without going
to I lopkins," Kennedy said.
Both Matson and Kennedy
agree that reactions from the fac
ulty and students have been ex
tremely positive.

"I'm preparing to teach sever
al classes next year, and I'm also
very excited about it," Paytan
said.
"I'd say the goal is to introduce
the diverse and interdisciplinary
field of oceanography to as many
students expressing interest.
Oceans have an immense impact
011 the climate, and are affected in
large l>y various human activities.
It is very important to learn the
role and impact the ocean has as
part of the Karth Systems Pro
gram," she said.
Paytan is planning to teach
"Introduction lo Paleo-()(xenog
raphy" as an elective, and "Ma
rine Chemistry" as a core class
starting next fall.
Sophomore Lindley Zerbe,
one of the first to take upper-divi
sion classes in the track, also em
phasized the program's signifi
cance and lauded its objectives.
"Introducing Ocean Sciences

as an interdisciplinary field is
amazing. We've had classes and
programs that centered on land
and land-related effects to and
from our environment. Now,
we're starting to learn the pro
found effects the ocean has on the
planet.
"I'm interested in microbiolo
gy and the medicinal uses of the
ocean. As far as I'm concerned,
the ocean holds a great wealth of
potential resources: the next
Amazon," Lindley said.
I lowever, he does concede that
the new program is not yet fully
coordinated.
"I think we need to integrate
more biologic al oceanography on
campus. Also, a big task is to make
it more accessible to students, i.e.
make lower-division classes that
stir interest about the ocean in
general. It would be revolution
ary if we could bring on campus
fun and challenging classes that

we've never had before that
would breed general interest
among students," Lindley said.
Faculty in the track hope it will
make oceanography more acces
sible to undergraduates and are
focusing on public izing I he* pro
gram to make sure students are
aware of it.
"We hope that more students
will gel exposure to a wealth of
know ledge and first-hand experi
ence that we are offering. In an)
case, it will provide exciting op
portunities," said 1111ic Kennedy.
"For example, Lauren Rogers, a
sophomore majoring in the
Oceans Crack, is currently on a
trip to Antarctica with professor
Robert Dunbar."
