## The
						School of Earth Sciences announces a new Oceans Track. 
### TOMOKO SAKAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Starting next fall, Earth Systems majors will get a
chance to examine the 70 percent of the planet they
usually don't focus on: the ocean.
The School of Earth Sciences is introducing a new
major called the Oceans Track in its Earth Systems
Programs.
"We're ready to start a very exciting curriculum,
and there is a lot of enthusiasm from both faculty and
students. I anticipate a wonderful start next year," said
Pam Matson, director of the Earth Systems Program.
Three students have already declared the Oceans
Track major, and program coordinators anticipate 15
to 20 students will enroll next year.
The implementation of the new Oceans Track was
made possible primarily by the hiring of three new
professors: Robert Dunbar, Kevin Arrigo and Adina
Paytan; all three are oceanography specialists. Several
professors will be brought to campus from Hopkins
Marine Station to supplement the new program's fac
ulty. Hopkins is a Stanford campus in Monterey Bay
that focuses on marine biology.
"Hiring three new and brilliant professors was a big
initiative fora small school like us. I think the School of
Earth Sciences made a big commitment to the Oceans
Track," said Julie Kennedy, senior lecturer in Earth
Systems.
"Student input was a decisive factor in introducing
a new track too. Earth Systems students were very in
terested in comprehensive oceanography, which was
taught mostly at Hopkins. The Oceans Track brings
the adequate expertise onto campus, in which students
can learn not only the introductory concepts of
