## Speeders on display Cardinal Invite will feature big names and fast times tonight 
### BEN ALLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
As is now tradition this time of
year, the focus of American track
and field now shifts to the Farm for
the next in a series of high-caliber
meets — today's Cardinal Invita
tional.
I lead coach Vin Lananna, who
has helped transform Stanford into
a distance runner's haven, once
again rolls out stellar men's and
women's fields in tonight's distance
carnival at Cobb Track.
"First and foremost, we want to
provide opportunities for Stanford
athletes to compete," Lananna
said. "But the bigger picture is to
create a situation where athletes
will be able to compete in the Unit
ed States at a site that is user-friend
ly and allows for top performances.
" That's not always easy in the
United States."
Stanford's additions to the start
lists are not exhaustive — all of
tonight's competitors are also slat
ed to compete with the remainder
of the team in tomorrow's Big Meet
at Cal.
Those who will compete tonight
will be aiming for NCAA, Olympic
Trials and even Olympic Games

qualifying marks.
The men's crew will send se
niors Brad and Brent Hauser and
redshirt sophomore Jonathon
Riley to the line in the 5,000-meter
run. Pace setters have been in
structed to lead the field through
the 3,000-meter mark in a blister
ing 8 minutes, ensuring a race that
will either make or break most of
the runners in the field.
