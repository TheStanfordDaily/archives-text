# Final Four marks lacrosse's last stand

### BROOKE MORRILL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Cardinal is approaching
this weekend's Final Four Western
Women's Lacrosse League cham
pionship from a new perspective
â€” as an underdog. The team trav
els to San Diego as the two-year re
turning champion, and it is pre
pared to fight hard to retain its
title.
I he four teams that will be pie
sent at the tournament are UC-
Davis (No. 1 from the North),
Stanford (No. 2 from the North),
UCLA (No. 1 from the South) and
Claremont Mckenna (No. 2 from
the South).
"We are all incredibly excited to
be playing in San Diego this week
end," said sophomore offender
Caroline Osterwise. "We're eager
to have the chance to reclaim some
of the missed opportunities that
we've been forced to confront this
season."
Stanford, with a division record
of 4-3, faces UCLA (8-1) in their
first game Saturday evening at
UCSD. Traditionally, the teams
from the northern bracket have
tended to be stronger than their
southern counterparts, as evi
denced by the northern victories
in recent years.
"In researching UCI.A, we've

found that they've had a very .suc
cessful season and seem to be
strengthening their program each
year," Osterwise said. "Since we
don't know many specifics about
the individual talent of their play
ers, it is important that we focus on
playing a solid GO minutes of our
own game and control the tempo
regardless of their style of play."
If the Cardinal is victorious
against the Bruins, it will battle in
the championship game on Sun
day against the winner of the Davis
/ Claremont game. If Stanford falls
to UCLA, the women will play for
third place against the loser of that
game.
With a commitment to building
its lacrosse program this year,
Stanford filled its schedule with
more high-caliber competition
than ever before. Despite a higher
number of losses than in previous
years, the team has gained a
tremendous amount of experi
ence.
Head coach I leidi Connor said,
"In retrospect, playing those
games made us a better team in
the end. In comparison to Davis or
Cal, our schedule has been
tougher all year, and I believe that
it is helping us peak at the right
time."
