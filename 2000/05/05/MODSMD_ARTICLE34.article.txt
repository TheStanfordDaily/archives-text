### EMILY DRESSEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's coming clown to the wire for the No. 1 1
Stanford Softball team (41-14, 5-10 Pacific 10
Conference) as it embarks on its last Pac-10
road trip of the season this weekend in Ore
gon.
The Cardinal will battle it out with No. 16
Oregon (33-22, 5-10) Friday afternoon and
then No. 12 ()regon State (36-14,6-8) on Sat
urday and Sunday.
The results of these three games will weigh
heavily in determining the teams' overall
rankings within the conference.
Currently, Oregon State remains one

game ahead of the Ducks and the Cardinal.
Oregon and Stanford, however, are dead
locked with identical conference records of 5-
10.
(Conference ranking is crucial in determin
ing post-season regional seedings.
Stanford met up with the same Oregon
squads last month at home, dropping two
games to Oregon and inching past the
Beavers, 3-2.
Since that time, the Stanford women have
been working exhaustively on improving
their offense and drawing confidence from
their weekday non-conference contests.
This past Tuesday against San Jose State,
the Cardinal belted out one of its best perfor
mances yet at the plate, racking up a total of 17
runs in the doubleheader.
But the pitchers that the team faces during
conference play are among the country's elite,
