# Baseball battles Beavers in critical conference series
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN STAFF WRITER 
When head coach Mark Marquess leads
the No. 3 Stanford baseball team into Cor
vallis, Ore. to battle Oregon State for the
first time in his 23 years at the Cardinal's
helm, he'll be much more concerned with a
different "first": first place in the Pacific 10
Conference.
The Cardinal (35-11. 13-5 Pac-10) enters
the three-game series with a tenuous half
game lead over UCLA and sits just one
game in front of No. 5 Arizona State, mark
ing the first time all season it has been in sole
possession of the league's top spot.
"This series is big, but it's always big in
conference season," Marquess said. "And
not just for us in first place, but everyone is
playing for something."
For the Beavers, that "something" is a
postseason berth â€” an unthinkable accom
plishment before the 2000 campaign
began. Oregon State (26-20, 7-H) was
picked by coaches to finish last in the Pac-10
in the preseason poll but currently stands in
a fifth-place conference tie with California.
"So far, we've managed to keep doing

what we have to," said Beavers head coach
Pat Casey, whose team posted a pair of
come-from-behind wins over Washington
last weekend to win its third-straight Pac-10
series. "Now we're down to three weeks to
play, and we've put ourselves in position to
really make this a special season."
Though the Beavers come into the series
having won ten of their last 14 games, Stan
ford enters the weekend on an even bigger
roll. The Cardinal has taken 14 of 16, in
cluding ten victories in its last 12 Pac-10
contests.
The inspired mid-season Stanford
charge has much to do with its bats, which
have improved the team batting average to
.305 after slumping below .260 in early
March. With eight of nine regular starters
nursing averages above .300, the Cardinal
has knocked out more than 15 hits per
game in its last six outings.
Production from the bottom of the Stan
ford order may be the single most impor
tant factor in the recent offensive burst, with
