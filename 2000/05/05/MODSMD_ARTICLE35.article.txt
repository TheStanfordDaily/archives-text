# Baseball battles Beavers in critical conference series
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN STAFF WRITER 
When head coach Mark Marquess leads
the No. 3 Stanford baseball team into Cor
vallis, Ore. to battle Oregon State for the
first time in his 23 years at the Cardinal's
helm, he'll be much more concerned with a
different "first": first place in the Pacific 10
Conference.
The Cardinal (35-11. 13-5 Pac-10) enters
the three-game series with a tenuous half
game lead over UCLA and sits just one
game in front of No. 5 Arizona State, mark
ing the first time all season it has been in sole
possession of the league's top spot.
"This series is big, but it's always big in
conference season," Marquess said. "And
not just for us in first place, but everyone is
playing for something."
For the Beavers, that "something" is a
postseason berth — an unthinkable accom
plishment before the 2000 campaign
began. Oregon State (26-20, 7-H) was
picked by coaches to finish last in the Pac-10
in the preseason poll but currently stands in
a fifth-place conference tie with California.
"So far, we've managed to keep doing

what we have to," said Beavers head coach
Pat Casey, whose team posted a pair of
come-from-behind wins over Washington
last weekend to win its third-straight Pac-10
series. "Now we're down to three weeks to
play, and we've put ourselves in position to
really make this a special season."
Though the Beavers come into the series
having won ten of their last 14 games, Stan
ford enters the weekend on an even bigger
roll. The Cardinal has taken 14 of 16, in
cluding ten victories in its last 12 Pac-10
contests.
The inspired mid-season Stanford
charge has much to do with its bats, which
have improved the team batting average to
.305 after slumping below .260 in early
March. With eight of nine regular starters
nursing averages above .300, the Cardinal
has knocked out more than 15 hits per
game in its last six outings.
Production from the bottom of the Stan
ford order may be the single most impor
tant factor in the recent offensive burst, with
sophomores Andy Topham and Arik Van-
Zandt emerging as reliable starters at left
field and designated hitter, re
spectively. The reliability of
Topham and VanZandt in the
lineup's bottom two spots has di
versified the Cardinal attack by
adding the ability to extend, as
well as begin, rallies that simply
died earlier in the season.
Of course, having a slugger
like junior Joe Borchard heat up
hasn't hurt Stanford either. Bor
chard leads the club in five differ
ent offensive categories in Pac-10
games, including ten home runs
and 22 RBIs. Overall, his 13
homers and 49 RBIs also place
him among the team leaders.
On the hill, the Cardinal will
see junior Jason Young take the
ball in the series opener tonight.
Young was far from perfect one
week ago in a start at Sunken Dia-

mond but managed to escape
with a no-decision in California's
11 -inning, 7-5 win.
Fellow junior Justin Wayne,
the Pac-10's second ten-game
winner this season, gets the call in
tomorrow's 1 p.m. matinee,
which will be nationally televised
on Fox Sports Net. Wayne had
been the No. 1 starter until last
weekend, before which he strug
gled in consecutive starts on the
mound.
"We're going to stay with that
[rotation], and then we have the
next weekend off to make an ad
justment if it's needed," Marquess
said. "Wayne thinks that [the
switch] helped him feel a little bit
stronger the day after he pitched
last weekend, so it accomplished
what we wanted it to."
In fact, the Cardinal rotation
may finally look the way it was
supposed to before the season
began. After Young and Wayne,
sophomore Brian Sager may fi

nally be ready to step back into
the weekend rotation after sitting
out five weeks with shoulder sore
ness.
Sager pitched on Monday
night, but coaches limited his
pitch count and were pleased with
his performance enough to con
sider moving him back into the
third starter's role as soon as Sun
day's series finale. Sager's return
would push freshman Tim Cun
ningham back into the bullpen,
out of which he has made half of
his 12 appearances.
"It would be great [to become a
regular starter again], but right
now it doesn't matter — starting
or relieving, whatever's giving us
a chance to win and to get back to
Omaha [site of the College World
Series]," Sager said.
While Omaha will have to wait
for Sager and the Cardinal for
over a month, Corvallis gets a
look at the third-ranked squad in
the nation beginning tonight.
