### EMILY DRESSEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's a breezy, sunny Saturday at the
Stanford Softball complex. The fans,
decked out in Cardinal red and baseball
caps, squirm on the edge of the bleac h
ers in tingling anticipation.
Bring on any old Softball scenario:
bottom of the seventh, bases loaded,
and two outs situation, or just make it a
mid-game lead-oil attempt to put a run
on the board for the (Cardinal.
Either way, when the announcer
comes on the loud speaker and pro
claims the name Jessica Mendo/.a with
his emphatic flair, there's the familiar
sigh of relief the lans have had all season
to perfect.
Number 21 is exactly the person I hey
want at the plate.
Call her Mendoza, the Machine, the
Extraordinaire, the player who seems
immune to any sort of failure at the
plate.
Her batting average hovers at .4f>7
and boasts the No. 2 slot in all of college
Softball. She has already surpassed the
six single-season records she broke her
freshman year and appears on seven of
the I(Cardinal career statistics lists as a
sophomore.
In addition, this standout is racking
up Pacific 10 Conference I'layer of the
Week awards as if they were regular
pats on the back.
She is the only player this season to
be honored with three such titles and
may be on track this week to snag a
fourth after batting .857 last Tuesdav
against San Jose State.
Though her stats allow her to act oth
erwise, Mendoza couldn't be more
modest or unassuming, never daring to
take credit fora win or c asting blame on
those whose records may fall a little shy
of perfect.
She's a team player through and
through, who c redits her parents with
all the success she's experienced during
her time here at Stanford.

"My inoin and dad love coming to
the games. Alier all, tliey are the ones
who got me here. They did all the hours
of driving back and forth in traffic to get
me to practice every day."
In fact, it was her dad who intro
duced her to the game of softball, per
haps biased bv his position coaching the
Moorpart] College baseball team in
Ventura ('ounty, where Menclo/a grew
"I'-
ll ovvever, it wasn't hard to sell his

daughter on the sport. She dove right in
when she was seven, playing as one of
the only girls on a local boys' little league
team.
"I was an extremely energetic kid
who just loved all kinds of spoils," said
Menclo/a. "I was the hyperactive
tomboy type who had scars all over her
knees from playing football on the as
phalt with the boys in the neighbor

hoc x I."
W hen Mendoza was 1 1, she found an
all-girls traveling club on which to play,
joining the roster of the (ioleta Waves 12-
and-under team.
B\ that time, she was hooked on the
fast-pileh-windmill, pin-trading, triple
header world of Softball. There was no
going back.
Although she bounced around from
position to position, Mendoza was primar
ily a short-stop for the various clubs she
played on even summer growing up.
IK the time sin- reached Camarillo
1 ligli School, the coaching stall had yet an
other plan for the multi-talented fresh
man, decided to mold hei into a catcher
for one of the top programs in the state.
"The story of niv life was playing posi
tions I had ilevel played belore," Mendoza
said. "I think the onh two I never tout heel
were lirst-ba.se and pitcher."
Without any prior experience at catch
er, she surpassed everyone's expectations
and went on to claim the Camarillo High
School Female Athlete of the Yeai Award
in both 1997 and 1998.
But perhaps even more impressive
would he the jump she made from a 14-
and-under tournament team to an 18-
anel-under squad when she was 13, in
search of a greater challenge.
Mendoza earned a spot on the nation
all\ feared and renowned Cordon's I'an
thers 18-and-under division team as a
high school junior and senior and basked
in the glory of winning an American Soft
ball Association (iold l)i\ ision Softball title
in '98.
I mm ihere, coaches around the coun
ir\ were drooling over Mendoza, anxious
to add ilie voting prodigy to their respec
tive programs.
"Ii came down to the fact that I just
could not tiirn clown Stanford," Mendoza
said. Bill besides the academics, I wanted
to be an active part of a program, help
build it, not just be another number on a
c hanipionsliip team."
And help build it she has. Mendoza
came in. shook I lungs up, and made Car
dinal history.
Fast season as a freshman, she was
named first-team All-Ainei ican and I'ac
-10 Newcomer of the Year .

As a sophomore, Mendoza has already
bulldozed Stanford single season records
in hits (85), doubles (18), home runs (11),
runs scored (53) and stolen bases (14),
leaving fans wondering if I his superstar
could possibly be for real.
"Jessica is a phenomenal talent," said
head coach John Rittman. "She generates
tremendous bat speed and approaches the
plate with a clear idea of what she wants to
do."
"Last year she was more of a streaky hit
ter, every once in a while going on these of
fensive terrors, while this year she is much
more consistent."
But No. 'J I seems never to be satisfied,
no matter how stellar her performance is.
"1 don't like to think in terms of break
ing records," said Mendoza. "Softball is a
constant struggle. Kven if you're hitting
.400, that means you're failing six out of 10
times.
"I think I got my work ethic from my
dad," Mendoza said. "He is one of the
greatest coaches, but it was hard being the
daughter too. 1 gave him some of the dirt
iest looks and yelled and screamed at him
sometimes. He'd videotape my games in
high school, sit me down in front of the
I V., and say Look, see what you're doing
here.' I absolutely hated it."
I lie turning point came late in high
school for Mendoza when she finally real
ized her dad's persistence had made the
difference in her success.
For now, there is no end in sight for No.
21 as far as softball is concerned. She is one
of the game's true players who cherishes
the sport like a part of her soul.
"When I think of softball," said Men
doza, "1 think of hot scorching days out in
the outfield grass, the sweat beading down
your forehead and the distant murmur of
the crowds. 1 here is this whirlwind of
emotion there that cannot be described."
Pel haps it is the bittersweet blending of
all the memories piled up over the years,
the familiar faces of teammates old and
new and those moments of absolute ela
tion that seem to halt time and remind vou
wliv it is you play this game.
"Every player needs those reminders.
I hat the gain is in fact, worth the sacrifice.
"I think the best moments are the times
when every player is completely wrapped
up in the game. When you don't even
know who got the winning hit because it
leels like the whole team hit it."
"That's what you play for â€” for special
moments like that."
