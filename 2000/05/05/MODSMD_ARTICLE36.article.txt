It's a breezy, sunny Saturday at the
Stanford Softball complex. The fans,
decked out in Cardinal red and baseball
caps, squirm on the edge of the bleac h
ers in tingling anticipation.
Bring on any old Softball scenario:
bottom of the seventh, bases loaded,
and two outs situation, or just make it a
mid-game lead-oil attempt to put a run
on the board for the (Cardinal.
Either way, when the announcer
comes on the loud speaker and pro
claims the name Jessica Mendo/.a with
his emphatic flair, there's the familiar
sigh of relief the lans have had all season
to perfect.
Number 21 is exactly the person I hey
want at the plate.
Call her Mendoza, the Machine, the
Extraordinaire, the player who seems
immune to any sort of failure at the
plate.
Her batting average hovers at .4f>7
and boasts the No. 2 slot in all of college
Softball. She has already surpassed the
six single-season records she broke her
freshman year and appears on seven of
the I(Cardinal career statistics lists as a
sophomore.
In addition, this standout is racking
up Pacific 10 Conference I'layer of the
Week awards as if they were regular
pats on the back.
She is the only player this season to
be honored with three such titles and
may be on track this week to snag a
fourth after batting .857 last Tuesdav
against San Jose State.
Though her stats allow her to act oth
erwise, Mendoza couldn't be more
modest or unassuming, never daring to
take credit fora win or c asting blame on
those whose records may fall a little shy
of perfect.
She's a team player through and
through, who c redits her parents with
all the success she's experienced during
her time here at Stanford.

"My inoin and dad love coming to
the games. Alier all, tliey are the ones
who got me here. They did all the hours
of driving back and forth in traffic to get
me to practice every day."
In fact, it was her dad who intro
duced her to the game of softball, per
haps biased bv his position coaching the
Moorpart] College baseball team in
Ventura ('ounty, where Menclo/a grew
"I'-
ll ovvever, it wasn't hard to sell his

daughter on the sport. She dove right in
when she was seven, playing as one of
the only girls on a local boys' little league
team.
"I was an extremely energetic kid
who just loved all kinds of spoils," said
Menclo/a. "I was the hyperactive
tomboy type who had scars all over her
knees from playing football on the as
phalt with the boys in the neighbor
