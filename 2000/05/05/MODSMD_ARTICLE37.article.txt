On Saturday, the Cardinal
heads to Berkeley to compete in ihe
lOtith Big Meet against California.
I he dual meet will be a change of
pace in Stanford's invitational
packed spring schedule and a chal
lenge for athletes coming oil less
than a day's rest after Friday's
events.
According to head coach Yin
Lananua, the decision was made
when the meets were scheduled
that athletes would compete in both
meets, rather than splitting the
team into two squads as has hap
pened over the last two weekends.
"Fveryone competes on Satur
day." Lanannasaid. "Thev may run

different events, but they will do it
as if they were running prelims and
finals (in a weekend invitational.J"
While it appears to be a tough
double, Lananna believes the back
to-back meets will prove to be a
good test for the team.
"What could be perceived to be a
competitive disadvantage for ns will
turn out to be an advantage,"
Lananna said.
Competition between the two
schools should be close in this week
end's dual-meet format, in which
the two schools go head-to-head in
each event, with points awarded lor
the top three finishes in individual
events and to ihe winning team in
the relays.
1 Historically, Big Meet has been a
good opportunity for Stanford to
rally and unify as a team — an as
pect of track and field that may
seem under-emphasized in the race
lor qualifying times and big individ
ual performances important in
large invitationals.
Stanford heads into this year's
Big Meet with a 41-02-1 record in
men's competition against Cal,
while the Cardinal women hold a
I 1 -9 advantage over C '.al.
Last Near, the Hears came aw;iv
with <i 90-73 victor) at (lobb Track
and Angell Field in men's competi

tion.
Stanford won it's third-straight
women's title, 92-71.
While past Big Meets may have
been characterized as a battle be
tween Stanford's powerhouse dis
tance squad and Cal's strong sprints
and jump crews, Lananna believes
this year's match-up will prove to be
more balanced.
"There have been times where
there has been a disparity in events,
but they've improved in the areas
where they once used to be weaker,
and we've got ten better in the areas
we used to be weaker.
"We've kind of met in the mid
dle," Lananna said.
He names the men's 4-by-100-
meter relay, the 1,500 and the triple
jump as kc\ events for both schools.
Ihe Cardinal will likeK trv to
capitalize on the strength of its dis
tance runners to pull out the win
