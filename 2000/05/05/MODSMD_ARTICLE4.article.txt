### ELISABETH PRESSER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Universities are the scene of a ferocious
assault on free speech," University of Penn
sylvania Prof . Alan Kors said at a lecture last
night titled " The Assault Upon Liberty and
Dignity on America s Campuses."
Kors, who specializes in 17th and 18th
century European history, said today's col
lege c ampuses "promise academic freedom
but then deliver selective oppression"
through policies that discriminate on the
basis of sex, gender, political affiliation and
religion.
I le said that universities now designate all

Judeo-Christian European culture as the
source of all corruption and oppression,
promoting instead "any voices that chal
lenge it, and all voices that challenge it."
Kors cited examples of Andres Serrano's
"Piss (111 rist," a painting of the crucifixion on
which the artist urinated, and Robert Map
plethorpe's photograph of a black man uri
nating into the mouth a white man to illus
trate the limitations of freedom of expres
sion on college campuses.
These works, he said, are protected and
promoted as "free speech," regardless of
whom they may offend.
