New tccliix>log) is about to create a
sensation among members of Stanford
Federal Credit Union. Sources revealed that
after June IS, 2000.a prodnet ealled
LoanCliek w ill mean online loan approval
in about two minutes! My simply logging
onto the Stanford Federal Credit Union's
Web site (www.sfen.org) and elieking
LoanCliek, your mouse ean morph into a
car loan, personal loan or credit card.
An online loan application and
submission directly to the loan processing
facility make this kind of revolutionary
speed and convenience possible. Develop
ers, however, felt that having a literal
morphing of the mouse (wherein the.
mouse would be replaced by a new car or
credit card) was impractical.'The cord
attaching the vehicle or credit card to the
computer would make driving or spending
quite prohibitive." says one engineer.
Instead, a printable "Certificate of
Approval" will appear on your screen.
E-mails will be sent to you and to SFCU's
loan department confirming your approval.
When you need credit after June
1 Sth, point your mouse at LoanCliek and
enjoy speed and convenience like never
before.
