FOOL FOR CHRIST explores Dorothy Day's loves,
her spirituality and her politics that led to her
conversion to Catholicism. She was untiring in
her pursuit of social justice, peace and civil rights,
especially for the workers and the poor. Dorothy
credited God with bringing Peter Maurin to her.
Together, they started the Catholic Worker
Newspaper and the Catholic Worker Movement.
