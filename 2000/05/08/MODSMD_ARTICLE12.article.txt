1979
An even tan has always been a priority for
Stanford students. Twenty-one years ago,
the California Department of Recreation
considered opening "clothing-optional
beaches.
"In response to the question, "Is nude
sunbathing morally acceptable to you? stu
dents answered:
"Yes, there's nothing intrinsically wrong
with it. I'm just shy."
"No, it's not necessary to enjoying the sun
— it promotes eroticism."
A perceptive comment on the social fears
came from a student who said, "Nude sun
bathing is one of life's little pleasures. It need
not be equated with having sex in public (or
anywhere else). Public lovemaking should
be restricted — nude bathing should not be
banned.
The problem lies with the people who
view public sex and nude sunbathing as one
and the same issue, the student said.
One particularly animated proponent
said that "nude beaches are beneficial for
children and other living things." His re
sponse to the question on the morality of
bathing in the nude was: "Yes — Get rid of
the stody, Orange County morality."
The Bottom Line: The Flo Mo catwalks could be
a whole new world.
