After six seasons on Fox,
"Party of Five " closes shop with a
syrupy two-hour finale in which al
most everyone wants to get out of
town.. .. Their sister Claudia (Lacey
Chabert) has been accepted at Stan
ford University, but heck with that.
She wants to go to Juilliard in New
York. 'It was safe, and completely
doable,' she says of Stanford. That
part I like. In fact, I believe that's the
Stanford school motto: 'Safe, and
completely doable. *
Later, thinking of his deceased par
ents, Charlie delivers another love let
ter to San Francisco. 'If they were
alive,' he says, 'we all would have left
years ago.' Good grief, one bad 49ers
season and you'd think the whole burg
was Milwaukee.
