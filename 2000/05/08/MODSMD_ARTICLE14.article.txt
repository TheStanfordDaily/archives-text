## People protest U.S. raids

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP)
— College campuses closed, mili
tants protested and the National
Guard shielded U.S. installations
and public utilities Friday follow
ing a federal raid that dislodged
216 protesters from the Navy's
bombing range on Vieques
Island.
On Vieques, an anti-Navy
activist claimed that seven people
were still hiding on the range.
The Navy said it knew of no hold
outs and was planning to rapidly
resume training — a year after its
Atlantic fleet bombing range was
occupied.
Protests against the raid also
were announced on the U.S.
mainland. In downtown Philadel
phia, about 100 people protesting
outside a Navy recruiting office
snarled evening rush-hour traffic.
"It has unified the Puerto
Rican people like nothing I have
ever seen in my life," said
Philadelphia City Councilman
Angel Ortiz. "All of the resent
ments about the colonial situation
are being exhibited through
Vieques."
The 4 million American citi
zens who live on the U.S. territory
of Puerto Rico can serve in the
military but cannot vote for presi
dent or Congress. They receive
$13 billion a year in U.S. aid but
pay no federal taxes.
In Puerto Rico, police
increased security at Army and
Navy bases, federal courts in San
Juan and at U.S. military recruit
ing and post offices. Hundreds of
protesters briefly scuffled with
police at the U.S. Army base at
Fort Buchanan on Thursday.
Gov. Pedro Rossello ordered
enhanced security at public utili
ties. National Guard troops stood
watch at power plants, including
one at San Juan's international
airport, said utility spokesman
Freddy Marrero.
Nearly 5,000 members of the
electricity workers union staged a
four-hour protest Friday against

the Vieques raid.
In historic Old San Juan, hun
dreds of flag-waving protesters
demonstrated peacefully outside a
newly renovated federal court
house hours before it was to be
dedicated by judges and local offi
cials. But when former Gov. Luis
A. Ferre arrived for the ceremo
ny, several militant protesters
smashed the window of his car.
Ferre was not hurt
Protests by students — and in
some cases their professors —
shut down classes at colleges in
the cities of Ponce and Bayamon
and disrupted many classes at the
University of Puerto Rico's main
campus in San Juan.
On Vieques, where about 300
federal agents peacefully
removed 216 protesters from the
bombing range Thursday —
including religious leaders and
two U.S. members of Congress —
an activist claimed that some had
eluded the raid.
Carlos Zenon, head of the
Vieques Fishermen's Association,
said seven people, including two
of his sons, were at two "secret
camps" in the hilly /.one. Zenon
said he had spoken with son
Casimar by radio Friday.
"If they find them, they'll sur
render peacefully," Zenon said.
Navy Lt. Cmdr. Mark McDon
ald, a spokesman at the Joint
Information Center at Roosevelt
Roads, said military personnel
were patrolling the range but
had no information on any hold
outs.
Protesters occupied the Navy's
60-year-old Atlantic fleet range
in April 1999 after a civilian Navy
guard was killed in an accidental
bombing.
They stood in the way of a Jan.
31 accord between President
Clinton and Rossello allowing the
Navy to resume limited training
with inert bombs until 2003, with
a Vieques referendum to decide
whether the Navy can stay longer
and use live ammunition.
