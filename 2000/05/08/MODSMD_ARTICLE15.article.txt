ATLAN TA (AP) — Americans
lined up at convenience stores and
joined office pools fora shot at
instant riches as the jackpot in Fri
day night's Big Game drawing
swelled to $230 million — the sec
ond-largest lottery prize in ever.
"They say money can't buy hap
piness, but I'm willing to try," said
Kevin Stoerch of Escanaba, Mich.
Many players bought dozens
and even hundreds of $1 tickets,
apparently pooling their money
with co-workers or simply trying to
improve the odds. The odds of get
ting all six winning numbers were
one in more than 76 million.
The seven-state Big Game is
played in Georgia, Illinois, Mary
land, Massachusetts, Michigan,
New Jersey and Virginia. The jack
pot swelled from $5 million to $230

million after going eight weeks
without a winner.
"I'd l)e happy with .$5 million,"
said Robert Trasak, a 36-year-old
delivery driver and occasional lot
tery player who bought 20 tickets at
a Detroit gas station as the jackpot
climbed higher and higher. "But
something about $220 million
makes you say, I've really got to
win that one.'"
People from North Carolina
streamed into Charley's Stop and
Shop in Danville, Va., to play.
"It's been terrible today," said
clerk Kaye Dicks, who saw the line
grow to more than 50. "They've
had their hands full of cash."
At the Pilot Travel Center near
the Alabama state line, a line of 40
ticket buyers stretched out the
door and around the building.
