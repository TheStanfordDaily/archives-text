BFTFAST, Northern Ireland
(AP) — The prime ministers of
Britain and Ireland announced an
ambitious plan Friday for restoring
power to Northern Ireland's sus
pended Catholic-Protestant admin
istration by May 22.
Speaking shortly before mid
night following more than 30
hours of negotiations with local
parties, Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern and British Prime Minister
Pony Blair said all sides had agreed
to set the "target date" for resum
ing power-sharing.
" I he two governments have put
proposals to the parties, and sub
ject to a positive response, it will be
the intention of the governments to
reinstate the institutions on the
22nd of May," Blair said at Hills
borough Castle, the negotiating
venue southwest of Belfast.
May 22 is the second anniver
sary of the overwhelming ratifica
tion of the Good Friday peace
accord in public relerendums.
Ihe historic pact also made the
date the deadline for Northern Ire
land's rival paramilitary groups to
disarm, an unfulfilled goal that has
repeated!) stvmied wider political
pre )gress.
A linchpin of the prime minis
ters' new plan is to extend that
deadline for total disarmament to
June 2001 —a concession likely to
liic-l Protestant opposition to the
propc >sal.

A four-party coalition involving
l lit- IRA-allied Sinn Fein party took
office in Northern Ireland in
December, but Britain suspended
the administration's powers in
February after the Irish Republican
Arm) refused to begin disarming as
part of the deal.
Both Blair and Ahern empha
sized that they couldn't force
Protestant politicians to resume
sharing power with Sinn Fein.
They said, a positive response
soon from the outlawed IRA would
be essential for the four-party
administration to regain its author
ity by May 22.
"It's now incumbent upon the
parties, and perhaps in particular
the paramilitary organizations,'to
give their response to the proposals
we've made," Blair said, Ahern
standing at his side.
"I very much hope that tlwt
response is positive, and in particu
lar that we can make sure that the
arms issue is dealt with completely
and verifiably."
Ahern added, "I'd be very dis
appointed if the response from the
paramilitaries was not extremely
p< >sitive."
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams,
speaking after the prime ministers,
said he welcomed the publication
of the governments' joint plan as "a
very decisive moment." But he
declined to speculate on how the
IRA would respond.
