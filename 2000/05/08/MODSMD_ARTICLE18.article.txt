# Alignment of planets arrives without a bang
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — An
alignment of the sun, moon and
the live brightest planets arrived
Friday without the disasters prc
du ted by some doomsayers.
I he tightest alignment of Mer
cury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Sat
urn, the sun and the moon — as
seen from Earth — since 1962
took place at 1:08 a.m., said Jane
Piatt, a spokeswoman tor NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena.
The whole grouping couldn't
be seen in the skv, however,
because the other planets were on
the other side of the sun and its
glare washed them out.
" l lie planets would be a bunch
of little fireflies in (lie midst of a
searchlight," Piatt said.
Planetary alignments occur
when three <>r more celestial
objects move into positions so that
a straight line could be drawn
through their centers. But the
definition is a bit loose: Planets
that appear close togethei in the
sky are considered aligned.
Various planetary alignments
occur about every 20 years and no

special astronomical
were planned, Piatt said.
"For astronomers, it's just
another day," she said.
Not to doomsayers, though,
who predicted everything from a
stock market crash to monster
tidal waves.
Richard Noone's book,
"5/5/2000: Ice, The Ultimate Dis
aster.'' suggested that gravitation
al pull from the alignment, cou
pled with increased solar activity,
would trigger a chain of events
causing massive earthquakes and
tidal waves.
Noone, who lives in the seismi
calh sale and tidal wave-protected
mountains near Pine Ridge, Ga.,
said Friday that he would be
"extremely happy' if his predic
tions are wrong.
The moon was moving out of
alignment Friday. But the plane
tary grouping will remain until
about Mav IS. Noone said Earth
was in"the dangei /one' until
then.
"1 think these disasters will
happen." he said. "I feel that the
probability is lairh high.
