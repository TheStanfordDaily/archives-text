JOLO, Philippines (AP) — Two days after Muslim
rebels holed up on this island claimed that two of
their foreign hostages had died, negotiators report
edly have confirmed that all 21 of the captives,
including 10 foreign tourists, are alive.
The negotiators have resumed contacts with the
Abu Sayyaf rebels, several villagers in touch with the
negotiators said Friday. The rebels were able to
break through a military cordon and were holding
their hostages at a single location outside the area,
said the villagers, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
The Jolo hostages are 10 Malaysians, three Ger
mans, two French nationals, two South Africans, two
Finns, one Lebanese and one Filipino. They were
kidnapped April 23 from Sipacfan Island, a
Malaysian diving resort, and taken by boat to Jolo, a
southern Philippine island about one hour away.
Contacts between the kidnappers and negotiators
were cut earlier this week after hundreds of govern
ment troops encircled the area where the hostages
were being held in a simple bamboo hut. A series of
clashes erupted on Tuesday and Wednesday as the
rebels tried to escape.

On Wednesday, the rebels claimed two of the for
eign hostages had died — one from a stray bullet
and one of a heart attack. Government officials have
said those claims were unconfirmed, and troops who
seized the bamboo hut said they found no bodies or
bloodstains.
The government-appointed negotiators, led bv
former Muslim rebel leader Nut Misuari, sent sever
al representatives to meet quietly with the kidnap
pers at their new hide-out on Thursday, the people
in touch with the negotiators said.
All 21 hostages were in the same house with the
rebels, they said, contradicting earlier reports that
the hostages had been divided into five groups. I he\
said that on the basis of Thursday's contact, ;i team
of negotiators arrived Friday and planned to go into
the mountains to meet the kidnappers.
Earlier in the week, the rebels had threatened to
behead two foreign hostages if the military did not
back off. A rebel leader, Abu Kscobar, said in ;i radio
interview broadcast Friday that tlu- group is dis
cussing whether to go through with the threat.
"We will see. If the situation remains, the surprise
may happen," fie tolcl DXRX radio.
