new conservation and use plan
for the Stanford Dish area, hackles have
been raised on ;ill sides, protesting every

vcrsit) and should be applauded on that
level, regardless ol its shortcomings.
I lie new plan, whit li will take lull effect
on Sept. I, seeks to preserve the Dish area,
maintain it lor academic use and provide a

recreational space lor the Stanford commu
nity and its neighbors. According to Casper,
the plan addresses problems with parking,
traffic congestion and safety near the Dish, as
well as the general degradation of the
Foothills, including the threat to native
species caused by increased hiking and peo
ple jogging olf paved roads.
The plan limits recreational use of the
Dish area by prohibiting hiking and jogging
off the delineated routes, forbidding dogs,
picnics, games and social events and allowing
rec rcational access from dawn until a half an
hour before sunset.
In creating this plan, Stanford had to
manage and reconcile a plethora of compel

ing interests — environmental, educational
and recreational, among others. The Uni
versity's effort to protect environmental
interests is admirable, as is its commitment to
maintaining a positive relationship with com
munity members.
However, despite the fact that Stanford
has chosen to allow area residents to contin
ue using this area, the restrictions placed
upon that use seem almost deliberately
geared to discourage Palo Alto residents
from utilizing the Dish area.
Specifically, the restriction on dogs direct
ly affects many area residents far more than
students, who are not allowed to own pets of
any kind in University housing. Many area

residents, given this new restriction, will be
forced to walk their dogs elsewhere, proba
bly keeping them from spending significant
amounts of time in the Dish area.
This obvious slant on the restrictions indi
cates that, although the University has a vest
ed interest in maintaining a good relation
ship with the surrounding community, this
plan only achieves that to a small degree,
serving instead as a thinly veiled attempt to
discourage area residents from using the
Dish area. If this was, in fact, one of the goals
of the plan, the University should have stat
ed this overtly instead of shedding an unnec
essarily negative light on an otherwise com
mendable plan.
