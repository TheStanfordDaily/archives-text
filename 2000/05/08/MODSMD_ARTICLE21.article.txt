# WHAT THE HECK I'M TALKING ABOUT
## Lessons from Burma 
### 
As I < liosc i lie topic lor 111 \ col
mnn this week, 1 encountered a
dilemma. A < lassniale (win> is
also a kniglit Fellow) gave me a
lead on .1 campus issue, lie had gone
into tin- I rack Shop to purchase one ol
those ililt\ Stantonl jackets, and realized
at the cashier's counter that the tag read:
"Made in Mvanmar." Myanmar, oi
But ma, is notorious loi its government's
human rights violations and is tlx- subject

of several I S. sane
lions. I lie M\anm;n
w mdl)i eaker prompt s
ilic <{ ii est ion: Why
liasn'l Stanford passed
;i resolution lo dives I
11« >111 ((tmpanies I hat (l< >
business with bin ma?
I'.MI I saw two main
problems with iliis col
umn idea. ()ue, I knew
vcr\ lit IU- about the

issue. I saw the movie "llevond Rangoon
when I was in high s< liool, I>ill somehow I
don't 11 link I bat eon ills. I o make .1 stand,
you have to be informed, right?
I wo, voice. I have to maintain my
voice. I usually write about running in
spoils bras, unpopulat universal lan
guages, that sort ol thing. Who wants me
lo pul on in\ serious lace? Who's gonna
believe I even have sik Ii a thing?
Hut I decided lo ai least research and
see what I could find out.
Ina matter ol minutes I found a recent
report from tin- I lie ( onuuission on
I Indian Rights, alleging that the military
1 cgiinc in M van marl on< tones rape, mur
der and forced laboi amounting to slav
ery. (children as young as eight were used
.is unpaid laborers lo help build .1 temple.
I'orters forced lo work lor the military
were unfed and lied to yokes at night.
The report stated several abuses of
ethnic minorities, especially in Shan and
Karen states on the Thailand border.
Well-documented violations include sev
eral massacres In M van mar troops of
Karen villagci s. one in which a nine-year
old girl and a pregnant woman were
gang-raped before lu ing murdered in
their village. I"he Karens have fought a
f> 1-year battle lor greater autonomy from
the central military regime.
()ficn von read alx ml < rimes and atroc
ities and wonder whether economic sanc
tions against the country in question are
really helpful lo llic people. I low would a
boycott of llurma-invcslcd companies
improve the lot of a Karen villager?
From "Meyoiul Rangoon," I remem
bered the name of the Nobel peace prize
winner Aung San, the peaceful political
leader who led <1 non-violent uprising
against the Myanmar government in the

carl\ 19905. A quick Internet search tor
"Aung San led to a 199S Business Week
article entitled, " lake Your Investments
I'.lsewl lere, Please."
Aung San Suu Kyi strongly stated her
position that investment currently only
harms the people ol Burma: "We want
investment to he at the right time, when
the benefits will go to the people ol
But ma, not just toa small, select elite con
nected to the government.
"II companies from Western democra
cies are prepared to invest under these
circumstances, then it gives the military
regime reason to think that, after all, they
(,in continue with violating human rights
because even Western business compa
nies don't mind."
So, on to the final question — what is
Stanford's position?
In Apiil I'.MMi the ASS I passed a reso
lution calling on the ( Diversity to adopt a
Selective Purchasing resolution, which
was not passed. I'cxaco and I'epsi Co.
have pulled out ol Burma sinec I99f>, but
I not al has not. I lie I Diversity has never
eschewed anv companies based on
whethei thev do business in Burma.
So, hasicallv, Stanford lias no position.
Now, I admit that 1 don't know every
thing about the situation in Burma. I
know that civil unrest continues and that
thousands have sullered or died at tlie
hands ol the military regime there. I
don't know that the decision to boycott a
clothing retailer will save someone's life
on the otliei side ol the world.
Bill it might. At the very least, eco
nomic sanctions send a positive message
of Western support to the democracy
movement, and a negative message to the
repressive military regime.
I urge you, it you're concerned, to
remind the University of the importance
ol these sanctions, or work with the ASSU
to draft another resolution.
And, as tor mv dilemma, Aung San
Sun kvi taught me a lew things this week
end. She wrote, "I see my lite ... as part
of a proi ession, a dynamic process, doing
all that we can do to move toward more
good and justice; a process that is not iso
lated from what has happened before or
what will come after."
My dec isiou to write this column comes
from Aiuig Sail's theory: if there's even
the possibility that my action could enact
positive change, then I want to take it.
And I don't have to know everything to
put on my serious lace and say something.
