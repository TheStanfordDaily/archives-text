### 
Asian scholars program deserves
continued support
1 read with great disappointment Fri
day's article, "Inadequate funds doom
Asian scholars program." The cancellation
of this program is all the more unfortunate
because the scholars involved clearly value
their education much more than their
stipends and are willing to do without the
latter to achieve the goal of encouraging
greater leadership among students from
the Asia-Pacific region.
It is my belief that Stanford has the
potential to become a center for Asian and
Asian-American studies and research. Its
position in the Bay Area gives it access to
an enormous wealth, not only of cultures,
but also of educated people as well. The
booming growth of Asia, both the Pacific
Rim region and South Asia, offers oppor
tunities that Stanford, with its position in
Silicon Valley, is uniquely poised to take
advantage of.
Unfortunately, the University has con
sistently chosen not to do so and, as a
result, I believe that Stanford's approach
to Asian and Asian-American studies has
been less than ideal, especially when com
pared with other universities, such as those
in the UC system.
I strongly urge that this program not be
discontinued, and that the efforts to advo
cate and improve Asian and Asian-Ameri

can studies at the University be redoubled
among faculty, students, and the adminis
tration. Without strong studies in this area,
Stanford may no longer be perceived as
being up to date with the scholarly issues
and academic problems that we face at the
beginning of the 21st century.

Give to class gift, not Alumni Association
1 his is an open letter to all Stanford stu
dents from the Secretary of the Class of
1937. 1 am not a grouch, I support Stan
ford with all my heart. I love Gerhard, the
Band, the faculty, the campus, the stu
dents and our teams! My class lias con
tributed to the Stanford Annual Fund at a
rate of over 90 percent for three years and
will for the few years we still have. I have
led our reunions for (>() years.
I have had close dealings with the
Office Of Development and the Alumni
Association for years. I have supported
Stanford every year since graduation and
have given one gift of over one half of my
wife Jetty's (Class of 1957) and my net
worth. I believe that the friends I made at
Stanford since my freshman year in 1933
are the greatest source of pleasure in my
happy life.

You students are going to be the van
guard of a new Stanford Spirit that is jusi
being introduced. You will elect class offi
cers before graduation and you will be
taught how to organize your classes for the
rest of your lives. You will be given respon
sibilities to keep your class alive and having
fun together, run your own reunions and
be in competition with all the Stanford
classes for highest annual giving to The
Stanford Annual Fund.
Seniors, please give to the "class gift"
and give a little next year and the next.
But do not "join" the Alumni Associa
tion. Save that money for your clasjs
treasury that will build over the yeai>
for your class to use as it sees fit. SAA
says you will have a "life subscription" to
the alumni magazine. That is false!
Every graduate gets it now. There is n(>
place at Stanford for two classes <tf
alumni, privileged and not. Fell SAA
President Bill Stone loud and clear that
your membership is in your class and ;us
an alumnus the same as everyone else.
At another time I will give my opinions
of the confusing manner of accounting fin
(lit* Stanford Annual Fund. It is not well
done!

University should strike balance between
community and student relations
The recent controversy over the use of
the Stanford Foothills will cause me to look
back at my final year at and the future of
Stanford with sadness. Using a well known
strategy of embracing the protester's agen
da and using it against them, the Universi
ty cited environmental reasons for the
Foothills' use restrictions.
A few months earlier, the University
lacked such lofty environmental concerns
when it planned to decrease the Foothills to
make room for additional suburban cam
pus sprawl. Nor did the University show
such concern during the reservoir construc
tion. It is no surprise that living in this area
is stressful. Increasing population growth
has not only resulted in exorbitant housing
costs, but has affected us in a number of
ways.
Yet, amidst this growing stress pool, the
University's beautiful Foothills have served
as an oasis for the community. What better
way is there to escape the stresses of the Sil
icon Valley life than to take the path less
traveled, to swing from a tree, or to take
part in a dog's joy at being away from the
c ity block?
The University's desire is to decrease
the community's use of the Foothills so
future development will be free of contro
versy, but in doing so, they are not only
punishing the community for their hin
drance of the 10-year development plan,
but also punishing their own students.
Students with a variety of backgrounds,
goals and ideals have historically taken
advantage of the nearby Foothills, and the
University has recently categorized this
demonstrated use as misuse. Stanford is
prohibiting their own students from enjoy
ing a peaceful time away from the aca
demic and personal stresses that the very
nature of this place creates. The Universi
ty administration is quenching the creativ
ity and sharing of ideas that occurs during
a walk away from the "world" or a romp
with a much loved pet. They are confining
that joy to a paved loop.
In effect, they are telling their students
that the enjoyment they have received
from jogging on the remote trails, discov

eriug tarantulas on a hot clay or just escap
ing the rushing stream of life fora few
minutes has NO value. What is of higher
value to the University is a base demon
stration of its power to the surrounding
community.
I challenge the University to rise above
its disgustingly petty response to the com
munity's outrage with their development
plans and to realize that the role of the
University should be a good and beneficial
neighbor and as such welcome the com
munity's input. 1 challenge the University
to rise above the suburban norms that
plague our society and develop the cam
pus in a socially, environmentally and
architecturally innovative way. I challenge
the University to embrace its role as a
provider of a natural outlet for its students
and the community at large.
1 hope the University will take on this
challenge and demonstrate that it truly
cares more about its students' well-being
than prestige or the hollow bottom line
and thus prevent this from becoming the
saddest of endings.

Class of 1994

Looking at Cuba in perspective
and from the inside
(idling to know the true Cuba can be
difficult. One can read about it in books
often written with some underlying politi
cal leaning, one can visit and interact with
the Cubans of different levels of civil-soci
ety or one can extrapolate an "under
standing" based on the portrayal of Cuba
in the media, from the news to the latest
Cuban music collection.
Having tried to combine all three, and
having talked with math teachers, old
school revolutionaries, 1 ropicana dancers,
jazz piano stars, and the average, young,
energetic, smiling, good-natured, full-of
laughter Cubans, we would like to offer
some fads and a new perspective regard
ing Jason Rheins' opinion ("A new view on
Elian Oonzalez," April 27) and the
responses it has received from liana
Murillo ("Rhetoric surrounding Elian typ
ical and skewed" May 2) and Lisa (]hen ("A
new perspective on Elian," May 1).
Before delving into the notes from our
travels in Cuba, some statistics should
accompany us on our journey: within Litin
America, Cuba has the lowest infant moral
ity rate, best access to safe water, second

highest adult literacy rate and mean years of
schooling, highest performance on stan
dardized tests, highest life-expectancy,
highest ratio of doctors per capita and high
est daily calorie supply (for 1988-1990).
Not a "normal" country? True. It has
chosen a different path, challenging U.S.
influence — something admired by the
countries behind them on so many of
those statistics — and, in the process, Cuba
has arguably suffered fewer human rights
violations than Chile, a country the United
States has publicly acclaimed for its eco
nomic "transformation" during the era of
Pinochet. Cuba has the respect of many
nations, as reflected in the recent vote by
the United Nations concerning the U.S.
embargo. The vote was 149 to 2, Israel and
the United States being the only countries
in favor.
Cuba does have serious problems: civil
rights are limited, free speech is not offi
cially sanctioned, and you can go to any
human rights Web page and see a long list
of crimes. Of course, you could also check
out the same reports on the United States
and you might start wondering about our
own freedom, but Murillo has done a
more than adequate job with this point.
Rheins states that, "The wealth pro
duced in a capitalist country ... virtually
ensures a well being for citizens that is vast
ly better than can be expected in a social
ized country." It is very true that Elian will
not have the same comforts and luxuries
that he would be given here in the United
States. He will not have Nintendo or Fritos
or even the same quantities of milk and
meat, and he will not have such extensive
freedom of speech.
Considering the caloric intake statistic,
however, you would get the same impres
sion that we had sitting around Cuban din
ner tables: Cubans eat well enough, espe
cially the children. It is true that since 1990
many Cubans have been losing weight as
they have suffered economic depression in
the wake of the collapse of the Soviet
Union, yet their kids continue to Ix* well
cared for and well led.
Upon his return to Cuba, Elian would
find a culture far less focused on material
gain, a society where family and friends
take precedence, where culture does not
equal individualism and productivity. He
would grow up healthy and well educated.
Having lived and studied in Havana,
we find Rheins' comment that Cuba is a
"slave state"a gross distortion of the cur
rent state of the island. The comment that
F.lian will "enter a hard labor and indoctri

nation camp at the age of 11" and the con
clusion that upon his possible return he
"will live as a slave or Ik* murdered by Cas
tro's government" were bordering on the
ridiculous.
We have met and interacted with c hil
dren in Cuba, and they live quite free lives.
They go to school and play with friends —
none of which accords with the unfounded
claims of child labor camps and state-spon
sored homicide. The fact of the matter is
that there are no "enslavement and indoc
trination camps" for children and a child
hood in Cuba does not in the least resem
ble what we think of as slavery.
In Lisa Chen's response, we were
intrigued by the statement that it "may be
in the best interests of a child from South
Central Los Angeles to grow up in Palo
Alto," but we would like to avoid the dras
tic error of comparing South Central to
Cuba and Palo Alto to the United States.
One might argue that Palo Alto and
South Central, both in the U.S., are two
sides of the same coin, not that it is fair to
portray South Central as the city of pover
ty and gangs and Palo Alto as that of
wealth and up-right citizens, but that
seems to be the juxtaposition suggested.
Considering the analogy to Cuba, I
have never heard of a drive-by in Havana
nor ever seen a homeless person on the
street in any urban or rural area. There
are poor people who hang out in the street
during the day, but they are not Vietnam
vets ignored by society or high-school
dropouts unable to learn in overcrowded,
dangerous schools, but rather they are all
well-educated and can go to the hospital to
receive top-quality attention whenever ill.
Moreover, when you ask them what
they think about the government, they will
often tell you they think it stinks. When I
asked them to rank their problems, Fidel
usually came in a tie with the U.S. embar
go for the number one spot. Though
Cubans did achieve 5 percent growth in
1999 according to the World Bank, they
would be living much better lives without
the U.S. government's horrendous policy
toward them. Some law-makers and citi
zens of the United Suites may wish that
Cuba were more like South Central and
that the United States were an idyllic
nationwide Palo Alto, but the wish is in
vain on both counts.
What we saw and heard is only one part
of the picture, and it is true that we had
dollars and we were foreigners who could
leave at any time, but the rights that we
enjoyed are slowly being extended to more

of the country. A slow process of heafthy,
marginal change is underway that **ill
allow Cuba, hopefully, to retain the
that it has achieved in the last four decades,
but also bring in the benefits ol'more polit
ical freedom and market efficiency.
Reforms are already underway in Cuba
to extend the small market economy,-and
free local elections art* allowing for more
participation from opposition candidates.
The efforts at expanding political freedom
might also be further underway if it were
not for the U.S.'s policy which exacerbates
the government's centralization of political
authority.
So, legal arguments aside and some}
propaganda debunked, where would
Elian live better? We both can say we felt
safer walking around the streets of Santia-r
go de Cuba, Havana and Varadero at 3
a.m. than we would around any street in
South Central or Palo Alto.
In the Cuban night, you could probably
even find in a stranger a friendly face that
would invite you to dance a little rumba ill
the street or share a bottle of ruin and talk
about Ernest Hemingway. But please do
not let ideals cloud your own answer to this
question. Read some books written on the
subject, travel there, talk with people who
have traveled there.
In fact, we would like to invite our
friend Jason to a discussion of the issue of
Elian and U.S.-Cuban relations. Please feel
free to write us at larisas@stanford.edu
and klenipn@stanford.edu. Informed dia
logue will offer one of the best paths to
understanding Cuba.

University should strike balance between
community and student relations
The recent controversy over the use of
the Stanford Foothills will cause me to look
back at my final year at and the future of
Stanford with sadness. Using a well known
strategy of embracing the protester's agen
da and using it against them, the Universi
ty cited environmental reasons for the
Foothills' use restrictions.
A few months earlier, the University
lacked such lofty environmental concerns
when it planned to decrease the Foothills to
make room for additional suburban cam
pus sprawl. Nor did the University show
such concern during the reservoir construc
tion. It is no surprise that living in this area
is stressful. Increasing population growth
has not only resulted in exorbitant housing
costs, but has affected us in a number of
ways.
Yet, amidst this growing stress pool, the
University's beautiful Foothills have served
as an oasis for the community. What better
way is there to escape the stresses of the Sil
icon Valley life than to take the path less
traveled, to swing from a tree, or to take
part in a dog's joy at being away from the
c ity block?
The University's desire is to decrease
the community's use of the Foothills so
future development will be free of contro
versy, but in doing so, they are not only
punishing the community for their hin
drance of the 10-year development plan,
but also punishing their own students.
Students with a variety of backgrounds,
goals and ideals have historically taken
advantage of the nearby Foothills, and the
University has recently categorized this
demonstrated use as misuse. Stanford is
prohibiting their own students from enjoy
ing a peaceful time away from the aca
demic and personal stresses that the very
nature of this place creates. The Universi
ty administration is quenching the creativ
ity and sharing of ideas that occurs during
a walk away from the "world" or a romp
with a much loved pet. They are confining
that joy to a paved loop.
In effect, they are telling their students
that the enjoyment they have received
from jogging on the remote trails, discov

eriug tarantulas on a hot clay or just escap
ing the rushing stream of life fora few
minutes has NO value. What is of higher
value to the University is a base demon
stration of its power to the surrounding
community.
I challenge the University to rise above
its disgustingly petty response to the com
munity's outrage with their development
plans and to realize that the role of the
University should be a good and beneficial
neighbor and as such welcome the com
munity's input. 1 challenge the University
to rise above the suburban norms that
plague our society and develop the cam
pus in a socially, environmentally and
architecturally innovative way. I challenge
the University to embrace its role as a
provider of a natural outlet for its students
and the community at large.
1 hope the University will take on this
challenge and demonstrate that it truly
cares more about its students' well-being
than prestige or the hollow bottom line
and thus prevent this from becoming the
saddest of endings.

Class of 1994

Looking at Cuba in perspective
and from the inside
(idling to know the true Cuba can be
difficult. One can read about it in books
often written with some underlying politi
cal leaning, one can visit and interact with
the Cubans of different levels of civil-soci
ety or one can extrapolate an "under
standing" based on the portrayal of Cuba
in the media, from the news to the latest
Cuban music collection.
Having tried to combine all three, and
having talked with math teachers, old
school revolutionaries, 1 ropicana dancers,
jazz piano stars, and the average, young,
energetic, smiling, good-natured, full-of
laughter Cubans, we would like to offer
some fads and a new perspective regard
ing Jason Rheins' opinion ("A new view on
Elian Oonzalez," April 27) and the
responses it has received from liana
Murillo ("Rhetoric surrounding Elian typ
ical and skewed" May 2) and Lisa (]hen ("A
new perspective on Elian," May 1).
Before delving into the notes from our
travels in Cuba, some statistics should
accompany us on our journey: within Litin
America, Cuba has the lowest infant moral
ity rate, best access to safe water, second

highest adult literacy rate and mean years of
schooling, highest performance on stan
dardized tests, highest life-expectancy,
highest ratio of doctors per capita and high
est daily calorie supply (for 1988-1990).
Not a "normal" country? True. It has
chosen a different path, challenging U.S.
influence — something admired by the
countries behind them on so many of
those statistics — and, in the process, Cuba
has arguably suffered fewer human rights
violations than Chile, a country the United
States has publicly acclaimed for its eco
nomic "transformation" during the era of
Pinochet. Cuba has the respect of many
nations, as reflected in the recent vote by
the United Nations concerning the U.S.
embargo. The vote was 149 to 2, Israel and
the United States being the only countries
in favor.
Cuba does have serious problems: civil
rights are limited, free speech is not offi
cially sanctioned, and you can go to any
human rights Web page and see a long list
of crimes. Of course, you could also check
out the same reports on the United States
and you might start wondering about our
own freedom, but Murillo has done a
more than adequate job with this point.
Rheins states that, "The wealth pro
duced in a capitalist country ... virtually
ensures a well being for citizens that is vast
ly better than can be expected in a social
ized country." It is very true that Elian will
not have the same comforts and luxuries
that he would be given here in the United
States. He will not have Nintendo or Fritos
or even the same quantities of milk and
meat, and he will not have such extensive
freedom of speech.
Considering the caloric intake statistic,
however, you would get the same impres
sion that we had sitting around Cuban din
ner tables: Cubans eat well enough, espe
cially the children. It is true that since 1990
many Cubans have been losing weight as
they have suffered economic depression in
the wake of the collapse of the Soviet
Union, yet their kids continue to Ix* well
cared for and well led.
Upon his return to Cuba, Elian would
find a culture far less focused on material
gain, a society where family and friends
take precedence, where culture does not
equal individualism and productivity. He
would grow up healthy and well educated.
Having lived and studied in Havana,
we find Rheins' comment that Cuba is a
"slave state"a gross distortion of the cur
rent state of the island. The comment that
F.lian will "enter a hard labor and indoctri

nation camp at the age of 11" and the con
clusion that upon his possible return he
"will live as a slave or Ik* murdered by Cas
tro's government" were bordering on the
ridiculous.
We have met and interacted with c hil
dren in Cuba, and they live quite free lives.
They go to school and play with friends —
none of which accords with the unfounded
claims of child labor camps and state-spon
sored homicide. The fact of the matter is
that there are no "enslavement and indoc
trination camps" for children and a child
hood in Cuba does not in the least resem
ble what we think of as slavery.
In Lisa Chen's response, we were
intrigued by the statement that it "may be
in the best interests of a child from South
Central Los Angeles to grow up in Palo
Alto," but we would like to avoid the dras
tic error of comparing South Central to
Cuba and Palo Alto to the United States.
One might argue that Palo Alto and
South Central, both in the U.S., are two
sides of the same coin, not that it is fair to
portray South Central as the city of pover
ty and gangs and Palo Alto as that of
wealth and up-right citizens, but that
seems to be the juxtaposition suggested.
Considering the analogy to Cuba, I
have never heard of a drive-by in Havana
nor ever seen a homeless person on the
street in any urban or rural area. There
are poor people who hang out in the street
during the day, but they are not Vietnam
vets ignored by society or high-school
dropouts unable to learn in overcrowded,
dangerous schools, but rather they are all
well-educated and can go to the hospital to
receive top-quality attention whenever ill.
Moreover, when you ask them what
they think about the government, they will
often tell you they think it stinks. When I
asked them to rank their problems, Fidel
usually came in a tie with the U.S. embar
go for the number one spot. Though
Cubans did achieve 5 percent growth in
1999 according to the World Bank, they
would be living much better lives without
the U.S. government's horrendous policy
toward them. Some law-makers and citi
zens of the United Suites may wish that
Cuba were more like South Central and
that the United States were an idyllic
nationwide Palo Alto, but the wish is in
vain on both counts.
What we saw and heard is only one part
of the picture, and it is true that we had
dollars and we were foreigners who could
leave at any time, but the rights that we
enjoyed are slowly being extended to more

of the country. A slow process of heafthy,
marginal change is underway that **ill
allow Cuba, hopefully, to retain the
that it has achieved in the last four decades,
but also bring in the benefits ol'more polit
ical freedom and market efficiency.
Reforms are already underway in Cuba
to extend the small market economy,-and
free local elections art* allowing for more
participation from opposition candidates.
The efforts at expanding political freedom
might also be further underway if it were
not for the U.S.'s policy which exacerbates
the government's centralization of political
authority.
So, legal arguments aside and some}
propaganda debunked, where would
Elian live better? We both can say we felt
safer walking around the streets of Santia-r
go de Cuba, Havana and Varadero at 3
a.m. than we would around any street in
South Central or Palo Alto.
In the Cuban night, you could probably
even find in a stranger a friendly face that
would invite you to dance a little rumba ill
the street or share a bottle of ruin and talk
about Ernest Hemingway. But please do
not let ideals cloud your own answer to this
question. Read some books written on the
subject, travel there, talk with people who
have traveled there.
In fact, we would like to invite our
friend Jason to a discussion of the issue of
Elian and U.S.-Cuban relations. Please feel
free to write us at larisas@stanford.edu
and klenipn@stanford.edu. Informed dia
logue will offer one of the best paths to
understanding Cuba.

Asian scholars program deserves
continued support
1 read with great disappointment Fri
day's article, "Inadequate funds doom
Asian scholars program." The cancellation
of this program is all the more unfortunate
because the scholars involved clearly value
their education much more than their
stipends and are willing to do without the
latter to achieve the goal of encouraging
greater leadership among students from
the Asia-Pacific region.
It is my belief that Stanford has the
potential to become a center for Asian and
Asian-American studies and research. Its
position in the Bay Area gives it access to
an enormous wealth, not only of cultures,
but also of educated people as well. The
booming growth of Asia, both the Pacific
Rim region and South Asia, offers oppor
tunities that Stanford, with its position in
Silicon Valley, is uniquely poised to take
advantage of.
Unfortunately, the University has con
sistently chosen not to do so and, as a
result, I believe that Stanford's approach
to Asian and Asian-American studies has
been less than ideal, especially when com
pared with other universities, such as those
in the UC system.
I strongly urge that this program not be
discontinued, and that the efforts to advo
cate and improve Asian and Asian-Ameri

can studies at the University be redoubled
among faculty, students, and the adminis
tration. Without strong studies in this area,
Stanford may no longer be perceived as
being up to date with the scholarly issues
and academic problems that we face at the
beginning of the 21st century.

A few months earlier, the University
lacked such lofty environmental concerns
when it planned to decrease the Foothills to
make room for additional suburban cam
pus sprawl. Nor did the University show
such concern during the reservoir construc
tion. It is no surprise that living in this area
is stressful. Increasing population growth
has not only resulted in exorbitant housing
costs, but has affected us in a number of
ways.
Yet, amidst this growing stress pool, the
University's beautiful Foothills have served
as an oasis for the community. What better
way is there to escape the stresses of the Sil
icon Valley life than to take the path less
traveled, to swing from a tree, or to take
part in a dog's joy at being away from the
c ity block?
The University's desire is to decrease
the community's use of the Foothills so
future development will be free of contro
versy, but in doing so, they are not only
punishing the community for their hin
drance of the 10-year development plan,
but also punishing their own students.
Students with a variety of backgrounds,
goals and ideals have historically taken
advantage of the nearby Foothills, and the
University has recently categorized this
demonstrated use as misuse. Stanford is
prohibiting their own students from enjoy
ing a peaceful time away from the aca
demic and personal stresses that the very
nature of this place creates. The Universi
ty administration is quenching the creativ
ity and sharing of ideas that occurs during
a walk away from the "world" or a romp
with a much loved pet. They are confining
that joy to a paved loop.
In effect, they are telling their students
that the enjoyment they have received
from jogging on the remote trails, discov

eriug tarantulas on a hot clay or just escap
ing the rushing stream of life fora few
minutes has NO value. What is of higher
value to the University is a base demon
stration of its power to the surrounding
community.
I challenge the University to rise above
its disgustingly petty response to the com
munity's outrage with their development
plans and to realize that the role of the
University should be a good and beneficial
neighbor and as such welcome the com
munity's input. 1 challenge the University
to rise above the suburban norms that
plague our society and develop the cam
pus in a socially, environmentally and
architecturally innovative way. I challenge
the University to embrace its role as a
provider of a natural outlet for its students
and the community at large.
1 hope the University will take on this
challenge and demonstrate that it truly
cares more about its students' well-being
than prestige or the hollow bottom line
and thus prevent this from becoming the
saddest of endings.

Looking at Cuba in perspective
and from the inside
(idling to know the true Cuba can be
difficult. One can read about it in books
often written with some underlying politi
cal leaning, one can visit and interact with
the Cubans of different levels of civil-soci
ety or one can extrapolate an "under
standing" based on the portrayal of Cuba
in the media, from the news to the latest
Cuban music collection.
Having tried to combine all three, and
having talked with math teachers, old
school revolutionaries, 1 ropicana dancers,
jazz piano stars, and the average, young,
energetic, smiling, good-natured, full-of
laughter Cubans, we would like to offer
some fads and a new perspective regard
ing Jason Rheins' opinion ("A new view on
Elian Oonzalez," April 27) and the
responses it has received from liana
Murillo ("Rhetoric surrounding Elian typ
ical and skewed" May 2) and Lisa (]hen ("A
new perspective on Elian," May 1).
Before delving into the notes from our
travels in Cuba, some statistics should
accompany us on our journey: within Litin
America, Cuba has the lowest infant moral
ity rate, best access to safe water, second

highest adult literacy rate and mean years of
schooling, highest performance on stan
dardized tests, highest life-expectancy,
highest ratio of doctors per capita and high
est daily calorie supply (for 1988-1990).
Not a "normal" country? True. It has
chosen a different path, challenging U.S.
influence — something admired by the
countries behind them on so many of
those statistics — and, in the process, Cuba
has arguably suffered fewer human rights
violations than Chile, a country the United
States has publicly acclaimed for its eco
nomic "transformation" during the era of
Pinochet. Cuba has the respect of many
nations, as reflected in the recent vote by
the United Nations concerning the U.S.
embargo. The vote was 149 to 2, Israel and
the United States being the only countries
in favor.
Cuba does have serious problems: civil
rights are limited, free speech is not offi
cially sanctioned, and you can go to any
human rights Web page and see a long list
of crimes. Of course, you could also check
out the same reports on the United States
and you might start wondering about our
own freedom, but Murillo has done a
more than adequate job with this point.
Rheins states that, "The wealth pro
duced in a capitalist country ... virtually
ensures a well being for citizens that is vast
ly better than can be expected in a social
ized country." It is very true that Elian will
not have the same comforts and luxuries
that he would be given here in the United
States. He will not have Nintendo or Fritos
or even the same quantities of milk and
meat, and he will not have such extensive
freedom of speech.
Considering the caloric intake statistic,
however, you would get the same impres
sion that we had sitting around Cuban din
ner tables: Cubans eat well enough, espe
cially the children. It is true that since 1990
many Cubans have been losing weight as
they have suffered economic depression in
the wake of the collapse of the Soviet
Union, yet their kids continue to Ix* well
cared for and well led.
Upon his return to Cuba, Elian would
find a culture far less focused on material
gain, a society where family and friends
take precedence, where culture does not
equal individualism and productivity. He
would grow up healthy and well educated.
Having lived and studied in Havana,
we find Rheins' comment that Cuba is a
"slave state"a gross distortion of the cur
rent state of the island. The comment that
F.lian will "enter a hard labor and indoctri

nation camp at the age of 11" and the con
clusion that upon his possible return he
"will live as a slave or Ik* murdered by Cas
tro's government" were bordering on the
ridiculous.
We have met and interacted with c hil
dren in Cuba, and they live quite free lives.
They go to school and play with friends —
none of which accords with the unfounded
claims of child labor camps and state-spon
sored homicide. The fact of the matter is
that there are no "enslavement and indoc
trination camps" for children and a child
hood in Cuba does not in the least resem
ble what we think of as slavery.
In Lisa Chen's response, we were
intrigued by the statement that it "may be
in the best interests of a child from South
Central Los Angeles to grow up in Palo
Alto," but we would like to avoid the dras
tic error of comparing South Central to
Cuba and Palo Alto to the United States.
One might argue that Palo Alto and
South Central, both in the U.S., are two
sides of the same coin, not that it is fair to
portray South Central as the city of pover
ty and gangs and Palo Alto as that of
wealth and up-right citizens, but that
seems to be the juxtaposition suggested.
Considering the analogy to Cuba, I
have never heard of a drive-by in Havana
nor ever seen a homeless person on the
street in any urban or rural area. There
are poor people who hang out in the street
during the day, but they are not Vietnam
vets ignored by society or high-school
dropouts unable to learn in overcrowded,
dangerous schools, but rather they are all
well-educated and can go to the hospital to
receive top-quality attention whenever ill.
Moreover, when you ask them what
they think about the government, they will
often tell you they think it stinks. When I
asked them to rank their problems, Fidel
usually came in a tie with the U.S. embar
go for the number one spot. Though
Cubans did achieve 5 percent growth in
1999 according to the World Bank, they
would be living much better lives without
the U.S. government's horrendous policy
toward them. Some law-makers and citi
zens of the United Suites may wish that
Cuba were more like South Central and
that the United States were an idyllic
nationwide Palo Alto, but the wish is in
vain on both counts.
What we saw and heard is only one part
of the picture, and it is true that we had
dollars and we were foreigners who could
leave at any time, but the rights that we
enjoyed are slowly being extended to more

of the country. A slow process of heafthy,
marginal change is underway that **ill
allow Cuba, hopefully, to retain the
that it has achieved in the last four decades,
but also bring in the benefits ol'more polit
ical freedom and market efficiency.
Reforms are already underway in Cuba
to extend the small market economy,-and
free local elections art* allowing for more
participation from opposition candidates.
The efforts at expanding political freedom
might also be further underway if it were
not for the U.S.'s policy which exacerbates
the government's centralization of political
authority.
So, legal arguments aside and some}
propaganda debunked, where would
Elian live better? We both can say we felt
safer walking around the streets of Santia-r
go de Cuba, Havana and Varadero at 3
a.m. than we would around any street in
South Central or Palo Alto.
In the Cuban night, you could probably
even find in a stranger a friendly face that
would invite you to dance a little rumba ill
the street or share a bottle of ruin and talk
about Ernest Hemingway. But please do
not let ideals cloud your own answer to this
question. Read some books written on the
subject, travel there, talk with people who
have traveled there.
In fact, we would like to invite our
friend Jason to a discussion of the issue of
Elian and U.S.-Cuban relations. Please feel
free to write us at larisas@stanford.edu
and klenipn@stanford.edu. Informed dia
logue will offer one of the best paths to
understanding Cuba.

Asian scholars program deserves
continued support
1 read with great disappointment Fri
day's article, "Inadequate funds doom
Asian scholars program." The cancellation
of this program is all the more unfortunate
because the scholars involved clearly value
their education much more than their
stipends and are willing to do without the
latter to achieve the goal of encouraging
greater leadership among students from
the Asia-Pacific region.
It is my belief that Stanford has the
potential to become a center for Asian and
Asian-American studies and research. Its
position in the Bay Area gives it access to
an enormous wealth, not only of cultures,
but also of educated people as well. The
booming growth of Asia, both the Pacific
Rim region and South Asia, offers oppor
tunities that Stanford, with its position in
Silicon Valley, is uniquely poised to take
advantage of.
Unfortunately, the University has con
sistently chosen not to do so and, as a
result, I believe that Stanford's approach
to Asian and Asian-American studies has
been less than ideal, especially when com
pared with other universities, such as those
in the UC system.
I strongly urge that this program not be
discontinued, and that the efforts to advo
cate and improve Asian and Asian-Ameri

can studies at the University be redoubled
among faculty, students, and the adminis
tration. Without strong studies in this area,
Stanford may no longer be perceived as
being up to date with the scholarly issues
and academic problems that we face at the
beginning of the 21st century.

Give to class gift, not Alumni Association
1 his is an open letter to all Stanford stu
dents from the Secretary of the Class of
1937. 1 am not a grouch, I support Stan
ford with all my heart. I love Gerhard, the
Band, the faculty, the campus, the stu
dents and our teams! My class lias con
tributed to the Stanford Annual Fund at a
rate of over 90 percent for three years and
will for the few years we still have. I have
led our reunions for (>() years.
I have had close dealings with the
Office Of Development and the Alumni
Association for years. I have supported
Stanford every year since graduation and
have given one gift of over one half of my
wife Jetty's (Class of 1957) and my net
worth. I believe that the friends I made at
Stanford since my freshman year in 1933
are the greatest source of pleasure in my
happy life.

You students are going to be the van
guard of a new Stanford Spirit that is jusi
being introduced. You will elect class offi
cers before graduation and you will be
taught how to organize your classes for the
rest of your lives. You will be given respon
sibilities to keep your class alive and having
fun together, run your own reunions and
be in competition with all the Stanford
classes for highest annual giving to The
Stanford Annual Fund.
Seniors, please give to the "class gift"
and give a little next year and the next.
But do not "join" the Alumni Associa
tion. Save that money for your clasjs
treasury that will build over the yeai>
for your class to use as it sees fit. SAA
says you will have a "life subscription" to
the alumni magazine. That is false!
Every graduate gets it now. There is n(>
place at Stanford for two classes <tf
alumni, privileged and not. Fell SAA
President Bill Stone loud and clear that
your membership is in your class and ;us
an alumnus the same as everyone else.
At another time I will give my opinions
of the confusing manner of accounting fin
(lit* Stanford Annual Fund. It is not well
done!

University should strike balance between
community and student relations
The recent controversy over the use of
the Stanford Foothills will cause me to look
back at my final year at and the future of
Stanford with sadness. Using a well known
strategy of embracing the protester's agen
da and using it against them, the Universi
ty cited environmental reasons for the
Foothills' use restrictions.

lacked such lofty environmental concerns

make room for additional suburban cam
