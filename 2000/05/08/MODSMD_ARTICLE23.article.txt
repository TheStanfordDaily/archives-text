Asian scholars program deserves
continued support
1 read with great disappointment Fri
day's article, "Inadequate funds doom
Asian scholars program." The cancellation
of this program is all the more unfortunate
because the scholars involved clearly value
their education much more than their
stipends and are willing to do without the
latter to achieve the goal of encouraging
greater leadership among students from
the Asia-Pacific region.
It is my belief that Stanford has the
potential to become a center for Asian and
Asian-American studies and research. Its
position in the Bay Area gives it access to
an enormous wealth, not only of cultures,
but also of educated people as well. The
booming growth of Asia, both the Pacific
Rim region and South Asia, offers oppor
tunities that Stanford, with its position in
Silicon Valley, is uniquely poised to take
advantage of.
Unfortunately, the University has con
sistently chosen not to do so and, as a
result, I believe that Stanford's approach
to Asian and Asian-American studies has
been less than ideal, especially when com
pared with other universities, such as those
in the UC system.
I strongly urge that this program not be
discontinued, and that the efforts to advo
cate and improve Asian and Asian-Ameri

can studies at the University be redoubled
among faculty, students, and the adminis
tration. Without strong studies in this area,
Stanford may no longer be perceived as
being up to date with the scholarly issues
and academic problems that we face at the
beginning of the 21st century.

Give to class gift, not Alumni Association
1 his is an open letter to all Stanford stu
dents from the Secretary of the Class of
1937. 1 am not a grouch, I support Stan
ford with all my heart. I love Gerhard, the
Band, the faculty, the campus, the stu
dents and our teams! My class lias con
tributed to the Stanford Annual Fund at a
rate of over 90 percent for three years and
will for the few years we still have. I have
led our reunions for (>() years.
I have had close dealings with the
Office Of Development and the Alumni
Association for years. I have supported
Stanford every year since graduation and
have given one gift of over one half of my
wife Jetty's (Class of 1957) and my net
worth. I believe that the friends I made at
Stanford since my freshman year in 1933
are the greatest source of pleasure in my
happy life.

You students are going to be the van
guard of a new Stanford Spirit that is jusi
being introduced. You will elect class offi
cers before graduation and you will be
taught how to organize your classes for the
rest of your lives. You will be given respon
sibilities to keep your class alive and having
fun together, run your own reunions and
be in competition with all the Stanford
classes for highest annual giving to The
Stanford Annual Fund.
Seniors, please give to the "class gift"
and give a little next year and the next.
But do not "join" the Alumni Associa
tion. Save that money for your clasjs
treasury that will build over the yeai>
for your class to use as it sees fit. SAA
says you will have a "life subscription" to
the alumni magazine. That is false!
Every graduate gets it now. There is n(>
place at Stanford for two classes <tf
alumni, privileged and not. Fell SAA
President Bill Stone loud and clear that
your membership is in your class and ;us
an alumnus the same as everyone else.
At another time I will give my opinions
of the confusing manner of accounting fin
(lit* Stanford Annual Fund. It is not well
done!
