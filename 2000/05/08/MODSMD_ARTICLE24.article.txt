SAN DILCO, (-alii. — Adapting and making the
transition to underclassmen leadership on the field was
a key element ol Stanford's success in claiming the
\\ \\ 1 .1. championship for the third year in a row. I'll is
season, injuries have placed integral uppcrc lassmen
players snc h as senior I lech Born and junior Katharine
Barnes on the bench, leaving big shoes to fill.
1 ve been forced to ask main of our freshmen and
sophomores to play new roles and fill the unexpected
holes that this yeai has br<night, said head coach I leidi
(loimor. "()nr younger plavet s have clone so with in
credible p< )ise and confidence."
lout outstanding sophomores, Li/ Britt, Caroline
Osterwise, Jenny Silverman and Kmilv Rodriguez,
epitomi/e the type of dedication and spirit that (lonnor
has so highh praised.
" I eamwork was one of the key contributions to our
win todav, and a lot of that has to do with the sopho
mores. I hev have gelled not only as a class, but asa uni
fier of the team as a whole," said senior co-captain
Christina (iilvutin.
I'he loss of Born caused a major shift in the line-up,
plac ing Brill ai I lie p< >sition ol first home, closest to the
opponent's gc>al.
"Li/ lias been a solid starter all season, but this week
end she reallv proved her talent and did an amazing
jol) running and calling the plays and making assists
from behind the goal," Born said.
In Saturday's game against I'CIA, Britt led the of-
fense with nine shots on goal, three
scores, one forced turnover and one
ground ball recovery. She was also a
contributor in Sunday's win with
one goal and an assist to sophomore
Sara Lev, another key offender.
"Liz's game has continued to im
prove throughout the season. She
lias really stepped up to the chal
lenge of playing first home," Con
nor said. "She was crafty behind the
goal this weekend and remained
poised and at ease."
The Britt-Osterwise connection
was in full effect throughout the
Final Four games. Playing attack
wing and third home, Osterwise re
pealed her performance as a force
against her opponent. With five
shots on goal, two goals, and key
turnovers, she was instrumental in
Stanford's offensive domination of
Saturday's game.
"Caroline is our quiet, deter
mined offensive leader. I always ex
pect her to play with all the energy
and intensity that she has. This
weekend was no exception," Con
nor said. "She went out on the field
wanting to win and to Ik- a team
player every minute of the game."
In the finals, Osterwise scored
Stanford's tying goal of the first half
after Lev's initial goal. She then as
sisted two perfectly executed shots
by Sunday's superstar, freshman
Liz Ixinese, and finished the first
half with an assisted goal from Brit t
to the bottom left corner of the net.
Silverman and Rodriguez are a
defensive duo whose tactical and
mental connections are always in

i •
tandem. They both play defensive
wing, a position that must cover tKe
entire field.

ground balls. V.v
"Emily is speedy. We alwatslifiVe
her cover the opposition's fastest
player and she never lets down,"
Connor said.
Her D-wing counterpart, Silver
man, scored two of the Cardinal
goals on Saturday and one goal on
Sunday, forced two turnovers
throughout the weekend and con
tinuously captured key ground
balls to return the possession to
Stanford's offense.
Silverman's defense in Sunday's
game displayed instances of incred
ible covering as well. As she faced
one of Davis' top players, Sarah
Breyer, she rarely let a shot leave
Breyer's stick.
"Jenny is the most talented ath
lete I've ever seen. She has incredi
ble instinct and is so tough. 1 always
put her on the best attacker of our
opposition," Connor said.
The teamwork, cohesiveness
and energy that these four out
standing sophomores brought to
the field this weekend was conta
gious for other members of their
class as well. Lex's weekend was
filled with tremendous goals and of
fensive assists while co-sophomore
I'atti Zettler stepped up the defen
sive intensity from the backfield.
"I'm confident as 1 look to the
coming years of this team," Born
said. "The way the underclassmen
performed his weekend was awe
some and they are only going to get
better."
