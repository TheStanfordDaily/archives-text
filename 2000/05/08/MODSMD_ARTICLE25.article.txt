SAN DIEGO, Calif. — It was fitting that
the song, "Another one bites the dust"
echoed through the stadium at UC-San
Diego as the Stanford women's lacrosse
team took the field in its last ever Western
Women's Lacrosse League Championship.
And two more teams did bite the dust, as
Stanford defeated both UCLA and UC-
Davis en route to the VVWLL Champi
onship title.
After defeating the Bruins 13-9, the Car
dinal moved on to face Davis, the No. 1 seed
from the North.
Freshman Liz. Lanese scored a remark
able six goals for Stanford in its 12-9 over
Davis. After sitting out Saturday's semifinal
game against UCLA with a stress-fracture in
her left foot, Lanese returned to play in full
force against the Aggies.
Due to the outstanding performance of
Lanese and the solid efforts of the Stanford
defense, the Cardinal can rightfully claim
its title as the "best in the West."
"1 am so proud of everyone today. In
particular, I am so proud of the freshmen
and sophomore classes who really stepped
up when we needed them . . . especially
Liz," said senior co-captain Christina Gi
lyutin.

the Lacrosse NCAA Final Four for west
coast teams. Stanford's win yesterday
brings its record to three championships in
three years, demonstrating its dominance

of West Coast lacrosse.
