### LORI MAUND BROOKE MORRILL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
SAN DIEGO, Calif. — It was fitting that
the song, "Another one bites the dust"
echoed through the stadium at UC-San
Diego as the Stanford women's lacrosse
team took the field in its last ever Western
Women's Lacrosse League Championship.
And two more teams did bite the dust, as
Stanford defeated both UCLA and UC-
Davis en route to the VVWLL Champi
onship title.
After defeating the Bruins 13-9, the Car
dinal moved on to face Davis, the No. 1 seed
from the North.
Freshman Liz. Lanese scored a remark
able six goals for Stanford in its 12-9 over
Davis. After sitting out Saturday's semifinal
game against UCLA with a stress-fracture in
her left foot, Lanese returned to play in full
force against the Aggies.
Due to the outstanding performance of
Lanese and the solid efforts of the Stanford
defense, the Cardinal can rightfully claim
its title as the "best in the West."
"1 am so proud of everyone today. In
particular, I am so proud of the freshmen
and sophomore classes who really stepped
up when we needed them . . . especially
Liz," said senior co-captain Christina Gi
lyutin.
The WWLL Final Four is equivalent to
the Lacrosse NCAA Final Four for west
coast teams. Stanford's win yesterday
brings its record to three championships in
three years, demonstrating its dominance

of West Coast lacrosse.
This winning record is especially mean
ingful as the Cardinal prepares to play an
independent schedule next vear, wuh.llje
ultimate goal of qualifying foi the JK'AA
tournament.

Sophomore Caroline Osterwise leads the Cardinal attack against UCLA on
Saturday. Osterwise was a key component in Stanford's championship run.
That's when the Cardinal
turned up the heat.
"There have been times like
this in the past where we did let
up, but we didn't do that todav."
Gilyutin said. "We were the more
skilled team. It came clown to who
wanted it more, and we did. We
just kept lighting and didn't let
them back into the game."
Stanford rebounded from the
deficit to score live consecutive
goals and take the lead by a mar
gin of 5-2. Lanese led Stanford's
retaliation with three goals, two of
them assisted by sophomore Car
oline Osterwise. Osterwise and
sophomore Sara I.e\ also con
tributed with a pair of back to back
penalty shots.
Freshman Lauren Dietrich
made a subtle but significant im
pact on the Cardinal's attack. A
large part of the scoring for both
teams was largely determined by
each team's ball possessions, and
Dietrich tenaciously nabbed eight
draws for the Cardinal.

mined attitude and mental com
posure facilitated its fight from be
hind, Davis' approach seemed to
cripple its own comeback attempt.

Davis' offense relied heavily on
last break counter-attacks and
emotionally driven individual ef
forts at the goal. As the goal mar
gin widened, the Aggies reverted
to rough physical plav, drawing
six yellow card penalties through
out ilk- course of the game.
"We stayed more composed.
[The Aggies] seemed to get realh
frustrated. 1 iliink that all the Ibuls
