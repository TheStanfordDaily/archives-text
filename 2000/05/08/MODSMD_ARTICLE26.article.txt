INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. â€”
Courage, heart and pride. Three
characteristics the Stanford
women's water polo team showed
in its final game for its 2000 sea
son at the National Champi
onship Tournament, in Indian

polsis, Ind. Alter a devastating
semifinal loss to (JSC on Satur
day. the Cardinal rallied to beat its
bay area rival, C >alilornia, 8-5 fora
third place finish.
On Saturday the water polo
nation was shocked when the top
two teams, Stanford and Cal,
were upset in the day's semifinal
games by No. 4 USC and No. 3

UCLA, respectively. UCLA later
went on to beat USC I 1-4 in Sun
day's championship game to take
home the national title.
Against the Golden Bears,
Stanford scored the first goal
from a wing shot by freshman
Julie Gardner and never looked
back. The Cardinal was up 4-2 by
the end of the first half and 6-4 by
the end of the third. In the final
quarter, sophomore Kate Pettit
gave Gardner a perfect inside as
sist fora quick goal.
One minute later, Gardner re
turned the favor by assisting
sophomore Margie Dingeldein
for the game's final score.
"I'm proud of the amount of
heart we showed after coming off
of such a disappointing loss," said
junior co-captain I lilary Gallogly.
" This game was based on pride.
Through our performance we
showed pride for everything
we've done this year and for the
pride we feel for each other."
The Cardinal players and
coaches agree that playing for
third the day after an emotional
loss is one of the hardest things a
team has to do.
"It is easy to allow yourself to
be overwhelmed by disappoint
ment," said head coach John
Tanner. "But it requires incredi
ble strength to come back twen
ty-four hours later and play
well."

Gardner and Dingeldein each
scored three goals against the
Bears. Juniors Anne-Marie
Keenan and Dani Bell each put
away three.
"Against Cal we played the
kind of game that we wanted to
play all along," Pettit said. "I'm
proud of that."
On Friday, Stanford defeated
Harvard 17-3 and Princeton 17-7
which qualified the Cardinal for
the semifinal game. But USC
proved to be too much.
The Cardinal put up an early
fight against USC, only to he later
overwhelmed by the Trojans' out
side shooting. Physical play and
disputed calls led to live Cardinal
ejections in the first half, giving
the Trojans five man-up posses
sions, resulting in a 5-2 lead at half
time.
By the second half, the Cardi
nal lost its momentum while USC
pushed forward resulting in the
l rojan's 10-5 victory.
Keenan led the Cardinal scor
ing with three goals. Juniors Hi
lary Gallogly and Kelly Shouey
each notched one.
"In our USC game we lacked
tlie balance of poise, passion and
composure," Tanner said. "While
Saturday's loss was hard, it in no
way diminishes the hard work
