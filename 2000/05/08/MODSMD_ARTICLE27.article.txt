# Women hold heads high despite loss
## 
### 
For the Stanford women's water polo
team, everything comes back to
friends and family. After a heart
breaking semifinal lost to USC and a
bittersweet victory over California to earn a
third-place national finish, the team gathered
with family and friends in a small Italian
restaurant to celebrate each others' company.
Since September, Stanford has focused on
its growth and performance with the ultimate
goal of winning the national title. The team
members have shown their dedication time
and again by getting up at a.m. for morn-

ing practices, through in
tense conditioning work
outs, weight lifting pro
grams and countless white
board talks.
Such sacrifice and com
mitment, especially at a
university as academically
challenging as Stanford, is
admirable. Even more ad-

mirable is the closeness within the team.
The game of water polo combines the
physical and emotional demands ot'anv sport

with the added element of water. In addition
to having to run specific offensive pla\ s. being
aware of surrounding teammates and pro
tecting the goal on defense, plavers must also
deal with all characteristics associated with
drowning. I'liey walk awav from games with
black eyes, bruises and torn suits.
At the national tournament, the plaxers
and fans are emotionalh ( barged, and the
games are even more ph\ sic alt ban usual.
The fast-paced, almost chaotic environ-

No other team has better team
chemistry than that of the Stanford
women's water polo team. Stan
ford has a closer resemblance to a
family than a team.
The players consider them
selves friends first and teammates
second. They have a closeness that
helps them win games and a close
ness that helps them survive the
losses.
The closeness of the team ex
tends to a closeness amongst play
ers' families. Every person on the
team had family members fly
across the country to Indiana in
order to give love and support to
their daughters. That support
was critical this weekend, as Stan
ford had to rebound from their
semifinal loss to face longtime
rival California in the third place
game. Both teams were disap

pointed with their losses from the
day before; for both teams, the
third place game was played for
pride.
Stanford played a dynamic, ex
citing game to wrap up their sea
son. It was obvious that they were
no longer playing fora national
title, but instead for themselves,
and for the tight-knit community
they have been building all season
long.
Indianapolis is a very sports
centered city. The crosswalks are
painted with basketball plays and
Pacers banners hang from hotels,
corporate builds and restaurants.
The NCAA museum at one end of
the city highlights college sports
teams. Stanford's name appears
frequently throughout the dis
plays.
()neof the most captivating dis
plays is a video that asks "what is a
champion?" It questions whether a
champion is merely the one who
wins, and whether or not a cham
pion can exist in the face of defeat.
This year Stanford failed to
reach its long sought after goal of
being national champions. Despite
its failure, Stanford women's water
polo is still one of the luckiest teams
in the world of sports.
