and a couple of world-class spills.
Paced through the first quarter-mile in 50.5 sec
onds, Jennings passed the half-mile mark in a brisk
1:57 in a four-man pack which included redshirt ju
nior Michael Stember. The pace only seemed to
quicken from there.
With 400 meters to go, Jennings still looked fresh.
Darting for the lead with 300 meters remaining, Jen
nings moved past Jason Pyrahand never looked back.
Completing his final circuit in just over 55 seconds,
Jennings logged the fastest time run by an American
this year and a new Stanford sclhx>l record.
Stember crossed in third at 3:40.54, a season-best
and just .04 seconds from the I Vials standard. Fresh
man Andrew Powell, rat ing in a different heat, quali

Cardinal to hit the Olympic standard would be Brad
Hauser. In fact, with 400 meters remaining, Hauser
pushed for the lead and appeared as though he might
win the race.
But lightning struck twice. Trying to scoot by
Reebok's Pete Sherry with 350 to go, Brad Hauser's
legs got tangled with Sherry's causing both to go
down.
I lauser didn't give in. Though the leaders had
taken oil , Hauser gathered himself and c losed with a
65-second final lap, finishing sixth in 13:29.71.
Though he narrowly missed the Olympic standard,
1 lauser's mark was both an N( AAautomatic qualifier
and a new school record, bettering his own 13:35.78
set in 1998.
Riley nabbed an NCAA auto and Olympic Trials
qualifier at 13:42.96, and Brent Hauser did the same
with his 13:45.54. Reebok's Matt C iuisto took top hon
ors at 13:25.95.
In the 10,000-meter run, junior Fhomas Murley
and freshman Louis Luchini qualified automatically
for the NCAAs at 28:53.70 and 28:54.30, respectively.
Fhe Stanford women were productive as well, even

meet. Senior Sally Clynn notched a provisional NCAA
qualifier, finishing second in the 3,000 meters at
9:24.80. Freshman Lyndsay Hyatt did the same in the
800, finishing in 2:05.64.
