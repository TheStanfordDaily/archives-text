## 
### BECKY BLANCHARD EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford men's and women's track and field
teams took tired legs into Saturday's Big Meet.
Dog-tired.
Yet both teams pulled out gutsy performances, nar
rowly losing to California after less than a day's rest
from Friday night's Cardinal Invitational. The Cal
women sewed up the victory after 17 events, winning
83 2/3-79 1/3. l iie men's battle came down to a nail
biting 1,600-meter relay showdown, with the Bears fi
nally besting the Cardinal on the final cui veto earn the
84-79 team victory.
The men's competition stayed close throughout
the day. The two teams traded punches with each
event, setting up the relay dual to decide the meet's
outcome. With the score tied at 79 going into the final
event, tensions ran high in the crowd and on the field.
Sophomore sprinter Evan Kelty gave the Cardinal
an early lead in the first lap, putting junior Ryan Car
roll in good position to cut in ahead of Cal's second
runner. Carroll was able to maintain the edge for Stan
ford, and when lie passed the baton to junior Michael
Stember, it seemed that the Cardinal would toll to vic
tory. Stenibershot out early but was unable to fend off
(ial on the homestretch, giving the Bears the lead.
Sophomore Mark Hassell, a 400-meter specialist,
worked to regain position, but was unable to catch
Cal's Chuck Berkeley, who taunted Stanford athletes
gathered around the final curve by holding out the
baton to them as he passed. Cal out-muscled the Car
dinal in the end, winning in a time of 3 minutes, 14.52
seconds. Stanford followed in 3:15.47.
The big finale was set up by solid performances all
around from a number of Stanford athletes. On the
track, juniors Michael 11 arte and David Abril were
first-place finishers for the Cardinal. Harte won the
110-meter hurdles in 14.60. Abril ran a Pacific 10 qual
ifying time of 9:07.24 to win the 3,000-meter steeple
chase. In the sprints, junior Leroy Sims ran 10.65 to
place second in the 100 meter.

Stanford was dominant in the distance and middle
distance races, sweeping the 800 and 5,000-meter
races. Fresh off the Cardinal Invitational, sophomore
Gabejennings led the Stanford charge in the 800. Jen
nings cruised to the finish in 1:49.91.
In the 1,500, Stember came from behind to steal
the win from Cal distance star Bolota Asmerom in
3:46.95. The Cardinal, paced for four laps by seniors
Brad and Brent Mauser, claimed the top five placed in
the 5,000 meter. Senior Jason Balkman earned the
victory in 14:21.98.
Junior Todd Beyerlein, senior Toby Stevenson and
freshman Omer I nan highlighted field competition.
Beyerlein won the high jump with a leap of 6 feet, 11
3/4 inches, just under his personal best, 7-0 1/4.
