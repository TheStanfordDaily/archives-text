# Exposure to hepatitis in dining halls possible
## 
### MARIANNA STACEY LOPEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Wilbur, Florence Moore and Lagunita Dining 112 falls may have unknowing
ly served students a batch of strawberries contaminated with the Hepatitis A
virus. Thus far, no illnesses can be traced to exposure to the strawberries.
It is believed that the dining halls received a shipment of fro/en, sliced straw
berries since linked to an outbreak of 112 iepatitis A cases in Massachusetts. The
strawberries may have been served as a topping for waflles, yogurt and ice
c ream between April 21 and April 28.
Responding to a nationwide recall, on April 2K Housing and Dining Ser
vices officials removed all of the possibly contaminated strawberries from ser
vice and returned them to the distributor.
In a meeting with students held last night, Rati Teherian, associate director
and executive chef for Dining Services, said Dining Services initially sent back
five buckets of strawberries to the distributor. But he estimated that only half a
bucket — about IT) pounds — was actually used in the dining halls.
"We removed all the products in all the dining services ac ross campus, basi
cally anything that looked red," said Teherian.
Hut he said that later lie learned from the distributor of the strawberries,
Si sco Distributing, that there may have been more than five buckets of conta
minated strawberries. Teherian called Sisco "the most respectable food dis
tributor in Americ a'" and said Dining Services relied heavily on them for infor
mation.
He said that after consulting with Cowell Student I lealth Service, dining of
ficials decided late Friday night and early Saturday morning to notify students
about the possible hepatitus exposure.
Dr. Ira M. Friedman, director of Cowell Student Health Service, said that
"given the ambiguity of the situation, in which we are not at all sure if any po

tentially contaminated food was served, we are providing information in a bal
anced and calm way and giving students opportunities to have questions an
swered, in person and over the phone."
"VVe shared the information as soon as we felt it was prudent to do so," said
Friedman. I fe said at the meeting that notices will be placed in Flo Mo, l.agu
nita and Wilbur tomorrow morning.

But some students expressed
concern that the University hasn't
done enough to inform students
of the possible exposure.
"It's pretty scary because you
don't think that anything like that
could happen at Flo Mo. It's pret
ty dismaying that no one told us as
soon as they knew," said freshman
Casey Brazeal.
Friedman said that from the
first notification of the recall on
April 28, Dining Services worked
with the Santa Clara County
Health Department's environ
mental health inspectors to deter
mine if contaminated products
were received by Dining Services
and, if they were received, the
amount and location of the straw
berries.
Students who have been poten
tially exposed to Hepatitis A
should take extra hygienic pre
cautions during the 50-day incu
bation period. Friedman has ad
vised students to pay special atten
tion for signs fatigue, loss of ap
petite, vomiting, stomach aches
and jaundice, all symptoms of He
patitis A.
Some students said they felt
that the potential exposure re
flected poorly on the dining halls.
"I think that it's embarrassing
for University Dining Services.
Thousands of students depend on
them for food and it's embarrass
ing that they're serving food in
that condition," said sophomore
Scott Silverglate.
Hepatitis A is distinguished
from its counterparts Hepatitis B
and C, which may have more seri
ous implications. Hepatitis A is a

viral disease of the liver, which can
be serious, hut rarely lesults in
complications or death.
Fhe virus can be passed from
one person to another through in
fected stool, and is most common
ly spread through loods or eating
utensils that have been handled
by an infected person who has not
washed their hands carefulh after
using the restroom.
After recovering from the
virus, people remain immune to
the infection and no trace ol the
virus remains in the body. People
do not become carriers of the He
patitis A virus.
Students are asked to consider
obtaining an immunoglobulin
(1C) injection. 1(. is thought to
lessen the symptoms of those in
fected with Hepatitis A, provided
that the injection is attained with
in 1 4 days of the exposing. Symp
toms may not make themselves
known for up to two weeks after
exposure, so students tnav not
want to wait for symptoms to ap
pear before attaining the I( > injei -
tion. The injection is unnecessary
for those already immunized
against I lepatitis A.
Cowell Student Health Ser
vices will have free IC injections
available on a walk-in basis begin
ning today. Students are encour
aged to ( all Cowell with am ques
tions they may have pertaining to
the illness.
I his is not the first brush Din-!
ing Services has had with the
virus.
"There was a cluster of I lep A
cases two years ago. An individual
spread hepatitus before winter
break. I Ie was a food handler in
Casa Italiana," explained Fried
man at the meeting.
