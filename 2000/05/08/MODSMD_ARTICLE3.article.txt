### MARIANNA STACEY LOPEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Wilbur, Florence Moore and Lagunita Dining 112 falls may have unknowing
ly served students a batch of strawberries contaminated with the Hepatitis A
virus. Thus far, no illnesses can be traced to exposure to the strawberries.
It is believed that the dining halls received a shipment of fro/en, sliced straw
berries since linked to an outbreak of 112 iepatitis A cases in Massachusetts. The
strawberries may have been served as a topping for waflles, yogurt and ice
c ream between April 21 and April 28.
Responding to a nationwide recall, on April 2K Housing and Dining Ser
vices officials removed all of the possibly contaminated strawberries from ser
vice and returned them to the distributor.
In a meeting with students held last night, Rati Teherian, associate director
and executive chef for Dining Services, said Dining Services initially sent back
five buckets of strawberries to the distributor. But he estimated that only half a
bucket — about IT) pounds — was actually used in the dining halls.
"We removed all the products in all the dining services ac ross campus, basi
cally anything that looked red," said Teherian.
Hut he said that later lie learned from the distributor of the strawberries,
Si sco Distributing, that there may have been more than five buckets of conta
minated strawberries. Teherian called Sisco "the most respectable food dis
tributor in Americ a'" and said Dining Services relied heavily on them for infor
mation.
He said that after consulting with Cowell Student I lealth Service, dining of
ficials decided late Friday night and early Saturday morning to notify students
about the possible hepatitus exposure.
Dr. Ira M. Friedman, director of Cowell Student Health Service, said that
"given the ambiguity of the situation, in which we are not at all sure if any po

tentially contaminated food was served, we are providing information in a bal
anced and calm way and giving students opportunities to have questions an
swered, in person and over the phone."
"VVe shared the information as soon as we felt it was prudent to do so," said
Friedman. I fe said at the meeting that notices will be placed in Flo Mo, l.agu
nita and Wilbur tomorrow morning.
