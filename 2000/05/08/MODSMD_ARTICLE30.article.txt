President-elect John Hen
nessey and the rest of campus are
awaiting the Provost Search Com
mittee's recommendation to fill the
University's number two position.
After an organizational meeting
last Wednesday, the seven-mem
ber committee outlined the basic
criteria for the new provost and a
plan of action to narrow down the
candidates.
"We're looking for someone
who's brilliant, understanding,
well-respected, has good judg
ment [and] will work well with
John [Hennessey]," said Physics
Prof. Steve Chu, a member of the
committee.
" 1 he most important thing is to
have someone with stellar academ
ic credentials," added Geophysics
Prof. Mark Zoback, another com
mittee member. "We want some
one who understands academia,
who understands the [faculty] ap
pointment process extremely well
and the procedures that Stanford

has to maintain its academic excel
lence."
Senior Brian Schmidt, the only
undergraduate on the committee,
described the comprehensive
process the committee will use to
narrow down the candidates.
The candidates are nominated
by members of the Stanford com
munity, including students, faculty
and staff. The committee will dis
cuss the qualifications of each can
didate and decide whether to rec
ommend that candidate for the
position. At the end of the process
the committee will recommend
five or six people to I lennessy, who
will then make the final decision,
possibly based on a round of inter
views.
The committee is considering
candidates both inside and outside
the Stanford community, although
Chu said the committee's consider
ations are "heavily weighted to
wards people in Stanford."
According to Schmidt , the nom
ination process is only being adver
tised in Stanford, so the likelihood
of an external nomination is low,
but the committee will consider
every nomination it receives.
Although in an earlier interview
Hennessey emphasized (lie re
sponsibilities of the provost's job as
chief financial officer, the commit
tee is not limiting its scope to c an
didates familiar with Stanford's fi
nances.

"Certainly whoever is provost
has key fiscal responsibilites,"
Zoback said. " That doesn't neces
sarily translate into having - fiscal
experience .... Whoever gets job
will have experience in some areas
and not some in others. You can't
use experience in all areas as a nec
essary prerequisite."
Sociology Prof. Karen (look, a
committee member, said that it is
still too early in the process to tell

solicit undergraduates' opinions
about the search process and to
give students an opportunity to
voice their concerns about the role
of the provost. The first forum will
be today from 9 p.m. to 1 1 p.m.
and the second will be tomorrow
from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., both up
stairs in fresidder.
Nominations for provost may
be emailed to
