# 'Adventure' of a lifetime has Stanford students venturing far from the Farm

Interning at their town newspaper. Serv
ing coffee in a local restaurant. Filing fora
consulting company. For many Stanford stu
dents, summer jobs can be a bit mundane.
But some students seem to have hit on a
better idea: They serve as counselors on all
expenses paid trips with the Stanford Family
Adventures program.
Open only to Stanford alumni and their
families, the program offered a fun and edu
cational tour of Greece and Turkey during its
inaugural summer. Sierra Camp student staff
came along on the first trip in 1996 to teach
and entertain the kids while their parents ex
changed ideas with a Stanford faculty mem
ber.
Today that program has expanded and
now offers adventures for Stanford families in
five locations: the Aegean Sea, Tuscany,
Africa, Montana and Alaska. The trips last
from seven to 14 days, and cost $2,155 to $ 17,
(595 per person. These costs cover accommo
dations and study materials, as well as most
meals and activities. Airfare is separate for all
but the Africa adventure.
Though the trips are not cheap, many fam
ilies return for multiple summers. Associate
director Sarah Wolf accredited this success to
the "Young Adventurers" program, which
pairs up the kids with Sierra Camp stall (lin -
ing the vacation.
"Other schools have similar family pro

grains," Wolf said, "but none of them has the
counselor program."
Counselors are former Sierra Camp stall,
usually recent Stanford graduates, who must
apply for their positions. Hie application
process is competitive, Wolf said, and not sur
prisingly so. If selected, counselors enjoy all
expense-paid trips to one of the program's
destinations. However, they receive no pay
beyond the coverage of the trip.
The primary duty of the counselors is to
teach the kids a specified curriculum, but in a
manner that is entertaining enough to keep
young minds interested.
"We have to think of something that com
plements what the parents are doing that's
also fun lor a six-year-old," said Chris Cary, a
1998 graduate who served as a counselor on
the Tuscany trip.
"You really need to do hands-on stuff," he
added.
Cary recalls that the kids made soap sculp
tures after seeing the statue of David, and
made their own flags lor the horse race at the
I'alio, a medieval pageant.
"We taught [the ki(ls| the Creek alphabet
in a song that I think someone learned from
her sorority," said I lilary Folger, '9(5, a coun
selor for the Aegean trip.
Another successful activity, Folgei said, was
having the kids create their own Creek tem
ples.
"We talked about the various types of
columns that we would be seeing in the ruins,"

she said.
Though the counselors are really only
alone with the kids while the parents are with
Faculty Leaders learning and sharing their
own ideas, their job extends beyond these
teaching sessions. Counselors must also brain
storm and plan family activities, and generally
be responsible for keeping the group engaged.
"If there's not a lot of energy it's the coun
selors' job to infuse energy into the group and
to get them excited," Wolf said.
Occasionally there is an adults-only activity
during which the counselors must entertain
the kids.
"We did gelato-tasting while the parents
did wine-tasting," (]ary said.
It's not all fun and games, though.
"We had really long days, and that was
hard on the kids," Cary said.
"ft took a lot of creativity trying to make it
as educational as possible — but fun — or
knowing we would lose t he kids' interest," said
Molly (Griggs. '97, who accompanied the Alas
ka adventure.
But overall, the hard work seems to be
worth it. "It's pretty hard to turn down an op
portunity like ibis," said senior Angie Allen,
who will accompany the Aegean adventure
this summer, "l vcrv lime 1 tell somebody
about this job, they respond in disbelief."
"I work lor a dot-coin in the city," said Fol
ger, "and that's how I took mv two weeks' va
cation last vear. 1 hat definitely says a lot about
the program."
