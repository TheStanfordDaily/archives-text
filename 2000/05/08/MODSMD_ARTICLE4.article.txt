### KATIE HILL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Swing group Big Had Voodoo Daddy
will headline FrostFest 2000, an all-da\
music festival in Frost Amphitheater sched
uled for Sunday, May 21.
112 he event, sponsored by the Stanford
Concert Network, will feature perfor
mances by hip-hop group Souls of Mischief ,
funk rockers Crinning Idiots and the B-Side
Players, an eclectic nine-piece band that in
corporates Afro-Cuban, jazz and hip-hop el
ements in its music.
"Our goal was to create a real music festi
val," explained junior Wes Radez, assistant
director of the concert network. "It's a real
ly diverse bill with something that will ap
peal to everyone."
According to concert network director
Jonah Berger, a sophomore, "eight dollars
[the price of a student ticket] is really cheap.
"We wanted to make the price rock bot-

Tom and get people out there."
Raclez agreed. " I lie goal is to make this
an event where people c an come and hang
out all clay, bring books if they have to. We
wanted to create a really chill atmos
phere."
At one time Frost regularl) hosted con
certs, including performances In groups
such as the Grateful Dead. But in recent
years, few events have been held there.
"Frost is a great venue, a great place to
have a festival," said Berger. "We've been
thinking about this event since the begin
ning of the year, and we really wanted to use
Frost. It's really underused."
Radez said the amphitheater can accom
modate 7,700 people, adding that the con
cert network hopes the event will draw a
near-capacity crowd. "Wouldn't it be great
to hangout at Frost with ."j,oooor 6,000 peo
ple?" said Radez. Both Berger and Radez
