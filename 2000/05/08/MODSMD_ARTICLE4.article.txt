## 
### KATIE HILL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Swing group Big Had Voodoo Daddy
will headline FrostFest 2000, an all-da\
music festival in Frost Amphitheater sched
uled for Sunday, May 21.
112 he event, sponsored by the Stanford
Concert Network, will feature perfor
mances by hip-hop group Souls of Mischief ,
funk rockers Crinning Idiots and the B-Side
Players, an eclectic nine-piece band that in
corporates Afro-Cuban, jazz and hip-hop el
ements in its music.
"Our goal was to create a real music festi
val," explained junior Wes Radez, assistant
director of the concert network. "It's a real
ly diverse bill with something that will ap
peal to everyone."
According to concert network director
Jonah Berger, a sophomore, "eight dollars
[the price of a student ticket] is really cheap.
"We wanted to make the price rock bot-

Tom and get people out there."
Raclez agreed. " I lie goal is to make this
an event where people c an come and hang
out all clay, bring books if they have to. We
wanted to create a really chill atmos
phere."
At one time Frost regularl) hosted con
certs, including performances In groups
such as the Grateful Dead. But in recent
years, few events have been held there.
"Frost is a great venue, a great place to
have a festival," said Berger. "We've been
thinking about this event since the begin
ning of the year, and we really wanted to use
Frost. It's really underused."
Radez said the amphitheater can accom
modate 7,700 people, adding that the con
cert network hopes the event will draw a
near-capacity crowd. "Wouldn't it be great
to hangout at Frost with ."j,oooor 6,000 peo
ple?" said Radez. Both Berger and Radez

said they hoped the event will be
the first in an annual series of
music festivals in Frost.
Before today's announcement,
the event was kept under wraps.
However, several students on Sat
urday expressed enthusiasm
about the prospect of a concert at
Frost.
"I'm stoked. I'm really excited
about it," said senior Sundeep
Ahuja.
Sophomore Chris Lew also said
he liked the idea of a concert at
Frost. "1 wouldn't miss an event
like this. . . .I'll be first in line for
tickets."
Frost will open at 3:30 p.m. with
performances scheduled to begin
at 4:30 p.m. "This is going to be a
five-hour event â€” a full day of
music," explained Berger. Grin
ning Idiots are scheduled to play
first, followed bv Souls of Mischief ,

B-Side Players and Big liad;
Voodoo Daddy.
This event will be the largest in
a busy year for the concert net*
work. In October they brought
lap group The Roots to campus
and sponsored a performance by
rapper Sir-Mix-a-Lot at the Main
solemn party.
The group also organized a'
concert series at the Coffee
during Winter Quarter and wel
comed Big Woo to White I'la/a
earlier this quarter. Their 'most
recent event, the lower Row block
party scheduled for this past Sat
urday, was canceled due to rain.
Tickets for FrostFest 2000 will
cost $8 for Stanford students, $15
for others. Tickets can be pur-j
chased through the Stanford .tick
et office and all Bass Tickets loca
tions beginning Tuesday.
