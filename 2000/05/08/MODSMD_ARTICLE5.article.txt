Threatening the outcome of the ASSU Presiden
tial election, the first ever decision issued by the
ANSI (Constitutional (Council last night found one of
six charges tiled to he unconstitutional. However,
the actions outlined in the charge, which related to
the demerits system used to record elections viola
tions during the general elections, were found to he
in good faith by a majority of the Council, so the re
sults of the election w ill stand.
However, final outcome of the election remains
uncertain because the Council w ill meet on Tuesday
to consider the five additional charges.
I he six charges were initially filed on Wednes
day, April 2(i In five members of the Graduate Stu
dent Council. ASSU President Mike Levin joined on
two of the charges. Last week. Levin dropped his
name 112 rom the charges.
I he five members of the Council, Chair Harris
Shapiro, a doctoral student in physics, doctoral stu

the GSC never approved the demerit system.
Last night, the Council limited the charge to the
ASSI Presidential election, because demerits were
onh used in that election and not any of the others
under consideration.
Ihe respondents to this charge were ASSU
Hearings Officer Katie Young, a junior, and the
Elections Commission. Young was not present at
the hearing.
I n the course of the debate, electrical engineering
doctoral student Paul 11 art kt*, one of the (>S(. mem
bers who filed the initial complaint, said, "the un
constitutional act is the application of that rule to the
election. The Undergraduate Senate is free to pass
am rules thev so choose, but when [the demerit sys
tem | was enacted by the Elections Commission it be
came an unconstitutional act."
Elections Commissioner Jason Kang, a cotermi
nal student in economics, and members of the Un-i
dcrgraduate Senate defended the elections rules de
veloped In the Commission, based on the difficulty
in coordinating the governing documents of the Un
dergraduate Senate and the (ISC.
Senior Dan Perkel, a former elections commis
sioner, said, "It's hard to even decipher where the
constitutionality even is."

approved the penalty system governing the elec-i
