## 
### JESSICA TUCKER-MOHL EDITORIAL STAFF 
Threatening the outcome of the ASSU Presiden
tial election, the first ever decision issued by the
ANSI (Constitutional (Council last night found one of
six charges tiled to he unconstitutional. However,
the actions outlined in the charge, which related to
the demerits system used to record elections viola
tions during the general elections, were found to he
in good faith by a majority of the Council, so the re
sults of the election w ill stand.
However, final outcome of the election remains
uncertain because the Council w ill meet on Tuesday
to consider the five additional charges.
I he six charges were initially filed on Wednes
day, April 2(i In five members of the Graduate Stu
dent Council. ASSU President Mike Levin joined on
two of the charges. Last week. Levin dropped his
name 112 rom the charges.
I he five members of the Council, Chair Harris
Shapiro, a doctoral student in physics, doctoral stu
dent in applied physics Robert Rudnitsky, mechani
cal engineering doctoral student Llizabeth Loboa
Polefka, sophomore David Lin and junior Shaumo
Sadlnikhan heard arguments on either side of the
casr under consideration.
I he charge alleges that all results of the April 19
— 20 election where graduate students voted, in
cluding ASM President/Vice-president, Graduate
Student Council, GSC-only special fees and joint
special fees, ma) be found unconstitutional because
the GSC never approved the demerit system.
Last night, the Council limited the charge to the
ASSI Presidential election, because demerits were
onh used in that election and not any of the others
under consideration.
Ihe respondents to this charge were ASSU
Hearings Officer Katie Young, a junior, and the
Elections Commission. Young was not present at
the hearing.
I n the course of the debate, electrical engineering
doctoral student Paul 11 art kt*, one of the (>S(. mem
bers who filed the initial complaint, said, "the un
constitutional act is the application of that rule to the
election. The Undergraduate Senate is free to pass
am rules thev so choose, but when [the demerit sys
tem | was enacted by the Elections Commission it be
came an unconstitutional act."
Elections Commissioner Jason Kang, a cotermi
nal student in economics, and members of the Un-i
dcrgraduate Senate defended the elections rules de
veloped In the Commission, based on the difficulty
in coordinating the governing documents of the Un
dergraduate Senate and the (ISC.
Senior Dan Perkel, a former elections commis
sioner, said, "It's hard to even decipher where the
constitutionality even is."
I lie council determined that the GSC had never
approved the penalty system governing the elec-i
tions, including the demerit sys
tem. The council also determined
that for elections involving the
higher population, the two bod
ies only jointly have the power,
not individually.
In finding the demerit system
to be unconstitutional, Shapiro
said "the constitution is pretty
clear that the bodies have the
power to make rules jointly ... if
one of the bodies hasn't passed
that rule, the rule can't lie en
forced."
The Council has no authority

to take any disciplinary measures
against any student.
Following the determination
of unconstitutionality, the* Coun
cil considered whether the acts
under scrutiny — the creation of
rules governing the election by
the Elections Commission —
were performed in good faith.
"Good faith" was defined by the
Council as a good faith effort to
inform oneself of the relevant
governing documents, and con
scientious attempts to abide by
them.
Lin, who voted to reinstate the
election results along with Sad
hukan and Loboa I'olefka due to
good faith efforts on behalf of

Young and the Flections Com
mission, cited last year's amend
ment splitting the ASSI as an ex
planation lor the oversight,
"Because we have had so
many changes to these docu
ments recently," Lin said, "and
because it appears that Katie
Young and the Elections Com
mission realized there may have
been a problem, they decided to
retract the demerits system . . .
that represents an attempt to im
plement thv elections as fairly as
possible."
Rudnitsky and Shapiro voted
to find the election proceedings
"not in good fait h." I hey empha
sized that a llndi 111; of "not in

good faith" did not indicate any
malicious intent on (lie part of
the respondent, hut said the
('.ommission should have sought
more input from the (iSC
"The constitution is very clear
on what has to he done to get
rules approved that apply to
both bodies," said Shapiro. "It is
not reasonable ... to assume
that, well, the other body must
have approved it. I don't think
[the election rules] can be held to
be done in good failh."
The six alleged violations of the
constitution name members of the
