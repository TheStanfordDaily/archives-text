Who's the Social
Security beneficiary?
You can't tell just by looking who's
getting Social Security benefits
because a parent died, is disabled,
or retired.
Today, 3 million kids under age 18
get monthly Social Security benefits,
based on a parent's earnings.
And, Social Security protects more
than 70 million kids.
To learn more about Social Security,
call 1-800-772-1213. Ask for the booklet
Basic Facts About Social Security.
