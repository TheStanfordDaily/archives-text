A Daily report from this year on a base
ball tournament between the fraternities on
campus reminds us that while Greek orga
nizations may come and go, be housed and
unhoused, some things never change.
"Glenn Waterman, Sigma Chi pitcher,
repeated his performance of last week when
he held the Theta Chis to three hits and one
run in the only hard ball game scheduled
yesterday. The Sigma Chis scored 13 runs to
win. Waterman struck out nine opposing
batsmen.
"Chi Psi scored five runs in the last inning
of their game against Sigma Nu to win a
hotly contested encounter 14-10. The Busi
ness School easily defeated Delta Tau Delta
10-3 in a game that was halted in the fourth
inning because of darkness.
"Led by Jack Redhead, who hits safely
four times out of four trips to the plate, the
Kappa Sig's beat the Theta Delts 11-8. The
ATOs won a default victory from Zeta Psi 1-
0."
The Bottom Line: Business School students have
always had nothing better to do than practice
for intramurals.
