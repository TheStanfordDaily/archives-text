Stanford already pushed through a
parking ban on Junipero Serra Boule
vard, the main road that runs along
side the Dish lands. Now, they want to
ban parking on the nearest side street,
largely because the residents of the
neighborhood, all of whom are Stan
ford affiliated, don't like all the cars
on the street.
All the while, Stanford officials in
sist they really do want the public to
have access to the Dish. In other
words, Stanford is willing to accom
modate anyone who wants to hike the
Dish, unless they want to park nearby
so that they can hike the Dish. 7 don't
think it's unreasonable for members of
the public to expect access to public
parking on a public road, paid for
with public funds, in the absence of
some real safety problem,' said Super
visor Joe Simitian, whose district in
cludes Stanford.
