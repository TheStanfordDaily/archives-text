dral altar that was his pulpit for l(i years, alter a
funeral Mass that drew thousands of mourners, from
presidents to ordinary parishioners.
"Cod girted him with a keen and subtle intellect,
an uncommon rhetorical skill, a knack lor the dra

ol humor — all of which he used in the service of
preaching," (Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston, a close
friend ol ()'(lonnor's lor the past !V r > years, said in his

ing him to us."
