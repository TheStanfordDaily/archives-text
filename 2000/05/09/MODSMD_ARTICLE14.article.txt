• FREETOWN, Sierra Leone
(AP) — Already badly frayed Irom
'a week of political violence, Siena
. Leone's capital began to rip along
the seams yesterday as a rally
turned into a shooting spree, with
rebel soldiers gunning down at
least four protesters.
The chaos that broke out at the
'•demonstration at rebel leader
. l oday SunkohV«hotK£ quickly spi
rafe'd, and"soon heavily-armed
'soldiers from all the country's fac
, tions cruised the streets of this
West African coastal city, gripping
machine guns and hanging out
• 'the windows of their vehicles.
United Nations spokesman
David Wimhurst said Sierra
.Leone's peace process had been
"seriously dented," by the vio
' lence that erupted yesterday."It
remains to be seen it we can
retrieve it."
Foreign nationals and aid
• groups were evacuating, includ
ing hundreds of British citizens
who poured into one ol the c ity's
two main hotels, clutching pass
ports and suitcases and waiting
lor a British militarv force to get
.'them out.
A Sierra Leonean woman who
said rebels had killed her husband
''and four of their children last year
»,waited in a hotel courtyard with
her 9-year-old daughter — a
jiritish citizen.
'.*• "I don't want to lose her too,"
she said, holding her daughter s

shoulder as she waited to send the
girl away to salet\.
I he United Nations ordered
the evacuation of most of its civil
ian stall yesterday, and U.N. Sec
retat v-( ieneral Kofi Annan issued
a statement saving he was
"extremely concerned about the
rapidly deteriorating situation."
1 le repeated his call to Western
imy«rnnu'nts to send in a well
equipped rapid reaction lbrce to
restore older.
The U.N.'s World Food Pro
gram, which has provided emer
gency lood to 1.2 million Sierra
Leoneans over the past 10
months, said it was suspending
relief operations in much of the
country because of "high risks"
faced by staff and to the pro
grain's supplies, WFP spokesman
Wagdi ()thman said.
1 he escalation began when at
least "),()()() marchers rallying lor
an end to hostilities and to
denounce the rebels began mov
ing toward Sankoh's house, hurl
ing large rocks and bricks at the
simple, two-story home.
"We are on the streets today to
show the world that Foday
Sankoh is nobody but a monster
who wants to kill the people of
Sierra Leone,"' demonstrator
Abubakarr Sillah said before the
march.
The do/ens of U.N. peace
keepers guarding the house were
overwhelmed by the crowds,

pushing against them and shout
ing ineffectively as dcinonstraioi s
advanced, some singing a song
with I\l ies calling fbi Sankoli to he
beheaded and castrated.
Rebel lighters, standing behind
the U.N. troops, fired through the
l .N. ranks, spraying (he crowd
with automatic weapons and roc k
et-propelled grenades.
With the gunfire, the crowd
began to.llee in panic and do/ens
were wounded in the shooting
and the subsequent stampede.
I he peacekeepers shouted .it
the rebels to "cease-lire!" then
began firing into the air to get the
crowds to leave.
Corinna Schiller, a |ohannes
burg-based journalist I'oi I"he
(Christian Science Monitor, said
she look shelter in a small build
ing at San koh's compound during
the stampede.
Later, two Sierra I.coneans
joined her in the hiding place.
When they were discovered b\
the rebels, one was immedialeh
slk>l and killed. The <>lher. altei
begging l< »r his life, was alsi > killed.
"I will let vou go because \on
are a journalist." the soldier told
her. "I want \on to tell those bo\s
I hey must never come to protest
at Foe lay Sankoli s house again.
