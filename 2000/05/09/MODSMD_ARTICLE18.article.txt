## The 						Stanford Daily Asia/Pacific scholars program axed too soon

UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT GER
hard (Jasper's recent decision to dis
continue the Asia/Pacific Scholar's
Program comes as an unexpected
and unwelcome announcement.
The program, which debuted in 1997, was
created in hopes of training visionary leaders
across a wide range ol disciplines to guide 112 u
ture decision-making in the rapidly developing
Asia Pacific region. In addition, the program
was designed to foster a commitment at Stan
ford to the emerging Pacific community.
In order to achieve these goals, participants
in the program, who are admitted into the pro
gram after being accepted into regular gradu
ate or professional degree programs at Stan
ford, participate in year-long interdisciplinary

seminars that examine the political and eco
nomic relationships in the region and how they
relate to cultural contexts.
Casper's decision to suspend the program
seems somewhat premature. I le stated two rea
sons for his decision, the first being that the pro
gram had yet to achieve adequate funding and
the second that it had failed to live up to his ex
pectations. But it seems that the program
should have been given more time —it has only
been three years since its inception — to work
out its kinks.
Casper initially hoped that the program
would fund 20 scholars for two years, but only
six scholars were able to be fully funded while
the other scholars received $5,000 stipends. In
addition, the program fell $30 million short of

pubimistoM,

its $50 million fundraising goal.
Yet, given the demonstrated interest in the
program despite its inadequate funds (the in
augural class started with 19 graduate students
and was followed the next year by 22 scholars),
it seems irrational to suspend it. The lack of
funding for maintaining a full program of stu
dents should not preclude funding being given
to those students the program is able to fund.
Current participants in the program even
stated that they chose to stay and participate in
it for the community it created and for its cur
riculum, as opposed to the money it provided
them to study. Perhaps the program's partici
pants should have been consulted first to field
ideas on how to preserve it, how to achieve its
initial goals and / or how to reform it.

The decision to suspend the program seems
especially unfortunate given that Stanford's
commitment to Asian-related studies lias been,
and continues to be, criticized as inadequate.
How can the University compete with peer in
stitutions if it does not have as good or better de
partments than they do in areas as relevant and
vital as this one?
Casper's recent decision should not be the
final chapter in the Asia / Pacific Scholars Pro
grain. Its participants hope to come up with
concrete solutions to its funding problems, and
Gasper, along witli Provost John Hennessy,
who will soon take over as University president,
should work with these scholars in making
every effort to continue the program.
