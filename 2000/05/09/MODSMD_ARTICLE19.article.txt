# FARM LIFE
## Win, lose, or...Draw 
### 
Two thousand, eight hundred
eighteen. That's a really big
number. That's how much a
small elephant weighs. Or a car
even. At 2.NIN feet, you'd be on top of a
good sized mountain on the Fast Coast.
Around 2,NI<S people live in the small
town where my mom grew up. II you di
vided into two, you'd get 1,409 —
that's probably an important year in world
history, if noihingelse because it's H.'i years

before Columbus
"sailed the ocean blue."
What else is cool about
2,818? Oh, yeah, it's my
draw number.
Oh Draw, Draw,
how do I love thee? I.et
mt' count the ways, all
3,000 of them. Yes,
lolks, it's everyone's fa
vorite time of year —
when friendships get

ripped asunder as Draw groups get
formed, the one time we logon to Axessat
all hours to (heck something other than
grades, stakeout "the housing office near
you" just to get that little — or big — num
ber a dav early, and make beautiful bous
ing choice lists that, in reality, we'd never
get into even il we tried.
In my case, I could list Bob, Xanadu,
Storey, Whitman, Lambda Nu, 557, 553,
f>Bo, and, lor kicks, something crazy like
Potter, .iikl know that no matter what I
put in, my number is just too low to get in
anywhere. I can't even jokingly console
myself by saving, "Well, I guess va'll can
come visit me in Sena or Okada next
year," because even lliev draw higher than
my number.
Apparently, though, I've been told
2,KI(S is actually not so bad. One is unas
signed, and then shunted into whatever is
left over after everyone else is settled —
random spots in random houses. This isn't
nearly as bad as it sounds because it could
be that I end up in a Row House — or,
then again, in the basement of Wilbur.
It's a big gamble, and, sadly, one 1 have
absolutely no control over. I think that's
what I hate most about the Draw — Un
complete lack nl control. One never has
any idea of what to expect, though. In my
experience, the results of the Draw tend to
be the opposite of what one expected orig
inally.
I (hew with eight buddies from my
frosli dorm last year and, the naive fresh
men that we were, we of course assumed
we'd get into somewhere on the Row or, at
worst (though at the time I advocated it
strongly), I oyon. However, we drew
1,235, another big number which seems
shockingly low from the unpreferred per
spective. That sent us to Robinson — lar,

far, away on another part ol Stanford cam
pus called Governor's Corner — I think
because it's c loser to Sacramento than to
iht* Main Quad.
It turned out to be line in the end, de
spite all our bitching and moaning at the
time — Ricker became one of the best
places to eat on campus and Robinson was
a great plat e to live with two-room doubles
— a palace after Stern. On top of that,
l here were small manifestations of a social
life in (JovCo — we even had a party or
two.
Bui like most of my soon-to-be junior
brethren, I had to click "unpreferred" this
lime around on Axess. Most of my old draw
group became stall, and (lie lew of us that
remained had our own plans; some were
going overseas, I only planned to be here
next year for two quarters, and yatltla,
yadda, yatltla. And so I drew alone.
Drawing alone is a scary, scary
prospect. I've heard the horror stories,
and I've heard the good stories, and ii
sounds like the good outweigh the bad.
But it's still a bit unnerving not knowing
who (if anyone) will be my roommate next
year, lei alone not even knowing where Ill
be living. I grabbed priority in the house
most of my old drawmates are staff in, but,
unfortunately, so did 150 others. And,
with 2,H18 as my draw number, I have as
good a chance as getting in there as I do in
(lasper's house: nil.
St> what's there left to do? 1 he answer is
the same for .ill of us, whether you drew
I he number one or 3,000. Basically, we can
only sit back and watch. The Draw, like
most everything at Stanford, is completely
out of our hands. We can do nothing
about it directly, but we can do something
indirectly: make the most of it.
I've learned that the best parts of Stan
ford are the best parts simply because I
made them that way. From horrible Kcon
core classes, to housing out on the REAL
farm, it all comes down to using the situa
tion to your benefit. We can all do this and,
for the Draw, we really have no other
choice. We can complain and mope, or we
can come to terms with whatever number
we drew (granted, an easier task for some)
and make the best of it.
Personally, I've turned the uncertainty
into excitement — I have no idea what the
situation will be in a few months' time, but
worrying about it will certainly get me
nowhere. Draw is like a game, a motion we
all go through, and, in the wisdom of For
rest, you never know what you're going to
get — you just have to wait and see and go
from there.

Apparently, though, I've been told
2,KI(S is actually not so bad. One is unas
signed, and then shunted into whatever is
left over after everyone else is settled —
random spots in random houses. This isn't
nearly as bad as it sounds because it could
be that I end up in a Row House — or,
then again, in the basement of Wilbur.
It's a big gamble, and, sadly, one 1 have
absolutely no control over. I think that's
what I hate most about the Draw — Un
complete lack nl control. One never has
any idea of what to expect, though. In my
experience, the results of the Draw tend to
be the opposite of what one expected orig
inally.
I (hew with eight buddies from my
frosli dorm last year and, the naive fresh
men that we were, we of course assumed
we'd get into somewhere on the Row or, at
worst (though at the time I advocated it
strongly), I oyon. However, we drew
1,235, another big number which seems
shockingly low from the unpreferred per
spective. That sent us to Robinson — lar,

far, away on another part ol Stanford cam
pus called Governor's Corner — I think
because it's c loser to Sacramento than to
iht* Main Quad.
It turned out to be line in the end, de
spite all our bitching and moaning at the
time — Ricker became one of the best
places to eat on campus and Robinson was
a great plat e to live with two-room doubles
— a palace after Stern. On top of that,
l here were small manifestations of a social
life in (JovCo — we even had a party or
two.
Bui like most of my soon-to-be junior
brethren, I had to click "unpreferred" this
lime around on Axess. Most of my old draw
group became stall, and (lie lew of us that
remained had our own plans; some were
going overseas, I only planned to be here
next year for two quarters, and yatltla,
yadda, yatltla. And so I drew alone.
Drawing alone is a scary, scary
prospect. I've heard the horror stories,
and I've heard the good stories, and ii
sounds like the good outweigh the bad.
But it's still a bit unnerving not knowing
who (if anyone) will be my roommate next
year, lei alone not even knowing where Ill
be living. I grabbed priority in the house
most of my old drawmates are staff in, but,
unfortunately, so did 150 others. And,
with 2,H18 as my draw number, I have as
good a chance as getting in there as I do in
(lasper's house: nil.
St> what's there left to do? 1 he answer is
the same for .ill of us, whether you drew
I he number one or 3,000. Basically, we can
only sit back and watch. The Draw, like
most everything at Stanford, is completely
out of our hands. We can do nothing
about it directly, but we can do something
indirectly: make the most of it.
I've learned that the best parts of Stan
ford are the best parts simply because I
made them that way. From horrible Kcon
core classes, to housing out on the REAL
farm, it all comes down to using the situa
tion to your benefit. We can all do this and,
for the Draw, we really have no other
choice. We can complain and mope, or we
can come to terms with whatever number
we drew (granted, an easier task for some)
and make the best of it.
Personally, I've turned the uncertainty
into excitement — I have no idea what the
situation will be in a few months' time, but
worrying about it will certainly get me
nowhere. Draw is like a game, a motion we
all go through, and, in the wisdom of For
rest, you never know what you're going to
get — you just have to wait and see and go
from there.
