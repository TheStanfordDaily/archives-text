E-mails raise concern over

I n response to concern over 11 it- safety of
bicyclists and pedestrians on campus, the
Hicvclc Safety ( onnnittec has developed an
online bicycle survey lor slutlents, faculix

I lie survey asks whether respondents

campus and which polities — from bike use

addition, surve\ lakers are asked about
t heir own experiences as bikers or petlesl i i

"We are testing the waters to
see what everyone thinks will he
the best solution?"*Clevenger
said.
According to Graves, after as
sessing the results of the survey,
the Bicycle Safety Committee will
work to develop a policy in part
nership with the Office of Resi
dential Education, the Office of
Public Safety, the ASSU and the
Graduate Student Council.
The final solution will likely
favor some bike use restriction.
"This is not an attempt to ban
bicycles," said Clevenger. " There
are some areas where we don't
think bikes should be, [for exam
ple] under covered areas. . .Side
walks [next to bike lanes] would
be another."
Some students doubt whether

regulation will actually be effec
tive.
"I don't really see how to do it
without making too many regula
tions that people aren't going to
follow," said sophomore Ashn
Bhandary.
Others, who think regulations
are necessary, cite the example of
3f)ther universities.
"I've heard of other campuses,
like UC-Santa Barbara, where
there are bike lanes and pedestri
an [lanes] and it works," said
sophomore Katie Hansen.
Sarah Wills, a doctoral student
in Industrial Engineering, said,
"It might be nice to have lanes or
direction."
The future plan will likely
focus on education, which aims to
alter the attitudes toward biking
on campus.
"I think by changing the be
havior. by starting with the fresh
men, we can change the culture of
interaction between bikes and
pedestrians on campus," said Dan
Smith, special services manager at

the (Mfice of Public Safety.
Some students doubt the effec
tiveness of bicycle education pro
grams, specifically mandatory
bike safety training.
"Mandatory education doesn't
make a lot of sense," said senior
Robert ('.biles. "If placed in that
situation, I don't think that stu
dents would respond positively.
In orclei to learn something, stu
dents must be engaged."
Many students believe that ad
vertising campaigns and volun
tary education programs would
be effective.
Committee members hope the
education programs will be suc
cessful and law enforcement will
therefore be avoided.
"An education campaign
would have to fail before we | im
plemented] an enforcement
arm," said Graves.
In fact, in order to enforce the
California Motor Vehicle Code on
the inner campus, which is
presently considered "off road"
and therefore exempt from

motor vehicle laws, Santa Clara
(lounty would have to pass an or
dinance, said Smith.
Over 2,800 members of the
Stanford community, including
undergraduates, graduates, fac
ulty and staff, have already re
sponded to the survey, which
began May 1.
So far, responses are varied.
"There are results which say
that police should not do any
thing, and others who think [bike
safety] is a serious problem," said
Graduate Student Counc il mem
ber Paul Hartke, a doctoral stu
dent in electrical engineering,
who helped design the survey.
Some people think there will
be a difference in response be
tween graduate and undergradu

" The graduate students will be
looking for more active solutions

Crowded walkways and rushed bikers prompted the formation of the Bicycle Safety Committee. The committee's bicycle safety

clay, will help them to better un
dei stand campus opinion.
"We are testing the waters to
see what everyone thinks will he
the best solution?"*Clevenger
said.
According to Graves, after as
sessing the results of the survey,
the Bicycle Safety Committee will
work to develop a policy in part
nership with the Office of Resi
dential Education, the Office of
Public Safety, the ASSU and the
Graduate Student Council.
The final solution will likely
favor some bike use restriction.
"This is not an attempt to ban
bicycles," said Clevenger. " There
are some areas where we don't
think bikes should be, [for exam
ple] under covered areas. . .Side
walks [next to bike lanes] would
be another."
Some students doubt whether

regulation will actually be effec
tive.
"I don't really see how to do it
without making too many regula
tions that people aren't going to
follow," said sophomore Ashn
Bhandary.
Others, who think regulations
are necessary, cite the example of
3f)ther universities.
"I've heard of other campuses,
like UC-Santa Barbara, where
there are bike lanes and pedestri
an [lanes] and it works," said
sophomore Katie Hansen.
Sarah Wills, a doctoral student
in Industrial Engineering, said,
"It might be nice to have lanes or
direction."
The future plan will likely
focus on education, which aims to
alter the attitudes toward biking
on campus.
"I think by changing the be
havior. by starting with the fresh
men, we can change the culture of
interaction between bikes and
pedestrians on campus," said Dan
Smith, special services manager at

the (Mfice of Public Safety.
Some students doubt the effec
tiveness of bicycle education pro
grams, specifically mandatory
bike safety training.
"Mandatory education doesn't
make a lot of sense," said senior
Robert ('.biles. "If placed in that
situation, I don't think that stu
dents would respond positively.
In orclei to learn something, stu
dents must be engaged."
Many students believe that ad
vertising campaigns and volun
tary education programs would
be effective.
Committee members hope the
education programs will be suc
cessful and law enforcement will
therefore be avoided.
"An education campaign
would have to fail before we | im
plemented] an enforcement
arm," said Graves.
In fact, in order to enforce the
California Motor Vehicle Code on
the inner campus, which is
presently considered "off road"
and therefore exempt from

motor vehicle laws, Santa Clara
(lounty would have to pass an or
dinance, said Smith.
Over 2,800 members of the
Stanford community, including
undergraduates, graduates, fac
ulty and staff, have already re
sponded to the survey, which
began May 1.
So far, responses are varied.
"There are results which say
that police should not do any
thing, and others who think [bike
safety] is a serious problem," said
Graduate Student Counc il mem
ber Paul Hartke, a doctoral stu
dent in electrical engineering,
who helped design the survey.
Some people think there will
be a difference in response be
tween graduate and undergradu
ate students.
" The graduate students will be
looking for more active solutions
and the undergraduates looking
for more passive, optional solu
tions," predicts Chair of the bicy
cle Safety C lot limit tee Juan Busta
nianle, a sophomore.
