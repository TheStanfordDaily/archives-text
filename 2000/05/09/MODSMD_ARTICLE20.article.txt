Knee-jerk response to genetic
engineering unnecessary
We are writing in response to Martha
Roberts' guest column ("The perils of ge
netic engineering") printed in The Daily
on May 4.
While some of Roberts' contentions are
fair, we must keep in mind that the term
"natural" does not equate with "good." If
we truly lived in a "natural" state, we
would be bereft of all of the benefits of
modern technology, including vaccines,
electricity and the host of daily engineer
ing marvels that most take for granted.
Roberts' screeds against "manipulating
Nature to extract a few more dollars from
our soil" verge dangerously close to the ir
rational philosophy of the Luddites. The
platonic idyll of nature envisioned by the
activists, wherein man lives harmoniously
with his planet, is a fantasy created by
those made blissfully comfortable in their
climate controlled environments.
I low many of you would enjoy a life
wherein each day the pressing question
was whether you would survive to the
next? How many of you would enjoy living
with rotting plaque-encrusted teeth, with
constant fear of starvation or environmen
tal calamity, with the knowledge that you
would be lucky to live beyond 30?
Let us be clear: modern science and
technology are very good things for hu
manity.

I hat said, our focus should then turn to
genetic engineering of crops with an eye
for insuring its safety rather than an intent
to stifle it unthinkingly. Roberts brings up
a good point when she talks of the poten
tiality of reducing genetic diversity
through widespread genetic engineering,
a factor that must be taken into account
when modifying crops in the future.
But our fear of an unknown disastrous
disease or pest must be balanced by our
fear of the known. We know that a crop
without the proper resistance will be vul
nerable to temperature, rainfall or insects,
and genetic engineering provides us the
means to protect against known dangers.
While chemical pesticides can cause
harmful effects if not washed off, so can
worm-ridden crops or fungus covered
fruits. The fact that one is a chemical
threat and one is a biological threat should
not be interpreted as meaning that one is
more desirable than the other. The only
way to determine what our chosen risk
should be is through the analysis of care
fully controlled experiments.
(ienetic engineering offers us the abili
ty to help farmers in impoverished coun
tries and provides the means to accom
plish the next Green Revolution in time to
feed the billions of people who will live in
the next century. To her credit, Roberts
acknowledges that the potential for creat
ing vitamin-enhanced crops and the like
should not be ignored.

However, any good karma acquired is
summarily canceled by Roberts' subse
quent suggestion that protest of Monsanto
and Novartis "will have no ill effect (>n
these humanitarian actions." This state
ment is naive at best and purposefully
disingenuous at worst.
The madding crowd whipped into
enough of a frenzy to sabotage farmers'
crops (as has happened all over Europe] is
not going to be able to drop its precon
ceived notions about "Fran ken foods" just
because a particular crop's genetic engi
neering is sanctioned as "humanitarian"
by a few activists.
While the "heavily educated" Euro
pean public does not question the hosLof
chemical additives found in the ingredi
ents list of any modern packaged food, the
work of demagogues has incited them to
take umbrage at any suggestion of genetic
engineering. [
The only reason that this technology is
evoking such a negative response is be
cause it is unfamiliar. The goal of the ac
tivists is to replicate this feeling in America
by denoting the whole of agricultural ge
netic engineering as "biological pollu
tion," in Roberts' own careful and riu
anced words.
Roberts' main claim is that the true
danger of genetic engineering lies in its
unforeseen consequences. This is true, but

it should not be used as a rationale to avoid
all further experiments. For example, we
have Phase I, 11, and 111 clinical trials to
provide an assessment of the possible ex
ternalities of medicines.
The failure of one drug to prove its
safety does not impinge upon the percep
tion of the efficacy or reliability of other
medications. In the same way, a rational
public would not take the demonstrated
toxicity of one crop as proof positive that
all genetically modified crops should be
banned.
While labeling of genetically modified
foods is indeed fair, the truth is that most
of the public would not use such labeling
in an intelligent fashion. In truth, how
many of you know the biological effects of
the innumerable man-made chemicals
you ingest every day in your cereals,
sweets, and drinks?
The stamp of genetic modification
would be used as a stigma rather than con
sidered dt' rigueur like the current listed
litany of chemical additives. It is for this
reason that biotechnology corporations do

Perils of genetic engineering

Martha Roberts' column in last Thurs
day's Daily ("The perils of genetic engi

food raises several important issues about
how genetic engineering affects our daily
lives and the foods we eat. Surely for such
an important issue the facts should be
available.
However, Roberts' information is mis
leading and incorrect. First, Europeans
(and Americans for that matter) are not
"heavily educated" about this issue. Only
52 percent of Americans knew the answer
to "genetically engineered tomatoes have
genes but natural tomatoes do not." This is
the best percentage of 15 industrial na
tions surveyed, so, the United States is ac
tually more informed about the basics of
genetic engineering than anywhere else.
With this level of misunderstanding
concerning genetics (DNA is not evil as
some people believe â€” it is in everything
you eat from tomatoes to popcorn), not
only must the facts be presented, but a
basic education concerning biology must
first be taught.
True, a lack of genetic diversity in crops
is potentially dangerous, but this lias been
going on long before recombinant DNA
technology. Farmers have always selected
the best crop producing plant and used
that for the next generation, regardless of
whether it has "fish genes" or not. Organ
ically grown foods are not any different.
Roberts actually stated a benefit of ge
netic engineering in her argument against
it. Contrary to her beliefs, crops do not
produce their own pesticides, lit crops
were created through recombinant DNA
technology to reduce the amounts of pes
ticides used on plants. This has succeeded
in reducing insecticide use on cotton in
California by two million pounds in 1999.

Kach citizen had 50 fewer grains of insecti
cide added to the environment thanks to
genetic engineering.
It is a fact that Bt crops do some harm
to natural insects, however, this elfect is
mitigated when considering that the pesti
cides that would normally have been used
would have killed all insects completely
and without regard.
I wholeheartedly agree that compre
hensive testing and precautions should be
used for this new technology. 1 also en
courage readers to become informed
about this issue and look beyond the hype
and propaganda put forth by proponents
of both sides of this issue.

Rheins responds to criticisms
of Elian position
Let me begin by mentioning that the ac -
tual title of my first letter ("A new view on
Elian Gonzalez," April 27) was "Professors
vs. Elian's Freedom." Though it did not
grace the head of my letter, it came
through as the theme. I have read a num
ber of responses to my letter. Here is my
brief retort. Captured as a phrase, this let
ter's theme would be "Students vs. Moral
Judgment."
To those who claim that Cuba lias the
best living standards in all of Latin .Ameri
ca, I say: These are still terrible numbers
when compared to those of the industrial
West. Furthermore, many experts are
skeptical of Cuba's official statistics, as
many of them were prepared by the
Cuban government.
To those who claim that the single
biggest problem in Cuba is the l .S. em
bargo, 1 say: The single biggest problem in
Cuba is the (loninuuiist regime that would
use Americ an goods to make their countn
appear like a normal one. Why is it that
America can produce a mass of wealth)
goods, and by what vicious moral standard
does the Cuban government assert a right
to them? Why should Americans spend

their dollars supporting a stale* that is the
avowed enemy of I lie United States and its
basic values?
To (hose who claim that the United
States is equally guilty of the violation of
human rights, I say: Between the United
States and (luba there is one fundamental
difference. One is a nation whose govern
ment's purpose is to protect rights, but has
failed at that goal. The other is a nation
whose government s purpose is to control
humans, thus violating rights, and it has
succeeded in doing so. Any man who risks
his life to escape to ('.uba can easily explain
to you the actual dillerence between some
freedom in America and all control in
Cuba.
To those who claim that I, in the Unit
ed States, have no right to judge the
Cuban way ol life, 1 sav: Slavery is not a
lifestyle. Men are not meant to live as dogs.
They must think, not obey. They must
live, not survive. If you have no moral
standards at all, then st< >p clamoring to en
slave those who do.
As 1 wrote in my first letter, in any dis
cussion about Cuba, the United States can
and must take the moral high ground, if
for no other reason other than the fact
that, in this country, I can still publicly
curse those who would send a child into
slavery.

More on open space and the Foothills
I would like to add my voice to the
many voices protesting any changes to
Stanford's Foothills area. It is the only de
cent place students and locals c an go for a
relaxing, beautiful walk. People can take
their children, friends, and dogs and just
enjoy being outside.
I protest any development on this and
any other Stanford open area. I also see no
reason why dogs on leashes should not be
allowed to enjoy the Foothills.
I look to Stanford, as a learning institu
tion, as one ol the few institutions that may
actually LEARN from the past and realize
that bigger is not necessarily better and
that we must turn away from endless
growth and embrace sustainable solutions.

Knee-jerk response to genetic

We are writing in response to Martha
Roberts' guest column ("The perils of ge
netic engineering") printed in The Daily
on May 4.
While some of Roberts' contentions are
fair, we must keep in mind that the term
"natural" does not equate with "good." If
we truly lived in a "natural" state, we
would be bereft of all of the benefits of
modern technology, including vaccines,
electricity and the host of daily engineer
ing marvels that most take for granted.
Roberts' screeds against "manipulating
Nature to extract a few more dollars from
our soil" verge dangerously close to the ir
rational philosophy of the Luddites. The
platonic idyll of nature envisioned by the
activists, wherein man lives harmoniously
with his planet, is a fantasy created by
those made blissfully comfortable in their
climate controlled environments.
I low many of you would enjoy a life
wherein each day the pressing question
was whether you would survive to the
next? How many of you would enjoy living
with rotting plaque-encrusted teeth, with
constant fear of starvation or environmen
tal calamity, with the knowledge that you
would be lucky to live beyond 30?
Let us be clear: modern science and
technology are very good things for hu
manity.

I hat said, our focus should then turn to
genetic engineering of crops with an eye
for insuring its safety rather than an intent
to stifle it unthinkingly. Roberts brings up
a good point when she talks of the poten
tiality of reducing genetic diversity
through widespread genetic engineering,
a factor that must be taken into account
when modifying crops in the future.
But our fear of an unknown disastrous
disease or pest must be balanced by our
fear of the known. We know that a crop
without the proper resistance will be vul
nerable to temperature, rainfall or insects,
and genetic engineering provides us the
means to protect against known dangers.
While chemical pesticides can cause
harmful effects if not washed off, so can
worm-ridden crops or fungus covered
fruits. The fact that one is a chemical
threat and one is a biological threat should
not be interpreted as meaning that one is
more desirable than the other. The only
way to determine what our chosen risk
should be is through the analysis of care
fully controlled experiments.
(ienetic engineering offers us the abili
ty to help farmers in impoverished coun
tries and provides the means to accom
plish the next Green Revolution in time to
feed the billions of people who will live in
the next century. To her credit, Roberts
acknowledges that the potential for creat
ing vitamin-enhanced crops and the like
should not be ignored.

However, any good karma acquired is
summarily canceled by Roberts' subse
quent suggestion that protest of Monsanto
and Novartis "will have no ill effect (>n
these humanitarian actions." This state
ment is naive at best and purposefully
disingenuous at worst.
The madding crowd whipped into
enough of a frenzy to sabotage farmers'
crops (as has happened all over Europe] is
not going to be able to drop its precon
ceived notions about "Fran ken foods" just
because a particular crop's genetic engi
neering is sanctioned as "humanitarian"
by a few activists.
While the "heavily educated" Euro
pean public does not question the hosLof
chemical additives found in the ingredi
ents list of any modern packaged food, the
work of demagogues has incited them to
take umbrage at any suggestion of genetic
engineering. [
The only reason that this technology is
evoking such a negative response is be
cause it is unfamiliar. The goal of the ac
tivists is to replicate this feeling in America
by denoting the whole of agricultural ge
netic engineering as "biological pollu
tion," in Roberts' own careful and riu
anced words.
Roberts' main claim is that the true
danger of genetic engineering lies in its
unforeseen consequences. This is true, but

it should not be used as a rationale to avoid
all further experiments. For example, we
have Phase I, 11, and 111 clinical trials to
provide an assessment of the possible ex
ternalities of medicines.
The failure of one drug to prove its
safety does not impinge upon the percep
tion of the efficacy or reliability of other
medications. In the same way, a rational
public would not take the demonstrated
toxicity of one crop as proof positive that
all genetically modified crops should be
banned.
While labeling of genetically modified
foods is indeed fair, the truth is that most
of the public would not use such labeling
in an intelligent fashion. In truth, how
many of you know the biological effects of
the innumerable man-made chemicals
you ingest every day in your cereals,
sweets, and drinks?
The stamp of genetic modification
would be used as a stigma rather than con
sidered dt' rigueur like the current listed
litany of chemical additives. It is for this
reason that biotechnology corporations do
not want foods to be labeled as "genetical
ly modified."
An intelligent campaign of activism
would focus upon providing increased
funds to the FDA to regulate the industry,
thereby ensuring as best we can that ge
netically modified crops pose no unfore
seen dangers to humanity or the environ
ment.
Ifa crop passed through with the FDA's
seal of approval and a listing of potential
side effects, we should fear it no more than
we fear prescription drugs or food color
ing. Further protest would only be based
on the grounds that the layman's gut in
stinct should be valued over rational scien
tific inquiry.

Perils of genetic engineering
are misrepresented
Martha Roberts' column in last Thurs
day's Daily ("The perils of genetic engi
neering") about the genetic engineering of
food raises several important issues about
how genetic engineering affects our daily
lives and the foods we eat. Surely for such
an important issue the facts should be
available.
However, Roberts' information is mis
leading and incorrect. First, Europeans
(and Americans for that matter) are not
"heavily educated" about this issue. Only
52 percent of Americans knew the answer
to "genetically engineered tomatoes have
genes but natural tomatoes do not." This is
the best percentage of 15 industrial na
tions surveyed, so, the United States is ac
tually more informed about the basics of
genetic engineering than anywhere else.
With this level of misunderstanding
concerning genetics (DNA is not evil as
some people believe â€” it is in everything
you eat from tomatoes to popcorn), not
only must the facts be presented, but a
basic education concerning biology must
first be taught.
True, a lack of genetic diversity in crops
is potentially dangerous, but this lias been
going on long before recombinant DNA
technology. Farmers have always selected
the best crop producing plant and used
that for the next generation, regardless of
whether it has "fish genes" or not. Organ
ically grown foods are not any different.
Roberts actually stated a benefit of ge
netic engineering in her argument against
it. Contrary to her beliefs, crops do not
produce their own pesticides, lit crops
were created through recombinant DNA
technology to reduce the amounts of pes
ticides used on plants. This has succeeded
in reducing insecticide use on cotton in
California by two million pounds in 1999.

Kach citizen had 50 fewer grains of insecti
cide added to the environment thanks to
genetic engineering.
It is a fact that Bt crops do some harm
to natural insects, however, this elfect is
mitigated when considering that the pesti
cides that would normally have been used
would have killed all insects completely
and without regard.
I wholeheartedly agree that compre
hensive testing and precautions should be
used for this new technology. 1 also en

feed the billions of people who will live in
the next century. To her credit, Roberts
acknowledges that the potential for creat
ing vitamin-enhanced crops and the like
should not be ignored.

However, any good karma acquired is
summarily canceled by Roberts' subse
quent suggestion that protest of Monsanto
and Novartis "will have no ill effect (>n
these humanitarian actions." This state
ment is naive at best and purposefully
disingenuous at worst.
The madding crowd whipped into
enough of a frenzy to sabotage farmers'
crops (as has happened all over Europe] is
not going to be able to drop its precon
ceived notions about "Fran ken foods" just
because a particular crop's genetic engi
neering is sanctioned as "humanitarian"
by a few activists.
While the "heavily educated" Euro
pean public does not question the hosLof
chemical additives found in the ingredi
ents list of any modern packaged food, the
work of demagogues has incited them to
take umbrage at any suggestion of genetic
engineering. [
The only reason that this technology is
evoking such a negative response is be
cause it is unfamiliar. The goal of the ac
tivists is to replicate this feeling in America
by denoting the whole of agricultural ge
netic engineering as "biological pollu
tion," in Roberts' own careful and riu
anced words.
Roberts' main claim is that the true
danger of genetic engineering lies in its
unforeseen consequences. This is true, but

it should not be used as a rationale to avoid
all further experiments. For example, we
have Phase I, 11, and 111 clinical trials to
provide an assessment of the possible ex
ternalities of medicines.
The failure of one drug to prove its
safety does not impinge upon the percep
tion of the efficacy or reliability of other
medications. In the same way, a rational
public would not take the demonstrated
toxicity of one crop as proof positive that
all genetically modified crops should be
banned.
While labeling of genetically modified
foods is indeed fair, the truth is that most
of the public would not use such labeling
in an intelligent fashion. In truth, how
many of you know the biological effects of
the innumerable man-made chemicals
you ingest every day in your cereals,
sweets, and drinks?
The stamp of genetic modification
would be used as a stigma rather than con
sidered dt' rigueur like the current listed
litany of chemical additives. It is for this
reason that biotechnology corporations do
not want foods to be labeled as "genetical
ly modified."
An intelligent campaign of activism
would focus upon providing increased
funds to the FDA to regulate the industry,
thereby ensuring as best we can that ge
netically modified crops pose no unfore
seen dangers to humanity or the environ
ment.
Ifa crop passed through with the FDA's
seal of approval and a listing of potential
side effects, we should fear it no more than
we fear prescription drugs or food color
ing. Further protest would only be based
on the grounds that the layman's gut in
stinct should be valued over rational scien
tific inquiry.

Perils of genetic engineering
are misrepresented
Martha Roberts' column in last Thurs
day's Daily ("The perils of genetic engi
neering") about the genetic engineering of
food raises several important issues about
how genetic engineering affects our daily
lives and the foods we eat. Surely for such
an important issue the facts should be
available.
However, Roberts' information is mis
leading and incorrect. First, Europeans
(and Americans for that matter) are not
"heavily educated" about this issue. Only
52 percent of Americans knew the answer
to "genetically engineered tomatoes have
genes but natural tomatoes do not." This is
the best percentage of 15 industrial na
tions surveyed, so, the United States is ac
tually more informed about the basics of
genetic engineering than anywhere else.
With this level of misunderstanding
concerning genetics (DNA is not evil as
some people believe â€” it is in everything
you eat from tomatoes to popcorn), not
only must the facts be presented, but a
basic education concerning biology must
first be taught.
True, a lack of genetic diversity in crops
is potentially dangerous, but this lias been
going on long before recombinant DNA
technology. Farmers have always selected
the best crop producing plant and used
that for the next generation, regardless of
whether it has "fish genes" or not. Organ
ically grown foods are not any different.
Roberts actually stated a benefit of ge
netic engineering in her argument against
it. Contrary to her beliefs, crops do not
produce their own pesticides, lit crops
were created through recombinant DNA
technology to reduce the amounts of pes
ticides used on plants. This has succeeded
in reducing insecticide use on cotton in
California by two million pounds in 1999.

Kach citizen had 50 fewer grains of insecti
cide added to the environment thanks to
genetic engineering.
It is a fact that Bt crops do some harm
to natural insects, however, this elfect is
mitigated when considering that the pesti
cides that would normally have been used
would have killed all insects completely
and without regard.
I wholeheartedly agree that compre
hensive testing and precautions should be
used for this new technology. 1 also en
courage readers to become informed
about this issue and look beyond the hype
and propaganda put forth by proponents
of both sides of this issue.

Rheins responds to criticisms
of Elian position
Let me begin by mentioning that the ac -
tual title of my first letter ("A new view on
Elian Gonzalez," April 27) was "Professors
vs. Elian's Freedom." Though it did not
grace the head of my letter, it came
through as the theme. I have read a num
ber of responses to my letter. Here is my
brief retort. Captured as a phrase, this let
ter's theme would be "Students vs. Moral
Judgment."
To those who claim that Cuba lias the
best living standards in all of Latin .Ameri
ca, I say: These are still terrible numbers
when compared to those of the industrial
West. Furthermore, many experts are
skeptical of Cuba's official statistics, as
many of them were prepared by the
Cuban government.
To those who claim that the single
biggest problem in Cuba is the l .S. em
bargo, 1 say: The single biggest problem in
Cuba is the (loninuuiist regime that would
use Americ an goods to make their countn
appear like a normal one. Why is it that
America can produce a mass of wealth)
goods, and by what vicious moral standard
does the Cuban government assert a right
to them? Why should Americans spend

their dollars supporting a stale* that is the
avowed enemy of I lie United States and its
basic values?
To (hose who claim that the United
States is equally guilty of the violation of
human rights, I say: Between the United
States and (luba there is one fundamental
difference. One is a nation whose govern
ment's purpose is to protect rights, but has
failed at that goal. The other is a nation
whose government s purpose is to control
humans, thus violating rights, and it has
succeeded in doing so. Any man who risks
his life to escape to ('.uba can easily explain
to you the actual dillerence between some
freedom in America and all control in
Cuba.
To those who claim that I, in the Unit
ed States, have no right to judge the
Cuban way ol life, 1 sav: Slavery is not a
lifestyle. Men are not meant to live as dogs.
They must think, not obey. They must
live, not survive. If you have no moral
standards at all, then st< >p clamoring to en
slave those who do.
As 1 wrote in my first letter, in any dis
cussion about Cuba, the United States can
and must take the moral high ground, if
for no other reason other than the fact
that, in this country, I can still publicly
curse those who would send a child into
slavery.

Green Library skateboard
policy unacceptable
Starting this quarter, (ireen I library be
came 11 it* onlv building I know of to stop
letting people even can) skateboards or
roller blades into the building.
I bis is unfortunate because \ou obvi
ously can t lock skateboards and
rollerblades up. 1111 is. people that use
them to get around are out of luck, as am
I because 1 had to start hiding my board
outside and it just got stolen.
So . . . HEY GREEN LIBRARY PEO
PLE: II voi ire not going to allow people to

bring skateboards 01 roller blades into li
braries you should provide some alterna
tive like a sale place to store them. Oh,
yeah, and you should buy me another
skateboard.

More on open space and the Foothills
I would like to add my voice to the
many voices protesting any changes to
Stanford's Foothills area. It is the only de
cent place students and locals c an go for a
relaxing, beautiful walk. People can take
their children, friends, and dogs and just
enjoy being outside.
I protest any development on this and
any other Stanford open area. I also see no
reason why dogs on leashes should not be
allowed to enjoy the Foothills.
I look to Stanford, as a learning institu
tion, as one ol the few institutions that may
actually LEARN from the past and realize
that bigger is not necessarily better and
that we must turn away from endless
growth and embrace sustainable solutions.
SAVE OUR OPEN SPACE!
