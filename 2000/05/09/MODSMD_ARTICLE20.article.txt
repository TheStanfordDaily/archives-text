Knee-jerk response to genetic
engineering unnecessary
We are writing in response to Martha
Roberts' guest column ("The perils of ge
netic engineering") printed in The Daily
on May 4.
While some of Roberts' contentions are
fair, we must keep in mind that the term
"natural" does not equate with "good." If
we truly lived in a "natural" state, we
would be bereft of all of the benefits of
modern technology, including vaccines,
electricity and the host of daily engineer
ing marvels that most take for granted.
Roberts' screeds against "manipulating
Nature to extract a few more dollars from
our soil" verge dangerously close to the ir
rational philosophy of the Luddites. The
platonic idyll of nature envisioned by the
activists, wherein man lives harmoniously
with his planet, is a fantasy created by
those made blissfully comfortable in their
climate controlled environments.
I low many of you would enjoy a life
wherein each day the pressing question
was whether you would survive to the
next? How many of you would enjoy living
with rotting plaque-encrusted teeth, with
constant fear of starvation or environmen
tal calamity, with the knowledge that you
would be lucky to live beyond 30?
Let us be clear: modern science and
technology are very good things for hu
manity.

I hat said, our focus should then turn to
genetic engineering of crops with an eye
for insuring its safety rather than an intent
to stifle it unthinkingly. Roberts brings up
a good point when she talks of the poten
tiality of reducing genetic diversity
through widespread genetic engineering,
a factor that must be taken into account
when modifying crops in the future.
But our fear of an unknown disastrous
disease or pest must be balanced by our
fear of the known. We know that a crop
without the proper resistance will be vul
nerable to temperature, rainfall or insects,
and genetic engineering provides us the
means to protect against known dangers.
While chemical pesticides can cause
harmful effects if not washed off, so can
worm-ridden crops or fungus covered
fruits. The fact that one is a chemical
threat and one is a biological threat should
not be interpreted as meaning that one is
more desirable than the other. The only
way to determine what our chosen risk
should be is through the analysis of care
fully controlled experiments.
(ienetic engineering offers us the abili
ty to help farmers in impoverished coun
tries and provides the means to accom
plish the next Green Revolution in time to
feed the billions of people who will live in
the next century. To her credit, Roberts
acknowledges that the potential for creat
ing vitamin-enhanced crops and the like
should not be ignored.

However, any good karma acquired is
summarily canceled by Roberts' subse
quent suggestion that protest of Monsanto
and Novartis "will have no ill effect (>n
these humanitarian actions." This state
ment is naive at best and purposefully
disingenuous at worst.
The madding crowd whipped into
enough of a frenzy to sabotage farmers'
crops (as has happened all over Europe] is
not going to be able to drop its precon
ceived notions about "Fran ken foods" just
because a particular crop's genetic engi
neering is sanctioned as "humanitarian"
by a few activists.
While the "heavily educated" Euro
pean public does not question the hosLof
chemical additives found in the ingredi
ents list of any modern packaged food, the
work of demagogues has incited them to
take umbrage at any suggestion of genetic
engineering. [
The only reason that this technology is
evoking such a negative response is be
cause it is unfamiliar. The goal of the ac
tivists is to replicate this feeling in America
by denoting the whole of agricultural ge
netic engineering as "biological pollu
tion," in Roberts' own careful and riu
anced words.
Roberts' main claim is that the true
danger of genetic engineering lies in its
unforeseen consequences. This is true, but
