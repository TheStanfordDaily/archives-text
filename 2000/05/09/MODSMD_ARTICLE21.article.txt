# Seniors prepare time capsule
## 
### ANNE CORTINA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Hiking through the Quad, few
students realize ilit'v ait- pedaling
ovei 100 years of memories and
treasures.
Bui beneath eaeli plaque set in
the Quad's walkway I it's a time
capsule plated there In a gradu
ating c lass. I 'lie vacuum-sealed
capsules — which have never
been opened— reflect events,
people and the environment ol
the I niversity.
I 'his year's senioi class will
continue the tradition. Class
presidents Lynn Chin, (llnis
( ollins, 1)« »u<4 \loone\ and Kciko
( )s;iki, have been < ollet ting mate
i i.ils to put in the 2000 time cap
sule. I lie group s;t\es articles,

programs and other Class of 2000
paraphernalia to symbolize the
senior class.
At the moment, the class of
2000 capsule consists of Big (iame
inomentos, a Rose Bowl ticket
stub, millennium remembrances
and newspaper articles featuring
the senior class or marking major
events. And as graduation quickly
approaches, the group is search
ing for more items to place in the
capsule.
"I think it's mainly tokens of
major events that we have saved,"
said ()saki. "We've been collec ting
cool things."'
I he presidents are not the
only students who can add to the
collection. During the plaque
dedication ceremony on Bac
calaureate Day, any senior can

donate a momento to be sealed in
the capsule.
The ceremony will be among
the whirlwind of events that take
place on graduation weekend, but
Osaki recommends students lake
the time to participate.
"It's a learning experience for
everyone," she said. "It really uni
fies the class and ties you to Stan
ford."
l here are no plans to open a
time capsule this year, according
to Victor Madrigal, associate di
rector of alumni programs for the
Stanford Alumni Association.
"To my knowledge the class
plaque is handled by the Stanford
events office and they are not
planning on revealing any con
tents from past time capsules,"
Madrigal said.

Osaki said that tlie current
presidents wouldn't approve of a
capsule being opened this year.
"It seems like such an amazing
thing to unseal that, and an amaz
ing thing to keep it sealed," Osaki
said.
She said the interest in keeping
the capsules sealed is related to
the rich history Stanford has
maintained in other ways. She
does see the time capsules as
unique, though.
"I'm sure that once the cap
sules are opened, there will be
themes running through," she
said, "but there will also be a
change through the times."
For now, seniors can anxiously
debate what they want to leave for
the future. A freshman facebook?
A Gaieties poster? An athletic jer

sey? Whatever they choose, it will
help someone years 112 rom now fig
ure out just what the senior class
was like.

"It's sort of neat," Osaki said,
"the feeling that people hundreds
or thousands of years later can sfce
what our class was like."

plaques, which run along the edge of the Quad.
