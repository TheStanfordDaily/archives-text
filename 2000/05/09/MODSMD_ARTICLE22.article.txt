Carson started the project in 1985
with the goal of publishing a 14-vol
ume edition of King's most important
correspondence, sermons, speeches,
published writings and unpublished
manuscripts.
" This project has been a great c hal
lenge. We've accessed over 300
arc hives and talked to various individ
uals to obtain the necessary collection
of King's papers," Carson said.
"Additionally, it's provided a very
unique resource for Stanford students
who have the opportunity to partici
pate in this very important social sci

Students and other staff working

on the project research the back
ground of the papers, providing an
notation in the form of headnotes and
footnotes to foster a better under
standing of King's material.

leaders of the civil rights movements
who come in to talk about King which

work on the project during her fresh

latest volume as "an incredible experi

"I really feel like I'm a part of it.
One of the greatest things about the
Project is the intimacy you have with
the rest of the staff. Everyone is very
integrated, and it has been a great
place to grow intellectually," Hardy
said.
Since the first volume was pub
lished eight years ago "The Papers of
Martin Luther King, Jr." has been well
received by not only critics but read
ers.
Ebony magazine described the
chronicle as "one of those rare pub
lishing events that generate as much
excitement in the cloistered confines
of the academy as they do in the gen
eral public."
