"It's a onee-in-a-generation event that Bob Solow
and Milton Friedman are signinga letter on the same
side- of a major public policy issue," said Summers.
I he letter argues that Americans can only gain
from increased access to Chinese markets because
Chinese businesses already have free access to our
markets under our trade and tariff laws.
" I here is no doubt in anyone's mind, inside 01
outside the economics profession, that China will be
a large market , needing an awful lot of stuff for a
very long time," said Solow.
Solow also noted that increased trade can ad
vance the progress of human rights and the expan
sion of democracy in China "far better than annual
speeches" from the President or Congress. If China
joined the WTO, any trade dispute that a country
brought against it would be resolved in WTO arbi
tration, rather than between the two countries.
Summers said that free trade with China would
be both sound macroeconomic policy and sound
business policy. Il would also encourage China to
adopt more characteristics of a c apitalist economy,
such as intellectual property rights and the rule of
law.
