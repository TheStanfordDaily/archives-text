## No. 2 baseball downs Beavers, ends series 2-1 The
						Cardinal close out game-ending win to maintain its half game lead over UCLA 
### BRETT KAUFMAN STAFF WRITER 
A lot happened, but not much changed.
Senior Edmund Muth's RBI-double in
the top of the eighth inning in Sunday's se
ries finale with Oregon State broke a 5-5 tie
with the Beavers to lead newly ranked No. 2
Stanford to a 7-5 victory. The win kept the
Cardinal one-half game ahead of UCLA in
the Pacific 10 Conference standings for the
second straight week.
Muth's game-winner was followed by ju
nior Joe Borchard's team-leading 53rd RBI
of the season, on a single to left, to cap off the
win.
"This was another big win for this team,"
said head coach Mark Marquess. "We have

now assured ourselves to play for at least a
share of the Pac-10 the final weekend of the
regular season versus UCLA."
After taking two of three games in Cor
vallis, Ore., the Cardinal stands with two
more wins and one more loss than the Bru
ins with just three games left on its confer
ence slate.
UCLA has six games remaining in league
play, having served its idle week earlier this
season. The extra series gives the Bruins a
chance to overtake an idle Stanford team
over the upcoming weekend with a three
game sweep or tie the Cardinal by taking two
of three.
The exciting win to conclude the series
should not have been so exciting. Stanford
took a 5-1 lead into the seventh, but closer
Jeff Bruksch surrendered a grand-slam
home run to the first batter he faced in fresh
man Brian Barden. It was Barden's second
