# Men's golf takes sixth place, looks toward Regionals
## Golf team falters after strong start at the U.S. Intercollegiate tourney 
### MATT LONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Saturday evening, after a driz
zling two rounds of play at Stan
ford Golf Course, the No. 23
Stanford men's golf team ap
peared poised to attack the lead
ers and snatch the title with a
strong round Sunday.
But the rain washed away
Stanford's hopes in the final
round.
The Cardinal came up against
one of its worst rounds of the
year, walking away from the U.S.
Intercollegiate with its second
sixth-place finish in as many tour
naments. The Intercollegiate
marked the last regular season
play for the team, already having
earned a berth in the NCAA West
Regional, which starts May 16.
Saturday, the Cardinal re
gained some of the form it lacked
at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships two weeks ago. It
shot three over par in the morn
ing round, led by junior Alex
Aragon's two under 69 and junior
Eric Dahlberg's 70.
Stanford commenced after
noon play trailing leader Pepper
dine by three strokes, and con
cluded the day with a six over
performance, behind freshman
Jim Seki's even par, good enough
to round out the day in third
place. The squad wasjust six shots
behind Pepperdine and trailed
eventual champion California by
only two strokes.
Stormy weather continued to
hang over the course in Sunday's
final round, and the clouds cast a
definite gloom upon the Cardi
nal's score. A 22 over par was high
enough to allow three teams to
move up, leaving Stanford in
sixth place, spinning in a whirl
wind of bogeys and 28 strokes be
hind the Golden Bears. Once
again Seki and Dahlberg paced
the team, but their 75s were just a
shadow of the exceptional golf
each had played the day before.
"We had a bad round," said

head coach Wally Goodwin. "You
have to discount it because we
played well in the other two
rounds. We didn't play well as a
team in the final round."
Dahlberg led individually,
ending up ten strokes behind the
medallist, Cal's Han Lee, and in a
three way tie for ninth place, his
best-ever finish. Recently,
Dahlberg has played extremely
well, posting the top individual
finish at the Pac-lOs for the Car
dinal.
"Dahlberg is mentally tough,"
said Goodwin. "He does not give
an inch to anyone. Without an 8
on the par 3 [hole 8] he would
have been at one under [par] for
the day."
Goodwin calls Seki the "shin
ing spot" on the team right now as
he continues to "get better and
better and better" as the postsea
son approaches. The freshman
finished in 24th place, and looks
for improvement.
"I have to be more patient,"
said Seki. "I was getting frustrat
ed this week. It was one of those
weeks where nothing was work
ing for me or for the team. We
should have won. We had home
course advantage and we can put
up the scores, but we didn't put it
together."
Both coach and players carry
high expectations going into the
Regional tournament, which will
be held at Riverbend Golf Course
in Madera. 27 teams will play in
the Regional, nine of whom will
advance to the NCAA National
Championships.
"We continue to look at what
has been our goal the whole time
making it to the National Cham
pionship," said Goodwin.
The lineup for the Regional is
to be determined by a 54-hole
qualifier taking place this week
end. Six players will have the op
portunity to play, and competi
tion for the last spots promises to
be extremely fierce.
Senior captain Dusty Brett re
cently garnered an All Pac-10
Honorable Mention Award, the
first of his career. He will lead
Stanford into the Regional with
