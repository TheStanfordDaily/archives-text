## AndroGel cream revives steroid health concerns

Even if you were never a regular of
WWF's hour of sweaty, pseudo-Speedo be
decked male wrestlers, you probably knew
the name: Hulk Hogan. Hogan, famous for
wresting a scanty yellow tank top from his
well built upper torso, later surprised many
fans of the wrestling world by admitting he
had taken steroids. Unfortunately, Hogan's
use of these drugs is but one part of a grow
ing trend found largely among men today to
use testosterone or testosterone-related sup
plements for the pin pose of improving ath
letic ability or physical appearance.
Testosterone is a hot topic. For years the
hormone has been derided as the quintes
sential root of male aggression and used to
explain, for example, why men sleep
around, drive too last, bellow, and start
street fights and civil wars. Until recently,
talk about testosterone was just talk. Then
the Illinois-based company Unimed Phar
maceuticals announced that its easy-to-apply
testosterone ointment AndroCiel will be gen
erally available for the first time by prescrip
tion this summer.
AndroCiel is easy-to-apply because in con
trast to current methods of testosterone
treatment, which dictate a synthetic version
to be self-injected every one to three weeks,
AndroCiel can be smoothed into the skin like
coconut suntan lotion. And not only do the
needles disappear, Unimed also promises

that their product won't cause the roller
coaster of emotional and physical effects —
from a burst of energy, snappishness, and li
bido in the first few days to depression —
that shots and patches tend to do.

things you should know. What exactly can
the hormone do for you? ID vou? What are
the risks involved? One reason why testos
terone eludes our comprehensibility is that
conclusive data on it remains scarce:
" I hough testosterone was first isolated in
1935," wrote Richard l.acavo in the April 24
edition of lime magazine this year, "hor
mone-replacement therapy is one ol the few
areas of medicine where research on men
lags behind that on women."
What we do know, however, is that testos
terone is ;i member of the family of male sex
hormones called androgens. I hese hot -

women in (lie adrenal
glands and ovaries —
hut men produce

On average,

the healthy male has
about 200 to 1,000 nanograms of testos
terone per deciliter of blood plasma
while in women the range is between 1 .">
and 70. But because men absorb testos
terone with varying levels ol effective
ness—some, lor example, have more re
ceptors around their bod\ that absorb
it—a man at the lower end of the normal
range can still have enough testosterone
to function normally.
But as a new book reveals, men with
completely healthy levels of testosterone
