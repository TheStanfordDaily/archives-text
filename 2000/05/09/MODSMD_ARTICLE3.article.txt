In an open Ibi um held vcsterdav <tithe I laas ( enter
l<ii Public Service, students and lacultv inel Victor
Rubin, one of the candidates for I lu* (enter's director
ship.
Rubin, cm renth directoi of I ni\ersit\ Operations
at I (1-Berkelev. said that his main role at the I laas( '.en
ter would be to engage the (at ult\. students and the
eonununitx at large in a common cause.
"The I laas (enter should not he seen as merel) a
cleat ing house of 10 or .")() dillerent ac ti\ ities." he said,
emphasizing the need I< >t a cohesive sense ol \ ision.
I he search has been unclerwa\ since |anuar\ and
has been nan <»wc<l down to two candidates: Rubin, di
rectoi ol I Diversity Operations .M I ( Berkeley, and
Nadinne (ru/, the current interim director for the
I laas (enter.
Kvcn though he lacked the "single-inincledness and
the ohsessi\e-(ompulsiveness that a researcher needs."
Rubin said that his open-mindedness and ahilitx to as
similate diverse \ iewpoints would be an asset as the di
rector.
Rubin identified three phases that the I laas (lentei
had undergone since its formation. During its first
phase, in the 'SOs, the center was a pacesetter lor getting
students involved in publi< sen ices and teaching them
how to he responsible citizens.
During the second phase, the (enter — in conjunc
tion with the 1 nivei sitv — was a pace setter lor sen ice
learning. Rubin added that although the I diversity still
has room to grow in this respect .its principles and prac
tices in the field are well-established.
I he third and final phase the Rubin cited was the
I laas Center's initiatives to create and maintain part
nerships lor community building. Although Stanford
lags behind some other univei sities in the nation in this
field, it is priinarih because it is relatively new area ol
concern for the I laas (enter, said Rubin.
