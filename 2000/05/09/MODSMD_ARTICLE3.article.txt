In an open Ibi um held vcsterdav <tithe I laas ( enter
l<ii Public Service, students and lacultv inel Victor
Rubin, one of the candidates for I lu* (enter's director
ship.
Rubin, cm renth directoi of I ni\ersit\ Operations
at I (1-Berkelev. said that his main role at the I laas( '.en
ter would be to engage the (at ult\. students and the
eonununitx at large in a common cause.
"The I laas (enter should not he seen as merel) a
cleat ing house of 10 or .")() dillerent ac ti\ ities." he said,
emphasizing the need I< >t a cohesive sense ol \ ision.
I he search has been unclerwa\ since |anuar\ and
has been nan <»wc<l down to two candidates: Rubin, di
rectoi ol I Diversity Operations .M I ( Berkeley, and
Nadinne (ru/, the current interim director for the
I laas (enter.
Kvcn though he lacked the "single-inincledness and
the ohsessi\e-(ompulsiveness that a researcher needs."
Rubin said that his open-mindedness and ahilitx to as
similate diverse \ iewpoints would be an asset as the di
rector.
Rubin identified three phases that the I laas (lentei
had undergone since its formation. During its first
phase, in the 'SOs, the center was a pacesetter lor getting
students involved in publi< sen ices and teaching them
how to he responsible citizens.
During the second phase, the (enter — in conjunc
tion with the 1 nivei sitv — was a pace setter lor sen ice
learning. Rubin added that although the I diversity still
has room to grow in this respect .its principles and prac
tices in the field are well-established.
I he third and final phase the Rubin cited was the
I laas Center's initiatives to create and maintain part
nerships lor community building. Although Stanford
lags behind some other univei sities in the nation in this
field, it is priinarih because it is relatively new area ol
concern for the I laas (enter, said Rubin.
According to Rubin, the University needs
to make decisions based on a partnership be
tween community entities and University en
tities. Each needs to work for the others mu
tual advantages in an atmosphere of mutual
respect, he said.
Rubin envisions his role primarily as a
bridge-builder and a facilitator for partner
ships. Rubin emphasized the need lor the (fil
ter to collaborate with community partners
and to "focus on a comprehensive communi
ty-"
"1 have a lot of experience as an evaluator
in the formative years of these partnerships,"
he said.
He highlighted the importance of an open,
inclusive definition of community and respect
for academic flexibility as important consider
ations for the Haas Center as it heads into the
next century.
Two other ideas that Rubin cited were the
necessity of accountability — both within the
center and between the center, the University
and the surrounding community — and the
importance of continuity to the centers mis
sion.
Rubin mentioned the need for the center
to establish "bridges [between] discontinuities
of the academic calendar" by establishing se
quences of courses that span two or three
quarters and that will be planned well in ad
vance.

I le also stated ilii' need to establish detailed
program archives so (hat students do not need
to be reoriented by service coordinators when
they begin work with a c ertain community or
ganization.
Rubin identified significant obstacles to in
creasing the interplay between the communi
ty and the University, including the decen
tralized structure of the University, the array
of specializations available in the University
and the fact that Stanford is affiliated with sev
eral competing communities and counties.
"This is what makes the job fun and inter
esting." he said.
Explaining why he wanted the position,
Rubin said that the work done at the Haas
Center "is the work that I've been doing lor
the last 30 years," and that he wanted to work
at the local level
In his concluding comments, Rubin stated
that the "thoroughness of the I laas Center is a
reflection of the culture of the place," and
that he looked forward to working in such jin
atmosphere.

for Student Affairs James Montoya. 1
