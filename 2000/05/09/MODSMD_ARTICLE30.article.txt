# Telocity speeds up slow times
## START-UP spotlight 
### CHRISTOPHER LYLE RAVI SARIN CONTRIBUTING WRITERS 
Summer will be here soon, and,
while sleeping iu late and being
away from midterms, classes and
problem sets sounds great, leaving
Stanford's last Internet connections
may not sound quite as fun. The
time you spend sitting in front of
your home computer as the modem
connects and loads a web page can
seem like an eternity.
I'atti Hart, CEO of Telocity,

thinks Telocity has the so
lution to slow load times
at home.
Co-founded by for
mer Oraduate School of
Business Prof. Peter
Olson, Telocity provides
end-to-end broadband

services to the home. Broadband is a
general term that applies to trans
mission mediums (including Digital
Subscriber Line (DSL), cable and
fiber) that can handle a large
amount of information at a time. Te
locity currently uses DSL to connect
users to the Internet because of its
speed, security and reliability.
While this market is very compet
itive, Telocity hopes to differentiate
itself by offering unique content ap
plications for consumers with broad
band access and a plug-and-play
modem for easy installation.
All this sounds great, but what
does it mean for consumers? Hart
believes that broadband is much
more than just a fast Internet con
nection: a "broadband generation of
applications" will change the way we

think about the Internet.
"Rather than looking at dimen
sionless web pages, broadband will
soon let you browse the aisles of a
bookstore or grocery store from
your computer," Hart said. "If yon
are trying to make a hotel reserva
tion, you will soon be able to tour the
rooms in three dimensions."
I liese changes are coming quick
ly, and some will even be available
before the end of the year. Hart,
however, does not think that the
broadband revolution will stop
there. In the future, new technolo
gies will provide more flexible, con
solidated services.
For example, Hart imagines a
home in which many devices, such
as telephone, television and coin-

mm g •-

puter, .ill work together to comple
ment each other. Further, this world
is ;i wireless one in which you will
have a high-speed connection any
where in the home. Any subscriber
service, liom phone, Internet, tele
vision, to even content such as news
papers, could be integrated into one
service.
(Currently, such plans are imped
ed by the lack of a übiquitous, se
cure, high-speed and wireless tech
nology. When that technology be
comes available, Telocity hopes to
facilitate the integration of con
sumer devices and content.
Hart is providing the leadership
to put Telocity in a position to take
advantage of this vision. She was re
cruited to lead the company last year
when she was serving as the Presi

dent and chief operating officer of
Sprint's Long Distance Division.
Olson, who has founded several
successful startups since he left
teaching at the (iSH in HH)9., was
one ol the people who recruited
Hart. He said he is very happy to
have I lart at Telocity.

"She has been the best
(TO 1 have ever brought
into a company," Olson
said. "She lias done a phe
nomenal j< >b."
I lart says that the busi
ness cultures are very dif
ferent in Kansas, where she

worked for Sprint, and the Bay
Area. One of the things that sur
prised her most about Bay Area
business is that most transactions are
executed without cash. Companies
often work for services-in-kind or
equity before using cash.
The pace of business has been
very fast for Telocity. They have
grown from 48 to 400 employees in
less than a year. "We have to rein
vent ourselves every 45 days to stay
on top in this industry," Hart said.
Hart has found that her gender
has not affected her reception in the
Valley. "II you can come and add
value, the technology industry em
braces you," said Hart. "Race, gen
der, age and religion are not factors.
The technology business is a true
meritocracy."
