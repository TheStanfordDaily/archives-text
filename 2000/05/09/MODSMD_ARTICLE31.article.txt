# Dinosaurs aren't as smart as you think

Hie quality that raises ;i movie villain Irom the
depths ofbeing pretty pathetic to the heights ol true
evilness is intelligence. Let's face it: watching Mel
C.ihson machine-gun his way through hordes ol
blubbering idiots wouldn't make for particularly
high-class entertainment.
It's relatively easv to make a human villain intelli
gent —just give him or her .1 lew lines ol Shakespeare
to spout and add some fiendishly clever plan that ul
timately falls just a little bit short. Alien bugs are also
prettv easv; no one's evei seen an alien bug before, si >
no one can really criticize your vision of how intelli
gent they are.
I lie problem comes when the villains are crea
tures that we KN()\V are really dumb. Sharks, for in
stance. Or birds. Sometimes the movie ("Deep Blue
Sea") invents some lnumbo-jumbo about genetic en
gineering making these dumb-as-a-post animals able
to solve complex differential equations while dutiful
ly chewing on various human body parts. Other
times, no explanation is given — those dinned crit
ters suddenly just ain't ignert no more.
Which brings us to everyone's favorite recon
struct ing-dinosaurs-Froin-frog-DNA movie, "Juras
sic Park." Nobody knows for sure how intelligent
those nastv little velociraptors really were, but does
scientific evidence suggest that they were reasonabh
intelligent, or did Michael Crichton and Hollywood
just make this stuff up to give Sam Neill an enemy to
be scared of?
One extremely scientific way in which we can ap
proach this question is to look at animals today that
superficially resemble dinosaurs, and project their
intelligence level onto their prehistoric cousins.

Like iguanas, lor instance. Iguanas kind of look
like dinosaurs, and they are certainly not regarded as
tlit' nerds of the animal world. With all due respect
lor people who have actuall) spent money on an
iguana, iguanas are the worst pets ever. As far as I can
tell. .111 iguana's lile consists ol the following activities:
1) Sitting 011 a branch.
2) Very, very occasionally, blinking.
In other words, it all of the iguanas iu the world
were to be suddenly replaced In novelty stvrofoam
iguanas, I doubt that anyone would tell the differ
ence. So based on this information, we can probablv
therefore conclude that veloc iraptors probabh
weren't 1 ()() much more intelligent than li/arcls
today.
But this evidence isn't enough for a conscientious
scientist like me. so I decided to look it up. It turns
out that veloc iraptors actually were prett\ intelligent,
lor dinosaurs. ()ne eas\ measure of intelligence is the
encephalization quotient, or F.Q. I his measures a di
nosaur's relative brain to body weight — the larger,
the better. 1 lie cretins of the dinosaur world, the
stegosauts, had an approximate F.Q ol ().(>. Veloci
raptors had .111 FQ of around ."i.S.
So, if all of the dinosaurs decided to go out to eat,
its probable that the veloc iraptors would be the ones
in charge ol figuring out the tip. But compared to
other animals sue h as birds, the F.Q of a veloc it aptor
begins to look a little less impressive. Based on rela
tive brain si/e. .i velociraptor probabh would have
been about as intelligent .is vour common ostrich.
And I have vet to see a pack of ostriches charging
their zoo cages in am kind of intelligent manner.
Another common assumption that "Jurassic Park"
makes is that the veloc iraptors hunted in packs.
However, no evidence has been found to support
this. I guess that C'richton dec ided that a movie about
a lonely dinosaur that hurtles into walls over and
over again because it is too stupid to figure out any
thing else wouldn't sell too well.
