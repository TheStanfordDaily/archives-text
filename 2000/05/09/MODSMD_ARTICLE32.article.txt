It's easy to get lost in the myriad of tech
nology startups that are springing up faster
than the California poppies that glow wild
on our roadsides. "Dot.com" culture often
provokes Luddite tendencies in your ayei -
age non-techy chap. Perhaps that
cause there are few companies founded m
Silicon Valley that are not poised on wak
ing a fast buck along with snazzy stocl op
tions. Consider an cynicism

the Monkeybin i<Hinders have a strong '
commitment to tltiniJtely funnel the suc

Students roaming around White bfaza
at the beginning of spring quirter Inay
have noticed orange monkey I lie rl or
more conspicuously, people inlipe suits
handing out bananas. These events. areng
with a three-hour open bar at the»o>ftee
House, were a part of Monkeybin's launch
of their service to die Stanford Common i A
ty on March 31.
J ustin Crable, a junior, was one of the 1N
student representatives who helped with
the launch.
"I had a great time at the Co Ho party,
and I really think the event helped get
Monkeybin's name out there," said Crable.
The service that Monkeybin introduced
at Stanford presents a novel way tor users
to trade on the Internet. The Monkeybin
Web site sets up a barter system so that
users can trade items that they no longer
need for items diat they want without using
money. So, you can post all of those Pearl
Jam CDs that you no longer want onto the
site. Then you can choose what you want in
exchange for those CDs from the items that
other people have posted.
The various "bins" or categories that the
site suggests include CDs, books, video

games, sporting goods and clothes. There
is also a miscellaneous bin, so just about
anything is (air trading game.
Monkeybin developed the site using
their barter technology and chose Stanford
as displace to introduce the site. In fact,
Bhat i.t (< >r*siders the Stanford campus to be
an ideal ground for startups.
"Stanford students think, hear and live
this new Internet economy,'' he said. "Stu
dents at Stanford know what's going on in
and diTftwi up hundreds of new

The Monkeybin site that wUs just
launched it, Stanford employs tW barter
technology Mautrmak«r. Mon

technologies like MauJuYlarfcer that are the
main focus of the company. The person-to

MatchMaker, and the company plans to
generate revenue by marketing the tech
nology to online marketplaces.
According to Bhatia, "Monkeybin is the
sole barter technology provider in the mar
ket uxlay."
The MatchMaker technology works by
asking trading parties to input what they
have and what they want. Bhatia ex
plained, "Based on that information, our
core algorithm creates a 'chain' or 'c irc le' in
an attempt to satisfy each party's trading
proposition. Ultimately, Matchmaker finds
a way to dose the circles and everyone ends
up sending their item to one party and re

ceiving their new item from another
party."
By creating these trading circles. Match
maker does not limit people to a two-way
exchange. The company's slogan, "What
do you want to trade?" holds possibilities as
infinite as lite passion and ambition that the
founders of Monkeybin are putting into
this social venture.
Bhatia alighted 011 social entrepreneur
ship early in his career, when, as a Stanford
undergraduate in Human Biology, he
iokwideci the service work-based Project
DOS I I. The project, the name of which is
jj» fjiirli word for "friendship," gives
Stanford the chance to travel to
India to participate in service projects that
focus on ecbno&iic and social develop
ment. Past projects have included per
forming street plays in slum communities
\aud rehabilitating street children in
\J unbai and Ba/igalore.

mejidiiriug his college career. "I also real
ized through the course of my work in
i'# 1 / tat 1 really wanted to help people on
an international scale in the course of rny
career."
Bhatia shares his passion for social
entrepreneur ship with the co-lbunder
of Monkeybin, Robert Chatwani, an
alumnus of DePaul University. The two
men met while working in Chicago, and
began to collaborate on an investment
strategy to combat poverty in India.
"We began working together on a so
cial investment fund focused on micro
credit organizations in India," Bhatia
said. "These organizations alleviate
poverty by lending money to poor
women to start their own small business
es.
"Robert and I both really want to in
novate in areas that, lead to social and
economic progress, such as poverty alle
viation," Bhatia said. "Ultimately, we see
our experience with Monkeybin en
abling us to be very successful social en
trepreneurs."
