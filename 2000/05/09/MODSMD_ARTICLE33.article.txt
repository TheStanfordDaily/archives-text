# TECHNOLOGY REVIEW
## GirlGeeks.com tries to inspire women 
### STEPHANIE COWLES 
Die dominance of men in the high-tech
industry is hardly big news when yon live in
Palo Alto, li s also common knowledge
among both genders out here on the Farm
that in Silicon Valley, there's ;i killing to be
made. In case women across the country
aren't ready to pick up the sl<u k on their
own, a newly launched Web site, (iirl
(ieeks.com, is eager to help women get in
on the action.
According to streaming media partner
Avid I'echnolc>gies, "(.11|( leeks exists to ed
ucate and inspire women to embrace new
technology and provide a home in cyber
space lor those who have already done so."
I he site includes much 0! what you
might expect from a site that bills itself as
"the source lor women in computing": job
listings, tutorials, Q&As, surveys and trivia.
But based on the site's look and feel, it
seems that (lirlCJeeks has adopted the atti
tude that in order to attract more women,
information technology needs a cooler
image. 1 he graphic s are done in urbanish,
neo-retro hipster style, and all the photos
are distorted with limk\ color tinting that
makes even the geekiest (lirK leeks look
c hic . I here's even a Seventeen Magazine
style (lirKleek qui/ that will categorize vour
geekiness into one of nine geek-levels, from
"(leekasaurus Rex to "(leccckk!"
Despite the noble ambition, it isn't at all
obvious that (lirl(leeks is breaking new
ground by launching this site.
(iirKieeks.com isn't theonh site catering to
women (see women.com, ivillage.com, oxy
gen.com, c vbergrrl.com), nor is it the onlv
site catering to tech professionals
(techies.com, tradespeak.com and many
others). It isn't even the only site ibr women
who are interested in technology (wirecl
woman.com), or the onlv site meant to
highlight a larger movement or organiza
tion (sfwow.org, witi.org). The main distin
guishing characteristic ol (iirKleeks.com is
the fact that it wants to appeal to all women

ol all ages, interests and technical persua
sions to create a warm, supportive "cyber
sistah" community of I I professionals.
I'he prominent spokesperson and vi
sionary for GirlCieeks.com is co-founder
Kristine Hanna. In a Washington Post in
terview lasi year she explained, "what we
are showing in (>irl( ieeks is that women will
have much more power if they create the
programs and the technology themselves
instead of just applying what others have
created."
Manna's background is primarily in TV
and film, and she is not shy about sharing
her plans for where (iirKieeks is going. She
touts (iirKieeks.com as one of a myriad of
nationwide media events still in the works,
ranging from TV, Web and radio program
ming, to books, seminars and games.
Out of generosity, 1 will concede that be
vond the fluff and sickly mint green back
ground wallpaper, this site shows some
modicum of promise. It could potentially
oiler a uniquely supportive environment
for women who are intimidated by technol
ogy and underconlident about their own
abilities. A supportive forum would be a
great resource for any frightened beginner,
since the first few stupid newbie questions
are the hardest to ask. no matter what your
gender. Further, though many similar sites
have newsletters and chat groups, Girl
(ieeks works hard to highlight what it has to
offer in the way of "mentoring" for aspiring
IT professionals. By filling out a short ques
tionnaire, registered users of (iirKieek.com
can be placed into e-mail groups led by a
"mentor" who matches their interests.
I here are an impressive number of promi
nent women on the list of mentors, which
could mean a lot to a woman with few con
nections who wanted to build a career.
If you are interested in debating the ad
vantages of DSL vs. ISDN, or your Perl
script won't work because you can't get
vour sockets to connect, I should warn von
