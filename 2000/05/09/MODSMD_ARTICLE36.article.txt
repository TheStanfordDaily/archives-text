# Hay fever wrecks havoc during midterm frenzy

### WIN T. HAN 
Although many may consider it to be a nuisance
rather than a clinically significant health problem, hay
fever is responsible for $(> billion annually in health
care costs in the I Sand is a liccjiicnt cause of absence
or poor performance at work and school.
I lay fever is the lilili most prevalent chronic condi
tion in the United Slates, and more than 25 million
people suffer from it.for unknown reasons, its preva
lence is rising, especially in urban areas and among
young people.
In spite <>1 its name, hay fever is not due to contact
with hay and is unrelated to having a lexer. It is an al
lergic response to airborne particles like pollen from
weeds, flowers, grasses, and trees, and substances like
mold, dust mites, tobacco smoke, and animal dander
(tiny scales or particles derived from hair, leathers, or
skin). Other names lor lia\ lever include "seasonal al
lergic rhinitis," and "pollinosis."
I lay lever season can be a different time of year lor

different people depending on
the cause of allergy. I hose living
in eastern and midwestern I nit
ed States who are allergic to
pollen from elm, maple, birch,
and poplar ma\ suffer in lin
early spring when these trees

product' pollen. Ragweed causes the most hay fever
and flourishes from midsummer to late fall. Approxi
mately hall ol ;ill li;i\ fever suflerers are sensitive to
grass pollens and produce s\ mptonis in the late spring
and earl)' summer, when most grasses are pollinating.
For those who are sensitive to pollens in more than
one of these groups, their hay lever season may last
from earl}' spring to late tail. I hose who are allergic to
materials other than pollen, such as dust mites and an
imal dander, ma\ Miller all war round if such sub
stances are unavoidable.
Symptoms ol ha\ level include repeated and pro
longed snee/ing; a stnlh and watcn nose; redness,
swelling, and itching ol the eyes; itching ol the nose,
throat, and mouth; itching of the ears or other ear
problems and breathing dilliculties at night due to
nasal obstruction.
Symptoms range from mild to severe lor different
individuals. When they are severe, they may be both
uncomfortable and c rippling, alicc ling performance at
daily tasks, work, and school. I Melt untreated, hay lever
symptoms could result in ear inlec lions, c hronic sinus
infections, and asthma.
All hay fever symptoms are produced b\ the body's

own immune system. When the allergen, or allergy
causing substance, reacts with a class of antibodies (im
munoglobulin E) produced by immune cells known as
mast cells and basophils in the bloodstream, these im
mune cells release histamine and other chemical sub
stances that are responsible for hay fever symptoms.
Control of hay fever begins with minimizing expo
sure to the allergen. Exposure may be lessened by
keeping doors and windows c losed in the home and car
and by using air purifying devices. Perennial allergic
responses may be ameliorated by removal of pets from
the home and dust and mold control measures.
Various medications are used to relieve symptoms.
Most drugs bloc k immune cells from releasing c hemi
cals or inhibit the effects of the chemicals. Examples of
such drugs include antihistamines, nasal deconges
tants, nasalcrom nose sprays, nasal or oral corticos
teroids, eye drops, and salt water nose drops.
Use of antihistamines often cause drowsiness, but
this usually disappears after taking them on a regular
basis. Currently, there are newer antihistamine drugs

wliich are effective and do not
cause drowsiness in most people.
Nasal decongestants and over
the-counter nose sprays may ini
tially help alleviate symptoms but
may also make them worse after
prolonged use. Prescribed corti-

costeroids are usually very effective. Ultimately, what
drug or combination of drugs works best varies with
each individual.
For those hay fever victims who respond poorly to
medication, immunotherapy may be an option, lm
munotherapy consists of receiving prolonged courses
of injections of allergen extracts. A course of therapy
involves at least six months of injections at two to six
week intervals, resulting in reduced sensitivity to the al
lergen, which leads to symptomatic improvement.
A study published last year by Durham et al. in the
New Fngiand Journal of Medicine found that the clin
ical benefit of this therapy persists at least three years
following discontinuation of treatment. However, re
cipients of immunotherapy have a risk of developing
an acute allergic response to the treatment, and moni
toring of patients lor an hour after each injection is
usually recommended.
