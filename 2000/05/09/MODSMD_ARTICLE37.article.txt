### SUMMER BARGHOUTI 
Almost every traveler who has Mown on a plane
has experienced delays. Unfortunately, with an in
crease in the volume of people flying, these delays
are only increasing in number. By creating an air
traffic control system that would be automated in
stead of manual, Aeronautics and Astronautics Prof.
Claire Tomlin is working with seven students to
help solve this problem.
in 1998 alone, more than 4()(),()()() airplanes took
off and landed in San Francisco Airport, according
to airport records. That works out to be about a
flight taking off'or landing every minute. SFO isn't
even the busiest airport in the country. It ranked
only fifth in the nation in 1998 for the amount of
passengers served — 20 million — which left it 15
million below Atlanta's 35 million, according to the
FAA. That's almost 100,000 passengers boarding a
plane daily in just one airport.
'l'his increase in numbers is causing a lot of strain
on the system, especially for air traffic controllers.
From take-off to landing, air traffic controllers are
responsible for every aspect of a safe flight. Fach
controller oversees a specific chunk of airspace;
when an airplane enters his or her space, an air traf
fic controller directs it so it doesn't get dangerously
close to any other planes in the same airspace while
still staving on course. With a greater density of
planes in the sky, ii is harder and harder for air traf
fic controllers to maintain the same level of efficien
cy and safety, causing longer holding patterns and
creating more delays.
Today, traffic controllers on the ground react to
radar inputs and guide the planes safely t( > their des
tinations manually. On average, each aircraft traffic
controller can only keep track of a maximum of 18
planes. 1 he increase in the number of planes is mak
ing each handler's job almost impossible.
Tomlin, who is a control theorist, is working on a
way to automate the system so that eventually com
puters in the traffic control center can communicate
with computers on the planes, telling them where to
go and what to do. Bv using mathematical models to
predict system behavior, Tomlin's group is design
ing collision avoidance algorithms for these com
puters, creating an automated conflict detection
and resolution system for planes.
This system involves two components: the Glob
al Positioning System and a wireless data link. A new
navigation system for air traffic control, GPS will be
installed on the planes, replacing the ground-based
navigation sensors. While new to aircrafts, GPS is
used for many purposes already. For example,
many luxury cars that give the driver directions use
GPS. The other component, the wireless cominuni

cation link, will Ik- used for receiving and transmit
ting signals between planes.
Imagine two planes heading toward a potential
collision. With this new system, the (iPS on each
plane will sense its position. Using the data link, it
will tell the other plane where it is. Then, based on
the information transmitted, each airplane will de
sign a maneuver to resolve the situation and end the
"conflict."
Presently, the majority of Tomlin's research is
focused on creating maneovers— Protocol Based
Maneuvers — that will end the conflict. She and
her team are working on designing algorithms
that can anticipate any possible conflicts and
come up with maneuvers that will solve the prob
lem.
Many of these maneuvers are inspired by the be
havior of cars driving around traffic c irc les com
monly found in London. The situation where two
planes heading toward the same point is parallel to
two cars approaching the same traffic circle. These
two cars merge onto the circle at different points and
exit at different times therefore never colliding. Pro
fessor I bmlin is working on creating similar pal
terns in the sky to avoid collisions between two
planes.
Because there is no smooth transition from pure
algorithm to experience, l omlin and her students
have been working to create realistic models and
simulate possible conflicts. In one model, the com
puter simulates what conflicts ten aircrafts flying at
random will encounter. This simulation not only
identifies potential problems but also serves as a test
bed lor possible solutions.
Another model tests parallel landing specifically.
Many airports have built parallel runways to in
crease the number of possible landings and take
offs. I laving two runways proved to be ineffective
during inclement weather, however, because there
is too much risk for planes to use both runways. This
model focuses on ways to use (iPS to make parallel
landing during inclement weather safe. II planes are
able to detect their position as well as the position of
other planes, then they will be able to land on the
correct runway without colliding into another land
ing plane.
The models aren't reserved for computer testing
only, l'lie lab also has two model planes that Tomlin
and her team are gutting and installing with the rel
evant technology. Having actual planes will allow
them to test communication between planes as well
as possible maneuvers.
The perfection of these models will be a step to
ward improving the delays and and hassles of living
today.
