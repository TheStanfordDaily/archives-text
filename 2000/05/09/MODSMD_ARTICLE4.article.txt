Sexual assault is a sei i< >us issue on college
campuses, and Stanford is no exception.
1 w<> incidences ol sexual assault wet e te
centk reported to Stanford polite, but the
majoi il\ ol sexual assaults go unreported.
"It's alwavs an undcrrcported crime,"
said S.ilh Baircl, directo) of Sexual \ssault
l'ieventi(>n at Stanlbi d.
I lie American Medical Association in a
I 00") report ( ailed sexual.iss.mil "a silent-vi
olent epidemic V cording to the AM A, "It
is generalh accepted that less than half ol
rapes are reported to authorities; some esti
mates are as low as 10 percent."
Most estimates claim that one in lout -col
lege women are sexualh assaulted while at
college.
A sillcl\ conducted h\ the Stanford Rape
I- ducat ion Project in I OSS found that 20 per
cent ol undergraduate and M percent of

graduate women .it Stanford have experi
enced .11 least one incident of sexual coer
(i<>ii.
Men have also been the victims of sexual
assault. I he same sttuh found that 10 per
cent ol undergraduate and 10 percent of
graduate men at Stanford were the victims of
sexual (oercion.
Junior Jill I >i( .iovanni said that sexual as
sault at Stanford is "a ver\ seric >us problem."
She said that it is difficult for students to be
certain that what tlu'\ have experienced is
rape because so often I hex know the perpe
tratot
" It's a ver\ gre\ issue because a lot of what
goes on .it Stanford is acquaintance t ape, so
there are difficulties in deciding w hat is sex
ual assault, 1 )i( >iovanni said.
I he Mid-IVninsula Y\V(!A Rape ( risis
(enter c iled the estimate that SO pen cut of
rapes are committed l>\ an acquaintance of
the victim.
Ihe Stanford policy defines
sexual assauli as "any unwanted
physical contact of a sexual na
ture. whether In an ac cjiiaintance
or In .1 stranger, thai occ ui s with
out indie alion of consent ol both
individuals, or that occurs under
tin cat or c oerc ion.
While assaults c an include vio
lence. mail) students are not
aware that assault c an occur with
out force if a person is not able to
indicate consent.

I nder California law and
Stanford policy, consent to en
gage in sexual ac tivity cannot be
given while a person is intoxicat
ed by drugs or alcohol. I hat
means that any time a person is
engaged in sexual contact with a
person who is intoxicated, they
are legally committing sexual as
sault or rape.
Baiicl, who heads prevention
programs at Stanford such as self
defense classes and the freshman
targeted Real World Program,
said that alcohol use "is highly
correlated" to increased inci
dences of sexual assault, "because
people take more risks, and
maybe not well thought out risks.
"You could have a one-night

situation and it could have life
time consequences," she said.
Sophomore Erin Aronson said
that many students do not realize
the prevalence of sexual assault at
Stanford. "I definitely think sexu
al assault is a huge problem every
where. and Stanford is no differ
ent from any other university.
"It's sad that people would
think that Stanford would be any
different from anywhere else, be
cause people are people."
On Thursday, May 18 the
Coalition Against Sexual Assault
is heading "Take Back the
Night," a march for awareness of
sexual assault and its victims.
They will also have a display in
White Plaza starting May 15.
Science is an important cultural achievement,
and it's nice to see it acknowledged as such.
