### SCOTT DORFMAN STAFF WRITER 
As America's largest shoe manufac
turer and supplier <>l equipment to
collegiate athletic programs, the Nike
Corporation has come to expect a lot
ol publicitx and recognition on cam
puses nationwide.
However, in recent months Nike
lias been forced to respond to negative
publicity both at Stanford and other
universities, as student groups have
put Ibrth allegations ol substandard
working conditions and wages for
Nike employees.
(lontroversy in recent weeks has sur
rounded Nike's adversarial relation
ship with the Workers Rights Consor-

Hum, an anti-sweatshop activist group
that was set up to couuiei the \ikr
sponsored Fail Labor Vssociation.
Supporters of the consortium s,t\

sa\ the consortium goes too lar in ask
ing Nike to adopt the- group's "living
wage" standards, which are usualh

Last Thursday, Nike pulled out ol
its contract renegotiation with the I Di
versity of Mi( liigan alter the univei sii\

In April. Nike (TO Phil Knight
pledged to cease all future donations
to his alma mater, the 1 nivcrsitv of

Oregon, following the I nivcrsitv\ de
(isii in to join the c onsoi lium.
" I d accept the I nivei sii\ of ()re

turers and theii einplovees in un

businesses are being monitored and
no independence," Knight said in a
press release.
At Stanford,reaction to Nike's labor
policies and the contro\cts\ with the
worker's consortium has been mixed.
Nike supportei s claim the conipam
lias done nittcli to improve wot king
conditions Ibi einplovees. and that an

association with the compam greath
benefits Stanlbrd.
"Nike reallv has taken a lead in tin
indiistr\ in terms of improving lahoi
conditions." said men's tennis toad
I )i( k (ion Id. "Students need to realize
that \ike is (in tenth doing more to;
its workers than am other athletii
eoinpam and most manufacturing
companies. Am [company] whos<
shoes or shorts we wear will have prod
iK is made in Asia. If we pull out o
Nike, we will be forced to go with an
othci company, and then another
until < >111 plavers are playing naked.
I have 110 patience with people s(
h\ poet itieal that the\ continue to ust
products, such as electronics and
clothing, made in Asia under
much more questionable condi
tions than Nike, while complain
ingabout Nike. I am at peace with
what Nike is doing."
Gould cited Nike's "commit
ment to raising minimum wages,
controlling and reducing environ
mentally toxic substances in their
products and providing schooling
for employees" as examples of the
company's dedication to its labor
force.
"We get a lot of the equipment
for our student athletes from
Nike," said Athletic Director Ted
Leland. "Much of this is equip
ment our athletic department
could not afford otherwise. In
terms of social responsibility is
sues, the University has hundreds
of thousands of corporate rela
tionships. I think Stanford has
committed to be a responsible
partner."
Classics Prof, Rush Rehm dis
agrees with Gould and Leland's
assessment of Nike, saying the
company's labor policy is "about
as good as the people watching it."
"Nike is built upon cheap labor

and expensive marketing," said
Rehm. "It appears they have
stopped using child labor, but if
watchdogs turn their backs to
morrow, Nike would continue the
practice. In terms of paying work
ers, look at all the profits Nike
makes and where those profits go.
No one who makes Nike shoes
can afford to buy them.
"It is disgusting the way Stan
fiord has gone the way of all flesh
in terms of getting corporate
sponsorship. I walked by the
track this morning, saw all the
swooshes, and thought to myself,
'Stanford University, brought to
you by Nike.' The Athletic De
partment is always crying poor,
but with sufficient outside invest
ment from alumni, corporate
sponsorship with Nike is unneces
sary," Rehm said.
Coterminal student in Manage
ment Science and Engineering
Shubha Chakravarty, who in
March toured a number of Nike
factories with a student group at
the request of Nike, said that Nike
has made improvements in labor
conditions but emphasized that
much more could be done, espe
cially with the support of the con
sortium.
"The factory condition I wit
nessed indicated some commit
ment by Nike, but it doesn't go far

enough," said Chakravarty.
"Workers don't feel they are
being paid enough, and harass
ment exists on the job. As of now,
there is no grievance procedure
for employees to protest their
conditions. Nike has said they
don't want to be a 'complaint cen
ter.' "
"I would love to see Stanford
join the WRC. 1 feel that the WRC
is bringing important issues of
monitoring into the public forum.
Unfortunately, if the issue of join
ing the WRC ever comes up, I
fear that the decision will not be
made based on what are the bfest
labor standards, but on losing $30
million from Nike sponsorship,"
added (Chakravarty.
A decision on joining the con
sortium is not being discussed
among the Board of Trustees and
will likely not be before Nike's
contract is re-negotiated, so it ap
pears that the relationship be
tween Stanford and Nike will con
tinue for the foreseeable future, a
fact that pleases Nike.
"We feel very fortunate to have
an association we have with S/t;|n
ford," said Kit Morris, head of
Nike's collegiate licensing depart
ment. "They set very high stan
dards in athletics and academics,
compatible with the standards
that we set."
