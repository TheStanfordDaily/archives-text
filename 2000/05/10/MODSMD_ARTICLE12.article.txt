The search for stylish headwear started
on the Farm long before the era of the
backwards baseball cap and the bike hel
met.
"The outcome of the Freshmen's long
search fora suitable hat to wear when they
attain the dignity of sophomoric standing
must be regarded with satisfaction by the
entire university.
"By the action of the first-year men the
pretty, gray-banded hat has practically
been established as the headgear of every
Stanford Sophomore hereafter, as the plug
marks the Junior and the sombrero the Se
nior.
"For this the credit must be given to the
present Freshmen rather than to the first
wearers of the serviceable bonnet, for it
takes courage in a freshman class to accept
what its immediate predecessors as fresh
men have done."
The Bottom Line: We've always been a stylin'
school.
