w w With tuition soaring to more
than $35,000 next year, an advertise
ment in The Daily Northwestern
gives Northwestern University stu
dents a creative option for financing
their education. The Center for Egg
Options Illinois, Inc. offers a $ 5,000
compensation for students who "give
the gift of life to an infertile couple"
by donating an egg. Although the
money is an incentive, many students
consider the impact of egg donation
as affecting more than their wallets.
' 1 Weinberg Sophomore Erin Baker
said she would not consider becoming
an egg donor, but she believes it is a
personal choice. Teri Royal, registry
director of OPTIONS National Fer
tility Registry, a company who adver
tised for egg donors in a Stanford
University newspaper, said egg dona
tions are an important option for in
fertile couples.
