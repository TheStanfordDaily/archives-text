## Shift occurs in Mexico's presidential campaign coverage 
### 
MEXICO CI I'V (AP) — I wo months
ago, when Mexico's presidential election
campaign kit keel into lull gear, the coun
try s 210 news programs were devoting a
fairly even amount of time to each of the
three main candidates.
But by April, a shift had oa lined: Sud
denly the candidate of the ruling Institu
tional Revolutionary Party, which has held
the presidency for 71 y ears, was getting half
the coverage.
I he change came just as polls began
showing opposition candidate Vicente Fox
closing in fast on ruling party candidate,
Franc isco I abastida.
"from one month to another we see this

sharp difference," said Am no Sanchez,
president of the electoral institute's media
monitoring commission, which detected
the shift.
"Why is this so alarming? Because we
assumed that we had made great advances
over the elections of 1994 and 1997 .. .We
thought that this presidential election was
going to be different," Sanchez said.
The electoral institute and its media
monitoring are among numerous reforms
adopted over the past decade to try to clean
up an election system long marred by alle
gations the PRI bought votes, stuffed ballot
boxes, showered voters with gifts and
manipulated press coverage.

Its monitoring showed that from niicl-
February to mid-March, radio newscasts —
the major source of information for mam
Mexicans — devoted about a third of their
coverage to the ruling parly. In the follow
ing month, that percentage rose to 50 per
cent.
Over the same period, the center-right
National Action Party saw coverage drop
from lil percent to2l percent. I imedevot
ed to the c enter-left Democratic Revolution
Party fell from 27 percent to 17 percent.
l he results "show a clear c hange of pol
itics on the part of the media," said Jacque
line Peschard, a board member of the 112 ed
eral Electoral Institute..

"'l'his is what is worrisome."
Opposition parties claim government
pressure is behind the shift.
"It's a damage-control operation the
PRI is doing after its candidate dropped
suddenly in the polls," said Jesus Ramirez,
an analyst with the Democratic Revolution
Part). '"I'he state controls the media con
cessions .. . and also government advertis
ing, a strong source of income for main
media."
Sandra Fuentes, labasticla's director of
international affairs, denied any govern
ment meddling, and said increased cover
age merely reflects stepped-up campaign
ing In labaslida.

(ihosts of the political past surfaced in
ilie state of Chiapas hist month, when the
I'RI governoi was caught on tape saying
local newspapers would be pressured to
report that labastida had triumphed in a
televised debate — (outran to what most
polls showed.
Hie governor denied any wrongdoing,
saying the local I'RI sent the information to
newspapers, which were free to publish
what they wanted.
Meanwhile, the electoral institute has
had difficulty running public service
announcements encouraging voter par
ticipation and telling how to help prevent
fraud.
