BANDAACEH, Indonesia (AP)
â€” In a landmark human rights
trial, 13 soldiers admitted yester
day that they dragged 26 injured
student activists into a field and
shot them to death in Ateli
province, but argued they should
not be punished because they were
following orders.
One defendant, Lt. TrijokoAdi
wiyono said when he questioned
the order to shoot the students in
the field, he was slapped by his
commander, Lt. Col. Sudjono.
"He might have shot me if I
had rejected bis order," Adiwiy
ono testified. Sudjono is still at
large.
I he students were killed when
300 soldiers swept through Beu
tong Ateuh in Wes?Aceh in
operation aimed at capturing
Terigku Bantaqiah, a former
political prisoner and preacher at
a remote Islamic boarding school.
I be prosecution is seeking
murder convictions and the death
penalty against the 25 defendants
in the trial presided over by five
military and civilian judges.
I be 13 soldiers told how they
were ordered to take the students
injured in the assault on their
boarding school to a field and
execute them.
The unprecedented trial in
Aceh was launched in April by
Indonesian President Abdurrah
man Wahid to reach out to the
separatist forces in the province
in northwestern Indonesia and to
continue his efforts to reduce the
military's power.
The trial for the murders is
regarded as a test of the new gov
ernment's resolve to rein in the
military, which committed
numerous human rights abuses
in Aceh during the dictatorship of
ex-president Suharto.
