Sierra Leone (AP)"*-*-" United
Nations peacekeepers, followed by frightened
refugees, have retreated from a key village outside
this West African capital, U.N. officials said yester
day, while regional leaders met in Nigeria in an
effort to defuse the week-old c risis threatening to
push Sierra Leone once again into c ivil war.
The peacekeepers withdrew from Masiaka, 45
miles east of Freetown, on Monday after exc hang
ing gunfire with unknown attackers and running
out of ammunition, U.N. spokesman David
Wimhurst said. Word of the retreat did not reach
Freetown for more than 24 hours.
While rebels of the Revolutionary United Front
are believed to be in the region, it was unclear if
they were responsible. Helicopter reconnaissance
showed the city was completely empty yesterday
afternoon. Wimhurst said, but added: "Freetown is
not going to fall to the RUF.
In this seaside c ity, word of the fighting broad
cast over the radio quickly spread fear through the
city after what had been a peaceful yesterday
morning.
"We are so worried . . . that we heard that the
rebels had attacked Masiaka and Masiaka is so c lose
to the c ity," said Edward Moseray, a civil servant.
The disappearance of the country's rebel leader,
Foday Sankoh, added to the gloom. I le had been
under U.N. guard before Monday's shooting out

side hi*-Freetown home. I lie rumor mill had
Sankoh anywhere from the Sierra Leonean jungle
to an army salehou.se, Imi U.N. officials said they
did not know where he was.
Ibe situation in Sierra Leone has become
increasingly chaotic since a Nigerian-led regional
intervention force pulled out last week. Since then,
clashes have broken out intermittentlv between
peacekeepers and rebels and some 500 peacekeep
ers are being held hostage bv the Rl F. At least one
peacekeeper is believed to be dead.
In Abuja, Nigeria, presidents from around the
region met to trv to defuse the crisis. I hey con
demned the recent rebel moves but fell short of
ordering additional troops into Sierra Leone.
Instead, they called fora ministerial summit to be
held next week in Nigeria to discuss the possibility.
A statement issued afterward and signed In nine
presidents from the region said thev "expressed
their determination to use all means at their dis
posal, including the military option, to loil any
attempt to take over power through the use of
force."
A senior U.S. administration official, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said the United States
had sent a "fact-finding" team to Nigeria on Mon
