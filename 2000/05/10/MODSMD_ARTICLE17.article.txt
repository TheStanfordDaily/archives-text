# Jews and Palestinians are genetically linked
## 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Tradi
tion says the biblical patriarch
Abraham fathered both the Jew
ish and Arab nations.
Now, new DNA-based
research reveals a genetic link
between Jews and Palestinians,
suggesting the two peoples,
locked in <i bitter struggle for
more than a century, indeed
share a common ancestry dating
back 1.000 years.
The study, published yester
day in"The Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences" in
Washington, D.C., says the Y
chromosome found in Jewish
men may go back to a common
pool of Middle Eastern ancestors.
After the first major Jewish
exile of 58G 8.C., when Jews dis
persed across Europe and North
Africa, Jews largely retained their
genetic identity, one that was
formed in the Middle East,
according to the studv, led bv
Michael Hammer of the Univer
sity of Arizona.
Even after centuries of exile.
Diaspora Jews remained closer to
each other and more similar to
Palestinians, Syrians and
Lebanese in terms of shared Y
chromosome characteristics than
to people in their host countries,
the study savs.
"Eventually people will realize
that they are not that different,"
said Batsheva Bonne-'Tamir, a
geneticist from Tel Aviv Univer
sity who participated in the
study.
Still, she cautioned that the
techniques were new and that
until the human genome is
mapped, it will be difficult to be
certain about the conclusions.
1 he study compared the male,
or Y, chromosome, which is
passed from father to son in
1,371 males from seven groups
of Israeli Jews ol various origins
and If) non-Jewish groups in the
Middle East, Africa and Europe.
Hammer identified 19 varia
tions of the Y chromosome,
including eight lineages found to
varying degrees among Jews and

Arabs.
Based on this measure, the
study found that despite the
manv centuries their ancestors
had spent in exile in different
parts of the world, the Israeli
Jews in the sample had the (los
es! genetic links.
Next in genetic affinity to Jews
were Palestinians and Syrians,
followed by Saudi Arabians,
Lebanese, and Druse, a Middle
Eastern sect that practices a
secret form of Islam.
According to the research, in
one of the lineage branches, the
percentage of variation in the Y
chromosome between Jews and
Palestinians differed by only 1
percent compared to a difference
of 5 percent between Jews and
Europeans.
A low rate of intermarriage
between Diaspora Jews and gen
tiles was a key reason for the con
tinuity, lionne-lamir said. For
example, since Jews first settled
in Europe SO generations ago,
the intermarriage rate waS' f £stU,
mated to be onh about 0.5 per
cent in each generation.
As a result, according to the Y
chromosome results, Jews of
European descent living in Israel
have closer genetic affinity to
Syrians than to the non-Jews of
the countries they came from.
Hebrew University geneticist
Howard C edar said even though
Y chromosomes are considered
the best tool for tracing genetic
heritage, researchers still don't
know what the historv is behind
the variations. As a result, it is dif
ficult to draw conclusions about
genetic affinitv.
"The problem is in the inter
pretation." Cedar said. "It's very
difficult to reconstruct the histo
ries of these events, it's difficult to
interpret."
Bonne-Tamir, who heads the
National Laboratory for the
Genetics of Israeli Populations,
said that until recently, such
research on genetic affinity was
limited to classical markers, such
as blood groups and enzymes.
