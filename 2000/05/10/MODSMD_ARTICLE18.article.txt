# Political heavyweights try to raise support for China trade deal
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — In an
extraordinary assembly of Republican
and Democratic administrations span
ning three decades, former Presidents
lord and Garter closed ranks yesterday
with President Clinton to push fora
China trade deal that appears increas
ingh likely to pass.
"We want the voice of'this meeting to
echo across the country and to embrace
the Congress," Clinton told more than
200 VIPs in the chandeliered East
Room. "I wish it weren't a fight, but it
is."
I wo weeks before the House opens
debate on granting China permanent
trade benefits, supporters of the pro
posal were optimistic about winning.
"We're confident that we will get there
on the votes," said House Majority
Leader Dick Armey, R Texas.
1 o prevail, the bill requires 218 votes
in the 43f>-meinber House if all mem
bers vote. Both sides say the vote will be

extremely close. If the I louse passes the
measure, Senate approval is likely.
Republican sponsors sav the\ expect
to deliver 140 to 145 votes — but that
Democrats must supply the rest. Demo
cratic sponsors predict the\ will get 70-
(S0 Democratic votes.
Meanwhile, two House members —
Re f js. Sander Levin, D-Mich., and
Doug Bereuter, R-Neb. — late yester
day proposed companion legislation to
set up a new procedure for measuring
China's behavior. It calls fora congres
sional-executive commission that would
monitor human rights and labor prac -
tices in China and make recommenda
tions that presumably could include
proposing sanctions.
China-trade advocates in both par
ties have said that the side package
could improve the overall prospects for
the China trade bill by providing politi
cal cover to those now on the fence.
Clinton collected support at the

White House Irom a who's who of the
foreign policy establishment from both
parties.
There were lour lormei secretaries
of state: Henry Kissinger, Alexander
Haig, James Bakei and Warren
Christopher.
Kissinger, acknowledging the
diverse views present, said some guests
"could not even charitabh be described
as colleagues." But he said, "We are
united on one proposition. Six Ameri
can presidents, of both parties, have
concluded that cooperative relations
with China serve the national interest of
the United States."
In a strong voice, Ford, KG, warned
of (lire consequences if C Congress denied
permanent trade benefits to China —
part of an agreement in which Beijing
pledged to lower trade ban iers and tar
iffs on American goods in return for
L'.S. support for China's entry into the
World I rade ()rganization.
