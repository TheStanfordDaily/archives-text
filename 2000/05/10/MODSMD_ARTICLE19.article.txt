economic agreement.
In two weeks, (iongress is set to vote on a bill

China, paving the way for China's eventual

this legislation as the administration's top for

ago led the charge to impeach the President,
but now stands as his key ally on the China
trade bill.
As was asserted earlier this week in a letter
signed by three prominent Stanford
economists, the opening of trade with China
w ill indeed be a huge boon to American eco
nomic interests, working to open potentially
lucrative markets in China through the easing
of both tariff and non-tariff restrictions.
The normalization of trade policy with
China has been a rocky path through much of

And many of the criticisms are indeed not
