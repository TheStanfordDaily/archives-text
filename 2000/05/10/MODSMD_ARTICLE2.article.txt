# NASA plans greater links with academia

NASA has announced that it will
make a greater effort to reach out to
universities and direct more funds to
campus research. Stanford, whose $50
million in contracts make it the third
largest recipient of NASA funding,
stands to benefit greatly from this new
policy.
As part of the new changes, NASA
hopes to give longer-term grants to uni
versities as well as simplify the grant ap
plication process.
For the first time in years, NASA v\ill
also work with universities to identify
promising graduate students and post
doctoral researchers. The government
research organization needs skilled
workers in engineering and informa
tion technology at a time when many
graduates are more interested in cyber
space than outer space.
"The intent to collaborate with uni
versities is now in place. The problem is
that not all of NASA is aware of the in
tention and therefore funding is tied up
in negotiations and lakes longer to ar
rive rather than shorter," said Robert L.
Byer, director of 1 lansen Experimental

Physics Laboratory. "We hope that this
difficulty is only temporary."
Laboratory faculty are now involved
in research fiÂ»r hall'ofall NASA missions
scheduled for the next decade, accord
ing to Byer.
"At present, [Stanford's] contacts
with NASA are mostly in the Hansen
Experimental Physics Laboratory, an
independent laboratory that has faculty
members and students from the De
partments of Physics, Applied Physics,
Electrical Engineering, Aeronautic sand
Astronauti( sand Mechanical Engineer
ing," Byer said.
The laboratory and faculty are work
ing on the (iravity Probe-B experiment,
set to launch in April 2002; the Gamma
Ray Large Area Space Telescope set to
launch in 2006; the Laser In Space An
tenna for measuring gravitational waves
due for launch in 2010; the Space lest
of the Equivalence Principle due to start
within the next year; and in the future,
a program called Living With a Star.
"The public statement by NASA in
February for increased collaboration
with universities reflects studies and dis
cussions by NASA and many universi
ties that began more than one year ago.

We are hopeful that NASA will take ad
vantage of partnering with universities
in future space missions." Bver said.
According to Bver, the main concern
now is whether the space science mis
sions will survive the budget process in
Congress and the missions will be sup
ported. \lthough NASA's grants are

more unreliable than private funding
because they are prone to an annual re
view, tliev are the onh feasible funding
sources lor long-duration basic science
missions.
"We work with colleagues from F.u-


SUSAN QUAN/The Stanford Daily
rope and Japan and try to obtain
matching binding where possible
to stabilize the funding of mis
sions," Byer added.
Byer said that Stanford has been
asked to form a group with other
universities that will assist NASA in
selecting science missions for the
International Spate Station. In ad
dition. Stanford has also signed an
agreement to conduct joint re
search with NASA's Jet Propulsion
I xiboratory in Pasadena, ( alii.
NASA's recent shift to launching

smaller spacecraft will probably
give universities more opportuni
ties to put their experiments
aboard satellites.
"Our students learn about the
practical aspects of space science
and engineering missions. They
are very valuable to NASA in the
NASA labs. Other students un
dertake space Might and partici
pate in the shuttle missions," Byer
said.
Charles Kruger, dean of re
search and graduate policy, is
pie ased that NASA has expressed
a desire to increase collaboration
with universities and he ex
pressed optimism about any fu
ture joint projects between NASA

and Stanford.
Stanford was selected by
NASA's Marshall Space Flight cen
ter as the primary contractor for
the entire Gravity Probe-B pro
gram. The University is responsi
ble for building the science instru
ment, and mission operations and
data analysis.
Stanford's management of the
Gravity Probe-B program marks
the first time NASA has allowed a
university to completely manage
the development and operation of
a major scientific satellite. The
program has since evolved into
the top-priority scientific experi
ment in gravitational physics for
NASA.
