# NASA plans greater links with academia

NASA has announced that it will
make a greater effort to reach out to
universities and direct more funds to
campus research. Stanford, whose $50
million in contracts make it the third
largest recipient of NASA funding,
stands to benefit greatly from this new
policy.
As part of the new changes, NASA
hopes to give longer-term grants to uni
versities as well as simplify the grant ap
plication process.
For the first time in years, NASA v\ill
also work with universities to identify
promising graduate students and post
doctoral researchers. The government
research organization needs skilled
workers in engineering and informa
tion technology at a time when many
graduates are more interested in cyber
space than outer space.
"The intent to collaborate with uni
versities is now in place. The problem is
that not all of NASA is aware of the in
tention and therefore funding is tied up
in negotiations and lakes longer to ar
rive rather than shorter," said Robert L.
Byer, director of 1 lansen Experimental

Physics Laboratory. "We hope that this
difficulty is only temporary."
Laboratory faculty are now involved
in research fiÂ»r hall'ofall NASA missions
scheduled for the next decade, accord
ing to Byer.
"At present, [Stanford's] contacts
with NASA are mostly in the Hansen
Experimental Physics Laboratory, an
independent laboratory that has faculty
members and students from the De
partments of Physics, Applied Physics,
Electrical Engineering, Aeronautic sand
Astronauti( sand Mechanical Engineer
ing," Byer said.
The laboratory and faculty are work
ing on the (iravity Probe-B experiment,
set to launch in April 2002; the Gamma
Ray Large Area Space Telescope set to
launch in 2006; the Laser In Space An
tenna for measuring gravitational waves
due for launch in 2010; the Space lest
of the Equivalence Principle due to start
within the next year; and in the future,
a program called Living With a Star.
"The public statement by NASA in
February for increased collaboration
with universities reflects studies and dis
cussions by NASA and many universi
ties that began more than one year ago.

We are hopeful that NASA will take ad
vantage of partnering with universities
in future space missions." Bver said.
According to Bver, the main concern
now is whether the space science mis
sions will survive the budget process in
Congress and the missions will be sup
ported. \lthough NASA's grants are

more unreliable than private funding
because they are prone to an annual re
view, tliev are the onh feasible funding
sources lor long-duration basic science
missions.
"We work with colleagues from F.u-
