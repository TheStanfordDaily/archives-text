Interviews, Salewa\ slops, off-campus
employment, the movies — all made
inlinitelv easier with a car.

Believe me. I understand bow idiotic
the parking crumb on campus is. Have
\oii ever tried lo find a spot alter 1 1 a.m.
with a ( permit? It's not pretty. But I
wondei how ellciiive the freshman ban
• in i ai s is reallv going lo be. Between the
ini l eased driving as moie uppert lassmen
and stall hrinu' cars, buoyed by the no

112 i ush-tars promise, and the many permits
automobile-less sophomores will buy for
their fiosh friends, 1 wonder if parking
will be just as bad next year. Or even
worse, as lots start to fill up around 8 a.m.
instead of 10 a.m.
Living off-campus, I'm one of the
proud six percent of undergraduates
who didn't have to worry about last
week's Draw — 1 worried alxmt parking
instead. And life outside of Stanford is
nice. 1 have my own room that's at least
bigger than a suites single, I get to hear
about the real world on occasion, and I
get to socialize with non-student types.
Don't get me wrong. I was actually one
of the freaky kids who liked dorm liv ing
— the constant hanging out in the
lounge, the group atmosphere, having
someone else cook for me. But as a
senior, I like being able to leave Stanford
at the end of the day and not have to live
completely enveloped in a haze of aca
demic frustration.
Yes, I do have a hot tub at the house I
rent with three other friends, but living
oil-campus is not always the perfect solu
tion — it does require certain trade-oil's.
It's extremely easy to miss class, lo even
forget you have a ( lass. And you'll proba
bly find yourselves perpetually late for
the c lasses you do attend.
You won't really broaden your social
base and your c urrent friends won't visit
you nearly as often, but you can always
join campus groups or hang out with
your friends on campus. Just make sure
you're living with people you really like
and can forgive.
And after a long day of c lasses, the last
thing you want to do is cook something
hot and nutritious. Even if you like- cook
ing, you just won't have the time to do it.
I guess if you're the type of person who
puts Mirrielies down on your Draw card,
you'd be the type who could live oil-cam
pus. (And don't even get me started on
the price of rent in the Bay Area — it's
pretty much insane.)
I lonestly, 1 know many people who go
through their lour years at Stanford with
out even thinking about getting a car or
living off-campus. It's definitely not a
necessity. And I honestly wouldn't have
as many car-withdrawal symptoms as I do
now if I lived in a dorm or had never
experienced the convenience of owning a
c ar on-campus.
I just hope the Marguerite extends its
service again soon. At least all the way
down 280.
