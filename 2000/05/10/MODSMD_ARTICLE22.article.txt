Seniors should join Alumni Association
We are responding to Dick Bullis's let
lei ("Give to class gift, not Alumni Associ
ation") in the May 8 Daily. In urging
seniors not to join the Stanford Alumni
Association, Mr. Bullis has done a disser
vice to Stanford, our fellow students and
the 75,000 alumni who are proud mem
bers of this organization and the Univer
sity family.
Not only does membership in the Stan
lord Alumni Association provide a guar
anteed subscription to Stanford Maga
zine, but it also offers a variety of other
services. Members are eligible to join the
Stanford Federal Credit Union; receive
discounts on Stanford Travel / Study pro
grams, professional education courses
and at the Stanford Sierra Camp; are
allowed access to the Stanford golf course;
participate in spec ial promotions with the
Stanford Bookstore's StanfordCiear.com
and the ASSU Stanford Store; can take
advantage of reduced membership pric -
ing with rental car and national hotel
chains; enjoy membership price reduc
tions on commemorative products, gifts
and alumni directories and benefit from
extended access to Stanford libraries. In
the next month, Class of 2000 graduates
who are members will receive a 20 per
cent discount on cap and gown or diplo
ma frames, free moving boxes and a com
plementary lunch at the pre-commence
ment Class Day Luncheon.

Importantly, membership participa
tion in the Stanford Alumni .Association
helps to support all the services provided
by the Association and its ability to engage
alumni in a lifelong commitment to Stan
ford. These ac tivities include the produc
tion of Stanford Magazine, reunion activ
ities for more than 6,000 alumni annual
ly, class and regional activities throughout
the world, on-campus student organiza
tions such as STAN, and online web ser
vices including free lifetime e-mail
accounts at stanfordalumni.org.
For more than 108 years, the Stanford
Alumni Association has existed as an
organization dedicated to offering alumni
a way to stay in touch with lifelong
friends, faculty and the University. Mem
bers are consistently found to be those
who most actively participate in Stanford
events, mentor new and graduating stu
dents and support the University
through both volunteer and philanthrop
ic generosity. Membership in the Stan
ford Alumni Association is a vehicle that
can provide every senior with a lifelong
link to the experience and the peo pie of
Stanford.
