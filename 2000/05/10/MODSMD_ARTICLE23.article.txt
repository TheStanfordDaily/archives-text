# U.N. biotechnology policy called into question
## 
### HENRY MILLER GUEST COLUMNIST 
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
recently responded to criticism that the
sanctions against Iraq were harmful to
the Iraqi people, telling the Security
Council that "the United Nations has
always been on the side of the vulnerable
and the weak, and has always sought to
relieve"suffering, yet here we are accused
of causing suffering to an entire popula
tion."
lint two recent U.N. forays into
biotechnology regulation give the lie to
Annan's remarks: the U.N.'s recent
involvement in excessive, unscientific
biotechnology regulation will slow agri
cultural research and development, pro
mote environmental damage and bring
famine and death to millions in develop
ing countries.
In Montreal in January, delegates to
the U.N.-sponsored Convention on Bio
logical Diversity negotiated a "biosafety
protocol" for the regulation of interna
tional movement of gene-spliced organ
isms. It was based on the bogus "precau
tionary principle," which dictates that
every new technology — including, in the
case of gene-splicing, a refinement of less
precise technologies — must be proven
safe before it can be used. An ounce of

prevention is certainly desirable, but
because nothing can be proved totally
safe, the precautionary principle creates
prodigious obstacles to the development
of new products.
Precaution, in this sense, shifts the
burden of proof from the regulator, who
once had to demonstrate that a new tech
nology was likely to cause some harm, to
the innovator, who now must demon
strate that the technology will not. Under
this new standard of evidence, regulatory
bodies are free to arbitrarily require any
amount and kind of testing they wish.
Thus, rather than creating a uniform,
predictable and scientifically sound
framework for effectively managing legit
imate risks, the biosafety protocol estab
lishes an ill-defined global regulatory
process that permits overly risk-averse,
incompetent and corrupt regulators to
hide behind the precautionary principle
in delaying or deferring approvals.
We have already seen the first exam
ple of the arbitrary and capricious appli
cation of the precautionary principle to
agbiotech that is directly related to the
Montreal protocol: the recent decision by
the German government to block com
mercial-scale cultivation of gene-spliced,
insect-resistant corn by the biotech com
pany Novartis. Another recent example
of the U.N.'s negative influence is a task

force of the 165-member Codex Alimen
tarius Commission, t he joint food stan
dards program of the U.N.'s World
Health Organization and Food and Agri
culture Organization, which met in
Chiba, Japan, in February to begin dis
cussions of issues related to biotechnology
and food. It began auspiciously, with
Thomas J. Billy, the temporary chairman
of the Codex (and senior U.S. Depart
ment of Agriculture official), noting that
biotechnology is merely "a new name or
label fora process people have used as
long as we have been baking bread, fer
menting wine or making cheese or culti
vating crops and breeding animals." He
alluded to the scientific consensus that
biotech is a continuum of new and old
technologies, and that modern gene
splicing techniques are "essentially a
refinement of the kinds of genetic modi
fication long used to enhance microor
ganisms, plants and animals for food."
Billy's scientific approach was not
heard from again. Instead, the group
moved deliberately toward circumscrib
ing only food products made with gene
splicing for various Draconian and even
bizarre regulatory procedures and
requirements that will impair the com
petitiveness of these products in the mar
ketplace.
1 his was precisely the agenda of many

of those assembled. Their motivations
vary. The Europeans — especially the
European Commission and France —
want to stop genetically modified prod
ucts because they are mostly made by
U.S. companies, and the radical environ
mental nongovernmental organizations,
which are permitted to participate in
Codex meetings, are ideologically
opposed to new technology. The Codex
task force is en route to codifying various
procedures and requirements more
appropriate to potentially dangerous
prescription drugs or pesticides than to
genetically modified tomatoes, potatoes
and strawberries. They include long
term monitoring for adverse health
effects and batteries of tests for genetic
stability, toxins, allergenicity and so on.
Among the most egregious is some
thing called "traceability," an array of
technical, labeling and record-keeping
mechanisms to keep track of a plant
"from dirt to dinner plate," so that con
sumers will know whom to sue if they get
diarrhea from CM prunes, and provid
ing, in the words of the anti-biotech
European Commission delegate, "a tool
governments can use to remove products
from the market."
The prospect of unscientific, overly
burdensome Codex standards for gene
spliced foods is ominous because mem

bers of the World Trade Organization
will, in principle, be required to follow
them, and they will provide cover for
unfair trade practices. These unscientific
regulations and standards actually harm
the environment and public health, sti
lling the development of environmental
ly friendly innovations that can increase
agricultural productivity, help clean up
toxic wastes, purify water and supplant
agricultural chemicals. U.N. experts
themselves warn constantly that the
greatest single threat to the planet's envi
ronment comes from the world's bur
geoning population and its demand that
ever more land be brought into food pro
duction.
Yet, an important answer — develop
ing more productive plant varieties —
will be blocked by unnecessary regulation
of gene-splicing. Morally, this is no differ
ent from permitting the building of an
unsafe dam or knowingly administering a
contaminated vaccine. The United
Nations and its secretary-general should
be held accountable.

Thomas J. Billy, the temporary chairman
of the Codex (and senior U.S. Depart
ment of Agriculture official), noting that
biotechnology is merely "a new name or
label fora process people have used as
long as we have been baking bread, fer
menting wine or making cheese or culti
vating crops and breeding animals." He
alluded to the scientific consensus that
biotech is a continuum of new and old
technologies, and that modern gene
splicing techniques are "essentially a
refinement of the kinds of genetic modi
fication long used to enhance microor
ganisms, plants and animals for food."
Billy's scientific approach was not
heard from again. Instead, the group
moved deliberately toward circumscrib
ing only food products made with gene
splicing for various Draconian and even
bizarre regulatory procedures and
requirements that will impair the com
petitiveness of these products in the mar
ketplace.
1 his was precisely the agenda of many

of those assembled. Their motivations
vary. The Europeans — especially the
European Commission and France —
want to stop genetically modified prod
ucts because they are mostly made by
U.S. companies, and the radical environ
mental nongovernmental organizations,
which are permitted to participate in
Codex meetings, are ideologically
opposed to new technology. The Codex
task force is en route to codifying various
procedures and requirements more
appropriate to potentially dangerous
prescription drugs or pesticides than to
genetically modified tomatoes, potatoes
and strawberries. They include long
term monitoring for adverse health
effects and batteries of tests for genetic
stability, toxins, allergenicity and so on.
Among the most egregious is some
thing called "traceability," an array of
technical, labeling and record-keeping
mechanisms to keep track of a plant
"from dirt to dinner plate," so that con
sumers will know whom to sue if they get
diarrhea from CM prunes, and provid
ing, in the words of the anti-biotech
European Commission delegate, "a tool
governments can use to remove products
from the market."
The prospect of unscientific, overly
burdensome Codex standards for gene
spliced foods is ominous because mem

bers of the World Trade Organization
will, in principle, be required to follow
them, and they will provide cover for
unfair trade practices. These unscientific
regulations and standards actually harm
the environment and public health, sti
lling the development of environmental
ly friendly innovations that can increase
agricultural productivity, help clean up
toxic wastes, purify water and supplant
agricultural chemicals. U.N. experts
themselves warn constantly that the
greatest single threat to the planet's envi
ronment comes from the world's bur
geoning population and its demand that
ever more land be brought into food pro
duction.
Yet, an important answer — develop
ing more productive plant varieties —
will be blocked by unnecessary regulation
of gene-splicing. Morally, this is no differ
ent from permitting the building of an
unsafe dam or knowingly administering a
contaminated vaccine. The United
Nations and its secretary-general should
be held accountable.
