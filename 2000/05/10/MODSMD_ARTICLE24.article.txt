## Kiwis' Olympic hopes riding on Card's stars 
### MEGHAN O'CONNOR STAFF WRITER 
On May 19, two of Stanford's finest men's
soccer players will swap their (Cardinal jerseys
for All Whites and abandon their quest fora
NCAA title in favor of an Olympic medal.
Senior Gerard Davis and junior Ryan
Nelsen, both New Zealand natives, return
home this week to rejoin the Under-23 Na
tional Team for the squad's final stretch of
Olympic qualifying matches. The New
Zealand All Whites will face South Africa in a
decisive two-game series — and thewinnei is
Sydney-bound.
The New Zealand squad breezed through
the first-round of qualifiers in December.
With wins over Vanuatu (4-0), Papua New
Guinea (5-0), Fiji (5-2) and the Solomon Is
lands (4-1), the team easily clinched the top
spot in the Oceania Olympic Qualifiers.
But South Africa, which finished fourth in
its qualifying series, will be a step up in coin
petition.
For Davis and Nelsen, gone are the days of
performing in front of the intimate fans at
New Maloney Field. When the squad steps
onto the high altitude field in Johannesburg,

they will be out in 112 ront of a sold-out crowd of
50,000.
"Our first game is at home, we'll have to
put in a really good performance to give us a
chance in South Africa [on May 29]," Davis
said. "It'll be a pretty tough environment to
go into."
While these two games will be the biggest
and most important that the two have seen,
neither is a stranger to international com
petition.
Both started off on the Under-20 Nation
al squad under Stanford head coach Bobby
Clark. From there, Nelsen went on to be
come one oft he youngest players on the New
Zealand Senior National l eain. He earned
valuable international experience this past
July playing against Brazil, Germany and the
United States at the Confederation Cup in
Mexico and was honored as the Royal Sun
and Alliance Young Player of the Year in
New Zealand soccer.
After stopping out last winter quarter to
participate in a training camp, Davis played
two matches with New Zealand against Aus
tralia last summer. He was then picked to

join the Under-23 Olympic team
along with Nelsen, the captain of
the squad.
"1 think they'll do well," Clark
said. "Ryan will be a leader the
way he is here and Gerard is so
technically clean and smooth —
both will be key players for the
New Zealand Olympic team."
The two have already made
their presence known as integral
to Kiwi success. Both started for
New Zealand in the Oceania qual
ifiers, and Nelsen notched a semi
final goal.
While lac k of international ex
perience may not be a factor in the
squad's upcoming matches, lack
of experience as a team might be.
With six overseas players, team

matches have been few, team
practices, non-existent.
The Oceania Olympic Quali
fiers was the team's first chance to
get acquainted. An international
tournament in China and match
es with South Korea in January
gave the team further playing
time together, but the team
wasn't complete without players
like Davis and Nelsen, who were
back at Stanford for winter quar
ter. Nor was the team all together
for its matchup with Japan in
Japan this March, a game that
both Davis and Nelsen were able
to attend.
"Everyone's on different
schedules," Davis said. "It makes
it tough on us. We'll be the un
derdogs, we need to be well-orga
nized and well-prepared."
Despite the lack of play togeth
er, pressure for the squad to be at
its best will be coming from all an

gles as the country looks to the All
Whites to pull an upset victory
that would launch New Zealand
soccer into its first Olympic ap
pearance.
"These are the biggest matches
any of us have ever played and
there's quite a bit of significance,"
Nelsen said. "Given the fact that
New Zealand is such a small coun
try, to qualify would be an amaz
ing feat."
And with the age cutoff to par
ticipate in soccer at the Olympic
level set at 23, for Davis and Nelsen
this is their one and only shot.
"You always grow up watching
the Olympics, so they have a spe
cial feel," Davis said. "It'd be great
to be a part of it."
"It would be so awesome to
represent Stanford," Nelsen said.
"It'd be a great honor to do that as
well as help promote the pro
gram."

Along with the thrill of partici
pating in soccer's biggest event be
sides the World Cup, playing in the
Olympics gives players the edge in
winning a spot on a professional
team.
"Every single scout is going to
be there. It'll be like a big shop
ping window," Nelsen said. "To
get there would help your career
after college if you get noticed."
For Davis, who graduates this
spring, the opportunity would be
invaluable as he looks to play pro
fessionally post-graduation.
Nelsen still has one more sea
son left at Stanford, and an
Olympic appearance would leave
the Cardinal squad without one
of its captains for part of next sea
son.
Both Nelsen and Davis would
be missed this fall as both have
had a significant impact on Stan
ford soccer.

As the quiet but strong captain
of this year's squad, Davis led
Stanford to a 12-5-2 record this
fall iu his last season with the Car
dinal. A defender with equally
strong offensive skills, the talent
of the versatile Davis will be
missed next season. He tallied 15
career points lor the (Cardinal and
will not be forgotten for his game
winner this season against Cali
fornia and assists on the overtime
game-winners against Santa
Clara this season and against San
Jose State last season in the first
round of the NCAA tournament.
"With Bobby, you get a pretty
good understanding of the
game," Davis said of his career
with the Cardinal. "Stanford has a
very strong professionally run
program — I think that's an ad
vantage. But when it comes to [in
ternational] games, the intensity
is so much more. It's hard to jump

into that environment."
Nelsen made an immediate
impact in his first season with the
Cardinal this fall. He garnered
All-Tournament honors at both
the Fresno Tournament and
Stanford / Nike Tournament.
The midfielder notched four as
sists and two game winning goals
against Bradley and Santa Clara,
respectively, during the season.
For his vital role in Cardinal suc
cess, Nelsen was named to the
first team Far West All-American
team at the end of the season.
"We look at it with mixed emo
tions," Clark said of New
Zealand's shot to qualify for the
Olympics. "If they qualify, we'd
be without Ryan for the first three
weeks of the season. But at the
same time, the opportunity for
both of them to get to the
Olympics is so exciting for them
and for Stanford."

es with South Korea in January
gave the team further playing
time together, but the team
wasn't complete without players
like Davis and Nelsen, who were
back at Stanford for winter quar
ter. Nor was the team all together
for its matchup with Japan in
Japan this March, a game that
both Davis and Nelsen were able
to attend.
"Everyone's on different
schedules," Davis said. "It makes
it tough on us. We'll be the un
derdogs, we need to be well-orga
nized and well-prepared."
Despite the lack of play togeth
er, pressure for the squad to be at
its best will be coming from all an

gles as the country looks to the All
Whites to pull an upset victory
that would launch New Zealand
soccer into its first Olympic ap
pearance.
"These are the biggest matches
any of us have ever played and
there's quite a bit of significance,"
Nelsen said. "Given the fact that
New Zealand is such a small coun
try, to qualify would be an amaz
ing feat."
And with the age cutoff to par
ticipate in soccer at the Olympic
level set at 23, for Davis and Nelsen
this is their one and only shot.
"You always grow up watching
the Olympics, so they have a spe
cial feel," Davis said. "It'd be great
to be a part of it."
"It would be so awesome to
represent Stanford," Nelsen said.
"It'd be a great honor to do that as
well as help promote the pro
gram."

Along with the thrill of partici
pating in soccer's biggest event be
sides the World Cup, playing in the
Olympics gives players the edge in
winning a spot on a professional
team.
"Every single scout is going to
be there. It'll be like a big shop
ping window," Nelsen said. "To
get there would help your career
after college if you get noticed."
For Davis, who graduates this
spring, the opportunity would be
invaluable as he looks to play pro
fessionally post-graduation.
Nelsen still has one more sea
son left at Stanford, and an
Olympic appearance would leave
the Cardinal squad without one
of its captains for part of next sea
son.
Both Nelsen and Davis would
be missed this fall as both have
had a significant impact on Stan
ford soccer.

As the quiet but strong captain
of this year's squad, Davis led
Stanford to a 12-5-2 record this
fall iu his last season with the Car
dinal. A defender with equally
strong offensive skills, the talent
of the versatile Davis will be
missed next season. He tallied 15
career points lor the (Cardinal and
will not be forgotten for his game
winner this season against Cali
fornia and assists on the overtime
game-winners against Santa
Clara this season and against San
Jose State last season in the first
round of the NCAA tournament.
"With Bobby, you get a pretty
good understanding of the
game," Davis said of his career
with the Cardinal. "Stanford has a
very strong professionally run
program — I think that's an ad
vantage. But when it comes to [in
ternational] games, the intensity
is so much more. It's hard to jump

into that environment."
Nelsen made an immediate
impact in his first season with the
Cardinal this fall. He garnered
All-Tournament honors at both
the Fresno Tournament and
Stanford / Nike Tournament.
The midfielder notched four as
sists and two game winning goals
against Bradley and Santa Clara,
respectively, during the season.
For his vital role in Cardinal suc
cess, Nelsen was named to the
first team Far West All-American
team at the end of the season.
"We look at it with mixed emo
tions," Clark said of New
Zealand's shot to qualify for the
Olympics. "If they qualify, we'd
be without Ryan for the first three
weeks of the season. But at the
same time, the opportunity for
both of them to get to the
Olympics is so exciting for them
and for Stanford."
On May 19, two of Stanford's finest men's
soccer players will swap their (Cardinal jerseys
for All Whites and abandon their quest fora
NCAA title in favor of an Olympic medal.
Senior Gerard Davis and junior Ryan
Nelsen, both New Zealand natives, return
home this week to rejoin the Under-23 Na
tional Team for the squad's final stretch of
Olympic qualifying matches. The New
Zealand All Whites will face South Africa in a
decisive two-game series — and thewinnei is
Sydney-bound.
The New Zealand squad breezed through
the first-round of qualifiers in December.
With wins over Vanuatu (4-0), Papua New
Guinea (5-0), Fiji (5-2) and the Solomon Is
lands (4-1), the team easily clinched the top
spot in the Oceania Olympic Qualifiers.
But South Africa, which finished fourth in
its qualifying series, will be a step up in coin
petition.
For Davis and Nelsen, gone are the days of
performing in front of the intimate fans at
New Maloney Field. When the squad steps
onto the high altitude field in Johannesburg,

they will be out in 112 ront of a sold-out crowd of
50,000.
"Our first game is at home, we'll have to
put in a really good performance to give us a
chance in South Africa [on May 29]," Davis
said. "It'll be a pretty tough environment to
go into."
While these two games will be the biggest
and most important that the two have seen,
neither is a stranger to international com
petition.
Both started off on the Under-20 Nation
al squad under Stanford head coach Bobby
Clark. From there, Nelsen went on to be
come one oft he youngest players on the New
Zealand Senior National l eain. He earned
valuable international experience this past
July playing against Brazil, Germany and the
United States at the Confederation Cup in
Mexico and was honored as the Royal Sun
and Alliance Young Player of the Year in
New Zealand soccer.
After stopping out last winter quarter to
participate in a training camp, Davis played
two matches with New Zealand against Aus
tralia last summer. He was then picked to

join the Under-23 Olympic team
along with Nelsen, the captain of
the squad.
"1 think they'll do well," Clark
said. "Ryan will be a leader the
way he is here and Gerard is so
technically clean and smooth —
both will be key players for the
New Zealand Olympic team."
The two have already made
their presence known as integral
to Kiwi success. Both started for
New Zealand in the Oceania qual
ifiers, and Nelsen notched a semi
final goal.
While lac k of international ex
perience may not be a factor in the
squad's upcoming matches, lack
of experience as a team might be.
With six overseas players, team

matches have been few, team
practices, non-existent.
