### TIM KANE STAFF WRITER 
You have to feel lor the Saint Mary's baseball team.
With a 19-31 overall record, and having lost five of
their last six, it doesn't seem fair for them to face red
hot Stanford, ranked second in the nation and win
ners of 1 Got its last 19.
Nobody ever said life was fair.
Wednesday at Sunken Diamond, the No. 2 Cardi
nal (37-12) w ill take on the (iaels in a non-conference
matchup with no bearing on the tight Pacific-10 con
ference race. But the game remains important
nonetheless.
Head coach Mark Marquess often uses mid-week
games to work his relatively young bullpen, giving
them valuable game experience while also prepping
them for use later in the year during the NCAA Tour
nament.
The Cardinal beat Oregon State twice over the
weekend up in Corvallis, closing the Beavers out Sim

day with a 7-5 win.
I his was another big win for this team," said Mar
quess. "We have now assured ourselves to play for at
least ;i share of the Pac-1() title* the following weekend
of the regular season versus UCLA."
Saint Mary's, which plays in the West Coast Con
ference, has already played Stanford twice this year,
with somewhat less than stellar results. Up in Moraga,
the Card dealt the Cads a 11-3 loss back on March 28,
while a week later at home Stanford came out with a
5-2 victory.
Starters for the game have not been announced
yet, but bet on someone from Stanford's bullpen
brigade â€” anyone from sophomores Mike Costing
Mike Wodnicki and Brad Drew to frosh Ryan (lloger
and Ryan Mi ( ally.
fhe next two weeks will be relatively tranquil for
Stanford, as the (Cardinal has no games this weekend
and no Pac-10 games until the three-game show
down with second-place UCLA May 19-21 for the
conference title.
