# Eating, drinking and playing ball
## Probing the relationship between sports and food 
### 
Rarely in my life have I felt
as guilty as 1 did a couple
weeks back, walking into
Pacific Bell Park carrying
a bag full of sandwiches from
Togo's. There is something very
fundamentally wrong about enter
ing a major league baseball stadium
with the clear and certain intention
toavoid eating a hot dog. Somehow,
yon feel as if the ghost of Joe Mc-
Carthy is going to show up at your
shoulder and ask you if t he hot dogs
weren't "red" enough for you.
In my defense, 1 wits driven to
these lengths by the absurdities of
Pac Bell concessions: half-hour
waits, $(i Polish sausages, sushi
plates in place of (aacker Jacks. Still,
1 felt like a Kenny G fan at the Bruce
Springsteen reunion tour.
The frankfurter, for me, is inex
tricably mixed up with the very ex
perience of watching a ballgame.
The two are intertwined in my
memory as early as my very first Red
Sox game at Fenway, in fourth
grade, when 1 vomited my very first
Fenway Frank straight into my step
father's beer in the bottom of the

sixth. Come to
think of it, I
haven't seen
him eat a hot
dog there since.
But rookie
wiener troubles
aside, it's an in
teresting syner
gy, the hot dog

and the stadium. But is it the Ix-st
sp< >rts fi m k1 < >1 all time? Questionable.
Certainly the hot dog is the most
obvious example of food/sport
unity, but there are others, I think,
that challenge ii for perfection of fit.
1 here are factors to consider here —
whether you're watching the game at
home or in the stands, whether it's
regular season or playoffs — but I
can think of a few challengers:
• Football and nachos. I 'm think
ing here specifically of Monday
Night Football, which is intended to
be watched in a sports bar or on
your gullible friend's big-screen TV.
Filher way, you're not at home, so
you don't have to worry about drip
ping grease or guacamole on your
own carpet. Besides, nothing wipes
away the guilt of cramming your
mouth full of chips, cheese and sour
cream like watching a 350-lb. line
man talk about his $8 million con
trad. F(X)tball is in many ways a fat

person's sport; why not emulate
your heroes and (ill the belly? Run
ner-up: cheese fries, bill only in
Chicago or other Midwestern cities.
• T-ball or Little League and
sliced oranges. 1 he two are pretty
much synonymous, to the point
when failed orange harvests have
been known to scuttle entire ' 1 -ball
leagues in parts of the country, Cod
forbid your mother show up to a
game on your assigned "orange
day" without a couple bags full;
someone's likely to "accidentally" let
a bat slip out of their hands and
whack you in the nose. Of course,
every pitcher knew that the spitball
paled in comparison to a good
dried-orange-juice-and-dirt ball.

ner-up: malt liquor in a paper bag,
but only if you're an older sibling or
passerby (see Ckxxl Will 1 hinting).
• Cricket and tea. The Brits have
done it right over there — they've
gone ahead and made the food a
part of the rules of the sport. When
your matches are actually required
to pause in the middle of the day for
tea, you know the tea growers and
crumpet bakers have too much
power in the commissioner's office.
