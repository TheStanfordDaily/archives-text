# Eating, drinking and playing ball
## Probing the relationship between sports and food 
### 
Rarely in my life have I felt
as guilty as 1 did a couple
weeks back, walking into
Pacific Bell Park carrying
a bag full of sandwiches from
Togo's. There is something very
fundamentally wrong about enter
ing a major league baseball stadium
with the clear and certain intention
toavoid eating a hot dog. Somehow,
yon feel as if the ghost of Joe Mc-
Carthy is going to show up at your
shoulder and ask you if t he hot dogs
weren't "red" enough for you.
In my defense, 1 wits driven to
these lengths by the absurdities of
Pac Bell concessions: half-hour
waits, $(i Polish sausages, sushi
plates in place of (aacker Jacks. Still,
1 felt like a Kenny G fan at the Bruce
Springsteen reunion tour.
The frankfurter, for me, is inex
tricably mixed up with the very ex
perience of watching a ballgame.
The two are intertwined in my
memory as early as my very first Red
Sox game at Fenway, in fourth
grade, when 1 vomited my very first
Fenway Frank straight into my step
father's beer in the bottom of the

sixth. Come to
think of it, I
haven't seen
him eat a hot
dog there since.
But rookie
wiener troubles
aside, it's an in
teresting syner
gy, the hot dog

and the stadium. But is it the Ix-st
sp< >rts fi m k1 < >1 all time? Questionable.
Certainly the hot dog is the most
obvious example of food/sport
unity, but there are others, I think,
that challenge ii for perfection of fit.
1 here are factors to consider here —
whether you're watching the game at
home or in the stands, whether it's
regular season or playoffs — but I
can think of a few challengers:
• Football and nachos. I 'm think
ing here specifically of Monday
Night Football, which is intended to
be watched in a sports bar or on
your gullible friend's big-screen TV.
Filher way, you're not at home, so
you don't have to worry about drip
ping grease or guacamole on your
own carpet. Besides, nothing wipes
away the guilt of cramming your
mouth full of chips, cheese and sour
cream like watching a 350-lb. line
man talk about his $8 million con
trad. F(X)tball is in many ways a fat

person's sport; why not emulate
your heroes and (ill the belly? Run
ner-up: cheese fries, bill only in
Chicago or other Midwestern cities.
• T-ball or Little League and
sliced oranges. 1 he two are pretty
much synonymous, to the point
when failed orange harvests have
been known to scuttle entire ' 1 -ball
leagues in parts of the country, Cod
forbid your mother show up to a
game on your assigned "orange
day" without a couple bags full;
someone's likely to "accidentally" let
a bat slip out of their hands and
whack you in the nose. Of course,
every pitcher knew that the spitball
paled in comparison to a good
dried-orange-juice-and-dirt ball.
Runner-up: Popsicles. Second run
ner-up: malt liquor in a paper bag,
but only if you're an older sibling or
passerby (see Ckxxl Will 1 hinting).
• Cricket and tea. The Brits have
done it right over there — they've
gone ahead and made the food a
part of the rules of the sport. When
your matches are actually required
to pause in the middle of the day for
tea, you know the tea growers and
crumpet bakers have too much
power in the commissioner's office.
Runner-up: Those little muffin


Jeff Cooper
things you put fruit or cream or
something on, what are those?
Scones? 1 don't know.
• Ice hotkey and fish / octopus /
squid. Not really so much to eat as to
throw. Flounder and other flat lish,
I've found, tend to lly the Ix'st, but
nothing pisses an opp< »ingl>enchoff
like squid under the skates. Runner
up: Pepto-Bisinol, for when some
goon shatters his nose on the glass
about eight inches from your face.
• The NBA and the 29-cent
hamburger. Because when you're
done paying for your seats, with
ticket prices what they are lately,
you iiin't got the cash for anything
else. Runner-up: For these playoffs,
No-Do/, to see if you can keep your
eyes open until the Lakers finally
hoist the trophy.
• Indiana men's basketball and
creatine. You're going to want to
bulk up when Bob Knight comes
after you in the stands. Runner-up:
Anabolic steroids, and lots ol 'em.

• Gladiatorial combat and
peeled grapes. | his is going pretty
old school, but when do yon ever
hear of anyone but Roman emper
ors having their grapes peeled?
Never, that's when. And what else
are they going to watch on a lazy
Sunday afternoon? Chariot races
are for wussies. (Note: Promotional
consideration here provided by
Dreamworks SRC.) Runner-up:
There's a vomitorium joke to Ije
made here, but I am going to take
the moral high road and avoid it.
Clearly, this is a tough question,
not likely to be settled in these
pages. I encourage you to experi
ment with your own combinations,
much like Jelly Belly entourages
you to try different flavors of jelly
beans together. (Minm, licorice and
peanut butter!) But in your experi
mentation, don't forget the old fa
vorites. 1 ended that night at Pac
Bell with a $6 Polish sausage in my
belly and happiness on my mind.
Some habits die hard.

aged to avoid making fun of NASCAR
far a whole column.
