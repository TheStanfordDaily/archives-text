# Sailors earn national berths in Santa Barbara

### BROOKE MORRILL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the Stanford sailing team headed down to
the fleet racing Pacific Coast Championships in
Santa Barbara this weekend, it wasn't anticipat
ing the closest match it had ever encountered.
Stanford pulled ahead in clutch final races to
become the No. 2 team in its region, earning
the Cardinal a position at fleet racing Nationals
in New York this June.
Eleven teams competed for the top two spots
in the two-division regatta in a series of 11 races.
The four schools which consistently finish in the
top four spots — USC, UC-Santa Barbara,
Stanford and Hawaii — were all present and
knew that it was their last chance to prove their
superiority.
Stanford arrived in Santa Barbara on Fri
day to find five to eight knots of breeze, and
the conditions continued throughout the
weekend.
" 1 he light winds were definitely an added
challenge," said co-captain Anika Leerssen.
"We can win under a broad range of breeze, but
we knew this venue would shift the focus to tac
tics rather than boat handling."
Graduate student Steve Khela represented
the Cardinal in theAdivision races while senior

Tyler Doyle took to the helm in B division.
"Going into the weekend, we knew our com
petition would be the same three teams we've
battled all season," Leerssen said. "But in an 11 -
team regatta, the A division will be tough be
cause of its depth — almost every school repre
sented has at least one top sailor competing."
Alter six races and a 5 p.m. finish Saturday,
Khela and Doyle were in third place, trailing
second-place UCSB by only one point and lead
ing Hawaii by ten.
"We accomplished our goal of being in the
race after the first two-thirds of competition.
There was a positive feeling on the team going
into Sunday's races," Leerssen said.
The first two sets of Sunday's competition
twisted Stanford's fate. Santa Barbara widened
the margin of its lead to seven points and
Hawaii made huge gains, bumping Stanford
down to the No. 4 position.
Going into the last set, USG had clinched the
No. 1 position with only 32 total points after the
first eight sets. Santa Barbara was in second
with s(> points, Hawaii, third with 58 points and
Stanford was in forth with 03 points.
Just as Khela predicted, the underdogs
made their killing, and just in the nick of time.
In redeeming his disappointing finishes
throughout the regatta, Khela took to the

course with senior crew Katie Gregg and placed
Ist and 2nd in their last two races.
Khela's efforts put Stanford within three
points of second place Santa Barbara for the
final races, placing Doyle in position to pull
ahead and capture the second place slot.
And pull ahead he did. Doyle and his crew,
junior Heather Porter, dominated the final two
races of the regatta with two first place finishes.
The stellar performance of both sailors tallied
their points to 68 for the weekend, three points
ahead of Santa Barbara and ten ahead of
Hawaii.
"We are all quite amazed at our perfor
mance — especially that of Mr. Doyle. 1 have
never seen him sail so fast — he was just on
fire," Khela said.
Tyler has been one of the team's best light
wind sailors, a reputation he earned through
out the races this weekend. He had four first
place finishes, one second and two thirds in the
ten completed races.
" This weekend was Stanford's best perfor
mance I've ever seen, and was the closest com
petition at PGGs possible."
The team will now compete at the national
level in both fleet racing and team racing at the
end of May and beginning of June at the ('oast
Guard and St. Mary's in Maryland.
