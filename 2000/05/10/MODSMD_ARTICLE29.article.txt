# Hillel moves out of Old Union into more spacious Row house

### KIRK SHIMANO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There's one Row house where even
single digit draw numbers won't get you
a room.
Located between 557 Mayfield and
(Campus Drive, the former Dunn-Bacon
house will soon become the home ol I fil
lel, the Jewish student organization.
I fillel is currently waiting for an agree
ment with University administrators on
what can be built on the property.
" The possibility of having a place on

campus would be transformative," Hillel
Rabbi Noa Kushner said.
The location was privately owned
until the spring of 1998 when long-term
resident Rosamund Bacon moved out,
and the University bought the property.
Members of the Newman Center
Catholic Community and the Stanford
Historical Society were also interested in
the house, but the lease was eventually
awarded to 1 fillel.
"We've tried to meet the needs of the
| Jewish J community, but we are really
constrained by space," said I lillel Kxecu

tive Director Debra Feldstein.
The organization's present office is lo
cated in the basement of the Old Union
clubhouse.
Feldstein plans to include a religious
and cultural library in the new center
and use the location for holiday celebra
tions and other social activities.
"It will really provide a locus lor Jew
ish cultural education and religious life
on campus," Feldstein said. "We will also
be welcoming members of other faiths in
an attempt to build bridges and foster re
lations."
