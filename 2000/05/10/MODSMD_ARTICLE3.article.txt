Haas Center Interim Director
Nadinne Cruz, a finalist lor the perma
nent director position, spoke yesterday to
a group of T>() students and faculty about
her vision for the future of the center.
The center needs to "build a commu
nity of public service educators with a
concern for issues in the world and a con
viction to act on them." Cruz said.
Cruz answered questions for over an
hour. The session is "an opportunity to
speak my mind, so I'm going to take it."
(Iruz said.
"There are main people interested in
public service here at Haas," Cruz said,
"and I believe the way to bring them to
gether is to have an extraordinarily big,
huge vision that all can act under. People
are going to need to work together to
make a dent in this institution. I lie I laas
Center has a unique nic he to till in con
tributing to academic life and making
Stanford an even greater institution."
(Iruz spoke adamantly about the need
to continually set higher goals lor the role

the public service center will play on cam
pus.
"If year after vear, the bar is the same
lor each incoming set of frosh, then we
have failed," Cruz said. "Kvery year, the
bar should be set higher and should be
connected to a deeper understanding ol
why public service is needed, gained

through the authority <>l direct expcii
ence with tlu- community: the .il>ilit\ to
say, I saw it with my own eyes, 1 worked
with those kids, I was at that hospital."
I his non-academic based knowledge is
still knowledge, even i! ii is not codified in
books.'
A proposal Cruz mentioned dining

tlit* session \v;is adding a set via- learning
component to one Introduction to Hu
manities course.
"Not having strategically placed ser
vice learning is a missed opportunity,"
(ii u/ said. "I have an idea foi an 1-111 M
i ourse, which would he titled, (-alifornia
Dream: Experiments with Utopian
Communities in California.' Students
could he pla< ed in organizations that deal
with certain Utopian ideals, of which
llieie ai e manv in (lalifornia."
( ) u/ also proposed the creation of a
I nivei sity-wide connnunitv service
lionot code, which she described as a
"hasic standard of principles regardless
ol the a< lis it\ between a community and
a scrvi( e participant."
In addition to articulating a vision loi
l he center's future, Cruz also spoke about
her proudest achievement as intci im di
re< tor lor the past year.
"I think we now have a more strongly
developed vision ol service education,"
Cruz said. "It is mote than at ademics, but
is academics. Ii is more than student de
velopment. but is student development.
I bis vision is something I'm very proud
01.
Cruz concluded the session with a
warning to those happy with the status
quo at the center.

Nadinne Cruz, a final candidate for director of the Haas Center, answered students'
questions about her vision for public service at Stanford at the center yesterday. Vice
Provost for Student Affairs James Montoya (right) attended the session.
"I clo want to warn you. don't
support me if you want to be com
fortable," Cruz said. "I don't oper
ate that way. Since the stakes are
high, the bar must be high. The bar
is high because the talent and dedi
cation of people at the Haas Center
is very high as well. I his bar is not
just to ac t on our convictions, but to

c reate a new knowledge base based
on a service track."
Students responded to Cruz's
ideas and suggestions positively.
"It was wonderful to lx- able to
spend this afternoon listening to
Nadinne's vision for the 1 bias Cen
ter," said Kelly Naylor, a graduate
student in civil and environmental
engineering. "She has played a c rit
ical role in my Stanford experience
and has incredible talents to share
with Stanford and the global com
munity."
