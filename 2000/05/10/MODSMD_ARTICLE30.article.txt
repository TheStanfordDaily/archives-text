# Sophomore College has reached size limit

### UDARA FERNANDO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sophomore College will offer fewer classes
this year than it did last year, but the number of
students per class will increase, keeping the
overall number of participants roughly the
same.
Sharon Palmer, director of Freshman/
Sophomore Programs, said the same number
of students who applied to Sophomore College
remained the same as last year — between 800
and 900, she estimated.
However, the number of classes has
dropped significantly this year. Twenty-seven
classes are being offered this fall, 11 fewer than
the 36 taught last spring.
Palmer attributes the drop in the number of
classes offered to an error in estimating the
number of faculty who would be available to
teach this summer.
"Projecting the numbers is an imprecise s( i
ence,"she explained, "rather like the Admission
Office trying to predict what their yield will be."
Sophomore College coordinators create
( lasses by asking faculty to participate in the
program. Coordinators consider a faculty
member's previous participation in the pro
gram, reputation as undergraduate teachers
in close settings and area of study before ex
tending invitations to teach a college seminar.
This year, however, several faculty mem
bers who originally expressed interest in par

ticipating in the college were forced to decline
at the last minute due to conflicting obligations.
"We wound up with a few fewer classes than
we had projected for 2000, just as last year the
college wound up with a few more classes than
projected. We did not seek either to expand or
substantially contract the college this year,"
Palmer said.
Although some students believe that the
quality of the Sophomore College experience
has declined because the number participating
students has increased, Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education John Bravman attrib
utes this perception not to a decline in the qual
ity of the program, but to the way students leel
about being part of the program.
"If you were one of 50 to HO students, you
naturally felt very special," Bravman said of stu
dents who took seminars in the early years of
Sophomore College. He said that, as the pro
gram expands and a greater number of people
are accepted, the feeling of being part (>fan elite
group fades.
Class size has increased slightly as Sopho
more College has expanded. In the first two
years of the college, the faculty-student ratio
was one to ten. This ratio has increased to
twelve students per professor this summer,
and is being fixed there, according to Brav
man.
Freshman Maia McAleavey, a Sophomore
College applicant, said it is important for
Sophomore College to adjust to growing de

mand without neutralizing the effectiveness of
the classes and what students gain from them.
"There are a lot of people who want to do
something academic in the two weeks befoie
their sophomore year, and it's a shame that
they are turned away," McAleavey said.
Bravman added that, although he could see
the program working with a few more students
in each seminar, a class si/e of twelve is an ideal
balance.

"Any smaller and disc ussions slow down; an\

Bravman stated that there were no plans to ex

class si/e or in the number of courses offered.
"We've reached a plateau of 112 unding and facul
ty availability," he said.
Palmer clarified that "Sophomore College
funding is secure and steady." and that the de
creased number of classes does not reflect
funding cutbacks.
