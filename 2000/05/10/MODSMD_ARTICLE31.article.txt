## 
### MARK BOUCHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Center for Education at the Stanford Medical
Center was forced to cancel some summer courses
and workshops because the U.S. Postal Service did
not deliver its course catalogs on time.
The delay occurred at a San Francisco processing
center, not the Stanford post office. Postal officials ad
mitted that 17,000 catalogs sat unprocessed in a San
Francisco depot fora month.
The Center for Education did not send out the cata
logues, but worked through a direct mailing company,
Post Haste. Harry Stangel, the manager of Post Haste,
said the company received 25,000 summer course c at
alogs from the Center for Education in March.
Fhe company dropped off 17,000 of the catalogs at
a San Francisco bulk mail processing center on March
27. They also dropped offB,ooo catalogs at a San Jose
processing center on that date. Stangel said he is un
sure if those catalogs were delivered promptly.
Sherry Ross, the administrative manager for the
Center for Education, received her copy of the cata
log at her Mountain View home five weeks after it was
supposed to be delivered. Bulk mail normally takes
about five clays to be delivered.
Ross called Stangel to inquire about the delay.
Stangel then called the postal service to investigate the
problem. According to Stangel, the operations man
ager at the processing center admitted that he had be
come aware of some problems at the facility.
" Fhe operations manager said that some of the

[other] managers had tailed to implement propel
first-in-first-out procedures," Stangel said. "In Kng
lish, [that means tlieyl blew it."
"We apologize for any inconvenience to our cus
tomers," said post office spokesman I lorace I linshaw
in the Palo Alto Daily News. "(ilearh there was a
breakdown in the system."
Stangel has requested a refund ofthe $2,700 spent
011 postage, but postal officials told him that the post
office does not nonnalh give refunds, except for let
ters sent with guaranteed deliver)', such as express
mail or registered mail. Stangel said thai the post of
fice is still reviewing his claim.
I fe also said that the ( enter for Kducation should
be entitled to a refund of at least ;i portion of the
$18,000 they spent produc ing the catalogs, since the
catalogs are now partially worthless. According to
Ross, the mistake has forced the centei to cancel
some of the planned c lasses and workshops, but it
still must pay the speakers who planned to teach
these courses.
The Center also lost revenue from the tuition that
students would have paid to enroll in the canceled
classes. Ross said that the total cost of the mistake lias
not yet been tallied.
"This is bad PR," Ross said m the Palo Alto I);iil\
News. "We don't want to get a reputation lor having
to cancel classes."
Stangel said that he has never seen such a large vol
ume of mail lost 01 delaved. lie believes thai this
episode represents the "shabb\ conduct of a public
agency."
