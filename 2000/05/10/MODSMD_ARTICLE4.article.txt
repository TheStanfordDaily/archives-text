### KIRK SHIMANO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
All hough Stanford lias long been a breeding
ground for Internet startup ideas, yesterday marked
the first time the University launched a startup of its
own.
Based on a medical service previously used by
Stanford clinicians, e-Skolar allows physicians to exe
cute fast, cross-referenced searches of textbooks,
medical journals, drug databases and c linical guide
lines.
"The explosion of medical knowledge has created
a situation where it's impossible for one person to stay
abreast through standard journal reading," said Ross
Bright, associate clean for alumni affairs at the School
of Medicine. E-Skolar "will be an incredible adjunct
to medical learning."
Although the company will function as an inde
pendent startup, the Medical School will oversee the
enterprise and Stanford representatives plan to sit on
the board of directors. The University also controls a
majority stake in the company.
The Medical School will share tec hnology and col
laborate on content production with e-Skolar.
"This isn 't just a startup that happens to be associ
ated with Stanford," e-Skolar CEO Paul Lippe ex
plained. "This is a spin-off from Stanford that takes a
little of what Stanford does and delivers it to the
Web."
The software used to run e-Skolar was developed
on-c ampus, funded with grants written by Ken Mel
inon, former associate clean for medical education
and the chief medical officer for e-Skolar.
Melmon's interest in using the Internet as a med
ical tool began with concerns that continuing educa
tion programs were inadequately preparing physi
cians, especially family doctors, for increasingly severe
diseases. After completing a survey of doctors, Mel
tnon concluded that physicians needed a system that
could provide answers to medical questions within
seconds, according The San Jose Mercury News.
"Universities have not stepped up to the challenge
of sustaining professionals. The Web provides the
option to define new user-driven learning," Lippe
said.
Melmon raised funds to hire graduate students in
both medicine and computer science to develop a
searchable online medical information database. A
beta, or test, version of the Web site was established in
1998.
"The students were the first people to find it,"
Melmon told The San Jose Mercury News.
Soon, Stanford faculty and physic ians also began
using the network.
"We found that Stanford clinicians are actually
using the system in the presence of their patients, in
dicating a very high degree of confidence in the in
formation and how it is presented," Melmon said in
a press release.
After perusing a standard amount of content,
phvsic ians have the option of answering a short quiz
on what they have read. Doctors who successfully
pass these tests can earn continuing medical educa
tion c redits, necessary to maintain a license to prac
tice medicine.
Unlike its test version, e-Skolar is available to any
physician or medical group that pays the annual user
fee of $240.
