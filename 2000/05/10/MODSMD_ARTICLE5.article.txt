### PATRICK C. CROSETTO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Monday evening, a small fire broke
out on wooden scaffolding on the roof of
Toyon H ill. Police believe it was set inten
tionally.
No damages or injuries due to the fire
were reported to police.
Imogen Church, manager of under
graduate housing operations, said she
knew little of the fire, but was told by Roll

and Linda Paste, Toyon's resident fellows,
that the hall did not sustain any structural
damage.
Church also said she was assured that
the $13 million Capital Improvement Pro
ject renovation currently underway at
Toyon had nothing to do with the fire.
However, the fire on the wooden scaffold
ing was more dangerous than it normally
would have been because Toyon's roof
tiles were removed, exposing the roofs
wooden structure.

Shortly after ( .) p.m., senior Kim Myers
noticed sparks coming from the roof of
Toyon on the side dose to Prannei I iall
and Schwab Residential ('.entei.
Myers, a resident assistant in I'oyon,
went into the lounge to inform resident
Sean Collins of the lire. While Collins in
vestigated the situation. Myers immediate
ly phoned the fire depai inient.
"You could see (lie light from the
ground," (iollins said. "It w;is not ver\ big.
mavbe ;i foot in diameter."

Resident Pete 1 i inkle, a sophomore,
< limbed onto the roof and the scaffolding,
poured water on the lire and put it out.
Sergeant Hilary Karp, a spokesperson
lor the Stanford Polite Department, said
an investigation is currently ongoing and
the officers have not yet completed their
report.
"Its looks like it was an intentionally set
fire, but we don't have am suspects at the
moment," said Karp.
Karp said that lie hopes the prelimi

nary report will Ik 1 filed l>\ Wednesday
morning or by Thursday at the latest.
Collins said he heard firemen say a big
rope had been located near the scene of
the lire, and it appeared as though some
one had lit the rope, causing the fire.
Collins said he and Myers believed it
was some sort of electrical fire, perhaps
caused by faulty wiring as a result of the
I'oyon CIP renovation.
"(The lire] was orange-red col
ored, and it seemed electrical be
cause it looked like there was a big
wire that had caught on lire,"
(lollins said.

(lollins, however, doubted it
was arson. "Hit was arson it seems
to me that they would have done a
better job," he said.
Most loyon residents were un
aware of the fire. Sophomore
Katie Hansen said, "I hadn't
heard anything about it .... It
sounds ridiculous. I'm glad Pete
put it out."
