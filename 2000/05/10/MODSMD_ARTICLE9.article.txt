Sun loses suit to Microsoft
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Microsoft has won a signif
icant victory in its ongoing legal battle with Sun Mi
crosystems over the Java programming language, as a
federal judge dismissed Sun's claim that Microsoft had
broken copyright laws.
Sun had sued Microsoft for designing a Windows-only
version of Sun's Java technology, which was incompatible
with other software. Sun said it represented both copy
right infringement as well as a breach of their licensing
contract, but U.S. District Judge Ronald Whyte said Mon
day the dispute was solely a contractual one. Sun's
breach-of-conti act claims against Microsoft are still pend
ing.
Java, promoted by Sun as a universal programming
language, allows developers to write a software applica
tion once and have it run on a variety of computers, re
gardless of the underlying system.
Mark Murray, a spokesman for Microsoft, said his
company was "obviously pleased" with Judge Whyte's
tilling.
Napster defeated by RIAA
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Embattled Napster, Inc.,
which had sought to define its MP3 software system as an
Internet service provider to limit its liability in a copyright
infringement lawsuit, lost the battle to limit monetary
damages in court.
U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ruled Friday
that Napster was not entitled to "safe harbor" under a sec
tion of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act because the
company "does not transmit, route or provide connec
tions for allegedly infringing material through its system."
The Recording Industry Association of America,
which sued Napster in December for copyright infringe
ment and related state law violations. The trade organi
zation applauded Patel's ruling on the "safe harbor" issue.
"This hearing was Napster's attempt to escape respon
sibility for aiding and abetting wide scale piracy and, not
surprisingly, they lost," RIAA president I lilary Rosen said
Monday.
The "safe harbor" provision of the act was crafted to
protect Internet service providers such America Online
and Farthlink from the illegal actions of their users.
The RIAA has accused Napster of encouraging users
of the company's software and computer servers to trade
copyrighted music online without permission.
