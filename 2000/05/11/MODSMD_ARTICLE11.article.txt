1985
A Daily feature detailed the increasing
popularity of aerobic dancing as a form of
physical training and exercise among Stan
ford students and staff. Accompanied by
pictures of dance classes reminiscent of
"Fame" and "Flashdance," the reporter
wrote:
"Aerobic dancing is a growing activity at
Stanford. Last year, 804 individuals at
tended Cowell's Health Promotion Pro
gram classes. According to data cards filled
out by new participants, reasons cited for
joining the program included, in order of
frequency, 'to get in shape,' 'to lose
weight,' 'to relieve stress,' 'to have fun,
and 'to meet people.'
"An interesting trend in recent years
has been a slow but steady increase in the
number of male participants. [Stanford
Aerobics instructor Amy] Slater notes that
traditionally aerobic dancing was attuned
only to women's problem areas — primari
ly hips, thighs and buttocks — but recently
instructors are becoming more aware of
men's interests, including arm, c hest and
shoulder exercises.
"Mistaken perspectives on the part of
both sexes also contributed to the lack of
male participants. One man who has never
tried aerobic dancing felt it to be 'a bunch
of women and wimps 112 ooling around,'
while several non-participant women felt
men go 'just to gape at girls in sexy outfits,'
as one woman said."
The Bottom Line: Did those people really look
any sillier than those who fill dorm lounges
doing Tae-Bo these days?
