Ever since Geoff Abrams decided
to get serious about tennis, he became
a youth phenom at age 13 and
dreamed about playing at Stanford
and one day turning pro.
That day is about to come.
No matter how Abrams and his
Cardinal teammates finish at the
NCAA men's tennis championships
later this month in Athens, Ga., this
year's Stanford team captain and top
player will join the big, bad world of
the pro futures and satellites circuits,
where many are 'playingfor meal
money.'

The San Francisco Chronicle
