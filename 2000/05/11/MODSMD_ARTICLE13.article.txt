I he rebels' scattered resistance has exploded into

I N. pea<(keepers, Sierra Leone's arm\ and pro

Fhousands ol refugees poured into the capital, lleeing

While lew will speculate on the reasons behind the
-Revolutionary I nited Front's attacks, events leading
up lo them indicate that rebels were beginning to feel
squeezed bv L .N. forces, who unlike the Nigerians,
were moving into rebel-controlled territory.

"Il is certainly a plausible hypothesis that their
actions were reactive to our progressive deployment,"
said Shashi 1 haroor, a lop aide to I >.N. Secretary-( Gen

1 lie United Nations hasn't done a lull analysis on
how the crisis began and l haroor couldn't say what
had gone wrong. Lhere was, however, speculation that
ihe rebels had little intention of honoring the peace
accord.
"Il is equally possible that this was a premeditated
action aiming at either undoing the peace agreement
oral capturing power or quite siniph at thwarting the
peacekeepers before thev could be lully deployed,"
I liaroot said.
In the davs and weeks leading up to the start of the
< risis \lav I, there were increasing attempts In the
I nited Nations to implement the July peace agree
ment and stepped up resistance from rebels.
I wo davs before the first hostages were taken, the
<oinniander <>l the U.N. peacekeeping mission, Maj.
(.en. Vija\ Kumar |etlev, told reporters in Freetown
that a Xambian contingent would deploy to the rebel
held town of koidu, seat ol the rebels' diamond-min
ing center in the eastern k< >110 district.
011 several occasions belore the announcement,
rebels prevented l .N. troops from conducting recon
naissance missions to Koidu, where hundreds ol open
pit diamond mines can be seen from the air, U.N. offi
cials said. ()nly unarmed U.N. observers — not armed
peacekeepers — were allowed by rebels to spend the
night in the town, and then only one night at a time.
