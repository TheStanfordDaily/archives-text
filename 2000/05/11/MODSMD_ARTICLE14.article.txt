## 
### 
SKA'fTIT (AIM — Microsoft dorp,
asked ;i federal judge vesierda\ to dismiss
the Justice Department's "adventurous
proposal to break ii into two parts, saying
stub a punishment would be too severe.
In iis legal response to the government's
proposed remedv, Mic rosofi said there was
110 basis lor a breakup and that the issues
involved do not warrant "such a radical
step."
"The retorcl of this case simply does not
support the government's efforts to dis
member Microsoft and reshape the soft
ware industn in a speculative effort to
weaken Microsoft's market position." the
coinpanv's attornevs told I .S. District
| udgc Thomas I'enlield |acksou.
Microsoft also maintained that no com
pany that attained its inonopoh powei
through growth — ralliei than acquiring
its rivals — has evci been broken u|>.
I ,;ist month, I he Justice 1 )epai Uncut and

17 states submitted a plan to break
Microsoft into two companies — one that
would sell its dominant Windows coniput
ei operating s\ stem, the other selling \ irtu
<ill\ even thing else Microsoft produces,
including the p(>pulai Microsoft ()flice soft
ware suite and the Microsoft Network
Internet services.
I lie plan was submitted to Jackson, who
on April 3 found Microsoft to be a
monopoly with business practices that vio
lated state and federal antitrust laws.
"Ihe government's adventurous
re<|iiest to split Microsoft into two compa
nies should be rejec ted as a matter of law,"
the soli ware giant said in its legal filing.
I here was no immediate comment ves
tcrda\ from the Justice Department on
Microsoft's filing.
Mu rosoft said if Jackson was not willing
to dismiss the government's proposal out
right, the conipam would be willing to take

actions addressing some of the business
practices that the government found to be
objectionable.
It said it was willing to hide the comput
er screen desktop icon in its Windows
operating system that leads users to its Web
browser, and would allow computer mak
ers to prominently feature any software,
including that of Microsoft's competitors,
on the Windows desktop.
However, Microsoft stopped short of
offering to remove Internet Kxplorer
entirely from Windows, saying it wanted to
retain the right to use it in various other
functions.
Microsoft also said it would be willing to
oiler equal contracts to computer makers,
regardless of whether they agreed to sup
port competitors' software. Ii would also
provide equal access to technology that
would allow any software maker, including
the company's competitors, to easily write

programs for Windows.
The company suggested a number of
different timetables for moving toward
with the case, depending on how Jackson
wants to deal with remedies.
The lengthiest scenario has proceedings
lasting until December. However, if Jack
son finds in Microsoft's favor on nearly
every point, the case could wrap up in
August.
Microsoft also suggested different legal
strategies Jackson might use to expedite
the case in the I'.S. Court of Appeals, the
next destination of the antitrust case. In
meetings with attorneys last month, Jack
son said he would be willing to move the
case to the appeals courts quickly.
Microsoft spokesman Jim dullinan said
that the August timeframe would only
occur if Jackson decided not to pursue a
breakup and was not interested in opening
up Microsoft's intellectual property —

most notably the source code to the Win
dows operating system — to the public at
large.
Otherwise, lie said, Microsoft will need
more time to assess the impact of the gov
ernment's proposals on the compam and
the overall high-tech industry.
"Because the government is so out of
bounds, we need to do a lot of research and
investigation to figure out what these kinds
of remedies will do to the industry and the
economy," Cullinan said. "We believe that
the ramifications of what they want to do
would be devastating, and want the chance
to show the judge exactly that."
The government has until May 17 to
counter Microsoft's response, and Jackson
has scheduled a May 24 hearing to consid
er the issue. Microsoft has made it clear,
however, that it needs more time to gath
er depositions and evidence to combat
the government's proposal.
