# Two people will split $363 million lottery
## 
### 
UTICA, Mich. (AF) — Out of
the millions who wanted to win
mega-millions, the Big Game lot
tery came down to two tickets —
one sold in Michigan, the other in
Illinois — whose holders will split
a record $363 million bounty.
Michigan lottery officials were
contacted yesterday by a "remark
ably quite calm" man they believe
holds one of the winning tickets.
But as of midday, Illinois officials
had yet to hear from the tick
et holder there.
The winning tickets to l ues
day night's drawing in the seven
state lottery were sold at Mr. k's
Party Shoppe near Utica, 20 miles
north of Detroit, and Sweeney's
Gitgo in the Ghicago suburb of
Lake Zurich.
John Sweeney, owner of
Sweeney's Gitgo, hit the jackpot,
too — a $1.8 million bonus for
selling a winning ticket. Bui
because of Michigan's different
rules, Mr. K's owner George
Kassab will get only $2,000.
"It's a slap on the face," son
Mark Kassab said.
The jackpot easily topped the
previous American record, a
$295.7 million Powerball pri/e
split by 13 machinists in VVester
ville, Ohio, two years ago.
Big Game tickets are sold in
Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Mas
sachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey
and Virginia.
In Michigan, the man who
claimed to have the winning
numbers didn't identify himself,
but the validation numbers he

recited from his ticket matched,
lottery spokeswoman Sarah I.ap
shan said. He did not sa\ where
he was from or whether the ticket
was his alone or bought for a
group.
"I'm pretty confident this is the
winning ticket, Lapshan said.
The drawing capped days of
frenzy that sent lottery veterans
and first-time players alike st in ry
ing for $1 chances .it the big
dream, despite odds of 7(> million
to 1 against getting all six num
bers. Some waited for several
hours in lines at stores near non-
Big Game states.
"At least I only lost a dollar,"
said Robert I lolland. a bartender
at the East Atlanta Restaurant and
Lounge.
Shirley All/, a regulai cus
tomer of the Michigan store that
sold the winning ticket, said she
Hipped on I V Wednesday morn
ing, saw the news and grabbed
her $20 worth of tickets — but
found no fortune.
Given her severe asthma, she
said, it's probably just as well.
"I could go into shock." Alt/
said. "I hope whoever won it
needed it and had a rough life."
How much the winners will
take home depends on state taxes
in Michigan and Illinois.
Don Gilmer, Michigan lottery
commissioner, estimated that the
Michigan winner could gel $7
million a year — 5135,000 a week
— over the next 20 years, before
taxes. I le said lie couldn't give an
after-tax figure.
