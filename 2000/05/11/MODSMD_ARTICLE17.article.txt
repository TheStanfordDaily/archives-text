## The 						Stanford Daily New dining services plan may be missing the mark 
### 
STANFORD HOUSING AND Dining
Services recently announced their
intent to look into possibilities for a
new meal plan that would assign meals
by the quarter rather than by the week.
Under all current board plans, any unused
meals simply disappear from the student's
account at the end of the week and are no
longer usable.
With this new quarter block plan, meals
can be used at any time during the quarter
and the slate would be wiped clean only three
times a year. In addition, there has been talk
of including a "nieals-to-points" feature that
would allow students to cash in their meals
for the equivalent number of points. T his
new plan would accommodate students with
erratic meal schedules and give more flexibil

ity to the meal plans.
But is this new plan unnecessarily com
plex? Is there a reason to create an entirely
new meal plan that essentially emulates the
point system used in Manzanita? II students
are allowed to convert meals to points any
time ihey want, there doesn't seem to be any
thing stopping students from simply convert
ing a quarter's worth of meals into points and
ending up with the exact same plan that is
used in Manzanita. And giving people all
points in the beginning reduces the hassle of
converting meals and allows students to eat at
any location on campus without worrying
about their current points-to-meals ratio.
When one considers the fact that next
year's freshmen will not be allowed to have
cars on campus (and, therefore, can't escape

dorm dining whenever the food gets too
bad), il seems especially important to imple
ment a plan that really gives campus dining
halls an incentive to increase the quality of
their services.
Perhaps a new money-back plan should be
created. For example, the meal plan could be
structured similar to the Stanford Card Flan.
So, instead of having a balance of meals
remaining, it would simply be a balance of
cash. At the end of the quarter, any unused
money could either be refunded or put
toward the next quarter's board bill. This plan
would also encourage dining halls to improve
their service because poor quality food would
mean less money.
The way meal plans currently work, since
payments are made at the beginning of each

quarter, even if the service is terrible and stu
dents rarely use the dining hall, the dining
hall still gets paid. The University rationalizes
this by saying that students always have the
option of eating at other dining halls on c am
pus (thus giv ing the better dining halls more
money), but this is often not a feasible option,
especially during breakfast and lunch when
students are rushing to get to their next class.
Plus, the money from unused meals must go
somewhere at the end of the quarter.
The new quarterly block meal plan is defi
nitely a step in the right direction, but there
are still improvements that could be made.
Dining halls are almost always a more conve
nient option for students, so finding a way to
improve their quality would benefit almost
evervone.
