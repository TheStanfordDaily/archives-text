# MODERN LIFE IS RUBBISH
## Victims of e-Business 
### 
II tin lire liisioi i.uis ever compile a list
<>l "Victims <>l e-Business," ('.harles
jolin Swansou will likely register as
a footnote. I lie 71-year-old retired
pharmacist stormed into a Wells Fargo
branch in Woodside some weeks past
weal ing a ski mask and waving a loaded
handgun.

Despite Ins shaking
hands, he managed to
lake ovei $10,000 in
t asli and load n into his
getaway car, a dilapi
dated Plymouth Sun
dance. lie made ii as
l.n as Sand I lill Road
before he was pulled
< >\ it and arrested.
I lie reason, ii tran-

spires, was ih.n he couldn t .illord to pay
his rent .it ()ak Creek Apartments, the
chichi tree-lined complex a spilling dis
tance from the Stanford goll course.
Kvcr since the technology boom
turned Silicon Vallev into the hottest
piece o! real estate since the Holy Land,
rent loi an apartment in the complex has
been subjec I to jumps of several hundred
dollars, saddling residents with monthly
bills as high as $l\, 100.
I his makes sense In the strange logic
of prestige; corporations have taken to
setting up "virtual ollices" in Palo Alto so
dial their mail <au be delivered to a dis
tinguished 9-1 MX zip code. »nr average
middle-iucoine retiree, however, is out of
luck.
I he apparent alternative is a crime
spree, oi perhaps a dramatic escape from
suburbia into the country a la the close of
lerry (William's "llraz.il." 1 hough, given
California geography, one would most
likely end up someplace like Cilroy (town
motto: "It's worth the drive").
()f course, the much-touted "Informa
tion Age" hasn't brought Cilliam's night
mare future with it — just the reverse.
I be Internet is anti-totalitarian by
nature: its difficult to control a medium
where any schmuck with a copy of
Netscape Composer can put up a page
dedicated to his or her very own beer bot
tle collection.
Now that the millennium has come
and gone, exciting those who get excited
by numbers with lots of zeros, the great
est apparent fallout from the brave new e
world is that we can shamelessly put low
ercase "e's" in front of any noun in the
language.
I he new century looks more like
something out of Kurt Vonnegut: all the
weirdness of our culture amplified and
shot out for mass dissemination.
The Web as we know it consists of: a)

harmless il insipid corporate sites, h)
porn, c) strange amusing items like the
dancing hahy, and d) strange disturbing
items from fringe groups like www.god
hatesfags.com. I his last is so extreme in
its rhetoric that the average surfer is par
doned for assuming the whole thing to be
a poorly conceived joke (it's not).
And Vonnegut could have written a
novel in his sleep about an elderly phar
macist who turns to armed robbery, try
ing to keep up with this new breed of
twentysomethings who pay for lattes with
$100 bills and orchestrate the world's
information flow between s;ikc bombs at
Miyake.
"It is sad," says one of the Wells largo
hostages. "But by the same token, it's
hard to feel too sorry when someone
comes in with a gun and threatens to kill
you." Meanwhile, Swansou is incarcerat
ed in Redwood City with bail set at
$250,000.
So it goes, as Vonnegut would say.
I his might inspire the civic-minded
among us to get indignant about wealth
distribution and sign up for programs at
the Haas ( '.enter in that vein. The rest of
us are reduced to mouthing platitudes
about e-inevitability, or just hitting career
fairs to score free mouse pads from
Kxcite.com.
In a way, it's odd to think of the e
econotny as having a counterpart in the
physical world. Its putative point, as
demonstrated in those appealingly multi
cultural IBM commercials, is that dis
tance and place no longer matter. Appar
ently. that's true until it's time to collect
the rent.
I he University Avenue exit on the 101
evinces the sheer weirdness of this. A
concrete ditch ten feet wide separates
Palo Alto from EPA: on one side, a taste
fully landscaped multimillion-dollar
home, on the other, a building a cut
above a tenement.
* I 'his invites hyperbolic comparisons to
the Berlin Wall, or at least Marie
Antoinette. It's secretly titillating to envi
sion a Fight Club-esque militia descend
ing on the Coral Zone and laying waste to
the surrounding buildings, while on the
fourth floor e-entrepreneurs spill their
lattes and bellow "Let them eat cake!"
into their cell phones. The revolution will
not be televised, but you'll see it reflected
in the tech stocks.
Failing that, there's always Cilroy. The
annual Garlic Festival is this July, and you
can read all about it at www.gilroygar
licfestival.com. Bon appetit.
