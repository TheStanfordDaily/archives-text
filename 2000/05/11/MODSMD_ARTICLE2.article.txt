### BEN ALEXANDER-BLOCH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Mariann Byerwalter, Stanford's vice
president lor business allairs and t liief fi
nancial officer, will step down June SO, hut
will advise new President John llenness\
part-time next year.
"1 am leaving to return to the private
sector," Byerwalter said. "I want to evalu
ate a range of options once 1 reduce my
full-time commitment."
Several University administrators

voiced their appreciation for what Byer
walter has done over the past four years.
"Mariann has been the best CFO and
vice president for business affairs that we
could possibly have had," University Pres
ident Cerhard Casper said in a press re
lease. "Her business experience, her abili
ty to manage a large, complicated organi
zation and her skill in the oversight of
complex business arrangements and con
trad negotiations brought us an acumen
that is rare.
"1 deeply appreciate her courage as a

leader and the many contributions she has
made to Stanford," he said.
Prior to her job at Stanford, Byerwalter
co-founded a company that purchased
failed banks from the government, then
reworked them until they made profits.
She became the chief operating officer and
chief financial officer of Americ a First Fu
reka Holdings and chief financial officer of
Furekaßank after the bank was purchased
by her company.
When asked if she would return to
banking, Byerwalter replied, "I am cur

rently on the boards of several companies
in the financial services '.rea, so I will still
be involved in that sector."
The boards on which she currently
serves are quite diverse, including Inter
net companies, non-profit organizations
and the Stanford I lospital.
"Mariann brought exceptional poise
and grace to a very challenging job," said
former University Provost Condoleezza
Rice. "She possessed strong business acu
men and she was extremelv capable. She
has a deep love for Stanford, she is a huge

sports fan . . . and we had a marvelous re
lationship in the four years I've worked
with her."
Byerwalter will chair the search com
mittee looking for her replacement, but
presently the committee has no one specif
ically in mind to fill her shoes.
"Mariann has a very unique blend of
skills and qualities that are difficult to re
place in one person," said Peggy Hiraoka,
director of human resources and a mem-
berof the committee to find a new
CFO. "Her people skills combined
with her business skills make her a
very special asset. Her under
standing of Stanford and her affin
ity with Stanford made her espe
cially helpful in her position."
Vice President of the Medical
Center Eugene Bauer, who
worked with Byerwalter regularly,

hoped that the committee would
be able to "find someone that has
all of the exemplary qualities that
she has shown.
"She brought an enormous
breadth of understanding to the
position and an attention to the
human side of the business that
many had forgotten," Bauer said.
Byerwalter graduated from
Stanford in 1982 and received her
MBA from Harvard in 1984.
While she was at Stanford she was
a resident assistant in Brainier, de
bate team coach and an ASSU

president.
Since her 1984 graduation
from Harvard Business School,
she has had consistent involve
ment with the University, first #s a
volunteer with the Alumni Associ
ation Board, including a term as
chair of the Board, then servingon
the Board of Trustees, while in
volved in her business career.
She then made a full-time com

currently holds.
