Labor Action Coalition not SLAC
(Stanford Linear Accelerator Center)
Since 1962, the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center has been called
"SIAC." Imagine our surprise to see
your headline with our ac ronym in con
nection with May Day activities ("SIAC
recognizes May Day," May 2). It is unfor
tunate that your writer and editor did
not recognize the ambiguity created by
shortening the name of the Labor Ac tion
Coalition. SLAC is a national user facili
ty that employs 1,200 people and hosts
another 2,000 visiting researchers who
conduct experiments in physics. Ihe
Daily is welcome to tour our lab by con
tacting us.

Student cars not all the/re crocked up to be
Ever wonder what the silent person
squished in the middle of the backseat is
thinking?
It's been almost fbni years and
miraculously — some might say — I
have gotten through life at Stanford
without a car and without a sad thought
about it. Okay, so maybe the last asser
tion is a step away from the truth, but as
friends have
purchased / won / found / stumbled

upon cars of their very own over the
years my status in "cardom" has
remained static. No car. No way. No
time soon.
Being little Miss Independent, I hate
to bum rides off of friends. So I've
developed a steady love / hate relation
ship with public transportation. One
hour to Foothill. One and a half back
including Marguerite time. lake the
Marguerite to Palo Alto Station, bus for
25 minutes to WalMart. Maybe the plas
tic file folder container and the five dol
lar bottle of shampoo weren't worth it,
but Ross is right nearby, and I am an
unpaid advocate of that place!
But busing it alone just isn't the great
time I'd likt* to make it out to be. Smelly
buses, late Marguerites, uncaring Cal-
Trains whooshing past as I run up the
tunnel to get to the northbound side —
too late.
But given all of this, I am still an
advocate of the "No Cars for Little
Freshmen" rule. Think of all of the
bonding time they will have! I am easily
amused so as I take the following trip
down memory lane. Bear with me.
I remember fun trips with my draw
mates to Hillsdale via Call rain, to the
city for an evening out or a Marguerite
trip to the Stanford Mall to satisfy a
McDonald's craving. But now, all of my
drawmates have cars. I rarely see them.
Each is off on her own highly important
Rite Aid run for cotton swabs. Or dash

ing to Safeway for tortilla chips and
salsa.
There is a divide between the "haves"
and the one "has-not" that just can't be
bridged. Trips downtown were once a
treat. Now they are no big deal. Hop in
the car. Done. The bonding is now over
whose turn it is to drive and the great
gas mileage with such and such a car. I

sit quietly in the back seat and wish 1
had my own car. Oops. 1 wish I was on
the Marguerite.

"Morality" overused in
discussions on Cuba
I was delighted to read Isaac kos-
Read's and Nathaniel Joseph Klemp's
letter ("Looking at Cuba in perspective
and from the inside," May 8) about their
experiences in Cuba. It was a noble
thrust against petrified ideologies that
have long dictated American attitude
toward Cuba. Also, it proved a valuable
reminder that nothing can substitute for
direct experience.
I was particularly happy that the let
ter moved between a short term paper
and an informed piece of journalism.
