Labor Action Coalition not SLAC
(Stanford Linear Accelerator Center)
Since 1962, the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center has been called
"SIAC." Imagine our surprise to see
your headline with our ac ronym in con
nection with May Day activities ("SIAC
recognizes May Day," May 2). It is unfor
tunate that your writer and editor did
not recognize the ambiguity created by
shortening the name of the Labor Ac tion
Coalition. SLAC is a national user facili
ty that employs 1,200 people and hosts
another 2,000 visiting researchers who
conduct experiments in physics. Ihe
Daily is welcome to tour our lab by con
tacting us.

Student cars not all the/re crocked up to be
Ever wonder what the silent person
squished in the middle of the backseat is
thinking?
It's been almost fbni years and
miraculously — some might say — I
have gotten through life at Stanford
without a car and without a sad thought
about it. Okay, so maybe the last asser
tion is a step away from the truth, but as
friends have
purchased / won / found / stumbled

upon cars of their very own over the
years my status in "cardom" has
remained static. No car. No way. No
time soon.
Being little Miss Independent, I hate
to bum rides off of friends. So I've
developed a steady love / hate relation
ship with public transportation. One
hour to Foothill. One and a half back
including Marguerite time. lake the
Marguerite to Palo Alto Station, bus for
25 minutes to WalMart. Maybe the plas
tic file folder container and the five dol
lar bottle of shampoo weren't worth it,
but Ross is right nearby, and I am an
unpaid advocate of that place!
But busing it alone just isn't the great
time I'd likt* to make it out to be. Smelly
buses, late Marguerites, uncaring Cal-
Trains whooshing past as I run up the
tunnel to get to the northbound side —
too late.
But given all of this, I am still an
advocate of the "No Cars for Little
Freshmen" rule. Think of all of the
bonding time they will have! I am easily
amused so as I take the following trip
down memory lane. Bear with me.
I remember fun trips with my draw
mates to Hillsdale via Call rain, to the
city for an evening out or a Marguerite
trip to the Stanford Mall to satisfy a
McDonald's craving. But now, all of my
drawmates have cars. I rarely see them.
Each is off on her own highly important
Rite Aid run for cotton swabs. Or dash

ing to Safeway for tortilla chips and
salsa.
There is a divide between the "haves"
and the one "has-not" that just can't be
bridged. Trips downtown were once a
treat. Now they are no big deal. Hop in
the car. Done. The bonding is now over
whose turn it is to drive and the great
gas mileage with such and such a car. I

sit quietly in the back seat and wish 1
had my own car. Oops. 1 wish I was on
the Marguerite.

"Morality" overused in
discussions on Cuba
I was delighted to read Isaac kos-
Read's and Nathaniel Joseph Klemp's
letter ("Looking at Cuba in perspective
and from the inside," May 8) about their
experiences in Cuba. It was a noble
thrust against petrified ideologies that
have long dictated American attitude
toward Cuba. Also, it proved a valuable
reminder that nothing can substitute for
direct experience.
I was particularly happy that the let
ter moved between a short term paper
and an informed piece of journalism.
Tim opens up a very promising path for
future Daily contributors to bring out
the best of their academic training.
As for the U.S. embargo, 1 find that
the word "morality" is positively abused.
An embargo is an act of sublimated vio
lence and it should be used with caution
and only to bring about very specific
results.
Everybody knows that the 40-year
old U.S. embargo on Cuba is an out
right failure and an embarrassing
reminder of doctrinaire foreign policy.
Its purpose was to precipitate Castro's
downfall, not to punish Cubans for tol
erating him. lias Castro been removed
after all these decades of embargo?
Has Saddam been overthrown after
nearly a decade of embargo? Has Milo
sevic stepped down after a year of
embargo?
Morality is neither a straight yard
stick nor a rod of punishment. Ii should
be galvanized by compassion, not by
curses and hatred.
fhose who cannot let a day pass with
out cursing Castro and his communist
state should perhaps return back to
Cuba and fight and risk their own lives
to overthrow a suppressive regime, as
Castro himself did in the 19505, lie suc
ceeded; they may succeed too.
Fidel Castro is neither the psychotic
Hitler nor the blood-thirsty Pol-Pot.
Whether we like it or not, he made his
tory and is now part of history. No male
diction can change that. We need to

overcome the Cold War complex and
see tilings "in perspective," as kos-Read
and Klemp propose.
History has vindicated the compas
sion and magnanimity of Willy Brandt's
"Ostpolitik," Jimmy Carter's "Camp
David," and Gorbachev's "Perestroica."
I he next U.S. president will be left with
hardly any excuse to continue the long
discredited embargo on Cuba. As ii has
turned out, it is entirely in the hands of
the people of Cuba to demand a demo
cratic government and civil rights. Let's
hope they will have them soon. Better
hope than hate.

Wearing bike helmets a matter
of life and death
Well, finally we have some attention
brought to one of the biggest problems
on campus: bicycling. It is amazing to
me how so many "intelligent" peo pie
can come together and make such a
mess out of getting to ( lass, glacis and
undergrads alike!
Although I indeed am a graduate stu
dent. I also am an avid cvclist and I cycle
to school a lot. I will admit that as an
undergraduate I would have thought it
ties uncool at first to think about bike
safety, or to wear a helmet or have a
light (but I walked to school anyway).
file epitome of that attitude is exem
plified in the following: one day I was
having office hours when a student

bladed in. He had noticeable scars on
his legs and knees, from a blading inci
dent. When I asked if he had a helmet
on (since it was clear he had no pads on)
the response was a hearty guffaw fol
lowed by, "Only dorky grad students
wear helmets!" Then he saw the helmet
on my desk! Anyway, 1 thought to
myself, "1 am older but wiser indeed!"
I used to wear helmets only on
cycling excursions where 1 would be
going over 20 mph for lots of the trip.
Riding around this campus convinced
me otherwise. I don't care how careful
you are, if someone hits you on your
bike, you may be in trouble.
Someone hit me with their bike while
I was on my bike (his fault!), and he took
a nasty spill and his head landed on a
sewer grate on Escondido Road. The
old fellow had a helmet on, which was
totally smashed. After seeing that and
the reckless abandon of the cyclists
around campus, whizzing through the
Quad, blowing past the clock tower, 1
wear a helmet around campus, even if it
messes my hair up.
Often when I walk I wish I had my
helmet on, too. When I was a teenager,
I nailed an old lady who was walking, as
I turned a corner where a truck was
parked (so we didn't see each other). 1
wasn't going too fast, Init I gave her a
hell of a scare and a nasty bloody gash
on her head. She could have died il I
were going faster. 1 hat's more serious
than getting to class on time or looking
cool without a helmet on.
I lie problem is that people are often
selfish. They are rushing to class, lor

example, and nothing else matters. But
this is not a reason to leave the bike sit
uation as laissez-faire as it's been in my
tenure here. 1 think the debate should
focus on WHAT will be done, not
whether something should be done,
since it's obvious to anyone who thinks
outside the box of their little world that
there are problems that need be
addressed. Those problems won't go
away because Stanford students think
they are "smart," since we smart people
mess things up on a daily basis!
