## Comeback tests tennis star 
### SAMEER AHMED STAFF WRITER 
Muhammad Ali, the boxing leg
end now stricken with Parkinson's
Disease, believes God tries to hum
ble great champions.
Perhaps
that's what
happened to
K.J. Ilippen-
One day, the
sophomore took the
court as the No. 1 men's
collegiate tennis player in the
nation. I he next, he lay in an in
tensive care unit, wondering if he
would keep his spleen and his
dream to travel in space.
On Jan. 14, during his first
match as the nation's top player,
Hippensteel was dominating
USC's Daniel Langre 4-0 in the
first set when he "hit a wall" at the
National Collegiate I ennis Classic
in Thousand ()aks.
"All of a sudden my stomach fell
really bloated," Hippensteel said.
"I could only last three shots a
point, and 1 would keel over."
While assistant coach John
Whitlinger just told 1 lippensteel to
keep lighting and "blast through
the wall," his body could take no
more, forcing him to retire at the
end of the second set.
A lew hours later, I lippensteel's
father rushed him to the emer
gency room. Diagnosed with a rup
tured spleen caused by a severe
(,ase of mononucleosis, Hippen
steel hoped his tennis season, one
that began phenomenally, would
not be over.
During the fall tournaments,
1 lippensteel rose quicklv to the top
ofcollegiate men's tennis. Filtering
the ITA Ail-American Champi
onships, the second leg of the colle
giate Grand Slam, unseeded and
ranked No. 26,1 lippensteel reeled
off six straight set victories to c ap
ture the title. The wins eventually
catapulted him to the top of the

rankings.
"Once I started rolling in that
tournament, my confidence just
grew," Hippensteel said. "I
thought [the tournament win]
could put me up in the top 10, so 1
guess being one was kind of a sur
prise."
Winning the ITA Ail-American
Championships initiated an ex-

cellent start to Hippen-

steel's sopho
mo r e

year at
Stanford.

Ile was fea-

tured in Sports

Illustrated's "Faces

in the Crowd" and
named the ITA Player of
the Month for October.

A month later, 1 lippen
steel teamed up with fresh
man David Martin to

capture the doubles

title at the ITA Re
gionals. Hippen
steel seemed un
beatable.

L 1 n til his
spleen ruptured.
At the hospital
in 1 housand Oaks,

the doctors pro
posed to remove 1 lip-

pensteel's spleen.

Luckily, Hippensteel's fa
ther, a doctor himself, was there to
offer a second opinion, which not
only saved Hippensteel's tennis
season but also his dream of be
coming an astronaut.
Hippensteel, a human biology
major, hopes to follow in the foot
steps of Scott Parazynski, a two
time Cardinal water polo national
champion who recently accompa

nied John Glenn in space as a
physician. If he wants to do that,
Hippensteel said, he has to have a
spleen.
After five days in the ICU, Hip
pensteel and his spleen returned to
The Farm prepared to begin the
two-and-a-half-month rehabilita
tion process.
"I think [the illness] definitely
opened my eyes," Hippensteel
said. "If the tear was a little bigger,
I could have died out on the court.
1 just tried to look at the positives
[of the rehab process]. Taking time
off made me realize how much 1

loved the game and how
much I missed it."

Wh en
he finally re-

turned to
th e

court, Hippensteel struggled. Be
cause he didn't have the stamina to
play an entire three-set match, he
dropped many of his matches.
Despite the losses, Hippensteel
remained positive because lie
