# Baseball crushes Gaels
## Stanford now must sit idle as Pac-10 rivals try to claim first place 
### BRETT KAUFMAN STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford baseball
team would love to continue
beating up on its opponents.
Trouble is, it won't get the
chance for a week.
After the Cardinal (39-12,
15-6 Pacific 10 Conference) de
feated the St. Mary's Gaels last
night at Sunken Diamond 7-0
behind several dominating
pitching performances, Stan
ford can only watch this week
end as its two closest Pac-10
challengers take aim at its first
place position.
With UCLA sitting one half
game back of the Cardinal and
No. 4 Arizona State just one
and one hall behind, Stanford
faces a ill-timed idle weekend in
Pac-10 play while the Bruins
and Sun Devils both host con
ference series.
The weekend off "gives us a
nice break before the big final
league series and the postsea
son," said head coach Mark
Marquess, who added that he is
relatively unconcerned with the
prospect of falling behind this
weekend in the Pac-10. "No
matter what, we're still going to
have to do the job against
UCLA, so I won't be paying too
close attention to the other two
series."
Last night, however, Stan
ford made the best statement it
could in a non-conference af
fair against the Gales (19-32) by
cruising to its shortest game of
the year at 2 hours, 1 minute.
The Cardinal lias now taken 18
of its last 21 contests, including
three in a row.
Junior Jason Young got the

call on five clays' rest and im
pressed with four innings of no
hit baseball. The Cardinal ace
also tallied four strikeouts in a
brief but dominating stint on
the hill that gave him his sev
enth victory of the season and
13th consecutive winning dec i
sion.

Now, Young must wait until
next Friday night to make his
most important start of the year
against UCLA in a series loaded
with league title implications.
"Now that I'm done with this
start, I'm definitely thinking
