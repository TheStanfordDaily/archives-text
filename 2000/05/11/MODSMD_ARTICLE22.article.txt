# Baseball crushes Gaels
## Stanford now must sit idle as Pac-10 rivals try to claim first place 
### BRETT KAUFMAN STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford baseball
team would love to continue
beating up on its opponents.
Trouble is, it won't get the
chance for a week.
After the Cardinal (39-12,
15-6 Pacific 10 Conference) de
feated the St. Mary's Gaels last
night at Sunken Diamond 7-0
behind several dominating
pitching performances, Stan
ford can only watch this week
end as its two closest Pac-10
challengers take aim at its first
place position.
With UCLA sitting one half
game back of the Cardinal and
No. 4 Arizona State just one
and one hall behind, Stanford
faces a ill-timed idle weekend in
Pac-10 play while the Bruins
and Sun Devils both host con
ference series.
The weekend off "gives us a
nice break before the big final
league series and the postsea
son," said head coach Mark
Marquess, who added that he is
relatively unconcerned with the
prospect of falling behind this
weekend in the Pac-10. "No
matter what, we're still going to
have to do the job against
UCLA, so I won't be paying too
close attention to the other two
series."
Last night, however, Stan
ford made the best statement it
could in a non-conference af
fair against the Gales (19-32) by
cruising to its shortest game of
the year at 2 hours, 1 minute.
The Cardinal lias now taken 18
of its last 21 contests, including
three in a row.
Junior Jason Young got the

call on five clays' rest and im
pressed with four innings of no
hit baseball. The Cardinal ace
also tallied four strikeouts in a
brief but dominating stint on
the hill that gave him his sev
enth victory of the season and
13th consecutive winning dec i
sion.

Now, Young must wait until
next Friday night to make his
most important start of the year
against UCLA in a series loaded
with league title implications.

start, I'm definitely thinking

said. "It's a huge series, and to
get the first win of the series
would absolutely set the tone."
Young will throw two or three
times in the bullpen, but not in a
game situation, before the May
19 contest against the Bruins.
"I actually think that this next
week and a half will give me the
chance to work on a few things,
rest a little bit . . . and fine tune
some things, so it will work real
ly well for me," he said.

Joe Bore hard's 14th home run of
the season, coming in the second
inning off of St. Mary's sopho

added an RBI single in the fifth
and crossed the plate himself
later in the inning to lead the
Cardinal offensively.

Gosling continued Young's ef
fective work on the mound,
recording four strikeouts on the
first five batters lie- faced.

a single to left in the sixth — in
his four innings of work and did
not allow a single Gael to reach
second base.
On the season, Gosling now
has an astounding 72 strikeouts
in just 53 2/3 innings pitched, far
and away the highest ratio on the

team. His effectiveness in a
bullpen role will be crucial as the
showdown with the Bruins, and
then the postseason, looms on
the horizon.
Senior John Gall knocked
out his 78th career double in the
eighth inning oil freshman re
liever Brian Shaffer. The two
bagger clown the tight-field line
leaves Gall just one shy of tying
the career Pac-10 record for
doubles. Gall already broke the
conference career hits mark
with a blooping double against
California less than two weeks
ago.
Next, the attention shifts to
Westwood and Tempe, Ariz., as
UCLA and Arizona State try to
climb back to the top of the Pac
-10 race.
Conference opponent Ari
zona has the unique opportuni
ty of spoiling the league title for
both the Bruins and the Sun
Devils, facing both teams on the
road in consecutive weekends
to end the season. So, will the
Cardinal be pulling lot the
Wildcats as it sits at home this
weekend?
"Oh yeah, definitely," said
Young, suppressing a devilish
grin. "Hopefully they can go
down there and steal a couple."
Whether the Wildcats "steal a
couple" or not, Sunken Dia
mond will undoubtedly see an
critical season-ending series
when UCLA travels north to
Palo Alto from May 19-21.
