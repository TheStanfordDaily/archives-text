### BROOKE MORRILL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a third league championship under
its belt alter upsetting UC-Davis at the Final
Four in San Diego last weekend, the
women's lacrosse team looks ahead to the fu
ture of California lacrosse.

Originally, Stanford planned to make this
season its last as a member of the Division 1
Western Women's Lacrosse League. The
team was set to transition into an indepen
dent schedule, playing teams across the
country in an attempt to win a bid to com
pete in the NCAA championship.
Although Stanford has dominated the

WWLL in recent years, claiming three of the
last four league titles, it is ineligible to com
pete in the NCAA tournament.
After much discussion and deliberation
among head coach Heidi Connor, assistant

director l ed Leland, the decision
was made for the Cardinal to re
main in its current league for at
least one more season.
A key factor in Stanford's deci
sion was the restructuring of the
WWLL members and regula
tions. Next year, the Division I
North teams will be Cal, UC-
Davis, St. Mary's and Stanford.
Eliminating UC-Santa Cruz will
reduce the number of required
league games to six and will allow
Stanford to be more llexible in
scheduling competitive games
outside of their league.
"Obviously, the competition
level in our league is continuing
to increase. The restructuring
keeps things extremely competi
tive and worthwhile, while still
giving us a championship struc
ture at the end of the season,"
Connor said.
Team members agreed.
"Being a West Coast team,
staying in the league makes the
most sense because in order for
our team to grow and improve,
California lacrosse has to grow
with it," co-captain Rachel Gal
lagher said.
In the coming years, Stan
ford's goal is to help establish a
Western conference, either Pac
-10 or Mountain-Pacific, that
would have six Division I teams.
"With the NCAA looking to ex
pand the pool of bids that go out
to Division I lacrosse, it is in our
best interests to continue working
toward conferencing in the near
future," Connor said.
Currenlty, the NCAA awards
automatic bids for the champi
onship to two conferences — The
Ivy League and the Colonial Con
ference. Until the Cardinal
reaches that point, it still wants to

strive for its season goal of push
ing toward a championship at the
end of each year.
"Ultimately, we want to be a
part of a conference that is recog
nized by the NCAA so we can
challenge for one of the twelve
bids to the championship," Con
nor said. "We're definitely get
ting closer."
Over the past two seasons, the
women's lacrosse team has made
a commitment to increase the
number of non-league games
while traveling across the country
to compete against nationally
ranked teams. The coming sea
son is no exception.
Connor has already lined up a
challenging schedule for next
year against powerhouse teams
like Cornell and Vanderbilt. The
team will also play teams such as
Davidson, Bucknell, Connecti
cut, Denver, Boston College and
Lafayette.
"This team is so young, and
their potential is indescribable,"
Connor said. "The future is
bright for Stanford lacrosse."
The Cardinal also have
tremendous nation-wide talent
heading its way this fall. Incom
ing freshman goalies will be Sara
Shamos from Colorado Acade
my and Christina Saikus from
Hathaway Brown. Other re
cruits entering the team this fall
include Katie Grubb from the
Hotchkiss School, Annie Nyborg
from Thacher and Noor Da
wood from Western Reserve
Academy.
Stanford is losing four senior
players this year, co-captains Gal
lagher and Christina Cilyutin,
Judy Fongand Hedy Born.
"I've had an excellent four
years on the team and am jealous
of the players who will return this
fall. The team continues to grow
and has incredible potential to
strongly compete with nationally
ranked teams," Gallagher said.
