# Third-place finish unsatisfactory for water polo women
## 
### ELISSA KESZLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's water
polo team ended their season last
week with a bittersweet third
place finish at the national tour
nament.
Bitter because it couldn't exe
cute its high expectations and
reach its season goal; sweet be
cause of a third-place finish in the
nation — won with a victory over
archrival California — and an
overall season record that topped
all previous Cardinal teams' ef
forts.
"This season felt somewhat
like a double-edged sword," said
junior Ali Riddell. "We worked
hard, had incredible team chem
istry and had a lot of success
throughout the season. But we
failed to get what we wanted most
in winning the nation title."
Going into this 2000 season,
four teams clearly topped the na
tion: California, Stanford, I CLA
and USC. Coaches and players
throughout the water polo com
munity knew that the national
title at the end of the season could
go to any of the four.
The teams beat up on each
other throughout the season. In

the end, it was UCLA, the team
that happened to string" together
the best set of victories in Indi
anapolis, Ind., that emerged the
victor, the same I ( LA team that
Stanford happened to heat three
time during this year's season.
"People have been congratu
lating us on our third-plate fin
ish. While third in the national is
a great achievement, we all want
ed more, Riddell said.
Despite the semifinal loss to
USC last weekend, Stanford
showed tremendous success
throughout its season. I he Car
dinal continuously improved
throughout the \ear to take
home the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation title with a 2>S
-5 overall record, the besi in the
team's history since it became a
varsity sport, and it held the No.
1 ranking for the latter half of the
season.
Cardinal team members ( rcdit
their success to camaraderie, fel
lowship and closeness they feel
for each other.
"On paper our team is not
very threatening." said co-cap
tain Hilary Callogly. "We d<> not
have a lot of stars. Our cohesion
knd unity enabled us to beat
teams with far more individual
talent. This year proved what we
could do together and I'm look
ing lorward to next year."
In the end, it is the team that
matters the most to the players.
" This season had a disappoint

ing end, and although that may be
what other people remember, we
know as players, as sisters, as team
mates that our season cannot be
summed up with No. !i," said ju
nior co-captain Anne-Marie
Keenan. "Our togetherness has
been the trademark of our team."
That's what really makes the
hard work and sacrifice worth
while, players say.
"\V'e are family," said fresh
man Jackie Frank. "And no mat

let what we placed or how we did,
we have each other, which is
worth so much more than a na
tional title."
1 his year's team is made up ju
niors, sophomores and fresh
men, and lacks any seniors. Thus,
Stauiurd will return all 13 players
for next year's squad.
Next year will also see the re
turn of Kllen Esies and Brenda
Villa, who redshirted this year to
participate on the United States

National Team and recently quali
fied lor the 2000 Olympics this
September in Australia.
With such depth and experi
ence, and the added incentive of
its third-place finish, Stanford
will be the team to beat in the
2001 season.
"It was frustrating to fall short
of the national title, but this loss
will help motivate us for next sea
sou," said freshman Julie Gard
ner.
