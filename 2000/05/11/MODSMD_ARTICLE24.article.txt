# Third-place finish unsatisfactory for water polo women

The Stanford women's water
polo team ended their season last
week with a bittersweet third
place finish at the national tour
nament.
Bitter because it couldn't exe
cute its high expectations and
reach its season goal; sweet be
cause of a third-place finish in the
nation — won with a victory over
archrival California — and an
overall season record that topped
all previous Cardinal teams' ef
forts.
"This season felt somewhat
like a double-edged sword," said
junior Ali Riddell. "We worked
hard, had incredible team chem

Despite the semifinal loss to
USC last weekend, Stanford
showed tremendous success
throughout its season. I he Car
dinal continuously improved
throughout the \ear to take
home the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation title with a 2>S
-5 overall record, the besi in the
team's history since it became a
varsity sport, and it held the No.
1 ranking for the latter half of the
season.
Cardinal team members ( rcdit
their success to camaraderie, fel
lowship and closeness they feel
for each other.
"On paper our team is not
very threatening." said co-cap
