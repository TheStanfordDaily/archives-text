S 1 he team enters Arizona riding
the momentum of a second-place
linish at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships — an impressive
k-at considering that the Pac-10 is
;ilie uncontested powerhouse in
golf.
However, the finish was not a
ifluke. Over the past several weeks,
,hic team has really tome together,
land every team member has
•proved capable of posting low
•yores for the (Cardinal.
1* 1 he Cardinal has always been
[able to rely on the consistent pla\
yf junior stars Stephanie Keever
Hilars 1 lonieyer, who were
ifecently selected for the third
Straight time to the All-Pac-10
Jklonference team.
In addition to this veteran tal

cut, freshman Kim Row ton lias
blossomed into a serious scoring
threat. She has captured four top
-10 finishes in her past five tourna
ments, including a team-leading
sixth at the l'ac-10 Champi
onships.

Senior JacJean Ko top oil the five
woman (Cardinal team. Mussani, a
transfer student from the I niver

sity of Texas, posted her lowest
tournament score as part of the
Cardinal with a 171h-j>lac e 227 in
the conference championships.

posted low scores for the (Cardinal
this season. I lei recent finishes in
clude a tie for 32nd at the l'ac-10
Championships and second at the
Stanford / San Jose State Desert
Dual.

With every player capable of
carding the necessary low scores,
the Cardinal poses a threat to even
the best collegiate teams. Howev
er, the Cardinal claims that it has
yet to play to its lull potential and
feels that the best is still to come.
"Everyone's working really
hard," Keever said. "We're really
close to playing to our potential as
a team."
