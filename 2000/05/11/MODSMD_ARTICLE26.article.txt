# Science seminars balance Frosh / Soph offerings

### TOMOKO SAKAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At the start of the Stanford In
troductory Seminars program
three years ago, the program had
fin more humanities and social sci
ence classes than in engineering
and sciences.
But engineering and science
departments have answered the
call by the University to add semi
nars. Oflii ials in i lie Freshman and
Sophomore Programs office say
they are now satisfied with the bal
ance ol classes offered in different
disciplines.
I'iie shift has been so dramatic, it
may have appeared that the pro
gram was less interested in human
ities and sex ial s< iences than before,
according t<> some students.
"The particular numbers of
courses ollered in anyone field has
fluctuated a bit from year to year,
but the number of 'fuzzy' (lasses
for the past several years has been
roughly the same, said Sharon
Calmer, director of Freshman and
Sophomore Programs. "There has
not been any effort or plan to re
duce the numbers ol humanities
and so< ial science courses."
in developing the program
since iis inception, "we were care
ful to seek out a balance of classes
that could be ollered from all kinds
ol (list iplincs. ()ur primary job is to
balance student demands and fac
ulty interest," said John Bravnian,
vice provost lor undergraduate
education.
Mechanical Engineering I'rof.
(iodlrey Mungal, who is currently
teaching a freshman seminar titled
" I he Aerodynamics of Sports
Balls," said the Mechanical Engi
neering department responded to
administration requests lor these
seminars to be ollered.
"Previously, the ME depart
ment used to have an odd one here
and there. Now, we are obliged to
teach live |introductory seminars]
each acadenik year," he said.
Mungal attributed the success

in balancing the variety of semi
nars available to the vital resources
that ilie University has been
putting in to encourage professors
like him.
" There didn't used to be a sub
slant ial amount of classes being
taught by our department, and if a
professor occasionally did, they
would have an overload of work,"
Mungal said. "Now that the Uni
versity has put in adequate re
sources that take into considera
tion the time and effort we need to
put into these seminars, I'm no
longer giving it second fiddle. It
gets my full attention as my teach
ing activity."
Classics Prof. Joseph Manning,
who teaches a freshman seminar
called "Decoding Ancient Egypt:
Kgyptian Hieroglyphics and An
cient Egyptian Civilization," said
that more engineering seminars
haven't hurt his department.
"It would be a bad thing if the
rising number of tec hie classes
'crushed' the different voices and
approaches that the humanities
and social sciences have, but 1
don't think that's happening," he
said. "In fact, I think the number
of Classics majors and minors have
increased six or seven percent this
year."
"Stanford has a large scientific
audience, but most of the fat uity
here have a positive attitude to
ward its emphasis on interdiscipli
nary learning," said Manning. "I
think the diversification of semi
nars, il anything, can open up
minds and give a lot to students in
terested in a single or multiple
areas of disciplines. I love Engi
neering majors and Classics Illi
nois because they bring in differ
ent perspectives and are a source
of energy for us."
One visible trend in the intro
ductory seminars is the growth in
the number of sophomore semi
nars offered by faculty in the
School of Medicine over the last
three years.
"These Med School courses

will, we hope, be valuable to the
large number of sophomores who
are enrolled in the Biology or
Human Biology cores, and who
are contemplating a career in
medicine or medical research,"
Palmer said.
Donna Bouley, assistant profes
sor of comparative medicine, who
is teaching a sophomore seminar
called "Comparative Anatomy and
Physiology of Mammals," agreed
that diversifying the variety of
seminars was positive.
There is a "growing number of
pre-meds and pre-vets [among]
freshmen and sophomores,"
Bouley said. "Currently, our de
partment offers one seminar each
quarter, and I love teaching my
class. It's a very positive thing for
students to get exposed to as many
disciplines that fit their interest."
All three professors agreed they
love of teaching a small and com
mitted c lass.
" file idea of small, interactive
seminars is great," Manning said.
"It's fun, lotused and above all,
you gel to teach a captured audi
ence, unlike big lecture classes that
students are obliged to take and
faculty are obliged to teach."
According to Mungal, "It's re
freshing for me to teach a seminar
in Mechanical Engineering, be
cause in a sense, you have to teach
in a different language, without
the math and the physics that you
would normally do in teaching an
engineering course.
"Bin thecjuestions students raise
are good, and it would be great if
our seminars could give a glimpse
of the engineering world to stu
dents who had never previously
considered any related areas."
Student reactions to introduc
tory seminar offerings have been
largely positive as Well.
"The three seminars that I've
taken in Philosophy, English and
History were and are all great,"
said freshman Trevor Sutton.
