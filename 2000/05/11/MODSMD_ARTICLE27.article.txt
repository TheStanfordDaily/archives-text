Statistic s l< )i t lie University of California system's ad

pact ol the 1905 Board of Regents' decision to elimi
nate rac i.tl preferences.
While minority applications have increased over
1998 totals, the numbers still lall short ol those apply
ing foi lall 1997, the last year the UC. schools used al
lii malive .i< lion, according to I he San |ose Men nry
News.
Supporters ol allirmative action are rallying to per
suade the I ( Board ol Regents tooverturn theii policy.
But even il the regents voted to reverse their 1995
ban, it would be merely a symbolic gesture to encour
age minority students to apply and enroll at UC
s< hools. Allii mative act ion would not return because ol
Proposition 209, which was approved by voters in the
slate in 1996.
Prop. 209, which prohibits discrimination or pref
erential treatment based on race, sex or ethnicity in
public employment and education, does not apply to
private entities siu h as Stanford.
"Stanford continues to apply affirmative action to
the three groups as we have done lor the past thirty
years." Senior Assoc. Dir. of Admissions Jon Reider
said. I he three groups are African-American, Native
American and ('.hicano/ Latino students.

During the Prop. 209 debate in 1995, University
President Cerhard Casper issued a statement affirm
ing Stanford's commitment to campus diversity.
"It is the responsibility of educational institutions
such as Stanford to find and educate those who can be
come leaders of the future in a multi-ethnic and multi
racial societv," Casper wrote. "Alas, our society is c|iiite
color-conscious and we therefore cannot yet afford to
be color-blind."
I he Mercury News reported that the most signifi
cant increase in applications to UC this year came from
( hicano / Latino students, with 3,382 applying, up 20
percent from last year. Applications from African-
American students increased 9.7 percent to 1,245 this
year.
One vocal opponent of the ban is UC Regent
William Bagley. He says the 1995 decision has hurt the
reputation of UC-Berkeley, his alma mater.
"Our flagship campuses are becoming more and
more segregated," Bagley told the Mercury News. "I
don't want the UC system tobe known as the Bob Jones
University of the West."
Reider said he believes Stanford will not follow in
the footsteps of the UC system.
"It's not a highly debated issue here," Reider said.
The Stanford policy "works very well."
Of the freshmen who entered Stanford last Septem
ber. 8.3 percent are African American, 9.4 percent are
Latino and 1.7 percent are Native American.
