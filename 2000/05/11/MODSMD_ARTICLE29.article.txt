# Int'l Knight Fellows named
## 
### JENNY MILLER 
Eight international journalists were awarded John
S. Knight Fellowships Tuesday, joining the 12 U.S.
journalists who received the honor last month.
The fellows will live at Stanford during the 2000-
'01 academic year and take classes like regular stu
dents, as well as participate in a weekly seminar with
other fellows.
The fellows have chosen specific areas of interest
that they wish to learn more about while at Stanford,
to build on their experience and interests in journal
ism. Examples include the social responsibility of
businesses and corporations and the status of women
and children in society.
l lie program, which will begin its .'i. r )th year next
fall, receives financial support for the U.S. fellows
front the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.
International fellows are sponsored by the Reuters
Foundation and other individuals and organizations.
According to James Kisser, director of the Knight
Fellowships program, the different sponsors are one
of the few differences between the national and inter
national fellows.
"It's a financial difference; it doesn't make a differ
ence once they're here," he said. "They're all togeth
er as a group doing the same things."
The only other major difference between the two
groups is the application process, Risser said. After
U.S. journalists apply, the l M) most promising candi
dates are brought to Stanford for an interview. 1 he
fellows are then selected based on their interviews as
well as their application.
International candidates are not interviewed as
part of the selection process. "We judge them based
on the materials submitted," Risser said.

Some of the fellows look forward to a break from
their busy lives as journalists. ,
"1 think I was worried 1 would burn out or some
thing," said Jane Armstrong, a national correspon
dent for The (ilobe and Mail in Vancouver, (iana<,l«i.
"1 didn't want to take a year off or a holiday, but 1
wanted to learn something outside of a newspaper
environment."
Armstrong's area ol study will be the siu cesses, fail
ures and future of the modern city, inspired by IJer
previous assignment as a city hall beat reporter Jin
Toronto. *
When she transferred from Toronto to Vancou
ver, she noticed the difference between the t>\ <»
places. '
"Even though the two cities are in the same coitn
try, they're very diflerently organized," Armstrong
said. Vancouver has urban problems that Toronto
has already solved, she said. I
While at Stanford, Armstrong plans to take ni;i)iv
trips to San Francisco to "see how it's structured."
She hopes to gain greater insight into traffic prob
lems, homelessness and other issues that plague frig
cities.
