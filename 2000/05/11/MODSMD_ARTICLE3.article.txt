## 
### DENNIS TYLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Tuesday night, the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate certified
the presidential runoff results,
confirming juniors Seth Newton
and Malia Villegas as the next
president and vice president of the
ASSU.
The election results are still in
jeopardy, as the Constitutional
Council is currently discussing al
leged violations that could over
turn them.
The election certification
means the newly-elected senators
can begin their first order of busi
ness next week: electing a new
chair.
Senior Adam Weiss recom
mended that junior Nikki Love su
pervise the first meeting between
this year's Undergraduate Senate
and the senators-elect, since he
said she took such a strong role in
handling the elections.
"I would like to acknowledge

Nikki Love and Ashok Reddy for
the strong leadership role they
both took in helping with this
year's hectic elections," said Weiss,
the ASSI programming director.
After the runoff certification,
the Undergraduate Senate began
discussing some of the projects
they are working on as the year
draws to a close.
I lie Senate is working on ex
tending Creen Library hours. Ac -
cording to ASSU Senator Serge
Jvassardjian, "we are communicat
ing with [Dean of Students] Marc
W'ais to develop a plan to keep
Creen open for at least an extra
hour."
l lie Senate also plans to ask the
library to change its skateboard
policy. Main senators felt that it
was unfair not to allow students to
bring their skateboard in the li
brary, especially since there are no
lockers available for them to store
them.
Additionally, Undergraduate
Senate Chair Steven Aronowitz,
a senior, suggested that money
from the programming fund be
used to build the Roble theater.
Aronowitz said that the Dean
of Students Office would be will
ing to match the ASSU's funds to
create a theater in part of the old
Roble Dining Hall.

Junior Ben Liu, the Senate's
deputy chair, argued that if the
ASSU provides any money for
the Roble Theater, it should
specify exactly for what they
want the money used.
"The space at Roble is intend
ed as a multi-space center, so
technically it is not a theater. Be
fore we give them any money, we
should state that we only want
this money to be used for equip
ment for the theater. That way,
we can ensure that they use the
money for the right reasons and
not on a sofa for their lounge,"
I.in said.

The Senate also plans to take
an active role in voter registra
tion for the November general
elections. Members of the Sen
ate-elect have agreed to spear
head this project along with
Aronowitz, because they said
they recogni/e the importance
of getting people registered to
vote.
The Senate also conducted its
usual business of approving
funding. Poetry in Motion,
Kappa Alpha Psi, Circle k. Black
Graduation 2000 and High
lighters all received funding
from the ASSU.
