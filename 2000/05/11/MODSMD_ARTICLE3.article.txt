### DENNIS TYLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Tuesday night, the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate certified
the presidential runoff results,
confirming juniors Seth Newton
and Malia Villegas as the next
president and vice president of the
ASSU.
The election results are still in
jeopardy, as the Constitutional
Council is currently discussing al
leged violations that could over
turn them.
The election certification
means the newly-elected senators
can begin their first order of busi
ness next week: electing a new
chair.
Senior Adam Weiss recom
mended that junior Nikki Love su
pervise the first meeting between
this year's Undergraduate Senate
and the senators-elect, since he
said she took such a strong role in
handling the elections.
"I would like to acknowledge

Nikki Love and Ashok Reddy for
the strong leadership role they
both took in helping with this
year's hectic elections," said Weiss,
the ASSI programming director.
After the runoff certification,
the Undergraduate Senate began
discussing some of the projects
they are working on as the year
draws to a close.
I lie Senate is working on ex
tending Creen Library hours. Ac -
cording to ASSU Senator Serge
Jvassardjian, "we are communicat
ing with [Dean of Students] Marc
W'ais to develop a plan to keep
Creen open for at least an extra
hour."
l lie Senate also plans to ask the
library to change its skateboard
policy. Main senators felt that it
was unfair not to allow students to
bring their skateboard in the li
brary, especially since there are no
lockers available for them to store
them.
