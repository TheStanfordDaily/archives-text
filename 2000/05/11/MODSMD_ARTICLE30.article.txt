After an inconclusive meeting I uesday night,
the ASSU Constitutional Council will continue to
debate the six charges brought by members of the
Graduate Student Council.
"The council unanimously agreed that the de
merit system, as it existed during this year's elec
tion, was unconstitutional," said council C -hair 11 ar
ris Shapiro, a doctoral student in physics, because it
violated the tight to confidentiality in the ASSU
Constitution.
The council also determined that certain restric
tions on campaigning found in this year's Cam
paign Practices Code were unconstitutional, in
cluding mandatory spending limits and restricting
a campaign to a single Web site.
The council has the power to invalidate any

acts that may have stemmed from a constitution
al violation. However, the council has yet to rule
on whether any portion of the spring elections
might constitute an "act stemming," or as to
whether these acts were undertaken in good
faith. A vote of good faith by the council can rein
state an invalid act.
On Sunday, the council ruled that the demerit
system governing the elections was not approved
by the Graduate Student Council and was there
fore unconstitutional. According to the ASSU (Con
stitution, all acts that affect graduate and under
graduate students must be passed by both the I n
dergraduate Senate and the CISC.
Since a majority of the Constitutional Council
voted that the act was undertaken in good faith, the
elections were not invalidated.
The council will meet again to continue the
hearings Friday.
