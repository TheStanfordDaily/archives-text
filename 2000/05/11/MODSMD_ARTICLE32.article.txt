# 'Sound' is a lot like the movie
## 
### LAUREN RUSSELL EDITORIAL STAFF 
Although Richard Chamberlain seems to be the headline
star for"The Sound of Music," he is only a small piece of a
grand ensemble which comes together for a show that is defi
nitely worth seeing. If you didn't mind the saccharine flavor
of the original movie, which was released in 1965 and won live
Oscars that year (including Best Picture), yon will love seeing
" I he Sound of Music" on stage. The Von Frapp kids come
through with amazing dance and singing performances, and
the Rogers and Hammerstein story, with its classic songs like
"Do-Re-Mi" and "My Favorite Filings," is hard not to adore.
Fhe musical, which is playing in San Francisco's Golden
Gate Theatre for only two weeks, has already been a smash hit
on the toughest turf for on-stage competition (New York
City), along with the other major cities it has stopped in. In its
original performance almost five decades ago, which the
movie was tightly based upon, the musical won six Tony
awards in 1959, including Best Musical.
Richard Chamberlain plays Captain Georg von I rapp, a
retired officer of the Austrian Navy. Since his wife's death, bis
household of five children lias become more like a military
camp than anything else, and every governess who has come
to discipline the children has given up hope. Enter Maria, the
naive and spunky 19-year-old (played by Meg Tolin) who lias
been thrown out of her abbey because she couldn't conform
to the demands of nunhood. Maria is a hit with the kids, and
with the Captain, who is set to marry the wealthy and entire
ly superficial Elsa Schraeder. Fhe love that Maria feels for the
children and for Captain von 'Frapp changes everyones' lives,
especially her own. T he love story untangles in the midst of
the ever-increasing threat of Na/i occupation, which could
take Captain von Frapp away from the family to fight for a
movement he does not believe in.
While this musical is definitely made for the family audience,
the songs and dance sequences will impress and satisfy any
one. It is hard to imagine a "Sound of Music" without the
authentic scenery of the Austrian mountains and valleys in the
background, as so many of the scenes in the movie occur out
doors. The scenery in this performance was brilliant, however,
and managed to capture the sense of natural grandeur with a
complex and ever-moving set that included not only the moun
tains, but also the abbey, the Nazi-occupied performance hall,
and different parts of the von 'Frapp mansion.
The only negative aspect of this performance was the factor
that is meant to make it strong â€” Chamberlain. It is clear that
he is considerably too old to be playing the romantic male lead
(especially when his female counterpart is 19). Chamberlain,
who I would guess is in his late 60s, hit a few sour notes during

the performance and was no more mobile than the average
senior citi/en. Unless he was overdosing on Viagra, it was hard
to believe that he and Maria had much going on behind closed
doors after the romantic scenes. Tolin's vocal

performance was not exactly up to snuff
either, and her occasionally whiny high-notes
scraped on my nerves like nails on a chalk
board.
Despite this, I highly recommend seeing
"I he Sound of Music," especially if you

["The Sound

ater, San Francisco

enjoyed the movie. While Meg Tolin is no Julie Andrews, she
brings a new, spunky aspect to Maria that decreases the cheese
factor considerably. It is hard to miss the

mark when re-telling a classic story that has
pleased audiences for over 40 years.
"The Sound of Music" is a sure thing,
although tickets aren't because of its short
run time, so if you plan to see the show, buy
your tickets quickly.
