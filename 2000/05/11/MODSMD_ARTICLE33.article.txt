# Brevity, comedy form the soul of 'Wit'

### ZACH UDKO EDITORIAL STAFF 
"It is not my intention to give away 11le plot, bin 1
think I die in the end."
So begins one woman's touching, inspiring and funny
— yes, funny — struggle with cancer.
The notion of a cancer play filled with laughs might
make one a tad queasy. There just doesn't seem to be
much room for chemotherapy in a punchline. (Did you
hear the one about the IV-drip . . .)
But in her first stab at playwriting, Margaret Edison
takes audiences on a I 10-minute intermission-less,
teary-eyed and unexpectedly hilarious journey through
the process of facing disease. Her "Wit" won the
Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1999, and its San Francisco
mounting is never less than a marvel to watch—a true
theatrical experience, filled with pathos, pain, humani
ty, catharsis, and yes, wit. I his critic even admits to
squeezing out a tear during the course of the evening.
Mind you, this critic never c ties. Never.
Nonetheless, it is impossible not to get enthralled in
Edison's deeply emotional world. At its center is Vivian
Bearing (an awe-inspiring performance by |udith
Light), a frigid professor of I7t 1 1 century British poetry
at the height of her career, who has just been diagnosed
with metastatic ovarian cancer. As she faces her mortal
ity, Bearing finds herself forced to transcend the world
of intellect in exchange for emotional understanding.
The scholar's world of the mind proves insufficient
when faced with issues of life and death.
Bearing admits that she enjoyed all the attention she
received from the disease — the medical diagnoses and
examinations — "for the first five minutes, but now 1
know how poems feel."
Woven throughout the piece is an ongoing ode to the
metaphysical poet John Donne, and a debate about a
particular version of "Death Be Not Proud." In one ver
sion, a comma separates "Life" and "Death" in the final

line of the I loly Sonnet; in the other,
a semi-colon takes on the function of
an insuperable barrier. Bearing's
uncompromising grammatical analy
sis of poetry and the English lan
guage allow for several parallels
between her disease and Donne.
Cancer, for instance, is her semi-

colon from the latter translation. She warns us early on
that irony will be used as a literary device in this play
about her life (and death).
Ldison's text is wildly self-referential in a most refresh
ing style. Bearing functions simultaneously as the nar
rator and author of the piece, and when she gets too
sick, she turns the storytelling over to the medical
authorities.
Thrown into the mix are Jason Posner, a resident fel
low in the hospital who prefers research to humanity
(Daniel Sarnelli), Susie Monahan, a friendly and amica
ble nurse (Lisa Tharps), and Bearings own professor
and mentor L.M. Ashford (Diane Kagan), now a great
grandmother. Doctors and lab technicians double as
Bearing's students in flashback scenes.
Judith Light radiates as Bearing. Clothed in only a hos
pital gown and red baseball cap to cover her baldness,
she turns her character into a revelation. Best known for
her work on the television series "Who's the Boss?"
Light has the ability to tug at an audience's heart strings,
invoking all the deepest emotions that theatre can offer.
Light's Bearing certainly has an edge, but there is a soft
and vulnerable core behind the front. Where has this
most talented actress been since the eighties?
In flashbacks, we see Bearing interacting as an
unyielding professor to her intimidated students. Dr.
I'osner, we discover as he examines her reproductive
organs, was a student in Beat ing's Metaphysical Poetry
course. ("God, I wish I gave him an A," she tells us). In
a later segment, we see Beat ing at age five reading a
bunny book by her father's side. Light handles both
quite abrupt changes in character flawlessly.
Sarnelli offers the perfect schmuck doctor to oppose
I harps' gentle nurse. Lagan is the weak link of the
ensemble, but we hardly gel enough of a sense of who
her character is from the slightly flawed script. Also,
one is left asking where Vivian's family is, since Ashford
is her only visitor in the hospital.
But these minute gripes hardly detract from an

incomparable evening of superb the
atre. Director Leah C. Gardiner has
delivered a fine translation of Derek
Anson Jones' original New York pro
duction.
Do yourself a favor and indulge in
this show. Semi-colon. You won't
regret it. Period.
