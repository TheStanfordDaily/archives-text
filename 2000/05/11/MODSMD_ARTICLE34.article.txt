# Movie reviews
## Period piece hurt by poor pacing, casting 
### RANDY MANO STAFF WRITER 
Playing to packed art houses
across America, "Up at the
Villa" has all the makings of
a period classic. Kristin i

Scott Thomas, best known
for her work in"The
English Patient," and Sean
Penn head the list of tal-

ented cast members. Direc- "
tor Philip Ilaas and screen
writer wife Belinda I laas pre
viously gained acclaim for

1996's "Angels and Insects." And
this film is based on a novella by YV

Somerset Maugham, whose track
record includes "The Razor's Kdye" and

"()l Human Bondage." So what
went wrong here?

Kir.si and
foremost, "Ip at

lilt' Villa" has poor
pacing. I'hc crux ol

the storv — that a woman named Man

(Thomas) faces a variety of tempting men while
living in Florence — is alright. The problem is we could
tare less about any of her options. Sit Edgar Swift (James

Fox), a top-ranking British official cur
rentb stationed in India, is cardboard and
under-developed as her potential suitor.
Penn does not look much better as the rab
ble-rouser who has a strongly indepen
dent spirit. So the entire ston is spent with
Man and her men, amidst the onset of
World War 11. and things remain dread
fu 11\ dull.

I lie actors are also mis
cast. Penn has embraced
dynamic characters, from
a death-row inmate in
"Dead Man Walking" to a
colorful musician in
"Sweet and Lowdown."
But Penn looks and acts

out-of-place as the troublesome Rowley Mint, likewise,

Instead, the witty Princess San I-'erdinando (Anne Bancroft)

Despite a talented cast, views of Italy prove the most compelling part of "Villa."



The talented Kristen Scott Thomas proves too light to anchor a miscast collection of
talented actors in the sprawling "Up at the Villa."
