### LAUREN RUSSELL EDITORIAL STAFF 
"1 Dreamed of Africa" is excruciating to w.iuli.
not because il is a bad film, bill because ii is a poten
tially brilliant slor\ complicated I»\ .1 bad script and
blase acting. Ihe drama, set inosth in beautiful
Kenyan wilderness, is speckled with heat t-wi curb
ing scenes tbat make von want to ci v, but that are

sbc is confronted with situations that would change
anyone's life dramatically. Subtlety is a great quali
ty, but lack of any expression whatsoever makes it
difficult to enjoy a movie.
Besides a little bit of Kx-Lax, the film could also
use a plot. I he story is based on the amazing life of
kuki (iallman, although it seems to try too hard to
stiek to the real details, making the film entirely too
long and (I don't believe I am writing this) too much
