## Aqua's latest sinks with no catch tune 
### FLO NOCAR 
Aqua's "Aquarius" (II) is slill of the same flavor as their first,
"Aquarium" in iis Kuro-dance style. If you don't remember or
haven't heard the CI), which was released in 1997, than you are
likely to at least to know the most famous track, " The Barbie
(.ill." I lie Danish band's lead singers are Lene Nystrom and
Rene Dil with Claus Norreen and Soren Rasted mixing the
melodies.
Sadlv, "A(juarius" does not have anything as catchy as "The
liarbie Cirl," Kvery song Iroin the liist, " Cartoon Heroes," to
their last, "Coodbye lo the Circus" is painful to hear. The lyrics
lack imagination and the bubble gum melody gets irritating with
in ISO seconds of listening.
I lie second song on the CI), "Around the World," wins the
prize lot being the most extremely obnoxious song I've heard in
quite some time. With such lyrics as "life is a cowboy song" and
"Yee llaws" interjected intermittently throughout, one has to

worry about sales. Ihe
lyrics make one feel
embarrassed FOR tlie
group.

( \) leels like it belongs within the realm of <S to 1 0 year old chil

simplistic, repetitive and doesn't sustain listener attention for

Aqua seems to be escaping the one-hit wonder status with the
release ol Aquarius. I hope this group does not disappear
overnight, bee ausc- even though the music is per se bad, it still has
a lot of energy to it and the speed necessary for grooving. I lie
