"Appalac In.in Journey" marks the the second lime that the
trio dI Yo-Yo Ma, Kdgai Meyer and Mark O'Connor have
come togcihei I heir lirst collaboration, "Appahu liia Waltz, "
made t lassie .11 musii history when ii was released in 199(). I lie
allium was hailed as one of the lop ten albums of the year by
People magazine, among other accolades.
I he reason lot the praise? Together, the three explored
music in .1 way thai was exciting, ground-breaking and aes
thetic all\ pleasing. Ihe com epl was to interpret various musi
cal styles through the lens of I e\;is fiddle. What resulted is a
stilting mix of soaring melodies, achingly beautiful counter
point, and good ol fashioned country swing.
Ma, one of the most respected and well-known c lassical cel
lists ol modern limes, has been developing a reputation for his
experimentation with different stylistic approaches. It has
been s.iid that his crossover method is vcrv simple: choose a
genre, find the lop musicians in it, and then slay in the back
ground and learn as much as possible.
In thai scenario, O'Connor would be the expert, a I'exas
trained fiddle player. Meyer, 011 the other hand, is just one of
those rare music ians who seems to be at home in nearly every
genie. I lis past forays have included jazz, bluegrass and c las
sical.
011 "Appalachian Journey,' the trio pick up right where
the) left off on the first album, and then move forward. Proof
of their musical growth over the four years between albums,
11 it- new collaboration firmly trumps the old in emotional
power, quality of interaction, and simplistic beauty.
Over the years, the music ians have grown more adept at
embracing the richness of folk music. The songs range from
light and lilting to slow and mournful, from a toe tapping
country number to a heel c lic king Celtic tune. Cuest appear
ances by Alison krauss (who sounds remarkably like F.nya)
and James Taylor (who sounds remarkably like, well, James
Taylor), serve to give the album added crossover appeal.
Kacli year, a mere handful of truly great albums are pro-

du< ed. "Appalachi
an Journey" is one
of tliose lew. Willi
( harm enough to
ioik 11 anyone who
loves music, this
album deserves all
the praise it ran
get.
