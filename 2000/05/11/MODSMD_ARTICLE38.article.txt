# Rollins, bringin' back da punk
## 
### JUNG LAH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last Saturday night at
the Maritime Hall in
San Francisco, Henry
Rollins burst onto the
stage in all of his huge,
tattoo-chested glory and
barked out to the audi
ence, "Let's get it on."
And get it on he did,
through a set of mostly
new material which
pleased the mostly
older crowd of Henry
fans come to see Rollins,
first non-spoken-word

live show in years.
This show came at the tail end
of a lour in support of Rollins
Band's new album "Oct Some (lo
Again," released last February,
and the night, which started out
with boring opening band Apart
ment 29's fusion of metal and
elect ionic a, quickly got going
when Rollins Band came on
stage. The group furiouslx ripped
through countless songs of pure
hard rock and heavy noise, and
one tiling was glaringly clear:
I lenry was back.
For those unfamiliar with
Henry Rollins, the stor\ goes
back to 1981 on a sumnici night
in Huntington Beach when then
-20-year-old Rollins became the
new singer of notorious 1..A.
punk band Black Flag. With
Rollins at the helm, Black Flag
helped usher in an era ol new
ferocity in what had been becom
ing a tedious punk scene ;it the
time. Their record "Damaged"
was eventually named to Rolling
Stone's "Definitive List of the 200
Essential CDs ol the Rock 8c Roll
Era."
Since then, Black Flags disin
tegration led to the first incarna
tion ol Rollins Band, followed bv
several albums, a hit single in
"Liar," a ( >rammy nomination, an
appearance at the second Wood

stork, .iiul an operation in 1997 to
have a cyst removed from his left
vocal cord. Other Henry Rollins
projects included publishing mul
tiple tour memoirs, starring in
films ranging from the
Pacino/DeNiro vehicle "Heat" to
the lowly Charlie Sheen "movie"
"The Chase," and founding a
publishing company called
2.1 .TO 1 (I lis birthday).
When Rollins Band separated
alter 1997's album "Come In And
Burn," Rollins eventually teamed
up with pre-existing LA trio
Motliei Superior to form a new
Rollins Band, the foursome who
performed in San Francisco last
weekend.
Ouitarist Jim Wilson, bassist
Marcus Blake, and drummer
Jason Mackenroth provided
strong support for Rollins,
whether he was streaming his
vocals with rage or gently offering
political commentary through
spoken word. Mackenroth's
relentless drumming and Blake's
funk-driven basslines were
impressive, but this was tilth
Rollins' show, as his massive
frame engullcd the stage through
song alter song, often without
breaks in between. Rollins' live
presence made the band's some
what mediocre recorded material
come to life. I lie opening num
ber. "Illumination," set the tone

lor the rest of the night: tempo
changing rhythms, hardcore
power chords interspersed with
guitar harmonics, and Rollins
growling at the mic through
every note. The song "1 Jotter and
Hotter" was an excellent speed
punk offering co-written by
Wayne Kramer of MCS, and the
hand's cover of fhin Lizzy's "Are
Yon Ready" was an homage to
one of their influences as well as a
thundering interpretation of the
hard rock classic.
At several points during the
set, Rollins stopped to chat with
the crowd, indicating his disgust
lor PC-driven politics and anti
rneat-eaters all at once In saying
he wouldn't mind cooking up
some Republicans to eat. And
w hen one lim got up onstage only
to be roughed up by some bounc
ers, Rollins commented, "I lev, go
easy on him, he reminds me of
Kevin Costlier." Before playing a
song entitled "Your Number Is
One," Rollins lashed out against

people who advocate the unity
driven message of "we are all
one." "Can't we each be our own
person?" Rollins asked, to cheers
from the crowd.
The new songs are deliniteh
more rock-oriented than the funk
influenced material off of their
"Weight" record, and songs such
as "Love's So Heavy" and "Cet
Some Co Again" follow a particu
lar formula of bass-driven build
ups and time-shifting choruses,
all complemented by Rollins'
omnipresent snarl. "I'm a mon
ster, no need to fear me," Rollins
sang out on "Monster."
"Don't let this time go wasted,"
he continued, demonstrating one
of the central themes of Rollins
Band's material: for all of Rollins'
physical presence, he isn't some
one you should be intimidated by.
Indeed, judging from the
strength and fury of his latest per
formance, we would all do wiselv
to heed their album's title to get
some and go again.
