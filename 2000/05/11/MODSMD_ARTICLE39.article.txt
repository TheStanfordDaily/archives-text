# Brit band still thumpin' out the sermons

### MICHAEL BAER STAFF WRITER 
You remember Chumbawamba, right? "1
get knocked down, but I get up again/ No
you're never going to get me down." Flic
most unlikely mass hit and soccer chant
ever, the song " I übihumping" make rich
blokes out of eight anarchists who had spent
the previous 1 years criticizing the
hypocrisies and inequities of modern capi
talism, through .i \ a rift \ ofalhums or public
acts.
"WYSIWYG" - short lor "What You See is
What You (iet," and their lirst 1 .P of original
material since 19i)7's smash " I übthuinper"
— is no exception to their political rantings.
This time they focus theii critiques on this
side of the pond.
Fhe title is meant to be ironic, for most of
the album basically says we Americans solve
most of our problems by pretending they

don't exist — problems like poverty, rape,
hate, guns, (Joel, sexuality, and actually deal
ing with other people humanely. Gated
communities, hoy bands, Disney, "Friends,"
Tipper (lore, Rupert Murdock, Mayor Giu
liani, Jerry Springer — and their respective
audiences — are all symptoms of America's
inability to lace reality and embrace freedom
over cash.
1 his, ai least, according to the First Church
of Chumbawamba. But (he most important
question: "Clan I dance to it?" Well, yes,
though the album is a lot more album-ori
ented and single-unfriendly than its prede-

cessor. The songs do have
that st ick-in-your-head
quality that made
" 1 übthumpiug" the most
loved (or hated) song of
1997.
It doesn't move too far
from that signature

sound, though it does get a bit more eclectic,
lotting Chumbawamba's folk, country, classi
cal, and punk tendencies seep through at
times. I he obvious single — "She's Got All
I he Friends That Money Can Buy" — is one
ol several songs that could be accused of tak
ing potshots. But there's a lot of thought
provoking social criticism embedded in both
the lyrics and the extensive liner notes for
\V\ SIWYG," so the potshots are excusable.
And "WYSIWYG" succeeds where so many
others fail: as a cutting and concise (and
decipherable) social commentary you
wouldn't feel too odd putting on at a dance

party. Or laughing to. Or
cooking to. Repeatedly.
And it's a cohesive album,
in spite of its eclecticism,
liven for a decidedly non
anarchistic person such as
myself, that's my idea of a
great album.
