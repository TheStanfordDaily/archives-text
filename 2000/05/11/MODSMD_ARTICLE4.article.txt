# Hospital merger Casper's big regret
## 
### DEENA SKOLNICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"There can be no doubt that nothing has been
more difficult, more disturbing and more disap
pointing in these eight years than the pursuit and
the failure of our effort to be bold in dealing with
market conditions and governmental policies that
strongly disfavor academic medical centers."
The words of University President Gerhard
Casper, from his final State of the University addles


Editors note: Today, The Daily begins a series looking back
at the tenure of outgoing University President Gerhard
Casper. Each week, u'e will reflect on a major issue that has
marked his presidency. Today, we review the failed merger
of UCSF-Stanford Health Care.


The Stanford Daily File
Departing University President Gerhard Casper cites the failed merger of Stanford's hospital
(above) with UCSF's as the most disappointing element of his eight-year tenure.
in March, reflect his personal
struggle during the merger, and
subsequent dissolution, of UCSF-
Stanford I lealth Care.
At the time of its inception in
1997, the merger promised a
bright future for health care in the
Bay Area.
But the merged health care en
tity lost over $(i() million in the
1998 fiscal year. Losses continued
and eventually led to the end of the
merger, on April 1 of this year.
Historically, academic medical
tenters have received a large por
tion of their funding from the
Medicare program.
I he 1997 Balanced Budget
Amendment's reduction in
Medicare reimbursements hurt
many academic medical centers,
including Stanford's.
UCSF-Stanford was founded

that year to combat this loss of
funding.
But the combined entity could
not avoid huge losses, the majority
of of which were attributed to
UCSF's Mount Zion Medical Cen
ter. Even after the closing of
Mount Zion's emergency room last
December, which saved $15 mil
lion, Casper and UCSF adminis
trators set the process iti motion
later that month to dissolve the
merger.
According to Mike Lassiter,
press correspondent for UCSF-
Stanford, the merger was doomed
by Medicare cuts, a lack of funding
from the state, difficulties with the
managed care market and a fail
ure to create a merged-company
culture.
UCSF-Stanford is currently in
the process of re-hiring its em
ployees and filling vacant posi
tions, according to Melodie Jack
son, director of news and public
affairs for Stanford University
Medical Center.

Recently, Vice President of the
Medical Center Eugene Bauer an
nounced that Stanford Hospital
and Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital will fall under the leader
ship of Malinda Mitchell and
Christopher Dawes, respectively.
Additionally, Casper announced
the members of the new boards of
the two hospitals.
"Now Stanford Hospital and
Clinic are turning inwards, getting
focused," Jackson said. "There's a
sense of relief in some ways that
[the merger] is over, and a good
sense of regrouping and wanting
to come out strong from here."
According to Jackson, there are
still some joint funds and shared
contracts that need to be divided,
but, for the most part, both med
ical centers are once again inde
pendent.
Casper cited three reasons for
breakup of the merger.
Following the 1997 amend
ment, Congress votes every year
on how much money to allocate to

academic medical centers. Casper
said he sees this strategy as particu
larly harmful, since it reduces the
Medical Center's ability to plan for
the future.
"We fall victim to the vagaries of
the annual appropriation process
and can never plan from year to
year," Casper said. "Sometimes I
say it would be better to have less
money but to know for sure it's
coming for five years because then
we can plan on that."
Casper offered the alternative
solution of a governmental entitle
ment program, whereby a fixed
amount of money would be allo
cated to the Medical Center for a
period of several years.
A second factor contributing to
the merger's failure is the role of
managed health care. According
to Casper, managed care is "simply
not interested" in supporting aca
demic medical centers.
The third problem Casper cited
was that the state of California does
not adequately reimburse Stan

ford for the care it gives to the poor
and uninsured.
"Many of them actually do get
care by coming to our emergency
room and receiving it, and then
nobody will pay us adequately for
rendering that care," Casper
said.
"In the last year of UCSF-Stan
ford, the two [medical centers] to
gether were under-reimbursed to
the tune of $80 million by the state
of California and Medicare."
Casper said he thinks the future
looks bleak for Stanford Medical
Center and for academic medical
centers in general if things follow
their present course.
"1 believe there is no hope, no
real hope, that anything will sub
stantially change with respect to
1 IMOs and the way managed care
will consider academic medical
centers ... I think if the federal
government and the states do not
find new ways of financing acade
mic medical centers the situation
will remain very, very difficult."

In the face of this observation,
Casper's proposed solution is to
have the medical center make
choices about which programs it
will keep and which it will down
play.
"It's very hard to say, 'We're
going to drop this facility or de
emphasize it, and instead we will
just put all our resources over
there.' And that's the kind of choic
es we clearly have to make."
Jackson said, "Certainly the
health care climate for academic
medical centers is not a good one."
But, she added, "Stanford Hospi
tal and Clinic has a plan for getting
back on the right track and doing
well.
" They're doing all the things
they should be doing: looking
carefully at where and how they're
spending money, looking for effi
ciencies, making sure that atten
tion to patient care is not sacrificed
in the least, and planning for a fi
nancially strong next couple of
years."
