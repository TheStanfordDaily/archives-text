# Reed's paranoid 'E Key'
## 
### KENNY SHEI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Lou Reed first became famous as the
leader of the 1960s group Ihe Velvet
Underground. Alter the breakup of the
Velvets in H)7(), Reed embarked on a
solo career that has lasted almost thirty
years. Although his catalog is somewhat
inconsistent, Reed puts forth a solid set
of songs on his latest eflbrt, "Ecstasy."
The first song 011 the alburn is "Para
noia Key of K," which has a funky,
almost raunchy sound. Ihe vocals are
distinctly Lou Reed s, although he is not
using his trademark monotone
singing/speaking delivery. Other tracks
on the album showcase different parts of

his songwriting and
singing ability.
One of the stand
out tracks is "Turn
ing Time Around."
A slow and gentle
ballad-like melody is
complemented by

Reeds vocals. For part of the song,
Reed sings in a deep, soft voice. Other
times, he's more speaking than singing,
sometimes almost whispering. But by
the end of the song, he's softly shout
ing.
Throughout the album, Reed sings
about human relationships. But Reed
does not shy away from mentioning
things like ejaculation in his songs.
However, anyone familiar with Reed's
other work should not be surprised
with this; on previous albums, he's told
stories about transvestites, sado
masochism, and kinky sex.
Although a few of the tracks on the CI)
are sub-pat, the album holds together
surprisingly well. Certainly, it would be

unfair to expect
something as seminal
as his work with The
Velvet Underground,
but the album proves
that at 58 Reed still
has not lost his song
writing ability.
