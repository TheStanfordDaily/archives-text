# Band creates own quirky rock niche

### RENEE CANADA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Since their first release five years ago, The Del
gados have made quite a name for themselves in
the British indie-rock scene, performing alongside
such big names as Sonic Youth.
I hough the group's name may be foreign to your
ears, their latest album " 1 he Great Eastern," is an
uncannily familiar collection of songs. Sounding
like the Smashing Pumpkins and The Cardigans,
among others, this Glaswegian band has tapped
into much of what's popular in modern music
while still maintaining a fresh and unique sound.
One aspect of this album that clearly sets it above
the rest is the incredibly full-bodied instrumenta
tion, including accordion, tubular bells, vibes,
flugel horn and flute.
Admittedly, there is some programming and the
electronically warped voices that seem almost req
uisite for modern music thanks to

trendsetters like Beck. For exam
ple, the last song of the album,
"Make Your Move," ends in a
totally unmusical, programmed
crunch of noise. However, The
Delgados throw the listener for a
whirl in songs like "Knowing

When to Run" where distant strings
contribute a tense excitement, and
"Aye Today," where flutes and the
sound of chin ch bells accompany (he
finale chorus bringing an almost wist
ful provincialism to the piece.
"Aye Today," also claims to be one
of the "songs sung out of key" —
which turns out to be an apt descrip
tion of all of the* male vocals. The
album's opening number, "The Past
That Suits You Best," starts off with a
gentle piano melody and the rough
edged vocals of Stewart Henderson,
sounding very much like J. Mascis of
Dinosaur Jr. Throughout the album,
Henderson alternates vocals with and
often harmonizes with the familiar
sounding Emma Pollock — she bears
a striking resemblance vocally to

Tonya Donnelly
on the gently flip
py songs, "Reasons
for Silence" and

"Accused of Stealing." The
rocky vulnerability of Wood
ward and the lightness of Pol
lock may be the reason whv.

even when they are rocking in full swing. The Del
gad os bring a pop sensibility to all of their songs.
My personal favorite was "Thirteen Gliding Prin
ciples" where Woodward and Pollock exchange
lyrics in a gentle waltz-like manner until they break

out into the dark, driving ( horns, followed by tlk
111 it tery runs of the flute. I his song helps to cap
lure what make 1 lie Delgados most memorable
the beautiful, broad strokes the\ paint across the
psychedelic pop canvas.
