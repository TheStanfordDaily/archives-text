# No hope for 'Salvation'

### MICHAEL BAER STAFF WRITER 
The soundtrack for the third of the Crow
movies, "Crow: Salvation," plays not like
the first (dark, brooding, and haunting )
but more like the second (self-consciously
"scary" yet unimpressive). This is not alto
gether unexpected, since

these latter two sound
tracks share many artists
— Filter, Rob Zombie,
Hole, Tricky.
But on "Crow: Salva
tion," these artists are
actually the highlights,

while most songs try, and (sometimes
laughably) fail, to live up to the albums'
dark promise. For example, Hole's cover
of Dylan's "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"
seems rather run-of-the-mill and uninter
esting after their sneering and derisive
cover of Fleetwood Mac's "Cold Dust
Woman" (from "Crow: City of Angels").
Alas, even the presence

of samples from the
excellent "Natural Born
Killers" soundtrack — in
the Infidels' "Bad Broth
er" — can't save this
derivative and ultimately
boringly turgid disc.
