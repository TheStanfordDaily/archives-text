Los Angeles mainstay Fishbone lias released its lat
est record, the first since 1998's "( .him Ghinfs Badass
Revenge," and, according to new drummer John
Steward, the band's most radio-friendly album to
date.

For a group that is 20 years old,
listeners familiar with Fishbone's
fusion of reggae, ska, funk and
punk will not be surprised with this
10-song offering of veritable easy
listening tunes â€” there are no sur
prises or radical departures of
sound. And just by looking at the
list of guest appearances on the

record (Gwen Slefani, George Glinton, Rick James,
Perry I-arrell, Donny Osmond and I lea, to name a
few) it is easy to see how lai Fishbone's influence has
reached.
" I he Psychotic Friends' is an average album, though
certainly not disappointing, maintaining the band's
traditional eclectic sound without exploring new terri
tory. It has plenty of horns, guitar-driven echo effects,

a little bit of strings, the theremin,
and a usual dark undercurrent of
lyrics despite the happy-sounding,
nature of the melodies. The
record sounds nic e but lacks drive;'
check out l9K ( .)'s "The Reality of.
My Surroundings" for a more
definitive take from these South-,
