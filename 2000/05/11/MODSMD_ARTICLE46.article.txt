### ROXY SASS 
"Women are like elephants. I like to look at
them but I wouldn't want to own one."
—W. C. Fields
Miss Sass was the best-dressed woman in the
place. Then again, it helped that she was wear
ing clothes . . .
Miss Sass and a male companion took an edu
cational field trip to a strip clnl) in San Francisco
— Broadway Street, in case yon were looking for
a good place to go strip-club hopping. Strip
clubs line both sides of Broadway, with flashing
lights and pictures of pouty, scantily-dressed
women advertising each establishment and mak
ing it almost impossible to choose only one.
Considering the price, however, Miss Sass rec
ommends you do select only one. Many clubs
give free admission to women, but for men the
prices range from $10 to $30 and up, depending
on the <|ti;tlitv of the dancers, whether alcohol is
sold .iikl the time of day (admission before 8 ptn
costs less). Most establishments require that
guests be at least IK; those that are full bars obvi
ously require an 1.1). showing proof of legal

di inking age.
I nfbrtunalely, the* < lubs are arranged so thai yon can't see
(lie inside until yon pay. Lac king any guarantees about the
(juality of llie experience. Miss Sass decided to follow a
group of 18-year-olds into a flashier-looking club. I lie
birthday boy in the group got in free; die rest paid $20.
Miss Sass thought it might be worth it to see what might
have been the boys' first strip club experience.
In the true spirit of strip clubs, the dancers on Broadway
are completely naked before the music slops. San Francis
< o doesn't have any bizarre i esti ic lion ordinanc c\s sue h as
those recently allowed by the Supreme ( ourt, su< li ;is thai
strippers must keep on a (.-suing and pasties during the
entile dance. 1 his court ruling was based on a correlation
between strip joints and crime, so apparently pasties arc
less likely to rile men up than bare breasts.
I n one town the consumption of alcohol isn't permitted on
the premises of any place featuring nude dancing, lb get
around the rule, the establishment has a "juice bar" that
also features strippers. Imagine a man sipping apple juice
and watching a woman take off her c lothes!
Miss Sass got a Coke and sat in the front row, so dose lo
the dancing stage that she could have I one lied the dancers.
(Keeping the Coke anywhere but the floor soon became
hazardous, the way those strippers moved.) A revolving
disco ball through pieces of light around the diml\ lit
room. I lu- stage, featuring two poles, only held one dancer
at a time. And men were everywhere. Miss Sass wasn't sur
prised.
She was surprised, however, by a giant projection on the

ba< k wall featuring continuous moving scenes of men ejac
ulating onto women's faces, sweaty women licking other
women between the legs, close-ups of a large penis enter
ing a woman's anus, etc. I lie scenes moved so fast that it
was impossible to imagine them as anything close to erotic
in nature. I hey were hardei than hard-core.
Most of the men weren't even looking at this feature. Cer
tainly it made Miss Sass's stomach turn. I nfoi innately, the
endless naked movement in her peripheral vision made it
d if !i< ult to avoid giant ing at the wall. (oncei it rating on the
dancers had to be the best solution.
f'lie dancers didn't look thrilled i<> be concentrated on.
Kach came on stage, rareh wearing more than a G-string
and bikini top, and danced for two songs. By the end of the
first song, her breasts were usually showing, and she
became fully naked soon after. Not a single one smiled
while dancing.
Miss Sass's male companion had expected a night out on
the town that would leave him with a hard-on the si/.e of
the Kmpire State building. Instead, the pornography on
the wall upset his stomach, and he leaned over during one
of the dances to tell Miss Sass, "This is too depressing to be
erotic." He wondered if a "classier place would have fea
tured women starting with more clothes and perhaps bet
ter acting abilities — a fake smile would have been better
than no smile at all.
I'lie women came in all shapes and colors, though white
women were the minority. Some of the women with gym
nastic talent shimmied up the poles naked and hung

upside down, their breasts bumping their chins.
Others just twirled around the poles.
Miss Sass expected to see men hooting and
cheering when the women removed an essential
piece of clothing. The men who actually did this
were actually the rarity, but Miss Sass liked them
the best; they seemed so much more respectful
than the rest of the men in the place who never
cracked a smile.
Miss Sass couldn't believe these men: lean
ing back in their chairs, their arms crossed con
descendingly, acting as if they weren't even
enjoying themselves. Miss Sass wanted to say,
"Look! She's showing you her vagina! The least
you could do is look excited about it!" The
Japanese businessman in his suit looked almost
disappointed with the night's entertainment.
Fortunately, some college-age girls livened
up the atmosphere with their cheerful yells.
They even dropped money on the table, so the
dancers started paying special attention to them,
which made the men in the room start dropping
money on the table too. Thank goodness!
The dancers had three special moves "in
thanks" lor their tips. The particularly large
breasted dancers took the money, put it in the
giver's mouth, placed their breasts around his

head, and squeezed her breasts until the money ended up
between them. Or, the woman knelt on the edge of the
table and rubbed her forehead into his (likely erect) crotch.
flie most dramatic move — usually done by women with
small breasts or to men who gave a large tip — put the
woman's vagina 1 iglit in the man's face! Sitting down on the
edge of the table, the dancer put her legs around the guy's
neck and slithered off the edge of the table toward him.
Quite <i few men must have gotten a view of pierced cli
torises in this way.
Miss Sass wandered back to the dressing room to inter
view some of the girls. (And a man dared to pinch her
behind on the way . . . who dares fondle Miss Sass?) They
women weren't too positive about their jobs. They work
eight hours a day, taking off their clothes and then walking
naked through a room of fully-clothed men, begging to
give lap dances. Would you love your job?
"I used to be a total nymphomaniac when I got this job,"
one woman told Miss Sass. "But now I'm frigid, 112 hate men.
I bate sex."
"Sometimes nice men come here," another said. "But not
often."
"It's just a job," a third woman said. "You just have
remember that. I just look at the men who come here and
think about what scum they are. But it's hard to enjoy it
much. I just take the money and try to forget it."
As Miss Sass left the club, the girl at the door offered her
a job. Sorry, but after seeing that club, Miss Sass thinks
she'll limit her stripteases to tlie bedroom.
