( lie< k out some of these sites

I he best not-for-profit site I visited
011 inv journey to a c leaner soul was
www.thelningei siie.com. I he site

was nothing more than the
name suggested - but I seek miii
pliritY always. I lie site
impressed me with its sobering
data on worldwide hunger,
links to other hunger sites, and
information on local hunger
organizations. But the coolest
thing the site boasted was the
ability to allow users to donate
food to the hungry without

spending any <>1 their own 'hard
earned' money. It's a decidedly
American answer to the hunger prob-

Icm: view advertising In sponsors, and they will donate Ibod
for you. All with one click of a button. And you can do it
daily.
Don't stop with hunger. I here are more problems in the

destruction of the worlds' most genetically diverse forest
lands.
In fact, don't stop with the rainforest, either. Check out
www.freedonation.coni, and you can make a free daily dona
tion for causes including Al l)S and education. ()i < lick some
money on over to those starving artists for once, huh? And
then buy your gilts online through www.care2.com or
www.greatergood.com. Both sites have an extensive selec
tion of name brand sites that you can btiv assorted goods
from, and if you do so, they will donate money to a charity
of y our choice.

1 1 in in... Mothei 's day approaches - all you with mot hers out
there could do a double good deed lor the holiday. A boring
but well-done site comes from the National Coalition lor the
Homeless at nch.ari.net. Recent news in the homelessness
arena supplements alerts and policy changes that were all
pretty interesting. These guys are taking the issue seriously,
and there should definitely be more of that in the world
today. If you ask me and all.
In terms of name-brand health organizations, the internet
presence was less impressive, www.salvationarmy.org was
notable because of a sec tion of the site that allows users to
pick spec ific regions for news on disasters.
I understand laziness, I do. But I've spent hours being lazy
in front of the television, and still managed to < lick the chan
nel button 011 the remote throughout. So I know that I will
be able to lift that same linger and click a button now that I
know about these sites. Hopefully you will, too.
