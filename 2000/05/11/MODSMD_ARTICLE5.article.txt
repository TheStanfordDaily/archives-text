# New student union unrealistic

### JESS DANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Every spring students demand and ASSU
politic ians discuss a "better Tresidder" or "a new
student union."
But the possibilities are limited.
According to ASSU Vice President John Mills,
plans for a new student union are not included in
Stanford's General Use Permit application.
When approved by Santa Clara (bounty, the plan
will govern what can he built on campus tor the
next 10 years.
Though Mills said he would like to see a true
student union constructed on campus — includ
ing a game area, a performance venue, an art
gallery and more student meeting space and eat
ing options — he admitted that demanding such
a place is unrealistic.
As Dean of Students Marc YVais explained,
"The challenge, however, is to maximize Tresid
der, by offering students as much as possible
within the confines of the structure."
Outgoing ASSU President Mike Levin and
John Mills mentioned the issue in their cam
paign, and helped to institute the Stanford After
Midnight program along with Wais.
Under the plan, many Tresidder vendors
have increased their hours of operation to better
accomodate student schedules, according to
Mills.
In the future, said junior and incoming ASSU
President Seth Newton, "We feel the greatest
changes we can make for a more student-friend

ly Tresidder will be in putting students with vi
sion where decisions are made."
In the past, there have been thoughts of leas
ing vacant spots in 1 residder to big-name fran
chises such as Blockbuster Video, lower
Records and Taco Bell.
During the spring of 199(5, the I residder
Memorial Union Advisory Board decided to look
for a late-night food vendor to fill the one vacant
spot in Tresidder in response to student re
quests. Both Taco Bell and El Polio Rev showed
interest in leasing the space.
After presenting plans to the students and
other staff of the advisory board, there was ,\
unanimous decision to lease the space i<> El Polio
Rey.
Wais said, "There was a clear favor tow aids El
Polio Rey. The quality of the food was better, ii
was more nutritional and it was a family-run
business. We believed that a small family busi
ness would have mote interest in student needs
than a big chain perhaps."
I he decision to go with El Polio Rey over Taco
Bell was finally reached when El Polio Rey "sub
mitted a superior plan for retail space utilization
in I residder," according to an official statement
from the advisory board.
Also, political protests from students at the
time also had a slight impact on the decision.
Though many students wanted to see a Taco Bell
in Tresidder, Taco Bell's parent company, I'ep
siC '.o, did business in Burma, which has been con-

A übiquitous promise of ASSU campaigners is the re
vamping of Tresidder Union. However, problems with
leases and the General Use Permit make this a virtually
impossible task in the foreseeable future.
