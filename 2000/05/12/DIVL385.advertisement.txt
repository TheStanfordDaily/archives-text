AN EXPERIENCE OF HEARTFULNESS
Ram Dass — International spiritual teacher and author of
the classic spiritual guide, Be Here Now, and How Can I
Help, was a pioneer in introducing a whole generation of
Americans, first (as Richard Alpert) to psychedelics, and
then (as Ram Dass) to eastern philosophy.
Sat SantoUi — Founder of the War Resisters League West
and Creating Our Future. A former manager of the Grateful
Dead and founder of Rainforest Products, Sat Santokh is a
senior teacher of Kundalini yoga.
For the past twenty years Ram Dass and Sal Santokh have
been engaged in an ongoing dialog on spirituality and social
change, the relationship between inner peace and world
peace, and the critical role of spiritual practice in the evolu
tion of human consciousness.
