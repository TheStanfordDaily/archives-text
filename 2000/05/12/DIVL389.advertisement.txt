EXPORT CONTROL REGULATIONS
AND OPENNESS IN RESEARCH
Can they co-exist on a university campus?
Last year, the US Congress placed "scientific satellites, and all related data,
components, software, parts, and materials" on the munitions list for control under
the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), limiting participation in some
aspects of satellite-based research projects to US citizens.
What effect is this having on current research projects at Stanford, and what effect
might it have in the future? What can Stanford do to maintain its open research
environment?
These issues will be discussed at the annual public meeting of the Committee on
Research on Friday afternoon, May 12
from 3:30 - 5:00 p.m.
in Room B-12, Gates Computer Science Building.
In addition, the annual review and endorsement of Stanford's Secrecy in Research
policy will also take place at this public meeting. That policy is available on the
web at http://www-portfolio.stanford.edu/100884
