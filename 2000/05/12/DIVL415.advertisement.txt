Star Mine is driving at the heart of what moves stock prices: changes in the
expectations of a company earnings. Our software objectively measures the
track records of Wall Street analyst forecasts and delivers superior predictions
for company earnings and stock price movements.
We're located South of Market in San Francisco, are funded by Hummer
Winblad Venture Partners, and offer competitive salaries and generous stock
option packages.
We've grown from a handful of people a year ago to over 30 people now,
and have already landed some of the biggest names in the mutual fund
business as our clients. We're rolling out our website this summer, making
this the opportune time to join us!
To apply, please e-mail your cover letter and resume (as text or Microsoft
Word attachment) to jobs@starmine.com.
