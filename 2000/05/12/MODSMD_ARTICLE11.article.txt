An April 19 issue of The Stanford
Daily compares the efforts of the
ASSU to revise the constitution to
other student government's revi
sions.
"Stanford isn't the only university
that has felt the need for a revised
constitution in the last several years.
Both the University of California at
Berkeley and the University of Ore
gon have recently adopted new
frameworks for their student gov
ernment ....
An interesting feature of the Cali
fornia's constitution is the require
ment that all candidates for student
offices 'pass a written examination
on the organization and activities of
the Association.' "
The Bottom Line: If the Stanford ASSU
had a test for candidates, what kind of
questions would it ask?
