## Winds drive fire across Los Alamos 
### 
LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) — Driven by
swirling wind ol up 55 mph, lire rolled from
bloc k to bloc kin abandoned Los Alamos yes
terday, burning scores ol homes clown to their
foundations in the town where the atomic
bomb was built.
Firefighters rushed to save houses as
orange (lames and billowing smoke rose over
the town. Whole neighborhoods were reduced
to ruins, with everything from trailers to man
sions going up in smoke in a bla/e that had
been set by the government to cleat away
brush in the wilderness but raged out of con
trol over the weekend.
I lie wildfire first reached Los Alamos on
Wednesday — forcing the- evacuation of the
entire town — and exploded in size from
3.700 acres to IS,OOO yesterday, fanned l>\
blowtorch wind so strong it made parked cars
sway,
"I can't believe how many homes are gone,"
said Don Shainin, a lire battalion commander
112 rom Albuquerque who came to Los Alamos to
help.
At the Los Alamos nuc lear weapons labora
tory, (lames scorched a research building,
rolled over concrete bunkers containing high
explosives, and came within 300 yards of a
plutonium storage facility. But lab officials
insisted that dangerous materials were pro
tected in fireproof facilities strong enough to

withstand a crash of a 747 jetliner.
"We can assure the country and New Mex
ico that our nuclear materials are safe," said
Lnergy Secretary Bill Richardson, a former
New Mexico congressman.
Fire crews with hand tools and bulldozers
worked feverishly to protect homes by c learing
away vegetation and cutting firebreaks ahead
of the flames. Helicopters dropped water on
the blaze, while airplanes bombarded ii with
pink lire retard.ml.
Clountv Manager joe King estimated that
100 homes burned. Rep. l om I'dall, whose
district includes Los Alamos, said lederal offi
cials estimated 300 to 400.
1 he number ol people evacuated grew ves
terclay to more than 20,000, with residents to the
north and northeast of Los Alamos also fleeing
the lire.
Ilie (ire was set May 4 by the National I 'ark
Service to elcai brush near Banclelier National
Monument, but it burned out of control in the
dry, windv weather. A special National Weath
er Service forecast faxed to the park before
hand said fire-growth conditions were at their
highest.
Park Superintendent Ron Weaver has taken
responsibility lor the lire. I le is believed to have
evacuated and has not been available lor com
ment about whether he saw the weather ser
vice's lax. Yesterday. Weavei w as suspended bv

lilt* Park Service pending an investigation. And
members of Congress demanded an inquiry.
"Somebody made a mistake and obviously
we have to lind out who," Sen. Pete Domenici,
R-N.M., siiid as he visited the lire zone.
"It should never have happened. That's the
only thing I can say unless you want me to
curse." said Cail Bolger, who was forced out of
her mobile home park iu 1 .os Alamos to a shel
ter at a Santa Ke high school.
Whoever made the decision lor the deliber
ate lire "should have known better," Bolger
said. " I his is the windy season. We have it
every year, and 1 think he should have used his
head."
Los Alamos, 70 miles north of Albuquerque,
is essentialh a company town tor the weapons
laboratory, which employs 7,000 people at
buildings scattered throughout the city. 1 lie
town is on a mesa, altitude 7,000 feet.
The lire came out of the Jeinez Mountains
to the west and moved northeast, torching the
west ;md north sides of the city.
As the sun rose vesterday, brick fireplaces
and chimncvs were the onh things remaining
ol some homes.
I lie towering ponclerosa pines of the Los
Alamos (lanvon along the Western side ol town
