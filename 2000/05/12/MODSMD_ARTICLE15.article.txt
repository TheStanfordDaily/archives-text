### 
A I I AN 1A (AP) — 1 luce feder
al appeals judges listened skeptical
ly to both sides in the Klian (ion/a
le/ case yesterday, questioning
whether a (i-year-old boy can coni
prehend an asylum application
and whether it's in his best interest
to be raised in a communist coun
try,
With the chants of sidewalk
demonstrators audible in the
packed courtroom, the judges' per
sistent questioning of lawyers for
the government, Klian's Miami rel
atives and his father pushed the
hearing to an hour and 20 min
utes, double its scheduled length.
The panel of the 11th (lircuit
U.S. Court of Appeals, one step
below the Supreme Court, said ii
would take weeks to decide
whether Klian is mature enough to
seek asylum despite the father's
wishes to take him back to Cuba.
Circuit Judge Charles Wilson,
the panel's only (lliuton appointee,
peppered lawyers for the Miami
relatives about the boy's ability to
understand complex questions on
an asylum application they filed for
him.
"I'm sure Klian (ion/ale/ is a

very bright and intelligent (i-year
old, but he didn't even have the
ability to sign his last name on the
asylum petition," Wilson said.
Before 11 it* government's lawyer
could begin stating his case, (lircuii
Judge |.K. Kdmondson fired oil
"the two problems" he had with
the decision to deny Klian an asy
lum hearing.
Kdmondson, a crew-cut Reagan
appointee, noted that the boy's
great-uncle, Ka/aro Con/ale/, had
custody of the child when the asy
lum application was filed, while his
father was still in Cuba. Also,
Kdmondson seemed particularlv
worried about Klian's fate in Cuba,
twice calling it "a communist, total
itarian state."
Kdmondson added that it is not
uncommon lot courts to rule that
the best interests of a child over
ride parental rights. He likened
Klian to children whose parents
reject medical care for religious
reasons.
Circuit Judge Joel Duhina
asked the attorney for Klian's
lather, |uan Miguel Gonzalez, wh\
he took five months to come to the
United States to claim his son.
