# Newborn baby girl Astha Arora makes one billion for India

NKW DELHI, India (AP) — A
bouncing baby girl named Astha
officially pushed India's popula
tion over the 1 billion mark yes
terday. Her birth was greeted
with both fanfare and concern
over the nation's escalating
growth rate.
Astha — "faith" in Hindi —
was born to Anjana and Ashok
Arora at 5:05 a.m. yesterday,
making India only the second
nation alter (Ihina to exceed a bil
lion people.
With an estimated 42,000
births per day in India, it was
impossible to know exactly where
the billionth baby would be born,
but the government staged the
milestone as part of a public cam
paign to encourage Indians to
liave smaller families.
Astha, wailing, was wheeled
out with her sari-clad mother just
nine hours after she was born to
lace a crowd of government min
isters and a horde of journalists at
Saldarjang Hospital in the Indian
capital. She weighed six pounds
13 ounces, doctors said.
"I feel line," said the mother,
Anjana, weak and overwhelmed
by the chaotic reception. "I'm
happy," said Ashok Arora, who
works in an automotive spare
parts shop Ibi a salary of $50 per
month.
"Don't c rush the baby," Sumi
tra Mahajan, the minister for
women and child welfare,
screamed into her microphone as
nearly 200 journalists swarmed
over the mother's bed. Hospital
guards climbed onto a nearbx bed
and beat back the journalists with
wooden truncheons.
Every measure of progress
India has made since indepen
dence in 1947 has been swamped
by the swelling population: Food
production has tripled, yet many
people go hungry; literacy has

increased, but so has the overall
number of illiterate people.
The government picked May
1 I as the date — calling it "a
moment of celebration, a moment
to ponder." Health Ministry olli
cials, with the concurrence of the
U.N. Population Fund, decreed
that a baby girl born this morning
in the 1,500-bed Saldarjang Hos
pital would symbolically mark the
milestone. Twenty-lour babies
were born in Saldarjang between
midnight and noon.
The choice of a babv girl
reflects another part of the gov
ernment's attempts to change
Indians' family attitudes: promot
ing fair treatment for inlant girls
to overcome traditional biases in
favor of boys.
I he last national census in
1991 said there were 927 women
for every 1.000 men in India.
Health experts said that reflected
a trend in rural and poor areas
that gives bovs preferential treat
ment in food and health care.
Infanticide of baby girls remains a
pre )blem.
The billionth birth was hardly
cause foi celebration. Since its
independence, India has had little
success c urbing its exploding pop
ulation. When it became a nation.
India had .'UK) million people.
"We welcome Astha, but we
should also be thinking whether
she would get an opportunity for
education and health like millions
of Other children," said Mahajan,
the government minister. "Will
we be able to get her the resources
and the opportunities necessary
for her future?"
This morning, a recording by
the state-owned telephone com
pany told anyone who picked up
the phone to dial in New Delhi.
"()ur population has now readied
1 billion. Let's have small families
for a stronger India."
