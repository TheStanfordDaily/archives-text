## The 						Stanford Daily Data gathered from bicycle safety survey central to debate 
### 
THE BICYCLE SAFETY Committee's
recently released survey on bike use
restrictions, bike law enforcement and
education programs is an ambitious
attempt to collect data on solutions to the bike prob
lems on campus. While a number of undergradu
ates have reacted negatively to the survey, it is
important to note that the manner in which the
information is used, not the actual survey, is central
to this debate.
The Bicycle Safety Committee and its survey are
important steps to take toward facilitating the
increasingly dangerous bike, pedestrian and car
traffic on campus. It seems that the portion of the
survey titled "Transportation Demographics,"
where students are asked about their mode of trans
portation and their opinions about bike-pedestrian
traffic, would prove useful in formulating new poli
ties or education programs.

The portion of the sui-vey that seems question
able, however, and which has been lal)eled by some
students as "biased" in favor of pedestrians is "Poli
cy Preferences," which includes questions about
how bike traffic may be restricted on campus. All of
the questions in the section are, indeed, focused on
restrictions that can l>e placed on bikers, and while
some of the questions seem reasonable, others, such
as, "Do you favor a "protective radius" for pedestri
ans, i.e. forbidding bicycle riders from driving with
in a certain radius of pedestrians?" do hint at one
sidedness.
Bikers, unlike motorists, do not have that sub
stantial of a safety advantage over pedestrians with
whom they may have an accident. Bikers may fall
into serious injury just its easily as a pedestrian, so it
seems that some of the questions on the survey
could deal with patterns of pedestrian traffic as well,
and whether or not that has a significant impact on

Published

bikers.
Also, whatever sort of biker-pedestrian dichoto
my students perceive the survey as creating, it seems
that more attention should l)e focused, by both the
committee and students, on the ever-present prob
lems of accidents between bikers. The real problem,
it seems, is not biker-pedestrian accidents, but acci
dents between bikers, and now, with the recent
problems with the Florence M<x>re crosswalk, bikers
and cars. Perhaps some traffic regulations in rela
tion to these specific conflicts could be better
addressed.
Ultimately, however, what truly matters in this
situation is how the results of the bike survey are
used. Members of the Bicycle Safety Committee
seem reasonable about the content of the survey
and the possible outcomes of it. The safety commit
tee's members are undergraduates, graduates and
representatives from the Office of Public Safety, and

it also includes Assoc. Dean of Students Morris
Graves â€” a balanced mix that does not seem to
indicate any division of graduate students and
undergraduates.
Graves said in a May 9 Daily article, ("Bike safety
survey stirs debate among students') that, An edu
cation campaign would have to fail before we
[implemented] an enforcement arm." Graves' com
ments seem to suggest that the primary focus of the
committee will l)e on voluntary or mandatory edu
cational programs that could be instated.
As long as the results of this survey are being
used towards constructive solutions, such as some
type of education or information program concern
ing bike safety, the survey is being put to g<x>d use.
However, drifting into serious enforcement, which
a portion of the survey seems to hint at, is not what's
best for the campus at this point in working towards
traffic safety for pedestrians, bikers and motorists.
