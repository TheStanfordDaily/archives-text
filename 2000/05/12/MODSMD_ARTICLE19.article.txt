# THE 						FLIP SIDE
## Rules of the Road 
### 
A Stanford student's honest
response to some questions
from the bike survey:
Do you favor restricting bicycle riders from
selected walkways or other areas of campus ?
Yes. Bikes are an example of the lib
eral forces tearing our campus apart.

They are evil.
If you answered "yes" to
the last questions, from
which areas should bicycle
rulers be excluded (or
required to "walk" their
bicycles)?
Bikes should be
banned from Santa
Theresa St, Maylield
Ave and Escondido

Rd. Think about it. All the people living
in Suites, Sterling Quad, SlavDom and
Mirrilees would have to walk their hikes
to ( lass every morning. It would be the
best practical joke in years.
I)o you favor a "protective radius" for pedes
trians ?
I support a "protective radius" of 10
feet. And I can picture exactly how this
polity should be enforced. No wait, I
take that back. I can't see how it would
be enlbrced.
How ran / should bicycle traffic be improved
oil campus?
(il .K 5. A one year bicycle safety class
requirement. It could be like (11V and 1-
HLJM, with different tracks and differ
ent themes. You could have "Wheel and
the World" or "Gear Works" or even
"T he Handlebars: Braking Bound
aries". or best of all you could have a
Program in Structured Liberal Kduca
tion where they all live together, eat
together and bike together. Hold on,
we've already got one of those. Hither
way, a new (T.R for biking is definitely
the way to go.
Which methods of enforcement do you favor
for regulating bicycle traffic on campus?
Unleashed Police Dogs.
Should the bikes be subjected to speed limits
on the inner campus? If so, what speed limit?
Bikes should be subjected to a 13
mph speed limit. And there should be
cops with radar guns citing any and all
who break the speed limit. Brilliant.
This plan is definitely going to work.
How do you normally travel on campus
(other than by car or bus)?
I walk all the time. Well .... most of
the time. Alright, so maybe I own a bike.
But it's a safe bike and those few times I
ride it, I always use my hand signals.
If/when you walk across campus, how would
you describe bicycle traffic at Stanford?
I hate the bike traffic. 1 hate walking

with bikes 011 every side whizzing by me.
And they keep coming closer. And I
don't know what to do. And 1 get
scared. They're going to hit me. Mom,
help me, the bikes are everywhere.
Make them stop!! Make them stop! Uh,
sorry about that. I'll be OK. But do you
see what I mean?
If/when you bike across campus, how would
you describe bicycle traffic at Stanford?
I am a responsible biker. Every once
in a while, I'll go a little crazy and stand
on my pedals. Alright, I'll admit it. I
kinda like the danger of riding on cam
pus. It's exciting.
When you drive an automobile on campus,
how would you describe bicycle traffic at
Stanford?
I'm from T.A. Bikers are roadkill.
Have you been hit by a bicyclist while you
were walking?
Yes, and I sought medical treatment
at Cowell Student Health Center. They
told me 1 was pregnant and sent me
away.
Do you use the following bicycle items:
Bicycle license tag or sticker - Yes.
Helmet - I'm an undergrad!
Headlight - It's just .... um...out of
batteries.
Taillight - Huh?
If you ride a bicycle, how would you describe
your own driving? (Don't worry, you won't be
reported).
That's it. I can't take this anymore. I
am a reckless rider. EVERYONE ON
THIS CAMPUS IS! We laugh at people
who walk to class. It's fun. I need the
speed. I pride myself on making it from
Suites to the Quad in 1 minutes 44 sec
onds. I flirt with bicycle disaster. Oh my
God. It feels so good to get this off my
chest.
If you ride a bicycle, which of the follow
ing is an accurate description of your driv
ing? (Y'ou may choose more than one).
/ stop for stop signs — There are stop
signs on the Stanford campus?
/ drive in the bicycle lanes — When I'm
in my car!
/ yield right-of-way to pedestrians — I
ride right in the way of pedestrians.
I use a headlight at night — Oh yeah.
During the day too.
If you have been involved in a collision on
campus involving a bicycle, please explain
what you were doing at the time.
I had four minutes to when my final
paper for my freshman writing class was
due. I turned the corner to enter the
Quad from behind MemChu. As I
exploded into the Quad hallway, there
was this Latin American Studies professor


Jit Bhattariiarya
walking along, obviously not looking
where he was going. I he result was not
pretty, lint it definitely hint nie worse
Than it hurt him. At least we both walked
away lioni it laughing — or was it limp
ing.-' — well one of the two.
hi llic most recent collision in which you were
involved (if tiny), please check one or more of
the following desi riplions:
a. lulling and Hiding - Check, h. Studying
while eating and riding - Check, c Talking
to a friend about lack of sleep while studying,
rating, and tiding - Check.
So there you have it. It's time to face
facts. No new restriction is going to
make hiking safer on this campus, lint
police dogs on the other hand . . . well
i hey might just make a difference.

tion where they all live together, eat
together and bike together. Hold on,
we've already got one of those. Hither
way, a new (T.R for biking is definitely
the way to go.
Which methods of enforcement do you favor
for regulating bicycle traffic on campus?
Unleashed Police Dogs.
Should the bikes be subjected to speed limits
on the inner campus? If so, what speed limit?
Bikes should be subjected to a 13
mph speed limit. And there should be
cops with radar guns citing any and all
who break the speed limit. Brilliant.
This plan is definitely going to work.
How do you normally travel on campus
(other than by car or bus)?
I walk all the time. Well .... most of
the time. Alright, so maybe I own a bike.
But it's a safe bike and those few times I
ride it, I always use my hand signals.
If/when you walk across campus, how would
you describe bicycle traffic at Stanford?
I hate the bike traffic. 1 hate walking

with bikes 011 every side whizzing by me.
And they keep coming closer. And I
don't know what to do. And 1 get
scared. They're going to hit me. Mom,
help me, the bikes are everywhere.
Make them stop!! Make them stop! Uh,
sorry about that. I'll be OK. But do you
see what I mean?
If/when you bike across campus, how would
you describe bicycle traffic at Stanford?
I am a responsible biker. Every once
in a while, I'll go a little crazy and stand
on my pedals. Alright, I'll admit it. I
kinda like the danger of riding on cam
pus. It's exciting.
When you drive an automobile on campus,
how would you describe bicycle traffic at
Stanford?
I'm from T.A. Bikers are roadkill.
Have you been hit by a bicyclist while you
were walking?
Yes, and I sought medical treatment
at Cowell Student Health Center. They
told me 1 was pregnant and sent me
away.
Do you use the following bicycle items:
Bicycle license tag or sticker - Yes.
Helmet - I'm an undergrad!
Headlight - It's just .... um...out of
batteries.
Taillight - Huh?
If you ride a bicycle, how would you describe
your own driving? (Don't worry, you won't be
reported).
That's it. I can't take this anymore. I
am a reckless rider. EVERYONE ON
THIS CAMPUS IS! We laugh at people
who walk to class. It's fun. I need the
speed. I pride myself on making it from
Suites to the Quad in 1 minutes 44 sec
onds. I flirt with bicycle disaster. Oh my
God. It feels so good to get this off my
chest.
If you ride a bicycle, which of the follow
ing is an accurate description of your driv
ing? (Y'ou may choose more than one).
/ stop for stop signs — There are stop
signs on the Stanford campus?
/ drive in the bicycle lanes — When I'm
in my car!
/ yield right-of-way to pedestrians — I
ride right in the way of pedestrians.
I use a headlight at night — Oh yeah.
During the day too.
If you have been involved in a collision on
campus involving a bicycle, please explain
what you were doing at the time.
I had four minutes to when my final
paper for my freshman writing class was
due. I turned the corner to enter the
Quad from behind MemChu. As I
exploded into the Quad hallway, there
was this Latin American Studies professor


Jit Bhattariiarya
walking along, obviously not looking
where he was going. I he result was not
pretty, lint it definitely hint nie worse
Than it hurt him. At least we both walked
away lioni it laughing — or was it limp
ing.-' — well one of the two.
hi llic most recent collision in which you were
involved (if tiny), please check one or more of
the following desi riplions:
a. lulling and Hiding - Check, h. Studying
while eating and riding - Check, c Talking
to a friend about lack of sleep while studying,
rating, and tiding - Check.
So there you have it. It's time to face
facts. No new restriction is going to
make hiking safer on this campus, lint
police dogs on the other hand . . . well
i hey might just make a difference.

real brake. If he violates your 10 ft. protec
tive radius, please e-mail him at jitQyleland
