ol place Stanford is.

the majors are up to par, then
whether students have one or two
majors should not matter.

Advising ('.enter Fori White said
students do not have adequate in
form. it ic >11 to < boose majors.

in a particular sequence."

is widespread dissatisfaction with
the quality of instruction and advis

ing. I le said it is not unreasonable

Professors must be crystal-clear
in their definition ol cheating,
kenislcv said. She said some pro
lessors allow students to discuss
concepts or even problem-solving
solutions while others believe any
discussion is a violation of the
I lonor C lode.
Kemsley said students often
cheat because they panic.
"Many of the students w ho ap
pear to us make a late-night, last
minute decision unrelated to acad
emic matters," Kemsley said.
"We need more dialogue about
what is cheating," Wais said.
