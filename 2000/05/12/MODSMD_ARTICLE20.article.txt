Alum questions Stanford's motives
As most everyone in the community
knows, Stanford lias recently handed
down a decision that all dogs will be
banned from the Dish beginning Sept. 1.
They say they're doing this in the name
of habitat preservation: "Dogs are not
compatible with habitat conserva
tion . .. unleashed dogs have disturbed
breeding grounds and diminished popu
lations of ground-nesting birds and small
rodents that are native to this area,"
writes Jeff Wachtel, associate provost.
I am extremely sensitive about habitat
preservation. In fact, that is one of the
many reasons I enjoy going to the Dish: It
is one of the few unspoiled, safe, undevel
oped areas left that I can enjoy "in the
company of my dog."
Unfortunately, I wish 1 could believe
Stanford's motives were so pure, as I am
an alum, and have always held the school
in high regard. But it is absolutely
IMPOSSIBLE for me to accept this as
Stanford's sole reasoning, when in that
very environment, they allow dozens
upon dozens of cattle to roam freely, trod
on "breeding grounds and ground-nest
ing birds," walk on wet soil and undoubt
edly contribute to erosion with their great
weight.
In fact, 1 believe there's no question

that if the two were compared, the cattle
contribute SIGNIFICANTLY more to
the degradation of the area. Sadly, I
believe that because this land is RENT
ED from Stanford and money is paid,
environmental sensitivity is quite over
looked.
It seems as though when money
enters into the picture, Stanford's moral
ity about habitat preservation goes out
the window. I am one of Stanford's
biggest fans. 1 loved attending the school
as a student for four years; I love living so
near and utilizing beautiful areas like the
Dish.
I can't tell you how disappointed and
hurt I am that this decision was handed
down with so little consideration for the
surrounding community that has con
tributed so much to the Institution. It is a
great blow to all of us. 1 very much appre
ciate Stanford's concern that people don't
obey the leash laws. However, I wish that
instead of banning dogs altogether, they
could respect those of us who "follow" the
rules by enforcing the leash laws, rather
than enforcing the expulsion of people
with dogs. Seems to me it wouldn't
require any more resources.
By the way, if I find that two or three
years down the road, development starts
to creep into the area (and I know there's
much talk of this), my respect for Stan

ford will probably be diminished forever.
It would mean this recent decision is the
first step in an insidious plan to pave over
the Foothills and destroy one of the few
open preserves left, out of self-interest
and carelessness. You certainly wouldn't
be alone; there are many who have done
the same. I guess 1 thought Stanford's
soul was different. What a disappoint
ment.
