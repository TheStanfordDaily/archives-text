## Softball duels Arizona schools 
### EMILY DRESSEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After winning three consecutive confer
ence games on the road last weekend, tlie
Stanford Softball team has squirmed its way
into the fourth slot in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, just ahead of Arizona State.
I hese standings are extremely crucial in
determining overall seeds and post-season
placements, as most of the top Pac-10 teams
are dispersed throughout the country due to
the conference's enormous strength.
On Sunday, the team will find out its re
gional bracket and from there, each regional
winner advances to the World Series. The
outcome of this weekend's match-ups will ul
timately solidify how Stanford ranks among
the best in its conference.
"It's fun to speculate about regionals,
where you're going to get sent and who
you're going to play," said head coach John
Rittman. "But we still have this weekend to
concentrate on. It's tough not to overlook the
(act that we're playing two World Series-cal
iber teams."
This isn't the first time the Cardinal has
faced the two stellar Arizona squads. In
April of this year, the team split two games
with the Wildcats in Arizona, falling 8-4 and
narrowly escaping with an eight-inning vic
tory 4-'*.
Arizona is again expected to peg their ace,
sophomore Jenny Finch, who is arguably the
top pitcher in the conference, against the (Car
dinal lineup in an effort to win the three-game
series.
Lately, however, the Stanford offense has
been demolishing whatever is thrown at it,
top pitcher or not.
Sophomore center fielder Jessica Mendoza
currently leads the team and the entire league
at that with a batting average of .478.
I lowever, sophomore first-baseman Sarah
Beeson, recently honored with one of the I I
spots on the CTH Academic All-District VIII
team, is not far behind with an average of
.341.
Saturday's doubleheader against f'ac-lO
powerhouse Arizona State will be an even
more dramatic scramble as the two squads are
currently neck-to-neck in conference stand
ings. The Stanford women are anxious to
avenge the 4-3 defeat they suffered against
the Sun-Devils earlier in the season.
"These three games are really big, espe

cially Saturday's games. Aim splitting with
Arizona early on, this gives us a great oppor
tunity to gain momentum before regionals,"
said freslunan pitcher Dana Sorensen.
I lie Stanford squad has grown accus
tomed to such intensity, as 14 of its I<S con
ference match-lips this season have been de
cided by two runs or fewer.
"In die Pac-lOall the games are going to be
c lose, and we are learning how to win those
tight match-ups," Rittman said. "Our team
has fought through this year, managed to im
prove throughout and right now we are play

ing the best s< >ftl>a 11 \\c have all season. I hat is
essentially what even' team wants to do at the
end."
"()ur biggest priorit\ is that we are on our
game when we get to regionals. and hopeful
ly this weekend we can build some momen
tum," Rittman said.
Friday's match against Arizona starts at 2
p.m. with a senior ceremony prior to play.
I he ceremony will honor Lauren Gelhnan
and catcher Kellie Wiginton, who has started
every game behind the plate since she
stepped on the diamond as a freshman.
