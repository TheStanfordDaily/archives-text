### BEN ALLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
With just one week remaining
before the Pacific 10 Conference
track and field championships in
Eugene, Ore., Stanford will divide
its men one final time for competi
tions this weekend.
Tonight's Cardinal Qualifier
here on the Farm will see the dis
tance ranks go for top marks in an
other high-caliber meet, while
sprinters, jumpers and a thrower
or two will compete in Saturday's
Modesto Relays.
While head coach Vin Lananna
contends that the Qualifier will be
a lower-key meet than the Cardi
nal Invitational one week ago, his
aims for the meet are three-fold.
"The Qualifier will be a c ulmi
nating meet for some athletes,"
Lananna said. "Secondly, if we
need any tune-ups before Pac-lOs,
those athletes will compete. The
third purpose is if we need a qual
ifier for something."
That "something" could be any
thing from the Pac-10 meet to the
NCAAs or even the Olympic Tri
als, depending upon the athlete
and the event.
I he Qualifier will once again be
distance-race oriented, with the
strongest fields represented in the
800- and 1,500-meter runs.
Pacesetters will dictate the tem
pos of those races â€” 3 minutes,
38.0 seconds is the goal in the

1,500, and 1:4(i.O is the target in
t he 800.
Redshirt sophomore Cabe Jen
nings, who blazed to a 3:37.33 vic
tory in the 1,300 last week, is likely
to seek an Olympic and NCAA
qualifier in the 800along with red
shirt junior Michael Stember.
Jennings is also entered in the
1,500 along with redshirt sopho
more Jonathon Riley and fresh
man Andy Powell.
Seniors Brad and Brent I lauser
will also make a rare appearance in
the 1,500 as a mid-season time tip.
The 5,000-meter run is also set
to lly, with Ryan Wilson of Adidas
and Asics' Ruben Reina leading
the charge.
Stanford will send sophomores
Daniel Parris and Joe Urbanski
into the fray along with senior
Mike Devine.
Running events begin at 7 p.m.
with the 100 meters at Cobb
Track.
Saturday's Modesto Relays will
give be a time-up opportunity for
the Cardinal's sprinters and
jumpers as well.
Senior Toby Stevenson will join
the crew to compete in the pole
vault, and freshman Oiner I nan
will participate in the throws.
The multi-event section of the
Pac-10 meet will also begin this
weekend. However, Stanford's
lone contender in the decathlon,
freshman Jay Cofl, will not com
pete due to soreness in his back.
