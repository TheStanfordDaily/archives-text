1 he regular season is over. The records have
been thrown out the window. Sixty-four teams
around the nation are prepared to battle for the
ultimate prize, the NCAA championship.
Yes, it's time for May Madness, and the No.
1 Stanford men's tennis team (22-1) has an ex
cellent chance to walk away with its fifth NCA\
title in the past six years.
Tournament play for the top-seeded Cardi
nal begins tomorrow as Stanford hosts No. 49-
64 seed Northwestern (11-11) at noon at the
I aube Family lennis Stadium. Earlier in the
day, No. 33-49 seed California (12-10) will take
on No. 17-32 seed Auburn (14-9) in another
first-round match.
The winner of both matches will battle Sun
day at noon in the second round lor a chance to
go to Athens, Ca., for the final four rounds of
the tournament from May 20-23.
Stanford, one ol 10 schools hosting first- and
second-round matches, is clearly the favorite to
walk out oi die 1 aube Family l ennis Stadium
as the victor.
"We're favored to get out of our region," said
head coach Dick Could. "However, being fa

I he Cardinal enters the NCAA Tournament

with a 13-1 record against schools in the 64-
team field, including two wins over second
seeded UCLA.
The team comes into the postseason with not
only the No. 1 doubles team in the nation, se
nior Ceoff Abrams and junior Alex Kim, but
also three of the top 11 singles players in the
country: No. 5 Abrams, No. 7 Kim and No. 11
K.J. Hippensteel, a sophomore
Because of their excellent performance this
season, Kim and Abrams were named the co-
Pacific 10 Conference players of the year earli
er this week.
Playing in the No. 1 spot during the majori
ty ofseason, Kim has led the Cardinal through
out the year. He has also won singles titles at the
I FA Regionals and National Collegiate l ennis
Classic.
Abrams is coming off an amazing perfor
mance at the Pac-10 Individual Champi
onships two weeks ago. In the finals of the
tournament, Abrams outlasted Kim, 7-6,6-7,6-
4, to capture the title. With the victory, Abrams
has won an astounding 22 straight matches. I le
has not lost in singles since he dropped a three
setter to Jeff Laski of Illinois on Feb. 24 at the
National Team Indoor Championships.
Abrams, Kim and the rest of the Cardinal
team will need to keep up their outstanding
level of play if they want to fair well in the NCAA
tournament.
However, in the team's first-round match,

Northwestern should not pose a major threat to
the Cardinal. Two weeks ago, the Wildcats ad
vanced to the semifinals of the Big 10 Tourna
ment before falling to No. 18 Minnesota, 4-1.
"Northwestern is a .500 team, but we haven't
played in a few weeks," Gould said. "We're
coming off a loss in our last match [against No.
2 UCLA]. So hopefully we can start a winning
streak and get back on track."
Before losing their final dual match of the sea
son, 5-2, at UCLA, the Cardinal had won an im
pressive 22 matches straight. To win the NCAA
title, the team will only need to win six straight
matches, but the competition will be very tough.
Stanford's potential second-round match
with either Cal or Auburn should be more chal
lenging.
Cal, led by the No. 22 doubles team of Erik
Dmytruk and Scott Kintz, suffered five of its 10
losses against teams ranked among the top 10
nationally. The Cardinal has already defeated
Cal twice earlier this year, 5-2 at Berkeley and
6-1 at home.
Auburn, which is ranked 'Ust in the nation,
has three players ranked among the top 100 na
tionally: No. 35 Stephen 1 luss, No. 75 Georges
Matijasevic and No. 89Tiago Rutfoni.
"Both Auburn and Cal are good teams,"
Gould said. "I expect them to play a great
match, l he winner of that match will definitely
be a worthy competitor for the winner of [the
Northwestern-Stanford] match."
