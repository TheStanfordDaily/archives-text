# Women take confidence into tournament
## 
### BILL HANSON STAFF WRITER 
The perfect season.
For most teams, it's merely a dream.
For the Stanford women's tennis team, it's a
realistic possibility.
The top-ranked Cardinal (25-0, 9-0 Pacific
1 0 (lonference) has yet to lose a dual match this
season and has already secured the Pac-10
team title.
Over the next two weeks, the Cardinal will
see il ii can take its success even further. Today
at the Taube Family Tennis Stadium, Stanford
takes on Weber State (13-7) in the first round of
the NCAA Team Championships.
If the Cardinal gets past Weber State, it will
play either (Hemson or Fresno State in the sec
ond round on Saturday. A victory on Saturday
would send the squad to Malibu, Calif., to com
pete in the final rounds of the tournament.
Stanford's draw is a fairly smooth one. In the
quarterfinals, the Cardinal could face eighth
ranked UCLA, while fifth-ranked California
looms as a possible semifinal round opponent.
Both second-ranked Florida and third-ranked
Georgia are in the opposite half of the draw.
Stanford head coach Frank Brennan, however,
doesn't want to think too far ahead.
"This weekend is going to be tough," he said.
"Both Clemson and Fresno State are very good
teams, so it's going to be a competitive second
round match."
Nonetheless, Brennan seems confident of
his team's title chances.
"This is a team that is comfortable being No.
1," he said. "Some people would rather be No.
4 and then sneak up on people. But these girls
seem comfortable at the top. My job is just to
keep them focused and encourage them to not
take any of their opponents lightly. We would
like to defend our national title."
Last year, a young and inexperienced Car
dinal squad composed of four freshmen and
two upperclassmen toppled Florida to win the
national title. This year, those freshmen have
matured into seasoned collegiate competitors.
Sophomore Marissa Irvin, who last season
reached the final of the NCAA Individual
Championships, has improved since her preco
cious collegiate debut.
Over the past few months, Irvin has partici
pated in several professional tournaments,

compiling an
impressive 17-3
record and at
taining a world
ranking of 80th.
At the same
time, Irvin has
managed to
compile an un
blemished 19-0
record while
playing No. 1
singles for the
Cardinal. Irvin
is currently
ranked No. 1 in
the national col
legiate rank
ings.
"I I eel like
she's the best
player in college
tennis," Bren
nan said. "After
this season, it's
probably time
for her to move
on to the profes
sional ranks.
She's been great,
though. She's
been a real star
for us."

Sophomore
Lauren Kalvaria has also bios med this season,
compiling a team-leading 34-7 singles record.
Maintaining the momentum of a stellar presea
son. she reached the semifinals of both the I FA
National Indoor Championships and the Pac
-10 Individual Championships. She is currently
ranked ninth in the nation.
Freshman Laura Granville has also been an
invaluable asset to the Cardinal squad, compil
ing a 33-3 singles record and achieving a na
tional ranking of No. 3.
Stanford's success, however, isn't attribut
able to two or three dominant players. The Car
dinal boasts one of the deepest lineups in colle
giate tennis history.
Sophomore Keiko Tokuda, for example, is
ranked 32nd in the national collegiate rank
ings yet ranks seventh on the Cardinal singles
ladder.

"We're very proud of Keiko for a variety of
reasons," Brennan said. "To be a starter last
year and not starting this year is a difficult posi
tion to be in. But she is so important to our
team. She is 11-0 in dual match play and has
had some great results in individual tourna
ments, beating several highly-ranked oppo
nents."
Tokuda, along with Irvin, Kalvaria,
Granville, and senior Teryn Ashley, has already
earned a spot among the elite 32-player field of
the NCAA Individual Championships, which
take place at Malibu the week proceeding the
ream Championships.
"We were happy to get that many players in
the draw," Brennan said. "But before we look
at the Individuals, we have to locus on the
Team Championships. The Team Champi
onships are definitely the priority."
