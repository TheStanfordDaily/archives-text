theSo(iel\ tin Women Engineers.
I lie pin pose of 11i i>> event is to target kids
t'roin pool (oinniunities in the surrounding
area and give tlicin a da\ ol lun with science,'
said Maggie Montgomery, .1 junior majoring in
i ivil and em iron mental engineering who is one
ol the coordinators 101 1 his year's event.
I he children, lout ill- and tilth-graders from
lo( ;il elemental \ book, w ill attend workshops

petition.
I liese competitions are lun and creative.
I asi \ ear, it was building a tower ol cards to see

" I lie one worry I have now is if it w ill rain or
not on Saturday. Otherwise I'm really looking
forward to the whole event,'' said Klita (iheiing,
a senior majoring in industrial engineering
who is the other coordinator lor Exploring
New Worlds.
"I'm very excited about giving the kids a lun
and interactive exposure to basic engineering.
We want tliein to see how math and science isn't
just a bunch ol equations," agreed Mont
gomery.
Although the activity day brings together
both lourth-and filth-grade boys and girls from
San Francisco to San |ose, the focus will be
pla< ed on reaching out to minority girls.
" I his is an annual event held bv SWE and

nority (oinniunities," said ( lieiing.
Montgomery agreed, adding, "We want all
the kids 10 be excited and inspired by science,
especiallv because some California schools

don't even oiler science as a subject. Instead,
lhey need to foc us on teaching kids, whose sec -
ond language is Knglish, liovv to read and
write."
In lad, the event is successfully expanding,
and this year is bringing in twice as many kids
as last year.
