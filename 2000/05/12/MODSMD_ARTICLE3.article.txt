## 
### MARK BOUCHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
More than 35,000 Native Americans
from around the United States and
Canada are expec ted to gather at Stan
ford this weekend to celebrate their
culture and their heritage at the Stan
ford Powwow, which is thenied "Unit
ing Native Peoples for All Genera
tions." I lie powwow, now in its 29th
year, will feature a drum contest and a
dance contest with well-known contes
tants and cash prizes.
The attendance figure of over
35,000 people will make this year's cel

ebration one of the five largest in the
country and the country's largest uni
versity powwow, said Stanford alum
nus Vincent Fuentes, who has helped
to organize the pow wow in past years.
The powwow is especially large con
sidering that few Native American
reservations are located near Stanford,
noted Fuentes. Many Native Ameri
cans travel to the powwow from their
homes in the Bay Area and in the Los
Angeles metropolitan area.
'I'lie powwow was first held in 1971
to raise awareness about Native Ameri
can culture and to lobby the I Jniversity
to dispose of the Stanford Indian as its

mascot. A few hundred people attend
ed and crowded into ;i g\ mnasium oil
campus for die drum and dance con
tests.
1 his vear, it will he held in Kuc ah p
tus (irove, as it has been in recent years,
which is located across the street from
Stanford Stadium. Camping will he
available, with ass donatic>n recptested
for each camp site.
Fuentes said that moving the pow
wow outside greatly increased the at
tendance because the capacity is so
much greater.

Raul Valerio prepares his grandson, Anthony Gibson, for a grass dance competition at the De Anza College Powwow last week
end, while family friend Ryan Bill looks on. Gibson is from the Apache, Navajo and Cherokee tribes.
Although the attendance has
grown, Fuentes added, many as
pects of the powwow, such as
iundraising, the level of student
involvement and the competi
tions, have not changed since the
first powwow.
Funding for the event has al
ways come primarily from
lundraising and alumni contribu
tions.
Funds from the ASS U and from
selling powwowt-shirts have also
provided revenue for the powwow
in recent years.
Students have always coordi
nated and organized the pow
wow. According to Fuentes, many
of the students in the Stanford
American Indian Organization
are involved in some way in help
ing with the event. They rotate
the positions among themselves
each year.
"It's amazing how many things
20 people can do," Fuentes said.
I lie powwow's main events, the
drum competition and the dance
competition, have changed little
since its inception. I his year, sev
eral Native American drum
groups will compete in the drum
< oiliest for prizes of up to $2,500.
The contest is separated into three
styles of drumming, the Northern
Drum Contest, the Southern
Drum Contest and the Hand
Drum, each of which will choose a

winner.
The dance competition fea
tures brackets tor four different
styles of dancing for adults.
Teenagers and children can also
participate in competitions for
their age groups. Frizes are as high
as $600 for the winners.
Attendees are also invited to
participate in the Fun Run, a five
kilometer race which will start ai
8:!i() a.m. Saturday at the Angell
Track and Field complex.
Winners will be awarded
unique Indian awards, sweatshirts
and handmade medallions.
Fuentes said that the competi
tions have become more intense
in recent years as the powwow s
reputation has improved and
more "high-name' dance groups
and drum groups have competed.
1 lie powwow slaris with the
(.rand Fntry, in which the head
staff of the powwow and the
dancers enter the circle of the
drummers to be honored.
Another powwow tradition is
"honor dances," which are dances
held to honor specific groups,
such as the celebration's organiz
ers or tribal elders.
Fuentes said that many famous
Native Americans have attended
the powwow in the past.
Two well-known attendees
were activist Russell Means and
ac lor Floyd Rede row Westerinan,
who played a Native American
c hief in the movie "Dances Willi
Wolves."
"We encourage everybody fat
Stanford] to attend," said Fuentes.
