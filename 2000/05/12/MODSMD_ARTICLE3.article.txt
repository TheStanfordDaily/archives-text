### MARK BOUCHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
More than 35,000 Native Americans
from around the United States and
Canada are expec ted to gather at Stan
ford this weekend to celebrate their
culture and their heritage at the Stan
ford Powwow, which is thenied "Unit
ing Native Peoples for All Genera
tions." I lie powwow, now in its 29th
year, will feature a drum contest and a
dance contest with well-known contes
tants and cash prizes.
The attendance figure of over
35,000 people will make this year's cel

ebration one of the five largest in the
country and the country's largest uni
versity powwow, said Stanford alum
nus Vincent Fuentes, who has helped
to organize the pow wow in past years.
The powwow is especially large con
sidering that few Native American
reservations are located near Stanford,
noted Fuentes. Many Native Ameri
cans travel to the powwow from their
homes in the Bay Area and in the Los
Angeles metropolitan area.
'I'lie powwow was first held in 1971
to raise awareness about Native Ameri
can culture and to lobby the I Jniversity
to dispose of the Stanford Indian as its

mascot. A few hundred people attend
ed and crowded into ;i g\ mnasium oil
campus for die drum and dance con
tests.
1 his vear, it will he held in Kuc ah p
tus (irove, as it has been in recent years,
which is located across the street from
Stanford Stadium. Camping will he
available, with ass donatic>n recptested
for each camp site.
Fuentes said that moving the pow
wow outside greatly increased the at
tendance because the capacity is so
much greater.
