Does an Internet connection cause a
social disconnection? A new study re
leased Wednesday by the Few Internet
and American Life Project challenges a
recent study by Stanford's Institute for
the Quantitative Study of Society which
found that the Internet could increase
isolation.
Of the 3,533 adults surveyed by Pew,
72 percent of Internet users had visited
either a friend or a relative the previous

day. Only f>l percent of non-users
could say the s;imc.
Pew says in their report that, "As a
group, Internet users are more likely
than nonusers to have a robust social
world."
Internet users appear to have ;i larg
er support network than non-users.
Forty-eight percent of users say they
have many people to turn to iu a time of
need, whereas only 38 percent of non
users report they have such resources.
E-mail is a particularly valuable re
source for increased communication

between friends and lamih. Because
the Internet is available 21 hours a da\.
people can keep in touch despite ilteii
busy lifestyles and different time /ones.
Ninety percent of users said e-mail has
facilitated communication with family,
and percent said the same about
their friends.
Not everyone, however, agrees tli.it
the Internet is a social enhancer. Ihe
