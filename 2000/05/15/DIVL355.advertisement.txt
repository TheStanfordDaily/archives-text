A Fatigue is the seventh most
common complaint that
primary care physicians hear
(your parents and friends may
hear it more often). When
you're tired, you don't think as
fast or as accurately, you may
misjudge things, and your skill
level decreases. You may be
unable to start normal acti
vities, or to finish them. Fatigue
falls into different categories:
Sleep Debt: You are likely to
feel tired if you don't get the
right foods, or enough exer
cise, or sleep. Millions of
Americans simply don't get
enough sleep. But getting the
amount of sleep your body
requires is not a luxury, it is
mandatory. If you stay up too
late, you go into sleep debt.
Sleep can't be stored up, and
the debt won't go away by
itself. It can only be paid off
with extra hours later, so
you're borrowing on the next
night's sleep.
Psychological: This kind of
fatigue is caused by emotional
problems or conflicts. Anxiety
and/or depression is the most
common cause of prolonged
fatigue.
Medical: Fatigue may be a side
effect of an underlying physical
condition (e.g. flu or other infec
tions; anemia; low thyroid;
pregnancy; alcohol, caffeine, or
other stimulant overuse), but it
During World War 11, this
Stanford student dozed off at
the library. Easy to do.
is usually accompanied by other
symptoms.
Medical note: Mono almost
always has additional symptoms.
Your Sleep Needs
There is no right amount of
sleep for everyone. You may
need anywhere from between
six and ten hours a night
("eight hours" is just one of
those "averages"). Tune in to
your own biological clock. If
you need 6 hours, that's it. If
you need 10, get them. Main
tain a regular pattern of
sleeping during the same hours
each night.
For More Energy
Food: You're likely to feel tired
if you skip meals or eat too
little. Eat balanced meals
regularly.
Exercise: This increases energy,
and it also releases tension,
keeps you in shape, and
enabler you to sleep better. Get
a minimum of 30 minutes three
times a week.
Take Breaks: Re-energize
yourself often: stretch, walk,
change your pace or scene, get
some fresh air, grab a quick
nap, and use relaxation tech
niques. Also:
■ Identify your "high" and
"low" periods, and match
activities to those times as
best you can
■ Fatigue impairs judgment,
slows reaction time, and
dulls awareness, so don't
drive or operate that crane
when you're tired
■ For muscle fatigue, try
gentle stretching or a
relaxing bath (if no tub take
a hot shower)
■ Carry a snack with you at all
times (graham crackers,
orange juice, dried fruit, an
apple)
■ Caffeine or sleeping pills
rarely help with fatigue, and
they may be counter
productive
■ Expect to feel tired fora
week or so after an illness
(give your body time to
recover; pushing can cause
relapse)
■ Stay tuned in to your body
for stress indicators (e.g.,
headache, backache, grouch
iness, fatigue); counteract
them with rest and relax
ation
If fatigue doesn't go away with
sleep, consider getting a
medical and/or psychological
evaluation. Q
