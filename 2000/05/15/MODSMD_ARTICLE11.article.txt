1961
A May 15 issue of The Stanford Daily
reported on the University s suspension ol
then-Stanford Chapparal editor Brad
Efron, who is now a professor of Statistics
at Stanford.
"Accusations of religious pressure and
official denials added yesterday to campus
furor over Friday's suspension by Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler of the
Chapparal and its editor Brad Efron for
the rest of tfie academic year . . .
The particular article under fire was the
one entitled "The Ass and the Cuckold."
University sources label the article "a
burlesque of the Incarnation, the Virgin
Birth ..."
The Bottom Line: Infuriating the administration
today might get you tenure tomorrow.
