## Mothers rally for strict gun control in Washington, D.C. 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Tens
of thousands of mothers, many
accompanied by children and
husbands, rallied in sight of the
Capitol yesterday to demand strict
control ot handguns while memo
rializing loved ones and strangers
felled by bullets.
Through personal stories of
tragedy, songs, banners, posters,
T-shirts and tears, participants in
the"Million Mom March" aimed
to send Congress a "Mother's
Day" message: A new movement
of mainstream Americans is get
ting politically active, ready to bat
tle the gun lobby and to work
against lawmakers who oppose
gun control.
"Politicians, take heed. We are
watching you. The hands that
rock the cradles rule the world,"
said Dawn Anna, mother of Lau
ren Townsend, a student killed in
the Columbine High School
shootings that stunned the nation
last year.
Huge crowds thronged to the
National Mall, the blocks-long
grass and sand terrain that has
been host to many Washington
demonstrations, under a brilliant
spring sun. Though there were
no official crowd estimates, partic
ipants filled half a dozen blocks on
the mall framed by the museums
of the Smithsonian Institution,
Congress and the Washington
Monument. Similar rallies were
scheduled in nearly 70 cities
across the country.

"We are Columbine,"
exclaimed a banner carried by
Coloradans who traveled here in
remembrance of Columbine.
The gun-control advocates
didn't have the day to themselves,
however. A considerably smaller
group of several thousand
counter-demonstrators gathered
near the Washington Monument
to hold a rally where they argued
that guns were needed for self
protection.
That demonstration, organized
by a group called Second Amend
ment Sisters, Inc., also included
mothers who brought their chil
dren. The group booed President
Clinton's motorcade as it hap
pened to pass by, returning the
president to the White House
from church.
"My kids know, if you see a
gun, you don't touch it. You leave
the area, you go tell a responsible
adult," said Elitza Meyer, from
Watchung, N.J.
When opponents of gun con
trol marched toward the Capitol,
they came close to "Million Mom
March" participants, who jeered
and chanted "No NRA, No NRA.
Your stupid guns kill."
In response, members of the
pro-gun group yelled, "Second
Amendment, civil rights. You
give up your guns, we'll give up
ours."
Clinton remained at the
White House, encouraging sev
eral hundred rally figures to sur

mount "the political mountain"
they had to climb. First lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton, run
ning fora U.S. Senate seat from
New York, joined the demon
stration. Neither she nor the
president appeared on the dais,
although their messages carried
on jumbo television screens.
Mrs. Clinton did join the
march fora time, but the crush of
onlookers forced her to a nearby
road where she slowly made her
way to the Capitol on her own,
shaking hands with well-wishers
who lined the streets.
Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy
Townsend, a Maryland Democrat
and a daughter of the slain Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy, said: "You
know, Mothers Against Drunk
Driving had an enormous impact
against traffic deaths and I think
we can have the same impact
here."
But for the most part, elected
officials stood in the back
ground; the day was reserved
instead for supportive entertain
ers, including mistress of cere
monies Rosie O'Donnell, a televi
sion talk show host, and for
women who told painful, per
sonal stories of losing loved ones
to gun violence.
"The gun that killed my
daughter in her classroom was
one that could be loaded by a ()-
year-old, carried by a 6-year-old,
and tired by a 6-year-old," said
Veronica McQueen, who was

transformed into a public figure
when her daughter, Kayla Rol
land, was shot and killed in her
first grade classroom in Flint,
Mich., last Feb. 29.
For the gun-control rally,
thousands of Mother's Day cards
were printed with the message:
"Forget the flowers . . . forget

the chocolate forget breakfast in
bed. This Mother's Day, give us a
present that lasts: common sense
gun laws."
Charles Payne, of Wood
bridge, Va., said he was a com
petitive shooter and life member
of the National Rifle Association
but still supported the rally.

"1 don't like Handgun Con
trol Incorporated and I don't
like the hard line of the NRA,"
he said. "People misuse guns and
give my guns a bad name. What
1 resent is handguns in the
hands of unsupervised kids, and
parents who don't take time to
control their own weapons."
