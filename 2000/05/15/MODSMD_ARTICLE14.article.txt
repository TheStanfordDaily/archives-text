# friends' cast back for two more years

### 
NEW YORK (AP) — NBC will keep its
"Friends" for two more years, but the six
actors who star in the sitcom will be getting
a lot more money to hang around the coffee
shop.
After negotiations with Warner Brothers
Television that ended in the predawn hours
yesterday, the actors agreed to return for
$20 million per year each, according to exec
utives close to the talks who requested
anonymity.
Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox Arquette,
Lisa Kudrow, Matt Leßlanc, Matthew Perry
and David Schwimmer will be getting a big
raise from the reported $125,000 they made
112 or each of the 22 episodes this season.
The deal came a day before NBC was to
present its fiill schedule to advertisers in New
York. The network had imposed a deadline of
3 p.m. EOT yesterday to get an agreement, or

it was prepared to announce a schedule with
out "Friends" in its customary slot on Thurs
days at 8 p.m.
Losing "Friends" would have been a major
blow to NBC, which has had trouble develop
ing new comedies and has seen its Thursday
dominance somewhat eroded by ABC's "Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire."
Instead, negotiators beat the deadline by
about 12 hours. The actors reached the deal
with Warner Bros., the studio that produces
the show.
Fhe six "Friends" will be paid $750,000 per
episode lor each year. They were also given a
greater percentage of the profits from the sit
com's lucrative syndication deals, giving them
each a total of $40 million over two years,
executives said yesterday. The stars had
reportedly been demanding $1 million each
per episode to return — a sum NBC paid

Helen Hunt and Paul Reiser for the final year
of "Mad About You."
'"Friends' is one of the best written, pro
duced and directed shows on television. We
are thrilled and excited to continue," the
actors said in a joint statement.
The show finishes its sixth season with a
one-hour special this 1 hursday.
"We're thrilled to have our No. I sitcom on
Thursday nights again in September," said
NBC spokeswoman Shirley Powell.
Most people in television expected the deal
to get done at the last minute. NBC] could ill
afford to lose one of iis most popular shows,
and the actors — while agreeing to an all-for
one, one-for-all negotiating strategy — hadn't
expressed any great desire to leave.
Another off-air cliflhanger will he resolved
later this week. Fox is still uncertain whether
"The X-Files" will return for another season.
