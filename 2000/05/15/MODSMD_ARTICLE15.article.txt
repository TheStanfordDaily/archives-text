# Residents of Los Alamos view fire damage

### 
LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) —
Made refugees by fire, hundreds
(H evacuated residents of Los
Alamos solemnly returned yester
day in convoys of yellow school
lAises to the scared homes, black
ened yards and still-smoking vis
tas of their abandoned town.
Moments of loss and joy
marked Mother's Day for the
region's weary residents. Families
without homes came together in
Red Cross shelters to mark the
holiday, while churchgoers
mourned their own losses but
expressed relief that nobody was
hurt. In a sign of life returning to
normal, the 7,000 people of near
by White Rock, which wasn't
burned, were allowed to go home.
The most poignant scenes,
though, came in Los Alamos,
where the buses arrived from
Santa Fe throughout the day.
I'hey carried counselors, clergy
and 360 residents up winding
roads to the mountain community
of 1 1,000 that was suddenly emp
tied of life four days earlier.
But the trip home was incom
plete. Access was limited, and
most were forced to see the dam
age from behind windows as the
buses slowly moved through
tow n. The handful who did get off
the bus photographed or video
taped the damage, but were told
not to get too close.
Only residents whose homes

were destroyed were allowed back
into Los Alamos. Burned-out cars
sat near scorched trees in neigh
borhoods now painted in shades
of gray. In one lot, a solitary,
charred brick staircase climbed a
story high. Nearby stood a pair of
apparently untouched wood bird
feeders, one with seed still in it.

Some cried, and others sat in
stony silence, seemingly stunned
by the extent of the destruction,
said Jack Downing, a Red Cross
psychologist who traveled on one
of the buses.
Judy Opsahl, a 64-year-old
Red Cross volunteer whose home
was still smoldering, said she was

more worried about her neigh
bors than about her own loss.
"We're already starting to think
about rebuilding," she said.
I he residents ol White Rock
were allowed to return to their
homes three clays alter they were
evacuated in the middle of the
night.
