JERL'SALEM (AP) — Fins
nation over stalled negotiations
exploded into violence yester
day as thousands of Palestinian
protesters clashed with Israeli
troops — demonstrations that
left one Palestinian dead and
about 38 people injured.
In the Gaza Strip, more than
500 Palestinians charged an
Israeli army base near the Jew
ish settlement of Netzarim,
hurling stones and Molotov
cocktails over the fence. Pales
tinian police halfheartedly
chased away some of the
demonstrators, and Israeli
troops fired rubber-coated steel
pellets, injuring at least nine
people.
Similar clashes involving
thousands of Palestinians took
place in the West Bank cities of
Nablus and Ramallah, injuring
I 1 Palestinians, an army officer
and a border policeman, none
seriously. Chose dashes began
as marches commemorated
today's 52nd anniversary of al-
Nakba or "the catastrophe" —
the term Palestinians use to
refer to Israel's creation, which
displaced hundreds of thou
sands of Palestinians.
Dr. Hussam Al-Jouhari of
Rafidiye hospital in Nablus said
five of the protesters were
injured by bullets. The Israeli
army would not immediately
comment.
Meanwhile, a meeting to dis
cuss the release of 1,600 Pales
tinians jailed for anti-Israeli
attacks ended in near deadlock,
with Israeli negotiator Oded
Kran demanding (hat Palestini
an police first quell the violence.
"No talks can produce posi
tive results while the violent
demonstrations continue," Kran
told reporters, but he said Israel
would still continue to negoti
ate.
Senior Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat, who has given
Israel a list of 200 prisoners he
wants freed, said he told Kran
that "the reason for these
demonstrations must be

Addressed*' Palestinian negotia
tor Qaddura Fares said the
protests would intensify.
In the northern West Bank
city of Qalqilya a young Pales
tinian was killed in a clash with
Israeli soldiers, a doctor said.
Samar Ahmad Awartani, 17,
was fatally hit by a bullet in the
chest, said the doctor at Qalqilya
hospital, speaking on condition
of anonymity. He added that
about 12 demonstrators were
injured by rubber-coated steel
pellets fired by soldiers.
In the Megiddo military
prison in northern Israel,
guards fired tear gas after pris
oners holding a rally refused to
disperse. I bt* army said the
prisoners threw objects at the
guards and burned their tents.
One guard and two prison
ers were slightly injured, the
army said.
Almost every Palestinian
family has a male relative who
spent some time in Israeli jails,
and many Palestinian ministers
and lawmakers are former pris
oners. Israel has released hun
dreds of prisoners as part of
detailed peace accords but sa\s
it will not release Palestinians
jailed for killing Israelis.
Fhe third day of violence
comes as Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators are having trouble
reaching agreement on the
thorniest issues of the conflict
between the sides: the future of
Jerusalem, claimed by both
sides as their capital, the fate of
Palestinian refugees and of Jew
ish settlements in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, and final
borders of a Palestinian state.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's office said in a state
ment that while il did not accuse
the Palestinian Authority of
instigating "the violent winds"
sweeping across the Palestinian
areas, it expected Palestinian
police to prevent the escalation.
Ihe statement said that Israel
had already fulfilled its obliga
tion to release prisoners as part
of interim peace accords.
