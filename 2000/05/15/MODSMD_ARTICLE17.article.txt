## The 						Stanford Daily Questioning revamped Sophomore College policies 
### 
Pubtithed Since ix l >l

While Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education John Brav
man's recent decision to cap the
growth of Sophomore College
by fixing the faculty-student ratio at 12 stu
dents per professor is commendable in light
of receni complaints that the quality of the
Sophomore College experience has declined
because the number of participating students
has increased. I lowever, his decision not to
expand the number of classes in the future at
all seems unfortunate.
This year, the college will offer only 27
classes as opposed to last year's .'56, but the
number of participating sophomores will
remain the same as the faculty-student ratio

increases from one to 10 to one to 12. No for
mal decision was made to decrease the
amount of classes offered, rather, an error in
estimating the number of faculty who would
be available and willing to teach this summer
occured.
Yet this error seems to be a blessing in dis
guise compared to last year when more pro
fessors expressed interest in the college than
were expected. When so many new faculty
were taken on, the college seemed to lose
some of its traditions and sense of specialness.
It seems important for Sophomore College to
adjust to growing demand without neutraliz
ing the effectiveness of its classes and what
students gain from them.

The college should thus not look to per
manently cap the number of classes it offers
but instead to better train faculty participat
ing in the program so that participating stu
dents feel like they gain something unique
out of it. In addition, class size, like Bravman
said, should not expand beyond 14 students
per professor. Like freshman Zachary Halde
man, a Sophomore college applicant, said of
class size, "Any smaller and discussions slow
down; any bigger and you have people com
peting for attention and you become anony
mous."
To avoid repeating what for some current
sophomores was only a mediocre Sophomore
College experience, in the future the college

should not look to expand as rapidly as it did
between 1998 and 1999. The program
should also continue take into consideration
participation in the program as well as repu
tation as undergraduate teachers in close set
tings before extending invitations to faculty
to participate in Sophomore College.
It is unfortunate that once students go
through the process of gaining admission to
Stanford that they must go through another
application process to gain admission to spe
cial programs such as Sophomore College
and Freshman / Sophomore Seminars. But as
long as this internal application process must
continue, its rewards should remain worth
while.
