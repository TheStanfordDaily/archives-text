# WHAT THE HECK I'M TALKING ABOUT
## Stanford sprezzatura 
### 
Everything I need to know
about Stanford, I learned in
my Renaissance Literature
class. Do you find it hard to
believe that a Kith century best-seller
could still be relevant today?
I lien allow me to introduce you to
Baldesar Castiglione, the late (very
late) author of "The Book of the
Courtier." His book, which outlines
the qualities of the complete and per-

leet courtier, appar
ently sal in the back
pocket of every
respectable courtly
gentleman (or at least
in a back pocket
equivalent!) who was
hip to the groove of
the 1 fhSOs. And per
haps today it would
even achieve the
ranks of "Oprah's
Book (Hub."

I 'he hook is most famous for its def
inition of the courtier's universal rule
— .... to practice in all things a cer
tain spre/./.atuia' which conceals all
artistry and makes whatever one says
or does seem uncontrived and effort
less."
Sound familiar?
Let me refresh your memory. This
is the girl who's taking 22 units. She's
also playing on live IM teams, volun
teering at the Children's Hospital,
doubling as the social chair and finan
cial manager ol her house, and she's
starting her own company. She almost
always seems cheery, she never says
she's stressed out, and it seems like
she's at every social event.
Maybe you envy people like this.
(Maybe you hate them!) How do they
do it? They're so laid-back, and you
pull your hair out every night trying
to get things done. I've got a little
secret for you: it's not magic. You too
can possess spre/.zatura. These folks
are masters at maintaining an image
of that cool, collected, graceful success
that was key to being a top-notch
courtier back in Castiglione's day. And
it makes sense to want to emulate
them.
Often the leaders 1 most admire are
the ones that make it all look so easy.
Muhammad Ali was all about sprez
zatura. "Float like a butterfly, sting
like a bee." On the other hand, we
have the kid who stresses himself into
success — he bemoans his 72nd con
secutive waking hour, his heap of
impending problem sets and papers
and his nonstop schedule of meetings
without even a bathroom break. When

you ask him, "How are you," he gives
you a look of despair and replies,
"Stressed," "Busy" or "Aaaaah!"
There is something for this student to
learn from the calm appeal of sprez
zatura.
A lot of people seem to feel like get
ting worked up and stressed out about
everything they do is the only way to
motivate themselves to get it all done.
They repeat the mantra, I can't
believe how much work I have, I can't
believe how much work I
have . . . and create a cumulative,
hulking list of everything they have to
do, from homework and reading to
balancing their checkbook and taking
out the trash. Then they proceed to
freak out.
I read an article in Fast Company
magazine a while ago that made me
think ol the successful sprezzatura
practitioners. Here's what it pre
scribes to get things done, without
wearing yourself out.
First, take inventory of all the stuff
you haven't acted on. Then, find time
to clo things in the little windows —
the 15 minutes between lunch and
your next class. The half hour you
have between meetings in the after
noon. They don't need to be the most
important tasks — it could just be bal
ancing your checkbook or making
your bed. Just something to make you
a little more sane.
I hen, set priorities. David Allen,
the article's author, set it up like a
runway. At 10,000 feet are projects. At
20,000 feet are roles and goals. At
30,000 feet you're thinking about
your summer or next year. At 40,000
you're thinking post-grad (adjust
number if you're a graduating senior,
of course!). At the top, you're think
ing, as Allen puts it, "What's my job on
this planet?" Whoa.
Sounds scary, but it can help you
prioritize by cutting out some of the
activities that won t help you acheive
your long run goals. How much is that
A instead of A- really worth to you? Or
that last set of rotations when you
work out? Are they worth missing
lunch with a friend or missing your
favorite author's speech at Kresge?
There are infinite possibilites to
things we could do, but we have to set
boundaries on what we realistically
can do. Then the next step is, don't
waste energy worrying or complaining
about it. Do it, and do it well. A little
sprezzatura goes a long way.
