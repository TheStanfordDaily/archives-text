# Sidhwa discusses Indian partition
## Pakistani author draws large crowd for reading, offers female perspective 
### KATHERINE LEMONS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Pakistani writer Bapsi Sidhwa
described the lasting effects of the
partition of India as she read from
her novel "Cracking India" in An
nenberg Auditorium Friday
evening.
Assuming the voice of Lenny,
the eight-year-old narrator of her
novel, Sidhwa read to the audi
ence a passage from the novel de
scribing the impending partition,
which took place in 1947.
"There is much disturbing talk.
India is going to be broken. Can
one break a country? It is sudden.
One day everybody is themselves -
and the next day they are Hindu,
Muslim, Sikh, Christian. People
shrink, dwindling into symbols,"
Sidhwa read.
She also read from her most re
cently published novel, "American
Brat," an exploration of the expe
rience of a young Pakistani immi
grant to the United States.
About 300 people attended the
three-hour event, which included
readings by Sidhwa and a screen
ing of "Earth," a film adaptation of
"Cracking India" that evoked a
powerful response from the audi
ence as they questioned Sidhwa
about the historical accuracy of the
film.
Upon gaining independence
from British rule, India was divid
ed into two countries, Pakistan,
which was to be a Muslim state,
and India, predominantly Hindu,
but meant to be a secular state.
The term "partition" refers to this
split.
Sidhwa told the primarily
South Asian audience that there
has been very little written about
partition considering its impor
tance in South Asian history.
She told the audience that she
writes from a unique perspective.
"As a Parsi writer I am always a lit
tle on the margins. In India, I am

a Pakistani writer, in Pakistan I am
a Parsi writer," Sidhwa said.
The Parsis are one of India's
many minorities. They are descen
dants of Zoroastrians, who fled
Muslim persecution in Persia in
the eighth century and found
refuge in the state of Gujrat. Dur
ing the bloodshed and communal
violence of partition, they were
able to remain neutral because of
their distinct background.
Sidhwa, a native of Lahore in
present-day Pakistan, was seven at
the time of partition and she said
that "writing through the eyes of a
child, I felt myself shedding the
prejudice I have been taught
throughout my life."
Sidhwa said her purpose in
writing "Cracking India" was "to
write about what happened to
women during the partition."
She agreed to allow Indian lil
maker Deepa Mehta to direct a
film adaptation of the book be
cause Mehta "seemed to under
stand why the book is written from
the perspective of a Parsi child.
This narrator could bring a fair
ness to this very sensitive commu
nal issue."
"Earth" has been a controver
sial film in India. It follows the
novel closely in its depiction of par
tition through the eyes of its young
narrator as she comes of age
against a backdrop of increasing
social and political unrest and an
explosion of violence.
When an audience member
questioned Sidhwa about the accu
racy of the film's chronology of
events, she said that "no one owns
the truth. VVe did these things to
one another, our brothers and sis
ters. I here are no facts."
A member of the audience who
said he was a fourteen-year-old
resident of Delhi during partition
commented that "after 53 years
when I look back at [partition] 1
only see a tremendous human
tragedy. Such reflection gives rise
to everyone to search their con
science and their hearts."
Rafiq Dossani, a consulting pro
fessor for the Institute of Interna
tional Studies, welcomed theaudi
ence and introduced the main fi
nancial backer of the event,
Prakash Agarwal.
Agarwal, president of the
Agarwal Foundation, which pro

motes the culture and heritage of
India, lauded Sidhwa's talent be
fore visiting professor of Reli
gious Studies Linda Hess intro
duced Sidhwa.
The event was also sponsored
by the Stanford South Asia Initia
tive, the Department of Religious
Studies and the Stanford Center
for Buddhist Studies.
