Stanford alum criticizes Foothills plan
Stanford's decision to close the single
track dirt trails in the Stanford Foothills,
in the name of "conservation," puts me in
mind of advertising executive David
()gilvy's father, a crusty Scot who advised
his son, "Whenever a company or a
young woman boasts of virtue, avoid the
former and cultivate the latter."
For 100 years, the University has
allowed us to enjoy the incalculable bene
fits of walking and running in these beau
tiful hills. And for 100 years, we've
responded appropriately, treating access
to the Foothills as a privilege and leaving
little trace of our passage.
The Bay Area's hills are seamed with
literally thousands of miles of trails. In the
Marin Headlands, and on Mt. Tamalpais,
for example, hikers have used the hun
dreds of miles of single-track trail for over
a century, with pathetically small, if any,
detrimental effects on the environment.
Looking out over the Stanford Foothills,
too, it's obvious that trails occupy an
absurdly small portion of the landscape.
Stanford's own use of the Foothills, in
stark contrast, has been less than exem
plary. The annual months of leased cattle
grazing, the yearly bulldozing of miles of
firebreak, cause vastly more damage and
disfigurement than 100 years of hiking
have.
Stanford's motives are insultingly
transparent. By eliminating parking on
Stanford Avenue and by restricting hikers

to unpleasant pavement, they hope to
decrease the number of hikers so that
resistance to development will wane. The
care of the Stanford Foothills is best left in
the hands of those who love them, rather
than those who would merely use them.

Raising awareness on hunger
"The first freedom of man, I contend,
is the freedom to eat." This quote by
Eleanor R<x)sevelt illustrates one of the
biggest problems in the world today as
many individuals have limited access to
food. Estimates of those suffering from
hunger and malnutrition range from 1/6
to 1/2 of the world population.
A few weeks ago was the 16th Annual
Hunger Awareness Week, which is a
national week to recognize the problem
of hunger. Thousands of students across
the nation volunteered their time at local
soup kitchens and food pantries in order
to raise money for the hungry and home
less.
For all the Stanford students who vol
unteered their time, we applaud you.
And in recognition of this national event,
we would like to take a few minutes to dis
cuss the causes and consequences of
hunger and what we can do to assist in
the fight against hunger.
We live in the midst of all this affluence

and have nearly unlimited access to food,
that we often forget the plight of those
less fortunate than us. Every 3.6 seconds
someone dies of hunger, 3/4 of whom will
be under the age of five; the most vulner
able people to hunger are children. By
the time you finish reading this editorial,
35 people will have died from hunger
and malnutrition.
Hunger and malnutrition are so übiq
uitous that sheer numbers alone make it
one of humanity's significant concerns.
However, the problems become even
more significant since hunger and mal
nutrition causes severe social problems.
The connection between malnutrition,
non-education and child labor is quite
strong. For example, malnutrition harms
brain development at early ages (numer
ous studies have shown that brain devel
opment slows or even regresses as a result
of malnutrition) and causes poor perfor
mance in school (when a kid's stomach is
burning, it is difficult to concentrate).
This causes many parents in non-indus
trialized countries to pull their kids out of
school, and the kid becomes a child labor
er.
By fighting hunger, we can also help
in the fight against these international
social problems. Much of the root causes
of world hunger are structural. However,
there are things that we as students can
do to assist in the fight against hunger.
I he following are a few suggestions 1
have that anyone can do, but it is obvi
ously incomplete; feel free to e-mail me
with your suggestions:
1. Reduce your food waste in the din
ing halls; take only as much food as you
will eat since in most dining halls you can
go back. The amount of food thrown
away by students is enormous (just in Flo
rence Moore's dining hall fall quarter, the
food wastage by students was over 1,000
pounds weekly!), and collectively this has

disastrous effects. SPOON collects the
food that the dining halls don't serve and
gives it to a local charity in East Palo Alto,
so there are direct consequences of food
waste, including higher meal costs.
2. Make freedonation.com and (he
ll ungersite.com your homepage (and
your dorm computer cluster's homepage)
and click on them everyday. Sponsors pay
for food to be given to hungry families
from around the world. There are no
catches to these websites, and they are
legitimate. Fora family starving in an
underdeveloped country, this could
make all the difference. Please set them as

your homepage and tell all your friends
about it.
3. Educate yourself. (Jo to a search
engine and type in hunger. One of the
causes of hunger, 1 would argue, is the
relationship between First World and
Third World countries. As long as First
World countries' policies are neo-imperi
alistic (including tying Third World coun
tries into a never-ending cycle of debt),
then hunger and malnutrition will con
stantly be a problem for most of the
world. However, there are a plethora of
other causes, so please educate yourself
and e-mail me with any suggestions.

I hese are merely a few things one c an
do to assist in the light against hunger.
We thank all of those who participated in
the Kith Annual Hunger Awareness
Week, and we beg the Stanford commu
nity to help us iu the fight against hunger.
It is a dire situation, and we need all the
help we can gel.

responded appropriately, treating access
to the Foothills as a privilege and leaving
little trace of our passage.
The Bay Area's hills are seamed with
literally thousands of miles of trails. In the
Marin Headlands, and on Mt. Tamalpais,
for example, hikers have used the hun
dreds of miles of single-track trail for over
a century, with pathetically small, if any,
detrimental effects on the environment.
Looking out over the Stanford Foothills,
too, it's obvious that trails occupy an
absurdly small portion of the landscape.
Stanford's own use of the Foothills, in
stark contrast, has been less than exem
plary. The annual months of leased cattle
grazing, the yearly bulldozing of miles of
firebreak, cause vastly more damage and
disfigurement than 100 years of hiking
have.
Stanford's motives are insultingly
transparent. By eliminating parking on
Stanford Avenue and by restricting hikers

to unpleasant pavement, they hope to
decrease the number of hikers so that
resistance to development will wane. The
care of the Stanford Foothills is best left in
the hands of those who love them, rather
than those who would merely use them.

Raising awareness on hunger
"The first freedom of man, I contend,
is the freedom to eat." This quote by
Eleanor R<x)sevelt illustrates one of the
biggest problems in the world today as
many individuals have limited access to
food. Estimates of those suffering from
hunger and malnutrition range from 1/6
to 1/2 of the world population.
A few weeks ago was the 16th Annual
Hunger Awareness Week, which is a
national week to recognize the problem
of hunger. Thousands of students across
the nation volunteered their time at local
soup kitchens and food pantries in order
to raise money for the hungry and home
less.
For all the Stanford students who vol
unteered their time, we applaud you.
And in recognition of this national event,
we would like to take a few minutes to dis
cuss the causes and consequences of
hunger and what we can do to assist in
the fight against hunger.
We live in the midst of all this affluence

and have nearly unlimited access to food,
that we often forget the plight of those
less fortunate than us. Every 3.6 seconds
someone dies of hunger, 3/4 of whom will
be under the age of five; the most vulner
able people to hunger are children. By
the time you finish reading this editorial,
35 people will have died from hunger
and malnutrition.
Hunger and malnutrition are so übiq
uitous that sheer numbers alone make it
one of humanity's significant concerns.
However, the problems become even
more significant since hunger and mal
nutrition causes severe social problems.
The connection between malnutrition,
non-education and child labor is quite
strong. For example, malnutrition harms
brain development at early ages (numer
ous studies have shown that brain devel
opment slows or even regresses as a result
of malnutrition) and causes poor perfor
mance in school (when a kid's stomach is
burning, it is difficult to concentrate).
This causes many parents in non-indus
trialized countries to pull their kids out of
school, and the kid becomes a child labor
er.
By fighting hunger, we can also help
in the fight against these international
social problems. Much of the root causes
of world hunger are structural. However,
there are things that we as students can
do to assist in the fight against hunger.
I he following are a few suggestions 1
have that anyone can do, but it is obvi
ously incomplete; feel free to e-mail me
with your suggestions:
1. Reduce your food waste in the din
ing halls; take only as much food as you
will eat since in most dining halls you can
go back. The amount of food thrown
away by students is enormous (just in Flo
rence Moore's dining hall fall quarter, the
food wastage by students was over 1,000
pounds weekly!), and collectively this has

disastrous effects. SPOON collects the
food that the dining halls don't serve and
gives it to a local charity in East Palo Alto,
so there are direct consequences of food
waste, including higher meal costs.
2. Make freedonation.com and (he
ll ungersite.com your homepage (and
your dorm computer cluster's homepage)
and click on them everyday. Sponsors pay
for food to be given to hungry families
from around the world. There are no
catches to these websites, and they are
legitimate. Fora family starving in an
underdeveloped country, this could
make all the difference. Please set them as

your homepage and tell all your friends
about it.
3. Educate yourself. (Jo to a search
engine and type in hunger. One of the
causes of hunger, 1 would argue, is the
relationship between First World and
Third World countries. As long as First
World countries' policies are neo-imperi
alistic (including tying Third World coun
tries into a never-ending cycle of debt),
then hunger and malnutrition will con
stantly be a problem for most of the
world. However, there are a plethora of
other causes, so please educate yourself
and e-mail me with any suggestions.

I hese are merely a few things one c an
do to assist in the light against hunger.
We thank all of those who participated in
the Kith Annual Hunger Awareness
Week, and we beg the Stanford commu
nity to help us iu the fight against hunger.
It is a dire situation, and we need all the
help we can gel.
