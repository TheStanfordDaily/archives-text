## Tennis foes fall prey to Cardinal Women succeed against Weber State and Fresno despite Irvin's upset 
### BILL HANSON STAFF WRITER 
This weekend saw one of the
biggest upsets of the 1999-2000 col
legiate tennis season as 41 st-ranked
Kim Niggemeyer of Fresno State
toppled Stanford's Marissa Irvin,
the nation's No. 1 player, 6-4, 4-6,
6-2, in Saturday's second round
match ol the NCAA Team Cham
pionships.
The top-ranked Cardinal (27-0,
8-0 Pacific 10 Conference), howev
er, still prevailed over 39th-ranked
Fresno State, 5-1, to advance to the
round of 16, which will he contest
ed this weekend in Malibu, Calif.
Niggemeyer handed Irvin her
first loss of the season, snapping the
sophomore star's 20-match win
ning streak.
Irvin seemed unsettled
throughout the two-hour en
counter, questioning line calls and
struggling with her serve. Nigge
meyer, meanwhile, exploited her
opponent's inconsistency, playing
smart, patient tennis and passing
Irvin at will whenever she ventured
to the net.
Irvin also seemed out of sorts on
Friday, when the Cardinal swept
past Weber State, 6-0, in its first

round match.
Although she beat Lenka
Zacharova, 6-4, 6-2, at No. 1 sin
gles, Irvin's first serve percentage
was unusually low, and she sprayed
a slew of uncharacteristic unforced
errors in the first set.
"Marissa will get through this,"
said senior Teryn Ashley. "I'm
sure she'll be stronger by next
weekend."
Despite Irvin's spotty play, the
Cardinal seems primed to defend
its NCAA, team title this weekend.
Irvin should return to her champi
onship form, while the rest of the
Cardinal squad is currently playing
loose, confident tennis.
In Friday's first-round match
with Weber State, three Cardinal
players — sophomore Lauren
Kalvaria and seniors Ashley and
Jennifer Heiser — defeated their
opponents, 6-0,6-0.
"I've had two weeks of practice
with no matches," said Ashley, who
has struggled this season while re
covering from tendinitis in her
wrist.
"The practice helped me pick
up my confidence. It's nice to have
an easy match. I proved today that
the game I've been looking for all
season is still there."
At No. 2 singles, freshman
Laura Granville, ranked third in
the nation, beat Weber State's
Therina Steenkamp, 6-3, 6-2.
