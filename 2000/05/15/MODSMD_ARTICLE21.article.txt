## Tennis foes fall prey to Cardinal Women succeed against Weber State and Fresno despite Irvin's upset 
### BILL HANSON STAFF WRITER 
This weekend saw one of the
biggest upsets of the 1999-2000 col
legiate tennis season as 41 st-ranked
Kim Niggemeyer of Fresno State
toppled Stanford's Marissa Irvin,
the nation's No. 1 player, 6-4, 4-6,
6-2, in Saturday's second round
match ol the NCAA Team Cham
pionships.
The top-ranked Cardinal (27-0,
8-0 Pacific 10 Conference), howev
er, still prevailed over 39th-ranked
Fresno State, 5-1, to advance to the
round of 16, which will he contest
ed this weekend in Malibu, Calif.
Niggemeyer handed Irvin her
first loss of the season, snapping the
sophomore star's 20-match win
ning streak.
Irvin seemed unsettled
throughout the two-hour en
counter, questioning line calls and
struggling with her serve. Nigge
meyer, meanwhile, exploited her
opponent's inconsistency, playing
smart, patient tennis and passing
Irvin at will whenever she ventured
to the net.
Irvin also seemed out of sorts on
Friday, when the Cardinal swept
past Weber State, 6-0, in its first

round match.
Although she beat Lenka
Zacharova, 6-4, 6-2, at No. 1 sin
gles, Irvin's first serve percentage
was unusually low, and she sprayed
a slew of uncharacteristic unforced
errors in the first set.
"Marissa will get through this,"
said senior Teryn Ashley. "I'm
sure she'll be stronger by next
weekend."
Despite Irvin's spotty play, the
Cardinal seems primed to defend
its NCAA, team title this weekend.
Irvin should return to her champi
onship form, while the rest of the
Cardinal squad is currently playing
loose, confident tennis.
In Friday's first-round match
with Weber State, three Cardinal
players — sophomore Lauren
Kalvaria and seniors Ashley and
Jennifer Heiser — defeated their
opponents, 6-0,6-0.
"I've had two weeks of practice
with no matches," said Ashley, who
has struggled this season while re
covering from tendinitis in her
wrist.
"The practice helped me pick
up my confidence. It's nice to have
an easy match. I proved today that
the game I've been looking for all
season is still there."
At No. 2 singles, freshman
Laura Granville, ranked third in
the nation, beat Weber State's
Therina Steenkamp, 6-3, 6-2.
Granville seemed rusty against
Steenkamp, who frustrated the
Cardinal star with drop shots and
off-pace spins. It was obvious that
Granville, who has been sidelined
with torn ligaments in her ribcage,
hadn't played many matches in re
cent weeks.
Nonetheless, by Saturday,
Granville was again hitting the ball
with authority, pounding past
Fresno Suite's Kandiss Creighton,
6-0, 6-2.
At No. 3 singles, Ashley cruised
past Renee Kops-Jones, 6-1, 6-2,
while Kalvaria topped Liesl Ficht
bauer, 6-4, 6-3. Heiser again won
6-0, 6-0 at the No. 6 position.
Sophomore Gabriela Lastra
clinched the victory with a hard
fought 4-6, 6-0, 6-3 win over
Fresno State's Anke Beier at No.
5 singles.
Lastra, who is known both for
her talent and her tendency to be
come distracted during matches,
seemed focused throughout the
weekend.
"For me, it's all about being
competitive and really concentrat
ing," Lastra said. "I just have to stay
intense and focus in every match. I
need to take every point just as se
riously the next point."
The Cardinal will need all of its
focus next weekend when it com
petes against the rest of the nation's
top teams for the NCAA team title.
"Fresno State gave us all we
wanted," said Stanford head coach
Frank Brennan. "We got some
competitive juices flowing today
and played well. I like our draw in
Malibu and think we're in a g(x>d
position.
"There will be some great teams
down there, so we'll have to be both
lucky and good."
