breezed through the first two
rounds of the NCAA Team Cham
pionships with a pair of 4-0 wins
over Northwestern (11-12) and
Auburn (15-10).
The Cardinal will now head to
Athens, Ca. to compete in the final
four rounds of the tournament and
try to capture its fifth national team
championship in the past six years.
Stanford will play Minnesota on
May 20 in the third round of the
tournament.
Despite two hours and 45 min
utes of rain delays, the Cardinal
persevered through difficult condi
tions to defeat the Tigers on Sun
day afternoon and advance to the
next round.
"We're excited to be going back
to Ceorgia," said Stanford head
coach Dick Could. "It was a close
match and our players did a good
job staying focused through the
rain delays. We got our kinks out
yesterday (against Northwestern)
and that helped us play well today."
After splitting the first two dou
bles matches, the crucial doubles
point came down to the No. 3 spot
where juniors Scotty Scott and Ali
Ansari defeated Ryan Sanders and
Marcel Mizerski, 8-4. With the

match tied 4-4, the tenacious Car

Shore. "[Stanford] was too tough
for us in singles, but we fought hard
all year."
The Cardinal advanced to the
second round with an easy victory
over Northwestern on Saturday af
ternoon.
Stanford opened its tournament
play by sweeping all three doubles
matches against the Wildcats.
