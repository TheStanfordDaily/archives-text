persevered through difficult condi
tions to defeat the Tigers on Sun
day afternoon and advance to the
next round.
"We're excited to be going back
to Ceorgia," said Stanford head
coach Dick Could. "It was a close

rain delays. We got our kinks out
yesterday (against Northwestern)
and that helped us play well today."

for us in singles, but we fought hard
all year."
The Cardinal advanced to the
second round with an easy victory
over Northwestern on Saturday af

is in my dorm, and a lot of guys
from our dorm came to watch. We

but for the most part we did a
good job today.
"Our goal was to get to the
tournament, and we did that. I'm
also happy because I saw a lot of
growth in this team over the last
few weeks."
