# Baseball can end Dons' misery with victory
## 
### TIM KANE staff Writer 
Fifty-one down, five to go.
After what seemed like an eternit) of
preparation, followed by months upon
months of actual games, the end of the Stan
ford baseball team's regular season is almost
upon lis.
Even though the team hasn't always been
in perfect form — witness the Arizona State
series in March, where Stanford dropped two
of three, and In wide margins — it would be
difficult for even the most c ritical fan to dis
like the results, which include a 39-12 record
and first place in the l\u ili< 10 Conference
heading into the season's final week.
I he No. 2 Cardinal begins the week with a
game at San Francisco (20-32) Monday, fol
lowed bv ;i chance to revenge its earl\ season
loss to Nevada (31-17) in Reno on Tuesday.
The last week is the time of year when
everything needs to be falling into place — no
more gaping holes in the lineup, no more

shaky outings from the pitching staff, no
more mental errors.
Stanford is beginning to focus on the goal
at hand, the national championship that
eluded them last year in Omaha at the hands
of Florida State. Fortunately for head coach
Mark Marquess and the Cardinal, just about
everything is coming together nicely.
"We're swinging the bats very well lately
and have played some solid defense," said
Marquess.
It wouldn't be much of a stretch to say no
one at the moment is swinging the bat better
than second baseman Chris O'Riordan. The
sophomore, who eventually won the every
dav job over sophomores Andy Topham and
Scott Dragicevich at the beginning of the
year, leads the team's regulars with a .361 av
erage while maintaining a stellar .453 on-base
percentage and contributing solid defense at
second.
In the power department, senior Edmund
Muth and junior Joe Borchard head up the
('.animal's version of Murderers' Row with 15

and 14 blasts, respectively.
It'll be up to O'Riordan and the rest of
Stanford's bats to keep up their recent hot
streak at USF Monday afternoon. The Dons
shouldn't provide too many surprises for
Stanford, considering the two have scrim
maged several times during the year in addi
tion to playing a game at Sunken Diamond on
May 1.
On that day, sophomore Brian Sager,
making his first start after recovering from a
shoulder injury, limited the Dons to two hits
in four innings to grab his first win since
March. Stanford won 6-0 despite managing
only one extra-base hit out of 14 total.
USF's offense lies mainly in the powerful
swing of first baseman Taggert Bozied, a first
team Ail-American who leads the team with
14 homers and 50 RBIs and a .365 average
which is good for second on the team. Unfor
tunately for the Dons, the rest of the team
hasn't played even near their star's level.

to the city today to face the University of San Francisco at 2:30 p.m.
San Francisco has a 10-20 con
ference record on the year, stick
ing the Dons in last place of the
West Coast Conference, and en
ters Monday's game having
dropped 17 out of its last 20.
Compare that with Stanford's re
cent hot streak, during which the
Cardinal has won 18 out of 21.
The game will be LISF's last of
the season, as it can safely be said
they will not he getting a bid to
the NCAA Tournament. The
safe bet here is that Stanford will
end the Dons' dismal season with
one final defeat on their home
field.
