# Softball nabs top-four finish
## 
### EMILY DRESSEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a weekend of work, the No. 9 Stan
ford softball team (45-16, 9-12 Pacific 10
Conference) accomplished what it set out to
do; namely, snag a top-four finish in the
Pac-10.
The team just had a painfully drawn-out
way of doing it.
It took two consecutive losses and two
days of play to finally shock the Cardinal
into gear and spark a victory over the No. 5
team in the country, Arizona State.
In its final regular season games of the
season, Stanford hosted No. 2 Arizona (51-
7, 14-4) and No. 5 Arizona State (40-18, 8-
13), anxious to defend its one game confer
ence lead over the Sun Devils.
"There was so much riding on that game
as far as the conference seeding, it being the
last home game of the season and the se
niors' last game," said sophomore center
fielder Jessica Mendoza. "We just had so
much to play for."
Going into the weekend, Stanford knew
a loss to the Wildcats would not be as im

pairing as dropping two to Arizona State, at
least in terms of claiming the crucial fourth
seed in the conference. Stanford needed at
least a split with the Sun Devils to maintain
its conference lead.
Finishing among the top lour teams in
the Pac-10 boasts significant advantages in
regional placements for postseason play
over lower finishers.
Thus, when the Cardinal dropped a 9-0
five inning match-up to Arizona Friday af
ternoon, all hope was not lost.
The Arizona players got a good jump in
the first and then pounded the Cardinal
defense in the fourth, scoring seven
straight runs.
Facing Arizona ace Jennie Finch (25-2),
the home team mustered only three hits all
game, including one from sophomore first
baseman Sarah Beeson, who recorded her
16th double of the season.
Freshman Maureen LeCoctj pitched the
first three innings before fellow freshman
Fori Nyberg came in during the fourth to
close out the slaughter.
