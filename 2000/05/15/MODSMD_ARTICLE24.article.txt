# Softball nabs top-four finish
## 
### EMILY DRESSEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a weekend of work, the No. 9 Stan
ford softball team (45-16, 9-12 Pacific 10
Conference) accomplished what it set out to
do; namely, snag a top-four finish in the
Pac-10.
The team just had a painfully drawn-out
way of doing it.
It took two consecutive losses and two
days of play to finally shock the Cardinal
into gear and spark a victory over the No. 5
team in the country, Arizona State.
In its final regular season games of the
season, Stanford hosted No. 2 Arizona (51-
7, 14-4) and No. 5 Arizona State (40-18, 8-
13), anxious to defend its one game confer
ence lead over the Sun Devils.
"There was so much riding on that game
as far as the conference seeding, it being the
last home game of the season and the se
niors' last game," said sophomore center
fielder Jessica Mendoza. "We just had so
much to play for."
Going into the weekend, Stanford knew
a loss to the Wildcats would not be as im

pairing as dropping two to Arizona State, at
least in terms of claiming the crucial fourth
seed in the conference. Stanford needed at
least a split with the Sun Devils to maintain
its conference lead.
Finishing among the top lour teams in
the Pac-10 boasts significant advantages in
regional placements for postseason play
over lower finishers.
Thus, when the Cardinal dropped a 9-0
five inning match-up to Arizona Friday af
ternoon, all hope was not lost.
The Arizona players got a good jump in
the first and then pounded the Cardinal
defense in the fourth, scoring seven
straight runs.
Facing Arizona ace Jennie Finch (25-2),
the home team mustered only three hits all
game, including one from sophomore first
baseman Sarah Beeson, who recorded her
16th double of the season.
Freshman Maureen LeCoctj pitched the
first three innings before fellow freshman
Fori Nyberg came in during the fourth to
close out the slaughter.

Freshman Dana Sorensen struck out four and allowed
four earned runs over seven innings of work in Stanford's
4-0 loss to Arizona State on Saturday. Stanford won the
second game of the doubleheader, 4-2.
The Wildcats claimed the sea
son series after splitting with the
young Stanford team earlier in the
season in Arizona.
Saturday's first game was not
much prettier, as Stanford folded
4-0 to the Sun Devils.
Freshman Dana Sorensen (22-
8) chalked up the loss for the Car
dinal, as the Stanford offense was
unable to match the Arizona bats.
After ASU posted one run in the
first, a three-run homer by Kara
Brun to left-center clinched the
victory for the Sun Devils.
Kirsten Voak (28-9) pitched the
shutout for ASU and quieted any
chance of a Stanford comeback
with eight strikeouts.
The second game of the day

started much the same way, as the
Sim Devils took an early 2-0 lead.
Finally, the Stanford squad decid
ed to step it up a notch and play
like it knows how, anxious to end
its season at home on a good note.
"I was actually excited they
came out and scored right away,"
Mendoza said. "Usually, the sec
ond games of doubleheaders are
scoreless until the very end be
cause everyone is tired and less en
ergetic. The fact that they scored
early on gave us the spark we
needed to refocus and say, 'This is
our chance to come back and take
this game.'"
The fourth was a big inning for
the Cardinal as sophomore short
stop Robin Walker sparked a mas
sive rally with her single through
the hole between third and short.
Then came Mendoza, the Pac
-10 Player of the Year and the na
tion's top batter at .479, who

smacked her 20th double to bring
home Walker and put her team on
the board.
But the excitement didn't cease
there. Mendoza's double set off an
explosion of hits from Beeson, se
nior catcher Kellie Wiginton and
freshman Cassi Brangham, who
notched two RBIs off her smash to
right.
"It always feels good in a pres
sure situation to come through for
the team," Brangham said. "But
we were confident the whole time
that we would come back We had
been hitting the ball hard all game
â€” it was just a matter of stringing a
couple hits in a row."
LeCocq (9-5) picked up the 4-2
victory, allowing only three hits
and one earned run.
Stanford will travel to Ann
Arbor, Mich, for Regional play be
ginning Thursday against Central
Michigan.
