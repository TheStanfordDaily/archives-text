# On pins and needles: women get No. 1 seed

### EMILY DRESSEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Fingers cross, toes curl and
lists clench. The room is abuzz
with mullled squeaks and squeals
as charged cell phones poise on
fidgety laps, their owners anx
iously waiting to dial home with
the big news.
In a large room within Arrilla
ga last night, among guests, fans
and coaching staff, sat 16 women,
brimming with an adorable air of
giddiness and anticipation that
showed them all to be little girls
at heart.
Sixteen women, comprising
the Stanford softball team, who
together throughout the season
missed numerous nights out with
their boyfriends, skipped the oc
casional raging frat party and de
prived themselves of countless

hours of sleep, all to follow a
dream.
After completing their final
regular season game at home this
weekend and finishing fourth in
the Pacific 10 Conference, that
dream of taking Stanford to its
first ever NCAA Softball World
Series has finally come alive.
And they gathered last night
to find out their fate.
The NCAA tournament is
upon them, where 48 of the best
teams in the country get divided
up into eight regions and duel it
out to get a bid to the World Series.
Since the Pat-10 is by far soft
ball's most competitive and tal
ented conference in the country,
there is an extra effort made to
separate those teams from the
west, leaving Stanford clueless as
to where it would play next.
When the announcer's voice
came on the microphone, the
room fell instantly silent in sus
pense of the bracket divisions.
There were the sporadic hiss
es and cheers when California's
No. 3 seed was revealed in the
Fresno bracket, but as time
ticked on, the players got more
and more restless.
Finally, after four excruciating
commercial breaks and lots of an
nouncer garble and fuss, it was
down to the final two regions.
Placement in Baton Rouge,
La. would mean a second seed
after LSU. But if Stanford wasn't
going there. . .

Could it be. ..
Yes!
A first-seed bid in Ann Arbor,
Mich, above the hometown team,
the Michigan Wolverines, who
stole an extra-innings game from
Stanford early on in the season in
San Diego.
"Once you get to this point, it
really doesn't matter who you
play because everyone is good,"
said senior catcher Kellie Wigin
ton.
"But getting the No. 1 seed
definitely gives you some advan
tage by matching you up with the
No. 6 seed.
"We're just happy we get to
play Michigan again. We want
some revenge."
Stanford is slotted to play
Central Michigan (28-11) on
Thursday to kick off the double
elimination tournament, a team

that Rittman feels could be the
toughest No. 6 seed in the coun
try, having won the Mid-Ameri
can Conference.
"You have to earn your way to
the World Series," Rittman said.
"There are no gimmes in Re
gional. But the girls are happy
about getting the chance to go
somewhere where they've never
gone before and play teams they
typically don't get to compete
against."
So sit tight and buckle up.
What lies ahead is the harsh,
unyielding world of Regionals â€”
where there are no take-backs or
second chances, and the past is
meaningless.
Every game counts. Post-sea
son is do or die. The weak and
gutless need not apply.
This is the time when only the
fittest survive.
