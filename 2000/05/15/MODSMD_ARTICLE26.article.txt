### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
On Saturday, 400 elementary school students in
vaded the campus to take part in the fifth annual "Ex
ploring New Worlds" activities day.
The event began at 9 a.m. with a welcome at Ter
man Auditorium, followed by workshops on engi
neering and science. They covered topics including
Web design, fluid dynamics, DNAand a replica show
ing how the Titanic sank.
At 1 p.m., the kids took part in a competition in the
Engineering Quad to design their own catapults. The
announcement of victors was followed by the closing
ceremonies at 4 p.m.
The event was sponsored by the Society of Women
Engineers. Senior Katie Braden, a vice president of
tlie society, explained that they received a $7,000
grant from a private family and $2,000 in donations.
"This is fine. 1 am enjoying the workshops," said
Kevin Yao, a fourth-grade participant from
Eairmeadow School in Palo Alto.
"It is fun to get to learn things you don't know
about," said Loshante Sate, a fifth grader from Blos
som Valley School in San Jose. "Right now, for in
stance, we are finding different bacteria in different
places."
The event was enjoyable for volunteers as well.

"It's kind of fun to work with kids," said David Neo,
a master's student in Engineering-Economic Systems
and Operations Research and a volunteer. "Most of
these kids don't know about these things, and its
good to see their interested faces .... it's a fulfilling
experience.
"It's good to know that these kids will get some
thing out of ["Exploring New Worlds"] and do some
thing in the future," he added.
According to Braden, "Many of these students
come from schools with predominantly minority stu
dents in the Bay Area."
Teachers present viewed the event as a learning
experience for the students.
"After the event, we often receive feedback from
the teachers," said senior Tomtor Varutbangkul, a
vice president of SWE and a chemical engineering
major who was organizing the event for the fourth
time.
"It is good so far," said Dennis I . Bailey, a teacher
at Silver Creek High School in San Jose and parent of
one of the participants. "The young kids are exposed
to new things for the first time."
The Stanford Chapter of the Society of Women
Engineers was founded 12 years ago to foster the per
sonal growth of women pursuing careers in science
and engineering.
