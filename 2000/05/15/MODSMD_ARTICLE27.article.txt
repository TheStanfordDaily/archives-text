### EILEEN CHAO STAFF WRITER 
I he Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center received the Golden
Acorn Award from the Menlo Park
Chamber of Commerce last night
for something seemingly unrelat
ed to its usual scientific goals â€”
community service.
But SLAC director Jonathan
Dorian explained that the center's
community education programs
are actually an extension ot the
center's academic program.
"We have faculty here at SLAC,
so leaching and education is part
of what we do," I )orfan said. "I just
wanted to extend this education to
the community."
SLAC provides guest speakers
in the sciences to nearby elemen
tary schools and donates various
types of surplus equipment to pub
lic schools. According to a press re
lease. more than half of the 10,000
visitors who tour SLAC each year
are school-aged children.
"Education activities such as

tours and guest speakers are di
rectly related to our education mis
sion, which is to train the next gen
eration of scientists and engineers
and to contribute to public science
literacy," said SLAC Public Rela
tions Direc tor I'. A. Moore.
Educational programs are not
SLAC's only contributions to the
community. The center was also
honored for its other service pro
grams and 30-year involvement
with the Menlo Park Chamber of
('ommerce.
SLAC hosts four blood drives a
year and sets up collections for the
needy during the holidays. Ac
cording to Moore, over 800
pounds of food were collected by
the center last year.
The center also collects other
items to donate to nearby charities.
"SI AC travelers bring back the
small hotel-size shampoos and
soaps, and I then take them to the
Boys and Girls Club of Menlo
Park," Moore said. "Last year they
had over 100 pounds of these toi
letries, and they were used in part

for the children when they went on
a camping trip."
SI AC also worked to increase
environmental awareness, includ
ing creating a carpool program
during the oil crisis of the 19705.
"SLAC was so far out of
town .. .we had to arrange trans
portation ... so people could get
to work," said Doug Dupen, for
mer human resources manager
for the center. "And this was before
the word carpool was even in the
language."
Dorfan said he plans for the
center to be even more involved in
public service programs. 1 le creat
ed a 30-member task force that will
look for new ways to contribute to
the community, especially
through public education. They
will report their findings in July.
"I decided we should be doing
more community outreach," Dor
fan said. "We want to focus on pro
moting science literacy in the com
munity, to give people a chance to
learn more about science."
Because SIAC is operated by

Stanford University and receives
funding from the Department of
Energy, Dorian said he feels that
helping the communit) is a logical
thing to d< >.
"We're funded by taxpayers,"
Dorian said. "So it seems appro
priate to give back to our com
munity."
Dorfan said receiving the Acorn
Award was "simply wonderful."
"The fact that the community
values ns is very heartwarming,"
Dorfan said. "Its very good for
SIAC and lor the University. We
are very grateful that the commu
nity cherishes and appreciates us."
