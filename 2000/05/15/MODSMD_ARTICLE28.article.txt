### JESSICA TUCKER-MOHL EDITORIAL STAFF 
I Ik* ASSU Constitutional Council ruled on
Friday that the ASSU election results will stand,
pending a final hearing on I uesday.
The Council voted unanimously last l ues
day that the demerits system used in the ASSU
presidential election was unconstitutional be
cause it violated the privacy of those charged
with elections violations, but was split on Friday
as to whether the elections were an "act stem
ming" from the demerit system.
The Council, deciding cases for the first time

in its four years of existence, has the power to
invalidate any act ruled to be strongly affected
by constitutional violations. Had a majority of
the Council found the original presidential
election, the Undergraduate Senate election or
the class presidents election to be an "act stem
ming" from the demerits system, the results
could have been invalidated.
Council Chair Harris Shapiro, a physics doc
toral student, and Council member Robert Rud
nitsky, a doctoral student in applied physics,
voted that the election stemmed from the de
merit system. Council members David Lin, a
sophomore, and Shaumo Sadhukhan, a junior,

voted that it did not. Council member Klizabeth
Loboa Polefka, a mechanical engineering <lch -
toral student, was absent Irom the pnxeedings.
The Council has already found two c harges
relating to the demerits system to be unconsti
tutional, and has also found unconstitutional
parts of a third, related to campaign restric
tions. Hearings on three remaining charges will
take place on Tuesday.
The charges were originally filed with the
Council by five members of the Craduate Stu
dent Council on April 2f>. ASSU President Mike
Levin joined on two of the charges but subse
quently dropped his name from them.
