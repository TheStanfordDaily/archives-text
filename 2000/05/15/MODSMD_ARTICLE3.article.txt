When people beat the dram,s it's a prayer. When people rook
food, it's a prayer. When they talk it's a prayer, and when they
listen to people talking, it's a prayer."
— Willy Santistevan, a member of the Sioux tribe

Stanford Powwow is the largest university
powwow and the fifth largest in the country.
Ihe powwow serves to both unify tlie na
tive community at Stanford and to represent
their diversity. Yvonne Yaz/.ie, administrator
of the environmental program at the I .aw

Powwows have dancers from different tribes,
songs from different tribes and different lan
guages. If you go to enough, you get a sense
of how diverse the community is."
I lie powwow is a student-run and orga

nized event. Preparation starts in September
and goes until the end of the year. It "takes
up a lot of our time and often our classes may
suffer, but those are things we're willing to
sacrifice to continue Stanford Powwow's ex

One of the vendors joked about the appli

Valerie Siovv, who is in charge of vender

been coming to powwow for years, who have
originality and authenticity in their art."
SAIO was founded in 1970 by four Native
American Stanford students.
