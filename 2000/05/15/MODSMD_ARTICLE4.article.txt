# Undergrad TAs up to the challenge
## 
### UDARA FERNANDO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Undergraduate sec tion leaders and
teaching assistants are paid less than
their graduate student counterparts —
who often receive substantial tuition
breaks — despite handling roughh the
same workload in some departments.
Hut lew undergraduates in the (Com
puter Science Department — which em
ploys large numbers of undergraduate
section leaders — seem to feel that they
are being taken advantage of by the
University.
Double standard?
For their first quarter of section lead
ing, undergraduate section leaders lor
introductory computer science classes
aren't paid but receive four units of aca

demic credit. II they choose to continue
in the section leading program, they are
paid $ 12 per hour.
(1< (terminal and graduate students in
the computer science section leading
program are eligible for either the
hourly $ 12 compensation or a ' 1 Aship,'
which includes tuition credit and a
stipend. I he tuition credit and stipend
can add up to $5,000.
Differences in compensation be
tween undergraduate and graduate stu
dent section leaders and TAs are even
more evident in other departments.
Ariel Lavinbuck, a cotenninal stu
dent in International Policy Studies,
said that he receives full tuition plus on
campus housing, in addition to a week
ly stipend of about $200 as a graduate
teaching assistant lot a political science
course. 1 .avinbuck has been a I A lor two

classes: Political Science I.'MB,"America
and the World Kcononi)." and Political
143F "Major Issues in International
(Conflict Management."
I ndergraduate teaching assistants in
Public Policx 50, "Issues in Public Poli
cy." receive $750 per quarter for their
work.
"Our main responsibility is to pre
pare lot and lead section." said senior
Lea Bonnecaze, a 1 A lor the class. She
said the lAs also correct quizzes and
grade one paper.
Ryan Kvgg, a senior majoring in
Physics, current 1\ serves as a teaching
assistant in the Physics 10 series. I le said
that in the Phvsics Department, under
graduates get compensated only about
one-hall to one-third .is much as gradu-
ates lor the same amount of work.
Different workloads and
responsibilities
"We have a staff of about 50 un
dergrads each quarter acting as
section leaders for the 1065,"
wrote computer science cotermi
nal students Jan Chong and Jed
Burgess, the coordinators tor the
section leader program, in an e
mail. " The head TAs for these
classes, however, are graduate or
coterminal students."
Section leaders differ from
teaching assistants in that the for
mer deal purely with grading and
teaching, while the latter also ad
dress class administrative issues.

Computer Science Lecturer
Julie Zelenski stressed that the rea
son for hiring many undergrads as
section leaders, at least in the 106
program, is not to save money, but
in the interests of providing stu
dents with a better education.
According to Zelenski, when
the University first offered com
puter science classes, section lead
ers were "super-abstract-theoreti
cal people wlio were far removed
from the needs of the average
freshman in 106A."
"Undergraduate section lead
ers relate to students better be
cause the material is still fresh in
their minds," she said.
Chong and Burgess agreed.
Undergraduates "have shared the
same course experience, as op
posed to grad students who may
have done their undergraduate
work somewhere else," they wrote

in an e-mail.
Zelenski also cited ( lass size as a
determining factor in hiring many
undergraduate section leaders in
the CS program.
"In a class taught by a graduate
student, the section leader to stu
dent ratio tends to be about one to
40 or one to 50," she said. "By hir
ing more undergrads, we can get
ratios of one to 10 or one to 12.
This means that they [undergrad
uates] are less overworked and
have more contact with students."
Some students also believe that
the relatively low compensation
structure helps weed out under
graduates who are not sincerely
interested in teaching.
"Right now, most undergradu
ates are interested in teaching for
it's own sake, rather than as a
source of income, which I think
keeps the average quality of un
dergraduate TAs fairly high,"
Rygg added.
No lack of enthusiasm
Manus pointed out that it is ad
vantageous for undergraduates to
participate in the computer sci
ence section leader program be
cause it significantly increases
their chances for future employ
ment.
"Section leaders from this par
ticular program are very highly
recruited by tech companies,"
Manus said.
Irrespective of compensation,
students — undergraduate, grad
uate, or coterminal — still value
their experience as a TA.
1 ve always enjoyed helping
others understand subject matter
that I've understood," Rygg said.
"I've found that teaching is an ex
cellent way of learning. You need
to know a topic a lot better to teach
it than to take a test on it."
