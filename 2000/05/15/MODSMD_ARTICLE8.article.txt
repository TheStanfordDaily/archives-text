Funds cut for earthquake
detection technology
PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — Southern California's ad
vanced seismic-monitoring system faces a shaky future
— and not because of the earthquakes it locates and an
alyzes minutes after the ground stops moving.
Money for the system, known as TriNet, is set to be
halved next year and end completely in 2002 as the grant
that established the system expires. So far nobody has of
fered to pay an estimated $2 million in annual mainte
nance costs.
"I don't get it," said Lucy Jones, scientist in charge of
the U.S. (Geological Survey's Pasadena field office. "Peo
ple don't understand what it is that we're doing."
TriNet uses advanced seismometers and computers
to capture data and uniformly analyze it. Within minutes
of a quake, it maps regions of intensity and probable
hardest-hit areas. Rescue crews then can be dispatched,
engineers can monitor weakened buildings and utilities
can target repair crews.
TriNet is primarily funded with Federal Emergency
Management Agency grants made after the 1994 North
ridge quake. The networks at that time helped deter
mine its size and epicenter, but could not discern pock
ets of intensity and some data were thrown off-scale by
such a large quake.
ACADEMIA
NIH sees funding increase
WAS I fINC TON, D.C. — The Senate Appropriations
Committee unanimously approved a bill Thursday that
would increase the budget of the National Institutes of
Health by $2.7-billion, to $20.5-billion, and raise the
maximum Pell (Grant by $350, to $3,050 in the 2001 fis
cal year.
The legislation is more generous to student aid and
the N.1.1 1. than the version of the spending bill approved
by a House of Representatives subcommittee on Tues
day. I hat bill would increase the N.1.1 I.'s budget by $1 -
billion, to $ 18.8-billion, and raise the maximum Pell
(Grant by $200, to $3,500.
lawmakers hope to have a Senate vote on the bill by
Memorial Day, but its fate is uncertain. President (ilinton
vowed on Wednesday to veto the legislation because it
does not guarantee funds for some of his top priorities in
elementary and secondary education, like school reno
vation and reduc ing class size.

Survivors commemorate
20th anniversary of Mt.
St. Helens eruption
CASTLE R()(-K, Wash. (AP) — The blast came with
out warning, snapping trees and engulfing Jim Scy
manky and three other loggers in a suflbcating wave of
hot, black ash from Mount St. I Iclens.
()n Sunday, Scymanky was among more than a dozen
survivors who gathered as part of an ongoing observance
of the 20th anniversary of the May IA, 1980, eruption
that killed 57 people and stunned scientists with its fe
rocity. I he event was held at the Silver Lake Visitor Cen
ter, located about 45 miles west of the mountain.
I le has been back several times to the area where he
believes — lie's not sure because the eruption complete
ly transformed the landscape around the mountain —
he almost died. "Today, I still can't believe I made it out
of there," he said.
