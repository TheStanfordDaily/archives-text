1989
In a May 16, 1989 issue of The Stanford
Daily, student protesters were arrested after
a full-day occupation of Building 10.
"Police arrested at least 55 students yes
terday after protesters seized and occupied
University President Donald Kennedy's of}
fice for almost 10 hours, demanding a face?
to-face meeting with Kennedy . ..
[A]t 7:40 a.m., about 50 students entered
the first floor windows of Building 10,
where the President's Office is located, the
students ordered a secretary and Asst. to the
President Boh I iamrdla to leave.
The occupiers demanded a meeting with
Kennedy to discuss their "Agenda for Ac
tion." The agenda lists priorities for imple
menting the proposals in the University
Committee on Minority Issues report, in
cluding the immediate hiring of a professor
of Asian-American history, the hiring of a
full-time Chicano community dean, and the
establishment of a Discrimination Griev
ance Board." .
The Bottom Line: When was the last time you
got up at 7:40 a.m.?
