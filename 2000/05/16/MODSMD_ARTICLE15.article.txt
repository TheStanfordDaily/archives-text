## Indiana University punishes but retains Knight 
### 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Hob Knight will
remain basketball coach at Indiana but must
sit out tlitee games next season and pay a
$3Q,000 line for his "pattern of inappropriate
behavior."
"I think the ethical approach is to give him
one last chance," school president Myles
Brand said at a news conference yesterday.
Knight must also follow a supervised code
of conduct and he will be fired immediately if
he violates it or has physical contact with any
player or university employee. Brand said. I le
described the sanctions as a "zero-tolerance
policy."
Knight was investigated by the school after
former player Neil Reed accused the coach of
choking him during a1997 practice that was
caught on videotape. During the investigation
other accusations of verbal and physical abuse
emerged.
"I le has given me his word that he will take
extraordinary steps to change behavior,"
Brand said.
"We have established tough, specific guide
lines to send a clear message that abusive and
embarrassing behavior will not be tolerated."
Brand detailed the sanctions one day after
trustees met in private to discuss their investi
gation into Knight's behavior. The trustees
then turned over Knight's fate to Brand.
"There are no sacred cows at Indiana Uni
versitv and that certainly includes the basket

ball coach," trustees president John 1). YValda
said.
Brand said he met with Knight on Saturday
to discuss his future.
"The conversation I had with Bob was
clearly unique," he said. "1 had never seen him
before contrite and apologetic."
He said he had considered firing Knight.
"As the discussion proceeded and Bob
expressed the view that lie very much wanted
to change his behavior . . . then we began to
talk about sanctions," Brand said.
Knight, who has won three national cham
pionships in his 29 years at the school, did not
attend the news conference. But Walcla read a
statement in which Knight said: "I recogni/e I
have a problem with my temper ... 1 am sin
cerely sorry."
On Saturday, the day before the trustee's
meeting, the 59-year-old Knight issued a state
ment in which he first apologi/ed for his tem
per and acknowledged lie needs to be "more
diplomatic." I le did not apologize to indi\ idu
als or for specific episodes.
In addition to the three national titles, the
Hall of Fame coach guided the U.S. Olympic
team to a gold medal in 1984. But his success
es often were overshadowed In his bulbing
behavior on and off the court — from throw
ing chairs to profane outbursts against the
media, players, finis and university employees.
In March, Brand appointed two trustees to

investigate Reed's accusation.
Reecl left the program in 1997 and trans
ferred to Southern Mississippi alter claiming
he was physically and mentally abused by
Knight.
lie did not elaborate in public at the time,
but an interview with CNN/Sports Illustrated,
aired just before the start of this year's NCAA
tournament in March, led to the investigation.
Indiana ended up losing its first-round
NCAA game against Pepperdine, putting
Knight's overall record, including six years at
Army, at 703-290. 1 le is 001-240 and has won
1 I Big Ten titles with the Moosiers.

although he admitted he may have grabbed
him to move him to ;i specific spot on the floor
during practice.
Othei charges began to surface, including
one in which Knight allcgedlv attacked assis
tant coach Ron Felling in November. Felling
left the team five days later.
Knight also reportedlv dashed with athletic
direct!>r (llarence Doninger after a loss late last
season. A university secretary, Jeanette Hart
graves, said this month that 12 years ago
Knight threw a vase that shattered near her,
and that in 1998 he cursed her and had to be
restrained by Doninger.
