# Rape trials ruled state issue
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AF) — Rape victims cannot
sue their attackers in federal court, the Supreme
Court ruled yesterday, saying it is up to tlie states —
not Congress — to give such help to women victim
ized by violence.
The 5-4 ruling threw out a key provision of the
1994 Violence Against Women Act and continued
the courts trend of expanding states' lights at the
expense of the federal government.
" The Constitution requires a distinction between
what is truly national and what is truly local," Chief
justice William 11. Rehnquist wrote for the court.
The justices barred a federal lawsuit by former
Virginia lech student Christy Br/.onkala against
two football players she says raped her in a dormi
tory room.
Br/.onkala "alleges that she was the victim of a
brutal assault,'" Rehnquist said. "If the allegations
here are true, no civilized system of justice could
fail to provide her a remedy .... But under our
federal system that remedy must be provided by
the commonwealth of Virginia, and not by the
United States."
Kathy Rodgers of the NOW Legal Defense and
Education Fund, which represented Brzonkala,
said, "1 consider this to be a severe blow for
women's rights because of the chilling effect it will
have on Congress."
"Congress identified a kind of gender discrimi
nation," Rodgers said. "Congress is trying to
address that with a creative, specific solution and
the court says, 'No, you can't do that.'"
Attorney Michael F. Rosman, who argued the
case on behalf Of the two men sued by Brzonkala,
called the ruling "a very good day for the Constitu
tion and the rule of law." People who allege they
are victims of gender-based violence "have perfect
ly good remedies instate court," lie said,
"the decision affirmed a federal appeals court

decision that threw out Br/onkala's lawsuit against
student athletes Antonio Morrison and James
Crawford. Brzonkala has allowed her name to be
disclosed.
"(lender-motivated crimes of violence are not, in
any sense of the phrase, economic activity,' Rehn
quist said. Ihe justices rejec ted arguments by
Br/onkala's lawyer and the Clinton administration
that the law was needed because states are not
doing enough to protect rape victims, and because
gender-based violence restricts women's c hoices in
jobs and travel.
That.argument "would allow Congress to regu
late any crime as long as the nationwide, aggregat
ed impact of that crime has substantial effects on
employment, production, transit or consumption,"
Rehnquist said. "Indeed, if Congress may regulate
gender-motivated violence, it would be able to reg
ulate minder or any other type of violence.'
I he case is a lollow-up to the Supreme Court's
1995 ruling that struck down as unconstitutional a
law that made it a federal crime to possess a gun
within 1,000 led of a school. I lie justices said gun
possession was not siillicientl\ linked to interstate
commerce and that the law usurped state authority
over such c rimes.
"1 don't know what's next in line," Sen. Joseph
Biden, l)-l)el., who sponsored the Violence Against
Women Act, said yesterday. " I he court rcallv went
off here in a way that 1 find cxlremelv trouble
some."
At the White I louse, President Clinton issued a
statement saying he is "cleeplv disappointed" that
victims may no longer sue in federal court.
"Because 1 continue to believe that there should
be remedies for victims of gender-motivated vio
lence, we plan to study the Supreme Court's deci
sion ... to determine the best means to help these
victims," Clinton said.
