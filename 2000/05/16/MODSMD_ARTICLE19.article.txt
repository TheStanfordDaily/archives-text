## EDITOR'S NOTEBOOK The
						Daily's mission re-focuses on issues of diversity 
### RITU BHATNAGAR EDITORIAL STAFF 
For a rare few moments, I look the
time this past week to flip
through tlu' newspapers of this
volume — which was especially
interesting for me in light of the fact that
wc close up shop here in a little over two
weeks.
As I glanced over the mass of head
lines, photos and text from the past three
months, there were a number of issues
that jumped out at me from the
newsprint: complaints on the post office,
the Stanford presidential search, contro
versies over ASSU elections . . .
But it was a series of student letters on
the presentation of minorities in the
media, news articles on the slew of racist
e-mails and administrators' suggestions
for ways to work toward change, that
seemed to me, as I leafed through the
papers, one of the most compelling
issues that keenly affected students. The
Daily, and myself as the paper's editoi.

Open dialogues have been spread
across I lie Daily's pages this volume
about how to make the campus, and hit
ting dose to home, The Daily, more cul
turally sensitive. This, fundamentally,
has been an important focus of staff
members this volume and is something
I've tome to consider a critical compo
nent of creating a newspaper every day.
Student dissatisfaction with the lack
of diversity in I lie Daily's coverage is
certainly not a new issue for the paper,
as many of the roots of this dissatisfac
tion date back several years. And, stu
dents' comments have not always been
centered around matters of culture, hut
have ranged from coverage of club
sports to gender issues to (lass differ
ences.
What lias often been brought up by
our readership are concepts that other
newspapers face nation-wide: How do
we present coverage that appeals to a
broad base of individuals? And how do
we ensure that our own staff reflects the
diversity present in the community?

The Daily, in its mission, aims to edu
cate and train students as journalists
and to provide them with the experi
ence of producing a newspaper and
working collectively as a stall — valu
able know-how that can guide them in
whatever routes they choose after col
lege. Our other, equally important goal
is to serve the Stanford community as
au informational source and to report
about the University and its issues iu a
balanced, far-reaching fashion.
This latter aim, it seems, is what we
must work on, and we accept the chal
lenge. The Daily's staff continually
amazes me in the level of commitment it
shows to improving various aspects of
the paper — whether it be layout and
design, content or expansion of cover
age. And our project to commit to diver
sity in the pages of The Daily is some
thing that is duly significant, especially as
Stanford prepares to welcome the Class
of 2004, one of its most diverse sets of
students yet.
I he Daily's readership survey this

past November presented us with the
problem areas that we just haven't been
addressing or covering as a newspaper
— extremely helpful for staff members
as we assessed how we could ensure
that more readers felt served by the
paper.
lo make visible changes in conjunc
tion with readers' responses, we hired
our first-ever community outreach coor
dinator, senior Anne-Marie Mc Reynolds,
to network with various community cen
ters and groups on campus and to bring
the information garnered back to the
staff, while training staffers about bal
anced coverage through stories and pho
tographs. One of the most compelling
examples of Anne-Marie's endeavors is
the collaboration she has forged between
the Daily photography and news staffs
and the Native American Community
Center towards producing a special sec -
tion on the Stanford Powwow, which will
run in tomorrow's Daily.
Anne-Marie has made many efforts
this spring to also up-step recruitment

efforts to have members of traditional
ly underrepresented communities
become a part of our staff. Recruit
ment efforts will be a fundamental
focus for The Daily next fall, as we seek
to form the foundations fora staff that
is representative of the surrounding
community.
As we continue to develop our cover
age in manners that are more meaning
ful for our audience, we welcome sug
gestions, comments and criticisms. We
want to hear from you: What did you
like or dislike about a particular story?
What would you have done differently?
What issues are important to you?
In our commitment to change, I
hope that we're fulfilling both aspects of
our mission — to educate and to serve
— in a manner that's constantly evolv
ing and improving. I know I'd like to
see that change show when 1 flip
through the newspapers of future Daily
volumes, wondering what we may have
missed or what we could have done dif
ferently.
