Editor's Note: This is the first / x/rt in a
two-piece series on corporate sponsorship
oj Stanford athletic teams. Tomorrow,

deals with companies with controversial
practices.

Corporate sponsorship of Stan
lord athletics has grown to about
$6.6 million for 1999-2000, indud

ing cash pa\ incuts lor advertising,
in-kind payments and apparel
given to the teams.
"Corporate sponsorships are
very important to keep the Athlet
ics Department at the level that it
is." said Robert Carniesco, direc
tor of marketing lor the Depart
ment of Athletics. "We have 'VS vai -
sity sports, and we need to fuel that
machine."
Cash payments lor advertise
ments at Stanford sporting events
account for $15 million ol the total
sponsorship. According to Debra
Gore-Mann, associate athletic di
rector of finance and operation,
the figure is quite high this year be
cause of the recent suc c ess of many

of Stanford's athletic loams.
1 lie Athletics Department also
receives $140,000 yearly from
I'epsico lor serving the company's
soft drinks ai Stanford sporting
events.
"In-kind" sponsorships com
prise $500,000 of the figure. For
these sponsorships, companies
such :is businesses, hotels and air
lines provide their services to the
athletic teams lor live.
Apparel and equipment com
panies such as Nike also sponsor
the teams bv providing apparel
and equipment, including uni
forms, warm-up jerseys and .itlilct
ic shoes. This sponsorship totals
about $3 million per year. This fig

ure also depends on teams' suc
cess, as team members generally
receive new apparel if the team ad
vances to a national tournament.
I he apparel contracts are nego
tiated by each coach, not centrally
I>\ the Athletics Department. Car
ruesco said that the University has
c hosen this method of negotiation
even though the Athletics Depart
ment might have better negotiat
ing leverage il it represented all the
teams.
Carruesco estimated that this
year's sponsorship figure repre
sented an increase of about 20 per
cent over last year's total. He at
tributed this increase to on-the
tield success, such as the football

team's Rose Bowl appearance, and
the robust economy.
Sponsorship revenues account
lor about 15 percent of the Athlet
ics Department's budget. Car
ruesco said that Stanford, unlike

some other schools, could sustain
its ;illilcti( program without corpo
rate sponsorships bv re-allocating
resources if necessary.
