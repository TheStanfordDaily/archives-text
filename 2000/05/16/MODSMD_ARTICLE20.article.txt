# FARM LIFE
## My Stanford's top five list 
### 
I realized the other day that I don't
have very many columns left, so I've
been scrambling to think of the few
topics I had been wanting to write
about but had not yet gotten the chance
to cover. I ended up with a huge bunch
of ideas, but none seemed to spark inv
interest at the moment.
There was one common theme,
though, that linked them together: My
Stanford. I use the possessive because we
each have our own perspectives, our own
thoughts, our own feelings on the place

most of us call home.
I thought then
maybe today's column
would be a good time
to take you on a tour <>l
My Stanford, for better
or for worse, now in
the middle ol the peace
of mid-May, the calm
before the storm 11 i;ii is
the last few weeks of
school: dead day, finals

and everyone's favorite "hey!-you-have
to-move-out-in-a-day" day. (letting even
more sentimental, I thought I'd borrow a
little from Oprah's famous daily practice
of writing down five things dial made you
happy over the course of the day. So,
here goes.
One of my favorite things about the
Farm is biking through the Quad at sun
set. It sounds a little out there, I know,
but we've all experienced it. Your last
(lass of the dav has finished and the
accomplishment makes you feel a little
heady, the sun has sunk below the tree
tops, and the sandstone gives off a gold
hue (or orange if you're color-blind, like
me). Ihe tall date palms become harsh
silhouettes against a dark blue skv, and
the air is quiet with nothing but a soft
breeze.
If you're lucky, you can careen across
the Quad all by your lonesome, the only
other sound being the whirring of your
bicycle chain, as you make your way back
to the dorm for dinner and socializing.
For me, that epitomizes the Stanford
Kxperience — overwhelming, almost
magical, and truly beautiful. I think to
myself, "I low on Karth did I get in here?"
and remember how lucky I am.
It's 3:12 a.m., Tuesday morning. The
phone rings. I hat doesn't sound like a
set-up for something I love about Stan
ford, but believe it or not, it is. The jar
ring "brining!" makes me sprint out of
bed before my roommate even stirs. I
know who this is.
I pick it up and an accented voice says,
"Is the Chris Maloney? Chris? I his is Mr.
Van den Brink from the World Bank in
Harare — is it late there?" Why, yes, it is,
but who cares? I'm speaking to the head
of the friggin' World Bank office of
Ilarare!

Now, you're probably wondering why
ih.it is special, but to someone like me
who is enthralled with development eco
nomics and Africa — southern Africa, in
particular — that's a special moment.
And somehow, the exhaustion aside, it's
just so cool to be discussing the political
situation in Zimbabwe at 3:15 in the
morning, l or me, that's just so Stanford.
It's something that I never would have
even dreamed of doing two years ago,
and yet there I was. Again, all I can do is
write the profound, yet übiquitous,
"wow."
Kicker Dining. Yes, I suppose My
Stanford is a bit different than most peo
ple's. But this facet <>l'Stanford can be any
(lining hall, any place where you can sit
with your pals and talk. I just chose kick
er because where else can you have
Wanda's famous homemade ( rontons on
a freshly made salad with a plate of hand
carved roast beef and fro/en yogurt for
dessert while arguing over something
more worldly?
As a freshman, that was my favorite
part oi Stanford, and it still ranks up
there — being able to talk forever on sub
jects that in high school no one either
knew about, or tared about, or cared to
know anything about. I hose dinner-time
talks were (and are) so wonderful because
ilie\ re-affirm both my good decision in
coming here and, again, my luck in being
here alongside so many ania/ing people.
A fourth facet ol Stanford that makes
me happy is I'INK. 1 love PINK. I will
never switch to hudora, I will forever use
(tt lelaiul rather than (a Stanford, and
PINE will always take precedence over
my Web-based e-mail account. I here's
something so primitive, so visceral and
real about it.
Sometimes I feel Elaine is my only
friend in the world. It's an electronic ver
sion of my whole Stanford Experience
every time I open my folders from
months past and read some e-mail I sent
to someone.
PINE has become my chronicler, my
diary by default. I just let it save e-mail
after e-mail I'd ever sent and in turn dis
covered, two years later, that every little
action I'd done here had been recorded
and saved, along with messages I'd
received and put in "saved-messages."
PINE is so friendly; it has a better vocab
ulary than me (words like "expunge," for
example) and even asks me questions. Do
you really want to quit c maloneyC" leland?
Why, 110, IMNE, not just yet — it's all
good, and we still have two more years
together.
And, finally, a fifth thing about Stan
ford that makes me happy would be
something even more abstract — our
bizarre community. I use the word
