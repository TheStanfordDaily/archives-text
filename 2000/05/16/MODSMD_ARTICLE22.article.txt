KZSU engineer supports Foothills plan
George Beinhorn's letter ("Stanford
alum criticizes Foothills plan," May 15)
seems to be based on an inaccurate view
of history and a misunderstanding of the
current problems in the Foothills. I
helped build the KZSU transmitter site in
the Foothills in 1969 and have been
involved in its maintenance since then, so
my perspective is that of someone who
lias been a regular user of the Foothills
for over SO years.
Beinhorn says that, "for 100 years, the
University has allowed us to enjoy the
incalculable benefits of walking and run
ning in these beautiful hills." This simply
isn't true. Since the late 19405, the prima
ry University use of the Foothills has been
for radio astronomy, ionospheric studies
and other types of radio research, with
numerous sites being developed for this
purpose. The Dish is merely the most vis
ible of these.
l he use of this area for hiking and
running began during Donald Kennedy's
tenure as University president, when he
invited students to go running with him;
prior to that time, access was limited to
those on official business and those who
had obtained a pass. There were no
(legal) hikers and runners there 30 years
ago, or even 20 years ago, nor were there
any "offload" dirt trails.
He mentions "thousands of miles of
trails" in Bay Area parks, all without any
apparent environmental harm. Yes, a
trail will allow hiking without harm, if
built and maintained in a way that does
not foster erosion. The dirt trails in the

Foothills were never designed — they
were formed by hikers wherever they felt
like walking. Many of them are now turn
ing into gullies.
It would certainly be possible to con
struct "eco-friendly" trails, but the money
to do this has to come from somewhere —
and Stanford's function is education and
research, not public recreation. Con
structing and maintaining a public park is
probably not an appropriate use of Stan
ford's resources.
Stanford has been a good steward of its
lands; that's why we can now argue about
how or whether they get developed. Just
take a look up and down the Peninsula
and see how many cities have done as well
as Stanford in their land use planning.
The care of the Stanford Foothills is best
left in the hands of those who own them,
rather than those who — like Beinhorn
— would merely use them, oblivious to
the damage they cause.

Students upset by display in White Plaza
As an Israeli and a Jew, I was very dis
turbed by the anonymous exhibit yester
day in White Plaza on the so-called crimes
of the state of Israel.
In response, I could display all the
numbers of Jews who have been killed by
Arabs from the Arab riots at the begin
ning of the 20th century until the terror
attacks of the past few years. But I don't
believe that a war of numbers will get us

anywhere.
I think that, especially today, when
Israelis and Palestinians are making
progress — walking along a path to peace
— the two communities should make
efforts to break down walls rather than
building new ones. In the past year, I
have participated in the Jewish-Arab-
Muslim dialogue group, whose mission is
to create a better understanding between
these communities.
I would like to reach out to the people
who created this exhibit to join us in our
quest for peace. A copy of this letter will
be in White Plaza along with a sign-up
sheet. Please sign it and join us.

I his letter is in response to yesterday's
display in White Plaza: "Palestine: 52
Years of Oppression." While it is true that
the creation of the state of Israel has
entailed many hardships for Palestinians,
I think it is imperative that we put the
events that occurred in 1948 and after
wards in context.
The violence that occurred in 1948
was part of a war. It was not part of a vio
lent, unilateral act of ethnic cleansing on
the part of the Israelis, but was rather a
civil war between two groups who had
competing claims over a piece of land.
I his was not, and still is not, an uncom
mon situation. An extremely unfortunate,
but unavoidable part of war is that civil
ians die.
Yesterday's display showed only one
- aspect of the civilian deaths of the 1948
war of independence. Many Israeli civil
-ians died as well. Refugees are also an
inevitable consequence of war. When a
-war is won by one side, there will be
refugees.
We cannot escape the (act that these
events all happened within the context of
a war. 1 his does not make them excus
able, but it reminds us that Israelis were
not only perpetrators and Palestinians
were not only victims.
I believe that there is now a better
(.hance for peace between Israelis and
Palestinians than there has ever been.
There were injustices perpetrated on
both sides, but now I think it is more con
structive to focus on a peaceful future
than to harp on a past that criminalizes
both the Israelis and the Palestinians.
As I and the Jews of the world cele
brate 52 years of a Jewish state — a home
land where Jews from all over the world
can escape oppression — I wish to
express my joy that the state <>l Israel
exists.
At the same time, I recognize the
importance of a state to any people, and I

hope that, with future peace negotiations,
we will see (he* creation of a Palestinian
homeland as well.

Stanford University Nikkei opposes
approval of Japanese American
National Memorial
On Nov. 9, 2000, a national memorial
commemorating the struggles of
Japanese Americans will be dedicated in
our nation's capital, Washington, D.C.
While we support the spirit of this trib
ute to our community, we object to the
procedures that have been used to design
and construct it. In particular, this is
because the National Japanese American
Memorial Foundation (NJAMF) Board, a
body of 45 community elites commis
sioned to create this memorial, through
closed procedures, has selected a most
controversial quotation to be inscribed
upon it. I he quotation in question is
taken from Mike Masaoka's 1942
"Japanese American Creed," a blindly
patriotic oath that fans the model minor
ity myth.
In addition, the "Creed's" author,
Masaoka himself, is a controversial figure
in J a f >anese American history. As a resi
dent of Salt Lake City, he was never him

sell threatened with evacuation. Yet, as
national secretary and field executive of
the Japanese American Citizens League
(JACL), the only widely organized
Japanese American organization at the
time, Masaoka presumed to speak on
behalf of the entire Japanese American
community. The position he took was one
of accommodation.
JACL-afliliated Nisei today are more
concerned with rationalizing their
wartime stance than with historical accu
racy. It is they who have been largely
responsible for constructing the "main
stream" interpretation of Japanese Amer
ican history.
Consequently, those Japanese Ameri
cans who opposed the JACL's policy of
accommodation and instead resisted the
evacuation on constitutional grounds
have been written out of our community's
historical narrative. This memorial
should embrace the diversity of our past,
not the oversimplified, orthodox line.
As an organization deciding matters of
public import, we believe that the NJAMF
had an ethical obligation to consult and
inform the general public about the rele
vant issues surrounding this quotation.
Thus, we object to the high-handed pro
cedures that the NJAMF used to approve
this quotation.
We are helping to circulate a resolu
tion that calls for the National Park Ser
vice (part of the Department of the lute

rior) to reconsider its approval of the
NJAMF's proposed memorial inscrip
tions. Many influential leaders of our
community, including NJAMF Board
members, have signed on.
A copy ol the resolution, a copy of the
"Japanese American Creed," and other
background information are available at
http://www.JAVoice.com. To those mem
bers of the Stanford community who
believe in procedural fairness and oppose
monolithic portrayals of ethnic groups,
we ask you for your support.
