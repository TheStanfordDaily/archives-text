### MATTHEW BLUMENSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
Editor's Mote: This is the first of a scries of three articles cov
ering Prof. Singer's visit.
Peter Singer, Princeton's Ira W. Gamp Professor of
Bioethics at the Genter for I luman Values, will give
the first of two lectures titled "Our ()bligations to Out
siders" tonight at IS p.m. in Kresge Auditorium. The
controversial professor is known for fiis stances on
abortion, euthanasia, infanticide, animal rights and
allocation of wealth.
l onight's lecture, "Obligations Beyond National
Borders," will covet subject matter first considered iu
Singer's 1972 book, "Famine, Aflluence and Morali
ty," written at the age of 25.
According to Fori Gruen, a Mellon Post-Doctorate
112 ellow and visiting lecturer, Singer's book was largely
responsible fot the resuscitation and proliferation of
the lield of applied ethics.
Peter I'nger, a professor of philosophy at New
York University, told The Wall Street journal that
"this world-renowned Australian may well be the
most prominent professor his country has ever pro
duced; by many measures, he's the most influential
ethic ist alive."
Singer's visit, which is part of the the annual Wes
son Lectures on F.tliics in Society, has been facilitated
by Gruen, who worked with Singer in Australia as a
graduate student.
By applying the philosophical doctrine of utilitari
anism, which seeks always to maximize well-being and
minimize suffering within a given community, to
modern issues, Singer lias come to argue for limited
practices of abortion, euthanasia and infanticide.
Perhaps Singer's most controversial claim is that
"killing a disabled infant is not morally equivalent to
killing a person. Very often it is not wrong at all."
Singer has also been a seminal figure in the move

ment for animal i iglits. According to 1 lie Washington
Post, his essay "Animal Liberation" can "fairly be said
to have launched the animal rights movement in
1975." Ii has sold over 400,000 copies in 1 I lan
guages.
Singer has received media attention since his ap
pointment at Princeton, and his stances have elicited
vehement responses from both that academic com
munity and the nation as a whole.
He has drawn such notoriety that sec urity barriers
must be erected around the building in which he
teaches. Guards must check student IDs before un
locking the door, and packages for Singer bearing un
familiar return addresses .n e scanned for explosives.
Steve Forbes, a Princ eton alumnus, has pledged to
withhold all subsequent donations to the university as
long as Singer remains. Forbes said, "That someone
like that could be appointed in a prestigious ( bait is
utterly outrageous."
Another Princeton alumnus, William F. Galley,
said, "Nothing I have seen oi heard epitomizes the
decline of Western (avilization so much as the hiring
of Peter Singer to teach iu the I Diversity Genter for
I luman Values."
However, many scholars and ac tivists have had a
positive response to Singer's teachings.
Oxlani America, a charity organization dedicated
to fighting hunger, received over $75,000 iu dona
lions as a clirec I result of a New York I imes Magazine
article written by Singer.
" I he Wesson lectures are sponsored by F.tliics in
Society every year, and since ibis is my last year here
at Stanford, we tried to gel Peter Singer to come, and
fortunately be agreed," said (iruen.
When asked whether Stanford has taken any secu
rity measures in anticipation of Singer's visit, Gruen
said, "the Ft hies iu Socielv Program lias taken ade
quate precautions."
Those wishing to attend Ihe lectures will need to
present a Stanford ID. Fo (.men's knowledge, there
have been no negative responses to the lectures.
Gruen exhorts all Stanford students to attend these
lectures, not just philosophy students. " Fhese are lec
tures of global moral importance that touch the lm
manity of all of us," she said. "People may not agree
with Singer's conclusions, but as thoughtful, responsi
ble, and humane people, everyone ought to at least
think about these questions," she added.
