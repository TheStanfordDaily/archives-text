### MATT McQUINN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I he Stanford women's golf
team continued its consistent play
this weekend on the links, carding
a sixth place finish at the NCAA
West Regional Championships in
Tempe, Arizona. This finish ad
vances the team to the NCAA
Championships held in Sun River,
Ore., on May 24.
1 he Regional Championship
boasted the strongest competition
that the Cardinal lias yet to face. In
addition to conference-rivals No. 1
Arizona, No. 3 USC and No. 4 Ari
zona State, the West Regionals
showcased 21 other teams, includ
ing No. (> New Mexico State and
No. 8 Pepperdine. The top 11 of
the field will move on to finish
their season in Oregon.
Despite the stiff competition,
the No. 7 Stanford team was able
to fire three consecutive sub-300
daily totals.
After the first day of competi
tion the Cardinal was in third,
three strokes oil the lead.
The Cardinal Fired similar
scores the next two days to finish
with a total of 893, but still only
good enough to finish seventeen
strokes finish behind the victor,
Arizona.
"We played much better than
we scored," said junior Stephanie
Keever. "We were really consistent
and did not have any high scores,
but didn't make as may birdies as
we usually do."
The team has not finished
lower than seventh all season. Still,

the C Cardinal has yet to win a tour
nament. However, it has experi
enced the taste of several near
wins, including a second-place fin
ish at the Pac-1() Conference
Championships on April 2(). The
team feels that it is due to come out
on top.
"I think that we are going to do
well at nationals," said junior Hi
lary Homeyer. "Everyone's going
into next week playing well."
Overall, the Regional tourna
ment was Stanford's most consis
tent performance. Besides a 79 on
the last day, the Cardinal's tabu
lated scores ranged between 72
and 75.
All team members placed well
individually. Keever and senior
JaeJean Ro led the Cardinal, fin
ishing in a tie for 21st, followed by
Homeyer (27th), freshman Kim
Rowton (34th) and junior Salimah
Mussani (65th).
The team looks for this consis
tency to be an advantage at nation
als on the Cross Water Course in
Oregon, a course that requires
consistent shots to shoot low
scores.
Stanford also considers its ex
perience to be a valuable attribute.
For the past two years, the team
has placed eighth in nationals,
aided by the play of stars 1 lomeyer
and Keever. In addition, all but
Mussani, a winter transfer student
from the University of Texas,
played the NCAA Championship
Course in the Fall Preview last Sep
tember.
Head coach Caroline O'Con
nor looks to channel such past ex
perience into another impressive
finish at Nationals.
"We're really excited and we
have been practicing really hard,"
said Mussani. "Hopefully it'll all
pay off in Oregon."
