# Men's track team, Jennings dominate the 1,500-meter race
## Gabe Jennings notched an Olympic qualifying time this weekend 
### BEN ALLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The excitement at Friday
night's Cardinal Qualifier was less
about the night's performances
and more about anticipation.
Everything seems to be coming to
a head for the Stanford men.
The atmosphere the Cardinal
created Friday was one of a team
on the brink of something big. And
though the Pacific 10 Conference
championships lie only a week
away in Eugene, Ore., the antici
pation was NCAA, maybe even
Olympic Trials caliber.
Performances were sharp, espe
cially in the 1,500-meter run.
Having missed an Olympic
Trials qualifying mark (3 min
utes, 36.8 seconds) just one week
before by half a second, redshirt
sophomore Gabe Jennings threw
his name in the hat again as one
of America's top Olympic
prospects.
Amped by a bleacher-filling
band of finis beating drums and
tambourines, Jennings went all out
from the gun. Jennings was rabbit
ted by Sammy Langat of Puma and
Jennings hit extremely fast splits
through 1000 meters. Then, he
was let go to fend for himself.

Jennings gapped the field by at
least three seconds but struggled
through a last-lap kick and fin
ished at 3:38.7, the second best
time run by an American this year.
Only his mark from last week is
better.
The Cardinal's most promising
results in that race, however, came
from redshirt sophomore
Jonathon Riley and freshman
Andy Powell.
Riley posted his quickest 1,500
of the year at 3:42.5, and Powell
did likewise at 3:43.1. Both are
provisional qualifying marks for
the NCAA meet.
Even the Brad Hauser, normal
ly found only in races from 3,000
meters up, posted a solid effort at
3:45.1. Currently redshirting
freshman Seth Hejny was clocked
..I 3:46.4.
In the (SOO meters, junior Ryan
Carroll and sophomore Mark Has
sel captured season bests at 1:4 ( .).3
and 1:50.7, respectively.
But other than those marks, the
night was quiet for the
Cardinal. More conspicuous were
the likes of juniors Thomas Murley
and Michael Stembcr, locks for the
NCAA meet, dressed in street
clothes and biding their time until
the championships season comes
along.
Pac-lOs, contested May 20 and
21, will be the first outdoor cham
pionship meet of the year fort lit'
Cardinal. And head coach Vin
Lananna promises to treat it as

just that.
"At Pac-l()s, we won't worry
about qualifying anybody for any
thing," Lananna said. "We're
going to treat that meet as an end
in itself."
