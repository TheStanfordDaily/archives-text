# New curriculum tracks planned in Comm Dept
## 
### CHRIS DRAKE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For better or for worse, curricu
lum changes are coming to Stan
ford's Communication Depart
ment. While some believe the new
curriculum will effectively achieve
the department's goals, others are
less satisfied with the department's
new offerings.
According to Kristine SainuH
son, chair of the Communication
Department, the department ap
proved a new set of academic
"tracks" last June lor its majors to
pursue.
"A lot of thought and energy
went into creating these tracks, so
that students wouldn't have to
reinvent the wheel,'' Samuelson
said. The tracks enable Communi
cation majors to take a more inter
disciplinary approach to the field.
They are recommended, but not
required.
The Communication Depart
ment has created three tracks stu
dents can follow after fulfilling the
major's core requirements. The

lii.si, Communication Technolo
gies. includes courses in computer
science and science, technology
and society. The second. Commu
nication and Public Affairs, allows
Communication majors (o branch
out into political science, psycholo
gy and public policy courses. Fi
nally, the Media Practices and Per
formance track includes only
Communication courses, al
though it provides a broad per
spective on film .ind journalism.
Despite the new opportunities
that have opened up for ('.ommu
nication majors, a few of the most
popular courses in the depart
ment will be eliminated next year.
One course on this list is Comm
136/236, Broadcast Journalism.
The decision to discontinue this
course has met with some disap
proval, because the class takes a
hands-on approach to its material.
"People going into communica
tions have to have knowledge in
broadcasting, image-making [still
and motion pictures], writing and
Internet. 1 his is a class that inte
grates all of those things," said
Larry Benskv, a visiting prolessor
who has taught the course since
1992.
"1 was told that the curriculum
was being redesigned. 1 loundthat
very pu/./ling because the class has
been extremely popular. |l was
puzzled that] the University, with
so many resources, would phase
out such a class," lk-nskv said.
"Over the years, I've had at least
twice as many students apply as I
can take (in the course]," he said.
Some students are dismayed
that the Communication curricu
lum no longer includes as many
hands-on courses.
"Students can definitely get ex
posure, but now [they'll] have to
go out and get it on their own,"
said Selin Song, a sophomore

(Communication major. "It would
be nice to see the University offer
opportunities [to students]
through their classes," she added.
Song said she wished there
were more practical c lasses to bal
ance the theoretical ones. "I [see]
valuable insights in the theory, but
I don't think anything can substi
tute for the ac tual experience and
practice." she said.
Samuelson said she thinks the
Communication major lias never
been more practical.
"Stanford's not ;i trade school,"
Samuelson s;iid. She noted that a
number ol opportunities exist at
Stanford to give Communication
majors experience in the field, in
cluding SCBN, the Stanford Film
Society, The Stanford Daily,
KZSU Radio and the depart
ment's internship program,
which enables Communication
majors to perform internships for
credit.
"We're trying to create theoret
ical frameworks as the media

changes around us," Samuelson
said. "You can't understand any
aspect of communication without
the theoretical framework," she
said.
"1 do think it's terribly impor
tant lor students to get practical
experience. It's incredibly impor
tant .. . but I don't think that's
our job in the C Communication de
partment," she said.
Not all students feel that the
(lommunication department is
moving in the wrong direction.
"My perception is that [the
(lommunication department] has
ac tually become a lot more practi
cally oriented, though the tracks,"
said senior Communication major
Hannah Coldie, who serves as a
(Communication peer adviser.
"Like every social science here,
[Communication] has a theoretical
background," (ioldie said. "If you
see the way we've structured the
tracks, the major is actually a lot
more practical than it's ever been
before."
