### CHRIS DRAKE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For better or for worse, curricu

ford's Communication Depart
ment. While some believe the new
curriculum will effectively achieve
the department's goals, others are
less satisfied with the department's

nally, the Media Practices and Per
formance track includes only
Communication courses, al
though it provides a broad per

that have opened up for ('.ommu
nication majors, a few of the most
popular courses in the depart
ment will be eliminated next year.
One course on this list is Comm

course has met with some disap
proval, because the class takes a
hands-on approach to its material.

broadcasting, image-making [still
and motion pictures], writing and
