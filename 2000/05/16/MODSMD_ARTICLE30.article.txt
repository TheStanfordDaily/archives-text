# No. 2 baseball outhits USF in 12-6 slug-fest
## Next, the Cardinal plays to avenge its loss to U. of Nevada 
### TIM KANE STAFF WRITER 
Perhaps on Sunday afternoon,
when no one was looking, some
one moved Coots Field to the
I lilltop campus of the University
of San Francisco — minus the
rear-seat (upholders and goofy
pseudo-waterfalls.
As anyone in attendance at
Monda\ "s game on between No. 2
Stanford and USF could attest,
Henedetli Diamond did a pretty
fair impression ol the notorious of
fense-inflating hallyard on a
( loud) Monday afternoon in the
(:it\. ,is the Stanford baseball team
bashed out a 12-(> victory over the
Dons in a non-conference slugfest.
Admittedlv, the fact that
liencdetti Diamond happens to
be the approximate size of a band
box probabh contributed to the
onslaught of runs Monday —
there were at least two line-drive
hoineruns that surely would have
been doubles in a normal-sized
park like Sunken Diamond.
Regardless of the size of the
park, Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess seemed pleased with
the result, as the team inarches
down the road leading to the Col
lege World Series.
"We're playing alright — I
think we're pretty consistent," said
Marquess following the game.
" Fhe good thing now is if one guy

isn't doing it, the somebody picks
ns up, and it's been a different guy
each time. The bottom half of the
lineup has helped us when the
middle hasn't done much."
In USF's final game of the sea
son, the middle did plenty, in par
ticular senior centerfielder Ed
mund Mutli. Muth went 3-for-6
with four runs batted in, three of
which came on a mammoth blast
over the right field fence that
landed somewhere on Masonic
Avenue, which runs right behind
the field.
"He's had a great year for us,"
said Marquess of Muth. "I'm real
pleased with him. and that's what
he wanted, to comeback his senior
year and have a big year."
Junior righthander Justin
Wayne, the Cardinal's resident
ace during the '00 season, started
the game and went the first three
innings for his 11th win, giving up
only one run and 3 hits in three in
nings of work, apparently regain
ing the solid form which made
him dominant in the early part of
the season.
Unfortunately, Brian Sager,
working his way back into form
after shoulder trouble, was didn't
perform nearly as well, as the
sophomore was shelled for 5 runs
and 7 hits in only 2 2/3 innings.
Marquess, for one, preferred to
look on the bright side.
"We didn't help him a lot, by
making a couple errors behind
him. 1 It- got behind a little bit, and
had to pump in a fastball, and so
most of the pitches they hit were
