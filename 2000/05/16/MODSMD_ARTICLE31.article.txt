Ever wondered what kind ol
chisel marks are present on
Michelangelo's "David"? Well, art
historians have. And flying back and
forth to Florence can get expensive.

In six months to a year, the
method of obtaining this
type of data will c hange for
ever. Thanks to Computer
Science Prof. Marc Levoy's
Michelangelo Project, 3-D
models of "David" and other
statues by Michelangelo will
soon be available to re
searchers all over the world.
Description of project
During Levoy's sabbatical
year from 1998 to 1999, he
led a team of faculty, gradu
ate students and undergrad
uate students to Italy to

begin the project. There, they
scanned many statues, including
"David" and began the process of
converting them into 3-1) computet
models. At its peak, the team con
sisted of 30 faculty, stall and stu
dents at Stanford and the Universi
ty of Washington.
Gaining sole access to the muse
ums was not an easy task. Levoy

spent two years negotiating with the
museums before going <>n the trip.
The unique perspective the team
gained by having access to the statue
was invaluable. The team made
some illuminating discoveries as a
result of their perspe ive. The pro
ject corrected the history books by

noting that the "David" is actually
almost 3 feet taller than previously
thought (17 feet rather than 14 feet
3 inches).
Procedure
l he process of converting the
statues into models includes scan
ning the statue wit ha rangefinder to

determine the shape, taking many
digital photos to determine the
color and combining the gathered
data to create the final !5D model.
Scanning with the rangefinder
The rangefinder consists of a

laser and a digital video camera.
The rangefinder shoots a laser
stripe at the target to be scanned
and the light is reflected by the tar
get. The video camera views the
contour of the stripe. This contour
is then converted to a set of 3-1)
points that reflect the shape of the
target.
The rangefinder is affixed to a

pan-tilt head on an arm, which is at
tached to a town that sits atop a
movable gantry. I he rangefinder
points the lasei towards the object
and the distance i* recorded as de
scribed above. It continues this
process from one position while
slowly making a nodding motion.

The rangefinder also sweeps up to
90 degrees from left to right to
record overlapping scans. I lie scan
ner can move forwards and back
wards four feet 011 the arm and the
arm can move up and down eight
feet on the tower. Aftei the statue is
completely scanned from one posi
tion, the gantry is rolled to a differ
ent position around the statue, and

the process begins again. A re
searcher programs this motion into
the rangefinder, and then the
rangefinder moves In itself.
A common problem with the
rangefinder is that the target does
not alwavs reflect .ill the light from

the laser stripe. In some cases, some
of the light penetrates the surface of
(lie target and so the brightest spot
is actually behind the surface of the
object. This process is called scatter
ing. Specifically, marble tends to
scatter some light. Also, parts of the
marble are too dark to reflect the
laser light. To account for these
problems, all the distances recorded

fora specific spot on the David are
averaged together to get the dis
tance that will be reflected in the
computer model.
Another problem is that the
rangefinder moves automatically
and can therefore hit the statue it

not well-attended. Sometimes
the rangefinder has to be
positioned very close to the
statue to record every nook
and-crannv in the statue. To
make sure the rangefinder
does not hit the statue,
someone watches its move
ments at all times with
his her linger on the red
"Kmergency Stop" button.
I he rangefinder also has
padding attached to it to
make sure that if the statue
is hit, no damage will be
clone.
No statue has ever been
daaged, and to the best of
I.even's knowledge, the

rangefinder lias never come into
contact with a statue.
Adding color
A digital camera is used to deter
mine the color of the object. The

Computer Science Prof. Marc Levoy's Digital Michelangelo Project produced a computer rendering of Michelangelo's unfin
ishea statue of St. Matthew (detail of cheek above) in its first attempt to catalog the famous artist's sculptures as 3-D digital
images. The project members use a laser scanner (right) mounted on a moveable armature to scan the various statues.
