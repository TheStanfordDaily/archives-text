Ever wondered what kind ol
chisel marks are present on
Michelangelo's "David"? Well, art
historians have. And flying back and
forth to Florence can get expensive.

In six months to a year, the
method of obtaining this
type of data will c hange for
ever. Thanks to Computer
Science Prof. Marc Levoy's
Michelangelo Project, 3-D
models of "David" and other
statues by Michelangelo will
soon be available to re
searchers all over the world.
Description of project
During Levoy's sabbatical
year from 1998 to 1999, he
led a team of faculty, gradu
ate students and undergrad
uate students to Italy to

begin the project. There, they
scanned many statues, including
"David" and began the process of
converting them into 3-1) computet
models. At its peak, the team con
sisted of 30 faculty, stall and stu
dents at Stanford and the Universi
ty of Washington.
Gaining sole access to the muse
ums was not an easy task. Levoy

spent two years negotiating with the
museums before going <>n the trip.
The unique perspective the team
gained by having access to the statue
was invaluable. The team made
some illuminating discoveries as a
result of their perspe ive. The pro
ject corrected the history books by

noting that the "David" is actually
almost 3 feet taller than previously
thought (17 feet rather than 14 feet
3 inches).
Procedure
l he process of converting the
statues into models includes scan
ning the statue wit ha rangefinder to

determine the shape, taking many
digital photos to determine the
color and combining the gathered
data to create the final !5D model.
Scanning with the rangefinder
The rangefinder consists of a

laser and a digital video camera.
The rangefinder shoots a laser
stripe at the target to be scanned
and the light is reflected by the tar
get. The video camera views the
contour of the stripe. This contour
is then converted to a set of 3-1)
points that reflect the shape of the
target.
The rangefinder is affixed to a

pan-tilt head on an arm, which is at
tached to a town that sits atop a
movable gantry. I he rangefinder
points the lasei towards the object
and the distance i* recorded as de
scribed above. It continues this
process from one position while
slowly making a nodding motion.

The rangefinder also sweeps up to
90 degrees from left to right to
record overlapping scans. I lie scan
ner can move forwards and back
wards four feet 011 the arm and the
arm can move up and down eight
feet on the tower. Aftei the statue is
completely scanned from one posi
tion, the gantry is rolled to a differ
ent position around the statue, and

the process begins again. A re
searcher programs this motion into
the rangefinder, and then the
rangefinder moves In itself.
A common problem with the
rangefinder is that the target does
not alwavs reflect .ill the light from

the laser stripe. In some cases, some
of the light penetrates the surface of
(lie target and so the brightest spot
is actually behind the surface of the
object. This process is called scatter
ing. Specifically, marble tends to
scatter some light. Also, parts of the
marble are too dark to reflect the
laser light. To account for these
problems, all the distances recorded

fora specific spot on the David are
averaged together to get the dis
tance that will be reflected in the
computer model.
Another problem is that the
rangefinder moves automatically
and can therefore hit the statue it

not well-attended. Sometimes
the rangefinder has to be
positioned very close to the
statue to record every nook
and-crannv in the statue. To
make sure the rangefinder
does not hit the statue,
someone watches its move
ments at all times with
his her linger on the red
"Kmergency Stop" button.
I he rangefinder also has
padding attached to it to
make sure that if the statue
is hit, no damage will be
clone.
No statue has ever been
daaged, and to the best of
I.even's knowledge, the

rangefinder lias never come into
contact with a statue.
Adding color
A digital camera is used to deter
mine the color of the object. The
digital camera is attached to the

Computer Science Prof. Marc Levoy's Digital Michelangelo Project produced a computer rendering of Michelangelo's unfin
ishea statue of St. Matthew (detail of cheek above) in its first attempt to catalog the famous artist's sculptures as 3-D digital
images. The project members use a laser scanner (right) mounted on a moveable armature to scan the various statues.


same structure as the rangefinder.
The scans are shot on the same
setup of t|ie gantry, but the scans
are taken separately from the dis
tance measurements. While the
laser measurements are taken
with a moving rangefinder, the
digital camera scans are taken
when the rangefinder is still.
Two scans of every spot are
taken —112 one with ambient lighting
and one with a spotlight and am
bient lighting. Researchers then
take the difference between the
colors jof the two scans to deter
mine (he color of the spot with
only aispotlight. The effect of the
spotlight can then be subtracted
out to get the true color of the
spot. I
Artificial lighting can be placed
on tl»e final computer model to see
what) the statues would look like
undfr different lighting condi
tions.
Creating a 3-D model
In order to create a three-di
mensional model, the distance
measurements fora certain sec
tion of the statue are placed into
th/b correct position with relation
to the whole statue. Later, opera
tors try to overlap the scans with
neighboring scans. The data set is
then fed into the computer, where
the computer tries to fully fit the
icans together.
Every point on the statue has
three coordinates, and the shape
connecting any three points in
space is a triangle. When the
pieces are fully placed together,
the model resembles a lot ol trian
gles fit together, also known as a

triangular mesh.
The last step is to place color on
the model by melding the color
data set with the rangefinder data
set.
Converting the distance mea
surements to a 3-1) model is a long
and labor-intensive process. The
group has spent 4,000 man-hours
on this part of the project and is
still working on it. Currently, the
group has achieved a 2 mm reso
lution model of the David, but its
goal is to achieve a.25 mm resolu
tion model. This would be the
same resolution as the laser mea
surements.
Issues
One of the problems with such
an exact rendering of statues is
that few people have the resources
to view it. fhe computer model of
the David has 2 billion polygons,
and 7,000 images. It occupies 32
CB on a computer's hard drive.
Oraduate student Matt Cint
zon, who has worked extensively
on the project, does not see this as
a major problem, for two reasons.
First of all, the Michelangelo pro
ject has a deal with the Italian mu
seums to restrict the models strict
ly to "scientific researchers."
Therefore, most people using tlie
models would have state of the art
computers. Secondly, through a
process called decimation, the
model can be simplified. Decima
tion involves converting the vast
number of small triangles in the
model into a larger number of big
ger triangles.
Another possible problem that
could arise is the issue of piracy.
To ensure the integrity of the dig
ital models, there has been talk of
producing a three-dimensional
digital watermark to make sure
the models aren't copied.

Levoy said lie wanted to "dis
tribute as widely as possible," as
long as the models did not become
commercial.
Future projects
Using this scanning method,
members of the project have
scanned 10 statues, two building
interiors and 1,163 map frag
ments. The project's first scan was
Michelangelo's "St. Matthew."
One of the projects currently in
the works, the Forma Urbis
Romae, is along different lines
than the others. The Forma Urbis
Romae is a giant marble map of
ancient Rome which, when it was
complete, measured 60 feet
across, 45 feet high, and was
carved onto marble slabs several
inch thick before it was shattered.
Many historians have tried to
piece together the map fragments
to no avail. By scanning the frag
ments and letting the computer
assemble the puzzle pieces, the
team hopes to succeed where oth
ers have failed.
Levoy sees many places in
which the procedures could have
been improved, including having
a better scanner and a better cali
bration system, but he also said
that another similar project was
not in the works. He said his gen
eral research principle was to
"prototype the project, relate
lessons that we learned, and then
leave it for someone else."
Levoy mentioned some future
projects that could yield interest
ing results: creating digital li
braries and archives, making a
computer database that lasts 500
years, distributing images, cata
loging images and searching tor
images. He also mentioned the
possibility of a shape or image
guided web.
