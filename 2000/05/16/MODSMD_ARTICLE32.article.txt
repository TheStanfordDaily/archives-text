## 'Father of birth control' looks back on forty years of contraception

A look at human reproduction through

si, "Father of the Birth Control fill," gives
lisa glance ;it not only drug development
and evolution, but also at his fascinating
predictions for the future of contraception
and conception.
While newspapers across the nation
touted the 40th birthday of the birth con
trol pill last week, marking its FDA approval
on May 9, 1960, Djerassi remarks that this
date is neither the scientific nor clinical
birthda) of the pill.
" 1 he true birthday would be when the
steroid contraceptive was first synthesized
in the laboraton on October 15, 1951,"
Djerassi states.
I he major evolutionary step the pill has
taken since it was first released is the dosage
of steroid hormones it contains, fhe origi
nal birth control pill released in the 1960s
had about five times the dosage of estrogen
and ten times the progestin that it contains
today.
Djerassi explains that the methods for
establishing dosages of new drugs for dif

ferent intended uses can lead to erring ei
ther on the high or low side of dosage level.
"Establishing a drug dosage can be ac
complished in two ways," Djerassi said. "For
anti-infection drugs, [researchers] start
with a low dosage then increase it to find the
effective level. For contraceptives, we had to
start with a dosage we would be certain
would be effective and then go down from
there."
Djerassi adds that because abortion was
still illegal in the 1950s and 19605, it was im
portant that the birth control pill released
to the public was fullv eflective.
" Fhe idea was to be absolutel) certain
that the woman would not get pregnant,"
Djerassi said.
Another difficulty encountered in estab
lishing the dosage level of the contraceptive
was finding an appropriate test animal.
" I he problem was that reproduction isa
species-specific behavior," Djerassi said.
"For drug toxicity, rodents and dogs are
the usual models, but thev are bad models
for human reproduction because the fe
males are on different cycles. I lie best
model is primates, but the\ are very expen
sive."

With llit' release <>l the pill into the mar
ket, I ears about blood clots, heart attacks,
and stroke prompted further research into
side rllcc'ts and the drop in dosage to the
current safer and effective level.
Now, forty years later as the long-term
effects ol the pill become clear, tlu.- pill is
mote identified with its positive side effects
ol decreased risk in developing anemia,
pelvic inflammatory disease and cancer of
the uterus and ovaries.
Today, approximately 10.7 million
women use the pill making it the most com
mon form of birth control used b\ women
ranked after sterilization.
Djerassi believes that sterilization will be
come even more common in the future as
wider availability of assisted reproductive
techniques will sharpen the division be
tween sexual acti\ itv and reproduction.
"I predict that the- use of contraception
bv the wealthv will diminish," Djerassi
states. "Among married couples todav, al
ready in ;i() percent of couples, one partnei
is sterilized either because thev do not w ant
children at all or thev do n< >; want am more
children."
Because women are born with a supply

of eggs that depletes as she ages while males
continue to produce sperm into adulthood,
taking advantage of the technology avail
able today that allows people to store their
gametes max make practical sense.
"Because females are born with a set
number of eggs that die oil as the woman
ages. In age forty, 90 percent of a female's
eggs that she started out with are dead,"
1 )jerassi said.
On the other hand, Djerassi contrasts,
"For males, testes also age, but not as cjnick
l\. A forty to fifty year old man is still com
pletely fertile."
"From a pureK biological standpoint,
fora Stanford student that wants to have
children later, she is better oil storing eggs
in her earlv 20s at her reproductive peak,"

said Djerassi. "But a 40 year old uterus is
still good for incubation."
As Djerassi realized that the tremendous
social implications of his scientific discoyery,
he began to address through fictional liter
ature the conflict in today's society between
technological breakthroughs and the ethi
cal dilemmas they precipitate.
He has now shifted his locus to creating
"science-in-fiction" works that fuse infor
mation about new biomedical technology
with the scientists' personal struggles which
are usually undocumented in scientific
journals.
Mis works of science-in-fiction include
his recent play "An Immaculate Misconcep
tion,'' which deals with the ethics of intracy
toplasmic sperm injection technology.
