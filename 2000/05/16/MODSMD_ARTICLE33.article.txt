# Chinese Hospital cultivates Bay Area cultural sensitivity
## 
### JACKIE WONG 
As different c uhurcs have been
gaining recognition throughout
America, cultural sensitivit\ lias
become an important concern.
Especially within the healthcare
sector, Nvliere a patient's hack
ground and beliefs have a large
impact on the success ol treat
ment, cultural sensitivit) plays a
vital part in the quality of care.
Without this sensitivity, main
problems such as non-compli
ance, patient dissatisfaction,
physician dissatisfaction and inef
fective treatment may result.
()ften times because of'the cul
tural differences between physi
cian and patient, misunderstand
ings nun lead to non-compliance
and dissatisfaction. 1 "his arises
most frequently when a patient
does not speak English.
I n an article entitled "Transla
tion is Not Enough-Interpreting
in a Medical Setting," Linda
Haffiier explores the difficulty of
language barriers within medi
cine. She gives examples of'Span
ish-speaing patients who tail to
comply with physician's orders
siniph because they did not un
derstand the instructions.
I liese misunderstandings

arise from the impropci transla
tion of medical instructions. Doc -
tors with limited knowledge of
Spanish may translate phrases lit
erally from English to Spanish
when the same phrase in English
may mean something slighth or
significantly different in Spanish.
This difference may have major
consequences within the medical
setting.
Haflncr's article expresses the
need to have professional transla
tors within the medical profession
in order to avoid these common
misunderstandings.
C hinese Hospital, located in
(lie heart of San Francisco's Chi
natown has been eflectivch pro
viding these bilingual services for
over seventx vears. While many
hospitals have just begun to real
ize the importance of cultural
sensitivity, Chinese Hospital has
gained national prominence in its
efforts to improve the health of
the (ihinese in America.
During this 70-year period,
(Chinese I fospital founded a ('.hi
nese Community Health flan,
developed the Asian-l'acilic Is
lander 1 fealth Fo.'um and hosted
a biennial international scientific
conference sponsored b\ eleven
Chinese American physician or

ganizations.
11l rough the Chinese Com
munity Health Plan, Chinese
I lospital has been able to address
the economic needs of its sur
rounding community. Since
many patients work in small busi
nesses that do not provide health
coverage, Chinese Community
Health Plan gives these workers
the benefit of health insurance.
II lis plan gives patients access to
most coinmunitx phvsicians that
speak their native language as
well as to Chinese Hospital that
provides bilingual services.
I lie extraordinary success
that (Chinese I lospital has gained
through its culturally sensitive
practices is a great encourage
ment lor the future of healthcare.
Although it ma\ not be possible to
institute an entire hospital dedi
cated lor every different ethnicity.
the services that ( hinese I lospital
provides can be implemented
into the existing hospitals
throughout the nation.
I lie ac hievements ol Chinese
Hospital and other healthcare
providers that have addressed
the needs of our diverse popula
tion steer the U.S. health care sys
tem towards effective, high-quali
ty care.
