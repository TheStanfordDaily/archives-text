# Tough advice for workaholics

### MARGAUX SNIDER 
()K, so it'll me if this scone is fa
miliar to you. "Western civiliza
tion has begun to move ..." your
professor is lecturing on the
thrilling world of western civiliza
tion or some other semi-useless in
formation. All of a sudden he is in
terrupted bv a hacking cough that
sounds like sandpaper or a sneeze
which could have come from an
escaped elephant in the back of
the room.
Not familiar? How about vou
go over to a 112 riend's room to w< >rk
on a weekly problem set. You are
about to go over w hat exactly hap
pened in question number five,
because as iar as you know that
question somehow defies the nat
ural laws ol die universe. and she
sneezes all over your work.
Being the conscientious stud\
partner that you are, after wiping
oil your soggy problem set, vou
ask why she isn't in bed or resting
since she is obviously sic k. She in
fbrms you she can't rest; she has
two papers and .1 midterm tomor
row to work 011, she's just going to
"work through it."
Does this phrase sound la mil iar
to vou? Well il it doesn't, you real

ly need to get out beyond the
FroSoCo, or whatever other cave
you've been in for the last two
quarters.
Most of us can sympathize with
the study partner; we understand
the deadlines that don't stop be
cause you're sic k. And many of us
have been the hacking, sneezing
people in the back of the room at
one time or another. But this
'Stanford Student' idea of "work
ing through it," — gimme a break.
It doesn't work. Colds and the
flu are rampant around the cam
pus especially because we run
around infecting our I-hum and
historv classes (not to mention
stuc 1 \ partners). (iolcls and the flu
are both viruses, so antibiotics
aren't going to help — there real
ly isn't any sort of quick 112 ix.
I here are the new flu medi
cines like Relenza, but tliev re
quire vou to get theni within the
first IS hours of the flu, and since
the\ require a prescription, they
necessitate a trip to Cowell within
two clavs of getting sick.
Does am Stanford student go
to the doc tor this soon?
Nope, because we're "working
through it." right? Well, in reality,
you need to rest fora couple of
da\s w hen vou get the cold, and a
week or two with the llu. You need
to drink fluids (2 quarts a clay!)
and can take some aspirin or
fvlenol.
Working through a cold or llu
can sometimes lead to complica

tions like bronchitis or even pneu
monia. Now I know we all have
that one friend that has been sick
for nearly two quarters but still
hasn't gone to Cowell or another
doctor, because they are too busy.
But, if your cold lasts for more
than 10 clays, and if you get a fever
for more than or 4 days, experts
say you should ask a doctor about
it. Cowell's medical services is
open Monday through Friday 9-5.
If vou're sick as a dog vou should
be able to find an hour to go talk to
someone, or find a friend to drag
you over if vou're too sick to bike.
If this whole talk about colds
and the flu is making you para
noid about germs, here are a few
prevention tips. If vou are wor
ried about getting the flu right be
fore finals or graduation, vou can
go to Cowell's Allergv and Immu
nization ( linic fora flu shot. (Just
call 4-CARK to make an appoint
ment.)
Fven more simplv. the lesson
your grandma taught vou wax
back when: wash \oui hands!
(Mien. FspecialK when vour stucl\
partner has just sneezed on vou.
