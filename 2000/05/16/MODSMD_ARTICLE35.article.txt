## Overseas student finds Japan to be a big fish in the cellular pond 
### 
Before I left for Japan, a good friend
informed me of a disturbing turn
of events. With a mixture of dis
gust and helpless resignation for the
coming of the new world order, he told
me how the syllabus for his Chinese class
included the explicit demand that all cell
phones and pagers be turned off for the
duration of the class. What is the world
coming to, indeed.
Well, not really. 1 guess 1 really come
from the other side of the tra( ks, having
long since come to appreciate (no, I am
not dependent) the convenience of being
able to call from my car, get my e-mails in
stantly, check movie times while waiting
in line at Safeway (wait, I did say 1 wasn't
dependent already, right? 1 just like to
take advantage of existing technology.
Imagine the shock, then, of coming to
Japan and realizing that all this time I've
been splashing around in the wading
pool while the whole of Japan (and Eu
rope, I've heard) has been scuba diving
off the deep end for some time now.

You'd wonder
why, until you
saw these tight
examples of
Japanese engi
neering and de
sign genius.

If my friend thought that cell phones
were becoming ominously Ã¼biquitous at
Stanford, he'd think that Japan came
straight out of a Twilight Zone episode.
It seems as though the percentage of peo
ple here with cell phones easily exceeds
that of people at Stanford with bikes.

their American counterparts, with ten
times the functionality packed into de
signs that elicit words like "elegant,"
"clean," "holy #@!$, where did you get
that?" and after a moment though, "why
the, hell is America still lugging around
these ugly bricks for phones whose IR
ports aren't even real?"
The base models, the ones that are
given away for free, have pretty standard

services such as e-mail, sky-mail (instant
messaging between phones for about 1
cent per message), ringer-song composi
tion capability, account usage records,
and of course, web browsing. Recently,
phones have started to sport color LCD
displays which can send and receive ani
mated images along with messages. The
better phones costa whopping 3,000 yen,
or about $30. These have all of the above,
plus little bonuses like calendar planners,
games, and the like. Some phones dou
ble as film cameras, some as digital c am
eras, or a database of maps. Perhaps the
coolest thing I've seen is a phone whose
flip-down cover actually doubles as a
PCMCIA card, turning the phone into a
64 kbps cellular modem. I his phone
might cost $40 to $(50.
While it's an undeniable fact that the
phones here are technologically more ad
vanced, it's harder to determine whether
the usage plans are better than the ones
offered in the States. Americans are used
to cellular phone plans t hat provide a c er
tain amount of "free" minutes fora fixed
monthly rate, and paying an additional
per minute charge for extra air time.
In Japan, there is a much greater vari
ety of usage plans perhaps because they
are so widespread that the industry has
incentive to cater to several demographic

groups, each with different cellular usage
habits. The most common type of plan
consists of a fixed monthly rate that in
cludes little or no "free" minutes; instead,
all outgoing calls are charged a per
minute rate. However, all incoming calls
are free, regardless of length. (This
seems to encourage the annoying but
money-saving practice of calling some
one else's keitui, hanging up before they
answer, and wait for them to call back.
Really tacky, but pretty common.)
This being the case, most people opt to
communicate via Sky Mail, a standard in
stant messaging service that are some
times compatible across different carri
ers. It does seem a hassle to have to type
in characters at a much slower rate, but
Japanese seems to be a slightly more com
pact language than English, further facil
itating Sky Mail usage.
Best of all, Sky Mails usually cost one
to two cents to send, and nothing to re
ceive. Most carriers also provide a near
ly free (one dollar a month) e-mail ad
dress that is linked to your phone. As for
why this technology isn't already in wide
spread use in the U.S., I still haven't fig
ured it out. I have heard that cell sites in
Japan are much closer together, result
ing in more space onboard the phone it
sell to add additional features, resulting

in a much lighter and more powerful
package. More interesting are the possi
ble social causes. For all the modern con
veniences that America seemed to pio
neer in days gone by, Japan seems for
more willing to try new things and adapt
to technological advances. For instance,
the MI) (minidisc) has become the stan
dard for music media, with everyone
from students to corporate salarymen
sporting the newest model on the sub
way. Toilets here might have a heated
seat, a built in bidet, and a dryer for af
terwards.
Japanese people have accepted cellu
lar technology with the same ease of tran
sition, while people in America are as yet
still bemoaning the passing of the good
ol' days when you kept a dime in your
shoe to make emergency phone calls
with. As for me, 1 think I've adapted well
to Japanese society, insofar as technology
goes. 1 just don't know how I'm going to
cope with going back to the Stone Age in
the fall.
