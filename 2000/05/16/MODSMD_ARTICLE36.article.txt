# Metallica's attack on Napster ineffective
## 
### 
After heai ing Sisqo's " I lit- I hong Song" repeated
multiple times on the radio and MP.'i, my philos
ophy was relleeted h\ the title of one of the former
l)ru I fill star's other hits.

1 just "C»ot to gel it.
Unfortunately, my
quest for more songs by
the undoubtedly natural
blond led me lo a dead
end. My only near success
was downloading part <>l
"(lot to get it"from Nap
ster. Altei I realized my
newly downloaded song
was only hall * omplete, 1
tried to sign back onto
Napster to nab the rest of
it.
Five seconds later, 1 let
out a phrase that (an only

be repeated on KZSI if'you're willing tc • p.iv $500 to the
F(X]. So I'll clean it up for printing purposes.
Metallica sucks.
After many days of talking smack in the- news, Metal
lica had finally succeeded in ending my musical tree
reign. Napstei had given Metallica the keys to my In
ternet castle, and they locked ii up light.
Napstei is an Internet sen ice thai allows users to sign

on and trade songs. Napster searches through specified
directories for MPHs and when a user signs off, and,
when the user signs off, the list disappears along with
him.
Napster, as most heebie-loving, Tl-toting college
students know by now, is the biggest advancement in
connecting free music to fans since Ernst F. W. Alexan
derson invented the radio in 190(5.
Of course, the biggest difference between Alexan
derson's device and Napster is that artists' don't give
permission lot their songs to appear on Napster.
I lading MP'Vs online is a lot like stealing the Spice
(channel from your neighborhood < able provider. I he
product becomes free, pleasure is gained and, as long as
you're not doing anything stupid, nobody gets hurt.
Napster has long claimed that it was not responsible
for regulating the MPMs traded through its service, since
they did not actually provide the illegal MP.'Js. Accord
ing to them, it was its massive user base that was re
sponsible.
I his alibi has always served as more of an excuse than
an actual governing principle, however. Napster
bragged about how, using its service, you didn't have to
dig through loads of unknown artists to gel lo the pop
ular ones. ()f course, almost no popular artists give per
mission for their MP3s to be traded, so most of the pop
ular music on Napstei is pirated. Napster pulled their
pitch-line when radio executives cried foul. I asked Li/

Brooks, Napster's Vice President of Marketing, who
should be responsible for trading illegal MP.'is through
its service, Napster or a trader of illegal music like me.
She gave me a "You. Sorry. Don't take it personally!
She gave me a smiley-face! (I'mon, you know Napster's
not taking the law seriously.
So that's why I like Napster. They share my values.
First on my list is saving money. Don't try to separate a
clesi from his money. That's my advice to you — just
don't. See what happens. So, returning from our public
service announcement, we come to second on the list.
It's music. H I could have just one thing with me on a de
serted island, it would be my collection of MP'is. |ust
don't tell my girlfriend I said that.
Where are ethics on my list, you ask? A distant tenth.
I know my right from my wrong but, quite frankly, I just
don't care.
Big budget bands worry 'bout big bucks. That's the
cardinal rule of thumb. Metallica knows that, besides
money, nothing else matters. 1 know copyright law is
important. That's why I never copied a copyrighted
course leader in Green when copying was free. Yup,
never.
I kept using Napster even though my N C -B hard
drive is overflowing with over 1500 MP3s. The conver
sation had gone back and forth fora while — what was
going on was clearly mainstream and illegal, but Nap
ster itself was tough to blame and there were to many

users to take them all to court.
So Metallic ;! did the next best tiling. 1 hey submitted
a list of 335,435 users who traded pirated Metallica
Ml'3s. 317,000 users, including me, were then banned
from Napster for ten days or until Metallica presses
charges. Metallica lias always been a fan-friendly band,
but they felt they had to step up.
According to James Hetfielcl, lead singer and lead
guitar, on the Metallica Web site, "The list ... is hope
fully just to show the world and artists how huge this is
ancl how important, and hopefully other artists will join
our light." or course, a large part of the motivation be
hind the lawsuit probably lies with the fact that album
sales have diminished, but it was a bold move regardless.
The list was primarily to draw attention to the piracy
problem. In that vein, it was a success. The number,
over 300,000 users trading illegal Metallica songs alone,
is staggering. I he list did not actually successfully ban
many people fiom the service, however. There are
many ways to reregister with the service and, if no action
is taken against the users in ten days, which Metallica has
no intention of doing, the users will be reinstated any
way.
So I reregistered. Like most college students, I like
music but don't have a lot of money. So I'm taking some
money from rich artists that don't need it. So I like to
think of myself as a modern-age Robin flood — steal
from the rich, give to me. So sue me.
