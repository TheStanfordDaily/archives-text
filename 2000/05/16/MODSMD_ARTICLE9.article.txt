Nike renews contract with
U. Michigan for one year
Nike Inc. has agreed to extend by one year its licens
ing agreement with the University of Michigan, and
Michigan will buy uniforms and equipment from Nike
for the next academic year.
The agreement, announced on Friday, comes two
weeks after Nike had abruptly called off talks on renew
ing a contract to provide money, footwear, and apparel to
all 25 of Michigan men's and women's varsity athletics
teams, saying the university had made unreasonable de
mands just as the contrac I was about to be finalized. Nike
had said at the time that Michigan was asking it to comply
with labor standards and human lights policies that it
found "potentially disruptive."
Michigan has conditionally joined the Worker Rights
Consortium, a student- and labor-led organization that
Nike opposes, saying that its proposed methods of moni
toring corporate conduct are unrealistic.
The intei im one-year contrac I apparently has nothing
to clo with a change of heart, but everything to do with lo
gistics. Michigan had already placed an order with Nike
(or equipment and apparel lor the next year on the as
sumption that the c urrent contract, which expires in Au
gust, would be renewed.
"Coaches were panicked about what their athletes
were going to wear," said Joel Seguine, a university
spokesman
