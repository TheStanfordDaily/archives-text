1973
The May 3 edition of the 1973 I>aily
contained a front-page article with the
headline: "35 picketers protest I*hi Delt
stripper raffle."
ITie story reads, "About 35 demonstra
tors picketed the Phi Delta Ilieta house
yesterday afternoon and argued for over
an hour with fraternity members about a
house party two weeks ago where a strip
per was raffled off.
Hie Phi Belts are currently under in
vestigation by the University as well as the
California Alcoholic Beverage Commission
due to a result of the party.
Hie demonstrators, mostly women, car
ried picket signs and a banner reading:
'Public Sale Of Human Beings; Lowest
Form Of Degradation' while they chanted
'two-four-six-eight, try Phi Delt and sell
your date.'
They arrived at the house shortly before
5 a.m. and didn't leave until after 6 p.m.
There was no violence during the demon
stration, although tempers ran hot at
times."
The Bottom Line: Some things never change.
