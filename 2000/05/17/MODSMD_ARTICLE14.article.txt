About !J5,000 people from towns neat

town, in recent clavs, fearing renewed

workers sav. Mans have found shelter
with friends and relatives, hut others have
ended up here, at the National Worksta

"We are afraid," says Ramatu Bangu
ra, sitting surrounded l>\ her live i liil
dren and the lew possessions she man
aged to grab when gunshots rang out last
week near her last home, a camp just out
side Freetown. "Four times the rebels
came to nn place. 1 hey burned tin

When the\ found his bodv, I only tecog
ni/ed him by the clothes."
Like Bangui a, many here have been
forced to flee time and again over eight
years of civil war during which rebels
have killed tens of thousands and
maimed many more men, women and
children in a campaign of terror.
Long abandoned l>\ its former British
owner, the disused railway station filled
with squatters when the rebel Revolution
ary United Front invaded Freetown in
January 1999, burning, looting, maiming
and killing thousands. Soon alter, organi
zations such as the World Food Program,
UNICIFF and Doctors Without Borders
began distributing food, building latrines

and installing a c lean watei supply.
Conditions here are grim. Hundreds
crowd into a Ibrniei hangar-like work
shop. Strips of canvas and plastic sheeting
stretched between dustv. rusting equip
ment demarcate the dwellings ol each
lamilv and provide some shelter from the
watei that drips down through c racks in
the soaring ceiling.

clutching old rice bags and plastic con

finding the camp alreach lull with
7,000 residents, the !i.0()0 new arrivals
have been forced to shelter wherever
the) can — in the food distribution cen
ter, the school tent, oi an alley between
I wo buildings.
Asked il thev want to leave, however,
most shake then heads emphaticall\.
"No, no, no," says Sain Biango, whose
15-year-old daughter was locked into her
family's home and burned alive In the
rebels, who also hacked oil the hands of
his two brothers. "I am afraid lor my
other children."
Last July, the rebels signed a peace
deal giving their leaders top government
posts and amnestv lor the atrocities they
committed. 1 .N. peacekeepers deploved
throughout the counirv, and war-wcar\
civilians started to move bat k to tlieii vil
lages.

Hut ihe rebels tore at the accord b\
taking peacekeepers hostage. I hen, a
week ago, thev opened lire on thousands
of demonstrators outside rebel chief
Focla\ Sankoh's home. Fhit teen c ivilians
and six soldiers were killed.
"I was not expecting such." sa\s linda
Sukudu, who returned last year from
neighlx>ring (.1 tinea, w here she fled after
the Rl F'attacked her village and forced
hci brother to hold their father's head as
rebels slit his throat. "I was feeling fine. 1

thought peace had come to Sierra
Leone."
With armed government troops once
again manning checkpoints along the
main road linking the seaside capital to
the interior, some of those who fled last
week to Freetown are alread) heading
back to their former camps and towns.
But many have lost confidence that
peace will be restored and refuse to leave
the relative security ol the capital.
"1 am old now. I can't be running all

the time," says lsata Sheriff, who stood in
line with about a do/en recent arrivals
jostling to be registered so they can
receive food and other assistance.
Hunched over with age, she wipes
tears from her eyes with the edge of her
chess as she remembers her husband
shot bv the rebels, the weeks spent wan
dering through the forest with her five
children and her daughter lost when a
burst of gunfire sent the family running
in different directions.
