## 
### 
IX)S ANCELKS (AP) — Vet
eran guard Ron Harper
believes the Los Angeles Lakers
lack the killer instinct that the
championship teams led by
Michael Jordan Hashed with
regularity. Coach Phil Jackson
said his players have a difficult
time taking responsibility when
things go wrong.
And this is a potential cham
pion? "1 think so. that's win I'm
here. I hat's why we're all si ill
here, I think.'" I larper said.
The Lakers won an NBA
high f>7 games during the regu
lar season to establish them
selves as solid favorites to win
their first title since 1988, but
needed the maximum five
games to eliminate Sacramento
in the first round.
" This team lias realh grown
a lot, I think, this vear." Jackson
said. Los Angeles crushed
Phoenix in (lame I of the West
ern Conference semifinals
before winning close decisions
in the second and third games
to take a 3-0 lead in the best-ol
scven series. But the Lakers
were embarrassed 1 17-98 Sun
day, forcing a fifth game last
night at Staples (Center.
Wesley |ackson was so put
oui during the game, he had ln
tle to sav to his team ai I).illume
or afterward, and spent some
10 seconds addressing the
media without taking questions.
I he coach was philosophical
24 hours later. "It's better off
left unsaid sometimes." lie
explained. "In a cooler
moment, when you've had a
chance to analyze some things,
you tan come across with rea
son. It's embarrassing enough,
you don't have to give them a
tongue-lashing."
file Lakers trailed 71-48 at
halftime and didn't pose a
threat after that.
"It's important for us to
learn lessons as a basketball
team," Jackson said. "Lacli les
son that is handed to us, we've
got to accept willingh.

"Every individual on our
team had lapses. We were total
ly prepared for everything that
happened. We have to take
responsibility. I bis is a ballclub
that has a lot of trouble saying,
'My fault, mea culpa."
Jackson emphasized that
despite the ugliness of Sunday's
game, the Lakers accomplished •
what they wanted in Phoenix —
a split. A win would put them in
the conference finals against
Portland or I tab.
I'm not that disappointed;
we had to plav a game between
now and Saturday, Jackson
said, referring to the earliest the
conference finals will start. "I
expect a totally different effort."
About a killer instinct, Jack
son said, "1 don't even consider
killer instinct, fhat has nothing
to do with it. Ii lias to do with
the present, letting tilings go,
plaving from this moment on.
When you can't instill that in
nine months, that's the disap
pointing thing.'"
Harper, the onh Los Ange
les plaver who spoke with the
media Monday, said the Lakers
aren't ncarh as good as they
think thev are. and the Bulls'
championship teams would
have beaten the Suns in (lame 4
"In 200 points."
"Mad, upset, sad, sorry we
had to be here todav. sorry we
had to see this film today," the
3(>year-olcl veteran said when
asked the mood of the team.
"But since the sun did rise up,
we're all fine."
Harper said he probably
hadn't seen Jackson so upset in
a postseason setting.
"He had the right to be
licked oil. I larper said. "I told
the gii\ s.it halftime. 'We should
all be embarrassed, 71 points. "
Should Phoenix score an
upset — the Lakers are 10-
point favorites — a sixth game
will be in Phoenix tomorrow
night. \ seventh game, if need
ed, will be at Staples Center on
S.it urday.
