# Counter-culture activist speaks
## Ram Dass encourages merging activism and spirituality 
### KATHERINE LEMONS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Rani Dass, a prominent icon of
1960s counter-culture, addressed
an audience of 250 at the Ananda
Church of Self Realization in Palo
Alto Tuesday night, speaking about
merging activism and spirituality.
Dass spoke in a flow of words in
terspersed with long pauses, the re
sult of a recent stroke which left his
right side paralyzed and his ability
to grasp his words impaired.
Dass, formerly Richard .Viper,
who received a Ph.D. in psychology
at Stanford in the early 1960s be
fore joining the Harvard Psycholo
gy Department, told the predomi
nantly middle-aged audience
sprinkled with students that, "I am
having a personal experience. I bis
whole area has for me associations
with my doctoral thesis and me
teaching at this university. 1 have
gotten some chills around here."
In 1963 Dass was dismissed from
I larvard after joining with his col
league Timothy Leary in distribut
ing LSD to his students while ex
perimenting with the use of psy
chedelic drugs as tools for expand
ing the realm of consciousness.
Forty years later. Dass has re
turned to the world of students with
Sat Santokh. a yoga teacher, to pre
sent their initiative which they call
"Creating C )ur Future."
The mission statement of "Cre
ating Our Future" is to "train stu
dents in how to work together ef
fectively for social and environmen
tal change from a spiritual perspec
tive."
After leaving Harvard, Alper
made a spiritual journey to India
where he explored consciousness
through meditation and returned
as Baba Ram Dass.
Upon his arrival in the United
States, he wrote the counter-cul
ture classic "Be 11 ere Now" and
rapidly rose to prominence among
alternative and activist young peo
l)le"
In the wake of the recent \\ 1 O
protests in Seattle, Dass and San
tokh hope to show young activists
how to combine their social justice
work with a deep sense of spiritual
ity.
Five instrumentalists opened
the evening, singing several San
skrit songs. After the music and
Santokh's brief welcome, Dass
spoke for a full hour.
Alternately serious and light, his
words repeatedly caused the atten
tive and sympathetic audience to
dissolve into long periods of laugh
ter.
"There are ways which perform
social action ... There are ways
with compassion," Dass said, delv
ing into the heart of his message.
"In the sixties we bifurcated," he
said. "I was the spiritual part of that
team. Many of my friends became

political activists around issues of
the Vietnam War, sexual freedom,
women's rights and pot."
At the world "pot," he and the
audience shared a knowing chuck
le.
He described the social activists
as angry at an "other" while he and
his more spiritually-minded friends
delved into self-exploration. Each
group, he said, felt that they were
"on the forefront." He grew to rec
ognize. he said, that the distinction
was a bad one and that the artifi
cially separated elements of action
and spirituality are mutually sup
porting.
Santokh, who identifies himself
as a representative of the activist
camp in which he has been in
volved since the 19505, began his
part of the presentation by leading
the assembled group in a medita
tion and a series of breathing exer
cises. He then traced the path of his
involvement in activism and his
spiritual journey.
"1 thought the purpose of spiri
tual practice was to become a better
activist," he said.
He gradually came to feel that
"any action that was not done from
this heartfi.il space was not worth
anything."
While the two have ultimately
ended up feeling the importance of
integrating action and spirituality,
Santokh said that he hopes to
"teach people how to do social ac
tion from a place of spirituality,"
and Dass that "I do social action to
deepen my spiritual nature."
In the wake of his stroke, Dass
has continued to delve ever more
deeply into his own spirituality as
he has come to understand it as a
grace, allowing him to "prepare for
the next step of my soul."
Matt LePay, a junior, was among
the approximately 15 Stanford stu
dents who attended the event.
LePa\ first heard of Dass in high
school as lie explored the work of
the Beat generation.
"I heard of him as the spiritual
element of the Beat generation,"
LePav said.
After the event, LePay com
mented that "1 like the fact that he
is so down to earth and is an ap
proachable spiritual figure ... 1 re
ally enjoyed [the evening] with its
focus on spirituality and social ac
tivism."
Le Pay believes that the combi
nation is something that is increas
ingly present in the current gener
ation of college students but that
there must be a "push for people to
get involved with activism to incor
porate that loving kindness.
Following a question and an
swer session, the last word was
given by two Monterey musicians
who riled the remaining 75 audi
ence members up with the chorus,
"Let the good times roll!"
Santokh will lead a follow-up ses
sion for interested students on
Thursday at 7 p.m. at Synergy
House.
LePay plans to attend and pre
dicts that most of the students who
were at the church with him tonight
as well as others will join him.
