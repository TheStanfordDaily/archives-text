## The 						Stanford Daily Lower salaries for undergraduate TAs justified 
### 
There are lots of ways to make money
on this campus: work at the library
or the Coffee House, be a tour
guide, a lifeguard, etc. But one way
that may not spring to the minds of most
undergraduates is being a teaching assistant.
And perhaps this is because being a TA is
rarely a significant source of income for an
undergraduate. I* ul for many graduate stu
dents, teaching sections and grading exams
provides a major source of income. This isn't
just because graduate students spend more
time working for professors; graduate stu
dents are often paid significantly more than
undergraduates for working as a TA.

Graduate students will often have their
entire tuition, as well as room and board, for
given in return for being a TA. In addition, a
lot of TAs also receive a quarterly stipend.
Undergraduates, on the other hand, rarely
receive more than a small quarterly stipend
and usually only have the option of receiving
credit (no pay). And because a coterminal stu
dent is considered by the University to be a
graduate student, a fourth-year coterminal
student may receive several thousand dollars
more in compensation than a senior who is
TA-ing the same class.

should pay a higher price for something of
higher quality. So, while having a graduate stu
dent as a TA is no guarantee that section will
be a wonderful event, you are in most cases
paying for the additional years of education
and experience that a graduate student has
had. And many undergraduate students feel
more comfortable when being taught by some
one they don't feel is a peer, no matter how
qualified and intelligent that peer may be.
In addition, as an undergraduate, a student
is guaranteed on-campus housing. Graduate
students are given no such promises and are
often forced to deal with high Palo Alto rents.
They also have to pay for utilities, food, gas

and other necessities that students living on
campus take for granted. And considering that
the only income many graduate students have
comes from working as a lA, a lot relies on
that paycheck.
So, while undergraduates may feel slight
ed at their lower pay, the University
undoubtedly has good reason to structure
the pay scale the way they do. And there are
a lot of non-monetary perks that come from
working as a TA while one is an undergrad
uate: close relationships with professors, an
additional line on the resume and, of course,
that feeling of power over your peers, how
ever real it may be.
