### SCOTT DORFMAN UDARA FERNANDO STAFF WRITERS 
In what was possibly tlit* final meeting of
the year for the ASSU Senate — and the first
officially attended by the students elected to
be ASSU Senators for next year — senators
unanimously approved a new financial man
ager, allocated money to three new student
groups, and approved the Nomination Com
mittee's recommendations for university
committee members.
Colby McGavin, a senior, will assume the
post of ASSU financial manager beginning in
June.
"Colby has worked very hard with us on
this year's budget and will do a great job as the
new financial manager," said Sean Lucy,
Class of' 99, the present ASSU financial man
ager.
However, debate broke out over the ASSU
Operating Budget for next year, specifically a
provision providing $8,000 for the ASSU
president to allot to his cabinet.
While some senators believed the money
to be just compensation for cabinet members,

others believed the compensation was unnec
essary and that a cabinet would divide the
ASSU.
" There are plenty of people on campus
willing to work for students, and not for
money," said Senator Kristy Wilson, a senior.
"Plus, the more people you have in the cabi
net, the more a cabinet is almost 'your Senate'
to a President."
ASSU President-elect Seth Newton, a ju
nior, disagreed. "We need to pay people to
contribute the time to work around our is
sues," he said, citing the complex and ambi
tious nature of the programs proposed in his
campaign.
Senator Ashok Reddy,a senior, added that
allotting this money would create a stronger
sense of duty and responsibility in the cabinet.
Addressing these concerns, an amend
ment lo the budget giving the undergraduate
and graduate senates control over how the
$8,000 will be proportioned was proposed by
Senate members.
The amended budget was approved by the
