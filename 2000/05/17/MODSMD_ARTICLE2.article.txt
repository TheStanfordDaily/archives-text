# Senate takes care of final business
## 
### SCOTT DORFMAN UDARA FERNANDO STAFF WRITERS 
In what was possibly tlit* final meeting of
the year for the ASSU Senate — and the first
officially attended by the students elected to
be ASSU Senators for next year — senators
unanimously approved a new financial man
ager, allocated money to three new student
groups, and approved the Nomination Com
mittee's recommendations for university
committee members.
Colby McGavin, a senior, will assume the
post of ASSU financial manager beginning in
June.
"Colby has worked very hard with us on
this year's budget and will do a great job as the
new financial manager," said Sean Lucy,
Class of' 99, the present ASSU financial man
ager.
However, debate broke out over the ASSU
Operating Budget for next year, specifically a
provision providing $8,000 for the ASSU
president to allot to his cabinet.
While some senators believed the money
to be just compensation for cabinet members,

others believed the compensation was unnec
essary and that a cabinet would divide the
ASSU.
" There are plenty of people on campus
willing to work for students, and not for
money," said Senator Kristy Wilson, a senior.
"Plus, the more people you have in the cabi
net, the more a cabinet is almost 'your Senate'
to a President."
ASSU President-elect Seth Newton, a ju
nior, disagreed. "We need to pay people to
contribute the time to work around our is
sues," he said, citing the complex and ambi
tious nature of the programs proposed in his
campaign.
Senator Ashok Reddy,a senior, added that
allotting this money would create a stronger
sense of duty and responsibility in the cabinet.
Addressing these concerns, an amend
ment lo the budget giving the undergraduate
and graduate senates control over how the
$8,000 will be proportioned was proposed by
Senate members.
The amended budget was approved by the

Senate. Aronowitz stated that if the
amendment were contested in any
way by the GSC at its meeting
tonight, the Undergraduate Sen
ate will have to reconvene next
week to reach a compromise.
Three student groups to which
the Undergraduate Senate unani
mously voted to award funding
are: Stanford Students for Life, the
Stanford Objectivist Club and
Enigma magazine.
Stanford Students for Life re
ceived $70 from the ASSU for a
"Feminists for Tile College Plan
ning Kit" and a year's subscription
to "Pro-Life Magazine," according
to the group's budget proposal.
The Stanford Objectivist Club
received $530 for posters, speaker's
fees, and miscellaneous expenses.
Enigma magazine, published
once a year, received $2,875 from
the ASSU to cover printing expens
es.
In addition, the ASSU voted to
allocate Program Fund Reserve
money for the Roble Multi-Use
Performance Space, which will be
home to various performing arts
pre >ductions.
"Program Fund Reserve money

is money that the ASSU has in re
serves from groups that did not use
all of their all<x ated money in a cer
tain year," said Senate Chair Steven
Aronowitz.
"In the past, the money has
gone to large, one time only ex
penses, such as golf carts to 5-SU RE
and minivans for the Haas Center,"
he said. "We are saying with this
vote that the money will be there in
the future for Roble Theatre, but
the administration and the ASSU
will have to come together some
time with specific line items for how
exactly the money will be used for
that purpose."
The Undergraduate Senate also
voted to give bonuses to members
that served on its Election Commit
tee.
While some in the Senate feared
that this set a negative precedent
for the future Senate and the .ASSU
as a whole, proponents of the
bonuses cited the extra week of
work required of the Committee
due to the runoffbetween the pres
idential slates in this year's elec
tions.
Following a concluding proposi
tion by Senator-elect Jordan Con
nors, a freshman, to have an ASSU
freshman rally, and sentimental
closing remarks by several outgo
ing senators, Aronowitz adjourned
the meeting.
