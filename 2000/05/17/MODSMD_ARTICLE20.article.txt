# THERE IS NO SPOON
## The 						Dealer's Wisdom 
### 
Last weekend, I spent thai most
I lallmark of holidays — Moth
er's Day — in Las Vegas. Las
Vegas, after all, is a land of
dreams — a plate for all families. At
least that's what the National Airlines
Flyer magazine said on its front cover.
It was supposed to he a really big deal.
My sister called me weeks in advance
in order to arrange the surprise. (Not
that my mother was

surprised, but at least
she pretended.)
I would fly out
from SIX), while my
sister llew out from
Boston with her
"fiance" (long story.)
All this to commemo
rate the woman who
gave birth to us.
What better wav to

show our love, we thought, then with
Siegfried unci Roy and Cirque du
Soleil? (T» he honest, we didn't spring
lor Siegfried tickets. $K ( .)..'L r > a pop was
just too much lor smoke, mirrors and
two Fahio look-alikes.)
As with most of my family's gather
ings, the first day was .ill about love:
"Oh, I missed you too! Oh, do you
remember when . . .? Oh, I'm sooo
glad I'm filially meeting your — what
was that word again? 'fiance'."
liui by the third day, our old high
school patterns of behavior resurfaced,
and we all quickly reached our toler
ance level: "Oh. So when's your Might
again? Mom, I wish you wouldn't tell
that story in front of people. Mom,
he's not my friend; lie's my fiance!"
Don't get me wrong; we are a very
loving family. It's just that in my expe
rience, it's easier to love your family
when you're 30,000 miles apart. Look
ing around the Strip that Sunday
afternoon, I despaired that the inflight
magazine lied about Vegas, as I saw a
lot more dysfunctional than functional
families. (Yes, I realize that Las Vegas
Boulevard on Mother's Day isn't exact
ly a representative, statistical sam
phng.)
Kven putting underpaid, airline
copywriters aside, 1 still felt that we
might end this Mother's Day on a good
note if we could only allow the beauty
and majesty of Las Vegas to work its
magic. (Yes, I have been watching just
a wee bit too many Lifetime TV movies
lately.)
So it was with a hopeful heart that 1
sat down at the Luxor War table at 2
a.m. last Sunday.
I realize how pathetic that might

sound; so first, a few clarifications: 1) I
am not a gambler. But when you're
bored in Vegas at 2 a.m. and don't
want to be in your room, it's either the
casino floor or keno in the Pyramid
Cafe. 2) War is a valid casino game.
For those of you who don't remember
War, it's the card game you used to
play with that stupid kid down your
street. You'd each take half a deck and
reveal your cards one at a time. If you
had the higher card, you'd take your
cousin's — I mean, opponent's —
card. And the person with all the cards
left at the end won. Add a dollar bet
for each card, and you've pretty much
got the Vegas edition.
It's not like War is "my game." But
I didn't understand craps, I couldn't
place my bets fast enough for roulette,
and blackjack was just too expensive
for my blood.
I'm not even sure if War is a com
mon gambling game, but a friend who
recently went to Vegas said she played
it at another casino. Now, it wasn't
exactly my plan to get drunk, either,
but when you're winning at War, the
Luxor management likes to comp you
a couple of 112 ree drinks — around eight
or nine Long Island Ice leas.
Bv then, Sally the 'raspy,
chainsmoking, frosted white hair'
dealer and I had become good friends,
at least as good a friend as could be in
90 minutes and eight Long Islands.
I had just finished telling Sally
about the latest flare-up in my sister's
little Mother's Day extravaganza when
Sally, speaking with the wisdom of a
mother, told me: "Whatever. She's
your mom, hon."
Obvious when stated, but mothers
truly are, for the most part, forgiving
creatures. They don't blame you for
the If) hours in labor thing. Or the
thing you did to the rug in third
grade. Or that whole trying-to-sell
your-sister-to-a-pictu re-bride-catalog
fiasco.
And sometimes, as we all get
wrapped up in our drunken, Las
Vegas-style dreams, we lose sight of
that fact. I'm not claiming any epipha
nies among the neon-filled skies of
Nevada, but we all need a little
reminder from time to time. Even if it
has to come from a War dealer in the
middle of a casino at two in the morn
ing.
