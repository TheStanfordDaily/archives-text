Students react to MSAN display
1 am writing this letter in response to
the article "Banner causes controversy"
that ran in yesterday's Daily.
"Unknown persons removed the Mus
lim Students Awareness Network's ban
ner, which was put up after the date of
Israel's Anniversary."
Thanks first for the article that was fair
in conveying the picture. As a personal
opinion, I would say that nolxxly can be
hurt or injured when we state such facts.
These were just numbers telling the truth.
If someone is injured by displaying these
facts, then what could we say about the
people and the civilans who were killed
and those who were forced to flee their
own homes as well as their families. In fact,
those people never violated human rights
or U.N. resolutions. No one has the right
to stop Muslim Students Awareness Net
work from speaking for those people.

Several years ago, I initiated Arab-
Israeli collaboration at Stanford during my
time as president of the Organization of
Arab-American Students in Stanford
(OASIS). At that time, OASIS worked with
the Stanford Israel Alliance and Hillel to
present several events to bring together
the diverse Arab, Jewish and Muslim com
munities. We had high hopes for future
dialogue and understanding, however, the

comments and letters in yesterday's Daily
from (>al Raz and Justine Fisher have
shown that our early efforts for under
standing have failed.
I was really quite shocked when 1 read
Ra/'s comments about the Muslim Stu
dents Awareness Network s banner. Ra/
said that he was "very hurt and offended"
and continued by proclaiming that "this
stuff is not true ..." 1 challenge Raz to pre
sent evidence that any of the claims and
numbers presented by the MSAN are
false. In fact, each and every detail is sup
ported by volumes of historical data from
Palestinian and Israeli sources. Raz. also
fails to explain why he is "offended" by this
presentation of the the truth.
Later in the same issue, Raz proclaims
that he is on a "quest for peace." True
peace and justice cannot Ix- achieved with
out acknowledging past transgressions;
however, Raz embraces the typical pro-
Israeli position that Israel has done noth
ing wrong. By ignoring the killing of thou
sands of Palestinians and the dispossession
of hundreds of thousands of others, Raz
not only fails miserably in his "quest for
peace" but also manages to expand the
chasm separating Israelis and Palestinians.
Echoing Raz's denial of Israeli complic
ity in Palestinian suffering, Fisher claims
that the MSAN's display describes events
which "all happened within the context of
a war." Clearly, Fisher does not have
detailed knowledge of Israeli history
because she fails to understand that Pales
tinian suffering under Israeli oppression
was not limited to 1948; in fact, it contin

ues to this day as noted on the MSAN ban
ner.
Finally, 1 would like to ask both Rax and
Fisher how they feci about the efforts by
Jews to receive compensation from Ger
many and Swiss banks for the Holocaust.
If they agree that bygones should be
bygones, as they claim in their letters, and
that Jews should have no right to compen
sation or acknowledgement of wrongdo
ing by the Germans, then 1 commend
them for their consistency. However, il
they believe, as 1 do, that Jews who suf
fered din ing the Holocaust deserve com
pensation, they should re-examine their
denial of past Israeli atrocities towards
Palestinians.

The Muslim Students Awareness Net
work would like to thank all those who
have voiced their opinions about the "52
Years of Oppression" banner and exhibit
placed in White Plaza on Monday.
It is our hope that the display shed
more light on the matter and that dialogue
will continue to take place. MSAN is com
mitted to peace, but we realize that peace
can only be acheived through justice and
mutual respect. We hope the display con
tinues to promote dialogue, and we thank
the Stanford community for its over
whelming support.
