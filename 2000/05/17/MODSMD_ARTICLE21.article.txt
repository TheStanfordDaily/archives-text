Students react to MSAN display
1 am writing this letter in response to
the article "Banner causes controversy"
that ran in yesterday's Daily.
"Unknown persons removed the Mus
lim Students Awareness Network's ban
ner, which was put up after the date of
Israel's Anniversary."
Thanks first for the article that was fair
in conveying the picture. As a personal
opinion, I would say that nolxxly can be
hurt or injured when we state such facts.
These were just numbers telling the truth.
If someone is injured by displaying these
facts, then what could we say about the
people and the civilans who were killed
and those who were forced to flee their
own homes as well as their families. In fact,
those people never violated human rights
or U.N. resolutions. No one has the right
to stop Muslim Students Awareness Net
work from speaking for those people.

Several years ago, I initiated Arab-
Israeli collaboration at Stanford during my
time as president of the Organization of
Arab-American Students in Stanford
(OASIS). At that time, OASIS worked with
the Stanford Israel Alliance and Hillel to
present several events to bring together
the diverse Arab, Jewish and Muslim com
munities. We had high hopes for future
dialogue and understanding, however, the

comments and letters in yesterday's Daily
from (>al Raz and Justine Fisher have
shown that our early efforts for under
standing have failed.
I was really quite shocked when 1 read
Ra/'s comments about the Muslim Stu
dents Awareness Network s banner. Ra/
said that he was "very hurt and offended"
and continued by proclaiming that "this
stuff is not true ..." 1 challenge Raz to pre
sent evidence that any of the claims and
numbers presented by the MSAN are
false. In fact, each and every detail is sup
ported by volumes of historical data from
Palestinian and Israeli sources. Raz. also
fails to explain why he is "offended" by this
presentation of the the truth.
Later in the same issue, Raz proclaims
that he is on a "quest for peace." True
peace and justice cannot Ix- achieved with
out acknowledging past transgressions;
however, Raz embraces the typical pro-
Israeli position that Israel has done noth
ing wrong. By ignoring the killing of thou
sands of Palestinians and the dispossession
of hundreds of thousands of others, Raz
not only fails miserably in his "quest for
peace" but also manages to expand the
chasm separating Israelis and Palestinians.
Echoing Raz's denial of Israeli complic
ity in Palestinian suffering, Fisher claims
that the MSAN's display describes events
which "all happened within the context of
a war." Clearly, Fisher does not have
detailed knowledge of Israeli history
because she fails to understand that Pales
tinian suffering under Israeli oppression
was not limited to 1948; in fact, it contin

ues to this day as noted on the MSAN ban
ner.
Finally, 1 would like to ask both Rax and
Fisher how they feci about the efforts by
Jews to receive compensation from Ger
many and Swiss banks for the Holocaust.
If they agree that bygones should be
bygones, as they claim in their letters, and
that Jews should have no right to compen
sation or acknowledgement of wrongdo
ing by the Germans, then 1 commend
them for their consistency. However, il
they believe, as 1 do, that Jews who suf
fered din ing the Holocaust deserve com
pensation, they should re-examine their
denial of past Israeli atrocities towards
Palestinians.

The Muslim Students Awareness Net
work would like to thank all those who
have voiced their opinions about the "52
Years of Oppression" banner and exhibit
placed in White Plaza on Monday.
It is our hope that the display shed
more light on the matter and that dialogue
will continue to take place. MSAN is com
mitted to peace, but we realize that peace
can only be acheived through justice and
mutual respect. We hope the display con
tinues to promote dialogue, and we thank
the Stanford community for its over
whelming support.

MUSLIM STUDEN T'S AWARENESS
NETWORK
On Tuesday, the president of
the Israeli Student Organization
and Justine Fisher expressed
through letters to The Daily their
dissatisfaction with Monday's
exhibit in White Plaza. In response
to Mr. Raz and Ms. Fisher's reser
vations, 1 would like to clarify the
motives for calling attention to the
numerous massacres of Palestini
an refugees.
Mr. Raz argues that making
such facts known is detrimental to
"walking along a path to peace"
and "efforts to break down walls
rather than building new ones."
Ms. Fisher echoes a similar tone,
citing that "it is more constructive
to focus on a peaceful future than
to harp on a past."
Their assertion that a path
towards peace is mutually exclu
sive of acknowledging past (and
present) oppression is very trou
bling, to say the least. Writing oil
massacres of innocent refugees as
"an inevitable consequence of
war" is untenable. Such indolence
has been extremely detrimental to
the peace process.
In my opinion, bringing such
atrocities to light only underscores
the imminent need for fervent
involvement in the peace process.
MSAN embodies such a vision, as
evidenced by their active partici
pation in the Jewish-Arab-Muslim
dialogue cited by Raz. It is untor

tunate that some — be they the
individuals who vandalized the
exhibit, Mr. Raz or Ms. Fisher —
may disagree with such a vision.
Pei haps it would be more con
structive if their frustration over
standing up for the oppressed is
channeled toward acknowledg
ment and remorse over the atroc
ities cited in the exhibit.

Extolling Exotic Erotic
At lunch on Monday, while try
ing to piece together events from
Saturday night, I was dismayed to
find no coverage of Stanford's sig
nature saturnalia: Exotic Erotic. I
was hoping for pictures of gyrat
ing naked bodies, stories about
shameless indulgence in pleasures
ol the flesh and quotes from boozy
students. Maybe what I really
wanted was someone to fill in the
112 orgotten moments of my frenzied
evening.
Probably why The Daily didn't
run an article on Exotic Erotic is
that I've already summed up the
party. Exotic Erotic is just another
fraternity-type party with a twist:
people are encouraged to stretch
the limits of social taboo and show
a little skin. But Exotic Erotic is
not a random party: it's a Stan
ford tradition.
Unfortunately, traditions are
not stable at this University. Cur
rent sophomores don't realize
that this party has happened
before, because last year there was
no Exotic Erotic; and current
freshmen may think that this is an
original idea. The collective Uni

versity mind has a short memory.
It a party is not held for even one
year, there is a strong possibility
that it will never be held again, 110
matter what its reputation might
have been.
Some history, for those in the
dark: Alpha Sig, a house in the
Cowell Cluster now occupied by a
sorority, used to host Exotic Erot
ic. Alpha Sig had incredible char
acter (and parties) consistently
from year to year. The adminis
tration made a brilliant move in
getting rid of Alpha Sig: they kept
an unhoused fraternity from get
ting a house, the) kept the Creek
community at bay, and they got
rid of a pernicious self-op (i.e. a
house where too much fun was
had). An ancillary benefit was the
destruction of Exotic Erotic, a
point that surely influenced the
Office of Residential Education's
decision.
As evidence, note that Roble
wanted to have a party called
"Pimps and Hoes" this year, and
was forced by the administration
to change the name to "Flashy
Trash," since the former name
could potentially promote deviant
behavior. Clearly, Exotic Erotic
pushes the boundaries of "accept
able" much further than the
innocuous "Pimps and 1 loes," but
the administration is, thankfully,
powerless against Stanford tradi
tion.
1 can sympathize with reasons
why people would be opposed to
Exotic Erotic. I couldn't find
even one friend to go with me.
My senior friends all thought
that I was just indulging in
sophomoric revelry, far above
their status. Others 1 talked to
were uncomfortable with getting

naked, disgusted at the thought
of the gender ratio and con
cerned with alcohol-influenced
hormones.
What was forgotten was the
SPIRIT of the dance. The flesh is
certainly willing, but we are weak
in that we have trouble abandon
ing social convention, because in
that uncharted realm, we must
find a new source of morality.
We've been fed moral platitudes
all our life without justification:
"Alcohol should not be used as a
social lubricant," "Your body is
yours and should not be violated,"
"Only freaks wear leather."
Res Ed fears that if these con
ventions were to be lost, then
chaos would ensue in the dorms.
Let all ye moral conservatives take
this party as an example: social
convention has a purpose in pro
moting stability and productivity,
but do not necessarily lead to
moral destruction and an eventu
al collapse of society. Having fun
is not a sin. Only by rationally
questioning our Puritanical beliefs
can we come to a true under
standing of the foundations of
morality.
Exotic Erotic isn't just about
sex. It's about going wild and
about doing naughty things en
masse. It's about getting your ass
grabbed by a stranger. It's about
drinking excessively. It's about
striking up a
chat with a woman dressed as a
dominatrix. It's about carnal frit

lion on iht* dance floor. It's about
sex in tlie bathroom when people
are waiting. It's about the Tree's
exposed boobies. It's about your
friend's dangling penis. It's about
willingly accepting your decadent
fate, whatever that might be.
Okay, maybe that all adds up to
some form of sex, but it isn't dan
gerous deviant behavior, as some
would like to have you believe.
This year, it's too late to partici
pate in the degenerate excess of
Exotic Erotic, but I encourage you
to question socially imposed
norms and to gather empirical
evidence. And who knows? You
might have fun in the process. I
definitely do.
