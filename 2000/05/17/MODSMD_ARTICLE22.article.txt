### MINAYO NASIALI 
Blue skies and calm waters greeted Cardinal
crew at Sunday's Pacific 10 Championships in Ran
cho Cordova, California. As the day progressed,
however, the men's and women's varsity, junior
varsity, and novice teams faced increasingly stormy
conditions.
Although unfavorable weather could have po
tentially affected Stanford's performance, tfie
men's varsity eight raced a successful fourth place
in the grand final. The women's varsity team fin
ished ninth overall, after placing third in the petite
final.
The men's and women's teams faced stiff com
petition as they challenged five of the top teams
from the Pac-10, including women's No. 1 ranked
Washington, and men's No. 1 California and No. 3
Washington.
At last year's Pac-10 championships, the Cardi
nal finished fourth in the grand final of the men's

varsity eight as they did this year. However, the
women are down one, finishing third in the petite
final where they finished in second place last year.
Men's varsity qualified for the grand final by
placing second after Oregon in the preliminary
heat on Sunday morning. Later that afternoon, the
Cardinal crossed the finish line of the 2000-meter
course with a time of 5:53.5, after Cal (5:35.5),
Washington (5:40.7), and Oregon State (5:46.3).
"1 was satisfied with the varsity performance,"
said men's head coach Wieslaw kujda. "They have
improved since last year's Pac-10s by showing more
speed. However, all the Pac-10 teams have im
proved since last year and 1 was pleased to compete
well against the number one crew in the country."
Women's varsity eight finished behind USC and
Oregon State in the morning's preliminary heats.
Advancing to the petite final, the Cardinal raced
the 2000-meter in 6:56.2 to finish third after UC
