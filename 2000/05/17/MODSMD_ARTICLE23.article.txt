### BROOKE MORRILL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As early as age six, cotenninal
student Steve Kleha could be
found spending endless summer
days sailing at his home in Newport
Beach, Calif. Now, as a veteran
member of the Stanford sailing
team, he looks toward two national
competitions this spring on the
E4st Coast with his crew senior
Katie Gregg.
Sailing was an essential part of
Kleha's youth. I fe was surrounded
by|yachting, boats, yacht clubs and
sailors. Gregg found her love l<>r
the sport at a summer camp in
North Carolina where she eventu
ally ran the sailing program for
girls.
"My family belongs to New I lar
bor Yacht Club which prided itself
on its strong youth sailing pro
gram," Kleha said. "It got us com
peting by the time we were six or
seven and it earned bragging
rights in southern California when

we did well."
Competing extensively
throughout his youth earned
Kleha a strong reputation in the
sailing world as he approached col
lege. He was recruited by Stan
ford's head coach Steve Bourdow
as well as the team at Georgetown
and Harvard.
"I based my college decision on
the strength of each one's sailing
team. But I'm also a Califbrnian at
heart and knew that 1 wanted to
stay on the West Coast. After I was
accepted by Stanford, it wasn't re
ally a tough choice."
While at Stanford, Kleha has
been an active member of the team
for four years. He had an instru
mental role in the 1997 season
when the team won the team rac
ing National championship.
"Winning that year was fantas
tic, lhe title, coupled with the close
c amaraderie of the six sailors that
traveled together for the team rac

Gregg have been a dynamic duo this sailing season,
leading the Cardinal to two national competitions.
ing regattas, was the highlight ol
iny Stanford career," Kleha said.
kleha teamed up with Cregg
this January to begin what lie
called the most productive
months of sailing he has ever ex
perienced.
"I can not believe how last we've
come to understand each other on
and oil the water," Kleha said. "We
are really innovative as a team,
we've learned new maneuvers, we
are constantly experimenting and
testing ourselves lor boat speed
and are continually focused on ac
complishing our goals."
Ac cording to (-regg. the duo set
their goals in February to qualify
for team racing nationals as well as
coed fleet racing nationals. They
accomplished their first goal at the
beginning of April by beating UC-
Santa Barbara and Hawaii in the
team racing qualifier. Then two
weeks ago, they met their second
goal by c linching the second place
spot in the coed fleet racing qualifi
er along-side senior Tyler Doyle

and junior I leathet Porter.
"We talk about goals .ill the
time, for one partii ulai practice, a
regatta or the season as a whole,"
Ciregg said. " I lie goals that we
made in February at one point
seemed like a stretch, but now that
we achieved them, we are pushing
even harder."
Klcha and Gregg have two
weeks to prepare with the team for
the two national competitions.
Stanford's team racing team will
consist of klcha and (uegg, Doyle
and Porter and seniors Anika
Leerssen and Alexis Krivkovich.
"I know we have the ability to
finish in t he lop three, Klcha said.
"We've already beat the top team
in the nation, USC, and managed
to really challenge St. Mary's and
the Naval -Academy at the Stan lord
leant Racing regatta this year."
The fleet racing competition fol
lows the team racing regatta in
early June. Klcha feels that Stan
lord has the potential to be among
the top live teams if lie* sails at his
capability and if Doyle sails like he
did during the I'CC qualifier in
Santa Barbara.
Regardless of the outcomes of
kleha's final regattas, he plans to

stav closclv tied to the Stanlbrd
team after he leaves 1 he Fanfi. I le
will be working at Cambridge Asso
ciates on I'age Mill Road and hopes
to help coach in whatever capacity
p< )ssible.
(iregg is also leaving the team
after four years of commitment
and competition. She is heading to
sub-Saharan Africa where she will a
part o! the I'eacedorps for the next
two years.
"it's really great to be sailing
with someone else who is ending
their Stanford career. We know
this is our last chance and we are re
ally pushing hard to meet our linal
goal. We want to go out yvith a
bang," (iregg said.
I he Kleha/(iregg teant 'has
been a leader on the water and has
been a great contribution to the
Stanford team. The extensive
amount of time they spend togeth
er has had high rewards in compe
tition and in their friendship.
"When you spend that; itwich
time together on a little boat: Von
have to be able to laugh and have a
good time together. We are luckv
that we can combine that with high
aspirations lor our sailing and Jujep
each other on track," (ireggsaid.
