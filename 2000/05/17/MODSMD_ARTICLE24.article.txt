# It's out of our hands
## 
### 
It'sdeja vu all over again. 1 lore we arc, in
a mortal race to the finish in the I'ac ilic
10 Conference. The schizophrenic but
timely Cardinal is tied in the standings
against an unlikely opponent, who's ridden
a high-powered offense to heights no one
expected before the season.
Thanks to a heartbreaking loss earlier
this season, we can't finish tied with them in
the standings — they've got all the tiebreak
ers.
And here we are, watching them play a
cream puff, facing a tough rival ourselves,
hoping only that our enemy's enemy can be
our friend and play the spoiler. ()ur fate is
out of our hands, but all we need is one
chance.
I lello, football season.
I lello, baseball season.
You two have more in common than you
think.
I he Stanford baseball team is locked in a
old-fashioned, no-holds-barred, barbecl
wire-on-the-boxing-gloves-style pennant
race coining into the last weekend of the
season with perennial contender I CLA
and 2000 upstart Arizona State. VSI and
the Cardinal sit at 15-6 in the conference, a
game behind UCLA at 10-5.
And for once, the schedules worked out
— UCLA and Stanford finish the season
against each other, in a battle to the death

for the soul of the Pac-10.
Just like they draw it up
back in 11 oily wood.
What makes this
weekend less of a straight
good-vs-evil ac tion mov ie
and more of a psyt holog
ical, I sual Suspects-t\ pe
thriller is, of course, the
Sun Devils, the spring-

time version ol Washington in the football
season. Arizona State was pic ked to finish
sixth in the conference before the vear start
ed. but they've ridden a breakout offensive
season to prominence and a No. 3 national
ranking.
And as Stanford faces a tough UCLA
lineup and a Bruin team that's fighting for
national recognition and a postseason life,
Arizona Slate saunters off to face their puta
tive rival, Arizona, a team that earlier this
season they beat 9-7, 14-Sand — are you
ready for this — .'l2-3.
Friends, this is when the bookies start to
give each other knowing glances and
scratch out betting slips colored red and
gold.
Hut it it were that easy, the Washington
football team would have been liv ing large
in I'asadena New Year's Eve this year, in-

the conference in I\RA and runs

in opponents' hailing average and

I he ( at dinal belter hope so, at

And dial's what the ( animal
season rests on — collegiate base

Iron) the- Sun Devils with the
league title at stake are about the
same as their chances ol winning

It's a funny sort of pennant
race — the Cardinal's own series
looks almost antic limac tic by com

All Stanford has to do, after all.
is what it wanted to do all along:
pit< li well, swing the hats, and win
some games. II they do that,

there's nothing to do about them
but hope lor a repeat of the loot

By Friday night, Stanford'll
know il it has its destiin in its own
hands or not. We're down to the
wire; there's nothing lo be done
now but wait and see . . .

fell ('.< viper, a junior, would like to
