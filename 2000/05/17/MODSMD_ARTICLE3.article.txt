### JESS DANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Author Vikram Seth, invited to speak by the Stan
ford Creative Writing Program and Gerhard Casper,
who is a htn and admirer, talked about and read from
his new novel last night in (lubberly Auditorium.
Seth, born in India in 1952, attended Stanford as a
graduate student in economics. It was din ing this time
that he discovered his writing abilities, lie was hon
ored with the Wallace Stegner Fellowship in Creative
Writing here from 1977-78.
Seth has published three novels: "A Suitable Boy,"
" The Golden Gate" and, most recently, "An Equal
Music." He opened tonight's talk reading excerpts
from"The Golden Gate," which was inspired by his
time at Stanford.
The rest of the evening was dedicated to readings
from "An Equal Music," a novel about a string quartet
and romance between two musicians.
Seth was inspired to write the novel when he spot
ted a tall, European man strolling through a park in
London. His friend decided that the man must be a
musician and encouraged Seth to write his novel
about the "musician."
Although Seth felt that he could not write about
music, he eventually managed to develop an appeal
ing character and storyline for this unknown man.
After speaking to members of string quartets, Seth
was able to develop a realistic piece about the lives of
his two main characters, Michael and Julia.
Prof. Kenneth Fields of the English Department's
Creative Writing program, a friend and teacher of
Seth's, introduced the writer to the audience of stu
dents, faculty and community members, describing
him as "talented, funny and warm."
Amanda Gibbon, a junior, said, "Since picking up
my first Vikram Seth book four years ago, lie has def
initely become one of my favorite writers. His novel
consists of fascinating characters, and he really has an
amazing ability to bring them to life for the reader."
Seth said. "I believe a good fic
tion writer must reallv Ik- involved
in the lives ol his characters. I hey
must believe in the people they
write about."
I he audience that filled Cub
bcrlv responded toSeth's readings
and talk with frequent laughter.
"Seth definitely possessed wit in
charming the crowd tonight, but
just seeing this great writer and
hearing him read his works was
most important to me." said (lib
boti.
Additionally, Seth is a the au
thor of five books of poems. He
concluded last night's program
with a reading of three of his
poems and a hook signing.
