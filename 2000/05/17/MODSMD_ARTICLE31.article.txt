# Powwow teaches children about past
## 
### MISHUANA GOEMAN GUEST COLUMNIST 
Kvery Mother's Day lor the last tour
years, I have looked forward to the Si.in
fold Powwow. As a graduate student with a
busy schedule, a family and many obliga
tions, this weekend is always a time lor me
to breathe, relax and visit with all the peo
ple I only get to see passing from ( lass to
(lass.
More importantly, ii is a time to share
with my daughter the vivaeiousness and
beauty of an American Indian community.
Raising my daughter away from home has
been one of the hardest aspects of attend
ing Stanford. As I am from the Kast, it is
(lifli( ult to raise my daughter in many of
the same ways I was raised.
Although powwows are not as much of a

tradition lor my people, I find that the
Stanford Powwow gives me ail opportuni
ty to share with my daughter aspects ol
who we are. This year really stood out, as
her curious mind has begun asking nu
merous questions.
She decided she was in complete love
with the corn and wanted to learn how to
dance. She visited and gleefully played
with the Native Americ an undergraduates,
many of whom she has known since birth.
Seeing all ol Iter favorite people together in
one place was rare moment for Scdonna.
Days have passed and she is still asking
to go hack to the powwow. Spending this
time with her and the community was def
initely the highlight of this quarter for me.
However, 1 believe that any child, re
gardless of their culture, could learn and
grow through this experience as well as any

adult. All those who take time t<> take their
children to see fanciful I)isney movies such
as "El Dorado" and "Pocahontas" should
consider taking their children to this event
that shows the celebration of life and the
continuing cultures of Native people.
fhey will learn that Native people are
alive, diverse, have a rich culture and are
not completely unlike themselves. Seeing
young children in jingle dresses or fancy
dance regalia will hopefully foster a deeper
understanding of Native- people than that
seen in grotesquely misleading pop cult lire.
I his celebration and event makes an im
pact on people of all ages in its capacity to
delight in terms of food, music, jewelry and
c ultural sharing.
