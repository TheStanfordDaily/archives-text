# Dancer Sykes uses hoops as a form of story-telling
## 
### MEGAN KNIZE STAFF WRITER 
Sophomore Ginger Sykes nonchalantly put
music in the stereo and began to dance. But she
was not at a party with friends. Sykes, a mem
ber of the Navajo Nation of Arizona, was prac
ticing a special dance, one she perfected when
she became the first female to hold the title of
hoop dancing world champion in 1997.
Last Wednesday night was practice as usual
for Sykes, who danced Saturday at the pow
wow. She began her practice with a basic kick
ing step, never losing the beat of the music by
an American Indian drum group, the "Young
Heart Singers."
The floor in the practice room in ()ld Union
began to vibrate with her steady steps. She
grabbed one of the colorful hoops and twirled
it around her body.
She incorporated more and more hoops
until she had laced them on her arms like
eagle's wings.
"[Hoop dancing] is telling a story," said
Sykes, who is majoring in Earth Systems. "The
hoops represent the cycles of the earth and a lot
of the way Native Americans think is in cvcles."
According to the powwow program, one
story of the origin of hoop dancing is thai it was
used as a healing ceremony performed by the
Taos Indians of northern New Mexico, who
used one hoop.
"The kids [made the original hoops] from
willow branches," Sykes said. The hoops she
uses are plastic with wood inside and are about
two feet in diameter. She can dance with up to

25 hoops.
In addition to using the hoop to look like an
eagle, Sykes uses the hoops to display butter-
Hies, birds and flowers. Each olSvkes's dances
is less than ten minutes long.
Though Svkes has been dancing since she
was five years old, she began hoop dancing
when she was 14.
"It's mainly a guys' dance, but my uncle
taught me," she said, l he next year, in 1996,
she went to the world championship, where
she earned fourth plat e. She said her dancing
was different from traditional forms because of
her emphasis on gymnastics.
"No one had ever seen a girl do it before,
and I was trained in modern dance so my stvle
was different."
I'he following year, Sykes returned to the
world championships and won, becoming the
world champion hoop dancer in the teenage
division.
The outfit Sykes wears in competitions is
handmade. Her parents beaded her belt and
her mother and aunt sewed the skirt and shirt.
complete with "jingles," which are small metal
bells.
During high school, Svkes said she per
formed about three times a month and trav
eled to Japan and throughout the I'nited
States.
"It's educational, and it combats stereo
types," Sykes said. She has not danced while at
Stanford, but plans to compete next year. S\ kcs
said her parents have been largeh responsible
lor her suc c ess.
"I give them all the credit."
