# Muwekma tribe still actively sharing past, culture with campus
## For the Muwekma Ohlone, Stanford campus land was once called their homeland 
### KEITH ITO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Long before Hoover lower rose in the
shadow of the Foothills, the land current
ly occupied by the Stanford campus was
home to the Muwekma ()hlone tribe.
The Muwekma Ohlone, who are the
namesake of the American Indian theme
house located on 1 lie Row, Muwekma-
Tah-Ruk, inhabited lands on both sides of
the San Francisco Bay spanning from
Napa to Santa Clara.
"They left about 13,000 years of human
history here in the Bay Area," said 1998
graduate Vincent Fuentez, who has re
searched the Muwekma tribe and its past
in California extensively.
According to a historical presentation

by the Muwekma Ohlone I ribal Council
at their Web site, u vvw.muweknui.org, I lie
Muwekma developed a system of s<>< ial
ranking while thev occupied these lands,
and buried their leaders in large earth
mounds, several of which have been dis
covered on the Stanford campus.
During the late 18th and early 19th
centuries, the Muwekma were forced to
live in missions by the Spanish.
Between 1769 and INK), the Muwek
ma population declined from about
20,000 to less than 2,000, w itli much of the
decline due to disease.
After the American annexation of C lali
fornia, the Muwekma were added to the
list of federally recognized tribes In the
Bureau of Indian Affairs in the early
1900s.
However, in 1927, the Muwekma were
abruptly dropped off the list along with
about 135 other California tribes.
"I suspect they were short on staff, and
they figured that if they couldn't do their
job tight, they might as well not do it at
all," said Colin Hampson, a Stanford

alumnus who is now an attorney repre
senting ilie Mnwekina tribe in theireftoi is
to regain federal recognition.
Mnwekina tribal leaders initiated an ef
fort to regain federal recognition in the
I 970 sand filed a formal notice of in tent to
seek recognition with the Bureau ol 11 it I i
.lll Affairs in 1989.
In 1990, the Bureau acknowledged
that the tribe had formerly been recog
nized in the earl\ 1900s, and in 1998, the
Muwekma were able to file a fully docu
mented petition for recognition.
I lowcvcr, the Bureau of Indian Allan s
is currently backlogged in petitions for
recognition, with 21 tribes ahead of the
Muwekma in the process.
"They are pretty close in substance, bill
in terms of time, they are prcti\ far away,
said 1 lanipson. "The big ba< klog means ii
will be about 20 years foi tliein to get to the
Muwekma and finish the process."
"It is the most complicated process you
can imagine," said Fuentez.
"What it boils down to is you liaye to
show political independence and you

have to show vour hision â€” which basi
callv depends on some Spanish gn\ writ
ing about you."
I )espiie the lack of federal recognition,
St.inforcl students and the I diversity have
recognized the Muwekma tribe by renam
ing the American Indian theme house
from Lalhrop to Muwekma-'Tah-Ruk iu
1989.
"When I was an RAin | Muwekma-1 ali-
Ruk's] second year at its current location,
the residential staff decided that it was
time to give the house a name that was rel
evant lo its theme.
"Kveryonc agreed it should honor the
people w hose land it was on," said I lamp
son.
House residents contacted Muwekma
tribal leaders, w ho gave their consent and
a list of words in theii language to use in
the naming process.
Residents of the house and members of
the Stanford American Indian ()i gani/a
tion eventually decided on "Muweknia
l ah-Ruk," which means "house of the
people in the Muwekma language.

After the name was approved by the
University, members of the Muwekma
tribe came to the house and held a cere
mony in which they blessed it.
This blessing became an issue when the
University unsuccessfully attempted to
move the American Indian theme house
to a different location in 1998.
"They wanted to move the house, and
it was a big deal because a lot of the elders
have passed on so we would never be able
to do it again," said senior Desert Horse
Grant of the blessing's significance.
While waiting for their federal petition
for recognition to be approved, the
Muwekma tribe lias been active in educat
ing the public about their history and cul
ture.
I really appreciated the efforts the
Muwekma tribe made in educating peo
ple and establishing a good relationship
with the Stanford Native American com
munity," said Hampson.
"I think a lot of people in the Stanford
community respect that a lot."
