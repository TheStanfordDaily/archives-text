hexagonal Eagle Mountain Drum — t he-
Host Northern Drum — as thev plaveel in
a flag song in the (irancl Entrx.
"That was a veterans' song," said fed
Phelps, a member of the Eagle Mountain
Drum. "It doesn't just honor Indians but
all nationalities who fought in wars."
Phelps said he's been drumming loi 20
years and that he "grew up at powwows."
He said his drum is handmade. I his is the
drum's first appearance at Stanford, and
lie said his purpose is to keep traditions
alive in his community.
"Just as long as we know," lie- said.
"We're not trying to push our ( ulture on
anyone else,"
Fhe importance of the drum was also
evident in the enthusiasm and expertise
ofSonja Holy Eagle of the Dakota Drum
Company who sold drums this weekend.
"It's a way of communicating, and it
brings people together." I lol\ Eagle said.
"You can put your thoughts into it; its a
personal thing." llol\ Fagle said she
drums for personal reasons.
Holy Eagle, who is also a niembei ol
the Sioux tribe, came Ibi the- weekend
from South Dakota where she has been
making drums for eight yeai s.
"I used to do beadwork and drawing,
but I wanted to take a break from it. slu
said. "When I came back, I wanted to
learn leather." She and her colleague,
Dave I lansen, make bate lies ol five to ten
drums every two to lour months.
I loly Fagle said the first step in making
the drums is to select the- wood Ibi the
drums. Thev use Cottonwood trees that

have fallen from natural causes, such as
floods, Fhen they hand-chisel the bark
from the tree, sometimes working up to
ten hours a day. I hey stretch buffalo hide
to make the head of the drum.
We scrape the hair off by hand, and
then we use the hair in the drum stick,"
she said. "Nothing goes to waste."
Most of the drums sell for $210,

In r< >w s of red, white and black triangles.
" 1 hey sa\ this is looking into the back
of a chiefs bonnet," Holy Eagle ex

Although drumming makes up a rich
part of American Indians' cultural her
itage, it isn't complete without dancing.
Schult/ said people come from all over
North America to drum and dance here
at Stanford.
"We have a good reputation for treat

[American Indian students] who come
here go out to be leaders in the commu
nity."
Sc luilt/ said dancers are judged bv au
dience members who evaluate contes
tants' outfits and style. She said they are
also judged on how quickly they stop
when the music stops.
Frida\'s dancing featured exhibitions
with men's and women's traditional and
lancN dancing. I'owvvow materials indi

ed when Indian warriors returned home
from their battles and "would imitate
theii battles and encounters through
dance."
Women's traditional shawl dancing
follows ,i story in which a male butterfly
was killed in battle, and the female

()ne of Friday night's announcers, Titus

\nother tvpe of dance was men's grass

would send dancers into the dancing
arena to stomp down all the long grass to
prepare a clearing," according to the
pow wow program, which was available to
visitors. Friday's dancers spun, stomped
and kicked up dust in what Frenchman
called "foot-slogging style."
Schult/ explained that the regalia —
the outfits — are all handmade. Some of
the more elaborate outfits featured jin
gles. leathers, plumes and tassels.
"It's a special honor to wear leathers,"
Sc hult/ said. "You can see the kids don't
ha\ e i hem yet." She added that men who

their roach, which is a metal headdress
worn on top of their heads.
According to powwow information

In two colorful bustles made from leath
ers. Some of the bustles are as heavy as 25
pounds.
"Some dancers go to powwows every

powwow highway."
Fleven-year-old Chris Jackson is one
such dancer. He said he comes to pow
wows ever) - weekend and he learned his
lavorite dance - the limey dance — from
his grandparents and uncles. Like many
American Indian children, he said he's
