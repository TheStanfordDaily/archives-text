"I saw several invasive photojournalism
snapping photos left and right with long tele
photo lenses penetrating the scene with Hashes,
which distrac ted and interrupted events. I wit
nessed one of the male dancers stop and walk
up to one of the photographers, whose large
cameras — which allowed him to take pictures
