"I saw several invasive photojournalism
snapping photos left and right with long tele
photo lenses penetrating the scene with Hashes,
which distrac ted and interrupted events. I wit
nessed one of the male dancers stop and walk
up to one of the photographers, whose large
cameras — which allowed him to take pictures
from a great distance and with little human in
teraction — dangled at his side. During that
brief conversation, the photographer dis
playecl little visible interest," Dailv staff photog
rapher Setli Newton observed.
Newton walked up to the other photogra
pher and asked what they had talked about.
"I le told me we're supposed to ask permis
sion before we take photos of dancers," the

photographer replied.

" Ib think that one photographer, and many
more, could abuse such cultural values ot gen
erosity and thwart efforts that other photogra
phers, who respectfully represent an event
such as the powwow, was disgusting," Newton
commented.
I le decided thai this man and his approach
to representing the Native American commu
nity at the powwow should be documented,
and Newton photographed this man.
In order to safeguard the rights of the par
ticipants, we discussed with them how we envi
sioned the photographic documentary, what

our aims were, and how the\ could expect the
resulting images and inloi mation to be used.
Photographic: doc umentary work is a series
of individual stories, and the resulting pho
tographs are the photographer's perception of
a particular people and place .it a specific mo
ment.
In other words, we not only observe and
record .1 people or a particular place; these im
ages present something about ourselves.
During our weekly powwow meetings with
its organizers and participants, American Indi
an community members expressed their con
cerns, which centered on their objections to
being typecast as "stoic" or "mystical."
In response to their fears, we sought to pre
sent a searingly personal portrait of their
world. In order to photograph powwow par

sion and, in turn, trust. For this reason, a great deal
of this doc umentary project revolved around build
ing and negotiating relationships with participants.
We regard this photographic essay on the Stan
lord Powwow as a visual diary. Selected from thou
sands of images, these photographs oiler only a
glimpse of the scene.
1 liese photographs feature action in multiple
areas of the frame — a result of our using wide angle
lenses with a large depth of field.
1 hat technique allowed us to home in on our sub
jects wbile, at tlie same time, communicating the mul
tiple layers of reality.
Shorter than normal (less than 50 millimeters
long), wide angle lenses allow the photographer to
remain close to the subject while also contextuali/ing
his or her environment.
Although a wide angle lens grants the technical
privilege of foc using the camera in close proximity to
the subject, a photographer's rapport with her sub
ject ultimately directs the composition and point-of
view of the photograph.
By building more personal relationships with her
subject, the photographer moves past the observa
tional to the participatory.
For instance, former head photo editor, josh
I laner lent Nashoba Simmons bis camera to photo
graph the dancers. Much to our surprise, Nashoba
walked straight into the arena, and began squaring

off dancers for her photographs.
"I did not witness any negative reactions to Nasho
ba for such a bold move. Those dancing and observ
ing interpreted Nashoba's actions in the context of
the Native American community. I see this as an ex
ample of a community necessarily needing to be in
control of its representation," Newton commented.
As outsiders to the American Indian community,
we could not serve this role.
What we had to strive for as photographers was al
lowing those we photographed to direct our actions
so they had some level of participation in their repre
sentation. For this reason, we often surrendered our
cameras to members of the American Indian com
munity to allow them to photograph what they were
experiencing.

and photographers.
Haner was moved by the experience of pho
tographing the powwow. Though once an avid user
of telephoto lenses, the more personal and engaging
style of photography he used at the powwow had a
great effect on him.
"This is an amazing way to shoot," he said.
