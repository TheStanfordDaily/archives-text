# SAIO celebrates 30 years of experiences with community
## 
### CÁITRÍN McKIERNAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
hi the midst of national debate about
civil rights and affirmative action, four
American Indian students at Stanford cre
ated the Stanford American Indian Orga
nization in 1970.
The SAIO's goal was to improve the re
cruitment and retention of Native Ameri
can students, faculty and staff, institutional
ize relevant curriculm, establish and main
tain a community center and theme house
and permanently remove the "Injun joe"
mascot.
As it approaches its 30th anniversary in
October, the SAIO lias made tremendous
strides toward these goals, according to
Denni Woodward, who is Mescalero and
the assistant director of the American Indi
an, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian
Program / Native American Cultural Cen
ter.
Today, there are three faculty members,
more than 50 staff members and approxi
mately 200 Native American students at
Stanford,compared to 25 students in 1970.
The student retention rate has increased
from approximately 50 percent to between
90 and 95 percent.
"Without SAIO, I would have gone
home early (dropped out)," explained Na
tive Hawaiian lan Nui Chun, Class of 1999
and a former SAIO financial head.
"A lot of us came from very small towns,
mostly made up of our families. I laving the
family with other students helped alleviate
some of the homesickness."
1 lie community also helped alleviate the
"culture shock," explained Marcel Begay,
who is a Navajo and Chippewa and a '99
graduate.
"It was good to see other students from
the same background and same experi
ences," he explained.
While Native American students' back
grounds and experiences may be similar,
they come from different tribes across the
Americas.
Becoming friends with students from
different tribes has been a powerful experi
ence, according to SAIO member Wendy
(Jreyeyes, a Navajo and junior.
"There is a tradition where a lot of tribes
were lighting and now we are coining to
gether and forming bonds," she said. Now
"there is a lot of unity."
Stanford's Native American Alumni
community also sticks together. Of the
1,000 Native American alumni, the SAIO
receives calls from 20 different members
each week.
In fact, SAIO will be one of the featured
groups at the 2000 Reunion I loniecoming.
The SAIO serves as an umbrella organi
zation of American Indians, Alaska Natives
and Native 1 lawaiians.
The organization also works in conjunc
tion with a number of other Native Ameri
can student organizations, including the

Native American Big and Little Sibs, the
Stanford American Indian Medical Stu
dents and the American Indian Staff
Forum.
In 1971, SAK) hosted the first Stanford
Powwow. Today, it is the largest student
run powwow in the country.
The powwow's goal is to celebrate the
SAIO and the Native American communi
ty-
"l guess the powwow is comparable to
our parents' weekend," explained Vincent
Fuentez, a Mescalero and former SAIO
member who graduated in 1998.
Each year, the event also aims to wel
come other members of Stanford.
"I think there are still a lot of walls," ex
plained (Ihun.
"1 think a lot can be broken down, and I
think that the powwow is a great way."
In 1972, the SAIO, in a national cam
paign, successfully lobbied then-University
President Richard Lyman to remove Stan
fiord's Indian mascot, citing that the mascot
was disrespectful of Native American cul
ture.
()pponents of the change argued for the
importance of tradition or suggested that
the mascot actually honored the culture.
Despite Stanford's official change to the
Cardinal, the Indian mascot has not com
pletely disappeared.
"There is a black market" for the Stan
ford Indian apparel, explained Wood
ward.
Following the removal of the mascot, the
SAIO helped establish the Native American
Cultural Center in 1973. The Center now
serves as a meeting place for a number of
native groups.
Students from around the country, hop
ing to organize similar communities on
their own campuses, call the center for ad
vice.
SAIO also helped establish Muwekma
Tah-Ruk, the Native American theme
house and successfully lobbied, along with
the Asian American Student's Association,
Black Student Union and MEChA, a Clii
cano/Latino student group, to push for the
formation of the University Committee on
Minority Issues to study the quality of life at
Stanford in 1987
Also. SAIO received a full-time assistant
and director for the American Indian, Alas
ka Native and Native Hawaiian
Program / Native American Cultural Cen
ter in 1989, and helped create the Native
American Studies program, which is now in
its third year.
However, there are only a few Native
American faculty, a number that is current
ly on a decline, and none have tenure, ex
plained Woodward.
While improvement has been made, she
said she feels that there are still many steps
to take.
"We are the smallest group on campus
by far, but our strength overcomes that,"
explained Fuentez.
