# Who has Hepatitis A?
## Impact of contamination remains uncertain; 60 students have received boosters 
### KATIE HILL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
More than a week after I lousing and Din
ing Services revealed ;i possible exposure to
Hepatitis A in several of its dining halls, the
likelihood that some students will fall ill with
the disease is still uncertain and students are
si ill concerned.
Last Sunday's announcement revealed
that students who eat in Wilbur, Florence
Moore and Lagunita dining halls may have
accidentally been exposed to a batch of conta
minated frozen strawberries thai have been

linked to a Hepatitis A outbreak in Massachu
setts.
Upon discovery of the potential exposure,
which occurred between April 21 and 28,
Cowell Student 1 lealth Center began offering
free immunoglobulin (IC) boosters to stu
dents. lb date, approximately 60 students
have elected to get the injection at Cowell or
one of the residence-based stations that were
set up last week, according to Ira Friedman,
director of Cowell.
"()ur medical clinicians have seen a few stu
dents who are sic k with other illnesses who
were worried about having hepatitis A,"
Friedman said. "Also, our nurses were busy
on the phones last week answering lots of anx
ious questions from students. I his week we're
not getting those calls."

1 ali Golan, a freshman in Car
dinal, reported that, while she did
not go to Cowell Student Health
Center to get and IC booster be
cause she has already been vacci
nated against Hepatitis A, "my
roommate [who had not been vac
cinated before the announcement!
is really worried about it."
Shirley Everett, director of
Housing and Dining Services, in
sists that the dining hall is not
planning to avoid strawberries in
the future.
"We have every assurance from
the distributor, manufacturer and
health department that the frozen
sliced strawberries we are current
ly serving are safe to eat. The po
tentially contaminated frozen
sliced strawberries were from a
specific batch, and upon notifica
tion from the distibutor, they were
all returned immediately," she
said.
However, all cause for worry
has not disappeared. "Students

will not be 'in the clear' until 50
clays from the last possible expo
sure," said Friedman. Until then,
"any potentially exposed student
should practice good hand wash
ing and hygiene and not share eat
ing utensils and water bottles."
I he possibility of exposure has
affected those not affiliated with
Dining Services as well. Mike Alli
son, chefat 592 Mayfield, reported
that, after the announcement, all
frozen strawberries were removed
from all Row houses, regardless of
their source. "It's hysteria," he
said.
Freshman Lihi Rosenthal, who
eats in Lakeside Dining Com
mons, feels that Dining Services is
taking extreme measures to as
suage student concerns. "At Lake
side they won't even sell strawber
ry Snapple anymore," she said.
"They're afraid people will be
afraid of it."
Some people, however, feel that
Dining Services is doing the best it
can with a difficult situation.
Sophomore Joe Silber ex
pressed sympathy for Dining Ser
vices, considering they were alert-

Ed to the potential contamination
after having already served some
of the bad berries.
"I think Dining Services is tak
ing a lot more flak than they de
serve," lie said.
Allison concurred. "I think if
the fault lies with anyone it would
be with the processors — the way
they wash the berries and process
them is what could cause the expo
sure. Something like this happens
every few years, but its a pretty big
deal."
Despite many students' worries
about possible exposure, some feel
that the situation lias been blown
out of proportion.
"If people actually wash their
hands it wouldn't be a problem,
but people don't seem to get that,"
said Rosenthal.
Ironically, she noted, "but after
they told us to wash our hands
with a lot of soap, there wasn't any
soap in the bathroom for two
days."
Eric 1 am, a freshman living in
Stern (and thus not among those
students potentially exposed), said
the whole thing seemed a little

overblown.
"I don't really care," he said. "1
don't think it's that big of a deal."
1 le did note that Stern Dining flail
has stopped serving strawberries
and now offers peaches as a top
ping for icecream, yogurt and waf
fles.
Friedman said that he hopes
that some good will come out of
this potential exposure.
"I'd say that there is an in
creased awareness among stu
dents that I fepatitis A can be pre
vented by a vaccine if given in ad
vance of exposure," he said.
As for the future, Everett said,
"Dining Services has demanded
that stricter protocols be followed
by the manufacturers and distrib
utors to provide more accurate
and timelv product recall informa
tion.
"It is Dining Services' policy
and practice to take every precau
tion to ensure the safety and well
being of our customers. We will
continue to work with Dr. Fried
man. the Santa Clara County
I lealth Inspector, and our distrib
utor to keep students informed."
