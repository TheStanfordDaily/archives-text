More than a week after I lousing and Din
ing Services revealed ;i possible exposure to
Hepatitis A in several of its dining halls, the
likelihood that some students will fall ill with
the disease is still uncertain and students are
si ill concerned.
Last Sunday's announcement revealed
that students who eat in Wilbur, Florence
Moore and Lagunita dining halls may have
accidentally been exposed to a batch of conta
minated frozen strawberries thai have been

linked to a Hepatitis A outbreak in Massachu
setts.
Upon discovery of the potential exposure,
which occurred between April 21 and 28,
Cowell Student 1 lealth Center began offering
free immunoglobulin (IC) boosters to stu
dents. lb date, approximately 60 students
have elected to get the injection at Cowell or
one of the residence-based stations that were
set up last week, according to Ira Friedman,
director of Cowell.
"()ur medical clinicians have seen a few stu
dents who are sic k with other illnesses who
were worried about having hepatitis A,"
Friedman said. "Also, our nurses were busy
on the phones last week answering lots of anx
ious questions from students. I his week we're
not getting those calls."
