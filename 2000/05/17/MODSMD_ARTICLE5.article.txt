### CHRISTINA LARSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I loping to capitalize on the momen
tum and public sympathy generated by
the recent janitor strikes in Los Angeles,
Chicago and San Diego, unionized jan
itors in the Bay Area are now in the
process of negotiating a new contract
with their employers.
The current contract, which covers
unionized janitors throughout Silicon
Valley and the East Bay, including
workers at Stanford, is set to expire on
May 31.
Negotiators from the Service Em
ployees International Union Local
1877, which represents 5,500 janitors in
Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa and
San Mateo counties, are asking for a
wage increase ofbetween .$ 1.25 to $ 1.32
pel hour per year for three years, a med
ical plan without monthly payments and
more annual sick or vacation days.

1 he group of about 40 contracting
companies, including .American Build
ing Maintenance, whi< Ii provides Stan
ford with janitorial services, have pro
posed a wage increase of $0.40 in the
first year and $0.30 lor the following
four years and a medical plan which re
quires monthly payments.
On Friday, the first contract bargain
ing session was held between the union
and the contracting companies.
Saturday afternoon, the janitors' dis
satisfaction with this initial oiler was ev
ident. At the union office in San Jose,
workers donned stickers reading "30
cents?! Es una burla! It's an insult!"
The union is now planning demon
strations and preparing petitions in an
attempt to rally public support for their
contract proposals.
Speaking on behall of the President's
Office, Acting General Counsel Debra
Zumwalt said that the University cannot
be held directly accountable for the con

(cms of iis sub-contracted workers
whose services ii employs through ABM.
Zumwalt argued (hat the union and
the University have separate domains ol
concern and responsibility.
However, the janitors are now ac
tively seeking an alliance with building
owners and public officials, including
representatives from the University ad
ministration, who are not directl\ in
voked in the contract negotiations.
Wednesday morning a delegation ol
Stanford janitors plans to deliver a peti
tion to University President Gerhard
Casper calling upon him to support
them in their contract negotiations.
The negotiating period will continue
until the current contract expires at the
end of the month.
Janitors' concerns
According to the California Budget
Report 1999, the basic family budget for

a familv of four with two working par
ents is $53,736. In the fall of 1999, a
union-conducted survey of is members
found that the average income for a jan
itor's household with children fell 37
percent below this figure.
" These workers deserve a raise since
they help make it possible for the high
tech companies, the dot.corns and the
real estate companies to operate and
thrive," said Mel Pritchard. a represen
tative for the union.
"It's a shame many can't afford a de
cent home, food for their families and
other things. I hey need everybody's
support," Pritchard added.
I le explained that many workers are
forced to take on two or three jobs to
pay for the costs of living in this area.
They are "struggling to live where
they work." he said.
