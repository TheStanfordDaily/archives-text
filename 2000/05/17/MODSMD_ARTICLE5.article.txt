# Janitors vie for better pay, benefits
## 
### CHRISTINA LARSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I loping to capitalize on the momen
tum and public sympathy generated by
the recent janitor strikes in Los Angeles,
Chicago and San Diego, unionized jan
itors in the Bay Area are now in the
process of negotiating a new contract
with their employers.
The current contract, which covers
unionized janitors throughout Silicon
Valley and the East Bay, including
workers at Stanford, is set to expire on
May 31.
Negotiators from the Service Em
ployees International Union Local
1877, which represents 5,500 janitors in
Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa and
San Mateo counties, are asking for a
wage increase ofbetween .$ 1.25 to $ 1.32
pel hour per year for three years, a med
ical plan without monthly payments and
more annual sick or vacation days.

1 he group of about 40 contracting
companies, including .American Build
ing Maintenance, whi< Ii provides Stan
ford with janitorial services, have pro
posed a wage increase of $0.40 in the
first year and $0.30 lor the following
four years and a medical plan which re
quires monthly payments.
On Friday, the first contract bargain
ing session was held between the union
and the contracting companies.
Saturday afternoon, the janitors' dis
satisfaction with this initial oiler was ev
ident. At the union office in San Jose,
workers donned stickers reading "30
cents?! Es una burla! It's an insult!"
The union is now planning demon
strations and preparing petitions in an
attempt to rally public support for their
contract proposals.
Speaking on behall of the President's
Office, Acting General Counsel Debra
Zumwalt said that the University cannot
be held directly accountable for the con

(cms of iis sub-contracted workers
whose services ii employs through ABM.
Zumwalt argued (hat the union and
the University have separate domains ol
concern and responsibility.
However, the janitors are now ac
tively seeking an alliance with building
owners and public officials, including
representatives from the University ad
ministration, who are not directl\ in
voked in the contract negotiations.
Wednesday morning a delegation ol
Stanford janitors plans to deliver a peti
tion to University President Gerhard
Casper calling upon him to support
them in their contract negotiations.
The negotiating period will continue
until the current contract expires at the
end of the month.
Janitors' concerns
According to the California Budget
Report 1999, the basic family budget for

a familv of four with two working par
ents is $53,736. In the fall of 1999, a
union-conducted survey of is members
found that the average income for a jan
itor's household with children fell 37
percent below this figure.
" These workers deserve a raise since
they help make it possible for the high
tech companies, the dot.corns and the
real estate companies to operate and
thrive," said Mel Pritchard. a represen
tative for the union.
"It's a shame many can't afford a de
cent home, food for their families and
other things. I hey need everybody's
support," Pritchard added.
I le explained that many workers are
forced to take on two or three jobs to
pay for the costs of living in this area.
They are "struggling to live where
they work." he said.
Most janitors who work at Stanford
cannot afford to live in the imme
diate area and must make long
commutes to work.
Jose Quintanilla, an ABM em
ployee and a janitor at Stanford,
and his wife Ana, a janitor in Santa
Clara, pay $905 monthly for an
apartment in San Jose. Quintanil
la works from 6:30 p.m. until 2:30
a.m. In rush hour traffic, it takes
him approximately 1 hour to drive
to Stanford. Before he owned a
car, he spent three hours each
night commuting to Palo Alto on a
series of three buses.
Quintanilla is not paid for the
time he spends commuting, but he
must factor the costs of gas and car
repairs into his budget.
His wife now pays $ 15 a week to
carpopl with a co-worker because
the family only owns one car.
Quintanilla says he is lighting
for "an increase in salary because
the current salary is not sufficient."
When Quintanilla arrives
home in the morning after work,
his four children are already
asleep. He would like more vaca
tion days to be able to spend with
them, but for now, he says, "1
can't afford to lose a day of work,
or even to be late."
One consistent goal of the jani
tors campaign has been exposing
the growing disparity between rich
and poor in the Bay Area.
In the words of the union peti
tion to be delivered to Casper,
" The economy is booming as
never before. Yet despite the un
precedented prosperity of both
the Bay Area's commercial real es
tate market and Silicon Valley hi
tech fu nis, our wages remain too
low to lift our families out ofpovei -
ty."
l'ritchard added, "In Silicon
Valley especially, where all the
money is, people can atlord to pay
more."
University position
Although she sympathizes with
the high costs of living in Silicon
Valley, Zumwalt questions the ex
tent to which the University holds
the power or responsibility to im
prove the janitors' situation.
She explained the University's
position that Stanford can only be
held accountable lor workers

whom the University hires direct
ly.
Zumwalt argued that the re
sponsibility for addressing the
workers' concerns does not lie with
the University, but with the union.
" They're the ones who have the
responsibility and authority to ne
gotiate on behalf of the workers,"
she said.
She added, "It would be pre
sumptuous of Stanford to say that
the) know better what the janitors'
want than their duly elected union
officials."
She said that the University is
not directly involved in the current
contract negotiation process,
which takes place solely between
the union representatives and the
constituency of contracting com
panies.
"Stanford, like every other busi
ness, values quality, service and
price," said Zumwalt. "The more
[janitorial services] cost, that's
more money to come out of tu
ition, donations or other sources of
money that are needed to keep the
University operating."
According to Zumwalt, the Uni
versity's agreement with ABM re
garding the price that it is willing
to pay for services is not directly
translatable to janitorial wages.
When asked whether Stan
ford's stipulations on price might
put pressure on how ABM settles
their contract with the janitor's
union, she said, "Stanford negotia
tions with ABM cover price for ser
vice, not labor costs."
Stanford contracts through
ABM to clean all University build
ings, except those operated bv
I lousing and Dining Services, she
said. "There's a different set of re
sponsibilities [regarding Housing
and Dining janitors] because those
workers are actual University em
ployees." she acknowledged.
She emphasized that her exper
tise was not in the particularities of
the union contract now being ne
gotiated or the current demands
of the janitors.
Labor campaigns outside
Stanford
As a union organizer, Gomez
looks to the recent janitors' cam
paign in Los Angeles for inspira
tion, noting the significant roles
played by intervening third par
ties.
During the period of contract

negotiations in Los Angeles, Sena
tors Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif)
and Eclward Kennedy (I)-Mass) is
sued statements in support of the
striking janitors.
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, a
supporter of the union campaign,
joined county Supervisor Zev
Yaroslavskv in making a confer
ence call to the CEO of Arden Re
alty. the largest building owner in
Los Angeles.
Arden subsequently an
nounced in a press release: "We
empathize with the janitors and
support their desire to earn a fair
wage. . AVe will do everything in
our power to support that effort
and have shared this view with our
vendors."
Building owner Rob Maquire
also intervened in the negotiating
process, calling janitors back to the
tables and preventing a stalemate.
Maquire said tli.it the difficult and
prolonged negotiation process
made him reconsider the role that
building owners played in setting
wages for janitors. "In the future,
we will be involved." he said.
However, Geoff Ely, president
of the Building Owners and Man
agers Association, did not share
Maquire's conclusion.
"The fact of the matter is [the
industry of building owners] is not
a homogenous group, and that's
why owners don't take a role in
those negotiations," he said.
Mike Garcia, Local 1N77 presi
dent in Los Angeles, called the
union s strategy of creating coali
tions with local building managers,
business owners, politicians and
religious leaders a success.
112 fe described the campaign as a
model for future union ac tion, and
said, "We wanted to show that a
group of workers can organi/e
and lift themselves out of povert\ if
they bring enough pressure."
What role is a university willing
or able to play?
Chris Cluistoflerson. associate
vice provost for facilities said that
Stanford "is not party, legallx oth
erwise, to the [current union] ne
gotiation process. As such, the
University will not attempt to in
tervene in the negotiations them
selves."
Recently, the role of a universi
ty in determining wage standards
for both its hired and out-soureed
workers has been both debated .11

other national campuses.
In response to pressure from
local labor ac tion groups, the pres
idents of I farvard and Johns 1 fop
kins Universities have issued state
ments of qualified support for the
labor campaigns on their c ampus
es.
In early May, Harvard Presi
dent Neil L Rudenstine approved
recommendations of an Ad Hoc
Committee on Employment Poli
cies to increase benefits for both
hired and out-sourcecl workers,
but did not uphold suggestions for
creating a 'living wage," defined as
the hourly pay required to keep a
family of four above the poverty
line.
In March, Johns Hopkins Uni
versity's President William Brody
declined to sign a living wage
pledge; however, he did cite the
university's "position to set an ex
ample in the < it\" and pledged to
support a moderate wage increase
for workers. I le described his com
mitment as "consistent with the
values at the core of 1 lopkins."
Stanford does not currently
have a living wage campaign in
place. However, the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition has been
involved in planning demonstra
tions ,uid teach-ins on campus to
support local union campaigns.
What next?
Lnion leaders such as Gomez
and Pritchard have expressed a
sense of rising momentum in the
labor movement. A bulletin board
in the San |ose union office is cov
ered with newspaper clippings
from recent labor campaigns in
oilier c iiies and in the Bay Area.
In late April, over MOO workers
and faniih members attended a
rall\ for janitors iu Mountain
View.
More demonstrations are
planned foi the weeks leading up
to the Max !'»I deadline for contract
negotiation.
Veronica Lope/, one of the
members of the contracting nego
tiating team fbi the union said,
"It's hard to know what will hap
pen in three weeks."
I ioine/ added, "The movement
is escalating. We're moving up
step by step."
President Casper declined to
comment lor this article, but desig
nated Xuniwalt as Ins representa
tive speaker 011 the subject.
