agreement with the UC system. Talks resume next week
amid signs of growing tension.
! Tilings are getting dangen his here, and we can't get

room nurse. " Hie nurses are very serious about what we

Trophy thief to stand trial
* LOS ANGELES (AF) — A judge on Tuesday ordered
a 38-year-old trucker to stand trial in the disappearance
of dozens of gold-plated Oscar statuettes.
1 Lawrence Ledent of Los Angeles was ordered by Su
perior Court Judge Michael K. Kellogg to appear in
court May 30 to enter a plea to grand theft.
Indent has been free on bail since March 21. His at
torney, Jay Jafle, asked the judge to reduce the charge to
receiving stolen property, saying Indent thought the
boxes filled with Oscars were only carrying shirts or hats.
Jafle said his client "was unaware at the time the pal
lets were placed on his trailer that they were, in fact, the
Oscars. I think the fact that he didn't take them back
would indicate how shocked he was once he realized
what he had."
Fifty-two of the awards were found March 19 next to
a Koreatown Dumpster by salvage man Willie Fulgear.
Fulgear received a $50,000 reward from Roadway Ex
press and two tickets to the March 26 Academy Awards
show.
Three of the Oscars are still missing.
ACADEMIA
U.S. third in proportion of
college graduates
For the first time, international-education statistics
show that three countries — Norway, Britain and the
Netherlands — surpass the United States in the propor
tion of young people who graduate from college, ac
cording to a report being released today.
The report, by the Paris-based Organization for Eco
nomic Cooperation and Development, which pools data
from 29 democratic, market-oriented countries that l>e
long to the organization and 10 nonmeniber countries,
can be ordered on the World Wide Web.
" I'he U.S. continues to have very high college gradu
ation rates, but it no longer has the highest in the
0.E.C.D.," says Andreas Schleicher, principal adminis
trator of the organization's Center for Educational Re
search and Innovation.
The last edition of the report was issued in December
1998, and that edition indicated that the United States
led in college-graduation rates but trailed 22 other coun
tries in completing high school, after having once been
the world leader in that category.
