As the Daily prepares for Friday's annual
New Starters' issue, it is interesting to; note
that in the past, student journalists geared
up for a similar tradition, the Women's Edi
tion. Almost seventy years ago, a short arti
cle titled "Femininity Rule Holds Reign on
Daily Today" ran on the front '
"Once again the feminine journalists
have shown their literary perspicacity and
general ability — these four pages have
proved that.
"Strange that the women's edition of the
Daily is not pink or purple — as was the cus
tom in the past — perhaps the white sheets
indicate that even the 'elite' 500 are advo
cating a single standard.
"In addition to this movement, the sweet
er TYPE-R woman has demonstrated her
ability to become overnight FRANK, and a
few other people. When the great Stanford
public REIDS this, there will be no Dick
ering about its faith in the efficiency and
cleverness of Stanford women. No MOORE
proof is necessary."
The Bottom Line: As we at the History Corner
see again and again, times have changed so lit
tle in seven decades — The Daily is still an es
trogen-swamped institution where men are op
pressed. Look for our special pink and purple B-
