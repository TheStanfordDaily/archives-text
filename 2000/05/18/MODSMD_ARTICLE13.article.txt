Jamie Sahara had about five
hours to kill between practices Fri
day, so he went to watch the nation's
best.
In Palo Alto, Calif., for the North
western men's tennis team's NCAA
tournament match against No. 1 ,
Stanford, Sahara and a few team
mates toured the school's massive
athletic complex to watch several of
Stanford's nationally ranked teams
practice.
What they saw was intensity, com
petitiveness and spectators at every
venue — even water polo.
'It was cool to see how you could go
from practice to practice and the in
tensity level stayed the same,' Sahara
says. 'It seemed like everyone was
very dedicated.'
