violated.
Earlier, the administration had said that Sankoli,
by*his actions, may yvell have forfeited his right to the
amnesty he and his forces were granted as part < >112 the
peace agreement.
''Amnesty International USA. meanwhile,
expressed grave concern that Sankoli yvon't be
brought to justice despite continuing hitman rights
violations by his forces.
The group said the violations are "serious breach
es of international humanitarian law and possible
crimes against humanity."

impunity to the perpetrators of atrocities and human
