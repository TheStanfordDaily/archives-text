# House votes to limit troop involvement
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
House yesterday joined the Sen
ate in seeking to limit the involve
ment of U.S. ground troops in the
Kosovo peacekeeping mission.
The administration warns that
such restrictions are a threat both
to peace in Kosovo and NATO's
future.
In a bipartisan 264-153 vote,
the House said the president must
certify by next April 1 that Euro
pean allies have met their finan
cial commitments to the program
to rebuild Kosovo. Without that
certification, the president would
have 30 days to submit a plan for
the withdrawal of U.S. troops.
It's time to send a strong mes
sage to European allies, said Rep.
John Kasich, R-Ohio, leader of a
bipartisan group sponsoring the
amendment to a defense autho
rization bill the House will vote on
later this week.
"The more heat we keep on,
the more effective it is not just for
our soldiers but also for the Amer
ican taxpayer and 1 think for
mutual security," Kasich said.
On the Senate side, a military
construction spending bill now on
the floor would require U.S.
troops to leave Kosovo by July 1,
2001, unless the president
requests and Congress approves
an extension.
Sen. John Warner, R-Va.,
sponsor of the provision with Sen.
Robert Byrd, I)-W.Va., says it is
time to recognize that Congress,

which has the constitutional
power of the purse, deserves an
equal role in determining U.S.
policy.
But Defense Secretary William
Cohen said Tuesday that a self
imposed deadline for the with
drawal of American peacekeeping
trtKips would precipitate similar
pullouts by European nations, set
ting the stage for more violence in
Kosovo and calling into question
NATO's viability.
Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, in a speech to the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, also
warned yesterday that any "pre
mature" withdrawal would be
interpreted in the Balkans as a
sign of weakness. "We cannot
afford that in a region where
weakness attracts vultures."
Texas Cov. George W. Bush,
the likely Republican presidential
nominee, has opposed the Senate
plan as "legislative overreach."
Cohen has said he would rec
ommend that President Clinton
veto the $8.6 billion military con
struction bill — which also con
tains $4.7 billion in emergency
funds for U.S. operations in Koso
vo and anti-drug efforts in Colom
bia — if the Warner-Byrd lan
guage is not removed.
Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and
John McCain R-Ariz., plan to offer
alternative language under which
the Kosovo operation would con
tinue unless Congress specifically
votes to end it.
