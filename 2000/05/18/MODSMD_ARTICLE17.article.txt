# Suns' season cut short
## 
### 
PHOENIX (AP) â€” Despite
the awful way it ended, the
Phoenix Suns consider their sea
son a success, especially with all
that the team endured.
Still, coach Scott Skiles admit
ted it will take a few days to get
over the 87-65 pummeling the
Suns took from the Los Angeles
Lakers in the deciding Game 5 of
the Western Conference semifi
nals Tuesday night.
"It's still kind of bitter pill to
swallow," Skiles said after he met
with each player yesterday, "but
I'm sure within the next few days
I'll look back on it and realize
that it was a great year overall."
The Suns finished the season
53-29, tied for the fourth-best
record in the West. They elimi
nated the defending champion

San Antonio Spurs, minus Tim
Duncan, to advance past the first
round of the playoffs for the first
time in five years.
And they gave the Lakers a big
scare in Los Angeles in Game 2,
played them close again in Game
3 and routed them in Game 4.
All of this despite a litany of
problems in the regular season,
den on Dec. 17.
"This was an unbelievably
crazy year. I don't think I've ever
seen anything like it," Skiles said.
"I've been on teams with a rash of
injuries before, but not combined
with a coaching change and one
of the players almost dying."
Jason Kidd and Penny Hard
away hardly had a chance to
determine just how good they
can be together.
