BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — Two former Ku Klux
Klansmen were arrested on minder charges yesterday in the
1963 Birmingham church bombing that killed four black
girls on a Sunday morning, a crime that shocked the nation
and galvanized the civil rights movement.
Thomas E. Blanton Jr. of Birmingham, who is in his early
60s, and Bobby Frank Cherry, 69, of Mabank, Texas, sur
rendered on the state charges and were jailed without bail.
II convicted, they could get life in prison with the possibility
of parole.
Prosecutors have long suspected that Blanton and Cher
ry plotted with former Klansman Robert Edward Chambliss
to bomb the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church. Chambliss was
convicted in 1977 and died in prison in 1985. A fourth sus
pect, I lerman Cash, was never charged; he, too, is dead.
U.S. Attorney Doug Jones would not say what led to the
break in the case after 37 years. But over the past year,
estranged family members of Cherry have said publicly that
he talked of helping plant the dynamite.
The blast was one of the most shocking crimes of the civil
rights era and came just months after police in Birmingham
used dogs and Firehoses to drive back black marchers.
T he Sept. 15, 1963, blast demolished an outside wall of
the church and killed four girls who were in a basement
restroom, preparing for a youth program: 11-year-old
Denise McNair and three 14-year-olds: Cynthia Wesley,
Carole Robertson and Addie Mae Collins.
The indictment marked the latest in a series of 1960s
racial crimes in the South that are being brought for prose
cution decades later.
In 1994, Byron de la Beckwith was convicted in the 1963

assassination in Jackson, Miss., of NAACP organizer Medgar
Evers. In 1998, former KKK leader Samuel H. Bowers, 73,
was found guilty in the 1966 firebomb death of Mississippi
civil rights activist Vernon Dahmer.
"No one should stop until the people who are responsible
are brought to justice," Attorney General Janet Reno said in
Washington.
Blanton and Cherry for years have denied any role in the
Birmingham bombing.
Mickey Johnson, Cherry's lawyer, said his client is in ill
health. "He wants the world to know his story, and he
thinks he'll be vindicated," said Johnson.
Blanton and Cherry were charged with eight counts of
murder each — two counts covering each of the four slain
girls. One count was for intentional murder and the other
involved "universal malice" because the bomb was placed
where it could have killed any number of people.
Jones said the evidence lent itself better to state charges
than to federal ones. He said the capital murder statute on
the books in 1963 could not be used because it was replaced
in the mid-1970s after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down
capital punishment.
Stanley Wilson, 39, a black man who works for a staffing
services company, said it was unfair that whoever bombed
the church had remained free for decades.
"They should have taken care of this a long time ago," he
said. But a white resident, Stan Leo, who was 16 when the
church was bombed, questioned the point of pursuing the
case.
"I'm sorry it all happened," he said, 'but it needs to be
buried and put aside and let the city go on.
