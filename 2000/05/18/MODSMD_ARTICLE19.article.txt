## The
						Stanford Daily Comm Dept. makes strides with new tracks

The communication depart
ment's decision to redesign its curricu
lum — approving a new set of three aca
demic "tracks" to be offered to those pursuing
the communication major — represents a
meaningful re-evaluation of the field of com
munication and, based upon that, the way in
which Stanford's Communication Department
can best serve its majors.
The tracks, which are recommended, but
not required, are designed to give communica
tion majors the freedom to pursue the major
from a more interdisciplinary angle. Communi
cation Technologies, the first track, includes
courses in computer science and science, tech
nology and society. The second, Communica
tion and Public Affairs, allows communication

majors to branch out into political science, psy
chology and public policy courses. The last,
Media Practices and Performance, includes
only communication courses but provides a
broad perspective on 112 ilm and journalism.
This redesign is perhaps most valuable in its
efforts to make available a more interdisci
plinary approach to the communication cur
riculum. With the field of communication
undergoing rapid changes, particularly with
respect to technology, a corresponding redirec
tion of Stanford's communication curriculum
was not only necessary, but essential. Such a
change enables communication students to
remain on the cutting edge of their field.
One contentious part of the changing cur
riculum is the fazing out of Communication

136/236, Broadcast Journalism, taught by vis
iting professor Larry Bensky since 1992. The
loss of this extremely popular course, and the
resulting distress, highlights the larger issue of
what some students perceive as an increasing
lack of hands-on courses in the Communication
Department.
Although few would doubt the validity of this
concern, a closer look at the redesign of the
communication curriculum seems to indicate a
trend toward increased practicality on the part
of the current Communication Department,
not a move away from this area. Although,
admittedly, the number of hands-on courses
has decreased, the flexibility and vision of the
new tracks opens doors for communication
majors to gain practical experience in a variety

of areas — previously unavailable experience
that proves invaluable in the so-called "real
world" of journalism and other communica
tion-related fields.
Furthermore, critics must recognize that the
mission of Stanford's Communication Depart
ment, unlike that of similar departments at - -
trade schools, remains to establish a theoretical
framework for Communication students, pro- »
viding them with the fundamental knowledge t «
to tackle a wide range of Communication issues (
in more "practical" settings in the future. The
Communication Department's redesign not
only creates such a framework, it also addresses
admirably the questions of theory and change ,
that face those in the constantly evolving field of
Communication.
