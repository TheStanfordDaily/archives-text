# Admit yield hits record high
## Two-thirds of admits accept offer for spot in Class of 2004; fewer Californians to comprise new class 
### JED ROSE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I he Admissions Office in ()ld Union was flood
ed with letters saying, "Yes! I want to go to Stan
ford" this past weekend, as a record (>7 percent of
admitted students accepted their places in Stan
ford's Class 0f2004.
"Taking 300 fewer this year was the way to go,

and the yield went up as we predicted," reported
Robert Kinnally, clean of undergraduate admis
sion and financial aid.
The record yield rate follows one of Stanford's
most selective admissions rounds in history. Only
1,921 students were accepted out of 16,273 appli
cations during the regular round this year, a 12
percent admit rate.
"I think it had to do with the continuing popu
larity of Stanford that comes from Stanford being
in the press all the time," Kinnally said. "1 think it
doesn't hurt when you have something like David
Kennedy winning the Pulitzer Prize [this year]."
Hie enrollment numbers continue a promising
trend of an increasing yield rate for the past four

years. Stanford's matriculation rate lias remained
among the top two or three in the nation.
Kinnally attributed the increase in yield to the
helping of faculty and students in giving the ad
mitted students a real Stanford perspective. "We
never had as many faculty participating in the
yield programs â€” not to mention the help of the
Stanford Ambassadors," a group of students who
answer prospective students' questions and visit
high schools around the nation.
Despite the record yield, Stanford still went to the
waiting list to grab a few lucky students. "We did go
to the wait list this year," Kinnally said. "We took 16

students from the wait list, and I
think that will get us through the
summer."
Stanford will enroll about 1,600
students, the number desired. The
waiting list was used only due to the
natural drop-off of some incoming
students during the summer.
All scholastic numbers for this
incoming class remained at their
usual top form. "The statistics for
this year's class are almost identical
to last year's class," said Kinnally,
noting that more than 70 percent
of last year's class got above a 700
on their math and verbal sections
of the SAT.
Kinnally added that next year's
class can best be characterized by
"their commitment to service and
they take initiative in a way that
their peers usually don't."
Another trend that has contin
ued is the steady decrease of Cali
fornia representation. This year
the number is only 35 percent,
continuing a trend over the past

four years which has seen the per
centage of students from the state
drop from the mid-40s to its cur
rent level.
"We are seeing a steady, higher
number of applications from the
Mid-Atlantic and New England
areas. They represent 18 percent of
the admitted class," Kinnally said.
"We have a list of people who
have already inquired for next
year's application. This year we al
ready have 25,700 inquiries for the
fall of 2001. It will get up to about
65,000 [total application requests]."
That number was 23,000 at this
same time last year, a sign that
total applications to get into Stan
ford is not slowing down. One pos
sible reason for Stanford's increase
is the availability of the application
in an online format.
Kinnally projects that in 10
years the whole application may
become paperless. He cited that
over 3,000 applied via the Internet
this year and Old Union is expect
ing up to a 20 percent increase in
online applications for next year.
"We're excellent, we're a hot
school."
