# MODERN LIFE IS RUBBISH
## Blowing up the moon 
### 
Last year brought yet another
round of scandal from the Viet
nam era, as CNN announced
that the U.S. military had reck
lessly exposed soldiers to napalm gas,
causing all manners of long-term health
effects.
The whole thing turned out to he an
apparent fabrication on the part of a cou
ple of veterans, and Ted Turner himself
was forced to make a shamefaced national
apology. For the moment, it seemed that
we could all rest a little easier in our
national conscience.
lint the sins of the past have a way of
continuing to turn up, and the most
recent skeleton was brought to light yes
terday as Chicago physicist Leonard Rief
fel revealed that during the 1950s he was
in charge of a top-secret NASA project to
detonate an atom bomb on the moon.
"There was lots of talk on the part of
the Air Force about the moon being mili
tary high ground," Rieffel explained. The
apparent rationale for the blast was that it
would reassure Americans that their
country had an effective nuclear deter
rent, and simultaneously intimidate the
Kremlin.

These days, we're all
familiar with the idea
that the extrenle nuc le
ar hysteria depicted in
Films like "Dr.
Strangelove" isn't too
far from the way things
actually were. The
McCarthy witch hunts
and children trained to

hide under their desks to protect from a
blast now seem appropriately ridiculous
— but a nuclear blast on the moon? This
is something new.
Thankfully, the project was abandoned
once the military realized the potentially
disastrous effects if the blast were to go
wrong and detonate in the upper atmo
sphere. If they were going to blow the
planet to hell, they were going to do it on
their own terms, and so the project —
innocuously titled "A Study of Lunar
Research Flights" — was scrapped.
lhe most interesting bit of trivia associ
ated with this revelation was that the
NASA team included a promising young
physicist named Carl Sagan. The man


Paul K«rs<h*n
Vvlto was a fixture on our television sets in
the 1980s, educating and inspiring us all
with the beauty of celestial objects, was
once involved in trying to blow them up.
. .But the most likely effect of this revela
tioty assuming it has any effect before
everybody forgets about it in two weeks,
will be to further undermine America's
already shaky credibility with the interna

tional community. This was bound to hap
pen once the world's lone superpower
decided to metamorphose into the world's
policeman. After all, nobody likes the
cops, particularly when they can't keep
their own house in order.
Take the current battle in Congress
over whether China's human rights viola
tions should affect its trade status. This
seemed fairly straightforward and
humanitarian until last week, when the
London-based Amnesty International
issued a report dozens and dozens of
pages in length condemning the United

States for its sponsoring of torture in
police interrogations.
It's hard to say how serious the report
is, given that interrogations by nature
occur behind closed doors, but it does
serve to erode our moral high ground. Or
take the fact that the United States is one
of the only nations in the world that has
not signed the current U. N. declaration
in support of women's rights.
This declaration, which among other
things takes a stance against the female
genital mutilation still rampant in parts of
Africa, is currently deadlocked in

Congress because a significant body of leg
islators don't want a foreign body telling
them how to treat their women.
One argument proposes that if the
United States signs the declaration, it
would eliminate such wholesome Ameri
can traditions as Mother's Day. This argu
ment naturally surfaced a week before the
holiday in question, and whichever legis
lator came up with it really ought to be
ashamed of himself.
Granted, it's a largely symbolic gesture,
as the United Nations has proved singu
larly ineffective since its shining moment

in (lie Persian Gulf war. Bosnian Serbs
have recently taken to capturing peace
keepers and tying them to posts at bomb
ing sites to function as deterrents.
The idea that one has a moral respon
sibility to police the world is relatively new,
and without the driving force of Cold War
ideology it's still unclear how this will play
out in practice. But one can safely say that
blowing up the moon is probably not the
best way to go about it.
