## Blowing up the moon

Last year brought yet another
round of scandal from the Viet
nam era, as CNN announced
that the U.S. military had reck
lessly exposed soldiers to napalm gas,
causing all manners of long-term health
effects.
The whole thing turned out to he an
apparent fabrication on the part of a cou
ple of veterans, and Ted Turner himself
was forced to make a shamefaced national
apology. For the moment, it seemed that
we could all rest a little easier in our
national conscience.
lint the sins of the past have a way of
continuing to turn up, and the most
recent skeleton was brought to light yes
terday as Chicago physicist Leonard Rief
fel revealed that during the 1950s he was
in charge of a top-secret NASA project to
detonate an atom bomb on the moon.
"There was lots of talk on the part of
the Air Force about the moon being mili
tary high ground," Rieffel explained. The
apparent rationale for the blast was that it
would reassure Americans that their
country had an effective nuclear deter
rent, and simultaneously intimidate the
Kremlin.

These days, we're all
familiar with the idea
that the extrenle nuc le
ar hysteria depicted in
Films like "Dr.
Strangelove" isn't too
far from the way things
actually were. The
McCarthy witch hunts
and children trained to

hide under their desks to protect from a
blast now seem appropriately ridiculous
— but a nuclear blast on the moon? This
is something new.
Thankfully, the project was abandoned
once the military realized the potentially
disastrous effects if the blast were to go
wrong and detonate in the upper atmo
sphere. If they were going to blow the
planet to hell, they were going to do it on
their own terms, and so the project —
innocuously titled "A Study of Lunar
Research Flights" — was scrapped.
lhe most interesting bit of trivia associ
ated with this revelation was that the
NASA team included a promising young
physicist named Carl Sagan. The man
