Students offer ethnically-unrelated
perspective on Arab-Israeli conflict
This letter is in response to those criticizing the
display in White Plaza by Muslem students on the
anniversary of Israel's creation. As neither Israelis
nor Palestinians, we feel as though we can act as
impartial observers.
The War of 1948 obviously had horrible conse
quences for both sides, but we feel that the display in
White Plaza had a broader message than simply
condemning the acts of Israel during that war. The
display also serves to highlight the situation in which
many Palestinians currently find themselves, with
few rights and no voice with which to express their
opinions.
Furthermore, the display underscored recent
acts carried out by the state of Israel and the Israeli
Defense Force. One of the tombstones in White
Plaza represented those who died at Qana, a United
Nations installment in southern Lebanon that the
Israeli Defense Force attacked in 1996.
Those attacked included Palestinian refugees and
the Fijian soldiers working for the United Nations to
protect them. The United Nations stated that it was
unlikely that the attack was accidental as the Israelis
claim. Many other organizations, such as Amnesty
International, go so far as to say that the attack was
deliberate. In any event, over 100 people died as a

result of the attack.
We feel that it is important to have an open dia
logue about the issues in the Middle East. The
Muslem students were simply trying to raise aware
ness about the issue. We in the United States are
often bombarded with images of Islamic terrorists,
but there is little media attention paid to the crimes
of the Israelis. The U.S. government has an obvious
pro-Israel bias, as is evident in their foreign aid to
Israel.
To fully grasp the situation in the Middle East, it
is important to understand all sides of the issue. We
would support Israelis expressing their voice on
these issues as well, but we feel that sweeping the
problems under the rug in the hope of peace accom
plishes little.
