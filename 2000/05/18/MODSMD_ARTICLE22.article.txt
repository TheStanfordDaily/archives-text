Students offer ethnically-unrelated
perspective on Arab-Israeli conflict
This letter is in response to those criticizing the
display in White Plaza by Muslem students on the
anniversary of Israel's creation. As neither Israelis
nor Palestinians, we feel as though we can act as
impartial observers.
The War of 1948 obviously had horrible conse
quences for both sides, but we feel that the display in
White Plaza had a broader message than simply
condemning the acts of Israel during that war. The
display also serves to highlight the situation in which
many Palestinians currently find themselves, with
few rights and no voice with which to express their
opinions.
Furthermore, the display underscored recent
acts carried out by the state of Israel and the Israeli
Defense Force. One of the tombstones in White
Plaza represented those who died at Qana, a United
Nations installment in southern Lebanon that the
Israeli Defense Force attacked in 1996.
Those attacked included Palestinian refugees and
the Fijian soldiers working for the United Nations to
protect them. The United Nations stated that it was
unlikely that the attack was accidental as the Israelis
claim. Many other organizations, such as Amnesty
International, go so far as to say that the attack was
deliberate. In any event, over 100 people died as a

result of the attack.
We feel that it is important to have an open dia
logue about the issues in the Middle East. The
Muslem students were simply trying to raise aware
ness about the issue. We in the United States are
often bombarded with images of Islamic terrorists,
but there is little media attention paid to the crimes
of the Israelis. The U.S. government has an obvious
pro-Israel bias, as is evident in their foreign aid to
Israel.
To fully grasp the situation in the Middle East, it
is important to understand all sides of the issue. We
would support Israelis expressing their voice on
these issues as well, but we feel that sweeping the
problems under the rug in the hope of peace accom
plishes little.

Critics not justified in writing off MSAN
display as result of ongoing conflict
As one of the participants in Monday's MSAN
exhibit titled "Palestine: 52 Years of
Oppression," I think it is imperative, as
Justine Fisher suggested on Tuesday
("Students upset by display in White
Plaza"), that we frame the events that
occurred over the last half-century in the
correct context.
While we may all pray and hope that
peace becomes the word of order in the
region, we cannot forget or try to erase
the past. Just as none of us should deny
the atrocities committed by Germany in
World War 11, none of us should try and
argue that we do not remember what
happened in Palestine. Additionally, we
should have the courage to separate fact
from emotion and try to build a reconcil
able future together.
With that said, in coming to terms with
the history, I think it is important to note
that the state of Israel has waged a sys
tematic, institutionalized and state-spon
sored reign of terror Palestinian
and Lebanese civilians over the past five
decades. This oft publicized history is
precisely what MSAN wanted to bring to
Stanford's attention.
While 1 believe our exhibit successfully
conveyed this message, some in the Stan
ford community may by confused by
Fisher's Tuesday remarks that attempted
to condone Israel's human rights viola
tions by citing the ongoing armed conflict
between Israel and her Palestinian and
I .(jfianese neighbors.
JLet us all be clear on this. The Fourth
GttKeva Convention on Rules of War,
adopted in 1949 by the international
community in response to Nazi atrocities
clearly states that under no cir
cumstances, even in times of war, are the
acts that MSAN publicized Monday to be
tolerated.
This international treaty governs the
treatment of civilians during wartime,

including bystanders and civilians in ter
ritory under military occupation. The
convention outlaws torture, collective
punishment and the resettlement by an
occupying power of its own civilians on
territory under its military control.
A brief history:
On June 5, 19(57, Israeli military forces
attacked the neighboring Arab countries
of Egypt, Jordan and Syria. The invading
forces subsequently occupied the Gaza
Strip, which was under Egyptian rule, the
West Bank, including East Jerusalem
which was under Jordanian control, the
Sinai Peninsula, which is now part of
Egyptian territory and the Golan Heights
of Syria.
Immediately after occupying the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Israeli mili
tary commanders of each region issued
pronouncements accepting the applica
bility of the Fourth Geneva Convention
to the two territories. Three months later,
however, the two commanders modified
their positions to reflect a rejection of the
applicability of the convention to the
regions.
Since that time the Israeli government
has refused to recognize Palestinian terri
tories as occupied territories, or Israel as
a belligerent occupying power, conse
quently denying the applicability of the
Fourth Geneva Convention.
The international community, consist
ing of both governments and internation
al organizations, particularly the United
Nations and the International Committee
of the Red Cross (ICRC), has regarded
the territories of Palestine as territories
subjected to occupation by the military of
a belligerent foreign power.
Fhe Fourth Geneva Convention of
1949, relative to the protection of civilian
persons in times of war, is therefore
applicable de jure, legally obliging the
Israeli occupying forces to apply its pro
visions and provide for the protection of
civilian persons.
Unfortunately, the Israeli government
continues to refuse to recognize Palestini

an territories as occupied territories, or
Israel as a belligerent occupying power,
consequently denying the applicability of
the Fourth Geneva Gonvention. Israeli
attempts at justifying this position by
claiming the convention does not apply
because the territories were acquired in a
defensive war have been inadequate.
As stated in Article One of the conven
tion, the nature of the conflict is irrele
vant. Moreover, as stated in Article Two,
the convention applies in all total or par
tial states of occupation regardless of
how, where and when the occupation
occurred. Israeli actions violate the rules
of international law, especially the provi
sions of the United Nations Charter, by
assuming that there is a difference
between a defensive and an offensive war.
In July, 1999, the United Nations con
veyed a special meeting in Geneva which
passed a unanimous resolution stating
that the Fourth Geneva Convention does
apply to Israeli settlements in the "occu
pied territories." The participants reaf
firmed the existing international consen
sus on the de jure applicability of the
Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occu
pied Palestinian Territory.
Specifically (and these are verbatim
excerpts), "The participants of that meet
ing were unanimous in their view that the
Palestinian people had been subjected to
flagrant violations of their basic human
rights as well as their rights as protected
persons under Israeli occupation," and,
"The participants also expressed their
utmost concern at the continuing settle
ment activities, which include illegal land
confiscations, transfer of Israeli citizens to
the Occupied Palestinian Territory,
including Jerusalem, in clear violation of
Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Conven
tion.
The long and short of it is that even in
times of war, there are rules that apply.
Writing off the incidents MSAN publi
cized as the result of an ongoing conflict
is morally unjust and unfair to the thou
sands of Palestinians and Lebanese who

have suffered and continue to suffer
countless human rights violations at the
hands of their Israeli occupiers.
1 believe the best thing to do now is not
deny or ignore the past, as others may
have suggested, but to acknowledge what
happened and move towards a peaceful
reconciliation. Only by doing that will we
be able to overcome the injustices of his
tory and move to a peaceful future.

Stanford resident calls for Israel
to honor agreements
In their letters of May 16, Justine Fish
er and Gal Raz expressed their sincere
desire for peace between Israel and the
Palestinians, but they overlooked the fact
that real peace requires justice, and jus
tice has been denied the Palestinians
since 1947. In that year, the U.N. parti
tion plan allotted them less than half of
mandatory Palestine, even though they
made up more l than 65 percent the
population.
The subsequent fighting Was not a civil
war, as one letter writer claimed, but a
rout. According to recent Israeli histori
ans, the Palestinians put up only weak
and scattered resistance and, in response,
well armed Jewish militias systematically
destroyed hundreds of Arab villages and
forced their inhabitants to flee. By 1948,
at least 700,000 Palestinians had been
driven from their homes or had fled in
terror. Israel has refused to abide by U.N.
Resolution 194, which called for a return
of the refugees.
Since 1967, when Israel seized the
West Bank and Gaza in a war that former
Prime Minister Menachem Begin admit
ted Israel had started, Palestinians in the
occupied territories have suffered impris
onment without trial, torture, curfews,
border closings, house demolitions and
daily humiliation â€” all in the name of

Israeli security. Israel also proceeded to
seize nearly half a million acres of Pales
tinian land on the West Bank for new set
tlements, and divert 80 percent of the
water for use by Israelis.
Finally, in 1993, Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat signed
the Oslo Declaration of Principles, which
offered hope of a just peace. Israel
promised to release Palestinian prisoners,
withdraw from most of the West Bank
and Gaza, and make no unilateral
changes on the ground until the issues of
Jerusalem, the settlements and return of
the refugees could be decided in final
negotiations.
But those promises were never ful
filled. In the seven years since Oslo, the
Israelis have vastly expanded the settle
ments and isolated Arab East Jerusalem
from the West Bank with new road net
works and additional Jewish housing.
Instead of getting back most of the West
Bank and Gaza, the Palestinians gained
full control over only 18 percent of the
West Bank and about two-thirds of Gaza.
Meanwhile, despite promises to the
qontrary, Israel continues to seize Pales
tinian land and demolish Palestinian
homes to make way for additional settle
ments. More than 1,600 Palestinians
remain in Israeli prisons. The tragic vio
lence that broke out this week in the W T est
Bank and Gaza is clearly the result of
frustration and lost hope on the part of
the Palestinians.
Senseless though it seems, the explo
sion of anger should serve as a warning
that a peace process that brings no tangi
ble results is pointless. Real peace in that
region requires that Israel recognize the
legitimate and long-standing demands of
the Palestinians and begin implementing
its signed agreements, so that both sides
can begin building the relationship of
trust and equality on which their survival
depends.

qontrary, Israel continues to seize Pales
tinian land and demolish Palestinian
homes to make way for additional settle
ments. More than 1,600 Palestinians
remain in Israeli prisons. The tragic vio
lence that broke out this week in the W T est
Bank and Gaza is clearly the result of
frustration and lost hope on the part of
the Palestinians.
Senseless though it seems, the explo
sion of anger should serve as a warning
that a peace process that brings no tangi

region requires that Israel recognize the
legitimate and long-standing demands of
the Palestinians and begin implementing
its signed agreements, so that both sides
can begin building the relationship of
trust and equality on which their survival

Students offer ethnically-unrelated
perspective on Arab-Israeli conflict
This letter is in response to those criticizing the
display in White Plaza by Muslem students on the
anniversary of Israel's creation. As neither Israelis
nor Palestinians, we feel as though we can act as
impartial observers.
The War of 1948 obviously had horrible conse
quences for both sides, but we feel that the display in
White Plaza had a broader message than simply
condemning the acts of Israel during that war. The
display also serves to highlight the situation in which
many Palestinians currently find themselves, with
few rights and no voice with which to express their
opinions.
Furthermore, the display underscored recent
acts carried out by the state of Israel and the Israeli
Defense Force. One of the tombstones in White
Plaza represented those who died at Qana, a United
Nations installment in southern Lebanon that the
Israeli Defense Force attacked in 1996.
Those attacked included Palestinian refugees and
the Fijian soldiers working for the United Nations to
protect them. The United Nations stated that it was
unlikely that the attack was accidental as the Israelis
claim. Many other organizations, such as Amnesty
International, go so far as to say that the attack was
deliberate. In any event, over 100 people died as a

result of the attack.
We feel that it is important to have an open dia
logue about the issues in the Middle East. The
Muslem students were simply trying to raise aware
ness about the issue. We in the United States are
often bombarded with images of Islamic terrorists,
but there is little media attention paid to the crimes
of the Israelis. The U.S. government has an obvious
pro-Israel bias, as is evident in their foreign aid to
Israel.
To fully grasp the situation in the Middle East, it
is important to understand all sides of the issue. We
would support Israelis expressing their voice on
these issues as well, but we feel that sweeping the
problems under the rug in the hope of peace accom
plishes little.

Critics not justified in writing off MSAN
display as result of ongoing conflict
As one of the participants in Monday's MSAN
exhibit titled "Palestine: 52 Years of
Oppression," I think it is imperative, as
Justine Fisher suggested on Tuesday
("Students upset by display in White
Plaza"), that we frame the events that
occurred over the last half-century in the
correct context.
While we may all pray and hope that
peace becomes the word of order in the
region, we cannot forget or try to erase
the past. Just as none of us should deny
the atrocities committed by Germany in
World War 11, none of us should try and
argue that we do not remember what
happened in Palestine. Additionally, we
should have the courage to separate fact
from emotion and try to build a reconcil
able future together.
With that said, in coming to terms with
the history, I think it is important to note
that the state of Israel has waged a sys
tematic, institutionalized and state-spon
sored reign of terror Palestinian
and Lebanese civilians over the past five
decades. This oft publicized history is
precisely what MSAN wanted to bring to
Stanford's attention.
While 1 believe our exhibit successfully
conveyed this message, some in the Stan
ford community may by confused by
Fisher's Tuesday remarks that attempted
to condone Israel's human rights viola
tions by citing the ongoing armed conflict
between Israel and her Palestinian and
I .(jfianese neighbors.
JLet us all be clear on this. The Fourth
GttKeva Convention on Rules of War,
adopted in 1949 by the international
community in response to Nazi atrocities
clearly states that under no cir
cumstances, even in times of war, are the
acts that MSAN publicized Monday to be
tolerated.
This international treaty governs the
treatment of civilians during wartime,

including bystanders and civilians in ter
ritory under military occupation. The
convention outlaws torture, collective
punishment and the resettlement by an
occupying power of its own civilians on
territory under its military control.
A brief history:
On June 5, 19(57, Israeli military forces
attacked the neighboring Arab countries
of Egypt, Jordan and Syria. The invading
forces subsequently occupied the Gaza
Strip, which was under Egyptian rule, the
West Bank, including East Jerusalem
which was under Jordanian control, the
Sinai Peninsula, which is now part of
Egyptian territory and the Golan Heights
of Syria.
Immediately after occupying the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Israeli mili
tary commanders of each region issued
pronouncements accepting the applica
bility of the Fourth Geneva Convention
to the two territories. Three months later,
however, the two commanders modified
their positions to reflect a rejection of the
applicability of the convention to the
regions.
Since that time the Israeli government
has refused to recognize Palestinian terri
tories as occupied territories, or Israel as
a belligerent occupying power, conse
quently denying the applicability of the
Fourth Geneva Convention.
The international community, consist
ing of both governments and internation
al organizations, particularly the United
Nations and the International Committee
of the Red Cross (ICRC), has regarded
the territories of Palestine as territories
subjected to occupation by the military of
a belligerent foreign power.
Fhe Fourth Geneva Convention of
1949, relative to the protection of civilian
persons in times of war, is therefore
applicable de jure, legally obliging the
Israeli occupying forces to apply its pro
visions and provide for the protection of
civilian persons.
Unfortunately, the Israeli government
continues to refuse to recognize Palestini

an territories as occupied territories, or
Israel as a belligerent occupying power,
consequently denying the applicability of
the Fourth Geneva Gonvention. Israeli
attempts at justifying this position by
claiming the convention does not apply
because the territories were acquired in a
defensive war have been inadequate.
As stated in Article One of the conven
tion, the nature of the conflict is irrele
vant. Moreover, as stated in Article Two,
the convention applies in all total or par
tial states of occupation regardless of
how, where and when the occupation
occurred. Israeli actions violate the rules
of international law, especially the provi
sions of the United Nations Charter, by
assuming that there is a difference
between a defensive and an offensive war.
In July, 1999, the United Nations con
veyed a special meeting in Geneva which
passed a unanimous resolution stating
that the Fourth Geneva Convention does
apply to Israeli settlements in the "occu
pied territories." The participants reaf
firmed the existing international consen
sus on the de jure applicability of the
Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occu
pied Palestinian Territory.
Specifically (and these are verbatim
excerpts), "The participants of that meet
ing were unanimous in their view that the
Palestinian people had been subjected to
flagrant violations of their basic human
rights as well as their rights as protected
persons under Israeli occupation," and,
"The participants also expressed their
utmost concern at the continuing settle
ment activities, which include illegal land
confiscations, transfer of Israeli citizens to
the Occupied Palestinian Territory,
including Jerusalem, in clear violation of
Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Conven
tion.
The long and short of it is that even in
times of war, there are rules that apply.
Writing off the incidents MSAN publi
cized as the result of an ongoing conflict
is morally unjust and unfair to the thou
sands of Palestinians and Lebanese who

have suffered and continue to suffer
countless human rights violations at the
hands of their Israeli occupiers.
1 believe the best thing to do now is not
deny or ignore the past, as others may
have suggested, but to acknowledge what
happened and move towards a peaceful
reconciliation. Only by doing that will we
be able to overcome the injustices of his
tory and move to a peaceful future.

Stanford resident calls for Israel
to honor agreements
In their letters of May 16, Justine Fish
er and Gal Raz expressed their sincere
desire for peace between Israel and the
Palestinians, but they overlooked the fact
that real peace requires justice, and jus
tice has been denied the Palestinians
since 1947. In that year, the U.N. parti
tion plan allotted them less than half of
mandatory Palestine, even though they
made up more l than 65 percent the
population.
The subsequent fighting Was not a civil
war, as one letter writer claimed, but a
rout. According to recent Israeli histori
ans, the Palestinians put up only weak
and scattered resistance and, in response,
well armed Jewish militias systematically
destroyed hundreds of Arab villages and
forced their inhabitants to flee. By 1948,
at least 700,000 Palestinians had been
driven from their homes or had fled in
terror. Israel has refused to abide by U.N.
Resolution 194, which called for a return
of the refugees.
Since 1967, when Israel seized the
West Bank and Gaza in a war that former
Prime Minister Menachem Begin admit
ted Israel had started, Palestinians in the
occupied territories have suffered impris
onment without trial, torture, curfews,
border closings, house demolitions and
daily humiliation â€” all in the name of

Israeli security. Israel also proceeded to
seize nearly half a million acres of Pales
tinian land on the West Bank for new set
tlements, and divert 80 percent of the
water for use by Israelis.
Finally, in 1993, Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat signed
the Oslo Declaration of Principles, which
offered hope of a just peace. Israel
promised to release Palestinian prisoners,
withdraw from most of the West Bank
and Gaza, and make no unilateral
changes on the ground until the issues of
Jerusalem, the settlements and return of
the refugees could be decided in final
negotiations.
But those promises were never ful
filled. In the seven years since Oslo, the
Israelis have vastly expanded the settle
ments and isolated Arab East Jerusalem
from the West Bank with new road net
works and additional Jewish housing.
Instead of getting back most of the West
Bank and Gaza, the Palestinians gained
full control over only 18 percent of the
West Bank and about two-thirds of Gaza.
Meanwhile, despite promises to the
qontrary, Israel continues to seize Pales
tinian land and demolish Palestinian
homes to make way for additional settle
ments. More than 1,600 Palestinians

Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat signed
the Oslo Declaration of Principles, which
offered hope of a just peace. Israel
promised to release Palestinian prisoners,
withdraw from most of the West Bank
and Gaza, and make no unilateral
changes on the ground until the issues of
Jerusalem, the settlements and return of
the refugees could be decided in final
negotiations.
But those promises were never ful
filled. In the seven years since Oslo, the
Israelis have vastly expanded the settle
ments and isolated Arab East Jerusalem
from the West Bank with new road net
works and additional Jewish housing.
Instead of getting back most of the West
Bank and Gaza, the Palestinians gained
full control over only 18 percent of the
West Bank and about two-thirds of Gaza.
Meanwhile, despite promises to the
qontrary, Israel continues to seize Pales
tinian land and demolish Palestinian
homes to make way for additional settle
ments. More than 1,600 Palestinians
remain in Israeli prisons. The tragic vio
lence that broke out this week in the W T est
Bank and Gaza is clearly the result of
frustration and lost hope on the part of
the Palestinians.
Senseless though it seems, the explo
sion of anger should serve as a warning
that a peace process that brings no tangi
ble results is pointless. Real peace in that
region requires that Israel recognize the
legitimate and long-standing demands of
the Palestinians and begin implementing
its signed agreements, so that both sides
can begin building the relationship of
trust and equality on which their survival
depends.
