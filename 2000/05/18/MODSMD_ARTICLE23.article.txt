# Criticism of MSAN, display
## 
### 
Raz clarifies statements, calls for
collaboration and face-ta-face dialogue
In response to yesterday's letters, I would like to
clarify my statements in Tuesday's Daily ("Students
upset by display in White Plaza") that have been
taken out of context. I would never say that the
atrocities described by the MSAN did not take place.
They did. However, the display presented some his
torical inaccuracies, not by writing down events or
numbers that were incorrect, but by failing to place
them in context, through the minimalist nature of
the display.
If the purpose of the display was to protest by rais
ing awareness, it did not fulfill its goal. Awareness
requires information, and the display did not pro
vide enough, outside of shock-value. This is the rea
son I was offended — I felt that at a time where
Israeli and Palestinian leaders are struggling to final
ize a peace accord, this display seemed like a blatant
attack on the existence of the state of Israel, with an
intention to demonize the country and generate
negative emotions on campus.
My main point was and still is that we should focus
on a better future. This does not mean to forget the
past faults that occurred on both sides, but rather to
look beyond the death and grief to a new future of
coexistence.
Therefore, again, I would like to reach out to

those for whom this matter is important, and ask that
they join us in our continuing conversation via'the
Jewish-Arab-Muslim dialogue. I believe that only i'ri
a face-to-face meeting can we really get to under
stand the other side. ' - '.

Fisher responds to critics, stresses ' v 1 '
remembering all aspects of past
This letter is in response to those printed yester
day regarding the MSAN display in White PlAzh
("Students react to MSAN display"). I think that the
authors of yesterday's letters misunderstood' the
point of my letter. I in no way intended to label the
numbers in the display as false. Instead, my aim'was
to inform The Daily readership that there is more* to
the conflict in Israel than the deaths on one sicfe -+
not only Palestinians have died over the past *52
years. It is true that many Palestinians have suffered,
but once again I emphasize that Israelis have suf
fered too. I know this does not justify any deaths, but
I want to remind people that neither the Israelis por
the Palestinians are blame-free.
A completely inappropriate response
would have been for me to cite the num
ber of Israelis who have been killed in ter
rorist attacks since 1948. Although those
numbers would have been true as well,
tbey do not further the cause of peace.
.1 do not deny that we must remember
the past, but I think it is our duty to
remember all aspects of the past and to
put the events of the past in their proper
coiitext: a civil war.
Moreover, the comparison of my letter
to Jews getting compensation for the
Holocaust from Germany and from Swiss
banks is invalid. I am not making an argu
ment as to whether Palestinian refugees
should be financially compensated — in
fycfs 1 think they deserve some form of
compensation. However, that is an issue
for final status peace negotiations. It is not

the issue here.
Wrongs have been committed, and the
current negotiations aim to remedy the
past as much as possible, even though no
one can erase it. Once again, we should
focus on furthering peace. We must
remember, but we cannot live in the past.
Blaming only Israel will make peace more
of an illusion for all.

MSAN display ignores self-evaluation
After reading the caustic responses
offered to thoughtful letters by Justine
Fisher and Gal Raz, I wonder how exactly
the people supporting the anti-Israel ban
ner in White Plaza define the idea of dia
logue. Considering the sharpness with
which they attacked two moderate letters
to I he Daily from supporters of Israel, it
appears that they have confused diatribes

with dialogues and are far happier demo
nizing Israel than attempting to converse
with its supporters on campus.
It is hard to fathom how the Muslim
Students Awareness Network could be
surprised about the emotions which their
banner provoked. By its very nature, the
banner was not an attempt to address or
educate students on contemporary issues.
It was an unmoderated attack on the very
existence of the suite of Israel. By present
ing a list of "atrocities," "U.N. Resolutions
violated," and "U.S. tax dollars," the ban
ner and accompanying paraphernalia
implicitly attempted to label Israel as an
inherently criminal state. This was not an
effort at dialogue or education in the true
sense; rather, it was an effort to incite
anger and spread dogma by employing a
comically one-sided presentation of histo
ry.
All of this might be forgettable if it was
not part of a broader pattern on the part
of both MSAN and OASIS. While Nabeel
Ibrahim claims to have been committed to

dialogue, his organization has hardly dis
played sympathy for the views or feelings
of the Jewish and Israeli communities on
campus. Two years ago, MSAN and
OASIS — then led by Ibrahim — spon
sored possibly the most tasteless campus
event of the last decade, carting in a bigot
ed speaker who raved of various conspir
acies on the part of the American Jewish
community (including the then-unfolding
White House scandal) and openly ques
tioned the loyalty of Jewish Americans.
That same week, dorm audiences across
campus were treated to a dubious docu
mentary that attempted to tell the story of
the Palestinian people while omitting the
history of the Arab-Israeli wars.
Nor has MSAN's zeal for "revealing"
the troubled history of Israel's policy
toward the Palestinians been mirrored by
a commitment to ask if Palestinians or
their allies have ever wronged Jews or
Israelis. While they falsely label Fisher and
Raz as deniers, Ibrahim and Omar Latif
pay no heed to the fact that official texts

and presses throughout the Arab world
routinely caricature Jews as subhuman
and inherently evil or deny the Holocaust.
Nor do they address the fact that Israel
was the subject of repeated attacks by both
its neighbors and the terrorist groups they
supported. Mutual respect, Latifs laud
able goal, can never spring from mixing
denunciation with denial.
If the peace process is to truly take root,
both sides must engage in a frank effort to
understand the other's position and back
ground. 11 is lamentable that while Israel
is engaged in a deep and soul-searching
re-evaluation of its own past its opponents
are loathe to ask the same questions of
themselves. Until they can, and until they
make honest efforts to respectfully
address those who may not wholly agree
with them, they are in no place to fault
anyone else for the failure of dialogue
here or elsew here.
