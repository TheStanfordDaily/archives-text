# Criticism of MSAN, display

### 
Raz clarifies statements, calls for
collaboration and face-ta-face dialogue
In response to yesterday's letters, I would like to
clarify my statements in Tuesday's Daily ("Students
upset by display in White Plaza") that have been
taken out of context. I would never say that the
atrocities described by the MSAN did not take place.
They did. However, the display presented some his
torical inaccuracies, not by writing down events or
numbers that were incorrect, but by failing to place
them in context, through the minimalist nature of
the display.
If the purpose of the display was to protest by rais
ing awareness, it did not fulfill its goal. Awareness
requires information, and the display did not pro
vide enough, outside of shock-value. This is the rea
son I was offended â€” I felt that at a time where
Israeli and Palestinian leaders are struggling to final
ize a peace accord, this display seemed like a blatant
attack on the existence of the state of Israel, with an
intention to demonize the country and generate
negative emotions on campus.
My main point was and still is that we should focus
on a better future. This does not mean to forget the
past faults that occurred on both sides, but rather to
look beyond the death and grief to a new future of
coexistence.
Therefore, again, I would like to reach out to

those for whom this matter is important, and ask that
they join us in our continuing conversation via'the
Jewish-Arab-Muslim dialogue. I believe that only i'ri
a face-to-face meeting can we really get to under
stand the other side. ' - '.

Fisher responds to critics, stresses ' v 1 '
remembering all aspects of past
This letter is in response to those printed yester
day regarding the MSAN display in White PlAzh
("Students react to MSAN display"). I think that the
authors of yesterday's letters misunderstood' the
point of my letter. I in no way intended to label the
numbers in the display as false. Instead, my aim'was
to inform The Daily readership that there is more* to
the conflict in Israel than the deaths on one sicfe -+
not only Palestinians have died over the past *52
years. It is true that many Palestinians have suffered,
but once again I emphasize that Israelis have suf
fered too. I know this does not justify any deaths, but
I want to remind people that neither the Israelis por
the Palestinians are blame-free.
