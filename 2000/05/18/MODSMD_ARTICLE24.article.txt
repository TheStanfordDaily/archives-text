# The 						case for stopping out — and coming back
## 
### PETER DOUGLAS GUEST COLUMNIST 
1 stopped out of Stanford after my
freshman year, and I almost left for good.
Here's why — why stopping out is benefi
cial, and why coming back is even better.
During my first quarter, like many
freshmen, I devised a four-year plan —
you know, like Lenin's five-year plan,
only four years. I mapped out every quar
ter. After finally reaching the great
plateau of I he University, I made my first
great adult mistake: I planned.
Planning was clearly the smart thing to
do, the only definite means of assuring
my success and the acute meaningfulness
of every moment and every dollar of my
Stanford educational experience. This
was to be a "higher education," more pro
grammatic than the Soviet, more enlight
ened than the Wittenbergian. In four
years, I thought, I'll have a Bachelor's
degree in public policy and economics
and a resume packed with respectable
policy jobs and internships.

I really wanted to
spend my life helping
people improve their
lives. 1 thought politics
would be the best way to
do that, and that this
well-considered educa
tional program would
provide excellent
preparation. Despite

the fact that a public policy professor told
me point-blank that the department was
112 illed with greedy fcx)ls on their way to 120-
hour workweeks, failed marriages and ulti
mate burnout by the age of 35, I pushed
onward with my program.
I stopped out fall quarter of my sopho
more year to take an internship in the
First Lady's speech writing office. On the
first day, any suspicions I'd ever had
about the futility of politics were con
firmed when the program administrators
informed us that our internships would
be as substantially valuable as cashier
ships at Blockbuster Video, but at least we
could say we had worked at the White

House. In less than 24 hours, I gave them
my sincere thanks and ditched politics for
good. The only thing was, I was now
aware of how pathetic my plans had been
— and having stopped out, I had until
January to contemplate my mistakes.
Still, my perceptions of what Stanford
was and what 1 thought I would get out of
it were intimately tied to my compulsive
planning. Blinded by the failure of my
plans, 1 began to hate Stanford entirely.
You see, I had always wanted to act, and
during my senior year of high school, 1
applied to and was on the verge of attend
ing a conservatory when Julliard's direc
tor, Michael Kahn, convinced me to do
otherwise — lie argued that the best
actors he knew were always the best-edu
cated ones. Now, at home for the fall, I
felt that choosing Stanford had been a
great mistake, preventing me from pur
suing my passion.
Screw Stanford, I decided. My decision
to go there had always been wrong, and 1
just hadn't realized it. So 1 deregistered,
ordered the applications for conservatories

and began preparing my auditions. 1
decided to go back to t he Farm to have one
last l<x)k and say g<xxl-bye to my friends.
It was Big Game week. The campus
was alive with anxiety, hope, fear and
everything that makes it a week and not
just a game. At the end of that week, talk
ing with a friend until dawn, 1 realized
that Stanford isn't about plans and a lack
of passion. I realized that Stanford actual
ly gives its students more flexibility,
mobility and possibility than almost any
other school, and that if they simply love
what they do (like playing football), they'll
find limitless support on the Farm. After
six months away from Stanford, coming
back for a few days made me realize how
amazing this place is and what I would be
giving up to leave it. 1 stayed.
What have 1 done since 1 came back?
What's changed? That's another story.
Regardless, however, of the specifics of
my situation, the fact remains that stop
ping out was essential for me to ade
quately re-evaluate where 1 was and what
1 was doing. Removing myself from the

campus for more than just a summer and
seriously considering other possibilities
gave me the perspective necessary to see
the good in what I already had. No mat
ter how sure you are of what you're
studying, stopping out and taking time to
think things over, if it doesn't make you
change your plans entirely, will only
make you more certain of them.
Of course, I didn't realize it at the time,
but Stanford is one of only a few schools
where you can stop out pretty much as
long as you want, change your passions
and your major as often as you like, and
know that the University will support
you. And that's why Stanford's a great
place to call home, to leave and come
back to. It's also why stopping out isn't
just a good idea; it's virtually essential to
the Stanford experience.
