## Sorenson will be a name to remember 
### MAUREEN MULLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Dana Sorenson has her fair
share of humility.
"1 find myself walking around
campus and walking around the
athletic facilities in awe," said the
freshman pitcher. "I see all of
these big-name athletes, and I am
like, 'Wow, 1 can't believe 1 play
here too.'"
However, Sorenson isn't just
another Stanford athlete. In her
first season at the Farm, she has al
ready become one of those "big
names" that everyone admires.
Sorenson is a member of the
quartet of freshman pitchers that
have led the Stanford Softball sea
son all season long. While the oth
ers, Maureen LeCocq, Torie Ny
berg and Jamie Forman-Lau have
all pitched some big games for the
Cardinal, Sorenson has slowly
pulled herself away from the
group and has clearly become the
Cardinal's go-to girl.
"It is kind of scary, because
there are four of us and we are all
freshman and none of us have
pitched in the Pac-10," said Soren
son. "Then when you get used to
it, it is kind of fun. Nobody knows
who you are. You are a new face
out there, and you can kind of
catch them by surprise."
Sorenson has definitely caught
more than a few of the Pac-10
power hitters unaware in her
debut season, pitching her way to
second team All-Conference hon
ors.
She has quickly established her
self as arguably the premiere
pitcher in Stanford history. The
freshman pitcher has spent 15
complete games on the mound for
the Cardinal, notching a 22-8

record. She is closing in on the
Stanford single-season win record
of 24, established by Becky Blevins
in 1998.
In addition, Sorenson's 1.01
ERA is well below Blevins' record
mark of 1.24 and will undoubted
ly appear in the record books at
the end of the season. She has also
posted an impressive 148 strike
outs in 194 innings of pitching for
Stanford.
Sorenson's success at Stanford
has not come without years of hard
work. Throughout her high
school days in San Diego, she used
to drive two hours to Orange
County as often as four times a
week to practice with her club
team.
"One of my greatest strengths is
my dedication to make myself bet
ter," she said. "1 am the type of
person who will keep myself in
shape over the summer and never
stop. I always try to the best that I
can be in every aspect of what 1
do."
As a young player growing up,
Sorenson played softball in an era
when the sport was just beginning
to gain popularity. She was in per
haps the first generation of girls
that had softball role models to
look up to.
"Every little pitcher looks up to
Lisa Fernandez, with the 1996
Olympics and all," said Sorenson.
"I remember meeting her when I
was 13, and it was the biggest
deal."
However, while Sorenson con
tinued to improve her softball
skills, she also began to catch the
eye of her role model. Fernadez,
now the coach of the UCLA squad,
went to Sorenson's home for re
cruiting visits.
"Always as a little kid I wanted

to go to UCLA — during that
whole era of softball everyone
wanted to play there," she said. "1
was in awe when she came."
However, when the pitcher re
ceived her acceptance letter from
Stanford it) October, just before
the early signing period, she was
just as excited as any other
prospective freshman. Despite re
ceiving offers from both UCLA
and Oregon — schools with a
stronger of softball tradition —
Sorenson could not turn down the
Farm.

"I mean, it's Stanford!" she said
emphatically. "You have got the
best academics and the Ik-si athlet
ics. l he softball team is pic king up
momentum. It wasn't even a ques
tion."
The freshman pitcher has had
no doubts that she made the light
decision. In this season alone, she
has pitched victories against both
UCLA and Oregon in their home
stadiums.
