# No. 9 softball to face Chippewas
## 
### EMILY DRESSEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Taking a break from the West
Coast, the No. 9 Stanford softball
team (45-1 (>,9-12) journeyed to
Ann Arbor, Mich., Tuesday as the
No. I seed in the Michigan NCAA
Softball Regional.
Regional placements and
brackets were announced on Sun
day to 48 teams nationwide, whose
overall records, schedules and suc
cess stories deemed them among
the most talented in (lie country.

Selected teams were then split
up into eight regions and assigned
seeding, based on how they com
pared to the other elite programs.
Stanford's final destination was
completely speculative until the se
lection show this past weekend
when it was honored with a No. 1
seed, one notch ahead of its re
gional host, the University of
Michigan (4!^-14-1).
"We truly did not expect to he a
top seed,"' said head coach John
Rittman. "And, naturally, we are
flattered by it, but this is going to
be a very tough regional. It's an
honor to be No. 1 of course, but by
no means are we going in thinking
we're No. 1.
"Every team in the tournament
has post-season experience, and
we are going to have to earn it by
playing the best softball we know
how."
The Cardinal proved it can play
among and even defeat the best
last weekend, after taking Arizona
State in its final match-up of the
season, 4-2, and clinching a
fourth-place finish in the national
ly renowned Pacific 10 Confer
ence.
1 lowever, the road there was
anything but easy.
In fact, out of the 21 conference
games Stanford played this season,
14 of them were decided by two
runs or less, demonstrating the
brutal intensity of the Pac-10.
Besides dominating every top
-10 list throughout the season and
qualifying all of its teams to post
season play, the Pac-10 holds five
of the eight No. I seeds in the re
gional tournaments this weekend.
"After last year, I didn't think
the Pac-10 conference could get
any tougher, but 1 was wrong,"
Rittman said. "I am very proud of
how our team fared, considering
how young we are. With the ex

ception of two seniors, our starting
line-up is primarily freshman and
sophomores."
However, the Stanford Softball
players aren't willing to settle for
just a successful regular season.
They want to take the Cardinal to
a new level, the NCAA World Se
ries in Oklahoma City May 25-29.
The team was especially anx
ious to be in the Michigan region
in order to remedy its first loss of
the season, a brutal extra-inning 2-
0 duel with the Michigan Wolver
ines back in February at the Camp
bell / Cartier Classic tournament.
" We'rejust happy we get to play
Michigan again," said Stanford's
starting catcher for the last four
years, senior Kellie Wiginton. "We
want some revenge."
First the Cardinal must face the
No. 6 seed, Central Michigan
today at 10:00 EST. With a record
of 31-11, 15-5 and the Mid-Ameri
can conference championship
under its belt, Central Michigan
poses an extremely substantial
threat to Stanford.
As Chippewa head coach
Margo Jonker relates, "The talent
just keeps getting better year to
year. This season, the top 25 didn't
even move â€” there was nowhere
to go. But, the truth is, anybody
can beat anybody. And if you don't
believe that, then come to the re
gional tournament.
"Your team has got to play
great softball and, even then, that
doesn't ensure you"re going to
win. But, in my opinion that's the
only way you can."
