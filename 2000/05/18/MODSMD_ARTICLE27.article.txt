Today, top-ranked and de
fending champion Stanford (27-
0, 8-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
takes on No. 14 Northwestern in
the third round of the NCAA
Team Championships in Mal
ibu, Calif.
If the Cardinal gets past the
Wildcats, its path to Sunday's
final should be a fairly smooth
one. In the quarterfinals, the
Cardinal could face eighth

ranked UCLA, while fifth
ranked California looms as a
possible semifinal round oppo
nent. Both third-ranked Florida
and second-ranked Georgia are
in the opposite half of the draw.
"I like our draw in Malibu
and think we're in a good posi
tion," said Stanford head coach
Frank Brennan. "There will be
some great teams down there, so
we'll have to be both lucky and
good. We would love to defend

our national title."
Top-ranked sophomore Maris
sa Irvin, who last season reached
the final of the NCAA Individual
Championships, recently suffered
her first loss of the season to Fres
no State's Kim Niggemeyer, 6-4,
4-6, 6-2.
Today, onlookers will see if
Irvin has regained her champi
onship form since last weekend's
startling upset.

Irvin, along with freshman
Laura Granville, senior Teryn
Ashley and sophomores Lauren
Kalvaria and Keiko Tokuda, have
all earned a spot among the elite
32-player field of the NCAA Indi
vidual Championships, which
take place in Malibu the week pre
ceding the Team Championships.
"We were happy to get that
many players in the draw," Bren
nan said. "But before we look at
the Individuals, we have to focus
on the Team Championships. The
Team Championships are defi
nitely the priority."
