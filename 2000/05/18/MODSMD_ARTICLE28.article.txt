# Prodigy aims to be more than a shooting star

These days, most young female tennis prodigies
idolize brash, teen-aged stars like Martina I lingis and
Venus Williams.
Freshman Laura Granville, however, has a differ
ent idol: Lindsay Davenport.
Unlike I lingis and Williams, Davenport graduated
112 rom high school, waiting until she was 18 to become a
full-time professional.
Hingis and Williams devoted their entire child
hoods to tennis and were atop the professional rank
ings by the time they were 1 6. Davenport, on the other
hand, didn't make it to No. 1 until she was 2!V
Granville and Davenport have a lot in common.
Granville especially respects Davenport because she
doesn't bad-mouth her peers.
"[Davenport] has a down-to-earth attitude," she
says. "You can't tell that she's a big star. She treats
everyone fairly."
Both Davenport and Granville enjoyed stellar ju
nior careers. Granville, who won the LSI \ ( '.iris I8
National Ghampionships in 1998 and 1999. finished
her junior career as the top-ranked player in (lie na
tion.
Unlike Davenport, however, Granville (hose to
play college tennis.
"Maturity-wise, I wasn't ready to go on tour at 18,"
she says."It was way too soon. I don't know what level
the pros are at compared tome. ()ver the summer, I'm
going to try and play some smaller professional tour
naments."
Although Granville definitely plans to go pro at
some point, in the meantime, she is relishing her time
at Stanford.
"This year has been amazing," she says."I love the
team. Just hitting with the team every day has helped
me improve so much. They never let me forget I'm a
freshman, though."
Initially, Granville "didn't know what to expect"
from collegiate competition. She quickly proved, how
ever, that she could handle whatever her opponents
threw at her.
In November, she won the M A Regional Ghampi
onships. She then went on to take the lIA National In-

injury," Granville says, "because 1

had really been getting into a
rhythm. I'm completely healthy
now, though."
During her time off, Granville
continued to enjoy the non-tennis
aspects of college life, including re
cently joining the Pi Beta Phi soror
ity.
"I don't think there's much truth
to the stigma surrounding sorori
ties," she says. "It's easy to make that
stereotype from the outside. I want
ed to rush so I could figure the truth
out for myself."
College, however, has served not
only as a time for fun, but as a time
for personal growth, as well.
"It's a privilege to be a student
athlete here," Granville says. "Every
student is amazing in different
ways. You are in a bubble, though.
It's really easy to forget the outside
world."
Being at Stanford has been a cat
alyst for reflection on Granville's
part, although she doesn't know

what to make of her cerebral wan
derings.
"College is a time of finding out
who you are," Granville explains,
"and I'm coming to terms with who
I am. 1 came to college not knowing
what I wanted. I've learned that
nothing really comes easy, that you
have to work for everything. 1
mean, Stanford has opened up so
many doors. Tennis is just a part of
my life."
Tennis, of course, has always
been just a part of Granville's life.
Perhaps that's why she's so ground
ed and well-adjusted. A lot of peo
ple in Granville's position wouldn't
be capable of her genuine humility.
"The way my parents brought
me up," she says, "there was an un
derstood moral code. They did a
great job. They made sure not to
push tennis too hard; they let me
choose how to lead my life."
Because her parents have al
lowed her to make her own choices,

Granville's future path isn't clearly
laid out. She knows she wants to
pursue her tennis, but she doesn't
want it to consume her lile.
She doesn't yet know what she
would say to the public if she were
ever in the public eye. And she
doesn't know, aside from tennis,
what she's passionate about. But
she's ready to find out.
"In certain ways, I've been shel
tered," she says. "But sometimes it's
nice not to grow up too last. I'm re
ally normal, actually."
II she's so normal, how has she
become one of the nation's top fe
male tennis players?
"In order to become really good
at something," she says, "you have
to be a l)il of a perfectionist. You
have to be able to focus and give up
other things, and I was able to do
that. In terms of a tennis career, I
don't know where I'll be in two
years. But I'm ready for everything
that comes my way."
