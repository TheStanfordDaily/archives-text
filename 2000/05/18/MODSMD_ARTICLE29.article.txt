### MATT LONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
J Youthful talent will remain on
campus this weekend as the No. 25
Stanford men's golf team travels
wpth poise and experience to the
N{CAA West Regional in Madera,
Cjalif.
j Head coach Wally Goodwin will
entrust the fate of his final postsea
son run to a senior, three juniors
ajid a sophomore, leaving the
skilled but untested freshmen at
home.
i T he 14-year head coach will re
tire at the conclusion of the season,
afrd says he is confident with his
team's recent improvement.
1 "Practice has been going fine,"
Goodwin said. "We have been dri
ving with our tournament balls in
stead of range balls, and our dri
ving has been very good to excel
lent."
Long, accurate drives are a ne
cessity at Madera's Riverbend Golf
Coivrse. Riverbend is a short
course, and the fairways are wide
and open, inviting big hitters to
reach the green in two or even one
shot 1 on the par-4s. A few mis
placed tee shots at Riverbend and
a golfer will soon have an irrepara
ble score, considering the thick
jungle of rough.
A field of 27 teams awaits the
Cardinal, ten of which will qualify
for the NCAA Championships
held May 31-June 1 in Opeilka,
Ala. At the top of the pack is N0.5
Arizona State, led by the nation's
top collegiate golfer, junior Paul
Casey.
| Six other teams at the Regional
ate also ranked ahead of the Car
dinal, for a total of eight teams
ranked in the top-25. In order to
aittain a championship berth, Stan
ford will need to play its best golf of
t|ie year.
1 "It will take real low scores to
qualify," Goodwin said. "We can't
vyorry about [No.7] BYU, Arizona

State, {No. 8} UNLVor {No. 10}
Fresno State, because those teams
are beyond us right now. We
worry about the next echelon of
teams, like Oregon, Oregon State
and New Mexico."
Stanford has actually beaten all
of these teams except for the in
credible Arizona State squad.
1 lowever, these victories were at a
different time without the rest of
the season in the sandtrap, taking
a good shot to save par. Par is just
what the Cardinal will need to ad
vance in the postseason.
"It will be a great shootout,"
Goodwin said. "For a team to qual
ify they will have to shoot pretty
close to par every round."
Senior captain Dusty Brett will
lead the Cardinal to the tee. He has
been consistent all year and will set
the standard for Stanford's score.
Junior Eric Dahlberg has led the
squad in the last two tournaments,
finishing a career-best ninth place
at last weekend's US Intercolle
giate. He is on the roster but has an
ailing left wrist. The injury has
nagged the last two years and
Goodwin will decide soon whether
Dahlberg or freshman Jim Seki
will walk the links this weekend.
"Eric has pulled tendons and
has been taking some days off,"
Goodwin said.
"He deserves to go. He's been a
forthright player for us all along
and has put in a lot of time."
Juniors Alex Aragon and
Jimmy Lee will play in Madera,
each of whom is capable of ex
tremely low scores, but both have
suffered with consistency. Round
ing out the squad will be sopho
more Philip Rowe, who has not
played with the team recently but
has performed in practice rounds,
earning the trip.
"The kids will play their hearts
out," Goodwin said. "They've
been working hard enough; it's
just a matter of if we play well this
weekend or not."
