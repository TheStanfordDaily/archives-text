# Planning, development have been sources of Stanford-community tensions for decades
## Land of Plenty? 
### AMY L. KOVAC STAFF WRITER 
Editors Note .'Today's story is the latest
in our weekly series examining the is
sues and conflicts that have shaped
Stanford's relationships with the local
communities. This week, we look at one
of the most controversial subjects the
University is wrestling with today: de
velopment of Stanford land.

This summer, Stanford's Office
of Government and Community
Relations will issue what ii hopes is
the final draft of the much-debat
ed Community Plan and General
Use Permit application.
Since the release of the first

draft in September 1999, residents
of surrounding communities and
on campus have been debating the
future development of Stanford
land. Among the main concerns
have been housing, increased traf
fic and congestion, and preserving
open spaces on campus.
The current controversy over
the use and development of Stan
ford land comes at a time when
Peninsula communities are facing
many of the same pressures and
challenges.
Complicating Stanford's prob
lems with land use is the fact that
the University's 8,000 acres sprawl
across four cities and unincorpo
rated parts of two counties. Thus
the University is forced to negoti

ate with several different local gov
ernments with possibly conflicting
regulations.

ty Jo the University and how to use
t&at to accomplish the mission set
o)it by the founders of the Univer
sity," said University Archivist
Maggie Kimball.
v t'Leland Stanford wanted a
place where the University could
gjow," Kimball said.
\ According to Kimball, the issues
< >tfer land use are very complicated
because of the University's evolv
ing academic mission and the
overlay of competing governmen
tal entities.
H Andy Doty, Stanford's former
director of government and com
munity relations, said he believes
that concerns over land use began
after World War 11. At that time,
Stanford began commercially de
veloping part of its land by found
ing the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter, Stanford Research Institute
and the Stanford Industrial Park.
"Over time, the feelings of the
neighbors have intensified," Doty
said. "When the University grew
academically, they became more
concerned and they thought that
this expansion could harm their

quality of life."
" The interest has increased step
by step over the years. We are see
ing the culmination of that now
with neighbors wishing to influ
ence or control Stanford's acade
mic growth. The General Use Per
mit is the vehicle by which they can
express their opinions on these is
sues."
According to Doty, the first
General Use Permit from Santa
Clara County to Stanford was is
sued in 1952, but this permit "was
very general and quite vague. It
basically consisted of a map with
colored sections allowing certain
broad uses within those sections,
including student and faculty
housing. There were no real re
strictions."
Since the first permit, several
modifications have been made
that have imposed more restric
tions on the University.
The current permit, once ap
proved, will be in effect for the
next 10 years. University and gov
ernment planners are projecting
the future needs and challenges of
the University and the community
at large. As might be expected, the
process has been difficult.
"They have to project as best
they can," Doty said.

Kimball added, "Thinking so
far ahead into the future is diffi
cult. We need to understand
where we've come from and think
about how to plan for the future."
Palo Alto City Councilmember
Bern Beecham has worked on
land use and planning issues for
more than 10 years.
"You've got to do your projec
tions, but nobody's crystal ball is
very good," Beecham said. "Ten
years ago we didn't know that it
was going to be this way, but we
had to make our best try at it."
"Our whole perspective is from
here looking outward. We are part
of a regional problem, especially
when looking at traffic and tran
sit," he said.
According to Santa Clara Coun
ty Supervisor Joe Simitian, traffic
has been and always will be a con
cern for Stanford, but housing is
now the most important concern.
" The housing issue is front and
center in a way that 1 can't recall in
the recent past," Simitian said.
"For as long as I can remember
there has always been a certain de
gree of tension between the Uni
versity and the surrounding com
munities regarding land use is
sues, but frankly that's to be ex
pected," he said.

Kimball said, "I think over time
the community's view of the Uni
versity has changed. If you take a
historical view, 1 think that the
counties have viewed Stanford as a
good steward of its land and they
just want to make sure that this
continues."
Doty argued that Stanford is
opposed by a small but well-orga
nized group of residents.
"The surveys have shown that
there is a strong body of support
for the University," he said. "But,
there is always the smaller group, I
think, who expresses themselves at
meetings and in public forums
who think that the University neg
atively affects their way of life."
With all the controversy sur
rounding land issues, it is impor
tant to note that community mem
bers look forward to working with
the University to plan for the fu
ture.
"We don't make as many mutu
ally beneficial programs as I would
like to see," Beecham said. "There
are so many things that the city
needs and uses and that the school
needs and uses, that I would hope
that we would cooperate more. I'd
like to see much more joint work in
the future."

< >tfer land use are very complicated
because of the University's evolv
ing academic mission and the
overlay of competing governmen
tal entities.
H Andy Doty, Stanford's former
director of government and com
munity relations, said he believes
that concerns over land use began
after World War 11. At that time,
Stanford began commercially de
veloping part of its land by found
ing the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter, Stanford Research Institute
and the Stanford Industrial Park.
"Over time, the feelings of the
neighbors have intensified," Doty
said. "When the University grew
academically, they became more
concerned and they thought that
this expansion could harm their

quality of life."
" The interest has increased step
by step over the years. We are see
ing the culmination of that now
with neighbors wishing to influ
ence or control Stanford's acade
mic growth. The General Use Per
mit is the vehicle by which they can
express their opinions on these is
sues."
According to Doty, the first
General Use Permit from Santa
Clara County to Stanford was is
sued in 1952, but this permit "was
very general and quite vague. It
basically consisted of a map with
colored sections allowing certain
broad uses within those sections,
including student and faculty
housing. There were no real re
strictions."
Since the first permit, several
modifications have been made
that have imposed more restric
tions on the University.
The current permit, once ap
proved, will be in effect for the
next 10 years. University and gov
ernment planners are projecting
the future needs and challenges of
the University and the community
at large. As might be expected, the
process has been difficult.
"They have to project as best
they can," Doty said.

Kimball added, "Thinking so
far ahead into the future is diffi
cult. We need to understand
where we've come from and think
about how to plan for the future."
Palo Alto City Councilmember
Bern Beecham has worked on
land use and planning issues for
more than 10 years.
"You've got to do your projec
tions, but nobody's crystal ball is
very good," Beecham said. "Ten
years ago we didn't know that it
was going to be this way, but we
had to make our best try at it."
"Our whole perspective is from
here looking outward. We are part
of a regional problem, especially
when looking at traffic and tran
sit," he said.
According to Santa Clara Coun
ty Supervisor Joe Simitian, traffic
has been and always will be a con
cern for Stanford, but housing is
now the most important concern.
" The housing issue is front and
center in a way that 1 can't recall in
the recent past," Simitian said.
"For as long as I can remember
there has always been a certain de
gree of tension between the Uni
versity and the surrounding com
munities regarding land use is
sues, but frankly that's to be ex
pected," he said.

Kimball said, "I think over time
the community's view of the Uni
versity has changed. If you take a
historical view, 1 think that the
counties have viewed Stanford as a
good steward of its land and they
just want to make sure that this
continues."
Doty argued that Stanford is
opposed by a small but well-orga
nized group of residents.
"The surveys have shown that
there is a strong body of support
for the University," he said. "But,
there is always the smaller group, I
think, who expresses themselves at
meetings and in public forums
who think that the University neg
atively affects their way of life."
With all the controversy sur
rounding land issues, it is impor
tant to note that community mem
bers look forward to working with
the University to plan for the fu
ture.
"We don't make as many mutu
ally beneficial programs as I would
like to see," Beecham said. "There
are so many things that the city
needs and uses and that the school
needs and uses, that I would hope
that we would cooperate more. I'd
like to see much more joint work in
the future."
