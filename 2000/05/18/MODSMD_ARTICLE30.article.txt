# Rain saves Nevada from No. 2 baseball
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN STAFF WRITER 
So much for one last tune-up.
The No. 2 Stanford baseball
team took a long bus ride to Reno,
Nev., on Monday only to spend
the night and return to campus.
The Cardinal awoke Tuesday
morning to a forecast of consistent
rain and promptly cancelled its 2
p.m. contest with the No. 25 Neva
da Wolfpack.
The game will not be resched
uled, as just one weekend remains
before postseason NCAA action
begins — for the Cardinal (40-12,
15-6 Pacific 10 Conference), that
means Regional play at Sunken
Diamond May 26-28.
On Monday, Stanford was
named one of 16 hosts of the
NCAA Division 1 Regionals for the
fifth straight season and ninth sea
son overall. The announcement
automatically qualifies the Cardi
nal tor a postseason berth with at
least an at-large bid, regardless of
the Pac-10 final standings. The
winner of the conference receives
an automatic bid to the NCAA
Tournament.
"We're excited to once again
get the chance to host a regional at
Stanford," said head coach Mark
Marquess, whose Cardinal will
make its seventh consecutive
NCAA appearance. "We are ex

tremely honored that the selection
committee has selected Sunken
Diamond as a host site for five
straight years. We now need to
take advantage of the opportunity
and get back to Omaha [for the
College World Series] for the third
time in four years."
Out of each regional tourna
ment will emerge just one team,
leading to the Super Regional
round the following weekend.
While four teams compete at each
Regional, the Super Regionals see
just two teams vying for a single
College World Series berth. Sites
for the eight Super Regionals will
be announced once the double
elimination first round has been
completed.
The entire field of 64 teams in
the 2000 NCAA Tournament will
be announced on May 22 at the se
lection show, televised live on
ESPN at 12 p.m.
Stanford enters the weekend
tied for second place in the confer
ence with No. 3 Arizona State.
Both teams sit one game shy of
UCLA's Pac-10 lead. The Sun
Devils face Arizona on the road,
while the Bruins meet the Cardi
nal at Sunken Diamond for the
final league series of the season. A
three-game sweep of the Bruins
will secure Stanford at least a share
of its fourth consecutive Pac-10
title.
