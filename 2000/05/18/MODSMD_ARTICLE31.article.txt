# Media mixed in Stanford portryals
## 
### DANIEL MOREAU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Recent controversies — partic
ularly the University's plans for the
use of its land — have hurt Stan
ford's image in the local press. But
according to numerous journal
ists, the University's lofty reputa
tion remains intact among the na
tional media.
Most journalists attribute this
split view of Stanford in the media
to tiie different news stories that
the local and national press cover.
Phil'l aubman, assistant editorial
page editor at 1 he New York Times
and Daily editor in chief in spring
1909, said, "For the most part, na
tional coverage of Stanford tends to
deal with less heated issues."
"The Washington Post or The
New York Times, ABC News or

NBC News, are less likely, for ex
ample, to cover the extension of
Sand Hill Road than the San Fran
cisco Chronicle or the San Jose
Mercury News," he said.
Many in the local community
have expressed opposition to the
Sand Mill Road project, which
they allege would bring more traf
fic to an already congested area.
The project was approved by vot
ers in a local referendum two
years ago.
Minal Hajratwala, Perspective
editor at the Mercury News,
agreed that the national and local
media cover Stanford differently.
"Local media coverage of Stan
ford," she said, "tends to be more
thorough than the national press.
As a result, the local press focuses
on both the positive and negative
aspects of the University."

According to former University
President Donald Kennedy, "His
torically, the San Jose Mercury
News has been moderately hostile
toward Stanford."
In response to Kennedy's
charge, Hajratwala said that it is
not accurate to state that Stanford
is negatively portrayed in the
newspaper.
"Often, aggressive reporting
and intense scrutiny can be miscon
strued as hostility," Hajratwala said.
Much of the criticism Stanford
receives in the local press is due to
the fact that local media represents
the community, some members of
which fault the University on
points such as land use.
At times, the relationship be
tween Stanford and the communi
ty has been polemical. Hajratwala
said that "the San Jose Mercury
News reflects in part the commu
nity's voice, which feels very
strongly about certain issues. Cer
tainly, the debate over land use did
not satisfy the community."
Hajratwala said that certain
members of the community re
gard Stanford as "arrogant."
In addition, Assoc. Director of
Admissions Jon Reider said seg

ments of the Palo Alto community
perceive the University as "some
thing of a corporate behemoth."
Eileen Walsh, director of the
Stanford News Service, agreed.
"People often strongly disagree
on issues such as land develop
ment," she said.
However, Stanford also benefits
from very positive coverage in the
local and national press.
Taubman credited Stanford's
Nobel-Prize-winning faculty, its as
sociation with Silicon Valley, the
high profile of University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper and espe
cially its top-flight athletic pro
gram for the University's favorable
image in the national press.
"Stanford's successful athletic
program attracts a lot of positive
attention because of the unusual
match of a small, academically de
manding private university and an
athletic powerhouse," Taubman
said.
The local press also occasionally
shows Stanford in an equally flat
tering light, with regard to acade
mics or athletics.
Walsh said that "a lot of the cur
rent local coverage is positive, too,
particularly on academic topics."
