# Janitors seek University support
## 
### CHRISTINA LARSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Yesterday at 9 a.m., a small delegation of
Stanford janitors and concerned students de
livered a petition to the office of University
President Gerhard Casper, calling on him to
support them in their contract negotiations
with their employer.
The group of janitors represented about 80
members of their union employed by American
Building Maintenance, which Stanford pays
for janitorial services.
Although Stanford is not party to the cur
rent negotiation process, the janitors are asking
for a statement of support from the University.
Casper was not available for comment when
the petition was delivered, but his assistant,
Jacqueline Wender, received the document
signed by 50 janitors who work at Stanford.
"What we are trying to do is to improve our
living conditions," explained Alvaro Gomez, a
union organizer who accompanied the delega
tion.
Freshman Lolita Roibal, a member of the
Stanford Labor Action Coalition, said, "The
janitors are people; they should be treated with
respect because they keep this university to
gether as much as someone who makes ten
times their salary and doesn't have to work two
or three jobs just to support their family."
Â«Union janitors throughout the Bay Area are
now delivering similar petitions to the building
owners and companies that pay the contractors
for the janitors' services. The petitions are part
ofa "Justice for Janitors" strategy to build sup
port from diverse sectors during the ongoing
period of contract negotiations.
'The current contract between the janitors'
union and a group of about 40 contracting
companies, including ABM, is set to expire on
May 31.
| In negotiating a new contract, the union jan
itors are asking for a wage increase of between

$1.25 to $1.32 per hour per year for three
years, a medical plan without monthly pay
ments and more annual sick or vacation days.
Vice Provost for Facilities Chris Christoffer
son has previously said that the University will
not attempt to exert influence over the pro
ceedings of the contract negotiations.
He said that Stanford "is not party, legally
for] otherwise, to the [current union] negotia
tion process. As such, the University will not at
tempt to intervene in the negotiations."
However, union leaders such as Gomez are
looking to the example of the recent janitor
campaign iti Los Angeles, in which building
owners, politicians and religious leaders not di
rectly involved in the negotiations issued state
ments of support for the janitors involved in
settling their contract according to the Los An
geles Times.
According to Debra Zumwalt, acting Uni
versity general counsel, the concerns and re
sponsibilities of the University and the union
are distinct.
She argued that responsibility for making
sure the workers' concerns are addressed does
not lie with the University, but with the union
representatives, saying, "They're the ones who
have the responsibility and authority to negoti
ate on behalf of the workers.
"It would be presumptuous of Stanford to
say that they know better what the janitors want
than their duly elected union officials," she
added.
With the petition to Casper, the janitors are
hoping explain their chief concerns to the Uni
versity administration.
As the petition states, "Our main goal for
these negotiations is to gain wage increases
high enough to afford decent housing; high
enough to afford safe and reliable transporta
tion; high enough to afford to spend precious
time with our children."
"We believe our hard work should be re
warded. Therefore, we are asking you to sup-

port our struggle by paying enough money to
the cleaning contractor (our employer) so they
in turn can pay us a truly decent wage."
If the University did choose to intervene, the
extent of its possible influence on the outcome
of the negotiations is not clear.
According to Zumwalt, the University's
agreement with ABM regarding the price it is
willing to pay for services is not directly translat
able into a wage that it is willing to pay for labor.
When asked whether Stanford's stipulations
on price might put pressure on how ABM set
tles their contract with the janitors' union,
Zumwalt said, "Stanford negotiations with
ABM cover price for service, not labor costs."
Members of the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition point to the recent precedent of uni
versity intervention set by the presidents of
Harvard and Johns Hopkins Universities.
In response to pressure from local labor ac
tion groups, Harvard President Neil Rudens
tine and Johns Hopkins University President
William Brody issued statements of qualified
support for the labor campaigns on their cam
puses.
In March, Brody declined to sign a living
wage pledge; however, he did cite the universi
ty's "position to set an example in the city" and
pledged to support a hourly wage for workers
increase to be enacted over the next three
years. He described his commitment as "consis
tent with the values at the core of Hopkins."
According to senior Eli Naduris-Weismann,
a member of the labor action coalition, "The
key thing about that campaign [at Johns Hop
kins] is that their president has accepted that it
is a moral imperative that the university ensure
that its workers earn enough to live in dignity."
In October, Casper declined a request by
hospital workers and members of the labor ac
tion coalition to intervene in the contract nego
tiations between the former UCSF-Stanford
1 lospitals and Service Employees International
Union 715.
