# Corporate sponsors' $6.6M key for sports
## 
### MARK BOUCHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last year, corporate sponsor
ship of Stanford athletic teams
provided over $6.6 million for the
Department of Athletics. Some
people have voiced objections con
cerning certain corporate spon
sors, though, on the grounds that
Stanford is affiliating itself with
companies of poor repute.
Robert Carruesco, director of
marketing for the Athletics Depart
ment, said that the marketing de
partment reviews each sponsorship
to ensure that its product and its
message fit with Stanford.
According to Carruesco, NCAA
regulations prohibit sponsorship
by alcohol and tobacco companies.
The Athletics Department
doesn't want to "tarnish the Stan
ford name" by affiliating it with dis
reputable companies, said Debra
Gore-Mann, associate athletic di
rector of finance and operation.
She also noted that the Athletic
Department is "not autonomous"
in its decisions. According to Gore-
Mann, the University's Business
Affairs Office must approve all de
partment decisions regarding cor
porate sponsorship.
Classics Prof. Rush Rehm dis
agrees with some of the depart
ment's policies, saying that the Uni
versity should make "quadruply
sure that it's dealing with a rep
utable business." He objected to the
allegedly unfair labor conditions
under which .Asian workers pro
duce Nike clothing and shoes.
Although Rehm said that he
does not oppose corporate spon
sorship per se, he encouraged the
University to examine its sponsors,
such as Nike, and their business
practices more closely.
"If you're going to advertise for
[a company], you want to be sure
that it is better than reputable," he
added. "The Stanford name
should stand for something."
Rehm also said the prevalence of
logos on uniforms make the logo

and the corporation "coextensive"
with Stanford's athletic endeavors
and thus require some oversight.
"What has Stanford done to
make sure that [a Nike sponsorship]
is good for Stanford?" he asked.
Rehm mentioned that former
Provost Condoleezza Rice and
other administrators felt that in
vestigating Nike's labor practices
was not Stanford's responsibility.
Only student and faculty protests
brought the issue to the forefront
of campus debate.
Some athletes and coaches who
wear Nike apparel or use Nike
equipment support Nike's spon
sorship. One former athlete ques
tioned what would happen if Nike
stopped sponsoring teams' cloth
ing. She pointed out that the fi
nancial burden might eventually
fall on the players.
"Look at all the people who buy
things [from Nike]," she said,
adding that athletes' situations are
no different from consumers'.
"I don't know of anything that
Nike is doing that is wrong," said
men's tennis coach Dick Gould.
Gould added that an audit by the
consulting firm of Ernst & Young
showed the company and its sub
contractors followed a four-point
code of conduct. The code prohibits
underage labor, payments of less
than the minimum wage, worker
abuse and supports programs ben
efiting worker health and welfare.
Gould suggested that the pro
testors might be hypocritical in
protesting the University's affilia
tion with Nike when they them
selves wear clothing or use com
puters and cellular phones that
may be manufactured under
worse labor conditions.
He also said that if the University
wants to hold itself to a higher stan
dard in its corporate affiliations, it
should do so "across the board."
He feels that, if Stanford exam
ines Nike's practices, it should also
examine the companies with
which administrators or trustees
are associated as directors.
