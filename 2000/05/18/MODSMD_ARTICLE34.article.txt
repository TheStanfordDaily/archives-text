# Singer argues for morals over national loyalties
## 
### MATTHEW BLUMENSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
Citizens have (he same moral
obligation to help people in need in
other countries as they do to help
those in their own, according to
philosopher Peter Singer, who de
livered the first of two lectures at
Stanford Tuesday night before a
crowded Kresge Auditorium.
Singer, a professor of bioethics at
the Center for Human Values at
Princeton, will give his second lec
ture tonight at Kresge. The lectures
are collectively titled, "Our Obliga
tions to Outsiders."
"What 1 want to do in these two
lectures," he said, "is to raise issues
for democracy about those who are
outside the democratic communi
ty-"
The thesis of Tuesday's lecture,
titled "Obligations Beyond Nation
al Borders," was that "our obliga
tions to those in far-oil countries are
the same as those to our compatri
ots. In other words, we have no spe
cial obligations to someone just be
cause he or she is a member of the
same country."
While Singer acknowledged that
our tendency to favor fellow Ameri
cans, or family members, is under
standable, he challenged people to
achieve an impartial justification for

the partialities that influence us in
our moral decision making.
The acid test for moral fa
voritism, according to Singer, is
"whether [the acceptance of] the
idea that there are these special du
ties can itself be given an impartial
justification."
For instance, he argued that the
tendency to favor the interests of
one's family can be explained
through evolution, and we can im
partially justify this favoritism lo
calise the traditional family struc
ture has proved to be an efficient
mechanism. Fighting this partiality,
Singer said, would have more
harmful consequences than positive
ones.
Conversely, there is no impartial
justification, according to Singer, for
giving Americans greater considera
tion than we give foreigners of equal
or greater need.
"It makes no moral diflerence
whether the person I help is a
neighbor's child ten yards from me,
or a Bengali, whose name I shall
never know, ten thousand miles
away," he said.
The nationalized structure of the
world does not hold the same mer
its of efficiency as the family struc
ture, according to Singer. He ar
gues that preserving partiality
based on nations is causing more

harm than good.
Tim Fisher, a senior, said he
found emotive strength in Singer's
argument.
"I am convinced that we have
obligations to 'outsiders' and that
most of us tall short of fulfilling these
obligations," Fisher said. "His claim
that we must impartially assess the
value of our partialities ... was par
ticularly strong, to my mind."
Singer's arguments on this sub
ject have elicited strong support ill
the past. An article he wrote for The
New York Times Magazine was re
sponsible for over .$75,000 in dona
tions to Oxfain America, a charita
ble organization dedicated to fight
ing hunger.
David Anderson, a senior, also
said he found Singer's talk, engag
ing.
"I've often wondered what are
appropriate categories for in
creased moral obligation," Ander
son said. "Prof. Singer's talk really
helped me sort through these types
of issues."
The subject matter of Singer's
lecture was first raised in his 1972
essay, "Famine, Affluence and
Morality," which he wrote at the age
of 25.
Singer's lecture tonight is called
"Obligations Beyond the Species
Boundary," and will begin at H p.m.
