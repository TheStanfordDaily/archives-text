### DURANT GIPSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In spite of a change in policy
of the Office of Residential Edu
cation two years ago, fifth-year
seniors and co-terminal stu
dents are continuing to take po
sitions as resident assistants.
"Because of the severe limita
tion to our housing and our
Board of Trustees' decision to
guarantee four years of housing
for all undergraduates (two
years for transfer students), we
were forced to limit all residen
tial staff positions in 19 ( JK to stu
dents with guaranteed housing
years remaining," said Res Ed
Director Jane Camarillo.
She added that the one excep
tion is that, at most, 10 graduate
students and fifth-year seniors
can hold positions as RAs on the
Row and in the Suites.
Camarillo said that graduate
anil fifth-year students can posi
tively influence the dorm envi
ronment.

"There is always an advantage
in having an experienced stu
dent's perspective and maturity
on the staff of any house," she
said.
"Particularly in the Row and
Suites, where there are no resi
dent fellows, we find a great ad
vantage in that experience."
Alumnus lilake Harris, who
was a 24 year-old RA at 557 May
field two years ago, echoed Ca
marillo's remarks.
"I was an excellent resource.
My residents turned to me for
lots of different stuff,'' he said.
Kimberly Myers, a fifth-year
senior and RAin Toyon Hall,
said of graduate and fifth-year
RAs, "They've experienced the
Stanford campus a little more.
They know more opportuni
ties.".
Both Harris and Myers ex
pressed their displeasure with
the current policy.
Harris said lie hoped that
RAs want the job for the right
reasons, not just for the lions

ing. "fieing an RA is more than
that. Housing should take a
back seat to the goals of Resi
dential Education," he said. He
encouraged Res F.d to simply
"pick the people that are best
for the job."
"There's the potential of miss
ing some really good candi
dates," Myers said.
She added, "It was very incon
venient" to live oH-campus in
order to keep her year of guar
anteed housing so that she could
become an RA. "It wasn't my
thing to live ofl-campus and still
be a student."
Josh Schiller was an RAin
Lantana during his senior year
and an RAin Alondra two years
ago as a fifth-year senior.
He has noticed through his
experience participating in RA
interviews that there are often
amazing applicants among ju
niors and seniors.
"I think that there's a lot of
very good applicants out there
anyway," he said.
