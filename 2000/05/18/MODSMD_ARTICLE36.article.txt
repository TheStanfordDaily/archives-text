# Summer term draws students

### JENNY MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While most college students
look forward to summer vacation
as a break from the pressures of
academia, some use the time to get
ahead in their studies. Stanford,
along with many other colleges
and universities, oflers a summer
session. But, does the high price of
a quarter at Stanford pay ofl dur
ing the summer?
Stanford's summer session en
rolled 2,020 students last year.
Last year's summer session stu
dents included Stanford graduate
and undergraduate students, vis
iting graduate and undergraduate
students and high school students
enrolled in the Summer College
for High School Students pro
gram.
While Stanford graduate stu
dents represented about half of the
group, only 230 Stanford under
graduates enrolled in summer
courses.
"Stanford graduate students
tend to have full-year funding,"
said Roberta liassett, assistant
dean and director of summer ses
sion. "I think more Stanford [un
dergraduate] students would do
the same if financial aid covered
summers."
Summer tuition is charged by
the unit, starting at $1,878 for
three units and increasing to
$7,686 for 15 units. Since tuition

for the 1999-2000 academic year
was exactly $7,686 per quarter,
summer session could be cheaper
than other quarters if a student
took fewer than 15 units. For
twelve units, for example, the tost
would be only $6,254.
With no financial aid available,
however, summer session's cost
can deter students.
Lynn Shapiro, a senior, took
physics two summers ago at Santa
Clara University. She considered
the Stanford Summer Session, but
chose Santa Clara primarily be
cause it cost significantly less.
"It was a huge, huge [tuition]
difference," Shapiro said of the
cost of Santa Clara compared to
Stanford. "That was the main rea
son."
Many who do stay at Stanford
for their summer studies do so
largely out of convenience.
"Since I was already registered
as a Stanford student, I figured it
would be easy just to stay here,"
said Kam Jhawar, a sophomore
who took physics last summer.
"The timing worked out so nice
ly with Stanford," said Nandini
Gandhi, a junior who also took
physics last summer. "It's kind of
tough to coordinate times with
other schools because of our quar
ter system," she added.
The reputation of the profes
sors also influenced some students'
decisions about where to take sum
mer classes.

"I'd heard lie was a good prof.,"
said Jhawar, of 11is physics profes
sor.
"I definitely thought that our
teacher in Santa Clara was better
than the one here," said Shapiro.
Both Stanford faculty and visit
ing faculty teach summer session
courses, although Stanford profes
sors make up more than half of the
group, explained Bassett.
"The more advanced topics are
taught by Stanford faculty," she
said. "Especially in the sciences."
Most of the non-Stanford stu
dents who participate in summer
session come from peer institu
tions such as Harvard or Prince
ton, Basset said.
"This gives them a chance to ex
perience something completely
different," she said.
This variation of experience,
rather than a desire to have Stan
ford grades on their transcripts, is
a more likely reason for domestic
students from other universities to
participate in summer session,
liassett said. International stu
dents, though, may be drawn by
the Stanford name.
"Many foreign students come
here so they can say they spent the
summer at Stanford," she said
Overall, students who partici
f>ate in Summer Session seem
lappy with the experience.
"I got a year of physics in two
months," said Jhawar. "You can't
beat that."
