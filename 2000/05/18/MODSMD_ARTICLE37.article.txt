# Diversity in sciences urged
## By CHRIS CUSSEN 
### 
At Stanford and universities across America, the
1990s were encircled by an aphoristic commitment
to both racial and ethnic diversity and equal oppor
tunity. Now, entering a new decade, officials are
evaluating the current level of Stanford's commit
ment to these ideals, specifically in the fields of sci
ence and engineering.
Noe Lozano, associate dean tor student diversi
ty affairs, said she is pleased with the current at
mosphere, but said, "We aspire to do better."
I here is lots of evidence supporting Lozano's
enthusiasm: through increased funding, work
shops, tutoring and various summer programs, the
School of Engineering has demonstrated that di
versity is a high priority.
According to Lozano, "We are considered a na
tional model for minority education."
Recently, the National Action Council for Mi
norities in Engineering commended Stanford for
having "the best minority retention record for mi
norities in undergraduate engineering schools, na
tionally."
Furthermore, Stanford recently received an
award from the Quality Education for Minorities in
Math, Science and Engineering for producing the
fifth-best percentage of minority doctoral students
nationwide from 19H7 to 1997. Lozano noted that
most of these students came from the School of En
gineering.
While overall, students feel strongly about the
department's efforts, some feel that Stanford could
still do more.
Melissa Ghoston, a freshman engineer, feels
"Stanford didn't make as much of an effort during

the application process to reach out to minorities
[as other schools did]."
Ghoston said that colleges such as Dartmouth
offer weekend recruiting visits to minority students
to increase their interest.
Stanford otters travel grants also, though some
minority potential engineers "fall through the
cracks," Lozano said. He also mentioned the Engi
neering Diversity Workshop during Admit Week
end.
Ayodele Embry, a doctoral student in Electrical
Engineering, said, "People are always big to say
how diverse Stanford is, especially in engineering.
However, when you are one of two black females
out of 800 students, you feel that diversity may not
have gone far enough."
Provost John Hennessy commented, "One
could always do more, at the expense of not doing
something else. I feel we do a good job, both in en
couraging minorities interested in engineering and
in supporting them once they are here."
Motivated students have formed networks with
in their own communities to provide further assis
tance and support.
Three prominent minority groups for scientists
and engineers are Society of black Scientists and
Engineers, American Indian Science and Engi
neering Society and Stanford Society of
Chicano/Latino Engineers and Scientists.
Said Ghoston, "SbSE provides study sessions
and tutors weekly for its members and serves as a
strong connection to helpful resources, from schol
arships to old exams." She added, "SBSE really
promotes diversity in the School of Engineering
and encourages African Americans to excel in tech
nical fields."
