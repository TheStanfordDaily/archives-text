# Group to 'take back night'
## 
### ELISABETH PRESSER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Take back the Night, a march organized by the
Coalition Against Sexual Assault, will begin tonight at
9 p.m. in White Plaza.
Last year's mat ch drew between 150 and 200 par
ticipants, according to Kate Larsen, a junior who
helped organize the event last year and is organizing
again this year.
"The march provides a forum for members of the
Stanford community to protest sexual assault and to
recognize the strength of sexual assault survivors,"
said Kimberly Solheim, a senior who leads self-de
fense classes at Stanford and who also helped to plan
the march.
"It is also intended to raise awareness of and to
break the silence surrounding sexual assault issues,"
Solheim said.
both men and women are encouraged to join the
march, said Solheim. Last year's march was the first at
Stanford to welcome male participation.
Marian Hammond, who graduated last year and
was involved in organizing last year's inarch, said that
while the marc li is primarily in protest of unsafe con
ditions for women, CASA felt that it was important
that men take pai t in the event.
Hammond said the inarch "is supposed to be
about women walking alone at night without men to
protect them . .. but we're not going to be able to pre
vent [sexual assault] without male involvement."
Larsen estimated that 25 men participated in last
year's march. She said that the (week community was
particularly supportive.
Some fraternity members, however, felt targeted
by the route of the march, she said.
"There's no way of getting around this being a dif
ficult topic," Hammond said. "This has to challenge
people's comfort zones. We're talking about things
that people don't want to talk about."

Larsen said that while CASA does not want to tar
get anyone, she feels that the organization is being
asked "to do too much apologizing for what we are
doing."
Hammond agreed that "there's nothing to apolo
gize for. This is about stopping rape. There should be
nothing controversial in that."
Marchers will meet in White Plaza to create signs
and receive candles and pins, and will be invited to tie
ribbons on a Survivors' Fence to commemorate the
struggle of sexual assault survivors.
Last year's display was stolen. "We never found out
what happened," Larsen said. This year, "hopefully,
it will stay up."
The march will proceed throughout campus and
end in the Quad where survivors will be able to share
their stories. There will also be presentations of
drama, poetry, and music.
Larsen said that last year, "so many people came
up to me afterwards and told me how much it meant
to them."
Stanford Police Sergeant Rick Tipton said that
demonstrating against sexual assault is a way of "over
coming differences and stereotypes that have been
promulgated for ages and eons."
"The march is about moving from silence and
shame to surviving and strength," Hammond said.
