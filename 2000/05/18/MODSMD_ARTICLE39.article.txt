Problems at powwow
The annual Stanford Powwow last weekend was
accompanied by two thefts, three medical incidents
and several alcohol violations.
Sergeant Rick Tipton said that while the orga
nizers of the Powwow have tried to make the event
lessol a "party atmosphere'' and more of a cultural
focus, there are still difficulties in keeping the event
safe and legal.
"When you have a bunch of Outside folks come
in, they bring outside problems," he said.
Jewelry was stolen from vendors who had
brought their goods to sell at the event. The med
ical incidents were a seizure, a broken arm and an
injured ankle. Tipton described the alcohol viola
lions as "a bunch of drunks."
Stanford police were assigned to monitor the
event in addition to security brought by the Pow
wow organizers. "They've done a pretty good job
recently of policing themselves and cleaning it up,"
Tipton said.

Stanford students receive e-mail scams
A student reported a threatening e-mail on
Monday asking for his bank account number. Tip
ton said that the scam has been circulating for three
or four years and that other Stanford students have
received similar e-mail messages.
The e-mail is a "request for urgent business rela
tionship" promising to deposit funds from Niger
ian goods in the amount of $21,320,000.00. Tipton
said he would not expect any Stanford student to
lake the e-mail seriously.
He said students should treat e-mail from un
known sources with scepticism, "ft it's someone you
don't know, don't believe it."
Stanford police check such scams on the Web at
sites such as www.urbanlegends.com and www.ur
banmyths.com to see if they at e already well-known,
Tipton said. He likened the Nigerian business scam
to the popular myth (hat a student will receive
straight A's if their roommate commits suicide.
