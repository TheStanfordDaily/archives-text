# Casper reflects on humanities impact

### AMY CHRISTESON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Editor's Mole: Today's story is the second in a weekly
series looking bock at the eight-year tenure of outgoing
I University President Gerhard Casper. Each week, we
reflect on a major issue that has marked his presiden
cy. Today, we take a look at the programs Casper has
championed in the humanities and arts at Stanford.

Located in Silicon Valley, the heart of tec h
nological innovation, Stanford faces the temp
tation of focusing most of its time and resources
on improving its science and technological pro
grams.
While the restoration of the Bing Wing of
Creen Library could have gone unnoticed
alongside the new $120 million Science and
Engineering Quad, University President Cer
hard Casper said he has tried to prevent any
such oversights from happening.
According to Casper, Stanford has not
drowned in the technological tide. The Uni
versity focuses much time and energy on the
improvement of the fuzzier side of campus,
though these efforts often go less publicized, lie
said.
Casper, when asked about the large
amounts of money being poured into "techie"
programs, responded by saying these projects
are "being touted so much because that's what
the newspapers in Silicon Valley are interested
in."
He pointed out ways in which Stanford has
promoted the humanities, starting with the
Stanford Presidential Lectures and Symposia.
Begun in 1997, the series was created to "in
crease the visibility of the humanities on cam

pus and the interaction between the humani
ties and other parts of the University, in partic
ular the sciences and engineering," Casper ex
plained. "And I feel it has accomplished that."
In a retrospective document looking at the
program, Comparative Literature Prof. Hans
Cumbrecht, director of the lecture series, wrote
that he wanted to reassure humanities faculty
and students that they are not "at a University
which is dominated by the scientists."
Cumbrecht and Casper wanted to "make a
public statement . . . about the continuing im
portance of, and Stanford's commitment to,
the humanities and arts in higher education,"
Cumbrecht wrote.
Looking over the lecture series, Casper said,
" There is still a vast difference of opinions about
what are even the salient issues ... and [there isj
no consensus about which direction to go in."
Cumbrecht agreed, writing that there is
"nothing close to a consensus among human
ists regarding the general, present and future
function of the humanities and arts in higher
education."
Despite these seemingly unanswered ques
tions, the program served Stanford in other
ways.
Cumbrecht highlighted the response of stu
dents and faculty to the speakers' lectures. "Very
few, if any, of our speakers came up with more
than all-too-obvious answers to our central ques
tion concerning the future of the humanities and
arts in higher education,' " he wrote.
Instead, "the ways in which Stanford stu
dents and faculty reacted to our
events . . . were often unexpected and there
fore intellectually and institutionally produc
tive."

The program's organizers, who hosted a
total of 20 lectures on campus, worked closely
with President Casper, and also used the help
of faculty, graduate and undergraduate stu
dents in selecting the lecturers.
According to Gumbrecht, an average of 400
people attended each lecture, which may be
"unprecendented in the history of the human
ities and arts at Stanford."
The Presidential Lecture Series is making an
impression far beyond the Stanford campus.
Dartmouth, Johns Hopkins, Notre Dame,
Princeton and Vanderbilt have all contacted
Gumbrecht seeking advice on how to create
similar programs.
Casper also cited other ways in which the
University has improved that state of the hu
manities on campus. I le pointed to the restora
tion of the Bing Wing "as particularly a hu
manities resource [that] has been a very exten
sive undertaking."
While Casper admitted that the University
spent a huge sum on the SKQ, he said the Bing
Wing restoration has been "a humanities effort,
