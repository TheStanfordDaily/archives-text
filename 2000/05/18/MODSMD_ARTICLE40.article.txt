## A 						WEEKLY LOOK AT ARTS, ENTERTAINMENT AND STYLE AT STANFORD 'Redemption' deeply cathartic despite flaws 
### ZACH UDKO EDITORIAL STAFF

Venus Opal Reese's "Redemption: A
Collision of History and Memory in
Four Breaths" is more than just a play.
It's an event. Not necessarily an event
you will embrace, but a distinct piece of
theater that will have you talking
whether you like it or not.
Arguably the most ambitious new
work to grace Stanford stages in a long
time, "Redemption" aims to distill the
African and African-American experi
ence present and past down to an eco
nomical 90 minutes. For the most part, it
is a thoroughly engaging, meaningful
and cathartic work, encapsulating myri
ad issues while never preaching or talk
ing down to an audience.
Reese follows in the pastiche tradi
tion of theater, best explored by George
C. Wolfe in his plays, "The Colored
Museum" and "Bring in 'Da Noise,
Bring in 'Da Funk." But this ain't no tap
show or humorous tour through an
abstract landscape of African-American
portraits. "Redemption" is more bitter,
angrier and more explicit than any of its
predecessors, including Ntozake

Shange's "for colored girls." Reese never shies away from the
taboo, and the results are, well, shocking.
Graphic rapes (several, including one with simulated homo
sexual sex), talk about menstrual blood fetish and domination,

human degradation, drug needles and a disturbing
conversation between AIDS, Cancer, and Multiple
Sclerosis (dressed as babies) round out Reese's fright
ful vision of a country's racial divide. If Reese aims to
shock, she has unquestionably accomplished her goal
full force. But there is some validity to her perverse
theatrical displays, and while some moments push
boundaries, none are gratuitous. You can't explore

these harsh realities without the images.
The dialogue is coarse, harsh, ribald, shocking!) offensive,
and at times uproariously lunnv. Reese explores slave ships,
minstrel-coon shows, lile tor blacks in the Depression, whites

trying to break into black America,
and Africans Irving to break into the
same culture. She's ;it her best and
most effective when she makes use of
juxtaposition; a plantation slave rape
is set alongside a 1970s drug-induced
tape with the same dialogue. Ihe
parallels Reese draws Iroin history

are insightful, clever and quite powerful.
But there are key issues being ignored here. Instead of

bringing race into a debate about disease (where it doesn't
belong), why not shed insight onto some of the key con-

temporary turning points concerning America's racial
divide. The race riots? O.J. Simpson? Affirmative

action? Where is the black professional trying to
make it in the white world? And speaking of

whites, though one actor in this ensemble of
five is Caucasian (a very talented Pete Wright),
why is it that the only modern white character
is an insidious closeted homosexual business
man who picks up young black boys in bars?

"Redemption" could benefit greatly
from some expansion and subtle insight into
some neglected key points, perhaps even if
that entails an intermission and a second

act. Also, there are a few questionable
scenes in the narrative that are not told
with the same deft craft as many of the
others. A 1950s scene between a hard
working restaurant manager and her
emotionally neglected son (who burned
down the restaurant for attention) falls
especially flat. And most of the contem
porary vignettes could benefit from some
fine-tuning, especially when the lan
guage gets so lofty and elevated that it
escapes the characters.
The talent in this mounting is a mixed

bag. Performances range from the
extraordinary to the unimpressive. Jamila Webb deserves par
ticular note lor a broad range of highly vivid portraits, all of
which show oil enormous talent. Wright and Willie Duncan do
an admirable job with some of the play's less entertaining
moments.
Mark Guirguis has designed a multi-layered marvel of a set,
with sails and slave ship-looking compartments that roll out
smaller locales and Reese does work wonders on Guirguis' set.
I here is no doubt in this critic's mind that we will be seeing
much more of Reese in larger venues in several professional
productions to come. But before this ship ventures into rougher
seiis. it could use a bit of sanding-down around the edges.
