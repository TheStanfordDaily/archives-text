# A.C.T. messes up Marlowe's jewel

### JESSICA POWELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Neither wholly modern nor tradi
tional in its approach, The Ameri
can Conservatory Theater's new
interpretation of Christopher Mar
lowe's classic Elizabethan work
"Edward IT' proves to be not much
more than a slow-paced orgy.
The plot is generally faithful to
Marlowe's original: King Edward's
open love affair with a passionate
commoner named Gaveston has
alienated the members of his court.
While Edward ignores his kingdom
in order to delight in the pleasure of
his lover, his wife and courtiers plot
his downfall.
Although many modern inter
pretations of this play have claimed
that Edward's major faux pas is not
his choice to have a male lover but
rather that he loves a commoner,
director Mark Lamos has elected to
f<Kits on the Ibrmer, infusing the
play with overt homoerotic and
homophobic tones, and drawing on
San Francisco's gay culture to add a
twist to this take on Elizabethan roy
alty. The homophobic courtiers
walk stillly about in their wool pull
overs and leather pants (think Gap
meets Gaultier), and while they
scheme to undo the king they work
out in perfectly matching tiny tank
tops in the gym.
Nothing is subtle, and the audi
ence is constantly hit over the head
with gratuitous nudity, exaggerated
acting, and obvious ironic touches.
(Note to I.a ios: cliched symbolism
will not win you extra points; "Elec
tra"-esque allusions are overdone,
as are men with scythes before a
death scene ... and oh yeah, one
should avoid Jesus allusions and
crucifixion scenes unless the par
allels are really there).
In the same vein, it is hard to
sympathize with any character, as
all of the actors appear bent on
delivering their lines with such
booming voices that every word

appears to be a declaration of war.
The exception is Edward (played !)\
Malcolm Gets), who, although less
overwrought, is still an annoying
figure, not much more than a
lovesick and selfish fool. Moreover,
his supreme "spiritual" love for
Gaveston seems rather unconvinc
ing, as upon his lover's death he
immediately takes up with another
man.
Even more of a problem, howev
er, is the [>la\ s confused attempt to
mix both levity and seriousness: we
know we are supposed to laugh at
the courtiers' dance number to < ha -
cha music, but how are we really
supposed to react to the weird-look
ing Montana militiamen who are
hired to kill Edward?
However, to A.C.T.'s credit, the
sets are beautiful and simple, and
the lighting and scene changes ele
gant and well-planned. The use of
transparent curtains not onl\ makes
for smooth transitions from one
location to another, but also empha
sizes the lack of privacy within the
castle as well as contributes to the
ambiance of deception and hidden
motives which pervade the play.
Although a valiant attempt to
create an atcmporal rendition of
Marlowe's play, Tamos.s work ulti
mately falls short due to its choppy
transitions between humor and
drama, modern and Elilzabethean.
Frankly, it lags, and somewhere
between the tai r/fz-esque fight scene
and the* ultimate fall of Edward, I
lost all interest, and just wanted the
damned Ibol to die so that he could
011 in heaven.
