thai ges into
uncharted terri-

speed ol one of its
(earful carnotaiu s.

I he movie opens
with a beautiful scent

that follows the journe) ol .1

dinosaur egg (which contains the
unborn hero, Alatlar) from the nest where

it was abandoned to its eventual resting plate

many miles away, among a lainih ol lemurs. I "his
opening sequence takes ones breath away v\ith its
majestic landscapes and vibrant dinosaurs, and is charac
teristic of the entire movie.

One small distraction from the brilliance <>| the animation is
the fact that the plot is a trul\ lot tnulaic I )isnc\ plot. I he story
line seems to be a mix ol " I he Lion King and " l ar/an," with
a dab of "The jungle Book" thrown in loi a good measure.
Alatlar, voiced In D.B. Sweeney, is .1 young iguanotlon raised
by a family ol lemurs. When comets scorch the earth, Alatlar
and his lemur family are Ibrcetl to abandon their island and
swim to a foreign land. I here Alatlar encounters the first
dinosaurs that he has evei seen. Out hero and his lemurs join
the herd ol dinosaurs in their journc\ through the destroyed
remnants of the mainland towards the "nesting grounds," a
paradise untouched In the comets where there will be food and
water for all. During this join ney, Alatlar has main experiences
that every Disney hero or heroine seems to have. Ile linds true
love in a lellovv iguanotlon named Neera, voiced by julianna
Margulics. lie must stand up to the dictatorial

leader of the herd, Kron, voiced by Samuel K.
Wright, who also happens to be Neera's very
protective older brother. .And ol Course, no Dis
ney movie could be complete without the hero
out-smarting and oul-tnuscling die enetm (in
this case, thirty-Idol lull carnoiaurs who sialk
the herd throughout ihe lilni).

To complement (he incredible landscapes and breath-taking
light scenes, James Newton Howard adds an excellent score.
I he music fits very well with the accompanying scenes and
helps to cover up some weak and cliche-ridden dialogue. One
never expects to be shocked bv the eloquence of the words ol
Disney characters, and in general, this movie does not buck that
trend. However, "Dinosaur" does provide a small spark in the
dialogue by giving some of its characters vet\ atypical person
alities.
I "his comic relief comes from an old female brachiosaurus
with a high-pitched British accent and an old triceratops who
talks as if she is from the Deep South.
Despite the weak plot and dialogue, "Dinosaur" is a movie

which has digital and visual effects that are so
great that the viewer is able to overlook these
shortcomings. If you go to see this movie,
don't expect a si/vling story filled with twists
and turns, but do prepare to be completely
awed by the vast array of images that Disney
provides for its audience to feast it's eyes
upon.
