If we are to believe the liner notes,
" Tango is a song. Tango is a dance.
Tango is a way of lite." Now critic izing
a CI) is one thing; criticizing some
one's raison d'etre is another thing
entirely. However, il you can
approach tango from a slightly less
demanding angle, this Rhino compila
tion of tango hits isn't so intimidating.
"Bailemos Tango" is a chronologi
cal pass through the history of tango,
traveling from its early beginnings in
the 1920s to its most recent oflerings.
1 lie album will prove interesting for
tango afficionados

n
(those to whom that
"tango = life" thing
applies) as well as to
those with a general
interest in music his
tory.
The most enter
taining tracks on

"Bailemos Tango" are also those
which prove to be the most intricate:
the complicated piano work of "El
Niiio Jacinto," the multiple tones
taken on by "Flor de Montserrat," and
the haunting vocals of the abandoned
lover in "Que Falta Me I laces." Less
interesting are songs such as Retirao,
in which intriguing touches are lost
amidst overblown pomp, and sound
like they were co-authored by Ceorge
C. Scott.
The CD will certainly be well
appreciated by tango fans, as the
sound quality is impressive and the
scope of the compilation equally so.
And for those of you interested in
learning more

about the genre,
"Bailemos lango"
provides a great
introduction. But
be careful: tango is,
after all, so ninth
more than a simple
song and dance.
