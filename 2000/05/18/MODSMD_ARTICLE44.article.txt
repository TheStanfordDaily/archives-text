## Allen's at it again in crazy 'Crooks' 
### DANIEL MOREAU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
1 he moral of "Small Time Crooks" is
naive and simplistic: wealth does not yield
happiness. The movie follows a rags-to
riches-back-to-rags-again cycle. It is as
though the married couple (Woody Allen
and Tracy Ullman) portrayed in the movie
suffer a return to their original station in
life as punishment for their greed and
ambition.
"Small Time Crooks" is at its best — and
funniest — when Frenchie (Ullman) and
Ray (Allen) are depicted in their starting
social position, before they make it rich.
This is the milieu with which Woody Allen,
who directs, is most comfortable and famil
iar: a down-and-out couple who live in New
Jersey and who have only their wit, hopes
and dreams to keep them going.
Ray, a former convict jailed for attempt
ed robbery and now a dishwasher, has what
he thinks is a foolproof plan for a bank
heist. Ray enrolls the help of moronic
accomplices, which include a character
played by Jon Lovitz. They rent a defunct
pizza parlor, from whose basement they
attempt to burrow into a nearbv bank vault.

Appropriately, the idea is reminiscent of
the Three Stooges.
As a front to the heist, Ray's wife
Frenchie converts the pizza place into a
cookie bakery. Ray and his team have no
luck as bank robbers, yet Frenchie's bakery
is so successful that they turn it into a fran
chise.
We learn of Ray and Frenchie's new
found wealth through ;i mock "(i() Minutes"
reportage. Mike Wallace plays himself as a
hard-nosed investigative journalist, though
a thriving cookie business harcllv seems
newsworthy.
Ray is ill-at-ease as a nouveau ric lie: he
doesn't want nouvclle cuisine but cheese
burgers and Chinese food. With her prodi
gious wealth, Frenchie dreams of becoming
a New York socialite, "a matron of the arts,"
she says. However hard she tries to appear
cultured and refined, of course, she is
doomed to tackiness and _

had taste.
Frenchie hopes to
receive a crash course in
culture from David (I lugh
Grant) a debonair and eru
dite art dealer. She gets
more than she bargained

for, however. Aftet Havicl reveals his unsa
vory intentions, Irene hie bemoans, "I
asked foi lessons in life; I guess I realh got
them.' I lie sour kind.

Meanwhile, Ray is
so dissatisfied w it!i his new
life ol affluence that he
holds out for one last
heist. At a cocktail |>ai Iv,
Ra\ breaks into the host
ess' safe and pulls the old
switcheroo: he replaces

real with faux jewels. At least, that's the
plan.
"Small lime Crooks" portrays Ray and
Frenchie's — and perhaps Woody Allen's
— disillusionment with wealth and high
society. Yet the alternative does not appear
so attractive, either: a cramped apartment
in New Jersey, living on spaghetti and
turkey meatballs. At least then, Ray and
Frenchie hadn't lost the ability to laugh. As
with most of Allen's movies, humor's per
haps the saving grace.
