# Travolta's pet 'Battlefield' tests limits of terrible film
## 
### LAUREN RUSSELL EDITORIAL STAFF 
With the release of Pulp Fiction in 1994,
John Travolta was abruptly re-catapulted into
the realm of super-stardom. He followed that
performance with a variety of roles (some more
successful than others) but it was clear that he
offered something that audiences wanted to see.
And then he made "Battlefield Earth." God only
knows what was going through his head when
he described his latest project as possessing "tal
ent that was unsurpassed." Maybe I just missed
it.
A heinously stupid sci-fi-action-shoot-em-up,
Battlefield Earth takes place in the year 3000
AD, when human beings are more or less an
endangered species clawing for survival on a
planet they once dominated. Somewhere along
the line, an alien race called Psychlos attacked
earth and all but exterminated humanity in
under 10 minutes. Since the invasion, human
society has degenerated to a Cro-Magnon level
of sophistication. Humans run around wearing
animal skins and face paint but speak perfectly
articulate and unbroken English. But that's
beside the point.
1 like science fiction movies. I like action
movies. I promote the suspension of disbelief
when watching films that aren't supposed to be
plausible. But "Battlefield Earth" is just plain
stupid. It's not even salvaged by its reasonably
entertaining special effects. The "plot" (I use the
word loosely) follows the story of an impetuous
human youth named Jonnie (Barry Pepper)
who is determined to win back (he honor of the
human race and rid them of their Psychlo over
lords forever. During his eager journey from the
seclusion of the Colorado mountains, he is cap
tured by a Psychlo patrol and taken to a mining
facility which seems to be the only alien
stronghold on the entire planet.
Humans and Psychlos alike are apparently
exploited and used for manual labor at this
installation and everyone seems to be pretty
unhappy with their predicament. Terl ( Travol
ta) the scheming head of security. After finding
out he is to stay on the hideous planet earth
indefinitely (he was expecting a transfer), lerl
decides that he's going to use the "man animals"
under his supervision to mine gold in order to
make the best of his dismal situation. This is
where the movie completely de-rails and hope
lessly careens towards a ridiculous conclusion
that is completely embarassing to watch.
Up to this point the movie is marginally
entertaining. The dialogue is bad and the Psy
chlos basically look like 7 foot rastas in platform
ski boots. (The chase scenes are pretty funny,
since you're supposed to believe that the Psych
los can run reeeeally fast despite their fifty
pound footwear).
In order to mine his gold, Terl apparently
deems it necessary to teach the most intelligent
human (Pepper) the entire history of the Psych
lo civilization including Earth's history,
advanced physics and mathematics, chemistry,
aeronautics, nuclear science, ballistics, weapons

and tactics, chemistrv, and a host of other seem
ingly mundane tidbits ol information. I his
entire process takes about f> da\s with the use ol
a sophisticated "learning machine" which essen
tially inserts knowledge into the hapless
hitman's brain.
With bis newly acquired knowledge, |onnie
decides to rally all 150 of the humans be has
contact with in order to destro) the I'sychlo
homeworld and the entirety ol its inhabitants.
Wow. I bat's not bad lor a guy who started the
movie eating raw animals and biding out tit
caves.
All sarcasm aside, 1 thought I was going to
enjoy this movie, even if it didn't live up to the
critics' expectations. But when the audience |iist
started cracking up thirty seconds into the lilin,
before any dialogue had taken place, I knew it
was a loser. Travolta is annoying and I'eppei
attempts to be energetic and animated but ends
up looking like a moron. Serious science lit lion
fans may be able to salvage something positive
from this colossal einbarassment; the special
effects are pretty good and there are a bnn< li of
satisfying explosions towards the end. I pet son
ally hope that I ravolta s next project re-estab
lishes him as competent and entertaining ac tor.
I normally enjoy his work. II you're debating
what to see this weekend, leave Battlefield I'.aith
off your list.
