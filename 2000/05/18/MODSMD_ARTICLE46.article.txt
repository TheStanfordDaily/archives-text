# 'Road Trip' has sex, lies and even some videotape

Stanford students will sec what tun they're missing — as well as what's amiss —
in the way "Road Trip" depicts college life. The impetuosity with which a group
of friends embarks on a road trip from Ithaca to Austin is hard to believe, and
the 1 rat party scene is 100 well choreographed and too brightly lit for Stanford
standards.
This is familiar territory, however, for director and screenwriter Todd Phillip,
whose previous movie "I rat 1 louse" won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance
Film Festival in l l »8.
Sel at the fictional University of Ithaca, "Road Trip" starts when Josh (played
by Breckin Meyer) videotapes himself cheating on his girl friend Tiffany (Rachael

Blanchar) who goes to
school in Austin. Texas. Josh
accidentally sends this tape
to Tiffany. Hence, a road
trip, whose mission is inter
cepting the tape in Austin
before Tiffany can see it.
Josh brings along for the
ride E.L. (Sean W. Scott
who virtually plays the same
character that he did in
"American Pie": the obnox
ious and libidinous jock
Stickler); Rubin (Paulo
Costanzo) the brainiest of
the bunch; and last but not
least, Kyle (D.J. Quails) the
indispensable dork who pro
vides the butt of most of the
jokes.
Unfortunately, the funni
est character Barry (Tom
Green of MTV fame) does
not go on the road trip.
Instead, Barry stays behind,
in order to take care of
Rubin's pet boa constrictor.
Barry is obsessed with feed
ing the snake: he turns the
feeding into a ritual sacrifice.
When the boa won't eat the
rodent, Barrv mouths the

entire mouse himself in order to encourage the snake.
Barry also narrates the movie, however clumsily, as he gives a campus tour. The
movie plays on the unreliability of Barry as a narrator. Indeed, some of the movie
is purely Barry's fantasy. ()ne scene depicts the inside of the girls' showers, where
well-endowed women casually change in front of each other. A girl on the tour
reminds Barry, however, that girls don't walk around topless in front of each
other. I'hus. Barry's fantasy shatters.
"Road I rip," after an emergency change of vehicles, makes stops at an eerie
motel run by ;i creepy concierge played by Andy Dick; an African-American fra
ternity; Barry's parents' house and a sperm hank, where the macho E.L. discov
ers the pleasures of anal sex.
In addition to having a good time, these friends make good mileage on the road
to sell-discovery: Josh learns another lesson in love; the anxious and ill-at-ease

Rubin finally mellows out; ELL. expands
his sexual horizons; and Kyle comes this
much closer to becoming cool.
As finals loom, there's one lesson Stan
ford students are sure to take from "Road
Trip"; nothing beats stress like a classic
college road trip.
