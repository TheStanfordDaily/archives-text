# Galactic has a very solid 'Future'
## 
### STEVEN RAPHAEL STAFF WRITER 
On their newest release, New
Orleans funkers Galactic ma\ be
"Late for the Future," but
they're just in time lor their best
alburn to date, showing their
growth and maturity as a band.
Much of the credit goes to the
two bandineinbcrs whose per
formance has markedly
improved. My vote for most
improved musician goes to gui
tarist Jeff Raines, the former
weak link of the band. At long
last, Raines has gained the abili
ty to play more than generic
blues licks, as well as the knowl
edge of when to just lay back
and play rhythm guitar.
Also improved is sax man Ben
Fllman, who has finally stepped
forward to take his proper plate
as the lead instruinent of tlie
group. I lis sax solos scream
emotive power, while his har
monica playing adds a nice twist
to many of the songs.
Sadly, drummei Stanton
Moore is less prominent on
"Late" than on the group's two
previous recordings. Moore's
compositions, such as l99K's

"Witchdoctor," rank among the
best drum-driven songs ol all
time, and it's a pity that none
are included on this album.
Net, the added exploration by
the group more than makes up
for it. Moving beyond strict

funk, the group encorporates
both New Orleans parade music
and kle/mer into their style with
noteworthy results. "Late for
the Future" lirmly establishes
Galactic as a band that is only
getting better with time.
