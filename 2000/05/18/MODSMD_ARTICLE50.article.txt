I lie new release by these guys is a mix of'hip-hop, groove-funk, hard
tore lock and alternative. Ii lias a nice rough sound to it and the lyrics
are really good. Basically, Papa Roach's new cd "Infested" is great! Issued
bv Dream Works Records and produced by Jay Bautngardner, the band
— (oby Shaddix , David Buckner, Tobin Ksperance and Jerry Horton —
have a solid punk effort on theii hands.
1 he title track "Infest" has a hip-hop foundation with a hardcore rock
sound. This song at first takes some getting used to because the pairing
doesn't quite seem natural but listening to it for a second time it becomes
apparent that this blending works for this group. It is carried off with
success. Ihe other tracks, as well, reflect the skill of these musical artis
tic giants especially in "Revenge" and "Thrown Away."
The musicians play with listener expectation in each of their songs.
They add some very nice sonic mixes when you least expect it. For the

most pari, this is accomplished
through some fantastic bass work by
Tobin.
"Infested" is capable of attracting, a
myriad of different types of music
crowds because of the diversity of
sounds they incorporate into their
work. "Infest" won't disappoint!
