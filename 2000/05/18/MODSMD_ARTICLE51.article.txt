York, the technical superi
ority of the quartet cannot
be ([uestioned and LA(iQ
does ;i fine job of presenting
the material. Unfortunately.

the in 11 sic on this record
falls mostly into the category of "eleva

notwithstanding.
fhe selections included in this
record are by guitarists / composers
Carlos Rafael Rivera, Morten Laurid
seti, Benjamin Verdery and Sergio
Assad, as well as LACQ members York,
Tennant and Kanengiser. I he record
melds elements of Celtic, Asian and

Lai in music into the original composi
tions, creating a varied listening expe
rience. Ihe lew songs worth mention
ing are Rivera's "Cumba-Quin," in
which (lie quartet uses the body of the
guitar to imitate the sounds of percus
sion instruments such as the conga and
( laves. Verdery's "Ellis Island," which
features the infrequent practice of
bowing the guitar, and Lauridsen's

"l)irait-()n," which soothes
the auditory senses with its
smoothness. In addition,
York's "Lotus Eaters," a
pleasing, mellow, easy-lis
tening piece, contrasts nic e
ly with the exoticism of his
"(Ask the) Sphinx."
However, York's final
composition on this record,
"Along the Edge," is over
drawn and plaintive. Ihe
trio of songs entitled,
"Celtic Fare" is repetitive
and numbing. Often, the
songs blend into the follow
ing selections, indistin
guishable from each other.
These songs represent the
wasted talent of LAGQ, as
their talented members
could have done much
more by recording more
songs like the compositions
of Rivera and Verdery.
On the whole, this
record is acceptable for
casual listening as back
ground music , but if you're

looking for a more substantive musical
listening experience, look elsewhere.
