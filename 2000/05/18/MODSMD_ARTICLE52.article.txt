# Common's 'Chocolate' has very unusual taste
## 
### MARC SCOPETTONE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sometimes you jusl want to like an album more
than its content merits. Like when an artist offers a
completely anomalous and confounding record,
such as Beck with "Mutations," and yet you cannot
find it, in yourself to be adequately critical out of
respect for the artist. "Like Water for Chocolate,"
Chicago MC Common's fourth album, is such a
record.
On "Resurrection" and "One Day It'll All Make
Sense, Common defined a conscious sound, deliv
ering deft lyrics over equally impressive tracks laid
down by his right-hand men. No I.D. and Dug Inf.
I hey were the Pete Rock to Common's CL Smooth.
Encouraging responsibility without being preachy,
Common's message rose above the sea of immatu
rity that perpetually threatens to

drown hip hop. This time around.
Common abandons hometown
friends No I.D. and Dug Inf, turn
ing over the reigns to ?uestlove of
the Roots, Jay Dee, and D'Angelo
(collectively known as the
Soulquarians). The result is an
album that sounds like a hybrid of.

well, The Roots' "Things Fall Apart" and D'Ange
lo's "Voodoo."
Ironically, the crown jewel of "Like Water for
Chocolate" is the only track not produced by the
Soulquarians, the DJ Premier-laced "The Sixth
Sense." It feels like a culmination of a cultural jour
ney, replete with joy, pain and reflection, all in four
minutes: "The perseverance of a rebel/ I drop heav
ier levels/ That's unseen or heard/ A king with
words/ Can't knock the hustle but I've seen street
dreams deferred/ Dark spots in my mind where the
scene occurred."
Other bright spots include the requisite love song.
"The Light," the rapid-fire "Heat," and "Dooinit."
with a bouncy southern beat courtesy of Jay Dee.
Given the recent success of jazzy, band-oriented
hip hop (like the Roots), it is questionable that
Common has suddenly embraced this new sound.
Perhaps he feels he has outgrown his ('hi-town com-

patriots. Still. Common is lyri
cally sharp as ever, leaving the
listener to uncover new witti
cisms with each listen. "Like
Water for Chocolate" is an
extremely well-executed album.
It just isn't a Common album.
And vet I love it all the same.
