# Grungy Mouse rocks

### LUKE MINER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It seems that with every new album. Modest
Mouse substantially changes its sound.
"Interstate 8" is a sad voyage into love, lone
liness and depression. Dissonant and rockin*.
" The Lonesome Crowded West" is a radical
departure Irom the previous album, relying
heavily upon Isaac Brock's twangy, north
western. trailer park voice. Thus, it comes as
little surprise that Modest Mouse's latest
release, "The Moon and Antarctica," repre
sents yet another turn away from the band's
past. Much more polished than their previous
albums, this moodv and contemplative reflec
tion into the nature of insanity is their most
accessible release to date.
" The Moon and Antarctica" is produced by
Brian Deck (member of Red Red Meat and
co-owner of a studio with Tortoise's Jon
McEntire) and his influence is evident

throughout the album. Like
an expert diamond cutter.
Deck has smoothed away
Modest Mouse's rougher
edges. The drums, once the
driving force behind the
band, have been significant!v

toned clown, and the bass is now almost
inaudible. In their place is Isaac Brock's sim
ple yet competent guitar playing, which has
been beefed up through the use of layering.
Most of the time this new formula seems to
work, but occasionally it falls a little flat.
Brock is far from a guitar virtuoso, and with
out the drums to hide behind his solos on a
few songs seem dull and pointless.
The highlight of "The Moon and Antarcti
ca' is the singing. Combining a northwest
hillbilly sensibility with good old-fashioned
indie rock. Brock has one of the most original
and interesting voices in rock music today.
Constantly oscillating between high-pitched
angst and baritone snarls his voice has the
power both to emote and excite.
The only real problem with "The Moon and
Antarctica" is the consistency. Modest Mouse
produces a few gems ("Gravity Rides Every
thing" and "A Different City") but also a few
losers ("Tiny Cities Made of Ashes"). Still the

good songs heavily out
weigh the bad ones. This is
by far the best album I've
heard all year. If you like
grunge rock, you'll love
"The Moon and Antarcti
ca."
