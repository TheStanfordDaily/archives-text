When I was twelve years old, 1 had an unfor
tunate encounter with a light bulb in mv room.
While I was away .it school that dav, the glass part
ol the I )iiII> had fallen out, leaving the metal por
tion wedged in place. I naware of the laws of elec
tric il\ I tried to remove the bottom of the bulb
with ;i pair of pliers. In that brief instant enough
eleciricitx to kill a large dog coursed through in\
bod\. II votive evei been electrocuted belbre, you
know ii is one ol the most painful experiences

known to man. And yet not even
ibis compares to pain I fell while
listening to Alphaville's new album
"Salvation."
Everything about the experi
ence was excruciating. I lie lead
singer s voice, sounding like a mix
between INXS and Robert Palmer,

caused a sharp and constant throb in mv temples
punctuated In the uncontrollable flutter of my eye
lid. I he beats, repetitive and slimy, hi) me in the
stomach, making me buckle over in pain. The syn
thesizer dealt the finishing blow. Its sugar) manip
ulative nature proved too much, sending me into
uncontrollable spasms on the floor of my room.
Attempting to adapt their 80s s\ nth-pop roots
to a contemporary music context, Alphaville lias
managed to take the worst of the 80s (Top (.11 11-
esque melodies that sound like " lake Mv Breath
Away") and combine it with the worst of the
nineties (happy hardcore). I here is absoluteh

nothing redeeming about
Alphax ille except theii name (a
reference to a camp\ French
sci-li film from the '60s). II
Jean Luc Godard knew the\
were using his movie to sell
their horrible music, he'd
probably sue.
