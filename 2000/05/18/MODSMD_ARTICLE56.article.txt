Noah . . I mean, w ho is Noah? I le was
brought onto the show a couple ol seasons
ago and got involved with 1 )onna: ollicial
l\ one ol the most boring relationships
cvei. I hc\ linalh broke up — early in this
veai's season, I think —because he drank
too 11111< 11 01 something, lie's still 011 the
show, and the sioi\ involving him is that
he met ibis also boring — ( hit k named
Helen I lien ai an Akoholies \nonymous
meeting and be( ame her sponsor — and
vei'\ recently, bet hnvli'iend. ()l course he
bonded with hei little daughlci kaitlin,
and last night, when I.lien I lelen asked

him to make a commitment to her and
her daughter, Noah said yes.
()n to the Kelly/Dylan saga. So Dylan
was brought hat k onto the show last year
as a "special guest star." lie's still hot as
evei — holler, actually, because his hair
isn't gelled up "> inches above his fore
head. lie's still "mysterious," "hard to
read, and "constantly needs to cleai his
throat." And since he came back, lie's
pretty iniii h been following Kelly around,
proclaiming his love in every way other
than just coming out and saying it. Kelly,
meanwhile, lias been engaged to Matt, a
promising, young, IK)'I lawyer, who has
about as much personality as cardboard.
I'heii relationship was honestly the most
uninteresting thing ever, and the whole
Matt-being- jealc mis-01-I )\ la n-and-Dylan -
i rying-to-steal-Kelly-away-and-Kelly-hav
ing-to-clloose plot got very old, very last.
()l ( out se, last night Kelly broke oil her
engagement to Matt, finally acknowledg
ing her feelings for Dylan. In the process
ol breaking his heart, Kelly lound out that
he'd cheated on her, but since that's the
onl) remotely interesting thing Mali's
evei clone, it was hard to feel bad lor
Kelly. Malt moved to New York to be a
lather to his dead brother's unborn
daughter who is actually Malt's biological
daughter because he donated his sperm
to his inlertiel brother and his wile. I
swear, that's true.
Dylan and Kelly were best man and
maid ol honor — respectively — at the
Donna-David wedding, and as they each
read .1 poem dining the ceremony, they

undressed each oilier with tlieir eyes.
I lie wedding was great, enhanced
slightly by the reap|)earances ol the newly
hlonde Valerie and the still-awkward
Andrea, lirandon made a pseudo reap
pearance in die form of a video tape lie
sent In the bride and groom, wishing
them the best and apologizing lor not
making it to the wedding. ()li — and Mrs.
Teasley tame back lor Donna's
bHchloreiie partv as well as the wedding.
Nat walked Donna down the aisle, lilting

in for her father, who recently (lied of a
heart attack <>i something, lias Nat ever
not been a "father figure?" Anyway, it was
cute. Donna's dress, however, was not.
But the final episode ever of 9-0 cer
tainly was. While there's no question that
the first few seasons of the show were the
best, the remaining cast did a good job
with their final performances. I, for one,
w ill miss them ;ill.
