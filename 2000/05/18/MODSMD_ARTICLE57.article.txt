# O, Brenda Brenda wherefore art thou?
## 
### ALICE BROWN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Let's be honest: when Brenda
left, the show took a severe turn for
the worse. Yeah, they brought on
characters like (Hare and Valerie to
try and till the "bad-girl" void, but
Brenda was so much more than a
"bad-girl" that her departure left a
big hole in the show.
Brenda Walsh has never
returned to the show. She's never
mentioned, never talked about.
Donna didn't even invite her to the
wedding.
Yeah, so maybe Shannon
Doherty was a bitch. Maybe she
was "hard to work with." Maybe
she "antagonized the entire cast
and they hated her and she was
thrown off the show." So what?
Brenda Walsh was the best charac
ter the show has ever had. No
character has ever been so juicy or
entertaining, no plot as interesting
as the ones in which she starred.
She could deliver the line "win
don't you just shut up" so well that
it's a wonder she didn't win
awards.
In her four seasons on 90210,
Brenda threw countless temper
tantrums, lost her virginity to
Dylan, thought she was pregnant,
thought she had breast cancer, was
best friends with Kelly, called Kelly
a bitch and gave her the silent
treatment, obsessed over Dylan,
dumped Dylan, got back together
with Dylan, ran away from home,
left California to go to school at the
University of Minnesota, left Min

nesota to return to "CU," got
engaged, almost eloped, and final
ly went lo London to be an actress.
She was a busy, bitchy, absolutely
terrific character.
She was vastly more interesting
than her brother Brandon, tin
more spirited than her parents Jim
and Cindy, smarter than her
friends Kelly and Donna and had
43 times the personality of Iter
boyfriend Dylan.
Brenda gave us the classic
break-up scene in Dylan's car, on
the beach, listening to "Losing My
Religion," when she tearfully told
him, "it's all moving too last." And

what about the episode in which
she disobeys her parents and goes
to Mexico for the weekend with
Dylan, only to get stopped at the
border on the way home? And
rememl)er the episode where she
appears on the sleazy I V show
"Back Story" and makes all her
friends hate her?
Hut most memorably, Hrenda
gave her viewers the gilt of the
most classic conversation in
"90210" history. Hrenda is back
from Paris, having cheated on
Dylan with Kick — or "Reek," as
she called him in her lake French
accent. Dylan had kept himself
busy by hooking up with Kelly.
Hrenda and Dylan break up,
agreeing to see other people. The
next night, Hrenda takes kick —
who has transferred to UCLA —
out to dinner. Of course they run
into Kelly and Dylan. A catfight
breaks out, culminating in the fol
lowing unforgetable lines:
Kelly: Are you calling me a slut?
Brenda: Well 1 was always
taught if it looks like a duck, and
walks like a duck . ..
Kelly: Go to hell.
Wherever you are, Brenda, hell
or otherwise, we miss you.
