### ROXY SASS 
"Love is not the dying moan of a dis
tant violin. It's the triumphant twang of
a bedspring."
■S.J. Perelman
Miss Sass's most recent date brought
her hack to his room, but he seemed
uncertain about the next step — he'd
never bedded such a sassy lady before.
His buddy and another girl stopped
by, brought some beers, and wanted
to play a game of poker. Miss Sass
rolled her eyes and pointed her high
heels toward the door — until she
heard mention of "strip" poker. Cer
tainly the idea of gambling with
clothes instead of money would spice
up the action?
Miss Sass, an expert in the ways of
clubs and hearts, marched herself
back into the game with glinting eyes.
She led the boys on with a few losing
hands and a glimpse of a lacy bra
(honey, certainly the strip tease is the
most important part of the game?) But
once the boys got a bit cocky, swelled
with pride, and distrac ted by thoughts
more spicy than spade-y, Miss Sass
took control <>l the game. She soon
collected her winnings and left, leav
ing some shocked and blushing boys
with only the opportunity to retrieve
their clothes in person — for a reason
able trade, of course.

Sex games like strip poker have a lot ol erotic potential,
and they can introduce an element of chance into your sex
play. It's liberating to agree to play by someone else's rules,
and being told what to do oilers a welcome change lot those
whose sexual experiences lack all imagination.
■ Strip Poker
No one seems to know the official rules lor this standard
game, but Miss Sass recommends a take-oil on live card
draw. Ihe losers take oil One article of clothing, and the win
ner collects all of them. Of course, this method might leave
someone nearly naked after only lour rounds ol play. (Then
again, the purpose is to gel naked, right?)
If you want to draw the game out, Miss Sass suggests you
assign monetary values to articles of c lothing, so shoes might
be worth $1 but a bra $10. You take oil the clothes, take
your money and play with it. When you need more money
and want to keep playing, you know what happens.
Ladies, what better reason to accessorize? Finally, garter
belts have a purpose! And gents, hope you're not wearing
your purple Barney briefs — she might not approve.

Miss Sass recommends playing with people with good taste
in clothing — and don't be alarmed by the orgy which is
bound to happen once enough skin gets exposed.
■ Orgasm Races
Lie back on the bed — get your right hand ready — start
thinking dirty thoughts — (io!
The go.tl of this masturbation game should be obvious.
Whoever orgasms first wins an agreed upon prize.
It actually works out pretty well. If the girl orgasms first,
she's probably ready for sex, and his still-erect penis will nat
urally be happy to oblige. 11 lie wins, 1 emember he'll have a
refractory period before his penis can harden again, so his
prize may need to have a time-delay attached to it.
Miss Sass recommends this for guvs who want to go strong
all night long. Foreplay will likely be enhanced, ladies,
because what else has he got to do while he's waiting to get
hard again?
I his game does involve some complications: Obviously, i!
the guy is so distracted by the sight of her masturbating, lie's
likely to lose. Then again, he's more likely to be excited b\
the sight than she is, which inav help him to orgasm faster.

■ Sexopoly
This game takes some time and cre
ativity to put together, but it's well
worth it. You need to make your own
"Monopoly" hoard, five squares by five
squares. Clothing is the currency of the
game, hut removing one article of
clothing or doing whatever sexual
favor your partner requests for one
minute are interchangeable activities.
Also, you can get out of any activity by
removing one article of clothing.
You'll need a regular pair of dice so
you can move around the board, as
well as a pair of Dirty Dice, which can
be bought at your local sex shop. One
Dirty Die has suggestive verbs on it,
like "suck," "lick," and "fondle." The
other die has body parts oil it. When
you roll the dice, you have to do what
they say to your partner — you get the
idea.
You'll also need to make some cards
for the middle of the board, just like in
regular "Monopoly." You should make
them together. Miss Sass suggests that
most of your cards contain explicit sex
ual suggestions, such as "Suck your
partner's nipples hard," "Go read an
erotic story online with your partner,"
"Spread whipped cream over your nip
ples and make your partner lick it off,"
"Talk dirty to your partner," or " Trace
a line of butterfly kisses all over your

partner's inner thighs."
In Miss Sass's opinion, the "how" of an action is just as
important as the action itself. Perhaps this game could help
von to change your methodsmayhe you always suck her nip
ples hard, but after heat ing her moans on the "Nuzzle her
nipples gently" card, you'll oiler her more variety. Each
action should be done for one minute.
You should also include some standard cards like "Get out
of jail free," "Go to such-and-such a space, etc."
Your game hoard should include properties, which can be
bought with varying amounts of clothing. Rent on the prop
erty is, again, paid with one article of clothing or a minute of
sexual favor. You'll want a jail (Miss Sass likes playing with
handcuffs — use your imagination), a Go To Jail space,
spaces that make you draw a card, and spaces that make you
roll the Dirty Dice. When you pass Go, you get to collect one
article of clothing.
II you're feeling particularly adventurous, you could try
playing this with a group, but try not to break the furniture.
Miss Sass realizes tli.it a game like this can never really end.
You'll know it's over when you're both (or all) in a sweaty
heap on the floor.
