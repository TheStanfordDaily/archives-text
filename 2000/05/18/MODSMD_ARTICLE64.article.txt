# Find your sports fix online

I here's something special «il>out spring —
the fact that there are live major sports play
ing games as we speak. Whether you like to
watch Barr> Bonds, splash down blasts,
Sha<|uille O'Neal's thunderous dunks or
I igei Woods's roc keting drives, you can he
cjiiic kl\ appeased this time of the year.
I lie thing is, though, we all have < lasses.
We .ill have ( rap to do. I he natural rcme
d\ loi the situation is ol course, going
online. I lie Internet, though mostly used

loi day trading, porn finding, and online auction
ing, is a bountiful source for sports highlights for
those without cable television or hours of lime
on their hands.

I hose that watch sports on television
know that ESPN's SportsCcntcr and Fox
Sports' News are the benchmarks lor
sports information. FSPN is king,
though. What athlete sings the Fox
Sports News theme, what ball player
wants to make the (INNS I highlight of the
week? From IVtci (.amnions to Dan
Patrick, Sportsdcnter lias proven itself to
be the supreme provider of sports analysis
and wit.

I .1111 biased, I w ill admit, www.espn.com is my welcome mat
to the Internet, my home page. But. much like Sports Ce
nter, the site is easily navigated, the highlights and scores are
readily found, and the analysis is well thought-out. Articles
come <it least weekly from the likes of Gammons, David
Aldridge, and Jonathan Stark. Links to most different pro
fessional sports' own sites are generously included, and fan
tas\ games are always being offered. The only weakness may
be FSPN.coin's Insider program, which saves interesting
articles for those that pay the site five dollars a month. But if
vou're willing to pay, the progfam quickly becomes a bonus.
www.foxsports.coin is just not as good. It's flashy looking,
but tlu- scores are hard to find, and the analysis is second
rate. Pardon me, all you Jim Rome fans, but not only is the
guv annoying, he is often wrong. Keith Olberman is tolera
ble, but Rome's flash is the more common Fox approach to
giving the news.
\mong the second string of sports news sites,
sports.excite.com was the best of the worst. The site was easy
to use and c lean looking, but the analysis is not plentiful.
Check out Fxcite's team pages for the template FSPN.com
must have used to recently revamp their own team pages,
w ww.c nnsi.com is a poor site. I'm not incredibly aestheti
calh oriented, but I just don't like ugly sites, and CNNSI's
site is butt ugly. I just didn't want to surf around it all. even
there were hidden nuggets of sports wisdom in among the

boxy graphics and big fonts. And no search function? That
just ain't professional.
If college sports are more your thing, try
w ww.fiinsonlv.com. Fansonly is completely focused on the
college scene, down to having a "Recruiting Central" section.
In this section, you could search for different athlete's verbal
commitments to colleges — it you were insane about your
sports knowledge, that is.
www.sports.coin is the international approach to the sports
thing. I he first sport listed on the menu bar is "Rally," and
I'm not quite sure what that even is. You can even switch
languages to get your soccer highlights and analysis.
Of the major American sports' official pages, www.nba.com
is the best. The NBAs site is stacked with awesome high
lights, and if you wade through the cheesy sections aimed
towards the younger crowd, you can find the most detailed
information on the playoffs.
www.mlb.com has the best during-game coverage: the site
allows you to get a play by play while looking at all of the rel
evant averages and statistics.
For the sports fan, this is a good time. For the sports fan,
the Internet is a valuable resource. You can see Ken Griffey,
Jr hit a walk-ofl homer almost ten minutes after the Reds
head to the showers in Cincinnati, or even Martin Brodeur's
spectacular saves as he speaks to the television cameras in
Philadelphia. So sports fans, turn off that television and log
on.
