Archbishop under fire
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Catholic Archbishop
William Levada is under fire from San Francisco's gay
community for widely disseminated remarks about the
city's Cay Pride Parade, comments he says were distort
ed.
Levada was quoted May 11 in the Rome newspaper II
Messaggero and his alleged remarks were spread via the
Internet.
Levada said he was speaking at a dinner where a re
porter was present but did not take notes. His comments
came during a discussion of World Pride Roma 2000,
planned for July 1 to 9. The gay pride event coincides
with the Catholic Church's millennial Jubilee celebra
tion.
The Vatican is particularly irritated at a gay march
July 8 through central Rome; it's the most visible event
during a week of political and cultural events planned
since 1996.
"I can't believe it. It's not possible for this to happen
during the Jubilee. I'm amazed that the government
would permit it," Levada is quoted as saying. "Obviously
the Italian authorities have no idea what might happen.
I his kind of demonstration is not controllable."
SF votes on campaign finance
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — On the heels of their most
expensive election ever, San Franciscans will vote on par
tial taxpayer financing of local campaigns, and may also
consider curbs on the independent committees that
boosted spending to new heights last year.
Despite opposition from Mayor Willie Brown and city
supervisors, the city's independent Ethics Commission
lias placed a public-financing measure on the November
ballot.
Like measures in effect in Los Angeles, New York and
several other c ities, it would offer matching funds from
the city treasury to candidates for the 1 1 supervisors'dis
tricts who raise minimum amounts from local residents
and agree to limit their spending.
Candidates receiving at least $7,500 in donations of
$100 or less would be eligible for an immediate $5,000
and 112 urther matches of up to $43,750 if they stay below
the existing spending limit of $75,000. The limits would
be lifted if a candidate's opponent spends more than
$75,000.

Christian group rebounds
after anti-gay bias charges
I lifts University has decided to welcome back a Chris
tian organization that had been stripped of its campus fi
nancial support after a student charged that it discrimi
nates against homosexuals. But that decision could
c hange next fall, when the issue will once again come be
fore a student judiciary panel.
month, the student judiciary panel stripped the
Christian fellowship of its status as a university-recog
nized organization, deciding that the group had violated
the campus nondiscrimination policy by refusing toallow
a gay student to run for a leadership position. The fel
lowship's leaders maintained that they had rejected the
student not because she is gay, but because she does
not believe homosexuality is a sin.
On Monday, the Committee on Student Life, a panel
of students and faculty members, ruled that the student
panel had failed to follow its own procedures in the case,
because it met without theknowledge of the fellowship's
leaders and suspended the fellowship's privileges before
it had a chance to appeal.
