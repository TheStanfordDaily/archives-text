THIS STORY WON'T GO AWAY
www shareintl.org
AWAKE!
In 1929 J. D. Bernal expanded on
the idea of space colonies If only
the world's R&D "experts" had
comprehended the potential
magnitude of the idea By now
we'd have colonies throughout
the solar system & on their way to
all stars within ~ 50 light years
With our foot dragging lack of
enthusiasm we have shown
humans to be no different than
ants or termites on our little
colony Earth Let's give up
following the bunglers & finally
get started in the right direction.
That is implementation on the
Gerard K O'Neill Model with a
new grass roots type
organization As Ray Bradbury
phrased it in his 1977
introductory paragraph for
Heppenheimer's "Colonies In
Space" Let's move, Let's go there,
Let's do the job. Mr
Heppenheimer offers
you citizenship in the Universe.
