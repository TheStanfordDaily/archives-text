1942
Stanford's engineering students have tra
ditionally been labeled as the most harried,
the most stressed, the most busy ... but
imagine being an engineering student at the
Farm during World War 11.
"Engineering students who will be in the
Lower Division in Summer Quarter prereg
ister on May 25 and 26. Since the courses to
be given depend on the two registration
programs, it is important that everyone
planning to attend Summer Quarter should
preregister.
"Engineering students should remember
that they are usually deterred from the draft
if they have a well-planned program and
reasonable grades," Dean Morris reminded
them.
The Bottom Line: Who knew a study list could be
so important?
