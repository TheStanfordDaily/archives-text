with the While House over the future of
U.S. ground troops in Kosovo, removing
language from a bill that would have set a
date for withdrawal.
I he Senate voted 53-47 to take out a
provision in a military construction spend
ing bill that would have terminated U.S.
military participation in Kosovo on July 1
next year unless the president requested
and Congress approved an extension.
Vice President Al Gore, who hopes to
be president next year, made a rare
appearance in his capacity as president of
the Senate to c ast a tie-breaking vote if nec

presidential rival. Republican George W.
Bush, asked Congress to back away from
the deadline.
