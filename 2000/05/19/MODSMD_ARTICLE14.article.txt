Otherwise, the embargo will last for
12 months and the council will then
decide whether it should be extended.
In the Eritrean capital yeseterday,
Asmara, a presidential spokesman,
called the embargo unfair because the
sanctions do not differentiate between
the victim and aggressor.
"It is not just," said another

"Ethiopia is the aggressor. This has
never been a border war. Ethiopia has
used the border issue as a pretext to
invade Eritrea."
Ethiopia also criticized the U.N.
decision. Haile-Kiros said that the
Security Council's action was "wrong
and meaningless."
