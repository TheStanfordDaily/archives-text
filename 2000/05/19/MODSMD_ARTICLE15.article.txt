# Greenspan endorses China trade bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — With just a
week to go, both sides ol the China trade
debate ratcheted up their lobbying cam
paigns yesterday, with supporters drawing
within striking distance of a win in the
I louse.
()pponents posed outside the (lapitol with
a 200-foot metal chain to dramatize the
plight of China's political prisoners. In a
competing event, President Clinton gave
Chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan
Greenspan a Rose Garden podium to pitch
the landmark legislation.
I he vote "will have profound implications
for the free world's trading system and the
long-term growth potential of the American
economy," Greenspan said.
Clinton also planned a live-minute Oval
OHice speech to the nation Sunday evening.
I he bill would extend permanent normal
trade relations to (Ihina and ease the way for
its entry into the 135-nation World Trade
Organization. It would end two decades of
annual congressional votes on China's trade
status.
Supporters remained publicly cautious,
saving they still lack the 218 allirmative votes
needed for House passage.
"We are not where we need to be. We
have more votes to get," said White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart.
But, privately, other administration offi
cials and their congressional allies were far
more optimistic.
I he House takes up the legislation next
week, with a final vote expected Wednesday
or I hursday.
Although widely supported in the Senate,
most I louse Democ rats remain opposed, clue
in large part to a fierce lobbying campaign b\
organized labor. Business groups have ral
lied in support of the measure.

rallies and news coulcrcnces ycsterda\ to vie
