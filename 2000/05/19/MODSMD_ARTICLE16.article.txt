SANTA IT, N.M. (AP) — Hie
National Park Service officials
who started (lie devastating Los
Manios bla/c did not follow prop
er procedures and did not have
enough lire crews on hand to
keep it undei control. Interior
Secretan Bruce Babbitt said yes
terday.
Babbitt released the results of a
preliininar\ investigation into the
bla/e, which w.is set Mav I to clear
brush at the nearby Bandelier
National Monument but was driv
en out ol control by wind that
gusied to mote than .">() tnph.
I he blaze forced 25,000 peo
ple to flee, m ore bed 17,000 ac res,
left 10") families homeless and
damaged the storied Los Alamos
uuc leai weapons laboratory. I he
two-week-old lire was still onlv 00
percent contained In vesterdav.
"It's clear there were large mis
takes ol agencv oversight," Bab
bitt said.
" I be c ausal c hain of this fire is
<|iiite complex. I would liken it to
w hat happens on a mountainside
w hen a roc k is dislodged," he said.
I hat one rock can create a "cas
cading series ol events."
I he repc >i I found a "number
ol (i itic a I deviations from both the
preset ibed lire plan and standard
lire practices" — including not
putting firefighters on standby
belore stai ting the lite.
I lie- i epot I said Bandelier
cinplcnee Mike Powell, whodircct
l\ oversaw the- prescribed burn,
notified lirclighting dispatchers in
Santa l e the morning of May 1
that the bm n was to take place that
evening. A dispatcher expressed

concern because the Forest Service
had suspended prescribed burns
because of high wind and dry
weather, the report said.
I he investigation found that
the plan was not "substantively
reviewed" before it was approved
In Bandelier Superintendent Roy
Weaver, who has taken responsi
bilitv for the bla/e and has been
placed on leave.
" I here's a tendency to rubber
stamp dec isions made In people at
the field level." Babbitt said. "That
is an unacceptable paradigm."
There was no answer yesterday
at Weaver's home. There was no
listing lor Powell in northern New
Mexico.
Shortlv alter the fire swept out
ol control, the National Weather
Service said that on May 4 it had
sent Bandelier oHicials a special
forecast indicating there was maxi
mum potential for fire growth,
with increasing wind and tempera
tures and higher-than-usual night
time humidity.
The investigators made no
mention of the Weather Service
report spec iliciallv but questioned
the value of a measurement it
quoted — the Haines Index,
which describes the potential for
fire growth. The Weather Service
report on May 4 said the Haines
Index was at 0, its highest rating.
"Los Alamos has been hit In an
I <S-w heeler, and the government
was clri\ ing that IN-w heeler," Clov.
Ciary Johnson said at Babbitt's
news conference. He also asked
the people of New Mexico to "give
the govei nment a c hance to make
good on this."
