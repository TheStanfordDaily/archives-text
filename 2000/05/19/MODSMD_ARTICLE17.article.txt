## The
						Stanford Daily Are double majors symptoms of weakness or strength? 
### 
Published Since JB9l

IT IS NOT uncommon for Stanford stu
dents, known to be an ambitious group,
to complete two majors. Such an endeav
or is usually respected. At a recent Facul
ty Senate meeting, however, Kconomics Pro
lessor John Shoven argued that the prevalence
ol double-majoring students was a "weakness,
not a strength." He remarked that "either
these students are incredibly studious or the
majors are so easy that you can do two ol
them." I lis implication is that the latter is the
case, and he seems to be suggesting that indi
vidual departments add requirements in
order to limit the number ol double majors.
Shoven does raise a good question about the
reason for this phenomenon. I lowever, having
a large population of students who double
major is not necessarily a sign ol weakness.

Moreover, the practice should be seen as an
opportunity lor departments and indeed the
University as a whole to better address stu
dents' needs.
Ultimately one has to answer the question:
why do students take on a second major, espe
cially given the large number of other aca
demic and extra-curricular options at this
University? Double majoring certainly limits
the c hoic es of students in some respects, but it
also increases possibilities in others. For exam
ple, a second major may make studying
abroad or spending ;i quarter in Washington,
!).(!. unfeasible, but it might also allow stu
dents to explore ;i particular academic field in
more depth and engage in more direct
research. Perhaps — even at Stanford — dou
ble majors are more interested in academics

than anything else.
More likely, however, students decide to
double major with an eye to jobs and graduate
schools. Oftentimes, students feel that their
chances of being hired or admitted will
improve with a heavy or well-rounded aca
demic record on their resume. Double major
ing also gives students the opportunity to com
bine a "practical major" with a major that is
less directly applicable in the work force.
(lonsequently, increasing major require
ments would have little apparent benefit.
W'onld the courseload be increased simply for
the sake of it or because students currently
graduate with an inadequate understanding
of their major? And why exactly is the pres
ence of double majors a sign ol weakness, and
not strength, for the University? These are

questions that need specific answers.
Furthermore, increasing academic require
ments lor the sake of it needlessly hampers
students from pursuing additional academic
interests and from — whether justified or not
— strengthening their academic credentials. It
will slow them clown and do little to address
the actual reasoning behind the practice of
double majoring.
In the final analysis, additional require
ments 011 top of an already rigorous workload
would only limit the range of choices for all
students both inside and outside the class
room. If double majoring is an evil that must
be prevented — a contentious idea indeed —
then the University should do something to
address the underlying causes of the problem
rather than punishing students.
