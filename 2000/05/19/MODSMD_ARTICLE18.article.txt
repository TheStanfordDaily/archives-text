Change is an everyday thing. But lor
some reason, it is something I will never

the other night. It was
1 I :!i() p.m. My room
mate and I decided to

and go to Denny's.

well-balaiK ed meal juxtaposed them
selves into a llui r\ of emotion and moti
valion that found us iu inv roommate's
cherr\ red Cratid Cherokee, chugging
our wa\ down I I (laniino.
I was getting cm ited. I hadn't been In
Denny's since ... well ... Winter
Quarter. But th.it didn't matter. I could
almost t.iste the eggs and hash browns
coating in\ stomach with ( heap grease.
I could sense the familiar frustration of
ti \ ing to studs and resist the distnu tion
ol the incredibly amusing characters
who spend the better part of every
evening playing the silly "drop a claw
and pull up a stuffed animal'' game that
is tigged so no one can win. I could feel
Denny's, a home, a foundation, a rock
that I would always look back to as a
stalwart symbol of constancy and
strength in my ever-changing Stanford
expei ience.
And then it happened. We arrived
.uid Denny's had changed. Denny's was
purple! Denny's had a completely new
color scheme! Denny's was now called
the Denny's Diner. Denny's looked
more like the lVacli Pit than it did
Denny's. For crying out loud, they even
had a working jukebox.
My world was turned upside down.
Change is 0.K., but this was insanity. 1
freaked (like I have in so many of my
other columns). What would happen to
all my memories iu the wrong color
scheme? I stopped breathing. I tried to
leave, and then remembered that a
Lyon's liamhurget was now a $20 meal.

Frantically, I turned back to the counter
searching lor something to bring me

one and rip its head out when 1 remem
bered that it was impossible lo ever win
that game. I was losing it. I needed a
sign, something to bold on to, a spatula
with which lo llip my world right-side
up.
And then she emerged. She was
wearing the new Denny's colors, but the
colors hadn't taken away who she really
was. She was as liery as ever and she still
bad that . . . you know . . . attitude. It
was Monika, that crazy Swedish waitress
thai we all know and love. (We have
never ac tually identified whether she is
Swedish 01 some othei ethniticity. Dan

been tossed around as possibilities. I lie

She wears that sash around her head,

who looks even remotely like me). I

take iiiv order. It was a big change from
the frightened lowering with which I
used to order. It was a change.

going to change in three weeks. I can
guarantee you they are all looking for
their own "Monika," their own string
that will keep the world straight. We all
have to lind our own "Monika." With
out "Monika," things might just change
a little too fast for us. With "Monika,"
we know that no matter what changes

little attitude with our Buffalo Chicken
