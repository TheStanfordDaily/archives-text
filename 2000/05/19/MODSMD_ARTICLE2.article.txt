# Stanford ready for incoming freshmen
## 
### UDARA FERNANDO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Now that Dean of Admission
Robert Kinally has finished woo
ing next year's freshmen class,
student volunteers will begin to
do their part to ensure a smooth
transition for the Class of 2004
into lile at Stanford.
A guaranteed highlight for in
coming freshmen will be the ori
entation, organized entirely by
current undergraduates working
with the Dean of Students' ()ffice.
This year, orientation will take
place from Sept. 22 to 26.
"As most Stanford students
would agree, new student orien
tation is a fantastic way to begin a
freshman's life at Stanford," said
sophomore Lindsay Arnold, an
orientation coordinator. "The en
thusiasm of the incoming class is
contagious...they are excited
about coming to Stanford and
eager to contribute to the com
munity."
Angela Castillo, senior and
head orientation coordinator, de

scribed the role of orientation vol
unteers as being one of organiz
ing rather than executing.
"There are some programs
that we come up with and we im
plement, but mostly we organize
all the programs from depart
ments that want to be part of the
orientation program," she said.
Castillo said that since the Uni
versity usually tries to give the stu
dents the same basic information
each year, this year's program is
going to be very similar to last
year's. Traditional favorites like
Faces of the Community, a pre
sentation on diversity at Stanford;
the A Cappella Fest and Real
World, an introduction to peer
pressure issues, are expected to
dazzle the incoming class.
In past years, orientation orga
nizers have had to struggle devis
ing an events schedule that did
not conflict with Jewish holidays
and the first football game of the
year, which freshmen can usually
attend at a discounted price.
