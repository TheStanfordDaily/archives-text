# Stanford ready for incoming freshmen
## 
### UDARA FERNANDO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Now that Dean of Admission
Robert Kinally has finished woo
ing next year's freshmen class,
student volunteers will begin to
do their part to ensure a smooth
transition for the Class of 2004
into lile at Stanford.
A guaranteed highlight for in
coming freshmen will be the ori
entation, organized entirely by
current undergraduates working
with the Dean of Students' ()ffice.
This year, orientation will take
place from Sept. 22 to 26.
"As most Stanford students
would agree, new student orien
tation is a fantastic way to begin a
freshman's life at Stanford," said
sophomore Lindsay Arnold, an
orientation coordinator. "The en
thusiasm of the incoming class is
contagious...they are excited
about coming to Stanford and
eager to contribute to the com
munity."
Angela Castillo, senior and
head orientation coordinator, de

scribed the role of orientation vol
unteers as being one of organiz
ing rather than executing.
"There are some programs
that we come up with and we im
plement, but mostly we organize
all the programs from depart
ments that want to be part of the
orientation program," she said.
Castillo said that since the Uni
versity usually tries to give the stu
dents the same basic information
each year, this year's program is
going to be very similar to last
year's. Traditional favorites like
Faces of the Community, a pre
sentation on diversity at Stanford;
the A Cappella Fest and Real
World, an introduction to peer
pressure issues, are expected to
dazzle the incoming class.
In past years, orientation orga
nizers have had to struggle devis
ing an events schedule that did
not conflict with Jewish holidays
and the first football game of the
year, which freshmen can usually
attend at a discounted price.
"These events usually leave
spaces of time where we can't pro
gram anything," Castillo said,
"But this year we're fortunate be
cause there are no conflicts."
The official calendar for orien
tation has yet to be released.
"I got involved in this organiza
tion because I really enjoyed NSC)
and 1 thought it would be interest
ing to see what goes on when
you're planning such a huge
event," Castillo said.
She also lauded the volunteers
who applied for the program, say
ing that they are key part of its suc
cess.
Current undergraduates
working for the New Undergrad
uate Student Information Project
assist tlu- orientation volunteers
by taking care of the nuts and
bolts of the freshmen's transition
to university life. The project acts
as the primary collector and
clearinghouse of information

about incoming freshmen, dis
tributing forms returned by stu
dents to the appropriate depart
ments.
The project is also in charge of
making housing and roommate
assignments. A computer pro
gram processes students' hous
ing applications and then ran
domly assigns freshmen to a dor
mitory. After this process, Joe
Narens, senior project coordina
tor, and Nikki Sickles, junior pro
ject coordinator, sift through the
roommate preference forms and
select roommates.
Project staffers also work with
the Area One and the Writing
and Critical Thinking programs
to assign IHUM and freshmen
English classes for incoming
frosh.
"I've been involved in a lot of
different things on campus," Sic k
lessaid. "And NUSlPseemed like
an office that works with pretty
much everyone on campus."
Narens said he became in
volved with the project because
he wanted to give back to the
Stanford community.

"1 had a really good freshman
experience, and I wanted to en
sure that other freshmen have
that same experience," he said.
Narens said that the project's
procedures are roughly the same
as last year.
During the summer, the I 11-
dergraduate Advising Centei
uses students' profiles to match
incoming freshmen with volun
teer advisors.
"Over the summer we have a
group ol students who woi k with
us," said Handle DeSandies, an
associate director ai the center.
"We get together and loi in a<l\ is
ing groups based on primal ) aca
demic interest."
DeSandies said the center's
mission is to provide freshmen
with an introduction to the advis
ing process.
Once students arrive on cam
pus, the center is instrumental in
providing freshmen with the
basic information they need to
choose their c lasses.
"We want the freshmen to get
the most of their education at
Stanford," DeSandies said.
