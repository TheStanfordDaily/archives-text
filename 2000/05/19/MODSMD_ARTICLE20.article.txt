Praise for "Powwow Stories"
Bravo! Congratulations on your won
derful, powerful insert on the Stanford
Powwow.
After volunteering fin a brief time on
Friday morning readying the site, I was
unable to attend the program this week
end. Your essays are a tribute lo the spir
it ol this tremendous tradition and your
photos are documented proof of the fact
that the canopies were successfully con
structed (which is particularly amazing
given we are novice tent builders who no
doubt slowed down the process)! I feel
like 1 was there.
I hanks also to Winona, Dcnni and
Creg of the American Indian, Alaska
Native and Native Hawaiian Program
Office and the dozens of student mem
ber.s of SAK) and community volunteers
who made the program possible.

Daily photo mismatch more than harm
less mistake
I am writing to alert you to a discrep
ancy in one of your news illustrations ol
which I would prefer to think you were
unaware.

Hit- discrepancy occurs in the May 17
World & Nation report entitled "Israelis
watch the Lebanese retreat," and is
between the report and its "accompany
ing" photograph. 1 he AP report discuss
es the logistics and tensions surrounding
the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the
northern Israel/south Lebanon buller
/one.
I lie photograph, however, is of some
thing quite different: it depicts two blast
helmeted Israeli soldiers, automatic rifles
cocked and ready, and a visibly alarmed
boy apparently trying to put as much dis
tance between them and himself as possi
ble. The caption reads, "A screaming
Palestinian boy runs past Israeli body
guards aiming at Palestinians during
c lashes in the West Bank town of Hebron
yesterday."
The contextual inferences of this
description aside, what has the photo
graph got to do with the report? I could
understand if the editors simply had no
available image to illustrate the story, but
the choice of an illustration from an adja
cent yet completely incommensurable
story (the ongoing Israeli / Palestinian
conflict over the Occupied Territories) is
careless, misleading and journalistically
irresponsible.
I lie effect of the juxtaposition is far
more than non-sequitor, of course: a pho

tograph of occupation and purported
oppression does not "illustrate" a story
about the alleviation of such occupation
elsewhere, it ironizes it almost to the point
of editorial subversion.
Whether the result of negligence or
intention, such decisions represent an
unacceptable lapse in journalistic credibil
ity. As an instructor in Stanford's Writing
& (Critical Thinking program, I am disap
pointed at the example you set.
