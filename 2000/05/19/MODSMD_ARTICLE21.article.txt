## Softball suffers NCAA setback 
### EMILY DRESSEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At the end of a long Softball career,
whether il be high school, college, or
even after, every player has rooted in her
memory those games that she can't help
but look back on, time and time again -
sore spots where scars were never
healed.
It's those games that make her wince
while replaying what went wrong, frame
by frame in her head—cringing at the
rehearsal of the crowd in uproar, the
taste of clay on her lips, and the blood
running down her knee brae e where she
slid into second.
Yesterday, at the NCAA Regional
Softball tournament in Ann Arbor,
Mich., the Stanford softball team (45-17,
9-12 Pacific 10 Conference) had one ol
those games.
I he overcast, hazy weather seemed
an appropriate backdrop to the Cardi
nal's thirteen inning loss ('J-1) to I he No.
(i seed in the Michigan regional, (lentral
Michigan University (31-1 I).
"We made three errors to their
none," said head coach John Rittman.
"Those cost us. At this level, you just can't
make errors and expect to be pitched out
of them every time. Both their runs
scored on our mistakes."
The game was a long and torturous
marathon extending almost 3.5 hours,

with both pitchers going the distance, se
nior 1 ina Kinney (23-6) for the Chippe
wasand freshman Dana Sorensen (22-9)
for the Cardinal.
After escaping scot-free from a first
inning defensive jam where Central
Michigan loaded up the bases with only
one out, Stanford sophomore center
fielder Jessica Mendoza, offensive stand
out and Pat -10 Player of the Year, ex
ploded in the bottom half of the inning
with her twelfth home-run of the season.
Kinney quickly learned why you
don't throw the high fast-ball to Men
doza and managed to somehow rein in
the offensive superstar for the duration
of game, to some extent.
Alter a 45 minute rain delay halfway
through the second inning, the under
dog Chippewas stormed the field anx
ious to retaliate with a run of their own.
After its leadoff hitter reached first on
an error. Central Michigan hunted her
around the horn and eventually pulled
off a run in the third.
I he scoreboard remained deadlocked
at one apiece until the bottom of the sev
enth, when the meat of Stanford's line-up
was up and eager to rattle up the score.
Mendoza led off with an infield single,
then stole second off the Chippewa
pitcher to eliminate the force out and
put herself in scoring position.
Senior c atc her Kellie Wiginton nearly
clinched the game for the Cardinal when

she slashed a double out to center, but
the center fielder came up with a spec
tacular bulls-eye relay and managed to
throw Mendoza out in a colliding play at
the plate.
I'he next six innings were bursting
with nail-biting near-misses and diving
defensive stops. One minute it looked to
be Stanford's game, and the next, Cen
tral Michigan seemed to have the upper
hand.
Yet somebody had to win. And in the
top of the thirteenth inning, the ('hippe
was were the first to put it all together.
Lite lead-ofl hitter reached first on an
infield single and then advanced to third
on a deep right field pop-up that was
fumbled by Stanford. With runners in
scoring position, Kinney grounded one
between third and short to score the win
ning run.
Stanford seemed to deflate after that,
having been so close to taking the game
and now faced with the distinct prospect
of falling to the No. (i seed. Ultimately,
the Cardinal's No. 1 regional ranking
did not in any way protect them from los
ing and leaving the field looking down,
exhausted, and glassy-eyed.
In spite of Stanford's disheartening
loss, one player in particular showed
tremendous character yesterday—the
freshman from San Diego who has taken

elimination game today at 10 a.m. EST.
