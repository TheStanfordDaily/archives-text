Cetting a bid to the NCAA
Regionals is nice.
Hosting one on your home
field is even better.
Adding in the fact that your
team has just topped the 40-
win mark for the sixth straight
season, it'd be hard to find
much fault with a season that
finds that team with a shiny No.
2 ranking and the respect of
the entire college baseball es
tablishment.
"Regardless of what hap
pens this weekend, to be 40-12
with our schedule...it's been a
great season. It's tough to win
40 games," said Stanford's
coach Mark Marquess.
Somehow, though, you

consecutive title and to give
Stanford a sweep of the I'ac

Awaiting the Cardinal this
weekend is a three-game series
with the first-place UCLA Bru
ins, who are aching to win their
first Pac-10 title since 1986.

UCLA lingered behind Stan

of the season, but claimed the
top spot alter a convincing
sweep of Arizona last weekend.
I he scenario is this: UCLA
(!i4-22, 16-5 Pac-10) currently
leads the Pac-10 by a single
game over both Stanford (15-0
Pac-10) and Arizona State (40-
12, 15-6), with otdy three
games remaining for each
team.
While UCLA and Stanford
battle in Palo Alio, ASU travels
to arch-rival Arizona to finish
out the regular season. 1 laving
