# Baseball goes for 4th consecutive title
## 
### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Cetting a bid to the NCAA
Regionals is nice.
Hosting one on your home
field is even better.
Adding in the fact that your
team has just topped the 40-
win mark for the sixth straight
season, it'd be hard to find
much fault with a season that
finds that team with a shiny No.
2 ranking and the respect of
the entire college baseball es
tablishment.
"Regardless of what hap
pens this weekend, to be 40-12
with our schedule...it's been a
great season. It's tough to win
40 games," said Stanford's
coach Mark Marquess.
Somehow, though, you
don't quite believe him. The
Pacific 10 Conference title sits
out there, wailing for someone
to claim it. And despite what
Marquess says, you know he
wants his team to win its fourth
consecutive title and to give
Stanford a sweep of the I'ac

l()'s three major sports for the
academic year—football, bas
ketball, and baseball.
Awaiting the Cardinal this
weekend is a three-game series
with the first-place UCLA Bru
ins, who are aching to win their
first Pac-10 title since 1986.
Due to the various bye week
ends included in the schedule,
UCLA lingered behind Stan
lord and Arizona State for most
of the season, but claimed the
top spot alter a convincing
sweep of Arizona last weekend.
I he scenario is this: UCLA
(!i4-22, 16-5 Pac-10) currently
leads the Pac-10 by a single
game over both Stanford (15-0
Pac-10) and Arizona State (40-
12, 15-6), with otdy three
games remaining for each
team.
While UCLA and Stanford
battle in Palo Alio, ASU travels
to arch-rival Arizona to finish
out the regular season. 1 laving
defeated both the Bruins and
the Cardinal in series play, the


JESSICA YU/The Stanford Daily
Sun Devils hold the tie breaker
over both teams in the event of a
deadlock at the top.
So, for Stanford to bring home
ihe title, they must win at least
two of three against the Bruins
and hope Arizona can topple
ASU at least twice over the week
end.
"There's not much we can do
about Arizona State," Marquess
said. "We're not going to be look
ing [at the scoreboard] too much,
because we'll have our hands full
with UCIvV"
F lands full, indeed.
" They're a veteran team, they
have a good pitching staff, and
they're a great offensive team —
they hit a lot of homeruns," Mar
quess said. "They don't run a lot,
but they don't have to because
they have tremendous power up
and down the lineup."
The coach is certainly correct
about that. UCLA's lineup has
four players who have topped the
15-homer mark, and leads the
conference with a total of 104
blasts on the year.
On the pitching side, sopho
more righthander Josh Karp,
who will start Friday night, has
won his last seven decisions and
has held opposing hitters to .203
average, good for third among
Pac-10 starters.
Saturday's starter, junior lefty-
Rob Henkel, has been named Na
tional Player of the Week three

times this season and held Ari
zona to one hit in seven innings
during his last outing.
Throw in recently named ju
nior All-America left fielder Bill
Scott, tops in the conference with
a .435 average and second in
homers with 21, and winning two
out of three against the Bruins
becomes a daunting task.
Not a team to be cowered eas
ily, Stanford will combat UCLA's
pitching studs with some serious
horses of its own. Junior righty
Jason Young gets the ball Friday
night, bringing his own impres
sive 7-0 mark and 3.42 earned
run average to the hill against
Karp.
Junior Justin Wayne, recently
named an Ail-American by Base
ball Weekly, heads to the mound
Saturday with his 11-3 record
and 3.10 ERA in tow to take on
Henkel. Sunday's starter has yet
to be named, but Marquess said it
will most likely be either sopho
more Brian Sager or freshman
Tim Cunningham, both of whom
have tremendous stuff.
And, of course, Stanford's
lineup is nothing to sneeze at ei
ther. Senior center fielder Ed
mund Muth has smoking the
ball of late (16 HR, 61 RBI on
the season), and junior right
fielder Joe Borchard (14 11R, 56
RBI) has regained his form of a
year ago after beginning the sea
son mired in a slump.
First pitch Friday night is at (>
p.m., with fireworks following
after the game. Saturday and
Sunday's games get underway at
one.
