capture its fifth title in the past
six years when the tournament
continues from May 20-23 at the
University of Georgia in Athens.
Although the Cardinal, the
top seed in the tournament, is
one of the favorites to win the
national championship, the road
to the title will be difficult.
First up, Stanford will com
pete against No. If) seed Min
nesota (24-6) in the round of Hi

go clown to Alliens and play."
