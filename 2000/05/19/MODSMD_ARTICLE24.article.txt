# A
						budding basketball rivalry bites the dust
## 
### 
It was supposed to be a great rivalry, four
years of two of the best men's hoopsters
in the country going head to head, twice
a year, with conference crowns on the
line.
Leave it to the UCLA guy to screw it up.
Following the 1999-2000 season, which
saw them share Pacific 10 Conference Fresh
men of the Year honors, the Bruins' Jason
Kapono and Stanford's Casey Jacobsen fig
ured to dazzle West Coast basketball fans lor
years to come.
(acobsen and Kapono dueled their way
through the teams' two meetings this year,
matching up at the shooting guard/small for
ward position and taking turns lighting the
scoreboard.
In the two games combined, Jacobsen
scored 36 points. Kapono tallied !W.

I lien on Saturday,
kapono killed the rivalry,
taking his signature while
headband out <>l Westwood
and into the ridiculously
large pool of underqualified
underclassmen declaring
for the NBA Draft.
Most analysis agree
Kapono isn't helping him-

self by leaving UCLA after just a year. He's
tall, quick and a good shooter. But he's not
ready for Showtime.
Look for Kapono to slide to the second
round, where the contracts aren't guaran
teed and the playing time is limited. A good
15-20 early exiting players should go be
fore Kapono in the draft, including two
other UCLA forwards, Jerome Moiso and

Jaßon Rush.
1 know what you Stanford hoops fans are
thinking: who tares? let Moiso and Rush and
Kapono and any other Bruin who wants to
file the papers and get the hell out of the I'ae
-10. Karl Watson. Matt Barnes, Ra\ Young —
go!
Let I ( LA drop below Washington Slate in
the standings. Let Steve I avin cr\ nightly in
his hair gel. Let Stanford take a broom eat h
year to Southern ( '.alifornia as a matter ol lor
niality.
I hearvou. I 111 glad to see Moiso and Rush,
a pair of (lardinal killers, oil to seek their pro
fessional fortunes. But I wish, for entertain
ment's sake if nothing else, that Kapono had
staved.
