### JESSICA TUCKER-MOHL EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford researchers completed a "landmark"
study on the effectiveness of combinations of depres
sion treatment, published yesterday in the presti
gious New England Journal of Medicine.
The study found that the antidepressant drug
Serzone, when combined with appropriate psy
chotherapy, offers the best treatment for sufferers of
long-term depression.
" This is the first study that's been large enough to
adequately test whether combination treatment is
truly superior to medication or psychotherapy
alone," said Assoc. Medical Psychiatry Prof. Bruce
Arnold, the study's co-author, in a press release.
The study is also unique in that it focuses on the
treatment of chronic depression, rather than short
term depression.
"1 think c linicians will start to reconsider what is
the best, most optimal strategy of treatment for
chronically depressed patients ... [they] will more
commonly look to combining psychotherapy with
particular types of medication," said Kenneth T.

Norris Junior Prof. Alan Schatzberg, chair of the de
partments of psychiatry and behavioral science at the
medical center.
The type of therapy used makes a difference, ac
cording to Schatzberg.
"[M]odern therapies try to be focused on chang
ing cognitive processes, in terms of the way the indi
vidual patient approaches the problem. Others may
approach it by trying to tackle problem-solving ap
proaches the patient utilizes."
He cautioned that the results may not apply to less
structured forms of therapy. "This study was done
with manualized, well-designed types of psycho ther
apy"
Schatzberg also spoke about awareness in treat
ment of depression. "1 think [depression patients] are
frequently not well-diagnosed and frequently not
well-treated. Many of them don't receive adequate
drug treatment â€” half fare] not-treated and half of
the treated are not adequately treated," he said.
The "enormous" trial involved 600 patients, ac
cording to Schatzberg.
The study was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co., makers of the depression drug Serzone.
