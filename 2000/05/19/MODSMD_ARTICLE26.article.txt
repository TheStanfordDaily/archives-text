# Men's track races for another title
## 
### BEN ALLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
1 layward Field in Eugene, Ore.
- as track and field's mecca over the
last few decades, the Pacific 10
Conference couldn't have picked
a better venue for its champi
onships meet.
But it could have picked a bet
ter time.
Not that the choice was really
up in the air, but in an Olympic
year that will see a large number of
Pac-10 athletes competing in
Sacramento's Olympic Trials July
14-23, nobody should expect to
see the usual all-out fight for team
domination between USC, UCLA
and Stanford.
This weekend may turn out to
be more of a tune-up than any
thing else. But if trends from re
cent years hold, No. 2 Stanford
should not be overly concerned
with the weekend's outcome.
Stanford has finished seventh and
third in the Conference the past
two years, respectively, and those
performances were followed up
by second-place showings at
NCAA's, both years behind cur
rent No. 1 Arkansas.
That's not to say outstanding
performances won't abound for
Stanford. And if the Cardinal is to
make a charge at the champi
onship, distances will lead the
way. Stanford owns the top five
times in the conference in the
10,000-meter run, the top four in
the 1,500 and four of the top five
marks in the 5,000.
More quick races in the distances
are likely. With Stanford closer than
ever to a national championship
this year, the Cardinal could rack
up a few bonus NCAA qualifiers in
the distances in Eugene.

Senior Jason Balkinan, who has
already qualified for the Olympic
Trials and NO\As automatically
in the 10,000, has yet to do either
in the 5,000 meters. Likewise, red
shirt sophomore Gabe Jennings,
who is capable of doubling suc
cessfully in the 1,500 and 800-
meter runs at both the NCAAsand
Trials, has yet to pick up a qualifi
er for either in the 800. Pac-lOs
will be the final opportunity for all
athletes to snag NCAA qualifying
marks.
Stanford had only two confer
ence champions last year - senior
Nathan Nutter in the 10,000 and
freshman Michael Ponikvar-and
neither will be back for the Car
dinal.
While Nutter has graduated,
Canadian Ponikvar has returned
home in order to train fora possi
ble appearance with Canada's
Olympic team.
Stanford still has a shot at a
number of individual titles this
weekend. Senior Toby Stevenson
has cleared 18 feet, 2 1/2 inches in
the pole vault this year and is cur
rently ranked second in the con
ference. Jennings and redshirt ju
nior Michael Stember will both
contend for titles in the 800 and
1,500 meters. They are currently
ranked 1-2 in the nation for the
1,500 with times of 3 minutes,
37.33 seconds and 3:40.54, re
spectively.
Senior Brad Hauser is current
ly tops in the conference and sec
ond in the nation in the 5,000 at
13:29.71, and brother Brent, also
a senior, is No. 1 in the nation in
the 10,000 at 28:23.37. Other con
tenders include junior Chad
Wassink in the javelin, junior
Todd Beyerlein in the high jump
and redshirt sophomore

Jonathan Riley in whatever he
chooses to run.
Stanford enters the meet at a
slight disadvantage, as several
teams gained points towards the
team til It- at last weekend's I'ac

10 Decathlon Championships.
()regon leads with 18 points, and
Clal has a 15-point head start.
Competition starts today at I

at <S p.m.
