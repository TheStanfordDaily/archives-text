# Women head to Oregon for Pac-10s

### BECKY BLANCHARD EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford women's track
and field team will arrive in Eu
gene, Ore., with an early lead in
the title race.
But the Cardinal will have to
go the distance to maintain it.
Before competition has even
begun at this weekend's Pacific 10
conference track and field cham
pionships, the Stanford women
have jumped ahead of the pack,
thanks to points carried over
from last weekend's Pac-1() Hep
tathlon Championships.
A second-place finish from
redshirt junior Joy GofT and a
fifth-place performance from
redshirt senior Julie 'Pinker in
heptathlon gave the Cardinal 12
early points, good for first place
going into the conference meet.
Stanford is the heavy favorite
in this weekend's distance events
and will rely on solid perfor
mances from the distance and
middle-distance crews to main
tain momentum from last week
end's success. With the loss of
Tracye Lawyer to graduation,
Stanford must look elsewhere for
much-needed points in the
sprints and field events if the Car
dinal hopes to better last year's
fourth-place team finish.
Stanford will be tough to top in
the distance department. While
other Pac-10 schools boast one or
two star harriers, the Cardinal's
depth typically puts plenty of per
formers on the podium in the
longer races.
In the 1500 meters, junior
Sally Glynn, freshman Lauren
Fleshman, sophomore Colleen
Flaherty and freshman Lindsey
Hyatt will step to the line in the
preliminary heats seeded 4-5-8-9,
respectively. The Cardinal is 3-4-
5 in the 3000 meters, with Flesh

man, sophomore Erin Sullivan
and Glynn leading a crew of eight
Stanford runners, including Fla
herty, who finished third last sea
son.
Perhaps the strongest race for
the Cardinal will be the 5,000 me
ters, where Stanford is currently
running 1-3-5-7-8.
Fleshman again leads the
pack, followed by Glynn, Sulli
van and sophomores Elena Vil
larreal and Caroline Annis.
Annis, along with senior Mary
Huang, will also compete in the
10,000 meters, where she holds
the fourth-fastest time going into
the competition.
In the sprints, Southern Cali
fornia and Arizona both boast
tough squads loaded with big
stars. Stanford senior Wilsa
Charles and redshirt junior Jayna
Smith will carry the torch against
the Trojans and Wildcats for the
Cardinal.
Smith, the school record-hold
er in the 400 meters, is coming off
a fifth-place performance at last
year's conference meet and a
solid outdoor season.
Charles finished sixth in both
the 100- and 200-ineter races last
year. Hyatt will likely contend for
the 800-meter title, currently
holding the second-best time in
the conference at 2 minutes, 5.64
seconds.
Stanford's chances in field
events look to be up for grabs, as
a number of Cardinal athletes
carry top-ten marks into the
meet. Senior Summer Pierson is
seeded second in the discus and
returns as a top-three finisher last
season.
Freshman Kathleen Don
aghue and junior Melissa Fein
stein will compete in pole vault
and freshmen Cheryl Burdick
and Kim Stone may bring points
in high jump.
