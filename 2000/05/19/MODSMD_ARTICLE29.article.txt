# Women's rugby finishes fourth in Tampa
## 
### KATRINA LOGAN 
After fighting through Regionals and the
Sweet 16 tournament, the Stanford women's
rugby team (13-2-1, 6-1 Pacific Coast League)
finally made it back to the 112 inal Four in Tampa
Bay, Fla. on May 6th and 7th only to realize that
they would have to defend their national cham
pionship with clipped wings. I lie team ulti
mately lost 25-5 to eventual champion Penn
State and 17-10 to Illinois in the consolation
game, finishing fourth overall.
The Cardinal made it to the Final Four in
spite of injuries that felled three of its starters.
Brittney Blunt, Lisa Brooks, and Felicia Gilbert
all were hampered by injuries going into
Tampa Bay.
Blunt, a former All-American fullback, suf
fered a concussion in the sweet sixteen game
against University of Virginia and couldn't even
do school work, let alone play rugby.
Then there's Brooks, a starting flanker, who
was missing an ACL. Although she started in
the first game of the Final Four, she only played
about five minutes before she tweaked her knee
and had to leave the field.
And Gilbert, one of the six freshman rookie
starters, suffered a strained MCL in the sweet

sixteen, and was slowed in both games in the
Final Four by a bulky knee brace.
()n Saturday, May 6, the Cardinal struggled
to get their offense going throughout the entire
game while Penn State pounded their way
down the field with their Ail-American for
wards. I he intense heat and humidity in
I ampa Bay also hampered Stanford even fur
ther because Palo Alto has not seen such ex
treme weather this year.
Farlier in the season Stanford actually beat
Penn State, but that time the Nittany Lions were
without some of their All-American forwards
and backs in addition to their head coach, who
was away coaching the national under-23 team.
I he next day the team played the University
of Illinois for third place in the consolation
game. The Cardinal lost in overtime 17-10 in a
long, grueling match to University of Illinois,
with the Illini scoring a controversial try in the
final half of overtime to get the win.
When a player scores a try, the player must
touch the ball down in the in-goal (end-zone) in
control. 'I'lie try, which is similar to a touchdown
stored in football, was ruled fair by the referee
even though the player for Illinois clearly did
not have the ball under control as required in
the official rules of the game. Also, earlier in the

game, the referee also took away one of Stan
ford's trys because Chelsea Swett, who appar
ently scored it, did not have the ball under her
control—an obvious inconsistency by the refer
ee considering the call made later.
Although the team was clearly disappointed
after their losses, some members of the team
were nevertheless positive about the trip to
Tampa Bay.
"The most valuable thing 1 believe we've seen
is that our team can really come together despite
the injuries and graduating fourteen seniors last
year, and play incredible rugby throughout this
season," said junior Molly Sullivan.
Next year, the women's rugby team antici
pates another competitive season. With only
three seniors graduating this year — Anne-Car
oline Carnier, Jaimey Glass, and Brooks—the
majority of the team will return with a tough ex
perience in the Final Four behind them.
"This team will only improve next year —
they have amazing potential," senior co-captain
Brooks said.
Although the team may have lost this year,
with added determination, teamwork, and ex
perience that was absent this year, the Stanford
Women's Rugby team can look forward to an
other trip to the Final Four in its future.
