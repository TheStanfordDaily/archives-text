The Constitutional Council jumped the
last hurdle to finalizing the results of the
ASSU spring elections, issuing final rulings
on the four remaining cases Tuesday
evening.
The Council determined that the elections
were not "substantially affected" by the pres

in dorms, campaign spending caps, a prohi

An additional part of that charge, relating
to an interview with I hc Stanford Daily, was
dropped.
Although changes in the rules governing
runoff elections were made last year by the
Undergraduate Senate, they were not incor

because there was no constitutional basis for

sioner Jason Rang, a coterminal student in
economics.
The final charge under consideration,
stating that three editors and a reporter for
The Daily had violated the confidentiality of
those testifying before the-1 learings (commis
