# It's over: Constitutional Council rules on charges
## 
### JESSICA TUCKER-MOHL EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Constitutional Council jumped the
last hurdle to finalizing the results of the
ASSU spring elections, issuing final rulings
on the four remaining cases Tuesday
evening.
The Council determined that the elections
were not "substantially affected" by the pres
ence of several campaign restrictions found
to be unconstitutional. Those restrictions in
cluded limits on the numbers of flyers posted
in dorms, campaign spending caps, a prohi
bition on campaigning the week before elec -
tion day, and several regulations of candidate
Web sites — limiting the number of sites per
candidate to one, requiring registration of
that site and prohibiting links from that site to
electronic polling sites.
The decision to validate the election was
not unanimous, but a majority vote would
have been required fora new set of elections.
The Council also ruled on a charge against
ASSU Hearings Officer Katie Young, a ju
nior, regarding informing candidates about
investigations for campaign violations. The
Council found that in three areas — notifying
the candidates of their constitutional "Rights
of the Accused," informing candidates of the
charges against them and the actions on
which those charges were based, and giving

the candidates sufficient time to prepare a de
fense — Young's actions were unconstitu
tional.
" The charges have no merit," Young said
in response. "At no time did I violate any
rights of the accused."
In a unanimous vote, the Council found
that the presidential election did not consti
tute an "act stemming" from the unconstitu
tional acts.
An additional part of that charge, relating
to an interview with I hc Stanford Daily, was
dropped.
Although changes in the rules governing
runoff elections were made last year by the
Undergraduate Senate, they were not incor
porated into the constitution.
The Council dropped the c harge ques
tioning the legitimacy of (he runoff election,
because there was no constitutional basis for
(he changes, according to Flections (lonunis
sioner Jason Rang, a coterminal student in
economics.
The final charge under consideration,
stating that three editors and a reporter for
The Daily had violated the confidentiality of
those testifying before the-1 learings (commis
sion, was also dropped. The Counc il found
that an April 24 commission meeting, held to
discuss investigation of the violations, was

open and thus the individuals had
not violated the confidentiality of
the witnesses or the accused.
Although the official proceed
ings of the Council have conclud
ed, several ASSU officials continue
to protest the Council's methods
and the judicial nature of the hear
ings.
Elections Commission mem
bers pointed out that the Constitu
tional Council's rules state that the
charges must be ruled on within
one week and the council took
much longer than that.

Young refused to attend the
hearings, saying that the council
did not acknowledge the ASSU's
formal Rights of the Accused, and
that she believed she could not get
a fair hearing from Council Chair
Harris Shapiro, a physics doctoral
student.
"Although the Council claims to
merely rule on acts and not peo
ple, the fact remains that there is
always an actor associated with an
act," Rang said, arguing that the
Rights of the Accused should apply
to respondents in Council cases.
I'he Rights of the Accused require
strict confidentiality for those
under investigation of ASSU viola
tions.

lii a written statement, the
Council responded that the Rights
of the Accused do not apply be
cause "the Constitutional Council
is expressly (brbidden the powers
of indictment and thus punish
ment of any individual members of
the Association. I lie Council only
considers whether actions taken
are constitutional or not. We tan
not and do not mete out punish
ments for any such actions."
The charges were originally
brought by live members of the-
Graduate Student Council on
April 26. ASSU President Mike
Levin joined on two of the i liarges,
but subsequently withdrew his
name from them.
