# Far IM fields don't deter teams
## 
### ZACH DILLON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite being moved to playing fields near the
medical center, intramural sports are still luring
students away from their work for yet another
quarter.
This year, teams must now make the trek out to the
new IM fields, which are on Welch Road.
"It's less convenient coming from this side of cam
pus," said junior Cary Colvin, a Computer Systems
engineering major who lives in Wilbur 1 lall. "But I've
never had anyone say that they won't make the trip.
1 he players are committed...sometimes they bike
over when they can't find a ride."
Soccer Commissioner Brendan Stuhan, a junior
majoring in history, said that the number of people
participating in intramural sports has not dwindled
since the games have moved to the new fields.
"It's pretty similar," Stuhan said. "The old fields
were on one far side of campus, and the new ones are
on the other far side."
Stuhan feels that the move is a change for the bet
ter. Previously, the IM teams shared tlie intramural
fields with the rugby teams, who used them for prac
tices.
"It's nice to have our own fields now," Stuhan said.
"It's a lot easier to schedule games."
Stanford students can take part in three spring IM
sports: soccer, volleyball and softball in three divi
sions: Co-ed, Division I, and Division 11.
While Division I usually indicates the highest level
of competition in varsity collegiate sports, this is not
necessarily the case with IM sports.
"DII (Division 11) can actually be more competitive
than DI." said junior Sin 1 aur Fang who is majoring
in Mathematics. "In soccer freshman year all the good

teams wanted to win, so they all played 1)11."
Although basketball is the most popular intramur
al sport overall, the spring favorite is sorter, with 42
Division 11 teams, IS Division I teams, and 24 Co-ed
teams. Softball and volleyball also have a substantial
number of devoted participants.
Colvin, who lias been the intramural coordinator
for Trancos I louse for the past two years, tell short of
his goal of winning a softball championship last year.
He hopes to realize his dream this spring. I lis softball
teams have already made the playoffs.
"Fall quarter, 1 guaranteed Francos a champi
onship at house meeting," Colvin said. "It's kind ol
been my life's mission ever since freshman year."
To help reach this goal, Colvin began holding soli
ball practices (lut ing lall quarter, taking Wilbur field
as often as three times per week when the weather al
lowed it. Colvin also fielded three separate teams:
" Francos" and "Cowboys from Hell" in Division 11,
and "War Nerve" in Division I.
"My intent was to win 1)11 all along," Colvin said,
"but I want to take a shot at winning them both. I'll be
very disappointed if we don't."
Colvin was not quite as intense about volleyball.
"We had two 1)11 teams this spring," he said. "Both
went 0-5. We lost in straight games ten straight times
this quarter. I guess [junior Eric] 'No (lame' I larp de
cided that we needed two volleyball teams so we could
be doubly embarrassed."
1 lowever, the point of intramural sports is to allow
people who desire to play competitive sports at any
skill level to do so, and to have fun with their friends
at the same time.
"IMs are good because they include people at ;ill
levels of play," Stuhan said. "There are lots of players
at near-varsity level, and there are lots out there who
may be playing soccer for the first time."
