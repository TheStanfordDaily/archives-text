The Alfred IV Sloan Founda
tion recently announced that Stan
lord professors Gigliola Staffilani,
lialaji I'labh.ikar, and Thomas |.
Wandlass were chosen out of 104
scientists and economists to each
receive a research fellowship
worth $40,000.
I'lie Sloan Research fellow
ships were ( reatecl in 1955 to give
voting, newly appointed scientists
support and recognition.
"Its purpose is to stimulate fun
damental research In young schol
ars of outstanding promise," states
the fellowship's brochure.
Recipients of the fellowship say
that its recognition of their work
motivated tliein to continue their
studies with renewed enthusiasm.
"I was ver\ sin prised to receive
the award," said StaMilani, a matli
ematic s professoi.
I he department told me
about the nomination at the last
minute," Stafliliani said. "I didn't
really think people had taken
enough notice ol my work lor me
to get theaward. Ii isa real boost to
the ego to be recognized by your
peel s with such an award."
I lie award's financial support
allows professors to take more
time off, giving them a chance to
focus more on their own studies.
Staffilani said (lie fellowship
would give him more free time

away 112 rom teaching to continue his
studies of differential equations.
"It is an honor and I'm delight
ed to receive this fellowship. The
monetary part of the fellowship
will help fund research in comput
er and wireless networks, my main
area of interest," said Prabhakar,
an assistant electrical engineering
and computer science professor.
I le was awarded the fellowship for
pioneering research in the field of
computer science.
I he Sloan Foundation added
the field of computer science to its
fellowship program in 1993.
Prabhakar said he hopes to fix
many problems apparent in net
working during his fellowship.
"I plan to use ideas from other
disciplines to understand and
solve problems in networking,"
Prabhakar said. "For example. I 'd
like to learn how ideas from game
theory and economics can be used
to motivate users to share network
resources in a distributed fashion.
"I'm keen to continue working
on the algorithmic aspects of de
signing wireline and wireless net
works," Prabhakaradded.
I lie fellowship's brochure
states the research fellowships are
designed "to identify those who
show the most outstanding
promise of making fundamental
contributions to new knowledge."
