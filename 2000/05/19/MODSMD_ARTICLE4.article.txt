ister Louis l-'arrakhan, the minister at the
National Headquarters of the Nation of
Islam, and the son of the late I lonorable
Klijah Muhammad. Elijah Muhammad

ulate the pain of Black people like no
other leader," he continued.

tude," he said.
"If you don't connect with God,
you will leave Stanford bewil
dered. perplexed and without use
ful tools for solving the human
condition."
Amid intermittent applause
and shouts of approval, Minister
Muhammad continued, "You
should know by now that Klijah
Muhammad had nothing to do
with the murder of Malcolm X.
What would the teacher gain by
killing the student?
"As Malcolm said, 'You already
been had, took, hoodwinked, led

astray and run amuck.' When you
invite a Muslim leader, you're ab
solutely guaranteed to hear the
truth because 1 can back it up.
"Malcolm X was a brilliant
man...l don't know who pulled the
trigger. We don't know, but the
government refuses to open up
the files."
A question and answer session
followed the speech. The first
question, posed by an audience
member was, "What are your
thoughts on the assumption that
Malcolm X left the Nation of Islam
because of the affairs of Elijah
Muhammad?"
Minister Muhammad respond
ed, "It is a misunderstanding that
Malcolm X left The Nation or
began to have problems with his
teacher because of Elijah Muham
mad's domestic life. Malcolm was

able to defend Klijah Muhammad
from the perspective of the di
vine...! know win he had to have
children. I believe it wasn't out <>l
lust."
Other events during the week
included a video presentation at
Flicks last Sundav; a panel discus
sion of the social, political and per
sonal life of Malcolm X on Mon
day, and a talk and hot >k signing by
History Professor Claybourne
Carson who addressed the rela
tionship between Martin Luther
King, Jr. and Malcolm X on Tues
day. Last Wednesday, religious
leaders of different faiths from the
surrounding comnuinitv engaged
in a discussion regarding the role
of religion in black social move
ments.
In an interview before 11 is ad
dress, Minister Muhammad re

marked, "[Malcolm X's| death and
assassination has been the subject
of controversv for many years
now. It's been .'ir> years since his
tragic death in 19('). r ). We are still
questioning why after 35 years the
killers have not come forward even
after one of the men sent to prison
has submitted 4 or 5 names as sus
pects.
"We believe tli.it this subject,
this question 'Who killed Mal
colm?', 'What role did the govern
ment play in his assassination?' is
something that the black commu
nity is very interested in knowing,
especially since it has been put at
the door of the Nation of Islam...
even though Louis I'arrakhan's
name was never mentioned as a
suspect, we have to ask whv 35
years later they at tempting to con
nect him to the killing of Malcolm

X."
I le also added, "I would hope
with ilit' help of Allah, God, to dis
pel some of the myths that sur
round the life and death of Mal
colm, my father, the Honorable
Klijah Muhammad, The Nation,
and the Honorable Louis Far
rakhan. I hope that I can encour
age the students to locus on the
condition of our community and
that they will take what Stanford
has to offer and bring it back to the
development of our destroyed
communities.
lle continued, "[I hope! that we
would focus on the crisis of the
black family and for us to see that
we are under siege and under at
tack. We have to come in here to
these institutions to gain, to get
that which we need, but always
with our people in mind."

some of the life of Malcolm X, he also
spoke at length about the tenets of the Na
tion of Islam, the life of the I lonorable Eli
jah Muhammad, and the relationships be
tween those beliefs and the responsibility
of college students.
"Gratitude is the prerequisite to all real
success...you've been fortunate to make it

yourself. Whatever accomplishments you

are blessed with, show no ingrati
tude," he said.
"If you don't connect with God,
you will leave Stanford bewil
dered. perplexed and without use
ful tools for solving the human
condition."
Amid intermittent applause
and shouts of approval, Minister
Muhammad continued, "You
should know by now that Klijah
Muhammad had nothing to do
with the murder of Malcolm X.
What would the teacher gain by
killing the student?
"As Malcolm said, 'You already
been had, took, hoodwinked, led

astray and run amuck.' When you
invite a Muslim leader, you're ab
solutely guaranteed to hear the
truth because 1 can back it up.
"Malcolm X was a brilliant
man...l don't know who pulled the
trigger. We don't know, but the
government refuses to open up
the files."
A question and answer session
followed the speech. The first
question, posed by an audience
member was, "What are your
thoughts on the assumption that
Malcolm X left the Nation of Islam
because of the affairs of Elijah
Muhammad?"
Minister Muhammad respond
ed, "It is a misunderstanding that
Malcolm X left The Nation or
began to have problems with his
teacher because of Elijah Muham
mad's domestic life. Malcolm was

able to defend Klijah Muhammad
from the perspective of the di
vine...! know win he had to have
children. I believe it wasn't out <>l
lust."
Other events during the week
included a video presentation at
Flicks last Sundav; a panel discus
sion of the social, political and per
sonal life of Malcolm X on Mon
day, and a talk and hot >k signing by
History Professor Claybourne
Carson who addressed the rela
tionship between Martin Luther
King, Jr. and Malcolm X on Tues
day. Last Wednesday, religious
leaders of different faiths from the
surrounding comnuinitv engaged
in a discussion regarding the role
of religion in black social move
ments.
In an interview before 11 is ad
dress, Minister Muhammad re

marked, "[Malcolm X's| death and
assassination has been the subject
of controversv for many years
now. It's been .'ir> years since his
tragic death in 19('). r ). We are still
questioning why after 35 years the
killers have not come forward even
after one of the men sent to prison
has submitted 4 or 5 names as sus
pects.
"We believe tli.it this subject,
this question 'Who killed Mal
colm?', 'What role did the govern
ment play in his assassination?' is
something that the black commu
nity is very interested in knowing,
especially since it has been put at
the door of the Nation of Islam...
even though Louis I'arrakhan's
name was never mentioned as a
suspect, we have to ask whv 35
years later they at tempting to con
nect him to the killing of Malcolm

X."
I le also added, "I would hope
with ilit' help of Allah, God, to dis
pel some of the myths that sur
round the life and death of Mal
colm, my father, the Honorable
Klijah Muhammad, The Nation,
and the Honorable Louis Far
rakhan. I hope that I can encour
age the students to locus on the
condition of our community and
that they will take what Stanford
has to offer and bring it back to the
development of our destroyed
communities.
lle continued, "[I hope! that we
would focus on the crisis of the
black family and for us to see that
we are under siege and under at
tack. We have to come in here to
these institutions to gain, to get
that which we need, but always
with our people in mind."
