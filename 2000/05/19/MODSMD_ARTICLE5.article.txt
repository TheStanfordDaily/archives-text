### SCOTT DORFMAN STAFF WRITER 
Willi the end <>l the year approaching, sin
dents would be well advised to keep a lew
extra dollars on hand, as the Student 1 lousing
Services stall will soon be making the rounds
of dormitories to assess lines lor room d;mi
ages.
The end ol the year inspections have been
the subject ol some controversy on campus,
with many students feeling that the charges
imposed by the housing stall are too high for

the amount of damage actually done to a
room. Officials claim that lines are assessed
lairlv and only (over the fixed costs ol replace
ment.
" If damage has occurred in a student room,
the Facilities Supervisor will refer to the room
condition form that was turned in by the resi
dent upon taking occupancy of the room,
said Rodger Whitney, director of Student
I lousing Services.
" If the damage is shown on I he form as pre
existing, then there is no charge to the stu
dent. II the resident did not turn in the form

or otherwise report the damage, then the
charge is issued. Charges come from the ac tu
al costs to repair 01 replace the item that lias
been damaged. I his includes t lie cost ol mate
rials and labor."
However, some students who have been
subject to lines strongly disagree with Whit
ney's assertion that lines only cover "the cost of
materials and labor."

Hansen said. "I know that 1 could
have peeled two stars off my wall
fora whole lot less than $48."
"1 was fined for having a small
pile of clothes and two pairs of
shoes outside of my room in the
hallway," said sophomore Sudha
Sathiaseelan, a resident of Naran
ja last year. "I don't think it is fair
that I was fined for leaving shoes
and clothes outside my room
when 1 was forced to live with an
other person in what was de
signed to be a one-person room."
Whitney insisted that no extra
costs, besides labor and materials,
are factored into the determina
tion of fines, except under very
special circumstances, such as
damaged fire equipment, where
students are subject to "substan
tial fines, University disciplinary
action and possible criminal
penalties."
While students are fined fora
variety of infractions, Whitney
said the most common infraction
is students not "delofting" a bed.
"It is expected that students
return their beds to the configu
ration they were issued the bed,
the lowest setting," Whittle) said.
"Some students do not do this
and are then charged the labor
charge for having the bed re
assembled to the appropriate set
ting. Since fwe] have been con
cerned that c|iiite a few stude nts
receive (his charge at the end of
the year, fwe] offer a free sei \ ice
through May 26, not alter,
where, upon request, we will
send staff 'members to reassemble
the beds to the correct setting."
Whitney would not disclose
how much money is received
from end of the year damage
lines, saving only that the nione\
is used for existing repaii s.
"The money that we receive
Irom damage charges goes cli
rectly into tlie operation budgets
for both graduate and under
graduate housing to pa\ repair
or replacement charges, ' W hit
ney said. "[We] believe it is im
portant that the individuals who
cause damages should be the
ones to pay for them—it is unfair
for those individuals to expect
others, either within their resi
dence or in the student housing
system as a whole, to pa\ lor
their c arelessness or desti uctive
