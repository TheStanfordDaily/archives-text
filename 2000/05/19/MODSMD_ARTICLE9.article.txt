ACLU sues state over schools
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AF) The means for improv
ing California's public schools are there: a $12.3 billion
state budget surplus. Now there's a powerful incentive: a
civil rights lawsuit alleging "appalling conditions" at
schools attended by poor and minority students.
The American Civil Liberties Union sued the state
Wednesday in San Francisco Superior Court on behalf of
students from nine urban districts.
The lawsuit outlines a two-class system in which poor
and nonwhite students go to schools with "terrible slum
conditions," unqualified teachers and few up-to-date
textbooks, while white, middle- and upper-class children
have quality learning tools and good conditions.
Hie lawsuit asks the court to rectify the situation by or
dering the state to provide textbooks, qualified teachers,
well-maintained schools and "equal educational oppor
tunity" for all students.

Wisconsin ends referenda
The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that
the University of Wisconsin did not trample anyone's
First Amendment rights by letting its student leaders give
mandatory-fee revenues to campus groups that hold
views that some students oppose. At the same time, how
ever, the court was troubled by a university policy allow
ing the student government to hold referenda on the fi
nancing of certain big-ticket organizations, such as the
Wisconsin Public Interest Research Croup.
'Fhe justices said they had approved the fee system as
suming that student leaders allocated money to campus
groups in <1 viewpoint-neutral manner. But the use of ref
erenda to make financing decisions may introduce a non
neutral element — majority rule — into the process, the
court warned.
I'he justices asked a lower court to decide whether the*
campus referenda should end. But ii looks as though the
university system's president, Katharine C. Lyall, is not
taking chances by waiting for that decision.
This month, in a letter to the c hancellors of the sys
tem's campuses, she warned that it appears that the ref
erenda iu question "do not satisfy the viewpoint neutrali
ty standard established by the Court." She directed the
chancellors to alter campus policies accordingly.

Presidential search must
begin again at U. Florida
Fhe search fora new president of the University of
Florida collapsed this month, when (lie remaining two fi
nalists for the job withdrew.
After William V. Muse, president of Auburn Universi
ty, dropped out, the state university system's chancellor,
Adam W. Herbert, recommended that a Board of Re
gents committee indefinitely suspend the hunt fora new
chief. Fhe panel agreed lo do so. Fhe last candidate, An
thony J. Catanese, president of Florida Atlantic Universi
ty, then tin ned down a request by Mr. I lerbert to remain
a finalist when a new search begins.
Fhe regents' search committee, which had selected
five finalists by this spring, now must start the process
anew. The prospect of quickly finding new candidates
and setting a new deadline for the search could pose chal
lenges, according to thechancellor and the director of the
search firm employed by the board, Korn/Ferry Interna
tional.
Part of the* reason stems from uncertainty over
whether state lawmakers will abolish the Board of Re
gents, the chancellor said. Charles F. Young, a former
chancellor of the University of California at I.os Angeles,
has agreed to stay on as interim president until the per
manent job is filled.
