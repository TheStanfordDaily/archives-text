Vladimir Nabokov wrote his novels
first for himself, second for his wife,
Vera, third for no one at all. On the
subject of her literary influence,
he said: "Most of my works have
been dedicated to my wife, and her
picture has often been reproduced
by some mysterious means of
reflected color in the inner mirrors
of my books." Stacy Schiff's Vera
(Mrs. Vladimir Nabokov) is the
"utterly romantic" (New York
Magazine) story of the fifty-two
year marriage between the twentieth
century's most original writer and
a woman with an intellect and
devotion to literature equal to her
husband's. This intimate portrait of
Vra Nabokov, the woman who stood
at the center of the life and work of
the controversial author of Lolita,
is based on new material, Vladimir's
letters, Vra's diaries, and family
correspondence. Stacy Schiff's
Saint Exupery was a finalist for
the 1995 Pulitzer Prize. Her work
has appeared in The New Yorker,
The New York Times Book Review,
The Washington Post, and The
Times Literary Supplement.
She lives with her family in New York
City and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.
This book won the 1999 Pulitzer
Prize for biography.
