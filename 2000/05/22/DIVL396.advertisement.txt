PREGNANCY
More birth control options
have become available
since your parents' generation
than in all prior history. The
following methods protect
against unplanned pregnancies
to varying degrees.
Hormonal methods are recom
mended because of their effec
tiveness. But when used without
a condom, they do not protect
against HIV and other sexually
transmitted diseases (STDs).
Hormonal Methods
The Pill
Oral contraceptives are pills
containing two synthetic hor
mones that are taken 3 out of 4
weeks each month. Benefits:
Protection from uterine, ovarian
and colon cancer and osteo
porosis; lighter and shorter
periods; relief of menstrual
cramps. Most frequent side effects:
Vary; almost all can be relieved by
changing pills. Health history
may make taking the pill unwise.
Birth Control (BC) Rating:
Excellent. No STD protection.
Norplant
Norplant involves the place
ment of soft plastic tubes
containing progestin under the
skin of the upper arm for up to 5
years. Tubes can be removed at
any time to get pregnant.
Benefits: Convenience. Most
frequent side effects: Irregular
periods; occasional weight gain.
Norplant provides many of the
same health benefits as the
combined pill. BC Rating:
Excellent. No STD protection.
If all of these 28 Stanford
women had vaginal inter
course without using any of
the contraceptive methods
below, 24 of them would be
pregnant within a year.
Depo-Provera
Depo-Provera is an injection of
progesterone given once every
three months. Benefits: Conven
ience. Most frequent side effects:
Same as Norplant. BC Rating:
Excellent. No STD protection.
Barrier Methods
Condoms, diaphragms, sperm
icides and cervical caps prevent
sperm from reaching the egg.
Diaphragms and cervical caps
require fitting by a health care
practitioner. Latex condoms and
spermicides (containing non
oxynol-9) are available over-the
counter and are recommended to
protect against AIDS. Barrier
methods and spermicides offer
good protection from STD's
spread by body fluids, but offer
fair to no protection against STD's
spread by sexual touching (e.g.:
HPV, herpes, syphilis, and
molluscum).
Condoms
Condoms are thin protective
coverings made of latex, poly
urethane, or animal membrane
that fit tightly over the man's
erect penis to catch ejaculated
semen. BC Rating (combined with
spermicide): Good. There is also a
female condom that is inserted
into the vagina and also covers
part of the external genitals (no
spermicide needed). BC Rating:
Fair.
Diaphragms
A diaphragm is a rubber, dome
shaped device placed into the
vagina to hold spermicide around
the cervix. A cervical cap fits
directly on the cervix. Both are
used with spermicide, require
female involvement only, and can
be inserted ahead of time. Some
women get more bladder infec
tions with the diaphragm. BC
Rating: Fair.
Other Options
Abstinence
May make the heart grow
fonder. BC Rating: Excellent.
Spermicides
Used by itself; in cream, jelly or
suppository form. BC Rating:
Fair.
Rhythm Method
Natural family planning methods
require that couples calculate
when the woman is most likely to
become pregnant (during ovula
tion), and abstain from intercourse
during that time. BC Rating: Fair.
Intrauterine Devices (lUDs)
May be used after childbirth, but
can make an STD more severe.
BC Rating: Excellent.
Emergency
Contraception
The "Morning After" pill can be
used up to 72 hours AFTER
intercourse if you didn't use your
usual method effectively. BC
Rating: Good to Excellent.
You and your partner can discuss
the options with a health care
practitioner to find the best
method for you. Q
