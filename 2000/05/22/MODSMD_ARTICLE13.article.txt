Businesses need a way to handle
that volume of e-mail— to filter,
store and search it. Qualcomm Inc.,
whose Eudora product has lost mar
ket share to Microsoft's Outlook Ex
press and Netscape's Messenger, has
tried to differentiate itself from its
free competitors by building complex
rules- based filtering, sorting and
searching capabilities.
That's benefited Eudora users
such as Stanford University in Palo
Alto, Calif, which has seen its e-mail
volume grow by 30 percent in the past
year. 'They've really improved the
searching capabilities,' says Chris
Lundin, Stanford's director of help
desk operations.
