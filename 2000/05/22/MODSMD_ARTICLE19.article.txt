## The 						Stanford Daily ASSU election problems comes to a favorable end 
### 
Published Since 1891

FINALLY IT IS all over. A two month
election season characterized by name
calling and charge-pressing came to a
much needed conclusion at last lues
day's Constitutional Council meeting.
In voting to dismiss the four remaining cases
and in accepting the election results, the Coun
cil made the decision that reflects the best inter
ests of Stanford students.
For in this action, they acknowledged prob
lems in the election process while recognizing
that honoring the election results would be in
the best interests of both students and the orga
nization itself.
I he Council determined that the elections
were not "substantially affected" by the pres
ence of several unconstitutional campaign
restrictions. Those restrictions included limits

on the numbers of llyers posted in dorms,
campaign spending caps, a prohibition on
campaigning the week before election day,
and several regulations of candidate Web
sites.
As this process draws to a dose, the obvious
question remains whether or not all of this was
necessary. As we have noted iu the past, demer
its and the manner by which the ASSU estab
lished them were questionable at best. They
merited a substantial amount of investigation,
particularly because demerits appeared on the
spring elections ballot without the Graduate
Student Council — the graduate student arm of
the ASSU — ever voting on them.
Such practices placed little value on the grad
uate student voice and represented an obvious
violation of proper procedure, thus necessitat

ing the attention of the Constitutional Council.
Still, while an investigation of demerit situation
was indeed warranted, it remains questionable
whether the other charges brought against spe
cific individuals were in fact worthy of the Con
stitutional Council.
In the final analysis, the Constitutional
Council rightly recognized the folly of holding
a second set of elections. Not only would such a
decision go against the grain of student opinion
— one would be hard pressed to find more
than a few students in favor of holding the
ASSU elect ions all over again — students would
also be much less likely to vote in such an elec -
tion. Given this, the results of this election
would no doubt be even less representative of
the student body's views.
The Counc il has demonstrated its ability to

"do the right thing" when it matters the most.
In addition, in its efforts to handle the issues
surrounding this year's ASSU elections, such
as concerns that the language on the ASSU
Web site- made the recent proceedings appear
like a court trial, the Council has also proven
its ability to both recognize the validity of c on
cerns expressed by main students and to act
upon those concerns where possible —
promising, to start, to alter the language on
the ASSU Web site.
(changes like these, however small, indicate a
move in the right direction for the (Council and
the ASSU as a whole. Now, the organization
must look to next years election and make
every effort to learn from w hat transpired over
the past two months to make future elections
that much fairer and better run.
