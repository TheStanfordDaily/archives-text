While Texas (lov. (ieorge W.
Bush and Vice President A1 (.ore
traverse the country promoting
their respective Social Security
plans, main students right here at
home are entering the Social Se
curity debate as well.
Twelve students in Kconomics
Prof. John Shovcn's winter quar
ter freshman seminar, titled " The
Reform of Social Securitv." draft
ed a letter to each candidate out
lining suggestions for modifying
or reforming the current svstem.
" lb be honest, I'm sure [the
letter] didn't make a huge im
pact," freshman ( '.had (ioldberg
said. "But it does show that the
issue is out there, not just among
senior citizens."
After reading and researching
different aspects of the Social Se
curitv system, the students first
drew up their own plans. Ihe
final product "was a result of the
synthesis of all of those plans," he
said.
According to freshman Scott
Rasnuissen, the class was able to
put aside their philosophical dif
ferences and agree on five main
points of Social Security reform.
Students suggested raising the
retirement age from f>7 to 70, re
taining the system's re-distributive
elements in order to protect the
elderly, introducing private ac
counts , bringing in currently ex
empt state and local government
employees and increasing the
number of earnings years count
ed in determining benefits.
I he c lass emphasized that
these changes should take place
within the next four years.
Highlighting the political sen
sitivity of the issue, Rasnuissen
called Social Security "the third
rail of Americ an politics. | Its) like
a subwav train, you step on it and
you're dead."
I his past Monday, in a speech
to a senior citizens' center outside
Los Angeles, Bush outlined a plan
to introduce an element of priva
tization into the i urrent Social Se
curity svstetn. 1 "lie plan involves
allowing workers to invest part of
their payroll taxis in private ac
counts.
In his speech, Bush criticized
the Clinton-('«orc administration
and (lore's platform.
"[(lore] sa\s: 'II it ain't broke,
don't fix. it.' But in the lifetime of
some people in this room, it will he
broke, and we must lix it."

C lore responded on Wednesday
in an address to a conference of the
American Association of Retired
Persons in Orlando, Fla., saying
that Bush's plan could lead to "the
end of Social Security as we know
it."
According to the Gore cam
paign Web site, Gore plans to use
the i urrent budget surplus to pay
down the national debt, applying
the interest saved to shore up the
Social Security I rust Fund.
Both candidates propose a
number of smaller changes.
Among these, Gore would up
benefits for widows and home

makers while Bush proposes di
rect government investment in the
stock market and a large tax cut.
Rasmussen responded to each
candidate's plans.
"I would have liked to hear
more specifics on Bush's plan, but
I think that's in the right direction
. . . . the government by itself is
not being able to solve this prob
lem — we need to harness all of
the resources of our society."
On the other hand, Rasmussen
said he agrees with Gore's plans to
use the budget surplus towards
Social Security.
"We have an awful lot of money

and we have to use it,"he said.
However, Rasmussen contin
ued, "Gore has said we should
never change the retirement age .
... 1 don't think that's entirely re
alistic."
Goldberg is optimistic about
the role of college students in
shaping the future of the nation's
retirement system.
"Some people in college are
kind of apathetic about politics,
but there's definitely a segment of
the college population that cares
about politics, and that segment
really believes that Social Security
will be important in our lives."
