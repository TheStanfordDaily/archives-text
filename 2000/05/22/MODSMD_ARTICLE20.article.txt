# WHAT THE HECK I'M TALKING ABOUT
## Rethinking culture in film 
### 
My family loves movies. We like
action, we like comedy, and
we like the movies where we
can grab onto one of the char
acters and identify with him or her — see
something of that person in ourselves.
But it's rare — even unheard of — to
see characters that really represent us cul
turally, as Hispanics. From Charlton Hes-

ton in "Touch of Evil"
to Marisa Fomei in
"Perez Family" (she's
almost Latina), to "Mi
Familia," where a
majority of the cast was
I atino, I had yet to find
a latino character who
didn't seem like- a car
toon character — pre
dictable and linear,

without much complexity, doing every
thing the director thinks a I atino does.
Then this weekend, I saw the movie
"Luminarias." I here have been so few
American movies written, directed and
produced by Latinos. I was excited to set'
what the result would be. But within the
first 15 minutes I found myself squirming
in my seat — annoyed, uncomfortable,
even angry.
In one scene, the character Andrea says
she never felt like she belonged anywhere.
I recall that I didn't know where I
belonged when I first came to Stanford. 1
grew up in largely white suburbia, but
always had exposure to different ethnici
ties — I do, alter all, live in L.A. And my
extended family is a racial cornucopia. But
I didn't grow up in a Barrio, and that
made me often feel left out of the latino
community here. I know now that I could
have made more of an effort to fit in, but
it's a tough balance. Part of me fits perfect
ly in my sorority house, and another part
of me feels completely alien there. Ihe
same thing happens when I step into El
Centre) Chicano. I am never 100 percent
comfortable.
At first, I was frustrated with the film
because the principal characters — four
professional latinas — seemed to do noth
ing but talk about stereotypes; how latinos
do it better than white men. Or how Irene,
who wears such ridiculous outfits as a hal
ter top made out of two conveniently
placed mariachi hats, is giving up sex for
Lent as a tribute to Ia Virgencita whose
image she wears around her neck, hang
ing from her ears, or across her back in her
c ustom-designed fashions.
Fora while I felt like I was just watching
how many times they could throw the Vir
gin Mary, tequila or anti-white sentiment
into one sentence. Here was a ground
breaking precedent in latino filmmaking,
and "Luminarias" was just mocking lati
nas. These women were not me, or my
mother, or anyone in my family.

But some of the humor was oil-target,
and the movie started to break down my
defenses. At one point, Andrea brings her
white boyfriend to a family party in Fast
L.A. l he characters were all too familiar,
as well as the racially mixed, family
politicks Perez-style that end up with
everything from rice and beans lo sushi
and corned beef cabbage.
I found myself crying my heart out
when Andrea talks to her white boyfriend
about the rage she let-Is. the internal bat
tles she fights— not with the racism or dis
crimination, necessarily, but with her own
hang-lips about her culture. 1 really fell lor
Sofia when Lilly acc used her of being a
traitor to her people — of speaking poor
Spanish and denying her "roots."
In all my movie-going, never before
have 1 seen my most deeply entrenched
fears and insecurities about my idem it)
addressed on-screen. I was watching these
loin women, but I was crying for myself.
And 011 lhe way home, we talked about
it. My Mom gave my Dad a hard lime
about dating while girls in college. M\ 1 )ad
said there were no Litinas in college.
" 1 here was one," he said. "I remember
she was in a sorority, she was well-off, and
everyone knew who she was. But she was
untouchable."
"Well, then she wasn't really LATIN A,"
said my Mom. "I'm talking about, you
know — I litinas."
"That's me," I replied. What my Mom
said hit hard. I'm in a sorority. My parents
are fairly well-off. though tliev came from
poverty. "Am 1 not really Latina?" I'm
used to that kind of mentality, bin not
from my mom.
It follows that "Luminal ias" made us
uncomfortable. Bill ii made us think and
talk about who we are. Where do kids of
my unique generation belong — ethnic
minorities whose parents have made ii
big, and chosen to raise their kids in priv
ileged communities? I here's a lot of
resentment in the ethnic communities
themselves, but I still don't feel a complete
sense of belonging oil "the other side,"
either. I belong in the circles I create,
whether that's my family, or my close
friends. And I take part in the communi
ties, doing what 1 can to be understanding
and be understood.
I encourage you to check out ibis
movie, because it will make you think. It's
about finding a place to belong despite
your hang-ups or your rage, wherever ii
may come from. I applaud this film for
addressing new territory, and for making
me uncomfortable. Because being uncom
fortable is sometimes the best way to learn
something about yourself.
