Stanford should sever ties
with Webb Ranch
A lew days before John U. Hennessy's
designation as Stanford's president-elect,
598 members of the Stanford community
petitioned University President Gerhard
Gasper to refrain from signing a new
long-term lease on Webb Ranch where
farm workers continue to live and work
in poverty.
I lie reasoning behind the petition was
that Gasper's successor might want to
consider alternatives to perpetuating a
situation that has caused Stanford repeat
ed public embarrassment. A cover letter
to Provost llennessy cited a Stanford
Daily editorial that called on the Adminis
tration to rise above narrow legal obliga
tions and set a higher example for stu
dents and the wider community. The let
ter also asked whether it makes sense,
given the housing problem facing the
University, to lease acres of open
Stanford land to the Webbs fora farm
employing migrant and permanent-resi
dent farm workers.
To date, the petition signers have not
yet received a reply from the administra
tion, but there is still some hope that pres
ident-elect llennessy and the Stanford
Board of Trustees will want to review
conditions at Webb Ranch. According to
The Daily, the most recent labor contract
calls fora pay scale of $6.40 an hour to

$7.(50, with no benefits except some paid
vacation time. If lhe permanent farm
workers at Webb Ranch, to cite just one
alternative, were hired by Stanford as
assistant grounds keepers, they would
start at $13 an hour with full benefits
including a health plan. And Stanford
would be saved endless questions about
what a farm labor camp is doing on Stan
ford land.

Nation of Islam promotes anti-Semitism
I am writing to express my disappoint
ment in the Black Student Union's deri
sion to invite a speaker from the Nation
of Islam to deliver an address at Stanford
University.
Hie Nation of Islam is an anti-Semitic
hate group that propagates negative
stereotypes about Jews and claims a
worldwide Jewish conspiracy against
blacks. I he Nation's Historical Research
Department published a book, " I he
Secret Relationship Between Blacks and
Jews," that claims that Jews dominated

lilt' African slave trade, and that Kuro
pean persecution ol Jews was therefore
justified. I lie Jews' participation in the
slave trade, particularly tlieii trafficking
in non-Jewish slaves, incited the moral
indignation of Kurope's (.entile popula
tion. The Europeans reacted by taxing
the Jews and some were expelled from
their host countries.
Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the
Nation of Islam, claims that Jews are
wicked deceivers of the American people.
He continues, in a 19% address, "You
are the synagogue of Satan, and you have
wrapped your tentacles around the U.S.
government . . . know that Allah will cru
cify you."
farrakhan attacks Jewish involvement
in the civil rights movement as well, men
tioning: "Any time the Jewish philan
thropists financed the NAACP, they have
a stake in what the NAACI' does. So the
leaders of that organization have to kow
tow to those kinds of powers . . . We will
never he free until we are free of that
kind of control."
Nor is the Nation's bigotry limited to
hatred of Jews. At the Black Holocaust
Nationhood Conference, held ;is a pre
lude to the Million Man March, klialid
Muhammad, a minister of the Nation of
Islam and its former spokesman,
announced Klijah Muhammad taught
that the Pope of Rome is the anti-Christ.
The BSU invited Ishmael Muham
mad, Farrakhan's personal assistant to
deliver the keynote address for its Mal
colm X Week commemoration. Inviting
this bigot to speak on campus legitimizes
bigotry, and is incredibly disrespectful to
the various ethnic communities the
Nation of Islam directs its hate speech
against. Academic freedom requires us to
listen to dissenting viewpoints and ensure
healthy and open academic debate. It
does not require us to invite bigots on to
our campus, to treat them as honored
guests or to use student fees to support
their message. We do not invite Jerry Fal
well's personal assistant to address us, nor
do we pay an honorarium to the vice
president of Bob Jones University. Yet
their vitriol is mild compared to that of
the Nation of Islam. The BSU owes the
entire Stanford community an apology
for sponsoring this speaker.

Manipulation of facts on the
Arab-Israeli issue
I am writing in response to Hussein
Kanji's ("Critics not justified in writing off
Muslim Student Awareness Network dis
play as result of ongoing conflict," May
18) half-page anti-Israeli diatribe. As with
most of the anti-Israeli diatribes we have
seen this year, he attempts to portray
Israel as a savage aggressor in 1967.
The Six-Day War of 19(37 was, in fact,

a textbook example of a pre-emptive
strike. For two decades, Fgypt, Syria and
Jordan had the publicly avowed goal of
destroying Israel, and in the months lead
ing up to the war, Nasser of Fgypt made
several speeches proclaiming the "forth
coming extermination of Israel." On May
18, Nasser demanded the withdrawal of
the United Nations peacekeeping force,
virtually announcing that he was about to
attack.
What was Israel to do? Sit back and
wait to be slaughtered? Instead, through
a brilliantly planned and well executed
move it survived in the only possible
manner, destroying 400 Arab planes on
June 5.
Kanji accuses Israel of violating several
accords and charters. Rather than take
half a page explaining why 1 disagree, let
me instead ask you this: Suppose Fgypt,
Syria, and Jordan had won the war and
succeeded in their goal of destroying
Israel. Can you tell me that they would
have been in compliance with every
accord and charter? I didn't think so.
He also cites some UN resolutions
against Israel, yet it is common knowl
edge that the UN has become a forum for
Arab nations to pass these resolutions, as
they can outvote Israel every time. UN
Secretary General Kofi Annan himself
admitted this several months ago in New
York. The fact that the UN chose to hold
its annual meeting on Yom kippur last
year makes its inherent bias obvious. It is
a cruel irony, considering that the UN
was created in the wake of the I lolocaust
to help prevent such discrimination.
In his half-page, Kanji mentions 10
words of truth: "Fven in times of war,
there are rules that apply." However, I
wonder how anxious he is to apply those
words to the Yom Kippur War of 197'}.
Egypt and Syria attacked Israel while an

overwhelming percentage of the popula
tion was in the synagogue and only 400
reservists in 30 tanks were stationed on
the border. Yet Egypt and Syria lost the
war anyway. Then Israel gave back most
of the land at the urging of the United
States, including the Sinai and the Sue/
Canal.
Somehow, Egypt is proud of this.
When I visited last summer, 1 was
shocked to see many bridges and roads
commemorating '6 October, the day in
1973 when they cowardly attacked dur
ing Yom Kippur. This represents more
than a disagreement on historical facts,
and shows why the road to peace has
been so difficult.

Debate over MSAN banner turned
into finger pointing debacle
Reading the editorial section of 1 he
Daily over the past week, I have been
overwhelmed by the sheer number of
misrepresentations and misinterpreta
tions of facts presented l>\ the Muslim
Students Awareness Network and its sup
porters. In an attempt to make Israel look
like a murderous villain, numerous refer
ences have been made to the wars of 1948
and 1967.
My first reaction was to write a letter in
the form of a rebuttal to the accusations
made. 1 was going to emphasize the fact
that in 1948, just after the c reation of the
State of Israel, five Arab nations invaded
the young state. I bis led to the many
dreadful consequences already discussed
in the previous letters.
I was also going to write about the fact
that in 1907, prior to Israel's attack on

Egypt, |ordan and Syria (Hussein kanji's
letter, "Critics not justified in writing off
MSAN display as result of ongoing con
flict," May IS) Egyptian president Naser
closed the Strait of I iran to Israeli ships.
In accordance to international law, this is
considered an ac t of war.
Furthermore, Naser mobilized his
armed forces and moved them to the
Sinai Peninsula, as well as asked the I N
forces stationed there at the moment to
move out.
I was also going to write about the
Hebron (a town that is so often in the
media spotlight as an example of Israeli
aggression) massacre of 1929, when the
entire Jewish population of the town was
murdered by an armed group of Pales
tinians. I was going to write about the
Yom kippur War, when Israel s Arab
neighbors attacked Israel on her holiest
day. But, after some thought, 1 reconsid
ered.
Writing about these events would only
aid in the finger pointing that is taking
place. What started with a debate whether
the MSAN banner was appropriate lias
turned into figuring out who has done
more wrong.
What began with a student group
putting up a banner lias turned into a
political argument invoking such issues
as an "obvious pro-Israel bias" in the L'.S.
government.
In short, the locus lias completely shift
ed. In my opinion, this has great 1) com
plicated the original argument and
brought it to a point where a solution will
not be found. Indeed, if the accusations
and rebuttals lead to anything, ii is going
to be an even more strained relationship
between the two communities.
So in conclusion, I would like to say the
following: the MSAN certain!) has a right
to express its view and to educate people

about the situation in Israel, i do, howev
er, think putting up tombstones and the
figures about "I .S. tax dollars spent" is
an extremely poor move. Sadly for both
sides, for every Arab tombstone, the Jew
ish community can put up many of its
own — the traged\ has been profound
for both peoples.
I challenge anyone to please explain to
me how such a display of "truth" has even
the slightest hint of friendship, brother
hood, reconciliation, or peace. 1 think
MSAN can do manv things to educate the
public about the situation, but putting up
a banners of the kind that was put up in
White Plaza will onlv advocate conflict,
not promote peace.
Lastly, tor those seriously interested in
the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict 1
can recommend a book by the renowned
British historian, Martin Gilbert "Atlas of
the Arab-Israeli conflict."
