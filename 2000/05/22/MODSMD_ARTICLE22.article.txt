Stanford should sever ties
with Webb Ranch
A lew days before John U. Hennessy's
designation as Stanford's president-elect,
598 members of the Stanford community
petitioned University President Gerhard
Gasper to refrain from signing a new
long-term lease on Webb Ranch where
farm workers continue to live and work
in poverty.
I lie reasoning behind the petition was
that Gasper's successor might want to
consider alternatives to perpetuating a
situation that has caused Stanford repeat
ed public embarrassment. A cover letter
to Provost llennessy cited a Stanford
Daily editorial that called on the Adminis
tration to rise above narrow legal obliga
tions and set a higher example for stu
dents and the wider community. The let
ter also asked whether it makes sense,
given the housing problem facing the
University, to lease acres of open
Stanford land to the Webbs fora farm
employing migrant and permanent-resi
dent farm workers.
To date, the petition signers have not
yet received a reply from the administra
tion, but there is still some hope that pres
ident-elect llennessy and the Stanford
Board of Trustees will want to review
conditions at Webb Ranch. According to
The Daily, the most recent labor contract
calls fora pay scale of $6.40 an hour to

$7.(50, with no benefits except some paid
vacation time. If lhe permanent farm
workers at Webb Ranch, to cite just one
alternative, were hired by Stanford as
assistant grounds keepers, they would
start at $13 an hour with full benefits
including a health plan. And Stanford
would be saved endless questions about
what a farm labor camp is doing on Stan
ford land.

Nation of Islam promotes anti-Semitism
I am writing to express my disappoint
ment in the Black Student Union's deri
sion to invite a speaker from the Nation
of Islam to deliver an address at Stanford
University.
Hie Nation of Islam is an anti-Semitic
hate group that propagates negative
stereotypes about Jews and claims a
worldwide Jewish conspiracy against
blacks. I he Nation's Historical Research
Department published a book, " I he
Secret Relationship Between Blacks and
Jews," that claims that Jews dominated

lilt' African slave trade, and that Kuro
pean persecution ol Jews was therefore
justified. I lie Jews' participation in the
slave trade, particularly tlieii trafficking
in non-Jewish slaves, incited the moral
indignation of Kurope's (.entile popula
tion. The Europeans reacted by taxing
the Jews and some were expelled from
their host countries.
Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the
Nation of Islam, claims that Jews are
wicked deceivers of the American people.
He continues, in a 19% address, "You
are the synagogue of Satan, and you have
wrapped your tentacles around the U.S.
government . . . know that Allah will cru
cify you."
farrakhan attacks Jewish involvement
in the civil rights movement as well, men
tioning: "Any time the Jewish philan
thropists financed the NAACP, they have
a stake in what the NAACI' does. So the
leaders of that organization have to kow
tow to those kinds of powers . . . We will
never he free until we are free of that
kind of control."
Nor is the Nation's bigotry limited to
hatred of Jews. At the Black Holocaust
Nationhood Conference, held ;is a pre
lude to the Million Man March, klialid
Muhammad, a minister of the Nation of
Islam and its former spokesman,
announced Klijah Muhammad taught
