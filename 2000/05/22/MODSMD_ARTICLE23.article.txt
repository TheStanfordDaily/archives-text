# Knight Fellow reflects on the wonders of a year at Stanford
## 
### ERNESTO GARCIA CALDERON GUEST COLUMNIST 
OK, here I am, at the end of a year as a Knight
Fellow at Stanford University. And this is a 700-word
piece about — uh, sorry, what was it supposed to be
about again?
. . . OK, so here 1 am, writing this 700-word piece
for I he Stanford Daily, "The Peninsula's Oldest
Morning Newspaper," as both a farewell and a reflec
tion about our future.
Every year, up to 20 journalists from the U.S. and
abroad have the privilege to come to Stanford for an
extraordinary year of learning, reading, practicing
sports, traveling, making friends — in a word, grow
ing. 1 he coveted John S. Knight Fellowship is unmis
takably one of the highest moments of any journal
ist's career.
Many things make this year unique — the odd
mixture of serene suburban life and fast-paced start
ups all around; the incredibly vast academic
resources Stanford possesses; the übiquitous dot-com
that has become Silicon Valley's trademark. For for
eign citizens like myself, discovering California has

been one of the most remarkable experiences in our
lives. Fora journalist, just being here was a treat in
itself.
Being a journalist is a huge challenge; no doubt
about it. The deadline. The pressure. Your editor
wants your copy not soon, not now, but yesterday.
The facts. Check once. The charts. The pressure.
Double-check. The pictures are finally here. One last
minute detail. The pressure. The deadline. Now you
need to triple-check. The deadline. I lie pressure.
The passion.
After all, isn't passion what journalism is all about?
Sometimes, however, challenges are bigger. Being
a journalist in a country like mine, for example, can
be really tough. (Even dangerous. May this piece be
a tribute to those brave reporters who went far
beyond the call of duty and lost their lives, but never
their principles.)
Naturally, my country, Peru, has its share of excel
lent journalists: reporters and editors who are pas
sionate about their jobs, accurate in communicating
their facts and figures, frequently centered when the
time comes to make tough decisions.
But somehow 1 think we lack a vision for tomor

row; being already a part of the twenty-first century,
Latin American journalism cannot look inward only.
It should open up to the world.
This was the main philosophy behind my applying
fora Knight Fellowship at Stanford a year ago. We
the I .atin American journalists must not be isolated
anymore: we must follow — or, even better, set — the
global trend, Latin America is more than just tradi
tion, potential and hope. We are present and future.
We are proud to belong to a generation of "glob
al" journalists prepared to fight all battles: we can be
field reporters, copy editors, producers, anchorpeo
ple, even graphic designers if needed. Radio, televi
sion and the printed media are not uncharted terri
tories for lis.
And, during our year, Silicon Valley showcased the
incredible possibilities of the World Wide Web as the
media outlet of the future — designed not to replace
the "old" mass media, but very likely to redefine our
current understanding of the word journalism.
To experience a global environment like the Bay
Area's first hand is as enriching as it gets. Here, peo
ple from literally all over the world blend to form a
single community, weaving their different perspec

tives, thoughts, beliefs, and hopes into a huge, "inter
national" quilt. We all feel like "citizens of the world."
This might be globalization at its best.
Are we journalists able to sit down and ponder
these things? 1 certainly hope so. Could we do better
with a sense of globalization? Undoubtedly, the
answer is yes. And that might be the ultimate lesson
of our fellowship this year.
So many more things to say, and so little space left.
Just a final note about the opportunity we had to cel
ebrate the millennium in Silicon Valley: we witnessed
the dawn of a new era at the outpost of a new, global
frontier. (OK, you're right, the 21st century actually
begins in 2001. But — anyway.) It's been a wonder
ful year and a truly fascinating ride. See? I even got £
piece published in The Daily. Is anything cooler than
that? Go figure.
Well —
You asked for 700 words, didn't you? (Lan we
count 'em now?
