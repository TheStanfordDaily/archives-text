# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## New student judicial process another important Casper legacy 
### MARC WAIS GUEST COLUMNIST 
When Gerhard Casper announced in
mid-September that he would be step
ping down as Stanford president, stu
dents, faculty, staff and alumni began to
reflect on his many accomplishments.
Rightly, much of the attention has
focused on his significant enhancements
to undergraduate education and the cre
ation of the Stanford Graduate Fellow
ship Program to support graduate stu
dents in the sciences and engineering.
Other important foci over Casper's
tenure have been the rebuilding of the
campus after the 1989 earthquake, and,
of course, helping to restore the Universi
ty's reputation in the aftermath of the
indirect cost difficulty.
Somewhat lost in the shuffle has been
Casper's leadership in an area of student
and academic life which impacts every
student and faculty member each and
every day.
In the mid 19905, many at the Univer
sity believed that the Honor Code was not
effectively promoted as a core value of
this institution and that the process for
adjudicating alleged violations of any stu
dent conduct rule was bureaucratic, inef
ficient and ineffective.
This view was the result of the Univer-

sity's continued use of a
judicial system defined
by the Legislative and
judicial Charter of
1968 which, not sur
prisingly, reflected the
turbulent times in
which it was created. In
time, it grew overly
legalistic and time con
suming.

In February of 1996, Casper convened
the Committee of Fifteen (C-15), com
posed of six students, six faculty mem
bers, and three stall members. Casper
asked the Committee to review and mod
ify, as appropriate, the 1968 Charter.
Under the leadership of Geophysics Prof.
Mark Zoback, and after exhaustive stud
ies, discussion and analysis, the Commit
tee proposed the Student Judicial Char
ter of 1997.
This new charter was radically differ
ent from the 1968 Charter, symbolized by
the name change alone. It was quickly
approved by the ASSU, the Faculty Sen
ate, and Casper — who all saw the poten
tial benefits the new charter presented. It
went into effect in January of 1998.
I was recently asked to review the
impact of the 1997 Charter on our judi
cial process and report my findings to the
Faculty Senate. After a careful review of

judicial files and records, and after dis
cussion with students, faculty and staff, I
was able to inform the Faculty Senate ear
lier this month that the 1997 Charter had
ac hieved live major objectives. All of these
objectives have enhanced Stanford's judi
cial process.
First, the new system restored to stu
dents the central role in establishing judi
cial policy and adjudicating cases through
their ac tive involvement on the Board on
Judicial Affairs and in judicial Panels. In
fact, students make up a majority of all
Judicial Panels (composed of four stu
dents, one faculty member and one stall
member) and one always serves as chair.
These Panels determine guilt or inno
cence, and in cases iu which a student is
louud guilty of violating the I lonor Code
or the Fundamental Standard, these Pan
els also determine sanctions.
Second, the new system ensures broad
University participation of students, fac
ulty, and stall. All students charged with
violating the Honor Code or the Funda
mental Standard now must have their
case adjudicated by a Judicial Panel,
instead of having the option of having
their uncontested case heard by the Dean
of Students or his designee.
(In years prior to the new systems,
approximately one student a year elected
to have his / her case reviewed l>\ a stu

dent-faculty panel — the Stanford Judi
cial Council).
I 'hi rd, the new judicial process has a
greater educational Foundation, provid
ing students with greater opportunities
for teachable moments.
Fourth, through a new and increased
staffing structure in the Judicial Affairs
Office (JAO), the University has stopped
the practice of having a single individual
assume the combined roles of neutral
advisor and the investigator / prosecuting
officer that created ambiguity and the
appearance of conflicts of interest under
the old system.
And fifth, the new system has become
more timely and efficient. In the old sys
tem it often took the Judicial Affairs
()ffice more than 100 days to investigate ;i
complaint, file a charge, adjudicate the
case, and notify the student of the final
outcome.
This current year that same process
has averaged only 57 days. Students, fac
ulty and staff are to be commended for
their time, effort and dedication in suc
cessfully implementing the 1997 Student
Judicial Charter.
While these accomplishments are
noteworthy, we still have room for
improvement in developing and cultivat
ing a campus climate which promotes an
ethos of trust, integrity, and above all, a

respect for the Honor (lode. The heist
way to accomplish this is through on
going education and dialogue.
We should be asking each other some
tough questions, such as: What consti
tutes academic dishonesty — especially jn
this technological age? What is the right
balance between a student's right to con
fidentiality and the community's right to
know? Should a student be expected to
file a complaint against another student
he witnesses cheating or she suspects
forged an advisor's name on a study list?
These questions need to be thought
through on an individual basis and dis
cussed privately, as well as in public set
tings. Thoughtful reflection and public
dialogue will help us as a coinmunitv
translate Stanford's core values of trust,
honesty, and respect into daily action.
This is especially important as we
approach the end of the quarter and final
exams, as many of our Honor Code vio
lations come about as a result of students
sometimes making bad decisions ata time
of great stress which they later regret.
While Casper's overhaul of our judicial
system may not be as splashy as some of
his other achievements, it surely reflects
his moral and intellectual influence on
this institution.

tee proposed the Student Judicial Char
ter of 1997.
This new charter was radically differ
ent from the 1968 Charter, symbolized by
the name change alone. It was quickly
approved by the ASSU, the Faculty Sen
ate, and Casper — who all saw the poten
tial benefits the new charter presented. It
went into effect in January of 1998.
I was recently asked to review the
impact of the 1997 Charter on our judi
cial process and report my findings to the
Faculty Senate. After a careful review of

judicial files and records, and after dis
cussion with students, faculty and staff, I
was able to inform the Faculty Senate ear
lier this month that the 1997 Charter had
ac hieved live major objectives. All of these
objectives have enhanced Stanford's judi
cial process.
First, the new system restored to stu
dents the central role in establishing judi
cial policy and adjudicating cases through
their ac tive involvement on the Board on
Judicial Affairs and in judicial Panels. In
fact, students make up a majority of all
Judicial Panels (composed of four stu
dents, one faculty member and one stall
member) and one always serves as chair.
These Panels determine guilt or inno
cence, and in cases iu which a student is
louud guilty of violating the I lonor Code
or the Fundamental Standard, these Pan
els also determine sanctions.
Second, the new system ensures broad
University participation of students, fac
ulty, and stall. All students charged with
violating the Honor Code or the Funda
mental Standard now must have their
case adjudicated by a Judicial Panel,
instead of having the option of having
their uncontested case heard by the Dean
of Students or his designee.
(In years prior to the new systems,
approximately one student a year elected
to have his / her case reviewed l>\ a stu

dent-faculty panel — the Stanford Judi
cial Council).
I 'hi rd, the new judicial process has a
greater educational Foundation, provid
ing students with greater opportunities
for teachable moments.
Fourth, through a new and increased
staffing structure in the Judicial Affairs
Office (JAO), the University has stopped
the practice of having a single individual
assume the combined roles of neutral
advisor and the investigator / prosecuting
officer that created ambiguity and the
appearance of conflicts of interest under
the old system.
And fifth, the new system has become
more timely and efficient. In the old sys
tem it often took the Judicial Affairs
()ffice more than 100 days to investigate ;i
complaint, file a charge, adjudicate the
case, and notify the student of the final
outcome.
This current year that same process
has averaged only 57 days. Students, fac
ulty and staff are to be commended for
their time, effort and dedication in suc
cessfully implementing the 1997 Student
Judicial Charter.
While these accomplishments are
noteworthy, we still have room for
improvement in developing and cultivat
ing a campus climate which promotes an
ethos of trust, integrity, and above all, a

respect for the Honor (lode. The heist
way to accomplish this is through on
going education and dialogue.
We should be asking each other some
tough questions, such as: What consti
tutes academic dishonesty — especially jn
this technological age? What is the right
balance between a student's right to con
fidentiality and the community's right to
know? Should a student be expected to
file a complaint against another student
he witnesses cheating or she suspects
forged an advisor's name on a study list?
These questions need to be thought
through on an individual basis and dis
cussed privately, as well as in public set
tings. Thoughtful reflection and public
dialogue will help us as a coinmunitv
translate Stanford's core values of trust,
honesty, and respect into daily action.
This is especially important as we
approach the end of the quarter and final
exams, as many of our Honor Code vio
lations come about as a result of students
sometimes making bad decisions ata time
of great stress which they later regret.
While Casper's overhaul of our judicial
system may not be as splashy as some of
his other achievements, it surely reflects
his moral and intellectual influence on
this institution.
