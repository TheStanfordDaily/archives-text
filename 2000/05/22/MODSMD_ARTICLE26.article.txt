A THENS, Ga. â€” With the way
the No. 1 Stanford men's tennis
team has been playing in the 2000
NCAA Team Championships,
maybe they should just end the
tournament early and hand the
Cardinal its record 17th national
title.
After a pair of victories over No.
16 seed Minnesota and No. 9 seed
Texas Christian this weekend, Stan
ford (26-1) finds itself in a familiar
situation: the semifinals of the team
tournament.
The Cardinal will play No. 4 seed
Florida (28-3) at 1 p.m. today for the
opportunity to compete for its fifth
national championship in the past

to tie the score at 1-1, the Cardinal
battled back. Both Hippensteel and
Scott came back after losing the first
sets of their respective matches to
give the Cardinal a 3-1 lead.
Hippensteel, ranked No. 11 in
the country, defeated No. 96 Scott
Edding, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, while Scott
outlasted Jimmy Haney, 4-6,6-3,6-
2.
"I just tried to stay positive and
