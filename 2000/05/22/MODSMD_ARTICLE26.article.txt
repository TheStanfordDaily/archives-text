### SAMEER AHMED STAFF WRITER 
A THENS, Ga. — With the way
the No. 1 Stanford men's tennis
team has been playing in the 2000
NCAA Team Championships,
maybe they should just end the
tournament early and hand the
Cardinal its record 17th national
title.
After a pair of victories over No.
16 seed Minnesota and No. 9 seed
Texas Christian this weekend, Stan
ford (26-1) finds itself in a familiar
situation: the semifinals of the team
tournament.
The Cardinal will play No. 4 seed
Florida (28-3) at 1 p.m. today for the
opportunity to compete for its fifth
national championship in the past
six years.
Stanford advanced to the semifi
nals with a hard-fought 4-1 win over
TCU yesterday afternoon.
The Cardinal jumped out to an
early 1-0 lead after winning two
doubles matches.
Juniors Ali Ansari and Scotty
Scott dismantled Antonio Gordon
and Sebastian lannariello, 8-1, at

No. 3 doubles while sophomore K.J.
Hippensteel and freshman David
Martin, the No. 34 tandem in the
nation, clinched the doubles point
by defeating Esteban Carril and
Trace Fielding, 8-6, at No. 2.
Stanford did not come out that
strong in singles, however, and a
TCU upset looked possible. The
Horned Frogs won the first sets in
four of the six singles matches.
After Petr Koula, ranked No. 97
in the nation, beat Ansari, 6-4, 6-0,
to tie the score at 1-1, the Cardinal
battled back. Both Hippensteel and
Scott came back after losing the first
sets of their respective matches to
give the Cardinal a 3-1 lead.
Hippensteel, ranked No. 11 in
the country, defeated No. 96 Scott
Edding, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, while Scott
outlasted Jimmy Haney, 4-6,6-3,6-
2.
"I just tried to stay positive and
hopefully try to turn things
around," Scott said about losing
the first set of his singles match. "1

the second and third sets. 1 just
