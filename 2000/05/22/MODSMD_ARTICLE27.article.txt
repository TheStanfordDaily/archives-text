# Cal edges golf for final berth in NCAA meet
## 
### MATT LONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
FRESNO — The dry, scorching heat of Riverbend
Golf Course on Saturday was the scene of a series of
conclusions for the No. 25 Stanford men's golf team.
The curtains were drawn on retiring head coach
\Vally Goodwin's 40-year career, senior captain
Dusty Brett's time as a Cardinal golfer and the 1999-
2000 team's quest fora berth in the NCAA Champi
onships.
Stanford finished in 10th place at the NCAA West
Regional in Fresno May 18-20, losing in a playoff late
Saturday evening to Cal, just missing qualifying for
the NCAAs.
The three-team tiebreaker consisted of Idaho,
Cal and Stanford, all of whom finished at 1-over on
the tournament. The playoff format sent each play
er to a different par-4, and all were to tee off con
currently. Scores would be counted and the teams
would be notified whether they were eliminated or
should move on to the next hole. The young Idaho
team lost on the opening hole, and two holes later
Cal grabbed the final NCAA berth, capping the Car
dinal season and the career of one of college golf's
most revered coaches.
Fhe Regional consisted of 27 teams, including
eight in the top 25, with 10 spots to Opeilka, Ala., the
site of the NCAA Championships, on the line. Each
team brought five golfers, and counted its best four
scores of the day toward its three rounds. Goodwin
predicted that each team's position would change lit
tle throughout the tournament, so the team deemed
the first 18 holes of play as extremely crucial to its
qualifying hopes.
Thursday Stanford, paired with UCLA and the
University of Pacific, was the last team to tee off,
forced to negotiate Riverbend's afternoon sun and
the rock-hard greens that resulted. The Cardinal fin
ished at three over par, tied for 11th place with Cal
and Oregon State. Junior Jimmy Lee hit 16 greens in
regulation, and led Stanford with a 1-under 71, fol
lowed by junior Eric Dahlberg's and sophomore
Philip Rowe's 725.
Fhe squad checked in early in preparation for Fri
day's 7:12 a.m. tee time, the first of the day, and all
realized improvement was needed to be in position
to challenge fora berth.
The Cardinal commenced play at the 10th hole in
the second round, and started the morning on the
back nine holes, dubbed by Regional spectators and
participants alike as the easy side of the course.
Day two was highlighted by junior Alex Aragon's
heavy-hitting round of 70. A de
termined Aragon shot eight
strokes better than his previous
day's score, sensing the urgency
of the situation. Brett and Rowe
carded 71s, giving Stanford a
score of 3-under for the day as the
Cardinal remained in I Ith place
with playing partner UCIA at
even par, three strokes behind
Cal and Idaho, the ninth-place
teams. Goodwin's prophecy had
so far rang true, and Stanford re
alized that the final round would
be a dogfight for the last two or
three spots in the NCAAs.
On the eve of Saturday's
round, Goodwin said the team
needed "a five- or six-under to
qualify" and told the players of
the need for "defensive golf on
the sucker pin positions" — those
right on the edge of the green.
"What 1 told them was simple,"
Goodwin said. "If on the range
and the* first few holes their irons
are accurate, go straight for every
pin. If not, then make a decision
to go for the pin or the middle of
the green."
The Cardinal teed off in the
mid-morning with UCLA and
Idaho, two squads it would need to
pass to have a chance at qualifica
tion. Again the team started on
hole 10, so it needed to accumulate
as many birdies as possible in its

first nine holes to contend, as the
front nine was providing little op
portunity for low score with its
tough pin positions and thick
rough.
I lie par-Jive 15th hole saw
UCLA's fravis Johnson make a
30-foot eagle chip, and Aragon
countered with a birdie, while the
other Cardinal duffers paired.
After five holes, both the Bruins
and Stanford stood at 2-under, in
10th place, as Cal dropped to
even with a few bogeys.
I lole 1 (S, a par-four with a split
fairway, had dealt bad scores to
many in the two preceding
rounds, and when Rowe teed oil,
disaster struck. Using a three
wood to ensure accuracy, Rowe's
first shot went into the gully in the
middle of the fairway, and was
missed by the spotter. After a
fruitless 10-minute search, Rowe
was sent back to tee oil, only to
find his ball once again in the high
weeds. His approach landed in a
bunker, and after another shot to
reach the green and a two-putt he
finished with an eight.
Luckily, Aragon was on again
and stood at two under, and l.ee's
accurate approach shots had him
at one-under.
By the time they had reached
the sixth hole, Dahlberg, Aragon
and Brett had carded multiple
bogeys and the leaderboard
showed Stanford at five over, be
hind Cal, Pacific, Idaho and
UCLA, and five strokes out of the
lOth-place pileup.

The last three holes would
prove to decide Stanford's liite,
and Rowe took it into his own
hands to deliver the Cardinal with
birdies on seven and eight. Add to
that mix an Idaho double bogey
and a I CIA decline, and Stanford
again was in the heat of the race.
Hole 9 had all Cardinal
golfers shoot par, Lee just miss
ing an eight-foot birdie putt, and
Rowe burying a downhill 15-
footer to save par. Aragon again
led with a 70 and Lee followed
with a 72. The team watched
Idaho double-bogey hole nine,
and minutes later found itself at
one over, in a three-way tie for
ninth place with Cal and Idaho,
with a tiebreaker scheduled for
the end of the day.
As the Stanford team headed
back to its hotel to rest up before
the evening round, Brett found
an irony in how "a team score
after 54 holes comes down to a tic
and one hole for the season" and
acknowledged his nervousness
and that he had "nothing to lose,
1 just got to go for it."
Upon a return to the course in
preparation for the 7 p.m. play
off. the team was shocked to
learn that Repperdine, behind
Michael Beard's course record
65, had come back from a seven
stroke deficit to finish at even
par. The playoff would now send
just one of the three teams to Al
abama, and with one stray
stroke, the Cardinal's season had
come to an end.

to go for the pin or the middle of
the green."
The Cardinal teed off in the
mid-morning with UCLA and
Idaho, two squads it would need to
pass to have a chance at qualifica
tion. Again the team started on
hole 10, so it needed to accumulate
as many birdies as possible in its

first nine holes to contend, as the
front nine was providing little op
portunity for low score with its
tough pin positions and thick
rough.
I lie par-Jive 15th hole saw
UCLA's fravis Johnson make a
30-foot eagle chip, and Aragon
countered with a birdie, while the
other Cardinal duffers paired.
After five holes, both the Bruins
and Stanford stood at 2-under, in
10th place, as Cal dropped to
even with a few bogeys.
I lole 1 (S, a par-four with a split
fairway, had dealt bad scores to
many in the two preceding
rounds, and when Rowe teed oil,
disaster struck. Using a three
wood to ensure accuracy, Rowe's
first shot went into the gully in the
middle of the fairway, and was
missed by the spotter. After a
fruitless 10-minute search, Rowe
was sent back to tee oil, only to
find his ball once again in the high
weeds. His approach landed in a
bunker, and after another shot to
reach the green and a two-putt he
finished with an eight.
Luckily, Aragon was on again
and stood at two under, and l.ee's
accurate approach shots had him
at one-under.
By the time they had reached
the sixth hole, Dahlberg, Aragon
and Brett had carded multiple
bogeys and the leaderboard
showed Stanford at five over, be
hind Cal, Pacific, Idaho and
UCLA, and five strokes out of the
lOth-place pileup.

The last three holes would
prove to decide Stanford's liite,
and Rowe took it into his own
hands to deliver the Cardinal with
birdies on seven and eight. Add to
that mix an Idaho double bogey
and a I CIA decline, and Stanford
again was in the heat of the race.
Hole 9 had all Cardinal
golfers shoot par, Lee just miss
ing an eight-foot birdie putt, and
Rowe burying a downhill 15-
footer to save par. Aragon again
led with a 70 and Lee followed
with a 72. The team watched
Idaho double-bogey hole nine,
and minutes later found itself at
one over, in a three-way tie for
ninth place with Cal and Idaho,
with a tiebreaker scheduled for
the end of the day.
As the Stanford team headed
back to its hotel to rest up before
the evening round, Brett found
an irony in how "a team score
after 54 holes comes down to a tic
and one hole for the season" and
acknowledged his nervousness
and that he had "nothing to lose,
1 just got to go for it."
Upon a return to the course in
preparation for the 7 p.m. play
off. the team was shocked to
learn that Repperdine, behind
Michael Beard's course record
65, had come back from a seven
stroke deficit to finish at even
par. The playoff would now send
just one of the three teams to Al
abama, and with one stray
stroke, the Cardinal's season had
come to an end.
FRESNO — The dry, scorching heat of Riverbend
Golf Course on Saturday was the scene of a series of
conclusions for the No. 25 Stanford men's golf team.
The curtains were drawn on retiring head coach
\Vally Goodwin's 40-year career, senior captain
Dusty Brett's time as a Cardinal golfer and the 1999-
2000 team's quest fora berth in the NCAA Champi
onships.
Stanford finished in 10th place at the NCAA West
Regional in Fresno May 18-20, losing in a playoff late
Saturday evening to Cal, just missing qualifying for
the NCAAs.
The three-team tiebreaker consisted of Idaho,
Cal and Stanford, all of whom finished at 1-over on
the tournament. The playoff format sent each play
er to a different par-4, and all were to tee off con
currently. Scores would be counted and the teams
would be notified whether they were eliminated or
should move on to the next hole. The young Idaho
team lost on the opening hole, and two holes later
Cal grabbed the final NCAA berth, capping the Car
dinal season and the career of one of college golf's
most revered coaches.
Fhe Regional consisted of 27 teams, including
eight in the top 25, with 10 spots to Opeilka, Ala., the
site of the NCAA Championships, on the line. Each
team brought five golfers, and counted its best four
scores of the day toward its three rounds. Goodwin
predicted that each team's position would change lit
tle throughout the tournament, so the team deemed
the first 18 holes of play as extremely crucial to its
qualifying hopes.
Thursday Stanford, paired with UCLA and the
University of Pacific, was the last team to tee off,
forced to negotiate Riverbend's afternoon sun and
the rock-hard greens that resulted. The Cardinal fin
ished at three over par, tied for 11th place with Cal
and Oregon State. Junior Jimmy Lee hit 16 greens in
regulation, and led Stanford with a 1-under 71, fol
lowed by junior Eric Dahlberg's and sophomore
Philip Rowe's 725.
Fhe squad checked in early in preparation for Fri
day's 7:12 a.m. tee time, the first of the day, and all
realized improvement was needed to be in position
to challenge fora berth.
The Cardinal commenced play at the 10th hole in
the second round, and started the morning on the
back nine holes, dubbed by Regional spectators and
participants alike as the easy side of the course.
Day two was highlighted by junior Alex Aragon's
heavy-hitting round of 70. A de
termined Aragon shot eight
strokes better than his previous
day's score, sensing the urgency
of the situation. Brett and Rowe
carded 71s, giving Stanford a
score of 3-under for the day as the
Cardinal remained in I Ith place
with playing partner UCIA at
even par, three strokes behind
Cal and Idaho, the ninth-place
teams. Goodwin's prophecy had
so far rang true, and Stanford re
alized that the final round would
be a dogfight for the last two or
three spots in the NCAAs.
On the eve of Saturday's
round, Goodwin said the team
needed "a five- or six-under to
qualify" and told the players of
the need for "defensive golf on
the sucker pin positions" — those
right on the edge of the green.
"What 1 told them was simple,"
Goodwin said. "If on the range
and the* first few holes their irons
are accurate, go straight for every
pin. If not, then make a decision
to go for the pin or the middle of
the green."
