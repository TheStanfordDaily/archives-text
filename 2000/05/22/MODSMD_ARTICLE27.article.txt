FRESNO â€” The dry, scorching heat of Riverbend
Golf Course on Saturday was the scene of a series of
conclusions for the No. 25 Stanford men's golf team.
The curtains were drawn on retiring head coach
\Vally Goodwin's 40-year career, senior captain
Dusty Brett's time as a Cardinal golfer and the 1999-
2000 team's quest fora berth in the NCAA Champi
onships.
Stanford finished in 10th place at the NCAA West
Regional in Fresno May 18-20, losing in a playoff late
Saturday evening to Cal, just missing qualifying for
the NCAAs.
The three-team tiebreaker consisted of Idaho,
Cal and Stanford, all of whom finished at 1-over on
the tournament. The playoff format sent each play

eight in the top 25, with 10 spots to Opeilka, Ala., the

Thursday Stanford, paired with UCLA and the
University of Pacific, was the last team to tee off,
forced to negotiate Riverbend's afternoon sun and
the rock-hard greens that resulted. The Cardinal fin
ished at three over par, tied for 11th place with Cal
and Oregon State. Junior Jimmy Lee hit 16 greens in
regulation, and led Stanford with a 1-under 71, fol
lowed by junior Eric Dahlberg's and sophomore
Philip Rowe's 725.
Fhe squad checked in early in preparation for Fri
day's 7:12 a.m. tee time, the first of the day, and all
realized improvement was needed to be in position
to challenge fora berth.
The Cardinal commenced play at the 10th hole in
the second round, and started the morning on the
back nine holes, dubbed by Regional spectators and
participants alike as the easy side of the course.
