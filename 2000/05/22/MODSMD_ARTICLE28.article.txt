MALIBI — l op-ranked Stan
lord entered Sunday's NCAA
Championship final with No. 2
Georgia with an unblemished 30-
0 record.
Unfortunately, the Cardinal's
last match was its toughest.
After lour hours of play, Geor
gia (27-2) finally clinched the 5-4
upset with a thrilling 9-8 (7-!?) vic
tory at No. I doubles.
"I've been coaching 25 years
and I can't think of a match that
was more exciting than that," said
Stanford head coach Frank Bren
nan. "Georgia tame today ready
to play, and I have to take my hat
off to them."
Although the Cardinal players
were \ isiblv disappointed after the
loss, they knew they couldn't have
tried harder.
"I'm really proud of this team,"
said freshman star Laura
Granville. "We handled all the
pressure realh well, loday just
wasn't our day."
I lie store was even at 3-all after
singles play.
At the No. I position, Georgia's

Aarthi Venkatesan, ranked fifth
nationally, overcame sophomore
Marissa Irvin in three sets, 6-3, 5-
7.6-3.
Irvin served 19 double faults
during the match. She seemed
discouraged by the loss.
"Marissa's a great champion,"
Brennan said. "She felt very re
sponsible lor her team. But she's
allowed to lose every once in a
while."
While senior Jennifer Heiser
and Granville both won their
matches in straight sets, sopho
more Lauren Kalvaria lost to Bull
dog Marissa Catlin in two tight
sets, 7-5, 7-6.
At Nt). 6 singles, sophomore
Keikt) Tokuda was upset by Geor
gia's Anne Nguyen, 6-3, 1-6, 6-3,
in a grueling baseline duel, leav
ing the Cardinal trailing, 2-3.
But they don't call sophomore
Gabriela Lastra "The Showgirl"
lor nothing. After leading Geor
gia's Lori Grey, 6-2, 5-2, Lastra
suffered a brief collapse, reverting
to defensive tennis and handing
Grey the second set in a tie-break.

Keiko Tokuda, the Cardinal's No. 6 seed, fell to Georgia's Anne Nguyen, 6-
3, 1 -6, 6-3, as the Lady Bulldogs upset Stanford for the national title.
firmly behind her, however, Las
tra swept through the third set, 6-
1.
She then partnered with
kalvaria for an easy 8-2 victory at
No. 3 doubles. Meanwhile, how
ever, Georgia's No. 2 squad of Es
ther Knox and Venkatesan were
carving out an 8-3 win over
Granville and Tokuda.
Thus, the pressure fell upon
Stanford's top squad of Irvin and
Teryn Ashley. Although Ashley
sat out the singles with a sore
back, she played spectacular ten
nis in her doubles match.
Irvin, on the other hand,
seemed out of sorts as Georgia's
Grey and Catlin quickly leapt to a
6-1 lead.
Although the Cardinal dis
played tremendous tenacity to
even the score at 8-all, the Bull
dogs were focused throughout
the tie-breaker.
"What a comeback," Brennan
said. "We had the momentum
going and all we had to do was
break serve. Unfortunately,
Georgia played some wonderful
tennis. But it was a great match."

Stanford's road to the finals
was a smooth one. On Thursday,
the Cardinal crushed No. 14
Northwestern, 5-1, before
sweeping aside No. 8 UCLA, 5-0,
on Friday.
Saturday's semifinal en
counter with fifth-ranked Cali
fornia, however, was a con
tentious one.
Although several of the singles
matches were hotly contested,
Stanford eventually prevailed by
lop-sided score of 5-0.
Hie afternoon's most dramat
ic match took place on Court 1 as
Irvin took on Cal's Anita Kuri
may, ranked 18th in the nation.
A calm and focused Kurimay
quickly jumped to a 5-2 first-set
lead, frustrating Irvin with low
bouncing slices and deft drop
shots.
Irvin found her range, howev
er, and eventually took a 6-5
lead.
Then, without warning, Irvin
self-destructed, serving seven
double faults and losing the set,
7-6 (7-3).
"I thought she played well in
the first set," said Irvin, a Santa
Monica native, "but I kind of
handed it to her. I knew that my
team was depending on me, and
1 was playing at home, in front of
people 1 know."
Irvin displayed tremendous

resilience over the next two sets,
powering past Kurimay, 6-1,6-1.
"Kurimay was a great player
in the first set," said assistant
coach Lele Forood. " This was a
defining match for Irvin. She was
able to find a way to win even
after her serve deserted her."
At No. 2 singles, Granville
cruised past Gal's Amy Jensen, 6-
1,6-3.
"I think the Granville / Jensen
match was one of the best college
matches I've ever seen," Bt en
nan said. "The level of tennis
stayed high through the entire
match.
At the No. 3 position,
Kalvaria won a close match over
Gal's Glaire Gnrran, prevailing,
7-5, 6-1. Hie match was a tense
grunt-fest; both players ques
tioned line calls throughout the
close first set.
"It was a tight match,"
Kalvaria said. "There was a lot of
pressure out there, and I came
out a little nervous, a little shaky."
Tokuda seemed far from ner
vous on court 6, thoroughly out
playing Gal's Jenny Lee fora 6-1,
6-3 victory. Tokuda, who re
placed an injured Ashley in the
Stanford lineup, seemed espe
cially focused during the match,
and Lee soon crumbled beneath
her relentless onslaught.
"I'm verv focused," Tokuda

said. "Sitting on the bench has
helped me so much this year. I've
learned how much 1 love my ten
nis. Playing for my team is the
most unbelievable feeling."
Heiser clinched the win for
the Cardinal, defeating Cal's
Christina Fusano in three sets, (i
-2,5-7,6-1.
"Jen (I leiser) has won a lot of

key matches for us in her four
years," Brennan said, "and this
was one of them. It's tough to
beat a team four times in a row,
and that's what we did with Cal
this season. I have to give the
Bears credit — they fought hard.
But our team is really tough
mentally."
In fact, the Cardinal is tough

in every sense of the word. I lope
fLilly, it'll be tough enough to re
alize that despite yesterday's loss,
it enjoyed a tremendous season.
"We upset Florida to win the
national title last vear," Brennan
said. "So upsets happen. Mavbe
our upset last year inspired Geor
gia this year. But overall, its been
a heck of a season."
