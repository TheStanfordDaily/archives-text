### EMILY DRESSEL STAFF WRITER 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. â€” I he shadows of
shock and dismay that consumed the Stan
ford softball team (45-18) Friday, after being
knocked out of the NCAA Regional Tour
nament, were a far cr\ from the giggly and
elated squeals of joy that erupted from the
same players early last week after discover
ing their team had snagged a No. 1 seed.
With its regular season complete, the
Cardinal headed to Ann Arbor, Mich., with
high hopes of winning the tournament and
a panging hunger to qualifv for the World
Series in ()klahoma Citv the following week,
a feat Stanford has never been able to ac
complish.
And this vear 'hey won't get to accom
plish either.
Friday, the (Cardinal fell 5-4 to No. 2 seed
Michigan (44-15-1) in a gutsy but inade
quate performance that dine lied its elimina
tion from regional plav.
Stanford dropped its first game of the
double-elimination tournament on llmrs
<la\ to (lentral Michigan (.'52-1 I), the No. f>

seed in the regional, who was predicted to
tiill at the Cardinal's cleats and plead for
mercy.
It couldn't have been a more different
story.
I he Chippewas were the ones to break
the ice in the top of the 13th and hold the
Cardinal scoreless in the bottom of the in
ning to win 2-1.
Mustered by the reality of having lost its
first tournament game, the young team
struggled to regroup overnight and focus
ahead on the rest of the weekend.
However, the team that was waiting for
Stanford was the one it had previously ex
pected to meet in the championship game,
Michigan, who had been unexpectedly mer
cied by No. 5 Del'aul the game before.
It was an odd formula, the No. 1 and No.
2 seed in the first loser's bracket match of the
tournament. The situation was do or die.
And somebody had to lose.
After the Wolverines scored one in the
first, Stanford quickly loaded up the bases to
make a come-back but couldn't push a run

Freshman pitcher Dana Sorenson struck out 13 batters on Friday, but a
strong outing couldn't keep the Cardinal from being upset in the NCAA Re
gional in Ann Arbor, Mich.
