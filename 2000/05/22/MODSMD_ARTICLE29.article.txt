### EMILY DRESSEL STAFF WRITER 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. — I he shadows of
shock and dismay that consumed the Stan
ford softball team (45-18) Friday, after being
knocked out of the NCAA Regional Tour
nament, were a far cr\ from the giggly and
elated squeals of joy that erupted from the
same players early last week after discover
ing their team had snagged a No. 1 seed.
With its regular season complete, the
Cardinal headed to Ann Arbor, Mich., with
high hopes of winning the tournament and
a panging hunger to qualifv for the World
Series in ()klahoma Citv the following week,
a feat Stanford has never been able to ac
complish.
And this vear 'hey won't get to accom
plish either.
Friday, the (Cardinal fell 5-4 to No. 2 seed
Michigan (44-15-1) in a gutsy but inade
quate performance that dine lied its elimina
tion from regional plav.
Stanford dropped its first game of the
double-elimination tournament on llmrs
<la\ to (lentral Michigan (.'52-1 I), the No. f>

seed in the regional, who was predicted to
tiill at the Cardinal's cleats and plead for
mercy.
It couldn't have been a more different
story.
I he Chippewas were the ones to break
the ice in the top of the 13th and hold the
Cardinal scoreless in the bottom of the in
ning to win 2-1.
Mustered by the reality of having lost its
first tournament game, the young team
struggled to regroup overnight and focus
ahead on the rest of the weekend.
However, the team that was waiting for
Stanford was the one it had previously ex
pected to meet in the championship game,
Michigan, who had been unexpectedly mer
cied by No. 5 Del'aul the game before.
It was an odd formula, the No. 1 and No.
2 seed in the first loser's bracket match of the
tournament. The situation was do or die.
And somebody had to lose.
After the Wolverines scored one in the
first, Stanford quickly loaded up the bases to
make a come-back but couldn't push a run


JOHANNES BURGE/The Stanford Daily File
Freshman pitcher Dana Sorenson struck out 13 batters on Friday, but a
strong outing couldn't keep the Cardinal from being upset in the NCAA Re
gional in Ann Arbor, Mich.
across before Michigan got the
outs.
I hc real excitement came in
Ihe third when both teams
wound up rallying to score four
runs a piece.
In the top of the inning, Stan
ford appeared to be in a tizzy
with its composure unraveling at
the seams.
Using key hits, a squeeze
bunt play and smart base-run
ning Michigan had the Cardinal

tied up in knots and forced a
pitching change fiom the Stan
ford bench.
Freshman Dana Sorensen,
who had gone the distance pitch
ing 13 innings the game before,
replaced freshman Maureen
LeCocq in the third with one out
on the scoreboard.
But, once the storm had past,
the Stanford women decided to
cause some treacherous weather
of their own.
In the bottom of the inning,
the top of the order strung three
hits in a row, capped off by
sophomore center fielder Jessica
Mendoza's 13th home-run that
clamored into the right field

bleachers after scaling the out
field fence.
An RBI double by freshman
Cassi Brangham near the bot
tom of the order scored another
and all of the sudden, Stanford
was back in the game, trailing 5-
4.
"1 was very proud of the way
we battled back," said head coach
John Rittman. "I think it's an ex
cellent testament to our players
as lots of Other teams would have
folded the tent and given up at
that point."
After the third inning, the
game flew by and the Cardinal
failed to get any sort of offense
going to produce the sole run it

needed to stay alive.
Even Mendoza, with her .478
batting average, the top in the
country, struck out in the bottom
of the seventh, an unusual fate
tor the Par-10 Player of the Year.
Part of that had to do with
Michigan's pitcher, Marissa
Young, who was unwilling to
throw the N'o. batter anything
she could hit after seeing her sail
one out of the park already that
day.
"I made a mistake pitch — the
one she wailed on," said Young.
"She's a great hitter and did what
Stanford needed her to with that
one and I paid for it. 1 wasn't
going to let her do it again

though, so 1 mixed things up a bit
and striking her out in the sev
enth was a huge out for us."
And so the girls return home
this weekend . . . the season com
plete. but, to manvofthe plavers,
complete a week too soon.
"It's a very frustrating feel
ing, said Mendo/a. "The same
thing happened to us last year in
regionals — two and out. It's just
going to be weird. I mean, it's
been go-go-go since January for
us and all of the sudden vou stop
because of this.
"But, this only motivates me
more. I have two more years
here. We're jyoing to do it. We're
going to go."
