# Top choices Lambda Nu, Xanadu
## More men than women in Draw leads to large disparity in cutoff numbers this year 
### JED ROSE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Lambda Nn was the most popular residence choice tor men
in this year's Draw, while Xanadu was the most sought after
residence among women.
Students' top housing choices changed little from last year,
but several surprises awaited students taking part this year in
the decades-old spring lottery system that assigns students
housing lor the follow ing year.
Fluctuations in gender cutoffs for many residences are typ
ical, but this year's Draw showed some major discrepancies.
"This was due entirely to a jump by 90, from 1,977 to 2,067,
ill the number of applications from men â€” in fact the number
of applications from women dropped slightly, from 2,000 to
1,973," said I odd Benson, I lousing Assignment Services man
ager.
"It is difficult to determine why these changes occurred."
