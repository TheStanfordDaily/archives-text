# Top choices Lambda Nu, Xanadu
## More men than women in Draw leads to large disparity in cutoff numbers this year 
### JED ROSE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Lambda Nn was the most popular residence choice tor men
in this year's Draw, while Xanadu was the most sought after
residence among women.
Students' top housing choices changed little from last year,
but several surprises awaited students taking part this year in
the decades-old spring lottery system that assigns students
housing lor the follow ing year.
Fluctuations in gender cutoffs for many residences are typ
ical, but this year's Draw showed some major discrepancies.
"This was due entirely to a jump by 90, from 1,977 to 2,067,
ill the number of applications from men â€” in fact the number
of applications from women dropped slightly, from 2,000 to
1,973," said I odd Benson, I lousing Assignment Services man
ager.
"It is difficult to determine why these changes occurred."

said Benson. "Sometimes the
change goes in different directions
tor men than it does lor women."
An extreme example of such ;i
difference can he seen with the cut
offs of Slavinski Dom, where the
line was drawn at 1,977 lor men,
while women with a draw number
as low as 2,740 gained entrv into
the house.
Benson said that <i total 0f4,042
undergraduates applied this year
for 2000-2001 housing, a slight in
crease from the total of :V77 stu
dents who applied for housing last
year.
Some trends that did continue
for this year includes required pri
ority to get into Suites and I erra.
Both men and women shared the
same top five desired residences,
although in different order.
They were Lambda Nu,
Xanadu, Bob, 680 Loinita and
Granada. I he common residences
in the bottom five pic ks lor men
and women in this year's Draw
were Arroyo, francos and Casa
Zapata.
fhe constant wavering ol Draw
numbers leaves some students
puzzled because there are no
guarantees in housing, even if
your number is well below the cut
off for that dorm last year.
"Adorm w ill g<> low I his year be
cause it went high last year and
people will think ihe\ can get in,"

sophomore Sebastian Davis said.
Freslunan Noelle Moseley, who
was assigned to loyon, said the
Draw's "unpredictability and
Vegas odds base turned jit| into
Stanford's favorite four letter
word."
Cutoffs for assigned housing
dropped even lower this year,
dropping to 2,500 from 2,699.
Students are guaranteed four
years of housing, unassigned stu
dents who are guaranteed are
given housing as space becomes
available at various housing
around campus.
I he cutoff for men was 2,500
and lor women 2,740," reported
Benson.
"I nassigned students who still
have a guaranteed year remaining
will be ollered housing either in
the housing waiting-list round in
Julv oi dining the walk-in round
which begins just belbre the start
ol autumn quarter," he said.
I he administrators in charge of
the I)raw are holdinga meetingon
I hursdav to disc uss and take sug
gestions on improving the cm rent
established system which gives
three preferred years and one tin
preferred year to students.
"We're certainh always inter
ested in seeing if there are ways to
improve the I )raw and will < eriain-
Iv be reviewing this year's Draw to
see if there are any spec ific im
provements that might be made,"
Benson said. "At the moment,
though, we don't have specific
plans to make a particular set of
changes.
