### BRETT KAUFMAN STAFF WRITER 
For the time being, Stanford w ill have to
learn how to share.
After taking the second two games of a
three-game Pacific 10 Conference series
with UCLA, the No. 2 (lardinal (12-1X 17-
7 Pac-10) earned a conference co-champi
onship with the Bruins and No. M Arizona
State.
Stanford's offense burst out this past
weekend against UCIA to tally l"> runs in
the series, surprising even themselves with
an outstanding performance at the plate.
The increased production made up lor
sub-par outings on the hill from the Cardi
nal's three starting pitchers. I lie week

be a part of that."
Stanford's seniors finished
their final regular season with a
17-11 win at Sunken Diamond. A
marathon at three hours, 52 min
utes, the game saw 21 total walks.
Stanford began with nine runs in
its first two innings to cruise to vic
tory, with a seventh-inning grand
slam from Joe Borchard, sealing
the win for the Cardinal.
Though relief pitching strug
gled and provided some room for
the Bruins to battle back, the game
was in little doubt as Stanford led
the entire game.
Saturday's contest highlighted
the Cardinal's big weekend at bat,
as Bruin starting pitcher Rob
Henkel lasted only one-plus in
ning while allowing nine runs.
Stanford scored seven times in
each of the first two innings under
an intense sun, wearing out UCLA
and keeping the Bruins down for
good, 19-3.
I he win on Saturday was a
must-have and kept the Cardinal's
Pac-10 hopes alive after it
dropped the series opener Friday
night.
The first seven batters in the
Stanford lineup reached base and
the team batted around before the
Bruins could even find a second
out. After one and a half hours
and just two innings, junior Justin

Wayne took the mound for his
third inning of work with a 14-1
lead.
After a shaky first inning,
Wayne settled down to collect
eight strikeouts while allowing just
one run and four hits. With his six
innings pitched, he gained his
12th victory of the year, becoming
just the second pitcher in the con
ference this season to do so.
"To drop one to UCLA like that
[on Friday night] is really tough,
and winning today was huge be
cause we gave ourselves a chance
to win the series," Wayne said.
A three-run home run for
Muth in the first inning gave the
Cardinal the lead, and it never
looked back. Muth's 17th homer
of the year gave him the team lead
in that category and tied him for
second all-time in Stanford history
with 56 career home runs.
The night before, in front of a
Sunken Diamond regular-season
record attendance of 4,080,
sophomore Jeff Bruksch's wild
pitch in the top of the ninth inning
broke a 9-9 tie and gave UCLA the
winning run with one out.
The Bruins scored the winning
run without managing a hit in the
ninth. The huge crowd watched
Bruksch walk the bases loaded
after he retired the first batter of
the inning. Then, Bruksch lost
control in his delivery, allowing
Bruin junior Bill Scott to cross the
plate and give UCLA the lead.
Stanford had led 9-5 in the sev
enth, when freshman Ryan Mc-

Call) surrendered three runs in
just a third of an inning. The Bru
ins scored four times in the inning
to knot the game, the first run
coming oflfof starter Jason Young.
" They're not machines," Mar
quess said of his two young reliev
ers. "On the whole, they've done a
really good job for us, but tonight
they just couldn't get it done."
Young was less than stellar in
his no-decision, going six and one
third innings while giving up 10
hits and six runs, all earned. I low
ever, he exited the game with the
lead and stood to win his eighth
game of the season before the late
collapse.
Young said his performance
was "not a good one. We had a big
lead and an opportunity to settle
down and blow the game right
open, hut I wasn't able to do that."
The comeback defeat of Stan
ford on Friday night clinched a
share of the Pac-10 title for UCIA
who would have claimed the con
ference outright with a win either
of the next two days. However,
two wins each by Stanford and Ari
zona State give the Pat-10 a base
ball championship shared by
three of its nine teams.
l he jubilation over a confer
ence title is short-lived, as NCAA
Regional action is just four days
away. Today at 12 p.m., the entire
field of 64 teams in the tourna
ment will be announced live on
ESPN. The team will release game

17-11 victory against the Bruins. The Cardinal took two of three games in the
series to claim a share of the Pacific 10 Conference title.
be a part of that."
Stanford's seniors finished
their final regular season with a
17-11 win at Sunken Diamond. A
marathon at three hours, 52 min
utes, the game saw 21 total walks.
Stanford began with nine runs in
its first two innings to cruise to vic
tory, with a seventh-inning grand
slam from Joe Borchard, sealing
the win for the Cardinal.
Though relief pitching strug
gled and provided some room for
the Bruins to battle back, the game
was in little doubt as Stanford led
the entire game.
Saturday's contest highlighted
the Cardinal's big weekend at bat,
as Bruin starting pitcher Rob
Henkel lasted only one-plus in
ning while allowing nine runs.
Stanford scored seven times in
each of the first two innings under
an intense sun, wearing out UCLA
and keeping the Bruins down for
good, 19-3.
I he win on Saturday was a
must-have and kept the Cardinal's
Pac-10 hopes alive after it
dropped the series opener Friday
night.
The first seven batters in the
Stanford lineup reached base and
the team batted around before the
Bruins could even find a second
out. After one and a half hours
and just two innings, junior Justin

Wayne took the mound for his
third inning of work with a 14-1
lead.
After a shaky first inning,
Wayne settled down to collect
eight strikeouts while allowing just
one run and four hits. With his six
innings pitched, he gained his
12th victory of the year, becoming
just the second pitcher in the con
ference this season to do so.
"To drop one to UCLA like that
[on Friday night] is really tough,
and winning today was huge be
cause we gave ourselves a chance
to win the series," Wayne said.
A three-run home run for
Muth in the first inning gave the
Cardinal the lead, and it never
looked back. Muth's 17th homer
of the year gave him the team lead
in that category and tied him for
second all-time in Stanford history
with 56 career home runs.
The night before, in front of a
Sunken Diamond regular-season
record attendance of 4,080,
sophomore Jeff Bruksch's wild
pitch in the top of the ninth inning
broke a 9-9 tie and gave UCLA the
winning run with one out.
The Bruins scored the winning
run without managing a hit in the
ninth. The huge crowd watched
Bruksch walk the bases loaded
after he retired the first batter of
the inning. Then, Bruksch lost
control in his delivery, allowing
Bruin junior Bill Scott to cross the
plate and give UCLA the lead.
Stanford had led 9-5 in the sev
enth, when freshman Ryan Mc-

Call) surrendered three runs in
just a third of an inning. The Bru
ins scored four times in the inning
to knot the game, the first run
coming oflfof starter Jason Young.
" They're not machines," Mar
quess said of his two young reliev
ers. "On the whole, they've done a
really good job for us, but tonight
they just couldn't get it done."
Young was less than stellar in
his no-decision, going six and one
third innings while giving up 10
hits and six runs, all earned. I low
ever, he exited the game with the
lead and stood to win his eighth
game of the season before the late
collapse.
Young said his performance
was "not a good one. We had a big
lead and an opportunity to settle
down and blow the game right
open, hut I wasn't able to do that."
The comeback defeat of Stan
ford on Friday night clinched a
share of the Pac-10 title for UCIA
who would have claimed the con
ference outright with a win either
of the next two days. However,
two wins each by Stanford and Ari
zona State give the Pat-10 a base
ball championship shared by
three of its nine teams.

ence title is short-lived, as NCAA
