# Women look ahead to individual matches
## 
### BILL HANSON STAFF WRITER 
MALIBU —Although the top
ranked Cardinal women's tennis
team (30-1, 8-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) was upset by No. 2 Georgia
in the finals of the NCAA Team
Championships, Stanford might
still steal a portion of the glory at
this week's NCAA Individual
Championships.
"When you win a national team
championship, sometimes you
don't have any emotion left for the
individuals," said Stanford head
coach Frank Brennan. "So maybe
this loss will work in our favor."
Five Cardinal players qualified
for the elite 64-player field: senior
Teryn Ashley, freshman Laura
Granville and sophomores Lau
ren Kalvaria, Keiko Tokuda and
Marissa Irvin.
Most eyes this week will be on
sophomore star Irvin, the nation's
top-ranked player and the tourna
ment's top seed.
Irvin, who spent last summer
participating in professional tour
naments, returned to campus in
the fall as the world's highest
ranked amateur.
In January, she caused a stir
Down Under, winning three
matches in the qualifying draw of
the Australian Open before falling

to world No. 1 Lindsay Daven
port, 6-4,7-5, in the second round.
Once she finally returned to
collegiate competition, her confi
dence was soaring.
After amassing a perfect 20-0
singles record during the regular
season, however, Irvin suffered a
surprising loss to Fresno State's
Kim Niggemeyer last week.
Although she struggled with
her serve over the weekend, she
still managed to post wins over
UCLA's Sara Walker and Califor
nia's Anita Kurimay. On Sunday,
however, she was upset by Geor
gia's Aarthi Venkatesan, 6-3, 5-7,
6-S.
Spectators will see if Irvin can
regain her championship form
over the course of this week's tour
nament.
Deemed by Brennan as "the
best player in college tennis," Irvin
will look to improve upon her
1999 NCAA tournament run, dur
ing which she reached the final be
fore falling to the University of San
Diego's Zuzana Lesenarova in a
third-set tie-breaker.
This year, Irvin faces a difficult
road to the final. In the second
round, she could face Georgia's
Esther Knox. A possible rematch
with Walker looms in the third
round.
In the quarterfinals, Irvin could

find herself playing teammate
Tokuda, ranked 32nd in the na
tion.
Tokuda, however, would first
have to get past Florida star Whit
ney Laihoand hard-hitting Krish
na Kraszewski of Washington.
Kalvaria enters the tournament
unseeded despite her national
ranking of ninth (the NCAA seeds
players based on criteria other
than the Intercollegiate Tennis As
sociation's national rankings).
As result, Kalvaria faces a tough
first-round opponent in Arizona
State's Allison Bradshaw, the tour
nament's sixth seed.
With a win over Bradshaw,
however, Kalvaria could enjoy a
relatively easy path to the semifi
nals.
"I just want to play some solid,
consistent tennis," Kalvaria said.
"That should get me where I want
to be."
Ashley and Granville will com
pete in the half opposite team
mates Irvin, Tokuda and Kalvaria.
Ashley is a question mark.
After struggling to recover
from tendonitis in her wrist dur
ing the early part of the season,
Ashley's play has been erratic and
inconsistent in recent months.
Her opponents are aware, how
ever, that she is capable of beating
anyone if she gets on a roll.

Currently, Ashley is lighting a
new injury — a still, spasming
back.
Granville, on the other hand, is
finally healthy after sitting out
much of April with torn ligaments
in her l ibcage.
Ranked third in the nation,
Granville has complied a team
leading 41-3 singles record while
playing No. 2 singles for the Car
dinal.
In February, Granville won the
lIA National Indoors, the third
leg of the collegiate grand slam.
Now, she threatens to make a seri
ous dent in this year's NCAA
championship ch aw.
"It's going to be hard to get over
[losing the team championship],"
Granville said. "But I'm playing
well and I'm confident. I'm excit
ed for Individuals."
(Granville's quarter of the draw,
however, is fraught with obstacles.
Lesenarova lurks as a possible
third-round opponent, while USC
star Jewel Peterson could cause
problems in the quarterfinals.
"Laura's playing well," Bren
nan said. "She's definitely a dark
horse to win the tournament.
Marissa Irvin's the favorite to win
the tournament. Maybe it'll come
clown to an all-Stanford final.
That would be a nice consolation
prize."
