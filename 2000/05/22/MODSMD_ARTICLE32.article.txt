# Fate deals a cruel blow to Stanford softball
## 
### 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. — It can be cruel,
ruthless and unpredictable.
The game of softball — a sport that can
take as many twists and turns to make the av
erage spectator diz/y and disoriented.
And postseason is no different, some
times even more unbelievable.
Regional brackets are specifically de
signed to benefit the top-seeded team, giv
ing them the best time slots to play, and the
weakest teams to dispose of in order to wig
gle their way to the 112 inal games.
But sometimes the grand plan just
doesn't work according to expectations.
Sometimes even the opposite hap
pens . . .
Stanford (4f>-18) came into the Michigan
regional pumped and boasting the No. I
seed, determined to finish on top, and qual
ify for Stanford's first ever NCAA Softball
World Series in ()klahoma (lity.
It was a legitimate goal. The Cardinal had
fought hard and improved all season, earn
ing a fourth-place finish in the country's
most competitive conference, the Pacific 10
Conference.
The team had played the best of the best,
traveled all over the U.S. and claimed the
No. 9 rank in the country. 1 his was Stan
ford's year to make its mark.
But when Stanford dropped its first
game of the tournament 2-1 against No. (i

seed Central Michigan (32-11) in an ex
hausting 13-inning duel, disaster threat
ened to strike.
Now in the losers bracket, the Cardinal
prepared to play the loser of No. 2 Michigan
and No. 5 DePaul game and was greeted
with another ironic twist of fate.
DePaul wound up slaughtering Michi
gan in fixe innings, which pinned the two
top seeds against each other in a do-or-die
game that was originally expected to played
out in the ('.hampionship on Sunday.
I he Cardinal couldn't seem to put it all
together and surrendered its season to the
Wolverines, 5-4.
Brimming with emotion, the players left
the field in silence, stunned at the events that
had played out before them and sent tliein
home empty-handed.
With spirits crushed and bruised, they
buried their heads and wondered how this
could have possibly happened.
"Kverybody wauled it so badly," said se
nior catcher Kellie Wiginton, who played
her last collegiate softball game on Friday.
"In fact, I think we may have wanted it too
much, pushed to much, instead of relaxing
and trusting our game. Whatever it was, ii
was not for lack of'effort."
"But no breaks went our way either. We
weren 't playing as well as we could and it cer
tainly helps when you get some calls to fall
your way. On the other hand, we shouldn't

have to hope for or depend on those breaks
to win the game for us."
Head coach John Rittman had some an
swers of his own.
"Wejust didn't play our best soliball this
weekend, and at this level, you have to be on
you're A game. We made a lot of execution
mistakes and neglected to get the timeh hits.
That's what made the difference."
I'he coach is right. In truth, Stanford's of
fense severely lacked this weekend with the
l«ittoiii of the lineup (5-9) going 4-f'or-'57 be
tween the two days.
The only two people who consistently
produced for the (Cardinal were sophomore
shortstop Robin Walker and sophomore
center-fielder Jessica Mendo/a, although
freshman Cassi Brangham did contribute
with some key hits.
Mendo/a was responsible for four of the
five Cardinal runs, with two thunderous
home runs and Walker played a stellar
game on Friday going 3-lbr-4.
But an offense can't function oil two peo
ple's bats, otherwise you scale yourselfdown
to only three innings instead of the lull seven
that you boast even a c hance of scoring.
Pitching was also a hamper for I he (Cardi
nal. Although they had four freshman pitch
ers on the roster it seems in the clutch situa
tions only one can get the job done.
And the problem with Regionals, is that
everything is clutch.

That freshman is Dana Sorenson (22-9),
who stole the show on Thursday, pitching all
1 '5 innings, skating the (Cardinal out of nu
nierous liigh pressure situations and strik
ing out a mind-boggling 15 batters.
Stanford used Sorenson's services again
on Friday, but after the damage was ah ead)
done.
If the Cardinal wants to get anywhere
they need another Sorenson i<> step up.
And so a very disheartened group of 1(5
girls headed back to campus litis weekend
after an abrupt and premature end to theii
season, struggling to restrain the emotion.
" Thisgroup is so incredihU special," that
makes ii even harder, Wigintoti said. "I just
tried to keep a straight face while giving the
other team high fives and saying 'good
game.' All during the game you aren't
thinking about what will come later, it just
all of a sudden hits you afterward. It's this
Hood of sentimentality — that 1 will never
again play on a team with these girls or go
through the line and slap five with t lie other
players."
And .is for the future kellie says, "There
is so much incredible talent on this team,
that they are going to be so good next year.
They are going to bring home a National
(championship for Stanford. I hey will."

center-fielder Jessica Mendo/a, although
freshman Cassi Brangham did contribute
with some key hits.
Mendo/a was responsible for four of the
five Cardinal runs, with two thunderous
home runs and Walker played a stellar
game on Friday going 3-lbr-4.
But an offense can't function oil two peo
ple's bats, otherwise you scale yourselfdown
to only three innings instead of the lull seven
that you boast even a c hance of scoring.
Pitching was also a hamper for I he (Cardi
nal. Although they had four freshman pitch
ers on the roster it seems in the clutch situa
tions only one can get the job done.
And the problem with Regionals, is that
everything is clutch.

That freshman is Dana Sorenson (22-9),
who stole the show on Thursday, pitching all
1 '5 innings, skating the (Cardinal out of nu
nierous liigh pressure situations and strik
ing out a mind-boggling 15 batters.
Stanford used Sorenson's services again
on Friday, but after the damage was ah ead)
done.
If the Cardinal wants to get anywhere
they need another Sorenson i<> step up.
And so a very disheartened group of 1(5
girls headed back to campus litis weekend
after an abrupt and premature end to theii
season, struggling to restrain the emotion.
" Thisgroup is so incredihU special," that
makes ii even harder, Wigintoti said. "I just
tried to keep a straight face while giving the
other team high fives and saying 'good
game.' All during the game you aren't
thinking about what will come later, it just
all of a sudden hits you afterward. It's this
Hood of sentimentality — that 1 will never
again play on a team with these girls or go
through the line and slap five with t lie other
players."
And .is for the future kellie says, "There
is so much incredible talent on this team,
that they are going to be so good next year.
They are going to bring home a National
(championship for Stanford. I hey will."
