I he Stanford Film S<xiet\ sponsored the
festival, which is now in its third year. About
,H5O students attended the opening of the fes
tival.
Film society board member Beth Robi
now it/. ;i senioi. said that she thought that this

cited high attendance, thediversitv and num
ber of' Films, and the (jualitvof the filmmaking
as indicators of the festival's success.
When speaking about the films shown,

Robinowitz said, "We try to have diversity —
ill.it's important. We want to encourage peo
ple i<> try film in different forms." Robinowitz
also directed a film shown al the festival.
I lie filmmakers introduced their own
films and mentioned different challenges and

drugs.
In the film the students said that
drugs were not as popular at Stan
ford as they were at some schools.
Hut the students talked openly
about their experiences with chugs
on-campus, mentioning I n< banted
Broccoli Forest as a hub of drug ac -
tivity. I licy ;ilso criticized the- Stan
ford police and talked about how
Stanford students view marijuana
and alcohol use as more acceptable
than other drugs such as cocaine.
Robinow itz said that she was im
pressed with the overall qualit\ of
filmmaking, adding that she was ex
cited about the number of people
that turned out to see the films. She

said slit* hopes tlutt the films appeal
to a diverse group oi people.
Junior (Jiris (atssen, who co-di
rected and co-wrote with junior
C»regg Wilson the film "Epiphany
Now!," said that making short films
requires a large time commitment
and lots of resources. He estimated
that he and Wilson spent 30 hours
per week working on their film. But
lie said, "Considering what we
gained from the- film, we realized it
was definitely worth it. We learned a
lot."'
Cussen described the filmmak
ing proc ess as "self-run" and said,
"Anyone who is making a film at
Stanford is going against the grain.
There is overall little support for
filmmakers."
Bui the film society works to help
students translate their visions onto
lilm. Students made the films

through two different film pro
grams sponsored by the society.
The Film Grant program gives
Stanford students up to $500 to
make original films and is itself
funded partially by film society's
ASSU Special Fee. Seven of the stu
dent films shown at the festival were
made through the grants.
Hie grant process is becoming
increasingly competitive, according
to Robinowitz. The applications,
which are due early in winter quar
ter, must include a thorough pro
positi and budget.
l he Undergraduate Film Work
shop is the "production wing" of the
SI S. Robinowitz the program was
founded last year in hopes of creat
ing a "cohesive program" that
would teach film society members
about technical aspects of film pro
duction during weekly meetings.

Wilson and Cussen promoted
their film by distributing fortune
c<x)kies with messages inside en
couraging the reader to see their
film at the festival.
While filmmakers worked on in
dividual publicity for their films,
some students felt that the festival
was not publicized well enough
overall, according to freshman
Emily Prince, who attended the
event.
l he length of the films varied
from around five to around 30 min
utes. l he screenings lasted an hour
and a half past the advertised dura
tion.
The crowd filled the seats, aisles
and back doorways of Annenberg at
times during screenings, especially
at the 1 )cginning The crowd thinned
near the end of the night, but did
not disappear.
