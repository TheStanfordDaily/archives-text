Examiner more profitable
than The Chronicle
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — There's an unusual para
dox in San Francisco's newspaper business: The paper
with the smaller circulation, the Examiner, makes more
profit than its larger rival, the Sati Francisco Chronicle.
This awkward financial relationship received an un
usual going-over at a recently concluded trial contesting
Hearst Corp.'s plans to buy the (Chronicle and transfer its
ownership of the Examiner to a company set up by a l< >cal
publisher.
Industry analysts and executives say a 50-50 profit
sharing arrangement, known as a joint operating agree
ment, discouraged substantial investments in either
paper and locked the owners into an uneasy alliance.
"It saved two papers, but weakened them in the
process," said Frank McCulloch, the Examiner's manag
ing editor from 1985 to 1992.
Press swarms around
Kobe Bryant's new fiancee
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AF) — _ A South
ern California high school is buzzing with the news that
one of its own is engaged to Kobe Bryant, the 21 -year-old
Los Angeles Lakers star.
Rumors swirled Friday at Marina I ligli School, where
I V vans and helicopters flocked after Bryant confirmed
he was engaged to marry Vanessa Laine, an 18-year-old
student.
At the modest home in Huntington Beach where the
fiancee lives with her grandparents, her grandfather
sighed heavily as he confirmed the engagement. He also
confirmed the rumor that his granddaughter would now
be homeschooled and that Bryant and Laine would
probably skip the prom in June.
And yes, she is thrilled.
"When yon are young, you are very idealistic," the
elder laine said. "She seems happy."
Talk also centered on the seven-carat ring Bryant re
portedly gave his fiancee.
Seven carats, according to Sandy Fredlund, manager
of an Orange County Zales jewelry store, is the size of a
nickel, maybe even a quarter, and probably cost about
$100,000.'
ACADEMIA
UC-Berkeley holds auction
The items are expensive. 1 'heir donors, famous. But a
peculiar smell may waft among the anxious bidders: Ex
pensive cologne? Cigar smoke?
I'ry rancid athletic socks, or perhaps last night's mi
(rowave dinner. Since May 7, UC-Berkeley has been
holding an auction of 285 items, including sports mem
orabilia and lunches with celebrities. But those with deep
pockets (or merely deep devotion) could have placed
bids in their underwear. The auction has been held on
line only.
The university has sponsored the event to raise
money for athletics scholarships.
"We have 27 intercollegiate sports, and we run a
deficit trying to keep those sports afloat," says Kevin M.
Reneau, the university's associate athletics director for
marketing and communications. "This is one of the cre
ative ways that we thought up to create a revenue
stream."
Mr. Reneau believes Berkeley is the first university to
hold an online auction to raise money for programs. The
auction was orchestrated by the Internet company
Yahoo.
Officials had hoped that the auction would raise
$ 150,000. With one day remaining, Mr. Reneau says the
returns will probably fall slightly short of that goal.
