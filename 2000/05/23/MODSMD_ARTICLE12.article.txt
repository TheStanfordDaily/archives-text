1940
The February 28. 1940 issue of the Daily
featured a "Get ready for Spring" fashion
section. Among many other amusing pieces
is an item headlined "Feet, legs assume new
fashion import."
The mini-article reads: "Now that skirts
are short and getting shorter, legs are once
more in the public eye. Once more the
shape of women's legs becomes important.
Feet first' is the mottto of most authori
ties, all of whom seem to agree that a woman
with si/e 6 feet in size 5 shoes is not only ru
ining the good looks of her feet and legs but
also her general health, and in many cases
her disposition.
Ankles, calves and thighs with a circum
ference greater than that demanded by
beauty can be made smaller through con
st ientous exercise. And knees, says one ex
pert, are considerably better shaped if the
girl forgoes round garters."

The Bottom Line: Were legs ever not in the
public eye?
