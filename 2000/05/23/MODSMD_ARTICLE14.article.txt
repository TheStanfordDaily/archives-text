Yesterday's article on the Draw included a
paragraph indicating that there would be a
meeting held this Thursday to solicit input
on the Draw. I hat meeting was actually
held last Thursday, May 18, and was spon
sored by the ASSU.
()n Friday the Daily published an article en
tit led "Profs win Sloan research grants"
which incorrectly quoted Gigliola Staffilani
as a male. Staflilani, of course, is a woman.
In yesterday's softball article The Daily
misindentified player Deborah Splansky as
Dana Sorenson in the accompanying
photo.
