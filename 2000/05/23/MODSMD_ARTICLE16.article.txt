BKIT YAHOUN, Lebanon (AP) — South
Lebanon was in chaos yesterday after units of an
Israeli-allied militia abandoned their positions and
Shiite Muslim guerrillas and their supporters rushed
m to reclaim villages held by Israeli forces for two
decades. Six civilians were killed in the violence.
Frightened Israeli-allied militiamen surrendered
en masse or sought asylum in Israel as hopes
dimmed for an orderly, peaceful pullout overseen by
the United Nations.
The collapse of a key section of the front line puts
Shiite Muslim guerrillas on Israel's doorstep and
could hasten the withdrawal of the remaining Israeli
troops in the occupied /.one ahead of their self
imposed July 7 deadline.
The rapid developments — eight villages were
reclaimed by guerrillas and sympathizers on yester
day and six on Sunday — drew a warning from
Israel that it could send its troops back into Lebanon
to keep the guerrillas out.
Some units of the 2,500-inember Israeli-backed
South Lebanon Army militia were in disarray and
loyal militiamen were retreating to their villages near
the border to organize new defensive lines.
In Israel, some painted yesterday's events as an
ominous takeover of the area by Hezbollah guerril
las. Israel set up the zone in 1985 to protect its border
region from guerrilla attacks.
In northern Israel, the army beefed up border
defenses and tens of thousands of civilians, fearing
reprisal attacks, hastily gathered up children, food
and schoolbooks as the army ordered them into
underground bomb shelters.
Israel convened its security Cabinet for a late
night session, and Haim Ramon, a Cabinet minister
and confident of Prime Minister Khud Barak, said he
hoped a complete pullout would come "much earli
er" than July 7, enabling the army to engage in a
broader range of reprisals.
"Up until now . . . we could not react as we are
capable of doing, using the full power of the (army),"
he said. " The rules of the game are changing."
Meanwhile, thousands of Lebanese converged on
the reclaimed villages in Lebanon in cars, trucks and
on foot, many waving flags of the Shiite guerrilla
groups Hezbollah and Atnal.
