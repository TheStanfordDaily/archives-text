to overnight hours as a way of minimizing
the chance that partially audible or visible
snippets reach children.

both hailed as a vidon ovei government
censorship and attacked as an abandon
ment of impressionable youngsteis.

into account the needs of viewers who
want this programming and those who tin
not. Both can be accommodated, and
