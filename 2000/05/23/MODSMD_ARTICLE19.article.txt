Perhaps most significant among these

bringing with them a host of experiences as

Especially important among these quali

While no one is to blame for last year's
low numbers of transfers — the Office of
Admissions cannot always predict the num

their offers of admission — hopefully this
year's higher numbers will restore the bal

to the Farm in the fall.
Perhaps the University should even try
to admit more transfers. While this
increase should not come at the expense of
spots available to freshmen, it would be of
great benefit to the community.
