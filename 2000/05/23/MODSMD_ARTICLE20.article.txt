()f (ourse. the world, particularl) the
lessei -developed world, is filled with stories
Ill.it to most of us seem almost surreal. We
see pictures < il that little girl in Sierra I .cone

to the place involved, it seems verv remote
and detached lioin our selves. We feel
si uk k and hot Tor, but we continue Iving in
oui ( alilornia weather, doing our problem
sets .ind thinking thinking thinking. Do we
have .ins connection with these people at
all? Who are thc\ ? And who are we?
It's hard to come to grips with the fact

thai someliines we reall\ can't do anything
about siln.ilions (>1 horror, and perhaps om
in it Mediate rea< tion to thai lad is indeed to
drown ourselves back into onr everydu)
lives. It is ibis reaction — this reaction of liv
ing lile as ( lose to normalcy as possible, dial
everyone the world over tries ver\ hard to
maintain. It keeps oni sanity, and it keeps
om world in one piece. Anything else
would be n in- chaos.
It is not apathy, it is simply a way to
maintain lile. I tan e-mail my embassy and
congress-people, I can join a rally, and I can
form an activist group — I can do all that
.ind more, and I si ill wouldn't be able to
soke even problem, every egregious abuse
of human rights and ever) 1 precarious polit
ical situation out there. And lor iis Stanford
students — and we're a particularly ambi
tions lot il von haven't noticed — that's an
awfnl lac l to have toexplicith deal with. But
at least we ir\; that is the most important
pait. Kven il we're not a member of a
group, each <>1 iis is on the path to s(une
lhing else, and somehow, like a bntterfh
flapping its wings in Roble field and in turn
causing a Inn ricane in lokvo, we will have
an impact positive and negative, whether
we like it or not.
We students are accused main times of
being out of touch with the Real World,
whatcvei that is supposed to be. I've trav
eled to over ,'M) nations and two disputed
territories since I was si\. and I can vouch
fin the I act that there is no real world,
there's just one world and si\ billion people
up to something.
It isoka\ toenjoN the Slip-ancl-Slicleand
laugh heartih while doing it. It is oka\ to
have an existence where the most stressful
thing on your mind is "Mow am 1 ever
going to figure out the variance ol this
bivai iate population distribution?'' It is okay
to have fun and give off the impression that
vou might be "out of touch" — so long as
you are aware of how luc k\ vou are. I'll bet
thai somewhere in Sierra Leone right now,
somewhere in a back lot in Suva, and even
in a village in I litre-a. there are children,
adults and even college students doing the
same thing we are — having or trying to
have a good lime, and inaylx* even laugh
ing, enjoying the good weather just like we
are. In these "hopeless places" as I lie
Kcononiisi seems fond of saying lately, it's
not always dark, and it's not always horror
and griumcss; sometimes the most "out of
touch'' thing we can do is lorgct that very
simple lac t, and to forget that fact is to for
get one of the very essences of humanity.

C,li as is eunentlx thinking ahonl the [net that in
one month he will he huh in Johannesburg and
seeking . I fiienn 7 nnces for the lahor-angmented
Solow model. He'd love to hear from yon at
<inaloiie\{(( leland.
