The human side of the judicial process
This is iht' time of year when many stu
dents are fiiced with great stress as iliev pre
pare for final exams and projects. As I stal
ed in yesterday's Campus Viewpoint ("New
student judicial process another important
(lasper legacy"), main of Our I lonor ('ode
violations come about as a result of students
sometimes making had decisions when
lined with great stress they later regret.
A student who made such a mistake has
courageously related her story to me for
publication so others may learn and benefit
from her painful experience. The story fol
ic >ws:
I've always been a fiiirlv honest person.
As a child. I never stole money from ni\
parents, never lied In bind a friend's back,
never cheated on a test. I still think of
myself as honest, just with one big black
mark in ni\ past.
I lie big black mark occurred tnv fresh
man \ear at Stanford, when I plagiari/cd
on a paper for my writing class. I had fallen
behind in the class, was involved in new and
exciting extra-curricular activities and
found out about the paper the day before it
was due. We were supposed to do research
011 (lie Internet and model some lxx>k
reviews of!'of'the Web. Typing away, I start
ed to get nervous that I wouldn't finish the
paper in lime. I glanced down at one of the
book reviews I had printed out and thought
how much stronger the other authors' writ
ings were compared to mine. I sponta
neously began typing in word for word
what one of the other authors had written.
1 continued copying from a couple of the
other authors' pieces until the paper that I
c alled my own was only half my own work.

I had never done something like that
before, ft didn't seem like a very big deal at
the time. I was wrong.
When I went to go pick my paper up, it.
unlike all the papers of my c lassmates, was
in a manila folder with my name written on
the front. The plagiarism had seemed so
insignificant at the time that it had almost
blurred into the past. I felt guilty, but not
guilty enough to be worried about it. I
opened the envelope to find "Plagiarism is
a serious offense. I have notified the Office
of judicial Allairs" written in my professor's
hanclw riling on the front page of my paper.
I can picture those words now, written in
bright red ink, quickly blurred by my tears.
It was the worst feeling I'd ever had, know
ing that someone I truly respected and
admired had to be the one to make me real
ize w hat 1 had done was terribly wrong. I
instantly recognized that I had inadvertent
l\ hurt niv professor and implied a disre
spect for her work.
I became hysterical; I was at a loss of
what to do. 1 started thinking alxnit what
would happen if I were expelled, how
stupid I had been (o think it wasn't that big
a deal, how I was going to face my parents,
after they had taught me to hold such high
moral standards. 1 didn't know how to han
dle the fact that I had plagiarized; 1 was one
of those kids I looked down upon in high
school for cheating; I had in.idea huge mis
take. I dec ided the least I could clo was to
rew rite the paper. 1 knew that I could never
make up for plagiarizing on that assign
ment, but 1 thought it was only fair for me
to have to work as hard as the rest of the
c lass had to.
I was ashamed to face my professor, my
advisor, my parents, my friends and mostly,

myself . I was no longer proud of my accom
plishments, but rather ashamed and
embarrassed. The Judicial Advisor contact
ed me about meeting with her to discuss the
charge filed against me. It was hard to look
her in the eye, but I told her the truth, how
I copied someone else's paper word lor
word in some paragraphs and that only half
i he paper was mine.
felling a stranger that I had plagiarized
was not an easy thing, but the attitude and
manner of the advisor was encouraging. 1
wanted her to know 1 wasn't that type of
person; this was a first and last time thing.
She was very understanding and calmly
informed me of the different steps of the
judiciary process. I left the meeting feeling
a little stable ab.nit the situation; the
judicial process was, in a strange way, guid
ing me through the coping process.
I was told to write a statement, describ
ing my side of the story, any circumstances
that might be related, etc. It was my chance
to face up to my mistake and really think
about what I had done and what it meant. I
began to understand the severity of my vio
lation.
I received a letter a few days later stating
that the advisor had found the grounds
necessary for continuation of the process; in
other words, we lx>th knew I had plagia
rized. A hearing was going to be scheduled
sometime in the spring or following fall in
which I would have my case heard in front
of a panel of students and faculty, whom
would ultimately decide my sanctions. The
only tiling to do was wait until a hearing slot
opened up.
During this period, I had a difficult time
coping. I knew I had made a terrible mis

take, and the situation hung over my head
day and night. 1 made a conscious effort in
my writing class to show my professor I was
not usually the type of person to cheat and
take the easy way out ol things. ()n my var
ious research papers, I paid particularly
close attention to the details of plagiarizing,
from quoting incorrectly to paraphrasing
out of context.
There were no more hearing slots avail
able in the spring, so I tried, unsuccessfully,
to put the situation out of my mind over the
summer. 1 contemplated transferring
schools, to avoid the embarrassment of hav
ing to face my friends and anyone else who
knew about it. 1 often questioned why I did
it, and could only come up with one answer.
1 had a huge lapse of judgment. There were
so many other things I could have done,
like pull an all-nighter, turn it in late, or
explain to my professor that 1 was just real
ly swamped with work and hadn't had the
chance to finish it.
When I returned in the fell, a hearing

date had been set. I met with the Judicial
Advisor and jlie Judicial Officer again,
going over what each panel member would
receive, how the hearing was going to run,
and when I would find out my sanctions.
They repeated that it was an informal hear
ing many times, and that 1 should not lie
scared, but that 1 may want to bring tissues
in case 1 cried. 1 was allowed to bring one
person in with me lor support, but she
would not be allowed to speak. My advisor
had been helping me cope with the prob
lem since day one, and 1 asked her to
accompany me to the hearing.
During the panel I was embarrassed to
face the panel members, but wanted to ltxjk
them in the eye and show them my sinceri
ty. My professor was there and it made
things a little more difficult, since facing her
was one of the hardest things. A student,
who stated why the case had l>een pursued
thus far as well as the evidence available
against me, led the panel. The professor
gave an explanation of the assignment, and
then 1 was given a chance to say why 1 had
plagiarized and what 1 had learned from it.
My advisor by my side, I managed to strug
gle out a few sentences about regret and
shame. 1 can only hope that the students

and faculty members, who were all very
understanding and nonjudgmental, under
stood what 1 tried to get across that night.
I waited downstairs with my advisor
while the panel discussed my sanctions,
appreciating the chance to discuss some
thing other than my case. About 20 minutes
later, the Judicial Advisor and Judicial ()Hi
cer came down and told us the panel had
made their decision. 1 was to lie suspended
for a quarter and had to complete 40 hours
of community service by the end of spring
quarter. I thanked the panel and left the
room, somehow leaving a part of the shame
behind me.
Standing outside with my advisor 1 felt
the greatest sense of relief 1 had had in a
long time. Though I still had to complete
my sanctions, the worst part was behind me.
I had made a huge mistake, forced myself
to face it and learned from it. 1 now know
that every action I make, no matter how
arbitrary it may seem, reflects what kind of
person I am.
The situation forced me to think about
who I really am and who 1 want to be. I had
always prided myself on my strong sense of
what was right and what was wrong. I know
that my senses of right and wrong did not

change, it was my judgment that did. I still
knew dial what I was doing was wrong, but
for some reason I did it anyway. Through
the judiciary process, I learned to cope with
something I'm incredibly ashamed of Little
by little, step by step, 1 was guided and sup
ported through feelings of shame, regret,
acceptance, and understanding.
The other day I was looking at one of the
little blue books used to write answers in
during exams. I used to sign the bottom
line, stating that 1 "acknowledge and accept
the Honor Code" without much thought; it
was just another line holding me back from
starting my exam. Now I look at it, a little
shamefully, a little proudly, and sign it care
fully. 1 know I'll never violate it again, and
that's coming from an honest girl.
The identity of this student has been
withheld to protect her confidentiality. As
we approach the end of the quarter and
final exams, this student's story teaches all of
us to take a pause to reflect on how we
translate our core values of trust, respect,
honesty and integrity into daily life. Stan
ford wants its students to succeed and thrive
academically. As part of this commitment,
we provide the resources to assist students
in difficult and stressful situations.

Students are encouraged to seek out
advice from faculty, academic advisors,
counselors and resident fellows, among oth
ers, before making a mistake they could
have avoided. Faculty and staff at this insti
tution care about your personal and aca
demic success and want to help.

A student who made such a mistake has
courageously related her story to me for
publication so others may learn and benefit
from her painful experience. The story fol
ic >ws:
I've always been a fiiirlv honest person.
As a child. I never stole money from ni\
parents, never lied In bind a friend's back,
never cheated on a test. I still think of
myself as honest, just with one big black
mark in ni\ past.
I lie big black mark occurred tnv fresh
man \ear at Stanford, when I plagiari/cd
on a paper for my writing class. I had fallen
behind in the class, was involved in new and
exciting extra-curricular activities and
found out about the paper the day before it
was due. We were supposed to do research
011 (lie Internet and model some lxx>k
reviews of!'of'the Web. Typing away, I start
ed to get nervous that I wouldn't finish the
paper in lime. I glanced down at one of the
book reviews I had printed out and thought
how much stronger the other authors' writ
ings were compared to mine. I sponta
neously began typing in word for word
what one of the other authors had written.
1 continued copying from a couple of the
other authors' pieces until the paper that I
c alled my own was only half my own work.

I had never done something like that
before, ft didn't seem like a very big deal at
the time. I was wrong.
When I went to go pick my paper up, it.
unlike all the papers of my c lassmates, was
in a manila folder with my name written on
the front. The plagiarism had seemed so
insignificant at the time that it had almost
blurred into the past. I felt guilty, but not
guilty enough to be worried about it. I
opened the envelope to find "Plagiarism is
a serious offense. I have notified the Office
of judicial Allairs" written in my professor's
hanclw riling on the front page of my paper.
I can picture those words now, written in
bright red ink, quickly blurred by my tears.
It was the worst feeling I'd ever had, know
ing that someone I truly respected and
admired had to be the one to make me real
ize w hat 1 had done was terribly wrong. I
instantly recognized that I had inadvertent
l\ hurt niv professor and implied a disre
spect for her work.
I became hysterical; I was at a loss of
what to do. 1 started thinking alxnit what
would happen if I were expelled, how
stupid I had been (o think it wasn't that big
a deal, how I was going to face my parents,
after they had taught me to hold such high
moral standards. 1 didn't know how to han
dle the fact that I had plagiarized; 1 was one
of those kids I looked down upon in high
school for cheating; I had in.idea huge mis
take. I dec ided the least I could clo was to
rew rite the paper. 1 knew that I could never
make up for plagiarizing on that assign
ment, but 1 thought it was only fair for me
to have to work as hard as the rest of the
c lass had to.
I was ashamed to face my professor, my
advisor, my parents, my friends and mostly,

myself . I was no longer proud of my accom
plishments, but rather ashamed and
embarrassed. The Judicial Advisor contact
ed me about meeting with her to discuss the
charge filed against me. It was hard to look
her in the eye, but I told her the truth, how
I copied someone else's paper word lor
word in some paragraphs and that only half
i he paper was mine.
felling a stranger that I had plagiarized
was not an easy thing, but the attitude and
manner of the advisor was encouraging. 1
wanted her to know 1 wasn't that type of
person; this was a first and last time thing.
She was very understanding and calmly
informed me of the different steps of the
judiciary process. I left the meeting feeling
a little stable ab.nit the situation; the
judicial process was, in a strange way, guid
ing me through the coping process.
I was told to write a statement, describ
ing my side of the story, any circumstances
that might be related, etc. It was my chance
to face up to my mistake and really think
about what I had done and what it meant. I
began to understand the severity of my vio
lation.
I received a letter a few days later stating
that the advisor had found the grounds
necessary for continuation of the process; in
other words, we lx>th knew I had plagia
rized. A hearing was going to be scheduled
sometime in the spring or following fall in
which I would have my case heard in front
of a panel of students and faculty, whom
would ultimately decide my sanctions. The
only tiling to do was wait until a hearing slot
opened up.
During this period, I had a difficult time
coping. I knew I had made a terrible mis

take, and the situation hung over my head
day and night. 1 made a conscious effort in
my writing class to show my professor I was
not usually the type of person to cheat and
take the easy way out ol things. ()n my var
ious research papers, I paid particularly
close attention to the details of plagiarizing,
from quoting incorrectly to paraphrasing
out of context.
There were no more hearing slots avail
able in the spring, so I tried, unsuccessfully,
to put the situation out of my mind over the
summer. 1 contemplated transferring
schools, to avoid the embarrassment of hav
ing to face my friends and anyone else who
knew about it. 1 often questioned why I did
it, and could only come up with one answer.
1 had a huge lapse of judgment. There were
so many other things I could have done,
like pull an all-nighter, turn it in late, or
explain to my professor that 1 was just real
ly swamped with work and hadn't had the
chance to finish it.
When I returned in the fell, a hearing

date had been set. I met with the Judicial
Advisor and jlie Judicial Officer again,
going over what each panel member would
receive, how the hearing was going to run,
and when I would find out my sanctions.
They repeated that it was an informal hear
ing many times, and that 1 should not lie
scared, but that 1 may want to bring tissues
in case 1 cried. 1 was allowed to bring one
person in with me lor support, but she
would not be allowed to speak. My advisor
had been helping me cope with the prob
lem since day one, and 1 asked her to
accompany me to the hearing.
During the panel I was embarrassed to
face the panel members, but wanted to ltxjk
them in the eye and show them my sinceri
ty. My professor was there and it made
things a little more difficult, since facing her
was one of the hardest things. A student,
who stated why the case had l>een pursued
thus far as well as the evidence available
against me, led the panel. The professor
gave an explanation of the assignment, and
then 1 was given a chance to say why 1 had
plagiarized and what 1 had learned from it.
My advisor by my side, I managed to strug
gle out a few sentences about regret and
shame. 1 can only hope that the students

and faculty members, who were all very
understanding and nonjudgmental, under
stood what 1 tried to get across that night.
I waited downstairs with my advisor
while the panel discussed my sanctions,
appreciating the chance to discuss some
thing other than my case. About 20 minutes
later, the Judicial Advisor and Judicial ()Hi
cer came down and told us the panel had
made their decision. 1 was to lie suspended
for a quarter and had to complete 40 hours
of community service by the end of spring
quarter. I thanked the panel and left the
room, somehow leaving a part of the shame
behind me.
Standing outside with my advisor 1 felt
the greatest sense of relief 1 had had in a
long time. Though I still had to complete
my sanctions, the worst part was behind me.
I had made a huge mistake, forced myself
to face it and learned from it. 1 now know
that every action I make, no matter how
arbitrary it may seem, reflects what kind of
person I am.
The situation forced me to think about
who I really am and who 1 want to be. I had
always prided myself on my strong sense of
what was right and what was wrong. I know
that my senses of right and wrong did not

change, it was my judgment that did. I still
knew dial what I was doing was wrong, but
for some reason I did it anyway. Through
the judiciary process, I learned to cope with
something I'm incredibly ashamed of Little
by little, step by step, 1 was guided and sup
ported through feelings of shame, regret,
acceptance, and understanding.
The other day I was looking at one of the
little blue books used to write answers in
during exams. I used to sign the bottom
line, stating that 1 "acknowledge and accept
the Honor Code" without much thought; it
was just another line holding me back from
starting my exam. Now I look at it, a little
shamefully, a little proudly, and sign it care
fully. 1 know I'll never violate it again, and
that's coming from an honest girl.
