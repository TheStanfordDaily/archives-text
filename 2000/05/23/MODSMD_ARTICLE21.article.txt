The human side of the judicial process
This is iht' time of year when many stu
dents are fiiced with great stress as iliev pre
pare for final exams and projects. As I stal
ed in yesterday's Campus Viewpoint ("New
student judicial process another important
(lasper legacy"), main of Our I lonor ('ode
violations come about as a result of students
sometimes making had decisions when
lined with great stress they later regret.
A student who made such a mistake has
courageously related her story to me for
publication so others may learn and benefit
from her painful experience. The story fol
ic >ws:
I've always been a fiiirlv honest person.
As a child. I never stole money from ni\
parents, never lied In bind a friend's back,
never cheated on a test. I still think of
myself as honest, just with one big black
mark in ni\ past.
I lie big black mark occurred tnv fresh
man \ear at Stanford, when I plagiari/cd
on a paper for my writing class. I had fallen
behind in the class, was involved in new and
exciting extra-curricular activities and
found out about the paper the day before it
was due. We were supposed to do research
011 (lie Internet and model some lxx>k
reviews of!'of'the Web. Typing away, I start
ed to get nervous that I wouldn't finish the
paper in lime. I glanced down at one of the
book reviews I had printed out and thought
how much stronger the other authors' writ
ings were compared to mine. I sponta
neously began typing in word for word
what one of the other authors had written.
1 continued copying from a couple of the
other authors' pieces until the paper that I
c alled my own was only half my own work.

I had never done something like that
before, ft didn't seem like a very big deal at
the time. I was wrong.
When I went to go pick my paper up, it.
unlike all the papers of my c lassmates, was
in a manila folder with my name written on
the front. The plagiarism had seemed so
insignificant at the time that it had almost
blurred into the past. I felt guilty, but not
guilty enough to be worried about it. I
opened the envelope to find "Plagiarism is
a serious offense. I have notified the Office
of judicial Allairs" written in my professor's
hanclw riling on the front page of my paper.
I can picture those words now, written in
bright red ink, quickly blurred by my tears.
It was the worst feeling I'd ever had, know
ing that someone I truly respected and
admired had to be the one to make me real
ize w hat 1 had done was terribly wrong. I
instantly recognized that I had inadvertent
l\ hurt niv professor and implied a disre
spect for her work.
I became hysterical; I was at a loss of
what to do. 1 started thinking alxnit what
would happen if I were expelled, how
stupid I had been (o think it wasn't that big
a deal, how I was going to face my parents,
after they had taught me to hold such high
moral standards. 1 didn't know how to han
dle the fact that I had plagiarized; 1 was one
of those kids I looked down upon in high
school for cheating; I had in.idea huge mis
take. I dec ided the least I could clo was to
rew rite the paper. 1 knew that I could never
make up for plagiarizing on that assign
ment, but 1 thought it was only fair for me
to have to work as hard as the rest of the
c lass had to.
I was ashamed to face my professor, my
advisor, my parents, my friends and mostly,

myself . I was no longer proud of my accom
plishments, but rather ashamed and
embarrassed. The Judicial Advisor contact
ed me about meeting with her to discuss the
charge filed against me. It was hard to look
her in the eye, but I told her the truth, how
I copied someone else's paper word lor
word in some paragraphs and that only half
i he paper was mine.
felling a stranger that I had plagiarized
was not an easy thing, but the attitude and
manner of the advisor was encouraging. 1
wanted her to know 1 wasn't that type of
person; this was a first and last time thing.
She was very understanding and calmly
informed me of the different steps of the
judiciary process. I left the meeting feeling
a little stable ab.nit the situation; the
judicial process was, in a strange way, guid
ing me through the coping process.
I was told to write a statement, describ
ing my side of the story, any circumstances
that might be related, etc. It was my chance
to face up to my mistake and really think
about what I had done and what it meant. I
began to understand the severity of my vio
lation.
I received a letter a few days later stating
that the advisor had found the grounds
necessary for continuation of the process; in
other words, we lx>th knew I had plagia
rized. A hearing was going to be scheduled
sometime in the spring or following fall in
which I would have my case heard in front
of a panel of students and faculty, whom
would ultimately decide my sanctions. The
only tiling to do was wait until a hearing slot
opened up.
During this period, I had a difficult time
coping. I knew I had made a terrible mis
