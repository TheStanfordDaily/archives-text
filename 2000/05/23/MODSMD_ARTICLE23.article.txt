### MEGAN KNIZE STAFF WRITER 
Although participation in
women's collide athletic teams is
growing, a new study indicates
that fewer women are now coach
ing women's teams than at any
point in the past 23 years.
According to a May 19 article
in 1 he (;hroni< le ol 1 ligher Kdu
cation, the study found that this
year women represent 45.(i pet -
cent of the toadies of women's
teams in the N( !AA.
Women made ii|) "»«S percent
of coaches in 1978 and 47.4 per
cent in 1998.
I wo retired physical educa
tion professors from Brooklyn
(>llrge of the (iity I niversity of
New York, K. Vivian Acosla and
Linda jean Carpenter, led the
study. I hey have been studying
trends in women's sports since
1977.
I he study suggested that the
percentage of women coaches
tna\ he a fleeted In the fact that
there are more women's teams in
the N('.AA than ever helbre.
I lie study found that NCIAA
menihers have an average ol 8.1 4
women's teams. Diyisiou I schools
have an average of 8.87 women's
teams.
At Stanford, C.hei \ 11 .e\ick, Se
nioi Associate Athletic Director,
said, "We'ye seen a slow decline in
the number of female coaches as
teams have gotten more competi
tive. Hut we have a very strong
commitment toour women's pro
gram.'
Levick added that the Athletic
I)e, »artuieiit actively recruits fe
male coat lies.
" I he cjuality ol coaching has

improved," Levick said, adding
thai the mmibei" <>l females in
coaching positions is a problem
"we need to do something
about."
According to (larpenter, "Ath
let i< s is siu h an intense part of an
athlete's life that when role mod
els appear in context, thev can
have (|iiiie a positive eflecl."
1 he study found that 205
women's teams were added from
1998 to 2000. According to the
article, basketball, vollcvhal), ten
nis, cross-countr\ and soccer
were the five most popular sports
that the colleges oflered.

Another reason lor the decline
may be that more men are coach
ing women's athletic teams.
I he study found that of the
5.M head-coaching jobs created
since 199H, SO percent of those
have been filled by men. I lie
siiid\ also found that women
represent less than two percent
of the coaches on men's teams
this year.
At Stanford, Levick said that il
a man does coach a women's
team, the stall will ( boose a le
male lirst assistant who will be
"gloomed" to be a head coach at
Stanford or somewhere else in

the future.
However, the study did find
that the number of female athlet
ic administrators has nearly dou
bled to 998 from 528 in
W omen represent about !H per
cent of all athletic s administrators
at NCAA institutions. I his figure
is up from 29 percent in 1988.
"[-Stanford leads] the pack in
terms of female administrators,"
Levick said. "We have a ver\ di
verse staff, with all ethnic back
grounds represeiUecl."
I he study includes data from
75 percent of the NCAA's mem
ber institutions.
