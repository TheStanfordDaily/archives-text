200 meters to go. Glynn grabbed
the title in 9:22.11. a NCAA provi
sional qualifying mark.
"I think the race went pretty
slowly," Glynn said. "Conference
races tend to be that way, kind of
slow then fast then slow. My goal

was to kind ofgo with the flow and
cover everyone's moves. I he wa\
the race went, I thought ii was safe
until the last 150 [meters] to pull
ahead."
Freshman lain Sullivan fin
ished third in 9:28.07.
The 10,000-meter run was also
contested on Saturday. With Ari

letes scoring for the C Cardinal. I S( 1

the sprints — was able to pass up
Stanford in team standings.

metric mile, freshman Lauren
Fleshman dueled a pack of fron
trunners, including eventual win

ner Anna Lopaciuch of USC, ()re
gon's Katie Crabb and Arizona
State's Lisa Aguilera in a thrillingly
fast second-place performance.
Fleshman ran 4:21.28, the ninth
best 1,500-meter showing in

sional qualifying time. Sophomore
teammate Colleen Flaherty came
in sixth in 4:31.22.
fhe 5,000 meters showcased
Stanford's depth in distance
events. Though no Cardinal run
nel could c atc h first-place finisher
Mac Donald, Sullivan was hot on
the chase, blazing to 16:29.25 as
the runner-up. Glynn was five sec -
onds behind to capture third
place. However, the Cardinal's
strength was clearly impressed
upon the crowd by the solid show
ing of sophomores Elena Villar
real (16:52.85), Laura Turner
(17:09.26) and Annis (17:13.13)
and senior Mary Huang
(17:29.31).
While the Cardinal may not
have produced many season-bests
at the Pac-10 Championships, it is
likely that the upcoming NCAA
Championship meet will see times
drop dramatically, Stanford will
send fourteen entries to this week
end's championships, which will
be held in Durham, N.( 1.
