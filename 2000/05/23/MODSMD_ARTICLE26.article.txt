Erin the nation. Andersson has de

(Championship, the third leg of the
collegiate (ii and Slam, Andersson
outlasted Kim, 6-3, 3-6, (i-4. Their

pionship match.

No. 1 player in the nation (Morri
son) to No. 2," Kim said. "I expect
another really tough match."
Stanford has only played VCU
twice in school history. The C Cardi
nal has won both matches, the lat
est in 1994.
