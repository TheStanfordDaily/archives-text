\o one thought ii would Ik* easy, bin now \o. 3
Stan fold's Road to ()nialia and the C< (liege World Se
ries looks even more difficult as the entire field <>112 (>-4
teams was announced yesterday afternoon.
1 lie Cardinal (42-13) will host a Regional lor the
tilth straight season, with the three other teams in its
bracket making return trips to Sunken Diamond lor
the postseason.
With Stanford grabbing the top seed in its Region
al, No. 23 Alabama (38-22) files into the second spot.
Rounding out the field are No. 22 Nevada (.37-17)
and unraliked Fresno State (40-19).
"Obvioush we have a ver\ tough field." said head

coach Mark Marquess. I lie selection committee
"must have felt that we weren't strong enough out
west and the\ had to send us Alabama, so we have a
prettv good Regional.
I lie ( Crimson I ide finished in a tie for third place
in the Sot it heastern (Conference t< >nn lament and will
make its sixth consecutive N( CA\ Regional appear
ance. In addition, Alabama was the runner-up in the
1998 Regional at Sunken Diamond.
Fresno Stateand Nevada have also finished second
in Sunken Diamond Regionals, in 1997 and 1999, re
spectiveh . Karlier this season, Stanford took both of
its games against the bulldogs but dropped iis oul\
contest against Nevada.
In addition to a daunting four-team opening
round. Stanford received the eighth national seed in
the entire tournament. Ibis placement is several
notches lower than expected when compared to the
C Cardinal's consistent spot among the top live in all
three major national polls.
I lit* national seed only comes
into play it Stanford should ad
vance to the C lollege World Series.
To do that, it must first win the
double-elimination Regional
round. It would tlien advance to a
best-of-three Super Regional
against the winner of the Min
neapolis Regional, headed by No.
8 Nebraska and Minnesota.
Five of the tournament's eight
national seeds hail from eastern
conferences, including the top
spot in No. 2 South Carolina. The
only two western teams receiving
national seeds are No. 4 Arizona
State and Stanfbrd-at seven and
eight-despite stronger showings in
the polls all season.
The Fast Coast bias observed in
the 2000 field may be motored by
the selection committee's criteria.
Marquess said he believes that the
Ratings Percentage Index (RPI),a
formula used by the selection com
mittee to compare teams national
ly, underrates West Coast teams.
"With the type of schedule we
play, 1 think out R I*l should reflect
that more and it doesn't," said
Marquess, whose Stanford team
played non-conference series
against No. 10 Florida State, No.
16 Texas, and No. 20 Cal State-
Fullerton. "The RIM is still sort of a
mystery to me."
lhe Pacific 10 Conference re
ceived four bids in all, with UCLA
headed to ()klahoma City and No.
13 I SC. travelling to Fullerton. All
four teams from the conference

were awarded No. 1 seeds within
their respective Regional tourna
ments.
While Marquess did admit
some disappointment and contu
sion concerning his Cardinal's
placement in the field, lie said his
team would have had a challeng
ing Road to Omaha no matter
what the selection committee had
decided.
"At the same time, it doesn't
make any difference - you're

going to have to beat good teams
to go on," he said.
I wo games at Sunken Dia
mond will open the Regional on
Friday, with Alabama facing Neva
da at 3 p.m. and Stanford taking
on Fresno State in the 7 p.m.
nightcap. Three games on Satur
day— at 11 a.m., 3 p.m. and 7
p.m. — will precede Sunday's Re
gional Final, with a 1 p.m. game
time and a 5 p.m. start to follow, if
necessary.
