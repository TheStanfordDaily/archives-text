Reservoir 2, a new water stor
age structure designed to hold

eral days.
The new reservoir is located on
Dish Loop Road in the Foothills. It
is currently being disinfec ted be
fore being filled with water, a
process which is expec ted to take
three to four days.
"We'll be done and have it op
erational by the end of the month,"
said Ibm Zigternian, civil infra
structure manager foi facilities
()perations.
The University uses from 1.5
million to 2.5 million gallons of
watei daily. Facilities operations
personnel said that up to a third of
Reservoir 2's capacity may be
tapped for daily needs. I lowever, as
a backup reservoir, it will mainly be
used for emergency purposes.
flic University's main water
supply will continue to be the
I letch Hetch) Yalle\ in the Sierra

I he $5.5 million building pro
ject commenced last spring at a
time when Stanford's land-use
policies, cspecialh those regarding
development in tlie Foothills, faced
intense scrutiny from special inter
est organizations including the
Stanford ()pen Spaces Alliance.
I lie construction of the reser
voir necessitated realignment of
the road and the relocation of
50,000 cubic yards of dirt. Ihe
Foothills also had to be landscaped
and re-contoured to accommodate
the reservoir.
