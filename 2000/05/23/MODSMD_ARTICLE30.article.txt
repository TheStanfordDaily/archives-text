## Hot days bring the risk of heat illness 
### JOANNE WU STAFF WRITER 
With relaxing, balmy summer weather rapidly approaching, the
temptation to bask in the heat becomes irresistible. But while most
people are aware of and protect against the sun's dangerous UV-rays,
fewer people know much about another potentially fatal risk associ
ated with soaking in die sunshine — heatstroke.
Typically, about 175 people in the United States die every year as
a direct result of summer heat. I his is a higher rate of death than from
almost any other natural disaster, including lightning, hurricanes,
tornadoes, floods and earthquakes.
Heatstroke, also known as hyperpyrexia, occurs when the body
becomes unable t< > dissipate heat through perspiration, allowing the
excess heat to damage internal organs. 1 leatstroke happens most 112 re-


quently when combining physical exertion with hot
weather.
As warm-blooded creatures, humans usually main
tain a lairly constant body temperature by varying the
rate and depth of blood circulation. When bl<xxl is
heated above 98.0 degrees, the body dissipates heat by
losing water through the skin and sweat glands and by
panting. Ihe heart pumps more blood, dilating vessels
and circulating the blood closer to the skin's surface to
release the heat into the cooler atmosphere. At the same
time, water diffuses through the skin as sweat, but only
cools the body if the water is removed by evaporation.
This process is hindered when the humidity is high.
When exposed to extreme heat or activity, the lx>dy
may deplete its supply of water and cause a chemical
imbalance in the body, preventing it from returning to
equilibrium. When the body can no longer compen
sate for the fluid and salt lost from sweating, serious
heat disorders can develop. The high fever caused by
heatstroke can permanently damage the brain or other
organs, and can result in death if not treated immedi
ately.
(children, elderly and the obese are most vulnerable
to heat illnesses, but even a person in gtxxf physical con
dition can suffer heatstroke if the warning signs are ig
nored. It is important to recognize the symptoms of
heatstroke and act quickly to alleviate the situation. Un
fortunately, heatstroke can strike very suddenly, so it is
crucial to constantly check the body's condition when
ever exposed to extreme heat.
Heatstroke usually occurs only at temperatures
around 100 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. Early symp
toms can include headaches, nausea, dizziness, fever,
deep breathing, a fast pulse and dry, hot red skin with
an absence of sweating. If exposure to heat continues,
these symptoms can be followed by a dilation of pupils,
shallow breathing and a weak pulse, convulsions,
seizures, confusion, delirium, hallucinations and loss of
consck nisness.
At the sign of heatstroke, emergency medical assis
tance should be contacted immediately. For optimal re
covery, it is crucial to lower the victim's body tempera
ture and to shorten the duration and intensity of expo
sure to heat.
In order to maintain circulation and lower the Ixxly
temperature as quickly as possible, the victim should be
moved to a cooler place, his feet should be elevated to
allow more blood flow to the upper Ixxly, clothing
should be removed and the body should be immersed
in cool water or wrapped in cold, wet sheets. Ice packs,
cold compresses, fanning, and other ways ofaxjling the
body can be used.
If the person refuses water, is vomiting, or experi
ences any changes in consciousness, he should not be
given anything to eat or drink. No medication or alc<*»
hoi rub should Ix? applied.
Certain steps can be taken to make sure that the
symptoms of heat illnesses never arise. One key to pre
venting heatstroke is hydrating the Ixxly with plenty of
liquids, particularly electrolyte solutions such as
(iatorade, which can replace necessary minerals as well
as water. Alcoholic and caffeinated beverages should lie
avoided, since they speed up fluid loss and worsen the
effects of heat in the body. Heavy meals should also be
av< )ided.
Secondly, outdoor activity should be moderated in
the heat, and include frequent rests. To condition the
body for heat, outdoor work should sun t with short pe
riods of exposure, followed by a gradual increase.
Loose-fitting, lightweight clothing that allows evapora
tion of sweat should be worn. Fans and ail -condition
ing can help in cooling the body because of the in
creased air flow, and unventilated areas, such as closed
cars, should be avoided.
If possible, outdoor activities should l>e done at the
cooler times of the day, before 10 a.m. or after 6 p.m. If
any symptoms of heat illness arise, activity should be
stopped immediately.
Some less serious illnesses associated with the high
temperatures of summer include heat cramps, heat ex
haustion, heat syncope and heat rash. Heat cramps are
muscular pains or spasms in the limbs and abdominal
muscles due to heavy exertion, and are caused by loss
of water, salt and potassium from sweating. Often, the
cramps can <x cur afier the activity, when relaxing. Pre
vention methods include consumption of electrolyte
drinks and high-mineral fruits like bananas.
If suffering from heat cramps, a person should get
to a cool plat e, lightly stretch the cramped muscle, and
replenish fluids by drinking a half-glass of coo! water
every 15 minutes.
I leat exhaustion is a more serious illness that occurs
when the body increases the blood flow to the skin to
cool itself , reducing blood flow to vital organs and caus
ing a mild form of slux k. Heat exhaustion, caused by
excessive fluid loss, usually has adequate warning
symptoms that include headaches, muscle cramps,
heavy sweating, loss ofc<x»rdi nation, loss of appetite, in
tense thirst, dilated pupils, nausea, a weak and rapid
pulse, cold and clammy skin, fatigue and dizziness.
Treatment for heat exhaustion is similar to that for
heatstroke, except emergency medical attention is not
always necessary, and the person should be allowed to
slowly drink some fluids.
1 leat syncope isa form of heat exhaustion caused by
standing for an extended period of time in the heat, al
lowing blood to pool in the heat-dilated vessels of the
lower extremities. I he loss of bl<x>d flow to the brain
.md heart may cause unconsciousness, so a person suf
fering from heat syncope should lx- allowed to lie down
flat or with his head slightly down as s<x>n as possible.
Small amounts of sugar water can Ik- administered
when the person revives.
Heat rash forms on the surface of the skin and is
caused by blocked sweat ducts. To treat a heat rash, a
person should shower or wash frequently, dry thor
oughly, and avoid re-exposure to heat.

With relaxing, balmy summer weather rapidly approaching, the
temptation to bask in the heat becomes irresistible. But while most
people are aware of and protect against the sun's dangerous UV-rays,
fewer people know much about another potentially fatal risk associ
ated with soaking in die sunshine — heatstroke.
Typically, about 175 people in the United States die every year as
a direct result of summer heat. I his is a higher rate of death than from
almost any other natural disaster, including lightning, hurricanes,
tornadoes, floods and earthquakes.
Heatstroke, also known as hyperpyrexia, occurs when the body
becomes unable t< > dissipate heat through perspiration, allowing the
excess heat to damage internal organs. 1 leatstroke happens most 112 re-


quently when combining physical exertion with hot
weather.
As warm-blooded creatures, humans usually main
tain a lairly constant body temperature by varying the
rate and depth of blood circulation. When bl<xxl is
heated above 98.0 degrees, the body dissipates heat by
losing water through the skin and sweat glands and by
panting. Ihe heart pumps more blood, dilating vessels
and circulating the blood closer to the skin's surface to
release the heat into the cooler atmosphere. At the same
time, water diffuses through the skin as sweat, but only
cools the body if the water is removed by evaporation.
This process is hindered when the humidity is high.
When exposed to extreme heat or activity, the lx>dy
may deplete its supply of water and cause a chemical
imbalance in the body, preventing it from returning to
equilibrium. When the body can no longer compen
sate for the fluid and salt lost from sweating, serious
heat disorders can develop. The high fever caused by
heatstroke can permanently damage the brain or other
organs, and can result in death if not treated immedi
ately.
(children, elderly and the obese are most vulnerable
to heat illnesses, but even a person in gtxxf physical con
dition can suffer heatstroke if the warning signs are ig
nored. It is important to recognize the symptoms of
heatstroke and act quickly to alleviate the situation. Un
fortunately, heatstroke can strike very suddenly, so it is
crucial to constantly check the body's condition when
ever exposed to extreme heat.
Heatstroke usually occurs only at temperatures
around 100 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. Early symp
toms can include headaches, nausea, dizziness, fever,
deep breathing, a fast pulse and dry, hot red skin with
an absence of sweating. If exposure to heat continues,
these symptoms can be followed by a dilation of pupils,
shallow breathing and a weak pulse, convulsions,
seizures, confusion, delirium, hallucinations and loss of
consck nisness.
At the sign of heatstroke, emergency medical assis
tance should be contacted immediately. For optimal re
covery, it is crucial to lower the victim's body tempera
ture and to shorten the duration and intensity of expo
sure to heat.
In order to maintain circulation and lower the Ixxly
temperature as quickly as possible, the victim should be
moved to a cooler place, his feet should be elevated to
allow more blood flow to the upper Ixxly, clothing
should be removed and the body should be immersed
in cool water or wrapped in cold, wet sheets. Ice packs,
cold compresses, fanning, and other ways ofaxjling the
body can be used.
If the person refuses water, is vomiting, or experi
ences any changes in consciousness, he should not be
given anything to eat or drink. No medication or alc<*»
hoi rub should Ix? applied.
Certain steps can be taken to make sure that the
symptoms of heat illnesses never arise. One key to pre
venting heatstroke is hydrating the Ixxly with plenty of
liquids, particularly electrolyte solutions such as
(iatorade, which can replace necessary minerals as well
as water. Alcoholic and caffeinated beverages should lie
avoided, since they speed up fluid loss and worsen the
effects of heat in the body. Heavy meals should also be
av< )ided.
Secondly, outdoor activity should be moderated in
the heat, and include frequent rests. To condition the
body for heat, outdoor work should sun t with short pe
riods of exposure, followed by a gradual increase.
Loose-fitting, lightweight clothing that allows evapora
tion of sweat should be worn. Fans and ail -condition
ing can help in cooling the body because of the in
creased air flow, and unventilated areas, such as closed
cars, should be avoided.
If possible, outdoor activities should l>e done at the
cooler times of the day, before 10 a.m. or after 6 p.m. If
any symptoms of heat illness arise, activity should be
stopped immediately.
Some less serious illnesses associated with the high
temperatures of summer include heat cramps, heat ex
haustion, heat syncope and heat rash. Heat cramps are
muscular pains or spasms in the limbs and abdominal
muscles due to heavy exertion, and are caused by loss
of water, salt and potassium from sweating. Often, the
cramps can <x cur afier the activity, when relaxing. Pre
vention methods include consumption of electrolyte
drinks and high-mineral fruits like bananas.
If suffering from heat cramps, a person should get
to a cool plat e, lightly stretch the cramped muscle, and
replenish fluids by drinking a half-glass of coo! water
every 15 minutes.
I leat exhaustion is a more serious illness that occurs
when the body increases the blood flow to the skin to
cool itself , reducing blood flow to vital organs and caus
ing a mild form of slux k. Heat exhaustion, caused by
excessive fluid loss, usually has adequate warning
symptoms that include headaches, muscle cramps,
heavy sweating, loss ofc<x»rdi nation, loss of appetite, in
tense thirst, dilated pupils, nausea, a weak and rapid
pulse, cold and clammy skin, fatigue and dizziness.
