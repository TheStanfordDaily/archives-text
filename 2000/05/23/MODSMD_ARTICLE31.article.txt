Kven if you've never flown in an airplane
before, you have t<> admit thai tliev are |>rett\
cool gadgets. Kver wonder, for example, how
a 400-passcnger aircraft can glide above the
ground for hours at a time? And why airline
food is so bad? Or whv airplanes never seem
to rust, despite their constant exposure to
rain, sleet and snow? The answer to the last
question, in a nutshell, is ihat most aircraft are
made of aluminum, a chemical element that
seems to resist corrosion even when exposed
to air and water — good news for travelers.
lint the fait is that pure aluminum reads
so readilv with water that, according to the
laws of chemistrv, the aluminum shell of an
airplane should actuallv dissolve in the rain.
1 hankfullv, this is not the case. When ex
posed to the atmosphere, aluminum actualK
forms a thin Unci known as aluminum oxide
on the metal s surface that serves .is a protec
tive, rust-resistant shield.
l or the longest time, scientists have known
that aluminum oxide does not corrode in

water, but the answer as to exactly why has re
mained elusive. I'ntil now, that is.
For the first time, researchers have shown
that liquid water has a surprisingly potent ef
fect when it comes into contact with the sul
fa* c* of a metal oxide, a finding with industri
al .md environmental implications.
"Water actually changes the structure of
the solid surface," said Gordon Brown, |r.,
the Dorrell William kirbv Professor ol Karth
Sciences.
Along with graduate student Thomas l\
I rainor and collaborators from the Universi
t\ of (Chicago ,md Lawrence Berkeley Nation
al Lab, Brown presented the first atomic-level
model of w hat happens when water and alu
minum oxide meet in the May 12 issue of Sci
ence.
In its normal state, aluminum oxide con
sists of atoms of aluminum and oxygen bond
ed together. But Blown and I rainor discov
ered that when water molecules come into
contact with aluminum oxide, the atoms of
aluminum and oxygen move apart — in some
cases In more than 50 percent compared to
their normal molecular positions.

As a result, when aluminum oxide's outer
layer becomes wet, or hydrated, its structure
shifts just enough to become chemicall\ inert
and thus unable to react rapidly with addi
tional water moleculcs or atmospheric oxy
gen.:
Ill's change in molecular structure is w hy
aluminum oxide metal resists corrosion.
I lie implications I'rom these findings are
far reaching, particularly for the multi-bil
lion-dollar catalysis and semiconductor in
dustl ies, which are concerned with the effects
of atmospheric water on metal oxides used in
chemical catalysts and silicon chips.
But Brown noted that the real driving
force in the research is the important role that
hvdrateel metal oxide surfaces in soils and
sediments plav in removing toxic inelals like
lead, inercui v, chromium, arsenic, and sele
nium from contaminated groundwater.
I nderstanding the molecular structure of
the particle surfaces with which these metals
react is essential in determining how effec
tiveh thev are removed from the environ-
