# What to do with... The Dish The debate continues over Stanford's Foothills
## 
### STEPHANIE COWLES 
When plans lor a 150-foot
radio telescope to be built in I lie
foot hills near Jnnipero Set i a
Boulevard were put forward in
1958, authors of the proposal
commented that "this large, geo
metrical structure, used for im
portant scientific research, would
become widel) known as a Stan
ford University landmark."
In the subsequent 42 years, this
prediction has come to pass. From
any of the surrounding hills, the
big blue metal tower looms huge
on the horizon. However, the

radio telescope's important scien
tific uses have diminished in re
cent decades. Despite the area's
popular nickname ("the Dish "),
lot man), the looming structure is
the least important part of the
scenen . Most people visit the tele
scope for the land it was built on,
a lew hundred acres of rolling
hills with pockets of oak grove.
Despite the I Diversity's effort
to acre Minnodate several varied in
terests with this plan, no one has
made am promises that the man
agement <>l the Dish and the rest
of the Foothills will become less
controversial ;is a result. Dog

owners have already voiced their
resentment of the University's de
cision to ban their pets when ii is
ahead) difficult to find plates to
walk them. Others have ex
pressed skepticism about the sin
cerity ol the I Diversity's conser
vationist overt tires and the extent
to which they are possible as long
as the land is still being used lot
recreational purposes.
Open access days
The University has allowed
public access to the Dish since the
mid-1980s. Its location, between

two roads made famous by the ad
dresses of numerous Silicon Val
ley startups (Sand Mill and Page
Mill) provides an appropriate
metaphor for its value in the lives
of many local residents — as an
oasis in the midst of the exploding
development of' Silicon Valley.
I he popularity of the Dish
among joggers, hikers and dog
owners is evident every weekend,
when the large paved loop along
the hilltops in front of the radio
telescope is crowded with recre
ators. Based on the most recent
statistics — from 1990-1997 —
1800 people visit the Dish each

weekend.
"We can assume [the number
of visitors] lias grown since (lien,"
Andrew doe, Stanford's director
of dommunitv Relations, told the
l)ail\ in a March 28 art it le. As al
wavs, intense use has had conse
quences, some I niversitx officials
say.
Stanford biologists began map
ping unauthorized trails in De
cember of 1998. According to
Earth Systems cotei minal student
(iordon I loltgrieve, who was in
volved in the trail project as an
undergraduate here, "It became
really apparent prettv c|iiickl\

that there were a whole lot of
them."
I here are almost 20 miles of
trails in fact, which is a higher
densitx of trails than in anv re
gional park, bv a factor of two.
" I here s just a crisscross ol trails
all over." said 1 loltgrieve.
In addition to their sheer den
sitx. the unplanned trails are a
problem because I hev cut haphaz
ardl\ through hillsides. If the
paths had been planned, then
measures could have been taken
to maintain the natural structure
and aesthetics of the landscape. As
things stand, the trails, sometimes as
wide as three to five feet, have caused
rapid erosion and large scars on hill
sides where the land has slumped
down the slope. Trails along
creekbeds have rounded and denud
ed the banks, damaging riparian habi
tats and exposing once shaded streams
to the California sun.
Preserving the ecolog\ ol the Dish
has become a particular concern in re
cent years because of nearbv popula
tions of threatened and endangered
species. Ihe small black and white
tiger salamanders are the most famous
example. Between mostly deadly mi
grations across Junipero Sen a Boule
vard to lay eggs in 1 .ake I.agunita, they
spend their summers burrowing into
the hills, staying cool and eating in
sects. There are also populations of
red-legged frogs, listed as threatened
by state and federal agencies.
A new plan for management
The existing open-access policy is a
product of the early 1980s. Before
then, if you wanted to visit the Dish,
you were required to slop oil first at
the Stanford police station to pick up a
pass.
" That's not to say people didn't
jump the fence," remembered Larry
Morton, director of Covernment and
Community Relations. "We were
faced with a dilemma — should we en
force the no access policy through a

considerable investment of resources,
or should we open things up, lay out
some rules, and hope lot voluntary
compliance?"
For the past 15 years, they have
chosen the latter, but now, the admin
istration is rethinking that approach.
"What worked well for a while has
eventually resulted in overuse," Mor
ton said.
On May 2, President Cerhard
Casper announced that Stanford was
ready to unveil a comprehensive new
management policy. The announce
ment was meant to put to rest some of
the speculation over the University's
intentions — there has been some ap
prehension since administrators
began to express concern over the ef
fects ol open public access. Casper
cited rapid environmental degrada
tion and conflicts over parking as the
main impetus for the policy revision.
He explained that although the Uni
versity recognizes the importance of
the Dish as a recreational area, it has
never been the administration's inten
tion to maintain it as a public park.
Therefore, although access to the
main loop for joggers and hikers will
be maintained, from now on, Univer
sity policy will reflect the fact that the
Dish is an ac ademic reserve.
As part of the new management
plan, (lasper deputized the (lenter for
Conservation Biology to assume Stan
fiord's role as a steward of the land.
Under the direction of the CCB, the
University is going to try to reverse the
land conversion that has occurred
over centuries in a three-tiered plan:
first, damaged areas must be stabi
lized, second, native species will be
reintroduced, and third, a long-term

management plan should be devel
oped.
Implementing the plan
Although the I niversit\ has now
made public its intentions, most ofthe
details are still being ironed out. l or
instance, the precise diincnsi<mis of the
Dish are still under negotiation. " I lie
University's statement of several hun
dred ai res is about as precise as the)
can be right now," said C.arol Hoggs,
director of the Center lot Conserva
tion Biology.
According to Hoggs, the area being
considered runs from ()ld I'age Mill to
Alpine Road, and from | unipero Sen a
Boulevard to liighwa\ 280, though
some of that land basalreacb been put
to other uses, and much of it is cur
rently tied up in long-term leases.
Additionally, there is the matter of
enforcement. "There will be adequate
monitoring," Norton promised. I he
Stanford police have alreadv begun
occasional patrols, however, Morton
isn't looking forward to the search fbi
enough qualified stall to do the job
regularly.
Stanford ecologists and biologists
are more enthusiasm about their ex
panded role. 1 lie new mandate opens
up huge new opportunities for re
search into ecosystem restoration and
management. " I here's no real histon
of such work at Stanford, so this is
new," said Hoggs. She predicts that a
lot of literature will come out ofthe
CC.H's attempt to restore the Dish,
from papers In restoration ecologists
to undergraduate theses.
According to Hoggs, there is so
much room for research because

restoring the dish is a huge project.
Hoggs said the extent of degradation
goes bevond a few eroded hillsides; the
monoculture of non-native grasses
that has c rowded out native vegetation
has greatly reduced the diversity of
species at higher trophic levels as well.
()nce the (X '.B hires someone to head
the project, his or her first big chal
lenge will be to figure out what the end
goal is. " If we can do it, what we would
like- to do is get as much native vegeta
tion in there as possible," said Hoggs.
lo sonic extent, those decisions will
be based on what exists on less dis
turbed land of similar exposure and
topography.
Hoggs does have some concrete
ideas in mind. "We should still be able
to do things like increase cover, which
could bring iu ground nesting birds,"
she speculated.
Signs of change
There is hope for a modest revival
of the tiger salamander. Researchers
have been transplanting larvae lo re
search ponds on the Dish side of Ju
nipero Serra Boulevard, for a few sea
sons already, with the hopes that they
will grow up and return to the same
ponds the following year. Last year,
they saw some limited success, and
11 lev are hopeful that this year will
bring more good news.
The University is still feeling pres
sures from varying factions demand
ing dillcTcnt ways of handling the
space.
"Its one of the problems in living in
a place with seven million people,"
said Hoggs. " I be pressures just be
come overw helming."

densitx of trails than in anv re
gional park, bv a factor of two.
" I here s just a crisscross ol trails
all over." said 1 loltgrieve.
In addition to their sheer den
sitx. the unplanned trails are a
problem because I hev cut haphaz
ardl\ through hillsides. If the
paths had been planned, then
measures could have been taken
to maintain the natural structure
and aesthetics of the landscape. As
things stand, the trails, sometimes as
wide as three to five feet, have caused
rapid erosion and large scars on hill
sides where the land has slumped
down the slope. Trails along
creekbeds have rounded and denud
ed the banks, damaging riparian habi
tats and exposing once shaded streams
to the California sun.
Preserving the ecolog\ ol the Dish
has become a particular concern in re
cent years because of nearbv popula
tions of threatened and endangered
species. Ihe small black and white
tiger salamanders are the most famous
example. Between mostly deadly mi
grations across Junipero Sen a Boule
vard to lay eggs in 1 .ake I.agunita, they
spend their summers burrowing into
the hills, staying cool and eating in
sects. There are also populations of
red-legged frogs, listed as threatened
by state and federal agencies.
A new plan for management
The existing open-access policy is a
product of the early 1980s. Before
then, if you wanted to visit the Dish,
you were required to slop oil first at
the Stanford police station to pick up a
pass.
" That's not to say people didn't
jump the fence," remembered Larry
Morton, director of Covernment and
Community Relations. "We were
faced with a dilemma — should we en
force the no access policy through a

considerable investment of resources,
or should we open things up, lay out
some rules, and hope lot voluntary
compliance?"
For the past 15 years, they have
chosen the latter, but now, the admin
istration is rethinking that approach.
"What worked well for a while has
eventually resulted in overuse," Mor
ton said.
On May 2, President Cerhard
Casper announced that Stanford was
ready to unveil a comprehensive new
management policy. The announce
ment was meant to put to rest some of
the speculation over the University's
intentions — there has been some ap
prehension since administrators
began to express concern over the ef
fects ol open public access. Casper
cited rapid environmental degrada
tion and conflicts over parking as the
main impetus for the policy revision.
He explained that although the Uni
versity recognizes the importance of
the Dish as a recreational area, it has
never been the administration's inten
tion to maintain it as a public park.
Therefore, although access to the
main loop for joggers and hikers will
be maintained, from now on, Univer
sity policy will reflect the fact that the
Dish is an ac ademic reserve.
As part of the new management
plan, (lasper deputized the (lenter for
Conservation Biology to assume Stan
fiord's role as a steward of the land.
Under the direction of the CCB, the
University is going to try to reverse the
land conversion that has occurred
over centuries in a three-tiered plan:
first, damaged areas must be stabi
lized, second, native species will be
reintroduced, and third, a long-term

management plan should be devel
oped.
Implementing the plan
Although the I niversit\ has now
made public its intentions, most ofthe
details are still being ironed out. l or
instance, the precise diincnsi<mis of the
Dish are still under negotiation. " I lie
University's statement of several hun
dred ai res is about as precise as the)
can be right now," said C.arol Hoggs,
director of the Center lot Conserva
tion Biology.
According to Hoggs, the area being
considered runs from ()ld I'age Mill to
Alpine Road, and from | unipero Sen a
Boulevard to liighwa\ 280, though
some of that land basalreacb been put
to other uses, and much of it is cur
rently tied up in long-term leases.
Additionally, there is the matter of
enforcement. "There will be adequate
monitoring," Norton promised. I he
Stanford police have alreadv begun
occasional patrols, however, Morton
isn't looking forward to the search fbi
enough qualified stall to do the job
regularly.
Stanford ecologists and biologists
are more enthusiasm about their ex
panded role. 1 lie new mandate opens
up huge new opportunities for re
search into ecosystem restoration and
management. " I here's no real histon
of such work at Stanford, so this is
new," said Hoggs. She predicts that a
lot of literature will come out ofthe
CC.H's attempt to restore the Dish,
from papers In restoration ecologists
to undergraduate theses.
According to Hoggs, there is so
much room for research because

restoring the dish is a huge project.
Hoggs said the extent of degradation
goes bevond a few eroded hillsides; the
monoculture of non-native grasses
that has c rowded out native vegetation
has greatly reduced the diversity of
species at higher trophic levels as well.
()nce the (X '.B hires someone to head
the project, his or her first big chal
lenge will be to figure out what the end
goal is. " If we can do it, what we would
like- to do is get as much native vegeta
tion in there as possible," said Hoggs.
lo sonic extent, those decisions will
be based on what exists on less dis
turbed land of similar exposure and
topography.
Hoggs does have some concrete
ideas in mind. "We should still be able
to do things like increase cover, which
could bring iu ground nesting birds,"
she speculated.
Signs of change
There is hope for a modest revival
of the tiger salamander. Researchers
have been transplanting larvae lo re
search ponds on the Dish side of Ju
nipero Serra Boulevard, for a few sea
sons already, with the hopes that they
will grow up and return to the same
ponds the following year. Last year,
they saw some limited success, and
11 lev are hopeful that this year will
bring more good news.
The University is still feeling pres
sures from varying factions demand
ing dillcTcnt ways of handling the
space.
"Its one of the problems in living in
a place with seven million people,"
said Hoggs. " I be pressures just be
come overw helming."
When plans lor a 150-foot
radio telescope to be built in I lie
foot hills near Jnnipero Set i a
Boulevard were put forward in
1958, authors of the proposal
commented that "this large, geo
metrical structure, used for im
portant scientific research, would
become widel) known as a Stan
ford University landmark."
In the subsequent 42 years, this
prediction has come to pass. From
any of the surrounding hills, the
big blue metal tower looms huge
on the horizon. However, the

radio telescope's important scien
tific uses have diminished in re
cent decades. Despite the area's
popular nickname ("the Dish "),
lot man), the looming structure is
the least important part of the
scenen . Most people visit the tele
scope for the land it was built on,
a lew hundred acres of rolling
hills with pockets of oak grove.
Despite the I Diversity's effort
to acre Minnodate several varied in
terests with this plan, no one has
made am promises that the man
agement <>l the Dish and the rest
of the Foothills will become less
controversial ;is a result. Dog

owners have already voiced their
resentment of the University's de
cision to ban their pets when ii is
ahead) difficult to find plates to
walk them. Others have ex
pressed skepticism about the sin
cerity ol the I Diversity's conser
vationist overt tires and the extent
to which they are possible as long
as the land is still being used lot
recreational purposes.
Open access days
The University has allowed
public access to the Dish since the
mid-1980s. Its location, between

two roads made famous by the ad
dresses of numerous Silicon Val
ley startups (Sand Mill and Page
Mill) provides an appropriate
metaphor for its value in the lives
of many local residents — as an
oasis in the midst of the exploding
development of' Silicon Valley.
I he popularity of the Dish
among joggers, hikers and dog
owners is evident every weekend,
when the large paved loop along
the hilltops in front of the radio
telescope is crowded with recre
ators. Based on the most recent
statistics — from 1990-1997 —
1800 people visit the Dish each

weekend.
"We can assume [the number
of visitors] lias grown since (lien,"
Andrew doe, Stanford's director
of dommunitv Relations, told the
l)ail\ in a March 28 art it le. As al
wavs, intense use has had conse
quences, some I niversitx officials
say.
Stanford biologists began map
ping unauthorized trails in De
cember of 1998. According to
Earth Systems cotei minal student
(iordon I loltgrieve, who was in
volved in the trail project as an
undergraduate here, "It became
really apparent prettv c|iiickl\

that there were a whole lot of
them."
