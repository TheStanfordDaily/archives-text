# What to do with... The Dish The debate continues over Stanford's Foothills
## 
### STEPHANIE COWLES 
When plans lor a 150-foot
radio telescope to be built in I lie
foot hills near Jnnipero Set i a
Boulevard were put forward in
1958, authors of the proposal
commented that "this large, geo
metrical structure, used for im
portant scientific research, would
become widel) known as a Stan
ford University landmark."
In the subsequent 42 years, this
prediction has come to pass. From
any of the surrounding hills, the
big blue metal tower looms huge
on the horizon. However, the

radio telescope's important scien
tific uses have diminished in re
cent decades. Despite the area's
popular nickname ("the Dish "),
lot man), the looming structure is
the least important part of the
scenen . Most people visit the tele
scope for the land it was built on,
a lew hundred acres of rolling
hills with pockets of oak grove.
Despite the I Diversity's effort
to acre Minnodate several varied in
terests with this plan, no one has
made am promises that the man
agement <>l the Dish and the rest
of the Foothills will become less
controversial ;is a result. Dog

owners have already voiced their
resentment of the University's de
cision to ban their pets when ii is
ahead) difficult to find plates to
walk them. Others have ex
pressed skepticism about the sin
cerity ol the I Diversity's conser
vationist overt tires and the extent
to which they are possible as long
as the land is still being used lot
recreational purposes.
Open access days
The University has allowed
public access to the Dish since the
mid-1980s. Its location, between

two roads made famous by the ad
dresses of numerous Silicon Val
ley startups (Sand Mill and Page
Mill) provides an appropriate
metaphor for its value in the lives
of many local residents — as an
oasis in the midst of the exploding
development of' Silicon Valley.
I he popularity of the Dish
among joggers, hikers and dog
owners is evident every weekend,
when the large paved loop along
the hilltops in front of the radio
telescope is crowded with recre
ators. Based on the most recent
statistics — from 1990-1997 —
1800 people visit the Dish each

weekend.
"We can assume [the number
of visitors] lias grown since (lien,"
Andrew doe, Stanford's director
of dommunitv Relations, told the
l)ail\ in a March 28 art it le. As al
wavs, intense use has had conse
quences, some I niversitx officials
say.
Stanford biologists began map
ping unauthorized trails in De
cember of 1998. According to
Earth Systems cotei minal student
(iordon I loltgrieve, who was in
volved in the trail project as an
undergraduate here, "It became
really apparent prettv c|iiickl\

that there were a whole lot of
them."
I here are almost 20 miles of
trails in fact, which is a higher
densitx of trails than in anv re
gional park, bv a factor of two.
" I here s just a crisscross ol trails
all over." said 1 loltgrieve.
In addition to their sheer den
sitx. the unplanned trails are a
problem because I hev cut haphaz
ardl\ through hillsides. If the
paths had been planned, then
measures could have been taken
to maintain the natural structure
