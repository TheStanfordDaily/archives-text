# Doc Woo pushes author to explore 'Quantum Universes'
## 
### WENHSIN LEE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Being a non-science major and an
idealist in modes of thought, I hardl\
ever use logic to make my decisions. As
much as I learn about the biological
basis for human Ixrhavioror the'if-then'
clauses of physical science, I'd rather
not buy it. Life seems more sponta
neous. mysterious if I don't follow a
course, buy into the reasoning that
everything we experience has a logic al
basis.
I'he other day I'm ('altrain-ing with
Dr. Woo up to San Francisco, and being
the intelligent scientist that heis.hetries
to engage me in a debate alxnit quan

tum universes. At first 1 was clueless, lost
What does "Sliding Doors," a
(iwyneth Paltrow movie where her
( harat ter experiences two separate life
paths based on whether she catches a
subway or not, have to do with science.'
I he idea of <|uanlum universes. Dr.
Woo explains, exerts that every possi
bility, even life path that could possibh
exist, does exist — in another quantum
universe.
Now 1 was starting to get interested.
So where are these universes? The idea
seems completely unrealistic and more
related to fantasy than logic.
But the concept that somewhere out
in 'Quantum I niverse I .and' all the
possibilities resulting from my numer
ous c hoices and decisions and missed
moments exists — that intrigues me.
And knowing somewhere out there.



A CalTrain conversafion with Doc Woo expanded
the author's ideas about "Sliding Doors, country
music, and the children's story "City Mouse ana
the Country Mouse."
I could be living my life without you, without
the meaning that comes from ail my mistakes
and experiences; it makes me wonder how I
thrive, what I live for in that world.
I live my life with the philosophy that every
thing happens for a reason, that we can never
make the wrong choice because we always
have the opportunity to learn ti om our choic
es, and that our self-directed opportunities
lead iis to where we need t< > be. I rite ancl < >ver
ly optimistic ? Questionable at best? I suppose
I see no other way to live and be happy with my
decisions.
Dr. \\ oo tells me we c an't access our quan
tum universes. We can only either subscribe to
the theory that they exist or call the idea a use
less manifestation of looney physicists. The
quantum universe theory can be compared to
the lyrics of a counti) music song or the chil
dren's story "City Mouse and Country Mouse."
Many of my favorite country songs discuss
choices; choices like leaving your hometown,
your high school sweetheart, your front porch
with the swing and mama's corn on the cob
and biscuits with gravy, for-the promise of'hap
piness in the big city.
No matter what though, the hero or hero
ine of the song always realizes that nothing
beats home, and that true happiness is to be
reaped from the comforts of first love, catching
fireflies in the dark, simple pleasures.
So at this point I know you're thinking —
bad analogy. Horrible analogy. But wait, give
my humble explanation of quantum univers
es a chance. In the story "City Mouse and
Country Mouse," the two friends visit each
other's homes, with each first thinking that his
friend's home is better than his own.

lii tlit* end, tlic moral of the stoiy is that
each wants to Ix- in his own 'home sweet
home.' We can compare that simple story to
quantum universes. Kven it 1 had the chance
to explore all the other avenues of my life's
course, 1 have a sense that I'd eventually come
back to the quantum universe where my life
exist now. Why? 1 don't know; it's like know
ing the piece of a puzzle fits before actually
putting it in place. Too complicated? It's like
your momma's love (however psychotic she is,
she's your momma and you wouldn't trade
her for the world).
So what am I trying to say? That even it
quantum universes exist, they're useless? Basi
cally. To me it's like t < >smetic surgery or portals
into other people's lives (aka "Being John
Malkovich"). If the human pursuit is always
going to he in search of an ideal, there are infi
nite steps in our minds to reach that ideal.
If we had access to quantum universes, dis
appointed millions would want to access the
perfect lilt* path. And you may say, yes, but
they may only want to make that one critical
change — getting up the nerve to ask that one
girl out, dumping the jerk who broke your
heart —but one change leads to another to an
other to another, until they're playing hot
potato with their quantum universes.
I .ike cosmetic surgery — first the nose, then
thestomach, the boobs, the eye lifts, when does
it end? And the movie analog) ? Yon start out
wanting to be John Malkovic hand I guaran
tee yon, one clay you'll wake up and want tobe
a bunny. (|ust a feeling.)
So there, that's my non-science argument
against quantum universes. II you disagree
call me up and we'll chat. Just don't bash m\
(ountrv music analogy.
