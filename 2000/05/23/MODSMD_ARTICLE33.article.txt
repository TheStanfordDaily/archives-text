Being a non-science major and an
idealist in modes of thought, I hardl\
ever use logic to make my decisions. As
much as I learn about the biological
basis for human Ixrhavioror the'if-then'
clauses of physical science, I'd rather
not buy it. Life seems more sponta
neous. mysterious if I don't follow a
course, buy into the reasoning that
everything we experience has a logic al
basis.
I'he other day I'm ('altrain-ing with
Dr. Woo up to San Francisco, and being
the intelligent scientist that heis.hetries
to engage me in a debate alxnit quan

tum universes. At first 1 was clueless, lost
What does "Sliding Doors," a
(iwyneth Paltrow movie where her
( harat ter experiences two separate life
paths based on whether she catches a
subway or not, have to do with science.'

Woo explains, exerts that every possi
bility, even life path that could possibh
exist, does exist — in another quantum
universe.
Now 1 was starting to get interested.
So where are these universes? The idea
seems completely unrealistic and more
related to fantasy than logic.
But the concept that somewhere out
in 'Quantum I niverse I .and' all the
possibilities resulting from my numer
ous c hoices and decisions and missed
moments exists — that intrigues me.
And knowing somewhere out there.



A CalTrain conversafion with Doc Woo expanded
the author's ideas about "Sliding Doors, country
music, and the children's story "City Mouse ana
the Country Mouse."
