I lie interface ol Modo is simple and
easy to use. You are introduced to sev
eral different characters, each with dif
ferent interests and conceptions of a
good time. Alter identifying which
character matches you the best, you
find out what that character would he
doing on that particular weekend
evening. II your interests are varied,
however, you might find out what club
Sandy would go to for dancing but
check out classical music lover Hill's
pick for a nice restaurant.
The information is surprisingly
complete foi a task with such a large
scope, and the search tool is highlx or
ganized. Searching for movies, for ex
ample, gives you choices — first run,
c lassic s, etc. 1 lie n, say you get a list of
new movies, and click on "The Ciladia

iu San I rancisco, how to get to those
theaters using public transportation,
gives you cross streets and oilers a re
view ol the movie itself.
One thing the company has in com
mon with other startups is that it relies

on advertising foi c ash How. Across the
bottom of the sin.ill Modo screen, an
advertising banner beckons. A special
button allows you to view a liill-si/e ver

targeting ol advertising to customers
depending on their entertainment
preferences.
