### CHRISTOPHER LYLE RAVI SARIN CONTRIBUTING WRITERS 
We told a friend that we were going
to interview a "VC" tor this article. I le
looked confused and asked, "Why are
you intei viesving a Viet ( ong for an ar
ticle on startups"?
Ihe world lias < hanged dramatical
ly since the 1970s when VC meant the
enemies in the Vietnam War. Recently,
VC has more communis come to mean
venture capitalist.
Behind the scenes of just about
every startup in the Valles is the VC.
I lies provide the lnones and connec
tions to help fledgling companies get
iheir feet on the ground, fhe world of
VCs, howescr, remains a mvsterv to
many in this decade.
We talked to Wai ren Packard, a V('
at a sei \ successful firm. Draper 112 isher
Jurvetson, to trs to denisstifs the in
clustrs and the people behind it.
Packard's roots are strong in Stan
fiord. fie started out in 1985 pursuing
mechanical engineering, and ended
staying six sears for his cotenninal de
gree in mechanical engineering.
Packard was planning on getting his
doc torate, but his girlfriend was admit
ted to medical school in Illinois and he
decided to follow, fhere, Packard
worked for a fortune 500 medical de
sices company for four years.
In 1995, Packard svas ready for a
change. His girlfriend (In then his
wife) was accepted lor resiclencs at
Stanford. Packard had also applied to
t he Cradualc School of Business incase
they ended up hack in Palo Alto.

"I was getting trust rated as an engi
neer,' Packard said. "All the business
men were making the decisions — I
wanted to be part of that. I hat was
when I decided to go to business
schot )1.
During his first year at the CSB,
Packard started a company, Angara K-
Comnierce Services, with his under
graduate freshman dorminate who
was completing his doctorate in engi
neering at Stanford.
I hat summer, Packard got his fust
taste ofthe venture capital w< >rld when
working at Institutional Venture Part
ners. He continued to work part-time
for Angara, which was develc>ping into
a full-time business.
When he graduated the next vear,
Packard was laced with a decision to
enter the venture wot Id or go full-time
with Angara.
At this point, Packard received aca 11
from his Stanford budd\. Sieve Jul vet
son. fhe two had met at Stanford in
1989 as stall at Branner Hall. Packard
was a resident assistant, and Jurvetson
was a residential computer consultant.
1 he two had also bonded plaving I Iti
mate l tisbee, a hobb\ that Packard
com in ties to pursue even n< >sv.
" I he venture induslrv was gi eat tor
me because I don't have a whole lot of
foe us,'' Packard said. " fhe business is a
mile wide and an inch deep."
As a venture capitalist, Packard lus
been vers successful. 1)1 | provided
much of the eai Is c apital and support
for Internet-based companies in the
mid-19905, binding companies such as
Hotmail and Kana. Packard entered
the firm just as the Internet was begin

ning to take oil 'commercially. Since he
has been with DKJ, he has individuall)
sponsored about a dozen companies.
"()nce we fund a company, one of us
works closel) with it to help it grow,"
Packard said. "We don't just give them
money, we also help with tbi tiling part
nerships, recruiting, networking, find
ing an initial market and bringing in
customers. (Mien, we will take a seat on
the Board [ol Directors] also.'
Packard said lie spends about 75
percent of his time working with the
companies that base already been
funded In DKJ. I lie rest of the time, he
works on finding new companies to in
\est in. woi king toexpand DF|, talking
to the press, and giving his lime to var
ious organizations.
Since Packard joined D - J, he has re
tained strong connections with Stan
ford. lie serves as a mentor for stu
dents in the Ma\ lielcl lellc >ws Program
each year, lie also gives his time and
suppoi I to Stanford's Business Associa
tion for Stanford Kngineering Stu
dents.
"Stanford was really important in
m\ life, file connections I made there
base helped me get w here I am tocla\."
Packard said.
Packard did not alwavs, however,
want to be involved in venture capital.
As an undergraduate, he expec ted lie
would alwa\ s be an engineer.
"I reinember working 011 an Kf>()
problem set with |err\ Vang |the co
lounder of Yahoo! |." Packard saic l. "It
was on taxes, and we were talking
about how we wouldn't ever need to
know that smill because we would al
