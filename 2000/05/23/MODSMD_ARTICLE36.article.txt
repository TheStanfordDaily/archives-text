# Shifting a Silicon Valley paradigm
## FOCAL POINT 
### ALEX TUNG EDITORIAL STAFF 
In my font vearsat Stanford I have strug
gled to reconcile a number of conflicting
portions of niv identity, and I have found
that being in Silicon Valley, the heart of engi
neering, hasn't helped much.
Let's start with some quantized personal
definitions. I am an electrical engineer (and
I'm nerclv enough to use a word like "quan
tized.") 1 am an editor ol the science and tech
nology sec tion ol I he Daily. I am ('.liinese. I
have laded blue hair. I drink orange juice. 1
am an Kagle Scout. I participate in coininu
-1 lit\ service. I enjo\ writing fiction and poet
is. I care about the people around me.
Separatcl). I can think about each of these
aspects and gain some conception of what
that part ol mv life lias meant to mv overall
grow th. I lie difficult tiling is to be able to syn
thesize these definitions and filter them into
some manageable doc nine Ibi w here mv life
w ill go next.
Kilter Silicon Valley. Despite all its short
comings, I admit that f<>l'someone in m\ field
ol study, ibis is iVe optimal location. We arc
in the hotbed ol the biggest and most pro
found innovations in technology of anv
where in the world. Yes, I realize that every
one wlic> goes to Stanford knows this. It can't
be avoided realh. You can't go to class with
out someone w hipping out a Palm Pilot to
pla\ the latest suped-up version of I'ctris.
You can't even go into Palo Alto lor a relax
ing meal without hearing a c ell phone l ing to
the obnoxiously butchered tuneol'Kitr Klise
(I urn the damn things oil, people! It's clow 11-
riglit rude!).
Still. I don't think people realize how 11 ul\
special the Valley is. We are saturated In
technology here in a way that no other place
011 earth is, and that is both exciting and un
nerving. Strangely enough, I, as a non-pro
totypical Stanford engineer, feel more in
clined toward the latter view point. Mavbethe
Valley just moves too quickh lor me. ()i
rather, 1 navbe it moves tooquickl\ in what I
see as the wrong direction.
W hen I vocalize this sentiment, however,
tlu-1 espouse is almost alwavs the same. As an
electrical engineer in this environment, I
should feel naturallv at home. I should be ex
cited that I c an go out and join some compa
ny and make tons ol 11101 lev. I should be mo
tivated to new heights ol entrepreneurship
by the mv riacl tv pes of startups spi inging up
all over the place. Don't I want to be a part ol
that e\c iteinent? Don't I want to get in 011 the
ground llooi and be able to toast to some
thing special? Don't I want to pom mv heart
and soul into the newest thing, the latest en
terprise, the one company that's going to be
dillerent liolll all the rest?
Well, quite frankly, I'm not so sure that I
do. Kvervone is familial with the stereoiv ped
"dark side-' ol Silicon Yallev â€” money hun
gry graduates rushing out to grab hold ol the
biggest oiler with the best company, the one
that will surely be the next Yahoo! or at least
have them < ruisin' around in the Z.\\ ol tlicii
c Ik>ice within the first veai.
lo .111 extent, there is validity in tli.it

choice. As much as we waul to believe that
money is not an issue in life, sometimes it has
to be, especially if you want to live an\ where
near I'alo Alto. (ollege is expensive, and the
need to pay off those loans or make some
thing of one's education in monetary reward
often must outweigh one's more socially ( ou
st ions motivations. < )r at least that's the cur
rent mindset.
My objections to the startup craze do not
stem wholly from issues of greed 01 "selling
out." I hey stem from what 1 see as a funda
mental flaw in this cultural mindset.
Kinbedded deep in that perspective lies
the concept that monetary success and social
conscience are mutually exclusive. I've heard
the following line a lot this vear: "Oh. I'm
going to 'sell out for a couple <>l vears aftei
college to pay oil m\ loans and then go save
the world."
i would contend that people can indeed
find well-paving jobs that do not contradict
their ethical aspirations. In fact, I would sa\
that it is one's dillv as an educ atecl indi\ idual
to do exactly that.
lechnology is one of the most powerful
tools we have at our disposal. Ii lias the po
tential to link people all over the world, to
cure disease and save lives and to generalh
improve the c]ua!it\ of life. It can be the best
and m<>st eflet ti\e agent of social c lumge that
we as a societs have ever had.
In the realm of current technology, liow
evci . there is little thought given to these is
sues. I here are few (if any) tec Ii companies
right now w hose goals include direc tl\ help

doesn't inakean) sense if you want voui busi
ness to survive. But there are other wa\s in
w 1 lie Ii companies can reach out to the com
munities around them while making the big
profits, and this is the- ke\ to shilling the ethi
cal paradigm in which we now exist.
M\ favorite example of 11 lis practice is an
organization known as ihe l.ntrepreneur's
Foundation. Ihe foundation helps voting
companies insiill the concept <>l coinmuniiy

compan\ culture b\ setting up toinniunit\
service programs fin their employees. In
stead of stiif 1-bnilcling trips to go w hilewatei
rafting oi rock-climbing, employees can
spend a Saturday together building a house

tract emplou'cs who want to know tli.it their
employer is cognizant of the needs of the
communis around tlieni. and the einplox
ees have a greater sense <>112 fulfillment in

As an engineer, going to work lor ibis
foundation would piohabh not be the best
use ol the skills I've learned here, but work
ing for the companies with whith the foun
dation pai inei s is a viable option. I un as ihe
eternal (\ nit . I find some comfort in the fat t
that 11 ioi e are t>rgani/ati(nis w<>i king toward
this end, and this knowledge li;is helped me
come a step dosei to figuring out in\ own
goals and aspiiations.
