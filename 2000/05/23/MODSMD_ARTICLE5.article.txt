signed by bench numbers rather than
room numbers, with few intervening
walls to impede interactions among
researchers. Labs will share common
areas such as lunchrooms and office
space, as weli as working space such as
cold rooms.
"The very fundamental concept of
the building is that various lab groups
share lab support spaces. It's a major
new idea, said k\le (llenn, senior pro

management, who has worked on the
building since 1996.
