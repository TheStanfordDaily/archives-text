lose one ol its strongest proponents of di
vei sitv when Sails Dickson, director of cam
pus relations, leaves for a position at Duke
I Jniversity on June 30.
As director of campus relations since
1097, Dickson oversees five offices: the Of
fice for Multicultural Development, the Sex
ual I farassment Policy < )ffice, the Work Life

I ielp (-enter.
From IOSB to 1095, she was associate

Dickson's work at Stanford has mainly in
voked diversity efforts in the recruitment
and hiring of I'Diversity staff . At Duke, she
will work with faculty recruitment and liir

ing as the vice president for institutional eq
uity.
While the Office for Multicultural Devel
opment lias been in existence for 20 years,
Dickson explained it gained a new mission
during her tenure.
She said that the biggest challenge she
faced at Stanford, and one that the I niver
sity will continue to face after she is gone, has
been developing Stanford's "ability to re
cruit and hire women and people of color,
particularly in senior-level positions.
Over the past five years, the number of
female faculty menibei s has increased by 81,
an increase of 33.f> percent.
Between Sept. 1998 and Sept. 1999, 47
women were added to the faculty, increas
ing the proportion of faculty who are
women from 18.9 percent to 19.8 percent.
"When I came in, [University President]
Gerhard Casper had commissioned a group
of faculty and administrators to study the
fbcusof this office. One of the recommenda

tions was that the office should re foeus its at
tention on affirmative ac tion for non-acade
mic staff ," she said.
President Gerhard Gasper said in a press
release, "As an institution, we will miss bet
thoughtful guidance and enthusiastic lead
ership. As an individual, I will miss her col
legia! counsel and her warm friendship. I
w isli her all the best as she takes on the chal
lenges and opportunities afforded by her
new position at Duke."
While at Stanford, Dickson said her most
important accomplishments have been "in
form) ing | the managers and cleans of the af
firmative ac tion goals of this I Diversity, and
creating a collegia! partnership with [the ()f
-ficeof] Human Resources."
She also said that major progress had
been made for persons with disabilities at
Stanford. "In terms of our work with the
Americans with Disabilities Act, [it] has been
strengthened in a way that 1 don't think has
evei existed before.

"That doesn't mean that there isn't more
work to do in terms of'diversity and affirma
tive action," she said.
Dickson also mentioned Ihursday's up
coming Multicultural Spring Fest, which is
put on by all of the staff groups and man
aged In her office. She described the event
as a "celebration of the diversity at Stan
ford." While onl\ 500 people attended the
first year, 2,500 people are expected to at
tend on I hursday.
During her four \ ears as a resident fellow
at Lagunita West and three years at Ujaniaa,
Dickson said she developed close bonds with
students. She cited as her "most significant
experience" the pr<kess of creating a class to
explore the history of race riots in Los An
geles. The idea lot the ( lass was sparked by
the 1..A. riots in 1994 following the Rodney
King case.
"Students were very upset and confused
