In the May 24, 1927 issue, The Daily re
ports that the Palo Alto Post Office took over
Stanford mail and the "present condition
may be improved on, hints town office."
" 'Contrary to the idea that some stu
dents have, this will have no effect on cam
pus mail service,' stated C. I. Cook, assistant
postmaster at Palo Alto yesterday. Cook said
no definite plans have been made yet, but it
is possible that improvements would be
made in the present service. One of these
would be the installation of carrier routes.
The change would mean the discontinu
ance of the 1-cent drop rate on the campus
and the charging of 2 cents for all campus
mail....
Cook declared that the plan had been
considered for some time, due to the fact
that all University mail is received at Palo
Alto, and a large part of campus mail is ad
dressed to Palo Alto, as many people are un
aware that Stanford has its own post office^"
The Bottom Line: The Post Office has always
been known for its "improving" service.
