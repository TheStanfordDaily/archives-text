Bob Baffert has the problem of
how to beat Fusaichi Pegasus in the
Preakness all figured out. The train
er.; with an opinion on nearly every
thing, has a few bright ideas on how
to outfox the Kentucky Derby winner
in Saturday's $1 million Preakness
Stakes.
•Load him in the starting gate
backwards.
•Give everyone else a head start.
•Force him to break from behind
the starting gate.
•Call in the Stanford band.
