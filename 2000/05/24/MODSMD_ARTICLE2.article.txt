the Departments ol Biological Sci

new research building.
"This is a wonderful thing for
Stanford, for c hemisti v and for bi

will make a world of 'difference to
us and to the schools. We're all re

building will be built on Roth Way.

Building. Officials predict that ii
will open in September 2002.
Changes in fire codes have
made the current laboratories in
Heron and Mudd unsuitable for
research, according to Brauman.
"Basically, the facilities in Mudd

Malcolm Beaslcv, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences ina press release.
A year ago, Beaslex addressed
the great need loi a new building
at a meeting <>l the school's adviso
r\ council. According to Beasley,
Lokey became interested in the
project .ind started a series ol con
versations with Beasle\ and I ni

"I was reall\ tout lied b\ w hal
he did," said Beaslev. "You cannot
have a great university without
chemist r\ and biology. fhev'vc
got to be strong. Making tlieni
strong requires modern facilities
and enough spate to do the re
search."
I he building w ill help address
some ol the long-term needs of the
Departments of ( lieniisii \ and Bi
ological Sciences.
According to Beasley, space
considerations have also hindered
the Biological Sciences Depart
ments abilil\ to make lac ult\ ap
pointments.
Lokey said he made the dona
tion because he feels the money
w ill Ik* well-spent.
"If someone hadn't come
through with a major gift, this pro
ject would have been delayed
longer-and the standing of the
Chemistry and Biology Depart
ments is at stake," Lokey said in a
press release.
I'he 8 5,000-square-foot
building is currently being de
signed and will probably be
three stories. It will include new
laboratories, laboratory support,

chemical stores and offices.
About two-thirds of the building
will be used by the Chemistry
Department and one-third by
Biological Sciences.
The new building will require
the demolition of the Chem Stores
modular building and the Organ
ic Chemistry Building. The func
tions now in the Organic Chem
istry Building will move into vacat
ed space in Mudd.
Among all of Lokey's gifts to
Stanford, this is his largest. His
gifts include funding for profes
sorships in Human Biology and
Jewish Studies and visiting profes
sorships in Human Biology and
professional journalism.
