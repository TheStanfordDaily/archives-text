## The 						Stanford Daily Housing services must stress room inspection forms 
### 
Published Since IS 1 )I

Tl IK I 1 DINGS ()F the end of the
year are here: boxes littering
dorm hallways, last runs to Sale
way and Costco, and a series of
threatening e-mails from facilities managers
across campus.
At the end of each year, students are
reminded dozens of times to "return your
bed to the lowest possible setting" and
"make sure to remove any stray marks
from the walls." But what many people
may not realize is that failure to comply
with these "suggestions" can result in heavy
fines. Fvery year, students are caught off
guard b)' fines in excess of $50 for what
thev thought were just harmless marks on
the wall.

Facilities justifies their charges by claiming
that students are fined only to cover the
labor and materials needed to fix the prob
lem. They also state that students are never
charged for damage done by previous resi
dents; as long as you lill out the room
i nsped ion form at the beginning of the year,
there's no problem.
But when this form comes buried in a
slack ol other paperwork required at the
beginning ol the year, it comes as no surprise
that many students don't even remember
seeing the form, much less filling it out. lew
lollow-up measures are taken until the end
of the year rolls around and students are
abruptly reminded (usually by a fine) that
the form was never received.

There are many simple things that could
be clone to ensure that the room inspection
forms are filled out and returned, but there
seems to be little interest in carrying these
measures out. The form could be placed on
the Web to make filling it out and returning
it a little easier, or boxes could be placed in
each hallway to accept completed forms. At
the very least, walking past a box labeled
"Room Inspection Forms" would jog <i few
memories.
Another question that many students
have pertaining to these end of the year
fines is, "Why so much?" (.ranted, labor can
often be costly, especially il it must be
employed specifically to fix a single problem,
but even without labor, replacement costs of

furniture is often ridiculously high.
For example, after two of the four lights
in the Francos dorm were pulled down fol
lowing a party this year, the dorm was
accessed a replacement fine of $5,000 for
the lights. And considering the lights came
clown when streamers were pulled off of
them, that $5,000 certainly doesn't seem to
insure quality of installation or durability.
While we all like living in clean and well
maintained residences, it seems that there
are better ways to insure that setting with
out assessing inordinate fines to students.
Surely, one of the easiest first steps would
be to make all students more aware of the
importance of filling out room inspection
forms.
