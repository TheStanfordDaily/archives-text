## My hero Lars, enemy of evil

Lai si Irit h. Defender of capital
isill. Keeper of free enterprise.
I feel so much better now that I
know tli.it Lars I Irich, drum
mer for Metallita, is battling that evil
corporate j4i.nn known as Napster.com,
(hereby keeping the yonih of 0111 nation
safe from any commie. socialist agendas
like "sharing" music.

Internet services
like Napster.coni alb>w
pradicallv anyone to
find and transfer
potential!) illegal Ml' 3
sound files ofprat lical
lv any song ever
recorded. And since
Napstei doesn't pro
\ ide a way to enforce
payment for these

songs, "sharing" music electronically, as
Lars would have yon believe, lakes
mone\ away from hard-working bands
sikh as Metallic a.
II onl\ I had known. I, 100, was
seduced In pcei pressure into the world
ol M I'Ms. 11 started oil small. I was able to
iind rare 01 out-of-print songs. I was able
to hear new releases belore ihey hit big
on the radio. 1 was able to <|iiu kh judge
il 1 wanted to I>ii\ a new album or not.
Little did I know how lar I had fallen.
Hut I wasn't alone. All ol iu\ friends
had MIMs. Some had entire hard drives
devoted to theii nealh catalogued music
tiles. Some even digili/ed (!l)s they
alrcaclv owned because ilicv actualb pre
ferred the Ml'.'t formal, now able lo have
duplicates ol their music collection al
home or al school. Yes. Lars, tlicv were
able* to listen lo music ihe\ purchased
wherever /hex pleased!
So when Lars strode into the San
Mat.eo headquarters ol Napster.com i<>
pose lor his photo-op, 1 cheered as he
brought with him H boxes worth of user
Ilk. each representing one ol those per
nicious hoodlums who'd been illegalh
11 iicling Metallic a music.
I had no idea the problem was so epi
demic. According lo a recent poll,
percent of all college students polled use
Napster at least once a month.
Wow. I doubt even Jamba |uicc can
claim those numbers.
Hut in order to better understand
Metallic as fervent interest in protecting
today's youngsters from the communist
influence of Napster, I've taken the liber
ty of analyzing the lyrics to one of their
more enduring songs: "Kilter Sandman."
"Say your prayers little one/Don't for
get. my son/To include everyone."
Obviously, Lars and Company are
urging religion and tolerance.
" luck you in, warm within/Keep
vou free from sin/Till the sandman

he comes."
Again, (lie lulling warmth of security
keeps us "free from sin" while only the
evil "sandman" comes. Ihe repetitive
syntax of "sandman he comes" only rein
forces this dangerous image.
"Sleep with one eve open/(Gripping
your pillow light."
I lie figure of the "sandman" is dis
lurbing. At least disturbing enough to
"grip youi pillow." Ah, the svmbolism.
Mctallica's exhortation to "sleep with
one eye open" is a plea lor us all to
remain vigilant against the "sandman."
And win feai the "sandman?" because
the "sandman" brings communist, anti
frecdom ideas to our voting ones.
"Lxit: light/Kilter: night/lake my
hand/We're off to never never land."
Somewhat cryptic, I lake this
exchange to mean that after the"day"
is gone and "night" is upon us, Lars
and the rest of Metallita will save us b\
leading us to Michael Jackson's ranch.
Again, not a clear explication, but .it
least it show s Metallic as fervent interest
in sa\ ing the children of Our generation
from the evils of the "sandman" or
Napster.
I mean, look at the parallels. Sand
man has seven letters; Napster has seven
letters. Sandman contains two vowels
and live consonants, inc hiding an Sand
an N; Napster contains two vowels and
live consonants, including an Sand an
N. Need 1 go on?
But lesi I get too carried away with
the genius that is Metallita, I should
mention that Lars is not alone. Dr. Die
recently filed a multi-million dollai suit
against Napster. Vale, Indiana I niversi
tv and I SC. have all banned or severely
restricted Napster use over their net
works.
Now, some might argue that artists
benefit from Napster by introducing
music to people unwilling t<> buy
unknown albums in this age of SI 7 (IDs.
And some might say that adding to a
musician's fan base is preferable to the
royalty from one single's sale in ibis age
of one-hit wonders. And others might
snicker at the fact that monolithic record
companies have more to do with an
artist's bank account than millions ol
Napster users could.
But Lars Illicit will continue to be
my hero, once again making the world
safe from the evils of the Internet. If
only we could convince him to lead the
battle against ICQ.
