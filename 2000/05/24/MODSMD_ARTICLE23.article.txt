Dear President (lasper,
As you know, the janitors who clean
our offices, classrooms and public liuili
ties are now negotiating a new contract
with their employer, American Building
Maintenance. I lie c urrent contract
expires on May .'I I.
Most of the janitors now make $8.04 an
hour, whereas a single adult and a c hild
need at least $12.42 an hour to make ends
meet. Many of the janitors work two or
three jobs and share apartments to make
ends meet in our high-priced Silicon Val
ley area. I he company is proposing a
w age increase of only $ 1 .(>() over the life of
a five-year contract, lower rates for new
hires in smaller buildings and a copay
nient of up to $71 a month for health
insurance. Because of this inadequate
offer, negotiations with the janitors'
union, Service Kniployecs International
Union Local 1877, are bogged down.
We know that Stanford is not the jani

tors' direct einplover. But we believe thai
ilie University should take responsibility
to ensure that all of those whose work
makes our academic mission possible
receive wages and benefits that enable
them to afford decent housing, food and
health care. Therefore, we are asking you
to speak out and lend Stanford's voice to
the janitors' efforts to win a fair contract.
The recent experience of janitors in
Los Angeles has shown that community
support can be effective in helping jani
tors win a contract that will allow them to
live with dignity. Vice President A1 (iore,
Senators Diane Feinstein and led
Kennedy, Cardinal Mahoney, the mayor
of Los Angeles and the largest office
space owner in the city all lent their sup
port to tlu- Los Angeles janitors in their
recent strike. Stanford will be in good
company if we express support fora fair
contract for the janitors who work here,
and this would set an excellent example
lor our neighbors in Silicon Valley.
