### ANITHA REDDY EDITORIAL STAFF 
Dr. Clifford Uyeda, a former
president of the Japanese Ameri
can Citizens League and now one
of its most ardent critics, roundly
denounced the league last night
for its inability to recognize the in
ternment of Japanese-Americans
during World War II as an injus
tice unworthy of accomodation.
Nikkei, the Japanese-American
students' association, sponsored
Dr. Lyeda's speech. The talk is
part of Nikkei's campaign against
the quotation proposed for the
monument to honor the sacrifices
of Japanese-Americans, as veter
ans and internment camp prison
ers, during World War 11.
I he controversial quote is an
excerpt from Michael Masaoka's
"Japanese American Creed."
Coterminal student Steven Yoda,
Nikkei's historian, characterized
the creed as a "blindly patriotic
oath" that did not acknowledge
Japanese-American civil rights.
"Although some individuals
may discriminate against me, I
shall never become bitter or lose
faith, for I know that such persons
are not representative of the ma
jority of the American peo pie,"
Yoda read from the creed.
Uyeda focused on the institu
tional history of the Japanese
American Citizens League, which
did not oppose internment but
rather viewed it as the ultimate
test of loyalty fora Japanese-
American. An independent inves
tigation of the organization's activ
ities during World War II re
