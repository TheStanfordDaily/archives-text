## Troxell riding toward Sydney 
### MEGHAN O'CONNOR STAFF WRITER 
At Stanford it seems like every
one has a bicycle. Some use them to
get to classes, others to explore the
f(M)thills — medical student Megan
'IVoxell is using hers to try to get to
the Olympic Games.
An accomplished cyclist in a vari

vying for one of just three slots in
track racing— her specialty. At the
Olympic Track I rials two weeks

impressive first and second place
finishes respectively in the two and

but also going fast."
While balancing the pressures
and work of medical school, where
she is earning both an MD and
Ph.D., IVoxell has not been able to

prove invaluable in her quest for an
Olympic appearance.
After finishing third in the pur

summer, IVoxell went to Berlin to
compete in the World Champi
