## Troxell riding toward Sydney 
### MEGHAN O'CONNOR STAFF WRITER 
At Stanford it seems like every
one has a bicycle. Some use them to
get to classes, others to explore the
f(M)thills — medical student Megan
'IVoxell is using hers to try to get to
the Olympic Games.
An accomplished cyclist in a vari
ety of events, Troxell is currently
vying for one of just three slots in
track racing— her specialty. At the
Olympic Track I rials two weeks
ago near Dallas, Troxell pulled out
impressive first and second place
finishes respectively in the two and
three kilometer pursuit races, sport
ing a strong 3:47 time on the out
door track.
But because the team is chosen
by the National Team coaches, not
strictly by times or places, the finish
es did in )t automatically grant Trox
ell a ticket to Sydney but rather one
to Mexico City where she will com
pete in a World Cup on June 1().
There the coaches will l>e watching
to see how Troxell competes in in
ternational competition so that they
can decide on the Olympic team
members by July 7.
"1 don't know how she rode as
fast as she did in trials," said coach
Art Walker, referring to the limited
time she had to practice on the track

and an illness that setback her train
ing. "Megan's chances of making
the [Olympic] team hinge on what
she does at Mexico City. It's only
going to happen if Megan really
proves herself, not just placing high
but also going fast."
While balancing the pressures
and work of medical school, where
she is earning both an MD and
Ph.D., IVoxell has not been able to
accumulate the impressive interna
tional resumes of some of her com
petitors, but she is not without in
ternational experience that may
prove invaluable in her quest for an
Olympic appearance.
After finishing third in the pur
suit event at the L'.S Nationals last
summer, IVoxell went to Berlin to
compete in the World Champi
onships, where I Voxell was pleased
with her new low time, 3:40.
"It was a very new experience,"
IVoxell said. "It was exciting to look

at people who've raced internation
ally and see how you stand up under
the pressure of going abroad and
having a good race. But I still have a
lot less international experience
than most."
Where Troxell doesn't lack is col
legiate experience. An avid biker
growing up and ati iathlete at Uni
versity of Virginia, it wasn't until
Troxell came to the Farm and
began riding with Stanford in 1994
that she got into bicycle racing.
"I always enjoyed tiding, but I
wouldn't have started racing il it
hadn't been for the team at Stan
lord. The guys on the team almost
broke my arm twisting it so hard to
get me into track rat ing."
Troxell had an immediate im
pact, helping secure the women's
collegiate championship in the team
time trial event in 1994 and 1995
and the toad race team champi
onship in 1995 and 199f>.
Individually she is equally well
decorated, with six national cham
pionships in the past live years. In
her last two seasons, the All-Ameri
can has reigned as queen oft he pur
suit and omnium — best all-around
on the track. I his past vear, Troxell
was also named Visa I SA cycling
collegiate w<nnan of the year.
Once called " I lie Metronome,"
I roxell's acute internal locus is one
of the qualities that Walker attribut
es to her succ ess.
"She has a very highK developed
sense of cadence with the speed .it
which the pedals are turning."
Walker said. "It's easier for her to
t ideal a constant speed than lot oth
ers, which is extremely impoi taut in
pursuit racing and is probably one
of the reasons she's so got xl."
Along with her consistent speed,
another thing that hasn't budged
has been I roxell's commitment to
the Stanford squad. Despite a three
year hiatus in Indianapolis, from
July of 1995 to January 1995, while
working on her l'lil) project, Trox
ell loyally came back t< > race It >t Stan
ford in the conference champi

unships and nationals.
And even as she rode her way to
l he top, I Voxel I has never forgotten
lhe team that gave her the love of
racing. Alter racing all week at the
Olympic I rack Trials, Troxell
hopped on .t flight to southern (lal
ifbrnia arriving 45 minutes before
Stanford's conference champi
onship, where she cleaned up with
first place finishes in the criterium,
road race and time trial.
"Kven when she has other big
irons on the fire, she has not ne
glected collegiate racing," Walker
said. "While collegiate hike rac ing is
not the highest form in the I .S., the
National Championships have
helped her In giving her familiaritv
with that scope of competition. But
tlicv haveitnpcjseclon her training."
Racing fin Stanford, training lor
the ()lympics, throw in stud) ingcell

biology and you've got a virtually
impossible combination, but Trox
ell manages to juggle it all.
"Everyone at Stanford has been
very supportive in letting me In
flexible," she said. Through travel
conflicts with mandatory rotations,
112 roxell has squeezed it all in to a
schedule that has little- time to spare.
But il I roxell receives ;i spot on the
Olympic team, she savs graduation
w ill just have to wait.
A spot on the Olympic Team
would join Iroxell with Stanford
alumna Nicole I rcedman '94, who
also qualified in the road race event.
"The ()lympics have been some
thing that 's only occurred to me re
ally recenth so I haven't built it up
or trained for years and years,"
I roxell said. "Kvervone wants to do
it and represent their country, but
it's almost hard to imagine."

Megan Troxell is shooting to represent the U.S. in the Olympic Games this
September, while simultaneously pursuing an MD/Ph.D. from Stanford.
At Stanford it seems like every
one has a bicycle. Some use them to
get to classes, others to explore the
f(M)thills — medical student Megan
'IVoxell is using hers to try to get to
the Olympic Games.
An accomplished cyclist in a vari
ety of events, Troxell is currently
vying for one of just three slots in
track racing— her specialty. At the
Olympic Track I rials two weeks
ago near Dallas, Troxell pulled out
impressive first and second place
finishes respectively in the two and
three kilometer pursuit races, sport
ing a strong 3:47 time on the out
door track.
But because the team is chosen
by the National Team coaches, not
strictly by times or places, the finish
es did in )t automatically grant Trox
ell a ticket to Sydney but rather one
to Mexico City where she will com
pete in a World Cup on June 1().
There the coaches will l>e watching
to see how Troxell competes in in
ternational competition so that they
can decide on the Olympic team
members by July 7.
"1 don't know how she rode as
fast as she did in trials," said coach
Art Walker, referring to the limited
time she had to practice on the track

and an illness that setback her train
ing. "Megan's chances of making
the [Olympic] team hinge on what
she does at Mexico City. It's only
going to happen if Megan really
proves herself, not just placing high
but also going fast."
While balancing the pressures
and work of medical school, where
she is earning both an MD and
Ph.D., IVoxell has not been able to
accumulate the impressive interna
tional resumes of some of her com
petitors, but she is not without in
ternational experience that may
prove invaluable in her quest for an
Olympic appearance.
After finishing third in the pur
suit event at the L'.S Nationals last
summer, IVoxell went to Berlin to
compete in the World Champi
onships, where I Voxell was pleased
with her new low time, 3:40.
"It was a very new experience,"
IVoxell said. "It was exciting to look

at people who've raced internation
ally and see how you stand up under
the pressure of going abroad and
having a good race. But I still have a
lot less international experience
than most."
Where Troxell doesn't lack is col
legiate experience. An avid biker
growing up and ati iathlete at Uni
versity of Virginia, it wasn't until
Troxell came to the Farm and
began riding with Stanford in 1994
that she got into bicycle racing.
"I always enjoyed tiding, but I
wouldn't have started racing il it
hadn't been for the team at Stan
lord. The guys on the team almost
broke my arm twisting it so hard to
get me into track rat ing."
Troxell had an immediate im
pact, helping secure the women's
collegiate championship in the team
time trial event in 1994 and 1995
and the toad race team champi
onship in 1995 and 199f>.
Individually she is equally well
decorated, with six national cham
pionships in the past live years. In
her last two seasons, the All-Ameri
can has reigned as queen oft he pur
suit and omnium — best all-around
on the track. I his past vear, Troxell
was also named Visa I SA cycling
collegiate w<nnan of the year.
Once called " I lie Metronome,"
I roxell's acute internal locus is one
of the qualities that Walker attribut
es to her succ ess.
"She has a very highK developed
sense of cadence with the speed .it
which the pedals are turning."
Walker said. "It's easier for her to
t ideal a constant speed than lot oth
ers, which is extremely impoi taut in
pursuit racing and is probably one
of the reasons she's so got xl."
Along with her consistent speed,
another thing that hasn't budged
has been I roxell's commitment to
the Stanford squad. Despite a three
year hiatus in Indianapolis, from
July of 1995 to January 1995, while
working on her l'lil) project, Trox
ell loyally came back t< > race It >t Stan
ford in the conference champi

unships and nationals.
And even as she rode her way to
l he top, I Voxel I has never forgotten
lhe team that gave her the love of
racing. Alter racing all week at the
Olympic I rack Trials, Troxell
hopped on .t flight to southern (lal
ifbrnia arriving 45 minutes before
Stanford's conference champi
onship, where she cleaned up with
first place finishes in the criterium,
road race and time trial.
"Kven when she has other big
irons on the fire, she has not ne
glected collegiate racing," Walker
said. "While collegiate hike rac ing is
not the highest form in the I .S., the
National Championships have
helped her In giving her familiaritv
with that scope of competition. But
tlicv haveitnpcjseclon her training."
Racing fin Stanford, training lor
the ()lympics, throw in stud) ingcell

biology and you've got a virtually
impossible combination, but Trox
ell manages to juggle it all.
"Everyone at Stanford has been
very supportive in letting me In
flexible," she said. Through travel
conflicts with mandatory rotations,
112 roxell has squeezed it all in to a
schedule that has little- time to spare.
But il I roxell receives ;i spot on the
Olympic team, she savs graduation
w ill just have to wait.
A spot on the Olympic Team
would join Iroxell with Stanford
alumna Nicole I rcedman '94, who
also qualified in the road race event.
"The ()lympics have been some
thing that 's only occurred to me re
ally recenth so I haven't built it up
or trained for years and years,"
I roxell said. "Kvervone wants to do
it and represent their country, but
it's almost hard to imagine."
