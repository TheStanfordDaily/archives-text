### BILL HANSON STAFF WRITER 
Revenge never tasted so sweet.
Two days after No. 2 Georgia
upset ihe top-ranked Cardinal for
the NCAA team title, Stanford's
Marissa lrvin and I aura Granville
each knocked off" a Bulldog in sec
ond round play at the NCAA Indi
vidual Championships in Malibu,
(lalif.
Irvin stormed past Georgia's Es
ther Knox, (>-4, f)-M, while Granville
routed Bulldog Marissa Catlin, 6-0,
6-2.
lrvin, the nation's top-ranked
player, is the t< nirnament's top seed.
Her win over Knox, however, was
her first straight-set win in four
mate lies.
In her first round match on
Monday, lrvin squeaked past
Michelle Fauc herof I exas, 6-3, 1-6,
6-2.
"I started out the- match well and
then had a mental lapse in the sec
ond set." Irvin said. "It is always
tough to win in the first round, es
pecially alter losing in the team
championship yesterday."
I rvin's unusually dose scores can
likely be attributed to serving prob
lems. In recent matches, her serving
statistic s have been dismal. Duringa
loss to Georgia's Aartlii Venkatesan
on Sunday, Irvin served 19 double
faults.

Some onlookers have encour
aged Irvin to roll in her first serves
in order to avoid hitting as many
second serves. Stanford assistant
coach l.ele Forood, however, dis
agrees with that advice.
"[lrvin]'s an aggressive player
with a big serve," Forood said. "Her
technique is just a litdeoff right now.
I'm telling her to keep going tor her
serve. She cannot liecome a reflex
ive player. She has a dictating
game."
When asked about the double
faults, lrvin was confident she
would find her range again soon.
"Everyone has something they
occasionally struggle with," she said.
Granville, on the other hand, is
playing flawless tennis.
In her first round match on
Monday, Granville crushed Vladka
Uhlirova of Texas, 6-2,6-2.
Despite her national ranking of
third, Granville is seeded #9-lb in
111 is tournament. The NCAA seed
ing committee, which seeds players
for the NCAA chainpionsllips, and
the Intercollegiate Tennis Asscxia
tion, which releases the national
rankings, use different criteria
when ranking players.
Sophomore Lauren Kalvaria
was also snubbed by the seeding
committee.
Although she is currently

kalvaria entered the tournament
unseeded.
On Monday, she lost to sixth seed
Allison Bradshaw of Arizona State,
6-1, 2-6, 6-3, in a match-up worth)
of a final.
Sophomore Keiko Tokuda also
suffered a tough three-set loss on
Monday, falling to Duke's Kris Sell,
3-6, 6-3, 6-2.
Tokuda, however, remains alive
in doubles competition with partner
I xiura Granville.
Irvin and senior leryn Ashley,
the tournament's top-seeded duo,

also made it to the third round of the
douhles competition, defeating
Georgia's tandem of Knox and
Venkatesan, 5-7, 6-3, 6-2, in sec ond
round action yesterday.
Ashley, who is struggling with a
back injury, was bounced from sin
gles competition yesterday, losing 6-
2, 2-6, 6-2 to Baylor's Jahnavi
Parekh.
"My back is bothering me off and
on," Ashley said. "But it doesn't
seem to bother me as much in dou
bles. I'm really looking forward to
the doubles."
In today's third round singles ac -
tion, Irvin will take on Ghin Bee
khoo of Arkansas, while Granville
will face fourth seed and defending
champion Zuzana Lesenarova of
the University of San Diego in one

of the tournament's most highly an
ticipated match-ups.
If she gets past Lesenarova,
Granville should enjoy a relatively
easy path to the final. USC star
Jewel Peterson looms as a possible
quarterfinal round opponent,
while fifth-seeded Venkatesan
could pose problems in the semifi
nals.
lis iu's path to the championship
round is also fairly obstacle-free.
Thus, an Irvin-Granville final is a
strong p< >ssibility.
"|Granville]'s playing very well,"
said head coach 112 rank Brennan.
"She's definitely a dark-horse to win
the tournament. Marissa Irvin is the
favorite to win the tournament.
Mavlxf it'll come down to an all-
Stanford final."
