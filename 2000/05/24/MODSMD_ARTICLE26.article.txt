Revenge never tasted so sweet.
Two days after No. 2 Georgia
upset ihe top-ranked Cardinal for
the NCAA team title, Stanford's
Marissa lrvin and I aura Granville
each knocked off" a Bulldog in sec
ond round play at the NCAA Indi
vidual Championships in Malibu,
(lalif.
Irvin stormed past Georgia's Es
ther Knox, (>-4, f)-M, while Granville
routed Bulldog Marissa Catlin, 6-0,
6-2.
lrvin, the nation's top-ranked
player, is the t< nirnament's top seed.
Her win over Knox, however, was
her first straight-set win in four
mate lies.
In her first round match on
Monday, lrvin squeaked past
Michelle Fauc herof I exas, 6-3, 1-6,
6-2.
"I started out the- match well and
then had a mental lapse in the sec

tough to win in the first round, es

with a big serve," Forood said. "Her
technique is just a litdeoff right now.
I'm telling her to keep going tor her
serve. She cannot liecome a reflex
ive player. She has a dictating
game."
When asked about the double
faults, lrvin was confident she
would find her range again soon.
"Everyone has something they
occasionally struggle with," she said.
Granville, on the other hand, is
playing flawless tennis.
In her first round match on
Monday, Granville crushed Vladka
Uhlirova of Texas, 6-2,6-2.
Despite her national ranking of
third, Granville is seeded #9-lb in
111 is tournament. The NCAA seed
ing committee, which seeds players
for the NCAA chainpionsllips, and
the Intercollegiate Tennis Asscxia
tion, which releases the national
rankings, use different criteria
when ranking players.
