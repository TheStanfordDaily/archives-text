# Reflections on a year in sports
## 
### 
This is a tough time to be
writing about college
sports, to be frank. Most
schools are out, and most
seasons are over. There's still plen
ty of exciting stories — we'll know
in a lew hours whether the men's
tennis team can bring home the
first Cardinal national champi
onship of the year — but the clis-

tance of most of the teams and the tournaments has
set most students on this campus into off-season
thinking.
What's left on campus for the sports fan? Not
much — the beginning of the postseason for baseball.
One of the joys of being a columnist, though, is that 1
can choose to go to baseball games without writing

about them, and leave the essence ol the baseball sea
son, its continuous day-in (lay-out How, as n should
be, rather than distilling it down to highlight mo
ments and box scores.
What's left, then? I must confess lhat m\ sympa
thies go out to the track. ( rew and baseball teams; as
1 slip into oil-season mode myself, I can't imagine
dealing with finals and summer plans at the same
time as I struggled for postseason glor\ and pi ide. I
can barely keep up with them at my computer, sweat
ing in my dorm room.
It's easy now to forget about the seasons this vcai s
had — the NBA and NHL are deep into plavofl
fever, major league baseball is hitting its suminci
stride and still has a few weeks be 112 i ire the plavofl < on-

tenders really separate themselves
from ihe field, even the MLS sea
son is kit king into gear, for those
of you who follow those things
(about six people on campus are
saying, "I ley, he's talking about
me!" right now). And let's say that
men's tennis gets upset by Vir
ginia Commonwealth, and the
track and field and baseball teams
don't pull off upsets — we could
be looking at the first champi
onship-less year for Stanford in
recent memory. What happened
to "the best year in Stanford sports
ever?"
Nostalgia, that's what. With the
heat hitting us now, it's a better
time than ever to indulge in the
wonderful pastime of "remember
the time ..." What's left for the
sports fan? Silting around a foun
tain, or a kiddie pool, or in the
shade of a tree, or on the grass at
Sunken Diamond, telling stories
that everyone's heard already
about that one Troy Walters catch
or Ronnie Fair goal or Exactly
Where You Were When We Lost
1 o North Carolina.
They might be stories that
you'll tell 20 years down the road
— the Rose Bowl, i lit* Santa Clara
men's soccer quadruple-overtime
battle — or they might be stories
that you won't even remember
next year — the way you talked the
C 'ihurros guy into giving you a free
one at Maples that one night. The
nice thing about this time of year is
that it doesn't really matter.
It's rare in life that you get the
time to sit and reflect on a whole
set of experiences, to remember
why you tlitl them and why you
liked them and why you hated
life during them. Surely it
doesn't happen much after col
lege, when the whole idea of
"summer vacation" goes out the
window. Surely it doesn't happen
any more in professional sports,
where 24-hour cable coverage of
salary disputes and Internet sto
ries on what youi home team's

general manager had for break
fast have combined to mean that
every sports league's season runs
365 days year, even if they aren't
playing games. Only those twin
forces for good — apathy and
cynicism — have conspired to
prevent this from happening in
men's college basketball; most
fans don't expend the energy to
follow promising high school re
cruits in summer league games,
at least yet.
But college sports, for now,
gives you the time for that — to sit
over the summer and remember
why you like being at the best ath
letic school in the country, without
being caught up in the constant
stream of games and tournaments
and dual matches. It's a time to
look at the 1999-2000 year: the
Year Of Second Place. It's not a
label the marketers down at the
athletic department will cling to;
we're not big on second place here
in the USA, even if we tlitl nail
tlown more of them than almost
anybody ever.
Nonetheless, the summertime
gives us time to look at all of those
almost-victories and all of the rub
ble of all those nationally-ranked
teams that all of our almost-win
ners left in their wakes and realize
that when you add it up, second
place isn't the worst thing in the
world. It's small consolation, per
haps, to most of the players, but
that's why they invented the Sears
Cup — to make Stanford fans
happy even when we don't win six
NCAA championships.
I'll gt) out on a limb here and
say that I couldn't be happier with
how things turned out this year.
And I'd like to thank all the ath
letes here and the athletic depart
ment for giving me something to
tit) with myself this summer: sit,
and reminisce, and tell stories of
"remember the time . . ." I'm pret
ty satisfied with that.

men's soccer quadruple-overtime
battle — or they might be stories
that you won't even remember
next year — the way you talked the
C 'ihurros guy into giving you a free
one at Maples that one night. The
nice thing about this time of year is
that it doesn't really matter.
It's rare in life that you get the
time to sit and reflect on a whole
set of experiences, to remember
why you tlitl them and why you
liked them and why you hated
life during them. Surely it
doesn't happen much after col
lege, when the whole idea of
"summer vacation" goes out the
window. Surely it doesn't happen
any more in professional sports,
where 24-hour cable coverage of
salary disputes and Internet sto
ries on what youi home team's

general manager had for break
fast have combined to mean that
every sports league's season runs
365 days year, even if they aren't
playing games. Only those twin
forces for good — apathy and
cynicism — have conspired to
prevent this from happening in
men's college basketball; most
fans don't expend the energy to
follow promising high school re
cruits in summer league games,
at least yet.
But college sports, for now,
gives you the time for that — to sit
over the summer and remember
why you like being at the best ath
letic school in the country, without
being caught up in the constant
stream of games and tournaments
and dual matches. It's a time to
look at the 1999-2000 year: the
Year Of Second Place. It's not a
label the marketers down at the
athletic department will cling to;
we're not big on second place here
in the USA, even if we tlitl nail
tlown more of them than almost
anybody ever.
Nonetheless, the summertime
gives us time to look at all of those
almost-victories and all of the rub
ble of all those nationally-ranked
teams that all of our almost-win
ners left in their wakes and realize
that when you add it up, second
place isn't the worst thing in the
world. It's small consolation, per
haps, to most of the players, but
that's why they invented the Sears
Cup — to make Stanford fans
happy even when we don't win six
NCAA championships.
I'll gt) out on a limb here and
say that I couldn't be happier with
how things turned out this year.
And I'd like to thank all the ath
letes here and the athletic depart
ment for giving me something to
tit) with myself this summer: sit,
and reminisce, and tell stories of
"remember the time . . ." I'm pret
ty satisfied with that.

Jeff Cooper, a junior, would like to
thank his editors at the Daily, the Stan
ford Athletic Department (particularly
liig Hob Camiesco and his off ice), and
all the teams about which he's written
this year.
