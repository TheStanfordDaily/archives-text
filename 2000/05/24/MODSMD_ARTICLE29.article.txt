Junior Alex Kim slices a ball in the national championship title match. Kim led his team to the national title, impressively
defeating his Virginia Commonwealth opponent 6-4, 6-2.
Stanford certainly answered its
critics.
"We were more ready this
year," said Ceoff Abranis, the
team's captain and only senior.
"Last year, we won the doubles
point [against Baylor], then let
things slide. People lost some
points and started to put their
lieads down. Ihe feeling lin
gered, but we were prepared [this
year]."
Abrains and the other four re
maining starters from last year's
team were determined not to fal
ter this season.
Junior Alex Kim made an in
credible jump from playing at the
No. 4 spot last season to No. 1 (his
year in singles. Kim has consis
tently led tlie Cardinal through
out the season.
Sophomore K.J. Hippensteel,
who was the No. 1 player in the
nation earlier this season, over
came a two month battle with a
ruptured spleen when most peo
ple thought his season was fin
ished.

Juniors Ali Ansari and Scotty
Scott have been the emotional
leaders of the team.
"Ali and Scotty are the heart
and soul of this team," said head
coach Dick (iould. " I hey played a
little last year, but both have real
ly improved over the season.
"They have played well all Near in
singles and doubles. I have been
as confident with [Ansari and
Scott) in doubles as I have with
our No. 1 team | Kim and
Abrams], who are the No. I team
in the nation."
With the addition of freshmen
David Martin, Scott Lipskv,
Garter Morris and Rvan llavi
land, and sophomore Chris
Meyer, this year's team was confi
dent that it could come to Athens
and take home another title.
Perhaps what makes this sea
son's national championship
team different from those in the
past is its "never give up" attitude
and the wa\ it has overcome ad
versity.
"The measure of a class team is
one that can respond to the pics
sure,'' Gould said. "Our team did
a great job all year long <>112 pla\ ing
in adverse situations to get to this
point."

11l is year's team might not
have been as dominant as the
other Cardinal c hampions in the
inid-1990's with the likes of four
lime All-American Paul Goldstein
and the Bryan twins, but it cer
tainh had the desire to win at all
costs, which the team proved the
entire season.
l or example, on April 9, the
Cardinal was battling then-No. 1
ranked I CLA with the score tied
3-3. I he match came down to No.
5 singles where Martin fought
back to defeat Lassi Ketola, 6-7, 6-
3, 6-4, in the exhausting 2 1/2-
hour match.
However, the Stanford players
not only battled in crucial situa
tions. I liev never let clou n all year,
even when the Cardinal would be
leading 5-0 or 6-0 with the dual
mate li alreach decided.
It seems ridiculous fora play
er to continue to struggle in a
grueling three-set marathon
when his teammates have al
readv secured the victory. But it
is in that mindset which pre
pared the Stanford players for
the pressure moments through
out the season and especially in
the NCAA tournament on its way
to vet another national title.
