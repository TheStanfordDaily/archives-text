semifinals of the Rolex lIA Indoor (Championships.
Because of his excellent play throughout the week,
Kim was named (lie Most Outstanding Performer of
this year's team tournament.
Keeping with tradition, Stanford began its champi
onship match against the Rams by playing extremely
well in doubles.
At No. 2, sophomore K.J. Hippensteel and fresh
man David Martin completely dominated Mattias
Hoglund and Mats Not in, 8-1.
With the match tied 1-1 early, the Stanford duo
reeled off eight straight games to give the Cardinal the
victory and a 1-0 lead in doubles. In the final game,

There is no shame in losing to Stanford."
This year's postseason run to the national champi

postseason victories. This accomplishment is second
only to the record-setting 1998 squad, which did not
lose a single point on its way to the national title. That
team dropped just three points all season en route to a
perfect 28-0 record.
Two other Cardinal teams, iu 1996 and 1997, lost
only two points in four NCAA matches on their way to
team championships.
Stanford has been nothing short of dominant since
the NO\A Championships went to its present dual for
mat in 1977. Since that time, the Cardinal has won 15
of a possible 24 national titles and has qualified for the
tournament on 22 times. The team has also racked up
an impressive 77-7 record in NCAA dual competition,
including 24 wins in its last 25 tries dating back to 1 995.
Stanford won four straight national championships
from 1995-98, three straight from 1988-90 and two in
a row in both 1977-78 and 1980-81.
With five starters returning next year, the (Cardinal
should l>e in prime condition to defend its national
championship and start another winning streak.
