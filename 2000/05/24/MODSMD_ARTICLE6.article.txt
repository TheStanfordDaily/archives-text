Recent research by the Stanford Uni
versity Medical Center indicates that low
back pain may have as much to do with a
patient's psychological condition as with
damaged vertebral disc s.
Researchers believe that the study will
revolutionize the way physicians diag
nose and treat back problems.
"For better or for worse, the identifi
cation of a c ertain kind of torn disc has
been one of the main tools used to diag
nose the cause of low back pain, and now
it looks like it's a lalse start in many pa
tients," said Eugene Carragee, the lead
author of the study and a Stanford asso
ciate professor of functional restoration.
Carragee and his collaborators will
receive the 1999 Volvo Corporation
Award for the Clinical Study of Low
Back l'ain, an international award
that recognizes research on low back

health care.
Stanford researchers conducted
magnetic resonance imaging scans and
discography tests on 9f> patients who
were at risk of low back pain. The team
found 25 percent of the people with
tears in vertebral discs had no corre
sponding symptoms of low back pain.
According to the results, the amount
of discomfort that patients had was
"most closely related to psychological
and social issues," said Carragee.
This suggests that people with low
coping skills, ongoing workers compen
sation claims or personal litigation relat
ed to back injury are more likely to have
symptoms of low back pain in their daily
activities.
"It is especially important to avoid
unnecessary, invasive and expensive
treatments, such as back fusions, that re
inforce the perception that the patient
has a grave disease of the spine," he said.
The study concludes that physicians

must take both the physical and emo
tional dimension into ac count when as
sessing how patients perceive back pain.
Mail) patients respond well to reas
surance and an active phvsical fitness
program, which can improve both their
back pain and sense of well-being, Car
ragee said.
He added that in some cases treat
ment for depression supports this regi
men. More intensive psvc hological ther
apies may be needed if the back pain is
reinforced In worker's compensation is
sues or aggravated l>\ problems at work
or home.
(larragee estimated that up to 30,000
back fusions are performed each vear in
the United States, although many of
them are ineffective in alleviating patient
discomfort.
Carragee also estimated that almost
five percent of the working population
in this country is disabled by this condi
tion on anv dav.
