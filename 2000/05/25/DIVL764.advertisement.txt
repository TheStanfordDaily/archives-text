Dear President Casper:
As you know, the janitors who clean our offices, class rooms, and public facilities are now negotiating a new contract with their
employer, American Building Maintenance. The current contract expires on May 31.
Most of the janitors now make $8.04 an hour, whereas a single adult and a child need at least $12.42 an hour to make ends meet.
Many of the janitors work two or three jobs and share apartments to make ends meet in our high-priced Silicon Valley area. The
company is proposing a wage increase of only $1.60 over the life of a five-year contract, lower rates for new hires in smaller build
ings, and a copayment of up to $71 a month for health insurance. Because of this inadequate offer, negotiations with the janitors
union, Service Employees International Union Local 1877, are bogged down.
We know that Stanford is not the janitors' direct employer. But we believe that the university should take responsibility to ensure
that all of those whose work makes our academic mission possible receive wages and benefits that enable them to afford decent
housing, food, and health care. Therefore, we are asking you to speak out and lend Stanford's voice to the janitors' efforts to win a
fair contract.
The recent experience of janitors in Los Angeles has shown that community support can be effective in helping janitors win a con
tract that will allow them to live with dignity. Vice-President A 1 Gore, Senators Diane Feinstein and Ted Kennedy, Cardinal
Mahoney, the mayor of Los Angeles and the largest office-space owner in the city all lent their support to the Los Angeles janitors
in their recent strike. Stanford will be in good company if we express support for a fair contract for the janitors who work here, and
this would set an excellent example for our neighbors in Silicon Valley.
