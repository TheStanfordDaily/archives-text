Wondering how you'll fill your empty days in the fall?
Dreading the hours of ennui? Like movies? Music? Theater
(but most definitely NOT theatre)? Looking for a place to do
great writing and work with a loving, nurturing editorial staff?
E-mail Eno or Jung at intermission@daily.stanford.edu and
join Intermission. You'll never regret it. Really. I promise.
