Sentencing bill fails in vote
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — lawmakers have re
jected a bill, inspired by the Ijm Angeles polite scandal,
that would have barred judges from imposing longer
prison sentences on convicted defendants simply because
ihey continue to maintain their innocence.
The suite Senate rejected the measure by Demcxratic
Sen. 1 om Hayden on an 18-16 vote Wednesday.
Hayden said the bill was prompted by a case stemming
from the police corruption scandal. Javier ()vando, a Los
Angeles gang member, was wounded and then framed by
two police officers who said he pointed a gun at them.
Ovando was given a maximum 23-year sentence be
cause the judge said he showed no remorse. Ovando,
shot and paralyzed from the waist down, said he was in
nocent but didn't remember what happened.
He was freed from prison last September after serving
three years of his assault sentence. Prosecutors have
di opped charges against more than 80 other defendants
whose convictions involved police officers named in the
scandal.

Gates, Cambridge plan new
version of Rhodes awards
The University of Cambridge, in Britain, confirmed
reports Tuesday that it was holding discussions with the
Microsoft cofbunder Bill Cates about a $200-million en
dowment to create a program similar to the University of
Oxford's prestigious Rhodes scholarships.
"The University of Cambridge has put a proposal to
the Bill Cates Foundation proposing that the foundation
endow a global scholarship program," a spokesman said.
Mr. Cates has already given the university $19-inillion for
a new computer laboratory.
Cambridge has won a reputation as Britain's premier
infbrmation-technology-research center, and start-up
businesses connected with the university have populated
the surrounding area, which is often called "Silicon Fen."
The plan that has been proposed to the Bill and Melinda
Cates Foundation would pay for 230 scholars, selected on
merit from any country in the world, to study any subject
at Cambridge at the graduate level. I lie university
spokesman stressed that "nothing has yet been finalized."
Comparisons have already been drawn with Oxford's
Rhodes program. Cecil Rhodes, a British colonial adven
turer with extensive commercial interests in southern
Africa, established a trust — now worth $312-million —
to support the Oxford scholarship program. Kadi year
32 Americans are selected, along with students from Aus
tralia, New Zealand, South Africa, and other countries.

BU fights for a ... big rock
A boulder sitting on a well-trod corner of Boston Uni
versity has, for over two decades, served as a colorful bill
iard for whoever happened along with can <>l paint
and a message, from campaign slogans to (ireek symbols.
But beginning about a year ago, a police officer had his
own message for the rock: Cet lost. "It's an eyesore," .is
serts Massachusetts State Police Sgt. Michael Benoit.
It's not just that the rock looks bad. According to
Sergeant Benoit, the messages on the rock are simply graf
fiti, and that may attract vandals, not to mention more
graffiti. Mr. Benoit says he sent letters to university officials
last spring, asking that the rcxk Ix- rolled farther onto the
campus — and farther from state property, the Boston
University Bridge, which crosses the Charles River.
University officials are perplexed by what seems to be
a one-man crusade. A spokesman, Kevin Carleton, says
that the sergeant's appeal in the Free Press in April was
Ihe first he'd heard <>112 the officer's l< h k-s< >licl opposition to
the campus icon. And, Mr. Carleton says,even if they had
received a letter, officials wouldn't budge any more than
the rock.
