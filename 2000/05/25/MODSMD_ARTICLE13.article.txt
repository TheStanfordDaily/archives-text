1928
Stanford students had original ways to
deal with the end-of-year stress associated
with finals in the Roaring '20s. In a short!
piece with the headline "Petition Protest*
Ban on Mud Fight by Ex Committee," The
Daily wrote:
"A petition has been drawn up with fifty
names attached to oppose the action taken
by the Kx Committee last fall to discontinue
the annual mudfight in favor of a tie-up.
The written protest has been handed to the
Ex Committee and action will be taken on it
on Tuesday. The petition is an instrument
purporting to show that the sentiment of the
student body is for adhering to the mud
fight tradition.
" The mudfight was abandoned last fall
quarter by the Ex Committee partly because
of a letter received from President Wilbur
strenuously opposing it."
The Bottom Line: Everybody prefers a good
mud fight to an unsynchronizea primal scream.
