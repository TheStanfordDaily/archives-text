• • Trust me; your school doesn't
need more money. It can invest in
South Africa now. Universities are
some of the richest institutions in the
world. My school, Stanford, has an
endowment larger than Milton
Berle's. It has purchased ridiculously
expensive pointy metal art installa
tions and put them in the middle of a
playing space for faculty children just
because it had to use up some art
fund. It needs money like I need a call
from Milton Berle about that endow
ment joke.
... So when those giggly freshmen
call you asking for money for their
endowment fund, think of the 40
percent of the Indian population
that is illiterate or the 25 percent of
the sub-Saharan Africans who have
HIV That's where my money will go
— right after I buy a satellite dish to
watch the Stanford basketball team.
They're so damn good.
