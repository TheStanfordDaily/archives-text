## Mbeki defends AIDS policies 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” South Afrit an Presi
dent I habo Mbeki, responding to concerns that his
country isn't dealing effectively with the AIDS epi
demic, defended his health policies dining a tjuict
visit to a city known for its vocal AIDS activism.
Mbeki has been criticized for entertaining the the
ories of University of California virologist lVter
Duesberg, who claims that HIV is not the cause of
AIDS. Mbeki h as also considered the notion that
AZ I , a drug used to slow the progress of AIDS, does
more harm than good.
(aitic s say by rehashing widely accepted concepts,
Mbeki is diverting time, energy and resources while
the epidemic rages. Four million South Africans, or
about one in every 10 citizens, is infected with 11IV.
After a speech on the South African economy that
Mbeki gave to the Commonwealth Club and the
World Affairs Counc il, two nonprofit public-affairs
groups, be said in response to a question that his
government is studying the best ways to confront

AIDS.
"We want to make sure our response is effective,
spec ific, focused and produces results," he said.
There were no protesters inside or outside the
Fairmont Hotel, where Mbeki delivered his speech.
I le later spoke to a small group of newspaper editors
and columnists.
The South African government has not made
strong new AIDS drugs available through the public
health system and has refused to endorse the use of
A/I in pregnant AIDS patients, despite proof it cuts
the c hance that newborns will be infected.
Five major drug companies have offered to cut
the price of HIV and other AIDS treatments. But
even at reduced prices, the cost of such drugs would
"consume the totality of the government's health
budget," Mbeki told the journalists.
Additionally, he said, drug treatment is a compre
hensive program the* government is not set up to
provide.
