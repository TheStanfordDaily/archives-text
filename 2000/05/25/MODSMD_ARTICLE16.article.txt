# Smokers' urine may be tested

### 
BOSTON (AP) â€” Stepping up
its battle with the tobacco industry,
the state Department of Public
Health is planning to force
cigarette makers to test smokers'
urine to show how much nicotine
gets into their bodies.
The new testing proposal, if
approved by the state's Public
Health Council, would require the
makers of 15 brands of cigarettes to
observe the smoking habits of 65
smokers per brand to determine
how their products are used in the
"real world."
Companies would then have to
test the urine of those smokers over
24 hours to determine how much
nicotine and other carcinogens get

into their bloodstream.
Massachusetts would apparently
be the first state to do the tests.
They're the latest effort by the state
health department to ensure smok
ers know exactly what they're
exposed to when they light up.
"This regulation is (about) a
smoker's right to know," said Cireg
Connolly, director of the depart
ment's tobacco control program.
Since 1996, the industry has
refused to comply with a state
demand to release the ingredients
in its cigarettes. I hat issue is now in
court.
Hi it in 1998, the state asked
cigarette makers to release the
exact contents of the smoke pro

duced by their cigarettes. The
industry complied earlier this year,
and health department officials are
now reviewing the information.
Data produced through the tests
would validate the smoke content
information, Connolly said. The
testing proposal will be the subject
of public hearings this summer and
could be passed as early as this (all.
The data from the smoke con
tents combined with the urine test
results would be the most complete
picture, outside of the industry, of
what is in cigarettes, according to
Edward L Sweda Jr., senior attor
ney with the Tobacco Control
Resource Center at Northeastern
University School of Law.
