# House approves China trade bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The House gave deci
sive bipartisan approval yesterday to a fiercely
debated bill to normalize trade with China, hand
ing a big foreign policy win to President Clinton
and corporate America and a bruising defeat to
organized labor.
On a 2'57-197 vote, the House voted to grant
permanent normal trade relations to Beijing and
to end 20 years of turbulent annual reviews.
That was 19 more than the 218 votes needed
for passage, a far more comfortable margin than
either side had predicted.
Members stood on the floor watching trans
fixed as red and green lights on the electric tote
board lighted up, and supporters broke into
applause when the magic 2KS number was sur
passed.
Clinton appeared in the Rose Garden moments
after the final vote to praise the House. "At this
stage in China's development, we will have more
positive influence with an outstretched hand than
with a clenched fist," Clinton said.
He noted that with 1.25 billion people, "China
is the largest new market in the world." He said
the outcome was particularly welcome after the
enactment earlier this month of a bill to expand
trade with Africa, Central America and the
Caribbean.
Clinton said he would turn his attention to
helping to push the bill through the Senate.
House Speaker Dennis Hasten, R-1 11., who
forged an alliance with Clinton to rally support for
the measure, said: "The Chinese market is open
ing. Somebody is going to have an opportunitx to
sell to this vast new market. The question is, W ho

will be there when it opens?"
I he measure would open the way for American
businesses to take full advantage of a series of mar
ket-opening concessions China has made to join
the World Trade Organization.
Opponents said liberalizing trade ties with
China would reward a brutal regime and cost
American jobs.
"You can't have free markets without free peo
ple," complained House Minority Whip David
Bonior of Michigan, the chief Democratic oppo
nent.
1 he bill next goes to the Senate, where it has
always drawn far wider bipartisan support than in
the House. The measure has already won the 18-
1 backing of the Senate Finance Committee and
was expected to win full Senate approval early
next month.
()pponents lost a last-ditch effort, shortly before
the final vote, to send the legislation back to com
mittee to modify it to revoke trade benefits if
China invades or blockades Taiwan. That move
was rejected 258-176.
Supporters said the president already has this
power and the move was just another way to kill
the bill.
Clinton worked the phones throughout the
afternoon to nail down wavering Democrats, sup
porters said. Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the like
ly GOP presidential nominee, also was busy trying
to win over wavering Republicans.
Republican leaders had said they thought they
could deliver 150 votes; they came up with 164.
Democratic sponsors of the bill set a goal of 70-80;
they produced 73.


U.S. Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert (R-ll) laughs as he reads the fortune from a large fortune cookie
after voting.
