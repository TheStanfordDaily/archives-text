# Government asked to revise breakup plan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The federal
judge in llie Microsoft antitrust case yester
day gave the Justice Department two days to
revise its plan to break up the software giant,
possibly into three parts instead of two, and
rejected the company's pleas for more time
to respond.
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jack
son ordered (hat revisions be based on issues
raised in yesterday's hearing, including the
possibility of splitting Microsoft into three
new companies — for operating systems,
Microsoft Office and other software, and a
new one for the Internet Explorer Web
browser.
Under the current Justice plan, one com
pany would sell operating systems and the
second would develop and market
Microsoft's popular Office software and
Internet properties. Justice officials had no
immediate comment on whether their
revised plan would include a third company.
Jackson dismissed a request from
Microsoft that he hear evidence in the mat
ter. "I contemplate no further process," he
said.
"This case has been pending for two years
now," Jackson snapped when company
lawyers pleaded for more time. Microsoft
apparently will have until Tuesday to
respond to the government's updated plan.
Microsoft, in a last-minute filing, had
hoped to call a series of new witnesses,
including Hill Gates, the company chairman,
and Steve Ballmer, the chief executive offi

cer, as well as Wall Street investment bankers
and experts from academia.
Jackson said he will decide what punish
ment to impose after reviewing the govern
ment's updated plan and Microsoft's
response, without additional testimony. He
ruled in early April that Microsoft had
engaged in business practices that violated
antitrust laws. The company has said it will
appeal the case.
David Boies, the Justice Department's spe
cial trial counsel, said that plan would "take
into account the day's proceedings." He
refused to say if it would include the three
way breakup.
Also discussed yesterday was whether
Microsoft's newest operating system, Win
dows 2000, is compatible with other operat
ing systems and whether Microsoft should
release the computer source code for its
products to its partners and competitors.
Microsoft said that would cost die company
billions.
William Kovacic, an antitrust expert at
George Washington University's School of
Law, said a quick decision on breaking up
Microsoft would provide fertile ground for
appeal.
"I don't understand it. Clearly, he has a
keen sense to wrap this up, and that he is
emphasizing speed over process," Kovacic
said.
"But if you step back for a second, this will
be one of the two or three most important
corporate restructurings in the United States.

Isn't it worth taking a couple of months to get
it right?"
I'he company's general counsel, William
Neukom, said Jackson's action moves the case
"very near" to the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit, which
Microsoft views as a friendlier venue for its
case.
"On appeal, Microsoft will be raising chal
lenges to the procedures used throughout the
trial, including the remedies phase,' he told
reporters outside the courthouse.
Added company attorney |ohn Warden:
"We l(X)k forward to the appellate's scrutiny."
Earlier yesterday, Jackson wondered aloud
whether he could simply send the cast* to the
appeals court without imposing a punish
ment on Microsoft.
"Why can't we just defer that until the
court of appeals has had a crack at it?" Jack
son asked Boies, who cited federal laws that a
final order, including a remedy, must be
signed before a case can move to an appeals
court.
Jackson also questioned whether a poten
tial breakup might work better if the
Microsoft were split into two identical pieces,
instead of along product lines. A brief filed
earlier in the case "pointed out that this would
simply create two monopolies, both of which
would be dominant," Jackson said.
The Justice Department and 17 of the 19
states that filed the initial antitrust complaint
against Microsoft want to create two new and
distinct companies.
