# Study reveals student sleep patterns

Baffling the residents of the 24-hour study
room, a recent time-use study conducted by
the Dean of Students Office reported that the
average Stanford student sleeps eight hours a
day.
The survey asked the students in Psychiatry
Prof. William Dement s "Sleep and Dreams"
class last quarter to record their activities for a
one-week period.
Students could select from 26 different activ
ity categories to report their time use in 15-
minute increments on the survey's Web site.
The purpose of the study, according to Dean
of Students Marc Wais, is to "provide a portrait
of how Stanford undergraduates truly spend
their time."
"It is important for students to reflect upon

how they use their time here at Stanford be
cause there are so many options but so little
time for college students," Wais said. "Students
must evaluate and carefully select the activities
they truly want to pursue to make the best of
their Stanford experience."
This year's survey sampled 384 students, of
which 53.9 percent were female and 45.3 per
cent were male. Freshmen represented the
highest percentage of the sample, making up
48.2 percent of the participants.
This is a much larger pool of people than
1998's student time-use study, which consisted
of only 70 unpaid volunteers recruited from
undergraduate residences.
The study found that students slept an aver
age of about 8 hours a day, including naps, with
males sleeping slightly more than females.
Many students were surprised by such a
high average.

Freshman Yasmin Owusu said, "Between
taking my pre-med requirements and partici
pating in extracurricular activities, I average
about five hours of sleep per night. The eight
hour average definitely seems high for the av
erage Stanford student."
Brie Boutin, a freshman involved in the
study, said, "I think the average is relatively
high, but that is probably a result of the class.
Because 1 was taking 'Sleep and Dreams,' I def
initely made an effort to monitor my sleeping
habits, getting as much sleep as possible."
Dement said that "although students are al
most getting their eight-and-a-half hour re
quirement of sleep, they still should try to sacri
fice other less important activities to get more
rest."
