# Study reveals student sleep patterns
## 
### JESS DANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Baffling the residents of the 24-hour study
room, a recent time-use study conducted by
the Dean of Students Office reported that the
average Stanford student sleeps eight hours a
day.
The survey asked the students in Psychiatry
Prof. William Dement s "Sleep and Dreams"
class last quarter to record their activities for a
one-week period.
Students could select from 26 different activ
ity categories to report their time use in 15-
minute increments on the survey's Web site.
The purpose of the study, according to Dean
of Students Marc Wais, is to "provide a portrait
of how Stanford undergraduates truly spend
their time."
"It is important for students to reflect upon

how they use their time here at Stanford be
cause there are so many options but so little
time for college students," Wais said. "Students
must evaluate and carefully select the activities
they truly want to pursue to make the best of
their Stanford experience."
This year's survey sampled 384 students, of
which 53.9 percent were female and 45.3 per
cent were male. Freshmen represented the
highest percentage of the sample, making up
48.2 percent of the participants.
This is a much larger pool of people than
1998's student time-use study, which consisted
of only 70 unpaid volunteers recruited from
undergraduate residences.
The study found that students slept an aver
age of about 8 hours a day, including naps, with
males sleeping slightly more than females.
Many students were surprised by such a
high average.

Freshman Yasmin Owusu said, "Between
taking my pre-med requirements and partici
pating in extracurricular activities, I average
about five hours of sleep per night. The eight
hour average definitely seems high for the av
erage Stanford student."
Brie Boutin, a freshman involved in the
study, said, "I think the average is relatively
high, but that is probably a result of the class.
Because 1 was taking 'Sleep and Dreams,' I def
initely made an effort to monitor my sleeping
habits, getting as much sleep as possible."
Dement said that "although students are al
most getting their eight-and-a-half hour re
quirement of sleep, they still should try to sacri
fice other less important activities to get more
rest."
Another participant, freshman Jeff Glenn,

said, " The time-use study almost
made me feel embarassed about
seeing how much time I waste
away procrastinating.
"I definitely have given up
many opportunities to do activi
ties I really enjoyed because 1 felt
that I didn't have time," Glenn
said, "but I easily could have if
[they were] more efficient with
my schedule."
Glenn's feelings truly reflect the
purpose of this study, according to
Wais. "How students spend their
time is vital to the quality of their
life at Stanford, and we want them
to get the most of their time here
by understanding how they spend
their day," said Wais.
Another element of the survey
questioned the legend that Stan
ford students don't date. Accord
ing to the study, about one out of
three Stanford students has a
boyfriend or girlfriend, with up
perclassmen leading freshmen in
that category, 37.1 percent to 22.2
percent of freshmen.
Glenn said, " These numbers
make complete sense. Upper
classmen are definitely more fo
cused, knowing what they want
from a relationship. Plus they
have had more time to meet more
people."
Beyond dating, upperclassmen
are also more focused in acade
mics. Although upperclassmen
study less than freshmen, Boutin

attributes that to the fact that
freshmen are less time efficient
and much more likely to get dis
tracted.
Some gender gaps were also ev
ident in the survey; while 18.8 per
cent of the females surveyed par
ticipate in community service, only
9.8 percent of the males surveyed
did so. Â«
Glenn felt there was some valid
ity in this statistic. "Females are
generally more giving and car
ing," he said. "Males do just
enough to get by."
Accordingly, females also made
up a larger percentage of students
involved in paid, part-time posi
tions.
Wais said that he really could
not see a justification for this rer- 1
suit. However, 1998's time-use
study provided a similar breaks
down of men and women involved!
in part-time employment and;
community service.
The smiliar findings of the 1998>
and 2000 surveys have been help-,
ful to the Dean of Students Office'
iti understanding the lives of col
lege students, Wais said.
"Implementing the Stanford
After Midnight program is defi
nitely related to the results of the
1998 study," Wais said. "Most stu-;
dents do not go to bed until two op
three in the morning, and we
thought it would be beneficial to
provide services for them through"
later hours," said Wais.
