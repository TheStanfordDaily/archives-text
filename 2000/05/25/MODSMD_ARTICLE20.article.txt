# Crayons remain safe
## 
### 
(AP) — Responding to a pub
lished report that crayons contain
asbestos, the nation's leading
crayon maker maintained yester
day that its products are safe.
Crayola said an independent
government-certified lab came
back with results late Tuesday
that found no asbestos in its
crayons. No more details were
released about those results.
I lie company was awaiting
results from several other inde
pendent labs about the safety of
its crayons, called into question by
a newspaper report that two gov
ernment-certified labs found
asbestos in crayons made by three
major manufacturers. Asbestos
can be harmful if inhaled.
Of 40 crayons that were tested
lor the Seattle Post-Intelligencer,
[V2 were contaminated above trace
levels, the newspaper reported.
There are no known reports of
anyone getting sic k from using or
making crayons. And asbestos
related illness tends to result from
exposure to airborne fibers —
usually in an industrial setting.
The asbestos in crayons is
reportedly found in talc, which is
used to keep crayons from break
ing. Crayola, while not conceding
any safety problems, said it is
researching alternatives to talc.
For nearly 100 years, Crayola

has made crayons at its plant in
Easton, Pa., where it also has a
factory tour and playshop. Some
worried parents have called the
company's consumer hotline, but
a spokeswoman said most callers
were more curious than upset.
"We are hearing from some,
but it hasn't been an enormous
number," Crayola spokeswoman
l racey Muldoon Moran said ves
terday. "I think that goes to the
100 years of trust we've built up.
The company's Web site was
updated Tuesday with safety facts,
including a statement from the
company's independent toxicolo
gist and short answers to com
monly asked questions about
asbestos and crayons. The Web
site, as has been policy before,
urged parents to speak to a doctor
if their child has swallowed
crayons.
Crayola was alerted to the
newspaper report Friday, and
spent the weekend setting up tests
with a variety of independent
government-approved labs to
provide supporting data, Moran
said. Results are expected
throughout the week.
Crayola crayons have been
approved as non-toxic by the
industry's Art & Creative Materials
Institute, which certifies art sup
lilies for safety, the company said.
