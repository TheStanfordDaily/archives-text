## The
						Stanford Daily University must defend decent wages for its workers 
### 
THE JANITORS AT Stanford
and throughout the Bay Area
have been campaigning for
detent wages and health care
tor several months now. At Stanford, work
ers and students have presented petitions
and letters of concern to University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper and Vice Provost for
Facilities Chris Christofferson, urging
them to publicly support Stanford janitors
in their efforts to rise out of poverty.
Thus far, University officials have
refused to publicly support the janitors.
They have shirked responsibility for

ensuring a fair contract by posturing a
"neutral" position. They claim that the
University, as the indirect employer, does
not have a right to make a statement to
support the janitors. Yet, evidence to the
contrary abounds.
As The Daily hits noted in the past,
companies and building owners in Los
Angeles have publicly supported the jani
tors they indirectly employ. Johns Hop
kins University hits similarly publicly stat
ed a commitment to respect and livable
wages for Hopkins workers. Recent
reports of an alliance between a Silicon

Valley biotechnology company and Ser
vice Employees International Union
Local No. 1877 suggest that alliances
between indirect employers and workers
are not rare. It would not be outlandish
for Stanford to follow suit and support its
workers.
This week, over 70 faculty and affiliate
faculty members signed an open letter to
Casper urging the University to "lend
Stanford's voice to the janitors' efforts to
win a fair contract." Signers hail from the
Schools of Business, Education, Law,
Engineering, and the Humanities and

Sciences. The University cannot ignore
the increasingly clear and substantial con
cerns of members of the Stanford com
munity.
The strong faculty support evidenced
by the open letter, coupled with the
expressed concerns of workers and stu
dents, suggests that the concerned parties
comprise more than a radical fringe of the
Stanford community.
As the May 31 expiration date of the
current contract approaches, we urge the
University to shed disinterest and defend
decent wages for its workers.
