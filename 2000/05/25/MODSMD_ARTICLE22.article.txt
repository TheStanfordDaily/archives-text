# MODERN LIFE IS RUBBISH
## A
						Good vs. Bad gallery 
### 
It's traditional to do something dis
tinctive and grandiose for one's
swan song. This being the final
installment of this column, it
seems only fair to take opinions writing
to its logical extreme and spout of! a
series of unconnected snap judgments;
a sort of Good vs. Bad gallery. Every
one is encouraged to disagree with
them.
Good propaganda: BlowTheDo-

t Out You rAss.com.
This is simply brilliant
because it's an anti Web
site Web site. The
premise is simple: they
put up posters to be
downloaded by you in
Adobe Acrobat format
with delightfully juve
nile slogans along the
lines of their domain

name.
People then download them, print
them, stick them up in public places in
San Francisco, take pictures, send the pic
tures back to the site and the cycle begins
anew. Of course its petty, but how can
you not love guerrilla advertising?
Bad propaganda: the glut of full-page
ads, paid for by investment companies,
which appeared iu The New York limes
business section the Monday after the
recent Nasdaq crash. The not-so-clever
slogans varied, but the message was sim
ple: of course the market's inflated, but
please a) keep investing, and b) pay us to
invest for you.
After all, the maddeningly circular
logic behind the market — as long as
nobody's worried, nobody has to worry
— has held up so far. It's rather like
learning to fly in the Douglas Adams
"Hitchhiker's Guide" books: anyone can
do it, so long as they don't stop to realize
that they can't.
Good research: a recent Hawaiian
study suggesting that drinking coffee
may reduce the risk of Parkinson's dis
ease. Granted, it's not earth shattering,
but it's nice to hear a study with a mes
sage other than that everything we enjoy
will eventually kill us.
Bad research: the Harvard study
revealing that G-rated children's movies
— gasp — contain violence, and that
this violence is detrimental enough to
our children to justify writing up a pon
derous study and publishing it in the
Journal of the American Medical Associ
ation.
Every movie the researchers watched
contained at least one act of violence.
This may sound alarming, until you real
ize that by their definition "acts of vio

lence" include slapstick pratfalls like
objects flying through the air and hitting
|)ad guys in the butt.
It's hard to imagine a children's movie
without this, short of an animated version
of "My Dinner With Andre."
And, in any case, everyone knows it
was the cool kids whose parents let them
watch "The Terminator."
Good news for the future: anything
involving NASA. Despite a previous arti
cle making light of the hapless Mars Polar
lender, this columnist is still entirely in
favor of sending expensive equipment
into space.
The International Space Station is
cool. The NF.AR Shoemaker spacecraft is
cool, mainly because all the asteroids it's
meeting with have saucy Grecian names
like Eros and Circe.
The Galilee Project is cool because
some people think there might be life on
Jupiter's moon Europa, in which case we
can only hope that the aliens would be
called "Enrollash."
Bad news for the future: "Battlefield:
Earth."
Good social policy: the Presbyterian
church, which has just joined the Unitar
ians, certain Episcopalian churches and
Reform synagogues in allowing holy
unions for gay couples. Now if only some
one would do something about that Dr.
I.a ura show.
Bad social policy: the National Rifle
Association, which has responded to the
Million Mom March by trotting out a
group of gun-owning mothers and hav
ing them talk to the media. "1 love my
children," says one mother, "and 1 want
to have the right to protect them." Apple
pie and automatic weapons: it's the
American way.
Good Stanford: that raft out at
It's got a picnic table and some real
ly comfy chairs, though it was better last
month before all the weeds and bugs
showed up. Other than that, what's not to
love?
Bad Stanford: decreasing indignation
over the redesigned CoHo. At the begin
ning of the year, everyone was righteous
ly indignant over the attempt to turn an
alterna-cultural center into a thinly dis
guised sports bar. Then everyone forgot
about it.
Where are all the angry young interi
or decorators when we need them?
This columnist estimates two years
before Starbucks buys Wilbur Dining.
Until then, happy trails.
