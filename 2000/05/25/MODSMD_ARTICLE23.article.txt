Stanford Egyptian Association officer
responds to Arab-Israeli debate
In their letters to The Daily on May 22,
Michael Rotkowitz ("Manipulation of
facts on the Arab-Israeli issue") and Ben
Axelrod ("Debate over MSAN banner
turned into finger pointing debacle") said
that MSAN banner supporters in the past
few days manipulated the facts and
changed the debate into finger pointing.
I hope that they apply their advice to
themselves first.
Rotkowitz wrote, "Yet Egypt and Syria
lost the war anyway. Then Israel gave
back most of the land at the urging of the
United States, including the Sinai and the
Suez Canal.
"Somehow, Egypt is proud of this.
When I visited last summer, I was
shocked to see many bridges and roads
commemorating Oct. 6, the day in 1973
when they cowardly attacked during
Yom Kippur. This represents more than
a disagreement on historical facts and
shows why the road to peace lias been so
difficult."
I must mention that what the Israelis
call the Yom Kippur war is called in
Egypt "The 10th of Ramadan â€” 6th of
October war." It occurred during the
month of Ramadan when Muslims fast all
day long and is sacred to all Muslims.
Maybe Israel thought that the fasting
Egyptians were not able to free their
occupied land. It seems we were "cow
ards" according to Rotkowitz to even

dream of redeeming our land. We should
have informed Israel about the date and
time we planned to regain our possession
and see if it suits their schedule.
Every country can hide the facts from
its people and the leaders can manipulate
them. Thus, in my comments, I will not
quote any Egyptian official. I will quote
some Israeli officials just to answer
Rotkowitz's claims about who won the
war:
Quoting Aharon Yarev, former direc
tor of Israeli Intelligence: "Undoubtedly,
the Arabs came out of the war victorious,
while we, in terms of image and feeling,
came out torn out and weak. When asked
if he won the war, Sadat replied, "Look at
what is going on in Israel after the war
and you will know the answer to this
question." (Symposium on October War,
Jerusalem, Sept. 1(5, 1974)
Quoting Moshe Dayan, Israeli defense
minister during the October War: " The
war has shown that we were no stronger
than the Egyptians. The halo of suprema
cy and the political and military premise
that Israel is stronger than the Arabs; that
they would be defeated should they dare
to start war did not hold true. It was the
ory that it would take them the whole
night to erect bridges, which we could
prevent, using our armored vehicles. But
it turned out that it was not easy to pre
vent them. Our exercise to send tanks to
the battle front was very costly. We have
never expected that. (Press Conference,
Oct. 9, 1973)

From Israeli newspapers: "Up to the
date of cease-fire on the Sinai front we
had not caused injury to the Egyptian
army. Definitely, even failing the cease
fire, we would not be able to stop or
destroy the Egyptian army. Thus, it can
be said that during our fourth war with
the Arabs, we have realized nothing."
(Haarts, Nov. 18, 1973)
On top of that, on Nov. 18, 1973, the
Israeli Government issued a decree estab
lishing the Agranat Committee chaired
by the Head of the Supreme Court, Dr.
Shimon Agranat. This committee was a
legal investigation committee, set up
under the law on investigation commit
tees.
The committee held the head and
assistant head of Military Intelligence Ser
vice liable for the gross miscalculation of
the situation on the eve of the war and
the first day of war operations. Both com
manders failed to give adequate warning
to the Israeli army, leading to tremen
dous confusions in the preparedness of
troops along the fronts and their deploy
ment over the Suez Canal front.
Premier Golda Meir resigned after the
release of the partial, interim report of
the committee in April 1974.
As for Axel rod's comments regarding
threats from Egypt to Israel, I wonder if
he knows that Egypt's President Sadat in
1971 called for peace in exchange of the
occupied land. The United States sup
