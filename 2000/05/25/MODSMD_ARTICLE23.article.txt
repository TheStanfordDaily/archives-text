Stanford Egyptian Association officer
responds to Arab-Israeli debate
In their letters to The Daily on May 22,
Michael Rotkowitz ("Manipulation of
facts on the Arab-Israeli issue") and Ben
Axelrod ("Debate over MSAN banner
turned into finger pointing debacle") said
that MSAN banner supporters in the past
few days manipulated the facts and
changed the debate into finger pointing.
I hope that they apply their advice to
themselves first.
Rotkowitz wrote, "Yet Egypt and Syria
lost the war anyway. Then Israel gave
back most of the land at the urging of the
United States, including the Sinai and the
Suez Canal.
"Somehow, Egypt is proud of this.
When I visited last summer, I was
shocked to see many bridges and roads
commemorating Oct. 6, the day in 1973
when they cowardly attacked during
Yom Kippur. This represents more than
a disagreement on historical facts and
shows why the road to peace lias been so
difficult."
I must mention that what the Israelis
call the Yom Kippur war is called in
Egypt "The 10th of Ramadan â€” 6th of
October war." It occurred during the
month of Ramadan when Muslims fast all
day long and is sacred to all Muslims.
Maybe Israel thought that the fasting
Egyptians were not able to free their
occupied land. It seems we were "cow
ards" according to Rotkowitz to even

dream of redeeming our land. We should
have informed Israel about the date and
time we planned to regain our possession
and see if it suits their schedule.
Every country can hide the facts from
its people and the leaders can manipulate
them. Thus, in my comments, I will not
quote any Egyptian official. I will quote
some Israeli officials just to answer
Rotkowitz's claims about who won the
war:
Quoting Aharon Yarev, former direc
tor of Israeli Intelligence: "Undoubtedly,
the Arabs came out of the war victorious,
while we, in terms of image and feeling,
came out torn out and weak. When asked
if he won the war, Sadat replied, "Look at
what is going on in Israel after the war
and you will know the answer to this
question." (Symposium on October War,
Jerusalem, Sept. 1(5, 1974)
Quoting Moshe Dayan, Israeli defense
minister during the October War: " The
war has shown that we were no stronger
than the Egyptians. The halo of suprema
cy and the political and military premise
that Israel is stronger than the Arabs; that
they would be defeated should they dare
to start war did not hold true. It was the
ory that it would take them the whole
night to erect bridges, which we could
prevent, using our armored vehicles. But
it turned out that it was not easy to pre
vent them. Our exercise to send tanks to
the battle front was very costly. We have
never expected that. (Press Conference,
Oct. 9, 1973)

From Israeli newspapers: "Up to the
date of cease-fire on the Sinai front we
had not caused injury to the Egyptian
army. Definitely, even failing the cease
fire, we would not be able to stop or
destroy the Egyptian army. Thus, it can
be said that during our fourth war with
the Arabs, we have realized nothing."
(Haarts, Nov. 18, 1973)
On top of that, on Nov. 18, 1973, the
Israeli Government issued a decree estab
lishing the Agranat Committee chaired
by the Head of the Supreme Court, Dr.
Shimon Agranat. This committee was a
legal investigation committee, set up
under the law on investigation commit
tees.
The committee held the head and
assistant head of Military Intelligence Ser
vice liable for the gross miscalculation of
the situation on the eve of the war and
the first day of war operations. Both com
manders failed to give adequate warning
to the Israeli army, leading to tremen
dous confusions in the preparedness of
troops along the fronts and their deploy
ment over the Suez Canal front.
Premier Golda Meir resigned after the
release of the partial, interim report of
the committee in April 1974.
As for Axel rod's comments regarding
threats from Egypt to Israel, I wonder if
he knows that Egypt's President Sadat in
1971 called for peace in exchange of the
occupied land. The United States sup

ported his call but the official Israeli
response was accepting the peace offer
but refusing to give back any of the occu
pied Egyptian lands and threatening the
Egyptians if they even tried to free it.
Thus Egypt clearly declared that the only
way to retrieve our lands back was
through war. Thus we did not cowardly
start the war; the Israelis knew all long
that we would not leave it to them. Let me
quote some other Israeli opinions:
Maim I lertzog, Former Head of the
State of Israel said that, "Before Oct. 0,
we used to talk too much, this was one of
our problems. While the Egyptians
learned how to fight, we learned how to
talk. They were patient and their state
ments were more realistic than ours.
They were telling and announcing facts
so fully that the external world seemed to
trust their statements. (Comments by
I lertzog, Nov., 1973)
()ne newspaper reported that; "Before"
i lie October War, the country was per
vaded by wrong feelings; the feeling of
our hawks of overwhelming military
supremacy. Such conviction has led them
into a military reassurance purporting
that: 'We'll cut them into pieces, should

iliey dare to snap a linger at us." (Al
Haniishmar, Israeli Newspaper, Od. 29,
1973)
Now, I will just add one more thing:
Israel through the help of the L'nitcd
States regained a lot of its power and even
acquired a big nuclear arsenal (estimated
In Western experts to be more than 200
nuclear war heads). It refuses to sign the
non-proliferation treaty: the same treaty
that the United States is putting pressure
on India and Pakistan to sign. It is impor
tant to note that the Arab countries
signed the treaty and have been calling
Israel to sign it for years and to make the
Middle East a nuclear weapon tree /.one.
Now I ask The Daily's readers to once
more think: Who is manipulating the
facts?

who provide services to students such as
checking I diversity mail through their
Web site. They claim that the service is
safe since they do not store student pass
words. There are, however, inherent

delects in the system.
Campusl uses the hit protocol which
makes the data vulnerable to interception
and observation by a third party during
transit. This amounts to a compromise
with the security of students' login and
passwords which demands utmost con
tern because not only are they used tor e
mail but also for all online transactions
with the I'niversity including financial,
administrative and academic matters.
It is noteworthy that the University
system uses kerberos login or https pro
tocol which adequately encrypt the data
to ensure their security. When e-mail is
accessed through external services such
as Campusl, it is without any SSL (secure
socket layer) and that too without a warn
ing. My mail to the support group at
Campus I seeking explination for the lack
of security features yielded no response.
We had contacted the University Net
work Security Administration regarding
I his issue and were told that non-kerberos
external logins (such as the one used by
Campusl) will not be able to enter into
the University Network. This is exepect-
implemented by the fall 2000
Climber. Besides, the University is coming
up with an e-mail access through a Web
system of its own.
Since a large number of students will
be off-campus during the summer, they
might be tempted to access e-mail

through the increasingly popularized
Web-based Campusl, which apparently
looks easier than configuring a Kerberos
logon. 1 believe that the publication of
this letter in The Daily will help spread
awareness among students that by using
external services, they are putting their
passwords at risk and may become victims
of hacking.
