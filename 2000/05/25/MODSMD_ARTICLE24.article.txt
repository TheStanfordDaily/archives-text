# Confessions, conspiracy theories... and the 'Administration'
## 
### PETER DOUGLAS GUEST COLUMNIST 
I realized this weekend, as I began
writing this column, that there
exists a long and respectable tradi
tion of writers closing works or
series with confessional/revelatory state
ments, and since this is my last column —
at least for this quarter — 1 thought I
might take this opportunity to impart a
few foul things I've learned about this
I niversity during my three years here.
Of course, I still have another year, so
I am not yet unfettered by the burden of
personal necessity and cannot spill the
beans entirely. That is, there are certain
topics about which, for fear of retaliation
from certain members of the Administra
tion, I must hold back on both what I
know and what I intuit. I don't consider
this cowardice but prudence and consid
eration, for I would only bring down indi
viduals who can't help their stupidity or
cruelty — aspects of themselves that are
not entirely intentional, but one could
say, lie in the specific shades of their spir-

itual moments. For the
time being, I will con
fine myself to ilie gen
eral policies and deci
sions that are being exe
cuted and the repercus
sions they have for
Stanford.
Greeks, parties and
the "Administration."

In the past half decade, the Administration
has de-housed no less than four fraterni
ties (Deke, Delt, Phi Delt and Taxi). In the
Phi Delt case, the Administration had a
pretty good argument. Otherwise, the
Administration's actions come down to
three motivations: personal ego malice; an
ignorant belief that fraternities are the key
perpetrators of underage binge drinking
on campus; and a desire to acquire total
control over all University properties.
The personal ego malice I cannot sup
port in fact, so I won't name individuals,
but let's just say that friends and I have
received abundant sneers from Adminis
trators who had personal stakes in seeing
our fraternities unhoused. As far as the

alcohol thing is concerned, we all know
that at hat parties, if you're lucky, you
be able to break through the pack
and get a cup or two of Natty Lite, and
that the most serious, organized drinking
usually occurs at dorm progressives,
where most of the alcohol is hard liquor,
and where the RFs seem to have a pen
diant for turning their backs. 1 would
venture to guess that the Administration,
In clamping down 011 fraternity parties,
lias actually increased the amount of
hard-core drinking 011 campus. (I'he
Administration's collective IQ is rather
low — 011. there are bright individuals,
but their effect 011 the mean IQ is mini
mal.) And the desire to have total control
over all University properties — well let's
just face it.in Silicon Valley it makes eco
nomic sense to assert your ownership
over as much land as possible.
Big Game Bonfire. The Administra
tion doesn't give a damn about the Tiger
Salamander. They simply wanted to push
through the Sand Hill Road Project, so
they figured they could throw the envi
ronmentalist groups the proverbial Lake

bone and appease them enough to
get what they really wanted. It worked.
But the fact is that there is copious evi
dence to suggest that the Big Game Bon
fire actually had almost no impact at all
on the tiger salamander — the reports
are available for anyone who cares to
look. So, if you think it'd be cool to have
a huge friggin' bonfire before Big Game,
all you have to do is throw the Adminis
tration a bone, like alumni or parental
donations — that's all that really matters
to the Administration as an abstract. It'll
work.
Coterms and cash. Several professors
in different departments, and one or two
administrators, have informed me that
coterms exist almost entirely to subsidize
departmental budgets. For example, the
Administration "may" say to a depart
ment, "You either increase your depart
mental revenue from students or you lose
a professorship." In response, a depart
ment "may" add a coterm program that
would be very attractive to unclergrads,
lack most of the substance of an ordinary
master's program, but bring in an addi

tional year of tuition that is then consid
ered part of that department's financial
value to the school.
Also, certain departments "may" be
willing to bargain with students regard
ing units and dollars. So if I had wanted
to coterm, had finished all the require
ments for it, but had only taken 180 units,
1 "might" still he able to graduate without
actually doing the fifth year; instead, 1
"might" be able to cut the Administration
a check for 45 units of tuition, and they
"might" just then switch the Bin my B.A.
to an M. Fantastically sordid, isn't it?
(Apparently the ability to do this depends
on the individual department, and they
don't like to publicize it a lot, so keep it on
the DL, yeah?)
Well, that's all — I don't have room for
any more. I hope knowing these things
helps you have a better life at Stanford.
