# URO funds 164 student researchers with grants to pursue unusual opportunities
## 
### TOMOKO SAKAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Friday, a long-awaited e-mail was sent to
104 winners of the Undergraduate Research
Opportunities major grant.
"I'm totally excited about it," said Jane
Kenny, a junior majoring in history with a focus
on Africa. "I'm planning to go to Kenya and
study the evolution of the relationship between
the church and the state."
Major grant winners are awarded a maxi
mum amount of $2,500 for research over three
quarters. U RO also offers minor grants for one
quarter of*research for up to $500.
This year, a total of 104 grants were ap
proved out of 270 applications submitted. Of*
the 164, 1 17 are funded directly by URO, while
the remaining 47 are funded by the Howard
Hughes Medical Institute through the Biology
Department.
"The actual number of applicants dropped
this year compared to last year," said I .aura
Selznick, URO director.
"I think this owes to the increase in the num
ber of summer undergraduate fellowships
being offered by individual departments
through the [office of the] vice provost for un
dergraduate education," Selznick added.
"Departments like electrical engineering,
mechanical engineering, physics, biology, eco
nomics and linguistics offer this fellowship, and
it funds students who are helping professors in
their research," she said.
In addition, each year a substantial number
of applications are placed on hold because the
applicants aren't thorough enough in explain
ing the process or feasibility of their research.
"Students awarded a major grant are almost
always assumed to do an honors thesis on it,"
Selznick said.
Unlike a minor grant, major grant applica
tions are revised through one or more faculty
departments and rated and ranked according

to their qualities and feasibility. The final deci
sion is confirmed by URO after consulting with
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education
John bravman.
"Students are always doing amazing stuff,
and asking which ones are most impressionable
or outstanding is like asking a parent which
child is their favorite," Selznick said.
Indeed, some students have inspiring tales
about why they applied and how they are going
to use their major grants.
"I'm planning to go study ancient earth
quakes in Latin America starting this summer,"
said junior bernabe Garcia.
"I'm travelling to Peru, Mexico, Guatemala,
Honduras and a few more Latin American
countries to look for signs of earthquake dam
ages in pyramids," he said.
Garcia said his inspiration and motivation
came from an Introductory Seminar he took
called "Earthquakes in America" taught by Geo
physics Prof. Robert Kovach.
"()ur class traveled to Gancun during spring
break and it was just an incredible experience
for me. Until then, I'd been pretty sure [I
would] major in Psychology, but that class
( hanged my mind to a American Studies
and Spanish major," Garcia said.
Garcia said he did not have too much diffi
culty with the application process.
"The URO Web site had examples of appli
cations and I basically followed that format. It
was clear and very useful. I bad to revise and re
submit my application, but I'm really glad I got
it,"he said.
"Now I'm getting busy making reservations
and contacts to the places I'll be going. A lot of
work to do, but my wife, my son who is 13 and
my daughter who is 11 are all very excited for
me. I'm looking forward to it."
