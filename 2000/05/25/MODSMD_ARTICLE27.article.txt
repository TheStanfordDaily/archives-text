In recognition of their out
standing contributions to public
and community service, five stu
dent groups and 41 students were
presented with special awards at a
banquet in Tresidder last night.
Dean of Students Marc Wais
honored the student groups with
Dean's Achievement Awards, and
presented the students with James
W. Lyons Awards, telling the re
cipients, "This is the University's
way of saying thank you to all stu
dents for all the work you do in en
riching people's lives."
Wais said that the large number
and variety of students and groups
recognized at the event were a re
flection of the "great diversity" of
Stanford.
" There are a lot of different
venues for students to engage
Stanford in the acts of service," lie
said.
Indeed, the student groups
honored with Dean's Achieve
ment Awards were a diverse
group: the Black Student Union,
the HIV Anonymous Test Peer
Counselors, the Stanford Environ
mental l-aw Society, the Stanford
Ethiopian Student Union, and
Stanford Tae Kwon Do Club.
University President Oerhard
Casper was unable to attend the
event, but sent his appreciation of

(he honorees' efforts via his assis
tant, Jacqueline Wender.
Wender cited a quote by for
mer I Diversity President Richard
Lyman describing the combina
tion of enthusiasm and compe
tence that is essential to success.
"You embody both enthusiasm
and competence, and the Univer
sity and surrounding communi
ties are the better for it," VVender
t<)ld the recipients.
Eighteen individual students
were presented with Lyons
Awards, along with two pairs of
students, a group of eight repre
senting the Unity 2000 coalition,
and the 11-member Women's
Center staff .
Lyons, a former Stanford Dean
of Student Affairs, was on hand at
the event to congratulate the hon
oiees and explain the history be
hind the awards.
"Stanford is a . . . place where
everybody pitches in for the com
mon good. The awards began in
1982 to celebrate the diversity of
reaching out and helping each
other that we take for granted
here," Lyons said.
Sophomore Ashwini Sagar, one
of the Lyons Award recipients for
the Women's Center, said, "It's re
ally exciting to know that Stanford
supports students in all their en
deavors, whether it be through ac
tivism, volunteer service or com
munity outreach."
