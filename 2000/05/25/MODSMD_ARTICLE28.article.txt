## Muth leads baseball on field as Cardinal aims for Omaha 
### TIM KANE STAFF WRITER 
For Stanford baseball fans, it sometimes seems like Ed
mund Muth has been around forever.
The senior has been a rock on the field, typically good
for at least a .300 average and a bunch of RBIs. His defense
in center field robs would-be extra-base hits away from op
ponents.
Now that the season, and his career, is coming to a close,
the senior outfielder is looking forward to returning to the
place that makes eveiything worth it, back in Omaha in the
beginning of June.
i"The College World Series is unbelievable — you can
barely put it into words. It makes everything and anything
worthwhile once you get there," Muth said.
• Against Fresno State this Friday, Muth and the Cardi
nal look to start back down on the path leading to that
place, while the rest of us marvel at the path Muth, in par
ticular, took to get to the Farm and to Sunken Diamond.
Muth came into baseball a litde later then most kids,
starting in Little League at age nine and playing practical
ly every position on the diamond, starting with catcher,
then moving to pitcher and also center field.
Once in high schtxjl at St. John Bosco in Long Beach,
Calif., though, Muth exploded under the guidance of
coach Casey Morales. "He told me not to waste an at
bat, to leave at the end of the day knowing I didn't get
cheated," Muth said.
The advice apparently worked, as Muth was named
rookie of the year before winning two team most valuable

player awards and the Del Rey league MVP his senior
year.
Muth managed to accomplish all this while dominating
in the classroom as well, winning a whopping 16 individ
ual academic awards at St. John Bosco while graduating
with a 4.15 CPA.
Given his hard work in the classroom, a certain uni
versity in the Bay Area immediately got placed on
Muth's list of colleges once he graduated. Stanford,
though, had to deal with a litde competition before
they could land their man.
"My number one [college choice] was USC,"
Muth said. "I flip-flopped back between [USC] and
Stanford, and it came down to whoever called me
last was where I was going to go. In the end, Sum
ford just seemed like a better fit."
After arriving on the Farm for the 1997 season,
it didn't uike long for Muth to make an impact.
Taking advantage of an opportunity to stint in
mid-season, he responded with nine homerunsand
46 RBI to go with a .388 average, and was named to
the All-Pac-10 Southern Division first team. If asked
what he remembers most, though, Muth gives an an
swer without the slightest bit of hesitation or deliberation.
"I was a freshman, and 1 came in to pinch hit against
UCLA," Muth recalled. "Their reliever hadn't given up a
home run all year in Pac-10 play, and I just crushed one to
dead center over the batting eye. I went up to the plate ex
pecting to hit the ball hard, and I was able to do something
