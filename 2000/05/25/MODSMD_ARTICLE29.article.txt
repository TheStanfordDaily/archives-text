# Softball bids farewell to a fairy-tale season

That's all tblks.
;> The five-year old Stanford Softball
.program (45-18, 9-12 Pacific 10 Con
ference) closed out another unforget
table year this weekend in Ann Arbor,
, Mich.
And although the Cardinal didn't
-exactly finish on the positive note it in
v tended, it can boost a number of in
. credible feats and victories for the pro
gram on a whole.
"There are definitely a lot of high
• lights over the course of the year to look
• back on," said head coach John
Rittman. "Back in February, we went
. undefeated in our first tournament of
the season, won the
. Campbell / Courtier Classic, went un
defeated again in the Utah Tourna
. ment and then finished strong in our
• fourth straight tournament on the road
. in Georgia."
In addition, the Cardinal batded
against the toughest pitchers and offen
sive lineups in the country within the
Pac-10 and earned an outstanding
1 fourth-place finish.
"I remember last year in the Pac-10,
we just couldn't seem to win a game,"
, said sophomore center fielder and Pac
-10 Player of the Year Jessica Mendoza.
/'But, this year, especially at the begin
ning, everybody was hitting and our
team was just on fire."
"One of my favorite wins this year
was when we played Cal on our field. It
was one of those games that was so per

feet and went according to plan. ITie
Band came to cheer us on and it was
great, ooitskteringi [Cal] beat us in the
final conference game last year."
Stanford silenced other nationally
renowned and top-ranked programs,
such as Arizona, Fresno State and
UCLA, on their own turfs and swept a
weekend in Oregon to clinch its fourth
place position, just ahead of Arizona
State, and help secure its No. 1 seed in
postseason regional placements.
"We knew going into it that if we had
a good weekend and played well, we
could come out with a fourth-place fin
ish," said sophomore shortstop Robin
Walker. "We wound up getting a few
one-run victories and did just what we
had to do."
Of course, the same scenario wasn't
repeated last week in Michigan.
The heartbreak of dropping its first
two games of regional play last Thurs
day and Friday in avid pursuit of earn
ing a spot to this year's World Series is
indeed still fresh on the minds of the
team's 16 women.
"One minute you're out on the field
playing and the next, you're home and
your season's over," Mendoza said.
"We've all been hanging out a lot and
reminiscing. All you can do is think
about, 'What if I had gotten a better
jump off third and scored that time?' or
'If I just could have hit another home
run.'"
But, the fact that the roster is made
up of primarily freshman and sopho
mores, and only two seniors — catcher
Kellie Wiginton and Lauren Gellman

— leaving after graduation, offers some
comfort to the players who are already
plotting their revenge for next season.
"It's very disappointing," said fresh
man pitcher Dana Sorensen (22-9). "It
still hurts knowing we could have been
playing ihis weekend in Oklahoma.
But, we have a lot to kx>k forward to as
a team. All of us seven freshman gained
regional experience this year and are

ready to come out more aggressive and
determined next season after feeling
the disappointment of losing. I'm even
ready to start playing now and we just
finished."
Hut before the Cardinal can find it
self back where it left off this season, it
first lias some very big shoes to fill be-
