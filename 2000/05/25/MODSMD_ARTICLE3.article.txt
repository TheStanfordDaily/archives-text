Editors Note: Today's story is the latest
in our weekly series examining the is
sues ami conflicts that have shaped
Stanford's relationships with the local
communities. This week, we conclude
our series with a look at the upscale of
the businesses in the city of Palo Alto.

When Leland Stanford Sr. was
contemplating how to plan the
University, he envisioned the area
surrounding his new institution as
an inviting community where edu
cation reigned.
Timothy Hopkins, Leland
Stanford's associate and one of the
first members of the Board of
Trustees, bought land adjacent to
the University, laid out several
l|ome sites and named the area
University Park. In April 1894, the
area known as University Park be
came the incorporated City of Palo
Alto.
University Archivist Maggie
Kimball said, "The idea was for a
university town to basically house
and support the University."

Students, residents pose
challenges to local businesses

"Stanford University is clearly
the prime difference between Palo
Alto and its neighbors. As Palo Alto
grew to nurture the University
and its faculty and students, so the
University has sustained the town,
its intellectual fare, cul
ture, business and thrilling sports



DANIEL SINTON/The Stanford Daily
The Town & Country Village shopping center is one of the many locations in
Palo Alto where Stanford students shop. Not all businesses make students feel
welcome, however, a reflection of the varied clienteles they face.
