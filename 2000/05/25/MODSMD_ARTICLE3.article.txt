# Buying Power

### AMY L. KOVAC STAFF WRITER 
Editors Note: Today's story is the latest
in our weekly series examining the is
sues ami conflicts that have shaped
Stanford's relationships with the local
communities. This week, we conclude
our series with a look at the upscale of
the businesses in the city of Palo Alto.

When Leland Stanford Sr. was
contemplating how to plan the
University, he envisioned the area
surrounding his new institution as
an inviting community where edu
cation reigned.
Timothy Hopkins, Leland
Stanford's associate and one of the
first members of the Board of
Trustees, bought land adjacent to
the University, laid out several
l|ome sites and named the area
University Park. In April 1894, the
area known as University Park be
came the incorporated City of Palo
Alto.
University Archivist Maggie
Kimball said, "The idea was for a
university town to basically house
and support the University."

Students, residents pose
challenges to local businesses

"Stanford University is clearly
the prime difference between Palo
Alto and its neighbors. As Palo Alto
grew to nurture the University
and its faculty and students, so the
University has sustained the town,
its intellectual fare, cul
ture, business and thrilling sports

The Town & Country Village shopping center is one of the many locations in
Palo Alto where Stanford students shop. Not all businesses make students feel
welcome, however, a reflection of the varied clienteles they face.

and the Palo Alto Historical Associ
ation in "Palo Alto: A Centennial
History."
Since the founding of the city
and the University, the two entities
have been interconnected in sev
eral ways, including die sharing of
services such as the fire depart
ment and public schools. Four
Palo Alto schools — Palo Alto
High,Cunn High, Nixon Elemen
tary and Escondido Elementary —
are located on land provided by
Stanford.
In turn, Palo Alto provides
many Stanford students, faculty
and staff with services not found
on campus, such as automobile
service, dry cleaning, upscale
restaurants and retail stores selling
furniture, hardware and clothing.
Like the Stanford Shopping
Center, however, businesses in
downtown Palo Alto reflect the
wealth of Silicon Valley. Many stu
dents feel alienated by the affluent
shopping culture of downtown
Palo Alto.
Windi Blazyk, a master's stu
dent in Russian and East Euro
pean Studies, commented on a re
cent experience shopping in
downtown Palo Alto.
"Downtown Palo Alto is a great
place to see the stores I might one
day be able to afford shopping at,"
Blazyk said. "My roommate and I
were there today, and she said
Restoration Hardware is one of my
favorite stores! I can't wait to have
enough money to shop there! I am
definitely decorating my house by
shopping there.' My response of
course, was 'What house? We live in
a lousy apartment!'"
Restoration Hardware, selling
upscale furniture and home fix
tures, has been located in Palo Alto
for five years. Last year, the Palo

Alto store was No. 2 in sales out of
100 locations nationwide, accord
ing to Pattie Williams, the store's
associate manager.
"We have all kinds of clientele,"
Williams said. "We have several
customers from Stanford that buy
merchandise here." She estimated
that 20 to 25 percent of their pa
trons are from Stanford. "I think
that we do get students in here but
as tar as I know, the people who
are purchasing are mostly people
who work at Stanford," she said.
Senior Katherine Loo noted
that other factors besides high
prices keep her from shopping in
Palo Alto.
"The thing that deters me from
going to downtown Palo Alto
more often is the traffic and park
ing situation," Loo said. "It's not
very conducive to quick shopping
trips. I've never really gone there
for anything other than food."
Senior Randy Fish said, "/Ml I
ever do is eat at the restaurants. I
am always treated nicely there.
There are very few stores I ever go
to down there."
But some stores cater more to
students' needs and pocketbooks.
Mars Abtin, part owner of the pop
ular Palo Alto ice cream shop Gela
to Classico, said, "We've been in
this location for 15 years and we
have a lot of customers from the
University.
"We have given coupons to
Stanford students and staff. I
think that Stanford students and
faculty members enjoy it because
they come back again," Abtin
added.
Cole Bridges, marketing direc
tor for the Town and Country
Shopping Center on El Camino
Real, said that he believes his com
plex has a good relationship with
Stanford.
"We are serving a much
younger clientele than we did 20
years ago," said Bridges. "We're
very happy that Stanford is there.
It's a community which we value."
