# Lessons from what Kareem may have lost
## 
### 
When he was an undergraduate at
UCLA, my father shared a chemistry
class with Lew Alcindor. The man who
would be Kareem showed up on the
first day of the semester, my father recalls, grabbed a
syllabus and never came back.

The story has always amused
me, though the fact that, in college,
my dad never saw the NBA's great
est center play in person — the
ticket lines were too long, he says —
still stuns me. It's like spending two
years in Ghiradelli Square and not
once trying the ice cream.
Now, as I write my final sports
column after four years of Stan-

ford, Lew's part in the story begins to bug me, too.
1 started as a Daily sports editor in the fall of my
sophomore year with an enormous amount of en
thusiasm, excited to be shaping sports coverage at
the school with the best all-around athletics of any
college in the United States.
But the prospect of watching and writing about a
glut of winning teams wasn't the most exciting part
of editing. This was a chance to follow people who
excel on the court or in the field, many of whom I
knew and enjoyed being around.
"College is unique," I wrote in my first sports col
umn, "because athletes are still 'real' people who go
to class and hang out at parties. Spotlighting those
players is often the best way to gain insight on sports
that many students know little about."
I still believe that. Over the years, I've had the
privilege to interact with many of the athletes who
frequently grace the Daily sports pages. My CIV class
alone included two tight ends, a golfer, a gymnast, a
field hockey star, a tennis player who turned pro and
an outfielder who just made the All-Pacific- 10-Con
ference team in baseball.
My next-door neighbor in Alondra, who happens
to be an All-Conference softball selection as a senior,
used to bring me soup when I was sick. Sitting in a
plane stalled on a Birmningham, Ala., runway, a
probable first-round N BA draft pick and I passed the
time talking about our girlfriends.
Not that any of those experiences are rare at Stan
ford. Talented athletes, like talented scholars, just
meld into the crowd here. Sometimes, I think, we
take that for granted.
I don't idolize athletes, though I did grow up
wanting to play second base for the Dodgers. But I
really enjoy rooting for people I know and care
about, and that's why I'll miss college sports next
year.
It's also why I'm beginning to understand how my
dad could care so little about the greatest dynasty —


Jim Tmkirstiy
the Wooden-era I CLA men's bas
ketball teams — in American
sports history.
Lew Alcindor and Tom
Tankersley probablv wouldn't
have been friends even if the for
mer had bothered to show up for
chemistry on a regular basis.
But maybe if they'd interacted
on a daily basis, seen each other in
class, chatted once about a test,
whatever, mv father would have

cared about Lew's teams.
I get a lot of trap around the
Daily office for occasionally inject
ing a sort of sentimentality —
other editors call it cheese or sap
— into my columns, so I'll spare
you ihe teary good-bye.
Instead, I'll just say thanks, to
the athletes, writers and editors
I've encountered through Stan
lord and the Daily sports office in
the last four years.
It's been fun.

Senior .sports editor Jim Tankersley
will graduate in June with a degree in
political science.
