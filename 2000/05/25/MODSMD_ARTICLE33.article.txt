The godfather of "The Godfa
ther," esteemed filmmaker Francis
Ford Goppola, will relate his expe
riences in the entertainment in
dustry in his speech tonight at 8
p.m., sponsored by the ASSU
Speakers Bureau.
All tickets for the free event at
Gubberly Auditorium have already
been given out, but Speakers liu
reau Director Gheryl Galvin said
there is always a chance that some
ticket holders will not show up.
Galvin, a junior, emphasized that
Stanford is indeed very fortunate to
have the opportunity to hear Gop
pola speak, because he rarely does
speaking engagements.
"It took the prestige of Stan
ford, proper timing and luck to or
ganize this event," Galvin said.
Galvin apologized that the
Speakers Bureau was unable to
book Memorial Auditorium to ac
commodate a much larger audi
ence. She said that a Drama Depart
ment performance in Little Theater
would have been disturbed by a
speech in the auditorium, and Gub
berly was the only location available.
Goppola is renowned fin direct
ing such highly acclaimed films as

the three movies in"The Godfa
ther" series, "Apocalypse Now,"
" The Outsiders," "Brain Stoker's
Dracula," "Tucker: The Man and
I lis Dream" and"The Rainmaker."
"The Godfather" is still one of the
highest-grossing films of all time,
while "The Godfather II" made
movie history when it won six Acad
emy Awards, including Best Pic
ture. No sequel before or since has
ever garnered so much praise.
At age 10, Goppola was stricken
with polio. During his illness he
amused himself by putting on pup
pet shows and makingan Bmm film.
After graduating from U ClA's
film school, (loppola had to pay his
dues in Hollywood. His first work
was a soft-core pornographic film,
" Tonight for Sure" (1961), and he
also worked odd jobs on a quickie
horror flick for Roger Gorman,
"Dementia l.'V' (1963).
While directing "Finian's Rain
bow" (1968), Coppola befriended
USG film school student George
Lucas, who was observing the pro
duction on a scholarship from
Warner Brothers Studios.
In 1969, Goppola and Lucas
opened their own production facili
ty. American Zoetrope in San Fran
cisco. 1 his company went bank
rupt, however, after Lucas made an

unpopular film, "THX-1138."
"The Godfather" series was cre
ated in the wake of this disaster
and helped to pull Goppola out of
debt and into the limelight.
Most of Coppola's films are
based on literature. "The Godfa
ther" was based on the Mario Puzo
novel, "Apocalypse Now" was
based on Joseph Conrad's "Heart
of Darkness" and"The Rainmak
er" was based on the John Gr
isham bestseller of the same name.
Coppola once said, "I find when
I do a novel, I don't really use the
script, I use the lxx>k ... I find that
novels usually have so much rich
material it's better to look through it
and base the film on that."
Much of Coppola's family has
become involved in the film indus
try as well. His father, Carmine,
wrote the scores for his movies,
while his younger sister, Talia
Shire, played the role of Connie
Corleone in"The Godfather." His
daughter, Sofia Coppola, recently
directed the critically-acclaimed
"The Virgin Suicides."
Also, actor Nicolas Cage is Cop
pola's nephew. He was billed as
Nicholas Coppola in a non-speak
ing part in 1982's "Fast Times at
Ridgemont High," liefore chang
ing his last name.
