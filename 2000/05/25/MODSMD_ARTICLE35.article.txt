I will never forget hearing, in the late Van
couver summer of 1997, Sleater-Kinney fbi the
first time. Although I'd read a glowing review
of the northwest trio's new album "Dig Me
Out" that drew passing comparisons to Sonic
Youth and Nirvana (which should probably
have been a clue), somehow those printed
words did not quite prepare me for the
startling intensity of their play ing.
Between the thunderous drumming of new
bandmate Janet Weiss, the searing, soaring
interplay of Carrie Brownstein's and Corin
Tucker's guitars, and the raw, breathless
urgency of fucker's singing, the three made
the new songs live with a kinetic passion .it once
furious, desperate and joyful.
On the heels of the previous year's water
shed album "Call the Doctor," the incandescent
"Dig Me Out." provoked a flood of attention
from mainstream and underground media
alike, as well as a burgeoning fan base. The
band, which was not long removed from play
ing record stores and community centers (and
on one occasion, KZSI' radio), found its new
situation a little overwhelming.
"I think the pressure was just coming from
within," Brownstein says."For the first time,
Sleater-Kinney had sort of been divided into
two different entities. I here was the Sleater-
Kinney that was me, (lorin, and Janet — three
people writing music — and there was the
Sleater-Kinney that existed outside of us — the
identity of the band as created by the media
[andj fans.
"When you come from an independent
community where you have a lot of close rela
tions with your fans, and you sort of rely on that
kind of immediacy and interaction, as you get
bigger, you still want that kind of interaction,
but it's really difficult because sometimes those
people are rejec ting you at the same time. So I

think you have to strike a balance between
wanting to make yourself accessible and want
ing to stay the same on all these levels, but also
realizing that you can't please everybody."
Rather than trying to make another "Dig Me
Out," the band explored new creative direc
tions in 1999's " lite Hot Rock," enlisting new
producer Roger Moutenot (of Yo La Ten go
fame) and writing more complex, introspective
songs. "It was a very cathartic record," says
Brownstein, "very much an interior land
scape."
"Start Together," the first track, opens amid
jangled, propulsive guitar riffs, with Tucker's
clarion call, "If you want me it's changing / II
vou want everything's changing" unleashing a
torrent of power chords as she continues, "II
\<>u want the skv would open up. . . I'm a mess
I'm the worst / But the best / that you've
heard." But the album also contained several
songs on a more personal, intimate level, like
the sweet-bitter "A Quarter to Three," an ellip
tic. il song revolving slowly in time, whose guitar
solo glistens with quiet longing.
In the time between "The Hot Rock" and
writing their latest album, says Brownstein,
came "the realization that Sleater-Kinney is
whoever we want it to be. . . no matter if any
one else likes it, or hates it, or whatever. That
was really freeing, that feeling, to realize that we
could do whatever we wanted."
Part of that freedom lies in with their contin
uing association with Olympia-based indie label
Kill Rock Stars, even as former labelmates Elliott
Smith and Mary Lou Lord have gone on to sign
with Dreamworks and Sony. "It's really impor
tant for me that I can make art that isn't seen as
a commodity to someone else — that isn't seen as
just something that someone can make money
oil of. and that when I can't make money for
them, then I can then be discarded, thrown out,
used," says Brownstein. "I mean, we are an
ambitious band, but I think I would rather push

the boundaries of w hat you can do on an inde
pendent label, and change il Irom that stand
point, than try to jump to a major label and try
to change anything. I think once you do that,
something has often been watered down.
There's definitely a few exceptions to that — like-
Built to Spill, Sonic Youth [which have gone to
major labels] without compromising a thing.
But I just don't want to take that risk."
The new album, "All Hands on the Bad
One," is a more brashly extroverted record
than " The Hot Rock," but similarly complex in
its textures and in the themes it explores, which
recall "Call the Doctor's" heated mix of the per
sonal and the political. A standout track is "#1
Must I lave," in which flicker casts a critical eye
on consunierist culture, and on herself for let
ting it dilute her activism ("And I think that I
sometimes might have wished / For something
more than to be a si/.e six"). The closing stretto
heightens fucker's impassioned call to arms:
"Culture is what we make it Yes it is/' Now is the
time / Now is the time / Now is the time / Fo
invent / Invent / Invent / Invent / Invehhh-eh
eh-ehhhhh-ent / Invent."
In the mid-'9o's, what was so compelling
about Sleater-Kinney was their rawness and
abandon, their commitment, their playing on
the edge of death. What's compelling about
them now is that they remain steadfast, contin
ue to grow musically, and are in it for the long
haul. Citing Yo La lengo as an example,
Brownstein says,"I think [they] make really
great music, and I really appreciate the longevi
ty of their band. 1 think it's much more inter
esting to watch a band change over time —
Fugazi as well — just bands that are interested
in evolving as creative entities, and not just
doing the same kind of music over and over
again. Those are the people that are really
inspiring to me."
Sleater-Kinney plays at the Fillmore in San
Francisco June 8.
