# 'Hearsay' full of comedy, sadness
## 
### CHRIS CROWELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the past three years, "Hearsay" has been charming audiences
with innovative experimental flair, wit, and sheer audacity in a
night of outdoor monologues and dialogues. This year's "Hearsay
2000" is no exception, but it does go deeper than it has in the past
with a series of depressing scenes interspersed throughout the
evening. Some of these sad vignettes work, some are clunkers, but
none keep this production from being an overall beguiling and win
ning evening of free theater. "Hearsay" is alive and well, and as
comically disturbing as ever.
Four directors are manning ship this year, and producer Megan

Mickley even stages two pieces.
Artistic Director Jenn Chou (and
proud creator of the "Hearsay"
tradition) has a tremendous sense
of comic timing. Chou directs Rita
Garg as a frenetic airline stew
ardess who's expecting a baby.
