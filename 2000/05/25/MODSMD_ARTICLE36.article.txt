# 'Hearsay' full of comedy, sadness
## 
### CHRIS CROWELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the past three years, "Hearsay" has been charming audiences
with innovative experimental flair, wit, and sheer audacity in a
night of outdoor monologues and dialogues. This year's "Hearsay
2000" is no exception, but it does go deeper than it has in the past
with a series of depressing scenes interspersed throughout the
evening. Some of these sad vignettes work, some are clunkers, but
none keep this production from being an overall beguiling and win
ning evening of free theater. "Hearsay" is alive and well, and as
comically disturbing as ever.
Four directors are manning ship this year, and producer Megan

Mickley even stages two pieces.
Artistic Director Jenn Chou (and
proud creator of the "Hearsay"
tradition) has a tremendous sense
of comic timing. Chou directs Rita
Garg as a frenetic airline stew
ardess who's expecting a baby.

Stanford's third annual short scenes festival fulfills the expectation built up
in past years with comic and tragic dialogues.
And in one of the
show stoppers of
the night, she
directs Sara Net!,
kirstin Quade,

and liyssa Silverman in an absolutely phenomenal
adaptation of Cynthia Heimel's "Sex l ips for Girls."
Roxy Sass, eat your heart out. These girls know sex,
and it's a true pleasure to watch them strutting their
stuff.
Jason Mendelson, coming off from a fine job as
producer for Ram's Head's "Pippin," directs Colin
Drake as a Business School student unimpressed by
college theater. And he has concocted a series of
clever scene transitions with the illustrious Rebecca
Whitehurst and the talented Zack Kinney kissing sev
eral times through different stages in their relation
ship. The cute and spunky Mattie Johnstone is also a
treat as a deranged girl whose psychiatrist just died.
But Rebecca Hanover (great name for a director, 1
might add) is the true directing goddess of the
evening. She handles Christopher
Durang's "Beyond Therapy" with a true stroke of
genius. In it, Zach L'dko plays a wonderfully psy
chotic blind date to Maggie Siska's flustered hopeful.
Hanover also tackles "1 he Search for Signs of Intelli
gent Life" with a flat-out fantastic Mandy Khosh
nevisian, and "Lives of' Great Waitresses" with a hard
ened, bitchy, and acerbic Risa Okamoto as a born
again waitress.
Jessica Donaghy brings the morbid and unfunny
scenes to the table, and while they might be fine on
their own, they really bog down the flow of the show.
There's also a silent monologue that may leave you
puzzled. It's not that it's bad, it's just odd.
On a separate note, Andrew Leeds has done a
wonderful job with his absolutely splendid poster
design. Every Stanford show should be lucky enough
to advertise with such stvle.
