# Student band has sights set on stardom
## 
### STEVEN RAPHAEL STAFF WRITER 
It's 3:30 on a sweltering Sunday afternoon. Although most of the
ads you saw said that the gates wouldn't open until 4:30, you show
up earl) for Frost Fest, the biggest on-campus concert of the year. As
soon as the gates are unlocked, you hear Stanford hand Scott Hay
and Company start playing.
Making youi way up the winding path into Frost Amphitheater,
you look down the rows of empty lawn seats to the stage where the
band is performing. Hanging atop the stage is a huge white sign
with black and red letters that reads, "Grinning Idiots," the name of
the first professional band to play later that day.
Looking out at the 50 or so people scattered throughout the
amphitheater, you realize that Scott could complain about the early
time- slot. Hut he doesn't. Flanked bv a classically trained violinist, a
jazz bass player, and an indie rock drummer, he just puts his all into
the music, giving as strong a performance as ever.
After all, even with the lousy time slot, this is still one of the
biggest shows of his short career. Ihe only time the band might
have seen a larger crowd was when they opened for Save Ferris in
Santa Clara.
Dressed in a button-down white shirt and army green shorts, the
blond lla\ sways back and forth with the music. He belts out lyrics
and melodic ally chants the syllable "Oh" in his strong baritone voice
which approximates Fddie Vedder in the low ranges and Robert
Plant in tlie higher ones.
Driven by the rhythmic pounding of the torn and bass drums,
there's a definite resemblance to Rusted Root in the group's music.
And although you hesitate to make the comparison since it seems so
superficial and obvious, there is a certain likeness to the Dave
Matthews Hand — even beyond the fact that both groups use a vio
lin. The similarity seems to be between the singers, since Hay doesn't
play guitar like Matthews, and since, unlike the Dave Matthews

Scott Hay & Co. are building a fan base on a solid foundation of songwriting and strong live shows, including last weekend's FrostFest.
Band's violinist, Hay's bandmate
actually knows how to play.
The songs benefit from the
musical expertise of each of the
members, incorporating tension
and release, changes, breaks,
accents and solos into Hay's
"really simple folk music." Hay
utilizes the whole neck of his
guitar in creating his strummed
rhythms. Meanwhile, the bass
actively moves beneath him and
the violin skillfully finds its niche
in the group, alternately dou
bling and counterpointing Hay's
vocal melody before bringing

the song to a climax with a pow
erful solo.
Onstage, the group doesn't
try too hard to entertain. They
let the music take care of that.
"We're just trying to go out
there and have a good time and
not take ourselves too seriously,"
Hay explains. They are musi
cians, plain and simple.
So, it came as a bit of a sur
prise to Hay when his group
started receiving so much atten
tion. "We're really an acoustic
band," he says."I mean, 1 think
we're really good, but just
because you like something
doesn't mean everyone else will."
For the last couple of years,
the band has been performing

around the Stanford and Santa
Clara University campuses.
After winning the Stanford Bat
tle of the Bands in March, they
began touring around Califor
nia, playing bars, clubs and par
ties, including the gig opening
for Save Ferris and Sunday's
performance at Frost Fest.
"None of us really expected to
have this whole thing happen,"
Hay says. "With all the work we
put in, it's just nic e to know that
people like the songs."
And people do like them. By
the time the band is finishing
their last song, nearly 200 peo
ple have filed into the amphithe
ater and every one of them is
cheering. With characteristic

charisma, Hay thanks the crowd
for coming and mentions which
bands will play later in the day.
There's something about that
combination of music and
charisma that seems to point to
future success. If you met Hay
on the street, he'd strike you as a
celebrity in the making. Riding
barefoot on his skateboard, his
ex-water polo player biceps
bulging out from his white
James Dean undershirt, some
thing about his self-assured
manner seems to single him out
as the lead singer of a band. It
doesn't take much imagination
to see his ever-present Cary
Busey smile and naturally
spiked blond hair on television.

For now, Hay is just trying to
get as mam people interested in
the group as possible. An
upcoming studio recording and
professionally made music video
will certainly help them move in
that direction. Set, ultiniatelv.
I lay expects that he will fall back
on his Stanford product design
education. "I don't know if I can
handle being a musician all m\
life. At some point, I want to
have a normal family life."
But, before that happens.
Scott I lav and (lompany is going
to make a lot of music and win a
lot of fans. Slowly, they're
expanding their tours to cover
more of the country, and slowly,
they're attracting more and more

notice.

Driven by the rhythmic pounding of the torn and bass drums,
there's a definite resemblance to Rusted Root in the group's music.
And although you hesitate to make the comparison since it seems so
superficial and obvious, there is a certain likeness to the Dave
Matthews Hand — even beyond the fact that both groups use a vio
lin. The similarity seems to be between the singers, since Hay doesn't
play guitar like Matthews, and since, unlike the Dave Matthews

Scott Hay & Co. are building a fan base on a solid foundation of songwriting and strong live shows, including last weekend's FrostFest.
Band's violinist, Hay's bandmate
actually knows how to play.
The songs benefit from the
musical expertise of each of the
members, incorporating tension
and release, changes, breaks,
accents and solos into Hay's
"really simple folk music." Hay
utilizes the whole neck of his
guitar in creating his strummed
rhythms. Meanwhile, the bass
actively moves beneath him and
the violin skillfully finds its niche
in the group, alternately dou
bling and counterpointing Hay's
vocal melody before bringing

the song to a climax with a pow
erful solo.
Onstage, the group doesn't
try too hard to entertain. They
let the music take care of that.
"We're just trying to go out
there and have a good time and
not take ourselves too seriously,"
Hay explains. They are musi
cians, plain and simple.
So, it came as a bit of a sur
prise to Hay when his group
started receiving so much atten
tion. "We're really an acoustic
band," he says."I mean, 1 think
we're really good, but just
because you like something
doesn't mean everyone else will."
For the last couple of years,
the band has been performing

around the Stanford and Santa
Clara University campuses.
After winning the Stanford Bat
tle of the Bands in March, they
began touring around Califor
nia, playing bars, clubs and par
ties, including the gig opening
for Save Ferris and Sunday's
performance at Frost Fest.
"None of us really expected to
have this whole thing happen,"
Hay says. "With all the work we
put in, it's just nic e to know that
people like the songs."
And people do like them. By
the time the band is finishing
their last song, nearly 200 peo
ple have filed into the amphithe
ater and every one of them is
cheering. With characteristic

charisma, Hay thanks the crowd
for coming and mentions which
bands will play later in the day.
There's something about that
combination of music and
charisma that seems to point to
future success. If you met Hay
on the street, he'd strike you as a
celebrity in the making. Riding
barefoot on his skateboard, his
ex-water polo player biceps
bulging out from his white
James Dean undershirt, some
thing about his self-assured
manner seems to single him out
as the lead singer of a band. It
doesn't take much imagination
to see his ever-present Cary
Busey smile and naturally
spiked blond hair on television.

For now, Hay is just trying to
get as mam people interested in
the group as possible. An
upcoming studio recording and
professionally made music video
will certainly help them move in
that direction. Set, ultiniatelv.
I lay expects that he will fall back
on his Stanford product design
education. "I don't know if I can
handle being a musician all m\
life. At some point, I want to
have a normal family life."
But, before that happens.
Scott I lav and (lompany is going
to make a lot of music and win a
lot of fans. Slowly, they're
expanding their tours to cover
more of the country, and slowly,
they're attracting more and more

notice.

Hay climbs on the back of a
motorbike and, with a wave of
the w bite co\vbo\ hat that lie's
donned, disappears up the road
behind the stage. Meanwhile,
the (binning Idiots are plaving
and people are steadily filing in.
B\ the time the headliners lake
