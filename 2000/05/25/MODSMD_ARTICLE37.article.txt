# Student band has sights set on stardom

### STEVEN RAPHAEL STAFF WRITER 
It's 3:30 on a sweltering Sunday afternoon. Although most of the
ads you saw said that the gates wouldn't open until 4:30, you show
up earl) for Frost Fest, the biggest on-campus concert of the year. As
soon as the gates are unlocked, you hear Stanford hand Scott Hay
and Company start playing.
Making youi way up the winding path into Frost Amphitheater,
you look down the rows of empty lawn seats to the stage where the
band is performing. Hanging atop the stage is a huge white sign
with black and red letters that reads, "Grinning Idiots," the name of
the first professional band to play later that day.
Looking out at the 50 or so people scattered throughout the
amphitheater, you realize that Scott could complain about the early
time- slot. Hut he doesn't. Flanked bv a classically trained violinist, a
jazz bass player, and an indie rock drummer, he just puts his all into
the music, giving as strong a performance as ever.
After all, even with the lousy time slot, this is still one of the
biggest shows of his short career. Ihe only time the band might
have seen a larger crowd was when they opened for Save Ferris in
Santa Clara.
Dressed in a button-down white shirt and army green shorts, the
blond lla\ sways back and forth with the music. He belts out lyrics
and melodic ally chants the syllable "Oh" in his strong baritone voice
which approximates Fddie Vedder in the low ranges and Robert
Plant in tlie higher ones.
Driven by the rhythmic pounding of the torn and bass drums,
there's a definite resemblance to Rusted Root in the group's music.
And although you hesitate to make the comparison since it seems so
superficial and obvious, there is a certain likeness to the Dave
Matthews Hand â€” even beyond the fact that both groups use a vio
lin. The similarity seems to be between the singers, since Hay doesn't
play guitar like Matthews, and since, unlike the Dave Matthews
