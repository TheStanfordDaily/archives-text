# From a jazz hero, even a decent album can disappoint
## 
### STEVEN RAPHAEL STAFF WRITER 
('.harlie Hunter is a musical hero of mine. The man
is one of (he most talented and revolutionary musicians
of all time. In addition to creating a new instrument
and possessing skill beyond all imagination, through
out his career he has made album after album defined
not only by his impressive playing, but also by the top
quality musicians whom he chooses to play with and
the unique spin that he brings to jazz music.
Which is why, when I learned that he had a new
album coming out, 1 jumped at the opportunity to
hear an advance copy of it. It arrived in the mail a cou
ple days alter I requested it, packaged in an inconspic
uous white padded envelope. I instantly tore the enve
lope open and, finding the self-titled album hidden
behind a green and black blurred album cover photo,
1 turned on my stereo and prepared myself for
I lunter's latest masterpiece.
As I was listening to the album, 1 kept waiting lot
the greatness to kick in. With a musician like Charlie
Ilunter, there's really no threat ofa bad album, perse,
(with the possible exception of 1998's "Return of the
Candyman," which I never have been able to under
stand), but what I found was that the new album was
just not at the same level as 1 had come to expect from
I lunter.
First of all, the album features drummer Leon Park
er, a couple of his students, sax player Peter Apfel
baum, and trombonist josh Roseman. But, there's no
consistent band throughout the album. ()ne song finds
Hunter playing solo, while another finds him accom
panied In both horns and all three percussionists. The
result is that the album lacks the cohesiveness typically
found in 1 lunter's work.
Furthermore, I've just never been a big Leon Park
er fan. Hunter had been touring with percussionist
Adam Cruz, who is one of the finest drummers I've
had the pleasure to observe in action. Cruz plays like a
madman, a huge abstract grin on bis face while all four
of his limbs are playing different rhythms. I le also dou
bles on steel drum (yes, while still playing drum set
with his other three limbs).
It's true, Leon Parker is no slouch. He's probably
one of the better drummers around today (though he
doesn't hold a candle to Bay Area drummer Scott
Amendola, who played with Hunter until his reloca
tion to New York in 1999). But, understand, Parker is
certainly no Adam C Iruz — not even when joined by all
of his students. Parker's beats tend to be much more
simplistic and repetitive, often returning to the same
pattern for long stretches at a time.
Aside from that, on this recording, I lunter turns his
bass up, which serves to highlight the relative simplici
ty of the bass lines (of course, to give him due credit, he
is playing guitar at the same time on that 8-stringof his,
which markedly complicates any bass line — if you
don't believe me, try playing any bass line and impro
vising over it. I've been trying for years, and I still can't

do it). Especially during a song like "Cloud Splitter,"
which l>egins with and returns to an unaccompanied
bass line composed mainly of four notes, I wondered
why he would want to draw attention to the bass.
Furthermore, the songs seem more abstract, often
lacking a clearly defined development. At other times,
while accompanying a soloist, I lunter seems to repeat
the same patterns over and over.
But with a musician like Charlie I lunter, you know
that almost nothing happens by accident. I here is gen
erally some theme that puts the entire album in per
spective. So, I thought I'd give of Charlie a call to see
what he had to say about the album. Maybe he could
help me gain some insight.
"To me, [this album] is kind of the Duo concept
[Hunter's last album featured him in a duo setting with
Parker], but filled out with horns and extra percus
sion," Hunter explained. True enough, excepting the
solo guitar number, the one consistency throughout
the album is the band of Charlie Hunter and Leon
Parker, with some guests.
So what happened to Adam (Iruz? "I le just wanted
to do his own thing," Hunter said. Apparently, while
Hunter has raved about New York and the opportu
nities it affords him to play with great musicians, the
downside is that each of those musicians also has his
own project to work on. Consequently, it's much hard
er to keep a solid band together.
But, what about the bass, Charlie? "I got a better
instrument with a lot deeper bass capabilities," he said.
"And, you know, 1 just wanted to pump the bass!"
With that in mind, I went back to re-evaluate the
album. Would it hold together if I thought of it as a
band with guests? What about the bass — just how bad
is it?
Well, in all fairness, I must sav that the album is in
fact pretty good. But, 1 stand by all of my original
judgements except for one: the album does feel more
cohesive when thought of as Hunter and Parker, plus
guests.
The main problem for us long time I lunter lans is
that of Charlie just doesn't seem to be breaking new
ground with "Charlie Hunter." Maybe we've gotten
spoiled, as he's always come through with a radically
new approach each album. Yet, on this album, two
songs have been recorded before, and at least two oth
ers sound remarkably similar to previous recordings.
Or maybe the problem is that his horn sec tion just
doesn't cut it (I've never been a big trombone fan any
how, and Apfelbaum only has one really exceptional
solo). Regardless, the bottom line is that Charlie
I lunter's album is pretty good — just not for a C lharlie
I lunter album.

It's true, Leon Parker is no slouch. He's probably
one of the better drummers around today (though he
doesn't hold a candle to Bay Area drummer Scott
Amendola, who played with Hunter until his reloca
tion to New York in 1999). But, understand, Parker is
certainly no Adam C Iruz — not even when joined by all
of his students. Parker's beats tend to be much more
simplistic and repetitive, often returning to the same
pattern for long stretches at a time.
Aside from that, on this recording, I lunter turns his
bass up, which serves to highlight the relative simplici
ty of the bass lines (of course, to give him due credit, he
is playing guitar at the same time on that 8-stringof his,
which markedly complicates any bass line — if you
don't believe me, try playing any bass line and impro
vising over it. I've been trying for years, and I still can't

do it). Especially during a song like "Cloud Splitter,"
which l>egins with and returns to an unaccompanied
bass line composed mainly of four notes, I wondered
why he would want to draw attention to the bass.
Furthermore, the songs seem more abstract, often
lacking a clearly defined development. At other times,
while accompanying a soloist, I lunter seems to repeat
the same patterns over and over.
But with a musician like Charlie I lunter, you know
that almost nothing happens by accident. I here is gen
erally some theme that puts the entire album in per
spective. So, I thought I'd give of Charlie a call to see
what he had to say about the album. Maybe he could
help me gain some insight.
"To me, [this album] is kind of the Duo concept
[Hunter's last album featured him in a duo setting with
Parker], but filled out with horns and extra percus
sion," Hunter explained. True enough, excepting the
solo guitar number, the one consistency throughout
the album is the band of Charlie Hunter and Leon
Parker, with some guests.
So what happened to Adam (Iruz? "I le just wanted
to do his own thing," Hunter said. Apparently, while
Hunter has raved about New York and the opportu
nities it affords him to play with great musicians, the
downside is that each of those musicians also has his
own project to work on. Consequently, it's much hard
er to keep a solid band together.
But, what about the bass, Charlie? "I got a better
instrument with a lot deeper bass capabilities," he said.
"And, you know, 1 just wanted to pump the bass!"
With that in mind, I went back to re-evaluate the
album. Would it hold together if I thought of it as a
band with guests? What about the bass — just how bad
is it?
Well, in all fairness, I must sav that the album is in
fact pretty good. But, 1 stand by all of my original
judgements except for one: the album does feel more
cohesive when thought of as Hunter and Parker, plus
guests.
The main problem for us long time I lunter lans is
that of Charlie just doesn't seem to be breaking new
ground with "Charlie Hunter." Maybe we've gotten
spoiled, as he's always come through with a radically
new approach each album. Yet, on this album, two
songs have been recorded before, and at least two oth
ers sound remarkably similar to previous recordings.
Or maybe the problem is that his horn sec tion just
doesn't cut it (I've never been a big trombone fan any
how, and Apfelbaum only has one really exceptional
solo). Regardless, the bottom line is that Charlie
I lunter's album is pretty good — just not for a C lharlie
I lunter album.

Jazz guitarist Charlie Hunter's reputation as a revolutionary musician and jazz innovator can sometimes build fans'
expectations up too high — his latest album being an example of a good record that still disappoints.
