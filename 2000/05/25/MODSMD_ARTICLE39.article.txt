## Atkins very overrated 
### STEVEN RAPHAEL STAFF WRITER 
I think its sale to sa) thai I don't understand
the appeal of ('het Atkins. I lie gu\ is consid
ered such a legend among guitarists that \on
hear his name used as an adjective, as in"I like
to pla\ diet Atkins stvle."
I his dest rihes the flat picking st\ le of plaving
popnlai i/erl h\ Aikins. a hvhricl between c lassi
cal fingei pic king and conntr\ banjo pic king.
Yet, on "Cliel Atkins: Guitai Legend, there
seems to be nothing patticulaiK inierestitig
about Atkins* music ih.it would elevate him i<>
adjective status. Some <>l his solo pieces when
he siinultaneoush pla\s a rhxthin and lead pari
are indeed impressive; vet, modern musicians
such as luck \nchcss. |oe Pass. and Charlie
lluntei have taken this conccpt so niucb lai
thei tli.it Atkins work no longei seems excep

furthermore, the songs Icatuiing othei

I lie improvisations played on top of this are

(|ucutl\. Guitai Legend, while certainly not
bad. is nothing special either.
