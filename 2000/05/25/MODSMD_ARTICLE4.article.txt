## 
### BEN ALEXANDER-BLOCH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Freshman Jonathan Akchin
has resumed selling James
Bond-themed freshman class T
shirts, despite a controversy tall
quarter surrounding a lack of
racial diversity and negative pre
sentations of women depicted on
them.
However, Akchin, a member
of the ASSU Frosh Council,
c hanged the shirts to better rep
resent the diverse freshman class,
and has begun to sell them again,
reviving some of the original con
troversy.
He said there is much confu
sion over the shirts' design, as
people were unaware that he
had made the shirt's design more

politically correct than its prede
cessor.
Several days ago, Akchin e
mailed the freshman class adver
tising the shirts.
"Remember those James
Bond-esque, Class of 2003 t
shirts that everyone liked, but
were not [politically correct]
enough to bear the official name
of the ASSU or Freshman Coun
cil?? Well they are back for sale,"
Akchin wrote.
"This is not an official Fresh
man Class T-shirt. It isashirtpri
vately produced by select mem
bers of the class without the
knowledge or approval of the
Freshman Council. Enjoy this
semi-legal apparel before the bu
reaucracy cracks down," Akchin
concluded.
; The renewed marketing of the
shirts led some people to believe
that Akchin had not changed the
design.
Akchin later said, "My mistake in
the whole scenario was poor mar
keting ... [using] the allure of a
non-PC shirt to sell a representative
shirt."
; Akchin claimed that any portray
al of different races on rhe shirt was
bound to provoke some concerns.
"You really can't portray racial
features without them being stereo
types. We did the best we could."
After the first e-mail, freshman
Ming Shin Wong responded in an
e-mail, "Yet another case of racism
and conservatism selling themselves
as a radical attack on the bureaucra
cy. Yuck. Don't buy the T-shirts,
and tell your friend not to either."
Ming later rescinded his state
ment after realizing that the shirts
h<id l>een changed, also saying that
he had not meant that Akchin was a
racist.
Even before Akchin changed the
T-shirts, the issue of the shirt's art
was a volatile one.
In an e-mail, freshman Danielle
Dixon clarified what some students
found wrong with the T-shirts'
original design.
"The James Bond T-shirts were
not disapproved for no reason,

neither were they vetoed as a show
of 'Bureaucratic Power,' " Dixon
said.
"When some [Class 0f2003] stu
dents saw the shirt, we were disap
pointed that none of the [freshmen]
on it were people of color (blacks,
Ixitinos, etc.). We felt this was an
unfair and untrue portrayal of the
Sum ford ('.lass of 2003. Notice: this
is not an all-encompassing state
ment of how all students of color
felt. However, some of us felt as
though the shirt excluded us,"
Dixon wrote.
After hearing that Akchin had
changed the shirts, though, she had
no problem with him selling them
to the freshman class.
Many students voiced regret
when the original Bond design was
pulled for the shirt, as they ft-lt it
was more exciting than the design
that was eventually chosen.
"I thought that the response in
regards to the James Bond shirt was
an over reaction in the name of cul
tural sensitivity, which did not rec
ognize what I felt to Ik* the design's
benign nature," said Charlie
Sprenger, a Frosh Council repre
sentative who had seen the old
James Bond-themed shirt.
Dean of Students Marc Wais
commented on his interpretation of
Akchin's selling of the revised shirts.
"It is hard for me to comment
on it as I haven't seen it," said Dean
of Students Marc Wais. "But, al
though I recognize the freedom of
speech, it is my understanding that
as an elective group the council de
cided to switch gears, and if some

one decided to circumvent the
Frosh Council's decision then it is a
little hit disconcerting."
Sprenger explained that
Akchin has the riglit to sell the shirt
as "the 1-shirt's design was the
property of the designers, not
Frosh Council."
Freshman Anna-Christina Dou
glas and Deborah (losta, two of the
original designers of the James
Bond shirt, voiced regret that they
are not being recognized for the
new shirt Akchin is selling.
"Akchin totally disregarded our
part in the whole thing," Douglas
said, "lie has not acknowledged
our 'intellectual property' rights,"
she said.
"The [design] was so iniKx uous,
we would not have had any of these
problems with [it]," Douglas added.
Akchin said that Douglas never
brought her concerns up with him
and that if he had known that Dou
glas wished to be involved then he
would have asked her to join his
production.
" 1 lie creation of a new, all-inclu
sive Class of '03 T-shirt with the
same James Bond theme, has been
a goal of mine since the original de
sign came under such fire," said
Akchin. "I am somewhat hurt that
[people] would denounce my pro
ject before even viewing the design,
but I am confident that it is a simple
misunderstanding of the nature of
the new T-shirt.
" I he figures on the back now re
lied the proud multicultural her
itage that our university cherishes
and strives to build and maintain."

to the freshman class.
Many students voiced regret
when the original Bond design was
pulled for the shirt, as they ft-lt it
was more exciting than the design
that was eventually chosen.
"I thought that the response in
regards to the James Bond shirt was
an over reaction in the name of cul
tural sensitivity, which did not rec
ognize what I felt to Ik* the design's
benign nature," said Charlie
Sprenger, a Frosh Council repre
sentative who had seen the old
James Bond-themed shirt.
Dean of Students Marc Wais
commented on his interpretation of
Akchin's selling of the revised shirts.
"It is hard for me to comment
on it as I haven't seen it," said Dean
of Students Marc Wais. "But, al
though I recognize the freedom of
speech, it is my understanding that
as an elective group the council de
cided to switch gears, and if some

one decided to circumvent the
Frosh Council's decision then it is a
little hit disconcerting."
Sprenger explained that
Akchin has the riglit to sell the shirt
as "the 1-shirt's design was the
property of the designers, not
Frosh Council."
Freshman Anna-Christina Dou
glas and Deborah (losta, two of the
original designers of the James
Bond shirt, voiced regret that they
are not being recognized for the
new shirt Akchin is selling.
"Akchin totally disregarded our
part in the whole thing," Douglas
said, "lie has not acknowledged
our 'intellectual property' rights,"
she said.
"The [design] was so iniKx uous,
we would not have had any of these
problems with [it]," Douglas added.
Akchin said that Douglas never
brought her concerns up with him
and that if he had known that Dou
glas wished to be involved then he
would have asked her to join his
production.
" 1 lie creation of a new, all-inclu
sive Class of '03 T-shirt with the
same James Bond theme, has been
a goal of mine since the original de
sign came under such fire," said
Akchin. "I am somewhat hurt that
[people] would denounce my pro
ject before even viewing the design,
but I am confident that it is a simple
misunderstanding of the nature of
the new T-shirt.
" I he figures on the back now re
lied the proud multicultural her
itage that our university cherishes
and strives to build and maintain."
