I lie problem with compiled ion
albums is that it's rare Ibi 011 c to be
good all the \va\ through. Due to the
nature of the albums, with diMcreut
artists recording on each s otig, 11 seems
almost inevitable that sonic songs will
be much better than otheis.
I his is the case with 'The 110
Chronicles," an album dedicated to a
highwax running through the heart ol
Amenta. I'd estimate that about ball

the album is reallv good. featuring both lop iiiusi
cians as well as rising siais. A track I >\ Willie Nelson
finds the countiA legend siill going siiong. while
another track featuring vocalist Adam Diirit/ proves
that Duritz is defining member <>l the Counting
Crows. Newcomers Bill llearne and ( heiokcc Rose
each contribute cat< h\ tracks to the album.
Yet, interspersed with iliese are songs that
demonstrate evcivthing that is despised about <01111-

boring, uninspired countn songs with annovingb
