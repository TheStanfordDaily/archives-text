Arthur's latest album. "Come to
Where I 111 from," < reates a
inoody and introspective land
scape from simple, guitar-based
melodies, hiking notes 110111
Leonard Cohen and Nick Cave,
Arthur's unpolished voice
explores the tangled web ol
heartache and despair, yet with
hope pervading every word.
"111 the Sun" (previously
recorded bv Pctei Cabriel in trib
ute to the late Princess Diana),
opens the album with gentle
acoustic guitar, while Arthur's
deep and scratch) voice c roons
low in the listener's ear. "Invisible
Mauds," where Arthur sounds
remarkably like I .eonarcl ( ohen, is
based more 011 mood than
melody, oddly interrupted In har
monica. "Chemical" is a c|uirkv,
Beck-like rock number where
lush, Beach Boy-like melodies
layer the chorus.
While the simple- guitar
melodies are a pleasant accompa
niment to Arthui s voice, too often
they sink into grating repetition.
"Creation or a Stain, ' the weakest
song of the album, sinks into
unpleasant 11 ess w ben Arthur
painfully attempts to rap while
accented by a meandering electric
guitar.
When I first heard this album, I
felt the samf reluctance to enjov it as

I did when I Ii Ist heard Dinosaur,
|r. But like |. Mascis's voice,
Arthur's brooding tunes began to
grow on me. I hough "Come to
Where fin I roin" is not likely to get
a listener dancing, this is a good
album for those loi lot 11 nights when
one just wants to sink into his own
delicious miseries.
