Few Christian singer/songwriters
have successfully made the crossover to
a mainstream audience — the rock
group Jars of Clay quickly comes to
mind, but their mainstream popularity
was relatively short-lived in the
extremely fickle popular music indus
try. Recently, Kirk Franklin's Nu
Nation found huge success with their
hip-hop hit, "Stomp," from the album
(iod's Property.
Despite its decidedly religious
theme, this was an immensely popular,
trowd-pleaser that got listeners jump
ing to their feet. Yet while religious
ground has been touched on by some
mainstream artists like Joan Osborne,
Tori Amos (albeit, in sacrilege), and
even Jewel, spirituality has rarely been
fully explored in explicit terms in mod
ern, popular music. Furthermore, it is
extremely rare to see a Christian singer
strike a chord in the mass audience
without compromising any of her
beliefs in speech or in action.
That's why it was shock to me when
1 heard the tunes from Jennifer
Knapp's sophomore release, "Fay it
Down." Sounding like a cross between
Sheryl Crow, Alanis Morissette and The

Indigo Girls, wearing
her heart and her
faith on her sleeve,
Rnapp is a rare gem
with her hard-hitting,
emotionally gripping,
and aurally pleasing
songwriting.
Some compare
knapp's folk-rock
and blues style to
Shawn Colvin, and
like Colvin, Knapp
found her fail base
increasing after per
formances with Sarah
McLachlan's Lilith
Fair. Kven though she
was incredibly open
about her religious
beliefs in both the

songs sin* sang and the testimonials slit
shared, Knapp found an intredibh
receptive audience. Once von lieai hei
music, it's no surprise what draws tlx
crowds in.
Whether slit's rocking with powei
