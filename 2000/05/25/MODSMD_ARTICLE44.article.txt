# Country ain't all bad

"Willie Nelson Style" hadn't been in m\ possession foi a week when I
was mocked for it. And in all honesty, until recentlv. I wouldn't have h i<
an open enough mind to give it a chance myself. Yet, since I've ovetconi
my preconceptions and prejudices about music and begun to judge with
my ears and not my head, whole new worlds have been opened lor me.
One of those is the world of country music.
On this newly remastered sophomore effort by the countn legend. \
son's characteristic pseudo-talking vocals are solid. In fact, this was the
album that first established him in the country world. But. Nelson is deli
nitely not the highlight of the album.
That honor goes to the fantastic backing band, the I c\as I loubadoui
a band that demonstrates everything that is good about countn iiiiisk . I

particular, fiddle player Wade Kay has
the Vliclas touch, turning every song he
plays on into a golden treasure. But, the
other soloists are also strong, and espe
cially on the upbeat country swing num
bers, play with a ferocity that is a joy to
hear.
