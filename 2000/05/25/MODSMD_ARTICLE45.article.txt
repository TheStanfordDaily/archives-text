# 'Having Our Say' a wasted chance
## 
### ZACH UDKO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Halfway through this clumsy and saccharine ode
to a century of Black America, Bessie (Saidah Arrika
Ekulona) lets us in on a little secret: "II it weren't for
those few nice ones we knew, I'd hate all white folks."
On opening night of San Jose Repertory's season
closing production of Emily Mann's biographical
Having Our Say, this is a moment of intense irony.
Why? Well, Bessie s talking almost entirely to an
elderly, conservative, white audience.
Bessie Delany is 101, and her older sister Sadie
(Bienda Ihomas) is 103. logether, they've experi
enced a near-full portrait of the African-American
experience. Its the same time period and issues at the
heart of last week's Drama Department production of
Venus Opal Reese's "Redemption," but you'd hardly
recognize any of it. The anger has been replaced by
humor, the condemnation exchanged for passive
ness. "Having Our Say" has been making the reper
tory rounds for a couple of years now, and only God
knows why. \ ou d think that America would be ready
for a good dose of reality, not sugar-coated niceties.
Ultimately, it all makes for a comfortable but
wholly unsatisfying evening of theater. No new
ground gets covered, but some audience members
will surely walk away from the evening with a guilt
less feeling of clean hands. God forbid Mann should
test the commercial audience or throw some contro
versy into the mix. I rue, she is working from two
real sources, the Delany sisters, who died at 104 and
109 in 1995 and 1999, respectively. But still, it all
feels oddly complacent for two real women who
have been through so much.
Bessie was one of the first female dentists in New

York City. Sadie became
the city's first black woman
school teacher in a white
school. They've experi
enced segregation, min
gled with Booker T. Wash
ington and W.E.B. Du√üois,
faced segregation head on
with the Jim Crow Laws,
and Bessie even came close
to being lynched.
At just over two hours
with two intermissions, the
show plays like an easily
digestible history lesson.
And to help the facts and
dates go down with even
more ease, Bessie and
Sadie prepare a scrump
tious Soul Food dinner
(complete with ambrosia,
macaroni and cheese, ham,
stuffing and turkey) right
before your eyes. If you
ever get bored by the play's

sense of apathy, you can always pick up a recipe or
two.
Of the two actresses, Thomas is by far the more
talented. Ekulona doesn't even have the voice to
play a convincing 50-year-old, much less double
that.
Tazewell Thompson tries too hard to make her
material accessible, and in the process dumbs down
an already simplified script. The three !i") minute
acts are far too short to absorb any substance. One
might have considered dividing the play into two

more substantial sections.
Donald Eastman deserves kudos for a homey set
one ol the more polished aspects of an otherwise
harmless evening of theatre.

"Having Our Say" loses the opportunity to make meaningful commentary in
favor of feel-gooa platitudes.
