"Angel of Music?" Try "You
Are Music."
The Phantom of the Opera has
taken up residence in San Jose,
but he's not singing Lord Andrew
Lloyd Webber's music. The Amer
ican Musical' Theatre of' San Jose is
presenting Maury Yeston and
Arthur Kopit's take on Gaston
Leroux's novel about the disfig
ured man who haunts the Paris
Opera I louse and takes a soprano
protege named Christine Daae
under his wing. Kristin Peterson
starts as Christine, and Richard
White, who originated Yeston and
Kopit's Phantom role, returns to
frighten the denizens of the ()pera
House.
Kopit's witty influence, expect
ed from the man who wrote "Oh
Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma Hung
you in the Closet and I'm Feeling
So Sad," is evident in the musical's
dialogue. Apart from the joking,
however, Kopit employs heavier
use of spoken dialogue than in the
Broadway version. The result is
much stronger character develop
ment and a more human story.
For example, the show takes a sig
nificant part of the second act to
tell the story of the Phantom's
birth and early years, revealing an
Oedipal angle that was down
played in the more famous show.
One jarring aspect of the pro
duction is the rapid series of
vignettes that form the first act.
The sets are rushed on and off the
stage as the Phantom teaches
Christine etudes, and Carlotta gets
bad review after bad review. The
pace slows down to a more com
prehensible rate, however, as the
show continues.
Yeston's music is definitely
memorable, without sticking in
your head as maddeningly as
" The Music of the Night." During

the performance and reprises of
the difficult song "You Are
Music," Peterson demonstrates
virtuoso technique in her ability to
belt it out and sing a shuddery,
tearful version equally well. Apart
from a few quickly resolved bal
ance problems with Peterson in
the first act, White is a joy to listen
to.
Ann Arvia formerly played
Madame Thenardier in "Les Mis
erables," and has crafted a very
similar character in Carlotta, the
diva who can't stand to see Chris
tine take her place as the prima
donna of the opera. She and con
ductor Marc Jacobs seem to have
an instinctive connection that
results in a nuanced, complex
vocal performance that still man
ages to be funny.
"Phantom's" gorgeous sets are
a triumph. If you have seen
Broadway's adaptation of the Dis
ney film "Beauty and the Beast,"
the asymmetrical, curving loops of
the set pieces will look familiar (In
another connection, White actual
ly sang the part of Gaston in
"Beauty and the Beast.") The
ambitious use of trompe I'oeil in
set painting adds considerable
depth to the Paris Opera House,
l he costume design, by a woman
named B Modern, is appropriate
ly lavish and ruffled. In one
sequence, Carlotta makes multiple
entrances in a series of diva cos
tumes, each one more ridiculous
than the last.
Dance plays a significant role in
the production, from elegant bal
let scenes incorporated into the
curtain calls to dramatic aerial
waltzes and a goofy 1 tango.
This "Phantom" is a thought
provoking character with uncon
trolled passions, dirty family
secrets, and an underground lair
for a home. Chances are, you'll
relate to at least one of his tribula
tions as you hum along to the cere
bral but melodic score.
