# Latest Demi film feels fated to flop
## 
### DAVID WELD 
Demi Moore, the only A-list per
former to emerge unscathed from
the late-eighties wreckage of the
Brat Pack, has had a rather c hec k
ered career since her last reallv suc -
cessful starring role, in the 199H
controversy magnet "Indecent
Proposal." Since then, she has
appeared in several consecutive
flops, including the disappointing
"C».I. Jane" and a critically vilified
adaptation of the "Scarlet Letter."
"Passion of Mind," the first
English-language film from Alain
Berliner (Ma Vie en Rose), does
not seem destined to buck this
trend.
The film focuses on the lives
of two women, both played by
Demi Moore: an American
widow living in the south of
France (Marie) and a hard-bitten
New York career woman
(Marty). Each one is dreaming
the life of the other; when Marty

goes to sleep in New York, she
dreams of .1 life in Provence as
Marie, and when Marie falls
asleep, she is similarly transport
ed to New York.
Each world seems equally real to
Marie/Marty, and the central
theme of the film is the question of
which life is truth, and which illu
sion. She is reluctant to give up
either one of the two lives, and
complications ensue when she
becomes romantically involved
with two different men, each of
whom subsequently becomes jeal
ous of their dream-rival. The
Taoist premise is actually fairly
interesting, but the potential of the
film is largely wasted by indifferent
acting and a cliche-littered script.
Along with Moore, the film stars
Stellan Skarsgard (a William 1 lurt
lookalike who seems to have a dif
ferent indecipherable accent for
each scene he appears in) and
William Fic littler (the extremely
odd-looking actor who played the

pyramid-scheming policeman in
"Cio"). Fhe two men play her
romantic interests in France and
New York respectively, and they
both grow somewhat tiresome in
their eternal sensitivity and touchy
feeliness. One finds oneself wishing
anarch ically for a cameo from for
mer Moore hubby Bruce Willis,
who could perhaps show up in his
traditional bloodied-but-unbowed
fashion, grimace fetchingly, and
inject some action into the other
wise stagnant progression of
events.
I he occasional sweepingly
ostentatious vista shot of tlie
French countryside, which ends up
looking computer-enhanced and
terribly out of place, provides one
of only a few visually interesting
elements in the movie. Another
one is a side view of a statue of Ms.
Moore over which the opening
credits are run — it is only later in
the film, when the camera circles
around, that we notice that there is

a huge chunk missing from the
other side of the statue's head. It is
at this point in ihe movie, towards
the end, that we begin to figure out
which of the two worlds is real, and
which characters exist onl\ inside
the protagonist's head.
This discover)' makes for an
engaging and occasionally fright
ening few minutes, as bits of each
world start to leak over into the
other. This is ihe only part of the
movie that really lives up to the
possibilities inherent in its concept.
After everything is settled, and
reality is safely separated from fan
tasy, the film ends as one would
expect: in a cloying pastiche of
heartwarming platitudes. The
audience is left hoping that Moore,
the producer of both of the much
loved Austin Powers movies, will in
the future concentrate on that
aspect of her profession, and let
her acting career fade into the gen
tle cinematic twilight of the late
20th century.
