# Festival features films from student artists
## 
### DAVID ARULANANTHAM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford is not known for the strength of
its film or acting programs like some other
schools. I hat was why I was surprised to find
out that there actual!) were student films
being produced on iliis campus and thai
they were being shown to the public. Not
one for big budget productions anywav, and
curious to see what my peers were up to, I
went to the Stanford Film Festival this p.ist
Friday night. Presented by the Stanford Film
Society (SFS), the Festival is in it > third year
and featured l"> films produced through SFS
grants and the I ndergraduate Film Work
shop.
Expecting to see a small number of com
mitted film enthusiasts at the event, instead I
saw a packed and overflowing Annenberg
Auditorium — comprised of more than just
the arts community at Stanford — so mam
that I wasn't able to get inside for the fit si
two works.

Overall the films were quite good artisti
cally, although their length made it more dif
ficult to develop and sustain a central theme
throughout the entirety in certain cases.
Moreover, a few were hampered bv less than
stellar acting performances. This also proba
blv skewed the audience's tastes — towards
fast-paced comedies.
I really enjoyed "I.'anteprima (preview in
Italian), ' b\ Katherine I ipson. It would be
<1 i flic nil to explain and convey the full mean
ing ol the movie with a description, but suf
fice 1 it to sav that the movie was in Italian
(with Fuglisii subtitles) and featured humor
ous dialogue along with different and some
limes random images of Florence.
Also deserving honorable mention was
"Fpiphatn Now," In C,litis C'.ussen and
(iregg Wilson, a movie that takes its title
from a self-help program that in essence
becomes the focus of the entire work. The
film follows the life of an actress/prostitute
w ho meets an uninspired v\ liter. I he work is
essentially about the task of discovering

human potential. Slow plot development is
rescued by better than average acting from
the film's cast.
Among the documentaries, Nathan Col
let's film, "Thaaism: Culture of Resistance,"
was my clear favorite. Examining the strug
gles of ;i Kenyan religious revivalist move
ment. the film was excellent on a technical
level and involved extensive and in-depth
research. It appears to have been shot most
ly in Kenya itself. I was ama/ed at the overall
quality of the work (especially since it was an
undergraduate documentary) and the fact
that it seemed very professional. My biggest
problem with the film was that it did not
make much of an effort to situate the storv
within ;i larger context of the colonial legacv
or current da\ African social problems —
something that would have made it easier to
appreciate the film's content for relativelv
uninformed audience members like mvself.
Moreover, the slant of the documentarv
sometimes appeared «i bit one sided and did
not present contrasting views.
