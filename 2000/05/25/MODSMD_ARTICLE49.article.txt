# Lots to love in music of Louisiana's bayous

### STEVEN RAPHAEL STAFF WRITER 
There's just something about New Orleans that seems to spark
new developments in music. Maybe it's the air, that almost palpa
bly thick blanket that envelops you every time you step outside.
More likely, it's the unique mixture of cultures, that special com
bination <>l French, Fnglish, and African that blended together to
become t ajiin < reole, iliitt is responsible for such originality.
()ver the yeai s. New Orleans has spawned more music than any
other citv in the world. Blues, jazz, funk, and zydeco, to name a
few, were all born deep in those swamps of Louisiana. In tribute
to that legendary bayou, I'uta-

mayo World Music lias
released two albums dedicated
to the music <>l Louisiana.
"Lousiaua Gumbo" is a
collection <>112 blues, soul and
R&U, while "/ydeco" is, as
indicated by the title, a collec
tion of /ydeco music. II only
lor the novelty to an uninitiat-

Ed listener, "/ydeco" seems to be the better ol the two albums.
/ydeco music is dance music typically credited to the Creoles of
Louisiana. It is distinguishable from other music largely due to its
unique instumenlation. I he two constants across all /ydeco music
are the accordion, which plays the role typically held by the gui
tar in most American music , and the rubboard. 1 lie rubboard is a

sheet of folded metal that is worn over the chest and scraped to
produce rhythmic sounds. At one time, it served as the primary
percussion instrument, though the modern development of the
drumset has relegated it to auxilary percussion.
Of course, it is inevitable that other instruments have also pen
etrated into the genre. In addition to the drumset, "Zydeco"
demonstrates that such instruments as bass guitar and lead guitar
have firmly planted themselves in zydeco soil.
Zydeco songs tend to be based upon either one chord vamps or
simple blues progressions, and the solos tend to be composed of
quite generic blues licks. Often, lead guitarists will enter playing
distorted blues riffs that seem at odds with the accordian back
ground. These soloists are clearly the weak link of modern zydeco.
Yet, the heart of the music is soul, and the lead singer/ accor
dion player (typically the same person) tends to make or break the
band. Consequently, many of the songs feature funky accordion
rhythms that drive the song forward and growling vocals, demon
strating that the singer indeed has "soul."
Nearly all of the songs on this album are upbeat and fun. Dance
beats radically different from the thumping, bass-heavy, dance
hall grooves of modern America abound, motivating even the
most uptight listener to move his or her body and demonstrating
beyond a doubt that zydeco is it's own unique art form.
I he album "Louisiansa Gumbo" seems less interesting overall,
though a part of that may be due to the vast volumes of imitation
floating around in mainstream music . The three styles of music
that album focuses on — blues, soul and R&B — have become sta
ples of modern music.

Although main do feature
the accordion, as a rule, the
songs on "Gumbo" tend to be
slower than those on "Zyde
co," and less interesting.
A few tracks stand out on
the album. "African Gumbo,"
by james Booker, is a won
derful example of true

"N'Awlins" flavor. It's difficult to pinpoint exact 1\ what it is about
the song that makes it feel so swampy; the best explanation is just
that tlu- syncopation comes in different patterns than are found in
any other musical style. Another exceptional track is by the leg
endary Neville Brothers. "Voodoo" is a funk number that skillful
ly interweaves piano, sax, vocals and drums into a web of soul.
Yet, one wonders why some of the most prominent New
Orleans musicians have been left off the album. Bo Dallis and the
Mardi (iras Indians and the Meters are two bands that immedi
ately spring into the mind of any true New Orleans affectionado.
Strangely, neither are represented on this collection.
Consequently, the album is much weaker than "Zydeco." Since
it is upbeat and fun and introduces a new music to listeners,
"Zydeco" is a worthwhile album for anyone willing to explore,
"dumbo." on the other hand, is old hat because it is markedly
similar to much modern music . I he fact that musicians elsewhere
can copy New Orleans music so well seems proof enough that the
music has nothing to do with the air and everything to do with
soul.
