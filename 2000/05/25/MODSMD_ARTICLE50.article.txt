### RENEE CANADA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With theii sexy looks and sensuous voices, Ricky Martin and Jennifer
Lope/ have become the latest archetypes of Latin music lor mainstream
listeners in the I nited Stales. With their radio-friendly, dance club hits,
these modern artists seem to take more from African American-domi
nated genres of hip-hop and R&B than from traditional Latin sounds
of salsa, merengue and flamenco.

Before this latest crop ol
Latin artists, when I thought <>1 ti'ue
Latin music, I retailed the lieav)
syncopation ol conga and bongo
drums and the deeply sensual,
shouldei shaking, hip-swaying
dances that stem from their infec
tious rhythms. ()r I thought ol the

flamenco with mustachioed men fingerpic king guitars and singing in
low, guttural tones. However, after listening to the latest Latin music
releases from Putumayo World Music, it is dear that Latin music has
been taking much from African music for generations.

"Republica Dominicana" is a compilation of the largely overlooked
music of the eastern portion of the Caribbean island Hispariola. While
this album features Dominican son and traditional merengue, the
album's main foc us is on bachata, the most popular music of the coun
try. Bachata blends Iberian melodies, African percussion, and promi
nent guitar playing that is at times reminiscent of Spanish flamenco.
While the musicians on this album were a treat to listen to, particularly
the lead guitarists, I found the high-pitched, nasally tone of the singers
difficult to swallow. The one exception was the smooth-voiced Bolivar
Peralta in his pleading, romantic ballad, "Immenso Amor". This ballad
also featured the unique guitar timbre of the bachata; though it is
incredibly tinny (and repetitive), there is something quite pretty and
otherworldly about it.
What I enjoyed most about "Republica Dominicana" was the African
rhythmic influence, which can be heard throughout the album; snappy
bongas and shuffling maracas in songs like Chichi Peralta's "Procura"
give them a distinctly African feel. Ricatclo Lemvo and Makina Loca
take the relationship between African and Latin music a leap forward
with their latest album, Sa> Salvador. Led by the African-born, Lemvo,
this album joyfully explores funk. Cuban son, soukous, Congolese
rumba, and a cappella, all framed by strong Afro-Latin rhythms.
Inspired by the history of the Congo, "Sac") Salvador" is a slow Con
golese rumba melded with Afro-Portuguese elements, beautiful and
wistful with acoustic guitar, accordion and the gentle vocals of Lemvo.
"Nganga Kisi" is a funky number with the blare of trumpets, rolling
piano, and rapping in Spanish, Knglish and French. Inspired by a
South African tune, "Dans La Koret" is a catchy, though repetitive, a
cappella song (except lor the repeated guitar line) that plays on the
instrumental capabilities of the human voice with clicks, whirs and
other percussive sounds. Lemvo is also featured on the album Mo'
Vicla, a cutting-edge collection of Latin- infused funk, rap (including
Lemvo's Nhanga Kisi), hip-hop,

ska and soul.
"Mo' Vida" is an infectious
dance party album, providing an
excellent survey of the constantly
evolving Latin music scene. Xiama
ra Kortuna's "Juana La Loca"

draws heavily on the Caribbean reggae groove with hints of inerengue.
Patricia Melee io's contagious "112 unky Latin Boogalu" is a reinvention of
c lassic boogaloo, \yhich combines Latin niambo, son, and c ha cha cha
with African funk and soul. Alliance 1 ihnik, with their
cast of members, talencls Frent h 'hi'p-lYop with (Cuban 11 rhythm
Limites," an irresistibly dauceable tune reminiscent of He La Soul.
Sharing heritage with Africa both ethnically and culturally, it is no
surprise that Latin and African music have bad such a successful fusion

ever since jazz trumpeter, Dizzy
Gillespie first teamed up with the
salsa master, Ghano Fozo. Though
the salsa groove is often the com
mon thread that lies them togeth
er, these albums explore the varied
influences which make up the true
melting pot flavor of Latin music .
