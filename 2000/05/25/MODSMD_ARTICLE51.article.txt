# One-man record label takes lots of work
## 
### STEVEN RAPHAEL STAFF WRITER 
As you step through the door of Dan Prothero's
Haight district San Francisco home, the first thing you
notice are the seemingly endless rows of cardboard
boxes covering the wooden floor. Straight back, a metal
shelf holds still more boxes, all of which house
Prothero's as yet unsold merchandise. His walls are
covered with framed, record-size representations of the
art he has done for his albums, including Galactic's first
two albums and Robert Walter's 20th Congress's
upcoming release.
"I pretty much do everything other than play the
music," says Prothero, who owns the San Francisco
based record lalx-1 Fog City Records. True to his word,
Prothero is singlehandedly carving a place for himself
in the music industry.
"What I'm l(x)king for is people that are performing
through a regional tradition," he explains. "It used to
be that you could drive down any of the major high
ways in America and every hour, you'd be able to pull
over to a new town where there'd lx* a new recipe for
apple pie ... [and] some family owned juke joint where
people would Ix* playing a certain kind of blues that
was different from [what you'd heard] two hours back."
Yet Prothero bemoans the fact that in this age of
M 1 V and McDonald's those unique regional influ
ences are fading away in favor of a media-directed
homogeneity. "But there are still these little pockets
like New Orleans, Texas, Mississippi," Prothero
explains. "I'm trying to preserve that."
To the right of the entrance, Prothero has dedicat
ed a room to this effort. Two ancient sound mixing
machines — which Prothero says he loves but never
uses for anything serious because they're too unreliable
— dominate the room. Further back, a cluttered desk
and computer hold sway. Prothero spends most of his
days in this room. Among other things, he gets over
100 e-mails every day to which he must respond. In
fact, before I have even left, he quickly returns to his
computer and begins typing. During the hour that 1
have taken him away from Fog City, Prothero has fall
en behind.
Although he spends nearly every waking moment
working for Fog City, Prothero says that he wouldn't
have it any other way. "I don't resent any amount of
time that I would spend," he explains. "What I'm
doing right now has about as much to do with what 1
want to accomplish in my life as anything that I can
imagine other than having a child."
Prothero is grateful that he found his true calling.
But his path to it was anything but straightforward.
A computer programmer by trade and a life-long
funk fan, Prothero spent years traveling the country in
search of rare funk records. Just for kicks, he bought a
sampler and began trying to recreate the classic funk
recording style he loved. S<x)ii, he was freelancing for
lcxal record labels like Übiquity Records as a producer
and as a graphic designer.
Then, in 1995, he ventured down to New Orleans

to record one of his favorite brass bands. Although that
recording didn't work out, Prothero was introduced to
the band Galactic. Prothero and Galactic impressed
one another; he saw potential in their music ("lx*ing a
fan of old funk music, I knew that they were on the
right path"), and they dug his recording style ("a min
imal number of mics and really making the drums
sound big and loud"). Soon, Prothero had signed on to
record the band's first album.
Yet, once the recording was done, Prothero
couldn't find a record lal)el to release the album. That
was the final factor that induced him to create Fog City
Records. "I knew how to run a record label, I thought,
and 1 really wanted to be the one putting it on the line
for something I believed in,"he explains. "So I just
said, I know it's a g<xxl record. People may not
relate to it right now, but 1 like it a lot and I'll put it out.'
With that in mind, Prothero set about creating a
record label. Although he lielieved in it with all his
heart, he didn't expect to get very good results. "Busi
ness wise, I t(x>k it about as seriously as my father would
have taken it,"he says."I was pretty much ready for it
to sell nothing."
Yet, to his credit, the album sold nearly 20,000
copies before attracting the attention of Capricorn
Records, who signed Galac tic and purchased the rights
to the album only two years later.
While a part of Prothero is proud to have drawn the
attention of a major label, another part of him regrets
giving up his first band. "But, I can say that when I
started working with Galactic, they were only playing
in New Orleans to a couple hundred people, and that
[in January], they played The Warfield to around
2,700 people 2,500 miles from their home. That's a
pretty gcx>d progression in a couple of years," he says.
One gets the impression that Prothero is a control
ling kind of person, with a specific idea of how every
thing should be clone. A perfectionist almost to a flaw
with the energy and passion to see his vision out, he
dominates our conversation, tirelessly giving exhaus
tive responses to every question I pose (and some that
I don't) while reclining on his couch with hands folded
behind his head. Dressed casually in jeans, lxx>ts and a
gray sweater, it's no challenge to imagine him spending
hour after hour, lost in his own world of record pro
ducing. Though it is midday, the shades here in the liv
ing room are drawn. As we talk, Prothero pulls his
baseball cap off his head, continually running his hands
through his short dark hair.
As Fog City's owner and sole employee, Prothero
cltx?s it all. He recruits new bands, engineers recording
sessions, and mixes and produces the records. 1 le then
creates the album artwork and does the multimedia
programming and videos for the enhanced CDs sold
by Fog City. Once the actual albums are ready, he next
formulates a marketing strategy and sees it through. In
addition to this, Prothero maintains a top quality Web
page for Fog City, www.fbgworld.com, as well as " The
Groove Guide," an Internet-based "portal" for people
interested in groove based music.

"What I am really into is the Inter
net in the larger sense, using it to create
the kind of community we used to have
in the three dimensional world,"
Prothero says. "1 really try to cultivate
anything that hints at the global village
concept, the little expert community
where you can talk to a person who
works there and ask them what's hip
and they'll tell you." He pauses for a
moment, lost in his thoughts. "It's a
slower road [for selling records], but 1
think it's a lot more long lasting."
Plus, it lets Prothero connect with
fans, which was part of his motivation
for starting the label in the first place.
Music can lx.' a lonely business, he says.
"It's like deferred happiness. You're
doing it now, imagining people will lis
ten to it later and have a good time."
Through his Internet skills, Prothero
simultaneously gives music fans advice
(as on the Groove Guide where he
points nationwide funk lovers toward
lcxal artists) and receives the feedback
he c raves.
Of course, one wonders if lie's hap
pier for it. 1 go to the bathroom, after
wards crossing the hall to wash my
hands in the bathtub since the sink is
broken, and return to find him dutiful
ly catching up on his email. Tooking
up, he acknowledges, "I spend seven
days a week, 24 hours [a day], minus a
few hours for sleep and a personal life,
working with this."
Sure enough, within fifteen minutes
of our sitting down, the phone was

already ringing — an urgent phone call from an engi
neer with whom Prothero works. Conscious of the
impression it might make on me, he tried to ignore the
call, but as the message blurted out of his answering
mac hine, he could no longer hold himself back. Apol
ogizingly, he grabbed his cordless phone and at that
point, 1 ceased to exist.
Prothero is a businessman, after all. But, he is the
rare kind of businessman who cares more about his
ideals than about making money. He'd rather sell
1,000 records to people who really love them than
10,000 to people who won't ever listen to them. "As
long as I'm not losing money, and as long as I never
have to turn clown signing a band because I don't have
any money on hand, then my business is a success," he
says.
()f course, he realizes that this puts him at odds with
the rest of the music industry. "I don't really think I'm
part of the music industry," he says."In an environ
ment where you always have to have 150 percent of the
profits from the previous year in order for your stock
to keep going up, that's not the environment in which
to groom artists.

"I'd like to think that I'm a little more in line with
the way Motown stal led oil. as fin ;is finding artists that
are diamonds in the rough, helping to polish them ;i lit
tle and to sell-actualize, and then doing their next
record as the best ever," he explains.
But even when that happens, Prothero still doesn't
expect any mainstream recognition — though he
wouldn't mind it."I think it would speak well ol sex iet\
il instrumental music, where the emphasis is not on
one front person, would get as much of a shot as the
'Bab) I love you' kind ol stuff," he savs. "But, I'm not
holding in\ breath, and I'm perfecth happ\ to stick it
out doing the kind of music I like. - '
Regardless of the tact that the numbers call his
record label a success, and regardless of the fact tli.it it
is his life, the reason why Prothero considers log < lit\
a success is because it fulfills his ideals. 1 le is able to use
all of his skills and interests toward making "a series of
surprisingly great records with bands that people had
never heard about before." and that makes him happ\.
"What I'm doing right now isexactlv what I'm capa
ble of doing and what I want to do with in\ life," he
says. "Once you have that realization, it's not really
work, its just what you arc.

As you step through the door of Dan Prothero's
Haight district San Francisco home, the first thing you
notice are the seemingly endless rows of cardboard
boxes covering the wooden floor. Straight back, a metal
shelf holds still more boxes, all of which house
Prothero's as yet unsold merchandise. His walls are
covered with framed, record-size representations of the
art he has done for his albums, including Galactic's first
two albums and Robert Walter's 20th Congress's
upcoming release.
"I pretty much do everything other than play the
music," says Prothero, who owns the San Francisco
based record lalx-1 Fog City Records. True to his word,
Prothero is singlehandedly carving a place for himself
in the music industry.
"What I'm l(x)king for is people that are performing
through a regional tradition," he explains. "It used to
be that you could drive down any of the major high
ways in America and every hour, you'd be able to pull
over to a new town where there'd lx* a new recipe for
apple pie ... [and] some family owned juke joint where
people would Ix* playing a certain kind of blues that
was different from [what you'd heard] two hours back."
Yet Prothero bemoans the fact that in this age of
M 1 V and McDonald's those unique regional influ
ences are fading away in favor of a media-directed
homogeneity. "But there are still these little pockets
like New Orleans, Texas, Mississippi," Prothero
explains. "I'm trying to preserve that."
To the right of the entrance, Prothero has dedicat
ed a room to this effort. Two ancient sound mixing
machines — which Prothero says he loves but never
uses for anything serious because they're too unreliable
— dominate the room. Further back, a cluttered desk
and computer hold sway. Prothero spends most of his
days in this room. Among other things, he gets over
100 e-mails every day to which he must respond. In
fact, before I have even left, he quickly returns to his
computer and begins typing. During the hour that 1
have taken him away from Fog City, Prothero has fall
en behind.
Although he spends nearly every waking moment
working for Fog City, Prothero says that he wouldn't
have it any other way. "I don't resent any amount of
time that I would spend," he explains. "What I'm
doing right now has about as much to do with what 1
want to accomplish in my life as anything that I can
imagine other than having a child."
Prothero is grateful that he found his true calling.
But his path to it was anything but straightforward.
A computer programmer by trade and a life-long
funk fan, Prothero spent years traveling the country in
search of rare funk records. Just for kicks, he bought a
sampler and began trying to recreate the classic funk
recording style he loved. S<x)ii, he was freelancing for
lcxal record labels like Übiquity Records as a producer
and as a graphic designer.
Then, in 1995, he ventured down to New Orleans

to record one of his favorite brass bands. Although that
recording didn't work out, Prothero was introduced to
the band Galactic. Prothero and Galactic impressed
one another; he saw potential in their music ("lx*ing a
fan of old funk music, I knew that they were on the
right path"), and they dug his recording style ("a min
imal number of mics and really making the drums
sound big and loud"). Soon, Prothero had signed on to
record the band's first album.
Yet, once the recording was done, Prothero
couldn't find a record lal)el to release the album. That
was the final factor that induced him to create Fog City
Records. "I knew how to run a record label, I thought,
and 1 really wanted to be the one putting it on the line
for something I believed in,"he explains. "So I just
said, I know it's a g<xxl record. People may not
relate to it right now, but 1 like it a lot and I'll put it out.'
With that in mind, Prothero set about creating a
record label. Although he lielieved in it with all his
heart, he didn't expect to get very good results. "Busi
ness wise, I t(x>k it about as seriously as my father would
have taken it,"he says."I was pretty much ready for it
to sell nothing."
Yet, to his credit, the album sold nearly 20,000
copies before attracting the attention of Capricorn
Records, who signed Galac tic and purchased the rights
to the album only two years later.
While a part of Prothero is proud to have drawn the
attention of a major label, another part of him regrets
giving up his first band. "But, I can say that when I
started working with Galactic, they were only playing
in New Orleans to a couple hundred people, and that
[in January], they played The Warfield to around
2,700 people 2,500 miles from their home. That's a
pretty gcx>d progression in a couple of years," he says.
One gets the impression that Prothero is a control
ling kind of person, with a specific idea of how every
thing should be clone. A perfectionist almost to a flaw
with the energy and passion to see his vision out, he
dominates our conversation, tirelessly giving exhaus
tive responses to every question I pose (and some that
I don't) while reclining on his couch with hands folded
behind his head. Dressed casually in jeans, lxx>ts and a
gray sweater, it's no challenge to imagine him spending
hour after hour, lost in his own world of record pro
ducing. Though it is midday, the shades here in the liv
ing room are drawn. As we talk, Prothero pulls his
baseball cap off his head, continually running his hands
through his short dark hair.
As Fog City's owner and sole employee, Prothero
cltx?s it all. He recruits new bands, engineers recording
sessions, and mixes and produces the records. 1 le then
creates the album artwork and does the multimedia
programming and videos for the enhanced CDs sold
by Fog City. Once the actual albums are ready, he next
formulates a marketing strategy and sees it through. In
addition to this, Prothero maintains a top quality Web
page for Fog City, www.fbgworld.com, as well as " The
Groove Guide," an Internet-based "portal" for people
interested in groove based music.

"What I am really into is the Inter
net in the larger sense, using it to create
the kind of community we used to have
in the three dimensional world,"
Prothero says. "1 really try to cultivate
anything that hints at the global village
concept, the little expert community
where you can talk to a person who
works there and ask them what's hip
and they'll tell you." He pauses for a
moment, lost in his thoughts. "It's a
slower road [for selling records], but 1
think it's a lot more long lasting."
Plus, it lets Prothero connect with
fans, which was part of his motivation
for starting the label in the first place.
Music can lx.' a lonely business, he says.
"It's like deferred happiness. You're
doing it now, imagining people will lis
ten to it later and have a good time."
Through his Internet skills, Prothero
simultaneously gives music fans advice
(as on the Groove Guide where he
points nationwide funk lovers toward
lcxal artists) and receives the feedback
he c raves.
Of course, one wonders if lie's hap
pier for it. 1 go to the bathroom, after
wards crossing the hall to wash my
hands in the bathtub since the sink is
broken, and return to find him dutiful
ly catching up on his email. Tooking
up, he acknowledges, "I spend seven
days a week, 24 hours [a day], minus a
few hours for sleep and a personal life,
working with this."
Sure enough, within fifteen minutes
of our sitting down, the phone was

already ringing — an urgent phone call from an engi
neer with whom Prothero works. Conscious of the
impression it might make on me, he tried to ignore the
call, but as the message blurted out of his answering
mac hine, he could no longer hold himself back. Apol
ogizingly, he grabbed his cordless phone and at that
point, 1 ceased to exist.
Prothero is a businessman, after all. But, he is the
rare kind of businessman who cares more about his
ideals than about making money. He'd rather sell
1,000 records to people who really love them than
10,000 to people who won't ever listen to them. "As
long as I'm not losing money, and as long as I never
have to turn clown signing a band because I don't have
any money on hand, then my business is a success," he
says.
()f course, he realizes that this puts him at odds with
the rest of the music industry. "I don't really think I'm
part of the music industry," he says."In an environ
ment where you always have to have 150 percent of the
profits from the previous year in order for your stock
to keep going up, that's not the environment in which
to groom artists.

"I'd like to think that I'm a little more in line with
the way Motown stal led oil. as fin ;is finding artists that
are diamonds in the rough, helping to polish them ;i lit
tle and to sell-actualize, and then doing their next
record as the best ever," he explains.
But even when that happens, Prothero still doesn't
expect any mainstream recognition — though he
wouldn't mind it."I think it would speak well ol sex iet\
il instrumental music, where the emphasis is not on
one front person, would get as much of a shot as the
'Bab) I love you' kind ol stuff," he savs. "But, I'm not
holding in\ breath, and I'm perfecth happ\ to stick it
out doing the kind of music I like. - '
Regardless of the tact that the numbers call his
record label a success, and regardless of the fact tli.it it
is his life, the reason why Prothero considers log < lit\
a success is because it fulfills his ideals. 1 le is able to use
all of his skills and interests toward making "a series of
