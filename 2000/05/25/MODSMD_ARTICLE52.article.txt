# Shaara's writing a family tradition
## 
### DANIEL MOREAU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Like Joseph Conrad — who
offered hope to many writers that
literary talent could still bloom late
in life — Jeff Shaara embarked on
his literary career at the relatively
old age of 32. But Jeff Shaara's gift
for storytelling, steeped in epic
American history, was like a dor
mant gene just waiting to express
itself.
When Jeff Shaara's father
Michael Shaara died in 1988, he left
Jeff with a prodigious literary career
to live up to. An acclaimed author,
Michael Shaara won the Pulitzer
Prize in 1975 for his novel " The
Killer Angels," which was the basis
for the movie "Gettysburg," direct
ed by Ron Maxwell.
It wasn't until the filmmaker
Maxwell suggested that Jeff contin
ue his father's work that Shaara
started writing. Previously operat
ing a rare coin business, Shaara had
no aspirations to become a writer.
"If my family wasn't completely
behind me, I wouldn't have expand
ed my father's writings," Jeff Shaara
said in an interview with Intermis
sion.
With virtually no writing experi

ence, Shaara commenced work on
his first novel "Gods and Generals,"
the prequel to his father's book
" fhe Killer Angels."
"I learned as I went along,"
Shaara said. "And that's the advice I
give young writers today: just
write."
Shaara said the important psy
chological factor in writing "Gods
and Generals" was having no expec
tations of the book's success.
Those low expectations, however,
produced a novel that was the
national bestseller for fifteen weeks.
Jeff Shaara's next book "The Last
Full Measure" benefited from equal
notoriety: it spent 13 weeks on The
New York limes bestseller list.
Shaara's latest showing, "Gone
for Soldiers" (which was released
May 2) is the farthest he has ven
tured from his father's work — in
both subject matter and voice.
"My wife was the first to notice
that I was finding my own voice,"
Shaara said. "[With 'Gone for Sol
diers'] for the first time I can accept
my own identity as a writer, as an
author, not just as the son of
Michael. . . . 'Gone for Soldiers' is
the first book that came from my
own ideas, my own desire to explore
a new story."

In "Gone for Soldiers," a novel
about the Mexican war, we find the
same characters that enlivened
"Gods and Generals, Ihe Killer
Angels," and " Ihe Last lull Mea
sure." In "Gone for Soldiers" Robert
E. Lee, who achieves later renown as
an old dignified Confederate sol
dier, is still a novice of war. And we
meet Thomas Jackson — future
Confederate general — long before
he is known as "Stonewall," a sobri
quet which he earns from his stand
at the first battle of Bull Run.
Shaara said lie saw the Mexican
war as one of tlie most overlooked
events in American history. "All the
figures that became famous in the
Civil War got their start in the Mex
ican war," Shaara said. In addition,
Shaara said the shape of the U.S., as
we know it today, grew largely out
of the outcome of the Mexican war.
But above all, it was the author's
fascination with character that draw
him to the Mexican war.
"History, like my novels, is driven
by characters, not events," Shaara
said. "So I try to show an original
historical figure in a new, interest
ing, and hopefully surprising way."
Shaara finds such a character in
Winfield Scott, a Union general who
during the Civil War was very much

past his prime.
But during tlie Mexican war,
Shaara said, "Winfield Scott was
considered the finest fighting man
of his generation. Scott took Lee
under his wing, and taught him how
to be a soldier."
Although Shaara said lie some
times feels like a spectator recording
history, his own personal experi
ence has found its way onto the
page. Because the author shares a
heart condition with his main char
acter, Lee, Shaara was able to ren
der Lee's first stroke as if it were a
firsthand account.
"In addition to a gift for story
telling, 1 also inherited a weak heart
from my father," Shaara said. "One
day sitting in my office, I felt an icy
cold hand reach up from under the
desk, and squeeze my heart."
Such is how Shaara describes
Lee's first c hest pains.
After three novels, and a project
in the works about the Founding
Fathers, Shaara said he still feels
extremely indebted to his father.
"II my father hadn't died, you'd
be interviewing him," Shaara said.
"'Clods and Generals' and ' I'lie Last
Full Measure' would have been his
books — in many ways, it was his
story to tell."
