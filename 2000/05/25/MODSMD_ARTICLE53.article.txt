# 'Spoonful' of hits
## 
### STEVEN RAPHAEL STAFF WRITER 
I've always thought that I h<* l.ovin' Spoonful never
received the credit the) were due. I mean, sure, thev
got inducted into the Roc k and R<>ll Hall of Fame, and
sure, their song, "1 )<> You Believe in Magic " was appro
priated by McDonald's (not to mention the movie
"American Pie"). But when was the last time von heard
a song of theirs, aside from "Magit or "Sunnnei in the
City" on the radio? And do vou actualh know anvone
who owns one of theii albums?
1 heir newly released greatest hits album proves that
the group, in lad, lias definitcK received more than
their share of credit. Fhrough 2(1 greatest hits, what
becomes clear is that the reason win the band had so
many hits over the vears is because nearh all of their
songs sound alike.
When the group really s< ores big is when the < bonis
has that special catchiness that makes it stirk in voui
head. Maybe I was biased toward those few songs that
I had heard again and again, but of the 2() bits, onh
three seemed

exceptional. Or
maybe that's the
reason why vou
never heat the
other songs on
the radio.
