Since Miss Sass has become such an
expert this year at constructing a sexu
al personality for The Daily, she decid
ed it was time to step into a sex chat
room to see what all the moaning was
about. Miss Sass was hoping to start
some hot action; unfortunately, the
online medium wasn't conducive to
hav ing realistic sexual encounters. And
honey, the encounters she had couldn't
even come close to the real thing.
I he transcript above is an edited
excerpt from a conversation in one of
the chat rooms Miss Sass visited. The
ones she saw were all pretty much the
same: people are constantly entering
and leaving, and most people are just
writing "hi" and "where are you from."
A few people are making sexual
offers, looking for people to play with.
These chat rooms can be found all over
the Internet on just about any porno
graphic site, and many are free. Most

offer your choice of sex room: lesbian, straight, barely legal,
foreplay, etc. You pick your room and enter the chat there.
Once you start a conversation with someone in the room,
you may be invited into a private bedroom, where you can
have a one-on-one encounter with another person.
Miss Sass went to one such bedroom with an identity
named "Kxec." Exec claimed to be a 21-year-old beautiful
blond with size (1 breasts (she ottered, Miss Sass didn't ask).
Miss Sass lias a sneaking suspicion, however, that Exec may
have in fact been a 45-year-old balding man who can't get ii
up with his wife.
Regardless, Miss Sass entered the room with this Exec
character and typed, "What would you like to do?" Exec
responded immediately with, "I'm going to suck your clitoris.
Are you shaved?" (Again, this text is slightly edited.)
Wow, this Exec character really gets right to the point,
thought Miss Sass. Whatever happened to kissing and caress
in S ?
I his directness seemed to be a common trend in the chat
rooms, though, which made the interactions boring. If you
have sex with a character immediately, there's not much left
to do.
In the open rooms with lots of people, the moment Miss
Sass started to interact with a character, she was often asked

to describe intimate parts of her body or what she was wear
ing. Because these sites aren't reality, Miss Sass had good time
"pretending" and constructing a new sexual identity with
each person she played with.
I he biggest problem with these chat rooms has to do,
again, with the medium. I rving to read what lots of people
are saying at the same time you're writing is distracting. 1 lie
experience leels fragmented especially because so main dif
ferent people are trying to play with you ai once.
On several occasions, Miss Sass louud bersell interacting
with multiple characters in diHerein parts of the room simul
taneously, which is a bit disorienting, loo much was happen
ing at once, and too many people were walking in saying, for
instance, "hi i am 22 with a voting hot sexy bodv, 30.22.24
I 14 pounds hazel eyes shoulder length blonde hair with sexy
legs..."
Miss Sass also bad trouble remembering that the chat
rooms weren't supposed to be emotional places, for instance,
every time Miss Sass was talking to another character and that
c harac ter left for a bedroom with someone else, Miss Sass felt
rejected. Bizarre.
flic strangest part of the experience, in Miss Sass's opin
ion, was the number of people in every chat room she visited
in the middle of a Sunday afternoon. Some were so full of

"members" iluit she couldn't even get
in. Clearly these barely-erotic and
unfulfilling sites are a common pasttime
for quite a few people.
According to The New York limes,
studies show that a third of all Internet
visits are directed to sexually oriented
Web sites, chat rooms and news groups.
While most people use these sites for
harmless recreation, sex experts are
calling "cybersex addiction" a brand
new psychological disorder.
Miss Sass supposes she should have
seen it coining: when you can get it free
and there's no consequences, why
wouldn't you try to get off as often as
possible? Unfortunately, no one expect
ed that sex would become like a heroin
addiction lor the men and women who
now spend dozens of hours seeking sex
ual stimulation online using images and
sex chat rooms.
Statistics show a minimum of
200.000 men and women have become
cybersex addicts in the lasi few years.
Experts sav that cybersex lends itself to
repetition, because the intense orgasms
take minimal time and energy.
Worst of all, some cybersex addicts
become conditioned to be sexually
aroused by their computers. Thus,
addicts whose jobs involve computers
face serious problems, because just sit
ting down to work starts a distracting

sexual response.
Miss Sass understands that the anonymity and immediacy
of cybersex, especially with some idealized partner, could be
gratifying, but she' wouldn't recommend it. I he interactions
with other people aren't particular!) fulfilling, and the events
described are more < ommonplace than erotic.
Miss Sass hates to say it, but the majority of characters in
chat rooms write so poorly that it would be hard to get too
interested in what the\ have to saw
Instead, Miss Sass advises vou to find erotic sites with pic
tures or literature that you feel comfortable with. 1 lie text of
most erotic stories online is far more interesting than the
streaming conversations in a chat room.
Mav is National Masturbation Month, after all, so you
might as well turn on your computer and have a good time!
