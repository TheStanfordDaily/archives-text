# Searching for good writers
## 
### 
Well, kiddies, this is it. This is the
end of the road for Nothing hut Net.
I know, I know, hut I just can't do
n anymore. I just won't have the time,
von have to understand.
I ley now, stop c rying. I mean it. I
just can't.
Anvway, I'll get to the point tor the
lew that might still be reading my little
(oilier of the hack page. Yes, the
point, and that would be helping
make the Internet a less scary place by
figuring out those search engines.
Yawn, I know, hut if you've really
found my column that scintillating,
you should contact
daily.sianford.edu to be
the next Web column writer. Really,
I'm not kidding.
Search engines claim to make
C.yberworld accessible for their users,
and, honestly, most of us wouldn't be
able to Unci squat without using a filter
of some sort. I mean, you could keep
tvping in random web addresses until
you find the one you want, but I
wouldn't recommend it.
but because we defer to the
engines, allowing them to decide
which sites get traffic and which
should fall away from the public spec
trum, we allow them to control us.
And there isn't much we can do about
th,it except make an informed deci
sion about our search portal.
Right now all the www.yahoo.com
users are surprised to hear that there
other portals even exist. There are
many out there — and some are better
than the old benchmark for searching.
I.ike www.google.coni. Google is a
Stanford-grown production like
Yahoo! but has managed to keep their
approach simple. Their site has none
of the c ategories and side banners that
litter www.yahoo.com, and their
search results are easy to browse.
With its simplicity come some
faults, though. On a sample search for
sites about Tim Roth, Google came

last with 1 0,000 pages. Yahoo!
returned 28,000 for the same search
string.
If the number of hits is the measure
of a search engine's prowess,
www.iioithernlight.coin should reign
supreme. Northern Light's engine
returned 30,000 pages having some
thing to do with that funny little Brit.
Too had half of the sites were
repeats. A subsequent search reaf
firmed my conclusion that Northern
Light doesn't do a good job of weed
ing out the sites that show up more
than once for a single search string.
In any case, their engine will get
you a good selection of sites. That's
more than can be said for Netscape's
search function. Please don't ever hit
that cute little 'search' button on the
top of your Navigator. It will be
worthless - you won't find anything
but the most mainstream site in the
genre you seek.

And this is where The Man steps in
to control your perception of the
world, www.lycos.coin admits to this
blatantly. Ihe first live sites returned
by an) search using their engine are
based on "user selection trafficSo
the first sites you will see will only be
the most popular ones. So you don't
really get to think for yourself. So you
become like every one else.
If you come away from my column
with anything other than a bored,
vacant expression, it should be a good
dose of cynicism. I lie Man is definite
ly out to get you. Don't let the bastard
control you — light, light, light.
1 hat includes not settling for the
first search result the next time you
are looking for a site. Or signing up to
write this column in the future — so
you c an be trained in the ancient art of
Webcynic ism, and continue the tradi
tion in the name of all that is good and
pure.
