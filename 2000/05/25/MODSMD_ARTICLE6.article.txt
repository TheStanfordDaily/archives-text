Editor's Mote: Today's story is the third in a weekly seiies
looking back at the eight-year tenure of outgoing University
President Gerhard Casper. Each week, we reflect on a major
issue that has marked his presidency. Today, we look at the
controversial issues of gender equity and academic tenure.

"Throughout my 20 years as an academic leader,
and indeed since my days as a young faculty mem
ber, I have been concerned with the problems of race
and gender equity at universities â€” among the most
difficult and complex issues faced by our society."
University President Gerhard Casper's words,
from an April 27 Faculty Senate meeting, capture
one of his greatest challenges during his years at
Stanford: charges of sexual and ethnic discrimina
tion in Stanford's academic tenure tracks.
In a university famed for its racial and ethnic di
versity among students, many have deemed it par
ticularly surprising that Stanford should have a pre
dominantly white, male faculty. Despite criticism of
Stanford's faculty atmosphere, both Casper and for
mer Provost Condoleezza Rice cite overall progress
in the University's treatment of female and minority
faculty and project optimistically for the future.
At the aforementioned Faculty Senate meeting,
Casper said he believes that, "[University adminis
trators] have done our best to engage in affirmative
action, to assure equity, to maintain the highest stan
dards that are the common goal of male and female

faculty of all ethnic backgrounds and to forego
rhetoric that never does justice to the great com
plexity of the issues."
But, Casper continued, "maintaining and fur
thering one of the best universities in the world is an
incredibly delicate task." In a later inteiA'iew, he cited
the difficulty of maintaining both faculty integrity
and faculty diversity. He cited minimal growth offac
ulty and the elimination of a mandatory retirement
age as reasons for this lack of growth and consequent
lack of tenured positions to fill.
Casper's assessment comes after two years of fre
quent controversy over Stanford's faculty divei-sity.
In November 1998, more than a dozen women filed
a class-action suit against the University, claiming
that Stanford's treatment of female faculty violated
affirmative action laws.
