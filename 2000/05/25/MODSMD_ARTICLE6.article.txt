# Casper reflects on gender, tenure
## 
### DEENA SKOLNICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Editor's Mote: Today's story is the third in a weekly seiies
looking back at the eight-year tenure of outgoing University
President Gerhard Casper. Each week, we reflect on a major
issue that has marked his presidency. Today, we look at the
controversial issues of gender equity and academic tenure.

"Throughout my 20 years as an academic leader,
and indeed since my days as a young faculty mem
ber, I have been concerned with the problems of race
and gender equity at universities â€” among the most
difficult and complex issues faced by our society."
University President Gerhard Casper's words,
from an April 27 Faculty Senate meeting, capture
one of his greatest challenges during his years at
Stanford: charges of sexual and ethnic discrimina
tion in Stanford's academic tenure tracks.
In a university famed for its racial and ethnic di
versity among students, many have deemed it par
ticularly surprising that Stanford should have a pre
dominantly white, male faculty. Despite criticism of
Stanford's faculty atmosphere, both Casper and for
mer Provost Condoleezza Rice cite overall progress
in the University's treatment of female and minority
faculty and project optimistically for the future.
At the aforementioned Faculty Senate meeting,
Casper said he believes that, "[University adminis
trators] have done our best to engage in affirmative
action, to assure equity, to maintain the highest stan
dards that are the common goal of male and female

faculty of all ethnic backgrounds and to forego
rhetoric that never does justice to the great com
plexity of the issues."
But, Casper continued, "maintaining and fur
thering one of the best universities in the world is an
incredibly delicate task." In a later inteiA'iew, he cited
the difficulty of maintaining both faculty integrity
and faculty diversity. He cited minimal growth offac
ulty and the elimination of a mandatory retirement
age as reasons for this lack of growth and consequent
lack of tenured positions to fill.
Casper's assessment comes after two years of fre
quent controversy over Stanford's faculty divei-sity.
In November 1998, more than a dozen women filed
a class-action suit against the University, claiming
that Stanford's treatment of female faculty violated
affirmative action laws.
By the time the suit was announced in February

1999, the number of people Tiling
had grown to 32, including several
minority men. The U.S. Depart
ment'of is sfill investigating
the case, which has at stake $500
million in federal grants and con
tracts should the Department find
evidence of ongoing discrimina
tion.
This past January, the Labor
Department released the names of
those filing suit. Although the
women claimed a breach of priva
cy, Stanford retaliated by saying
that it could not possibly address
their complaints without knowing
their names. Following this an
nouncement, one woman with
drew her suit and four others
reached an out-of-court settle
ments.
Stanford lost the only gender-re

lated case it has followed to court
last month. Stanford was ordered to
pay $545,000 to former Medical
School researcher (Colleen Crangle,
when courts agreed she was fired in
retaliation for her claims of gender
discrimination.
Hie University plans to appeal
this the meantime, the
verdict has buoyed the hopes ol the
plaintiffs in the I*ibor Department
suit.
Casper, claiming he was trying
to heal the lift between the Univer
sity and its faculty, offered a possible
solution. "We need to change the
culture of our schools and depart
ments," he said.
"We need to make them for the
faculty, and particularly for the
young faculty, environments that
ate very supportive, that are intel
lectually stimulating."
Incoming University President
John Hentiessy admitted that gen
der and racial inequities in the fac
ultv are serious concerns that Stan

ford must address.
"Women and minorities contin
ue to be underrepresented, though
we are making steady progress,"
1 lennessy said.
Casper warned that no solu
tion can be perfect or immediate.
He said, "It is also true that most
faculty work very, very hard to
begin with, just in terms of de
mands on them for their own
teaching and for their own re
search. Some find it hard to also
deal with all the other issues that
clearly the University needs to
address."
Casper claimed that the Univer
sity has made "slow, steady
progress" in this area, but that little
can be done to accelerate change.
I his answer is not enough for some
Stanford faculty, including Laura
Carstensen, director of Stanford's
(-enter tor Research of Women and
Gender.
"We are improving, but our
competition is improving as fast or

faster," Carstensen told the San
Francisco Chronicle last year.
Rice, then the University
provost, answered complaints such
as Carstensen's by citing numbers
showing an increase in female fac
ulty ,u
"We have made significant
progress, but there is more to be
done," Rice told the San Francisco
Chronicle last May. "I am sure that
with gtxxl-faith efforts throughout
the faculty, things will get better
and better."
Numbers released this year
show that the number of tenured
women are on the rise in nearly all
University departments, both in the
humanities atjd the sciences.
Casper said he still believes the
creation of a greater faculty com
munity is at least a partial solution
to the problem. "We have to say,
'It's our department, it's our Uni
versity, it's our school,' and I think
we need to say it more often. It's
ours."
