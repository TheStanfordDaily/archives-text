## 
### GREG PAGE STAFF WRITER 
Richard Bush, board chairman and manag
ing director of the American Institute in Taiwan,
spoke yesterday to a standing-room-only audi
ence at the Bechtel Conference Center in Enci
na Hall.
The speech, titled "Political Change in Tai
wan: Implications for U.S. Policy," centered on
the effects on last week's election of Taiwan Pres
ident Chen Shui-Bian and on the state of recent
relations between the United States, China and
Taiwan.
Bush's tone was generally optimistic in light
of the trend toward democratization in Taiwan,
as well as the creation of dialogue between Tai
wan and mainland China.
"This should be a time for seizing opportuni
ties, not creating obstacles or conflict," Bush em
phasized. "[The democratic election] truly is an
important transformation in Taiwan's political
life; elections and transfers of power make lead
ership more accountable. In democratic sys
tems, leaders' decisions will be shaped by public

opinion.
I lowever, Bush reminded his
audience that Taiwan's future re
mains uncertain.
"We need to look not only to
'who' in this election, but also to
'what': what will be the new configu
ration of the Taiwanese political sys
tem and what will l)e the conse
quences? We're moving into un
charted territory; some might say
dangerous territory."
Bush characterized recent Chi
nese* Taiwanese relations as "up
and down over the last fifteen
years." I le noted that in the late '80s
and early '90s, economic improve
ments in Asia coincided with im
proved relations. This period of
goodwill culminated in a meeting
of Chinese and Taiwanese leaders
in Singapore in 1993, but unrav
eled in the mid-'9os.
Relations reached a nadir last
year when Taiwan's President Lee

leng-Hui said that relations be
tween China and Taiwan constitut
ed state-to-state relations.
Lately, however, said Hush, the
relationship between Taiwan and
China has been on the mend. This
change is Ix'st symbolized by the
election of Chen, a middle-of-the
road politician who has pledged
not to declare Taiwanese indepen
dence or to hold a referendum con
cerning Taiwanese sovereignty.
Bush lauded Chen as "willing to
resume dialogue with the mainland
on any issue," and praised Chen's
"remarkable flexibility and re
straint."
Bush said the United States
would affirm its "one-China" policy
but take a passive role in negotia
tions across the Strait of Taiwan.
"The U.S. hopes both sides will
take a creative approach in improv
ing cross-Strait relations through
dialogue," he said. "We do have a
profound interest in peace and sta
bility in the region."
Bush concluded by discussing
the positive effects of recent increas
es in trade between Taiwan and the

mainland.
"These ties are not trivial," he in
sisted, "for they're based on com
mon interest and cultural bonds."
Economic ties, he said, create "dis
incentive to conflict, and a founda
tion for all forms of ccxjperation, in
cluding political cooperation."
The speech was presented by
the Shorenstein Forum in connec
tion with Stanford's Asia/Pacific Re
search Center.
After receiving his doctorate in
political science from Columbia
University, Bush worked as a con
gressional adviser before becoming
a national intelligence officer spe
cializing in Chinese affairs.
In Bush's current role with the
American Institute in Taiwan, he
conducts what are essentially unof
ficial diplomatic relations between
the U.S. government and Taiwan.
The directors of the institute are ap
pointed by the Secretary of Suite.
Because the United States does
not recognize Taiwan as a separate
nation from the rest of China, there
is no official ambassador to the is
land.
