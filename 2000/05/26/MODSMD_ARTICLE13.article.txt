## Problems for China trade bill emerge in Senate 
### 
WASHINGTON (Al 1 ) — 1 lie Clinton
administration-backed bill to expand
trade with (lliin a ran into problems in the
Senate on I Inirsday, a dav alter it won
solid approval in the I louse.
Opponents from both the political
right and left served notice lliev would
use potentiallv time-consuming tactics to
hold the bill up to scrutiny and amend
ment.
"1 want to make sure there are votes to
deal with serious human rights questions,
the rights of workers to organi/.e, trade
compliance," said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-
Minn. "It's something that I can do and

should do and I'll be out there. I don't
intend to be shut out."
Wellstone was expected to team up
with Sen. Russ I-eingold, l)-Wis.. in push
ing a rait of labor-supported amend
ments. Organized labor has waged a
fierce campaign against the bill, which it
sees as a threat to I ,S. workers' jobs.
from the other end of the political
spectrum. Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
pledged not to let the Senate "rubber
stamp" the House-passed measure and
advised China-trade supporters to bold
oil On "popping the champagne corks."
Helms promised "voles — perhaps

uncomfortable votes - on a range of
issues."
Sens. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and
Robert lorricelli, l)-N.|., announced
I luirsdav that they, too, would seek to
modify the China trade bill. They want to
set up a mechanism to monitor Chinese
weapons proliferation.
Still others were expected to tr\ to
attach a provision to increase l .S. mili
tai \ ties with Taiwan.
Because of the exhaustive battle that
led up to Wednesday's 2;^7-l ( .)7 vote in
the I louse, neither side paid much atten
tion to the Senate — until now.

1 lie hill is ultimately expected to win
overwhelming support in the Senate,
where the Finance Committee has
approved it 18-1.
But hopes by Senate Majority Leader
1 rent Lott, R-Miss., tor a "clean" bill —
one without amendments like the one
that passed the Finance Committee —
were complicated by House — added
amendments, including one to establish a
commission to monitor human rights in
(Ihina.
The House also adopted amendments
to protect U.S. companies against surges
in Chinese imports and to increase funds

for Radio Free Asia.
Lott called the House amendments
"substantial" and said, "We'll have to
decide how to deal with their add-ons."
Since the additional language goes
beyond trade issues, other committee
chairmen might seek to assert jurisdic
tion, including Helms, chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Time could be an important factor,
with the summer political convention and
campaign season fast approaching.
A delay in the Senate could cause the
administration to revert to extending
trade benefits to China on a yearly basis.
