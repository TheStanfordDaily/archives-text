# Clinton wants to regulate online drugs
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — New laws are
needed tor regulating online pharmacies that
are writing prescriptions and selling dings
over the Internet, often illegally, the Clinton
administration told Congress yesterday.
A I louse subcommittee taking it first look at
the administration's proposal submitted earli
er this month was told how the spiraling
growth in sales of prescription drugs over the
Internet is overwhelming drug safety regula
tors and law enforcement agencies.
In one case, a 1 (>-vear-old boy bought Via
gra and two other controlled substances from
a doctor's Web site after only filling out a diag
nostic questionnaire. I Ik- physician was prose
cuted under a st;ite law, but only because lie
sold the drugs to a minor.
"Online pharmacy sites often circumvent
the traditional protections built into the doc

tor-patient relationship, sik li as diagnosis
based on a phvsical examination," Dcput)
Associate Attornev General F.ihan Posner told
the I louse Commerce investigations subcom
mittee.
I mil now, I'osner said, the government has
largeh relied on health professionals — p 11 \ si -
ci.ins and pharmacists — to protect patients
from knowinglv or acc identalb misusing pre
scribed medicines that could cause them
harm.
"We're going to need some legislation that
will better define the law and provide more
tools to enlorcc it, panic ulai l\ where lolks are
getting access to prescriptions without a doc
tor's prescription itself." said Fred I pton, R-
Mic h., the subcommittee's chairman.
k;ins,is Attornev General ( aria |. Stovall
said differing state laws and evasive practices

have made regulating Internet pharmacies
and prosecuting illegal prescription sales both
difficult and time-consuming.
"We all had to sort through multiple shell
corporations, addresses that turned out to be
mail drops, and overlapping physical and
Internet addresses shared In different enti
ties," she said. "Companies selling dangerous
drugs ac ross state lines should be required to
maintain current, accurate, accessible informa
tion about their principals, their physical
addresses and tlu-ir identities."
All of that would be required under legisla
tion that the Food and Drug Administration
submitted to ('.ongress earlier this month. I lie
FDA-sought law also would require online
pharmacies to be licensed in each state in
which thc\ operate or deliver prescription
drugs.
