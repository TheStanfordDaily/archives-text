# Pentagon rules in favor of privacy

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Top
Defense Department public
affairs officials violated Linda
Iripp's privacy rights by releasing
information from her personnel
file to a reporter in 1998, but they
did not act under White House
influence, an internal report
made public yesterday concluded.
In response to the finding by
the Pentagon's inspector general.
Defense Secretary William Cohen
sent letters to Kenneth Bacon,
assistant secretary for public
affairs, and to Clifford H.
Bernath, formerly Bacon's main
deputy, "to express my disap
pointment" in their judgment.
Cohen said their actions were
"hasty and ill-considered," but
added: "This was a departure
from the very high quality of per
formance that you have otherwise
exhibited."
Spokesman Rear Adm. Craig
Quigley said Cohen considers the
matter closed and will taken no
further action.
Bacon and Bernath were
involved in informing a reporter
lor The New Yorker magazine in
March 1998 that Tripp stated on
a security clearance form she
never had been arrested. In fact,
Tripp was arrested for grand
larceny as a teen-ager, a charge
later reduced to loitering.
Tripp has filed a civil suit
against the Defense Department
over the release of the informa
tion from her personnel records.
Sen. James M. Inhofe, who has
called for Bacon's resignation,
denounced Cohen's response as a
"whitewash and cover-up."
" I he law was broken and noth
ing is being done about it," said
Inhofe, R-()kla., adding that both
Bacon and Bernath should be
prosecuted.
Ihe justice Department in
April declined to seek prosecu
tion, saying there was insufficient
evidence to prove that Bacon and
Bernath knowingly violated the
Privacy Ac t of 1974.
1 ripp's lawyers, in a statement,
ac c used Bacon of having partici
pated knowingly in a "public rela
tions smear campaign" orches
trated by the White House to
undermine I ripp's credibility.
They urged Clinton to overturn
(lohen's action and "order proper
punishment and remedial
actions" against Bacon.

Quigley said Cohen chose not
to make his letters a part of either
Bacon's or Bernath's permanent
personnel file. Cohen ordered
more training on the Privacy Act
for all Pentagon public affairs
employees.
Bacon, who is Cohen's chief
spokesman and normally con
ducts news briefings at the Pen
tagon, chose not to attend yester
day's because of his personal
involvement in the investigation,
Quigley said. In a brief interview
later, Bacon said he had tried to
strike a balance between open
government and privacy protec
tion.
"Obviously, at the time it did
not occur to me that the, Piracy
Act would preclude disclosure of
what a public official had said
about her public arrest record on
a security clearance form," Bacon
said.
Tripp, who secretly recorded
conversations with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky,
worked for Bacon in the Pen
tagon's public affairs office, as did
Lewinsky. Tripp remains a
Defense epartment employee but
works in a public affairs office out
side the Pentagon.
Tripp's secret taping of conver
sations with Lewinsky gave Inde
pendent Counsel Kenneth Starr
evidence of a sexual relationship
between Lewinsky and Clinton.
That evidence was used as a base
for the impeachment trial against
the president.
On Wednesday, Maryland
prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli
chopped wiretap charges against
I ripp. He said a judge's decision
limiting testimom from Lewinsk\
left him unable to prove that
Tripp recorded a telephone con
versation with Lewinsky in
December 1997 without her con
sent.
Starr defended his decision to
grant federal immunitv to Tripp.
"At the time, we needed the infor
mation and so we, consistent with
Justice Department practices,
granted immunity," he told
reporters yesterday. "But it was ;i
limited form of immunity."
