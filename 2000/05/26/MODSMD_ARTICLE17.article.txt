attorneys are expected to make few struc -
tural changes to their original plan, the
source said. Whatever the government's
proposal, jackson still has the final say on
how a breakup would work.
The initial |usticc Department plan
called lor the breakup of Microsoft into

two pieces — one governing the Win
dows operating systems lor personal com
puters and large corporate servers, and
the other governing the popular
Microsoft Office suite, the Internet
Fxplorer Web browser and Microsoft's
various Internet properties.
I he two industry groups, the Software
and Information Industry Association
and the Computer and Communications
Industry Association, supported the gov
ernment's breakup plan, but suggested
the judge go one step further bv spinning

oil Internet Fxplorer into a third compa
ny. Fhe groups noted that Jackson had
found Internet Explorer was a key in
Microsoft's crushing of its competitors.
Flic judge ruled April 3 that Microsoft
violated antitrust laws.
Alternatively, the industry groups said,
Microsoft's Internet Fxplorer browser
could remain with the applications com
pany, but the computer source code used
to create the browser should be made
"open source," meaning it would be part
of the public domain for anyone to use

and alter as they see fit.
"To allow a Microsoft successor to use
the browser as a point of leverage (or a
means of protection) for its dominant
applications suite would reward Microsoft
for its illegal conduct, even if the benefits
did not accrue to the operating systems
business," the groups said in their brief.
Jackson took both sides by surprise on
Wednesday when he cut off further
debate on remedies against Microsoft.
I lie Justice Department will provide a
revised version of its plan.
