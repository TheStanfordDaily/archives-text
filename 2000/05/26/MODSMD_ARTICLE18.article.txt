## The 						Stanford Daily Bootleg freshman T-shirt design causes controversy 
### 
SE

FRKSI I MAN J C )I I NAT! LAN Akchin's
recent decision to resume selling
James Bond-themed freshman
class T-shirts, despite a controversy
tall quarter surrounding a lack of racial
diversity and negative presentations of
women depicted on them, seems an unwise
and insensitive one.
Though Akchin, a member of the ASSU
Frosh Council, redesigned the T-shirt so
that the figures on the back now reflect the
ethnic diveristy of Stanford students, it is
disconcerting that he decided to circum
vent the Frosh Council's original decision
not to market the T-shirt. It seems that the
Frosh Coucil must have had compelling

reasons not to try to salvage the original
James Bond design in the first place, and
Akchin should have honored their decision
as well as the concerns of those freshmen
who felt offended by the shirt.
Marketing the T-shirt is Akchin's light to
freedom of speech, but the way he chose to
do so makes a mockery of both the people
who complained about the T-shirt and the
Frosh Council's decision to ban the shirt in
the first place.
He sent out an e-mail to the class say
ing: "Remember those James Bond
es(jiie, Class of 2003 T-shirts that everyone
liked, but were not [politically correct]
enough to bear the official name of the

ASSU or Freshman Council? Well they
are back for sale .... Enjoy this semi-legal
apparel before the bueaucracy cracks
down." He also informed freshmen that
the T-shirt was not an official one for the
Class of 2003.
Akchin himself seems to be noting in this
e-mail that what he is doing is not right,
hence the bureaucracy cracking down on
him, and at the same time he undermines
the concerns of the students who were
opposed to having the design on the class
T-shirt by implying that they prevented the
rest of the freshmen from enjoying a T
shirt that "everyone liked."
There are actions Akchin could have

taken to make the remarketing of the
James Bond Class of 2003 T-shirt less con
troversial. First, before he even decided to
redesign the shirt, he should have consult
ed with those students who were offended
by the original design to see if they would
mind him trying to salvage the design.
If they had approved, he should also
have consulted with the people — fresh
men Anna-Christina Douglas and Deborah
Costa —who originally designed the shirt
(Which he did not do), to see if they mind
ed if he altered their design.
If they didn't mind, he then should have
marketed the T-shirt in a more sensitive
and accurate manner than he did.
