# THERE IS NO SPOON
## Memories and Mickey D's 
### 
A large portion of our lile is
routine. We eat, sleep and go
to <l;iss routinely. And like
ti 1:1 n\ other parts of life, parts
of our routine change as we grow
older. When I was <), I'd wake up
every morning at 0:30 a.m. just to
watch the "Care Beat s" on the Disney
Channel (did I really just admit that?).
My freshman year of high school, 1
used to swim 20 hours a week. Fresh
man year of college, I used to eat 20

slices ol pi//a a week.
Bui the one thing
I've noticed about
routine is tli.it no
matter how old we
are, our routine
ahvavs equals safety.
I lie world may start
spinning the opposite
way, but within our
routine ,we will feel
< onipletely fine. Am I

being vague? Here's an example.
I love M< Donalds. When you see
the Mi Donald's motto "Billions
Served." what the)'re really saying is,
"Millions of regular hamburgers with
out pickles served to |it. I will never
tire ol McDonald's extra value meals.
And when I keel over and die of a
heart .mack at the age of 2(>, I intend
to go down lighting with a Chicken
McNuggct in one hand and a large
order of McDonald's fries, publicly
acknowledged as the best fries in the
woi id. in t lie ol her hand.
But iu a( tuality, I have other
motives lor going to McDonald's.
Bevond theii exquisite lood (grade A,
top quality tuts ol beef) and first rate
service (Ihe Mi Donald's in LA helped
me pass in\ AP Spanish test), McDon
ald's will forever be .1 part of my rou
tine. When I am sitting at McDonald's,
life feels like its miles away. I have been
going to McDonald's to gel away ever
since I learned to ride a two-wheeler
and the routine has continued into
Stanford. Whenever I felt like things
were going wrong, I returned to what
was constant.
Nothing (an hurt me in those fake
plastii swivel < hairs under pale fluores
cent lights. In McDonalds, I ,1111 a mas
ter of my own destiny. Unfortunately,
it is the one part of my routine des
tined to kill me.
So I was thinking about this the
other day, and I realized that it's this
idea of routine that makes graduation
so strange and confusing.
Craduation is odd. You're excited
because in theory, you're ending school
and therefore ending all the suffering

associated with school. It's sad because
you say goodbye to all your friends. It's
annoying because you have to deal with
your parents taking more pictures of
you than can possibly be considered
healthy. It's dangerous because wearing
an all black gown on top of a wacky walk
costume (or lack of costume) and sitting
for four hours in 1 10 degree sun is just
plain stupid. And most of all, it's fright
ening because deep down inside you
know that when the final tassel is turned
and the final glass of champagne is
drunk, your routine will end, and a new
one must begin.
Stanford is a routine by the time
we are seniors. And just as it becomes
routine, we're asked to leave. Some
people have tried to fight the evil
entity known as graduation. They are
called Blake Harris (if you haven't
met him, he works in the Alumni
Association still denying that he ever
graduated. He is a Stanford land
mark). But inevitably, we must all
leave the green grass and palm trees
of this fabled institution to face a big
ger and more unpredictable world.
1 had just gotten used to Stanford.
I finally had it all figured out. And
even though I'm coterming next year,
my life at Stanford still feels like it's
ending. The routine I've come to
know and love won't work anymore. I
can no longer wait in a line and pick
up a loan check (wait, that's a good
tiling). I can no longer jaunt into the
CoMo expecting to find someone I
know. I can no longer go to Jack-In-
I he-Box four nights a week with my
roommate. I can no longer do the
things I have come to take for grant
ed.
College graduation isn't like high
school graduation. In high school grad
uation, we were all valedictorians so we
all had a chance to say goodbye. I
remember mine. I tried to write this
metaphysical soliloquy that stirred
souls with quotation after quotation
about friendship and endings and
ended up having more words by other
people than by me. Luckily, we have
the secretary general of the United
Nations to do that for us this year. So
instead, this is my valedictorian good
bye (because lord knows, I ain't winnin'
no valedictorian award with my grades
in CIV).
So to those of you reading this who
aren't graduating, find a job now
because it's never too early, lo Ger
hard Casper, no president will ever
Macarena quite like you. To those of you
