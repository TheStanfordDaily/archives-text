the Ne/hats because the surgeons
bring prestige and money lo the

Last week, Margolis was noti
fied by Dr. Mary Lake I'olan, the
gynecology and obstetrics chief,
that she planned to remove him
from the Ob/Cvn Qualitv ol Care
Coniniittee that reviews allega
tions against doctors.

Stanford said Thursday that it
will convene a "fact-finding" panel
to determine how peer-review in-
formation usually kept secret
ended up in newspapers.
Dr. Peter Gregory, chief med
ical officer of Stanford Medical
Center and Clinics, said Thursday
that Polan had stepped down and
other members of the committee
have also been asked to leave the
committee
Margolis, a Stanford clinical as
sistant professor, accused Polan of
pressuring him in five cases against

the Nezhats that were under re
view in 1996. She has denied the al
legation.
Since 1995,Camran Nezhat has
been director of the Stanford En
doscopy Center for Training and
Technology, which trains sur
geons in new, minimally invasive
surgical techniques. The Nezhats
practice privately in Atlanta and
Palo Alto.
In the past five years, 20 doctors
have expressed concern about the
Nezhats' surgeries and published
research.
Critics of operations the
Nezhats performed at Northside

Hospital in Atlanta in 1991 and
1992 say they surgeries were
"bizarre," "barbaric" and were
performed without sufficient pa
tient consent.
(aitics also claim the Nezhats
falsified data about the surgeries in
medical journals.
A malpractice case stemming
from the surgeries is pending. The
Nezhats have denied all the allega
tions.
They have many supporters, in
cluding 58 Stanford colleagues
who signed a letter supporting the
Nezhats that was published in the
Chronicle this week.
