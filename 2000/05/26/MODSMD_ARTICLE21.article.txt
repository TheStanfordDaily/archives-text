Clarifying the frosh T-shirt article
In Ben Alexander-Bloch's article on
I he Frosh T-shirt in The Daily yesterday
("Frosh T-shirts raise questions of diversi
ty"), I am afraid that things I had said to
tlie writer over the phone were taken out
of context. The article quoted me as say
ing "The [design] was so innocuous, we
would not have any of these problems
with fit]," which I did indeed say, but in
reference to the design submitted by Deb
orah Costa and 1.
Our design had featured a tree as part
of the Bond theme, with the text "The
Name is Ford . . . Stan Ford" and the 003
icon. The design that the Frosh council
was considering originally was based on
our Bond idea, but with the "Bond peo
ple" graphic drawn by the artist, whose
name I am afraid 1 do not know. The
"innocuous" design to which 1 referred
was the one with the tree in the place of
the "Bond people." I do not advocate the
first version of the "Bond people" shirt as
representative of the freshman class, or
"innocuous" in any way.
Since the litany of e-mails that incited
the article, Jonathan Akchin did
approach me. There was no intentional
disregard of our "intellectual property
rights," over the design on Jon's part.
Our contribution to the design had been
overshadowed by the Frosh Coucil's con
tact with the artist, whom they had
redraw the design several times. Jon has
made the effort to rectify the situation, of

which he had been previously unaware.
And after the article, it seems Deborah
and 1 have received even more recogni
tion than the artist who drew the final
design, and who has, even up to this
point, remained unnamed.
The latest T-shirt design reflects a
greater sensitivity to both ethnic diversity
and feminine body-image than the first,
while keeping the exciting and clever
Bond theme (if I do say so myself), and 1
am glad that it was brought to fruition.

BSU defends its speaker
The letter in The Daily calling for the
Black Student Union to apologize for
brining Minister Islnnael Muhammad to
Stanford University is a perceived attack
against the organization and an attempt
to define and limit the freedom of activity
of the BSU. While the BSU is in support
of dialogue involving issues of race and
improving relations between all commu
nities at Stanford, we will not compromise
the integrity of our organization and
modify programs to meet the desires and
preferences of campus populations whose
interests may be in conflict with ours. The
BSU does not see or feel any need to
apologize for inviting Minister Muham
mad to the campus.
As an official of the Nation of Islam

and assistant to Minister Louis Far
rakhan. Minister Muhammad is repre
sentative of a strong sector of Black lead
ership. Furthermore, as the teachings of
the Nation of Islam served as the ideolog
ical foundation for Malcolm X, Minister
Muhammad fulfilled a direct goal and
purpose in being highlighted as the
keynote speaker for Malcolm X week.
While I do not believe Mr. Gershow
attacks Minister Farrakhan and the
Nation of Islam from a malicious stand
point, I do believe his attacks come from
a misinterpretation or lack of under
standing of the true tenets of Islam and
the teachings of Minister Farrakhan. As
such, 1 believe it is necessary to dispel par
ticular falsehoods and to provide a con
text to Mr. Gershow's problematic "evi
dence" pointing to the Nation of Islam as
an "anti-Semitic hate group."
Mr. Gershow erroneously claims that
the "Secret Relationship Between Blacks
and Jews" attempts to provide justifica
tion for European persecution of Jews. In
actuality, from the start of the book, the
editor warns that the controversial mate
rial contained within the hook should not
be used as a "basis for the violation of the
human rights of another [people]." Both
Jewish and Black historians contributed
to this book that attempts to detail the lit
tle known factual evidence supporting
Jewish involvement in the Trans-Atlantic
slave trade. It's central purpose is to pro
vide a framework in which "to develop a
more equitable relationship between the
families of man."
Mr. Gershow mistakenly attempts to
draw a connection between the Million
Man March and the Black Holocaust
Nationhood Conference in 1995. At the
time of the Million Man March, khallid
Muhammad, the convener of the Black
Holocaust Nationhood Conference, had
been expelled from the Nation of Islam
for his inflammatory speech. According
to Nation of Islam officials, Khallid
Muhammad in no way serves as a repre
sentative for the Nation of Islam or Min
ister Farrakhan.
In typical fashion, quotes used by Mr.
Gershow to display Minister Farrakhan's
supposed anti-Semitic sentiments are
taken out of context and framed in a
manner to insinuate Minister Far
rakhan's contempt for other people.

Interestingly, Mr. Gershow's evidence of
Minister Earrakhan's "anti-Semitism" was
provided by the Anti-Defamation
League, a known interest group that has
a history of attacks against Minister Far
rakhan, the Nation of Islam and other
Black leaders and organizations. In fact,
Mr. Gershow has never attended a
Nation of Islam Mosque, has never lis
tened to an entire speech by anyone in
the Nation of Islam and did not attend
the keynote event that he claimed "legit
imized bigotry" on campus.
After a personal meeting with Marc
Gershow, I found that on a personal
level, I admired his sincerity, honesty and
concern for improvement between the
Black and Jewish communities. As it was
not the intent of the BSU to offend mem
bers of the Jewish community with its
hosting of Minister Muhammad, the fact
that particular members of the Jewish
community were offended signals a need
for dialogue. At the same time, however,
as co-chairman of the BSU, I must attest
that we will not be threatened or coerced
into compromising our stance on issues

as they relate to strengthening and uplift
ing the Black community at Stanford and
beyond.

with fit]," which I did indeed say, but in
reference to the design submitted by Deb
orah Costa and 1.
Our design had featured a tree as part
of the Bond theme, with the text "The
Name is Ford . . . Stan Ford" and the 003
icon. The design that the Frosh council
was considering originally was based on
our Bond idea, but with the "Bond peo
ple" graphic drawn by the artist, whose
name I am afraid 1 do not know. The
"innocuous" design to which 1 referred
was the one with the tree in the place of
the "Bond people." I do not advocate the
first version of the "Bond people" shirt as
representative of the freshman class, or
"innocuous" in any way.
Since the litany of e-mails that incited
the article, Jonathan Akchin did
approach me. There was no intentional
disregard of our "intellectual property
rights," over the design on Jon's part.
Our contribution to the design had been
overshadowed by the Frosh Coucil's con
tact with the artist, whom they had
redraw the design several times. Jon has
made the effort to rectify the situation, of

which he had been previously unaware.
And after the article, it seems Deborah
and 1 have received even more recogni
tion than the artist who drew the final
design, and who has, even up to this
point, remained unnamed.
The latest T-shirt design reflects a
greater sensitivity to both ethnic diversity
and feminine body-image than the first,
while keeping the exciting and clever
Bond theme (if I do say so myself), and 1
am glad that it was brought to fruition.

BSU defends its speaker
The letter in The Daily calling for the
Black Student Union to apologize for
brining Minister Islnnael Muhammad to
Stanford University is a perceived attack
against the organization and an attempt
to define and limit the freedom of activity
of the BSU. While the BSU is in support
of dialogue involving issues of race and
improving relations between all commu
nities at Stanford, we will not compromise
the integrity of our organization and
modify programs to meet the desires and
preferences of campus populations whose
interests may be in conflict with ours. The
BSU does not see or feel any need to
apologize for inviting Minister Muham
mad to the campus.
As an official of the Nation of Islam

and assistant to Minister Louis Far
rakhan. Minister Muhammad is repre
sentative of a strong sector of Black lead
ership. Furthermore, as the teachings of
the Nation of Islam served as the ideolog
ical foundation for Malcolm X, Minister
Muhammad fulfilled a direct goal and
purpose in being highlighted as the
keynote speaker for Malcolm X week.
While I do not believe Mr. Gershow
attacks Minister Farrakhan and the
Nation of Islam from a malicious stand
point, I do believe his attacks come from
a misinterpretation or lack of under
standing of the true tenets of Islam and
the teachings of Minister Farrakhan. As
such, 1 believe it is necessary to dispel par
ticular falsehoods and to provide a con
text to Mr. Gershow's problematic "evi
dence" pointing to the Nation of Islam as
an "anti-Semitic hate group."
Mr. Gershow erroneously claims that
the "Secret Relationship Between Blacks
and Jews" attempts to provide justifica
tion for European persecution of Jews. In
actuality, from the start of the book, the
editor warns that the controversial mate
rial contained within the hook should not
be used as a "basis for the violation of the
human rights of another [people]." Both
Jewish and Black historians contributed
to this book that attempts to detail the lit
tle known factual evidence supporting
Jewish involvement in the Trans-Atlantic
slave trade. It's central purpose is to pro
vide a framework in which "to develop a
more equitable relationship between the
families of man."
Mr. Gershow mistakenly attempts to
draw a connection between the Million
Man March and the Black Holocaust
Nationhood Conference in 1995. At the
time of the Million Man March, khallid
Muhammad, the convener of the Black
Holocaust Nationhood Conference, had
been expelled from the Nation of Islam
for his inflammatory speech. According
to Nation of Islam officials, Khallid
Muhammad in no way serves as a repre
sentative for the Nation of Islam or Min
ister Farrakhan.
In typical fashion, quotes used by Mr.
Gershow to display Minister Farrakhan's
supposed anti-Semitic sentiments are
taken out of context and framed in a
manner to insinuate Minister Far
rakhan's contempt for other people.

Interestingly, Mr. Gershow's evidence of
Minister Earrakhan's "anti-Semitism" was
provided by the Anti-Defamation
League, a known interest group that has
a history of attacks against Minister Far
rakhan, the Nation of Islam and other
Black leaders and organizations. In fact,
Mr. Gershow has never attended a
Nation of Islam Mosque, has never lis
tened to an entire speech by anyone in
the Nation of Islam and did not attend
the keynote event that he claimed "legit
imized bigotry" on campus.
After a personal meeting with Marc
Gershow, I found that on a personal
level, I admired his sincerity, honesty and
concern for improvement between the
Black and Jewish communities. As it was
not the intent of the BSU to offend mem
bers of the Jewish community with its
hosting of Minister Muhammad, the fact
that particular members of the Jewish
community were offended signals a need
for dialogue. At the same time, however,
as co-chairman of the BSU, I must attest
that we will not be threatened or coerced
into compromising our stance on issues

as they relate to strengthening and uplift
ing the Black community at Stanford and
beyond.
