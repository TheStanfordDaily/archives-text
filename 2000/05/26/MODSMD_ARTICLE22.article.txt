# FROM APATHY TO ACTIVISM
## Struggling against Med Center's waste disposal policy 
### JANELLE ISHIDA GUEST COLUMNIST 
How many times must activists be
runaround by campus administrators
before they realize that these people are
in place to uphold a system of status,
and that it is frivolous to act on convic
tions of social and environmental jus
tice?
SEAS (Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford) repeatedly met with
hospital administrator Paul Watkins
over the course of 12 weeks after the
submission of a proposal outlining our
demands for the hospital. Our primary

goal was to stop sending Stanford's
medical waste to an incinerator in Oak
land where it is burned and releases
dioxin and other toxic chemicals in the
midst of a predominantly low-income
community of color.
Things looked promising until two
weeks ago when the administration
decided that their contribution to dioxin
"was insufficient to warrant any
change." The hospital refused to accept
responsibility for their contribution to
what the EPA has classified as a human
carcinogen with a cancer rate as high as
1 in 100 people.
The audacity of their decision is

heightened by the Zero Dioxin Resolu
tion passed by the Oakland City Council
calling fora halt to the industrial pro
duction of dioxin via incinerators like
Integrated Environmental Systems in
Oakland â€” the "cleanest incinerator" in
the Bay Area. A great claim fora com
pany that failed to file an Environmental
Impact Report thanks to a backroom
deal with Bay Area Air Quality Manage
ment administrators and who, within a
five month period (Oct. 1999 to Feb.
2000), was cited for 27 incineration
related violations.
When I look back on this drawn-out
negotiation period, 1 think of one of the

parting comments an administrator
made in our last meeting. He thanked
us for not being, "too emotional" in the
presentation of our case. Good old ratio
nal Stanford students. Yet when 1 think
of the public hearings I attended in
Oakland and the residents 1 met who
live in the neighborhoods surrounding
the incinerator, 1 realized that the tactic
of rationality only goes so far.
If Oakland residents were here,
would the hospital be thanking them for
not being too emotional?
People talk about trying to make
changes from within the system, but, in
doing this, activists must be willing to

play the game of backroom deals and
suit-and-tie compromises. They may
strike a half-hearted deal with the
administration, but if they fail to demon
strate student power and challenge the
mentality of the structure which allows
these issues to be marginalized again
and again, we will find ourselves in the
same position a few years down the line.
That said, if you consider yourself to
be one of "those administrators" please
note that I do not intend to be thanked
again.
