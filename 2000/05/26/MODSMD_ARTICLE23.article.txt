# Faculty Senate approves new majors
## 
### JULIANA LIU STAFF WRITER 
The Faculty Senate voted unanimously to
approve new undergraduate degrees in Man
agement Science and Engineering and in Envi
ronmental Engineering yesterday.
The Management Science and Engineering
program will provide students training in the
fundamentals of engineering systems analysis
to prepare them to plan, design and implement
complex economic and technological manage
ment systems, the Committee on Undergradu
ate Studies said.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education
John Bravman said the major provides a choice
for students interested in management to focus
on either an engineering core or an economics
core.
Economics Prof . John Slioven said one of the
tracks in the program has courses overlapping
with the Economics major.

" 1 he new major should discuss with [the De
partment of] Economics to figure out how to
advise students," Shoven said.
I he Senate also approved the new degree in
Environmental Engineering. As a result, the
current Civil and Environmental Engineering
Department will be split into two departments.
The Committee on Undergraduate Studies
said the major is coherent, progressive and
well-structured and allows a reasonable level of
flexibility in course selection.
Two interdiciplinary programs were grant
ed reapproval by the Senate: African and Afro-
American Studies and Urban Studies.
Senators agreed that the African and Afro-
American Studies Program, under Linguistics
Prof. John Rickford, should continue. The pro
gram is currently under the umbrella of the Cen
ter for Comparative Study of Race and Ethnicity.
" I'm delighted to endorse this recommenda
tion," Education Prof.John Baugh said. "We've
had tremendous leadership in Rickford."

Rickford said that although they do not have
many students in the department, the group is
very strong. He said a fairly high proportion of
students are double majors.
Though the Senate voted to renew the inter
disciplinary major in Urban Studies, it ac
knowledged that the program depends very
much on the involvement of its director, Civil
and Environmental Engineering Prof.
Leonard Ortolano.
Ortolano joked that he was getting old.
"Without planning, finding a successor to
ensure a successful transition and continuation
of the program can be difficult," a Committee
on Undergraduate Studies report said.
Despite its success, the program needs more
funding to pay non-academic staff, such as pro
fessional architects, who are currently teaching
without compensation, Ortolano said.
"Right now, we have essentially an army of
volunteers," he said. "We can't list the classes as
required because they're taught by volunteers."
