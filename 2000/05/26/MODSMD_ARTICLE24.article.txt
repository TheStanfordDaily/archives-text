# E-mail volume climbs by 30 percent

Does your inbox seem even more flooded
this year than last?
E-mail use has gone up as much as 30 per
cent in the past year according to Chris Lundin,
director of Customer Assistant Information
Technology Systems and Services.
"I would say this is a normal rate," Lundin
said. "E-mail volumes have been going up each
year in a steady increase. 1 think it's neither
good nor bad."
Lundin cited Stanford's location in Silicon
Valley and the University's prowess in the sci
ences as two possible reasons for the increase in
e-mail usage.
"Also, I think people at Stanford are gener
ally interested in getting 'plugged in' to all sorts
of information," Lundin said. "It's not unusual
for someone to sign up on a mailing list they
hardly ever read and delete most of the time. In
addition, faculty and staff use e-mail attach
ments to update and communicate with stu
dents and other staff."

Lundin said e-mail volume increase is an in
dustry-wide phenomenon.
Institutionally, Stanford uses the Unix oper
ating system and Eudora as the application to
read e-mails. Stanford continues to use Unix
and Eudora largely because of the University's
long-term investment in and familiarity with
these mail servers.
"The University has, for many years, provid
ed Unix-based servers for faculty and students.
1 guess the main reason why we choose it over
other operating systems like Microsoft Ex
change Servers is because we were deep into
Unix mail servers by the time we had a choice.
We started to use Eudora back when it was
made in the University of Illinois in 1988, be
fore Microsoft, Netscape or any other browser
existed," Lundin said.
1 here are visible advantages of using Eudora,
and the University has no plans to change the
mail server system from Unix in the near future.
"I haven't heard any intent of changing op
erating systems. About two weeks ago the 'I love
you' virus hit campus and was specifically tar
geted to the Microsoft Exchange Server,"

Lundin said. "The University was in a way
spared by not having much dependency on Mi
crosoft systems. There are definitely viruses tar
geted toward Unix systems too, hut I think Mi
crosoft users have especially been a hard hit
these days."
Also, the Unix system allows students to
store large quantities of memory in their mail
servers.
"For example, Microsoft will give you a free
Hotmail account, but it can't store any memory
â€” you read them and delete them. Eudora on
the other hand, allows up to 50 megabytes of in
formation to be stored in each account we pro
vide as a university," Lundin said.
Microsoft does offer other forms of accounts
that can store e-mail.
"Whichever server you choose, you need the
electricity, adequate maintenance and other
bits and pieces to keep the system running
smoothly. We have to expend effort and ener
gy in either cases. You have to choose one, and
fora long time Stanford University had been
and is currently invested in the Unix operating
system," Lundin said.
