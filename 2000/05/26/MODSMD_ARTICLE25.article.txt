# Bisexual group plans dance
## 
### EILEEN CHAO STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's only student organi
zation specifically for bisexual
people, the Stanford Bi Scouts, is
hosting a dance at the Fire Truck
House this Saturday at 9:30 p.m.
Fhe organization was estab
lished at the beginning of spring
quarter but has already held sever
al events, according to senior Vic
Vadi, president of the Bi Scouts.
"We have had many successful
events this quarter, including
group dinners, bi-weekly meet
ings in the CoHo, movie nights
and a trip to a San Francisco bi
party," Vadi said. "But at the cul
mination of the year we wanted to
throw a big party for queer and
straight people alike."
Bi Scouts treasurer Cathy
Sakiniura, a senior, said she is ex
cited about the event, which is the
first major event the infant club
has
planned itself, she said.
"This new group has mostly or
ganized smaller, more informal
gatherings," Sakiniura said. "A
campus-wide party hosted by a bi
sexual group is a public affirma
tion of the identity chosen by
members of the group as well as a
way to interact with both queer
and straight communities."
Vadi agrees that this is a chance
for Bi Scouts to create unity
among the different groups on
campus.
"Bi Scouts is perfectly poised to
help reunite different communi
ties since we are one of the few or
ganizations under the LGBCC
umbrella that has more female

members than males," V'adi said.
"And our two top officers [V'adi
and junior Nurith Amitai] are
both international students."
The Hi Scouts had originally
envisioned throwing an end-of
the-year party by themselves. But
planning the social event became a
way for the LGBCC and the
Women's Center to work closely
together, according to Vadi, al
though Bi Scouts is doing most of
the planning.
"The current plan is to have the
dance floor on the first floor of the
Fire Truck House and a hangout
place on the second floor," Vadi
said.
"It will be open to the entire
Stanford community, and we es
pecially hope to target a diverse
crowd of people, especially those
involved with the Women's Center
and Stanford's queer communi
t>'-"
"Jamie," who was the disc jock
ey at the Genderfuk party, will
provide the music at this week's
event also.
Vadi said he feels the dance
would be a great way to make the
Fire Truck House a community
center for everyone, especially
for members of the queer com
munity.
According to Vadi, in the past
there was some concern because
some female and minority queer
people felt uncomfortable coming
to the Fire Truck House.
"The queer women at Stanford
have a more underground social
network and most LGBCC social
events tend to be dominated by
queer men," Vadi said. "1 hope
that by holding this event in con

junction with the Women's Center
will attract a lot more queer
women to this dance."
Sakimura said she hopes the
dance will also create more aware
ness of the queer community
among students.
"I hope that the dance can, as
we say, promote bisexual aware
ness in a non-threatening way,
that it can allow all members of the
Stanford community — gay, les
bian, bisexual, straight, transgen
derecl, questioning, queer — to
come together and have a good
time," she said.
As a pre-party event, Sakimura
will hold a "Pre-Nookie Cookie
Party" where there will be baked
goods and partially subsidized
take-out food.
The Friday night before the
dance, the LGBCC and the Black
Community Services Center will
be sponsoring "The Sculpted
Word," an evening of artistic ex
pression in the Papua New Guinea
Sculpture Garden in front of
Roble.
"This event is in honor of
spring," said sophomore Lyndon
Gill, event coordinator. "It is a re
turn to nature to thank her for the
seasons. It is a way to settle our
spirits before the summer. There
need not be an excuse for poetry
on a spring evening, that is like
asking why flowers must bloom —
you simple smile and be thankful."
The event, which will be held
from 8 p.m. to midnight, will fea
ture "spoken word, monologues,
storytelling, music, freestylin', po
etry and all the blossoms of artis
tic inspiration," according to a
press release.
