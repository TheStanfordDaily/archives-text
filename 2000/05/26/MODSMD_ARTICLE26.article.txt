This summer, lucky students
who have the time and money
to travel will visit places such as
(Aiba, India, Russia, Vietnam,
Mexico, Australia and Europe.
Many of this group will be
funded by grants from the Un

tunities program, while others
will travel with performance
groups such as the Stanford
Jazz Orchestra or Vintage
Dance Ensemble, and some stu

dently.
Ben Drucker, a sophomore,
will travel to Europe with the
Stanford Jazz Orchestra to per
form at the Montreaux Jazz
Festival in Switzerland, and the
North Sea Jazz Festival in Rot

bourg Gardens.
Christopher Cheng, a grad
uate student who has studied
martial arts in the U.S. for
about 13 years, will visit the
Shaolin Temple in China for
the third time.
"It's a tiny monastery in the
middle of China with approxi
mately 50 Shaolin Monks that
are arguably the best martial
artists in the world," said
Cheng. "The temple is located
on a mountain, so the view is
gorgeous, and the setting is
serene," he added.
Cheng said he looks forward
to visiting friends he has made
on earlier visits.
