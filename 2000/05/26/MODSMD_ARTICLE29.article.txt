## 
### BILL HANSON STAFF WRITER 
As many predicted, today's
N(AA liidi\ iclual (lhaiiipionships
final will be an all-Stanford affair,
as sophomore Marissa Irvin takes
on freshman Laura Granville.
"I'm really quite excited," said
Stanford head coach Frank Bren
nan. "It's an honor. It's the first
time in Stanford history that two
Stanford players are playing each
other for the NGAA Individual
title. Florida has done it once be
fore. I'm really proud of these
girls."
Although Irvin is the top
ranked player in the nation and
the tournament's top seed, her
path to the final has been a rocky
one, fraught with competitive
three-set duels.
Granville, on the other hand,
has cruised through her half of the
draw, downing highly-seeded op
ponents with ease.
Despite her national ranking of
third, Granville was seeded No. 9-
16 in this tournament. The NGAA
seeding committee, which seeds
players for the NGAA champi
onships, and the Intercollegiate
Tennis Association, w hic h releases
the national rankings, use differ
ent c riteria when ranking players.
This week, Granville has
proved that she deserved a higher
seeding.
Her tennis has been flawless
over five matches. In Wednesday's
third round, she upset fourth seed
and defending champion Lese
narova, 0-0. 4-0, 0-.'i. She followed
up her win over 112 .esenai ova with a
6-1, 0-1 pasting of USC star Jewel

Peterson later that afternoon.
In yesterday's semifinals,
Granville routed Georgia's Aarthi
Venkatesan, ranked fifth in the
nation, 0-1, 6-0.
"Granville's playing really well
and playing like an absolute
demon," Brennan said. "She plays
so many close games but wins
them all. That's why the scores in
her matches have been so lop
sided. She plays so well under
pressure. She's one of the most
mentally tough players I've ever
coached. Her nickname down
here is The Assassin.' "
Irvin, however, remains the
tournament favorite.
She will become a full-time ten
nis professional after this season
and knows that a victory in Malibu
would serve as the ideal culmina
tion of her collegiate tennis career.
At the 1999 Individuals, Irvin
reached the final before falling to
San Diego's Zuzana Lesenarova in
a third set tie-breaker.
Since then, she has participated
in several professional tourna
ments, achieving a professional
world ranking of 80th.
1 ler current collegiate record is
28-2.
Despite some dismal serving,
Irvin has displayed tremendous
resolve in reaching the final, fight
ing through several three-set
matches over the past five days.
"She's shown a lot of resiliency,
a lot of guts and determination,"
Brennan said. "But her serve is
still way off. Some of her matches
have been almost comical. She's
been saying, I can't believe I'm
