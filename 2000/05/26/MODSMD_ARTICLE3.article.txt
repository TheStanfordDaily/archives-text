## 
### ANITHA REDDY EDITORIAL STAFF 
1 or the first time, the I niver
sitv is involved in litigation
against a compam that, ii says, is
illegal!) using the "Stanford"
name.
I he general counsel's office
lost a motion it filed in the 9th
U.S. (lire nil (mm of Appeals
asking the coun to temporarily
block the use of the name "Stan
lord" bv Stanford Microdcvices.
an integrated circuit producer
based in Sunnyvale.
"We have reached name
change agreements with many
companies, Ihii this is the first
lime thai we have gotten to this
point in a lawsuit." said Shelley
llebert.lhe I niversit\\s director
of business development. "We've
been able lo settle prior lawsuits
without going into litigation."

According to I lebert. the com
pany has absolutely no relation
ship with the I nivcrsity. " l hey
just like the name," said Deborah
Xuimvalt. the I diversity's acting
general counsel.
I"he judge ol 9th I .S. ( ircuit
Court ol Appeals has already
found that the company chose
the name "Stanford Microde
\ ices" in a deliberate attempt to
associate the com
pany with the University,
/.umwalt said.
Precedent supports the Uni
versity's position, according to
/umwalt. Harvard I Diversity

recently won a similar injunc
tion forbidding the use of its
name against a healthcare com
pany, she said.
University officials are partic
ularly worried that investors will
mistakenly think the University is
associated with the company, be
cause Stanford Microdevices
began publicly trading its stock
on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange
yesterday.
"We're obviously concerned
about the idea that potential in
vestors would be misled into be
lieving that they're buying stock
from a company that has an en
dorsement from Stanford,"
Hebert said.
The University is not only

suing Stanford Microdevices for
its use of the name "Stanford,"
but also because the company's
logo includes an "S" resembling
one of the University's trade
marks.
"They were using a red and
white block 'S' as their logo that
was, shall we say, strikingly simi
lar to the University's," Hebert
said. The company has since
made minor changes to its logo,
she added.
Dan Jensen, communications
director for Stanford Microde
vices, did not return calls from
The Daily yesterday.
The University is currently ap
pealing the denial of its original
motion to block the use of the
name "Stanford" by the compa
ny. Zumwalt said no trial date has
been set yet and the trial is at leasi
a year away.
