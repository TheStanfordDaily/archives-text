Junior Joe Borchard is congratulated after a recent tour of the bags. Borchard and the No.
3 Cardinal begin NCAA Regional play at home tonight at 7 p.m. against Fresno State.
Baseball America's Fop 25 — Nos.
and 22, respectively. And Fresno
State, supposedly the'worst' team in
the regional, has been in and out of
the rankings all year.
Adding insult to injury, the Card
received the national No.B seed, es
sentially telling the team that a No.H
ranking, a 42-1 .'J record and a share
of the Pac-10 championship doesn't
mean that much.
That only serves to make Stan
ford's task tougher in the double
elimination mini-tournament,
which head coach Mark Marquess
considers a stepping stone lor his
veteran team.
"The great thing about having a
veteran team, a team that has been
to the College World Scries, and has
won the Pac-10 before, is that
they're not just happy to be here,"

said Marquess. "If we don't win this
Regional, they'll be very disappoint
ed. The first time you go to a Re
gional, they're all excited to have
just gotten that far. There won't be
lac k of motivation on our players
now. They won't lie satisfied unless
they win the Regional and the
Super Regional and go to the World
Series."
Fresno State (40-19), will be the
first to stand in the way of that goal.
I'lie Cardinal and the Bulldogs ac
tually faced off way back in January
in the season's first series, with Stan
lord taking two in a row before the
final game of the three-game set was
rained out.
Marquess is wary of the Bull
d< >gs" skill, and will start junior Jason
Young (7-0, :i.7S FRA) on Friday,
preferring not to take any c hances
on the mound.
"Fresno State's too quality an op
ponent, you can't play games and
pitch a third starter," Marquess said.
"The field is too strong and they're

100 g(x>d a team that you've got to
go with your best to try and beat
them."
The Bulldogs hope to tame Stan
ford's bats Friday with senior Shawn
I iannah, who went up against the
Card back in that January series.
Stanford battered Hannah for five
runs in four innings down in Fres
no, so at least the 6-foot-3
righthander won't be a complete
unknown.
()n the other side of the bracket,
which begins play at 3:00 Friday,
neither team will be an unfamiliar
sight fin Stanford fans, as both the
Crimson Tide and the Wolfpack
have made trips to Sunken Dia
mond for regionals within the past
couple years.
Karlier this season, Nevada actu
all\ handed the (lardinal its first loss
of the year, by a 4-1 score in Palo
Alto, liie two teams were supposed
to meet last week in Reno but had
the game rained out. Depending 011
what happens Friday, Stanford will

meet one of the two teams Saturday
whether they win or lose.
"We have not gotten a lot of in
formation on Nevada, but we do
know they are an older team," said
Alabama head coach Jim Wells.
"They play smart and they play well
together. They are very good de
fensively and they do not beat them
selves with mistakes. They are very
competitive and their top five hitters
are very patient hitters at the plate."
112 lowever the bracket shakes out,
Marquess has been around long
enough to know that funny things
can happen in regionals, especially
tough ones like this year's.
"As 1 always tell my team, this is
like a second season," Marquess
said. "What you've done during the
regular season doesn't really mean
anything. It'sa very short series, and
if you have a bad game or get a great
pitching performance or a ball
bounces or you walk a couple guys
and a guy hits a home run — you
can lose."
