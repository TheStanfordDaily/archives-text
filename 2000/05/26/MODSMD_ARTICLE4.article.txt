marched yesterday in support of the janitors' de
mands for higher wages in the ongoing contract
negotiations with their employers.

Action Coalition, working in conjunction with
Service Kmployees International Union Local
1877.
Marchers carried signs proclaiming "You can't
raise a family on $8 an hour!" and "Justice for
Janitors."
Anabel I bane/., an organizer from the South
Hay Labor Council, told the crowd, "In Silicon
Valley, millionaires are being created each day,
but <il the same time, workers are being pushed
into poverty."
The current union contract, which covers jani

tors throughout Silicon Valley and the Last Bay,
is set to expire on May 31. Local 1877, which rep
resents 5,500 janitors in the Bay Area, negotiates
a common contract for all of the companies that
employ its members.
file union is currently asking fora wage in
crease of between $1.25 and $1.32 per hour per
year for three years, a medical plan without
monthly payments and more annual sick or vaca
tion days.
The march began at the campus offices ol
American Building Maintenance, the subcon
tracting company responsible for janitorial ser
vices at Stanford, and Assoc. Vice Provost for Fa
cilities Chris Christoffeison. Small delegations of
students and janitors presented letters asking the
University to issue a statement of support for the
janitors' contract proposals for wage and benefit
