mands for higher wages in the ongoing contract
negotiations with their employers.

Action Coalition, working in conjunction with
Service Kmployees International Union Local
1877.
Marchers carried signs proclaiming "You can't
raise a family on $8 an hour!" and "Justice for
Janitors."
Anabel I bane/., an organizer from the South
Hay Labor Council, told the crowd, "In Silicon
Valley, millionaires are being created each day,
but <il the same time, workers are being pushed
into poverty."
The current union contract, which covers jani

tors throughout Silicon Valley and the Last Bay,
is set to expire on May 31. Local 1877, which rep
resents 5,500 janitors in the Bay Area, negotiates
a common contract for all of the companies that
employ its members.
file union is currently asking fora wage in
crease of between $1.25 and $1.32 per hour per
year for three years, a medical plan without
monthly payments and more annual sick or vaca
tion days.
The march began at the campus offices ol
American Building Maintenance, the subcon
tracting company responsible for janitorial ser

increases.
Union workers are prepared
to strike if the outcome of the ne
gotiations is not favorable, ac
cording to Alvaro Gomez, a
union organizer.
Christofferson was out of
town when the letter was deliv
ered. In an e-mail message to
The Daily, Christofferson
wrote, "Stanford University is
not the employer, and is not
party, legally or otherwise, to
the negotiation process. As such,
the University will not attempt
to intervene in the negotiations
themselves."
Students distributed fliers to
passing cars which read, "Stan
ford administration has refused
to take a stand for our jani
tors ... . Stanford can and
should support the rights of all
members of our community to
live in dignity."
The demonstrators assem
bled in the intersection of Cam
pus Drive and University Ave.,
where short speeches were
given by representatives from
the South Bay Labor Council,
members of the janitors' union,
faculty and students in SLAC.
Angeles Figeuroa, a Stanford
union janitor, asked, "Are you
ready to fight for the janitors in
this area and on this campus?"
She led the crowd in singing,
"No nos moveran (We shall not
be moved)."
Assoc. Prof, of Political Sci
ence Luis Fraga challenged the
idea that the interests of the
University and the janitors are
distinct.
"At a University, there's one
great responsibility â€” that is to
speak truth to power," Fraga
said. "We have to force the Uni
versity to tell the truth. The in
terests of the workers must be
accepted as part of the interests
of the University."
Freshman Lolita Roibal, a
member of the coalition, called
on the University to use its finan
cial resources to better the living
conditions of all its workers.
"I can tell you right now that
this University can afford to pay
these workers a living wage,"
she said. "Stanford pays $30,000
for one palm tree on Palm
Drive."
