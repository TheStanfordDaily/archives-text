### FIONA McNIFF 
Francis Ford Coppola spoke to a
parked house- in Clubberly Auditorium
last iiigbt as the final speaker in the
ASSU Speaker's Bureau series.
(loppola lias made his place in I lol
ly wood In directing multiple Academy
Award-winning films such as "Apoca
lypse Now," "Brain Stoker's Dracula"
and " I he (iodlather" trilogy.
Coppola discussed his desire from
an earlv age to bridge the gap between
art and technology. I le started out as a
theater major in college, hanging lights.
It was on ladders, suspended above the
-stage, that lie observed the art of direcl

ing and developed <i passionate desire
to direct plays.
Coppola's first directing experiences
were through the many plays lie pro
duced during his colfege days. Coppo
la's talent lor technology was then com
bined with his artistic desires in UCL\
film school.
"The marriage of technology and
creativity has always fascinated me," he
said. "Those two poles, they are so in
termingled in my mind."
In both college and film school, (lop
pola wanted to combine the art of film
with the technology of the future. It was
later, during the difficult filming of
"Apocalypse Now," that Coppola solid
ified his vision for the future of film.
"I was sitting there in the mud think
ing, there has got to be a better way than
this. The future of films is electronic,"
he said.
Soon after, Coppola joined with his
peers, George Lucas and Walter

Murch, and left the I lollywood scene to
move to San Francisco. There, they
formed an independent film company
to pursue their collective dream of a
new technology for film.
(loppola and his peers also wanted to
prevent themselves and their films
from being perverted by Hollywood's
obsession with money and power, he
said. He discussed how this corruption
pervades society today.
" This is an era where this is a nag
ging lac k of fulfillment. People tell you
all day long that you need to buy. Ad
vertising fuels everything, so it will
never stop."
Coppola cites the struggles to keep
himself and his films apart from .ill the
destructive forces of Hollywood and
today's society as one of his most diffi
cult challenges.
At the same time, Coppola thinks
that Hollywood is currently enjoying a
golden era in film. Movies such as "Boys

Don't dry" and "Klection," he said, are
phenomenal works of art. I he technol
ogy that George Lucas and others are
using is revolutionizing film.
In the future, Coppola said, "all
young people will he able to 111.ike art,
because that is what young people
should be doing." In fact, according to
Coppola, "all one needs to be an artist is
true honesty, love of beauty, intelli
gence and creativity."
Coppola also warned students that
"if you do beautiful work, if you do
good work, the money will come.
Money s not something you should
think about itself."
Coppola urged Stanford students to
seek fulfillment through their passions
and through art. I le ended his speech
with a few words of wisdom.
" I o not use your life for all it's worth,
to not risk evervthing, would be a waste
of a life, file less you live, the more you
die in the end."
