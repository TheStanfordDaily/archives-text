RFK killer seeks new trial
LOS ANGELES (AP) A day after being spurned by the
California Supreme Court, Sirhan Sirhan's lawyer went
to federal court to seek a new trial, saying Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy's killer was framed with false evidence.
Teeter filed a petition nearly 300 pages long in U.S.
District Court. It seeks a new evidentiary hearing and ul
timately a new trial.
On Wednesday, the state Supreme Court voted (5-0
not to re-examine Sirhan's case, saying his 1997 state
court petition was untimely and without merit.
Teeter's latest petition claims prosecutors covered up
evidence that as many as three weapons were used and a
second gunman was involved in the killing of Kennedy at
the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles in June 1968.
Sirhan, who is serving a life sentence, has been denied
parole 10 times.
He has repeatedly asserted his innocence, claiming he
was in a hypnotic state at the time of the shooting and that
a second gunman might have actually killed Kennedy.
