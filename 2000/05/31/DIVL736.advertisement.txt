Commonly Asked Questions
about reducing, reusing, recycling, buying recycled, and compoeting
Q Can books be recycled? I tried to sell my books back, but they didrit take them all.
A You could try to donate your books to a used bookstore. The problem with recycling books is the bind
ings Glue and other materials in the binding do not break down In the pulping process. The paper inside
the book is recyclable. If you tear off the binding or tear out the pages, you can recycle the paper in the
mixed paper bin and throw the binding In the garbage.
Q I noticed that when everyone moves out at the end of the year, there is a lot of good stuff in
the dumpsters. Does any one sort through them to remove the good stuff and give it to charity ?
A No! Anything that is placed In a garbage dumpster or a large debris box goes to the landfill and is buried
in the ground forever. The good stuff you are referring to are likely reusable items such as clothes, bikes,
lamps, furniture, plastic crates, hangers, etc. All reusable items should be taken to the yellow and blue
Goodwill Donation Trailers located in or near Wilbur, Rains, Roble, Governors Corner, and Row Mousing.
We have been diverting 48-50% of our waste all year long. Let s keep up the good work during move-out.
Please take time to take reusable items to the Goodwill Trailers and don't forget to put your newspapers,
school papers, shoeboxes, and empty cardboard boxes In the recycling bins!
Q I am interested in recycling
on campus, how can I get more
involved?
A There is an internship program at
Peninsula Sanitary Service and the
Stanford Recycling Center. We have 8
internship positions open. There are a
variety of areas and projects to be
involved with including resident hall
education, campus education, special
event organizing, and school recy
cling. If you are interested, contact
Julie Muir at the number or email
address below.
Q We use a large amount of pipette trays and other
disposable plastic Items in our lab. We can't recycle
them because they are not plastics #1 or #2. Is
there anything we can do to recycle them? It seems
like such a waste to throw them away.
A We are exploring the possibility of recycling this type of
plastic. In order to assess the volume, we need information
from everyone on campus as to what type of plastic items,
where the material is located, and how much volume is creat
ed on a weekly basis. We found a place that Is willing to accept
them, but we have to determine the logistics of collection and
delivery. Please contact Julie Muir at the number or email
below with this information.
