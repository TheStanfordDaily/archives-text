Got boxes?

It is the end of the year, you're finally done with all of your papers and
finals. Phew! But how are you going to move all your stuff for the
summer? You've hit the local grocery stores, priced out steamer trunks,
and you've even searched a few dumpsters on campus.
No worries! The Stanford Alumni Association is giving away free boxes to
student members of SAA. Stop by the Bowman Alumni House between
9am - 4pm on May 30 - June 2 or June 5-8. Five boxes per member.
Be sure to bring your SAA membership card or key chain.
