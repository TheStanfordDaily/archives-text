1972
Almost 30 years ago, the Daily published
an article titled: "Band Adds Women But
Stays 'Gross.'"
"Next year, for the first time, there will be
girls marching with the Incomparable Le
land Stanford Junior University Marching
Band.
"In an election last autumn quarter the
band voted overwhelmingly to retain its all
male membership. S(X)n afterward, howev
er, the University overruled the decision
and opened the 1972-73 band to women.
"What has been the reaction to 'the girls
in the band?' Sophomore Sigrid Salo, a
music major who plays the clarinet, main
tain that things are just the same:
" The band's got to be gross to be the
band and they haven't changed that,' she
says. 'My boyfriend says they're all scared of
me but I really can't tell.'
"Freshman Rick Pam agrees with her.
'Adding girls doesn't make a difference one
way or other,' he said. 'To me it seems the
same. Personally I think it's for the better.
An all-male band was getting outmoded.' "
The Bottom Line: Hordes of eager women infil
trate a key campus institution; in only 28 years,
the same would happen to The Daily, and
would be met with equal indifference.
