## Oregon law gives adoptees right to find birth parents 
### 
SALEM, Ore. (AP) — Perhaps Geena
Stonum's birth parents aren't even alive.
Or maybe they'd rather that she stay away
from them. But as of today, state law is no
longer keeping this adoptee — and thou
sands more — from finding out their true
parents' identities.
"1 have a wonderful family, but there's
still that piece that's missing," said the 41-
year-old Stonum, a mother of two.
"When you see people who maybe look
like you, you wonder if they're maybe
related to you."
Yesterday, Supreme Court Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor rejected an emer

gency request to delay Oregon's 1998
adoption records law from going into
effect.
That ended two years of court battles
begun by a group of birth mothers who
argued the new law violates the privacy of
people like themselves who gave up their
children for adoption and started new
lives.
The Oregon Health Division today will
begin processing applications of more
than 2,200 adoptees who already have
paid $15 to get their original birth certifi
cates.
Most are eager to know their parents'

identities, and many want to know more
about their medical histories. It could
take up to six weeks to finish mailing cer
tificates lo adoptees, the agency said.
While adoptees eagerly anticipated the
chance to learn about their past, Frank
Hunsaker, attorney fora group of six
anonymous birth mothers who had
fought the law, was bitter about the
removal of the lasi legal roadblock.
"My clients are extremely disappoint
ed and scared and even angry that their
rights have been ignored by Oregon's
voters and Oregon's courts," Hunsaker
said.

He said the adoption law, which gives
adult adoptees access to their original
birth certificates, violates an implied con
tract the women thought they had that
their identities would be protected and
that they would never be contacted by the
children they relinquished.
There are some birth mothers "who
haven't even told spouses or family mem
bers" that years ago they gave birth to
children they gave up for adoption, Hun
saker said.
The law first was approved by Oregon
voters in November 1998 after a cam
paign in which adoptees said that finding

their birth parents could help detect
potential health problems and, more
importantly, give them a sense of identity.
Last week, a state appellate court
refused to extend an earlier stay blocking
the law from taking effect, leaving the
U.S. Supreme Court as the only option
for opponents.
O'Connor, who fields emergency mat
ters from Oregon for the nation's highest
court, rejected the six anonymous birth
mothers' request to stay the law.
In 1997, the U.S. Supreme Court
refused to review a similar open adoption
records law from Tennessee.
