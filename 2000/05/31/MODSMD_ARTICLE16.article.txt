# Microsoft judge wields firm hand

WASHINGTON (AP) —
Thomas Penfield Jackson doesn't
hold back: When a Microsoft
lawyer once complained that t(x>
many excerpts of Bill Gates' video
taped deposition were being shown
in trial, Jackson quickly made his
feelings known. "I think the prob
lem is with your witness, not with
the way in which his testimony is
being presented,"he barked.
"I think it's evident to every
spectator that, for whatever rea
sons, in many respects Mr. Gates
has not been particularly respon
sive," said the U.S. District Court
judge, appointed to the bench by
President Reagan in 1982.
The occasionally outspoken
judge overseeing the historic
antitrust lawsuit filed against
Microsoft by the government and
several states is no stranger to high
profile cases.
In 1994, the tall, white-haired
judge ordered then-Sen. Bob Pack
wood, R-Ore., to turn over his
diaries to the Senate Ethics Com
mittee investigating sexual harass
ment charges against Packwood.
The journals' contents ultimately
proved to be Packwood's undoing.
Earlier Jackson, now 63, presid
ed over the cocaine possession trial
of former Washington Mayor Mar
ion Barry. He publicly criticized
some jurors in the case — telling a
Harvard University audience he
thought "four jurors were deter
mined to acquit regardless of the
facts." And he said the government
had put on a very strong case. His
comments prompted Barry's futile
attempt to have Jackson disquali
fied from sentencing him.
Jackson also presided over the
trial of former Reagan White
House aide Michael Deaver, who
was convicted of lying under oath
about whether he engaged in inap
propriate lobbying of one-time
White House associates.
Over the years, Jackson has had
an uncomfortable relationship with
the press although he has dealt
with reporters frequently in the
Microsoft case, even sharing a cab
with several on one occasion.
He grew up in the Washington
suburb of Kensington, Md., the son
of a prominent lawyer, and attend
ed both private and public schools,
even serving at one point as editor
of his high school newspaper,
before moving on to Dartmouth
College and later, Harvard Univer

sity law school.
From 1958-61, he served in the
Navy aboard a destroyer in the
Mediterranean and then joined his
father's law firm upon his return to
Washington.
No case has matched the visibil
ity of the current one: the govern
ment's push to break up software
giant Microsoft.
The Justice Department called
for splitting Microsoft into two
competing companies after Jack
son ruled in early April that the
company had violated several pro
visions of federal antitrust law.
"He's the perfect example of
why the Constitution gives federal
judges life tenure — that provision
is designed to give them a great
degree of independence, and
Judge Jackson is clearly demon
strating that independence in this
case," said Rich Gray, an antitrust
expert with a law firm in Califor
nia's Silicon Valley.
Steve Houck, the former lead
attorney for the suites, called Jack
son "an independent thinker"
known to surprise people.
"He's been very innovative from
the beginning in terms of the pro
cedures he put in place" in the trial,
said Houck, now a private attorney
for Reboul, Mac Murray in New
York.
To help speed the nonjury
Microsoft trial, Jackson limited
each side to 12 witnesses and had
those witnesses submit their direct
testimony in writing. He has tried
to move the case along even
though some earlier antitrust cases
have taken years to complete.
During the 78-day trial, Jackson
gave attorneys for both sides great
leeway to conduct their examina
tions. He only occasionally prod
ded them to speed things up.
Some critics said that Jackson's
handling of the case revealed a
pro-government slant, but Gray
disagreed. He noted that the judge
could have been much harsher
toward Microsoft, particularly
when the company was questioned
about the credibility of videotaped
evidence that it introduced — and
later yanked. "On two days
running, Microsoft put evidence
in front of the judge that had
been altered in a way that they
didn't reveal," Gray said. "If he
was hostile to Microsoft, he could
have made a big deal about that"
in his two-part ruling.
