BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — His
fresh face marred by a fat lip.
Rep. Rick Lazio was nominated
by the Republican Party yesterday
to battle Hillary Rodham Clinton
in the nation's most closely
watched Senate race.
To the cheers of more than
400 delegates and hundreds of
other supporters, La/.io — a little
known Long Island congressman
who entered the race after New
York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
withdrew because of prostate can
cer — was declared the unani
mous pick of the party's state con
vention.
With the "Rocky" theme blar
ing from loudspeakers, Lazio, 42,
took the stage to declare, "I am
the underdog in this race." He
promised to take his "message of
hope, opportunity and responsi
bility" across the suite.
"My opponent is better
financed and better known. She
comes to New York with the sup
port of every left-wing
interest, from Washington insid-'
ers to the Hollywood elite," Lazio
told the delegates.
"Bring 'em on. Because when
it comes to representing the
needs, concerns and values of the
people of New York, I have one
advantage she'll never have — I
can be myself. I am a New York
er."
While not criticizing Clinton by
name, Lazio accused "the opposi
tion camp" of practicing the "pol
itics of division .... It is a bleak,
angry place, built of fear. And I

will not go there."
Clinton campaign spokesman
Howard Wolfson said Lazio
"offered the people of New York
recycled insults and rhetoric that
doesn't match his record. Time
and time again Rick Lazio has
voted against New York's work
ing families in Washington.
"Hillary Clinton has been run
ning an inclusive campaign since
day one and fighting for children
and families for 30 years," Wolf
son added. "New Yorkers will
always be able to count on Hillary
to stand up for them in the Sen
ate."
Lazio arrived in Buffalo as a
wounded warrior. He tripped
Monday during a Memorial Day
parade on Long Island, splitting
his lip. He needed eight stitches.
Republicans, expecting a
tough race against Clinton and
seeking to dispel any notion the
stumble could be a metaphor for
the GOP campaign, made light of
the wound.
"It'll be the first of a few," state
GOP chairman William Powers
said.
Lazio also joked about it, say
ing in his speech: "I've heard of
pounding the pavement, but this
is ridiculous. I want a rematch."
Nine months ago, Gov.
George Pataki persuaded Lazio to
suspend his fledgling Senate cam
paign in favor of Giuliani. But
then on May 19, the mayor with
drew. Pataki and other Republi
can leaders quickly rallied around
the four-term congressman.
