LIMA, Peru AP) — Defeated opposition
candidate Alejandro Toledo called yesterday
fora march of four million protesters in Lima
to block President Alberto Fujimori's inaugu
ration.
Speaking to foreign journalists, Toledo said
he is planning the protest for Julv 26 — two
days before the presidential inauguration,
which takes place on a national holiday — "if
Fujimori is still around on that date," he said.
Calling Fujimori a dictator who was fraud
ulently re-elected Sunday, Toledo spelled out
a three-pronged strategy to keep the president
from extending his slay in power fora third,
five-year term.
Criticism of Fujimori continued to grow
outside Peru as well. However, the Clinton
administration backpedaled from an official
statement Sunday in which Fujimori's victory

was described as "invalid." State Department
spokesman Philip Reeker limited himself to an
expression of deep regret.
But U.S. officials also said the Clinton
administration is expected to loosen official
ties with Peru. A State Department official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
administration is reviewing its policies toward
Peru in international lending organizations.
Toledo said street protests that have gone
on throughout this Andean nation would con
tinue and build into one massive march for
four million designed to paralyze Lima. He
said he would travel the country to prepare for
the march, speaking with university students,
unions and other organizations.
Another way Toledo said he plans to keep
Fujimori from being sworn in is by persuading
;it least (i 1 of the Congress' 120 members to

boycott the body's opening session on July 28.
He said Fujimori cannot be sworn in without a
majority present in Congress.
Fujimori's supporters won only 52 seats in
the new Congress, but Toledo charged that
Fujimori's political allies have begun offering
as much as $50,000 to some of the congress
men elected on Toledo's ticket to get them to
join Fujimori's governing alliance.
"They want to reach 61 or 62 so they will
have a majority," he said.
Toledo said he also was dispatching repre
sentatives to Washington, Europe and other
Latin American nations "to explain our posi
tion and the need to annul this election."
The goal, he said, was to have a new, clean
election called and if necessary seek a transi
tion government" in the interim. He said that
would require Fujimori to step down.
