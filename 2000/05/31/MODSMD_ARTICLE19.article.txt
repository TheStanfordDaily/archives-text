# Israel gets first chance in 40 years for U.N. representation

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Yester
day Israel accepted an invitation to tem
porarily join a U.N. regional group,
which gives the Jewish state the chance to
be represented on U.N. bodies in New
York for the first time in four decades.
The invitation from the U.N. regional
group of European, North American and
other countries on Friday capped a
lengthy campaign led by the United
States, Israel's main ally at the United
Nations.
U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke

expressed delight that one of the Ameri
ca's priorities during the Clinton adminis
tration's last year had been fulfilled.
"We were told it couldn't be done, but
here we are to celebrate it," Holbrooke
said. "It is a historic step forward in the
elimination of a huge injustice."
The campaign to bring Israel into the
world body's fold will continue, because
this week's invitation was limited only to
the regional group in New York — not in
Geneva, Vienna, Nairobi and Vienna,
where the United Nations also operates.

But Holbrooke said "New York is the
mothership" of U.N. operations, and
Israel's admission into the European
group was the critical hurdle.
Israel's U.N. Ambassador Yehuda
Lancry said his government was happy
with its admission to the West European
and Others Group.
"It's very important, taking into con
sideration that we have been excluded for
40 years, that we were considered a sort
of pariah of the international communi
ty," Lancry said. "This is a new chapter

we are opening with the United Nations
and the family of nations."
Secretary-General Kofi Annan — who
had increasingly voiced concern about
Israel's isolation at the United Nations
and worked behind the scenes to correct
it — was glad that WEOG had issued the
invitation, according to his spokesman,
Fred Eckhard.
Under U.N. rules, the regional groups
decide the 10 rotating seats on the Secu
rity Council and other U.N. committee
assignments. Israel was the only U.N.

member that was not part of a regional
group, because Arab nations have
blocked its admission to the Asian Group
— where it belongs geographically.
Israel's membership in the European
group is only temporary, and Israel must
continue to try to join the Asian group,
said the Netherlands' U.N. Ambassador
Peter van Walsum.
" The arrangement is for four years,
and then we will reconsider," said van
Walsum, the European group's chair
man.
