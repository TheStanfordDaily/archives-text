# Hennessy presents budget
## 
### DEENA SKOLNICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Over the the next academic
year, the I niversity will he both
earning and spending more
money than in 1999-2000, acord
ing to a budget plan tor 2000-'Ol
presented by I'rovost |ohn 1 len
nessy at the Faculty Senate meet
ing Thursday.
Increases in both income and
expenditures has been a recurring
theme of recent University fi
nances. Over the four-year period
from 1990-2000, total revenues
have increased 7.4 percent while
total expenditures have increased
8 percent.
Die 2000-01 proposal is no ex
ception to this trend, as I lennessy
projec ted a 4.4 percent increase in
revenue from 1999-2000, as well as
a 5.2 percent increase in spending.
Despite a larger increase in
spending than in income, Ilen
nessv predicted that the L niversity
would still have a surplus of $27.3
million, clown from last year's
$38.4 million surplus.
The consolidated budget
overview from 1999 showed that
total revenues from 1990 were
$ 1.098 billion. Most <>1 Stanford's
income comes from sponsored re
search and student income. Total
expenditures were $1,582 billion,
with most of the money going to
the salaries and benefits of the fac
ulty, staff and administration.
Next year, allocation of finances
w ill be similar, although I lennessy
proposed a few changes. The
largest changes are in the amount
of money earmarked for housing
assistance due to the "dramatic rise
in cost of living in the Bay Area,
Hennessy said. "This increase has
meant that we have had to devote
more resources to housing and
salary, leaving fewer dollars for
new initiatives."
In addition to increasing hous
ing funds, Hennessy allocated
nearly one-quarter of the Universi
ty's income to the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, with other
significant portions of the money
going to a systems' reserve and ad
ministrative costs. Over half of the
proposed project 112 und will be spent
on new construction on campus.
Hennessy's budget was based
on a list of six major priorities. He
dedicated 42 percent of the base
general funds to faculty and staff
compensation to create a stronger
merit-based program.
The graduate housing subsidy
was increased by $ 1.8 million to $5
million in order to improve hous
ing assistance programs. 1 lennessy
proposed increasing graduate stu
dent stipends to 6 percent and
awarding Terminal Graduate Reg
istration status after nine quarters
of residency.
He also proposed increasing fi
nancial support for undergradu
ate education and improving fi
nancial aid packages.
Under Hennessy's plan, anoth
er major portion of Stanford's
funds would go to improvements
in the academic and administrative
infrastructure and continued in
vestments in administrative sys
tems such as student information
and human resources.
Hennessy's final proposed fi
nancial priority was the allocation
of additional funds to research

support.
"We first tried to address the
most critical issues: an enhanced
undergraduate financial aid pro
gram, additional graduate student
housing support, and a better staff
salary program," 1 lennessy said of
his proposals. "Beyond that, we
dealt with what appeared to be the
most critical priorities and those for
which the schcxil or unit did not
have alternative funding sources."
Hennessy cited several future
c hallenges to Stanford's finances,
including the need to increase en
dowment support for the budget
and cost pressures from the local
economy. He mentioned specifi
cally that faculty and staff salaries
will continue to be under pres
sure clue to increasing housing
costs.
An additional challenge to Stan
ford's financial situation is the need
to provide permanent support for
many of its new programs, includ
ing Stanford Introductory Studies,
Undergraduate Research Oppor
tunities and financial aid.
"Meeting the challenges will re
quire continued good financial
management, new approaches to
housing assistance, and a signifi
cant development program," I len
nessy said.

Demolition of part of the Press Building on Santa Teresa Street will commence next week. A 48,000-square-foot lab
oratory for Mechanical Engineering will replace it. According to Jean Barnes, a facilities project manager, the Press
Building was chosen as the site of the new laboratory because of its old age and its proximity to the various engi
neering programs. The former tenants of the building, Event Services, Information Technology Systems and Sen/ices,
the News Service, and the Learning Lab have moved to various locations around campus. The News Service and
Event Services permanently relocated next door to the Press Annex in mid-April.
