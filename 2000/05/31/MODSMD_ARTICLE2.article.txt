### DEENA SKOLNICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Over the the next academic
year, the I niversity will he both
earning and spending more
money than in 1999-2000, acord
ing to a budget plan tor 2000-'Ol
presented by I'rovost |ohn 1 len
nessy at the Faculty Senate meet
ing Thursday.
Increases in both income and
expenditures has been a recurring
theme of recent University fi
nances. Over the four-year period
from 1990-2000, total revenues
have increased 7.4 percent while
total expenditures have increased
8 percent.
Die 2000-01 proposal is no ex
ception to this trend, as I lennessy
projec ted a 4.4 percent increase in
revenue from 1999-2000, as well as
a 5.2 percent increase in spending.
Despite a larger increase in
spending than in income, Ilen
nessv predicted that the L niversity
would still have a surplus of $27.3
million, clown from last year's
$38.4 million surplus.
The consolidated budget
overview from 1999 showed that
total revenues from 1990 were
$ 1.098 billion. Most <>1 Stanford's
income comes from sponsored re
search and student income. Total
expenditures were $1,582 billion,
with most of the money going to
the salaries and benefits of the fac
ulty, staff and administration.
Next year, allocation of finances
w ill be similar, although I lennessy
proposed a few changes. The
largest changes are in the amount
of money earmarked for housing
assistance due to the "dramatic rise
in cost of living in the Bay Area,
Hennessy said. "This increase has
meant that we have had to devote
more resources to housing and
salary, leaving fewer dollars for
new initiatives."
In addition to increasing hous
ing funds, Hennessy allocated
nearly one-quarter of the Universi
ty's income to the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, with other
significant portions of the money
going to a systems' reserve and ad
ministrative costs. Over half of the
proposed project 112 und will be spent
on new construction on campus.
