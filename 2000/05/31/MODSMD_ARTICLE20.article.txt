## The 						Stanford Daily Daily editor in chief bids a fond farewell 
### 
Published Since IfWI

It's 5 p.m. in The Daily newsroom,
which, generally, means rampant chaos.
Stories we've been trying to track down
all day suddenly come in (all at once),
the productionist is yelling at the top of his
lungs for photo sizes, most oi the editors start
their nightly ritual of begging for "dinner on
The Daily," the phone — dormant all day —
seems to magically start ringing oil the hook,
and at least one of our newsroom computers
crashes.
But that's not the case today. Things have
been slowing down around here lor the past
week, as we prepare to close up shop and as
many editors, myself included, are getting
ready to step down.

Leaving The Daily to do other things that
I should have been doing (i.e. classwork,
socializing, sleeping) is actually a remarkably
difficult thing to do. The Daily and the peo
ple who work here have been a part of what
1 do and who I see every day for the past four
months, and that's not something that's easy
to let go of. Although I have grand plans to
return to news beat writing next fall and to
act in some sort of advisory capacity for the
new staff, I do know that nothing I've ever
done or will do at The Daily can compare to
these past lour amazing months.
In this space of time, I've witnessed the
staff transform and re-design the paper,
expand coverage to A and B sections, create

a new Innovation section, put out artistic
photo essays, step up the paper's graphical
elements. . . It's a long list, filled with incred
ible things, and when I think about it, I'm
reminded of why reporting, writing, dis
cussing and creating are at the heart of my
passion for journalism.
What will I miss about the job? a friend
recently asked me, as I was thinking back on
the volume.
"Well," I responded. "1 wouldn't quite
know how to put that into words."
But I'll give it a try now.
I'll miss walking through the office's dou
ble doors, seeing the newsroom alive with
activity, as staffers are engaged in discussing a

particular story, working with writers, editing
pages, or fighting over the T.V. remote. I'll
remember tackling the tough issues, under
standing the various angles there are to every
piece, and responding to readers — all while
presenting The Daily's side of the story. 111

and simultaneously fiddling with sentence
