I'd be the first to admit I love pop
music. The pre-adolescent sultri
ness of Britney Spears. I lie vocal
acrobatics of Christina Aguilera.
The intensely hummable, ingrained,
inescapable hooks of Backstreet and
N'Sync.
Not that I'd ever buy their (.I)s, but if
1 happen to see their video on MTV, I'll
sing along with them, loudly and proud
>>'•
And, recently, I've found myself
enamored of the

Bloodhound Gang,
whose latest song,
"Bad Touch," reminds
us all to "do it like they
do on the Discovery
Channel.''
So imagine my sur
prise when 1 found out
that my latest find had
previously recorded a

song called "Yellow Fever."
"I said I needed her to do and her Jo
do my laundry / 1 knew she needed a way
to stay legally within the country / She
was made in Taiwan 1 said I'm O.K. with
that / )iist promise me you'll never try to
eat my cat/ Chinky chinkv hang bang 1
love you/Chinky chinky hang bang I
know you love me too cause I ride my
slant-eyed slope like a brand new
Kawasaki/Oh me chinky she's so kinky
got me hot like Nagasaki."
The song, originally recorded for the
group's "One Fierce Beer Coaster"
album, goes on to extol the virtues of
Asian women who can be "blindfold
ed . . . with dental floss" and lie "like an
oriental rug."
Thankfully, Geffen Records decided
to pull the song before mass production,
but various student and civil rights
groups across the country have recently
joined in protesting the Bloodhound
Gang.
Turns out the Bloodhound Gang isn't
new to controversy, as the censors at
MTV (did you know MTV had censors?)
asked the Bloodhound Gang to remove
images of gay bashing from their "Bad
Touch" video before it aired.
And the band has also recorded songs
with such descriptive titles as "I Wish 1
Was Queer So I Could Get Chicks" and
"The Evils Of Placenta Hustling."
Jimmy Pop, lead singer of the Blood
hound Gang, said that, "the whole song is
about how I want to bang an Asian chick.
In my own way, I'm saying that I like
Asian chicks."
Okay.
Honestly, I don't think that Jimmy Pop
is Satan personified, and if the song is

never released, there's not much more
that I could probably persuade the Blood
hound Gang or Geffen Records to do.
But I really believe that here in Cali
fornia, on our liberal college campus, we
forget how casually racism is perpetuated.
Senator Mc( lain was just being patriot
it. )inuny Pop was just being outlandish
and fiumy. Hate e-mail is just a stupid
annoyance. It seems there's always an
excuse for racism.
Now, I don't want this column to be a
GET YOUR ASS INTO THE STRUG
GLE! war cry, and it would be awfully
hypocritical for me to write snidely about
student apathy. But I also don't think
casual, racist remarks should be accept
able.
As an Asian-American, I sometimes feel
pressured to hold my tongue. Live up to
the model minority myth. And, yes, 1 did
get good SAI scores. And, yes, I was co
valedictorian of my high school. But how
many of these stereotypes do we really
feed upon?
When things are going well and don't
affect us directly, it's so easy to stay quiet
and not rock the boat. But we all — and I
do mean ALL — shouldn't be afraid to
make a little noise once in a while. Espe
cially when things are going well and
don't affect us directly.
Political correctness has gotten a bad
rap. It is, after all, immensely easy to make
fun of overly sensitive New Age language.
But people aren't as nice and enlightened
as we'd like to think. Believe me, I grew
up in the Midwest.
In a Rolling Stone interview, Jimmy
Pop said, "It would probably be an Asian-
American that would hate a song about an
Asian girl and me wanting to strew her.
You never hear about a Jewish guy
complaining about the fact that we're
making fun of some black guy's teeth.
You never hear a black guy complaining
because we're making fun of some Jewish
guy's nose. So we just dismiss all that."
So, Mr. Pop, I'd just like to speak out
and let you know something. My name is
Adrian, and I'm an Asian-American. And
I'm complaining that you're making fun
of some Jewish guy's nose. And I'm com
plaining that you're making fun of some
black guy's teeth.
And, Mr. Pop, if you think it's okay to
exploit ignorance for whatever reason, I'd
like to complain some more.

Adrian is a graduating senior in English with

like to thank everyone who has ever been
involved with his long and storied Stanford
career, (iuys, it's been 2ToFu!
