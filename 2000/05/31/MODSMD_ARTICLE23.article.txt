"Bootleg" freshman T-shirt not bootleg
at all
1 am dissatisfied with the editorial <>l Fri
day, May 2(> ("Bootleg freshman I -shirt
design causes controversy"). While 1 realize
tli.it editorials reflect opinion, The Daily's
editorial hoard seems out of step with the
facts of the controversy.
The editorial reads, "It seems that the
Krosh Council must have had compelling
reasons not to try to salvage the original
James Bond design." The design was actu
ally discontinued because the Frosh Coun
cil did not want to request a fourth drawing
from the artist, Flaine Chao, who had
already submitted three separate, rejected
drawings. Instead of revising the design,
the Counc il issued a new T-shirt with a car
toon ish, dancing tree. The compelling rea
son for switching gears was time, not poli
tics.
I am not selling a "bootleg freshman I -
shirt," nor is the shirt design the property
of the Frosh Council. Flaine received com
pensation for her original design, which
featured all white characters. ()nly the orig
inal design is the property of the Frosh
Council. Flaine owns the new, more inclu
sive design and granted me the right to use
it on a T-shirt. My private enterprise has
nothing to do with the Council, as I made
clear in my original advertisement.
The T-shirt I am currently selling was
drawn and designed by Flaine Chao, and
based on a James Bond theme. I lie phrase
"Ford .. . Stanford," was coined bv Anna-

Christina Douglas and Deborah Costa.
Douglas and Costa informed me of this
after 1 had produced the shirts, and Dou
glas has since told me that she is satisfied
with m\ effort to compensate their contri
bution. I did so in the name of business
ethics, not legal responsibility.
Now that the facts are firmly established,
I can comfortably state my opinion without
fear of misleading the readers. In my opin
ion, replacing a whitewashed shirt with a
cartoon tree masks racial problems on c am
pus. The editorial accused me of not con
sulting with students who were offended by
the first shirt. However, I produced this
shirt in response to such criticisms, not in
retaliation to them.
1 am not above reproach in this whole
misunderstanding. I explicitly told Daily
reporter Ben Alexander-Bloch that I com
mitted an error in judgment. I used the
mystique of semi-legality and controversy
to sell a perfectly legitimate and represen
tative shirt. However, I contend that this
was my only mistake. All critics of the shirt's
subject matter retracted their statements
after having seen the new design. The orig
inal designers are satisfied and, despite the
In st efforts of a few c ritics, the shirts are sell
ing marvelously.
The vast majority of freshmen wanted
this shirt reproduced and are voting with
their wallets. I have conciliated all
aggrieved parties that have come to me
and I continue to apprise my uninformed
critics. I am disappointed that The Daily's
editorial board was so quick to attack a

legitimate act of entrepreneurship, creativ
ity, cultural sensitivity and c lass pride.

No split in Civil & Environmental
Enginnering Dept.
Friday's Daily article ("Faculty Senate
approves new majors") on the Faculty Sen
ate meeting, in reporting on the new
undergraduate degree in Environmental
Engineering, states that, "As a result, the
current Civil and Environmental Engi
neering Department will be split into two
departments."
This was not discussed at the Faculty
Senate meeting, and is not correct. The
Civil & Environmental Engineering
Department will remain a single depart
ment. The only change discussed and
approved at the Faculty Senate meeting
was that this department will now offer an
undergraduate BS degree in "Environ
mental Engineering," in addition to the BS
degree offered in "Civil Engineering."
Your erroneous statement will be shock
ing to the faculty in the School of Engi
neering, unsettling to all the staff and grad
uate students in the Civil 8c Environmental
Engineering Department and irresponsi
bly misleading to those undergraduates
who are interested in civil or environmen
till engineering.

Freshman T-shirt should not be an issue
If there is going to be continued argu
ment over this T-shirt issue, then I must
throw my two cents into the ring. First
things first, I just want everyone to know
that we are arguing over a T-SHIRT. Not
wages for janitors or better food, but a T
shirt. Normally, I would think we all might
want to spend a little more time outside
enjoying our last two weeks here at Stan
ford as opposed to writing about some
thing such as this. But, alas, we are.
I think Jonathan Akchin is not in the
least wrong in terms of selling "unofficial
2003 shirts." I know of at least dozens of
people who have labeled the official shirt as
"unoriginal," "uninspired," etc., and this
shirt is something different. No longer is
this issue a question of lack of diversity 011
the shirt, for anyone who has seen the new
James Bond themed shirt can attest to the
fact that diversity is represented.
What the issue could be is that because
of his ties to the Frosh Council, does he
have the right to sell the shirt "unofficially"?
The answer is yes people. Look, you have
two choices in regards to this subject. You
can either buy the shirt, or not. If you
don't, then the shirt shouldn't be an issue
to you. If you do, then you probably like
the shirt anyway.
Living in the same dorm as Jon Akchin,
I've found him to be a very socially aware
and sensitive individual, especially when it
comes to issues such as diversity, ii the man
wants to sell shirts that a majority of the
people are in favor of, then let him sell his
shirts. Then maybe we can stop this squab
bling and enjoy the weather outside.

Daily lacks coverage of grad student
draw, fails important constituency
As one of the many graduate students
who read this paper regularly I was
appalled to see that there was no coverage
of the graduate housing lottery results
from this past weekend.
In one weekend nearly 1.000 graduate
students were told that they have no place
to live next year, yet our student paper feels
this isn't newsworthy? The lives of these
evicted students have just been dramatical
ly altered; searching fora nearby affordable
apartment on $ 13,000 to $20,000 a year is
stressful, time consuming and still is the
biggest problem graduate students face at
Stanford.
I'm frustrated because we all know what
the top dorms for undergrads were from
the housing draw (last week's front page
story),and we get to hear about all of the
students who are upset with not getting the
dorm of their choice, yet nothing was writ
ten about those who have NO housing!
This past year, as chair of the Graduate
Student Council (GSC), I was interviewed
often by Daily reporters who, for the most
part, were unaware of the issues facing
grad students. I had no problems with try
ing to educate them as many are unaware,
but this particular lapse in coverage is
ridiculous. For six GSC meetings this year
(out of about 40), we had four different

beat reporters attend and, for the most
part, each had to be re-educated as to what
grad issues were being discussed, yet
almost every undergrad senate meeting
was attended by a reporter.
Also, during the precedent-setting joint
meeting between the GSC and the Faculty
Senate last month, the important dialogue
we had with the faculty leaders and admin
istration was reduced to "grievances," and
most of the article went to misquoting Pres
ident Gerhard Casper.
I'll not list all of my complaints here, but
do you need to till the Opinions page so
badly that you resort to poor reporting?
The verbose Sports writers fill several pages
daily. Shouldn't the News section devote as
much in-depth reporting on the people,
groups and events that are affecting our
lives here?
1 know this paper has had trouble get
ting grad students to write for it, but this
doesn't excuse it for not being aware of the
largest, most negative, annual event for
grads. If you don't think grads read your
paper, it's mostly for this reason — irre
sponsible reporting.
So you can make your paper look as
fancy as you want, and grads will continue
to browse its finer parts like Piled Higher
and Deeper, but until you become more
responsible to your constituencies and
establish more integrity in your writing,
The Daily will remain a lower quality paper
written for the undergrad world at Stan
ford.

Sleep survey uses flawed data
The Dean of Students report on the
time-use study conducted in the Sleep and
Dreams class suites that "students slept 7.(5
hours per day, not including naps." The
May 25 Daily article on the study states the
"baffling" finding that "the average Stan
ford student sleeps eight hours a day."
Both of these statements ignore the fact
that the study design led to a significant
overestiination of the time that students
actually spend asleep.
In the study, each student (including
myself) recorded their activities for the
week by filling out an online form where
each blank represented a 15-minute peri
od. Each subject selected from a list of 26
activity categories for each blank. Since
"sleep, including naps" was the only sleep
related option available, the time that the
study considers "sleep" is actually the time
asleep plus the time laying in bed trying to
get to sleep, the time awake in the middle
of the night, and the time laying in bed in
the morning awake. However, time spent
in any of those non-sleep categories will not
help a person achieve their sleep need.
Also, the students were encouraged to
submit their data all at once fora particular
day instead of recording the sleep times in
the morning when it is fresh in their minds.
So it seems likely that their memories may
have been pushed a little bit by social desir
ability — the natural tendency for self
report data to be biased in the direction the
subjects believe the researchers want or
expect. Since these students were all in a
class that specifically advocated that they
get more sleep, it makes sense that their
reported figure would, on average, be
somewhat higher than is correct.
Finally, there are reasons to doubt the
applicability of these results to the "average
Stanford student." The class' professor was
constantly encouraging students to get
more sleep. This class met three times a
week for the weeks before, during and after
the study. If anyone was following his
advice for at least the period they kept
hearing it, then the data will represent a

higher figure than you would expect from
the general student population. Also, there
is a selection bias since students who
already considered sleep more important
to their lives were more likely to enroll in
the class than the "average Stanford stu
dent."
While it is true that the subjects report
ed 7.0 hours of "sleep" per day, it seems
onlv reasonable to conclude that the actual
amount of useful sleep the average Stan
ford student gets is much less than that.

Campus publications should cover
Annan's speech, encourage debate
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan was
named Stanford's 2000 Commencement
Speaker at the suggestion of students. He
already spoke at the Notre Dame Com
mencement, where he sharply criticized
the failure of the United States to support
the United Nations. Presumably, his Stan
lord talk will follow the same lines. I le may
be right, but the subject deserves serious
discussion. Nevertheless, despite my
appeal, there are no plans to debate his
remarks. This is a serious omission, as is the
lack of any regular courses at Stanford on
the United Nations.
I regularly receive two copies of certain
U.N. documents. I forward one set to the
Oovernment Document division of Green
Library, and I thought it would be appro
priate to send the second set to the relevant
member of the Political Science Depart
ment. The chairman of that department
said he would inform me who the appro
priate member would be, but I never
received that information.
The spring-summer issue of the excel
lent Stanford Journal of International
Relations announces that its next issue will
be devoted to 'Transnational Organiza
tions," including the United Nations. The
journal is put out by the International Rela
tions program, which, like the more spe
cialized International Policy Studies, is
directed by Judith L. Goldstein of the Polit
ical Science Department.
1 hope someone from those programs
will be covering Annan's speech. I plan to
forward the second copy of the U.N. doc u
ments to Prof. Goldstein. Ihe Daih and
The Stanford Review should cover the
event. This would be a c ritic al analysis, not
the formal coverage we can expect from
the University's official Stanford Report.
Whether you like the United Nations or
not, and many Americans don't, it is a
major player in today's world and deserves
more methodical attention than it receives
at Stanford University.

More on Arab-Israeli conflict
I am writing in response to khaled Sala
ma's letter entitled "Stanford Egyptian
Association officer responds to Arab-Israeli
debate." As a member of a family who lived
in Egypt just 35 years ago, but was forced
out due to excessive discrimination and
anti-Semitism, there are some misconcep
tions on which 1 would like to comment.
Firstly, the comments regarding the
Yom Kippur War in 1973 are out of line. Is
he attempting to suggest that Israel
attacked Egypt on the 10th day of
Ramadan? I hope not. Egypt and all the
Arab countries attacked Israel on Yom Kip
pur, when we spend most of the day in
prayer service and fast for 25 hours. There
is no question about this.
Salamathen contradicts himself. First, he

brings several quotes from Israeli officials
following the 197.'} Yom Kippur War to
demonstrate that they thought Arab coun
tries were still stronger than Israel militari
ly. Second, he claims that Israel threatened
Egypt and dared them to try and take the
Sinai. Why would Israel threaten Egypt if
they believed Egypt was stronger? II Egypt
was stronger, why wouldn't Israel negotiate
a peace? This does not make sense.
One of those claims is obviously wrong,
and given that he gives viable quotes to
back up the former it must be that the lat
ter claim is false. Israel never threatened
Egypt and never dared them to move
against Sinai. Egyptian President Nasser
never called Israel before the Yom Kippur
War and offered peace in exchange for the
land. In fact, it was Israel that offered to
give back every single inch of land cap
tured, including all of east Jerusalem aside
from the old city, and every single Arab
country flatly rejected it.
In fact, just three months after the 1967
war, Nasser signed the Khartoum Resolu
tions, in which the following was written,
"This [referring to the recapturing of'terri
tory] will be done within the framework of
the main principles by which the Arab
States abide, namely, NO peace with Israel,
NO recognition of Israel, NO negotiations
with it, and insistence on the rights of the
Palestinian people in their own country"
(article III).
Shortly before the war, even before
Israel had captured any Egyptian land,
President Nasser stated, " The battle will be
a general one and our basic objective will be
to destroy Israel" (in a speech on May 26,
1967). Does this sound like a leader inter
ested in peace?
Regarding Salama's final comment, I
believe inserting random facts to portra\
Israel as a renegade nuclear nation is sim
ply preposterous. Israel is always in danger
of attack. Within hours of withdrawing
from the Lebanese security zone, militant
Lebanese citizens stood at the border
fences and shouted across to the Israeli sol
diers, "We kicked vou out of our country
and next we will kick you out ofvours. We
are going to kill you."
Israel is the country on the defensive.
He assumes that because the Arab states
have signed a nuclear ban treaty, then they
must have no nuclear weapons, and they
must have no intentions to attack Israel.
Many of these same Western experts also
assume that many Arab states have or are
developing nuclear weapons (i.e. Iraq,
Iran).
So Salama's letter is yet one more
attempt to cast Israel as an aggressive
oppressive state, when in reality, the sur
rounding Arab countries have repeatedly
made it their goal to totally annihilate the
state of Israel.
