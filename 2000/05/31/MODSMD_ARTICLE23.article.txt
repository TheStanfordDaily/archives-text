"Bootleg" freshman T-shirt not bootleg
at all
1 am dissatisfied with the editorial <>l Fri
day, May 2(> ("Bootleg freshman I -shirt
design causes controversy"). While 1 realize
tli.it editorials reflect opinion, The Daily's
editorial hoard seems out of step with the
facts of the controversy.
The editorial reads, "It seems that the
Krosh Council must have had compelling
reasons not to try to salvage the original
James Bond design." The design was actu
ally discontinued because the Frosh Coun
cil did not want to request a fourth drawing
from the artist, Flaine Chao, who had
already submitted three separate, rejected
drawings. Instead of revising the design,
the Counc il issued a new T-shirt with a car
toon ish, dancing tree. The compelling rea
son for switching gears was time, not poli
tics.
I am not selling a "bootleg freshman I -
shirt," nor is the shirt design the property
of the Frosh Council. Flaine received com
pensation for her original design, which
featured all white characters. ()nly the orig
inal design is the property of the Frosh
Council. Flaine owns the new, more inclu
sive design and granted me the right to use
it on a T-shirt. My private enterprise has
nothing to do with the Council, as I made
clear in my original advertisement.
The T-shirt I am currently selling was
drawn and designed by Flaine Chao, and
based on a James Bond theme. I lie phrase
"Ford .. . Stanford," was coined bv Anna-

Christina Douglas and Deborah Costa.
Douglas and Costa informed me of this
after 1 had produced the shirts, and Dou
glas has since told me that she is satisfied
with m\ effort to compensate their contri
bution. I did so in the name of business
ethics, not legal responsibility.
Now that the facts are firmly established,
I can comfortably state my opinion without
fear of misleading the readers. In my opin
ion, replacing a whitewashed shirt with a
cartoon tree masks racial problems on c am
pus. The editorial accused me of not con
sulting with students who were offended by
the first shirt. However, I produced this
shirt in response to such criticisms, not in
retaliation to them.
1 am not above reproach in this whole
misunderstanding. I explicitly told Daily
reporter Ben Alexander-Bloch that I com
mitted an error in judgment. I used the
mystique of semi-legality and controversy
to sell a perfectly legitimate and represen
tative shirt. However, I contend that this
was my only mistake. All critics of the shirt's
subject matter retracted their statements
after having seen the new design. The orig
inal designers are satisfied and, despite the
In st efforts of a few c ritics, the shirts are sell
ing marvelously.
The vast majority of freshmen wanted
this shirt reproduced and are voting with
their wallets. I have conciliated all
aggrieved parties that have come to me
and I continue to apprise my uninformed
critics. I am disappointed that The Daily's
editorial board was so quick to attack a

legitimate act of entrepreneurship, creativ
ity, cultural sensitivity and c lass pride.

No split in Civil & Environmental
Enginnering Dept.
Friday's Daily article ("Faculty Senate
approves new majors") on the Faculty Sen
ate meeting, in reporting on the new
undergraduate degree in Environmental
Engineering, states that, "As a result, the
current Civil and Environmental Engi
neering Department will be split into two
departments."
This was not discussed at the Faculty
Senate meeting, and is not correct. The
Civil & Environmental Engineering
Department will remain a single depart
ment. The only change discussed and
approved at the Faculty Senate meeting
was that this department will now offer an
undergraduate BS degree in "Environ
mental Engineering," in addition to the BS
degree offered in "Civil Engineering."
Your erroneous statement will be shock
ing to the faculty in the School of Engi
neering, unsettling to all the staff and grad
uate students in the Civil 8c Environmental
Engineering Department and irresponsi
bly misleading to those undergraduates
who are interested in civil or environmen
