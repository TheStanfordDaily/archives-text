# FROM APATHY TO ACTIVISM
## Stanford must set an example for sustainability 
### LAUREN DIETRICH GUEST COLUMNIST 
Green building. Environmentally sound
design. New age recyclable materials
instead of old growth wood. Rooftop pho
tovoltaic panels, passive solar heating, natu
ral light, thermal mass in concrete floors ...
Methods that may be slightly more expen
sive upfront, but save millions on energy
bills throughout the life of the building.
With proper design, tfie new energy
technologies available today pack back
their additional construction costs within
the first three months of building opera
tion.
1 he most efficient methods are still quite
steep for most projects, but they will come
down in price over time, especially if
demand and hence, production, increase.
The best technologies do not have to be
used in every building right away, but we
need to begin turning our steps in the right
direction.
(Completely ignoring the economic lx*n
efits, my main argument could easily be that
green building is the preferable method of
construction because it saves the planet
from further desecration on many levels.
Trees are preserved and ore is not mined

when contractors choose to use polylxiard
and recycled steel tor a structure's lame.
I he energy a well-designed green building
saves reduces the lossil fuels consumed by
power plants already racing to pump out
adequate amounts of electricity.
I could also argue the benefits of green
building tor those who have to spend time
in the structures. Inhabitants of green
buildings are more productive in the natu
ral light, increasing sales tor extra profit.
There have even been studies showing that
with all other variables equaled, children
who learn in a building lit with natural light
perform better than those in artificially lit
classic xiins.
Are you convinced? Seems like a great
plan all around, right? Green building
keeps the earth clean, saves the operators
money and makes inhabitants happy. So
why is green design catching on so slowly?
Why have we, as a wealthy institution, not
embraced this new technology?
1 am writing this column to increase
awareness among students, faculty and
staff about the opportunities awaiting our
University in the field of green design.
Stanford is in a unique position.
As a renowned University with a large
endowment, we are assured that business

and education will continue as usual for
many years to come. We can afford to
invest in green building now and can rest
assured that we will undoubtedly reap the
benefits in the long run as operation costs
decrease. I he current stand of the plan
ning committee is to build as green as pos
sible within the parameters a project.
Design guidelines give the consultants
some direction, but Stanford has failed to
take a position staling the exact level of effi
ciency expected.
For green design to be completely effec
tive, all the parties working on a project
need to be integrated for the design pro
cess. I lie c urrent system of separate bud
gets for the planning office and facilities
management lead to confusion, last minute
changes and incredible losses. I he Univer
sity designed the new graduate student
housing on Campus Drive (near Mir
rielees) with energy efficiency in mind,
planning to use gas furnaces for heating.
Yet, when construction was behind
schedule and the contractors were over
budget $2 million, the builders scrapped
the furnaces in favor of electrical floor
board healing, a method that is so ineffi
cient it's almost below the (California mini
mums for energv efficiency, ft saved a little

money right away, but has since cost the
University millions in energy bills.
However, Stanford does deserve some
praise for its design efforts. Currently in the
making is an extremely efficient green
building fin the new Dosen (Center at
jasper Ridge in the Foothills. I he plan calls
for recycled materials, passive solar heating
and photovoltaic cells for energy. Several
people are working very hard to make the
construction a success.
1 here is also the possibility of a green
design firm, Siegle and Strain, winning the
bid to construct the new Student Services
( '.enter on the current site of I lie Bridge.
Stanford should seriously consider hiring
the experienced environmental builders to
make a showcase green building.
The U.S. Green Building Council has
c reated a Leadership in Energy and Envi
ronmental Design (I TED) scale to set iden
tical stindards for green designers across
the country.
I propose that Stanford require all new
const ruction i<> be I.FED certified silver.
I his would be a monumental step for
green design, attracting much attention to
the efforts of our University.
And since ii would be economically ben
eficial for us in the long run, I think we

need to nab this opportunity fast! The
head architects may be hesitant to man
date .1 green design policy because there is
no precedent of comparable scale, and evi
dence of payback success is just starting to
amount.
But nothing's ever commendable if you
don't take a risk and put all your efforts
into something you believe in. I sincerely
believe in the benefits of green design and
hope I've provided enough evidence to
convince all people affiliated with Stanford
University.
I he sooner we act, the more energy and
materials we save, the more money we
eventually don't have to spend and the
happier more workers become.

Stanford should seriously consider hiring
the experienced environmental builders to
make a showcase green building.
The U.S. Green Building Council has
c reated a Leadership in Energy and Envi
ronmental Design (I TED) scale to set iden
tical stindards for green designers across
the country.
I propose that Stanford require all new
const ruction i<> be I.FED certified silver.
I his would be a monumental step for
green design, attracting much attention to
the efforts of our University.
And since ii would be economically ben
eficial for us in the long run, I think we

need to nab this opportunity fast! The
head architects may be hesitant to man
date .1 green design policy because there is
no precedent of comparable scale, and evi
dence of payback success is just starting to
amount.
But nothing's ever commendable if you
don't take a risk and put all your efforts
into something you believe in. I sincerely
believe in the benefits of green design and
hope I've provided enough evidence to
convince all people affiliated with Stanford
University.
I he sooner we act, the more energy and
materials we save, the more money we
eventually don't have to spend and the
happier more workers become.
