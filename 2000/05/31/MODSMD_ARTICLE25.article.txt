## 
### JULIANA LIU STAFF WRITER 
I'or about two do/en Stanford student athletes,
this summer holds the promise of ()lvmpic glory.
I Ik 1 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney will begin
Sept, IT) and last until Oct. 1. 1 hose hoping to com
pete in Sydney will face pre-Olympic trial competi
tions in early summer. Stanford students will com
pete in sports including gymnastics, diving, swim
ming, fenc ing, soccer, volleyball, track and field and
waterpolo.
Not surprisingly, many students said their train
ing this quarter has been especiallv intense.
"Studying and training is difficult to juggle, be
cause, oddly enough, ii is not just time management
and discipline you have i<> deal with but also the en
ergy and rest factor," junior Misty flyman said.
1 Ivman hopes to compete in women's swimming.
"You t ini set aside time to study, but, if you can't
stay awake because you are more tired from a work
out than you expected, there is reallv not much vou
can do except rest and come back to it later," she
said.
Some athletes, like ()l\ inpics swimming hopeful
John Waters, a freshman, said the) are ac tually tak
ing a slightl\ heavier academic workload than usual

to add balance to their lives.
()ther athletes are taking fewer units this quarter.
According to junior Steven Brown, a swimmer,
the University is remarkably flexible in accommo
dating students with difficult athletic schedules. For
example, students with early trial competitions can
take a minimum of eight units.
Athletic Advisor Verity Powell said some students
who wanted to take eight to ten units wanted to
make sure that they would not he jeopardizing their

ability to participate in NCAA events, which require
more units.
"1 am only taking 14 units, which is only three
classes," Women's Diving hopeful Kim Powers, a ju
nior, said. "However, I just happened to pick classes
that are killing me, so 1 am actually probably spend
ing more time on school this quarter than usual."
Powers said she had considered stopping out this
quarter but decided not to. Her Olympic trials are in
June.
"1 am loving being at Stanford light now and I
wouldn't trade that overall experience for anything,
even to train for the Olympics," Powers said.
Junior Adam Messner, a swimmer, agreed. He
said school and training complement each other.
"1 think that all Stanford students, not just ath
letes, devote almost all of their extra time to life-en
riching activities outside of the classroom, so I don't
really consider myself [to be] that much different,"
Messner said.
Powell said the Olympic closing ceremony will
occur five days after fall quarter starts so students
will be able to come back for classes.
But, for those who need or want to be at the
Olympics until the very last day, stopping out may
be the best alternative, University Registrar Roger
Printup said.

Senior Jason Katsampes, who will compete in
gymnastics, said he plans to to stop out in the fall. He
will re-register in winter and spring quarters.
Printup explained that it is up to the faculty to de
termine whether they are willing to have students
start their classes sometime after the beginning of
the quarter. Since Axess is available on the Web, stu
dents can register for classes on time, he said.
"A day or two after the closing ceremonies, I will
return to Stanford, as excited as ever fora great se
nior year," Messner said. "I just hope that my teach
ers are as willing as I will be to get the ball rolling
again, 112 am sure that will include a substantial, yet
manageable load of make-up work and a few office
hours."
Powell and Hyman agree that University faculty
are supportive in helping students achieve their aca
demic and athletic goals.
"I have been lucky enough to have a wonderful
advisor, Dr. [Judith] Goldstein, who is working with
me one-on-one in my major doing independent
study," Hyman said. "This has helped my schedule
immensely."
Especially when that schedule is, as sophomore
Olympic swimming hopeful Jessica Foschi puts it,
"just eat, sleep and swim."
