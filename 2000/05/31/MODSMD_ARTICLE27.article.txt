# Hospital continues incinerating waste
## 
### PETER STAIR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Officials at the Stanford Hos
pital announced earlier this
month that they would continue
their practice of incinerating
medical waste in ()akland.
An immediate transition
would he too costly and mini
mally effective, the) said.
The decision came after a
year of protest, mostly by Stan
ford students, that the hospital is
contributing to high cancer
rates in the lower-class, niinorit\
neighborhood near the inciner
ators. 1 lie plastic materials in
the medical waste release diox
in, a well-known carcinogen,
when burned.
Junior Inn Ly, a member of
Students for Environmental Ac -
tion at Stanford who worked on
the campaign, said students
protested alter hearing from
People Unified For A Better
()akland, a citizens' group.
"A certain portion of the
waste by law needs to be inciner
ated, but there's a lot of waste
that can be disposed of through
other processes," Ly said.
"Health care is meant to help
people, but this is a situation
where medical waste is sent to
Oakland where it's harming
people."
Members of SEAS proposed
last year that the hospital find a
healthier means of disposing of
its waste, specifically recom
mending that it use high-pow
ered microwaves instead of in
cinerators to sterilize the waste.

Hospital officials agreed to
investigate the possibilities and
met regularly with students dur
ing the year, while SEAS orga
nized meetings at the Medical
School, held several teach-ins,
put on guerrilla art theater per
formances in White Plaza and
started a continuing postcard
campaign directed at Louis Sak
sen, vice president of general
services at the hospital.
Melody Jackson, spokesper
son for the hospital, disputed
the assertion that Stanford's pol
lution is significant.
(siting a report put out by the
Bay Area Air Quality Manage
ment District, she said, "The
burning of medical waste con
tributes to less than two-tenths
of a percent to the total dioxin
released in the Bay Area â€” of
that, Stanford Hospital con
tributes 15 percent."
"We have taken a very close
look at shifting to microwave
processing," she continued,
"but we have found that we can
achieve virtually the same level
of dioxin reduction by simply
removing our syringes. The
hospital is currently looking into
a process for doing so."
Students were disappointed
with the hospital's conclusion,
questioning its true commit
ment to long-term change and
the pertinence of the dioxin re
port.
It is difficult to measure how
much dioxin the incinerator is
actually releasing into the neigh
borhood. Ly said.
Junior Janelle Ishida added
that the neighborhood is suffering
regardless of how relatively small
Stanford's dioxin contribution is.
"The hospital has complained
that it's expensive to retrain its
workers to sort the waste properly,"
said Ly. But retraining is inevitable
if there is going to be some long

term change, he claims. "It might as
well happen sooner," he said.
"I wonder if they were just sort
of stringing us along," Ishida said.
"At every meeting they'd bring up
a complaint that prevented them
from moving forward. . .now its
the end of the year."
Jackson emphasized that the
hospital is "continuing to investi
gate a varietvoflong-terin alterna
tives to incineration."
"We're going to be keeping the
pressureoll, lettingthein know that
we haven't gone away," Ishida
added.
