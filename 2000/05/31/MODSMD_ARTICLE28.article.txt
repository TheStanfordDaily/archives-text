# Students search for summer housing
## High demand for on-campus residences causes major shortage, problems for students 
### MEGAN KNIZE STAFF WRITER 
With the end of spring quarter a week
away, 321 students who have committed to
summer jobs, internships and classes on
campus and in Silicon Valley have found
themselves without on-campus summer
housing.
I his year, 924 students — 31 percent
more than last year — applied for on-cam
pus summer housing. Those who didn't re
ceive assignments are now part of a long
waiting list.
" The apparent reason for the increase
in demand for campus housing is an in
credibly tight off-campus housing market,"
said Keith Guy, associate vice provost for
1 lousing and Dining Services. Guy is spear
heading efforts to increase housing options
for students. "Landlords are able to
charge very high rents and many seem un
willing to offer short-term rentals," he said.
Many students are finding Guy's de
scription to be true.
"My roommate and I weren't particu
larly concerned with summer housing until
we discovered that apartments off-campus
aren't available over the summer," said

sophomore Michael Hughes, who is unas
signed but has a job in a lab on campus.
"We literally called every advertisement
listed in the Palo Alto Weekly and came up
empty." Hughes said that he would like to
live on campus, because "I have no car and
no money, and off-campus housing re
quires both."
While students who registered for sum
mer classes were given housing priority,
Guy and his staff are trying to find room for
the other students. Housing Assignment
Services Manager Todd Benson said 603
students have been assigned to housing.
"This is the first summer we have had
this kind of surge in applications and
unmet demand from undergraduates,"
C »uy said.
Housing Services has identified possible
solutions. One is to shift some conference
groups to make space in the Row Houses.
Another solution is to combine summer
camps to free up other residence hall space
or use "wholly vacant apartments in gradu
ate housing."
The University has just two weeks to
make these decisions.
"I'm cautiously optimistic that these ef
forts will result in our ability to meet the
lion's share of the unmet demand from
those students who applied for summer
housing by the published deadline," Guy
said.
Uist Wednesday, Hughes sent an e-mail
about the lack of on-campus summer hous
ing to the sophomore class list. The letter

encouraged students to "flcxxl ResEd with
your complaints." He said the response to
his e-mail, both from students and from
Guy himself, has been very positive.
In the letter, Hughes also argued that
the University should open another dorm
to accommodate students.
"Summer camps for cheer leading and
yearbook and debate are important only to
a point," Hughes wrote. "I would argue
that full-time students should be more im
portant to the University."
"1 think the University should open up
another dorm ... or subsidize off-campus
housing and provide transportation to
those students," said sophomore Peter
Trinkle, who will take 12 units this summer
and work as a lab assistant in the Electrical
Engineering Department. Trinkle is one of
the lucky students with on-campus hous
ing.
But other students, who were promised
housing as part of their employment this
summer, are still waiting to find out where
they will live. Mike Sego, a freshman, who
will work in Residential Computing this
summer, is one of those students on the
waiting list.
"Clearly, there's not enough housing,"
Sego said. "But it's important that there's
enough housing for people working on
campus, or going to sch(x>l here. Other
people who want to live here for the cheap
housing have other options."
Maulik Shah, another sopho
more without summer housing, said
that after reading the e-mail from
Hughes, he was "hopeful that [the
administration] would listen to us."
He added that he's disappointed in
the lack of options for students who
are unassigned.
Shall, who will work at Stanford
Informatics, said that he applied for
housing after the housing deadline
on April 30. I le's hoping to sublet a
graduate student's apartment.
"Students who applied after that
deadline will be more difficult to ac
conunodate, even though we will be
exploring options to find housing
for them as well," Guy said.
According to Benson, students
living in Florence Moore Hall this
summer can expect to pay $920 for
the summer, plus the cost of a meal
plan, and students in Mirrielees will
pay $1,046 for summer lodging.
According to posted messages on
the Stanford newsgroup su.market,
one bedroom in a twobedr<x)in/one
bath apartment in Redwcxxl City or
Mountain View costs between $000
and $700 per month, plus utilities.
