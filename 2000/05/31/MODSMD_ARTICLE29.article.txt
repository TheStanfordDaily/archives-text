ASSU communication and finances.
Thirty to 40 students attended the meeting,
said ASSU Senator Tai-Li Chang. ASSU Presi
dent-elect Seth Newton was also present.
Although several key issues surfaced during
the proceedings, "what was really stressed was
diversity around campus," (lhang said.
Students suggested creating a forum to ad
dress rac ism and the separation of ethnic com
munities on campus, according to the meet
ing's minutes.
Chang also said he thought "students want
to see more tenured faculty of color."
Among the other topics raised at the meet

ing was "empowering the student groups in
general," Chang said.
According to the minutes, students ex
pressed a need for training for organizations
and their leaders and noted a lac k of coordina
tion between student groups. They also ex
pressed a need for widespread publicity for
groups.
Students suggested an ASSU group coordi
nator assist graduate and undergraduate
groups."
Another hot discussion item at the meeting
was the improvement of student-faculty-ad
ministration communication and a stronger
student voice in administrative affairs.
The students called fora "student voice in
University decisions, including non-main
stream student voice," said the minutes. Stu
dents also wanted to hold monthly meetings

with the administration to address student con
cerns.
An ASSU newsletter was suggested as one
way to improve communication.
Those at the meeting said there is a need tor
dialogue between students, janitors and admin
istrators. In light of'the Justice for Janitors rally
held last week, students also want the ASSU to
look at the wages of workers.
The meeting also addressed financial and
economic concerns. Students want the ASSU to
simplify the Special Fee process and generate
money flow charts to demonstrate how the
ASSU is using their money.
While the Town Hall meeting was held to es
tablish some direction for next year's ASSU, the
open forums will continue. Next school year,
the meetings "could be happening at least one
time per quarter," Chang said.
