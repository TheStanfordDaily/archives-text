seems like every student at Stan
lord has more than one serious
lield of study.
I he Faculty Senate discussed
double majors at its May I 1 meet
ing, debating whether too many stu
dents major in two disciplines.
Economics Prof. John Shoven
expressed concern that approxi
mately 25 percent of Stanford stu
dents double major, lie said that
students who study two fields are
not fully invested in either one.
He also mentioned that stu
dents who double major are less
likely to participate in honors pro
grams and write honors theses.
Assistant Vice Provost Fori White
said that students had a variety of
reasons for double majoring. She

supports students who double
major fora "good intellectual rea
son" or because they have intellectu
al interests in diverse areas.
White objected to students who
see the double major as nothing
more than an advantage in the job
market. She said this perceived ad
vantage often "does not play out."
According to White, these stu
dents might be better served by a
minor, which was introduced to
give students advanced training in
multiple disciplines without the re
quirements of another major.
She also encouraged students to
talk to advisors, faculty and the Ca
reer Development Center about
the best preparation fora certain
job or graduate training in a cer
tain field. With these conversa
tions, they could make "better in
formed decisions."
"Students should be making
their decisions ... based on intel
lectual reasons," instead of simply

"collecting degrees," she said.
Spanish and Portuguese Prof.
Mary Pratt supports the large
number of double majors. Accord
ing to her, majoring in two areas
reflects students' ambition and
broad range of interests.
Pratt said that Stanford places
a priority on admitting students
with broad interests, and that the
high percentage of double majors
is a positive reflection of Stanford
students and their breadth.
According to Pratt, many who
double major pursue one major in a
science-related field and another in
a humanities-related field. These
students desire advanced training
in a wide variety of subjects.
I he debate stemmed from a
Faculty Senate report proposing
that all majors be reviewed period
ically. This report, written by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, did not specifically ad
dress the issue of double majors

but did spark the debate.
During the discourse, Presi
dent Casper said that he sensed
Stanford's peer universities were
also discussing this topic. These
other schools were questioning to
what extent the major should be
the centerpiece of intellectual
training.
The debate did not address
the distinction between dual and
secondary majors. Fora dual
major, courses can only fulfill a
requirement in one field. A stu
dent who pursues a dual major
receives one degree from each
department.
Students who receive secondary
majors often obtain them in relat
ed fields, such as economics and
public policy.
Fora secondary major, which
does not award another degree,
courses may be counted toward
meeting the requirements of both
departments.
