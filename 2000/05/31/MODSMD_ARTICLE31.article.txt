## A
						WEEKLY LOOK AT ARTS, ENTERTAINMENT AND STYLE AT STANFORD Tackling the Bard's most obscure Love's Labour's Lost 
### LAUREN RUSSELL EDITORIAL STAFF 
Kenneth Branagh is d uly a Rennaisance man. Not only do his pas
sions lie in Shakespeare's Rennaisance-era plays, but his varied talents
seem tc> multiply with every film he puts out. Already a highly respected
force in 112 lollywood as an actor and director, Branagh has most recently
I l ied his hand at singing and dancing in the soon-to-be released musical
comedy Loves Labours Lost," which he directs and stars in. He was re
cently in San lranc isco to talk about his new film with Intermission.
Branagh drifted in looking very confused after wandering lost about
the Ritz Carlton in San I rancisco. He had just returned from Cannes,
where he had a "rather embarrasing and strange" experience, having
been stripped hall-naked on a piano while being massaged by Victoria's
Secret model 1 leidi Klum (I'd imagine there are lew sympathetic ears to
his lament). ()ne minute into the interview, Kevin Klein walked in fora
surprise visit, knocked down a table of glasses in his excitement at seeing
Branagh and giving him a giant bear hug. The two recently recorded the
voices for the animated film" I he Road to LI Dorado" and are good
friends.
Klein leli us alone to do the interview, and Branagh began to reveal
the method to the magic that he brings to Shakespeare's already genius
work. Branagh's 1992 adaptation of" Much Ado About Nothing" made
Shakespeare accessible to a wider audience without losing the heart of the
original texts, and sparked a slew of adaptations of all shapes and sizes.
I lis most recent Shakespeare film, a four-hour version of"Hamlet" with
Gerard Depart lien and Robin Williams, is still acclaimed as one of its best
adaptations. And now he's bringing Shakespeare to the screen again with
the incredibly original "Love's labour's Lost," a mix between a cheesy
war movie and a romantic musical comedv.

Set to be released in early June, critics have already heaped praise on the brilliant
film, which is set in France (luring WWII and is full of musical numbers where stars
like Alicia Silver'stone try their hand at singing and dancing to standards from the '30s
and '40s. I he film, which is co-produced by Martin Scorsese, is absolutely delightful.
Although Shakespeare's work often suffers when it is adapted into modern settings,
Branagh verges on improving the original version bv adding delightful song and
dance numbers to the play to make it seem as ii it were written for the war era.
When Branagh screened the film, "It was unquestionably something that every
one was surprised by. People were looking around looking confused and I would yell
'well, I told you it was a fâ€”king musical!"'
l he actor/director has had a romance with musicals since childhood. "I had
watched a lot of musicals growing up. They were a staple. I loved that escapist, glam
orous world of vivid 1 echnicolor. People were always doing silly things but they were
charming, boy meets girl, you know."
This IiI i n shares that. "Love's labour's" takes on some of the greatest qualities of
an old romantic musical while keeping the storytelling horsepower of the Bard, and
the two blend together surprisingly well. "It is very simple and veiy silly. I lie songs
all lit the play perfectly even though they were not made for the play, like where
Berowne gets to that part where he talks about the transforming and transcendent
power of love and then it goes straight into "heaven, I'm in heaven" in "Dancing
(llieek to Cheek." 1 like that innocence that these musicals have, the lack of cynicism."
()ne of Shakespeare's most obscure comedies, "Love's Labour's" does not have the
audience recognition that better-known plays do, but Branagh had a feeling that he
could do something quite different with this. "It is a rather obscure play, and I am al
wavs amused by friends who say 'oh, I haven't read the play in a while. 1 just laugh
and say 'yeah, you never read it in the first place.' I think that people sometimes as
sume that 1 am eventually going to [adapt] all of Shakespeare's plays, but I don't have
all that time, so I just work with the ones that I have a strong feeling about. 1 have
never seen 'Love's Labour's Lost' in the theater, but 1 read it and really felt like I could
do something great with it."
Despite the brilliant outcome, the film was difficult to produce, mostly because of
the obscurity of the play. But when there's a Will (Shakespeare, that is), there's a way.
"This film isn't like I lamlet, because audiences are not going to expect a man with a
skull and the "To Be or Not to Be" speech. We try to find ways of challenging the way
we bring the story to the audience. Many people couldn't give a monkey's arse and
find Shakespeare a bit stodgy, but I at least would like to get something good out there
and give people the choice; say to tlieni 'well, make up your own mind. We will try
and divest it of some of the things that put you off, which is a sense of self-importance
which comes with these kind of things.' It is a difficult balance, because you don't want
to patronize people or be so stunt-led or gimmick-led that you are defeating the cen
tral purpose of keeping the language alive. We don't change the language at all but
we try to make it very human, very real and understandable. People are afraid of
Shakespeare because of the language."
Not only did Branagh worry about audiences understanding the play, but the ac
tors had a hard time with the language as well. "There is some mysterious thing that

goes
on in act-

ing Shake-

speare that the
language actually

plays on the actors once
they get used to the lan-

guage. It takes over. That
breaks down the nervousness

that the actors share with the au
dience about the language. Actors

are always saving 1 want to make
sure I get this. I don't want to be miss-

ing anything.' Kventually it becomes
second nature, like learning the piano,

because eventually it comes out naturally.
Practicing a lot is actually a good thing to do.
I only cast people who were willing to do the

work involved in learning the language."
Adapting the play wasn't eas\ despite the
willingness of the cast, especially with the con
straints of using actors who needed training in

song and dance and t he adaptation of something
hundreds of years old into another era during
which most Americans were not alive vet.
Branagh put an enormous amount of effort into
making a musical virtually from scratch.

"Our hearts were on our sleeves. We really
tried to be absolutely perfect. It took quite some
time to sec it this all would come together, and we
had to explain some things that would be obscure
to the audience, since this play is not well known.
That's why we used this newsreel device," Branagh

said, referring to the black-and white news clips he inter
sperses throughout the film to explain the action. "The first five minutes ol this film
are done very slowly and are explained in modern English, so that people can be
come attuned to the language. In "Much Ado" we did a similar thing, where a per
son was speaking the lines and they were coming up in subtitles on the screen, so
you are reading it, and hearing it, and it's all fine, right. Nobody died, we are all
()k," he laughed.

When asked how he chose the specific actors, Branagh gave them the credit,
tather than himself or the producers. "The actors sort of came to me. It is an illusion
