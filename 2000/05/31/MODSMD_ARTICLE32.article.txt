# Chan's high 'Noon' packed with low comedy
## 
### OWEN ELLICKSON 
When you go to see a Jackie Chan movie,
vou're not expec ting a scathing portrait of
greed or a 112 resh take on the abortion issue.
You're looking for some dives oft buildings
and (lhan doing weird, violent stuff With his
feet. So there's only one relevant question
about "Shanghai Noon," Chan's newest
movie: Does it deliver the goods?
1 lie answer: Kventually.
Chan plays Chon Wang, a Chinese im
perial guardsman sent to rescue a kid
napped princess in the Old West. Along the
way, lie encounters and eventually be
friends Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson), a
sensitive bandit. It's the formula that made
"Rush Hour" one of the biggest hits of
1999: |ackie-and-a-wacky-American-guy
teani-up-to-save-a-pained-looking-Chi-
nese-girl-and-Jackie-kicks-everything-a-
lot.
(lhan, as always, holds up his end of the
movie. He combines incredible stuntwork
with deft comic acting and one of the most
winning smiles you'll ever see. C lhan makes
the best of some pretty lame lines. Plus, he

beats people up with moose
antlers, a horseshoe and his
own pony tail. Can't fault him
for trying.
Wilson also entertains,
with a performance as
charming as his first name.
His thoughtful 1990s de
meanor provides the movie's
freshest moments â€” he criti
cizes Wang's "male-domi
nated society" and chatters
about variables and vectors.
Like Chan, Wilson makes
dumb dialogue sound bet
ter, and like Chan, becomes
off as a nice, likeable guy.
Unfortunately, "Shang
hai Noon" takes too long to
let its stars shine. The mur
der of Wang's uncle is an un
necessarily dark moment
that clouds the first half of

the movie. Chan spends 40 minutes look
ing sad and worried; that's a waste of a per
former with his charisma. And O'Bannon
and Wang's frequent clashes don't ring
true, since they're clearly both just big soft

ies. The movie doesn't really come together
until they join forces.
Also, the dialogue is weak, and most of
the intended gags fall flat. Wilson and (lhan
deserve better than puns and brainless

jokes about peeing. I lie two
stars are clearlv capable <>l .1
lot, Inn iliev can't salvage
every dumb one-liner.
I here's something wrong
when the outtakes are more
clever than the ac tual mo\ ie.
Still, it's sillv to quibble
about the dial<>gue in .1 mat -
tial-arts Western. And one e
( lian and Wilson decide to
team up to save the prim ess.
things do pick up. A
harfight, a duel and a crazed
Chinese drinking game
make lor some good old
fashioned entertainment.
And the climactic battle in .1
church raises interesting
questions about the role of
organized religion in an 111-
creasingly masculinized and
financially consumed soci-

ety. Or not.
The fight scenes are well-choreo
graphed and creative, as expected. 1 lowev
er, it seems like there's one light 100 lew
and (lhan never reallv busts out the insane

inspired stimls that marked much of his
I long Kong work. Whethei due to old age
or increasing life insurance rates, Chan
seems to he working at half-speed in
"Shanghai Noon. ()f com se, "halt-speed"
for him means knocking out 1 guvs and
killing from .1 twenty-foot ceiling to the
I 100 1. so the mo\ ie's not e\,i( tlx boring as it
stands.
II you're a ( 'ban fan, you'll probably like
this one fine. II you're not. you should he,
and this is an adequate introduction.
"Shanghai \oon" will make you realK like
|ackie C.lian and Owen Wilson. \i times,
though, it'll make vou wish the\ were 111 .1
better nun ie.
