# Harvard head to depart post
## As Rudenstine, Casper leave presidencies, campuses reflect on leaders' tenures 
### PATRICK C. CROSETTO EVAN NORDBY CONTRIBUTING WRITERS 
Within a year of each other nearly a
decade ago, two of the nation's top univer
sities announced the appointment of new

NEWS ANALYSIS

presidents.
Now, in a period of less than nine
months, Harvard's Neil Rudenstine and
Stanford's Gerhard Casper have an
nounced they will be leaving their respec
tive offices.
The two are markedly similar, in biog
raphy and in accomplishments. Both are
scholars in the humanities; Rudenstine is
an expert on poetry, Casper a constitu
tional scholar. Both were appointed presi
dent after successful stints as provost at
rival institutions: Rudenstine at Princeton,
Casper at the University of Chicago. Most
importantly from their institutions' per
spectives, the two proved to be impressive
fundraisers. And each has been strongly
criticized for his refusal to support labor
activism on campus.
But significantly, Casper championed
undergraduate education in a way that
Rudenstine did not. And Casper has
maintained a level of visibility on campus
that one could argue has weakened oppo
sition to his most controversial stances, es
pecially among undergraduates.
Money men
Rudenstine became president of Har
vard at a time when the school was still
well-regarded academically, but some
areas of the university were facing finan
cial bard-times.
Rudenstine headed Harvard's Capital
Campaign, which raked in $2.0 billion
over six years — half a billion more than its
original goal. Over his tenure, the Har
vard endowment has grown from $4.7 bil
lion to $15 billion, making Harvard the
world's second-largest non-profit behind
the Roman Catholic Church.
While not taking the helm of a large
scale campaign, Casper has explicitly

championed Stanford fundraising like
few, if any, presidents before him.
Casper took over in the face of the fi
nancial insecurity caused by Stanford's in
direct-cost scandal, in which Congression
al investigators leaked to the press that
Stanford conceivably could have over
billed the federal government by upwards
of $200 million in research funds.
As it turned out, Stanford only owed
slightly over $1 million, but it took more
than $37 million in lawyers' and accoun
tants' lees to figure that out, and establish
accounting procedures to prevent the
overbilling from happening again.
In the wake of the indirect-cost scandal,
it fell to the newly appointed Casper to
strengthen the University's credibility
with alumni and the public, with future
fundraising a not-insignificant element to
this calculus.
According to Board of Trustees Chair
man Robert Bass, Casper has succeeded.
"Stanford has been transformed under
this leader," Bass told reporters in Sep
tember. "We are better off physically. We
are better off financially. We are better off
administratively. We are better off spiritu
ally."
Bass's stance is supported by the num
bers. Alumni participation in annual giv
ing has grown from 25.7 percent in 1992
to 34.8 percent in 1999, and in the last five
years the University has raised more than
$300 million annually.
The fundraising drives at 1 larvard and
Stanford have paralled construction
booms on both campuses.
Rudenstine oversaw the re-opening of
Memorial Hall as a cafeteria, as originally
intended, as well as the construction of
new arts facilities, the refurbishment of all
freshman dormitories, and the ongoing
renovation of Widener Library.
Casper's tenure has seen the construc
tion of the new Science and Engineering
Quad, the reconstruction of the Bing
Wing of Green Library and the Cantor
Center for the Visual Arts, the earthquake
retrofitting of much of the Quad, and the
residence Capital Improvement Project.
Both faced hard times
Neither man has been immune to criti
cism.
Like many university presidents, both
have faced complaints that they have not
hired enough female or minority faculty
members. Stanford remains under inves
tigation by the Department of Labor for al

leged systemic gender discrimination.
Rudenstine has been criticized for not
improving relations with the town of C lain
bridge, especially due to his refusal to
enact a living wage pledge for Harvard
workers that the town council unanimous
ly supports.
Additionally, many students and alum
ni were upset with the recent absorption
into Harvard University of subsidiary
RadclifFe College, all-male Harvard Col
lege's traditional female counterpart.
Though RadclifFe was in many way s sepa
rate in name only, the move offended fe
male students and alumni already con
cerned with gender equity at the universi
ty.
Casper's tenure hit perhaps its lowest
point only in recent months, with the dis
solution of the merger between UCISF and
Stanford Medical Center-
University sources fault Congress for de
creasing the reimbursement rate for
Medicare, but the merger was conceived
partially to save money in the face oft hat loss
of financing. The fact remains that the
merged UCSF-Stanfbrd Health Care lost
more than $70 million in less than two years.
Casper himself said that "nothing has
been more difficult, more disturbing or
more disappointing" during his eight
years as president than the UCSF-Stan
ford debacle, in bis last State of the Uni
versity address in January.
Stanford under Casper also lias faced
opposition from some local residents and
governments, particularly the City of
Menlo Park, on land use issues.
The University had to win a public vote
against strong opposition to get approval
for the Sand I fill Road project, and is fac
ing zealous opposition to its proposed
General Use Permit and Community Plan
for land use over the next 10 years.
Openness with undergraduates
Perhaps the major difference between
the two Presidents is their relationship
with undergraduates.
Rudenstine is barely ever seen by any of
the undergraduates at Harvard, except
during Opening Exercises and Gradua
tion.
"1 never really interacted with him at
all," M. Rachael Lovett told The Harvard
Crimson. Referring to the upcoming
change in the president's office, she said,
"1 don't think this will affect me that
much."
In an editorial last week, The Harvard

Crimson s.iid that ii hoped unlike Rudens
tine, his successor would "broaden I he scope
of the office beyond that of funtlraising and
managing administrative affairs. In genet al,
we hope that a new president can . .. take
an interest in the academic curriculum of
I larvard's undergraduates."
In contrast, President (iasper has played
a unique and important role in shaping the
lives of Stanford's undergraduates.
"President Casper has made student
contact a high priority." sa\s Vice Provost
for Student Affairs James Montova. " What
other I niversiu president do vou know
who reads bedtime stories to students 01
has regular office hours (br students or ap
pears in Caieties or teat lies undergradu
ates or has been known to make c ampaign
stops for tree candidates?"

In addition to occasionally teaching un

eties, or just walking around campus.
"I love the fad that he walks around the
Quad during the dav and savs hello to

Roach. "I le's the nicest old man ever."
Openness with undergraduates has
characterized Stanford administrations
back to the Vietnam era, when I niversit\
President Kenneth Pitzerand Provost and
latet President Ric hard Lyman took pains
to at least listen to students' concerns.
Lenin Siegel, .1 leader of Stanford's
Students fora Democratic Society ehaptet
during the late (>os, credited L\ man's
openness with making radicals' anti-mili
taiv-reseatch organizing harder in the
earlier years of the movement.

Harvard President Neil Rudenstine announced last week that he is stepping down from his
post, close on the heels of Stanford President Gerhard Casper, who will leave next month.
Though few would allege that
openness by Casper and other
administrators is a calculated
move, the "apathy" toward con
troversial Stanford decisions by
the majority of undergraduates
might at least partially be attrib
uted to students' regular, friend

ly contact with University lead
ers.
But with their combined suc
cesses and missteps, one final
parallel lies the outgoing leaders
of America's top universities to

to assess whether the terms of

to 34.8 percent in 1999, and in the last five
years the University has raised more than
$300 million annually.
The fundraising drives at 1 larvard and
Stanford have paralled construction
booms on both campuses.
Rudenstine oversaw the re-opening of

Wing of Green Library and the Cantor
Center for the Visual Arts, the earthquake
retrofitting of much of the Quad, and the

Both faced hard times
Neither man has been immune to criti
cism.
Like many university presidents, both
have faced complaints that they have not
hired enough female or minority faculty
members. Stanford remains under inves
tigation by the Department of Labor for al

leged systemic gender discrimination.
Rudenstine has been criticized for not
improving relations with the town of C lain
bridge, especially due to his refusal to
enact a living wage pledge for Harvard
workers that the town council unanimous
ly supports.
Additionally, many students and alum
ni were upset with the recent absorption
into Harvard University of subsidiary
RadclifFe College, all-male Harvard Col
lege's traditional female counterpart.
Though RadclifFe was in many way s sepa
rate in name only, the move offended fe
male students and alumni already con
cerned with gender equity at the universi

Casper's tenure hit perhaps its lowest
point only in recent months, with the dis
solution of the merger between UCISF and
Stanford Medical Center-
University sources fault Congress for de
creasing the reimbursement rate for
Medicare, but the merger was conceived
partially to save money in the face oft hat loss
of financing. The fact remains that the
merged UCSF-Stanfbrd Health Care lost
more than $70 million in less than two years.
Casper himself said that "nothing has
been more difficult, more disturbing or
more disappointing" during his eight
years as president than the UCSF-Stan
ford debacle, in bis last State of the Uni
versity address in January.
Stanford under Casper also lias faced
opposition from some local residents and
governments, particularly the City of
Menlo Park, on land use issues.
The University had to win a public vote
against strong opposition to get approval
for the Sand I fill Road project, and is fac
ing zealous opposition to its proposed
General Use Permit and Community Plan
for land use over the next 10 years.
Openness with undergraduates
Perhaps the major difference between
the two Presidents is their relationship
with undergraduates.
Rudenstine is barely ever seen by any of
the undergraduates at Harvard, except
during Opening Exercises and Gradua
tion.
"1 never really interacted with him at
all," M. Rachael Lovett told The Harvard
Crimson. Referring to the upcoming
change in the president's office, she said,
"1 don't think this will affect me that
much."
In an editorial last week, The Harvard

Crimson s.iid that ii hoped unlike Rudens
tine, his successor would "broaden I he scope
of the office beyond that of funtlraising and
managing administrative affairs. In genet al,
we hope that a new president can . .. take
an interest in the academic curriculum of
I larvard's undergraduates."
In contrast, President (iasper has played
a unique and important role in shaping the
lives of Stanford's undergraduates.

for Student Affairs James Montova. " What

Harvard President Neil Rudenstine announced last week that he is stepping down from his
post, close on the heels of Stanford President Gerhard Casper, who will leave next month.
Though few would allege that
openness by Casper and other
administrators is a calculated
move, the "apathy" toward con
troversial Stanford decisions by
the majority of undergraduates
might at least partially be attrib
uted to students' regular, friend

ly contact with University lead
ers.
But with their combined suc
cesses and missteps, one final
parallel lies the outgoing leaders
of America's top universities to
gether: only history will he able
to assess whether the terms of
Rudenstine at Harvard and
Casper at Stanford will be re
membered as steps forward or
steps to keep up.
Within a year of each other nearly a
decade ago, two of the nation's top univer
sities announced the appointment of new

NEWS ANALYSIS

presidents.
Now, in a period of less than nine
months, Harvard's Neil Rudenstine and
Stanford's Gerhard Casper have an
nounced they will be leaving their respec
tive offices.
The two are markedly similar, in biog
raphy and in accomplishments. Both are
scholars in the humanities; Rudenstine is
an expert on poetry, Casper a constitu
tional scholar. Both were appointed presi
dent after successful stints as provost at
rival institutions: Rudenstine at Princeton,
Casper at the University of Chicago. Most
importantly from their institutions' per
spectives, the two proved to be impressive
fundraisers. And each has been strongly
criticized for his refusal to support labor
activism on campus.
But significantly, Casper championed
undergraduate education in a way that
Rudenstine did not. And Casper has
maintained a level of visibility on campus
that one could argue has weakened oppo
sition to his most controversial stances, es
pecially among undergraduates.
Money men
Rudenstine became president of Har
vard at a time when the school was still
well-regarded academically, but some
areas of the university were facing finan
cial bard-times.
Rudenstine headed Harvard's Capital
Campaign, which raked in $2.0 billion
over six years — half a billion more than its
original goal. Over his tenure, the Har
vard endowment has grown from $4.7 bil
lion to $15 billion, making Harvard the
world's second-largest non-profit behind
the Roman Catholic Church.
While not taking the helm of a large
scale campaign, Casper has explicitly

championed Stanford fundraising like
few, if any, presidents before him.
Casper took over in the face of the fi
nancial insecurity caused by Stanford's in
direct-cost scandal, in which Congression
al investigators leaked to the press that
Stanford conceivably could have over
billed the federal government by upwards
of $200 million in research funds.
As it turned out, Stanford only owed
slightly over $1 million, but it took more
than $37 million in lawyers' and accoun
tants' lees to figure that out, and establish
accounting procedures to prevent the
overbilling from happening again.
In the wake of the indirect-cost scandal,
it fell to the newly appointed Casper to
strengthen the University's credibility
with alumni and the public, with future
fundraising a not-insignificant element to
this calculus.
According to Board of Trustees Chair
man Robert Bass, Casper has succeeded.
"Stanford has been transformed under
this leader," Bass told reporters in Sep
tember. "We are better off physically. We
are better off financially. We are better off
administratively. We are better off spiritu
ally."
Bass's stance is supported by the num
bers. Alumni participation in annual giv
ing has grown from 25.7 percent in 1992
to 34.8 percent in 1999, and in the last five
years the University has raised more than
$300 million annually.
