### MATT McQUINN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ihe Stanford women's golf
team went out for Chinese food
after the second day of competi
tion at tlie NCAA Champi
onships in Sun River, Ore. On
the way out of the restaurant,
head coach Caroline O'Connor
cracked open her fortune cook
ie. From it she pulled a minute
piece of paper — little did she
know it would foretell the fu
ture.
The paper read, "All your
hard work will soon pay of 112."
Not knowing that this little
paper bore so much truth, the
team entered Saturday, the final
day of competition, alone in
sixth.
On this fated day, braving
conditions that boasted gales of
up to 45 mph, the No. 5 Stan
ford women's golf team fired the
lowest score for I he day of all the
teams — catapulting it up in the
standings to finish in second.
The tea in concluded 21
strokes behind No. I Arizona,
which led the tournament for
the final three davs of competi
tion.
Leading the team was junior
star Stephanie Keever. Keever
fired a phenomenal 72 on the
final day, which included a spec
tacular hole-in-one on the par 3
thirteenth.
"I hit the ball a little left of the
pin, and it hopped right in,"
Keever said.
Keever's 72 tied the individ
ual low score for the day, on a
day where the two low individu
als for the tournament, Ari
zona's Jenna Daniels and Julia
Kraschinski, shot a 77 and an SO,
respectively. Keever finished
tied for fifth, eight strokes be
hind the victor, Daniels.
Junior teammate Hilary
Homeyer, carding a final-day
74, finished three behind Keev
er for the competition, in a tie
for thirteenth.
In addition, freshman Kim
Rowton's finaday 73 also vault
ed her up in the individual
standings. Rowton concluded
one stroke behind Homeyer
