# Golfers finish second
## 
### MATT McQUINN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ihe Stanford women's golf
team went out for Chinese food
after the second day of competi
tion at tlie NCAA Champi
onships in Sun River, Ore. On
the way out of the restaurant,
head coach Caroline O'Connor
cracked open her fortune cook
ie. From it she pulled a minute
piece of paper — little did she
know it would foretell the fu
ture.
The paper read, "All your
hard work will soon pay of 112."
Not knowing that this little
paper bore so much truth, the
team entered Saturday, the final
day of competition, alone in
sixth.
On this fated day, braving
conditions that boasted gales of
up to 45 mph, the No. 5 Stan
ford women's golf team fired the
lowest score for I he day of all the
teams — catapulting it up in the
standings to finish in second.
The tea in concluded 21
strokes behind No. I Arizona,
which led the tournament for
the final three davs of competi
tion.
Leading the team was junior
star Stephanie Keever. Keever
fired a phenomenal 72 on the
final day, which included a spec
tacular hole-in-one on the par 3
thirteenth.
"I hit the ball a little left of the
pin, and it hopped right in,"
Keever said.
Keever's 72 tied the individ
ual low score for the day, on a
day where the two low individu
als for the tournament, Ari
zona's Jenna Daniels and Julia
Kraschinski, shot a 77 and an SO,
respectively. Keever finished
tied for fifth, eight strokes be
hind the victor, Daniels.
Junior teammate Hilary
Homeyer, carding a final-day
74, finished three behind Keev
er for the competition, in a tie
for thirteenth.
In addition, freshman Kim
Rowton's finaday 73 also vault
ed her up in the individual
standings. Rowton concluded
one stroke behind Homeyer
with a 299.
Rounding out the (Cardinal
lini'-u|) were senior |aejean Ro,
w h<»concluded in a lie lor 11 st,
and junior Salimah Muss,mi,
who finished in 124 th.
With scores that included a
72, a 7.'l and a 74 on the final
dav of competition, the (Cardi
nal made lip valuable ground
between it and its competition.
()n Saturdav, the team was able
to overtake I SC, lexas, Ore
gon and (.corgi,i in the stand
ings. In the end. Texas finished
one stroke behind Stanford and
one ahead ol I SC. with Ceoi
gia and Oregon falling back to
seventh and ,i tie for I I ill amid
the stormy conditions of the
final day.
I his marks the best-ever fin
ish for the (Cardinal in N( AA

Championship competition.
I he Cardinal lias finished
eighth the previous two years
and had never concluded this
competition better than fourth.
"It's awesome," O'Connor
said. "Kven amid the tough con
ditions. we never once doubted
ourselves."
Next year, the Cardinal
plans to be a similar threat.
Stanford stands to lose only one
player — Ro — next season.
Ro played a substantial role
in Stanford's postseason suc c ess
with hei consistently low scores
and excellent finishes, such as
her second-place finish at the
Stanford / San Jose State Desert
Dual.
"|aejean has been invaluable
to our team." ()'(.0111101 said.
"She brought a lot of leadership
into this ( hampionship."
I lie second-place finish
comes off a season that saw the
Stanford players struggle with
their games during some points
of the season. However, every
thing came togethei when it

counted.
At the I'ac-IO Champi
onships, Stanford had to fact-
No. I Arizona, No. ISC and
No. 1 Arizona State. I he onl\
team that the Cardinal was un
able to defeat was the No. I Ari

zona, wiih Stanford finishing
second.
I lie same holds n tic for the
NCAA Championships. While

added to the pool ol loinpetition, the Cardinal
again was able to w resile its wa\ to a near \ it lor\ —
again rinishing behintl \ri/ona.
In retrospect, the ('.artlinal has been able to de
le. it all but one team this season. While in sonic
wa\s this ma\ seem disappoinling, it gives the I cam
members something to work lor in the oil-season.
While kecver and lloineyci are representing
0111 countiA in the British Isles at the Curtis Cup
this summer, lhe\ will also be preparing to dual
('.onferent c
Rival Arizona in the ensuing season. And while
Rowton is liue-tuning her game back in San Anto
nio, she will be imagining making the winning putt
at next war's < hanipionships.
In fat 1. the Cardinal will conic into next yeai
with considerable competitive experience. Next
year the Cardinal will have two ol the top rated
players in the country, kecver and llonieycr, re
turn 111 gas seniors, spoil illg I h ree yea rs ol St alllt>i 11
collegiate competition under their belts.
In addition. Rowton will be returning as a
sophomore. With impressive finishes as a fresh
man. sut has leading the team at the I'ac-10 (iliam
pionship and at Rcgionals, it is scar\ to think ol
what she can accomplish.
Finally, the team will have a golfer returning
from her overseas studies in addition to two phe
nomenal freshmen recruits.
"We persevered through some adverse condi
tions antl came out on top," O'Connor said. "All
our hard work has paid off."
