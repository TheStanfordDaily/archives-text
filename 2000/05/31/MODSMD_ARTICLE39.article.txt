## Cardinal captures Regional with an emotional 16-6 win over tired Alabama 
### BRETT KAUFMAN STAFF WRITER 
Dramatic finishes, failed comebacks, con
troversy, emotional swings — and just one
team — were ;ill that remained after a full
slate of NCAA Regional baseball came to a
close on Sunday evening at Sunken Dia
mond.
Stanford, the region's top seed and fa
vorite, finished oil the Alabama Crimson
Tide 1 (i-C) in the second championship game
Sunday night to capture its second consecu
tive Regional title and to advance to the
NCAA Super Regionals against Nebraska at
Sunken Diamond next weekend.
"It was obviously a long weekend but a
good result," said head coach Mark Mar
quess. "It was a great weekend for Stanford

baseball."
The Cardinal wasted no time in the (lo
ot-die game, scoring seven limes in the first
two innings to remind any doubters whose
Regional this was to win. A solid pitching
performance from sophomore Brian Sager
earned him the victory, as he allowed four
runs in six innings and left with a 1 (»-4 lead.
The offense for Stanford continued
throughout the game, with a three-tun
homer in the seventh from senior Jol m (.all
that started a six-run inning to cap an im
pressive statement at the- plate. Ihe tired
arms of Alabama, which was playing its sec
ond double-header in two days, became ap
parent as the game wore on.
I lie Regional format "is really tough,"
said Crimson Fide head coach Jim Wells.
"Physically, the main thing is that pitching is
worn down, and that's how you gft beat
badly."
After Stanford rolled to a relatively easy
win in its Friday game against Fresno State,
5-1, and Alabama pounded Nevada 8-2,
