## Cardinal captures Regional with an emotional 16-6 win over tired Alabama 
### BRETT KAUFMAN STAFF WRITER 
Dramatic finishes, failed comebacks, con
troversy, emotional swings — and just one
team — were ;ill that remained after a full
slate of NCAA Regional baseball came to a
close on Sunday evening at Sunken Dia
mond.
Stanford, the region's top seed and fa
vorite, finished oil the Alabama Crimson
Tide 1 (i-C) in the second championship game
Sunday night to capture its second consecu
tive Regional title and to advance to the
NCAA Super Regionals against Nebraska at
Sunken Diamond next weekend.
"It was obviously a long weekend but a
good result," said head coach Mark Mar
quess. "It was a great weekend for Stanford

baseball."
The Cardinal wasted no time in the (lo
ot-die game, scoring seven limes in the first
two innings to remind any doubters whose
Regional this was to win. A solid pitching
performance from sophomore Brian Sager
earned him the victory, as he allowed four
runs in six innings and left with a 1 (»-4 lead.
The offense for Stanford continued
throughout the game, with a three-tun
homer in the seventh from senior Jol m (.all
that started a six-run inning to cap an im
pressive statement at the- plate. Ihe tired
arms of Alabama, which was playing its sec
ond double-header in two days, became ap
parent as the game wore on.
I lie Regional format "is really tough,"
said Crimson Fide head coach Jim Wells.
"Physically, the main thing is that pitching is
worn down, and that's how you gft beat
badly."

win in its Friday game against Fresno State,

both teams headed into their
first-ever meeting Saturday with
the Regional's driver's seat on the
line.
A dramatic ninth-inning, live
run rally gave Stanford the win
and control of the Regional, and
the Cardinal needed just one win
on Sunday in two chances to ad
vance to the next round of the
tournament.
Junior Joe Borchard's second
home run of the afternoon — this
time of the three-run variety —
traveled over the right-field wall
and tied the game in dramatic
fashion, bringing the entire
Sunken Diamond crowd to its
feet.
"I was just trying to cover my
neck," said Borchard, who had
struck out twice before with run
ners in scoring position in the
game. "I was the main culprit for
our inability to score earlier in the
game. I wasn't going back into
that dugout with another strike
out."
The Cardinal followed by
manufacturing two more runs

before t lit* inning ended to take a
8-6 lead into the bottom of the
ninth. Junior Justin Wayne came
out and dosed out his start to seal
the victory for Stanford.
The Cardinal — playing as the
visiting team — struck first on
sophomore Chris O'Riordan's
RBI double to center in the
fourth. Then Borchard's sixth
inning blast to left field with one
man on base put Stanford ahead
3-0, with Wayne sailing along on
the mound.
However, trouble found
Wayne in the bottom half of the
sixth as the first three Crimson
Tide batters reached base. After
recording a strikeout and surren
dering a single, Wayne took ju
nior Casey Lambert to a full
count with the bases loaded.
When his next pitch was ruled
a ball by home plate umpire Jack
Cox, Wayne strutted toward the
mound with a head of steam and
was calmed by senior catcher
Daniien Alvarado. As the umpire
continued to hear shouting from
the Cardinal dugout, Cox issued
a warning to the bench and then
promptly ejected Marquess from
the contest.
"It was an awkward moment, a
controversial pitch," Wayne said.
Marquess explained his first

ejection of the season this way:
Cox "was hearing something
from our bench — he wasn't
hearing it from me. 1 said a few
things to him, and lie threw me
out."
Stanford's uncharacteristically
animated skipper was then re
signed to Sunken Diamond's
clubhouse to listen to the remain
der of the game on the radio.
On the pitch following the
ejection and lengthy delay,
sophomore Scott McClanahan
sent Wayne's fastball over the
left-center-field wall fora grand
slam, giving the Crimson Tide a
6-3 lead. The score remained in
the Tide's favor until the ninth
inning comeback — the first Car
dinal win of the season when
trailing after eight innings.
Alabama then took the field
later Saturday night to beat
Nevada 6-5 and to advance to
Sunday competition.
Though the Cardinal climbed
back into Sunday afternoon's first
contest after trailing by eight runs
to the Tide, the rally fell short as
Alabama used four ninth-inning
runs to secure the 14-9 victory
and force the second Champi
onship game. Alabama needed to
beat Stanford twice on Sunday to
advance in the tournament,

while the Cardinal needed to win
just once.
Stanford trailed 10-2 after six
and one-half innings but roared
back with seven straight men
reaching base. The seven-run in
ning left the Cardinal behind by
one and in striking distance to
end the Regional early.
However, the Tide finally
broke through in Cardinal reliev
er Mike Wodnicki's fifth inning of
work to pull away and make the
seventh game of the Stanford Re
gional a winner-take-all affair.
Stanford's rout of the evening
contest was the 1 Ith time all sea
son that the Cardinal bounced
back from a loss to win its next
game.
But it was the dramatic Satur
day comeback in the most emo
tional game of the season that
highlighted the weekend for
Stanford. It left the unshakable
notion in the minds of opponents
that this Cardinal team will not be
satisfied with anything short of a
return trip to Omaha for the ( ol

Now the Cardinal needs to
win a three-game series — some
thing it has done all but two times
all season — starting Friday night
in the Super Regionals to fulfill

NCAA Super Regionals against Nebraska at
Sunken Diamond next weekend.
"It was obviously a long weekend but a
good result," said head coach Mark Mar
quess. "It was a great weekend for Stanford

baseball."
The Cardinal wasted no time in the (lo
ot-die game, scoring seven limes in the first
two innings to remind any doubters whose
Regional this was to win. A solid pitching
performance from sophomore Brian Sager
earned him the victory, as he allowed four
runs in six innings and left with a 1 (»-4 lead.
The offense for Stanford continued
throughout the game, with a three-tun
homer in the seventh from senior Jol m (.all
that started a six-run inning to cap an im
pressive statement at the- plate. Ihe tired
arms of Alabama, which was playing its sec
ond double-header in two days, became ap
parent as the game wore on.
I lie Regional format "is really tough,"
said Crimson Fide head coach Jim Wells.
"Physically, the main thing is that pitching is
worn down, and that's how you gft beat
badly."
After Stanford rolled to a relatively easy
win in its Friday game against Fresno State,
5-1, and Alabama pounded Nevada 8-2,

both teams headed into their
first-ever meeting Saturday with
the Regional's driver's seat on the
line.
A dramatic ninth-inning, live
run rally gave Stanford the win
and control of the Regional, and
the Cardinal needed just one win
on Sunday in two chances to ad
vance to the next round of the
tournament.
Junior Joe Borchard's second
home run of the afternoon — this
time of the three-run variety —
traveled over the right-field wall
and tied the game in dramatic
fashion, bringing the entire
Sunken Diamond crowd to its
feet.
"I was just trying to cover my
neck," said Borchard, who had
struck out twice before with run
ners in scoring position in the
game. "I was the main culprit for
our inability to score earlier in the
game. I wasn't going back into
that dugout with another strike
out."
The Cardinal followed by
manufacturing two more runs

before t lit* inning ended to take a
8-6 lead into the bottom of the
ninth. Junior Justin Wayne came
out and dosed out his start to seal
the victory for Stanford.
The Cardinal — playing as the
visiting team — struck first on
sophomore Chris O'Riordan's
RBI double to center in the
fourth. Then Borchard's sixth
inning blast to left field with one
man on base put Stanford ahead
3-0, with Wayne sailing along on
the mound.
However, trouble found
Wayne in the bottom half of the
sixth as the first three Crimson
Tide batters reached base. After
recording a strikeout and surren
dering a single, Wayne took ju
nior Casey Lambert to a full
count with the bases loaded.
When his next pitch was ruled
a ball by home plate umpire Jack
Cox, Wayne strutted toward the
mound with a head of steam and
was calmed by senior catcher
Daniien Alvarado. As the umpire
continued to hear shouting from
the Cardinal dugout, Cox issued
a warning to the bench and then
promptly ejected Marquess from
the contest.
"It was an awkward moment, a
controversial pitch," Wayne said.
Marquess explained his first

ejection of the season this way:
Cox "was hearing something
from our bench — he wasn't
hearing it from me. 1 said a few
things to him, and lie threw me
out."
Stanford's uncharacteristically
animated skipper was then re
signed to Sunken Diamond's
clubhouse to listen to the remain
der of the game on the radio.
On the pitch following the
ejection and lengthy delay,
sophomore Scott McClanahan
sent Wayne's fastball over the
left-center-field wall fora grand
slam, giving the Crimson Tide a
6-3 lead. The score remained in
the Tide's favor until the ninth
inning comeback — the first Car
dinal win of the season when
trailing after eight innings.
Alabama then took the field
later Saturday night to beat
Nevada 6-5 and to advance to
Sunday competition.
Though the Cardinal climbed
back into Sunday afternoon's first
contest after trailing by eight runs
to the Tide, the rally fell short as
Alabama used four ninth-inning
runs to secure the 14-9 victory
and force the second Champi
onship game. Alabama needed to
beat Stanford twice on Sunday to
advance in the tournament,

while the Cardinal needed to win
just once.
Stanford trailed 10-2 after six
and one-half innings but roared
back with seven straight men
reaching base. The seven-run in
ning left the Cardinal behind by
one and in striking distance to
end the Regional early.
However, the Tide finally
broke through in Cardinal reliev
er Mike Wodnicki's fifth inning of
work to pull away and make the
seventh game of the Stanford Re
gional a winner-take-all affair.
Stanford's rout of the evening
contest was the 1 Ith time all sea
son that the Cardinal bounced
back from a loss to win its next
game.
But it was the dramatic Satur
day comeback in the most emo
tional game of the season that
highlighted the weekend for
Stanford. It left the unshakable
notion in the minds of opponents
that this Cardinal team will not be
satisfied with anything short of a
return trip to Omaha for the ( ol
lege World Series.
Now the Cardinal needs to
win a three-game series — some
thing it has done all but two times
all season — starting Friday night
in the Super Regionals to fulfill
that goal.
