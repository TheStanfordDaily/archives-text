N ice Provost for Student Affairs James
Montoya, i hair of the I laas director search
committee, said (an/ satisfied the wishes of
students, the University and national
groups affiliated with the I laas Center.
"Stanford students desired a director
who understands students and who has
an open door," Montoya wrote in a state
ment to the I laas Unifying Board. " The
National Advisory Board asked that we
find a leader, as well as a good manager.
The Faculty Steering Committee indi
cated its desire fora director who would
strengthen the ties between academic
departments and the Haas Center.
Nadinne Cruz meets our criteria and 1
believe is the right person for the next

phase of the Haas Center's develop
ment."
Search committee members said Cruz's
previous experience as 1 laas C Center inter
im director was not central to the decision
to hire Cruz as permanent director.
"[Her status as interim director] was
not too important," said senior Antonia
Welch, one of two students on the search
committee. "Clearly Nadinne has done
an excellent job as interim director of the
Haas Center. Nonetheless, as a commit
tee, we were looking at long-term perfor
mance, the candidate's status as a nation
al leader and the ability to negotiate the
complicated politics of University-com
munity relations."
Cruz said her central role as new di
rector of the 1 laas (Center will be to move
issues of public service into the curricu
lum of the University.
"It is not enough that the I laas ('.enter
is regarded as a national model for pub
lic service centers in higher education,"
Cruz said. "In relation to the immense,
intractable social issues of our times, what
we need is for Stanford to become even
more extraordinary for its public service
education across the curriculum.

"This kind of education provides insti
tutionalized w ays lor faculty, students and
stall to pursue the highest level of scholar
ship and intellectual inquiry ... It is not an
abandonment of Stanford's primary pur
poses; rather ii is the shaping of the pursuit
of those purposes by a desire for, and vi
sion of, a better world for everyone, espe
cially the most disadvantaged."
I laas Center stall members said they
were excited about Cruz's selection and
were confident in her leadership abili
ties.
"The selection ofNadinne is wonder
ful news," said Jackie Scluniclt-l'osner,
assistant director of student development
at the I laas C lenter. "She has the vision of
how public service can be uniquely inte
grated into Stanlbrcl. She understands
the I niversity, the- community and the
needs of stuclents. I could not be happier
with her selection."
Search committee members echoed
Schmidt-Posner's sentiments.
"The Haas Center is an extremely im
portant and special place to many peo pie,
and it trulv deserves a great leader, said
senior Nikki Love, one of two students on
the search committee.
