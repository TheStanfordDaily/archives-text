## Granville tops teammate 
### BILL HANSON STAFF WRITER 
1 .aura Granville couldn't be stopped — not even
bv the top-ranked plaver in collegiate tennis, team
mate Marissa Irvin.
On Sunday, Granville handed Irvin the most
lop-sided loss of her collegiate career, routing the
sophomore star, (>-(), (>-4, for the NCAA Individual
title.
While the store was surprising, it was under
standable.
Although 1 r\ iii was the more experienced play
er, she struggled with her tennis all week, fighting
through several tense three-set matches en route to
the final.
Granville, meanwhile, played flawless tennis
throughout her NC AA debut .In Wednesday's third
round, the freslunan upset defending champion
and fourth-ranked Zu/ana I.esenrova of the Lni
versit\ of S.m Diego, 0-0, 4-f), 0-3. Later that day,
she topped I SC. star jewel Peterson, 0-1, 0-1. I n the
semifinals, she crushed Georgia's Aarthi Venkate
san. ranked fifth in the nation, 0-0, (i-1.
lrvin's semifinal against LNIA s Katarina
Malec, on the othei hand, was far more contentious.
After dropping the lirst set, Irvin rallied lor a 3-0,6-
1, 0-2 victory.
lrvin's serve, normally a weapon, betrayed her
all week. In one match, Irvin served 19 double
faults.
As a result of her serving problems, Irvin relied
on her flat, powerful ground-strokes to win her
mate lies.
Against the hard-hitting, relentlesslv consistent
Granville, that wasn't enough.
In the final, ( uauville won the first ten games of
the match before a tenacious I rvin i allied, eventual
l\ narrowing the second-set score from 0-4 to 4-5.

"Laura was hitting the ball really well from the
beginning," said Stanford assistant coach Lele
Forood. "And Marissa was a little tentative. Ihe
points were very well-played, but Laura just refused
to lose games. The score was not an indicator of the
fact that all tlie games were hotly contested."
Leading 5-4, Granville broke serve to close out
the victory.
"It looked like it could have gone any way at 5-4,"
Forood said. "But Laura just held on and won it."
After the win, Granville was pleased yet reserved.
"I have played with a lot of positive momentum
the whole week, and it carried over into today's
match," she said. "Winning has not really sunk in
yet, and beating Marissa was bittersweet because we
at e good friends and teammates."
Irvin, who fell to Lesenarova in last year's final,
was disappointed after the loss. Nonetheless, she
seemed genuinely happy for her teammate.
"1 did not play particularly well, and Laura
played great — that is why she won the match,"
I r\ in said. "Laura did not miss a ball for the first set
and a half."
1 he all-Stanford final marked the first time in
tournament history that both finalists hailed from
the same school.
"Having Laura and Marissa advance to the
championship match makes a strong statement
about the quality of the women's tennis program at
Stanford," Brennan said. "Laura has been on a roll,
and she played with tremendous confidence and
composure this afternoon."
For (Iranville, the win caps a tremendous debut
season during which she won two collegiate grand
slams — the IT A National Indoor (Championships
and the NGAA Individuals — and posted an unri
valed 4<S-.'5 singles record.
