## 
### TIM KANE STAFF WRITER 
Nobod\ roots for injuries, but
Stanford can't help but be grateful
fora line drive off the bat of Butler
catcher Kddie Ols/ta last weekend.
At the Minneapolis regional last
Friday, Ols/.ta's line drive hap
pened to li nd the chin of Nebraska
pitcher Shane Komine, leaving
Routine's jaw in three pieces, and
depriving Nebraska of their most
potent weapon for the upcoming
Super Regional between Stanford
(45-14) and Nebraska (50-12), to
be held this weekend at Sunken
Diamond.
Komine was the staff ace for the
fluskers throughout the year,
compiling an I 1-3 record and a
phenomenal 2.14 earned run av

erage. Within the past few weeks,
lie was named first-team All-Amer
ica by USA Today/Baseball Week
ly and Collegiate Baseball, in addi
tion toearning Big 12 Player of the
Year honors.
"Of course the team is disap
pointed," said Nebraska head
coach Dave Van Horn at the time,
"bm thev are resilient. They will
have to step it up and get it done."
Ihe Huskers, No. 1 seed in
tlicit regional, wasted little time
proving their coach right, knock
ing out regional host Minnesota
before polishing off Wichita State
Monday to advance to the next
round.
Nebraska finished second be
hind Baylor in the Big 12, but won
live straight games to claim the
conference tournament.
()n the flip side, fresh oil its dis
missal of Alabama in last week
end's Regional round at Sunken
Diamond, the Cardinal knows it
lias tin' pitching equivalent of
inonev in the hank in juniors Jason
Young and Justin Wayne.
Willi the exception of one in
ning for Wayne, both pitchers
looked impressive in going the dis
tance lor complete game victories,
allowing head coach Mark Mar
quess to pi eserve his deep bullpen
lor emergencies.
I his is probahlv our best pitch
ing depth we have had in 10 to 15
years as far as qualitv arms," said
Marquess. "We have Jason and
Justin who are still the workhorses
but we have good arms. We have
been a little inconsistent but we
have much belter depth than we
have had in a number of years."
Marquess, in Ins 24th season as
the head coach on the l arm, has
been around long enough to know
that having great pitching is only

one side of the postseason equa
tion, especially should one of his
pitchers have an off day.
"Sometimes you have to win by
slugging the ball," said Marquess.
"We are capable of doing that. If
you are going to be a good team
you have to have the ability to do
that and also have the ability to win
a 2-1 game. Then you have a good
team."
Nebraska will counter Stan
ford's quality pitching with some
hot arms of its own. Kven with the
loss of Routine lefties Jamie Ro
drigue and Trevor Bullock will be
formidable opponents for Stan
lord to battle. Nebraska's staff as a
whole finished second nationally
with a 3.21 ERA, while its tonfer
eiue mark of 3.31 was tops in the
Big 12.
On the offensive side, junior
Dan Johnson and freshman Matt
Hopper provide plenty of punch
to back up the solid pitching. First
baseman Johnson led the Big 12
with 20 homers on the year, and
carries a whopping .390 average
and .908 slugging percentage into
Sunken Diamond. Hopper, the
designated bitter, adds 21 gopher
balls of his own to go with a .364 av
erage and a team-leading 70 RBI.
