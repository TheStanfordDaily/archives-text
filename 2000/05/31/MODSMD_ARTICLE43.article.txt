Spend ail hour with |ov and
Jason (iofl and you'll swear that
they're so nice ihe\ make Mark
Madsen look like die playground
bully.
Uui somewhere in your mind,
you know they must lie crazy.
Because behind all the smiles
and the hometown warmth, von
have to wonder what makes them
tick. I he\ boast three major side
lining injuries between them.
They push their bodies year
round in preparation lot grueling
two-day tests ol physical and men
tal strength. Iliev have seen
promising seasons end earl\ and
glimpses ol national success re
placed l>\ the uncertainty of heal
ing in lime to begin the next year's
training.
Yet, the mental and physical
wear and tear ol the heptathlon
and decathlon have provided not
just c hallenges, but also opportu
nities, lot the I in net, ()re., sib
lings. I he \ciA things that make
the C'.oils tic k — tlicit lamilv, their
faith, theii belief in community —
ma\ ac tuallv be a breath ol sanitv
in the sometimes Vegas-style
world ol collegiate athletic s.
Joy, a redshirt junior, and
)ason, a freshman, grew 111 > in a
small rural town, the eldest ol lour
children in a lainilx that lias be
come- a household name in Ore
gon track and field. In high
school, |o\ won state titles in the
)()-meter hurdles while also c om
peting 100 meters, 400 meters
and javelin. Jason, two years
younger, was a seven-time state
champion and All-American in

track and field at ('.ascade High
School.
Despite their successes, both
were focusing beyond their high
sc liool careers and knew that they
may have to make some changes
in order to compete .it the colle
giate level.
"We were prettv tall, gangly
kids that were just not going to be
sprinting lor the rest ol Our lives."'
Joy recalls. "I was good at a lot of
different events, so I thought I
might t rv heptathlon. I just hap
pened to do well and kept going."
She became an All-American in
heptathlon her junior and senior
seasons at C.ascade and became a
two-time member ol the United
States Heptathlon / Decathlon |u
nior Peam.
l or Jason, w ho saw bis future in
sprint events seeming limited,
picking up javelin and hurdling
opened the doors to competition
in dec athlon, in w hic h he excelled.
Jason won the 1 99«S | unior
Olympic Nationals, breaking
7.000 points, and the 1998
I SAM' |unior Nationals in de
cathlon.
I heir quick success, however,
doesn't tell the w bole story.
While very few high school
athletes have the opportunitv to
train for and compete in multi
events, the (.oils competed at a
small rural public high school,
w here money for travel, c < >ac liing
staff and equipment were limited
bv budget constraints and few
atliletcs before them had compet
ed at the national level. Instead,
tliev had to rely on the resources
that were available to them: the
support ol their familv and com
munity.

"II ii hadn't been for our fami
ly, we could never have gotten
through," Joy said. " I hey took us
to so main meets, they paid for us
to go across the countn [to coin
pete], for camps in the summer.
I hey were really great —our fam
ily Nat ations would be to the vari
ous i rack places we were going to.
I hey always made it really fun."
When it came time to choose a
college, Jov was swamped with re
cruiting offers. Though slit' con
sidered going as far away as New
York, tilt* lure of staying on the
West Coast, where her family
would be able to watch her com
pete, yet fin enough to expand her
hori/ons, helped to draw her to
Stanford.
"1 didn't want to be a big fish in
a little pond anymore." Joy said. "1
wanted to get out to where there
were challenges that I possibh
couldn't even meet. I just wanted
to spread inv wings and get iu\
own things going."
