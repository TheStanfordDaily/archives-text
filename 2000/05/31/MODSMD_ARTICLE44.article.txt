As lilt- season winds down, Stanford men's crew
gears up tor a grand performance at tlit- Intercolle

June 1-3. Held annually on the Cooper River in
Camden County, N.J., this regatta hosts more than
1,100 oarsmen from over f>o colleges and universi
ties.
I he IRA Regatta is the oldest collegiate rowing
championship in the country. It is a three-day sched
ule of trials and repec hages leading up to 12 champi
onship races involving more than 100 pair-oared,
four-oared and eight-oared crews for men and
women in heavyweight and lightweight competition.
St an lord is one of 21 universities competing in the
2000-meter men's varsitv eight. Other participating
schools include: No. 1 ranked California, Brown,
Purdue, Princeton, Temple and Oregon State. The
Cardinal will lace main of the same schools at Na
tionals that ii competed against during the season,
and thus have an advantage in antic ipating the other
teams' strategies.
l.ast year, Stanford placed second in the
repechage alter Temple with a time of 5 minutes, 47
seconds. In the semi-finals. Stanford placed fifth after
California, Iniversitx of Pennsylvania, Brown and
Temple. Stanford advanceel to the petit final to place
fourth after Temple, Oregon State and Syracuse.
Stanford's liual time was 5:44.50. California placed
first in the grand final with a new course record of
5:23.60.
In St an lord's dual race at Redwood Shores against
Temple two weeks ago, both varsity eights qualified
to advance to the National Championships. Al
though the Stanford men finished after Temple
(5:40.7), they achieved their fastest time of the season
at 5:48.2.
Stanford is a relatively young team this season, as
onlv fifty percent of the men's xarsitx team returned
from last year. As a result, the start <>l this season \v;is
difficult as the team continualK tested itst lf In i hang
ing seat order in the hopes of achieving faster limes.
Although each individual team member had im
proved. the squad was forced to work on their colie
siveness as a team.
Due to 11iis. the- starts and finishes have been the
team's greatest challenge this season, and although
thex improved their finish at the Pacific 10 Champi
onships, the\ are still working on mastering their
starts.
"Our performance at feniple was much better
than at Pac-lOs, said head coach Wieslaw kuclja.
"We executed a better race, and although we had a
more aggressive start at leniple over Pac-lOs, there
is still a problem. As the season progresses, we con
tinue to improve. As a team we've welcomed new
laces, new people and new places, w hic h is one rea
son w In the beginning ol this season was so tough.
The team has had ven productive practices in the
davs leading up to Nationals. Saturday s practice was
the most successful, as the\ held 1,000- and I,:)()()-
meter mock races and saw greatly improved times.
At Nationals, the (Cardinal strategy will be to excel
in the preliminary heats, and especial!) the
repechage. Their goal is to advance to the semi-finals,
and then the finals.
Although winclx conditions max plax a factor in
their performance, the xarsitx eight experienced
similar conditions at Nationals lasi year and is there
lore familiar with the course and conditions.
"Throughout season, although we'xe felt really
c lose-, we've alw ax s been a bit oil. said senic>r captain
Michael Knglish. "However, now we arc linallx feel
ing as if we are on track, and antic ipate a strong per
formance at Nationals.''
