### TIM KANE STAFF WRITER 
After defeating Alabama on Sunday, 16-6,
Stanford may have the schedule to thank as
much as its own bats.
Thanks to the unforgiving tournament
format, which is structured so that the loser of
the undefeated teams' game Saturday has to
win three times in a row to win the Regional,
the second game was made almost a moot
point.
Stanford hitters teed off on Alabama's ex
hausted pitchers, the majority of whom had
already pitched at some point over the week
end and simply didn't have enough gas left in
the tank to 112 inish off the Cardinal.
Even though the format allowed his team
to win, Stanford head coach Mark Marquess
isn't a big fan of the set-up. ()ver the course of
the weekend, the coach spared no opportuni
ty to vilify the new structure, implemented
last year for the first time.
"To have a four-team Regional in three
days is ridiculous," said Marquess. "It doesn't
make any sense to me. Nobody here sched
uled a double-header all year, but now you
could play two in two days."
In past years the baseball championships
included 48 teams playing in eight six-team

regionals, with all the regional winners di
rectly advancing to the College World Series.
Last year, in the hopes of raising the
game's profile (and making a little extra cash),
the NCAA bumped the number of teams in
cluded from 48 to 64 and increased the num
ber of regionals to lb, but with lour teams in
each. Ihe winners of all the regionals now
meet in a "super regional" round which is a
basic 2-out-of-'l series. The winners finally
move on to Omaha for the eight-team, dou
ble elimination CWS.
Super Regionals "are totally different, be
cause you flip back into what everybody's
used to," said Marquess. "Coaches love it.
That is what we play all year, best twoofthree.
It's a regular weekend and if you get to the
College World Series you have even more
time to rest your pitching. You have to have
good pitching depth to get toCWS."
Borchard saves face
Apparently for Joe Borchard, saving face
in the dugout can serve as pretty good moti
vation to knock one out of the park.
"I was trying to cover my neck from my
lack of production earlier in the game," Bor
chard said. "I was the main c ulprit for our in
ability to score in our early opportunities. 1
didn't want to go back in to that dugout it 1

struck out again."
It can safely l)t' said that Borchard's neck
was covered after Saturday's game with the
Crimson Tide. With Stanford down by three
runs in the top of the ninth inning, the junior
centei fielder turned on a fastball up in the
strike /one from Alabama righty Brice Heath
and deposited it over the right centerfield
fence. The three-run homer tied the game at
six.
Borchard also had a two-run bomhcarlici
in the sixth inning, giving him five RBIs on
the day, and leaving quite an impression on
Alabama head coach Jim Wells, who referred
to Borchard as "one of the best players in the
country."
Borchard was named the regional's Most
Outstanding Player after Sunday's second
game, primarily on the strength of his 3-for
5, two home run, five RBI performance on
Saturday; he was 4 for 13 in the rest of the se
ries with only one RBI. On the season, Bor
chard leads the team with 18 homers and 71
RBI, to go with a .328 average and a team
leading .634 slugging percentage.
"Nobody cared as long as we won the game
today, especially after losing the first one,"
said Borchard. "We just wanted to get a win
was the main thing. It is a nice honor to be
recognized for bow we played this weekend."
