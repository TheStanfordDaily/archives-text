Stanford students love the spring, and Stanford's
campus, with its open spaces, trails and paths, provides
ample opportunities lor students to enjoy the California
sun. I niversity President (ierhard (lasper said he him
self enjoys the beaut) of the I niversity, doubting if any
other campus has as "much wonderful open space as
ours."
The development and conservation ol this land,
some 8,180 acres in all, has caused much debate and dis
cussion recently. As the I niversity grows, it faces many
issues involving expansion and land use.
"Stanford has kept more open space than anybody

else on t lie Peninsula," Casper said.
" The rest of the Peninsula wants us to keep our open
spaces forever," he said. "So I think, in part, the prob
lem we are faring at present is due to the fact that we
have been such good and conscientious guardians and
stewards of our land."
Casper, during his eight-year presidency, has had
multiple opportunities to practice his stewardship over
Stanford's lands. I le lias faced the conservation of the
Foothills, the development of Sand Hill Road and the
construction of new housing, among others.
Lynn ()n, dean oft he School of'Kartli S< iences, com
mends Casper's eflorts: "I lis contribution to the man
agement of the Dish area will, in the long run, benefit
both the University and the surrounding community."

Protecting the Foothills
(Jasper's contribution came most recently in the form
of his May 2 conservation and use plan for the Stanford
Dish area. I lis three-part plan deals with erosion of the
Foothills, as well .is problems with parking, traffic and
safety.
Carol Hoggs, director of the- Stanford Center for
('.onset vat ion Hiology, told I lie I )aily earlier this month
of the need for land restoration due to heavy overuse.
"If people go off the trail, it is very difficult to do any
kind of restoration," she said.
Casper agreed, citing joggers and hikers who stra\
from paths as one cause of the degradation. I lie new
I >l<in permits use of the Foothills only oil clearly out lined

trails and paths. It also forbids visitors from bringing
dogs, having picnics and planning social events at the
F< >< >t hills.
To help remedy the traffic and parking problems,
('.asper urged Foothill users to walk, ride or take public
transportation to the Dish area.
