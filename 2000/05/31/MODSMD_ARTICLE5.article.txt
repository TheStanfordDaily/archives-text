# Foothills, land issues mark Casper's term

### AMY CHRISTESON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford students love the spring, and Stanford's
campus, with its open spaces, trails and paths, provides
ample opportunities lor students to enjoy the California
sun. I niversity President (ierhard (lasper said he him
self enjoys the beaut) of the I niversity, doubting if any
other campus has as "much wonderful open space as
ours."
The development and conservation ol this land,
some 8,180 acres in all, has caused much debate and dis
cussion recently. As the I niversity grows, it faces many
issues involving expansion and land use.
"Stanford has kept more open space than anybody

else on t lie Peninsula," Casper said.
" The rest of the Peninsula wants us to keep our open
spaces forever," he said. "So I think, in part, the prob
lem we are faring at present is due to the fact that we
have been such good and conscientious guardians and
stewards of our land."
Casper, during his eight-year presidency, has had
multiple opportunities to practice his stewardship over
Stanford's lands. I le lias faced the conservation of the
Foothills, the development of Sand Hill Road and the
construction of new housing, among others.
Lynn ()n, dean oft he School of'Kartli S< iences, com
mends Casper's eflorts: "I lis contribution to the man
agement of the Dish area will, in the long run, benefit
both the University and the surrounding community."

Protecting the Foothills
(Jasper's contribution came most recently in the form
of his May 2 conservation and use plan for the Stanford
Dish area. I lis three-part plan deals with erosion of the
Foothills, as well .is problems with parking, traffic and
safety.
Carol Hoggs, director of the- Stanford Center for
('.onset vat ion Hiology, told I lie I )aily earlier this month
of the need for land restoration due to heavy overuse.
"If people go off the trail, it is very difficult to do any
kind of restoration," she said.
Casper agreed, citing joggers and hikers who stra\
from paths as one cause of the degradation. I lie new
I >l<in permits use of the Foothills only oil clearly out lined

trails and paths. It also forbids visitors from bringing
dogs, having picnics and planning social events at the
F< >< >t hills.
To help remedy the traffic and parking problems,
('.asper urged Foothill users to walk, ride or take public
transportation to the Dish area.

Sand Hill Road construction
Another controversial issue re
garding land use during Casper's
tenure lias centered around Sand
1 lill Road. In IW2 die I iiiversii\
first propositi widening Sand Hill
to four lanes and building develop
ments alongside it.
I'he proposal incited protests
among resident s of Menlo Park and
I'alo Alto as well as extensive cam

regarding land use.

tenure.
In his ()(toller 1 *)*)7 Slate of the

clared that "the short supply ol
housing near campus is perhaps the
greatest foreseeable threat to the
I Diversity's future liecause it se
verely handicaps recruitment and
retention of the lac ulty and staff the
I Diversity needs."
lu response, the University,
under Casper's tenure, has start

student housing near Ksconclido
Village and residences for faculty
and staff along Sand I Ml Road.
In his last State of'lie 111 versity

The future
Though he dismisses the pos
sibility of construction in the core
part of campus in the near future,
Casper explains that the Univer
sity may one clay have to develop
more land, "because otherwise
we stop growing and we stop
being able to maintain our quali

state, lor the country, for every
one."

that all 8,180 acres are in good
hands. "I think Stanford will. .. as it

else on t lie Peninsula," Casper said.
" The rest of the Peninsula wants us to keep our open
spaces forever," he said. "So I think, in part, the prob
lem we are faring at present is due to the fact that we
have been such good and conscientious guardians and
stewards of our land."
Casper, during his eight-year presidency, has had
multiple opportunities to practice his stewardship over
Stanford's lands. I le lias faced the conservation of the
Foothills, the development of Sand Hill Road and the
construction of new housing, among others.
Lynn ()n, dean oft he School of'Kartli S< iences, com
mends Casper's eflorts: "I lis contribution to the man
agement of the Dish area will, in the long run, benefit
both the University and the surrounding community."

Protecting the Foothills
(Jasper's contribution came most recently in the form
of his May 2 conservation and use plan for the Stanford
Dish area. I lis three-part plan deals with erosion of the
Foothills, as well .is problems with parking, traffic and
safety.
Carol Hoggs, director of the- Stanford Center for
('.onset vat ion Hiology, told I lie I )aily earlier this month
of the need for land restoration due to heavy overuse.
"If people go off the trail, it is very difficult to do any
kind of restoration," she said.
Casper agreed, citing joggers and hikers who stra\
from paths as one cause of the degradation. I lie new
I >l<in permits use of the Foothills only oil clearly out lined

trails and paths. It also forbids visitors from bringing
dogs, having picnics and planning social events at the
F< >< >t hills.
To help remedy the traffic and parking problems,
('.asper urged Foothill users to walk, ride or take public
transportation to the Dish area.

Sand Hill Road construction
Another controversial issue re
garding land use during Casper's
tenure lias centered around Sand
1 lill Road. In IW2 die I iiiversii\
first propositi widening Sand Hill
to four lanes and building develop
ments alongside it.
I'he proposal incited protests
among resident s of Menlo Park and
I'alo Alto as well as extensive cam
paigning lor and against measures
regarding land use.

Knvironinental impad reports
showed otherwise, saving that the

I hese debates eventuall) led to

and approved in 1'.) ( .)7 alter what

Adequate, inexpensive
housing a challenge
I lie ( hallengc <>l supplving acle

quale and inexpensive housing has
also sm laced during Casper's
tenure.
In his ()(toller 1 *)*)7 Slate of the
I niversit) address, Casper de
clared that "the short supply ol
housing near campus is perhaps the
greatest foreseeable threat to the
I Diversity's future liecause it se
verely handicaps recruitment and
retention of the lac ulty and staff the
I Diversity needs."
lu response, the University,
under Casper's tenure, has start
ed construction ol new graduate
student housing near Ksconclido
Village and residences for faculty
and staff along Sand I Ml Road.
In his last State of'lie 111 versity
address, Casper stated ib.r upon
his inauguration, lie '<< i , 1 ~ >t pos
sihh have predicted tl .vould
spend much of iny pn light
ing lor the very right to ' uild facul
t\ and stall housing in Stanford
West, to build graduate student
housing... in short, to keep the
Founders' 'paramount purpose'

alive."
1 he background for this struggle
lias Ih-cii Stanford's Ceneral Use
Permit, an agreement with Santa
(Kara county limiting how many
square feet Stanford can builcl over
the next ten years. Stanford has sub
mitted a new proposal, because the
old permit expires this fall.
The future
Though he dismisses the pos
sibility of construction in the core
part of campus in the near future,
Casper explains that the Univer
sity may one clay have to develop
more land, "because otherwise
we stop growing and we stop
being able to maintain our quali
ty. And that clearly is very impor
tant for the University, for the
state, lor the country, for every
one."
(lasper leaves confident, though,
that all 8,180 acres are in good
hands. "I think Stanford will. .. as it
has in the past... be very, very care
ful about the way it uses its lands."
