Editor's Xote: The u'ords and images
in this section are a compilation of
ideas from m\sel/ and collected /ram
various community members. (,iven
the artistic focus of this project, the for
mat is atypical of standard Daily style.
The hollow glow of
sireetlights replaced
the moon, casting
shadows from the side
walk to the street. I tin ned onto
the Row filled with its aristocratic
houses and well-inanicured
lawns.
I heard them then: the sounds
of metal hitting metal, and the ac
companying human noises of ap
prehension and excitement. In
sure it I should speed lip or slow
down, the surreal shapes dressed

in ihi( k shadows began to emerge
lr< >m the darkness in concrete im
ages reyealinga crowd beginning
to gather around the shell ol an
old car, parked on the lawn of
one of the enlarged dollhouses
that line the Row.
I have grown used to carrying
mv camera everywhere, and my
film was high speed, 3,200, so I
didn't need to draw attention to
myself with a flash.
1 his project was born on that
lawn, in that night, under tran
shumanistic noises and the intre
pid vision of a fraternit) initiation
process. W hen 1 told people 1 was
photographing night life they
would generally laugh and say,
"What night life?" Hut night life is
here, real and strange in a way
that ii will probably never again

Time's waters are hurriedly washing away these days.
So take a moment 112 rom your crowded, sunlit lifetimes
to howl at the moon with like-minded souls. Tonight
we will lounge, drink wine, on cheese and sweets we'll
dine, as we watch the moon shine. So on this night by
the moon so bright, 'twould bring us delight if you ac
cept our invite . . . gifts, in the form of bottles or song,
are always welcome, so bring them along.
