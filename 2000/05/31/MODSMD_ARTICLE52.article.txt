# Work documents student night life
## 
### EMILY YATES-DOERR EDITORIAL STAFF 
When 1 first started this photogra
phy project, my theme was "Stanford
Night Life." I planned to go to every
community that I could iliink of an
photograph their acti\itit*sat night.
I was going to revisit freshman
dorms and photograph classic fresh
man dorm rituals. I was going to go to
African-American, Asian-American
and Jewish fraternities and sororities,
to Club I jamaa, Okada Ilvpe, toga
parties, tlit' 24-hour siud\ room, the
I residdei Lair and anything and
everything else I could find. I wanted
to photograph people playing frisbee
golf, going steamtunneling, studying
and drinking.
After a short time, the reality of
c lasses and work set in and I c hanged
my theme to "night life." At the same
time, the theme "night life' implies
that these pictures are somehow rep
resentative of the night lile on cam
pus. As many of my pictures reflect, I
am a white female from the (Mass of
2000 who lives in .1 campus co-op.

While this is more than siinpU a doc
umentary of lnv night lile, 1 do not
mean to present this as a portrayal <>l
all of Stanford's nighttime communi
ties.
I 'his montage of photographs was
selected from thousands of images for
the purpose of show ing that while we
attend an academic institution, onl\ ,1
fraction of our experience is lex the >nL
An\ Stanford student could have
probablv put together a collection <>l
images as ec lectic as these, had he or
she taken as many photographs as I
did in the past quarter. While the con
tent and student groups may differ
significantly, the insanity of this time
in our lives and the fervor and inten
sity of this institution is a characteristic
of college night life.
While this is undoubtedly a per
sonal photo collection, 1 ultimately
chose to print these images to
demonstrate that activities like these
pla\ a crucial role in our develop
ment as members of groups and as
individuals.



I am fascinated by and have so much respect for the natural world
that it makes me think that 1 should be enthusiastic about learn
ing why the moon changes, why sunrises are so beautiful and
how our brains are allowed to interpret physical images and
enjoy them. The initial questioning process, which leads to scientifi
cally backed reasons for these phenomena, interests me.
However, getting down to the microscopic "nitty gritty" of, let's say,
how our retina reads colors, brings me too far into abstraction. This in
tangibility both intimidates me and makes me laugh. It intimidates me
because I cannot envision what we are studying, it makes me laugh be
cause it also makes me realize that understanding the natural world
(although it is the just passion of some) is a task too big . . . nature is
bigger than man, and it has been man's historical arrogance to think
that he can understand it and tame it.
My hat goes oil to the people that have dedicated their lives to this
understanding, for they have brought many beneficial changes to all
of humanity by being able to understand nature and tap into its power
lor our commodities. 1, however, prefer to simply enjoy the stars by
staring at them with my eyes slightly unfocused (as I did when I was
young) as opposed to understanding why they shine.
