Sometimes at night, when lights are low and colors dim, the world looks black and white and we are all but differ

Don't let people know
you're not as drunk as they
are. Don't let people know
you're more arunk than
they are. Pressure to live in
the moment and succeed
in the future. Pressure to
act spontaneous, ecstatic
and erratic and be togeth
er, organized, on time.
We wait silently to ex
plode, forgetting it ends
with a nearly unnoticeable
whimper.
