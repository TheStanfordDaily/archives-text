EMILY YATES-DOERR/Tlie Stanford Daily
Does he know I keep
him in my peripheral vision.
Does she know I'm staring at her.


EMILY YATES-DOERR, The Stanford Daily
You don't understand that I'm not like this. That
I am strong and rare and do not unfold to just
anyone. You do not realize I am different and
smarter than love or lust. While the playing
fields were equal, we could both avoid looking
at each other's eyes. Although we could not see
each other, things were okay. Now I am looking
at you and watching you look away. How
painful is it to learn that I am not made of stone?
That intelligence of whatever kind I have does
not keep me out of internal soap operas. That I
feel things I want, and yet do not want, to wish
away.


EMILY YATES-DOERR/The Stanford Daily
It's still the stage where touch is fire and you
can burn me with your eyes. The other day you
put your hand on the back of my knee and I
melted into myself. What do I do if you start to
become real — I didn't plan for that. How do I
flee back into myself? When did I slip into a
dream? I did not notice the coming of night.


EMILY YATES-DOERR/The Stanford Daily
How well have I kept myself hidden? Enough so
that this thing, this person, I call myself does not
even exist. How easy to play a role, to act out
life in steps of pretending. Can I make myself
who I want to be through determination, repeti
tion? Practice my personality long enough until
myself is gone or eternally shielded, warped or
dissolved.
