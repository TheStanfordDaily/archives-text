We saw the last em
bers of daylight
die, and in the
trembling blue
green of the sky a moon, worn as
if it had been a shell, washed by
time's waters as they rose and fell
J
about the stars and broke in days
and years.
â€” W.B. Yeats




EMILY YATES-DOERR/The Stanford Daily
Often I find that I replace words
with pictures. I forget that memories
are a little like fingernails; if they
didn't fade away then they would
wear you down.
