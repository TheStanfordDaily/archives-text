# Going boldly forth with a mission

ADRIAN KHACTU

When I was speaking at my high school
graduation oh so main years ago, I incor
porated the vision and voices of Star I rek
into my pep talk about Red River High
School. (Yeah, well, I didn't choose the
name <>l the school either. Co Roughrid
ers!)
Kveryone else had these lame speeches
with melodramatic pauses: "Commence
ment ... is not an end . . . but rather ... a
beginning, like the word commence." But
I wowed the crowd with my delightful
Scottish huri and Shatneresque acting. ()r
,it least, that's how I like to remember it.
li s funn) the things we choose to re
member. Kven though my high school
yearbook was signed "Kriends 4Kver!" in

the margin ofevery page, 1 barely keep up
with more than a few friends from way
back. 1 mean, just the other day, 1 was rem
iniscing about this scrape my friends Daw
son and Pacey got into, until Felicity.
Not that I ever watch TV at school,
Mom.
Looking back at my high school speech,
I really thought my Enterprise metaphor
was apt. I o me, going off to school in (ial
ifornia had to be the final frontier. A place
where I would explore new worlds and
meet new c ivilizations. And while 1 have
taken CSlOtiX and met people from
SoCal, I wonder it I've truly "boldly gone
where no one has gone before."
When it comes right down to it, I'd be

hard-pressed to decide which Stai 1 rek
best represents Stanford. I mean, Presi
dent Casper makes a good I'icard, with
his Teutonic humor a good match for
Patrick Stewart's Shakespearean elocu
tion.
But Stanford does feel a lot like Voy
ager. Trapped in a tin can, hurtling
through space, you and your mot lev < rev\
constantly learn new things because \<mi
can't go home. I hough 1 wish 1 had a
holodeck winter quarter.
Or maybe Stanford's more like Deep
Space Nine. But since I've never wan hed
I)S9, I'd be hard-pressed to make a com
parison.
A friend of mine at another school

(ailed me since she was considering grad
school at Stanford. After I told her about
the bike helmet thing, I realized that it's
hard lor me to define what exactly Stan
ford is. It's more than the teachers and the
new Bing Wing couches. It's more than
the amazing friends I've made singing or
performing or writing or silting around
the dorm lounge. It's more than being
confronted with peers of every color, size
and creed.
And it's definitely not about finishing
up in 12 nice and neat quarters with an A
iu vom major. Its not about learning just
enough to pass vour tests. Or believing
that your learning only takes place in the
classic >om.

1 guess if I had to de
scribe what Stanford is,
I'd say it's about going
boldly forth with a mis

sion. To seek out new planets and new c iv
ilizations, redefining and exploring our
true final frontier: the future. And maybe,
just maybe, getting frisky with a green
skinned alien along the way.

Adrian is finally graduating (and boy is liis
Mom proud) with a degree in English until an
