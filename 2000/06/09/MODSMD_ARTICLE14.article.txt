# Going through the alphabet of college wisdom

LAUREN RUSSELL

1 (sentimentality weren't already saturat
ing the damp air, 1 would he inspired to
write a nostalgic goodbye piece after
Wednesday night's Senior Dinner in the
rain. Despite whatever that was we were
served ("Chicken Medley Surprise "), it was
the perfect way to wrap up four too-short
years on the Farm â€” wetly, drunkenly and
loudly.
Alter receiving 200 or so graduation
cards from long lost cousins in Tennessee,
all of which have inspirational stan/as like
"May you follow the horvon into a vast new
sea, so that happy may your life with Jesus
be,' I have decided to restrain Irom passing
on the Hallmark moment wisdom that I
have shared recently. Instead, 1 will pass on
the advice tli.it I have given to m\ little sis
ter, as she is .i mere fresh man-to-be this fall.
Some general advice: Don't wear sun
screcti, li has been proven to maintain a
I >, ist \ white glow, and by the time we are old,
wrinkles and skin cancer had better be ob
solete.
Fat mangoes often, simply because they
,ti e luscious and juicy.
And don't skim*) clip in Fake Lig at the
end of spring quarter because green slime
does not belong'down there'. Now to the al
phabet of college wisdom I v\islt I had real
ized sooner...

ACADEMICS
(this only comes first because it begins
with an A)
Despite the popular rumor, school is re
ally about developing meaningful friend
ships and that cliche "sucking the marrow
out of life" action, because our transcripts
will not be there to snuggle with us when we
are lonely on a blustery night, to listen and
cheer for ns when we are so excited about
something we will burst or to comfort us
when someone close to lis dies. Unless you
can get really creative with origami.
As an English major with minorsin (xini
munications and Anthropology, academics
were of ten a 70/30 blend of figuring out how
to stretch a two-page paper into 20 with only
the help of margins wide enough for their
own "Yo momma's so fat" joke and a font
that looks more like it belongs on a 747 jet;
and the Mad 1 .ib fill-in-the-blanks method.
Do you remember Mad Fibs? I will give
a sample paper thesis based on my success
ful Mad Fib approach, then you can make
your own. "My Calvin and Hobbes collec
tion is not really about an imaginative boy
and his stuffed tiger friend, but is really a
symbolic metaphor for the oppression that
the Mongolian I'ygtny Albino Japanese suf
fered as a result of the oppressive influence
of the Eastern Italian immigrant fishermen

while living in Tahiti between March of
1323 and July of 1324. Your turn: [The
book your paper is on] is not really about the
[actual plot of book], but is really a symbolic
metaphor for the [emotion, preferably op
pression] that the [minority subculture in a
country with less than 10,000 occupants]
are experiencing as a result of the oppres
sive influence of the [larger minority subcul
ture] during [time period, preferably out of
teacher's area of expertise].
BEAUTY
Dorm room decorating 101. If a dorm
room has any decor whatsoever beyond vast
supplies of electronic equipment , a woman
surely lives there.
A man's sparse decor can always be taken
to a higher level, however, and is distin
guishable by what I've termed the "box"
theme: a wide array of'antique Jack in the
box leftovers, boxers hanging all over the
furniture and iloor and Dominos pizza
lw)xes.
Some of my male friends called me over
to see their new suite "decorations" earlier
this year, and when I arrived I was directed
toward a fine arrangement of empty alcohol
bottles, all lined up with precision on their
light fixture.
This may be related to the fact that some
men find fori Spelling gorgeous.

CAREERS
Never won*)' about getting a job, as there
are plenty ofwasteofmoney.com (yes, this is
a real site) startups dying to offer you one. I
have recently invested in plenty of wasteof
money.coms, although I chose my future
job based on the simple fact that my boss-to
be told me in the interview that we actually
plan to make profit instead of lose vast
amounts of venture capital money.
Once you have a job, remember what a
friend once wrote Senator Paul I sou gas
upon his retirement due to cancer: "No
man has ever said on his deathbed 1 wish I
had spent more time in the office.' "
THE MEANING OF LIFE
When 1 entered Stanford in the fall of
1996, my weekly list of things to do looked
something like "Save the Human Race, ex
cluding Dan Quayle" and "Save the Planet."
By winter quarter, the list of things to do
looked something like "sleep" and "party
often." The character Monty Python cap
tured an essential truth about the meaning
of life when he stated, "and now for some
thing completely different."
CENTIPEDES AND MILENNIAL BUGS
1 lie last class to graduate from Stanford
with the big double 0 brand were not only

too early to even dream
of iht* Internet age, Inn
had yet to fly in a plane,
watch a movie or I V
show or begin to con

ceive of space travel. Many probably
showed up for graduation with a trail of
horse manure following behind them (al
though 11 lat may be something we have in
common). 1 hope to know many of my se
nior classmates until 1 ain a senior citizen,
although I won't be seeing any of you at
the reunions, as I fear that 1 will be chased
down by the big scary guy from the post
office, who I think has been turned into a
hit man for the candle removal agency
(sometimes referred to as Housing and
Dining Services). Not only did 1 recently
receive a very threatening letter stating
that the "candle found in room 121 must
be removed from campus immediately
or you will receive fines of $175 a day,"
but I will soon have a $30,000 fine for not
de-lofting my bed to the right level.
Maybe my wasteofmoney.com stock will
actually go somewhere by then, and thir
ty grand will be spare change.
