I think it would be impossible to succinct-
Iv express the multitude of emotions that
I've experienced (lin ing m\ senior year at
Stanford. When I reflet t on the conglomer
ation <>112 11iv thoughts, though, one fad
emerges: I am nothing it not conflicted
about lea\ing this place.
Ina sense I have been ready to graduate
— to begin the lest of mv life — for the en
lire vear. I' 1" at the same time, I can t lath
on i not being in ((>llcge; loi the first time in
m\ life I will (ease to be a student, and I
know < hange will require an adjustment.
I'licre are ccrtainh things about Stan
ford that I will not miss. I think most promi
nent among these is the overwhelming
locus on a particular type of success.
I recent Iv spoke with someone who
eai ned S.XO an hour last summer as a soft
ware programmer. Not only did he think
that Ins employers underpaid him, lie also
seemed surprised b\ the concept that not all
(i illege graduates (an expect to make any

where near his salary.
I've grown tired of hearing stories of
twentysomething millionaires who expect to
relire before they turn 40, as if we should all
strive loi thai kind of'career. I he thing that
bothers me the most about this way of think
ing is that so often, people on the fast-track
can't reali/e tli.it a very limited number of
careers have the potential to bring about
such financial success. It seems unfair to me
that someone who devotes his or her life to
public service can hardly hope to earn
enough money to afford Bay Area housing,
let alone even dream of stock options. The
predominance of the nouveau-yuppie
mindset on campus — and in Silicon Valley
as a whole — has made me anxious to leave.
I grieve that the notion of college as a place
of learning rather than simply as a gateway
to riches isbecotning hard to find.
Yet despite tny frequent frustration with
"the \v;i\ things are," there are a tremen
dous number of things that I will sorely miss

about Stanford. Most notable is the unparal
leled ability to be able to c laim as my peers so
many amazing students. I know that the
most difficult thing about leaving will be the
loss of daily contact with such large numbers
of people with whom I can discuss art and
science, politics and philosophy.
It's hard for me to come to terms with the
knowledge that next year I will be leaving
this all behind. In one sense 1 look forward
to the heterogeneity of the outside world
compared to that of Stanford. At the same
time, there's something unmatched about
being surrounded by people with whom I
potentially have so much in common.
The other day I was skimming through
the photo albums that document my time in
college. Doing so evoked an overwhelming
wave of nostalgia. Looking back on my
freshman year, I could mentally recreate the
thoughts that went through my head as I
posed for each picture. I began to realize ex
actly how much I've changed since arriving

here four years ago, and how formative
Stanford has been in that transformation.
Following the course of the past four
years also made me regret not taking ad
vantage of some of the opportunities th.it
presented themselves along the way. ()neof
my drawmates recently put it best in saying
that each quarter at Stanford has been like a
c lean slate, a c hanc e to ac hieve all of one's
goals and consummate the educational ex
perience. Inevitably, though, it is impossible
to completely meet one's expectations. She
views leaving college as a marker of the end
of furt her opportunities to attain perfection.
I takea more optimistic view. I think that
regardless of unmet goals, everyone here
has donated to the community around
them in their own way and helped to make
Stanford w hat it is, for better or for worse. I
have met some incredible, spec ial people in
in)' four years here, and 1 feel that because
m\ Stanford experience was touched by
them, mv life lias been inimeasiirablv bet

tered. Here I have en
countered brilliant schol
ars, devoted activists and
gifted leaders, and I will
be eternally greatful for

the impact they have had
on my own personal development.
I sincereh believe that for each of those
people who live in their self-contained world
of success, there exists someone here who is
truly devoted to using his or her own life to
make unique contributions to society. Years
112 rom now when I think back on college, it is
these people whom I will remember. De
spite my underlying eagerness t< > move on,
at this point in time, it is they who are mak
ing leaving Stanford extremelv difficult.
