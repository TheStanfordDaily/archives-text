# Writing the much needed thank-you note home
## 
### 
JIM TANKERSLEY

As any of my relatives will attest, I was
never any gcxnl at thank-you notes.
Christmas morning would come, I'd rip
through package after package, toss the
wrapping somewhere in my mother's gen
eral direction and, when it was all over, hus
tle off to assemble a new Lego set or intro
duce the old action figures to the new ones.
Often, after opening a gift, I'd call out,
"Thanks Aunt Nancy!" Loud. As if she could
hear from her house in Central Oregon.
That pretty much did it for the thank-yous.
It was a bad habit, one that has unfortu
nately continued into my college years. And
it needs to stop. Today. With this column.
For these reasons:
Because Stanford starts and ends your
undergraduate career by calling your name

— first over loudspeakers at your freshman
dorm, then from a microphone at your de
partmental graduation. It doesn't ever call
your parents' names, though.
Because my parents were kind and
thoughtful enough to begin saving for their
kids' education before they even had kids.
Because they read to me every night when I
was young. ITiey bought books and took my
brother and me to the library 011 summer af
ternoons. Because, on those same summer
afternoons, they told us to play outside, to
use our imaginations, to put down the Nin
tendo controllers and do something to build
our minds. Because when the elementary
school didn't have the money or the staff to
help several kids build their minds outside
of the regular curriculum, my mom volun

teered to lead an enrichment program for
several hours each week. Because when
their oldest son, perhaps the worst athlete of
his entire class, decided he wanted to be a
Major League second basemen, then an
NFL quarterback, then an NBA point
guard, they drove him to practice and came
to his games and tossed the ball in the front
yard until it was too dark to see.
Because when he realized he needed
some new career aspirations, they didn't
laugh or say I told you so. Because they en
dured four years of"Can't I just go to college
now?" and two years of "What college
should 1 go to?" and two torturous months
of "Will 1 get in?" And it was dad who on his
lunch break chased down the mailman, who
was running late, so that we could open the

envelope together. Because they helped pile
all my stuff in boxes and drove it 12 hours
down Interstate 5, unloaded and unpacked
it, then gave hugs and drove away.
Because for that first year 1 wasn't the
!x*st at returning their calls unless 1 had
some kind of emergency. Because in one of
those times of emergency, after scoring a
whopping 47 out of 100 on my first Stanford
test, 1 called home in tears and got this re
sponse: "Are you learning anything?" "Yes."
"Are you working hard?" "Yes." "Then
don't worry about your grades."
Because they took interest in what I was
studying, read the b<x>ks 1 passed onto
them, offered advice on research papers
and slugged their way through a 90-page
honors thesis. Because they supported my

insane decision to spend
HO hours a week editing a
college newspaper.
Because, when I
t ailed home Wednesday

to report I was done with college forever, my
dad said "congratulations," as it 1 had ac
complished something big on my own.
Because I didn't do it on my own.
And because they've never once asked
for anything in return.
Thanks mom and dad.
