RANDY MANO

ladies and (ientlemen of the Academy:
fhank you for this very high honor. I am
utterly speechless as 1 stand before the
throngs of others recognized by the elite
Academy members of Stanford L niversity.
Being given the award of bachelor of arts in
economics and bachelor of science in biolo
gy means so much to me. I am especially ap
preciate for the Ac ademy's fair and gentle
hand that bestowed a"tie" for Best Stanford
Graduate to all members of the Class of
2000. It deserves special recognition in this
era of growing competitiveness.
1 have many people to thank for bringing

me to this point. First and foremost, 1 owe a
huge debt of gratitude to my loving parents,
Henry and Darlene. Their constant guid
ance and support throughout my life —
from Aug. 14, 1978 through today — have
proven to be a valuable, underrecogni/.ed
resource for my academic, social and cultur
al enrichment. Without such wondrous role
models, 1 would likely have been content to
attend a college such as UC-Berkeley.
Similarly, I would like to thank the rest of
my family for inspiring me to aim for this
Stanford award. 1 have tried to provide
words of wisdom to my younger brother,

John, who has indeed grown into a confi
dent teenager with one powerful tennis
game. Nana, Arlene, Kenneth, Kenny and
Michi have likewise urged me to aim high
and work hard through phone calls and
personal visits to the Stanford campus.
This now brings me to the friends 1 have
made at Stanford. You know who you are.
In times of stress relief, 1 have shared with
you my experiences, my secrets, my worries.
I feel that you — and not some obscure fact
about medieval Km ope or redox chemistry
— will take up the majority of my memories
at Stanford. I wonder how we will l<x)k back

upon our time at Stanford while hovering
under our class tent at the Homecoming
Came in 2030. Only the Shadow knows.
Yes, 1 see the blinking lights. Thirty sec
onds remaining. If anything, I should be
thanking Stanford for the past four years of
my life. I have explored my creative side by
working for Hie Daily's Intermission sec
tion as a dedicated film reviewer; I have also
taken advantage of the 1 lealth Corps and
EPA'IT service programs through the Haas
Center. And, of course, I must not forget
about the coursework. So challenging, and
yet so engaging.

So thank you, Acade
my of Stanford, for
awarding me with this
diploma. 1 wholeheart
edly feel that attending

Stanford is a chance-of-a-lifetime event that
must be enjoyed to its potential by those
lucky enough to grace the sandstone walls.
Randy is gnuluating with Ixulielors degrees in
economics and biology and is a fanner Intermis
sion editor. He is doing a wacky walk inlo the busi
ness culture of San Francisco and wishes the ( Jaw
of2000 the best of luck in the future.
