MONYA DE

1 his week lias been emotional. Intense.
Fun. Expensive (lor the I Diversity, $2
million on commencement activities??)
And for the past lew days, ni\ Stanford life
has been flashing before my eyes, almost as
if leaving the 04! J 05 /ip code will make it
all disappear.
Sure, parts of it were gruesome (i.e.
Chetn 3(i) but what really stands out are
the special days and the fimn\ days that
made this time what it was.for my last
Dailv piece. I'd like to switch over from cri
tic juing plavs and inter\ iewiug scientists to
share my days with you.
I he days that I will remembei . . .
I lie day I ai i ived at Stanlbrd, i iglit oil
a 14-hour plane ride from London, to my
roommate's smiling lace.
The (lav I discovered that the ideal lu

bricant fora rusty bike lo< k is not Vaseline,
not WD-40, but Clinicjue's Dramatically
Different Moisturizing Lotion.
I'lie cla\ I said "I'm going home" and
realized that I had c alled Faisan home.
I'lie first day I saw rain and sunshine
happening at the same time.
I lie clay the power went out during my
Math 12 midterm — my liisi midterm
evei .ii Stanlbrd — and some people in the
room started doing c alculus b\ bike light.
I he day of the Math 12 final. I have
iie\ ei heard so inuc Ii swearing out loud ai
an exam.
I lie clay I got into a discussion with a
homeless man about the ethic s of offering
|(>llll I ravolta $3:"),000 to speak on c am
pus.
flie day the niv resident assistant ran

into our loom the first night of orienta
tion, yelling that the freshman clown the
hall was in her Sports Illustrated.
I lit- day 1 got accepted into Stanford's
program at ()xford.
I lie night of the flood sophomore year,
and the following day, when every class
and test except the I lum Bio midterm was
canceled.
I he night my roommate and I read
CIV books standing on top of our beds.
I lie day we had to do "The Banana
Dane e" and sing for money on Pier 39 for
a scavenger hunt.
1 he day 592 Mayfield caught on fire.
The day I was calling alumni for the
Stanford Ktind and a woman gave $20,000
fora scholarship.
The day I discovered the best library on

campus.
The day they made ns take down the
557 beer wall.
The day two members of the Class of
1974, back for Reunion, asked my room
mate and me to pose fora "Hans Mitt
Room 211, Fast and Present" picture. My
roommate was still in her towel.
The clay Prof. Durham showed the
slide of the Appalachian Bine People in
Hum Bio Core.
The day Tony Kushner spoke at Stan
ford and autographed my AP English pro
ject, an anthology of excerpts from my fa
vorite literature.
The clay I had to buy Target's entire
stock of pillows and twin sheets for all the
Stanford Summer College kids who forgot
theirs.

Fhe day I finished a
one-ad play. And the
day I saw it performed.
We all have enough
to do right now, with

packing, parents, posing tor pictures anci
last-minute chores, but if you have even
five minutes, I would suggest picking up
your planner from 112 reshman or soph more
year. Your hastily scribbled notes might
trigger a memory of a special day or two —
days you'd like to keep with yon long after
your memories of finals and papers have
faded.
