# Lending advice for along the way
## 
### 
MILER LEE

I lie- fiosh in my dorm .ire, unsurpris
ingly, a lot like I was when 1 was their age.
li s around freshman year in college dur
ing which vou gel that sudden realization
that your future is wide open, and that over
the next four years, you'll he shaping that
future. For ;i luc kv few , this translates into
a healthy sense of cc mlidence in all endeav
ors throughout theii college career, for
the rest of us, it's sheer terror.
It consumes us. It drives us to corner
our advisors and RAs to find out what c lass
es to take, w hat to major in or even w hat to
pursue as a c areer. And when we don't get
the answers we want (which is most of the
time), we shift in our chairs nervously, be
cause it is uncomfortable not to gel defini
tive' answers to our questions, and conse
quently not to be able to plan everything

out exactly.
So of course, we try to come up with our
definitive answers on our own, toward
which we invest all of our academic ener
gy. I hen, when parents or peers ask us
about what we're going do with our lives,
we'll be able to give a nice well-scripted re
sponse.
fiut these are often times fragile and
highly short-lived plans, and all it takes is a
couple of bad midterms or a few excruciat
ingly dull lectures for us to say "Wait a sec -
ond, I hate this crap, I don't want todo this
for the rest of my life." And so, the return
to the frightening world of uncertainty.
Yes, that was me three-odd years ago.
1 his year, during dinner-time conver
sations in my dorm, these sorts of issues
tended to surface. When they did, 1 tried

my best to oiler what advice I could and
told tliem not to worry. But it's never terribly
effective to tell someone who's hell-bent on
worrying about something not to worry
about it.
What I really want to do is impart on the
frosh (and others) a small bit of experience,
all at once. So here I go.
To the (former) frosh of Larkin and be
yond:
It's perfectly natural for you to feel as
though your 112 uture plans are as concrete as
banana pudding, li is also perfectly natur
al for this feeling never to go away, or recur
during transitional periods in your life,
such as, say, graduation. What's important
to realize, though, is that you are not a bad
person for feeling this way. No, really.
In retrospect at least, there is nothing

quite as exhillarating as not having any
obligations at all — to a major, to an em
ployer. Learn to appreciate those rare
times when you don't have to live your life
according to a four-year plan.
I think that a lot of times when you try to
impose a set of plans on yourself , you end
up restricting yourself to narrow path to
ward the fulfillment of those plans. Where
does it say that if you want to go into engi
neering, you have to lake 20-plus units of
techie classes per quarter? Allow for ran
dom classes in your schedule. Allow for
some impulsiveness. (Jo fountain hopping
at 3 a.m. instead of cramming for your
exam. It's certainly those sorts of things
that I'll remember when I look back at my
four years.
I was like you once. And to the extent

that I still have no idea
what lies in my future, 1
am still like you. Hi it 1
think I'm okay with that,

and I hope some of that will rub <>H on all
ofyou.
I've learned (hat it's okay to have some
goals, and it's okay not to have any. But no
matter what, it's most important to re
member to live along the way. Enjoy the
next three years.

Miler I re has held far too many jobs at f lic
Daily, but is probably best known for his stint as
bead fihoto/graphics editor a couple of years buck.
He is graduating with a bachelor's degree in
Symbolic Systems, which naturally lends much
credibility to the fad that he's not worried about
his future.
