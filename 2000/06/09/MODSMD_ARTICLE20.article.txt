# Fear not the mundane or the ladies: this I learned

EVAN NORDBY

Four years ago, I stood in tiont of a sub
urban high school gymnasium lull of par
ents and my fellow graduating seniors and
declared that whatever the valuable cash
and prizes promised by the "Real World"
or something called "college," 1 wanted to
stay in high school.
Fhink about it. Mom washes your
crusty football pants while von spend four
years earning what a historian would term
social and political capital, such as exact!)
which double entendres would slip by the
assistant principal on the morning inter
coin announcements or how to score ab
solutely the coolest parking space near vour
first period class. ()li veah, and how to look
up cute girls' schedules in the attendance
office so you could "accidentally" run into
diem during passing time. 1 heard about
that last one from a friend. Yeah.
And suddenly, high school hoots you,
ceremoniously but abruptly, out the door.

Three months later, vou're hauling boxes
up to the third floor of Mo \lo, and no
one is going to even consider touching
your laundry, especialh anything that
could be described as "crusty football
pants."
Now that the end of college is upon
me, I 've been waiting fora similar feeling
of impending doom to drive me back into
the History Cornel for another degree.
And I'm still waiting.
Don't get me wrong. 1 love Stanford.
(Surely another l)ail\ senior will .it this
point expound on their love of Stanford,
and that love will probabK be akin to
mine; read their column also.)
But one ol the best parts about being a
student at Stanford is that I've already
learned, outside t he classroom, a little at a
time, how to conquer the most imposing
things about moving beyond I lie Stan
ford Bubble. And the most imposing are

also I lie everyday.
1 got over my apprehension that I
would get the temperature of the washing
machine a hair off or something, and my
clothes would melt, and I would have to
go to t lass wearing two dining services
trays and a length of duct tape. 1 remem
bered to pav the Visa people; (iuido and
Sonm never came lot inyC.Ds.
And there's nothing like living in <>neof
Stanford's co-ops to teach the art of cook
ing and speeds bathroom (leaning. For
groups of ()0, never do stulled anything
and favor the enormous fr\ grill; a little
I a sol goes <i long v\a\ toward asphyxiat
ing \out sell ,ind vour ( leaning partner.
M\ informal Stanford education also
extended to things a bit more complicat
ed, like women. It is an established lac t at
St an lord that relationships can be defined
in terms usually reserved for the lime
Schedule: "having .i girlfriend is like a

five-unit class."
Well, 1 had a fantastic five-unit class for
two years, but you'd have to ask my pro
lessor for the grade 1 got. 1 also learned
from friends who took everything from
one-unit, pass/no credit tutorials to nine
units of SI .K.
And even more complicated, 1 can
make a Long Island Iced lea that doesn't
taste like rocket fuel. Hut we won't go into
that.
Hut lor all of how this might seem like
sell-indulgent reminiscing, there is an un
derlying principle for which 1 have to be
grateful to the University. Watch out,
there's a serious point ahead.
I'd like to thank Stanford for offering
students practical advice and then letting
them make their own choices, and some
times letting the consequences come right
back and hit them.
With the pressure on universities today

from overprotective,
potentially litigious
parents to return to the
days of in loco parentis,
Stanford should be

commended for continuing to treat
young adults as adults as much as it has.
1 fold the line, Dean (OK, Vice Provost)
Montoya. Keep Stanford the amazingly
enriching place that it is, academically and
socially.
There is one thing though. I never
learned how to concurrently date room
mates, but maybe that was a good thing,
next three years.

Former news managing editor Evan Nordby,
graduating with a doable major in istory with
honors and American Studies, would like to
I hank his family, without whom he could nex'er
have played in the Hand at the Rose Howl among
so vuiny other things. Go Cardinal!
