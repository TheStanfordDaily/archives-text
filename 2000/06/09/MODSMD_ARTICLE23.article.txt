# Top Ten Sports Moments of the Year

### 
The Cardi
nal takes
the field at
the Rose
Bowl after
winning its
first Pac-10
title since
Set up by a dramatic 31-13 win
over Cal, which gave Stanford its
first undisputed Pacific 10 Confer
ence title, Stanford headed to
Pasadena as football's Cinderella
story. Just 3-8 the year before and
unranked for most of the season,
the Cardinal made use of solid
coaching, a talented offense and a
little bit of luck to improve to 8-3
going into the Rose Howl. Despite
predictions of a Wisconsin blow
out, the Cardinal showed grit
throughout the game, with junior
Willie Howard and senior star

Troy Walters taking the field, de
spite injuries. Senior quarterback
Todd Husak, Walters, freslunan
Kerry Carter and junior Mike

liiselli provided offensive sparks
for the Cardinal, but Stanford
couldn't stop Heisman Trophy
winner Ron Dayne or survive Wis

consm's relentless defense. In the
end, the scoreboard read Wiscon
sin 17, Stanford 9 — but for Cardi
nal fans, it was a thrill to get there.

Freshman Laura
Granville and junior
Alex Kim qive the
Cardinal a sweep of
tennis individual titles
just 10 days after
men's tennis wins its
17th national cham
pionship.

Stanford tennis has such a tradition of excellence, it seems like there isn't
much left for the Cardinal to achieve. But Stanford fans were treated to
a first' when Cranville and Kim became the first players in Stanford his-

Tory to give the
Cardinal a sweep
of the NCAA indi
vidual titles. For
Cranville, her win
was bittersweet, as
she defeated Car
dinal teammate
Marissa Irvin, the
nation's No. 1-
ranked player, 6-
0, 6-4. For Kim,

the 6-1,6-1 win over Kentucky's Carlos Drada complimented the men's
team title, won just over a week earlier. Kim played No. 1 singles and
doubles in the 4-0 victory over Virginia Commonwealth. The Stanford
women, returning to the NCAA championship holding last year's title,
finished a 30-1 banner year with a heartbreaking loss in the national title
match to No. 2 Georgia. Ending his career with 10 national titles, 1 3 Pac
-10 championships and a 510-50 record, women's head coach Frank
Brennan announced his retirement. The legendary Brennan will be re
placed by long-time assistant coach Lele Korood, who will look to con
tinue Stanford's winning ways.

Senior Brent Hauser falls across the line in the 10,000 meters to complete a 1 -2-4 Cardinal
finish and set up Stanford's first national title since 1934.

After back-to-back 1-2-3 sweeps of
the 10,000-meter run at the NCAA
championships in 1998 and 1999, an
other sweep looked to be in the works
in Durham, N.C., this year, with se
nior twins Brad and Brent 1 fauser
leading the way. But when Brent
1 lauser began to falter with less than
100 meters remaining, the crowd at
Duke's Wallace Wade Stadium went
into a frenzy. Brad Hauser and Jason
Balkman, crossing first and second,
respectively, turned at the line and
joined in (lie crowd's streaming,
coaxing Brent 112 lauser toward the fin
ish. As Brent's legs gave out in the

final 10 meters, Drake's Jason
Lemkuhle crept up from behind and
crossed in third. Brent twisted his
bod) and thrust himself across the
line, falling to the ground in total ex
haustion as another runner leaped
over his back. I lauser's fourth-place
finish helped the Cardinal amass 23
points in the 10,000 meters, and the
team dedicated its < < Elective cfl< >rts to
winning in honor of Brent's sacrifice.
Two days later, Stanford clinched
the national title as Brad and Brent
went I-4 in the ">,OOO meters and cat
apulted the(Cardinal toa 72-.">9 upset
victory over Arkansas.

Junior Mike McDonald hits back-to-back three pointers to start a 10-
0 Cardinal run in Stanford's 80-79 victory over Duke in overtime.
From the time that the Stanford men's basketball team's 1999-2000 schedule was
announced, it felt like a countdown until the upstart C lai dinal s meeting with pv,ren
ni;Yl'powerh( i >USe''D'uk'( i . 'FM'SMnlord fans, ii had .ill the makings of a crystal-ball
match-up to determine what the upcoming season would hold. With the No. 13
Cardinal returning just one starter, senior Mark Madsen. and memories of the pre
vious year's early-season Sports Illustrated No. 1 -pick curse, no one was sure how
the young team would stack up on the national scene in w hat was deemed by many

a building year. Against the No. 10
Blue Devils, the Cardinal proved it
was a program on the rise. While
freshmen Curtis Borchardt, Casey Ja
cobsen and Jason Collins gave a sneak
peak at the future of Cardinal basket
ball, senior David Moseley and Mc-
Donald took over when Madsen
pulled a hamstring in the final minute
of regulation time. With the team's
most experienced veteran sidelined,
Stanford stepped up in overtime to
edge the Blue Devils, 80-79. The team
went on to earn a No. 1 ranking, cap
ture a share of the conference title and
go 27-4 before falling to North (Caroli
na in the second round of the NCAA
tournament.

Senior Edmund Muth hits a two-run homer to lift the Card over
Nebraska to advance to the College World Series.
Few season outlooks shine as brightly as those of Stanford baseball heading into the 2000
season. Coming off a 50-15 finish that boasted a Pac-10 title and a C>llege \V< irld Series ap
pearance, and returning seven starters and the entire starting pitching rotation, all signs
pointed to a return trip to ()maha for the top-ranked (lardinal. Despite the hype, Stanford
had to earn its way on what sometimes seemed a bumpy road back u > the C AVS. After some
surprise losses early in the season, the Cardinal stayed afloat the national rankings and

showed its strength in Pac-10 play. Stan
ford held off UCLA in a dramatic third
game 17-11 win to capture a share of the
conference title and take momentum into
tournament play. Beating Fresno State
and Alabama to win its Regional, the ('.ar
dinal took on Nebraska at Sunken Dia
mond in its Super Regional. After a 7-3
loss in the first game, Sum ford put togeth
er a 7-1 sec c)nd-game victory t< > stay alive in
the series. Riding the arm of sophomore
Brian Sager in the final game, Stanford
fought hard to hold off the Cornhuskers,
3-2.1 lowever, Mutli broke the game open
in the eighth inning to propel the Cardinal
to a 5-3 win and send fans rushing to pur
chase tickets to ()maha, where the Cardi
nal will compete in its 12th (IWS.

6 Senior Kerri Walsh posts 1 1 kills in the last game
of her career as Stanford falls to Penn State, 3-0,
in the NCAA volleyball championships.
You had to hand it to Penn State. The top-ranked
Nittany Lions made quick work of the five-time nation
al champion Stanford women's volleyball team in tlk-
NCAA title match in Hawaii, posting 15-2, 15-10, 15-7
victories. But on a day in which there seemed to be more regrets
than heroics on Stanford's side of the net, Walsh showed poise and
leadership in her last match for the Cardinal. Adding NCAA Co-Na
tional Flayer of the Year to a long list of honors, she capped a stellar
career that included two NCAA titles, three Final Four appearances
and four Pac-10 titles. Despite several early-game errors, Walsh
helped the Cardinal to rally back after a 4-0 Penn State run. I lowev
er, momentum was never really on Stanford's side and in what
seemed almost a bad dream, the Cardinal's title hopes were over be
fore it ever found its rhythm. Even with an influx of new talent that
includes freshman phenom Logan Tom, Walsh leaves big shoes to
fill as one of Stanford's most decorated athletes. Despite the team's
heartbreaking loss, Walsh leaves Stanford as one of the nation's win
ningest players, leading the Cardinal to a 122-1 I record in her time
on the Farm.
7 Junior Adam Messner wins the 200-meter butterfly
to become Stanford's first individual national titlist
this year and lead men's swimming and diving to a
fourth-place finish.
0.09 seconds made all the difference for Adam Mess
ner and Zsolt Caspar. In a dogfight of a race, Messner
edged South Carolina's Caspar to claim victory in the
final of the 200-meter butterfly in 1:55.79. On the final day of com
petition, Messner took the podium to become Stanford's first indi
vidual titlist of the year. For the Cardinal, the national meet was a
struggle to prove that it deserved its freshly won Pac-10 title and
could overcome a disappointing start to claim its place among the na

lion's top programs. With three weeks separating the (iardinal's hard
fought victory at the conference meet, Stanford came out sluggish in
day one of the NCAA meet. Fueled by the desire to beat Bay Area-rival
(lal, the C '.ardinal pulled out gutsy performances ovei the next three
days 112 rom Messner and freshmen John Waters and Randall Bal, to fin
ish in fourth place, edging the pesky Colden Bears by only half a
point. While it may not be a national title, the fourth-place finish was
an emotional vic tory for the men's swimming and diving team.
8 Junior Stephanie Keever shoots a hole-in-one to
lift women's golf to a surprise second-place na
tional finish.
Superstitious golfers might consider the 13th hole to
bring bad luck. For Keever, in the second day of NCAA
tournament plav, the 13tli hole of Oregon s Sun River
Coif Course brought an unforgettable moment in her
collegiate career. Keever shot an even-par 72, including a hole-in-one
on the 13th hole to tie the clay's individual low score and help the No.
5 Cardinal climb from sixth lo second place on the final day of com
petition. She finished fifth, while junior teammate Hilary Homeyer
tied for thirteenth, just three strokes behind overall. In a year that
seemed full of tips and downs, the women's golf team wrote a happy
ending for the season. Cardinal fans can look forward to a successful
sequel next year, as Stanford loses only one player, JaeJean Ro, to
graduation.
£ : % freshman Julie Gardner scores an overtime goal
m |j| as women's water polo beats No. 2 Cal, 3-2.
ijLjß 11 you think the rivalry between the Stanford and Cal
W football teams is fierce, you ought to see the Cardinal and
the Golden Bears battle it out in the pool. With both
women's water polo squads consistently ranked in the top
three nationally, any meeting between the two power
houses is sure to make a splash. With seeding for the national cham
pionships decided in the teams' Northern California Regional Quali

fier match-up, there was much more on the line than just school pride.
The match-up proved to be as intense in the pool as it appeared on
paper, with both teams trying to use physical play to gain control of the
low-scoring game. Stanford was first on the scoreboard, scoring two
goals before Cal responded. 1 he Golden Bears mounted a late-game
comeback, tying up the game and sending it into overtime. In a nail
biting overtime period, Gardner ultimately decided the game with a
perimeter shot that sent the tired Cardinal into celebration. Though
the team was knocked out of national title contention with a semifinal
loss to USG, it posted ;i best-ever 28-5 record and all the bragging
rights that go along with beating (lal.
# j Freshman Liz Lanese returns from a stress frac
* 4 ture to score six goals and lead tfie women's
1 lacrosse team to its final Western Women's
9 Lacrosse League title witfi a 12-9 victory over
1| Jr league rival UC-Davis.
At the end of the season, the Stanlbrd women's lacrosse team bid
farewell to the Western Women's lacrosse League. For the rest of the
league, perhaps it was good riddance. In just a tew short years, the Stan
lord program has improved tremendously, outgrowing the limitations of
the WWLL schedule and dominating most West ('.oast opponents. In its
final appearance at the WWLL championships, Stanford faced rival UC-
Davis. The Aggies have been the other WWLL bully and the young Car
dinal hoped to knock off their final league opponent and prove them
selves before heading off to play an independent schedule and work on
qualifying for the NCAA tournament in the future. Each year it seems that
tlie Cardinal's recruiting class gets stronger, and this year's freshman and
sophomores led the way in the title match. Sophomore Caroline Oster
vvise scored two goals and classmates Liz Britt, Sara Lev and Jenny Silver
man and freshman Kim Cahill each chipped in one. Most dramatic,
though, was Linese's return to play despite sustaining a stress fracture.
She powered her way to six goals, igniting the Cardinal on the scoreboard
and paving the way not only for 12-9 victory in the (Cardinal's last WWLL
title appearance, but also for Stanford's future outside the WWLL.
