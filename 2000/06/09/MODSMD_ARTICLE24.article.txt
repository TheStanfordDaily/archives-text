## Hausers, Balkman go 1-2-4 in 10,000 meters 
### BEN ALLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
DURHAM, N.C. — I lie Stanford
men outran, outperformed and sim
ply overwhelmed the competition to
come away victorious at the NCAA
t rack and Field Championships
here last week.
Senior Brad I lauser provided the
bulk of the points and twin brother
Brent provided the inspiration that
powered Stanford past eight-time de
fending champion Arkansas for the
Cardinal's first national title in the
sport since 1034. Stanford scored 72
points to the Razorbacks' . r >9.
"Our guys were just oustanding,"
said head coach Vin Lananna. " The
men's team performed like champi
ons. I am completely overwhelmed."
Brad Mauser's win in the 10,000-
meter run on day two of the four-day
meet got the ball rolling for Stanford,
but it was Brent's dive at the finish
line of that race that sparked the Car
dinal.
Coining off two consecutive years
of 1-2-3 sweeps in the 10,000, Stan
lord looked to be on pace fora three
peat in the event. Brad and Brent
I lauser bolted lor the lead with a kilo
meter to go, and senior Jason Balk
man, who had been racing near the
middle of the pack, made a coura
geous charge to join the twins.
()ver the final half mile, the (Cardi
nal trio pulled away from the pack.
But Brent began to feel lightheaded
with 150 to go, and with 85 meters to
the stripe, his legs started to lock up.
"I saw up on the scoreboard that
we had had three up front," said
Brent Mauser. "I started feeling
dizzy, maybe a little dehydrated. I
tried to let the guys know, but there
was nothing they could do."
Ihe Cardinal runners had
planned to cross the line together,
but with Brent's finish in jeopardy,
Brad Mauser and Balkman had to
bolt for the finish.
"Brent was calling' Mold up, hold
up,' but coach was yelling that anoth
er runner was coining," Brad said.
"We had to go l<>r the team points."
Brad Mauser took the race in .30
minutes, 38.57 seconds, and Balk
man was just back at 30:38.02. But
Drake's |ason Lemkhiile scooted
around Brent I lauser, who appeared
to be dragging his legs toward the
stripe, and took third. Brent's legs fi
nally failed him as he lell flat across
the line in Iburth in 30:42.17, just be
fore another runner leaped over his
back lor fifili place.
Brad helped his brother up at the

line, but Brent had clearly left every
ounce of energy on the track.
"II anyone wasn't moved by
Brent's effort, I don't know what
would move them," Lananna said.
The 1-2-4 finish still stacked 2.S
points for the Cardinal and, com
bined with senior Toby Stevenson's
dramatic clearance of 18 feet, 4 1/2
inches on his final attempt for second
place, Stanford was in solid position
with 3I points.
A heaping helping of points in the
middle distances came next for the
Cardinal. Redshirt junior Michael

Stember c ruised to a school-record
1:40.20 for fourth place in the 800
meters, and a 1-2 finish by redshirt
sophomore Clabe Jennings and
Stember in the 1,500 had the (Cardi
nal fired up fora strong finish.
Jennings and Stember controlled
the pace of the 1,500 for most <>l the
run, but Southern Alabama's David
Kimaui creeper! past Stember late in
the race and looked to be gaining on
Jennings.
Stember wasn't phazed.
"I knew Cabe had the win locked
up, but we were running for 1-2.

I here's only one guy in the nation
who can touch me at 1,500 meters,
and that's (labe," Stemlier said.
When Stember saw Kimani's
stride slow slightly, he pounced. Jam
ming through (lie final 200 meters,
Stember caught kimani and followed
Jennings to the finish, 3:37.76 to
3:39.53 — good for 18 points.
With just the 5,000 remaining, the
stage was set for the Cardinal. After
an hour and 45 minute storm delay,
the I lausers once again toed the line,
this lime* with Jennings and redshirl
sophomore | onathon Riley.
I he pat e was relatively pedestrian
from the gun, with Matt Lane of
William and Mary leading the way.
Kut with (')()() meters to go, the rate
broke, and it was Brad Mauser once
again at the head of the pack.
With Brent Mauser and Riley in
tow, Brad capped off his (lardinal ca
reer with a victory in 13:48.80. Brent
grabbed fourth (13:51.22) and Riley
was sixih (13:54.61). Jennings
brought tlu- Cardinal home in I lib
(14:14.79).
Ihe 18 point i ally sealed the victo
ry for the Cardinal, and another
round m the four-year power strug
gle between the (iardinal and t lit* Ra
/orbacks went to Stanford.
"It's been a war with Arkansas,"
Brat I Mauser said. "We declared war
without win in crosscountry in 1990.
For three years, we've been second to
them in every indoor and outdoor
championship."
But this year was different.
"They had a couple of holes in
their game plan," Stember said ol
Arkansas, who bungled several point
storing opportunities. "We capital
ized on them."
"We've been so hungry for this
title," Jenningssaitl. "Bradand Brent
carried 11 it* torch tonight. After see
ing them in the 10,000, how could I
not give mv utmost effort? 1 tlid it lor
Brad and Brent."
I.ananna was more than im
pressed.
"I'm not sure that anyone can fully
understand how much Brad and
Brent Mauser have really meant to
this program," I.ananna said.
"They've taken our program from
i he middle of the pack to the pinnacle
ofom sport."
With the Mausers, Balkman and
Stevenson all closing out their colle
giate careers in Durham, the Cardi
nal will need to look to the youth to
stay at i hat pinnacle.
But with Jennings, Stember and
Riley returning to form a core with
the likes of freshmen Andy Powell
and Louis Lut hini, who participated
in the NCAA meet in the 1,500 ant I
10,000, respectively, the Cardinal
should be resting high tin the victory
stand for years to come.

around Brent I lauser, who appeared
to be dragging his legs toward the
stripe, and took third. Brent's legs fi
nally failed him as he lell flat across
the line in Iburth in 30:42.17, just be
fore another runner leaped over his
back lor fifili place.
Brad helped his brother up at the

line, but Brent had clearly left every
ounce of energy on the track.
"II anyone wasn't moved by
Brent's effort, I don't know what
would move them," Lananna said.
The 1-2-4 finish still stacked 2.S
points for the Cardinal and, com
bined with senior Toby Stevenson's
dramatic clearance of 18 feet, 4 1/2
inches on his final attempt for second
place, Stanford was in solid position
with 3I points.
A heaping helping of points in the
middle distances came next for the
Cardinal. Redshirt junior Michael

Stember c ruised to a school-record
1:40.20 for fourth place in the 800
meters, and a 1-2 finish by redshirt
sophomore Clabe Jennings and
Stember in the 1,500 had the (Cardi
nal fired up fora strong finish.
Jennings and Stember controlled
the pace of the 1,500 for most <>l the
run, but Southern Alabama's David
Kimaui creeper! past Stember late in
the race and looked to be gaining on
Jennings.
Stember wasn't phazed.
"I knew Cabe had the win locked
up, but we were running for 1-2.

I here's only one guy in the nation
who can touch me at 1,500 meters,
and that's (labe," Stemlier said.
When Stember saw Kimani's
stride slow slightly, he pounced. Jam
ming through (lie final 200 meters,
Stember caught kimani and followed
Jennings to the finish, 3:37.76 to
3:39.53 — good for 18 points.
With just the 5,000 remaining, the
stage was set for the Cardinal. After
an hour and 45 minute storm delay,
the I lausers once again toed the line,
this lime* with Jennings and redshirl
sophomore | onathon Riley.
I he pat e was relatively pedestrian
from the gun, with Matt Lane of
William and Mary leading the way.
Kut with (')()() meters to go, the rate
broke, and it was Brad Mauser once
again at the head of the pack.
With Brent Mauser and Riley in
tow, Brad capped off his (lardinal ca
reer with a victory in 13:48.80. Brent
grabbed fourth (13:51.22) and Riley
was sixih (13:54.61). Jennings
brought tlu- Cardinal home in I lib
(14:14.79).
Ihe 18 point i ally sealed the victo
ry for the Cardinal, and another
round m the four-year power strug
gle between the (iardinal and t lit* Ra
/orbacks went to Stanford.
"It's been a war with Arkansas,"
Brat I Mauser said. "We declared war
without win in crosscountry in 1990.
For three years, we've been second to
them in every indoor and outdoor
championship."
But this year was different.
"They had a couple of holes in
their game plan," Stember said ol
Arkansas, who bungled several point
storing opportunities. "We capital
ized on them."
"We've been so hungry for this
title," Jenningssaitl. "Bradand Brent
carried 11 it* torch tonight. After see
ing them in the 10,000, how could I
not give mv utmost effort? 1 tlid it lor
Brad and Brent."
I.ananna was more than im
pressed.
"I'm not sure that anyone can fully
understand how much Brad and
Brent Mauser have really meant to
this program," I.ananna said.
"They've taken our program from
i he middle of the pack to the pinnacle
ofom sport."
With the Mausers, Balkman and
Stevenson all closing out their colle
giate careers in Durham, the Cardi
nal will need to look to the youth to
stay at i hat pinnacle.
But with Jennings, Stember and
Riley returning to form a core with
the likes of freshmen Andy Powell
and Louis Lut hini, who participated
in the NCAA meet in the 1,500 ant I
10,000, respectively, the Cardinal
should be resting high tin the victory
stand for years to come.

Redshirt junior Michael Stember, shown here in a meet earlier this season,
pulled out a gutsy performance in the 1,500 meters to follow teammate Gabe
Jennings to a 1-2 finish for the Cardinal.
DURHAM, N.C. — I lie Stanford
men outran, outperformed and sim
ply overwhelmed the competition to
come away victorious at the NCAA
t rack and Field Championships
here last week.
Senior Brad I lauser provided the
bulk of the points and twin brother
Brent provided the inspiration that
powered Stanford past eight-time de
fending champion Arkansas for the
Cardinal's first national title in the
sport since 1034. Stanford scored 72
points to the Razorbacks' . r >9.
"Our guys were just oustanding,"
said head coach Vin Lananna. " The
men's team performed like champi
ons. I am completely overwhelmed."
Brad Mauser's win in the 10,000-
meter run on day two of the four-day
meet got the ball rolling for Stanford,
but it was Brent's dive at the finish
line of that race that sparked the Car
dinal.
Coining off two consecutive years
of 1-2-3 sweeps in the 10,000, Stan
lord looked to be on pace fora three
peat in the event. Brad and Brent
I lauser bolted lor the lead with a kilo
meter to go, and senior Jason Balk
man, who had been racing near the
middle of the pack, made a coura
geous charge to join the twins.
()ver the final half mile, the (Cardi
nal trio pulled away from the pack.
But Brent began to feel lightheaded
with 150 to go, and with 85 meters to
the stripe, his legs started to lock up.
"I saw up on the scoreboard that
we had had three up front," said
Brent Mauser. "I started feeling
dizzy, maybe a little dehydrated. I
tried to let the guys know, but there
was nothing they could do."
Ihe Cardinal runners had
planned to cross the line together,
but with Brent's finish in jeopardy,
Brad Mauser and Balkman had to
bolt for the finish.
"Brent was calling' Mold up, hold
up,' but coach was yelling that anoth
er runner was coining," Brad said.
"We had to go l<>r the team points."
Brad Mauser took the race in .30
minutes, 38.57 seconds, and Balk
man was just back at 30:38.02. But
Drake's |ason Lemkhiile scooted
around Brent I lauser, who appeared
to be dragging his legs toward the
stripe, and took third. Brent's legs fi
