### BEN ALLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
DURHAM, N.C. —Junior Sally Clynn and fresh
man Lauren Fleshman came through on the final Clay
of competition at the NCAA Track and Field Champi
onships to score fifth-place finishes in the 3,000- and
1,500-meter runs, respectively.
I lie eight points garnered in those finishes placed
Stanford 30th overall in a field representing over 100
teams. Louisiana State took home the team champi
onship with 58 points. Pacific 1 0 (conference champion
US( 1 was a close runner-up, while UCLA finished I liird.
Clynn and Fleshman highlighted the four-day meet
for the Cardinal, which sent six women to compete.
Both runners came away with personal-best marks.
Fleshman scored first for the Cardinal. Obviously
pumped from watching teammates (Jabe Jennings and
Michael Steinber capture a 1-2 finish in the men's
1,500, Fleshman powered her way to a 4 minute, 17.70
second mark, just three and a half seconds behind
ner Susan I aylor of Brigham Young and two seconds
faster than Fleshman had ever run.
"It's the fastest meet of the year, the best competition
and the team was the most excited that we've been all
year," Fleshman said. "This was the best time to do it."
Clynn's performance came just minutes later. Alter
sitiing back of the leaders for much of the race, Cilynn
charged the last 000 meters to regain ground.
"I was definitely surprised with how the race went,"
(ilynn said. " I thought it would sit a little more and with
1,200 to go, open up a little. There was some shoving
and stuff, and I sat back further than I wanted to."
Hut Clynn recovered well from her early conserva
tive pace. A 33-second final 200 helped her sneak up
and pass runners at the line fora 9:1 7.S 1 finish, a per
sonal record by one second. Colorado stand-out Kara
Wheeler c ame away with the individual title in 9:02.15.
Although the Stanford women did not come in with
a squad large enough to contend for the team title like
the Cardinal's national-champion men's team, the
team got quality performances from fieslnnan athletes
who are likely to score points at the meet in the future.
Freshman Lindsay Hyatt did not advance past the
semifinals of the 800-meter run, but her 2:07.87 in the
preliminaries capped off a successful freshman cam
paign. v\ hicli saw her score at the indoor national meet.
Kathleen Donoghue, the only freshman in the pole
vault field, cleared 12 feet, 3 1/2 inches to finish 17th
overall. Donaghue holds the Stanford record in the
event, having cleared 13-0 1/4 earlier this season.
Fellow 112 reshman Frin Sullivan had a rough go in the
5,000 meters, tumbling to the ground after being inad
vertantly (tipped just 1,000 meters into the race. Al
most going clown again 900 meters later, Sullivan
showed grit just finishing her race, placing 19th in
17:17.84.
Summer l'iei son, the only senior on the team, tossed
the discus 164-10 for an 11 th-place finish.
"Obviously, we didn't have the same team mentality
as the gu \s —it was a little more individual," Clynn
said. "But I think over the next few years we'll get a Jot
more runners being able to score points at the NCAAs."
"We're building a program," added Fleshman, who
will now train to compete in July's Olympic Trials in the
5,000 meters, "l'rettv soon, don't be surprised if we're
up there on the vic tory stand like the men."
