Sandwiched between the excitement
ola Super Regional comeback, over Ne
braska ai Sunken Diamond and a tup to
Omaha for the College World Series,
many of No. 1 Stanford's players laced
another important day in their baseball
lives: the professional baseball amateur
draft.
With five seniors, along with three ju
niors projected to leave school after this
season, in the Stanford starting lineup,
last Monday's draft was a pivotal mo
ment in the careers of several Cardinal
players.
The fast-paced draft, a 50-round af
fair, saw Stanford players light up the
draft boards early, with junior right ban
der Justin Wayne going fifth overall to
the Montreal Expos.
I he Kxpos "are showing high interest
in me, and personally I want to get to the
big leagues as fast as possible," Wayne
said. "This could be the perfect road for
me, and I think we're going to have a
great relationship."
Junior slugger Joe Borchard soon fol
lowed when the Chicago White Sox se
lected him as the twelfth overall pick in
the fust round. Borchard now faces the
decision whether to come back and start
for the Stanford football team or pursue
professional baseball immediately.
"112 couldn't be more pleased with how
things worked out," Borchard said. "I'm
very excited. I like everything I have
seen from the White Sox organi/ation
and was very impressed by their person
nel when I met them before the draft."
Perhaps the biggest surprise of the
early rounds was junior ace Jason Young
â€” he slipped into the second round and
was selected by the Colorado Rockies

with the 47th pick.
Young had heen projected as a sure
fire first round pick, perhaps even of No.
I caliber. However, an early-season in
jur) may have cast doubt on his health
and contributed to his lall in the draft..
After the highly-touted juniors were
off the draft boards, Stanford's seniors
began to follow. With its seventh-rouud
selection, Colorado chose center fielder
Kdtnund Mutli. As both Young and
Muth went to the Rockies, the pair coirld
continue as teammates next year (le
pending on their individual placements
in Colorado's minor league system, as
suming both sign with the club.
Next to go from the Cardinal was se
nior shortstop Eric Bruntlett in the ninth
round to the I louston Astros, then third
baseman John Gall was chosen by the St.
Louis Cardinals in the 11th.
First baseman Craig Thompson was
the last Stanford player selected in tlie
draft, as the San Diego Padres claimed
him with their 23rd-round pick.
All four C Cardinal seniors selected din -
ing the three-day draft improved their
draft placement by returning for their
font th year at Stanford. Muth move< I up
from being a 22nd-round pick last yeor.
Kruntett and Gall climbed from ihes()tli
and final round, and Thompson went
undrafted last season.
While the timing of the draft can eas
ily make it a distraction for players par
ticipating in the College World Series,
head coach Mark Marquess said that for
this particular Stanford team, the fiocus
remains on winning the national title.
"Last year there was disappointment
for some of them," he said, "but this is
what they were expecting a little metre,
and they don't have to worry about it:"
Stanford begins play tonight at 4 p.m.
against Louisiana-Lafayette.
