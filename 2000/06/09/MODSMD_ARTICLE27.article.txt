### NANCY LORD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
for many athletes, participating in a varsity
spoil adds fun, challenge and support from
teammates to their Stanford experience.
For Mary Huang, competing on the
women's cross country team has added a
strength and ability to deal with challenges that
has helped her not only athletically, but also in
her academic pursuits.
Huang is a fourth-year undergraduate major
ing in Human Biology, and a co-terminal stu
dent in Biological sciences. Originally from
Provo, Utah, she feels her athletic pursuits have
enhanced her academic pursuits, and vice
versa.
"1 don't think 1 can ever describe mv 'Stan
ford experience' without the inclusion of run
ning cross country. I remember when I was
struggling with the human biology core. I de
cided to try studying every da\ instead of cram
ming the night before the exams. It's a simple
thing, I knew that the principle of dail\ practice
worked well for running. You can't run your
hardest the night before a big race and expect
to do well.
"I think running also provides a sort of labo
ratory to think about some of the stuff I learn in
biology. When learning about how the bodv ac -
cesses energy in one of mv biolog\ classes, per
se, I immediately try to figure out how that

works when I'm running," said Huang.
(ioing into her fourth year competing for
Stanford, Huang brings experience at both Pa
cific 10 Championships and NCAA champi
onships. She led the Stanford women at the
()ct. 9 Long Beach Invitational.
Running was a way of life for her even before
arriving at Stanford. As a citizen of Taiwan she
holds the national records there for the five
kilometer and 10-kilometer runs. She wants to
compete professionally for them fora year or
two after she graduates.
I fer biggest assets in the cross country world
boil down to two vital things: her attitude and
her love of the sport.
One major challenge for Huang reaffirmed
her love of the sport and changed the way she
felt with the frustrations that are bound to come
along.
"1 think one of the best experiences that
have helped me was when I went through a pe
riod in my life when 1 didn't want to run any
more. I even stopped going to practice fora few
weeks. When challenges arose, I started to
make them reasons for why 1 should let up and
quit. But 1 realized after that, and have af
firmed it since then, that 1 want to be a runner
and that I want to run and run competitively
for at least a few more years down the road,"
she said.
I lie mental strength that pulls a runner
through the tough stretches of a race can also

be applied to other areas of life. I hat strength
has given Huang a new ability to deal with chal
lenges athletic and academic.
"Now, when challenges arise, 1 look at them
as something to defeat. I find myself saying stuff
like 'nothing's going to stop me,' or 'no one is
going to stop me.' I know that 1 want to run and
to iii 11 fast.
"Running is one of those types of sports in
which you are in total control of vour body and
how fast it can go, so essentially. 110 one can stop
me," said Huang.
While many people come back huffing and
pulling from a Campus Drive loop complain
ing bitterly about the pain of running, Huang's
favorite thing both about the sport of cross
country and about running in general is the
feeling she gets while she's doing it.
" The feeling is everywhere - my body feels
exhausted, yet full of energy. M\ mind feels re
freshed, focused and alive. So my favorite thing
about running is the actual feeling itself. I also
love being outdoors, breathing fresh air, and
breathing side by side with my teammates." she
said.
Although she competes because she loves
the sport, Huang also appreciates the friend
ships and bonds she has made with other girls
on the team. Her teammates play an integral
part of her life.

Senior Mary Huang has used her experiences on the cross country course
to help push her in academic endeavors..
"It's so special to have 25 or so
other friends who are all just as
passionate about running as you
are - pursuing similar goals, going
through similar struggles and vic
tories together.
"I don't expect there to he any
thing like this when I graduate.
I'lus, I have also developed some
of my strongest friendship bonds
with my teammates," said Huang.
Although she doesn't see the
team bonds as being something
she will be able to find alter gradu
ation, she plans on continuing to
run competitively for the next few
years, and for enjoyment for the

rest of her life.
"I definitely want to continue
running, that's for sure. I have this
tradition that 1 started with my
high school running mate Tara
Rohatinsky. Every birthday I
have, 1 run my age [in miles].
"I've been doing it since I was
15 or so. When I turn 50,1 plan to
divide my age by two. This is one
tradition I am definitely keeping
when 1 graduate.
"I was also thinking about run
ning some marathons. I think I
have a lot of endurance, and
would love to see how I would do
in marathons," said Huang.
The role she plays on the team
is integrally connected to the
strong connections she feels with
other individuals on the team.
"I think the best wav I can con

tribute to the team is to run as fast
as I can. In the end, we're a team
that wants to run well and win.
"But I think on the day-to-day
basis, 1 think 1 play a positive role
on the team. I don't think I'm the
most social person on the team,
nor do I take the lead or center of
attention. But I don't think I'm a
complete outsider either. I do feel
a connection to the team, but I
think I feel an even stronger one
with individuals on the team -
more so than the idea of the team
itself," Huang said.

20, 1999. The Stanford women's cross
country team went on to capture the
Pac-10 title and finish third at the
NCAA championship meet, where
Huang 112 inished in 120 th place.
