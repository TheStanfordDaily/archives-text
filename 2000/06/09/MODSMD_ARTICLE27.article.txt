for many athletes, participating in a varsity
spoil adds fun, challenge and support from
teammates to their Stanford experience.
For Mary Huang, competing on the
women's cross country team has added a
strength and ability to deal with challenges that
has helped her not only athletically, but also in
her academic pursuits.
Huang is a fourth-year undergraduate major
ing in Human Biology, and a co-terminal stu
dent in Biological sciences. Originally from
Provo, Utah, she feels her athletic pursuits have
enhanced her academic pursuits, and vice
versa.
"1 don't think 1 can ever describe mv 'Stan
ford experience' without the inclusion of run
ning cross country. I remember when I was
struggling with the human biology core. I de
cided to try studying every da\ instead of cram
ming the night before the exams. It's a simple
thing, I knew that the principle of dail\ practice
worked well for running. You can't run your
hardest the night before a big race and expect
to do well.
"I think running also provides a sort of labo
ratory to think about some of the stuff I learn in
biology. When learning about how the bodv ac -
cesses energy in one of mv biolog\ classes, per
se, I immediately try to figure out how that

works when I'm running," said Huang.
(ioing into her fourth year competing for
Stanford, Huang brings experience at both Pa
cific 10 Championships and NCAA champi
onships. She led the Stanford women at the
()ct. 9 Long Beach Invitational.
Running was a way of life for her even before
arriving at Stanford. As a citizen of Taiwan she
holds the national records there for the five
kilometer and 10-kilometer runs. She wants to
compete professionally for them fora year or
two after she graduates.
I fer biggest assets in the cross country world
boil down to two vital things: her attitude and
her love of the sport.
One major challenge for Huang reaffirmed
her love of the sport and changed the way she
felt with the frustrations that are bound to come
along.
"1 think one of the best experiences that
have helped me was when I went through a pe
riod in my life when 1 didn't want to run any
more. I even stopped going to practice fora few
weeks. When challenges arose, I started to
make them reasons for why 1 should let up and
quit. But 1 realized after that, and have af
firmed it since then, that 1 want to be a runner
and that I want to run and run competitively
for at least a few more years down the road,"
she said.
I lie mental strength that pulls a runner
through the tough stretches of a race can also

be applied to other areas of life. I hat strength
has given Huang a new ability to deal with chal
lenges athletic and academic.
"Now, when challenges arise, 1 look at them
as something to defeat. I find myself saying stuff
like 'nothing's going to stop me,' or 'no one is
going to stop me.' I know that 1 want to run and
to iii 11 fast.
"Running is one of those types of sports in
which you are in total control of vour body and
how fast it can go, so essentially. 110 one can stop
me," said Huang.
While many people come back huffing and
pulling from a Campus Drive loop complain
ing bitterly about the pain of running, Huang's
favorite thing both about the sport of cross
country and about running in general is the
feeling she gets while she's doing it.
" The feeling is everywhere - my body feels
exhausted, yet full of energy. M\ mind feels re
freshed, focused and alive. So my favorite thing
about running is the actual feeling itself. I also
love being outdoors, breathing fresh air, and
breathing side by side with my teammates." she
said.
Although she competes because she loves
the sport, Huang also appreciates the friend
ships and bonds she has made with other girls
on the team. Her teammates play an integral
part of her life.
