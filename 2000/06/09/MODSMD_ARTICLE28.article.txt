### LORI MAUND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
One could say that head coach
Steve Swanson and this year's seniors
on the women's soccer team were all in
the same freshman class. (Granted. like
the other seniors in the group. Swan
son will not don a cap and gown this
spring at (graduation.
1 lowever, Swanson and the seniors
(Kelly Adamson, Christ) Arnold,
Catherine Bernard, Ronnie Fair,
Shauna Itri, Natalie Kim, Jennifer
(VSullivanand Wetidi Whitman) have
two very special things in common:
they all came to the Farm the same
year and they intend to leave a strong
legacy of women's soccei behind
them.
This year, the No. Â»S Stanford
women's soccer team lias achieved
more than any othei team since 199.T
This team lias clinched the Pacific 10
Conference title and will advance to
the third round of NCAA this Friclav
night in South Bend, Ind. Ihe last
time the Cardinal made it this far in
the Tournament was when the team
made an appearance in the 1993
NCAA Final Four.
In the years preceding the arrival
of Swanson and the seniors in 1996,
the women's soccer program at Stan
ford achiev ed relative sue c ess, demon
strated in its six consecutive appear
ances in the NCAA tournament since
1990. However, the program ap
peared to lack internal st;ibilit\ and
was on rocky ground. When Swanson
arrived at Stanford, he was the third
coach those seniors had seen in their
four years in a (lardinal uniform.
"People that were around the pro
gram would know that it was a prettv
unstable ship fora variety of reasons."
Swanson said. "1 knew it would be a
challenge and that is one ol the rea
sons 1 came."
After the arrival of Swanson and
this year's graduating c lass, the foc us
of the program shifted. It seemed to
move toward the establishment of a
stable program that would ensure not
just a winning season, but a lasting
legacy of success.
"We wanted to turn it around."

Swanson said. "We wanted to get Stan
ford back where ii should lie, which is
among the top programs in the coun
try. That's always been my goal. 1 said
the verv lirsi day, 'The dream that you
have is that you're sitting in a packed
house. Stanford is iu the final and
you're compet ing fora national cham
pionship.'"
Although this was the long-term
aspiration for the Cardinal, Stanford
was faced with adversity that first
veai . With 10 freshman on the squad,
the Cardinal also was saddled with
eight season-ending injuries. I lie
(Cardinal did make it to the first round
of the NCAA Tournament that year,
but the significant strides for the team
w ere not made on the field.
"Our first goal that first year was to
11 \ to get it positive, to try to have the
team feeling good about what's here
and that it's stable," Swanson said.
"What's happened now is that we've
just grown every year since then.
"To win in any sport in college is
difficult, but 1 think to establish a pro
gram from the inside out is even more
difficult."
Since that first year, the Cardinal
has moved closer toward the dream
Swanson shared with the squad the
first day of preseason.
"Fvery year since I have been here,
it seems we have moved c loser toward
our goal," junior Christy I.a Pierre
said. "There's been a clear progres
sion every year."
1 lie reason foi this marked im
provement in the stabilitv of the pro
gram and a key reason for this year's
success seems to be the leadership of
the seniors as well as the guidance pro
vided bv Swanson.
"The seniors have shown incredi
ble leadership this year," LaPierre
said. "They keep us united toward a
common goal which gives the team as
a whole incredible strength."
Senior Ronnie Fair, the most deco
rated Cardinal player, who has made
appearances with the national team
and is a current member of the
L nder-21 National ream, leads the
team in goals and points.
(.hristy Arnold and Kelly Adamson
have overcome adversity, missing two

seasons due to knee injuries. Arnold
anchors the defensive line with her
agility and speed, and Adanison pro
vides a threat on the forward line,
putting away goals in c lutc h situations.
YVendi Whitman, backup goal
keeper. "has done a fabulous job for us
over four years. She sets the tone in
practice and being a complete team
oriented player," Swanson said.
Casey Bernard, "one of the best
athletes on the squad," according to
Swanson, has improved remarkably
and has been a force off the bench on
the forward line for the (Cardinal.
Natalie Kim consistently started
her freshman year and was a menac -
ing force on the Cardinal's defensive
line. After suffering from compart
ment's syndrome her sophomore
\ear. she came back tomakean impact
on the team her junior year. This year.
Kim's contribution provides depth
and experience on a solid defensive
line.
Jenn O'Sullivan and Shauna Itri
have been consistent for the Cardinal
on the field as defender and midfield
er, respectively. I hey also lead the
team as this year's captains.
"We're so much more of a team
this year," Arnold said. "Steve's got
ten to know the team better. He
knows the things that get us going
and that motivate us. We have more
experience together and it shows."
"I always get emotionallv attached
to my plavei s." Swanson said. "1 tlnnk
you gain so much more w hen you get
involved. I think all the seniors have
gone through some sort of adversity
that helps t hem make decisions for the
benefit of the team."
