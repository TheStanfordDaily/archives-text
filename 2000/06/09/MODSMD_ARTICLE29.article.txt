I .uckih for the Stanford men's soccer team,
opposites attract.
()ne's a vocal leader, the other a <|iiiet role
model, but t(igethei redshiri seniot midfielder
I'.K. Inbodv and seniot defeiidei Cerard
Davis make for not only a d\ natnic duo down
the light side of the soccei field I>ill also a pos
itive influence as captains of this veai 's s(|itad.
"Last year the senior class had a lot of strong
personalities, it was like having font captains,"
junior midfielder Scott Leber said. "After the
graduating ( lass left, we needed people to till
those roles and [Inbody and Davis] have
stepped up brillantlv."
IToiu opposite sides of the globe (Davis out
of 'Auckland, New Zealand, and Inhod\ from
Del Mar, (ialif.) the pair brings not onlv differ
ent backgrounds and experiences to the team
but different personalities as well. And their
team has only good things to sa\ about the
combination.
" I he senior ( lass always has a tremendous
effect on am team. I hey've got to be leaders,"
head coa( h Bobln (ilark said. "(iei ard is quiet
and leads bv example, whereas I K. wears his
emotions on his sleeve. It's a good thing for
am team to have a mix of sin h different emo
tions."
"They're role models foi the younger
guvs," sophomore midfielder Derek Shana
lian said. " I hev're extremely mature and ac
complished playei s. We learn a lot from them.
I he\ know the system well enough to not
make mistakes because the\ have worked
hard to perfect their game and even da\ they
work harder."
I he captains have had the last three vears
to perfect their game together, but before ever
sporting the Cardinal jcrse\ both players
boasted impressive soccei backgrounds.
Davis grew up playing soccei in New
Zealand and joined the I nder-20 National
Squad in 1995 w hei e he met ( lark, then head
coach of the Kiwi National l eaiti. It was Clark
who urged 1 )a\ is to play in America, and w hen
he accepted the coaching position at Stanford
in 1990, he pushed for Davis to leave the I Di
versity of Auckland in favor of Stanford.
"I wanted to go overseas to play, but I also
wanted to go to a university." Davis said. " I lie
I S. was a good option because it's the only

place where you can do both at a high level. 1
didn't know a lot about Stanford, so I went a
lot on what Bobby relayed to me."
1 lalf a world away, Inbody was playing for
lorrey l'ines High School in Del Mar with
Cardinal senior defender And) Hemmerich.
\t lorrey Pines, Inbody led the team to two
California I nterscholastic Federation (CIF)
Div. 11 championship titles and collected such
honors as ( IF Div. 11 Player of the Year (1993)
and Avocado League Player of the Year (1993,
'94). Inbody also played for the Nomads, a
competitive club team that made it to the Na
tional finals in his final year.
When Inbody came to Stanford in 1995, he
could never have imagined that the Cardinal
squad, which finished 5-12-1, would be the
National Finalists only three years later.
"I basically came to Stanford for the
school," Inbody said. "It was a pleasant sur
prise when Bobby Clark came. He totally
changed the mentality of the team. He made
us much more disciplined and focused on
doing well. It has been a much better experi
ence playing fora team with the chance of win
ning the national championship."
Both Inbody and Davis played major roles
in the Cardinal's transformation from a team
that won 18 games combined from 1993-1995,
to a team that posted 18 wins in the 1998 sea
son alone.
"It's because of players like him that the
team and program has grown so much in the
last few years." Davis said of Inbody, the only
plaver left from the 1995 squad. "And it's a
credit to Bobln for having taken the program
and pushed it to a higher level. Now we are
starting to get the benefits."'
As Davis and Inbody watched the team
grow in strength and success, Stanford
watched them grow as players.
Eighty games into his career at Stanford,
Davis has contributed 15 points to the Cardi
nal effort. Most notably, he netted the game
winner this season against California and as
sisted on the overtime game-winners against
Santa Clara this season and against San Jose
State last season in the first round of the NCAA
tournament. As a defender, his contribution
offensively has been one of the most impres
sive features of his game.

For senior soccer players T.K. Inbody and Gerard Davis, having different personal styles has been
one of the duo's greatest assets as team captains.
