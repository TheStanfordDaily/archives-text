"Last year the senior class had a lot of strong

junior midfielder Scott Leber said. "After the

IToiu opposite sides of the globe (Davis out
of 'Auckland, New Zealand, and Inhod\ from
Del Mar, (ialif.) the pair brings not onlv differ

but different personalities as well. And their
team has only good things to sa\ about the
combination.
" I he senior ( lass always has a tremendous

head coa( h Bobln (ilark said. "(iei ard is quiet

emotions on his sleeve. It's a good thing for

I he captains have had the last three vears
to perfect their game together, but before ever
sporting the Cardinal jcrse\ both players
boasted impressive soccei backgrounds.
Davis grew up playing soccei in New
Zealand and joined the I nder-20 National
Squad in 1995 w hei e he met ( lark, then head
coach of the Kiwi National l eaiti. It was Clark
who urged 1 )a\ is to play in America, and w hen
he accepted the coaching position at Stanford
in 1990, he pushed for Davis to leave the I Di
versity of Auckland in favor of Stanford.
"I wanted to go overseas to play, but I also
wanted to go to a university." Davis said. " I lie
I S. was a good option because it's the only

place where you can do both at a high level. 1
didn't know a lot about Stanford, so I went a
lot on what Bobby relayed to me."
1 lalf a world away, Inbody was playing for
lorrey l'ines High School in Del Mar with
Cardinal senior defender And) Hemmerich.
\t lorrey Pines, Inbody led the team to two
California I nterscholastic Federation (CIF)
Div. 11 championship titles and collected such
honors as ( IF Div. 11 Player of the Year (1993)
and Avocado League Player of the Year (1993,
'94). Inbody also played for the Nomads, a
competitive club team that made it to the Na
tional finals in his final year.
When Inbody came to Stanford in 1995, he
could never have imagined that the Cardinal
squad, which finished 5-12-1, would be the
National Finalists only three years later.
"I basically came to Stanford for the
school," Inbody said. "It was a pleasant sur
prise when Bobby Clark came. He totally
changed the mentality of the team. He made
us much more disciplined and focused on
doing well. It has been a much better experi
ence playing fora team with the chance of win
ning the national championship."
Both Inbody and Davis played major roles
in the Cardinal's transformation from a team
that won 18 games combined from 1993-1995,
to a team that posted 18 wins in the 1998 sea
son alone.
"It's because of players like him that the
team and program has grown so much in the
last few years." Davis said of Inbody, the only
plaver left from the 1995 squad. "And it's a
credit to Bobln for having taken the program
and pushed it to a higher level. Now we are
starting to get the benefits."'
As Davis and Inbody watched the team
grow in strength and success, Stanford
watched them grow as players.
Eighty games into his career at Stanford,
Davis has contributed 15 points to the Cardi
nal effort. Most notably, he netted the game
winner this season against California and as
sisted on the overtime game-winners against
Santa Clara this season and against San Jose
State last season in the first round of the NCAA
tournament. As a defender, his contribution
offensively has been one of the most impres
sive features of his game.
"I le's one of Our best attackers, but he's in a

defensive role," Leber said. "He
adds a new element as a defender
who can come up as an attacker on
the wing."
"I le'sa very gifted player with a
good soccer brain," Clark said.
"He makes good decisions with
the ball and has the technical abil
ity to carry them out. He doesn't
realize how good he is. Once he
realizes it, he could become even
better."
A versatile player who has
played both midfield and defense
for the Cardinal, Davis has settled
into right back behind Inbody, the
right outside midfielder, forcing
opponents to think twice before at
tacking the "lethal right side" de
scribed by Leber.
"It's been great to play with him
on the right side," Davis said, "we
have a good understanding of
each other. I le'sa really good play
er, but he doesn't get enough
recognition.
"He's a good leader and has a
high work rate; he's always very in

tense and focused."
Like Davis, Inbody has also
posted 15 points in his career. In
body made an immediate impact
on the team, playing in 14 games
his freshman year. After playing in
two games the following year and
notching his first collegiate goal, a
torn meniscus in each knee forced
him to redshirt.
"As it turns out, the program
has grown so much that playing
this year is much more valuable
than trying to play [in 1996] would
have been," Inbody said.
Indeed, Inbody has been a
valuable asset to the team this sea
son, starting every game and post
ing four points.
"T.K. has tremendous aerobic
capacity, he's a good athlete. lie
has a great ability to play the ball
quickly and he hits great crosses,"
Clark said. "He's the David Beck
ham of our team," he added, re
ferring to the skilled crosses of the
Manchester [England] United's
star outside midfielder.
"T.K.'s an overall leader, he
takes over the games," Leber said.
"He's grown with time on the field
and has gotten consistently better
doing the same things, but with

more confidence."
Now that the regular season'is
over, the captains look with antici
pation toward the upcoming
NCAA tournament, and while
tournament play will mark their
last games for Stanford, it may not
be the end for long.
In December, Davis joins fellow
Cardinal, junior Ryan Nelsen, on
the Under-23 New Zealand Na
tional Team, where the team will
play in the Olympic qualifiers.
Inbody has not totally ruled
out continuing his soccer career,
but will probably be taking the
lessons of dedication, time man
agement and relationship that
he's learned on the field and ap
plying them in an investment
banking career.

has grown so much that playing
this year is much more valuable

who urged 1 )a\ is to play in America, and w hen
he accepted the coaching position at Stanford

1 lalf a world away, Inbody was playing for
lorrey l'ines High School in Del Mar with
Cardinal senior defender And) Hemmerich.
\t lorrey Pines, Inbody led the team to two
California I nterscholastic Federation (CIF)
Div. 11 championship titles and collected such
honors as ( IF Div. 11 Player of the Year (1993)
and Avocado League Player of the Year (1993,
'94). Inbody also played for the Nomads, a
competitive club team that made it to the Na
tional finals in his final year.
When Inbody came to Stanford in 1995, he
could never have imagined that the Cardinal
squad, which finished 5-12-1, would be the
National Finalists only three years later.
"I basically came to Stanford for the
school," Inbody said. "It was a pleasant sur
prise when Bobby Clark came. He totally
changed the mentality of the team. He made
us much more disciplined and focused on
doing well. It has been a much better experi
ence playing fora team with the chance of win
ning the national championship."
Both Inbody and Davis played major roles
in the Cardinal's transformation from a team
that won 18 games combined from 1993-1995,
to a team that posted 18 wins in the 1998 sea
son alone.
"It's because of players like him that the
team and program has grown so much in the
last few years." Davis said of Inbody, the only
plaver left from the 1995 squad. "And it's a
credit to Bobln for having taken the program
and pushed it to a higher level. Now we are
starting to get the benefits."'
As Davis and Inbody watched the team
grow in strength and success, Stanford
watched them grow as players.
Eighty games into his career at Stanford,
Davis has contributed 15 points to the Cardi
nal effort. Most notably, he netted the game
winner this season against California and as
sisted on the overtime game-winners against
Santa Clara this season and against San Jose
State last season in the first round of the NCAA
tournament. As a defender, his contribution
offensively has been one of the most impres
sive features of his game.

"He makes good decisions with
the ball and has the technical abil

realize how good he is. Once he
realizes it, he could become even
better."
A versatile player who has
played both midfield and defense
for the Cardinal, Davis has settled
into right back behind Inbody, the
right outside midfielder, forcing
opponents to think twice before at
tacking the "lethal right side" de
scribed by Leber.
"It's been great to play with him
on the right side," Davis said, "we
