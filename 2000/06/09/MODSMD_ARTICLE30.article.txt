who've been there, ai the scorer's table,

the next dead hall.
(ielbard is a walk-on, the lone non
scholarship plaver on a team ol former
touted ret i nils ant 1 future pro stars. '1 be
Stanford media guide calls liini "a I'un
dainentalh sound player" and"a valu
able reserve on the Cardinal varsity"

game, it's been over fora while.
It's easy lo bag on Cielbard, the guy
who comes in with a minute to go and
starts chucking up shots to the Sixth
Man's delight, But if you do, you miss ii
big pan of what makes amateur basket
ball so great.
(ielbard has held a Stanford walk-on
spot foi three years — and unlike bis
peers, bis tuition isn't paid for. team
mates say he works hard in practicc, and
lie's the first one oil the bench when a
Stanford player scores 01 makes a good
play on defense.
Kvery college team in the countr\
has walk-ons. A lot of them are like Alex
(ielbard: work hard in prat lite, lii si off
the bench, "fundamentally sound." Hut
few of them balance hoops practice
with medical school applications. And
few of them are so contcnt with theii
roles.
"IVac lite- is iiu important pai I ol bas
ketball," (ielbard said. "Most of the fans
don't see it. \l\ job everv tla\ is to make
sure everyone else is on the lop ol their
games in prat tit e.
"I definite!) feel like an integral part
of the team."
Mavbe that's what makes (ielbard so
populiii with most Stanford fans.
I here is, however, a small sectoi ol
(ill is thill docs more I ban root foi (iel
bard. We feel foi him.
It's a group made up of pasi-lile
bent liu,u iners, the guvs in high st liool
who brought the starters water,
cheered a little too loud, waved towels.
We left the court each night with thin,
diagonal red streaks on our legs from
leaning forward in 0111 seats, forearms
pi esscd againsi ihighs.

We lived for prat lice and the ends ol
games, lor those rare moments — usu
ally seconds — when the coach turned
to us and said, "I ley you, gel in there,"
and we peeled off our warm-up shirts
and jogged casually to the scorer's lable,
trying to look like we'd been there he
fore.
Road games were the toughest. I he
rides were long, the crowds hostile, the
games lighter, the chances ol getting in
slimmer. When we did get in (and if you
were like me, it was always when your
team was down), it was a feeling that
made all the hard days of practice and all
the miles on dark country roads in a yel
low hus seem worthwhile.
In his first two years on the Stanford
team, Alex (ielbarcl played in exactly one
toad game: Dec. 17, 1998, at Nevada. He
