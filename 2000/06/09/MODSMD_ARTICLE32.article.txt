## Senior Zach Zimmerer may be a monster on the mat, but his quiet leadership and determination off it may make him Stanford's first fourtime NCAA participant 
### ALEX BENJAMIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I lie Pacific 10 Conference
Championships will likely mark
the end of the year for most of the
Stanford Men's wrestling team.
However, for one member, it will
be the beginning to his ultimate
g<>al of becoming a national (liain
pion.
l ifth-vear senior Zach Zim

merer heads into Ihis weekend's
tournament hoping to qualify for
his font ill-straight NCAA lour
naineni, something no other
Stanford wrestler has done.
Over Zimmerer .s career as a
(bur-year starter, he has accumu
lated a record of 81-41, with onh
23 losses In pin. Alter finishing
fourth his freshman year and sec -
ond the past two years, he cur
rently sits at first in the l'ac-IO and

sixth in the nation heading into
the I'ac-10 (lhanipionships.
I fowever, Zimmerer has not al
ways been at the top ol Ins game.
Asa Stanford freshman, he was in
consistent. As head coach C.hris
llorpcl remembered, one of his
first years, Zacli led the team in
both wins and losses, a rather un
usual mix.
"He could beat an All-Ameri
can one week and lose to someone
below liis skill level the next, I lor
pel added. "However, as he ma
tured, he really learned the men
ial preparation pari of wrestling."
Now Zimmerer, wrestling at
|;W pounds, has finallv harnessed
his potential and become a more
invariable part of the team. So lai
this season, he has fallen lo onl\
one opponent, Fresno Slate's
Paris Ruiz.

This one has been a rather un
usual year for Zimmerer. Normal
ly, he wrestles more than 30
matches. So lar this year, he lias
only wrestled a total of 14
Due to the death of assistant
coach l oci Surmon, the Cardinal
was forced to withdraw from two
competitions earlier in the year.
1 )ue to an ankle sprain, Zimmerer
also had to withdraw from Mid
lands. the only tournament where
(larclinal wrestlers fac e opponents
outside the l'ac-10. He was also
compelled to sit out the All (lal In
vitational because of a pinched
nerve in his neck. But all of this
lias not effected his attitude going
into the Pac-l()s.
"My one loss was good for me
in a way," Zimmerer said. "It has
forced me to work harder, and 1
leel a kc\ to my success will be il 1

can throw the rest of the season
behind me and go in thinking that
this is the one and only tourna
ment of the year.
"When I face my opponents
this weekend, I have to think it is
the first time that I have met them
and clear my mind of what has
transpired in the past," Zimmerer
said.
Despite his success, Ziinmerer's
tenacity on the mat is usually sub
dued to a rather mellow de
meanor off of it.
"He is pretty quiet," said Stan
ford men's wrestling coach Chris
I lorpel, "but he is a terror on the
mat."
As quiet as he may seem, Zim
merer is an emotional leader.
Being a team co-captain for the
second year, he continues to in
spire his teammates.
"Zach is an ii replaceable part
of our team," sophomore Andy
Hunter said. "During the past
three years he has played several
different roles for me: mentor,
friend, motivator, sometimes even
coach. In the practice room he is
quiet, yet exudes a very intense
presence that lifts the room."
His role as captain allows him
to be an integral and essential part
of the team, which is a responsibil
ity that he enjoys and takes a lot of
pride in.
"An important part of being
captain is being able to relate to
the other guys 011 the team," Zim
merer said. "From the best guy on
the team to the worst, I feel that I
can connect with what they are
feeling.
"As a freshman, I remember
dealing with all of the outside in
fluences that some of my team
mates are dealing with now, and
by letting them know that I have
had to deal with these same issues,
they are able to have respect for
me."
His teammates, whether in
coming freshmen or fellow se
niors, all hold Zimmerer with the

highest amount of respect. Al
though he is a key to gaining
points for the Cardinal, the effect
he has on his teannnates is an even
greater part of the team.
"Regrettably, I have not had
the honor of being around him
for more than a few months,"
freshman Brad Selby said. "But
he has impressed me so much
with his lead-by-example intensity
and incredibly solid work ethic.
"He brings so much to the
wrestling room in his words of en
couragement and ability to domi
nate, and he's also a great friend
off the mat. I've enjoyed getting to
know him personally. He's a top
notch wrestler and person."
Senior Rudy Ruiz agreed.
"I think he's taught a lot of guys
by example, the mental and phys
ical toughness it takes to be suc
cessful at the collegiate level," he
said. "When I've been down and
lost confidence, he's made a huge
difference by coming along to en
courage me and to help me re
focus."
Beyond this weekend's Pac-1()
Championships and the likeli
hood of a fourth NCAA appear
ance, Zimmerer will leave Stan
ford with a double major in Me
chanical Engineering and Eco
nomics and head out into the bat
tle of the work place, to take on
any competition the real world
throws at him.
But for now, he's focused 011
this weekend.
" The whole season is a mix be
tween wrestling and school, but
once the Pac-lOs start, it is as if
wrestling is the only thing on my
mind and it is the only thing that
matters."

This piece ran Feb) nan 25, 2000.
Zimmerer went on to qualify for llie
NCAA wrestling championships,
where he was seeded ninth. After a
first-round upset, he [ought back,
winning bis wrestleback match, but
teas eliminated in the second round.
