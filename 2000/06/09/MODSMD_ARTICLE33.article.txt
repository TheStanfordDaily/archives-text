# Palacios ends career on Farm on his terms
## 
### MEGHAN O'CONNOR STAFF WRITER 
On a team dominated by freshmen and
loaded with inexperience is one player who's
seen it all.
I le's experienced the rush of winning a
national championship and the disappoint
ment of not qualifying for playoffs, 112 le's seen
the team come together when it had to and
collapse when it shouldn't have. And he's
lasted through two shoulder surgeries and
five seasons.
But last weekend with the team's exit from
playoffs, fifth-year senior captain Josh Pala
cios said goodbye to Stanford men's volley
ball.
"I thought it was a good way to end my
volleyball experience, with everyone putting
out a great effort," Palacios said of the team's
live-game match with No. 2 Pepperdine in
the first round of the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation playoffs. "I hope the rest of the
guys are lucky enough to have that kind of ef
fort put out for their last match as well."
Though benched most of the season while
recovering from shoulder surgery, Palacios
was a vital contributor to the squad as the
only senior. Quiet by nature and unable to
lead the team on the court, Palacios was chal
lenged with the responsibility of helping
seven freshmen adjust to collegiate volley
ball.
"It was tough for me being out," Palacios
said. "1 felt like 1 didn't have much credibili
ty. That's one of the reasons I rushed back."
On March 3, less than four months after
surgery, Palacios joined Stanford's lineup.
Despite limited range of motion in his right
arm that still prevents him from spiking or
serving, the senior took to the court as libero,
a defensive specialist position introduced to
men's collegiate volleyball this season.
"Kven without full range of motion in his
right arm, he was one of our best defensive
players and passers," said head coach Ruben
Nieves. "It made a lot of sense for him to play
libero. It really showcased the strengths of
Josh's game, which are in the back row. It was
his saving grace; without it he couldn't have
played very much this season."
Palacios competed in Stanford's final 11

matches of the season, including the upset;
victory against No. I Long Beach State on Se
nior Night where he matched his career high
in digs with 17.
Palacios' teammates took note of his tri
umphant return to the court, and his dedica
tion to the program only increased the re
spect they had for their captain.
"I le had a career-threatening injury and
worked really hard to rehab and get back,"
said redshirt freshman Setli Ring. "I le made
a huge contribution when other guys might
have just thrown in the towel."
It would have been easy for Palacios to
take his 1997 National Championship ring
and throw in the towel at the end of last sea
son. The shoulder surgery that kept him out
during his sophomore year hadn't ended his
shoulder problems and he continued to suf
fer from chronic shoulder dislocations
throughout his career.
But last season when the team unexpect
edly lost four of its top players and failed to
make the playoffs for the first time in 10
years, it just didn't seem like the right way to
end.
"I didn't feel complete ending my career
not making the playoffs," Palacios said. "In
order for me to have closure to my volleyball
experience I felt like I had to come back and
guide the program to where it should be."
The downside of his return was it meant
another shoulder surgery, but the upside
was that it also meant a season to play on the
court with his brother Jon, a sophomore who
had redshirted the season before.
"[My brother was] one of the reasons that
I wanted to come play at Stanford," Jon Pala
cios said. "I always watched him play when I
was younger, he's been a great inspiration for
me and it's been a great experience playing
with him."
So this season when both Jon and Josh
starred in the Cardinal's comeback that fea
tured a near-upset against Pepperdine in
five games, Palacios deemed the match a
much better way to mark the end of his Stan
ford career
And looking back Palacios has built quite a
legacy to leave behind. Before he was a

libero, he was an outside hitter and
before that a soccer player. Pala
cios stumbled upon volleyball dur
ing his freshman year at Mira
Costa High School, and with his 6-
5 frame, it soon became apparent
that Palacios had found a hidden
talent.
And when it came down to
Stanford or Princeton for college,
the Princeton coach told Palacios
that if he was looking fora Nation
al Championship team, he should
go to Stanford. So that's just what
he did and two years later that's
just what he got.
He gave up soccer in favor of '•
volleyball and became one of the \
Cardinal's top outside hitters for
the 1996, 1998 and 1999 seasons.
"Immediately he was one of
our best players and one of our
most poised players," Nieves said.
"He learned our system and we
could count on him to be at the -
right place at the right time, fie
was primarily a strong passer and
defensive player."
Off the court, Palacios' contri- **
butions were just as great and this
season when the squad needed a
leader, Palacios was there.
"He brings a lot of experience
to the team," Jon Palacios said.
"He has been an inspiration to us v
all year to want to play hard and ■'
win because of all he's been »*
through."
"He's a very reliable person and '►
team member," Nieves said, "fie y
set a good example for the younger !
players about how to be a responsi- <*
ble Stanford athlete. Asacoach and
team member, you're real proud to
call him one of your own."

This piece ran April 26, 2000. The
Cardinal ended the season with a first
round loss to Pepper dine in the MPSF
Tournament. Palacios had 85 digs in
32 games played his senior campaign.
