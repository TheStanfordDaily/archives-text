# Fabulous Fontaine shines in role as leader
## 
### KATIE FITZPATRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Senior Larissa Fontaine will finish her gymnastics ca
reer in April leaving Stanford as the most accomplished
gymnast in school history. But few on campus know her as
anything other than a normal student.
"Larissa is one of the most modest people I know. She's
an incredible athlete, and nobody knows it." said roommate
and former teammate Ann I hananopavarn.
Fontaine has the unique combination of incredible tal
ent, a fiery competitiveness and a remarkable work ethic.
"It's like coaching Michael Jordan," said assistant coach
Wayne Wright, who coaches the Chicago native.
Fontaine came to Stanford after deferring a year to
train for the Olympics with an established name in the
sport — there is even a skill named after her — and im
pressive credentials: a ten-time I .S. National I earn Mem
ber, a two-time World Championships'l earn Member and
a 199(H)lympic I rials participant.
Vet, she hasn't rested on her laurels at Stanford - she's
been too busy setting records. In 199H, Fontaine, only a
sophomore, became the lirst gymnast in Stanford history
to win a National Championship title. Her vault win was
also the first time in NCAA history that an individual qual
ifier to Nationals has won a title.
Last year, she was sidelined for most of the season with
a severely broken finger that required singer) to repair.
While doctors told her that her season was over, Fontaine
fought back to compete in three events in the postseason
for the Cardinal. After onlv a few weeks of training, she fin
ished third in the vault at Nationals.
Her senior year looks to be the best ever for Fontaine.
She is the healthiest she has been in years and doing the
best gymnastics of her collegiate career.
Earlier this year, she received her first 'perfect 10,' be
coming only the fourth gymnast in school history to score
a 10. In the same meet, she recorded the highest all
around total in the NCAA this year — a 39.82 j — which
shattered the Stanford record.

Fontaine at the helm, it is currently ranked eighth in the
nation — its highest ranking in school histon.
"Larissa's determination to succeed is carrying over to
the team," said assistant coach Rene I .vst (look. "She is the
definite leader of the team, leading both In example and
verbally."
" I wouldn't trade I his year for I lie world. I look forward
to going in the gym everv clay because of who I get to
spend time with," said Fontaine.
Fontaine is currently ranked third nationally in the all
around, fifth on \ault, and tilth on bars.
Making her rankings all the more impressive is the fact
that chronic elbow injuries, inc hiding three surgeries, were
supposed to keep her out of the bar lineup and the all

around this year. (loaches thought that if they kept the in
ternationally-renowned bar worker off the event for the
year, her elbow would be less painful, and she would be
able to contribute more on other events. Larissa, however,
had other ideas.
"I approached the coaches during (Christinas break and
asked to try bars fora week and see how my elbow felt. I
really missed bars - it's my favorite event —and 1 thought
I could help the team," said Fontaine.
Within a few weeks, the senior was able to complete full
bar routines, an amazing feat considering she had not
trained bars for over a year.
"For me, that is the true spirit of sports — to push be
yond your known limits and succeed. I hat's Larissa in a
nutshell," said sophomore teammate Katy I lerbert.
Fontaine's feats also carry her outside of the gym. I he
senior is a Mechanical Kngineering and F.nglish double
major who is planning on co-terming next year in Me
chanical Kngineering.
She is also extensively involved in the elite gymnastics
community, serving as an Athlete Representative for USA
(gymnastics, a role which allows her to use her knowledge
and experience to bring the issues and concerns of athletes
to the national governing body for gymnastics.
"Gymnastics is an intrinsic part of my life — it carries
into everything I do. 1 will have to find a new direction
for my energy after this year, but gymnastics will always
be part of who I am," said Fontaine.
F< intaine had a very different childhood and high school
experience than most students, moving away from home
two different times to train with some of the best coaches in
the nation. However, during her collegiate years she has
been able to experience a more normal life and have
friends outside the gymnastics world.
"Larissa is such a well-rounded person. She's a very
loval friend," said 1 hananopavarn.
"Larissa is the most amazing person I have ever met,"
says close friend and former teammate Amy Murakami.
" filings are coming together really well for her this year -
it's like a fairy tale. I'm happy she's enjoying it so much."
For Fontaine, the fairy tale would be complete if the
team qualifies to "Super Six", the team finals of the NGAA
natioual championships.
"It's something Stanford has never done before. I'd
love to be a part of a team that does it for the first time -
it would be very fulfilling," said Fontaine. "But the pro
grain is building. If we don't do it this year, they'll do it
next year."
I he team will have a difficult job filling Larissa's shoes
next vear. "It will be a big void not having her next year,"
said Lyst (Cook. "We'll probably cry without her."

to going in the gym everv clay because of who I get to
spend time with," said Fontaine.
Fontaine is currently ranked third nationally in the all
around, fifth on \ault, and tilth on bars.
Making her rankings all the more impressive is the fact
that chronic elbow injuries, inc hiding three surgeries, were
supposed to keep her out of the bar lineup and the all

around this year. (loaches thought that if they kept the in
ternationally-renowned bar worker off the event for the
year, her elbow would be less painful, and she would be
able to contribute more on other events. Larissa, however,
had other ideas.
"I approached the coaches during (Christinas break and
asked to try bars fora week and see how my elbow felt. I
really missed bars - it's my favorite event —and 1 thought
I could help the team," said Fontaine.
Within a few weeks, the senior was able to complete full
bar routines, an amazing feat considering she had not
trained bars for over a year.
"For me, that is the true spirit of sports — to push be
yond your known limits and succeed. I hat's Larissa in a
nutshell," said sophomore teammate Katy I lerbert.
Fontaine's feats also carry her outside of the gym. I he
senior is a Mechanical Kngineering and F.nglish double
major who is planning on co-terming next year in Me
chanical Kngineering.
She is also extensively involved in the elite gymnastics
community, serving as an Athlete Representative for USA
(gymnastics, a role which allows her to use her knowledge
and experience to bring the issues and concerns of athletes
to the national governing body for gymnastics.
"Gymnastics is an intrinsic part of my life — it carries
into everything I do. 1 will have to find a new direction
for my energy after this year, but gymnastics will always
be part of who I am," said Fontaine.
F< intaine had a very different childhood and high school
experience than most students, moving away from home
two different times to train with some of the best coaches in
the nation. However, during her collegiate years she has
been able to experience a more normal life and have
friends outside the gymnastics world.
"Larissa is such a well-rounded person. She's a very
loval friend," said 1 hananopavarn.
"Larissa is the most amazing person I have ever met,"
says close friend and former teammate Amy Murakami.
" filings are coming together really well for her this year -
it's like a fairy tale. I'm happy she's enjoying it so much."
For Fontaine, the fairy tale would be complete if the
team qualifies to "Super Six", the team finals of the NGAA
natioual championships.
"It's something Stanford has never done before. I'd
love to be a part of a team that does it for the first time -
it would be very fulfilling," said Fontaine. "But the pro
grain is building. If we don't do it this year, they'll do it
next year."
I he team will have a difficult job filling Larissa's shoes
next vear. "It will be a big void not having her next year,"
said Lyst (Cook. "We'll probably cry without her."
This piece ran February 2<V, 2000. Fontaine xvent on to be naweri
to the Vac-10 All-Conference team in the vault, bars and all
around, as well as the I'm-10 All-Academic first team.
