Some kids dream about becoming professional atli
letes. ()t lit* rs wan I to Ik*doc tors. C «ec >11 Abrams was iih >ic
ambitions than "some kids" — he wanted both.
For Abrams, the 12tIt-ranked collegiate tennis play
ei in the nation, captain of the No. 1 Stan lord men's
team .md a senior hitman biology major, both his
dreams are becoming a reality.
(Mowing lip in Newport Beach, Abrams knew be
wanted to be a professional athlete; the problem was
picking which sport. Whether it was soccer, baseball,
swimming, basketball or tennis, Abrams excelled at
pretty much everything.
but when he entered high school, Abrams made a
choice.
"Baseball and tennis were my favorite. I chose tennis
because of its athletic ism," he said. "I think baseball is a
great sport, and I love watching it, but you sit around a
lot. Also, with baseball, you pretty much stay in the I nit
ecl States, where with tennis, you get to travel the world
and see everything."
When Abrams finally decided to loc us on tennis in
11)92, the titles and achievements rolled in. At 14, he
earned the No. 1 ranking in his age group. Three years
later, he won the US I A National Indoor 18 c hampi
onship.
Establishing liimsell as one ol the best junior tennis
players in the nation and maintaining a 3.92 CPA at
Newport 11 arbor 11 igh, Abrams seemed like a perfect
match for Stanford, Ins dream school since be was nine
years old.
Stepping into a team that had already won back-to
back national championships could have intimidated
the freshman. However, Abrams thrived under the
pressure. During his fii st two seasons, the team won two
more national championships.
Abrams flourished individually as well. Asa sopho
more, he did ncit lose a single dual mate h all year, post
ing,! pet feet 2(i-0 record, the best in Stanford men's ten
nis history.
I lowever, Abrams downplays his undefeated season
because of his position on the team that year.
"I'd like to say going undefeated was a great accom
plishment but I played a little bit of 4, but mainly at f>
and ('), where I had four other guys ahead of me who
were taking care of the l)ig guns," he said.
After winning four consecutive national champi
onships, things were going great for Abrams and his
teammates. The Cardinal was creating a dynasty.
I lowever, at the end of last year, the dynasty suffered
a major blow when the Cardinal lost to Baylor in the
third round of the NCAA tournament.
" The loss against Baylor was devastating," Abrams
said. "We had won the doubles point and were up 1-0.
We figured that we could win at least half of singles. But
when we lost 4-2, it was awful. I never really recovered
from the loss and ended up losing in the first round in
singles and doubles of the individuals. I hat was a rough

week."
After a setback like the loss to Baylor, you would
expect a competitor like Abrams to spend his sum
mer playing in professional tennis tournaments, like
many of his teammates, to get ready for the following
season. However, Abrams decided to focus on his
other goal, getting into medical school.
Therefore, Abrams spent his summer studying for
and taking the M( '.A T and working at a cancer research
fat ilit\ and a county health clinic in Newport Beach.
"I would have loved to play tennis this summer,"
Abrams said. "I didn't really need the time off, but 1
wanted t< > get ready for mv life after tennis."
While Abrams' ability to balance his demanding ten
uis career with the academic rigor of being pre-med at
Stanford has been one of his toughest c hallenges in his
life, it has also gained the respect of many of his team
mates and coaches.
"CeofTis definitely one of the people I admire the
most lor his success on and oil the court," said junior
Alex Kim, Abrams' doubles partner. "He's been able to
be pre-med at Stanford and do really well on the court.
Not many people can do that."
I hough Abrams did not play competitive tennis this
summer, he came back to the Farinas good as ever. This
season, he has been ranked as high as No. 4 in the na
tion iu singles and No. 1 in doubles with Kim. As the
captain and only senior on the team, Abrams has led the
Cardinal toa No. 1 ranking and a perfect 18-0 record.
I lowever, Abrams is still waitingto accomplish his ul
timate goal for the season.
"I'd love to win a singles or doubles championship in
dividually, but the main goal would by far be winning
the team championship," Abrams said. "1 love this team.
I o share a championship with these guys and have it in
iny senior year would be great."
While Abrams will be sad to leave bis teammates and
friends at Stanford, he knows after the NCAA champi
onships in May, life* at Stanford will lie over, and he must
be prepared to lace the real world. After applying to
medical schools this summer, Abrams plans to compete
on the pro tour for at least a year.
"I'll see what happens on the tour and see what hap
pens with getting into medical school, whichever seems
to work out at the time, that's probably what I'll follow,"
Abrams said.
I leac I cc >ac h 1 )ick (Jould believes Abrams will succeed
in whatever path he decides to pursue.
"Ceolfhasa big enough tennis game that if he real
ly dec ides to go somewhere on the pro tour, he can do
a pretty good job after leaving school," Gould said.
" The fact that he is pre-med may detract from his sin
gle-mindedness to become a great tennis player. Geoff
is just a really good person who is going to be a success
whatever he does."
