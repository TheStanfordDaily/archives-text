Zero for six. Having a hitting
day like that will usually get some
one sent to the bench fora little
while, probably get them stuck in
the i < >ac lis cl( >ghouse — especially
il you're a freshman making his
fii st collegiate start.
John Call, however, isn't just
"someone."
Sure enough, the senior third
baseman and leader of the Stan
ford baseball team had a miserable
beginning to his collegiate career,
1 >iit since that day Call has gone
nowhere but up dining his time
with the (lardinal.
Call began the 2000 season as
Stanford's all-time hitting leader
with a .36-1 mark, to go with 192
runs baited in (sth overall) and
277 hits (7th). That's quite a turn
around from going o-ter in your
first college game . . .
Beginnings probably aren't
(lall's sii (>ng point.
" I lie first lime I ever hit a ball
was at <i picnic when I was four or
live years old, playing with my
cousin. 11e said I couldn't play, but
inv next door neighbor said, 'let
liini hit.' So I hit il over the guy's
head and ran the wrong way
around the bases."
Born in nearby I'ortola Valley,
loc atrd prac ticalh next to the Stan
lord campus, Call started playing
I .ittle I -eague when he was nine and
eventually joined the team at near
by Saint Francis High School in

Mountain View. He played mostly
third base, a little bit of second —
and he pitched pretty well too. 1 n
fact, he happened to throw a no-hit
ter in one game, and strike out 15
batters (in a seven-inning game) in
another.
When it came time to pick col
leges, the choice came clown to
Stanford and a familiar enemy for
Cardinal fans — UCLA, 112 lic
choice didn't prove to be that diffi
cult for Call, however.
"Stanford was close to home,
my parents could come and see
every game, I was familiar with the
area . . . plus the overall academic
excellence, and I'd get more play
ing time," said Call, summing up
his reasons for coming to the
Farm.
Sure enough, Call was thrown
into the mix quickly as a freshman,
playing through his hit less begin
ning to become a regular in the
starting lineup.
"He was very mature ... he ap
proached hitting like a junior or a
senior when he was a freshman,"
said baseball head coach Mark Mar
quess of Call, who hit .376 his first
year with eight homers and 59 RBIs
while starting 60 of 65 games.
Over the next two years, Call
would build off of his phenomenal
freshman season. His power num
bers increased to 15 and 12 homers,
respectively, while his KB Is jumped
to (33 and then 70. Beyond the
numbers, though, (iall was becom
ing one of the team's leaders, a play
er Marquess counted on to guide

the freshmen.
"I think he leads by example in
the way that he practices, and the
way that he plays — hard, all the
time. A lot of guys can talk the talk
hut can't walk the walk, but he can
and he does, and he does what he
expects other guys to do on the
team," said Marquess.
Gall's perspective is not like
that of your typical ballplayer, as
over the past two summers he has
played for Team USA in competi
tions against other countries all
over the world. He saw Italy,
Japan, even Nicaragua, and came
away with an altered view of life.
"I went from the Far East to
Central America to Europe, and
it's so different from where 1 grew
up. As far as understanding peo
ple, it opened your mind to new
things," Gall said.
You don't always have to go far
to learn, however, and Ciall's rela
tionship with Marquess appears to
have accomplished that.
"He's more of a factor than I
thought he would be, and he's had
a great influence on my life. What
he does for most players around
here is shape the way we lead our
lives. 1 respect the man greatly,
and he's become a good friend,'
Call said.
As mentioned above, one of
Ciall's main reasons for coming to
the Farm was for the proximity to
his family, who have seen most of
the games during his career. I lis
parents still live in Portola Valley,
and so once a week (lall makes the

trek home for dinner (and per
haps some laundry).
" They're incredibly support
ive, but they also let me live my life
like 1 was away from home." said
the senior.
So what happens when gradua
tion tomes along? (>all was drafted
in the 50th round by (he Cleve
land Indians after last season, but
decided to return to Stanford.
He'll likely be drafted again after
the season is over, and although
he'd like to "play centerfield for
the Yankees," he knows he'll start
at the bottom of the rung. Single A
ball in the minor leagues. If base

ball doesn't happen to work out,
this political science major doesn't
exactly have a backup plan in
place yet.
"To be honest, 1 don't know
what 1 would do without baseball.
Kverything I have is focused to
wards baseball, in that direction,
and il it wasn't, I wouldn't feel like
I'm giving it the greatest chance to
succeed."
Back to the present — Gall's
locus is squarely on getting the
Cardinal back to Omaha for the
second year in a row, this time
winning the College World Series
instead of coming in third as was

the case last year and in Gall's
freshman year.
The Cardinal ran into a tempo
rary setback at Florida State last
weekend, losing two of three, but
Gall doesn't think it will derail the
team in the long run.
"We have a lot of talent, and 1
can't see us not having a great
year," he said.
Not the way you'd expect some
one who started 0-fbr-6 to end up.

Back to the present — Gall's

Cardinal back to Omaha for the
second year in a row, this time
winning the College World Series
instead of coming in third as was

the case last year and in Gall's
freshman year.
The Cardinal ran into a tempo
rary setback at Florida State last
weekend, losing two of three, but
Gall doesn't think it will derail the
team in the long run.
"We have a lot of talent, and 1
can't see us not having a great
year," he said.

one who started 0-fbr-6 to end up.

Zero for six. Having a hitting
day like that will usually get some
one sent to the bench fora little
while, probably get them stuck in
the i < >ac lis cl( >ghouse — especially
il you're a freshman making his
fii st collegiate start.
John Call, however, isn't just
"someone."
Sure enough, the senior third
baseman and leader of the Stan
ford baseball team had a miserable
beginning to his collegiate career,
1 >iit since that day Call has gone
nowhere but up dining his time
with the (lardinal.
Call began the 2000 season as
Stanford's all-time hitting leader
with a .36-1 mark, to go with 192
runs baited in (sth overall) and
277 hits (7th). That's quite a turn
around from going o-ter in your
first college game . . .
Beginnings probably aren't
(lall's sii (>ng point.
" I lie first lime I ever hit a ball
was at <i picnic when I was four or
live years old, playing with my
cousin. 11e said I couldn't play, but
inv next door neighbor said, 'let
liini hit.' So I hit il over the guy's
head and ran the wrong way
around the bases."
Born in nearby I'ortola Valley,
loc atrd prac ticalh next to the Stan
lord campus, Call started playing
I .ittle I -eague when he was nine and
eventually joined the team at near
by Saint Francis High School in

Mountain View. He played mostly
third base, a little bit of second —
and he pitched pretty well too. 1 n
fact, he happened to throw a no-hit
ter in one game, and strike out 15
batters (in a seven-inning game) in
another.
When it came time to pick col
leges, the choice came clown to
Stanford and a familiar enemy for
Cardinal fans — UCLA, 112 lic
choice didn't prove to be that diffi
cult for Call, however.
"Stanford was close to home,
my parents could come and see
every game, I was familiar with the
area . . . plus the overall academic
excellence, and I'd get more play
ing time," said Call, summing up
his reasons for coming to the
Farm.
Sure enough, Call was thrown
into the mix quickly as a freshman,
playing through his hit less begin
ning to become a regular in the
starting lineup.
"He was very mature ... he ap
proached hitting like a junior or a
senior when he was a freshman,"
said baseball head coach Mark Mar
quess of Call, who hit .376 his first
year with eight homers and 59 RBIs
while starting 60 of 65 games.
Over the next two years, Call
would build off of his phenomenal
freshman season. His power num
bers increased to 15 and 12 homers,
respectively, while his KB Is jumped
to (33 and then 70. Beyond the
numbers, though, (iall was becom
ing one of the team's leaders, a play
er Marquess counted on to guide

the freshmen.
"I think he leads by example in
the way that he practices, and the
way that he plays — hard, all the
time. A lot of guys can talk the talk
hut can't walk the walk, but he can
and he does, and he does what he
expects other guys to do on the
team," said Marquess.
Gall's perspective is not like
that of your typical ballplayer, as
over the past two summers he has
played for Team USA in competi
tions against other countries all
over the world. He saw Italy,
Japan, even Nicaragua, and came
away with an altered view of life.
"I went from the Far East to
Central America to Europe, and
it's so different from where 1 grew
up. As far as understanding peo
ple, it opened your mind to new
things," Gall said.
You don't always have to go far
to learn, however, and Ciall's rela
tionship with Marquess appears to
have accomplished that.
"He's more of a factor than I
thought he would be, and he's had
a great influence on my life. What
he does for most players around
here is shape the way we lead our
lives. 1 respect the man greatly,
and he's become a good friend,'
Call said.
As mentioned above, one of
Ciall's main reasons for coming to
the Farm was for the proximity to
his family, who have seen most of
the games during his career. I lis
parents still live in Portola Valley,
and so once a week (lall makes the

trek home for dinner (and per
haps some laundry).
" They're incredibly support
