She doesn't look like your typical Softball catcher,

Meet #37, senior kellie Wiginton.
Wigint< >ii grew up in a Ikuischold with two parents
who loved to play and watt h sports, and the enthusi
asm for athlctk s became contagious.
She c redits a neighbor for introducing her to the
game of softball aftci she got pegged in the lip when
she was six while tossing a baseball around with her
dad in the front yard.
I nfoi innately, the word "softball" is extremely de
< eptive. I here is nothing soft about it.
Wigintou h.is learned ili.it better than anyone at
the most brutal position in the game, victim to an infi
nite number ol knicks and bruises behind the plate.
Nevertheless, as a kid, the young superstar
(ouldu t get enough of the sport and consistently
sia\ed afiei practice to get dirty.
"I loved getting dirty. ()ne oilier girl and 1 would
stav altei practice with our dads and have them throw
us halls as lai to the sides as possible so we could dive
foi them," Wigintou said. "Mv dad was coaching me
at the time, and every day I'd beg him to let me callh
instead ol playing third. I begged for quite a while."
Finallv, 1 )ad caved and Wigintou got her shot.
She never got to play third again.
I he aspiring catcher was one of the founding
members of the town's traveling softball club, the
Fresno Force, when she was nine.
She dedii ated eight years of her i hildhood to trav
eling with her softball teams, leaving every weekend
during the summers to play in countless national
<|iialifici sand tournaments.
I he live-h<>ur road trip down to Southern (Califor

its girls' softball teams, became commonplace lor a
pat k ol l< mi teen girls and their families.
When Kellie was sixteen, club play reached its cul
mination «ind all the grit, hard work and sacrifice
seemed instantl\ worthwhile. That year, the Fresno
Foki' It) X: I nder team claimed the American Soft
ball \ss<)< iatiou national championship after winning
seven games in a double-elimination tournament.
"It was probabh one of the best softball memories
I have." Wigintou said. "I remember that whole last
inning I didn't even want to take a breath. I just kept
telling imself, even with two outs and two strikes on
the last batter, ' I hey could still come back. They could
still tome I»ai k. I couldn't believe it when we finally
won."
A \ ear or so later, at a U( ILA-sponsored softball ex
posure camp, Stanford recruiters took note of the
high st h< >< >1 call her and liked what they saw.
\lt hough Wigintou had her sights on Fresno State,
ha\ ing grow n up watching and idolizing the team, a
twist ol fate — namelv the avid enthusiasm of the Car
dinal < <>a< lies — brought her to the Farm.
As a freshman, Wigintou came into a program that
was floundering. Stanford softball had just made the
transition from club to varsity competition, and Wig
intou began her college career as starting catcher
under the direction of new head coach John Rittman.
From that point on, Wigintou has been the foun
dation of a program that has since taken flight, grow

ing and improving every year to its current position as
the ninth-ranked team in the nation.
Recruiting has improved, anil the school has estab
lished a tradition of excellence in collegiate softball.
Stanford, once a scrappy, second-rate club team, has
evolved into a force to be reckoned with in the presti
gious Pacific 10 Conference.
"Our sophomore and freshman classes are just
phenomenal. They are all such great athletes that the
program is only going to continue getting better,"
Wiginton said. "I think prospective players are be
coming more aware of us, and its motivating them to
work harder in school so they can get in here."
In 1997, Wiginton was named Stanford's Rookie of
the Year and went on to lead the team in her sopho
more year with 193 at-batsas a First-''l earn All-Pac-10
choice.

I'he 1999 season marked the third-straight year
that Wiginton started every single game behind the
plate. Not only did she call the pitches for the first
three perfect games in Stanford history with former
pitcher Many Crouch, but she contributed at the
plate as well, batting a stellar, .35.3. She was named sec
ond-team All American in 1999 and last week shat
tered the Stanford career hits record.
After catching for pitchers who were always older
and with more varsity experience, this year posed a re
freshing challenge for the four-year starter. Stanford
added four new freshman pitchers, each with their
own individual style and set of pitches.
"The freshmen are doing so well this season," cred
ited Wiginton. "They are .til so composed and poised,
considering how intimidating it must be for them to
go up against some of the most talented hitters in the

country.
"It's been a lot different, though, being the older
one this time around and trying to get them to know
and believe how good and capable they really are."
Rittman anxiously praises his go-to catcher to let
her know just how talented she is as well.
"Kellie has caught almost every inning for us over
the course of her college career. That is almost un
heard of at this level of college Softball. And she has die
battle-wounds to prove it."
"Not only is she a phenomenal catcher and one of
the most consistent ballplayers in the game, but she is
a great person and leader off the field as well. She was
here from the beginning, through the growing pains
of this program and has meant so much to its overall
stability and success. I just couldn't ask for abetter per
son or player to coach."
Yet she is as humble and innocently passionate
about the game as that fearless six-year old girl who
once threw the baseball around with her dad on the
front lawn.
She credits all her success to her family, who sacri
ficed so much to trek down to Southern California
every weekend to give her the opportunity to play
against the best.
"I always thought I was going to play at Fresno
State; but, I've never questioned it here," Wiginton
said. "I have had the best time. My friends, team
mates. coaches, even the campus. Sometimes I'm
walking through the Quad, and I am completely over
come with the reality that I'm here, at Stanford. It
leaves me speechless thinking how lucky I am to be
here. I have absolutely no regrets."
Wiginton is not quite sure what lies ahead after this
season, but it probably won't involve competitive soft
ball. Although Wiginton was offered a spot to play in
the women's professional league, the star is ready to
look toward other things that would help constitute a
more normal lile.
I lowever, after more than a decade of breathing
and living the heartbreak, triumph, glory and guts
that make up the game of Softball, it's going to be a
grievous and mournful goodbye.
I here have been too many road-trips, night
games, one-run contests and days of catching in swel
tering heat, to count, probably.
Yet, Wiginton cannot remember a time when she
didn't want to go out on the field and play.
A good catcher cannot be molded overnight. It takes
years of stealthily learning how to frame a pitch, deli
cately gaging if the curve is on that day and, of course,
figuring out how to walk around in that bulky, suc
tioning, spacesuit-like gear.
It's an art form to perfect. And Wiginton has mas
tered the challenge.
She has come full circle. From the little girl who sat,
cheering on the bleachers at the women's collegiate
games to realizing her dream and accomplishing
more in four years than any coach could ask for.
And as she savors the last breaths of her college ca
reer, she might even be lucky enough to return the
favor.
lb turn around after one of the games, wipe the
dust from her eyes after raising the mask and wave at
a little girl in red, poised on the Stanford bleachers,
dreaming wholeheartedly to one day, be in #37's
shoes.

This piece ran April 13,2000. Wiginton ended her career
with 65 starts. Her leadership on the mound inspire the
Cardinal in its best-ever season. The team went 45-1 Sand
played in the NCAA tournament, losing to Michigan in
the Regional championship.

In 1997, Wiginton was named Stanford's Rookie of
the Year and went on to lead the team in her sopho
more year with 193 at-batsas a First-''l earn All-Pac-10
choice.

I'he 1999 season marked the third-straight year
that Wiginton started every single game behind the
plate. Not only did she call the pitches for the first
three perfect games in Stanford history with former
pitcher Many Crouch, but she contributed at the
plate as well, batting a stellar, .35.3. She was named sec
ond-team All American in 1999 and last week shat
tered the Stanford career hits record.
After catching for pitchers who were always older
and with more varsity experience, this year posed a re
freshing challenge for the four-year starter. Stanford
added four new freshman pitchers, each with their
own individual style and set of pitches.
"The freshmen are doing so well this season," cred
ited Wiginton. "They are .til so composed and poised,
considering how intimidating it must be for them to
go up against some of the most talented hitters in the

country.
"It's been a lot different, though, being the older
one this time around and trying to get them to know
and believe how good and capable they really are."
Rittman anxiously praises his go-to catcher to let
her know just how talented she is as well.
"Kellie has caught almost every inning for us over
the course of her college career. That is almost un
heard of at this level of college Softball. And she has die
battle-wounds to prove it."
"Not only is she a phenomenal catcher and one of
the most consistent ballplayers in the game, but she is
a great person and leader off the field as well. She was
here from the beginning, through the growing pains
of this program and has meant so much to its overall
stability and success. I just couldn't ask for abetter per
son or player to coach."
Yet she is as humble and innocently passionate
about the game as that fearless six-year old girl who
once threw the baseball around with her dad on the
front lawn.
She credits all her success to her family, who sacri
ficed so much to trek down to Southern California
every weekend to give her the opportunity to play
against the best.
"I always thought I was going to play at Fresno
State; but, I've never questioned it here," Wiginton
said. "I have had the best time. My friends, team
mates. coaches, even the campus. Sometimes I'm
walking through the Quad, and I am completely over
come with the reality that I'm here, at Stanford. It
leaves me speechless thinking how lucky I am to be
here. I have absolutely no regrets."
Wiginton is not quite sure what lies ahead after this
season, but it probably won't involve competitive soft
ball. Although Wiginton was offered a spot to play in
the women's professional league, the star is ready to
look toward other things that would help constitute a
more normal lile.
I lowever, after more than a decade of breathing
and living the heartbreak, triumph, glory and guts
that make up the game of Softball, it's going to be a
grievous and mournful goodbye.
I here have been too many road-trips, night
games, one-run contests and days of catching in swel
tering heat, to count, probably.
Yet, Wiginton cannot remember a time when she
didn't want to go out on the field and play.
A good catcher cannot be molded overnight. It takes
years of stealthily learning how to frame a pitch, deli
cately gaging if the curve is on that day and, of course,
figuring out how to walk around in that bulky, suc
tioning, spacesuit-like gear.
It's an art form to perfect. And Wiginton has mas
tered the challenge.
She has come full circle. From the little girl who sat,
cheering on the bleachers at the women's collegiate
games to realizing her dream and accomplishing
more in four years than any coach could ask for.
And as she savors the last breaths of her college ca
reer, she might even be lucky enough to return the
favor.
lb turn around after one of the games, wipe the
dust from her eyes after raising the mask and wave at
a little girl in red, poised on the Stanford bleachers,

shoes.

This piece ran April 13,2000. Wiginton ended her career
with 65 starts. Her leadership on the mound inspire the
Cardinal in its best-ever season. The team went 45-1 Sand
played in the NCAA tournament, losing to Michigan in
the Regional championship.

Wigint< >ii grew up in a Ikuischold with two parents

She c redits a neighbor for introducing her to the
game of softball aftci she got pegged in the lip when
she was six while tossing a baseball around with her
dad in the front yard.
I nfoi innately, the word "softball" is extremely de

Wigintou h.is learned ili.it better than anyone at
the most brutal position in the game, victim to an infi

Nevertheless, as a kid, the young superstar
(ouldu t get enough of the sport and consistently
sia\ed afiei practice to get dirty.
"I loved getting dirty. ()ne oilier girl and 1 would
stav altei practice with our dads and have them throw
us halls as lai to the sides as possible so we could dive

at the time, and every day I'd beg him to let me callh
instead ol playing third. I begged for quite a while."
Finallv, 1 )ad caved and Wigintou got her shot.
She never got to play third again.
I he aspiring catcher was one of the founding
members of the town's traveling softball club, the
Fresno Force, when she was nine.
She dedii ated eight years of her i hildhood to trav

during the summers to play in countless national

I he live-h<>ur road trip down to Southern (Califor

When Kellie was sixteen, club play reached its cul
mination «ind all the grit, hard work and sacrifice
seemed instantl\ worthwhile. That year, the Fresno
Foki' It) X: I nder team claimed the American Soft
ball \ss<)< iatiou national championship after winning
seven games in a double-elimination tournament.
"It was probabh one of the best softball memories
I have." Wigintou said. "I remember that whole last
inning I didn't even want to take a breath. I just kept
telling imself, even with two outs and two strikes on
the last batter, ' I hey could still come back. They could
still tome I»ai k. I couldn't believe it when we finally
won."
A \ ear or so later, at a U( ILA-sponsored softball ex
posure camp, Stanford recruiters took note of the
high st h< >< >1 call her and liked what they saw.
\lt hough Wigintou had her sights on Fresno State,
ha\ ing grow n up watching and idolizing the team, a
twist ol fate — namelv the avid enthusiasm of the Car
dinal < <>a< lies — brought her to the Farm.
As a freshman, Wigintou came into a program that
was floundering. Stanford softball had just made the
transition from club to varsity competition, and Wig
intou began her college career as starting catcher
under the direction of new head coach John Rittman.
From that point on, Wigintou has been the foun
dation of a program that has since taken flight, grow

ing and improving every year to its current position as
the ninth-ranked team in the nation.
Recruiting has improved, anil the school has estab
lished a tradition of excellence in collegiate softball.
Stanford, once a scrappy, second-rate club team, has
evolved into a force to be reckoned with in the presti
gious Pacific 10 Conference.
"Our sophomore and freshman classes are just
phenomenal. They are all such great athletes that the
program is only going to continue getting better,"
Wiginton said. "I think prospective players are be
coming more aware of us, and its motivating them to
work harder in school so they can get in here."
In 1997, Wiginton was named Stanford's Rookie of
the Year and went on to lead the team in her sopho
