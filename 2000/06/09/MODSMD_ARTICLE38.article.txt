phone rings, fight the butterflies and a still-healing wrist and

All the while, the pundits are ringing in your ears. Too
short, the mantra goes. A reach in fifth round, the experts
warn. A prat lice player, say personnel gurus.
Sounds like a nightmare.

Since his college career ended in a cast at the Rose Bowl
|,iii. I, Stanford's most productive wide reteiver ever lias

Finalh. time to play ball.

Pasadena, d( k i< 11s operated on Walters'dislocated right wrist.

Ah, but before stepping onto the lield, and even before
cot it racts and training camps and exhibitions, the NFI .scout
ing combine was there, read) to make 01 break the future ca
-1 eersol hundreds of NIL hopefuls.
I lie combine draws alll NFL teams and 1 licit personnel
directors to Indianapolis, Ind., in February lo put potential
prospects through their paces, itu hiding tesis sikh .is bench
press, vertical leap, physical exams, interviews with teams and
the 11< >ly (irail of slat geeks, the 40-yanl dash.
So soon after the season ended came workouts with the
t rat k team, to increase agilit) and speed, because, as Wallers
notes, "everything is geared towards the combine, and run-

iling a good 40-yard dash."
And the combine itself?
"It's a meat market," said
Walters, laughing. "Leg
strength testing, x
rays .... Hie next day you go
to the stadium, and you go for
all these physicals for teams, just
pulling on you and asking all
these questions, like you're a
piece of meat, and they want to
know everything that's wrong
with you."
Finally, on April 15-16, the
big weekend arrived. Prior to
ilif draft, Walters did what any
sell-respecting draft dweeb

would do— hit the 'net looking for info.
"I had lit) idea" where I would get dialled, he said. "I
looked tin the Internet for mock drafts, and I saw anywhere
from fourth to seventh [rounds], you hear all these different
experts saying different things, but you really don't know be
tause all ii comes down to is one team liking you. I wanted to
go within the first four rounds, but I didn't get my expecta
tions up because it's such acrapshoot."
With bis father. Vikings linebackers' coach I rent Walters,
in the team's draft day "war room," I roy sat ai home with his
mother, waiting for the phone to l ing.
I lie call finally did come for Walters tin the draft's second
day, but not quite from the person he was expecting.
"I figured it was my dad calling to tell me who they were
going to pick," Walters said, "but il was [Vikings head coach
Dennis] (Ireen tin the phone, and he saitl I low'tl you like lo
play for us?'. It was exciting .. .il wasa relief lot i: to be over,
not have to worry alxntt where you were going."
Because'l rent has lieen a Minnesota assistant since P.MM.
Stanford's star will be heading back home, and to an organi
zation lie is more than familiar with.
" It's hard to lielieve, because I was a ball lioy for the Vikings
tin senior year in high schtiol. So I was catching passes from
Warren Moon, Brad Johnson . . . pit king up jocks." Walters
said. "During the summer, my main job was
set 11 l ity ... working in the weight room, making suit-no out
got too close to the guys. Now , afier all that, to be one ol the
guys, it's just crazy."
Crazy il may lx\ but Walters will now be lining up tin the

field next i<> established Nil. stars such as Randy Moss and
( ris Carter, whom he saw firsthand at the tninicamp last
weekend.
"It was exciting to go out on the same field as Randy Moss,
(Iris darter, Robert Smith, just lobe in the pros, he said, "But
all that excitement kind of went away, Ixxause it's business."
Being a low-round draft pick, Walters will certainly have to
earn his way into the lineup, especially given the talent the
Vikings have at receiver already. If you ask him. though, he
definitely believes there's a plat e for him on the field.
"I think I provide quickness that they don't have, and I
think they can utilize me in different areas— reverses, isola
tion on a linebacker. I lopefiillv in the return game, I can help
out on kickolland punt returns as well," he said.
I"he pundits don't give him much of'a chance to play. But
then again, the pundits won't be out on the field when train
ing camp opens in August.
I or now, there are classes to finish, a master's degree to
earn, another Vikings minicamp in a month. The draft jour
ney is over; another has begun.
"I haven't made the team yet, and I have to go out there
and prove I belong in this league." Walters said. "It's a new
chapter. I'm used to the cardinal and white, but now I'm
about purple and gold."

This piece was initially ran on May •/, 2000. Walters was re
cently tunned Stanford's Var-10 Conference Medal winner as
the I nh'ersity 's to/> male student-athlete. Along with Mark Mad
sen, he was recognized with the prestigious AI Masters Award.
