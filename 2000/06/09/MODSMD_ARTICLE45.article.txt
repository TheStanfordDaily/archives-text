For Marcy,
You ~
Beautiful face...Beautiful heart,
Dancer of exquisite grace and art,
penetrating mind... yet kind,
Incredible sweetness of soul,
Listening ear,
Most pleasant companion
Assuaging all fear
With tender compassion.
Your heavenly voice carried
On angel's wings
In joyous song, fervent prayer,
Your Father's Face a smile brings
To hear you sing, J
Heart burdens share. A
You ~ are marvelous!
I love you so!
Mom

We are so proud of the person you are and
of your many wonderful talents and accomplishments.
