Catherine —
It doesn't seem possible that four years have
passed since that September day we waved good
bye and left you standing outside Burbank,
3,000 miles from home. You've seen so much
(including far too many airports!) and experi
enced so many things since then — and we've
been able to share the excitement with you,
whether in person or via e-mail. From California
to London to Florence, it's been an adventure
for us too. You've learned so much and grown so
strong, and we're so proud of you. As you
embark on your next adventure, we wish you all
the happiness life can hold. We'll be behind you
every step of the way. We love you always.
