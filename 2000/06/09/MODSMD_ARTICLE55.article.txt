our beloved Nnenna:
With pride and joy we congratulate you
on your graduation. In the words of
Collin McCarly, "Now is a time for you
to celebrate...the accomplishments of
dreams you have worked so hard to
realize...the time to begin to pursue the
next path to reach our for the next
star...Always keep your dreams alive
and keep them coming true.'

As you embark on the next phase of life's journey, we exhort you in the words of Susan Polis Schutz's
beautiful poem titled 'Every Woman Deserves 1 he Best'. "...Choose your goals carefully...Choose a
career that interests you and work hard to make it a success...but also have fun...Be honest with
people and help them if you can, but don't depend on anyone to make life easy or happy for you.
Only you can do that for yourself. Be strong and decisive but remain sensitive...Find happi
ness in everything you d 0... Make a triumph of every aspect of your life."!
As we say in your Nigerian mother tongue, "Nke di niru ga Kanma" (The best is yet to come)
Again, Congratulations!
With Love: Mom, Dad Amaka, Ibe, Jr.
