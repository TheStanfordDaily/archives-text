# Bio-X funnels $7M for labs
## Grant first part of Netscape founder Jim Clark's $150M donation to jump-start the new program in Biomedical Engineering 
### JULIANA LIU STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's program in Biomedical Engineering,
also known .is Bio-X, w ill funnel $7 million in grants
ioi lacullv members to upgrade or construct new
bioreseart li laboratories.
I he grant is the first part of Netscape founder and
forinei Engineering Prof. Jim Clark's $150 million
d<(nation t<i start Bio-X.
I lie project is administered by six committees
made up of 12 la< ult\ and siall from the Schools of
Engineering, Medicine and Humanities and Sci
ences. According to Stanford Newsservice, research
will be devoted to the burgeoning fields of biotech
ucilogv and biomedic inc.
I hope that we will become one of the leading cen

1 lennessN said Stanford has the advantage and the
itupoi taut ingredients - the three schools â€” in close

I Ins is avers grassroots eflbrt involving all the

mittee, said.
In l ebiuarv, the Core Facilities Committee noti
fied fat ult\ ineinbei s asking them to submit propos

()l the two do/en prt>|)osals sent to the committee,
17 were approved in Max. Chemical Engineering
and ( lieiuisti s Assoc. Prof. ( liaitan kliosla and com
mittee c bail told the Newsservice.
Fat ult\ from clepai ttnents such as chemistry, nie

gy i cceised grants averaging $412,000 each.
I he t omittee agreed to liintl projects such as the
I issue Bank, a new tat ilit \ to be developed in the
Pathologs Department. 1 he bank will be a central fa
(iliis ft>i obtaining, storing and experimenting with

human and laboratory animal tissues. Other centers
the grants will fund is the Cognitive Neuroscience Fa
cility, which will allow researchers to analyze brain
function and thought.
"This is phenomenal," said Psychology Assoc. Prof.
John Gabrieli, who is also principal investigator for
the Neuroscience center. "It gives a huge boost for
t lie neurosciences on this campus."
Gabrieli will work with 10 researchers from the
School of Medicine to establish the Neuroscience cen
ter.
"Rather than being divided by parochial interest,
people can come together for the shared interest of
the University," Dean of Research Charles Kruger
said.
"Students are the life-blood of this project," Chem
ical Engineering Prof. Channing Robertson said.
He said the Education Committee will establish
new interdisciplinary courses.
The committee also hopes to continue month-long
seminars started last fall to attract researchers and
students, Education Committee chair Sharon Long
said.
An April seminar was called "Smelling with Hairy
Little Noses and Feeding with Hairy Little Legs."
Faculty, such as Spudich, have said the Bio-X pro
gram could be a drawing card for leading researchers
and professors from other universities.
1 lie idea for the program began two years ago
when Nobel winner and Physics Prof. Steven Chu,
Robertson, Spudich and others decided to promote
interdischiplinary research and teaching in bio
science, bioengineering and biomedicine, according
to Stanford News Service.
"We called it Bio-X because we never came up with
a name that was short enough to describe the global
nature of what we want to do here," Spudich said.
"It's really a philosophy, not a specific program."
Clark's October donation of $150 million, the
largest grant ever since the University's founding
grant, was matched by an anonymous donor who
gave an additional $00 million.
I he University has earmarked $120 million of the
total $210 million to build the James H. Clark Center
for Biomedical Engineering and Services, according
to the News Service.
Construction for the center will begin this sum
mer.
"I am extremely excited about it," Hennessy said.
"It builds on Stanford's strengths, and it is very for
ward looking."
