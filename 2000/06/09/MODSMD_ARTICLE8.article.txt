# Graduate housing draw leaves 985 students unassigned

### RITU BHATNAGAR EDITORIAL STAFF 
This spring's graduate student housing draw left
985 graduate students unassigned, out of the total of
4,846 who applied. The Provost's Office lias agreed
to provide funds that would subsidize 275 addition
al, off-campus units, which Director of Housing and
Dining Services Keith Guy said would help consider
ably in the housing crunch.
The new on-campus studio apartments added
508 spaces to this year's draw, which is why this
spring's unassigned number is less than the over
1,000 students without housing last year.
Guy said that his office is currently pursuing ways
to address the "unmet demands" of those graduate
students left without housing. Out of the 4.846 ap
plicants, 219 students will remain in their current
housing, and 3,642 students received housing as
signments. In total 508 students will be on-campus
next year, and 707 will be in off-campus subsidized
housing.
In order to determine what Guy c alls the "unmet
demand," he said that from the 985 students, the
Housing Office subtracted the 100 students who re
quested specific housing placements on their appli
cations.
"We then get the demand as 879 students â€” those
willing to live anywhere," Guy said.
Mary-Lee Kimber, a doctoral student in political
science, is unassigned for next year.
"I didn't select the 'accept any housing' option,
but a lot of people aren't aware of what that can do,"
Kimber said. "If you select that [and are unassigned],
you're not eligible for off-campus subsidized hous
ing."
Kimber said that information concerning the
housing draw is not made available to students and
that the process during and afterwards is confusing
for many students.
"After I found out [about the draw], I was try
ing to figure out my options and was getting dif
ferent information from different people. Gradu
ate students are not aware of the process; each

year ii changes, and there's not a lot of informa
tion available."
There are 213 off-campus housing units which
will become available at different points this summer,
which Guy said the Housing Office would then as
sign once they were vacated.
After taking into account the 275 spaces that the
Provost's Office will subsidize, Guy estimates the true
"unmet demand" of students as 355.
Physics graduate student Kaleb Michaud, who
was the former chair of the Graduate Student Coun
cil, said, "Three hundred and some is still a big num
ber to find housing for. I know some people would
like to see more housing subsidized."
Michaud did say he was "encouraged" by the 275
new spots. "I know people who were looking for
housing bill after the announcement felt more re
lieved."
Kimber said that at the first meeting between the
Graduate Student Housing Advisory Council and
Housing Services following the draw, students raised
their concerns about the housing situation. She said
that when Housing Services returned with news ol
275 more spots, students were pleased, but are cur
rently wondering if the University will be able to find
that many apartments.
Although the Housing Office has just found 70
apartments in a recently renovated building, Guy
said that it would be a "big challenge" to find the re
maining apartments.
"We try to enter into lease agreements for blocks
of apartments," he said. "We may end up having to
pick up apartments two or three at a time, which
means a lot more properties, more agreements, dif
ferent ways in which students are being billed."
While the Housing Office has traditionally ob
tained apartments in Mountain View, Guy said that
his office is currently exploring options available
north, in Redwood City, where prices are also a bit
cheaper.
I ft lie General Use Permit isapproved this coming
year, Guy said that would clear the path to begin
plans to build another 500 units on campus, that
could be prepared as early as June 2001.
