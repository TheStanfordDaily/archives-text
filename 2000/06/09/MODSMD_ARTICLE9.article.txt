Nurses go on strike at
Stanford's two hospitals
Over 1,700 nurses went on strike at Stanford's two hospitals
Wednesday after union negotiators rejected a last-minute manage
ment wage offer that fell short of union demands and then subse
quently broke off bargaining talks.
No new negotiations have been scheduled, and the bargaining
teams have not indicated that they will resume talks in the near future.
Both sides indicated, however, that they wanted a quick end to the di
pute.
It was the first strike by Stanford nurses in over 25 years.
The two hospitals brought in 500 temporary nurses from across the
nation to replace strikers and asked doctors to fill in when needed. Pa
tients did not appear to think that they received inadequate treatment
and attention.
Nurses walked in picket lines with signs saying things like "Exhaust
ed Nurses Need Intensive Care Too" outside of Stanford Hospital and
Lucile Packard Children's Hospital after the 7 a.m. strike deadline
passed without a new contract.
The nurses are asking fora two-year contract with a wage increase
of 11.5 percent in the first year and 9.5 percent the second year, along
with improved health-care benefits and the elimination of mandatory
overtime, which the nurses say leaves them overworked and endangers
patient care.
Under the contract which expired May 31, nurses' wages ranged
from $25.52 an hour to $37.43 an hour, with an average hourly pay of
$33.
