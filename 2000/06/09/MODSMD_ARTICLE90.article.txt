# Congratulations, Laurel Lucia Whitnah
## 
### 
It doesn't seem so long
ago, your journey began as
our loving daughter and
sweet sister to Tommy.
From the very start, you
have lit up our lives and
made so many dreams
come true. We've treasured
every precious moment.
Now, as you graduate and
your new journey begins in
the "real world/' we wish
you a lifetime of continued
happiness and success.
We're all so proud of you!
