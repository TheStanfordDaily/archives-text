Congratulations to Aron Ketchel!
When you were a toddler we dared to dream that
you would one day attend our alma mater,
Stanford. Our hearts fill with pride as you gradu
ate with the class of 2000. We know that as you
look hack upon these four years you will find
warmth in the friendships, joy in the memories,
and inspiration from challenges met. We wish you
lifelong success and happiness, always enriched
by our love.
