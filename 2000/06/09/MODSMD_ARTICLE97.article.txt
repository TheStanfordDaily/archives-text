You have grown from
our dainty dancer to an
amazing, accomplished
young woman.
Your persistence, hard
work, and dedication has
prevailed again.
We are so proud of
all that you do.

Always keep in mind, "If you can imagine it, you can achieve
it, If you can dream it, you can become it."
...and we know you will!
Congratulations!
love, Mom, Dad, Shane, trin, and Garrett
