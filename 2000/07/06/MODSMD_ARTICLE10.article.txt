nurses at Stanford Hospital and
Clinics and Lucile Packard Chil

asking for a 16.5 percent pay in
crease over two years. The hospi

years. The nurses union has vol

creases in their past two contracts
because the Stanford Medical
Center has suffered from finan
cial problems. According to Grif
fin, the Consumer Price Index,
which measures the cost of living,
rose 4.2 percent, while pay in
creases have only been 3 percent.
"It would be irresponsible for
the hospital to meet CRONA's
current salary demands, which
would damage the long-term via
