# Packard nurses continue strike
## 
### ROBERT CHAN 
Over 1,700 nurses from Stan
ford Hospital and the Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital are
still on strike as their demand for
better pay and staffing conditions
continues to go unmet.
Negotiations resumed be
tween representatives of Stan
lord hospitals and the striking
nurses union on Monday. Repre
sentatives from The Federal Me
diator called CRONA (Commit
tee for the Recognition of Nurs
ing Achievement) and Stanford
hospital officials returned to the
bargaining table following a 10
day stop in talks. CRONA repre
sents more than 1,700 registered
nurses at Stanford Hospital and
Clinics and Lucile Packard Chil
dren's Hospital. Prior talks broke

down between the two sides after
failing to reach a pay agreement.
Kim Griffin, the spokeswoman
for CRONA, said the nurses are
asking for a 16.5 percent pay in
crease over two years. The hospi
tal is offering 8 percent over two
years. The nurses union has vol
untarily taken very low pay in
creases in their past two contracts
because the Stanford Medical
Center has suffered from finan
cial problems. According to Grif
fin, the Consumer Price Index,
which measures the cost of living,
rose 4.2 percent, while pay in
creases have only been 3 percent.
"It would be irresponsible for
the hospital to meet CRONA's
current salary demands, which
would damage the long-term via

bility of the hospitals and inhibit
oui ability to operate many of the
advanced programs and specialty
services that this community has
come to depend on," said
Christopher Dawes, CEO of Lu
cile Packard Children's Hospital.
Stanford and Packard have
proposed to increase the average
full-time nurses' salary to $75,700
by the second year of the contract
with an entry-level salary of
$57,400 and a top salary of
$84,200. All of this is before bene
fits, higher pay rates for evening
and weekend shifts or overtime.

"Both sides are still talking at
this time," said Ben Drew, a
spokesman for Stanford Medical
Center.
Meanwhile, in downtown
Menlo Park, striking Stanford
nurses marched through the
streets to publicize their de
mands. Other efforts include
striking nurses picketing Stan
ford Hospital. Their signs read
"Stanford-Packard Nurses on
Strike" and "1 want to be a nurse,
can I afford to?"
Stanford hospitals has brought
in 500 replacement nurses from
around the country at an expense
of $4,000 to $5,000 a week. In ad
dition, these strikebreakers are
provided with housing at hotels
and Stanford dormitories. The
average CRONA nurse is paid
$ 1,070 a week, $55,540 a year.

"Despite the challenges of the
strike, our exceptional team of
physicians, qualified nurses and
staff have continued to provide
high quality care to our patients,"
said Melinda Mitchell, CEO of
Stanford Hospital.
Meredith Haws, a registered
nurse picketing outside Stanford
Hospital's loading dock and wav
ing peace signs at the passing-by
Marguerite shuttles, noted the
shortage of nurses.
"I work in the home-care divi
sion and because of a shortage of
nurses, new intakes into the divi
sion were actually being turned
away," said Haws. "Stanford hos
pital doesn't attract new nurses
because of the pay and the cost of
living in the area."
According to Griffin, the Stan
ford Medical Center posted 120

positions for more nurses before
the strike began. Because of the
nursing staff shortage, the work
load of the nurses has increased,
which "jeopardizes patient safe
ty," said Griffin.
Haws explained that many of
the striking nurses have had no
trouble finding temporary jobs
through nursing registries dur
ing the strike. Several nurses have
expressed concern that nurses
may not return after the strike be
cause of better pay at other hospi
tals. This would worsen the
staffing problem.
Griffin says the nurses are also
concerned with issues of health
care coverage, mandatory over
time, parking lot safety and a two
tier ATO-PTO system of sick and
vacation days. The care provider
list has decreased. Prescriptions

are harder to get while the price
for them has increased.
Patients have also been un
pleased with the way the hospital
has functioned since the strike.
"1 would like the restoration of
professionalism as in the past. My
experience since the strike has
been that I have not received the
usual tender care. It could be im
proved by having experienced,
caring nurses back in the hospi
tal," said Joe Armstead, a recent
patient at Stanford Hospital.
"We are looking forward to get
ting the nurses back, settling the
strike in a fair and positive manner
and having the nurses back once
again to be part of our great pa
tient-care team," said Drew.
Although both parties remain
available to meet, no new meet
ings have been scheduled.
