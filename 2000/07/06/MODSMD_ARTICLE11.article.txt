## 
### DENNIS TYLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
The school year has not yet
begun, but seniors Seth Newton
and Malia Villegas, the new ASSU
president and vice president, are al
ready working hard on the goals
they set out in their presidential
campaign: increasing student voice.
This summer they attended the
Ivy Plus Conference in Rhode Is
land to discuss how to get more stu
dents involved in campus issues. Ivy
Plus is hosted by Princeton Univer
sity and invites nine elite universi
ties to the conference to talk about
community based service learning.
Among the schools present were
Brown, the University of Pennsyl
vania, Harvard, Yale, Cornell, Co
lumbia, the University of Chicago,
MIT and Stanford.
"It was a conference on bow to
get students and faculty together to
focus on service learning," said
Newton.
"Stanford is in the lead in that
area, whereas other Ivies are not
key on promoting service learning.
Some of them [the Ivies] are behind
in encouraging student voice and
engagement," said Villegas.
Although Villegas admits that
Stanford does give consideration to
student involvement, she recog
nizes that there are other areas
where the University can improve.
"At Cornell, for example, stu
dents have a very influential role on

die Board of Trustees, whereas stu
dent involvement on the Board of
Trustees at Stanford is less visible,"
said Villegas.
At the conference, the students
and administrators from these uni
versities developed ways of solving
some of the problems with commu
nity-based service learning.
"We produced a report stilting
that we saw it absolutely necessary
to be involved at all levels of the uni
versity," said Newton.
To ensure that this happens,
another conference is being
planned in the spring for students
to gather and discuss service learn
ing and student issues.
As far as achieving their goals
for students on campus, Newton
and Villegas said they were not
concerned about the changing of
the guard that is occurring with
administration.
"We have already met with
Stein, Hennessy and the communi
ty center directors. And we will be
meeting with all of the top adminis
trators to ask about their big agenda
ideas," said Newton.
Newton and Villegas are taking
the preliminary steps to maintain
communication with the top ad
ministrators and are developing
programs that will raise awareness
about student issues.
"We are creating a proposal con
cerning student engagement,
which will be presented to the
provost, president and the Board of

Trustees," said Newton.
"Additionally, we are in the
process of developing a speaker se
ries on race to examine the current
race relations on campus. We may
have dialogues that include key fac
ulty members. We are working with
Jim Sure, lecturer in the Sch<x>l of
Education, about funding and con
tacts," said Villegas.
Some long-range goals that they
have are to get more support from
the University for academic and in
terdisciplinary programs, such as
Comparative Studies in Race and

Ethnicity (CSRE). They also would
like to have more student-initiated
courses and are creating a co-spon
sorship with the I laas Center to im
plement such courses.
The ASSU president and vice
president will he busy this summer
working on things for the upcom
ing school year. They are confident
they will achieve everything they set
out to do.
"Seth and I provide different
perspectives in and outside of the
ASSU and our combination is very
effective," said Villegas.
