# Casper and graduates say goodbye

### KIMBERLY DOWNS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Jubilant seniors dashed straight onto the field
while the bearers of the school flags formally walked
along the track to reach the stage set up for the
109 th Commencement ceremonies.
Costumes ranged from Superman to Pacman
during the traditional "wacky walk." (lames of fris-
Ixr abounded, and students could be seen playing
football and croquet as well. Some graduates car
ried signs — many thanking parents, one reading
"Wanted: SF Apartment" and others appealing to
Secretary General of the United Nations Kofi
Annan to lift the sanctions on Iraq. On a similar
note, a helicopter flew over the stadium trailing a
banner behind it saying, "UN/US End Sanctions on
Iraq now!"
Throughout the half-hour before the formal
ceremonies began, students could be seen talking
on cell phones to family and friends in the bleach
ers. Those in the stands without phones searched
for their graduates with binoculars.
All quieted down when faculty and key adminis
trators entered the stadium to take the stage. Se

niors joined graduate students in sitting down and
then quickly standing up again to give outgoing
University President Gerhard Gasper one of many
standing ovations that morning. Casper threatened
to chant each of the 4, 815 graduates' names if they
did not stop chanting his name.
('.asper started the ceremonies by giving a series
of statistics about this year's graduating class.
Casper conferred 1,799 bachelor's degrees, 2,094
master's degrees and 922 doctoral degrees. Of the
graduating students, 314 graduated with depart
mental honors, 200 with University distinction, 162
with more than one major, 79 with dual bachelor's
degrees and 318 with co-terminal master's and
bachelor's degrees.
()n a more personal note, Casper invoked one of
his favorite sayings, that at a university "all days are
first days" but then went on to say that, "And yet
today — there is no getting around this — it is a last
day for many of us — myself included. Today we
share the joy and sadness of last days."
The theme of this last day, heard from both
Casper and Annan, would be the role that the new


Agence France Presse
Annan called upon graduates to protect the environment
graduates played in the world.
Casper invoked this sentiment first by
reminding the graduates of the
world events that occurred during
their years at Stanford and then by
telling them what the demographics
of the global village would look like if
the Earth's population was shrunk
down to 100. The most important
fact for the graduates was that only
one of the 100 would have a college
education.
"As that one in 100 with a college
education, much will l)e asked and
expected of you in addressing the
problems of the world you now

enter," Casper said.
Provost Hennessy then presented
the Walter ). (iores Faculty Achieve
ment Award, the Lloyd W. Dinkel
spiel Awards and the Kenneth M.
Cuthbertson Award to both faculty
members and students.
The podium was then turned
over to Annan, but before he had the
opportunity to begin speaking,
about 60 people sitting at the far-left
end of the stadium crowd com
menced protesting loudly about the
sanctions against Iraq and Ethiopia's
ongoing invasion of disputed terri
tory along its border with Eritrea. In
response, Annan said, "1 have lis
tened to you. May 1 have my turn?
Thank you."
Having silenced the protestors,
Annan turned to the graduates, say
ing, "I can tell that the Stanford
'Farm' has produced yet another

bumper crop." He proceeded to
make a special plea to this bumper
crop and the rest of their genera
tion, and that was lor them to lead
the way in safeguarding the global
environment.
Drawing from a report entitled
"We the Peoples," which he wrote to
inform people about the challenges
everyone faces at the dawn of the new
millennium after he had analyzed the
state of humankind, Annan in
formed the graduates and all in at
tendance that, in environmental
terms "the inescapable global reality
is that we are plundering our chil
dren's future."
He encouraged the graduates to
choose a life of activism and engage
ment in public affairs and said, "Your
generation must improve upon my
generation's record. It will be up to
you, ultimately, to build, and to live

by, the new ethic of global steward
ship that is so badly needed."
To end, Annan quoted American
poet Robert Frost, who once wrote
that "education is hanging around
until you've caught on."
"My friends," Annan said, "1 have
no doubt that you have caught on —
to the nature of life in the global vil
lage and to your own natures as well."
He t hen encouraged the graduates to
go out into the world and apply what
they learned at Stanford to global
problems.
Casper then attempted to confer
degrees on all of the graduates, but
was initially prohibited from doing so
by the protestors, who had started
their chanting again once Annan fin
ished his address. They quieted
down when Casper said, "It would be
nice if the demonstrators would allow
the graduates to graduate." Casper

then repeated the same formula
eight times (once for the undergrad
uates and then once for each of the
seven graduate schools), which
prompted many studenLs halfway
through to pin him as he admitted
candidates to the "rights, responsibil
ities and privileges" of their degrees.
"That's very good," (las per jok
ingly said. "It shows you can still
learn."
Before ending the ceremony,
Casper took the opportunity to thank
Stanford alumnus Herbert Hoover,
who twice (after World War I and
World War II) on behalf of the Unit
ed States helped alleviate the scars of
war and hunger. Casper hoped that
die graduates, like I loover, would re
member that Stanford, among other
things, stands for generosity and for
understanding the importance of
higher education and its support.

Casper and Annan, would be the role that the new


Agence France Presse
Annan called upon graduates to protect the environment
graduates played in the world.
Casper invoked this sentiment first by
reminding the graduates of the
world events that occurred during
their years at Stanford and then by
telling them what the demographics
of the global village would look like if
the Earth's population was shrunk
down to 100. The most important
fact for the graduates was that only
one of the 100 would have a college
education.
"As that one in 100 with a college
education, much will l)e asked and
expected of you in addressing the
problems of the world you now

enter," Casper said.
Provost Hennessy then presented
the Walter ). (iores Faculty Achieve
ment Award, the Lloyd W. Dinkel
spiel Awards and the Kenneth M.
Cuthbertson Award to both faculty
members and students.
The podium was then turned
over to Annan, but before he had the
opportunity to begin speaking,
about 60 people sitting at the far-left
end of the stadium crowd com
menced protesting loudly about the
sanctions against Iraq and Ethiopia's
ongoing invasion of disputed terri
tory along its border with Eritrea. In
response, Annan said, "1 have lis
tened to you. May 1 have my turn?
Thank you."
Having silenced the protestors,
Annan turned to the graduates, say
ing, "I can tell that the Stanford
'Farm' has produced yet another

bumper crop." He proceeded to
make a special plea to this bumper
crop and the rest of their genera
tion, and that was lor them to lead
the way in safeguarding the global
environment.
Drawing from a report entitled
"We the Peoples," which he wrote to
inform people about the challenges
everyone faces at the dawn of the new
millennium after he had analyzed the
state of humankind, Annan in
formed the graduates and all in at
tendance that, in environmental
terms "the inescapable global reality
is that we are plundering our chil
dren's future."
He encouraged the graduates to
choose a life of activism and engage
ment in public affairs and said, "Your
generation must improve upon my
generation's record. It will be up to
you, ultimately, to build, and to live

by, the new ethic of global steward
ship that is so badly needed."
To end, Annan quoted American
poet Robert Frost, who once wrote
that "education is hanging around
until you've caught on."
"My friends," Annan said, "1 have
no doubt that you have caught on —
to the nature of life in the global vil
lage and to your own natures as well."
He t hen encouraged the graduates to
go out into the world and apply what
they learned at Stanford to global
problems.
Casper then attempted to confer
degrees on all of the graduates, but
was initially prohibited from doing so
by the protestors, who had started
their chanting again once Annan fin
ished his address. They quieted
down when Casper said, "It would be
nice if the demonstrators would allow
the graduates to graduate." Casper

then repeated the same formula
eight times (once for the undergrad
uates and then once for each of the
seven graduate schools), which
prompted many studenLs halfway
through to pin him as he admitted
candidates to the "rights, responsibil
ities and privileges" of their degrees.
"That's very good," (las per jok
ingly said. "It shows you can still
learn."
Before ending the ceremony,
Casper took the opportunity to thank
Stanford alumnus Herbert Hoover,
who twice (after World War I and
World War II) on behalf of the Unit
ed States helped alleviate the scars of
war and hunger. Casper hoped that
die graduates, like I loover, would re
member that Stanford, among other
things, stands for generosity and for
understanding the importance of
higher education and its support.
