# Casper and graduates say goodbye

### KIMBERLY DOWNS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Jubilant seniors dashed straight onto the field
while the bearers of the school flags formally walked
along the track to reach the stage set up for the
109 th Commencement ceremonies.
Costumes ranged from Superman to Pacman
during the traditional "wacky walk." (lames of fris-
Ixr abounded, and students could be seen playing
football and croquet as well. Some graduates car
ried signs — many thanking parents, one reading
"Wanted: SF Apartment" and others appealing to
Secretary General of the United Nations Kofi
Annan to lift the sanctions on Iraq. On a similar
note, a helicopter flew over the stadium trailing a
banner behind it saying, "UN/US End Sanctions on
Iraq now!"
Throughout the half-hour before the formal
ceremonies began, students could be seen talking
on cell phones to family and friends in the bleach
ers. Those in the stands without phones searched
for their graduates with binoculars.
All quieted down when faculty and key adminis
trators entered the stadium to take the stage. Se

niors joined graduate students in sitting down and
then quickly standing up again to give outgoing
University President Gerhard Gasper one of many
standing ovations that morning. Casper threatened
to chant each of the 4, 815 graduates' names if they
did not stop chanting his name.
('.asper started the ceremonies by giving a series
of statistics about this year's graduating class.
Casper conferred 1,799 bachelor's degrees, 2,094
master's degrees and 922 doctoral degrees. Of the
graduating students, 314 graduated with depart
mental honors, 200 with University distinction, 162
with more than one major, 79 with dual bachelor's
degrees and 318 with co-terminal master's and
bachelor's degrees.
()n a more personal note, Casper invoked one of
his favorite sayings, that at a university "all days are
first days" but then went on to say that, "And yet
today — there is no getting around this — it is a last
day for many of us — myself included. Today we
share the joy and sadness of last days."
The theme of this last day, heard from both
Casper and Annan, would be the role that the new
