## EDITOR'S NOTEBOOK Welcome to our first summer issue 
### 
No one ever means for it to hap
pen. You walk through the glass
doors into The Daily office one
day at the beginning of the year,
hoping that the editors of the section you
want to write for will assign you a story.
They always do, but typically it's not any
thing that would run anywhere near the
front page.
So you return, hoping that if you write
more and write it well you'll make the front
page. You do, and then it seems that the dif
ferent section editors are calling you every
night to write. Most of the time you accept,
because who wants to remain a contribut
ing writer when after only 24 articles you
could be a staff writer?
Writing stories is no longer satisfying.

Now you want to be an editor of some sort
because whenever you walk into the news
room everyone seems so close knit, and you
want to understand the inside jokes that are
tossed around and partake in the incessant
banter without feeling liking an outsider.
Before you know it The Daily is the only
extracurricular activity you do and all you
ever see of your roommate is the back of
their sleeping head. You don't realize just
how involved you've become until at the
semi-annual end-of-the-volume awards
banquet you are the recipient not of the
"Oh, you still work here?" award but the
"Getting sucked in" award.
1 received it this year, and so I find my
self now as summer editor of the weekly
issue of the paper which The Daily puts out

in the summer. If someone had told me
four summers ago that this is the job I'd be
holding when 1 was at a similar juncture in
my life (then entering my junior year of
high school and now entering my junior
year of college), I probably would have paid
them no heed and returned to watching the
Olympic games that were being held in At
lanta that year.
But here I am, and I can't think of any
thing else I'd rather be doing. Though one
might think that much less goes on at Stan
ford during the summer than any other
time of year, this summer looks to be par
ticularly busy. Many Stanford students will
be competing for coveted spots on the
teams that will be heading to Sydney in Sep
tember to compete in the Olympics. A

change of the guard will be taking place,
and it is hoped that a resolution will be
reached in the nurse strike currently hap
pening at Stanford and Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital.
We here at The Weekly look forward to
bringing you these stories and more. We
are here to serve you and hope that you
would not hesitate to contact us if there is
something going on which you would like
to see covered or if you are interested in
working for us in any capacity. Who knows,
you just might get sucked in.
Welcome to this summer's first issue of
The Stanford Weekly. Keep an eye out for
us on Thursdays from now until Aug. 31.
