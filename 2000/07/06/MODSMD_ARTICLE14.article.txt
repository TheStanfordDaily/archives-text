# DAILY VIEWPOINT
## Out from under a curse 
### ALICE BROWN STAFF COLUMNIST 
I am not a good traveler. Think of your
worst travel experience: it has hap
pened to me. Twice. And it was worse.
The travel god hates me. He saves up
all his anger and aggression and waits until
I'm going to tly across the country, or em
hark on a long car ride. That's when he
springs the "toxic chemical leak," or the flat
tire in the middle of the night in the pouring
rain. With no phone, no spare tire and no
gas-
Therefore, I was wary of my family's va
cation plans — three weeks of traveling
around Kenya. I had visions of canceled
flights, cars breaking down in the midst of
hungry lions and being stranded in a little
c ity with absolutely no grasp of the Swahili
language.
We were leaving for our trip the day after
I got home from Stanford. I, of course, jeop
ardized this plan by missing my flight from
SFO to Washington D.C., where I live, and
therefore had to wait five hours in the San
Francisco airport before making a connec
tion through Cincinnati on my way home I
then had the good fortune of winding up in
a cab with a driver who managed to turn the
40 minute ride into two hours and 51 min
utes.
So, I arrived home a mere 12 hours be
fore my family was leaving for hell — I
mean, the airport. Amazingly, we didn't miss
our flight to London, but 1 did end up in the

middle seat between a woman who got up
every seven minutes to use the restroom and
a man who snored. Loudly. And for the
whole six and a half hours.
The flight from London to Nairobi was
also uneventful, other than that my itsy bitsy
13-year-old sister Polly fell asleep instantly
and managed to stretch herself out over
three seats, forcing my not-so-itsy 18-year
old sister I lelen onto my lap and me into the
aisle. I still have bruises from the beverage
cart.
Our bags were the very last five off the
plane. That made for a hideous hour of anx
ious waiting, during which 1 resigned myself
to spending the next three weeks wearing a
stained T-shirt with a picture of a crab on it
and the words "Don't bother me — I'm crab
by." I decided of all shirts to be stuck in, this
one was pretty good. At least it fit my mood.
And then, bags in hand, eyes drooping,
stomachs grumbling, travel became a
dream. The two guides leading our safari
met us outside the baggage claim and loaded
us into two Land Rovers. They had food and
water waiting, and once we refueled they
whisked us out of the city and into the bush.
Our trip was fantastic. We went to three
game parks in Kenya — Shaba, Amboseli
and the Maasai Mara — and the Mahale
Chimpanzee reserve on Lake Tanganyika in
Tanzania. No flat tires, no deaths, no plane
crashes, no malaria, no cheetah attacks and
no fires. 1 was amazed.
Of course I was more amazed by the ab
solutely incredible landscapes, the migrat

ing herds of wildebeest, the flocks of flamin
gos, the lion prides and the bull elephants
with five-foot tusks. 1 will never forget the
noisy pods of hippos sitting in stagnant pools
of water, the leopard dragging her kill into a
tree, the baby giraffes running to keep up
with their mothers or the chimpanzee that
walked past us, close enough to touch. East
Africa is a magical place.
And thus leaving was not only awful be
cause it meant 47 million hours of being "in
transit," but because we were ending three
perfect weeks. In 21 days, the nearest disas
ter was when Polly, riding on top of one of
the Land Rovers, decided to perform a
dance for the other Rover and ended up
falling off.
The Nairobi airport was packed the night
of our departure, and our plane left two
hours late. That meant that our layover in

London was only nine hours, instead of 1 1.
When we checked in at 6 a.m. at the British
Airways ticket counter for our 3:30 p.m.
flight, the woman looked at us like we were
crazy. Our seats were some of the worst on
the plane, and she said she'd try to at least
put us all together. Great.
By 2:45 p.m., when we were in line to
board, my butt hurt from sitting, my teeth
hurt from eating, and my eyes hurt from
reading. That's why 1 didn't trust them
when my dad handed out the tickets and I
saw that I was in seat 7a. SEVEN. Not 8291,
as it should've been.
When we got on the plane it became clear
exactly how sorry for us the ticket agent felt:
she'd upgraded us to first class. 1 nearly
cried.
Maybe, finally, the travel god is smiling
on me.
