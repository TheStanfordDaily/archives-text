## LSU shatters the Cardinal's dreams 
### BRETT KAUFMAN STAFF WRITER 
()MAII A, Neb.— One swing of the bat
was all it took for a near-sure thing 20
minutes prior to come crumbling down
and put the Louisiana State Tigers atop
the collegiate baseball world once again.
Brad Cresse's RBI single in the bottom
ol the ninth inning of the College World
Series championship game broke a 5-5 tie
and gave the Tigers (52-17) their fifth
title — all in the last 10 years. The senior
catcher drove in sophomore Ryan Theri
ot against right-hander Justin Wayne,
who had relieved starter Jason Young for
Stanford (50-16) in the fifth.
"What was going through my mind
was to swing at that slider," Cresse said of
his late-inning heroics. Wayne "had
struck me out twice with the same pitch,
so I had to hit one of them some time."
Wayne was masterful for three innings
of work, getting seven of his nine outs on
strikeouts. However, he ran into trouble
in the eighth with a three-run lead and
just five outs to go to the third national
championship in Stanford history.
The Tigers looked as if they were re
signed to let Wayne, the fifth choice in the
Major League Baseball draft, dominate
them and cruise to victory in his final col
legiate appearance. But the momentum,
along with Wayne's performance, deteri
orated quickly in the eighth.

Wayne induced the leadoff hitter to
foul-out to catcher Damien Alvarado, and
once again the LSU faithful groaned as
their Tigers could not muster anything
off the highly-touted junior. But as large
as the three-run cushion seemed, it van
ished without warning — inspirational
leader Blair Barbier first fired a solo shot
to left field and then senior Jeremy Wit
ten launched a two-run bomb to tie the
ballgame and leave Stanford in a daze.
"They capitalized on the mistakes we
made late in the game and that can't hap
pen in this [championship game],"
Wayne said. " They were good swings.
When a pitch goes that far it's hard to tell
ii it was breaking or not. So, 1 give them
credit. They hit some good pitches."
While Wayne spoke for the team's mis
takes, he spoke more for his own. For
whatever reason, his ability to stifle the
Tiger hitters ended and his confidence
was shaken beyond repair after the first
home run in the eighth.
The shock could not be overcome in
the top of the ninth with a Cardinal rally,
as Stanford went down one-two-three
without so much as a whimper. That set
the stage for a single, a walk and Cresse's
game-winning single to seal the victory in
the bottom of the inning.
Head coach Mark Marquess elected to
put Wayne, his ace, back on the mound in
the ninth even with sophomore closer
Jeff Bruksch ready in the bullpen. The

nod of confidence from the Cardinal
skipper did not have the desired effect on
Wayne, who was visibly shaken by the
change of tide in the dugout between in
nings, and left a chorus of second
guessers in the press room.
"It was a tough one to lose," Marquess

said. "It was a great game, and unfortu
nately we came up short. We didn't give it
to them, they took it. It was a very im
pressive LSU team that found a way to get
the big hit when they had to, and you've
