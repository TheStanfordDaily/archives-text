## LSU shatters the Cardinal's dreams 
### BRETT KAUFMAN STAFF WRITER 
()MAII A, Neb.— One swing of the bat
was all it took for a near-sure thing 20
minutes prior to come crumbling down
and put the Louisiana State Tigers atop
the collegiate baseball world once again.
Brad Cresse's RBI single in the bottom
ol the ninth inning of the College World
Series championship game broke a 5-5 tie
and gave the Tigers (52-17) their fifth
title — all in the last 10 years. The senior
catcher drove in sophomore Ryan Theri
ot against right-hander Justin Wayne,
who had relieved starter Jason Young for
Stanford (50-16) in the fifth.
"What was going through my mind
was to swing at that slider," Cresse said of
his late-inning heroics. Wayne "had
struck me out twice with the same pitch,
so I had to hit one of them some time."
Wayne was masterful for three innings
of work, getting seven of his nine outs on
strikeouts. However, he ran into trouble
in the eighth with a three-run lead and
just five outs to go to the third national
championship in Stanford history.
The Tigers looked as if they were re
signed to let Wayne, the fifth choice in the
Major League Baseball draft, dominate
them and cruise to victory in his final col
legiate appearance. But the momentum,
along with Wayne's performance, deteri
orated quickly in the eighth.

Wayne induced the leadoff hitter to
foul-out to catcher Damien Alvarado, and
once again the LSU faithful groaned as
their Tigers could not muster anything
off the highly-touted junior. But as large
as the three-run cushion seemed, it van
ished without warning — inspirational
leader Blair Barbier first fired a solo shot
to left field and then senior Jeremy Wit
ten launched a two-run bomb to tie the
ballgame and leave Stanford in a daze.
"They capitalized on the mistakes we
made late in the game and that can't hap
pen in this [championship game],"
Wayne said. " They were good swings.
When a pitch goes that far it's hard to tell
ii it was breaking or not. So, 1 give them
credit. They hit some good pitches."
While Wayne spoke for the team's mis
takes, he spoke more for his own. For
whatever reason, his ability to stifle the
Tiger hitters ended and his confidence
was shaken beyond repair after the first
home run in the eighth.
The shock could not be overcome in
the top of the ninth with a Cardinal rally,
as Stanford went down one-two-three
without so much as a whimper. That set
the stage for a single, a walk and Cresse's
game-winning single to seal the victory in
the bottom of the inning.
Head coach Mark Marquess elected to
put Wayne, his ace, back on the mound in
the ninth even with sophomore closer
Jeff Bruksch ready in the bullpen. The

nod of confidence from the Cardinal
skipper did not have the desired effect on
Wayne, who was visibly shaken by the
change of tide in the dugout between in
nings, and left a chorus of second
guessers in the press room.
"It was a tough one to lose," Marquess

said. "It was a great game, and unfortu
nately we came up short. We didn't give it
to them, they took it. It was a very im
pressive LSU team that found a way to get
the big hit when they had to, and you've

got to give them credit, and they deserve
it."
Many of the Cardinal's post-game com
ments were directed at its own inability to
take advantage of scoring chances during
the game, and rightly so. Stanford strand
ed 11 baserunners and failed to score in a
bases loaded situation in the sixth which,
with Wayne cruising along, could have put
the game out of reach.
"We had some opportunities to get a lit
tle bit bigger lead and didn't take advan
tage of it, but I'm very proud of this team,
it's been a very special one," Marquess
said.
It was not simply that the Cardinal did
not capitalize when it should have — LSU
came up with several championship-cal
iber performances of its own. In the third,
junior Ray Wright made what was instant
ly dubbed one of the greatest catches in
CWS history as he lept above the wall to
rob Stanford's Edmund Muth of a home
run.
The crowd of 24,282 at Rosenblatt Sta
dium was almost completely purple and
gold in support of the Bayou Bengals, es
pecially those fans packed into the bleach
ers — and fans decked in LSU garb
cleared the way for Wright to take Muth's
bomb away in the first row of the stands.
Then, for the final four innings, senior
reliever and CWS Most Outstanding Play
er Trey Hodges shut down the Cardinal

attack by allowing just two hits.
"1 just tried to go out there every time 1
got on the mound and compete," Hodges
said. "My arm was a little sore when 1 went
out there, but when Jeremy [Witten] hit
that home run all the soreness left me."
Perhaps lost in the devastating outcome
for Stanford were the highlights of the day
for a team that performed like champions
all season long. Senior Craig Thompson
was set to be the hero after sending a
grand slam over the left-field wall in the
fourth inning, putting Stanford ahead
until the fateful eighth.
"I was just looking to get a ball in the air
and score at least one runner," he said. "If
you get the ball in the air here at this ball
park, you've got a good chance of it going
out, and luckily it did."
Also, junior starter Jason Young battled
and limited the Tigers to just two runs in
his four innings of work — a tough task
when facing a team that had averaged al
most 10 runs per contest in the 2000 CWS.
The heartbreaking finale to the Cardi
nal's third trip to Omaha in the past four
years marred the last college game for the
team's nucleus of five seniors: Alvarado,
Eric Bruntlett, John Call, Muth and
Thompson and three juniors: Joe Bor
chard, Wayne, and Young — likely head
ed to professional ball.
The events of the game, however disap
pointing, will not dictate how this unique
blend of experience and talent is remem
bered in years to come.
Their mark on Stanford baseball was so
overwhelmingly positive that one swing of
the bat — even Cresse's — cannot erase it.
