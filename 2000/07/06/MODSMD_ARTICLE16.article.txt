# Baseball faces an uncertain future

### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
OMAHA, Neb. — The laces
stared glumly out of the dugout as
you looked down the line, taking in
LSU's celebration on the field.
There they were, the men who had
propelled the Stanford baseball
team to the verge of a national
championship. Muth. Gall.
Thompson. Bruntlett. Alvarado.
For an entire season, the five
starting seniors had provided their
team with a multitude of riches:
clutch hits, leadership, solid de
fense, and perhaps most impor
tantly. an identity. Now all five are
gone, having inked contracts with
professional teams, and looking
forward to a future of lives on
buses, in small towns and even
smaller ballparks.
The team they leave behind,
also bereft of juniors Jason Young,

Justin Wayne and Joe Borchard, is
one full of question marks and
untested sophomores. Only three
starters will return from the lineup
coach Mark Marquess relied upon
in the College World Series: soon
to-be juniors Chris O'Riordan (at
second base), Andy Topham (in
leftfield) and Arik Van Zandt (at
designated hitter).
Exactly who steps in to replace
the departed and where they will
end up is something nobody, not
even Marquess himself, knows at
this point. Topham may move into
the infield, his original position, as
could Van Zandt. Jason Cooper,
the much-hyped hard-hitting out
fielder who had an underwhelm
ing freshman season, is a good bet
for one of the outfield spots.
Sophomores Mario Garza and Ken
Tit pack face the unenviable task of
taking over for Damien Alvarado
behind the plate, one of the most
crucial positions given Alvarado's
stellar defense and repor with the
pitching staff.
The pitching staff is in even
more of a quandry. Two hurlers,
(either lucky or unlucky depend
ing on how you look at it) must take
over for departed Ail-Americans
Young and Wayne, who provided
the Cardinal with a wealth of solid
starts over the course of their two
years in the rotation.
Sophomore Tim Cunningham
and junior Mike Gosling are the
likely candidates for those spots,
while Brian Sager will jump into
the No. 1 starter's role. Coming off
an injury-marred year, the ques
tion with Sager is whether he can
do more than show flashes of bril
liance and pitch consistently for an
entire season.
Fortunately for Cardinal fans,
Marquess and his coaching staff
worked their usual magic in there

cruiting wars and are bringing in a
crop of talented players for next
year. Outfielder Sam Fuld, out of
New Hampshire, looks to bring a
combination of a solid bat and ex
cellent speed to the Stanford line
up, possibly as a leadoff hitter.
Brian Hall, a shortstop from New
Mexico and veteran of the Junior
National Team, could be a capable
replacement for Bruntlett in the in
field.
()n the mound, California pitch
er Andrew Erlich appears to be the
gem of the new class of throwers
pitching coach Tom Kunis will
have to mold into dependable
pitchers.
Regardless of how many talent
ed players he has coming down the
pipeline, Marquess can't immedi
ately replace the calm and experi
ence provided by players who
started for most of their careers,
like Muth, Borchard and Gall. A
much younger, greener group is
replacing those tried-and-true vet
erans with a mass of question
marks, and it will be up to the man
who has become synonymous with
Stanford baseball to turn them into
a team.
