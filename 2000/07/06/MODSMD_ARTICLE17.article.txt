### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Possibly kicking off a new trend in collegiate
athletics, University officials recently announced
that all commercial advertisements within Stan
ford Stadium and Maples Pavilion will be re
moved in time for the 2000-2001 school year.
In one of his final acts as Univeristy president
before he steps down on Aug. 31, Gerhard
Casper handed down the mandate in response to
what he perceives as a mass commercialization of
college sports.
"If you look at collegiate athletics overall, it has
received so much attention that... it is becom
ing part of a vast entertainment industry,"
Casper told the San Francisco Chronicle.
"This is clearly atypical of college athletics
around the country," said assistant athletic direc
tor Gary Migdol in the Chronicle. "College ath
letics is moving in a direction for more commer
cialization, which is controversial. I think this
move made by Stanford sets it apart."
According to Department of Athletics officials,
90 percent of the signs within Stanford Stadium
and Maples will be removed, with the rest being

phased out as placement agreements expire over
time.
The announcement does not mean Stanford
will be completely devoid of banners and signage,
as advertisements pertaining to the Athletic De
partment, the Department's Web site and ticket
sales will remain. Furthermore, television and
radio stations broadcasting Stanford games will
also be allowed to hang banners.
The decision won't be without repercussions.
Most athletic departments derive a significant
amount of revenue from adveitising and place
ment contracts, money that Stanford's Athletic
Department will have to receive from other
sources. Casper freely admitted as much, saying
that the Athletic Department would "have a very,
very, hard time meeting its budget" without the
sponsorship of various advertisers.
As for tbt' omnipresent "swoosh," representa
tive of Nike and located on most team jerseys, it
won't be going anywhere soon, according to
Casper.
"In the best of all possible worlds, one would
look at that, but there is no question that the kind
of quality Athletic Department we operate does
need outside funding," Casper said.
