# Mad Dog heads to L.A.
## Lakers take Madsen 29th overall in draft 
### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
On a team that already has Su
perman, the Zen Master and The
Kid, the Los Angeles Lakers decid
ed to make room for a Mad Dog.
With the 29th pick in last
Wednesday's NBA Draft, the Los
Angeles Lakers grabbed none
other than the Stanford basketball
team's heart and soul of the past
lew years, power forward Mark
Madsen. Conveniently for the re
cent graduate of the Farm, the
Lakers earlier waived the starting
power forward from their recent
NBA title-winning team, A.C.
Green, opening up a starting spot
at what was already the thinnest
position on the floor for Shaquille
O'Neal & Co.
"1 can't tell you how fortunate 1
feel right now," Madsen told the
San Francisco Chronicle. "They
have scorers, two great players,
great talent all around. My
strengths are going in there and

playing defense and rebounding. I
feel like that's something that can
help the Lakers."
Given the typical track record of
picks at the end of the first round
in recent years (Leon Smith, any
one.-), it may be a bit premature to
pencil Madsen in the L.A. starting
lineup or even to get substantial
playing time. While the 6-foot-9,
240 pound forward brings limitless
qualities of hustle and toughness
under the boards, in the NBA the
gap between him and stronger,
more athletic forwards will grow
even larger.
The Lakers are likely to sign a
veteran power forward in the off
season for their $2.2 million salar\
cap exception, and it is not out of
I lie realm of possibility that they
would re-sign Green at a lower
price, making Madsen's chances of
cracking the starting lineup slim.
1 hat being said, with the atti
tude and grit Madsen brings to the
table, it would be a mistake to
count him out of contributing sig
nificantly during the course of the
season. If anyone can grasp the nu
ances and details of Laker coach
PI lil Jackson s a implicated triangle
offense, it is the scholarly Madsen,

who certainly got tlie most out of
his education at the Farm.
"The one thing that I will im
press upon you, this might be the
toughest guy in the whole draft,"
Lakers executive vice president
Jerry West told the Los Angeles
Times. "I le knows how to defend,
likes to throw his body around, so
we probably needed a player like
that. . . There were some other
people we liked a lot. But 1 think
this more fits our need — it kind of
addresses the A.C. Green situa
tion."
According to the NBA rookie
pay scale, which is based on draft
ing position, Madsen will receive a
guaranteed contract worth $2 mil
lion over three seasons.
Over his four years with the
Cardinal, Madsen quickly became
a favorite of the Sixth Man Club
due to his overtly physical style and
tenacious rebounding, which
earned him the nickname "Mad
Dog" back in fifth grade.
During his career on the Farm,
Madsen averaged 10.9 points and
7.9 rebounds per game, and was
named third team All-American
and first team All-Pac 10 in his se
nior season.
