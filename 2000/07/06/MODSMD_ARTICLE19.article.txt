# Runners descend on the Farm
## 
### BEN ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For the fifth time this year, fields of the nation's best
track and field athletes converged on Stanford's Cobb
Track and Angell Field Saturday, this time for the CMC
Envoy Open.
And as has come to be expected at a Stanford-hosted
meet, it was the Cardinal athletes, past and present, who
made the races exciting to behold.
Stanford alum Regina Jacobs dominated the 800-
meter run, junior Sally Clynn bolted to a fearsome time in
the 1,500 meters and a trio of thoroughbreds from Stan
ford's distance stable —junior Michael Stember, sopho
more Jonathon Riley and freshman Andy Powell — took
the men's 1,500 races to another level of comptetion.
Fhe Open marked the USATF's strongest effort to of
ficially "bring international-caliber track and field back
to the Bay Area." Not that Stanford track and field need
ed much help — with head coach Vin Lananna's pull in
elite-athlete spheres, international competition has be
come an almost weekly event at Stanford.
But Saturday marked the first nationally televised
meet at Cobb Track. And complete with a group ot Sene
galese drummers to keep runners in pace, a near-capac
ity crowd of over 4,000 and a $99,000 pot ol prize money
to be split among top finishers, top performances were
expected.
While stacking up loot was a driver for the profession
als, those banned from collecting booty (the collegians)
used the meet to tune up and perhaps grab a late qualifi
er for the Olympic Trials in two weeks.
In the women's 1,500, Clynn did just that. Expected to
contest the 5,000-meters at the I rials, most saw Clynn s
entrance in the 1,500 as a tune-up for the longer dis
tance. But when Clynn made her move to stay among the
leaders with 500 meters to go, it was clear that she was
also ready for the shorter race.

Junior Michael Stember turned in an impressive showing in the
1500 meters at the GMC Envoy Open last weekend.
Surging over the final lap, Glynn ran
neck and neck with Colorado's Kara
Wheeler, the NCAA champion over 3,000
and 5,000 meters. Though Wheeler
nipped her at the line by .05 seconds,
Glynn's 4 minute, 12.56 second clocking
was an 8,5-second personal record and
nearly eclipsed both the Stanford
(4:12.30, Regina Jacobs) and Pacific 10
Conference (4:12.05, Grazyna Penc,
USC) records while qualifying her for the
Trials at that distance.
In the men's 1,500, Stember had his
work cut out for him in a field comprised
of international stars, including Kenyans
Martin Keino and Sammy Langat.
Though Langat took the field through
400 meters in 56 seconds, a pace too fast
for the field to hold, Stember ran wisely,
hanging back until the final 300 meters,
when he screamed to the lead.
Jason Pyrah, a 1996 Olympian, gave
chase and tracked Stember down, finish
ing in 3:38.22 to Stember's 3:39.06.
But Stanford's showing at that distance
was not yet over. In the Olympic Develop
ment section, designed for what was sup
posed to be a second tier of athletes, Riley
and Powell ruled the day.
Also running near the middle of the
pack for much of the race, the duo didn't

go for the kill until the final lap, when
Riley simply overwhelmed the field with a
blistering kick.
With Powell in tow, Riley crushed the
field with his personal best 3:38.90 clock
ing, with Powell just back at 3:40.65, an
other lifetime best and only .15 seconds
off a qualifier for the Trials.
Sophomore Gabe Jennings did not
race due to a sore hamstring, an injury
that will not keep him out of the Trials.
The 5,000 saw recent grads Jason Balk
man and Nathan Nutter go 2-3 in
13:46.46 and 13:50.95, respectively.
Meanwhile, redshirting freshman An
drew Hill squeaked under the 14:20 stan
dard at 14:19.68 to solidify his spot at the
Junior World Championships, an honor
he earned by winning the Junior Nation
al 5,000 two weeks ago.
Among the world-class competitors, Ja
cobs made a strong showing in the 800
with her 2:00.39 win, and Menlo Park's
Adam Nelson, who trains under Stanford
throws coach Robert Weir, heaved the
shot out 71 feet, 2 1/2 inches, good
enough for second in the world this year.
Pole vaulter Stacy Dragila, who was on
hand attempting to break her world
record of 15 feet (she ended the competi
tion in first at 14-10 1/2), was pleased with
the Stanford setting.
"This is wonderful," Dragila said. "It's
like a meet they put on in Europe.
"It's so good to have a meet like this in
the States."
