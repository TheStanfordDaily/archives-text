# Runners descend on the Farm

### BEN ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For the fifth time this year, fields of the nation's best
track and field athletes converged on Stanford's Cobb
Track and Angell Field Saturday, this time for the CMC
Envoy Open.
And as has come to be expected at a Stanford-hosted
meet, it was the Cardinal athletes, past and present, who
made the races exciting to behold.
Stanford alum Regina Jacobs dominated the 800-
meter run, junior Sally Clynn bolted to a fearsome time in
the 1,500 meters and a trio of thoroughbreds from Stan
ford's distance stable —junior Michael Stember, sopho
more Jonathon Riley and freshman Andy Powell — took
the men's 1,500 races to another level of comptetion.
Fhe Open marked the USATF's strongest effort to of
ficially "bring international-caliber track and field back
to the Bay Area." Not that Stanford track and field need
ed much help — with head coach Vin Lananna's pull in
elite-athlete spheres, international competition has be
come an almost weekly event at Stanford.
But Saturday marked the first nationally televised
meet at Cobb Track. And complete with a group ot Sene
galese drummers to keep runners in pace, a near-capac
ity crowd of over 4,000 and a $99,000 pot ol prize money
to be split among top finishers, top performances were
expected.
While stacking up loot was a driver for the profession
als, those banned from collecting booty (the collegians)
used the meet to tune up and perhaps grab a late qualifi
er for the Olympic Trials in two weeks.
In the women's 1,500, Clynn did just that. Expected to
contest the 5,000-meters at the I rials, most saw Clynn s
entrance in the 1,500 as a tune-up for the longer dis
tance. But when Clynn made her move to stay among the
leaders with 500 meters to go, it was clear that she was
also ready for the shorter race.
