## Wayne must soldier on 
### 
OMAHA, Neb. None of us — at
least, those of us that dared to
maneuver for a glimpse —
know what the look, on Justin
Wayne's face meant as he walked into the
team hotel after watching one of his best
ever outings deteriorate into that of his
worst nightmare.
How he mustered enough courage to
walk past the fans, friends, family and
media continues to baffle me.
About two hours beforehand, could
the day have been any more perfect for
the young Hawaiian?
He was on track to receive a Stanford
degree ahead of schedule. He was the
fifth overall pick in the Major League
Baseball amateur draft. He was widely
considered to be the prospect best-pre
pared for the major leagues. He had
struck out seven batters in three innings
in the NCAA Championship Game and
was five outs from earning the victory for
his team's third-ever national title.
Bam. All of those blessings left the pic
ture in a flash — and in thousands of flash
bulbs that captured a purple and gold
mob scene.
National television cameras pried into
the Cardinal dugout and found a dis
traught Wayne, head draped in a towel,
after he allowed LSU to mount an im
probable comeback and tie the game on
two home runs in the eighth inning.
Anyone that could bring himself to
watch knew that this was not the same
pitcher that had taken the mound min
utes earlier. He was tired, frustrated,
angry.. .broken.
Sitting in the press box, we all knew
what none of us could or would say — it
was tied, but barring a miracle, this one
was over. And then slowly, the nightmare
became full blown — a hit, a walk and a
made-for-SportsCenter hero in Brad
(iresse.
For just an instant I saw Wayne slump
ing into the hotel, and countless times in
too many replays 1 watched Cresse's back

bending roar to the skies as the winning
run crossed the plate. But Wayne's visage
is the one indelibly stamped into my
mind, and most likely will never go away.
Six months with a team will do that to
you.
Will the 21 -year old kid — yes, he's still
a kid — ever be able to overcome his
Omaha disaster?
It's too early to tell. But it is safe to say
he is not the first to "blow it"in a major
sporting event.
Mitch Williams did it. He watched his
pitch to Joe Carter disappear over the
wall of SkvDome in Toronto and end the
1993 World Series.
Chris Webber did it, too. His non-exis
tent timeout in the 1993 NCAA, basketball
title game ended his Michigan squad's
chance at victory.
Williams' miscue damaged his psyche
to the point of no return as his career
ended in shame. Webber used his blun
der to motivate his professional life and
now stands as one of the NBA's brightest
stars.
The situation in which Wayne finds
himself is different than those, simply be
cause his was not a single moment during
which his talents failed him. His pain ex
udes from a prolonged period that found
him mentally absent from the game.
Even after the devastating eighth and
ninth at theCWS, no one doubts Wayne's
physical skills. He has incredible com
mand of four above-average pitches and
a mature approach that unquestionably
qualify him as one of the best new
prospects in baseball.
But now the biggest question mark for
Wayne — not to mention the Montreal
Expos, who selected him in the first
round of the draft — is his strength of
mind. Can he bounce back and become
the player lie and the Expos believe he
will be? Or will five outs that he never
could get ruin his baseball life?
For now, that look on his face is answer
enough.
