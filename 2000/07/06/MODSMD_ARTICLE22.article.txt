## Chickens shine in breakout performance 
### MICHAEL BAER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It has been hard to avoid the
media onslaught and glowing de
scriptions of "Chicken Run,"the
first feature-length movie by Nick
Park and Peter Lord, those British
stop-motion animators who creat
ed the "Wallace and Gromit"
shorts. By the time I stepped in the
theater, I felt I know most of the
story and had high expectations.
But "Chicken Run" not only
delivered, it also surprised as a
film that achieves the cliche few
films ever do — being fun for the
whole family (or your whole dor
mitory, as the case may be). At my
screening, at least, both kids and
adults loved it, though they didn't
always laugh at the same parts.
Just in case you've been in a cave
the last couple of weeks, the plot is
as follows: numbers of chick
ens are being held against their will
in a farm. In the process of doing
forced labor (egg laying), they
know that failure to produce will
result in their going from egg lay
ers to chicken pie dinners for the
evil British farmer Mrs. Tweedy
(voiced by Miranda Richardson,
"The Crying Game," "Sleepy Hol
low") and her dimwitted husband

(Tony Haygarth, "I, Claudius").
Meanwhile, Ginger (Julia Sawalha,
"Absolutely Fabulous") — the most
spirited of the hens — hatches plan
after plan for them all to escape to
freedom, plans which sadly fail.
The other hens respond in various
ways to these failures, though Mr.
Tweedy's response is usually to
give Ginger what she calls "solitary
confinement," or what one bird
brained comrade (Jane Horrocks,
"Absolutely Fabulous") calls "holi
day."
This tedious existence is inter
rupted by the arrival of Rocky the
Rooster (Mel Gibson, "Brave
heart"), on the lam from the cir
cus. In exchange for hiding him,
Ginger makes Rocky train the
chickens to fly, something he real
izes is a rather unlikely prospect.
He tries to make the best of his sit
uation — being trapped with hun
dreds of single female chicks. All
the while, Ginger eggs him on to
help bring them to the day where
they can all fly out of there and es
cape a grave new threat brought
by Mrs. Tweety. For reasons of de
cency, one might assume, she has
him sleep with the only other male
chicken, the crusty old rooster
Fowler (Benjamin Whitrow,
"Chaplin") who is quite resentful

of the attention this "Yank" is get
ting.
The humor isn't as fast-paced
as one might expect from such a
comedy, but the imagery — from
somber to hilarious — is priceless.
After seeing a few previews and
articles, I had been worried the
whole movie would be too famil
iar, but the second half took off—
so to speak — in an unexpectedly
delightful manner.
The movie references are espe
cially delicious, as every decade of
modern film has a well-known
movie spoofed in a way which
serves to heighten — not weigh
down — the plot of "Chicken
Run." So too does the use of
British vernacular and two thiev
ing rats who not only help the
hens (for chicken feed, no less),
but also serve as a peanut-gallery,
adding to the overall feel of the
film. The much-discussed
painstaking two-year effort to
turn Plasticine chickens into
"Chicken Run" is only appreciat
ed for its final, beautiful result —
much ahead of the days when
claymation meant dancing raisins
and "Creature Comforts."
Though it may not convince all
its viewers to become vegetarians
(Burger King, with a "Chicken

Run" tie-in, is certainly counting
on few following this path), it does
draw us into the world of talking
British hens, desperate, yet hope
ful, for escape. And if you're look
ing for escape as well, a trip to
your movie theater to see this one
is likely your best bet.
