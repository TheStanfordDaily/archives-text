# Gibson shows off his 'Patriot'-ism
## 
### MONYA DE EDITORIAL STAFF 
In an interview, Mel Gibson said,
"History repeats itself. Gentury by
century, decade by decade .. .victo
ries and defeats. Those are the kind
of stories that I like."
1 le must have really meant it. (Gib
son's 1776 extravaganza, "The Patri
ot." echoes "Braveheart" even more
than the previews suggest. Straight
from the screenwriters of "Saving
Private Ryan" comes another story of
ragged men who grab anything that
pokes and take on fields full of natti
ly dressed British officers. And even
more than in "Braveheart," this
one's all about Mel, Mel, Mel.
Gibson is Benjamin Martin, an
ex-soldier and champion single dad
of seven. (I won't even go into the nu
merous "Sound of Music" parallels
in this film. Some of the kids even
look like the Von Trapps.) Fvery
one's begging him to fight in the im
pending war, but, modern 18th-cen
tury dad that he is, he feels his place
is at home. But, when his oldest son,
Gabriel, disobeys him, joins the fight
and consequently leads the conflict

right onto the family's front porch,
Martin has no choice.
Almost instantly, the pastoral facade
of the film's opening scenes drops away
and Martin is awash in blood, hac king
at the Ixxly of a Redcoat who tries to
cart his son away for hanging. It is slow
ly revealed that Martin was a brutal
killer during the French and Indian
War, the reas* >n for his regard as a hero
among Americans. The rest of the film
doesn't let up in violence; this is defi
nitely not a film for the faint of heart, es
pecially considering the several dis
turbing scenes involving kids and
guns. But, there's a reason Gibson
keeps d< )ing these m< >vies; he's in his el
ement covered in blood. By contrast,
his believability when he speaks to the
leaders of the colonies about avoiding
armed conflict is minimal at best.
'Ihe l>attle scenes are well done, as
expected. "Gladiator" is probably
more shocking, but you'll see your
share of flying extremities here. Slow
motion Ls used to gleeful excess, espe
cially in Gibson's conflict with Jason
Isaacs. Isaacs plays the super-bad guy
Tavington, die Redcoat with zero
morals and what l<x>k like evil green
contact lenses.

The reading on the chick flick
meter is about .01 for this movie.
Martin's wile gets picked of! before
the film has even started, and Royal
Academy of Dramatic Art-trained
Joely Richardson, as Martin's sister
in-law, does not have the opportuni
ty to show oil the talent that got her
there. Richardson and Lisa Brenner,
who plays Gabriel's love interest,
mostly smile and wear pretty dresses
(Richardson is rigged to look exactly
like Gwyneth Faltrow in "Shake
speare in Love"). The romance
ranges from inexplicable for the
adults to mildly cute for the teens, but
never anything more. Brenner gets
to show oil her character's pn>to-fem
inist ideals in one good scene in which
she recruits men for the militia, but it
still feels forced and politically correct
in the context of how little we really
learn about her.
112 leath I ledger does a line job with
his role as (Jibson's son (iabriel, grin
ning goofily at his future wife and
bravely facing the terrifying Taving
ton. Already on the cover of every
teen magazine under such headlines
as "Heath the Hottie," look for him
to replace an aging Brad Pitt as

everyone's favorite blond romantic
lead. Tom Wilkinson, playing the
British Lord General Cornwallis, a
military genius, does not achieve the
same balance. 1 lis comedic touch, fa
miliar from his role as Gerald in
"The Full Monty" is perfect, but one
can't quite accept him as the brilliant
leader of the army.
Technically, there is a lot of atten
tion to detail, as films continue to
raise the bar for seamlessness. How
ever, several scenes squeaked
through that just look artificial, par
ticularly the swamp scenes with the
fog machine pumping away. Anoth
er problem is John Williams' score.
The man gets less subtle with each

film, and several suspenseful mo
ments were demolished by the in
trusive orchestra.
Ultimately, "The Patriot" is a vic
tim of its own length and historical
simplicity and loses the immortality it
could have had. Still, the story is en
gaging and the performances are ser
viceable, making it a feel-patriotic
film for the colonial in all of us. Now
go wave that flag.
