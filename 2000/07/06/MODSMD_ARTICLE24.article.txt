Despite healthy early grosses, "Me, Myself,
8c Irene," the latest film from the Farrelly
Brothers' ("Dumb and Dumber," "There's
Something About Mary"), has been the victim
of attacks from both critics and audiences,
which, in my mind, are misplaced.
These criticisms seem to lx- based not on
"Irene" itself, but on the success of the direc
tors' previous two efforts, "Mary," the break
out hit of 1998, and 1996's "Kingpin".
When viewed alongside these two films,
"Me, Myself, 8c Irene's' flaws are obvious. It
lacks the strand of sheer hilarity that ran
through the brothers' last two movies, never
reaching the comedic level of the zipper scene
in "Mar)," or the film's hysterical flog se
quences. Instead, the film is left with some not
icable dull spots that give the audience too
much time to reflect on a plodine thinner than
the other two stories.
Vet if we forgive Peter and Bobby Farrelly
for failing to live up to their previous efforts,
we can recognize "Irene" for what it truly is: a
film that, while flawed, is easily the funniest
movie so far this year (with the exception of

"Mission to Mars").
As the film opens, we see Charlie Bailey
gates, a Rhode Island state trooper, (Jim Car
rey in perhaps his best comic performance yet)
marrying the love of his life, Layla (Traylor
Howard). Right after the wedding, however,
Layla falls for Shonte (Tony Cox), an African-
American.
When, nine months later, the couple's
triplets are Ixn 11 with, as one unkind neighbor
puts it, "year-round tans," it is clear to every
one in the town except Charlie that the chil
dren are not his. The movie then flashes for
ward six years to I .ay la running off with
Shonte and leaving Charlie alone with the
three kids: Jamaal, 1 larvey and Shonte Jr.
(one of dozens of good, small jokes in the film).
From this point on, Charlie, a kind, gentle
man, internalizes all his anger and frustration
and avoids confrontation at all costs. While this
makes him a caring father, it also makes him
weak and ineffective, especially as a cop.
I lis bottled up anger leads to the creation of
Hank, another personality inside of him who
makes his entranee, 12 years later, in hilarious
fashion. Hank, though not evil, lx>rders on
psychotic and is (Charlie's antithesis: a sexually
voracious jerk who picks a fight with everyone

lie meets.
Carrey plays I lank by speaking in a comi
cally sadisUc whisper, chain smoking and mov
ing with an exaggerated swagger. While the
actor generates a decent amount of laughs as
the kind-hearted but slow-witted Charlie, it is
the scenes with Hank that carry the film.
Though most of the characters in the film
live in fear of Hank, 1 (and much of the audi
ence) could not wait Ibr his next entrance.
After the appearance of Hank, Charlie
meets Irene Waters (Renee Zellweger), a feisty
groundskeeper wanted on a bogus warrant,
whom he escorts from Rhode Island to up
state New York.
Soon, the story becomes a love triangle Ix 1 -
tween Charlie, Irene and 1 lank. A plot device
involving bad cops trying to kill Irene is just an
excuse to keep the two (sorry, three) of them
together and on the run.
While much of the supporting c ast, which
includes Chris Cooper, is wasted, Anthony
Anderson, Mongo Brownlee and Jerod
Mixon are hysterical as the genius triplets,
whose love for Richard Piyor and Chris R<x k
leads to their tendency to swear
incessantly.
If you go to this movie expecting another

"There's Something About Mary", you will
certainly leave this film disappointed. If, on
the other hand, you approach "\le, Myself, and
Irene" without weignty expectations, you will
laugh as hard as you have all year.
