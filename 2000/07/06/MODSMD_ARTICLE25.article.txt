In "Riding with the King," BB King and
Eric Clapton join forces to create a blues
album that is a testament to many of the old
blues classics, as well as a few more modern
songs. Iliis album contains a little of every-

thing but is particularly suited to those who enjoy the classic blues of BB King and others from the
1950s and 19605.
BB King and Eric Clapton, both legends in their own right, have been friends ever since they
met in the late 1900 sin a small nightclub in New York (iity. By tli.it time, BB was already an es
tablished and respected blues musician and Eric (Clapton had just come to the United States after
rising to some prominence in Europe. Since then, both musicians have continued to record songs
and move audiences around the world, although some argue that they have never reached the
heights that were attained in the 1900s.
In this nostalgic album, many of the old and great songs from that era are brought back to us
by these two influential artists. Oldies from the very start of the blues genre such as Key to the
Highway" are coupled with BB King and Eric (llapton classics, as well as some more modern stuff
like "Rifling with the King" from the 1980s.
Ifie songs are well blended, flowing from one to another smoothly and avoiding hasty transi
tions. It has the typical mellow and laid-back atmosphere of the blues and only steps out of that
mode once or twice to mix it up before returning to it again. A few of the more modern songs are
well chosen and performed, but to me they lack the magic of hearing BB King jam on his guitar
the way he might have done almost half a century ago.
It is clear that this album is more than just a compilation of classic blues by two musical artists.
It is a trip down memory lane by two of the men who helped shape the landscape ol a musical
scene for over 50 years. My favorites are the old classics by BB King, like I hree () Clcx.k Blues,
"Help the Poor" and "Days of Old." < >ther more modern songs like "Riding with the King" com
plement those other songs and provide a g<x>d transition between moods on the album.

/\ll in all, this alburn provides a wonderful compilation
of classic bines songs. The fact that it is created by two of
the greatest blues guitarists around makes it a sjKtial col
lection, one that has a lot of sentiment and meaning be
hind it. Both of these musicians have surpassed all expec
tations, and tliis album allows them to collaborate so that
their songs from the past seem to come alive once more.
It's a great album for all those who love classic blues.
