The similarities are too obvious to ig
nore. A private college in California, found
ed in 1891 in an area that was once home to
orange groves and small farms. A campus
architectural motif dominated by Spanish
tile. A small school that grew from its hum
ble beginnings to become world-renowned
in engineering and the sciences. Indeed,
despite the many differences between the
two schools these days, Stanford does seem
to come to mind when describing the Cali
fornia Institute of Technology. But Caltech
is not Stanford and it, in spite of these and
other parallels, is of course a school with its
own history and rich architectural heritage.
"Caltech's Architectural Heritage, From
Spanish Tile to Modern Stone," by Romy
Wyllie, carefully traces Caltech's physical
development from Throop University in
the latter part of the 19th century to the cur
rent day school in Pasadena that is one of
the premier centers of technology in the
world. The author herself is a co-founder of
the architectural tour service at Caltech and
has previously taught architectural history
and interior design at the I larrington Insti
tute of Design in Chicago.
Wyllie begins with a discussion of the
university's founding by Amos Crager
Throop, a New York businessman who l)e
-lieved in the principle of "I-earning by
Doing." When the school transformed its
curriculum from woodworking and cook
ing in the early 1900s to one which concen
trated heavily on engineering, it also un
derwent two name changes and moved to a
different location, which is the foundation
for the current day campus.
The first building of the new campus,
Throop 1 lall, was modeled on Thomas Jef
ferson's design for the University of Vir
ginia. As building continued under the de

sign of architect Bertram Crosvenor (iood
liue, the school developed a largely Spanish
character with several Moorish elements,
combined with others such as Ro
manesque, Byzantine and Cothic. This was
expressed in later planners as well. As Wylie
notes, "kaufmann, Johnson, Coate and
Neff, [architects] using elements from dif
ferent Mediterranean countries, created an
eclectic architecture which became known
as the 'California style."' In fact, the
Athenaeum, considered a social gathering
place for intellectuals to meet and discuss
ideas at the college, is described by Wyllie as
beinga"rich blend of Italian villa and Span
ish hacienda with overtones of rural An
dalusia."
Following World War 11, building
trends moved toward more modern archi
tecture but still retained many elements of
the earlier styles that had marked Caltech
during the first half of the 20th century.
Throughout her work, the author mixes
a history of the school's building pnxess
with a general discussion of Caltech history
as well as an understanding of the person
alities and larger trends behind most of the
projects. Indeed, what it reveals is a careful
ly conceived and well-crafted plan of devel
opment for the college that Ix-lies the
hodge-podge of different sty les present on
the school's campus. For anyone knowl
edgeable about architecture or interested
in learning more (there are numerous pic
tures and diagrams along with rich histori
cal descriptions to accompany the some
times-dry technical details) this book is
worth taking a look at.
