## Etchemendy helping shape Stanford future 
### GREG BRAZEAL EDITORIAL STAFF 
"l think we're very, very close to
being the best university in the en
tire world," Philosophy Chair and
newly appointed Provost John
Etchemendy said, "and I think
there's nothing else for us to do
but strive to be that."
Beginning in September,
Etchemendy will take over the
post of chief academic officer from
John Hennessy, who will replace
Gerhard Casper as University
president.
Both Hennessy and Etche
mendy come to their new posi
tions with reputations for broad
interdisciplinary understanding:
Etchemendy was one of the found
ing members of the Symbolic Sys
tems Program, which combines as
pects of computer science, psy
chology, linguistics and philoso
phy, and Hennessy was a key fig
ure in the foundation of the wide
ranging Bio-X Program.
Breadth is a recurring feature
of Etchemendy's career, which
spans what I lennessy jokingly calls
Stanford's "uncrossable divide,"
the boundary between "techie"
and "fuzzy."
"I think he brings a wonderful
perspective on the humanities,"
Hennessy said of his successor,
"but — just as important — an
ability to talk broadly to his col
leagues across the institution."
In addition to his philosophical
publications, Etchemendy co-au
thored with the late logician Jon
Barwise popular educational soft
ware such as "Turing's World,"
"Tarski's World" and "Hyper

proof." He served both as senior
associate dean in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences and as
founding leader of the presiden
tial Commission on Technology in
Teaching and Learning.
As philosophy chair, Etche
mendy helped expand the depart
ment's focus to emphasize both
the technical and humanistic sides
of the subject. "He's been an out
standing chair of philosophy and
helped lead philosophy to a new
level," 1 lennessy said.
The department had traditional
ly aligned itself more with math and
the sciences than the humanities,
but after it lost nearly half its faculty
in a burst of departures several years
ago, Etchemendy helped point the
department in a more balanced di
rection. It is now not only larger
than it was in the early '90s and, in
his words, "just as strong on the sci
ence and logic side, but also has
great strength in history, ethics and
political philosophy."
"1 think the philosophy depart
ment is a very important part of
the University," Etchemendy said,
"because of its ties to so many dif
ferent disciplines."
One of Stanford's greatest assets,
in Etchemendy's view, is its potential
to excel across such a wide range of
activities, from science and electrical
engineering to music composition
and the humanities. "You don't find
it at Ml 112, you don't find it at Har
vard," he said. "We cover a spec
trum that you don't find elsewhere."
As provost, Etchemendy will
have control over the academic
budget and will be responsible lot
decisions about appointments and
promotions of faculty and, by ex

tension, for the expansion or
diminution of schools and depart
ments. Provosts decide when a
school should be given "billets," or
empty positions for new faculty to
fill.
In response to worries that the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences' budgetary problems might
impede the school's ability to at
tract and retain faculty,
Etchemendy said, "I think that the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences has a difficult budget situa
tion, but I don't think it has ever
had trouble attracting or retaining
faculty. . . . There's the financial
problem, but I don't think it's yel
had any impact on our recruit
ment and retention."
Born in Reno, New,
Etchemendy received his bache
lor's and master's degrees from
the University of Nevada, Reno.
After earning his doctorate at
Stanford, he taught at Princeton,
first as lecturer from 1981 to 1982
and then as assistant professor
from 1982 to 1983. I le has been a
faculty member in the Depart
ment of Philosophy since 1983.
In 1992, Etchemendy became
the first recipient of the Bing
Teaching Award, which cited him
for"the most extraordinarily posi
tive testimony from students." I le
has also been a freshman advisor.
"I'm hoping that I'll eventually
be able to teach at least a course a
year," he said, though he will not
be teaching next year. "As I len
nessy has often said, the best job at
tin' University is being a professor,
not president or provost. Especial
ly if you like to teach, and I like to
teach a lot."

Until very recently,
Etchemendy had no intention of
serving in university administra
tion. "It's a funny thing, that uni
versities are administered by facul
ty. Faculty decide to go into their
profession . . . because they like
their profession, not because they
want to run a large organization."
Etchemendy's perspective
began to change during his tenure
as deputy chair on the committee
that nominated Hennessy to be
president. Drawing a parallel be
tween his own decision and that of
ex-Provost Condoleezza Rice, who
similarly served on the committee
that nominated Casper before ac
cepting the post of provost,
Etchemendy said, "There's an in
teresting fact about spending five

months researching higher educa
tion, thinking about Stanford, try
ing to find the best person con
cerned about the future of the
University.
"You suddenly come to realize
how important university leader
ship really is. And I think that has
a big effect on people. It certainly
had a big effect on me . . . Had it
been a year ago, maybe 1 would
have said, 'I don't want to do that,
1 want to stay in the Philosophy
Department.'
"This will be an awesome re
sponsibility," Etchemendy said.
"It's something 1 accepted because
I love Stanford and think it is a
great institution. I would like to do
anything I can to make sure that its
possibilities come to fruition."

"This will be an awesome re

I love Stanford and think it is a
great institution. I would like to do
anything I can to make sure that its
possibilities come to fruition."

Future Provost Etchemendy brings a reputation for broad thinking.
"l think we're very, very close to
being the best university in the en
tire world," Philosophy Chair and
newly appointed Provost John
Etchemendy said, "and I think
there's nothing else for us to do
but strive to be that."
Beginning in September,
Etchemendy will take over the
post of chief academic officer from
John Hennessy, who will replace
Gerhard Casper as University
president.
Both Hennessy and Etche
mendy come to their new posi
tions with reputations for broad
interdisciplinary understanding:
Etchemendy was one of the found
ing members of the Symbolic Sys
tems Program, which combines as
pects of computer science, psy
chology, linguistics and philoso
phy, and Hennessy was a key fig
ure in the foundation of the wide
ranging Bio-X Program.
Breadth is a recurring feature
of Etchemendy's career, which
spans what I lennessy jokingly calls
Stanford's "uncrossable divide,"
the boundary between "techie"
and "fuzzy."
"I think he brings a wonderful
perspective on the humanities,"
Hennessy said of his successor,
"but — just as important — an
ability to talk broadly to his col
leagues across the institution."
In addition to his philosophical
publications, Etchemendy co-au
thored with the late logician Jon
Barwise popular educational soft
ware such as "Turing's World,"
"Tarski's World" and "Hyper

proof." He served both as senior
associate dean in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences and as
founding leader of the presiden
tial Commission on Technology in
Teaching and Learning.
As philosophy chair, Etche
mendy helped expand the depart
ment's focus to emphasize both
the technical and humanistic sides
of the subject. "He's been an out
standing chair of philosophy and
helped lead philosophy to a new
level," 1 lennessy said.
The department had traditional
ly aligned itself more with math and
the sciences than the humanities,
but after it lost nearly half its faculty
in a burst of departures several years
ago, Etchemendy helped point the
department in a more balanced di
rection. It is now not only larger
than it was in the early '90s and, in
his words, "just as strong on the sci
ence and logic side, but also has
great strength in history, ethics and
political philosophy."
"1 think the philosophy depart
ment is a very important part of
the University," Etchemendy said,
"because of its ties to so many dif
ferent disciplines."
One of Stanford's greatest assets,
in Etchemendy's view, is its potential
to excel across such a wide range of
activities, from science and electrical
engineering to music composition
and the humanities. "You don't find
it at Ml 112, you don't find it at Har
vard," he said. "We cover a spec
trum that you don't find elsewhere."
As provost, Etchemendy will
have control over the academic
budget and will be responsible lot
decisions about appointments and
promotions of faculty and, by ex

tension, for the expansion or
diminution of schools and depart
ments. Provosts decide when a
school should be given "billets," or
empty positions for new faculty to
fill.
In response to worries that the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences' budgetary problems might
impede the school's ability to at
tract and retain faculty,
Etchemendy said, "I think that the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences has a difficult budget situa
tion, but I don't think it has ever
had trouble attracting or retaining
faculty. . . . There's the financial
problem, but I don't think it's yel
had any impact on our recruit
ment and retention."
Born in Reno, New,
Etchemendy received his bache
lor's and master's degrees from
the University of Nevada, Reno.
After earning his doctorate at
Stanford, he taught at Princeton,
first as lecturer from 1981 to 1982
and then as assistant professor
from 1982 to 1983. I le has been a
faculty member in the Depart
ment of Philosophy since 1983.
In 1992, Etchemendy became
the first recipient of the Bing
Teaching Award, which cited him
for"the most extraordinarily posi
tive testimony from students." I le
has also been a freshman advisor.
"I'm hoping that I'll eventually
be able to teach at least a course a
year," he said, though he will not
be teaching next year. "As I len
nessy has often said, the best job at
tin' University is being a professor,
not president or provost. Especial
ly if you like to teach, and I like to
teach a lot."

Until very recently,
Etchemendy had no intention of
serving in university administra
tion. "It's a funny thing, that uni
versities are administered by facul
ty. Faculty decide to go into their
profession . . . because they like
their profession, not because they
want to run a large organization."
Etchemendy's perspective
began to change during his tenure
as deputy chair on the committee
that nominated Hennessy to be
president. Drawing a parallel be
tween his own decision and that of
ex-Provost Condoleezza Rice, who
similarly served on the committee
that nominated Casper before ac
cepting the post of provost,
Etchemendy said, "There's an in
teresting fact about spending five

months researching higher educa
tion, thinking about Stanford, try
ing to find the best person con
cerned about the future of the
University.
"You suddenly come to realize
how important university leader
ship really is. And I think that has
a big effect on people. It certainly
had a big effect on me . . . Had it
been a year ago, maybe 1 would
have said, 'I don't want to do that,
1 want to stay in the Philosophy
Department.'
"This will be an awesome re
sponsibility," Etchemendy said.
"It's something 1 accepted because
I love Stanford and think it is a
great institution. I would like to do
anything I can to make sure that its
possibilities come to fruition."
