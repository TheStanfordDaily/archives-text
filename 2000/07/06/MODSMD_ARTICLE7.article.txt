### HELEN KWAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Jeffrey Alan YVillick, a caring,
conscientious and original thinker
and teacher in the Physics Depart
ment, was killed on June 18 when a
red MustangCÂ»Tcrashed through a
glass window at a Starbucks coffee
shop in Englewood, New Jersey.
Willick was sitting alone with his
laptop, catching up on work when
the Mustang driver, Joseph A.
Santiglia, 53, lost control of his car in
the Starbucks parking lot. and
crashed into the coffee shop.
Santiglia emerged uninjured, but
Willick was pinned against the grille
of the car. 1 le was pronounced dead
after the Englewood Ambulance

Squad took him to Hackensack
University Medical Center.
Professor Willick had traveled
to New Jersey for Father's Day to
be with his father, Martin S.
Willick of Teaneck, N. Ja promi
nent psychiatrist and lecturer at
Columbia University.
Roger Komani, an associate pro
lessor of physics, said of Willick,
"I lis work,characterized by uncom
promising attention to detail, was
receiving wide attention in the cos
mology community. I fe was very
excited about the ongoing revolu
tion in cosmology and the contribu
tions that his group was making.
Even more fundamental results
were expected as he worked with
the Hobby-Eberly telescope and

other modern instruments.
"To his students, he was a dy
namic and compassionate mentor.
To his colleagues, he was a source of
clear and original thinking on fun
damental problems.
"This is a great loss," Komani
said, "to astrophysics in general
and the Stanford community in
particular."
Willick published 21 scientific ar
ticles during his time at Stanford,
and in 1998 won both a Cornell
Scholarship and a Terman Fellow
ship for his work in observational
cosmology. His primary research
interests were cosmology and the
formation of structure in the uni
verse.
The fundamental nature of

Willick's concerns is evident on his
research Web site. "Is the universe
flat?" it asks. "Is there a nonzero cos
mological constant? Did structure
in the contemporary universe
emerge from the very nearh uni
form primordial distribution of
matter soleh via the process of grav
itational instability? What is the na
ture of 'dark matter," believed to
constitute 90 percent of the total
mass of the universe?"
Born Oct. 8, 1959. Willick grad
uated magna cum laude from Har
vard in 1981, where he received
bachelor's degrees in chemist r\ and
physics and was elected into the Phi
Beta kappa honors s<x iet\ during


The Stanford News Service
"A great loss to astrophysics and the
Stanford community."
