### HELEN KWAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Jeffrey Alan YVillick, a caring,
conscientious and original thinker
and teacher in the Physics Depart
ment, was killed on June 18 when a
red MustangCÂ»Tcrashed through a
glass window at a Starbucks coffee
shop in Englewood, New Jersey.
Willick was sitting alone with his
laptop, catching up on work when
the Mustang driver, Joseph A.
Santiglia, 53, lost control of his car in
the Starbucks parking lot. and
crashed into the coffee shop.
Santiglia emerged uninjured, but
Willick was pinned against the grille
of the car. 1 le was pronounced dead
after the Englewood Ambulance

Squad took him to Hackensack
University Medical Center.
Professor Willick had traveled
to New Jersey for Father's Day to
be with his father, Martin S.
Willick of Teaneck, N. Ja promi
nent psychiatrist and lecturer at
Columbia University.
Roger Komani, an associate pro
lessor of physics, said of Willick,
"I lis work,characterized by uncom
promising attention to detail, was
receiving wide attention in the cos
mology community. I fe was very
excited about the ongoing revolu
tion in cosmology and the contribu
tions that his group was making.
Even more fundamental results
were expected as he worked with
the Hobby-Eberly telescope and

other modern instruments.
"To his students, he was a dy
namic and compassionate mentor.
To his colleagues, he was a source of
clear and original thinking on fun
damental problems.
"This is a great loss," Komani
said, "to astrophysics in general
and the Stanford community in
particular."
Willick published 21 scientific ar
ticles during his time at Stanford,
and in 1998 won both a Cornell
Scholarship and a Terman Fellow
ship for his work in observational
cosmology. His primary research
interests were cosmology and the
formation of structure in the uni
verse.
The fundamental nature of

Willick's concerns is evident on his
research Web site. "Is the universe
flat?" it asks. "Is there a nonzero cos
mological constant? Did structure
in the contemporary universe
emerge from the very nearh uni
form primordial distribution of
matter soleh via the process of grav
itational instability? What is the na
ture of 'dark matter," believed to
constitute 90 percent of the total
mass of the universe?"

his junior year.
After receiving his master's in
physics from UG-Berkeley in 1983,
Willick taught physics at Dwight
Englewood High School in New
Jersey. In 1991, he finished his doc
toral training and was offered a
Hubble Postdoctoral Fellowship,
which he declined. Instead, Willick
became a Fullam/Dudley postdoc
toral fellow in astronomy at the
Carnegie Observatories in Pasade
na. He arrived at Stanford as an as
sistant professor in 1995.
John Higgins, assistant prosecu
tor for the Bergen County Prosecu
tor's Office in New Jersey, said that
the Englewtxxl police issued a sum
mons accusing Santiglia of intoxi
cated driving, though police did not
detect the odor of alcohol at the
time of the accident. Test results for
alcohol or drugs are pending.

Santiglia claims that the crash re
sulted from mechanical failure.
Physics Department Chair Steve
Chu said, "Jeff was a caring and con
scientious classroom teacher.
... He was particularly committed
to involving undergraduates in re
search." According to Chu, Willick
sponsored half a dozen undergrad
uates in independent research and
honors thesis projects.
"He was also well respected and
liked by his graduate students,"
Chu said. "His research . . . was
adding substantial contributions
to the field due to his careful
analysis."
Willick is survived by his wife,
Ellen, and children, Jason and
Emily. A memorial service will be
held on Sunday, July 9 at noon at
Congregation Beth Am., 26790
Arastradero Road, Los Altos
Hills. To make a donation to the
