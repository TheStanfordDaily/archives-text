"When i first arrived, I thought the size and com
plexity of Stanford would be overwhelming. But once
1 discovered the many great people, it all became
quite manageable," said Dean of Admissions and Fi
nancial Aid Robert Kinnally.
And after only three short years, Kinnally is
preparing to leave. At the end of August, he will enter
St. John's Fisher Seminary in Stamford, Conn, to
begin his studies toward ordination as a priest of the
Roman Catholic Church.
What remains unknown is who will replace him in
the fall.
"As I understand it they [Vice Provost for Student
Affairs James Montoya and Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education John Bravman, the Chairs of the
Committee] are very close to deciding on a Dean of
Admissions, but have not yet made a decision," said
Kinnally.
Regardless of who will replace him, Kinnally is
confident that he is "leavingbehind a good legacy." In
fact, in his short time here at Stanford, he has
achieved many accomplishments at the University.
One of those accomplishments have been redevel
oping the financial aid package.
"We made great strides in financial aid including
major policy changes to benefit students and families.
Among them, an overhaul of the outside scholarship
award policy, which is now one of the most generous
in the country. It allows students who bring in outside
scholarship moneys to — in some cases — drastically
reduce or eliminate the self-help (loan and job) por
tion of their financial aid package," said Kinnally.
"The old policy for financial aid was that we would
only reduce the self help portion of the package by

half. So if you had a $10,000 scholarship and $6,000
in self help, your self help would he reduced by
$3,000 leaving you with $7,000 left which would re
place your University scholarship by $7,000," said
Kinnally.
"Why? Because you cannot over award a student.
The idea is that we don't want to give a student more
money than they actually need."
The admissions office have also developed a more
streamlined application process.
"I believe we have streamlined things and at the
same time ensured that every candidate receives a
thorough, careful and thoughtful read," said Kinnal

admissions generally look at the
transcript first and then essays,
while test scores and letters of rec
ommendations are mixed in
later.
"One important thing that we
do in admissions is contextualize a
student's application. We are al
wavs asking what does it mean to
be .1 student at your school and
your area," said Kinnally.
According to Kinnally, Stan
ford is continuously striving for di
versity. Diversity not only in the
academic sense, but also racially
and ethnically.
"We remain firmly committed
to affirmative action. All things
being equal. . . when you practice
affirmative action you are demon
strating an appreciation for differ
ent viewpoints and an under
standing of how those different
views provide intellectual stimula
tion," said Kinnally.
"One of the perks of being
Dean of Admissions is that I get to
select the most diverse students
from the best application pool in
the country. The students at Stan
ford are absolutely inspiring," said
Kinnally.
To keep students creative, the
admissions office is bringing back
the picture question as an essay
topic for next year. The change
has a lot to do with giving students
more freedom in writing their
essay.
"The picture question is more
open-ended and gives applicants
endless possibilities for their
essay," said Kinnally.
When asked what advice he has
for his replacement, Kinnally jok
ingly replied "make sure to get
your (iaieties lines memorized re
ally early."
"More seriously, though, 1
would say it's important to con
nect with students bv going to
their dorms and having dinner
with them. It's really important to
keep open lines of communication
with these future leaders," said
Kinnally.
But even with all of Stanford's
intellectual prowess and wonder
ful resources, Kinnally believes
that he had a "higher calling."
" There was something else that
I felt 1 had to do. And it's one of
those things that you don't ques
tion too much." said Kinnally.
"1 have friends here and have
enjoyed meeting and interacting
with everyone. I will definitely
miss Stanford," he said.
