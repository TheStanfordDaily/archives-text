"When i first arrived, I thought the size and com
plexity of Stanford would be overwhelming. But once
1 discovered the many great people, it all became
quite manageable," said Dean of Admissions and Fi
nancial Aid Robert Kinnally.
And after only three short years, Kinnally is
preparing to leave. At the end of August, he will enter
St. John's Fisher Seminary in Stamford, Conn, to
begin his studies toward ordination as a priest of the
Roman Catholic Church.
What remains unknown is who will replace him in
the fall.
"As I understand it they [Vice Provost for Student
Affairs James Montoya and Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education John Bravman, the Chairs of the
Committee] are very close to deciding on a Dean of
Admissions, but have not yet made a decision," said
Kinnally.
Regardless of who will replace him, Kinnally is
confident that he is "leavingbehind a good legacy." In
fact, in his short time here at Stanford, he has
achieved many accomplishments at the University.
One of those accomplishments have been redevel
oping the financial aid package.
"We made great strides in financial aid including
major policy changes to benefit students and families.
Among them, an overhaul of the outside scholarship
award policy, which is now one of the most generous
in the country. It allows students who bring in outside
scholarship moneys to — in some cases — drastically
reduce or eliminate the self-help (loan and job) por
tion of their financial aid package," said Kinnally.
"The old policy for financial aid was that we would
only reduce the self help portion of the package by

half. So if you had a $10,000 scholarship and $6,000
in self help, your self help would he reduced by
$3,000 leaving you with $7,000 left which would re
place your University scholarship by $7,000," said
Kinnally.
"Why? Because you cannot over award a student.
The idea is that we don't want to give a student more
money than they actually need."
The admissions office have also developed a more
streamlined application process.
"I believe we have streamlined things and at the
same time ensured that every candidate receives a
thorough, careful and thoughtful read," said Kinnal
