# Summer housing crisis averted
## 
### GREG BRAZEAL EDITORIAL STAFF 
Despite the initial threat ofa housing crunch for un
dergraduates, Stanford's Housing and Dining Ser
vices succeeded in offering a spot to every student wh<)
requested on-campus housing this summer. With
walk-in housing assignment set to end July 7, there are
still about 35 vacancies, according to Housing Assign
ment Services Manager! "odd Benson.
Emphasizing the unprecedented demand for
housing at the beginning of die summer, Benson said,
"Initially we had 330 people unhoused, versus 90 a
year ago." But on May 31 the University opened up
about 150 additional spaces for undergraduates in
Roth, 592 Mayfield and the C-Wing of Roble, in addi
tion to the roughly 600 undergraduate spots already
available in Florence M(x>re and Mirrielees.
"We know that we got everyone housed who want
ed to get housed," Benson said.

To avoid the housing situation some students have opted to
live on the roof of Chi Theta Chi.
In the past, an average 200 sum
mer conferences and camps have
been housed on campus, bringing in
$6 million in 1998. A survey conduct
ed in 1993 found that if campus dor
mitories remained empty in the sum
mer, r(x>m and board expenses for
students would be 13 percent higher.
"1 would say that our total sum
mer income was not impacted by the
additional housing provided for the
students," said Conference Services
Manager Carol Leynse.
Several conference groups' hous
ing arrangements changed as a re
sult of the expanded undergraduate
offerings, often after the groups had
published the information. "We had
to move several groups into alter
nate locations to provide additional
space for Stanford undergrads,"
Leynse said. "One group we had to
ask to split their housing into two

separate locations."
The increased demand for cam
pus housing was triggered by sky
rocketing housing costs in the Bay
Area. ()ff campus, students compete
against renters able to accept longer
leases at higher prices. In order to
secure a place to live, "some people
lie about how long they're staying,"
said senior Sarah Fessenden, who is
currently sharing the floor of her
friend's boyfriend's apartment in
Palo Alto with her friend's
boyfriend's roommate.
Eight to 10 weeks of undergradu
ate housing on campus during the
summer generally costs around
$1,000, but students living in Flo
rence Moore and Roble are required
to purchase meal plans, which start at
$859 for 10 meals a week for eight
weeks.
Though Housing and Dining
has received no complaints, some
students found the $10.75 meals
prohibitively expensive and chose
not to accept assignment to Florence
Moore or Roble, instead seeking
housing through other means.

Some have chosen to sublet campus
housing without University autho
rization, an offense that can lead to
heavy fines and even loss of housing
privileges.
Roth, 592 Mayfield and Roble C-
Wing were selected for the addition
al undergraduate housing because
they were "the easiest to open up
without creating additional compli
cations," Benson said. "It had to do
with where the conferences could !*•
moved from."
A thick, makeshift wall was con
structed between C-YVing and the
rest of Roble. "That's something
that's been done in the past," Benson
said. "There are summer confer
ences in Roble, and we want to make
sure... there aren't conflicts or any
thing like that."
As a result, students living in
Roble (l-Wing do not have access to
cooking, laundry or computer facil
ities within their building. In order
to wash their clothing, they must
carry it to Florence Moore. Housing
Assignment Services has received no
complaints.
