### GREG BRAZEAL EDITORIAL STAFF 
Despite the initial threat ofa housing crunch for un
dergraduates, Stanford's Housing and Dining Ser
vices succeeded in offering a spot to every student wh<)
requested on-campus housing this summer. With
walk-in housing assignment set to end July 7, there are
still about 35 vacancies, according to Housing Assign
ment Services Manager! "odd Benson.
Emphasizing the unprecedented demand for
housing at the beginning of die summer, Benson said,
"Initially we had 330 people unhoused, versus 90 a
year ago." But on May 31 the University opened up
about 150 additional spaces for undergraduates in
Roth, 592 Mayfield and the C-Wing of Roble, in addi
tion to the roughly 600 undergraduate spots already
available in Florence M(x>re and Mirrielees.
"We know that we got everyone housed who want
ed to get housed," Benson said.

To avoid the housing situation some students have opted to
live on the roof of Chi Theta Chi.
