# Donald Kennedy editing Science

"I think it's probably the steepest learning curve I've
been on in about 25 years," president emeritus of Stan
ford and editor in c hief of Science magazine Donald
Kennedy said. "It's a complicated business getting out a
large journal every week with lots of different features
and complicated and interesting sets of relationships
with the scientific community."
Since June I, Kennedy has served as the editor in
chief of Science, the weekly peer-reviewed journal of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science
(AAAS).
"I've actually spent a significant amount of my time
preparing in various ways on the publication of the data
on the human genome, which is coming up this fall, and
will be a major call on our staff resources and capabili
ties," Kennedy said.
Two scientific teams announced in J une that they had
finished the first rough draft of the human genetic code.
The genome, which directs the actions of every living
cell, is the entire expanse of I)NA.
Kennedy is the Hing Professor of Environmental Sci
ence and co-director of the Center for Environmental
Science and Policy. He was commissioner of the F<xxl
and Drug administration in the Carter Administration.
"I've had several different jobs in my life and I've en
joyed them all. I've always enjoyed the transitions," said
Kennedy when asked about his experiences. "Certainly
the role that I was in the longest and the most varied time
was my role as a teacher. If I had to name a favorite role,
that would be it."
Kennedy is deeply concerned with ecology and envi
ronmental policy. He expressed his views on the role of
science and humanity in nature.
"I think the human future is asking more of science
now rather than less," Kennedy noted. "I think that
we're at an especially critical peri<xl with respect to the
kinds of problems posed by the pace of global change. By
that I mean not only climate change, which ought to be
getting more attention than it is, but also the depletion of
natural resources, stocks, changes in land cover and land
use," he said.
Kennedy's research program consists of interdiscipli
nary studies on development of policies regarding such

trans-bound
ary environ
mental prob
lems. It is
co nducted
partially
through the
Institute of
International
Studies.
"These
challenges —
all of them —
need lots of
scientific at
tention both
to estimate
their scope
and also to
develop sen
sible solu
tions. 1 didn't
come to Sci
ence maga
zine with the
idea that 1
was going to
change con-

tent in any dramatic way. But certainly we need to pay
careful attention to the kinds of science that are both nec
essary to get letter estimates of what is happening to the
conditions for life on this planet and also design some
ways ol improving its quality," said Kennedy.
