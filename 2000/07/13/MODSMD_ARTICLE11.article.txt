## DAILY VIEWPOINT All I needed to know, I learned in my internship 
### MEREDITH ROWE STAFF COLUMNIST 
Surely, it'll get better.
This is what I tell myself to remain sane
every time I crouch on the floor in the law of
fice, all dressed up with no one but the near
by copy machine to impress, YVindex in one
hand and a raggedy old towel soaked with
spilled milk in the other.
Then, 1 proceed to tap a tray that holds a
strange murky liquid, the results of last
night's defrosting of the refrigerator I'm
cleaning. The tray is a thin white plastic con
traption. precariously balancing on side rail
ings beneath the miniature freezer. It would
be easiest, of course, to remove the tray and
dump it in the sink, but no, no, today I'm not
that lucky. It won't budge because the refrig
erator door can open no wider: there's a
pesky wall in the way.
So I tap at it until all of the liquid drips to
the refrigerator's base below. Then I soak it
up with a pile of towels, and start the next job:
scrubbing away the fridge's soda stains that
have probably existed since before I was born
in 1980.
This summer I'm a "web designer" for a
law firm in mv Texas hometown. This is ap

parently a secret code for "girl who cleans re
frigerators, takes out the trash, hunts for
missing files that are in some mysterious lost
lile-fblder-land and begs the copy machine to
just please collate a stack of papers, or even
just successfully copy them."
Yes, it is every bit as glamorous as it
sounds.
Then, at 1 p.m., I head off to my second
job: I'm an intern at a local community news
paper. Yes, I am a girl of many trades. There,
1 write feature stories and take the occasional
photograph, which I enjoy very much. The
problem here is that 1 spend half of the time
staring at the ceiling, counting the number of
llorescent lights in the room because I simply
don't have enough to do.
Last summer was spent at yet another
newspaper, writing obituaries, typing up
columns with tidbits about what Betty Jo
wore to last week's high school reunion and
authoring articles about fire ant control. I
learned a lot of things that summer, but
there's one fact that seems to stick out before
all others: fire ants are more likely to raid
your home in the summer when it's hotter.
So it hit pretty close to home when I read
a piece in The New York Times the other day
that suggested internships and summer jobs

are becoming, shall we say, less popular
among college students.
It said this is due to a few things: lots of eco
nomic prosperity, time spent in summer
school and the tact that students are finding in
terchips to be pretty unfulfilling on the whole.
At first I skipped around, raving about
how true it was. If ever any words were writ
ten with me in mind, these were it. Finally,
someone not only understood but agreed
with my frustration.
I kept thinking. I thought about refrig
erators, typesetting and writing silly feature
articles.
This is not unfulfilling. Unfulfilling would
be lying around at home watching television.
My aforementioned stints as a "web de
signer" and newspaper intern are not terri
bly high-paying, fast-paced or particularly
challenging. But that's not what's important.
1 work with wonderful, friendly people who
remember my birthday, thank me for help
ing them and ask me how I'm doing when I
walk through the front door.
I'm 20 years old and I've never had a real
ly cushy job. Sometimes I complain about
this, thinking of my friends who are lab assis
tants â€” researching fascinating ideas that
might end up having something to do with

their thesis and making a lot of money while
doing so.
But I've had so many varied experiences.
There's nothing better than hearing back
from a little boy you interviewed about his bi
cycle hobby for a feature story. Sure, the story
won't win a Pulitzer and it won't be remem
bered by the general public for more than a
few hours at most. But it sure made that little
boy's day, and I think that's about as fulfilling
as a summer job can get.
All you can do is take the good with the
bad and hope maybe you'll come out better
for it. Someday, i hope, I'll be able to re
member these "internships" and laugh, or at
least remember that when I wasn't paying at
tention, they taught me about life in their
own ways.
And, thankfully, there are only so many
refrigerators that can possibly need cleaning,
so many fire ants that need to be controlled
and so many files to find.
It's getting better already.

would also like to say hello to her roommate Sahri
