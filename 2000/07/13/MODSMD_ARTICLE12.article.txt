# DAILY VIEWPOINT
## Move in, start up, and move on 
### DANA MULHAUSER STAFF COLUMNIST 
Silicon Valley is the land of rapid
mobility. Mosdy upward, but also
downward, lateral and diagonal.
The right job at an up-and-com
ing startup will lead to the job at
Homestead or Google that will lead
to the job at Sun or Netscape or
even, God forbid, Microsoft. It
doesn't stop until you have a Gulf
stream and a personal masseuse.
Every job is a way station for the big
ger and better stop that comes next.
And Stanford is at the epicenter
of it. Heck, if you start at Stanford,
you can usually skip a few rungs up
the ladder — thanks to summer in
ternships and a recommendation
letter from Gomputer Science Prof.
Eric Roberts — and be that much
closer to the next, sought-after job.
In the computer world, three
years puts you near the top of your
company in mobility. Anything
longer than that and people start to
question your capability for ad
vancement.
Mobility-mania is the essence of
Silicon Valley, and what the Valley
does, Stanford does. Not just in its
Gomputer Science Department but
in its administration as well. Here at

Stanford, everyone is movin' on i.p.
In the last two years, the deans
from six of the seven schools have
left, in addition to the president and
the provost. Some have taken high
er jobs, some have gone back to
teaching, some are now advising
presidential candidates. Dean of
Earth Sciences Eranklin Orr must
feel like the last man standing at a
Grateful Dead concert.
It's not just the academic deans:
the chairman of the Board of
Trustees, the head of the Stanford
Management Company, the direc
tor of SLAG, the dean for religious
life and the dean of admissions. Is
there something in the water?
Almost none of the people who
ran this University just two years
ago are still at the helm today. It
seems like Stanford has become just
another Silicon Valley startup;
everyone wants to be somewhere
else.
To give you some perspective,
the love-em-and-leave-em system is
not how most major universities
work. For example, when the new
Harvard president takes over in the
spring, the deans of his business
school, law school, school of arts and
sciences and sch<x>l of education
will each have at least five years ex

perience at their present jobs, and
the provost will have been around
for four years. The same positions
in Stanford's administration have
four years experience combined.
Yes, academia overall is more fluid
than it was 40 years ago; every in
dustry is. But Stanford, ever the pi
oneer, is leading the pack.
Why should we mind? Alter all,
the system works well for the tech
companies in the area. New blood
means new ideas. Ambitious em
ployees mean ambitious projects,
growth and expansion.
We should mind because Stan
lord is not just another dot-com on
the rise, and rules that work for the
computer industry aren't always
the best solutions here.
Don't get me wrong, turnover
at the top has its advantages. It
gave Stanford its first female aca
demic dean, Law School chief
Kathleen Sullivan. Some schools
with tumultuous recent histories,
like Humanities and Sciences,
used the changeover to make a
fresh start.
But starting over from scratch
has disadvantages that can't be
overlooked. It takes a few years to
become efficient at a new job — to
learn the people and the system and

the responsibilities. While Hen
nessy's first year as provost was ef
fective, I presume his second would
have been much more so.
Part of learning a new job is pick
ing up tips from your colleagues,
but what happens when your col
leagues are as new as you are? How
is the president's cabinet supposed
to work effectively together when
they've been a team for about five
minutes?
Lack of experience and of insti
tutional memory can doom Stan
ford into repeating some of its not
too-far-distant mistakes.
What happens next time there's
a budget crunch and no one in
charge had a close-up view of
Condi's swashbuckling cost-cutting
maneuvers? Will administrators

who didn't face the poignant rally of
graduate students with no housing
respond appropriately to the next
housing crisis?
The best solution, as we know
from Aristode, lies in balance. Fresh
faces are good, but so are grizzled
veterans. New approaches are
needed, but so are time-tested ones.
hope these new appointees
both bring with them new ideas and
stick around long enough to see
them through.
After all, it wouldn't do to be too
much like a startup; we wouldn't
want Hennessy and Etchemendy
working out of cubicles, would we?
