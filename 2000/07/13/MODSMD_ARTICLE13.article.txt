## Tracksters prepare to go on (Olympic) trial 
### BEN ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
I'he ()lvmpic I rials lor track and
field begin in Sacramento today,
and Stanford will be well represent
ed on both the track and field tionts.
flie men, coming off an NCAA
championship season, will send
seven Cardinal representatives to
the ()1\ mpic hunt while the women
send four.
The top three athletes in each
event will advance to Sydney, as
suming they have met Olympic
qualifying standards. The following
rundown encapsulates the quest for
Olympic glory among Stanford
track and field athletes this year:
Brad Hauser — Senior, long
distances. Having just graduated
from the Cardinal distance corps,
Brad 1 fauser is probably the Cardi
nal men's best shot to qualify for the
Olympics. His 28 minute, 8.02 sec
ond clocking last year at 10,000 me
ters gives him the Olympic 'A' stan
dard. and his second place finish at
the U.S. Championships last year at
the same distance shows he's right
in the mix. Brad won both the
5,000 and 10,000 meters at the
NCAA championship meet this
year, and he appears to be in the
best shape of his life. Because
Hauser's 10,000 meter final is
tonight, look for him to double
back in the 5,000 meter run — its
preliminary heat is Monday.
Brent Hauser — Senior, long
distances. Brad's twin brother Brent
is right on his heels in both the 5,000
and 10,000 meters. Brent ran
28:23.37 this year, the fastest time of
any collegian, and is also a threat at
5,000 meters.
Jason Balkman — Senior, long
distances. A seasoned veteran of the
distances, Balkman has been among

the nation's top 10,000 meter run
ners for the past couple of years. Fin
ishing in the top three in the NCAA
at 10,000 meters the last two years,
Balkman's ability to cover moves in
the middle of the race keeps him
right with the chase pack, ffhe'swith
the leaders with 1.000 meters to go,
he has an excellent shot to make the
team. Both he and Brent would
need to break 28:10.00 before the
Games, however, to validate their
top spots.
Michael Stember—Junior,
middle distances. Stember is among
the nation's top handful of middle
distance runners and is among only
seven runners qualified in both the
1,500 and 800 meter runs. His kick
is feared among the 1,500 meter
crowd — he placed fourth in the
United States last year and was sec
ond to teammate Gabe Jennings
both indoors and outdoors at that
distance this year. After hitting the
Olympic 'A' standard of 1:46.20 at
the NCAA championship in the 800
meters this year, he has decided to
try for the Olympic team in both
events.
Gabe Jennings — Sophomore,
1,500 meters. Jennings' time of
3:37.33 was the fastest in the nation
this year. He may be as much of a
threat to make the team as Brad
Hauser, though a tight hamstring
kept him out of the CMC Envoy
()pen two weeks ago.
Jonathon Riley — Sophomore,
5,000 meters. Though equally profi
cient at the mile and the 5,000 me
ters, Riley has elected to race the
longer distance at the Trials. His
3:38.90 clocking at 112 ,500 meters last
week, however, showed that his
speed has not left him — a worry
some entertained after his extreme
ly long string of collegiate competi
tions this year. His 13:36.69 clocking

last year places him among the na
tion's top 15 runners, and his fero
cious kick makes him deadly in
championship-style races.
Toby Stevenson — Senior, Pole
Vault. Consistently at the very top of
the collegiate ranks in the pole vault,
Stevenson currently ranks 10th in
the United States at his event. He is
a clutch performer, scoring many of
his best marks in championship
competition.
Kathleen Donaghue — Fresh
man, Pole Vault. Just 18 years old,
Donaghue will compete for an elu
sive spot on the U.S. team in the
Games' youngest event, the
women's pole vault. Her personal
best of 13 feet, 1/4 inches is impres
sive, but the ()lympic 'B' standard of
13-9 1/2 will be tough to grab.
Summer Pierson — Senior, Dis
cus. One of Stanford's all-time best
throwers, Pierson was ranked No. 2
in the NCAA for much of the year.
She is hoping to bounce back from a
disappointing NCAA meet in which
she did not score.
Sally Glynn —Junior, Distances.
This year marked a number of
breakthroughs for Glynn. After dip
ping under 16:00 in the 5,000 me
ters earlier this year, she looked like
a lock for that race in the Trials. But
after her 4:12.65 in the 1,500 meters
in the CMC meet, Glynn could also
opt for the shorter distance.
Lauren Fleshman — Freshman,
5,000 meters. Stanford's youngest
Olympic contender, Fleshman was
also Stanford's top runner for much
of the track season. Her 15:50.18 is
No. 3 all-time for Stanford, and her
fourth-place showing in the NCAA
meet at 1,500 meters (4:17.76)
shows that her speed is not lacking.
She could be a surprise contender
for a spot on the team headed to
Australia.
