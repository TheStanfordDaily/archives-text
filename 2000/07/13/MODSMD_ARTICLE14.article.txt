kills and added eight digs as the Americans
ended a four-match series against Olympic
host Australia with a 25-19,25-12,25-19 vic-

Tory to sweep the series. Team USA did not
drop a set in the four matches.
Heather Bown also had 11 kills and seven
blocks for Team USA Libero Stacy Sykora
paced the defense with 15 digs.

went on a three-point run in the first game,
capitalizing on an Australian missed serve
and kills by Sarah Noriega and Mkkisha
Hurley. The Australians came back with
their own three-point run but Team USA
used its experience and size to hold off the
Australian attack.
Hie U.S. Women took advantage of Aus
tralia's slow start in the beginning of the sec
ond game and utilized many short point runs
to defeat Australia. Despite the ap
parent dominance in game two,
Team USA did not play the flawless
game they had wanted.
" 1 )es] )ite the win, we didn't reach
our goal of fewer unforced errors,"
said Bown, a middle-hitter. "We
had good execution, but we need to
work on committing fewer errors."
Head (loach Mick Haley was
pleased with his team's perfor
mance, but this tour also created
new questions yet to be answered.
"This is a good end to a long
tour," Haley said. "We llew here di
rectly from Brazil and a tough four
match series. Many players are tired
or battled illness on tour, yet we suc
ceeded. I am pleased with the Je
suits. It answered many questions
yet it also created many questions."
