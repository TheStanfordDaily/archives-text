# Time to stop the home run madness
## 
### 
Hey, did you see Sammy Sosa hit anoth
er gopher ball out of the yard? What's
that? You didn't?
Well, you'll see his winning performance in
Monday's All-Star Home Run Derby repeated
so many times in the next few days that you'll
want to club Chris Berman with a Louisville
Slugger. BACK BACK BACK BACK
etc . . . ad nauseum, if you know what I mean.
Don't get me wrong, I like seeing home

runs as much as the next
guy (or girl). By my way of
thinking, though, it isn't the
same seeing someone jack
an SO mile per hour fastball
down the middle of the
plate — for most of these
guys, it's the baseball equiv
alent of shooting fish in a
barrel.
Not only that, but consid-

ei a list of some of the winners in tht* derby's
10-year history: Ryne Sandberg, Cal Ripken
and Tino Martinez, none of whom is exactly
known for launching bombs. Anyone who
takes the event as an actual indicator of who
the biggest bopper is should be sentenced to
watch the god-awful Devil Rays lor a whole
season.
The sad thing is, it's gotten to the point
where most people care more about who wins
the Home Run sit-back-and-slugfest than who
wins the actual game itself.
Everyone has always liked seeing guys blast
it out of the park. But since 1998 and the Mark
McGwire Show (and really, before that even),
the baseball marketing wizards have decided
that, well, geez, we'll get richer off ads and

merchandise if we just give people what they
want — slow pitch softball games!
ESPN, spurred on by popular interest, even
revived an old show called Home Run Chal
lenge, which is nothing more than a carbon
copy of the All-Star home run spectacle with 10
percent of the crowd, 100 percent of the hyper
announcers and 0 percent ol the excitement.
As we all know, there can be too much of a
good thing. Beyond the made-for-television
theatrics, the emphasis on home runs has
completely altered the landscape of the game.
The American League is a haven for sluggers
like Jose Canseco, Vinny Castilla and many
more — guys who are good lot a bum h of big
blasts and not much else in the way of defense,
base hits and athleticism, as anyone who has
watched baseball tor the last 10 years can tell.
You can thank expansion-diluted pitching,
stronger hitters and smaller ballparks for that.
for the casual, watch-a-game-once-in-a
blue-moon fan, watching lots of homers is
probably all they need to see. But for more
hard-core fans such as myself, it gets a little
old. Once you've gotten to the point where 10-
9 scores are commonplace, it becomes a ne
cessity to make changes. As much as 1 hate to
say it, I'm shocked now when I see a score like
2-1 or even 4-3.
I like seeing a sacrifice. 1 like seeing the hit
and-run. I like seeing the runner from first
heading for home on a double in the gap.
And, as strange as it sounds, I like seeing
pitchers hit, because when they hit one out it
truly is special.
These are the things that make the game,
the little intracacies that take years to perfect
and refine. And right now, baseball is in dan

ger of losing them. Kids will see Sammy Sosa
blasting balls on Tuner Field's roof and swing
from their butts everytime in hopes of lofting
one for the fences.
The last thing we need is more people
completely enamored with the home run. So
if you see highlights of Sammy launching balls
at the home run derby, do what I do.
Turn the channel.
