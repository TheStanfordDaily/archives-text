## 'Storm' is a little too wet 
### MONYA DE EDITORIAL STAFF 
"The Perfect Storm" has a lot going for it. It's based
(loosely) on a true story and a bestselling book. It has Dr.
Ross, I mean, George Clooney. It has a digitally en
hanced ocean to pick up the acting slack for the humans.
But put it all together and it doesn't quite deliver. In
this new story of impending doom on the sea, the extra
plots thicken the situation like spilled cornstarch and the
fabrication of an indestructible boat and skipper is a bit
much to swallow.
Clooney's character, Billy, is a fisherman who, is un
derpaid and shafted by the tyrannical owner of his boat.
After sailing back home with a mediocre catch, he de
cides to ride out further into the ocean to a dangerous
spot called the Flemish Gap, legendary for its teeming
schools of fish. He gathers up fellow struggling fisher
men for the grand voyage and sails right into a storm. In
a painfully obvious metaphor, Billy is bringing a storm
into the storm; two of the fishermen hate each other and
heighten the tension on the boat as they engage in in
creasingly vicious skirmishes.
Clooney can't quite shake his ER persona. He's got
the same mannerisms, the same standoffishness. He
seems to be the group's adversary instead of their leader,
and he scares fisherman Bobby (Mark Wahlberg). Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio (from "Robin Hood") plays the
tough female skipper he admires and has a sort of cere
bral romance with.
Despite the ominous beginnings of the recycled
"human stories" that Like up the first half hour of the
movie and fairly drip with saccharine (tally: three sets of
divorced kids, two divorced dad/mom pairs, one pas
sionate young couple with no money, one motherly bar
tender and one bizarre woman who falls for the skanki
est fisherman after he hits on her in the town bar), the
supporting cast manages to retain some individuality.
Wahlberg is solid as Bobby, torn between love for his
girlfriend and the need to make money fishing so he can
support her. The conflict between the two fighting fish
erman is resolved without too much sobbing and hug
ging-
Meanwhile, other situations arise. A sailboat owner
refuses to call for help as the hurricane begins. The ice
machine on the fishing boat breaks, and the men must

scurry back through the storm if they are to sell the thou
sands of pounds offish they have caught. A Coast Guard
helicopter headed for Billy's boat runs out of fuel. Oh,
and a weatherman realizes that the hurricane and an
other storm are about to collide right over Billy's boat.
Well, not really, but close enough.
The movie's strength is in its portrayal of life as a fish
erman. Clooney and friends' enthusiasm for fishing is in
fectious as they haul cute rubber swordfish onto their
boat. However, some of Clooney's dialogue is danger
ously corny. It's Dr. Ross yelling "I'M GONNA C ATCH
A Slin LOAD OF FISH!" at Marky Mark.
Among the movies ripped off in this film are: "Air
Force One," "Titanic," "Armageddon," "Apollo 13" and
a NBC. made for TV movie about a giant squid called
"The Beast."
Fhe true star of the movie is the ocean, of course. The
visuals are cool, there's no doubt about it. You have to go
into this one with a "Matrix" attitude; just ignore the peo
ple in the movie. You will feel you are in the boat in some
scenes. But huge kudos go to the sound effects editors.
They make up for the inanity of cheery music as a Coast
Guardite is about

to die. With the
help of computers
and a lot of cre
ativity the aural
experience is fan
tastic. An extra
sur for that.
