# Not much 'Cheer' here

The John Waters-influenced
"But I'm a Cheerleader" isn't funny
enough to be an all-out satire-come
dy, thoughtful enough to be a criti
cal satire or empathetic enough to
be a drama of" personal crisis. In
stead, there are a few funny (albeit
often lowbrow) moments, a handful
of pointed comments and a couple
of attempts at serious emotion. All in
a plot line which seems to follow
whichever style was being tried at
that moment.
This is too bad, because, at its
core, the plot is an interesting idea.
Megan Bloomfield (Natasha Ly
onne, "American Pie") is a high
school cheerleader with certain
tastes that her family and friends
find suspicious: a vegetarian diet,
Melissa Etheridge and Georgia
O'Keefe, to name a few. And, to
top it all off, she doesn't like kissing
her boyfriend (something the au
dience will sympathize with upon
seeing his technique). But she's a
good Christian girl and a cheer
leader, so the thought that she
might be a lesbian never enters her
mind until an intervention in
which she's told and then swiftly
corralled to a place that will
straighten her out.
C)f course, being forced to share a
nx>m with a bunch of lesbians and
learning the joys of scrubbing floors
and cooking dinner don't seem like
the best way to do this, but that's the
way things are at "True Directions."
At the helm of this institution is the
prissy Mary Brown (Oscar-nomi
nated Cathy Moriary, "Casper") and
former graduate Mike (a goateed
Charles RuPaul, better known in
drag by his surname). The bitchiest

girl of the group (who in this type of
movie is always the supporting char
acter) is Graham ((Ilea DuVall, fresh
from another institutional comedy
drama, "Girl Interrupted").
The film dresses itself in flamboy
ant colors and ridiculous situations.
Stereotypical male/female/gay/les
bian characterizations — along with
fruidess attempts to turn homosexu
als into '50s icons — are also played
for laughs, but all these more often
than not miss their marks. This is
unfortunate because the comic pos
sibilities and serious issues brought
up are fertile ground. They're just
never sufficiently explored.
"But I'm a Cheerleader" strad
dles the line ttx) often. It would have
been Ijetter if it was a pure drama,
pure comedy or pure satire. It
would have been better if Megan
wasn't outed to the audience in the
first act, if she slowly discovered her
sexuality or if she wasn't gay at all. It
would have been better if minor
characters weren't so unbelievably
stereotyped or if those stereotypes
were played up more wickedly. As it
is, the movie takes the middle
ground. To do this successfully
would require insight, drama and
humor, but this movie is short on all
of these.
Still, it's difficult to hate the film,
and some might even enjoy it. It is a
novel and intriguing premise—
what life is really like where good
Christians try to "cure" homosexu
ality for the hetero-wannabies, for
the falsely accused and for those
who just want to be "cured" long
enough to last until college. But it re
mains largely a squandered oppor
tunity in this film. Perhaps some
brave soul with better ideas can
make a sequel. "But I'm a Quarter
back," anyone?
