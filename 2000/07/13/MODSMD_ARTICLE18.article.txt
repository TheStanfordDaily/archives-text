# Slick David Grisman Quartet rocks out at Palookaville
## 
### STEVEN RAPHAEL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For the last 25 years, David Gris
man has been blazing a unique path
for himself through the world of
music. His self-titled "Dawg Music"
is a unique blend of swing, blue
grass, Latin, jazz and gypsy music,
among others.
In many circles, he is best known
for his work with Jerry Garcia and
the Grateful Dead, with whom he
recorded several albums. However,
it is with the David Grisman Quin
tet that he has truly thrived, explor
ing nearly every sound one could
imagine coming from acoustic in
struments. Over the years, musi
cians have come and gone from his
quintet, but what has remained

constant is (he high level of musi
cianship and creativity.
On Friday night, the current
David Grisman Quintet played to
an adoring crowd at Palookaville,
Santa Cruz. Amidst shouts of "We
love you Dave," whistles, cheers
and catcalls, the group cranked out
two, hour-long sets of fun, enter
taining music. Moseying out after
the rest of the band, already playing
the mandolin tied around his neck,
Grisman was quite a picture. One of
the largest men I've seen, his enor
mous girth dwarfed the tiny man
dolin. Behind him, the bass player
was a dead ringer for Jeff Fox wor
thy, the guitarist looked like a Latin
Wayne Newton, the flautist writhed
like a go-go dancer during his solos
and the percussionist was just plain

goofy, dressed like a jester in mis
matched bright colors. If you think
that looked funny, you're right.
But, if you think that this in any way
affected the music, then you're just
wrong. As the group picked their
way through many of Grisman's
classic numbers, including one that
had originally been recorded with
Garcia, the versatility of the band
was amazing.
Guitarist Enrique Coria seam
lessly went from bluegrass flat
picking to sensuous Latin
melodies to pretty classical mus
ings, playing each style as if it was
his life's work. Percussionist Joe
Craven was arguably the most ver
satile member of the group. He
spent most of the night playing
percussion, using various knick

knacks, bongos, and his body to
create rhythms (including one
solo he took by playing his head).
His mouth never stopped moving
as he verbally created authentic
cymbal sounds. He also played a
mean violin and mandolin, and
his mastery of the talking drum
surpasses anything that I've ever
seen before. He actually played
melodies on the drum, trading
licks with Grisman and walking
the bass during one song.
Being familiar only with Gris
man's recordings, I was mildly dis
appointed to notice the amount of
repetition in his playing. Over and
over again he returned to the same
open string, hammer-on and pull
off licks. However, he certainly had
his moments, playing some great

mandolin throughout the show

Overall, the concert was fantas
tic. The incredible variety of music
played kept the audience guessing
all night. One song would be Latin,
the next would be bluegrass and the
next would be jazz. Grisman played
a duet with Craven at one point,
ending in a contest over who could
play the softest note, while at anoth
er time, Coria t(x>k sole possession
of the stage for his classical styling.
Near the end of the show, all five
members began improvising simul
taneously, spurring each other on
ward to find new ways to play their
instruments. Finally, around mid
night, the group adjourned, leaving
the audience pleading for more and
the memory of beautiful music
hanging in the air.
