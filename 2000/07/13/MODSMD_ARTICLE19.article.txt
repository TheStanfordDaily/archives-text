# Jucifer's sound is definitely tart

Rock bands that start from the bottom and work their
way up usually progress in stages. The first stage is usually
the most interesting musically; the band can usually be de
scribed as searching for its defining sound. The group de
velops a following, word of mouth begins to pic k up, fre
quency of performance starts to pic k up and the group can
be noticed by local radio, landing the occasional (and ever
important) on-air promo.
Once that initial spurt gets a group picked up on the
radar, it can then move on to stage two: the first major label
release. Here is where the make-or-break stage occurs. 11
the first album can tly when released broadly, then the band
has a shot. If not, then at best they can hope for the title of
one-hit wonders. Remember 311? At the moment, you are
more likely to find their logo around before you'll hear
them. What about A-Ha? I'll give you a nice shiny quarter if
you tan name a song on the 1 (),()()() Maniacs album that fol
lowed the Unplugged one. Ace of Base, anyone ... I think
you get the idea.
But, every now and then, there are bands that somehow,
some way, do it. They make it to the third level. They have a
sound, they have a lasting ability that somehow defies logic.
The Roots, Bad Religion, Belly and Beck all had to start
somewhere and each with a sound that attracted enough at
tention from an audience that would make them stick.
Jucifer is a band that can make it to the third level. "Call
ing All Cars on the Vegas Strip" is quite possibly the album
that can get them there, even though it is merely a re-mas
tering of their original independent release. The Athens,
Georgia natives are really just a duo but transcend their size
with sound. Bassist G.Amber Valentine and her boyfriend,
drummer Edgar Livengood, bring a sound that suggests
what Hole was going to be before Courtney went legit along
with the song-writing abilities that Billy Corgan had before
his head got too large. Her vocals range from a purring,
subtle malevolence to a genuine rock scream. It's a one
woman show in that respect.

The album isn't perfect,
but it shows what Jucifer
is capable of doing.
"Code Escovedo" is a
slow and breathy growl of
a song but suffers from
Livengood's drum work,
which could use more re-

fining. Valentine's bass skills are much better, and she rocks
hard throughout the album. "Malibu" is a track that comple
ments the couple well. The drum beats are competently
done, and Valentine makes the five amps attached to her bass

do the heaviest work for her. "To The Plate" may be one of
the best rock songs to ever last less than two minutes. The DJ
scratching of "Nickel to Roll" combines with the rest of the
track for a very tripped out track, that, if anything, will make
you wonder what Beck would sound like if he was a woman
and hadn't become popular.
This band is still young, however, and it's youth shows up
on some tracks pretty clearly. "Long Live the King" jams
but has the feel of a garage session to it as well. "Dying in
White" simply tries too hard to be a collision between Por
tishead type vocals and Slipknot musicality. The result is in
teresting, but not necessarily what you want, and too long.
"Glamourpuss" is just kind of dull, and "Hero Worship"
also is hit-or-miss.
Overall, this is the start of something good. At this point,
it would be nice to grab the ground floor before success
mucks it all up. The group is playing in San Francisco at
Bottom of the Hill (1233 17th Street) on July 20. Give them
a try. Use Napster to get a track or two if you have to; it's
worth it.
