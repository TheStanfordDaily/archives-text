# Toni Estes breaks no new ground in debut
## 
### WILL TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There are some things in the
world that are truly consistent:
the Chicago Cubs losing, Stan
ford winning the Sears Cup and
John Cusack movies. Unfortu
nately, there are also some con
sistent things in this world that
genuinely should change, if only
because they suffer from an al
most criminal case of neglect.
Among these are: the lack of
recognition for track and field
athletes in the United States, the
state of R&B music and the
Chicago Cubs losing.
Unfortunately, Toni Estes
can only affect R&B music. The

young songwriter contributed a
cut to the soundtrack for the film
"Next Friday." It's a nice little
dance track called "Hot." The
rest of her debut album, titled
"Two-Eleven," fails to draw
properly from the strengths that
Estes has, namely her songwrit
ing abilities. Instead it descends
into the trap that so much mod
ern R&B tends to do and substi
tutes fluffing for stuffing.
The 12-track album doesn't
distinguish itself at all from the
other four billion or so artists
that are currently in circulation,
right down to the overused mu
sical arrangements. Estes does

Torii Estes blends in with all that other R & B.
provide some interesting links to
the past, however. She covers the
old Guy song "Let's Chill," though
one must wonder about the musi
cal state of a genre that could allow
this to be considered a classic.
Other songs evoke more innov
ative times in the genre, "Change
of Heart," a synthesizer driven jam
session, reminds one strongly of
the '80s, when R&B was being re
written by a young man called
Prince. Here, she is able to toy
around a bit more with her tonali

ty, and the musical arrangements
actually accent her abilities. Unfor
tunately these tracks are songs that
have already been done, and done
much better, by other Tonis, such
as Toni Braxton and Tony Toni
Tone.
That said, there is the potential
for better things from Estes here.
"You Don't Got What I Want" will
likely be a breakout single. The
beats laid down by producer Jon-
John are competent, and Estes is
allowed to let some of her own
spunk come through. "Adore
You" and "She Can't" are also
songs that make one wish Estes' tal
ents had fallen into the hands of
better producers. It would be in

teresting to see what a Babyface or
Wydef Jean coulcl manage when
teamed with Estes.
Her songwriting skills are more
than up to the task (the track "She's
Already" would make an incredi
ble acoustic ballad), but in this
album Estes is the victim of a musi
cal genre that is slowly choking the
life from its own creativity.
