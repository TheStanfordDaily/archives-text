There are some things in the
world that are truly consistent:
the Chicago Cubs losing, Stan
ford winning the Sears Cup and
John Cusack movies. Unfortu

sistent things in this world that
genuinely should change, if only
because they suffer from an al
most criminal case of neglect.
Among these are: the lack of
recognition for track and field
athletes in the United States, the
state of R&B music and the
Chicago Cubs losing.

can only affect R&B music. The

young songwriter contributed a
cut to the soundtrack for the film
"Next Friday." It's a nice little
dance track called "Hot." The
rest of her debut album, titled
"Two-Eleven," fails to draw
properly from the strengths that
Estes has, namely her songwrit
ing abilities. Instead it descends
into the trap that so much mod
ern R&B tends to do and substi
tutes fluffing for stuffing.
The 12-track album doesn't
distinguish itself at all from the
other four billion or so artists
that are currently in circulation,
right down to the overused mu
sical arrangements. Estes does
