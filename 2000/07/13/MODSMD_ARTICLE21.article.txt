# Willis 'Kids' around in 'Sixth Sense' followup
## 
### AMANDA CANEVARO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Following the old adage "Ifit ain't broke, don't fix it," Bruce
Willis follows up his performance in the box-office sensation
"The Sixth Sense" by starring alongside another kid. Instead
of dead people, this time the kid sees himself as a 40-year-old
loser.
Willis plays the ultra-successful, sleek and lean Russ Duritz
who has neglected his childhood dream of becoming a pilot in
favor of wealth and power. Everything changes when his
inner child breaks out of 1968 and lands on his doorstep.
Russ's supernatural visit from his 8-year-old self, Rusty Duritz
(Spencer Breslin) changes their lives.
Rusty is a chubby and semi-awkward but sweet lx>y who
only reminds Russ of his painful childhood as the schoolyard
punching bag. Now, just to clarify, Rusty is an actual person,
not just a hallucination, but the movie thankfully skips over the
logistics and ramifications of time travel to simplify the plot.
Rusty is as unhappy with his future self as Russ is with his for
mer self. Acouple of days before his 40th birthday, Russ is a sin
gle and lonely image consultant with a facial tic:. He only has two
people in his life: Amy (Emily Mortimer), a woman he refuses
to commit to and Janet (Lily Tomlin), his wisecracking assistant.
Constantly critical of Rusty's weight, speech and demeanor,
Russ misinterprets the purpose of Rusty's visit. He thinks he
was meant to revamp the 8-year-old's image and change his
tory. Russ eventually realizes that you can't change the past
and concludes Rusty transcended time to change him. To
gether, the two recreate childhood memories and discuss old
dreams. They even travel back to 1968 where Russ coaches
Rusty through his first schoolyard fight.
In this far-fetched comedy the formulaic plot receives a
much needed jolt at the end with a sugar-coated but unex
pected ending. Unfortunately that is the only thing that's un
expected. If you saw the trailer then you have already seen the
funniest parts of this movie.
Willis delivers a believable performance as a Russ but it is the
supporting cast that shines. You may remember the adorable
Breslin from his McDonald's commercial where at 3-years-old
he perfectly delivered the "two all-beef patties, special sauce let
tuce cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame bun" ingredients of a
Big Mac to Charles Barkley. Breslin's sweet demeanor and nat
ural sense of humor perfecdy compliment Willis.
Without upstaging Willis, Lily Tomlin delivers a scene
stealing performance as Willis' dry and witty assistant. Willis
and Tomlin enjoy a wonderful chemistry that carries the
movie through some lulls. Unfortunately, Willis was not as
lucky with co-star Emily Mortimer who plays his love interest
Amy. The two seem utterly incompatible and their story-line
is unbelievable. Russ is constantly sarcastic and usually down
right mean to Amy. It is hard to believe that deep down the
two really like each other and are capable of a serious relation
ship. Despite this bungle, Willis' funny supporting cast makes
him kx)k good.
I he Kid more than earns the "great for the whole family"
label because it works on two levels. Its in-your-face symbolism
and straightforward plot allow kids to enjoy the movie, but the
film also speaks to adults and specifically to men. It is a scathing
critique of men too wrapped up in their professional lives and
material wealth to forge human connections and live out
dreams. The film encourages a reconnection with childhood
and forgotten aspirations. It reminds everyone what it was like
to be a kid and creates a longing to return to the childhood
world of possibilities and opportunities.
If you're looking for a benign and uplifting comedy this

summer, (heck out
"The Kid." Along the
way to a sugary conclu
sion the movie does
have a few entertaining
bits. Look for a hairy
cameo by Willis' real
life Friend' Matthew

Perry as well as a scientific explanation for why a lull moon can
have an orange tint. You'll enjoy some tender moments and
who knows, the movie may even bring out your inner child.
