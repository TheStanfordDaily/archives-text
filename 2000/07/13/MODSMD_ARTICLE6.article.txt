## Stein named chair of the Board of Trustees 
### DENNIS TYLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Once again, Stanford is experiencing a
changing of the guard. This time it lies with
in the Board of Trustees.
Isaac Stein, a board member since 1994,
will be succeeding Robert Bass as the new
chair of the Board ofTrustees. Stein is pres
ident and founder of Waverley Associates
Inc., a private investment firm and is a resi
dent of Palo Alto.
"This is an exciting time for Stanford.
Thanks to the leadership of Gerhard
Casper and Bob Bass, we are starting the
new millennium as a strong University,"
said Isaac Stein in the Stanford Report. "To
gether with a new president and new
provost, I am looking forward to making
the University even stronger."
Many of his colleagues agree that Stein

will contribute a lot to the University.
"Stein has been very thoughtful, diligent
and innovative and creative in his Board
service. 1 look forward to his leadership,"
Bass, who will remain on the Board of
Trustees, told the Stanford Report.
According to Provost John Hennessy,
"Isaac brings several wonderful qualities to
the job, including his passion for Stanford,
his ability to work well with both his fellow
trustees and the administration and his in
credible capacity for strategic thinking."
Stein served on the search committee
which recommended that Hennessy be ap
pointed as the next president of Stanford.
Stein, who received his MBA and law de
grees from Stanford in 1972 and holds a
bachelor's degree from Colgate University,
has been on several other committees at
Stanford.
He has served as chairman of the boards

of UCSF Stanford Health Care and of Stan
ford Health Services and was a member of
the Law School Board of Visitors. He con
tinues to serve on the National Advisory
Board of Stanford's Haas Center for Public
Service.
In choosing the new chair, Patty Cheng,
assitant secretary to the Board of Trustees,
claims that there are no set standards ap
plied to each candidate.
"The Board seeks to appoint a Chair who
is able to best address the priorities and
needs of the University at the time. No spe
cific criteria are Ã¼biquitously applied to each
new Chair," said Cheng.
The Board of Trustees generally focuses
on handling long-range issues rather than
present day problems.
"The Board of Trustees functions as a
trust and as such is responsible for the fu
ture as well as the present. The Board han-

dies a range of issues, some are regular, re
curring items like the annual budget plan
and tuition setting," said Cheng.
"It would be inaccurate to say that the
Board handles all issues concerning the
University. However, the Board's primary
role is to ensure the success of the Universi
ty in perpetuity; as such, the Board general
ly focuses more on the long-term issues (as
opposed to day-to-day affairs)," she added.
In the future, however, there are no plans
to create more student involvement within
the Board of Trustees, beyond the commit
tees that have already been implemented.
"The Board operates through the com
mittees. Students have been represented on
the committees. The Board's primary func
tion is to ensure the future prosperity of the
University, rather than to solve today's
