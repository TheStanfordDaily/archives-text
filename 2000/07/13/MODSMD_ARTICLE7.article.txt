## 
### GREG BRAZEAL EDITORIAL STAFF 
Beginning Jan. 1, 2001, Stan
ford's dean for religious life will
be the Rev. William "Scotty"
McLennan Jr., the inspiration
for the liberal, red-bearded Rev.
Scott Sloan in the comic strip
Doonesbury. McLennan has
served as chaplain at Tufts Uni
versity since 1984.
"1 hope my appointment at
Stanford will be best known for its
prophetic dimensions," McLen
nan told the Stanford Report,
"challenging the status quo in the
name of higher values. For exam
ple, I am deeply concerned by the
way the rich seem to be getting
richer and the poor poorer in
America and around the world."
The Rev. Kelly Denton-
Borhaug, who has served as in
terim dean for religious life, will
depart at the end of July to take
up an appointment as chaplain
and assistant professor of reli
gion at Goucher College. She
had held the post since 1998,
when former Dean Robert
Gregg returned to teaching lull
time.
"I have feelings of profound
gratitude for some wonderful
and generous individuals I have
come to know during the past
four years in my work at Stanford
University," Denton-Borhaug
told the Stanford Report. She
originally served as one of three
associate deans for religious life.
"I wish the University communi
ty every blessing."
University President Gerhard

Casper announced McLennan's
appointment on June 19, saying,
"Rev. McLennan combines a
nonsectarian view of the campus
ministry with a wide-ranging in
terest in ethical issues that should
serve Stanford well."
In 1975, McLennan received
master of divinity and law de
grees from Harvard Divinity
School and Harvard Law School,
and was also ordained a Unitari
an Universalist minister. In addi
tion to his duties as Tufts chap
lain, McLennan teaches business
ethics as a senior lecturer at Har
vard Business School.
Provost John Hennessy and
Electrical Engineering Prof.
Brad Osgood co-chaired the
search committee that recom
mended McLennan.
"Scotty had a particularly in
teresting background, being a
lawyer in addition to being a min
ister," Osgood told the Stanford
Report. Before taking up his po
sition as chaplain at Tufts,
McLennan worked as a church
sponsored lawyer for low-income
residents of Boston's Dorchester
neighborhood.
"Stanford is situated in a
unique position in the economi
cally thriving Silicon Valley, but
in close proximity also to some
of the worst poverty in Ameri
ca," McLennan said. "I hope to
exercise whatever leadership 1
can in this area, and in other
areas of moral, ethical and spiri
tual concern."
His recent book, "Finding
Your Religion: When the Faith
You Grew Up With Has Lost Its

Meaning," attempts to explain
why so many Americans leave
their traditional faiths for anoth
er. Himself a religious convert,
McLennan said of the book, "I
was able to pull together a life
time of academic learning and
personal experience. . . The
writing experience was a joy,
feeling as if 1 was living and
breathing my passion onto the
pages."
The book describes six stages
of spiritual development by
weaving together personal sto
ries from Tufts members with
McLennan's own experiences. It
contains an introduction written
by Doonesbury creator Garry
Trudeau, who roomed with Mc-
Clennan during their under
graduate years at Yale in the late
'60s.
Unlike Hunter S. Thompson,
who has expressed the desire to
"rip Trudeau's lungs out" as a re
sult of his portrayal in Doonesbury,
McLennan has told People Maga
zine that he has a lot in common
with his illustrated counterpart.
"He is a liberal, politically active
character who has gotten into (he
same issues — the sanctuary
movement, the antiapartheid
movement, getting one's web page
up as a chaplain — though usually
before I have," McLennan is quot
ed as saying in the June 5, 1999
issue of People. "I would hope that
he's a little more simplistic than I
am. But Garry never consults me
about this."
Doonesbury's Rev. Scott Sloan
is also named after the Rev.
William Sloane (Coffin, a vocal and

war activist and Yale chaplain who
was McLennan's mentor.
McLennan will be on campus
for freshman convocation and

the inauguration of Hennessy,
though his two teenage sons and
his wife, Ellen, will not move to
Stanford until lanuarv.
