# Bettinger to lead Knight Fellows
## 
### ALICIA MCCANN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a highly competitive
search process, James R. Bet
tinger has been selected as
the Communication Depart
ment's new director of the
Knight Fellowships. Bet
tinger will succeed James V.
Risser, who is retiring after
over 15 years in the position.
A selective search commit
tee composed of five Stanford
professors and three profes
sional journalists considered
40 people nationwide for the
position and named Bettinger
as the new director on June 28.
He looks forward to helping
the program maintain its status
as "an asset to the Stanford
community."
The Knight Fellowship pro
gram was first initiated in 1966
with an original gi ant of $ 1 mil
lion from the Ford Foundation.
As a result of its enthusiastic re
ception, the program received
subsequent grants, culminating
in a $4 million gift from the
Knight Foundation in 1984.
"I am delighted with Jim
Bettinger's selection. He's done
a superb job as deputy director

for the past decade," said the
departing Risser. "His dedica
tion to the program and to the
improvement of journalism
make him an excellent choice."
The goal of the Knight Fel
lowship program is to take pro
fessional journalists out of the
field and provide them with a
free year of education at Stan
ford and a living stipend. Dur
ing that time, the fellows are en
couraged to take classes in a va
riety of subject areas and attend
weekly seminars. According to
Bettinger, the expectation is
that the knowledge gained will
then be taken back into the
world of journalism and lead to
its improvement.
As Bettinger explains, the se
lection process is extremely
competitive. For the 2000-01
year, approximately 170 Amer
ican and foreign applicants
were considered. The program
accepts 12 American and up to
eight foreign journalists.
In the upcoming year, any
changes made will be "building
on the foundation of the cur
rent program," said Bettinger.
In the future, the program
will address recent trends in the
world of journalism stemming

from new information technol
ogy and other market influ
ences. The fellows will benefit
from an education about how to
"harness these changing forces
instead of being bufl'eted by
them," said Bettinger.
Although these challenges
lie ahead, Bettinger remains
enthusiastic.
"I think the biggest change is
that the director has full respon
sibility for the long-term im
provement and growth of the
program," said Bettinger.
He is pleased with the Com
munication Department's com
mitment to the program, and
feels that the fellows are a won
derful addition to the Stanford
community.
Bettinger said, "Professors
like the level of engagement"
that they have with the Knight
fellows.
In die near future, he will

begin the selection process tor a
new deputy director to work
with him on the program.
Bettinger first arrived at the
Farm as a Knight Fellow himself
in 1982. Since 1989, he has
served as the deputy director of
the program. He also has an ex
tensive history within the field of
journalism, having worked in
such positions as the a.m. city
editor of the San Jose Mercury
News and a city editor of the
Riverside Press-Enterprise.
In addition to his qualifica
tions as a journalist, Bettinger
has also entered into the class
room. His appointment as di
rector was accompanied by the
distinction of professor, and he
will be teaching graduate jour
nalism classes. During his years
at Stanford, he has taught for
Ijoth the University and its con
tinuing studies program and
will do so in the future.
