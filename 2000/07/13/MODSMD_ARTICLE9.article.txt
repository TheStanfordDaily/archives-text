### YVETTE ARTIGA 
French Prof. Alphonse Juilland, a world renowned linguist,
track star and former head of the French and Italian Department
at Stanford, died after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage at his
campus home on June 30. He was 77 years old.
Katarina Kivel, who worked for Juilland as his administrative
assistant in the Department of French and Italian and then as
managing editor of the scholarly journals he founded, said, "I will
always remember Prof. Juilland as a warm and charismatic hu
manist, a creative and diplomatic leader, as well as a distinguished
professor who made many contributions to promote French cul
ture in the United States."
According to Kivel, "his passion for writing was only equally
matched by his passionate pursuit of athletic excellence."
Born in Bucharest and raised in Switzerland, Juilland gradu
ated magna cum laude from the University of Bucharest in 1945
and studied in Paris, where he earned his doctorate from the Sor
bonne in 1951.
He taught at several U.S. universities before his appointment
to Stanford as the William Bonsall Professor of French, Emeritus.
He died on June 30 after years of innovative contributions to both
the academic world and the Stanford campus.
Juilland also wrote more than a dozen books on linguistics,
ranging from studies of French to a Gypsy dictionary. He also
wrote several books about the contributions to the French lan
guage of 20th century French novelist Louis-Ferdinand Celine.
At Stanford, he was the founding editor of the Stanford French
Review, Stanford Italian Review and Stanford Literature Review.
I le also created a publishing house called Anma Libri, which pub
lished scholarly works.
Twice in 1975 and once again in 1988 he was decorated by the
Fi ench government, first with the award Chevalier dans I'Ordre
des Palmes Academiques and later with the award Officer dans

l'Order des Palmes Academiques for his contributions to French
culture and French education in the United States.
Juilland was not only influential on campus as a scholar, but
also as a political conservative. He provided a counterpoint to the
prevailing liberal point of view on the Stanford campus during
the turbulent 19705.
He founded the Stanford Conservative Forum and brought
noted conservative thinkers to the campus, among them William
F. Buckley Jr. and Ernest Van den Haag.
In 1983, he almost single-handedly organized a petition
drive, persuading 131 faculty to protest a proposed Univer
sity committee to reassess the University's relationship with
the Hoover Institution.
He contended that the investigation would include studying
alleged political partisanship and therefore was a "grave threat to
academic freedom."
He told a campus newspaper in 1985 that he expected uni
versities to have more liberals than conservatives because "intel
lectuals place a heavy premium on reason. As children of the En
lightenment, liberals believe they stand on fact and reason; con
servatives know they ultimately stand on faith."
Juilland also published his conservative philosophy in the Na
tional Review.
According to Margaret Tompkins, a staff member in the
French Department, Juilland was also "a Renaissance man who
had many interests, including track and field."
During the 1960s and 19705, he competed in masters track
and field events and held world records for men 50 years of age
and older in the 100 meters, 200 meters and 400 meters. Accord
ing to family members, he had recently accepted a challenge to
race a former student.
