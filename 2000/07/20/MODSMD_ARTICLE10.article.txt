## DAILY VIEWPOINT Extolling the virtues of MTV's SoCal Summer 
### ALICE BROWN STAFF COLUMNIST 
Because there's a lot going on in my life, 1
have to carefully choose how to spend my pre
cious free time. It's an easy call: I spend all of
it watching MTV'.
I realize that this column will alienate cer
tain people — those who feel they're above
the cheesy pop-culture of the "Real World,"
"Total Request Live" and "Sisqo's Summer
Shakedown." They're not into "Say What?
Karaoke." They have no interest in seeing
how Britney Spears came up with the concept
for her new video. (Unless they're male, in
which case even if they say they don't want to
watch it, they're lying.)
But I'd like to extol the virtues of this qual
ity station by outlining a few of the ways in
which my life has been enriched by channel
16 (at Stanford) and channel 37 (in Washing
ton D.C.).
1.) Christina Aguilera's MTV special, titled
"What a Girl Wants," taught me and millions
of other teenagers a valuable lesson: when
you say the word "like" 17 times a sentence,
you sound extremely intelligent. I have never
heard someone sound as smart and articulate

as Ms. Aguilera. (ex: Like, I totally, like, like
Madonna, and I think she's, like, a really
good, tee hee, like, you know, like, role
model). If MTV hadn't aired this priceless
hour of television, think how many kids
would not have become more aware of their
diction. Bravo, MTV! Bravo, Christina! Ter
rific public service.
2.) 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys are
good clean fun. And they personally pro
vide me with enormous amounts of enter
tainment, especially if I happen to be
watching them on TV while sitting with a
member of the opposite sex. "Would you
rather be in 'N Sync or the Backstreet
Boys?" is a terrific question to ask. Because
as much as he says he doesn't know the dif
ference, doesn't care or wouldn't be caught
dead in a "boy band," he's lying, and you
get to find fun ways to prove it.
3.) "The Real World" has taught me a lot
about the real world. I feel infinitely more
prepared to be out on my own after having
watched several seasons of this popular MTV
show. It illustrates that lying around in paja
mas and drinking a lot and having 382 con
versations a day about "relationships" and
bitching about your friends behind their

backs is perfectly acceptable and really all you
ever do ... so why go to the library?
4.) "FANatic" is absolutely the greatest show
in the world. If you're ever feeling down on
yourself, or you're thinking you're a loser or
you feel stupid and psycho and that you have
no life, tune in. Instantly you will feel 4,385
times better about yourself, because I guaran
tee that the people who send in their tapes to
prove that they are Luke Perry's / Tyrese's /
C )/.zy Ozborne's / Jennifer Love Hewitt's
BIGGESTEVEROHMYGOD!!!!! fan are
FAR worse off than you. "FANatic"— a com
plete and total ego boost in just 30 minutes.
5.) The crown jewel of MTV: "Total Re
quest Live," or "TRL" to us insiders. Who
doesn't like to unwind at the end of a long day
by watching hundreds of 13-year-old girls
mooning over 'N Sync side-by-side with sub
urban teenage boys who think Limp Bizkit
RULFS and chilling with 17-year-old girls
who "have a lot of respect for Eminem be
cause he doesn't care what other people think
of him?" It's so full of energy — and really re
ally loud screams that force you to mute the
TV. I love it! I wish I could request a song on
the air: "Hi, I'm Ali and I came ALL the way
from Washington, D.C. to request Backstreet

Boys' "The One," because they're the one tor
nie!!!!! Woooohhhhhhhhhhhh!" "TRL" is <t
high-quality show that brings together all
sorts ofinteresting people with different back
grounds and sophisticated tastes in music.
Thank God for Carson Daly.
(5.) A final highlight of MTV is the station's
informative news briefs (ex: "This just in: Re
ports that pop princess Britney Spears and 'N
Sync frontman Justin Timberlake are en
gaged are NOT TRUE. I repeat, they are
both STILL AVAILABLE.") I, for one, would
not be able to sleep at night had I not heard
this outrageous and upsetting rumor de
bunked. It's pertinent news like this that
MTV brings to you, the viewer.
So maybe I haven't made converts out ol
all of you, but I don't think anyone can dis
pute the obvious merits of MTV listed above.
So please, join me in forsaking all original
thought, all traces of taste and all roads-not
taken and surrendering myself completely
and totally to Ananda, to Carson, to Kurt
Loder and of course to Eminem. ("Cause he's
SUCH LIKE A ROLE MODEL!!!"').
