# DAILY VIEWPOINT
## Educate yourself and rock the vote 
### ANUJ GUPTA STAFF COLUMNIST 
In the coming year, simply be
cause you are at Stanford, you will
be faced with many important deci
sions: inside room or outside room,
the 12 meals plus points meal plan
or the 14 meals a week meal plan,
writing for The Daily or The Chap
pie. Okay, so that last one is no con
test, but it's important nonetheless.
There is another choice you can
make, starting now, that can be
more significant than your two
room double and more consequen
tial than your meal plan, and that is
whether or not to engage yourself
in the historic presidential cam
paign unfolding in our midst.
Now don't be afraid, I am not
here to urge you to register to vote
or to stamp the date of Nov. 7 into
your mind to ensure you make the
trip to the polls that day. I will leave
those tasks in the very capable
hands of the people at Stanford in
Government, as well as beautiful
people like Carson Daly, 98 De
grees and Jennifer Lopez, who re
mind you to "Choose or Lose" on
MTV.
No, that is not my goal. If you
are simply going to trudge to the

voting booth in order to check oil
every name that has the word "De
mocrat" listed next to it, or the
name of every woman running for
office or every candidate who has
the same middle initial as your fa
vorite Backstreet Boy, then why
bother?
Suffrage is a privilege that has
been battled for by many groups in
America's history, and to take ad
vantage of it while completely unin
formed is to abuse it in the most un
fortunate manner.
Becoming engaged in the cam
paign by no means requires that
you give up your day job (or your
$ 1 ()0-an-hour internship at Never-
GonnaMakeAProfit.com) in order
to count the number of times
George VV. smirks on average per
interview, write a thesis on the rela
tive soporific effects of Nytol versus
A 1 Gore or follow Hillary's alleged
use of ethnic slurs in decades yore.
fndeed, the parlor game that
politicos are currently amusing
themselves with — Who Wants to
Be a Running Mate? — is about as
scintillating as that übiquitous ABC
game show, minus the appeal of
Regis.
However, in the fnformation
Age, the amount of effort one

needs to expend to come across in
formation about the campaigns is
minimal. Start small: pick up that
journalistic pantheon USA Today
and stare for a minute at one of
their colorful pie charts about the
campaign. Hit up a political Web
site, whether an official campaign
site, a comprehensive news site
(All Politics.com) or a hip e-zine
(Salon.com). Hell, even flip on
Crossfire or MSNBC and watch a
bunch of well-coiffed white men in
suits yell at each other about the
topic of the day.
In any of these activities, the
point is that you pay attention to
and consider the issues and people
involved in these races. Hi is cam
paign is not about personalities, es
pecially this year; after all, there is a
reason why Creen Party nominee
Ralph Nader collectively refers to
the major party candidates as
"Gush."
No, this campaign is about who
will build the next Supreme Court,
with up to four justices' seats open
ing up, and the fates of abortion,
the death penalty and school
prayer in the United States poten
tially hanging in the balance.
This campaign is about peace
and prosperity, and, for the first

time in ages, the question is not
which candidate can more firmly
establish those elusive goals, but
who can maintain them in our era
of dizzying technological and eco
nomic growth.
This campaign is about how our
children will be educated in the
coming decades, with revolutionary
developments such as private
school vouchers and charter schools
reshaping the face of learning.
Even though this is summer,
most of us continue to lead busy
lives. On top of work or classes, we
have plenty of other ways to occu
py our attention. For me, it's "Sur
vivor," Eminem, the Lakers' new
star forward Mark Madsen and
the trailer for "Coyote Ugly" that
seem to provide far more instant

gratification than the distant
world of politics.
But if you can't spare a lew min
utes to pay attention to the elections
this year, then the catchy slogan
Carson presents to you on "Total
Request Live" might as well be
"Lose or Lose."
Opt for the inside room, 12 plus
points, The Daily, and finally,
choose to plug yourself in to Cam
paign 2000. And then call 1-800-
DIAL-MTV and request "It's
Oonna Be Me." You'll be glad yon
did, on all accounts.
