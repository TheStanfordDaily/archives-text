## Jennings, Stember qualify for the Olympics 
### BEN ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With 11 Stanford athletes com
peting in the Olympic Trials in
Sacramento last weekend and next,
the success of Cardinal track and
field is about to become an interna
tional phenomenon.
Two Stanford athletes — sopho
more Oabe Jennings and junior
Michael Stember — have already
earned passage to Sydney with first
and third place showings, respec
tively, in the 1,500 meters.
Now, at the Trials' halfway point,
most of Stanford's competitors have
taken their shot at Olympic glory. A
few, however, still have a chance to
join Jennings and Stember down
under.
Cardinal owns
men's 1,500 meters
While the media continues to
play him up as a free-spirited hippie
percussionist, Jennings' feet have
drummed up more noise than his
instruments at the Trials. After plac
ing first and second in their semifi
nal heat Friday, Jennings and Stem
ber toed the line as the only colle
gians to advance to Sunday's final.
The pace was quick from the
start, and the Stanford duo let the
pack control the race through the
first 400 meters. But when former
California star Richie Boulet sprint
ed to the lead, Jennings followed
him through the half mile in 1
minute, 56.95 seconds, and the pack
began to stratify.
When Jennings overt(x>k Boulet
with 500 meters remaining, both
Jennings and Stember's prospects
looked tenuous — could Jennings

hold the lead, and could Stember
move up from seventh?
But as Jennings' lead only
widened, he seemed to pull Stember
out from the pack. Cruising through
his final 4(H) meters in 56.5 seconds,
Jennings burst across the finish
stripe in first place at 3:35.90. He
threw his hands in the air as Stem
ber, who had overcome everyone
but Reebok's Jason Pyrah in the final
100, crossed in 3:37.04. Both times
marked personal bests.
"If you know you can win from
800 meters out, why would you wait
until the last 2(X)? I believe you have
to run with your heart," Jennings
said. "When you get into a competi
tion like this, you must rely on your
heart and not on your kick."
Jennings' time is the fastest
among Americans this year, but
Stember must improve his time to
the Olympic 'A' standard of 3:36.80
to cash in on his finish. Two meets at
Stanford — on J uly 26 and 29 —will
give Stember the opportunity to do
just that.
Stember, however, isn't thinking
that far ahead quite yet. He still must
compete in the 8(X) meters at the
Trials, and the qualifying rounds
start tomorrow. He has already met
the 'A' standard in that event of
1:46.20.
Hausers try the 5,000 meters
The 10,000-meter run may
have been Brad and Brent
Hauser's best shot at an Olympic
berth this year, but don't tell them
that. After Brad placed fifth and
Brent did not finish Friday night's
10,000 meters, the duo came back
to place first and second, respec
tively, in their semifinal of the

5,000 meters on Monday.
Easily handling a field that in
cluded last year's United States' one
two combo of Adam Coucher and
Bob Kennedy, the Hausers cruised
to times of 13:43.33 and 13:43.86
and made themselves marked men
heading into tomorrow night's final.
Fellow senior Jason Balkman's
13:52.12 was not enough to advance.
Sophomore Jonathon Riley, who
placed even further back at
14:02.55, will be present in the final.
Stripped of his right shoe just 2,000
meters into the race, Riley perse
vered to the finish and won his ap
peal to appear in the final.
"It tore off the skin on the bottom
of my foot and right around my
pinkie," Riley said. "I just couldn't
go fast"
Women have one more shot
Three of the four Stanford
women who qualified for the Tri
als have already competed, with
mixed results.
Junior Sally Glynn did not ad
vance past the preliminaries in
the 1,500 meters or 5,000 meters,
and freshman Lauren Fleshman
did not advance to the finals in
the 5,000 meters.
In the discus, however, senior
Summer Pierson entered the fi
nals in fourth position with a
throw of 184 feet, 6 inches before
falling to eighth overall.
The women's last chance rests
with freshman pole vaulter Kath
leen Donaghue, whose chances of
advancing past qualifying rounds
are slim. Donaghue has cleared
13 - 1/2, but it will take a leap of
close to 15 feet to make the top
three.

Stevenson can't catch a break
Senior pole vaulter Toby Steven
son looked to be in trouble Friday
night when his pole snapped on his
way up to the bar at the opening
height of 17-10 1/2.
Stevenson took the snap lightly,
flexing with the remnants of the pole
in his hands, and went on to advance
to the final with a leap of 18-2 1/2.
He failed to clear anv more

heights and finished tied for 11 th
place overall.
Athletes left to compete
Brad and Brent Hauser along
with Jonathon Riley are left to com
pete in the S,(KX) meter run tomor
row. Michael Stember will compete
in the 8(H) meters today, and Kath
leen Donaghue will compete in the
women's pole vault tomorrow.
