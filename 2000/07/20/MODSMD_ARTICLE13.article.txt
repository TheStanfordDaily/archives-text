Goodbye gl ass. llcllo hard courts.
Now that Wimbledon has ended, the
women on the WTA are preparing on hard
courts for the U.S. Open, which l>egins in Au
gust. Where better to prepare than at Stan
ford?
The Bank of the West tournament is com
ing to the Taube Family Tennis Stadium
starting Monday. This Corel WTA Tour Tier
II event has a 28-player singles draw and 16-
player doubles draw. Expected to play are
defending champion Lindsay Davenport and
recent Wimbledon winner Venus Williams,
as well as Mary Pierce, Monica Seles, Serena
Williams and Anna Koumikova.
With such a loaded field, these players will
definitely provide some memorable show

downs throughout the seven-clay event.
Coming off her disappointment at Wim
bledon, Davenport will be looking to get back
on track at the Bank of the West. Additional
ly, if Davenport wants to remain in the race
for the number one ranking with Martina
Hingis, she has to win this tournament to de
fend her ranking points.
Meanwhile, Venus, fresh off her Wimble
don championship last month, is probably
the most confident player in the field. Alter
not getting past the quarterfinals in any other
Grand Slam than the U.S. Open, she beat
both Hingis and Davenport for the champi
onship â€” all only a few months after coming
back on the tour from a six-month layoff due
to tendonitis in both wrists.
To make this tournament even more ex
citing, both Venus and her sister Serena will
be making a rare dual appearance at a non-

Grand Slam event.
Serena will lx- in full force as she prepares
to defend her U.S. ()pen crown from a year
ago. Given her history, though, she won't
have much to worry about. Serena has win
ning records against numerous top players,
including Davenport and Hingis, and none
of these players will be looking forward to see
ing her on the other side of the court. In fact,
the only player that has given her any trouble
has been her big sister, Venus.
But don't count out the other participants,
who are capable of beating anyone on any
day. French Open champion Mary Pierce
and nine-time Grand Slam champion Moni
ca Seles both have the ability to power their
opponents off the court. Pierce has a fierce
forehand that keeps players pinned behind

tlie baseline, while Seles has the
most powerful, sharply-angled
groundstrokes on the tour.
However, they may be lacking
confidence. Even though Pierce
won the French Open champi
onship, she is still belaboring her
second round exit from Wimble
don. And while Seles has been
playing incredibly consistent ten
nis, she has not been able to out
duel the top two players in the
world, Hingis and Davenport. She
does not seem to believe that she
can beat the top players.
Then there is Kournikova, the
glamour queen of the tour. She at
tracts thousands of fans from all
over the world and gets attention
from all of the reporters and pho
tographers, but she still has not
captured a WTA title. Perhaps she
can change tilings at this tourna
ment.
With so many potential rivalries
at this event, promoters are ex
pecting record crowds for the
tournament. The organizers are
building more seats onto the
Taube Tennis Stadium to accom
modate the fans, with more than
40,000-plus people total expected
with a seating capacity of 4,500
seats around two match courts.
The tournament has a purse of
$535,000. The lucky winner will
receive $80,000.
