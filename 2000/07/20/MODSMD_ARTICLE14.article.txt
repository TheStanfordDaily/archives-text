# Tiger, expectations head to Scotland
## 
### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
After a month below the na
tional radar, it's time for the
Tiger Woods Show to return
from its hiatus. The British
Open, golfs oldest major cham
pionship, returns to the hallowed
ground of The Old Gourse at St.
Andrews today as the entire
world anxiously waits for golfs
new master to complete a career
Grand Slam at the tender age of
24.
Yes,-Woods is the overwhelm
ing (2-to-l) favorite coming into
the 129 th edition of the Open,
thanks to the lack of score-killing
trees and the relative length of
the course. In the wake of his
earth-shattering 15-shot win at
last month's U.S. Open, many are
proclaiming the Stanford alum is
untouchable, but golf has a funny
way of being rather unpre
dictable at times. Just two weeks
ago, Woods' putter went south
on him during the Western
Open, leading to a finish back in
the pack.
A whole spate of other con
tenders will also tee it off in Scot
land over the weekend, ranging
from the good (Ernie Els) to the
bad (David Duval) and the ugly
(John Daly).
Els, who won a tune-up tour
nament last weekend at Loch
Lomond, has finished second to
Woods four times within the past
year thanks to shaky rounds on
Sundays but will be a big threat
with his steady play and lack of
mental mistakes.
As for Duval, he has fallen off
in a big way from the pace he set
in 1998 and 1999 with eight total
wins and has been all hut forgot
ten among the recent Tigerma
nia. Much like Tiger, his length
should keep him in contention as
long as he keeps his iron shots
under control.
Daly, meanwhile, has much

bigger problems on his hands.
Within the past two years he has
suffered through embarrassing
showings at the U.S. Open while
giving the PGA Tour migranes
with his drinking and unruly be
havior. It seems hard to believe
he won the Open only five years
ago, the last time at St. Andrews,
but the reality is he will never be
a threat until he resolves his per
onal problems and concentrates
on golf.
The biggest surprise of'late on
the PGA Tour has been the play
of Notah Begay 111. Tiger's for
mer teammate on the Stanford
golfteam. Begay won two tourna
ments in a row at the end of June
and nearly beat Els last week at
Loch Lomond. He's yet to show
up in a major tournament, but his
putting has been unreal the last
month or so, giving him a chance
if he can harness St. Andrews'
lighting-quick greens.
The European delegation will
be led by the likes of Lee West
wood, defending champion Paul
Lawrie and native son Colin
Montgomerie. Westwood has
been sizzling of late, but a wrist
injury to Lawrie, who hasn't
played well since last year's
Open, threatens to take him out
of the competition before it be
gins. And of course, Monty, the
golfer Americans love to hate, still
is looking for his first major, with
all the expectations of Scotland
on his back.
Any preview wouldn't be com
plete without a darkhorse pick,
so here's one from this corner:
Justin Leonard. The Ben Hogan
protege has fared well in Britain
— he won the Open back at Royal
Troon in 1997 for his lone major
win and finished second in a play
off to Lawrie at Carnoustie last
year. He's gone winless for a
while and is due for a big break
through tournament, and there's
no reason St. Andrews' can't pro
vide him with it.
