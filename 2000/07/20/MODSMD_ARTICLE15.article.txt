Baseball ace Wayne
inks with Expos

Justin Wayne, who helped lead
the Stanford baseball team to a sec
ond place showing at the College
World Series last season, signed a

profess io nal
contract with
the Montreal
Expos on July
14. The Expos
had taken
Wayne fifth
overall in the
June amateur
draft.

"The Expos are delighted to have
Justin join the organization and wish
him the best of luck as he prepares
for his Major League career in the
not too distant future," said Expos
Ceneral Manager Jim Beattie.
Wayne completed an outstand
ing collegiate career at Stanford by
being named first team Ail-Ameri
can by five different organizations
during the 2000 season, helping
Stanford reach the finals of the Col
lege World Series for the first time
since 1988.
He finished the 2000 campaign
by setting a new Stanford single
season record with 15 victories as
he posted a 15-4 record with a 3.21
ERA. He also recorded 163 strike
outs, the second highest single-sea
son total ever by a Cardinal pitcher.
His accomplishments included a se
lection as co-Pac-10 Pitcher of the

Year honor as he co-led the confer
ence in victories to rank tied for
third in the NCAA.
"Justin had a tremendous career
at Stanford and should be an excel
lent pitcher in professional base
ball," said Cardinal head coach
Mark Marquess.
Wayne will be assigned to the
Expos' Single-A affiliate, the
Jupiter Hammerheads, in the
Florida State League.
Walters signs with Vikings
Former Stanford All-America
wide receiver Troy Walters signed
a three-year contract with the Min
nesota Vikings, who had selected
him in the fifth round in April's
NFL Draft. The deal is worth
$919,500 over the three seasons in-

eluding a
$93,500 sign
ing bonus. Wal
ters will earn
$193,000 his
first season,
$275,000 his
second and
$358,000 in his
third.

Walters set numerous Stanford
and Pac-10 records during his time
on the Farm despite being only 5
feet 6 inches tall. Following his se
nior season, in which he caught 74
passes for 1,456 yards and scored
10 touchdowns, he received the
Biletnikoff Award, given annually

to college football's top receiver.
Although the Vikings are deep
at wideout, Walters is expected to
provide a change of pace as a small
er, shiftier receiver and also will
likely return kicks and play on spe
cial teams. The Vikings' training
camp begins July 23 in Mankato,
Minnesota.
Husak agrees to terms
with Redskins
Quarterback Todd Husak, who
led the Stanford football team to its
first Rose Bowl since 1972, signed a
two-year, $498,000 contract with

sixth round of the NFL draft.
Husak finished his career with
the Cardinal ranking high in every
major passing category: fifth in
passing yards (6,564), total offense
(6,428), touchdown passes (41)
and pass attempts (872) and sixth

in completions
(465). He holds
a Stanford
record lor pass
ing yards in a
game with 450
as a junior
against Oregon
Suite.
Redskins'

Maryland.
