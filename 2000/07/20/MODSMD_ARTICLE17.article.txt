# U.S. women splash Russia, 7-5
## 
### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Avery Aquatic Center's
Pool was a rough place to be last
Friday night.
There were flailing heads,
poking fingers and wayward
arms.
And that was only above the
surface.
The U.S. women's Olympic
water polo team out-bashed the
Russian Olympic team 7-5 in an
exhibition match held at Stanford
as a tuneup for the upcoming
Summer Olympics, which will
take over Sydney, Australia in
September.
Coralie Simmons proved to be
the difference for the United
States on offense, scoring three
times for the hat trick.
"Coralie Simmons has taken
her game to a whole new level.
She has always been one of the
better players in the world, but
the way she played at [last week
end's] Holiday Cup and the way
she has been playing has been
very strong," said U.S. head
coach Guy Baker.
While Simmons was leading
the charge on offense, goalies
Nicolle Payne and Bernice Orwig
helped hold the Russians down
on the defensive end. Combined
with a swarming, unrelenting
U.S. defense, the pair of netmin-

ders withstood 24
shots from Russia's
offense to keep the
United Stales out in
front.
Maureen O'Toole,
the 39-year-old won
der who rountinely
(aces opponents half
her age, added a goal
of her own during a 6-
on-5 in the second pe
riod with a deft left
handed shot that put
the United States up 3-
0. O'Toole, who once
upon a time was the
women's coach at UC-
Berkeley, thought
there was much room
for improvement.
"When it comes
down to it, that's the
game — 6-on-5,5-on
-6. Our 6-on-5 wasn't
great tonight. Had it
been great, we proba
bly would have won

by four or five goals," said
O'Toole.
Stanford was represented on
the squad by Ellen Estes and
Brenda Villa. Estes, who scored
in the second period, redshirted
the previous season after earning
All-America honors her first two
years on the Farm. The 20-year
old Villa, the most highly recruit
ed prep player in the history of

the sport, has yet to play for Stan
ford women's water polo coach
John Tanner due to national
team duties.
The game was attended by ap
proximately 1,800 fans, predomi
nantly teenage girls who cheered
wildly with every U.S. shot or de
fensive stop. The team will resume
practice next Monday in Los
Alamitos, where it will reside until
leaving for Sydney on Sept. 1.
