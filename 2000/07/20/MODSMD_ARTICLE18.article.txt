## X-Men jump from pages to screen 
### WILL TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I admit it, I'm a comic lxx>k fan.
Big time, in fact. There are two
rather large lx>xes in my room that
are full of comics and graphic nov
els. Not to mention the several
lxixes at my parents' house. I have
absolutely no problem with this.
There is more than enough evi
dence that can Ix- presented that
validates the medium as a literary
and graphical art form, and the fi
nancial success of the comic lxx)k
has never truly lx*en in question.
The crossover aspect of the
comic fcxx>k, however, has been one
of the genre's few black eyes. "Judge
Dredd" was dreadful. "Tank Girl"
tanked. Few people even know that
there ever were film versions of
"The Punisher," "Captain America"
or "The Fantastic Four" (be espe
cially thankful for this, trust me).
Even the films that were success
ful eventually degenerated into
abominations; "Superman" should
have ended after the first two, and 1
won't even talk about what hap
pened to the "Batman" franchise .
"Blade" remains the sole film nei
ther mangled in the initial or subse
quent releases. Not exactly the best
track record ever.
Thank the heavens for Bryan
Singer. The director, known and
acclaimed for"The Usual Suspects"
and "Apt Pupil," takes on a fairly
large challenge with the film "X-
Men." The mission: take an ensem
ble cast, as well as one of the best-sell
ing books in any genre of all time,
combine the two and make a sum
mer bl<x kbustei that will satisfy not

only an unforgiving comic lxx>k au
dience but people who are new to
the series as well. Easy, right?
Actually, yes. Singer makes it
look easy, anyway. "X-Men" is in
credible. It (K)zes smarts, sexiness
and action. It manages to do this
while remaining incredibly faithful
to the original comic series but not
to the point that it becomes silly.
The first intelligent thing Singer
does is to write an original story and
not draw from one of the pre-exist
ing lwK)k arcs. This would have led
to far too much analysis by purists,
and utter confusion by ingenues.
The new story blends more than
enough of the current mvthos,
while adding enough variation to
keep the story gtxxl (and the possi
bility for sequels open).
The story revolves around the
conflict between Charles Xavier
(plaved to absolute perfection by
Patrick Stewart) and Magneto, who
battle over their visions for the fu
ture. The men represent opposite
ends of the spectrum of the debate
on mutants, the next step in human
evolution.
In the world of the X-Men, mu
tants are feared by humans that
don't understand them, and hunt
ed by politicians who want to control
them. This particular battle revolves
around the desire of the govern
ment to pass a law that requires the
registration of mutants.
Magneto sees this as little more
than the barbarism that he dealt
with growing up in a concentration
camp during World War 11 and
kx)ks to take action against human
ity by mutating the world's leaders
at a IJ. N. function.

Sound implausible? Of course ii
is, this is a comic book. These are
built on the concept of suspension of
disbelief. If you want high drama,
go elsewhere. But don't make the
mistake of assuming that there is no
talent here.
In fact, talent abounds in the
characterizations and will surely be
built on in subsequent films (don't
think for a second that Fox wasn't
thinking franchise film all the way
here).
Hugh Jackman portrays
Wolverine, one of the most complex
characters in comics. Wolverine has
300 pounds of indestructible metal
grafted to his skeleton and a healing
factor that repairs his body almost as
soon as it is injured. Jackman is won
derful in the role, particularly in his
interactions with the X-Men's
leader Cyclops (deadpan ned to the
hilt by James Marsden) and Cy
clops' girlfriend Jean Grey (Famke
Jannsen). The playful tension be
tween Jackman and Jannsen is
beautiful, and his banter with Mars
den is great material as well.
Halle Berry plays Storm, whose
ability to manipulate the weather is
relegated mostly to lightning bolt
tossing. While the book character is
rather deep and involved, there is
little enough attention given the
windrider here, hopefully some
thing can be done about this the
next time around.
The delightful Anna Paquin por
trays Rogue, who becomes Wolver
ine's young charge. Her ability is
one of the more frightening, as she
absorbs the life energy of anyone
she touches flesh to flesh. What can
a gal do when her first kiss puts her

boyfriend in a three-week coma?
But an action movie requires vil
lains, and Magneto's Brotherhood
of Mutants is a cornucopia of bad
guy talents. What else can you ex
pect from a crew that has Darth
Maul (Ray Park) with a six-foot
prosthetic tongue (longer with the
help of CGI)?
Lan McKellen plays an adequate
Magneto, though he doesn't have
the opportunity to explore the psy
chological depths of the character.
Here is a man whose powers began
to manifest themselves in a Nazi
death camp. The ramifications of
this aren't explored, which is one of
the advantages of a serial b<x>k, but
are related to merely allegorical sig
nificance in the film.
McKellen is potent in his interac
tions with Stewart, as the Malcolm X
to Xavier's Martin Luther King.
Both men respect each other great
ly, but are determined to win the
human-mutant conflict by different
means.
Then there are Magneto's fellow
baddies. As mentioned, Ray Park
has a really big tongue. He plays the
Toad, a strange creature with a sar
donic grin on his face for most of the

film. Sabretooth, Wolverine's neat
est rival, is present as well, and their
battle lives up to some of the battles
they have gone through on paper
and the animated series.
And lastly, there is Rebecca
Romjin-Stamos as Mystique. For
the film, her body had to l:>e painted
completely blue, a process which av
eraged over three hours to com
plete every day.
The film is a romp, pure and sim
ple. The jokes are tart and reach an
excellent blend of inside jokes for
comic purists, side comments for
the adults in the audience and jokes
simple enough for the kids that are
going to go and buy all the film's
merchandise. I'm definitely going
to see it again and probably fall vic
tim to buying the merchandise as
well. Why not? It's summer, and a
film like this was designed for this
season.
