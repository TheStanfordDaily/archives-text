# "Chuck & Buck" all about fear and love
## 
### STACY WAGNER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Don't be fooled. Even though
"Chuck 8c Buck's" marketing team
advertises the film as the story of "an
infantile 27-year-old," this is no Jim
Carrey knock-off. It's true that nu
merous scenes are littered with lol
lipops and matchbox cars, but the
story is fundamentally about a con
fused young man (Buck) with a pa
thetically strong tie to the past and a
very loose grip on both the present
and future.
Mike White, who also wrote the
script, plays Buck, a funny looking
carrot top with lots of toys and sig
nificantly less loved ones. He has
lived with his mother for his entire
life and faces an immense reality
check when she dies at the start of

the movie. With Mom gone, Buck
thinks back to the only other person
whf) presumably loved him: his
childhood best friend Chuck (Chris
Weitz). After all, they had some great
sexual encounters together as 11-
year-old boys. If that's not love, what
is?
As a grown-up, Chuck defines
love, and living, somewhat different
ly. With a Tom Cruise profile and a
straight-on resemblance to Christo
pher Reeve, he's got his L.A image
down. He has a beautiful fiancee, a
silver BMW and a large house Buck
can only describe as "old people-y."
From the look of things, Chuck's
made it as a record company exec.
After his mother's funeral, Buck
moves to Los Angeles to be near
Chuck, who has since shed his child
hood nickname for the sleeker

"Charlie." Though Chuck repeated
ly puts on a friendly face for his old
pal, he makes it clear that the rela
tionship he once had with Buck is
never to be had again.
Lollipop sucking and ice cream
slurping Buck doesn't take rejection
quite as seriously as the future he
sees for himself and Chuck. Hang
ing out at the children's theatre
across the street from Chuck's office
building eventually rubs off on
Buck, who decides to write a play

paralleling his experience with
Chuck. If only the all-too-adult
Chuck could watch and remember
scenes from their joyous youth.
Buck believes that die two could re
sume the fun and "games" of dieir
boyhcKxl days.
Though the audience is constant
ly reminded of Buck's superficial
childishness through props such as a
vaporizer used nightly and a slinky
(rainbow colored and heart-shaped,
mind you), his struggles run much
deeper than deciding between hav
ing bologna or ham on a sandwich.
Buck not only has to come to grips
with an idealized past but also with

an identity crisis and a homosexual
urge that transforms him into an
outright stalker. (There's enough
oral fixation in this movie to put a
smile on Freud's cadaver.) The re
lentless emphasis on boyish clothes
and props takes away from the fact
diat Buck is already an adult. His
tears are produced by real angst. His
possessions may give the appear
ance of Romper Room, but inside
his head it's pure hell.
The movie's opening scene sets
the tone for the entire 95 minutes.
With Buck's mom incessantly hack
ing out her final coughs, you can't
help but crack up. As it continues,
you can't help but feel sick. There
are almost too many funny scenes in
this film in which those who con
front their feelings are borderline
insane and those who suppress

them are empty and hypocritical. I
couldn't wait to see how the conclu
sion would wrap everything up. But
I did wait, and so will you.
Each of the actors' performances
is beyond criticism. Lupe Ontiveros
as Beverly, the House Manager of
the children's theatre, provides ab
solutely great comic relief. "Chuck 8c
Buck," however, isn't the film for
those interested in light-hearted,
gross-out humor. Though director
Miguel Arteta claims that his mes
sage is essentially hopeful, that's the
most questionable aspect of this
Sundance standout.
If you've been longing for some
thing more along the lines of the
plays of Edward Albee, "Chuck 8c
Buck" will definitely make you think
about who, and what, you should be
afraid of.'
