# "Chuck & Buck" all about fear and love

### STACY WAGNER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Don't be fooled. Even though
"Chuck 8c Buck's" marketing team
advertises the film as the story of "an
infantile 27-year-old," this is no Jim
Carrey knock-off. It's true that nu
merous scenes are littered with lol
lipops and matchbox cars, but the
story is fundamentally about a con
fused young man (Buck) with a pa
thetically strong tie to the past and a
very loose grip on both the present
and future.
Mike White, who also wrote the
script, plays Buck, a funny looking
carrot top with lots of toys and sig
nificantly less loved ones. He has
lived with his mother for his entire
life and faces an immense reality
check when she dies at the start of

the movie. With Mom gone, Buck
thinks back to the only other person
whf) presumably loved him: his
childhood best friend Chuck (Chris
Weitz). After all, they had some great
sexual encounters together as 11-
year-old boys. If that's not love, what
is?
As a grown-up, Chuck defines
love, and living, somewhat different
ly. With a Tom Cruise profile and a
straight-on resemblance to Christo
pher Reeve, he's got his L.A image
down. He has a beautiful fiancee, a
silver BMW and a large house Buck
can only describe as "old people-y."
From the look of things, Chuck's
made it as a record company exec.
After his mother's funeral, Buck
moves to Los Angeles to be near
Chuck, who has since shed his child
hood nickname for the sleeker

"Charlie." Though Chuck repeated
ly puts on a friendly face for his old
pal, he makes it clear that the rela
tionship he once had with Buck is
never to be had again.
Lollipop sucking and ice cream
slurping Buck doesn't take rejection
quite as seriously as the future he
sees for himself and Chuck. Hang
ing out at the children's theatre
across the street from Chuck's office
building eventually rubs off on
Buck, who decides to write a play
