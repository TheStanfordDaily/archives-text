# Summer "Godot" is thought-provoking
## 
### MONYA DE EDITORIAL STAFF 
For a play so often referenced,
quoted and analyzed, "Waiting for
Godot" is surprisingly seldom per
formed in the Bay Area. Perhaps
the very inscrutability that makes it
such a juicy classroom text is too
daunting for the directors and ac
tors. Perhaps its un-crowd pleas
ing action screams box office loss
es. Whatever the reason, "Godot,"
when it is reincarnated, plays mind
games with its audience, slipping
away just as a joke seems to render
the text accessible.
In Stanford Summer Theater's
current production, a team of solid

actors stays true to absurdist the
ater, performing with zeal and
penetrating Samuel Beckett's
opaque fortress of a play. Jarek
Truszczynski as Gogo and Geoff
Hoyle as Didi play two men who
wait eternally beside a tree for a
mysterious man named Godot. As
the night falls each passing day, the
events that marked the passage of
time seem to fade and time seems
to be caught in an infinite loop.
Hoyle and Truszczynski play
off each other quite naturally.
They get tangled up physically in
one of the play's many comic mo
ments, as well as getting tangled
up in words and ideas. Hoyle, in
particular, steals the show with the antics of his rub
ber body. He's a former Cirque du Soleil clown, and
it shows. 1 le is so full of his character that he seems
about to explode with energy at any moment.
The Drama Department's Rush Rehm then
bursts onto stage as Pozzo, a man who is heading to
a fair to sell his slave, Lucky (Geoff Sobelle). Pozzo
proceeds to engage in debate of questionable s\ m
bolism with the two men waiting for Godot. Pozzo
and Lucky are rooted in routine, dependent on
each other, and Didi and Gogo protest the mas
ter/slave relationship to no avail. Even Lucky's
thinking is regulated bv Pozzo's command to
"THINK!" This word triggers a long, rapid-fire, in
comprehensible monologue of snippets from texts,
speeches and thoughts from Lucky. Sobelle's per
formance here was incredible; the audience lis
tened breathlessly and wide-eyed as he performed
the monologue.
Truszczynski has designed a beautiful and mod
ern set similar in concept to the style of the opening
scenes of "2001The solitary tree is striking against
the deep blue "sky", the sun- and moonrises are
otherworldly, and the textured ground surface cre
ates a neutral setting fitting for the universality of
the characters and themes.
