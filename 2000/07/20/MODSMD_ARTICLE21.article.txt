# Indigo Girls back with "Come On Now Social"
## 
### MONYA DE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Somehow, for 10 years running,
Emily Saliers and Amy Ray have
managed to turn out solid album
after album of folksy acoustic gui
tar-driven music, seemingly effort
less harmonizing and multilayered
lyrics. The result has been a mas
sive following ranging from people
who take guitar lessons upon hear
ing "Joking," college students who
sing "Closer to Fine" around
campfires and people who listen to
"Ghost" upon becoming victims of
unrequited love. Now, in the wake
of the hugely successful Lilith Fair
summer tours with Sarah Maclach
lan, the Indigo Girls have re
vamped their sound with "Come
On Now Social."
Each 1G album features the
duo's trademark techniques, but
every album they come out with
also contains something new.
"Come On Now Social" is no ex
ception. With Ray's hard-hitting
rock anthems complementing
Saliers'joyous sing-alongs and re
flective musings and lots of musi
cal and lyrical risk-taking in be
tween, the album has something
for the casual listener as well as
the diehard fan.
The album's title refers to a
lyric that, Ray says, is her talking
to herself, telling herself to be
strong and stand up for the caus
es she believes in. The Indigos are
known for their politics almost as
much as their music, and "Come
on Now Social" takes a surpris
ingly blunt approach to politics.
Lyrics such as "And when the

clergy take a vote all the gays will
pay again" are found all over the
album, while previous songs
tended to lean more toward the
subtly inscrutable. In the album's
first call to action, "Go," the
album's opener, blasts you out of
your seat with its heavy-handed
dose of electric guitar, throbbing
bass and in-your-face command
to "Don't take a seat/Don't stand
aside."
Saliers is blessed with one of
the sweetest voices on the air
waves, and she tells both sad and
happy stories beautifully. "Peace
Tonight," which has already seen
considerable playing time on
many radio stations, is the song to
sing on road trips with the top
down. The song would have been
great with just the girls' voices,
guitars and backing rhythm, but
the gutsy addition of big-band
sounds makes it a get-up-and
dance number.
Saliers' other songs are in
fused with as much frustration as
Ray's but with a different musical
effect. Her "Gold Beer and Re
mote Control" is American
Dream despair in a major key, an
infectious rock 'n' roll antithesis
to Tracy Chapman's languorous
yet hopeful "Fast Car." "Soon to
be Nothing" tells the tale of a
woman hanging on to the last bits
of a relationship, and "Trouble"
is unrest and dissatisfaction rolled
into a song ("Get to the point of
it/get to the sense of it").
The CD, like Lilith Fair itself , is
truly a "celebration of women in
music." After such Lilith collabo
rations as the song "Water is

Wide," with Jewel and Sarah
Maclachlan, the Indigo Girls are
continuing to share the spotlight
with famous friends. Sheryl Crow
guest stars on "Cold Beer and Re
mote Control," and Me' Shell
Ndegeocello's bass is heard on
"We Are Together." Chameleon
cellist Caroline Dale, a member of
Ghostland, the backing band on
"Come On Now Social," handles
rock songs and ballads uniformly
well. Dale, whose artistry is heard
during Emily Watson's bow
synching concert scenes in the
film "Hilary and Jackie," provides
a musical translation of the ache
in the Girls' lyrics. Rock goddess
Joan Osborne's voice adds a hon
eyed yet sinister layer to "Trou
ble," much like her work on Blues
Traveler's debut album, and
sings on many other tracks.
Many of the songs introduce a
single natural or synthesized
sound, then layer new ones faster
and faster until they meld into a
rich backdrop for the voices and
lead guitar part. This works espe
cially well on Ray's "Ozziline," a
song about her grandmother.
The grandmother's speaking
voice is heard alone, then slides
right under the emerging percus
sion until she seems to be inten
tionally speaking in time with the
beat. It's a clever and unique ef
fect.
There seem to be a few nods to
other artists on the album,
whether intentional or coinciden
tal. "Andy," Saliers' story of a
country girl in love with an obliv
ious boy, reminded me of Queen
sryche's "Silent Lucidity," and

Ray's "Compro
mise" resurrected
parts of Nirvana's
"Breed."
Ray's ferocity
resurfaces in the
final song, "Faye
Tucker." "Faye
Tucker" is the most
defining moment
in the Indigo Girls'
reinvention of
their music. It ex
ists as a brilliant ex
perimental synthe
sis of the haunting
wails of Middle
Eastern singer
Natacha Atlas, the
Celtic roots of
Ghostland, Ap
palachian influ
ence and a brazen

testimony against the death
penalty. Karla Faye Tucker was
the first woman executed in
Texas since the Civil War, and the
Indigo Girls tell her story in plain
language ("Roll out the head of
Faye Tucker") backed by the lush
accordion playing of Carol Isaacs.
Atlas, a vocal dead ringer for the
late Ofra Haza, is incorporated
into the song in a way that needs
no explanation. In another snub
to the four-minute pop song,
"Faye Tucker" doesn't end, it just
sort of fades away, just as contro
versy fades and resurfaces with
out resolution. There is a mini
bonus tucked away at the end of
"Faye." Just when you think the
song has ended, Saliers and Ray
reprise some of the earlier songs,
but with different lyrics certain to

make you stop in your tracks.
The Indigo Girls are set to play
Berkeley's Greek Theatre on July
22, and their tradition of unique
rapport with their audiences
promises an engaging and mem
orable show. Personally, I will be
looking for the Girls to shed some
of the studio gloss on their new
songs and unleash the sum total
of the restless energy within
them. Until Saturday, I'm going
to have "Cold Beer and Remote
Control" on repeat in my CD
player.

penalty. Karla Faye Tucker was
the first woman executed in
Texas since the Civil War, and the
Indigo Girls tell her story in plain
language ("Roll out the head of
Faye Tucker") backed by the lush
accordion playing of Carol Isaacs.
Atlas, a vocal dead ringer for the
late Ofra Haza, is incorporated
into the song in a way that needs
no explanation. In another snub
to the four-minute pop song,
"Faye Tucker" doesn't end, it just
sort of fades away, just as contro
versy fades and resurfaces with
out resolution. There is a mini
bonus tucked away at the end of
"Faye." Just when you think the
song has ended, Saliers and Ray
reprise some of the earlier songs,
but with different lyrics certain to

make you stop in your tracks.
The Indigo Girls are set to play
Berkeley's Greek Theatre on July
22, and their tradition of unique
rapport with their audiences
promises an engaging and mem
orable show. Personally, I will be
looking for the Girls to shed some
of the studio gloss on their new
songs and unleash the sum total
of the restless energy within
them. Until Saturday, I'm going
to have "Cold Beer and Remote
Control" on repeat in my CD
player.

The Indigo Girls' new album delivers a mix of the old and new.

Somehow, for 10 years running,
Emily Saliers and Amy Ray have
managed to turn out solid album
after album of folksy acoustic gui
tar-driven music, seemingly effort
less harmonizing and multilayered
lyrics. The result has been a mas
sive following ranging from people
who take guitar lessons upon hear
ing "Joking," college students who
sing "Closer to Fine" around
campfires and people who listen to
"Ghost" upon becoming victims of
unrequited love. Now, in the wake
of the hugely successful Lilith Fair
summer tours with Sarah Maclach
lan, the Indigo Girls have re
vamped their sound with "Come
On Now Social."
Each 1G album features the
duo's trademark techniques, but
every album they come out with
also contains something new.
"Come On Now Social" is no ex
ception. With Ray's hard-hitting
rock anthems complementing
Saliers'joyous sing-alongs and re
flective musings and lots of musi
cal and lyrical risk-taking in be
tween, the album has something
for the casual listener as well as
the diehard fan.
The album's title refers to a
lyric that, Ray says, is her talking
to herself, telling herself to be
strong and stand up for the caus
es she believes in. The Indigos are
known for their politics almost as
much as their music, and "Come
on Now Social" takes a surpris
ingly blunt approach to politics.
Lyrics such as "And when the

clergy take a vote all the gays will
pay again" are found all over the
album, while previous songs
tended to lean more toward the
subtly inscrutable. In the album's
first call to action, "Go," the
album's opener, blasts you out of
your seat with its heavy-handed
dose of electric guitar, throbbing
bass and in-your-face command
to "Don't take a seat/Don't stand
aside."
Saliers is blessed with one of
the sweetest voices on the air
waves, and she tells both sad and
happy stories beautifully. "Peace
Tonight," which has already seen
considerable playing time on
many radio stations, is the song to
sing on road trips with the top
down. The song would have been
great with just the girls' voices,
guitars and backing rhythm, but
the gutsy addition of big-band
sounds makes it a get-up-and
dance number.
Saliers' other songs are in
fused with as much frustration as
Ray's but with a different musical
effect. Her "Gold Beer and Re
mote Control" is American
Dream despair in a major key, an
infectious rock 'n' roll antithesis
to Tracy Chapman's languorous
yet hopeful "Fast Car." "Soon to
be Nothing" tells the tale of a
woman hanging on to the last bits
of a relationship, and "Trouble"
is unrest and dissatisfaction rolled
into a song ("Get to the point of
it/get to the sense of it").
The CD, like Lilith Fair itself , is
truly a "celebration of women in
music." After such Lilith collabo
rations as the song "Water is

Wide," with Jewel and Sarah
Maclachlan, the Indigo Girls are
continuing to share the spotlight
with famous friends. Sheryl Crow
guest stars on "Cold Beer and Re
mote Control," and Me' Shell
Ndegeocello's bass is heard on
"We Are Together." Chameleon
cellist Caroline Dale, a member of
Ghostland, the backing band on
"Come On Now Social," handles
rock songs and ballads uniformly
well. Dale, whose artistry is heard
during Emily Watson's bow
synching concert scenes in the
film "Hilary and Jackie," provides
a musical translation of the ache
in the Girls' lyrics. Rock goddess
Joan Osborne's voice adds a hon
eyed yet sinister layer to "Trou
ble," much like her work on Blues
Traveler's debut album, and
sings on many other tracks.
Many of the songs introduce a
single natural or synthesized
sound, then layer new ones faster
and faster until they meld into a
rich backdrop for the voices and
lead guitar part. This works espe
cially well on Ray's "Ozziline," a
song about her grandmother.
The grandmother's speaking
voice is heard alone, then slides
right under the emerging percus
sion until she seems to be inten
tionally speaking in time with the
beat. It's a clever and unique ef
fect.
There seem to be a few nods to
other artists on the album,
whether intentional or coinciden
tal. "Andy," Saliers' story of a
country girl in love with an obliv
ious boy, reminded me of Queen
sryche's "Silent Lucidity," and

Ray's "Compro
mise" resurrected
parts of Nirvana's
"Breed."
Ray's ferocity
resurfaces in the
final song, "Faye
Tucker." "Faye
Tucker" is the most
defining moment
in the Indigo Girls'
reinvention of
their music. It ex
ists as a brilliant ex
perimental synthe
sis of the haunting
wails of Middle
Eastern singer
Natacha Atlas, the
Celtic roots of
Ghostland, Ap
palachian influ
ence and a brazen

testimony against the death
penalty. Karla Faye Tucker was
the first woman executed in
Texas since the Civil War, and the
Indigo Girls tell her story in plain
language ("Roll out the head of
