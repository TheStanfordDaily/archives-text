# Bobby McFerrin charms San Fran audience

### MELISSA GROSSARTH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Picture a beautiful summer afternoon
in the Sharon Meadow of Golden Gate
Park: the sun is shining, people are play
ing lawn games, others are lying on blan
kets soaking up the rays or enjoying a pic
nic with family and friends. Behind all of
this activity, you hear the most beautiful
melodies of Prokofiev's No. 1. Amazing, is
it not? This image was a reality for the
more than 1,000 people who attended the
San Francisco Symphony's concert, con
ducted by Bobby McFerrin, on July 9.
In an ode to youth and beauty, the
concert delighted the audience with
beautiful music, a simple but effective
stage and an enthusiastic orchestra. And,
as a special treat, Bobby McFerrin, per
formed a very fun and witty improvisa
tion set that seemed to brighten the
smiles on all faces.
The music chosen for the afternoon's
festivities was absolutely perfect in na
ture. It was upbeat, punchy, energetic
and had the power to drive the imagina
tion. For example, Gershwin's "An Amer
ican in Paris" is a piece filled with the
wonder, excitement, and intrigue that

leads one to think of cartoon characters
prancing around a screen of color and
light, similar to what is seen and heard in
the Disney movie "Fantasia." Coinciden
tal!), this sort of imagery was present in
the second part of the concert due to the
flutter of trumpets, sweeping melody of
violins and dancing sounds of flutes in
Duka's "The Sorcerer's Apprentice."
This piece is actually the one that "Fanta
sia" is most recognized for.
The music of Ravel's "Riganudon" and
Rimsky-Korsakov's "Capriccio espagnol"
also expressed energy to move the listen
er. However, it was done so in a slightly
different manner. Ravel's piece expressed
quick violin lines, grand drum beats and a
sweet oboe melody that enchanted and
soothed the listener, whereas Rimsky-Ko
rsakov's piece was powered by moving
rhythms that caused one to want to get up
and dance (a grand finale for a grand per
formance). The melodies of all the pieces
were as carefree as the hearts that came to
hear them.
Not only did McFerrin enthusiastical
ly lead the orchestra by dancing with the
music and by driving his arms into the
tempo changes, but he also sent the au
dience into bursts of laughter with his

antics. He was able to connect with the
children and the child in every one of us
with his complex a capella rhythms and
vocals. 1 found myself wondering how
one man can produce so many different
sounds without using any actual instru
ments. No orchestra, no problem! The
basis of most of his improv was the audi
ence itself. McFerrin would scan the
crowd for someone interesting, such as a
man wearing a cowboy hat or a little boy
walking behind his mother, and then
began to sing a song about that person,
adding sound effects, rhythm and comi
cal verses.
McFerrin was certainly not averse to
sharing the stage with others, especially
not his own daughter, who came up on to
the stage to surprise the crowd with her
talent in singing the theme song from the
"Winnie the Pooh," which inspired Mc-
Ferrin to end the improv set with a twist
ing medley from the movie "The Wizard
of Oz." McFerrin asked for audience par
ticipation in singing "Follow the Yellow
Brick Road" and "Somewhere Over the
Rainbow." All in all, everyone seemed to
be happy to be welcomed to "Munchkin
land" and back to his or her childhood
memories.
