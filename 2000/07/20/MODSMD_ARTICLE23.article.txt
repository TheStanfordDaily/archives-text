# Uncle Kracker doesn't impress in solo debut

Movies and television have a long history
built on the concept of the spin-off series.
When you have a hit film or show, the stan
dard operating procedure is to bleed it until
the well is dry. Sometimes there are successes.
Most of the time there are miserable failures.
What some people don't realize is that
music operates in much the same manner.
"Hie second a group is successful any label will
automatically start looking for anything simi
lar to it. The hope is that the genre can be rid
den until the cow stops giving milk. 98 De
grees can thank the Backstreet Boys lor any
money in their IRAs. Britney Spears should
have a shrine somewhere in her bedroom to
the memory of Debbie Gibson.
The rap metal phenomena is no exception,
limp Bizk.it would be even more limp without
Korn before it. Kid Rock may have paid his
dues, but he also would still be paying them
now if Fred Durst, Jonathon Davis and others

hadn't blazed first.
Now comes Uncle Kracker, the DJ who lays
down the hip hop stylings for Kid Rock. Un
fortunately, while Kid Rock definitely has
something resembling talent, or at least the
ability to rock the party, Uncle Kracker does
not. His "Double Wide" is a vanity project, the
result of someone's belief that they could pos
sibly spin the success of Kid Rwk into a pet
project.
The result is a number of tracks that, while
musically interesting at times, are on the
whole rather confused. Uncle Kracker isn't
sure what it wants to be and as a result comes
off sounding rather false.
The track "Follow Me" is perhaps the most
telling of the album because it's where Krack
er's writing abilities and flow are most exposed
and least effective. When Uncle goes down
home is when he begs to be pulled from the
CD player.
The inevitable guest spot by the Kid follows
on "Heaven," a strange hoe-down of a song.

Kracker's toughness doesn't help him on this CD.
