### DENNIS TYLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
After a long, anticipated wait, Robin Mam
let has been named as the new dean of admis
sions and financial aid.
According to members of the search com
mittee that selected her, Mamlet's experience
and expertise in admissions made her an ex
cellent choice lor the position.
"Robin Mamlet is a star in the field, known
for her bold thinking, her uncommon com
mitment to undergraduate education and lib
eral learning and her love of working with
students," said James Montoya, Vice Provost
of Student Affairs and co-chair of the search
committee. "Robin Mamlet will bring to Stan
ford a deep understanding of highly selective
college admission and need-blind admis
sion," he added.
"She is very adept at dealing with all the
constituencies involved: prospective stu
dents, parents, staff and faculty. She will
bring a real human approach to her work
and genuine interest in helping to make
Stanford the best it can be," said Harry
Elam, associate professor of drama and
member of the search committee.
According to Montoya, the process for
choosing the new dean was not an easy task. It
required a lot of hard work and commitment

from the search committee.
"The committee reviewed more than 40
resumes, interviewed by phone 10 applicants
and interviewed a small group of finalists on
campus. Three candidates were invited back
to campus to meet with University President
Gerhard Casper and Provost John Hen
nessy," said Montoya.
Mamlet will be succeeding Robert Kinnal
ly, who at the end of this month will be leaving
Stanford to enter St John's Fisher Seminary
in Stamford, Conn, to begin his studies to
ward ordination as a priest of the Roman
Catholic Church.
Mamlet is confident and hopeful that she
will continue the progress that Kinnally has
made while at Stanford.
"1 hope to build on the exceptional job
Bob Kinnally and his gifted staff have done
in attracting to the University the wonder
fully bright, talented and intellectually en
gaged students who are so well-matched
for Stanford," said Robin Mamlet in the
Stanford Report.
Because of Kinnally's tremendous success,
Mamlet will have her work cut out for her.
Kinnally and his staff strove to put the
focus on intellectual achievement while re
viewing applications. He has also restruc
tured the financial aid process, making Stan
ford more affordable to students.

Kinnally concedes, however, that regard
less of the procedural changes one makes, the
key to being successful at Stanford is main
taining communication.
His advice to Mamlet is "to connect with
students by going to their dorms and having
dinner with them. It's really important to
keep open lines of communication with these
future leaders."
Mamlet has a lot of experience with the ad
missions process. Since July of 1996, she has
been the dean of admissions at Swarthmore
College. Prior to that, she was dean of admis
sion at The Lawrenceville School in New Jer
sey from 1993-96. She spent six years at Sarah
Lawrence College in New York, first as direc
tor of admissions from 1987-91, then as dean
of admissions and financial aid from 1991 -93.
Born and raised in Santa Barbara, Calif., in
1982 Mamlet began her admission career at
Occidental College in Los Angeles, where she
earned a bachelor's in English and minor in
psychology. Then she went ahead to become
associate director of admissions at Pomona
College in Claremont, Calif., from 1984-87.
According to Stanford administrators,
Mamlet's experience ranks her among the
best qualified applicants for the new dean
of admissions.
"Robin has a lot of experience in leading
.an admissions office. She has a strong com

mitment to, and experience with, need-blind
admissions as well as a passion for finding stu
dents that will bring intellectual vitality to
Stanford," said Hennessy. "Additionally,
Robin understands and is committed to fos
tering diversity throughout the University."
Montoya agrees that "Mamlet will bring to
Stanford a deep understanding of highly se
lective college admissions and need-blind ad
mission. .Although the volume is significantly
larger at Stanford, the intensity of the selec -
tion process at Swarthmore is similar to that of
Stanford's."
fn October, she and her husband will be
moving out to California. Her husband,
Charles Brown, will become director of med
ical development at Stanford according to
Jacquelyn Brown, the associate vice president
for development and alumni affairs at Stan
ford Medical Center.
When asked what steps the University will
take to make Mamlet's transition from
Swarthmore as smooth as possible, Vice
Provost of Undergraduate Education John
Bravman replied that "the transition has al
ready begun with Mamlet, Montoya and Kin
nally holding extended meetings."
"Robin is so talented that I do not be
lieve there will be any difficulties in the
transition," he said. "She understands
Stanford verv well alreadv."
