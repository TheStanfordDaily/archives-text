# Stanford faces third harrassment case
## 
### WENDY ONG 
The case of Dr. Amrita Dosanjh, a for
mer staff physician in pediatrics at the
Lucile Packard Children's Hospital,
marks the third sexual harassment case
filed by The American Association of Uni
versity Women Legal Advocacy Fund
(LAF) against Stanford University.
"We are concerned that a pattern of
discrimination is operating on the cam
pus of Stanford University," said Sylvia'
Newman, LAF President. "[Stanford]
needs to be proactive in taking action to
stop discriminatory behaviors toward
women."
This comes after past sex and discrim
ination lawsuits by former Religious
Studies Prof. Diana Paul and former
medical informatics senior research sci
entist Colleen Crangle. Paul settled out of
court in March of this year, and a unani
mous jury awarded Crangle the maxi
mum amount ($545,000) allowed under
federal law for punitive and compensato
ry damages.
Dr. Dosanjh, the only non-white
physician in the Pediatric Pulmonary Di
vision, cited discrimination based on gen
der, race and national origin as the rea
sons for her contract not being renewed
in February of 1998. Dosanjh alleged
"harassment in employment" and harass
ing comments from the acting director to
possible future employers as well as to
others in the field of medicine following
her termination.

Among Dosanjh's charges against
Stanford and its School of Medicine are
accusations of a hostile work environ
ment, being paid a salary less than her co
workers, failure to promote or re-appoint
her and repeated disparaging comments
made about her professionalism.
The AAUW press release states that a
month after receiving "indications of re
newed employment and salary increase
from her superiors in July of 1997,"
Dosanjh was informed that her position
as a clinical assistant professor would not
be renewed.
In a past lawsuit filed with the Santa
Clara County Superior Court, Dosanjh
pinpointed Pediatrics Prof. Richard Moss
as a defendant, saying Moss "engaged in
behavior designed to harass and intimi
date [her], including impeding her re
search efforts, embarrassing her in front
of other physicians, nurses and other
medical personnel and preventing her
from doing the duties she was hired to
perform."
However, acting Stanford counsel
Debra Zumwatt pointed out that "this is
not the first time she has sued her em
ployer," making reference to a children's
hospital in Orange County where Dr.
Dosanjh worked.
Dr. Dosanjh's "fixed term appointment
had expired and was not renewed for...
performance reasons," said Zumwatt.
"Dr. Dosanjh was given an additional
six-month appointment after her origi
nal contract's expiration," said Zumwatt,

suggesting that she was not dismissed un
expectedly. Theoretically, "Stanford
does not even have to give a reason for
why a contract is not renewed," said
Zumwatt.
A motion filed by Stanford is pending
against Dosanjh for the return of confi
dential medical records, including some
that do not cover Dr. Dosanjh's patients.
Dr. Dosanjh approached the LAF for
their support following documents filed
with the Santa Clara County Superior
Court in 1998 and complaints to the Cal
ifornia Department of Fair Fmployment
and Housing and the California State
court. Having assessed the case's proba
bility of success, the plaintiffs need for fi
nancial aid and the potential significance
of the case for women in higher educa
tion, the LAF Board of Directors accept
ed Dosanjh's case this spring.
Sometimes monetary limitations can
prevent women from taking litigation
through to its conclusion, and this is
where the LAF steps in. Aside from the
obvious financial assistance it can provide
for its clients, the LAF provides emotion
al support, as well as aid in finding quali
fied witnesses, and a network of attorneys
and social workers who specialize in the
field of discrimination. The LAF itself
does not engage in litigation.
Dosan jh's case is part of a larger inves
tigation of Stanford by the U.S. Depart
ment of Labor for unfair business prac
tices. Dosanjh v. Stanford University is
expected to go to trial in September.
