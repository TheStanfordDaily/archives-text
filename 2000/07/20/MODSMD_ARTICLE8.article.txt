# EPA police dept. still under fire
## 
### GREG BRAZEAL EDITORIAL STAFF 
Following a demonstration Monday evening
outside East Palo Alto's City Hall against the al
leged injustice of the EPA Police Department, pro
testers and supporters of the department spoke out
at the City Council's general meeting.
The demonstration was led by a coalition of East
Palo Alto residents calling themselves Citizens for
East Palo Alto (CEPA) and was supported by Citi
zens Tribunal Inc., a San Jose police watch agency.
Central among the issues dividing demonstrators
and defenders of the department was the perfor
mance of Police Chief Wesley Bowling, who has led
the force since Dec. 1994. Cary Wood, a San Jose
resident who helped organize the demonstration,
argued that a police force of 32 officers is like a mil
itary organization: all the power is at the top.
"He's had five years to set his standard," Wood
said. "It's time for a higher standard . . . The buck
stops there."
During the meeting, many long-time East Palo
Alto residents voiced their support for Bowling,
frequently citing a drop in crime and murder rates
since Bowling stepped in. One 45-year resident ac
cused CEPA of being run by outsiders, calling them
"carpetbaggers." At CEPA's last demonstration, a
public meeting on June 14 that drew about 50 peo
ple, the San Mateo County Times quoted 34-year
resident Clarence Thomas as saying, "I feel that
Chief
Bowling
is the
best
thing

that happened to East Palo Alto."
Speaking before the Mayor and Coun
cil, Wood tried to refute the notion that
CEPA does not represent the views of East
Palo Alto's citizens. He also said that when
he first tried talking to residents about the
police force, "the citizens of East Palo Alto
were so intimidated that we were meeting
in the back of garages in the dark of night."
In addition to the ouster of Bowling,
CEPA demands the reinstatement of Sgt.
Robert Cole, who was fired in Jan. 1999 for
alleged insubordination. According to the
Palo Alto Daily News, Cole claims that he
was fired for exposing corruption in the
department, in particular the brutality of a
group of officers calling themselves the
"Wolf Pack" who branded each other with
heated coat hangers as an initiation rite.
"Basically I terminted Sgt. Cole because
there were a series of charges against him,"
said City Manager Monika Hudson, "and
there were more that were true than un
true." She added that Cole had been disci
plined for similar charges in the past.
After an appelate court ruled against
him, Cole filed an appeal with the state
Supreme Court. He has also filed a civil
suit against city and police officials, saying
that he was punished for being a whistle
blower.
In addition to Cole's lawsuits, the city
faces litigation from three women who
claim they were groped by officer Shawn
Wildman. Two teenagers say Wildman
groped them after pulling over their car on

Highway 101, and the third woman alleges
that Wildman groped her during a visit to
her house during an investigation. Wild
man has since been fired.
Bowling is quoted in the San Mateo
County Times as saying that he personally
brought Wildman's case to the attention of
the District Attorney's office when it be
came apparent to him that criminal
charges were warranted, but Gary Wood
disputed this at Monday's rally.
"He lies," Wood said. "Bowling refused
to take Wildman's molestation case to the
DA." Wood also said that Bowling recently
promoted an officer to sergeant who lost a
$100,000 sexual harrasment suit.
The strongest accusation of police bru
tality to emerge from CEPA's June 14
meeting was raised by Elaine Crooks. Ac
cording to the Palo Alto Weekly, Crooks
told the audience that police officers beat
her son, Dellory, in front of her following a
low-speed car chase, after he was already in
handcuffs.
"I said, 'Please don't kill my son, let him
go,' " Crooks is quoted as saying. "They
said, 'These are new billy clubs, and you're
the first we're using them on.' "
Dellory Crooks filed a complaint at the
police department the day after the inci
dent, March 29, signed by 18 witnesses. At
Monday's demonstration, 31-year resident
Maybelle Culps said that the police depart
ment "swept everything under the rug."
The case is still under investigation.
"There are a lot of witnesses," City Man
ager Hudson said, "but I believe there's
been some difficulty in getting Mr. Crooks
to come forward with . . . the situation."
CEPA also wants to make the complaint
process more accessible. Salas distributed

forms during Monday's demonstration to
anyone who felt they had been treated un
justly by the police. Complaint forms are
currently available in the City Manager's
office as well as the police department, but
some residents feel intimidated by the
process.
"They are somewhat intimidating the
way that they're put together right now,"
Hudson admitted. "They have the 're
quired advisory warning,' . . . which re
minds people what the penalties are if they
are fraudulently, frivolously filing their

complaint."
CEPA's final demand is
the reinstitution of the
Human Resources Com
mission (HRC), a four-per
son panel of volunteers
created by the City Council
to hear employee griev
ances. The Council dis
solved the HRC" shortly
after a March 2 hearing re
garding Robert Cole dur
ing which the panel sug
gested Cole be reinstated.
According to a May 5
administrative report,
HRC members displayed
"inappropriate conduct"
at Cole's hearing. A letter
sent to the four commis
sioners on April 5
charged the panel with
having "reached a deci
sion without thoroughly
reviewing the material
prepared by the city at
torney," and meeting
with Cole's attorney in

private and without City Attorney Michael
Lawson present.
The Council sent each commissioner a
letter on April 15 inviting them to a closed
session meeting April 19. After none ap
peared, the HRC was officially dissolved in
Oct. 1999.
A recent organizational study and full
scale audit of the police department by
President Clinton's former community
policing czar, Joe Brann, is due to be dis
cussed by the council in a closed session
meeting July 26.

Following a demonstration Monday evening
outside East Palo Alto's City Hall against the al
leged injustice of the EPA Police Department, pro
testers and supporters of the department spoke out
at the City Council's general meeting.
The demonstration was led by a coalition of East
Palo Alto residents calling themselves Citizens for
East Palo Alto (CEPA) and was supported by Citi
zens Tribunal Inc., a San Jose police watch agency.
Central among the issues dividing demonstrators
and defenders of the department was the perfor
mance of Police Chief Wesley Bowling, who has led
the force since Dec. 1994. Cary Wood, a San Jose
resident who helped organize the demonstration,
argued that a police force of 32 officers is like a mil
itary organization: all the power is at the top.
"He's had five years to set his standard," Wood
said. "It's time for a higher standard . . . The buck
stops there."
During the meeting, many long-time East Palo
Alto residents voiced their support for Bowling,
frequently citing a drop in crime and murder rates
since Bowling stepped in. One 45-year resident ac
cused CEPA of being run by outsiders, calling them
"carpetbaggers." At CEPA's last demonstration, a
public meeting on June 14 that drew about 50 peo
ple, the San Mateo County Times quoted 34-year
resident Clarence Thomas as saying, "I feel that
Chief
Bowling
is the
best
thing

that happened to East Palo Alto."
Speaking before the Mayor and Coun
cil, Wood tried to refute the notion that
CEPA does not represent the views of East
Palo Alto's citizens. He also said that when
he first tried talking to residents about the
police force, "the citizens of East Palo Alto
were so intimidated that we were meeting
in the back of garages in the dark of night."
In addition to the ouster of Bowling,
CEPA demands the reinstatement of Sgt.
Robert Cole, who was fired in Jan. 1999 for
alleged insubordination. According to the
Palo Alto Daily News, Cole claims that he
was fired for exposing corruption in the
department, in particular the brutality of a
group of officers calling themselves the
"Wolf Pack" who branded each other with
heated coat hangers as an initiation rite.
"Basically I terminted Sgt. Cole because
there were a series of charges against him,"
said City Manager Monika Hudson, "and
there were more that were true than un
true." She added that Cole had been disci
plined for similar charges in the past.
After an appelate court ruled against
him, Cole filed an appeal with the state
Supreme Court. He has also filed a civil
suit against city and police officials, saying
that he was punished for being a whistle
blower.
In addition to Cole's lawsuits, the city
faces litigation from three women who
claim they were groped by officer Shawn
Wildman. Two teenagers say Wildman
groped them after pulling over their car on

Highway 101, and the third woman alleges
that Wildman groped her during a visit to
her house during an investigation. Wild
man has since been fired.
Bowling is quoted in the San Mateo
County Times as saying that he personally
brought Wildman's case to the attention of
the District Attorney's office when it be
came apparent to him that criminal
charges were warranted, but Gary Wood
disputed this at Monday's rally.
"He lies," Wood said. "Bowling refused
to take Wildman's molestation case to the
DA." Wood also said that Bowling recently
promoted an officer to sergeant who lost a
$100,000 sexual harrasment suit.
The strongest accusation of police bru
tality to emerge from CEPA's June 14
meeting was raised by Elaine Crooks. Ac
cording to the Palo Alto Weekly, Crooks
told the audience that police officers beat
her son, Dellory, in front of her following a
low-speed car chase, after he was already in
handcuffs.
"I said, 'Please don't kill my son, let him
go,' " Crooks is quoted as saying. "They
said, 'These are new billy clubs, and you're
the first we're using them on.' "
Dellory Crooks filed a complaint at the
police department the day after the inci
dent, March 29, signed by 18 witnesses. At
Monday's demonstration, 31-year resident
Maybelle Culps said that the police depart
ment "swept everything under the rug."
The case is still under investigation.
"There are a lot of witnesses," City Man
ager Hudson said, "but I believe there's
been some difficulty in getting Mr. Crooks
to come forward with . . . the situation."
CEPA also wants to make the complaint
process more accessible. Salas distributed

forms during Monday's demonstration to
anyone who felt they had been treated un
justly by the police. Complaint forms are
currently available in the City Manager's
office as well as the police department, but
some residents feel intimidated by the
process.
"They are somewhat intimidating the
way that they're put together right now,"
Hudson admitted. "They have the 're
quired advisory warning,' . . . which re
minds people what the penalties are if they
are fraudulently, frivolously filing their

complaint."
CEPA's final demand is
the reinstitution of the
Human Resources Com
mission (HRC), a four-per
son panel of volunteers
created by the City Council
to hear employee griev
ances. The Council dis
solved the HRC" shortly
after a March 2 hearing re
garding Robert Cole dur
ing which the panel sug
gested Cole be reinstated.
According to a May 5
administrative report,
HRC members displayed
"inappropriate conduct"
at Cole's hearing. A letter
sent to the four commis
sioners on April 5
charged the panel with
having "reached a deci
sion without thoroughly
reviewing the material
prepared by the city at
torney," and meeting
with Cole's attorney in

private and without City Attorney Michael
Lawson present.
The Council sent each commissioner a
letter on April 15 inviting them to a closed
session meeting April 19. After none ap
peared, the HRC was officially dissolved in
Oct. 1999.
A recent organizational study and full
scale audit of the police department by

policing czar, Joe Brann, is due to be dis
