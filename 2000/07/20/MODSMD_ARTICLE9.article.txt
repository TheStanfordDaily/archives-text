## 
### HELEN KWAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Miss California is not a pageant
that aims mainly at physical beauty,"
said Rita Ng who graduated from
the farm in June with a bachelor's in
Human Biology and was recently
named Miss California lor the year
2000.
The breakdown of scores in this
year's pageant justifies Ng's claim. A
contestant's talent score accounted
for 40 percent of her total score and
the interview counted for 1-50 per
cent, which is more than the evening
gown and swimsuit categories com
bined. Since Ng says she believes
that beauty comes in many ways, the
Miss California Pageant was espe
cially suited for her.
Ng, named one of the top 10 col
lege women of the year by Glamour
magazine and one of the top 20 un
dergraduates in the nation by USA
Today, received a bachelor's in
Human Biology this year with a 3.99
CPA Her thesis work, presented at
two national conferences and ac
cepted for publication in Psychology

& Aging, was honored with a Fire
stone Medal. In addition to being a
Chapell-Lougee Scholar, Beagle II
Entrepreneurial Scholar, Payson
Treat Fellow and writing tutor, Ng
found time to write a children's
book, "IVn Pals." She also serves as a
model in Procter & Gamble's Global
Beauty C -are ad campaign.
Ng encourages other young
women at Stanford to enter similar
competitions. She said that the Miss
California pageant allowed her to
meet diverse people, to learn sell 1
confidence and to advocate her plat
form issue, the promotion of the
health and welfare of needy chil
dren. During her year as Miss Cali
fornia, Ng says she will try her best to
represent Stanford and California,
as well as her hometown, Tracy,
where she founded a Young Com
posers Piano Program.
Shortly after receiving one of the
two Dinkelspiel Awards for out
standing service to undergraduate
education at Commencement on
June 11, Ng left for Fresno, where
the Miss California talent competi
tion began on June 28. She won the

Preliminary Talent Award by per
forming Beethoven's Appassionata
for piano. In her subsequent compe
titions, she received the Outstanding
Interview award, the Leni Arnhym
Classical Performer award, the
Community Service award and was
finally crowned Miss California 2000
on July 1. Ng was the first person to
win more than one award in the
pageant and also the first Asian-
American to hold the title of Miss
California.
Ng plans to continue her medical
training at UC-San Francisco in the
hopes of fulfilling her lifelong plan of
advocating children's welfare as a
pediatrician. Since UCSF allows her
to postpone her studies for a year,
Ng is now preparing for the Miss
America 2000 Pageant with a per
sonal trainer, make-up artist, hair
stylist and other consultants.
When asked what has changed in
her life since winning the title, Ng
said that she is the same person as
she was before. She feels very fortu
nate in life, especially for the positive
support she has received from her
family, friends and community. She

is living in San Diego until the na
tional competition in (X tober.
Ng can he found in the August
issues of Cosmopolitan, People
magazine, Woman's Day and
Good Housekeeping. She misses
the Stanford community and re
grets that she cannot reach each
person personally due to her du
ties as Miss California.
