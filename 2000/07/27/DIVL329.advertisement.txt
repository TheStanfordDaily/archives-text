Core Undergraduate Courses ia 2000-01
Changes have been made in the core undergraduate
Economies courses for the academic year 2000-01. Students should
plan ahead. The goals behind these changes are to improve the
sequence of instruction and to increase the probability of
undergraduates being taught by Academic Council faculty
First Econ 50M becomes a full quarter course providing
mathematical prerequisites for Economics. Students who have not
taken Math 51 or who do not pass a diagnostic test at the beginning of
Econ 50 are required to take Econ 50M before taking Econ 50. Econ
50M will be offered each quarter.
Econ 50 will be offered in the Autumn and Winter
Quarters, Econ 51 will be offered in all three Quarters, and Econ 52
will be offered in the Winter and Spring Quarters. Econ 50 is a
prerequisite for Econ 51 and 52.
The statistics and econometrics courses, Econ 80 and Econ
102, have been revised so that they constitute a sequence with the aim
of providing uninterrupted instruction. The old Econ 80 is renumbered
Econ 102 A and the old Econ 102 becomes Econ 1028. Students are
urged to take Econ 102 A and Econ 1028 in successive quarters. Econ
102 A will be offered in the Autumn and Winter Quarters and Econ
1028 will be offered in the Winter and Spring Quarters.
Here is a summary statement of when courses will be
offered in 2000-01 and of the identity of the instructor:
