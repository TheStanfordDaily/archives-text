# Teach-in: let the Farm stay that way
## 
### GREG BRAZEAL EDITORIAL STAFF 
At a community teach-in last Thursday
night, a panel of representatives from the
Stanford Open Space Alliance (SOSA), the
Committee for Oreen Foothills (CCF) and
both Menlo Park's and Palo Alto's City
Councils responded to questions about the
environmental impacts of Stanford's pro
posed 10-year development plan.
"[Stanford is] slowly whittling away at the
Foothills," said Peter Drekmeier, one of the
event's organizers and a member of SOSA.
"We want to protect these beautiful areas."
Chief among SOSA's concerns was the
plan's redesignation of a section of the
Foothills from "Academic Reserve and Open
Space" to "Academic Campus." While the
University provides no immediate plans for
the development of the area, called the Lath
rop Development District, according to
SOSA the redesignation effectively removes
the area from the Foothills, paving the way
for future development.
"Stanford has already developed 15 per
cent of its F(X)thill land, and we think the rest
should be permanently protected," Drek
meier said. According to SOSA's Web site,
the group has already collected over 10,000
signatures from people who would like to see
the Foothills protected in their current state.
Tom Jordon, a retired land use attorney,
past president of CCF and expert on Stan
ford's development plans, noted that the
University says it lacks the power to perma
nently declare an area "Open Space." If that
is the case, he argued that "Ninety-nine
years would be a good start."

The City of Palo Alto went on record in
Fall '99 asking Stanford to guarantee at least
25 years of protection for its 2,000 acres of
open spaces. Palo Alto's 4,000 acres of open
space are already "dedicated" to prevent de
velopment, according to Drekmeier.
No representatives of the University were
present at the teach-in. "My feeling is that
Stanford is not interested in having that kind
of dialogue," Drekmeier said, citing several
instances when the Board of Trustees
seemed to have made a point of avoiding
SOSA Drekmeier added that he thinks a di
alogue should happen and could result in a
"win-win situation" for both the University
and community.
Stanford's 10-year plan calls for more
than 4 million square feet of new construc
tion, or as Drekmeier frequently notes, "the
equivalent of three new Stanford Shopping
Centers." Since the last (Jeneral Use Permit
was approved by Santa Clara County in
1989, Stanford has developed 2.1 million
square feet.
"Most other top-ranking universities
don't have a fraction of this land," CCF's
Denice Dade said. She compared Stanford
to Harvard, which has stabilized its physical
growth without sacrificing its competitive
stature, despite having 2,000 more students
than Stanford and one-third the Farm's size.
"Stanford's development could be clustered
on its core campus," she said.
The teach-in drew roughly 120 people,
many of whom voiced concern about the
proposal's effect on local traffic. Palo Alto
City Council member Nancy Lytle, who
served as a city planner for 10 years, said that
she had no doubt the plan, which includes

adding 2,200 peo
ple to Stanford's
daytime popula
tion and nearly
3,000 new parking
spaces, would
cause traffic prob
lems. "I hope we
[plan] for people,
not automobiles,"
she said, but added
that Stanford and
the community
were not as far
apart on many is
sues as it might
seem.
Jordan argued
that groups like
SOSA are only ask
ing Santa Clara
County to treat
Stanford like any
other non-profit
land owner.

"The county has never said 'no' to Stan
ford," Jordan said, pointing out that in 1989
the county proposed alternatives to Stan
ford's proposal, but "throughout the alter
native section, all the alternatives were re
jected because 'the applicant would not
agree.' That is not a good reason." He also
noted that the phrase "if they can aflbrd it"
was repeated with each request.
Jordan drew attention to the fact that the
State of California has the right to refuse or
only conditionally accept any development
proposal that would create a single signifi
cant environmental impact. The recently re

leased Draft Environmental Impact Report
of Stanford's plan found 46 significant envi
ronmental impacts, though these could be
mitigated to eight. SOSA and CGF argue
that it is the legal right of the communities
surrounding Stanford to make protection of
open spaces a condition of accepting other
aspects of Stanford's proposal.
"I really feel confident that we're going to
win this one," Drekmeier said. Palo Alto's
City (x)uncil is set to comment on the envi
ronmental impact report at its July 31 meet
ing, and the Santa Clara County Planning
Commission will hold a public hearing on
the EIR in Palo Alto on Aug. 3.
