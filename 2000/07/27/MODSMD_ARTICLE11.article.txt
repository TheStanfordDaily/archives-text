# Condi taking the stage at GOP Convention

Senior Fellow Gondoleezza Rice is
slated to headline the second night of
the Republican National Convention,
sharing the stage this coining Tues
day with Elizabeth Hole and Sen.
John McCain. The day's theme is
"Strength and Security with A Pur
pose: Safe in our Homes and in the
World," with a focus on the restora
tion of military morale and readiness.
Rice has already taken public
stands in favor of a strengthened mil
itary that emphasizes promotion of
the "national interest." In an article in
the January/February issue of "For
eign Affairs," Rice argued that foreign
policy in a Republican administration
should embrace the nation's role as
the world's leader, expand the mili
tary but use it more critically in hu
manitarian intervention and utilize
free trade and economic liberalization
as tools of political liberalization.
The convention, beginning Mon
day in Philadelphia with addresses
from Laura Bush and General Colin
Powell, will culminate Thursday
night as Gov. Bush officially accepts
the Republican nomination for presi

dent. Along with Rice's speech, Tues
day's events will include a tribute to
past Republican presidents and to
America's "Greatest Generation."
Rice took a leave of absence from
Stanford in July 1999 and since then
has played an increasingly prominent
role in the presidential campaign of
Gov. George W. Bush, supervising his
foreign policy team, helping polish
his speeches and advising him on pol
icy specifics. If Bush wins in Novem
ber, many speculate that he could se
lect Rice as National Security Advisor
or perhaps even Secretary of State.
Tuesday's speech will not be Rice's
first appearance at a Republican na
tional convention. In 1992, she took
the stage to defend the foreign policy
of President George Bush after three
years as his Soviet analyst, a time in
which she helped bring democratic re
forms to Poland and helped guide
Bush's policies regarding the former
Soviet Union. She later co-authored a
book on the period, "Germany Unified
and Europe Transformed: A Study in
Statecraft," with Philip Zelikow.
"You often can't tell from people's
titles how important they are, what
the real story is," Zelikow told Stan
ford's short-lived "Jr." magazine in
1995. "When she joined the adniinis

nation, she was the only full-time So
viet expert in the White House. Peo
ple have this preconception of the Na
tional Security Council, that the pres
ident has 30 to 40 people who advise
him on Soviet affairs. It's not true.
There's one, and she was it."
Rice has led a distinguished career
at Stanford since arriving in 1981 with
a doctorate from the University of
Denver, where she enrolled as an un
dergraduate at the age of 15. A cele
brated teacher from the start, Rice be
came a national fellow for the Hoover
Institution in 1985. As provost from
1993 to '99, she initiated a character
istically pragmatic, unflinching pro
gram of financial "restructuring" with
University President Gerhard
Casper, a controversial attempt to re
deem the University's damaged repu
tation for fiscal responsibility.
Rice has received heavy media cov
erage since joining the Bush cam
paign, in part because, as pundit
David Plotz puts it, "She stands out in
Bush's army of white men." But even
with the announcement of fellow
Texas oil man Richard Cheney as
Bush's running mate, Rice's demo
graphic qualities have little chance, in
the end, of stealing the spotlight from
her celebrated skills and experience.
