## DAILY VIEWPOINT Shedding old habits along with a layer of sunburnt skin 
### MEREDITH ROWE STAFF COLUMNIST 
I am a sun idiot.
Ever}' summer of my childhood was spent
being the unwilling sunburned poster child
lor "Reasons Why Too Much Sun Exposure is
Bad."
I've learned a lot of useful skills in my life,
from french braiding hair to the translation of
a few choice phrases in Mandarin, but there's
one thing I've yet to master.
For some reason, my brain does not under
stand the command to "wear sunscreen." In
one ear and out the other.
I was one of those little kids who came
home from a clay spent at the water park only
slightly less pink than cotton candy. When my
mother would try to cajole me into standing
still for a few seconds so she could slather some
sunscreen on me in the morning, I'd run off,
declaring triumphantly that I alone was safe
from sunburn. After all, I would reason, how
can the sun get you when you're underwater?
I was 8 years old and invincible.
Of course, these words were all but forgot
ten when I lay in bed for the next few days, so
achy and burned that the warmth radiating
from my body would have been enough to
heat several New England homes for weeks
during the winter.

C'lying and moaning and trying not to
move, I'd wonder why my mom had been so
cruel as to let me suffer so.
I was the star of this scene approximately
4,636 times while 1 was growing up.
Naturally, one would think that as 1 got
older I'd learn my lesson and start layering on
the sunscreen.
Maybe not.
My dorm took a trip to Los Angeles early
this April, and I gladly tagged along. A day at
the beach, museums, maybe even Disneyland
â€” what more could a college sophomore ask
for?
On the morning of our beach outing, all of
my friends covered themselves in sunscreen. I
watched them from my towel on the sand,
laughing. "Come on, it's only April," I told
them wisely. "And it's only L.A. It's not like it's
Mexico or something!"
After all, I'm from Texas, I smiled to myself.
If anyone knows the sun, surely it's me. Sun
burn in L.A. in early spring? Whatever!
The sun knew me pretty well, too, six hours
later. My RA tilted her sunglasses, peered at
in) face, let her jaw drop about 16 inches and
hollered, "Oh my God!"
I spent the next three weeks hiding under
a thick blue veil of Aloe Vera, peeling dead
skin from my knees and nose.
Fast forward about four months. My par

ents have a penchant for taking summer vaca
tion trips to tropical places like Hawaii, Mexi
co and the Bahamas, and it has become a tra
dition to set aside a few days each July and
head for the hottest place we can find (it's not
hot enough in Texas, you see).
Because of these trips, I've acquired this
nasty little bottle of liquid called "Native Tan."
As a little girl, I didn't want to waste my time
with sunscreen because I was too busy run
ning for the water slide. But for the past few
years, I must admit, I've been dying to be tan
like "everyone else."
Back to Native Tan. It's a tanning oil and
comes with a scary,
ominous-sounding announcement printed in
block letters on the label: "Warning: this oil
contains very rich, exotic ingredients and is
only for those who have already acquired a
dark tan."
Since I have fair skin, a dusting of freckles,
reddish blonde hair and green eyes, this obvi
ously means me.
I've used this stuff on every one of our
beach vacations over the past few years.
summer, it resulted in a rather unat
tractive-looking blistery type area above my
neckline. Not good times. This prompted
shocked looks from all of my friends and sum
mer coworkers and convinced even me, the
sun idiot, to get ahold of the sunscreen for all

future sun outings.
So, this past weekend in Playa del Carmen,
Mexico, I was good. Admirable, even. I hit the
beach and only stayed outside for a few hours
(off of peak sun exposure time). Native Tan?
Used only sparingly on often sun-exposed
areas.
Seventy-two hours later, I sit here typing
this column very carefully, because once again
I'm so burned that it hurts when people even
do so much as to glance my way. My face is
scarlet pink, and because I had the good sense
to wear sunglasses, 1 have a really spiffy look
ing "sunglass line."
I can't win.
But at least I've learned something. Native
Tan? It's in the trash, destined for some kind
of resting place for all othei evil sun products,
like spray-in hair highlighters (for the "bleach"
look in 30 minutes) and self-tanning lotions
that turn your skin an unsightly orange shade.
Wide-brimmed straw hats, here I come.
And sunscreen? It's really worth the trou
ble. Trust me on this one.
