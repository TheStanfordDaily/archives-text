Riders show support to keep
Menlo Park Marguerite route open
The Menlo Marguerite is a shut
tle that runs from Hoover Tower to
the Stanford Medical Center,
Welch Road, the Stanford Shop
ping Center and along El Camino
Real north to the Menlo Park Cal
train station. From there, the bus
travels down Santa ( a uz to the Sand
Hill Road businesses.
The City of Menlo Park has been
writing grants to support the Menlo
Marguerite line in lull while Stan
ford has provided buses for use at a
reduced rate. The line has been
funded by the Bay Area Air Quality
Management District, which gets its
funds from sales taxes.
This year li Hiding was severely re
duced. Hence, it was decided that
the sei"vice between Stanford and the
Menlo Park Caltrain would be sacri
ficed in order to maintain service
going from the Menlo Park Caltrain
to the Sand Hill Road businesses.
Although it seems inevitable that
the Sand Hill Road leg of the route
needs to be separated from the
Stanford leg of the route to sat isfy a
funding requirement, these two
l(K>ps can be easily coordinated so
that the current service route could

be kept intact.
There is considerable interest
among current riders to continue
shuttle service between Stanford
and Menlo Park. We strongly feel
that this service is beneficial to Uni
versity employees and students.
Ridership on this route has grown
steadily from 74 to over 120 riders
per day since its inception in 1997.
Ridership would grow still more if
this service were advertised to Stan
ford students without cars, to resi
dents of Menlo Park, as well as to
Caltrain commuters who would
enjoy reduced fares by descending
at the Menlo Park Caltrain stop.
In our view, service to a third (Cal
train station (in addition to the two
in Palo Alto), if properly advertised,
would help "load-balance" the large
number of Stanford commuters
who presently crowd the Mar
guerite "A" line — to everyone's
benefit. Furthermore, Caltrain com
muters coining from the north
would benefit from lower fares.
We are urging Parking and
Transportation Services at Stan
lord to not only continue this ser
vice, but to time the shuttles to
meet the trains, as is done at the
Palo Alto stations.
Riders of the Menlo Marguerite

will attest that it is quick, efficient,
provides a safe ride and is a great al
ternative to fighting through rush
hour traffic.
The Menlo Park City Council as
a whole is supportive of this route.
In the City Council meeting on July
18, four of five city council members
supported approving the approxi
mately $25,000 needed to keep
both the Stanford and Sand Hill
Road legs of the shuttle going for
another five months in order to buy
time to work on more long-term
funding with Stanford.
The riders of the Menlo Mar
guerite are asking Stanford to fi
nancially support this route, both
for the short term and in the long
term if necessary, as a service that is
very valuable to a significant and ris
ing number of students and em
ployees. The City of Menlo Park
seems willing to cooperate and to
provide part of the necessary fund
ing at least for now.
We're committed to undertak
ing whatever action we can to en
courage a dialogue about this
route between Menlo Park and
Stanford. We would be honored if
the Stanford or Menlo Park Trans
portation offices asked us for assis
tance of any kind.
