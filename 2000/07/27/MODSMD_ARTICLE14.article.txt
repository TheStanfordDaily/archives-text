## Williams, Seles advance at Bank of the West 
### DENNIS TYLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Powerful ground strokes were definitely on display
at the Taube Family Tennis Stadium last night as
Venus Williams and Monica Seles both rolled to
straight set victories in their first matches of the Bank
of the West tournament.
The road the two stars took to the quarterfinals,
however, could not have been more different.
Williams cruised to a straight set win over Ta
tiana Panova in less than hour, while Seles rallied to
beat Meghann Shaughnessy in almost two hours.
Williams, ranked third in the world, blistered her
opponent off the court in only 52 minutes, with
Panova scrambling the entire match just to keep up
with Venus' powerful ground strokes in the (>-2, 6-2
victory.
With 10 aces from her monster serve, Venus won
100 percent of her first serve points and 62 percent of
her second serve points. More importantly, she re
mained focused throughout the match, winning four
of seven break point chances.
"I was just having fun," Williams said, "tryingout a
lot of things and hitting as hard .is 1 could."
Although Williams hit a lot of winners, at certain
times errors did creep into her game. She sent nu
merous balls Hailing beyond the baseline and put up
a weak 40 percent first serve percentage. No matter
what Panova tried, however, she simply could not
keep up with Williams' aggressive play.
"I'm thinking more aggressively, willing to take
more opportunities and not sit back," said Williams.
Seles, iii contrast, had a much m< >ie competitive match.
In the first set, both players were holding serve
fairly consistently until Seles drew first blood at 5-4.
Seles got her first set point, but Shaughnessy
fought it off with an inside out forehand on the line
and then followed up with another inside out fore
hand to gain an advantage. The game went back and
forth from deuce to ad eight times.
On Seles' second set point, Shaughnessy served up
a 101 mph ace, and after eight deuces finally won the
game with a forehand down the line.
Later in the first set at 6-5, Seles went up 40-love on

Shaughnessy's serve but proceeded to lose four con
secutive points. Seles managed to hang tough and fi
nally won the first set off of a forehand error by
Shaughnessy that landed into the net.
In spite of the odds against her, considering she
was taking on the number five player in the world,
Shaughnessy refused to go away.
In the second set, Seles started off strong winning
the first six points, but then Shaughnessy fought back
and held serve. Seles had numerous opportunities to
break but did not capitalize on them, and she seemed
frustrated during the match at how few times she
broke Shaughnessy.
"I broke her so few times even though I had so
many chances," said Seles following the match.
At 2-1 in the second set, she went up 40-0 on
Shaughnessy's serve but lost the next three games and
proceeded to go back and forth with deuces.
Throughout the match, Seles won her service
game somewhat easily, winning three in a row at 40-
0. Seles had chances to break Shaughnessy, with 18
break points, but only converted twice for the match.
This, in addition to the fact that she won only 5(5 per
cent of the points off of Shaughnessy's second serve,
made her performance look meager considering
she's one of the best returners in the game today.
"I was very surprised at how little I did with her
second serve," said Seles.
Bt it at 4-.S iii the sect >nd set. Seles had litlally had enough.
She went up 40-0 again on Shaughnessy's serve and
refused to lose (he next point. She won the point off a
forehand error fi om Shaughnessy and finished oil the
second set by winning the last eight points of the match,
ending with a crisp forehand down the line.
After her 7-5,6-3 victory, Seles took issue with the Bank
of the West's unusual setup, which places two courts side
by-side with matches often taking place simultaneously.
"There were many distractions with line calls and
balls coming on the other side of the court. .. but I
think today I was probably my biggest distraction,"
Seles said.

suffered on her left hand. Coming off her win at an

of seven break point chances.
"I was just having fun," Williams said, "tryingout a
lot of things and hitting as hard .is 1 could."
Although Williams hit a lot of winners, at certain
times errors did creep into her game. She sent nu
merous balls Hailing beyond the baseline and put up
a weak 40 percent first serve percentage. No matter
what Panova tried, however, she simply could not
keep up with Williams' aggressive play.
"I'm thinking more aggressively, willing to take
more opportunities and not sit back," said Williams.
Seles, iii contrast, had a much m< >ie competitive match.
In the first set, both players were holding serve
fairly consistently until Seles drew first blood at 5-4.
Seles got her first set point, but Shaughnessy
fought it off with an inside out forehand on the line
and then followed up with another inside out fore
hand to gain an advantage. The game went back and
forth from deuce to ad eight times.
On Seles' second set point, Shaughnessy served up
a 101 mph ace, and after eight deuces finally won the
game with a forehand down the line.
Later in the first set at 6-5, Seles went up 40-love on

Shaughnessy's serve but proceeded to lose four con
secutive points. Seles managed to hang tough and fi
nally won the first set off of a forehand error by
Shaughnessy that landed into the net.
In spite of the odds against her, considering she
was taking on the number five player in the world,
Shaughnessy refused to go away.
In the second set, Seles started off strong winning
the first six points, but then Shaughnessy fought back
and held serve. Seles had numerous opportunities to
break but did not capitalize on them, and she seemed
frustrated during the match at how few times she
broke Shaughnessy.
"I broke her so few times even though I had so
many chances," said Seles following the match.
At 2-1 in the second set, she went up 40-0 on
Shaughnessy's serve but lost the next three games and
proceeded to go back and forth with deuces.
Throughout the match, Seles won her service
game somewhat easily, winning three in a row at 40-
0. Seles had chances to break Shaughnessy, with 18
break points, but only converted twice for the match.
This, in addition to the fact that she won only 5(5 per
cent of the points off of Shaughnessy's second serve,
made her performance look meager considering
she's one of the best returners in the game today.
"I was very surprised at how little I did with her
second serve," said Seles.
Bt it at 4-.S iii the sect >nd set. Seles had litlally had enough.
She went up 40-0 again on Shaughnessy's serve and
refused to lose (he next point. She won the point off a
forehand error fi om Shaughnessy and finished oil the
second set by winning the last eight points of the match,
ending with a crisp forehand down the line.
After her 7-5,6-3 victory, Seles took issue with the Bank
of the West's unusual setup, which places two courts side
by-side with matches often taking place simultaneously.
"There were many distractions with line calls and
balls coming on the other side of the court. .. but I
think today I was probably my biggest distraction,"
Seles said.
Seles managed to win in spite of a recent injury she
suffered on her left hand. Coming off her win at an
