# Venus continues to serve up awesome numbers
## 
### 
There's a little sign in the corner of
the tennis courts at Taube Family
Tennis Stadium set up specifically
for the Bank of the West Classic.
It serves the innocuous purpose of dis
playing a player's serve speed, something
that typically causes heads to shake in
amazement, but Wednesday night the sign
served a different purpose.
To understand Venus Williams' utter
domination in her second round victory
over hapless Tatiana I'anova, only a couple
glances at the speed sign were necessary:
One look, right after Venus served: 115
miles per hour.
One look, right after I'anova served: 75
miles per hour.
Throughout the 52 minutes she stood in
bravely against Venus, I'anova endured that

blistering serve tune and
time again, sometimes
watching helplessly as it
blistered by, sometimes
getting good wood (or
should 1 say catgut?) on it
and dropping it back in
lor Venus to blast, again.
I'anova put up a
valiant effort, hitting

some nice winners of her own and forcing
Venus into a few mistakes. For a brief sec
ond, it looked like she could compete. And
then the numbers hit you. One hundred
seventeen vs. 75.
The Russian had the look of a deer
caught in headlights, which is something
most of Venus' opponents these days expe
rience as a matter of course. Not everyone

hits as slow as Panova did, but no one, short
of maybe Lindsay Davenport or little sis Ser
ena, can match Venus' smoke.
Her game is power, pure and simple. Oh,
she can lay a nice lob shot in now and then,
or occasionally place one down the line, but
the accuracy is not where Venus dominates,
as evidenced by her weak 49 percent first
serve percentage.
It's the numbers that make you notice
her, and her play that puts you in awe. Ten
nis hasn't seen anything like Venus (and, to
be fair, Serena) before in its long history, for
more reasons than one.
fhe obvious one, of course, is her skin
color. Black female tennis stars have been in
short supply, from the clays of Althea Gibson
to Zina Garrison and Lori McNeil. Even
these days, in a world that's as color blind as

ii ever has been, Venus and her sister are the
lone African-Americans in the elite of
women's tennis, which is dominated by
whites.
The more intriguing reason, however, is
her sheei athleticism. She stands at an im
pressive 6 feet 1 inch, towering over oppo
nents like the Lilliputian Panova, at 5 feet 2
inches. Muscles abound Venus' body, mus
cles that give her an amazing reach on the
court and the ability to send balls back at
phenomenal speeds. From the moment the
racket swings back, the ball darts over the
net and past the opponent in such a way that
people's jaws drop as they turn to each other
in amazement.
It's a style of tennis that isn't typical for


Tim Kane
most women, but it brings a level
of excitement to the game and to
the fans that gives hope for the fu
ture of tennis, a future that is

cloudy at best.
The sign will be at Taube for the
next tew days, watching from the
side as Venus goes after yet anoth
er title. If the tickets aren't sold out
by the time this article comes out,
spend the cash and head out to
watch. It won't be long before your
mouth drops open, too.
