# On to Sydney: Hauser sews up spot on Olympic track team
## 
### BEN ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When Brad Hauser raced for the final time in a
Stanford jersey at the NCAA Championships in June,
winning both the 5,000- and 10,000-meter runs, it was
clear that the senior was on to bigger and better things.
Alter those triumphs, 1 lauser's second-place show
ing last Friday in the 5,000 meters at the ()lympic Tri
als in Sacramento hardly seems surprising. Finishing
just behind Adam Goucher of Fila, 1 lauser's personal
best time of 13 minutes, 27.31 seconds met the
()lympic 'A' standard of 13:29.00 and gave him a spot
on the U.S. team heading to Sydney in September.
Mauser's triumph becomes even more impressive
when you consider the lew "minor" obstacles he faced
en route to his Olympic bid.
There was the 10,000-meter final July 14 (Hauser
placed fifth), which cooked the legs of most other
contenders who tried to double back in the 5,000
meters. Then Hauser took on the field in the 5,000
semifinal last Monday, winning in a mad dash to the
tape, a move that may have drained his muscles even
further.
And then there was the trip to the hospital Friday
morning, when Hauser was experiencing back
spasms that made it difficult to stand up straight. His
father drove him in for X-rays, and though the pain
had not subsided by the time warm-ups began,
Hauser didn't appear to be willing to wait another
four years for a shot at the world's biggest track meet.
When the gun went off, it was Nike's Bob Kennedy
who took control of the race. Through the first mile,
his pace was strong enough to dip under 13:00 —
Kennedy is the only American to ever have bettered
that mark. Kennedy faded however, and though
other leaders came and went through the three-plus

mile race, Goucher and Hauser stayed widiin striking
distance.
"All I was thinking about was be patient and stay
with Adam as long as possible, because I knew he'd
get where he wanted to go," Hauser said.
When Nike's Nick Rogers broke for the lead with
less than a mile to go, the pack stratified and the top
three were evident. Rogers hung on for third
(13:29.48) and Goucher (13:27.06) just clipped
Hauser at the line.
Other Stanford finishers included sophomore
Jonathon Riley (eighth, 13:46.24) and senior Brent
Hauser (13:57.71)
Brad Hauser now joins former Cardinal team
mates Gabe Jennings, the sophomore 1,500-meter
champ (3:35.90), and junior Michael Stember (third
in the 1,500, 3:37.04) on the USA track team bound
for the Olympics.
"We started out the season with a dream of win
ning the NGAA championships," Hauser said. "It
happened. I thought coming in my best chance was
in the 10,000. I stayed confident and it worked out."
By virtue of their 'A' standard times, Hauser and
Jennings now have the option of laying low for the
remainder of the summer, racing only to stay in
shape. Stember, however, still must hit the 'A' stan
dard of 3:36.80 before Sept. 11. A meet at Stanford
on July 29 should provide Stember with an oppor
tunity.
Also of note Friday at the Trials was Stanford
alumna Regina Jacobs, a 36-year old distance phe
nom, who set a new American record in the
women's 5,000 meters at 14:45.52, smashing her
previous record by more than seven seconds. Jacobs
still holds the Stanford record for the 1,500 meters
(4:12.3) and was the U.S. champion at that distance
last week.
