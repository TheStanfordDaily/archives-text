## 
### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
In a surprise announcement, Athletic Depart
ment officials have shelved a plan that would have
placed "virtual" advertisements into television
broadcasts of men's basketball games alter top Uni
versity officials objected to the proposal
The Department of Athletics announced the deal
with Princeton Video Image Inc. last week, just over
a month alter University President Gerhard Casper
ordered all advertisements removed from Stanford
Stadium and Maples Pavilion.
University officials, including Casper and Provost
John Hennessey, apparently were not aware of the
plan until after the Athletics Department had made
the announcement, and they c hose to reject the idea.
Along with Hennessey, Casper considered the virtu
al ads to be contrary to his wish for zero commercial
ization in Stanford's sports venues.
"The increasing role of commercialization in ath
letics is worrisome to [Casper], said University Direc
tor of Communications Alan Acosta.
According to the terms of the original agreement,
Princeton Video was to place computer-generated
graphics into the home viewer's picture alongside the
free throw lines on the basketball court, only appear

ing on television and not within Maples Pavilion itself.
Such advertising is relatively common in major
league baseball broadcasts; in fact, New Jersey-based
Princeton Video is a leading supplier of such tech
nology to networks televising baseball games.
With the recent success of the men's basketball
team, television ratings of games have been rising
steadily, and the University would likely have been
able to increase the amount of revenue gained
through such broadcasts.
In the wake of Casper's recent decision to remove
all advertisements from the venues, the potential
revenue from the virtual broadcasts became even
more important as the Athletics Department seeks
ways to make up for the millions in lost income.
"Our corporate sponsors are very important to us
and the financial health of our department," Assis
tant Athletic Director Gary Migdol told the San Fran
cisco Chronicle. "In most cases billboard signage is a
critical part of the corporate sponsorship, but we do
feel confident that we will not sulfer from a budget
standpoint."
Migdol also told the Chronicle that the Athletics
Department would have to become more creative
in its marketing, with the aim of increasing ticket
sales and convincing sponsors to align with the
University.
