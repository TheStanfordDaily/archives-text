## Solid ‘Les Mis' touring company rolls into SF’s Curran 
### MONYA DE EDITORIAL STAFF 
fhe Curran Theater's current
production of "Les Miserables" is
a triumph. Years of production in
every major U.S. city and songs fa
miliar to even the casual theater
patron have not eroded the ap
peal of this musical. Drawing 011
the emotional and historical ap
peal of Victor Hugo's story, the
players create a remarkable expe
rience 011 stage.
The story goes like this: Jean
Valjean, imprisoned for 20 years,
breaks parole and disappears.
Javert, a police inspector with a
really, really bad childhood, vows
to find him. However, his chances
are not implied to be good when
he meets the mayor of a town
years later and doesn't realize that
it's Valjean with a shave and hair
cut.
Valjean is also a factory owner,
and when he finds that one of his
workers is a dying prostitute and
has an illegitimate child, lie

promises to care for her. The
child, Cosette, is taken from the
cruel innkeepers who keep her
and grows up thinking Valjean is
her father. Against the backdrop
of the revolution of the poor in
France, Cosette matures and falls
in love, Valjean fights for the re
sistance and J avert pursues Val
jean.
The standouts in the cast are
Ivan Rutherford as Valjean and
Stephen Tewksbury as Enjolras,
the leader of the students who fire
up revolution. Rutherford sings
and acts superbly, most notably in
his interactions with (avert and his
sublime performance of "Bring
Him Home."
In this song, he prays for the
safety of Marius, the student who
loves Cosette and is loved by Epo
nine, the Thenardier daughter. As
the lullaby drew to a close, his
voice melted into the high notes of
the violin until they sounded like
one instrument. The audience re
sponded with the most enthusias
tic cheers and whistles of the

evening.
Tewksbury, on the other hand,
galvanizes the stage with energy,
patriotism and a huge, strong bari
tone that soars above the orches
tra's loudest crescendos. Stephen
Bishop clearly relishes his role as
(avert and succeeds at fleshing out
this complicated character.
In the love triangle, Tim
Howar's Marius is a pivot point.
Unfortunately, the script doesn't
let Marius do much other than
pine for Cosette, get shot and res
cued and ignore Eponine. But his
performance of "Empty Chairs at
Empty Tables" is lovely. Diana
Kaarina's Eponine sings her songs
in the appropriate "Broadway"
voice and is quite convincing as the
doomed victim of unrequited love.
Emma Hunton, as Young
Cosette, even looks like the girl on
the übiquitous "Les Mis" t-shirts
and sings a perfect rendition of
"Castle on a Cloud." Regan Thiel,
as Cosette, sings her music {law
lessly. But Thiel doesn't make
Cosette a sympathetic character.

Her love for Marius just isn't pal
pable the way Eponine's feelings
are.
Monsieur and Madame
Thenardier, the innkeepers, pro
vide comic relief. Aymee Garcia, as
Madame, must be seen to be be
lieved. She is a huge caricature of
her character, with a large pouf of
bright red hair. Needless to say,
she got plenty of laughs as she
faked love for Cosette and trash
talked (or trash-sang) about her
inept husband.
J. P. Dougherty, as Monsieur,
was a little stiff during the first inn
song, "Master of the House," al
though the song is a perfect op
portunity for Thenardier to exude
wacky and raunchy charisma.
Later, he missed a cue during the
exchange of Cosette for Valjean's
money. But he let it all go during
"Beggars at the Feast," a song
sung during the "Les Miserables"
wedding.
The sight of the couple made
up with garish cosmetics, wearing
miles of ruflles 011 their clothes

and tripping over themselves try
ing to steal the silver is almost too
much to handle. Dougherty was
especially hilarious as he tried to
blame others for the thefts.
The placement of this musical
in the Curran spotlights the need
for larger stages in San Francisco
and environs. The barricades are
impeccably constructed, but the
people aren't as convincing as they
could be as a small army because
they have only so much room.
"Les Mis" is grandest on a mile
long stage like New York's Imper
ial or London's Royal National.
But, for a musical as complex as
this one, the actors achieve an en
gaging performance within the
confines of the Curran.
