# Soulful Mtukudzi shines in traditional album Paivepo
## 
### WILL TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
(Miver Mtukudzi is not a house
hold name in the United States.
Nor will he ever likely he. Face it,
the market for world music in this
country is very specialized. It isn't
going to go away, thankfully, but
there also are far too many Brit
ney Spears in the world for the
genre to ever crack the Billboard
charts. On occasion there may he
the odd breakout, like Buju Ban
ton or Beenie-Man from the reg
gae ranks, hut on the whole there
aren't enough people iti America
willing to take the chance on the
music of other countries.
It's a shame, because there are
some really good beats out there
that could teach Americans a
thing or two. Mtukudzi's album,
Paivepo is one such album. His
rhythms are fluid, the instrumen
tation is done well, and his voice is
rich and stirring. He has been
called the Otis Redding of Zim
babwe, and the comparisions
aren't all that far- fetched. The
album has more of an old-time
soul feel to it than anything that
Sisqo or his ilk could ever really
produce these days.

"Pindurai Mambo" opens the
album with a rather simple beat,
but Mtukudzi's voice carries
across the song well. The use of
three guitars, acoustic, bass and a
lead electric allows for arrange
ments that draw from the
strengths of all three without over
emphasis on any one.
The second track continues to
expand the instrumentation to in
clude keyboards and additional
percussion instruments.
One of the best things about
the songs on this album are the
backup singers, whose harmonies
are traditional in that they realize
that the purpose of a backing
vocal is to support and enhance
the lead vocals. Here they are sim
ple, choral and unobtrusive. This
comes across as somewhat re
freshing in a day when everyone is
trying to outshine one another as
much as possible. There is a com
munal feel to the vocal approach
on some tracks, as though some
songs are done by committee,
with Mtukudzi as the glue holding
them together.
On reading the liner notes, one
can see how the actual songs
themselves can become tedious.
Many of the lyrics revolve around

traditional beliefs, and that can
easily become something that
younger generations would rebel
against. But Mtukudzi has talent
to spare. The best track on the
album, "Ndine Mubvunzo," is an
incredibly soulful tune. The key
hoards turn into an incredibly
soulful organ, and it all is held to
gether by Mtukudzi. 1 lis voice has
a certain sadness to it that is defi
nitely reminiscent of Otis Red
ding or Marvin Gaye.
World music is a good thing. It
brings a new touch to doldrums of
the usual musical fare and is usu
ally responsible for the ideas that
are eventually copied by others in
the business. If you are tired as 1
am of the same old drivel that's
been circulating recently, then try
something a little outside the box.
As always, I advocate the use of
Napster to try out tracks before
buying an album. So go that
route, then raid the bins.
