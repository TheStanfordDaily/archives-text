# 'Loser' is just that

### MICHAEL BAER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Loser," directed by Amy 1 leckerling (whose previous films include
high-school romps "Clueless" and "Fast Times at Ridgemont High"),
takes a look at a small town hoy in a big (New York) city college. Not
an original idea, but "Loser" fits it to the mold of the '90s teen come
dy. This is not surprising considering its lead actors, Jason Biggs and
Mena Suvari, also costarred in the tremendously successful "American
Pie" (though the latter is better known for her role in "American Beau
ty")-
As in "Beauty," Suvari plays a cynical late teen with questionable
grounding who finds herself in inessed-up situation. This, in spite of
the fact that she is one of the only characters in this movie who cares
for others. In "Loser," her Dora is the first person to pay any attention
— albeit platonic — to the good-natured Paul, who hails from the
aforementioned small town.
Paul is your prototypical "nice guy," someone who would only par
ticipate in theft as a non-narcing accessory and only lie to make a girl
feel loved by her inept significant other. Seeing Paul put up with
everything he does (including three jerk freshman roommates who
make my jerk freshman roommates look like angels) is a hit over the
top, but it's amusing and it does drive home who Paul is.
Dora's caring qualities show in the little things she does. Masked by
hemi-Goth garb and a bitter facade, it's she who cares about Paul when
he falls down stairs, which both his class and professor (Oscar-winning
Greg Kinnear) merely make fun of.
Of course, in spite of her cynicism, Dora's good nature finds her
often being a tad gullible — for example, she's smitten with Professor
Alcott (Kinnear), who, other than complimenting her after sex and
saying he loves her, is pretty much a jerk. Such minor illustrations of
fondness keep Dora in the clandestine relationship, in spite of his sar
casm and condescension, which she fights with words, not with leav
ing.
Even when she finds that being on a sidewalk with Paul is much
more fun than being in bed with Al
cott, that four-letter word (love)
makes her think that to dump Alcott
would be to ruin her only chance at
happiness.
So it's clear what's going to happen
in the film (and anyone who has seen
"Clueless" will note it happened simi
larly there), but the journey is why
we're here.
On the upside, the film is amusing
with clever twists and turns. Such
turns are aided by multiple celebrity
cameos without distracting too much
from the main plot.
On the other hand, "Loser" nears
neither the insight of the '80s comedy
"Say Anything" or the laughs of
"American Pie." Perhaps that's a bit
much to hope for, but 1 didn't feel ter
ribly involved with the characters of
"Loser" either.
Sure, I sympathized and even iden
tified with the various characters and
situations, but, as with many a teen
comedy, it seemed rather lightweight.
Not exactly a disappointment, but it
would have been nice to feel as en
grossed in this film as 1 would have
been in an "adult" film.
Although the script may be light
weight, the lead and supporting cast is
first-rate. Kinnear drops the Mr. Nice
Guy we're used to from films like "As
Good As ft Gets" to play the uncaring
(and rather dumb) professor.
Paul's roommates are humorously
devious in their plans to make college

a non-stop party (and cruelly manipu
late anyone who gets in their way).
They play the parts well, even though,
for two of them, this is their debut.
Zak Orth is a veteran of such films
as "In and Out" and "William Shake
speare's Romeo + Juliet." Thomas Sa
doski plays the group's effeminate
spokesman, and Jimmi Simpson is a
dead ringer for a younger Christian
Slater.
Heckerling claims she wanted to
write and direct a film similar to her
own college experience, where keep
ing financially afloat (and enrolled)
was a constant struggle. "Loser" cap
tures this, albeit it not as realistically as
it could; it seems our two heroes are
the only ones with a limited budget,
and near the end of the film money
ceases to be an object. But such exag
gerations we'd expect from the writer
of "Clueless."
What Heckerling has really made is
an average teen comedy, one that
movie viewers might be advised to see
over other choices in the genre but
one they shouldn't kick themselves for
missing.
