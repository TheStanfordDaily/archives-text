# 'Loser' is just that

"Loser," directed by Amy 1 leckerling (whose previous films include
high-school romps "Clueless" and "Fast Times at Ridgemont High"),
takes a look at a small town hoy in a big (New York) city college. Not
an original idea, but "Loser" fits it to the mold of the '90s teen come
dy. This is not surprising considering its lead actors, Jason Biggs and
Mena Suvari, also costarred in the tremendously successful "American
Pie" (though the latter is better known for her role in "American Beau

As in "Beauty," Suvari plays a cynical late teen with questionable
grounding who finds herself in inessed-up situation. This, in spite of
the fact that she is one of the only characters in this movie who cares

aforementioned small town.
Paul is your prototypical "nice guy," someone who would only par

Dora's caring qualities show in the little things she does. Masked by
hemi-Goth garb and a bitter facade, it's she who cares about Paul when
he falls down stairs, which both his class and professor (Oscar-winning
Greg Kinnear) merely make fun of.
Of course, in spite of her cynicism, Dora's good nature finds her
often being a tad gullible — for example, she's smitten with Professor
Alcott (Kinnear), who, other than complimenting her after sex and
saying he loves her, is pretty much a jerk. Such minor illustrations of
fondness keep Dora in the clandestine relationship, in spite of his sar
casm and condescension, which she fights with words, not with leav
ing.
Even when she finds that being on a sidewalk with Paul is much
