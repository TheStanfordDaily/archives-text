# Give Veruca's Nina Gordon a listen 'Tonight'
## 
### MICHAEL BAER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Seether," Veruca Salt's hit which catapulted the band to
fame, also earned the band the derision of critics, who noted that
the song had much to owe to other grunge-era bands such as the
Breeders and Belly. The public seemed to agree with this second
class status when Veruca Salt was quickly forgotten and sank back
into the obscurity from whence they came.
Now, Nina Gordon, former singer/songwriter of such Salt
tunes as "Seether," is out to prove them all wrong. Her first solo
release, Tonight and the Rest of My Life (Warner Bros. Records),
is quite different from the power pop Veruca Salt was best known
for. It has a far more commercial and popular sound to it, likely
due to producer Bob R<xk, a man known for commercializing
(and reviving) such diverse and hard-to-tame acts as Metallica,
Cher, and Aerosmith.
In fact, on first listen, "Tonight" seems a lot closer to teen stars
Christina Aguilera or Tiffany than to Veruca Salt. Lush produc
tion fills the mostly ballad-oriented music on this disc, which in
dulges in simple rhyme schemes and the overexamined topic of
romantic relationships. And at times there's the odd cliched lyric
such as "When we're apart I still feel together /1 still believe in a
place called forever."
However, on subsequent plays the depth and beauty of this
music — flaws and all — is revealed, as is the consistent musical
and lyrical quality of the disc. Whereas most albums of this genre
often rehash lesser versions of their hit singles, Tonight's 13
tracks are all worth listening to over and over. While the press re
lease recommends the tenderly heartbreaking songs "Hold On
To Me" and "New Year's Eve," 112 noted other standouts such as
the optimistic: "2003' and the wistfully reflective "Horses in the
C '.ity." The latter song pulls off a metaphor — one for feeling out
of place in life and in love — that most of today's pop sensations
could not hope to sincerely cat ry oil.
Even more impressive, all but one track — a heartbreaking
rendering of the old Skeeter Davis weepy, "The End ol the

World" — are penned by Nina Gordon herself. This last track
ends the album, which reveals itself to be a descent from the ec
stasy of falling in love to the hopelessness of knowing that ecstasy
will never return. Few albums I've heard have dared to take this
path — those that start so optimistically don't seem to end so
sadly. But relationships often take this pattern, so it makes sense
that someone's finally taken this approach, and Gordon does
quite well at it.
Although she writes the material, Gordon has the sense to sur
round herself with talented collaborators, from the aforemen
tioned Bob R<xk to Jon Bt ion — an instrumentalist extraor
dinare who seems to be on every great American album of the last
few years (Fiona Apple, Eels, Elliot Smith, Aimee Mann, Macy
Gray). Her backup band is comprised of the three members of
one-hit wonder Letters to Cleo, a band that rocks a lot harder
than its token hit "Here and Now" revealed to the radio-listening
public. Here they play restrained for the most part, with the ex
ception of Cleo/Salt-like rockers "Badway" and "Number One
Camera," which add balance to the album's ballads.
While Nina Gordon is a bit older and more mature than the
teen pop stars currently dominating the charts, her music isn't
terribly different and she has the looks to succeed on MTV, as
shown on the revealing inner album cover. An audience of music
listeners raised on the Spice Girls and Britney Spears could ben
efit from a few spins of this accessible pop disc. I found my sell re
turning to Tonight and the Rest of My Life even after I had
enough to write this review, and t hat's a rare thing in an age when
most albums quickly slip from memory after the laser shuts oil.
