# 'Les Masquerades' proves itself to be a winning farce
## 
### STACY WAGNER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Les Masquerades" is like a good sitcom.
You're pretty sure you've seen the same
idea done before and have probably heard
the same jokes before, but you still end up
laughing through the entire performance
and enjoying yourself. Though truly an
original French farce, "Les Masq" feels like
one of Shakespeare's lesser-known works
revived. And it's easier to understand.
What is the driving force behind the
character switches, mistaken identity, frus
trated actions and passionate speeches that
define "Les Masq"? Of course, it is love. As
the play is set in 1672 Paris, love is not a
thing so easily had by the upper or lower
class; at least, as long as they want it with
one another. Such is the case here. The
story commences with Jean-Paul Poulet
(Peter Brightman) mourning his sad state
of infatuation with Marie Manoir (Katie
Hemmeter), the daughter of the man for
whom he's spent the past seven years as
valet.
The gardener, Pierre Pom me de Terre
(Lawrence Radecker), only makes Jean-
Paul feel worse because he is happily in
love with a woman of his station. But don't
pity poor Jean-Paul for long. He has de
vised a way to win his love. If only he pre
tended to be a marquis, he reasons, he
would be able to impress Marie with both
his eloquence (for he has never had the
courage to speak with her) and the illusion
of monetary wealth. .As a marquis, he calls
himself the Marquis de Papier-Monnaie

(Wayne Sobon). The names in the play, if
you haven't noticed already, are one of its
most entertaining aspects.
The character switches are done ex
tremely creatively, causing the audience
members to become confused along with
the characters themselves. Writer/director
Kenn Adams' decision to do the switches in
a way too difficult for me to describe here
actually made me wonder why I had never
seen it done before.
Though Adams' storyline is not exactly
original, there is a healthy amount ol self
mockery in the play. Adams knows that the
French accents which a few of his charac
ters assume could more likely he described
as "Euro-mutt," and a line in the play
refers to it. 112 le also jokes on how over-the
top some of the characters are, particular
ly the Marquis de Papier-Monnaie. The
Marquis' lines are ridiculous hut absolute
ly hilarious. Believing intelligence is syn
onymous with the ability to speak allitera
tively, the Marquis methodically and melo
dramatically mouths meditations on the
magnificence of both land masses and
Manoir's maid.
A notably excellent touch was the addi
tion of a live violinist, Ben Roberts. Fid
dling solo before the performance and
during intermission, his timely strokes at
tense moments during the play made it all
the more exciting.
"Les Masq" doesn't showcase the best
actors, but almost all performed passion
ately and seemed to be enjoying them
selves. With virtually no props and the
smallest stage 112 have ever seen, the actors

made the most of their abilities and the
well-written farce. A woman sitting in front
of me shouted, "This is brilliant!" at one
especially funny moment. I don't know if I
would go that far, but if you want to find
out, there's no doubt you'll have a good
time in the effort.
