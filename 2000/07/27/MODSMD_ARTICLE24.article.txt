# String Cheese is too bland in concert
## 
### Steven Raphael SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
There's nothing quite like an
evening concert in an outdoor the
atre, particularly when the audi
ence is really moving. As one gazes
across the arena, the throngs of
people almost create the visual ef
fect of an ocean as they bob up and
down, each in their own rhythm,
yet forming an overall pattern .
At a concert like The String
Cheese Incident's at the Creek
Theatre on Friday, July 22, there
was even more novelty to entertain
an observer. High in the stands,
huge rings swirlled around and
around the hips of hula hooping
fans. Clow sticks, some in exotic
shapes, lit the darkness with neon
colors.
A painter, grungy and stained
with oils, was given his own plat
form where he worked through
out the night creating swirling
masses of color. When he finished
a painting, he held it high over

head, slowly turning to show the
audience, who responded with
loud cheers. Soon, his painting was
aglow under the watchful eye of a
blacklight.
Of course, there was also a
downside to being a part of the
crowd at that show. Let's be hon
est, String Cheese Incident fans
smoke more pot and have worse
body odor than fans of any other
band (yes, including the Dead and
Phish). Plus, there's a significant
representation of middle aged
people, who, of course, have to
smoke twice as much as everyone
else so they can jump around awk
wardly, bumping into nearby peo
ple and proving that they are still
hip.
So, really, people who choose to
come to these concerts do so for
one of three reasons. First, there
are groupies â€” those dedicated
souls who make a lifestyle out of
following a band. They tend to be
the dirtiest, grungiest ones, wear
ing hippie clothing and carrying

scraps of paper in their pockets on
which they intently keep records of
the set list of every show .
Second, there are the people
looking for an outing into the cul
ture of jam bands. This includes
the older people, but also the stu
dents who like to hang out with the
groupies once in a while, maybe
for the drugs, maybe for the open
ness and hippie attitude.
Finally, there are those who
just love the music. At Friday's
concert, these were the ones who
were disappointed by the show.
These were the ones who noticed
that the band didn't seem togeth
er, that nearly all of the solos
dragged on until all sense of song
had been destroyed, that the
band spent way too much time in
new-agey, synthetically driven,
Pink-Floyd-esque explorations.
These were the fans who noticed
that Michael Kang's mandolin
was turned down too low to be
heard for most of the night and
that he hardly picked lip his vio

lin at all, that Kyle
Hollingsworth's taste in keyboard
tone had become dangerously
slanted towards '80s synth and
how the improvisations, particu
larly those by guitarist Bill Ner
shi, returned to the same licks
time and time again.
While the rest of the audience
was hail-nakedly dancing the
night away, these were the people
who were left wondering if the
band had always sounded like
this, and if so, why they had liked
it.
These were the people who
were left questioning if the band
had ever been good or if they had
just seemed novel. These were
the people who still bought a I -
shirt, and who knew that in a
month when they put their String
Cheese tapes on again they'd like
them as much as ever. But they
were also the people who knew
that the tapes captured the ab
solute best of the group in a way
that this concert couldn't.
