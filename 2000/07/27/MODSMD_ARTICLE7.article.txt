## Menlo Marguerite line cut as freshmen bid cars farewell 
### VICTORIA DAVIS VICTORIA DAVIS 
The pending termination of the Stanforcl-
Menlo line of the Marguerite shuttle is raising con
cerns for the future of public transportation at
Stanford. After July 28, riders of the Menlo line will
have to find other means of getting to campus.
Negotiations are still in progress and the fu
ture of the line remains uncertain. The other half
of the route, which shuttles from the Menlo Park
Caltrain station to Sand Hill Road, will continue
to run.
On July IS, the Transport Division of Menlo
Park's Development Services Dept. presented a
five page report to the City Council at their meet
ing. The report detailed alternatives to complete
ly terminating the Menlo shuttle. A group of
Stanford graduate students and employees spoke
on behalf of keeping the Menlo-Stanford line ac
tive. Four out of five of the council members were
in favor of supporting the case of the Menlo rid
ers. Despite this, Menlo Park Transportation
Manager Jamal Rahimi closed the discussion, ar
guing that the Menlo-Stanford line was financial
ly unviable.
In light of last weeks' meeting, Menlo riders
are now once again turning their hopes to Stan
ford. Supporters of the Menlo-Stanford shuttle
will focus their lobbying efforts on obtaining fi
nancial assistance from the University.
Students, staff and employees in support of the
shuttle remain optimistic and are still thinking of
additional alternatives to the situation. Vin de
Silva, a postdoctoral fellow in the Mathematics
Department, suggests that changes could be
made to the existing Palo Alto Caltrain route.
"These buses could be subsidized and have the
route extended an extra 10 minutes to service
Menlo commuters," he said.
Usage of the Menlo shuttle has been steadily
increasing since its inception three years ago, ris
ing from 74 riders per day in 1997 to 120 this
year.

The commotion surrounding the
Menlo-Stanford line cancellation has
brought new attention to the freshman
transportation situation. Beginning this
autumn, freshmen will not be allowed to
have cars on campus.
If kept running, the shuttle would be
able to service the new population of
freshmen without cars. Without the
line, freshmen will have to rely on other
options the University says it plans to
provide.
Some freshmen have positive expec
tations for their earless first years at
Stanford. Incoming freshman Diana
Banks, from Columbus, Ca., is one of
them. Banks said she will not mind not
having a car her first year. "I think that
freshmen should stay on campus and
get to know their school and classmates
before they go running off into the city,"
she said. "I want to get to know what's on
campus and what's available to me."
Banks also plans to actively take ad
vantage of the alternatives that will be of
fered, such as Webvan, which was pilot
ed spring quarter, and the Emergency
Ride Program. Both programs should
be in effect by the time freshmen arrive
in the fall.
Despite the cancellation of the Menlo
line due to financial constraints (see ac
companying article), the University has
also said it plans to expand Stanford's
Marguerite lines.
It is the hope of administrators that
Stanford students will become more
open to public transportation in the fu
ture. They feel that the programs they
are implementing to give freshmen
more flexibility will benefit all students.

Vice Provost
of Student Af
fairs James
Montoya said
"all programs
have been for
malized ex
cept for the
on-cam pus
car rental."
The Stan
ford Book
store, pro
posed site of
an on-campus
car rental ser
vice, is in con
tinued nego
tiation with
vend ors .
Specifics on
all programs

will be revealed next month in time for
residence staff training.
Jerrin West, a former resident assis
tant, agrees with the new car policy.
"Fortunately, Stanford is very good at
providing alternatives for getting
around," West said. "However, it seems
as if the freshmen will just ask upper
classmen without cars to buy them per
mits. As a former RA, I can see that the
residential staffs with freshmen are
going to have to increase programming
within the dorm since many of them will
be stranded."
Montoya will attend RA and resident
fellow training next month to ensure
that all concerned will be prepared to
address the needs of their residents.
Residence halls w ill receive new funds to
promote innovative and interactive pro
gramming for students so that they will

not feel stuck on campus. The Universi
ty is aiming for a "community that is less
dependent on cars," Montoya said.
Administrators say they do not feel
freshmen obtaining illicit permits will he
a problem. Montoya believes in the in
tegrity of Stanford's students. He has
faith in the Stanford community and
feels that it will make the best of the new
changes and uphold the Fundamental
Standard.
"We should assume that students will
see the new policy as reasonable and will
choose not to violate it," stated Montoya.
Troy Gilbert, Assistant to the Vice
Provost of Student Affairs, noted that
"nothing is set in stone. We want to have
continued dialogue with students to
come up with other possibilities. We will
definitely be reevaluating these pro
grams in the future."
