### GREG BRAZEAL EDITORIAL STAFF 
The 51-day strike by nurses at Stan
ford and Packard hospitals may end
today if the nurses' union, the Commit
tee for Recognition of Nursing Achieve
ment (CRONA), votes to accept a com
promise proposed by a federal mediator.
The potential settlement, accepted by
hospital negotiators last week, includes a
5 percent raise each year for two years.
"The hospital's prepared to accept
the federal mediator's proposed settle
ment and would welcome our muses
back," Stanford spokesman Ben Drew
told the SF Fxaininer.
The strike began on June 7 with nurs
es from ilie Stanford Medical (-enter and
Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospi
tal demanding a 21.5 percent raise over
two years, but at the time of the media

tor's proposal last week they had low
ered their expectations to 15 percent.
Drew told the Palo Alto Weekly on June
28 that the hospitals' initial offer of 8 per
cent over two years would be their final
position, and until last week negotiators
had refused to budge.
The proposed two-year contract, pre
sented to the nurses at meetings on Mon
day and Tuesday, also offers an addi
tional 2 percent raise for nurses with
over 15 years of service. In addition, a re
view mechanism would be established to
address concerns over staffing issues,
and nurses who found themselves phys
ically unable to provide sale patient care
would be permitted to decline overtime
assignments.
Felix Barthelemy, vice president ol
human resources .it Stanford Hospital
and Clinics, told The Stanford Report
that nurses could return to work as earlv

as next week if CRONA agrees to the
contract, and that the hospital is already
working with CRONA leadership on the
re-entry process. He also said that by the
second year of the contract full-time
nurses earning the average hourly rate
would have an annual salary of $77,000
a year.
In the past, CRONA has disputed the
hospital's salary calculations, claiming
that the average nurse at Stanford makes
$55,544 a year in contrast to manage
ment's claim of $69,680.
There were 1,780 nurses who partici
pated in the initial walk-out on June 7.
