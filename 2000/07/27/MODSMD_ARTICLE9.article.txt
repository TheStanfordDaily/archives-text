# Stein takes the helm as Board of Trustees' new chair
## 
### DENNIS TYLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
"Stanfbrd is clearly a veiy strong Universi
ty," said Isaac Stein, new chair of the Board of
Trustees. "Under the leadership of Bob Bass
and Cierhard (iisper, Stanford has enhanced
undergraduate education and increased fi
nancial resources. Those now taking leader
ship must really lx*gin capitalizing on the for
ward momentum to make the University even
stronger."
Capitalizing on Stanford's momentum is
exactly what Isaac Stein plans to do.
Stein, a board member since 1994, suc
ceeds Robert Bass as the new chair of the
Board of Trustees. Although Bass' allotted
time as chair had ended, he will remain a
member of the Board for his second five-year
term. Stein is president and founder of Wa
verly Associates Inc., a private investment linn
in Palo Alto, where he lives.
"I do not believe that the University needs
a lx»ld new direction. I feel that it simply needs
to build on its strengths," said Stein.
Building on its strengths, however, does
not include making students members of the
Board of Trustees, like other top administra
tors, such as University President Gerhard
Casper and Provost John Hennessy, Stein
feels diat students are sufficiently represented
on the committees affiliated wit h die Board.
"Personally, I do not believe it makes
sense to have students be members of the
Board of Trustees. It takes years to under

stand the complexity of the Trustee role,
which is why trustees are nominated lor live
year terms. Secondly, trustees are not repre
sentational. There are no members who are
there to represent any particular group. Ad
ditionally, the Board of Trustees does jiot
manage the day-to-day operations of the
University, but rather we handle the long
range problems of Stanford."
According to Stein, students would not Ix*
able to focus on long-term issues as keenly as
alumni trustees would lx> able to. He concedes
that a certain level of detachment is required
for trustees to ensure the future prosperity of
the University.
"Students and faculty would tend to focus
more on present situations involving Stanford
rather that long-range goals. Members of the
Board need detachment from the University
so that [they don't get too caught up in the
emotional aspect of the University]," Stein
said.
Stein insists there are two criteria that
members of the Board of the Trustees must
meet. "Members of the Board must have an
earnest commitment to Stanford because
there are no financial benefits to being in
volved in the Board of Trustees," said Stein.
"They must also have demonstrated accom
plishment in a particular area or field. We are
looking for people who will bring their high
level of skill and expertise to the Board."
Stein says he is committed to listening to
student concerns. "The Board very much wel
comes spending time with students and hear

ing student issues," he said.
Stein, a Stanford graduate, received his
MBA and law degrees from Stanford in 1972
and holds a bachelor's from Colgate Universi
ty. Since coming to Stanford, Stein has served
on numerous committees. He served on the
search committee diat recommended Hen
nessey as the new president of Stanford. He
has also served as chairman of the boards of
UCSF Stanford Health (".are and of Stanford's
I lealth Services and was a member of the Law
School Board of Visitors.
As a member of die National Advisory
Board of Stanford's Haas (x.*nter for Public
Service, Stein asserts that he "has always be
lieved strongly in public service. I feel diat
public service gready benefits die University."
In fact, Stanford encourages the Board of
Trustees to rememlier that the ultimate goal
of the University is to share resources with the
outside community.
"Stanford has made it clear to trustees that
the purpose of the University is to enhance the
larger community lieyond Stanford," said
Stein.
Stein is not concerned about top adminis
trators changing positions. 1 fe remains confi
dent dial die c hange will be smooth because
Hennessy and Philosophy Prof. John
Etchemendy, the incoming provost, have
been involved widi the University lor many
years as faculty.
"A university is a very flexible organization.
They don't operate in a top-down manner.
The decision process is a very collaborative

process. The greatest strength [about the
change in administration! is that the new ad
ministration has been affiliated with Stanford
for a long time. Uennessy and Etchemendy
will bring an established trust to die Universi
ty," said Stein.
Widi such comfort with die new adminis
tration, Stein believes that the future prosper
ity of Stanford will remain in tact
"When 1 first came to Stanford, I was
changing light bulbs. But I loved it because
I thought I had arrived at a magical place.
Thirty-two years later, 1 can safely say that
I feel the same way about the University.
I'm honored to take part in continuing
Stanford's excellence."
