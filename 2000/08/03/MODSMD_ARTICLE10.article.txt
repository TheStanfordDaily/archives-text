## 
### DENNIS TYLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
After eight years with the University, Geoffrey Cox, vice
provost for institutional planning, learning technology and ex
tended education, will leave Stanford for an Internet education
company.
Unext.com has hired Cox as vice president of academic af
tnirs and continuing education. Additionally, he will serve as
provost of Cardean University, the online educational institu
tion of die Illinois-based company.
Cox, 44, states that his reason for leaving Stanford has to
Jo with his growing interest in expanding education
through the Internet.
"I am joining Unext.com because 1 have grown very inter
ested in the potential of the Internet to expand educational op
portunities to people who otherwise would not have them,"
â€¢aid Cox. "We are at a very earl) stage in the development of
ihis new approach to education. Unext.com offers me a chance
to play a significant role in helping to shape the future of this
new enterprise. It's a unique opportunity."
Last year, Stanford was one of five universities that joined
Unext.com to develop online courses. A handful of Stanford of
ficials, along widi Cox, represented the University during ne
gotiations with the company.
But Unextcom's chairman and chief executive officer, Andy
Rosenfield, confirms that the hiring of Cox was purely coinci
dental. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the compa
ny harbored no plans to hire Cox at the time its deal with Stan
ford was being made. Even though many higher-education fig
ures are being lured to the for-profit side of online education,
Rosenfield said, "It's unlikely we will hire another senior acad
emic."
Along with Stanford, Unext.com's partners are Carnegie
Mellon University, Columbia University, the London School of
Economics and Political Science and the University of Chicago.
Each institution is estimated to have a stake worth at least $20
million.
While working for the company, Cox said he would be

"helping to complete the development of the business and
management courses Unext.com is currently working on. I will
also start working on programs in other disciplines."
University President Gerhard Casper, who will step down as
president on Sept.l, recruited Cox to Stanford as vice provost
tor institutional planning and operations. Having entered
Stanford at the same time, Casper is appreciative of Cox's hard
work for the University.
"In GeofFs eight years here, he has made important
contributions across a vast number of areas in the Univer
sity, among them budget and finance, facilities operations,
distance education and learning technology. But for me,"
Casper told the Stanford Report "his most significant con
tribution has come in the area of improving undergradu
ate education, where he has been an indispensable ally. I
wish Geoll the best in his new position, and although we
will miss him at Stanford, I know that he will remain a good
friend and colleague."
Other top administrators agree that they will miss the im
provements Cox has made to Stanford.
"Cox played a key role in creating a new campus-wide orga
nization to address the challenges Stanford faces in both using
technology in teaching and in distance education. His role in
organizing activities across campus was key, and we will miss his
thoughtful contributions," said Provost John Hennessy.
What has not yet been determined is who will replace Cox.
"Although we plan to continue to be active in this area, we
are reviewing our activities and plans across the University be
fore deciding how best to replace Cox and organize for the fu
ture," said Hennessy.
Although Cox will be leaving Stanford, he will still be based
in Palo Alto and admits that his time at Stanford has been ex
tremely special.
"1 will miss working at Stanford. I've been here eight years
and have developed lots of close associations with people here.
I'm glad that I'll continue to live in the area and hope to con
tinue some of those close contacts. Stanford has a relationship
with Unext.com, so I will have reasons to continue to be on cam
pus," said Cox.
