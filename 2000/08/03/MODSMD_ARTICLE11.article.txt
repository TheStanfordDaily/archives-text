### DENNIS TYLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
"The Stanford magazine is, by far, the
best alumni magazine in the country," said
Kevin Cool, the new editor of Stanford mag
azine. "It has such a terrific staff and an in
credibly high readership It is the best job
in the country for an editor."
Beginning in September, Cool, the edi
tor of Stanford Lawyer for the past 18
months, will serve as the new editor of Stan
ford magazine after a long and thorough
search by a search committee led by
William E. Stone, president of Stanford
Alumni Association.
Since last winter, when former editor Bob
Cohn left the magazine for Industry Stan
dard, Mark Robinson, managing editor of
Stanford magazine, has been serving as act
ing editor.
"We selected Kevin to be our new editor
after a comprehensive national search. He
has a lot of experience to bring to the maga
zine among the high level of applicants that
we received and definitely made a good im
pression on us," said Stone.
Cool's 20 years of experience as a writer
and editor earned him the new position.
Prior to working at Stanford Lawyer, Cool
was the editor of a magazine at Colby College
in Maine. He also served as the communica
tion director at a quarterly magazine at Cen
tral College in lowa.
With such experience, Stone feels confi

dent that Cool will maintain the high level of
success that the magazine has had over the
years.
"I view Stanford magazine as the crown
jewel publication for Stanford. We anticipate
that Kevin will keep the magazine a top in its
field," said Stone.
Likewise, Cool feels comfortable that he
will enjoy the new environment at the mag
azine. He is currently in the process of
meeting his new fellow staff members.
"So far, I have been so impressed indi
vidually and collectively with the commit
ment of the staff. ... I feel that I can add a
lot to the magazine," said Cool.
Currently the co-chairman of CASE
(Council for Advancement and Support of
Education) Editors Forum, a national con
ference for college and university editors,
Cool has won numerous CASE awards in
recent years. The lowa Newspaper Associ
ation and the Associated Press Managing
Editors have also honored him.
Cool says that his excitement about his
job comes from his strong understanding
of the importance of education.
"1 feel very strongly about the value of
education. I feel that I have a spiritual
connection to it," said Cool.
Ann Dethlefsen, the director of Commu
nications for the Law School, feels that Cool
will be successful at Stanford magazine.
"This is an incredibly exciting opportu
nity for Kevin. I can't imagine being any
thing but thrilled for him. He is very sensi

tive to the needs of his audience and their
stories," said Dethlefsen. "When he came
to the Stanford Lawyer, the magazine
needed revamping. But Kevin managed to

take the magazine to another level by giv
ing it a more modern feel and fresher lan
guage. I know he'll bring these same qual
ities to the Stanford magazine."
