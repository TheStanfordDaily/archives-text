## DAILY VIEWPOINT Washington D.C. is no Wonderland for Alice 
### ALICE BROWN STAFF COLUMNIST 
I am feeling excessively cranky. Foul
tempered. Bitter. When I sat down to write
this week's column, I vowed that it would be
about something deep and meaningful. A
current event. A serious issue. But I was un
able to gather information from any news
paper because I have severely adverse reac
tions to any news involving the Republican
National Convention, the city of Philadel
phia, Dick "I'm really boring" Cheney or
George "of course I'm qualified to be presi
dent, do you know who my father is?" Bush.
The only other news that the media cares
about is the Brad "Hottest" Pitt / Jennifer
"yes I eat — carrots" Aniston wedding. And
that's too depressing to write about.
So the topic I keep coming back to is my
mental state, which is poor. Why am I so ir
ritable? For the following reasons:
1. It is so humid in Washington D.C.
that it is necessary to wear bathing gear at
all times while outside. My hair, even when

freshly washed, looks like some winged
creature moved in and made a nest.
2. I take the bus to work every morning,
which would be fine, except for the fact
that my busses are always a) very VFRY
late b) lacking that convenient feature —
air conditioning — or c) so full that I'm al
ways squashed against the wall, forced to
put half my body out the window in order
to breathe and then often asphyxiated by
the toxic fumes coming either from the
garbage truck driving next to the bus or
from the person next to me.
3. Work really isn't all that bad. I have my
own office, phone, computer, etc. I sit in my
office staring at my computer (sometimes
switching to staring at my phone) all day
every day for nine hours. I e-mail a lot. I wait
for people to e-mail me back. No one ever
does. (Sometimes I get an e-mail from
abc.soaps.update@abc.com — that's pretty
exciting.) I call people — and leave mes
sages. No one calls me back. There are six
other interns who are nice, but they hate me.
Yesterday I found out that they have a secret

intern e-mail list that I'm not on. Sweet.
Yeah, so scratch that. Work is sub-par.
4. So after work I try to make myself go
exercise. One of three things inevitably
happens: a) I don't, b) I go straight to the
gym from work and realize I've forgotten
socks, or one sneaker, or a t-shirt, or shorts
or all of the above, c) I get to the gym, man
age to change, heave myself on to the near
est treadmill, start running and immedi
ately trip due to my fatigue level and gen
eral lack of coordination. This is so embar
rassing that, in terms of exercise, I often go
with option a.
5. Once home I'm faced with dozens of
thrilling activities, including a) changing
the rabbit cage b) talking to my parents c)
watching TV d) going to bed. If ever forced
to go with option b, I try to combine it with
c or d. Usually d.
6. Going to bed so early means that I
don't fall asleep right away and am there
fore forced to ponder massively depressing
issues such as what I might want to do with
my life. My mom thinks I should move to

Kenya and be a hyena or some furry-ani
mal researcher. "Wouldn't it be thrilling?"
she says. My dad thinks I should switch my
major to economics and go work on Wall
Street. "Wouldn't it be exciting?" he says.
Unfortunately I find the ideas of spending
the rest of my life with wildebeest and
stockbrokers equally unappealing.
What do I want to be? Julia Roberts. An ac
tress? No. I want to BE Julia. You can imag
ine all the logistical problems this presents.
So, yeah, I could've written about
weighty matters, such as the disappoint
ment of Condi's Convention speech lack
ing a Stanford shout-out. Or the distress
ing appearance of John McCain's neck —
does anyone else think it looks on the verge
of exploding? Yet, as I have stated, I am
too cranky. Please send loving thoughts my
way — or if you can't be bothered, at least
send tips on being Julia.
