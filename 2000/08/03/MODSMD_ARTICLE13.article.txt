# DAILY VIEWPOINT
## Following your heart 
### GIL LOPEZ STAFF COLUMNIST 
It took long enough, but I finally found it.
Yes, I'll be the first to admit that when I
decided to forgo a life of computer science
and go into journalism I was worried, in
the sense that my stomach was twisting into
knots that would put a contortionist to
shame. I mean, on the one hand we've got
guaranteed work and a hefty paycheck in
Silicon Valley — which I believe is Latin for
"ridiculously affluent" — and on the other
we have professional writing, where for
every Pulitzer Prize awarded you have
maybe 1,000 hacks sitting in a hotel room
somewhere, basting themselves in
whiskey.
Think of your freshman dorm, then
take away the education, fun and socializ
ing and focus on the insecurities and binge
drinking. That was kind of my worst-case
scenario for this whole writing thing. Let's
face it, Fitzgerald and Hemingway may be
revered for their literature, but that's not
the way I want to go out.
Sitting in front of a computer screen one
night junior year, staring at line after line
of code, I just snapped. I'm not talking
about a change of heart, I mean a full-on,
Jerry Maguire, "The fish is coming with
me" type of epiphany.
I remember calling my parents, telling
them I had no idea where my life was
going. I cried as if I had contracted my life

over to Bill Gates, or the way little Timmy
would cry if they ever pulled an Old Yeller
on Lassie.
It's unfair. Some people never agonize
about their futures. Some people can pic
ture exactly where they'll lie on Nov. 29,
2023. Some people know what they'll be
wearing on Nov. 29, 2023. I look down at
least live times a day just to make sure my
socks match my shirt.
But those other people... These are the
same people who always knew where they
were going to school. This person sits
down at age 5 and makes out a simple to
do list.
* Get straight A's.
* Go to Harvard undergrad.
* Go to Harvard law and / or medical.
* Save the world.
* Rule the world.
My list at age 5 was more like this:
* Steal a popsicle from the fridge.
* Do something idiotic with my friends
that would ensure a hospital trip for at least
one of us.
* DO NOT wet the bed.
Why do I lack direction? Why is it that I
feel I could end up living with my parents
in a year, and yet not really feel any fear?
(Trust me, living with my parents is
something to fear.)
But I can laugh now. I've paid my dues
on the Ferris wheel that is career anxiety
and I know I've ended up in the right spot.
Sure, the pay's not through-the-roof, and

there are more dues to pay and ropes to go
through than at a fraternity hazing in Dart
mouth, but it's a small price to pay for hap
piness and peace of mind.
Maybe there's nothing in this for you.
I'm not saying I would have been selling
my soul by sticking with programming
(read: if there are any lucrative startups
out there with an offer, I'm listening), it's
just that I had to go with passion, not ex
pectations or money. •
Let's face it, deep down inside there's al
ways something most of us wish we had done
differently. I'll admit that journalism isn't
my ultimate dream job, but I've come to
terms with the fact that I'll never play center

field for the Los Angeles Dodgers, especially
now that they've traded for Tom Goodwin.
Anyway, there's something exhilarating
in taking on your goals. I'm not turning
heads on the Pulitzer committee with the
work I'm doing here at The Oregonian,
but it's writing, and it's a start. And I know
it's the right path for me to follow. Lists? 1
don't need a list to plan, I just follow my
heart.
Though, I know that somewhere in the
back of my mind, I'm still worried about
wetting the bed.
