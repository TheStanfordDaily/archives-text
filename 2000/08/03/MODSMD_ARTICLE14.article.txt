## Borchard leaves Stanford for White Sox 
### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
So long, Joe.
The hopes of Stanford football fans everywhere
took a turn for the worst last Friday when Joe Bor
chard, the presumed starting quarterback for the
2000 season, announced that he had signed a profes
sional baseball contract with the Chicago White Sox.
The White Sox selected Borchard — a right field

been $3 million from Florida to No. 1 choice Adrian
Gonzalez, while former Stanford teammate Justin
Wayne received $2.95 million from Montreal at No.

years down the road, it was very difficult to give up
something like football. Not only football itself, but
also the loyalty toward the program with the play
ers, coaches and support staff. It was very difficult
to leave that."
During his final baseball season at Stanford, Bor
chard endured massive speculation regarding his fu
ture, taking questions on the subject after seemingly
every game. He took part in spring football drills
while also manning right field for the Cardinal, even
playing in the spring football game and against Cali-
