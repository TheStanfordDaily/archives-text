## Borchard leaves Stanford for White Sox 
### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
So long, Joe.
The hopes of Stanford football fans everywhere
took a turn for the worst last Friday when Joe Bor
chard, the presumed starting quarterback for the
2000 season, announced that he had signed a profes
sional baseball contract with the Chicago White Sox.
The White Sox selected Borchard — a right field
er — 12th overall in the June amateur draft and ap
parently convinced him not to return to Stanford by
giving him the largest signing bonus for a player
signing with the team that originally drafted him.
According to Baseball America, Borchard will get
$5.3 million, to be paid out over the next 2 1/2 years,
beginning with a $1.25 million payment right away.
The contract calls for additional payments of $1.25
million in 2001, $ 1.3 million in 2002 and $ 1.5 million
in 2003.
The previous record amount was $3.96 million
for high school outfielder Josh Hamilton, who was
picked No. 1 overall by Tampa Bay in 1999. For the

sake of comparison, this year's highest bonus had
been $3 million from Florida to No. 1 choice Adrian
Gonzalez, while former Stanford teammate Justin
Wayne received $2.95 million from Montreal at No.
5 overall.
"Last night, I made one of the toughest deci
sions I ever had to make," said Borchard during a
conference call with the media Friday evening.
"Typically, one of the toughest decisions is to de
cide what college to go to after high school. Three
years down the road, it was very difficult to give up
something like football. Not only football itself, but
also the loyalty toward the program with the play
ers, coaches and support staff. It was very difficult
to leave that."
During his final baseball season at Stanford, Bor
chard endured massive speculation regarding his fu
ture, taking questions on the subject after seemingly
every game. He took part in spring football drills
while also manning right field for the Cardinal, even
playing in the spring football game and against Cali-

fornia at Sunken Diamond in the
same day.
Soon after getting drafted, Bor
hard expressed a desire to play
Doth football and professional
baseball in the summer, as football
players like Ricky Williams (with
the Phillies) and Drew Henson
(with the Yankees and now Reds)
had done previously. The White
Sox would not make such an al
lowance, however, and so negotia
tions dragged on into August.
"I knew that being drafted by

the Chicago White Sox would not
allow me to play football," said
Bore hard, who was working out at
Stanford with other members of
the football team. "But I had to
prepare to play football like I
would in a normal year in case
something didn't work out."
Borchard recently completed
his junior season in baseball on the
Farm, batting .333 with career
highs in home runs (19) and RBI
(76) during 66 games in the 2000
season. His offense helped lead the
Cardinal to the College World Se
ries in Omaha, where the team fin
ished second to LSU.
Major league scouts had long
been salivating over his smooth

swing and exceptional power, in
addition to solid defense in the out
field.
"We are ecstatic to have Joe join
our organization," said Duane
Shaffer, White Sox director of
scouting. "1 said before the draft
that if we pic ked first in the coun
try, Joe still would have been my
choice. In my opinion, he showed
us the best power from a college
player since Mark McGwire."
After spending some time at
Chicago's minor league camp in
Arizona, Borchard will move on to
Class A Burlington for the remain
der of the minor league season,
where he will move from his nor
mal light field spot to center field.
