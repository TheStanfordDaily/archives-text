# Long year for football just got longer

### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Coming off an unbelievable year for his football
team, Stanford head coach Tyrone Willingham knew
repeating as Pacific 10 conference champs would be a
tall order, given the loss of his starting quarterback and
top wide receiver. At least, the coach probably figured,
he'd have a solid backup choice in Joe Borchard to take
over at QB lor the next year.
Scratch that plan.
Borchard's decision to leave Stanford for the Chica
go White Sox and the riches of professional baseball
puts a serious crimp in the team's hopes of merely com
peting in a Pac-1() that will be much tougher next sea
son.

"I think being a quarterback is one of most difficult
things to give up because of the special intangibles you
have to bring to the team," said Borchard, who had two
years of eligibility left, after announcing his decision.
"Being in huddle and having the other players look at
you to lead them is a unique and special experience.
Being a quarterback is very special, but I'm happy to
give it up now to be with the Chicago White Sox."
Borchard is far from the first quarterback to face
such a decision â€” in fact, he's not even the first Stan
ford quarterback to do so. Chad Hutchinson, who
started under center for two years from 1996-1997,
pitched for the Stanford baseball team and was drafted
by the St. Louis Cardinals in the second round of
1998's amateur draft. With one year
of eligibility left, he bolted for base
ball with a four year, $3.5 million
contract in tow.
Losing Hutchinson was expected
to leave a huge hole, but Todd
Husak took over as the starter in
1998 and endured one so-so year
before leading the Cardinal to the
Rose Bowl last season.
While he only started one game
last year, Borchard showed flashes
of significant ability on the field, in
dicating he could perhaps follow
Husak the way Husak followed
Hutchinson.

Replacing an injured Husak in
the second quarter against UCLA,
all Borchard did was throw for 324
yards on 15-of-19 passing in two and
a half quarters of play. His day in
cluded two gorgeous bombs to re
ceiver Troy Walters, one of which
was a 98-yard touchdown pass that
broke the school record for longest
TD reception.
The next week against San Jose
State, Borchard drew his only start,
and while he was somewhat less than
sharp he still managed to throw for
313 yards in a loss to the Spartans
that was more the defense's fault
than his own.
Borchard didn't play significant
ly again until spring football practice
started up in April, where he and

Rancly Fasani "competed" for a job
that was sure to be Borchard's in the
fall.
Now Fasani finds himself thrust
into the starter's position after a re
markably quiet two-year career,
where he will be pressed to live up to
the ghost of Borchard and questions
about what the baseball star could
have accomplished had he stayed.
He won't be lacking in confi
dence; following a solid perfor
mance in the spring football scrim
mage, Fasani said he thought he
had proven he could play at a con
sistent level, and that "It's my time to
play quarterback... I want to show
my skills."
Come September, Stanford fans
will hope that Fasani is right.
