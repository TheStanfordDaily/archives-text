The A's just can't pack them in. In
the midst of Pokemon-mania, the
seemingly lucrative promotion of
Pokemon Hat Day should have
packed the Coliseum — but they could only
draw a little over 20,000. Even with the
team's recent threats to move to Santa Clara
County or even out of the Bay Area, the fans
have failed to respond.
Monday night's toe-to-toe matchup of
pitching All-Stars David Wells and Tim
Hudson barely attracted 13,000 fans. How
can this be? These games should have been
attendance highs for the A's, but instead they
were outright embarrassments.
Going to an A's game is frustrating for
any true baseball fan. Oakland doesn't play
fundamental baseball, which undercuts
their potential to be a young but dominat
ing force in the game. Instead, they are

fighting for a wild card spot and lead the
American League in some of its "worst" cat
egories, such as batting average (.268) and
errors (94). Their formula for success has
been lead off walk -I- home run = quick
runs. The team has failed to capitalize on
hits and isn't driving in runners when
they're not smacking homers.
Of course, General Manager Billy Beane
built the A's this way. He first looked at
slugging percentages and worried about
defensive skills second. Luckily for Oak
land, a combination of consistent power hit
ting and a strong bullpen have them lead
ing the wild card race only three games
back in the AL West.
Ben Grieve, a first round draft pick in
1997 and die 1998 American League Rook
ie of the Year, is typical of the future of the
A's. After all, Mark McGwire won the same

accolade his rookie year. The differences be
tween Grieve and McGwire are numerous,
starting with Grieve's undeniably poor work
ethic and egregious defense.
Fans seem able to forgive Grieve's defen
sive shortcomings because they realize his
strengths lie in hitting. But it's all or nothing
with Grieve, and often it's nothing. He is hit
ting .285 with 19 home runs and 73 RBIs,
but for a first round draft pick and former
Rookie of the Year, he should be posting bet
ter batting stats. Grieve seems content to rot
in left field and pray that if a ball does come
his way thatTerrence Long will sprint out of
center field and make the catch.
Grieve seems out of step with teammates
Adam Piatt and Long, two newcomers who
are making a bigger impact on the A's. Piatt
is posting better batting stats than Grieve,
with a .368 and 15 RBIs in 21 games. Long, a

regular starter and the A's lead-off man, has
had an outstanding rookie season. Me leads
all rookies in runs scored with 65, is second in
hits with 92 and an impressive fourth in the
American League in batting with runners in
scoring position. These all make Long a con
tender for Rookie of the Year.
Add to them Miguel "How'd he do that?"
Tejada, whose defensive plays and 20 home
runs have made him a standout player. Un
fortunately, Tejada balances those incredi
ble plays with errors, as he leads the team
with 17.
But they're learning. With more playing
time, these new A's will serve as a strong sup
porting cast for All-Star Jason Giambi. With
the help of an aggressive A's media cam
paign, Giambi was voted to the 2000 All-Star
game. His consistency and experi
ence make him the team leader.
Between Grieve, Piatt, Long, Teja
da and Giambi someone always
steps up every game and delivers
in the clutch.
The hitters aren't doing it all,
though — it is Oakland's young
and strong bullpen that is winning
the close games. All-star Tim Hud
son (13-3) has been phenomenal
this year, most recently pitching a
one-hitter against Cy Young con
tender David Wells. Newcomer
Barry Zito (3-0) has been able to
get out of tough innings and over
come rookie mistakes. Closer

Jason Isringhausen and setup
man Jetl fam have finished up
the job consistently this year and
will now be joined by recent acqui
sitionjim Mecir.
The A's are clearly built to win
in the future, but fans are hoping
they will win a little now too. They
will likely make the postseason if
they keep hitting home runs and
as long as their bullpen doesn't
stumble. With a strong post season
showing and the inevitable im
provement of its young players, it
will be strong pitching and consis
tent batting, not Pokemon, that
will lure fans to the games.
