Williams dominates Davenport
in Bank of the West final to win
second tournament of the year

Let the coronation begin.
In spite of what the world rankings say, Venns
Williams is, without a doubt, the best women's tennis
player in the world, right now, at this moment.
The dominating manner in which Williams,
ranked third in the world, dismissed No. 2 Lindsay
Davenport in Sunday's Bank of the West Classic
final, b-1,6-4, served notice to the tennis world that
Venus will be the player to beat in next month's
U.S. Open, not purported No.l Martina Hingis.
Combining blistering serves with a lethal forehand
and her trademark athleticism, Williams left the
crowd at Taube Family Tennis Stadium, not to
mention her vanquished opponent, in awe of her
talents.
"She was playing so well . . . of all the times I've
played her, this was her best," said Davenport, who
had beaten Williams in the past two Bank of the West
finals before succumbing this year.
Williams also defeated Davenport in the finals at
Wimbledon last month to earn her first Crand Slam
title, giving her two titles for the year in only five tour
naments she has played. She has cleaned up the part
of the game that gave her the most trouble before —
controlling her superior speed — and now she ap
pears to be, well, unbeatable.
Asked if she thought she was No. 1, Williams said
"Not on paper. But in my mind I've always been the
best. If you go in thinking you're not the best, you'll
find yourself down 3-0."
That was certainly not the case Sunday. After both
players won games in the first set, Williams broke Dav

enport once and then broke her again in winning the
set. In the last three games, Williams lost only one
point to Davenport on a double fault in the last game,
after which she hit a nifty second serve at 40-15 that
just dropped in the corner for an ace. The first set
took but a total of 27 minutes, and Venus was well on
her way to victory.
Davenport staged a minor comeback of sorts at the
beginning of the second set, gaining her lone break
point of the day in the fourth set to go up 3-1 as
Williams seemed to have trouble getting the ball over
the net.
"It's tough when you play her on the big points.
You don't want to just get the balls in because she's so
aggressive," said Davenport. "There were a few points
where I needed to break serve or hold on in those cru
cial games, and today I wasn't able to do that."
She was speaking pointedly about that fifth game
in the second set, when Williams suddenly awakened
from her slumber and roared back into the match,
winning two games to even the set at 3-3.
Davenport managed to win one more game, but
Williams took over after that. Thanks to some of Dav
enport's 36 unforced errors, the score was s<x>n 5-4,
and Williams put her stamp on the match with a phe
nomenal 122 mph serve in the last game, the fastest
serve in the tournament and 5 mph short ol her WI A
record. Two points later, Davenport hit the net on a
return, and Venus was a champion for the second
time this year.
"You get pretty motivated after losing two years
in a row," said Williams before accepting the win
ner's trophy. "And I wanted that stuffed animal,
referring to the Bank of the West bear given to the
winner.
After the match, Venus went to center court, where
she finally got what she wanted. She grabbed the
stuffed animal and held it in her arms.
She may be the world's best player, but she's really
still just a kid, at 20 years old. And the best of Venus
Williams is vet to come.
