# Volleyball adds Tom, Walsh for Olympics
## 
### BEN ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Two member's of Stanford's 1999
NCAA runner-up women's volleyball team
will represent the United States at the
Olympic Games in September.
Senior Kerri Walsh and freshman
Logan Tom passed through the final
round of cuts last week, staking their claim
as two of the 12 women who will wear
America's red, white and blue on the court
in Sydney.
The national team was reduced to 14
prospects two weeks ago, and USA
Women's National Volleyball Head Coach
Mick Haley made the final two cuts last
Thursday. His team selection is final pend
ing approval from the U.S. Olympic Com
mittee.
"It was an extremely difficult decision,
because everyone had their own asset,"
Haley said. "We have a good mix of veter
ans and young players. That combination
gives us the best chance to go for a medal
in Sydney."
Walsh, a 6-foot-3-inch outside hitter
and setter, was the 1999 Co-National Play
er of the Year for the Cardinal, and Tom,

a H-foot-l-inch outside hitter, was the 1999
National Freshman of the Year. Stanford
fell to Penn State in the finals of the NCAA
Championships in Hawaii.
Stanford's two representatives join
three players from Long Beach State and
two from the University of Hawaii. Players
from Nebraska, Ohio State, Texas, Texas
A&M and Barry University (Fla.) till out
the squad.
While at Stanford, Walsh made history
by becoming just the second player ever to
collect American Volleyball Coaches Asso
ciation Ail-American honors four times.
Tom led Stanford in kills per game last
year at 4.63 and was the sixth Cardinal
player to gain Freshman of the Year hon
ors. She joined Walsh as a first-team All-
American, just the fourth freshman ever to
gain that status.
Both women are veterans of numerous
junior national teams.
All teams participating in the Olympics
have been separated into two pools, with
the top four teams from each pool advanc
ing to the quarterfinals. The United States
joins No. 3 Brazil, No. 4 China, No. 8

The national squad will have
one final opportunity to brush up
for the Games at a round-robin
tournament in Asia, Aug. 4-27.
There, they will play against Rus
sia, Cuba, Brazil, China, Korea
and Japan.
"This team will leave every
thing they have out on the court
for the United States," Haley said.
"We are training extremely hard
six days a week and are looking
forward to Sydney."
Volleyball Magazine ranks
Stanford sixth in the NCAA in a
preseason poll released this
week. UCLA is ranked No. 1.
Tom, the team's top returning
player, will miss a month of Stan
ford's preparation and play
while in Sydney.
Stanford begins play on Sept.
22 at a tournament in New Mexi
co. Olympic play begins Sept. 16
and concludes on Oct. 1.

Beating UCLA was tough, but Kerri Walsh will find Russia, Cuba and Brazil a lot
tougher in the Olympic volleyball tournament, beginning Sept. 16.
