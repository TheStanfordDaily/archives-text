Gosling K's side in New England
Stanford pitcher Mike Gosling struck out the side in a perfect
ninth inning as the USA national team defeated the Torrington
Twisters, 8-1. Tim Merrit (OF, So, South Alabama) hit his second
home run in as many games while driving in three runs and Len
Dinardo (LHP, So, Stetson) struck out 12 batters for team USA
last Thursday evening at Fuessenich Park in Torrington, Conn.
The win was Team USA's 12th in a row, improving the National
Team's record to 19-3 on the 2000 Qwest Red, White and Blue
Tour. Torrington, a member of the New England Collegiate Base
ball League, drops to 19-22.
Cooper home run champ of Cape
Stanford outfielder Jason Cooper won the Cape League All-Star
game home run contest. Cooper hit six home runs in the final round
for a come-from-behind victory
over defending champion Doc
Brooks of Georgia.
Brooks swatted seven bombs
into the trees and fans' awaiting

outstretched hands in round one
of the annual long ball extravagan
za, and for all intents and purposes
it appeared he would repeat his
stunning home run display of
1999.
Cooper, who is playing this
summer for the Yarmouth-Dennis
Red Sox, edged Brooks in round
two, 6-3.
