# Stember's Olympic journey takes slight detour — to Europe
## 
### BEN ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Michael Stember's journey to Sydney to compete
in the Olympic Games will be interrupted by a
stopover in Europe this month, and how the Stanford
1,500-meter runner performs in London and Zurich
could determine his Olympic fate.
Stember, the third-place finisher at the U.S.
Olympic Trials at 1,500 meters, boarded a plane
bound for London Sunday after falling just short of
the Olympic 'A' Standard of 3 minutes, 36.80 seconds
— a time he needed to meet to go to Sydney — in a
race held at Stanford on Saturday night.
He ran 3:37.43 in that race to win by almost a sec
ond, but he was well short of 3:37.04, the career-best
time he ran at the Trials.
"I did the best I could tonight," Stember said. "I
knew with 50 meters to go I was going to fall short of
the Olympic standard. I just didn't get it done tonight.
But I'll now go to Europe and run in several meets. I
will get the job done there."
High schoolers attending Stanford's summer cross
country camp lined the track to cheer Stember on. He
was paced evenly by sophomore teammate Gabe Jen
nings, the Trials' champion at 1,500 meters, before
being left alone with 200 meters to go.
The 3:37.43 effort shows that Stember is in proper
shape to better the Olympic standard. Races in Eu
rope normally provide quicker pacing, where a less
experienced runner can be dragged along to a fast
time with seemingly less effort.
The Malmo meet is scheduled for Aug. 5 in Lon
don, and the Weltklasse meet in Zurich follows on
Aug. 11. Depending upon his performance in those
meets, Stember may race again later in the month.
Ile must run under the 'A' time before Sept. 11 to
gain admittance to the Olympics. If he does not, his
spot on the Olympic team will go to the next best fin
isher at the Trials who has met the standard, fifth
place finisher Steve I lolman.

Jennings ran 3:35.90 to win the Trials and is guar
anteed a spot in Sydney.
Stanford alumnus Jason Lunn was fourth at the
Trials and is currently in Europe seeking to beat the
standard in case Stember falls short. Should both
Lunn and Stember fail to better the mark, Holman,
fifth at the Trials and a 3:31 runner, will compete for
the United States.
