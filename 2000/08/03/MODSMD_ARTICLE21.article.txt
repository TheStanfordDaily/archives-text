## Stanford Jazz Festival showcases talent and energy 
### JENN LINDSAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Jazz Festival is
winding to a close this week with this
Saturday evening's Mulgrew Miller
concert. The Festival has enjoyed a
rich history on the Stanford campus,
combining the talents and energy of
participants from professional jazz
musicians to Bay Area kids just em
barking on their musical studies.
The Stanford Jazz Festival was
founded 28 years ago as an educa
tional venture by current festival di

rector Jim Nadel. It has since ex
panded, functioning as both a work
shop environment — offering jazz
theory courses and instrumental
master classes for both teenagers
and adults, and as a concert series—
featuring such ensembles as the
Chucho Valdez Quartet, the percus
sive styling of the Berkeley-based
Josh Jones Latin Trio and several in
dividual performances.
Looking inside the Festival
Many of the performing artists,

such as Bob Murphy — a local saxo
phonist and percussionist who re
turns to the Festival for his 28th
year, also contribute their efforts as
workshop facilitators.
His July 27 show, showcasing
"Bob Murphy and Friends," pre
sented a fusion of traditional, con
temporary and Latin jazz, culminat
ing in a wild dance circle to the
sounds of guest artist Batterie Tam
bour and an Afro-Cuban drum en
semble.
From the evening's start, Mur
phy's constantly-evolving ensemble

worked in tight rhythms and care
fully orchestrated transitions be
tween solos, with Murphy simulta
neously leading the band and wail
ing on his saxophone. Although his
opening set featured a mellow com
bination of vibes, upright bass and
Murphy's careening saxophone
solos, ensemble members and in
struments constantly rotated, ulti
mately introducing piano, guitar,
trombone, trumpet and legendaiy
jazz drummer Albert "Tootie"
Heath to achieve a funkolicious melt
of precision and energy.
With the support of a very en
thusiastic audience, Murphy and his
eclectic ensemble burned through
the Latin sounds of "Chan Chan"
from the "Buena Vista Social Club"
soundtrack and a chanted African
water goddess prayer, backed by
percussionist Carolyn Brandy. The
audience shifted venues for the cul
minating dance and drumming set,
most folks staying till the end of the
set and leaving reluctandy.
Dena Deßose, a New York-based
pianist and jazz vocalist, returns to
the Stanford Jazz Festival for her
fifth year of participation as a per
former and a workshop leader. Al
though balancing her teaching re
sponsibilities with a featured perfor
mance at the North Beach Jazz Fes
tival in San Francisco, she is busy
preparing new vocal programs for
students newly interested in jazz
vocal styling.
"Teaching is the best way to
learn," says Deßose. "I love per
forming, it's my main thing — but
teaching is extraordinary because
you're giving and receiving at once,

watching others' growth, and un
derstanding the learning process."
Deßose, who has played the piano
since she was three years old, was
originally a classically trained musi
cian until she became interested in
jazz. "Since I come from a back
ground of reading notes, it took a
long time to understand music intu
itively, to remember everything
photograph ically."
After a brief foray with a touring
pop band, she tired of the limitations
of performing covers from pop al
bums. Seeking more creative lenien
cy in music, she progressed into jazz
studies and developed her ability to
sing and play simultaneously.
"Of course, doing it well involves
serious practice," Deßose said, "but
I started out very simply, just
singing on top of basic, beautiful
chords. It's very simple, but it gives
you an ear for more complex
sounds. If you can do the simple
stuff well, your ear will want to do
more, step by step. It's g(x>d to set a
difficult precedent for yourself, but
you have to start simple."
Deßose reflected that her musi
cal career is becoming more and
more rewarding as her work comes
to fruition. Having played gigs since
she was 13, she looks forward now to
working on new arrangements of
standard jazz repertoire and record
ing new albums. Despite all of these
endeavors, Deßose remains
strongest in performance. Her
piano accompaniment is increasing
ly complex and lyrical on its own,
but she manages to sing clearly and

scat on top of her piano work. So
what does she think about when
she's onstage?
"I'm not thinking much. When
I'm practicing, sure, I'm thinking of
diatonics and modal scales, but
when I get up there I just want to
make beautiful music."
"To feel sounds, shapes, colors;
that's what I do. If you're not think
ing so much, and just let yourself go,
your intuition and premeditated
ideas about certain sounds and
modes all sort of— kick in. And then
you develop a distinct musical per
sonality on top of that, as you figure
out how to what you need to, musi
cally."
Deßose kx)ks foi"ward to ventur
ing more energetically into compo
sition, a process which will start with
expanding her harmonic perspec
tive — by breaking from the rigid
symmetrical sounds of classical
music.
"It's a matter of listening more,
playing more, even listening to
modern classical work, like Samuel
Barber's. I hope to go to Cuba —
that place will really influence Amer
ican music."

Experience it while you can
Even though the Stanford Jazz Fes
tival is wrapping up its impressive
roster of events and educational of
ferings, the activity level remains
high throughout this week. The en
thusiasm of participants in the work
shops — as well as that of the concert
audiences — enhances the Festival
experience immeasurably.
The Stanford Jazz Festival is an
example of talented folk coalesc
ing upon their passion for good
tunes, technical expertise and the
hunger for improvement and new
sounds.
"We love what we do here," re
flects Jon Yanofsky, the Stanford
Jazz Festival's Managing Director.
"We recognize this festival's vital im
portance on cultural, social, artistic
and even psychological levels. It's
thrilling to work all year to produce
seven weeks of a highly charged cre
ative environment. We're all adren
aline junkies, creative energy
junkies. We get our fix not only
watching the senior artists perform,
but also watching young musicians
find their own musical voices."
The Jazz Festival culminates this
weekend with Harold Land on Fri
day night (Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
8 p.m.) and the music of Mulgrew
Miller on Saturday evening ((".amp
bell Recital Hall, 8 p.m.).
