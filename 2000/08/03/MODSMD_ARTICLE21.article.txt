## Stanford Jazz Festival showcases talent and energy 
### JENN LINDSAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Jazz Festival is
winding to a close this week with this
Saturday evening's Mulgrew Miller
concert. The Festival has enjoyed a
rich history on the Stanford campus,
combining the talents and energy of
participants from professional jazz
musicians to Bay Area kids just em
barking on their musical studies.
The Stanford Jazz Festival was
founded 28 years ago as an educa
tional venture by current festival di

rector Jim Nadel. It has since ex
panded, functioning as both a work
shop environment — offering jazz
theory courses and instrumental
master classes for both teenagers
and adults, and as a concert series—
featuring such ensembles as the
Chucho Valdez Quartet, the percus
sive styling of the Berkeley-based
Josh Jones Latin Trio and several in
dividual performances.
Looking inside the Festival
Many of the performing artists,

such as Bob Murphy — a local saxo
phonist and percussionist who re
turns to the Festival for his 28th
year, also contribute their efforts as
workshop facilitators.
His July 27 show, showcasing
"Bob Murphy and Friends," pre
sented a fusion of traditional, con
temporary and Latin jazz, culminat
ing in a wild dance circle to the
sounds of guest artist Batterie Tam
bour and an Afro-Cuban drum en
semble.
From the evening's start, Mur
phy's constantly-evolving ensemble

worked in tight rhythms and care
fully orchestrated transitions be
tween solos, with Murphy simulta
neously leading the band and wail
ing on his saxophone. Although his
opening set featured a mellow com
bination of vibes, upright bass and
Murphy's careening saxophone
solos, ensemble members and in
struments constantly rotated, ulti
mately introducing piano, guitar,
trombone, trumpet and legendaiy
jazz drummer Albert "Tootie"
Heath to achieve a funkolicious melt
of precision and energy.
With the support of a very en
thusiastic audience, Murphy and his
eclectic ensemble burned through
the Latin sounds of "Chan Chan"
from the "Buena Vista Social Club"
soundtrack and a chanted African
water goddess prayer, backed by
percussionist Carolyn Brandy. The
audience shifted venues for the cul
minating dance and drumming set,
most folks staying till the end of the
set and leaving reluctandy.
Dena Deßose, a New York-based
pianist and jazz vocalist, returns to
the Stanford Jazz Festival for her
fifth year of participation as a per
former and a workshop leader. Al
though balancing her teaching re
sponsibilities with a featured perfor
mance at the North Beach Jazz Fes
tival in San Francisco, she is busy
preparing new vocal programs for
students newly interested in jazz
vocal styling.
"Teaching is the best way to
learn," says Deßose. "I love per
forming, it's my main thing — but
teaching is extraordinary because
you're giving and receiving at once,

watching others' growth, and un
derstanding the learning process."
Deßose, who has played the piano
since she was three years old, was
originally a classically trained musi
cian until she became interested in
jazz. "Since I come from a back
ground of reading notes, it took a
long time to understand music intu
itively, to remember everything
photograph ically."
After a brief foray with a touring
pop band, she tired of the limitations
of performing covers from pop al
bums. Seeking more creative lenien
cy in music, she progressed into jazz
studies and developed her ability to
sing and play simultaneously.
"Of course, doing it well involves
serious practice," Deßose said, "but
I started out very simply, just
singing on top of basic, beautiful
chords. It's very simple, but it gives
you an ear for more complex
sounds. If you can do the simple
stuff well, your ear will want to do
more, step by step. It's g(x>d to set a
difficult precedent for yourself, but
you have to start simple."
Deßose reflected that her musi
cal career is becoming more and
more rewarding as her work comes
to fruition. Having played gigs since
she was 13, she looks forward now to
working on new arrangements of
standard jazz repertoire and record
ing new albums. Despite all of these
endeavors, Deßose remains
strongest in performance. Her
piano accompaniment is increasing
ly complex and lyrical on its own,
but she manages to sing clearly and
