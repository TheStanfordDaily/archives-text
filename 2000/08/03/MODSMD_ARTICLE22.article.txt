# 'Jesus' Son' is an inconsistent adaptation of book
## 
### GREG BRAZEAL EDITORIAL STAFF 
"Jesus' Son," adapted from Denis John
son's classic 1992 short story collection, is
something in between a drug movie without
many drugs and a love story distracted by
flashbacks.
Billy Crudup ("Without Limits") stars as
the movie's narrator and sensitive one-man
chemistry lab, known only as "Fuckhead."
The movie jumps back and forth between
Fuckhead's junkie wanderings and his at
tempts at recovery, first as a candy-striper in
an emergency room, later as the author of a
nursing home newsletter. During the latter
job he finds solace in spying on an Amish
family near the home, as if watching them
eat dinner will somehow teach him how to
live.
The best performances of the film come
from the impressive supporting cast, includ
ing Samantha Morton ("Sweet and Low
down") as Fuckhead's sometimes-girlfriend,

Will Patton as the man who takes her away
from Fuckhead, Holly Hunter as a woman
who frequents AA meetings for companion
ship and Dennis Hopper as a shaky old man
who has been shot "once by each wife, for a
total of three bullets, making four holes, three
ins and one out." Denis Leary delivers an es
pecially touching performance as a down
and-out alcoholic with a handlebar mustache
and as an ex-wile who hang-glides naked.
Several passages from the book translat
ed easily to the screen, especially one involv
ing a walk-in emergency room patient with a
knife through his eye. But for the most part,
this " Jesus' Son" is all Band-Aid and no cut,
a story about healing that never really shows
what caused the damage. Johnson's book
was something more like a cut made with a
Band-aid or healed with a knife: absurd, vi
olent, uplifting, always twitching out from
under any simple description.
Writer Elizabeth Cutrell and director Ali
son Maclean have made a strangely disjoint
ed movie about Fuckhead pulling his life to

gether and learning how to love. They have
included plenty of the bizarre, half-dreamed
twists and turns that make "Jesus' Son"
worth adapting into a movie. But they
haven't captured the tone or texture of a
world in which these twists and turns could
take place.
What remains is a more or less average
movie about recovery interrupted by occa
sional bursts of surrealism. Johnson's book
wove the two sides together in a seamless
fabric. I think this could have happened in
the film, as has happened before in Martin
Scorsese's "Bringing Out the Dead," which
unintentionally captured the feel of John
son's book, moved it to a city and erased all
traces of its wonderful dialogue and plot.
Crudup's narration exemplifies the
movie's inconsistency: he just sounds too up
beat and composed to have lived through
the stories he's showing us. Even the way the
movie jumps around doesn't quite catch the
book's disjointed poetry: what came across
in the book as a way of bringing order to

drug-addled memories sounds like little
more than Crudup's cheery, boyish caprice
in the film. Perhaps it was the simple inven
tiveness of not "acting like a junkie" that
brought Crudup the Best Actor award at the
Paris Film Festival.
Johnson took the title of his book from
the Velvet Underground's song "Heroin."
But there is very little of "Heroin" in Eliza
beth Cutrell's script or Maclean's direction.
Instead of that song's raw energy and sense
of borderline collapse, the atmosphere of
Maclean's film is closer to the Velvet Under
ground's sweet, downbeat ballad "Pale Blue
Fyes." For some viewers, this will probably
come as a welcome relief. For others, it is a
missed chance for a masterpiece.
