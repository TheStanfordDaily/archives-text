# Indigo Girls satisfy Greek Theater fans

Halfway through last Satur
day's Indigo Girls concert in
Berkeley, my friend turned to me
and said "Now I see why people
who go to their concerts really
come out liking Amy a lot."
The Girls, comprised of Emily
Saliers, Amy Ray and their back
ing band, played a rousing set that
indeed showcased Ray's stage
presence. As far as radio play
goes, the Indigo Girls' songs with
the most sticking power and top
-20 presence have tended to be
Saliers' sing-alongs and love
songs. Ray's edgier material is dis
turbing by contrast; it's mood
music — activist music.
But putting Ray into a show
context made all the difference.
She is a burst of energy, dancing
and jamming on her electric gui
tar with gusto and cheering on the
drummer at the same time. As she
pushes her hair out of her face
and draws in her breath for the
final chorus of a song, she looks
for all the world like a 20-year-old
female rocker high on her lirst
live show ever.
On songs such as "Ozilline"
and "Faye Tucker," Ray conveyed
the meanings of the songs in a
whole new way. "Go" was a galva
nizing call to action. The songs
were aided by the spirited perfor
mances of young cellist Matt
Brubeck and the instrument jug
gling of Carol Isaacs. Isaacs drew
cheers for her equally solid play
ing on keyboards, woodwinds and
accordion. The audience also re
sponded enthusiastically to the

Girls' new, gutsier lyrics about the
fight for gay rights.
Saliers' older songs, as übiqui
tous as they are by now, seemed to
be played because they were
obligatory. When the Girls real
ized that the whole audience was
singing along with "Closer to
Fine," they turned the micro
phones toward the audience for
the full last third of the song.
(Who could blame them? They've
been singing it forever.) Still,
Saliers' performance of "Ghost"
was gutsy, with a new, rougher
edge, and "Galileo" and "Get Out
the Map" were pure fun. Saliers in
general was less concerned with
making her voice sound as pure as
it does on recordings than with
having a good time, and the result
was a more real, earthy perfor
mance. This came in handy on the
restless "Trouble," with its more
sinister sound.
The Girls chose a great open
ing act in Spearhead. Watch out
for this band; it is sure to make a
mark in the coming years. The
name sounds like a punk band,
but it consists of a fusion of folk,
hip-hop, R+B and other styles
that result in good clean fun. The
lead singer was dynamic and larg
er than life, captivating the atten
tion of the whole audience (a rare
thing for an opening act). He
pranced around the stage while
the other bandleader, an African
woman with a gigantic voice, sang
along to his beats. They brought
the Indigo Girls out for a birthday
sing-along for Saliers, and the
easy, natural harmonies and joy
on-stage spoke for the communal
feel of the whole show.
