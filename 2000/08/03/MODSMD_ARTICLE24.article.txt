Stealthy music. Stealthy shad
ow slithering over the parapet.
The thickening downpour of
notes becomes a crescendo as the
Jets and Sharks mime in mock
politeness. A sudden breathless
pause, the music skips a beat and
the impeccably timed lunge of
Bernardo (Kato Bonner) sudden
ly dissipates any possible ambiva
lence toward the play on the au
dience's part.
Such was the icebreaker, or
more literally the ear-piercer, of
the Foothill Musical Theatre's
production of "West Side Story,"
that riveted the audience on its
opening night.
The plot is the remaking of
Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juli
et" — New York 1950s style. Two
street gangs are at war: the Puer
to Rican Sharks vs. the American
Jets.
Maria, Shark Bernardo's baby
sister, falls for Tony, a former Jet
gang member and best friend to
Riff, the leader of the Jets. Born
in the midst of a dance of rivalry,
the relationship is doomed from
the start but neither party will be
lieve it.
The original score of Leonard
Bernstein and Stephen Sond
heim along with the original di
rection and choreography of
Jerome Robbins were a musical
break-through at the time of the
musical's conception. The special
touch is the jagged and violently
beautiful sound which controls
and dictates an untraditional bal
let of movement: movement of
mood, passions, the quest for jus
tice and star-crossed love.
Director Jay Mauley's Foothill

Music Theatre production, star
ring C.J. Blankenship and Lane
McKenna as the young lovers,
dances through the sharp curves
and unexpected pauses of the
Bernstein and Sondheim score.
The solos are impressive.
Without relying on prop use to
sustain attention, the dynamic
voice of Blankenship, a 30-year
old Stanford graduate with a
bachelor's in computer science,
captures the possibilities in
"Something's Coming" and the
excitement in "Maria."
As Maria and Tony are reunit
ed on the balcony, the duet
"Tonight" can't be beat, emanat
ing such a privacy and culmina
tion of feeling that the audience
seems to be intruding in an inti
mate exchange of love vows.
The duet between Anita and
Maria in Act 2, scene 3 is likewise
stunning. "A Boy Like that / I
Have a Love" is a harmonious
blend of Maria's lyric soprano
with Anita's melodic alto. The
duet convincingly combines a
shrill warning and an empathic
sadness with sensitivity.
Although the syncopation of
movement between the respec
tive gang members, especially the
Jets, does leave room for im
provement, the choreography of
Bubba Gong is the manifestation
of the Bernstein score — quirky,
often sharply beautiful. Orderly
chaos rampages through the
fights, which are powerful yet ele
gant.
Sensing the music to the six
teenth of a beat, the beautifully
timed and skillfully performed
movements of Bernardo (Kato
Bonner) add magic to the work.
The dance skills of Margarita
(Rosa Isela Betancourt, also an

assistant choreographer), Juano
(Ryyn Chua), A-Rab (Alex
Naegele), Chino (Ted Zer
voulakos) and other members of
the cast are impressive.
Add to the dancing the con
vincing acting performances of
Riff (David Sattler), Action (Reno
Deßanieri) and the wildly ap
plauded "Gee, Officer Krupke"
number and the result is a power
ful performance of llux and sus
tained interest.
Mauley addresses all the an
gles of the artist ically challenging
script as orchestra conductor
Cathy Snyder and lighting direc
tor Kurt Landisman give them
sound and light.
Also enriching the two-and-a
half hour performance is the dar
ingly undeleted Act 2 "Dream
Ballet" sequence and joy Ragey's
set that evokes the colorful 1950s
and allows corrugated rusted
metal to give room to starry night
skies, a bridal shop, the gym and
whatever else is required.
Manley's "West Side Story" is
about setting the barre high and
pirouetting skillfully and patient
ly over the challenges. With a
Maria who has never danced be
fore, the musical is an amazing
five-week accomplishment on all
scores.
It is a medley of art forms inte
grating the best of each in a ballet
of circumstance, fate and all the
romance and poetry of a modern
ized Shakespearean tragedy.
