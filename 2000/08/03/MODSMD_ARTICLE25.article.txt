### VLADA TEPER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"The challenge was to take the
integrity of the work and make it
soar in my own special way," re
flected Bubba Gong regarding his
role as choreographer of the
Foothill Musical Theatre's new
production of "West Side Story."
"Dance is a really integral part of
moving the entire musical for
ward."
Urged by Director Jay Man ley to
pull out all stops and face any chal
lenge en fasse, Gong had a lot of
work to do. But it was not the first
time he had faced such a challenge.
After all, it was the Stanford
graduate with a bachelor's in eco
nomics and communication who
was monumental in building and
reinvigorating the Foothill College
dance program after being asked to

join Foothill in 1985.
Fifteen years, three (Mympiad of
the Arts College Dance Division
recognition awards and a thriving
Foothill College dance program
with a Repertory and Touring
Company later, the question still
remains: What is a good Chinese
boy from Clarksdale, Mississippi
with an economics degree still
doing next to a barre?
"When I was two years old 1 had
a pronated foot," admitted Gong.
"So my father had to either buy me
special shoes for the rest of my life
or enroll me in a dance class. He
went with the cheaper option."
Years later, Gong is still dancing
and choreographing more than
ever. Through involvement with
the Stanford Dance program dur
ing his undergraduate education.
Gong met and worked with Dance
professor J uan V alenzuela.

"It was Juan who encouraged
me to go for my dreams in Holly
wood instead of graduate school
after my undergraduate degree,"
said Gong.
Gong considers this some of the
best advice he took. His break
came when he was discovered by
Walt Disney Productions and made
"Kid of Kingdom." From there, his
career took oil. I asked him for an
example of his involvement with
Hollywood and Gong laughed say
ing, "What didn't I do?"
After his work with Walt Disney,
he got a chance to tour Europe and
worked with Boh Hope. He tasted
dance Hollywood style, participat
ing in national commercials for
Tropicana Orange Juice, Levi's
and Coca-Cola. He starred in the
soap opera "General Hospital."
In the revival of the Broadway
musical "Flower Drum Song," he

held the star role and then went on
to "The King and I " with Yul Br) li
ner, "Gypsy," "Barbary Goast," "A
Chorus Line," "Dancin" and oth
ers.
Susan Cashion, a senior lecturer
in the Stanlbrd Drama Depart
ment who is active in the Dance Di
vision, talked Gong into getting
reacquainted with the Stanford
campus and witli the weight of
heavy hooks, doming back to Palo
Alto and joining the Foothill The
atre as a tap dance instructor, (iong
decided to face a new challenge in
1992. He pirouetted toward a mas
ter's degree in dance education.
"It was a rigorous dance grad
program," said Gong. "It chal
lenged me to explore aspects of my
own dance perspective."
The added perspectives gave
new legitimacy to Gong's work and
provided the vital tools essential for

Gong as he faced an unprecedent
ed challenge — the choreography
of "West Side Story" with all the
complexity of its musical move
ments. "Out of the 200 who audi
tioned. 40 were selected with the
first cut based on the question 'Can
the person dance?'" said Gong.
After live weeks of grueling re
hearsals, highly choreographed
light scenes, the Dream Ballet se
quence in Act 11 that most directors
shy awa\ from and a set that is as or
ganic and lyrical as the music and
choreography, the musical is out
ruling the streets, and (iong is en
thusiastic.
"I had to eat, sleep and drink
music," said (iong. "A choreogra
pher can only do one "West Side
Story", and ... if you survive . ..
you pass it to the next generation of
choreographers . . ." laughed
Gong.
