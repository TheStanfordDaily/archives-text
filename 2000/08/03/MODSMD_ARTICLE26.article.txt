# Humanity clashes in 'Woolf'
## 
### GREG BRAZEAL EDITORIAL STAFF 
Looking at the popularity of
"teal world" television shows like
"The Real World" and "Survivor"
makes me think that bored, desen
sitized Americans should go see
more plays like the Actors Theatre
of San Francisco's current produc
tion of Edward Albee's "Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf?". This is
not a big, flashy production: the
bedroom-sized stage is upstairs
from a murder-mystery show at
533 Sutter St., and the theater can
only seat a few dozen. But what is
lost in flash and polish is more
than compensated in visceral inti
macy. This production of
"Woolf?" takes theater back to its
roots in ritual sacrifice.
The play follows two couples,
George and Martha and Honey
and Nick, through an alcohol
soaked late night and early morn
ing of psychological warfare, hu
miliation and infidelity. The
horsy, overflowing Martha is six
years older than the thin, graying
George and relentlessly hounds
him for failing to rise through the
ranks of the history department
where he works. She invites Nick,
a new faculty member, and his

young wife Honey for a nightcap
after a party. The atmosphere of
"Woolf?" is intensely academic,
but George and Martha use their
educations primarily to hurt each
other and mock the less clever
younger couple. The references
that George tosses around have
nothing to do with learning or in
telligence or Virginia Woolf —
they're simply weapons for show
ing who's in control.
The violence in the play is most
ly verbal but can be so perversely
cruel that when we finally see some
physical grappling near the end it
stands out less for its brutality than
for its odd humanity. Even when
George nearly smothers Martha,
at least they're making some kind
of contact. As Albee has said, the
play is at heart a love story. George
and Martha need each other to
survive.
Christian Phillips delivers an es
pecially memorable performance
as George, drawing out the latent
physical aggressiveness beneath
George's carefully maintained de
tachment. The size of the theater
gives all the actors room for a sub
tlety that would be lost on a larger
stage, and Phillips in particular
takes advantage.
By the play's third act, "The Ex

orcism," Catherine Castellanos
settles powerfully into the role of
Martha, accomplishing the diffi
cnlt task of making Martha human
rather than just a raw dynamo.
Paul D'Addario and Jennifer
Welch have a more difficult time
with Nick and Honey, if only be
cause Albee gives them less to work
with. Honey essentially has to sit
on a couch looking drunk and
naive for the majority of the play,
and Nick can sometimes devolve
into a caricature of empty young
ambition. In spite of this, D'Ad
dario and Welch pull off a few mo
ments of real pathos.
"Woolf?", which debuted in
1962 to controversy over its sup
posed obscenity and the use of
"tricks" from avant-garde theater
in a naturalistic play, has long
since been domesticated into an
indisputable masterpiece of post
war theater. An audience used to
"Fight Club"and "The Sixth
Sense" will hardly feel abused by
certain plot twists in "Woolf?". If
we are less likely to notice what was
shocking about the play in 1962,
we are also less likely to be distract
ed by it.
