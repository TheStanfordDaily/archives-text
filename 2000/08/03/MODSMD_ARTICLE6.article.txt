## Housing may replace historic first hole 
### DENNIS TYLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford continues to expand the physical nature of
the University, but this time some golfers think it may
have gone too far.
To increase housing for students and faculty, propos
als have been developed to wipe out the first hole of the
historic 70-year old golf course.
Larry Horton, Stanford's director of government and
community relations, maintains that the golf course is
one of the very few areas available for faculty, student
and staff housing.
"1 think we have put forward extremely reasonable
national land-use designations," said Horton. "We defi
nitely need the housing and there is an academic prior
ity. We are also strongly in favor of the athletic program
and want to preserve the golf course. Our proposal to
rebuild hole 1 at another location satisfies both needs."
Such a proposal has golfers and alumni — including
Tiger Woods — pledging to save the golf course.
One of the University's most notable opponents is
Richard Harris, a San Francisco attorney who captained
the Stanford golf team in the 60s and 70s.
"Anyone who knows anything about golf knows that
you don't remove the first hole of a golf course," Harris

told the San Jose Mercury News.
While opponents do not dispute that Stanford is ex
periencing a housing shortage, they do believe that the
University owns other areas where it could build.
Horton, however, says that there is simply no other
space available.
"The actual number of places where Stanford can
build housing are very few," said Horton.
Athletic Director Ted Leland agrees that there are
not many other alternatives besides building onto the
first hole.
"I thought that we had some compromises worked
out where we wouldn't lose that first fairway, but I think
we have to prepare for the worse case," Leland told the
San Jose Mercury News.
Although Stanford is comprised of 8,180 acres, he as
serts that a lot of the land cannot be built on.
Of the 8,180 acres, 4,017 are lands in unincorporated
Santa Clara Cnty., including the academic campus, the
golf course and the foothills. The foothills themselves
contain both the Foothill District and the largely unde
veloped Lathrop Development District, which Stanford
would like to adopt as part of the core campus.
The county may try to prevent Stanford from adding
development to its open spaces in the coming months
(see article below), but Horton maintains that this will

make it impossible for Stanford to
build sufficient housing without re
shaping the golf course.
How much housing is suffi
cient? Stanford proposes roughly
3,000 housing units over the next 10
years, but even this will only keep
pace with the University's proposed 2
million square feet of academic ex
pansion, leaving housing shortages
from the last decade of development
and housing complaints from service
personnel unaddressed.
Horton said that construction
on the golf course could provide 310
to 687 housing units, and confirmed
that the county is requiring Stanford
to develop the maximum 687 units.
This will mean that the first hole will
have to be destroyed.
When asked how the county
was able to tell Stanford how to use

The Santa Clara County Planning Commission
will hear public comments tonight on the draft envi
ronmental impact report (EIR) for Stanford's 10-year
development plan. Environmental groups such as
the Stanford Open Space Alliance are expected to
speak, as are a growing contingent of golfers frustrat
ed by the proposed replacement of the first hole on
the Stanford golf course with 157 housing units.
The hearing will be held at 6:30 a.m. in the Palo
Alto City Council Chambers, 250 Hamilton Avenue.
The public review period for the draft EIR ends
Aug. 7. Following recommendations from the public
and from Palo Alto and Menlo Park's city councils, the
county will prepare a final version of the EIR.
Then the debate will shift to Stanford's Communi
ty Plan, the special section of Santa Clara County's
general plan that governs the shape of Stanford de
velopment policy. Currently all of Stanford's lands
are technically designated as an agricultural zone, but
revisions to the Community Plan may change that.

KEITH ITO/The Stanford Daily
University officials propose to build housing over the first hole of the golf course.
their land Horton replied, "Since
we are trying to build new class
rooms and academic buildings,
the County will only allow us to
build those classrooms if we agree
to building more housing."
According to University offi
cials, the first hole could be
moved onto area B, which is a
part of the development agree
ment for Sand Hill Road. Al

though housing cannot be built
on that land until 2020, they
could build a new hole there.
Not open to the public except
for a few tournaments each year,
the course is used mostly by facul
ty, students and alumni. The
course covers approximately 175
acres of land on the east and west
sides of the Junipero Serra
Boulevard.
A planning hearing commis
sion is scheduled for Aug. 3 at the
City Council chambers in Palo
Alto to discuss this proposal fur
ther (see chart on page 3).
