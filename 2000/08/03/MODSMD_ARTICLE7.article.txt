# Palo Alto scrutinizes Stanford development plan
## 
### GREG BRAZEAL EDITORIAL STAFF 
The debate over Stanford's ground
breaking 10-year development plan took a
step forward Monday as the Palo Alto city
council finalized its recommendations for
changes to an environmental study of the
controversial proposal.
Santa Clara County's Board of Supervi
sors will have the final say over the Stanford
plan in late October, but before it delivers a

verdict it has invited comments from the
communities most affected by University ex
pansion.
Palo Alto Mayor Liz Kniss called Sum
ford's proposal "the most important county
land-use project in the coming decade."
"Stanford is proposing a new city of four
million square feet," council member Gary
Fazzino said.
While the council roundly agreed that
the county's environmental study was well
prepared, they recommended several

changes, many of them regarding open
space preservation.
"What we're looking for is an affirmative
analysis of the environmental benefits of
permanent open space protection," said
council member Judy Kleinberg, pointing
out that the study focuses primarily on the
negative results of development.
Once completed, the county's study,
known as the Environmental Impact Re
port (KIR), will be the primary resource in
deciding the limits of Stanford expansion.

It was paid for by Stanford but prepared
by a private consultant appointed by the
county.
Palo Alto has long demanded that Stan
ford expand its housing to help defuse the
area's housing crunch and reduce traffic but
wants the University to achieve these goals
through intensified development and in-fill
ing on the core campus, without sacrificing
open spaces.
Kniss also suggested expanding
public transportation like the Mar
guerite shuttle service as a partial
solution. "More use of that kind of
transportation around campus of
course would be desirable," she
said.
The city's staff report suggests
that the county should make open
space preservation a condition of
accepting Stanford's plan.
"The EIR does not discuss the in
evitable growth that will occur in the
foothills as the core campus ap
proaches build-out," the report
says. "Absolute assurance of conser
vation of the foothill open space
areas must be linked to the substan
tial amount of development being
proposed."
Stanford's personnel growth
over the last 10 years has far out
paced its housing expansion, and
council members applauded the
3,018 dwelling units included in the
plan. But they expressed a desire to
see the new housing built on Santa
Clara County's model of compact
urban development, without mov
ing outside Palo Alto's urban
growth boundary.
"Preserve that urban growth
boundary ," Kniss said. "There's no
question on that."
Sarah Cheney, the project man
ager for the EI R, said that she could

not identify areas entirely inside
Palo Alto's urban service area to put
the proposed housing. Kniss sug
gested that Stanford could intensify
development on underdeveloped
sites by constructing taller buildings
and more multi-level parking lots.
"We're at a moment of truth,"
said council member Nancy Lytle,
arguing that requiring Stanford to
develop housing will mean growth
onto open spaces.
Stanford has already come
under fire from Menlo Park, the
Mid peninsula Regional Open
Space district and environmental
groups such as the Stanford
Open Space Alliance for propos
ing 20,000 square feet of new
buildings west of Junipero Serra
Boulevard.
Golfing fans have raised an
outcry because the plan would re
place the first hole of the golf

course with housing (see accom
panying article).
The University's plan also redes
ignates a section of" the foothills
called the Lathrop Development
District from "Academic Reserve
and Open Space" to "Academic
Campus," which many interpret as
a first step toward building in the
foothills. Palo Alto's recommenda
tions suggest that land being main
tained as open space should be
identified as open space in the EIR
in the hopes that such land will
eventually be designated as "Open
Space" in the county's Community
Plan for Stanford land.
The Santa Clara County Plan
ning Commission will hear pub
lic comments on the draft version
of the EIR tonight at 6:30 p.m. in
the Palo Alto City Council cham
bers, 250 Hamilton (see chart on
page 3).
