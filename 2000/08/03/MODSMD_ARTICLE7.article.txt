# Palo Alto scrutinizes Stanford development plan

### GREG BRAZEAL EDITORIAL STAFF 
The debate over Stanford's ground
breaking 10-year development plan took a
step forward Monday as the Palo Alto city
council finalized its recommendations for
changes to an environmental study of the
controversial proposal.
Santa Clara County's Board of Supervi
sors will have the final say over the Stanford
plan in late October, but before it delivers a

verdict it has invited comments from the
communities most affected by University ex
pansion.
Palo Alto Mayor Liz Kniss called Sum
ford's proposal "the most important county
land-use project in the coming decade."
"Stanford is proposing a new city of four
million square feet," council member Gary
Fazzino said.
While the council roundly agreed that
the county's environmental study was well
prepared, they recommended several

changes, many of them regarding open
space preservation.
"What we're looking for is an affirmative
analysis of the environmental benefits of
permanent open space protection," said
council member Judy Kleinberg, pointing
out that the study focuses primarily on the
negative results of development.
Once completed, the county's study,
known as the Environmental Impact Re
port (KIR), will be the primary resource in
deciding the limits of Stanford expansion.

It was paid for by Stanford but prepared
by a private consultant appointed by the
county.
Palo Alto has long demanded that Stan
ford expand its housing to help defuse the
area's housing crunch and reduce traffic but
wants the University to achieve these goals
through intensified development and in-fill
ing on the core campus, without sacrificing
open spaces.
