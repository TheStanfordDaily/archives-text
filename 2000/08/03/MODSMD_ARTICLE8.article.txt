### YVETTE ARTIGA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Most of the nurses who participated in a 51 -day strike
against Stanford and Packard hospitals returned to work yes
terday, the first wave arriving at 7 a.m.
Union nurses at Stanford Hospital and Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital ended their eight-week strike last Thurs
day, narrowly approving a contract that gives them a greater
ability to address patients' needs, but a smaller salary increase
than originally sought.
"The strike reflected the nationwide uprising of people in
the medical profession, with similar disputes occurring across
the nation and more to come," said Kim Griffin, a spokesper
son for the Committee for Recognition of Nursing Achieve
ment (CRONA).
The nurses ratified a new contract by just 15 votes on July
27. They applauded the end to mandatory overtime and
were happy about additional benefits, but they only grudg
ingly accepted a pay raise that includes a 10 percent pay in
crease over two years and an additional 1 percent each year
to nurses with 15 years of experience or more.
Under union guidelines, a simple majority of the nurses
had to approve the contract for it to be ratified. The final tally
of votes cast was 825 in favor and 810 opposed. Included in
the opposition counts were 259 nurses who did not vote and
were counted as "no votes." Not counted, however, were the
approximately 60 to 100 nurses who returned to work dur
ing the strike.
Highlights of the proposal include an agreement by hos
pital management to seek volunteers to cover nurses who are
unable to work overtime and an attempt by management to
grant two consecutive weeks of vacation per year without re
quiring the nurse to find someone to cover for him or her.

Nurses who are too tired or sick to perform safely will now
have the option of asking to be relieved of duty. Additionally,
nurses can ask for a hospital review of staffing levels or take
staffing disputes to a federal mediator.
The strike began on June 7 with 1,730 nurses from the
Stanford and Packard hospitals demanding a 20 percent raise
over two years as well as changes to policies that allegedly en
dangered patient care.
The nurses marched and picketed in efforts to increase
public awareness of their concerns and demands, carrying
signs that read "Stanford-Packard Nurses on Strike" and"I
want to be a nurse, can I afford to?"
They were disappointed with the 10 percent, two-year pay
increase in part because the nurses' union had voluntarily
taken low pay increases in their past two contracts.
"Our nurses wanted cost of living increases plus a raise,"
said Griffin.
Negotiating teams for the union and management have
been meeting since last Friday to work out details of the tran
sition back to work, which includes the dismissal of roughly
500 replacement nurses who were hired at an expense of
$4,000 to $5,000 a week, including housing at hotels and
Stanford dormitories.
The average CRONA nurse is paid $ 1,070 a week, $55,540
a year.
"The fact that hospitals spent a lot of money on replace
ment workers demonstrates the direction of America's health
care. Insuring the maintenance of bureaucracy is valued
more than patient care," said Griffin.
Of the 1,730 nurses who initially walked out, between 60
and 100 workers returned to work before the end of the
strike. According to Griffin they will face union fines, but an
amount has yet to be determined.
An additional 20 to 50 nurses have taken permanent jobs

elsewhere, creating scheduling problems for the hospitals
during the transition from the strike. According to hospital
spokesman Matt Lash, "We will do everything we can to
make it a smooth transition."
On Monday, CRONA received four resignations and ex
pects the toll to climb in the next two weeks. Lash said the hos
pitals plan to hire additional nurses from the registry services
as well as undertake "aggressive recruitment" of new nurses
to till the scheduling gaps.
Both sides expressed relief that one of the longest nursing
strikes in the Bay Area, and the first for the union since 1974,
is finally over.
"We are pleased that the nurses are back and we will con
tinue to focus on providing quality care to our patients," said
Lash.
