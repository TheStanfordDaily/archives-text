# Stanford profs and students come out in support of Napster
## 
### BILL FALSEY 
After the dust cleared on last week's flur
ry of legal activity, San Mateo's Napster, the
world's largest facilitator of digital music ex
changes, found itself more or less back
where it has been since last December: in the
eye of a legal hurricane and with an uncer
tain future.
A&M Records v. Napster, brought by the
Recording. Industry Association of America
(RIAA) against Napster in December, is one
of the industry's first major legal efforts
aimed at bringing an end to what it perceives
as illegal online distribution of copyrighted
songs. The case is being heard by U.S. Dis
trict Judge Marylin Matel in San Francisco.
At least two Stanford faculty members
have submitted expert reports to Patel in
support of Napster. Their papers can be
found on Napster's Web site (www.nap
ster.com) along with the submissions of Pub
lic Enemy's Chuck D and other such nota
bles as DJ Xealot.
Stanford Law School Prof. Lawrence
Lessig warned the court not to ban a tech
nology on the basis of its initial application
"even if significant violations of copyright

were enabled."
Lessig saw the Napster injunction as tan
tamount to a ban.
He continues, "If that had been the test,
then many of the Internet's early technolo
gies would have been banned. Likewise
would the VCR have been banned and pos
sibly even the Xerox machine."
Robert E. Hall, a professor of economics
and Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution,
was enlisted by Napster to analyze the eco
nomic issues underlying the case. He argued
that an injunction levied on Napster would
not prevent the RIAA from losing profits.
His statement concludes by saying that
"exchanges of music facilitated by Napster
stimulate demand for [CDs] by allowing con
sumers to sample CDs and develop interest
in CDs that they subsequently pur
chase .. . exchanges facilitated by Napster
stimulate the building of the infrastructure
necessary for the [RlAA]'s entry into the dig
ital download market... and the creation of
myriad facilities besides Napster for con
sumers to obtain free MPS files [would] re
place Napster if Napster were shut down."
The RIAA's legal team has dismissed
studies showing that CD sales were rising

even as Napster gained in popularity as
"weak" and "irrelevant." They argue that
Napster's true impact is shown in evidence of
a decline in CD sales near college campuses,
one of Napster's largest demographics.
Hall criticizes those conclusions, noting
that while stores near college campuses may
be losing sales, those CD sales are still occur
ring through online brokers such as
CDNow.com or BarnesandNoble.com. Cit
ing other studies, he concludes that the net
effect of Napster and other programs on the
profits of the RIAA's companies is "either
zero or positive."
"Napster has allowed me the opportunity
to discover several new musical groups
which I otherwise would not have developed
an interest in," junior Marin McDonald said.
"I have purchased several new CDs from
various artists due to the exposure Napster
gave them."
Sophomore Paul Molodowitch took a
more skeptical view. "I'd be lying if I didn't
claim for pretty selfish reasons to be disap
pointed in the prospect of Napster shutting
down, but I have to admit I think it's proba
bly the right legal course and in the best in
terest of the bands," he said. "I know that

there are people who really do use Napster
in the ideological, fairy-tale manner that the
Napster lawyers would have you believe, but
I think the truth is probably that they are far
outnumbered by the people who find that
the temptation of not having to shell out any
money outweighs any moral compunctions
they may have."
in any case, Hall also observes that with a
variety of other programs available, such as
Scour Exchange, iMesh, CuteMX, Gnutella,
and Freenet, MP3 users are unlikely to be se
riously hindered by Napster's termination.
Stanford students like junior english
major J. R. Eppler and junior physics major
Dan Flickinger agree, pointing to their use
of Scour and Gigabeat, a more recent start
up lead by Stanford alumni.
Junior Joseph Smarr recently found him
self banned from Napster after he was
named by Metallica's laywers, along with
350,000 others, as having downloaded copy
righted Metallica songs. Smarr said, "I had
already been playing around with Gnutella,
but being banned from Napster provided a
real motivation to invest more time in it. And
actually, I've decided that Gnutella is a better
program anyway."
