## DAILY VIEWPOINT Racing to pick sunflowers by the side of the road 
### MEREDITH ROWE STAFF COLUMNIST 
The very first thing you see when driving
through the little city about 45 minutes
north of Dallas is a tall white steeple, rising
toward the clouds above the largest church
for miles around.
If you stop to explore a bit more, you'll
find the 14-screen movie theater (one of the
city's greatest retail accomplishments in
years), Towne Lake (because every "towne"
needs one) and the little old Victorian house
where, local legend has it, the movie "Benji"
was filmed.
This is McKinney, Texas, home of the
Southern, the proud and the Baptist. The na
tion's "crape myrtle tree" capital. Neighbor to
the even smaller cities of Anna, Sherman,
Melissa, Celina and Allen (as my 12-year-old
cousin—an out-of-towner — put it, "Are you
sure those are the names of cities?"). Head
quarters of the McKinney Courier-Gazette,
the newspaper that couldn't decide on just
one name. Where "Y'all come back soon" is a
proverb and high school football is king.
This is my home, and it has been since I
was a seventh grader.
It has always been a charming place to live,
but since I've gone to "liberal Stanford" (as
some people around here have called it) and
gotten all citified, summer vacations have
been getting progressively less exciting.
Let's face it, there are onlv so many times

cow tipping can actually provide that much of
a thrill.
So, lest you ever decide to visit my
hometown or any of the other zillion tiny
cities around the country — because
they're all the same, deep down — I've put
together a little list of things to do. Mind
you, this is not a list of things to see — such
landmarks don't abound here in suburbia,
unless you're particularly fond of rows of
under-irrigated corn . . .
1.) In downtown McKinney, in between
Clyde's Ice Cream and an antique shop,
there's a rather large restaurant known as
"The Pantry." If McKinney has any institu
tions, well then, this is it. Open only for lunch
Monday through Saturday, this line estab
lishment serves the best iced tea and home
made chocolate chip pie you'll find this side of
the Mississippi. Frequent customers are
ladies 40 and older — this is the place where
the socialites are seen; if you're anyone who's
anyone, you swear by the wholesomeness of
Pantry food.
The best part about the restaurant — and
get ready, because this is where the fun comes
in — is that the hostesses take your name
along with your order and bellow it across the
building when your meal's ready (a strong,
Texas-sized set of lungs are a prerequisite for
employment here, you see). So, what the kids
do is give those poor women a hard time and
report fake names: Gilligan, Sassafrass and
Honey Pumpkin are among the oft-chosen

monikers. Imagine doing this at Jamba Juice,
only in a setting with about 300 more people,
most of them study, cranky and right set in
their ways, and you've got a recipe for good
times.
2.) They say New York City is overrun by
rats. Well, in much the same way, McKinney
is home to an ever-spreading, hearty beast
of its own: long-stemmed sunflowers. They
grow literally everywhere, from random
fields to any patch of dirt that lays un
touched for more than four minutes to
cracks in the pavement of the Wal-mart
parking lot. It's kind of like a plague. The
fun activity actually involving these weeds is
to go picking them late at night. Pull over to
the side of the road, grab your scissors or
your best teeth, and have at it. Pretend
someone actually cares. Make it fast; race
your friends to see who can return with an
already-wilting bouquet of sticky yellow
flowers in the shortest passage of time.
3.) Watch the Republican Convention.
Okay, so this is applicable only every four
years and has already been all used up for this
summer. It still rates a number three on my
list. This activity is especially enjoyable ifdone
in the company of a middle-aged or older
adult. They nod encouragingly at George W.
Bush on the television, murmuring "that's
right" softly every tew seconds and occasion
ally bursting into solo standing ovations.
And everyone over 40 has a story about
the great governor; heck, even my own

mother baby-sat his little sister as a child.
They'll sit back in their armchairs, eyes glazed
over and reminisce about days when the
Bushes lived next door, when gas was cheap
and when every lake was named "Towne."
4.) Sometimes students take a language
class during the summer, hoping to broaden
their horizons or earn a lew extra units. Well,
in McKinney, you can pick up a new accent
during the summer.
Texas is neither the South nor the West
nor the Southeast, so most people around
here seem to he pretty contused as to which
accent should be rightfully theirs. There is
thus a wide range of speaking dialects, from
my currently llat "Umnim ... maybe you're
from Michigan or something?" non-accent to
the truly disturbing twang in which "sin" is a
three-syllable word.
In order to add a little flavor to your voice,
get yourself a job at any small McKinney
venue and listen up. After doing so myself
this July, I've started saying the word "right"
with an extra two syllables, completely by ac
cident. It's an endearing trait, sure to impress
future California friends and employers.
These activities should be enough to keep
you occupied for awhile. Enjoy, y'all.

Clyde's Ice Cream and an antique shop,
there's a rather large restaurant known as
"The Pantry." If McKinney has any institu
tions, well then, this is it. Open only for lunch
Monday through Saturday, this line estab
lishment serves the best iced tea and home
made chocolate chip pie you'll find this side of
the Mississippi. Frequent customers are
ladies 40 and older — this is the place where
the socialites are seen; if you're anyone who's
anyone, you swear by the wholesomeness of
Pantry food.
The best part about the restaurant — and
get ready, because this is where the fun comes
in — is that the hostesses take your name
along with your order and bellow it across the
building when your meal's ready (a strong,
Texas-sized set of lungs are a prerequisite for
employment here, you see). So, what the kids
do is give those poor women a hard time and
report fake names: Gilligan, Sassafrass and
Honey Pumpkin are among the oft-chosen

monikers. Imagine doing this at Jamba Juice,
only in a setting with about 300 more people,
most of them study, cranky and right set in
their ways, and you've got a recipe for good
times.
2.) They say New York City is overrun by
rats. Well, in much the same way, McKinney
is home to an ever-spreading, hearty beast
of its own: long-stemmed sunflowers. They
grow literally everywhere, from random
fields to any patch of dirt that lays un
touched for more than four minutes to
cracks in the pavement of the Wal-mart
parking lot. It's kind of like a plague. The
fun activity actually involving these weeds is
to go picking them late at night. Pull over to
the side of the road, grab your scissors or
your best teeth, and have at it. Pretend
someone actually cares. Make it fast; race
your friends to see who can return with an
already-wilting bouquet of sticky yellow
flowers in the shortest passage of time.
3.) Watch the Republican Convention.
Okay, so this is applicable only every four
years and has already been all used up for this
summer. It still rates a number three on my
list. This activity is especially enjoyable ifdone
in the company of a middle-aged or older
adult. They nod encouragingly at George W.
Bush on the television, murmuring "that's
right" softly every tew seconds and occasion
ally bursting into solo standing ovations.
And everyone over 40 has a story about
the great governor; heck, even my own

mother baby-sat his little sister as a child.
They'll sit back in their armchairs, eyes glazed
over and reminisce about days when the
Bushes lived next door, when gas was cheap
and when every lake was named "Towne."
4.) Sometimes students take a language
class during the summer, hoping to broaden
their horizons or earn a lew extra units. Well,
in McKinney, you can pick up a new accent
during the summer.
Texas is neither the South nor the West
nor the Southeast, so most people around
here seem to he pretty contused as to which
accent should be rightfully theirs. There is
thus a wide range of speaking dialects, from
my currently llat "Umnim ... maybe you're
from Michigan or something?" non-accent to
the truly disturbing twang in which "sin" is a
three-syllable word.
In order to add a little flavor to your voice,
get yourself a job at any small McKinney
venue and listen up. After doing so myself
this July, I've started saying the word "right"
with an extra two syllables, completely by ac
cident. It's an endearing trait, sure to impress
future California friends and employers.
These activities should be enough to keep
you occupied for awhile. Enjoy, y'all.
