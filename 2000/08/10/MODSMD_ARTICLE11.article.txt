# DAILY VIEWPOINT
## A 						'Black or White' issue 
### ALICE BROWN STAFF COLUMNIST 
So last night I decided that the answer to
the question: "What's a good thing to do on
Tuesday night when you have to get up for
work at 7:30 a.m.?" was "Co out and get
home at 3 a.m. and then talk on the phone
till 4 a.m. and then search the house from
top to bottom for Fritos and fall asleep only
after you've concluded that you ate them all
the last time you were up at this hour."
Therefore, I'm struggling a bit as I write
this. But I would like to vent about a com
ment I overheard last night and work
through all the churning emotions it
evoked.
The I)J at the club I went to and I were
pretty much leeched by the end of the
night. I quickly vetoed his proposed play
list ("The Thong Song" and "Brown-Eyed
Girl," alternating) and batted my eyelashes
until he finally admitted that, yes, he did
have the song "Oops, I Did it Again." It
took even more effort for him to dig up
"Bye Bye Bye," but in the end my begging
was worth it.(I mean, how good is that

song?)
Anyway, toward the end of the night,
Chris (duh — the DJ — we're on a first
name basis) came through in a major way
and played a Michael Jackson song. (For
those of you familiar with his work, the par
ticular song was "Wanna he Startin* Some
thing," one of the greatest songs EVER.) 1
was the happiest person in America when I
heard that song play. 1 hurtled myself on to
the dance floor and was giddily making a
complete fool of myself when I heard some
one say something that completely ruined
the moment: "Michael Jackson sucks."
I would feel similarly if someone told me
that Diet Coke sucked — shocked, hurt
and outraged. Let's be honest: Michael
Jackson is amazing. The first tape I ever
bought with my own money was Bad.
Shortly after buying it my aunt and uncle
came to visit. I walked into my room one af
ternoon to find my three-year-old cousin
gleefully pulling out all the tape; my TV
viewing privileges were revoked for an en
tire week after the grown-ups saw the welt
on his head that I caused when I smacked
him.

Of course, Bad was not my first exposure
to Michael. Thriller was the only good tape
my mom kept in the car, so after years of lis
tening to ii on the way to school I could pro
claim with authority: Billie Jean is NOT my
lover.
One of the greatest Christmas presents I
ever got was a singular sequined glove — 1
wore it to school every day until the sequins
fell off. (And before you start snickering

about what a tool I was, know that I started
a trend. This one girl wore one red mitten
every day. I mean, was she serious? How
lame is that?)
You know Michael's song "Annie are
you okay, are you okay Annie?" 1 used to be
really jealous of anyone named Annie, be
cause, if M-dog ever sang the words "Alice

are you okay?" I would not be
okay because I'd die of happiness.
"The girl is mine," "P.Y.T.,"
"The way you make me feel," —
classics. And don't even get me
started on "Man in the Mirror." I

literally want to marry that song.
All the kids in my freshman dorm
would occasionally say things like,
"If you play that song one more
time, I will throw a mirror at you,"
but I know they really loved it.
How could you not be inspired by
such lyrics as "If you wanna make
the world, a beh-tah place take a
look at yourself and make that
change — booh! Hoooh!"
Okay, so maybe Mikie had a

few "issues" in the child-molesta
tion arena. So he slept in a bubble
and had pet monkeys. Hey — who
doesn't have eccentricities? Don't
be jealous just because YOU don't
have the money to reshape your
face from a nice young man to a
pasty, scary looking woman whose
nose looks like it could fall off and
who has permanently red lips and
tattooed eye-liner.
And yeah, maybe he wears oxy

gen masks and his pants are too
short and he grabs his crotch a lot
and is besties with Macauly Culkin
— no one's perfect. (And you have
to admit — Macauly was cute in
his "Home Alone" days.)
I remain a staunch supporter
and huge fan. I have read two
unauthorized biographies of him
and feel justified by these fine
works of nonfiction in saying that
here is a gifted musician whose

voice is so high it frightens and
worries me. WAI T, I mean he's a
gifted musician who is clearly in
need of serious professional help.
He is a GIFTED musician who is
an incredible dancer and "a lover,
not a fighter." There.
So, to that dumb girl in the club
Tuesday night who would dare to
listen to a song that includes the
line "Mamma say mamma sa
mamma ma-cou-sa" and assert
that the talented author of those
words "sucks,"
JUST BEAT IT.
