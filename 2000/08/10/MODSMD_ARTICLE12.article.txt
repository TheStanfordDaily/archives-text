## Splashing into Indy 
### KIMBERLY DOWNS TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Strap on your goggles and slide into your
super-hi-tech-almost-banned-full-body suits,
swim fans: it's time for the ode to the aquatic
world known as the Olympic Trials, which
started yesterday and continue until Aug. 18.
And, in what has become quite a familiar trend,
a tleet of current and former Stanford swim
mers are contending for the few spots available
on the Olympic Team, which will head to Syd
ney in September along with about 1,300 other
swimming hopefuls.
In all, 16 swimmers representing the Car
dinal and White are in Indianapolis, ranging
in age from elder stateswoman Jenny Thomp
son at 28 to young pup John Waters, who will
be but a sophomore next school year. As in
1996, die coach of the women's Olympic Team
will be Richard Quick, who is also the head
coach of women's swimming on the Farm.
More than a few Stanford swimmers are ex
pected to be favorites — here is a list of who to
l(X)k for, with the swimmer followed by their
events.
Jenny Thompson, class of 1995: 100-meter
butterfly, 200-meter freestyle, 100-meter
freestyle and 50-meter freestyle.
Thompson heads into Indy looking to
make up for her poor performance at the 1996
Trials, where she failed to make the team in
any individual event. She did, however, grab
three golds in relay races to add to her pair
from Barcelona in 1992, tying Bonnie Blair's
record for an American woman.

Thompson earned the 1999 U.S. Olympic
Committee's Sports Woman of the Year award
after breaking Mary T. Meagher's 18-year-old
world record in the 100 fly at the 1999 Pan Pa
cific (championships (her American record was
broken by Dara Torres yesterday). She is the
defending world champion, but with Inge de
Bruijn of the Netherlands breaking her world
record in May, she will have a big incentive to
swim fast at the trials.
Thompson is the defending world champi
on and the American record holder in die 100
free, where she earned a silver medal at the
1992 Olympics but did not qualify to compete
in the 100 meter free in 1996. At 27, she swam
her fastest 100 meter freestyle at the 1999
Summer Nationals since her 1992 world
record swim.
Misty Hyman, senior: 100-meter butterfly,
200-meter butterfly and 200-meter back
stroke.
Hyman revolutionized butterfly events
with her underwater dolphin kick, but then in
1998 FIN A ended the revolution with a 15-
meter underwater limit. Hyman has adjusted
with a sub-59 in the 100 in 1999, but her top
performances in that event occurred in 1997.
As for the 200, she has won live of six U.S. na
tional titles, but has been stuck on the number
three internationally. She finished third in the
200-meter fly at the 1997 Short Course
Worlds, 1997 Pan Pacific's, 1998 World Cham
pionships and 1999 Pan Pacifics.
Thomas Wilkens, class of 1998: 400-meter
individual medlev, 200-meter breaststroke

and 200-meter individual medley.
Wilkens has quietly became one of Ameri
ca's most dominant swimmers. He finished
1998 ranked number one in the world in the
200-meter breast and won the 200-meter IM
at the 1999 Pan Pacifics. Wilkens was on world
record pace well into both IMs at the 2000
Spring Nationals, where he handed Tom
Dolan, the world-record holder, a rare defeat.
At the 2000 Spring Nationals, Wilkens de
cided to concentrate on the IMs and turned in
two stellar winning efforts, but don't forget
about his prowess in the breaststroke. His win
in the 200 meter individual medley was the
pivotal event at the 1999 Pan Pacifics, where he

showed a lot of guts, according to the coaches.
He also was courageous at the 2000 Spring Na
tionals, fighting off' hard-charging veterans
like Tom Dolan and Ron Karnaugh.
Kurt Grote, class of 1995:100-meter breast
stroke and 200-meter breaststroke.
Grote won the Pan Pacific title in the 100-
meter breast.stroke in 1997 and went on to
earn a bronze medal at the 1998 World C 'hani
pionships, but he has had medical problems
ever since.

at the 1999 Pan Pacifics. Wilkens was on world
record pace well into both IMs at the 2000
Spring Nationals, where he handed Tom
Dolan, the world-record holder, a rare defeat.
At the 2000 Spring Nationals, Wilkens de
cided to concentrate on the IMs and turned in
two stellar winning efforts, but don't forget
about his prowess in the breaststroke. His win
in the 200 meter individual medley was the
pivotal event at the 1999 Pan Pacifics, where he

showed a lot of guts, according to the coaches.
He also was courageous at the 2000 Spring Na
tionals, fighting off' hard-charging veterans
like Tom Dolan and Ron Karnaugh.
Kurt Grote, class of 1995:100-meter breast
stroke and 200-meter breaststroke.
Grote won the Pan Pacific title in the 100-
meter breast.stroke in 1997 and went on to
earn a bronze medal at the 1998 World C 'hani
pionships, but he has had medical problems
ever since.

Strap on your goggles and slide into your
super-hi-tech-almost-banned-full-body suits,
swim fans: it's time for the ode to the aquatic
world known as the Olympic Trials, which
started yesterday and continue until Aug. 18.
And, in what has become quite a familiar trend,
a tleet of current and former Stanford swim
mers are contending for the few spots available
on the Olympic Team, which will head to Syd
ney in September along with about 1,300 other
swimming hopefuls.
In all, 16 swimmers representing the Car
dinal and White are in Indianapolis, ranging
in age from elder stateswoman Jenny Thomp
son at 28 to young pup John Waters, who will
be but a sophomore next school year. As in
1996, die coach of the women's Olympic Team
will be Richard Quick, who is also the head
coach of women's swimming on the Farm.
More than a few Stanford swimmers are ex
pected to be favorites — here is a list of who to
l(X)k for, with the swimmer followed by their
events.
Jenny Thompson, class of 1995: 100-meter
butterfly, 200-meter freestyle, 100-meter
freestyle and 50-meter freestyle.
Thompson heads into Indy looking to
make up for her poor performance at the 1996
Trials, where she failed to make the team in
any individual event. She did, however, grab
three golds in relay races to add to her pair
from Barcelona in 1992, tying Bonnie Blair's
record for an American woman.

Thompson earned the 1999 U.S. Olympic
Committee's Sports Woman of the Year award
after breaking Mary T. Meagher's 18-year-old
world record in the 100 fly at the 1999 Pan Pa
cific (championships (her American record was
broken by Dara Torres yesterday). She is the
defending world champion, but with Inge de
Bruijn of the Netherlands breaking her world
record in May, she will have a big incentive to
swim fast at the trials.
Thompson is the defending world champi
on and the American record holder in die 100
free, where she earned a silver medal at the
1992 Olympics but did not qualify to compete
in the 100 meter free in 1996. At 27, she swam
her fastest 100 meter freestyle at the 1999
Summer Nationals since her 1992 world
record swim.
Misty Hyman, senior: 100-meter butterfly,
200-meter butterfly and 200-meter back
stroke.
Hyman revolutionized butterfly events
with her underwater dolphin kick, but then in
1998 FIN A ended the revolution with a 15-
meter underwater limit. Hyman has adjusted
with a sub-59 in the 100 in 1999, but her top
performances in that event occurred in 1997.
As for the 200, she has won live of six U.S. na
tional titles, but has been stuck on the number
three internationally. She finished third in the
200-meter fly at the 1997 Short Course
Worlds, 1997 Pan Pacific's, 1998 World Cham
pionships and 1999 Pan Pacifics.
Thomas Wilkens, class of 1998: 400-meter
individual medlev, 200-meter breaststroke

and 200-meter individual medley.
Wilkens has quietly became one of Ameri
ca's most dominant swimmers. He finished
1998 ranked number one in the world in the
200-meter breast and won the 200-meter IM
at the 1999 Pan Pacifics. Wilkens was on world
record pace well into both IMs at the 2000
Spring Nationals, where he handed Tom
Dolan, the world-record holder, a rare defeat.
At the 2000 Spring Nationals, Wilkens de
cided to concentrate on the IMs and turned in
two stellar winning efforts, but don't forget
about his prowess in the breaststroke. His win

meter breast.stroke in 1997 and went on to
earn a bronze medal at the 1998 World C 'hani
pionships, but he has had medical problems
