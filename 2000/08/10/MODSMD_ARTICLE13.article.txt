# Sager says goodbye to Stanford

### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Pitcher Brian Sager's last outing of the year for the
Stanford baseball team was something he'd probably
rather forget —1 and 1/3 innings, three hits and five
earned runs surrendered to Lousiana-Lafayette during
the College World Series.
Now, it appears, he'd like to forget the rest of his Stan
ford career.
According to Stanford's Department of Athletics,
Sager, a hard-throwing right-hander, asked for and was
given a release from his scholarship for his remaining
two years of collegiate eligibility. Sager's decision gives
him the ability to transfer to the school of his choice im
mediately. Baseball America reports that Sager's list of
prospective schools includes North Carolina, Duke, Tu
lane and Rice.
Leaving to further his career at another school for
only one year does not make much sense — in terms of
development, it probably does not get much better than
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess and his staff, who
have helped hurlers like Mike Mussina, Rick Helling
and Jack McDowell to major league success in the past.
Also, the Pacific 10 Conference is arguably the toughest
in the country, so whatever competition Sager faces
would be a step down from what he got at Stanford.
Sager came to Stanford after turning down a $ 1 mil

lion signing bonus from the Arizona Diamondbacks,
who selected him in the 13th round of the 1998 amateur
draft following his high sch(x>l career in Connecticut.
Baseball America had named him the fourth best high
school player in the country in 1998 and the ninth best
player in the entire draft.
In his two years at the Farm, Sager demonstrated sig
nificant ability at times, although he suffered from in
consistency. He stepped in as the team's third starter as
a freshman and helped the team into the College World
Series, finishing the year 6-0 with a 4.17 earned run av
erage.
The 2000 season wasn't as kind to Sager. He began
the season as the third starter behind Jason Young and
Justin Wayne but never really got into a groove. After a
game at Southern California in March, he was diag
nosed with a shoulder injury that t<x>k him out of action
for nearly a month.
Sager returned toward the end of the regular season
and after a couple of shaky outings turned in dominat
ing performances against Alabama and Nebraska in Re
gional and Super Regional play, respectively, at Sunken
Diamond. His win in the Nebraska game, where he
pitched seven innings and gave up one earned run, put
the Cardinal into the College World Series.
In his final season at Stanford, Sager went (>1 with a
rather high 5.18 KRA in 14 appearances, with a total of
57 1/3 innings pitched.

Brian Sager has thrown his last pitch for the Cardinal, but where he'll throw
next year is still up in the air.
