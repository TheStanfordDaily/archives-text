### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Pacific 10 CConference looks to Ix.-
on its way to approving postseason bas
ketball tournaments for men and
women, beginning with the 2002 season.
()n Aug. 2, eight of the conference's
10 athletic directors voted in favor of
creating a men's tournament to be
held in Los Angeles at the Staples (Cen
ter, with Stanford and Arizona being
the lone holdouts. Eight votes from the
athletic directors are necessary to rec
ommend a vote to the Pac- lOC Council,
which is made up of one representa
tive from each of the 10 schools. The
Council will meet on Oct. 3 to approve
the proposed tournament which
seems highly likely at this point.
"Every conference I've been in
volved in has had a postseason tourna
ment," California Athletics Director
John Kasser told the (Contra (Costa
Times. "It is great exposure for both
the fans and the conference. It is a
showcase, a slice of basketball heaven."
The Pac-10 and the Ivy League are
currently the only Division I basketball
conferences without a postseason
tournament. There was a Pac-10 tour
ney from 1987 to 1990, but it was
stopped due to concerns over missed
class time and also a-lack of financial
success.
UCLA had long opposed reviving
the tournament along with Stanford
and Arizona, but Director of Athletics
Peter Dalis voted in favor this time

around alter a new proposal involving
the Staples Center was introduced.
Fox Sports, a part owner of the arena,
would televise the tournament with
the hopes of attracting large crowds
and sizable commercial revenue.
The tournament itself would in
clude the top eight teams in the con
ference following the regular season,
ending with the championship game
on the Saturday before NCAA tourna
ment selections are announced. The
winner of the tournament would re
ceive the N( CAA's automatic bid for the
conference. The women's tournament
would have the same format but would
be held at a campus site and would in
clude all 10 teams.
The conference schedule will likely
be shifted partially into December to
allow room for the tournament, with
the first couple of games being played
over the holiday break.
Stanford Athletics Director Ted Le
land, while still opposing the tourna
ment, apparently had less of an issue
with the proposal than the last time it
was brought up, in 1998. His main
concern is for the amount of time the
student-athletes would spent on the
road.
"It's just a question of whether you
are pounding your athletes into the
ground," Leland told the Contra
Costa Times. "It's going to be another
fatiguing experience for them. But
this might be what we need to do to at
tract athletes (to the Pac-10) and gain
excitement."

Beginning in 2002, the Pac-10 may finally join the rest of the country in
having a postseason clash to call its own.
