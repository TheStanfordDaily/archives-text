Ah, the absurdity. The pointlessness. The flagrant
time-wasting. Yup, those good 'ol preseason college
football polls are starting to surface again, meaning
we're this close to starting the season again (23 days, give or
take a few hours). This being a Stanford newspaper, 1 sup
pose I could rant about how Stanford isn't getting any re
spect a year after winning the Pacific 10 Conference and
taking big bad Wisconsin all the way down to the 1:30 mark
in the Rose Bowl. But I'll get to that later.
No, my beef this time around is regarding the inherent in-

accuracy that preseason polls drag along
with them. And, lor that matter, polls in
general. But we'll get to diat later.
The esteemed Pac-10 media, of which I
am technically a member, recently voted
on who they believed would capture the
conference crown. Washington was the
pick, followed closely by our good friends
USC at No. 2. For the record, the Cardinal
are down at seventh, with California trail-

ing behind as usual in ninth (For the record, 1 didn't vote).
Before placing die tiniest ounce of stock in this poll, con
sider this fact: in four of die past seven seasons, the actual con
ference champion was picked to finish in the second half of the
league. Stanford, as you no doubt remember, was slotted for
eighth last year, while Arizona, the No. 1 choice and national
championship contender, fell on its face and landed in sixth at
the end of the year.
"It's better to say, hey, great, it's a positive for our program
that people believe Washington football is on the way back,"
Washington coach Rick Neuheisel told the Seatde Post-Intel
ligencer. '"I"hat said: I can't wait to go and tell my team this
doesn't mean anything."

Way to hit the nail on the head, Rick.
Why do we insist on taking these useless polls year after
year? So people will get interested in the season and argue
over whose team is more deserving? Please.
Personally, I think it's a part of a media conspiracy to make
a lousy choice so they can keep referring to it in their articles
and columns about how " is such a surprise team —
they were picked for ninth, and l<x>k at diem now!!"
These polls can't predict injuries, unheralded freshmen
stepping up, great coaching jobs, team unity and the most im
portant thing of all — heart. The things that make football
great are the unknowns, the players who never got noticed in
practice but suddenly step up to take on huge roles.
Look at who votes in these polls. Not the players or the
coaches, but the media. I'll be the first to admit that most of the
time we know the least about what's going on. We sit up in a
nice press lx>x with gtxxl... okay, free fixxl, drinks, and we get
the luxury of second-guessing the guys who make the hard
calls.
Demonstrating the solidarity of the media's choices, Stan
ford was picked anywhere from second to 10th in this year's
Pac-10 poll, and while the team did lose Troy Walters and
Todd Husak to the NFL, they will bring back 15 starters in ad
dition to a host of talented freshman, four of whom were blue
chip recruits. In short, the cupboard is not exactly bare.
"You really want my reaction?" Stanford coach Tyrone
Willingham said to the P-I. "I think it's consistent with what
has gone on most years... and I'll leave it at that."
For your sake, Tyrone, let's hope you're right.
