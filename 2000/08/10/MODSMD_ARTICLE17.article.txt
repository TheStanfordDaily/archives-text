## 'Coyote Ugly' is a disappointing Cinderella story 
### HILARY BIENSTOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Coyote Ugly" could have been a gcx>d
movie. The previews showed lots of attractive,
provocatively dressed women doing dances
on a bar, tossing liquor bottles around as they
poured shots and cooling down their mostly
male clientele with jets of soda-water whenev
er diings heated up too much. Its primary
shortcoming, it seemed, would be a tenuous

plot line. It looked, in other words, like the
next closest thing to soft-core porn.
Sadly, though, "Coyote Ugly" does have a
plot â€” a little too much of one. It's the story of
Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo), a sweet young
thing who leaves her small-town roots behind
her and tries to make it as a songwriter in Big
Bad New York City. She diligently peddles
her songs to record labels, and when, after sev
eral days, she is empty-handed and short on
cash, she takes a job in a wild-and-crazy psen

do-Western bar named Coyote Ugly. Alter a
few near calamities, she gets the hang of the
raunchy dances and the devil-may-care booze
flinging and becomes one of the best little bar
tenders in the place.
Of course, conflict ensues. Will Violet relin
quish her songwriter aspirations in favor of
her profitable and exciting "day job?" Will Vi
olet's newfound beau (Adam Garcia) be able to
help her overcome her stage fright? Will Vio
let's father (John Goodman) forgive his
daughter for her disreputable job? Too few
cool bar scenes alternate with the inevitable
sappy ones, and finally this movie shows its
true colors: it's a chick flick, and not a very
good one at that.
True, there are some high points to the
movie. Perabo, the result of a cross-country
casting search, is a fresh-faced, appealing
young heroine. Vihually incapable of looking
bad on camera, she seems earnest and well
meaning throughout the film. Adam Garcia is
cute, too, in a young John Travolta sort of
way, and he portrays his naively charming
character with a fair amount of success. And
veteran actor John Goodman is probably the
high point of the movie as Violet's widowed fa
ther, concerned for his daughter and ignoring
all her well-meaning advice about Lean Cui
sine as he licks KFC off his pudgy fingers.
The other characters, however, are merely
lackluster stereotypes who l<x>k pretty but do
little else. Violet's best friend (Melanie
Lynskey), a small-town girl with a New Jersey
accent you could c ut with a knife, specializes in
saccharine scenes that will be tear-jerking if
they weren't so laughably contrived. And of
course, the other Coyotes have their scripted

roles as well: the "Russian flirt" (Izabella
Miko), the "New York bitch" (Bridget Moyna
han) and the tough-yet-kind boss (Maria
Bello). Tyra Banks is cast as the smart one,
leaving Coyote Ugly for law school. But the
movie doesn't do justice to even these two-di
mensional roles.
The plot twists are similarly undeveloped:
after Violet and her man have a falling-out,
she is heartbroken because she thinks he's dat
ing another blonde, Coyote-esque hottie. But
it's clear that he's merely renting her a room,
and the audience is left wondering exactly
what Violet is so upset about.
The rest of the movie falls Hat in a similar
fashion. Violet's songs are not bad, and her
acoustic performances (sungby LeAnn Rimes,
who makes a cameo towards the end of the
movie) are reminiscent of Lisa Loeb's early
material. But they aren't as captivating as the
more upbeat, charismatic tunes of the bar
scenes. Even the boost of urban hip-hop that
supposedly takes Violet's music to the next
level is barely noticeable.
And, like the music, the rest of the film
moves disappointingly from a hard-edged
comedy to an uninteresting love story. With
too many heartfelt conversations under full
moons and t(x> few of the sexy, foot-stomping
bar numbers we were expecting, "Coyote
Ugly" is a movie that ultimately fails to satisfy.
