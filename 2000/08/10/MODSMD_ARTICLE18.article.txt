# O'Connor back in controversial style
## 
### MICHAEL BAER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After scoring a cult hit with debut
album The Lion and the Cobra, fea
turing the single "Mandinka,"
Sinead O'Connor hit the big time
with I Do Not Want What 1 Haven't
Got and its Prince-penned number
one hit, "Nothing Compares 2 U."
Her non-feminine l<x>ks — shaved
head and all — made her an unusu
al success story, but her mouth
would prove to be her downfall.
Lashing out at New Jersey,
"The Star Spangled Banner" and
former supporters U2 (whose
music she called "bombastic")
would have been enough to make
some shy away. But her "Saturday
Night Live" condemnation of the
"evil" Pope, along with her vocal
and financial support of the IRA
and refusal to apologize for these
controversial actions assured her
popular derision. Of course, it
didn't help that, in the 10 years fol
lowing her superstardom she re
leased a covers album of old stan
dards, an EP and a greatest hits col

lection but only one original
album, put out after most had
ceased to care.
In the past few years, she's put
out a song here and there on com
pilations and collaborations, but her
new album, Faith and Courage (At
lantic), is her first full-length effort
in nearly six years. In Faith and
Courage, Sinead conjures a torn
world where she works through the
problems of love — for father, for
daughter, for man and, yes, for
God. It has a highly spiritual bent
that is propelled by urban-influ
enced dance rhythms and ambient
background beats.
The stand-out songs — like fem
inist single "No Man's Woman" and
"Daddy I'm Fine" with its rebel yell
assurances — are the faster ones in
which she loudly asserts herself,
standing up for herself in a way she
was never able to — publicly any
way — in spoken words. Other
songs are gentler in their introspec
tion, sounding much like songs
from Peter Gabriel, Sinead's oft
time collaborator, in their dance
and world music influences.

"Jealous" is a tale of a spurned
lover whose former flame is jealous
of her finally getting over him. She
exhorts, "You don't know how hard
it is to be a woman in love with you /
When you're so cruel and so jeal
ous." Its cool, slow beats provide the
perfect background to this song of a
lover taken to task for his contradic
tions, even while the narrator has
contradictions of her own: "You
don't think about anybody's feel
ings but your own / Are you coming
home?"
Similar beats propel '"Til I Whis
per U Something," which is a tale of
a morose companion that fades out
with Sinead repeating, "If you've
never seen a good time, how would
you recognize one?" This is more an
argument than an insult, but then
again O'Connor is likely used to
being misinterpreted.
However, such slow and droning
beats make one wish there were
more musically upbeat songs, and,
even when only half of the 56-
minute album is over, it feels as
though the listener has traveled a
fair distance. O'Connor tries to

change the pace
every once in a
while, but Faith and
Courage stays slow
and sweeping for
most of its duration.
This string of beau
tiful sounds might
capture the listener
in its mood, but,
just as likely, might
encourage the lis
tener to switch to

something either more upbeat or
simpler yet engrossing in its sound.
Faith and Courage is a lovely
album, but it is not the comeback
Atlantic hoped for. The converted
likely will not be disappointed, but
it is unlikely to win O'Connor
many new fans.
Referring to her own contro
versies, O'Connor declares in
"What Doesn't Belong to Me,"
that "I'm Irish, I'm English, I'm
Muslim, I'm Jewish." She seems to
say that love transcends the brand
of faith one believes in, but it
seems as much scolding as loving
when she says "Take back the

shame you gave me / Take back
what doesn't belong to me."
The album ends with a reggae
version of Kyri Elison, which
many will likely see as blasphemy
of Rastafarianism, Christianity or
both, others as a perfect end to a
spiritual album. Even after so
many years, Sinead still courts
controversy.
