# lang keeps it light with Summer

### MICHAEL BAER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
k.d. lang's voice and style are
quite refined, especially compared
to most mainstream singers. Her
longing tone is a throw-back to by
gone eras. Starting out country,
moving to torch song and eventual
ly defining her own style, k. d. lang
has maintained a sense of individu
ality which has served her well, even
though the last few years haven't
yielded a hit for her.
In fact, in spite of her past prolifi
cacy, it's been live years since her last
album of original songs came out.
This album, All You Can Eat, was
preceded by the crossover hit In
genue and followed by the covers
album titled Drag. Now comes In
vincible Summer (Warner Bros.),
an appropriately sunny album on
which she has written or co-written
all but the first song, the dreamy
"The Consequences of Falling."
It is notable that the songs she co
wrote precede the songs she wrote
herself, though it's unclear if this is
because her songs were thought to
deserve to be saved for last or be
cause they were thought to be less
accessible than the more upbeat
songs preceding them. In my opin
ion, they're two of the best on the
album — "Curiosity" being a tale of
physical infatuation and "Only
Love" a tale of that four-lettered
Achilles heel.

k.d. lang waxes romantic on her
new album Invincible Summer.
The other songs are decent, too.
"Summerfling," the first single, is a
light and airy song about a light and
airy fling. Conversely, "Extraordi
nary Thing" is an ode to falling
deeply in love for (what seems like)
the first time. "It's Happening with
You" is a fun romp which explores
the lighter side of such love.
However, it's hard to come up
with better adjectives than "decent"
and "interesting" for most of the
album's songs because their struc
ture and instrumentation makes
them so light-sounding and ulti
mately forgettable. There's no hook
to hold the listener, and after a while
lang's emotional pleas are dulled
under the banal orchestration.
Because of this, the album is
truly less than the sum of its parts.
Perhaps the flighty atmosphere of
the album is intentional, but after
such a long silence it is neverthe
less disappointing.
