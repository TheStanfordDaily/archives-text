# Hold seconds on 'Fully Committed'

### AMANDA CANEVARO EDITORIAL STAFF 
1 lave you ever ordered jicama
smoked Scottish wood squab
poached in a ginger broth and
wrapped in wilted spinach or
herb-crusted grouper speckled
with fresh hyssop oil on a bed of
wild ramps? Or have you ever
called the trendiest, newest
restaurant looking for reserva
tions but found the first available

table is three months away?
II you have, then the deeply
frightening "Fully Committed" is
perfect for you. You're sure to rec
ognize yourself somewhere dur
ing the 90-minute one man show
written by Becky Mode and per
formed by Ethan Sandler. If you
haven't, well, you're in for a shock
ing behind-the-scenes look at the

restaurant industry.
While lie waits for his big break,
Sam (Ethan Sandler), a struggling
actor, must work as a reservation
ist at a posh New York City restau
rant. The very talented Sandler is
manic as he switches back and
forth between Sam and the myri
ad customers who call the restau
rant looking for everything from a
table for that night to a recitation
of the "global fusion" menu.
Highlights of the frequent
callers include Bryce, a super
model's assistant, who calls nu
merous times to remind Sam of
his client's all-vegan, no-female
wait staff and halogen lighting re
quests. Sam is also forced to try
and appease recurring caller Mrs.
Vanderveer, who has a complaint
and demands to speak to the tem
peramental coke-sniffing maitre'
d.
In between demanding cus
tomers, Sam's recently widowed
father calls to ask if Sam can come
home for Christmas. Sam must
ask for two days off from his sadis
tic boss, (he chef. The chef, who
sounds eerily like Jack Nicholson,
rejects Sam's request, and Sam's
father accepts with an innocent
and heartbreaking "Okey-doke."
All of this chaos takes place in
front of a wonderfully creative set
that gives the show authenticity
and adds to its satire . The restau
rant upstairs thrives on appear
ances and glamour, but Sam takes
reservations in a tackily decorated
basement.
Set right before Christmas, the
room is decorated with Christmas
lights, tinsel and a thrift store

Menorah as well as numerous
signs reminding ihe employees
not to give reservations to Ned
Finley. I he sign creates a mystery
that serves as a running joke
throughout the show, but the
joke's timing leaves its potential
unfulfilled.
Sandler sprints through the 90-
minute show never missing a heat
or leaving a dull moment, but the
show ends too quickly, leaving too
many loose ends untied. Sam's ac
tions toward the end of the show
are illogical and waste valuable
comedic potential.
The show wraps up too quickly
without giving any insight into
Sam. His personality gets lost in all
the characters he portrays and in
teracts with.
Hie show will be most enjoyed
by those employed in a similar in
dustry or those who frequent sim
ilarly popular and trendy restau
rants. Others will have a lew
laughs but will be more interested
in the personal dynamics of the
story that are left unresolved.
I he show is almost a 90-minute
inside joke for people connected
to the restaurant industry. This
frustrating situation detracts from
the enjoyment of the show for oth
ers. For industry insiders, make
your reservations now. Everyone
else should opt for take-out.
