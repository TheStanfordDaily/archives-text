# Live Human showcases DJ Quest's talent

### WILL TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
So what is one to make of these
young musicians today? I have often
ranted in these pages this summer
about a lack of innovation in R&B, a
lack of genuine talent in rock and
the inability of some people (cough
Sisqo cough) to talent their way out
of a paper bag. But I am not entire
ly a bitter old curmudgeon. There
are a number of good things out
there, and there are definitely
enough to prevent the demise of
true innovation in music.
To this end, I present to you Live
Human's new release, Elefish Jel
lyphant. Three musicians and vari
ous styles combining to bring an in
teresting twist on the electronic fu
sion scene. What makes this group
worth a listen? They are worth it al
most as much for what they are not
as for what they are.
What they are not is yet another
pretentious set of would-be high
rollers determined to bully their way
into a scene. What they are is a
group of guys who are adept at three
individual skills and bring them to

gether well enough to create some
thing that isn't quite jazz and isn't
quite ambient but that definitely is
good.
The group is comprised of three
members, I)| Quest (formerly of the
turntablist crew The Bulletproof
Space Travelers), Albert Mathias
and Andrew kushin. Mathias han
dles all the percussion instruments
while Kushin deftly handles bass
and strings. The star of the set,
though, and the glue bringing it all
together is the exhibitionism of
Quest. When he lags a track is hurt,
and when he shines a track soars
along with him. Quest is one of the
better turntablists in the business
today— easily at the level of the leg
endary Invisible Scratch Pikl/. when
he is at his best, and his worse is suit
able enough for a poorer Qbert or
Shadow interpretation.
'Hie CI) itself is a fairly smooth
blend of music, each track tending
to flow into the next yet allowing the
individuality of each cut to showcase
itself. 'Hie opening 50 seconds and
the last hidden track are the only
truly problematic aspects of the disk,
seeming somewhat unnecessary

and slightly abrasive. Track four, the
bass-heavy "Lost World," is a throw
back to another era of music, relying
mainly on the bass strings of Kushin
and something of a Congo drum
beat to carry it. The result is a jazzy
track that makes one feel as if he
should be sipping a martini and
waxing Sinatra.
It's followed by "Quick Eleven," a
bit of a letdown that is a little too
rough around the edges for it's sur
roundings. The error is soon cor
rected by "Eggroll Suite," a track
that reminds me of the "Termina
tor" theme music with a trippy
looped feel. "Everything Becomes
Jellyfish" and "Loopless" are tracks
that aspire to another line of reason
ing — one that suggests diat maybe
this type of musicality can work.
The biggest argument against
recognizing DJs as true musicians is
the lack of original music. Many say
that with a little practice anyone
could manage to use the music of
others to create something interest
ing sounding. This just isn't true,
and Quest and company set out to
show why in a number of ways. By
combining beats with two live instru

ments, Live Human is able to make
something that is a union of three
genres at once and which results in a
sound all its own.
Give the group a try as back
ground music while you are writing
or as just a little ambient noise to
your next chill session. It's worth it.
