## Stanford dominates GOP's unconventional 'pep rally' 
### GREG BRAZEAL EDITORIAL STAFF 
Thanks in large part to the Hoover Institution, Stanford
put in a strong showing at the Republican National Conven
tion last week. Not only did the University provide one of the
event's key speakers, ex-Provost and Senior Hoover Fellow
Condoleezza Rice, but several delegates at the convention
have their roots on the Farm.
Rice said that she really enjoyed the convention."It ex
pressed Governor Bush's very strong commitment to inclu
sion and the compassionate conservative philosophy," she
said.
"We had nine delegates, and without a doubt they were
some of the most influential people there," said Sam Abrams,
a research associate at Hoover who attended the convention
as a press delegate lor California.
Senior Hoover Fellow Martin Anderson made a more con
servative estimate of the Stanford presence, counting six del
egates and one alternate. Anderson himself played a promi
nent role at the convention. The delegates from California
elected him to serve on the convention's Platform Commit
tee. Arriving in Philadelphia a week early, he joined one male
and one female delegate from every state to formulate a state
ment of the ideals and values guiding the GOP. Anderson
chaired the Economics and Technology subcommittee.
"I wrote the platform for Silicon Vallev," he said.
Anderson described the atmosphere at the convention as
anything but sedate. "I've never been in a mosh pit," the 64-
year-old author and policy analyst said, "but from what I've
read about mosh pits, it was awfully close to a mosh pit. It was
extremely hot. We were packed in and screaming and
yelling."
Abrams concurred. "Basically, they would jump at any
thing. It was a giant pep rally."
But the Hoover associate had reservations about the con
vention's energetic guise. "It's just an excuse to try to rally
troops and show support and have a good time," he said.
"But when push comes to shove, if you ask them privately,
they probably didn't like it."
For Anderson, who has attended nine GOP conventions,
the intensity of feeling in Philadelphia was unique.

"As it proceeded, the first day, the second day, people just
got happier and happier," he said. "By the third day, you look
around — pure joy in their eyes. They were having a won
derful time. There was a feeling of togetherness. The lady sit
ting next to me was a Latino delegate from Los Angeles. She
was so impressed that finally she was crying, she was so happy.
I've never seen that at a convention."
The theme of the second night, when Rice spoke, was
"Strength and Security with a Purpose: Sate in Our Homes
and in the World."
"I didn't feel that 1 could do justice to all of foreign policy
in a 10-minute speech," Rice said, "so 1 opted instead to talk
about American values and philosophy and about what kind
of foreign policy President Governor Hush would be."
During the speech, Rice described how her grandfather
managed to stay in college after running out of the cotton he
had used as tuition. "Praise be, as he often does, God gave him
an answer. My grandfather asked how those other boys were
staying in school, and he was told that they had what was called
a scholarship. And they said, 'If you wanted to be a Presbyter
ian minister, then you could have one, too.' Granddaddv Rice
said, 'That's just what I had in mind.' And my family has been
Presbyterian and college-educated ever since."
Anderson called Rice's speech "terrific" and "dynamite."
Abrams, however, was slightly skeptical about the speeches as
a whole. "You could have put Democrats in there and you
would not have known the difference, because everything that
was said, we all agree with "
"I was personally very bored during the actual convention
part," he added. "I wonder how people like John Cogan and
John Taylor of Hoover can sit there."
Cogan could not be reached for comment.
As a press delegate, one of Abrams' jobs was figuring out
how the media would spin the convention."The media clear
ly was bored," he said. "There was really nothing to do there
.... For example, Tom Brokaw and I had a very long chat.
Tom Brokaw: Why would he want to talk with me, of all peo
ple? But he had nothing to do.
"It got to the point where reporters would interview other
reporters about the convention," Abrams added.
But Abrams agreed with Anderson that the convention
was, if nothing else, quite a production. "The organizers

pumped mist or some form of steam into the room, and you
couldn't see what was going on," he said. "And then they put
Hashing lights and spotlights through it so it sort of had this
mystical glow to it."
