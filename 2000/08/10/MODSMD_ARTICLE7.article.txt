# Stanford Blood Center replenished, but still in need
## 
### VICTORIA DAVIS EDITORIAL STAFF 
The critical shortage of blood at the Stanford Blood Cen
ter has been temporarily reduced due to a significant increase
in blood donors this past weekend. The center had been ex
periencing a near-crisis level of blood types () positive, () neg
ative, A positive, A negative and AB negative.
"We are very thankful to all the donors who responded
to our critical plea for blood," said Caryn Huberman, di
rector of the Stanford Blood Center. "We are doing a lot
better now and encourage everyone to please continue to
donate regularly."
Despite the doubling in donor numbers over the week
end, blood inventory still remains under the required min
imum number of units for certain blood types. As of yes
terday, the blood center had 151 units of the universal
blood type () positive in inventory. Though this was a sig
nificant increase in units from a previous low of 53, the 151
units still falls short of the 200 unit minimum for C) posi
tive. Huberman said that the center is "basically out of the
woods" but that more () negative and O positive units are
definitely still needed.
The center provides blood to four Bay Area Hospitals:

Stanford Medical Center, Lucile Packard Children's Hos
pital at Stanford, El Camino Hospital in Mountain View
and O'Connor I lospital in San Jose. A surge in patient de
mand for blood at local hospitals is one of the main con
tributors to the blood supply depletion. Many seriously ill
patients are in dire need of blood, such as a 14 year-old
boy who had an artificial heart transplant last Friday.
Other factors contributing to the shortage are the usual
drop in blood donors due to the summer season as well as
a reduction in the Stanford Blood Center's operating
hours because of a staffing shortage.
Low blood supply levels have forced local hospitals to
trade and import blood from hospitals around the nation,
but Peninsula and Bay Area hospitals are not the only ones
suffering from low blood supply levels. The problem is na
tionwide and has left many hospitals desperate for more
blood. Hospitals across the nation are averaging a mere day's
supply of blood, when the standard is a three-day reserve.
As patient blood demands continue to rise, so does the
need for donors. The components in each pint of blood can
help up to three people. "What else can you do in one hour
that can save peoples lives?" asks Huberman. "According to
estimates, if the 27,000 people a year that donate each give
one more donation than they presently give, we would never

have shortages," she said.
Donors have various options of when and where they can
donate their blood. The Stanford Blood Center provides
many opportunities for those who cannot make the regular
hours at the center. Next Monday, Aug. 14, ,Â» commuter
night will be held at the 800 Welch Road location from 5:30
p.m. to 7:30 p.m. On Wednesday, Aug. 30, the popular Sin
gles Night Beach Blanket BBQ will be held. More events can
be found on the Stanford Blood Center's Web site at
http://bloodcenter.stanford.edu.
The site provides a convenient way for donors to access in
formation about the center and its events and schedule ap
pointments. Appointment numbers have increased from 15
a week to 35-40 since the updating of the site.
"Our goal within the next six to seven months is to get
50 percent of all applications via the Web site," Huberman
said.
Community blood drives are held frequently, but
donors may also call (650) 723-7381 or (888) 723-7381 to
schedule appointments at either of the two Stanford Blood
Center locations at 800 Welch Road in Palo Alto or at 515
South Drive in Mountain View.
