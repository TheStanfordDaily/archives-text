# Summer construction heats up on campus
## 
### DENNIS TYLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Although construction and
renovation are nothing new to
Stanford, this summer has
brought an especially high level
of construction throughout the
campus â€” even more so than
usual.
The Stanford post office, Stan
ford Bookstore, Escondido Vil
lage and Toyon Hall are only a
few of the many sites undergoing
renovation.

New post office
opens Aug.2l
The new post
office, which has
been under con
struction since
January, is open
ing on Aug. 21
for the first time
to the public.
The temporary
post office, locat
ed near the field
adjacent to Flo
rence Moore
Hall, will be
open until Aug.
18 and will then
be shut down
while the P.O.
boxes are
moved from it
to the new facil
ity-
"The reno-

vated post office will be unique be
cause of the retail merchandise that
will be sold. Post office retail stores
are the new wave of the future and
we are keeping up with that trend,"
said Fddie Masangcay, Manager of
Customer Services for the post of
fice.
In addition to selling merchan
dise, the post office has been
made more space efficient, giving
it a bigger feel.
"The post office is more space
efficient because in the old post
office there were carriers who
were stationed within the post of
fice occupying a lot of space. To
make more space available, those
carriers were moved to the main
post office in Palo Alto," said
Masangcay.
Having more space within the
post office has allowed for a lot of
upgrades within the facility.
There are more parcels for large
packages, easier accessibility for
the handicapped and convenient
hours for students.
"The reason for the renovation
in the first place was to create bet
ter service for our customers. We
have created a new, sleek post of
fice in a service friendly environ
ment," said Masangcay.
Some students, however, ques
tion whether the service at the
post office will be better, regard

less of the new renovation.
"I don't know if the renovation
is going to do anything because
half of the post office problem was
with the employees and not nec
essarily the old facility," said ju
nior communications major
Misty Espinoza.
But Masangcay has said that
the employees will go through
training to better cope at the new
facility.
"The employees from the tem
porary location will continue to

work at this new facility. The op
eration here is different than the
older facility so our current em
ployees will be going through
training beginning next week,"
Masangcay said.
The postmaster says that con
struction is ahead of schedule.
The proposed end date of con
struction was in the beginning of
September, but now the new fa
cility is set up to open on Aug. 21
at 9 a.m.
"The construction has gone
extremely well. We have not met
any problems so far and are ready
to open up to the public," said
Postmaster Masa Sato.
Stanford Bookstore undergoes
remodeling
One of the other major cam
pus renovations has been the
Bookstore. The Bookstore began
its construction immediately after
commencement on June 12. The
proposed end date is Sept. 8.
"The renovation is on sched
ule, and in many areas, ahead of
schedule. The project manager
and contractors have worked well
together to meet the deadlines
set," said Jef Friedel, the market
ing manager of the Bookstore.
While there will be no major
changes, Friedel says that the

Bookstore "was due for some up
grades and repairs from simple
everyday wear and tear. Beyond
that, when the Follett corporation
gained the contract last year the
renovation was part of that con
tract."
In addition to upgrades and
repairs, there will be some re
modeling on the inside of the
store.
"The Bookstore's course mate
rials and mezzanine levels will
have an updated, modern 'high-

tech' look," said Friedel. "The
supply department will move to
the mezzanine level to be closer to
course materials. The main level

and upper level will be designed
in the mission oak look with
added soft seating and an ex
panded Cafe. The Stanford Com
puter Store will be located where
the supply department used to be
on the upper level.
"The new bookshelves and
gondolas have a much better, cus
tomer friendly design. Areas have
been added for much needed
storage without adding any
square footage to the existing
space and without impacting the
sales area," said Friedel.
Undergraduate housing reno
vated while new graduate hous
ing built
Besides the renovation of the
post office and Bookstore, the
University has set forth a compre
hensive construction plan for
housing on campus. As a part of
the Capital Improvement Pro
gram (CIP), which is a 15-year,
$185 million renewal program
for University residences at Stan
ford, numerous graduate and un
dergraduate residences have un
dergone major construction over
the last eight years since the pro
gram's inception in April of 1993.
The goal of the program is to
upgrade Stanford's older resi
dences to make them more com
parable to newer ones and to pro
vide additional on-campus hous
ing for graduate students.
This summer the graduate
housing under construction is Es
condido Village and the major
construction for undergraduate
housing isToyon Hall.
According to Director of Stu

dent Housing Roger Whitney,
"All of Escondido has been re
modeled over the last six years he
cause of the CI P."
But because of the graduate
housing strain a new program, ti
tled the Escondido Village infill,
has been formed to create new
housing for graduate students. As
a result, Studio 1, 2, and 3 apart
ment buildings are being built to
accommodate graduate students.
Studio 1 is located next to Mir
rielees apartments, Studio 2 is lo
cated on Campus Drive and Stu
dio 3 is located within Escondido
Village near Hulme Mid rise and
between Angel and Dudley
Courts.
"These studios have been re
ferred to as efficiency apartments
because they are so sell con
tained. Each apartment has a
kitchen, bathroom, living room
and bedroom all in one large
room," said Whitney.
Overall, Whitney has been ex
tremely satisfied with the construc
tion progress, especially given
the extenuating circumstances.
"The construction has been
an absolute success. Although
it has been extremely difficult
renovating while students are
living in the building, every
thing has turned out excel
lently," Whitney said.
Not only has the graduate
housing been on budget, it has
also been on schedule. Construc
tion began in June of 1999 and
two of the studios will be ready for
the upcoming quarter. Studios 1
and 2 will open in the fall as ex
pected and Studio 3 will open in
the winter, all together providing
