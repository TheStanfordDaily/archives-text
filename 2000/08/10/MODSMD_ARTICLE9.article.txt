# Shaping the fixture of Stanford
## 
### GREG BRAZEAL EDITORIAL STAFF 
No two documents are more
likelv to determine the future
shape, size and stature of Stanford
than the General Use Permit (GUP)
and Community Plan currently
under review hv the Santa Clara
County Planning Commission. To
gether the documents make up
Stanford's proposed 10-year devel
opment plan. If they are accepted,
the next decade will bring more
new development to the campus
than it has ever seen, even during

the University's foundation.
Few would deny Stanford's
need for housing. In an area where
$1,900 pays the average apart
ment's monthly rent and graduates
receive yearly stipends as low as
$ 17,000, the housing crisis is a daily
fact of life. Likewise, no one denies
that a university needs some de
gree of development to remain
competitive.
The controversial plan, released
in November of last year, proposes
upward of 2 million square feet of
academic development and rough
ly 3,000 units of new housing for

students, faculty, stall and hospital
residents. In his resignation an
nouncement, University President
Gerhard Casper focused on ap
proval of the 10-year plan as a pri
ority for his last months in office.
Casper steps down on Aug. 31, and
Santa Clara County will deliver a
decision on the plan Oct. 31.
Environmentalists read the plan
as a first step toward the defoliation
of the Foothills. To them, it propos
es the construction of a new city the
size of three Stanford Shopping
("enters. Golf fans find in the pro
posal the unnecessary disfigure

ment of a historical golf course, an
architectural marvel where Tiger
Woods and Tom Watson polished
their swings. Supporters of the plan
see it as a reasonable, moderate,
balanced request from a university
doing publicly beneficial work and
striving to become the best of its
kind in the world.
Oddly enough, these points of
view may not be as far apart as they
seem. There are primarily two is
sues at stake: the future of Stan
lord's open spaces and the fate of
the golf course. Both pivot on the
question of "infill."
The limits of infill
The development plan's critics, a
varied group including environ
mental organizations, golf fans and
area residents with traffic concerns,
insist that the University can meet
its academic and housing needs en
tirely through higher density infill
ing on the core campus, especially
by replacing surface parking lots
with parking structures.
"What Stanford is trying to do is
build out to the corners and then
come back with infill," the Stanford
()pen Space Alliance's (S( )SA) Peter
Drekmeier told the Santa Clara
County Planning Commission at a
packed public hearing last week.
"Patently untrue," Larry Horton
responds. Horton is the director of
the University's government and
community relations. "Patently un
true, and in fact it's demonstrably
untrue. You can go around the cam
pus right now, and what do you see
taking place: infill development."
Horton maintains that calls for
greater infill miss the point. "The
truth of the matter is that we don't
do anything but infill develop
ment .... What is sort of distress
ing at these hearings is that people
with great anger urge us to do pre
cisely what we are doing and have
been doing for some time."
But Palo Alto City Council Mem
ber Nancy Lvtle says that Stanford
has yet to demonstrate the necessity
of building on the golf course or ex
panding into open spaces. She
points to the 1,600 acres of surface
parking lots on Stanford's lands,
many if not all of which could be
converted to space-saving parking
structures.
"I'm not convinced that they've
exhausted all possibilities on the
surface lots," Lytle said.
Some golfing fans take a more
combative stance. "Stanford devel
opers do not know the difference
between their shrines and their
parking lots," golfer Richard Harris
told the planning commission. For
mer Stanford Chinese History Prof.
Lyman P. Van Slyke said that the

proposed construction would re
duce the golf course to "a shell ofits
former self."
Palo Alto resident Eddie Keating
echoed Lyde's suggestion, putting a
positive spin on preservationists'
demands by comparing Stanford
development to a sonnet: "Con
straints encourage creativity."
Many critics of the plan cite the Uni
versity's recent completion of the
Science and Engineering Quad as
an example of creative, high densi
ty development.
Horton cites the new quadrangle
as evidence that Stanford is already
using infill strategies and will con
tinue to do so. Indeed, he refers to
the golf course construction as infill,
as well as the construction planned
for the Lathrop District, described
below. "While *ve're planning on 2
million square feet of development
and 3,000 housing units, it's all infill
development," Horton said. "All of
it. Every bit of it. The whole thing is
infill development."
Neuman argues that the ques
tion of infill is tied to the question
of communities for families, sin
gles and partners, which require
child care and recreation centers,
as well as separation from labs, of
fices and other "generally non
compatible activities."
"The Stable Site, with hole num
ber one included, is really our only
site that meets these criteria at a rea
sonable density level," Neuman
said, referring to the planning area
that contains the first fairway of the
Stanford Golf Course. "Most sur
face parking lots are slated already
for academic buildings or graduate
and hospital resident housing and
are being replaced by expensive
parking structures, some above and
some below ground."
"It's not realistically feasible, any
more than it's feasible to say that all
the area's housing needs could be
met in the town of Woodside if they
didn't have acre-and-a-half lot min
imums, and they were willing to put
up high-rise apartments," said bob
Rosenzweig, a longtime Palo Alto
resident.
"The reality is," Horton said,
"that people like housing in the ab
stract, but they dislike almost any
and all specific proposals."
But if the plan is not feasible
through infill alone, some critics
question whether the University
needs as much academic develop
ment as it proposes. At last week's
hearing, the Committee for Green
Foothills' (CFG) Tom Jordan sug
gested that the county investigate
allowing all of Stanford's proposed
3,000 housing units but only half of
the 2.1 million square feet of acade
mic development. He criticized the
draft version of the Environmental


from Stanford University Community Plan, Nov. 15, 1999
The 10-year development plan proposes no development for the Foothills District. Area B cannot be developed
until 2020. The Stable Site, and the first hole of the Stanford golf course, are proposed as housing sites.
Impact Report (EIR) for overlook
ing this possibility. "It wasn't even
an alternative," he told the planning
commission.
Setting aside the question of
whether Stanford really needs as
much academic development as it
has proposed, the public debate
currently in progress hinges on a
point that virtually no one in
volved is qualified to judge:
whether or not it would be possible
for Stanford to achieve through in
fill the sort of community it plans
to create through restructuring
the golf course.
Even if Stanford proves that it
has no room outside the golf course
to build the housing it needs, there
may be a way to avoid choosing be
tween golf course and community.
Area B until 2020
Some critics have proposed
remedies that might cause more
harm to open spaces than the plan
itself. Several speakers at last week's
hearing proposed initiating devel
opment in the 126-acre Arboretum,
Stanford's historically protected
open space and green belt between
the Oval and El Camino Real. One
called the land an "Aussie wheat
patch," another a "fire hazard."
Another hypothetical area of de
velopment that has only recently
come to light is the 139-acre Area B
(see graphic), a stretch of land along
Sand Hill Road which is restricted
from development until 2020 by a
three-party agreement between
Stanford, Palo Alto and Santa Clara
County.
"The ironic stuff is all that talk
about the golf course and the lower
holes," Horton said, "and we can't
do anything [in Area B] until 2020."
The original restrictions on the
area were established in the '80s but
were reinforced during negotia
tions over the Sand Hill Road pro
ject to guarantee that Sand Hill
would remain a scenic highway.
Horton suggested that Stanford
may be talking to the city of Palo
Alto about loosening the restrictions
governing Area B, but he hastened
to add, "It's a signed contract, and I
can tell you, we're not going to go
back on it lightly. We won't do it un
less we sort of trade space, I think."
Lytle said that Area B might be a
better candidate for development
than the first fairway of the golf
course but pointed out that if Stan
ford can accommodate all of its de
velopment through infill, neither
Area B nor the golf course will re
quire alteration. "What I would cer
tainly be open to is looking for a dif
ferent place for Stanford to do that
housing. But my first place to look
would be the 1,600 acres of surface
parking lot that are now on Stan
ford lands," Lytle said.
The Lathrop District
Another contentious question
about Stanford's plan is whether it
sufficiently protects the open spaces
in the Foothills. The plan guaran

tees no development in the Foothills
District for the next 10 years, the life
span of the proposal. But environ
mental groups like SOSAargue that
what people mean when they say
"the foothills" — the grassy area
southwest of Junipero Serra Blvd.
— includes both the Foothills Dis
trict and the 154-acre Lathrop Dis
trict. Stanford's proposal does in
clude some slight development in
Lathrop: 20,000 square feet, or 0.5
percent of the area's total acreage.
"Anything we do would be low
intensity and academic. We're
putting a few things in already de
veloped areas," Horton said.
"Housing can't go in Lathrop."
Horton also said that the Lath
rop District is "fundamentally" al
ready 85 percent developed. He
pointed out that 11 holes of the golf
course, the golf course clubhouse,
the Center for the Advanced Study
of Behavioral Sciences, the National
Bureau of Economic Research, the
Lathrop House and several artists
studios are already situated in the
area.
The planned 21,000 square foot
Carnegie institution planned for
Lathrop, Horton said, "has been
foolishly made a cause celebre by
our opponents. But it is not a Stan
ford project, and it is not part of the
2 million square feet." Stanford
leased the land to the Carnegie in
stitution under the University's last
General Use Permit.
Far more disconcerting to envi
ronmental groups than the 41,000
square feet that might be developed
in Lathrop during the next decade
is Stanford's planned redesignation
of the Lathrop District as "Academ
ic Campus." The district currently
shares the designation of the
Foothills District as "Open Space
and Academic Reserve."
The draft Environmental Im
pact Report for Stanford's 10-vear
plan, prepared for the county by an
independent consultant with Stan
ford funding, states, "It is reason
ably foreseeable that the change in
designation has been requested to
allow for a greater degree of future
development in the area."
A pamphlet produced by SOSA
adds, "After 10 years, the land could
be developed as densely as the rest
of the campus."
Stanford's proposal lends cre
dence to this theory by suggesting
an "Academic Growth Boundary"
that makes no distinction between
Lathrop and the rest of campus.
"Stanford hasn't showed that
they've used up all the development
on the campus area," Jordan told
the commissioners last week. "Why
move the line?"
The Academic Growth Bound
ary would be part of Stanford's
special section in Santa Clara
County's Community Flan, rather
than a part of the University's
General Use Permit (GUP) from
the county. While the GUP will
have a 10-year duration and will
entitle Stanford to build specific
developments, the Community
Plan serves as a framework for

county decisions regarding Stan
ford development proposals. The
distinction is essential for the Uni
versity because it suggests a com
mitment to the permanent preser
vation of the Foothills District.
Horton says that Stanford redes
ignated the land in order to make
the plan more accurate. "This is a
distinctly different area from the
rest of the open spaces," he said, ar
guing that because both sides of the
street have golf courses, both sides
of the street should have the same
designation. As far as development
of Lathrop goes, Horton said, "We
certainly wouldn't come in with
anything, even any suggestion, for
10 years, and it may be that even
after that we wouldn't."
At last week's hearing, Palo Alto
resident Kathleen Much said that
further Lathrop development
would not be a loss of open space.
"It has been developed for over 100
years," she said, referring to the
construction of the Lathrop House
in 1890. Much pointed out that the
district is far from being a pristine
wilderness (see photos).
The city councils of Palo Alto and
Menlo Park, the Mid-peninsula Re
gional Open Space District and en
vironmental groups such as SOSA
have all called upon Stanford to
guarantee permanent open space
dedication for the Foothills District.
County land rights
Jordan emphasized that it is
within Santa Clara County's power
to make permanent open space
dedication a condition of allowing
Stanford to proceed with the rest of
its plan. He also noted that the
county is not even required to con
sult Stanford regarding its Commu
nity Plan, so Stanford's proposed
academic growth boundary is en
tirely optional.
"The county can say 'no,' or it
can say 'yes' with conditions, and the
conditions might be dedication of
the land," Jordan said. He hastened
to add that dedication does not
imply public access to the Foothills,
though he suggested another con
dition of acceptance could be limit
ed public access on a few trails.
When asked how Stanford
would respond if Santa Clara Coun
ty made permanent open space
dedication a condition of accepting
the development plan, Horton said,
"We would certainly resist anything
that would be a taking of our lands."
Jordan argued that open space
dedication would not be "taking"
because the decision would be
Stanford's. "If it doesn't want to
develop further," Jordan said,
"then it doesn't, and then the land
stays as it is. Or it does develop fur
ther, and it has to comply with the
conditions."
The University's last Ceneral
Use Permit, in 1989, provided for 2
million square feet of development,
including both academic and hous
ing construction. Jordan said at a
July 20 teach-in on the develop
ment plan, "The county has never

said 'no' to Stanford." He pointed
out that throughout the 1989 plan
the county proposed alternatives to
Stanford's proposals, but "through
out the alternative section, all the al
ternatives were rejected because
'the applicant would not agree.'
That is not a good reason."
The layout
Stanford owns 8,180 acres of
land, only half of which lies within
Santa Clara County unincorporat
ed land (see graphic). The proposed
10-year development plan does not
apply to the University's lands in
Palo Alto, Woodside, Menlo Park,

Portola Valley and unincorporated
San Mateo County.
The argument has been made
that many universities situated in
urban tenters, without Stanford's
land reserves, manage to stay com
petitive without expanding. At the
July 20 teach-in, Denice Dade of
CFG said, "Most other top-ranking
universities don't have a fraction of
this land." Palo Alto resident Stan
Christensen extended her claim at
last week's hearing, saying, "Stan
ford has more square feet devel
oped than any of the top 10 univer
sities."


While it may Ik* true that Stanford owns
more land than its competitors, University
Architect David Neuman says that the Farm
does not, in fact, have more developed land
than similarly esteemed universities, for ex
ample. Harvard. He points out that while
Harvard's total population is only 35 percent
larger than Stanford's, their academic space
is 54 percent larger, including 2,300 units of
graduate housing to the Farm's 4,000. "They
also have significant projects in their pipeline
totaling nearly 1 million square feet," he
added.
But Jordan makes the case that a develop
ment project in a built-out urban center, such
as Columbia's or Harvard's or Yale's, will in
volve the removal of less effective buildings
even step of the way. Stanford's plan, on the
other hand, occasionally proposes building
new facilities in new places while leaving more
outdated structures standing.
Horton argues that the severity of the re
gional housing crisis around Stanford makes
the University's position unique. "The reason
Stanford is building the housing is because of
the regional housing shortage," he said. "I'm
not aware of anv university in America that
provides as much housing now as we do for
our students, faculty and start."
"It's not as though we have any lust for
growth," Horton added. "At all."
Bio-X and beyond
One of the most important and frequently

overlooked aspects of Stanford's plan is the
specific developments it proposes: a 12,000
seat basketball arena, information technology
facilities, possibly even a joint Palo Alto-Stan
ford performing arts center to help relieve the
current rehearsal and performance space
crunch on campus. Central among the Uni
versity's proposals are the buildings that will
help bring to fruition the interdisciplinary
Bio-X program, which will operate at the in
tersection of biology, physics, chemistry and
engineering.
Provost and President-elect John Hen
nessy, who drew attention to the program last
October by attracting a $150 million donation
from Netscape co-founder James Clark, calls
the proposed Clark Center "the most interdis
ciplinary new endeavor we have undertaken
in the roughly 20 years I have been at Stan
ford."
A University-produced booklet summariz
ing and explaining the 10-year plan states that
"the federal government is expected to invest
heavily in interdisciplinary, biologically based
research in the coming decade." Bio-X facili
ties are a tangible example of the link between
a University's ability to develop and its com
parative stature.
In Hennessy's words, "Stanford is in an al
most unique position to take advantage of this
type of opportunity because of the strength
and close proximity of the medical school, en
gineering and the science departments."
Public hearings over the development plan
continue Sept. 7 at 6:30 p.m. in the Palo Alto
City Council Chambers, 250 Hamilton Ave.
The Santa Clara Board of Supervisors will
make final decisions regarding the plan on
Oct. 31.
