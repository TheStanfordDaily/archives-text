# Shaping the fixture of Stanford
## 
### GREG BRAZEAL EDITORIAL STAFF 
No two documents are more
likelv to determine the future
shape, size and stature of Stanford
than the General Use Permit (GUP)
and Community Plan currently
under review hv the Santa Clara
County Planning Commission. To
gether the documents make up
Stanford's proposed 10-year devel
opment plan. If they are accepted,
the next decade will bring more
new development to the campus
than it has ever seen, even during

the University's foundation.
Few would deny Stanford's
need for housing. In an area where
$1,900 pays the average apart
ment's monthly rent and graduates
receive yearly stipends as low as
$ 17,000, the housing crisis is a daily
fact of life. Likewise, no one denies
that a university needs some de
gree of development to remain
competitive.
The controversial plan, released
in November of last year, proposes
upward of 2 million square feet of
academic development and rough
ly 3,000 units of new housing for

students, faculty, stall and hospital
residents. In his resignation an
nouncement, University President
Gerhard Casper focused on ap
proval of the 10-year plan as a pri
ority for his last months in office.
Casper steps down on Aug. 31, and
Santa Clara County will deliver a
decision on the plan Oct. 31.
Environmentalists read the plan
as a first step toward the defoliation
of the Foothills. To them, it propos
es the construction of a new city the
size of three Stanford Shopping
("enters. Golf fans find in the pro
posal the unnecessary disfigure

ment of a historical golf course, an
architectural marvel where Tiger
Woods and Tom Watson polished
their swings. Supporters of the plan
see it as a reasonable, moderate,
balanced request from a university
doing publicly beneficial work and
striving to become the best of its
kind in the world.
Oddly enough, these points of
view may not be as far apart as they
seem. There are primarily two is
sues at stake: the future of Stan
lord's open spaces and the fate of
the golf course. Both pivot on the
question of "infill."
The limits of infill
The development plan's critics, a
varied group including environ
mental organizations, golf fans and
area residents with traffic concerns,
insist that the University can meet
its academic and housing needs en
tirely through higher density infill
ing on the core campus, especially
by replacing surface parking lots
with parking structures.
"What Stanford is trying to do is
build out to the corners and then
come back with infill," the Stanford
()pen Space Alliance's (S( )SA) Peter
Drekmeier told the Santa Clara
County Planning Commission at a
packed public hearing last week.
"Patently untrue," Larry Horton
responds. Horton is the director of
the University's government and
community relations. "Patently un
true, and in fact it's demonstrably
untrue. You can go around the cam
pus right now, and what do you see
taking place: infill development."
Horton maintains that calls for
greater infill miss the point. "The
truth of the matter is that we don't
do anything but infill develop
ment .... What is sort of distress
ing at these hearings is that people
with great anger urge us to do pre
cisely what we are doing and have
been doing for some time."
But Palo Alto City Council Mem
ber Nancy Lvtle says that Stanford
has yet to demonstrate the necessity
of building on the golf course or ex
panding into open spaces. She
points to the 1,600 acres of surface
parking lots on Stanford's lands,
many if not all of which could be
converted to space-saving parking
structures.
"I'm not convinced that they've
exhausted all possibilities on the
surface lots," Lytle said.
Some golfing fans take a more
combative stance. "Stanford devel
opers do not know the difference
between their shrines and their
parking lots," golfer Richard Harris
told the planning commission. For
mer Stanford Chinese History Prof.
Lyman P. Van Slyke said that the

proposed construction would re
duce the golf course to "a shell ofits
former self."
Palo Alto resident Eddie Keating
echoed Lyde's suggestion, putting a
positive spin on preservationists'
demands by comparing Stanford
development to a sonnet: "Con
straints encourage creativity."
Many critics of the plan cite the Uni
versity's recent completion of the
Science and Engineering Quad as
an example of creative, high densi
ty development.
Horton cites the new quadrangle
as evidence that Stanford is already
using infill strategies and will con
tinue to do so. Indeed, he refers to
the golf course construction as infill,
as well as the construction planned
for the Lathrop District, described
below. "While *ve're planning on 2
million square feet of development
and 3,000 housing units, it's all infill
development," Horton said. "All of
it. Every bit of it. The whole thing is
infill development."
Neuman argues that the ques
tion of infill is tied to the question
of communities for families, sin
gles and partners, which require
child care and recreation centers,
as well as separation from labs, of
fices and other "generally non
compatible activities."
"The Stable Site, with hole num
ber one included, is really our only
site that meets these criteria at a rea
sonable density level," Neuman
said, referring to the planning area
that contains the first fairway of the
Stanford Golf Course. "Most sur
face parking lots are slated already
for academic buildings or graduate
and hospital resident housing and
are being replaced by expensive
parking structures, some above and
some below ground."
"It's not realistically feasible, any
more than it's feasible to say that all
the area's housing needs could be
met in the town of Woodside if they
didn't have acre-and-a-half lot min
imums, and they were willing to put
up high-rise apartments," said bob
Rosenzweig, a longtime Palo Alto
resident.
"The reality is," Horton said,
"that people like housing in the ab
stract, but they dislike almost any
and all specific proposals."
But if the plan is not feasible
through infill alone, some critics
question whether the University
needs as much academic develop
ment as it proposes. At last week's
hearing, the Committee for Green
Foothills' (CFG) Tom Jordan sug
gested that the county investigate
allowing all of Stanford's proposed
3,000 housing units but only half of
the 2.1 million square feet of acade
mic development. He criticized the
draft version of the Environmental


from Stanford University Community Plan, Nov. 15, 1999
The 10-year development plan proposes no development for the Foothills District. Area B cannot be developed
until 2020. The Stable Site, and the first hole of the Stanford golf course, are proposed as housing sites.
