## Hyman to join Olympic squad in Sydney 
### BEN ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Richard Quick might have
feared for a while that he'd he a little
lonesome in Sydney this summer.
Going into last week's Olympic
Trials in Indianapolis, the Stanford
women's head swimming coach,
now the coach of the women's
Olympic Team, was the United
States' lone representative of Car
dinal swimming with a plane tic ket
down under in hand.
Now there are more. Senior
Misty Hyman claimed her passage
to Sydney Saturday night with an
electrifying victory in the 200-
meter butterfly, finishing with a
time of 2 minutes, 9.27 seconds.
"It feels so good, it hasn't hit me
yet," Hyman said after her victory.
"I am so excited. It's a dream."
Hyman seized the race from the
start, bolting out to the front â€” a
move that almost cost her the win.
"I didn't realize how fast it was,
hut once I was out front I was going
to do anything I could to stay out
front. Toward the end of the race I
was so tired I almost just froze."

Gritting out the final 10 meters,
Hyman struggled to hold off a
charging kaitlin Sandeno, al
though the top two finishers are
guaranteed a spot on the Olympic
team.
"I was just so excited, and I
wanted to go for it. I wanted it so
bad, and there was no holding
back. I was relying on the training I
did all summer, and held onto it by
the skin of my teeth," said Hyman.
Hyman edged Sandeno for first
by 0.27 seconds, while Stanford ju
nior Shelly Ripple was just back in
fourth (2:13.30).
A 10-time U.S. national champi
on, Hyman was a 50- and 100-
meter butterfly world record hold
er on the short course before swim
ming's governing body restricted
use of her unique sideways under
water kick. Now concentrating her
efforts on the longer race, Hyman
is aiming for a medal in her first
Olympic appearance.
"I can now focus on the 200 fly.
The goal is simpler. I can perfect
my racing strategy, control my
nerves," Hyman said. "This has
been a good experience and a good

stepping-stone."
Hyman will have the support of
at least one current teammate in
Sydney. Senior Siobhan Cropper
will join the Cardinal contingent in
Australia, but she will compete
under the flag of Trinidad and To
bago. She is the national record
holder in the 50- and 100-meter
freestyle races and will also race the
100 butterfly.
Stanford alumna Jenny Thomp
son (Class of 1995), who still trains
with Quick at Stanford, took the
100 freestyle and 100 butterfly titles
and will compete in her third
Olympics. She is currently tied with
speedskater Bonnie Blair for the
most gold medals gathered by a fe
male in the United States at five but
is looking for her first individual
gold medal.
The Stanford men competed
well at the Trials also, though no
current members of the Cardinal
squad will be headed to the Games.
Sophomore Randall Bal just
missed out with his third place fin
ish in the 100-meter backstroke at
55.09 seconds, while senior Adam
Messner took eighth in the 200

freestyle in 1:51.27.
Tom Wilkens (Class of 1998) will
be headed to Sydney, however, in
the 100-meter breaststroke and the
200-meter individual medley by

virtue of a couple of second-place
finishes at the Trials.
Olympic competition in swim
ming commences Sept. 16 and
wraps up on Sept. 23.
