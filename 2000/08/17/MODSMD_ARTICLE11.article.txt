# 'Class' begins for football

### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Regular classes may not start until
Sept. 27, but Football 101, under Prof.
Tyrone Willingham, is getting an early
jump on things.
The season opener for the Stanford
football team up in the mountain out
post known as Washington State is but
a mere 16 days away, and time is of the
essence for bringing new starters up to
speed. The rookies, highlighted by
blue-chip recruits Kwame Harris,
Teyo Johnson and Anion Gordon,
came down to the Farm last week for
several practices before the rest of the
squad joined them on Saturday for the
team's first full workouts.
"In general we're working very
hard, and I think that the work our
young men did in the summer is evi
dent in the way they're practicing and
the way they're performing," said head
coach Tyrone Willingham following
practice on Tuesday. "We're not any
where close to where we need to be, but
our efforts and our focus are good."
The $64,000 question for Stanford
fans will be whether redshirt junior
Randy Fasani can step in at quarter
back for Todd Husak, who had a very
productive 1999 season thanks in part
to star wideout Troy Walters, who is
also gone. Anxious for playing time,

Fasani has taken the field as a tight
end, linebacker and special teams
player during his two-year stint with
the Cardinal and now finds himself
getting the opportunity he has waited
for complete with all the scrutiny and
expectations that come with it.
The word from insiders is that he
has been impressive in workouts so
far, building on a good showing in
the spring football game last April.
Of course, only one person's opinion
about Fasani really matters; so how is
he doing so far, coach?
"I'll say Randy has started camp
very well," said a smiling Willingham,
who declined to elaborate any further.
As for Gordon, Johnson and the
rest of the freshman crew, the (typical
ly) long and difficult adjustment to the
college game has begun, with Willing
ham liking what he sees thus far.
"I think they've handled things
very well, but you know there is an ex
cessive amount of learning taking
place, and that is always the case with
freshmen coming in, and they seem to
be doing a good job with it," Willing
ham said.
"Our [upperclassmen] understand
that we may need freshmen. It's not
like some teams where you treat fresh
men with hazing and different things;
our guys respect the fact that it could
be a freshman who has great deal of

impact on our football team."
Willingham's "guys," the veteran
core who will attempt to defend the
Cardinal's Pacific 10 Conference title,
apparently also have come out.of the
gate looking good after only three or
so ollic ial days of practice but weeks of
informal workouts together in the
summer.
"I've been impressed by our upper
classmen. I think Willie Howard, Rus
sell Stewart, De√üonnie Pitts, guys of
that nature, have come back as yon
would expect with leadership roles.
They're setting the tone for how we
work and how we do things, so that has
been very positive."
Willingham's distaste for presea
son polls is something he doesn't try
tft hide; this season, his team has
been picked for seventh in the con
ference by the media, one spot high
er than last year. Asked to comment
on the poll, the coach planted tongue
firmly in cheek and said, "I think that
is absolutely exciting, for the poll
sters, and they have once again
demonstrated their versatility and
knowledge."
Last year, of course, the team went
on to win the conference after being
picked for eighth.
Willingham will no doubt prepare
his team with that thought foremost in
their minds.
