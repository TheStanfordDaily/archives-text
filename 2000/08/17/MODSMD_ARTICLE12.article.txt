# Summer league heats up for Stanford players
## 
### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Consider this a warning for disciples
of solid, methodical, organized basket
ball: do not watch the San Francisco Bay
Area Pro-Am Summer Basketball
League. Stay away. In fact, stay far away.
The Pro-Am league is a feast for the
eyes of the Sportscenter fan, replete with
alley-oop dunks, behind the back passes
and countless, ill-advised 3-point shots.
Defense and solid passing are after
thoughts most of the time; but then
again, defense and solid passing won't al
ways get you noticed by the team from
Russia needing a flashy two-guard.
Started 22 years ago by Jon Green
berg, the Pro-Am league reels in players
from across the basketball spectrum,
running the gamut from tiny junior col
leges to top-flight college bailers to aging
journeymen gunning for one shot any
where, whether it be in the United States,
Europe or even Asia.
"It's an opportunity for players to
come back to the Bay Area both to play
and to have a meeting ground with other
players," Greenberg recently told the
San Francisco Chronicle. "It's an oppor
tunity for scouts to see the players in a
competitive environment. And, it's an
opportunity for fans — particularly
those who might not be able to afford to
see a regular-season college game — to
see a high quality league for free."
Among those taking part this sum
mer, as the league's season winds to a
close, are a pair of Stanford players — re

cently graduated swingman David Mose
ley and redshirt freshman Justin Davis,
who will make his Stanford debut at
power forward beginning in the fall.
Moseley plays for the Bay Pride team,
one of eight teams included within the
league. 1 lis reasons for joining the league
are clear; passed over in the NBA draft,
his best options for playing in the future
depend on teams off the beaten path see
ing him and giving him a chance.
"Knowing how to score, how to get
open . . . the stuffin the pro game is still
new to me," says Moseley, who hopes to
play overseas or in the International Bas
ketball League. "I felt that playing in the
Pro-Am league would help me adjust
and get ready for the next level.
Moseley is not the only Stanford play
er to take part in Greenberg's league;
only two years ago, his former teammate
Mark Madsen, recently drafted by the
L.A. Lakers, spent his summer up in the
City banging in the lane.
"My a ueer was definitely helped by
being in the Pro-Am league because it
gave me an opportunity to play against
top competition in a different format
than I'd been used to," said Madsen
when he took part in 1997.
Different format, indeed. The league
uses NBA rules, meaning that zone de
fenses are not allowed and that games
are split into four 10-minute periods
rather than the two halves most players
become accustomed to in college. Even
NBA players have been known to take
part; players with Bay Area ties such as
All-Stars Jason Kidd and Gary Pay ton

joined in on the fun for a couple of sea
sons, although it has become more rare
in recent years.
Then there are other little touches
that make the Pro-Am league unique.
The games are played inside Kezar Pavil
ion, a bastion of the City's hoops scene
for years that is really showing its age.
During timeouts and halftime, a swarm
of young children with their own balls
flood the court, tossing up wild shots —
and occasionally lingering on the court a
litde too long, as Moseley himself found
out when he had to encourage one squirt
in a Chris Webber jersey to get back in his
seat.
Admission is free for all, and the
games attracted a fairly large and in
volved crowd. And sure enough, when
some unlucky defender gets dunked on,
both benches and the crowd make sure
he knows it, replete with roof-raising and
shouting.
"It's a street atmosphere . . . play
ground ball in the gym. You gotta love
it,"says Moseley.
The league's 2000 season is almost fin
ished; Moseley's Bay Pride team is taking
on San Mateo in a best-of-three champi
onship this week, with Bay Pride losing
the first game of the series (and first of
the season) Tuesday by a 114-104 score.
Don't doubt that the San Francisco Pro-
Am league will be back next summer full
of the high-octane play and a crowd
friendly atmosphere — if you don't like a
little spice in your basketball, though,
just remember one thing.
You've been warned.
