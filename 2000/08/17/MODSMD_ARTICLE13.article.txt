Sager to land at Georgia Tech
Former Stanford pitcher Brian Sager
has decided to attend Georgia Tech for
what will likely he his final college season,
according to John Manuel of Baseball
America. Sager, who will enroll Monday
in time for the beginning of classes,
picked the Yellow Jackets over a host of
suitors including LSU, North Carolina,
Rice, Texas and Tulane.
The 6-foot-5, 230-pound junior
righthander will hop into Georgia Tech's
starting rotation immediately, where he
will bolster a staff expected to be one of the
best in the nation. In his final season at
Stanford, Sager went 6-1 with a 5.18
earned run average.
Stember falls short again
Stanford junior Michael Stember, who
claimed a spot on the Olympic Team with
a third-place finish in the 1,500-meter
run at the Olympic Trials last month,
missed in his most recent attempt to meet
the Olympic 'A' qualifying standard he
needs to keep his spot.
Stember missed the 3:36.80 standard
in his latest attempt in Zurich, Switzer
land last Friday, finishing 11th in the race
overall with a time of 3:37.54. In an inter
esting twist, former Stanford runner
Jason Lunn, who finished fourth at the
Trials, met the standard by running a

3:36.74, meaning he will go in Stember's
place if the junior cannot meet the
Olympic standard by Sept. 11.
Stanford track and field head coach
Vin Lananna said Stember will run in at
least five more races as he tries to reach
the standard in time for Sydney.
