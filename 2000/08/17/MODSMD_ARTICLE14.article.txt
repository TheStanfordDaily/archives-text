## SF’s North Beach plays host to jazz artists and enthusiasts 
### JENN LINDSAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Underneath the sketchy neon
lights of North Beach's red light dis
trict, located in San Francisco, there
is a different kind of diva parading
herself to enthusiastic audiences.
Every year in late summer, the
annual North Beach Jazz Festival de
scends on Broadway and Columbus
in North Beach, showcasing a grand
variety of current jazz talent from the
Bay Area and beyond. Features
range from the Latin Jazz Series to
Jazz Poetry Nights to the New Or
leans swamp funk night. Even if
some offerings are dismal, most per
formances are most smashingly
worth the wait.
Iu highlighting the memorable
performances of this year's sixth an
nual North Beach Jazz festival, an
appreciative nod goes to vocalist
Kitty Margolis, who headlined the
JAZZ DIVAS evening with her in
comparable stage presence and
golden scatting.
Her vocal acrobatics and impro
vised scatting — shared back and
forth with the tones of her saxo
phonist — accompanied masterful
band leading as she cued them with

breath, dance moves and playful
vocal slides and glissandos. Her per
formance featured an impressive
synergy of musical leadership, tech
nical expertise, joy in her craft and a
huge personality.
In singing a song about San Fran
cisco's hazy North Beach district, she
remarked, "I'm a denizen of this sin
ful neighborhood, and my drum
mer's gonna show you how it sim
mers in the summer."
She performed a Tom Waits
cover (morphing her voice to remain
faithful to his doleful, vibrato-less
tone), a funktified show tune from
Rodgers and Hammerstein's "The
King and I" ("We Kiss in The Shad
ows"), which spotlighted her exquis
ite vocal control and depth.
No less versatile than the ebullient
vocalist, her accompanying musi
cians improvised masterfully, taking
the groove as Margolis danced and
played air drums. At one point the
soloing pianist was raging around on
the keyboard, and my date leaned
over to me and said, "I'm gonna go
watch this guy's hands."
He then proceeded to run to the
other side of the auditorium. If they
were anything like the bassist's lin
gers, from my seat, they couldn't be

seen between the blur of the impro
vised groove.
Margolis accesses every imagin
able vocal level — some of her scat
ting a cappella, some improvisations
in modes reminiscent of Indian
ragas. She attacks melodies in
smooth slides and staccato climbs,
crooning "Oh bo bee boo bai flip flip
flip" with dignity, a dynamic pres
ence and a palpable air of fun that
leaves the entire audience silent —
rapt with her gymnastic perfor
mance and finally erupting into ap
preciative applause.
()n the absolute polar end of the
spectrum were the grave tones of
Martha Cinader's Po'azz Yo'azz. The
premise was promising: improvised
spoken-word jazz poetry over the ir
regular strains of the Indian esraj
(classical stringed instrument) and
the styles of free-jazz drummer Arts
Lewis.
How unfortunate, though, that
her abysmal stage presence did not
make up for her monotonic drone of
platitudes: "I got lost on the tele
phone lines," she cried with gr eat se
rious urgency. "I GOT LOST ON
MY WEB PAGE!"
The more we watched this
woman the more we got a sense of

something about to happen — but it
never did. We waited for this woman
to explode lyrically, to say something
that she cared about—but there was
just the dissonant sawing of the esraj
and this woman howling, "I
PEELED OFF MY SKIN ANI)
FOUND MUSCLES!!"
She was so serious and gothic that
audience members may have been
tempted to take her seriously, but
Cinader's self-important, well
dressed yawing about slavery and
technology was ultimately self-de
feating.
Her accompaniment — the esraj
and free drumming — were both
wicked but indiscernible over Cin
der's illyrical poetry and strange
zoned drone. She was both disre
spectful and unresponsive to the au
dience, once asking, "Is anyone
OUT there?" when the tepid ap
plause did not satisfy her.
Although hers was an (uninten
tionally) comical performance, Cinad
er's Po'azz Yo'azz prevails in its desig
nation as the most dismal and deaden
ing performance at the Festival.
The Latin Jazz Series happily re
vived the standard set by vocalist
Kitty Margolis. The opening act
Five Degrees of Soul motivated the

crowd into energetic dancing to
their salsa, flamenco and Cuban
swing. The band's presence was not
only visually riveting, with the in
strumental rotation of all seven
band members each playing a min
imum of two instruments, but musi
cally impressive, featuring smooth
percussive transitions from song to
song or a percussive solo merging to
a single bass line.
Lead saxophonist Tommy ()w
-eleen proceeded to delight the ath
letic crowd in the finale song with his
simultaneous playing of the alto and
tenor saxophone. No kidding: two
reeds in his mouth. Their riveting in
strumentalist was more percussive
than melodic—even the melodic in
struments, like the frenetic horn sec
tion, contributed to a percussive
groove with both languid tones and
staccatoed bursts that were punctu
ated and Latinized by the underlying
bongo beat.
'Hie quality offerings of the Sixth

certainly outweigh the disappointing
efforts of certain artists. Luckily, the
organizers of the Festival work in t In
spirit of community involvement
and outreach, so most programs are
inexpensive* and accessible.

How unfortunate, though, that
her abysmal stage presence did not
make up for her monotonic drone of
platitudes: "I got lost on the tele
phone lines," she cried with gr eat se
rious urgency. "I GOT LOST ON
MY WEB PAGE!"
The more we watched this
woman the more we got a sense of

something about to happen — but it
never did. We waited for this woman
to explode lyrically, to say something
that she cared about—but there was
just the dissonant sawing of the esraj
and this woman howling, "I
PEELED OFF MY SKIN ANI)
FOUND MUSCLES!!"
She was so serious and gothic that
audience members may have been
tempted to take her seriously, but
Cinader's self-important, well
dressed yawing about slavery and
technology was ultimately self-de
feating.
Her accompaniment — the esraj
and free drumming — were both
wicked but indiscernible over Cin
der's illyrical poetry and strange
zoned drone. She was both disre
spectful and unresponsive to the au
dience, once asking, "Is anyone
OUT there?" when the tepid ap
plause did not satisfy her.
Although hers was an (uninten
tionally) comical performance, Cinad
er's Po'azz Yo'azz prevails in its desig
nation as the most dismal and deaden
ing performance at the Festival.
The Latin Jazz Series happily re
vived the standard set by vocalist
Kitty Margolis. The opening act
Five Degrees of Soul motivated the

crowd into energetic dancing to
their salsa, flamenco and Cuban
swing. The band's presence was not
only visually riveting, with the in
strumental rotation of all seven
band members each playing a min
imum of two instruments, but musi
cally impressive, featuring smooth
percussive transitions from song to
song or a percussive solo merging to
a single bass line.
Lead saxophonist Tommy ()w
-eleen proceeded to delight the ath
letic crowd in the finale song with his
simultaneous playing of the alto and
tenor saxophone. No kidding: two
reeds in his mouth. Their riveting in
strumentalist was more percussive
than melodic—even the melodic in
struments, like the frenetic horn sec
tion, contributed to a percussive
groove with both languid tones and
staccatoed bursts that were punctu
ated and Latinized by the underlying
bongo beat.
'Hie quality offerings of the Sixth
Annual North Beach Jazz Festival
certainly outweigh the disappointing
efforts of certain artists. Luckily, the
organizers of the Festival work in t In
spirit of community involvement
and outreach, so most programs are
inexpensive* and accessible.
