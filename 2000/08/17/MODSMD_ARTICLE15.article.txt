# Everclear returns with solid Songs
## 
### MICHAEL BAER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Everclear has been one of the
more predominant bands of the late
19905. Their first album was largely
ignored, but their second, Sparkle
and Eade, yielded several hit singles
with considerable air play, many
positive reviews and countless fans.
The next album, 1997's So Much
for the Afterglow, wasn't as well re
ceived by critics but solidified their
fan base. Like many great albums
(The Beatles' White Album, The
Rolling Stones' Exile on Main Street
and Led Zeppelin's III), it lacked
the stand-out singles of predeces
sors — and was a bit tired and messy
— but was nevertheless a leap for
ward, not backward.
Now, Everclear returns with
Songs from an American Movie,
Vol. One: Learning How to Smile,
which was originally slated to be its
lead singer's solo debut. Singer Art
Alexakis thought the more personal
yet experimental bent of the songs
he was writing did not suit Everclear
but eventually changed his mind,
which is for the best considering the
stellar results.
Clearly personal—an outgrowth
of his recent divorce — Learning
I low to Smile chronicles his trying to
understand the complexity of the

past and the chaos of the present
with hope for the future. As for ex
perimental, not really. The Ever
clear imprint is clear throughout the
album, even when they're doing
something new — which in many
cases is just reconfiguring the old.
The 1970s influence on the band
is quite clear, both musically and lyri
cally. John Prine and Otis Redding
are name-checked, "Mr. Big Shot" is
sampled, Van Morrison is covered
(a tasteful version of "Brown Eyed
Girl") and musical allusions to the
Stones, Bruce Springsteen and Zep
pelin abound.
As he makes clear in "AM Radio"
— even with a nostalgic coating —
Alexakis' '70s childhood was a tur
bulent one. Other songs make it
clear that his marriage was turbulent
as well. Chronicled are the rifts and
disagreements that lead to the disso
lution of many a romantic relation
ship. Many of these songs are mostly
acoustic and some draw from pop,
but all are pure Everclear. Alexakis,
over the album, comes to grips with
his current state, going through all
the emotions a divorcee would ex*
perience — anger, grief, sadness,
fear, nostalgia and even fantasy.
The last of these is in "Unem
ployed Boyfriend," which could be
called "1 Will Buy You a New Life,
Part. 2." As in that hit song, you're

not sure whether the hero is a savior,
a romantic, a loser or a mental case.
No matter what the case, Alexakis
excels in his ability to deliver the sen
sitive tough guy lines that reach
clown into the hearts of little girls
and grown men, saying, "Yes I will
treat you like a queen. I will go to all
those chick flick movies that I really
don't want to see." It may seem
laughable in print, but it's hard not
to believe with Alexakis' delivery.
However, instead of this novel
song, Everclear has chosen the
heartbreaking "Wonderful" as the
first single from this album. A gutsy
move, "Wonderful" being a plain
tive plea to a divorced couple from
their child: "I don't want to meet
your friend and I don't want to start
over again /1 just want my life to be
the same just like it used to be / Some
days I hate everything, I hate every
one and everything / So please don't
tell me everything is wonderful
now." How this will fare on radio is
difficult to guess, but on disc it's a
wrenching high point.
Closing the disc is the string
drenched "Annabella's Song,"
where, in a dedication to his daugh
ter, Alexakis and the band go a bit
too far; his rough voice just doesn't
sound right with the syrupy orches
tration. But, of course, if they take
chances, every once in a while failure

occurs, and this one isn't too much of
an embarrassment, just a hit odd at
points.
The only other complaint I'd
have is that the album is a hit tiring,
but Everclear's other albums also
have this quality. Of these albums,
Learning to Smile is arguably the
best so far, honing Alexakis' lyrical
imagery and story-telling ability as
well as the band's musical breadth
within their signature sound.
This more album-oriented, less
hook-oriented approach — along
with the awkward title — may scare

off long-time fans, and it makes re
peated listenings a must. Promised
in a few months is Vol. Two, which,
due to its harder edge, will likely
conform better to today's monoto
nous rock market. But Learning to
Smile, out now, is a gem.
