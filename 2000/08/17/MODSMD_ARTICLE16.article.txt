# 'Sonic Jihad' proves rock is still alive
## 
### WILL TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Third Eye Blind is one of my
least favorite groups. Ever. There
are at least 400 things I'd much
rather do than listen to them,
many of them involving sharp
pointy objects. So when my editor
gave me the new Snake River Con
spiracy CI), Sonic Jihad, and I dis
covered on the Web that one of the
founding members of Third Eye
Blind started this group, I was
contemplating hari kari to avoid
listening to it. It was shuffled to the
bottom of my to-do list, below the
do-it-yourself lobotomy.
I am glad that I chose to skip
the lobotomy because Snake River
Conspiracy definitely has more to
it than a fairly cool band name.
Sounding like a gestalt of Shirley
Manson and I'oe (whatever hap
pened to Poe, anyway? ()ne track
on the "Great Expectations"
soundtrack and she vanished),
lead singer Tobey Torres and her
musical henchman Jason Slater
(originally ofThird Eye Blind) cre
ate a number of tracks on their
new album that remind one of
what rock can be when the pop el
ements are removed. And what re
mains, the album— Sonic Jihad, is
pretty sweet indeed.
"Breed" is a nice start to the
album, though it is going to in
evitably draw comparisons to
Garbage. This isn't a bad thing, as
that group is essentially one of the
few to combine pop sensibility with
any type of edge or seductive qual
ity. Torres sounds more often

than not like a caged tiger, looking
at the people on the outside with
malevolent intent. The choruses
suggest what might happen if she
escapes, but it gets better later.
"Casualty" is a song that might
be called a ballad if it wasn't so
overproduced. That would be the
one major gripe 1 have with the
recordings — Slater's tendency to
do everything at once, either to
cover for weaknesses in Torres'
voice {a mistake on his part) or an
attempt to produce better than
Butch Vig of Garbage (which
would be a bigger mistake). Keep
ing it minimalist can actually be a
good thing sometimes, but Slater
sometimes treats his board like a
new toy and is looking to play with
all the bells and whistles. He will
hopefully only get better with
time, as he is definitely a talented
young man.
"Lovesong" covers a song by
The Cure (Is it required that all
new rock bands cover The Cure at
some point in their lives?). Again,
Torres" voice is fun to follow, but
Slater's production values get in
the way. We know lie's good and
he knows lie's good, but he tries
too hard to get away from "Semi-
Charmed Life." The CI) lags when
he takes these impresario turns be
hind the table, but some indul
gence is to be expected in one's
debut.
"Oh Well" picks the pace back
up a bit by allowing Torres to
romp a little more. The music
complements, not fights, her, and
it is on tracks like these that the duo
truly clicks.

The last four tracks of the
album, in fact, should be enough
to pick up the ears of the rest of the
world, especially if released as an
EP. Torres gets out on "Somebody
Hates You" and when she suggests
that "You're no one 'til somebody
bates you," it seems far more ratio
nal that it should. The tigress is re
ally let loose on the song "Vulcan,"
which is probably one of the best
songs you will never hear on the
radio. The song really needs to be
heard to be believed. You'll gain a
view of the word you haven't had
in awhile. Not many songs in re
cent memory start with a scream of
such pure malice.
Snake River Conspiracy is a
band in its infancy. The album
should catch the attentions of
more than a few people. It defi
nitely has its own indulgences by
both members, and in this day and
age that can be forgiven as long as
they can produce more screamers
like "Vulcan" (the video is avail
able on the CI) as well, and it's
worth it).
The group wants to rock, and
that's all right with me. It's what
Alanis used to do before she got
spiritual, and it's what we need
until more people start listening to
Sleater-Kinney.
