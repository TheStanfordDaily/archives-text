# Britney Spears provides manufactured fun for fans

The scene at the Shoreline Am
phitheatre on Aug. 8: an ocean of
glow sticks — not cigarette lighters
as the evening's master of cere
monies repeatedjy discouraged —
peppered by the occasional beach
ball being tossed around. A regular
family event! It could have been
Raffi playing, but the cotton candy
hawkers juxtaposed with the abun
dance of preteen midriff indicated
that this was a Britney Spears show.
Now Britney's taken up the cause
of ever elusive pop longevity, and
she didn't once let you forget it.
From the barrage of corporate
sponsors to her pathetic opening
acts, which served only to make her
look that much better onstage, the
family picnic event was a celebration
of Britney, Britney, Britney.
Her performance certainly indi
cated her tenacity to the stardom
that she has finally achieved. The
pyrotechnics were dazzling, the cos
tumes plentiful (and tummy-baring
to boot), the set changes dramatic
and then of course there was the oc
casional fusion of her costume with
the set (two numbers called for

getups that descended down the
length of the set's staircase).
It was pure glam, reminiscent of
the 1980s (Debbie Gibson, any
one?). The dancing was flawless and
so was the singing, given the sup
port lent by prerecorded tracks. She
even had some moms grooving to
her funky beats. She charged
through some 13 songs, closing with
crowd favorites "Baby One More
fime" and the übiquitous "Oops! 1
Did It Again."
But between all the Bling Bling
and the overwrought thank yous for
"making all this possible," the fun
never once managed to outweigh
the pop tart-ness of the entire affair.
The glamorous costumes, the un
mistakable-yet-oft-denied vibe of
sexuality (she straddled a pole,
deigned to dance without a bra and
allowed a glimpse of what's under
that school-girl skirt) — the only
thing missing was substance.
Billy Corgan of the Smashing
Pumpkins says that kids have heard
about the myth of rock and roll but
that they just haven't experienced it
vet. Britney proves that she can cer
tainly set the bar high for perform
ing. Somebody just needs to follow
through and deliver.
