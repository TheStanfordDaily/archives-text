# Unified Theory not quite together

### WILL TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It sounds like some sort of joke:
What do you get when you take
what's left of Blind Melon, add the
original drummer for Pearl Jam and
a dreadlocked singer-guitarist? The
result is Unified Theory, a band that
almost makes up in musicality what
it lacks in song writing ability. But al
most is an important word here, as it
can make the difference between a
band turning into something big
and fading into obscurity.
Blind Melon was a lucky group.
It's self-titled debut album sold like
gangbusters, going triple platinum
during a time when it seemed the
country couldn't get enough of
long-haired singer songwriters who
went around barefoot. Their success
was typical for a group at the time,
culminating in a performance at
Woodstock '94, at which lead singer
Shannon I loon wore his girlfriend's
clothing and threw conga drums
into the crowd. The second album
came out when the popularity of
such groups was starting to wane,
however, and people were far less

forgiving of musical inadequacies. It
only sold 217,000 copies when it de
buted in 1995, and Hoon died of a
drug overdose later that same year.
The band members went their
separate ways after the release of
Nico, a posthumous collection
named after Hoon's daughter. Two
members, Christopher Thorn and
Brad Smith, spent time searching
for "something to believe in" follow
ing the loss of their friend and be
lieved they found it in Chris Shinn.
frontman for a band called Celia
Green at die time Smith discovered
him.
The eventual result was Unified
Theory (though the group released
an EP in 1999 under the name
Luma). The sound of the group can
best be described as music in search
ofa direction. It's definitely not from
lack of trying. Lead vocalist Shinn
can't seem to decide if he wants to be
Rob Thomas or himself, and when
he makes up his mind he may turn
out to be something better than
merely competent. As it stands now,
he seems to be merely along for the
ride on most tracks.
The best thing about the album is

the music behind the voice. Thorn
and Smith are an excellent musical
team, and their ability to lace a track
together is showcased several times
on the album. The first track, "Cess
na," is well played and one of the bet
ter efforts on the disc. The music
swoops and dives around, and
Shinn trails along with it. It is also
somewhat telling that this was one of
the times that existed with the band
before Shinn appeared. Thorn and
Smith take turns on guitar; playfully
extolling their own virtues and mak
ing Shinn rise to the occasion.
This is followed by "Califor
nia," the first single released from
the album. It is definitely made for
radio, and that isn't necessarily a
bad thing. But in the case of this
song it seems like a retread: old
ground that has been well trav
eled already.
The best songs on the album
don't occur until the very end.
"Not Dead" and "Keep On" are
incredibly haunting tracks that
truly show what the musicians are
capable of, and Shinn takes him
self to another level in order to
support the song. "Keep On" is

one of the better-arranged tracks I
have heard all year, as the piano
accompaniment is a surprising
but welcome bluesy touch.
Unified Theory may eventually
put behind it the specter of Blind
Melon and Shannon Hoon. With
a little fine-tuning, it can all come

together. The music is already
there, and the song writing can
eventually even out. But the vo
cals on nine of the 12 tracks are
uninspired at best and pitiful at
worst. When that gets fixed, the
band will be something worth the
orizing about.
