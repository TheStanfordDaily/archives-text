## University restricts access to Dish 
### DENNIS TYLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Starting Sept. 1, clogs and picnickers will no longer find
refuge in the Stanford Foothills. For them, the Dish will of
ficially be off-limits.
As a part of its Conservation and Use Flan, the Univer
sity has placed restrictions on the Stanford community re
garding the recreational use of the hills. One of the most
controversial restrictions will ban dogs from the area.
The plan, announced by University President Gerhard
Casper on May 2 of this year, was created to restore and
maintain the visual splendor of the Foothills. The plan, a
long-term habitat conservation effort, would focus on en
vironmental restoration while restricting students, faculty
and staff only to authorized areas of the hills.
"Increased use of this area by the public for recreation
al hiking and jogging off paved service roads has, over
time, despoiled the environment and caused erosion of
the hillsides," said Casper. "This not only has impaired the
visual beauty of the area, it has threatened the habitat of
many sensitive native species. The wildlife habitat has
been further degraded by unleashed dogs."
The area has been closed since Aug. 14 and will not re
open to the public until Sept. 1, when the new rules and
regulations will be enforced.
According to the May 2 statement issued by Casper, the
new rules will include limiting recreational activities. Hik
ing and jogging will be permitted only on clearly delineat
ed routes on existing service roads. Picnics, games and so
cial events will not be permitted. No dogs will be permit
ted. This, according to the statement, conforms to the gen
eral practice of excluding dogs from areas designated for
biological conservation. Recreational access will be per
mitted from dawn until half an hour before sunset.
If overuse of the area or misuse of the recreational priv
ileges occurs, access rules may be reconsidered.
As a result of these new restrictions, the University has
received complaints from a number of different groups.
Hikers and runners, who routinely go to the Dish, enjoy
ing the peaceful ambiance, are angered with the Universi
ty's decision to confine them to a four-mile paved loop.
But no one has proven more furious than dog owners.
"Stanford's dog ban at the Dish Foothills does not make

sense," said Nice Dogs Outside (NI)O) supporter Linda
Cohn. "Inconsistency exists when you compare their rea
sons to open space areas that successfully do allow dogs.
Not to mention the new conservation zone is only 450 of
the 1,000 plus foothill acres. Upon review of the, Califor
nia/Stanford conservation agreement, which does not say
dogs should be excluded, their motives appear puzzling."
"They are really striking at the heart of what their
neighbors treasure the most," said NDO press spokesper
son Ginger Holt to the San Jose Mercury News.
The newly formed organization Nice Dogs Outside
(NDO) opposes Stanford's dog ban. In an effort to find an
acceptable compromise, NDO has presented ;i proposal to
Stanford asking them to ban only unleashed clogs from the
area. If Stanford were to accept this proposal, dog owners
would agree to keep their dogs on a leash, clean up after
them and sponsor regular clean-up days.
To further change the minds of University officials, dog
owners staged a 'howl-in' on Saturday to protest the Uni
versity's decision to ban dogs from the area.
But all to no avail.
According to Director of Community Relations Andy
Coe, Stanford intends to stick with their original plan to
ban all dogs from the area despite the proposal from their
opponents.
"We are going to implement the policy that we intro
duced on May 2. We are attempting to strike a balance be
tween habitat conservation, environmental restoration
and recreational use. The best way to do that is to ban all
dogs from the area," said Coe.
Many opponents believe that the clog ban is just anoth
er way for Stanford to start building in the Foothill area.
Suspicions became stronger in June when Stanford re
leased a 10-year development plan that will redesignate
154 acres in the Foothills from open space to academic
campus.
'Fhe Foothills were originally designated as an Academ
ic Reserve and Open Space. The new designation for the
area, according to Santa Clara County, will be Open Space
and Field Research.
When asked if there were any plans to build in the
Foothill area, Coe stated that there would be no construc
tion any time soon.
"We are not proposing any construction until at least

another 10 years because of our new development plan.
Even then, we are very limited by zoning laws, and if there
is any building it will be only small buildings," said Coe.
Regardless of the dog ban. University officials maintain
that they recognize the recreational value of the Dish area
and will attempt to accommodate Stanford faculty, stall
and students, as well as nearby neighbors and friends.
But it should not be forgotten, said Coe that, " The first
priority of all Stanford land is for the academic use of the
University."
As for now, the Dish remains completely closed until
Sept. 1 while construction projects are completed. The
University is repairing the existing fence around Old Page
Mill Road, installing a new fence around the Dish and
repaving the four-mile road area for recreational routes.
Whether or not hikers will appreciate the new up
grades remains to be seen. What is certain, is that, for some
hikers, any appreciation of the new routes will be drained
away by the more prominent frustration of having to leave
their canine companions at home.
