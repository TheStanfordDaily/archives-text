H. Donald Winbigler, who spent nearly
60 years serving the Stanford community in
positions ranging from profi-ssor of speech
and drama to clean of students, died of can
cer earlier this month. One of the most en
during figures to grace the Stanford campus,
Winbigler was 91 years old at the time of his
death on Aug. 5 in Bothell, Wash.
Though hired in 1940 as an assistant pro
fessor and eventually earning a full profes
sorship in 1949, Winbigler spent most of his
Stanford career as an administrator, starting
with his 1945 appointment as registrar. He
held that position until he was named dean of
students in 1950. From that position, Dean
Winbigler had a unique vantage point from
which to view Stanford's tremendous post-
World War II growth.
"Stanford had a reputation, deserved or
undeserved, ofbeing a kind of country club,"

Winbigler once said. But the face of the
University changed as soldiers return
ing from World War 11 doubled enroll
ment and increased the student body to
approximately 5,000.
The price of this inflation jvas not lost on
Winbigler, who remarked that "When you
double in size, you forfeit something in terms
of intimacy," though Winbigler did feel that
the early Cold War era changes were, in total,
very positive. The rapid addition of new fac
ulty and staff was seen as revitalizing the Uni
versity's academic center.
Fred Glover, a former colleague, paid
tribute to Winbigler in 1992.
"Winbigler met the demands of deanship
with boundless sympathy, good humor and
unflappable composure. His nerves stood
the test of panty raids, student pranks, a strip
teaser who almost won the presidency of the
student body, skirmishes with fraternities
and other living groups and with the Chap
arral."

Winbigler suspended the Chappie in
1961 and Brad Efron, its editor, for four
mont hs after he published a Playboy parody.
After sparking a campus-wide debate on cen
sorship, the situation resolved with some
irony as Efron went on to become an assistant
professor of statistics at Stanford five years
later. In fact, Efron recently chaired the Fac
ulty Senate during the 1998-99 academic
year.
Winbigler's name can also be found
among the documents related to the 1958
disappearance of the Axe. The Axe went
missing for live months and Dean Winbigler,
along with ASSU president Don Lozabnick,
UC- Berkeley's dean of students Hurtbrd E.
Stone and Ralph Vetterlein, president of the
Associated Students of University of Califor
nia, produced a "Big Game Non-Aggression
Pact" in the interim.
