# Clinton addresses the DNC in L.A

### JEFF TAM 
Tonight, Al Gore walks out of
the shadows for the first time.
For eight years, Gore has sat du
tifully behind President Bill
Clinton, defending him, watch
ing him â€” waiting for his turn.
When he strolls onto center
stage at the Democratic Nation
al Convention in Los Angeles,
he will get a chance to tell Amer
ica who he is and what he be
lieves in for the first time as his
own man.
But on Monday, it was Clin
ton's last time in front of the
stage and the cameras, with the
eyes of America watching him.
For the Stanford students and
faculty at the event in Los Ange
les, including History Prof.

David Kennedy and former
Stanford ASSU Undergraduate
Senate chair Steven Aronowitz,
as well as for all the other Stan
lord students and faculty watch
ing on television, this was to be a
fitting finale.
Clinton spent much of. his
time defending his record as
president, citing the passage of
the Family Leave Act, record-low
crime and, of course, the decade
long economic boom.
On the economic boom, Clin
ton said, "To those who say the
progress of the last eight years
was an accident, that we coasted

along, let's be clear: America's
success was not a matter of
chance, it was a matter of
choice."
Using the same friendly tone
of voice that Americans have
grown accustomed to, he spoke
of the need for a Democratic ma
jority in Congress and conveyed
his conviction that Al Gore is the
right man for the presidency.
Did his speech have its intend
ed effect in helping convince vot
ers that Al Gore will continue
America's economic prosperity
and yet set his own course?
Vijay Rao, senior in biology
and history, said that "He gave Al
Gore the necessary push for peo
ple to vote for him," but added
that he was going to vote for
Gore anvwav.

Jefferson Eppler, a junior ma
joring in economics, found that
while the speech was "one of the
better oratories" of his career, it
was basically a "valedictory for
his administration" and only
"very subtlety plugged Al Gore
in."
Martin Anderson, a senior
fellow at the Hoover Institution
who helped draft the Republi
can Party platform, said that
while the Clinton speech "set
up what Al Gore wants to talk
about," Gore's true vision re
mains a mystery. For instance,
according to Anderson, Bush's

plans for tax relief are current
ly very concrete, while Gore's
lack specifics.
And Anderson reacted to
some of Clinton's self-noted
achievements as well. On Clin
ton's record of reducing the dig
ital divide, an important issue
here in the heart of Silicon Val
ley, Anderson noted that there
was an enormous amount that
the President said, "but that little
was done."
Political Science Assoc. Prof.
Luis Fraga, who four years ago
engaged Anderson in a public
debate in Castano about the na
tional election, stated that while
the President's programs to re
duce the digital divide have not
been very significant, "He has
used his capacity to set a national

agenda to focus on technological
change, including looking at dis
parities in wealth."
Toward the end of his
speech Monday night, Clinton
said that "Today America faces
another choice, every bit as mo
mentous as the one eight years
ago. For what a nation does
with good fortune is just as
stern a test of its character, val
ues, and vision as how it deals
with adversity."
Tonight we should see some
insight in to how, if elected, Gore
would use the country's prosper
ity. Stanford will be watching.
