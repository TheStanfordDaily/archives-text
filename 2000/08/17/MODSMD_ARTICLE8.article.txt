## DAILY VIEWPOINT Mr. Robber meets Ms. Brown 
### 
Dear Mr. Thief who stole my bag
this weekend,
I just thought you and I should
get better acquainted. I mean, I al
ready know a lot about you: you're
mean, dishonest, awful, disgusting,
most likely dumb and ugly, and I
hate you. So since I know you so
well, 1 thought I'd help you learn
about me. Let's see: you have lots of
visual aids currently in your posses
sion ... you can follow along as I
talk!
So, let's start with the fact that I
like to swim ... you know this be
cause you stole my purse right out of
my friend Katie's car, which hap
pened to be parked in the halt
empty parking lot of her sleepy
neighborhood's pool! Cool, huh?!
Okay, then there's the fact that I
don't live in Massachusetts, where I
was while visiting Katie. But 1 bet
you knew that too because of the
USAir plane ticket from Boston to
Washington that was in my bag!!!
Moving on to my big file-o-fax
which serves as my planner, my ad
dress b(X)k and my wallet: wow, this
is a biggie, chock full of neat facts
about the girl who's life you have
"inconvenienced." Let's see, where
to begin: you know how beautiful I
am from the lovely, non-grainy pic
ture on my driver's license, (just
take awav the closed eves, matted

hair, awkward double chins, half
asleep / dead expression on my face
... hot, aren't I?)
You might be excited to have not
only my but also my parent's Visa
card. But not so fast! I canceled
those puppies... and it only took
51 minutes of conversation with the
brain-dead "customer service
agent," who succeeded in getting in
not one, but TWO lectures about
leaving valuables in cars! Okay, so
then there's my Tenley Sport and
Health card, so you know how good
I am at falling off treadmills. (That
card might be a little dusty.)
Okay, then you know I like
movies, 'cause of the Blockbuster
card. (I hope you're pleasantly sur
prised by the $ 17 late fee currently
chilling on it.) Also, I really like to eat
... hence the Safeway club card.
You know 1 go to Stanford too —
you now have my ID card. You can
get into an)' library on campus!
You're psyched to now have ac
cess to all my friends and family
members ... not a phone number
or carefully recorded birthday miss
ing! So if you don't feel you've in
vaded my privacy by stealing all my
worldly possessions, you can always
call my high school roommate Beth
or my Aunt Annie and get some
juicy details. (And be sure to call my
grandma next week to say happy

birthday — I'm not quite sure what
specific date it is, but you can find
out!)
()kay, so via my keys you also now
have access to my house, a couple of
cars, my Stanford P.O. Box, my bike
and a couple of my friends' houses.
Just think how much more of my
stuff you can steal now! You can
choose between my mom's old
Volvo station wagon (currently
parked in Mirrielees ... answers to
the name "the Silver Bullet") or my
mom's new car, a Jeep Cherokee
that gets a whopping three miles to
the gallon. Such choices!
And want anything in my house?
Any of ni)' pets? /Ml yours! And as a
bonus, you also now own one of my
most prized possessions: an Alice
97.3 bright pink flower key chain.
Treat it with love, and don't allow
your rabbit to chew off any more of
the petals, like I allowed mine to do.
You know I have poor distance
eyesight because you have my glass
es. You're lucky ... you'll be able to
see, read things and drive. Whatev
er, it's not like I need my glasses that
badly. 1 really do enjoy sitting six
inches from the TV, pulling my
chair up so close to the computer
that the edge of the desk comes close
to severing my body in half and call
ing out to people on the street,
thinking they're friends, only to get

closer and realize 1 was just waving
to a trash can.
Let's see... other fragments of
my now completely naked life that
you can find in that bag... check
book: yours. Clinique "guava stain"
lipstick: yours. Pink plastic brush:
yours. Altoids: yours. Really, what
more could you ask for? Money,
silky hair and fresh breath!
So, Mr. Robber, I hope that
you're enjoying those little bits of my
life as much as I did. 1 thought of you
as I spent Saturday afternoon filing
police reports at the Worcester Po
lice Department. I thought of you as
I tried to claim my reservation on
my flight home despite the fact that
I had no photo ID, no credit card
and no ticket.
And I will think of you as I stand

in line at the Washington Depart
ment of Motor Vehicles, waiting for
17 hours to get my driver's license
replaced. I'll think of you as I stand
in line waiting to get copies of all the
keys 1 need. I'll think of you when
my father gives me his 91st lecture
about "responsibility."
And most of all, when I think of
people I hate and wish would find
themselves struck down by a severe
case of chlamydia, you will be lore
most in my mind.
Sincerely,
Alice Brown

agent," who succeeded in getting in
not one, but TWO lectures about
leaving valuables in cars! Okay, so
then there's my Tenley Sport and
Health card, so you know how good
I am at falling off treadmills. (That
card might be a little dusty.)
Okay, then you know I like
movies, 'cause of the Blockbuster
card. (I hope you're pleasantly sur
prised by the $ 17 late fee currently
chilling on it.) Also, I really like to eat
... hence the Safeway club card.
You know 1 go to Stanford too —
you now have my ID card. You can
get into an)' library on campus!
You're psyched to now have ac
cess to all my friends and family
members ... not a phone number
or carefully recorded birthday miss
ing! So if you don't feel you've in
vaded my privacy by stealing all my
worldly possessions, you can always
call my high school roommate Beth
or my Aunt Annie and get some
juicy details. (And be sure to call my
grandma next week to say happy

birthday — I'm not quite sure what
specific date it is, but you can find
out!)
()kay, so via my keys you also now
have access to my house, a couple of
cars, my Stanford P.O. Box, my bike
and a couple of my friends' houses.
Just think how much more of my
stuff you can steal now! You can
choose between my mom's old
Volvo station wagon (currently
parked in Mirrielees ... answers to
the name "the Silver Bullet") or my
mom's new car, a Jeep Cherokee
that gets a whopping three miles to
the gallon. Such choices!
And want anything in my house?
Any of ni)' pets? /Ml yours! And as a
bonus, you also now own one of my
most prized possessions: an Alice
97.3 bright pink flower key chain.
Treat it with love, and don't allow
your rabbit to chew off any more of
the petals, like I allowed mine to do.
You know I have poor distance
eyesight because you have my glass
es. You're lucky ... you'll be able to
see, read things and drive. Whatev
er, it's not like I need my glasses that
badly. 1 really do enjoy sitting six
inches from the TV, pulling my
chair up so close to the computer
that the edge of the desk comes close
to severing my body in half and call
ing out to people on the street,
thinking they're friends, only to get

closer and realize 1 was just waving
to a trash can.
Let's see... other fragments of
my now completely naked life that
you can find in that bag... check
book: yours. Clinique "guava stain"
lipstick: yours. Pink plastic brush:
yours. Altoids: yours. Really, what
more could you ask for? Money,
silky hair and fresh breath!
So, Mr. Robber, I hope that
you're enjoying those little bits of my
life as much as I did. 1 thought of you
as I spent Saturday afternoon filing
police reports at the Worcester Po
lice Department. I thought of you as
I tried to claim my reservation on
my flight home despite the fact that
I had no photo ID, no credit card
and no ticket.
And I will think of you as I stand

in line at the Washington Depart
ment of Motor Vehicles, waiting for
17 hours to get my driver's license
replaced. I'll think of you as I stand
in line waiting to get copies of all the
keys 1 need. I'll think of you when
my father gives me his 91st lecture
about "responsibility."
And most of all, when I think of
people I hate and wish would find
themselves struck down by a severe
case of chlamydia, you will be lore
most in my mind.
Sincerely,
Alice Brown
