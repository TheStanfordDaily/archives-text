## Hypocrisy at Stanford's gate 
### 
The other day at the entrance to
the Dish area, a two-minute walk
from my campus home, I was ap
proached by an aggressive young
woman who asked me to sign her
petition. When I declined, she asked
me, clearly annoyed, "Do you prefer
to walk on asphalt?"
This woman represented SOSA,
the Stanford Open Space Alliance.
Actually, SOSA could stand for
"(Anti)Stanford ()rgani/ed
Selfishness Association." SOSA's
avowed aim is "permanent protec
tion of Stanford's undeveloped
lands in the foothills," (SJ Mercury
News, Aug. 13).
But if they cared the slightest bit
about this, they would long ago have
demanded that Stanford lock the
gates to stop the grotesque, uncon
trolled overuse that has come close
to destroying the area. Instead,
S( )SA has watched approvingly as
bootleg trails have grown into ugly,
unruly unpaved roadways and the

hills have gone to the dogs. What
"protection?"
If these so-called environmental
ists had taken Ecology 101, they
would have learned about Garrett
Hardin's classic 1968 paper "The
Tragedy of the Commons." The
commons is the English village field
shared by all and used for grazing
catde. As each villager tries to gain
an advantage by adding one more
cow, he does not consider the slight
overusage of available grass that af
fects everyone else's cattle. Eventual
ly the production from the com
mons collapses as each person's
small self-servingextra usage ruins it
for everyone.
If the S( )NA folks had taken Eco
nomics 101, they would have
learned about the "free rider phe
nomenon." They boast of the num
ber of people who have signed their
petition, but why should any user of
the Foothills not sign? Where is the
incentive not to use someone else's
property without any restriction,
cost, obligation or responsibility?

Such a deal!
Why should 1 slay on Stanford's
freely offered four miles of paved
patiis it I can continue to wander
anywhere 1 want, environment and
wildlife be damned? Why should 1
not continue to get a free ride for
myself and a good run lor my dogs?
(Yes. 1 know — "MY dogs are nice.
It's all those other people.") The an
swer, of course, is the same if every
one demands the benefits and no
body is willing to pay even as small a
price as obeying a few simple rules,
then everyone ends up a loser, liy its
relentless, uncompromising hostili
ty to Stanford, S( )SA has gone a long
way to undermine the very public
interest that it pretends to support.
The last I heard the group
claimed 10,000 signatures on their
petition. Ix't's accept that number
and make a lew very modest as
sumptions. First, assume that those
10K signatures were collected at the
main gate and the signers entered
the property. Second, some people
like me did not sign — guess at 10

percent. Third, some people en
tered the property at other gates,
another 20 percent. Fourth, some
people entered on weekdays when
tlx 1 card table was not in place, an
other 25 percent. Fifth, most people
signed once but came multiple times
over the sixth months or so that sig
natures were collected — say just
four times (many people visited the
area weekly or even daily).
Very conservatively, that sounds
like roughly 10,000 uncontrolled
entries per month — perhaps 20
percent accompanied by dogs. This
on undeveloped private property,
with tlit' active encouragement of
SOSA. What "protection?"
Stanford is not without blame in
this situation. Years ago, after seeing
the fence ;it the intersection of Stan
ford Avenue and Junipero Serra
Boulevard repeatedly vandalized by
people who trespassed on their
property, the I niversity capitulated
and installed the current entrance.
Then, like Rip Van Winkle, it went
to sleep for 20 years while the popu

larity of the Dish soared and its envi
ronmental quality plunged. When
Stanford finally woke up this year,
SOSA was (literally) at its gates, clam
oring to add insult to injury.
The Foothills are not a park.
They were never developed or in
tended as a park, and this is pre
sumably the way everyone wants
them. But while people cherish the
illusion of a pristine natural environ
ment, they demand the freedom to
use it any way they damn well please.
Now that Stanford has belatedly
come to its senses and, at great ex
pense to itself, is introducing some
reasonable regulations to establish
a protected environment usable by
everyone, the so-called environ
mentalists howl in protest. This re
action is understandable because
SOSA's underlying game plan is
not protection of Stanford's lands,
but control over Stanford's devel
opment and building — a pure
power play.
