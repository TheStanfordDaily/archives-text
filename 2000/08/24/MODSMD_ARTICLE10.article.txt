# Fourth Astrobiology Academy ends

### VICTORIA DAVIS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Today and tomorrow, I!i members of the
2000 graduating < hiss of the NASA Astrobiologv
Academy will be presenting the results of their
summer research to an audience of their peers.
NASA researchers and administrators.
The NASA Astrobiologv Academy is an in
tense 10-week summer program, housed at
Stanlord, whose purpose is to guide future lead
ers of the I S. Space Program by exposing them
to the inner workings of NASA. During this sum
mer's session. c<)llege-age students were involved
in research projects in topics ranging from the
organics in interstellar dust grains to oxidative
damage and its effects 011 microbial life.
The main goal of the Astrobiology Academy is
to introduce some of the best and brightest stu
dents to NASA in hopes that in the future they
will pursue careers within the various aspects ol
aerospace, most specifically, astrobiology.
"Hopefully the program will further influ
ence students interested in astrobiology
Some day they may be the 112 uture leaders here â€”
expanding the astrobiology 112 rontier," said Acad
emy Director Dr. Douglas O'Handley.
The students have been exposed to a vast
amount of information over the past 10 weeks
that they will take away with them. Natacha
Chough, a molecular and cell biology major at
the University of Washington in Seattle, has ab
solutely loved her experience in the academy
and appreciates all that she has learned.
"I'm walking away with a profound under
standing of the implications of astrobiologv - . The
information we get is overwhelming. I think
someone likened it to drinking water from a fire
hose," Chough remarked.
The program has been continuously evolv
ing. This year's graduating class has a grade
point average of 3.75. The GPA has clearly risen

in comparison to previous years. ()'Handlev feels
that the selection proc ess has become more effi
cient with regard to meeting the goals of the
academy.
"in the past, 1 have to admit thai ue had quite
a few eggheads. Not that there's a problem with
that, but we are really looking for students who
show clear evidence of leadership abilitystated
O'Handley, who feels that the academy's stu
dents are some of the best in the nation. " I he\ all
have very strong academic records but have also
exhibited their leadership skills in various roles
such as being the captain of a soccer team to
being the president ofa pre-professional organi
zation," said ()'Handley.
The selection process however, is also a sub
jective one that is not entirely based on numbers
This year the academy saw students from five
new states: Hawaii, Illinois, Pennsylvania,
Arkansas and Florida. The academy expects to
drop New York next year, as the state has had a
candidate every y ear since the academy s first ses
sion four years ago. The current class has 1S stu
dents from 13 different states. In the near future
however, the academy may expand to become
an international academy.

The Astrobiology Academy graduates this week
During this summer's session, stu
dents each spent approximately 50
percent of their time at NASA Ames
Research Center at Moflet Field con
ducting independent research pro
jects under the direction of their as
signed principal investigator (PI).
The other half of their intense sum
mer experience was spent on other
intellectually enriching activities such
as attending a lecture series present
ed by NASA's top scientists that fo
cused on the various aspects of astro
biology. Students also went on sever
al trips to other aerospace research
centers on the west coast such as the
Jet Propulsion Laboratories, the
Desert Research Institute in Nevada
and Lawrence Livermore Laborato

ries, to name a few.
This year's class of 13 has grown
into a very close group. Not only did
they live in close quarters with each
other at Stanford's Phi Sig House,
but they also had their share of fun
river rafting, going hiking at
Vosemite and much more.
"The academy has now evolved
to a specific size," commented
()'Handley. Previous academies had
included up to 15 students. "Fifteen
students is too many. A smaller
group of 13 encourages more bond
ing and teamwork, which is one of
our goals ... plus they can all lit in a
single vehicle."
On Saturday, Phi Sig will say
goodbye to the 13 graduates of the
2000 NASA Astrobiology Academy.
Stanford has housed academy stu
dents at Phi Sig every year. Although
this year's academy is now coming to
a close, it may not be the last time the

students grace Stanford with their
presence. Over half of the past grad
uates have applied and been accept
ed to graduate schools. Fifteen per
cent of them are now attending grad
uate school at Stanford.
The students of this year's acade
my have all enjoyed their time spent
in California and value all that thev
have learned. They stronglv recom
mend the academy to people who are
considering applying to it.
"It opens so manv doors for you;
people are getting job offers left and
right. I may have a job lined up after
graduation to work in Tokyo on the
space station. The Lockheed man
agers came to the Academy first to re
cruit, so 1 definitely feel it's worth it to
be in the Academy," stated Chough.
"Plus, we all have 12 of the closest
friends lhat we will be networking with
throughout our careers at NASA I
can't imagine anything better."
