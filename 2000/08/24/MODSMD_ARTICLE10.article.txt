### VICTORIA DAVIS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Today and tomorrow, I!i members of the
2000 graduating < hiss of the NASA Astrobiologv
Academy will be presenting the results of their
summer research to an audience of their peers.
NASA researchers and administrators.
The NASA Astrobiologv Academy is an in
tense 10-week summer program, housed at
Stanlord, whose purpose is to guide future lead
ers of the I S. Space Program by exposing them
to the inner workings of NASA. During this sum
mer's session. c<)llege-age students were involved
in research projects in topics ranging from the
organics in interstellar dust grains to oxidative
damage and its effects 011 microbial life.
The main goal of the Astrobiology Academy is
to introduce some of the best and brightest stu
dents to NASA in hopes that in the future they
will pursue careers within the various aspects ol
aerospace, most specifically, astrobiology.
"Hopefully the program will further influ
ence students interested in astrobiology
Some day they may be the 112 uture leaders here â€”
expanding the astrobiology 112 rontier," said Acad
emy Director Dr. Douglas O'Handley.
The students have been exposed to a vast
amount of information over the past 10 weeks
that they will take away with them. Natacha
Chough, a molecular and cell biology major at
the University of Washington in Seattle, has ab
solutely loved her experience in the academy
and appreciates all that she has learned.
"I'm walking away with a profound under
standing of the implications of astrobiologv - . The
information we get is overwhelming. I think
someone likened it to drinking water from a fire
hose," Chough remarked.
The program has been continuously evolv
ing. This year's graduating class has a grade
point average of 3.75. The GPA has clearly risen

in comparison to previous years. ()'Handlev feels
that the selection proc ess has become more effi
cient with regard to meeting the goals of the
academy.
"in the past, 1 have to admit thai ue had quite
a few eggheads. Not that there's a problem with
that, but we are really looking for students who
show clear evidence of leadership abilitystated
O'Handley, who feels that the academy's stu
dents are some of the best in the nation. " I he\ all
have very strong academic records but have also
exhibited their leadership skills in various roles
such as being the captain of a soccer team to
being the president ofa pre-professional organi
zation," said ()'Handley.
The selection process however, is also a sub
jective one that is not entirely based on numbers
This year the academy saw students from five
new states: Hawaii, Illinois, Pennsylvania,
Arkansas and Florida. The academy expects to
drop New York next year, as the state has had a
candidate every y ear since the academy s first ses
sion four years ago. The current class has 1S stu
dents from 13 different states. In the near future
however, the academy may expand to become
an international academy.
