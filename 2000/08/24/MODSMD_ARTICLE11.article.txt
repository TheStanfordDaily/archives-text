## DAILY VIEWPOINT Two wheels better than four 
### MEREDITH ROWE STAFF COLUMNIST 
When we were little, my younger
brother David and 1 shared every
thing: a bedroom with two identical
twin beds, lots of red spots during an
elementary school episode of chick
en pox and even our He-Man and
She-Ra action figures.
But now that we're IS and 20,
respectively, David and 1 have
found something that's just impos
sible to share: our car, a 1998
Mazda Protege.
We have no other choice but to
share the poor thing, as we're not al
lowed to borrow our parents' cars,
and the\ decided that having only
one car between the two of us would
teach us responsibility, respect and
other admirable virtues.
Well, sure, but just wait until
our little brother, Michael, turns 16
in February. Next summer, when
there's three of us all trying to
share the same car, should prove
interesting.
Meanwhile, David and 1 fight
over the Protege. He's a waiter at a
nearby Friday's restaurant, and I
work for a newspaper in Piano,
which is 20 minutes away. This
makes weekdays pretty interesting
since we're expected to "share" our

only source of transportation, and
especially since I'm a reporter,
which means 1 often have to go and,
you know, interview people.
Without too much bloodshed, we
managed to work out a schedule
that lets me have the car three days
of the week. On the other days, 1
have to depend on my mother to
drive me back and forth.
She's only forgotten me in Piano
twice. Leaving me sitting on the
steps outside the office building for
half an hour or more in 147-degree
heat, like a lost puppy, until she re
membered that it was Meredith
pick-up day.
1 guess I'm learning patience.
And on the days when 1 have the
car, David usually works nights, so
I'm expected to be home from any
frolicking with friends by 10 p.m. so
I can "take the car to Friday's."
Yes, at age 20, I have a 10 p.m.
curlew at least three days of the
week. Once I return home with said
automobile, one of my parents then
drives to the restaurant with me fol
lowing, and I have to leave my car in
the parking lot so David can have it
to drive when he gets off work. Can
someone please explain the logic of
this to me?
On the other four days of the
week (weekends included), I do

pretty much nothing because I have
no transportation. Gas is expensive,
and my friends have been driving
me around for the past five years, so
I think they're starting to decide my
company might not be worth their
credit card bills.
Mv friends and everyone else are
completely non-understanding
when it comes to my lack of mobility
(and mind you, there is no public
transportation here at all, ever).
Most of the time they collapse into
fits of laughter when 1 have to ask for
a ride home.
And one of my employers
thought it was pretty funny, too: the
first day of work I was dropped off at
the office doorstep by my mother.
When I entered the building, my
boss asked me, with a stern face,
"Meredith, can you drive?"
"Yes, 1.. .1 just can't drive al
ways," I stammered. I'm sure this
sounded really impressive and intel
ligent.
From then on, whenever my boss
would see me, she'd attempt to hide
a smile as she asked if it was "my day"
or "David's day."
And the other night, after cover
ing a Mc Kinney Gity Council meet
ing, I had to ask the reporter from
the rival newspaper for a ride home.
I'm learning humility.

Another problem with sharing a
car is the ensuing battle over interior
and exterior decorating. Personally,
I prefer clean and uncluttered.
Unfortunately, my brother's
tastes have always been a bit loud
and garish; he was one of those
sticky-fingered kids who really liked
colorful sparkly things. You know
the type. Kind of like a circus clown.
On my poor car's rear passenger
windows, there are two monstrous
sticker letter "Ms" (for McKinney
High School). Be proud, David says,
for these are the mark of a varsity
football player. Which is what I've al
ways wanted to be.
He also has been given a multi
tude of "gifts" by innumerable gig
gly teenage girlfriends, which trans
lates to approximately 4,637 stuffed
animals in the back seat of our car.
There's a 3-foot tall ostrich, 175

teddy bears and a wide variety of
lions. This is really tun to explain to
grocery store bag boys who help yon
out with your stuff.
And since David's a Friday's wait
er, he has a lot of "flare" he's sup
posed to wear every day to work. At
some point, lie decided a good place
to store all this junk would he the
car's front seat. Last 1 checked, we
were the proud owners of buttons
saying stuff like, "Kiss Me, I'm
Irish," one pair of red suspenders, a
Santa Claus hat, a graduation tassel
or two and more.
Well, if we ever take this car on a
road trip, at least we'll have lots of
entertainment.
Back to the car exterior. Besides
the scary "M" stickers, there's a huge
round Dave Matthews Band piece of
