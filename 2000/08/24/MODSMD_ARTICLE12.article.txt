## Life's lessons – A summer spent in Arkansas 
### BRIAN EULE GUEST COLUMNIST 
"They're not waving back," I tell him. "I
thought they always wave back."
Bret smiles. He's been here a year now
and, unlike me, grew up in a small town.
While I talk of my time in Los Angeles, Wash
ington D.C. and the Bay Area, he reminisces
about towns I have never heard of in lowa
and Nebraska.
We are in my Nissan with California
plates, leaving Jasper, Ark., population 532,
on an uneven two-lane road that the locals
call a highway.
I'm trying to wave to any other cars we see.
"You're doing it wrong," he says. "Don't
lift up your whole hand. They'll think you're
a goof ball. Keep your hand on the steering
wheel and extend one to two fingers straight
up, off the wheel."
"One to two fingers?" I ask. "Which is it?!"
Bret laughs at my panic.
"Some places down here do one finger,
others two," he says.
I try one.

A man in a red pickup passes and returns
the wave.
He uses two.
Nonetheless, it was a wave and that's good
enough for me, proud to have mastered an
other lesson from the south. I'm one of them
now. The two-finger wave is my affirmation.
We're about two hours east of Springdale,
Ark., where Bret works out of the Northwest
Bureau of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette,
and two and a half hours north of the Little
Rock Bureau where I have been working
during the past three months.
There have been several misconceptions
about my move here, and it seems only ap
propriate to clear them up at this time.
First, I did in fact choose to journey to
Arkansas by my own free will. Nobody
forced me to spend my summer soaking in
my own sweat, as temperatures fluctuate be
tween 101 and 104 degrees. Not to mention
the intense humidity. (It is here I am re
minded of every grandparent's favorite
seven-word phrase: "It's not the heat, it's
the humidity!")
Second, while I have done everything in

my power to become a true Arkansan, I have
not forgotten my California roots. Thus, in
stead of saying the popular phrase: "I'll be
there quicker than a duck on a junebug," I
say: "Dude, I'll be there quicker than a duck
on a junebug, dude."
Third, I do not live in a mobile home. I
mean a triple-wide. I mean a manufactured
home. (My apologies to Governor Huckabee
and his first lady.)
Fourth, and finally, while I have made
many, many attempts, I have still yet to suc
cessfully master "boot scootin'" country
dancing.
This aside, a summer in Arkansas pro
vides a steep learning curve for a city boy like
myself, who grew up in a household with one
rule in regards to where our family would
live. If you passed a cow from the house to
the airport, the location was out. Naturally,
when I grew independent, I decided to ex
pand my horizons to include cows.
Arkansas has done that and then some. It
has introduced me to the unique sensation of
waking up in the middle of the night to find
myself sitting upright in my bed, scratching

my legs intensely as the bug bites grow large.
It has introduced me to the famous "Wooo
Pig Sooie" cheer that is so near and dear to
the hearts of my fellow Arkansans, as well as
a popular state motto, "Thank God for Mis
sissippi." And it has introduced me to the
ever so politically correct question, "Who are
your people?"
But Arkansas has also taught me south
ern hospitality and the art of addressing
everyone as either "ma'am" or "sir." This
honestly makes a difference. Especially
when someone does it to me. Then, it's RE
ALLY cool.
Furthermore, it has taught me that the
ridiculous stereotype of associating a thick
southern accent with a lack of intelligence is
merely that — a ridiculous stereotype.
And ofcourse, Arkansas has taught me the
two-finger steering wheel wave.

Brian Eule, now a senior majoring in communi
cation, actually likes Arkansas, contrary to popular
belief. He welcomes all e-mails at beule@stan-
Jord.edu and promises to reply quicker than a duck
on a junebug, duds.
