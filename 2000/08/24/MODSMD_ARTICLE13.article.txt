# Cheer camps foster spirit

I was never exposed to cheerleaders as a
teenager; I attended an all girls private Catholic
school where athletes were an idolized, elite
clique. On Stanford's campus, Dollies do not
exactly occupy the coveted roles dramatized by
teen flic ks and mocked in the conversational
banter of "Dawson's Creek." In fact, "cheer
leader" does not necessarily equate "prom
princess," though the two are not mutually ex
clusive either.

Stern Hall's Kurbank dormitory hosted an elite

cheering squads took place this past week, Aug.
17 - 20, in Governor's Corner.

Regardless of what people say, cheerleaders
capture our attention; they hypnotize us with
their rhythmic clapping, synchronized forma

Cheerleading is a performance-based sport,
not unlike ice skating or synchronized swim
ming. Each year, an elite group of cheer teams
and songleading / pom squads compete, culmi
nating at ESPN Cheerleading nationals.
Chapparal High hires a choreographer for

the dance routines, and their trainer ensures
that the girls maintain a healthy diet and exer
cise program to build stamina and strength.
Iliey practice at least two hours daily after
school, and the choreographer teaches them

new moves three times a week. The time com

â€” equivalent to a part-time job for some.

High School sophomore Cheryl Yosowitz said. Chappar
al placed 13th in competition and did not get to go on to
nationals this past year. They participated in the USA elite
camp to gain an edge lor this year.
Spots on the teams are coveted due to a limited num
ber of available spaces; hundreds of girls tryout for four
teen spots. "It breaks my heart to have to tell a girl that she
did not make the team. The previous coach literally an
nounced during tryouts who made the team and who
didn't... not unlike a cat t a 11... so you have one group
of girls screaming and yelling and another crying," said
Coach Jill Milnor of the Silver Creek High Raiders cheer
squad.
A former Portland Trailblazer cheerleader, Milnor
concentrates on the teambuilding aspect ofcheerleading.
She remarked that many of her students face adult obsta
cles and challenges. Cheerleading is an after-school activ
ity that allows her students to forget their troubles and
enjoy themselves. Unlike the stereotype that depicts typi
cal cheerleaders as rich, white teenage girls sporting high
pony tails of blond curls, Silver Creek High has a diverse
squad that accurately reflects its East San Jose working
class community. "Ten percent of our school is white and
the rest of the school is predominantly black and Latino,"
Milnor commented.
"We don't 'rule' the school, as a lot of these films like
'Bring It ()n' portray," Yosowitz of ('.happaral remarked.
In fact, 1 discovered that many of the squads are ridiculed
by their home schools. In response, Milnor concentrates
on group activities that build self-esteem.
"Camp ac tivities begin at 7 a.m. and end at 9 p.m. I set
.i mandatory team meeting 15 minutes afterward, before
showers and phone calls home," Milnor said. She begins
the meetings by having members of her team comment
on the day. They reflect on how a fellow team member im
proved or made a difference. A squad <)f over 30 students,
including several teenage boys, Silver Creek High
Raiders exemplifies how cheerleading has evolved.
Many of the students are not only teammates but
friends as well. So these team-bonding sessions are not su
perficial but sincere; they are structured to not only raise
team morale but to address the spec ific emotional needs
of the teenagers.
"I'm starting Chapparal this fall as a senior, and I don't
really know anyone; my family moved here from North
Carolina. I joined the team to make friends and to be rec
ognized at school," Chapparal senior Blake Reeves
shared. Reeves gained the respect of her peers almost in
stantly; as an accomplished dancer who performs with a
professional dance company, she has already been of

fered a dance scholarship from the University of Arizona.
She made the all star team at the elite USA cheer camp.
Cheerleading extends to all types of teenagers, irrel
evant of race, class, gender or body tvpe. Perhaps the
most noted team for their difference was the squad from
the California School for the Deaf in Fremont, Calif.
This squad of five girls received "superior" blue ribbons
for stunting, and two of the five made the all star team.
Unlike their peers, the c heer squad from the Califor
nia School of the Deaf signs their cheers. "There is real
ly no difference between these girls and the hearing
squads, except that everything is silent," a translator for
the squad said. However, there is a lot of visual noise and
an exhausting amount of visual stimulation at silent
football games and other sporting events at the School
for the Deaf.
"We keep the right speed by watching out of the cor
ner of our eyes and memorizing the action of our hear
ing neighbors according to a scale of one to eight
counts," junior Renee Vaiora observed. Stunting was
their most successful event over the weekend. The girls
rely on eye contact to communicate while operating as
the base for their flyer, junior Roechelle Wolfert.
Stunting is a complicated element of cheerleading
that many of the hearing squads could not master. The
entire team of four required to successfully launch and
catapult the flyer in the ait must operate in unison. Even
the slightest mistake can cause crippling injuries. The
athleticism involved in stunting recruits male jocks who
can easily hurl female flyers into the air.
I was invited to participate in theTeamMaker Work
shop on the last day of camp. During this activity, the
girls gather in a circle and share with each other how the
camp affected them individually and as a team. They list
their goals for the upcoming season and offer each other
moral support. Tears were shed and hugs evenly dis
tributed. The Team Maker Workshop renewed group
solidarity by celebrating each member's role, whether
the Cheer Captain or the base of a stunt.
"The best part of USA camps is how squads grow to
gether," former Alameda High cheerleader Cina ("raft
observed. Her mother, the coach of the Alameda High
cheer squad, revealed, "My daughter Cina went to this
cheerleading camp live times during high school, and
this was the first year she could not participate. She had
tears in her eyes as she helped her sister pack for camp."
I left the field watching Cina Craft and her family
watch closing ceremonies. Armed with a wardrobe of
USA attire, I walked away somewhat nostalgic myself.

for stunting, and two of the five made the all star team.
Unlike their peers, the c heer squad from the Califor
nia School of the Deaf signs their cheers. "There is real
ly no difference between these girls and the hearing
squads, except that everything is silent," a translator for
the squad said. However, there is a lot of visual noise and
an exhausting amount of visual stimulation at silent
football games and other sporting events at the School
for the Deaf.
"We keep the right speed by watching out of the cor
ner of our eyes and memorizing the action of our hear
ing neighbors according to a scale of one to eight
counts," junior Renee Vaiora observed. Stunting was
their most successful event over the weekend. The girls
rely on eye contact to communicate while operating as
the base for their flyer, junior Roechelle Wolfert.
Stunting is a complicated element of cheerleading
that many of the hearing squads could not master. The
entire team of four required to successfully launch and
catapult the flyer in the ait must operate in unison. Even
the slightest mistake can cause crippling injuries. The
athleticism involved in stunting recruits male jocks who
can easily hurl female flyers into the air.
I was invited to participate in theTeamMaker Work
shop on the last day of camp. During this activity, the
girls gather in a circle and share with each other how the
camp affected them individually and as a team. They list
their goals for the upcoming season and offer each other
moral support. Tears were shed and hugs evenly dis
tributed. The Team Maker Workshop renewed group
solidarity by celebrating each member's role, whether
the Cheer Captain or the base of a stunt.
"The best part of USA camps is how squads grow to
gether," former Alameda High cheerleader Cina ("raft
observed. Her mother, the coach of the Alameda High
cheer squad, revealed, "My daughter Cina went to this
cheerleading camp live times during high school, and
this was the first year she could not participate. She had
tears in her eyes as she helped her sister pack for camp."
I left the field watching Cina Craft and her family
watch closing ceremonies. Armed with a wardrobe of
USA attire, I walked away somewhat nostalgic myself.

I was never exposed to cheerleaders as a
teenager; I attended an all girls private Catholic
school where athletes were an idolized, elite
clique. On Stanford's campus, Dollies do not
exactly occupy the coveted roles dramatized by
teen flic ks and mocked in the conversational
banter of "Dawson's Creek." In fact, "cheer
leader" does not necessarily equate "prom

clusive either.

cheering squads took place this past week, Aug.
17 - 20, in Governor's Corner.

School sophomore Terri Carter commented.

While cheering on Wilbur field, the girls

were heckled by not only teenage male pedes

shared courts with. Adolescent boys stood far
off the sidelines with a video camera taping the
girls' activities. Men shouted from the windows

practice. 1 witnessed how teasing damages their
confidence and, in turn, crushes team morale.
Carter and her peers continue to cheer be

Regardless of what people say, cheerleaders
capture our attention; they hypnotize us with
their rhythmic clapping, synchronized forma
tions and high flying stunts. In a youth-driven
culture branded pop, cheerleaders blend the
choreography of a scripted make-believe with
the unpredictability of real-time sports. By am
plifying our game-time emotion, cheerleaders
shape audience reaction.
Cheerleading is a performance-based sport,
not unlike ice skating or synchronized swim

and songleading / pom squads compete, culmi

High School sophomore Cheryl Yosowitz said. Chappar
al placed 13th in competition and did not get to go on to
nationals this past year. They participated in the USA elite
camp to gain an edge lor this year.
Spots on the teams are coveted due to a limited num
ber of available spaces; hundreds of girls tryout for four
teen spots. "It breaks my heart to have to tell a girl that she
did not make the team. The previous coach literally an
nounced during tryouts who made the team and who
didn't... not unlike a cat t a 11... so you have one group
of girls screaming and yelling and another crying," said
Coach Jill Milnor of the Silver Creek High Raiders cheer
squad.
A former Portland Trailblazer cheerleader, Milnor
concentrates on the teambuilding aspect ofcheerleading.
She remarked that many of her students face adult obsta
cles and challenges. Cheerleading is an after-school activ
ity that allows her students to forget their troubles and
enjoy themselves. Unlike the stereotype that depicts typi
cal cheerleaders as rich, white teenage girls sporting high
pony tails of blond curls, Silver Creek High has a diverse
squad that accurately reflects its East San Jose working
class community. "Ten percent of our school is white and
the rest of the school is predominantly black and Latino,"
Milnor commented.
"We don't 'rule' the school, as a lot of these films like
'Bring It ()n' portray," Yosowitz of ('.happaral remarked.
In fact, 1 discovered that many of the squads are ridiculed
by their home schools. In response, Milnor concentrates
on group activities that build self-esteem.
"Camp ac tivities begin at 7 a.m. and end at 9 p.m. I set
.i mandatory team meeting 15 minutes afterward, before
showers and phone calls home," Milnor said. She begins
the meetings by having members of her team comment
on the day. They reflect on how a fellow team member im
proved or made a difference. A squad <)f over 30 students,
including several teenage boys, Silver Creek High
Raiders exemplifies how cheerleading has evolved.
Many of the students are not only teammates but
friends as well. So these team-bonding sessions are not su
perficial but sincere; they are structured to not only raise
team morale but to address the spec ific emotional needs
of the teenagers.
"I'm starting Chapparal this fall as a senior, and I don't
really know anyone; my family moved here from North
Carolina. I joined the team to make friends and to be rec
ognized at school," Chapparal senior Blake Reeves
shared. Reeves gained the respect of her peers almost in
stantly; as an accomplished dancer who performs with a
professional dance company, she has already been of

fered a dance scholarship from the University of Arizona.
She made the all star team at the elite USA cheer camp.
