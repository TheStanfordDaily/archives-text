# Cheer camps foster spirit

I was never exposed to cheerleaders as a
teenager; I attended an all girls private Catholic
school where athletes were an idolized, elite
clique. On Stanford's campus, Dollies do not
exactly occupy the coveted roles dramatized by
teen flic ks and mocked in the conversational
banter of "Dawson's Creek." In fact, "cheer
leader" does not necessarily equate "prom

Pom Squad of Chapparal High while docu

sociation (USA) Cheer Camps at Stanford.
Stern Hall's Kurbank dormitory hosted an elite
cheer camp for competitive teams on July 30 -
Aug. 2, 2000. A general cheer camp for all
cheering squads took place this past week, Aug.
17 - 20, in Governor's Corner.
"Most people trash on it," Gunderson High
School sophomore Terri Carter commented.
()pponents argue that cheerleaders offer sport
enthusiasts little more than mild titillation. ()th
ers find their dance-based routines comical.
While cheering on Wilbur field, the girls

were heckled by not only teenage male pedes

girls' activities. Men shouted from the windows
of the Marguerite, heckling the girls during
practice. 1 witnessed how teasing damages their
confidence and, in turn, crushes team morale.
Carter and her peers continue to cheer be
cause they enjoy the adrenaline rush of per
forming in front of crowded football stadiums
and gyms.
Regardless of what people say, cheerleaders
capture our attention; they hypnotize us with
their rhythmic clapping, synchronized forma
tions and high flying stunts. In a youth-driven
culture branded pop, cheerleaders blend the
choreography of a scripted make-believe with
the unpredictability of real-time sports. By am
plifying our game-time emotion, cheerleaders
shape audience reaction.
Cheerleading is a performance-based sport,
not unlike ice skating or synchronized swim
ming. Each year, an elite group of cheer teams
and songleading / pom squads compete, culmi
nating at ESPN Cheerleading nationals.
Chapparal High hires a choreographer for

the dance routines, and their trainer ensures
that the girls maintain a healthy diet and exer
cise program to build stamina and strength.
Iliey practice at least two hours daily after
school, and the choreographer teaches them

new moves three times a week. The time com
mitment is a minimum of seven hours a week
â€” equivalent to a part-time job for some.
"We learn one routine a week and perform
at football and basketball games, five pep as-
