# Dems return from DNC
## 
### JEFFREY TAM 
Last Thursday night, Vice President A 1 (jore spoke. In a firm voice and a
determined demeanor, he spelled out his agenda for America, from tax cuts
for the working poor to striving for universal health care to making college
tuition tax-deductible. And when the speech ended, so ended quite possibly
one of the most exciting weeks in the life of Steven Aronowitz, Class of 2000,
who attended the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles as a Cal
ifornia delegate.
Though he attended social events like the DNC Gala Concert with Bar
bra Streisand at the Shrine Auditorium, he found the best part of the week-

long convention to
be listening to the
main speakers, es
pecially presiden
tial candidate Gore
and his running
mate Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-
Conn.
Aronowitz said,
"Gore and Lieber
man were amazing.
They outlined a vi
sion for America
that included pro
viding clean air and
water for all Ameri
cans, health insur
ance for every child
.... Al Gore stood
on stage, looked
Americans in the
eye and said, I will
fight for you." That
is what this candi
dacy is about."
Krista Glaser,
a senior majoring
in political science
and feminist stud-

ies and chair of
the Stanford Democrats, was also there and had some of the same reactions
asAronowitz. She said that, "Everyone was energized and talking about the
issues, trying to effect change."
Glaser and nine of her fellow members of Stanford Democrats had the
opportunity to attend a luncheon with Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.), who rep
resents the district Stanford is located in (the 14th). Glaser said that she was
gratified to see "amazing leaders of the country hanging out" and to be "sur
rounded bv the party faithful, people who really care about politics and mak
ing a difference."
She was impressed by Gore's speech, but Lieberman's speech touched
her on a more personal level. Glaser worked in Lieberman's Washington
D.C. office this summer and had shared first-hand the surprise and excite
ment that Lieberman and others in his office felt when he was chosen to be
Gore's running mate.
Shaumo Sadhukhan, a senior majoring in chemistry who was also at the
convention as a member of the Stanford Democrats, had a more analvtical
reaction to the convention. He thought that it "underscored the need for
leadership in government and helped unifv the partv... .We are not uni
fied as the Republicans right now, but that is because we are a more inclusive
party with a diverse array of groups represented."
Now that the two major partv conventions are over, the national election
campaign finally begins. This week, both Gore and his Republican opponent
Gov. George W. Bush have been barnstorming across the Midwest. (.ore try
ing to get a convention bounce in the polls and Bush trving to dampen
Gore's momentum.
For Glaser and the Stanford 1 )emocrats, this autumn campaign will be quite
busy as well. In addition to working on voter registration and advocating( lore
on the national ticket, thev will be working to re-elect Eshoo and to elect Mike
Honda, a Democrat who is running for the Congressional seat vac ated In Stan
ford Law Prof Tom Campbell (R-Calif.), who is running for the I S Senate.
And while Aronowitz will not have as much time to spend on the campaign
now that he's graduated and working, lie won't turn a blind eye on n either.
In fact, Aronowitz will have to stay involved as he is currently emploved ,is po
litical assistant to eßay Senior Vice President Steven Westly, ( lass of '7«S.
That, in addition to his convention experience and his experience as
ASSU Undergraduate Senate chair, have convinced him that, "1 w ill alwavs
be involved with politics, not necessarily as a career, but as an important as
pect ofmv life. Getting involved in the decisions that effect you and the peo
ple you care about... is an empowering experience."
