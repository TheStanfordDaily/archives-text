## Stember sews up spot Down Under 
### BEN ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When Michael Stember crossed the
finish line in third place in the 1,500-
meter run at July's Olympic Track and
Field Trials, he earned a spot on the L'.S.
Olympic team headed lor Sydney — on
one condition.
Stember would be granted passage to
Svdne\ only it he could meet the (Olympic
'A' standard of 3 minutes, 36.H seconds
before the Sept. 11 deadline, just days be
fore the Games begin.
On Friday, with more than three
weeks to spare, Stember did just that,
blazing to a school-record 3:35.11 in the
Herculis Zepter Golden League meet in
Monte Garlo, Monaco.
Stember, who will be a senior upon his
return from the Games, stole the school
record out from under the seat of junior
teammate Gabe Jennings, who won the
Trials in 3:35.90 but has refrained from
racing since.
Until this point, Jennings has been a
step ahead of Stember — the duo went 1 -
2 in the NCAA indoor mile in March and
repeated that performance in die NCAA
outdoor 1,500 meters in June.

But while Jennings' time
at the Trials gave him the
luxury of a month's rest,
Stember set out on a quest
to better the standard, vow
ing to race in the United
States and then in Europe
until he dipped under the
time.
Alter a meet at Stanford
and two abroad (in Sweden
and Switzerland) failed to
produce results, it ap
peared as though Stanford
alumnus Jason Lunn, who
was fourth at the Trials,
would usurp Stember's
spot after a 3:36.74 of his
own in Switzerland.
But Friday's finish —
10th place, behind winner
William Chirchir of Kenya,
3:31.02 — ousted Lunn

and secured the third spot claimed by a
member of the Cardinal 2000 NCAA out
door championship team. Brad Hauser,
class of 2000, will compete in the 5,000-
meter run.
Stember will likely seek as much rest as
possible before the Olympics while main

taining a fitness and intensity level that
lias been elevated ever since the indoor
championships. He should have the ben
efit of joining Jennings and Stember be
fore traveling to Sydney when the three
will meet up in Germany for the Golden
League championship on Sept. 1.
