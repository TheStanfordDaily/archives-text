# Cardinal 'D' ready to step it up

### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stat geeks everywhere must have
truly loathed the Stanford football
team last season. Game in and game
out they could count on the Cardinal
defense to give up yards by the truck
load â€” leaving many pundits to con
tinually predict defeat each week,
when teams would finally catch on
and completely exploit the team's
weak I).
Except it never really happened.
Maligned as it was, the defense
never broke clown when the Cardinal
needed a tough stand, and after win
ning the Pacific 10 Conference the
squad found itself keeping a tough
Wisconsin team in check at the Rose
Bowl, keeping Stanford in the game
until the very end.
Flash forward to this summer, as the
football team readies for its season and
Pac-10 opener against Washington
State. The offense now has its own is
sues, dealing with a new quarterback
and raw receivers, but now, ironically, it
may he the defense who carries the team
at the start, with seven starters returning
plus a few interesting additions.
"I'm pleased about some areas and
concerned about some others," said
defensive coordinator Kent Baer fol

lowing practice Tuesday. "That's the
nature of training camp, and you just
have to work toward the areas you
know need to be addressed right now,
and see who starts. Overall, it's okay,
hut I'm not jumping up and down and
doing somersaults."
The rock the entire defense rests

on, as many players will admit, is se
nior tackle Willie Howard, winner of
list year's Morris Trophy as the top
defensive lineman in the l'ac-10.

With his right knee back to full strength, Willie Howard will be a handful for any Pac-10
lineman as he and the "Trenchdogs" hope to lead the Cardinal back to Pasadena.
