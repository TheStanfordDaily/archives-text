# Cardinal 'D' ready to step it up
## 
### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stat geeks everywhere must have
truly loathed the Stanford football
team last season. Game in and game
out they could count on the Cardinal
defense to give up yards by the truck
load — leaving many pundits to con
tinually predict defeat each week,
when teams would finally catch on
and completely exploit the team's
weak I).
Except it never really happened.
Maligned as it was, the defense
never broke clown when the Cardinal
needed a tough stand, and after win
ning the Pacific 10 Conference the
squad found itself keeping a tough
Wisconsin team in check at the Rose
Bowl, keeping Stanford in the game
until the very end.
Flash forward to this summer, as the
football team readies for its season and
Pac-10 opener against Washington
State. The offense now has its own is
sues, dealing with a new quarterback
and raw receivers, but now, ironically, it
may he the defense who carries the team
at the start, with seven starters returning
plus a few interesting additions.
"I'm pleased about some areas and
concerned about some others," said
defensive coordinator Kent Baer fol

lowing practice Tuesday. "That's the
nature of training camp, and you just
have to work toward the areas you
know need to be addressed right now,
and see who starts. Overall, it's okay,
hut I'm not jumping up and down and
doing somersaults."
The rock the entire defense rests

on, as many players will admit, is se
nior tackle Willie Howard, winner of
list year's Morris Trophy as the top
defensive lineman in the l'ac-10.
1 loward sustained damage to his right

With his right knee back to full strength, Willie Howard will be a handful for any Pac-10
lineman as he and the "Trenchdogs" hope to lead the Cardinal back to Pasadena.
against Notre Dame but amazingly rebounded to
play in the Rose Bowl, where he played a key role
in shutting down Heisman Trophy winner Ron
Dayne in the first half.
According to the head "Trenchdog" himself, his
knee is back to 100 percent, all of which the line
will need as they try to stop top runners like Ore
gon State's Ken Simonton and Washington's Paul
Arnold.
Up in the Palouse against Washington State, it
won't be the running backs who .are the problem.
WSU runs a spread offense with as many as five re
ceivers at a time, which will put the pressure di
rectly on the Cardinal's secondary. So far, though,
Baer likes what he sees.
"I am very pleased with Ryan Fernandez and
what he's done at corner," said Baer, when asked
who had surprised him in camp thus far. "In prac
tice, he's played ljis way into being a starter."
The other side of the field is in good hands with
senior Ruben Carter, who was probably the most
dependable member of the '99 secondary in man
to-man coverage. Rising junior Tank Williams and

senior Aaron Focht will join the two corners as the
starters, but don't he surprised to see many others
in the loop — like Coy Wire, recently converted
from running hack to safety — especially against
YVSU's spread offense.
Linebacker is one of the team's big question
marks due to loss of two solid starters in Marc
Stockbauer and Sharcus Steen, but Baer may have
a real gem on his hands in true freshman Anion
Gordon. Gordon, one of the top prep recruits in
the nation, has unbelievable athleticism and al
ready has delived some jaw-dropping hits, but he
needs to learn the defense before he can con
tribute significantly.
"He's making great progress. VVe fed him a lot,
in terms of our package and what we're asking him
to do," said Baer of Gordon. "What happens a lot
of times with a guy like that is that they play slow
er than they normally would because they're al
ways thinking instead of reacting when the ball
snaps. Eventually, that will come, and once he gets
that part tapped he's going to be a good football
player."
Of course, this should all be taken with a grain
of salt. The team has yet to play a single game,
alter all.
