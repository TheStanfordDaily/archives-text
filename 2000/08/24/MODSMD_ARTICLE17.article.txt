Miscellaneous Musings...
• ESPN has been working hard to lill the open slots in
its programming — and with mixed results. For example,
they've recently debuted something called the ESPN ()ut
d<x>rs Games. Translated: What can we do with a dead
tree? Let's see ... you've got logrolling, log climbing, log
cutting/chopping, etc., .ill of which have tailed to capture

the interest ol the urban audi
ence (or the national audi
ence, for that matter). ()n the

other end of the spectrum, the great spectacle that is The
World's Strongest Man rarely disappoints. Leave aside the
fact that we're not sure the winner is actually the world's
strongest — have you seen the wide range of events in
which these massive men compete? Boulder Carry, Keg
Toss, Bus Pull, etc.... Now that's entertainment.
• Watching tennis recently, I couldn't help but think
that those ball boys and girls were not having much fun
during the match as they scurried across the court like
meek automations. If 1 were somehow [mistakenly] se
lected to be a ball boy, I would take a different approach.
For example, if the ball was hit into the net on an impor
tant shot, I'd saunter nonchalantly to the net, pick up the
ball, point at Andre Agassi and say something to the tune
of, "I bet you wish you could have that one back, pretty
boy."
• A lot of locals have been complaining that Pac Bell
fans are too tame and civilized. 1 have the solution: we ship
in soccer hooligans. Even if they don't understand the
game, they'll likely riot at the lofty price of beer and add
some needed anarchy to the ballpark.
• Speaking of the Giants' new home, I heard the team
of Portuguese water dogs, who have been trained to re
trieve balls from McC lovey (love, has been hesitant to leave
the comforts of their boat. 1 don't blame them — have you
seen the color of that water recently?
• Staying on the subject of baseball, I think the Giants
were wise to steer clear of following the blueprints of
Houston's new Enron Field. This is the ballpark with a hill
(yes, a hill) on the outfield warning track and a flagpole lo
cated nearby (in-play). These obstacles are supposed to
eliminate the monotony that might normally be associat
ed with a routine fly ball. On the same line of thinking,
why didn't they just put a pond in shallow center field? It
would make things interesting as well. Concerned with
aesthetics? We could stock it with a few frogs and goldfish.
• Speaking of water hazards, what our country really
needs is more miniature golf . Sure, Tiger Woods is dom
inating the professional circuit right now, but wait 'till he
has to start playing courses named "Fred's Vlini-( »ol (Fan
tasy Funhouse and Putt-Putt Paradise." We'll see how
Tiger's short game fares when there is a windmill turning
over the hole and kids crying on the next hole over.
• 1 could go on and on about why I hate auto racing, but
I'll limit myself to drag racing. This you might not have
seen, since the races last less tfian 10 seconds. Basically, you
have two huge cars, each resembling tires stuck to rocket en
gines, that race parallel to each other on a straight track.
ITiey reach speeds ofover 200 mph and they require para
chutes to stop them after the race. After the race (and after
the drivers have been informed which one of them won),
the drivers are always interviewed and the questions always
go something like: "Was that a good run for you?" I want to
know exac tly how these guys know when they had a "good
run." If 1 were driver, 1 think my sole
criteria would l)e "did my car blow
up?" If not, then I'd say, "It was a
great run, and the car really handled
well. I want to thank my entire team."
(And you wonder why the drivers in
cessantly praise their mechanics.)
• That brings me to two "sports"
that really should not be televised:
fishing and hunting. Fox's Live
Bass Fishing special rivaled the lack
of drama seen in such shows as
CBS's "Big Brother." Hunting
shows don't do it for me either: Gee,
can this guy, perched in a tree,
dressed in camouflage (who has
gone so far as to cover himself in an
imal urine to disguise his scent) and
with a laser sight-equipped sniper
rifle, really miss hitting that 200 plus
pound stag which has been lured
with food to eat unassumingly di
rectly below the perched sharp

shooter? What drama! What a
"sport!"
• That's what is so great about
wrestling: the spontaneity and un
predictability. It might look like your
man is going down lor the count, but
just when you think it's curtain time
six other wrestlers (who have formed
a secret alliance backstage) rush into
the ring with chairs and other house
hold objects and proceed to pummel
the opponent, rendering him sense
less. That is great stuff.
• 1 liked television coverage be
fore the wireless age. Now television
has the "umpire camera" in football,
and the "catcher's mask camera" in
baseball, among others. If we contin
ue to follow these trends, expect the
local hot dog vendors to soon offer
you another "unique angle" on the
game — the "wiener cam."
