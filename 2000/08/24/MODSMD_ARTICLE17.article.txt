Miscellaneous Musings...
• ESPN has been working hard to lill the open slots in
its programming — and with mixed results. For example,
they've recently debuted something called the ESPN ()ut
d<x>rs Games. Translated: What can we do with a dead
tree? Let's see ... you've got logrolling, log climbing, log
cutting/chopping, etc., .ill of which have tailed to capture

the interest ol the urban audi
ence (or the national audi
ence, for that matter). ()n the

other end of the spectrum, the great spectacle that is The
World's Strongest Man rarely disappoints. Leave aside the
fact that we're not sure the winner is actually the world's
strongest — have you seen the wide range of events in
which these massive men compete? Boulder Carry, Keg
Toss, Bus Pull, etc.... Now that's entertainment.
• Watching tennis recently, I couldn't help but think
that those ball boys and girls were not having much fun
during the match as they scurried across the court like
meek automations. If 1 were somehow [mistakenly] se
lected to be a ball boy, I would take a different approach.
For example, if the ball was hit into the net on an impor
tant shot, I'd saunter nonchalantly to the net, pick up the
ball, point at Andre Agassi and say something to the tune
of, "I bet you wish you could have that one back, pretty
boy."
• A lot of locals have been complaining that Pac Bell
fans are too tame and civilized. 1 have the solution: we ship
in soccer hooligans. Even if they don't understand the
game, they'll likely riot at the lofty price of beer and add
some needed anarchy to the ballpark.
• Speaking of the Giants' new home, I heard the team
of Portuguese water dogs, who have been trained to re
trieve balls from McC lovey (love, has been hesitant to leave
the comforts of their boat. 1 don't blame them — have you
seen the color of that water recently?
• Staying on the subject of baseball, I think the Giants
were wise to steer clear of following the blueprints of
Houston's new Enron Field. This is the ballpark with a hill
(yes, a hill) on the outfield warning track and a flagpole lo
cated nearby (in-play). These obstacles are supposed to
eliminate the monotony that might normally be associat
ed with a routine fly ball. On the same line of thinking,
why didn't they just put a pond in shallow center field? It
would make things interesting as well. Concerned with
aesthetics? We could stock it with a few frogs and goldfish.
• Speaking of water hazards, what our country really
needs is more miniature golf . Sure, Tiger Woods is dom
inating the professional circuit right now, but wait 'till he
has to start playing courses named "Fred's Vlini-( »ol (Fan
tasy Funhouse and Putt-Putt Paradise." We'll see how
Tiger's short game fares when there is a windmill turning
over the hole and kids crying on the next hole over.
• 1 could go on and on about why I hate auto racing, but
I'll limit myself to drag racing. This you might not have
seen, since the races last less tfian 10 seconds. Basically, you
have two huge cars, each resembling tires stuck to rocket en
gines, that race parallel to each other on a straight track.
ITiey reach speeds ofover 200 mph and they require para
chutes to stop them after the race. After the race (and after
the drivers have been informed which one of them won),
the drivers are always interviewed and the questions always
go something like: "Was that a good run for you?" I want to
know exac tly how these guys know when they had a "good
