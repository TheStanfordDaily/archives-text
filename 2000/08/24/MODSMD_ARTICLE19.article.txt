## 'Cell' just a pretty Lopez vehicle 
### HILARY BIENSTOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"To save the hapless victim, she must enter the mind of
a killer." Sounds thrilling. Sounds suspenseful. Sounds
dangerous. Sound familiar?
It seems that every year Hollywood tries to foist yet an
other psvcho-thriller upon the movie-going masses. The
recipe is simple. Start out with an intelligent and enipa
thetic (and. let's not forget, beautiful) woman working on
the right side of the law. Add a crazed murderer who has

some creative way of
torturing his victims or
some particularly
gruesome plans for
their remains. The
killer knows a secret:
he has the clue to
where the latest poor

victim (usualh a young, helpless, nubile girl) is waiting. In
only a short time, the murderer's prey will succumb to her
grisly fate, unless somehow the beautiful woman can learn
from the killer where the young girl is hidden and save her.
Admittedly, these movies can be delightfully suspenseful
and frightening, but there have been so many of them late
ly that by now, they've got to be especially innovative and
well-done to capture our imagination.
In"The Cell," Jennifer Lopez plays a therapist who uses
a newfangled scientific technique to literally enter the
minds of her comatose patients, permeating their subcon
scious. Vincent D'Onofrio is the killer who captures and
murders a string of doll-like young women and then uses
them as his own dolls in his twisted games.
But when caught, D'Onofrio enters a seizure-induced
coma, leaving his last victim trapped in a torture cell in an

unknown location. In 40 hours, the automated room will
fill with water and the girl will drown unless the FBI agent
on the case (Vince Vaughn) can convince Lope/, to enter
IVOnofrio's mind and, they hope, discover the victim's
whereabouts.
The movie is directed by newcomer Tarsein Singh,
whose movie debut follows a relatively distinguished career
making commercials and music videos. And indeed, the
strengths of this movie are those of a good music video: the
surrealistic scenes that take place in comatose D'Onofrio's
mind are beautiful and memorable, if gruesome. They're
not particularly innovative in their imagery; Singh admits
that he borrowed heavily from Jung, and, it seems, every
dream interpreter in the business.
But the mental landscapes, which include women por
trayed as sex slaves and clockwork dolls and D'Onofrio as a
demon lord in heavy capes and ornate headgear, are spec
tacular enough that we don't mind the lack of creativity. At
least the killer's subconscious is more exciting than Lopez's,
which involves obviously fake cherry blossom trees, piles of
plastic snow and Lopez as a somewhat sacrilegous imitation
of the Virgin Mary.
The plot, however, is formulaic, and the actors are as
mediocre as befits this bland retelling of the same old story.
Lopez looks great in the fantastic dream-world costumes,
and she can successfully get away with an amazing number
of different lipstick shades and hairstyles. The costumes
and makeup speak for themselves, which is good, because
as an actress Lopez needs all the help she can get.
D'Onofrio proves similarly untalented as he oscillates
between two different moods: brutish, homely and tor
tured by headaches in the real-world scenes and brutish,
grotesque and tortured by his own seething subconscious

in the dream-world segments. Al
though lie tries hard to be the de
ranged stuff of nightmares, he's
most convincing when he portrays
the murderer in his comatose state.
Vaughn, as the FBI agent, is a
milquetoast: although supposedly
an important part of the movie,
he's so unremarkable he barely de
serves mention in this review.
As for the story, it's missing
those extra little touches that could
boost it from a run-of-the-mill
thriller to the scare of the summer.
In a movie of this type, the psy

chotic killer should do something
really devilishly disgusting with his
victims. Remember the frisson of
horror you got from discovering
that "The Silence of the Lambs'"
murderer was actually making a
dress out of human skin?
But IVOnofrio is really just a
necrophiliac who's into sado
masochism: first he watches his vic
tim slowly drown, then he lays
them out and, by means of a hoist
that attaches to rings pierced in his
back, hovers over them before pre
sumably consummating the mur
der.
Although it's chilling to see a
nude man hanging from his body
piercings, it's a visceral reaction
and not the mental shock the film

makers were hoping for. And it's
emblematic of what this movie
does: because it just isn't original
enough to muster up enough ter
ror at the ingenious insanity of the
killer, it substitutes the horror of
brutality, blood, gore and above
all, pain.
"The Cell" isn't a terrible
movie, and the gorgeous visuals
are certainly worth seeing. The
artistic team behind the look of
the film deserves a round of ap
plause for translating Singh's
humdrum vision into a breathtak
ing series of larger-than-life
scenes. But for the discerning
moviegoer who prefers to watch
films for their plots, this movie will
be all stvle and no substance.
