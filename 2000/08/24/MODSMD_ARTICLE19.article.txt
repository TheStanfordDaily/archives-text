## 'Cell' just a pretty Lopez vehicle 
### HILARY BIENSTOCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"To save the hapless victim, she must enter the mind of
a killer." Sounds thrilling. Sounds suspenseful. Sounds
dangerous. Sound familiar?
It seems that every year Hollywood tries to foist yet an
other psvcho-thriller upon the movie-going masses. The
recipe is simple. Start out with an intelligent and enipa
thetic (and. let's not forget, beautiful) woman working on
the right side of the law. Add a crazed murderer who has

some creative way of
torturing his victims or
some particularly
gruesome plans for
their remains. The
killer knows a secret:
he has the clue to
where the latest poor

victim (usualh a young, helpless, nubile girl) is waiting. In
only a short time, the murderer's prey will succumb to her
grisly fate, unless somehow the beautiful woman can learn
from the killer where the young girl is hidden and save her.
Admittedly, these movies can be delightfully suspenseful
and frightening, but there have been so many of them late
ly that by now, they've got to be especially innovative and
well-done to capture our imagination.
In"The Cell," Jennifer Lopez plays a therapist who uses
a newfangled scientific technique to literally enter the
minds of her comatose patients, permeating their subcon
scious. Vincent D'Onofrio is the killer who captures and
murders a string of doll-like young women and then uses
them as his own dolls in his twisted games.
But when caught, D'Onofrio enters a seizure-induced
coma, leaving his last victim trapped in a torture cell in an

unknown location. In 40 hours, the automated room will
fill with water and the girl will drown unless the FBI agent
on the case (Vince Vaughn) can convince Lope/, to enter
IVOnofrio's mind and, they hope, discover the victim's
whereabouts.
The movie is directed by newcomer Tarsein Singh,
whose movie debut follows a relatively distinguished career
making commercials and music videos. And indeed, the
strengths of this movie are those of a good music video: the
surrealistic scenes that take place in comatose D'Onofrio's
mind are beautiful and memorable, if gruesome. They're
not particularly innovative in their imagery; Singh admits
that he borrowed heavily from Jung, and, it seems, every
dream interpreter in the business.
But the mental landscapes, which include women por
trayed as sex slaves and clockwork dolls and D'Onofrio as a
demon lord in heavy capes and ornate headgear, are spec
tacular enough that we don't mind the lack of creativity. At
least the killer's subconscious is more exciting than Lopez's,
which involves obviously fake cherry blossom trees, piles of
plastic snow and Lopez as a somewhat sacrilegous imitation
of the Virgin Mary.
The plot, however, is formulaic, and the actors are as
mediocre as befits this bland retelling of the same old story.
Lopez looks great in the fantastic dream-world costumes,
and she can successfully get away with an amazing number
of different lipstick shades and hairstyles. The costumes
and makeup speak for themselves, which is good, because
as an actress Lopez needs all the help she can get.
D'Onofrio proves similarly untalented as he oscillates
between two different moods: brutish, homely and tor
tured by headaches in the real-world scenes and brutish,
grotesque and tortured by his own seething subconscious
