"The Replacements" may be many things, but
desperate (thankfully) isn't necessarily one of them.
It's simply a light-hearted, easy-going comedy
(about football!) that effortlessly earns its place as a

summer guilty
pleasure of a film.

ers are striking
("Five million
dollars may seem
like a lot, but I

have to give 10 percent to my agent!"), so in come a
rag-tag bunch of lovable losers to keep the Wash
ington Sentinels afloat. They span all walks of life
(convenience store clerk, bodyguard, convict), and
within a few weeks time they become a solid bunch
of (caricatured) cronies.
Coach (Gene Hackman) attributes their success
to: "Heart. Miles and miles of heart." (I laughed
when I heard that too). And the outcome depends
on the has-been-cum-hermit of a quarterback Shane
Falco (movie moral: if you sound like a winner, you
probably are), who must find his inner strength to
lead the team to victory. Sounds familiar? Well obvi
ously the writer behind "Operation Dumbo Drop"

got lucky to get Neo to play the pensive savior.
The film's automatic lack of merit (predeter
mined by the cliche themes of high school: football,
cheerleaders, bullies and losers) is offset by a deli
ciously eccentric cast. There's the 7-LJp guy (Orlan
do Jones) as a butter-fingered receiver, Swingers
star (Jon Favreau) as an über-aggressive cop and
Hugh Grant's butt-itching roommate from "Notting
Hill" (Rhys Ifans) as a chain-smoking Welsh kicker.
It's comforting to know that these up-and-coming
actors can use this film to score some better roles.
All in all, the movie is a cute story with enough
laughs to keep one entertained for an afternoon.
"The Replacements" saving grace? It doesn't aspire
to be anything more.
