### ADAM WOOLEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
What do you get when you throw a womanizing kindergarten
teacher, a super-cool philosophy of life and beautiful New Mexico
landscapes into a blender? An easy going, enjoyable comedy called
"The Tao of Steve."
"The Tao of Steve" is a romantic comedy set in Santa Fe, N.M. It is
the story of l)ex (Donal Logue), a

former college "lady killer" who has
become an overweight, pot-smok
ing kindergarten teacher, and his
unique Zen approach to the pursuit
of women.
What really separates "The
Tao of Steve" from the run-of-the-

mill romantic comedy is that the
characters are easy to identify with. Instead of a young hunk as our
"hero" and a hot young starlet that is afraid to fall in love, we've got a
slacker of "immense" proportions and a smart, sarcastic theater set de
signer. Opening the film with a scene at Dex's college reunion, direc
tor Jenniphr Goodman skillfully places us in the lives of Dex and his
friends — making the audience feel as though these are actually peo
ple they know.
The film gets its name from Dex's novel philosophy about life and
the opposite sex. In several of the film's scenes, Dex explains his en
tertaining combination of eastern philosophy and ideal American
coolness (based on Steve McQueen movies). Dex advises his less ro
mantically successful friends with pearls of wisdom concerning how to
score with women without having been blessed with stunning good
looks. The film follows Dex as he preaches his "coolness" philosophy
while simultaneously discovering he may have to change his ways to

get the woman he is falling for.
As with most romantic come
dies, the storyline of the film is
not what makes it worth watch
ing. The plot is simple and easily
predictable. What really makes
the film entertaining is Logue's
performance as Dex. Logue is
one of those actors that will prob
ably look vaguely familiar (most
recently seen as a reformed racist
in"The Patriot"); with this film
he has, without a doubt, proven
his ability to shine in a starring
role.
Logue won a very well-de
served acting award at the Sun
dance Film Festival for the role.
He easily steals the scene every
moment he is on screen, provid
ing near continuous humor for
the audience. As Dex, Logue
cruises through the film radiating
confidence and charm, making
us believe that a fat, scruffv-look

ing slacker could really he a ladies
man. Best of all, Dex seems to be
as amused as we are by his own
antics in the film.
The female lead, Syd, played
by the director's sister Greer
Goodman, has a much more
common character to play.
While the role of intelligent
woman immune to the leading
man's charm is certainly not new
to romantic comedies, Goodman
plays it extremely well. The
chemistry between Dex and Syd
is wonderful. Even though it is
easy to guess what will happen
whenever they are together, the
interaction between them is al
ways fun to watch.
The bottom line is that while
the story may be a little pre
dictable — sugarcoated, roman
tic-comedy ending included —
the film is still very enjoyable.
Jenniphr Goodman makes great
use of the New Mexico setting,
the characters feel real and the
acting is great. Even with a pre
dictable happy ending, it is won
derful to sit and watch Dex have
a blast.
