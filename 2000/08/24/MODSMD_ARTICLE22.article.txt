# 'Cyrano' in Marin is a delightful caper

### VLADA TEPER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"She might laugh at me and
that is the only thing in the world
1 fear," admits the proud protag
onist in the Marin Shakespeare
Company's production of "Cyra
no de Bergerac."
He has nothing to fear, and yet
Cyrano's inability to speak to
Roxanne is key to the plot. With
acting that provokes applause
and laughter only when so in
tended, Edmond Rostand's story
becomes inspiring, well-per-

formed verse in Director James
Dunn's version of the romantic
classic.
The now well-known tale has
been portrayed in film by Jose
Ferer (who won an Oscar for the
role), Gerard Depardieu and
most recently Steve Martin. I low
ever, there is no need to fear the
capabilities of the MSC actors.
Michael Santo's development of
Cyrjrtno de Bergerac's character is
convincing and touching.
The "swashbuckling soldier
poet" quickly presents himself to
the town and audience members
as audacious and strong-minded
by stopping a play within a play
when he supposedly dislikes the
acting. What follows is a rhyming
sword-figlu. Skillfully and grace
fully , Cyrano shows his skill as a
poet at the same time he proves
his talent with the sword.
With Santo's help Cyrano
comes alive with his unshakable
pride, as well as his oversized
nose, as a poet-soldier who falls
for the beautiful Roxanne. It is
that very love and honor that
binds him, upon Roxanne's re
quest, to Roxanne's own beloved
— the handsome and awkward
worded Christian (Jason Heil).
Promising to protect Christian
when he is put into Cyrano's
army regiment, Cyrano offers his
poetic talents when Christian
tries to woo Roxanne. Roxanne
(Marcia Pizzo) is an intelligent
and beautiful woman who loves a
handsome face as well as hand
some verse and has high expecta
tions of Christian.
The slew of supporting actors
is superb. Le Bret (Fred Ochs) is
a concerned and understanding
best friend to Cyrano, and Comte
de Guiche (Kenneth Rowland;
also the set designer) is a good
bad-guy who despises Cyrano's
wit, lusts after Roxanne and

sends Christian to do battle. Anne
Ripley is a mischievous compan
ion to Roxanne as well as holy
Mother Marguerite, and Rague
neau (Jonathan Gonzalez) is a
baker who rhymes his recipes on
paper that his wife uses as wrap
pers for his baked goods.
There is also no need to fear
the challenges inherent in per
forming in an outdoor theater.
True, in the last scene of Act 11,
Roxanne does exclaim mislead
ingly, "But how can you read the
letter in the dark?" as Cyrano
reads the letter from memory
while the sun is still far from turn
ing the sky red.
The line of fiction is momen
tarily interrupted, but imagina
tion can set it straight. Otherwise,
the natural sun seemed to be an
aid,, as in the night scene both
Christian and Cyrano were in
deed hidden by the shadows
while the light crew helped illu
minate Roxanne's face.
The designers achieve the
right period look."You're going
to see a lady ... then it must be
Paris," laughs one of the charac
ters. His witty remark is helpful
but not all-important. The
plumes blowing in the August
breeze as they adorn each sol
dier's hat, as well as the cloaks
and the swords they wear all hint
at the 17th century France of the
Three Musketeers. Designer
Pamela Johnson is careful and
accurate. The work with the cos
tumes is seamless — the dresses
of both the cavaliers and the
Mademoiselles look as dashing
and appropriate from the sec
ond row as they do from the
20th.
The same is true of the make
up. Bruises, eye-bags and ex
haustion tell of long days in an
encampment. Cyrano's nose is
his own and suitably ugly and
Roxanne's curls are coquettish,
17th century.
Based on the original story of
Savien Cyrano of 1619 Paris, the
MSC's version is set in an open
courtyard. The set is simple yet
effective. With "marbleized"
columns, arches and balconies,
the static fagade gives way to a
projecting oven for the bakery
scene and later to the suggestion
of an encampment before a battle
in Act 11.
Having no fear in the effective
recital of poetry and gallantries,
words are well presented and al
lowed to lead the action. Prose
and verse are set in the right en
vironment to intrigue, interest
and keep one on his toes. The
Parisian Cyrano leaves us with a
reminder of honor's definition as
well as the beauty inherent in
romantic words.
