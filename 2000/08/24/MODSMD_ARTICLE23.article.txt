# X-Men game rehashes the tried and true
## 
### JUNG LAH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the past 36 years, Marvel
Comics' X-Men has sold over 30-
million comic books each year, en
tertaining countless fans captivat
ed by healthy doses of spectacular
mutant powers mixed with
themes of social equality. Becom
ing the most successful comic
book property of all time, howev
er, leads to one inevitable result:
an endless barrage of merchan
dising.
The X-Men animated cartoon
series has recently started re-air-

ing on Fox to coincide with the
movie release, which has already
pulled in over $100 million in
grosses nationwide. Activision,
fresh off the heels of their hugely
popular Playstation game Tony
Hawk's Pro Skater, has now re
leased X-Men Mutant Academy, a
fighting game for the Sony con
sole system, with the hopes of at
tracting fans of both the comic
and the new movie alike.
In all fairness, Capcom already
came up with this idea years ago
when they merged the X-Men
with their Street Fighter fran
chise, and the result was nothing
short of spectacular. The X-Men
vs. Street Fighter and Marvel vs.
Capcom series continued to ce
ment Capcom as the premiere
name in one-on-one fighting
games.
Ever since Street Fighter II
came out over 10 years ago, al
most every successful fighting
game has copied its execution of
special moves, highlighted by
quarter-circle and back-to-front
joystick motions.
X-Men Mutant Academy is no
exception to this rule, and anyone
who has ever played Street Fight
er will feel right at home turning
out Cyclops' optic blast or Storm's
lightning bolts. Using the same
gaming engine as the Wu-Tang
Playstation fighting game, Activi
sion has created a nice two-player
superhero-fest with superb
graphics and a healthy number of
gaining options.
Players can choose from arcade
mode and versus mode, where
you either fight the computer or
another human-controlled play
er. Survival mode, the least inter
esting and most unnecessary of
the modes, tests how long you can
hist without losing a match.
Academy Training, on the
other hand, is a mostlv useful
teaching-mode where Professor
\ instructs each fiehter on how to

execute everything from throws
to super moves. Some of the train
ing involves standard punch and
kick moves so basic that, if you
can't figure them out yourself,
you probably shouldn't even be
playing video games.
On the other hand, the charac
ters' special moves are somewhat
difficult to execute, often involv
ing random button and joypad se
quences that are difficult to re
member during actual matches.
Depending on how well you fight
you receive a grade, and better
grades lead to the unlocking of
many of the game's secrets.
The secrets can be viewed in
Cerebro mode and are, for the
most part, computer-graphic im
ages of the X-Men fighting Sen
tinels or acting tough. They are
not very long, however, and some
are just lame, which means you
might be spending a long time
training or trying to beat the
game with weaker characters and
not receiving much of a payoff in
the end.
Other secrets include promo
tional tie-ins, such as the movie
trailer or behind-the-scenes
movie c lips. There is also a feature
on classic X-Men comic book cov
ers that might please some fans;
all in all, though, it almost feels as
if unlocking all the secrets is too
long of a process, taking up game

space which could have potential
ly been devoted to adding addi
tional characters or moves.
As it stands, you can choose
from any of six X-Men: Cyclops,
Wolverine, Gambit, Beast, Storm
and Phoenix. Vou can also unlock
the super-villain characters Toad,
Mystique, Sabertooth and Mag
neto. Each character is rated on a
scale that includes strength and
healing, which really comes into
play nicely when taking into ac
count some of the characters' mu
tant powers.
For instance, Wolverine and
Sabertooth heal back their power
much more than the other char
acters, but without any projectile
attacks their range is severely lim
ited.
Other mutant power features,
however, are really mishandled.
Mystique, a shapeshifter, should
have been an amazing character
with the ability to morph into an\
other character and utilize their
moves. Instead, Activision just
stuck her with a big gun, making
"skilled with guns" her special
"power."
Also, some characters are flat
out superior to others. Cyclops,
with his long range optic blasts,
can effectively attack anyone from
any where. And while it was a nice

touch having Jean Gray incarnat
ed as the Phoenix, her lighting
powers are so weak that you won
der how the Phoenix entity, which
feeds off of stars and can destroy
entire galaxies, can justify staying
inside Jean's bod)' as she constant
ly loses round after round.
The fact that some of the fight
ers have "movie costume" attire is
only another painful reminder of
the cinematic commercialization
of the game, as is the presence of
the annoying Toad. And where is
Rogue or a healthier mix of ene
mies like the Juggernaut or Apoc
alypse? There's no way Activision
could have included every great
X-Men character, but some are
more logical choices than others
for a lighting game such as this
one.
In all honesty, X-Men Mutant
Academy is an entertaining game
that may not be completely origi
nal but will certainly interest X-
Men fans and fighting game fans.
There are a few innovations to
keep things from seeming too fa
miliar, such as throw moves where
the camera shifts to a 3-D mode
and "Matrix "-like slow motion ef

fects come into play.
It's great to hear the one-liners
the characters say to one another,
and the voices sound the same as
in the cartoon series. And the
three super bars which indicate
when you can execute certain spe
cial moves have the excellent fea
ture of being able to shift power
from one bar to another. Having

to push the"x" button rapidly in
order to turn out the mega-pow
erful super moves is also a nice
touch.
So what's the bottom line?
You've most likely played games
like this before. But that certainly
doesn't mean that, apart from a
few minor flaws, you won't enjoy
playing this one as well.

the camera shifts to a 3-D mode
and "Matrix "-like slow motion ef

fects come into play.
It's great to hear the one-liners
the characters say to one another,
and the voices sound the same as
in the cartoon series. And the
three super bars which indicate
when you can execute certain spe
cial moves have the excellent fea
ture of being able to shift power
from one bar to another. Having

to push the"x" button rapidly in
order to turn out the mega-pow
erful super moves is also a nice
touch.
So what's the bottom line?
You've most likely played games
like this before. But that certainly
doesn't mean that, apart from a
few minor flaws, you won't enjoy
playing this one as well.
For the past 36 years, Marvel
Comics' X-Men has sold over 30-
million comic books each year, en
tertaining countless fans captivat
ed by healthy doses of spectacular
mutant powers mixed with
themes of social equality. Becom
ing the most successful comic
book property of all time, howev
er, leads to one inevitable result:
an endless barrage of merchan
dising.
The X-Men animated cartoon
series has recently started re-air-

ing on Fox to coincide with the
movie release, which has already
pulled in over $100 million in
grosses nationwide. Activision,
fresh off the heels of their hugely
popular Playstation game Tony
Hawk's Pro Skater, has now re
leased X-Men Mutant Academy, a
fighting game for the Sony con
sole system, with the hopes of at
tracting fans of both the comic
and the new movie alike.
In all fairness, Capcom already
came up with this idea years ago
when they merged the X-Men
with their Street Fighter fran
chise, and the result was nothing
short of spectacular. The X-Men
vs. Street Fighter and Marvel vs.
Capcom series continued to ce
ment Capcom as the premiere
name in one-on-one fighting
games.
Ever since Street Fighter II
came out over 10 years ago, al
most every successful fighting
game has copied its execution of
special moves, highlighted by
quarter-circle and back-to-front
joystick motions.
X-Men Mutant Academy is no
exception to this rule, and anyone
who has ever played Street Fight
er will feel right at home turning
out Cyclops' optic blast or Storm's
lightning bolts. Using the same
gaming engine as the Wu-Tang
Playstation fighting game, Activi
sion has created a nice two-player
superhero-fest with superb
graphics and a healthy number of
gaining options.
Players can choose from arcade
mode and versus mode, where
you either fight the computer or
another human-controlled play
er. Survival mode, the least inter
esting and most unnecessary of
the modes, tests how long you can
hist without losing a match.
Academy Training, on the
other hand, is a mostlv useful
teaching-mode where Professor
\ instructs each fiehter on how to

execute everything from throws
to super moves. Some of the train
ing involves standard punch and
kick moves so basic that, if you
can't figure them out yourself,
you probably shouldn't even be
playing video games.
On the other hand, the charac
ters' special moves are somewhat
difficult to execute, often involv
ing random button and joypad se
quences that are difficult to re
member during actual matches.
Depending on how well you fight
you receive a grade, and better
grades lead to the unlocking of
many of the game's secrets.
The secrets can be viewed in
Cerebro mode and are, for the
most part, computer-graphic im
ages of the X-Men fighting Sen
tinels or acting tough. They are
not very long, however, and some
are just lame, which means you
might be spending a long time
training or trying to beat the
game with weaker characters and
not receiving much of a payoff in
the end.
Other secrets include promo
tional tie-ins, such as the movie
trailer or behind-the-scenes
movie c lips. There is also a feature
on classic X-Men comic book cov
ers that might please some fans;
all in all, though, it almost feels as
if unlocking all the secrets is too
long of a process, taking up game

space which could have potential
ly been devoted to adding addi
tional characters or moves.
As it stands, you can choose
from any of six X-Men: Cyclops,
Wolverine, Gambit, Beast, Storm
and Phoenix. Vou can also unlock
the super-villain characters Toad,
Mystique, Sabertooth and Mag
neto. Each character is rated on a
scale that includes strength and
healing, which really comes into
play nicely when taking into ac
count some of the characters' mu
tant powers.
For instance, Wolverine and
Sabertooth heal back their power
much more than the other char
acters, but without any projectile
attacks their range is severely lim
ited.
Other mutant power features,
however, are really mishandled.
Mystique, a shapeshifter, should
have been an amazing character
with the ability to morph into an\
other character and utilize their
moves. Instead, Activision just
stuck her with a big gun, making
"skilled with guns" her special
"power."
Also, some characters are flat
out superior to others. Cyclops,
with his long range optic blasts,
can effectively attack anyone from
any where. And while it was a nice

touch having Jean Gray incarnat
ed as the Phoenix, her lighting
powers are so weak that you won
der how the Phoenix entity, which
feeds off of stars and can destroy
entire galaxies, can justify staying
inside Jean's bod)' as she constant
ly loses round after round.
The fact that some of the fight
ers have "movie costume" attire is
only another painful reminder of
the cinematic commercialization
of the game, as is the presence of
the annoying Toad. And where is
Rogue or a healthier mix of ene
mies like the Juggernaut or Apoc
alypse? There's no way Activision
could have included every great
X-Men character, but some are
more logical choices than others
for a lighting game such as this
one.
In all honesty, X-Men Mutant
Academy is an entertaining game
that may not be completely origi
nal but will certainly interest X-
Men fans and fighting game fans.
There are a few innovations to
keep things from seeming too fa
miliar, such as throw moves where
the camera shifts to a 3-D mode
and "Matrix "-like slow motion ef

fects come into play.
It's great to hear the one-liners
the characters say to one another,
and the voices sound the same as
in the cartoon series. And the
three super bars which indicate
when you can execute certain spe
cial moves have the excellent fea
ture of being able to shift power
from one bar to another. Having

to push the"x" button rapidly in
order to turn out the mega-pow
erful super moves is also a nice
touch.
So what's the bottom line?
You've most likely played games
like this before. But that certainly
doesn't mean that, apart from a
few minor flaws, you won't enjoy
playing this one as well.
