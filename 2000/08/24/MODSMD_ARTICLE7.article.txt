## The 						Stanford Renaissance: A final look at the Casper years 
### GREG BRAZEAL EDITORIAL STAFF 
A university education does not lend itself to students hav
ing a sense of their university's past. The student body remains
perpetually young, and its collective memory hardly stretches
back four years. Vou come to a school to learn from it, end up
spending a tew years finding your way through it, and if by ac
cident or catastrophe you somehow manage to catch a glimpse
of (he way it was before you, that glimpse probably arrives more
or less as you pack your bags to leave.
This is especially the case if you arrived at Stanford in the
final years of University President Gerhard Casper's tenure.
The late '90s were calm except for the occasional rain storm,
prosperous except for a single unfortunate hospital merger,
upbeat and cheery unless you were a homeless graduate stu
dent — and it was only a matter of time before that problem
was remedied as well. Now and then you heard the cloudy
term "indirect cost," usually followed by the word "controver
sy," but you shrugged off both with a smile and returned to
playing Frisbee. ft seemed that things had always been this way
on the Farm and always would be, only better.
The Unbearable Lightness of Graduation
The point is not that most students are unaware that Tres
sider and Wilbur were once presidents, just like C lasper, or that
Stanford was a fairly unremarkable undergraduate college be
fbre World War 11, little recognized outside (lalifornia or even
that late in the '80s Stanford was number one in the U.S. News
&: World Report college rankings that it now so vocally ignores:
the point is that it is difficult for a student to realize how much
difference eight years, like the eight years of Casper's presi
dency, can make to their undergraduate experiences.
Set aside AXESS, which did not debut until 1992, and be
fore which people registered for classes by waiting in notori
ously long lines at the Registrar's office. Set aside the Stanford
in-Moscow campus, launched in 1993. Set aside the renovated
Bing Wing and the Cantor Arts Center and the Science En
gineering Quad, which you probably still think of as new,
though of course in the eyes of next year's freshmen it will seem
as established and unsurprising as the Main Quad, just as the
red-bow-tied Vice Provost for Student Affairs James Montoya
seems a campus fixture to vou, even though he only started his

job in Casper's first year.
Instead, think of Stanford Introductory Seminars, the
small, tightly-knit classes for freshman or sophomores taught
by the sort of renowned professors that would regularly be
found behind podiums, lecturing to graduate students. Think
of Jacques Derrida and Harold Bloom delivering commis
sioned lectures as part of an ongoing symposium on the future
of the humanities — and participating in sit-down discussions
afterwards. Think of Sophomore College, arriving early at
Stanford, late in the summer, and joining in the kind of daily,
intensive studies and discussions with professors that most peo
ple associate with small, liberal arts colleges like Amherst rather
than major research universities. (A few of you: think of the
President's Scholars program and feel very, very grateful for
thousands of research dollars before your junior year. The rest
of you: hate them.) You would have experienced none of these
programs, the academic high points in many students' Stan
ford careers, had you graduated in or before 1992.
fn the early '90s, Stanford simply had more important
things to worry about than drastically overhauling undergrad
uate education. Another kind of overhaul was already being
forced upon the University's students and faculty. Rather than
trying to advance the undergraduate program, the University
struggled to protect it as much as possible from a $40 million
budget cutback necessitated in part by reduced research fund
ing from the federal government. Despite the fiscal up
heaval, University President Donald Kenneth began initiating
programs to improve undergraduate education at the end of
his tenure. At the time, media coverage had begun to draw at
tention to the widespread impression among educators and
the public at large that undergraduate education nation-wide
was suffering due to an overemphasis on facultv research. In
1991, the indirect cost controversy still in full swing. Kennech
set aside $7 million lor undergraduate teaching initiatives, such
as financial rewards for outstanding teachers.
Casper said in a recent interview with The Weekly that his
concern lor undergraduate education grew out of his univer
sity experience at I lamburg, where he received a law degree in
1961. Enrolled in a packed course in which the lecturer literal
ly lectured, in the Latin sense, solely reading from a prepared
manuscript, Casper was so dissatisfied that lie considered
dropping out. It was not what he felt an education should be.
"I've always said that negative role models can be just as im
portant as positive ones," Casper said.

Thankfully, he gave the university another chance and
found an advanced-degree seminar that involved discussion
and close contact with the professor, exactly the sort of course
he has promoted at Stanford. Apparently tlit- experience re
newed his faith in university education, as he went on to ac
quire a master of laws degree from Yale ('62), a doctorate from
the University of Freiburg ('64) and teaching positions ai I (1-
Berkeley, the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium and
the University of Chicago before arriving on the Farm in 1992.
112 1 is (lommission on Undergraduate Fducation, the findings of
which led to main of his undergraduate innovations at Stan
lord, arrived in 1995.
Looking to the future, Provost |olm Henness\ has ex
pressed interest in expanding Casper's innovations to the sec -
ond two undergraduate years. It seems that with am link
things will only get better.


KEITH ITO/The Stanford
Casper steps down this September after eight years as president,
Then and now
Few people would have predict
ed the rosy end-of-the-century glow
at Stanford when Casper took office
in 1992. It is difficult to reconcile the
tone and atmosphere of the Univer
sity then and now, only eight years
later. Imagine opening The Daily to
find news of cutbacks, cost battles
and disgruntled students rather
than expansion, start ups and heat
ed ASSU elections. Imagine Casper
stepping down in the hopes of end
ing "confusion and doubt inside the
Stanford family," as Kennedy wrote
in liis July 1991 letter of resignation.
Imagine The Daily writing in the an
nouncement of Hennessy's selec
tion, "Higher education is strug
gling fiscally, losing federal research
support and facing a crisis in public
trust," as it did when Casper was se
lected in March 1992.
I n one way or another, Stanford's
sense of well-being hinges on its fi
nances. There would be no contro
versies over graduate housing or
funding for Chicano Studies if the
University had an unlimited bank
account, but as Casper has often re
peated and the numbers confirm,
Stanford's endowment simply is not
as large as people think it is: a mere
$6.2 billion as of April, versus, for ex
ample, Harvard's $14.3 billion. As
recently as 1997, Stanford's endow
ment-per-student ranked 17th
among American universities.
The University's well-being took
two sharp dives before its 1991 cen
tennial, first from the $ 160 million of
damage caused by the 1989 Loma
Prieta earthquake and second from
the indirect cost controversy, which
erupted shortly before autumn
quarter 1990. Stanford became a
scapegoat for the national media,
and Kennedy was grilled by a con
gressional committee over confu
sion in the federal government's sys
tem of reimbursing overhead ("indi
rect") costs for basic science research
at universities.
The Stanford yacht Victoria,
whose depreciation had been
charged to the federal government
as overhead, became an icon for
pundits and political cartoonists na
tion-wide. In the wake of the contro
versy, Stanford's rate of reimburse
ment was drastically reduced — no
small matter lor a university that first
rose to national prominence as a re
sult of Cold War research funding
and relies to this day on federal sup
port for over a third of its operating
budget. Despite a more than suc
cessful $1.1 billion centennial
fundraising campaign, the largest
ever attempted by a university at the
time, Stanford found itself faced
with a S4O million deficit in its oper
ating budget, and (he future of its fi
nances looked even more bleak.
To balance the operating budget,
the administration ordered a 10

percent reduction in the Universi
ty's operating costs, and the Board
of Trustees called for a 9.5 percent
raise in undergraduate tuition. The
1992-93 year brought the smallest
faculty pay increase in 20 years, only
2 percent. Applications began to
drop while rising at other universi
ties. Even those accepted to Stanford
seemed wary: by 1993, eight out of
10 applicants accepted to both Stan
ford and Harvard chose the Crim
son over the Cardinal. An overseas
campus in Salamanca, Spain was dis
mantled. Some enrolled students
feared that their majors might not
be around when they graduated.
In 1992, people expected Stan
ford to emerge from its cutbacks
leaner, calmer, tougher and proba
bly in some sense better, but few if
any anticipated a truly stronger,
larger, more ambitious and robust
university. Yet that is exactly what
Stanford is today.
The University spent nearly $1
billion restoring and constructing
new facilities during the '90s and
plans to build more than twice as
much in the next decade, more de
velopment than in any decade of its
history. Casper has raised donations
to $300 million annually. The num
ber offreshman applications and the
yield rate of accepted students who
choose Stanford have hit all-time
highs. The University is a five-time
Sears Cup champion and can prob
ably expect to continue its streak
until the cup changes criteria for
judging.
Even minority faculty and affir
mative action controversies seem
for the most part to have fizzled in
the breezy contentment of late-'9os
Stanford. Casper made every effort
to ensure that Stanford's internal
squabbles would no longer provide
material for the national media.
With a characteristic lack of fanfare,
Stanford's indirect cost controversy
dissolved itself. It is widely acknowl
edged now that Stanford's account
ing practices at the time were not
substantially different from other
universities'. After the University
paid $3.5 million back to the gov
ernment, much less than the $200
million that was originally alleged,
the federal Office of Naval Research
stated that it had found no evidence
of "fraud, misrepresentation or
other wrongdoing." Stanford
ended up paying far more in legal
and accounting lees — nearly $40
million — than it ever paid in reim
bursement.
How did the University lift itself
from the dark days of the earl) '90s
to where it is now? The answer lies in
a survey of some of the campus'
more recent additions: buildings
dedicated to .'Mien, Gates, Hewlett,
Packard and Clark. Stanford was
built with railroad money and made
great with help from federal funds.
It is what it is today thanks to invest
ment from the private industries of
Silicon Valley.
The turn in Stanford's fortunes
was gradual, but a representative
moment arrived in 1996, when then

Provost Condoleezza Rice an
nounced that an expected $7 million
budgetary cut was being scaled back
to $3.1 million. The massive cuts in
science funding promised by the
anti-Big Government GOP Con
gress of 1994 never really material
ized, though there was a slight drop.
Rice's announcement brought a
premature end to a controversial
$20 million round of cuts initiated
after the $40 million cutback was
completed in 1992. In 1996, the
University found that rather than
facing a deficit, it was sporting a $ 15
million surplus.
Not only has the University re
turned to its usual good spirits, but it
has come to embody the ethos of a
cultural moment, for better or
worse. As former Daily reporter Ro
mesh Ratnesar, class of 1995, wrote
in a recent Time article on Stanford
runaway Tiger Woods, today in
America is "an era defined by placid
prosperity and cross-cultural, NAS
DAQ-obsessed Generation Y geeks
who went to Stanford."
Sad, but true.
The talented Dr. Casper
One of the greatest ironies of the
1990's Stanford renaissance is that
while the University's ambitiously
laid-back, ambivalently intelligent
style came to dominate the tech-cul
ture landscape, the University itself
was led by a man with a decidedly
different style: witty, deadpan, intel
lectual, precise. He says he used to
read "War & Peace" every two years
or so before the presidency and has
been greatly influenced in his life by
"Henri Quatre," a novel by Thomas
Mann's brother Heinrich. A Stan
lord magazine article notes that he is
prone to quoting Goethe, Mon
taigne and Henry Adams.
Even his speaking style seems
carefully modulated and formed.
He says he receives no gratification
from the power of the presidency
and will not miss being quoted and
having his words published. In a let
ter to Ted Koppel in 1998, Casper
described the difficulty of maintain
ing a sphere of personal privacy as
Stanford president: "I was reluctant
to answer endless questions about
my private life in a culture that has
come to equate reticence with stand
offishness or worse."
As an organizer and chair of sev
eral architectural competitions for
new campus buildings, Casper
helped insure that Stanford's in
tense development in the past few
years was matched by an equally in
tense mindfulness of aesthetics. He
once lamented the low turnout of
Stanford students at the recently re
opened Cantor Center for the Visu
al Arts, and he noted that architec
ture is the one form of art that can
not be avoided.
Always reminding students of
their ties to the intellectual life of
the past, Casper included in his
first commencement speech,
about a University's "first days," a
lengthy, carefully crafted medita

tion on the Stanford motto, "Die
Luft der Freiheit weht" (the wind
of freedom blows). It was as if he
wrote his addresses as a single
work when he rounded off his
final speech, at the 2000 convoca
tion, with an invocation of "last
days," both for graduates and for
his presidency.
Born Christmas day, 1937 in
the port city of Hamburg, Ger
many, Casper was raised in the
shadow of World War 11. It seems
that freedom has played a central
role in his outlook ever since —
his celebration of the Stanford
motto being only one example. A
highly regarded constitutional
law scholar and emeritus editor of
the Supreme Court Review, he is
rumored to carry a well-thumbed
copy of the U.S. Constitution in
his breast pocket and once co-au
thored a book with eclectic liber
tarian Richard Posner, the con
troversial chief judge of the Unit
ed States Court of Appeals who
ruled that nude dancing is a form
of expression protected by the
First Amendment and who favors
the legalization of marijuana.
In an interview with Stanford
magazine, Casper singled out a
1995 Santa Clara County Superior
Court ruling Stanford's "hate
speech" policy unconstitutional as
one subject he wishes he'd taken a
stronger stand on during his pres
idency. He said he was ambivalent
about the hate speech policy itself,
and "would have preferred the
harsh wind of freedom." But he re
jected the notion that government
could take away a university's free
dom to regulate its students'
speech. In the end lit' decided not
to appeal the ruling, partlv to
avoid negative press lor Stanford.
"Universities have to ask wh.it
they want in their presidents," he

told The Daily in 1993. "11" they
want a person who shows up in
every corner and gives speeches
in every corner, that is one model.
But if they want a president who
worries about the substance of the
academic enterprise (hen they
have to reduce their demands.
The two cannot be reconciled."
Casper has served his eight
years as a model of the latter type
while never neglecting the per
sonal interaction with students
that he has said he enjoys so much
in teaching. His bedtime stories,
guest spots in Gaieties, tea and
cookies gatherings and presence
at a basketball game with the
Sixth Man Club testify to a contin
ual and largely successful effort to
overcome any barriers that might
have resulted from his arriving at
Stanford as an "outsider."
Shortly after Casper's selec
tion as president, Jean Fetter, the
executive vice chair of the search
committee, responded to a Daily
reporter's question about
whether Casper's having come
from the "more traditional" Uni
versity of Chicago might affect
Stanford's commitment to diver
sity. "If Stanford can't cope with
someone very different coming
in," she said, "it's not living up to
its own values."
Casper's "difference," often
exaggerated and yet in some
sense real, has in countless ways
benefited Stanford through a
particular diversity that an out
side observer might say the Uni
versity tends to neglect: the di
versity of style, of fashion.
Thanks to Casper's style, as well
as his expert guidance, subtle
leadership and stream of innova
tions, Stanford should be a
stronger and more thoughtful in
stitution for years to come.
