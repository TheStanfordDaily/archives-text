## The
						Stanford Renaissance: A final look at the Casper years 
### GREG BRAZEAL EDITORIAL STAFF 
A university education does not lend itself to students hav
ing a sense of their university's past. The student body remains
perpetually young, and its collective memory hardly stretches
back four years. Vou come to a school to learn from it, end up
spending a tew years finding your way through it, and if by ac
cident or catastrophe you somehow manage to catch a glimpse
of (he way it was before you, that glimpse probably arrives more
or less as you pack your bags to leave.
This is especially the case if you arrived at Stanford in the
final years of University President Gerhard Casper's tenure.
The late '90s were calm except for the occasional rain storm,
prosperous except for a single unfortunate hospital merger,
upbeat and cheery unless you were a homeless graduate stu
dent — and it was only a matter of time before that problem
was remedied as well. Now and then you heard the cloudy
term "indirect cost," usually followed by the word "controver
sy," but you shrugged off both with a smile and returned to
playing Frisbee. ft seemed that things had always been this way
on the Farm and always would be, only better.
The Unbearable Lightness of Graduation
The point is not that most students are unaware that Tres
sider and Wilbur were once presidents, just like C lasper, or that
Stanford was a fairly unremarkable undergraduate college be
fbre World War 11, little recognized outside (lalifornia or even
that late in the '80s Stanford was number one in the U.S. News
&: World Report college rankings that it now so vocally ignores:
the point is that it is difficult for a student to realize how much
difference eight years, like the eight years of Casper's presi
dency, can make to their undergraduate experiences.
Set aside AXESS, which did not debut until 1992, and be
fore which people registered for classes by waiting in notori
ously long lines at the Registrar's office. Set aside the Stanford
in-Moscow campus, launched in 1993. Set aside the renovated
Bing Wing and the Cantor Arts Center and the Science En
gineering Quad, which you probably still think of as new,
though of course in the eyes of next year's freshmen it will seem
as established and unsurprising as the Main Quad, just as the
red-bow-tied Vice Provost for Student Affairs James Montoya
seems a campus fixture to vou, even though he only started his

job in Casper's first year.
Instead, think of Stanford Introductory Seminars, the
small, tightly-knit classes for freshman or sophomores taught
by the sort of renowned professors that would regularly be
found behind podiums, lecturing to graduate students. Think
of Jacques Derrida and Harold Bloom delivering commis
sioned lectures as part of an ongoing symposium on the future
of the humanities — and participating in sit-down discussions
afterwards. Think of Sophomore College, arriving early at
Stanford, late in the summer, and joining in the kind of daily,
intensive studies and discussions with professors that most peo
ple associate with small, liberal arts colleges like Amherst rather
than major research universities. (A few of you: think of the
President's Scholars program and feel very, very grateful for
thousands of research dollars before your junior year. The rest
of you: hate them.) You would have experienced none of these
programs, the academic high points in many students' Stan
ford careers, had you graduated in or before 1992.
fn the early '90s, Stanford simply had more important
things to worry about than drastically overhauling undergrad
uate education. Another kind of overhaul was already being
forced upon the University's students and faculty. Rather than
trying to advance the undergraduate program, the University
struggled to protect it as much as possible from a $40 million
budget cutback necessitated in part by reduced research fund
ing from the federal government. Despite the fiscal up
heaval, University President Donald Kenneth began initiating
programs to improve undergraduate education at the end of
his tenure. At the time, media coverage had begun to draw at
tention to the widespread impression among educators and
the public at large that undergraduate education nation-wide
was suffering due to an overemphasis on facultv research. In
1991, the indirect cost controversy still in full swing. Kennech
set aside $7 million lor undergraduate teaching initiatives, such
as financial rewards for outstanding teachers.
Casper said in a recent interview with The Weekly that his
concern lor undergraduate education grew out of his univer
sity experience at I lamburg, where he received a law degree in
1961. Enrolled in a packed course in which the lecturer literal
ly lectured, in the Latin sense, solely reading from a prepared
manuscript, Casper was so dissatisfied that lie considered
dropping out. It was not what he felt an education should be.
"I've always said that negative role models can be just as im
portant as positive ones," Casper said.

Thankfully, he gave the university another chance and
found an advanced-degree seminar that involved discussion
and close contact with the professor, exactly the sort of course
he has promoted at Stanford. Apparently tlit- experience re
newed his faith in university education, as he went on to ac
quire a master of laws degree from Yale ('62), a doctorate from
the University of Freiburg ('64) and teaching positions ai I (1-
Berkeley, the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium and
the University of Chicago before arriving on the Farm in 1992.
112 1 is (lommission on Undergraduate Fducation, the findings of
which led to main of his undergraduate innovations at Stan
lord, arrived in 1995.
Looking to the future, Provost |olm Henness\ has ex
pressed interest in expanding Casper's innovations to the sec -
ond two undergraduate years. It seems that with am link
things will only get better.
