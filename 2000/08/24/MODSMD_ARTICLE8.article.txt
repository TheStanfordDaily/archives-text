# Search for Medical School dean may end soon

### BILL FALSEY EDITORIAL STAFF 
When University President Gerhard
Casper called for a search committee to lind ;i
dean lor the School of Medicine last January,
he intended on receiving a candidate recom
mendation before winter's end. Nine months
later, with the end of Casper's term rapidly ap
proaching, the search committee has still not
produced a recommendation.
But it may soon. Dr. Stephen Galli, profes
sor and chair of pathology, who co-chairs the
search committee along with soon-to-be presi
dent John Hennessy, says the committee "is
working toward a Sept. 1 deadline and expects
to meet that schedule."
Should Casper see a recommendation, it
would he a fitting conclusion to the rather an
fractuous process he set into motion six years
ago.
In February of 1995, Casper called for a
restructuring of the Stanford Medical Center

and named then dermatology chair Dr. Eu
gene Bauer to the position of dean of the
Medical School. At that time, Casper revealed
that he had initiated a search committee the
previous year to lind. what he termed, a vice
president for medical affairs. Splitting the
roles of dean and vice president had become
necessary, in Casper's view, because of the
growing difficulty and distinctiveness of the
two jobs. The dean would function as a chief
academic officer while the vice president
would more closely control the clinical oper
ations of the facility.
The search for a vice president was put on
hold, however, after the ill-fated Stanford-
UCSF Health Care merger came online. The
vice president position remained vacant for
two years while Capser dealt with the medical
center's concerns as a type of de facto vice
president.
Reflecting on the situation in 1997, Casper
told the Faculty Senate, "I suspended my
search for a vice president for medical affairs as

everything else was in suspense and I had no
time left to worry about the vice president po
sition, however much I wanted somebody
other than myself to lill it."
It was never an idyllic arrangement, and at
that same venue three years ago, Casper an
nounced that after having resumed his search
and taking "exactly one minute of reflection"
that he had decided to name Bauer to the vice
presidential position â€” meaning that Bauer
would be both dean and vice president of the
Medical School.
And so, for three years, that is how the Med
ical Center's leadership positions were filled.
But last fall, when, after much consterna
tion, the Stanford-UCSF merger was ended,
the need for change was once again realized.
As the Medical Center regained its pre-merg
er autonomy, it was decided to return to the
original 1994 restructuring scheme.
Thus, in January of this year, while Bauer
