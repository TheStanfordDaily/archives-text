# Search for Medical School dean may end soon
## 
### BILL FALSEY EDITORIAL STAFF 
When University President Gerhard
Casper called for a search committee to lind ;i
dean lor the School of Medicine last January,
he intended on receiving a candidate recom
mendation before winter's end. Nine months
later, with the end of Casper's term rapidly ap
proaching, the search committee has still not
produced a recommendation.
But it may soon. Dr. Stephen Galli, profes
sor and chair of pathology, who co-chairs the
search committee along with soon-to-be presi
dent John Hennessy, says the committee "is
working toward a Sept. 1 deadline and expects
to meet that schedule."
Should Casper see a recommendation, it
would he a fitting conclusion to the rather an
fractuous process he set into motion six years
ago.
In February of 1995, Casper called for a
restructuring of the Stanford Medical Center

and named then dermatology chair Dr. Eu
gene Bauer to the position of dean of the
Medical School. At that time, Casper revealed
that he had initiated a search committee the
previous year to lind. what he termed, a vice
president for medical affairs. Splitting the
roles of dean and vice president had become
necessary, in Casper's view, because of the
growing difficulty and distinctiveness of the
two jobs. The dean would function as a chief
academic officer while the vice president
would more closely control the clinical oper
ations of the facility.
The search for a vice president was put on
hold, however, after the ill-fated Stanford-
UCSF Health Care merger came online. The
vice president position remained vacant for
two years while Capser dealt with the medical
center's concerns as a type of de facto vice
president.
Reflecting on the situation in 1997, Casper
told the Faculty Senate, "I suspended my
search for a vice president for medical affairs as

everything else was in suspense and I had no
time left to worry about the vice president po
sition, however much I wanted somebody
other than myself to lill it."
It was never an idyllic arrangement, and at
that same venue three years ago, Casper an
nounced that after having resumed his search
and taking "exactly one minute of reflection"
that he had decided to name Bauer to the vice
presidential position â€” meaning that Bauer
would be both dean and vice president of the
Medical School.
And so, for three years, that is how the Med
ical Center's leadership positions were filled.
But last fall, when, after much consterna
tion, the Stanford-UCSF merger was ended,
the need for change was once again realized.
As the Medical Center regained its pre-merg
er autonomy, it was decided to return to the
original 1994 restructuring scheme.
Thus, in January of this year, while Bauer

dropped the vice president of medical affairs title
to become vice president of the Medical Center,
Casper instructed Hennessy to construct a
search committee to produce a candidate to re
lieve Bauer of his dean post. Casper's winter call,
and his accompanying one-month deadline, re
sulted in the committee which is still operating
today.
Returning to the restructuring scheme was a
widelv supported move. At the time, Hennessy
found that, "The job that Gene [Bauer] is cur
rently trying to do is too big for one person,'' and
for his part, Bauer himself reported spending al
most 100 percent of his time on clinical issues.
That left Bauer with little time for academics,
though he pledged to stay on as dean until a new
one might be found.
Casper's one-month deadline for the search
committee was rather quickly extended as it be
came clear that no thorough evaluation of the
more than 100 candidates for the position could
be interviewed in that time frame. Instead, it was
decided that the short list of candidate names
would be prepared for the April 15 Board of
Trustees meeting.
But, as the committee held town meetings
and solicited faculty input, April 15 came and
went, as did June's Commencement ceremonies,
which Hennessy picked as a revised target date
for the search committee to present its findings.
Ai id that brings the story to date; almost nine

months have passed and Bauer is still operating
as both dean and vice president. What has
caused the committee's search to become so
protracted?
(ialli challenges the notion that the com
mittee has delayed and argues that the scope
of the search itself demanded has a nine
month effort.
"Many faculty (both those on the committee
and others) felt that the initial timeline was ex
tremely ambitious. Over 110 proposed candi
dates were screened and initial visits with the
search committee were arranged for 10 indi
viduals, all of whom are very busy and have
complicated travel schedules. Taken together
with the difficult schedules of key individuals
involved in the interview process, such as Pres
ident-elect Hennessy, Dean Bauer, the CEOs of
the Stanford Hospital, Clinics and the Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital, key chairs, senior
associate deans. . . one can easily imagine how
challenging it was to arrange the initial evalua
tions of If) candidates and the additional inter
views with all of the finalists."
Yet, some might question the wisdom of al
lowing the post-merger Medical Center to oper
ate for nine months with an admittedly over
taxed leadership.
"Obviously sooner is better," said Hennessy,
"but the committee decided, with strong input
from the faculty, that finding the right candidate
was most important objective. Thus, we decided
to sacrifice speed for a high quality result."
(ialli agrees: "I think that most faculty and
students would agree that the choice of the next
dean of the School of Medicine is important

enough to require a full, thorough and open
search. Whether the ultimate choice is an ex
ternal or internal candidate, the new dean's
ability to succeed in this challenging position
will only he strengthened if' the faculty and stu
dents know that the process used to select this
individual was well-considered, properly exe
cuted, and robust. While all involved in this
process would like the new dean to be named
and start work as soon as is practical, 1 believe
that most of the faculty and students will un
derstand why the process took longer than ini
tially had been proposed."
And Bauer seems satisfied with the commit
tee's efforts. Speaking through James Robin
son, the acting director of the Office for News
and Public affairs at the Medical Center,
Bauer affirmed that the Medical Center is
functioning without any substantial harm as
the search continues.
"The School's needs are being managed as
before by my continuing as dean," he noted.
He admitted, t hough, that he looks forward "to
an expeditious transition as soon as the search
committee offers its report and a new dean is
appointed."
In any case, any remaining doubts regard
ing the wisdom of this approach may quickly
become moot if Galli's prediction of a Sept. 1
result comes to fruition. Once a candidate has
been selected by the committee, there may be
some need for additional "thoughtful discus
sion and deliberation," but Galli seems opti
mistic that the search will be over soon and that
the Medical School could have a new dean in
only a matter of weeks.
