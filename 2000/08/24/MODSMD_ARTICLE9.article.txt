# NO gas linked to fertilization
## 
### HELEN KWAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
David Epel, professor of biological sci
ences at the I lopkins Marine Station, has led
his team to a major discovery in sexual re
production.
Sexual reproduction, found in almost all
organisms, requires specialized cells: sperm
and egg. A fertilized egg, the single cell that
results from sperm implantation, contains
the program and genetic instructions to form
an embryo. Somehow, the contact of sperm
and egg starts off this program and initiates
development. What happens during this
contact has been a source of wonder to scien
tists for decades.
Epel and his colleagues have been utiliz
ing sea urchin gametes as an animal model
to understand the mystery of fertilization
since the 19705. His group had shown that
an increase of free calcium occurs at fertiliza
tion and that this is the singular trigger that
starts the events leading to the formation of
an embryo.
What causes the build-up of calcium had
remained unknown until Epel's group's re
cent discovery: the group found that the
build-up of nitric oxide (NO) gas inside the
fertilizing sperm ultimately promotes the re
lease of calcium in the newly-fertilized egg.
NO gas is produced by an enzyme, a pro
tein molecule, called nitric oxide synthase
(NOS) that is present in sea urchin sperm.
NOS is inactive until a few seconds before fer
tilization. When the sperm is in close prox
imity to an egg, NOS produces a large
amount of NO in the sperm and when the
sperm fuses with the egg this NO then trig
gers the release of the critical free calcium.
This increase of free calcium stimulates the

forma lion of additional NO from NOS. NO
thai causes the release of more free calcium
and it is this loop that initiates metabolic
changes and other physiok >gic al responses to
complete the process of fertilization.
Epel's group is now actively investigating
the levels of NO during fertilization in the
eggs of other animal species, including cows
and mice. Since the known calcium increase
occurs in all animal eggs during fertilization,
including human eggs, Epel predicts that it
is likely that they will detect a corresponding
increase of NO concentration across the
kingdom.
If Epel's prediction is correct, NO could
become a useful tool in genetic engineering,
cloning and in treating infertility.
Over the past few years, NO has gained
considerable attention and notoriety in both
the medical community and the public do
main. Nitric Oxide is known to play an im
portant role in blood pressure regulation,
neural transmissions, and in anti-microbial
defense mechanisms. Of course, more wide
spread fame came to NO after it was shown
that its blood pressure regulating capacities
indirecdy govern the changes necessary for
penile erection and knowledge of this process
led to the subsequent development of the
erectile dysfunction treatment, Viagra.
The work of Epel's group was published
in the Aug. 10 issue of the journal Nature.
