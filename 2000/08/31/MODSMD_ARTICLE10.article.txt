# Stanford West units to open on Oct. 1
## 
### SARAH MEARON 
On Oct. 1, Stanford West will
follow the Escondiclo Village stu
dio apartments as the second hous
ing complex to open this year on
University land.
Billed as a "628-unit residential
community . . . designed to simpli
fy life," according to the official
Website (stanfordwest.Stanford,
edu), Stanford West is designated
for occupancy by faculty, staff and
other employees who work on
Stanford land. It will include a fit
ness center, a child care center, two
pools and will be accessible by the
Marguerite shuttle.
Charles Carter, a planner / ar
chitect with the UA 8c Planning Of
fice, said, "We all know how hard it
is to afford housing in Palo Alto.
[Stanford West] is a significant ad
dition to the housing situation in
Palo Alto. The fact that it's a prior
ity to Stanford employees means
that it is close to the workplace and
will cut down on auto travel."
Stanford West is one of the four
Sand Hill Road Projects being un
dertaken by the Stanford Manage
ment Company (SMC). As early as
the 19705, discussions began re
volving around Sand Hill corridor
land use and transportation issues.
In 1992, Stanford came forward
with four development projects,

which also include a senior housing
project, an expansion of Stanford
Shopping Center and a widening
ol Sand Hill Road to four lanes
from Santa Cruz Avenue to El
("amino Real.
"It's heart-warming to see the
interest and response [of prospec
tive tenants]... to see that they'll
have a nice place to live," said Carol
Sargent, Director of Faculty / Staff
Housing, ol the new housing com
plex. "It's a measure that the Uni
versity is making an effort."
Currently, just under 200 hous
ing applications have been submit
ted for occupancy at Stanford
West.
With the Silicon Valley econo
my not showing any signs of slow
ing down, the construction of Stan
ford West has quickly become a
timely project. Construction of the
complex began in the fall of 1999,
and the first 60 units will be avail
able for move-in between Oct. 1
and Nov. 1 of this year. Additional
blocks of apartments will open
every six to eight weeks, and the
complex should be at full occupan
cy within a year.
"[The housing market] is hav
ing a really adverse impact on
being able to recruit the caliber of
faculty that Stanford is accus
tomed to. I've had people say that
they simply can't afford to move to

the area because of housing prices,
said Sargent.
Scott Fendorf, an assistant pro
lessor in the Department of Geo
logical and Environmental Sci
ences, said that the Bay Area hous
ing market was a major factor he
had to consider when he came to
Stanford from the University of
Idaho in January of last year.
"The number one concern was
housing, and it's just gotten worse.
It went from being really, really,
really bad to being completely im
possible," he said.
"We're in a house right now, so
it's not a problem," Fendorf said.
"But if we were just moving to the
area, we would consider [Stanford
West]."
Fendorf is concerned as to
where his family will move when
they have more children. He and
his wife currently have a one year
old son and live in a small house in
Menlo Park.
"When the time comes, we
won't be able to stay where we're at.
It's going to be a big challenge. I
look around and it scares me," he
said.
First priority for the Stanford
West units goes to University facul
ty, University public safety officers
and staff, including post-doctoral
fellows and SLAC employees, who
work at least 30 hours a week. Sec-

ond priority goes
to hospital and
clinic employees,
medical residents
and interns, visit
ing scholars and
finally, to people
who work on
Stanford lands,
including the re
search park,
Welch Road and
the shopping cen
ter. If there are
unoccupied units
following the as
signment of these
two groups, they
will be rented to
the general
community.
According to
Carter, "It was a
requirement with
the city of Palo
Alto that we make
it a priority to
house Stanford
personnel."
In fact, the
Palo Alto com-

munity was intimately involved
with the planning of the Sand Hill
Road Projects. Several public re
views and meetings were held in
the mid-1990s to gather input
from the community, culminating

in the distribution of an Environ
mental Impact Report in June
1996.
Rents at Stanford West will
range from $ 1,470 to $ 1,930 for a

one-bedroom apartment and from
$2,890 to $3,180 for a three-bed
room apartment.
"They're relatively expensive,"
said Sargent. " That's a difficult fact
of life in this area. Many people
feel that the amenities make it
worth it. At least [the units] are
substantially reduced over the sur
rounding area."
Furthermore, 10 percent of the
units will be initially offered at
Below Market Rent (BMR), which
will range from $794 for a one
bedroom unit to $1,345 for a
three-bedroom unit. According to
Sargent, within about 15 years, 25
percent of the units will be at BMR.
"The BMR units are extremely
attractive," said Sargent.
Fendorf agreed. But he wished
the University would go a step fur
ther. "I would like to see the BMR
units up to 50 percent of the
homes. I mean, that would at least
make a dent," he said.
"The big challenge 1 face is
bringing [graduate students and
post-docs] in," Fendorf said. "Re
cruiting single graduate students
is not a problem because they are
guaranteed housing for their first
year. Post-docs are more mature
and many have families and are re

ally in a predicament. As a post
doc, $40,000 is on the higher side
of the pay scale."
In order to qualify for a BMR
apartment, annual household in
come must be less than $48,700 for
a one-person household and less
than $69,600 for a four-person
household.
"I think that it's good that
they're building some sort of hous
ing for post-docs," said Mark Brei
denbach, a graduate student in
Molecular and Cellular Physiolo
gy. "They are really struggling to
find housing right now."
Breidenbach recently moved to
Stanford with his entire research
group from Yale and was lucky
enough to be assigned on-campus
housing through the waiting list.
"1 got my Escondido Village
apartment, so I'm happy," Brei
denbach said. "But I'm disturbed
that I may have to move out next
year. On a grad student salary, you
can't pay these $1,700 a month
rents."
Although graduate students are
not in either of the priority groups
for assignment to Stanford West,
about 500 new graduate units
were added to the on-campus
housing pool this year with the
construction of the Escondido Vil
lage studio apartments.
"I think the studios are great,
but if they built another 500,
maybe then that would be

enough," said Breidenbach.
About 3,650 graduate students
currently live on campus, which
leaves about 5,500 students to fend
for themselves in the Bay Area
housing market.
"What makes Stanford great is
its students, faculty and staff, and
we have to respond as fast as we
can to each group," said Sargent of
the University's approach to the
housing problem.
According to the Graduate Stu
dent Council's Graduate Housing
Report, the median income for
Stanford graduate students is less
than $20,000, which is almost
$30,000 less than the median in
come of people in Santa Clara
county.
Breidenbach described the prob
lems the fifth-year students in his
group were having in terms of find
ing affordable housing in the area.
"They're fifth year, so they're
not guaranteed [on-campus] hous
ing," he said. "They get paid grad
student salaries, and they're com
peting with Silicon Valley people
for housing. It's unfortunate for
them."
Unless the Silicon Valley econo
my slows down in the near future,
the odds of finding affordable
housing in the area will continue to
be next to impossible.
"You might as well go play the
lotto. You have the same probabil
ity," said Fendorf.
