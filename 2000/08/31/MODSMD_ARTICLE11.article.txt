# Incoming freshmen eager-for their arrival in September
## 
### JEFFREY TAM 
Over I ,(>OO freshmen. All strand
ed on campus without cars, l he
highest yield rate ever (07 percent).
These are some of the descriptions
that can he used for the incoming
('.lass of 2004. On Friday, Sept. 22,
ihey will descend on Stanford's dor
mitories, and the echoes of resident
assistants' screaming mispro
nounced or misidentilied names will
he ringing across the campus.
So what's different about this
year's round of incoming freshmen?
For one thing, this will he the first
class of freshmen to listen to an
Opening Convocation delivered by
John Hennessy, who is replacing
Gerhard Casper as University presi
dent after eight years at the helm.
For another, school parking policy
has changed. Due to the land crunch
that Stanford has experienced dur
ing the last few years, freshmen may
no longer park on campus.
But at the Stanford Summer En
gineering Academy (SSEA) in the
Enchanted Broccoli Forest, where

incoming minority freshmen who
are looking to major in engineering
were attending a summer camp to
brush up on advanced math and sci
ence skills, parking did not appear to
be a problem lor most people.
Very few of the freshmen seemed
to be concerned about it, though one
freshman there, Marcus Flagg, a
prospective mechanical engineering
major, did say he needs to drive in
order to attend Air Force ROTC
training at San Jose State University.
Because he is coming to Stanford on
an Air Force ROTC. scholarship, he
believes that he is entitled to a waiver
and has applied to the Review Com
mittee for Frosh Parking to get one.
Otherwise, the anxiousness that
many of the incoming freshmen feel
makes this class no different than
previous ones. Dandre DeSandies,
associate director of the Undergrad
uate Advising Center, said that, "We
had a huge slurry of calls from the in
coming students right when forms
were due, their questions ranging
from what's the best I HUM to
whether you can choose your room

mate to questions on requirements
and credit transfer."
But DeSandies, who has been ad
vising undergraduates at Stanford
since 1987, stated that the questions
were mostly prett\ typical and not
much different front previous years,
though he did have one parent call
and ask him whether she should buy
an expensive stereo for her child to
bring to college.
Joe Narens, senior coordinator
for the New Undergraduate Student
Information Project (Nl SIP) and a
junior majoring in industrial engi
neering, also thought that questions
have been fairly typical. He's gotten
"some academic questions like how to
sign up for classes," as well as a lot of
questions on what to bring to college,
at the rate of around seyen to eight
calls an hour. Narens mentioned that
there have not been too many ques
tion's from the incoming freshmen
about die new parking policy.
The incomingwho attended the
SSEA program are, as is to be ex
pected, excited to be coming to Stan
ford. Jennifer Gallegos, an incoming

freshman, said that she wanted to
"meet new people and see new faces'
and that she appreciated having the
opportunity to live in Casa Zapata,
where, "I'll be able to adjust easier
with people I'm comfortable with,
then expand and integrate into the
Stanford community."
She also has high goals, explain
ing that she wanted to "hopefully
come out of Stanford majoring in
civil engineering and minoring in
English with a 3.5 GPA." When
asked about how she lelt as a minori
ty woman majoring in engineering,
she responded that, "Ifs a little in
timidating but keeps me determined
because it represents who I am and
where I come from."
Mike Roberts, another incoming
freshman, also already knows what
he's going to be doing in the next
four years. He stated emphatically,
"I'm going to major in computer sys
tems engineering and possibly co
term in computer science."
As idealistic and energetic as these
freshmen are, the)' also seemed to be
somewhat clueless about some basic

school (acts. Several knew that Hen
nessv used to he a professor in the
Electrical Engineering Department
hut did not actually know his name.
When asked about Casper, Roberts
stated, "Yeah, he's the white-haired
guy we met at Admit Weekend."
When the Class 0f2004 arrives in
late September, half of them will sav
they're "pre-med" majors, and most
of them will have trouble finding lo
cations of classes in the Main Quad.
But they will certainly be bringing an
element of change to a campus that
many would say settles in on itscll
through the course of each school
year.
Donielle Newell, an incoming
freshman who participated in SSKA,
stated that she "expected to hopeful
ly be challenged academicalh, social
ly and in extracurricular activities"
and that she was hoping to do an in
dividually designed major in bio-en
gineering while fulfilling pre-med re
quirements. But her most burning
question was whether "Stanford stu
dents are that happy, as happv as 1
saw during Pro Fro weekend."
