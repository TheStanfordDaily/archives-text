## EDITOR'S NOTEBOOK 'Surviving' the summer 
### KIMBERLY DOWNS 
Most people spent their
Wednesday evenings this sum
mer glued to the television watch
ing "Survivor," but I spent them
glued to a chair in The Daily of
fice proofreading paper copies of
The Weekly which would appear
in print the next day.
I couldn't tell you the name of
the island where the show was
filmed or the names of the people
battling the elements and one an
other to "survive" on it, but ask
me what areas of Stanford's Gen
eral Use Permit are under scruti
ny or which current and former
Stanford athletes are heading to
Sydney in a couple of weeks and I
could prattle on for a while.
There were times on those
Wednesday nights when I'd won
der (as my eyes strained to make
sure that everything was spelled
correctly and I was downing my
12th Coke) why I chose to be the
in-house expert on the ins and
outs of the AP Stvle Guide and the

one who knows how to spell Hen
nessy and Etchemendy and Con
doleezza. But then I'd sit down
with my editors for dinner (usual
ly Pizza Chicago) and realize how
lucky I was to be working with
such talented and amicable peo
ple. And the next day I'd get back
to campus from my other job and
see people actually reading the
paper I had in small part helped to
produce, and then not knowing a
thing about the hottest show of the
summer didn't bother me.
An article in The New York
Times earlier this summer report
ed that fewer and fewer high
school and college students are
choosing to find summer jobs.
The reason? Many students don't
believe that a typical summer job
has any tangible benefit beyond
fast cash. So rather than work,
many students are choosing to en
roll in c lasses or programs during
the summer that will benefit them
when they apply to colleges or for
professional jobs in the future.
Before this year, 1 probably

would have been among those
students disillusioned with sum
mer employment. I may have
walked home with a wad of cash
after a Friday night of waitressing
and had time to watch television,
but the rude customers I encoun
tered and my aching feet detract
ed from any job satisfaction wait
ing tables could've provided me
with.
So when I started hunting for
employment this summer, I
made enjoying my job take prior
ity over making money. There
suit? Two very different jobs: one
as a counselor at a day camp in
Palo Alto and the other as editor
of The Weekly. My original hope
was that I'd enjoy doing both of
them but that I'd like one more
than the other and subsequently
be able to decide which I wanted
to be post-Stanford: a teacher or a
journalist.
Well, it's Wednesday, Aug. 30
— my last night putting out The
Weekly and my last night of work
this summer — and I'm still no

closer to making a career deci
sion. What 1 am closer to is nos
talgia — something I did not ex
pect to he experiencing on those
nights when we didn't finish up
with the paper until 2 a.m. and I
had to wake up at 7 a.m. to go he
energetic for my group of kids at
camp — but something I know is
a sign that I enjoyed both of my
jobs this summer.
I don't know if my jobs will
have any tangible benefits for me
in the future, but at least I can say

I enjoyed going to work every day
and, for the first time, will miss
doinir so.

Kimberly Downs will he a junior ma
joring in East Asian Studies and ini
tio ring in English this fall. She'd like
to thank Amanda, Hill, Dennis,
Duron, C-reg, Keith, Lindsey, Mallo
ry, Mark, Monya, Peigi, Peter, Tim
and Victoria for all their help in
putting out the nine issues of The
Weekly this summer. She would never
vote you off her island.
