# DAILY VIEWPOINT
## I'm dreaming of a cheap rental (with parking) 
### RITU BHATNAGAR GUEST COLUMNIST 
I've just returned to the Bay
Area after spending" the summer
in Manhattan. It was probably
two of the most amazing months
I've had — I was doing work that
I loved and was getting to spend
all my free time in New York City,
a veritable playground for
grown-ups. Every weekend I
spent there was filled with muse
um-hopping, Broadway shows,
shopping and sampling some of
the most authentic ethnic cuisine
I've ever had. I was, of course, sad
to leave it all when I stepped on
the plane heading back to San
Jose. But there was one distinct
relief that lingered in the back of
my mind: no more paying New
York City rent!
That relief didn't last too long.
I got back to the San Jose airport
and picked up a copy of The Mer

cury News, and there, in a blar
ing, 50-point headline under
neath the masthead was: "Apart
ment rents soar." Not that the
Bay Area-is-expensive concept is
a new one, but the sheer increase
of wealth in Silicon Valley just in
the time I've been at Stanford is
staggering. Apartment prices in
Santa Clara County are up over
30 percent since last year. What's
more is that tlu* rate is three times
as fast as any other housing mar
ket surveyed. There were sub
stantial price increases from June
to July — ironically, a time period
during which average Manhattan
housing rates had actually gone
down.
I suppose we can't entirely
blame the dot-commers for this
(although those of us who aren't
part of the startup wave can cer
tainly be bitter). The Bay Area —
minus the chance of earthquakes
— has always been a desirable

place to live, especially for those
on the outside looking in. And
what's unique to Silicon Valley is
that the demand is on both the
domestic and international
fronts. Housing markets like
Manhattan are losing residents
(who are being quickly replaced
by rapidly increasing numbers of
immigrants). The governor of
lowa recently announced a plan
to attract more immigrants to his
state, since so many native lowans
(especially the younger genera
tions) are leaving. But Silicon
Valley continues to be the hot
spot for the people who are al
ready here, people in other parts
of the United States and people
across the Pacific and Atlantic
Oceans. The Valley is the most
popular kid in school, and it's
going to milk it for all it's worth.
The young professionals who
have flocked to Silicon Valley
have created a culture here that's

new, exciting, always-on-edge.
It's alive, and it's the center of at
tention or at least always on the
radar screen. All of this has he
come particularly true in (he past
couple of years, with the advent
of startup fever and with 18-year
olds creating little ol' things like
Napster. But there are weighty
prices to pay for this, even more
so than those overbearing mort
gages. Within the Stanford com
munity, graduate students and
junior faculty voice their frustra
tions about finding housing in an
area so steeped in wealth. Look
beyond that community, and
there are numerous other indi
viduals operating off modest
salaries who are increasingly hav
ing to turn away from the Bay
Area. And these recent hikes in
rent will certainly not make it any
easier.
Perhaps the evolving culture
of the Bay Area is one that will be

largely industry-centric. There
aren't many methods short ol
Manhattan-style rent control that
can push this tide back to normal
cy. But there are elements slip
ping through the cracks — peo
ple ol diverse age groups, ethnic
backgrounds, professions and
mentalities — who are moving
farther from the Valley because
they just can't afford it.
It's all laissez-faire, some will
say. But that is the easy way out.
In the fast-paced, always-headed
towards-tomorrow rush ol Silicon
Valley, it is often the case that we
don't look next door to discover
who's moving out — and what
the\ might have added.
