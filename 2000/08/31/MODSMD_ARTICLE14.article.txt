## Montgomery inks extension with University 
### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Mike Montgomery, who has elevated Stanford's
men's basketball to elite status within the past three
years, signed a three-year contract extension
through the 2004-05, season, the Department of
Athletics announced last week.
"The Cardinal basketball program has been one
of the focal points of our overall athletic success at
Stanford University, and we are pleased that Coach
Montgomery will continue to direct a program that
is so highly respected nationally," said Athletic Di
rector Ted Leland.
Financial terms of the extension were not re
leased. Montgomery's current contract, which runs
through next season, reportedly pays him $500,000
a year.
Entering his 15th season on the Farm, Mont
gomery has guided the program to one Final Four
and five consecutive NCAA Tournament berths,
with a total of eight NCAA appearances during his
Stanford career.
After losing four starters from the 1999-2000 Pa
cific 10 Conference champions, Montgomery
helped last year's squad ascend to the No. 1 ranking
in both major polls for the first time in school histo
ry, in addition to tying Arizona for the conference
title with a 27-4 (15-3 Pac-10) record. For his efforts,
Montgomery was named the 2000 Naismith College
Basketball Coach of the Year and Pac-10 Coach of
the Year.
"I am pleased about the direction and the com
mitment that Ted Leland and Stanford University

have made to the basketball program," said Mont
gomery. "I'm also happy to know that I'll be here
the rest of my coaching career."
The 53-year old coach has a career record 0f442-
220 in 22 years of coaching (14 seasons at Stanford,
eight at Montana) and is the winningest men's bas
ketball coach in Stanford history with 28S wins.
Stanford is expected to be a strong team in the
2000-01 season, with three starters returning as well
as four key reserves. The team is likely to be ranked
in the top ten in most preseason polls and will con
tend for both the Pac-10 title and the national title.
