# Soccer waxes Gaels in season opener

### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
If fans of the No. 7 Stanford
women's soccer team didn't know
better, they would have sworn they
saw the exact same team that won
the Pacilic 10 Conference title last
year playing Sunday at New Mal
oney Field.
Look closer, though, and you'll
see that the squad who thumped
Saint Mary's 4-0 in the season open
er was anything but identical.
There was a new head coach,
Andy Nelson. A brand-new starting
back line, including two freslnnen in
Alisan Pabon and Natalie Spilger.
And a freshman up front, Marcie
Ward, who had what might be
called an auspicious collegiate debut
with three assists.
Not the same old Cardinal, but
hey, who's complaining? Certainly
not sophomore midfielder Callie
Withers, who scored the match's
most impressive goal with a spectac
ular header on a cross from Ward in
the 71st minute.
"At first, in the spring, it was hard
because we were so used to Steve's
ways," said Withers of Nelson, who
took over for the departed Steve
Swanson, "but now that we're in t he
preseason and we spend every day
with Coach Nelson and the assis
tants, they definitely grow on you.
We all really like him."
At first the squad seemed to lack
cohesiveness — Ward called the

first 10 minutes "nerve-wrack
ing"— but a gilt from (he Saint
Mary's defense may have taken the
edge off for the Cardinal's young
sters. In the 12th minute, Ward sent
a corner kick into the Gaels' penalty
box only to have a defender acci
dentally kick the ball into her own
net for an own goal and a 1 -0 Stan
lord lead.
"In the first 10 minutes, there
was probably a hit of nerves," said
Withers, "but by the end of the
game we really clicked. And as the
year goes on, we'll look more and
more in sync."
Minutes later, fifth-year senior
Shauna Itri took a pass from Ward
inside the box and beat Saint Mary's
goalie Ruth Montgomery with a
shot to the lower corner to give the
Cardinal a 2-0 lead, which lasted
into halftime.
Prior to the end of the half,
sophomore midfielder Becky Myers
sustained a nasty blow to the face
during a leap for a header, remain
ing down for several minutes while
trainers examined her. She did not
reenter the game, and afterward
Nelson said she may have a broken
nose, although he didn't give a
timetable for her possible return.
Jessica Poole, the sweeper for
Saint Mary's, did her best t< < stifle the
Cardinal attack at the beginning of
the second half, but she couldn't
cover the entire field herself. Stan
ford's frontline kept the pressure
up offensively, leading to several
unsuccessful breakaways, but it was
just a matter of time before the
team struck again. Stanford out
shot the Gaels 18-5 for the game
and 12-2 in the second half alone.
In the 71st minute, a give and go
on a corner kick led to Ward's cross
from the light side into the box,
where Withers headed the ball
home for the 3-0 lead. Sophomore
forward Man ia Wallis added a goal
of her own from short range in the
88th minute off another assist from
Ward and a great run by sopho
more midfielder Kelsey Carlson.
"Marcie did a great job, getting
three assists today, and she's really
out there creating things for us,"
said Nelson.
Of course, the coach wasn't
going to call everything perfect.
"1 think we need to do a better
job with possession, knowing when
to go forward, when to play short,"
he said. I thought when we played
balls into the center midfield we
gave the ball away a lot."
The team will have plenty of
time to work on that during this
week's practices before taking on
Wisconsin at New Maloney Friday
night at 7:30. The team will lie look
ing to build momentum before
showdowns with Notre Dame and
Santa Clara later in the season.
