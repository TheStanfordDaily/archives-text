# Football readies for trip to WSU
## 
### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Once upon a time, there was a
team that won the Pac-10 football
title. This team went on to the
Rose Bowl, where they gave a
Top-5 team all they could until
the end before falling in the last
few seconds, riding their prolific
offense as long as they absolutely
could.
Does this sound familiar?
Before smiling to yourself and
assuming that we're talking about
the 1999 Stanford Cardinal,
think back a little farther, to 1997
and the Washington State
Cougars. Led by eventual No. 2
overall draft pick Ryan Leaf, the
Cougars blistered the Pac-10 with
their passing attack before losing
to national champion Michigan
21-10 in Pasadena.
Washington State fans can tell
you what happened the following

year. Full of pride and confi
dence, the team went out the next
season . . . and proceeded to lose
all eight conference games to fin
ish dead last in the Pac-10.
As the Cardinal make the long
trip up to Pullman, Wash, for
their first game of the 2000 sea
son this Saturday at 7 p.m., WSU
is still trying to get back to the top
of the Pac-10, where they have
compiled an abysmal 1-15 record
during the past two seasons.
The task facing Stanford head
coach Tyrone Willingham in his
sixth season on the Farm is not
merely to get his team back to
Pasadena but to avoid falling into
the sort of tailspin which has put a
dark cloud over the WSU program.
This Saturday, the task of get
ting the Cardinal of!on the right
foot will fall largely to new start
ing quarterback Randy Fasani,
who will get his first significant
playing time at the position this

weekend. Willingham, though, is
confident in his junior signal
caller.
"Based on what we've seen
thus far, I think Randy will do
very well," said Willingham. "At
some point, 1 think he v\ ill get rid
of those first nervous moments
and really hopefully settle in and
play an outstanding football
game for us."
Fasani's ability to perform will
ultimately depend on how much
his offensive line can jell, as the
team replaces stalwarts Jeff Cron
shagen and Mike McLaughlin,
both recently graduated. Fresh
man Kirk Chambers, recently re
turned from a two-year Mormon
mission, and junior Paul
Weinacht will step in on the left
side at tackle and guard, respec
tively, where they will have the
crucial job of protecting Fasani's

At Stanford Stadium last year, the Cardinal toyed with the Washington
State defense, exploding for a 54-1 7 win to open the Pac-10 season.
blind side. Talented freshman
Kwame Harris, who has im
pressed coaches thus far, waits in
the wings at left tackle should
anything untoward happen.
With Troy Walters gone, se
nior Deßonnie Pitts becomes the
go-to receiver for Fasani; the
question isn't whether he'll do
well but whether other teams will
let him do well. Combined with
Walters last year, Pitts prevented
opposing defenses from keying
on both players at the same time.
Now, as the lone experienced re
ceiver (following the abrupt de
partures of Dave Davis and Tafiti
Uso), he can expect plenty of
double teams, meaning new
Hanker Ryan Wells, who has seri
ous speed, will have to make his
presence known.
The unit likely to get the most
work will be the secondary, the
weak point of perhaps the entire

team last year. Gone are starters
Frank Primus and Tim Smith, and
left is a great deal of uncertainty —
but Willingham is betting on expe
i ience to improve the rest.
"I am hoping that maturity will
make [the secondary] better,"
said Willingham. "I think that
when you add experience, you
have the ability to play better, an
ticipate, play more confidently
and more relaxed."
As in their Rose Bowl year, the
Cougars employ a spread offense
using four or even five receivers,
necessitating extra defensive
backs. Senior Ruben Carter, the
team's best cover man, will start at
one corner while junior Ryan Fer
nandez will man the other side.
Brian Taylor, Jason White and
Chijoke Asomugha will all see
plenty of playing time defending
WSU's multi-receiver sets.
The game begins at 7:23 p.m.
Saturday and will be broadcast
