# Football readies for trip to WSU
## 
### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Once upon a time, there was a
team that won the Pac-10 football
title. This team went on to the
Rose Bowl, where they gave a
Top-5 team all they could until
the end before falling in the last
few seconds, riding their prolific
offense as long as they absolutely
could.
Does this sound familiar?
Before smiling to yourself and
assuming that we're talking about
the 1999 Stanford Cardinal,
think back a little farther, to 1997
and the Washington State
Cougars. Led by eventual No. 2
overall draft pick Ryan Leaf, the
Cougars blistered the Pac-10 with
their passing attack before losing
to national champion Michigan
21-10 in Pasadena.
Washington State fans can tell
you what happened the following

year. Full of pride and confi
dence, the team went out the next
season . . . and proceeded to lose
all eight conference games to fin
ish dead last in the Pac-10.
As the Cardinal make the long
trip up to Pullman, Wash, for
their first game of the 2000 sea
son this Saturday at 7 p.m., WSU
is still trying to get back to the top
of the Pac-10, where they have
compiled an abysmal 1-15 record
during the past two seasons.
The task facing Stanford head
coach Tyrone Willingham in his
sixth season on the Farm is not
merely to get his team back to
Pasadena but to avoid falling into
the sort of tailspin which has put a
dark cloud over the WSU program.
This Saturday, the task of get
ting the Cardinal of!on the right
foot will fall largely to new start
ing quarterback Randy Fasani,
who will get his first significant
playing time at the position this

weekend. Willingham, though, is
confident in his junior signal
caller.
"Based on what we've seen
thus far, I think Randy will do
very well," said Willingham. "At
some point, 1 think he v\ ill get rid
of those first nervous moments
and really hopefully settle in and
play an outstanding football
game for us."
Fasani's ability to perform will
ultimately depend on how much
his offensive line can jell, as the
team replaces stalwarts Jeff Cron
shagen and Mike McLaughlin,
both recently graduated. Fresh
man Kirk Chambers, recently re
turned from a two-year Mormon
mission, and junior Paul
Weinacht will step in on the left
side at tackle and guard, respec
tively, where they will have the
crucial job of protecting Fasani's

At Stanford Stadium last year, the Cardinal toyed with the Washington
State defense, exploding for a 54-1 7 win to open the Pac-10 season.
