## IMAX adventure worth seeing 
### MONYA DE EDITORIAL STAFF 
If you need to give yourself an
IMAX li\. the Tech Museum ol In
novation in San Jose is currently fill
ing its giant IMAX theater with two
snaz/A films, "Dolphins" and "Wild
California." While both are high
quality and verv interesting, those of
us on a student budget might want
to pick the one we'd enjoy more.
That choice depends on whether
you're a thrill seeker or more of a na
ture lover.
"Dolphins" is very much geared
toward presenting a viewpoint on
dolphin conservation. The story line
focuses on a young researcher who
dedicates her life to swimming with
wild dolphins in foreign seas in
order to learn about how they talk to
each other. Some great shots make

the viewer feel that he 01 she is swim
ming right alongside. The best
"IMAX moment" comes when a
jumping dolphin appears to he
landing right on your head.
Hut "Dolphins," lor all its pretty
island and underwater shots, feels
more like a nature documentary on
.in unusually big screen. Its purpose
is to educate more than to make use
of the capabilities of IMAX. Signifi
cant screen time is devoted to
footage of the humans in their nat
ural habitat. It does succeed in rais
ing awareness of dolphin conserva
tion issues, though.
The music in the film is composed
and sung by Sting, and it's basically
annoying. On a happier tie-in note,
kids can frolic with the exhibits relat
ed to dolphins on display in the lech.
"Wild California" works on a
completely different level. It isexhil

arating ancl fully makes use of the
medium. Have you ever wanted to
snowboard at top speed? Climb up
to and inside a sequoia? Sky-surf?
Surf Mavericks? Now you can.
Strapping cameras in all the right
places, the producers simulate
heart-quickening experiences that
can be found all over this state.
A trip to Disneyland puts you on
a roller coaster. A trip to Hollywood
makes you a star with popping flash
bulbs in front of your eyes for a brief
moment.
This film deals with conservation
issues too but doesn't sacrifice mo
mentum. One of the most amazing
mini-stories is that of a man who res
cues bald eagle eggs and returns the
chicks to their clifftop nests. The
sight of one man dangling from a
helicopter and placing his cargo
back in the nest as the ocean gleams

is truly memorable. The otters pro
filed at Monterey Bay Aquarium are
extremely cute.
"Wild California" pauses occa
sionally to pay homage to the men

who niade strides in entertainment,
computers and other pursuits. But
the history doesn't dilute the excite
ment. If you've got limited time and
money, pop in to see this film.
