# Marin's Shakespeare uneven, tactless
## 
### VLADA TEPER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
True the Stratford open theater feel is there. Males
playing females. Beer-guzzling audience. The loud
snorting laughter of your neighbor. The feeling is also
there, however, that the great 1564 playwright himself
would not approve. And might not even laugh.
"The (Complete Works of Wllm. Shkspr. (abridged),"
the second of three Marin Shakespeare Company's
2000 productions, insists on combining all 37 Shake
spearean plays in two hours-plus. When all is said and
done, neither the wit nor the potential humorous phys
icality of Shakespearean works has been 112 ully exploited.
As the Robert S. Currier production opens, Patrick
Flick, one of three actors presenting himself as an Ox
ford, ()hio Professor asks the audience whether anyone
has read Shakespeare's "King John." An audience
member, later revealed to be the third actor, replies, "It's
about that hunchback."
Darren Bridgett, who continues to provide the im
mature voice and who gets everything wrong through
out the production, sets the premise of the show. Con
fusing "King John" with "Richard the III," he helps set
the boundary between the great playwright's most fa
mous plays and those termed "bad."
You must be here for one of two reasons: you have ei
ther slept through Shakespearean discussions in sch(x)l
and are giving it another go or you still love brilliant Bill
and want to see how they interpret his works . Based on
this assumption, Shakespearean histories and tragedies
including his masterpieces "King Lear," "Henry VIII"
and "Richard the III" become football game maneuvers,
and his 16 comedies become one short story where twin
sets ofbimlxjs and squires have orgies and later fall in love.
After a biographical introduction where Shakespeare
is tastelessly and for no apparent reason confused with
Hitler, what follows is a drawn out retelling of "Romeo
and Juliet" Castro St.-style — maximum amount of gay
jokes and minimal plot development. Juliet's nanny and
a Polish-accented Godfather-gesturing priest who gives
Juliet poison are the center of attention while Romeo
flirts with an audience member and Juliet says, "Who
needs Romeo?"
Despite the vomiting jokes and the sexual puns, the
most verbally subtle of which mirror the great play

wright's, the scenarios get more creative. "Titus An
dronicus" is ingeniously suinniarized cooking-show
style, and "Othello" is a rap performed by all three actors
(Lucas McClure, Darren Bridgett and Patrick Flick) with
witty lyrics.
The road to improvement is rapidly clogged when a
real venturing into Shakespeare's comedies or tragedies
is bypassed. Macbeth is evoked as a quintessential Mc-
Scottish piece with a memorable glowing sword tight.
"Antony and Cleopatra" turns into a discussion of
geopolitical works.
The product ion does finally partly redeem itself with
the taking on of "Hamlet." Bridgett sets up the work
nicely as he refuses to do "it." The"it" is the murder of
Claudius in which Bridgett is refusing to take part, fear
ing he won't do it justice. With a hilarious audience par
ticipation bit reenacting Ophelia's psyche, the play peeks
at the art of performance.
What the production could have been is most clearly
revealed by the conclusion. "Hamlet" is sped up, re
played faster and faster and both the physical comedy
and the verbal summary are amusing and tongue-in
cheek.
With a script by Adam Long, Daniel Singer and Jess
Winfield, the production is not a children's event. Sev
eral references made to the "Complete Works" as a fam
ily play are false and invalid. With too many overt sexu
al digs, alcohol inspired quips, politically aimed satires
and constant ventures into silliness and current events;
the children will laugh at inappropriate gestures and
yawn through the rest.
Still, the sound effects are cute and the acting well re
hearsed as to be perfectly synchronized with the sound
track. The set lighting works as it alternates between
night and day scenes and spotlights. The conveniently
utilized set from both "Cyrano de Bergerac" and " The
Merchant of Venice" works as it evokes the Veronese
marble look which is the setting of the opening of "(com
plete Works." It is simple but sufficiently suggestive and
allows for diverse entry and escape possibilities.
You never do learn what "King John" is about as you
leave the theater. Still, I heard comments of, "Well,
'Antony and Cleopatra' could definitely use some edit
ing. Antony does not die for like 10 pages." The critical
take two is inspired at the historically acknowledged ge
nius — the production has not been for naught.
