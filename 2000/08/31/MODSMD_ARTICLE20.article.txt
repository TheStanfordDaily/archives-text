# Elastica impresses with CD

### MICHAEL BAER STAFF WRITER 
It was with a tad of skepticism
that I picked up Elastica's The
Menace. After all, the band's only
other album came out five years
ago, and in the meantime only a
few songs had leaked from the

band. It seemed most of their time
was spent on band squabbles and
extracurricular activities (most sig
nificantly lead singer Justine
Frischmann's long-term affair and
subsequent break-up with Blur
head Damon Albarn).
Like Blur's last album, 13, The
Menace is a more experimental,

noisy and atmospheric album than
the band's previous output — and
also contains many oblique allu
sions to romantic frustration. In
fact, the album ends with a cover of
Trio's "Da Da Da I Don't Love You
You Don't Love Me" (or, as us
Americans know it, "That Volk
swagen Commercial Song").
Where not hung up on the ro
mantic, the album is highly ener
getic, the songs as catchy as ever, if
a bit more complex and varied. In
fact, the first few songs run
through with enough energy to be
appropriated as cheerleading rou
tines (and "How He Wrote Klasti
ca Man" seems to have been ap
propriated from one). The wise
arse "Your Arse My Place" sees the
band playfully shouting out such
lines as "Cocaine is crack / Blondie
was black!" which likely sound bet
ter on album than they translate to
print.

The members of Elastica haven't just been sitting around.
The slow songs are mesmeriz
ing, the sardonic "Love Like C )urs"
repeating the refrain, "A love like
ours will never die" over increas
ingly loud instrumentation.
Frischmann expressed frustra
tion at Blur's L> for dragging out
the erstwhile couple's dirty laun
dry. But The Menace shows it was
hard for her to avoid doing the
same, even if in interviews she
claims the beautiful, hypnotic spo

ken-word "My Sex" "isn't directed
at a certain somebody
It still muses, "What 1 want is a
room with a three-bar lire, like the
one you had before, when you
were poor, and 1 just liked you
more."
And, in"The Way I Like It," it's
hard to hear "Had a lover who was
made of sand / And the wind blew
him away" and not suppose who
that might be.
Some might complain that less
than half of the 13 songs are new
— there's the cover, "Human,"
from a 1998 soundtrack and five
songs from last year's LP. Some
might complain about the

album's scant running time —
less than 40 minutes. Some might
complain that the band really
hasn't gone that far iti five years
— still doing alternative-influ
enced pop songs with stolen
hooks (.ind "Nothing Stays the
Same" does sound startlingly like
Velvet Underground). Still oth
ers might complain about the
sonic duality of the album.
But the fact is that this is a good
album — great even — by a damn
good band. Let's just hope that
next time they get over their writ
ers' block, internal conflicts and ex
ternal distractions much more
quickly.
