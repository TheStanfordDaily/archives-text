# Elastica impresses with CD
## 
### MICHAEL BAER STAFF WRITER 
It was with a tad of skepticism
that I picked up Elastica's The
Menace. After all, the band's only
other album came out five years
ago, and in the meantime only a
few songs had leaked from the

band. It seemed most of their time
was spent on band squabbles and
extracurricular activities (most sig
nificantly lead singer Justine
Frischmann's long-term affair and
subsequent break-up with Blur
head Damon Albarn).
Like Blur's last album, 13, The
Menace is a more experimental,

noisy and atmospheric album than
the band's previous output â€” and
also contains many oblique allu
sions to romantic frustration. In
fact, the album ends with a cover of
Trio's "Da Da Da I Don't Love You
You Don't Love Me" (or, as us
Americans know it, "That Volk
swagen Commercial Song").
Where not hung up on the ro
mantic, the album is highly ener
getic, the songs as catchy as ever, if
a bit more complex and varied. In
fact, the first few songs run
through with enough energy to be
appropriated as cheerleading rou
tines (and "How He Wrote Klasti
ca Man" seems to have been ap
propriated from one). The wise
arse "Your Arse My Place" sees the
band playfully shouting out such
lines as "Cocaine is crack / Blondie
was black!" which likely sound bet
ter on album than they translate to
print.
