# RPM's is a copycat album

### WILL TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
RPM 2000 is another new R&B
group, brought to you in the hopes
that you have never heard of the
same music clone by better groups
in the 1960's such as t he O'Jays or
Temptations or clone far better in
the 1990's by Boy/. II Men. To put
it simply, if you took the underly
ing beat to this music and added
the entire album from any other
group that appeared in the 1990'5,
such as H-Town, Public An
nouncement, Shai or any other
one-hit R&B wonder with similar
ly interchangeable names, you
would have this album, Peace in
the City.

Peace in the City

Some of you readers have asked
me why I berate R&B music today.
The answer is inherent in RPM
2000. The album from front to end
provides more of the same tired
latitudes, often designed in much
the same way that countless other
albums have done. If they were
women, the name of the group
would be Brownstone / 702 / take a
number. The lack of diversity on
the album — the simple inability to
experiment at all — is a liability
that should soon be prosecutable.
The album opens with
"R.P.iM.," a rather forgettable
track, which only deserves some

mention for the interesting fact
that there is a Wu-Tang sample
from ( .R EAM — a group that
definitely could never be accused
of being unwilling to experiment
with its styling. I am left to wonder
how they got permission to use the
track, as it is simply desecrated by
this pulp.
The group can sing. The three
members definitely have vocal tal
ents, and they occasionally are
showcased in a way that doesn't
make me want to cry. The fifth and
sixth tracks, "She Never Calls" and
"Next," are surprisingly nice. 1 say
surprisingly because I was sur
prised to find a relatively well writ
ten ballad on this album not writ
ten by Babyface (who contributes a
relatively mediocre song called
"Got to Get Over You") and a fast
paced song that doesn't entirely
fall into the posturing trap that be
falls so much of the genre these
days. Both are not without fault.
"Next" doesn't avoid all of the
bling-bling of this era, but it does
give the young men a chance to
snipe at people who might want to
hop on their bandwagon when
(and if) they are successful.
"Down Low" brings to mind the
problem with the album as a whole.

do acknowledge that the man is
good at what he does when he wants
to be.
This song isn't a remake of the 12
Play track of the same name, and it is
definitely not going to reach the
nearly omni present status that it
achieved.
RPM wants to catch lightning in a

bottle and instead ends up getting
struck by it. The lyrics are almost
more laughable than seductive, but
"Down Low" is a classic compared to
"U Don't Really Know." That's a
song that should make the author
want to hang up his song writing
pen.
There was a time when it was
possible to perfectly interweave
sex and music. It was possible to
make a song sultry, seductive and
way more lewd than you might
realize until it was too late. This
was Prince's modus operandi. He

perfected it, in fact.
Now, it seems that people
have to virtually describe every
single act that is physically possi
ble before they can consider
themselves adequately sexy.
There is just so much that a mar
ket can bear of something awful be
fore it gives up its dead. I fervently
believe R&B music is rapidly head
ing toward that point where it will
no longer be able to support itself.
Frankly, I will be rather glad when
that day arrives. When a genre is
simply recycling itself, it rots.
