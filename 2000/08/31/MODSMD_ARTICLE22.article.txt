# Anger, Marshall mix 'n' match
## 
### STEVEN RAPHAEL STAFF WRITER 
They say that oil and water
don't mix, and two new albums
featuring Darol Anger and Mike
Marshall combine to show that
this scientific truth holds for
music as well.
One of the albums, entitled
Head West, features several mu
sicians, all of whom are good on
their own, combining their tal
ents under the moniker Como
tion to create a mediocre product.
1 n the analogy, both water and oil
are essentially good by them-

selves, but they just don't mix.
Let's call Anger, Marshall and
Anger-Marshall Band drummer
Aaron Johnston the water. Anger
and Marshall have collaborated
on dozens of projects over the last
20 years, from the David Grisman
Quintet to the Anger-Marshall
band.
Fhe new album by the Anger-
Marshall Band, Brand New (lan,
shows that the three musicians
are still as good as ever. Brand
New Can may not have the same
raw feeling that the fust Anger-
Marshall Band album had, but it
is a fine album nevertheless.
As is customary for these musi

cians, the group shows extensive
range and great skill on their re
spective instruments. Songs like
"Around Here," are tight and
funky while others like "Brookes
boro Terrace" are beautiful and
melodic.
One song, "Zakir," is a strange
ly exotic journey into empty
space, squeaks and eerie musings.
Another, "Coal Burnin' Grease
Fire," is a feel-good up-beat blue
grass number.
The album is not the best by
Anger and Marshall. From time
to time, one gets the feeling that
the musicians are repeating
themselves or falling into cliches.
But, overall, Brand New Can is a
great album that keeps a listeners'
attention.
Fhe second album released
within the month that features
Anger, Marshall, and Johnston is
Comotion. It also features
Michael Rang, best known for his
mandolin and violin work that
defines the String Cheese Inci
dent, Paul McCandless, who has
played with numerous groups

Braiid New Can

Compass Records

over the years, including Oregon ,
and Bela Fleck and the Fleck
tones, and Tye North and Jeff
Sipe from Leftover Salmon.
These musicians are the oil to

Anger, Marshall and Johnston's
water.
Each <>l the musicians (with
the possible exception of tin
two from Leftover Salmon) have
demonstrated that they are ca
pable of produc ing high qualiu
music. Consequently, one
would expect Comotion to be a
killer album, adding different
styles together into one amazing
product.
Yet, for some reason, the
killing never quite happens. Co
motion isn't bad by any means;
with musicians like these, one
could hardly expect it to be bad.
It's just not good.
As opposed to "Brand New
Can," which grabs a listener and
announces it's presence, "Head
West" merely drones on without
notice. It has neither excitement
nor beauty to redeem itself.
It's difficult to pinpoint the
specific problem with the album.
At times, McCandless's soprano
sax combines with Anger's violin
to produce a new-age, mellow,
boring sound.
Other times, Rang enters with
a distorted mandolin tone that
sticks out like a sore thumb
against the acoustic background
of the other members.
Perhaps it is simply that this
album makes no new claims,
brings no new ideas into the al
ready existing body of work b\
these musicians. What is clear is
that the water is good and the oil
is good, but mixing the two just
didn't work.
