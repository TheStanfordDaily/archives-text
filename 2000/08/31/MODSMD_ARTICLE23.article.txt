# Improv fest is full of fun
## 
### STACY WAGNER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When going to the theater,
most of us think we know what
we're getting ourselves into. lVi
haps we're expecting a bawdy
farce or a dryly written drama, but
invariably there occur unforeseen
scenes.
The surprises are often what
make the show memorable, and
that's why Bay Area Theatre -
ports has professionally estab
lished improv troupes (and work
shops for interested amateurs).
The games invented by Theatre -
ports' members and founders are
played in every continent, except
Australia.
This year's San Francisco The
atre Sports festival began with Star
Trekkin' night. That's right, im
prov comedy embedded in the
language and nuance of Star Trek.
Though I can't exactly say I regret
not being able to attend that per
formance, you Trekkies out there
should definitely find out when
this sketch will be coming back.
I put in an appearance for Im
prov Shakespeare. Perhaps you
don't consider yourself part of the
crowd that enjoys a night of the-

ater filled with ayes and thous, but
Shakespeare fan or not, this
show, different each time, guaran
tees laughs and fun.
The combination BATS and
LATS group wove together a per
formance that included Shake
spearean elements such as mistak
en identity and murderous buf
foons but delivered them along
side speeches full of sexual innu
endo and contemporary jokes.
The audience members were
given the opportunity at the be
ginning of the show to suggest the
title on which the performance
would be improvised. After sever
al shouts from audience members
(some of whom seemed to consid
er themselves amateur comedi
ans), the players selected the title
"The Dark Forest." Not nearly as
menacing as it sounds, the story
presented proved to be a veritable
Shakespearean comedy. It only
differed in that it was actually
laugh-out-loud funny. If you
thought Shakespearean humor
solely served up puns based on
words we no longer use, think
again.
Incorporating the technique of
asides, in which characters divulge
their true feelings while the other
actors on stage are momentarily
deaf to the confessions, one actress
melodramatically revealed her de
sire to escape the confines < >11 ler < as
tle in the dark forest. As her speech
ended, she turned to the actress
playing her mother, secure as an\-
one who's delivered an aside. Jok
ing on the Shakespearean conven
tion, the "mother" indignantly re
sponded, "I'm right here!
Often, the funniest moments
were those in which Shake
speare's techniques were toved
with or his style incorrerth at
tempted. Did one actress intend
to call her daughters "the fruits
of my loom?" Who knows, but
everyone in the audience
cracked up.
The players of "The Dark For
est" might have actualh conic
closest to accurately representing
Shakespeare by unintentionally
depicting a story that at times was
extremely confusing. A limited
number of actors doing multiple
parts made for a few bumpv sp< >ts
along the wax. Almost mirac u
louslv, however, this fulh impro
vised, pseudo-Shakes pea rear
plot left no loose ends.
