# Mann, Penn perform off-kilter acoustic set
## 
### MICHAEL BAER STAFF WRITER 
In the picturesque hills olSaratoga lies an out
of-the-way artist center called Villa Montalvo. He
hind the center lies a small amphitheater, and,
last Wednesday, it was the stage for "Acoustic
Vaudeville" with Aiinee Mann and Michael Penn,
a surprisingly rousing night by these relatively
laid-back artists.
Both singers — now mail ied to each other —
achieved success in the '80s on the strength of a
song. For Mann, this was "Voices Carry," by her
band Til Tuesday. For Penn, it was his solo hit
"No Myth." Unfortunately, in the decade which
followed their respective hits, their careers failed
to take off; commercial stagnation and lights with
record labels meant their sporadic output in that
time was only consumed by critics and their cult
audiences.
However, a little film called "Magnolia,"
scored by Ms. Mann, has meant that at least her
career has looked up in recent months, the
soundtrack having earned her an ()scar nomina
tion and critical accolades. This year's self-re
leased Bachelor No. 2, or the Last Remains of the
Dodo, has also done relatively well.
Penn's latest album — MP4: Days Since Lost
Time Incident— has not done quite as well but

was nevertheless well-reviewed and well-received
(by those who actually heard it).
The night started out with an unusual opening
act, a stand-up comedian (whose name no one at
the show seemed to recall). I le was intermittently
entertaining — as comedians tend to be — and I
thought I had pretty much seen the last of him
when the music show began. More 011 that later.
Mann came up on stage first, then, after a
song, stood in the background as Penn delivered
his opener. Although they eventually played to
gether— swapping lead and background vocals
as well as standard and bass guitars — the mater
ial in the first half of the show was not exactly suit
ed for a sizzling night. Mann's somnolent voice
and Penn's reflective tone don't exactly spell "ex
citement." and, just when it looked as though the)
might talk to the audience, they hauled out the
comedian to do the talking for them!
The mix ol introspective songs and left-of-cen
ter comedy didn't gel at first, though an audience
plucked straight out of dot-com-ville and old Val
ley money may have had something to do with
the lack of energy.
But after a while, Mann, Penn and the band
(consisting of a keyboardist, a violinist, a percus
sionist and a guitarist) loosened up, making for a
112 un night. A particularly funny moment was hear
ing Penn's "thoughts" while introducing a song,

as voiced by the comedian in the same fashion
overused in television and film.
Mann did all her solo hits (no "Voices (larry"),
some "Magnolia" / 'Dodo' material and even a
duet with Penn on the encore closer, "No Myth."
This and Penn's long yel quickly-paced "Brave
New World" — along with asmart-aleck guitarist
— got things cooking. Granted, it was near the
end that energy really began to pervade the pro
ceedings, but it was good nonetheless. Both the
singers and this reviewer were aghast to see peo
ple leaving as the encore began, Mann chiding,
"You're leaving now?" and Penn chiming in,
"Now's when we're actually going to play the
good songs!"
it was true, too. Mann's "The Other End of the
Telescope" (which she cowrote with Elvis Costel
lo, whom Penn proceeded to mock) was her at
her loosest and most energetic:. And, of course,
"No Myth" was a high point to end the night.
For your next conceit at Montalvo, the>ugh, I d
have one strong piece of advice: get there early.
Seeing as the motorized methods of working up
the hill involve taking a car up a narrow road (to a
manned check-in) and taking a shuttle from the
local community college, this is crucial to not miss
ing anything. Also, if you get there early, there are
miles ofbeautilul trails to walk betbre the concert.
Of how many concert locales can you sav that ?
