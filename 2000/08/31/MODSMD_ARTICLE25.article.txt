Ahh, the wonders of pop.
()nly with popular music can you
get a 20-foot skull laughing through
a smoking jaw that it's time to start
smoking some pot because, damn,
things are going to get crazy.
Only with performers like Dr.

Up in Smoke Tour
Featuring Eminem,
Warren G, Snoop
Dogg, Xzibit

Di e could concert-goers delight in
an explosive-laced, brightly lit and
enormously overdone set to the e\-

treme that it was during the Up In
Smoke tour's second stop in San
Jose on Aug. 13.
Only Snoop Dogg (some still
fondly remember the days of Snoop
Doggy Dogg) could come out on
stage in a Gold '64, hitting switches
like mad. Only Snoop Dogg could
make it look so fun.
Not to sav there weren't bad
tilings about the huge show. There
is always a dark, commercial under
side to popular music, and that was
embodied in Eminem's set.
Eminem, always the understated
and subtle performer, started his set
standing on a six-foot high marquee
of his own name. Alter fireworks ex
ploded on each end of his name, he
launched into hit after hit.
The onh song that roused me at

all was " I Am," with lyrics like " I can't
even take a shit / without someone
standing next to it. Unfortunately,
the crowd seemed unlazed by the
mostly juvenile antics of Dr. Di e's
newest protege. The\ rocked along
with the mad millionaire, sending
his words right back at him.
Xzibit was a highlight of the show,
but he only rapped for two songs.
1 lis energy was perhaps the highest
of the performers, and th.it may
have a lot to do with the fact that he
more recentl\ surged to stardom.
Snoop was the consummate su
perstar. lie came with 1 lis smooth
vet sublimeh arrogant flow and stole
the show as always. I lis set with Di e
was a good mix of new hits, like "Still
Dippin " with the ok I and classic, like
"Gin and Juice." While he hasn't

dropped off terribly, the crowd re
acted with roars to each of the ( las
sies as the) came through the gigan
tic speakers, and Snoop stayed c los
er to his old material.
The climax of the show came with
"Gin <ind Juice." Snoop and Die
drove out onto stage in a low-rider
with Ore jumping out to si.irt the
song while Snoop remained in the
car, hitting switches in glee.
In an era in which rappers will
struggle through new material to
promote it.it was nice to sec- a per
former take advantage of his supei -
stardom and settle into a set ol truh
c lassic rap. It was also nice to see that
he was still having fun, Mill hitting
the switches in his '(>4 with .ill the
ladies sax ing, "Don I slop, and never
stop, and lei me ride!"
