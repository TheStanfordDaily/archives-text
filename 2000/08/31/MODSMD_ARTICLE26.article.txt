# Crime comedy 'Crew' is disappointing
## 
### Hilary Bienstock CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"The Crew" may be a terrible
movie, but it is also performing a
great service for society. For once
and for all, "The Crew" loudl) de
clares: "()ld people are not funny!"
What "Big Momma's House" did
for lat people, this movie does for
old people. Never again will mis
guided producers be able to make
movies like "Grumpy Old Men"
and 'The Odd Couple, Part 11
while repeating the refrain, "But
we didn't know that old people
weren't funny!"
The story of "The Crew" is the
usual 1 lollywood fare, except th.it it
has geriatric protagonists. Its basic
story should sound familiar to am
moviegoer: someone on the wrong

side of the law is, for once, trying to
go about some honest business,
when he or she somehow gets tan
gled up with some other bad guys
who mean harm. By using bad-guy
skills finely honed In a life of crime,
the main character gets extricated
from the dangerous situation, and
everything ends happily. For years
its been a mostly-successful formu
la.
Until now, that is. This latest of
the genre dutifully puts the recipe
to work but ends up with mind
numbing boredom rather than the
usual light comedy.
in this movie, our heroes, lout
retired wiseguys (that's gangsters to
you), are about to be thrown out of
their retirement hotel in Florida be
cause of its real estate value. In
order to make the crumbling build

ing seem less attractive, they stage a
murcler in its lobby by blowing the
head oil a both from the local
morgue. Unfortunately, the now
headless body belongs to the father
of a South American drug lord,
who conducts a search lor the per
petrators. Meanwhile, the gang
sters are blackmailed into kidnap
ping an aging Jewish mother type.
Just like the plot, the actors are
poorly-recycled veterans who, this
film would have you believe, wait
ing for that big casting call in the
sky. Although Dan Hedaya and
Seymour Cassel have appeared in
respected movies in the past, the\
certainly aren't given a chance to
shine in this film. As the dumb one
and the silent one, they have only a
few lines apiece and spend most of
their time looking old ;md waiting

lor another c harac ter to s.i\ some
thing.
Richard Drey fuss, the narrator
and the leader of the group, is the
onlv character who isn't immedi
ately typecast with a nickname; it
seems that he mistakes his charac
ter's lac k of stereotype for a hick of
personality. And as for Hurt
Reynolds, playing the hot-tem
pered wiseguy, he's convincing
enough; the audience wonders il
some of his anger stems from being
forced to act in this awful movie in
the first place.
The female characters tr\
valianth to rescue this film from
monotonv. but their parts just
aren't big enough. Carrie-Ann
Moss, the hardworking female de
tective, looks drab in her little
sweater sets; we wish she'd put on
her all-leather outfit from"The Ma
trix" before going out to fight

crime.
As the hooker with the heart ol
gold, (ennilei Filh is well-cast >Ik'
(lispla\ s lots of cleavage and almost
as much spunk. And Lainie Ka/an
is just about perfect as the deli-own
ing Jewish matriarch, kulling
about even thing and nothing.
But whatever life these women
manage to inject is choked out of it
asdirectoi Michael Dinner drags us
through s< cue after scene of lifeless
old-people humor, stale as the
month-old liverwurst peddled in
Kazan's kosher deli.
You might think that a ( ist ol
this magnitude might be able to
pull oil a few good one-linerv but
the jokes that are actually liinm (.ill
two of them) are in the preview. s< >
once you've seen that, you have ab
solutely no reason to watch this
movie. All told. "T he (.rew is a film
best avoided.
