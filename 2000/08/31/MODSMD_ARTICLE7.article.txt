## Hennessy set to become president 
### DENNIS TYLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
What would a university be with
out continual change? With a con
tinuous shift from old administra
tion to new, a university does not
lend itself to constancy, but rather
strives to evolve with the changing
times. It attempts to create a method
where progression meets perfec
tion. Stanford, no doubt, has mas
tered this method brilliantly.
With administrative changes be
coming routine this summer, a new
group of dedicated staff will come to
the University assuming new roles
and responsibilities — all of them
eager to continue the success set
forth by their predecessors but none
of them fully aware of the incredible
task that lies ahead. The most impor
tant administrative change, by far,
will be the induction of Stanford's
10th president, John Hennessy.
Beginning on Sept I, University
President Gerhard Casper will step
down and Hennessy, who is cur
rently provost, will officially be
named as the new president of Stan
ford. Having served as president for
eight years, Casper will be replaced
by someone who has been affiliated
with the University even longer.
Hennessy, after serving the Univer

sity tor 23 years, lias proven himself
more than ready to take on the high
est position in administration and
appears to be prepared for the job.
"1 hope that we are a stronger
and better institution in the years to
come. I hope to continue the dra
matic enhancements that we have
made to undergraduate education
over the past five-plus years," said
Hennessy.
"The completion of the ('.lark
(tenter and the initiation of the Bio-
X program will significantly change
the way we pursue interdisciplinary
research and teaching opportunities
in bioscience and bioengineering,"
he added.
Hennessy's primary goal as pres
ident will be to enhance undergrad
uate and graduate education at
Stanford .is much as possible. He will
place heavy emphasis on the impor
tance of research and teaching.
"I will try to make it easier to en
courage .md support interdiscipli
nary activities both in the research
and teaching arena," said Hennessy.
"We have made and are continuing
to make a major investment in un
dergraduate education. We have also
initiated a number of new efforts to
provide many more research, honors
and independent study opportuni
ties for undergraduates."

Bui Hennessy does recognize
that improving education is merely
one aspect of being president. He
admits that his most difficult task will
be conveying to many different peo
ple how the University operates and
functions.
"Communicating with the many
diverse audiences that need to un
derstand the challenges facing Stan
ford, from students, to faculty, to
staff , to community leaders, to alum
ni, to national leaders will be ex
tremeh hard," said Hennessy.
Although the job will be verv de
manding, Stanford administrators
are more than confident th.it Hen
nessy will do a remarkable job as
president.
"All of us in student affairs are
very excited about Stanford's future
with John Hennessy as president,"
said Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Marc Wais. "John has received rave
reviews from students, staff and fac
ulty for his accomplishments as a
teacher, scientist and entrepreneur.
He is both respected and well liked
by students and is viewed as person
able, energetic and passionate about
Stanford and its students.
"His concern for the welfare of
students in and out of the classroom
is demonstrated in the scope of his
activities — 112 rom serving as an acacl

emit: advisor to both undergraduate
and graduate students to serving
'Midnight Breakfast' in a chefs
while hat and apron to students
preparing for finals each year,"
added Wais.
"I believe we have tound a leader
to be sure, but we also have found
the right person for the right time in
Stanford's historv. John's intelli
gence, experience and strength of
character are a perfect match lot the
challenges Stanford will face in the
coming years," said chair of the
Board of Trustees Robert Bass to

ilit' Stanford Report.
"His deep understanding of the
university's traditions combined
with his passion for innovation make
him a choice that not onlv reflects in
the best possible way on Stanford
but brings honor to all of us who are
fortunate enough to be associated
with the university," added Bass.
With an incredible career com
mitment to Stanford, such praise
and adoration is not unexpected for
Hennessv: in 1977, he began as an
