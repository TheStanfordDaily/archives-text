## Hennessy set to become president 
### DENNIS TYLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
What would a university be with
out continual change? With a con
tinuous shift from old administra
tion to new, a university does not
lend itself to constancy, but rather
strives to evolve with the changing
times. It attempts to create a method
where progression meets perfec
tion. Stanford, no doubt, has mas
tered this method brilliantly.
With administrative changes be
coming routine this summer, a new
group of dedicated staff will come to
the University assuming new roles
and responsibilities — all of them
eager to continue the success set
forth by their predecessors but none
of them fully aware of the incredible
task that lies ahead. The most impor
tant administrative change, by far,
will be the induction of Stanford's
10th president, John Hennessy.
Beginning on Sept I, University
President Gerhard Casper will step
down and Hennessy, who is cur
rently provost, will officially be
named as the new president of Stan
ford. Having served as president for
eight years, Casper will be replaced
by someone who has been affiliated
with the University even longer.
Hennessy, after serving the Univer

sity tor 23 years, lias proven himself
more than ready to take on the high
est position in administration and
appears to be prepared for the job.
"1 hope that we are a stronger
and better institution in the years to
come. I hope to continue the dra
matic enhancements that we have
made to undergraduate education
over the past five-plus years," said
Hennessy.
"The completion of the ('.lark
(tenter and the initiation of the Bio-
X program will significantly change
the way we pursue interdisciplinary
research and teaching opportunities
in bioscience and bioengineering,"
he added.
Hennessy's primary goal as pres
ident will be to enhance undergrad
uate and graduate education at
Stanford .is much as possible. He will
place heavy emphasis on the impor
tance of research and teaching.
"I will try to make it easier to en
courage .md support interdiscipli
nary activities both in the research
and teaching arena," said Hennessy.
"We have made and are continuing
to make a major investment in un
dergraduate education. We have also
initiated a number of new efforts to
provide many more research, honors
and independent study opportuni
ties for undergraduates."

Bui Hennessy does recognize
that improving education is merely
one aspect of being president. He
admits that his most difficult task will
be conveying to many different peo
ple how the University operates and
functions.
"Communicating with the many
diverse audiences that need to un
derstand the challenges facing Stan
ford, from students, to faculty, to
staff , to community leaders, to alum
ni, to national leaders will be ex
tremeh hard," said Hennessy.
Although the job will be verv de
manding, Stanford administrators
are more than confident th.it Hen
nessy will do a remarkable job as
president.
"All of us in student affairs are
very excited about Stanford's future
with John Hennessy as president,"
said Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Marc Wais. "John has received rave
reviews from students, staff and fac
ulty for his accomplishments as a
teacher, scientist and entrepreneur.
He is both respected and well liked
by students and is viewed as person
able, energetic and passionate about
Stanford and its students.
"His concern for the welfare of
students in and out of the classroom
is demonstrated in the scope of his
activities — 112 rom serving as an acacl

emit: advisor to both undergraduate
and graduate students to serving
'Midnight Breakfast' in a chefs
while hat and apron to students
preparing for finals each year,"
added Wais.
"I believe we have tound a leader
to be sure, but we also have found
the right person for the right time in
Stanford's historv. John's intelli
gence, experience and strength of
character are a perfect match lot the
challenges Stanford will face in the
coming years," said chair of the
Board of Trustees Robert Bass to

ilit' Stanford Report.
"His deep understanding of the
university's traditions combined
with his passion for innovation make
him a choice that not onlv reflects in
the best possible way on Stanford
but brings honor to all of us who are
fortunate enough to be associated
with the university," added Bass.
With an incredible career com
mitment to Stanford, such praise
and adoration is not unexpected for

assistant professor of electrical engi
neering. Then he became an associ
ate professor of electrical engineer
ing in 1983. In 1984, he became the
founder and chief scientist of MIPS
computer systems. Eventually, he
became the chief architect of Silicon
Graphics Computer Systems in
1992 hut not before becoming a
professor of electrical engineering
and computer science in 1980. In
1994, he became chair of the Com
puter Science Department.
Hennessy, in 1990, was named
dean of the School of Engineering.
In 1999, he took over as Stanford's
provost. And, now, Hennessy will
become the 10th president of the
University.
Indeed, his rise to presidency was
no accident. In fact, his career serves
as proof to how a commitment to this
institution can lead to great success.
Philosophy professor and soon
to-be Provost John Etchemendy
displayed his obvious admiration
for Hennessy when he described
him as "a great teacher and a bril
liant researcher, with a touch of en
trepreneur thrown into the mix. He
is the embodiment of everything
that has made Stanford one of the
world's greatest universities."
In all of these years, Hennessy

has accumulated many great mem
ories and experiences while at the
University. According to him, his
two most memorable experiences
have occurred in the classroom.
"Renovating and teaching the
undergraduate introductory
course in computer architecture
and organization, which 1 did in the
early 19905, and working with my
first group of superb graduate stu
dents on the project that became
MIPS have been very special to
me," said Hennessy.
Hennessy, 47, is marking the
path for the new millennium. When
asked if he was intimidated by such
a powerful position, Hennessy jok
ingly replied, "I'd be a fool if I didn't
have some trepidation."
Although he is uncertain how
long he will remain as president, he
will try to maintain the Stanford
legacy for years to come.
"I can't say how long I will be
president. The job has certainly be
come more demanding over time
and presidents have had shorter
terms in recent times, but it's very
hard to say until you've done the
job for a while .... My main goal
will be to make Stanford the best it
can be. This is a task that will re
quire the engagement of the entire
Stanford community: faculty, stu
dents, stafT, alumni and friends. 1
look forward to working with this
community in pursuit of these op
portunities."

neering. Then he became an associ
ate professor of electrical engineer
ing in 1983. In 1984, he became the
founder and chief scientist of MIPS
computer systems. Eventually, he
became the chief architect of Silicon
Graphics Computer Systems in
1992 hut not before becoming a
professor of electrical engineering
and computer science in 1980. In
1994, he became chair of the Com
puter Science Department.
Hennessy, in 1990, was named
dean of the School of Engineering.
In 1999, he took over as Stanford's
provost. And, now, Hennessy will
become the 10th president of the
University.
Indeed, his rise to presidency was
no accident. In fact, his career serves
as proof to how a commitment to this
institution can lead to great success.
Philosophy professor and soon
to-be Provost John Etchemendy
displayed his obvious admiration
for Hennessy when he described
him as "a great teacher and a bril
liant researcher, with a touch of en
trepreneur thrown into the mix. He
is the embodiment of everything
that has made Stanford one of the
world's greatest universities."
In all of these years, Hennessy

has accumulated many great mem
ories and experiences while at the
University. According to him, his
two most memorable experiences
have occurred in the classroom.
"Renovating and teaching the
undergraduate introductory
course in computer architecture
and organization, which 1 did in the
early 19905, and working with my
first group of superb graduate stu
dents on the project that became
MIPS have been very special to
me," said Hennessy.
Hennessy, 47, is marking the
path for the new millennium. When
asked if he was intimidated by such
a powerful position, Hennessy jok
ingly replied, "I'd be a fool if I didn't
have some trepidation."
Although he is uncertain how
long he will remain as president, he
will try to maintain the Stanford
legacy for years to come.
"I can't say how long I will be
president. The job has certainly be
come more demanding over time
and presidents have had shorter
terms in recent times, but it's very
hard to say until you've done the
job for a while .... My main goal
will be to make Stanford the best it
can be. This is a task that will re
quire the engagement of the entire
Stanford community: faculty, stu
dents, stafT, alumni and friends. 1
look forward to working with this
community in pursuit of these op
portunities."
What would a university be with
out continual change? With a con
tinuous shift from old administra
tion to new, a university does not
lend itself to constancy, but rather
strives to evolve with the changing
times. It attempts to create a method
where progression meets perfec
tion. Stanford, no doubt, has mas
tered this method brilliantly.
With administrative changes be
coming routine this summer, a new
group of dedicated staff will come to
the University assuming new roles
and responsibilities — all of them
eager to continue the success set
forth by their predecessors but none
of them fully aware of the incredible
task that lies ahead. The most impor
tant administrative change, by far,
will be the induction of Stanford's
10th president, John Hennessy.
Beginning on Sept I, University
President Gerhard Casper will step
down and Hennessy, who is cur
rently provost, will officially be
named as the new president of Stan
ford. Having served as president for
eight years, Casper will be replaced
by someone who has been affiliated
with the University even longer.
Hennessy, after serving the Univer

sity tor 23 years, lias proven himself
more than ready to take on the high
est position in administration and
appears to be prepared for the job.
"1 hope that we are a stronger
and better institution in the years to
come. I hope to continue the dra
matic enhancements that we have
made to undergraduate education
over the past five-plus years," said
Hennessy.
"The completion of the ('.lark
(tenter and the initiation of the Bio-
X program will significantly change
the way we pursue interdisciplinary
research and teaching opportunities
in bioscience and bioengineering,"
he added.
Hennessy's primary goal as pres
ident will be to enhance undergrad
uate and graduate education at
Stanford .is much as possible. He will
place heavy emphasis on the impor
tance of research and teaching.
"I will try to make it easier to en
courage .md support interdiscipli
nary activities both in the research
and teaching arena," said Hennessy.
"We have made and are continuing
to make a major investment in un
dergraduate education. We have also
initiated a number of new efforts to
provide many more research, honors
and independent study opportuni
ties for undergraduates."

Bui Hennessy does recognize
that improving education is merely
one aspect of being president. He
admits that his most difficult task will
be conveying to many different peo
ple how the University operates and
functions.
"Communicating with the many
diverse audiences that need to un
derstand the challenges facing Stan
ford, from students, to faculty, to
staff , to community leaders, to alum
ni, to national leaders will be ex
tremeh hard," said Hennessy.
Although the job will be verv de
manding, Stanford administrators
are more than confident th.it Hen
nessy will do a remarkable job as
president.
"All of us in student affairs are
very excited about Stanford's future
with John Hennessy as president,"
said Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Marc Wais. "John has received rave
reviews from students, staff and fac
ulty for his accomplishments as a
teacher, scientist and entrepreneur.
He is both respected and well liked
by students and is viewed as person
able, energetic and passionate about
Stanford and its students.
"His concern for the welfare of
