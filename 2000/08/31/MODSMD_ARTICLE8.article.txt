# Program readies for its second year

### BILL FALSEY EDITORIAL STAFF 
As it prepares for its second year,
one of Stanford's newest experi
ments in residential learning, the
Freshman / Sophomore College, is
making some changes.
Freshman / Sophomore college,
FroSoCo to the initiated, is housed
on Stanford's extreme west side, in
the Adams and Schiff dormitories in
Sterling Quad, and served its lirst
group of 1 SO students last year.
A five-year pilot program, FSC. is,
according to the program's Web
site, intended to provide its resi
dents with a "a broad intellectual ex
ploration of the liberal arts and sci
ences" by integrating "intellectual,
academic and social activities with
residential life.
Looking at the staff
To fulfill that promise, the pro
gram created a new type of residen
tial stall and introduced a few more
abbreviations to the standard
nomenclature. What look like Resi
dent Fellows (RFs) are actually Col
lege 1 )irectc>rs (('.I )s), and 11te rcties c>l
head academic advisors (1 IAAs) and

resident assistants (RAs) have been
combined into the all-purpose Col
lege Assistants (("As).
As FSC celebrates its first birth
day and welcomes in a new crop of
100 freshmen this September, it has
expanded from six (As to a full
complement of eight and will also be
attempting to integrate two new col
lege directors into its fold.
Last year, Adams' (IDs Sharon
Palmer and Andv Dimock, who met
while doing graduate work at Yale
in English and literature, worked
with the- now-departed ).IV and .Alli
son Shank, who were CDs in St hill.
The Shank fiunih left FSC alter J.B.
was lured away by a promising job
oiler from another university.
l'almer, who is also Director of
Freshman and Sophomore Pro
grams here at Stanford admitted,
"We'll miss the Shanks very much.
It's rather like saying good-bye to
the fabulous CA staff from last year
— sad, but inevitable." She noted,
however, that the college has al
ready recruited a new family, the
fousters, to pick up where the
Shanks left off.
"We are very much looking for
ward to working with Jonathan and
Lisa 'Pollster, however, who will be

the new CDs," said Palmer.
" Jonathan is a lecturer in the (chem
istry Department, which will pro
vide a good balance to our humani
ties backgrounds. Lisa has just com
pleted her Ph.D. in clinical psychol
ogy and will be a counselor with
CAPS [Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services] in the coming year,
rhev've got lots of ideas and plans
lor the college, and it'll be fun to ex
plore some new areas with them."
j.B. Shank, a popular Introduc
tion to the Humanities section
leader and lecturer iu Science,
Technology and Society, offered
one of FS( I's more unique opportu
nities last year. In his multi-quarter
"The Archeology of Silicon Valley."
Shank gave FS( 1 members (and en
rolled students who were not living
iti FSC'■), a chance to learn about the
history of Stanford and the sur
rounding Silicon Valley.
Whether through field trips to
neighboring semiconductor compa
nies, in symposia on issues sur
rounding the California grape crop,
during his showings of PBS's "Tri
umph of the Nerds" or even in the
address delivered by Steven Wo/.ni
ak (an übernerd and co-founder of
Apple Computer), students were

given ,i chance to realh appreciate
the perpetuity of die area surround
ing their school.
While Shank s departure will
preclude that class Iroin being ol

The Freshman / Sophomore College is located in the Adams and Schiff dorms.
fered by the program or have mis
understood how they operate. Class
enrollment is completely voluntary,
and enrollment in them is open to
non-FSC members. FSC members
are given priority for enrollment,
while, significantly, all class events
(field trips, movie showings, lec
tures) are open to any FSC mem
bers, regardless of whether or not
they are taking the class.
Some Stanford students have
been war) of FSC because of its per
ceived Structural Liberal Educa
tion-like attributes, which these
classes can give the impression of.
But the comparison is a weak one.
Palmer, who in addition to being
a CD serves as director of the Uni
versity's Freshman and Sophomore
Programs department, noted,
"FroSoCo differs from SLE in that
there is no mandatory shared cur
riculum and that none of its activities
are required of participants. 1 .ike
SLE, we hope to create an intellectu
al community in the residence, but
the programs here tend to be very
much shaped b\ the interests of the
students living in the dorm and the
student staff rather than being based
on a core curriculum."
And Dimock was quick to point
out that that difference has a mea
surable effect on the character of
events. "Dorm events have to be fun
or compelling if we want to draw a
crowd, because no one's required to
be there."
()ne ex-SI ,E junior added, "Any
one with half an idea about those
two programs would never make a
strong comparison. The only real
similarity is that they are both resi
dential. On that note, Robinson
with its environmental theme or
Ujamaa with its ethnic theme are as
comparable."
Bravman ended the discussion

on an optimistic note, "It concerns
me that some will form such
strong opinions without much
knowledge of the program, but as
time passes, I think people will
have a clearer notion of what we
are trying to accomplish."
Successes of the program
SLE-comparisons aside, certainly
it is universally admitted by staff, stu
dents, and critics alike that one as
pect of FSCs academic program
ming has been a huge success: the
Dean's Dinners.
Offered as often as possible, the
Dean's Dinner program involves
inviting popular and influential fac
ulty members to give hour-long ca
sual talks to FSC members on basi
cally whatever interests them. The
result last year was that man) pro
lessors gave enthusiastic and inter
esting talks on their personal re
search or hobbies, and their enthusi
asm resonated with the students.
After a talk concludes, I he invited
faculty member joins a do/en or so
lucky lottery winners for dinner at
Bravman's home.
Palmer cited the dean's dinners
as one of FSCs greatest successes.
"I'd say the dean's dinners were ex
ceptionally successful, both from the
student and the faculty perspective.
We've heard rave reviews from the
faculty, who really enjoyed the for
mat and the conversations they were
able to have with students both in
their talks and over dinner."
For bis part, Bravman noted that
the program "had a great first year
in terms ofbringing a large number
of faculty to the college — over 100
faculty visited." Bravman lias cham
pioned increasing student-faculty
interaction in the freshman and
sophomore years, and his efforts
seem well appreciated.
To help students feel more com
fortable interacting with faculty,
Bravman has even mastered the art
of the backyard grill, sporting his

chef's apron and repeatedly inviting
FSC members to his house for Sat
urday barbecues. (Ricker, the pro
gram's dining hall, does not serve
food on the weekends.)
Incoming freshmen seem to
have had their interests piqued by
tlie program; the number request
ing to live in FSC exceeded the
number of freshman beds (around
100). And while those students
were filling out Stanford accep
tance cards, around 90 of last
year's batch of freshmen were re
questing some sort of priority to
live in FSC again. After the Draw
and the accompanying assigning
of numbers, fates and fortunes had
been completed, about half of last
year's freshmen were slotted to re
turn as sophomores, leaving only
15 slots for non-FSC 1 sophomores.
Their enthusiasm is key to the
program's continuing success. "We
believe," said Dimock, "though it's
hard to measure at this point, that
we've gotten a great start on build
ingan identity for FroSoClo, with the
returning sophomores as a part of
our foundation. We think the sense
of continuity will be valuable."
In fact, FSC managed to retain
two of its sophomores as well. Ju
niors J.R. Fpplet and Kenny Garret
applied and were chosen to serve as
('As for the program this year.
And it is worth noting that
though many did not return to FSC!,
their departure was, for many, not
an easy choice.
Gerad Suyderhoud, a sopho
more who elected not to return to
the program was drawn away not so
much because he found FSC in any
meaningful way lacking, (he noted
that many of his strong friendships
will continue), but mentioned the
program's most cited drawback, its
location.
Suyderhoud elaborated, "It was
very difficult to drop by friends that
one had met outside of the dorm
(whether it be in class or in extracur
ricular activities). It was impossible

to really just stop-in on the way
back from class because we were on
the west side of campus, and most
freshmen were on the east side.
Many of my friends and acquain
tances from outside the College
found it likewise difficult to drop
by for the same reasons."
However, his overall impression
is still very positive. "The (College is a
wonderful idea and was very well
implemented. There were some dif
ficulties in the programs due to the
fact that il was the first year. For in
stance, the Oral communication
component of the program never
got in full swing. Otherwise, I was
impressed with the mam benefits of
living in FIOSOCO. The (lean's din
ners were amazing. Dean Bravman
was an amazingly warm and gener
ous person. Living with sophomores
had many benefits, and their tute
lage was very helpful."
Concerns to be addressed this year
Two of Suyderhoud's com
plaints, proximity toother freshmen
and the Oral Communication pro
gram, are issues which this year's
stall has decided to lot us on. While
the program obviously cannot phys
ically move, Eppler, an economics
major, is hoping that as a CAhecan
help improve the existing commu
nity within the program and foster
better relationships with its west side
neighbors. "We will strive for a more
cohesive atmosphere in the college
but are also looking to help create a
stronger west campus community
among the frosh in Roble and Lag."
Eppler's comment also refers to
the program's need for additional
programming geared to the sopho
mores, the part of FSCwhich Dean
Bravman has said requires the most
improvement.
All involved admit the Oral
Communication program did not
really get off the ground last year.
Plans for this facet of the program
were somewhat derailed when

the then-oral communication
consultant left Stanford to join an
Internet startup.
But losing staff members is not
expected to dampen the pro
gram's renewed efforts 1111> vear,
and two new staff'members are al
ready gearing up to bring the ()ral
Communication program to lull
operation.
Jennifer Hennings, a sopho
more returning to FSC, will be this
year's residential Oral (Communi
cation (Consultant (OCC), ( barged
with helping develop residents'
presentation confidence and skills.
She will be aided by Joyce Moser, a
newly hired staff'member, who has
taught literature and composition
courses, holds a law degree and
who will serve as the program's
Oral (Communication I utor
(OCT).
While the details are still being
hashed out, the two anticipate
Election 2000 debate-watching
parties, workshops on interview
ing skills and other issues ol inter
est, as well as individual consult
ing and videotaping, all aimed at
helping residents inastei the art
of presentation.
Do the evolution
It is, perhaps, this spirit ol sell
required improvement and inno
vation which is now motivating
the forces behind the Freshman
Sophomore College. As the pro
gram progresses it continues to
adapt and define itself — and its
denizen seem ready to go along
for the ride.
As Bravman told The Daily in
April, "I think students have, in
the main, been pleased. Most stu
dents have liked most ol what we
have done, and many are very
happy with the program so lar.
With that as the prevailing atti
tude, all signs indicate that the
Freshman / Sophomore (College
experiment is, so far, a su< cess.
