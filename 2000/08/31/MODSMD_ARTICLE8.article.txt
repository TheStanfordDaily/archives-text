### BILL FALSEY EDITORIAL STAFF 
As it prepares for its second year,
one of Stanford's newest experi
ments in residential learning, the
Freshman / Sophomore College, is
making some changes.
Freshman / Sophomore college,
FroSoCo to the initiated, is housed
on Stanford's extreme west side, in
the Adams and Schiff dormitories in
Sterling Quad, and served its lirst
group of 1 SO students last year.
A five-year pilot program, FSC. is,
according to the program's Web
site, intended to provide its resi
dents with a "a broad intellectual ex
ploration of the liberal arts and sci
ences" by integrating "intellectual,
academic and social activities with
residential life.
Looking at the staff
To fulfill that promise, the pro
gram created a new type of residen
tial stall and introduced a few more
abbreviations to the standard
nomenclature. What look like Resi
dent Fellows (RFs) are actually Col
lege 1 )irectc>rs (('.I )s), and 11te rcties c>l
head academic advisors (1 IAAs) and

resident assistants (RAs) have been
combined into the all-purpose Col
lege Assistants (("As).
As FSC celebrates its first birth
day and welcomes in a new crop of
100 freshmen this September, it has
expanded from six (As to a full
complement of eight and will also be
attempting to integrate two new col
lege directors into its fold.
Last year, Adams' (IDs Sharon
Palmer and Andv Dimock, who met
while doing graduate work at Yale
in English and literature, worked
with the- now-departed ).IV and .Alli
son Shank, who were CDs in St hill.
The Shank fiunih left FSC alter J.B.
was lured away by a promising job
oiler from another university.
l'almer, who is also Director of
Freshman and Sophomore Pro
grams here at Stanford admitted,
"We'll miss the Shanks very much.
It's rather like saying good-bye to
the fabulous CA staff from last year
— sad, but inevitable." She noted,
however, that the college has al
ready recruited a new family, the
fousters, to pick up where the
Shanks left off.
"We are very much looking for
ward to working with Jonathan and
Lisa 'Pollster, however, who will be

the new CDs," said Palmer.
" Jonathan is a lecturer in the (chem
istry Department, which will pro
vide a good balance to our humani
ties backgrounds. Lisa has just com
pleted her Ph.D. in clinical psychol
ogy and will be a counselor with
CAPS [Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services] in the coming year,
rhev've got lots of ideas and plans
lor the college, and it'll be fun to ex
plore some new areas with them."
j.B. Shank, a popular Introduc
tion to the Humanities section
leader and lecturer iu Science,
Technology and Society, offered
one of FS( I's more unique opportu
nities last year. In his multi-quarter
"The Archeology of Silicon Valley."
Shank gave FS( 1 members (and en
rolled students who were not living
iti FSC'■), a chance to learn about the
history of Stanford and the sur
rounding Silicon Valley.
Whether through field trips to
neighboring semiconductor compa
nies, in symposia on issues sur
rounding the California grape crop,
during his showings of PBS's "Tri
umph of the Nerds" or even in the
address delivered by Steven Wo/.ni
ak (an übernerd and co-founder of
Apple Computer), students were

given ,i chance to realh appreciate
the perpetuity of die area surround
ing their school.
While Shank s departure will
preclude that class Iroin being ol
lered next year, one of FS( '.'s other
unique offerings, one taught jointly
by Vice Provost lor Undergraduate
Education and Dean of FSC. John
Bravman and Andy Dimock on war
films (a class which met in Brav
in.in s home located jiist across FSC
on Santa Teresa St.) most likely will.
And Dimock has already volun

teered to keep up the Shank's popu
lar "Sunday night \-Files legacy
