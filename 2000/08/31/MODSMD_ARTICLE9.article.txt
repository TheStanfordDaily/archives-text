# $24 million awarded to Med Center for heart research
## 
### VICTORIA DAVIS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last Tuesday, the Stanford Med
ical Center was awarded a $24 mil
lion dollar grant bv the Donald YV.
Revnolds Foundation. The grant,
which is to be equally distributed
over four years, will help to fund re
search in order to find a cure for
artherosclerotic heart disease, which
is the leading cause of death in the
I Hited States.
The Medical Center is only the
second site to be awarded a
Reynold's foundation grant dedicat
ed to heart research. The first was
awarded to the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center at Dal
las in July 1999. The two centers are
expected to become the core of four
to six similar centers.
()ne of the goals of these centers is
to provide a strong network ofcen

ters dedicated to making significant
advancements in the quest to discov
er a cure lor heart disease. Although
significant progress has already been
made in the treatment of heart dis
ease with regard to new drugs and
other (onus of intervention, scientists
do not yet know about the genetic
basis of the disease, said Dr. Thomas
Quertemous, chief of Stanford's Di
vision of Cardiovascular Medicine.
The genetic focus of the Stan
ford Center "will take advantage of
the human genome project and
other current initiatives to provide
the greatest hope for advanced di
agnosis and treatments for individ
uals with heart disease," said
Quertei mous.
Stanford's Reynolds Center will
establish a collaboration between re
searchers at Stanford Medical ('en
ter, the Kaiser Permanente Division
of Research in Oakland, the

Lawrence Berkeley National Labo
ratory and the Framington Heart
Study in Massachusetts. These other
facilities will help in the design and
execution of various experiments.
Although some may assume that
the grant will aid in the physical
building of a research center at Stan
ford, Quertermous notes that the
center will be a virtual one. "The
grant will fund the research of scien
tists by using existing facilities," said
Quertermous.
Quertermous and Dr. Mark
Hlatky, chairman of Stanford's De
partment of Health and Research
Policy, will be the co-directors of the
new center. Other Stanford faculty
who will be involved with the new
center include Dr. Stephen Fort
mann, director of the Stanford ('.en
ter for Research in Disease Preven
tion, and Dr. David Cox, co-director
of the Stanford Human Genome

Center.
The large grant will provide the
funds to make significant headway
into the determination ol the genetic
basis of heart disease through clinical
research. In the future, large-scale
clinical research studies will be con
ducted in the Bay Area and other
surrounding areas. Quertermous
feels that the studies will provide the
critical information needed by re
searchers to make dramatic im
provements iu patient care.
When researchers determine
which genes cause the disease, they
can then effectively test individuals
and evaluate their genetic material.
Fhe knowledge of this information in
conjunction with known risk factors
such as diabetes, high blood pressure
and smoking will allow physicians
and researchers to "aggressively treat
and extensively council the patients,"
Ouertermous stated.

Dr. Eugene A. Bauer, vice presi
dent of the Medical Center and dean
of the Medical School, has lauded the
vision and philanthropy of die
Reynolds Foundation and looks for
ward to the success of Stanford's new
center. "The Reynolds Foundation is
truly making a difference in the un
derstanding of cardiovascular dis
ease," said Bauer. Bauer predicts
that Stanford, with its proxiinit\ to
the biotechnology industry and col
laboration with other centers, w ill be
a leader in the light to find .1 lor ,1
cure for heart disease.
