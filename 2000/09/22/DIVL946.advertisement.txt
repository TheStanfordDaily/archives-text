Student Advocacy & Voice
Aspiring to a University for Students
The ASSU is actively working towards student
representation at all levels of decision making by
establishing participation on Stanford's Board of
Trustees, increasing community center funding,
developing resources for student-initiated
coursework, promoting public service education,
and encouraging dialogue across communities on
issues of diversity at Stanford. We need your
voice to be heard-your voice is our power.
