When IFritzJ Maytag dropped out of
Stanfordgrad school in '65 and
bought the tattered remains of a bank
rupt brewery, people told him he was
crazy.
... The beer is a quirky remnant of
the Gold Rush days, when there were
braveries all over the city making beer
in large open vats for thirsty Forty-
Niners. The fermenting beer's rising
condensation in the cool air gave it the
name — steam beer.
... The brewery and its method
were so ancient that once Maytag
began cranking out his own beer, he
had trouble convincing people it exist
ed.
'Anchor Steam Beer?" would-be
buyers would say. "That place is out of
business, son."
... Maytag is proud of what he
and his small but hardy brew crew
have pulled off. So please do not refer
to this business as a rich kid's hobby.
