groups need onl) designate a president, have five
other student members and register a statement
of purpose with the (Mice of Student Activities.
Oflicial groups need to open membership to
the entire Stanford community. But not every
group on campus is ofliciallv associated with

group without registering with the University.

Stanford student can do. whether or not the
group seeks oflicial status.
