Dish regulations overbearing, hypocritical
In reference to the new regulations for the Dish,
I )irector of ('.ommunity Relations And\ ( '.oe says, "We
are attempting to strike a balance between habitat con
servation, environmental restoration and recreational
use. The best vva\ to do that is to ban all dogs from the
area."
I his strikes me as illogical. (-an someone explain to
me e\,t(tl\ vvh\ tins is the "best" way? Judging by this
statement, dogs are the number one threat to the envi
ronment at the 1 )ish. ( learK. this is absurd.
I honesth cannot see an\ environmental damage
that dogs, even unleashed dogs, could truh do at the
I )ish. I he onh "wildlife" to be seen .it the I )ish consists
ol ground squirrels, and I doubt that dogs do tlietn
much harm. Dogs hardh trample vegetation — cer
tainh not to the extent that humans do. And might 1
.idd that, il the I niversit) continues to graze cattle at
the I )ish wbile enloK ing a ban on canines, the admin
istration will be guiltx of the most blatant and ridicu
lous hvpocrisv. I .ilk about environmental damage!
I have not heard tins last point addressed anvwhere
,uni(l the I niversitv s sanctimonious blather about
habitat conservation and environmental restoration.

li looks like Stanford reallv means business! This
morning we were greeted at the Alpine Road entrance
to "the Dish" at Stanford In two guards, one of whom
was anned with a iruu and a billy dub.

We cjuestioned tlu- guard about the arms and she
replied that she was a policeman and that the\ were
just there to inform hikers about the new rules.
We wondered what would have happened had we
straved from the newlv laid macadam to pick up some
ol the trash left bv Stanford's "environmental work
ers." Would we have been bashed in the head with the
club, or perhaps our knees shot out?
We had a hard time swallowing the "environmental
protection" line as we saw 10 feet on either side ol the
road had been scraped dean of am vegetation.
In m\ mote than 1") years of hiking the Dish I've
never seen anv damage done bv either humans or
dogs that would come even close to the rape ol those
lulls perpetrated In the huge machinerv used when
Stanford built a huge water tank last vear and now
again. Does Stan lord even believe their own line?
