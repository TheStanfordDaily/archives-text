Back to college: independence, parties and .. .
MP3s?
Don't worry, Stanford students. II school officials
continue their current course of action. Napster,
everyone's la\orite quasi-legal online music-sharing
program, will not be shut down. At least not by t lit*
University, that is.
()n Sept. ('), 1 loward K. King, the lawyer represent
ing Metallica and Dr. Dre in lawsuits against Napster,
sent letters toStanlbrd and more than two dozen other
colleges, asking them to ban access to the San Mateo

startup.
In Stanford's letter,
addressed to former Uni
versity President Ger
hard Casper, King wrote,
"I believe that you can
easily recognize the irony
of encouraging your siu
dents to matriculate in
the creative arts, while en
gaging in behavior which,

if line becked, will make ii impossible for those students
to earn an income from their future creativedibits.
"Put simply, we believe that Stanlbrd has a moral,
ethical and legal obligation to take appropriate steps to
assure that it is not a willing participant in and an en
abler of the theft of'intellectual property through Nap
ster."
King asked the universities to respond by today but
is not threatening legal action.
Stanlbrd has alread) sent a succinct response.
"Your letter provides no legal authority and pre
sents no factual basis for your request that Stanford
University 'ban access by [its] community to Napster,' "
wrote William F. Abrams, a lawyer representing ilu-
University, in a letter to King on Sept. 13. "Stanford
has no involvement in the alleged infringement de
scribed in your letter."'
Abrams did write that if Metallica or Dr. Dre find
any particular instances of copyright infringement by
SUNet users, they can contact Stanford's I FSS Securi
ty Office to investigate any suspected violations.
Many students have praised the school's decision to
allow Napster.
