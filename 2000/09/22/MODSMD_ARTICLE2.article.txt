Back to college: independence, parties and .. .
MP3s?
Don't worry, Stanford students. II school officials
continue their current course of action. Napster,
everyone's la\orite quasi-legal online music-sharing
program, will not be shut down. At least not by t lit*
University, that is.
()n Sept. ('), 1 loward K. King, the lawyer represent
ing Metallica and Dr. Dre in lawsuits against Napster,
sent letters toStanlbrd and more than two dozen other
colleges, asking them to ban access to the San Mateo

startup.
In Stanford's letter,
addressed to former Uni
versity President Ger
hard Casper, King wrote,
"I believe that you can
easily recognize the irony
of encouraging your siu
dents to matriculate in
the creative arts, while en
gaging in behavior which,

if line becked, will make ii impossible for those students
to earn an income from their future creativedibits.
"Put simply, we believe that Stanlbrd has a moral,
ethical and legal obligation to take appropriate steps to
assure that it is not a willing participant in and an en
abler of the theft of'intellectual property through Nap
ster."
King asked the universities to respond by today but
is not threatening legal action.
Stanlbrd has alread) sent a succinct response.
"Your letter provides no legal authority and pre
sents no factual basis for your request that Stanford
University 'ban access by [its] community to Napster,' "
wrote William F. Abrams, a lawyer representing ilu-
University, in a letter to King on Sept. 13. "Stanford
has no involvement in the alleged infringement de
scribed in your letter."'
Abrams did write that if Metallica or Dr. Dre find
any particular instances of copyright infringement by
SUNet users, they can contact Stanford's I FSS Securi
ty Office to investigate any suspected violations.
Many students have praised the school's decision to
allow Napster.

"I think the University's deci
sion not to ban Napster is great,'
sophomore Ariel Jakobovits said.
"The music industry, Dr. Dre
and Metallica can take care ol
themselves. The\ can take their
case to conn, and if Napster gels
banned, then Napstei will just dis
appear. and ii won't be Stanford's
issue to take that service awa\ from
its students."
In April, Metallica and Dr. Die
filed cop\light infringement law
suits against the popular file-shar
ing program, naming Southern
California. Yale and Indiana I ni
vei sit \ as defendants, while leaving
room lor more colleges to be
added. I hose three universities
banned Napster last year, and
were subsecjuentl\ dropped as de
fendants.
" I he [YaleJ administration
didn't really sav much about |ban
ning Napster], said Jeremy
Hogan. Â«i sophomore at Yale.
" I liev just said that Napster was
overusing the school's bandwidth,
so they blocked it."
While bandwidth congestion
has been a problem .it Stanford,
school officials believe that tlie\
should not single out Napster.
"We have seen a lot ol tralHc
from the dorm network, more
than we can < onvcnienth handle,'
s.iid Stephen Hansen, Stanford's
computer security oflicer. "Steps
were taken oxer the summer that
will hopelulh take< are of the prob
lem."
A (iartner ('.roup studv released
in late August showed that .'VI per
cent, or 17 of '">() colleges and uni
versities surveyed, have decided to
ban Napster, including Arizona
State, New York I niversin and
Kent State I niversitv. Harvard,
Princeton, Columbia, I'CLA and
IC-Berkele\ are among the
schools tli.it continue to allow ac
cess to Napster.
()n ()(t. 2, when the I .S. Ninth
Circuit C'.ourt ol Appeals plans to
hear Dr. Dre and Metallica's case.

Napster might be shut down per
manently. In July, Marilyn f'atel, a
federal judge in San Francisco, is
sued a preliminary injunction
against Napster, but the appellate
court issued a Slav of thai order
until the court can hear arguments
from both sides.
Many Stanford students and
professors believe that the court
will do an injustice il it sides with
the musicians.
"While I leel that Napster has
undoubtedly had negative effects
on the recording indusln in terms
of sales, if Napster were to be
banned, it would be disastrous for
the American Silicon Valley men
tality,'' sophomore Jon Classman
said.
" I here are a number of other
countries which do not have regu
lations that would ban a service
sin Ii as Napster. A lot of our Inter
net commerce might move over
seas."
Law School l'rol. Lawrence
Lessig submitted a briet to the
court urging that Napster not be
shut down.
Robert K. Hall, a professor of
economic sand a senior fellow at
the I loover Institution, has helped
Napster analyze the financial as
pect ol the case. I fe argued that the
injunction against Napster would
not prevent the recording industry
from losing profits.
Law School l'rol. Paul Goldstein
wrote an art it le in I lie New York
1 imes, stating that even if Napstei
is shut down, the technology will
still exist, and the music industry
will have to find a wav to keep up
with the new changes.
W hen Yale blocked Napster,
students still found wavs to down
load M l\Ss from a varietx ol other
search engines, including Scour,
Gnutella, i.Mesb, CuteMX and
Freenet.
Stanford students plan to do the
same.
"If Napster gets banned, I'll just
hopscotch mv wa\ around the
other music-trading services, like
iMesli, who isn't going anywhere
considering it's in Israel, and Lars
and Dre have no sav over there,'
Jakobovits said.
