### DEENA SKOLNICK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Alter eight months of const ruc
tion, the renovated St an lord post of
fice in White I'laza opened on Aug.
21, lour weeks ahead of its deadline.
Chris Christollcrson, the associ
ate vice provost lor facilities and the
provost's oflicc liaison between Stan
lord .ind the post ollice, said he is
"cautiously optimistic" about the
new post ollice.
"My sense isthat with the opening
of the new remodeled facility there
[has] been ... some significant focus

on customer service," he said. "Tliev
put in place a lot ol things that could
imprc )\e service."
Christollcrson cited the expand
ed row of parcel lockers to solve the
problem of long lines .it the package
window.
I he post office will oiler the same
shipping and delivery services with a
lew improvements
"It's now a p<>stal retail store." said
Ray Chan, the station manager lor
the post office. "It's no longer the
standard post office that you're used
to."
In addition to stamps and pack

ing supplies, I lie post oHice now sells
postal collectibles, memorabilia and
special edition stamps. It also lias
sell-service and vending machines
lor stamps and supplies.
According to Kddie Masangcay,
manager of customer services for the
post oHice, the new facility is more
space-e 11 i< ien t.
I lie p< istal carriers once stationed
inside the old post oflice have been
moved to the main branch in Palo
Alto, giving the Stanford branch
more room lor the new men liandise
and for increased handicapped ac
cess.
While students in wheelchairs will
have no problem getting around the
new l.icilitv,other st udentson w heels
will.
Because of the glass v\ all that now
surrounds the boxes, bikes and
Rollerblades are not allowed inside
the new building. Five doors on
three sides of the post ollicc are left
unlcxked 24 hours a day.
The early opening of the post of
lice was a welcome relief alter the
problems ol the temporary facility
on lx'vin Field.
Two investigations into p< >st ollicc
procedures Ix'gan last spring alter a
student photographed a post ollicc
worker throwing first-class and time
sensitive mail into a trash bin.
1 bird-year law student Fv (Re
venger, who was instrumental in
pressing ( barges against the post of
fice last vcar, said that no one was

criminally charged in the Postal In
spection Service investigation.
As a direct result of the investiga
tion, several post ollicc employees
were fired, transferred or demoted,
(lhan himself was hired only a lew
weeks ago to replace the lormer sta
tion manager.
According to (lhan, all of the
other post ollicc employees under
went "extensive training" lor the
new lac ilit \ . I "lit* majority ol the stall
is the same as the one .it the tempo
rary lac ility.
Despite the sleek new building
and its host of postal supplies lor sale,
some students are still skeptical
about how many problems the new
post ollicc will solve.
"Replacing the building will not
help tlie wait times much," said
sophomore Cindy Keeler. "Replac
ing the stall is the necessary condi
tion."
('.hristollcrson said it will lx' diffi
cult to judge the suc c ess of the new
facility until school starts, and the
post ollic c has to handle a larger vol
ume of students, faculty and their
mail.
" I he new post ollicc seems to lx
running very smoothly, which is
good news lor undergrads," Cle
vc ngcr said.
I le added that graduate students'
mail is delivered to their residences
and that these mail routes, based out
of the Palo Alto post office, arc still
losing and misplac ing mail.
