sponsibilities that e.ii li ol us has as an American
citizen, he said.

"I have no idea how mam people on campus
are currentK registered, but I believe that it is
ver\ low, said sophomore I lealhet I largrcaves,
the project's volunteei coordinator. "I am sure

that our generation as a whole does not vote in
high numbers; I would like Stanford students to
realize that the best \\a\ to get their voice heard is
bv voting."
Seniot Brvan I lughcs, the Stanford Democ
rats' communications director, agrees.
"We want to change the college culture to
make registering to vote as much a l iteol p.issage
.is getting a driver"s license or niov ing awa\ from

petialh with the balance of power in the
