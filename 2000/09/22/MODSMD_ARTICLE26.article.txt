### MARK BOUCHER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanlord retained us sixth
place position in U.S. News Sc
World Report's 2001 ranking of
American "national universities,"
sharing the spot this year with the
University of Pennsylvania.
Princeton took the top spot in
this year's rankings while 1 larvard
and Vale tied for second place.
Caltech placed fourth, and Mil
placed fifth. Stanford received the
highest score in the country for
academic reputation, sharing the
rating with four other schools.
The magazine uses a combina
tion of several quantitative factors
to determine a numerical ranking
for each school. I he largest factor
is academic reputation, as ranked
by presidents, provosts and deans
of peer schools. Other factors in
clude graduation rales, student
selectivity, financial resources and
alumni donations.
This year, the magazine
changed its methodology to incor
porate the ratio of undergraduate
to graduate spending and to re
duce the weighting of pet-student
spending.
Former University President
Gerhard Casper has challenged
the rankings in the past, sending a
personal letter to the magazine's

editor in 1996 questioning the
rankings. The letter expressed
skepticism that the quality of'a uni
versity can be determined statisti
cally, a common criticism of the
rankings.
"Surveys do not capture what I
think is most important â€” the
quality of the educational experi
ence," said Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs James Montoya.
An article in the this month's
Washington Monthly also cast
doubt on the rankings, saying that
schools change their programs
only to improve their standing in
the survey.
A 1997 report by the National
Opinion Research Council also
criticized the magazine's numeri
cal ranking system, even though
U.S. News had commissioned the
Council's report. The report said
that the magazine's ranking sys
tem lacked "any defensible theo
retical or empirical basis."
The report also suggested
that U.S. News analyze more
thoroughly the statistical vari
ables it used and use multi-year
averages of the data to eliminate
any other short-term, haphaz
ard errors.
U.S. News argues that retain
ing the same methodology would
limit its ability to improve the rat
ings. Last year, the magazine in

eluded a cost-of-living adjustment
in its calculation of faculty salaries
so rural schools would not be at a
disadvantage.
"There is enough national
skepticism about the ratings that
most college-bound students and
parents do not make decisions
based simply upon them," Mon
toya said.
"On the other hand, we are a
ratings-oriented, status-conscious
society, and I do think [the rat
ings] influence the thinking of
some prospective students."
Montoya said the national
rankings could particularly help
small, lesser-known, top-tier liber
al arts colleges such as Pomona,
Williams and Carleton.
"Certainly, our ratings have
not had a negative impact on the
number of applications," Montoya
said.
