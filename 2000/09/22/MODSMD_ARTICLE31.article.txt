## Stanford corrals Longhorns, upends No. 5 Texas, 27-24 
### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Remember this date: September 1 f>,
2000.
For the remaining three years of his
college career, Chris Lewis will look
back loudly on Sept. 16 as the day he
came of age as a Division I quarterback.
The numbers lie put up weren't pret
iv: 12-for-33, 214 yards. Some of the
passes weren't either. Lewis won't re
member that, though — the only tiling
he'll remember is that special feeling
that comes only after leading the Stan
ford football team to a conie-lroni-be
hind 27-24 win over then-No. 5 Texas.
Of course, had starting quarterback
Randy Fasani not left the game with an
injury to his left knee early in the first
quarter, Lewis, a redshirt freshman,
never would have gotten to toss three

touchdown passes, including the game
winning 15-yarder to Deßonnie Pitts
with just I minute, 12 seconds remain
ing.
Considering Lewis had thrown only
three passes in his career, head coach
Tvrone Willingham and his staff were
sureh hoping he wouldn't be put in
such a position.
"It's very difficult to come in against
the caliber of team we played,but he did
a great job," Willingham said. "Anytime
you have the opportunity to defeat a
top-10 team, a top-five team, it's special.
1 onight is the biggest win we've had."
I n all fairness, the difference between
this vear's I exas game and last year's 00-
17 Longhorn smackdown of the Cardi
nal was concentrated mostly on the
other side of the football for Stanford.

Johnson and senior tackle Willie

I loward, the Cardinal defense harassed

The effort stood out in marked con

heat and let Longhorn receivers run
wild. Junior safety lank Williams was
among those victimized early and often.

about last year's game," Williams said.
"There was a little revenge on our
minds. But we knew we couldn't win un
less we played hard and played smart."
