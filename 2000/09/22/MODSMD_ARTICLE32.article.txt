## 
### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Anytime you score a victory over a top-5 team, it's usually
worth a day or so of blissful relaxation and celebration alien it's
back to the grind.
Safe to say that wasn't the case after Stanford's shocking
upset of then-No. 5 Texas last Saturday, during which t lie Car
dinal lost their only experienced quarterback, redshirt junior
Randy Fasani, to a knee injury. Without Fasani, I lie team's toi
let live experience at QB consists of 36 pass attempts during
two games by redshirt freshman Chris Lewis, .ill during the
2000 season.
After the game, Stanford toadies hoped that whatever in
jury Fasani had suffered would only cause him to miss a cou
ple games at the very least, but the results of early tests are not
encouraging. While the Stanford athletic department dis
closed only that Fasani had a tear of the meniscus in his left
knee, published reports indicate a more serious injury to the
knee's anterior cruciate ligament (AC L). Typically, a torn A( !L

requires eight to nine months of recovery following surgery,
meaning Fasani would miss the rest ol the '2000 season.
Coach Tyrone Willingham declined to reveal more infor
mation about Fasani's condition, saying onl\ that Fasani will
undergo arthroscopic surgery on the knee on Sept. 20, thedav
lie fore the Cardinal takes on Arizona at home.
Offensive coordinator Hill Diedrick will probably simplify
the team's offensive philosophy for Lewis, who onh has one
year's exposure to the offense in comparison to Fasani's three.
Against Texas, Lewis showed why he was considered the
top prep quarterback in the nation following the 1098 season,
making several impressive throws and leading the Cardinal
back to win with less than two minutes remaining in the game.
Moving up to the backtip spot is true freshman I evo John
son, the brother of senior outside linebacker Riall Johnson.
Teyo Johnson was expected to redshirt the 2000 season in
order to get accustomed to the ( animal s oflense and was like
ly to join the basketball team in October its a power forward,
but it now appears that will be put off for this year.
