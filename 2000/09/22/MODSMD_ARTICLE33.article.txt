# Dominating defense propels soccer to undefeated start

### JONATHAN STULL EDITORIAL STAFF 
Junior defender Lee Morrison will he
the first to admit that the next few weeks
will he the true lest of the Stanford soc
cer team's ability.
"We've been playing pretty well, but
the hulk o( our schedule is coming up,"
said Morrison, who was chosen as a pre
season All-American along with senior
goalie Adam Zapala. "It's all about the
last 15 games."
1 his afternoon's game against St.
Mary's (2-4-0) begins a two-week stretch
that will see the Cardinal take on non
conference foes No. 19 San Jose State (5-
0-0), Seton Hall (4-2-0) and Cincinnati
(2-4-0). 1 hen, in a span of two days,
Stanford opens the conference season
against Washington (3-3-0), rated as
high as No. 10 in the nation during the
preseason, and UCLA (4-0), the consen
sus No. 1 team in the country.
Still, the first five games of this 2000
season have been impressive in their
own right. While racking up a perfect 5-
0 record, the Cardinal — which has
scored 23 goals and allowed none — has
been nothing short of dominant. In fact,
Stanford is one of only two NCAA Divi
sion I schools that has yet to allow a goal.
Some of that success has been reflect
ed in the recent rankings. The Cardinal
now stands at No. 7 in the Soccer Amer
ica poll. No. 11 in Soccertimes.com and
No. 21 in the National Soccer Coaches
Association (NSCA) poll. But the rank
ings surely would have been higher il the
five teams Stanford has beaten (Xavier,
Western Kentucky, San Francisco, Har
vard and Dartmouth) didn't have a dis
mal combined record of'B-17-3. Wins in
the next few weeks will take care of that.
This year also brings the most difli
cult conference schedule the Cardinal
has ever seen. California, Oregon State,
UCLA, Washington and Stanford all
broke off from the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) to join the Pa
cific 10 Conference. While only live
squads deep, the "Pac-5" should be one
of the most competitive leagues in the
nation. While the top-ranked Bruins
lead the conference along with Stanford
and Washington, Cal was rated as high
as No. 15 in 1999 and Oregon State
upset No. 3 Portland on Saturday.

But if Stanford can keep up its excep
tional level of play, the opponent might
not even matter.
The defense, anchored by Zapala and
Morrison, one of 15 preseason candi
dates for the 1 lermann Award as the best
college player in the nation, has been
rock solid.
Zapala, a fifth-year senior, is further
establishing himself as the besl goalie in

Stanford history. Zapala's three
shutouts have extended his school
record to 39 and lowered his school
record career goals-against-average to
0.60.
"[ZapalaJ will be a pro next year,"
Morrison said. "I Ie hasn't had to do too
