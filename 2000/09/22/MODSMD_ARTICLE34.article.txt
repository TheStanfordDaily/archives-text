# Wild season in store for Stanford
## 
### SAMEER AHMED EDITORIAL STAFF 
I he Stanford football team's
win against then-No. 5 Texas
seems inexplicable.
This is the same team that
gave up 40 points a week earlier
to lowly San Jose State in a dis
heartening defeat at home. Cou
ple tlu- loss with the fact that the
Cardinal hadn't beaten a team
ranked in the top ten in seven
years, and things were not look
ing good tor Stanford.
If that wasn't enough, six min

utes and S\ seconds into the
game, starting quarterback
Randy Fasani injured his left
knee and was forced to leave the
contest when Texas defensive
end Maurice Cordon sacked him
fora 15-yard loss. Putting in
sophomore who lias completed
only one pass in his college c a
reer. against a team like Texas is
usuallv not the best ingredient
for success.
Two and a half'minutes later,
the Cardinal's luck changed.
Lewis threw up a 37-yard bomb
in the end /one to sophomore

Luke Powell, who made a leap
ing Walters-esque grab for the
first six points of the game, and
the Stanford fans were sensing a
major upset.
"You've just got to do it,"
Lewis said. "There's no real pres
sure at all. You've just got to exe
cute, and that's what we did."
Stanford's defense frustrated-
Texas coach Mac k Brown, who
spent most of the evening trying
to decide which quarterback to
play, All-Big 12 starter Major Ap
plewhite or his highly touted
backup Chris Simms. To
Brown s dismay, neither one was
very eflective until the fourth
quarter. Applewhite completed
only IS of 40 passes and was in
tercepted twice by junior Ryan
Fernandez. Simms was 3-of-6
and played sparingly through
out the second half.
Texas couldn't gain any mo
mentum on the ground either.
Running back Hodges Mitchell
rushed for only 52 yards on 19
c arries, while the team combined
for only Inet rushing vards.
I his from an offense thatdeci
mated the Cardinal lasi year in a
09-17 blowout in Austin. But
they just couldn't put together a
sustained drive Saturday. The
Cardinal defense forced Texas
punter Kris Stockton to punt a
career-high 1 1 times.
"[Our defensive perfor
mance] tonight shows what we
c an do," head coach Tyrone Will
ingham said after the game. "I!
we come out with the right ener
g\ and the right focus, this is
what we're capable of doing."
II Stanford's defense contin
ues its dominating play, and
Lewis matures into a solid quar
terback, Year 1 P.R.B. (Post Rose
Bowl), could change from the
season without Walters, Husak,
Bore hard and now Kasani, to an
ot her unpredictable four
months, where the Cardinal
could fight for its second Pac-1()
( hampionship in a row.
