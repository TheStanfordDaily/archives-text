# Depth leads runners back to top of polls
## 
### BEN ALLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last season, which culminat
ed in a fourth-place NCAA fin
ish tor the Cardinal men, was
billed as a "rebuilding year." A
third-place showing tor the
women at nationals was nothing
less than a disappointment.
Consider it symptomatic of
Stanford's cross-country perfec
tionism.
Though the expectations still
run high, the Cardinal seem
likely to measure up and record
one of the Farm's most produc
tive seasons ever.
Preseason polls — which
Stanford Director of Cross
Country Vin Lananna makes a
habit of ignoring — rank the
Cardinal women No. 1 and the
men No. 2, just behind
Arkansas (though the Cardinal
matched the Razorbacks' 8 first
place votes).
What is impossible to ignore,
however, is Stanford's unparal
leled depth, which surely cata
pulted the Cardinal to the top of
these rankings. Both squads
add star recruits to solid corps
of trail-tested harriers.
The women will have to de
fend their lofty perch through a
long season, but they appear to
have the necessary firepower.
"Without a doubt, we have
three leaders on this team in (se
nior) Julia Stamps and (sopho
mores) Lauren Fleslunan and
Erin Sullivan," Lananna said.
Stamps, a three-time All
American, is one of the Cardi
nal's most highly decorated
runners ever, while Fleshman
and Sullivan made a big impact
as frosh with fifth and seventh
place finishes, repectively, at the
NCAA meet.
The final four positions on
the team are vet to be deter

mined, but redshirt junior
Llena Villareal and freshman
Jilli.tn Mastroianni staked early
< laiins on a pair of spots with a
1-2 finish last week in Fresno,
where the top three did not
compete.
()ther challengers for the top
seven should include juniors
Caroline Annis and I.aura
I inner and redshirt freshman
Lindsay I lyatt.
fop recruits Victoria Chang
(from Hawaii), Katherine Hoff
man (Kansas) and Lauren
Gustalson (Millbrae) may be
called on to contribute as well.
"Depth will be the key for lis
as the season moves along,"
Lananna said.
The men's squad may have
an even more difficult time de
termining its top-flight squad.
I he process, in fact, mav not be
complete until November
2()th's NCAA meet.
Surprisingly enough, the
Sydney vacations of redshirt ju
nior Cabe |ennings and senior
Michael Stember, both of Whom
will compete in the Olympic
l,r>()()-meter race, will do little
to dilute the Cardinal talent
pool.
Stanford returns a full com
plement of runners to the trails
this year, having only graduat
ed All-American Jake Maas
from the fold. All-Americans
Thomas Murle\ and Jonathon
Riley return to lead the pack
which has been waiting patient
l\ to tap a well of 'voting talent.
Sophomores Adam 1 en
forde, Andy Powell and Seth
I lejnv are expected to swoop on
the open spots along with red
shirt freshman Louis Luchini
and junior |esse I'homas.
