And just like that, the school year is
upon us again. Football and rosy
cheeked freshmen are in the air,
and suddenly we have afternoons
filled with sorter and nights savoring volley
ball.
I o the newest Cardinal fans among us, we
extend a hearty welcome to The Greatest
Show On Earth, a.k.a. the Stanford athletics
program. You know the numbers: six Sears
Cups, 88 national championships, defending
league champions in prett\ mu< h everything,
yadda, yadda.
What you don't know are the little things.
I he squeak of basketball shoes on the hard
wood in Maples. Heckling field hocke\ refer

That's why 1 stick around — to catch the lit
tle moments. In the fall, everything seems pos
sible, and almost everything is.
The trained eye, though, learns to recog
nize patterns after a few years of watching the
I louse I hat fed Built at work. Accordingly, I
present this year's predictions lor Stanford

athletics. They're pretty sale
bets:
• At least a hundred fresh
men will be mortally embar
rassed during orientation
when a family member asks
their new varsity-athlete
roommate lot an autograph.
• Stanford students and
alumni will return from the

Sydney Olympics with mote medals than
eighty percent of the globe's countries. \\ liic li
is impressive until you realize the athletic de
partment's budget is larger than ninetx per
cent of the globe's countries' GNP.
• Another inajoi news publication will insist,
against all measurable evidence, that l uone
YVillingham has a pitln and uproarious sense
of humor and 112 un.
• At least once a day. someone will sav. "V\ ait
— we have squash courts?"
• llnfounded and vicious judgments ol per
sonality will be rendered and lifelong lends
begun over the calling or non-calling of a
charging lbul in an early-season intramural

basketball game.
• (Hub sports at Stanford will continue to
place nationally, field some of the school's best
all-around athletes, fund their own equip
uient through phone-a-thon shifts and t-shirt
sales, and most of us will continue never to
liear about it. unless we live with a club athlete,
in whit li case we will hear about it every day.
• Ai least once a day, someone will say, 'Wait
— we have a bowling team?"
• Cal football fans will do tens of thousands of
dollars of damage to their own field after Big
(lame, whether they win or lose.
• An employee at the Stanford Athletic Hall
of Fame will stress about where they're going
10 lii the latest damn national championship
trophy and will think about simply using it to
serve punch.
• New Stanford President John Hennessv
will appear .it a men s basketball game in.i 6th
Man shirt and mingle with students. Rowdier
fans will attempt to lift him into crowd-surfing
position, probably cracking his skull in the
