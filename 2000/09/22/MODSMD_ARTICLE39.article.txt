the 200-meter butterfly, and her name ahead of
Susie (VNeill, Australia's "Madame Buttei ll\,"
the defending Olympic champion and world
record holder.
No one could believe it, especial!) 1 Ivman,
who almost quit swimming in Mav. But on the
podium, she couldn't stop beaming, even as she
sang the "Star-Spangled Banner" with her
hand on her heart and the gold medal around
her neck.
"I wanted to savor the moment, take it all in,"
I Ivman said. "M\ whole life I've thought about

and there it was."
It wasn't supposed to be like this. ()i so Aus
