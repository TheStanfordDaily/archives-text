### MEREDITH ROWE EDITORIAL STAFF 
After serving 23 years as presi
dent of the Stan lord Alumni Asso
ciation, William Stone will step
down once a successor for the po
sition is found. University Presi
dent John Hennessy announced
last week.
Stone will still maintain his
close ties to the University in the
position of consultant to Hen
nessy. a job that will involve advis
ing and input on special projects.
"I've taken a modest leap to a

daredevil op
portunity, "
Stone said. "It
will be interest
ing to see how
the future un
folds."
Stone leaves
behind an orga
nization that
has more than

doubled 111 size during his tenure,
from 30,000 to 75,000 active
members.
The budget has increased from
several million dollars to $30 mil
lion. according to Marie Earl, di
rector of alumni relations, who
has worked with the Alumni Asso
ciation for several years.
Just two years ago, the organi
zation was not affiliated with the
University, but in 1998, the two
merged.
Earl calls the merging of the
Alumni Association and the Uni
versity one of the hallmarks of
Stone's career.
"It was a really hard situation,
but he's managed to do a good
job, even though we've just em
barked upon the work there,"

Earl said.
"We're all trying to get used to
the idea of the alumni association
without hill," she added.
"He's been such a fixture and
very much the person who's estab
lished our culture and maintained
our culture."
Since the merger, the Universi
ty has begun the construction of
the 115,000-square foot Frances
C. Arrillaga Alumni Center, which
will replace the Bowman Alumni
1 louse as the Alumni Association's
headquarters.
Construction on the new build
ing, located on the site of the old
Band Shak, sluuild be complete by
December.
Featured in the new center will
be facilities for use by visiting
alumni, including a two-story
"great hall" designed to accom
modate 400 people for meals or
700 in theater-style seating.
Another of Stone's main initia
tives during his service was re
shapingclass reunion activities, fo
cusing on more interactive oppor
tunities rather than parties.
Since 1992, attendance at re
unions has doubled, as have alum
ni contributions.
Earl said Stone directed these
changes in a professional manner,
yet always maintained a sense ol
humor and fun.
"lie encourages us to do our
best work," she said. "He deserves
a break. 1 le's been working really,
really hard."
Stone said he has enjoyed his
term as president, though he
looks forward to streamlining his
responsibilities.
"I've been in this assignment for
more than two dozen years," he
said. 'There's still a lot to do. It
seems like somebody who's willing
to commit for the long haul might
bring more energy and fresh ideas
