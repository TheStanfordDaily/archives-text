M P3: Whodat?
Without any sort of compression, it would lake
10 megabytes to represent just one minute ol CI)
quality music. Multiply iliis by about lour minutes
for your average track, and you get 10 megabytes.
Even if there weren't all this fuss over the ethics <>l
Napster and its kith, would vou realh sit in front ol
your computet lot the hours needed to download
that monster?
For most of us, the answer would be an emphat
ic "no." Indeed, in the wake of great Napster de
bate over the sharing of music over the Internet,
the public has ceased to locus on the most impor
tant technological leap that made music-sharing
programs viable in the first place — the- MPEG-1
Layer 3 (or, more commonly, MP3) compression
standard.
Development of MP3s
The Motion Picture Experts Group audio stan
dard is a high-complexity, high-compression and

high audio quality algo
rithm. The MPEG de
velopers that work on
standards for both
audio and video systems
saw the benefits of the
digital representation of
audio data. These ad
vantages include high
noise immunity, stabili
ty, reproducibility and
the efficient implemen
tation of audio process
ing functions through a
computer.
MPEG is a working
group that was formed

from the existing Joint Photographic Kxperts
Group. lis goal is to devise <i suitable encoding
sthenic for transmitting moving pictures and
sound over various broadcast links and recording
them in standard digital storage media. Since mov
ing pictures are often accompanied In sound.
MPEG also defined a standard for encoding audio
information. In 1992, a standard for audio and
video encoding was devised known as M PL( i-1.
MPS stands for MPEG-1 Layer S. Layers repre
sent a family of coding algorithms. Layer I has the
lowest level of complexity. Layer 2 requires <i more
complex encoder and decoder and is directed
more towards applications where one encoder
serves many decoders. Thus. Layer 2 is able to re
move more signal redundancy than Layer I. Layer
Sis again more complex and extracts more redun
dancy and irrelevancy from the data. Ihe layers
are backwards-compatible, meaning that any soft
ware or hardware capable of decoding Layer S
audio should also be able to decode Layers I and 2.

The nitty-gritty of MPS compression
Without am sort ol compression, it would hike
10 megabytes to represent a minute ol (11) quality
music. Hut by using MI'KG audio coding, the si/e
can be shrunk clown In a factor of twelve without
losing am ol the sound quality.
Though Ml' 3 compression is considered 'lossy'
because some data c annot be recovered alter com
pression, the MIM,(. algorithm can achieve trans
parent or perc eptuall\ lossless compression. Alter
testing, it was concluded that expert listeners could
not distinguish between coded and original audio
dips even with a six to one compression ratio.
M f\S compression is siu cess In I because it utilizes
the concept ol auditor) masking. 1 his type of
masking occurs when the presence of a strong
audio signal makes weaker audio signals in the
proximity imperceptible. 1 Ins non-linear and
adaptive threshold of hearing (the level below
which the human ear cannot differentiate between
certain sound frequencies) varies with frequency,
as well as among individuals.
Whether a person hears a sound or not depends
on the frequencx of the sound and whethet the am

plitude is above or below
thai person's hearing
threshold at that fre
quents . For example, in
the vicinitv ola loud
noise su< li as an airplane
passing overhead or a
train passing by, il is im
possible to hear ordi
nary conversations due
to the distortions pre
sent at the hearing
thresholds of the indi
viduals. Sounds that are
inaudible due to dynam
ic adaptation ol the
hearing threshold are

said to be masked.
I his effect is particularly relevant to music . A
loud ore hestra easily masks the sounds of some in
dividual instruments playing softly. Similarly,
when this orchestra is recorded, the masked in
struments will not Ik- audible to the listener. A lin
ear recording, in order to achieve efficiency,
should discard the inaudible data and instead use
ih.it space lo store other audible data. Drawing a
parallel to digital audio compression, in order to
achieve efficiency, an M I'M should drop the inaudi
ble areas of data and, in that form of compression,
save space.
When sounds are digitized, the computer grabs
all the sound and stores it as numbers. Lven if parts
of the sound are beyond the range of human hear
ing, thev're digitized anyway. MPS compresses the
file by removing any numbers representing sounds
bevond the range of human hearing.

What makes MPS so special?
So why has MPS emerged as
the leading tool for Internet
audio delivery? MPECi-1 Layer 3
is defined as an open standard, so
the specification is available to
anyone interested in implement
ing the standard. Since no single
company owns the standard,

public example source code is
available and the format is well
defined.
Also, driven bv the demand for
professional and, moreover, per
sonal use. main MPS encoders
and decoders are readily avail
able for use. I his access simplifies
the adoption of M PS tec hnologv.
The widespread increase in
usage of computers lasi enough
to decode audio and with lasi In
ternet access have both con
tributed to the embracing of M PS
music format.

As data compression technolo
gy advances, there are bound to
be faster, higher-quality alterna
tives to the M PS format. Real Ne
tworks alreadv touts such a for
mal, but has ac hieved nowhere
near the übiquity of MPS.
As of now, " M PS" is one of the
most popular search keys on the
Internet, surpassed only by the
word "sex." According to a recent
PL Magazine article, the MPS
music marketplace reached the
magic 10-million-user threshold
in 1099 and continues to grow.
