# Decoding the human genome
## 
### GUHA JAYACHANDRAN 
In the mid-1980s, scientists
started considering the possibility
ol mapping the human genome. In
June 2000. the deed was pro
claimed done.
At a White I louse function to
commemorate the announcement.
President Clinton declared the
product to be "the most important,
most wondrous map ever pro
duced b\ humankind.
In between the two events lie as
tounding s( ifiiiilic breakthroughs
and fascinating human intrigue
and competition.
When, in 1953, James Watson
and Francis ('.rick discovered the
strut Hire of I)NA, the\ never ex
pected to see it full\ decoded in
their lifetimes.
Watson and ( rick tlitl predict
that duplication was possible, how
ever. In <i 1953 Nature article ex
plaining their work, thc\ wrote, "It
has not escaped our notice tli.it the
specific pairing we have postulated
immediately suggests a possible
copying mechanism lor the genet it
material."
They focused mail) on under
standing how the four nitrogen
bases (A, I, G, and C) code amino
at it Is in the synthesis of proteins.
Just three decades — and a few
major breakthroughs — later.
Watstiii had become an earl\ advo
cate ol the Human Genome Pro
ject, an immense, publicly financed
undertaking whose goal would be
to sequent e the approximately
three-billion DNA letters that com
prise the human genetic code.
.Vt its formal inception in 1900.
the project's founders sought to se
quence the genome by 2005. They
used a relatively straight forward
method for genome sequencing.
First, scientists divided the
genome into 22.000 segments
whose positions were mapped.
The segments were then cloned
many times for rcdunancy. Auto
matic gene sequencers decoded
the clones' genetic makeup, The
prticess was repeated several times
It) ensure completeness and accu
racy. Eight years after the project
began, just seven percent of the
genome hat I been sequenced.
Enter Craig Venter. In 1991.
while working for the National In
stitutes of Health. Venter pub

lished a paper dctailinga new, vast
ly more ell it ient method lor identi
fying genes. Venter and some NIII
officials wished to patent the genet
it material. I lowever, Watson, who
then headed the project for the
Mill, felt that attempting to patent
the genes Venter (list tneretl would
lead to extensive legal complica
tions.
Nil I did not patent the genes.
Rebufled. Venter lelt the gov
ernment and accepted an oiler
from a venture capitalist to start his
own research lacilitv.
Venter used a method similar to
shotgunning to sequence
genomes. Shotgunning is used to
sequence simple genomes. As op
posed to the aforementioned \ 11l
technique, whereby DNA is divid
ed into segments whose positions
are known, shotgunning shreds
the molecule into tiny fragments.
I lie fragments are then t loncd and
put through a gene-sequencing
machine.
Immense computational re
sources are required to determine
where the fragments meet. For
even small parts of a genome, this is
tlillit ult.
Nobel laureate 1 lamilton Smith
urged Venter to applv the shot
gunning method to determine the
makeup an entire genome. This
idea became known as whole
genome shotgunning. By 1995,
the two had decoded the entire
genome ol the bacteria that causes
ear inlet lions and meningitis.
Critics argued that whole
genome shotgunning resulted in
less accurate data with unaccept
able gaps in the gene sequence.
Venter set out on his own to
prove them wrong, and, in part
nership with PF Hiosystems, start
ed Celera Genomics in 199.5.
Gelera comes from lor
quick, and speed was Venter's gt >al.
Venter realized the importance ol
speed in the development of the
human genome even before treat
ing Gelera. Commenting on the
new company, Venter said, "The
stMiner researchers can access the
information contained in the com
plete human genome, the stumer
new therapies can be developed lor
the thousands ol disorders in
whit h genes pla\ a role."
Me prtxlaimetl he would se
quence the human genome b\

2001 at a cost of $200 million, as
opposed to the project s original
projection of 2005 for billion.
The publicly financed operation
felt t he pressure. They shifted theii
target i<> 2003, with ;i rough draft
by 2001.
At the beginning of litis year,
Venter promised ,i rough draft In
summer, and debate intensified.
CSclera's scientific standards were
criticized, as was its practice of
patenting genes (although Venter
lias said he will eventualh allow
free use).
Francis Collins, director ol the
Mil's National Human Cenonie
Research Institute', understood
Venter would soon announce ( '.el
era had completed sequencing. In
\pril. the Nil I and Celera grudg
ingly agreed to a joint announce
ment ol the accomplishment. Ynd
the race was over.
Willi onl\ <t rough ctrnfi of the
genome in hand, ethical issues
stub as ac t ess. piopertx rights and
diversitx are alreach coming to the
forefront. Scientists continue work
ing to produce a final, more accu
rate, more complete sequencing of
the genome. Lven before the draft
was completed, though, re
searchers were using the results to
search lor remedies to previously
unt reatable diseases.
Already, doctors can use a per
son's genetic information to sci ecu
his susceptibility to certain ailments
and advise those with high risk on
possible preventative measures. In
the future, such tests will undoubt-I
edly grow in number. Also, physi |
cians may one day be able to pre
scribe medication that is custom
formulated lor patients' particular
genetic makeup.
However, the bulk of the work
in putting genetic knowledge to
use siill lies ahead, and most ex
perts agree ili.it the real benefits
will not appear lor decades. Most
will s.i\ ih.it ii is the vast potential
lor good, more than am competi
tion. that makes the decoding ol
the genome significant.
As Venter proclaimed at tlu 1
White House this summer,
" Today, June 20, 2000 marks an
histori< point in the 100.000-year
record ofhunianitv." And Collins'
olt-staled words should be noted as
well: "The only race involved here

As Venter proclaimed at tlu 1
White House this summer,
" Today, June 20, 2000 marks an
histori< point in the 100.000-year
record ofhunianitv." And Collins'
olt-staled words should be noted as
well: "The only race involved here
is the human race."
In the mid-1980s, scientists
started considering the possibility
ol mapping the human genome. In
June 2000. the deed was pro
claimed done.
At a White I louse function to
commemorate the announcement.
President Clinton declared the
product to be "the most important,
most wondrous map ever pro
duced b\ humankind.
In between the two events lie as
tounding s( ifiiiilic breakthroughs
and fascinating human intrigue
and competition.
When, in 1953, James Watson
and Francis ('.rick discovered the
strut Hire of I)NA, the\ never ex
pected to see it full\ decoded in
their lifetimes.
Watson and ( rick tlitl predict
that duplication was possible, how
ever. In <i 1953 Nature article ex
plaining their work, thc\ wrote, "It
has not escaped our notice tli.it the
specific pairing we have postulated
immediately suggests a possible
copying mechanism lor the genet it
material."
They focused mail) on under
standing how the four nitrogen
bases (A, I, G, and C) code amino
at it Is in the synthesis of proteins.
Just three decades — and a few
major breakthroughs — later.
Watstiii had become an earl\ advo
cate ol the Human Genome Pro
ject, an immense, publicly financed
undertaking whose goal would be
to sequent e the approximately
three-billion DNA letters that com
prise the human genetic code.
.Vt its formal inception in 1900.
the project's founders sought to se
quence the genome by 2005. They
used a relatively straight forward
method for genome sequencing.
First, scientists divided the
genome into 22.000 segments
whose positions were mapped.
The segments were then cloned
many times for rcdunancy. Auto
matic gene sequencers decoded
the clones' genetic makeup, The
prticess was repeated several times
It) ensure completeness and accu
racy. Eight years after the project
began, just seven percent of the
genome hat I been sequenced.
Enter Craig Venter. In 1991.
while working for the National In
stitutes of Health. Venter pub

lished a paper dctailinga new, vast
ly more ell it ient method lor identi
fying genes. Venter and some NIII
officials wished to patent the genet
it material. I lowever, Watson, who
then headed the project for the
Mill, felt that attempting to patent
the genes Venter (list tneretl would
lead to extensive legal complica
tions.
Nil I did not patent the genes.
Rebufled. Venter lelt the gov
ernment and accepted an oiler
from a venture capitalist to start his
own research lacilitv.
Venter used a method similar to
shotgunning to sequence
genomes. Shotgunning is used to
sequence simple genomes. As op
posed to the aforementioned \ 11l
technique, whereby DNA is divid
ed into segments whose positions
are known, shotgunning shreds
the molecule into tiny fragments.
I lie fragments are then t loncd and
put through a gene-sequencing
machine.
Immense computational re
sources are required to determine
where the fragments meet. For
even small parts of a genome, this is
tlillit ult.
Nobel laureate 1 lamilton Smith
urged Venter to applv the shot
gunning method to determine the
makeup an entire genome. This
idea became known as whole
genome shotgunning. By 1995,
the two had decoded the entire
genome ol the bacteria that causes
ear inlet lions and meningitis.
Critics argued that whole
genome shotgunning resulted in
less accurate data with unaccept
able gaps in the gene sequence.
Venter set out on his own to
prove them wrong, and, in part
nership with PF Hiosystems, start
ed Celera Genomics in 199.5.
Gelera comes from lor
quick, and speed was Venter's gt >al.
Venter realized the importance ol
speed in the development of the
human genome even before treat
ing Gelera. Commenting on the
new company, Venter said, "The
stMiner researchers can access the
information contained in the com
plete human genome, the stumer
new therapies can be developed lor
the thousands ol disorders in
whit h genes pla\ a role."
