## Frosh invade campus: Class of 2004 arrives University set to greet 1,602 new faces from all states, many nations 
### EILEEN CHAO EDITORIAL STAFF 
It's the start of another year: a time lor
new friends, new classes, new explo
rations. And, like am other year, it's a time
when the campus is filled with thousands
of exuberant new faces — the faces of the
freshman class. This weekend, 1,002 new
students will step onto campus as the ('.lass
of 2004.
As part of a class that had one of the low
est acceptance rates (13 percent) in Stan
lord history, main freshmen take special
pride in their enrollment.
"I am really honored to be part of this
class, knowing that it was so difficult to be
accepted,'" said freshman Julian Snyder. "I
guess it's really the (ream of the crop."
Sophomore Nikki Sickles, the New I n
dergraduate Student Information Project
junior coordinator, helped pair freshman
roommates this summer and agreed that
the Class of 2004 is a highly skilled one.
"They're really smart and diverse,"
Sickles said. "You hear the administration
say how talented they are, but reading
through forms about their accomplish
ments make you really see that it's true."
I he number of freshman in the ( lass of
2004 is significantly smaller than last year's
entering group of freshmen. I he I niver
sity was bursting at the seams in (all 1099,

with the arrival of 1,750 new students.
Given the extremely tight housing situa
tion for undergraduates. Vice Provost lor
Student Allans fames Montova felt the re
duction in c lass si/e was necessary.
"()ur yield lor the c lass of 2003 was un
expectedly high," Montova said. "This
year we admitted 300 fewer students with
a target of 1,000 freshmen. We are coming
m right on target."
I he smaller class allowed the Universi
ty to reverse last year's drop in transfer stu
dent acceptances. I his year, I 1 I transfer
students were admitted and 81 are matric -
ulating.
"We are back on track with our transfer
student admission." said Assistant Dean of
Undergraduate Admission Holly Hale)
Knapp. "Last year, because of the large
number of freshmen students who en
rolled, we were only able to oiler admis
sion to 29 transfers."
Compared to the 200 students in her
high school class. 1.602 students sounds
like a large class to freshman Grace ko.
However, she's glad that the numbers
have gone down from last year.
"I'm excited about my class being small
er." Ko saic l. "Maybe it would make it eas
ier to get to know every one."
Snyder admits he probably wouldn't
have noticed a smaller class size if someone
hadn't pointed it out. lie feels comfortable
with the number of students at Stanford.
"When 1 was deciding where to go, 1
didn't want to go to a really small school
where there was no diversity, nor a ver\
large school where everyone is a stranger."
Snyder said. "To me, Stanford's student
body is just right."

I S News and World Report ranked
Stanford among the top ten most diverse
national universit\ campuses, and the
(.lass of 2001 supports this rating well.
Kighty-five of the enrolling students are
international, representing Bhutan,
Brazil, Canada. Jamaica, Korea, Mexico,
Nicaragua, Pakistan, Singapore, Slovakia,
South Africa, Switzerland, I aiwan and
I urkev, among others countries.
The largest minorit\ representation is
among Asian Americans, who make up

-20.4 percent of the incoming c lass. Blacks
make up 7.<S percent, 1.8 percent are Na
tive American and 10.3 percent are Lati
no. Despite the lower acceptance rate, the
general demographics and ethnic break
down ol the incoming freshmen have re
mained very similar to previous years', ac -
cording to Knapp.
I his international mix of students is
what freshman Janelle Jindal finds entic
ing.
"What • \cites inc. the most about Stan

lord is the people, the diverse student
body," Jiudal said.
From coast to coast, the nation was well
represented in the ('.lass of 2004.
"For the first time since 1995, all 50
states are represented in the freshmen
c lass." Montova said.
The largest percentage of American
students, 40.0 percent, came from (Califor
nia. I lie Mid-Atlantic region had the sec-

oiid largest percentage, 1 1.0 per
cent, while 9.1 percent come from
the Midwest.
Though the Class of 2001 re
tains the same levels <>l diversity
«md representation .is previous
freshman classes, the freshman ex
perience at Stanlord will he slight
ly diflerent this year due to several
new I niversit\ polities. For the
first time, freshmen will not he al
lowed to have tars on campus.
In the past, I<S percent ol fresh
men brought their cars to school in
fall quarter, and In spring, '.V2 per
cent had cars. Montova believes
this increase shows that the I'ni
versit\ doesn't provide adequate
public transportation lor its stu
dents, an area he hopes to im
prove.
"As we expand the Marguerite

(the oil-campus mass transit sys
tem), we're hoping that more stu
dents will use it [without feeling as
if they] look stupid," Montova
said. "We're really having to work
hard at Stanford to trv to create a
more eiivironmeniallv conscious
campus ... and to get students to
use public transportation."
Along with increasing the num
ber of Marguerite routes, the I ni
veisitv is .ilso increasing funds lor
dormitories that house freshmen
and opening a car rental service.
This service will operate through
the Stanford Bookstore and will
deliver Enterprise keni-a-( ..u s to
the dormitories. It will begin latei
this year.
" I lie rental car idea is a great
idea because it'll give freshmen
more convenience to go oil cam
pus . . . that is, when we know
where to go," Snyder said.
Freshmen, .is well as all other
Stanlord students, will also be fac
ing a new alcohol polit \. < me that
will lormalh prohibit the use of
dorm funds to pin t base alcohol.

Moniova made ii clear that the
policy is not lo completely restrict
students from drinking, hut to
allow the I niversit\ to he respect -
illl ol federal legislation while re
maining focused on an education
al approach to drinking. (Please
see related ( atnpus l.ile article on
page CB.)
."The new policies related to
New Student Orientation provide
frosh with more time to think
through the issue of alcohol use
once the\ are on campus," Mon
toya said.
Whether or not freshmen de
cide to drink, worn about driving
or noti< e the diversity in their class
mates, .ill 1,602 of them will have
new experience ahead of them.
"I'm both nervous and excited
about starting out in .1 new place
and new school, but 1 know I'm
going to have a great lime," Ko
said. Tin going to have a hard lime
narrowing down the ( lasses I want
to take .ind meeting everyone, but
hopefully I'll have the time to do
every thing I wanted lo do."
