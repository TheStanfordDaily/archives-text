### EILEEN CHAO EDITORIAL STAFF 
It's the start of another year: a time lor
new friends, new classes, new explo
rations. And, like am other year, it's a time
when the campus is filled with thousands
of exuberant new faces — the faces of the
freshman class. This weekend, 1,002 new
students will step onto campus as the ('.lass
of 2004.
As part of a class that had one of the low
est acceptance rates (13 percent) in Stan
lord history, main freshmen take special
pride in their enrollment.
"I am really honored to be part of this
class, knowing that it was so difficult to be
accepted,'" said freshman Julian Snyder. "I
guess it's really the (ream of the crop."
Sophomore Nikki Sickles, the New I n
dergraduate Student Information Project
junior coordinator, helped pair freshman
roommates this summer and agreed that
the Class of 2004 is a highly skilled one.
"They're really smart and diverse,"
Sickles said. "You hear the administration
say how talented they are, but reading
through forms about their accomplish
ments make you really see that it's true."
I he number of freshman in the ( lass of
2004 is significantly smaller than last year's
entering group of freshmen. I he I niver
sity was bursting at the seams in (all 1099,

with the arrival of 1,750 new students.
Given the extremely tight housing situa
tion for undergraduates. Vice Provost lor
Student Allans fames Montova felt the re
duction in c lass si/e was necessary.
"()ur yield lor the c lass of 2003 was un
expectedly high," Montova said. "This
year we admitted 300 fewer students with
a target of 1,000 freshmen. We are coming
m right on target."
I he smaller class allowed the Universi
ty to reverse last year's drop in transfer stu
dent acceptances. I his year, I 1 I transfer
students were admitted and 81 are matric -
ulating.
"We are back on track with our transfer
student admission." said Assistant Dean of
Undergraduate Admission Holly Hale)
Knapp. "Last year, because of the large
number of freshmen students who en
rolled, we were only able to oiler admis
sion to 29 transfers."
Compared to the 200 students in her
high school class. 1.602 students sounds
like a large class to freshman Grace ko.
However, she's glad that the numbers
have gone down from last year.
"I'm excited about my class being small
er." Ko saic l. "Maybe it would make it eas
ier to get to know every one."
Snyder admits he probably wouldn't
have noticed a smaller class size if someone
hadn't pointed it out. lie feels comfortable
with the number of students at Stanford.
"When 1 was deciding where to go, 1
didn't want to go to a really small school
where there was no diversity, nor a ver\
large school where everyone is a stranger."
Snyder said. "To me, Stanford's student
body is just right."

I S News and World Report ranked
Stanford among the top ten most diverse
national universit\ campuses, and the
(.lass of 2001 supports this rating well.
Kighty-five of the enrolling students are
international, representing Bhutan,
Brazil, Canada. Jamaica, Korea, Mexico,
Nicaragua, Pakistan, Singapore, Slovakia,
South Africa, Switzerland, I aiwan and

The largest minorit\ representation is
among Asian Americans, who make up

-20.4 percent of the incoming c lass. Blacks
make up 7.<S percent, 1.8 percent are Na
tive American and 10.3 percent are Lati
no. Despite the lower acceptance rate, the
general demographics and ethnic break
down ol the incoming freshmen have re
mained very similar to previous years', ac -
cording to Knapp.

what freshman Janelle Jindal finds entic
ing.
"What • \cites inc. the most about Stan

lord is the people, the diverse student
body," Jiudal said.
From coast to coast, the nation was well
represented in the ('.lass of 2004.
"For the first time since 1995, all 50
states are represented in the freshmen
c lass." Montova said.
