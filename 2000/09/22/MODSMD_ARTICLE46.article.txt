# Odd traditions abound on Farm

### TISH WILLIAMS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
You're here, you got in, you picked out
some semi-attractive yet reasonably priced
bedding and you're getting the hang of Stan
lord.
Congratulations, \<>u made it. But now is
not the time to rest on your laurels.
As you're learning the ropes here on cam
pus. it's imperative that you learn a few funda
mental traditions. These will soon become sec
ond nature, like clapping too last and jumping
at just the right time when The One, I heOnlv,
the Trulv Incomparable, Leland Stanford Ju
nior (pause) I'Diversity Marching Band plavs
"All Right Now."
First things first: the Orientation square
dance at MuFuUnSun. Yes, it's cheesy. Yes,
you'll look likf a redneck. But get out there
.md do-si-do your liny little heart out. It will be
one of those Hallmark memories lor vears to
come, unlbrgeltable ifonly for the fact that you
actually put aside your embarrassment and
kept your laughing at the caller to a minimum.
Soon alter comes Full Moon on the Quad,

your one chance lor guilt-free tongue jousting
with a total stranger. You submit because
you're supposed to. In order to become a Stan
lord man or woman, according to legend, a
freshman must kiss a senior in the Quad under
the light of the full moon.
It's a little slea/ier and not quite as poetic as
it sounds, but be a good sport. I lopefully the
moon won't provide enough light for anyone

to recogni/e you later and incriminate you in
any way.
All llie while, you'll see and be seen at Stan
lord's one regular weekh social outing, Flicks.
I hese almost-up-to-date movie offerings
screened in Memorial Auditorium are a great
opportunity to check out male pattern bald-

ness trends among those in the or
chestra seats, as well as your one
shot to nail that obnoxious prep
school kid in vour I-Ilum (lass
during the pre-show paper fight.
Word has it that to achieve the nir
vana of true senior status one must
successfully float a paper airplane
from the balconv and hit the movie
screen.
Halloween sets the scene lor a
Ic-ss wholesome, Iren/icd rite as the
student bod\ heads on down to the
resting place of our beloved
founders and dances on their
graves. A little morbid and ungrate
ful, perhaps, but the Mausoleum
provides a perfectly eerie haekdrt >p
for the wickedness of the holiday.
Once November rolls around,
all the cosmic energy on campus
focuses on one deliriously mali
cious goal: beating C.al. Out come
the name-t ailing, the Axe wielding
and the most high-schoolcsque dis
play of Stanford spirit you will get
out of a group of semi-apathetic
smart people.

Four years ago, Stanford re
claimed the Axe — a hallowed arti
cle awarded to the winner of each
Biu (lame — for I lie 112 irst time since
1993.
Big Game Week includes many
can't-miss-or-you're-lame events
such .is Gaieties, a student-written
comedy revue that lakes the oppor
tunity to playfullv go for the (ail
jugular, Gaieties also sends mote
visible Stanford icons up in flames
in a joking, pseudo-plot filled musi
cal. And when the\ say "Branner
sucks," thev're onlv teasing. Don't
take it personally.
You also learn the Axe Cheer
(highlighted by such tricky and
c< >mplex lines as "(live 'em the Axe"
and "Right in the neck"). Although
Big (lame week has never been the
same without the lowering Bonfire
(c anc eled four vears ago because of
the endangered tiger salamander
population in the Lake Lagunita
bed), plans are always in the works
to find a "healthy alternative."
Big (lame itself is the one time
vou can do the "We (lot In ( beer
without feeling like your ego's ihe
si/e ol Montana as the Axe Com
mittee prepares to take back its
baby. On that electric night, no
matter what the score, the campus
erupts in snoo/.ing, boredom-rid

den silence as the all-day tailgates
take a toll and campus turns lame,
lame, lame.
From there, Stanford takes a
turn for the worse as everylxxly
and anybody tries to reverse I lie
dateless trend that has ( rushed the
campus under its weight. As fun as
the whole blind date concept is in
tlieorv, in reality ii proves painful as
dormitories throw Screw Venn
Roommate parties. Although you
may not meet your potential soul
mate, ii is a good way to get back at
your roommate for her snoo/e bill
ion addic lion.
And when romantic frustration
doesn't outweigh academic frus
tration — usually for the two
weeks each quarter during Dead
and Finals Weeks — another tra
dition rears its ugly head. Every
night of Dead Week, students take
part in the Primal Scream, yelling
out ol their windows at midnight,
thereby getting out I-llum read
ing frustrations and writer's-block
woes.
I hese are just a lew of the tradi
tions which give Stanford a kicked
back vet amusingly oil-beat atmos
phere. No one takes them very seri
ously now, but you'll miss them all
too soon when you undergo that
last tradition — graduation.
