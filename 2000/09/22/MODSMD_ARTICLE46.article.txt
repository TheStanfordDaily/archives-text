You're here, you got in, you picked out
some semi-attractive yet reasonably priced
bedding and you're getting the hang of Stan
lord.
Congratulations, \<>u made it. But now is
not the time to rest on your laurels.
As you're learning the ropes here on cam

moon won't provide enough light for anyone

to recogni/e you later and incriminate you in
any way.
All llie while, you'll see and be seen at Stan
lord's one regular weekh social outing, Flicks.
I hese almost-up-to-date movie offerings
screened in Memorial Auditorium are a great
opportunity to check out male pattern bald-
