# Stanfordese explained
## A 						crash course in Stanford's own, unique student language 
### JIMMY BOEGLE STAFF WRITER 
Listen up: Stanford students
speak adillerent language from the
outside world. Call it Stanlordese,
Farmonics, or (lardinalingo.
Whatever the name, you will
soon be speaking this unique
tongue. In principle, this regional
language consists of taking two or
more words and rendering them
into catchy little rhythmic smaller
words.
So, to get you hooked on Stan
lord Phonics, here is a short dictio
nary to get you through the next
lew days.
Co Ho: The Coffee House. A
traditional Stanford hangout in
I residder Union tli.it serves I bod
and drinks such as collee and
sandwiches.
Dink: Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The auditorium located across
from the Co Ho.
Flo Mo: Florence Moore Hall.
A big dormitory located just oil ol
the Row, named after a woman
named Florence Moore. She gave
Stanford lots ol money. Good
brunch. Great icecream.
Fro Yo: Frozen Yogurt Served at
the Co Po. A substitute for ice
cream. Many Californians are
scared of ice cream because it has
fat in it; thus, they eat fro yo.

Flicks there every Sunday night.
Flicks are cheap movies with paper

I his term is disliked by most stu

fordese word for it. Ro 1 fos (Room
I losts), students who host pro fros
in their room during Admit Week
end. are not to be confused with
1 lo I los (I louse I losts), who coor
dinate the dorm's pro fro ro ho ac

I o test your knowledge, look at
the following paragraph:

the ('.(> I'o to get afro vo on her way back
from MuFnl nSuti. She ran into a
112 riend that worked for lies Comp in a
building between the Co Ho and Dink.
If this made sense, congratula
tions! And if you realized that
there is no building between the
Co Ho and Dink, you're wax
ahead of the game.
