## Your most frequently asked questions â€” we answer them below 
### 
As helpful as your RA may be, your first
few weeks at Stanford can be a disorient
ing. To make your first weeks at Stanford
as worry-free as possible, we compiled
this list of answers to some of the most fre
quently asked Orientation week ques
tions:
Q: How do I pay my University bill
and ensure my financial aid?
A: To pay your bill, go to the Oak West
lounge on the second floor of Tresidder
Union. (This is only set up during orienta
tion.) If you already have a check for the
amount due, just look for the big box in
which to deposit your yellow envelope. If
you suspect an error in your bill, need to get
loan disbursements or pick up scholarship
money, there are specific counters to assist
you. But if you have questions, come early
Lines can long. For those who are lost, there
is even a "No Clue" line.
Q: What happens if I miss an Orien
tation activity?
A: Relax. Orientation programs are recom
mended but not mandatory. Every opportu
nity to get to know Stanford and the people
around you will pay off in the long run, but
things may come up that prevent you from
attending every activity. Pick the activities
that you think are important or sound inter
esting, and attend those.
Q: I)o I need to take a math, chemistry
or foreign language placement test?

A: Math: If you do not have AP credit or col
lege transfer credit and wish to take math,
you need to take the math placement test.
Those who have AP credit are encouraged to
take the test as well for placement purposes.
Math placement tests last an hour. Take
them on computers in dorm clusters. Plan to
take the test before you meet with your ad
viser. Your score, which you will get as soon
as you finish the test, is strictly personal in
formation that you use to decide which math
class you will enroll in at Stanford. Check
your Orientation calendar for times and lo
cations.
Chemistry: If you want to take chemistry at
Stanford and do not have AP credit or trans
fer credit, you should take the online place
ment exam, which also takes about one hour.
Your score is confidential and will be used
to place you in a chemistry course on cam
pus. Check your Orientation calendar for
times and locations.
Foreign languages: The University requires
all students to achieve competency in a for
eign language equal to a third quarter, first
year course. If you have studied a foreign
language and plan to take the same language
at Stanford, you need to take the placement
test to determine which class to take. Some
students have completed the written section
of the test online over the summer. The oral
exam is still required, and times for these
tests are listed in the Orientation guide. Stu
dents who have not taken the online section
should contact the department of that lan
guage.
Q: How do I find my way around cam
p us ?
A: An excellent question, because navigat
ing around an 8,180-acre campus where
every building looks vaguely like Taco Bell

can trip up even those who are handy with a
compass.
First, some words of warning: Hoover
Tower serves as a poor landmark, because it
looks the same from all four sides. Our best
advice: Carry a map with you, and don't be
afraid to ask for directions. We all did when
we were frosh.
Q: If I'm having trouble with a class,
can I get a tutor?
A: The answer is probably yes. The Center
for Teaching and Learning gets about 2,000
requests for help each year and is usually
able to accommodate them. In addition, the
CTL offers math and chemistry tutoring.
Writing tutors are also available, but stu
dents are encouraged to try to make ap
pointments for these.
In addition, many dorms have tutors, and
some departments offer tutoring for their
classes. For tutoring information, call the
CTL at 723-1326. Another option is to check
the Community Information Board near the
BASS ticket agency in Tresidder Union.
There you can find people who are willing to
tutor in various subjects, particularly for
eign languages.
Q: How do I add my e-mail address,
phone number and room number to
the directory?
A: You can add information to update
your file on the online whois system by
signing into your Axess account on the In
ternet. Once you have logged on, go to the
"Demographics" prompt. After editing
the appropriate information, make sure to
update the database. The new information
should appear within 24 hours in the di
rectory.
