## New president reflects on plans, objectives 
### RITU BHATNAGAR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
University President John Hennessy
seems like lie's almost settled into his new of
fice in Building 10. The bookshelves in his
office are still sparse, hut there's a coffee cup
and quite a hit of paperwork on the confer
ence table. 1 lis ollice intercom bu/zes inter
mittently, a reminder of the people he still
has It'll to see, even though it's close to 5 in
the evening.
Hut I lennessy seems to be adjusting well
to the many variables of his new position. As
Stanford's ('.lass of 2004 moves into its
dorms today, I lennessy is preparing to give
his first freshman convocation to a sea of new
faces, all of whom are facing a similar situa
tion to his "starting anew."
In contrast to the freshmen, who can look
forward to a brief orientation before starting
their careers at Stanlbrd, Hennessy says his
past 23 years at Stanford will help him take
on his newest role in the University.
"[l've had] a summer of working really
hard. The whole year as provost was very
much an orientation to a different level of

engagement and breadth of interaction
across the University," Hennessy said.
"Despite the fact that I've been here for
23 years and even at the level of dean of en
gineering, there's a remarkable number of
things you just don't know about, simply be
cause they're outside your scope of respon
sibility.
"This past 15 months has been an enor
mous learning experience, engaging a vari
ety of faculty, students and academics across
the institution. I suspect I probably still have
more to learn and that this year will [in
clude] more engagement (and) learning
more about the institution."
Since being named Stanford's l()th presi
dent by the Board of Trustees last April,
there has been a veritable fluttering of media
fren/.y and speculation on how the president
will bring Stanford into the new millennium.
There is particular interest in Hennessy
within Silicon Valley, both as the man who
founded MI PS and who, in his first and onlv
year as provost, reeled in a $150 million
contribution from Netscape founder Jim
Clark to kick ofTStanford's new Bio-X pro
gram.

he calls the "common misperception" that

Former Provost John Hennessy became the University's
10th president on Sept. 1.
Stanford has become a school
more geared toward the training
of future entrepreneurs and engi
neers.
"If you look at this year's fresh
man class, it's remarkable how
evenly divided they are," he said.
"There's almost an even division
between engineering, science, so
cial science, and humanities and
interdisciplinary studies. I think
that while we're delighted that
Cisco, Yahoo!, and Google had
their roots here, there's a lot more
at Stanford."
Issues ahead for Hennessy
This year, Hennessy faces an in
teresting situation similar to one
that former President Gerhard
Casper encountered when he
stepped u}) in 1993, an adminis
tration with many new faces. In
addition to the great change-over
of power in the academic dean
ships in the past two years, Stan
ford will also this year welcome
new people to the jobs of provost ,
dean of admissions and financial
aid, and dean of religious lile.
In the near future, Hennessy
hopes to name a new dean for the
Medical School and a replacement
for President of the Alumni Associ
ation Bill Stone, who will now act
as a consultant for Hennessy.
"[The new administration] is
both an opportunity and a
challenge. There's a tremendous
amount of education and sharing
among the deans and the provost,
as everyone comes up to speed,"
Hennessy said. "[We are putting]
together an agenda that crosses
the schools and talks about some of
the new things we're going to do.
We're lucky to have a number of
people, take [Provost John
F.tchemendyj for example, while
he hasn't been in a Building 10
role, has been at Stanford a long
time and has played a variety of
roles around Stanford."
Stone's role as a consultant,
which is a new position, will

involve outreach to alumni, lx)th
for development and communica
tion purposes.
"I'm hoping [Stone's] going to
be able to help me with some of the
outreach issues that we have to
alumni. He'll be another presence
that can maintain a strong contact
between the University and alum
ni," Hennessy said. " That's an on
going challenge, the biggest chal
lenge that the president has, that
there are simply 100 many things
to do, too many constituencies,
each of which could consume all
your available time. And I'm hop
ing Bill will be able to help wit 11 the
alumni constituency."
Limited numbers of people in
alumni relations and other areas
of the administration, particularly
immediate support of the presi
dent and provost, are what lead
Hennessy to characterize the cur
rent administration as "thin."
"1 think there'sa general assess
ment among the deans and most
of the trustees as well that we've
may l>e got the organization where
there simply aren't enough people
to get the job done," Hennessy
said.
"Where part of that job involves
timely decision-making, it also in
volves having enough people
around who can send the appro
priate ambassador to a meeting —
t hat's probably where our thinness
has shown the most. 1 think we'll
probably try to not dramatically
increase numbers, but [we will]
look at a couple of areas that need
improvement."
In addition to examining inter
nal concerns, Hennessy will also
need to address a number of
major issues in the form of the
General Use Permit, the U.S. De
partment of labor's investigation
into Stanford's hiring practices
and the break-up of the UCSF-
Stanford Hospital merger.
"We are continuing to cooper
ate with the Department of Labor
investigation. 1 don't know that we
know how it will go next," Hen
nessy said. "I think we're going to
try to respond to whatever criti
cisms the department may have,
and see if we can't improve our in
ternal handling of these issues."

"cost ol living and quality of life for
faculty, stall and graduate
students." He also wants to reflect
on the "achievements Casper
made in undergraduate educa
tion" and see what can be done
next.
Looking ahead
Hennessy said he feels thai
there's a "natural time span" lor
the position.
" Ten years is probahh a useful
life span. 1 think all of us wish
Gerhard would have done the job
a couple of more years," lu- said.
In looking ahead to his future
as president, Hennessy reflected
on what he thought was necessar\
fora successful presidency.
"The key to feeling good about
this job is to have some things you
want to accomplish that go be
yond the usual day-to-day run
ning of the operation. Some ol
those seeds are already planted.
Bio-X and the Clark Center is
clearly one seed I've tried to nur
ture over time and want to sec
come to fruition."
In working on his many goals,
Hennessy said he will ultimately
rely on the individuals he's
worked with at the University for
the past two decades. He calls that
support one of the job's "perks."
"People are extremely sup
portive, friendly, generous with
their time, their advice. This is
probably the great secret of being
president or provost, is that you
find that Stanford has many sup
porters, not only among people in
the institution like faculty and stu
dents, but also lots of alumni who
still regard their time at Stanford
as some of the best years of their
lives," 1 lennessy said.
"You encounter them at all dif
ferent places and settings,
whether they want to talk to you
about the recent success against
Texas or the upcoming chal
lenges facing the institution or jusi
the gieat teacher they had at one
point who changed their lives.
That's probably one of the most
rewarding things about the iob."

and quite a hit of paperwork on the confer

has It'll to see, even though it's close to 5 in

Hut I lennessy seems to be adjusting well
to the many variables of his new position. As
Stanford's ('.lass of 2004 moves into its
dorms today, I lennessy is preparing to give
his first freshman convocation to a sea of new
faces, all of whom are facing a similar situa
tion to his "starting anew."
In contrast to the freshmen, who can look
forward to a brief orientation before starting
their careers at Stanlbrd, Hennessy says his
past 23 years at Stanford will help him take
on his newest role in the University.
"[l've had] a summer of working really
hard. The whole year as provost was very
much an orientation to a different level of

engagement and breadth of interaction
across the University," Hennessy said.
"Despite the fact that I've been here for
23 years and even at the level of dean of en
gineering, there's a remarkable number of
things you just don't know about, simply be
cause they're outside your scope of respon
sibility.
"This past 15 months has been an enor
mous learning experience, engaging a vari
ety of faculty, students and academics across
the institution. I suspect I probably still have
more to learn and that this year will [in
clude] more engagement (and) learning
more about the institution."
Since being named Stanford's l()th presi
dent by the Board of Trustees last April,
there has been a veritable fluttering of media
fren/.y and speculation on how the president
will bring Stanford into the new millennium.
There is particular interest in Hennessy
within Silicon Valley, both as the man who
founded MI PS and who, in his first and onlv
year as provost, reeled in a $150 million
contribution from Netscape founder Jim
Clark to kick ofTStanford's new Bio-X pro
gram.
But Hennessy is not keen on focusing on
his technology roots, and he dismisses what
he calls the "common misperception" that


KEITH ITO/The Stanford Daily
Former Provost John Hennessy became the University's
10th president on Sept. 1.
Stanford has become a school
more geared toward the training
of future entrepreneurs and engi
neers.
"If you look at this year's fresh
man class, it's remarkable how
evenly divided they are," he said.
"There's almost an even division
between engineering, science, so
cial science, and humanities and
interdisciplinary studies. I think
that while we're delighted that
Cisco, Yahoo!, and Google had
their roots here, there's a lot more
at Stanford."
Issues ahead for Hennessy
This year, Hennessy faces an in
teresting situation similar to one
that former President Gerhard
Casper encountered when he
stepped u}) in 1993, an adminis
tration with many new faces. In
addition to the great change-over
of power in the academic dean
ships in the past two years, Stan
ford will also this year welcome
new people to the jobs of provost ,
dean of admissions and financial
aid, and dean of religious lile.
In the near future, Hennessy
hopes to name a new dean for the
Medical School and a replacement
for President of the Alumni Associ
ation Bill Stone, who will now act
as a consultant for Hennessy.
"[The new administration] is
both an opportunity and a
challenge. There's a tremendous
amount of education and sharing
among the deans and the provost,
as everyone comes up to speed,"
Hennessy said. "[We are putting]
together an agenda that crosses
the schools and talks about some of
the new things we're going to do.
We're lucky to have a number of
people, take [Provost John
F.tchemendyj for example, while
he hasn't been in a Building 10
role, has been at Stanford a long
time and has played a variety of
roles around Stanford."
Stone's role as a consultant,
which is a new position, will

involve outreach to alumni, lx)th
for development and communica
tion purposes.
"I'm hoping [Stone's] going to
be able to help me with some of the
outreach issues that we have to
alumni. He'll be another presence
that can maintain a strong contact
between the University and alum
ni," Hennessy said. " That's an on
going challenge, the biggest chal
lenge that the president has, that
there are simply 100 many things
to do, too many constituencies,
each of which could consume all
your available time. And I'm hop
ing Bill will be able to help wit 11 the
alumni constituency."
Limited numbers of people in
alumni relations and other areas
of the administration, particularly
immediate support of the presi
dent and provost, are what lead
Hennessy to characterize the cur
rent administration as "thin."
"1 think there'sa general assess
ment among the deans and most
of the trustees as well that we've
may l>e got the organization where
there simply aren't enough people
to get the job done," Hennessy
said.
"Where part of that job involves
timely decision-making, it also in
volves having enough people
around who can send the appro
priate ambassador to a meeting —
t hat's probably where our thinness
has shown the most. 1 think we'll
probably try to not dramatically
increase numbers, but [we will]
look at a couple of areas that need
improvement."
In addition to examining inter
nal concerns, Hennessy will also
need to address a number of
major issues in the form of the
General Use Permit, the U.S. De
partment of labor's investigation
into Stanford's hiring practices
and the break-up of the UCSF-
Stanford Hospital merger.
"We are continuing to cooper
ate with the Department of Labor
investigation. 1 don't know that we
know how it will go next," Hen
nessy said. "I think we're going to
