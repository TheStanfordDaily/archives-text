# Hennessy ready to lead
## New president reflects on plans, objectives 
### RITU BHATNAGAR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
University President John Hennessy
seems like lie's almost settled into his new of
fice in Building 10. The bookshelves in his
office are still sparse, hut there's a coffee cup
and quite a hit of paperwork on the confer
ence table. 1 lis ollice intercom bu/zes inter
mittently, a reminder of the people he still
has It'll to see, even though it's close to 5 in
the evening.
Hut I lennessy seems to be adjusting well
to the many variables of his new position. As
Stanford's ('.lass of 2004 moves into its
dorms today, I lennessy is preparing to give
his first freshman convocation to a sea of new
faces, all of whom are facing a similar situa
tion to his "starting anew."
In contrast to the freshmen, who can look
forward to a brief orientation before starting
their careers at Stanlbrd, Hennessy says his
past 23 years at Stanford will help him take
on his newest role in the University.
"[l've had] a summer of working really
hard. The whole year as provost was very
much an orientation to a different level of

engagement and breadth of interaction
across the University," Hennessy said.
"Despite the fact that I've been here for
23 years and even at the level of dean of en
gineering, there's a remarkable number of
things you just don't know about, simply be
cause they're outside your scope of respon
sibility.
"This past 15 months has been an enor
mous learning experience, engaging a vari
ety of faculty, students and academics across
the institution. I suspect I probably still have
more to learn and that this year will [in
clude] more engagement (and) learning
more about the institution."
Since being named Stanford's l()th presi
dent by the Board of Trustees last April,
there has been a veritable fluttering of media
fren/.y and speculation on how the president
will bring Stanford into the new millennium.
There is particular interest in Hennessy
within Silicon Valley, both as the man who
founded MI PS and who, in his first and onlv
year as provost, reeled in a $150 million
contribution from Netscape founder Jim
Clark to kick ofTStanford's new Bio-X pro
gram.
But Hennessy is not keen on focusing on
his technology roots, and he dismisses what
he calls the "common misperception" that
