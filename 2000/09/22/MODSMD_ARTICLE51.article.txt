Recentlx, Ml I was Ibiind liable lor last

out the nation.
"| I lis familv| had been able to show
Mil had been neglectful," said Vice
Provost lor Student Allans |.unes Mon

lias to take responsibilitx foi its own ac
tions."
While the I niversitx lias not xct em
braced the more extreme drinking poli
ties used .it some otliei institutions, ii will
implement three new p< >Ik ics related to al
cohol consumption. Montoxa announced
to ()rientation Volunteei s on I uesdax.
For the last two xears. Montoxa lias
been evaluating the I niversitx s alcohol
polit x through talks with students, lac nltx
and administration.
"This is one area where we are most
vulnerable in terms of our own liabilitx."
Montoxa said.
I nder the new policx', I nixersitx funds
allocated to freshman, sophomore and )ii
nior class ollic ei s lor class actix ities will not
be used for the pin < I use ol alcoholic bev
erages.
Also, alcohol w ill not be available at olli
t ial undergraduate residence ball func
tions during Orientation. Ollic ial func
tions refer to activities organized bx ic si
dence stall'or funded bx monex collet led
bx stall.
Finally, undergraduate house funds
collected bx the I nixersitx or distributed
bx the I nixersitx stall will not be used lor
the purchase ol alcoholic bexei ages.
"It's important to know that funds col
lected bx the I nixersitx, the charges put
on students' official Stanford bills, are not

being usetl i< >t pin t base ol alcohol for un
derage consumption, Montova said.
I lowever, the ollic i.il policx in the Stan
lord Bulletin doesn't outlaw group-lund
ed drinking < ompletely. It reatls," I he de
t ision it> use student collec led funds to l)uy
alt oliol slioultl be made lawlullx, thought
lullx, laiilx and in a wax that respects the
views of all students. Students must not be
required ton >ntribute to a student-collect
ed fund lot the purposes ol purchasing al

Montova siressetl tli.it Stanlord policies
emphasize etluc ating students about alco
hol. 1 hese policies respect federal legisla
tion while retaining a locus on an educa
tional approach to drinking, he said.
"I beliexe that 'education' continues to
be the best approac Ii to the t hallenges xve
lac e with ale c )hol abuse on c am pus," Mon
toxa s.iitl. "Should students choose to
drink, we want to make certain that tlicx
nuclei stand the implications ol their choic
es, and in doing so. make responsible and
thoughtful decisions related to alcohol
use.
I he new policies support recent fed
eral legislation, including I lie C.ollcgiate
Inilialixe to Reduce Binge Drinking and
Illegal Alcohol ( onsumption recently en
at ted bx ("ongress." he added.
While Stanlbrtl's ollicial alcohol polic x
dictates that those under age 21 must not
be served alcohol, even Stanlord Police
( apiain Marx in Mot ire .it knowledges that
underage thinking occurs. However,
learning from these experiences is what's
important, he said.
" I Ins is an environment where people
are learning how to make decisions,"
Motile s.iitl last xear. "and incorporated
iniooui enloi t enicnt posture is the learn
ing .ind eclut alional component. 1 he best
solution is education because it helps
xoung people understand dangerous
tli inking."
I he polite department collaborates
with the dean ol students as well as ( owell
Student Health ( .enter to educate siii
denis about alcohol, Moore said.
()ne of the missions ol the Stanford Po
lite Department is to ensure that alcohol
use does not bet tune a problem at the I'ni
vei sit x.
"Based on what I consider real, true
problems [with drinking], Stanlord does
not have more than anxbodx else," salt I

Moore. "Do we have a number of kids
doing underage thinking? Yes. Do we
sometimes have life and death situations
regarding underage drinking? Yes."
Moore believes that the key to prevent
ing problems with alcohol use is modera
tion in alcohol consumption.
"You have to have a handle on alcohol
and not let alcohol have a handle on you.
I liis all depends on moderation."
However, the polite department will
not hesitate to intervene if alcohol, or use
ol alcohol, becomes a problem.
"If alcohol is the problem, we treat it as
the problem. Hit is not the problem we do
not go out ol the \va\ to make it an issue,
he said.
"We will make arrests and issue t ita
tionsil people are blatant to flaunt it in our
face."
In addition to prohibiting alcohol con
sumption bv minors, Stanford's alcohol
polic\ also prohibits the serving of alcohol
to "obviouslv intoxicated" parlv-goers.
Stanford's alcohol policv also spawned
ihe "Stanfordspeak" term "HANAB," or
c<|iiall\ attractive non-alcoholic beverage,
lht' alcohol polic\ requires that alcohol
t annt)t be served unless "equalh attrai live
non-alcoholic beverages are made avail
able and are easih accessible throughout
voui event."
Other schools have adopted solutions
ranging from creating substance-free
housing to attempting to limit student ac
cess to alcohol.

News and World Report writes that the
