# Keep safe on campus: lock your door, bike

### FRANK GUINAN JENNIFER STEWART STAFF WRITER 
(Greetings from cheery resident
assistants, helping hands from smil
ing Orientation Volunteers and in
troductions to 100 new light-heart
ed faces. Stanford seems like a pret
ty secure place to many new stu
dents.
In making the transition to cam
pus life, however, freshmen and
transfer students often become overly
trusting and rather careless during
their first few days on the Farm.
And why shouldn't they? In a re
cent study of 58 s< hools called "(Time
at College: the Student Guide to Pub
lic Safety," Stanford was ranked one
of the lf> safest campuses in the na
tion.
But don't be fooled. Crime does
occur here on the Farm — and the at
mosphere of Orientation can be the
ideal time for crooks to make their
mark.
In most cases, however, simple pre
cautionary measures can help deter
theft from ruining a good first year.
Lock that bike
For the past decade and a half, the
number one reported crime on cam
pus has been bicycle theft.
Bike theft soared .is high as 800
bikes a year in the early- to mid-19905.
1 lowever, the number has dropped in
recent years due to a recent $1-million
project devoted to improving facilities
for bicyclists.
In 1998, nearly 400 bicycles were
stolen. Two hundred thirteen were
stolen in 1997.
Since 1995, Stanford's bicycle pro
grain has created enclosures for 550

bikes and installed or upgraded 3,000
bike rack spaces, according to the Stan
ford Report.
In addition to creating new spaces,
the program has also freed up existing
spaces by cracking down on aban
doned bikes.
Stanford Police speculate the ac tu
al number of thefts is twice the re
ported number, because many stu
dents do not bother to report their
stolen bikes.
To avoid becoming one of the many
unfortunate victims, the police advise
students to lock up their bicycles. Al
though U-locks are the most effective
locking devices, Stanford police also
recommend a safety device known as
"Had Bones," which spans the length of
the lock and can make it live times
stronger.
In recent years the Stanford Po
lice have worked to be more visible
and catch more bike thieves. Police
stress t lie necessity of registering
bikes. As Stanford Police Cap!. Raoul
Niemeyer told the Daily in 1998,
"without a victim, we c an't prosecute
[a thief]."
Dorm safety
Ideally, dorm residences should be
locked up after midnight. I his is iisu.il-
Iv not the case, however, since students
go in and out of their dorms well after
that time. Many choose to prop the
door open as thev make their earlv
morning rounds.
Fortunately, burglars do not usually
try their luck in the dorms after mid
night. Instead, many know when stu
dcnts won't be in and hit the dorms
while most students are at lunch, din
net or in the shower.
There is. however, a simple solution

to keep from becoming a statistic:
Keep doors locked whenever rooms
are empty, even if it will be lor a short
period of time. Many students keep
their keys on nametag cords that they
can conveniently wear around their
necks.
Concerns about assault
(Compared to proper!\ crime, "bodv
crime" (i.e. aggravated and sexual as
sault) is relatively rare on the Stanford
campus.
Most sexual assaults are acquain
tance (or date) rape and often involve
alcohol, sav police.

will accompam students bv motorized

can contact the free service bv calling

Perhaps the most important crime
busting tip is personal awareness and
responsibility. II a situation leels suspi
cious or threatening, change direc
tions, go to a populated area, call a
friend to meet you or call 9-91 1 from a
campus phone or 91 1 from an oil-cam
pus phone.
If you are the victim of a crime, call
the police immediately. When a c rime
goes unreported, a c riminal may attack
again. Also make sure to report anv
suspicious persons, vehicles or ac tivi
ties to the police.
