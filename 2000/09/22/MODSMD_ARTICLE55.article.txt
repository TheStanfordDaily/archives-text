# Don't wait for Screw Your Roommate
## 
### PATRICK BERNHARDT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
I his weekend, hundreds of hours will be
spent preparing ihe Stanlbrd (ilass of 200 I lor
I lie challenges awaiting them over the next
lour years. But lor the all the pomp and cir
cumstance, the message you should take away
is simple:
"Freshmen, welcome to the Farm, where the
winds ol freedom blow, everyone hates the
Weenies and no one ever dates."
There is no disputing the first two parts of
that message. There are also lew disputes with
the third. Some — in the minority — will try to
refute the third with anecdotes or In parading
about with their significant others, attempting
to prove the claim a myth.
File problem, however, is not imagined. It is
sufficiently serious to merit concern from even
the highest of Stanford ollicials. Addressing
Sophomore (College, Stanford's summer semi
nars lor second-year students, one year, Ibriner
I ni\ersit\ President (lerhard (lasper ollered
hope to the romantically disenfranchised.
"You can make a choice," Casper pro
claimed. "You can go out on a date."
Statistics would indicate ili.it the solution
might be ili.it simple. I lerant katehadourian, a
pK(lessor ol psychiatry, behavioral sciences and
human biology, conducted an in-depth,
decade-long stiidv on the Stanlbrd class of
1981.
l eu percent ol his sample set married .in
oilier Stanlbrd student. An additional 10 per
cent married someone iliev met in graduate
school — presumablv, lor some portion ol the
group, also at Stanlbrd.
However, statistics oiler little help to those
caught on the losing end — like m\ freshman
i (lommate.
Soon alter arriving on campus, niv room
mate notic ed an incredibly attractive woman in
his ('.hem M I c lass. She was, he relayed, a I're-

Med (ioddess — a I'MCJ.
He could not, however, muster the chutz
pah to ask her out. I le plotted and planned lor
weeks lor the perfect opportunity to dazzle her
with his witty banter and hopefully become her
life-long soulmate. 11 is chance finally came witli
our dormitory's annual Screw Your Room
mate.
I he SYR — its name derived from the an
cient fralernit) parties where members set up
their friends with the ugliest women iliev could
line! — is. these clays the most important social
event lor anyone seeking love. Almost every
dormitory, .it some point during the vear, will
hold one.
It goes something like this: You will convince
your roommate to ask out the date of your
choosing, and everyone will pretend it's a blind
date, ignoring the lad von didn't have the
courage lo make the dale yourself.
For the I'M(1, I recruited a mutual lemalc
friend to ask the I'NKi out lor ni\ roommate.
While I sal in ihe room, she placed the call on
niv speakerphone. I he question was posed.
I he obligatory pause was allowed while the
I\M( i and whoever else happened to be in her
room traded glances and quit kl\ dove lor the
freshman face book. ()ui ol courtesy, my ac
complice repealed m\ roommate's name and,
in delerence to Us complexity, spelled it.
1 he pause seemed to last forever. Finally the
PMCi drew in an audible breath on the oilier
end and quickly , but clearly so as not to confuse
ihe message, replied: "l'msoirvbuilhavelo
goouioltownthatwcekcndbve." Silence — and
eventually a dial lone — followed.
"Well," I said after hanging up ihe phone,
"maybe it's her grandmother's 90th birthday
"Yeah." niv accomplice replied sharing a look
ili.il did not convincingly convey her agreement.
M\ roommate look the rejection well when I
iold him, shrugging oil ihe deleal and turning
back to his calculus, but, as I discovered later, ii

weighed heavy on his mind.
Later that night, alter we had both gone to
beci, he laid staring at the ceiling. I he pressure
of class, the SYR and other things that 1 was
never lullv aware pushed him over a line. He
admitted — as many other Stanlbrd students
do — his desperation in a single sentence re
peated every night lor the next si\ months in
what, by his own admission, was the most pa
thetic time of his life.
"Pat," he whined. "1 need a woman."
I have witnessed 100 main good men and
women reach this point. For my roommate
there were other PMCJs, but none induced the
same enthusiasm.
Dellated, many victims of Stanford's social
environment, such as my roommate, never
seem to recover. They drift hopelessly through
four years of half-hearted hopes of happiness.
Bui the problem isn't irreversible. Life, un
like an honors theses, is best without extensive
planning.
My roommate spent his entire freshman
year pining over women he knew only from
afar, but Pate eventually smiled on him. Light
davs before the end of the year, he met a
woman in the most informal of settings: our
dorm lobby.
Within an hour of meeting, this woman ap
peared at our door. Before 1 could even polite
ly excuse myself, phone numbers were
exchanged and a date was made.
Despite finals, the two of them saw each
other often and successfully carried their bud
ding romance into the next year.
II seems that Casper's words might well hold
the solution to the dating problem at this uni
versity: Let go of your insecurities and Fate may
smile upon you.
II ii doesn't, you can console yourself as the
rest of us unluck) souls do. Remember, if you
don't find love in this environment, 1,600 new
freshmen arrive one year from today.

i (lommate.
Soon alter arriving on campus, niv room
mate notic ed an incredibly attractive woman in
his ('.hem M I c lass. She was, he relayed, a I're-

Med (ioddess — a I'MCJ.
He could not, however, muster the chutz
pah to ask her out. I le plotted and planned lor
weeks lor the perfect opportunity to dazzle her
with his witty banter and hopefully become her
life-long soulmate. 11 is chance finally came witli
our dormitory's annual Screw Your Room
mate.
I he SYR — its name derived from the an
cient fralernit) parties where members set up
their friends with the ugliest women iliev could
line! — is. these clays the most important social
event lor anyone seeking love. Almost every
dormitory, .it some point during the vear, will
hold one.
It goes something like this: You will convince
your roommate to ask out the date of your
choosing, and everyone will pretend it's a blind
date, ignoring the lad von didn't have the
courage lo make the dale yourself.
For the I'M(1, I recruited a mutual lemalc
friend to ask the I'NKi out lor ni\ roommate.
While I sal in ihe room, she placed the call on
niv speakerphone. I he question was posed.
I he obligatory pause was allowed while the
I\M( i and whoever else happened to be in her
room traded glances and quit kl\ dove lor the
freshman face book. ()ui ol courtesy, my ac
complice repealed m\ roommate's name and,
in delerence to Us complexity, spelled it.
1 he pause seemed to last forever. Finally the
PMCi drew in an audible breath on the oilier
end and quickly , but clearly so as not to confuse
ihe message, replied: "l'msoirvbuilhavelo
goouioltownthatwcekcndbve." Silence — and
eventually a dial lone — followed.
"Well," I said after hanging up ihe phone,
"maybe it's her grandmother's 90th birthday
"Yeah." niv accomplice replied sharing a look
ili.il did not convincingly convey her agreement.
M\ roommate look the rejection well when I
iold him, shrugging oil ihe deleal and turning
back to his calculus, but, as I discovered later, ii

weighed heavy on his mind.
Later that night, alter we had both gone to
beci, he laid staring at the ceiling. I he pressure
of class, the SYR and other things that 1 was
never lullv aware pushed him over a line. He
admitted — as many other Stanlbrd students
do — his desperation in a single sentence re
peated every night lor the next si\ months in
what, by his own admission, was the most pa
thetic time of his life.
"Pat," he whined. "1 need a woman."
I have witnessed 100 main good men and
women reach this point. For my roommate
there were other PMCJs, but none induced the
same enthusiasm.
Dellated, many victims of Stanford's social
environment, such as my roommate, never
seem to recover. They drift hopelessly through
four years of half-hearted hopes of happiness.
Bui the problem isn't irreversible. Life, un
like an honors theses, is best without extensive
planning.
My roommate spent his entire freshman
year pining over women he knew only from
afar, but Pate eventually smiled on him. Light
davs before the end of the year, he met a
woman in the most informal of settings: our
dorm lobby.
Within an hour of meeting, this woman ap
peared at our door. Before 1 could even polite
ly excuse myself, phone numbers were
exchanged and a date was made.
Despite finals, the two of them saw each
other often and successfully carried their bud
ding romance into the next year.
II seems that Casper's words might well hold
the solution to the dating problem at this uni
versity: Let go of your insecurities and Fate may
smile upon you.
II ii doesn't, you can console yourself as the
rest of us unluck) souls do. Remember, if you
don't find love in this environment, 1,600 new
freshmen arrive one year from today.

This couple didn't let Stanford's notorious non-dating reputation stop them
from getting together.
