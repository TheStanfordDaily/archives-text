# Cheap Trick rises from the dead
## 
### MICHAEL BAER STAFF WRITER 
(Iheap Trick was the most unlikely success story of 1999. liest
known lor its late '70s and 'KOs work, the band languished in die last
decade, jumping from record lalx'l to record label, try ing to regain
momentum.
Ironically enough, it was the '70s that saved them. A rocking and
somewhat unexjHtted cover of Big Star's '70s power-pop tune "In
the Street," done lor Fox's " That '70s Show" (and cruelly dul>l>ed
"That '70s Song") somehow gave them their first hit since the pre
grunge-era. Big Star fans tan only console themselves with the

Authorized
Greatest Hits W '/
Epic Records

thought that Alex Chiltin is fi
nally getting some well-de
served notoriety and royalties.
To take advantage of
this comeback, Epic/Legacy
will issue a Cheap Trick hits col
lection this September. (Greatest
hits collections are at once the

easiest and most diffi< alt records to review. After all. one doesn't re
view the artist's actual work, hut rnerelv how well they (or their record
company) have chosen songs that represent them well and sound
good together.
('.heap Trick's "Authorized Greatest Hits" — the "Authorized"
meaning it was the hand that picked these — is a somewhat mixed

bag. A lew of their hits, most prominently "I lonnd Dog," were cover
songs, but this disc consists mostly of originals. Indeed,"! lonnd Dog"
is missing, though thai other T)()s standard "Ain't 'I "hat «i Shame" is
represented.
Hit' album has different versions of several of the songs, including
an un released live version of their smash, "The Maine." Whether this
is good or had is up to the l)uyer to decide, but it is doubtful that, ii an
other collection is ever released to replace this one, the same version
will lx> used.
Ditto the "Full length Version," "Single Version" and "Alternate
Version" of songs which dot the disc. Although they work, it's sale to
assume diat using unreleased and alternate versions of songs was
Kpic's idea and not the bands's. In some cases, the live tracks work
well because of the band's famous on-stage energy, but, lor the most
j>art, it .ill seems suspiciously like a major laln-l marketing tactic (and
an unsuccessful one at that).
But the album remains a guilty pleasure, painting a relatively rep
resentative and thorough portrait ol the band, at least at its most suc
cessful (i.e. "Greatest"). Hits such as "Southern (iirls," "Surrender,"
"Dream Police,"and "She's light" are all here. Which means that, lor
now, this album is the Ix-st way to experience the career of Cheap
Trick in 66 minutes.
The album could have, and probably should have,l>een longer —
surely the most prominent mussing hits could lit on the remainder of
this disc. Knjoyable overall, but Trick fans amid likely produce a bet
ter mix themselves.

Rick Nielsen can finally afford to re-string his guitar.
