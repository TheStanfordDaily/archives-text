album from the Illinois-based indie

before the group's sudden break-up
early in And although the split

longtime I.ins, Sarge's }x»pnlai it\ in
the indie touring t in nit doesn't re
ally extend to the West ('.oast. mean
ing there's a g<xxl chance you've
never heard am ofthe songs written
by guitarist / vocalist front woman
Klizabeth Klmore.
II" this is the case, don't let "Dis
tant" pass you by. Not only does it
stand as a powerful testament to the
legacy left behind in the wake of the
band's unlimeh end, but it contains
songs that are so catchy, and yet so
sad, diat it's almost impossible not to
fall in love with both the lyrics and
musk. The contrast between Kl
inore's smooth voice and her song
lyrics, which all seem to l<xus on
troubled relationships, onh serves
to further heighten the all-around
depth ol these compositions. I can't
rememlxT the last time heattbreak
sounded this good.
The record opens with three new
tracks, demos that hint at what could
have Ixx-n had the band stayed to
gether and recorded another full
length album. I WN's" Ilic(»lass In
tact" may have l>ecn Sarge's break
through album, but the new songs
on "Distant" showcase Sarge at its

strongest, surpassing am previous
material lx>th musicallv and Ivrical
ly.
I laving already established a fbr
mula lor success on their first two al
bums, Sarge's catchy hooks, |>op
sound, and insightful brio are in
lull force, especially on "Distant V
third track, "( Hearer." TTiis song fo
cuses on emotional instability,
which, like main of Sarge's songs,
creates a tone lhat is at once both bit
let and accepting. "Now I mark
each new morning by whose bed I
climbed out of last." Klmore sings, as
she tries to decide whether or not
her head isactualh clearer during a
post-breakup state that feels all too
familiar.
llie track "Detroit Star-lite" doc
uments how one's music interests
can come before his relationship
commitments, as evidenced by the
song's chorus refrain "when Detroit
Rock C.itv stalls getting ahead, he'll
leave you." And on "the end of'jub,"
a slower piece, Klmore considers
how a lift between two lovers can
parallel the breakup of a band. "I've
never l)een good at Distant, but I'm
getting better," she admits, al
though it is evident thi> distance is
what will ultimatch end what's at
stake, hand-related 01 otherwise.
Apart from the new songs, the
album also has six live tracks, three
covers and two semi-acoustic 1111111-
Ih'l's, creating what Klmore tails 111
the liner notes Sarge's "own person
al scrapliook." Hie live songs were
recorded in Chicago 111 August
IW.), when Sarge ofK'iied up for the
last two shows of cmo-legends
Braid.
The live material has good sound
quality with minimal crowd noise,
and most of the songs are ofl of" Hie
Class Intact." Upbeat melodic num
bers such as "Stall" come off smooth

1\ and oflset thf more jXTSonal leel
ol slower songs such as an Klinore
solo version of "'Hie First Morning."
()ti the other hand, "Deai |osie,
Ix>ve Robyn," the only live song
from Sarge's first record, "Char
coal," is a last and furious punk tune
that acts as a three-minute confes
sioual, a kind of "Dear John" letter
in song form. On all of these songs,
the live energy of the hand shines
through, and the result is a little
more raw and less polished, al
though not any less successful than
their studio material.
1 he album also contains some
covers, including Cindi lumper's
" lime After lime" and Wham's
"Lrst Christinas," amusing songs
that serve more .is filler than any
thing else. Hie record's final two
songs, however, are a kind of solo Kl
more segue looking towards her
|H)st-Sarge musk career — slowed
down, semi-acoustic revisions of her
band-centered songwriting. lliey
are touching and quietly powerful,
acting as a reminder that although
the band may be over, its former
lead singer is by no means past her
prime. ('.heck out any of Sarge's al
bums, but es|)ecially "Distant," and
look for Klizalx/th Klmore 011 a solo
tour this fall.
