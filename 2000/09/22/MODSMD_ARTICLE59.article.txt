thrust ol the plot becomes clear

One ol the nice things about
McQuarrie's directorial debut is
his use ol the element ol surprise.
It is almost gi\ ing away too mut h
to say that the two incompetent
criminals kidnap the wrong
woman, especially if I add that
this woman is serving as a surro
gate mother. So let it suffice to say
that this movie, even though it is

named "W'a\ of the (.un" and
deals in violence, has .1 more in
teresting side.
Yes, there are gun lights (and
the\ are good!). Yes. main peo
ple die (and well!). But .YfcQuar
rie makes sure even one of his
characters had a depth not nor

Some ol the dialogue Ixuclers
on melodrama and does not meet
"Usual Suspects" standards, but
then again, neither does the acting.
While James (laan, as the pre
mier "bag man" for the big bad
(iuy, and Taye Diggs, as said bad
(iuy's bodyguard, turn in above
average performances, the rest of

the cast see in to play their parts
without passion.
Dylan Kussman, as the doctor
in the house, has the deer-stut k
in-headlights look down pat h\
the end of the movie. And Nick\
k.itt, as the other bodyguard,
adds nothing to the film oilier
than a warm hod\.
If vou like well-choreographed
gunpla) and deep characters,
you'll enjoy "The Wa\ ol the
(iun." Somehow movies depkiing
gun play are more popular with
men, hut I assure the women out
there that there is a bit more to
ibis movie than big guns. A bit
more.
