Let me refresh your memory,
because all of those games had
something in common. The) all
sucked. A lot.
In fact, it is rare in the video
game industrx to see a sua esslul
(omic-to-game translation, since
most game makers are more in
terested in obtaining merchan
dising rights to a name like Mat
vel (',omits than crafting some

tiling that is actually enjo\able or
playable lor more than ten min
utes.
With that in mind, Activision's
new Playstation game "Spider
man" truly and surpt isingl)
stands out from the < rap. As the
first Iree-roaming 3-1) action
adventure game with the Spider
man name attached to it. every
thing about the stylish produc
tion of this game screams class. It
has a well-crafted storyline,
smooth and comic-book-like ani
mation, brilliant sound ellects,
extras to unlock and a traditional
platform action game feel t li.it
can't be beat. In short, Activision
has succeeded where all other
gaming companies have tailed.
To be entirelv fair, Neversolt
Lntertainment deserves a lot ol
the credit as well. I he\ gained
much respect after their superb
development job on the best
seller "Tom Hawk's Pro Skater,"
and their programming work on
"Spidei man is just as successful.

using Tony Hawk s engine to
create beautilulh rendered New
York environments.
The real kicker, however, is the
fact that you control Spidey in
much the same way he would
move in "real life. Or, rather, as
the player, you can actuall) do
"whatever a spider can": web
slinging from building to building,
( limbing upside down on ceilings
and, of course, using your spider
sense to detect any danger.
Full 3-D mobility allows the
plaver to be stealthy or super
heroic, depending on the cir
cumstances. Ihe level designs,
six in all, are excellent in theii
utilization of Spiderman's special
skills. They also feature your typ
ical platform gaming experience:
pu//le solving, enemy destroying
and end-boss confronting. Fhe
levels are a little short, but the
game has four difficulty levels
which should up its repla\ value.
\dding to the game's authen
ticity is its narrator, Stan "the

man" Lee, co-creator of
Spiderman and all-around
comic book god. All oilier
voices in the game are
samples from the old car
toon series and work ex
tremely well. Even
Spidey's one-liners dur
ing battle leel true to the
comics.
Another nice addition

is the presence of in
gaine video cutscenes and lull
motion video sequences between
levels, which crafts a continuos
storyline thai gets the player
more involved in progressing
through the game. There are nu
merous comic-book characters
that players will recognize in this
game, and Marvel fans will have a
Held day when they see the inclu
sion of supervillians such as
Venom, Dr. Octopus and Car
nage, as well .is cameos by such
well-knowns .t> the Punishcr and
Daredevil.
What nun be most stunning

about these characters is that,
graphically, they look so much
like their comic book counter
parts. Ihe character animation
(not to mention the background
environments) are .ill textured
and shaded to near-perfection,
and ii 's easy to see that in the twi
light months of the Play Station's
life, programmers have lin.ilh
figured out how to 1u 11 \ utilize
the graphic potential of its out
dated :>2-bit technology.

"Spideiman," it ma\ be in its
