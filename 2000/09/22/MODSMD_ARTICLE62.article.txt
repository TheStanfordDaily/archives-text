As soon as your parents leave,
vour options for good food will
begin dwindling right through the
growing hole in your wallet.
Trust me, 1 know what your
wallet will look like — a hit like
mine. 11' only A I M receipts were
worth money, we'd he able to go
on some benders, huh?

Pasta ?

And (hen there's Palo Alto. Re
cently, small businesses and not
lor-profits have been leaving in
droves because ol the high rents.

Not exactly the best situation fora
restaurant to try and provide af
fordable sit-down dining.
So cheap pasta? In Palo Alto?
And not the "()live (larden" either?
Only at "Pasta ?," a University Av
enue eatery in its sophomore year.
Last year, the owners asked the
Palo Alto community to the name
the restaurant. During the trial pe
riod, they decided to go with an
unusual name that could inspire
some "Who's on First?" routines.
"Where do you want to eat
tonight?"
"Pasta ?"
"Yes, where though?"
"Pasta ?"
"Yes, I want pasta, but where do
you want to get pasta?"
"Pasta ?"
And so on. Customers, pre
dictably, preferred keeping the"?"
over any of the new names.

This is still Palo Alto, though, so
t he* average pasta entree hovers
around seven luieks a pop. Meat
dishes check in closer to ten dollars
a plate. But the Italian fare is well
prepared and, after .t few nights ol
Wilbur Dining, will definitely
make your mouth water.
The "Mai.lie Al Chianti," pork
medallions with fennel seeds in a
red wine same, was
subtle. The more 1 ate ol the red
fennel sauce, the more 1 liked the
dish. The seasoning of the meat
did not overpower the sauce, as
meat often does.
Vegetarian selections crowd the
menu. Mv meat-avoiding com
panion had a good eight or nine
dishes to choose from, and the
spaghetti pomodoro she chose
ended up being as stable .is the
tomato, garlk and basil sauce nor
mally is.

Another promising non-meat
dish was the "Penne Calabrese,"
which came with sundried toma
toes in a Romano cheese white
wine sauce.
The service was also right on.
Although our waiter's English was
a bit flawed, she came often to
check on us, especially considering
how busy "Pasta ?" can get.
She also had that knack for lim
ing that includes not bothering
slow eaters, while, at the same
time, not leaving empty salad
plates in front of customers fbi too
long.
One of the more ambiguous
traits of the restaurant is its ambi
ence. The tables stand only a foot
awav from each other in plat es, so
the noise level can rise exponen
tially.
Plunk bustling Italian bistro —
to the point that the bustle spills

over onto the University Avenue
sidewalk. T hat's great when yon
are eating with yonr friends, which
I wasn't.
Sitting inside, I was glad not to be
eating in oncoming loot trallic, but
the noise overwhelmed meat times.
The Italians next to us were
having a heated discussion that
probably shouldn't have involved
me. So I rose my voice. And then
they followed suit, raising their
pilch to an almost shout. And so
Oil.
