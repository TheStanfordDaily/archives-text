### JENN LINDSAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Although only tin- name of the
"Killing My Lobster" comedy
troupe came to its creators while
they were stone drunk, at a party,
many of the group's sketches ap
peal to have ri:;en Irom the bogs
ola similar stupor.

Killing My Lobster .TV, i,
Shelton Theater in SI
Oct. 6 through 29
$15 tickets

I lie evening's hilarious sketch
es range Irotn the anticsol a cross
dressing porn star whose favorite
words are "justice" and "lION
-1)1 RAS," who loves the sound ol
burritos and paper towels, and
who leads the cast of"( .eiutal 1 los
pital;" to a woman who pours
scalding hot collee down her pants
to cool oil on a I oast \ August

night; to a baby doll that yells,
"I ley. Mom, watch me die!" before
catapulting across the stage. The
Killing My lohster troupe is con
sistently strange and delightful.
The troupe was Iwun in 199b,
when co-founders Marc Vogl and
Paul (lharney saw a lousy sketch
comedy show. "We're better than
that slut, they concluded, and
immediately booked theater
space in San Franc isco.
They proceeded to assemble
various troupe members, all ol
them brown and Vassar gradu
ates, and, m I lie few years since,
the troupe has ascended to fill
spaces at the Seattle Fringe Festi
val and earned such accolades as
the San Franc isco bay Guardian's
"best (lomedy (iroup" award.
Such accolades are highly war
ranted, .is the show features
women selling "meat popsicies"
during an intermission sketch as
they mingle with audience mem
bers. Prospective customers can
choose the original meat popsicle

or the fruit-on-the-bottoin vari
ety.
"Don't touch me â€” I could Ik
your grandmother," one of them
snaps at an audience member. A
rival c ast member ac ross the room
starts calling out orders for hot
heel cups.
Later in the second half, a
poem about the exploits of |oni
Jaundice and Leper makes
a child in the front row cry. The
troupe, one could sa\, is painfully
successful.
In such irreverent sketch com
edy, it is often difficult to discern
whether c ast members are actual
ly talented actors or simply good
at making funny faces.
Abby Paige prevails as a superb
ac tress when, in a final sketch, she
faints in line at |amha Juice and
awakens in Bevernalioti, where a
life si/.e Orange-Berry Bliss pro
tects her in battle against the evil
Starbucks Iced l.atte.
Once the beverage has saved
her from catteinatecl doom, Abbv

expresses her desire to remain in
Bevernation with her Favorite
smoothie. "But I ('.AN' I l>e with
you," says Orange-Berry Bliss to
Ahhy. "I'm a fro/en berry bever
age. I would never know if you
wanted to Ik* with me or just drink
me."
Kven m an evening of such up
roar, there are some snags, most
ly resulting from overacting or
cast members forsaking their
cornedic talents lor a tendency to
be louder or more grotesque to
get laughs.
Moreover, the troupe Features
ten white 20-something kids
bouncing around on stage, which
creates an overwhelming combi
nation of juvenile spirit and white
collar narrowness.
A lew more years and colors
added to their repertoire will
round out a line evening of enter
tainment into a lethallv excellent
foray into the absurd.
