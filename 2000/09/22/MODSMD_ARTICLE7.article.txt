Stanford Bookstore
After the Follett I hgher F.ducation C irottpt(K>k over man
agement of the Stanford Bookstore in June, they upgraded
and improved the interior of the Bmkstore. 1 he remodel
ing ini I tides new (hairs and bmkshelves, an expanded cafe
and a rcorgani/ation ofthe lx>oks and supplies.
The course materials are still lo

replacing the Stanford Computer
Store.
I he main floor still houses books
and (IDs, and the greeting card sec -

The upper level is now home not
only to Stanford merchandise and
the (llinique counter, but also to the
Computer Store and the enlarged
cafe.
An enhanced sound system will
allow diflerent music to play on each
level.
"I think it's going to be a more re
laxing feel," said Jel Friedel, the
Bookstore's marketing manager.
"VVe c an accommodate more people
who want to hangout and study ...
. It's going to be a lot more space
fiiendly, a lot more user-friendly."
No major structural changes
were made, but the redesign allows
for added storage space within the
building.
Friedel described the Book
store's new interior as a combination
of old California style and Frank
Llovd Wright's architecture.

"It's going to enhance the build
ing and give it a warmer feeling,'
Friedel said.
Although Friedel said the reno
vation is not entirely complete, only
minor changes, such as trim and
lighting fixtures, remain to be fin
ished.
The Bookstore is open and
ready for the beginning-of-the
year rush with additional registers
to process the large numbers of stu
dents buying books and supplies.

sections of Campus Drive and
preparing to conned existing utili
