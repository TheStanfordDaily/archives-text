INTO DEBT.

Under the Army's Loan Repayment pro
gram, you could get out from under with a
three-year enlistment.
Each year you serve on active duty reduces
your indebtedness by one-third or $1,500,
whichever amount is greater, up to a $65,000 limit.
The offer applies to Perkins Loans, Stafford Loans,
and certain other federally insured loans, which are not
in default.
And debt relief is just one of the many benefits
you'll earn from the Army. Ask your Army Recruiter.
