with his former aide, who it was feared could rail)'
powerful allies in the military if prosecuted.
Fujimori said nothing about Montesinos' pre
dawn llight from the country, carried out in secret).

the armed lorces and praised the intelligence ser
vices and militat).

scandal that is culling short Fujimori's presidency,
arrived in Panama earlv Sunday, the Panamanian
government confirmed.

American leaders and the ()rgani/alion of American
States had asked Panama to reconsider .111 earlier
refusal to grant Montesinos asylum in order to
smoothe a wav out of Peru's political crisis.

nificant e thai Mr. Montesinos' leaving Peru would
have for facilitating the democratic process and
peace in that South American country," her ollice
said in a statement.

leaders that Montesinos — seen In main .is even
more powerful than Fujimori — be arrested and
pre jsecuted.

broke that he would call new elections and not stand
as a candidate. He also vowed to disband Mon

escape."

il it turned out the government allowed Montesinos
to depart despite Fujimori's pledges thai the ousted
spy chief would face a criminal investigation.

the removal of a potentials destabilizing element:
the spv c hief who had wielded control over ke\ fig
ures in the powerful armed lorces.

ing the political crisis." said Peru expert |ulio Car
rion at the University of Delaware.

been defused," Carrion said.

many have rankled at the country's reputation as .1
haven for disgraced Latin American officials, refused
