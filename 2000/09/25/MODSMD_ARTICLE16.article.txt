NKW YORK (AP) — It's a historic
development in the nation's most
watched Senate race: 1 lillary Rod
ham Clinton and her Republican
opponent, Rep. Rick La/io. have
banned soft-money ads fiom their
campaigns.
Oil Sunclav. as both sides jos
tled to take credit, watchdog
groups cheered — but also
expressed skepticism.
"We've never had two candi
dates agree not to spend money
that they could have had," said
Larry Makinson of the Center lor
Responsive Politics m Washing
ton. D.C. "I'm surprised. And like
the campaigns themselves, I'm a
little wary that it will stick."
The two campaigns reached a
deal late Saturday that prohibits
the political parties endorsing
them from airing I V and radio
ads boosting (heir candidates or
attacking their opponents. That
applies to the Republican and
Conservative parties on his side
and the Democratic, Liberal and
Working Families parties on hers.
Violations will be punished
reciprocallv: If one side buvs

S1 ()(),<)()() worth of air time, the
other side can do the same.
l lie agreement does not ban
direct mail or get-out-the-vote
eflbrts.
Matt Keller, deputy legislative
director of Common Cause, a
watchdog group in Washington,
said it would be the first major
campaign in which both leading
candidates signed such a pledge.
"'lTie Ix'st tiling alxmt it is that it
shows thev're dying to address soli
money; the worst thing is, we think
it's more politics than actual
relbrm," said Rachel Ixon, execu
tive director ol Common Cause-NY.
"If the candidates wanted to
show they're serious about iliis. they
would both pledge to pass a soli
money ban when they're elected."
La/io said Sunday on ABC's
"This week" that the voluntary
agreement between the two cam
paigns showed "we can lead with
out a law being in place."
Soft money refers to unlimited
funds collected bv political parties.
While hard money contributions,
limited to $2,000 per donor, can
be used for ads that advocate vot

ing for or against a candidate, solt
mono t an onh be used to advo
cate an issue, boost a candidate or
attack a candidate, rather than stat
ing, "Vote for so-and-so."
Should soli money be banned,
Lazio could have <111 advantage.
I lie latest federal filings showed
his campaign had more hard
tnone) than hers — $10.2 million
to $7.1 million.
Sen. John McCain, R-Ari/..,
who made campaign finance
reform his top issue in his bid for
the Republican presidential nom
ination, praised it as a "bold
agreement" on soft money.
"The New York race would
have been one of the most soft
nione\ controlled elections in the
history of Senate elections,"
McCain said, "but these two candi
dates have taken a risk ili.u can
only benefit the future of our
democracy."
Clinton's campaign first pro
posed a ban on soft-money spend
ing in December, before New
York Citv Mayor Rudolph Cin
liani dropped out of the race for
health reasons.
