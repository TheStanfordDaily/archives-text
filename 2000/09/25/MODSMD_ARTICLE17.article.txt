BET(iRADK, Yugoslavia (AP) — Slobodan Milose
vic was locked in a tight election rate that could
spell the end of his l'i years in power alter
Yugoslavs turned out in large numbers vesterday
in .1 ( haotic vote that poll watchers said was marked
b\ widespread irregularities.
Sensing a dramatic turn, .1 huge crowd of oppo
sition supporters streamed into the streets of down
town Belgrade late Sunday to await official results.
I le 1 meted riot polite earn ing shields and armed
with tear g.is launchers cordoned oil the group but
later withdrew after a concert by Milosevic's sup
porters ended.
Similar gatherings were reported in Nis, Novi
Sad, C'-at ak and several other towns in Yugoslavia's
main republic Serbia. There were no immediate
reports < >1 clashes.
No official results had been released hours after
polls c losed. 1 lowever, opposition leaders described
the first returns as encouraging. Milosevic's own
partv indicated he was leading with bareh enough
to avoid a runoff ()ct. S.
Milosevic 's Socialist Party c laimed he was leading
his chief rival, Vojislav Kostunica, l>v about 50 per
cent to ,'H percent based on returns from 299 of the
I(),()<>() polling stations. However, two rival opposi
tion parties disputed the figure, both giving a lead
to Kostunica.
Opposition leader /or,in Djindjic predicted
Milosevic would force a runoff in two weeks "bv fal
sifying the results, that will be his strategy." A
runoff must be held Oct. S il none of the five can
didates wins a majority.
Kostunica, supported by .111 alliance of IS par
ties, had been leading in opinion polls despite a
campaign marred bv .1 c rackdown against opposi
tion supporters, one-sided coverage by the staunch
ly pro-Milosevic media and the lack of broad-based
foreign monitoring.
During Sunday's voting, monitors reported that
some bo/es were smiled with pro-Milosvic ballots,
prominent opposition members were dropped
from registration rolls and voters were forced to
cast ballots public l\.
Nevertheless, Kosiunica's spokesman, Zoran
Sami, said the first preliminary results from opposi

lion poll watchers "are very encouraging." But he
gave no figures.
However, the ultranationalist Serbian Radical
Partv, Milosevic's partner in Serbia's government,
admitted its candidate lost the race. Ihe Radicals
said kostunica was leading by 46.2 percent to 42.7
percent lor Milosevic based on returns from about
one tenth of the polling stations.
The United States — which has invested mil
lions of dollars in an attempt to organize the tradi
tionally fractured Serbian opposition — has made
ousting Milosevic a major goal, believing there can
be no stability in the Balkans so long as he remains
in power.
The CKnter for Free Klections and Democracy,
a private group that monitored balloted, reported a
turnout of 74.0 percent in Yugoslavia's main repub
lic Serbia. In the smaller republic of Montenegro —
where the pro-Western government boycotted the
vote — the turnout was only about 24 percent.
"We believe that it's absolutely realistic to expect
an election victor) of our candidate already in the
first round." said opposition spokesman Cedomir
Jovanovic, basing their optimism on the initial
results and high turnout.
Milosevic made no statement alter polls c losed.
Karlier Sunday, he brushed aside accusations that
he would rig the vote to stav in power, predicting
prosperity after he wins and his troubled country is
"c leared up" politically.
The president's statement, made after he cast his
ballot in the Dedinje district where he lives, may
indicate he plans to crack clown hard on politic al
opponents — whom he has dubbed NAK ) lackeys
and traitors — if he's declared the winner.
Kostunica, a 56-year-old law professor, said after
voting that he expec ted to win.
The stakes were especiallv high in the voting,
which also included selection of a new parliament
and municipal governments.
If Milosevic loses, he risks extradition to the I.N.
war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands,
which indicted him last year for atrcxilies commit
ted by his troops in Kosovo. He may also risk mas
sive revenge by Yugoslavs tired of being an impov
erished pariah country after a dec ade of his rule.

A Kosovo Serb casts his vote in a convenience store-cum-polling station in the village of Kuzmin, Kosovo
today. The United States said it was concerned that Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, whose removal
has been a top U.S. foreign policy goal, might seek to steal Sunday's elections in Yugoslavia.
