ly behind last week's intervention.

the current economic expansion —
high oil prices — the International
Monetary Fund asked producers and
consumers to achieve stable prices at
reasonable levels.
The sinking euro and rising oil top
the agenda as the IMF and World bank
open their annual meetings here lues
day, and .ill eyes will be on financial
markets Monday to see if last week's
efforts to prop up the euro and push oil
lower will work.
A synchronized move Friday by the
United States, |apan, the European
(lentral Bank and other allies to buy the
euro on foreign exchange markets
immediately boosted the currency.

The euro surged from about 86 cents
to ( .)<) cents — but halved those gains by
the end of Friday's trading — after U.S.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers

strong dollar.
The statement cast doubt on U.S.
commitment to the intervention and per
haps future interventions, which essen
tially weaken the dollar to give a lx>osi to
the euro. The euro, the common c urren
cy used by 11 European Union nations,
has recently plunged to record lows.
Before markets open Monday, Euro
pean finance officials were busy putting
their own spin on Summers' comments,
saving the intervention had solid sup
port from all members of the so-called
Group of Seven industrialized coun
tries. including the United States.
Meanwhile, President Clinton said
Friday he would tap into the U.S. emer
gency oil stockpile to push prices lower.
IMF officials introduced a new plan

Sunday to stabilize the global oil mar
ket by bringing producers and con
sumers together, hailing it as a major
breakthrough in the current crisis,
which has seen oil prices surge to a 10-
year high above $!t0 per barrel, triple
the price of early 1999.
in the past, u has been difficult to get
producers and consumers to agree on
plans for the oil market, however, and
the latest effort was still short on details.

the final communique of the IMF's top
policy setting panel, the International
Monetarv and Financial Committee, and

bring oil producers and consumers
together," said Ciordon Brown,
