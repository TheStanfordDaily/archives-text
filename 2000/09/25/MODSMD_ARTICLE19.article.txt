I 'm a big believer in fundamentals. I wear
basic black, 1 sleep eight hours a night and
1 eat peanut butler and jelly. I've even been
known to brush my hair a hundred strokes
before bed.
I also read three newspapers ever)' morning.
And when I open up a newspaper, any news
paper, I want to see the fundamentals covered.
Reporting that is accurate, relevant and interest
ing, photographs that are clear and evocative,
opinions that are cogent and insightful.
Thai's our peanut butter and jelly.
Those standards are as important for 1 he
Daily as they are for national newspapers. Our
scope ma\ be smaller, but our objective is the

same.
We do a lot of things at 'The Daily: We report
on campus news, sports, science and entertain
ment. We take pictures, create graphics and pub
lish opinions.
I don't want to c hange what we do. I just want
to do it better.
The Daily receives regular complaints, and I
believe that two of them have particular merit.
1 he first is that we ignore or misrepresent some
of the- communities on campus. The second is
that our accuracy is not always up to par.
I he further we can go toward fixing those two
things, the sounder a paper we'll be.
We want to reach out for stories we used to

miss. We want lo avoid mistakes we used u> make.
We want lo better reflet I our community. We can
be brighter, quicker, dearer and smarter.
These are the fundamentals of publishing a
newspaper, and they are our goals.
I don't want to imply that you'll never disagree
with the Daily's coverage, or that we'll never
strew up. We are a stair composed ol students,
and learning on the job is how we operate.
But we will talk to the extra person, t.ike the
extra photograph, ( heck the copy one extra time
and make every eflbrt to make our work as thor
ough as possible.
If you do disagree with us. don't sit and fume.
Do something about it. Write a letter or a col

uinn, or, better yet, come work with us. Its pret
ty easy to make your mark on ibis paper; try us
and see.
I will not be satisfied until we produce a news
paper that embraces the fundamental goals of
journalism.
Otherwise, I might have trouble getting those
eight hours of sleep a night.
