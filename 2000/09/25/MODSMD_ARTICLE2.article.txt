# Renovated Toyon opens to residents
## New building features well-lit rooms, courtyard fountain

Toyon Hall s extensive Capital
Improvement Plan renovation
wrapped up just in lime lor a gala
re-opening Thursday. Over the
last month, construction crews
worked through the weekends
and into the nights to make sure
the dorm would he ready lor ar
riving students.
Director of Student Housing

Services Rodger Whitney called
the project a "photo finish."
"We're delighted because it's a
very last-track project," he said.
"It's truly a miracle."
The renovation not only
brought the prohibition-era
dorm, originally built in the
19205, up to code through seismic
upgrades but restored what Resi
dent Fellow Rolf Faste calls,
"Toyon's original grandeur."

century since the building's con
struction, a towering set of win

The renovated Toyon Hall courtyard includes a new fountain surrounded by
flowers. Toyon opened Thursday after several months of renovation and con
struction.
cross-shaped garden in the court
yard was replaced with a bare
slone walkway.
"We actually knew there had
been windows there," Faste said,
referring to the restored lobby.
They were always on the outside,
but from the inside they were just
stuccoed shut."
Faste is an architect and direc
tor of the University's program in
product design and began to help
plan the renovation four years
ago. He said the most common

complaints he heard from stu
dents were about the gloomy, dim
halls.
"It was like a dark and dingy
and medieval structure, you
know, 'Where's the dungeons?'
But now it feels like a palace,"
Faste said. "The students already
are just vibrating."
Several students at the open
house shared Faste's enthusiasm,
especially about the boost in nat
ural light.
"It's almost a little too bright,"
said sophomore Jim Fan. "But I
prefer this to the way it was last
year."
Also attracting praise was the
new fountain in the center of the
courtyard, nestled among red and

white perennial flowers. Around
the border of the yard, landscape
designers planted citrus trees to
complement Toyon's traditional
Spanish architecture.
"The planting scheme here is
really trying to evoke that historic
flavor," said landscape architect
John L. Wong, who helped super
vise the project.
Wong isn't worried about stu
dents "fountain hopping" in 'he
courtyard's centerpiece.
"It's a little too shallow," he
said.
Sophomore Jenny Miller
agreed. "It looks like it might tip
over if they tried, actually."
The Toyon renovation was one
of the most ambitious projects yet

undertaken in the ( IP, consum
ing roughh $13 million since it
began last spring break. Housing
and Dining originally planned to
complete the renovation entirely
over the summer, but realized last
year that extra time would lie
needed.
Whitney said the renovation
could not have been completed on
time without construction in the
spring.
"We barelv made this deadline,
and that's thanks to all the efforts
on the part of students and con
tractors throughout the spring to
make this happen," he said.
"Last night we still had a lot of
things to do," said Sandro
Vasquez, who helped oversee the

construction crew. "But we got
plenty of help, and we finished on
time."
Some repairs remain unfin
ished. Whitney added, but all of
the most important projects are
complete, including all of the
rooms.
"There's a few items in the base
ment that have to be finished,"
Whitnex said. "But that's typical of
all CIP projects. Fliey never are
what I'd call 100 percent absolute
ly polished. This one is probabh <i>
complete as am CMP project we've
had at this point in time."
CIP is a 15-year, $185 million
program to update housing across
campus through everything from
seismic restructuring and

rewiring for computers to repaint
ing and recarpeting. Mirrielees
and Branner Hall are set for reno
vation this year.
Whitney said the latter may be
even more challenging than
Toyon.
"Am time you're in an historical
building like Toyon, vou have a lot
more issues than vou do in a Stern
or <i Wilbur, which were built much
later and are not in as bad a shape as
Toyon had gotten," he said.
"Branner is very much like
Tovon. In fact n probably has even
more difficult issues to tackle than
Toyon in some ways."
Housing and Dining intends to
carry out the Branner renovation in
pieces over i he next three summers.
