Petitioners outline
proposal for Foothills
As representatives of the many hikers,
runners, equestrians and lovers of nature
who have signed our petition, we suggest
the following step he taken:
1. We request that Stanford rescind its
new regulations restricting public access to
the Stanford 112 fills (the Dish) as outlined in
its Conservation and Use Plan (issued
5/2/00).
2. We request th.it the public have access
to the Stanford Foothills through a net
work of unpaved trails and paths.
S. We suggest that Stanford: a) map the
area using CPS and CIS technology b)
make a fair and honest assessment of the
condition of the ecosystem, and c) host a
u .nl planning process in which the public,
independent resource management
experts and Stanford together create a
Master I rail Plan for the Stanford 1 fills,
giving strong consideration to establishing
regional trail connections.
I. We suggest that the University devel
op a pre-eminent multidisciplinary land
Management Program centered around
the restoration of the Stanford Hills for the
benefit of the public and wildlife together.
I hat the University conduct research on
this land in the emerging lield of ecological
restoration, becoming a leader in under
standing resource management.

We profoundly hope tli.it Stanford
recogni/e the enormous resource ii li.is in
11 us land: lor public benefit, fostering good
will through community involvement in
restoration; as a land base for research in
resource management; for te,unbuilding
within local companies through voluntary
work projects; as a resource of indescrib
ably beauty.

Professor supports University's
changes to Foothills
1 lie lulls are alive with the sound of
more birds than 1 can remember from the
past lew years. It is especialh c harming to
see them sitting on the new fence chirping
away.
Like many others, I was origin.illv wary
of the proposed changes .it the Dish, but
unlike many of them I am quite pleased
with what has been done. Instead of an old
cracked and uneven road we now have a
smooth one, and the new wood ranch-type
fence is much more attractive than the old
chain-link and barbed-wire fences.
As a cat person I am happy not to have
unleashed dogs running up to me, barking
and sometimes jumping on me. But espe

dally am I happ\ in guards on duly. They
have been extremeh cordial and friendly.
For ihe many women who walk alone in
ihe hills ihey add a modicum of security. 1
encourage Stanford to keep them on duty
after December and to hire another to be
stationed up .it the Dish.

Minority bone marrow donors scarce
As a Stanford Medical School Klood
Outer volunteer who attended the Sept.
1<) Yield 2 krist (Y2K) Gospel Festival at
the Fast side College Prep School in Fast
Palo Alio, I would like to applaud Gloria
Brown and other people from the African
American Cominunii\ Health Advisory
(Committee for the fine work they did orga
nizing the health component of the event.
I was particularly delighted that the
Blood Center's marrow donor coordi
nator had been invited to come and
answer questions about and recruit
minority donors for the National Mar
row Donor Program (NMDP) that facil
itates unrelated stem cell transplants for
patients with life-threatening blood dis
eases who are unable to find matching
donors within their families.
With minority donors outnumbered

about 4-to-l by Caucasians in the NMI)P
Registry, it's considerably harder for
minority patients with life-threatening ill
nesses like leukemia to find potential
donors.
Therefore, I would strongly encourage
minority Stanford students to sign up for
this life-saving program by calling the Mar
row Donor Coordinator at the Medical
School Klood Center.
