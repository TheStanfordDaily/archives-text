## Bruins blast punchless volleyball in straight sets 
### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
For ihc Stanford women's volleyball
team, ihe end of the Slimmer Olympics
can't get here soon enough. For UCLA and
the rest of the Pacific 10 Conference, heav
en would be a place where Logan Tom sta\ s
Down Under for the next lew years and
never comes back.
Tom, the spiking machine who current
ly stars for the U.S. Olympic volleyball
team, was sorely missed by her Stanford
teammates over the weekend as the Cardi
nal (7-4,2-2 Pac-10) fell t<> the No. 7 Bruins
(9-3, 4-0) in straight games Saturday night,
15-11,15-2,15-11.
"We don't have the big go-to player yet,"
said interim head coach Denise Corlett.
"About 00 percent of our offense is missing
from last year. We have a lot of people in
different roles, and we haven't been consis
tent for all three games yet.
Of small consolation to Corlett and the
2,432 on hand at Maples Pavilion was that
the team looked much better than the night
before, when the Cardinal posted a meager
.000 attack percentage.
What was apparent, however, was that
the team doesn't have a take-charge leader
like Tom or recently graduated kerri
Walsh, who is also on the Olympic team.
Where UCLA could depend on the amaz
ing kristee Porter, who had a whopping 2(i
kills from her rocket right arm, Stanford
seemed rudderless at times, a problem that

will be unified onh with more expci ience.
"There was much improvement from
[Friday] night," said Corlett. "We are a
team that is verv voung — we're learning
how to keep the ball in pla\ and reduce our
errors. Its ;t great group of players and
the\ II continue to improve."
The first game was ,i see-saw battle be
tween the two squads until I ( LA came up
with a big block b\ Ashle\ Bowles and Ilia
I larley with the Bruins up 9-8.
I CL\ tacked on three more points to
make it 12-8 when Stanford senior Jennifer
Detmer blocked a Bruin attack. Stanford
made it as dose as l'i-10, and held oil one
game point, but fell on a kill In Lauren
Fendrik.
Game two was nothing like game one.
The Bruins reeled oil 1 I points in a row be
fore sophomore outside hitter Ashlc\ Iv\
scored a point foi the Cardinal with a kill.
UCLA held Stanford to onh two points for
the game, the lowest score for the < Cardinal
since the NCAA championship match ver
sus Penn State List year. Stanford did man
age to stave off six game points before sur
rendering the final point.
Emboldened b\ the loud c rowel, the ( ar
clinal kept it lairlx close in the third and final
game, tving I ( I.A six times until the Bru
ins broke a 10-10 deadlock with three
points in a row. Stanford made it L>-l I. but
Bowles dosed it out for I CLAw ithhci six
teenth kill oldie match.

Lindsay Kawaga and Sara McGee attempt to thwart the onslaught of a UCLA hitter. The Stanford women struggled without the help of
Sophomore Logan Tom.

blocker Detmer, who notched .
team-high 12 kills 011 the night
Freshman outside hitter San
Dukes added nine kills while ju

uior outside hitler Michelle (!ham-
Ixi's tallied «i team-high 10 digs.
The last time Stanford
dropped back-to-back matches
was in 1 *)*)"> when the Cardinal
lost at Texas and to Texas A&M in
Chicago, while the last lime the
S(|uad lost two in a row at Maples
was in 1990, when Pacific and
