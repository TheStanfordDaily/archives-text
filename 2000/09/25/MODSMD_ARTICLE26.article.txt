# Australia upsets U.S. women's water polo to win gold medal
## Controversial, last-second penalty shot lifts Aussies to victory, overshadows sophomore Brenda Villa's game-tying goal 
### 
DMA, Australia (AP) â€” U.S. star Maureen ()'-
look's last lew moments in the water will remain
cloudy. Ht'i dreams ol gold, though, have passed
into history.
Australia's Yvette I liggins shot from outside the 7-
meter /one with 1.3 seconds to go, scoring the win
ning goal in a 4-3 victory over the United States and
winning the first-ever women's Olympic gold Satur
day night.
(-oat h (iuy Baker argued that tliggins had to pass
before her direct shot. But referees and FINA ofli

cials who were there disagreed, ending the Ameri
can's golden drive at the Sydney Games.
"I don't really want to get into the fact it was a bad
call," said OToole, who has won evervthing you can
in water polo except ()lympic gold.
After a cool-down period, Baker and his players
brushed off any controversy and were complimenta
ry of their winning hosts.
"It seems like a very anti-climactic way to
end,"U.S. captain Julie Swail said. "We fought hard
for the tie."
The Americans had tied things up on Stanford
sophomore Brenda Villa's goal with 2(> seconds left.
But a foul on Swail set up the craz\ final moments
that may never be topped as long .is the women's
game remains an ()lympic sport.
"I really didn't know what to do," said Higgins of
her game-winning shot. "1 saw everybody jumping in
the air, and I thought, 'We won, I'll jump in the air
too.' "

Baker jumped at the referees gesturing that the
goal should not have counted.
When asked what he said. Baker responded,
"Good game. 1 plan to keep coaching."
The crowd of near 17,000, the largest to attend a
women's game, at the Sydney International Aquatic
Center wanted to let loose. But held its breath until
the result was declared final.
Gianni Lonzi of FINA's water polo committee was
at poolside. He said through a spokesman that the
call stands.
"1 thought it was a fair game," Australian coach Ist
van Gorgenyi said.
It was a game of wild swings and emotional highs,
as organizers had hoped when they added women's
water polo after nearly 100 years as a men's onh
()lympic event.
Naomi Castle thrilled the crowd with 1:50 to go
with her shot from the left side that gave Australia a
3-2 lead.

But after Taryn Woods was whistled fora foul,
Villa scored with 20 seconds remaining to deadlock
things and perhaps set up the tournament's first-ever
overtime.
It wasn't to be. An apparent Australian goal was
disallowed because of a I .S. loul. I hen the Aussies
set it out for I liggins, who tilled it past goalie Bernice
()rwig with scant seconds left.
No one knew what to do. Fans were unsure
whether they should cheer. Baker was rushing up the
pool deck asking for c larification and extra time.
The oflicial notice set oil bedlam and brought a
close to the (Mympics' first women's event.
Farlier, Russia beat Netherlands 4-3 on another
late comeback to win the bronze.
I he I nited States had not won a water polo medal
since consecutive silvers in 1984and I OSS. Its women
had locked on to a gold run with ()' Foole, a 39-year
old who unretired when Olympic officials accepted
her sport.
