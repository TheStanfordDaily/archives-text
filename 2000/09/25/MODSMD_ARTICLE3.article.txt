# Athletics plans removal of golf course's 1st hole
## 
### JULIE HILL 
At a press conference held
Thursday, Ted Leland, director ol
athletics, unveiled a tentative plan
for the Stanford Golf Course, in
which the first hole would be en
tirely removed and relocated.
The plans for redevelopment
stem from a need for additional
faculty housing.
The plan for the golf course is
not yet finalized, Leland said, and
he promised that golfing commu
nity would be involved in the final
design.
According to the proposed
plan, the second and sixth holes
would be shifted to accommodate
the new first hole. With the excep
tion of holes eight and nine, the re
maining holes would also lie mod
ified. but would be situated in
roughly their current locations.
I he plan also provides housing
units for 3,000 graduate students
on the driving range and varsity
practice areas, Leland said. They
are on an even faster track than

the faculty housing, with a pro
posed starting date of 2003.
Hie Athletics Department is the
"father of the golf course," Leland
said. The Department pledges to
maintain the aesthetic beauty and
challenging reputation of the
course.
Leland said he thinks the pro
posed plan's success will be en
sured through collaboration with
the Stanford golfing community.
Much of the golfing communi
ty, including Tiger Woods and
Tom Watson, is strongly opposed
to the removal of the first hole and
the reconfiguration of the course.
"The choice isn't between
championship golf and housing,"
Leland said. 1 lowever, he asserted
that if the choice is between arc hi
tectural ambiance and housing,
housing will win.
Leland reiterated that the cur
rent first fairway is already not the
plan of George Thomas, the golt
course's designer.

Members of the Stanford community have been enjoying the Stanford Golf
Course since 1929. Under Stanford's proposed plan, the first hole, shown
above, will be moved to make room for new faculty housing.
Opponents maintain that less
controversial and more apt loca
tions lor housing have not been se
riously considered.
The golfing community
formed the Save Stanford C.olf
Course Committee under the
leadership of Richard Harris. I lie
group has identified several alter
natives for housing and parking
facilities within the previously de
veloped areas of campus. These
altei natives include the construc
tion of facultv housing in the
Searsville Block and on park
and-ride lots. These units would
have the same density as the de
veloped portions of current fac
ulty housing.
11 ie.se alternatives were submit
ted to Santa Clara County. Nu
merous letters from individuals
.ind <i petition from people
representing every cit\ in the
county were also sent.
Stanford has submitted a pro
posal to the (lounty fora (General
Use Permit. I.eland assured the

community that the County will
not make a definitive dec ision in its
()clober to the golf course plan. II
the County approves the plan, it
would simply "narrow opt ions and
define new constraints," he said.
1 he opponents are wary of
what they see as another empty
promise. In March at the I niver
sityColl (lourse Advisory meeting,
attendees were told that the course
was not in jeopardy. But an Envi
ronmental Impact Report re
leased in June examined the eflect
ol building on goll course land.
At the press conference, Leland
apologized for the miscommuni
cationand misunderstandingol is
sues regarding the Stanford Coll
(lourse.
I he golf course preservation
committee proposed 3,063 new
graduate student multi-level
housing units and several multi
level parking structures in plat e
of the current surface-level park
ing areas. II the driving range
must be moved, they proposed
that it be located where the Envi
ronmental Health Facility cur
rently stands, and the health fa
< ilit\ would be relocated to a re
mote area of c ampus.

Housing has been increasing!
in demand since the Peninsula
real estate market lias skyrcxke
ed. Stanlbrd's building is limite
by the Ceneral Use Plan it sigr
each decade with Santa Clar
(Country.
The CI P is currently up for rc
view, and if Stanford's plan passe
the area around the I diversity wi
undergo massive developmei
over the next ten years.
Land use designations will b
open lor changes in 2025. Ili
second fairway is "sale" throug
2020, Leland said.
IIi lie golfcourse is reconstruc
ed, sequential construction woul
allow ii to remain open.
According to the plan, otlu
changes will be made to make wa
for ;i wider Sand Hill Road. 11l
clubhouse will be enlarged an
renovated lor storage ol tlie ele<
trie-powered carts that will replac
the gas-powered carts in 2003.
Leland said discussions abot
building on the golf course bega
in 1003 with a private study ol tit
feasibility of retaining the aesthetic
qualities of the golf course. T his
study culminated in the current
plan lor the course.
