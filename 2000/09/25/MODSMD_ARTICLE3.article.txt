# Athletics plans removal of golf course's 1st hole
## 
### JULIE HILL 
At a press conference held
Thursday, Ted Leland, director ol
athletics, unveiled a tentative plan
for the Stanford Golf Course, in
which the first hole would be en
tirely removed and relocated.
The plans for redevelopment
stem from a need for additional
faculty housing.
The plan for the golf course is
not yet finalized, Leland said, and
he promised that golfing commu
nity would be involved in the final
design.
According to the proposed
plan, the second and sixth holes
would be shifted to accommodate
the new first hole. With the excep
tion of holes eight and nine, the re
maining holes would also lie mod
ified. but would be situated in
roughly their current locations.
I he plan also provides housing
units for 3,000 graduate students
on the driving range and varsity
practice areas, Leland said. They
are on an even faster track than

the faculty housing, with a pro
posed starting date of 2003.
Hie Athletics Department is the
"father of the golf course," Leland
said. The Department pledges to
maintain the aesthetic beauty and
challenging reputation of the
course.
Leland said he thinks the pro
posed plan's success will be en
sured through collaboration with
the Stanford golfing community.
Much of the golfing communi
ty, including Tiger Woods and
Tom Watson, is strongly opposed
to the removal of the first hole and
the reconfiguration of the course.
"The choice isn't between
championship golf and housing,"
Leland said. 1 lowever, he asserted
that if the choice is between arc hi
tectural ambiance and housing,
housing will win.
Leland reiterated that the cur
rent first fairway is already not the
plan of George Thomas, the golt
course's designer.
