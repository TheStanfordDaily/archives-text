Frisbee players across campus are asking,
"What happened i<> Roble Field?"
I he popular field, primarily used lor pickup
soccer and fool ball games as well as organized
ultimate Frisbee practices, is in the process of a
thorough renovation, which began at the end
of August.
"Roble Field got a lot of use through [recre
ation] programs and daily use, and it really
needed to be renovated," said David Schinski,
director of athletic facilities.
The field has been upgraded only a few

times since it was originally planted in the early
19305. One ol the first major renovations oc
curred in the late H)f)os, when the school re
placed the field's irrigation system. Since then,
many other University construction projects
have made the field uneven, according to a
press release distributed by the athletic depart
ment.
The current project will completely revamp
Roble Field. The renovation includes a new ir
rigation system, soil amendments, which lest
the soil to see il ii has the proper mix of ingre
dients, and new seeded sports turl.
The old turf has been stripped, leaving be
hind only dirt, and the entire area is in the

process of being leveled. The field should he
planted by Oct. 15.
While the bright red signs posted on the
metal fences surrounding Ruble Field, located
across the street from Lagunita Court, say that
ii won't be open until April 2001, officials say it
may open sooner.
"If we have a good grow period during the
winter season, the field could be open as soon as
February or March," Schinski said.
Schinski stated that the majority of orga
nized recreation programs that were held on
Roble Field in the past will be moved to the
