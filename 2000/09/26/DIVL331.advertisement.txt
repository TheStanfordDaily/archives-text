teacher or, perhaps, as a teacher. In recognition of the Oral Communication Program at
CTL, we are asking you to submit your recollections in the form of a five-minute speech,

gathering of faculty and students in November. The two winners will each receive a prize

speech to the Center for Teaching and Learning, 4th Floor, Sweet Hall, by 3:00 pm on
Oct. 25, or through e-mail to: cjosborne@stanford.edu. A committee will review the con
tent of all submissions, and will select several finalists. Finalists will then be asked to
deliver their speeches to the committee, which will select one undergraduate and one
graduate contest winner. The two winners will present their talks at CTLs 25th
Anniversary celebration in November.
Guidelines:
• Your speech should take no more than five minutes to deliver.
• Your speech should address, from some perspective, the central role
a teacher or your own teaching has played in your life.
Our selection committee will be seeking thoughtful, original, and provocative
reflections on teaching: May the best tale win!
