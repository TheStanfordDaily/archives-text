You're driving around town, fa
miliarizing yourself with the place,
gearing up for an evening at the
Grand Ole Opry because, as everyone
knows, country music is all there is to
Nashville.
Before crossing the Cumberland
River and heading toward Music
Row and the Ernest Tubb Record
Shop, you swing by Vanderbilt Uni
versity, a red-brick wonder that's
beautiful and inspiring at the same
time, reminiscent of the Stanford
campus in California.
.. . It's quite a surprise.
And so is Nashville itself a
sparkling, pleasant city that could
use as its official motto the phrase
'We're Not Just Country Music Any
more.' Not that musicians from
Loretta Lynn to Shania Twain aren't
still huge attractions.
