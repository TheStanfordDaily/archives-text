## Yugoslav coalition may splinter after victory 
### 
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) —
I lie opposition coalition that is
claiming victory over President
Slobodan Milosevic is an unlikely
alliance that includes nationalists,
ethnic minorities, labor unions
and center-right technocrats.
1 hey came together fora com
mon goal — driving Milosevic
from power. It they succeed, it
remains to be seen how long the
coalition can hold together in the
face of monumental problems fac
ing this country after a decade of
civil strife and ec onomic collapse.
The 18 members of the Demo
cratic Opposition of .Serbia
include some large, nationwide
parties with branches in nearly
every corner of the country. Oth
ers are small, almost shoestring
operations with a single office and
little more than a party banner, a
fax machine and lots of resolve to
bring about cha'nge.
National parties form the heart
of the alliance, Fliey include the
center-right Democratic Party,
and the moderately nationalist
Democratic Party of Serbia whose
leader Vojislav Kostunica chal

lenged Milosevic in the Sunday
elections.
Other parties include the
Movement for Democratic Serbia
and the Democratic Alternative —
both headed by defectors from
Milosevic, including he former
Army chief. Gen. Momcilo Perisic.
Two parties represent the
country's Muslim and ethnic
Hungarians communities. Anoth
er — New Democracy — attracts
members from the business com
munity and technocrats.
The Democratic Opposition of
Serbia has also forged alliances
with independent labor unions
and the popular, anti-Milosevic
student organization Otpor, or
Resistance.
The disparate nature has
raised concern that the alliance
may not hold together if it does
gain power. That doesn't appear
to bother Kostunica.
"We have pledged to remove
the biggest obstacle for democracy
in Serbia — Milosevic," he saicl.
"Only then we will really be able
to freely communicate with peo
ple without any obstacle."

For years, ..the opposition
movement in Serbia, the larger ol
the two Yugoslav republics, had
been plagued bv personal rival
ries <ind philosophical differ
ences, which Milosevic exploited
to cripple any serious challenge
to his rule.
But last year's 78-dav NATO
bombing campaign against
Yugoslavia changed all that. With
the country in ruin and NATO
led peacekeepers in control ol
Kosovo province, the opposition
decided it was time to move.
With strong encouragement
from the United States and West
ern European countries, opposi
tion leaders began a series of
meetings last year which led to the
alliance. When Milosevic called
early elections in |ulv. the opposi
tion was ready.
The next step was to find a c an
didate to oppose Milosevic.
Some of the best known fig
ures, including former Belgrade
mayor Zoran Djindjic, were ruled
out because long years in politics
had left them with enemies.
Djindjic, an urbane, multilin

glial figure, played poorh among
rural voters because of his "cil\
slicker" image.
Killer kostunica, a dour law
professor, lie was selected as the
standard-bearer because public

opinion polls showed he had
levver negatives than the others.
Opposition strategists decided
iliev could build a favorable image
lor liim among the public.
A nod to their success came

Mondav from Vuk Draskovic, the
leader of Yugoslavia's largest
opposition party — a longtime
maverick who frustrated other
anti-Milosevic forces with lii>
refusal to unite with them.
