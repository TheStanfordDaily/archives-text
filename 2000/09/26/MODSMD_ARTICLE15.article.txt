CHEJU, South Kor&a (AP) — In their first ever
meeting, the defense chiefs of South and North
Korea pledged Monday to work lot reconciliation
across the ( '.old War's last frontier.
South Korean Defense Ministei Clio Sung-tae
and Kim II Clutl, minister of the People's Army of
North Korea, agreed to open working-level mili
tary talks to discuss clearing mines to reconnect a
rail line between the two Koreas, South Korean
officials said.
The meeting between Clio and Kim on this
resort island was one of the most significant steps
toward rapprochement on the divided peninsula
since a June summit of the leaders of both Koreas.
It was the first meeting between the heads of
the two militaries, which stand guard at the last
flash point of the Cold War. The border is guard
ed by nearly 2 million troops on both sides, barbed
wire, minefields, and artillery and missiles that t an
reach each other's capitals.
In their 90-minute talk. Cho and Kim "shared
a basic understanding" that their militaries should
support the agreements of the summit at which
the two Koreas agreed to seek eventual reunifica
tion, said Brig. Gen. Yoon 11-young, spokesman
for Seoul's Defense Ministry.
"During their keynote speeches, the two minis
ters said South and North Korea should end the
mistrust and confrontation of the past and move
toward an arena of mutual trust and reconcilia
tion," Yoon said.
Following their June summit, the two Koreas
agreed to reconnect a cross-border railway line
severed shortly before the 1950-53 Korean War
and build a highway linking the countries.
Up to 1 ()().()()() mines planted in the area of the
rail corridor will have to be removed. C )n Mondav,

the defense ministers agreed to coordinate the
mine-clearing project between the two armies
operating in the Demilitarized /one, ot DM/, sep
arating the two Koreas.
South Korea had also planned to propose
establishing a military hot line.
It also planned to propose that the two Koreas
notify each other of large troop movements and
that they send observers to each other's major mil
itary exercises.
South Korean officials, doubted whether
sweeping measures that will ease tension across
the peninsula can be achieved in this lirst meeting.
The fact that the two defense chiefs were dis
cussing cooperation, however, was seen as a great
stride toward peace on the peninsula.
The Pentagon still regards the North's 1.1 mil
lion-member military which is believed to have
chemical and biological weapons and is develop
ing long-range missiles as one of the greatest secu
rity threats in northeast Asia. Washington keeps
37,000 U.S. soldiers in South Korea as .i deterrent
against the North.
Alter Monday's talk at a five-star hotel, Kim and
his four Northern deputies switched from their
braided olive green uniform to suits and toured
the resort island, dominated bv a volcanic cone at
the center surrounded bv genth tolling hills cov
ered with tangerine groves.
Also Monday, delegations from both Koreas
met in Seoul to discuss increasing badh needed
investment in the impoverished, communist
North, which depends on outside handouts to
avert mass famine among its 22 million people.
The Korean Peninsula was divided into North
Korea and the pro-Western South at the end of
World War 11.
