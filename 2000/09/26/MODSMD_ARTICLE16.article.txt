JKRI SALIM (AIM — Hie Israeli and Palestinian
leaders met in Israel on Monday, under U.S. pres
sure to come up with a permanent deal, but with lit
tle to show after two months of massaging the deal
breaker — Jerusalem.
Prime Minister I.hud Barak and Yasser Aralat
met lor three horn s late List night at Barak's home in
the town of koc:ha\ Yair in central Israel, Barak
spokesman Gadi Baltianskx s.iid in a statement.
lie s.iid the meeting, which ended just alter mid
night, was conducted "in a very good atmosphere
,md a positive spirit" and described it as an "evalua
tion and .111 exchange of views." lie said the leaders
did not negotiate "specific" issues.
I hat suggested that the\ avoided discussion ol
Jerusalem, the issue that broke up the I .S.-spon
sored ( amp David talks in Jul). Aside from an
exc hanged greeting or two <u the I .\. Millennium
summit earlier this month, the two have not met
since then.
Negotiating teams from both sides were to leave
for Washington within hours of the meeting's end
lor separate talks with the Americans.
All lour negotiators headed lor Washington —
Mohammed Dahlan and Saeb Krekat lor the Pales
tinians, <uid Acting Foreign Minister Shlomo lien-
Ami and Gilead Slier lor the Israelis — were at the
meeting, along wftli other senior officials. Baltiansky
said President ('.linton (ailed during the meeting and
spoke with Barak and Aralat.
"Both leaders told the I .S. president that they are
determined to make evei \ elfort and lake advantage
of even opportunity to reach agreement," Baltian
sky said in a statement.

Dahlan, who said the Americans had proposed
the new round <>l meetings, expressed the hope that
the I .S. ideas would be more developed than those
the Palestinians were asked to consider two months
ago. "At Clamp David, they proposed an initiative
that was not deeply studied, and because of that, they
failed."
In fact, negotiators on both sides said new ground
was broken at ( amp David on issues previously
thought unbridgeable: Palestinian refugees, Jewish
settlements and Jerusalem.
I lie negotiators are under growing time pres
sure. Barak laces an increasingly hostile parliament
that lias threatened to topple him over his peace
policies when it reconvenes in late October, and the
Clinton administration wants a deal before the pres
ident's term ends.
1 lie core of the Jerusalem issue is control over a
crucial hoh site, the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the
third-holiest site in Islam built atop the ruins of the
ancient Jewish temples.
In the two months since Camp David, each side
lias moved forward on the issue — but bat eh . Israel
has apparentK given up its insistence 011 sovereign
t\ over the site and savs it is willing to consider a
I .S. proposal that would transfer control to the live
permanent members of the U.N. security council —
the I nited States, Russia, China, Britain and
France.
I lie Palestinians have also inched away from their
own demand for full control, saving the site could
ultimatelv be controlled In a committee of Islamic
countries led bv Morocco, a nation known for its
friendliness to Israel.
