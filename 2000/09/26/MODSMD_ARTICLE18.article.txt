						Stanford Daily University's refusal to ban Napster shows strength

Published Since 1S<)1

Despite a recent plea from I)r. Die's
and Metallica's lawyers, Stanford has
chosen to continue to allow students
to access Napster. Its decision to
stand its ground preserves part of the Silicon
Valley entrepreneurial spirit that the Universi
t\ has helped to create. 1 he University's choice
also shows deference and respect for the law.
I lie I diversity could have easily followed
other schools, including Yale, Mi land the
I niversitx of Southern California and banned
access to the popular music-swapping pro
grain, hut Stanford firmly refuted the argu
ments ol the letter.
I he lawvers' incredulous claims included
the idea that access to Napster defiled the
school's commitment to creative arts and that

Stanford had a moral, ethical and legal obliga
tion to stop students from using the program.
The University unequivocally rejected these
arguments, wisely citing the letter's lack ol
legal authority and factual basis.
I lie decision to ban Napster before the pro
gram and its creator had their day in court
would have been judgmental and presumptu
ous. The University cannot be expected to
condemn the program and the spii it ol its cre
ation before a legal decision is made.
A letter demanding such strong voluntary
restrictions is an affront to an institution that
has been a pioneer in today's computer age.
Stanford's decision not to be bullied into ban
ning access to Napster, despite possible legal
ramifications, shows the I niversitx's commit

meni to entrepreneurs.
As the birthplace of many startups, Stan
ford would be guilty of the most blatant
hypocrisy if it tried to ban a program whose
creator is only guilty of being innovative.
Napster and other similar programs are
best used to stimulate rigid industries. In this
fast-paced technological world, older estab
lishments must evolve and change with the
technology. 1 lere, the record industry will be
forced to accept MP.-is and file sharing and
investigate how to capitalize on the new tech
nology instead of focusing on banning it.
Ihe claims being made against Napster
have been made against other technological
advancements, such as V( '.Rs. The movie-mak
ing industry went so far as to take the case to

the Supreme Court citing copyright violations.
What if the University had banned VCRs?
How much productivity, educational value
and other technological advancement would
have been lost?
The case against VCRs, however absurd
in terms of today's perspective, shares a
great deal with the current claim against
Napster.
The University's decision sends a clear
message to students. Once again, we are
given the freedom to make our own deci
sions, to choose right from wrong. It also
upholds the true tradition of Stanford to
encourage all of its students to continue to
develop ideas and products that will be safe
from prohibition.
