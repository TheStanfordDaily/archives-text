# Effects of new alcohol policy to vary by student residence
## 
### JULIANA LIU EDITORIAL STAFF 
I louse meetings this week will likeh ( en
ter around the University's new policy pro
hibiting the use of dorm funds to put chase
alcohol. Vice Provost for Student Allans
James Montoya announced the policy last
week.
"It's important to know that funds col
lected by the University, the charges put on
students' official bills, are not being used lor
purchase of alcohol for underage drink
ing,'' Montoya said l.tst Tuesday.
In previous years, this rule applied only
to all-freshman dormitories. Four-class and
upper-class houses could choose to use
house money to buy alcoholic drinks.
Montoya said the alcohol polio was
changed to bring the University more in
line with 1998 federal legislation c alling for
schools to play a greater role in controlling
undergraduate drinking. (Compliance with

these laws, in part, determines how much li
nancial aid Stanford receives Irom the gov
ernment, Montova said.
I he new rule will mean different things
lor each type of residence.
The polic\ has the greatest impact on
upper-class and four-class houses and those
dorms thai collect their social fees through
the I niversity, Montoya said.
"In years past, [the alcohol decision] was
done bv dorm consensus. It was put to a
vote," said Anthony (Jutierrez, a senior and
resident assistant in Arroyo.
Now such dorms, whose funds include
the dues of students over 21, will not have
the option of choosing to spend house
funds on alcoholic beverages.
"Right now, [the new policy] is not af
fecting us."said junior Tress (>cxxlwin, an
RAin all-freshman Rinconada.
"But 1 think it's going to put a damper
on events next year [when I'm no longer in
an all-freshman dorm]."

()ther RAs expressed similar concerns.
Senior W alter Shell, an RAin Kimball
Hall, an upper-class dormitory, said lie
hopes the rule will not drive students to
drink behind closed doors.
Yost RA Ksther Bvun, a senior, was con
cerned that residents will turn to olf-cam
pus parties. B\ un also thought that some se
niors, who are over 21, would be frustrated
that ihe\ no longer have the light to spend
their dorm hinds io bu\ alcohol.
Armin Rosentran/, a resident fellow in
Yost. said that instead of using dorm funds
i< > buv alcx)h<>l, the upper-class residents will
"pass the li.n" to collect money lor parties
on their own. Part) organi/ers will attend
workshops to ensure die responsible and
sale management of residence parties.
" I lie funding will change, but there is no
ban on alcohol in upper-class residences,"
Rosentran/ said.

I louse meetings this week will likeh ( en
ter around the University's new policy pro
hibiting the use of dorm funds to put chase
alcohol. Vice Provost for Student Allans
James Montoya announced the policy last
week.
"It's important to know that funds col
lected by the University, the charges put on
students' official bills, are not being used lor
purchase of alcohol for underage drink
ing,'' Montoya said l.tst Tuesday.
In previous years, this rule applied only
to all-freshman dormitories. Four-class and
upper-class houses could choose to use
house money to buy alcoholic drinks.
Montoya said the alcohol polio was
changed to bring the University more in
line with 1998 federal legislation c alling for
schools to play a greater role in controlling
undergraduate drinking. (Compliance with

these laws, in part, determines how much li
nancial aid Stanford receives Irom the gov
ernment, Montova said.
I he new rule will mean different things
lor each type of residence.
The polic\ has the greatest impact on
upper-class and four-class houses and those
dorms thai collect their social fees through
the I niversity, Montoya said.
"In years past, [the alcohol decision] was
done bv dorm consensus. It was put to a
vote," said Anthony (Jutierrez, a senior and
resident assistant in Arroyo.
Now such dorms, whose funds include
the dues of students over 21, will not have
the option of choosing to spend house
funds on alcoholic beverages.
"Right now, [the new policy] is not af
fecting us."said junior Tress (>cxxlwin, an
RAin all-freshman Rinconada.
"But 1 think it's going to put a damper
on events next year [when I'm no longer in
an all-freshman dorm]."

()ther RAs expressed similar concerns.
Senior W alter Shell, an RAin Kimball
Hall, an upper-class dormitory, said lie
hopes the rule will not drive students to
drink behind closed doors.
Yost RA Ksther Bvun, a senior, was con
cerned that residents will turn to olf-cam
pus parties. B\ un also thought that some se
niors, who are over 21, would be frustrated
that ihe\ no longer have the light to spend
their dorm hinds io bu\ alcohol.
Armin Rosentran/, a resident fellow in
Yost. said that instead of using dorm funds
i< > buv alcx)h<>l, the upper-class residents will
"pass the li.n" to collect money lor parties
on their own. Part) organi/ers will attend
workshops to ensure die responsible and
sale management of residence parties.
" I lie funding will change, but there is no
ban on alcohol in upper-class residences,"
Rosentran/ said.
