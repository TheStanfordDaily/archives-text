the Aven Aquatic ( enter.
Sophomore Peter I ludnut led the Stan
lord scoring surge on Sunday, talking a
career-high four goals. Complimenting
Hudnut was junior lodd Snider: who
added three goals of his own. I he remain
der <>l the scoring was spread through">ui
the Stanford roster with seven players

recording goals in the contest.
"We have good balanced scoring," said
head coach Dante Dettamanti. According
to Dettamanti, the team has scored over
ten goals in a match onlv once earlier this
season, in a 12-f) romp over UC-Davis.
Dettamanti considers the Aggies a much
weaker team than the Cauchos, who had
recent lv notched a surprise win over No. 7
Pacific.
Disappointed l>\ Saturday's loss, the
Cardinal came out seething, iluduut
notched two goals in the lirst period as
St an lord rose to an earh 1-0 lead. Bv half
time 1 ludnut had gotten another goal and
Stanford was ahead with a more-than
coinloi table 7-1 lead.
Saturday's match was a bit of a dillerent
storv lor the Cardinal. Although ii heat
C.al 7-5 in the semifinals of the Southern
California Tournament a week ago, the
Bears seemed to have some relined
weapons in the pool this time around.
"We did not pla\ as well [Saturday].
I)ettainanti said. "We had trouble scoring.
()ur power plav was not working well. We

only stored on the power plav once out ol
lour opportunities."
In their first conference game, the Stan
ford men were quit kl\ put down !i-l in the
lirst period when the Beat s' Kid.id Ha/or,
Jerry Smith and Joe Kaiser each scored
earh goals. B\ halliinie both Smith and
lla/or had scored another, and Adam
Met/ger pounded one in to increase the
Bear's lead u> f>-2.

In the second half Stanford seemed to
find a bit more ammunition. I he (Cardinal
closed the gap to within two on goals In
I ludnut and junior Mark Anion to put the
s< ore <n (i-4 with 1 minute, 34 seconds left
in the third period.
Bui a third goal In I la/or in the fourth
quarter gave ( al the edge it needed for the
\ icton.
'We're preth close to C.al," Dettamanti

said. " Kit her team is capable of winning —
but not by three goals."
Perhaps even more impressive than the
Bear's oflense was their plav at the defen
sive end. (ial goalie Russell Bernstein put
up impressive numbers and had 1 1 saves
on the afternoon.
