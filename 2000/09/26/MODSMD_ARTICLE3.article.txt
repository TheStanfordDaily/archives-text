# Management Science Dept. takes off
## Students, profs enthusiastic about new major; department 
### MICHAEL R. FAINELLI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This fall, when Industrial Engineering majors
choose their courses, they'll have to turn to a new
section in the Stanford Bulletin: Management
Science and Engineering.
The department was horn last winter of the
merger between the Department of Industrial
Engineering and Engineering Management and
the Department of Engineering-Economic Sys
tems and ()pcrations Reseat( h.
Students chipping away at Industrial Engi

neering requirements need not worry, accord
ing to Department Chair and Management
Science Prof. Elisabeth Pate-Cornell, because
they are free to pursue either the old or the
new track.
"We have grandfathered everyone precisely
to make sure the students have no difficulties,"
Pate-Cornell said.
So far, things are going smoothly for
students.
"| I he merger] hasn't really directly affected
me, because I'm going to stav with the IE track,"
said Elita Cheung, a junior who declared Indus
trial Engineering under the old system.
Meanwhile, the Management Science and
Engineering's student sen ices ollice has started
ironing out the wrinkles that form when two de
partments become one.

Courses have not been renamed, but nearly
all have been renumbered. New department re
quirements had to be counted out to the last unit.
Any last-minute changes will have to be posted in
the online bulletin.
Master s students are allowed to pursue a con
centration of courses in another engineering de
partment, but the s< heme of courses which satis
fy that concentration have yet to be hammered
out.
file building blocks ol the MSK major closely
resemble those of Industrial Kngineering. Stu
dents must tackle requirements in math, science,
engineering fundamentals and fechnology in
Society.
Students who have already declared will delve

into a 50-unit chunk of core classes,
ranging from Quality Control to
Industrial Accounting.
New MSE majors will take a
much smaller core and then choose
between three concentrations: In
dustrial Engineering / ()perations
Management, Operations Re
search and Technology and Policy.
The merger proposes to do
much more than trim excess words
oil the unwieldy tides of the two
parent departments.

Under the old system, Indus
trial Engineering students took
courses in EES( )R and professors
of i he one department were
doing research that spilled over
into the other.
Uniting the two departments,
Pate-Cornell explained, will "cre
ate a create a critical mass in the
field of management science and
engineering."
Not all the professors were en
amored with the idea of a depart
mental marriage at first, hut Pate-
Cornell said that most of the resis
tance boiled down to an aversion
to change.
I he Department of EESOR
was the product of a merger he

tween Engineering-Economic Sys
tems and Operations Research.
Some professors in EESOR were
reluctant to plunge into the ad
ministrative hog of a merger lor a
second time.
But when President John Hen
nessy, then Dean of the School of
Engineering, presented opponents
with the choice of leaving the de
partment or staying aboard lot the
merger, they stayed aboard, I'ate-
Cornell said.
Management Science Prof.
Ronald Howard, along with other
professors who forged the deal,
said he is optimistic that the new
department is poised to become
one of the front runners in its field.
