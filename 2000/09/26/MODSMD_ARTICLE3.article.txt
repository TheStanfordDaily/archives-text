# Management Science Dept. takes off
## Students, profs enthusiastic about new major; department

This fall, when Industrial Engineering majors
choose their courses, they'll have to turn to a new
section in the Stanford Bulletin: Management
Science and Engineering.
The department was horn last winter of the
merger between the Department of Industrial
Engineering and Engineering Management and
the Department of Engineering-Economic Sys

Students chipping away at Industrial Engi

neering requirements need not worry, accord
ing to Department Chair and Management
Science Prof. Elisabeth Pate-Cornell, because
they are free to pursue either the old or the
new track.
"We have grandfathered everyone precisely
to make sure the students have no difficulties,"
Pate-Cornell said.
So far, things are going smoothly for
students.
"| I he merger] hasn't really directly affected
me, because I'm going to stav with the IE track,"
said Elita Cheung, a junior who declared Indus
trial Engineering under the old system.
Meanwhile, the Management Science and
Engineering's student sen ices ollice has started
ironing out the wrinkles that form when two de
partments become one.

Courses have not been renamed, but nearly
all have been renumbered. New department re
quirements had to be counted out to the last unit.
Any last-minute changes will have to be posted in
the online bulletin.
Master s students are allowed to pursue a con
centration of courses in another engineering de
partment, but the s< heme of courses which satis
fy that concentration have yet to be hammered
out.
file building blocks ol the MSK major closely
resemble those of Industrial Kngineering. Stu
dents must tackle requirements in math, science,
engineering fundamentals and fechnology in
Society.
Students who have already declared will delve
