What do a newly c reated center
lor the study ofyouth, genetics re
search and air traflic control have
in common? The answer is two
separate recently awarded $5-mil
lion grants, for revolutionary re
search into youth communities
and cellular interactions.
John Gardner, Glass ol '33,
founded the John Gardner Gen
ter for Youth and Their Gommu
nities with a $500,000 grant from
the William and Flora Hewlett
Foundation in July. The ("enter
received a $5 million grant on Fri
day from the Fwing Marion
kauflman Foundation to establish
the Genter in perpetuity.
I he other project is an inter
disciplinary initiative in the sci
ences that was recently awarded
$5.3 million In the Defense Ad
vanced Research Project Agencv,
a division <>! the U.S. Department
ol Defense.
A University-community
partnership
(lardner founded the center to
help various elements of commu
nities, such as educators, law en
forcement oHicers, social workers
and parents, work together to un
derstand and develop policies lor
young adults.
"[The Genter] is hard to com
municate or understand because
it isn't a conventional university
research center," said Milbrey
Mc Laughlin, an education profes
sor and a faculty member working
at the center.
McLaughlin explained that the
Gardner Genter is a University
community partnership, formed
to provide more eHeclive support
and opportunities for youth. She

said that young adults ages 12 to
20 are not seen as their own seg
ment of society and are often ig
nored in municipal planning bud
gets. McLaughlin hopes the cen
ter will "give their voice legitimacy
and authority."
The center's ultimate goal is to
create a model of community col
laboration for youth and to be
come a national resource for com
munities, universities, practition
ers and policy makers interested
in youth development and
learning.
lo achieve this aim, the cen
ter's agenda will focus on three
areas: Stanford, regional commu
nities and the nation. Fhecenter's
programs will create opportuni
ties lor Stanford's undergraduate
and graduate students and facul
ty to stuck youth in local commu
nities.
The communities can then use
this information to improve their
connections with their youth and
improve their programming.
Other universities and institu
tions across the country can study
these model programs, evaluate
and replicate them to help young
people everywhere.
Next month, some of the fund
ing from the grant will be used to
pa\ 15 Redwood G.itv teenagers
to interview their peers about the
youth programming they would
most like to see. This data will
then be evaluated In Mc Laugh
lin, her students and Redwood
Gity 2000, a community-based
group.
"1 anticipate it will be highly
successful, siiic 1 Beth Ross, execu
tive director of Redwood Git\
2000.
I he Gardner Genter will not
simplv use external communities
as a laboratory of study
