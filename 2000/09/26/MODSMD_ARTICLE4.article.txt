# $10 million grants will spur research in youth, science

What do a newly c reated center
lor the study ofyouth, genetics re
search and air traflic control have
in common? The answer is two
separate recently awarded $5-mil
lion grants, for revolutionary re
search into youth communities
and cellular interactions.
John Gardner, Glass ol '33,
founded the John Gardner Gen
ter for Youth and Their Gommu
nities with a $500,000 grant from
the William and Flora Hewlett
Foundation in July. The ("enter
received a $5 million grant on Fri
day from the Fwing Marion
kauflman Foundation to establish
the Genter in perpetuity.
I he other project is an inter
disciplinary initiative in the sci
ences that was recently awarded
$5.3 million In the Defense Ad
vanced Research Project Agencv,
a division <>! the U.S. Department
ol Defense.
A University-community
partnership
(lardner founded the center to
help various elements of commu
nities, such as educators, law en
forcement oHicers, social workers
and parents, work together to un
derstand and develop policies lor
young adults.
"[The Genter] is hard to com
municate or understand because
it isn't a conventional university
research center," said Milbrey
Mc Laughlin, an education profes
sor and a faculty member working
at the center.
McLaughlin explained that the
Gardner Genter is a University
community partnership, formed
to provide more eHeclive support
and opportunities for youth. She

said that young adults ages 12 to
20 are not seen as their own seg
ment of society and are often ig
nored in municipal planning bud
gets. McLaughlin hopes the cen
ter will "give their voice legitimacy
and authority."
The center's ultimate goal is to
create a model of community col
laboration for youth and to be
come a national resource for com
munities, universities, practition
ers and policy makers interested
in youth development and
learning.
lo achieve this aim, the cen
ter's agenda will focus on three
areas: Stanford, regional commu
nities and the nation. Fhecenter's
programs will create opportuni
ties lor Stanford's undergraduate
and graduate students and facul
ty to stuck youth in local commu
nities.
The communities can then use
this information to improve their
connections with their youth and
improve their programming.
Other universities and institu
tions across the country can study
these model programs, evaluate
and replicate them to help young
people everywhere.
Next month, some of the fund
ing from the grant will be used to
pa\ 15 Redwood G.itv teenagers
to interview their peers about the
youth programming they would
most like to see. This data will
then be evaluated In Mc Laugh
lin, her students and Redwood
Gity 2000, a community-based
group.
"1 anticipate it will be highly
successful, siiic 1 Beth Ross, execu
tive director of Redwood Git\
2000.
I he Gardner Genter will not
simplv use external communities
as a laboratory of study
McLaughlin added.
I his is a long-term commit
ment," she said.
She anticipates that these stud
ies should last three to live years.
Among the center's upcoming
initiatives is an undergraduate
class called "Urban Youth and
Their Institutions," which will re
quire students to volunteer in
local communities and study
youth there.
The Ethics and Society Pro
gram lead by Debra Sat/, of the
Philosophy Department will offer
a seminar on the ethics of univer
sity-community relations. The
Gardner Center is also working
with the Urban Studies Program
to create a masters degree in
Community Youth Development.
"The endowment money is
critical because it allows us to
make long-term commitments to
communities," McLaughlin said
"The [Gardner Center] is not
just a short-term Stanford project
but represents a partnership with
communities. Kauffman's gilt en
ables us to say that we're in this for
the long haul."
Both endowments were made
to honor Gardner's contributions

to issues concerning youth.
"He's a national treasure,"
McLaughlin said. "He gave Stan
lord's 100 th anniversary gradua
tion address â€” testimony to the
very high esteem in which Stan
ford holds him."
A "hospital on a chip"
The three-year defense re
search program brings together
10 Stanford professors from vari
ous scientific fields, including ge
netics, electrical engineering,
chemistry, physiology, aeronautics
and astronautics. The project's ob
jectives include developing new in
struments capable of analyzing cell
division and gene function instan
taneously.
"This is one of the most inter
esting and exciting projects I'm
working on now," said Claire j.
Tomlin, assistant professor of
aeronautics and astronautics.
Tomlin will use her expertise in
air traffic control to build a model
of how genes communicate within
a cell.
"We are working on a mathe
matical model to represent and
analyze numerous aircraft taking
off and landing simultaneously,"
she said. "We can apply a similar
model based on mathematical
principles to various biological

activities.
Olav Solgaard, an assistant pro
fessor of electrical engineering,
said his lab's goal is to make a lab
based on a chip.
"We want to miniaturize every
thing," he said. "Maybe we'll end
up one day with a hospital on a
chip that can be used to treat sol
diers in the field."
Harley McAdams, a senior sci
entist in the Department of Devel
opmental Biology in the School of
Medicine and the principle inves
tigator in the project, said that this
initiative "could completely
change the way biological re
search is done."
McAdams said that one of the
most difficult parts of the project
will be getting scientists to think
outside of their chosen fields.
"Right now, biologists don't un
derstand engineering and engi
neers don't understand biology,"
he said. "It's a clash of two cultures."
Stanford won the grant in part
because of the Bio-X program, an
other interdisciplinary science ini
tiative which singled Stanford out
as a leader in breaching academic
barriers for innovative research.
"The DARPA program is terrif
ic because it's Bio-X personified,"
said Lucy Shapiro, an investigator
and a co-founder of the Bio-X
program.
