1957
On September 27, 1957, the 10th annu
al Olympic Day torch race was run from
the Cellar to Mangini's Barn.
Along the race, yell leaders and specta
tors cheered on runners and song leaders
performed new routines. A car caravan
also followed the runners along their
route.
"The torch race was inaugurated dur
ing 'Back to the Farm' festivities in 1945.
The torch was passed by IS men along a
route which crossed Lake Lag by canoe
and ended at Rossotti's where the flame
was safely deposited in an abandoned toi
let bowl.
"Temporarily discontinued after 1946,
the marathon was reinstituted in 1950 and
has been carried out faithfully since then.
Year by year special features have been
started and then dropped.
Beer, baseball games, chug-a-lug con
tests and 'all the beer you can drink â€”
free' contests went their way, leaving the
race itself as the last survivor of' Back to
the Farm.'"
Bottom Line: What would the Olympics be like
if Stanford were in charge? Imagine the 2000
Sydney Olympics with lots of beer, lots of spir
it, lots of athleticism and the torch ending up in
a toilet bowl.
