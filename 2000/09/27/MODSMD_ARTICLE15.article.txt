## Milosevic concedes victory, demands runoff 
### 
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) — Slo
bodan Milosevic conceded yesterday
that his challenger finished first in
Yugoslavia's presidential election and
declared a runoff— defying demands
ai home and abroad that he step down.
Opposition candidate Vojislav Kos
tunica rejected an ()ct. 8 runoff, calling
it a "fraud" and insisting that he won
Sunday's election outright. At the same
time, lie warned against any moves
that could raise tensions and called on
the opposition to keep to a "nonvio
lent" response.
The opposition called fora rally
Wednesday night in downtown Bel
grade to "celebrate its victory" —
apparently hoping fora show of
strength to demonstrate to Milosevic
the public's refusal of a runoff.
President Clinton said it was clear
the opposition had defeated Milosevic,
who has led Yugoslavia for 13 years.
He said that the United States would
take steps to lift economic sanctions if

the election result is honored.
"Despite the government's attempts
to manipulate the vote, it does seem
clear that the people have voted for
change," Clinton said in a speech at
Georgetown University in Washing
ton.
The announcement of a runoff rais
es the stakes in the confrontation
between Milosevic and the opposition,
which faced the choice of accepting a
runoff it considers fraudulent or trying
to pressure the hardline leader —
believed to have a firm grip on the top
ranks of the police and military — to
back down.
Two days after the voting, the State
Elections Commission released its first
results yesterday, saying Kostunica fin
ished first with 48.22 percent to 40.23
percent for Milosevic. The law provid
ed a runoff Oct. 8 if none of the five
candidates received more than 50 per
cent of the votes cast.
Before the announcement, the

Democratic Opposition of Serbia
released its own tally, showing Kostu
nica with 55 percent to Milosevic's 35
percent. It said the figures were based
on 97.5 percent of tlie ballots and were
taken from reports by opposition poll
watchers at each precinct.
State television said the turnout was
()4 percent, far below the 74 percent
figure given by the opposition.
"We are talking about political fraud
and blatant stealing of votes," Kostuni
ca said. "This is an offer which must be
rejected." But he said the opposition
would avoid "careless moves which
could raise tensions in society, which
could lead to unforeseeable
consequences."
"The truth is obvious, and we will
defend it In all nonviolent means," the
opposition leader said. "The peo Pie
have given their political no' to Milose
vic and his policies."
fens of thousands of Yugoslavs
jammed the main squares in Belgrade

and other major c ities lor two straight
nights after the balloting, celebrating
the opposition win and demanding
Milosevic step down. Both nights, the
rallies ended without friction with
police, and Tuesday night there were
no crowds in the streets.
"For us, there is no runoff," Vladan
Batic, an anti-Milosevic activist, said.
"We won honestly and those who falsi
fied the results have to face criminal
charges."
Zoran Djindjic, another opposition
leader, demanded the electoral com
mission inspect the official returns, sav -
ing the government had removed
100,000 votes from Kostunica and
given half of them to Milosevic.
"We were aware of their intentions
because it was obvious the) were cook
ing up something to get Milosevic: in
the second round at least, Djincljic
said. "But we have firm evidence in oui
hands and we will defend the will of
the people till the end."
