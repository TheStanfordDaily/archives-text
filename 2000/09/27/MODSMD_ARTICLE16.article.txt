PRAtll K. ('.zecli Republic (AP) — Unleashinga
fresh round of fury against economic globaliza
tion, 5,000 proiesiers marched on the IMF and
World Bank summit yesterday, throwing lire
bombs, sti< ks and rocks .u police who respond
ed with clubs, tear gas and water cannons.
The enemies of capitalism didn't get the
20,000 activists they had hoped lor but were
still able to raise a ruckus that left at least 09
people injured and turned Prague into a
smoky battle /one.
Protesters threw Molotov cocktails and
rocks the) had made by breaking up a cobble
stone sidewalk. Authorities pushed demon
strators back each time they approached the
communist-era convention center where the
titans of global capitalism had huddled to pon
der economic issues. •
Hundreds of activists got so close, however,
that officials temporarily stopped the Interna
tional Monetary Fund and World Bank dele
gates and staff from leaving before evaluating
them through a subway station closed to the
public.
The skies over Prague filled with black
smoke alter some of the demonstrators built
barricades in the streets and set them ablaze,
also torching cars in what they billed as a
sequel to riots that marred recent economic
meetings in Seattle and Washington.
()ne of the main goals of the protesters had
been to trap the IMF and World Bank dele
gates inside the convention center, which hap
pened brielly. The lighting hurt at least 09
people, and 44 were hospitalized, including
34 police officers who were attacked by wave
after wave of protesters.
Czech President Vaclav I lavel appealed lor
calm, urging demonstrators to "abstain from
violent lbrms of protests."
After nightfall, a group of 200 anarchists
moved through the streets, smashing out
bank windows and demolishing a McDonald's
outlet — the second to be struck in the riot —
,md a RFC-. Police chased them away and the
city was mostly calm late Tuesday night.
Another 1,500 activists had blocked the
road outside the State Opera 1 louse, where a
reception for dignitaries was canceled, but
that protest laded without incident.
"The situation now is more stabilized,"
Interior Minister Stanislav Gross said.
Riot police were exhausted, so reinlorce

merits were being brought in, he said.
The protesters call globalization a menace
to humanity that helps the rich get richer at
the expense of the poor and the environment.
The IMF and World Bank have become
favored targets, as have capitalist icons such as
McDonald's.
South Africa's Finance Minister Trevor
Manuel, chairman of the summit, said it was
"a pit\ that it has descended into violence" hut
added it was unclear what the activists were
seeking as they fight the economic globaliza
tion trade officials call irreversible.
"I know what they're against but have no
sense of what they're for," Manuel said.
Many of the protesters — mostly from
Europe and representing a wide variety of
groups including anarchists, communists and
environmentalists — also seemed a bit fuzzy
on their goals.
"The bankers decide to spoil the world
during the day, and at night, they go to listen

to music and to rest," said Daniel Gomez, an
activist from Barcelona who joined the
demonstration outside the opera house.
"That's a bad joke."
"This is a battle for equal justice world
wide," explained a naked Swiss protester,
identifying himself only as Rafael.
In a throwback to U.S. anti-war demon
strations of the 19(>0s, some activists waved
banners saying "Make love not trade."
Rioters smashed the windows out of eight
ambulances, and for several hours, Prague
officials shut down an entire subway train line.
Czech authorities had mobilized 11,000
police to try to maintain control. Police said
some 5,000 people had turned out for the
protest.
Police spokeswoman Eva Miklikova saic 1 <u
least 'M people had bceirdelained for investi
gation of hooliganism and attac king public
officials, including 1 1 Germans, two Poles and
one British journalist, who was soon released.
