# Justice Department investigates FBI e-mail system
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (Al>) — I he
| list ice Department hired a ( hit a
go-based research group yester
day to analyze whether the FBl's
"Carnivore" e-mail surveillance
system has adequate protections
against abuse.
Fhe 11 1 Research Institute is
an independent, nonprofit
research and development orga
nization associated with the Illi
nois Institute of Fechnology. 1 he
department said the review team
would include senior faculty
members from the Chicago-Kent
(College of Law.
The review of Carnivore,
which lias drawn criticism from
Congress and civil libertarians,
will begin immediately and is to
be completed in December. An
interim draft report will be made
I >11 I>l1>1 ic for comment in late
November. Fhe linal report will
be released lor public comment in
December.
I he government will continue
to use the system during the
study. David Sobel, counsel lor
the Electronic Pri\ac\ Informa
tion Center, which tiled a Free
dom of Information Ac t lawsuit to
obtain documents about the svs
tem, lias c riticized the decision to
keep it in operation while ques
tions remain.
Fhe department estimated 11 it*
study would cost $175,000, but
the exact amount will depend on
time and materials consumed.
The Carnivore system,
installed In the FBI on the net
work of Internet service
providers, has software that sc.ins
Internet traffic as it moves
through that provider's network.
Fhe FBI savs it configures the

software to capture e-mail to or
from someone under investiga
tion ant 1 that court orders limit
which e-mails agents can see.
But privacy advocates sav only
the FBI knows what Carnivore
can do, and Internet providers
are not allowed access to the svs
tem. l liey .isk win the FBI retains
control of Carnivore equipment
and doesn't give it to internet
providers so tliwv can comply with
court orders.
The project's goal is to see il
Carnivore increases the risk that
FBI agents or anyone — inten
tionalh or unintentionally, legalh
or illegal!} — will see electronic
communications they should not
see and whether Carnivore can
safeguard against that risk.
" Fhe review team will have full
access to any information they
need to perform their review,"
said Assistant Attorney General
Stephen I\. Colgate, who led the
selection team. "This organiza
tion has both the technical exper
tise and the dedication to the pro
ject to provide the most thor
ough. independent and timely
review."
Some academics objected to
department insistence on both
security checks of evaluation
panel members and on veto
power over any c hanges in that
panel, saving it could exclude crit
ics of government surveillance.
I he\ also i ritic ized Justice's insis
tence on the light to edit the
report. Ihe Massachusetts Insti
tute ol Fechnology withdrew
from the bidding because of its
objections, said a senior Justice
official, who spoke on condition of
anonvmitv.
