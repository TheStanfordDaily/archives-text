CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — OPEC mem
bers sidestepped growing demands yesterday
that they increase oil production as the cartel's
first summit in 25 years began in Venezuela's
spruced-up capital.

but yesterday President Hugo Chavez said he
didn't think it was necessary. The index of
crude oil prices that C )PEC watches was $2 ( .).09

a barrel ai the close of markets Monda\. clou n
from about $31 midmonth.
"1 respect the decision, but I wouldn't have
used the reserve in tliis case. I his isn't an
extraordinary situation. lliere is no extraordi
nary situation," Chavez told reporters after
welcoming Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheik Sand
Nasser AI Sabah at Caracas Simon Bolivar
international airport. "Our battle is for fail
prices."

said he was concerned about talk that W ash
ington was considering releasing more oil.
OPEC would be compelled to cut production
if oil dropped below $22 per bat tel, he said.
I he cartel has set a so-called "price band' of
$22 to $28 per barrel.
