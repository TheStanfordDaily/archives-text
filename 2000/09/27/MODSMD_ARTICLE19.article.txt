## The
						Stanford Daily Dish modifications unpleasant and unjustified 
### 
Published Since JH9I

The outcome of the new Dish
regulations has been a surprise
and a disappointment to Uni
versity affiliates and area resi
dents alike.
In May, The Daily wrote in support of
the conservation and use plan, com
mending Stanford's attempt to preserve
the land.
Although the plan appeared desirable at
its unveiling, The Daily can no long sup
port the new regulations due to the man
ner in which they have been enacted.
As with other open space preserves such
as Jasper Ridge, the University claimed
that a stricter usage policy was needed to
protect the Foothills from environmental
degradation. Activities such as picnicking
and dog-walking can upset nat ural ecosys
tems in irreversible ways.
We applauded the University's recogni
tion of responsibility for the preservation
of the Foothills area.
The positive aspects of the plan have

been undermined by the paving of the
four-mile loop, the implementation of
patrolling officers on motorized recre
ational vehicles, superfluous sign posting
and the stationing of armed guards.
The University presented the plan as a
means to preserve the environmental
integrity of the Foothills. The decision to
pave the loop and to use motorized vehicles
in the area clearly acts against this intent.
Neither have the regulations contribut
ed to the recreational potential of the
land. The 55 signs posted along the
"Recreational Route" obstruct the view
and disturb the sanctity of the space. Fur
ther, with the concrete road now serving
as the only permissable route for joggers,
there is no soft ground to protect runners
from impact-related injuries.
Many residents of the surrounding area
feel understandably alienated by the Uni
versity's actions. Because the Dish is now
inaccessible shortly after working hours
and dogs are no longer permitted, access

to residents is severely restricted. The
armed guards also contribute to an
uncomfortable and unwelcoming envi
ronment for visitors and students.
At a time when a good relationship to
area residents is both at risk and neces
sary, in light of the upcoming review of
the land use plan, it seems foolish for the
University to sacrifice general peace fora
goal — environmental integrity — it obvi
ously cares little about. In short, what
once appeared to be a thinly veiled
attempt to place distance between Stan
lord and area residents has become an
obvious insult to students and community
members alike.
The closing off of the trails in the
Foothills is a great disappointment to
nature lovers at Stanford. When there is
little perceivable gain, environmental or
otherwise, the loss of a peaceful and
expansive escape for students and resi
dents is unacceptable.
I he University has not been account-

able for its actions in this matter, which
were not disclosed to the public in
advance and which clearly contradict its
stated aims.
Any further actions in the Foothills
must be discussed openly before enact
ment. The University is responsible for
justifying its actions and for demonstrat
ing how these new measures improve
conditions for students.
Based on the deviation away from the
original, laudable goal of the conservation
and use plan, we call for an end to the
draconian regulations.
The trails should again be opened to
hikers and dogs. The hours should no
longer be restricted, and the signs should
be removed. While the police patrol route
is a postive safety measure, the armed
guards are gratuitious and unnecessary.
One would be hard pressed to argue
that dogs and hikers do as much environ
mental damage as University-ordered
pavement and motorized vehicles.
