# Bookstore to offer car rental services to alleviate frosh parking ban
## Enterprising Solutions 
### COLLEEN O'BRIEN 
Starting this fall, the Stanford
Bookstore is offering rental car
services to minimize the incon
venience of off-campus travel,
particularly for incoming fresh
men.
The Class of 2004 is the first
to feel the effects of a policy insti-

tuted in the
spring of
1999 that de
nies parking
permits to all
freshmen.
The Uni-

versity has taken measures to
make adequate alternative
transportation available, one of
which is a contract negotiated
with Enterprise Rent-a-Car, one
of the nation's largest rental car
services.
Enterprise will offer Stanford
students and faculty a 15 to 20
percent discount off normal
rental car rates, as well as special
promotional deals set up
around the University's acade
mic calendar.
More importantly, Enter
prise will allow rentals to stu
dents between the ages of 18 and
21, an age group normally de
nied the privilege because of its
high insurance risk. Many agen
cies will not rent to drivers
under 25, and 21 is generally the
youngest age people can rent
cars.
However, Enterprise will
allow rentals to students 18 and
over if they provide a Stanford
ID, proof of full insurance cov

erage and a credit card in their
own name.
These criteria may still he dif
ficult to meet for some students.
"The insurance might be a
problem for me," said senior
Margaret Bruce. "But it still
widens my options. 1 think ii will
be helpful when friends and
family visit me."
Dean of Students Marc VVais
calls the program a "bold and
creative concept."
"Many universities don't
allow cars on campus," he said.
"But I know of no other school
in this country that offers their
students rental car services."
The Bookstore now has a di
rect phone line to Enterprise set
up behind its customer service
area, so that customers do not
have to dial the number. In fact,
they simply pick up the receiver
and are automatically connected
to an Enterprise representative.
Enterprise also offers a pick
up service. After reserving a car,
customers arrange a time and
place to be picked up and driven
to the Enterprise office in Palo
Alto, where their car will be wait
ing.
Prices vary depending on the
kind of vehicle rented and the
number of days needed. Fora
single day, the cost ranges from
$39 fora modest Geo Metro to
$149 to cruise El Camino in a
Cadillac. While most students
probably won't want to pay for
luxury, they may want to pay for
space. Students can rent trucks,
