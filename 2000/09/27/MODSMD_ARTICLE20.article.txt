## Spartans give Card all it can handle in 1-1 tie Cardinal winning streak ends at six; Zapala surrenders first goal of the year 
### ALEX BENJAMIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For liic first six games of the season, the No. 13
Stanford men's soccer team has beaten opponents
easily, going undefeated and shutting every oppo
nent out. Last night, the team took its untainted
record to Spartan Stadium, home of 7-0 San Jose
State, fora game that in the past has been one of
Stanford's toughest and would prove to be the same
last night, with the Spartans tying the Cardinal 1-1.
l he challenge was quickly realized when Spar
tan Lars Lyssand scored the first goal of the game
in the 12th minute. It was the first goal Stanford
had allowed in t he 2000 season, and it made a point
that this game would in fact be a challenge for the
C lardinal.
With both teams playing strong defense, much of
the play in the first hall ended up in the middle sec
tion ol tlie field, allowing only limited offensive
opportunities.
It would not be until the 34th minute that Stan
ford senior Scott Leber would break the 1-0 deficit
after heading home a ball played into the box by ju
nior Lee Morrison. I lie goal was Leber's eighth of
the season, which leads the team, and tied the score
at one apiece.
Despite Stanford's physical dominance on the
field, they were unable to find the back of the net for
a second time, and this is how the game would end

alter the 90 minutes of regulation play and 30 min
utes of sudden death overtime.
()neol the notable aspects of the game was the out
standing play of senior goalkeeper Adam Zapala.
Voted a preseason All-American, Zapala lias not had
much of an opportunity to show oil his ability until
this point.
"Adam has not been overtested," said Stanford
head coach Bobby ('.lark. "He has been very vocal and
a great leader, but that is the first game that he has
been forced to make some excellent saves."
Despite allowing his first goal of the season, the
saves Zapala made last night were a big reason for the
final outcome of the game.
"It's always a tough match coming into San Jose,
because its a small field, and not the greatest surface
in the world, and San Jose State gets up when they
play Stanford so its going to be a battle," said Zapala.
Clark reflected on the difficulty of the game, but
was overall pleased with how the game went.
"The shots were pretty even and I think both teams
had their chances," said Clark, "[but] I suppose we
could take a little more out of it playing at their place.
"1 said before that this was going to be out first real
test, and it was. We've got two great teams here and
it's always a very difficult game."
()n the opposite side of the ball Spartan head coach
Gary St. Clair also found the tie satisfying.
"A tie against Stanford is a good result," St. ('.lair said,
"li wasa great test for us. Although I'm disappointed in
the result, I'm very proud of how this team played."
With Stanford at an impressive 6-0-1 record, they
will now prepare themselves for this weekend's Nike
Tournament to be held at New Maloney Field. Friday
the Cardinal will face Seton Hall, and Cincinnati on
Sunday.
