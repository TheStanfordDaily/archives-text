lie's still the same John McEnroe.
A former Stanford tennis player,

round-robin senior tournament at
the Taubc Family Tennis Stadium.

Before winning the tournament
on Sunda\ afternoon at what he
called "the best college in the coun
try," McEnroe battled Frenchman
Henri Leconte a day earlier in a
match that at times more closely re
sembled a citrus performance than
an athletic duel.
Matching McEnroe's usu.il an

In displaying his unathletic .'l7-year
old body during an injury timeout.

WILLIAM WEST/The Stanford Daily
Even at 41 ( John McEnroe remains a fierce competitor and a dominant per
sonality in the tennis world.
While \l< Kll roe is eertainh
having lun dominating the senior
tin mi against old rivals |iiiimy
Connors and Bjorn Borg, lie li.ts
not I<>rj4<Â»tten his one-war stun <n
Stanford.
I nlike other tennis players of
his caliber such as Andre Agassi
,ind I'ele Sampras. \l<Knroe, who
was a seniilinalisl .it Wimbledon be
lore entering Stanford, decided lo
go to< ollege lot the 1977-78 s< hoot
vear instead of heading directly to
the pros.
"first oil. 1 just wanted lo enjoy
the college experience," McKnroe
said about Ins decision to come to
Stanford. "Second ol all, I didn't
It-el like I was prepared toeven turn
professional. 1 needed time to get
[into] the right mindset. Hie op
p< >rtiulit\ to come here and be the

favorite, and [to have] pressure on
me, was something I [thought]
(ould help me in the long run. It
turned out to be a great move lor
my career."
McKnroe made the most out ol
his year at the Farm, from an athlet
ic standpoint at least, lie not onl\
captured the NCAA singles title but
also led the Cardinal to the team
< hampionship.
Alter his freshmen year, McKn
roe left Stanford to embark on a ten
nis career in which he won seven
(irand Slams. McKnroe was content
saving goodbve to the University
alter one vear and has no plans to
return to finish his degree.
"But I can always come back,
right?" he joked. "It's an open door
policy."
Today, McKnroe is probably
known lor his oil-court candidness
as much as his oil-court excellence.
During the past lew weeks, he
has engaged in a war of words with
female tennis sensations Venus

and Serena Williams, which began
while McKnroe was commentating
dining this year's U.S. Open on
television. I he Williams sisters
have won three out of the last live
(irand Slam titles, with Venus win
ning both Wimbledon and the U.S.
()pen this year.
"What they have achieved is
great," McKnroe said in referring to
the Williams sisters in Britain's Sun
day Telegraph, "but they have no
respect lor anyone in the game. You
just don't see their kind of behavior
in other sports.
"Serena started it when she said a
year ago that she should play a cou
ple ol men's tournaments. Do
women golfers say thev could go out
and beat Tiger Woods? Do women
boxers think they could knock out
Lennox Lewis? ()l course not."
McKnroe also demonstrated his
opinionated demeanor when ques
tioned about his alma mater. While
he c laims that he enjoyed his time at
Stanford, he refused to be specilic.

Asked if he had any interesting
stones about his year at the Univer
sity, McKnroe replied, "Not that I
c an repeat in your paper." .
When questioned about which
room number he stayed in at Stan
lord, the former Kinconada resi
dent replied, "I'm not sure. Ask
(loach [Dick Gould]. He came to
track me down whenever I was mis
behaving."
McKnroe also had advice for
Stanfi >i (l senior Alex Kim and other
men's collegiate tennis players. Kim
won the NCA\ singles champi
onship last spring and might forgo
his final season at Stanford to turn
professional.
"The only time I saw [Kim] play
was when he played Agassi," McKn
roe said. "Based on that, I recom
mend him playing [at Stanford] an
other year. But he also played one of
the greatest players who ever lived
in the center court at the U.S. ()pen.
I hat's hardly a fair comparison for
me to say."

"Ill were in charge, I'd encour
age a lot of these people to stay in
school longer," McEnroe added. "I
don't think most ofthese players are
ready to play professional to be hon
est."
McKnroe believes that collegiate
tennis would be a lot stronger il the
players had a greater incentive to
stay at school.
"Clollege tennis itself has sort of
lost some of its luster since the days I
was playing," he said. "That's one
reason why I wish the ()lympics was
amateur, because I think it would
encourage kids to stay in college
more, and I think you'd see
stronger college players."
If McKnroe hadn't come to Stan
lord as one of the l)est junior tennis
players in the world, he might have
stayed at the University a lot longer
to fulfill his "other" dream.
When asked what he would l>e if
he hadji't been a tennis player,
McKnroe amusingly responded,
"nuclear physicist."
