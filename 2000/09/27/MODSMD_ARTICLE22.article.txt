### MATT LONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Football is war.
Think of I lie gridiron as the battlefield, and
the team as an arm) heading into battle. As
the army is only as good as the general leading
iis forces, the looiball team cannot sustain vic
tory without an outstanding quarterback.
Nowhere is this more evident than in the
Pacific 10 Conference. The last seven confer
ence champions have been commanded by
the eventual All-I'ac-10 quarterback, most re

cently Stanford and the consistent if not spec
tacular Todd Husak. But Husak is gone,
grabbed in the sixth round of the NFL draft
by the Washington Redskins.
Husak's departure for the NFL left an heir
apparent in backup Joe Borchard. who
demonstrated flashes of brilliance against
UCLA with a five-touchdown game last sea
son. But baseball scouts came calling, and
Borchard now suits up for the Chicago White
Sox organization.
Bore hard's exit left redshirt junior Randy
Fasani with a long-desired chance to start at

Stanford's glamour position. Kasani was
hailed as the most athletic Cardinal signal
taller, seeing spot duty as linebacker, tight
end and in special teams last year, as well .is as
suming the role of third string quarterback.
But alter a strong debut, Fasani's chance was
cut short when the hard-hitting Texas Long
horns injured his knee early in the lirst quar
ter on Sept. 16th.
So it will be redshirt freshman Chris Ix-wis
who leads the Cardinal offense as commander-

With Todd Husak (7), Joe Borchard (11) and Randy Fasani (12), Stanford has enjoyed sterling play at quarterback for the past two seasons. Now Chris
Lewis (10) and Teyo Johnson (5) look to continue the Cardinal tradition through 2000 and beyond.
