# Lewis latest to lead at "Quarterback U"

### MATT LONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Football is war.
Think of I lie gridiron as the battlefield, and
the team as an arm) heading into battle. As
the army is only as good as the general leading
iis forces, the looiball team cannot sustain vic
tory without an outstanding quarterback.
Nowhere is this more evident than in the
Pacific 10 Conference. The last seven confer
ence champions have been commanded by
the eventual All-I'ac-10 quarterback, most re

cently Stanford and the consistent if not spec
tacular Todd Husak. But Husak is gone,
grabbed in the sixth round of the NFL draft
by the Washington Redskins.
Husak's departure for the NFL left an heir
apparent in backup Joe Borchard. who
demonstrated flashes of brilliance against
UCLA with a five-touchdown game last sea
son. But baseball scouts came calling, and
Borchard now suits up for the Chicago White
Sox organization.
Bore hard's exit left redshirt junior Randy
Fasani with a long-desired chance to start at

Stanford's glamour position. Kasani was
hailed as the most athletic Cardinal signal
taller, seeing spot duty as linebacker, tight
end and in special teams last year, as well .is as
suming the role of third string quarterback.
But alter a strong debut, Fasani's chance was
cut short when the hard-hitting Texas Long
horns injured his knee early in the lirst quar
ter on Sept. 16th.
So it will be redshirt freshman Chris Ix-wis
who leads the Cardinal offense as commander-

With Todd Husak (7), Joe Borchard (11) and Randy Fasani (12), Stanford has enjoyed sterling play at quarterback for the past two seasons. Now Chris
Lewis (10) and Teyo Johnson (5) look to continue the Cardinal tradition through 2000 and beyond.
in-chief, alter being third on the
depth chart just over a month ago.
This Saturday he will lead the Car
dinal (2-1,1-OPac-lO) into an attack
on the Arizona Wildcats (2-1) in his
first career start for Stanford.
1 hrust into the game against
then-No. f> Texas, Lewis calmh
guided the Cardinal to a 27-24 vin
by passing for 214 yards and three
touchdowns, with no intercep
tions. Most importantly, he orches
trated an Elwayesque drive to win
the game in fourth (juaiter,
capped by a lf)-yard touchdown
pass to Deßonnie Pitts with onh
1:12 remaining.
While tht- Lewis-Pitts connec
tion may not make the Stanford
faithful forget the remarkable
( hemistry between I Insak a:id de
parted receiver Trov Walters,
Lewis demonstrated remarkable

composure in the pocket, belying
the fact that the game was only the
second of his collegiate career.
Lewis said that remaining
poised under pressure has never
been a problem in his sports ca
reer. "I don't get nervous," he says.
"I will the first play maybe but after
that I don't. I was even calm in that
last drive against Texas."
I lead coach Tyrone Willingham
feels little need to worry about
Lewis's lack of experience, deferring
to 1-ewis's natural athletic ability.
"He's been a quarterback for
some time, he's worked on the po
sition. and he has an understand
ing of the position," Willingham
said. "He brings athleticism as
being both a standout athlete in
lootball in his high school career
and also a volleyball player."
In Lewis, the Cardinal coach
ing stall has an high school All-
American who was the most highly
recruited quarterback in America
his senior vear. In his final season
at Long Beach Poly High School,

Lewis was named the 1998
Gatorade National High School
Football Player of the Year. He
owns the California state record
lor touchdown passes.
Lewis is also aided by the fact
that Stanford is coming off of a bye
week into the Arizona game. "1
think [the bye] does help Chris be
cause he now he lias more oppor
tunities to take snaps," says VVill
ingham. "II it were just one week,
then you only have one week of
preparation, whether we focused
all of our time on Arizona or not.
Now, he lias more information to
recall and .ill that helps you be a
better player."
But what happens il Lewis
somehow goes the way of Bor
i hard and Fasani? Improbable as it
would seem, coaches would call on
true freshman Teyojohnson, who
has gone from a probable rcdshirt
to backup quarterback.
Johnson carries on the pedigree
of top Cardinal quarterback re
cruits. At (w" <ind 250 lbs., he

played quarterback, wide receiver
and defensive end lor Mira Mesa
High School in San Diego. John
son also planned to c laim his posi
tion on the basketball team after
Stanford's run towards the Pac-10
title, although that plan max now
be put on hold.
Riall Johnson, who is Teyo's
brother in addition to being an All-
Pac-10 linebacker for the (lardinal,
has faith that No. 5 is ready to step
in and take snaps if the Arizona
game necessitates it.
"Teyo asks me if 1 think lie's
ready," Riall says."I le knows I'll be
straight up with him. I think he is.
He's confident and even cocky at
times. I le loves being in big sitna
tions, and he's probably the best
improviser on the team."
Willingham is unsure of the
path his young quarterback will
tread this season. When asked
whether Johnson will be awarded
playing time as a backup, Willing
ham expresses uncertaintv.
Stanford's talent at the quar

terback position remains a high
point ofthe football program. Yet
the question remains as to
whether Lewis (or Johnson) (.m
lead the Cardinal successfully
with such limited experience.
Fasani undergoes surgery on a
torn meniscus in his left knee on
Friday, and there is a good
chance doctors will find a torn an
terior cruciate ligament .is well.
With recovery for Fasani likelv to
last eight to nine months, Lewis
will have plenty of lime to get ac
climated to life in the Pac-10.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal
needs a star quarterback to estab
lish its place in the conference —
and quickly.
"When we talk about defining
our team in 2000, Willingham
says, "we're talking about identify
ing a quarterback and Ins role.
The sooner that player and his
individual abilities plot the battle
plans lor the team, the soonei it
can march conlidenth into the wat
that is the Pac-10 season.

the question remains as to
whether Lewis (or Johnson) (.m

with such limited experience.

With recovery for Fasani likelv to

will have plenty of lime to get ac

needs a star quarterback to estab
lish its place in the conference —
and quickly.
"When we talk about defining
our team in 2000, Willingham
says, "we're talking about identify

The sooner that player and his
individual abilities plot the battle

Football is war.
Think of I lie gridiron as the battlefield, and
the team as an arm) heading into battle. As
the army is only as good as the general leading
iis forces, the looiball team cannot sustain vic
tory without an outstanding quarterback.
Nowhere is this more evident than in the
Pacific 10 Conference. The last seven confer
ence champions have been commanded by
the eventual All-I'ac-10 quarterback, most re

cently Stanford and the consistent if not spec
tacular Todd Husak. But Husak is gone,
grabbed in the sixth round of the NFL draft
by the Washington Redskins.
Husak's departure for the NFL left an heir
apparent in backup Joe Borchard. who
demonstrated flashes of brilliance against
UCLA with a five-touchdown game last sea
son. But baseball scouts came calling, and
Borchard now suits up for the Chicago White
Sox organization.
Bore hard's exit left redshirt junior Randy
Fasani with a long-desired chance to start at

Stanford's glamour position. Kasani was
hailed as the most athletic Cardinal signal
taller, seeing spot duty as linebacker, tight
end and in special teams last year, as well .is as
suming the role of third string quarterback.
But alter a strong debut, Fasani's chance was
cut short when the hard-hitting Texas Long
horns injured his knee early in the lirst quar

So it will be redshirt freshman Chris Ix-wis

With Todd Husak (7), Joe Borchard (11) and Randy Fasani (12), Stanford has enjoyed sterling play at quarterback for the past two seasons. Now Chris
Lewis (10) and Teyo Johnson (5) look to continue the Cardinal tradition through 2000 and beyond.

depth chart just over a month ago.
This Saturday he will lead the Car
dinal (2-1,1-OPac-lO) into an attack
on the Arizona Wildcats (2-1) in his
first career start for Stanford.
1 hrust into the game against
then-No. f> Texas, Lewis calmh
guided the Cardinal to a 27-24 vin
by passing for 214 yards and three
touchdowns, with no intercep
tions. Most importantly, he orches
trated an Elwayesque drive to win
the game in fourth (juaiter,
capped by a lf)-yard touchdown
pass to Deßonnie Pitts with onh
1:12 remaining.
While tht- Lewis-Pitts connec
tion may not make the Stanford
faithful forget the remarkable
( hemistry between I Insak a:id de
parted receiver Trov Walters,
Lewis demonstrated remarkable

composure in the pocket, belying
the fact that the game was only the
second of his collegiate career.
Lewis said that remaining
poised under pressure has never
been a problem in his sports ca
reer. "I don't get nervous," he says.
"I will the first play maybe but after
that I don't. I was even calm in that
last drive against Texas."
I lead coach Tyrone Willingham
feels little need to worry about
Lewis's lack of experience, deferring
to 1-ewis's natural athletic ability.
"He's been a quarterback for
some time, he's worked on the po
sition. and he has an understand
ing of the position," Willingham
said. "He brings athleticism as
being both a standout athlete in
lootball in his high school career
and also a volleyball player."
In Lewis, the Cardinal coach
ing stall has an high school All-
American who was the most highly
recruited quarterback in America
his senior vear. In his final season
at Long Beach Poly High School,

Lewis was named the 1998
Gatorade National High School
Football Player of the Year. He
owns the California state record
lor touchdown passes.
