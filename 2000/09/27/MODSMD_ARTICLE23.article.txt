during the Americans' stupendous
live-game victon 1 uesda\ can only
help them when the\ pla\ Russia in
the semifinals. And ilie\ have their
hard-nosed Asian rivals to thank.
"It's motivation," said lornier
Stanibrd player Kerri Walsh, whose
fingertip save helped the I S. team
comeback from a 12-9 deficit in the
deciding game. " I hev're ama/ing.
I want to be as g< tod .is them. I want

Hie I lined States lias learned
from the best at this tournament,
and has kept on improving. Now
it's in the final lour, guaranteed ol .1

with .t once-unthinkable shot at
going for gold.
"I don't 11 link we should pla\ lor

said coach Mick Haley. " I he won
derful thing about our countr\ is
that our kids are brought up even
da\ to think that il ilie\ work hard,
lliev can be successful.
"We knew cominu here ih.it, no

matter what our track record was, if
we did everything right and we
worked hard, we would have a
chance to win. We dropped our
selves in that position, now let's see
if we can win."
I he l .S. and South Korean
teams were as closely matched as
could be, and the final points ol the
26-24, 17-25, 25-23, 25-27, 16-14
American victon were the most riv
eting of the tournament.
I'railing bv three points — a
huge lead lor this match — the
Americans got within 12-1 I on a kill
and bloc k b\ Danielle Scott. Walsh
then chased down a hopclessh wide
ballne.u the I S. bench and baited
it back to her teammates. Stai hitler
and Stanford sophomore Logan
fom ended up with the winner 10
tie it.
"I don't even remember, Walsh
said ol her delensive stops. "I was so
foe used on defense. I had nothing
else 111 m\ mind, just don't let the
ball hit the floor."
()n the next sequence, Walsh hit
the deck to get an index linger
under a spiked ball, and fom
wound up with the kill again.
"We knew in our hearts that we
could pull this oil," fom said.
I he match ended somew hat an
tic liinac tic alb with an official's c all.
After fom dropped in a dmk to
end a long rallv and give the U.S.

team a 15-14 lead. South Korea's
Ku Min-Jung fired ,i hall down the
left line that the official called out.
1 he South Koreans protested, but
the Americans jumped up and
down in celebration.
"I've been on this team for al
most two years, and this is what
even single day — all the sweat, all
the blood, all the tears, all the hap
piness— this is where it all came
down, to this game," said libero
Stacy Svkora. "I don't think I've ex
perienced vet in my lifetime a game
like this.''
Walsh, who graduated from
Stanford last June, has had surgery
on both shoulders and was on the
team more for her blocking skills
than hitting. She missed the first
two games in group play while re
covering from a twisted ankie suf
fered in the (>rand Prix tourna
ment six weeks ago.
With the smaller South Koreans
getting a surprisingly strong block
up on Tom and Scott, I laley decid
ed to diversify the offense and run
more pla\ s for Walsh.
She was shaky at times, but
began swinging with confidence.
In the third game, South Korea
had pulled within 24-23, Inn Walsh
delivered a stinging smash from the
light side lor the winner. Setter
Robvn Ah Mow had Scott on her
lelt but went i<» Walsh instead, and

it paid oil.
"II I'm more involved in the
game, then I get my confidence up.
and hopefully the team will be able
to rely on me in crucial situations
like that," Walsh said.
l he Americans knew South
Korea wore down opponents men
tally by digging everything, so they
had to be prepared for some ago

nizingly long rallies.
"We just were really patient,"
Scott said. "From the beginning we
were like, 'They're going to dig a lot
of balls, but we're taller than they
are, we're stronger than they are.
Let's use that to our advantage,' and
it worked for us."
fhe U.S. team, which finished
seventh in Atlanta and never has

won a gold medal, now takes on ;i
Russian earn that has won linn
golds and three silvers, and is hun
gry to avenge its Iburth-place show
ing in 1990.
"It's ail awesome feeling to have
won this milch, but we have to let it

we need back in the gym and

if we can win."
I he l .S. and South Korean
teams were as closely matched as
could be, and the final points ol the
26-24, 17-25, 25-23, 25-27, 16-14
American victon were the most riv
eting of the tournament.
I'railing bv three points — a
huge lead lor this match — the
Americans got within 12-1 I on a kill
and bloc k b\ Danielle Scott. Walsh
then chased down a hopclessh wide
ballne.u the I S. bench and baited
it back to her teammates. Stai hitler
and Stanford sophomore Logan
fom ended up with the winner 10
tie it.
"I don't even remember, Walsh
said ol her delensive stops. "I was so
foe used on defense. I had nothing
else 111 m\ mind, just don't let the
ball hit the floor."
()n the next sequence, Walsh hit
the deck to get an index linger
under a spiked ball, and fom
wound up with the kill again.
"We knew in our hearts that we
could pull this oil," fom said.
I he match ended somew hat an

After fom dropped in a dmk to
end a long rallv and give the U.S.

team a 15-14 lead. South Korea's
Ku Min-Jung fired ,i hall down the
left line that the official called out.
1 he South Koreans protested, but
the Americans jumped up and
down in celebration.
"I've been on this team for al
most two years, and this is what
even single day — all the sweat, all
the blood, all the tears, all the hap
piness— this is where it all came
down, to this game," said libero
Stacy Svkora. "I don't think I've ex
perienced vet in my lifetime a game
like this.''
Walsh, who graduated from
Stanford last June, has had surgery
on both shoulders and was on the
team more for her blocking skills
than hitting. She missed the first
two games in group play while re
covering from a twisted ankie suf
fered in the (>rand Prix tourna
ment six weeks ago.
With the smaller South Koreans
getting a surprisingly strong block
up on Tom and Scott, I laley decid
ed to diversify the offense and run
more pla\ s for Walsh.
She was shaky at times, but
began swinging with confidence.
In the third game, South Korea
had pulled within 24-23, Inn Walsh
delivered a stinging smash from the
light side lor the winner. Setter
Robvn Ah Mow had Scott on her
lelt but went i<» Walsh instead, and

it paid oil.
"II I'm more involved in the
game, then I get my confidence up.
and hopefully the team will be able
to rely on me in crucial situations
like that," Walsh said.
l he Americans knew South
Korea wore down opponents men
tally by digging everything, so they
had to be prepared for some ago

nizingly long rallies.
"We just were really patient,"
Scott said. "From the beginning we
were like, 'They're going to dig a lot
of balls, but we're taller than they
are, we're stronger than they are.
Let's use that to our advantage,' and
it worked for us."
fhe U.S. team, which finished
seventh in Atlanta and never has

won a gold medal, now takes on ;i
Russian earn that has won linn
golds and three silvers, and is hun
gry to avenge its Iburth-place show
ing in 1990.
"It's ail awesome feeling to have
won this milch, but we have to let it
go," Scott said. "As exciting as it was,
we need back in the gym and
prepare for Russia."
