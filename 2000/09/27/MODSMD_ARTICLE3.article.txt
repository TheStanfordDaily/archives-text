### MEGAN KNIZE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Faculty members and other University
employees who were expecting to move
into Stanford's newest housing complex
this Saturday will have to wait a few more
weeks. After a year of construction, offi
cials from the Stanford West apartments
announced recently that the first. 60 ten
ants can move into the complex on Oct. 13.
The apartment complex, located west
of campus off Sand Hill Road, boasts two
and three-bedroom apartments for Stan
ford faculty, staff and employees who work
on Stanford land. The apartments provide
affordable housing close to campus. When
completed next fail, the complex will have
628 housing units.
"October 1 was a best-case scenario,"
said Heather Wallace, the project's senior
property manager. Wallace added that ob
taining permits and completing inspec
tions can take longer than expected. "But
most of the residents are really looking

forward to moving in."
Only people who are employed by the
University and working at least 30 hours a
week can apply for housing in Stanford
West. Carolyn Sargent, director of faculty
and staff housing, said the apartments will
help attract and keep new faculty.
"We certainly hope it will he an interim
housing option, and we've already had 40
or 50 new faculty apply," Sargent said.
Apartment leases will be negotiated annu
ally.
"We have wonderful amenities," Sar
gent said, pointing to each unit's large
windows, private deck or courtyard and
high-speed Internet connections. The
complex is also home to a completed club
house for meetings and social functions,
and a huge fitness facility.
Eighty percent of the first 60 units will
be filled by faculty, Wallace said, and the
remaining units will house staff members.

Main people have applied for
the housing not just because it's
close tti work, but also because it's
cheaper than comparable apart
ments nearbv.
" 1 he market rate in Palo Alto

is $3 a square foot," Wallace said.
"The Stanford rate is $2.25 a
square foot." Renting a three
bedroom, 1,300-square foot unit
at Stanford West would he
$1,000 cheaper each month, she
added.
An additional benefit of Stan
ford West is that 10 percent of the
new units are available at a price
that's further below the market
rate. To qualify for such an apart
ment. a single-person household
must have an annual income
below $48,700. The monthly rent
for these apartments is $734 fora
one-bedroom place. Six such
units will open in October.
The same apartments at the
standard rate range from $1,470
to $1,930. Wallace said there is a
300 percent demand for the
lower-priced housing units.
Stanford West is one of four

projects to improve the Sand Hill
Road area. Housing options
there have been discussed for the
past 20 years, Wallace said. In
1992, Stanford decided to create
projects that included senior
housing expansion, a large shop
ping center and the widening of
Sand Hill Road.
But for now, many people are
just content with exploring the
area in and around the new
apartments.
"We have a bike trail and an
historic walking trail," Wallace
said, adding that the clubhouse
building is home to many historic
artifacts, including an old Stan
ford pennant and a picture of Le
land Stanford Jr.
"I've got a picture of this area
in 1887, and before it was [a
bunch of] trees and a cow," Wal
lace said. "And now it's this."
