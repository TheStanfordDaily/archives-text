Faculty members and other University
employees who were expecting to move
into Stanford's newest housing complex
this Saturday will have to wait a few more
weeks. After a year of construction, offi
cials from the Stanford West apartments
announced recently that the first. 60 ten
ants can move into the complex on Oct. 13.
The apartment complex, located west
of campus off Sand Hill Road, boasts two
and three-bedroom apartments for Stan
ford faculty, staff and employees who work
on Stanford land. The apartments provide
affordable housing close to campus. When
completed next fail, the complex will have
628 housing units.
"October 1 was a best-case scenario,"
said Heather Wallace, the project's senior
property manager. Wallace added that ob
taining permits and completing inspec
tions can take longer than expected. "But
most of the residents are really looking

forward to moving in."
Only people who are employed by the
University and working at least 30 hours a
week can apply for housing in Stanford
West. Carolyn Sargent, director of faculty
and staff housing, said the apartments will
help attract and keep new faculty.
"We certainly hope it will he an interim
housing option, and we've already had 40
or 50 new faculty apply," Sargent said.
Apartment leases will be negotiated annu
ally.
"We have wonderful amenities," Sar
gent said, pointing to each unit's large
windows, private deck or courtyard and
high-speed Internet connections. The
complex is also home to a completed club
house for meetings and social functions,
and a huge fitness facility.
Eighty percent of the first 60 units will
be filled by faculty, Wallace said, and the
remaining units will house staff members.
