# PA Chamber endorses land use plan
## Controversial General Use Permit picks up key local support 
### NICHOLAS CHAN 
Last week, the Palo Alto Chamber of Com
merce endorsed Stanford's controversial
Ceneral Use Permit and Community Plan.

A statement by the Chamber ol Com
merce cites three benefits of ihe plan, in
cluding 3,000 on-campus housing units to
"alleviate our local housing shortage and
[reduce] the net number of commute trips,"
2 million square feet of new athletic, ac ade
mic and cultural facilities "to remain com
petitive with other universities" and the pro
tection from development ol 2,090 acres in
the Foothill District and 300 acres on the
current Stanford campus.

In addition, the Chamber of Commerce's
statement affirms Stanford's support for
local schools and commitment to reducing
traffic.
"We appreciate the Chamber's sup
port," said Larry Horton, director of gov
ernment and community relations for the
University. "What they said is very well
thought out."
Currently, Stanford and the
Santa Clara County Planning
Commission are trying to reach
an agreement over the future ol
the Foothill and Lathrop Dis
tricts.
"The University's develop
ment process should not be
micro-managed by an outside
entity," Chamber of Commerce
President Charlotte Cagan told
the San Jose Mercury News.
On one side of this debate are
environmental groups like the
Stanford Open Space Alliance,
that wish to keep Stanford's un

developed lands as they are. Re
cently, access to the Foothill Dis
trict was restricted after 7 p.m.
On the same side are golfers
who wish to preserve the first
hole of the Stanford golf course,
which would be modified if con
struction begins.
On the other hand, many
people, including the Chamber
of Commerce, feel that the po
tential benefits of the land use
plan outweigh the environmen
tal impact.
The main difference between
Stanford's plan and Santa Clara
County's tentative plan is the
amount of time that each entity
wishes to protect 2,000 acres
bordering the campus. While
Stanford's decade-long agree

ment with the County only pro
tects the land in question for 10
years, the county's Board of Su
pervisors wants the land protect
ed for 25 years.
The Chamber of Commerce
said the Board of-Supervisors'
plan restricts growth in the
foothills for too long.
"The 10-year time line is
highly appropriate, considering
the rate of growth in the area,"
Cagan told the Mercury News.
Despite this difference, Santa
Clara County Supervisor Joe
Simitian said he feels that the
goals of the two groups have
"quite a bit of common ground,"
as both Stanford and the Board
of Supervisors wish to alleviate
traffic and housing problems

while preserving at least a por
tion of the Foothill and Lathrop
Districts.
At this point, Stanford's Gen
eral Use Permit and Community
Plan is at the third step in a five
step process. The first three
steps: drafting the plan, submit
ting the application and obtain
ing the county staffs unofficial
recommendation, have already
been completed.
The application must now be
reviewed by a planning commis
sion, which will announce its
final verdict on Oct. 19. The
final step will be the Oct. SI
meeting of the Hoard of Supervi
sors, where the Board will move
to accept or reject Stanford's
plan,
