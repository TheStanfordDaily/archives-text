# Hillel rabbi Kushner breaks new ground
## 
### HANNAH GOLDIE 
Stanford's newest rabbi is no
stranger to being treated like an
outsider. As one of about only
400 women rabbis in the world,
Noa Kushner, who came to the
Farm last fall, is used to breaking
ground in the traditionally male
realm of the rabbinate.
But in coming to Stanford,
she's also dealing with being on
a different kind of cultural fron
tier — the rather liberal West
Coast.
"I think that on some level,
Jewishly, the West Coast is still a
frontier, especially Northern
California," Kushner said about
her decision to come to Stanford
Hillel, the umbrella organiza
tion for all Jewish student activi
ties at Stanford. "It's not like the

Upper Wesi Side of New York
or Philadelphia."

Wo ni en
have only
been or
dained rabbis
since 1972,
and they're
still far from
common. At
Stan fo r d .
though, a
woman rabbi

seems to fit with the diversity en
couraged all over campus.
Despite the University's gen
eral aura ol" tolerance, Kushner
said she faces many challenges,
including rudeness, disbelief
and outright rejection as a rabbi.
Still, her rareness as a woman


Rabbi Kushner
rabbi is powerful, and she is mak
ing a noticeable impact on Jewish
life on campus.
Stanford lias a tradition of un
orthodox rabbis, so to speak. I he
last rabbi here, Yoel Kahn, was
"He also had a lot of things to
deal with," Kushner said. "But he's
also an older man with a mustache,
so people didn't respond to him
immediately."
People do seem to respond to
Kushner immediately, but some
times not in the way she wants.
"People's expectations of me
are very different because I'm not
a man, and I don't have a belly or
a big beard," said the youthful
Kushner, who stands about five
loot four inches tall.
"I gel a lot of 'is there another
rabbi?' or I have to repeat that I'm
the rabbi several times belbre it
sinks in, and that can be a little bit
discouraging."
Kushner wasn't always conscious
of the obstacles she would face.

"1 didn't reali/e how hard it was
going to be to be a woman rabbi,
because I was always traveling in
liberal religious circles," Kushner
said.
(irowing up in a family of rabbis
(her dad and uncle are rabbis),
Kushner always wanted to be in
volved.
"I grew up in an unusual con
gregation that was a combination
of left-wing politics and taking the
religious tradition very seriously,
so the two really went together,"
Kushner said of her roots in Sud
bury, Massachusetts, "ft was very
much about empowerment of the
people."
Kven with her family traditions,
it wasn't until she went to college at
Brown University I hat she decided
to become a rabbi.
" I started realizing that Judaism
wasn't tliis perfect universe — that
there were real cracks and holes
,nid places where women's experi
ences weren't counting," Kushner
said.
She began to explore gay and
lesbian issues, too.
"I thought, 'Well, 1 care enough
about Judaism to not throw it out
the window, and 1 care enough

about feminism and gay rights to
not throw those things out the win
dow. I lere 1 can make a marriage
and try to make a difference,' " she
said about her decision to become
a rabbi.
Here at Stanford, Kushner is
trying to begin to make that
difference.
"There are so many students
here, men and women, whose
image of what a Jew can be or a
rabbi can be is totally transformed
because I'm not those things and
they see me as someone who's
more like them instead of less like
them," Kushner said. "And that's
very powerful."
Dealing with the student body,
Kushner sees her uniqueness as a
blessing.
"I think it makes me better at
what I do here," she said.
Some students aren't so sure.
One student, a Conservative Jew
who didn't want to be identified
because he attends events at I fillel,
commented with an incredulous
tone about having a woman rabbi
at Stanford.
"She's not a rabbi," he said.
"Women just aren't rabbis."
Another student, who also

asked to remain anonymous, only
partly agreed.
"It's cool that Noa's a woman
involved in Judaism, and she's a
good teacher," he said. "But
sometimes it's hard to talk to her
when you've grown up with a
male rabbi."
Kushner isn't surprised by
these objections.
"The kinds of prejudices that
end up forming are very subtle.
It's not like people say, 'You can't
do this,' like they might have a
generation ago," she said.
Hut some students welcomed
the idea of a woman rabbi at Stan
ford and beyond.
"1 think it's a great thing for
the |ewish community, both at
Stanford and in general, for
there to be women rabbis," said
|essica Nusbaum, Class of 2000.
"I think that it is consistent with
trends in America today for there
to be professional gender equali
ty in religion just like in any
other field."
"She brings a lot more warmth
than the rabbi that was there last
year," junior Jonah Merger said.
"But she also has a sort of New
York female toughness to her, and

1 like that a lot."
Nusbaum explained that Hil
lel appears very traditional and
conservative, something that
can be intimidating and alienat
ing to students who want a less
intense involvement with the
organization.
"You have to be really rah-rah
Jewish to be involved, it seems,"
Nusbaum said. "There's no mid
dle ground."
Nusbaum cites this feeling as
the reason that she hasn't been in
volved. But she thinks that having
a female rabbi will help change this
perception.
"Having a male rabbi like in the
past reinforces that traditional
image," she said. "Having a fe
male rabbi helps to give a message
of openness and acceptance that is
very appealing."
Kushner finds that her age and
gender are indeed helpful in her
role at Hillel.
"By being someone who's al
most a peer, then 1 think it chal
lenges the students into something
they have to take more seriously.
Then they start to think, I bis isn't
just something my parents do,'
she said.

Kushner came to Stanford 1 lil
lel last fall to take on the role of a
campus spiritual leader, but what
she lias accomplished goes far be
yond what one would normally ex
pect of a rabbi.
Kushner has also been the dri
ving force behind weekly classes,
guest lectures and special presen
tations, according to Hayley DeL
ugach, last year's program direc
tor at Stanford Hillel.
"By bringing learning to the
forefront of what Hillel is doing,
we're integrating Jewish educa
tion into Jewish life here," DeLu
gacli said. "Noa's energy and vi
sion has really helped to shape this
idea, and she has encouraged and
inspired new ways to think about
Judaism and involve students all
over campus."
Kushner believes that she is
making a difference for the stu
dents, stall and community at
Stanford and beyond.
"I'm still a rabbi because of all of
those reasons," she said. "And then
also because 1 believe that there's
divine presence in the world and
that there's more to life than bas
ketball and sneakers and going to
movies."
