# Hillel rabbi Kushner breaks new ground
## 
### HANNAH GOLDIE 
Stanford's newest rabbi is no
stranger to being treated like an
outsider. As one of about only
400 women rabbis in the world,
Noa Kushner, who came to the
Farm last fall, is used to breaking
ground in the traditionally male
realm of the rabbinate.
But in coming to Stanford,
she's also dealing with being on
a different kind of cultural fron
tier â€” the rather liberal West
Coast.
"I think that on some level,
Jewishly, the West Coast is still a
frontier, especially Northern
California," Kushner said about
her decision to come to Stanford
Hillel, the umbrella organiza
tion for all Jewish student activi
ties at Stanford. "It's not like the

Upper Wesi Side of New York
or Philadelphia."

Wo ni en
have only
been or
dained rabbis
since 1972,
and they're
still far from
common. At
Stan fo r d .
though, a
woman rabbi

seems to fit with the diversity en
couraged all over campus.
Despite the University's gen
eral aura ol" tolerance, Kushner
said she faces many challenges,
including rudeness, disbelief
and outright rejection as a rabbi.
Still, her rareness as a woman
