1990
C )n September 28, 1990, The Daily pub
lished an article in which Stanford was
named as the Peninsula's No. 1 offender in
failing to reduce water use. Stanford re
ceived a $42,001) penalty for using more
water than ii was allotted.
"Statistics released by the San Jose Mer
cury News listed the University as using 13
percent more water in this drought-strick
en year than in 1987.
"Although conservation in some nearby
areas failed to meet targeted reductions,
the report showed Stanford as the only
community posting a net increase in water
use."
Norm Lougee, manager of resources
and planning at the San Francisco Water
Department, said that relations between
the University and the water department
remain good.
Bottom Line: Stanford without fountain hop
ping? A sad thought.
