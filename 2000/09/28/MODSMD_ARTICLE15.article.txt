A djiv after the industry released its
12-step plan to stop "inappropriately

is filled with loopholes," said Senate
Commerce Committee Chairman John
McCain, R-Ari/., who convened the
hearing ol eight top studio representa
tives.
Both the Democratic and Republican
presidential campaigns weighed in. urg
ing movie makers to take more ac tion.
"To put ii as blunth as I can, they
have not clone enough," said Democrat

Lieberman. "The\ would not say explic
itly that the;) would stop marketing
adult-rated products to our children."
Lynne Cheney, wife of COP vice
presidential candidate Dick Cheney,
took aim at both the industry and the

committee appearance two weeks ago
that movie executives had made mis
steps In showing R-rated movies to focus

down the table, asking 11it' industn
executives one by one whether iliev

Universal Studios Chairman Stac\

rated films we would take to a teen site."
Several others echoed her view.
"It is impossible to completely restrict
our ads for all those under 17." Snider
said.
Studio executives insisted that certain
R-rated films, like "Saving Private Rvan"
or "Amistad," are valuable I or mature
viewers under 17 to see. I he\ also
stressed that R does not bar children, it
only requires'them to be accompanied
