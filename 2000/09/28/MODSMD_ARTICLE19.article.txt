I would like to con t'd several errors
and misconceptions in I "lie Daily's edi
torial ol Sept. 27 on the Dish Conserva
tion and I se Plan.
1 he I niversily announced the Dish
plan m May. Ihe Daily supported the
plan in its May <S editorial. Since then,
the I Diversity has implemented the
plan exactly as it was announced and
lor the same reason: environmental
conservation.
I he plan to limit hikers to the exist
ing service road (that has alwavs been
paved and used by service vehicles),
enforce the long-neglected restrictions
on hours and ban dogs is "an enlight
ened and progressive step ... and
should be applauded," as The Daily
editorialized. Ihe Daily credited the
University with achieving an
"admirable" balance among "a plethora
of competing interests."
In addition, the charges ol "armed
guards" at the Dish are misleading. As
The Daily repotted May 3, Stanford
community service officers — who are
unarmed — would be posted at the
Dish to educate hikers about the rules
once the\ went into effect Sept. 1. 1 he
communit\ service officers have been
complimented lor the courtesy and
respect the) have shown visitors to the
area. Stanford sheriff's deputies, who
are armed, occasional!) patrol the Dish
area as they do all areas of campus.
Over the past month, we have
received dozens of comments in favor of
our efforts to minimize the impacts of
thousands of annual visitors lor the sake

of wildlife habitat and erosion preven
tion. I he repaved route provides a safe,
even surface for visitors. Deer sightings
have increased in the area and hikers
report more birds as well. Many people
have thanked tlie University for its
efforts to maintain public recreational
access to its private academic lands.
We urge students, faculty and staff to
visit and enjoy the recreational and
environmental improvements we have
made to the Dish area.

Angry runner seeks changes
to Foothills restrictions
I have been an avid jogger in the
beautiful Stanford Foothills for the past
two years, so when I came back to Stan
lord this autumn 1 was extreme!) dis
appointed to see that the many peace
invoking trails of the academic reserve
had been placed off limits.
If the c losure of these trails is intended
to protect the area from erosion and /ol
dest ruction of natural habitats, then I
urge the committee to share the statistics
wliic li have c aused it to act with such swili
determination. If those statistics clo indi
cate a need for restricted trail access, this
committee might consider a "limited
access" polic) rather than a "no excep
tions' restriction. If, on the other hand,
the closure of the trails is simply a mea
sure to restore what some claim is the
declining cosmetic condition of the
Foothills, then I exhort the committee to
fully repeal its policy.
Full appreciation ol the Stanford

Foothills is not realized Irom one's
carseat on the way home Irom work; the
richness that was the Foothills can only
he experienced on the trail. I he nnee
tnented trail, that is. I he hikers and jog
gers whose sources ol solace are the
mam tracks, trails, slopes and shadows ol
the St an lord foothills can <it test to this.

If \on once enjoyed the unrestrained
heaut) ol the* St an lord Foothills, please
do yonr part to let the decision-makers
know that yon are displeased with the
current policy. The different uses ol the
foothills are numerous, so I clo not
speak lot changes on behalf of dog
owners and company.

All I seek as a runner is the re-open
ing of ihe many secondary trails
throughout the academic reserve which
provide a solitude thai the main loop
does not provide.
