## Stanford looks to avenge sweep 
### EZRA CALLAHAN 
For most Stanford students,
the first weekend back at school
was a time of partying and cele
bration. For the women's volley
ball team, the first weekend back
on the Farm was nothing short of
a nightmare.
Consecutive 3-0 loses to No. 4
USC and No. 5 UCLA this past
weekend marred the Cardinal's
homecoming and brought the
team's 45-malch home winning
streak to a sudden end. The two
sweeps also mark the first time
Stanford has lost consecutive Pa
cific 10 matches at Maples.
This was hardly how Interim
Head Coach Denise Corlett envi
sioned her team's first home
games.
The Cardinal (7-4, 2-2 Pac-10)
fell four spots, to No. 15, in the lat
est USA Today/AVCA poll. The
team must recover tjuic kl\- as it
heads to Arizona this weekend,
with conference matches Friday
against No. <8 Arizona (10-1, 3-0)
and Saturday against Arizona
State (10-3, 2-1).
A quick recovery might be
tough for the Cardinal. Corlett
called Friday's 15-4, 15-8, 15-2 de
feat to the Trojans "one of the
most embarrassing matches in the
program's history." Stanford only
posted 25 kills to the Trojan's 38,
and put up a .000 attack percent
age for the match.
Though UCLA also handily
beat the Cardinal, Saturday's 15-
11, 15-2, 15-11 loss to the Bruins

did give Corlett some reasons to
hope. Senior Jennier Detmer had
12 kills, and the Cardinal attack
was much strongei, with the team
hitting .281 for the match.
The match marked Detmer's
first start this seaso.i for the Cardi
nal. Alter missing much of the
early part of the season, tlie two
time All-Pac-10 mddle blocker is
beginning to turn jut tlie kind of
numbers that earned her such
awards.
"Detmer is ore of the best
blockers in the country when she's
healthy," said Corlett. "Having
her back playing well will definite
ly bring us some of the consistency
we need."
Such consistency has evaded
Stanford so lar this season. Alter
being upset In EYU and Utah
early in the season, Stanford post
ed only narrow victories over ()re
gon and Oregon Slate to open
conference play two weeks ago.
"We have as much, maybe
more, talent than (USC and
l'CL\)." said Corlett. "Our prob
lem has been that we aren't click
ing as a unit. We are li ving to find
a group that does.'
The search for Mich a group led
to freshmen Sara Dukes and Sara
McCee getting their lit si chances
to start on Saturday against
UCIA, and both looked impres
sive. Dukes had nine kills, while
McCiee posted seven kills, hitting a
team-best .538. Both are expected
to start this weekend in Arizona.
While Stanford has struggled
with consistent and identity

problems, their opponents for the
weekend have been playing some
of their best volleyball.
On Fridax Stanlord will lact
one of the hottest teams in the
country, the Arizona Wildcats in
Tucson. 1 he No. H Wildcats have
won 10 in a tow and have not
dropped a single game .n home
yet this season.

With a lot of pride on the line,
the Wildcats will be waiting to
pounce all over the (Cardinal after
last week's defeats. A win for Ari
zona on Frida\ would give the
program its longest winning
streak ever and mark its lirst victo
rv over Stanford since 1993.

matches against the Trojans and No. 5 UCLA.
Arizona lias been packing
quite a punch out on ihe court

leads the Pac-10.
On Saturday, the Cardinal will
travel to lempe to take on Ari

ils don't look as impressive on

reason to take them just as seri
ously as their in-state rival. Ari
zona State has won nine of its last
10.
Arizona State is lead by senior
standout Amanda Burbridge,
whose 219 kills on the season
places her second in the Pac-10,
behind only I CIA star Kristee

her as one of the best all-around
players in the conference.
With the overall strength of
the Pac-10 this season, the Car

The match marked Detmer's
first start this seaso.i for the Cardi
nal. Alter missing much of the
early part of the season, tlie two
time All-Pac-10 mddle blocker is
beginning to turn jut tlie kind of
numbers that earned her such
awards.
"Detmer is ore of the best
blockers in the country when she's
healthy," said Corlett. "Having
her back playing well will definite
ly bring us some of the consistency
we need."
Such consistency has evaded
Stanford so lar this season. Alter
being upset In EYU and Utah
early in the season, Stanford post
ed only narrow victories over ()re
gon and Oregon Slate to open
conference play two weeks ago.
"We have as much, maybe
more, talent than (USC and
l'CL\)." said Corlett. "Our prob
lem has been that we aren't click
ing as a unit. We are li ving to find
a group that does.'
The search for Mich a group led
to freshmen Sara Dukes and Sara
McCee getting their lit si chances
to start on Saturday against
UCIA, and both looked impres
sive. Dukes had nine kills, while
McCiee posted seven kills, hitting a
team-best .538. Both are expected
to start this weekend in Arizona.
While Stanford has struggled
with consistent and identity

problems, their opponents for the
weekend have been playing some
of their best volleyball.
On Fridax Stanlord will lact
one of the hottest teams in the
country, the Arizona Wildcats in
Tucson. 1 he No. H Wildcats have
won 10 in a tow and have not
dropped a single game .n home
yet this season.

With a lot of pride on the line,
the Wildcats will be waiting to
pounce all over the (Cardinal after
last week's defeats. A win for Ari
zona on Frida\ would give the
program its longest winning
streak ever and mark its lirst victo
rv over Stanford since 1993.

Junior outside hitter Sara Sandrick, shown here in action last weekend
against No. 4 USC, and the Cardinal look to rebound from last weekend's
pair of home losses. Sandrick collected 10 kills and 10 errors in the two
matches against the Trojans and No. 5 UCLA.
Arizona lias been packing
quite a punch out on ihe court
early in ihe season. 1 lie team is
hitting .359 and averaging more
than IS kills a game to lead the
conference.
1 he Wildcats offensive tury
has been led by All-Pac-10 senior
Marisa DaLee, who has ham
mered away at opponents with
:'>.9 kills per game and a confer
ence-leading .492 attack per
centage. Also leading the Ari
zona attack has been junior
Dana Burkholder, whose 14.1
assists-pcr-game average also
leads the Pac-10.
On Saturday, the Cardinal will
travel to lempe to take on Ari
zona State. Although the Sun Dev
ils don't look as impressive on
paper as Arizona, the (Cardinal lias

reason to take them just as seri
ously as their in-state rival. Ari
zona State has won nine of its last
10.
Arizona State is lead by senior
standout Amanda Burbridge,
whose 219 kills on the season
places her second in the Pac-10,
behind only I CIA star Kristee
Porter. Burbridge's 4.05 digs per
game lead the Pac-10, establishing
her as one of the best all-around
players in the conference.
With the overall strength of
the Pac-10 this season, the Car
dinal must play well this week
end aftei picking up two early
conference losses. Stanford is al
ready in jeopardy ol falling out
of ((intention for the conference
title, but Corlett is not yet too
concerned.
Corlett said, "Von can't be on
top all of the time, but we have a
lot of people that want to be on top
and want to carry on the Stanford
legacy."
