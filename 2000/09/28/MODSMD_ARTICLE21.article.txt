# Gardner's feat no Mickey Mouse affair

This was intended to be a column
about Stanford in Sydney: the Unit
ed States' women's volleyball team
gunning for gold, or perhaps about
Mistv Hyman's record-breaking race, or the
stable of Cardinal distance runners readying
themselves for the world stage at last.
But then Rulon Gardner had to go and pull
the greatest Olympic upset in 20 years and
turn the wrestling world on its ear.
Gardner, barely known in his native U.S.
before these Games began, outlasted the
greatest Greco-Roman wrestler of all time, the
near-mythical Russian Aleksandr Karelin, 1-0
in the super-heavyweight finals Thursday. In
doing so, he claimed the one gold medal in
these Games many thought was already in
scribed.
It was the sort of matchup ih.u makes you

suspect you thai Disney ex
ecutives really do run the
Olympics. Karelin had
never lost in international
competition. Never. Heck,
no one had even scored a
point against him in 10
years, which is roughly like a
major league pitcher spin
ning a no-hitter for about
three hundred innings.

1 le was the Russian giant — 0-3 1/4,2<52 lbs.
— sprung fully-formed from the Siberian
lorests, before whom several international
champions had literally rolled over and (|tiii
just to escape embarrassment.
And Gardner? Just a Nebraska larmboy,
late ol the Gornhuskers wrestling team, who
finished fifth in the 1997 world champi

unships and had never sei loot on another in
ternational mat.
He'd wrestled Karelin before, at those
championships, and Karelin had trounced
him, 5-0, throwing Gardner's 28") lbs. through
the an like a giant, sweaty Frisbee.
Gardner couldn't even get any respect at
home; he's long played second fiddle to two
time ()lympian Matt (ihallari. a storied super
heavyweight in his own tight.
Even after beating GhaHari senseless in the
Olympic trials to secure his berth this year,
Gardner waited patiently lor the TV crews
and commentators to finish talking to his ad
versary, dissecting his loss, before belatedly
shuffling over to Gardner's quietly victorious
corner.
