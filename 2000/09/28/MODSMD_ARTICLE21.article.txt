# Gardner's feat no Mickey Mouse affair
## 
### 
This was intended to be a column
about Stanford in Sydney: the Unit
ed States' women's volleyball team
gunning for gold, or perhaps about
Mistv Hyman's record-breaking race, or the
stable of Cardinal distance runners readying
themselves for the world stage at last.
But then Rulon Gardner had to go and pull
the greatest Olympic upset in 20 years and
turn the wrestling world on its ear.
Gardner, barely known in his native U.S.
before these Games began, outlasted the
greatest Greco-Roman wrestler of all time, the
near-mythical Russian Aleksandr Karelin, 1-0
in the super-heavyweight finals Thursday. In
doing so, he claimed the one gold medal in
these Games many thought was already in
scribed.
It was the sort of matchup ih.u makes you

suspect you thai Disney ex
ecutives really do run the
Olympics. Karelin had
never lost in international
competition. Never. Heck,
no one had even scored a
point against him in 10
years, which is roughly like a
major league pitcher spin
ning a no-hitter for about
three hundred innings.

1 le was the Russian giant — 0-3 1/4,2<52 lbs.
— sprung fully-formed from the Siberian
lorests, before whom several international
champions had literally rolled over and (|tiii
just to escape embarrassment.
And Gardner? Just a Nebraska larmboy,
late ol the Gornhuskers wrestling team, who
finished fifth in the 1997 world champi

unships and had never sei loot on another in
ternational mat.
He'd wrestled Karelin before, at those
championships, and Karelin had trounced
him, 5-0, throwing Gardner's 28") lbs. through
the an like a giant, sweaty Frisbee.
Gardner couldn't even get any respect at
home; he's long played second fiddle to two
time ()lympian Matt (ihallari. a storied super
heavyweight in his own tight.
Even after beating GhaHari senseless in the
Olympic trials to secure his berth this year,
Gardner waited patiently lor the TV crews
and commentators to finish talking to his ad
versary, dissecting his loss, before belatedly
shuffling over to Gardner's quietly victorious
corner.


Jeff Cooper
The whole match smacked of
absurdist performance art, like a
crazed Sylvester Stallone fan in
tent on bringing Rocky IV to life,
112 lenry Kissinger was there, for
God's sake. Trouble was, Karelin
was playing both parts — the
body of Ivan Drago, with all the
heart and class of the boy from
Philly.
Aleksandr the Great,' they call
him. Anyone in the sport will tell
you he's the best ever. They love
him so much in Russia they made
him a member of the Duma, the
Russian parliament.
He even has his own throw
named after him, an over-the
back toss popular in lighter weight
( lasses but impossible at the super
heavyweight level for almost any

one but Karelin himself.
Juan Antonio Samarach, the
International Olympic Commit
tee president, was in the audience
to coronate Karelin with the gold;
only three men in history had
four straight gold medals in a sin
gle event before (Carl Lewis in
long jump, A1 Oerter in discus
and Paul Elvstrom in dinghy sail
ing). Karelin was to be the fourth.
Beat this man, this literal
Olympian? Are you kidding?
Standing next to him during
introductions, Gardner looked
like a teddy bear. He figured he'd
be lucky to make it out with all his
organs intact.
And then the match started,
and any Disney executive can tell
you how it went from there.
Gardner just wouldn't let him
self get tossed. He struggled and
butted and fought off Karelin's at
tempts and scored the first point
of the match to start the second

period when he broke Karelin's
grip from a clinch position.
It was the first point against
Karelin in 10 years, and the first
time he'd been behind in a match
in 13. The crowd didn't know
whether to cheer or to gasp. It was
like watching a man fly by flap
ping his arms — great for him,
but it means something's awry
with reality.
From that moment, Karelin
and Gardner struggled mightily.
Gardner had an answer for
every Karelin grab over the next
few minutes. Time ran out, and
there it was, 20 years after the
Miracle on Ice — the Miracle on
the Mat.
What's glorious and terrible
about the Miracle this time
around, of course, is that it's 20
years later. There's no evil empire
to gloat over, no bungling com
mies to caricature.
Just a giant and a farmboy.

Harder to chant "U-S-A" this time
around, perhaps, when the great
est ever had to bow his head in de
feat.
Yet the purity of this match
made it equally as memorable.
One man stepping out of the
shadows and another standing in
them for the first time in his life.
That's why they play the Games.
Karelin left quickly, without
saying much to anybody, as he al
ways does, win or lose. The Asso
ciated Press reporter asked Gard
ner when he thought he'd win the
match.
"About 10 minutes ago," Gard
ner said, 10 minutes after the
match. "It wasn't until it was over
that I knew I could."
Out of the shadows at last for
Gardner and into the history
books.
Disney executives may be run
ning the show, but at least they do
a hell of a job.

named after him, an over-the
back toss popular in lighter weight
( lasses but impossible at the super
heavyweight level for almost any

one but Karelin himself.
Juan Antonio Samarach, the
International Olympic Commit
tee president, was in the audience
to coronate Karelin with the gold;
only three men in history had
four straight gold medals in a sin
gle event before (Carl Lewis in
long jump, A1 Oerter in discus
and Paul Elvstrom in dinghy sail
ing). Karelin was to be the fourth.
Beat this man, this literal
Olympian? Are you kidding?
Standing next to him during
introductions, Gardner looked
like a teddy bear. He figured he'd
be lucky to make it out with all his
organs intact.
And then the match started,
and any Disney executive can tell
you how it went from there.
Gardner just wouldn't let him
self get tossed. He struggled and
butted and fought off Karelin's at
tempts and scored the first point
of the match to start the second

period when he broke Karelin's
grip from a clinch position.
It was the first point against
Karelin in 10 years, and the first
time he'd been behind in a match
in 13. The crowd didn't know
whether to cheer or to gasp. It was
like watching a man fly by flap
ping his arms — great for him,
but it means something's awry
with reality.
From that moment, Karelin
and Gardner struggled mightily.
Gardner had an answer for
every Karelin grab over the next
few minutes. Time ran out, and
there it was, 20 years after the
Miracle on Ice — the Miracle on
the Mat.
What's glorious and terrible
about the Miracle this time
around, of course, is that it's 20
years later. There's no evil empire
to gloat over, no bungling com
mies to caricature.
Just a giant and a farmboy.

Harder to chant "U-S-A" this time
around, perhaps, when the great
est ever had to bow his head in de
feat.
Yet the purity of this match
made it equally as memorable.
One man stepping out of the
shadows and another standing in
them for the first time in his life.
That's why they play the Games.
Karelin left quickly, without
saying much to anybody, as he al
ways does, win or lose. The Asso
ciated Press reporter asked Gard
ner when he thought he'd win the
match.
"About 10 minutes ago," Gard
ner said, 10 minutes after the
match. "It wasn't until it was over
that I knew I could."
Out of the shadows at last for
Gardner and into the history
books.
Disney executives may be run
ning the show, but at least they do
a hell of a job.
