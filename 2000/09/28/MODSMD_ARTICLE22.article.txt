### BEN ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
If the No. 2 Stanford men appear to be
sauntering toward the finish line at Satur
day's 27ili annual Stanford Invitational in
stead of making their usual charge, you'll
have to excuse them.
It's not that the guys won't be giving
their all fora Stanford victory â€” though
with this year's weaker-than-usual field of
teams, a 90 percent effort from the Cardi
nal could conceivably take the title.
But with the team gearing up all week to
watch two current Cardinal harriers in the
men's 1,500-meter final on Friday night's
tape-delayed Olympic telecast, the usually
stellar running at the Invitational could
sink to the rank of afterthought.
Senior Michael Stember and junior
Gabe Jennings, representing a solid chunk
of Stanford's distance talent, were expect
ed to run in the 1,500 meters final in Syd
ney representing the United States.
However, both finished ninth in their
semifinal heats and failed to qualify for the

final, potentially rendering their team
mates' spirits low.
Though Stember has made his big mark
on the track while treading lightly on the
t ross country trails, Jennings took the In
vitation,il's individual title in 199 Hand led
the race briefly last year before fading to
18th.
The (Cardinal will hardly miss these two,
however, when Saturday's starting pistol
fires.
Stanford is likely to be led by senior
Thomas Murley, junior Jamey (iiflord and
a host of sophomores including Seth
Hejny and Adam Tenforde.
The men will be divided between two
races, the Collegiate section (4:45 pm) and
the higher profile Championship Invita
tional (5:20 p.m.). Unranked UCLA is the
lone Pacific 10 Conference presence other
than the Cardinal in the Championship
section against a field that includes teams
like Kansas State and Utah State.
The Collegiate section will offer a
