# Plugged In:
## Bridging the digital divide 
### UDARA FERNANDO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Palo Alto, adjacent to Stanford
and the home of many start-up mil
lionaires, has some of the most ex
pensive commercial real estate in
the nation. Nearby Silicon Valley is
the liilcrum of the Internet era and
the high-tech capital of the world.
East Palo Alto, on the other
hand, paints a very different pic
ture. Its residents struggle against
high unemployment rates and low
wages, all the while laced with the al
fluence of neighboring Palo Alto.
The contrast between these two
communities is so great that Presi
dent Bill Clinton chose East Palo
Alto to kick off a two-day trip last
April spotlighting the "digital di
vide" — the split between those who
have computers and Internet ac
cess, and those who do not.
Plugged In, a technology center
in the heart of East Palo Alto, aims to
close the gap. ()perating since 1992,
the organization's mission is to en
sure that everyone in East Palo Alto
has the opportunity to fully benefit
from all that the information revo
lution has to offer.
Bart Decrum, the founder of
Plugged In, was volunteering at the
Boys and Cirls Club of Palo Alto
when he got the idea for the organi
zation. Decrum saw the need to
make technology more accessible to
teenagers in Palo Alto, especially
around the notoriously alcohol-sat
urated — and recently demolished
— Whiskey Gulch area.
Building on this idea, Decrum
and several others set up a center,
where kids could learn how to use
computers. Plugged In Enterprises,
now just one of several programs
run by Plugged In, evolved from
this center.
Now, Plugged In Enterprises
trains teenagers in the latest Web
design technology. Teenagers use
their skills to operate a Web design
business that creates Web sites for
community members and paying
commercial clients. Clients of the
Enterprises include Pacific Bell and

Sun Microsystems.
Other wings of Plugged In are
Plugged In (Ireenhouse, A la Mode
and the lechnology Access(-enter.
Plugged In Greenhouse is a cre
ative arts and technology studio for
EPA children at the elementary
school level. The project includes a
variety of after-school activities,
classroom partnerships and spec ial
projects based on educational
themes.
A la Mode, a recent addition to
Plugged In, is a graphic design en
terprise targeted at junior-high to
high-school students. Teenagers
participating in the program re
ceive about a month of training
using graphics software and learn
ing alxuit different types of visual
design. After the training session,
they Ix'giu working on projects for
businesses around the community.
Bobby Baird, a recent Stanford
Human Biology graduate, is the
manager of the A la Mode program.

Brown started as a volunteer at
Plugged In during his years at Stan
ford, and applied fora full-time po
sition at the organization in March.
Baird noted that, since the pro
gram is still in its infancy, stability
continues lobe its main goal. "Some
things that we're aiming for include
a consistent group of 10 to I I kids to
work with, regular tutorial training
sessions with graphic design profes
sionals, as well as a more regular
client list," he said.
David Huang, a senior, volun
teered at A la Mode this summer. "I
got interested in Plugged In when I
met the founder, Bart Decrum, at
the Social Entrepreneurship Con
ference sponsored by BASES and
Kids with Dreams last year," he said.
"I decided to drive over there are
take look, to see what it was like."
After meeting the dynamic staff of
Plugged In, Huang was hooked.
"Interacting with the kids was
the Ixst experience," I luang said of

his work with the A la Mode project.
"Throwing ideas around, helping
them learn these advanced ideas, to
use the Internet and graphic design
programs to actually c reate some
thing that they can be proud of— it
was a realh fulfilling experience."
Plugged Ins location is a major
factor in its success. "Being so
dose to Silicon Valley, there are
incredible opportunities for kids
to stay at the cutting edge,' said
Florencia Zubertino, operations
manager at Plugged In. "They
can stay connected, stay in touch
with all the trends that are going
on 111 the Valley."
To actively encourage people to
slay on the cut ting edge. Plugged In
gives young employees an increase
in hourly wages based not only on
the length of their affiliation with
the organization but on how many
new software applications they have
mastered.
The Technology Access Center,
the more adult-oriented compo
nent of Plugged In, is described as a
"community production studio,
copy center, cyber'-library, self
paced learning studio and telecom
munication booth for East Palo
Alto." The Technology Access Cen
ter provides one-on-one assistance
for people to ac hieve their individ
ual goals, with special resources for
those seeking jobs, health-related
information, homework assistance
or web design information.
Community members get access
to these facilities by either paying a
small fee on a daily or mc >nthly basis,
or, alternatively, volunteering at the
center fora certain number of
hours.
Zubertino stressed that Plugged
In is more than a tech haven.
"Plugged In doesn't just want to be
a photocopying place, hut a place to
hang out, meet friends, seek Ixtter
opportunities — a community
hub," she said.
"One of the key successes of
Plugged In is that it is run by the
pec>ple, and they have scime sense <>112
