# Athlete's DNA in merchandise
## 
### GUHA JAYACHANDRAN 
The I)NA of one Aus
tralian athlete is <>11 all oflic ial
Olympic merchandise being
sold. I ar from being cause
fora recall, the DNA's pres
ence is intentional and de
signed to serve a difficult
role: a mark ol authenticity.
Official merchandise sales
for this year's Olympics are
expected to reach around
$.")() million, with counterfeit
ers also seeking to grab a
large take. Searching lor a
weapon to help st 1 lie illicit
merchandisers, organi/ers in
1990 elected to turn to a new
technology. Where, in the
1996 Atlanta (lames, goods
were marked with holo
grams, all official Sydney
merchandise, from caps to
mugs, are marked with a
"DNA ink."
The ink. developed by
DNA Technologies ot Los
Angeles, is visible- only to a
special, handheld scannei
and contains a subtle secret:
a chemical mixture that is
partially based-on the DNA
of an undisclosed Australian
athlete.
DNA was taken from a
saliva swab from the athlete,
replicated, and mixed with
certain proteins and en
zymes. Onh three people
know wlutkathlete the saliva
was taken from, and ()lympic
officials have said that the
athlete may not even he a
current competitor*?'"' t â€ž
Even if would-be counter
feiters discovered the human
source, they would still face
the daunting task of deter
mining what segment of the
'athlete's approximately
three-billion-base-pair large
genome was included.

And even if this obstacle is
surmounted, counterfeiters
would have to reverse-engi
neer the ink, which is being
made at an undisclosed lot a
tion, and figure out whereon
each type of merchandise the
ink is placed.
Chris Outwater, CEO ol
DNA Technologies, portrays
the power his company's
product this way: "Say you're
standing in front of the New
York Public Library and you
confront a counterfeiter
looking fora clue. You say:
'I've taken one sentence from
one book in that library. Now
you find it. "
According to DNA Tech
nologies, its ink is less repro
ducible, and therefore more
effective, than holograms. At
a total cost of about five cents
an item, it is cheaper, too.
Though the Olympics
have witnessed the largest
scale application of DNA ink
authentication to date, the
technology has been used be
fore. Most notably, in 1998,
professional baseball player
Mark McGwire's record
breaking 7()ih home run ball
was marked by a DNA c ode.
The authentication tech
nique was also used on equip
ment from Warner Brothers'
"Batman" and "Wild, Wild
West, assuring potential col
lectors of their purchase's
value. Tn the realm of art,
Thomas Kinkade has used
DNA authentication on his
works.
Applications of DNA tech
nology is spreading. Right
now. though, sellers of offi
cial Sydney merchandise
hope that their DNA weapon
will help them win gold in
t heir ()lympic contest against
losses from counterfeiting.
