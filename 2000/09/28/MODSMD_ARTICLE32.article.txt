### SALAS SARAIYA EDITORIAL STAFF 
This is the second in a series of Innovation humor
columns foreseeing a future with technology gone
awry. The inspiration for the column comes from
"The future doesn 't need us," a Wired article by
Hill Jov, chief scientist of Sun Microsystems.

Microsoft was once sued Ibi becoming too
big and powerful. ()1 course, the mere thought
ol .i compam built on software and operating
systems seems laughable nowadays.
I he olfice of the last profitable software
company. Waiters for A Complete Kaleido
scope, shut down yesterday. WA( l\ < hairman
Slim) Sam said. "We were the No. 1 porn site
on the Internet. And it doesn't even matter: we
can't turn .1 profit. All our pictures show up in
slant I \ on these blasted file-sharing programs,
.ind we stand here powerless to stop the inva
sion. I leel so used, so violated."
Sam continued, "Back in the- da\, A( )L, Mi

crosolt and Yahoo! were thought <>l «is forward
thinkers. Jerry Yang was a folk hero. People
were waiting for the dav Ama/on would turn a
profit."
Sadl\ lor popular (l.() Jeff Be/.os, that day
never came.
Often it is those with short but lien lives
that light ,i spark in the nation's conscious
ness. Marilyn Monroe and Hlvis Presley im
mediately jump to mind. As does Napster.
I he music-sharing program founded in \la\
1999 was shut down less than two years later
after vicious legal battles against such media
giant>> as the Recording Inclustn Association
of America and Metallica.
Napster was one ol the first hugely success
ful large-scale implementation ol the peer-to
peei model of computing. Before Napster,
peer-to-peei computing was reserved mosth
lot small workgroups, whereas the client-serv
er model was used lot larger implementations.
I lie client-server model of computing in
cludes a dedicated server and (lients that rcl\
on the server lor resources such as network

connectivity, file sharing and printing. Appli
cations were run on the client computers,
which accessed the server for needed re
sources. In the peer-to-peer model, however,
each workstation is self-sufficient and has
equivalent responsiblities.
Though Napster was praised for its use of
the peer-to-peer model, its Achilles heel was
its centralization. The servers that housed
Napster.com and connected people on the
Internet wishing to swap copyrighted MP.'i
music were easy targets lor music companies
and artists upset about their disappearing
royalties.
()ther companies, such as (inutella, found
ed in 2000. and MistyWinky, founded in 2004,
picked 1 11 > the slack. I heir software allowed
people to connect direct 1\ to other's comput
ers by entering I heir 11' addresses with no cen
tral server acting as a middleman.
I lie music industry's attempts to compile a
Metallic a-like list and file a reverse class action
suit against all users of musk-sharing pro
grams stalled when many high ranking music
officials were found to be on that list.
I he now famous denial bv Bigsalsa (lorpo
ration president Bin Million,"I did not have
musical relations with that tile-sharing pro
gram, MistvWinkv," struck a dull chord with
the American people, who were sick of the lies.
While many artists claim to make music for
the sheer enjoyment and not tor the capital
gains, most left the music inclusirv due to the
decline in royalties following the victor) of the
computer industry.
()n l-'ebruan {), 2000, the fiftieth anniver
sar) ol the da\ the da\ Budch I lolly, Ritchie
\ .ilens ,mtl |.l\ Richardson died on a plane
crash in lowa, there was no music created. I lie
second "Day the Music Died" did not last long,
however.
The next day.the Leland Stanford junior
I niveisity Marching Band awoke from its
drunken stupor. I heir loud and exuberant
nill sit tilled thccountrv with jov and beer until
Stanford Professor Hell K. Dee created a neu
lological network c apable of creating creative
music.
Since the recording industry's legal defeat,
file-sharing programs have become übiqui
tous. Whereas tliev once housed only music,
now the programs boast large databases of
music, software, movies and, of course,
pornography.
