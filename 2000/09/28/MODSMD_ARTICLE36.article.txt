# Exploring the city neighborhood by neighborhood
## Breaking out of the bubble 
### ENO SARRIS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Welcome back, everybody, to the
Stanford Experience. Welcome
back to Residential Education's
"House Activities." Welcome to
dorm trips to football games, wel
come to "Screw Your Roommate"
dances.
Welcome to lines for dirty hall
ways. Welcome to your cubicle of a
room; welcome to your modular
furniture. Hope you like your cafe
teria food, and that you don't lose
that "Freshman 15" on the all-cere
al diet, Good luck making your way

through the maze that is ()ld Union
while being sent from the Financial
Aid Office to the Bursar's Office â€”
and back.
(iood luck figuring your life out
before that "end of sophomore year,
declare-your-future" deadline.
Good luck trying to graduate sane.
Especially without dorm funds for
alcohol. Or the Foothills, even.
One piece of advice might actual
ly help in the sanity retention de
partment: go to San Francisco. And
go often.
Fhe bubble that Stanford Uni
versity creates to protect both its stu
dents and its own intei ests threatens
to keep you on campus. Taking cars

away from freshmen is merely a tac
tic in this war for your personality.
You must break their bubble and
light back by any means necessary,
as your individuality depends on it.
You don't really want to end up ex
actly like your Wilbur Hall neigh
bor, do you? And Galtrain really
isn't that bad.
The city, replete with crime and
dirtiness, offers so much. From
"Dykes on Bikes" to "dot-com-ers"
in black, the various San Francis
cans have set up some incredible
neighborhoods to fit their lifestyles.
Our proximity to these wonderfully
diverse regions mandates that we
take advantage of the opportunity.
