# Haight Street
## 
### 
1 laight Street itself is a gtxxl example of the city's incredible diversity.
The distance from Haight-Ashbury to 1 laight-Fillmore is much more
than the ten blocks that separate the two.
At the corner of Haight Street and Ashbury Street, at 710 Ashbury,
stands The Grateful Dead House. The house, although not too unique,
was the at the heart of the social revolution that was the 19605. Unfortu
nately, much of the genuine I lippie flavor has gone out of 1 laight-Ash
bury since the days when Pigpen prowled the corner with his buddy
Jerry.
for example, The Gap now owns a store that looms over the infamous

timer. Backless I -shirts for every
one!
)usi because corporate America
is nosing in on the area doesn't
mean there isn't anything cool to do
that hasn't been "Mainstreamed"
vet.
Try the Buffalo Exchange for ac
tual used clothing instead of sweat
shop-produced, used-looking, pre
washed pieces of crap. And Amoe
ba Music is very, very bad for your
wallet. Setting a limit on how many
compact discs you will buy — and
then actually sticking to that limit —
may be a good idea. Your credit rat
ing will thank you. Same goes for
Housewares if you are a House
music fan.
For your viewing pleasure. The
Red Vic Moviehouse shows ofF-the
beaten-track movies that wouldn't
ever make the Sunday Flicks line
up. Alter "Imagine Surfing as Sad
liana" this weekend, the Vic pre
sents "Groove," the story of the
early San Francisco rave scene, next
weekend.
The highlight of the dining
scene may be Kan Zaman, a mid
dle-eastern eatery th.it features
belly dancing and feast-like courses.
At t lie end of your meal, you are en
couraged to light up the hookahs
and pull On some flavored tobacco.
Encouraged. Also, try Fat Slice fora
three dollar meal. The pizza slices
are big, fluffy and filling.
Go .1 couple blocks south,
though, and everything changes
(other than the more-than-slight
buildup of grime in the streets).
There are drug dealers in the
1 laight-Fillmore area but about as
mam piercings. While the Upper
I (.light features more shopping,
down hv Fillmore the bars rule.
Mad Dog in the Fog is a fun, al
most-English, almost sorter pub.
In the earlv evenings, soccer fans
congregate to veil at the three tele
visions in the front room. Eater, so
< i.ilites gather to have loud cover
bands veil .it them in the back room.
Fhe l op, even with its cover
charge, is a must loi electronic;!
I.ins. I louse fans .it least will appre
ciate the main I)|s that grace the
I I.iight bar.
Axum ('.ale is the diamond in the
rough of I laight-Fillmore. Fhe
Ethiopian cale has good fixxl, at a
good price, though the selection is
sparse. And it's always fun to watt h
vour date attempt to keep good
manners while eating without uten
sils. Squat 'N' Gobble is a more
than-decent breakfast crepery with
original breakfasts worth trying.
Repeatedly.
As for shows, go to the Fillmore,
which in the 'b()s was the heaviest of
the heavy hitters. It recently re
opened and boasts one of the best
lineups in the city, day in and day
out. Going to a show in their ball
room, with its towering ceilings and
grand chandeliers, is a must.
