# The 						Castro
## 
### 
West of Dolores Park is where the wild
things roam. The Castro neighborhood is
where leather is rampant and hiker is the style.
But don't let those spikes scare you.
So: Go to the Castro. At least during Hal
loween, when you can meet good people
dressed as c razy things. Yon might open your
mind to worlds beyond your own. You might
get a nipple ring.
The fact that the neighborhood has become
home to a tight-knit gay population shouldn't
keep you away. They do have normal needs
and desires that will lall in line with your own.
Like Harvest Ranch Market, where the soup
and salad buffet is as huge as the whole foods
selection. Or Just Desserts, which you could
claim was just a dessert place. Until you had the
Mocha Butter Cream Cake and changed your
mind.
The Castro also features, like most other
neighborhoods in San Francis
co, a good all night diner.
Sparky's might make you feel
lucky not to be the guy next to
you, but at least you can get two
eggs over easy at three in the
morning.
And, of course, there are
straight bars in the area. Lucky
13 has a cool Lou Reed-ish at
mosphere going and next door,
at Cafe du Nord, you can revel in
jazz, high prices and an upscale
clientele.
Thai House has the best Thai
food in the area and is nestled in
the mostly residential neighbor
hood at the end of Noe street.
Nippon Sushi, also known as No
Name Sushi, is damn good.
The Castro Theater is
renowned for showing movies
that no one else will show. Take
that as you will.
But if gay bars and eateries is
what you're looking for, no one
will be able to stop you. One of
(lie better themed eateries is I lot
n' I funky, where you can order
an "I want to hold your ham"
sandwich.. There's also The
Sausage Factor) where you can
go if you crave a good sausage.
C)r pizza. Or man.
The Cale is a great bar where
everyone is smiling and the
dancing is exuberant. Don't go if
you are claustrophobic, though.
Or homophobic. Other good
stops are Fhe Mint and Twin
Peaks. At Fhe Mint, you can join
in the karaoke and sing "Like a
Virgin." Come on, do it. You
onl\ live once, von know.
