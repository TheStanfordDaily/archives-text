# North Beach
## 
### 
The easiest way to locate North
Beach is by its largest landmark, that
hose-looking nozzle called Coit
Tower. As lor having an enlightening
cultural experience, there's not much
(o the monument to firefighters other
than the view. But it's pretty durned
tall.
Washington Square Park holds
more potential for an enlightening ex
perience. The throngs practicing Tai-
Chi in the early morning mist seem
somewhere between mystical and
eerie in the dawn. Their pace and
precision are perfect lor the early
morning, and the people still sleeping
on the benches merely add to the
scene.
Perhaps it was moments like these
that made the neighborhood popular
among the Beat Writers. Their pres-

encecan still be felt along the streets
that sometimes bear their names,
like jack Kerouac Alley. City Lights
Bookstore still has the same eccen
tric selection of books it did when it
was the first to publish Allan Gins
berg's "Howl" back in the day.
Unfortunately, things have
changed in the neighborhood since
the '60s. The pornography industry
has sunk its claws in deep, with a
major epicenter at Big Al's porn
store. If you think the store itself is
big, check out some of the "muscle
relaxers" within that top the fcK>t
mark. Or the walls of video.
Some of the restaurants man
aged to keep the old Italian flavor of
the neighborhood alive. Firenze by
Night is one such restaurant, where
the service is as charming as an Ital
ian playboy and the food is as solid as
<m Italian grandmother prodding
"Mange! Mange!" Cafe Trieste
holds up the Italian cafe end of
things.

Nanking's is a restaurant that
surprises most of its patrons. The
cheesy-looking Chinese eatery has
delectable food that leaves cus
tomers shaking their heads at the
decor. If you'd like some pan-Asian
food in a more upscale setting,
112 louse is more appropriate for you.
Bars in North Beach come in two
flavors. One type — the dive
bar/pool hall — dominates the area.
Columbus Cafe, although short on
pool tables, is a good example. Get
there between five and eight every
evening and your beers are two for
one.
The other flavor, the more new
age and sleek bar, is a bit more in
teresting. The Black Cat, also
named The Blue Bar, is the leader
of the pack, with stylish f<x>d and
drink for all. The only problem: the
ever present line stretching to the
end of the block.
Bimbo's is a '30s club with a plush
women's room for all the ladies.
Blind Tiger is a sleek, streamlined
club with good music sometimes.
Jazz at Pearls is an ugly club with
good jazz all the time. Evaluate your
priorities. Choose one.
