Stanford Student Enterprises
has created a business incubator to
allow Stanford student entrepre
neurs to develop and run their
own businesses. According to SSE
Projects Director Dave Endelman,
the incubator will also "foster an
entrepreneurial spirit on campus."
I he incubator, known as the
Stanford Project Incubator, started
providing advice and service this
fall to Stanford students interested
in starting their own business. It
will also help students who cur
rently own businesses and will
carry out projects suggested by
those who don't have the time or
interest to cam out their ideas.
Manager My Le Nguyen, a
sophomore, says the relationship
between the incubator and Stan
lord entrepreneurs is mutually
beneficial. According to her, "stu
dents gain hands-on experience
and resources" while the incubator
helps students and creates new

programs and services.
Stan lord Student Enterprises
will fund the incubator with rev
enue from businesses it runs such
as Lecture Notes and Flicks. SSF
staff, who have experience from
the student enterprise's other pro
jects, will assist the student entre
preneurs.
The incubator's roots extend
back to another SSE project
known as Stanford Ciroup Dis
counts. This program has set up
services such as summer storage
and Lake Tahoe vacation pack
ages for students.
Stanford Ciroup-Discounts will
continue to provide these services
for all students, while the incubator
will allow student entrepreneurs to
develop their owji businesses.
According to Nguyen, the in
cubator is a young organization
and has a lot of work ahead. At
this stage, SSE is trying to pro
mote the incubator throughout
the University. Eventually,
Nguyen hopes that the incubator
will become synonymous with en
trepreneurship.
"I've gotten such a good re
sponse," said Nguyen. "Everyone
I've talked to has a friend with an
idea who wants to work with the in
cubator."
