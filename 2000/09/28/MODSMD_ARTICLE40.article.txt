# South of Market
## 
### 
Really, South of Market is Downtown San Francisco.
Subtract all the office buildings and you are left with a
venue-heavy string of cultural oases in between the dirty al
leys (and often in the alleys themselves).
The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, one of the
reasons the city is on the map of world culture centers, is a
must see. Especially in (k tober, when the Anderson Collec
tion of modern art will be on display. One can find

such modern artists as Jackson Pollock, Clyflbrd Still,
Morris Lewis and Ad Rheinhardt on display there.

Visitors may even get to see the Jean
Miro lloorm.it that the Andersons
own.
South ol Market encompasses
many other museums that exploit*
topics from cartoon art to brewing
tactics. Also, San Francisco's main
civic buildings are also clustered
around Market Street. C.it\ 11.ill

Library, War Memorial Opera
I louse .ind (lit\ 11.ill All are majes
tic and invite photograph-taking
from the millions of tourists that
make their way through the well
treed plaza.
Good nighttime dining in the
area is sparse, as dinner sits square
ly in that no-man's land between
work and drink lor those that labor
in downtown. Dinner is the time to
switch from the black suit to the
black social wear for the evening.
Anyway, the clubs are what de
line the downtown neighborhood.
South of Market is home to some of
the definitive clubs <>1 more than one

genre of music.
Slim s is surli a bar. A heavy hitter
on the punk circuit, the small bar
was- host to both newly popular
MxPx ,iiul punk stalwart face 2
Face this week. Paradise Lounge
features good punk bands every
once in a while as well.
In the electronica scene, 1015

to establish < redibility. Sasha, a leg
end in some circles, got her start
spinning in 1015's large and loud
rooms. |ust don't bring any drugs,
as the club provides an extensive
and violating search service at the
door. The Sound Factor) and Sacri
fice both produce some good music.
Sacrifice is the newer and trencher
of the two.
Pow! has an obnoxious name,
but .iu interesting idea, at least lor
the video game lovers of the world.
Pow! provides Nintendo 64,
Dreamcast and Playstation consoles
for its customers' use. Absolute bril
liance.
Ending up the South of Market
experience can only be done at The
Fndup, a bar near the freeway that
never closes. A good place to let the
buzz wear off.
