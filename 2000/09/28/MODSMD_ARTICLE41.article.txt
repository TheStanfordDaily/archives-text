# The 						Mission
## 
### 
The Mission, defined roughly by Mission, Valen
cia and Guerrerro streets, is made up of an eclectic
mix of the Latino and gay neighborhoods that bot
tler each other in the area. The result is beautiful.
From Dolores Park east is the Castro; west a fam
ily-based Latino neighborhood. The two come to
gether in the park, where leather-bikini-dad men
will sunbathe next to a barbecuing family of four.
And every once in a while, a host of parrots shows up
to add more color to an already vibrant scene.
Mission Dolores, .it the corner of Kith and Do
lores, is the oldest standing building in the city. The
inside of the chapel is beautifully painted and serves
as <i bit of history for visitors. Down the street at the
Women's Building, check out another intense dis
play of public art. The mural on the building gains
power as your eyes climb, reaching
a crashing crescendo at the peak of
the house.
You can ( heck out Thrift Town
for some bargain buying, but the in
filtration of Internet money into the
neighborhood has sent some of the
prices upward. At least the selection
of second-run items is still good.
For your dining pleasure, try Ti
Couz. The crepes are incredible:
mouth-watering and unique com
binations that range from dinner
meat rollups to sweet dessert dishes,
llie Rooster offers a cuisine that
combines Eastern and Western
styles. Both are a bit pricey.
The Roxie, on 16th near Valen
cia, is not an AMC theater. Any
thing but. Ihis week, "Latino Life in
the United States" explores racial
stereotypes and tells some of the
story of El Vez, a Latino Elvis im
personator.
But really, the bars draw the
twenty-somethings to the Mission.
A got >d example of a San Franciscan
bar comes from The Elbo Room,
l'he Elbo is always crowded to the
gills with those that love to rub —
you guessed it — elbows. The bar
also selves as a venue, giving space
to artists to perform acid jazz, dub,
hip-hop, funk and more.
Zeitgeist on Tenth and Valencia
is a fun biker / punk bar. The out
side is set up as a beer garden, and
the beer selection is immense.
On your list should also be
Bruno's, a T>()s-style plush interior
bar iu which you could sip your
martini and listen to Sinatra. Maybe
also Mission Bar, ifonly because it's
named after the neighborhood.
