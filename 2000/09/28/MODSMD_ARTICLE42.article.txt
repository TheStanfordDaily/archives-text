# Eclectic 'Solaris' takes Photek beyond drum & bass
## 
### CHRIS GIGNOUX CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Rupert l'-arkes, aka Photek, lias
been consistently at the forefront
of electronic music, pushing the
limits of drum X: bass and estab
lisl)illit himself as .1 true composer
and not just it deejay. His tracks
pursue perfection with a minimal
style that never gets boring or
dated. With his album "Modus

Operandi" (Astralwerks, l ( .H)7)he
created one of I lie crowning
aehievements of drum & bass: an
album which was bolh lovely cof
fee tabic music'and devastating on
the dance floor. Since then, he
has made such dance floor an
thems as "Something Flse (the
bleeps tune)" and "Kxocet," as
well as remixing the early rave
tune "lnta Forces" with typical
Photek flair.
"Solaris" offers a bit of a differ
ent spin on Photek and his musi
cal desires. I he album starts
with the chaotic breakbeats and
moves on through abstract hip
hop and even house. While
branching into other genres,
fhotek's signature minimalism is
still evident, and lu>. production
skills are still flawless. While
"Modus Operandi" contained

songs like "The 1 lidden Camera"
and had a picture of a moonscape
on the cover, "Solaris" ends with
the song "Under the Palms" and
has cover art of blue water and
palm trees.
Photek, when discussing his
new sun-dreiK lied style, said,"()n
this album I'm not just looking at
the screen so much. You can get
lost m .ill those little graphs. I'm-

taken the blinkers oil. To gel to
I lie level I was at with heals pro
gramming, yon had to lotus so
much on what you were doing,
you tended to lose feeling."
That leeling is most evident on
the house track Glamourama and

his collaborations with house diva
Robert Owens: "Mine to Give"
and "Can't Come Down." Simple
and effective, with a symbiotic re
lationship of vocals and music, this
is an example of the way house
music should sound. I hese tracks
represent older house music, a bit
of his early influences from the pi
rate radio stations of England in
the '80s. The title track "Solaris"
adds a smooth synthesized chorus
over the 4/4 beats l'hotek has
grown to love. I'hotek's experi
mentation eventually leads him
away from house music 011 the
album, and he begins to explore
other genres.
The tracks "Terminus" and
"|unk" move toward breakbeats.
" Terminus" starts out with an un

Photek bassline, using minimal at
mospherics and skanky drums
that change very little over the
course of tlu 1 track's seven min
utes. Somehow "Terminus" man
ages to transcend the monotony ol
simple drum loops and really

sin ks ilie listener in, creating an
abstract world that manages to still
have soul.
"Junk" oilers a hit more of an
uplifting electronic vibe with cut
up bleeps and a filtered bassline
worthy of any dance lloor.
I lie most emotionally charged
track is undoubtedly "Lost Blue
I leaven," a collaboration with vo
calist Simone Simone, whose liq
uid voice is set within a frame
work of hip-hop beats and metal
lit effects. The piece embodys
the blue seascape on the cover.
Fans of Massive Attack and
Morcheeba will love the sound on
this track, whose blunted beats
and heavily effected vocals are
hauntingly beautiful.
Photek does not completely es
cape his roots however. Drum &
bass is represented 011 only one
track, but that track, "Infinity," is
the best 011 the album. Slowly
building sounds, a muted growl
ing bassline appears and brings in
a simple drum track, fun. and
more relaxed than his previous
beat experimentations. The locus
011 this track switches to a sophisti
catedstring lead over simple vocal
samples while maintaining a
background of rushing water in
keeping with his new flow.
"Solaris" is an album that shows
Photek's progression to a style all
his own. Drum & bass is not all
this man can do, and it shows. To
I'hotek, his latest album is "totally
free-reign, totally instinctive, to
tally relaxed." This mentality
comes through on "Solaris," an
amazing and eclectic masterpiece.
