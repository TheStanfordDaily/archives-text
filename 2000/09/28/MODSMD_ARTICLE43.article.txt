# 'Barenaked' angst

### MICHAEL BAER STAFF WRITER 
The quintet known .as Barenaked
Ladies had been one oft Canada's best-kept
secrets for almost a decade by 1998 when
they hit the bit* time with "One Week,"
from "Stunt," their fourth studio album. As
the track was somewhat of a novelty song,
the title of the album

was meant as a pun.
The title of their fol
low-up, "Maroon," also
has a deeper meaning,
hi this case, though, the
implications of the title
are more sinister than
self-denigration; here,
the band is pointing to
abandonment and
bloodshed.

It's surprising to hear such grave topic s
on a Barenaked Ladies CI), but they are
apparent. The album explores dysfunc
tional relationships, plastic people, sell
outs. war and death. They pull it oil with
surprising finesse, and both the band's
playing and songwriting are excellent.
However, these proficiencies alone do
not a great album make. Despite this, "Ma
roon," unlike "Stunt" and their debut,

"Gordon," is far from a great album.
for one thing, the production is too
crisp. 1 his is a band that works best when
it's a bit loose.
Another matter is appropriateness of
tone. Voices and sensabilities like the
Ladies' are not suited lor what is ultimate
ly a depressing album.
"Maroon" achieves gravity â€” but this
success is unnerving. "Conventioneers"
tells of .in ill-fated one-

n ijr lit stand, while
"Tonight is the Night I
Feel Asleep at the
Wheel" is the shot king
ly evocative stor) of a
car wreck. They are two
of the strongest songs
on the album, but nei
ther thev nor any of the

several other good
songs on the album are as catchy or "cute"
as the immensely successful "One Week.".
Still the band's humour is not absent,
but this time around, things are far darker
than they've ever been. Kven the mostly
humourous "Sell Sell Sell" and "Never Do
Anything" are about men who have basi
cally wasted their lives. And " The I lutnour
of the Situation" is downright nasty.
The fact that bassist Jim Creegan had a
bout with leukemia may have something to

do with this dark streak ol sell-examina
tion, but this remains speculation.
Ultimately, one would suspect that "Ma
roon" will be more ola transitional album
than anything else. In this fashion, it is sim
ilar to their sophomore effort, "Maybe You

Should Drive," also a more serious effort
than its predecessor. Those interested in
another "Stunt"-like album will be severely
disappointed and are recommended to
venture into the band's back-catalogue be
fore braving "Maroon."
