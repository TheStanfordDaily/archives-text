# Watch Moore 'Rage' against the two-party duopoly
## 
### JUNG LAH EDITORIAL STAFF 
Michael Moore is a genius. Nest
known l<>r "Roger and Me," his
award winning documentary of
General Motors' economic tenor
ism in his hometown of Mint,
Michigan, Moore also starred in
the short-lived but hilariously
funny show "TV Nation." I leeven
made a stop at Stanford three
years ago while promoting his
hook "Downsize This!" and his

film " I lie Big ()ne," both political
satires ili.it explore the evils ol cor
porate Vmerit a simply by telling
the ti litli.
Recenth, Moore has teamed up
with the leftist hardcore hand
Rage Against the Machine, and it
is turning out to be a brilliant pair
ing. The two have turned out a
couple of politically < barged music
videos that have more of a mes
sage than just "buy my record."
In I act, Moore's direction of the
second of these videos, the recent
ly released "Testify," offers a
scathing look at the stranglehold
the two-party system has on our
country's political arena, and it
may be one of the most amazingly
produced mainstream music
videos ever made.
"Testify," as a song, is an an
them that effectively portrays the
band's anger over the popular
media's blind and biased coverage
of world events, which perpetrates
an ignorant and unknowing pub
lic audience. " festify" as a video,
however, oilers confrontational

visual commentary to the hand's
lyrical attack, produc ing an end
result that is not onl\ successful
but downright brilliant.
The video begins with black
and white footage of a UFO and
people in cheesy "alien" space
suits. Subtitles read "Aliens plot to
conquer Earth!" and "Launch the
mutant now!" Then, one comput
er-generated face, a hybrid of the
faces ol Bush and ( »ore, splits into
two separate faces while a subtitle
reads "He appears as two but
speaks as one!" The next shot
shows real clips of Bush and (iore
saying exactly the same things,
such as "I support the death
penalty" and "Prosperity from
free and lair trade." The video
goes on to tell its tale: The Bush-
Gore mutant(s) spoilt the same
rhetorit across the country, merge
back into 01 igitial form as a single
alien, then fl\ away in their spat e
craft.
This satirical look at the upcom
ing election is amusing by itself,
but Moore's direction gives the
video remarkable depth by pre
senting and juxtaposing images in
a manner that is both witty and
darkly humorous.
As frontman Zach de la Rocha
launches into the lyrics of "Testi
fy," images of the band perform
ing the song are intercut with
footage from the protests .it the
Democratic National Convention
in Los Angeles. Demonstrators are
marching peacefully before the
video cuts to the Los Angeles Po
lice Department shooting rubber
bullets at a retreating crowd and
cops in full riot gear with billy
clubs violenth attacking unarmed
protestors. "We found your weak
ness, and it's right outside your
door," de la Rocha sings, while the
image shifts from the Los Angeles
Police Department to pigs to a
bacon manufacturing plant.

During the chorus of the song,
tlu* images are equally biting.
While de la Kocha is yelling out
"Now testify!" he raises up his
right hand as if swearing in to a
jury. Then, the video shifts to var
ious individuals also raising up
their right hands. The list includes
Oliver North, Newt Gingrich,
Monica Lewinsky, Clarence
Thomas, Hill Clinton and the
Pope.
In other parts of the video,
shots of Bush and Gore are inter
cut with dips of a woman rolling
around in a pile of money and a fat
man smiling while two bikini-clad
women hang on each of his arms.
All ol these images, when viewed
in sequence, heighten the lyrical
power of the song, and come off
much better than written descrip
tion can represent.
Subtle visual cues match the
song lyrics with precision. The
Pentagon flashes on screen during
the words "Your temple, it calms
me." G.is station signs show their
high prices while de la Kocha re
peats the phrase "Mass graves for
the pump and tlu* price is set,"
then points a gas pump at his own
head like a gun. When the lyrics
claim "Who controls the past now
controls the future,"the video
shows pictures of old presidents
and then flashes to a shot of their
faces on dollar bills being printed
out en masse.
At one point. Bush's face in a
freeze frame is covered with text
documenting where his campaign
money comes from, along with
specific dollar amounts from vari
ous big corporations. Kight after
wards, Gore's face and corporate
sponsors paint the same financial
picture. More clips of Bush and
(.ore saying identical things culmi
nate in each man's proclamation
of "(»od bless you." 112 fearing them
speak so similarly in these side-by

side shots is both an accurate and
frightening representation of our
modern-day political reality.
The video ends with Green
Party candidate Ralph Nader
warning us, "If you're not turned
onto politics, politics will turn on
you." The final screen shot has an
American llag waving in the hack
ground with the words "In No
vember, it is estimated that the ma
jority of Americans — nearly 100
million people — will not vote sim
ply for lack of a real choice on the
ballot."
This message, although a de
pressing one, raises questions that
the Britney-Spears-loving MTV

watchers are probably not used to
asking. And if this video causes any
of those people to do some re
search on the political system and
become informed voters (when
they become of age), then Rage
and Moore have done something
extremely positive, an effort that
needs to be recognized in this gen
eration of political apathy.

No justice, no peace, no racist police!
Michael Moore is a genius. Nest
known l<>r "Roger and Me," his
award winning documentary of
General Motors' economic tenor
ism in his hometown of Mint,
Michigan, Moore also starred in
the short-lived but hilariously
funny show "TV Nation." I leeven
made a stop at Stanford three
years ago while promoting his
hook "Downsize This!" and his

film " I lie Big ()ne," both political
satires ili.it explore the evils ol cor
porate Vmerit a simply by telling
the ti litli.
Recenth, Moore has teamed up
with the leftist hardcore hand
Rage Against the Machine, and it
is turning out to be a brilliant pair
ing. The two have turned out a
couple of politically < barged music
videos that have more of a mes
sage than just "buy my record."
In I act, Moore's direction of the
second of these videos, the recent
ly released "Testify," offers a
scathing look at the stranglehold
the two-party system has on our
country's political arena, and it
may be one of the most amazingly
produced mainstream music
videos ever made.
"Testify," as a song, is an an
them that effectively portrays the
band's anger over the popular
media's blind and biased coverage
of world events, which perpetrates
an ignorant and unknowing pub
lic audience. " festify" as a video,
however, oilers confrontational

visual commentary to the hand's
lyrical attack, produc ing an end
result that is not onl\ successful
but downright brilliant.
The video begins with black
and white footage of a UFO and
people in cheesy "alien" space
suits. Subtitles read "Aliens plot to
conquer Earth!" and "Launch the
mutant now!" Then, one comput
er-generated face, a hybrid of the
faces ol Bush and ( »ore, splits into
two separate faces while a subtitle
reads "He appears as two but
speaks as one!" The next shot
shows real clips of Bush and (iore
saying exactly the same things,
such as "I support the death
penalty" and "Prosperity from
free and lair trade." The video
goes on to tell its tale: The Bush-
Gore mutant(s) spoilt the same
rhetorit across the country, merge
back into 01 igitial form as a single
alien, then fl\ away in their spat e
craft.
This satirical look at the upcom
ing election is amusing by itself,
but Moore's direction gives the
video remarkable depth by pre
senting and juxtaposing images in
a manner that is both witty and
darkly humorous.
As frontman Zach de la Rocha
launches into the lyrics of "Testi
fy," images of the band perform
ing the song are intercut with
footage from the protests .it the
Democratic National Convention
in Los Angeles. Demonstrators are
marching peacefully before the
video cuts to the Los Angeles Po
lice Department shooting rubber
bullets at a retreating crowd and
cops in full riot gear with billy
clubs violenth attacking unarmed
protestors. "We found your weak
ness, and it's right outside your
door," de la Rocha sings, while the
image shifts from the Los Angeles
Police Department to pigs to a
bacon manufacturing plant.

During the chorus of the song,
tlu* images are equally biting.
While de la Kocha is yelling out
"Now testify!" he raises up his
right hand as if swearing in to a
jury. Then, the video shifts to var
ious individuals also raising up
their right hands. The list includes
Oliver North, Newt Gingrich,
Monica Lewinsky, Clarence
Thomas, Hill Clinton and the
Pope.
In other parts of the video,
shots of Bush and Gore are inter
cut with dips of a woman rolling
around in a pile of money and a fat
man smiling while two bikini-clad
women hang on each of his arms.
All ol these images, when viewed
in sequence, heighten the lyrical
power of the song, and come off
much better than written descrip
tion can represent.
Subtle visual cues match the
song lyrics with precision. The
Pentagon flashes on screen during
the words "Your temple, it calms
me." G.is station signs show their
high prices while de la Kocha re
peats the phrase "Mass graves for
the pump and tlu* price is set,"
then points a gas pump at his own
head like a gun. When the lyrics
claim "Who controls the past now
controls the future,"the video
shows pictures of old presidents
and then flashes to a shot of their
faces on dollar bills being printed
out en masse.
At one point. Bush's face in a
freeze frame is covered with text
documenting where his campaign
money comes from, along with
specific dollar amounts from vari
ous big corporations. Kight after
wards, Gore's face and corporate
sponsors paint the same financial
picture. More clips of Bush and
(.ore saying identical things culmi
nate in each man's proclamation
of "(»od bless you." 112 fearing them
speak so similarly in these side-by

side shots is both an accurate and
frightening representation of our
modern-day political reality.
The video ends with Green
Party candidate Ralph Nader
warning us, "If you're not turned
onto politics, politics will turn on
you." The final screen shot has an
American llag waving in the hack
ground with the words "In No
vember, it is estimated that the ma
jority of Americans — nearly 100
million people — will not vote sim
ply for lack of a real choice on the
ballot."
This message, although a de
pressing one, raises questions that
the Britney-Spears-loving MTV

watchers are probably not used to
asking. And if this video causes any
of those people to do some re
search on the political system and
become informed voters (when
they become of age), then Rage
and Moore have done something
extremely positive, an effort that
needs to be recognized in this gen
eration of political apathy.
