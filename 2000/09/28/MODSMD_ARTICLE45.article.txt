# 'Psychotic' puts its best personality forward
## 
### JENNIFER LINDSEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"VVhy would people want to
watch me talk about my problems
for 130 minutes?" This question
plagued Bruce Pachtman as he em
harked on the development ofhis
first play, "Don't Make Me Look
l oo Psychotic," a one-man show at
San Francisco's Bannam Place
Theater.
Twenty weeks later, in the midst
of a successful run and an extension
through Oct. 14, Pachtman is start
ing to realize the contemporary au
dience's relish for frankness, sincer
ity and a lack of theatrical artifice
that seem long-lost in these days of
stage spectacle and rotating plat
forms.
Pachtman uses his ISO minutes
to relate a story of a tumultuous ro
mantic relationship, alternately
peppered by snags of his tumul
tuous relationship with his mother.
Although the transitions between
two disparate stories tend to weak
en the overall project. Pachtman
employs his fine characterization
skills to clearly represent his moth
er and his lover in various harrow-

ing trysts.
Pachtman tells his own story in a
voice of near omniscience: by the
end ofhis piece the audience leaves
with a clearer understanding of the
characters in his lilt- — his lover,
Gloria, and his mom — than of
Pachtman himself.
This is perhaps because Pacht
man refrains from indulging in
statements of feeling, lodising in

stead upon fact — "I finally refused
to give Gloria an orgasm that night
and she fell to my knees, sobbing as
I had never seen another adult
sob."
While this rigid attention to de
tail compromises Pachtman's de
velopment of his own character in
the piece, as he remains a non
judgmental observer, it sharpens
the poignant desperation of the lost
woman with whom he is involved.
Pachtman performs before a
nearly sold-out audience every

evening, as North Beach tourists
seeking entertainment are led to
"Don't Make Me Look Too Psy
chotic" by (lie helpful hut mislead
ing reviews that proclaim the show
to he "gut-bustingly funny." This
creates an expectation of uproar

<md hilarity, and ini
tial disappointment
when Pachtman lum
bers onto the stage
and launches into a
very personal, very
frank and very inti
mate account of the
unhealthy relation
ships in his life.
This frankness
quickly emerges as
the show's strength,

however, as Pacht
man addresses audience members
as though they are dear friends.
The story is less engaging when he
digresses onto conversational
peninsulas about his sister, employ
ing some moments of theater arti
fice when discussing his sister's
near-suicide.
The success of" Don't Make Me
Look Too Psychotic" is hardly sur
prising, given the sheer entertain
ment value of the material; but this

same success raises questions about
contemporary audience members
and their desires and expectatk>ns (>f

his open discussion of the plumpest
