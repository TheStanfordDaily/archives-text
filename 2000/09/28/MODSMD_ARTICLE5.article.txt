### KARI LUNDGREN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
All undergraduates who re
quested University housing at Sun
day night's meeting for unassigned
students received rooms on cam
pus.
More than (><) students using a
guaranteed year of housing were
assigned to a residence on Sunday,
filling the rooms of those students
who decided to stop out fora quar
ter, opted to study abroad or will be
otherwise absent from campus this
quarter.
Unassigned students initially
drew a high number — near S,()()()
— and as a result were not assigned
a residence in the spring and
placed on a wait list.
Some students were assigned
over the summer as housing slots
opened.
An additional 32 students who
applied late for the Draw, limited
the number of residences in which
they wanted to live or originally
opted not to enter the spring hous
ing lottery were also assigned to
residences by Tuesday afternoon.
According to Todd Benson,
manager of housing assignment
services, the number of'people
who just showed up was "signifi
cantly higher" this year than last
year.
The spring wait list was also
larger this year than last year, said
Benson.
One reason for the increase in
the si/.e of these lists was the large
sophomore class, whose members
occupied more rooms than in
other years, Benson said. The high
rents for area apartments also

drove more students to look lor
on-campus housing, further in
creasing the number.
Depending on the housing slots
available, some students were as
signed to typically low-drawing
Row houses.
()thers were placed in four-class
dormitories in Stern Hall or
Wilbur 1 fall. Those with the lowest
original numbers were given the
first choices of housing.
Benson said the stall in the
housing assignment ollice worked
very hard this year to assign stu
dents to open spaces as quickly as
possible.
"The housing worked out OK
because we got housing on the lust
day, but it was still a little stressful,"
said junior |ared Lee, who was as
signed to C'.asa Zapata.
Lee added that he had been
concerned he wouldn't even be
housed, even though all University
students are guaranteed four years
of housing.
"I didn't like that we have to
wait to the very last minute to see if
we got housing," he said.
Sophomore Adrian Wong said
his Draw group had chosen to use
a preferred year and wound up
with a Draw number of 1,687.
However, the group selected
the option that limits their result
ing assignment to being nothing
other than one of the original eight
residences selected, and wound up
unassigned.
"1 think it's really important
for people to know this and very
few people do," Wong said.
Wong and his drawmates were
told Sunday that they would be
living in Serra in Stern Hall.
