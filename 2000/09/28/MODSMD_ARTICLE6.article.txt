# Hospitals lose $43 million
## 
### JULIANA LIU EDITORIAL STAFF 
Officials at Stanford's two hospitals
announced earlier this month that fi
nancial losses incurred over the summer
— partly as the result of the 51 day nurs
es' strike for increased pay and benefits
— total approximately $43 million.
Ken Sharigian, the hospital's chief fi
nancial officer, said $30 million of the
losses directly resulted from the two
month nurses' strike. The strike ended
in early August after the union, known
as the Committee for the Recognition of
Nursing Achievements, accepted a com
promise including a five percent pay
iiike each year for two years.
Officials brought in 500 temporary
replacement nurses and extra security
officers to keep the hospitals running
during the strike. Both hospitals lost
money as patients postponed treatment
or were transferred to other hospitals,
Sharigian said.
Striking nurses skewered the hospi
tals' decision to continue operations
without resolving the labor dispute.
"We were absolutely disgusted with
the hospitals' choosing to pay replace
ment nurses a huge amount of money
instead of putting a small amount of that

into the nurses contract," said union
president Sue Weinstein. "I don't think
it's ever appropriate to bring in scabs
[ rep lace men t nurses]."
Sharigian said that without hiring
registry nurses during the strike, the
hospitals would have been (breed to op
erate at 15 to 20 percent of capacity. Ac
cording to him, that would result in a
greater loss of $45 million each month
and the layoff of hundreds of other hos
pital employees.
Sharigian told the San Jose Mercury
News that as a result ol the losses, the
hospitals will continue to cut costs and
that layoffs are unlikely. The hospitals
will use reserves to cover the losses, he
said.
The other $13 million in losses result
ed from costs associated with the dissolu
tion of the merger with UC-San Francis
co's hospitals, Sharigian said.
Although the merger was officially dis
solved on April 1, costs from the break
up still accrued over the summer.
Stanford's two hospitals merged
with UC-San Francisco in 1997 to
streamline operations and combat the
loss of Medicare funding from the
federal government.
