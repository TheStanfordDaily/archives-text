Dear Sir,
I was a iciest at your restaurant and I chose to eat
two of your specials and they were excellent One
was the corn soup with cumin, Would you be
wl willing to send me the recipe?
LTO ' liked It so much that I would enjoy preparing It for
my husband. (I'm not a good enough cook to
prepare the main course, the grilled dorado, but I
'— compliment you on that as well)
THE NEW VOMER I look forward to my next meal at Pro Bono I shall
recommend your restaurant to my friends In the
San Francisco area.
Sincerely,
