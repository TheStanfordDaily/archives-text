SF schools superintendent
requests investigation of
district
SAN FRANK 1ISC.() (AP) — The San Francisco
schools superintendent is asking tlie (.it\ Attorney s of
fice to investigate the school district.
Arlene Ackerman asked the ollice two weeks ago to
check into whether some district practices are improp
er, including how contracts are awarded, and the use of
consultants.
The San Francisco Examiner reports that state audi
tors found 10 of 1 I contracts awarded between July
1999 and March 2000 involved serious violations of the
law. The alleged violations included contracts awarded
without bids and contracts that were split in order to
avoid needing approval from the school board.
One school board member said the district had hired
consultants to do work that should have been per
formed by permanent employees. That could result in
large lines from the Internal Revenue Service.
