## FDA approves use of abortion pill RU-486 
### 
WASHINCTON (AP) — Capping a
bitter 12-year battle, the government
approved use of the abortion pill RU-486
yesterday, a major victory for abortion
lights advocates that could dramatically
alter abortion in this country.
1 he long-expected decision by the
Food and Drug Administration allows
Americans an early-abortion method
already used in France, Britain, China
and 10 other countries. The action is
expec ted to make abortion in the United
States more accessible and more private.
Coming in the final weeks of the pres
idential campaign, the move also is sure
to renew fierce political debate. Republi
can candidate George VV. Bush, whose
father's administration banned RU-486
imports in 1989, opposes abortion. Vice
President Gore supports the pill option.
The pill, known chemically as mifepri
stone and by the brand name Mifeprex,
will be available to doctors within a
month.
Mifepristone, which blocks a hormone
vital to sustaining pregnancy, only works
during the first seven weeks of pregnan
cy, when an embryo is about one-fifth of
,m inch; th.it is earlier than surgical abor
tions often are offered.
Two clays after taking mifepristone,
women lake a second drug that causes
c ramping and bleeding as the embryo is
expelled, much like a miscarriage.
"For those who c hoose to have an early

termination of their pregnancy, I his is a
reasonable medical alternative," said FDA
Commissioner Jane Henney, who
approved mifepristone based on studies
that found ii 92 percent to 95 percent
elk-dive in causing abortion.
Complications are rare; serious bleed
ing occurs in 1 percent of women. But the
pill-caused abortion requires three dot tor
visits and, to ensure ii is performed accu
rately, the FDA restricted iis use to doc
tors with certain training and mandated
that detailed patient-information
brochures be given to even woman.
Proponents hailed FDA's move.
Although some doctors already use a c an
cer drug called methotrexate to cause
abortion — legal although not formally
FDA-approved — they said mifepristone
will increase access to the nonsurgical
method.
"At long last, science trumps anti-abor
tion politics and medical McCarthyism,"
said Eleanor Smeal of the Feminist
Majority Foundation.
Mifepristone may "turn the tide
against anti-choice intimidation," because
doctors who don't offer surgical abortion
can use the pill in private offices instead
of protester-targeted clinics, added
Planned Parenthood president Cloria
Feldt.
But anti-abortion groups, which
fought mifepristone by threatening l .S.
drug companies with bovrotts, pledged to

continue fighting.
"We will not tolerate the FDA's deci
sion to approve the destruction of inno
cent human persons through chemical
abortion," said Judie Brown of the Amer
ican Life League.
"Never before has the FDA approved
a drug intended to kill people," said
Rep. Fom Coburn, R-Okla., who
promised legislation calling for severe
limits on which doc tors could administer
mifepristone.
On the campaign trail. Bush called the
FDA's decision "wrong," saying "1 fear
that making this abortion pill widespread
will make abortions mot e and more com
mon." 1 lis campaign said if elected. Bush
wouldn't have the authority to overturn
the FDA's decision, but he would order a
probe of whether the agency's review was
influenced In politics.
(lore praised the pill's availability.
" I odav's decision is not about politics, but
the health and safety of American women
and a woman's fundamental right to
choose, he said.
Health experts note abortions did not
increase when Rl -186 debuted in France
in 1988, or later across Europe.
I he pill's journey to the United States
began in 1994, when French manufactur
er Roussel-l'claf turned over U.S. rights
to the drug to the nonprofit Population
Council o! New York. 1 he counc il began
clinical trials needed lot FDA approval

and created Danco Laboratories, a small
company thai will market mifepristone.
The FDA in 1996 declared mifepris
tone a safe and ellective early abortion
method, but delayed approval because
Danco had problems satisfying manufac
turing <iiul other final requirements.

President Clinton said the FDA's four
year investigation shows the decision was
"purely one of science and medicine." 112 fe
said the FDA "bent over backward to do a
lot of serious inquiries. . . . They took so
long to try to make sure they were mak
ing a good decision."
