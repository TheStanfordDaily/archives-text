# Former Canadian PM dies at 80

### 
MONTREAL (AP) — Former Prime
Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, a flam
boyant and charismatic political giant
who led the country through some of its
most tumultuous events, died yesterday.
I le was 80.
Trudeau died of prostate cancer, said
Roy Heenan, senior partner of the
Montreal law firm Heenan Blaikie,
where Trudeau worked.
He said the Trudeau's health had
been declining "very steadily" in the last
few days. Trudeau's sons Justin and
Sac ha Trudeau also confirmed their
father's death.
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chre
tien praised Trudeau as a force for
change that continues to "shape the soul
of his people."
I le said Trudeau "dreamed of a soci
ety that afforded all of its citizens an
equal opportunity to succeed in life."
Heenan described Trudeau as "a
great man, not only in his public life but
from our point view, from his private
life as well."
I'rudeau was hospitalized for 10 days
with pneumonia at the beginning of the
year, and associates say he never fully
regained his strength. He also was
believed to be suffering from Parkin
son's disease.
During 10 years as prime minister,
briefly interrupted by a 1979 election
defeat, Trudeau seemed to personify
the dynamic political and social changes
in North America with a sophisticated,
sometimes irreverent style that fascinat
ed and captivated his country.
Cosmopolitan and witty with a flair
for celebrity, he represented a sharp
departure from the generally dry,
provincial politicians of Canada's past.
So strong was his personality and
influence, Trudeau was chosen Cana
da's newsmaker of the century in a
Canadian Press-Broadcast News poll of
editors and broadcasters in December
1999.
In typical Trudeau style, he
described himself as "surprised and
quite pleased" at learning of the honor,
but refused -to be swayed from his per
sonal desire for privacy in his post-polit
ical life.
A sharp, energetic figure, he wore
sandals to Parliament, dated celebrities
such as Barbra Streisand and actress
Margo Kidder, flashed an obscene hand
signal to protesters and once did a
pirouette behind the back of Britain's
Queen Elizabeth.
Politically, Trudeau came to promi
nence at the height of the 00s revolution
and his policies reflected changing atti
tudes. As justice minister in 1907, he lib
eralized laws on abortion and homosex
uality, then continued to introduce new

direction upon becoming Canada's 15th
prime minister a year later.
A Montreal native, he made French
an official language with English, pro
moted the metric system, led the light
against Quebec separatists, and in what
was his most profound legacy,
enshrined the Charter of Rights in a
new Canadian Constitution in 1982.
He married Margaret Sinclair, a
"flower child" half his age, in 1971 and
they had three sons before their 1977
separation and eventual divorce, which
received the kind of media attention
normally given lilm st;us.
He is survived by two adult sons. His
grief Over the death of his youngest son.

Michel, in an avalanche in 1998 at age
23, was considered a lactor in his hospi
talization tor pneumonia during the
new millennium celebrations.
Despite Irudeau's celebrity, the
changes he inspired brought inevitable
opposition from some segments of
Canadian socielv. I lie Quebec sepa
ratist movement gained strength in bat
tling I rudeau's eflbrts toward federal
ism, and the Western-based Reform
Part\ was created in part from lingering
resentment in oil-rich Alberta over the
National Energy Program imposed by
the Trudeau government in 1980 that
increased federal control over energy
resources.
