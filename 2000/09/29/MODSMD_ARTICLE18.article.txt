NEW YORK (AP) — The euro
dropped slightly against most foreign cur
rencies yesterday as Danish voters decid
ed not to adopt the European single cur
rency in <i closely-contested referendum.
With nearly 90 percent of the votes
counted, :">3 percent opposed making the
euro Denmark's c urrency, while 47 per
cent favored the switch, according to the
Interior Ministry.
The euro dropped below the key tec h
nical level of 88 cents, but was able to
recover in late New York trading, quoted
at 88.13 cents, down from 88.30 cents late
Wednesday.
"The euro has come under a little bit
of pressure as a result. The market is sell
ing the euro off modestly," said Ron
Simpson, senior currency analyst at
M( 1M Currencywatch.
The long-term economic impact of
Denmark's decision not to join the euro
will not be significant, Simpson said, but
could alter the entry of Sweden and
Britain, two other EU countries where
voters have also opted to retain their indi
vidual currencies.
"It mav turn into a case where the EU

may attract poorer countries, Simpson
said, tiling the- entry <>l Greece — which
was initially barred from membership
because of high inllation and a budget
deficit — into the single currency next Jan.
1. "We will have to wait and see whether
that translates into a weaker currency."
The euro plunged to record lows, trad
ing at 84.38 just over a week ago, in a free
fall sparked earlier this month by com
ments from German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder.
The European currency was propped
up last Friday alter the U.S. Federal
Reserve unexpectedly joined the Euro
pean (lentral Batik and the Bank of Japan
to intervene in the currency market.
Currency traders said that although
the intervention has been scaring them
from trying to sell the euro too aggres
sively, they will continue to test the mar
ket on the downside.
"If it goes below 87 cents we might see
some concerted action on behalf of the
ECB," Simpson said, adding that the ECB
may want to intervene at current levels to
show continued support for the flagging
currency.
