WASHINGTON (AP) â€” President
Clinton yesterday urged Yugoslav Presi
dent Slobodan Milosevic to "heed the call of
the Serb people," honor the election of his
pro-democracy challenger and step down.
Clinton said results from elections
Sunday indicate that Milosevic's oppo
nent, Vojislav Kostunica, won "an abso
lute majority" of the vote. In a statement,
he said there was no basis for the runoff
election Milosevic is maneuvering to set
up, and offered to remove economic
sanctions once Milosevic leaves.
" I he people of Yugoslavia have spo
ken loud and clear in support of demo
cratic change," Clinton said. "It is time for
Mr. Milosevic to heed the call of the Serb
people, step down, and allow a peaceful
democratic transition to take place."
The I niled States has sought Milose
vic's ouster since it led NATO air strikes
on Belgrade last year in response to
attacks on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
Earlier yesterday, before having lunch
with Prime Minister Wim kok of the
Netherlands, Clinton said all NATO
nations should consider lifting the sanc
tions if Milosevic is removed from power.

While lie did not then refer to Milose
vic by name, Clinton said that "it's clear
the people prefer"' Kostunica. When
asked later whether lit- was (ailing for
Milosevic to step down, Clinton told
reporters, "That's what 1 think should
happen.
"When that happens, 1 would strongly
support immediate moves to lift the sanc
tions," ( linton said. "I think we should all
say, in unequivocal terms, as soon as there
is democratic government there, the
sanctions should he lifted."
Milosevic yesterday refused to recog
nize Kostunica's apparent victory in Sun
day's elections, saying lie would move
ahead with plans for an Oct. 8 runoff.
The State Election Commission said Kos
tunica earned 48.96 percent of the vote to
38.62 percent for Milosevic, but opposi
tion poll watchers said Kostunica won
52.54 percent of the vote, compared with
32.01 percent for Milosevic.
In Washington, State Department
spokesman Philip Reeker s.iid a runoff is
not necessary. "It's an issue of who won,
and Dr. Kostunica won this election,"
Reeker said.
