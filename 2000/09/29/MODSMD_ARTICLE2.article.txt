1 he celebrated first hole of the
Stanford Golf Course may yet be
the home to future Tom Watsons
and Tiger Woods.
Reversing an announcement
made by Athletic Director Ted
Leland at a press conference last
Friday, University President
John Hennessy and Palo Alto
Mayor Li/. Kniss proposed a plan
yesterday that would preserve
Stanford's golf course while still
allowing for new faculty housing
to be built.
The new plan, which calls for an
amendment to a 1997 contractual
agreement between Palo Alto and
Stanford, would allow the Univer
sity to build faculty housing on a
site adjacent to the golf course,
thus allowing for the first hole tobe
preserved.
1 he agreement being amended
originally restricted the use of 108
acres of Stanford land along Sand
llill Road to athletic fields, acade
mic field research and open space

until 2020. Stanford had proposed
relocating the first hole of the golf
course, because it sits on land that
under the 1997 agreement could
be developed for much-needed
faculty housing.
The new plan would leave the
first hole intact by designating a
13-acre parcel on Searsville Road
and an adjacent 25-acre lot on
Campus Drive for faculty housing.
"We feel this is a good solution
to a challenging problem of hous
ing needs," Kniss said. "This will
allow us to protect the hallowed
first hole and the surrounding nat
ural habitat while providing very
needed housing."
Stanford's Director of Govern
ment and Community Relations
Larry Horton echoed Kniss's sen
timent. saying,"l think it's a posi
tive solution and am very pleased.
We're very grateful to Mayor
Kniss."
Horton feels that Kniss's sup
port, along with the community's
strong desire to preserve Stan
ford's golf course, will convince the
Palo Alto Planning Commission

and ihe Palo Alto City Council to
approve the amendment to the
1997 Sand Hill Road Develop
ment Agreement. Their approval
is needed before the new plan can
be implemented.
1 lennessy also said he is pleased
that kniss supports the new pro
posal. "This would be a happy out
come for all parties," he said. "We
would still have the same amount
of space available lor faculty hous
ing, and we would preserve a

much-valued part of the Stanford
golf course."
The new proposal would pre
clude the need to reroute the first
seven holes of the golf course.
"We were hoping all along that
this was a possibility," said Leland.
"We're thrilled that we can now ac
commodate the University's hous
ing needs while at the same time
maintaining the integrity and ar
chitecture of the Stanford Golf
Course."
