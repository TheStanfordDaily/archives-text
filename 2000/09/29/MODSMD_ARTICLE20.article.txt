Theme decorations in Row house
display racial insensitivity
So what's the excuse this lime, guys?
"We didn't mean anything by it," "We
really didn't know," "That's not how we
meant it, 1 hat's not actually what it
means," "We just don't care" or "I lere at
Stanford we have the freedom to be as
racially insensitive as we choose to be"?
1 can't wait to hear this one.
I his is only my second year at Stan
ford, but this is the third incident involv
ing the racially insensitive "mainstream"
student bodv in that short period of
time.
Whose idea was it to proudly display
the theme "Xanadukes of Hazard,"
which includes a replica of the Confed
erate Flag plastered all over the dorm?
Did anv ol'vou take American history,
<>i did \ou )iist score high on the AP test
without ever actually learning the strug
gles of any other group of people besides
vour own? Did any of you consider lor
one second that the Confederate flag
represents, ot at least brings unpleasant
remembrance to, a place and time when
African-Americans endured a cruel and
malicious hardship called slavery?
1 would guess not. |ust as in the ( lass
pride misrepresentation on last year's
freshmen 1 -shirts and the "Pimps and
Whores" posters in West Lagunita, 1 bet
that this can be attributed to sheer igno
rance and disregard toward the African
American community on this c ampus.
No words can adequately capture the
pure disgust I feel toward this type of
ignorance and insensitivity. This is not
.in issue of your free speech or you not
meaning any harm. This is an issue of
some students using a little bit of the
intelligence that got them here to realize
that some of the things that they think
are cute and funnv are blatantly disre
spect lul.
Let's Hip the script. How would the
c ampus feel if the Resident Assistants in

I jamaa, the African American theme
dorm, decided that "Uj-Stika" sounded
really cute and clever as a theme? What
if they replicated the Swastika, only
making slight alterations to it, and hung
those little replicas all over the clorin,
including on the doors of |ewish stu
dents and in lull view of all potentially
ollended faculty, stall'and students who
lived in or visited Lagunita Court?
1 mean, they have their freedom of
speech. The Swastika didn't actually
start out as a symbol ol hatred and geno
cide. Fumed a certain way and altered
slightly, the symbol could look artistic,
right?
Wrong. There is one problem that
remains. If the group of people who
used that symbol to represent their ide
als had won World War 11. the contin
ued pain inllirted upon the European
Jewish c ommunity, to name only one, is
at this point unimaginable.
I cannot believe that this type of igno
rance exists on this campus. Most of
Stanford's community service organiza
tions focus on the low socioeconomic sta
tus groups of l ast Palo Alto, Redwood
City, and other neighboring communi
ties. Maybe some of us should reach out
to the sheltered, unexposed kids in Palo
Alto or San Francisco, who may leave
their s< hools well-educated and in touch
with innumerable resources, but quite
unable to function in a society that
includes minorities.
Even though some people on campus
have decided that this isn't really an
issue, 1 am making an issue ol it. I am
not a representative of the entire black
student bodv. but, .is an individual who
will not tolerate this tvpe of ignorance, I
will continue to speak out against insen
sitive blows to the African American
community on this campus. This is defi
nitel\ one of them.

Regarding your editorial "Dish modi
fications unpleasant and unjustified"
(Sept. 27): While you're certainly entitled
to your opinions, I.tin disappointed that
with such .in opportunity to speak to an
audience that needs lessons ol respect lor
the environment and private property,
you wasted the opportuniu with soplio
moric banter.
Your complaints that guards make vis
its to the lulls unpleasant and paved

roads subject runners to impact-related
injuries trip in their attempt at research.
The lads are these: the paved road is
asphalt, not hard concrete. I he signs
indicating the recreational route are
barch noticeable. They are not advertis
ing billboards that you lind on Highway
101. And they do not, as your prose
would have us believe, "obstruct the view
and disturb the sanctity of space."
I walk on these hills daily. I lind the
presence of guards welcoming and reas
suring. I lind the absence of dogs a big
plus, flic hills are not a delecatoriuni lor

ilie Peninsula's pets.
Contrary to your view that Stanford's
restrictions were "a thinly veiled attempt
to place distance between Stanford and
its residents," restrictions were essential
because, when it comes to our respect for
the environment, we are all scum.
More importantly, you fail to examine
why Stanford, a private university,
should squander its precious resources to
operate a public park.

Contrary to your view that Stanford's
restrictions were "a thinly veiled attempt
to place distance between Stanford and
its residents," restrictions were essential
because, when it comes to our respect for
the environment, we are all scum.
More importantly, you fail to examine
why Stanford, a private university,
should squander its precious resources to
operate a public park.
