Cincinnati Bearcats on Sunday a
2 p.m. Stanford head coach Bobb*
('.lark said that, despite their rank
ings, the Cardinal is takingits op
ponents seriously.
"We try and give every tean
the respect that they deserve, be
cause every team on our schedulr
is good unless we prove other
wise," Clark said. "With two team,
coming from out of region this wil
be a very tough weekend. The'

are two teams thai have a lot of ex
perience and who are very well
coached. It will be a big test for us."
Seton Hall comes into Friday's
game losing only to No. 3 Connecti
cut, No. 4 St John's in overtime, and
No. 15 Pittsburgh. Yet, much like
Stanford, in the Pirates' five wins
this season they have significantly
outscored their opponents, 14-3.
Despite losing key players last
year, the Pirates return this season
with an experienced squad. One
notable player is forward Greg
Strohmann, a preseason All-Big
East selection and possible Ail-
American Candidate. Yet Stan
ford junior midfielder Derek
Shanahan has faith in the style of
play that has brought them
through the first seven games of
the season.
"As far as preparing for this
weekend's game, we will do what
is always done," Shanahan said.
"Our team focus will slay on how
we play our game. 11 we do the
things right that make us a good
team — defend well as a team and
play simply and quickly when we
have the ball — then the result we
want will follow.
"We don't change our plan ac
cording to whatever team it is
we're pla\ ing. We stick behind oui
own pliilosophv and work ethic."
As lor Sunday's game, the

Bearcats come to New Maloney
Field with a deceiving 2-f>-l
record. ()f their six losses, live were
In a diHerence of one goal includ
ing two in overtime. One of their
wins was against Xavier, a team
thai Stanford beat in the first game
of the season.

"Scion liall and Cincinnati will
both be very tough opponents,"
said sophomore defender Todd
Dunivant. "These games will be a
very good test before we get into
the heart of our schedule and a
couple more good results will let
the rest of the country know that
we are for real this year."
So far i Ins season the Cardinal
has put up some very impressive
numbers. In seven games they
have ou(scored opponents 29-1,
outshot opponents 142-47 and
had a total of 1 1 different players
score at least one goal.
"Obviously we are pleased with
our current situation, but we real
ize that we have not put together a
stellar performance fora lull '.)()
minutes," said senior forward
Corey Woolfblk, the team's sec
ond-leading goal scorer. "We've
had Hashes of brilliance as a team,
but it's far from what we know we
can show. Playing home and away
against [conference] teams is going
to be .i tough challenge as we must
have one of the most competitive
conferences in the country, |butj
we're ready for it."
Tonight will be the first oppor
tunity for the Cardinal to play in
front of its home crowd, which is
something that Clark has been
looking forward to.
"We've played one game at
home and the students were not on
campus at that time," said (Hark. "I
think the most exciting thing about
this weekend is that we have a
c hance to play in front of our own
students. I fopefulh we'll get a good
turnout."
