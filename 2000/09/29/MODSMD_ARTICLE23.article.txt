# Lewis tries to weather Wildcat 'D'

### MATT LONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last season, the University <>l Arizona loot ball
squad proved themselves to be the nation's most
underachieving team. Lxpectations ran high with
the quarterback tandem ol Keith Smith and ()r
-tege Jenkins, assisted by a talented
defense. Considered Pad lie 10 C.onlerence fa
vorites and ranked in the top live nationally as the
1999 season commenced, the Wildcats finished .1
disappointing 3-5 in the conference and (>-(> over
all.
The Wildcats (2-1) face much diflerent expecta
tions Saturday when they arrive at Stanford Stadi
um to face the Cardinal (2-1, 1-0 Pac-10). Last yeai
in Tucson, an unheralded Stanford scjuad crushed
Arizona 50-22. After a dismal season, Arizona is at
tempting to establish itsell as a Pac-10 powei once
again. Led by a stilling defense, the Wildcats beat
Utah and San Diego Stale both with the score ol 1 7-
'L They also played well against Ohio State, even
tually losing 27-17.

you have to start with their defense. Willingham

knows that the Arizona defense
will be calling lots of stunts in an
attempt to shake up his nerves
" and produce turnovers.

"You've got a young Qli,'
Lewis said. "That seems to be tlu
thing to do is to bring a lot of pres
sure at the youngster."
Arizona coach Dick Tomey re
alizes that Lewis's sudden thrust
into the spotlight does not take
anv pressure off the Wildcats' de
fense to perform. Tomey heavily
recruited Lewis out of
Beach Poly High School and ex
pects great things out of Stan
ford's young star.
"(Ihris Lewis coming in doesn't
effect our game," Tomey said.
"He continues the long tradition
of great Stanford quarterbacks."
Tomev's secondary will have
its hands full with the Cardinal's
blossoming receiving corps, led
by senior DeKonnie Pitts. I wo
weeks ago against Texas, Pitts
scored the final touchdown,
putting the Cardinal ahead lot
good. Lewis will also look to red
shirt junior tight end Russell

Stewart, who taught three passes
fora career-high K l 2 yards against
the longhonÂ»s during his first
game of the season.
The (Cardinal also hopes to du
plicate the defensive sticcess it
had against Texas, lis hard hit
ting shut down the Longhorn re
ceivers and allowed Stanford to
dominate the secondary while
the defensive line's quickness
obliterated Texas' ground game.
But Arizona and Jenkins'
scrambling style will present dif
ferent challenges than than Texas
quarterback Major Applewhite
and his pocket passing.
Cardinal linebacker Riall
Johnson, who leads the team with
five sacks, said the defense has
prepared for Jenkins' mobility.
"Jenkins can scramble and
then pass on the run real well,"
Johnson said. "He's an athlete
back there, we need to keep him
contained around the edges. Ari

zona's offensive line has trouble
when teams blitz. They're not that
big but they can move real well.
We should be able to get to the
quarterback."
A smaller offensive line should
give senior All-American defen
sive tackle Willie Howard plent\
of chances to hit Jenkins and stop
the run of Arizona's freshman
tailback Clarence Farmer. After
lining up against Texas' offensive
front, the largest in the nation,
Howard should cause fits with
Arizona.
Both teams will be coming out
of bye weeks, so the players will be
anxious to get back on the field.
And, with an extra week of prepa
ration under their pads, the two
teams will know each other well.
" The bye is coming at a great
time," Willingham said. "It gives
us a chance to get our feet back on
the ground and be ready to play
an outstanding football team."
