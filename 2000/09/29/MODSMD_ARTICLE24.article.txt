After an unexpected 4-2 loss to lie No.
19 Santa (.lara Broncos last weekend, the
Cardinal's national ranking seen* to be
the only iliing that suffered.
Instead of viewing last weekend's loss
as an indication <»i its weakness, theNo. 13
Cardinal (0-3) has chosen to use it ;h;i tool
for its success.

" Things were almost going too easily
for us," said head coach Andy Nelson.
"The [Santa Clara] game was like a wake
up call for us."
The Cardinal took the early part < »l its
season by storm, climbing to a No. 5 na
tional ranking and beating three top-20
nationally ranked teams. Its only loss was
by 2-1 in overtime against the currently
top-ranked Notre Dame. The Cardinal
seemed to be safely on its way to another

successful season.
"Our learning curve seemed to have
leveled oil'before the Santa Clara game
but things have been diilereni this week.
There has been a lot that we have been
able to work on," Nelson said. "We've
gone back to the basics and are working
on the tilings that made us successful be
fore."
In its loss to the Broncos, the Cardinal
was able to identilv defensive weaknesses,
and it has spent much of the past week
working to improve the lapses defensively.
"We looked over the films this week
and we could see what we did wrong dur
ing the game," said junior defender Ann
Sauer. "Three of the lour goals were defi
nitely avoidable. I here were things ilut
we could work on, th.it we did work on
this week in practice."
The Cardinal will capitalize on the
progress cultivated in practice this week as
it prepares to face No. 17 Wake Forest ((>-
2) tonight at 112) p.m. and unranked Weber
State (0-8) on Sunday at noon in New Mal
oney Field.
I he defensive progress the Cardinal
has made this week will be particularly im
portant in its first game against the
Demon Deacons, who promise a strong
offensive attack.
Wake Forest boasts the talent of two
strikers in particular, junior Emily lag
gart and sophomore Joline Charlton.
Taggart, a pie-season All-American, has
tallied three goals and three assists this
season. Charlton was named A(XRookie
of the Year last year and has scored four
goals and recorded two assists this season.

rely on the leadership and ex

this weekend, including senior
midfielders and co-captains
Shauna Itri and Christy

players will help lead the team
defensively: Sauer and senior
goalkeeper Carly Smolak.

Weber State appears to be less of a
challenge for the Cardinal. But,
with the end of the non-confer
ence season approaching, Stan
lord will try to maintain its already
impressive record.
"We certainly don't want to un
derestimate them," Nelson said.
"We have to treat every team, I
don't care who they are, with
equal respect."
Because both games are non
conference games, the results from
the weekend will be significant for
the Cardinal in its postseason
NCAA seedings. The Pacific 10
Conference will be particularly
sensitive to postseason rankings
and non-conference records, as six
ol its ten teams currently hold top
-20 rankings.
