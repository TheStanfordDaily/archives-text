Sophomore Peter Hudnut, the Cardinal's second-leading scorer with nine goals this season,
jockeys fora shot in Stanford's 7-4 loss to Cal last Saturday. The Cardinal takes on No 1
USC Saturday at home.
Aquatic Complex, the two will meet
once again in a Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation contest, this time
with the stakes even higher.
I he added challenge isn't that
[USC] is the top-ranked team; it is
that this is a league game," said
head coach Dante Dettamanti.
No. 5 Stanford (5-2, 1-1 MPSF),
which inexplicably dropped three
spots in the polls after a close loss to
No. 4 California and a 15-5 thrash
ing of No. 9 UC-Santa Barbara,
comes into the match with much to
gain — but also to lose — against
the Trojans.

Seeding for ihe MPSF tourna
ment requires a "must-win, all the
time" attitude similar to college
football, and even one more con
ference loss could put the Cardinal
out ol favorable position fora solid
run at the league title.
The last time out against USC,
Stanford trailed 2-0 at half but al
lowed* six third-quarter goals to
drop its first game of the season.
While Dettamanti saw positives in
the second half, including five
scores from his trailing squad, he
said his team simply ran out of gas
in its fourth game in two days.
The powerful Trojans start at
least five foreign-born players, head
lined by Yugoslavian freshman Pe
drag Damjanov. The 6-6, 225-
pound sensation from Belgrade has

tallied 11 goals so far to lead the
team to a perfect 8-0 record.
"He has a lot of moves," said
USC head coach Jovan Vavic. "He
is unstoppable in a one-on-one situ
ation and if teams decide to play
that way with him, he is going to
hurt them."
The Trojans have coasted
through the competition early in
the season, which Dettamanti
called a byproduct of their players'
experience overseas and age ad
vantage over other teams, as most
of the foreign-born players enter
college at an older age than Ameri
can players. He said as the season
wears on, that advantage should
practically disappear.
Dettamanti plans to counter
USC's si/e and ability to wear down

opponents with a game plan set on
fast-breaking with a counterattack
ing defense. The Cardinal will at
tempt to stymie Trojan scoring sets
and move the ball to the other end
of the pool as quickly as possible.
Stanford sophomores Brian
Darrow and Peter Hudnut lead
the scoring fora team that has
found remarkable balance in the
pool this fall. In only seven games,
11 players have recorded at least
one goal, making the Cardinal at
tack threatening no matter who
handles the ball.
"Finally, we are at full strength,"
said Dettamanti of his beleaguered
team in the SoCal Tournaament
final several weeks back. "I feel very
confident that we can beat USCthis
time around."
