SYDNEY, Australia (AP) — So why was
ken i Walsh smiling?
The U.S. women's volleyball team had

hopes for an Olympic gold medal. It
should have been a heart-wrenching de
feat.
"I had fun tonight." said Walsh, an out
side hitter for the U.S. team who graduat-

Ed from Stanford in June. "I was hoping
lor a better outcome, but they were very
fun to play."
And the Americans still get a chance to
take home a prize.
"'doming out of here with any kind of
medal is a bonus," said Stanford sopho
more Logan Tom, one of the Americans'
most important players. "Bronze, gold, sil

ver, whatever — we're fighting our hearts
out for it."
Some of the Americans were having
more fun than others. Tara dross-Bat tie,
32, and Danielle Scott, 27, are the oldest
members of the team and the only ones
who were in Atlanta when the United
States was favored to win the gold and took
seventh.

For them, playing lor the bronze against
Brazil on Saturday (Friday night PDF)
won't be a letdown.
"We're not done yet," Scott said. "I
think it would be awesome for volleyball. A
bronze medal, it's a medal. It's top three,
and would be a good finish for our pro
gram."
The I .S. team did well just to make the

quarterfinals. 1 hen it beat South Korea in
live games belore taking on the Russians,
the tallest team in the tournament.

Alter staging a thrilling come
back to win the fourth game, the
I S. team ran out of steam in the
fifth. The Americans actually led (i

yielding bloc k look over.
"They're a very exceptional
team. I hey have been fora very
long time, said Cross-Baltle. "I in
very proud of ibis leant. A lot of
people didn't think that we would
gel ibis lar, but we knew that we
could."
As in ilicir quarterfinal win. the
Americans stormed back from a
seemingly hopeless deficit.

Russians.
"We had some moments of
greatness," Walsh said."()ur come
back in game four was amazing,
and I think we're going to take that

can't leave anything on the floor."
Scott, 27, took a leave from a
Brazilian pro team to rejoin the na
tional squad. And Cross-Baltle
postponed starting a family. Both
said coining back was well worth it.
"We came here expec ting to win
