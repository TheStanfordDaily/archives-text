ken i Walsh smiling?
The U.S. women's volleyball team had
just lost in live games to Russia, ending
hopes for an Olympic gold medal. It
should have been a heart-wrenching de
feat.
"I had fun tonight." said Walsh, an out
side hitter for the U.S. team who graduat-

Ed from Stanford in June. "I was hoping
lor a better outcome, but they were very
fun to play."
And the Americans still get a chance to
take home a prize.
"'doming out of here with any kind of
medal is a bonus," said Stanford sopho
more Logan Tom, one of the Americans'
most important players. "Bronze, gold, sil

ver, whatever — we're fighting our hearts
out for it."

more fun than others. Tara dross-Bat tie,

members of the team and the only ones

Brazil on Saturday (Friday night PDF)
won't be a letdown.
"We're not done yet," Scott said. "I
think it would be awesome for volleyball. A
bronze medal, it's a medal. It's top three,
and would be a good finish for our pro
gram."
