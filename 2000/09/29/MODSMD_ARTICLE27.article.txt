Last year, Stanford rode to the College World Se
ries on the back of one of the most talented, experi
enced pitching staffs in the country. I his year, the tal
ent might still be there, but the experience will be se
verely lacking.
Senior Jason Young, the- ace of the Stanford staff
Ibr the past two seasons, finally signed a contract with
the Colorado Rockies Monday alter being picked in
the second roundoff une's amateur draft. Young and
the Roc kies had agreed earlier on the terms,of the
monster $2.75 million contract, but made it official
only after the lanky right-hander passed a physical.
"We're excited about Jason as our newest Rocky,"
Josh Byrnes, tlie Assistant General Manager of Col
orado, was quoted as saying. "We think he has a great
opportunity to be aggressive and work hard toward
getting to the big Leagues in a hurry."
According to published reports, the Rockies were
considering pic king Young, who compiled a c areer
record 01'22-f) with a !i.7tt KRA and 327 strikeouts, in
the lirsi round with the seventh pic k overall. 1 lowev
er when high school pitcher Matt Harrington, con
sidered possibly ilie top talent in the draft, slid past
the first six teams because of concerns about how
much money he wanted, the Rockies quickly pic ked
up the power pitcher from Palmdale, Calif.
Young slid down in the draft because of similar
monetary concerns, as well as quest ions about a shoul

der injury he underwent last January. Young is a
client <>l ilie notorious baseball agent Scott Boras,
whose reputation lor hard bargaining is renowned.
The combination ol the two pushed Young down
until the Rockies found that their projected first -
round pic k had fallen into their laps in the second
round.
Despite being the I7ih pic k overall. Young re
ceived an large signing bonus, the
lout th-highest given out this year. I he amount trails
only the $5.3 million given to Stanford teammate Joe
Bore hard by the Chicago White Sox, the $3 million
received b\ No. 1 pick Adrian (Jon/ale/, and the
$2.95 million handed <>ui In the Montreal Kxpos to
another Stanford pitcher. No. ."> pick Justin \\ ayne.
Young signed the contract jtisi two da\s before he
was scheduled to begin < lasses at Stanford. II he had

to sign him, and Young would probablv have re
joined the Stanford team.
As it is, the (Cardinal heads into fall practice li ving
to find three new starlets. While Young and Wayne
departed for the riches of the major leagues, junior
Brian Sager ((>-1 record, 1 S KRA, strikeouts) —
