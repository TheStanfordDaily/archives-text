# Environmental Engineering major debuts
## New program is built on expanded course offerings 
### LAURA COLEMAN 
Ai 20, junior Joanne Yeung is
something of an entrepreneur in
her field. She is the first engineer
ing student to have declared the
new Environmental Engineering
major, which is under the aegis of
the Department of Civil and Envi
ronmental Engineering.
Approved l>\ the Faculty Sen
ate last May and offered for the
first lime this fall, the Environ
mental Engineering major cre
ates a new course of study for un
dergraduates to choose within
the department.
Lynn Hildemann, associate
professor and associate chair of
the Civil <iikl Environmental En

gineering Department, was one
ol the many forces behind the de
partment s decision to offer the
new major. The idea emerged
collaboratively a year and a half
ago at a departmental retreat lo
dising on ways to improve un
dergraduate course offerings.
Hildemann was well aware
that some of her students wished
they had an ability to take more
classes dealing with the environ
ment. She recalls many students
asking, "Why do 1 have to take
this course?" and her response
being, "It's good for your
breadth."
The department has been
moving toward the new major
during this past year with the in
troduction of classes on Human
Exposure Analysis, Aquatic
Chemistry and Biology and an
Introductory Physical Oceanog
raphy class. Most recently the de
partment has introduced a labo

ratory design-oriented class on
Enviromental Biotechnology.
Hildemann said that because
few schools offer an Environ
mental Engineering major,
some — such as UC-Berkeley —
have spoken with her, curious to
learn more about Stanford's new
offering.
Until now the department,
which had 28 declared majors last
fall, offered students studying ('ivil
Engineering two different tracks
from which to choose: the Wet
Track (environmental) or the Dr\
Track (structures and const ruc -
tions). Ihe new Environmental
Engineering major allows students
to loc us more on environmental
topics and less on structures or ge
oteclmical classes.
Environmental Engineering
majors do not need to lake the
structural engineering class, which
teaches them information about
the si/es of beams and columns to

put in buildings, or the geo-techni
cal engineering class. I lowever,
Hildemann still recommends ihe
geo-technical ( lass because ii does
locus on environmental factors
such as pollutants in the soil.
Yeung appreciates the flexibili
ty of the new major because she
now has more options and lime lo
I.ike classes that are pertinent to
her goals.
Asked why she became interest
ed in environmental engineering,
Yeung said she's not an engineer
ing person. She is enthusiastic
about the field because ii "can
solve problems in the world that
are now facing society, such .is
how to deal witli carbon monox
ide in the air."
" There's a phrase that says 'we
don't get the world from our an
cestors, rather n is loaned lo iin
from our next generation," mean
ing. everybody is responsible for
the world," Yeung said.
