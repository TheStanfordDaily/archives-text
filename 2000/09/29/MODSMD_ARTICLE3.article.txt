Brad Osgood, prof, of Electri
cal Engineering and this year's
Senate chair, began the meeting
b\ welcoming the new administra
tion, announcing that he was "of
ficially declaring a honeymoon
period beginning for the presi
dent and the provost."
Speaking rapidly and cracking
jokes, C Xsgood drew praise from his
colleagues. Linguistics Prof. John
Rickford, who is a member of the
Senate's Steering Committee,
noted that Osgood is "very highly
respected as a great teacher, re
searcher and has a great wit, which
will keep us happy" during the
meetings.
Osgood said that there will be a
substantial fix us on the work of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (C-US), which deals with
the undergraduate curriculum and
various undergraduate programs
like the Overseas Studies Program
and Undergraduate Advising.

Religious Studies Prof. Hester
Gelber, in her first report to the
Senate as ( hair of the ( .-US, stat
ed that this is a time to assess the
many changes in the undergrad
uate curriculum in the last lew
years. She explained that it was
time to "get some kind of picture
of the undergraduate experience
and take a pulse" of what has
worked and what still needs im
provement.
Gelber mentioned that among
the curricular changes ih.it will he
discussed this year will be the possi
bility of adding requirements in
ethics, public service learning and
oral presentation. In addition, the
committee will consider how to
fine-tune the Area Four require
ment, which deals with world cul
tures, American cultures and gen
der studies. But she also added that
she wanted to change the curricu
lum in a way that will not make it
more complicated.
Gelber, who has first-hand ex
perience dealing with the new de
velopments in the undergraduate
curriculum through teaching in
the Introduction to ihe Humani
iit's and Freslunan Seminars pro
gram, said after the meeting that
by gathering quantitative data in
ihe form of surveys and other
methods, her committee will be
able to develop a better blueprint
for the future.
Rick ford agreed that under
graduate issues will lie important
during this school year, noting
ih.it it was critical to take a hard
look at adding the service learn
ing requirement and the ethics re
quirement to the undergraduate

curriculum,
ttut lie also said that another
huge issue to be discussed in the
Senate will be an old one â€” the lack
of readily available fatuity housing.
He said that the lack ol housing
would have "academic effects" in
terms of difficulty in recruiting pro
fesst >rs.
When asked how his adminis
tration would cli Her from that of
former University President Cer
hard Casper in terms of its rela
tionship with the Senate and the
fat uity in general, Hennessy stat
ed that, "1 come to the job know
ing a large number of faculty from
all over campus and obviously
tlmt creates a different relation

ship with my colleagues than
when |( lasper] came here."
Speaking alter the meeting ad
journed, junior Serge Kassardjian,
the ASS I Undergraduate Senate
Chair, was optimistic about this
school year, declaring that the
meeting was "very well organized
[and that | we should have an excel
lent several years with President
1 lennessy."
ASSIJ President Setli Newton, a
senior, went into more detail, stat
ing that "we're here to be active par
ticipants ... the academic enter
prise of the Senate is a verv big
role." He said that while "a service
requirement may not necessarily be
the right way to develop public ser

vice at Stanford," he would use lus
influence to convince the Senate
that "public service education
needs a lot more resources and
recc >gnition."
Newton also hopes to open up
discussion with member of the
Senate about the possibility ol
more faculty support for student
initiated courses.
After the meeting was ad
journed, a welcoming reception
was held for the new president
and Senate. Wine glass in hand,
Hennessy stated that in his new
role, he will work in the Senate
and elsewhere "to ensure that the
University remains vibrant and
healthy."
