sion," he said, "ft will provide the

Et<hem*ndy
leading this promising venture."
rhe Alliance will offer non
credit courses io alumni, taking

nologies to give the graduates
convenient access to their
schools' resources.
"Our main goal in this ven
due is to find ways for Stanford
to continue serving the educa
tional needs of its students, even
after they leave campus," said

of Directors. " I he need and de
sire for access to education, and
the resources Stanford has to
oiler, doesn't stop with the re
ceipt of a degree.
l hrough the Alliance, alumni

and interactive seminars; multi

erage oft ampus speakers, exhibi
tions and other events; lectures
011 tape; and other offerings.
"We are delighted to be a part
of this new initiative to expand
the boundaries ol distance learn
ing and provide our alumni with
the experience of intellectual vi
tality that our lour universities
can provide," said University

1 he four member universi
iies hope to explore through the
Alliance the exciting possibilities
that the Internet and other tech
nologies oiler lor teaching and
learning. Where appropriate,
innovations developed by the
Alliance may be incorporated
into the schools' core campus
programs.
The Alliance will work with the
four member universities to solic
it and respond to faculty propos
als for programs and projects that
ihe alumni would find rewarding
and license and distribute them
oil the schools behalf. Rather

than develop its own production
facilities and hire staff, the Al
liance will sub-contract such
needs to the individual universi
ties on a project-by-project basis.
The Alliance will provide new
opportunities for faculty mem
bers to incorporate technology
and collaborate with their peers.
Each university will develop the
terms and conditions ol its own
faculty's involvement in the Al
liance.
"Our two primary objectives
are to provide the best learning
experiences that we can to out
students and alumni and to en
able faculty members to explore
new methods which may enhanct
the teaching and research ihe\
are able to carry out," said Prince
ton President I larold I . Shapiro
"The use ol electronic and
other media oilers the promise ol
extending in exciting new wfy\ s
the University's commitments«t<
develop and disseminate knowl
edge. We want to ensure that ont
faculty and students have the
opportunity it) lake full advan
tage of instructional possibili
lies — and, indeed. It) imagine
and develop new possibilities.'
Shapiro added.
"We believe that a service suj'h
as this — offering access to I he txl
ucational resources of four of the
world's top universities —
have global appeal," saitl Oxford
Vice Chancellor Colin Lucas.
1 he lour universities recogny.t
the potential appeal of the Al
liance's educational opporiunitie>
io non-alumni, and they plan,in
ihe future to make theii
available to a wider audience. J
The Alliance expects to begin
making courses and other prtjd
nets available in the latter part(ol
2001.
The offerings will not be free
however. Users will have to pa\
because developing these sorts'ol
materials is very expensive, 41
cording to Kit heniencly, and ilit
venture would not be feasible oth
erwise. Mow much the universi
ties will charge depends on the
number of users.
