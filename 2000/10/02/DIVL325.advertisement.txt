Anything Is Possible
Th is is where the generation of new ideas lives.
Because we've built a global network of people who see
possibilities where others see confusion and risk — and who
know how to turn those possibilities into realities. And by
working at internet speed — propelling dozens of companies
and millions of investors into the new economy.
We are propelling careers all over the world.
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter invites all seniors interested in our
European Investment Banking Division's analyst program to complete
our on-line application at www.msdw.com/career/recruiting.
(Please note that Graduate Recruitment refers to seniors graduating
from university in 2001.)
Application deadline is October 13, 2000. Authorization to work
within the EU is required.
All interested undergraduates are invited to discuss career
opportunities in our European Investment Banking Division
with our US analyst recruiting team by contacting:
