"The Historical Roots of Modern East Asia"
(History 92A, Fall, 5 credits, Kahn)
Until the end of the 18th century, East Asia
comprised the most populous, urbanized,
economically advanced, and culturally
sophisticated societies in the world. This course
focuses on China, Korea, and Japan in the last
great age before modern times, the 17th through
the early 19th centuries. We will use fiction,
poetry, art, films, and history in order to
understand this complex region on its own terms
