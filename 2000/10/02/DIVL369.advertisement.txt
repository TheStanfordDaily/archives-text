OCTOBER PERFORMANCES
Western Opera Theater
Die Fledermaus
Friday, October 6, 8:00 p.m.
Memorial Auditorium
A cheating wife, a jealous husband, lax evasion—a contemporary scandal? Not exactly Die
Fledermaus is Strauss' frothy soap operetta of 19th century Vienna. Western Opera Theater,
San Francisco Opera's national touring company, complete with full orchestra, concocts a mix
of sumptuous voices, fabulous sets, and a lively score. Overhead subtitles in English guaran
tee you won't miss any of the fun. The San Francisco Chronicle declares this is "on extraordi
narily bubbly and well-sung production of Die Fledermaus."
