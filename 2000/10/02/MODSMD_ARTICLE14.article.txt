1970
On Oct. 2, 1970, The Daily published
an article called "Non-Violent House
Opens Doors" about the former Chi Psi
fraternity house undergoing a dramatic
change.
"Every evening at 5:30 a small group as
sembles in the living room of the former
Chi Psi fraternity house fora half hour of
quiet meditation. ()utside, a man lies in the
gl ass lapping out a soft rhythm on a bongo
drum while a young woman moves silently
through yoga's contorted positions.
"... The fall (llii I'si pie fight now exists
only as part of this house's creamy past.
Rush, 'hell week' and the Saturday night
fraternity party have moved into a smaller
house on campus along with what once
was a r>o-man Chi Psi contingent.
"Cone too are the Greek letters â€” the
(llii Psi house is now the (lolumbae
1 louse."
Bottom Line: From pie fights to yoga, meditation
and bongo drums. Let tnis be a warning to all
fraternities left at Stanford.
