a total of 29 in three days <>l
bloodshed over a contested

tions instead of new ideas on
how to solve their disputes.
In an ominous sign of escala
tion across the West Bank and

anti-tank missiles, hurled
grenades and shot from heli
copter gunships. Several Israeli

gunships swooped clown and
unleashed ;i barrage of lire,
sending hundreds ol Palestini
ans fleeing lor cover. I he army
said the helicopters were
brought in to rescue the wound

was retained by Israel after it
