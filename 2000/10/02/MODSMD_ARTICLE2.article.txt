# Stanford made simple
## 
### JIMMY WU 
Those frustrating days of logging onto
http://www.stanford.edu and frantically
searching for essential features such as
YVhois, student activity home pages and
Stanford news are finally over.
Just in time for the start of the school
year, the Technology Group of Stanford
Student Enterprises launched its new
My. Stanford Web site
(http://my.stantord.edu) Sept. 22.
The Web site is modeled very closely
alter the My.Yahoo Web site, allowing its
users to control their own environment .i

easily.
For example, users
may select types of news
headlines. They may
even specifically choose

the theme which the page will display

"My.Stanford puts all of Stanford's on
line resources in one place and offers many
other useful and fun features," said summer
programming group leader Kathryn
Chinn.
Senior Ross Davisson, the technology
group director of SSE, said the idea of cre
ating the My.Stanford Web site originated,
because the group believed that many im
portant resources were very difficult to find
on the original Stanford Web site.
As part of the planning process, the
Technology Group took student input and
had several students test out the site's fea
tures.
"As students ourselves, [SSE] related to
the student body more, and that provided
us with the inspiration to design a site for
the students," Davisson said.
When students first log into the My.Stan
ford Web site, they will immediately find the
popular Google search engine and links to
Stanford-related pages including a campus
map, the ASSU, SSE, the Bookstore and
Axess.

Also available is a computerized version
of "The Unofficial Guide to Stanford," Stan
ford newsgroups, national and local news
and updated weather forecasts.
"The My.Stanford site is very useful he
cause it introduces new and previously
hard-to-access features of Stanford by
bringing them to the forefront," sophomore
Travis Tarr said.
l he My.Stanford team has a positive out
look about where the site will be in the fu
ture. â€¢

"I hope that many more people dis
cover the site and find it useful," Davis
son said. "I hope it will be around for

a very long
time."

The team eventu

ally hopes to create more options

that allow better control, faster service and a
more community-like environment.
The project coordinators also wish to ex
pand the portal so that students will be able
to advise their peers on housing, courses
and other areas of interest.
"1 think this Web site is a great idea, be
cause it gives the students convenient access
to anything Stanford-related," freshman
Puja Kohli said. "I hope that the site will
continue to improve and grow."
In addition to Davisson, juniors Jason
Glickman and Cyrus Khambatta were also
instrumental in the planning and designing
ol the Web site over the past year.
During the summer, Chinn led a pro
gramming team that consisted of sopho
more Keith Ito (also a Daily photo editor),
junior Reid Gustin, junior Tom Stripling
and junior Huy Nguyen.
This fall, a new team, anchored by Davis
son and senior manager Kim Chen, will
work to maintain and improve the quality ol
the site and the service it provides.
