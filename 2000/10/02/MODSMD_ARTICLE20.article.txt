## 'Farm-sick' in Sydney 
### EMILY DRESSEL GUEST COLUMNIST 
There's that famous line that says
\<>u don't know what you have
until it\ gone. I'oday I opened
the Stanford photo aibuin that I
had smashed in tin suitcase, last minute,
.iikl draped thousands of miles to the
southern hemisphere.
1 hadn't glanced .it it before this after
noon. For three months, it s.n there, t.ik
ing up precious spate on mv close! shelf,
not making a peep, a rustle or showing
an\ othei sign of existence.
I was beginning to feel like a Idol lot
lugging the stupid tiling abroad.
Alter all, I was here to meet new peo
ple. travel, explore m\ independence, lap
up .ill kinds of "lile experiences.": discov
ei who I was and where I was going.
It was the cookie-cutter junior year
abroad thai evervone is so excited to
undertake.
I he best semester of vour lile. A non
stop part v. Classes? A joke. "Co ahead,
leave Stanford." evervone ( bants.
Yet . . .
I'm here now. I have immersed mvsell
in the < ultlire: snorkeled the Ciieat Ban i
ei Keel, slathered Vegimile on m\ toast,
bought my token Svdne\ touristx I-shirt,
hugged .i kaola. ( limbed Harbor Bridge,
taste-tested even brand ol Aussie beer,
plaved rugb\ on the beat h. attempied the
accent and even added "No worries" to
tn\ vocabularv.
I have had the time ol m\ life.
So whv. then, did I leel <» pang?
Why, when I went to check nn e-mail
this morning down at the local I-cafe, did
I flinch?
I here were several reasons: A note
Irom the (lass presidents about junior
night .it the Collo. ()ne from a guy from
in\ freshman dorm inviting the list to a

bash at Sigma Chi. And a bunch from
friends, just beginning to get settled in,
telling me who they bumped into, who
looks good, who was a jerk and just how
bad the Idod is in Stern.
It felt odd. I lelt like a stranger.
It was as though I never expected life
at Stanford to go on without me. I didn't
actually realize I'd be missing out — that
there would be basketball games and bike
accidents and Frost\ Mints at the Collo
and thai I wouldn't be there lot them.
Ii was the first lime being abroad
didn't leel so glamourous, so superior to
Stanford.
I missed Stanford and wanted it back.
All of it.
I was probabh in the most celebrated
(itv in (lie world .11 that moment, with all
eves 011 Australia and the Sydney
Olympic Cames.
I was in the midst of all the drama,
glor\ and scandal — a twenty-minute bus
t ide away from the ()pera I louse steps, a
hall-hour train ride from Michael |olm
son and the (Mynipic track.
Bui all I wanted to do was go home
and pull out the old photo album. I need
ed to remember.
And as I Hipped through the pages,
colored with snapshots ol ski trips, (razv
house meetings, lootball games, clubs in
San Fran and sin prise birthday parties
all familiar places and laces, gidch and
laughing — all I could do was smile and
think, "those were the davs."
Mavbe I did need to go abroad. Maybe
the (banting voices were right. Mavbe I
needed to separate mvscl! and be awa\ lor
a while — not just to explore new hori
zons, bill It) have a gentle reminder thai
the old horizons really weren't all that bad.
