New ideas for Dish
I think Stanford's new environmental
polio in the Dish area is fantastic. M\
onl\ suggestions for improvement are
the following:
• More "No I respassing and "Private
Propertx" throughout the lulls,
• An electrified barbed wire feme
around the entire area and
• Strategically plated guard towers
with searchlights and armed guards on
24-hour duty.
I'd also like to see the I ni\ersit\ take on
administration <>1 other heavilv used areas
like the (irand (ianvon and Yosemite Val
lev. Let's get these places paved over and
under control before it's too late.

Cows an environmental problem
in the Foothills
I lit' List sentence ol vout editorial did
not mention the environmental impact of
the cows and horses that graze on sub
stantial disk acreage.
Ihe cows trample plant seedlings,
cause erosion and pollution to a degree
lilt greater than any amount of human or
dog use. Why are they there anywav? Lo
make money for Stanford?
You ma\ wish to point to this as fur
ther evidence <>l Stanford's disingenuous
stand and their hvpocrisy.
