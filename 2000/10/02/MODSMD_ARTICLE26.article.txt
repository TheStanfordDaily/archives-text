interceptions. Lewis hesitated to
throw, holding on to the ball in the
pc K'ket.
Lewis' hesitation allowed the
Arizona pass rush to disrupt his
rhythm and lore ed him to cone en
trate on avoiding incoming Wild
cats rather than hitting open re
ceivers. flic ellectiveness of Ari
zona's hard-nosed defensive line
was evident later in the game,
when Lewis rarely ventured out of
the pocket.
"I obviously didn't play up to
ni\ capabilities," said Lewis. "I'm
young and I know they're going to
bring a lot at me. I just look lor
ward to getting back to practice
and working on the little things;
staving calm, keeping ni\ compo
sure and making the throws I need
to make."
Alter overthrowing receivers on
his first three passes, Lewis lircd
over the middle and was intercept

turned the ball to the Stanford 22.

pressure on the defense was too

"We didn't execute well, and
