Inconsistency is quickh becom
ing the norm lor the Stanlbrcl loot
ball team.
Alter a decisive opening win
against Washington State, the (Car
dinal lost to lovvlv San |ose State.
But the Cardinal (2-2, i-1 l'ac-10)
bounced back to defeat lexas,
ranked No. 5 .it the time, behind
the strong pla\ of redshirt fresh
man (|iiarterback ('.lnis l.ewis and
a crushing defense.
Based on the (Cardinal's impres
sive performance against l exas,
expectations were high when the
Arizona Wildtats (3-1,1-0) anive<l
at Stanford Stadium on Saturday.
I fowever, Stanford could not keep
its composure in a 27-3 blowout
loss. With six turnovers, the (Cardi
nal's oflense forced the defense to
endure the sweltering heat with lit
tle lime to rest between the next Ar
ti/ona onslaught.
Speech Arizona freshman
(Clarence Farmer followed his line
to 130 yards rushing and one
touchdown, unintimiclaled In
Stanford's vaunted "Trench
Dogs."

Lewis, replacing injured red
shirt junior Ranch Fasani, showed
Ins age, completing I I of 32 passes
completed lor 177 yards and two
interceptions. Lewis hesitated to
throw, holding on to the ball in the
pc K'ket.
Lewis' hesitation allowed the
Arizona pass rush to disrupt his
rhythm and lore ed him to cone en
trate on avoiding incoming Wild
cats rather than hitting open re
ceivers. flic ellectiveness of Ari
zona's hard-nosed defensive line
was evident later in the game,
when Lewis rarely ventured out of
the pocket.
"I obviously didn't play up to
ni\ capabilities," said Lewis. "I'm
young and I know they're going to
bring a lot at me. I just look lor
ward to getting back to practice
and working on the little things;
staving calm, keeping ni\ compo
sure and making the throws I need
to make."
Alter overthrowing receivers on
his first three passes, Lewis lircd
over the middle and was intercept
ed by junior Alex Luna, who re
turned the ball to the Stanford 22.
After tlu- liist of Stanford's si\
tin novel s, the defense made a red
zone stop and Arizona's Scan Keel
kicked a 30 vard field goal.
I wo minutes later Arizona
quarterback ()rtege Jenkin s, a se
nior, found a wide-open Brad
Brennan lor a 3(">-yard tone lidown

pass, bringing the score to 10-0 for
Arizona.
On the next Stanford drive, ju
nior Kasey Moore coughed up the
ball to the Wildcats. I he Cardinal
defense held Arizona to a .''if)-yard
field goal on the drive. Hut the
pressure on the defense was too
much when Stanford again fum
bled on the lii st play of the second

quarter, setting up a 43 yard
Jenkin s pass to sophomore Bobby
Wade and a three yard touchdown
dive In Farmer, making the hall
time score 20-0.
