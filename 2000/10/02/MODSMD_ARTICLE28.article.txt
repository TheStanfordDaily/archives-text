.Although the top-ranked
schools like Arkansas and Wiscon
sin boasted impressive individual
performances this weekend, Stan

tr\ is definitely a team sport with
llnee runners finishing together.
"We ran very well as a team,"
said team captain Klena \ illareal.

te.im, and it's also very earl\ in the
season, I believe out overall perfor
mance todav demonstrates we are a
C(>hesive unit."

an impressive 20 second personal
record. Such an improvement
this early in the season implies
there is much to be anticipated as
nationals near and the season
progresses.
"Flena ran a very strong rate,"
said assistant coach Dena Fvans.
"She is a great leader and captain,

and was a great example for our
freshmen who also ran well, Jill
and Victoria."
Impressive individual perfor
mances by freshmen Victoria
Chang (eighth) and Jillian Mas
troianni (12th), also demonstrates
there is a great deal ol potential in
this fail l\ young team.
Chang demonstrated she was
both a team plaver and tough com
petitor by running well with Vil
lareal and Sullivan in the top three
Stanford spots.
Mastroianni was on target in
terms of her times at the I - and 2-
milc marks and finished strong
with a powerful kick down the
straight-away of the course.

"The heat affected me a bit in
the middle," said Mastroianni, "but
I finished well and gave it my all in
the end."
(iiving it all in the end was a
common theme in Saturday's 27th

the Cardinal, this invitational pro
