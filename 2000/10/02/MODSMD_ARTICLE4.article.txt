# Loague wins teaching prize
## 
### LOUISA HANDLE 
Always eager to work with un
dergraduates, (ieological and Envi
ronmental Sciences Prof. Keith
Loague arrived at Junior (lon vexa
tion in Memorial Church last
Wednesday expecting an evening
of visiting with and recruiting stu
dents.
But to his surprise, Stephan (ira
ham, professor of geological and
environmental sciences, an
nounced that 1 .< >ague wast his year's
recipient of the Laurance and
Naomi Carpenter Hoagland Prize
lor Undergraduate reaching.
Each spring, sophomores nomi
nate outstanding professors lor the
prize. The dean of humanities and
sciences confers with the depart
ment chairs and the deans of earth
sciences and engineering before
choosing the recipient. In keeping
with tradition, Loague was not
aware in advance that he was re
ceiving the award.
"1 had no idea. I was totally sur
prised <ind delighted," said Loague,
who also received the Award for Ex
cellence in Leaching in the School
of Earth Sciences in 1997. Loague
will donate the $7,000 stipend he
received to his department's "Soil
1 fydrology Gift Fund."
"1 like working with the under
graduates. Students at Stanford are
great. I write lots of letters of rec
ommendation, and it's really easv
because they all are so good," said
Loague, who also serves as an un-

Dei graduate advisor.
Next quarter he will teach geo
logical and Environmental Sciences
43N: "Environmental Problems,"
which is a Stanlbrd Introductory
Studies seminar

covering topics
including acid
rain, the Alaska
pipeline and oil
(anker spills.
"I can't be
lieve 1 get paid to
do this," said
Loague, a native
of Royal Oak,

M ich." 11's awc mderfi il < >pp< >rt unity
to get paid to do something I would
want todoanvwav. It's a privilege to
get to work with the students at
Stanford.
"I never thought of myself as [be
coming] a teacher during my un
dergraduate days," Loague added,
remembering his time in the School
of Natural Resources at the Univer
sity of Michigan at Ann Arbor.
Loague's interest in hydrology
grew out of a conversation he had as
an undergraduate with a hydrolo
gist in the Forest Service in Col
orado. 112 le was intrigued by the idea
that math applied to physics could
help solve environmental prob
lems.
Loague studies landslides and
ground water contamination, creat
ing models to simulate environ
mental problems and then per


Loague
forming licit I work to support the
data. Mis studies are "process
based." aiming to provide data use
ful lor decision management.
"We just try to do good work to
understand the processes" so tli.it it
will be p< >ssible to "make bet let (let i
sions relating to the environment,"
he said.
Melissa Mills, a co-terminal stu
dent in earth systems, said she ap
preciates I.(>ague\ enthusiasm.
I le hooked me, savs Mills. "I le
got me down this path and I was ex
cited to lind something that I was
passionate about, lie's rcalh down
to earth, a hart! worker who takes
time to prepare lectures and help
students."
Mills joined others in her depart

Loague and listening to letters from
students praising him.
Loague shared credit lor his suc

hvtlrogeologN group at Stanford."
