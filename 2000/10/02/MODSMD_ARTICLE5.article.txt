ginning last year, the program lor top admitted fresh
men doubled its payout from $1,500 to $3,000 per stu
dent.
This year's 02 scholars are encouraged to use their
allocated grants to pursue any intellectual interest they
may have — from studying the origins of opera in
Italy to investigating language acquisition in infants.
"Each recipient is awarded an Intellectual Explo
ration Grant of $3,000 to lie used before the beginning
of the junior year," said Laura Selznick, director of Un
dergraduate Research Opportunities.
Past award recipients have used their grants in a va
riety of ways.
Junior Leah Barrera used two-thirds of her funding
to investigate changes in the Philippine educational
system and how such changes led to the emergence of
a national consciousness during the last 35 years of
Spanish colonial rule.
"Stanford truly fosters the intellectual excitement
and independence of its students by having such faith
in their ability to develop their own research pursuits
within their first two years as undergraduates," she
said.
Although Ban era's research project was unrelated
to her major, math and computational science, lor oth
ers, like junior Alison Bjerke, the research projects are
relevant to their courses ol study.
"I will probably write a thesis in [the Religious Stud-
ies| Department," said Bjerke, who
spent part of her summer analyz
ing tlie*prophetic texts ol the ()ld
Testament through historical-crit
ical lenses, Bjerke used all $.'{.ooo
of her funding plus a minor grant.
" The experience and the siud\
were phenomenal. 1 led like this
summer is the lirst time I've ever
read those prophetii lexis with an\

understanding. It was amazing,"
Bjerke said.
The program prides tisell on
identifying Stanford's most promis
ing admitted students, those who
demonstrate unusual ability, < u
riosity, insight and initiative.
" The President s Scholars
Award is merely meant to give

start on their Stanford education,'
Sel/.nick said.
"Ii must be noted that Presi
dent's Si holar Awards are only one
wav of receivinii grant funding. All
