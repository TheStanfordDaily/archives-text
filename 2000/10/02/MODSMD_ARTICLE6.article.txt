# Unmasking the mascot: a look at this year's Tree
## 
### BRIAN EULE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Friday alternoon and the Stanford
Band has a 3:30 call for rehearsal
A.T.S., or "at the Shak." Alex Newell
sits outside, trying to get any sun she
can lor her pale, been-in-England
for-far-too-long skin. She wears a
brown vest over a bright blue-striped
shirt, a tiny cowboy hat that looks like
something out of Howdy Doody on
her head and long down pants that
cover the legs of her 6-foot-2 frame
with pink, purple, orange and yellow
stripes.
She looks like a cartoon character.
And she's trying desperately to ex
plain how she has gotten here, mum
bling something about a long line ol
mascots in her family. Something
about the Michelin Man.
Your grandfather?
"Great grandfather," she says. "Get
it right."
She continues.
"My grandfather was the Riben
aberry."
Pause.
"Capital T in the,' please," she
says.
She continues.
"My great uncle was Chirpy. My
dad was very sad he didn't get to be a
mascot, so he sent my brother, sister

and I to mascot camp. |Mv sister]
came home crying, but it worked for
m) brother and me. My brother is the
banana in the Fruit of the Loom ads.
"And now, here I am," she adds
with a smile.
She is lying. All of it.
Nobody in her family was ever a
mascot, and nobody in her family un
derstood why she wanted to become
Stanford's free. Her cousin told her
to get on ii plane back to England re
cently, because she had obviously
been in America foi ioo long.
While Newell sits outside, the I ree
costume rests against one of the
longer walls in the small, rectangular
room at the back of Stanford's Band
Shak. ()pposite the costume, another
wall is covered in an assortment of col
ors, paint impressions of the breasts of
past Stanford Dollies adorned with
their autographs. Below and to the
right of the impressions, leaning up
near the room's entrance, a green sign
from Merrill Street hides behind a
large blue street sign taken from
Newell Road.
The costume itself looks a bit Jimp
with no one inside. Its long eyelashes
droop, its luscious lips sag. The white
hat weighed down with far too many
buttons, atop its head, leans forward.


EMILY PRINCE/The Stanford Daily File
Alex Newell, this year's Tree, stands with a group of Tree hopefuls last year.
Its a hat that crashed through a
Stern Hall window, last week,
when Newell finally took her cos
tume fora lest run.
Newell has long had a secret
love affair with the l ree, ever since
she came to Stanford to play vol
leyball three years ago. But it's not
because of the lame, and it's not be
cause of the ego trip. It's certainly
not because of any 112 amily history.
It's because of — deep breath
here — the children.
Granted, this is a hard pill to
swallow. It's sappy, corny or any
other adjective used to describe
explanations that usually bring
about nausea. But there is some
truth to it.
Newell's eyes light up as she
talks about the kids who came to
Stanford's volleyball games din ing
her freshman year and how they
always seemed more interested in
the mascot than in the game. 1 his
time, she's not lying.
.You shrug it off, you laugh at
her, but you know she is speaking
the truth. And there she is. in that
fluffy Free costume at the Stan
ford-Arizona football game,
pressed up against the chain-link
fence designed to hold back the
throngs of people that are absent
from the game, talking to three
wide-eyed children.
Perhaps you believe her be
cause Newell has always been into
pleasing others, putting smiles on
their faces with her optimistic and
caring approach. Or perhaps it is

because she is one big kid herself,
the kind of person who would try
to convince you that she spent
years training to be Tree in a mas
cot camp. More than likely, it's a
combination of the two.
Her energy level is a bit as
tounding. Heading up a "late
night posse" freshman year,
Newell would sit in the dorm's hall
way, writing in her journal and
talking to anyone else awake, any
one who would pass by, between
the hours of 2 and 4 in the morn
ing. She wanted to surrounded
by people. Only after all the other
night owls went to bed would she
star! her papers.
Sometimes she would bounce
around the halls, giggling like a
schoolgirl. At other times, she
seemed far older than her years,
comforting friends adjusting to the
same struggles that she was dealing
with herself. Only they didn't
know the half of it.
For Newell, it was a culture
shock. She had not spent much
time in the I nited States, but she
figured there wouldn't be much of
a language problem.
She was wrong.
"1 think die biggest shock, when
1 got here, was that nobody under
stood me," she said. "Honestly, I
would speak whole paragraphs,
and they wouldn't understand a
word. It was really disturbing."
Oh, bollix ks.
Now, after the Stanford experi
ence, she speaks an odd combina
tion of California!) and Knglish
slang.
"Most people aren't sporty," she
says of her homeland. "There's a
reason IwhyJ we only have six

medals [in ihe (Mympics this year].
I mean, come on. dude," she adds,
like a local beach bum.
Alter three years at Stan lord,
Newell has covered more ground
in her activities than most stu
dents. The list includes being a
member of Stanford'B NCAA
championship volleyball team, a
resident assislant in an all-fresh
man dorm, a KZSU radio an
nouncer and now, Stanford's first
female Free in 15 years.
"I've always watched the Band
and loved it," Newell says."I
helped two of my best friends in
out tor Tree in two consecutive
years, [so] 1 just got the idea I could
do it and it just wouldn't go away.
Then, 1 started thinking about it
seriously.
"Then, I told my parents and 1
stopped thinking about it serious
ly," she says.
Newell was told she was crazy.
1 ler senior year would finally bring
some time for herself.
Alter a turbulent time on the
women's volleyball team, bogged
down with injuries and little play
ing time, she left the team during
her sophomore year. It was just in
time to free up her life to become a
resident assistant. So, it wasn't until
the day of the meeting 1< >r 1 ree t ry
outs that Newell decided she
would run.
Then, she told her freshman
residents.
"They were really psyched," she
said. "It was the most awesome
feeling. It was like I won it. I said to
them. Tin just trying out.' "
Newell pauses. A downward
glance reveals her toenails are
painted green.

Suddenly, .ill the people Newell
spent years listening to and mak
ing smile were helping make her
the first foreign Tree, as far as any
one can recall, in Stanford Band
history.
"She just attracts a lot of peo
ple," says senior Lauren Robert
son, Newell's roommate of two
years. "People were willing to
help her out. She has a large
group of 112 riends.
"Plus, everyone's a sucker for
that English accent."
So, after stunts that included
women bonne ingon a trampoline

in White Plaza for 24 hours and
almost her entire dorm backing
her up in an elaborate dance to
"Thriller" amid Hay Area fog,
Newell's dream came true.
It didn't take long for word of
Newell's new position to travel
across the Bay. It didn't take long
for UC-Bei kele\ to begin buzzing
about Big Game. Four years ago,
at Cal, the Free was destroyed
after the game by a mob of stu
dents. Two years ago, Cal stu
dents stole the costume out ol the
old Band Shak.
1 "his year, Big Came talis on

Newell's 22nd birthday.
"I know they're going to try
something. I don't know what,
but I've heard from too many
Berkeley people who told me
they're excited that I'm a girl,"
Newell says. "They think I'm easy
pit king."
I hey probably don't know her
energy level.
They probably don't know how
many people will be backing her
up.
I hey probably lorgot that
everyone's a sucker for that Eng
lish accent.
