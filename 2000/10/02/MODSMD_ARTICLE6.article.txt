# Unmasking the mascot: a look at this year's Tree
## 
### BRIAN EULE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Friday alternoon and the Stanford
Band has a 3:30 call for rehearsal
A.T.S., or "at the Shak." Alex Newell
sits outside, trying to get any sun she
can lor her pale, been-in-England
for-far-too-long skin. She wears a
brown vest over a bright blue-striped
shirt, a tiny cowboy hat that looks like
something out of Howdy Doody on
her head and long down pants that
cover the legs of her 6-foot-2 frame
with pink, purple, orange and yellow
stripes.
She looks like a cartoon character.
And she's trying desperately to ex
plain how she has gotten here, mum
bling something about a long line ol
mascots in her family. Something
about the Michelin Man.
Your grandfather?
"Great grandfather," she says. "Get
it right."
She continues.
"My grandfather was the Riben
aberry."
Pause.
"Capital T in the,' please," she
says.
She continues.
"My great uncle was Chirpy. My
dad was very sad he didn't get to be a
mascot, so he sent my brother, sister

and I to mascot camp. |Mv sister]
came home crying, but it worked for
m) brother and me. My brother is the
banana in the Fruit of the Loom ads.
"And now, here I am," she adds
with a smile.
She is lying. All of it.
Nobody in her family was ever a
mascot, and nobody in her family un
derstood why she wanted to become
Stanford's free. Her cousin told her
to get on ii plane back to England re
cently, because she had obviously
been in America foi ioo long.
While Newell sits outside, the I ree
costume rests against one of the
longer walls in the small, rectangular
room at the back of Stanford's Band
Shak. ()pposite the costume, another
wall is covered in an assortment of col
ors, paint impressions of the breasts of
past Stanford Dollies adorned with
their autographs. Below and to the
right of the impressions, leaning up
near the room's entrance, a green sign
from Merrill Street hides behind a
large blue street sign taken from
Newell Road.
The costume itself looks a bit Jimp
with no one inside. Its long eyelashes
droop, its luscious lips sag. The white
hat weighed down with far too many
buttons, atop its head, leans forward.
