That's exactly what the Merrill Lynch
Innovation Grants Competition is offering the
PhD candidate who best describes the commercial

by an independent panel ol distinguished scientists
and entrepreneurs. Winners will retain the

venture capitalists.

look at their ideas from a completely different
perspective —that of the marketplace.
