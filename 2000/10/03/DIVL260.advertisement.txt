The first big step in becoming an organ donor is making the decision to do so. But that decision
alone doesn't guarantee that your wishes will be followed. What many people don't know
is that the surviving family must give consent before organ and tissue recovery can
take place Without that consent, it simply won't happen Please don't let a wonderful
decision go to waste. Talk to your family about donating your organs. Talk to your family about
donating life. For more information, visit www.shareyourlife.org or call 1-800-355-SHARE.
