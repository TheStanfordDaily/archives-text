That hope died when he was killed by a drunk driver

WHEN YOU'RE WAITING FOR A TRANSPLANT,
WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT: YOUR MEDICAL
STATUS OR YOUR FINANCIAL STATUS?
Contrary to rumors you may have heard, the transplant waiting list is completely
blind to wealth or celebrity status. Once you're on the list for a donor organ,
what really counts is the severity of your illness, time spent waiting, blood
type and other important medical information. Call 1 -800-355-SHARE or visit
www.shareyourlife.org for honest information on organ donation. And remember,
if you want to be a donor, you must tell your family or it may not happen.
TALK TO YOUR FAMILY ABOUT DONATING LIFE.
