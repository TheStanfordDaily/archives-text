1966
On October 3, 1966, The Daily pub
lished an article called "Frosh Miss Goal."
The freshmen of Junipero invited the
women ol Branner and Roble 1 lalls to
party and paint the lounge.
"After 10 days of intricate planning, the
lounge in Junipero became a living reprint
of a recent Playboy spread on 'Ann-Mar
garet as Art'.... Soon a dance began in
the midst of a maze of ladders and buckets
containing every imaginable color of paint.
"The party progressed and the men of
Junipero were jubilant as the women
began to go berserk and completely ignore
the intricate patterns chalked on the wall.
Soon, the women decided that the walls
had had enough, so they began to paint
each other and everything in sight. From
here the party moved to Mem ('.law where
ihe painters calmly washed the paint off of
themselves in the fountain.
"... Now that they have a new redeco
rated lounge, they, as expressed by house
sponsor John Trimbur, 'don't quite know
what to do with it.' "
Bottom Line: The lengths freshman guys will ao
to in order to be noticed by freshman girls.
Some things never change.
