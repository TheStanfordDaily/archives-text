### 
RAM ALLAH, West Hank (AP) —
Israeli troops rolled out tanks in a show of
lorce and sent helicopter gunships aloli
yesterday lo battle Palestinians wielding
rocks and automatic rilles, as riots raged
through the West Bank and (Jaza Strip,
leaving scarceh a Palestinian town or ul
lage untouched.
I he spiraling violence, now in its fifth
day, has killed at least .">1 people and
injured more than 1,000, ncarh .til the
casualties Palestinian, and left hopes fora
Mideast peace accord in tatters. Both
sides acknowledged that talking peace
was becoming untenable with a lull-scale
war being waged in the streets.
Kven as pleas lor restraint poured in
from around the world, the climbing
casualty count fueled Palestinian fun and
spurred revenge attacks against Israeli
civilians, panic ularlv Jewish settlers.
On the road to the Jewish settlement
of Ariel in the West Bank, .i 24-year-old
Israeli was shot and killed — reportedh
when he stopped lo change a tire. A
school bus on its wa\ to the Jewish settle
ment of Sltiloh c ame under lire, but no
one was injured.
Fighting also boiled ovei into Arab

towns in Israel proper, rattling the nerves
of Israelis who have long leared an inte
ladeh. or uprising, by Arab citizens ol the
Jewish state.
Light Israeli Arabs were killed in yes
terday's c lashes alone.
Police and Arab rioters fought a three
hour battle in the allevwavs of the Israeli
town of Akko. Rioters trashed shops in
the Israeli Arab town of Nazareth, Jesus'
bovhood home.
In the coastal city of Haifa — often
cited as a model of harmonious coexis
tence ol Jews and Muslims — Israeli
Arabs staged a general strike in svmpathv
with Palestinian brethren.
Ihe Palestinian lands, though,
remained the epicenter of violence, with
a shilling battlcfront that hopscotched
from north to south and back again.
In the West Bank and (iaza, Israeli sol
diets fought dozens of running battles —
mam with live ammunition — with Pales
tinian youths wielding stones and fire
bombs.
Near the West Bank town of I ulka
rem, riotei s set ablaze eight Israeli-owned
lacloi ies last night, including two making
insect spra\. I he lire sent clouds of nox

ions fumes over t he northern Wesi Bank,
and Israeli police said Palestinian gunfire
prevented firelighters from reaching the
area.
In much of the refugee camp of Ralah
in southern Ciaza, electricity was cut when
Israelis fired an anti-tank missile at a
small power plant.
Hie detritus of conflict could he seen
everywhere. Jagged rocks, spent shells,
and broken glass littered roadways. Black
smoke Irom piles of burning tires mixed
with a white haze of acrid tear gas. The wail
of Quranic verses from mosque loudspeak
ers mingled with the- crackle of gunfire.
Israeli civilians were forbidden to navel
the main thoioughlares in the West Bank
and (iaza Strip. At the isolated Gaza settle
ment of Netzarim, the army sent a heli
copter to retrieve Israelis who had been
visiting for the Jewish New Year holiday.
Army convoys escorted others out. An
Israeli soldier who accompanied an Israeli
gasoline truck driver on a West Bank
delivery was criticalh wounded by Pales
tinian lire <in<l later died, the a rim said.

weapons by Israel contributed to the
