## Stanford volleyball drops two against hot Arizona schools 
### EZRA CALLAHAN 
On paper things look pretty grim for the
Stanford women's volleyball team (7-0, 2-4 Pa
cific 10 Conference). Following losses to No. H
Arizona (12-1, 5-0) and Arizona State (11-4, 3-
2) iliis past weekend, the C'.ardinal is faced with
some pretty ugly numbers: the first four-game
losing streak in the program's history, a drop to
No. 21 in the national rankings, and a 2-4 Pa
cific 10 record, leaving the team four games
back of conference leader I SC.
In person, however, the Cardinal squad re
fuses to let the numbers faze them. The team
remains remarkably dedicated and optimistic
in the face of such unprecedented adversity.
"We're si ill going lor it, and we aren't giving
up," said interim head coach Denise Corlelt.
"We haven't let the negative thoughts in. We're
a good team and we're going to keep working
hard to prove it."
Hard work was certainly visible on Stan
ford's side of the court this weekend, lint sever
al strong individual efforts from the Cardinal
were not enough to overcome the offensive
power displayed by the Arizona schools in Fri
day and Saturday's mate lies.
On Friday, the surging Arizona Wildcats
handed Stanford its third-straight three-game
defeat in front of over 2,000 fans at the
McHale Center in Fucson. The win was Ari

times, before Arizona c losed out the game with
four straight points to win 15-1 1.
Arizona carried momentum into the third

competive spirit Stanford battled back with the
next seven points to pull within two at 13-11,
but Arizona recovered to pull out the game and
the match, 15-1 1.
Freshman Sara McCee continued to plav
well for the Cardinal, picking up nine kills
while hitting .63(1 and tallv itig three blot ks.
Fara Conrad had eight kills off the bench,
playing ai outside hitter for the fust time
this season, awav from her usual spot at
middle blocker.
Fhe (lardinal hoped to recover on Saturdav
against Arizona State, but Stanford struggled to
up with sideouts, allowing the Sun Devils to go
on several back-breaking runs during the match.
Arizona State recovered from an embarrassing
defeat to Cal the night before, also beating the
Cardinal for the first time since 1993.

ble of," said team captain 1 .indsay kagawa. "U e

and 1 was really proud of our team for pulling
that game out."
