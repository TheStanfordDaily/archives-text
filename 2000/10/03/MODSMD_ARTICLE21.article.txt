I he N0.5 (.animal men's water polo team (">-'l,
1-2 Mountain Pacific Spoils federation) headed
into a healed match-up against lop-ranked South
ern California(B-0, 2-0 MI'SF) hoping lo find once
again whatever ii was that had propelled Stanford
to a dominating, lf>-point performance against
I JC-Santa Barbara.
Instead, the golden arms that couldn't miss 1 he
(•audio net flagged against I S( i's smothering de
fense and produced onl\ two goals l< n the (.ardinal
effort.
I o he lair, I S( ,'s offense didn't gel mm h 11101 e
action. In one of the lowest scoring games in the
sport, the undefeated I rojans lopped Si an lord,

"I (.in i remember I lie last time we scored only
two goals in ,i water polo game — and that's going
I),i< k years." said head coach Dante Dettamanti.
Alter an ollensivcb stagnant start by both teams,
I S( held a meash 1-0 halftimc lead on a goal by
Sieve O'Rourke. O'Rourke hit the mark with
minutes. 1 ( .) seconds remaining in the hall.
I he two s(|iiads practically held a clinic on team
defense. Neither allowed main shots, and both
goalkeepers. I rojan freshman Bozidar Dram
j.moyic and Stanlord sophomore Nick Kllis, per

In the second half, junior Onno Koelman
broke Stanlord's offensive silence, scoring the
first Cardinal goal. Koelman took advantage of
an extra-man situation with l:. r >l remaining in

Sophomore Peter Hudnut (3) scans the pool for an open teammate in Stanford's 9-7 win over Pacific. Hud
nut and teammate Peter Osborn both had two goals in the contest.
I'hc Trojans answered seconds
later wiili a goal of I licit own
from junior Nenad I'raporski.
(Cardinal sophomore Brian
Darrow used late-game heroic s to
tie the game again, at 2-2, with six
minutes remaining. Darrow
scrambled to inab a loose ball in

Ironi of the I rojan goal and
slammed it into the net.
Less than a minute later, it
looked as though Darrow
might spark a game-winning
c barge, stealing the ball from a
I SC player and speeding
away. However, an official
whistled Darrow fora foul on
the plav. Darrow, unable to
hear the whistle, began
stroking toward the I rojan
yoal. According to Dettamanti,

the official should have sound
ed the whistle a second time to
stop play.
Instead, the pool became a
melee of confusion, with players
on both sides uncertain as to
whether play should continue.
Darrow hesitated, and a I SC
player took advantage ol the sit
uation, picked up the ball and
proceeded under new rules,
which allow a player a tree
throw following a foul from any

where in the pool. I le passed the
ball to an open teammate, and
USC had its third goal ol the
game on what would, under the
old rules of a year ago, have
been an illegal play.
I he Trojans sealed the match
with «ui insurance goal with 1:30
remaining.
Despite his teams extraordi
narily low offensive output, Det
tamanti waspleased with their
performance. "I feel good that

our defense was able to hold I SC
to only four goals," he said.
Dettamanti speculated that
US(l's vulnerabilities will be more
evident at the end of the season.
"USC is winning a lot oi one- or
two-goal games," he said. "I have
a feeling that as the year goes on,
other teams will catch up."
On Sunday, Stanford scored
a 9-7 victory over No. I 1 Pacific.
I he Cardinal showed another
balanced scoring attack, with

seven players igniting the score
board. Pasi Dutton, Koelman,
Darrow, Peter Osborn, Nesmith
and Ainott had one goal apiece.
Peter Hudnut grabbed two
goals.
Other than missing a penalty
shot, a tare occurrence in colle
giate water polo, the Cardinal
had a strong performance, taking
advantage of the defensive press
to score four of its nine goals oil
last breaks.
