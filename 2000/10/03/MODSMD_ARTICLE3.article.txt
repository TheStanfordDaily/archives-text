Expect your dorm lounge to be
crowded tonight. Students across
campus are planning to tune in at (>
this evening to watch the first of four
presidential debates held on college
campuses.
Tonight's lace-01l between Vice Pres
ident Al Gore and Texas Governor
C leorge W. Bush is being held at the I Jni
versity of Massachusetts.
Reuters reported yesterday that the
debate will last for 90 minutes, and 80
million people are expected to watch.
With Gore ahead In only four points
in recent polls, the contest in Massachu
setts may help to steer public opinion.

All the more reason to organize a
dorm-sponsored debate party, accord
ing to resident assistants in Florence
Moore Hall.
"We re expecting a lot of people to
come and watch," said Nathan Sloll, a ju
nior and a resident assistant who helped
organize the Flo Mo event.
Other dorms, such as Kimball Hall,
have helped publicize the debates in
I heir residences and will be hosting in
formal viewing sessions.
Residences are not alone in promot
ing the debates. Student organiza
tions, such as Stanford in (Jovernment,
Stanford Democrats and Students for
Bush have all helped publicize
tonight's face-off.

The Stanford Democrats has planned
a debate-watching party for tonight at
the Schwab (Center.
" I his is an important opportunity be
cause it's the first [debate]; it's the first in
troduction to one-and-a-half hours of
unfillered Hush and Gore," said Krista
Glaser, chair of the Stanford Democrats.
"There's a lot of suspense and opportu
nity, and a lot of people will tune in."
Hut not everyone agrees. A number
of freshmen, many of whom only re
cently became eligible to vote, feel that
campus organizations have not done
enough to publicize the debates and the
election itself.
"I was surprised to see how lit
tle I've heard about the debates,"
said Jo Meyer, a freshman. "The
election has received extreme
media coverage and so the debates
may not do much to change the
opinions ol liusli and (Jore."

Paul Stratman, a sophomore, is
excited to see the first televised
contest.
"I'll definitely be watching [the
debate]," Stratman said. "I wish
they would show it in [Memorial
Auditorium]."
The second debate, between
vice-presidential candidates Dick
(llieney and Senator Joseph Lieber
man, will be held Thursday night.
