# Help for sick trees
## Australian wasps could protect infested eucalyptus trees 
### EMILY K. DUFFY 
An enemy of Stanford's fragrant eucalyp
tus trees may have finally met its match.
Parasites known as red gum lerp psyllids
first began stealing nutrients from campus
eucalyptus trees in June of 1998. A scientist
released (he parasites' natural predators,
wasps the size of a speck of black pepper, in
the area to try 10 control the problem.
Two years after the first release of wasps,
scientists and Stanford groundskeepers and
researchers found something promising.
Two weeks ago, they discovered a wasp in
Redwood (lit\ tlicit suggests that the para
sites' natural predators may indeed protect
the trees.
The problem-causing bugs seem to feed
only on t he eucalyptus camaldulensis, or red
gum eucalyptus, 700 of which are on
campus.
At the time of the infestation, UC-Bcrke

ley Prof. Don Dahlsten transported some of
the wasps from Australia, released them and
waited to see the results.
On Sept. 15, Dahlsten reported that one
of the wasps had been found in a trap in
Redwood City. Dahlsten had been study
ing these wasps to ensure that they could
safely and effectively be released into the
(lalilornia environment to combat this par
asitic infestation.
"This means that theparasitoid wasps are
spreading throughout the area, which is the
hope; th.it they will establish a population to
keep the psyllids under control," said Karen
Stidd, a University horticultural technical
specialist.
The predatory wasp was found in a trap
located about 1 1 miles from Ardenwood in
Alameda County, the site from which the
parasitoid wasps were initially released.
Therefore, officials say, it appears that the
wasps are thriving and will be able to have a
noticeable impact on the battle against the
psyllids.
Wasps were also released on campus on
Searsville Road near the Puichon Building,
Stidd said.

Groundskeepers and researchers hope tiny wasps can
help keep over 700 eucalyptus trees on campus alive.
