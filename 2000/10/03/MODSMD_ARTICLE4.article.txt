# Help for sick trees
## Australian wasps could protect infested eucalyptus trees 
### EMILY K. DUFFY 
An enemy of Stanford's fragrant eucalyp
tus trees may have finally met its match.
Parasites known as red gum lerp psyllids
first began stealing nutrients from campus
eucalyptus trees in June of 1998. A scientist
released (he parasites' natural predators,
wasps the size of a speck of black pepper, in
the area to try 10 control the problem.
Two years after the first release of wasps,
scientists and Stanford groundskeepers and
researchers found something promising.
Two weeks ago, they discovered a wasp in
Redwood (lit\ tlicit suggests that the para
sites' natural predators may indeed protect
the trees.
The problem-causing bugs seem to feed
only on t he eucalyptus camaldulensis, or red
gum eucalyptus, 700 of which are on
campus.
At the time of the infestation, UC-Bcrke

ley Prof. Don Dahlsten transported some of
the wasps from Australia, released them and
waited to see the results.
On Sept. 15, Dahlsten reported that one
of the wasps had been found in a trap in
Redwood City. Dahlsten had been study
ing these wasps to ensure that they could
safely and effectively be released into the
(lalilornia environment to combat this par
asitic infestation.
"This means that theparasitoid wasps are
spreading throughout the area, which is the
hope; th.it they will establish a population to
keep the psyllids under control," said Karen
Stidd, a University horticultural technical
specialist.
The predatory wasp was found in a trap
located about 1 1 miles from Ardenwood in
Alameda County, the site from which the
parasitoid wasps were initially released.
Therefore, officials say, it appears that the
wasps are thriving and will be able to have a
noticeable impact on the battle against the
psyllids.
Wasps were also released on campus on
Searsville Road near the Puichon Building,
Stidd said.

Groundskeepers and researchers hope tiny wasps can
help keep over 700 eucalyptus trees on campus alive.
C)nly two trees, both in the park
ing lot of Maples Pavilion, have
been cut down this year after hav
ing succumbed to these insects, sug
gesting that the wasps have been
doing their jobs well.
Meanwhile, the ellects ol the
bugs are still apparent on campus
grounds.
These parasites feed on the trees
by attaching to leaves and sucking
out nutrients. T he trees begin to
defoliate rapidh and lose necessary
strength from their leaves.
Not onlv do leaves lall off, but
the insects also release a white sug

ary substance that piles into sticky
mounds on cars and paved areas.
In areas such as the entire ex
panse between Maples Pavilion,
Sena Street and El ('.amino Real
and the area around Governor's
('.orner, eucalyptus trees are show
ing the detrimental weakening ef
fects of the scrounging pests.
While groundskeepers wait for
the wasps to begin making their
mark, the most that they can do is
provide extra water and (are to
pi < >m< >te m<>re strengt hin I lie trees.
Groundskeepers are hoping
that these human ellbrts will be
enough to preserve the trees until
a much smaller creature, the para
sitoid wasp, arrives to perform its
essential task.
