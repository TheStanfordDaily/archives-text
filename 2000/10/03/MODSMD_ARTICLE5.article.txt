## Program kicks off year with new leader, classes 
### NICHOLAS CHAN 
Although the new year is barely
a week old, the Introduction to tlit*
Humanities Program is already
seeing some changes.
For starters, Orrin Robinson,
former head of the German De
partment, recently succeeded
Harry Elam as the program's
director.
According to Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education John
Bravman, Robinson was chosen
lor his "broad interest in the hu
manities, his excellent track record
in working with and on behalf ol
undergraduates and his commit
ment to ... a liberal education."
Bravman announced Robin
son's appointment in early June.
Robinson takes over for Drama
Prof. Harry Elam, who served a
three-year term. Robinson's will
also serve in the program for three
years.
Robinson already has big plans
for the 1-1111111 program.

"I am in the somewhat unenvi
able position of trying to improve
an already good program," said
Robinson. 1 le added that he plans
to pursue at least two separate,
jects during his time as director: '
His first goal is to encourage
faculty to leach sections in addition
to the lectures they already deliver.
Because he taught a secticfti in
1998-1999, Robinson has had ex
perience in (his field.
1 le said he knows firsthand the
eflects of this dose faculty and stti
dent interaction.
Robinson also wants to revamp
the fall quarter curriculum by cre
ating "bridge" classes.
These classes will focus on more
subtle topics such as the relation
ship between humanities, social
sciences and the hard sciences.
It would involve professors
from both the "fuzzy" and "techie"
sides of Stanford, allowing stu
dents to discover new perspectives
on the humanities, he said.
Even before Robinson took
over, the I-Hum program has al
ready underwent several changes
this year.
Seven classes, including Great
Works I and Freedom and Eros in
Philosophy and Art were removed
112 rom last year's curriculum.
1-Hum staff introduced 11 new
courses this year, including The
History of Nature and the Nature
of History and Origins: Contested
Identities.
This turnover is consistent with
the goals of I-Hum.
"The professors seem to be
very interested in teaching the
course and in interacting with the
students," said freshman Erin
Archerd, a current I-Hum
student.
Although Robinson has never
served as the director of I-Hum,
he has had several years of experi
ence with I-Hum both as a lectur

er and a section leader.
He lias previously worked with
undergraduates as a i w< >-\ ear mem
ber of the Committee on I ncler
graduate Studies, and then as the
head of the committee lor one year.
As a member ol the commit lee,
Robinson approved undergradu
ate curricula i<>r two anil tropology
majors and the renewal <>l interde
partmental programs.
Alter growing up in both the
Philippines and Hawaii, Robinson
attended Stanford, where he grad
uated with .i bachelor's degree in
Psychology in 1 DOS.
Following Ins graduation, he
received a Ph.D. in linguistic s from
Cornell I niversity. He taught at
IJC-Berkeley lor a year, but re
turned to Stanford where he
taught in the German Depart
ment. I le also spent time as a resi
dent lellow in Roblc Hall and La
gunita (lourt.
