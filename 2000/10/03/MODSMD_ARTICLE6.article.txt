# Summer fun around the globe
## 
### CORINNE YATES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For sonic Stanford students, summer was anything
but lazy. Whether volunteering at a hospital in Nepal,
doing contract work in London, teaching elementary
school in India, designing puzzle games or researching
classical music , students left behind their usual routine
to pursue their passions.
Nursing in Nepal
Sophomore Liz Kwo spent her summer in Nepal
working in Kanti Children's Hospital with patients
under the ageof 14. The idea came from a medical stu
dent, and she called the hospital to ask about
opportunities.
'They told me that ill showed up they'd try to work
something out, so I just bought my ticket and went,"
Kwo said. "I fell into a slump alter freshman year, and I
wanted to discover myself. Traveling c hanges your per
spective no matter where you go."
Kwo worked with children in the physical therapy

department, playing with the kids and moving their
arms and hands around.
"They were screaming in pain, "she said. "Because of
their diseases, it was very painful for them to move."
Kwo described cases in which children came into
the hospital with burned faces and bodies, parents
who left their children and never returned. She was
especially upset at the hospital's limitation due lo its
extreme poverty.
"1 realized that I took my whole life for granted,"
Kwo explained.
During a part of her stay, Kwo hiked into the villages.
She was taken aback by their extreme hospitality and re
ligions fait h.
"They would offer for me to stay in their home when
they could hardly feed themselves," she said. "They
gave me a lot of respect."
Kwo's experience had such a profound effect on her
that she plans to start a program called the Nepal IVe
med Pediatric Clinical Internship.
"I would totally recommend doing this, no matter

what your major or career goals,"
she said. "I iliink it's something that
every college student should experi
ence at some point in their careers."
Interning overseas
Senior Armen Berjikly, along
with three of his draw mates, fi
nanced a three-month stay in Eu
rope by doing independent com
puter contract work.
"We didn't have time in our
schedules to do an overseas pro
gram, Â«md we all really wanted to
visit Kurope, so this was the perfect
opportunity," Berjikly said.
Berjikly and his friends worked
under ShareYourWorld.com, a
digital talent agency that acts as a
brokerage house between individu
als who upload original multimedia
files and the large media corpora
tions that use them.
11 ley w< >i kec 11< > create a c< >mput
er program that could convert be
tween different types of online video
formats such as MPEG and avi.
Because the job did not require
the group to work in a specific lo
cation, they decided to take their
laptops to a rented apartment in
London.
"We were the ultimate telecom
muters," Berjikly laughed. "For
me, it was the ideal internship ex
perience." Berjikly said they didn't
want to work the usual Silicon
Valley internship.
"We worked just as hard for just
as many hours, but we were fortu
nate enough to have the opportuni

ty to do that in Europe with friends,"
he said.
The group researched online
and in books to learn the skills nec
essary to complete their task. They
checked in with their California
based employer every few weeks
through e-mail and by telephone.
Berjikly and his friends complet
ed their project in London and took
a month-long trip through all of Eu
rope, from Scandinavia to Spain.
"It was an incredible way to
spend the summer," Berjikly said.
"But, in the end, 1 was glad to get
home alter so much time away."
A rural learning experience
Senior Takako Mukai joined
three other students teaching ele
mentary-age children in India
under Project DOSTI (which
means "friendship" in 1 lindi).
She had been interested in visit
ing India since her freshman year
and saw the six-week project as a
good opportunity.
"W'e lived without running water
and electricity," Mi ikai said." 11's un
comfortable, but you get used to not
having all of the extra stuff."
Mukai taught the children bead
ing and worked with them on cut
and-paste projects.
"In the mornings, a herd of kids
would run across the field, dodging
cows, and grab onto our legs be
cause they were so happy to see us,"
she said.
Near the end of her trip, Mukai
look a vacation to visit different c ities
including Varinasi, the holy c ity of
I linduism. She had the opportunity
to sit under the tree where Buddha
reached enlightenment.

"I feel like I'm a more accepting
person because I've seen and par
tially experienced all of this," Mukai
said of her time in India. "It helped
me mature a lot."
Playing games
Sophomore Caroline Clabaugh
spent her summer working for For
rest-Pru/an Creative, a two-person
team hired by Cranium, Inc., to de
sign a new puzzle product.
"Since it was pretty much just my
two bosses and me, I got to do a little
of everything," she said.
Clabaugh contributed to brain
storming meetings, wrote puzzles,
did page layout and helped design
and implement the test plan.
Originally from Washington,
Clabaugh said she used to go with
her high school friends to Entros, a
restaurant where people can play
group games.
She loved the games and hoped
t hat she would get an opportunity to
work on them. When Entros said
that they did not have internship
p< )sitions, they referred Clabaugh to
former employees that had started
their own company.
"The best part of the job was
feeling that 1 was an integral part
of this brand-new, small compa
ny," she said. "I knew everything
that was going on . . . and I can't
wait to see the final product in a
few months."
The new product should be
available in Starbucks stores in
about six months, she said.
Musical tour
Classical pianist Phiroz Tara

pore, a junior, attended classical
music festivals throughout Europe
with the help of a grant from
Undergraduate Research
Opportunities.
He searched for common
themes in the different concerts he
attended throughout England,
Scotland, Belgium, Germany, Aus
tria and France.
In addition to attending the con
certs, Tarapore also had the oppor
tunity to interview with some of the
performers.
"It was the first time 112 really
bridged the gap between performer
and audience member," he said. "So
often we define a performer's exis
tence by what we see of him onstage,
and we forget entirely that they're a
human being with all the hopes and
dreams that we have."
Tarapore especially enjoyed
chatting over coffee with two Ro
manian women who played in a
concert by the Academy of St. Mar
tin-in-the-Fields, a London sym
phony orchestra.
"I heard all about their life in Ro
mania, the way they studied and
practiced, and their fears and aspi
rations for their careers in music,"
he said.
Tarapore said he was amazed by
a concert in Vienna where about
2,000 people sat in the rain before a
three-story projection screen.
"This kind of integration of clas
sical music into everyday existence
was very exciting to me," he said. "[lt
was] something completely alien to
me, [being] a product of American
culture."
Tarapore will conclude his re
search with a report to be read by his
adviser. Assoc. Prof. Thomas Grey.
