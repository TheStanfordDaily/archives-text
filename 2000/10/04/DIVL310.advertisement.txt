Mary
Karr
presents
her new book,
Cherry:
A Memoir
wmmmm
In The Liar's Club, Mary Karr told the
prizewinning tale of her hardscrabble Texas
childhood with enough literary verve to spark
a renaissance in memoir. The Liars' Club rode
the top of The New York Times bestseller list
for more than a year, and publications ranging
from The New Yorker to People magazine picked
it as one of the best books of the year. But it
left people wondering: How'd that scrappy kid
make it outa there? Cherry dares to tell that
story. Karr picks up the trail and dashes off
into her teen years with customary sass, only
to run up against the paralyzing self-doubt of
a girl in bloom. Mary Karr's memoir, The Liars'
Club, won the PEN/Martha Albrand Award.
A poet and essayist, she has won Pushcart
prizes in both genres. Her other grants and
awards include the prestigious Whiting Award
and the Bunting Fellowship from Radcliffe
College. Her previous poetry collections are
Abacus, The Devil's Tour, and Viper Rum. She
is a full professor at Syracuse University.
