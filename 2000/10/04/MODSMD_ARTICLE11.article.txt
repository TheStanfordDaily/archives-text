1979
()n ()ctober 1, 1979, 1 lie Daily took
note of a stinging problem at Stanford.
"II it's not the morning alter and the
buzzing in vour ears seems louder than
normal, be sure and keep your eyes open;
it may be one <>l the thousands of bees,
hornets and yellow jackets that have invad
ed the Stanford campus.
"Bees Â«ind yellow jackets are especially
attracted to lood odors .ind are often
found when the weather is warm and dry.
"... Many students are so frightened of
the bees and yellow ja< kcts that they opt to
eat indoors even on nice days.
"Freshman Mike Cluilevich suggested,
as he < hased a bee out of his butterscotch
pudding, that the bees were trying to make
a statement.
" 'I was reading a 1 )aily article on the
mascot issue the other day when a bee
wandered over and stung me on the
elbow. I think he was trying to say that we
should be called the'Stanford Yellow-Jack
ets',' he said."
Bottom Line: Just when you think that your din
ing situation can't get any worse, remember
that it can.
