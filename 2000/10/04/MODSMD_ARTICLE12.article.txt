A visionary meeting room created
two years ago at Stanf ord University
is so elose to practicality that some
contractors and engineers are ready
to build their own.
. . . An array of 4-ft touch-pad
wall panels and an under-table pro
jector are key display devices, but the
system allows almost anything, from
job cams to hand-helds, to be linked.
. . . One panel can show a con
struction schedule chart; another
displays 2D plans of an area being
discussed; and yet another, a 3D or
even 4D display of a project going
through the process of assembly. Ac
tions on one display . . . can auto
matically bring up relevant displays
on other screens. It can be seen at
