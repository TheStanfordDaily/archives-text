### 
BOS TON (AP) — Vice President A1
(•ore and 1 exas Cov. Ceorge W. Bush
clashed over tax cuts, prescription
drug assistance under Medicare and
abortion List night in their first cam
paign debate of the fall, a pivot point
in the clc»sest White I louse c ontest in a
generation.
Combative from the outset, (lore
charged dial Ins rival's lax plan would
"spend more money on lax cuts for the
wealthiest one percent than all of the
new spending lie proposes for educa
tion, health care, prescription drugs
and national defense all combined."
But Bush, standing a few feet awa\
on a debate stage at the University of
M assachusctts, said (lore's economic
plan would offer relief only to the mid
dle (lass. "Everybody who pays taxes
ought to get relief ," he said. At the same
time, lie said, it would produce "dra
maticallv" bigger government with 200
"new or expanded programs" and
20,000 new bureaucrats.
"It empowers Washington," added
the governor, who hastened to tell a
national viewing audience he was from
West Texas — not the nation's capital.
Over and over, he accused (lore of
"fuz/.v math."
Core and Bush met for the first of
three presidential debates over the next
two weeks, each man seeking advantage
in a rate so dose that poll after poll
shows them within a point or two of one
.mother. Their vice presidential candi
dates, Democ rat Joseph Lieberman and
Republican Dick Cheney, debate
tomorrow in Kentucky,
Jim Telner of PBS was moderator,
operating under strict rules negotiated
in advance bv the Core and Bush
camps. It was, he said at the outset, the
first of three 00-minnte debates
between the two major partv rivals — a
format that excluded Ralph Nader and
I'at Buchanan, running as minor party
< anclidattttk>
In a reprise of his acceptance speech
at this summer's Democratic National
Convention, Core said it was important
to stand up to the special interests,
pharmaceutical companies among
them. "Big drug companies support

Covernor Bush's prescription drug
proposal, he said. "They oppose
mine."
Bush made a sour face when he
heard tli.it, and in his next breath
offered a swift rebuttal.
"I've been standing up to Big Holly
wood and Big Trial Lawyers," he shot
back, mentioning two groups that have
lavished campaign donations on Core
and Democrats.
The two men argued at length over
prescription drugs for Medicare recipi
ents, a kc\ issue, panic ularh in the kev
battleground slates of the Midwest.
Bush blamed Washington for failing to
pass legislation, and touted his own
plan to have states offer benefits.
"You've had your chance, Mr. Vice
President," the governor said.
But Core, who favors a prescription
drug benefit available to .ill Medicare
recipients, said thai under Bush's plan
onl\ low-income seniors would receive
immediate help. Everyone else would
have to wait up to loin veai s, he s.iid. In
addition, lie- added, seniors could be
fenced into HMOs to get a prescription
drug benefit.
"I cannot let this go bv, the old-stvle
Washington politic s. Irving to scare \ou
with phon\ numbers," Bush swifth
replied. He accused Core of "Medi
sc are."
" I his is a man who has great num
bers." he said of the vice president.
"I'm beginning to think not onh did lie
invent the Internet, he invented the
calculator."
Asked about a recent FDA decision
approving the use of the abortion pill
Rl -ISf). bush said, "I don't think a
president can" overturn such a deci
sion. He then restated his willingness to
sign legislation banning so-called "par
tial birth abortions," and said Core
wouldn't.
Core said he would ban such late
term procedures, but onh il it included
exemptions to protect the life or health
ot the woman, the position Clinton lias
taken in vetoing two bills on the subjee t
from the Republican-controlled
(ongrcss.
Eager to regain the offensive on a

volatile issue, Core s.iid Bush would
appoint jnsii<cs to the Supreme Court
who would overturn a Io7!'> ruling that
legalized a right to abortion. "I support
,i woman's right to choose. \lv oppo
nent does not."
Bush said he was "pro-life, but dis
puted ,ui\ suggestion that he would use
the issue .is .i litmus lest for appoint
ments to the high court.
Core sighed audibh when Bush said
that, as il to register disbelief.
On the first foreign policy issue to
come up, Core and Bush agreed thc\

would not use force to tr\ and remove
Slobodan Milosevic from power in
Yugoslavia, even though thc\ agreed
he had been defeated in recent elec
tions and should give up power.
Asked about energy policy, Core
attacked Bush for proposing oil drilling
in the Arctic National Wildlife Area
Bush said such domestic oil explo
ration was preferable to continuing to
import a million barrels ol oil a day
from Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
To keep the candidates cool, univer
sity officials turned the thermostat

inside the ('.lark Athletic Center gym
well below (>."> degrees. That's the show
time temperature, once the lights were
Hipped on and seats filled, that was
required under contract by the Com
mission on Presidential Debates.
The bipartisan group is sponsoring
all tout debates with the idea that thev
will be shown on as many TV networks
as possible. Most were carrying the first
one, but \ B(! gave its affiliates ;i choice
between the baseball playoffs and the
debate, while FOX went with its series
premiere of "l);n k Angel."
