### 
WASH INC. lON (AP) — A
major vaccine manufacturer
agreed vesterday to pay .1 mil
lion fine for repcatedh violating
federal drug-quality rules at two
of its nianufac tilling plants,
including a llu-shot facton whose
tcmporarv closure contributed to
this year's delay in flu vaccine.
Wvct h-Avcrst Laboratories
signed the consent decree with
the Food and Drug Administra
tion. which also requires the
IVnnsvlvania-basccl company to
take specific steps to improve
qualit\ at the plants on a preset
s< hedule or face up to S3 million
more in fines.
I lie FDA said n never found
contaminated VVveth products
and is aware of no illnesses. It
nevertheless called the manufac
turing problems serious violations
of rules meant to ensure that
drugs and vaccines are sterile and
of high qualitv.
The consent decree was
prompted because Wvctli did not
correct violations despite repeal
ed FDA inspections, warnings and
even the seizure last |une of hun
dreds of closes of prescription
drugs and vaccines made .it one
of the- substandard plants, FDA
said.
I lie factories are in Marietta,
Pa., and Peat I River, N.Y. Hie
violations dated back to 1995.
I hirt\ million dollars is sub
st.mti.il nioncx to us. no doubt
about that. It is dear that FDA did
regard these problems ,is prob
lems that needed more attention
and .1 f'astei pace than we

achieved," s;i i< 1 Dr. Bruce
Burlington, Wveth's senior vice
president, who formerly worked
at the FDA.
"We've been working hard on
those problems," Burlington said.
Among other steps, Wyeth hired
outside (|ii.ilit\ consultants to tell
FDA how the violations were
being collected; the federal
agency also must reinspect the
factories.
Among products made at the
problem plants is flu vaccine.
Shipments of flu shots to doc -
tors' offices are being delaved this
fall, which li.is prompted federal
offic i.ils to urge that the first avail
able vaccine be given to elderly
and chronically ill. I lie reason:
All vaccine makers had trouble
producing the right influcn/.a
strain, plus FDA-discovered man
ufacturing problems caused some
companies temporarily to stop
pi oc I net ion.
All Wveth's fin vaccine-related
problems have been fixed and
production restarted, Burlington
said. Wyeth should begin ship
ping fin shots In midmonth and
expects to have produced 21 mil
lion closes by the middle of
I )cccinbci.

or other vaccines to be sold until
