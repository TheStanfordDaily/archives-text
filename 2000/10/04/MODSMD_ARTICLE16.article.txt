Student input should be
considered in Dish regulations
I used to find solace at tlit* Dish.
Now all 1 find is another constructed
reality.
Where die earth is scarred by pavement,
bv fluorescent signs,
bv individuals instructed to keep guard.
But you cannot control nature.
It you do it is no longer something free
and wild,
but just another park, not much different
than
our own neatly mowed and trimmed
backyards.
Yes, 1 understand the Foothills are not
healthy.
I hey need to be rehabilitated, saved for
future generations,
lint no one asked the students.
No one asked us what compromises
might be possible:
Narrowing the main trail and keeping it
a dirt path ...
(Hosing off some, but not all of the small
er trails....
Keeping the hours more flexible ....
"You're l.'p and We're Open" does not
apply at the Dish.
So to the powers that be,
Next time remember that nature does
not just include
.i piece of land, but includes people too.

Suggestion for the Dish
Perhaps Stanford should follow Palo
Alto's lead in restricting access to parks.
|list .is the Clity of Palo Alto limits entry
to Foothills Park to Palo Alto residents,
the Iniversity could allow only Stanford
affiliates around the Dish area.
Fnvironnu ntal problem solved!
