### ALEX BENJAMIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Starting out with an impressive 8-0-1
record this season, the Stanford men's
soccer team has managed to give up only
one goal so tar this season. In NCAA soc
cer, that's what you call an amazing run.
1 he reason?
Look no lurther than the rough grass
in front of the goal mouth.
Coming from in nearby Cupertino,
goalie Adam Zapala arrived to Stanford
in 1996 onl) to sit out for his first year. A
year later as a redshirt freshman, he start
ed to make his mark on Cardinal soccer
In plav ing every minute of the season.
Zapala made his mark that year by
putingt up some very impressive num
bers. Facing T>f> shots that season, he al
lowed only 14 goals while earning a
school-record-tying 12 shutouts, giving
him a goals-against-average of 0.66, the
second lowest in Stanford history. Also
within that first season, Zapala managed
to break another school record with seven
consecutive shutouts, blanking the (lardi
nal's opponents tor 76'} minutes in a row
at one point.
"Apart from being a great goal keeper
<md being able to stop shots, Adam has a
great feeling tin the game," says head
coat h Hobby ('lark. "I le acts as a leader at
not only the back of the defense, but the
entire team."
At the end of the season Zapala re
ceived a slew of honors tor his efforts,

being named t Soccer America's All-
Freshman tear and National Soccer
Coaches Associ.ion of America Far West
Region All-Amdca. I le finished the year
ranked sixth inie nation (second among
fresh men).
The followig year would be no differ
ent. In 1998, Zpala surpassed the record
that he had tie a only the year before by
accumulatings shutouts in one season.
Zapala's juior year in 1999 was just as
impressive « his first two seasons.
Recording me shutouts with a 0.88
(lAA, Zapala as one of only six players to
start every g;ne, playing all but five min
utes of the eiire season.
He was uned both a NCSCAA Far
West RegioiMl-American and Academic
All-America in addition to second team
Mountain kcific Sports Federation All-
Federation
I bis yeaZapala comes into the season
again as anJl-American candidate and as
one ofStaiord's tri-captains.
Despiteus records and amazing num
bers, the fill-year senior is much more to
the team tan a stone wall in the goal.
"It's ne to have someone who has
been aroad and knows the team," says
Clark. "H knows everything that 1 have
to say anrhe understands what the team
should bdoing, so he really becomes an
extra co;ii [on the field].
"If ya just listen to him, he's talking
the who game. I le knows all of the posi
tions ail knows where they should be.
He real does a tremendous job."

So far this season "Coach" Zapala has
stepped right back in where he leit offthe
last three seasons. Considering he has al
ready accumulated an impressive eight
shutouts, (surrendering his one and onlv
goal in last week's 1-1 tie against No. 9 San
Jose State), hisCAAisat an impressive 0.12
with 21 saves recorded so far this season.
Even after two impressive shutouts
this weekend versus Seton Hall and

(.iiu innati to add to the Cardinal's unde
feated record, Zapala understands ili.it
there is alwavs room lor improvement,
not only within the team but also on a per
sonal level.
"For me, I felt as though the week
end went well," he said. "Anvtitnc von
put up two zero's in ,i weekend voii
should be pleased, but there are .ilw,t\s
little tilings to work on. lilnnkth.it I am

m\ toughest critic:.
"1 think tlit* real positive thing about
ihis side is that we all realize we have not
U't l eat'lied our potential. I here is a huge
n >oni tor improvement in a lot of different
areas, |l>ut| considering that we are not
pla\ ing our best soccer, there is room for
excitement. Ihe most important thing
lor us is tt> keep improving throughout
the vear — we can't level oil."
