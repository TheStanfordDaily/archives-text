### GREG BRAZEAL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
(lowell Student Health Sen ices is
weighing whether to oiler on site the re
cently approved abortion pill known as
mifepristone, according to (iowell 1 )irec
tor Ira Friedman.
"Students will have access to [mifepris
tone] among all othei options, as it is rec
ognized as a s.ile <md effective method of
pregnancv termination, - ' Friedman said.
"We are looking into whether ii would be
wise medicalK to prescribe it at C.owell,
and we have not come to a conclusion
on that."
Mifepristone, which will be marketed
iu the I nited Slates under the brand

name "Mifeprex," has been available in
Kurope for over a decade under the name
Rl -48(i. President Bill (llinton lifted a ban
in 1993 that prevented women from im
poi ting the di ug lor personal use, but ap
proval tin marketing mifepristone iu the
United States did not arrive until last
I hursday.
(Lowell's Women's ('.are (llinic already
provides referrals for obstetric care and
terminations of pregnancy.
"We have alwavs oflered access to the
lull range of pregnancy options," fried
man said. "That is modern reproductive
health care."
"We c are lor our pregnant patients by
referring them to Stanford Medical Cen
ter or to specialists in the neighboring
c (immunity," he added.
Whether or not the pill is ever pre
scribed through ( owcll, Friedman savs he
expects mifepristone will be presented to
patients during consultation .is an option.
Students had mixed reactions to the
possibilitv of'abort ions becoming available

through ('owell.
"1 think that's fine-," senior Neville San
jana said. "Ii gives St an lore I students mc ire
of a right tochclose. ... I think thai the pill
is jusi part of a whole scl ol sen it es that fall
under the current title of (lowell, which is
student health services."'
|unior Kanganaih Sudarshan dis
agreed, citing Cowell's mission state
ment, "to enhance vour efforts to im
prove all aspec.ls ofVenn health care, sup
port and education."
"Ii is difficult toe laim thai abortion 'im
proves' one's health, or that pregnancy
harms' one's health," Sudarshan said. "In
fact, ii is almost sick to think of the begin
ning ofa human life as some kind of s\ mp
lom that needs to be alleviated or, dare I
say, cured."

Stanford Students for (choice, agreed yvith

can prescribe it, while surgei) is

the number 01 general nature of
abortions performed in the I nitcd
States. Since the pill debuted in
Fiance in H)SS, researchers have
found that abortion rates there did

not increase and surgery remained
the most common form of abortion.

In addition, five to eight percent
of women who use mifepristone re
quire additional surgery, and the
physician prescribing the drug
must be prepared to perform that
surgery or refer the patient to
someone who can. Roughly one in
100 patients require surgery to
stop bleeding caused bv the drug.
Despite the difficulties of using
.ind administering mifepristone,
senior and Students for (ihoice
member Ellen Matsuniuta drew
attention to the drug's meaning in

the- abortion debate.
"Making the procedure avail
able in mainstream medical centers
and t In lit s not only protects doc
tors and patients from the violent e
directed at abortion clinics," she
s.iid, "but also s\ mholically brings ii
back under the rubric in which ii
belongs: women's health and
women's bodies.''
Other students downplay the
significance of mifepristone's ap
proval to the abortion debate. Se
nior Anne Berry, president of Stan
ford Students tor Life, maintains
tli;ii whether an abortion is per
formed through a pill or surgery
