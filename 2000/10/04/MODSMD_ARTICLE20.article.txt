Lt't's set aside the rules ot good sports
manship for just a moment here and
admit the following: If Pacific 10 Confer
ence Commissioner Thomas (I lanscn
saunters into his next NCAA meeting smoking a
Cuban cigar the size of his forearm and wearing a
T-shirt that reads "I Am The Finest In All The
Land," we will not hold it against him. ()ur sym
pathies are in his corner.
year, poor Tom and his Merry Band of
Foot-ballin' Fools staggered to a 20-18 record
against nonconlerence opponents, and the
phrase' West (-oast fcxitball'got treated with about
the same respect as, we 11... Calfciotball. 1999 was
a down year for Pac-10 football in the same wav
that 1066 wasn't the choicest time to he vacation
ing in Hastings.
Understand, the Pac-10 is not the Big Skv
Conference. Most of those nonconference
games are against teams like Texas-Fl Paso and
Middle Tennessee State. Going 20-18 against
schools of that caliber is like the Giants playing
.500 ball against the Softball team from St. Mary's
Sisters of the Incontinent.
That was then.
This is now.
This year, to date, the Pac-10 is 21-0 against
nonconference opponents, with four upsets of
top-five teams in as many weeks. Don't look now,
but fully half the league — ()regon, Washington,
UCII A, USC ] and, saints preserve us, ()regon State
— is in the top 25 this week. Would you believe no
conference in the country has more?
So we'll forgive Tom fora little bit of brag
gadoccio when he heads over to see the boys
out in the middle of the country. After endur
ing a year of taunts, he's entitled to hock a
metaphorical Loogie of Righteous Satisfaction
into the figurative Punch Bowl of Chastened

Texas Pride.

What can we ac tuall\ learn
from the sudden and startling
turnaround of the Pac-10?

I wo things: home field matters in college foot
ball. And (surprise, surprise) it helps t< > have .i de
cent quarterback.
Lesson ()ne: ()f the IS non-conference losses
last vear, including bowl games. 1 <>l them hap
pened when the- Pac-10 team was on the road. No
big insight there; vou lose on the road more than
at home. The big deal is .i simple st.it ist i< al anom
aly: even big national game — '/ona-Penn State.
Stanford-1 exas, I S( . \( >tre I )atne - - took place
on the road.
II lis vear, it's the flip side. Lvei \ single big Pac -
10 win this yeai — Washington-Miami, I ( LA-
Michigan, Stanford-Texas — has come on the
West Coast (we'll ignore I SC-Penn State, since
beating Joe Pa's squad this veai turns out not to Ix
all th.it big a deal).
Lesson one, then, is when vou're looking to
turn your sorry conference's reputation around,
make sure vou bring the big boys to voui house.
So before Big loin starts commissioning thai
marble bust of himself, he'd best thank the statis
tical fluke of scheduling that brought us the sik -
cess of this vear.
I x'sson two is a little subtler, but niavbe more
important: quarterback controversies don't help
anyone out.
Six of the league's teams last vear used a two

pronged QB svstem It>r .it least part ot the sea
son — Oregon, Arizona, Washington State,
Stanford, I C I.A and I SC.. Some of these svs
tems were inspired in part by injury, but all be
came ,ii some point .1 division of leadership be
tween two men.
Maybe the biggest change in the intangibles of
the conference this vear has been the emergence
of a core group of studs under center. |oe\ I lar
rington .11 Oregon, |ason (lesser at Washington
State and (.arson Palmer at I S( have all taken
control of then programs.
Where I'ac-10 teams have used more than tine
QB this veai. it's alwa\ s been 011 account ofinjun
(as in here 1111'iilt»Alto)01 suspension (Rvan Keah
at Arizona State). I heoiil\ plate they're facing po
tential ct uitroversv is at I ( lA, but phenom ('.t >r\
Pans threw st > well in his return Saturda\ that he's
probabh lt»t ketl up the job.
So what?
Simple lesson. When a team's offense can at 1-
jusi to one guv — just one —it runs a lot
'smoother. It's awlulh tempting to demand the
option tjiiarterbat k 101 thisantl the ptx'kct passei
lot that, but, to be honest, mixing <111 option in
here and there won't fool main Big XII teams.
Big 1 it)iictinference wins call for efticiencv,
comfort and mistake-free Itnitball. Those things
stem from being at home and knowing who's run
ning the show li ain't unit hof a lesson, but hope
liilh it'll silence a tew calls for Rvan McCann in
1 A. or A. j. I felt \ up in Kugene il either of these
teams fiiltci this veai.
I ntil then, let's lift a glass to Big I tun I lansen
and wish 11 in 1 the best. When vou got it, flaunt it.
