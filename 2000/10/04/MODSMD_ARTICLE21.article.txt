The men's team, including former

in Atlanta.

the games that the Americans would win ;i

Yet there they were, in the semifinals
against Russia, pushing a better team to its

the team benefited from a favorable draw

I hat still leaves a core of'talented voung

Logan loin, the 19-year-old from Stati

Irom two games down to defeat

Regla lories, who was 17 when
Cinba won its first gold medal in
1992. has to retire sometime.
At one end ol the spectrum in
the men's tournament was Yu
goslavia — focused, unified, even
player doing his little part on even
point. I lie team learned more
ill.in anyone else in the field, and
improved each time out. It lost to
Russia and ItaK to start the games,
and bv the time the Hi-da} tourna
ment was oyer, it bad beaten ItaK
.ind irouiiced the Russians Ibi the
gold medal.
At the opposite end of dial great
moment was the United States,

which got creamed by the Yu
goslavs and everyone else it
played. 1 lie Americans bit their
low moment in the final game of
group plav, when, alrcach out of
the tournament, they lost to a
backnp-lillecl Italian team in a
match that wasn't worth the face
value ola seat in the- rafters.
"I don't think we could've really
put our linger on it," Krik Sullivan
said of the team's myriad prob
lems. "II it was just one or two
things, we probably could have
(orrected it. It was kind of a culmi
nation of everything."
I lie men's team is set fora seri

ous house cleaning, and Beal
sounded like a man who didn't
want to take four more years of the
punishment.
I lie scjuacl lias promise, howev
er. Six-fbot-7, 255-pound hitter
Cieorge Roumain is only 24 and
could be a one-man demolition new
in Athens if someone can be found
to get him the ball where be likes it.
And Ryan Millar, 22, can provide
instant offense at the other side.
What's needed are blockers.
And some heart. And the sacrifice
to give up two or three years of
youth to move to (Colorado Springs
and rebuild the* program.
