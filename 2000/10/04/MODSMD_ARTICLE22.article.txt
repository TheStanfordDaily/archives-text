## Cutler breathes life into toys at Pixar 
### ALICIA McCANN 
Pixar Ever since it created the lovable Woody
& Co. in the 1995 classic " lov Story," the name
has conjured up images of a fantastic world where
toys come to life when we aren't looking. For
Larry Cutler, a Stanford alumnus, Pixar's projects
are more than just Friday night entertainment —
they are his career.
\\ hen Larry ('.utler graduated from Stanford in
1996, he held both abac helor's and a master's de
gree in computer science. ( aider's interests, howev
er, reached beyond the world of computers. While
at Stanford, Cutler was a member of the Fvcrydav
People a cappella group and Ram's I lead Theatri
cal Society, taking part in multiple Big Came Cai
eties productions and staying true to his love of the
ater and music.
Motivated by the desire to keep the arts as a
major part of his life, he decided to combine his love
of computers with art. I he result: the novel world of
computer animation.
(aider began working for Pixar, the cc >mpany re
sponsible for the highest grossing animated films of
1998 ("A Bug's 1 afe") and 1999 ("Toy Story 2"), after
earning his master's degree — and he was immedi
ately hooked. Simultaneously intense and highly re
warding, Pixar allowed him to use his computer sci
ence skills creatively, as part of the entertainment in
dustry. It offered "the perfect mesh of art and sci
ence," according to (aider.
When Cutler arrived at Pixar, his first assign
ment was asa technical director for the feature film
" Foy Story 2." (aider and his team were responsi
ble for stages such as modeling and programming
development.
According to (lutler, his work is akin to sculpting
on a computer. "A lot of work at Pixar goes into
making sure the characters are correct. We put both
technical and animation time into each and even
character," (aider said.
"With every movie there are a couple of ke\ tech
nical challenges." One such challenge was how to
convey realistic human characteristics through the
medium of computer animation. Because of our fa
miliarity with human features and gestures, we arc
able to detect even minor aberrations in .miniated
human c haracters.

As part of a team designed to tackle flie*
issue, duller worked to perfect details such as
blemishes and facial hair, using a technique
called "shading."
In shading, computer programs that describe
surface characteristics, including textures, finishes
.Hid colors, are added to every object in the scene.
These programs, called "shaclers," can simulate a
wide variety of textures and appearances, including
wood, metal, fabric, glass, hair and skin.
(aitler was also assigned to work on several of the
special effects shots in the movie. Among Ins main
interesting challenges, was creating realistic dust
particles. Cutler's team decided to c reate custom
software in order to place millions of dust spec ks in
any given shot. 1 his work, though time intensive,
allowed c ertain shots to come as dose .is possible to
real-world images In filling them with multi-parti
cle dust clouds.
Willi "I o\ Story 2 established asabox office suc
cess, C aider and Pixar have turned their attention to
wards the ni<>\ ie "Monsters. Inc." ,i twisted tale of an
unusual fac ton and its "monstrous" employees.
Working once more as a technical director, ( oi
ler is concentrating heavih on the sculpting of
human ( haracters. Most recentl\. he lias worked to
fine-tune the facial characteristics of 800 (voic ed In
Mars (abbs), a little girl who falls into the world of
the monsters.
800 ,ind the monsters — complete with horns
and fur — will come alive in movie theaters across
the country in Nov. 2001. featuring the vocal talents
of John (looclman and Bilh C.rvstal.
(.utler anticipates that Pixar will continue to
maintain its long-standing relationship with Disney
Animation Studios, leading to more projects and
films in the future. According to ( utler, with I )isiie\
handling a majority of Pixai s nun keting, the com
pany is able to locus its attention on creating innov
ative animation technology. So .ill you game-plav
ing, tov-collecting animation-loving movie-goers
out there, expect to see Pixar's masterpieces in the
aters fora long, long time to come.

Pixar headquarters is located in Richmond, Calif For
