This is the third in a series of Innovation humor

gone awry. The inspiration for this column
comes from"The Future Doesn't Need I's,"a
Wired article b\ Hill /ox, chief scientist of Sun

Like ancient herbal cures, the 20th cen
tury American alien hysteria was not all
myth.
Axe Hume, a 12-year-old human resi
dent ol Mars, was playing outside his i ural
Big ('.rater home last Thursday, June 24,
21N4, when he decided to dig across the
planet to Bigger ('.rater.
Hume unknowingly stumbled on a liv
ing, seemingly hibernating creature. I lie
creature, angry at the rude awakening, at
tacked poor 11 ume.
I lu unfortunate alien-human incident
answers the age-old question of whether
aliens exist. I hough they were widely re
garded as mere fiction, aliens are in fact
real.
Because there is enough atmosphere on
Mars to ti ansmit sound audible to humans,
we were able to talk to the alien who at
tacked Hume, known as Dobya.
Dobya spoke to our Hagey Wells, of
"Battle of the Planets" fame, through a
translator.
"Kvei since the Pathfinder landed on
|ul\ I. 1997, sending back images and
measurements li oin our surface, our world
has not been the same.
"The spacecraft consisted of a stationary
lander, used to land on the surface, and a
surface rover, used to roam about the sur
face- of the red planet. The rover, (ailed
'Sojourner,' was controlled by a human,
with a time delay of about 10 minutes.

"The spacecraft provided evidence that
there may have been an enormous flood
between I and 3 billion years before the
landing. While the temperature fluctua
tions are great on Mars, sometimes up to
20 degrees in a matter of seconds, they sus
pected life could still exist here. Well, now
they know we do. We've been try ing to ig
nore you, but now you keep bothering us.
Please go away.
Dobya was adamant about the immedi
ate discontinuation of the space program.
"I do not know the names of your Kuro
pean leaders and 1 do not follow current
events," Dobya said. "But if you do not
leave our planet alone, I will become your
president."
American attitudes towards aliens have
( hanged drastically since the early 1900s.
Between the isolationist 1920s and the
anti-( ioinmunist (lold War era, Americans
generally feared outsiders. And inflamed
images of green, evil aliens were the ulti
mate outsiders.
Fear of the outside world subsided as
Amei icans relied on immigrants and glob
alization to drive its burgeoning global
economy.
The first city in space, the International
Space Station, was a joint venture between
the I nited States, Russia, Brazil, the Euro
pean Union, (Canada and Japan. The pro
ject was started on Nov. 20, 1998, when the
Russian-built proton rocket, Zarva, was
placed into orbit to provide propulsive
control capability and provide power
through the early stages of the space sta
tion's assembly. I he stumbling Russian
economy could not continue to support
such an endeavor, however, and on July
12, 2000, Russia sent up Zvezda, its last
rot ket for the project.
Bui the first spate station was a hit in
America. Soon after the first astronauts ar

rived (Â»n ilic station, NASA made the deri
sion to open it to the public. 1 he first spat e
station sparked larger projects and soon
wealthy entrepreneurs were sent into orbit
on weekend getaways.
Ihe profitable space station pushed
NASA to come up with new and wilder
ideas, lu 2055, they opened a station on
the moon.
Opening a station on Mars was more
controversial, however, as scientists want
ed to maintain the planet lot purely scien
tific purposes.

flic possible profit margins through
tourism were too high to maintain the
planet lor purelv scientific purposes. In
21 38, the- first settlement opened on Mars.
As they explored new woi Ids without in
cident, humans began to disi egard Ibrinei
alien theories .is pure imagination.
So, naturally, citizens were shocked and
ama/.ed bv the new developments. Police
(lonnnissioner (iorton was so stunned that
he was seen shining a light into the night
skv. He was later quoted by the (losinic I ri
bune as saving th.it he wanted bis Batman.
