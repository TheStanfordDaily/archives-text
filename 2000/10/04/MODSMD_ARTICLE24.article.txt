## Stanford group is recognized for outstanding work 
### DEENA SKOLNICK EDITORIAL STAFF 
I he Stanford Society of
Women Engineers beat out more
than 300 other colleges and uni
versities to win the Society of
Women Engineers' National
Best Student Section Award this
spring, an award they recently
accepted this summer.
"I am really happy tli.it we are
being recognized for the achieve
ment,' said senior Katie Braden,
an electrical engineering major
and this year's president.
Last year, when Braden was
vice president in charge of exter
nal affairs, she wrote the group's
report for the national award.
I his award includes a $1,000
prize, which Braden said will be
used to help fund the society's out
reach events.
Braden said she feels this award
will support the society's goals of
building a community with fellow
female engineers and scientists
and providing useful and relevant
resources for personal, academic
and c areer growth.
"| I he award] reinforces how
strong a section we are," said
Ontima Wasusri, last year's presi
dent who is c urrently pursuing a
master's degree in industrial
engineering.
Wasusri explained that all the
society's sections are divided into
ten regions. Each school's society
of women engineers submits an
annual report to the region, which
c hooses its best sec tion to compete

lor the national award. Stanford
won the regional award last year,
but this is the first year the section
has won the national award.
Braden said the award will "in
spire and motivate" other schools
society sections to use Stanford's
societv as a resource and an exam
ple. She also hopes that the recog
nition will attract sponsorship
from corporations which appreci
ate the society's contributions to
the community.
"We have many wonderful
programs, and this recognition
and accompanying sponsorship
will allow us to make them bigger,
and more importantly, better,"
Braden said.
The society's programs in
clude organizing "Exploring New
Worlds," a day-long educational
competition for elementary
school students. They also admin
ister the Junior Engineering
Technical Society's test of engi
neering, math and science apti
tude to high school students.
The society invites speakers
and companies to campus for
the annual Evening with Indus
try, an opportunity for Stanford
students and faculty to network
with engineering and science
professionals.
"We try to bring in a lot of'fresh
men and keep them involved,"
Wasusri said. "Last year our mem
bership was about 200, mostly im
clergrads, with 22 officers on the
board."
Braden added that winning the
award was incredible.
"We worked hard and planned
for several years to build our sec
tion into what it. is today," she said.
The society meets even Wednes
day .it noon in Terman 556. For
