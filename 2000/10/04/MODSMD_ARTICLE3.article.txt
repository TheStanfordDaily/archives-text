Paddling to school
When Manenima decided to
leave I lis linniK in 19K2 at age 12 to
attend Is( hool, it wasn't an easy
(lei isi(>n.
1 was.in economic asset," he
s.iid." I was theben .the hunter man,
the fisherman. So in tli.it sense, it
was ,i l< >ss not < >nl\ lor the laniilv, hut
a lossol meat [hunting] from the fish
and monkeys."
Manenima said his mother, Zoila
Kscobar, did not question his deci
sion because she recognized the
long-term benefits of an education,
lu .i tribe known tor its maze-pat
terned pot ten .mil its hi iglith-col
ored clothing, the women have al
ways plaved an important role in the
( ullure. When a couple marries, it is
the man who goes to live with the
bride's family. Manenima said.
As the most influential person in

Manenima's life, his mother has
given him moral support, even from
time zones away.
"One time when I was in high
school, my mother heard that I was
sic k." Manenima said. "She took a
canoe and tame by herself, pad
dling for three days against the cur
rent to Pucallpa. She did not have
anv medicine to bring tome, but she
just came."
He studied in Pucallpa for five
years and then b< night abusticket to
Lima. He was hired as a janitor by
missionaries and later entered the
seminary.
Religion hasalwavs plavedan im
portant role in his lite, Manenima
said.
"I wanted to be a bishop," he said.
"Afterwards, though, I realized I
would not be able to cause social
c hange it I decided to dedicate my
self to the religious sphere."
Playing bamboo windpipes to
earn extra money, Manenima met
Petaluma Police C'.hief Patrick
Parks, w ho would later become his
sponsor.
In 1990,0n a missionary scholar
ship to I vler, l exas, he met Kim, a
Wisconsin-born woman w ho would
become his wife.
With Pa iks' assistance, the couple
moved to Petaluma, (lalif., where
Manenima enrolled at Sonoma
State University. I heir daughter
Vanessa w as born in 1994.

A Rotary International Scholar
ship sent Maneninia to ()xford Uni
versity fora year to study politics
and economics. Now, Maneninia at
tends Stanford with a fellowship
from the Paul and Daisy Soros
Foundation.
Fighting for recognition
Vlanenima says ihat aside from
questions about cannibalism, the
stereotvpe that he encounters most
swings toward another extreme:
the romantic view of the tranquil
and harmonious lilt- of an Amazon
tribe. The opposite is true, he said.
"Forests are destroyed, water
polluted," Maneninia said. " The
Amazon is being exploited bv gold
miners. Chiefs are ottered the land
of a village fora boat and a motor or
a machete. We face constant dis
crimination aiul prejudice."
Twenty years ago, men could
hum for one day and find monkeys,
one ol the main sources of food for
the tribe. Now it can take one week
or more.
Maneninia said that in a land
where neither civil rights nor indoor
plumbing exists, he must fight for
the survival of his people.
"I want to make sure our individ
ual and collective rights mav be re
spected giving us the political and
economic self-determination which
will be the pillars of our own sur

vival," he said.
After twice meeting with the for
mer Peruvian President Alberto Fu
jimori, Maneninia has laid the foun
dation for the first university for
Amazon Indians, La Universidad
Interculturalde la Amazonia Perua
na. Area studies will include agri
forestry, agriculture and sustainable
economy.
"Sustainability of the Amazon
economy and the adoption of West
ern concepts of preservation are
vital," Maneninia said.
In 2001, Maneninia will direct
another project. A food-processing
plant will be built in Nueva
Samaria using the steam engine
and solar power to dehydrate ba
nanas and other plants for storage
in preparation for the flood sea
son. Maneninia also wants to add
alternatives to the traditional
forms of slash-and-burn farming.
In addition, lie is applying for
grants to establish a boat clinic that
will travel from village to village.
In his spare time, Maneninia en
joys reading biographies, visiting li
braries and watching political de
bates.
Though Maneninia enjoys his
new life at Stanford, he said lie miss
es the "green tranquility of the rain
forest where "you are detached
from the fast moving world of West
ern society where life is dominated
by machines."

( ullure. When a couple marries, it is
the man who goes to live with the
bride's family. Manenima said.
As the most influential person in

Manenima's life, his mother has
given him moral support, even from
time zones away.
"One time when I was in high
school, my mother heard that I was
sic k." Manenima said. "She took a
canoe and tame by herself, pad
dling for three days against the cur
rent to Pucallpa. She did not have
anv medicine to bring tome, but she
just came."
He studied in Pucallpa for five
years and then b< night abusticket to
Lima. He was hired as a janitor by
missionaries and later entered the
seminary.

said.
"I wanted to be a bishop," he said.
"Afterwards, though, I realized I
would not be able to cause social
c hange it I decided to dedicate my
self to the religious sphere."
Playing bamboo windpipes to
earn extra money, Manenima met
Petaluma Police C'.hief Patrick
Parks, w ho would later become his
sponsor.
In 1990,0n a missionary scholar
ship to I vler, l exas, he met Kim, a
Wisconsin-born woman w ho would
become his wife.
With Pa iks' assistance, the couple
moved to Petaluma, (lalif., where
Manenima enrolled at Sonoma
State University. I heir daughter

from the Paul and Daisy Soros
Foundation.
Fighting for recognition
Vlanenima says ihat aside from
questions about cannibalism, the
stereotvpe that he encounters most
swings toward another extreme:
the romantic view of the tranquil
and harmonious lilt- of an Amazon
tribe. The opposite is true, he said.
"Forests are destroyed, water
polluted," Maneninia said. " The
Amazon is being exploited bv gold
miners. Chiefs are ottered the land
of a village fora boat and a motor or
a machete. We face constant dis
crimination aiul prejudice."
Twenty years ago, men could
hum for one day and find monkeys,
one ol the main sources of food for
the tribe. Now it can take one week
or more.
Maneninia said that in a land
where neither civil rights nor indoor
plumbing exists, he must fight for
the survival of his people.
"I want to make sure our individ
ual and collective rights mav be re
spected giving us the political and
economic self-determination which
will be the pillars of our own sur

vival," he said.
After twice meeting with the for
mer Peruvian President Alberto Fu
jimori, Maneninia has laid the foun
dation for the first university for
Amazon Indians, La Universidad
Interculturalde la Amazonia Perua
na. Area studies will include agri
forestry, agriculture and sustainable
economy.
"Sustainability of the Amazon
economy and the adoption of West
ern concepts of preservation are
vital," Maneninia said.
In 2001, Maneninia will direct
another project. A food-processing
plant will be built in Nueva
Samaria using the steam engine
and solar power to dehydrate ba
nanas and other plants for storage
in preparation for the flood sea
son. Maneninia also wants to add
alternatives to the traditional
forms of slash-and-burn farming.
In addition, lie is applying for
grants to establish a boat clinic that
will travel from village to village.
In his spare time, Maneninia en
joys reading biographies, visiting li
braries and watching political de
bates.
Though Maneninia enjoys his
new life at Stanford, he said lie miss
es the "green tranquility of the rain
forest where "you are detached
from the fast moving world of West
ern society where life is dominated
by machines."

Manenima to travel to a place

His lather, a bilingual teacher
ol Spanish and Shipibo, brought
home a disc arded copy of Nation

English or the name ol the citv,
Manenima made his decision.
"Now 1 know where white man
conies from. 1 want to go there

where he learns and get nn educa

would point to the photograph
and ask American and European
