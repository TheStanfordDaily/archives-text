Have your older
U.S. Savings
Bonds stopped
earning interest?
Many Savings Bonds issued prior
to 1970 have reached final maturity
and are no longer earning interest.
By visiting www.savingsl)onds.gov,
you can check out the Savings Bond
Calculator—a 1 RKI\ program that
tells you the current value of your
bonds, when they increase in value,
and when they stop earning interest.
• Savings Honds purchased
prior to December 1965
stop earning interest 40
years from the issue date.
• Savings Bonds and Notes
purchased after November
1965 stop earning interest
30 years from the issue date.
If your Savings Bonds are no longer
earning interest, you should redeem
them at your local financial institution.
. Or. you may exchange them for
Series HH Bonds for up to one year
past final maturity and continue to
defer the accrued interest for federal
income tax pubises*
So check it out. and put your money
back to work.
