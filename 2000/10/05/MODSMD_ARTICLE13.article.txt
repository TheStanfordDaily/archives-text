1945
On (Jctober 5, 1945, The Daily pub
lished an article called "Cal, Stanford Dele
gates Discuss School Problems.'
"Eleven Stanlord students go to Berke
ley 111 is afternoon to participate in a two
day conference with the I Diversity of (>ali
lornia on present-day problems con
fronting (lie two schools.
"Acondensation of the agenda shows
four main topics of discussion: (1) student
body and membership; (2) veterans' prob
lems; (!i) student body and administration;
.md (4) student body and faculty.
"Under these four main topic s, dele
gates from Cal and Stanford will discuss
exisiing advantages or disadvantages
under their respective school systems,
problems of readjustment to a peacetime
university life, and methods by which these
problems may be ironed out and solved."
I lowever, the headline at the top ol I he
1 )aily the next day read "It's ()llici;il! â€” No
Big (lame."
Bottom Line: Judging from this example, maybe
it's time fora new Cal-Stanford conference so
we can have a Big Game without riot police
coming in halfway through the event.
