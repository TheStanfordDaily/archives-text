I spent two miserable years at the
University of Michigan. As a fresh
man in 1976,1 was well aware that I
was a lesbian. Terrified of my secret
being discovered, I kept everyone at
arm's length. Feeling lonely and out
cast., / transferred to Stanford Uni
versity.
... I forged a gay identity.
Memories of my painful college
years have been flooding bach to me
this fall because of a far-right furor
over a wonderfully creative new Eng
lish course being taught by Universi
ty of Michigan Professor David
Halperin.
"How to Be Gay: Male Homosexu
ality and Initiation ' explores how
gay men are introduced to the shared
sensibility, culture and campy humor
that help give them the comforting
sense of belonging to a unique social
group.
