### 
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) —
In what may be an attempt to buy
time lor Slobodan Milosevic,
Yugoslavia's highest court invali
dated parts of the presidential
election yesterday after thousands
of opposition supporters forced
police to back off from seizing a
strikebound mine.
The constitutional court rul
ing, reported by the state news
agency Tanjug, came in a case
brought by the opposition —
which sought to have Vojislav
Kostunica declared the winner of
last month's election.
Instead, the court annuled
"parts" of the election, the agency
said, adding details of the ruling
would be made public today. If the
presidential vote — or even parts of
ii — must be repeated, it means
Milosevic retains power longer.
The announcement came on
the eve of a planned mass rally in
Belgrade that the opposition
hoped would be the final push to
force Milosevic to concede defeat.
Milosevic acknowledges Kostu
nica finished first in a five-candi
date field on Sept. 24 but without
a majority needed to avoid a
runoff Sunday. The opposition
has rejected a runoff.

Opposition official Goran Svi
lanovic said he believes the oppo
sition will also not agree to take
part in a rerun of the first round.
"We have our elected presi
dent," he said. "These are things
we can discuss, bin my initial reac
tion is that there can be no bar
gaining."
The opposition, challenging
the official findings of the Federal
Electoral Commission, went to
Yugoslavia's highest court earlier
Wednesday, appealing to the jus
tices to grant them victory in the
presidential elections.
The court met in emergent)
session Wednesday to hear com
plaints by the 18-party opposition
coalition, maintaining Milosevic's
supporters manipulated election
results by using a sophisticated
software program.
Opposition leaders said the\
had obtained a copy of the pro
gram and would use it to illustrate'
how the vote was rigged to favor
Milosevic's candidacy.
Earlier yesterday, Milosevic's
police abandoned barricades at a
striking coal mine 25 miles south
of Belgrade and mingled with
thousands of workers seeking to
topple the Yugoslav president.
