Privacy concerns over
Stanford list server
I would like i<> < .ill vour attention to a
serious |)ii\.i<\ problem present in the
Stanford niajordoino mailing list sys
tem. \nvonc from am e-mail account
(even outside ol Stanford) can query the
11 si server, lii st to find out which mailing
lists exist and then to obtain the e-mail
addresses ol the subscribers of almost
even list on the system.
I liis poses two distinct problems,
and I will give examples of each. Ihe
first is 111<11 members ola list are
revealed even il the) do not want their
membership or parti* i pat ion to be pub
li(. Ihe second is that one can use sim
ple statistic.il analvsis to infer connec
tions between the lists, and hence the
preferences ol groups of people.
I here are several options built into
the s\siem which are meant to prevent
ibis from happening, but they are often
not being used. Lists owners can opt to
make tlieit lists "hidden, that is their list
does not appeal on the list ol lists that
niajordoino provides. ()i tliev can make
the existence <>! the list public, but keep
the subscribers private. As of August,
there were over I,."> 00 publicly adver
tised lists. ()nl\ five percent of those lists
keep 1 1u-ii list of subscribers private.

viewable only by the list members them
selves or only In the list owner.
It seems that so many lists are public
mainly because owners are unaware ol
the list settings. In fact, when I alerted
an owner of a presumably "sensitive" list
that the list was public, the owner
replied that be did not know that list was
set up that wa\ and (hanged the access
ol the list to owner-only immediately.
Furthermore, one can argue that
even public lists which do not deal with
sensitive subjects should be kept private
m order to protet i the subscribers from
spam. For example, companies aiming
their products specifically at bikers or
photographers can query the list server
and add e-mail addresses from the
respe< live Stanford mailing lisis to their
own distribution lists.
I he second danger is that one can
inter attributes ola certain group ol
people from the lists the) subscribe to.
For example, people on the "lexas
club" mailing comprise about ten per
<ent of the "stanlbrd republicans" and
"college-republicans" mailing lists,
whit li are presumabh used In the Stan
ford College Republicans Club. I lie
lat t that anyone outside ol Stanford < an
draw these inferences about specific
groups' preferences, political and oth
erwise, has troubling implications for
Stanlbrd.

Ii appears th.it until remitlv, am list
created was In default public, (atrreiit-
Iv, am new list < reated is In default pi i
vale. I Ins is <i ver\ good policv, hut the
problem <>l the 1,000 or so existing
public lists still remains.
I his letter is intended to raise aware

ness ol the issue and hopelulh generate
some discussion. Alter .ill. some lists
should arguabb st,i\ public lot the bene
fit ol the Stanford community, lint tlie
list owners need to be aware ol the 1011-
seijuetKes ol the c lioice the\ are making
and. more importantly, that the\ liaye a

choice in the first place. IT you have at
