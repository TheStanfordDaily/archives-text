### JEFFREY TAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council
met yesterday in die Bechtel Inter
national Center to discuss gradu
ate student housing. The council
members also outlined their prior
ities for the year.
Political Science Doctoral stu
dent Mary Lee Kimber, the coun
cil's unofficial housing issues rep
resentative, discussed the recent
developments in new housing. She
said the current administration is
putting "a lot more commitment
here, more than I've seen in the
past."
She characterized the adminis
tration as confident of adding
housing for 319 graduate students
in Escondido Village by fall 2002.
The University also anticipates
adding another 240 beds as well as
a Graduate (Community ('.enter by
Fall 2003, she said.
According to Kimber, the Uni
versity's cumulative goal is to add
1,000 new net beds in Escondido
Village by 2005.
Any new graduate housing alter
that will be built elsewhere, as Es
condido Village will be too crowd
ed to absorb further housing units.
Some council members raised
concerns about construction noise
for the next few years, but Kimber
said that adjusting construction
hours around the schedules of stu
dents would ultimately mean long
construction delays, which are in
fcasible because of the current
housing crunch.
Kimber said that "since the be
ginning of September [the Univer
sity has] been much more coopera
tive" in discussing the issue of

graduate student housing.
The council also discussed the
EuroMed Party, which will be held
at the Coflee House on Oct. 14.
I he party, which is co-sponsored
by the council, will feature Euro
pean and Mediterranean music.
In addition, the council dis
cussed funding for various gradu
ate student groups such as Pakista
nis at Stanford and Alpha Phi
Omega, the community service
fraternity.
Council chairman Paul Hartke,
a doctoral student in Electrical En
gineering, said another priority lor
the council this year will be "health
care, in terms of prescription drug
costs at Cowell, especially with the
changes in Cardinal Care."
In addition, with graduate stu
dents staying at Stanford longer
and growing older, c hild care will
bean important issue, lie said.
Physics Doctoral student Kalch
Midland, last year's council c hair,
agreed that housing, along with
the future of the General Use Per
mit, would be paramount on the
council's list of concerns and issues
to discuss.
"Until the final General Use
Permit and community plan are in
set in stone, we'll be lot using on
that since that will guide Stanford
on how much housing they'll be
building," he said.
I lartke said that he was pleased
that another child-care lac i 1 it\
would be built in Escondido Vil
lage, and that he was happy that
progress was being made on most
of the major issues confronting t lie
body.
The council meets ever)
Wednesday at f> p.m. at the Bet h
tel International (Icnter.
