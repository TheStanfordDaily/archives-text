# Salamander could make endangered list
## 
### NICHOLAS CHAN 
The federal government may soon
add the tiger salamander Ibund in
Lake Lagunita and the Foothills to its
endangered species list. The salaman
der is currently a California state
"species of special concern."
A studv being conducted by UC-
Davis Evolution and Ecology Prof.
Brad Shaffer will determine the sala
manders status.
Shatter has collected DNA sequence
data from hundreds of tiget salaman
ders throughout California. Over the
next six months, he will analyze this
data to determine if the Lake Lagunita
species is distinct from the others.
Scientists do not currently know
whether the local species is genetically
distinct. Ihev have determined that

liger salamander populations neat
Sonoma ami Santa Barbara are unique.
II the Stanford species is found to be
genetically distinct, the federal govern
ment will place it on the endangered
species list, potentially forcing a series
of environmental reforms throughout
the campus.
Under federal law, the University
may have to create a I labitat (Conserva
tion Plan, restricting certain salaman
der-harming activities on campus in
order to protect the salamander and
other endangered species that li\e on
c ampus. These species include the ba\
checkerspot butterfly, the steelhead
trout and the Mexican free tailed bat.
Alan Launer, a biologist at Stan
ford's ( enter for Conservation biol
ogy, said he doubts anything the
University does would threaten cn

dangered spec ies to the extent that a
Habitat Conservation Plan would be
required.
On campus, c hanges have already
been made to accommodate the sala

mander. In 1991, the pre-Big Game
bonfire was moved from Lake Laguni
i.i to protect the salamanders.

The bonfire had been a Stan
lord tradition, and many students
protested its cancellation.
1 lie Univesity still cites the pro
tection of the salamander as a rea
son for not officially reinstating the
bonfires.
I lie salamander does threaten
tentative projects near Junipero
Serra Boulevard that are part of
Stanford's pending land use plan.
Because the planned housing and
academic development will occu
py land and require construction

equipment, these projects might
have to be relocated so as not to
threaten the salamander.
Launer said that extinction of
the salamander "would make the
campus less interesting and take
away an excellent foe its for under
graduate research."
The California tiger salaman
der lives in grasslands and wood
land areas.
A seasonally variable water level
is essential to the salamander's sur
vival. Lake Lagunita and the sur
rounding lands lit these qualifica
tions.
In California, over half of the
lands that comprise the salaman
der's habitat have been developed
or turned into vineyards.
