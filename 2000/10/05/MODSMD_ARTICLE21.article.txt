The Notre Dame Fighting
Irish will host a formidable Car
dinal team in tomorrow's Cross
Country Invitational in South
Bend, lud.
The No. 1 Stanford women's
cross country team will invade
I he Midwest tomorrow as the
strongest team competing in the
None Dame Cross Country
Invitational.
Including the Cardinal, thir
ty teams entered the meet,
headlined by N0.5 North Car
olina State, No. 13 Michigan
and No. 24 Duke.
Having captured three victo
ries already in the season, top

ranked Stanford continues to
build momentum as it plows
through the season.
In last weekend's Stanford
Invitational, the Cardinal im
pressively placed three runners
in the top ten to win the meet
with 61 points.
Washington trailed in second
with 91 points, as the lowest
scores win the meet.
The event, held at the Stan

first opportunity this season to
compete with other upper-eche
lon schools such as No. 2 Wis
consin and No. 3 Kansas State.

In last year's Stanford Invitational at the Stanford Golf Course, sopho
more Lauren Fleshman ran to a fourth-place finish. She will return from
injury tomorrow in the Notre Dame Cross Country Invitational.
Dame, the Stanford Invitational
foes in the Badgers and the Wild
cats are not slated to compete, al
though No. 5-ranked North Car
olina State should provide a quali
ty challenge to the- (lardinal.
"We're putting together two
Â«,olicl line-ups for the next two
weekends," said assistant coach
I Jena Evans.
The other meet to which Evans
refers is the pre-NCAA Champi
onship meet at lowa State
I diversity.
These upcoming competitions
are Stanford's opportunity to con
tinue to lest the depth of its team
and the capabilities of its runners.
Although senior Julia Stamps
will not run at Notre Dame, sopho
more Lauren Fleshman will re
turn to the Stanford attack.
Redshirt junior team captain

Elena Villareal will also not run in
the upcoming meet.
Returning to action from last
weekend are freshman Jillian
Mastroianni, sophomore Erin
Sullivan, redshirt sopohomore
Malincli Elmore, redshirt fresh
man Lindsay Hyatt, junior
Collen Flaherty and junior Ann
Ramsey.
Other competing teams, in
cluding Notre Dame, are relying
on 112 reshman faces to help carry the
team. Strong additions to the
Fighting Irish have proved
beneficial so far in preliminary
competitions.
Similarly, new freshman addi
tions to the Stanford team such as
Victoria ('hang and Jillian Mas
troianni have proved advanta
geous as they've demonstrated
their team spirit and competitive
edge, especially in last weekend's
meet.
Chang ran strong to finish
eighth, just after Villareal, placing
her in the last of the top three Stan

lord spots. Mastroianni plated
fourth 011 the team with a powerful
finish as well.
Both Chang and Mastroianni
have adjusted well to collegiate
cross country.
"The biggest difference be
tween tnv high school and college
experience," said Mastroianni, "is
that I was always used to training
with both the guys and girls.
"At Stanford the girls train to
gether which really aids in the
unity of the team."
Working together as a team is
the main goal of women's cross
country this year, said Viallareal.
"We're a very young team," she
said, "and we're taking a smarter,
more conservative approach to
running this year.
"We're working lor our team to
continue to function as a cohesive
unit."
The Cardinal continues to im
prove each meet, which is the goal
heading into November's NCAA
National (lhampionships.
