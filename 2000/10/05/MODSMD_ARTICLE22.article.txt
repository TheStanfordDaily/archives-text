# Cardinal road show heads east to challenge tough field in South Bend
## Cross country will compete in Notre Dame Invitational 
### BEN ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
Less than one week after a tremen
dously successful season-opener at the
Stanford Invitational, the No. 2 Cardinal
men will take their show on the road to
morrow, competing at the Notre Dame
Invitational in South Bend, Ind.
There, Stanford will face five of the
nation's other top-25 ranked teams, in
i'hiding No. 8 North Carolina State, No.
10 Arizona, No. 22 Notre Dame, No. 23
Duke and No. 24 Eastern Michigan. 1 he
entire field rounds out to 22 teams.
Stanford's truncated schedule rarely
allows time for more than a couple invi
tational meets outside of its champi
onship-race-heavy format.
Add the fact that most major meets

are held east of the Rocky Mountains,
and the (Cardinal ends up having to (rav
el extensively just to face ranked compe
tition outside the Pacific 10 Conference.
Notre Dame should provide just the
opportunity Stanford is after — solid
competition with an extremely flat and
fast course, conditions that are likely to
produce extremely fast limes, weather
permitting.
Likely to open their seasons in Indi
ana are senior Thomas Murley and
sophomores Andy Powell and Seih
Hejny, all of whom made significant
strides on the track during spring that
should translate well to the trails.
Expect that trio to join senior jonathon
Riley in the race for the individual title,
while sophomore Adam Tenlbrde and
rcdshirt freshman Louis Luc hini should
help (ill out the (Cardinal pack.
The team did not release word this
week on the status of Stanford's three
freshmen, all of whom continued to red
shirt during the Stanford Invitational.
Lan Dobson, Donald Sage and (Chris

E,mme all raced to times that would have
placed them among the Cardinal's top
seven in last Saturday's open race.
Though Stanford's trouncing of the
18-team field at home lasi weekend was
impressive — the C Cardinal scored just 2H
points to second-place Santa Barbara's
118 — the team has yet to be tested
against ranked competition.
Adams State (Colorado), perennially
among the top two Division 11 schools at na
tionals. and North (Central (Illinois), usual
ly Division Ill's strongest team, should also
give chase at this weekend's title.
Though racing conditions in the Mid
west are notoriously volatile, the meet
will perhaps serve best as a primer for
the NCAA meet, slated for Nov. 20 in
Ames, lowa.
Stanford will preview that venue ()ct.
14, though the race will cover eight kilo
meters as opposed to the NCAA Nation
al standard 10.
Tomorrow's race, also slated to cover
8,000 meters, will begin at 2 p.m. Pacific
lime on Notre Dame's home course.
