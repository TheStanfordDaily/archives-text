Because the Band is. . . awesome.

A: I hey're an amazing group. I've alwa\s idolized
them from alar, hut being free is the first I've had
to do with them. For me, I have, like, .1 vote in

much as we possibly can, 'cause we onl\ have one
year. And, ahh! I lie Band is . . . ama/ing.
Q: What's it like lobe the first girl free in l~> years?
A: I'm not a i. I'm not <1 girl (pauses, laughs).
()kav, I am a girl. It's very awe-inspiring. I mean,
when you first walk into the Band, you're like "I
don't know what the hell's going on."
And it was really cool 10 walk in with the girls be
cause it's hard i<> get to know girls on campus,
which is win I joined a sorority— I'm a [Kappa
Kappa (iammaj — because its like ibis competition
thing, which is really bizarre. Bui when I joined the

You probably won't believe it. When (1C was 7, he
had a great-uncle. His nephew doesn't have a
great-uncle. So (1(1 decided he would have to do
the great-uncle thing for his nephew.
(:(told me about this weird American tradition.
When you're 7 years old, when you're a bloke, yom
uncle has to bury vou in the basement and hit you
with boiled cabbages. To me it sounds like a com
pletely perverted tradition. We don't do such
strange things in Lngland. (.(i needed niv help
'cause he doesn't have a car.
In his Hat he had ail these cabbages and I was
like, "What . . . are all of these all about?!" So we
piled all these cabbages in my car, and we drove
over to this guy's house and I stall cutting oil the
stems and sticking these cabbages in to boil lor his
