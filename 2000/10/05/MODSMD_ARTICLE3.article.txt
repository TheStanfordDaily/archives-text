It's really kind ol embarrassing. Okay. Do yon

years ago. I le goes bv (XI. And it's really bizarre.
You probably won't believe it. When (1C was 7, he

great-uncle. So (1(1 decided he would have to do
the great-uncle thing for his nephew.
(:(told me about this weird American tradition.
When you're 7 years old, when you're a bloke, yom
uncle has to bury vou in the basement and hit you

pletely perverted tradition. We don't do such
strange things in Lngland. (.(i needed niv help
'cause he doesn't have a car.
In his Hat he had ail these cabbages and I was
like, "What . . . are all of these all about?!" So we
piled all these cabbages in my car, and we drove
over to this guy's house and I stall cutting oil the
stems and sticking these cabbages in to boil lor his

nephew.
Meanwhile, CC is burying his
nephew in the basement. Hoys are
so weird! Anyway, (1(1 came back
and got i he boiled cabbages from
me, and then, like, started hilling
his nephew with these boiled cab
bages. Ihe kid looked kinda
scared — you know, he was, like,
hung by his wrists in the basement.
I can't eat cabbage now. 1 can't go
near it.
Q: What's your major?
A: My major. Product design.
When I took over as Free last
spring from Kv (Evan Meagher),
wearing last year's costume — you
make your new costume over the
summer—Ev's costume weighs
122 pounds! Kv is not a product
design major. My costume weighs
5 pounds. It weighs nothing. It's
awesome.
Q: Why weren't you ,it the first lew
games of the football season?
A: I couldn't get back. Let's just
leave n that. I couldn't get back. I
was stuck in England. I was back in
England for the summer, (pause)
Things happened.
Q: Are you looking forward to lull
Moon on the Quad this year?
A: I'm shooting lor four digits. Ev
got like f>oo. I've got to beat that.
What can you do about get ins and
st nil?! It kind of goes with the job.
It should be pretty (001.
Q: I thought the British were more
dignified.
A: I'm not British. Actually, I was
born in Tennessee. No, no.
(laughs) I'm British. I'm English.
|The Band] just told me to pull

something over whoever inter
viewed me, but I can't... do it.
(laughs) No, 1 am. I grew up in
England. 1 only c ame out here lor
university.
Q: Do you live with your "tree"
aunts in England?
A: My dad was one of six. I hey
kind of grew up in the middle of
nowhere. The three guys ended
up marrying people, but the three
girls didn't. They still live together
and when I became free they were
like, "We're the l ree aunts!"
Q: As a key member of the Band
and a big British girl, your toler
ance to alcohol must be quite high
now.
A: Mv tolerance is up there. Now
that I'm back with the Band again,
my tolerance is up there. 1 can take
a lot of people. I can take most peo
ple on campus.
I'm from England — we prefer
beer to liquor. I could quite happi
ly drink 30 beers a clay. 1 don't like
shots in many respects, but I drink
them, you know, when I have to.
Q: What's your favorite kind of
beer?
A: Favorite beer? Stella Artois. It's .
. . it's a very good beer. It's very
easy to drink.
Q: Is there an endless supply of al
cohol in the Band Shak?
A: I love the Band. Let's leave it at
that. I love the Band.
Q: How lias being I ree helped
your dating prospects?
A: I have a boyfriend. We've been
going out lor nearly a year. He's
cool. I le's really cool. Full Moon is
gonna be interesting. We'll see if
he lines up. (laughs)
Q: Let's talk about your stunts. In
a re-enactment of Michael jack

son's Thriller video last year, you
played Michael Jackson and were
shot at with a real bullet. That must
have been scary.
A: That was really scary. The
whole beforehand thing was like,
"Just shoot low, aim low." I had a
vest. It was one of my freshmen.
I le's been shooting fora lew years.
We had tested out the vest. When
we tried that, I was so nervous.
Real bullets. But when it came
down to it, it just worked. I was
like," I le knows where to shoot me,
he knows how to shoot, it's okay."
I le didn't drink fora reason. He's
underage!
Q: You also paraglided from
I loover lower?
A: Yes, 1 did that. We did it at
night. You can get up there at
night if you know the way in
through the steam tunnels. Now
they've blocked it oil. I paraglided
from the top at, like, 3 in the morn
ing. It wasn't my coolest one,
though. My Houdini one was.
Houdini did this thing where he
chained his right wrist to his left
ankle, and his left wrist to his right
ankle, and then was dropped in a
pool of water. We did it in
deC'.uerre Pool in the middle of the
night.
It was very unpublicized be
cause you're not allowed to do any
thing life-endangering, so we
didn't want it to get out. But where
I went to school in England, we
were next door to a circus, so you
learned lots of tricks. But I had
never gotten out of locks [while I
was] underwater.
It was really cool. You're al
lowed untilminutes underwater
before you get brain damage.
There were only about a do/en
people there. It was really cool. It
took me about 2:40.
Q: What's your favorite sport to

rally at as Tree?
A: Uinm . . . football should be
fun. The crowds are huge. Volley
ball — girls' volleyball — is weird,
because they're my girls, and for
the first time I'm watching them. I
used to play volleyball at Stanford,
my freshman and sophomore
years, so it's weird.
I'm scared of Big Game. Did
you know, Big Game s on my
birthday this year?! It's destiny!
Football! Americans can't bloody
call it football. Look: foot, ball. I he
two do not connect in American
football. Americans are so weird!
Q: Are you the tallest person in
your family?
A: Yes. (laughs) 6'2". I'm the
tallest. My brother used to live in
New York. 1 le was actually the one
who told me about Stanford. It's
weird: I've always had this thing
lor trees. Anyway, he heard about
the l ree mascot at Stanford, and
so he called me and told me about
it.
I had always wanted to come
out to the U.S. because of volley
ball. Volleyball's really not big in
England — I was on the national
team, so I wanted to play in the
U.S. So he told me about this
American school that had a good
volleyball team and a tree as a mas
cot.
Q: Did you have a crazy freshman
year?
A: I drank, (pause) I drank. A lot. 1
wasn't used to not drinking, 'cause
you ch ink in England.
Q: Do you have any tattoos or un
usual piercings?
A: Piercings, no. I have an English
rose [tattoo].
Q: Can I see?
A: No. (laughs) And I'm gonna get
a tree [tattoo].

and got i he boiled cabbages from
me, and then, like, started hilling
his nephew with these boiled cab
bages. Ihe kid looked kinda
scared — you know, he was, like,
hung by his wrists in the basement.
I can't eat cabbage now. 1 can't go
near it.
Q: What's your major?
A: My major. Product design.
When I took over as Free last
spring from Kv (Evan Meagher),
wearing last year's costume — you
make your new costume over the
summer—Ev's costume weighs
122 pounds! Kv is not a product
design major. My costume weighs
5 pounds. It weighs nothing. It's
awesome.
Q: Why weren't you ,it the first lew
games of the football season?
A: I couldn't get back. Let's just
leave n that. I couldn't get back. I
was stuck in England. I was back in
England for the summer, (pause)
Things happened.
Q: Are you looking forward to lull
Moon on the Quad this year?
A: I'm shooting lor four digits. Ev
got like f>oo. I've got to beat that.
What can you do about get ins and
st nil?! It kind of goes with the job.
It should be pretty (001.
Q: I thought the British were more
dignified.
A: I'm not British. Actually, I was
born in Tennessee. No, no.
(laughs) I'm British. I'm English.
|The Band] just told me to pull

something over whoever inter
viewed me, but I can't... do it.
(laughs) No, 1 am. I grew up in
England. 1 only c ame out here lor
university.
Q: Do you live with your "tree"
aunts in England?
A: My dad was one of six. I hey
kind of grew up in the middle of
nowhere. The three guys ended
up marrying people, but the three
girls didn't. They still live together
and when I became free they were
like, "We're the l ree aunts!"
Q: As a key member of the Band
and a big British girl, your toler
ance to alcohol must be quite high
now.
A: Mv tolerance is up there. Now
that I'm back with the Band again,
my tolerance is up there. 1 can take
a lot of people. I can take most peo
ple on campus.
I'm from England — we prefer
beer to liquor. I could quite happi
ly drink 30 beers a clay. 1 don't like
shots in many respects, but I drink
them, you know, when I have to.
Q: What's your favorite kind of
beer?
A: Favorite beer? Stella Artois. It's .
. . it's a very good beer. It's very
easy to drink.
Q: Is there an endless supply of al
cohol in the Band Shak?
A: I love the Band. Let's leave it at
that. I love the Band.
Q: How lias being I ree helped
your dating prospects?
A: I have a boyfriend. We've been
going out lor nearly a year. He's
cool. I le's really cool. Full Moon is
gonna be interesting. We'll see if
he lines up. (laughs)
Q: Let's talk about your stunts. In
a re-enactment of Michael jack

son's Thriller video last year, you
played Michael Jackson and were
shot at with a real bullet. That must
have been scary.
A: That was really scary. The
whole beforehand thing was like,
"Just shoot low, aim low." I had a
vest. It was one of my freshmen.
I le's been shooting fora lew years.
We had tested out the vest. When
we tried that, I was so nervous.
Real bullets. But when it came
down to it, it just worked. I was
like," I le knows where to shoot me,
he knows how to shoot, it's okay."
I le didn't drink fora reason. He's
underage!
Q: You also paraglided from
I loover lower?
A: Yes, 1 did that. We did it at
night. You can get up there at
night if you know the way in
through the steam tunnels. Now
they've blocked it oil. I paraglided
from the top at, like, 3 in the morn
ing. It wasn't my coolest one,
though. My Houdini one was.
Houdini did this thing where he
chained his right wrist to his left
ankle, and his left wrist to his right
ankle, and then was dropped in a
pool of water. We did it in
deC'.uerre Pool in the middle of the
night.
It was very unpublicized be
cause you're not allowed to do any
thing life-endangering, so we
didn't want it to get out. But where
I went to school in England, we
were next door to a circus, so you
learned lots of tricks. But I had
never gotten out of locks [while I
was] underwater.
It was really cool. You're al
lowed untilminutes underwater
before you get brain damage.
There were only about a do/en
people there. It was really cool. It
took me about 2:40.
Q: What's your favorite sport to

rally at as Tree?
A: Uinm . . . football should be
fun. The crowds are huge. Volley
ball — girls' volleyball — is weird,
because they're my girls, and for
the first time I'm watching them. I
used to play volleyball at Stanford,
my freshman and sophomore
years, so it's weird.
I'm scared of Big Game. Did
you know, Big Game s on my
birthday this year?! It's destiny!
Football! Americans can't bloody
call it football. Look: foot, ball. I he
two do not connect in American
football. Americans are so weird!
Q: Are you the tallest person in
your family?
A: Yes. (laughs) 6'2". I'm the
tallest. My brother used to live in
New York. 1 le was actually the one
who told me about Stanford. It's
weird: I've always had this thing
lor trees. Anyway, he heard about
the l ree mascot at Stanford, and
so he called me and told me about
it.
I had always wanted to come
out to the U.S. because of volley
ball. Volleyball's really not big in
England — I was on the national
team, so I wanted to play in the
U.S. So he told me about this
American school that had a good
volleyball team and a tree as a mas
cot.
Q: Did you have a crazy freshman
year?
A: I drank, (pause) I drank. A lot. 1
wasn't used to not drinking, 'cause
you ch ink in England.
Q: Do you have any tattoos or un
usual piercings?
A: Piercings, no. I have an English
rose [tattoo].
Q: Can I see?
A: No. (laughs) And I'm gonna get
a tree [tattoo].
