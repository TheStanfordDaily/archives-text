A major in psychology? A concentra

I liese are questions many ihird-year
undergraduate students llnd them
selves asking as they return to the Farm
this (all.
But they'll have to make a decision
quickly — Stanford juniors who have not
yet declared a major will soon lac e pres
sure Irom the Undergraduate Advising
C lenter to do so.
Fall quarter is traditionally the last
quarter that undeclared juniors are per
mitted to register.
Undeclared juniors already received
one letter from the University during
the summer, prompting them to consid
er their ac ademic interests and c hoose a

course of study.
Fall quarter is an "automatic grace
period" between the ollic ial deadline to
declare, the end ol sophomore year, and
the enforcement oi the deadline'.
By the end of the quarter, the c enter
will send letters out to undeclared |ti
niors, warning them that their winter
quarter registration will he put on hold
unless the\ declare.
Undeclared junioi Klizaheth lan
noun is Irving to decide between major
ing in Anthropology and Psychology.
This summer she received a letter from
the center advising her to declare a
major, and she plans to do so this fall
after taking a lew more classes in each
discipline.
"It's kind of scarv to dec lare," Fan
noun said. "I know you can change ma
jors, but [declaring] si ill seems somehow

final."
Fannoun agrees thai two years is
enough lime lo decide on a major, Iml
said six- has wailed lo avoid whal seems
like a formidable process.
Senior I .eia Sution-Barnes found the
entire process of declaring a major to be
a hassle.
By spring ol her sophomore year,
Sutton-Barnes had completed the
Human Biology core and submitted a
proposal to the program, a required
part of the process for human biology
majors. I lowevei. she siill hadn't dec id
ed on an adviser, and In the lime she
completed her proposal laic spring
quarter, some of the professors she was
considering had already left campus.
The following fall, while studying
abroad in Santiago, Chile, she re
ceived an e-mail message warning
her that il she did not dec lare, she
would not be allowed to register
winter quarter.
Sutton-Barnes was forced to
choose an adviser and declare
quickly. Fortunate!). she found <111
accompanying professor on the
Santiago n ip who had expertise 111
her area of interest and agreed 10
advise her.
"I understand whv they want us
to declare, but I know several
11 hid Bio majors who have com
pleted the core and had to declare
some other major 10 meet the
deadline," slu- said.

Sutton-Barnes also said these
students declare a different major
in order to buy extra time to refine
their concentration and choose an
adviser within the I luman Biology
Department.
According to the center's Web
site, Stanford's conviction that the
choice of academic concentration
is best made after exploring a
range of courses is upheld, but the
exploration period is limited to the
first two years lor two reasons.
First, (he declaration and com
pletion of a major is required to
graduate and the University wants
to ensure tli.it students are able to
graduate in lour years.
Second, the center is not stalled
to advise students for more than
two years. The c enter assumes that
by junior year, students will have a

lew adviser wilhin their < liosen
lepartment instead of then lu sh
nan adviser.
The University defines ,i ' ju

According to Registrar Rogci

Priniup, the regulation of major
declaration reflects certain as
sumptions about Stanford under
graduates.
Most Stanford students gradu

students who stop out do so after
