### MARK BOUCHER EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Bio-X program awarded oyer million in
grants to 19 Stanford faculty members this week lot
interdisciplinary resean h projects and courses in bi
ology, medicine, computer science and engineering.
The chosen proposals will receive an average of
$ 158,000 over a two-year period as a seed grant. Alter
this two-year period, researc hers will have to obtain
independent funding to continue their projec is.
1 lie Bio-X Interdisciplinary Initiatives Program
Committee, formed hist spring, chose these 19 pro
posals out of 85 submitted.
"We were looking for faculty-initiated, truly inter
disciplinary, research or educational initiatives that
could not be done by one group alone but required
two disciplines to carry it," said Pediatrics Prof. Har
vey (lohen, the committee chair.
()ne proposal will combine radiology and artific i.il
intelligence to allow computers to interpret medical
images such as (1A I scans.
According to one of the project's leaders, Asst.
Computer Science Prof. Carlo Fomasi, computers
can process the incredibly large amounts of data
found in these images more efficiently and accurate
ly than a doctor could bv looking.
lomasi and his collaborators, Vsst. Radiology
Prof. Carlos Beaulieu and Assoc. Radiology Prof.
Sandy Napel, describe the project as "augmented
human intelligence."
I oinasi said that the project would not have been
possible without the $170,000 of funding from the
Bio-X program.
"It brings together people from the diflerent
schools," fomasi said. "It's a very interdisciplinary
program."
fomasi has volunteered to move into the pro
gram's building, known as the (Hark ('.enter, when n
opens and said he hopes to work on several future
Bio-X projects.
I he grants also c overed engineering-related pro
jects such as a study ol coral reefs and their impa< t on
global climate change. Ibis project will investigate
the exchange of carbon dioxide between coral reels
and the water.
" There are tremendous opportunities loi collabo
rative research [with Bio-X], said Medicine Prof.
Jane Parties.
Several professors also received a SI 70,000 grant
to create a new course for graduate students called
"Introduction to Medical Sciences." I lie course will
introduce graduate students in biology and engi
neering to basic concepts ol tncdi< ine and disease.
