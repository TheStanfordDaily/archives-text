# Bio-X grants $3 million for projects
## 
### MARK BOUCHER EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Bio-X program awarded oyer million in
grants to 19 Stanford faculty members this week lot
interdisciplinary resean h projects and courses in bi
ology, medicine, computer science and engineering.
The chosen proposals will receive an average of
$ 158,000 over a two-year period as a seed grant. Alter
this two-year period, researc hers will have to obtain
independent funding to continue their projec is.
1 lie Bio-X Interdisciplinary Initiatives Program
Committee, formed hist spring, chose these 19 pro
posals out of 85 submitted.
"We were looking for faculty-initiated, truly inter
disciplinary, research or educational initiatives that
could not be done by one group alone but required
two disciplines to carry it," said Pediatrics Prof. Har
vey (lohen, the committee chair.
()ne proposal will combine radiology and artific i.il
intelligence to allow computers to interpret medical
images such as (1A I scans.
According to one of the project's leaders, Asst.
Computer Science Prof. Carlo Fomasi, computers
can process the incredibly large amounts of data
found in these images more efficiently and accurate
ly than a doctor could bv looking.
lomasi and his collaborators, Vsst. Radiology
Prof. Carlos Beaulieu and Assoc. Radiology Prof.
Sandy Napel, describe the project as "augmented
human intelligence."
I oinasi said that the project would not have been
possible without the $170,000 of funding from the
Bio-X program.
"It brings together people from the diflerent
schools," fomasi said. "It's a very interdisciplinary
program."
fomasi has volunteered to move into the pro
gram's building, known as the (Hark ('.enter, when n
opens and said he hopes to work on several future
Bio-X projects.
I he grants also c overed engineering-related pro
jects such as a study ol coral reefs and their impa< t on
global climate change. Ibis project will investigate
the exchange of carbon dioxide between coral reels
and the water.
" There are tremendous opportunities loi collabo
rative research [with Bio-X], said Medicine Prof.
Jane Parties.
Several professors also received a SI 70,000 grant
to create a new course for graduate students called
"Introduction to Medical Sciences." I lie course will
introduce graduate students in biology and engi
neering to basic concepts ol tncdi< ine and disease.
According to Parries, the course
will give engineers a basic under
standing of medicine so they can
identify areas of medical research
where they might use their engi
neering training.
"The course will incorporate
new technologies into teaching, in
cluding simulation software," said
Parties. "[Bio-X] is an excellent
source of'funding because if fits ex
actly with what we're doing."
According to Parties, the Bio-X
funding allowed her and her col
leagues to develop the course
more quickly and to add features
such as the simulation software.
" I lie committee reallv feels that

these 19 grants will help define
where Bio-X is going, because all
of the proposals came straight
from the faculty," Cohen said in
the Stanford Report.
The committee hopes to fund
other projects in the future if they
can find other sources of money,
Cohen said.
This $3-million grant springs
from a $150 million gilt from for
mer Netscape Communications
executive and engineering profes
sor Jim Clark specifically for the
creation of the Bio-X program.
Last spring, $7 million of the
grant was used to upgrade re
search facilities and laboratories.
Clark's $150-million donation
last October was the largest the
University lias received since its
founding.
