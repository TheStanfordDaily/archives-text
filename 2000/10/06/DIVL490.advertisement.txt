I was .1 guest at your restaurant and I chose to rat
two of your specials and they were excellent One
was the com soup with cumin. Would you lx
willing to send me the recipe?
I liked II mi much that I would enjoy preparing it for
my husband. (I'm not a good enough cook to
prepare the main course, the grilled dorado, hut 1
compliment you on that as well)
I look forward to my next meat at l*ro Bono. I shall
recommend your restaurant to my friends in the
San Franc isco area.
