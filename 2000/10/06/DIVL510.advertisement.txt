At Ford Motor Company, protecting the environment is one of our most important
initiatives. That's why Heidi is so important to our future.
As the daughter of an engineer, Heidi grew up in the Ford family. From day one,
she knew about our commitment to automobiles. She didn't know that our
commitment to the environment was just as impressive.
The fact is, Heidi's environmental goals and ours are one in the same.
Through the Ford College Internship Program, Heidi had the opportunity to
experience our environmental protection efforts first-hand. From closing
underground storage tanks to taking our waste minimization efforts to new levels,
her ideas made a real impact.
As it turns out, her internship was just the beginning.
Since joining the company full-time in 1998, Heidi has coordinated important
environmental projects with a team of engineers - including the restoration of local
waterways. Today she serves as the environmental contact for seven assembly
plants and four other facilities located in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.
Thanks to people like Heidi, we're working smarter and safer than ever before.
