lighted the annual freshman vs. sopho
more mud light.
"Postponed lot a week, the annual
freshman-sophomore mud classic is now
definitely scheduled for next Thursday af
ternoon on iht* freshman loothall Held.
"Although greatly outnumbered by the
enlarged freshman ( lass, sophomore lead
ers are relying on brain and organization to
overcome the brawn and manpower boast
ed by the liosli. Ralph Slaver, sophomore
president, and Aylett (lotion, newly ap
pointed soph captain, urge every sopho
