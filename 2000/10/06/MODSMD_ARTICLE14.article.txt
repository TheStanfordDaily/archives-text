It was a down year on the Palo Alto
campus: Golf, tennis and volleyball
eame in second at the NCAA champi
onships, and swimming, cross-country
and water polo finished third nation
ally. O.K., make that a relatively down
year; the school has won more NCAA
women's team championships (25)
and total NCAA titles (78), and has
more alums in the WNBA (13) than
any other
..There are world-class people in
every department," says women"s
swimming coach Richard Quick. "We
don't put athletes on a pedestal." No
need to: They're standing tall without
one.
