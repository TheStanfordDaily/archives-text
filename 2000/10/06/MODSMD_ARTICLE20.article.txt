I his year, most undergraduates on campus
will have the opportunity to participate in their
first presidential election. I nfbrtunately, il this
vcai s election is similar to past years', most stu
dents will decline to participate.
In 19%, only 18.8 percent of the registered
voters in Stanford precincts cast their ballots.
In 1998, the turnout was only 36 percent.
Perhaps students are not satisfied with the
(lioit e of candidates. Some max be reluctant to
participate in what main call a "two-party dic

tatorship" where the issues are blurred and
no-one seems to want to take a real stance on
either side of the lence. Maybe you are won
dering why you should vote at all.
You do a disservice to yourself and youi
community if you turn your back on the ballot.
If vou think the issues involved in the election
are irrelevant, take a look at the diHering posi
tions the candidates hold concerning public
education, environmental policc and health
care. The outcome of the election will direct
policy in these and other areas for the next

If you are discontented with the presidential
choices, think about vour vote as one lor the
next Supreme Court justices. Many people

Do not take your vote for granted. It wasn't
until 1920 that the 19th amendment granted
women the right to vote. The 19()5 Voting
Rights Act, which effectively prohibited voting
laws that discriminated against minorities
(spec ificallv African-Americans at that time),

would not have had il not for the freedom
fighters during the Civil Rights Era.
In honor of their struggle, we should rec
ognize the power and the legacy of our vote.
Voting is one of our most basic rights as Amer
ican citizens. Ignoring this right takes away
from the intent of'democracy to empower the
people to lead. Now is the time to remember
what suffrage activists understood so deeply:
Voting affords the opportunity to shape policy
decisons that ultimately impact all our lives.
Voting is a responsibility entitled to us and
entrusted to us to shape the future of our polit
ical system. Most importantly, voting is our
