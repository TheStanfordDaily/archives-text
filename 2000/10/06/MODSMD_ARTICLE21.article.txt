Foothills Liberation Front protests
Dish regulations
I lie Foothills .in- alive with the sound
ol students!
Special thanks to Stanford I niversitv,
whi< h ie< entlx (and grac iouslv) amended
iis night-time use policv ol the Foothills
distii<t to allow the Foothill Liberation
Front's hike to the Dish.
Last night's hike demonstrates two
important lacets of the relationship
between Stanford students and our
adininistiative < aretakers:
1. Ihe I 11 i\crsit\ seems more than
willing to open the Dish up to night hikes,
provided one lias a group exceeding 200
in number.
2. I he I niversit\ does not want any
pit •ss on kind use issues w ln< Ii illuminates
the position ol hundreds ol its students;
namely, that the I niversitv's restrictions
to Dish access have enjoyed weak and
tired justifications .it best and that such
restrictions strough are opposed bv a
newl\ non-apathetic student bod v.
We appreciate the administrative
efl< >1 ts .it envire itimental < < uiservation and
want t<> believe the\ are genuine. The
pui pose nuclei King the demands, signed
b\ over 200 students, is to open a dia
logue on the Foothills development issue
between the I niversit\ and its students.
li\ removing an\ opposition to our
hike. Stanford demonstrated both its com
mitment to the free expression of its stu
dents (thanks!) and its hope that without
dramatic confrontation the issue would
soon die. We tincl sii< ha hope insulting.
\\ e submit that the specter of 250 stu
dents shedding theii commitment to
apath\ will haunt Stanford more persis
tent!) than an\ confrontation. We sub
mit that last night's ac tions pave the way
for an open dialogue among students,
communit\ members and administra
tors regarding both the hours the
Foothills are available and the types of
use permitted (foot, bike, dog, cow,
horse, true k). We submit the demands of
the Foothill Liberation Front tothecom
nillliit\ at large with over 200 signatures.
Last night's events are emblematic of
the struggle fora student voice. We will
be heard.

Dish editorial receives detailed criticism
I am puzzled bv vour recent editorial
on the Foothills ("Dish modifications
unpleasant and unjustified, Sept. 27).
You appear to be surprised and
angered In things that vou endorsed last
Spring; further, vour editorial contains so
many errors of fact that I wonder if am ol
vour editorial staff have ac tuallv visited the
Foothills — or, for that matter, read the
letter from me that vou published Mav lf>.
I discussed the "trails'" issue, and the
histon of public access to the Foothills. I
helped build the KZSI transmittei site in
the foothills in 19f>9 and have been
involved in its maintenance since then, so
tn\ perspective is tli.it of someone who
has been a regulai user of the foothills foi
over 30 vears.
faking vour editorial point bv point:
"positive. aspects . . . undermined by the
paving <>/ the four-mile 100/);" "emu rete road;"
"imptu'(-related injuries."
Nearh all of this "loop" has been
paved since the late '40s. I he existing
(but badlv deteriorated) asphalt pave
ment was removed, and replaced with
new asphalt (not concrete) pavement.
I he only previoush unpaved areas
that are now paved are (1) the section
from the entrance of the Big Dish head
ing northwest to the new reservoir, a dis
tance of about half a mile, and (2) a foot
path from the Stanford Avenue pedestri
an gate up to the existing service road.
flie replacement of broken, pot holed
pavement, or, foi that matter, of mud
and roc ks, with smooth pavement is a
boon to all who walk there. As someone
who frequently walks there for recre
ation. Fin pleased that m\ risk of an
"impact injury" caused In tripping and
falling on my face is grcatlv reduced.
Stanford, as the landowner, could be
held liable for injuries sustained bv its
guests due to dangerous conditions. Nor
mally, when a landowner corrects a haz
ard. we say he is "being responsible."
"now inaccessible shortly after working
lionrs;" "access is severely restricted," "hours
should no longer he restricted."
The area has never been open to recre
ational use at night —a restriction that is
finally being enforced.
Except for the dog ban, the rules for
access have not been significantly
changed, but they are (at last) being

mini ( I'd.
Are you advocating unrestricted 24-
hour access? Do the safety issues related
to haying the public wandering around
an unlighted hillside .ill night bother vou?
"decision to use motorized vehicles"
I he roads are service roads, designed
and built for the specific purpose ol allow
ing access In motor vehicles to the various
radio sites, and have been used for that
purpose for over fift\ years.
Nothing much has ( hanged here.
"stationing oJ nrtned guards"
I he area is patrolled In the Stanford
Department ol Public Safet\. The Depart
ment employs both unarmed "(Communi
ty Service Officers" (who comprise most
of those patrolling the Foothills) and
Deputy Sheriffs (who, like all (California
peace officers, are armed).
These are the same folks who patrol
the rest of the campus, and their presence
there has not occasioned any anguished
editorials in The Daily. I heir presence is
necessary to enforce the rules that many
have long been ignoring, and is onerous
only to lawbreakers.
"trails should he opened
I he closing of the "bootleg" trails was
,m explicit part of the originally published

plan, for reasons discussed in that plan,
and amplified in my letter of Mav l<>. Win
did you like it in Max . but hate it now?
"should he opened ... to dogs"
1 think the ban on dogs is unfortunate,
but it was made necessary bv the continu
ing refusal of (log owners to leash their
dogs. In ntv experience, 90 percent of the
clogs accompanying hikers were
unleashed, in violation of Stanford's post
ed rules and the county's leash law. An
outright I).in is easier to enforce.
University "lias not been accountable"is
responsible for justifying it\ actions."
I he University has no more need to
justify how (or whether) it allows visitors
to use its back yard than any other prop
erty owner. Stanford I niversitv is not a
public park!
If you decide not to invite me to plav in
your back yard, do you have to "justify"
this decision? If you used to invite me
over, but stop doing so, can I sue vou? If
you have the biggest back yard in town,
does this give me the light to have my
bring my clog to play there?
You seem to be missing the key issue
here: Stanford's lands are a substantial
part of its endowment, and Stanford I ni
versitv exists to do education and

research. I here are many who seem to
want seize a large chunk of Stanford land,
without compensation, for use as a public
recreation area. Doesn't this attempted
ripoff of .1 huge chunk of your Universi
ty's endowment worry you?
