## 
### LAURA COLEMAN 
Beginning 111 spring 2000,
sophomore jeaiiette k a meII and
junior Anne Harden worked to
gether with Stanford alumnus Dr.
Michael McCullough to form
SCOI'K, a uni(|iie cinergenc \
loom volunteer program.
S( ()I'K, which stands lor Shad
owing lor Clinical Opportunity
.ind Preniedical Kxperience, has
already been lornialh approved at
1' I (.amino I lospitaland is ( urrent
l\ awaiting final approval <it Santa
Clara Valley Medical Center,
where the pilot program was
launched.
" I lie program is .t great experi
ence loi oihei students lo have.'
Kaniell said. "It lias definitely
< hanged the wa\ I see medicine; ii
has made me want to do ili.il lor
in\ living, lor ni\ lilc."
I his \cat. Kaniell and liai tleii
pi.in to expand the scope ol the
program In involving as mam as
!'>() premedical studenis. Anyone
over IS <an applv, and. if they're
accepted. ilie\ will intern in the

emergency room.
S( ()I'K interns will he assigned
io shadow specific emergency
room attending physicians ai one
ol the hospitals lor about two lull
shifts per month or as many as
one per week. A typical shift runs
from eight to 10 hours. During his
shift, a student will shadow the
physician in the l\R, observing
even clinical and inter-personal
situation tli.it the dot tor ma\ en
(ounter during her rounds.
flic experiences will vary
slightl\ between the two hospitals.
I he interns at Santa (llara will
have the possibility to watch trau
mas, such .is stab wounds or am
putations. At I.I Camino Hospital,
tlu- volunteers will act as scribes
and take down the patient's med
ical history while the KR physician
asks the patient questions and
gives the physical exam. Interns
will also have the oppoi(unity to
work as translators il they have
knowledge ol another language.
I think that taking the prenied
classes at Stanford may prepare
\ou lot medical school, but tlicy

don't give \on an idea of what
practicing will actually lie like,
and I think that this program
does. As the result of participat
ing in this program, I no longer
have am doubts; 1 want to go into
human medicine." Harden said.
Kamel! said she originally got
involved in die program In shad
owing Mc( ailloiigh and working
with him with throughout the
summer during many all-night
and day and weekend shifts. She
will be acting as director ol the
program and will help to train
the new interns.
"At [Santa ( lara| von see some
p ret I \ intense siulT, anvthing
Ironi tailing io hitting your head
when vou're drunk to aciualh
d\ing in a car accident," kamell
said,
" I he KR stall likes hav ing you
there because you make it more
ellic ient and patients think th.it
vou're a doctor because you're
wearing st rubs," she added.
Mc ( aillough, who was a pre
medic al student at Stanlord as an
under'graduate, remembers that

ii was hard i<> get into the KR
when he was here. Mis idea lor
S(.()l'K emerged .is .1 variation <>l
die program ollered ai San Fran
cisco (ieneral I lospiial, where lie
worked lor six weeks.
I le said his main motivation
behind die program was to find
out "how yon can get reallv bright

people with altruistic hearts into
the KR so that they can help peo
ple and learn something .is well.
"Almost everyone at both hos
pitals is supportive <>1 the pro
gram,' he added. "The cool thing
is that [the interns] will be able to
see a wide range of ways to inter
act with people. I lies learn to

treat all patients with an open
heart, the way you treat a 3-year
old versus a schizophrenic who's
trying to hit you, McCullough
said.
