### ALEX BENJAMIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Saying lhai the next two
games will be a challenge Ibr the
Stanford men's- soccerto.un
would be .in understatement.
I his weekend Stanford (8-0-
I) will face oil'at home against
possibly the two toughest teams
it will lace tins season. Tonight
at 7:! M) at New Maloney Field,
the Cardinal will plav Washing
ton ((i-!i), ranked No. 12 by Soc
cer America, and on Sunday the
team challenges I CIA ((S-0),
ranked No. I by both Soccer
America and the National Soc
cer Coaches Association of
America.
Considering that Washing
ton conies into tonight's game
with nine of last year's starting
twelve returning, the lower
tanked team could prove to be
the tougher opponent.
"I definitely think that the
Washington game will be the
hardest," said Stanford head

< oacli Hobby (-lark. "They are a
team very ninth like ourselves.
I hey are very hard working and
as a result don't give teams
many opportunites to score.
I hey .-didn't graduate nvanv
players and despite a few hic
cups at the beginning oil he year
they have been very consistent.
They are a tremendously strong
team."
Last year's champion of the
old Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation, the Huskies had a
rough start to this season, losing
its lii st two games against No. 16
Creighton and No. 11 South
west Missouri State. However,
Washington has since gotten
back on track by winning six of
its last seven games.
I wo important statistics
favor the Cardinal in tonight's
match-up. In Washington's
lirst nine games, they have only
out scored their opponents 13-

10. Stanford on the other hand,
has out scored its opponents .S,X-1.
Notable players for the Huskies
are returning seniors kai Cat roll,
fast season's leading goal scorer,
and Mike Casale, who started all
21 games last year. At the defensive
end. all but one of last year's
starters has returned, including ju
niors Bryn Ritchie and Billy
Sleeth, both of whom started 20
games as sophomores.
Stanford comes into Sunday's

match with the challenge of hand
ing UCLA its first loss of the sea
son. Much like the Cardinal, the
Bruins have started out in impres
sive fashion, out scoring opponents
23-4.
Still, UCLA is by no means un
touchable. ()l their eight wins, onh
one of them has been against a top
-2") opponent, a 2-1 win over No. ">
Indiana. In games against com
mon opponents, Stanford has fin
ished ahead.
I his does not mean Sunday's
game will be easy. Despite the loss
of five players to Major League
Soccer, including Sash a Vic
torine, 1000's NSCAA National

Player of the Year, UCLA has a
number of other players that
Stanford must contain. Returning
this year lot the Bruins are three
members of the 1097 NCAA Na
tional Championship team —
Mt Kinley lennyson jr., Shaun
l sakiris, and Ryan Leeas — as
well as Ryan Futagaki, a bron/e
medalist in the 1000 Pan Am
Games.
For Stanford, this weekend
will be incredibly tough, but the
team enters the weekend led In a
very strong crew. On offense,
the Cardinal will have seniors
Scott Leber (nine goals), Luke
Rust (six goals) and Core\ Wool

folk (four goals) along with
sophomore Johanes Mali/a (five
goals). In the middle of the field
seniors Ryan Nelseti and Matt
Moses and junior Derek Shana
han share the job of controlling
the game. At the back, Stanford
is led In senior goalkeeper Adam
Zapala with help from senior
Chris Gores, juniors Lee Morri
son and Aaron Biddle and
sophomore l odd Dunivant.
"UCLA at the moment is No. 1
and deservedly so, [Hut]l think
ih.it Washington is even better,"
( Hark said. "I lowever, I think that
we are capable of beating
them both."
