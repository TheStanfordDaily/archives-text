### ALEX BENJAMIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Saying lhai the next two
games will be a challenge Ibr the
Stanford men's- soccerto.un
would be .in understatement.
I his weekend Stanford (8-0-
I) will face oil'at home against
possibly the two toughest teams
it will lace tins season. Tonight
at 7:! M) at New Maloney Field,
the Cardinal will plav Washing
ton ((i-!i), ranked No. 12 by Soc
cer America, and on Sunday the
team challenges I CIA ((S-0),
ranked No. I by both Soccer
America and the National Soc
cer Coaches Association of
America.
Considering that Washing
ton conies into tonight's game
with nine of last year's starting
twelve returning, the lower
tanked team could prove to be
the tougher opponent.
"I definitely think that the
Washington game will be the
hardest," said Stanford head

< oacli Hobby (-lark. "They are a
team very ninth like ourselves.
I hey are very hard working and
as a result don't give teams
many opportunites to score.
I hey .-didn't graduate nvanv
players and despite a few hic
cups at the beginning oil he year
they have been very consistent.
They are a tremendously strong
team."
Last year's champion of the
old Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation, the Huskies had a
rough start to this season, losing
its lii st two games against No. 16
Creighton and No. 11 South
west Missouri State. However,
Washington has since gotten
back on track by winning six of
its last seven games.
I wo important statistics
favor the Cardinal in tonight's
match-up. In Washington's
lirst nine games, they have only
out scored their opponents 13-
