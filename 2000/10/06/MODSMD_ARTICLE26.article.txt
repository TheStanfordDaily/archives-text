### MATT LONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I he Stanford looihall team may
slip, hul it seldom tails.
The Cardinal lias rebounded
from its last six losses to defeat the
next week's opponent and has not
sullered consecutive losses since
ID9K. But this week the Cardinal
(2-2, 1-1 Pacific 10 Conference)
makes one of the toughest road
trips iu college football when ii
squares off against No. 25 Notre
Dame (2-2) in South Bend, Ind. at
1 1 \S() a.m. tomorrow.
Thus far, the Irish have played
one of the toughest schedules in
football. They lost to No. 1 Nebras
ka by three points in overtime and
have beaten Texas A&M and Pur
flue, both then top-25 teams.
I omorrow, Notre Dame finds
itself in a similar spot at the quar
terback position as Stanford, both
teams will start freshman. A frac
tured wrist has sidelined Notre
Dame's Arnaz Battle and head
coach bob Davie decided Wednes
day that he will start freshman Matt
LoVen bio, a prized high s< liool re
cruit who has shown promise in
practice but only thrown one pass
in his career.

"I le's smart and lie's on it. And
the players know lie's on it," Davie
said. "He has those intangible
things that put him ahead <>l those
other freshmen right now."
Stanford head coach Tyrone
Willingham hopes his freslnnan
quarterback, redshirt Chris Lewis,
also has something special to un
leash tomorrow. Alter taking over
lor injured redshirt junior Randy
Fasani and leading the Cardinal to
victory against then-No. Texas,
Ix'wis struggled against the Arizona
pass rush last Saturday and threw
two interceptions in a 27-.'i loss.
I think Chris did some good
things [against Arizona]," said Will
ingham. "But I think there was also
some learning that took place dur
ing that football game."
Playing in the cold and expected
rain at sold-out Notre Dame Stadi

the quarterback, especialh in onlv
his second collegiate start.
"As a quarterback, von must
take what tlicv give you," said Will
ingham. "You don't trv to force the
action. You take advantage of it. Ki

or a veteran quarterback, if they do
