# Volleyball looks for defense to halt losing skid
## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN 
doming oil a pair of rough weeks,
the Stanford women's volleyball team
has a lot to look forward to this week
end. Returning home to play two un
ranked opponents in front of what are
expected to he some of the largest
crowds of the season sets up a scenario
as advantageous as this team can imag
ine right now.
fhe No. 21 Cardinal (7-(i, 2-4 Pacific
10 (onference) will tr\ to snap the pro
gram's first ever four-game losing
streak as it takes on l'ac-10 opponents
Washington Stale (10-4, 1-4) tonight
,ind Washington (4-K, 0-5) tomorrow,
with both games starting at 7 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion.
Despite its current 0-2 home record,
with losses to No. I I S( 1 and No. 8
UCLA two weeks ago, the team is look
ing forward to playing in Maples again.
With tonight's "Dorm Night" promo
tion, the team is hoping to draw its
largest crowd of the season so far to
watc li them take on the ('.ougars.
"I think everyone generally plays

better with big crowds," said senior mid
dle blocker Jennifer Detmer, who leads
the team with .i .422 attack percentage.
"It's fun when you have lots of people
supporting you."
Interim head coach Denise Corlett
agreed.
"We like that atmosphere. It gives
you <i little more life on the court," she
said. "I think it'll help a lot if we get a
good crowd out there and get them be
hind us. If we can get the freshmen out
there and the students to support their
team, it'll be a fun night."
I he team has struggled to find some
consistency this season. Sophomore All-
American Logan Tom has been playing
for the U.S. women's volleyball team at
the Olympics in Sydney and is only
scheduled to return to school today.
Without Tom, who has yet to decide
when she will return to the Cardinal
lineup, the Stanford squad has not had
i lie- luxury of a single go-to player to rely
on offensively.
In the meantime, the team has strug
gled to conic up with a group of six on
the court that can consistently put

pointson the board. (lorlctt believes her
team is nearing that point, however.
"Practices this week have been very
good," she said. "We continue to work
very hard and we're looking very good
in the drills. We just need to learn to
take it onto the- court with its."
fhe team spent much of this week
working on forcing sideouts, combating
defensive problems that plagued the
Cardinal last weekend in losses to No. 7
Arizona and Arizona State.
Stanford has also worked on contin
uing to develop players into more con
sistent roles for the team. Junior I ara
Conrad is expected to start at outside
hitter tonight, after she was moved
there from her usual position at middle
blocker last weekend. Conrad posted I.H
kills and 10 digs against Arizona State
last weekend at outside hitter.
Neither of Stanford's opponents for
the weekend pose too much of a threat
on paper, but the (lardinal is still taking
both games very seriously. Washington
and Washington State faced each other
last weekend, with Washington Slate
easily sweeping its in-state rivals.

I he C lougarsare led by outside hitter
IxiToya Harris. 1 lie sophomore has
posted !M)5 kills per game and came up
with 21 kills in Washington State's
match last weekend. Middle hitter
I lolh I lan is has also played well lor the
team, averaging 2.88 kills and 1.05
blocks per game.
Washington tomes to the Farm bas
ing not won a game in theii live confer
ence matches this season. I he I luskics
did not beat the Cardinal once in the
'90s. last winning a man h played at
Stanford in 1989. They have only two
players averaging over three kills per
game, Lisa Underbill (.V29 kpg) and
Emily Seacat (3..'58 kpg).
I lie Washington match will be the
first time Stanford defensive specialist
Fmily Lawrence gets a chance to play
against her little sister Libby
Lawrence at the collegiate level. Libb\
has earned a starting role during her
freshman year at defensive spec ialist
for the I luskics.
"There's no way I can lose to baby
sis," Fmily joked. "I'm just really proud
that she's there and starting."
