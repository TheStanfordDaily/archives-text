(.Murder s newest, "1 rapped
in Crime," is a pcrlect example ol
popular rap gone wrong, liven
though his name is virtually absent
from the credits, all ol the album's
problems st ream ol Master I's
dirty influence: unoriginality is
rampant.
Nothing is new about this album:
not the licks, not the stupid hooks
sung In R&li women, not the pos
turing. not the commercialism, not
even the beats. All of it is stolen Irtun
those that came before — those that
thought lor themselves.
I here is one caveat. Rap, from
the beginning, has reused old ma

terial. The first popular rap song,
"Rapper's Delight," In Sugar Mill
Gang, was created from samples
from "Good limes. Sampling is
pervasive to the point that most rap
songs are rehashes of older Mo
town, R&B or jazz beats.

Mut it's one thing to make "Fire
it Up" from the Knight Rider
theme like Busta Rhymes did. It's
something completely dillerent to
rip |imi Hendrix's national an
them, the Notorious 8.1.G and

Snoop Dogg. And only a No Limit
soldier would think to do all ol this
in one song, as (,-Murder did with
"Forever Tru." |ust listen to that
guitar 1 ill and think "Nothingbut a
G' I hang." And the world really
doesn't need another song titled

"Concrete Jungle"— Bob Marley
did it just line.
If the beats were serviceable, the
stealing would be a smaller issue.
But ('.-Murder did the production,
and did so incompetently. You

probably won't be hearing "They
Don't Really Know You" anywhere
soon. That's because the primary
sound in the song is an alarm clock
beep. Sorry, ('.-Murder, but people
don't want to hear that sound any
more than they have to.
None ol""Trapped in (Iritne" is
sonically interesting. The beats
are standard rap beats lacking in

any interesting form of syncopa
tion, and the sounds C-Murder
mixed in are overused, thin and
overly electronic. The harp in
" Too Much Noise" is interesting,
but, really, that's not enough. The
next song touts a steel drum,
which Da Brat already took ad
vantage of this summer.

Lyrically, the unoriginality con
tinues. C-Murcler likes to rhyme
simple words — like "up" and
"me" and"day" — to keep from
having to stretch his vocabulary
into interesting territory. Then an
interlude includes an R&B singer
serenading the audience with "1
want to bust in your eyes."
l"he emotional, sexual gangster

thing has been tlone too
many limes to grab my at
tention without some new
twists.
You can often tell how
bad a rap album is by the
number of collaborating
artists that crowd the
cover. No Limit albums
often read as compila
tions, and "Trapped in
Crime" is no different.
Snoop, Fat Joe, |.l). and
I).i Brat are among the 20
musicians that share the
microphone with C-Mur
der.
Sounds like someone was
nervous that C couldn't
bold his own. Sounds like
(--Murder wouldn't have
even gotten a first album
without being Master I's
actual brother.
Unfortunately, this
album will be peddled to

the point that it will probably
make a tidy sum of money for
Percy Miller, aka Master I'. Miller
has some genius in him, hut no
creativity. I lis genius is in his abil
ity to make a brand name so
strong that people will pitk up
" Trapped in Crime" even though
it really is a terrible album.
