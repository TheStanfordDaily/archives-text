< ertainly the hest skateboarding game ever < re
ated for any home video game system. So it's

not surprising that '"I oil) I lawk s Pro Skater 2"
lias been one ol tlie most anticipated games lor
the PlayStation (lining the few remaining
weeks before the system's next-generation

counterpart hits the market. And, while
gainers across the country ma\ be dying for the
stateside release of Play Station 2. they would do
well to pic k np the I ony I lawk sequel as soon
as possible. It is as close to perfect as a sequel
can get, and yon don't have to know what an
ollie is to know that this is an incredible game.
Activision and Neversolt have again teamed
np to refine the skating experience from the
original game into something equally Inn, ex
cept with added options. Hie basic ins and outs
remain the same: pick a pro skater, skate
through ramp and street levels, pull oil tad
tricks and then kick your best friend's ass in the
multiplayer mode. The controls are intuitive
(the same as in the original), and you c an ap
preciate the time and effort put into designing
this game engine without knowing anything
about skating. Dave Stohl, executive prodncei
at Activision Studios, claims that "Tony I lawk s
Pro Skater 2" "not only expands on all the

ground-breaking features of tin
original, but clearly sets a new
benchmark for the action-sports
genre." You may be thinking to
yourself that this is just a promo
tional representative spouting off
advertising talk, but, in this case, it
happens to be true.
The number of new features in
the game is not only surprising, but
also impressive in that they are all
improvements over the game's
predecessor. There are three new
pro skaters to choose from in a list
that includes everyone from the
lii st Tony Hawk, but the real kick
er is an option for total character
customization, a feature that allows
players to build a skater from
seratcli, including clothing and
trick sets. Additionally, an en
hanced career mode lets you earn
.md save money to buy new t rit ks
for your skaters, tipping the
game's replay value and adding
depth to the completion of each

level.
The levels themselves are all
real-world courses, ranging from
SoC '.al to France. They are chock
full of secret areas, shortcuts and
interactive objects, meaning that
you can trick off of almost every
thing on the screen. This may not
sound terribly daunting, but trving
to unlock 100 percent of the later
levels is going to be fairly challeng
ing. You may get that 50,000 "pro
score" on your first try, but it might
take a while before you can bust
out the "sick score" of 200,000.
One of the best new options is
an innovative skatepark editor,
where players can explore their
creative side and use a real-time 3-
1) editor to create any park imagin
able from over a hundred different
parts, ft may take a while to con
struct your dream park, but the
payoff is well worth the effort.
The soundtrack to the game
features a solid group of punk,
hardcore and hip hop performers,
including Bad Religion and Rage
Against the Machine. Although
these are all bands you might hear
on a skater video, the songs can gel

repetitive after a few rounds, a
slightly annoying aspect of the
game which has carried over from
the original.
This is one of the f ew drawbacks
to the game and, admittedly, there
are a lew more. For example, you
may find yourself playing for
hours on cud, only to emerge from
your room into the outside world
and become enormously de
pressed at the fact that you are not
Tony Hawk and therefore cannot
buy a deck and proceed to grind
your dorm stair rail into a 360
christ air and get across-the-gap
multiplier points for clearing the
bike racks. But, apart from this re
alization," I on) 1 lawk s Pro Skater
2" is an incredible game that will
make a skater out of us all. It even
has a demo of the forthcoming
"Matt Hoffman's I'ro KMX."
which is basicalh I'ony Hawk with
BMX bikes. So, with that said, go
out and buy / rent / borrow / steal
this masterpiece of skating heaven.
Developers have come a long way
since "Skate or Die," and gamers
every where can rejoice again in the
skate god that is Tony I lawk.
