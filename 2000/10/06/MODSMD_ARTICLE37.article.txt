# In your Face
## Intermission talks to face to face about Napster, record labels and Keanu Reeves Major labels suck. 
### JEB ORY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"You mind walking to a tattoo
parlor?" Trevor Keith, the lead
singer ot Face 10 Face, asks me
after introducing himself.
I don't.
Keith, at least in appearance, is
the archetypal punk rocker, lie
stands about 5'K", body coated in
tattoos, with one fading black bat
<1 strangely out ol place tempo
rary tattoo — stamped to his
neck. Purple hair, old faded jeans
and a generic T-shirt complete
the composite of the aging punk
rocker.
Keith introduces me to Scott
Shilflet, the bassist. At 34, Scott
has had plenty of time to rock out
and his comments belie the wis
dom ol one who has toured hun
dreds of cities for over a decade.
The last person I meet, Pete Para
da, is both the drummer and the
baby of the group. Moreover, as
the one unmarried member of
the Southern California punk
rock band, it is Pete's responsibil
ity to entertain any groupies the
band encounters.
"We usually don't have
groupies. Our music tends to at
tract a rougher, uglier crowd.
Hut, if we do get any, we send 'em
Pete's way," Schifllet says.
A little background of Face to
Face is in order.
Face to Face is a pure, upbeat,
punk rock band out of Southern
California. Formed in 1991, the
band has a decade of experience
.md live full-length albums to its
credit. On their latest compact
disc, "Reactionary," they have es
tablished a new precedent lor the
recording industry by allowing
their fans to select their favorite
12 tracks (out of I(») through on
line voting.
"To my knowledge, we may be

the first to do something like that.
Our last record was really differ
ent and it upset some of our fans,"
Keith says. "So I had the idea to
make M P!Vs available online to he
voted on by our fans."
Face to Face received more
than 2 million votes for its songs
online. Keith, surprised by the
overwhelming response from the
band's online fans, has conceded
that not all of the 2 million votes
were legitimate.
"1 know that some kids proba
bly set up computer programs
and voted for their favorite songs
overnight. But 2 million votes is
an amazing response," Keith says.
Napster
As demonstrated by their at
tempts to involve fans in the song
selection process online, Face to
Face has worked hard to establish
itself as a prominent player in the
digital-music age. My supporting
Napster and encouraging tapings
and bootlegs from its shows, they
have clearly spoken out in favor
of fan-based music sharing. Fhe 2
million-plus votes for "Reac
tionary" indicate that the band's
music has enough widespread ap
peal to thrive online.
"Based on the number of e
mails we get from fans saying they
first discovered our band on Nap
ster, there isn't any doubt in my
mind that Napster has driven
more people into the record
stores than it's kept away," said
Rich Egan, co-owner of Vagrant
Records and manager of Face to
Face.
Keith believes that file-sharing,
whether on Napster or on other
such programs, is the future of
music.
"File sharing will always be
there. II it's not on Napster, then
it will be somewhere else. We
might as well embrace it," Keith

says. "Our tour is sponsered by
Napster. It's a good thing and
Face to Face is glad to be a part of
it. It's not hurting our record
sales one bit."
As if to emphasize this point.
Keith often leads the crowds at bis
live shows in chants of "Napster is
good! Lars (Ulrich of Metallica
and anti-Napster critic) is bad!"
"The Watcher"
During the first few blocks ol
our walk, Scott ShifHet is virtually
silent. I le breaks the quiet with a
wise crack about how he went to
|ulliai'd. lie explains that his
main role in the band is to pro
vide levity during an otherwise
grueling tour.
Shilflet lias never been any
where neat |ulliard.
Our conversation turns to the
film, " I'lie Watcher," and Shifllel
suddenly begins to talk.
I Ie decries both Keanu Reeves'
acting ability and the genre ol

films that degrade women. Shil
llet contradicts the ultra-radical
punk rocker image by by express
ing <m unexpected sensitivity.
"We don't want to convey a
derogatory or violent message [to
women]. Our songs are deeper
than some <>l the standard punk
rock. I think violence sucks," Shif
llet says.
Face to Face, Shiflift explains,
has been together for so long be
cause they love playing music. Its
lyrics contain no hate or venom.
The peace-and-love message
Shilllet shares li.is a very upbeat
feel, which is somewhat odd in the
context of punk rock — but no
more odd than the band's pro
gressive and cohesive style.
"I'm older than most people
|ill the scene]. I've learned that
our musical lile is about being
smart, and not being stupid,"
Sliillift says.
Shilllet lias the same outlook
regarding drug and alcohol use.
He condones such use as long as it
doesn't lead to violence.
"In fact, I fucking get violent
over violence," Shilllet says, in his
tongue-in-cheek delivery. Al
though he is 34 and speaks re
peatedly about his .ige, Shilllet
seems the happiest and most
youthful of the group.
" I am having a better time now
than when I was 11 or 24," Shil
llet says."I love being on tour.
And when the tour is over, I gel to
spend time vviili my wife. What
could be better?"

Labels
Keith .iikl Shilllel also shared
their views on I he debate over big la
bels versus indepeiidenl ones.
"Major labels suck," Shilllel says.
Keith has a more comprehensive
approach. To him, there isn't very
much difference between a big label
and au indie one. both .tie iu the
music business to make money and
both, he hypothesizes, do not initial
ly intend to screw over artists.
"A lot ol people make a big deal
about rallying around the under
dog. I know some indie labels that
are just as ruthless as the major la
bels," Keith says.
I le characterizes the larger labels
as having more inept employees, a
result of huge stalls that are fre
quently out of synch with the differ
ent components oft heir firm.
"Nobody ever started a label to
luck bands," Shilllel says.
Keith, the leader and idea man
of Face to l ace, is the co-owner of
Lady Luck Records, which pro
duced "Reactionary." Lady Luck is
a spinoff from Vagrant Records, a
larger, San Diego-based label. Keith
has had to deal with both owning .1
smaller label and having dose allili
ation with the larger Vagrant label.
I*ace to Face is wrapping up its
tour, which has already passed
through San Francisco, but you can
still check them out 011 the Napster
Web site, which features digital
downloads ol their live shows,
Ml'.Ts of live songs, and other real
time tour updates.
