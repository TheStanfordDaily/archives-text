# Dog show mockumentary 'Best in Show' wins with ensemble cast, solid dialogue

### STEPHANIE WAGNER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Movies with ensemble casts
seem virtually predestined to dis
appoint. But, then again, this
may only be the case with Woody
Allen flicks. Indeed, Christopher
Guest's latest, "Best in Show,"
showcases not only a large cast of
wonderfully talented stars but

also some great dialogue.
Director, co-star and co-writer
Guest (well known as the infa
mous six-fingered Count Rugen
in "The Princess Bride") follows
up his 1!)97 elTort, "Waiting Foi
Guflman," with ,i similarly Idr
matted mockumentai v. This time

he focuses on the various dog
owners and handlers who enter
their pups in a big-time dog show.
Starring most of the same actors
from "Cullman," "Best in Show"
rearranges them in different
roles, using their improvisa-

tional abilities to take a
loosely organized idea and
create quirky, hilarious
characters.

Dog Show is the spectacu
larly tense event to which
most of the plot leads. But,
even at the dog show, the
actors are the ones who steal
the stage. Catherine
O'Hara and co-writer Eu-

gene Levy, who both had starring
roles in "Cullman," play Cookie
and (Jerry Fleck. 1 le's as dorky as
he's ever been, literally sporting
two left feet, while she's a terrific
former slut who's finally settled
down with a nice guy and can't
seem to stop running into former
lovers. Both provide countless
laughs, particularly during the

songs they perform about dogs,
with an inspirational one specifi
cally hailing the terrier.
Then there are Meg and
Hamilton Swan, an ultra-yuppie
couple played by indie-movie-

queen Parker Posey and Michael
I litchcock. As the two relate to the
camera the joys of Hipping
through page after page ol J.
Clrew and L.L. Bean catalogs,
there's a certain light in their eyes
that tells you you're dealing with
real nut cases.
Speaking ol nuts, (iuest plays
perhaps the most understated

role in the film, a stark contrast to
his flamboyant Corky St. Clair in
"Cullman". As a simple fly fisher
man and bloodhound owner, he
delights with his knack for ven
triloquism and listing off all types
of nuts. Who

ple of Stefan Van-

(Michael McKean and John

Stefan and the fashionably loud
Scott don't exhibit the neuroses ol
the other characters hut bring a
refreshing sense of blissful dedi
cation both to one another and
their dog.
Veteran actor Fred Willard

makes an appearance as a lovably
ignorant commentator at the dog
show with a penchant for spout
ing all sorts of sports analogies
and sexual innuendo that some
how relate to the goings-on. With
one-liner after one-liner, he tran
scends the odds and makes it fun
to watch what actually is, for all
intents and purposes, a dog
show.
Perhaps one of the reasons
why this ensemble cast works so
well is because the actors not only
have chemistry from previous col
laboration, but because they had
creative control over their lines.
This personalizing and improvi
sational aspect presents us with
actors at their most inventive and
entertaining.
The script is undeniably litfht
but completely enjoyable. No
Oscar performances here, but
solid comedy makes it a fun film.
Somewhat more focused and
mainstream than its predecessor,
"Waiting for Guffman," Guest's
latest is delightful and extremely
accessible.
