"PoliticalK Incorrect with I>lll

Mahet " is one ol'television's mosi
provocative shows, featuring a
quartet ol diverse personalities
nightly who, along with Mailer,
discuss the day's burning social
and political issues. Because ol the
diversity of the guests, who come
from the worlds of politics, enter
tainment, media and literature,
the debate sometimes gets healed
and often turns intelligently
funny.
"I was so excited when I heard
that 'Politically Incorrect' was com
ing to campus," said sophomore
Carolyn Sangokoya. "It's a cool
show because it's like the evening
news with a twist."
Tonight's participants will re
main a secret inilil show time,
however, the concert nelwoi k's di
rector VVcs Rade/ hinted at the

identities of the four guests. Ac
cording to Radez, the panel will
include an ABG personality, a
local politic ian, a person of Stan
ford interest and a member of the
national press.
This evening's show is one
stop on Mailer's tour across
American colleges in the middle
ol the 2000 presidential race.
"The Stanford students are
going to get an evening oi com
mentary politic s with a humorous
edge.'' Rade/ said.
( ailed " I lie Best I .ilk She>w
on Television" by FV Guide, "Po
litically Incorrect" has won lour
Gable Ace Awards lor Best Enter
tainment Host and Best Talk
Show. It has also been nominated
lor nine Kmmv Awards. Some of

the program's past guests include
Ben Affleck, Ice Cube, Pamela
Anderson Lee, Oliver Sione,
Norman Mailer and Ralph
Nader.
Rade/ said that "ibis event is
unique because it's a good part
nership between the SGN and
Speakers Bureau. 'Politic alb In
correct' is really not a concert or
lecture, so by the two organiza
tions working together, everyone
gets a great a show."
"Politically Incorrect" is one ol
