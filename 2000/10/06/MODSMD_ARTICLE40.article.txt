that those on the screen are just ac -
tors, even a familiar face such as
Academy Award-winner Den/el
Washington.
The story takes place in 1971
when Alexandria, Virginia is
forced to integrate two segregat
ed high schools into one — T.C.
Williams. High school football is a
serious subject here, so it only
makes matters worse when the
white school's winning (loach

\<>ast (Will Pattern, "Armaged
don") is replaced by .1 black out
sider, (loach Boone (Washing
ton). Yoast keeps his cool and
stays on .is assistant; though lie is
not vcr\ happy about the situa
tion, lie is more open with his feel
ings than most ol the town.
()l course, there is much initial
Iridion and even ,1 brick thrown
through a window. I hen the
team goes off to training camp
and learns to work hard and get
along through a little tough love
and forced fraternity. Sound
generic? It's not.
I lie movie explores multiple
aspects of the situation and, just
when it looks like everyone's get
ting along, they all have to exit
their bubble and return to
Alexandria, where struggles in
volving race, football and life in
general await them.
The trajectory of the film will be
familiar from many similar sports
films. But this film does it right,
leading us to care about the char
acters and rooting for the team —
and individuals — involved.
The cool Yoast is complement
ed by his football-obsessed

daughter, Cheryl (Hayden Panet
tiere), who serves her role as the
die-hard fan / honorary coach ad
mirably. The players, too, do a
noteworthy job, with Gerry (Ryan
Hurst, "Saving Private Ryan")
and Petey (Donald Adeosun Fai
son, "Clueless") as the de facto
captains of the white and black

sides before they merge into one
powerful force.
Pop songs of the era figure into
the movie heavily as is typical of
such period pieces. In this case,
the selections are appropriate for
both fun and drama. And the
football lingo and action se
quences are enough to enliven a

fan without boring a neophyte.
Such aspects of the film may
sound typical, but they fit togeth
er perfectly here. "Remember the
Titans" is a sale bet fora night out
— a well-done, thoughtful and
emotional ride through the world
of high school football during in
tegration.
