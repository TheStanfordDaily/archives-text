t lioose Irom this (all.
I lie reconfigured Science, Math and Kngincering
('.ore now oilers ,i sophomore seminar and two mulii
quarter programs.
When the I niversity started the SMK program in
199(i, it aimed to give students studying the humani
ties an opportunity to study the sciences with an in
terdisciplinary approach, incorporating the funda
mentals ol math, science and engineering in three
three-quarter sequences: Light, Heart and Karth.

I ..isi year, following low enrollment problems, two
of the three tracks, I lean and Kartli, were (aneelled.
1 lie new (lasses oHered in the program this year
cover fresh material.
The first is a three-quarter track called "Science
,ind Societv m<i Rapidh (.hanging World. Ii consists
ol "Kartli, ()ceans and Atmospheres' available in the
lall, "Food and Water in a ('.hanging World ollered
in the winter and "Fvolution, Kcology and the
I lum,in (Condition taught in the spring. I aking all
three courses is not re(|uired. All three (lasses deal
with nature, humanity, ecology and the environment.
I lie second program, a spin-oil Ol the original
Light course, is a two-quarter track (ailed "Inlorma
lion: Hits to (.liips, (leties to ()rganisms. I Ins < ourse
explores information— how ii is perceived and

According to Klectrical Fngineering hoi. Brad
()sgood. I,K ultv advisor for the SMK program, main
students dislike s( ietice because ol their unfavorable
experiences in high school, which
might have been due lo a bad
teacher.
I his was the case with Kenny
Garrett, a junior majoring Inter
national Relations, lie said that
prior to taking the Light track, he
didn't think that lie was good at
the sc ienc es because of his experi
ence in high school, lint after tak
ing Light:, he thought about ma
joring in physics.
"The best part that made it
what it was was the attention from
such larulty," Garrett said. "They
are brilliant — having that kind ol
attention, and knowing that they
are investing so much. They didn't
have to be doing this."
Garrett also points out that the
professors were alwavs willimr to

help and answer questions.
junioi Annie Abr,tins origin.ill\
took the Light track just to lullill
her general education require
ments, but said slit- ended up lov
ing the course.
"One day vou are dissecting a
cow's eye, and another day you are
dissecting a television set, she
said. "Then vou are on a field n ip
to the Exploratorium, ot taking .1
picture of Hoover lower with
your own hand-cralted pinhole
camera. We even had a lecture
about the at list's view of perspec
tive and cole>r. And if \ou are luckv
enough, Professor Brad ()sgood
might explain a 'mvsten ol the
universe." "
SM K students are also given the
opportunil\ to participate in labs
and stuch with «i more hands-on
approach. ()sgood poinis out ili.il
