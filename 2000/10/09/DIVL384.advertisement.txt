Authorities apprehended a Gal student poorly disguised as a
member of the incomparable Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band.The criminal was trying to obtain the exceptional car

"The guy was much too stiff. We played a bit of a Sousa march
and, sure enough, he stood up straight and started marching, knees
high. We had the scoundrel in custody almost immediately," said a
security officer.
"I can't justify what he did,but I do understand,"
says John Babel, AVP of landing for
SFCU."We've told members they

can reduce the payment by rcfi- *• 8F JPI? %
nancing, we'll pay them $25 for \
giving us the business.* It's no X*
