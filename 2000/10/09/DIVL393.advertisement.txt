Alcohol can cause devastating
harm if misused. It can be
academic, social, legal, or health
related. The more you drink, the
greater your risks. And unfortu
nately, one single incident can lead
to irreparable damage. This sheet
is about how you can help prevent
that harm from occurring to you,
and to those you care about.
Why Do You Drink?
Three out of four Stanford
students drink lightly, or not at
all. This often involves a con
scious choice, but a lot of drinking
also results from unconscious
motivations. Becoming aware of
why you drink helps you to make
better decisions, and reduces your
risk of harm. EX) you drink to:
■ Get a break from your daily
routine?
■ Destress from school work?
■ Reward yourself?
■ Feel less inhibited in social
situations?
■ Because it is available?
■ Fit in with others while they
are drinking?
■ Express feelings that are
difficult to express when
you're sober?
■ Suppress painful feelings such
as shame, anger, sadness, or
loneliness?
When you use alcohol to repress
or deal with life's challenges, you
miss an opportunity to grow and
to develop effective coping skills.
Proactive measures like buddy
systems and designated drivers
were still decades aivay when
these Stanford students were on
campus.
Following are some alcohol
alternatives to try:
■ Talking with close friends
and family
■ Stress reduction techniques
■ Your favorite smoothie
■ Natural highs (we have a list
of over 200)
■ Professional help (when
necessary)
To Prevent Harm
Here are "alcohol first aid tips"
to help you prevent harm from
too much drinking:
■ Always appoint a designated
driver who will not drink
■ Don't over drink; set limits
beforehand
■ Set up a buddy system, and
stay together (don't abandon
intoxicated friends or let them
wander away; make sure they
get home safely)
■ Don't let someone drive-or
even ride their bike home if
they have had too much to
drink.
■ Call 9-911 for help if an
intoxicated person can't be
awakened or is unresponsive
(it's more important to save a
life than worry about the cost,
hassle and embarrassment of
an Emergency Room visit)
Concerned?
Are you worried that a friend's
(or your own) alcohol
consumption is a problem? Has
drinking become automatic or
excessive ? Is there trouble with
academics, friends, accidents or
injuries, or the University or
police? Some students with
alcohol problems can regain
control by consciously and
deliberately planning ahead to
avoid alcohol-related conse
quences, but a few need profes
sional help. To better understand
the seriousness of a friend's (or
your own) drinking pattern, see
our web site quick check list
under "Resources," below.
A Divisive Issue
Surveys show that drinking often
has an unwanted impact on other
students (e.g., noise, mess, disrup
tion, group reputation). But few
of those students speak up.
Educate yourself and each other,
and discuss these issues openly.
An alcohol educator can help a
community deal with them
constructively. Call 723-3429.
