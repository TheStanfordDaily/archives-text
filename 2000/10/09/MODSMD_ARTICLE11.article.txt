1957
On On. 9, 11)57, The Daily ran an arti
cle called "Pin-up Ciii Is, Dale Galleries
Were Froshbook Beginnings.
"Froshbooks originated at Stanford in the
middle of the '40s as a money-making pro
ject . Several Irosh men look pictures of their
female friends and hung these pictures in
their rooms. A l()-ccnt admission charge was
required of less enterprising classmates who
wished to see the 'campus lovelies.'
"The owners of this date gallery soon
found that they were losing friends
through their project. I pperclassmen
were upset because of the advantage Irosh
men had with Irosh girls, (iirls were com
plaining that they, too, should be able to
view their blind dates ahead of time.
"| ust as the money-makers were about
to tear up their pictures, one of them de
cided to go into the Quad office and offer
them the idea. Since fiosh pictures had to
be taken for the Quad anyway, the year
book staff decided to publish a book of all
these snaps â€” and thus the Froshbook
came into being."
Ten cents to check out your Screw Your Room
mate date? Hardly an unfair price to pay.
