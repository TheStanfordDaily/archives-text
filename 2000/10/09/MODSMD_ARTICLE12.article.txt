A strike at a major hospital here
has become the latest distress call
from the nation s nurses, whose
ranks have been stretched thin in the
era of managed health care.
In the nearly three-week-old walk
out, nurses at the 900-bed Washington
Hospital Center are decrying working
conditions, especially mandatory over
time, which they say threaten patient
safety and make it difficult to care for
their own Ja milies.
... Objections to mandatory over
time have helped spark recent strikes in
Worcester, Mass.; at Stanford Univer
sity's two hospitals in California; and
in Nyack, N.Y. All of the disputes were
settled with agreements limiting hospi
tals' power to insist on extra hours.
Concents about overtime also are be
ginning to surface in nonunion states,
as hospitals in many parts of the coun
try operate with 15 percent or higher
vacancies in their nursing staffs.
