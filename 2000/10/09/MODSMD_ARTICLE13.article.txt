JERUSALEM (AP) â€” Yesterday, Israelis marked
Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year, in an
atmosphere ol anxiety thai many compared to the
Day of Atonement 27 years ago when an Israeli-Arab
war erupted.
Rabbis announced special dispensations from the
strict lasting-and-praver observances. Combat soldiers
were permitted to break the last, and observant Jews
were told they to keep the radio on so they could keep
up-to-date in an emergency.
1 he deaths of 83 people, most Palestinians, in I 1
days ol rock-throwing rims and gun battles in the
West Bank and Cia/.a Strip shattered hopes nursed In
many Israelis that their long conflict with the Aral)
world was coming to an end.
Many said the violence, as well as the kidnapping
of three Israeli soldiers by Lebanese guerrillas, evoked
the trauma of October 1973, when Egypt and Svria
took advantage ol the Day ol Atonement and
launched a surprise attack on unprepared and under

manned Israeli forces occupying the Sinai Peninsula
and (>olan I (eights.
"We have not freed ourselves ol the heavy shadow
ol that day, 27 years ago, when the sirens sounded
and nearh 3,000 of our sons died," said Israel's ('.hief
Rabbi Israel Meir I JAU.
Yom Kippur began .it sundown Yesterday and lasts
until sunset today. Jews traditionally last during this
period as part of the atonement. In Israel, where a
majority ol the Jewish population partake of the hol\
clay rituals, buses and trains come to a halt just before
sundown and shops and businesses c losed down.
I lying to calm a nervous population. Prime Minis
ter Ehud liarak promised that Israel would overcome
its present difficulties. Barak, a retired and much-dec
orated general, said Israel had survived much worse
crises in the past.
"We had another Yom Kippur 27 years ago, when
everything looked really desperate, but we emerged
victorious," he said.
