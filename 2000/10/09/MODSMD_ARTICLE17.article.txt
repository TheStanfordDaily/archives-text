# Scientists close to first successful cloning of extinct animal

BOSTON (AP) —Meet Bessie, who
could soon be the first cow to <.• birth lo
a doned ox.
II she delivers the rare Asian gain
flowing inside her, she will herald a stun
ning new way to save endangered, or
even recently extinct, animals.
The bovine surrogate mother is tarry
ing the gam Ictus on a latin near Sioux
City, lowa, and is expected to give birth
to "Noah" next month.
"He will be the first endangered ani
mal we send up the ramp ol the ark,"
said Robert l.anza, the vice president ol
medical and scientific development at
Advanced Cell I ethnology, and one ol

the lead authors ola study published yes
terday in the journal Cloning. "This is no
longer science fiction. It's very, very
i eal."
St it-iitists had previously shown it is
possible lor one species to give birth to
implanted cmbrvos taken from a similar
species. But this is the first time they
have combined that technique with
cloning.
Ising a technique developed by AC I
in Worcester, si icntists removed the DNA
from one of Bessie's eggs and fused the
egg with a skin cell taken from a living
gaur, producing .1 genetically gam egg
that would be accepted by Bessie's

immune system.
Noah doesn't have a father. Before
being implanted in Bessie's uterus, the
egg was artificially induced to begin divid
ing without being fertilized.
I he technique could not be used on
long-extinct species because the DNA
donor cells must come from a live animal,
one th.it has been dead lor less than five
days, or one tli.it lias been frozen since its
death.
The goal of the research is to use the
cross-species cell transfer technology to
reprogram human cells lor medical pur
poses, said Michael West, chief executive
ollicer of A( IT.

I mil then, if Noah's birth is success
ful, developers say the technique could
be- used to rcpopulate rare animal
species.
I he Spanish government li.is given
AC I approval to clone the bucardo, a
newly extinct Spanish mountain goat,
flic last bucardo died earlier this vear
and was immediately frozen.
Researc hers are also considering rare
animals such .is the Afric an bongo, the
ocelot and the ijiatit panda lot the i lolling
project.
"We're not trying to build .1 big Noah's
Ark and save even animal, but we want
to point the wa\ lor how this t.ui be

done," he s,ml. "Saving the world is a tall
order, but we're Irving."
However, animal preservationists fear
the public will prefer the less-costlv
c loning techniques and pull funding for
expensive breeding and habitat protec
tion programs already 111 place.
I he danger is that this could be seen
as ,111 alternative, said John Rennie, edi
tor of Scientific American magazine. "But
c loning is just one more tool to use along
with the rest ol the measures we already
lake lo preserve spet ies."
I veil some critics of cloning say the
AC I researchers mav have stumbled
upon ,i positive use of the let hnologv.
