## The 						Stanford Daily New Hillel policy mandates donation for High Holidays 
### 
Published Since IS 1 )I

For the first time in 2.~> years, Hillel at
Stanford is requiring donations from
community members who wish to
attend services on campus during the
Jewish High Holidays. It is unfortunate that
Hillel has departed from its previous long
standing polio that embodied the communal
spirit of the season.
While this new polio continues to admit Stan
ford students, fat ultv and stall to services free of
charge, Hillel now requires a minimum contri
bution of $ ISO from residents of the surround
ing areas w ho wish to attend worship services at
Stanford on Rosh I lashanah and Yom Kippur.
In liis "()pen Letter to the (Community," the
president of HillcTs board ol directors, Robert
M. Rosen/weig, explained how changing cir
cumstances have influenced the decision to
implement the new polio. I nderstandablv. ;is
the Jewish population of Silicon Valley and the
number of Jews on campus has steadilv grown
over the past quarter-century, higher demand
has strained 11 ilit is abilit\ to support and orga
nize services.
According to Dcbra Keldstein, Hillel s cxccu
ti\'e director, annual serv ices now cost $">(),()()().

I his week's services comsuine most of the orga
nization's autumn budget. Feldstein said that
High Holiday spending leaves little remaining
funds for student initiatives throughout the
lall.
Indeed, Hillel feels that the former open
services policy both reduced the emphasis on
students in general and inhibited Hillels
c apac ity to involve incoming freshmen in Jew
ish life at Stanford. Hillel says that its main
obligation is to its campus constituency.
I lie commitment to enrich Jewish life here
at Stanford and to focus on a student-orient
ed approach is both admirable and appropri
ate ... for most of the year.
I he High Holidays, however, are a special
case. By their very nature, Rosh Hashanah, the
Jewish New Year, and Yom Kippur, the Day of
Attoncmcnt, are clavs set apart from the rest ol
the vcar as times tor communal bonding, cele
bration, worship «iiid rellection. I bus, by recon
figuring the central events ol I ligli I lolidav wor
ship into "fec-for-servicc" ac tivities, Hillel s new
policy violates tlu- spirit of inclusion and sharing
that has traditionally characterized its own val
ues as well as those ol the Jewish community at

huge and of the Holiday season.
Furthermore, the financial argument for Hil
lel's decision remains unclear. Assuming that
Hillel would rent out the necessary venues and
pay to run services every year regarless of
whetlier they were Stanford-only or communi
ty-inclusive, how does filling the auditoriums to
capacity with community members cost Hillel
any more? Memorial, Dinkelspiel and Kresge
Auditoriums are large enough to accomodate
everyone on campus and the aurrounding area
who wants to attend 1 lillel's services.
It seems that Hillel is trying either to raise
money for Jewish student lile initiatives or to
inhibit community-member attendance in
order to rcfocus the services 011 students. If this
is the case, requiring donations for either pur
pose is unfair.
Community members should neither have
to subsidize student activities nor be discour
aged from participating in High Holiday wor
ship. While the aim of enriching and focusing
on Jewish life on campus in a noble one, it does
not necessitate the exclusion of the surround
ing community.
Iwenty-five years ago, Stanford Hillel pro-

vie led the only High Holiday worship option
for many Jews. In his "Open Letter, Rosen
zweig himself descibed how High Holiday ser
vices at 11 illcl were his family's "introduction to
the community' and provided them with a
"Jewish connection when no other yet existed
upon their arrival at Stanford.
With so many temples now serving their
own congregations, it seems that most commu
nity members attending Stanford services
would either be people new to the area or non
synagogue affiliated |ews who don t have a reg
ular temple to attend. Therefore, Hillel's new
policy seems to contradict the spirit of welcome
that, by his own telling, embraced Rosenzweig
when he arrived.
Though it is not stated in the official policy,
Feldstein said that Hillel will not turn away
anyone for whom the cost of services is a con
cern. Moreover, it is true that most community
members can afford to donate the minimum
amount. But that is hardly the point.
Like every other religious organization, Hillel
at Stanford should request donations, but not
mandate contributions as the price of reconnect
ing with one's community and one's God.
