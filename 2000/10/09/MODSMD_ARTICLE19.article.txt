# ELLIPSIS
## Stanford style is dead 
### 
A i some point, you will notice
tlnit there is something radical
1\ different about Stanlbrd. No
matter what our expectations
of this institution mav be prior to our
matriculation, there is something that
becomes apparent clavs. weeks, months,
and even years alter we start to call Stan
ford "home." In a word: Stanford is sit k.
and with respects to (leorge Clarlin, we
are .ill diseased.
Stanford is sold to the world as an
oasis of noncompetitive, relaxed intensi
ty in the dog-eat-dog desert ol world
class academia, where students repott
ecll\ sabotage ea< li other in order to get
to, and sta\. at the head ol the ( lass. At
Stanford, the sunn\ weather apparently
burns awa\ the competitive rancor and
cutthroat dealings that reputedly char
acterize certain academic institutions on
the Kast ('.oast, and leaves us all with the
cool breeze of the winds ol freedom.
Right.
Look around vou, and what do you
see? A disproportionate number of
bleat bed-blond heads, people spending
extravaganth in ordei to appear dressed
down to each other, the endless relay
race that is the Campus Drive Loop,
fountain-hopping mobs, and conversa
tions in whi( h people do their best to not
use "big words." W hat's going on?
M\ understanding, which has devel
oped over tm three vears here, is that an
atmosphere ol enforced nonchalance is
as oppressive as a hyper-competitive
pressure-cooker. We may not be into
conspicuous studying, or wearing all
nighters and sleep-deprivation like
badges on our sleeves, but we advertise
our relaxation and leisure activities to the
point of lunacv. Observe, on any given
dav, your dormmatcs or housemates
who wot k hard to prove to the rest ol the
university that they haven't spent any
time working that day; symptoms
include excessive guitar playing,
bleat bed-blond hair, and sitting outside
for hours on end. doing nothing.
What Stanford has done is drive the
relationship between work and results

inio the closet. Success is taken lor grant
ed, and the work towards that end is
viewed with shame. I lence we have spec
tacularb hulled bodies belonging to
people who claim never to work out,
oul\ to sneak to I residder Fitness at odd
hours, brilliant minds who claim never
to studv, daring onlv to ( rack open the
books after everyone else is asleep, and
legions ol workaholics in denial, facing
delirium tremens throughout the day
while thc\ walk in the foothills or bask
for hours in the sun.
It's entirely possible to find me unrea
sonable .tnd outrageous on these mai
lers. I his max seem lo you to be .1 per
fe(il\ healthv order ol iliings. but il
frightens me. I lie price that we pav lor
an environment that is superficially
stress-free is high, and nowhere as evi
dent as il is in our personal relationships.
Not being able to admit our travails
and hardships to one another leaves us
ultimatelv loneh. " I he awful daring of
,1 moment's surrender", to quote I .S.
F.liot, is life-delming, life-giving; at
Stanford, we replace it with poor sub
stitutes iu our desperation to never pre
sent a vulnerable, flawed, and ultimate
lv human lace lo the others around us.
We hide behind small talk until the bot
tle loosens our hearts for long enough
to sa\ what we really mean. We avoid
intiinac v through the ubiquitous "hook
up. where the Iren/ied motions of
hands and faces stand in for the desire
to connect to another living, breathing
person. W hile our late-night conversa
tions in our dorm hallways may be
long, they are always lacking â€” for as
long .is we lock away those defining,
integral component of ourselves, our
rigor, discipline, and weaknesses, we
are merely Stanford's shadow puppets
and photographic fodder for next
year's prospectus.
I'd like to think we can do better than
that.
