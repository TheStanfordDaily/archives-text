lust few minutes trying to remove the micro

that," sophomore Jonathan Akchin said. "I
thought it was hilarious, and a lot of the com

Comedian Bill Maher of "Politically Incorrect'' delivers his monologue to a full house Friday night in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Mallei also critic ized the presi
dential and vice presidential can
didates lor iodising 011 religion in
!lie election.
"Lieberman mentions Cod
more than a nymphomaniac <it an
orgy," Malier said.
Alter lie finished the mono
logue, Maher brought out his
lour guests lor the evening: Cali
fornia State Sen. John Vasconcel
los (l)-San Jose); Andrea Abbate,
a stand-up comedian in Ikt third
season .is executive producer ol
the television show "Rude Awak
ening;" Debra J. Saunders, a
columnist for I lie San Francisco
(llironicle; and Martin Andei son,
the Keith and Jan 11 urlbiit Senior
Fellow at the Hoover Institution
since 1971.
I he crowd was definitely not
;is excited about the- panel as they
were by Mailer's monologue.
"I thought the panel was pret
ty weak," Akchin said. "There
were a lot of people who were try
ing to . . . play the audience and
others who weren't saying any
thing at all, so it was a combina
tion ol showmanship and sheer
boredom."
Anderson, former senior poli
cy advisor lor Ronald Reagan,
was the most entertaining of the
four guests, at least judging by
the audience's reaction to his
comments, including, "Politicians
don't do what people with money
tell them to do," and, "frees
cause more pollution than cars."
Saunders, who categorized
herself as a "pro-choice Republi
can. " c ritic i/ed affn illative ac tion,
which angered many in atten
dance.
"You're very young. You don't
know what it was iike getting a job
2f) years ago," he said.
I he final two panelists were <11
opposite sides of the personality
spectrum. While Vaseoncellos
hardly opened his mouth during
the entire show, Abbate repeated

ly made sexual comments about
herself, prostitutes and gays.
Maher verbally ridiculed his
guests for being timid and up
tight during the show, but after
ward he said he supported the
panelists.
"You have to understand
these live versions," Maher said.
"They're not people who do it
professionally. 1 thought they did
a good job."
Maher also said the crowd was
a little more quiet than he was
used to.
" I "hey''re a very [p< >lit ically cc>l
- c rowd," Maher said, refer
ring to Stanford students. "There
are schools that are very
I'd . . . this is one of them. That's
not <i criticism. You can just tell."
The show concluded with a
question and answer session with
the audience. The students pri
marily asked politically and so
cially-oriented questions ranging
from third-party candidates and
school vouchers to the death
penalty and abortion.
"I think [the show] was a great
success," said VVes Radez, direc
tor of the Stanford Concert Net
work, which helped coordinate
the event in conjunction with the
ASSI Speakers Bureau. "Theau
ditorium was packed, and it
seemed like people had a good
time."
Mailer's visit to the Farm was a
part ol 1 1 is college tour across the
nation throughout this election
season. However, Maher said
that educating the students was
not the foe us of his tour.
" I he purpose of my tour is not
politic al in any way," Maher said.
"| It is) to make ;i lot of money. I
enjoy m\ work, but I wouldn't do
it lor free."
Maher said he believes that
college students look up to him
because of his candidness.
"1 don't lie to them," Maher
s;iiel. "Fverybody else panders.
I he women |in the audience]
were hissing, but the youth is
even more pandered to a demo
graphic."
