I lave Told You about the Stanford Dish
Snooktims(n revoluiion.stanfbrd.edu:
1. Daddy and I are spending a ton to
send you to Stanford, hut that doesn't
mean you own the plate.
2.1 he Dish area is not a public park and
never was. It's been undeveloped Stan
ford land lot almost 150 years. How
long have you been there?
3. Grandma and Grandpa are worried
that you are going out late at night with
bad elements like SOSA, who just want
to grab land that isn't theirs, without
compensation.
4. You can have too much of a good
thing. Tens of thousands ol people and
their precious doggies roaming at ran
dom for years just loved those defense
less hills to death. Now the hills need to
rest.
f>. Spinach, broccoli and running on
paved paths will make you big and

strong, even if you may not like them.
(>. Stanford could have dosed the whole
place, but is spending a lot of money to
appease the winners. By the way, was
that your scholarship?
7. Most reasonable people think Stan
lord's new rules are totally cool, dude.
8. Daddy and I are proud of your brav
ery, dearest, but we think that "Foothills
Liberation Front" may not look too
good on your resume, compared to
Morgan Stanley.
Three thousand African children die
from malaria every day. Couldn't you
and your playmates spend your indig
nation on a cause that isn't so selfish?
10. Grownups shouldn't throw
tantrums just because they don't get
everything they want.
Love, Mommy.
I\S. Ralph N. sends his regards.
