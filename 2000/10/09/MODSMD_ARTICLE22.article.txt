aire. kachru won the live-\ear Packard Fellowship
in Science and kngineering lasi I uesdav, and be
came one ol onl\ 2 I nni\ei sit\ professors in the na
tion to receive the award.
kaclnu said he was ver\ hap|)\" .titer receiving
the news.
I he fellowship, endowed In the 1 )a\ id and I .utile
Packard Foundation in conjunction with Hewlett-
Packard. was created to allow America's most
promising young professors to continue their re
search with $125,000 per vcar over five years.
kachru earned his doctoral degree at Princeton
in l ( .) ( .) I and began working at Stanford last year. Ile
won the fellowship .is a result ol his work with string
theory and supersvnunctn ideas thai would leave a
humanities student (and even many techies) com
pleteh bewildered.
kachru is trying to combine current phv"sics theo
ries to figure <>ui win the univei se works the way it
does. I le continues ti \ing lo undei stand siring the
ory, win our universe exisis in ilnee large spatial di
mensions. win the universe didn't collapse millions
of years ago and a plethora of other great cosmolog
ical questions.
I here currently exisi two general theories in
physics: quantum mechanics, which deals with
physics on the microscopic s< ale, and Finstein's the
or\ ol genei .il relati\ ii\. which gravit\ on large
scale terms.

"However, a quantum version of Finstein's theo
ry doesn't work," kachru said. "| I he two theories]
are general 1\ incompatible." Current mathe
matical models explain the universe in terms of sev
eral internal dimensions, kac hru said he is trying to
fashion a theory complex enough to describe our
world.
"String theon promises to explain all the things
that we take lor granted, he said. In other words, it
has the capacit\ to unlock the scientific mysteries of
our universe.
kachru plans to continue his work and bring
more researchers to his team.
"The most important ingredient is people, and
we're tr\ ing to attract more of them," he said.
I he higlih acclaimed Packard Fellowship is gen
erall\ given to innovative young s< holars working on
individual projects with lots of involvement from col
leagues or students.
F.va Silvcrstein, an assistant professor at the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator ('.enter, was one of the indi
viduals who collaborated with kachru on his current
research.
She commented on his award by saving, "I think
it's fantastic. It's definitely well-deserved, and we're
looking forward to making use of the opportunities
it provides."
kachru sa\s that he has enjoyed his Stanford ex
perience thus far.
"It's great ... a vcr\ stimulating atmosphere, and
the people are ver\ fun," he said.
II this is am indication, the future of Stanford
physics seems ver\ bright and promising indeed.
I ake that, Regis.
