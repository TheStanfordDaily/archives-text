Willi convincing wins over Washington and
Washington State, the Stanford women's volleyball
team had exactly the kind of weekend it wanted and
needed.
Alter playing two great games, getting excellent
performances from all of the team's starters and re
ceiving some strong play from players ofl the bench,
sophomore outside hitter Ashley Ivy summed lip
the Cardinal squad's weekend perfectly.
"It feels like we're Stanford again."
On the court, the Cardinal (9-6, 4-4 Pacific 10
Conference) certainly looked much more like the
Stanford teams of the past several seasons, snapping
its four-game losing streak with Friday's 3-1 victory
over Washington State (10-0,1-4) and winning
again on Saturday 3-0 over Washington (-4-10, 0-7).
I he end oi the losing streak brought a welcome
sense of relief to the Stanford squat! after Friday's
match, which was clearly visible in the team's re
laxed play on Saturday.
"We won. That's the super-simple answer," said
team captain Lindsay Kagawa. "But in all honesty
it's the most important one. It was important for us
to win [for] Pac-1() standings and morale."
Friday's win over the Cougars was highlighted
by the Cardinal's strong play at the net. Stanford
posted >i season-high 2.S blocks,
and the team's strong blocking and
consistent, hard attacks lorced
Washington State to commit 12
hitting errors during the match,
holding the (lougars to . 167 team
attack percentage.
