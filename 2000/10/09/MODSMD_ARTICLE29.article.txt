II the demolition tour of the
Notre Dame golf course taken by
the No. 2 Cardinal men's cross
country team Friday afternoon
proved anything, it's that Stan
lord running is quickly distancing
itself lrom the competition.
The Cardinal dismantled a
field of 22 teams Friday in Indi
ana, including live of the lop 25
teams in the nation, scoring just
23 points to runner-up Arizona's
116.
Redshirt freshman Grant Ro
hison led the charge for i lit* Car
dinal,blazing to a second-place
finish in 24 minutes and 5 sec
onds, just nine seconds back ol
winner Luke Watson of Notre
Dame.
Robison spent a year on the
Farm in 1997-98 before taking a
two-year hiatus to complete a
Mormon mission in South Africa.
Friday marked his return to the
eight-kilometer cross country
race.
lusi one second behind him
were teammates Thomas Mm ley,
a senior, and freshman Donald
Sage, who captured third and
fourth place, respectively.
The race was Murley's first on
the trails since his Kith-plate fin
ish at the NCAA meet last year
and marked Sage's first run as a
lull-fledged member oil lie Cardi
nal squad.
After watching Sage's strong
showing in the open-division race
at Stanford hist week, Cardinal
coaches Vin Lmanna and Mike
Reilly decided to lift his redshirt
status and allow him to start con
tributing. And with good reason
â€” as a 4:00.2 miler in high school,
Sage was touted as the best recruit
by any college in the last SO years.
