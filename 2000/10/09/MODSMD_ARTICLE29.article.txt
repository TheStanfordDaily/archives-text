II the demolition tour of the
Notre Dame golf course taken by
the No. 2 Cardinal men's cross
country team Friday afternoon
proved anything, it's that Stan
lord running is quickly distancing
itself lrom the competition.
The Cardinal dismantled a
field of 22 teams Friday in Indi
ana, including live of the lop 25
teams in the nation, scoring just
23 points to runner-up Arizona's
116.
Redshirt freshman Grant Ro
hison led the charge for i lit* Car
dinal,blazing to a second-place
finish in 24 minutes and 5 sec
onds, just nine seconds back ol
winner Luke Watson of Notre

Robison spent a year on the
Farm in 1997-98 before taking a
two-year hiatus to complete a
Mormon mission in South Africa.
Friday marked his return to the
eight-kilometer cross country
race.
lusi one second behind him
were teammates Thomas Mm ley,
a senior, and freshman Donald
Sage, who captured third and
fourth place, respectively.
The race was Murley's first on
the trails since his Kith-plate fin
ish at the NCAA meet last year
and marked Sage's first run as a
lull-fledged member oil lie Cardi
nal squad.
After watching Sage's strong
showing in the open-division race
at Stanford hist week, Cardinal
coaches Vin Lmanna and Mike
Reilly decided to lift his redshirt
status and allow him to start con
tributing. And with good reason
— as a 4:00.2 miler in high school,
Sage was touted as the best recruit
by any college in the last SO years.
Stanford packed all of its scor
ers into the top eight positions,
with redshirt sophomore Daniel
fail is in sixth (24:17) and sopho
more Setli Ilejny in eighth
(24:21).
Redshirt freshman Andrew
