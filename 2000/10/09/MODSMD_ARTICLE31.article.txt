### MINAYO NASIALI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's cross country team is.i lean,
mean, well-oiled machine, as demonstrated by their
sweep at the Notre Dame Cross Country Invitational
last Friday.
I he No. 1 Cardinal crushed SO teams from around
the nation at the invitational in South Bend, Ind., by
placing three runners in the top five spots to win with a
final score of 35 points. No. IS Michigan trailed in a dis
tant second with 143 points.
Sophomore Erin Sullivan, freshman Jillian Mas
troianni and sophomore Flesh man led the
Stanford attack, finishing second, third and fourth, re
spcc lively. Sheela Agrawal of I Hike won the race with a
lime of 17 minutes, five seconds, while Katie Ja/winski
of Michigan rounded up the top five in 17:24.
Sullivan's lime of 17:15, and Mastroianni's 17:19, are
both improvements over previous meets. As the season
progresses, the performances of the individual team
members, as well as the leant itself, will likely continue
to improve.
As seen in the 2-3-4 finish at Notre Dame and faster
times on the trails, the Cardinal is well on its way to
strong mid-season, and an impressive national perfor
mance.
Flesh man returned to compete after an early-season
hiatus, and finished fourth with 17:23. Flesh man had
an outstanding freshman campaign last season, and her
improvement throughout the year led her to the 1,500-
meter title at this summer's USA Junior National
(championship. Fleshman was among a contingent of
Cardinal harriers at the United Slates Olympic Trials,
where she ran the 5,000 meters. She did not rat e earli
er this season to allow her legs to recover from summer
competition.
Mastroianni continues to excel as a new addition to
the team. A three-year Footl(x:ker Nationals participant
and eight-time New York state titleist in distance events,
the freshman from Sayville, N.Y., came to the Farm
with out standing credentials. This weekend's personal
best time contests to the smooth transition she appears
to have made between high school and college racing.
"This college thing is still new to me," Mastroianni
said. "I'm just taking it one meet at a time. I felt 1 had a
very strong race on Friday, and my main goal for the
season is to continue to improve."
Beyond the top three runners, the Cardinal depth
sinned at Notre Dame, with the rest of the squad pro
ducing fast times and solid finishes. Sophomore Katie
Uotchkiss finished in 12th placet 17:33), senior Anne
(iunnison was just behind to claim the Kith slot( 17:37),
and redshirt Ireslnnan l.indsa\ Hyatt (17:52), a middle
distance specialist on the track, placed 24th.
While Stanford's lootball players struggled to adjust
to the Indiana cold in their game at Notre Dame, ac
cording to assistant cross country coach Dena Evans,
neither the weather nor the time difference seemed to
have an effect on her team's performance. When the
gun sounded lor the women's race at 4:15 p.m. central
