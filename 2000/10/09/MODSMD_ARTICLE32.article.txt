# Football fights errors, loses to Irish
## 
### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. —In col
lege football, the difference be
tween a Rose Howl season and a
New Year's Day spent sitting at
home can be as miniscule .is a
handful of plays.
A fortuitous bounce here, a
fluky catch there and the receiving
team acquires that special aura
they call "destiny."
In 1999, that team was the
Stanford Cardinal.
Now, it seems, the good leel
ings and lucky wins from last
year's run to Pasadena have worn
off, and what is left is a team pon
dering the direction ol its season
after a tough 20-14 loss at Notre
Dame (.V2) on Saturday.
The plays that killed the (lardi
nal's hopes — a lost fumble in

Notre 1 )ame territory, a recovered
fumble thai was called back and a
blocked pniii — were exactly the
sort of big, momentum-c hanging
plays Stanford (2-3, 1-1 Pacific 10
Conference) look advantage of
last year.
"We missed some opportuni
ties and missed some plays we
should've made," said Stanford
head coach Iyrone Willingham.
"Those missed opportunities hurt
us in the end."
Amazingly, the Cardinal had a
chance, albeit miniscule, to win
the game as the fourth quarter
ticked down.
Redshirt freshman quarter
back Chris Lewis led the offense
90 yards in 1 minute, IK seconds,
to a 14-yard touchdown by Darin
Naaijes, narrowing the lighting
Irish lead to six points. With 1:07
left, Stanford's hopes rested on an

onside ki< k l>\ senior Mike Bisclli,
bui Notre Dame recovered the
kick and ran the clock out to end
the game.
Lewis was making only the sec
ond start of Ins career on Satur
day, but Irish QB Matt LoVecchio
was making his first, and as a true
freshman to boot. LoVecchio
started Notre Dame oil on the
right loot with an 1 1-play, 01-yard
scoring drive early in the first
quarter, finishing oil the march by
connecting with Hanker David
(livens to put the Irish up 7-0.
That first drive Ibund the ('.ar
dinal dealing with some ol the
more unusual formations the de
fense had seen in a while. ()n one
play the Irish lined up in a wish
bone formation, with three run
ning hacks.and ran a passing pl<i\

Senior Jamien McCullum carries the ball for the Cardinal in this weekend's
oss to Notre Dame, leaving a trail of Fighting Irish defenders behind him.
On the next, Stanford was con
fronted with a spread formation
with live receivers and an empty
backfield, typicallv indicating pass,
onlv to have the mobile LoVecchio
run fora large gain. Ii was unlike
anything the Cardinal had seen all
year, and the Irish took advantage.
" I here were two or three things
they had not done," said defensive
coordinator Kent Baer, "[but ] once
we got a leel for the personnel
groups, then we adjusted pretty
well. It was a surprise, and a good
thought on their part."
Baer's assessment wast ight on.
Alter that first drive, the Cardinal
defense would only give up 175
total yards to ihe Notre Dame of
lense the rest of the game, with
both remaining scores coming after
Stanford turnovers.
Toward the end ol the first
quarter, after three drives result
ing in punts, it looked like the (Car

dinal would catch a break when
Notre Dame's Ferrance Howard
fumbled at about midfield, and
Stanford end Marcus Hoover re
covered the ball. The officials
never signaled the ball belonged
to Stanford, and after conversing
for several minutes determined
that ,m "inadvertent whistle" had
blown. Baer and linebacker Riall
Johnson both said they did not
hear a whistle; the ever-diplomat
ic VVillingham would only say,
"That's always debatable."
Midway through the second
quarter, with Notre Dame still lead
ing 7-0, Lewis finally got the Cardi
nal offense going on a sustained
drive, completing three passes and
leading Stanford down to the Irish
15-yard line before the first obvious
miscue caused by the 40-degree
weather ended the drive.
"It was cold out there," Lewis
said. "Usually I'll be able to grip
that hall. I pulled out and just
couldn't grip the football, and it
came out. It was just one of those
two plays that you've got to make.
We had a good play going, but it

was just my fault."
The resulting fumble was recov
ered by Notre Dame defensive end
Anthony Weaver, keeping a goose
egg on the scoreboard next to Stan
ford's name.
At the end of the quarter, with
seconds to go until halftime, the
game turned on the same type of
play that aided Stanford in its upset
of the Texas Longhorns three
weeks ago.
With about 40 seconds left, se
nior punter (nee placekicker) Mike
Biselli look the snap on fourth
down at his own 25, only to have
Notre Dame's Civens race up the
middle untouched to block the
punt, which lie recovered at the
Stanford 10-yard line. One play
later, LoVecchio found Civens in
the corner of the end/one for an
eight-yard touchdown pass and a
shot of momentum heading into
halftime.
Lewis's fumble and the blocked
kick provided Notre Dame with a
111-point scoring swing, assuming
Stanford would have scored a
touchdown on the drive. Instead of

7-7 at halftime, the score was 13-0,
Irish, after Willie Howard blocked
the PA T for the Cardinal.
Stanford finally got on the board
in the third quarter thanks to a
brief two-play drive, with Brian
Allen taking a handofl up the mid
dle, bouncing outside and scam
pering 71 yards to the Notre Dame
13. Lewis found senior receiver
Deßonnie Pius on a 13-yard slant
on the next play to make the store
13-7 in favor of Notre Dame.
Another Cardinal miscue led to
points for the Fighting Irish at the
end of the third quartet after cor
nerback Brock Williams plucked a
tipped Lewis pass out of the air and
fell at the Stanford 34-yard line.
LoVecchio tossed a 24-yard com
pletion to Julius Jones, and then
Jones ran the ball in from seven
yards out, increasing the Notre
I )ame lead to 20-7.
The Cardinal got dose in the
fourth, but Biselli missed a 20-yard
field goal wide right, and Lewis's
last-gasp drive .n the end would be
the only other time Stanford
snifled the end/one.

blown. Baer and linebacker Riall
Johnson both said they did not
hear a whistle; the ever-diplomat
ic VVillingham would only say,
"That's always debatable."
Midway through the second
quarter, with Notre Dame still lead
ing 7-0, Lewis finally got the Cardi
nal offense going on a sustained
drive, completing three passes and
leading Stanford down to the Irish
15-yard line before the first obvious
miscue caused by the 40-degree
weather ended the drive.
"It was cold out there," Lewis
said. "Usually I'll be able to grip
that hall. I pulled out and just
couldn't grip the football, and it
came out. It was just one of those
two plays that you've got to make.
We had a good play going, but it

was just my fault."
The resulting fumble was recov
ered by Notre Dame defensive end
Anthony Weaver, keeping a goose
egg on the scoreboard next to Stan
ford's name.
At the end of the quarter, with
seconds to go until halftime, the
game turned on the same type of
play that aided Stanford in its upset
of the Texas Longhorns three
weeks ago.
With about 40 seconds left, se
nior punter (nee placekicker) Mike
Biselli look the snap on fourth
down at his own 25, only to have
Notre Dame's Civens race up the
middle untouched to block the
punt, which lie recovered at the
Stanford 10-yard line. One play
later, LoVecchio found Civens in
the corner of the end/one for an
eight-yard touchdown pass and a
shot of momentum heading into
halftime.
Lewis's fumble and the blocked
kick provided Notre Dame with a
111-point scoring swing, assuming
Stanford would have scored a
touchdown on the drive. Instead of

7-7 at halftime, the score was 13-0,
Irish, after Willie Howard blocked
the PA T for the Cardinal.
Stanford finally got on the board
in the third quarter thanks to a
brief two-play drive, with Brian
Allen taking a handofl up the mid
dle, bouncing outside and scam
pering 71 yards to the Notre Dame
13. Lewis found senior receiver
Deßonnie Pius on a 13-yard slant
on the next play to make the store
13-7 in favor of Notre Dame.
Another Cardinal miscue led to
points for the Fighting Irish at the
end of the third quartet after cor
nerback Brock Williams plucked a
tipped Lewis pass out of the air and
fell at the Stanford 34-yard line.
LoVecchio tossed a 24-yard com
pletion to Julius Jones, and then
Jones ran the ball in from seven
yards out, increasing the Notre
I )ame lead to 20-7.
The Cardinal got dose in the
fourth, but Biselli missed a 20-yard
field goal wide right, and Lewis's
last-gasp drive .n the end would be
the only other time Stanford
snifled the end/one.
SOUTH BEND, Ind. —In col
lege football, the difference be
tween a Rose Howl season and a
New Year's Day spent sitting at
home can be as miniscule .is a
handful of plays.
A fortuitous bounce here, a
fluky catch there and the receiving
team acquires that special aura
they call "destiny."
In 1999, that team was the
Stanford Cardinal.
Now, it seems, the good leel
ings and lucky wins from last
year's run to Pasadena have worn
off, and what is left is a team pon
dering the direction ol its season
after a tough 20-14 loss at Notre
Dame (.V2) on Saturday.
The plays that killed the (lardi
nal's hopes — a lost fumble in

Notre 1 )ame territory, a recovered
fumble thai was called back and a
blocked pniii — were exactly the
sort of big, momentum-c hanging
plays Stanford (2-3, 1-1 Pacific 10
Conference) look advantage of
last year.
"We missed some opportuni
ties and missed some plays we
should've made," said Stanford
head coach Iyrone Willingham.
"Those missed opportunities hurt
us in the end."
Amazingly, the Cardinal had a
chance, albeit miniscule, to win
the game as the fourth quarter
ticked down.
Redshirt freshman quarter
back Chris Lewis led the offense
90 yards in 1 minute, IK seconds,
to a 14-yard touchdown by Darin
Naaijes, narrowing the lighting
Irish lead to six points. With 1:07
left, Stanford's hopes rested on an

onside ki< k l>\ senior Mike Bisclli,
bui Notre Dame recovered the
kick and ran the clock out to end
the game.
Lewis was making only the sec
ond start of Ins career on Satur
day, but Irish QB Matt LoVecchio
was making his first, and as a true
freshman to boot. LoVecchio
started Notre Dame oil on the
right loot with an 1 1-play, 01-yard
scoring drive early in the first
quarter, finishing oil the march by
connecting with Hanker David
(livens to put the Irish up 7-0.
That first drive Ibund the ('.ar

more unusual formations the de

DAVE GONZAIES/The Stanford Daily
Senior Jamien McCullum carries the ball for the Cardinal in this weekend's
oss to Notre Dame, leaving a trail of Fighting Irish defenders behind him.
On the next, Stanford was con
fronted with a spread formation
with live receivers and an empty
backfield, typicallv indicating pass,
onlv to have the mobile LoVecchio
run fora large gain. Ii was unlike
anything the Cardinal had seen all
year, and the Irish took advantage.
" I here were two or three things
they had not done," said defensive
coordinator Kent Baer, "[but ] once
we got a leel for the personnel
groups, then we adjusted pretty
well. It was a surprise, and a good
thought on their part."
Baer's assessment wast ight on.
Alter that first drive, the Cardinal
defense would only give up 175
total yards to ihe Notre Dame of
lense the rest of the game, with
both remaining scores coming after
Stanford turnovers.
Toward the end ol the first
quarter, after three drives result
ing in punts, it looked like the (Car

dinal would catch a break when
Notre Dame's Ferrance Howard
fumbled at about midfield, and
Stanford end Marcus Hoover re
covered the ball. The officials
never signaled the ball belonged
to Stanford, and after conversing
for several minutes determined
that ,m "inadvertent whistle" had
blown. Baer and linebacker Riall
Johnson both said they did not
