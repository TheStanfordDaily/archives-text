SOUTH BEND, Ind. —In col
lege football, the difference be
tween a Rose Howl season and a
New Year's Day spent sitting at
home can be as miniscule .is a
handful of plays.
A fortuitous bounce here, a
fluky catch there and the receiving
team acquires that special aura
they call "destiny."
In 1999, that team was the
Stanford Cardinal.
Now, it seems, the good leel
ings and lucky wins from last
year's run to Pasadena have worn
off, and what is left is a team pon
dering the direction ol its season
after a tough 20-14 loss at Notre
Dame (.V2) on Saturday.
The plays that killed the (lardi
nal's hopes — a lost fumble in

Notre 1 )ame territory, a recovered
fumble thai was called back and a
blocked pniii — were exactly the
sort of big, momentum-c hanging
plays Stanford (2-3, 1-1 Pacific 10
Conference) look advantage of
last year.
"We missed some opportuni
ties and missed some plays we
should've made," said Stanford
head coach Iyrone Willingham.
"Those missed opportunities hurt
us in the end."
Amazingly, the Cardinal had a
chance, albeit miniscule, to win
the game as the fourth quarter
ticked down.
Redshirt freshman quarter
back Chris Lewis led the offense
90 yards in 1 minute, IK seconds,
to a 14-yard touchdown by Darin
Naaijes, narrowing the lighting
Irish lead to six points. With 1:07
left, Stanford's hopes rested on an

onside ki< k l>\ senior Mike Bisclli,
bui Notre Dame recovered the
kick and ran the clock out to end
the game.
Lewis was making only the sec
ond start of Ins career on Satur
day, but Irish QB Matt LoVecchio
was making his first, and as a true
freshman to boot. LoVecchio
started Notre Dame oil on the
right loot with an 1 1-play, 01-yard
scoring drive early in the first
quarter, finishing oil the march by
connecting with Hanker David
(livens to put the Irish up 7-0.
That first drive Ibund the ('.ar
dinal dealing with some ol the
more unusual formations the de
fense had seen in a while. ()n one
play the Irish lined up in a wish
bone formation, with three run
ning hacks.and ran a passing pl<i\
