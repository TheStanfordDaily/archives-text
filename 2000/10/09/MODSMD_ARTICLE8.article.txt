fbi his money ( base, seeing the need for re-election
money as outweighing any possible damage.

Astronomers detect a
group of new planets
An inlet national team of astronomers today report
ed finding evidence of I <S homeless planets floating free
in space near ()rion's belt. I nlike the 50 or so other dis
tant planets discovered 111 the last few vears, the newest
candidates are not orbiting any central star.
I he report, published 111 Friday's issue of Science,
suggests that galaxies max be filled with planets and
their larger kin, < ailed brown dwarfs. "The objects we
are < ning are so numerous thai it has an implication lor
the galactic population," savs Maria R. Zapatero ()sorio,
the lead author of the report and <1 postdoctoral scholar
at the (California Institute ol I ethnology .
Ms. Zapatero ()s<»i io and her colleagues detected the
IS potential planets (left), which are many times the si/.e
of Jupiter, by measuring faint visible and infrared light
emanating from a cluster of voung stars in the ()rion
constellation. By studving their spectra — 01 strength
ofdillerent wavelengths ol light — the team deter
mined that the dim reddish beacons were small, rela
tively cool bodies within the star duster.
