Invest your intellectual capital wisely.
At the I). E. Shaw group, you'll learn that technical and quantitative excellence
can translate into financial success. We started out in 1988 with an ambitious plan
for applying quantitative and computational techniques to the securities
business. Since then, we've grown into about a dozen closely related entities
with approximately $1 billion in aggregate capital. Our success is due largely to
the fact that the people who design and carry out our strategies are as much
scientists and engineers as they are businesspeople. In fact, we may be the only
investment firm whose Ph.D.s outnumber its MBAs.
If you have an outstanding record of academic success in any quantitative or
technical field, from computer science to astrophysics, you may find that a career
at the 1). E. Shaw group can be unexpectedly rewarding. And, working with some
of the world's leading computer scientists, mathematicians, physicists, and
financial engineers in an intensely focused but surprisingly casual environment,
you'll have the chance to keep your intellectual capital growing.
