1979
On October 10, 1979, The Daily pub
lished an article on "Kids' colorful cre
ations shown."
" 'That looks just like my four-year-old's
first crayon drawing!'
" 'It reminds me of an exhibit I saw at
the Guggenheim Museum when we were
in New York last month.'
"These comments were made by some
admirers of a painting by a six-year-old
Japanese boy that was part of Bechtel In
ternational Center s Kids Art Display Sun
day afternoon.
'The exhibit, which commemorated the
United Nations' International Year of the
(Ihild. featured over 200 drawings and
paintings by children, aged 3 to l!i, from
32 countries... .
" ' Television and the commercialization
of primary education may be robbing our
children of some of their natural creativi
ty,' she [Rhoda Kellogg, director of the
Golden Gate Kindergarten Association]
said.
Bottom line: That two people looked at a 6-year
old's drawing and one compared it to a 4-year
old's and the other compared it to an exhibit in
the Guggenheim Museum is a rather disturbing
commentary about the state of art today.
