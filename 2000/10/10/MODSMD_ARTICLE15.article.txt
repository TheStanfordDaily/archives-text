## Arafat, Barak remain steadfast 
### 
| ERI JSALEM (AP) — World leaders scram
bled yesterday to persuade Israeli Prime Min
ister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yass
er Arafat to keep the peace process alive, but
each man held last to his imperative: I lie
other side needs to stop firing first.
I he region was largely quiet as night fell,
with tlie sporadic clashes that erupted in sev
eral towns this weekend having died down. In
the centers of power, though, diplomatic
brinkmanship continued: Barak convened an
emergent ) Cabinet meeting to assess whether
Arafat had met the Israeli ultimatum to cease
attacks last night, and Israeli commanders said
the) were ready to strike if not.
"We will not let Palestinians kill another
Israeli." sai<l (01. (ial I lirsch, a commander in
the Raniallah region of the West Bank.
I lirsc h said his troops had held their lire
for two clays — despite provocations — to
allow Aralat time to rein in his gunmen. "We
are ver\ serious, we hope they will not test us
tonight. Our response will be very severe."
A top Arafat aide said the Palestinians did
not leai Israel's greater firepower.
"We are not reach to bow to the Israeli
threats and their blackmail," said Nabil
Shaath, <t Palestinian negotiator. He said that
asking lor a "cease-lire" was inappropriate
when most Palestinians were throwing stones,
not shooting guns: "I Ie should have asked lor
a ceasing of stones, not lire."
I he 24 hours prior to Barak's Monday
night deadline were among the quietest
since the eruption of violence on Sept. 2S,

but Barak's aides refused to assess whether
iliat was enough to declare an end to the
hostilities.
Aralat continued to insist that Barak agree to
let an international committee investigate the
12 days of violence, which have claimed H8 lives
so lar, most Palestinian. 1 lie U.N. Security
Council voted to recommend an "objective
inquiry" last week. Barak has steadfastly
refused.
U.N. Secretary-Ceneral Kofi Annan
arrived in the region Monday evening and
met briefly with ac ting Israeli Foreign Minis
ter Shloino Ben-Ami belore continuing to
Oa/a to meet with Arafat. "The action must
shift from the street to the bargaining table,"
Annan told Ben-Ami.
Annan was not the only world leader trying
hard to get Aralat and Barak to talk. President
(llinton was in regular phone contact with the
leaders, and Aralat had ]u>i returned from a
meeting with Egyptian President llosni
Mubarak. Shaath said Arafat had also taken
calls from French, Italian, Turkish and Span
ish leaders yesterday.
U.S. officials still held out the hope the
leaders would come together fora summit.
"Once the parties slop the violence, we'll
evaluate how to shift the locus to get back to
the peace process to lessen the underlving ten
sion that fuels this violence," said P.J. ( Towlev,
Clinton's national securit\ spokesman.
But both sides said the guns must lall silent
before they would meet.
"We heard about contacts to put together

some kind of regional summit. We believe that
such a gathering can take place only if we
come to it after violence is stopped," Ben-Ami
said.
Shaath was equally as adamant.
"There are things that Israel should do . . .
the Israeli withdrawal from the entrances ol
our c ities, and accepting the establishment ol
an international inquiry into the incidents," he
said. "And after that, we can go to the negoti
ations on a clear basis."
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov was
also in the region, but his mission was espe
cially lonised on stopping the violence from
spreading: a militant Islamic Lebanese guer
rilla group had captured three Israeli soldiers
on Saturday, an act that the guerrillas dedicat
ed to the Palestinians.
Barak threatened to respond "with force"
and said he put responsibility lor the capture
on Lebanon and Syria, the main power
there.
" I he priority now is to slop the escalation,
refrain from using force and resume the dia
logue," Ivanov said after meeting with
Lebanese leaders.
Fighting was sporadic Sunday and yester
day, which coincided with Yoni kippur, the
|ewish Day of Atonement and the holiest da\
in the Jewish calendar.
I here were brief gun battles in the West
Bank towns of Ramallah and Nablus, and
settlers reported gunfire aimed at their vehi
cles as they headed home from Yoni Kippur
visits.
