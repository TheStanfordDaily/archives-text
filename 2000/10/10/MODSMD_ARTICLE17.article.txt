NKW YORK. (AP) — Hillary Rodham Clinton,
locked in a battle for the c ritical Jewish vote, broke
with her husband's administration on Mideast pol
icy during her second debate with Senate rival
Rick La/io.
1 lie first lady sai<l the United States should
have vetoed a I nitecl Nations resolution con
demning the Middle East violence and criticizing
Israel. The resolution passed Saturday with 14
votes and the United States abstaining.
"I believe that ii was a wrong move not to have
vetoed it, thai it was inaccurate and one-sided,"
(llinton said din ing the hour-long debate Sunday.
(llinton .ind Lazio, who also c ritic ized the I nit
ed States on the U.N. vote, sparred on a wide
range ol issues, including c ampaign finance, abor
tion <ind <t domed stadium in Manhattan.
I he debate came with just 30 clays left in their
high-profile and expensive Senate race. A poll out
last week from the Quinnipiac University Polling
Institute had Clinton leading La/io, 50 percent to
43 percent. The poll had a margin of error of plus
or minus 3.5 percentage points.
Clinton took La/io to task for what she called a
violation ol their agreement to ban outside money
from the race.
"Last month, Mr. La/io said this was an issue of
trust and character. He was right," Clinton said.
"And, if New Yorkers can't trust him lo keep his word
for 10 days, how can they trust him for six years."
Lazio, who insists he has not violated the agree
ment, blasted her back, raising I lie issue of
whether the Clintons have used sleepovers at tlie
White House and Camp David to generate cam

paign contributions.
"Mrs. Clinton, please, no lectures from Motel
1000," he said, referring to the While House's
1000 Pennsylvania Avenue address.
Later, ('.linton was asked to explain her dec ision
lo stay with her husband after his affair with Mon
ica Lewinsky became public.
"The choices that I've made in my life are right
for me," she said. "I c an't talk about anybody else's
choices. I can onlv sav mine have been based on
my religious faith, on my strong sense of family
and what I believe is right and important."
La/io was careful not to criticize his opponent on
that; he had been criticized after their first debate
for not being more conciliatory toward her on a
similar question about the president's infidelities.
"I think this was Mrs. Clinton's choice and I
respect whatever choice that she makes, he said.
"This race is about the issues, about who can In
most effective for New York."
On other issues, La/io was asked whom he
admired on the U.S. Supreme Court with particu
lar attention to the abortion issue. I le pic ked San
dra Hay O'Connor, a Republican who supports
abortion rights.
Clinton has said she would never vote to con
firm judges who are opposed to abortion rights.
La/io has refused lo make that a litmus lest for
judicial nominees
1 heir first face-off, on Sept. 13 in Buffalo, was
marked In 1 .a/io walking over to (llinton's podium
and demanding she sign a pledge to ban soft
inoney advertising from the campaign. Clinton
turned that into a joke on Sunday.
