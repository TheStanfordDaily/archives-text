SARASOTA, Ma. (AP) — Willi attention already
shifting to the next presidential debate, Al Core
unveiled a new assault against George VV. Bush,
whose campaign aides said the Democratic nominee
"consistently and repeatedly makes up things while
campaigning.
Both candidates were easing their campaign
schedules yesterday lor debate preparation —
Republican Bush at his I exas ranch and (iore in
Florida — with lew public events before tomorrow
night s confrontation.
There was no such halt in harsh exchanges
between strategists, (.iore stepped up his assault on
Bush, dispatching running mate Joseph Lieberman
to Texas lot a "failed leadership tour" later this week
bashing Bush's record as governor.
That's part of a coordinated assault, in which
surrogates will be sent to battleground states
sounding the same theme. Democratic National
Committee officials said they also will step up
advertising criticizing Bush on environmental,
health and gun-control issues, where thev see him
as vulnerable.
In addition, Democrats are launching a new
assault on Bush's sometimes-jumbled campaign
rhetoric by issuing daily "Bush bloopers."

Campaign oflicials said a portion of the cam
paign's Web site will be devoted to attacking Bush
for those Hubs, and the DNC will launch a "Bush
light" campaign designed to raise questions about
his intellectual capacity.
Lieberman will be sent to I exas after tomorrow's
debate in Winston-Salem, N.C., second in .1 series of
three presidential lace-olls.
Bush .ind his aides have made much of what they
see as Core's tendency to exaggerate on Ins accom
plishments, which they argue raise questions about
Ins credibility. The new (iore offensive is designed to
blunt Bush's attack.
"The vice president has consistently and repeat
edly made up things, exaggerated, embellished
facts," Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes saicl on
"Fox News Sunday."
(iore campaign spokesman Chris l.ehane denied
that the vice president was turning the rate negative
with his new assault.
"We have always saicl we're going to have a com
pare and contrast on the public policy issues,"
Lehanc said. He saicl the timing was designed to
sharpen differences between (iore and Bush in the
campaign's final month, when many voters tune in
lor the first time.
