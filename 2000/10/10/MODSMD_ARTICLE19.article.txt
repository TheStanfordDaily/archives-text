## The 						Stanford Daily SME has admirable goal but lacks publicity, coherence 
### 
Published Since IH'JI

The mission was to give humani
ties-based students a friendly and
interesting introduction to sci
ence. Unfortunately, this mission,
however noble, may have proved impossi
ble for Stanlbrd's Science, Math and Engi
neering Core Program. The programs
much-lamented lack of organization and
inability to achieve its goals thus far speaks
to a profound need for re-evaluation and,
possiblv, reconstitution.
The program's original goal was lofty,
coimnendahle and aimed at addressing
the issue of "fuzzy" students dreading or
sluing awav from science classes. SME's
goal was not only to give these students an
opportunity to satisfy the Area 2 gradua
tion requirement, but ;ilso to provide a
basic and interesting overview of science.
! he program's originators hoped that this

introductory course would lead to more
in-depth explorations by students in sci
ence, math and engineering departments.
This goal has gone largely unfulfilled
because of the flaws inherent in the struc
ture of the program. Despite Stanford's
other success with interdisciplinary pro
grams, SM T. lacks the specific groundwork
necessarv to keep programs like it afloat.
The program s courses are centered
around broad topics called "tracks. The
track is essentially a theme intended to tie
subjects such as biology, chemistry, statis
tics and engineering together. Instead,
professors have struggled to build on their
colleagues' lectures and students have
routinelv complained ol the lack of conti
nuity in content and relation back to the
tracks' larger themes. The program start
ed out with three tracks: Light, Earth and

Heart, but only Earth remains.
SMK's continual reorganization and
students' general lack of excitement about
the program demonstrates that both the
administrators behind the program and
the students in it recognize that it must
have several fundamental problems.
Beyond the issue of organization, one of
public ity and retention also looms large.
Since its inception, SME has been
dec reasinglv well publicized, leading to
the current state in which freshmen,
though informed about SME, are hardly
externally motivated to enroll in the pro
gram. Furthermore, once students enroll
in the program, the flaws in its organiza
tion and continued lack of publicity and
enthusiasm do not encourage students to
remain in SME.
The initial goal of SME — to give fuzzy

students options in the sciences — contin
ues to be an important one. However,
given that revamping SME repeatedly has
not yet yielded positive results, it may be
time for the University to begin exploring
other options for fulfilling that original
admirable goal.
II those concerned can find a way to
offer SMK in a more cohesive and success
ful fashion — with lectures that offer a
broad, yet substantial view of the sciences
and publicity that indicates true support,
among other issues — then perhaps the
program is worth another try. However, il
this is not ulitimately possible, it may be
time to begin looking at alternative solu
tions, such as focusing more attention on
elective science courses lor upperclassmen
still seeking to fulfill their Area 2 gradua
tion requirements.
