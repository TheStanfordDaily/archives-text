## 
### ROBERT MICHELETTI 
Today, the Career Development Center
will bring the largest career fair of"the 2000-
2001 school year to White Plaza in front of
the Stanford Bookstore.
From 11 a.m. to I p.m., more than 300
private, public and non-profit organizations
will make their pitches to undergraduate
and graduate students from all depart
ments. Students will also have the opportu
nity to look over a myriad of internship and
full-time employment opportunities.
I he fair will feature such notable compa
nies as Charles Schwab, IBM, the Cap,
Cisco, CIA, Lucent Technologies, Walt Dis

ney, the Peace Corps and many others.
"My first two years, I went to [the career
fair] just for the experience of talking to cor
porate recruiters and to pic k up all the free
stuff the companies give away," said junior
Meghan O'Connor. "But now that 1 know
my major and what I'm doing with my life,
I'll be looking for specific jobs and intern
ship opportunities."
For those students without a certain ca
reer path in mind, the fair will be a chance to
learn more about specific industries, careers
and organizations.
For juniors, seniors and graduate students
