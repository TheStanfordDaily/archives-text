# STAFF COLUMN
## Making a house a home 
### DANIEL DONOVAN STAFF COLUMNIST 
I begin i his column wiih a disclaimer.
I lii> will not lx* a cute column, specifi
cally, .1 "Stanlord-c uic column. Most
will know what I mean by this term. I
lx-licve .m <irii( le was already wiillen in I lie
DaiK in which ilic typical tongue-in-cheek,
<ute-as-a-button Stanford article was sati
ri/ed in the lorm < >1 directions lor writing the
perfect Stanford newspaper piece. So do not
worn': I will not even write a sell-referential
article .is ii li.is already been written.
I realize that, by writing this disclaimer, I
.1111 being extremelx self-referential and.
thus. e\ponentiall\ cutei than il 1 had |iist
written a Stanford-cute article in the first
place. Maying just pointed out this sell-ref
crentiality, 1. of course, dig myself deeper
into the spiralling pit <>112 self-conscious cute
iless and.the more I write in this vein, the
cutei I become and itie faster I degrade. So
I will stop.
Now that the disc laimer is oyer, I may
Ix'gin in earnest. Win not start oil with the
biggest problem I find at Stanford? Ii is a
problem that lias been written about before,
but, in the spirit of "Mow do you think a
(lie lie'' bet (>ilic's a < li< lie'-?. I Ixlieve this prob
lem lias Ix'en discussed in some circles ad
nauseum for good reason.
And the problem is... the student envi
ronment at Stanford is not intellectual
enough. ()l course, the term "intellectual" is
vague, perhaps inherently. I ll give the word
my own particulat definition. When I write
ol an "intellectual environment," I mean to
indicate an atmosphere in which students
dis( uss either spec ilic know ledge or the pro
cess of acquiring knowledge (a.k.a. learning)
foi its own s.ike and no other.
I lie source of this problem is simple.
Stanford housing is too irregular in its qual
it\ of living and the quantity of students each
building holds to support a strong intellec
tual environment. At schools such as Yale,
students are randomly placed into one of
several different residential colleges, where
they remain for either all four years or at
least the fiist half of their college careers.
I hese colleges are large enough to support
.i varied student Imklv within each house but
small enough to provide an intimate setting
in vvhic h students get to know each other.
In general, a stable social environment
is c reated within each college Ixrause stu
dents are able to settle down and get to
know iheir peers since they know they
aren't going anywhere. I believe it is only
after such a stable environment has been
created m-hoiise that students are able to
sit back, stop asking each othei where

iliev're li'om and what l-11l Milicy tc tak
ing. .md access 11ic less readih accessible
issues 1 hat make up .111 intellei lual envi
ronment, such as ilic role oi Cod in an
individual's li It- or ilie viabilii\ of a tlieorx
on subjective reality. Ii I s - impossible to
lone .111 intellectual environment inio
being; ii simpU happens.
The current housing situation at Stan
lord renders such .1 svsiem linlcasible. foi
starters, how would \ou like to be randoin
l\ plat eel 101 lour 01 even two wars in Sena
while a classmate ol vours lands ,1 spot 111
Xanadu lor the same amount ol time?
Bevond the variation in <|ii.iln\ <>l housing,
there is the issue of numbers. Living with
the same | )<.•<>ple in Crow Mavlield lor lour
wars (even taking into account the dvnani
i( equilibrium thai would exist .is seniors
leave <111<i liosh enter) would not provide
enough variation among students to < reate
.111 intellectual environment siniplx because
there would not be enough people.
So, Stanford is forced to allocate some
houses as all-lfosh, others .is upper-class
and still others ,is lour-class. And students
are constantly filtered 111 and 0111 of each
housing situation. I Ins way, ilic Irosh in
all-lfosh dorms gel to spend a vear conc en
iraling 011 Irving to make acquaintances to
make up lor homesickness and bonding
over <i( liviiies sue Ii ,is flit ks rather than the
harder-10-reach ideas swimming through
their minds. And those in upper-class and
four-class houses rarely liw in the same
place and with the same people for more
than a year.
I 11101 tunaielv, a year is |iisi not enough
to create a stable environment, mostly
because students know they onh have <1 war
in the plat e I hey are living and tail lo "settle
in" <ind just calm down as the) would in a
residential college. Sadly, il always seems .is
if "Draw is looming overhead.
I'm not advocating that Stanford slash
and burn its housing and start all over
again, although it would be nice il that
were possible. I he administration is dearly
trying to construct a residential environ
ment with programs such as Structured
Liberal Lducation and freshman Sopho
more College, but I see little hope thai
these programs will become widespread in
the near future.
In any case, awareness is Ix tter than noth
ing. Perhaps next year, in addition to the
ongoing wonders that the Capital Improve
ment Plan whips up on (ampus, students will
Ik- able to Ix-nelit from senile sort of informal
Intellectual Improvement Program.
