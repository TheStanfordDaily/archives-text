Student responds to Dish letter
"Professor" Paul F. Basch's comments
regarding I her Dish did nothing to dispell
any ill feelings thai students might have.
In lad, all lie realh succeeds in is display
ing Ins pompous attitude and lack ol real
ideas.
112 irst oil, comparing "dying African
Children" to a foothill debate is rather
incomprehensible to me and, second, dis
couraging young environmentalists from
pursuing their passion over a "Morgan
Stanley'" resume blurb shows Professor
Base li s deep generation gap.
Lastly. I actually pity Professor Basch,
for I think he might be one of those
unlucky lew who haven't romped
through the Foothills on <111 unbeaten
path, away from any crowd, or took a
late-night walk to the Dish to ponder the
stars. Fither that or in his great years he
has lost those wonderful memories.
Professor Basch, we are young and we
like to explore. When you were our age.
would you have simply sat back and

watched the hills you loved be taken away
from you? Probably not.
