When ii tonics lo NCAA nun's soccer, lac

Alter its first loss ol the season, 2-1, against
No. 12 Washington (7-.S-0) in overtime Friclax,
the Stanford men's soccer team ( ( .)-l-l) was
looking lor a little redemption. Sunday, the
Cardinal got just that, beating No. 1 I (LA (8-
I-0) 1 -0 handing them their lirst loss this year.

With the win, the (Cardinal moved up a spot
to No. 11. according to the National Soccer

clay, the numbers are deceiving. Despite
recording so nianx shots, onlx 1 I were on
goal, .i statistic thai haunted llieni on Friclax
night as well.
"We had plenty of opportunities to put the

Despite being hit with its lirst
loss of the season, the (lardinal also
managed to take down the No. 1
team in the country. The teams
will now move on to Thursday's
game against Santa Clara pleased
with the weekend's outcome.
"I thought we played well in
both games this weekend and
were a bit unlucky not to win on
Friday," said senior Matt Moses.
"We not only out-shot our oppo
nents in both games but we also
had better chances to score. But, I

think that a loss can sometimes
help a team grow and we will use
that it as a reminder to take a win
out of games that we dominate."
Senior Corey Woolfolk also
commented on the importance of
how the team reacted to the loss.
"In soccer sometimes you can
just come up unlucky and that's
what happened Friday night, "
said Woolfolk. " 1 lie trick is how
you rebound from such a set
back, and 1 think our team
showed real character in doing
that on Sunday."
