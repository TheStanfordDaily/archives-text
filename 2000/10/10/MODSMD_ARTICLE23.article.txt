### ALEX BENJAMIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When ii tonics lo NCAA nun's soccer, lac
ing teams like I ( LA and Washington is about
.is tough as n gets. Facing them both in the
same weekend does not make it am easier.
Alter its first loss ol the season, 2-1, against
No. 12 Washington (7-.S-0) in overtime Friclax,
the Stanford men's soccer team ( ( .)-l-l) was
looking lor a little redemption. Sunday, the
Cardinal got just that, beating No. 1 I (LA (8-
I-0) 1 -0 handing them their lirst loss this year.
For the entire game Stanlbrd and I CLA
traded shots. Finall\, at the b(): H mark sopho
more |ohanes Mali/a put away the game-win
ner, heading in a (toss from senior Sean
Sylvis, for his sixth goal ol the season.
With the win, the (Cardinal moved up a spot
to No. 11. according to the National Soccer
Coaches Association ol'America. Converseh
the Bruins dropped to No. f> from the lop
ranked position, which I hex have held lot the
last live weeks. I lie win also marked the ninth
Cardinal shutout ol die season.
"( onsiclering tli.it II CI.AI xvas a fresh team

and we had two games on the weekend. I
thought it was a tremendous team perfor
mance with a lot ol plavers plaxinga part in
the win, said Stanford head coach
Bobbx ('.lark.
I he remainder ol the game was a storx ol
lough defense and missed opportunities. Al
though Sianlord out-shot I ( LA L'l-7 on the
clay, the numbers are deceiving. Despite
recording so nianx shots, onlx 1 I were on
goal, .i statistic thai haunted llieni on Friclax
night as well.
"We had plenty of opportunities to put the
game awav," Clark said. "Ii could have easilx
been a or l-goal game in our favor, howev
er after saying that, I xvas very happx i<> heat
the linal whistle. I think that max be bee .tnse ii
was ,i big game, we didn't show the cciniposure
in finishing that we usuallx do ag.inisi lessei
teams, but that is something thai we will have
lo learn from.'"
flic playci s were pleased xviili the win. but
relict led siniilai concerns over not c apitaliz
ing on nianx ol their ollensixe ( bailees.
"I ( LA is a young team, while we are ,i xerx
experienced team." said junior Derek Sliana

han. "I do feel that we played well, but we
seemed lo have trouble converting scoring
( bailees. All in all. I think that a win like iliat ai
home is nice and important.'"
Friclax s game against Washington did not
end in typical fashion lor the Cardinal. Al
though Stanlbrd would gel on the scoreboard
lii si, with Rvan Nelson gelling his head on <i
loose ball in box at l l .):()f>, the lead would not List
long. I hree minutes later Washington plaxer
/ac 11 kingslex got his loot on a ball that xvas de
llec ted into the box keeping the game lied.
Stanlbrd iiacl its chances vet failed to put
the game axvax in regulation. In the 90 min
utes, the Cardinal out-shot the I Inskies 17-4,
however Stanlbrd tallied onlx three shots
on goal.
In overtime the game was determined In a
Iree kirk outside the box. flic shot hit the
crossbar before Washington delencler Bryn
Ritc hie headed the ball in off the rebound,
ending I lie game.
I s.iu Iii bclbre and reallx believe that I his is
the hardest leani to plax in the West coast,"
