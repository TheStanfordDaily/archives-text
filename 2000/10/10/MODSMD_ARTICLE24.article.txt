liiion, Stanlbrd men's water polo
head coach Dante Deltainanti
figures he niglu he able to count
on his lingers the number of
limes that his team has stored
less than 10 goals in a game.
I'nlortifnaleh lor the Cardi
nal, six <1 those lingers were
added just this season and two
came in losses ibis weekend at
Avery Aquatic (lenter. I he hard
luck (Cardinal ((>-. r >, I Mountain

plenty of defensive tricks. but
couldn't Unci any offensive
magic, losing a heartbreaker t < >
No. 9 Pacific on Saturday, 8-7,
then falling to lilth-ranked I (
Irvine on Sunday.
The Tigers (4-S. 1-4) came to
the Farm with vengeance on
their minds. In two meetings al
ready mis season, the Cardinal
had upended Pacific. Only last
weekend, Stanlbrd trounced the
Tigerj at their home pool in

Stockton, claiming a ( .)-7 non
league victory. Now, with both
teams conlerence records on the
line, Pacific came into the
matchup determined to prevent
a ('.ardinal hat 11 i< k.
However, Stanford's inability
to find the bat k of the net helped
put Pacific on track to tally the
victory. Though Stanlbrd saw
eight extra-man situations, h was
only able to capitalize twice. I lie
team's 25 percent power-play
conversion for the game dips
well below its usual .'if> percent.
Though Stanford used its bal
anced scoring attack to sun on top
ol the board most of the game, ac
cording to I )ettamanti, the team is
in need of someone to step up and
take control of the oflense.
"We're a pretty young team,"
Deltainanti said. "Last year we
graduated live out of seven
starters, and the year before that,
we lost four of our seven starters.
We've graduated a lot of our
leading scorers, and we haven't
picked tip the slack."
"When you don't score a lot,
there are mistakes. I here's never

been a perfect water polo game,
that's the nature ol spoils. II
you're storing, vou can afford
mistakes. When you're not stor
ing <i lot ol goals, you < an t aflbrtl
that margin of error."
I wo of the Cardinal's points
against Pacific came from first
year player Jeff Cuyman, a
sophomore who saw action last
year on the ('.ardinal men's
swimming squad. (>uymau's latc
ganie heroics helped keep Stan
lord in the hunt for the win. I It
answered two Pacific goals in the
third and fourth periods, keep
ing the game tied.
Up until the hist moments ol
play, Sianfbrd and Pacific had
spent the majority ol the game
trading goals. The Cardinal hatl
plenty ol opportunities to pull
away, but its poor shooting kept
the game close. Sophomore
Peter lludnut scored twice lor
Sianfbrd. and senior Peter ()s
-born, junior Fodd Snider and
sophomore Brian Darrow each
contributed a goal.

Sophomore Brian Darrow aims to slam the ball into the elusive UC-lrvine goal this weekend. After two losses this
weekend, the Stanford men need to improve their record to have any shot at the national championship.
In the end, however, ii was a
(juesiional)le whistle and an ille

by a I'at ilie defender, who
grabbed Xesmith's head, Nank

ued on Sunday, when the team
took the pool against I (.-Irvine
(<S-S) in non-league play. I he

stvle, and the two squads boasted
solid team defense and dazzling

game, while Irvine's Dan Hipp
notched 15.
According to Dettamanti, the
match was an exceptionally clean
one, and this time the referees did
not seem to interfere in the- out
come. There were notably few
penalties. onl\ one per team,
compared to at least 13 on the
Cardinal the previous day,
though each team missed its one
charity toss.
Stanford and Irvine traded
scoring opportunities, chasing
one another back and forth clown
the pool. Because substitutions
cannot be made until a goal is
scored, the tired Cadinal starling
squad was almost entirely subbed
out in the second quarter. Irvine
saw its opportunity and put itself
on the board with two goals in the
quarter.
Darrow and lludnut broke
Stanford's scoring silence in the
third quarter. Darrow jammed the
ball through I lipp's arms after col
lecting Snider's rebound to tie the
game at 3-3 heading into the

final period.
The fourth quarter wasn't lucky
for Stanford. Irvine scored twice
early to put itself on top, 5-3, and
the Cardinal, unable to answer,
simply ran out of time.
With a 6-5 record overall and a
1-3 record in the conference, time
is also tic king lor Stanford to put
together the kind of record it
would need to knock on the door
of the national championship
tournament. Four teams from
throughout the nation compete
lor the title, including the MPSF
tournament champion and an at
large team decided by its record,
usually the next-best team from
the tough MPSF.
I)cttamanti knows that his team
must win the rest of its games to
challenge the likes of ISC and
UCLA lor the at-large position, or
it will have tocount on playing well
enough in the post-season to cap
ture the MI'SF tournament title.
The team will only be able to
win games if Cardinal arms can
connect with the net.
"We're back to the drawing
boards," Dettamanti said. "We
have a tough game ahead of us
against UCIA on Sunday. This
week we're going to be working on
our shooting and our passing."

Cardinal the previous day,
though each team missed its one
charity toss.
Stanford and Irvine traded
scoring opportunities, chasing
one another back and forth clown
the pool. Because substitutions
cannot be made until a goal is
scored, the tired Cadinal starling
squad was almost entirely subbed
out in the second quarter. Irvine
saw its opportunity and put itself
on the board with two goals in the
quarter.
Darrow and lludnut broke
Stanford's scoring silence in the
third quarter. Darrow jammed the
ball through I lipp's arms after col
lecting Snider's rebound to tie the
game at 3-3 heading into the

final period.
The fourth quarter wasn't lucky
for Stanford. Irvine scored twice
early to put itself on top, 5-3, and
the Cardinal, unable to answer,
simply ran out of time.
With a 6-5 record overall and a
1-3 record in the conference, time
is also tic king lor Stanford to put
together the kind of record it
would need to knock on the door
of the national championship
tournament. Four teams from
throughout the nation compete
lor the title, including the MPSF
tournament champion and an at
large team decided by its record,
usually the next-best team from
the tough MPSF.
I)cttamanti knows that his team
must win the rest of its games to
challenge the likes of ISC and
UCLA lor the at-large position, or
it will have tocount on playing well
enough in the post-season to cap
ture the MI'SF tournament title.
The team will only be able to
win games if Cardinal arms can
connect with the net.
"We're back to the drawing
boards," Dettamanti said. "We
have a tough game ahead of us
against UCIA on Sunday. This
week we're going to be working on
our shooting and our passing."
()fthe b())-plus limes his learn
has taken to I he pool lor tompe
liiion, Stanlbrd men's water polo
head coach Dante Deltainanti
figures he niglu he able to count
on his lingers the number of
limes that his team has stored
less than 10 goals in a game.
I'nlortifnaleh lor the Cardi
nal, six <1 those lingers were
added just this season and two
came in losses ibis weekend at
Avery Aquatic (lenter. I he hard
luck (Cardinal ((>-. r >, I Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) had
plenty of defensive tricks. but
couldn't Unci any offensive
magic, losing a heartbreaker t < >
No. 9 Pacific on Saturday, 8-7,
then falling to lilth-ranked I (
Irvine on Sunday.
The Tigers (4-S. 1-4) came to
the Farm with vengeance on
their minds. In two meetings al
ready mis season, the Cardinal
had upended Pacific. Only last
weekend, Stanlbrd trounced the
Tigerj at their home pool in

Stockton, claiming a ( .)-7 non
league victory. Now, with both
teams conlerence records on the
line, Pacific came into the
matchup determined to prevent
a ('.ardinal hat 11 i< k.
However, Stanford's inability
to find the bat k of the net helped
put Pacific on track to tally the
victory. Though Stanlbrd saw
eight extra-man situations, h was
only able to capitalize twice. I lie
team's 25 percent power-play
conversion for the game dips
well below its usual .'if> percent.
Though Stanford used its bal
anced scoring attack to sun on top
ol the board most of the game, ac
cording to I )ettamanti, the team is
in need of someone to step up and
take control of the oflense.
"We're a pretty young team,"
Deltainanti said. "Last year we
graduated live out of seven
starters, and the year before that,
we lost four of our seven starters.
We've graduated a lot of our
leading scorers, and we haven't
picked tip the slack."
"When you don't score a lot,
there are mistakes. I here's never

been a perfect water polo game,
that's the nature ol spoils. II
you're storing, vou can afford
mistakes. When you're not stor
ing <i lot ol goals, you < an t aflbrtl
