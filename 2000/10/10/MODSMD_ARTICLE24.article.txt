()fthe b())-plus limes his learn
has taken to I he pool lor tompe
liiion, Stanlbrd men's water polo
head coach Dante Deltainanti
figures he niglu he able to count
on his lingers the number of
limes that his team has stored
less than 10 goals in a game.
I'nlortifnaleh lor the Cardi
nal, six <1 those lingers were
added just this season and two
came in losses ibis weekend at
Avery Aquatic (lenter. I he hard
luck (Cardinal ((>-. r >, I Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) had
plenty of defensive tricks. but
couldn't Unci any offensive
magic, losing a heartbreaker t < >
No. 9 Pacific on Saturday, 8-7,
then falling to lilth-ranked I (
Irvine on Sunday.
The Tigers (4-S. 1-4) came to
the Farm with vengeance on
their minds. In two meetings al
ready mis season, the Cardinal
had upended Pacific. Only last
weekend, Stanlbrd trounced the
Tigerj at their home pool in

Stockton, claiming a ( .)-7 non
league victory. Now, with both
teams conlerence records on the
line, Pacific came into the
matchup determined to prevent
a ('.ardinal hat 11 i< k.
However, Stanford's inability
to find the bat k of the net helped
put Pacific on track to tally the
victory. Though Stanlbrd saw
eight extra-man situations, h was
only able to capitalize twice. I lie
team's 25 percent power-play
conversion for the game dips
well below its usual .'if> percent.
Though Stanford used its bal
anced scoring attack to sun on top
ol the board most of the game, ac
cording to I )ettamanti, the team is
in need of someone to step up and
take control of the oflense.
"We're a pretty young team,"
Deltainanti said. "Last year we
graduated live out of seven
starters, and the year before that,
we lost four of our seven starters.
We've graduated a lot of our
leading scorers, and we haven't
picked tip the slack."
"When you don't score a lot,
there are mistakes. I here's never

been a perfect water polo game,
that's the nature ol spoils. II
you're storing, vou can afford
mistakes. When you're not stor
ing <i lot ol goals, you < an t aflbrtl
that margin of error."
I wo of the Cardinal's points
against Pacific came from first
year player Jeff Cuyman, a
sophomore who saw action last
year on the ('.ardinal men's
swimming squad. (>uymau's latc
ganie heroics helped keep Stan
lord in the hunt for the win. I It
answered two Pacific goals in the
third and fourth periods, keep
ing the game tied.
Up until the hist moments ol
play, Sianfbrd and Pacific had
spent the majority ol the game
trading goals. The Cardinal hatl
plenty ol opportunities to pull
away, but its poor shooting kept
the game close. Sophomore
Peter lludnut scored twice lor
Sianfbrd. and senior Peter ()s
-born, junior Fodd Snider and
sophomore Brian Darrow each
contributed a goal.
