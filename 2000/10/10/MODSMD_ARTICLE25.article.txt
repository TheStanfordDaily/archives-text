The Cardinal's performance
against Washington State basically
was a continuation of the history
between the teams. For the fourth
time in live years, the Cardinal beat
the Cougars 1-0 in overtime play.
"It is not an easy game," Nelson
said. "Washington State is always
hard lor any team to beat."
Alter muscling through a dead
even battle for 90 minutes of regu
lation play, Stanford and the
Cougars appeared to be dead
locked. The shot balance stood
nearly even, 19-18, with Washing
ton State leading the way.
Throughout the first 15-
minute overtime the Cougars
seemed to have the advantage.
They recorded seven shots to
Stanford's two, however, as in reg
ulation, neither team managed to
find the back of the net and end
the struggle.
As the teams moved into the
second overtime, momentum
shifted to the Cardinal offense,
which quickly racked up five shots
in the first five minutes, while pre
venting the Cougars from getting
any looks at the Stanford goal.
Finally, with just under live
minutes remaining in the over
time period, sophomore Becky
Myers scored on a header off
Ward's free kick from the right
corner of the field, bringing an
end to over 115 minutes of play.
The assist brought Ward's tally
to 11 on the season, making her
the Pac-10 conference leader in as
sists entering the second week of
play.
Senior goalkeeper Carly Smo
lak also engaged in record break
ing play of her own. Smolak
recorded 10 saves on the week
end, rising to second on the list of
Stanford's all-time career saves
with 200.
Next weekend, the Cardinal
continues Pac-10 play, facing the
California Bears at Berkeley.
