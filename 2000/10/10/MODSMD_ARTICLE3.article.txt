# Unofficial guide debuts

### KATE NAUNHEIM 
"What you hold in your hands
is a piece of history," reads the
dedication oft he first-ever edition
of the "Unofficial Cuide to Stan
ford."
Although similar to the other
Stanford Directory publications
in appearance, the Cuide is ac tu
ally a completely revamped ver
sion of the "Mini-Pages."
A cursory flip through the
Cuide will show any reader that
this book is i*> longer the collec
tion of Pizza-A-Co-Co coupons
that it was merely a year ago. The
Cuide is instead a new breed of
Mini-Pages, commenting on top
ics such as Farm I listory. Campus
I lousing and Employment.
Sidney Wilberforce, one of the
Cuide Project Managers, ex
plained that the Stanford Student
Enterprises, which produces the
Cuide, developed the idea to
change the nature of the precur
sor to the larger Directory. It was


JOY LtE/The Stanford Daily
then up to him and the Directory
staff to carry it out.
"Essentially, we wanted to put
out a book that was comprehen
sive," Wilberforce said.
Bewildered students can pe
ruse sections such as the "Real
World," which oilers helpful ca
reer tips on how to write a cover
letter, put together a resume and
approach an interview so as not to
look like a total bufToon.
The restaurant review sections,
divided into local and San Francis

co restaurants, seem to give a stu
dent's impression of the establish
ments and are tagged with infor
mation boxes showing hours and
relative pricing.
The Guide also goes beyond the
usual call of duty: pictures, graph
its and ( harts serve as visual rein
forcers, illustrating everything
from "Bay Area Radio Stations" to
"(Contraceptives Demystified."
But perhaps one of the most
exciting features of the new
Guide is its reliance on student
input and opinions. For exam
ple, it was produced entirely by
Stanford students. This might
explain the almost uncanny fa
miliarity the authors have with

the inner workings of Mirrielees
and Kimball and the no-non
sense method proposed for re
viewing restaurants.
The Guide also welcomes addi
tional commentary from students.
Scot Strube, director of the Guide,
stresses that the idea is to "gener
ate online student interaction"
through submitting reviews and
responses on the Web site
http://my.stanford.edu.
Student reaction seems to be
very encouraging. Many said they
find the sections on housing par
ticularly engaging.
"I liked reading the entries on
the dorms and their reputations,"
s.iid sophomore Raquel Kennon.a

resident of Twain.
The opinions in the housing
section are those held by the Direc
tory staff and are not divinely dic
tated.
Several students said they have
been overwhelmed by the amount
of "stuff" that is dropped for them
outside their dorm rooms.
"The 'The Unofficial Guide to
Stanford' was not necessarily
meant to compete with "The Guide
to the Good Life,' (a publication
passed out this past weekend)
which is produced by a private
company independent of the Uni
versity," VVilber"force said.
It is, instead, a production lor
and bv the students, he said.
