### ERIN ARCHERD 
Alter 25 years of providing free
worship lor I he Jewish community
beyond the University, llillel, a
campus Jewish student organiza
tion,. now requires a $ 1 SO per per
son contribution in order to attend
High Holiday services of Rosh
Ilashanah, the Jewish New Year,
and Yom Kippur, the Day of
Atonement.
Stanford students and faculty,
however, still attend the services
for free and are allowed to bring
one guest 112 ree of charge.
Rosh Ilashanah and Yom Kip
pur are two of the most important
holidays within the Jewish year

and are marked as a time to cele
brate and relied as a community.
Some Stanford teachers can
celed dass yesterday in honor of
Yom Kippur, a day din ing which
many Jews last. Millel sponsored
several different services, both lib
eral and conservative, throughout
the day.
The new policy has caused
some controversy.
"They have enough trouble
getting people to come," said a
freshman who wished to remain
anonymous. " The idea is to en
courage people to take part in the
Jewish community. They should
encourage people to make dona
tions, but not require it to enter."
Another freshman who asked
not to be identified had reserva
tions about the new policy.
"1 was going to invite my broth
er and bis wife [to services], but
now I'm not so sure," she said.
Many Jews that attend Hillel

services are new to the area and
have not yet found a regular tem
ple.
In a statement on the organiza
tion's Web site, Robert M. Rosen
/weig, president of the Hillel
Foundation at Stanford, ad
dressed concerns that members of
the surrounding community
would be unable to find .1 place of
worship for the High Holidays.
"All who wish to attend High
1 loliday services can find a place to
do so," Rosen/wig stated. "We at
Hillel will continue to welcome as
many members of the wider com
munity as we can accommodate/'
Paying to attend worship ser
vices is not uncommon within the
American Jewish community.
Many synagogues charge non
members for seats and some have
special prices lor select seating
near the altar.
