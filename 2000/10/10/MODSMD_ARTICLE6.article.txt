### KATHERINE LEMONS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
One of Political Science Prof, doit
Marker's top advisees is running for
president ol the United States.
Blacker, the acting director of the In
stitute lor International Studies, dou
bles as one of Vice President A1 Gore's
top advisers on foreign policy. He co
chairs Gore's Russia advisory group.
In preparation for the Oct. 3 presi
dential debate. Blacker said he "had to
come up with the five most likely lines of
attack on Russia issues and defense
points."
Blacker said the vice president has

extensive experience
in dealing with for
eign affairs, so "[he]
does not sit at a table
with ten people
around him and ask
them to tell him what
he thinks or should
think.
I am a life-long
Democrat," Blacker

said about his own political decision to
support and work for Gore in his presi
dential campaign. "My objective is to
elect the kind of Democrat I want to see
in office."
Gore's campaign employs foreign

policy groups that locus on Kasl Asia,
Russia, defense and arms control,
among other issues. Kxperts in each
field are responsible lo the vice presi
dent lor providing speech ideas, talking
points oil important issues and debate
preparation. These advisers also partic
ipate in strategy sessions.
Political Science Prof. Condoleez/a
Rice, former Stanford provost, is 1 exas
Governor George YV. Bush's foreign af
fairs adviser and a < lose friend of Slack
er's.
"(Rice's) task with the governor now
is very different from mv job with

Prof. Blocker
Gore," he added. "Not because
one is smart and one is less so. but
because the vice president is more
experienced with foreign affairs
issues."
Blacker is not a newcomer to
the national political scene. In
1982-83, he served as a legislative
assistant to Sen. Gary Hart (D) of
Golorado. In 19K4 he served as
the chairman of Hart's foreign
policy advisory group in the sena
tor's bid for t lie presidency.
Blacker first met the foreign
policy contingent of the Democ -
ratic Party when he accompanied
Hart to the Democratic (Conven
tion that year. Beginning in 1994,
Blacker advised the Clinton ad
ministration on Ukrainian and
Russian affairs.
Election issues
After eight years of Democratic
leadership and economic growth.
Blacker believes the Democratic
Party deserves to be re-elected.
"I have much more faith in the
commitment of the Democratic
Party to act on equity issues,"

Blacker said.
He also believes that the New
Democrats prioritize social justice,
equity and responsibility, both fis
cal and personal. Blacker notes the
disparities in the foreign policy
agendas of the two competing par
ties.
"The distinction is between
leaning forward and leaning
back," Blacker explained, em
ploying a favorite metaphor.
"Gore believes in forward en
gagement — in identifying prob
lems early on — dealing with
them c lose to the source and ap
plying the requisite resources to
them."
The Republican Party, Blacker
said, is more reserved.
"They are calling for pulling
back a bit. They are being more
careful about the use of force."
"I think they are being very
simplistic," Blacker said. "They
have not served in government
since the end of the Cold War.
Foreign policy these days is very
messy."
Back to the Farm
Blacker described his time at
the White House as simultane
ously gi ueling, rewarding and in
spiring. It also forced him to give

up his research on Russian for
eign and defense politics.
With the end of Clinton's first
term in office, Blacker returned
to his post as a professor and re
searcher at Stanford.
He has always stood with one
loot in academia and one foot in
polity making. Operating out of
an institution reputed to have one
of the best programs in interna
tional relations in the United
States, Blacker cannot help but
question the relationships be
tween the two facets of his work
ing life.
"There is a divide between
those who are more theoretically
inclined and [those who are]
more practically inclined," Black
er said. "I want my research to
stand alone, that is how I try to
teach, but 1 try to apply it in poli
cy work."
"()f the ideas that go on in the
academy, 95 percent never
leave," Blacker said.
1 here are academics who ven
ture out to advise policy makers
and to make policy themselves,
but they are few and far between,
Blacker said. Politicians, especial
ly those occupying the highest po
litical olfices in the country, rely
heavily on these go-betweens to
inlbrm and clarify their decisions,

he said.
More interestingly, Blacker
found, are politicians who "cher
ry-pick back into the academy"
when they need to fortify unpop
ular policy decisions.
Should Gore win the election
in November, Blacker is not cer
tain he will once again leave Stan
ford for Washington, D.G.
"I have no ambitions to go back
to Washington at this point and 1
honestly do not know how I
would respond [if asked to
serve]," he said. "I had the honor
of being asked and the privilege
of serving [in the Clinton admin
istration), but it was difficult work.
"1 do believe deeply in the im
portance of national service."
Blacker added. "This govern
ment functions because people
give ol themselves."
Blacker likens the constant
movement of people from out
side the political realm into gov
ernmental roles to having a
bunch ol uninvited relatives
come fora visit.
"It keeps the permanent peo
ple from feeling that the govern
ment is their possession, which
it is not," Blacker said. "As long
as public: service continues, this
will continue to be a great place
to live."
