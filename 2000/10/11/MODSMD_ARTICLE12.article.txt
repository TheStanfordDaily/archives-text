1991
On October 11, 1991, The Daily pub
lished an article called "Soto note says lie's
alive, well."
"The residents of Solo are resting a little
bit easier now alter having received word
of their dog-sialue 'Soto, which disap
peared from the dorm almost two weeks
ago.
"Actually, they received word from him.
" 'Soto' wrote a letter earlier this week to
the residents in which he claimed that I hey
treated him like a worthless lump ol
stone,' and he has therefore taken oil to
see the world.
"Among his numerous complaints,
'Soto' cited the fact that he has been
robbed of his freedom, has never been fed,
never been walked and has 'needed to find
a lire hydrant for the last .SO years.'...
"Included with the letter was a picture
of'Soto' sitting under the Interstate 2NO
sign on Sand I lill Road, where he said he
began his journey."
Bottom line: Even dorm stone mascots might
need to stop out fora while.
