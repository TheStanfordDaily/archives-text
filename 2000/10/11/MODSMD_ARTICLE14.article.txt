## Bush cheered by polls; needling continues on both sides

BLOUNTVILLE, Tenn. (AP) —
Republican George W. Bush invaded Al
(lore's turf on yesterday, taunting that his
Democratic rival "used to live here" and
was now "ol Washington, lor Washington
and by Washington."
I he Texas governor, cheered by polls
showing the rate a dead heat in Ten
nessee, suggested he would win the vice
president's home state.
" 1 he people ol this great state are
going to bind together and they're going
to send a cleat message to America, Bush
told several thousand supporters at an air
port rally in staunchly Republican eastern
Tennessee.
Bush also welcomed Gore's decision to
dispatch tunning mate Joseph Lieberman
on what the Democratic ticket was billing
as a "failed leadership tour of Texas" to
bash Bush's record as governor.
"Come on down," Bush said. "We wel
come the talk, about the Texas record."
He depicted Texas as a state where
Republicans and Democrats had worked
together to improve educational opportu
nities overhaul welfare programs and
attract new business investment. The
Gore campaign criticizes Bush lor over
seeing a state with pollution and health
care problems.
Bush stopped here for several hours
on his way from Austin, Texas, to (Jreens
boro, N.C., which he will use as a base lor
todav s second debate with Gore at Wake
Forest University in nearby Winston-
Salem.
In Greensboro, Bush depicted his
Democratic opponents as "voices from the
past. One thing that's certain: they can't

get the job done."
Bush, who has been hav ing problems
with syntax and explaining details of his
own programs, stumbled several limes at
the North Carolina event.
At one point, he suggested that ('.ore's
tax package would vastly complicate the
tax code, requiring the hiring of "numer
ous IRA agents." lie meant IRS— Inter
nal Revenue Service — agents.
At another point, Bush stumbled over
the name ol North Carolina GOP guber
natorial candidate Richard Vinroot and
told the crowd, "Our priorities is our
faith."
Democ rats have accused Bush of being
unable to speak coherently. I lis support
ers argue his jumbled svntax occurs only
occasionally, and usually when he's tired,
and that it's not as serious a problem as
(lore's exaggerations.
The governor spent Sunday and Mon
day practicing lor the next face-oil on his
ranch in central Texas, and also planned
further preparations in North Carolina,
said communications director Karen
I lughes.
Hughes told reporters that Bush did
not intend to directly go after what Gore
foes see as his tendency to exaggerate and
embellish facts.
" The vice president does a pretty good
job of doing that himself," Hughes said.
She also said that, in spending the past
few davs poking fun of Bush's speaking
technic)ties and fumbles, Democrats had
helped lower debate expectations for
Bush. "If you listen to them . . . he can
barely put a sentence together," Hughes
said.

During the most recent round of
debate preparations, Bush spent more
time boning up on foreign policy issues
than he had lor the first debate, Hughes
said. This was partly driven by recent
upheavals in both Yugoslavia and the
Middle East, she suggested.
Bush spoke in a crowded airport
hangar adorned with banners that said "A
Gore-Free Tennessee" and " Tennessee is
Bush Country" and was introduced by
country singer Hank Williams Jr.
He was also joined by several south
ern Democrats who are supporting his
campaign: Grillin Bell, who was Presi
dent Cartel 's attorney general; and Bob
Crawford, Tlorida's Commissioner of
Agriculture.
Although Tennessee was initially
viewed by both parties as likely to go
Democratic, recent polls suggest that
Bush lias drawn even with Gore and that
the race here is now a statistical dead heat.
"1 know I'm not supposed to carry
(Tennessee). They tell me, you know,
Tennessee's all wrapped up. After all, the
man used to live here. I le used to call this
stale home," Bush said. "But ii seems like
ii was so long in the distant past that he
lorgol to trust the people ol Tennessee."
Gore was "of Washington, lor Washing
ton and by Washington,"he said.
First elected to Congress in 197f>, Gore
has spent many of his years in Washing
ion, both as the c hild of a senator and as a
politician.
Earlier in ihe campaign, in <111 eflort to
reallirm 11 is Tennessee lies, Gore moved
his campaign headquarters from Wash
ington, D.C., to Nashville.

Bush, using a needling tone, told sup
porters: " Tennessee's a line place to live.
It depends, I guess, on who your land
lord is."
The c rowd howled at Bush's dear rel

erence to a Carthage, Tenn., family who
had rented a run-down home from Gore
— within view of the Gore family farm —
but complained thai he failed to make
repairs.
