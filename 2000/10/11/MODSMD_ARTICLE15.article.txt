# Nazareth, a town divided
## 
### 
NAXARK I 11, Israel (AP) —By day, Jews and
Arabs here live intertwined lives, sharing jobs,
six >|)s. \ isils in the [).ii k
But by night they are worlds apart: Jews return
to the red-roofed homes and broad streets of
I pper Nazareth, Arabs to the narrow streets of the
old <it\ of Nazareth, scattershot with steeples,
minarets and multi-family homes.
The fragile balance of intimacy and separation
in the town of Jesus' boyhood has now turned vio
lent, after the fire started among Palestinians in
the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem on
Sept. 2N spread here quickly and with unprece
dented fury.
112 irst Israel's Arab citizens took to the streets to
protest their own claims of discrimination and dis
enfranchisement.
On Sunday night, 500 |ews from Upper
Nazareth took the fury back, crossing the 15 yards
of blacktop that separate the two towns, armed
with stones, torches and curses. From mosque
loudspeakers, the cry went out for help: Arab
vouths responded in kind, and police used tear gas
and rubber bullets to separate the sides.

IK Monday morning, the smoke ol burned-out
cars had cleared, and two young Aral) men were
borne in c'ollifts to a i ettiefery tucked into a hill
side, the ninth and tenth Israeli Arabs to die since
the violence began. I heir mourners promised to
redeem their blood.
Yesterday, black flags fluttered over Nazareth
during a three-day protest strike, and echoes tat
tled off the storefronts of the I pper Nazareth
mall, usually busy with Arab shoppers.
Some of the I'pper Nazareth Jews longed for
the limited contact they had just clays ago.
"There was never any trust between us, but we
lived together," said Riki I o\, who sells lottery
tickets in the mall. "There is no other way. We
aren't leaving and neither are they, so we must
find a way to live together as we did before."
Down the road, standing on a Nazareth street
corner where black flags shared a pole with left
over Christmas decorations, 24-year-old Ashraf
Asharil shared the sentiment.
" 1 here is a great sadness here. I lie ties between
our peoples must improve, because the two towns
are one inside the other," he said.

Palestinian police direct Palestinian workers inside the courtyard of Joseph's Tomb, whose dome was paint
ed green today, as reconstruction work got underway in the West bank city of Nablus. The religious shrine
was ransacked last Saturday by Palestinians just after Israeli soldiers evacuated the site. After the Palestinian
destruction of the site some Arab mosques were ransacked by Jews. The Palestinian Authority said Joseph's
Tomb would be rebuilt.
