DETROIT (Al') â€” Green
Party presidential hopeful Ralph
Nader criticized the auto indus
try on us own turf yesterday, t ail
ing the Firestone lire recall "a
classic cover-up" and saying
automakers were lax in pushing
to improve vehicle safety nd fuel
efficiency.
The longtime consumer cru
sader also said federal traflic sale
ty officials have become "consul
tants" who need greater power to
charge corporate "fat cats" who
knowingly allow defective prod
ucts to slav on I he market.
"We really have to have a little
equity in law and order apply to
the rich and powerful,' Nader
told the Economic Club of
1 )etroit.
He accused Ford Motor Co.
and Bridgestone/ Firestone Inc.
of a cover-up over "inherently
unstable" Ford Explorers and the
Firestone tires supplied wilh them
that have been linked to 101
deaths in the United States and
more than 50 overseas.
"I think we really ought to raise
our expectations really high in
accordance with what this indus
try can do when it's put under
pressure" of federal regulation.

Nader said.
Ford has defended the Explor
er's safetv and said it acted as soon
as it learned of a problem with the
Firestone tires.
Messages for comment left yester
day wilh Ford and Firestone were
not immediately returned.
Noting his I{)(>") book "Unsafe
at Any Speed" that criticized
automakers for putting profits
ahead of safety, Nader opened
vesterday by joking that "invita
tions to the Detroit Economic
Club do not come frequently to
me, for obvious reasons."
He then accused auto industry
lobbyists of behind-the-scenes
blitzing to scuttle congressional
pushes for government reform as
.1 result ol the rec all of 0.5 million
tires, concerned that lawmakers
will rush to criminalize dec isions
auto executives make about their
pre xlucts.
Automakers contend that com
pany officials will be less willing to
cooperate wilh government inves
tigators ii the information they
share could be used to charge
them with a crime. 1 lie industry
also argues that language allow
ing punishment fora known
"defect" is too vague.
