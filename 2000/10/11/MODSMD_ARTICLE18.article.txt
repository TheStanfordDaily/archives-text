## The
						Stanford Daily Tiger salamander: poster animal for campus activism 
### 
Published Since IS 1 )I

The salamanders are lobbying once
again. Much as they did with the
bonfire at Lake Lag in 1994 and
with the parking spaces behind The
Suites in 1990, the small but vociferous tiger
salamander population is opposing (lie
encroachment of their turf vet again.
They may have arrived late on the scene,
but their rights are pre-eminent for many
campus activists. The salamander cause lias in
fact become shorthand for environmental
integrit\ on Stanford lands. I he safetv of these
critters, it is argued, must be considered before
our species-centric developmental desires. We
must put our love for the natural earth before
our industrial expansion.
Few seem to recall that our neighbors the
salamanders appealed on the Stanford scene
long after we humans did — and entirelv as a

result of our environmental tampering. The
salamanders came to reside in man-made
Lake Lag, drawn by tfie seasonal fluctuation of
the water level, which seemed to suit their
preferences.
After a few years of uncomfortable aridity,
however, they complained that the natural
drying of the lake in the spring was causing a
disturbance to their childhood development.
Facilities has since kept the water level up in
spring in order to pacify the anxious parents.
After all, the University has a long-standing
tradition of catering to alien species. The
$30,000 spent on every palm tree on campus
is enough to make any salamander resentful.
And, lest we forget, this institution began as a
farm, complete with all the necessary intro
ductions of domestic animals foreign to the
land.

One of the most powerful interest groups
on campus, the tiger salamanders are not to be
outdone by fresh flora appearing every few
weeks either. Compared to these young
upstarts, the salamanders have seniority.
()f course, one understands the difficulty of
finding housing in the area. Increasing gentri
fication drives prices up beyond what all but
the wealthiest of salamanders can afford. The
University's attempts to provide enclaves in
the Foothills have been met with disdain by the
amphibian residents. As a potentially endan
gered species, they won't be told where to go.
(This is to say nothing of the terrible prob
lem of underrepresentation of our small
friends. Who's ever seen a tiger salamander
anyway?)
The campus continues to grow and develop
in response to the needs of students, faculty

and staff, causing irreversible effects to the
environment. No one knows what native
species have been driven out by the transplan
tation of all its alien imports.
A number of other equally threatened
species have received far less press and applied
far less pressure to University planning. But
the tiger salamanders will be darned if their
cute species is going to get squished, burned or
cramped by our human interests.
It's unfortunate that they don't seem to real
ize how many other species and factions would
benefit from their example. Sadly, "J ust i ce for
Salamanders," however worthy a cause,
detracts from the larger picture — namely, one
in which activism doesn't need a mascot, but a
network.
It could be that all the publicity has gone to
their heads.
