						Ego has landed 
### MICHAEL TOTH STAFF COLUMNIST 
I'sssssssss pssss pssss. You can hear it
from the farthest corner off nc le Iceland's
Farm, that terrible hissing sound: the
deflation of the "Stanford Fgo."
Hie past lew months have not been
eas\ on the Farm. 1 he dot.com cra/.e has
spawnedthedot.com Death Watch. At last
sighting, that insufferable dormmate of
yours who dropped out last winter and bv
Spring Break had enough stock options to
purchase <t small island, is on the corner of
I ni\et sit \ Ave. holding a c ardboard sign
that reads, "Hey brother, can you spare
me a hazelnut frapalatte?"
I he met get of the University of Sati
Francisco and Stanford hospitals has con
tinued to be anything but hospitable. I he
hospitals incut red $43 million in losses
this summer, adding to the $(>() million
they had alreadv lost bv 1998.
Along the wav Stanford got a new pres
ident, though the Farm, ever obedient,
never questioned whether the change in
administration had anvthing to do with
the merger fiasco. I his columnist plans to
plav right along, but he'll add some advice
for the new president: a million here and
a million there, prettv soon you're talking
about real money.
I he real Whopper came in the form of
a list — the I .S. News and World Report
ranking of Americ an universities. I he
senseless survex that nevertheless turns
heads, placed Stanford sixth, behind four
east coast schools .is well as instate rival ('.al
Tech.
I he Faun was soon abuzz. Naturally,
no one confessed to reading the U.S.
News ranking, but si ill everyone had
heard the news. Along with each lament
that Stanford was not number one came
the assumption that there was a culprit.
Just who? Listen closeh and you'll hear it
said, "It's the jocks."
It is true Stanford takes its sports seri
ously. In the same week that Stanford's
football team somersaulted over national
ly-tanked Texas, its swimmers were busy
rac king up more Olvmpic gold than sev
eral industrialized nations. Ii is also true
the universities that outranked Stanford
on the U.S. News c harts are not generally
considered athletic powerhouses.
From tennis to track, M.I. 112. is just not
in Stanford's league. Furthermore, it is
true Stanford's scholarship athletes enter
the Farm with standardized test scores
that are on average lower than their peers.
In 199H, Stanford's Ibb male scholarship

athletes averaged a 1222 SAT score, while
iis 120 female scholarship athletes aver
aged a 1213. Kadi score is an estimated
1.10 points lower than the average Stan
lord student's tally.
I am firmly against the"I niversit)-Ath
letic Complex" — the transformation of
simple games into professionally pack
aged, corporate sponsored advertise
ments for the I niversity. For this com
plex, I blame not the Athletic Department,
and certainly not its athletes, but rather
the I niversity.
lhe prof essionali/at ion of universitv
sports is a function of a larger and uglier
mechanism: the professionalization of the
university. Si vis videre tumulum meum,
circumspice. Political theorv has been
replaced b\ political science, philosophy
In logic and logic by computer program
ming, architecture bv engineering, history
by economics and economics by manage
ment. lhe research institution, mean
while, has replaced the university, with
lecturers giving way to a highly-capable
corps of fact finders, each dedicated to
producing a waterfall of material on a sub
ject microscopic enough to become its
expert.
(Considering these trends, ii should not
surprise anyone the scholar-athlete has
been replaced by the one-sport specialist,
or that college games unfit for television
have withered, while those able to make
national heroes with the toss of ball have
thrived. Where have you gone, varsity
badminton?
I liere is such a thing as a sensible divi
sion of labor. It even exists at this univer
sity. Stanford could not replace its football
team with its soccer team and expect them
to score touchdowns; nor could it replace
its English Department with its Chemistry
Department and expect them to do what
ever it is Knglish professors do these clays.
A degree of specialization is natural in all
things because people are naturally poets.
We tend to clo what we're passionate
about and ignore everything else. Except
universities aren't meant for poets, but
students. Whether it's looking for faculty
or freshmen, Stanford is light to recruit
only one applicant. The one eager to
share ideas. Fortunately loi the Farm,
there are enough of them to more than
fill its classrooms, and even provide a poet
here and there.
He •ar that sound? It's the re-inflation of
the Stanford Ego.
