Student response
I think the primary goal should

be inc t easing standards in the pub
lic school system," said freshman
(lore supporter Bianca Redhead.
"[Vouc hers| are just an attempt to
skirt the issue, which is that public
schools are under performing."
Junior Tolu Thomas agreed.
In the long run, school vouch
ers will hurt the inner-city public
schools," he said. "I don't think
$ I ,r»00 is enough lo help the ones
til,il need il I he most."
freshman Erin Buckley said
she believes thai Bush places 100
much emphasis on testing.
"My cousin goes to a public
school in fexas, and they're
taught lor the lest rather than lor
learning," Buckley said.
While many students con
curred thai the voucher system
would be harmful to public
schools, not all were enthusiastic
about (lore's big-spending plan.
"(lore's plan might gel him
elected, but it won't necessarily
work," said freshman Dave

( .ban, pointing out that the sur
plus (lore is counting on may not
materialize.
"I don't think (lore's plan would
have as much effect as he would
like you to think," said freshman
Dan I i ban, who backs Bush.
Education policies of third-party
candidates
Beyond the students who sup
port either Bush or (lore, there
are those who plan lo vote lor
Green Parly candidate Ralph
Nader. Even some students who
w ant Nader to become Ihe next
president aren't c ertain where he
stands on education.
Some students maintain that
this is the result olunequal media
coverage of the candidates,
while others sav lliev think that
Nader has not done an adequate
job of com munica I i n g Iii s
stances on issues.
According to a statement he
made to SclcclSinart.com, Nader

believes in public education and
thinks that communities need to
work together to improve exist
ing schools.
Stanford students are also not
generally well-informed about Re
form Parly candidate Pal
Buchanan's views on education.
Buchanan proposes to abolish the
lederal Department of Education
in order to preserve state control
over public education.
Whatever candidate they sup
port. most Stanford students seem
to believe that ibis year's election
will have important ramifications
lor education.
Fortunately for those who want
to hear more from the candidates
themselves on the issue, Gore has
promised to "make education the
topic of discussion" in tonight's
debate. Based on the lively dis
course that ihe issue sparks
among Stanford students, il ap
pears that his mission has already
been accomplished.
