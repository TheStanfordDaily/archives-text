Career fair distracts students from more
important issues in life
I lie career fair is when hundreds of
recruiters swarm onto c ampus in hoards
to recruit the precious gem that is a
Stanford student.
I was disgusted by the career fair.
Just to clarify, it is not because I got the
feeling that I would starve when 1 grad
uated. As a mathematical and computa
tional sciences major, I was probably
what all the recruiters wanted. But were
they what I wanted?
First of all, naming the event in
White Plaza a career fair is a slap in the
face of all career fairs, it was a consulting
and engineering head-hunting extrava
ganza.
As Stanford graduates, we will all get
jobs and will not starve, regardless of
major. Our priorities is what 1 am con
cerned about. Is all we garner from this
great institution of education and learn
ing that money is cause of all happiness.
I hope not.
Kurt Cobain once said, "Kveryonc is
drunk, everyone is drunk on junk." I lis
words have never rung so true. We are
all so worried about a six figure salary
upon graduation that we forget about
what really is important.
You're young. You're in your early
20's. Co out and see the world. Explore.
Learn. Be stupid. You, the Stanford stu
dent, unlike the rest of the world has the
opportunity to be free and do whatever
you like. What is the hurry to start the
rest of your life? Your career will be with
you lor the rest of your life. Travel, Vol
unteer, Teach, Work as a ski instuc tor.
When else are you going to have the

opportunity to clo that? When you are
60?
Please, please, whatever you do,
don't become a corporate whore.

Community members speak out on the
upcoming presidential election
Seemingly overlooked in the media
evaluation of I)i< k (-heney is his effect in
sec uring the votes of the extreme right
lor the Republican ticket. The national
press has asked C heney about his con
gressional voting record on issues rang
ing from Mead Start to cop-killer bul
let s. Cheney liberally alters his position
on each controversial vote, except his
vote against a resolution in favor of free
ing Nelson Mandela.
In defending his Mandela vote,
Cheney invokes "communism." Man
dela communist? Hardly — then or
now. Why does Cheney continue deni
grating Nelson Mandela? Because Nel
son Mandela is black! Cheney's stance
reassures and secures the votes of the
bigots and racists of the extreme right.
Cheney creates a buffer between the
extreme right and Bush. Thus, Bush
frees himself to appeal to fiscally conser
vative white middle class voters who
otherwise will not tolerate bigotry. Willi
Cheney, Bush gets the vote of the
extreme right AND finesses the vote of
otherwise sensible, kind conservatives.
The vote of both groups is essential to
his campaign success.
Perhaps the effect of this plan is what

Bush means when he talks about "Soft
Bigotry!" Except, in whose cynical lexi
con is bigotry ever "Soft?" The bigotry
of the Republican party is as masterfully
pernicious and present today as it was in
198N when Bush-the-father invoked
Willie I lorton.
An antic for which Bush-the-father's
campaign adviser (Lee Atwater) later
apologized, but Bush-the-father never.
Like father, like son. The fruit
doesn't fall far from the tree.

A1 Gore still doesn't get it! Again, he
exposes his inherent ignorance and cyn
ical nature.
For example, the California Teach
er's Retirement System, the third largest
public employee plan in the country,
with its $112.7 billion in assets, reported
(6/30/00) a 12.7% annual return on its
investments.
Al Gore's touted old-New-Deal, passe
Social Security plan barely earns 1%. No
wonder informed young people believe
more in flying saucers and that Elvis
lives than believe in the solvency of
Social Security.
Similarly, CALpers, the largest retire
ment system in the public sector invests
00-70% of its funds in corporate securi
ties. Nevertheless, Al Gore claims these
types of retirement plans are "too risky"
for more Americans.
How much longer will Democrats tol
erate outworn socialistic government
programs?
