## Hello, Logan: With Tom back in the fold, volleyball knocks off Cal 
### EZRA CALLAHAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the fans filed into Maples Pavilion
to watch the No. 21 Stanford women's
volleyball team take on California last
night, they bore witness to a very unusu
al sight on the court â€” Logan font, with
her usual number 15 on her back, was
warming up on the Stanford side ol the
court.
Having just returned to campus Fri
day after playing lor the U.S. Olympic
Team in Sydney last month, Tom had
yet to announce whether she would play
for the Cardinal this year. However, as
her name was announced with the Stan
ford starting lineup hist night and she
took to the court to a loud standing ova
tion from the crowd, loin put all ques
tions to rest.
Playing in her first collegiate match
this season, Tom posted a match-high I 7
kills to lead the Cardinal (10-6, 5-4 l'ac il
ic 10 Conference) over a clearly unpre
pared Cal (8-7, 4-5) team, sweeping tlie-
Hears 3-0. The win was the third consec
utive victory lor Stanford and pushed the
team over the .500 mark in conference

play at the halfway point of the season.
Many had speculated that after play
ing with the national team for the past
several months, Tom would opt to take
some time off from volleyball and red
shirt for the- remainder of the season.
However, the All-American outside hit
ter, who recorded one of the most im
pressive freshman vears in NC.W histo
ry last fall, ended all speculation with her
appearance last night.
"1 made the decision [to play] yester
day." said loin. "I figured, I'm going to
go to school here, and if I red-shirt, I'll
just be sitting on my [butt] all day. I'm
not one to sit and watch a game."
