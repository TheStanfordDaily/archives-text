# A 						DREAM RUNS THROUGH HIM
## 
### BETH GERMAN 
Trying to track down (la be Jennings is like
running a race against time. Soon he will be
off to another big event, the hype of the Sum
mer Gamies will be over and he will dun the
door on Sydney.
"After this interview I'm not going to talk
about the 2000 Olympics anymore. I'm going
to talk about right now and my future. And
my dreams," Jennings said.
An ()lytnpic athlete and Stanford standout,
Jennings is an artist with the passion and en
ergy to sculpt those dreams into reality. Dri
ven by drumbeats and a deep inner determi
nation, he competes with himself both on and
off the track. 2000 was a breakout season â€”
he captured the NCAA championships in the
indoor mile and then matched it with the
NCAA title. But his crowning moment came
in June at the U.S. Olympic Trials, where he
topped a strong field to win the 1,500-meter
run, achieving his personal best time of 3 min
utes, 35.90 seconds to earn a spot on the U.S.
team. At the Olympics in September, Jen
nings made it to the semifinal round of the
1,500 before finishing ninth and missing the
final. These accomplishments, though, are
mere building blocks lor his greater goals.
Through the looking glass of Sydney, Jen
nings opened his eyes to wider possibilities lor
the future. Pushing himself to new extremes,
Jennings put on his game lace. Once he ar
rived in Australia, nearly a month belore the
starter's gun would go off, life became a tor
turous waiting game.
"I was like a prisoner inside the Olympic
village with security guards all around. The
village was a ghost town of walking dead. Ath
letes with all this angst and nervous energy.
They weren't) alive. I saw glimpses ol life but
only in competition. I he place reeked ol fear.
You see a lot of people that underachieve at
the Olympics even though they've done all
the right training. When they get there, they
overthink it. I was one of those. But I've

learned from my mistakes and I'm
moving on. This cross-country sea
son and school year, I'm starting
fresh."
Though his event is an individ
ual competition, he leels a greater
calling <>1 camaraderie when he
wins. "I'm not nationalistic and 1
don't like that aspect of the
Olympics. It's about the human
spirit. I respect all of my competi
tors no matter what jersey or color
skin they have or how they run or
look. It's just different people with
different strengths and weaknesses
coming together.
"I don't race well unless I have
that respect," said Jennings. "I
need to tap into the energy level of
my competitors. I need to love
them and race to their level. II
they're younger, less experienced
competitors I hope they will raise it
to mine. We're all trying to reach
our potential."
Now Jennings is back in his

comfort zone at Stanford, the place
he calls home. His track teammates
embrace him as a brother, while
Chi Iheta Chi, the co-op where he
lives, welcomes him as family.
"To us he's just 'Gabe,' " said
track and field co-captain
Jonathon Riley, one of his com
rades from his high school glory
days. "I'm very happy to see his
dreams materialize. Back in high
school he always said he would be
an Olympian. . . . He's always
gone to extremes, even through
injuries, he's always given 100 per
cent."
Jonathan Stevens, another
track teammate, recalled one Pa
cific 10 Conference meet at Ore
gon where Jennings rallied the
Stanford team into a positive zone.
"Gabe got me to buy a tam
bourine." said Stevens. "All of us
had a rhythmic vibe going during
the event." Jennings is known to
orchestrate such cheering sections
and had a large percussion sec tion
of friends and family armed with
drums to keep a cheering beat.
A music major on the Farm, Jen
nings maintains strong ties be

iween his athletic ambitions, acade
mics and campus life. "I'm starting
to recognize the interconnection of
my activities. Drumming is a form
of endurance, as is running."
At the Rhythmic House, as Chi
Theta Chi is known to its resi
dents, music chimes throughout
the Spanish-style villa, while a tri
angle sounds the dinner bell. The
co-op is the perfect place lor Jen
nings. It feeds his soul and spirit.
Doing the dishes in the kitchen,
he started an impromptu band
session, banging on pots and pans
with chopsticks. Soon the kitchen
transformed into a music room as
cheese graters became triangles;
containers, bag pipes; and kettles,
steel drums.
The interview took place while
Jennings relaxed in his favorite
thinking spot, a sweat lodge lie
built himself in the co-op's back
yard. Reminiscent of an upbring
ing filled with music, big dreams
and values, Chi Theta Chi is a
place containing childhood mem
ories, a colorful tire swing, lazy
hammocks and a vegetable gar
den. Tomatoes and mint leaves

picked fresh become part of the
dinner ritual.
Jennings was raised and
home-schooled in a remote re
gion of Northern California
called Forks of Salmon. Crowing
up without modern conveniences
such as television and indoor
plumbing, his family ate what
they grew from the back garden
and generated their own electric
ity using hydroelectric and solar
power. During this time his par
ents instilled values of hard work
and a do-it-yourself mentality in
their oldest child, l eat hers, they
ran a two-room schoolhouse with
35 to 50 pupils drawing from the
200 or so people that lived within
a 100-mile radius ol Klamath Na
tional Forest.
A runner since childhood, Jen
nings related the story of his lirst
taste of competition: "I lost my first
race when 1 was five. We called it a
marathon although it was actually
a mile, a course around my school.
Fora little kid 11 Kit's a long way and
it had a big hill at the end. 1 got
beat. It was that first struggle and
defeat that I turned into a victorv

because it drove me to work hard
er. I started running to school after
that loss. 1 never lost another
marathon. It was called the River
(Mympics; a community of schools
along the Salmon River. That was
my first taste of competition and it
was a true community experience.
It was tli.it community support
and parental support tli.it I loved.
And it stuck with me." Today Jen
nings continues to run that very
same distance.
When he was 13 years old, his
family moved to Wisconsin. "We
ended up in Madison (Wisconsin),
and my dreams came true. . . . It
was the most exciting thing to have
all these organized sports that
Americans take for granted: orga
nized track meets not just once a
year, but even week. I was in heav
en." lie took advantage of the
many resources before him, and it
wasn't long before his natural ath
letic abilities guided him to victory.
As an eighth grader he finished
second at the National Hershey
hack and Field meet in Pennsyl
vania and won nine state titles in
Wisconsin. I lis athletic talents.

combined with strong academics,
earned him a scholarship to Stan
ford in 1997.
Already an accomplished athlete
ai ihe age of 21 . Jennings aspires to
bigger goals. "Right now 1 can see
lhat 1 am the next world record
holder and next Olympic champi
on. ( .all it overzealous confidence
or arrogance, but 1 call it vision."
Sharing the same birthday as leg
endary distance runner Steve Pre
lontaine (January 25th), Jennings
reveals: "Whenever I run in Hay
ward Held, which is the Oregon
track that he ran in, I run under the
rafters and 1 hear his spirit."
Right now he lurks in the shad
ows of !i<) Stanford athletes who
are world record holders, but soon
Jennings wiil be ready to step into
the light. "It lias to start with a
dream, and if you're gonna
dream, dream big. Don't dream
defeat, don't dream nightmares,
otherwise they might come true.
So I'm dreaming right now and
I'm enjoying it. Reaching that
next level will take a lot of hard
work and a beginner's mind. I
have so much to learn."
