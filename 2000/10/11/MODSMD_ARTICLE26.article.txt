Trying to track down (la be Jennings is like
running a race against time. Soon he will be
off to another big event, the hype of the Sum
mer Gamies will be over and he will dun the
door on Sydney.
"After this interview I'm not going to talk
about the 2000 Olympics anymore. I'm going
to talk about right now and my future. And

village with security guards all around. The
village was a ghost town of walking dead. Ath
letes with all this angst and nervous energy.
They weren't) alive. I saw glimpses ol life but
only in competition. I he place reeked ol fear.
You see a lot of people that underachieve at
the Olympics even though they've done all
the right training. When they get there, they
overthink it. I was one of those. But I've
