The Stanford field hockey team fell Monday
to the Towson Tigers in an overtime loss, end
ing a disappointing East ('.oast swing. I he (Car
dinal combined for only one win during the
trip, while developing both offensive and de
fensive problems.
After a 2-0 shutout win over undefeated and
1 Nth-ranked Georgetown (8-1 )on I riday, Stan

lord (5-9 overall, 3-2 Northern Pacific Confer

tional champion No. 1 Maryland (10-1) Sal in -
day afternoon. I he Terrapins proved 100
much for the Cardinal, overwhelming the
squad by an «S-1 score. In its remaining two
games, Stanford suffered overtime losses
against American University (6-5) and lowson
(4-10). Heading back home, the Cardinal will
look lor more solidarity on defense while head

coach Sheryl Johnson attempts to improve its
offensive effectiveness.
Beginning the tour in the nation's capital,
the Cardinal surprised an undefeated and
overconfident Georgetown team In capitaliz
ing early, scoring two goals off penalty corners
during a three-minute interval. Sophomore
midfielder ( hristina Williams scored both noals
oil assists from junior forward
Krica Swesey.

1 he victory marked the fifth
shutout win for the Cardinal, due
largeh to the play of Norl'ac Go-
Defensive player of the month, ju
nior goalie Rebec c a Shapiro.
The (lardinal was unable to sus
tain its momentum as the team
traveled north to Maryland. I he
lerrapitis proved themselves de
serving of their top ranking, over
whelming the- (lardinal both offen
sively .md defensively. While the
Maryland offense was led by tri
captain keli Smith with three as
sists, the team showed its depth as
six different Terrapins combined
for eight goals. Juniors Dina Ri/./.o
and Caroline Walters netted two
apiece.
I he Terrapins outshot the Car
dinal, 27-8, proving once again the
value of Shapiro in goal. Stanford's
offense did not remain completel\
dormant, however, .is sophomore
midfielder Amrit Chima scored
Stanford's lone goal unassisted
early in the lirst half.
I lowevei, jeain members were
not dissuaded by the Cardinal's

our spirits high and played togeth
er until the very end." said sopho
more forward Amanda Billmeyer.
