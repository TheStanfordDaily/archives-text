### ALEX BENJAMIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Rivalries have to start some
where. lot the Stanford men's
soccer team, last year's loss in the
first round of the NCAA Tourna
ment to Santa (Clara served as the
catalyst to.
Last November, the two teams
met in a game that lasted a total of
150 minutes, with 90 minutes ol
regulation and lour 15-minute
overtimes taking the match late
into the night. St ill unable to
break the 2-2 tie at the end two
and.i half hours of play. they went
to ,i shootout â€” which the (Cardi
nal eventually lost f>-5. Tomor
row, Stanford heads to Santa
Clara lot a rematch that the play
ers have been waiting lor ever
since that chilly November night.
"Santa Clara will be a tougher
game then it would appear on
paper," said senior Matt Moses.
"They play a similar style to out s
and therefore understand the
way we play. In the past few
games we have developed quite a
rivalry, so I he emotion and inten

sity will be high."
So far this season the Broncos
have not had a smooth start. Cur
rently Santa Clara stands at an
even 5-5, but two of the team's
losses were against tough teams.
Last week the Broncos lost to No.
.'J San |ose State, while earlier in
the season they lost to No. I I CI.A
I -0 in overtime. Santa (Clara's lone
impressive win came back in Sep
tember, over a Washington team
ih.it handed Stanford its first loss
on Friday.
"They had a lew defeats recent
ly, but tliev won't have given up
on their season," Moses said.
" They will deliniteh look to this
game as a turning point. It will
definitely be a hard game, but
these are the t\pes of games that
good teams win. It is |a gamej with
little to gain but lots to lose.
Santa Clara has made the trip
to the N( '.AA Tournament each of
the last live years, with appear

will have to be in top form for Stanford to top dangerous Santa Clara.
Broncos to continue this pattern with
the loss of seven graduating seniors
from last season, including All-Ameri
cans Eric Denton and Adam Erye.both
of whom now play in Major League
Soccer.
Regardless of the Broncos' history,
Stanford still is left with the task of
stopping a team with very solid play
ers. The three veterans of the team are
seniors Joe Ascolese, Brett Davis and
Micheal Coehring, each of whom
knows what it takes to make it into the
NCAA Tournament.
()n oflense the Cardinal will have to
contain Jamil Walker, the Broncos'
leading scorer, along with Anthony
Chimienti, the team leader in assists
and is second in goals. At the back of
the field Stanford must also look to get

the ball past returning goalkeeper
Rust) Johnson, who made the game
winning save in lasi year's playoff
game against the Cardinal.
"Santa Clara is similar to Washing
ton in that they're big and strong and
they work hard as a team," said senior
Luke Rust. "It's always a fierce compe
tition when they come to town, and
you can be sure that we'll be looking
for revenge after last year's tourna
ment defeat."
With the season now half over, the
Cardinal is silling pretty with a 9-1-1
record and No. 4 and No. 11 rankings
courtesy of Soccer America and the
National Soccer Coaches' Association
of America's polls, respectively. In
eleven games Stanford has out scored
opponents 40-3 with nine shutouts,
while spreading the scoring wealth
with 1 1 players tallying one or more
goals and 15 players one or more as
sists.
Stanford has also subscribed to the

idea of accuracy through volume by
outshooting opponents 214-60. Un
fortunately, other teams have only
been forced to make 7(> saves, a lad
that hurt them iliis past weekend
against Washington in the season's
first loss.
"The good thing is that we are cre
ating chances," said head coach liobb)
('.lark. "II we weren't getting the
chances then I would be worried.'
l he games ahead don't get any eas
ier for the Card, with a match against
No. 2 Indiana and battles with I '('.LA
and Washington again on the road.
Thursday's game against Santa C.lara
is just another one on the list.
"We are looking forward to a battle
for 90 minutes," said senior Scott
Leber. "Santa (llara is a very well orga
nized team that has good team shape,
as well as being very physic al. We have
never had an easy game against Santa
C.lara and Thursday night should be
no exception."
