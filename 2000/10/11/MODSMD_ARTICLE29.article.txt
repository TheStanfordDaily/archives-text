### KATHERINE LEMONS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Indian activist and author
Abha\ Mehta spoke on Sunday
evening to an audience of 40
about the role ol I exas-based
multi-national corporation
Enron in India. 1 lie title of his
i.ilk, held iu the Cates Comput
et Science Building, was "Knron
in India: What they said, What
the\ did."
Mehta was joined by Pratap
( hatterjee, a reporter lor"Democ
rats Now!' and co-host of" ferra
Verde. Both shows air on KPFK
FM 90.7, the B.t\ Area's Radio
Pat ilita station.
1 lie i.ilk was sponsored l>\ the
Stanford Indian Association, the
Asia Pacific Research Center, the
lihli.i Relief and Education Fund
and Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford.
Shalini Cera, one of the chief
organizers of the event, said, "I lie
purpose of the talk is to raise
awareness about India and aware
ness about corporate globaliza
tion .... So far, involvement lias
been cultural, not political."
With 40 percent of Silicon Val
le\ start-up companies owned bv
Indians and Indian-Americans,
the communit\ is rapidly gaining
prestige and economic clout in the
area. Cera hopes that ihev will be
able to harness some of these re
sources to confront issues facing
India.
Enron in India
In 1002, the Dabhol Power
Company struck a ileal with the
slate government ol Maharashtra,
India, to build a natural-gas-based
power station. According to

Mehta, the transaction was both
the largest civilian contract ever to
be signed and the Inst wholly pri
vate power venture in India.
I lie following vear, according
to .in Amnesty International re
port released in July 1007, "a
power purchase agreement was
agreed between the DPC [Dabhol
Power Company! and the Maha
rasira Slate Electriciiv Board lor
the purchase of elect riciiv generat
ed by the project."
Mehta cmphsi/cd the stale of
this project: "Within 72 hours, the
stale electricity board had signed
an agreement lor the single largest
purchase ever, valued at roughly
$:r>.4 billion, he said.
I'he contract ensures thai the
board will purchase power only
from Dabhol, whose rate is 1
cents per unit, a 0-cent-pei-unit
increase over the -I cents per unit
charged before the agreement.
"We are in a state of crisis," said
Mehta. " I lie entire cash Mow of the
pipeline is guaranteed ... That
means that all ol India's assets, past,
present and future, are attached to
this deal."
I )abhol was assured a tax return
ol I () percent on i<ipit.il investment
with no limit on capital expendi
ture. Indian economists estimate
that after lax the return rate would
actually be .T2 percent. I Ins rate is
about three times the average rale
in the I nited States according to
Corporate Watch, a Web-based
corporate accountability project.
Many activists and economists
worldwide agree that the contract
is financially irresponsible.
Human rights violations
Corporate Watch reported that

Knron has been documented l)\
Human Rights Watch, Amnest\
International and the Woi Id Bank
lor various violations.
Among these violations is the
oustingol people from the land on
which Knron built their plant. I lie

land yields .11,000 to $2,000 pel
acre per year to its inhabitants
flie government is Ibrced undei
the agreement to sell the land loi
$ 100 an at re. So lar, aci ording t<
Mehta, SOO to 000 families havt
been Ibrced to leave their land.

Most have protested their eviction
.iiul as a result, have not received
even the sparse compensation they
are guaranteed under the con
trad.
"Highly-live percent of the peo
ple have not taken any money lor
their land, said Melita.
Mi'hta also s.iid that the opposi
tion to Dahhol has been nearly
completely silenced.
According a January 191)9
Human Rights Watch report,
"Huron's local entity, the Dahhol
Power Corp., benefited directly
I rom .in ollicial polic\ of suppress
ing dissent through misuse <>l the
law, harassment ol anti-Huron
protest leaders and prominent en
vironmental activists, and polite
practices ranging from arbitral ) to
brutal."
Despite these watch-dog
groups' conclusion that the Indian
government has handled the con
tract and evictions poorly, it is not
solely to blame, according to the
speakers.
"It would be nice to hold the
government accountable, said
('.hatterjee. "But there is ,i history
of this company walking into vari
ous places and paying no attention
to the impact on communities or
the environment."
According to ( '.hatterjee, Huron
lias also managed to skirl many ol
the environmental restrictions on
large corporations because it is ac
tively reinvesting in more promis
ing sectors, like Internet technolo
g\. It is now one of the largest sellers
of bandwidth in the world. It said.
But, ( hatterjee continued,
Huron has sold man v of its plants to
its own subsidiaries, washing its
hands of the pollution while keep
ing the business in the lainilv.
