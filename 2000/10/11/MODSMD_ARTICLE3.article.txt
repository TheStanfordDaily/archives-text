# Sand Hill Road widening project nears completion
## 
### MARK DOMINIK 
Phis November. Stanford Management
(Corporation will complete the widening of
Siiikl Hill Road lrom two lanes to lour be
tween San l ; i am iM|uito (Creek and the
Stanford Shopping (Center.
1 his widening, in conjunction with the
recently completed extension ol Sand llill
Road to El (Camino Real, should help re
duce congestion in the Sand I till Road (Cor
ridor, according to Robet I Reidy, construc
tion managet at the corporation.
Sand Hill Road was not a through street
in the past, leaving the Stanford Shopping
(Center with only one point of entrance and
egress. The extension has already led to an
improved traflic flow around the Stanford
Shopping (Center.
"| W'e| now have one more access point
into the shopping (enter. We have one
more additional road which will connect
next year â€” Quarry Road will gel a full
connection with El (Camino at that time,"
said Bill Phillips, managing director of real
estate at the corporation.
Before < onstt ttclion began on the exten
sion. there was a "long-standing pattern of
Sand I iill Road dumping [commuters] into
the shopping center's parking lot. Many
people use Sand 11 ill Road to go lrom | In
terstate] 280 to their homes," according to
Palo Alto (City (Councilman Bern Beecham.
l he ongoing construction of the (>2N
unit Stanford West Apartments, a CWH-unit
assisted living center and a 100-bed health

care center along Sand Hill Road provided
the impetus for the widening project. The
added UaHic these facilities will generate
makes a wider roadwa\ necessary.
Palo Alto has jurisdiction over most ol
Sand Mill Road and has approved the
widening plan on this section. Menlo Park
has not approved its portion of the road be
tween Alomita and the bridge over San
Fraiu is(juito (Creek, according to Rahimi.
I he city of Menlo Park has voiced strong
objections to the proposed widening of the
road near the city's boundaries.
"When Stanford (ante up with this pro
ject, the city of Menlo Park felt the docu
ment addressing the environmental impact
was inadequate in addressing the impact on
our community .... The widening of Sand
1 fill Road would have a negative impact on
the neighborhoods of Menlo Park," said
Jamal Rahimi, Menlo Park transportation
manager.
"When the Sand Hill Road (Corridor
Projects environmental impact report was
initially submitted, there was an average
delay for motorists of about 'JO seconds. Ac -
cording to Stanford's projections, even with
the $1 1 million of widening, that delay in
creases from about 30 seconds to about 00
seconds ... [and] the average delay goes
up to almost live minutes at one intersec -
tion during the peak period," said Menlo
Park Stall' Transportation (Consultant Dan
Smith.
