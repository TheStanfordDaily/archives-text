Mark Benning wasn't the
greatest of day traders. When he
lost (SO percent ol his investment
portfolio, he realized he needed
some help. Alter combing the In
ternet lor financial advice, and
finding nothing, he disc overed a
need for quickly accessible ex
pert advice.
So he did what any
technophile would do upon find
ing a pressing need: 1 le founded
an Internet company. Benning is
currently the Chief Executive
( Mlicer of EXP.com: 'The conve
nient way to get expert advice
and services.'
Mark Benning (MBA '94),
along with John Kremer (MBA
'94), founded EXP.com (f'ornier

1\ known as Advoco) in 1999.
EXP connects individuals to ex
perts in hundreds of categories
— from parenting to pets and
from financial planning to fitness
— who offer advice fora fee.
For example, if you need
help with your business plan, you
can find experts in strategic con
sulting from around the world.
(One-third of experts are from
outside of the I'nited States.)
When you find an expert you
would like to hire, you can com
municate with him or her via e
mail or phone through EXP. I he
expert charges per project or per
minute.
On the flip side, vou can sign
up to be an expert in a number of
different categories. EXP does
do a background check to vali
date credentials to help ensure
that experts are who they claim
to be. (airrently EXP c harges ex
perts a commission of 20 percent.
Financial and tax advice are
ihe most commonly sought, fol
lowed by business consulting and
technology and Web develop
ment. East month, more than
25,000 people received advice
through EXP.
EXP is doing quite well now,
but the road to success has not al
ways been so smooth.
After Benning graduated
from Harvard, he turned down
job offers from Wall Street to
play professional hot ke\ in Ger
many.
It was not until Benning and
Kremer arrived on the Stanford
campus as students at the Gradu

ate School of Business that their
entrepreneurial fire was lit.
"Stanford is like no other
place — there is an energy
that encourages new ideas
,ind cut repreneurship," said
Benning. "Here failure is a
mark of experience."
After graduating from the
Business School, both entered
the world of startups. Kremer
worked at several companies, in
cluding Instill, Intuit, I / l'R(),

and Ascend Communications.
Benning founded three compa
nies, including Release Now, be
fore starting EXP with Kremer.
Benning and Kremer met
each other over "sports, donuts
<md coffee," said Benning refer
ring to their weekly study group
during Business School.
I he two were a good match,
according to Kremer. "Benning
was the idea guy. He would
throw out ideas and 1 would

shoot them down, and together
we would build them back up,
stronger than they were before."
In founding the company,
Benning and Kremer relied a
great deal on their Stanford net
work. Six out of their first 10 em
ployees had Stanford ties. Most
of the investors <ilso have ties to
Stanford.
Not only are the two
founders of EXP, they are also
regular users and experts.

"As ilie need for financial ad
vice was the genesis of EXP, I
naturally rely on investment ex
perts at EXP," said Benning.
Willi the experience of founding
four companies, Benning him
self can be hired for advice on
startups and to review business
plans.
Kremer is also an expert and
user of EXP. He participates as
an expert in marketing and busi
ness development.
While you can hire either of
them to give you advice 011 start
ing <1 company, here is some ad
vice for free:
"Starting a company is all
about the people,' said Kremer.
"Ii is five percent the idea, and 95
percent the people."
Added benning: "You prac
tically live with the people in
your company, and you need to
be able to understand and get
alone with them."
