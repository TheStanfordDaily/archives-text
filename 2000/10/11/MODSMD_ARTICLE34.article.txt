# Nerd Alert: The Penguin
## 
### SALAS SARAIYA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Man has lor centuries tried to emulate winged
birds and take flight. And, except for airplanes,
dreams and suicide attempts, he has failed. Kven so,
the penguin, the Southern Hemisphere's ground
bird, has often been mocked by humans because of
its inability to tl).
Dale K. Magellanic, penguin and scientist ex
troadinaire, has changed all that, Ihrough hours
of inspirational labrator\ research, Magellanic has
(hanged the lace of science Ibrever.
A penguin is a penguin, of course of course, and
no one can talk to a penguin of course, even Mag
ellanic. Hut, since he is a ventriloquist, lie was able
to speak to us ihrough a (lummy. As usual, the role
of dummy was played by our own Salas Saraiya.
Why did you want to give penguins the ability to
fly?
For years, we've been maligned and slandered
because of our inability to Ily. We're grouped to
gether with ostriches. ()striches! ()striches run up
to 40 miles per hour. We don't run, or even jog.
We're swimmers; we spend 75 percent of our lives
in the water. And yet people lump us together be
cause we're'flightless birds." I figured il I could give
penguins the ability to Ily, we could light some of
these myths and misconceptions.
Plus, j"ve always wanted to visit the Arctic ()c ean.
I hear it's nice this time of year.
Can you describe your research?
Penguins are extremely social animals. I sei/ed
and tagged a male child penguin and removed him
from his friends. But I plac ed him close enough to
see his kin. I actually had to place him incredibly
close, since penguins have terrible eyesight. No
wonder I need glasses, eh?
So I placed him on a moat, close to his friends. I
placed a pit of piranhas between them. II he tried
to swim, he would have been attacked.
Penguins typically have stiff, short feathers that
overlap lor waterproofing. I cropped some of his
leathers and lengthened the others so he could
spread his wings and fly!
How did you get to be "Nerd of the Week"? I

thought you had to be a graduate or undergradu
ate student at Stanford. Are you a graduate or un
dergraduate student at Stanford? Did new Dean of
Admissions Robin G. Mamlet start a policy of ad
mitting penguins to Stanford? Is this new admis
sions policy part of the Endangered Species Act?
Lemmc alone. No one else was nominated.
Who can be nominated for "Nerd Alert"?
Any undergraduate or graduate student, il
doesn't actually have to be a nerd; I mean every
body at Stanford is a nerd. Know someone who
started a business? Know someone doing exciting
research? Nominate him/her. I here will be a
short interview, not unlike this one, with the win
ner each week.
