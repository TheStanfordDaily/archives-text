# RU-486:
## How does it work? 
### GREG NOVICK 
()n Sept. 28, the FDA approved
the controversial abortion pill
mifepristone, commonly referred
l<> as RU-486, lot use in terminat
ing pregnancies. The approval
reignited abortion debates at water
coolers all over the conntry. It lias
even become a key issue in the
presidential race â€” Al (lore avidly
supports the FDA's decision, while
(ieorge \\'. liusli describes the
FDA tilling as "wrong" and detri
ment.il to a "culture of life."
Rl -480, which was originally
developed by Rousell-l call ol
Fiance in the '80s, has been used
in Europe lor quite some time.
I he FDA approval will allow doc
tors and abortion clinics in the
United States to provide the drug
to patients within their first seven
weeks of pregnancy.
Danco Laboratories will pro
duce the drug under the name
"Mifeprex" in the form of a 200
nig tablet. A woman seeking to ter
minate her pregnancy must take
three tablets after consulting with
her doctor. The drug, known
chemically as C20H35N02, 'lien
halts the production of the hor
mone progesterone b\ binding to
the progesterone receptors in the
ovaries. The hormone is required
lor the planting of the fertilized
egg on the uterine wall and is es
sential for the continued develop
ment ol the egg. I he lack ol prog
esterone causes the uterus to shed
its lining, thus extricating the egg
from the wall of the uterus.
Two days following the dose of
mifepristone, women must take
another drug called misoprostol,
which is produced by Searle and
generally administered for the
treatment of ulcers. Misoprostol
causes contractions that expel the

embryo from the uterus. FDA and
European trials have shown that
mifepristone, when used with
misoprostol, is about 05 percent
effective in aborting a pregnancv.
The drug's safety is in question,
particularly because it causes ex
cessive bleeding. Two percent of
those who follow the treatment
may require an additional surgical
abortion and some may require a
blood transfusion.
Thus, along with the FDA ap
proval came strict guidelines
about the distribution of the drug,
as well as the required follow-up
visits to the patient's doctor to en
sure that the treatment proceeds
smoothly.
Mifepristone also has potential
applications in the treatment of
other conditions. The Washington
Post reports that limited trials of
the drug have demonstrated its ef

lectiveness in treating brain Ill
inois, fibroid uterine tumors and
ovarian, breast and prostate can
cers. as well as some types of" en
docrine disorders and depression.
Bee-ause ol the limited availabil
ity ol'the drug in the I nited States,
there have been ver\ lew clinical
trials ol mifepristone to date. II
mifepristone is demonstrated sale
and effective at treating fibroid tu
mors, lor example, it could save
many women the need for hys
terectomies, requiring instead
only a simple pill.
While there is great controver
sy surrounding the approval ol
mifepristone, its greater availabili
ty will certainly lead to more re
search and possibly safer abortion
drugs, fhe immediate battle,
however, will likelv be waged, not
by doc tors, but bv politicians and
activists.
