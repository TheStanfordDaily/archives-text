# RU-486: The big picture

I lie bioicch revolution," an often-used and some
times abused pln ase. It is a "revolution," but one that
has unlolded over (>,OOO years.
As out knowledge of biological organisms and
processes grows, out abilitv to control ever-smaller
11unponenls of "life" improves exponentiallyl oday,
we can not onlv control certain organisms but the very
essence ol the organism — the nucleic acids such as
I >\A .md proteins. 1 his ability will surely have a pro
found ellect on how we view the world and conse
(|ucnil\ how we construct our law to shape it.
I he legal svstem is responsive and experience
based. Rules gel over time to express societal norms.
(>tn svstem, although deliberate, develops to ade
(juatclv address the dailv dillit uliies ili.it we confront.
For example, we choose to criminalize "stealing" by
making Ha basic rule to punish a person who takes
I lie propei I \ ol another. As sot id\ evolves, this basic
i tile t an applv to animals and livestock as well as in
lellet dial propert\. Fo make the rule lit, we need to
modifv and expand concepts such as "take" and
"property."
However, (lie philosophical foundation remains
unchanged, and therein lies the difficulty with
biotecluiologv. Biotet luiologv lias the power to
< liange the bed rot k assumptions upon which the sys
tem lrsis. mi that, in some instances, distinguishing
what is "mine and "yours" becomes so tenuous that
the distinction is no longer useful.
\s Julian I luxlcv, a prominent scientist and social
commentator oft lie 1 Dtli centun. observed, "All large
biologic al disc overies are bound to ailed human leel
inos and insiincis, and set they will always by a great
proportion of mankind be greeted as impious, im
iikh aland indecent."
I his inid-lOth-ccnturv observation rings true in
the i in iciii debate over Rl -48F>, the "abortion pill,"
and foreshadows t hallenges to come, lis trek through
Aint i it an liistoi v sei \cs as an illustrative backdrop to
the ( in rent debate.
\ French researchei svnthesized Mifepristone, or
RU-486, in 1980. In 1982, after testing it for efficacy
in preventing pi egiianc \.it was found it) induce abor
tion I lie ID \. in 10S.">, issued testing permits lor clin
ical trials in the I niled Stales, which began in 108-1.
Nubsequentlv, no domestic manufacturers agreed
to produce the pill and, in 11)80, the I I )A banned ini
poriaiion of mifepristone lor personal use. I his rul
ing was challenged In lawsuit, and in 11)1)2 the
Supreme ( ouri relused to hear the case or end the
ban.
In II)!):'», President Clinton lifted the ban and tli
rctied lite Department ol Health and Human Ser
vices to review wavs to lest, license and manufacture
niilcpristone. I lie French patent holder in 1 DIM do

nated its U.S. patent rights to the Population (Council,
<i U.S. based organization that supports the right loan
abortion.
In 11)1)5, clinical trials began in the United Stales
and investors established the I)ant o (iroup to distrib
ute the drug. I he Population Council, in I DDF), ap
plied It) the FDA for approval of mifepristone. In Sep
tember of that year, ihe I DA gave conditional ap
proval of mifepristone. The FDA awarded final mar
keting approval to Danco Laboratories on Sept. 21),
2000.
Seventeen years after ii first entered the I !.S. regu
latory sv stem and in the midst of decades of intense
public debate, the "let hnologv was "available." This
experience was not unique to ihe I niled States.
Some European countries have approved even
more abortion measures. France recentlv approved a
contraceptive pill tailed \orlevo, that if taken within
72 hours following intercourse prevents pregnancy
In blocking ihe implantation ola fertilized egg in the
uterus.
While the French approved the abortion pill in
1088, anothci decade pasi before Britain, Sweden,
Austria, Belgium, Finland, (irecce, Israel and Spain
joined the lisi of conn tries I hat approved its use.
Although the dosage and protocols differ from
country to countrv, the patient's regimen is similar.
I he pill can be used within 10 (lavs of the beginning
ol the woman's last menstrual pel iod. Within that pe
riod. the woman takes three mifepristone pills.
Two davs later, she returns to the doctor fora sec
ond drug, misoprostol, that causes uterine contrac
tions it) expel ihe enibrvo. I o ftunplele the treatment,
she re!urns fin a lollow-up visit williin two weeks to
make sure ihe aboi tion is complete.
Prcdi( live estimates i aiigeon the abortion pills im
pact on ihe estimated I million I S. abortions per
formed eat h vear. Sources project that 10 percent to
.'lO percent of that number will eventually be per
formed using the abortion pill. In France, alter a
decade ol use, approximated 10 percent ol abortions
in the tounli v are t omplctcd with Rl - ISO.
Despite ihe I DA approval, ihe debate in the I nil
ed States continues. Afici ihe Supreme ('.ourl upheld
the right to abortion against its latest legal challenge,
mam concede that the battle is over access. Women's
access to ihe pill will be large!) determined In how
main doctors < boose to prescribe it.
In a survcv, sponsored In the Kaiser Family Foun
dation, onc-l hit tl of 707 physicians (lamih phvsicians
and g) necologists) sin vevetl w ho don't t in rcntlv pro
vide elective surgical aboi lions said tliev would con
sic lei pi csc ribing Rl I «S ( ">. Flic FDA's apprt »v a I details
provisions controlling prescription of the pill.
A recent bill proposed in legislators Senator Tim
Hutchinson of Arkansas and Representative loin
Coburn ol ( )klahoina, both Republicans, would make

law several conditions that the IDA had reportedh
considered but did not impose.
These provisions would include requiring pre
scribing physicians to know how to handle complica
tions oi an abortion, li would mandate th.it ilie doc -
tors know how to read sonograms, know how to pet -
lot in surgical abortions and maintain admitting priv
ileges at a hospital no more than an hour from their
ollices.
Some doctors also question whether the laws of
abortion .is a surgical procedure apply to prescribing
Rl - bSC). Stale regulations lor doctors who provide
abortions are often detailed, addressing the si/.e <>l
hallwa\s in their facilities, counseling on abortion al
ternatives and disposal of the letal tissue. Some states
require that doc tor's ollices meet the same require
ments as surgical suites. However, these regulations
can van greatly from stale to stale-.
So how do l he American people leel about the issue
of abortion? In early September a New York Times
C.IVS News poll showed, ".''o percent of those polled

said lliev wanted abortion 10 be generally available.
Bui a plurality, 12 percent, said that while they want
ed abortion to be available, then wauled stricter limits
governing it lhan ii lias today. Twenty-one percent
said abortion should not be permitted at all.''
Ihe deb,itc ovci Rl - ISO shows that "let hnology"
is more lhan .in invention oi something to marvel at
— it is an answer that explodes with questions. What
is the new < apabilitvr I low iN ii best integrated into so
ciety? rhe law by its nature is an experience-based sys
tem in which rules gel over lime to express societal
norms. Ii functions on the assumption that these
norms will express themselves with a high degree of
reliabiliu.
Biotec ImologA causes us to question out principles
and beliefs thai in main instances the law < annot ade
quate!} capture public sentiment. In the past, this
shortcoming was confined to i sin.ill subset of societal
problems. As innovations in biotechnology appear
with evei inc teasing regularil\. the questions we lace
grow increasinglv clillic nil.
