Prof. Fbrahim Moosa will haold a teach-in today at
noon iit led, "Crisis in Israel / Palestine: flunking
Historically about Current Kvents" in Building 200,
Room 203.
At the teach-in, sponsored by the History Depart
ment, Moosa and Beinin will address the historical
context behind the violence that is currently erupt
ing in the I loly Land.
Since Ariel Sharon, chairman of Israel's Likud
pat ty, visited the AJ-Aqsa mosque and Dome of the
Rock on Sept. 28 with Israeli soldiers, more than 90
people have died in dashes between Israelis and
Palestinians.
Beinin s speech .it the teach-in will be two-fold.
First, he will survey the history of confrontations in
the Holy Land going back to 1929 to demonstrate
that, to a considerable extent, the (intent conflict
was predictable. Second, he will try to address the
nature of the Israeli response to the violence.
Prof. Moosa will discuss the significance of the Al-
Acjsa mosque in the Islamic tradition.
After live- to 10-minute talks by both men, the
rest of the teach-in will be devoted to answering
questions about the conflict.
"The amount of good information that people
have [about the Palestinian-Israeli situation] is not
adequate," Beinin said. "There are a lot of sources
lor better information available, but a lot of people
don't go to them."
Beining said the reason why the teach-in is t.iking
place is clear: "Because Israel and Palestine are
burning," Beinin said. "It is obviously hot stuff."
