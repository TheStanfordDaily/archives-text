# ASSU leaders Newton, Villegas focus on activism, student input
## Taking the reins 
### COLLEEN O'BRIEN 
This year's ASSU administration
plans to shift iis locus from accommodat
ing student needs to promoting activism
and increasing student voice in institu
tional decision-making, ASSU officials
say.
I lie ASSI s official aim is to "repre
sent Stanford students to the University
and the world" according to iis Web site,
and the current officers plan to locus on
that goal.
ASSI President Seth Newton and
Vice President Malia Villegas, both se
niors, s.iid tliev are working on increas

ing student input on decisions made by
the Board of Trustees. The Board is re
sponsible for Stanford's investments, al
location of funds .ind shaping the Uni
versity s geneial growth and direction.
I niil now, students have not been in
cluded on the Board because trustees
don't believe students have enough
knowledge or long-range vision for the
University, Newton said.
"Students have a lot to contribute," he
added. "They have a sense of where the
University is now. whereas some of the
trustees attended the school 20, .SO and
40 years ago."
In a chapter in "( anipus. Inc.: C '.orpo

rale Power in the Ivor) lower," Newton
correlated a lack of democratic student
participation in university decision mak
ing and the corporate consciousness of
Stanford.
(her the past few years, the ASSU has
spearheaded some major improvements
in student life. The most visible of these
include expansions in the Marguerite
shuttle service and the recent design of
my.Stanford, a Web portal intended to
simplify use of the Stanford Web site In
bringing together some of its most com
monly used resources.
