# ASSU leaders Newton, Villegas focus on activism, student input
## Taking the reins 
### COLLEEN O'BRIEN 
This year's ASSU administration
plans to shift iis locus from accommodat
ing student needs to promoting activism
and increasing student voice in institu
tional decision-making, ASSU officials
say.
I lie ASSI s official aim is to "repre
sent Stanford students to the University
and the world" according to iis Web site,
and the current officers plan to locus on
that goal.
ASSI President Seth Newton and
Vice President Malia Villegas, both se
niors, s.iid tliev are working on increas

ing student input on decisions made by
the Board of Trustees. The Board is re
sponsible for Stanford's investments, al
location of funds .ind shaping the Uni
versity s geneial growth and direction.
I niil now, students have not been in
cluded on the Board because trustees
don't believe students have enough
knowledge or long-range vision for the
University, Newton said.
"Students have a lot to contribute," he
added. "They have a sense of where the
University is now. whereas some of the
trustees attended the school 20, .SO and
40 years ago."
In a chapter in "( anipus. Inc.: C '.orpo

rale Power in the Ivor) lower," Newton
correlated a lack of democratic student
participation in university decision mak
ing and the corporate consciousness of
Stanford.
(her the past few years, the ASSU has
spearheaded some major improvements
in student life. The most visible of these
include expansions in the Marguerite
shuttle service and the recent design of
my.Stanford, a Web portal intended to
simplify use of the Stanford Web site In
bringing together some of its most com
monly used resources.

ASSU President Setfi Newton and Vice President Malia Villegas plan this year to focus on in
creasing student input on important decisions. Other plans for the year include a summit on di
versity and an effort to procure University funds for community centers on campus.
I his year, the ANSI is also
planning "Fates of America," .1
summit on race and diversity,
which will bring well-known
speakers to campus to attract stu
dent attention and inspire dia
logue. Villcgas said.
" Then we'd bring it directh
back to Stanford in smallei meet
ings facilitated bv local people,
she said.
Another major goal of this
vcar's.VSSl is to procure I Diver
sity funding for campus commu
nity-center programming. Stan

lord < in renih provides paid stall
positions lor communis centers
but no 112 unding for programming.
1 he ASS I is also wot king on a
Stanford Voters I'rogram and a
program for student-initiated
courses.
With pi.ins to attack a number
ol issues, the ASS I needs student
involvement, Villcgas said, lap
ping into that energy lias been an
obstacle 111 past vears. Leaders
have bad difficult \ communicat
ing directlx with the student
body.
I he ASSI holds town-ball
meetings bin lias a bard time get
ting students to attend, Newton
said.
Despite 111 is historic lack ol sin

dent input, Newton and Villegas
said ihe\ arc optimistic about the
upcoming year. According to
them, ASM benefits Irom impor
tant foundations laid In past sen
ates, particularly regarding their
credibilii\ with the I niversitx ad
ministration. 1 his vcai, t hex hope
to increase theii credibility with
the students.
Some students have little or no
idea ol what the ASSI is or does.
Senior Angela (iengras said "I
know nothing about [the ASSI |.
It's m\ fault; I've never tried to
find out.''
Other students are aware that
their moncv goes to the ASSI , but
unsure of how it is used. Junior
Steve kalogeras said, "It seems like

a major cash cow oft he I niversily. I
wish I knew better how to access it."
Ibis year's ASSI' administra
tion intends to remedy this In
strengthening its connections with
the leaders of other student orga
nizations. I he\ are also attempting
to renew a direct link with the stu
dent bod) by publishing wh AS-
Sl p. a bi-weekly insert in The
Stan lord l)ail\ that updates stu
dents on ASSI progress, available
positions and meeting limes.
I his vear's leaders promise to
facilitate student involvement and
hope to inspire student confi
dence. I hey challenge students to
remember, as Newton put it,"the
ASSI is every student on this
campus."
