Other than its graying population
and high-priced real estate, Los Altos
has changed very little since its hey
day in the late 19705, a culmination
of decades of gradual growth, when
the little town — which prefers to he
referred to as a village —finally
began to rival its neighbor Palo Alto
as a fine suburban place to live.
According to Associate City Plan
ner David Kornfield, the towns pop
ulation of 2HMO is definitely tilted
- ioward those over 55.
"But the young urban professionals
... are definitely gaining ground
says Korn field, 34, who grew up in
Los Altos. "Most of Los Altos* growth
occurred after World War 11. And
many of those families still live here."
The town's beginnings were even
earlier. By the turn of the last centu
ry, the arrival of Stanford University
had changed the tempo of life amid
the Peninsula foothills.
