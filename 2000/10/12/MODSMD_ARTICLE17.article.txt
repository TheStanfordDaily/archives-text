## 
### 
OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — A judge took
the- unprecedented step yesterday ol order
ing the recall of as many <is 1.7 million Ford
cars and trucks sold in California, acc using
the automakci of concealing a dangerous
design Haw that can cause the vehicles to
stall in traffic.
1 "he ruling compounds Ford's troubles
as the automaker tries to steer its way out of
the Firestone tire ret ail crisis.
Ford lias insisted all along that the ignition
module at issue is sale, and it said it will appeal
the tilling, arguing that a California state
judge has no authorit\ to issue such an order.
Never before has a U.S. judge ordered
an automotive recall.
I he device was put on 29 models
between IDN.'I and lincluding the Tau
rus, LTD, Ranger. Bronco, Mustang and
Kscort, according to Ford. During that peri
od. I aurus was one ol the top-selling cars in
America.
Superior Court Judge Michael F. Bal
lache) said Ford sold as main as 2.3 million
vehicles with the flaw, lnit his jurisdiction
does not extend bevond California. Howev
er. similar class-action sniis are pending in
Alabama, Mai viand, Illinois, Tennessee and
Washington.
I he automaker has settled do/ens ol
wrongful-death and personal-injury law
suits nationwide in which a Ford vehicle was
suspected of stalling. But Ford never admit
ted any wrongdoing.
I lie National Highway Ira flic Safety
Administration conducted three probes into
the stalling ol Ford vehicles between 19N4
and l«)S7 and closed the cases after finding
no delects, agency spokesman Tim Hurd
said yesterday.
Ballachcy said that Ford knew since at
least 1 ( .)82 that the vehicles were prone to
stalling, especially when the engine was hot,
but failed to alert consumers and repeated
l\ deceived federal regulators by claiming

the modules were safe.
"This case was about concealment of ,i
dangerous condition," he said.
Government agencies normally order
recalls, but Ballachey said stale law gives
him that power.
Ford disagreed and argued that a ret ail
is unnecessary.
" The record in this case does not demon
strate a safety problem," Ford atiorne\
Richard Warmer said. " These vehicles are
sale."
The judge appointed a referee to stud\
three options—ordering Ford to remove
the modules and remount them away from
the engine, replacing the module with one
from 1999-2000 model vehicles, <>r order
ing a vehicle buyback. liallachey set an ()< t.
27 hearing to determine the next step.
Ford said it does not know how much a
California recall would cost, but the Cetitei
for Auto Safety estimated that it would be at
least $125 million.
The automaker already is involved in the
recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires, which
were standard equipment on Kxplorers and
other vehicles. Nil ISA is investigating
more than 1(H) deaths in connection with
the tires.
The judge's tilling was based on <i class
action lawsuit filed on behalf of 3.3 million < in
tent and former Ford owners in California.
The plaintiffs claim that the 111 module,
which regulates electric current to the spark
plugs, was wrongly mounted on the distrib
utor near the engine block, exposing it to
excessive heat and stress. I he plaintiffs sav
that caused the vehicles to stall.
Ford documents show the automaker
was warned by an engineer that high tem
peratures would cause the device to fail and
stall the engine. The documents also slum
that Ford confirmed the problem in inter
nal studies and could have moved the mod
ule to a cooler spot for S I per vehicle.
