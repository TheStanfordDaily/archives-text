NEW YORK (AP) â€” America Online
Inc.'s ambitious proposal to acquire media
giant lime Warner Inc. cleared a major
hurdle yesterday when it won approval
from Kuropean antitrust authorities, bin
the $120 billion deal still faces regulatory
challenges in Washington.
It also goes forward without the hoped
lor inclusion ot KMI Group of Britain and
with the condition the companies cut ties

with Bertelsmann AG, a German media
conglomerate that wants a bigget role in
the online world.
Bertelsmann will have to gradually exit
AOL Europe, its joint venture with AOL,
as well as a separate joint venture with
AOL in France. Ihe commission also
required that AOL I ime Warner not give
preferential treatment to music In Bertels
mann's subsidiary, BMG Entertainment.

AOL lime Warner's potential to domi
nate the music business, pari it ul.ii l\ in dis
tribution of music over tlie Intel net, was a
prime concern to European regulators.
I nder commission pressure, I ime
Warner last week withdrew .i separate joint
venture proposal with EMI. which would
have created <i massive industi v plaver and
reduced the number ol major worldwide
record companies from live to loui

In issuing its ruling, the commission
said that with Bertelsmann and its BMG
unit "lived to compete alone, the commis
sion concluded th.it AOL-TW wouldn't
have the critical mass in terms of music
publishing to dominate the market.'"
Hie locus of the deal now moves before
the Eederal I rade Commission and Fed
eral Communications Commission in
Washington. I he companies hope lor

approval this fall.
The Walt Disnev Co. and others wan
regulators to ensure that the merget
won't stifle competition from other medi.
companies and Internet service providers
The ability of the combined compan\
to dominate emerging Internet anc
entertainment services stub as interactive
TV has become a source of concern it
Washington.
