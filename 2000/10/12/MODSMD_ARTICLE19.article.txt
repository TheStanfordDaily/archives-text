## The
						Stanford Daily Promises come too close to manipulation

A TRUE GIFT is one that's freely
given. And surely anyone who has
heard about the collaboration of
Stanford and Palo Alto officials in
leasing land for the endangered Jewish Com
munity Center would agree.
However, some gifts, like this one, come
with strings attached. Very long, costly strings.
Palo Alto needs the land the center now sits
on. The existing middle schools in the district
are busting at the seams and are expecting
more growth for the next 10 years. In order
to relieve overcrowding, the district would
like to take back the facility they gave to the
center after shutting down Terman Middle
School in 1982.
To allow both programs to continue, Stan
ford would lease six acres of prime University

l.nul at the intersection of HI Camino Real and
Page Mill Road for the community center.
Stanford will charge the city $1 a year for
51 years.
But on Friday, the University announced
that ii would graciously offer the soon-to-be
displaced community center land in exchange
for entitlement to further develop the Stan
ford Research Park over the next 25 years.
The arrangement reeks of back-room politics.
Stanford's offer is contingent upon
approval of the General Use Permit and Com
munity Plan it submitted to Santa (lara (loun
ty. The plan will determine the University's
growth over tfie next decade.
At a press conference on Friday, University
President John Hennessy said that the agree
ment was made under the assumption that the

GUP would be approved. If the county does
not approve of the GUP or litigation concern
ing the deal is not settled by May 31st, 2001,
Stanford can withdraw its offer.
Not many gifts come with conditions like
that.
While no one in the community wants to
see the center homeless, Palo Alto residents
should also be concerned that Stanford is
using the community center as a bargaining
chip in land negotiations.
The move has been touted as the first step
in a new age of community-University rela
tionships. If this is the way all of the collabora
tions will work in the future, Palo Alto has
more to worry about than losing the center.
Fragile matters such as the relocation of a
religious and community fixture should not

be used in furthering the goals of the
University.
We applaud Stanford's decision to lease
the hind in order to help save a vital part of
the community. But the University's motives
can't be ignored. In order for the I niversity
to facilitate truly open and honest relation
shi| >s with the surrounding community, con
ditions such as those that came attached to
this plan should be avoided. Answers may
not come as quickly and easily but they will
be fair and open.
The needs of the community and Stanford
can both be met without resorting to the
manipulation apparent in this "gift." We urge
Palo Alto citizens to consider the repercussions
of this agreement and future negotiations that
involve such costlv concessions.
