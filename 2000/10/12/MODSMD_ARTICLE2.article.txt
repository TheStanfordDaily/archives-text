Hie new Theodore H. Ceballe
Laboratory lor Advanced Materi
als, w hie h will host advanced inter
disciplinary research in materials
science and engineering, recently
opened in tlie refurbished Mc(lul
lough Annex.
Brine Clemens. chair of the
Materials Science and Engineer
ing department, said that organiz
ing the lab work, of a varietv of de
partments under one roof will
allow for full use of cross-discipli
nan materials science.
Clemens c alled the lab "a great
complex lor investigating materi
als science lor the next century
(audi a big step lor the I nivcrsitv,
not just the department."
I le said the lab will play an in
tegral role in expanding the
boundaries ol materials science

and engineering research.
Recently, research in materials
science, such as Ceballe's stuck of
the growth of films, has begun to
progress rapidly.
Other instrumental scientists,
as well as some theorists, will also
use the lab to study applied
physics, materials science engi
neering, chemistry and several
other fields.
According to Asst. Prof, of Ap
plied Physics Martin (iteven, the
younger scientists at Stanford will
feel the lab's impact the most.
"The younger faculty and stu
dents will shape this laboratory,"
he said.
1 he renovation of the McCul
lough building started several
vears ago with the building of the
Science and Engineering Quad.
I lie latest renovation includes sev
eral faculty offices in addition to
the lab.
Creven said this combination of
office and laboratory space will
spark a gathering of graduate stu
dents, undergraduates and pro
lessors with various interests.
1 le said he hopes the) will Ibnn
brainstorming groups and em
bark on basic, sponsored research
that may eventually lead to break
throughs in medical science, aero
space and computer science.
According to Clemens, the Bi
ology Department will model its
new Bio-X lab after the Cabelle
lab. This setup will allow for inter
disciplinary research, the basis ol
the Bio-X program.
The laboratory was officially
dedicated to its namesake,
Theodore 11. Ceballe, Professor
Emeritus in Applied Physics and
Materials Science and Engineer
ing, on Aug. 23. Yesterday, the
University officially dedicated the
newly built annex to Robert
Moore of Intel.

The new Annex of the McCullough
Building houses the new Theodore
H. Geballe Laboratory for Ad
vanced Materials. The lab will host
interdisciplinary research in engi
neering and materials science.
