## The 						merits of debates 
### DREW HARRIS STAFF COLUMNIST 
Presidential debates are little
more than a glorified obstacle
course for candidates. Rather
than offering a chance fora
candidate to llesli out his platform, a
debate offers a chance to flub his cam
paign. Because it was widely believed
that Nixon lost the election due to his
debate with Kennedy, there were no
debates between 1960-76. Front-runners
feared the debate's power to destroy a
campaign. Since then, presidential
debates have returned to satisfy the pub
lic's bloodlust.
The Commission on Presidential
Debates, established in 10K7, has spon
sored debates for the last three elections
to provide "the best possible information
to viewers" about the candidates. In the
ory, debates permit c andidates to explain
their complicated tax plans and positions
on controversial issues. In reality, viewers
ignore or forget such details. Instead they
remember Nixon sweating or George
Bush, Sr. looking at his watch in bore
dom.
Although many factors contribute to a
candidate losing an election, disastrous
debate blunders - watched on television
by millions shortly before Election Day -
can be the crucial mistake. Gerald Ford
lost a tight race after saying Poland was
not under Soviet domination during his
1976 debate with Carter. A robot-like
Michael Dukakis responded without
emotion to a question about how he
would react to his wife's murder, helping
blow his 19M8 double-digit lead over
Bush.
Crafty politicians can exploit this
nationally televised obstacle course.
According to Clinton's debate coach,
Michael Sheehan, stupid mistakes like
Ford's slip-up happen at the "witching
hour that comes 60 to 70 minutes into
the debate." Clinton and Gore both held

out for 90-minute debates over the objec
tions of each Bush. George Sr. grew
impatient, looking .11 his watch towards
the end, and was pounded by the media
lor it. (Jeorge YV. initially looked strong in
the October 3rd debate, but lost steam as
the debate unraveled.
Kven a candidate's appearance to
viewers - which has nothing to do with
the policy debate - can be lethal. Televi
sion viewers thought Nixon, without
make-up and glistening with sweat, lost
the debate. Those who listened to the
debate on the radio thought he won. In
the litst debate, (lore insisted on speak
ing from non-adjustable lecterns, allow
ing him to tower over the shorter Bush.
Despites these potential traps, a candi
date cannot back down from a debate
without being punished by the voters.
But if he wants to explain his platibrm,
he is better oil doing it on Oprah. Talk
shows with Leno, Letterman and Larry
King attract more viewers and offer a
friendlier lorum to talk to the public than
the debates do. The October 3rd debate
only drew 4N million of the 75 million
viewers expected. It seems that making
candidates jump through hoops is not
entertaining enough for the average
American viewer.
Still, there are several reasons to make
candidates jump through those hoops.
Superficially, debates are the only occa
sion to see the candidates side-by-side,
and to see how the) react under pres
sure. More importantly, the debates are
a shared national experience that builds a
sense of anticipation about the elections,
drawing people to the polls. Debates can
also serve as a vehicle lor important pub
lic deliberation as candidates are Ibrced
to address hot issues they would rather
avoid. But for now, debates are largely as
George Bush Sr. described them - "show
business."
