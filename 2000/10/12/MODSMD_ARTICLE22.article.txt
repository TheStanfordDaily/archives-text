Stanford failed to respect Jewish
ritual observance
Monday was Yom Kippur, the Jewish
ritual Day of Atonement. I he observance
of Yom Kippur requires a 26-hour fast,
most of which is spent ai prayer and in
reflection. In accordance with the laws
governing this day, there is a ban on
work, which includes using electricity and
writing.
Yet, on ibis - the holiest day of the Jew
ish year - classes proceeded as scheduled,
professors continued to lecture, and stu
dents handed in assignments. For the
substantial percentage of students who
are Jewish, the choice is 'fall behind in
school or violate the sanctity of the holi
day.' Judaism or school? A significantly
larger percentage of the faculty also laces
this dilemma.
While not intentional, 112 his undermines
the Jewish community at Stanford. Last
year Stanford showed sensitivity towards
this problem. There were no mandatory
programs for Orientation on Yom Kip
pur, but this year the holiday fell late, in
the midst of classes, labs and testing.
In this tumult, we forgot to speak up.
We forgot to tell the university what a dif
ficult position this leaves us in; as a result
of our negligence, we have had to make
the unpleasant decision between aca
demics and religion.

We recognize, as Jews, we are not
alone in making ihis decision. Many other
student groups deal with similar conflicts
at various points throughout the year.
Ihe university has demonstrated both
sensitivity to the religious obligations of
students and capability to rearrange class
schedules.
( '.lasses are canceled for the morning
ol President Hennessey's inauguration.
This year out opportunity has passed.
Let's work with the administration to find
clever solutions to this problem.

Voters should examine Bush's record
Why would any one want a president
who just last year, as governor of Texas,
vetoed a hate crime bill that was passed by
the Texas legislature?
The bill was prompted by the horrible
death of a disabled black man in |asper,
Texas, who was dragged by a rope
behind a truck driven by while men who
hated black men.
It's not easy to forget the picture in the
newspaper of the dead man's father, sit
ting on a bench, staring at the ground in

disbelief after getting the news of George
YV.'s veto of the hate crime bill. It is
beyond my comprehension why Bush
would have vetoed it.
It's too bad people don't vote lor politi
cians based on their past records rather
than their empty promises made during
their campaign.
1 his is one past record I hope voters
haven't forgotten.
