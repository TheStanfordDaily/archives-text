### JENNY MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Samantha Crow is a regular sophomore by
day, bin b\ night, .n least Sunday nights, she is
Stanford's "Flicks ('.hick." (low's official title is
manager of flicks, a job that involves "all kinds
of things," she says with a laugh.
Crow's job is to pick and order the movies
from the distributor, hire the other Flicks stall
and do many oilier random things. Yes, she
picks i he movies. (irow wouldn't be a bad per
son to befriend — she wields a lot of power.
So how exactly does slit* decide on the Flicks
line-up? Willi a lot of help. Fhe members of the
Axe Committee, the other three Flicks stall
members and Stanford Siudenl Enterprises ex
ecutives all give input, but the final choice be
longs to ('.row.
She also i.ikes suggestions from her friends,
.ind recently, from student polls.
Flicks veterans may have been a little sur
prised lo see "I'reiiy Woman," the 1 ( .) ( .)() ro
mantic film that is now considered a classic, on

ilit- fall schedule.
This film tends to appeal more to girls than
to guys, a tact of which (Irow is perfectly aware.
"Last year there weren't enough chick
flicks," she lamented. Then she added, "When
you have a Flicks Chick, you get a chick Hick."
"Ii would be so nice if we could just go to
Bloc kbuster and rent [the movies]," Crow said.
Instead, one of the Flicks stall members con
tacts tlie distributor to order the upcoming
movie. Fhe lilms usually come in six reels,
housed in canisters, which must be picked up
and taken to Mem And.
"That was probably the worst part about
Flicks — those darn film canisters," said Matt
Sala/ar, a senior, and last year's Flicks manager.
A day or so before the show, the projection
ist splices the reels together. Fhe lilm is then
ready to be shown. And yes, Crow says, they
have to give the films back when they're done
with ilit-m.
I his year, (Irow says, her stall hopes to ensure
ill,u Flicks really is "More than J list a Movie," as
the slogan goes. Willi that idea in mind, they had

planned to give away swords to a few lucky pass
holders at the recent showing of Gladiator. But
the plan fell through.
"The swords all broke belbre the movie start
ed," Grow confessed. "We had too many sword
lights."
That didn't stop them, however, from tap
ing two swords back together and enacting an
on-stage sword fight during the movie.
Fun «uid games aside, Flicks is a real busi
ness, and the staff puts in a lot of hours, staffers
say. But working for Flicks seems to involve a
healthy mix of work and play.
"1 think there are few opportunities any
where that combine the energy and fun with a
real business experience," (Irow says.
And after all, where else but Flicks are stu
dents encouraged to yell obscene comments
and pelt one another with paper balls?
Sophomore Simha Redely sums it up: "It's
not just about the movie, it's about the atmos
phere — yelling 'Brainier Sucks!' It's a Stan
ford tradition."
He's right. See you Sunday.
