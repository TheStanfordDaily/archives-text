## Top-ranked women prepare for title run with pre-NCAA meet Women harriers head to lowa to face strong field in NCAA Championship preview 
### MINAYO NASIALI STAFF WRITER 
Nearing the season's midpoint, the No. I
ranked Stanford women's cross country team
faces another weekend of travel at the l're-
NC.AA'sat lowa State University.
Many contending cross country teams will
be competing, which should motivate Stanford
to continue its attacking attitude.
So fin" this season, the Cardinal has compet
ed in lour invitationals, Sacramento State, Fres
no State, Stanford and Notre Dame consecu
tively. Stanford placed first in all lour meets and
remains unchallenged as the to}) squad in the
nation.
As a result of Stanford's superiority on the
course, the team has had the opportunity to test
its strengths and weaknesses and explore itself
as a unit by experimenting with the line-up of
runners in the different races.
Stanford is looking to expand the depth of its
team and promote the team's cohesiveness.
With new additions such as freshmen Jillian

Mastroiamii and Victoria Chang, the fate of the
team is no longer weighing solely on the shoul
ders of veteran top scorers like senior Julia
Stamps and sophomore Lauren Fleshinan.
With other strong runners like sophomore
Erin Sullivan, redshirt junior team captain
Elena Villareal, and redshirt freshman Lindsay
Hyatt, Stanford has been able to run different
team members in each race.
11l is has allowed runners to rest between in
vitationals. That way, when thev do run, they
are at both their physical and mental primes.
For example, Elena Villareal ran well in the
Stanford Invitational and was the first Stanford
runner over the finish line. However, she did
not run at Notre Dame last weekend, which al
lowed Lauren I leslnnan to return to the Stan
lord attack alter a brief hiatus.
Victoria ( hang also performed inipressiveh
in the Stanford Invitational to finish second
after Villareal; however, she too did not run at
Notre Dame. Jillian Mastroiamii lias put in a lot
of race time, competing in the Fresno State,
Stanford and Notre Dame Invitationals. How
ever, she will not be running .it lowa State this
weekend.
"At the Pre-NCIAAs, we will be taking a com
pletely new team," said assistant coach Delia
Evans. "We are giving each of our team mem
bers an opportunity to excel."

Maria Villareal said alter I lie Stanford Invi
tational that the team was in phase one o! its sea
son's goals at that point. 1 hey were working on
the well-being of the team, and testing the abil
ities <>r new recruits.
I he Cardinal now enters the next stage <>l
the season. Although they continue to promote
team unity, they are now exploring the depth of
the team and preparing lor the upcoming na
tion. il championships.
"Ibis meet is another measuring point on
the road to nationals," said Evans.
The pre-national championship meet in
lowa is a solid checkpoint ibr two main reas< >ns:
First, the National Championships will be
held at lowa State, which will give the (Cardinal
an advantage in familiari/ing itself with the
course before the NCAA's, which will be held
there in November.
Second, Stanlbrd will compete against main
of the leading teams in the nation like No. 2
Wisconsin and No. Kansas Stale. With this
heightened level of com pel it ion, the Cardinal
will have the opportunity to rise to the chal
lenge of these contenders in preparation for
facing these teams again at N( A Vs.
"\\'e enter each meet with the opportunit\
for success," said Evans. "Each meet is a new
challenge but our team is more than
prepared."
