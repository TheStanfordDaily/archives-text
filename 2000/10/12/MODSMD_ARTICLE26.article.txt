# A
						great game 'four' everyone

### 
The madness has gone on
long enough. Battles
have been fought,
friendships and families
broken, lives changed forever over
this divide, and today we will settle
the debate.
Which is a better game: four
square or wiflleball?
Rules
Anyone who's ever played,
watched or heard of baseball
knows how to play wiflleball. The
world of bats and bases, strikes and
singles, homers and hanging
curves is familiar.
Most wiflleballers modify the
basics, since (lor example) striking
out looking in wiflleball is slightly
more stigmatized than clubbing
baby seals.
Four-square tends to take a lit
tle more work to remember, see
ing as how most people last played
when their brains were addled
with Lucky ('.harms and Capri
Sun IS hours a day.

Usually, it takes place in a large
square, subdivided into four other
squares, in which one player is re
sponsible for each subdivision. II
the ball bounces into your square,
you've got to bounce it back to an
other player's square before it hits
the ground again.
Sounds simple, but so does
Ceorge W. Bush, and he has his
own state. We'll call it a tie on this
front.
Variants
It's not wiflleball if you don't
have half a dozen ground rules:
the old oak tree is in play, hitting
into the river is an automatic out,
balls can be played off the roof,
designated hitter must go lor beet
during the inning.
Most of these are by necessity —
sadly, most metropolitan areas
haven't seen the wisdom of fund
ing a wifHeball-only stadium.
But mixing up the rules is the
very essence olTour-square, where
the "king" of the current game can

call lor classic rule changes like Bus
Stop, Around 1 lie World, Body
Parts, liny rim, Klectric Fences,
even the ever-popular Mad Max (a
two-person variant in which two
men enter, one man leaves).
Four-square is like the Jelly of t he-
Month club — it keeps on giving.
Every neighborhood has its own
terms lor dillerent styles of play;
every time you play it's a new joy.
Fdge goes decidedly i<> lour-square.
Equipment
I he long yellow bat, the sculled
plastic ball — these are icons of
childhood. Not much more need
ed lor a game, except lor bases —
rocks, T-shirts, dead rodents.
Most everyone's experimented
with the big red bat, capable ol
turning any (bur-lbot fifth-grader
into Mark McCiwire, but big red
bat abuse has been alleged to cause
back acne, testicular shrinkage
and. worst, labeling as a 'wussie.'
Four-square needs masking
tape, chalk, or some natural play-

ground mark
ings to mark oil
the playing liclcl.
1 lie big advan-

tage to four-square is the I).ill it sell
— the red rubbei ball, probabl)
the most versatile tool 111 spoils.
Show me a child who can't en
tertain himself lor hours with a red
rubber ball and I'll show von a fu
ture tax attorney. Edge to lour
square here.
Organization
There are hundreds or thou
sands ol official .ind unofficial wil
lleball leagues around the count rv,
ranging in Icrvel of sophistication
from 10-year-olds getting togethei
in a park to teams ol steroid-abus
ing. tobacco-chewing 'career' wil
flers playing in front ol packed
stands on a Friday night.
I here is, as far as I can tell, pre
cisely one official four-square
league in the country, which ap-
