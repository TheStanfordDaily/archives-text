### AARON LEVINE 
Mashes <>l lightning struck
Monda\ morning at the Kdean
Ihlanfeldt Invitational.
Maybe the lightning was a
good omen, because Wednes
day afternoon saw flashes of bril
liance from the Stanford
women's goll team, led by senior
Stephanie Keever.
Keever posted a three-round
total of even-par 21 (> to lie for
the individual title, while the

YVA.

the r>,9f>3-yard, pat-72 course to
tie lulsa's Stacy I'rammana
sll(ill (71-71-72) for medalist
honors.
I lie Cardinal jumped from
fifth plat e after two rounds into
the runner-up spot on the
strength of a third round total of
2 ( .) ( .) — the second-best team
store of the day behind No. 4
USC (297).
Possibly even more impres
sive was the performance of
Ireshman Angela Rho. Making
her first collegiate start. Rho
posted an even-par 72 in the
third round to lead the (Cardinal
surge.
Rho finished in sixth place with
i (muds (»l 7-77-72 (22 I, + 8).
Senior Milan llomeyer, who
shared All-American honors with
keever alier a second-place iinisll at
t lie \( A\( hainpionshipsl.ist year,
lied lor ITili altet posting a three
<l.i\ total of 2:10 (77-70-77, + 1 I).
Sophomore kim Rowton tied
tin 171h (211) and Jessica llelskis
placed 53rd (242),
I he (Cardinal looked solid,
heating eight ol the nine Pacific 10
( onlerence teams that played in
the event. No. 1-ranked \ri/ona
was the onl\ l'ac-10 team absent
Irom the tournament.

Alter being delayed two and a
lull hours on the liisi da\ ol the
tournament due to lightning,
Keever a 2-under par 70 to tie
lor the individual lead, keever,
who had live top-10 finishes last
yeai and wh<>se best finish was a lie
lor third at this event, < arried .1 two
stroke lead into the lin.il round.
I he (Cardinal women's goll
learn showed Wednesda\ that it's

perleci hlend ol mixing the old
with the new.

didn't exact 1\ have a relaxing sum
mer. Fach competed in the I .S.
(an tis ( aij), the World Amateur
Championships, and the l .S.
Women's Amateur C lhampionships.
I lomexer also qualified lor the
I S. Women's Open iu |une and

even held a piece ol the lead mid
wax through the* first round.
I hese two have enough experi
ence under their belts to perform
in am clutch situation.
Since the Cardinal's third se
nior, Salimah Mussani, decided to
redshirt this season, the two fresh
man additions, Angela Rho and
Kim kowalninpat, will surely
make an impact in <tnv case.
Rho showed Wednesday that
can step up into a leadership
position, and that <|iialit\ will be
import,ml il the Cardinal want to
contend lor championships later
in the season.
I lie (Cardinal will liosi the next
