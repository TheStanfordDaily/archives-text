### BEN ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
It is undefeated with a pool of talent
whose depth cannot l>c matched any
where, so it's a wonder ii took until
Monday's coaches' poll for the (cardinal
men's cross country team to rise to the
No. 1 spot in the country.
New the squad faces its first real lest
of tlu- season — traveling to lowa State
University in Ames on Saturday to de
fend its newly-acquired lofty perch.
Stanford is set to compete in the
lowa Stale Memorial dross Country
Classic this weekend, a race that will
also serve as the official NCAA pre-na
tional meet.
The NCAA Championships are slat
ed for the same venue in Ames on Nov.
20.
Despite the absence of traditional
rival and second-ranked Arkansas, the
race should he no jaunt in the park for
the Stanford harriers.
Six of the nation's top ten teams, in
cluding No. 3 Colorado and Pacific 10
Conference rival Arizona, at No. 10. are
scheduled to toe the line aside the Car

dinal in a field of more than 50 teams.
Stanford assumed the No. I position
Monday after back to back romps over
large fields— first at the Sept. 30 Stan
ford Invitational and then at last Fri
day's Noire Dame Invitational.
Arkansas lost two weeks ago to Divi
sion 11 Abiline (Ihristian yet suffered lit
tle in last week's poll — Abiline is noted
for it's recruitment of talented Kenyan
runners, and athletic age restrictions
are much less strict among Division II
schools.
It was the Cardinal's run in Indiana
that caused the change in the rankings.
This weekend, all schools will be
gunning for Stanford, since the compli
cated system of advancing to the
NCAA's championship meet rewards
teams who knock off highly-ranked
teams during the course of the season.
Stanford, however, has little lo lose
and will likely use the meet as a trial run
for the national meet.
The N,OOO-meter course that will be
run Saturday will differ very little from
the 10,000-meter course for the nation
al meet just over five weeks away.
Coaches Vin Lananna and Michael
Reilly traditionally use the NCAA pre

nationals as an opportunity to scope the
terrain and scout potential problems in
order to avoid them come November.
I he meet is less helpful, however, in
simulating the look and feel of
NCAAs.
"The pre-nationals for the men has
not been anything like the nationals,''
Lananna said last year before the same
meet.
"The race doesn't go out the same
way. We've won the pre-nationals the
last couple of years, and it has not been
very hard."
Stanford took the pre-national
championship last year but settled for
fourth at the NCAA meet behind
Arkansas, Wisconsin and North Caroli
na State. Those three teams did not
compete in the pre-nationals last year.
Though not all the top competitors
will be in attendance, the meet will at
least give Stanford runners the chance
to test out some of the individual com
petition they (an expert to face in No
vember.
