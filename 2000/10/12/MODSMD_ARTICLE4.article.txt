### NICHOLAS CHAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A final decision on the new Dean ol'the Stanford
Medical School may come in a few weeks, according'
i<> Associate Provost Jell Wachtel. I le said a commit
tee led by President John Hennessy and Patholog\
Dept. ('.hair Steve Galli is entering the linal stages ol
its decision.
After interviewing hundreds of candidates, the
committee has narrowed its list down to approxi
mately 12 names.
1 his confidential list will be passed to Hennessv
and Provost John Etchemendv, who will both pick the
final candidate.
The committee had originally hoped to name the

new dean in February, bclore for
mer President Gerhard Gasper's
term expired, bin the deadline was
pushed back several times.
The deadline was moved from
January to April, then June and
then to September. Now the com
mittee hopes the end will come in a
few weeks.
Wachtel said the delav resulted

from Irving to understand the dis
tinctions and the responsibilities of the new job.
"Ii took us a while to finally gel the position de
scribed clearly so that people could understand what
they were getting into," he said. "It's jusi become a
more complicated search."
A list of characteristic s released last spring savs that
the new dean must lit several professional and per
sonal qualifications, including a willingness to work
with others, previous experienc e, creativity and ener
gy*
When the new clean is named, it will end a process
that dates back to 1994, when Gasper wanted to cre
ate the position of Vice President of the Medical ('.cu
ter. This position would complement the already-ex
isting position of Dean ol the School of Medicine.
1 le wanted to divide the position, because the clean

ical ('.enter, which consists ol the
Stanford I lospilal and (llinics and
the I.mile Packard Children's
I lospital.
As llennessy s.iid in August,
"the job that [current dean] C.ene
| Bauer] is currently trying to do is
too big lot one person."
I lie vice president will preside
over clinical operations at the lios
pitals and clinics, while the dean
will bet <mie the chiel'academic of
ficer, similar to the deans of the
University's other schools.
When the merger between the
Stanford Hospitals and the I C-
San Francisco Medical Center
arose, Stanford postponed the
creation of the job.
When the merger collapsed in
November 1999, the idea of the
vice president returned.

I mil a permanent dean could
be found, then-Vice President
Bauer took 011 the additional role.
Ihe committee of 12 people re
sponsible for finding the new
dean consists ol (acuity, alumni
and a single student from the
medical school.
Within that committee is a
smaller steering committee,
known as the "committee of live."
Stanford lacultx recommended
some candidates. Advertisements
placed in academic and scholastic
journals helped to lind the re
maining ones.
()ne-t|uartei of the candidates
interviewed are currently in
volved with the Medical School
while the other three-quarters are
not. according to Wachtel.
Although .1 medical degree was
recommended, the linal candid.lit
is not required to have one.
"We're confident that we'll
have .1 good outcome so the wait
will be well worth it." said Wac htel
