## Cammidge seeks to trim turnover 
### SUSAN TIEH 
Because of Ihe area's highly com
petitive job market, Stanford has fat ed
difficult) in retaining members of its
administrative stall. As a result, Kxecu
tive Director of Human Resources
|olui Cammidge has begun new pro
grams to significantly reduce Stan
lord's current 25 percent administra
tive-turnover rate.
1 his figure means that 25 percent
of the administrative stall leave Stan
lord everv year lor a job elsewhere. Ac
cording to Cammidge — who as
sumed his position last spring, suc
ceeding I'eggy lliraoka— the high
turnover "hinders the University in
fulfilling its educational and research
roles."
The new programs to reduce this
figure aim to improve compensation,
training, supervision and recruitment.
"{Administrative turnover is) a gen
eral affliction in Silicon Valley and

Ac t oss the Bay Area"
and not unique to
Stanford, Clam
midge said.
I le said the tight
job market hinders
employee retention,
while the high cost ol
living and housing
discourages others

from relocating to the area for work.
Cammidge said the housing situa
tion was "horrifving" and mentioned
cases in which the University has failed
toemploy its desired applicant bet ause
of the area's expensive housing.
fhe new Stanford West Apart
ments on Sand Mill Road offer staff
"alternative accommodations," he
said, but the housing problem will "re
quire mam solutions, not just one."
Linda |ack, manager of staff em
ployment, said that the Human Re
sources department is focused on
"moving housing forward" and im

proving the housing situation.
The high turnover rate also leads to
many staff vac amies, which force other
employees to work harder to cover
other jobs. Cammidge hopes to fill
these vacancies through an expanded
employee referral program that will
include the entire campus.
T his program will oiler emplovces
c ash awards if their referrals are hired.
Jack said th.it referrals are the "best
hires" because employees know Stan
ford's workplace culture and will refer
only those that are a "best fit. She
noted referrals have the highest reten
tion rates as a result.
Cammidge also hopes to (fec i ease
turnover by improving Stanford's
working emironmcnt. 112 lewants to "in
volve everyone" in the l/niversity in
implementing efforts to improve em
ployee morale.
