()n ()t tober 13, 193 1, The Daily pub
lished an article called "Sisters Starve as
Cook Sticks in Floor Paint."
"What is the difference between slow
and fast? Just two meals, according to
members of the Alpha O House.
"Deciding that the kitchen floor looked
Awlul Low, the sisters purchased and ap
plied a quantity of quick-drying paint.
Came the dawn and the cook.
"Result â€” tracks beginning at door
ending abruptly in person of said cook ma
rooned in middle of floor, stove temptingly
in distance.
"The sisters called up the salesman. He
was very apologetic; he had given them the
24-hour drying kind by mistake; he hoped
it wouldn't put them out. 'Oh no, just can't
eat, that's all.'
"Dinner was salvaged via the pantry
window. Deciding that groceries are the
staff of life, the house committee has post
poned further action on the floor."
Bottom line: Painting the cook to the floor? That
could explain the food in Wilbur Hall.
