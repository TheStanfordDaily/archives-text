members ol (lie Alpha () 1 louse.
"Deciding that the kitchen floor looked
Awlul Low, the sisters purchased and ap

Came the dawn and the cook.
"Result — tracks beginning at door
ending abruptly in person of said cook ma
rooned in middle of lloor, stove temptingly
in distance.
"The sisters called "|> the salesman. He
was very apologetic; he had given them the
24-hour drying kind by mistake; he hoped
it wouldn't put them out. 'Oh no, just can't
eat, that's all.'
"Dinner was salvaged via the pantry
