## Suicide bombers attack U.S. ship in Yemen; sailors killed 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” In a sinister
slip through Navy security, suicide
bombers in a small boat tore a gaping
hole in a U.S. warship yesterday at a
refueling stop in a Yemeni harbor on
the Arabian Peninsula, I S. ollicials saw
1 he blast killed five members of the
crew, injured three do/en and left 12
missing.
1 he crippled ship was lilting slight 1\ in
the harbor at Aden, Yemen, but the Navy
said it was not in danger of sinking.
No one has claimed responsibility
Defense Secretary William Cohen told a
Pentagon news conference.
President Clinton said the attack on
the USS Cole, one of the world's most
advanced warships, appeared to be an act
of terrorism, the worst against the U.S.
military since the bombing of an Ait
Force barracks in Saudi Arabia in 1996
that killed 19 troops.
"We will find out who was responsible
and hold them accountable," Clinton
pledged.
He dispatched to Yemen investigative
teams from the FBI, ihe State Depart
ment and the Pentagon. Clinton also
ordered a heightened state of alert lot .ill
U.S. military installations around the
world.
After the attack, ambulances rushed to
the port, and Americans working with
Yemeni authorities cordoned off the area.
Security sources said without elaboration
that a number of people had been
detained for questioning; it was not clear
whether any were suspects.
The State Department issued a world
wide alert, saying it was extremely con
cerned about the possibility of violence
against U.S. citizens and interests. Ameri
cans were urged to maintain "a high level
of vigilance."
In a parallel travel warning, Americans
were advised to defer .ill travel to Israel,
the West Bank and Gaza, and those
alreadv there were told to stav at home or

get to a safe location. Americans were
warned not to go to Yemen.
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
talked with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, pledged his cooperation in the
investigation and visited some of the
injured who were hospitalized locally. He
insisted in a CNN interview that his coun
try did not harbor "terrorist elements"
and said, "I don't think it's a terrorist
attack."
The Cole is a $1 billion guided missile
destroyer home-ported at Norfolk, Va. It
had sailed through the Red Sea and was
en route to the Persian Cull Where it was
to perform maritime intercept operations
in support of the U.N. embargo against
Iraq. Ihe ship has a crew of about 350
people.
Navy medical teams were en route to
the scene yesterday to treat those injured
in the 5:13 a.m. KDT explosion, Pen
tagon ollicials said. I .S. aircraft capable
of evacuating the injured were also sched
uled to fly to Aden.
The incident was all the more stunning
given that I S. forces in the Middle l.ast
have been on a heightened slate of alert
in recent days and security plans lor a
port visit like the Cole's are drawn up in
advance.
I lie Cole had just arrived in the har
bor and was scheduled to leave in about
four hours, officials said, suggesting the
attackers may have known the ship's
schedule and the procedures lor a refuel
ing stop.
Adm. Vein Clark, the chief of naval
operations, said he could not fault the
Cole's crew lor not preventing the mid
day attack that apparently was carried out
by two men in a small harbor craft that
was helping tie up the ship's mooring
lines at a fueling facility in the middle of
the Aden harbor.
As a participant in normal harbor
operations, the small boat's presence did
not raise suspicions, Clark said.

"1 have no reason lo think this was
anything hut a senseless ac t of terrorism,"
Clark said.
Alter helping the Cole moor, the sin,ill
boat came alongside the warship and
apparently detonated a high-explosive
bomb, killing themselves in the process.
Some reports said the two men in the

boat stood at attention as the bomb
exploded, although Clark said lie could
not verify such details based on early
information.
I lie explosion ripped a hole 20 feet
high and 40 feet wide in the midsection of
the ship. Hooding the main engine com
partment. Clark said the Hooding was

brought under control and the ship was
not in danger of sinking.
Clark displayed a Navy photograph of
the damaged ship. The jagged edges of
the hole in the hull protruded inward,
suggesting the explosive force came from
outside the ship at roughly the water
level.
