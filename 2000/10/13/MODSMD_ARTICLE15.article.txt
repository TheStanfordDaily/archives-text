## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — His
dream of Middle East peace
shattered by a dramatic escala
tion of violence, President Clin
ton implored Palestinians and
Israelis "to stop the bloodshed,
to restore calm" and begin talk
ing rather than lighting.
"I call on both sides to under
take a cease-lire immediately,
and immediately to condemn all
acts of violence" a somber Clin
ton said yesterday after a Pales
tinian mob killed three Israeli
soldiers and Israel retaliated
with rocket attacks on Yasser
Arafat's residential compound.
The sense of crisis was height
ened by an apparent terrorist
attack on a U.S. Navy destroyer,
the USS dole, that killed five
Americans as the ship was being
refueled at Yemen in the Arabi
an Peninsula. Twelve sailors
were missing and 36 were
injured.
"If, as it now appears, this was
an aci of terrorism, it was a
despicable and cowardly act," the
president said, standing before
cameras in the Rose Garden.
"We will find out who was
responsible and hold them
accountable."
Clinton returned to the
White House from Chappaqua,
N.Y., where he celebrated his
25th wedding anniversary with
his wife, Hillary. What was
planned as a day of golf was
replaced by crisis meetings.
The president conferred with
Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger. He also
talked by phone with Arafat
twice and with Israeli Prime Min
ister Ehud Barak, Egyptian Pres
ident Hosni Mubarak, Jordan's

Minister Tonv Blair and U.N.

Secretarv-General koli Annan.
"All the leaders share the
president's concern thai we have
to ramp down the violence"
before it escalates further, said
National Security Council
spokesman P.J. Crowley.

Clinton shares some of the blame.

" This violence was all 100 pre
dictable, given ilie heavy pres

Palestinians to come to a peace
agreement," Helms said in a
written statement. "Neither the
Israeli people not the Palestini
an leadership was ready lor an

It was a mistake to try to force
them to do so."

appearances at two fund-raisers
and the Hispanic Chamber ol

A legacy-minded Clinton has
made Mideast peacemaking a

encounter disappointment after
disappointment with the col
lapse of the Camp David sum
mit, diplomatic failures and a
resumption of violence.
"We are greatly concerned
that instances of this kind can
easily escalate into something
even more dangerous," Crowley
said. "The president under
stands how serious this situation
is and we are doing everything
in our power to prevent a fur
ther escalation."
Crowley said Arafat told Clin
ton that he, too, deplores the
violence and that Palestinian
police tried to protect the Israeli
soldiers, Crowley said.
"I strongly condemn the
murder of Israeli soldiers in
Ramallah today," the president
said. "While I understand the
anguish Palestinians feel over
the losses they have suffered,
there can fx- no possible justifica
tion for mob violence."
