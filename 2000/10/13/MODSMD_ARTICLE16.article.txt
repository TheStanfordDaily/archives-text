### 
WASHINGTON (AIM — Cele
brating the political rebirth of
Serbia, President Clinton lifted key
trade and economic sanctions to
demonstrate support lor Belgrade's
newly installed government.
"The victory of freedom in Ser
bia is one of the most hopeful
developments in Kurope since the
fall of the Berlin Wall," the presi
dent said yesterday, "li ended a
dictatorship and it can liberate an
entire region from the nagging
fear that ethnic differences can
again be exploited to start wars
and shilt borders."
Clinton announced the imme
diate ending of the oil embargo
and flight ban that were imposed
in 190S to punish and isolate the
regime of Yugoslav President Slo
bodan Milosevic.
"The removal of these sanc
tions is a first step to ending Ser
bia's isolation," Clinton said in a
written statement.
James C. O'Brien, the senior

U.S. official overseeing develop
ments in I he Balkans, met with
new Yugoslav President Vojislav
kostunica in Belgrade yesterday
to oiler congratulations on kostu
nica's election victory and to high
light the message that further
progress is expected.
Clinton acted just days alter the
European Union lifted its own oil
embargo and loan on commercial
flights to and from Serbia, the
principal Yugoslav republic.
"We have a strong interest in
supporting Yugoslavia's newly
elected leaders as they work to
build a truly democratic society,"
(llinton said.
The EU did not remove sanc
tions th.it froze overseas assets of
Milosevic and his allies and pro
hibited ihem from traveling to 15
EU nations.
Clinton said the United States
would also ensure that the lifting
of sanctions does not allow Milose
vic's supporters "to continue the

systematic theft of resources that
have marked the last IS years."
"Our disagreement was with
the Milosevic regime, not the peo
ple of Serbia who have sullered
under the regime's brutal poli
cies," the president said.
"In that vein we will continue
to enforce a ban on travel to the
United States by top members of
the Milosevic regime and keep in
place measures that help the new
government deter a looting of the
national patrimony during the
current period of transition in
Yugoslavia," the president said.
He saicl the administration also
would review restrictions on Ser
bia's participation in international
financial institutions "as Serbia
makes its democratic transition and
meets its international obligations."
A spokesman for the Interna
tional Monetary Fund, Thomas
Dawson, said yesterday that
Yugoslavia could be re-admitted to
the IMF within a few months time.
He saicl the country would
have to come up with a plan for
dealing with $128 million in out
standing IMF loans it held in 1992
when the country lost its member
ship in the IMF and World Bank
as the nation began fragmenting.
"We welcome the new team's
intention to join the fund and
other international institutions."
Dawson said, saying an IMF mis
sion would likely soon travel to
Yugoslavia, possibly along with
officials from the World Bank,
which indicated earlier this week
that it was also ready to re-admit
Yugoslavia to membership.
IMF and World Bank mem
bership is important because it
will encourage the private foreign
investment Yugoslavia needs to
rebuild its war-torn economy.
"There is still much work
ahead for the Yugoslav people
and their new government:
restoring confidence in the rule of
law, rebuilding an honest econo
my, accounting for the past while
building fora better future," Clin
ton said.
