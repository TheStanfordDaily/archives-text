## The 						Stanford Daily Med School dean decision too long delayed 
### 
Published Since IH l )l

2000 I lAS BKKX a banner year lor admin
istrative transitions, from the ()llice ol the
President to the dean ol admissions. Yet.
while these ollices begin the 2000-2001
academic year with vigor, the Office ol the Dean
of the Medical School is languishing. I lie medical
center is not exactly .1 bastion of stability, and its
lack of motivated leadership will only contribute
io its further deterioration.
I hiring the Stanlbrd-l ('SI* merger three years
ago, ( '.asper specified that the clean ol the medic .tl
school would be responsible lor addressing med
ic.il school issues, and created the position of the
vice president of the medical c enter to oversee
clinical operations.
Dr. K.ugene Bauer, the dean at the time, was
"temporarilv" appointed as vice president until a
suitable replacement could be found.
Bauer lias served in both capacities lor three
years.
Now, with the Stanlbrd-L'C.SF dissolution in
full elled, the medical center has returned to its

pre-merger structure: one clean, no vice presi
dent. Last vear, Bauer agreed to remain as "tem
poral v" dean until a permanent replacement
could be found. Sound familiar?
I he deadline lor the search committee — the
first deadline — was to be at the end ol winter
2000. Xo such hit k. I lie next deadline? April 15,
2000. at the- I rustees meeting. Not quite ready,
sorrv. | line? July? September 1?
I he search committee, which includes Univer
sii\ President I lennessv, eight medical school pro
lessors, two natural science professors and a med
ical student, lias not been able to explain the
delavs. Yes. the lisi of candidates at one point
exceeded 100 people. Yes. the committee is con
cerned with being thorough — talking with
departments ai Stanford and at other universities
and soln mug advice from various hospitals in the
Ba\ \rca — but out ol the>sc 1 00 people, and after
nine months of ruminating, was not one
appropriate?
I he deadlines have come and gone, and not

only does the Stanford community seem to have
stopped noticing, but people appear to be utterly
apathetic about the state of limbo in which the
medical center finds itself.
Perhaps a delineation of this state would help
galvanize some interest.
First: the UCSF-Stanford fallout. The financial
carnage of this dissolution exceeds $00 million.
I hc blow is even more than the expected $48 mil
lion. I low is Stanford to turn this loss around?
Second: Last year, the medical school oh-so
narrowly avoided being placed on probation by
the Liaison Committee on Medical Kducation.
Probation equals no accreditation equals no med
ical school until the wrongs are righted. This cer
tainly dot's nothing to bolster the medical center's
status, let alone bolster the education ol its medi
cal students.
Third: Social distresses, especially in the form
of gender discrimination, rifle through the medi
cal center with disconcerting consistency. Dr.
Frances Conley, a neurosurgeon, was just

rebelling against the tip ol the iceberg with her
book "Walking Out on the Boys," which details
her experiences with both subtle and overt sexu
al discrimination.
The seemingly inexplicable foot-dragging of
the nominating committee can only exacerbate
the woes of the ailing medical center.
Dr. Bauer is an accomplished dermatologist
and has served Stanford well over the past three
years. However, he is merely holding down the
fort until a replacement is found.
Xow is the time to catalyze the search, recog
nize the selection of a new clean as the utmost pri
ority and devote full energy to that selection, i he
medical center needs stable and dedicated leader
ship so that it can go about the business of help
ing its patients — without budget issues, educa
tional probation or social unrest pervading the
atmosphere.
By delaying the selection of a new clean, the
medical center is stabbing itsell in the back but
refusing to seek treatment.
