# SALAD DAYS
## Into the courtroom 
### JOSH KIENITZ STAFF COLUMNIST 
Everyone knows our society is
becoming more litigious In the
dav. Lawsuits and lawvers and
liability, oh mv! It seems like one
person can sue another person or institu
tion lor almost anything these davs, and
I'm led lip with it.
I hat's right, I'm led up with not hav
ing am grievances to sue lor. I want m\
piece ol the pie. I deserve tin day in
court. So here's mv plan: I'm going to sue
Stanford I niversit\ lor depriving me ol
the abilitv to appreciate mv homeland,
the Midwest.
You see, I was alwavs a bit restless in
western ()hio. loo much corn, too many
cows, too manv conservatives and so on. I
felt that I would lit in a little better in a
place with more diversity, a place with
more liberals, a place with more sun
shine. So I went oil to Stanford, and
(blind it to mv liking.
Nonetheless, the first time I came
home from school, in December 1 ( .)98, it
felt reall\ nice. It lelt like I was returning
home, returning to ni\ roots, and it was a
good lecling. All ol the "Impeach Clin
ton" signs were a mere distraction. I he
good old "countrv air" (characterized by
the smell of manure) was just a small neg
ative. I enjoyed that Christmas, and even
lelt <i little melanc hoh when I left in |an
uar\ to come back out to Calilbrnia.
A year and a halt later, the whole situ
ation has changed, lieing in ()hio for the
last couple weeks of the summer, I dis
covered that I was utterly unable to toler
ate the use of the word "lag." (That's
Midwestern lor "homosexual.")
In the same vein, the word "gay" is
used all over the Midwest as a slang for
"bad." "I lev man. didn't vou think that
teac her was ga\." means "that teac her is
bad." M\ ears arc completely incapable oi
hearing things like that and ignoring
them. Mv friends look at me like I'm
crazy when I tell them I don't like hear
ing those words. And I blame Stanford.
Driving on Interstate 7"), which goes
through mv hometown, I see a message

lot ilit' umpteenth time, in big neon
lights on the side of a plastics factory.
"< I IRIS I IS I 111 WSWLR!" ii screams
ai me. Shoot, I've lorgoiien the question!
(Ihrisi is I lie answer to wh.il, exactly?
Since the neon lights are so big and
btight. I assume n is an important ques
tion. But one ol the mam things I've
learned at Stanlord is that answers lo
important questions are rarch monosvl
labic. I reallv think that il I were ai one
with the soul ol the Midwest, 1 would be
able to understand this little game ol the
ological |eopard\ presented to me on the
side wall <>la plastics laciorv. I feel out of
place in western Ohio. And 1 blame
Stanlord.
At Stanlord I also learned a bit about
world geographv. I herelore, the I niver
sit\ owes me lor the discomfort I feel
while I am in these Ohio towns: Versailles
(pronounced Ver-sales), Rio (irande
(pronounced Rve-oh (irand), Russia
(pronounced Roo-sha), Houston (pro
nounced I low-ston) and even m\ home
town, Lima. When people read it, the\
invariablx pronounce it like the great
Peruvian capital. Hut, ,ilas. we're named
alter the Lima bean (Lve-mah).
Rene Russo's character in"The

So, for ihe loss ol im homophobia, the

suing Stanlord I nivcrsity for one million
