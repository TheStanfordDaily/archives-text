# Spring labor rally sees positive results
## 
### TANYA AVILA 
In ihc wake of the "Justice lor
Janitors" march and rally lie-Id at
Stanford in April 2000, a new con
tract was settled lor janitors of the
Service Kmployees International
Union Local 1877, which includes
those service employees working
for the University, during the
summer.
Last spring, the Stanford Labor
Action Coalition, now known as
the Student Labor Action Com
mittee, collaborated with other or
ganizations in the Justice lor Jani
tors campaign, assisting approxi
mately 5,000 janitors at Stanford
and in the Bay Area.
The J list ice lor Janitors rally on
campus gathered more than 225
students, surrounding communi
ty members and staff, including
the janitors themselves. This rally
came at the end of the janitors' ne

gotiation period and occurred si
multaneously with other marches
throughout the Ba\ Area and Los
Angeles.
"I think all the rallies, including
ours, got the negotiations moving
along so the janitors didn't have to
stl ike," said Lolita Roibal. a coali
tion leader. "Their contract ended
May 31, and part of their contract
states that they cannot go on
strike, so they would have started
striking the next day, when they
could legally strike."
Although Student Labor Ac
tion Committee organized the
voice of Justice for Janitors on the
Stanford campus, the student
group served as one of many col
laborating alliances for this move
ment. Five months after the cam
pus-wide collaboration among
students, faculty and stall, individ

The April 4 rally held on campus to support the "Justice for Janitors" cam
□n drew students concerned with a contract that didn't allow some Stan-
Janitors to make a living wage.
uals now look to see il the Stan lord
campus campaign was a success
and if students' efforts made posi
tive effects.
"Definitely our goals were to
build momentum to work on larg
er labor issues on campus and be
yond, and I think we did that,"
Roibal said.
()ne of the pressing concerns of
tlie tally was to pni pressure on
American Building Maintenance,
the janitor contractor for Stanford,
to arrive at fait negations for jani
tors over the next three years. A
successful agreement was reached
in June, indicating the strength of
the organizing movement of the

janitors' union and the Justice for
Janitors campaign.
The settlement allows fora 9
percent pay raise each year. This
filial negotiation was a great im
provement from American Build
ing Maintenance's original oiler of
a increase each year, ac cord
ing to coalition members.
Although the SITU 1877 began
the new agreement demanding an
11.1 percent pay increase, a nego
tiating team of both union mem
bers and employers signed the 9
percent settlement. The hourly
wage foi Stanford janitors and
others in the Bay Area has in
creased from $8.04 to $8.76.
In 2002, at the end of the
three-year contract, they will be
paid $20,820, a $4,740 difference
from what janitors made this pre
vious year.

1 he rally was held partly in re
sponse to then-University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper's and Asso
ciate Vice Provost for Facilities
Christopher Christoflerson's re
fusal to make a public statement in
support of the janitors, according
to coalition members. University
officials said at the time, that they
did not want to interfere with the
negotiations.
Alongside the rally, the com
mittee submitted a letter bearing
more than 72 faculty members'
signatures to Casper encouraging
University administration to re
spond to the janitors' request to
become involved in the janitors'
c ause, according to Shaw San Liu,
a committee member.
The coalition intended the rally
to remind the University of its so
cial responsibilities as a leading in

stitution in education and an ad
vocate of public service. The
demonstration on campus
showed that students, janitors and
community members recognize
and hold the University account
able lor its power in determining
the conditions under which those
who clean this campus work, said
Roibal.
"The campaign was effective
because janitors start to take lead
ership roles in the union," Liu said.
Liu said that, overall, the cam
paign was extremely successful.
Although the new contract did not
meet all the initial demands of the
SKID 1877. the rally signified that
students are concerned about the
livelihood of those individuals
who maintain campus facilities.
The janitors' contract will be
renegotiated in 2002.
