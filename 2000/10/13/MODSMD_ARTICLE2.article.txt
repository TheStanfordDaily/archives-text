Janitors" march and rally lie-Id at
Stanford in April 2000, a new con

Union Local 1877, which includes
those service employees working

the Student Labor Action Com

and in the Bay Area.
The J list ice lor Janitors rally on
campus gathered more than 225
students, surrounding communi

throughout the Ba\ Area and Los
Angeles.

ours, got the negotiations moving

May 31, and part of their contract

strike, so they would have started
striking the next day, when they
could legally strike."

Stanford campus, the student
group served as one of many col
laborating alliances for this move
