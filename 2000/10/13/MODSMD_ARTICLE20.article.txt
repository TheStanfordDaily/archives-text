Students find presentation of
Israeli / Palestinian conflict biased
Wednesday's histor) department
teach-in, while offering to provide a "liis
torical perspective" on the current "cri
sis" in the Middle l-.ast. provided only an
ami-Israeli platlorm lot the attending
students. Ihe History Department was
irresponsible in failing to provide a bal
anced perspective on the volatile and
pertinent issue of Palestinian / Israeli
confrontation. The lopsided panel choice
limited the scope of instruction to a
biased set ol claims, grievances and his
torical perspective.
I he department's choice of panelists
was deceptive. Ebrahim Moosa, a Muslim
professor of Islamic thought, was chosen
to present "the significance of Jerusalem
in the Muslim conception." One would
have assumed that his counterpart on the
panel, (oel Bcinin, a Jewish professor of
Middle-Eastern history, was chosen to
present the significiance of Jerusalem in
the Jewish religious perspective.
Instead, Bcinin was chosen to present
a historical account of the struggle. In
effect, the panel lacked anyone to present
the supreme importance that Jerusalem
holds lor Jews. Furthermore, Beinin's his
toi \ was highly selective, decisively anti-
Zionist and hostile toward Israel.

Professor Bcinin revealed his overt
hostility in a remark in which he implied
that Jews' mistreatment of Palestinians is
an imperfect form of trauma-driven re
enactment of Nazi mistreatment of Jews.
Such a statement itifantilizes and demo
ni/cs Israel, negating its existence as a
rational entity with well-founded claims
and thoughtfully motivated actions.
Jewish students in the audience were
rightfully a (Iron ted. Professor Mary Lou
Roberts asserted that student comments
could provide the perspective missing in
the panel. However, students cannot
articulate that perspective with the same
c redibility and preparedness of Prolessor
Bcinin. Ihe panelists commanded the
respect commensurate to esteemed facul
ty, set the agenda for discussion and
came prepared with statements and a
lifetime's study.
The teach-in represents a valuable
opportunity squandered. It could have
informed students on the complexities of
an issue that affects us all. Instead, the
History Department presented an
incomplete perspective that reinforces
the distance and misunderstanding on
the issue between Jews and Muslims.
There cannot be a meaningful discussion
about the current crisis on this campus il
the collective understanding of its history
is stilted.

I am writing in response to the "teach
in" on the current situation in the Middle-
East that occurred in the History Corner
on Wednesday. As many may know, the
discussion was sponsored by the History
department and led by History Prof. Joel
Beinin and Religious Studies Prof.
Ibrahim Moosa.
I he discussion was set up in the single
most one-sided manner of any event that
1 have attended while at Stanford. The
panelists' presentations began with Pro
lessor Moosa describing the importance
ol Jerusalem for Muslims and continued
with a vitriolic diatribe by Professor
Beinin in which he basically made a veiled
argument against the very right of the
state ol Israel to exist.
I hroughout his comments, Beinin
made no attempt to maintain even the
slightest notions of historical objectivity as
he even implicitly equated the actions that
Israel has taken over the past 50 years to
