Students find presentation of
Israeli / Palestinian conflict biased
Wednesday's histor) department
teach-in, while offering to provide a "liis
torical perspective" on the current "cri
sis" in the Middle l-.ast. provided only an
ami-Israeli platlorm lot the attending
students. Ihe History Department was
irresponsible in failing to provide a bal
anced perspective on the volatile and
pertinent issue of Palestinian / Israeli
confrontation. The lopsided panel choice
limited the scope of instruction to a
biased set ol claims, grievances and his
torical perspective.
I he department's choice of panelists
was deceptive. Ebrahim Moosa, a Muslim
professor of Islamic thought, was chosen
to present "the significance of Jerusalem
in the Muslim conception." One would
have assumed that his counterpart on the
panel, (oel Bcinin, a Jewish professor of
Middle-Eastern history, was chosen to
present the significiance of Jerusalem in
the Jewish religious perspective.
Instead, Bcinin was chosen to present
a historical account of the struggle. In
effect, the panel lacked anyone to present
the supreme importance that Jerusalem
holds lor Jews. Furthermore, Beinin's his
toi \ was highly selective, decisively anti-
Zionist and hostile toward Israel.

Professor Bcinin revealed his overt
hostility in a remark in which he implied
that Jews' mistreatment of Palestinians is
an imperfect form of trauma-driven re
enactment of Nazi mistreatment of Jews.
Such a statement itifantilizes and demo
ni/cs Israel, negating its existence as a
rational entity with well-founded claims
and thoughtfully motivated actions.
Jewish students in the audience were
rightfully a (Iron ted. Professor Mary Lou
Roberts asserted that student comments
could provide the perspective missing in
the panel. However, students cannot
articulate that perspective with the same
c redibility and preparedness of Prolessor
Bcinin. Ihe panelists commanded the
respect commensurate to esteemed facul
ty, set the agenda for discussion and
came prepared with statements and a
lifetime's study.
The teach-in represents a valuable
opportunity squandered. It could have
informed students on the complexities of
an issue that affects us all. Instead, the
History Department presented an
incomplete perspective that reinforces
the distance and misunderstanding on
the issue between Jews and Muslims.
There cannot be a meaningful discussion
about the current crisis on this campus il
the collective understanding of its history
is stilted.

I am writing in response to the "teach
in" on the current situation in the Middle-
East that occurred in the History Corner
on Wednesday. As many may know, the
discussion was sponsored by the History
department and led by History Prof. Joel
Beinin and Religious Studies Prof.
Ibrahim Moosa.
I he discussion was set up in the single
most one-sided manner of any event that
1 have attended while at Stanford. The
panelists' presentations began with Pro
lessor Moosa describing the importance
ol Jerusalem for Muslims and continued
with a vitriolic diatribe by Professor
Beinin in which he basically made a veiled
argument against the very right of the
state ol Israel to exist.
I hroughout his comments, Beinin
made no attempt to maintain even the
slightest notions of historical objectivity as
he even implicitly equated the actions that
Israel has taken over the past 50 years to
the Holocaust that Na/i tiermany commit
ted against the Jews.
For an event that was hilled by the His
tory department as a fair and even-handed
discussion <>1 the Middle East's current cri
sis, the panelists' presentations were deeply
disturbing. At no time did the History
Department attempt to provide its students
and the community at large with a Jewish
or Israeli perspective on the issue. Even
more disturbingly, the department made
almost no effort to distance itself from the
extremist viewpoints espoused by Professor
Beinin.
1 would ask that the University in gen
eral, and the 1 listory Department in partic
ular, do three specific things to correct the
dearly biased nature of this event:
1) Issue a public apology on behalf of the
department in order to restore its reputa
tion for academic excellence.
2) Initiate a follow-up panel discussion in
which the viewpoints of all sides, including
traditional Jewish and Israeli ones can be
fairly heard.
3) Begin a search fora qualified and even
handed expert on the Middle East to coun
terbalance Professor Beinin's extremist
agenda.
ARIKI RATNER
Junior, History
The "Mideast Crisis Teach-In" on
Wednesday was not an "exchange of
ideas," as advertised. Had the event been
labeled " The Palestinian View of Israel," I
would not be upset about it. Yet, I find it
disgraceful that the history department
attempted to pass oil this affair as anything
but a propaganda platform for
anti-Zionists.
Professor Ebrahim Moosa presented a
very interesting and informative speech
about the religious significance of the old
city of Jerusalem to the Muslim faith.
Unfortunately, this was followed by a
severely biased account of events leading
up to the recent Palestinian riots in Israel,
presented by a sell-proclaimed expert on
Middle-Eastern history.
This "historian," Prof. Joel Beinin, pre
sented a very narrow interpretat ion of bits
and pieces of the Arab-Israeli conflict. He
claimed that, in 1929, the Jews of Hebron,
a city in what was then called Palestine, pro

voked their Arab neighbors by flying a flag
with a Star of David on it. Beinin claimed
this "horrifying act" justified the wave of
gruesome Arab pogroms that followed,
during which Arabs killed more than 60
Jews, forcing the Jews to flee the peaceful
communities in which they worked side by
side with their Arab neighbors.
Similarly, Beinin willfully neglected to
mention the long and bloody history of
Palestinian barbarism against the Jews of
Israel, ranging from the massacre of
Olympic athletes in Munich to that of
kindergarteners in the c ity of Ma'a lot.
In his desperate effort to paint the Pales
tinians as innocent lambs, he ignored the
most shocking ac ts of violence perpetrated
by the PLC): the violence it inflic ted against
fellow Palestinians during the "Intifada"
uprising of the 1980s.
Following the same pattern of "selective
history," Beinin asserted that Israeli Knes
set member Ariel Sharon's visit to the Tem
ple Mount "provoked" the violent Pales
tinian riots of the past two weeks.
Unfortunately, there was no other pro
lessor on the panel at the "teach-in" to
include some pertinent facts that really
explain the violence of the past few weeks.
Firstly, two Israeli soldiers were killed by
their Palestinian Authority counterparts
one day before Sharon's infamous visit.
Secondly, Beinin failed to mention the
numerous instances of incitement to vio
lence and murder propagated over Pales
tinian Authority-run radio and television,
also prior to Sharon's visit. This proposed
popular uprising against Israel was set to
begin on Rosh I tashanna, a Jewish holiday.
Sharon's visit to the Old City of Jerusalem
coincided with their planned intifada and
was used by the bloodthirsty PA as an
excuse to the international community for
murder.
The following information was obtained
from the Jerusalem Post, a highly respect
ed and widely read newspaper in Israel
acclaimed for its objectivity. The Palestinian
Authority, a government constructed to
further the interests of the Palestinian peo
ple, instructs its people to violently murder
and injure as many Israelis as possible,
promising a place in heaven to all martyrs.
1 lie promises of the PA extend beyond
the immaterial realm, however. In a recent
statement to its people, the PA encouraged
Palestinians to send their children into the
line of fire to increase the negative portray
al of Israelis in the world media bv labeling
them child killers.
The reason so many c hildren are being

killed is that their parents and FA militia
men cynically use them as shields to protect
themselves from Israeli soldiers as they
themselves fire at the Jews. For every child
killed in the line of lire, the PA gives $2,000
to that child's family.
Are these the same Palestinian "freedom
lighters" that Beinin so lovingly embraces?
They indeed are!
At one point in his diatribe, Beinin
equated Israel's treatment of the Arabs to
the Nazis' treatment of the Jews during the
I lolocaust. This spurious claim is not only a
severe insult to the intelligence of any ratio
nal human being, but it also tarnishes the
memories of hundreds of my relatives who
perished in the gas chamlxTS, ghettos, fir
ing squads and concentration camps of
Nazi Europe.
Though Beinin's shocking comments
were greeted by a small but loud chorus of
"boo"s, there were no other speakers at this
teach-in to refute his claim.
1 do not blame Professor Beinin for not
providing another professor to present a
different viewpoint at this teach-in. Beinin
simply exploited the ill-organized History
Department to provide him with .in official
forum fi>r his stilted, one-sided personal
views regarding Israel.
The person at fault in this case is the
organizer of the teach-in, Mary Louise
Roberts. In response to students complain
ing of one-sidedness in the presentation,
Roberts said th.it she fell the non anti-Zion
ist students "seemed to be holding their
own." After the teach-in, she justified her
narrow choice of presenters, claiming that
one Jew and one Arab sufficiently span the
spectrum of viewpoints on the Palestinian
rioting in Israel. As a member of the facul
ty at a s< h<k>l that ranks among the best in
the world, Roberts should know better
than to make a statement like that.
To use an analog) that Beinin stated in
his Israel-bashing speech, it is not the bull's
limit for destroying the china in the china
shop, it is the shop owner's fault for letting
the bull in. Beinin is that bull, and Roberts
is that shop owner.
Had 1 not known better, I would sav
that choosing only one person, with a very
slanted and racist outlook, to speak about
anything on anv sort of panel would be an
honest mistake which anv uninformed,
unworldly and uneducated person could
make. However, I do know better. Roberts
knows full well that Beinin has a viewpoint
embraced by an unbelievably small minor
ity of Jews, and ignorant ones at that.
Roberts has worked with Beinin lor years,

and should know well enough that his per
spective is severely tainted by a fanatically
anti-Israel bias.
It is a cruel time when, less than 60 years
after the attempted annihilation of the Jew
ish people, the world continues to turn its
back on the Jews who are struggling to sur
vive in the only place they know of as
home.
This university, like other universities,
bears the responsibility for spawning and
shaping the intellects of the future. It is sad
that Stanford's History Department choos
es to use its power to brainwash and pro
gram the world's most intelligent youths by
misrepresenting and falsifying so painful a
history as that of Israel.
Whatever its agenda may Ik-, I can only
hope that reason and truth will prevail.
Lx'ave the Jews alone. Is 0 million not
enough?

("Stanford failed to respect Jewish ritual
observance," Oct. 11) regarding Stanford's
failure to respect the observance of Yom

ASSU financially independent from
University and students
In an article on the ASSU president and
vice president in List Wednesday's Daily
("Taking the Reins"), Colleen O'Brien
wrote, "()ther students are aware that their
money goes to the ASSU, but unsure of how
it is used, junior Steve kalogeras said, It
seems like a major cash cow of the Univer
sity. I wish I knew better how to access it. "
I his statement perpetuates a misunder
standing commonly held by members of
the Stanford community: The ASSU is
financially supported by student fees. This
is not true.

Every student will find on their Univer
sity bill a line for "ASSU Fees." These tees
are the special fees that students vote on
ever)' year in the Spring general election.
These fees support student groups — not
one dollar noes to support the activities of
theASSU.
The ASSU is completely financially
independent from the University. The
ASSU budget is funded by an endowment,
which is comprised of the retained earnings
of its business arm, Stanford Student Enter
prises. Neither the University, nor the stu
dent body, contribute to the annual ASSU
budget.
Every student has the opportunity to
refund their fees: simply visit the ASSU
Web site. However, every student should
understand that, by requesting a refund,
you are withdrawing your financial sup
port from student groups, not from the
ASSU. Further, by requesting a refund,
you are forfeiting your ability to participate
in services, benefits or events provided by
these groups.
Finally, I want to point out that the Stan
ford Guardian, a group currently flyering
campus, is guilty of misleading students.
Requesting a fee refund has no efiect on
the ASSU, it only afiects student groups
who receive special fees.
If you would like to learn more about
the ASSU or its funding, visit the ASSU
Web site at http://assu.stanford.edu, contact
the ASSU president, Seth Newton, at

discussion <>1 the Middle East's current cri

disturbing. At no time did the History
Department attempt to provide its students
and the community at large with a Jewish
or Israeli perspective on the issue. Even
more disturbingly, the department made
almost no effort to distance itself from the
extremist viewpoints espoused by Professor
Beinin.
1 would ask that the University in gen
eral, and the 1 listory Department in partic
ular, do three specific things to correct the
dearly biased nature of this event:
1) Issue a public apology on behalf of the
department in order to restore its reputa
tion for academic excellence.
2) Initiate a follow-up panel discussion in
which the viewpoints of all sides, including
traditional Jewish and Israeli ones can be
fairly heard.
3) Begin a search fora qualified and even

terbalance Professor Beinin's extremist
agenda.
ARIKI RATNER
Junior, History
The "Mideast Crisis Teach-In" on
Wednesday was not an "exchange of
ideas," as advertised. Had the event been
labeled " The Palestinian View of Israel," I
would not be upset about it. Yet, I find it
disgraceful that the history department
attempted to pass oil this affair as anything
but a propaganda platform for
anti-Zionists.
Professor Ebrahim Moosa presented a
very interesting and informative speech
about the religious significance of the old
city of Jerusalem to the Muslim faith.
Unfortunately, this was followed by a
severely biased account of events leading
up to the recent Palestinian riots in Israel,
presented by a sell-proclaimed expert on
Middle-Eastern history.
This "historian," Prof. Joel Beinin, pre
sented a very narrow interpretat ion of bits
and pieces of the Arab-Israeli conflict. He
claimed that, in 1929, the Jews of Hebron,
a city in what was then called Palestine, pro

voked their Arab neighbors by flying a flag
with a Star of David on it. Beinin claimed
this "horrifying act" justified the wave of
gruesome Arab pogroms that followed,
during which Arabs killed more than 60
Jews, forcing the Jews to flee the peaceful
communities in which they worked side by
side with their Arab neighbors.
Similarly, Beinin willfully neglected to
mention the long and bloody history of
Palestinian barbarism against the Jews of
Israel, ranging from the massacre of
Olympic athletes in Munich to that of
kindergarteners in the c ity of Ma'a lot.
In his desperate effort to paint the Pales
tinians as innocent lambs, he ignored the
most shocking ac ts of violence perpetrated
by the PLC): the violence it inflic ted against
fellow Palestinians during the "Intifada"
uprising of the 1980s.
Following the same pattern of "selective
history," Beinin asserted that Israeli Knes
set member Ariel Sharon's visit to the Tem
ple Mount "provoked" the violent Pales
tinian riots of the past two weeks.
Unfortunately, there was no other pro
lessor on the panel at the "teach-in" to
include some pertinent facts that really
explain the violence of the past few weeks.
Firstly, two Israeli soldiers were killed by
their Palestinian Authority counterparts
one day before Sharon's infamous visit.
Secondly, Beinin failed to mention the
numerous instances of incitement to vio
lence and murder propagated over Pales
tinian Authority-run radio and television,
also prior to Sharon's visit. This proposed
popular uprising against Israel was set to
begin on Rosh I tashanna, a Jewish holiday.
Sharon's visit to the Old City of Jerusalem
coincided with their planned intifada and
was used by the bloodthirsty PA as an
excuse to the international community for
murder.
The following information was obtained
from the Jerusalem Post, a highly respect
ed and widely read newspaper in Israel
acclaimed for its objectivity. The Palestinian
Authority, a government constructed to
further the interests of the Palestinian peo
ple, instructs its people to violently murder
and injure as many Israelis as possible,
promising a place in heaven to all martyrs.
1 lie promises of the PA extend beyond
the immaterial realm, however. In a recent
statement to its people, the PA encouraged
Palestinians to send their children into the
line of fire to increase the negative portray
al of Israelis in the world media bv labeling
them child killers.
The reason so many c hildren are being

killed is that their parents and FA militia
men cynically use them as shields to protect
themselves from Israeli soldiers as they
themselves fire at the Jews. For every child
killed in the line of lire, the PA gives $2,000
to that child's family.
Are these the same Palestinian "freedom
lighters" that Beinin so lovingly embraces?
They indeed are!
At one point in his diatribe, Beinin
equated Israel's treatment of the Arabs to
the Nazis' treatment of the Jews during the
I lolocaust. This spurious claim is not only a
severe insult to the intelligence of any ratio
nal human being, but it also tarnishes the
memories of hundreds of my relatives who
perished in the gas chamlxTS, ghettos, fir
ing squads and concentration camps of
Nazi Europe.
Though Beinin's shocking comments
were greeted by a small but loud chorus of
"boo"s, there were no other speakers at this
teach-in to refute his claim.
1 do not blame Professor Beinin for not
providing another professor to present a
different viewpoint at this teach-in. Beinin
simply exploited the ill-organized History
Department to provide him with .in official
forum fi>r his stilted, one-sided personal
views regarding Israel.
The person at fault in this case is the
organizer of the teach-in, Mary Louise
Roberts. In response to students complain
ing of one-sidedness in the presentation,
Roberts said th.it she fell the non anti-Zion
ist students "seemed to be holding their
own." After the teach-in, she justified her
narrow choice of presenters, claiming that
one Jew and one Arab sufficiently span the
spectrum of viewpoints on the Palestinian
rioting in Israel. As a member of the facul
ty at a s< h<k>l that ranks among the best in
the world, Roberts should know better
than to make a statement like that.
To use an analog) that Beinin stated in
his Israel-bashing speech, it is not the bull's
limit for destroying the china in the china
shop, it is the shop owner's fault for letting
the bull in. Beinin is that bull, and Roberts
is that shop owner.
Had 1 not known better, I would sav
that choosing only one person, with a very
slanted and racist outlook, to speak about
anything on anv sort of panel would be an
honest mistake which anv uninformed,
unworldly and uneducated person could
make. However, I do know better. Roberts
knows full well that Beinin has a viewpoint
embraced by an unbelievably small minor
ity of Jews, and ignorant ones at that.
Roberts has worked with Beinin lor years,

and should know well enough that his per
spective is severely tainted by a fanatically
anti-Israel bias.
It is a cruel time when, less than 60 years
after the attempted annihilation of the Jew
ish people, the world continues to turn its
back on the Jews who are struggling to sur
vive in the only place they know of as
home.
This university, like other universities,
bears the responsibility for spawning and
shaping the intellects of the future. It is sad
that Stanford's History Department choos
es to use its power to brainwash and pro
gram the world's most intelligent youths by
misrepresenting and falsifying so painful a
history as that of Israel.
Whatever its agenda may Ik-, I can only
hope that reason and truth will prevail.
Lx'ave the Jews alone. Is 0 million not
enough?

ASSU financially independent from
University and students
In an article on the ASSU president and
vice president in List Wednesday's Daily
("Taking the Reins"), Colleen O'Brien
wrote, "()ther students are aware that their
money goes to the ASSU, but unsure of how
it is used, junior Steve kalogeras said, It
seems like a major cash cow of the Univer
sity. I wish I knew better how to access it. "
I his statement perpetuates a misunder
standing commonly held by members of
the Stanford community: The ASSU is
financially supported by student fees. This
is not true.

Every student will find on their Univer
sity bill a line for "ASSU Fees." These tees
are the special fees that students vote on
ever)' year in the Spring general election.
These fees support student groups — not
one dollar noes to support the activities of
theASSU.
The ASSU is completely financially
independent from the University. The
ASSU budget is funded by an endowment,
which is comprised of the retained earnings
of its business arm, Stanford Student Enter
prises. Neither the University, nor the stu
dent body, contribute to the annual ASSU
budget.
Every student has the opportunity to
refund their fees: simply visit the ASSU
Web site. However, every student should
understand that, by requesting a refund,
you are withdrawing your financial sup
port from student groups, not from the
ASSU. Further, by requesting a refund,
you are forfeiting your ability to participate
in services, benefits or events provided by
these groups.
Finally, I want to point out that the Stan
ford Guardian, a group currently flyering
campus, is guilty of misleading students.
Requesting a fee refund has no efiect on
the ASSU, it only afiects student groups
who receive special fees.
If you would like to learn more about

Students find presentation of
Israeli / Palestinian conflict biased
Wednesday's histor) department
teach-in, while offering to provide a "liis
torical perspective" on the current "cri
sis" in the Middle l-.ast. provided only an
ami-Israeli platlorm lot the attending
students. Ihe History Department was
irresponsible in failing to provide a bal
anced perspective on the volatile and
pertinent issue of Palestinian / Israeli
confrontation. The lopsided panel choice
limited the scope of instruction to a
biased set ol claims, grievances and his
torical perspective.
I he department's choice of panelists
was deceptive. Ebrahim Moosa, a Muslim
professor of Islamic thought, was chosen
to present "the significance of Jerusalem
in the Muslim conception." One would
have assumed that his counterpart on the
panel, (oel Bcinin, a Jewish professor of
Middle-Eastern history, was chosen to
present the significiance of Jerusalem in
the Jewish religious perspective.
Instead, Bcinin was chosen to present
a historical account of the struggle. In
effect, the panel lacked anyone to present
the supreme importance that Jerusalem
holds lor Jews. Furthermore, Beinin's his
toi \ was highly selective, decisively anti-
Zionist and hostile toward Israel.

Professor Bcinin revealed his overt
hostility in a remark in which he implied
that Jews' mistreatment of Palestinians is
an imperfect form of trauma-driven re
enactment of Nazi mistreatment of Jews.
Such a statement itifantilizes and demo
ni/cs Israel, negating its existence as a
rational entity with well-founded claims
and thoughtfully motivated actions.
Jewish students in the audience were
rightfully a (Iron ted. Professor Mary Lou
Roberts asserted that student comments
could provide the perspective missing in
the panel. However, students cannot
articulate that perspective with the same
c redibility and preparedness of Prolessor
Bcinin. Ihe panelists commanded the
respect commensurate to esteemed facul
ty, set the agenda for discussion and
came prepared with statements and a
lifetime's study.
The teach-in represents a valuable
opportunity squandered. It could have
informed students on the complexities of
an issue that affects us all. Instead, the
History Department presented an
incomplete perspective that reinforces
the distance and misunderstanding on
the issue between Jews and Muslims.
There cannot be a meaningful discussion
about the current crisis on this campus il
the collective understanding of its history
is stilted.

Firstly, two Israeli soldiers were killed by
their Palestinian Authority counterparts
one day before Sharon's infamous visit.
Secondly, Beinin failed to mention the
numerous instances of incitement to vio
lence and murder propagated over Pales
tinian Authority-run radio and television,
also prior to Sharon's visit. This proposed
popular uprising against Israel was set to
begin on Rosh I tashanna, a Jewish holiday.
Sharon's visit to the Old City of Jerusalem
coincided with their planned intifada and
was used by the bloodthirsty PA as an
excuse to the international community for
murder.
The following information was obtained
from the Jerusalem Post, a highly respect
ed and widely read newspaper in Israel
acclaimed for its objectivity. The Palestinian
Authority, a government constructed to
further the interests of the Palestinian peo
ple, instructs its people to violently murder
and injure as many Israelis as possible,
promising a place in heaven to all martyrs.
1 lie promises of the PA extend beyond
the immaterial realm, however. In a recent
statement to its people, the PA encouraged
Palestinians to send their children into the
line of fire to increase the negative portray
al of Israelis in the world media bv labeling
them child killers.
The reason so many c hildren are being

killed is that their parents and FA militia
men cynically use them as shields to protect
themselves from Israeli soldiers as they
themselves fire at the Jews. For every child
killed in the line of lire, the PA gives $2,000
to that child's family.
Are these the same Palestinian "freedom
lighters" that Beinin so lovingly embraces?
They indeed are!
At one point in his diatribe, Beinin
equated Israel's treatment of the Arabs to
the Nazis' treatment of the Jews during the
I lolocaust. This spurious claim is not only a
severe insult to the intelligence of any ratio
nal human being, but it also tarnishes the
memories of hundreds of my relatives who
perished in the gas chamlxTS, ghettos, fir
ing squads and concentration camps of
Nazi Europe.
Though Beinin's shocking comments
were greeted by a small but loud chorus of
"boo"s, there were no other speakers at this
teach-in to refute his claim.
1 do not blame Professor Beinin for not
providing another professor to present a
different viewpoint at this teach-in. Beinin
simply exploited the ill-organized History
Department to provide him with .in official
forum fi>r his stilted, one-sided personal
views regarding Israel.
The person at fault in this case is the
organizer of the teach-in, Mary Louise
Roberts. In response to students complain
ing of one-sidedness in the presentation,
Roberts said th.it she fell the non anti-Zion
ist students "seemed to be holding their
own." After the teach-in, she justified her
narrow choice of presenters, claiming that
one Jew and one Arab sufficiently span the
spectrum of viewpoints on the Palestinian
rioting in Israel. As a member of the facul
ty at a s< h<k>l that ranks among the best in
the world, Roberts should know better
than to make a statement like that.
To use an analog) that Beinin stated in
his Israel-bashing speech, it is not the bull's
limit for destroying the china in the china
shop, it is the shop owner's fault for letting
the bull in. Beinin is that bull, and Roberts
is that shop owner.
Had 1 not known better, I would sav
that choosing only one person, with a very
slanted and racist outlook, to speak about
anything on anv sort of panel would be an
honest mistake which anv uninformed,
unworldly and uneducated person could
make. However, I do know better. Roberts
knows full well that Beinin has a viewpoint
embraced by an unbelievably small minor
ity of Jews, and ignorant ones at that.
Roberts has worked with Beinin lor years,

and should know well enough that his per
spective is severely tainted by a fanatically
anti-Israel bias.
It is a cruel time when, less than 60 years
after the attempted annihilation of the Jew
ish people, the world continues to turn its
back on the Jews who are struggling to sur
vive in the only place they know of as
home.
This university, like other universities,
bears the responsibility for spawning and
shaping the intellects of the future. It is sad
that Stanford's History Department choos
es to use its power to brainwash and pro
gram the world's most intelligent youths by
misrepresenting and falsifying so painful a
history as that of Israel.
Whatever its agenda may Ik-, I can only
hope that reason and truth will prevail.
Lx'ave the Jews alone. Is 0 million not
enough?

ASSU financially independent from
University and students
In an article on the ASSU president and
vice president in List Wednesday's Daily
("Taking the Reins"), Colleen O'Brien
wrote, "()ther students are aware that their
money goes to the ASSU, but unsure of how
it is used, junior Steve kalogeras said, It
seems like a major cash cow of the Univer
sity. I wish I knew better how to access it. "
I his statement perpetuates a misunder
standing commonly held by members of
the Stanford community: The ASSU is
financially supported by student fees. This
is not true.

Every student will find on their Univer
sity bill a line for "ASSU Fees." These tees
are the special fees that students vote on
ever)' year in the Spring general election.
These fees support student groups — not
one dollar noes to support the activities of
theASSU.
The ASSU is completely financially
independent from the University. The
ASSU budget is funded by an endowment,
which is comprised of the retained earnings
of its business arm, Stanford Student Enter
prises. Neither the University, nor the stu
dent body, contribute to the annual ASSU
budget.
Every student has the opportunity to
refund their fees: simply visit the ASSU
Web site. However, every student should
understand that, by requesting a refund,
you are withdrawing your financial sup
port from student groups, not from the
ASSU. Further, by requesting a refund,
you are forfeiting your ability to participate
in services, benefits or events provided by
these groups.
Finally, I want to point out that the Stan
ford Guardian, a group currently flyering
campus, is guilty of misleading students.
Requesting a fee refund has no efiect on
the ASSU, it only afiects student groups
who receive special fees.

Students find presentation of
Israeli / Palestinian conflict biased
Wednesday's histor) department
teach-in, while offering to provide a "liis
torical perspective" on the current "cri
sis" in the Middle l-.ast. provided only an
ami-Israeli platlorm lot the attending
students. Ihe History Department was
irresponsible in failing to provide a bal
anced perspective on the volatile and
pertinent issue of Palestinian / Israeli
confrontation. The lopsided panel choice
limited the scope of instruction to a
biased set ol claims, grievances and his
torical perspective.
I he department's choice of panelists
was deceptive. Ebrahim Moosa, a Muslim
professor of Islamic thought, was chosen
to present "the significance of Jerusalem
in the Muslim conception." One would
have assumed that his counterpart on the
panel, (oel Bcinin, a Jewish professor of
Middle-Eastern history, was chosen to
present the significiance of Jerusalem in
the Jewish religious perspective.
Instead, Bcinin was chosen to present
a historical account of the struggle. In
effect, the panel lacked anyone to present
the supreme importance that Jerusalem
holds lor Jews. Furthermore, Beinin's his
toi \ was highly selective, decisively anti-
Zionist and hostile toward Israel.

Professor Bcinin revealed his overt
hostility in a remark in which he implied
that Jews' mistreatment of Palestinians is
an imperfect form of trauma-driven re
enactment of Nazi mistreatment of Jews.
Such a statement itifantilizes and demo
ni/cs Israel, negating its existence as a
rational entity with well-founded claims
and thoughtfully motivated actions.
Jewish students in the audience were
rightfully a (Iron ted. Professor Mary Lou
Roberts asserted that student comments
could provide the perspective missing in
the panel. However, students cannot
articulate that perspective with the same
c redibility and preparedness of Prolessor
Bcinin. Ihe panelists commanded the
respect commensurate to esteemed facul
ty, set the agenda for discussion and
came prepared with statements and a
lifetime's study.
The teach-in represents a valuable
opportunity squandered. It could have
informed students on the complexities of
an issue that affects us all. Instead, the
History Department presented an
incomplete perspective that reinforces
the distance and misunderstanding on
the issue between Jews and Muslims.
There cannot be a meaningful discussion
about the current crisis on this campus il
the collective understanding of its history
is stilted.

I am writing in response to the "teach
in" on the current situation in the Middle-
East that occurred in the History Corner
on Wednesday. As many may know, the
discussion was sponsored by the History
department and led by History Prof. Joel
Beinin and Religious Studies Prof.
Ibrahim Moosa.
I he discussion was set up in the single
most one-sided manner of any event that
1 have attended while at Stanford. The
panelists' presentations began with Pro
lessor Moosa describing the importance
ol Jerusalem for Muslims and continued
with a vitriolic diatribe by Professor
Beinin in which he basically made a veiled
argument against the very right of the
state ol Israel to exist.
I hroughout his comments, Beinin
made no attempt to maintain even the
slightest notions of historical objectivity as
he even implicitly equated the actions that
Israel has taken over the past 50 years to
the Holocaust that Na/i tiermany commit
ted against the Jews.
For an event that was hilled by the His
tory department as a fair and even-handed
discussion <>1 the Middle East's current cri
sis, the panelists' presentations were deeply
disturbing. At no time did the History
Department attempt to provide its students
and the community at large with a Jewish
or Israeli perspective on the issue. Even
more disturbingly, the department made
almost no effort to distance itself from the
extremist viewpoints espoused by Professor
Beinin.
1 would ask that the University in gen
eral, and the 1 listory Department in partic
ular, do three specific things to correct the
dearly biased nature of this event:
1) Issue a public apology on behalf of the
department in order to restore its reputa
tion for academic excellence.
2) Initiate a follow-up panel discussion in
which the viewpoints of all sides, including
traditional Jewish and Israeli ones can be
fairly heard.
3) Begin a search fora qualified and even
handed expert on the Middle East to coun
terbalance Professor Beinin's extremist
agenda.
ARIKI RATNER
Junior, History
The "Mideast Crisis Teach-In" on
Wednesday was not an "exchange of
ideas," as advertised. Had the event been
labeled " The Palestinian View of Israel," I
would not be upset about it. Yet, I find it
disgraceful that the history department
attempted to pass oil this affair as anything
but a propaganda platform for
anti-Zionists.
Professor Ebrahim Moosa presented a
very interesting and informative speech
about the religious significance of the old
city of Jerusalem to the Muslim faith.
Unfortunately, this was followed by a
severely biased account of events leading
up to the recent Palestinian riots in Israel,
presented by a sell-proclaimed expert on
Middle-Eastern history.
This "historian," Prof. Joel Beinin, pre
sented a very narrow interpretat ion of bits
and pieces of the Arab-Israeli conflict. He
claimed that, in 1929, the Jews of Hebron,
a city in what was then called Palestine, pro

voked their Arab neighbors by flying a flag
with a Star of David on it. Beinin claimed
this "horrifying act" justified the wave of
gruesome Arab pogroms that followed,
during which Arabs killed more than 60
Jews, forcing the Jews to flee the peaceful
communities in which they worked side by
side with their Arab neighbors.
Similarly, Beinin willfully neglected to
mention the long and bloody history of
Palestinian barbarism against the Jews of
Israel, ranging from the massacre of
Olympic athletes in Munich to that of
kindergarteners in the c ity of Ma'a lot.
In his desperate effort to paint the Pales
tinians as innocent lambs, he ignored the
most shocking ac ts of violence perpetrated
by the PLC): the violence it inflic ted against
fellow Palestinians during the "Intifada"
uprising of the 1980s.
Following the same pattern of "selective
history," Beinin asserted that Israeli Knes
set member Ariel Sharon's visit to the Tem
ple Mount "provoked" the violent Pales
tinian riots of the past two weeks.
Unfortunately, there was no other pro
lessor on the panel at the "teach-in" to
include some pertinent facts that really
explain the violence of the past few weeks.
Firstly, two Israeli soldiers were killed by
their Palestinian Authority counterparts
one day before Sharon's infamous visit.
Secondly, Beinin failed to mention the
numerous instances of incitement to vio
lence and murder propagated over Pales

popular uprising against Israel was set to

and injure as many Israelis as possible,
