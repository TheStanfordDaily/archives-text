### KEYA JAYARAM 
Ever heard of a dry fraternity?
Well, not only is it alcohol free — Alpha Phi
()mega is coeducational too.
Alpha Phi ()mega is a nationally organized service
fraternity, with additional international chapters lo
cated in the Philippines, Australia and (Canada, and is
currently gearing up for the school year's ac tivities,
including celebrating its 75th anniversary.
This group differs from traditional Greek organi
zations in that it focuses mainly on philanthropy and
community service.
"We strive to make our campuses, communities
and countries better places in which lo live while nur
turing the potential that lies within each one of us to
lead and serve," said president Terence Cliia, a
sophomore.
Alpha I'lii Omega is a well-established fraternity,
with chapters distributed over 350 college campuses
nationwide, and boasts more than 300,000 initiated
members. Some notable Alpha Phi ()mega alumni in
clude former Secretary of the Arm) logo West, pro
fessional basketball player Bob Love, astronaut Jim
Lovell, comedian Tim Allen and President Bill
Clinton.
However, lor sophomore Lisa Hill, the distin
guished index of past participants was not the frater
nity's most enticing aspect.
"Alpha Phi ()mega provided a fun, painless way to
get involved in service and develop leadership skills."
I fill said.
Some of the group's past projects include volun
teering in soup kite hens, visiting nursing home resi
dents, aiding the construction of children's play
grounds, trick-or-treating for canned goods, partici
pating m national limdraising initiatives and provid

ing disaster reliel assistance.
Upperclassmen may remember the "Ugly Mai on
Campus (UMC)C)," the most widely publicized of
Alpha I'lii Omega's campus events. The Stanford
community nominates several candidates, often in
cluding the Tree and faculty members. Students then
donate money toward the candidate they believe is
Stanford's ugliest person. The contestant who re
ceives the most donations wins the title.
"The history [of the event| extends at least baik
to the early 19505," explained chemistry master's
student Chris Stromberg, who was an Alpha l'n
Omega as an undergraduate. "Most chapter
around the country do some sort of variation on
UMOC."
In both 19% and 1997, the contest raised ovet
$1,000 in charitable funds, donated to the (children'
Wish Foundation in 1996 and Inn Vision of Santi
Clara in 1997. The group intends to organize ;
UMOC competition in the spring of 2001, but deli
nite details are not yet available.
1 hough Alpha I'hi Omega revolves around phil
anthropy, it is the social aspect that keeps it strong, ac
cording to (-hia. This is where the (ireek roots of tin
group are most inlluential.
"The strength ofbeing (ireek is in the definition o
fraternity," Chia said. "In many ways, friendship i:
one of the best lor ms of service a person can provide
both to his friends and the community. It all come:
down to brotherhood and unity."'
Fraternity s<»cial events include a Sectional Conler
ence twice yearly, according to Stromberg, "give us;
c hance to meet, talk with and share ideas from broth
ers all over."
In addition, there are weekly meetings, a retrea
for new pledges, trips to San Francisco, study-breal
dinners, pool nights and just general hanging out.
"I think having clone good together lor the worlc
around us is great lor bonding," I (ill said.
Alpha I'hi Omega will hold an informational ses
sion on Tuesday at 8:30 p.m. in Tresidder Cypres
South. For mote information, e-mail the group <i
