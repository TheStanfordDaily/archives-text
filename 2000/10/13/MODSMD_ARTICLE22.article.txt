# Students celebrate Indigenous Day

### NICOLE WRIGHT 
Both American Indian and
non-Native students gathered
Monday fora dinner and c andle
light vigil celebrating Indige
nous People's Day.
Although the 30-person
turnout for the vigil was smaller
than desired by its organizers,
indigenous campus groups con
sidered the event a success and
lauded the evening as a small yet
significant step toward increased
student awareness of their pres
ence on campus.
"[ 1 he event] was definitely
worth it. It was nice to see not just
Native students but other stu
dents also," said Theresa
Downey, a junior.
" There were only SO or so peo
ple {at the vigil], but those 30
people stood out in the rain for an
hour and gave the speakers a
chance to be heard," said
Downey.
Winona Simms, director of
the American Indian, Alaska Na
tive and Native Hawaiian Pro
gram, echoed the idea tli.it the
event "gave students a chance to
air their feelings." She also ex
plained that the* program provid
ed a chance to reflect on indige
nous history.
"It brings me closer to my par
ents, who were not allowed to
speak their own language as stu
dents. For [Native] students here,
experiences like this are [more
removed].
Many states celebrated Mon
day as C Columbus Day.
The dinner let students appre
ciate the Native perspective, and
see things differently from the
Columbus perspective," said
Simms.
In an effort to expose more
students to this viewpoint, Denni
Woodward, assistant director of
the American Indian, Alaska Na

tive and Native Hawaiian Pro
gram, created an Indigenous
People's history exhibit on
Tresidder Union's second floor
that includes photos and a time
line in conjunction with Mon
day's programs and other up
coming events.
"We are trying to gain a high
er profile on campus," Wood
ward said.
1 fie night's small turnout
showed that gaining more cam
pus recognition c ould be difficult,
Downey said.
"I wish that more people
would have come," she said. "I
think Stanford needs to inform
the student body better [about
Native issues], especially since the
University was built on
Muwekmah-( )hlone land."
Indigenous People's Day was
first celebrated at the 1077 Unit
ed Nations-sponsored Interna
tional Conference on Discrimina
tion Against Indigenous Popula
tions in the Americas in Ceneva,
Switzerland.
The idea resonated with Na
tive communities, who view
Columbus as a tyrant who "per
sonally invented European Im
perialism in the Americas [when
lie enslaved the Taino Indians
after his 1492 voyage]," accord
ing to Resistance 500, an Indige
nous activist group.
However, not until 1992, the
500 th Anniversary of Columbus'
voyage, did the Stanford Ameri
can Indian Organization push to
institute the day as a replace
ment for the celebration of
Columbus Day.
Native Indian peoples orga
nized coalitions, such as the Bay
Area Indian Alliance, and suc
cessfully persuaded local cities
such as Berkeley, Santa Cruz,
San Francisco and Sebastopal to
drop Columbus Day or ratify In
digenous People's Day.-
