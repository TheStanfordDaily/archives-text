## Balls out: Stanford, Cal take to the pitch Men trying to keep focus as Bears stumble to Farm 
### ALEX BENJAMIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When an opponent has noth
ing to lose and everything to gain,
it is time to be concerned. Sun
day's game against California at
New Maloney Field is just that lor
the Stanibrd men's soccer team,
which beat Santa Clara 2-0
tonight at home.
i ()nly a year ago, Cal just missed
a spot in the NCAA Tournament
with a record of 12-5-3. But in the
offseason, the Golden Beats lost
seven-year head coach Mark Mal
lon and graduated 11 letterwin

tiers, including eight starters. As a
result, the team has struggled to a
disappointing 2-8-1 record thus
far. This is what teams refer to as a
rebuilding year.
Despite how the game may look
on paper. No. 1 1 Stanibrd (10-1-1)
is not looking past its rival.
"(lal is a game which we need no
motivation for," said junior de
lender Taylor Graham. "There is
an intense rivalry between us and
in the past couple of years they
have proved that they are a I.dent
ed squad. I his year's record is very
misleading because they have
played some really challenging

teams, [but| it is gois •<> tome
down to the team wh</fefends bet
ter."
Despite such loss*. (-al, led by
first-year head pach Kevin
Grimes, still brings squad of tal
ented players to Jjmday's game.
Of the few returi/ig players, the
Golden Bears dc/iave last year's
top four goal including
senior forward Kendall Sim
monds, who is tf'd for the lead in
goals this year.

three goals pave him tied with
