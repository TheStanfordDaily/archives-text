Colden Bears Sunday at I p.m. in Berkeley will be
no exception.
In fact, with both the Cardinal (8-3-1, 1-1-0 Pacific
10 Conference) and the Colden Bears (11-1-1, 1-1-0)
ranked among the top teams in the conference and in
the nation, this big Game could have serious confer
ence and playoff implications. Both teams sit among
the leaders in the conference after opening Pac-10
play last weekend with wins over Washington State

and losses to Washington. Adding to the already ele< -
trie atmosphere lhat always surrounds this game, this
year's contest will lx- televised b\ Fox Sports B.iv Area

tournament.
"li is important for us to stay on
I lie right track during the final
stretch of the regular season, not
only to try to win the conference, but
also to prepare so that we can peak
at tournament time," said senior
midfielder Celina DeLeon.
Smolak will need to continue to
play well in order to stop Cal's po

tent offense. Led by sophomore
striker Laura Schott, who has tallied
the Bears' last seven goals and who
ranks second nationally in goals per
game, Cal has outscored opponents
21-1 at home, where they are a per
fect 5-0 this year. Between the posts,
senior goalkeeper Maite Zabala has
a 0.66 goals against average.
"The thing about California is
that they are good all over the
field," said Stanford head coach
Andy Nelson.
The Cardinal will counter with
freshman forward Marcie Ward,
who leads the Pac-10 and ranks fifth
nationally with 11 assists on the year.
Ward has been hot of late, tallying

seven assists in the last eight games.
Ward's counterpart up front,
sophomore Marcia Wallis, and the
rest of the Cardinal's offensive
weapons will have to be in top form
in order to penetrate the Bears
stingy defense, which has allowed
only seven goals all season.
According to Nelson, the ke\s
to Stanford's success will be taking
advantage of its opportunities
and defending well against the
Bears' attack.
The Cardinal is well prepared,
however. Nelson says the team has
tightened up defensively in the p.isi
few weeks, led In junior defender
.\mv Sauer and Smolak, who is just

two saves away from tying Stan
ford's single-season mark of (>B.
Smolak has a 0.87 goals against av
erage .md has allowed just 1 1 goals
all season.
Stanford holds a slight edge in
the all-time series between the two
teams (8-7-2), but Cal has won the
last two meetings in dramatic over
time fashion. Ihe last four games
between the two teams have each
been dec ided by just one goal. All of
these games were characterized by
physical battles, with (la I trying to in
timidate and disrupt Stanford's
rhythmic passing style of play.
"We must be able to match their
physical pressure and impose our

style of play on them in order to be
successful, " said fifth-year senior
and co-captain Sliauna Itri.
With only one game this week
end, both teams have been able to
focus on the strengths and weak
nesses of just one opponent. In a
matc hup between the Cardinal and
the Bears, this week of waiting raises
the already high intensity level to an
even greater level.
"We have had a great week of
practice and 1 think we are reach
and excited to compete on Sundav.
We know what to expect from them;
we just need to come out hard and
play to our p< Hernial," said seni< >ra>-
captain Christy LaPierre.
