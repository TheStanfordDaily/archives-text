# Card looks to spark sluggish offense
## 
### MATT LONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I he Stanford fi h)tball machine seems to
lx- running on only three cylinders. The
defense stifles opponents, giving the of
fense the opportunity to come away with
the victory. But I he offense has struggled to
find its spark and put up the points need
ed to soar past its opponent.
Saturday, the vastly improved Cardi
nal defense will square off on the road
against No. 20 Oregon State's offensive
powerhouse. Stanford (2-3, 1-1 Pacific 10
Conference) needs to establish its defen
sive presence early or the Beavers' (4-1,
1-1) explosive oflense will set the tone for
another high scoring rampage, one that
the Cardinal offensive unit may lx- ill
prepared to match.
Redshirt freshman quarterback Chris
Ixwis will start his third straight game in
place of the injured Randy Fasani and
looks to continue his improvement and se
cure his spot in the rotation upon Fasani's
imminent return.
Fasani went down Sept. 16 against
Texas and suffered a potentially season

ending knee injury. But aftersurgery ii
appears Fasani may be back in action as
early as this weekend, though he is listed
as doubtful.
"Randy is a tremendous competitor,"
said Willingham. "His will is tremendous.
His attitude is extremely positive. It's
ama/.ing, when you have all that working
for you, how fast you can heal. But I don't
know if it's this weekend."
The Beavers' main weapon is senior
tailback Ken Simonton, who is averaging
163 yards and two touchdowns a game.
Oregon State has been the surprise of
the Pac-10 thus far, posting a key 31-21
win over USC on Sept. 30, a game in
which Simonton amassed 234 yards and
three touchdowns.
"I think he's different [than any back
we've faced]," said Stanford head coach
Tyrone Willingham. "1 think the term that
you'll probably see applied to Simonton a
lot is'downhill'. He is very determined and
very good."
Fortunately for the Cardinal, its defen
sive play is superb of late, and with a tal
ented line it can look to, if not stop, at least
contain Oregon State's rushing attack. In

fact, the Stanford defense Ikis improved
in almost even statistical category from
last season. In 1999, the C ardinal allowed
32 points a game. This year, the\ have
held opponents to an average of just IS
points and 100 yards less pei game than
last season.
"We're a lot more consistent than last
year," said All-l'ac-10 linebacker Riall
Johnson. "We're not giving up as main
big plays and we're slowing down of
fenses. I think out intensity is higher
than last year."
Willingham wants Stanford to locus
on the run early and count on |ohnson
and Ail-American defensive tackle Willie
I loward to penetrate and wreak havoc in
the hackfield.
But ()regon State can take to the air as
well with junior quarterback |onathan
Smith and a talented receiving corps. In
a 3.H-30 loss last week at No. 10 Washing
ton, Smith tallied 31 I yards passing and
three touchdowns.
"I think what we will start the hallgame
thinking is we need to find a wa\ to stop

defense have held opponents to an average of just 1 points per game.
that runner [Simonton]; limit what
he can do," said Willingham.
"That's impressive, when you can
put together a 100-yard rusher and
a couple 100-yard receivers."
The Beavers average 29 points a
game. Last year that would not have
been a problem for the Cardinal's
potent offense. But this season,
Stanford has not yet scored 29
points in any game. So in order to
win, offensive production will lx j
key for the Cardinal.
Oregon State head coach
Dennis Erickson said the Stan
ford offense has tremendous po
tential, and should challenge the
Beaver defense.
"They've got two really great
running backs in Brian Allen and
Kerry Carter, who lx>th played well
against us last year and had suc
cess," Erickson said.
Stanford beat the Beavers 21-17
last year behind junior Allen's 99
yards on the ground in just nine car
ries. The run may be the Cardinal's
best option against an ()regon State
defense that allowed Washington to
rush for 281 yards.
