### EZRA CALLAHAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
llallwa\ through iis Pacific 10 Confer
ence schedule, the Stanford women's
volleyball team (10-6, .">-1 Pac-10) is cer
tainh not where it expected to be at the
beginning ol the season. At No. 21 in the
national rankings, one might expect the
Cardinal squad to be concerned with its
present standing.
Hut this group is immutably optimistic
.uul with vei \ good reason. This is not
the same Stanlord team tli.it started the
season.
1 he return ol sophomore All-Ameri
can Logan lom to the lineup has
( hanged the lace ol this team drastically
as it heads into the second half of the sea

felt, tallying 1 7 kills in her first match for
the (.ardinal this season.
1 he:')-() sweep oyer California Tues
day gave the Cardinal its third straight
l\ic-10 victory.
"Just in the last two days (since loin's
i elurn) there seems to be a different light
and air on the court," said interim head
coach Denise Corlett. "She brings confi
dence to the team, and people are more
relaxed with her out there on the court.
She just lias a presence."
I om s impact on the team will be test
ed this weekend as the ( 'animal faces No.

ference match tomorrow at 7 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion.
I om's dc( ision to plav this season im
mcdiateh gave the team the go-to player
ii had been lacking and been preparing
to pla\ without for the remainder of the
season. I mil I uesdax s match, it was un

season, having jiisi returned to the Farm
after plaving lor the I .S. National team
at the ()lvmpics in Sydne\.
I he Cardinal is still in the process of
adjusting to having lom back on the
team. Corlett lias shnflled her lineup
often this season, taking advantage of
her team's depth and strong group of
freshmen. But ha\ing loin on the roster
adds a new twist.

"We're trying to find the best position
for Logan to lit in that will maximize her
and the rest of the team," Corlett said.
"()ther teams w ill be keying on her, so we
need the best lineup so they can key on
her and we can get the rest of the team
the best opportunities."
Finding such a lineup has been get
ting easier for Corlett, as several key
players have started turning out consis
tently strong performances.
Senior middle blocker Jennifer Det
mer, who also missed much ol the early
season, has played extremely strong at
the net recently, running up 2.H blocks in
the Cardinal's last three matches. Fresh
man Sara McGee has also turned out
some strong play in the middle the past
three matches, racking up at least live
blocks and double-digit kills.
Junior Tara Conrad has settled into
the outside-bitter position nicely, after
starting the season at middle blocker.
Conrad tallied a career-high 24 kills
against Washington State last Friday,
adding 15 more the next night against
Washington.
Sophomore outside hitler Ashley Ivy
has also boosted the Cardinal offense,
posting 14 kills and a team-high nine
digs in the Stanford victory over Cal.
" I think we have a clearer vision of ex
actly the kind of team we can be," said
team captain Lindsay Kagawa. "We
know Logan's going to play, we have
people getting comfortable into their
spots, the freshmen are more integrated
into the team. It all makes us more com
fortable on the court."
Long Beach has been playing weil re
cently after getting off to a pool start this
season. Following a dreadful 1-3 start in
Big West Conference play while plagued
In injuries, the 49ers have rebounded
strongly, w inning their last three mate li
es without dropping a single game.
Long Beach is led by middle bloc kei
Cheryl Weaver, who leads the team with
3.95 kills and 1.58 blocks per game and is
hitting an impressive .307. Flic Cardinal
will also have to watch out lor the wicked
serve of setter Brittany llochevar, who
has racked up 33 aces on the season.
