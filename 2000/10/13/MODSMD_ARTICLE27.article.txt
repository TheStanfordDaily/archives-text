# No. 1 Bruins coming to town

('.< offt w< > heart-breaking
losses to No. ( .) Pacific and No. 5
I (I-Irvine, the Stanford men's
water polo team faces one of its
toughest matches so far this season
against I CLA.
First, Stanlbrd (4-5, 1-!* MPSF)
will have to take on a squad of
alumni in an annual battle Satur
day at noon. After that warmup,
the sixth-ranked Cardinal, shoul
dering one of its lowest rankings
since the early '90's, is set to battle
the top-ranked Bruins in a non
league matchup Sunday at noon
in the Avery Aquatics Complex,
l he Bruins, who first take on Cal
ifornia Saturday in Berkeley, are
taking a live-game winning streak
on the road to the Bay Area.
Though they weren't strug
gling to begin with, the Bruins
have filled out their offense with
the recent addition of 1999 NCAA
player of the Year and 2000

Olympian Sean Kern. Kern lead
the Bruins to a 7-5 victory over
USC last weekend, earning the
title of Mikasa MFSF Men's Water
Polo Player of the Week.
In that game, the Bruins also
displayed their defensive prowess
by holding No. 3 USC to only
three goals before giving up two
meaningless scores in the final
minutes of the game. After scoring
only three goals of its own against
Irvine last weekend, the Stanford
offense should face some tough
competition.
UCLA, however, is not the
only team with Olympic experi
ence. Stanford freshman Tony
Azevedo, an 18-year-old from
Long Beach, got significant play
ing time as the youngest of Kern's
teammates on the sixth-place
U.S. National team.
Despite his much-needed
shooting prowess and his impres
sive resume, Azevedo won't neces
sarily be seeing a lot of action. Be
cause Azevedo has already missed
almost half of Stanford's water
polo season, Dettamanti is unsure
as to whether or not he will red
shirt this season.
"If he plays, he'll play this week

end," Dettamanti saicl. "But if lie
doesn't, he won't play the rest of
I he season."
While many will Ik- waiting lor
Azevedo, the Cardinal has already
pulled in some stellar performances
from sophomores Brian harrow
and Peter Hudnut, the team's top
two scorers this season with 1(> and
14 goals, respectively. Both made
significant contributions this past
weekend as each tallied three goals
against UOPand I nine.
So what will the (Cardinals do to
contain the No. 1 ranked team?
"Be aware of the things they do
well. One thing they do well is they
really counterattack. They'll beat
you down the pool every single
time," Dettamanti said.
While the team has a plan of at
tack, it still comes down to execu
tion. Each player will have to con
tribute if Stanford is to win this
weekend's game against U( 'LA.
"1 think we're playing really
well on defense," Dettamanti saicl.
"We're playing well enough on
defense to win most games. We
need to work on our scoring. I ex
pect them all to perform. Even
though they're young, they're t.it
emed. I mean, it's a good team."
