didates in California — both with
Stanford ties — running for the U.S.
Senate. Today's installment features
Imw Prof. Tom Campbell. Look fora
profile' o] Sen. Dianne Feinstein, '55,

Republicans say they can count
on Rep. Tom Campbell — not to
toe the party line, but to speak his
mind and vote his conscience,
even when it may be at odds with
the Republican Party.
His socially moderate views on
increasing drug treatment pro
grains, supporting legalized abor
tion and strict gun control have

earned Camp
bell a reputation
as a maverick, a
title with which
he feels quite
comlortable.
"1 think most
people in the
Repub 1 i c an
Partv know I'm

going to say
what I think," said Campbell, with
a laugh. "They're used to me."
Campbell lac es an uphill battle
to unseat well-known and widely
popular Democrat, Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, who won the 1992 elec -
tion with the most votes cast lor a
senator in U.S. history. A Field Poll
