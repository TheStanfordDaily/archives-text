# Campbell hopes to topple Feinstein in upcoming election
## 
### LOUISA HANDLE 
Editor's Note: This article is the
first of two profiles looking at the can
didates in California — both with
Stanford ties — running for the U.S.
Senate. Today's installment features
Imw Prof. Tom Campbell. Look fora
profile' o] Sen. Dianne Feinstein, '55,
next week.
Republicans say they can count
on Rep. Tom Campbell — not to
toe the party line, but to speak his
mind and vote his conscience,
even when it may be at odds with
the Republican Party.
His socially moderate views on
increasing drug treatment pro
grains, supporting legalized abor
tion and strict gun control have

earned Camp
bell a reputation
as a maverick, a
title with which
he feels quite
comlortable.
"1 think most
people in the
Repub 1 i c an
Partv know I'm

going to say
what I think," said Campbell, with
a laugh. "They're used to me."
Campbell lac es an uphill battle
to unseat well-known and widely
popular Democrat, Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, who won the 1992 elec -
tion with the most votes cast lor a
senator in U.S. history. A Field Poll


Campbell
released yesterday shows (.amp
bell nailing Feinstein by 20 points
with less ih.in .1 month belore Flec
tion Day. Campbell has the sup
port of :U percent of California
voters, compared to 54 percent lor
Feinstein.
(Campbell s challenge will be to
involve more Caliiornians in the
race that's going on in their own
backyard.
"Mv own polling shows that I'm
receiving Bf> percent support from
those who know my views, said
Campbell, who acknowledges his
name recognition is onl\ half of
Feinstein's.
He plans to increase television
and radio ads and hopes to debate
his opponent. Feinstein, who has
been recovering from a broken leg
since Labor I)a\ weekend, is cur
rently m the process of negotiating
for two debates.
"She agrees in theorv [to the de
bates]," said Campbell. " 'Theory'
must be a small town north ol
Bakersfield."
Although (lampbell shares sim
ilar views on abortion and gun
control with Feinstein. he leels that
much separates him from his
opponent.
"There are huge differences,"
Campbell said, citing Feinstein's
support for the nation's current
domestic drug polic\ and for U.S.
aid for and involvement in
C Colombia.
Campbell introduced a resolu
tion in the I louse of Representa
tives to compel a vote on entering
into wai with Yugoslovia over
Kosovo in 1999. He criticizes Fein
stein for helping to table the reso
lution in the Senate so that she
would not have to be on the record
lor supporting or opposing the
war.
"People should go on record,"
on whether tliev support or op
pose such matters. (lampbell said.
Campbell favors the death
penaltv for adults intentionally

selling heroin, cocaine or metham
phelamine to children under 12.
"11 you're an adult and you sell
heroin, cocaine or methampheta
mine to a child, it is morally and so
cially as culpable as murder," he
said.
I his policy, he believes, would
discourage drug dealers from tar
geting grade schools by making
the risks too great.
A strong proponent of Proposi
tion 3(>, the initiative for probation
and drug treatment for non-vio
lent first-time ollenders, (lampbell
said, " l lie fundamental and most
important part would increase
money for [drug treatment | slots."
He views drug addiction as a
medical problem and laments the
dearth of spaces available for those
seeking help — 37,000 slots for
some 160,000 Caliiornians addict
ed to heroin, cocaine or meiham
phetamine. Campbell favors
spending two-thirds of the $ 19 bil
lion national drug budget on treat
ment rather than imprisonment.
Campbell also lias other ideas
lor I he reallocation of foreign aid.
As a member of the International
Relations Committee, Campbell
has visited the poorest nations in
the world, including Rwanda, Bu
rundi. Ethiopia, Haiti, Somalia
and Sudan. He said he feels the
I nited States provides too much
economic assistance to Fgypt and
Israel and not enough aid to I bird
World countries.
"1 would redirect it to people in
the poorest countries on earth. I'm
not in favor of giving more money
to the government," Campbell
said. "Mv worry is that very little
would get through."
Instead, he supports agencies
directh involved in the lives ol the
poor, including the Red ( toss,
Doctors Without Borders and
CARE.
While these policies paint
Campbell as socially moderate-lo
liberal. he is liscallv conservative.
He has criticized both Vice-
President A1 Core and Texas Cov.
Ceorge W. Bush for their plans to
spend a budget surplus that may
or ma\ not materialize instead of

focusing on paying off the $5.7 tril
lion national debt. It is criticism
that is well-intentioned, Campbell
said.
"It is wiser to pay back the debt
until we have paid it all back," said
Campbell, who is reluctant to
promise the surplus to permanent
entitlements.
Education is one of the only
areas where Campbell advocates
increased spending at both the
state and federal level.
He voted to increase funding
for fell C irants, which provide fed
eral student aid, and would sup
port using the California budget
surplus toward a school voucher
system aimed at helping children
iu schools performing in the low
est l()th percentile to attend pri
vate schools.
Campbell began teaching an
titrust law at Stanford in 11)83,
earning his tenure in 11)87. Camp
bell lias taught at least one c ourse a
year at Stanford, either at the main
campus or at Stanford in
Washington.
"1 very much hope that I can do
both," said Campbell, on juggling
responsibilities as professor and
senator.
I fe will teach "Antitrust at
Stanford in the January 2001 term
regardless of the results of the elec
tion.
Kevin Driscoll, a second-year
law student, said he is looking for
ward to taking the course with
Campbell. "1 hear he's very knowl
edgeable on the subject."
Balancing the demands of (Con
gress and Stanford li.is been diffi
cult. Former l*iw School Dean Paul
Brest gave Campbell a January
2001 deadline In which to c hoose
Capitol Mill or Stanford. Current
Dean Kathleen Sullivan lias ex
pressed .in intention to uphold that
deadline.
Thus, should Campbell gain a
Senate se.it, he would be forced to
relinquish bis tenure.
C Campbell continues on the cam
paign trail today, appearing on
television this morning in ()akland
before flying to l.os Angeles for
three seperate appearances.

I his policy, he believes, would
discourage drug dealers from tar
geting grade schools by making
the risks too great.
A strong proponent of Proposi
tion 3(>, the initiative for probation
and drug treatment for non-vio
lent first-time ollenders, (lampbell
said, " l lie fundamental and most
important part would increase
money for [drug treatment | slots."
He views drug addiction as a
medical problem and laments the
dearth of spaces available for those
seeking help — 37,000 slots for
some 160,000 Caliiornians addict
ed to heroin, cocaine or meiham
phetamine. Campbell favors
spending two-thirds of the $ 19 bil
lion national drug budget on treat
ment rather than imprisonment.
Campbell also lias other ideas
lor I he reallocation of foreign aid.
As a member of the International
Relations Committee, Campbell
has visited the poorest nations in
the world, including Rwanda, Bu
rundi. Ethiopia, Haiti, Somalia
and Sudan. He said he feels the
I nited States provides too much
economic assistance to Fgypt and
Israel and not enough aid to I bird
World countries.
"1 would redirect it to people in
the poorest countries on earth. I'm
not in favor of giving more money
to the government," Campbell
said. "Mv worry is that very little
would get through."
Instead, he supports agencies
directh involved in the lives ol the
poor, including the Red ( toss,
Doctors Without Borders and
CARE.
While these policies paint
Campbell as socially moderate-lo
liberal. he is liscallv conservative.
He has criticized both Vice-
President A1 Core and Texas Cov.
Ceorge W. Bush for their plans to
spend a budget surplus that may
or ma\ not materialize instead of

focusing on paying off the $5.7 tril
lion national debt. It is criticism
that is well-intentioned, Campbell
said.
"It is wiser to pay back the debt
until we have paid it all back," said
Campbell, who is reluctant to
promise the surplus to permanent
entitlements.
Education is one of the only
areas where Campbell advocates
increased spending at both the
state and federal level.
He voted to increase funding
for fell C irants, which provide fed
eral student aid, and would sup
port using the California budget
surplus toward a school voucher
system aimed at helping children
iu schools performing in the low
est l()th percentile to attend pri
vate schools.
Campbell began teaching an
titrust law at Stanford in 11)83,
earning his tenure in 11)87. Camp
bell lias taught at least one c ourse a
year at Stanford, either at the main
campus or at Stanford in
Washington.
"1 very much hope that I can do
both," said Campbell, on juggling
responsibilities as professor and
senator.
I fe will teach "Antitrust at
Stanford in the January 2001 term
regardless of the results of the elec
tion.
Kevin Driscoll, a second-year
law student, said he is looking for
ward to taking the course with
Campbell. "1 hear he's very knowl
edgeable on the subject."
Balancing the demands of (Con
gress and Stanford li.is been diffi
cult. Former l*iw School Dean Paul
Brest gave Campbell a January
2001 deadline In which to c hoose
Capitol Mill or Stanford. Current
Dean Kathleen Sullivan lias ex
pressed .in intention to uphold that
deadline.
Thus, should Campbell gain a
Senate se.it, he would be forced to
relinquish bis tenure.
C Campbell continues on the cam
paign trail today, appearing on
television this morning in ()akland
before flying to l.os Angeles for
three seperate appearances.
Editor's Note: This article is the
first of two profiles looking at the can
didates in California — both with
Stanford ties — running for the U.S.
Senate. Today's installment features
Imw Prof. Tom Campbell. Look fora
profile' o] Sen. Dianne Feinstein, '55,
next week.
Republicans say they can count
on Rep. Tom Campbell — not to
toe the party line, but to speak his
mind and vote his conscience,
even when it may be at odds with
the Republican Party.
His socially moderate views on
increasing drug treatment pro
grains, supporting legalized abor
tion and strict gun control have

earned Camp
bell a reputation
as a maverick, a
title with which
he feels quite
comlortable.
"1 think most
people in the
Repub 1 i c an
Partv know I'm

going to say
what I think," said Campbell, with
a laugh. "They're used to me."
Campbell lac es an uphill battle
to unseat well-known and widely
popular Democrat, Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, who won the 1992 elec -
tion with the most votes cast lor a
senator in U.S. history. A Field Poll


Campbell
released yesterday shows (.amp
bell nailing Feinstein by 20 points
with less ih.in .1 month belore Flec
tion Day. Campbell has the sup
port of :U percent of California
voters, compared to 54 percent lor
Feinstein.
(Campbell s challenge will be to
involve more Caliiornians in the
race that's going on in their own
backyard.
"Mv own polling shows that I'm
receiving Bf> percent support from
those who know my views, said
Campbell, who acknowledges his
name recognition is onl\ half of
Feinstein's.
He plans to increase television
and radio ads and hopes to debate
his opponent. Feinstein, who has
been recovering from a broken leg
since Labor I)a\ weekend, is cur
rently m the process of negotiating
for two debates.
"She agrees in theorv [to the de
bates]," said Campbell. " 'Theory'
must be a small town north ol
Bakersfield."
Although (lampbell shares sim
ilar views on abortion and gun
control with Feinstein. he leels that
much separates him from his
opponent.
"There are huge differences,"
Campbell said, citing Feinstein's
support for the nation's current
domestic drug polic\ and for U.S.
aid for and involvement in
C Colombia.
Campbell introduced a resolu
tion in the I louse of Representa
tives to compel a vote on entering
into wai with Yugoslovia over
Kosovo in 1999. He criticizes Fein
stein for helping to table the reso
lution in the Senate so that she
would not have to be on the record
lor supporting or opposing the
war.
"People should go on record,"
on whether tliev support or op
pose such matters. (lampbell said.
Campbell favors the death
penaltv for adults intentionally

selling heroin, cocaine or metham
phelamine to children under 12.
"11 you're an adult and you sell
heroin, cocaine or methampheta
mine to a child, it is morally and so
cially as culpable as murder," he
said.
I his policy, he believes, would
discourage drug dealers from tar
geting grade schools by making
the risks too great.
