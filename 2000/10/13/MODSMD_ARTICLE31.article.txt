"Dancer in the Dark" is the
brainchild of icelandic techno
goddess Bjork and Danish direc
tor Lars von Irier ("Breaking ihe
Waves," " 1 lie Idiots," "Knropa").
The movie, a new-school Molly
wood musical, stars Bjork as
Selma, a Czech immigrant living

with her son in rural America in
the late 19605. The film also in
corporates her songs in flashy
video sequences.
Selma is going blind due to a
hereditary disease that she has
passed on to her young son; she
secretly works long hours at a fac -
tory to save money to secure him
an operation. Meanwhile, Sclma's
vision deteriorates daily and she

continually daydreams colorful
song and dance routines.
Tragedy ensues when an evil cop
betrays her and, in a series ol
quite graphic and intense scenes,
the blind Selma is robbed of her
money, kills a man and is tried for
murder.
The entire movie is founded
on the absurd naivete ol Selma,
which becomes increasingly frus
trating as her circumstances be
come more and more dire. It may
also be the reason tor the ex
tremely naive logic of the script
and the faux-amateur camera
work: the narrative is shot on dig
ital film in a documentary style
that feels sloppy and curiously
voyeuristic, alternating with
song-and-dance numbers com
posed by Bjork and shot with 100
stationary cameras.
The entire film seems fantasti
cally naive, and one wonders il von
Trier did this intentionally to
make it feel more like a traditional
Hollywood musical. Catherine
1 )eneuve appears as Selma's 112 riend
and co-worker, Kathy, and she,

too, serves little purpose in the film
hut to conjure up (hy her presence
alone) the French musicals of her
past. In ;i move characteristic of
the entire film, von Trier uses
Deneuve as a symbol rather than
an actress, rendering her perfor
mance almost irrelevant.
Likewise, Bjork's musical num
bers are far more interesting in
theory than in practice. The film
uses Selma's daydreaming to
segue into the surreal cartoon
logic of the Hollywood dance
number, which basically disguises
the transition from narrative to
music video.
If you love Bjork, these scenes
are enjoyable; if you are ambiva
lent about her, these scenes are
excruciating.
At best, they provide entertain
ing spectacles to accompany
Bjork's voice, but there are plenty
of extremely good Bjork music
videos that have already done a
much better job. The musical se
quences in "Dancer" t.ike very few
risks and harbor few surprises vi
sually: their simplistic editing and

choreography suggest an attempt
to evoke a particular abstract
naive quality.
So was "Dancer in the Dark"
just poorly done? That's the
problem â€” it's hard to know
whether to take the film seriously.
It won the "Palme Dor" and
"Best Female Performance"
awards at Cannes, but does tli.it
in,ike its supreme pretentiousness
any less difficult to swallow? Its
final narrative scenes are ad

inirably haunting, but does that
make up for the extraordinarily
c lumsy integration of the musical
numbers?
Still, somehow there is enough
naked emotion in Seltna's tragedy
that it is difficult to dismiss the
movie entirely. I left the theater
thinking 1 had just seen an ex
tremely depressing European art
film, but I wonder if, in some
