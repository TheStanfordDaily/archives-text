# 'Felicity' offers weekly dose of melodrama
## 
### WENSHIN LEE STAFF WRITER 
"Felicity" heads into its third
season this year and, even though
the show began on the premise ol
a young girl choosing New York
City over Stanford — in part, be
cause of a guy — true fans know
that it wasn't just about a guy.
Well, at least not completely.
After a couple years of "will-they or
won't-they" drama, Felicity and
Ben decide to commit to a serious
relationship. But, in the season pre
miere, the couple realizes that they
may have jumped in too soon and
that moving in together is more
about maturity than romance.
Within minutes of seeing a run
down, hopeless storage closet in
Brooklyn, Felicity decides that it

would be a romantic dream to live
there with Ben for the year. Ben
agrees to move in, but, as soon as
he sees the place, he realizes that
it's not going to be easy to lix and
move around without bumping
into each other — not to mention
the rats, cobwebs and bugs that
have no place to hide.
Felicity ends up giving up the
closet and moving back in with tin
girls, and it is obvious that her re
lationship with Ben is far from sta
ble. On one hand, she still sees
him as the boy she had a crush on
in high school, and on the other,
as the boyfriend who disappoint
ed her over and over again last
year.
Despite the fact that Felicity is
completely into Ben, she seems to
be skating on thin ice, holding on
to the belief that things will work

out. She knows somehow, though,
that it's not going to lie simple or
what she expected — the true
premise of the show, and a mes
sage that is still strong in its third
season.
Your decisions, and the effects
that tumble out of those decisions,
are never what you expect. So she
got the guy and she's livingout the
fantasy she envisioned when she
hopped on that plane to New
York.
However, 1 doubt that she is
satisfied. But 1 also doubt she re
grets going. I doubt she regrets
the last two years of drama, even
the part where she cut her hair
and lost half her viewers (note:
true fans love her just the same).
And I doubt the drama will end
with a happily-ever-after relation
ship with Ben.

So why would a Stanford stu
dent like you enjoy watching the
show? Well, for starters, it's not
what you expect. The show is not
flamboyant; instead, it's ground
ed in simple relationships that
subtly reveal gender conflicts, self
discovery and the battle between
independence and dependence.
"Felicity" continues to build on
each character's emotional past
and the baggage that follows them
to college, l he students are ju
niors now, and their environment
is becoming home in a way that
they probably would not have ex
pected when they first arrived on
campus.
Hopefully this season will con
centrate on the friendships
among the girls: Elena, Felicity,
Megan and Julie. In the season
premiere, they hugged as if they

really missed each other over the
summer, but the friendships have
not been developed thus far on
the show.
Instead of showing the depth
and beauty of female friendships,
the girls seem like a shallow clique
of middle school girls, checking
out the guys and borrowing each
other's make-up.
The friendship between the
guys however, is very well devel
oped. Last year, when Noel was
having problems with his then
girlfriend, Ruby, Ben asked him
to play a game of one-on-one with
the intention of sharing his own
experience and consoling Noel.
There's no better ground for
friendship than a basketball court,
as my brother and I like to say. I
have to admit it made perfect
sense to me.
