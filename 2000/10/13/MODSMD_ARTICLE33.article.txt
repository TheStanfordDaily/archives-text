# Intermission Interview
## Nation building with JT the Bigga, Figga Rapper JT the Bigga Figga drops some wisdom on his new album, 'Something Crucial' 
### H. SAMY ALIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
One of the Bay Area's most popular rap
artists, JT the Bigga Figga, a.k.a. Brother
Joseph Muhammad, has released his latest
solo album, "Something Crucial," on his
own Cet Low Record/ in conjunction with
1)1 A Records. The album features collabo
rations with many Bay Area stars such as
San Quinn, Mac Mall, Yukmouth (lrom the
Luniz), Steady Mobbin', Killa Tay, The
(Gambia/, and more.
Fans bought over 1 ()(),()()() units on the
first day of release, and they consider this
album to be Brother JT's best product yet.
The Bigga Figga's crucial release features
songs like "Another Fpisode," "Fedi Can't
Buy You Love" and "Beware of Those"
that are bound to be hits.
However, "The Hidden Hand," and
"Beating Prophecy," are the highlights of the
alburn. Both songs have been heavily influ
enced by the teachings of the Honorable Fli
jah Muhammad as taught by the Honorable
Minister Louis Farrakhan. In"The Hidden
I land,'' the sixth track on the new album, |T
reveals the truth behind Willie Lynch's
wicked plan. Willie Lynch was a white slave
owner who wrote a document titled "Let's
Make a Slave: The origin and development of
a social being called the 'negro.' " His docu
ment discussed, in a very graphic manner,
how to enslave the minds of Africans and how
to devise and implement several strategies to
keep the enslaved Africans divided so that
they would not rise against the slavemasters.
Brother JT reflects on the song and
breaks down the science behind it:"I tried
to place that song in track number six be
cause six represents the beast. And it rep
resents incompletion, because with the
number six, the head is at the bottom.
When you're complete, the head is at the
top. 'The Hidden Hand' is hidden, you
know what I'm saying? Like Minister Far
rakhan was teaching us about 'The I iidden
Hand' and their plot to do what they have
clone and are doing. So, 'The Hidden
Hand' is something that's an on-going
thing, you just don't see it. So, it gives you
the illusion that nothing is happening. So,
my verse grew out of that meeting where
we talked about Willie Lynch. And Willie
Lynch played a major role in the Hidden
Hand from way back then. How he would
have the slaves fighting and arguing over
their differences and they didn't know
why. But he initiated it."
When asked about his motivation for

writing such a powerful piece, Brother |T
adds: "I wanted to write that song. I knew
that this is what the Minister wanted at the
meeting. I was inspired to write that verse.
It's all from the heart, you know what I'm
saying? This music, man, is a way to wake
these people up."
The meeting Brother JT is referring to
is the historic Rapper's Summit where
Minister Farrakhan met with leaders of the
hip-hop community, such as Snoop Hogg,
Kam, Ice Cube, Common, Coodie Mob,
Chuck I), Too Short, Russell Simmons,
Bone Thugs N Harmony, Fat Joe, Kurupt,
Doug F Fresh, Davey I) and many others.
The summit had a tremendous impact on
Brother JT.
"I'm not supposed to be in this rap game
just trying to please myself. I'm thinking
about the impact it's having on my com
munity, the impact it's having on the Na
tion [of Islam], the impact that it just has on
me, you know. I really started realizing it
when I first started corning to [Mosque #26
on 3rd Street in San Francisco] in '92. Now,
it's 2000 and I can see it even more clearer
that I got a bigger work to do through this
music.
"And Minister Farrakhan confirmed it
even more, too, when we was at his home
on April 3rd, 1997 — about who the rap
pers are. I le said the rappers are the lead
ers. He said we're like the 'pied pipers.' He
didn't want to use that word, but the peo
ple respond to our tune. They're listening
to what we're saying. I Ie was really just let
ting us know that we're put in this position
for (iod's purpose, though, you know what
I'm saying? The Minister said that the rap
pers are the number-one teachers. The
rappers have more influence over the peo
ple, really, than the teachers, preachers,
politicians, the presidents, the mayors; He
said with the exception of himself [laugh
ing]. Let me make that real clear!"
With this spirit in mind, Brother JT,
Brother San Quinn and Brotha John collabo
rated to create one of the most genuine, heart
felt tributes to the power of Islam on "Beating
Prophecy." Brother JT raps:
The Book of Revelations is a mantle in time
And the Holy Qur'an is a book that binds
Every man to his actions, self-accusing spirit
The Messenger delivered the message so we can
hear it
And make a choice to get it right or keep it
wrong
While we battle temptation that's why I'm
singing this song
So beat the prophecy!

Addressing Willie Lynch's prophecy of
the lilack Man's death and destruction,
Brother San Quinn relays a message for
the time. In his words, one hears a testimo
ny of the transformative powers ol Islam,
and a genuine concern for the future of our
children:
No more hangin with those guys,
I'm rollin with righteous Brothers in suits and
bow ties
Who worship the Most High
With a purpose for living
Striving to follow the Qur'an, married to right-

It feels to good
to know that
you're part of
the struggle and
that you re doing
something.
L

eous women
Supreme' Wisdom, been handed down by a Sav
ior
Fulfilling what's written
Witness Divine intervention
Behold God makes all things new
Through Minister Farrakhan...
Not only is Brother JT 'spittin' .spiritual
lyrics, but he is applying the teachings of
Islam to his music business: "Just because
of how 1 conduct myself, 1 know I'm not
just a regular rap artist. 1 got something
positive to say, you feel me? The hardcore
brothas respect me. A lot of people respect
me for my business ethic, how I conduct
myself in the business. I put it out there
real heavy about being independent. All

these different principles I'm learning at
the mosque. So, maybe how I was natural
ly really got brought up out of me fully by
coming to the mosque. Islam brings that
up out of you. So, over time I started seeing
that, you know, Allah put me in this unique
position to address the parents, to address
the children."
111 addressing the potential power of hip
hop, Brother JT states: "What's being set
up through Master Fard Muhammad and
the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, and
now Minister Louis Farrakhan, is some
thing that's going to continue. So now, tHe

culture that we have right now is
going to be even more refined
through the teachings of the Hon
orable Elijah Muhammad. Now,
once the rappers get that message
and start hearing it now, that will
turn the people around!"
Brother JT sees himself as a mem
ber of a community that is strug
gling and striving towards perfec
tion, for he says he believes that
struggle is ordained. "I'm bearing
witness to the truth as best as I un
derstand it. And I'm letting you
know that just because you see me
here involved in this work, that it's
still struggle, you feel me? But it
feels good to know that you're part
of the struggle, and that you're
doing something, and that you're
on the right path."
Brother JT has continued the
African oral tradition of nation
conscious rap and and nation
building through words into the
new century — independent,
black-owned, positive — words
backed by JT's actions. With all of
the success he is having (and, as he

says, "All praise is clue to Allah") Brother
JT puts the rap game into perspective:
"The real pleasure, the number one
pleasure, comes from pleasing Allah, or
God as you know him. But we're all
caught up in going the other way. So, you
know, now th.it my album is out, I tried
to design my album as best I could to
whereas Minister Farrakhan would be
happy with it."
Brother Minister Christopher Muham
mad of Mosque #2b has supported Broth
er JT throughout his continuing evolution
and growth as an artist and believer. And
given Minister Farrakhan's progressive
stance on rap music, he may be listening to
Brother JT's album — and smiling all the
way through.

Prophecy." Brother JT raps:
The Book of Revelations is a mantle in time
And the Holy Qur'an is a book that binds
Every man to his actions, self-accusing spirit
The Messenger delivered the message so we can
hear it
And make a choice to get it right or keep it
wrong
While we battle temptation that's why I'm
singing this song
So beat the prophecy!

Addressing Willie Lynch's prophecy of
the lilack Man's death and destruction,
Brother San Quinn relays a message for
the time. In his words, one hears a testimo
ny of the transformative powers ol Islam,
and a genuine concern for the future of our
children:
No more hangin with those guys,
I'm rollin with righteous Brothers in suits and
bow ties
Who worship the Most High
With a purpose for living
Striving to follow the Qur'an, married to right-

It feels to good
to know that
you're part of
the struggle and
that you re doing
something.
L

eous women
Supreme' Wisdom, been handed down by a Sav

Through Minister Farrakhan...
Not only is Brother JT 'spittin' .spiritual
lyrics, but he is applying the teachings of
Islam to his music business: "Just because
of how 1 conduct myself, 1 know I'm not
just a regular rap artist. 1 got something
positive to say, you feel me? The hardcore
brothas respect me. A lot of people respect
me for my business ethic, how I conduct
myself in the business. I put it out there
real heavy about being independent. All

these different principles I'm learning at
the mosque. So, maybe how I was natural
ly really got brought up out of me fully by
coming to the mosque. Islam brings that
up out of you. So, over time I started seeing
that, you know, Allah put me in this unique
position to address the parents, to address
the children."
111 addressing the potential power of hip
hop, Brother JT states: "What's being set
up through Master Fard Muhammad and
the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, and
now Minister Louis Farrakhan, is some
thing that's going to continue. So now, tHe

culture that we have right now is
going to be even more refined
through the teachings of the Hon
orable Elijah Muhammad. Now,
once the rappers get that message
and start hearing it now, that will
turn the people around!"
Brother JT sees himself as a mem
ber of a community that is strug
gling and striving towards perfec
tion, for he says he believes that
struggle is ordained. "I'm bearing
witness to the truth as best as I un
derstand it. And I'm letting you
know that just because you see me
here involved in this work, that it's
still struggle, you feel me? But it
feels good to know that you're part
of the struggle, and that you're
doing something, and that you're
on the right path."
Brother JT has continued the
African oral tradition of nation
conscious rap and and nation
building through words into the
new century — independent,
black-owned, positive — words
backed by JT's actions. With all of
the success he is having (and, as he

says, "All praise is clue to Allah") Brother
JT puts the rap game into perspective:
"The real pleasure, the number one
pleasure, comes from pleasing Allah, or
God as you know him. But we're all
caught up in going the other way. So, you
know, now th.it my album is out, I tried
to design my album as best I could to
whereas Minister Farrakhan would be
happy with it."
Brother Minister Christopher Muham
mad of Mosque #2b has supported Broth
er JT throughout his continuing evolution
and growth as an artist and believer. And
given Minister Farrakhan's progressive
stance on rap music, he may be listening to
Brother JT's album — and smiling all the
way through.
One of the Bay Area's most popular rap
artists, JT the Bigga Figga, a.k.a. Brother
Joseph Muhammad, has released his latest
solo album, "Something Crucial," on his
own Cet Low Record/ in conjunction with
1)1 A Records. The album features collabo
rations with many Bay Area stars such as
San Quinn, Mac Mall, Yukmouth (lrom the
Luniz), Steady Mobbin', Killa Tay, The
(Gambia/, and more.
Fans bought over 1 ()(),()()() units on the
first day of release, and they consider this
album to be Brother JT's best product yet.
The Bigga Figga's crucial release features
songs like "Another Fpisode," "Fedi Can't
Buy You Love" and "Beware of Those"
that are bound to be hits.
However, "The Hidden Hand," and
"Beating Prophecy," are the highlights of the
alburn. Both songs have been heavily influ
enced by the teachings of the Honorable Fli
jah Muhammad as taught by the Honorable
Minister Louis Farrakhan. In"The Hidden
I land,'' the sixth track on the new album, |T
reveals the truth behind Willie Lynch's
wicked plan. Willie Lynch was a white slave
owner who wrote a document titled "Let's
Make a Slave: The origin and development of
a social being called the 'negro.' " His docu
ment discussed, in a very graphic manner,
how to enslave the minds of Africans and how
to devise and implement several strategies to
keep the enslaved Africans divided so that
they would not rise against the slavemasters.
Brother JT reflects on the song and
breaks down the science behind it:"I tried
to place that song in track number six be
cause six represents the beast. And it rep
resents incompletion, because with the
number six, the head is at the bottom.
When you're complete, the head is at the
top. 'The Hidden Hand' is hidden, you
know what I'm saying? Like Minister Far
rakhan was teaching us about 'The I iidden
Hand' and their plot to do what they have
clone and are doing. So, 'The Hidden
Hand' is something that's an on-going
thing, you just don't see it. So, it gives you
the illusion that nothing is happening. So,
my verse grew out of that meeting where
we talked about Willie Lynch. And Willie
Lynch played a major role in the Hidden
Hand from way back then. How he would
have the slaves fighting and arguing over
their differences and they didn't know
why. But he initiated it."
When asked about his motivation for

writing such a powerful piece, Brother |T
adds: "I wanted to write that song. I knew
that this is what the Minister wanted at the
meeting. I was inspired to write that verse.
It's all from the heart, you know what I'm
saying? This music, man, is a way to wake
these people up."
The meeting Brother JT is referring to
is the historic Rapper's Summit where
Minister Farrakhan met with leaders of the
hip-hop community, such as Snoop Hogg,
Kam, Ice Cube, Common, Coodie Mob,
Chuck I), Too Short, Russell Simmons,
Bone Thugs N Harmony, Fat Joe, Kurupt,
Doug F Fresh, Davey I) and many others.
The summit had a tremendous impact on
Brother JT.
"I'm not supposed to be in this rap game
just trying to please myself. I'm thinking
about the impact it's having on my com
munity, the impact it's having on the Na
tion [of Islam], the impact that it just has on
me, you know. I really started realizing it
when I first started corning to [Mosque #26
on 3rd Street in San Francisco] in '92. Now,
it's 2000 and I can see it even more clearer
that I got a bigger work to do through this
music.
"And Minister Farrakhan confirmed it
even more, too, when we was at his home
on April 3rd, 1997 — about who the rap
pers are. I le said the rappers are the lead
ers. He said we're like the 'pied pipers.' He
didn't want to use that word, but the peo
ple respond to our tune. They're listening
to what we're saying. I Ie was really just let
ting us know that we're put in this position
for (iod's purpose, though, you know what
I'm saying? The Minister said that the rap
pers are the number-one teachers. The
rappers have more influence over the peo
ple, really, than the teachers, preachers,
politicians, the presidents, the mayors; He
said with the exception of himself [laugh
ing]. Let me make that real clear!"
With this spirit in mind, Brother JT,
Brother San Quinn and Brotha John collabo
