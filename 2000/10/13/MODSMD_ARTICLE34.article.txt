# Mack 10 gets married but stays misogynistic

Mack 10's new album, "The Paper Route," is I lit- product
of his recent commitment to "do hard-core records that sound
universal." lie succeeds, but at the expense ol the lyrical and
thematic advent urousness of his previous albums.
Like previous ellorts, "The Paper Route" features a small
army of guest stars, who generally add to the quality of the
overall product. The injection of such ghetto superstars as

Too $hort, Westside (Connection,
T-80/, X/.ibit, Youngblood/ and
Big (>ipp, however, does not make
up lor the mediocre production
and the constant rehashing ol
gangsta rap cliches.
The album gets oil to a brisk and
truly gangsta start with the liist sin
gle, "From the Street/.." t he song

doesn't go much deeper than the title would suggest. It paral
lels L.L. (1(K)1 |.'s "Mamma Said knot k You ()ut" as a recla
mation of the artist's hardcore roots.
The second song on the- album, "Nobody, is a good,
though not primo, Pimbaland produced track. It features
Tim's trademark complex drum patterns, but lacks the surre
al intensity of his other leats (see |a\ /. s "Nigga What").
Perhaps the most interesting track on the album is the dou
ble-entendre-laced "I'm Dope." in which Mack speaks from

the perspective of various street drugs: "I took planes and
trains and busses outta town / If you cook me too long, 1 might
turn brown."
Unfortunately, the concept of rapping from the point of
view of inanimate objects isn't new (one is quickly reminded ol
Nas's "I Gave You Power" and Celly Cell's Tha Bullet'). The
beat sounds like a more invigorating incarnation of a Swi/.z
beats track: synth horns and simplistic start-and-stop drum
and bass patterns.
Mack's decision to "do hard-core records that sound
universal" was largely influenced by his wife, T-Boz of

Tlx: (ilit* two got married Aug. 19, 2000). She
shows her support on the second single, "Tight
to Del," <1 stimulating and danceable crossover
attempt that rips off the beat from Volume 10's
"Pistolgrip I'ump."
Strangely, and perhaps sadly, "Tight to
1 )cf," an upbeat husband and wile collaboration,
is sandwiched between two grossly misogynistic
tracks. "Pimp or Die" features pimp turned hip

hop auteur Too Short and his normal slew of woman-hat
ing lyrics.
"Pop X" was seemingly inspired by the hedonistic im
pulses fueled b\ the drug ecstasy, and features such lyrical
gems as "Squeeze it don't tease it, 1 got something for you
to taste / So jack me oil and lick it 'til I nut in your face,
bitch." I'he song features t rip-walker Xzibit, but even his
usuallv inspired lyricism falls short and fails to add any re
deeming value.

The second half of the album is more devoid of highlights
than the first. "Spousal abuse" is a purging bit of introspection
on Mack's part, reflecting on his past troubles with domestic vi
olence and child support suits. "Tha Weekend" is a bass-heavy
booty-shake track, featuring Ice Cube and formed using the
same mold as Cube's "We lie Clubbin."
Despite its artistic failings, "The Paper Route" suffices as a
party record and a trunk rattler. It also embodies the ambiva
lence of gangsta rappers caught between their larger-than-life
personas and their real-life duties as husbands and fathers.
While claiming to be a family man who loves his wile and kids,
Mack still finds time to "pop X" and "pimp hos."
Anyone looking fora more consistent gangsta rap record
with superior production and sharper lyrics is advised to seek
out Mack's older material (his third album, " The Recipe," is
stellar) or that of his mentor Ice Cube.
