Dieselboy
The Sixth Session
Moonshine Music v -——

Phe same skills that allowed him
to win "Top Drum & Bass l)| (llob
al Mix honors in 199« Sand —and
showed the field of U.K.-centric
d'n'b-heads that there is something
else out there — are still in ettect.
With this clout, he is somewhat ol an
ambassador lor the genre, develop
ing quite a following and always at
tracting new folks into the Ibid ol
drum & bass music.
Despite his relentless touring, he
has been able to hook up with U.K.'s
Technical Itch to produce tunes in
ternationally, as well as domestical
ly, on the label Palm Pictures. I lis
five previous mix compact discs

ovei the p.ist lour \ears have been a
panorama of drum and bass si\les,
starting with hip-hop inllucnccd
jump-up and moving across
through harder, more aseptic beats
.md into the diverse techno / rave
oriented beats ol toda\ in his best
mix to date, "System I pgtade."
" The Sixth Session," however,
destro\s all the- rest. I his is hands
down the freshest drum and bass

compilation ever to come out,
as only two of the tracks on it
will have been released In the
time this album conies out.
Dieselboy is the only 1)| who
has the ability to bust out dub
plates (the vim I analogue to
burning a (11) R) and test
pressings in an attempt to
capture tlu- mood ol rapidlv
progressing drum and bass.
Unlike the standard
mixed compact disc , which,

unlbrtunatclv, is now done purely
on computer away Irom the turnta
bles (see Paul ()akenlbld), Dieselboy
has never feared the turntables. I le
lias always shown his subtly expres
sive style in his mixes while keeping
the beats tight. Adding a sample
here, an underlying drum track
there, a filter sweep from time to
time, his performance on this mix is
110 exception.
I lis atmospheric intro (co-pro
duced by Dieselboy and SF natives

Atlantiq) morphs seamless!) into the
anthem ol today, Konllict's "Messi
ah." From the tribal vocal drone
and lloor-lilling tearout bass into
the bouncing evil twisted house
chords, this track is one lor all those
who love elet troni< music. I he pur
suit is on; the syncopated drums
come out and drive ihc pace ol the
music, Ibrcing everyone to leel the
beats.

[This is hands down the
freshest drum and bass
compilation to
ever come out.

From here. Dieselboy chugs into
technical Itch's "Heavy Metal,"
complete with its schizophrenic
grow-line hassline and eerie leads
over his characteristic aniens. I lis
"aniens" are the seminal drum sam
ple of drum and bass from the '60s
song "Amen Brother" by The Win
stons and first sampled widely by
Eric 11. and Kakim before being
adopted by the rave scene.
Dieselboy then twists into a rare
track that will blow up in the near

future, "Nanobugs," by Signal to
Noise. Complete with a wobbling
bassline and llatlining bleeps, this
song keeps the energy pumping. It
also srts the pate through a couple
more rolling tracks with big
basslines, leading into a track by the
dons ol current drum and bass. Bad
(lonipanv. "Toxin" brings in jazzy
( hords and venal snippets which
turn into a rave-inspired lead with

skanky drums. 'Tlit*
listener's head lias to
keep bouncing.
Next, Dieselboy
displays a l>i( of his
own skill with two Vll'
mixes of his tunes by
SF- .md LA-based
Phunkateck erew
members. First, K
sassin's VlPoPfnvid"
grinds out the bass,
making it a bit more

complex than the original, as well as
adding a bit more energy to the
drums. The darkness is conserved,
and so are the gothic screeches.
Dieselboy then mixes the Phunkate
ck VIP of "The Descent." From the
minute the original whiny synth
hits, this song lias that hands-in-the
air feel.
From here on out, Dieselboy
continues the dark vibe, bringing
out songs like Loxy + Dylan's
"Eclipse" with a hardcore techno-

inspired -4/4 breakdown. A hip
hop snippet in "Plimsoul VIP" by
Kacs + B key provide some novelty
before the welcome syncopated
drums of Teebee's "Space Age"
remix. In keeping with the retro
flair that is the fad these days,
Dieselboy then packs in Dylan's
rave track, "Dominion," with its
simple aniens, backwards fills and
hardcore vocal stabs.
Dieselboy saves the best for last,
however, with |. Majik's "Solarize."
Out of a simple airy female vocal
sample, J. Majik brings in the tech
no vibe over atmospherics to create
a track worthy to smash up any
dancelloor. The breakdown throws
the listener fora loop, as it starts out
.it tec lino-style bpm's before slowly
speeding up, up, up, and back into
the breakneck pace of drum and
bass. This is a perfect finale for
Dieselboy's mix.
None of these songs by them
selves will get boring. Dieselboy's
mix brings them all together per
fectly. 1 lis mixing is technically flaw
less, highly diverse and always
smooth. And, as if that was not
enough, there is a bonus unmixed
album with Dieselboy's three singles
on Palm Pictures, as well as the two
Phunkateck VIP remixes. With this
much music on two discs, "Sixth

Dieselboy
The Sixth Session
Moonshine Music v -——

Phe same skills that allowed him
to win "Top Drum & Bass l)| (llob
al Mix honors in 199« Sand —and
showed the field of U.K.-centric
d'n'b-heads that there is something
else out there — are still in ettect.
With this clout, he is somewhat ol an
ambassador lor the genre, develop
ing quite a following and always at
tracting new folks into the Ibid ol
drum & bass music.
Despite his relentless touring, he
has been able to hook up with U.K.'s
Technical Itch to produce tunes in
ternationally, as well as domestical
ly, on the label Palm Pictures. I lis
five previous mix compact discs

ovei the p.ist lour \ears have been a
panorama of drum and bass si\les,
starting with hip-hop inllucnccd
jump-up and moving across
through harder, more aseptic beats
.md into the diverse techno / rave
oriented beats ol toda\ in his best
mix to date, "System I pgtade."
" The Sixth Session," however,
destro\s all the- rest. I his is hands
down the freshest drum and bass

compilation ever to come out,
as only two of the tracks on it
will have been released In the
time this album conies out.
Dieselboy is the only 1)| who
has the ability to bust out dub
plates (the vim I analogue to
burning a (11) R) and test
pressings in an attempt to
capture tlu- mood ol rapidlv
progressing drum and bass.
Unlike the standard
mixed compact disc , which,

unlbrtunatclv, is now done purely
on computer away Irom the turnta
bles (see Paul ()akenlbld), Dieselboy
has never feared the turntables. I le
lias always shown his subtly expres
sive style in his mixes while keeping
the beats tight. Adding a sample
here, an underlying drum track
there, a filter sweep from time to
time, his performance on this mix is
110 exception.
I lis atmospheric intro (co-pro
duced by Dieselboy and SF natives

Atlantiq) morphs seamless!) into the
anthem ol today, Konllict's "Messi
ah." From the tribal vocal drone
and lloor-lilling tearout bass into
the bouncing evil twisted house
chords, this track is one lor all those
who love elet troni< music. I he pur
suit is on; the syncopated drums
come out and drive ihc pace ol the
music, Ibrcing everyone to leel the
beats.

[This is hands down the
freshest drum and bass
compilation to
ever come out.

From here. Dieselboy chugs into
technical Itch's "Heavy Metal,"
complete with its schizophrenic
grow-line hassline and eerie leads
over his characteristic aniens. I lis
"aniens" are the seminal drum sam
ple of drum and bass from the '60s
song "Amen Brother" by The Win
stons and first sampled widely by
Eric 11. and Kakim before being
adopted by the rave scene.
Dieselboy then twists into a rare
track that will blow up in the near

future, "Nanobugs," by Signal to
Noise. Complete with a wobbling
bassline and llatlining bleeps, this
song keeps the energy pumping. It
also srts the pate through a couple
more rolling tracks with big
basslines, leading into a track by the
dons ol current drum and bass. Bad
(lonipanv. "Toxin" brings in jazzy
( hords and venal snippets which
turn into a rave-inspired lead with

skanky drums. 'Tlit*
listener's head lias to
keep bouncing.
Next, Dieselboy
displays a l>i( of his
own skill with two Vll'
mixes of his tunes by
SF- .md LA-based
Phunkateck erew
members. First, K
sassin's VlPoPfnvid"
grinds out the bass,
making it a bit more

complex than the original, as well as
adding a bit more energy to the
drums. The darkness is conserved,
and so are the gothic screeches.
Dieselboy then mixes the Phunkate
ck VIP of "The Descent." From the
minute the original whiny synth
hits, this song lias that hands-in-the
air feel.
From here on out, Dieselboy
continues the dark vibe, bringing
out songs like Loxy + Dylan's
"Eclipse" with a hardcore techno-

inspired -4/4 breakdown. A hip
hop snippet in "Plimsoul VIP" by
Kacs + B key provide some novelty
before the welcome syncopated
drums of Teebee's "Space Age"
remix. In keeping with the retro
flair that is the fad these days,
Dieselboy then packs in Dylan's
rave track, "Dominion," with its
simple aniens, backwards fills and
hardcore vocal stabs.
Dieselboy saves the best for last,
however, with |. Majik's "Solarize."
Out of a simple airy female vocal
sample, J. Majik brings in the tech
no vibe over atmospherics to create
a track worthy to smash up any
dancelloor. The breakdown throws
the listener fora loop, as it starts out
.it tec lino-style bpm's before slowly
speeding up, up, up, and back into
the breakneck pace of drum and
bass. This is a perfect finale for
Dieselboy's mix.
None of these songs by them
selves will get boring. Dieselboy's
mix brings them all together per
fectly. 1 lis mixing is technically flaw
less, highly diverse and always
smooth. And, as if that was not
enough, there is a bonus unmixed
album with Dieselboy's three singles
on Palm Pictures, as well as the two
Phunkateck VIP remixes. With this
much music on two discs, "Sixth
Session" is definitely not to be
missed.
