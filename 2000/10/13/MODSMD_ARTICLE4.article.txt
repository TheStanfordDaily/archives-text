## 
### MARK DOMINIK 
Registrar Roger I'rintup discussed the installation of
Axess 2000 — a new system thai will replace the cur
rent version of Axess — which the University began
phasing in last March, at yesterday's Faculty Senate
meeting. The project is scheduled to be complete by
2004.
'I he current system has many deficiencies," I'rintup
said. When completed, the new system will be better
able to handle the 100,000 inquiries, 27.000 applica
tions, 10,000 requests lor transcripts and $200 million of
tuition ii processes every year, he said.
Additionally, the new system will allow faculty to
gain access to Axess.
"Fac ult\ will have ac c ess to class lists.... [They] will
have access to grades [they've] given students . . . [and
thev] will have access to the transcript data of advisees,"
I'rintup said.
The closing oft he Dish and the Introduction to 1 lu
manities program were also discussed at the meeting.
()f concern to the faculty were the new restrictions
placed on Dish acc ess. English Prof. Robert Polhemus
asked University President John Hennessy why access
to the Dish has been restricted.
"For many years, the I >ish was not open, and was re
stricted. In the late 1980s, we opened the Dish with
three restrictions: people were to stay on the paved
trails, all dogs were to be kept on leashes and the Dish
was closed at sunset. All three of these failed," 1 letmessy
responded.
"In a survey conducted in the summer, more clogs
were off-leash than on-leash . . . [additionally], the Cal
ifornia tiger salamander, which we are a host of, is a
candidate for being listed as an endangered
spec ies . .. we must come up with a plan that would
conserve and restore the environment of the Dish
area," 1 letmessy added.
I he expected cost of the Dish project — which in
cludes capital improvements, environmental preserva
tion and security patrols — is between $4 and $5 mil
lion.
Upon the recommendation the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies, the Senate voted that courses in
the Area 1 (Introduction to Humanities) requirement
will not be allowed to satisfy other Cenetal Education
Requirements.
"To allow double counting would create inequities
of opportunity," Ccllxt said.
