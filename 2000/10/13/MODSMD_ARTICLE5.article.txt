# Freshmen, seniors:
## Prepare to Pucker Up 
### MICHAEL SCRAFFORD 
The freshman experience:
New classes. New faces. All
nighters. Making out with lots of
people? That's definitely an op
tion tonight. Around the stroke
of midnight, freshmen and se
niors will give their lips a work
out under the October moon
light in Main Quad. Full Moon
on the Quad has arrived.
According to myth, freshmen
are not official Stanford students
until they've been kissed by a se
nior. This time-honored tradi
tion involves all interested fresh
men venturingout into the night
air to be formally welcomed by
seniors, as well as sophomores
and juniors who want to meet a
very friendly crowd.
One may think that this is a
slightly "sketchy" event, but even
Vice Provost for Student Allans
)im Montoya finds value in the
gathering.
"I personally like those Stan
lord traditions that emphasize
class unity and ch ss interaction
in the moonlight," Montoya
said. "Given that many claim
that dating does not exist at Stan
lord, lull Moon on the Quad oi
lers students a unique opportu
nity to get to know one another.
Can you imagine such an event
at Harvard?"
With the help of the experi
enced seniors, the event should
go smoothly for anxious fresh
men. However, students agree
that there are a few pieces of ad
vice that must be taken into ac -
count before venturing out.
"Freshmen should definitely
have ai least a cocktail or two be
fore going, or it could be pretty
scary," senior ('.olleen Shaw said.
"Trust me, the advice comes
from personal experience."

Senior Ryan Hlit stein af
firmed this lesson.
"ft was pretty whack and
weird because 1 didn't get drunk
enough," he said.
Feelings about the event vary
from scared to excited, but stu
dents seem to have some sort of
preconceived notion about how
things will go when over 3,000
hormone-driven college stu
dents come together tonight.
Freshman Freddy Valdessaid he
feels that full Moon will be more
of a way to meet new people and
just have good, c lean fun rather
than meet a life-long mate.
"I don't think freshmen are
going to 'get some' but rather
will encounter new people in a
freshman bonding experience,"
Valdes said. "More accurately,
|it sJ a freshman-senior bonding
experience."
but not all students feel that
this will strictly be a freshman
sophomore event.
"Not all people are who they
say they are.' said sophomore
|ian Shell, referring to the many
sophomores and juniors who try
every year to participate in the
festivities by inisidentifying
themselves as freshmen and
sophomores.
A portion of the spotlight
tonight will be focused 011 the
Stanlord mascot, the Iree. Over
the years, the Tree has devel
oped quite <1 reputation. Kverv
year, the line of students eager to
attain the I tee's coveted kiss has
grown. The past five Frees have
raised the kiss count since 1995.
Senior Alex Newell, this year's
mascot, has quite a task ahead of
her if she wants to surpass the
record set by last year's tree,
