Anything Is Possible
This is where the generation of new ideas lives.
Because we've built a global network of people who
see possibilities where others see confusion and risk
— and who know how to turn those possibilities into
realities. And by working at internet speed — propelling
dozens of companies and millions of investors into the
new economy.
We are propelling careers all over the world.
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter invites you to our
