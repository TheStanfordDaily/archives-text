Betty Strickland, SFCU I luman
Resource Manager and Olympic caliber jnTl^
karate expert was willing to set aside her , t
dreams of the gold medal for golden
member care.
"I would have enjoyed joining my |
teammates in Sydney, but the team at m Vf
SFCU is more important to me. My dreams ||
will have to wait—our members' dreams '4
come first. At SFCU we want our mem- ■ 112
bers to have their dream cars, own their M
dream homes, and enjoy the retirement
of their dreams—and we'll do what it
takes to help them. My greatest
strength (besides bench pressing 320)
is being an effective liaison between
the Credit Union and the Stanford
community," says Betty.
It's this kind of dedication from —*
staff and members that makes
Stanford Federal Credit Union such a valuable resource for the Stanford
Community.Thanks, Betty. We think you're a gold medalist already.
