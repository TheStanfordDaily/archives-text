1958
On October 10, 1958, The Daily ran an
article headlined " Beatnik' Revolt Called
Search for Identity.'
"Despite the sensationalism of the 'so
called Beatnik movement,' there is a defi
nite general trend in the country toward
the new Bohemia, said Pierre Delattre in
his uilk to the United Fellowship Tuesday.
"From his viewpoint as minister to San
Francisco's publicized North Beach, Delat
tre sees the movement at present as nega
tive rather than affirmative. The 'Beats'
are in rebellion.
"The major rebellion is against becom
ing the "Invisible man" of today's subur
bia. There is a search for identity as a cre
ative individual, apart from the group.
"The 'Beat' movement is an artistic
movement, but paradoxically no artist in
North Beach really works at his art. The
poetry is a thing to be read one night and
then thrown away. There is no attempt to
make the art permanent.
"Delattre thinks this is indicative of a
lack of belief. 1 le leels that basically the
"beats" do not have faith in their rebel
lion."
Bottom line: "A thing to be read one night and
then thrown away"? That makes Beatnik poetry
sound like an l-Hum essay.
