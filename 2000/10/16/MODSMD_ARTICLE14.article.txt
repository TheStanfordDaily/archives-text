## Saudi plane hijacked 
### 
BA(iHl)Al), Iraq (AP) — 1 he\
had been in the air <ml\ two hours
when first (lass passengers noticed
a llight attendant emerge from the
cockpit with teat sin her eves. Pas
sengers became more concerned
when the "fasten seat belts" want
ing light failed to go oil and the
monitor tracking their llight went
blank. London-bound Saudi Ara
bian Airlines Might 1 15 had been
hijacked.
But passengers weren't told this
while the\ were in the air. and the
crew remained mi calm that some
passengers learned of it otilv after
the plane landed in Baghdad late
Saturday after a 7 1/2-hour
odyssev that began in |iddah,
Saudi Arabia.
"1 first thought we landed at
Heathrow in London. But when I
looked through the window I said
to mvself, 'This is not London,' "
said Iqbal Dawood from Pakistan,
one ol the KKi passengers and
i rew on the flight.
I lalf an hour after landing, the
captain announced to passengers
ili.it the plane had been hijacked
and that negotiations were under
way.
I he two hijacking suspects sur
rendered without incident in
Baghdad.

Passengers and crew from
Flight 115 spent the night in
Baghdad, then boarded their
plane — some running in joy
across the tarmac to the Boeing
777 — to leave yesterday evening.
A few hours later, the plane land
ed at Rivadh airport in Saudi Ara
bia. Some passengers were to con
tinue on to London on another
flight.
fhe suspects, identified by
Saudi Arabian officials as Faisal al-
Biloowi and Ayish al-Faridi. told
reporters they hijacked the plane
to demand rights lor the Saudi
people.
"We want to choose our own
leaders, fhe time of kings and
monarchies is over." al-Faridi said.
I he men also complained
about human rights abuses, cor
ruption and unemployment.
"Saudi people cannot lind work
and the\ bring foreigners in to
protect us. We can protect our
selves," said al-Faridi, half his face
hidden behind a scarf.
Saudi officials said on condition
of anonvniin that al-Biloowi was
an undercover security officer at
the Jiddah airport and al-Faridi
was a bolder guard.
I he hijacking took place at a
time when anti-l'.S. sentiment is

running high in a region wracked
by bloody Israeli-Palestinian clash
es. Main Arabs believe the United
States lavors Israel, but the Saudi
government is a close I .S. ally and
has allowed U.S. troop bases on its
territory since the Gulf YVar.
11 wasn't immediately clear
whether the hijackers were armed
or how they seized control of the
aircraft. One ol the hijackers at
one point threatened to blow up
ilk- plane unless it was allowed to
llv to Baghdad, Saudi officials said.
faher Haboush, the Iraqi offi
cial who led negotiations with the
hijackers, said the men asked lor
political asvlum. Km they denied
requesting asylum and said they
would eventually like to leave Iraq.
Saudi Arabia will demand their
immediate extradition, Saudi Ara
bia's l)eput\ Interior Minister
Prince Ahmed said yesterday.
1 lijacking carries the death penal
ty in Saudi Arabia.
It is unclear whether Iraq will
heed the Saudi demand. The
countries have had no relations
since Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait
in 1990, but a pre-GullAVar treat\
provides for extradition.
I lie passengers included 40
Britons, 1") Saudis, 15 Pakistanis,
four Yemenis, four South Africans,

two k</nvans. and one ea< h from
France, India, Lebanon, Nigeria,
Oman, tlie Palestinian territories,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and
the I nited States, airline officials
said.
Among them was Saudi Prince

Bandat bin Mohammed bin Saad
bin Abdul-Rahman, a 19-year-old
cousin ol King Fahd who was on his
way to London to stud) Fnglish.
Ii was the second hijacking in
the (•ult in a month.
On Sept. 14, an Iraqi man

armed with a knife hijacked a
Qatar Airways plane en route to
|ordan and ordered it tlown to
Saudi Arabia.
All 144 passengers and crew
escaped unharmed when the man
surrendered in the Saudi c it\ of 1 lael.
