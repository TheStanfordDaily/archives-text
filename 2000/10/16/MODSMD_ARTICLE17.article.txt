SAN JOSK, (-alii. (AP) — Aim an
entire \ear ol lobbying Congress to raise
the visa limit for foreign workers, te< h
nolog\ companies were not about to sit
still when political jockeying threatened
lo derail the hill.
So they enlisted supporters to heat
down lawmakers doors, while lech lobby
ists met with congressional stallers daily.
The industry also ollered "sweeteners" to
in.ike the legislation more palatable,
including increased \isa lees to pav lor
educating .American workers.
Last week, the bill passed both houses

ol Congress in short order — testament to
the increasing ability of high tech to move
and shake W ashington policy-makers.
Cisco Systems, Inc., KxciteAtHome
and ;K'.om Corp. are just a lew of the
growing number of Information Age
companies that have set up ollices in
Washington, I>.C. in the past two years as
the industry spends more time and
money than ever on politics.

tributed at least $22.1 million to this
year's campaigns for federal ollices —
more than double the $0.."> million con

tributed in the previous two-year election
cycle, and the $K. 9 million in the cycle
before that, according to the nonpartisan
Center lot Responsive Politics.
The figures, last compiled In the
watchdog organization in August, includ
ed contributions from political action
committees, individuals, and soft-monc\
donors.
Democrats netted just over hall Of the
contributions in the current cycle, though
in the presidential race, Cov. CJeorge W.
Hush collected nearly $1 million, more
than double Vice President Al Core's

take.
Other top recipients were senators in
ke\ positions to push high-tech legisla
tion. Nearly $300,000 went to Sen. John
McCain, chair ol the Commerce, Science
and Transportation Committee, and
almost $200,000 went to Sen. Spencer
Abraham, also menibei ol the commerce
committee and chair ol <i judiciary sub

Anxious to tap into the China market,
the industry also lobbied hard lor nor
malizing trade with China — and has
pushed lor loosened export controls on

computers and encryption products.
Cisco chairman |ohn Chambers — a
top donor to hotli the Core and Bush
presidential campaigns — was among the
iirst Silicon Valle\ moguls to venture into
politics.
"Five years ago, most of us ignored
politic s .ind kept ii at arms' length — that
was terribly naive. Chambers said in an
