## The 						Stanford Daily Campbell's tenure was sustained too long 
### 
Published Since IS9I

LAW PROF. TOM Campbell will
probablv be heading back to the
Farm in January. Since 1989,
Campbell lias spent nine years as a
member of Congress and two years as a (lal
ifornia State Senator. With three weeks left
in his race fora I .S. Senate seat, lie trails in
the polls by about 20 percent. If he were to
win the race and choose to serve on the Sen
ate, his tenure would be terminated. If he
loses the race, he will return to Stanford.
Law School Dean Kathleen Sullivan said
that Campbell's leaves have been "extraor
dinary' in length. We believe that his leaves
have not onlv been extraordinary, but have
been inconsistent with the goals of this
university.
Should Campbell lose, the Stanford com
munity will benefit from his return. The
Law School will regain an expert on

antitrust law, whose experience in Congress
should benefit his students. His distin
guished record should also add to the L!ni
versity by increasing its prestige. It will, no
doubt, be wonderful to have a former mem
ber of Congess on staff.
Because of what Stanford has to gain
from Campbell's presence, former Law
School Dean Paul Brest was right in setting
a deadline for his return. Likewise Sullivan
is right in keeping to the deadline, which
stands at January 2001.
However, it was wrong for the Law
School and the University to let Campbell
keep his tenure when he first left for
Congress in 1989. I lie tenure system allows
professors a considerable amount of free
dom to pursue their academic interests. For
Campbell, this may have meant a role as an
adviser to the Justice Department in their

case against Microsoft. It may have meant
an extended sta) in South Korea to study
their antitrust laws. It could have even
meant holding a job in Washington fora few
years, as long as it contributed to his aca
demic work.
But as a member of Congress, Campbell
has pursued his political interests, not his
academic interests. He may have handled
some antitrust work and undoubtedly han
dled general legal issues, but his service in
Congress can hardly be viewed as an aca
demic expedition.
It appears that the administration acted
as an investor does when they purchase
stock. It permitted Campbell to go to Wash
ington so that he could come back as a big
ger asset. But how do the University's
administrators decide on what investments
to make? Would they invest in a medical

school professor that wants to work in sub-
Saharan Africa? Would they invest in a Busi
ness School prof, who wants to build a start
up into a Fortune 500 powerhouse? What if
one of Campbell's colleagues wanted to be a
partner in a corporate law firm fora decade
or so?
The investment model may not be the
best one to use in tenure decisions. Is this
the way we want to think about the people
that we hire as professors to educate and
counsel students?
Campbell's leave was an investment that
we hope will pay off for the University. But
the University should not make such invest
ments; it should invest in academic pursuits.
These investments do not yield former Con
gressmen, they yield excellent academic
work, and we are, after all, an academic
institution.
