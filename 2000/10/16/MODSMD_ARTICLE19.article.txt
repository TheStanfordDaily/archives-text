# TURNING AND TURNING
## You are not your major 
### 
What words iirst come to mind
when someone savs "com
puter science major"? Clan
vou spot a comparative liter
ature major from a hundred yards away?
What does a conversation between two
economics majors sound like? What sorts
of activities do pre-meds engage in?
If you can answer any of these ques
tions, vou are familiar with the mvth of
the major. In fact, most of your college
experience will he somehow affected In
the until. Il will choose your friends,
your clothes, your residences, your career
and your self-image, among other things.

The myth of the
tnajot. in four words, is
ihis: you are your major.
11 is, to be sure, a
simple concept. Per
haps it is even intuitive:
after all, doesn't our
decision to studv one
subject over another say
something about who
we are? Mavbe. But

does it sav everything about us?
This, generally, is where matters
become confused. Out <>l la/mess or sim
plistic thinking, we tend to confuse these
two questions. In a simple syntactical
step, people become "CS majors" and
"fuz/ies" rather than "people majoring in
computer science" and "people majoring
in the humanities."
At some point, you begin to induce —
with the help of those around you — the
typologies of different majors, including
your own. Black leather? Comparative lit
erature. Job-faii I-shirts? Computer sci
ence. Cellular phone? Economics.
Tweed? English. Tie-dve? Earth systems.
Pants on backwards? Engineering.
Never mind that the Platonic ideals
are generalizations that tend to weight
the standout cases rather than the norm.
Never mind that you just bought new
clothes to fit into your newly declared
major. Never mind that you have
become the standout case. Never mind
that you have just created your
own prison.
And then, to make it worse, a process
of academic balkanization takes place.
You decide that people in another major
don't understand how hard you work. ()r
that papers are harder than problem sets,
or vice versa. You decide that if someone
isn't thinking like you do, they aren't real
ly thinking. So you get the schisms — the
literature majors in one corner, com
plaining about the lemmings in the other

departments, while, in another corner,
engineering majors complain that
nobody else does any real work, and so
on. We stop talking to each other, and let
our majors speak for us.
What is ii that leads us to forget that
majoring in"the humanities" does not
necessarily make us more human (or
humane), that no department has an
exclusive claim to pettiness, that we all get
paid lor the work we do, that papers and
problem sets are just different names lor
homework?
We need to recover this understand
ing. Because humanities majors will use
Nietzsche's lest of eternal recurrence to
weed out potential friends in the same
way that others use fashion sense.
Because, today, economists like Amartya
Sen are doing more lor the well-being of
the world's people than humanists are.
Because Knglish majors go into consult
ing, too. Because computer science
majors have political views — and I don't
mean Republican ones. Because people
with industrial engineering degrees are
using their skills to organize activist
groups and protests. Because stock
options don't care what you studied in
college.
Still, we sink farther and farther into
our majors and allow them to become
bigger than they are. We try to make our
selves what we study, like the English
major who tries to prove his worth as an
Knglish major by not merely studying
James Joyce but by trying to become
|ames Joyce. Is that the goal of our
undergraduate education? To justify that
we will one day be worth studying?
()f all of the things we use to construct
our identities at Stanford, the undergrad
uate major seems to be ready-made to
suit that purpose. Which is precisely why
we should disregard it in our personal
interactions. There are better ways of get
ting to know each other than the ways
we've been trained to use.
If you don't learn new ways, you might
never meet the amazing medieval studies
major or economics major who is going to
change your life. And the clock is ti( king,
so think last —and reclaim yourself from
your major.
Vou are not your major. You are not
your dorm. You are not your I-Hum.
You are not what you did last summer.
Got that?
Now let's work from there.
