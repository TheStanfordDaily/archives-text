## 
### MARDEN F. NICHOLS 
During the first lew weeks of
school, most freshmen are bom
barded with magazines, fliers and
guide. The latest such publication
across their door, a cumulative ef
fort of a number of student
groups, ensures that new students
have opportunities to lorm a di
verse perspective of lilt- at Stan
ford.
The 2000-2001 Stanford Dis
orientation Ouide hit campus on
Oct. 1 1 and is still being distrib
uted in various locations. The red
booklet contains 79 pages of per
sonal narratives, cartoons, statis
tics, quotations, graphics and arti
cles covering controversial issues

such as poverty on campus, the
Asian American Studies Program
and the I loover Institution.
fhe goal of this yearly publica
tion, as stated in the introduction, is
to "initiate a new perspectiveon the
history of this institution, its cur
rent structure, and your role in it."
"I think that we have a lot of re
ally strong analytical articles," said
senior Louise Auerhahn, who
helped create the booklet. "Articles
that not only give the fads about
an issue, perspective or historical
event but that also explain how
and why things got to be the wa)
they are."
The guide's stall distributed
copies during Introduction
to the Humanities lectures and

copies are available at all the com
munity centers, including the
1 laas C -enter.
In an attempt to reach new stu
dents and influence the agendas of
on-campus organizations, the Dis
()rientation (iuicle's eclectic group
of editors chose to introduce their
publication during the first few
weeks oft he fall quarter. This is the
public ation's seventh year.
I o recruit the editorial and lay
out stall. Auerhahn and other core
participants in the publication sent
e-mail to various Stanford commu
nity members. I his call for action
included those in campus groups
such as the Student Labor-Action
Committee and Stanford Ameri
can Indian Organization, whose

mission statements echo the
guide's plea: "What will it take for
me to take a stand?"
Auerhahn contributed to many
articles in the guide, including an
account of last November's protest
in Seattle of the World Prade Or
ganization.
Freshmen who have had a
chance to peruse the Disorienta
tion Guide oiler largely apprecia
tive reactions.
"The heterosexuality test (Het
erosexual Questionnaire, found
on page 7) was very fresh and gave
you a good perspective on the way
homosexuals are treated," said
freshman Christopher Robinson.
Oneol the new features of this
year's guide is a color center col
lage depicting students in various
acts of resistance.
"I (.in identify with some of | the
banners], so they were powerful,"
said freshman Ami Kotte.
Some other students, especially
those who felt personally targeted
by the publication, were less in
dined to support the Disorienta
tion (iuide.
"I agree with almost everything

they say, but I can't align myself
with their specific movement be
cause the) make themselves into
outsiders," said freshman Noah
(irabowitz.
Hut that's exactly what Auer
hahn hopes the guide will accom
plish. She wants the guide to en
courage people to go outside of
the comlbrt /ones.
"We hope that [the guide] will
inspire students to think critically
about the issues and ideas present
ed, to discuss them with others,
and to take action," she said.
