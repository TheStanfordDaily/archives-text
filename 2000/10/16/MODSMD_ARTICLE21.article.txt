History professor calls
allegations inaccurate
I feel urgently compelled to respond to
Ariel Leichter-Maroko, who, in his letter
to The Daily ("Students find presentation
of Israeli / Palestinian conflict biased,"
Oct. 13), misquoted me, and wrongfully
questioned both my moral and intellectu
al integrity.
Concerning the teach-in on the Arab-
Israeli conflict sponsored by the History
Department the previous Wednesday,
Mr. Leichter-Maroko alleges that I "justi
fied" my choice of presenters by "c laiming
that one jew and one Arab sufficiently
span the spectrum of viewpoints on the
Palestinian rioting in Israel."
I absolutely and categorically deny
making that statement. To the contrary, I
openly acknowledged to the students tb.it
the panel was inadequate in its represen
tation of views.
I made myself available to students
after the event not to "justify" the panel,
but to listen to their frustrations.

History Department chair responds to
letters on teach-in
The letters to the editor printed in Fri
day's Daily continued the spirited and
contentious discussion that took place in
the previous Wednesday's teach-in on
Israel / Palestine. During the course of
that one-hour session, sharply divergent
views were exchanged; many students
told us afterwards that they found the
exchange informative and helpful.
Likewise, the letters to the editor con
tributed in important ways to readers'
understanding of the Israel / Palestine sit
uation and contained some legitimate
criticisms of the teach-in â€” boih kinds of
commentary continue the educational
function that was the session's purpose.
These are deeply tragic days in the
Middle East. It is not surprising that view
points are strong and emotions are run
ning high; speakers of whatever view
point were welcomed at the session, and
so were the feelings that accompanied
their statements.
It is regrettable, nonetheless, that both
at the session and afterwards disagree
ments boiled over, on the part of a few.

into abusive and rude treatment of the
faculty members who participated in the
session. In particular, the moderator,
Mary Louise Roberts, was attacked in per
son and in print in wholly inappropriate
ways. Hundreds of Stanford students
know her as one of the University's most
devoted and talented teachers. Her facul
ty colleagues know well, and affirm for
your readers, the commitment and
integrity she brings to the cause of Stan
ford education.

Med student laments attacks
on History Department
I his past Friday three letters in The
Daily devoted a tremendous amount of
verbiage towards harshly rriticizing our
History Department's recent Middle East
teach-in. 1 respect the students who wrote
these letters for articulating their views.
However, as a fellow classmate in this uni
