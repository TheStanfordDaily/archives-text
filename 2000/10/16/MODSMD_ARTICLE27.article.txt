# No. 1 Men's XC takes third place in Iowa
## 
### BEN ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It's lough to get an accurate read
on the No. 1 Stanford cross country
team these days. The squad that
looked like it was on cruise control
in back-to-back wins at the Stanford
and Notre Dame Invitationals en
countered a different fate this
weekend at the lowa State Memor
ial Cross Country Classic.
The Cardinal placed third, scor
ing 255 points to No. 3 Colorado's
winning talley of 64. Tenth-ranked
Northern Arizona slipped by Stan
lord as well, marking 215. The
meet served as a preview of the
NCIAA race which will take place on
the same course Nov. 20.
In their first 10-kilometer race of
the season, the Cardinal harriers
struggled to run as a pack. Stan
ford's five scorers were dispersed
over a gap of more than two min
utes, compared to the 18-second
spread over eight kilometers at
Notre Dame.
As usual, the leaders of the Stan
ford pack gathered up front, as the
Cardinal placed three runners in
the top eight. Seniors Thomas
Murley (30 minutes, 48.8 seconds)
,md Jonathon Riley (30:49.0) were
second and third, respectively,
while redshirt freshman Louis Lu
chini was eighth in 31:11.8.
But in a race with 360 competi

tors-the largest field Stanford will
face all year, int hiding at t he NC IAA
meet-the remainder of the Cardi
nal pack seemed to disintegrate.
By the time redshirt sophomore
Daniel Harris crossed the line in
69th place (32:07,3) <is Stanford's
fourth scorer, Colorado had al
ready sealed the victory. Sopho
more Set h Hejny was Stanford's
final scorer, placing 183 rd at
33:00.9.
Sophomore Adam Tenforde
was 226 th in 33:22.5, and sopho
more joe Urbanski was 236 th at
33:29.3.
Jorge Torres of Colorado was
the individual champion in
30:31.8.
The difficult read comes from
the fact that the Cardinal lineup has
thus far been malleable, changing
from week to week as coaches Vin
Lananna and Michael Reilly try to
solidify a top seven.
Case in point: Two of Stanford*s
top three finishers from last week's
race at Notre Dame, freshman
Donald Sage and redshirt frosh
Grant Robison, did not even make
the trip to lowa. And the racing sta
tus of Olympians Gabe Jennings
and Michael Stember remains
uncertain.
fhe lowa State meet was more
of a run-through for the Cardinal,
