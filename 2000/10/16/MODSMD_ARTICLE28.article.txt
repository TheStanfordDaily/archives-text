## Despite its early lead in the first quarter, the Cardinal loses to the Beavers this weekend 
### MATT LONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford traveled to Reser Stadium Satur
day on a two game losing streak and left un
able find any c racks in Oregon State's wall,
losing 38-f).
The No. 19 Beavers (5-1, 2-1 Pacific 10
(Conference) dominated the (Cardinal (2-4, 1 -
2) on both sides ol the ball, and Stanford was
unable to reach the end zone on any of its
three trips into the Oregon State red zone.
"What we've clone is missed opportuni
ties," said Stanford coach Tyrone Willing
ham. "You can't do that against an explosive
football team."
Meanwhile, the Oregon State offensive

machine switched gears alter a slight groin
injury to star tailback Ken Simonton. Erick
son used Simonton sparingly and relied
upon the accurate arm of senior quarterback
Jonathan Smith, a former walk-on who
passed for 324 yards and two touchdowns,
including a third quarter 97- yard touch
down toss lo Chad Johnson, an Oregon State
record.
The Cardinal struck first with a live
minute, 7- yard drive to the Heaver six yard
line, where senior Mike Biselli kicked a 24
yard field goal.
()regon State answered quickly and drove
behind Simonton, who marched them to the
Stanford 3. Patrick McCall crossed the end
/.one four plays into the second quarter, and
Oregon State took the lead for good. Simon
ton came into the game fourth in the nation
in rushing, but Krickson protected him from
the physical abuse his usual 35 carries a game
cause. He carried 14 times for SI yards, and
scored a 10-yard touchdown late in the third

quarter.
Stanford failed to reach Beaver territory
on its next possession, and, on the first play
after a Biselli punt, Smith found senior T.J.
Houshmandzadeh on an out pattern. Strong
safety Aaron Focht dove to intercept, but the
ball went between his outstretched hands
and Houshmandzadeh was oil to the races
fora 76-yard score for the Beavers.
On the ensuing kickoff, redshirt sopho
more Ryan Wells returned the ball SO yards
and was pushed out of bounds at the Oregon
State nine yard line. Stanford redshirt fresh
man quarterback Chris Lewis overthrew an
open Brett Pierce on third down, and Stan
ford was forced to settle fora 25 yard Biselli
kick. Lewis finished with IS of 33 passing for
ISS yards and two
interceptions.
The Beavers next drive ended with a ca
reer-long 49 yard field goal by Ryan Cesca,
and ihe game went to halftime
with Oregon State up 17-C>.
touchdowns l>\ |ohnson and
Simonton highlighted the third
quarter. Johnson's record-set
ting reception came alter a Bisel
li punt was downed b\ Stanlbrd
at the Heaver three yard line.
Johnson ran a streak and utilized
his 4.3 forty yard dash speed to
blow by coiner Ruben Carter
and wait/ untouched into the
end /one.
"I think we're the best re
ceivers in tlie l'ac-10," said
I loushmand/adeh. w ho finished
with 120 yards receiving. "We
knew we had to rebound off last
week's loss. II we execute everv
week, nobody can beat us."
Stanford's lone chance at a
second-half touchdown came at
the end of the third quarter.
Trailing 31-6, the Cardinal
fated a Beaver defense com
prised ol many second team
players, and Lewis led his team
to the two yard line with passes
to senior De√üonnie Pitts and
junior jamien McCullum.
But sophomore tailback Kern
Carter had the ball knocked
loose on a futile touchdown
dive and Oregon State recov
ered.
()regon State has now set I heir
sights on a possible Rose Bowl
berth, but with kev matchups
against I CLA and Oregon in the
future, their potent offense will
need the kind of performance it
had against Stanford to chal
lenge for the l'ac-10 title.
"We're still in the hunt, until
someone tells us we're out ol it."
said Erickson. "And no one's told
us we're out of the hunt
yet."
Stanford puts its bowl hopes
on the line next Saturday at
home against struggling I SC, a
28-1 7 loser to ()regon this week
end.
