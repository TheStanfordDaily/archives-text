a Cardinal squad determined to
defend its home turf.

fense, defense everyone played
well together."
The Cardinal clearly dominat
ed play on both sides of the field.

by a margin of 4-3, the Cardinal
defenders did not give the Quak
ers another opportunity. The de
fense, anchored wiili strong play
by Stai, did not allow a shot in the
second half.

the defense left off, tallying nine
shots in the second half It wasn't
until 25 minutes and 48 seconds
