# Frosh learning to deal without wheels
## 
### RAMIN SETOODEH 
While most first-year students are recovering
from leaving their parents and pets at home,
freshman Lynsie Ishimaru mourns the loss of
something entirely different: her new silver
2000 Prelude.
It's loaded with all the goods, ranging from a
state-of-the-art sound system to quality air bags
and a paint finish that sizzles.
Really sizzles.
Now she's traded her hot wheels for bicycle
wheels because of the recently instituted park
ing policy which doesn't allow freshmen to
bring cars to campus during their first three
quarters .it Stanford. Ishimaru is only one of
Itiany students who are discovering, following
their first three weeks as freshmen, that not
having access to a car has both positive and neg

ative aspects.
According to the I university's transportation
Web site, the no-car regulation was enacted be
cause campus "growth is limited by restrictions
contained in our current Cleneral Use Permit
with Santa Clara County- . . .limits are imposed
on the square footage of new buildings, parking
spaces and traffic."
To accommodate students without vehicles,
the University has developed additional public
transportation programs. I he free campus
shuttle, the Marguerite, has expanded its
routes, traveling to San Antonio Shopping ('en
ter and downtown Palo Alto. There is also a new
Midnight Express shuttle service, which oper
ates past midnight on weeknights and trans
ports students around campus and into the
downtown Palo Alto area.
Freshman Mike Brzo/owski said he finds ser

vices like the Marguerite very helpful.
"1 think having a car is highly overrated. I'm
actually glad I don't have one'on campus," Br
/o/owski s,iid. "Realistically, I have a Iree shuttle
tli.it goes to Wal-Mart and the Caltrain, and the
Internet can deliver most anything else to my
door, so what do 1 need a car for?"
lot freshmen — and upper-class students
— interested in renting a vehicle, on-campus
cat rentals from Enterprise are available at the
Stanford Bookstore. The company oilers a 15 to
l J() percent discount to students. Ihe rental
price starts from %'M) lot a (ieo Metro.
Additionally, the transportation office has
implemented a new Emergency Ride Pro
gram. Its purpose is to provide a way back to
campus for freshmen who are accidentally
stranded. The program will ser
vice areas within an 8-mile radius
of the university. More informa
tion about the program, which re
quires an application process, can
be accessed online.
Many freshmen admit that the
new regulation lias not caused
them problems.
"I've never had a car, and the

public transportation is a big im
provement over what we had in
Miami, so I'm actually doing a lot
better here," freshman Nathalie
Cassidy said.
Despite the alternatives, some
students are still dreaming of their
wheels back at home.
I miss my car, "Isimaru said.
"Ill immediately need something
from the store, it's quite different
to get there in an efficient
manner."
Freshman Michael Neruda,
who is in Reserve (Mlicer Training

Corps, said that not having a vehi
cle on campus puts him at a major
disadvantage.
"It would be a lot easier for me if
I had a car to get to Berkeley on
Thursdays," he said.
Of course, there are those few
lucky students, like freshman
Sarah Jane Doty, who manage to
sidestep all public transportation
and still get around with ease.
"My brother is a junior here,
and lie has a car; so I can't imagine
Stanford lilt* without a car,"
Doty said.
