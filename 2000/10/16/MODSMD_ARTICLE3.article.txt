### RAMIN SETOODEH 
While most first-year students are recovering
from leaving their parents and pets at home,
freshman Lynsie Ishimaru mourns the loss of
something entirely different: her new silver
2000 Prelude.
It's loaded with all the goods, ranging from a
state-of-the-art sound system to quality air bags
and a paint finish that sizzles.
