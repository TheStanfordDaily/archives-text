# Inexperienced Lewis leads stuggling Card
## The 						young Cardinal squad buries hopes for the Rose Bowl awaits return of Fasani

Well, it's sale to sav at this
point that Stanford tans can go
ahead and make their New
Year's Day plans because the
Cardinal aren't heading lor a
howl anywhere near Jan. 1 after
the 2000 season.
No, this time around it's the
Oregon State Beavers who are
becoming the surprise of the Pa
< if it 10 Conlerence, shocking
opponents with an explosive of
fense and.i defense that is grow
ing more stout by the game. And
alter Saturday's ,'iB-() thrashing
ol the Cardinal, the Beavers
may be on the way to smelling
the Roses themselves lot the first
time since l ( .)(>f>.
11 must have been eerily rem
iniscent ol last year lor Stanford
head coach I \ rone W'illingham,
as he watched unheralded ()Sl
quarterback Jonathan Smith
lolt beautiful spirals to a fleet of
speech receivers, as the defense
watched helplessly.
1 he days ol Todd I Insak to
I roy Wallers are gone, howev
er, and in his third game as a
starter, redshirt freshman OB
( In is Lewis wasn't able lo move
the Cardinal offense with any
where near the efficiency he
demonstrated against I ex.is
lour weeks ago. Against OSU,
Lewis showed the growing pains
thai Stanford coaches and fans
alike have endured lor his two

oilier starting outings but with
out significant progress.
lo be lair, it's a bit much to
ask of a player in his lburth
game to play up to the level of a
future National Football League
quarterback, but things still
seem to be moving too last for
the former Long Beach Poly
star. Lewis isn't getting much
help from his young receivers
either. De√üonnie Pitts is fating
constant double teaming, and
the offensive line hasn't given
him the consistent protection he
needs to make his reads.
l lie result was a very conser
vative game plan against the
Beavers, built on getting good
rushes out of the running back
tandem of Kerry Carter and
Brian Allen rather than putting
the burden on Lewis' back. Cel
ling only three yards a carry, as
the Cardinal RBs did, doesn't
give that plan a good chance lor
success.
Fortunately for W'illingham
(and perhaps Lewis), there is re
lief on the way in the broad
shoulders of quarterback Randy
Fasani, who has recovered from
the knee injury that knocked
him out against Texas a month
ago. Fasani actually received
medical clearance to play in
Corvallis, but W'illingham ap
parently elected to not take a
chance on the artificial turf in
Reser Stadium.
F.ven though no announce
ment has been made, it seems
sale to assume that Fasani, a red
shin junior, will be back to take
on struggling I JSC at Stanford
Stadium this Satin day. Whether
Fasani ran actually be the differ
ence between further misery or
a morale-boosting win is some
thing that everyone will have to
wait and see.
