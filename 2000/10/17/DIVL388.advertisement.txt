The first big step in becoming an organ donor is making the decision to do so. But that decision
alone doesn t guarantee that your wishes will be followed. What many people don't know

take place Without that consent, it simply won't happen. Please don't let a wonderful
decision go to waste Talk to your family about donating your organs. Talk to your family about
donating life For more information, visit www shareyourlife.org or call 1 -800-355-SHARE.
