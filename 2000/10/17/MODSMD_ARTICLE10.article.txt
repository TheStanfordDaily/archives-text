Crush of campus-crime
data crashes system
I'he U.S. Department of Education announced Fri
day that it was extending by one week, to Oct. 24, the
deadline for colleges and universities to report their
campus-crime statistics to the department.
In August, the department, under new federal re
quirements, began a national, Internet-based collection
of 6,000 institutions' crime statistics for the years 1997,
1998, and 1999.
The deadline had been set for today, but as of Fri
day, fewer than half of the institutions — only 2,600 --
had submitted their data. Over the past several weeks,
many campus officials have complained that they've
found the department's Web-based server busy, or
been bumped off the system. The department has been
working to resolve those issues.
