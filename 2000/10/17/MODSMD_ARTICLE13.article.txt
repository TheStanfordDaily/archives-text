1952
On October 17, 1952. The Daily report
ed on vandalism involving to an upcoming
election.
"Two prominent Stanford Young Re
publicans, one a ranking ollicer in (he state
organization, were arraigned in Redwood
(;ity police court yesterday on charges ol
malicious mischief alter they were caught
allegedly trying to destroy a large Democ
ratic Party poster at Five Points.. . .
"Earl Specer, president of the San
Mateo Young Republicans (of which the
Stanford dub is a part), said last night,
'Young Republicans neither advocate nor
encourage any act of political vandalism or
malicious mischief.'
"I le further stated, 'Individual youthful
enthusiasm should not be confused with
tlu- constructive, organized activities of the
San Mateo Young Republicans.' "
Bottom Line: If only these Young Republicans
had seen the real political damage that could
be done by unleashing Bill Maher on stage with
a microphone.
