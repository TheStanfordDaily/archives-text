## Arafat, Barak meet amid Mideast tension 
### 
SHARM EL-SHEIK, Egypt
(AP) — In an atmosphere of high
tension and mistrust, Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Pales
tinian leader Yasser Arafat met
warily at an emergency summit
yesterday aimed ai halting bloody
clashes in the Mideast. "We cannot
afford to fail," President Clinton
warned.
After 12 hours of talks, there
was no agreement or claims of
progress. The leaders met over a
late dinner while their foreign
ministers talked separately. White
House officials left open the possi
bility that (ilinton could extend his
stay until today, rather than
departing late yesterday. "Things
have been intense," Clinton's
spokesman said.
The main hangup was Arafat's
insistence for an international fact
finding commission to assess the
causes of the violence, an Israeli
official said. Israel says ii will only
accept a panel led by the United
States, its closest ally.
Barak, meanwhile, insisted on a
halt to Palestinian attacks on
Israeli soldiers and civilians and
the re-arrest of extremists from
the Hamas and Islamic jihad
movements who were released this
past week. He has called for the
Palestinian media to stop its calls
for further attacks against Israel.
Clinton implored both sides "to
move beyond blame" after more
than two weeks of armed clashes
on the West Bank and Gaza that
have left about 100 people dead.

most of them Palestinians, ft has
been the worst Israeli-Palestinian
violence since 1993, when the ()slo
peace accords launched the now
shattered peace process.
Fighting flared anew less than
an hour alter the summit
opened. Israeli soldiers opened
fire at Palestinian gunmen and
rock-throwers. A Palestinian
police officer was killed and
dozens of civilians were wounded
by Israeli fire.
Surrounded by tight security,
the leaders met at a two-story golf
clubhouse at this Red Sea resort,
famous for its coral reefs and
scuba diving. They gathered
around a horseshoe-shaped table,
Arafat and Barak sitting away
from other leaders and far apart
from each other.
"It's tough going — painstak
ing work," a senior administration
official said.
There were no smiles or hand
shakes for the cameras, but offi
cials said the two men did shake
hands. Their attitude toward each
other was described as chilly.
There were flashes of anger in a
foreign ministers' meeting on
another floor.
Gadi Baltiansky, Barak's
spokesman, said there were "sub
stantial difficulties" in the foreign
ministers' negotiations and that
any agreement would have to be
decided by the leaders.
Fhe differences are, on the one
hand, the insistence by Palestini
ans that the Israelis take steps on

the ground before a full stop to the
violence, something Israel objects
to; And, on the other hand, the
character of a body that would
investigate the events lias not been
agreed upon," Baltiansky said.
Clinton tried to bridge differ
ences between the leaders, lie
spoke at length with Barak, then
Arafat and then Barak again,
and was planning to see Arafat
later.
The summit was hosted by
Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, who unmistakabb
blamed Israel for the violence.
"The aggressions to which the
Palestinian people were subjected
during the last two weeks per
suaded me to convene this meet
ing," Mubarak said.
Also participating were King
Abdullah of Jordan. U.N. Secre
tary-General Kofi Annan and
Javier Solatia, the European
Union's foreign affairs chief.
Asked how the talks were proceed
ing, Annan cautiously responded:
"Reasonably well."
At one point, the foreign minis
ters' meeting erupted in acrimony.
Israeli Foreign Minister Slilo
mo Ben Ami told the chief Pales
tinian negotiator, Saeb Frekat,
that the international inquin
being sought In Arafat was simply
an alibi to prevent progress in the
peace process, according to an
Israeli official familiar with the
talks.
The official, who spoke on con
dition of anonymity, said Frekat

responded, "You are a real hero,
threatening us with guns."
Secretary of Madeleine
Albright persuaded both to con
tinue talking.
Clinton refused to take sides.

Saying the situation was "piled
high with grievance," Clinton said,
"we have got to move beyond
blame."
Urging the parties to be "sober
and serious," he set out three

goals: To end the violence and
restore securitv cooperation; to
agree upon a fact-finding process
about what happened "to bring us
to this sad point," and to get the
peace process going again.
