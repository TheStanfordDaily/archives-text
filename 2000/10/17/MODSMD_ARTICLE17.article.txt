ADEN, Yemen (AP) — With Ameri
can officials stung In the ease that appar
ent suicide bombers attacked the I SS
Cole, Yemeni security forces vesterdav
interrogated do/ens of port workers and
others — including the head of the com
pany that services I .S. warships.
Ahmed al-Mansoob, general manager
of the Al-Mansoob Commercial Croup
that provides food, supplies and garbage
pickup to the U.S. warships, was
released yesterda\ after two cl,i\s of
questioning. The two crew members of
the garbage barge assigned to the Cole
were also brought in and later freed.
Al-Mansoob would not speak to
reporters. But Abdullah Al-khalaqi,
marketing director for the Yemeni com
pany, denied anv connection to the
attack last week that killed 17 American
sailors.
"No one here is an extremist," he said
in an office filled with caps, mugs and
notes of thanks from visiting U.S. ships.
"Most of our emplovees are relatives,"
said al-Khalaqi. "For others, we rely on
word of mouth to see if someone is a

good man."
Several people remained in a highly
guarded c amp on Aden's outskirts, but it
was unclear whether they were consid
ered suspects in the explosion that tore a
4()-by-4()-foot hole in the destroyer.
Yemen now considers the blast "a
premeditated criminal ac t," according to
SABA, the official Yemeni news agency,
a reversal of an earlier position that is
c ruc ial to the investigation. Yemeni Pres
ident Ali Abdullah Saleh's backing is vital
m allowing FBI agents and other I.S.
terrorism experts to work closely with
Yemeni authorities.
Saleli met with the head of the U.S.
Central Command, Ceil. Tommy
Franks, to review military cooperation
and evidence gathered by Yemeni secu
rity forces, SABA said.
"The president expressed his deep
regret and sorrow for this criminal act
against our country and against the
United States of America,"the agency
.id* led.
There has been no credible claim of
responsibility for the deadliest terrorist

attack on the U.S. military sim e the 199<
bombing of an Air l orcc barracks in
Saudi Arabia that killed 19.
"We will track them down," Defense
Secretary William Cohen said. "We owe
that to the families."
Franks toured the crippled Cole yes
terday and spoke to exhausted crew
members. They seemed finally to haw
gained the upper hand in keeping the
warship afloat. I mil dawn Sunday, the\
had continued to try to bail out a Hood
ed bulkhead, with electrical shorts
knocking out power. At one point, they
jury-rigged a pumping system from port
side fire fighting equipment.
By yesterday, most flooding was con
tained and conditions on board
improved.
"Heroic eilbrts were undertaken b\
the crew . . . they saved the ship," said
Rear Adm. Mark Fit/gerald, head of the
U.S. task force at the ship.
Li. Terrence Dudley, a spokesman
for the U.S. sth Fleet, said electi icily and
air conditioning had been restored.
Temperatures have been in the 90s.
