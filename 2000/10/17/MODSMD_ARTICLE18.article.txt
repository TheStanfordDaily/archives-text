# Chevron to buy out Texaco
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Chevron Corp. is buy
ing Texaco Inc. in a $!V4 billion deal that is likely to
run into tougher-than-usual
antitrust resistance because of high gas prices lately.
The deal, announced yesterday, would create the
world's fourth-largest oil company.
Analysts expect Chevron Texaco Corp. to win reg
ulatory approval in six months to a year, but only
after it sells several refineries and hundreds of gas sta
tions, primarily in the West and the South.
Without such divestitures, the combined company
would control 40 percent of the West Coast retail mar
ket and one-third of the region's refinery capacity.
" There are going to be some considerable chal
lenges to getting this deal done," said oil industry
analyst Tyler Dann of Banc of America Securities in
Houston. "They need to take a pre-emptive strike
and sell assets to satisfy regulators as soon as possible
or ii could turn into a real political f<>otball."
The combined company will also cut about 7 per
cent of its work force — about 4,000 workers — to
help it save an estimated $1.2 billion annually.
In si/.e, Chevron, based in San Francisco, and Tex
aco, based in White Plains, N.Y., will still lag behind
Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch/Shell Group and
BP Amoco PL('. — industry powerhouses also formed
by recent mergers.
But the rules of the game have changed dramati
cally since the first wave of industry deals in 1998,
when oil prices were declining to their lowest levels in

a generation.
Through most of this year, oil prices have been
climbing steadily, driving gas prices to record highs in
some parts of the country and increasing pressure to
get things under control.
" The pressure is building on oil companies. This
deal is going to get a lot of scrutiny," said Stephen
Smith, an analyst with Dain Rauscher Wessels in
I touslon.
"The amount of attention given a merger when
gas is $1.20 per gallon is not the same amount of
attention given when it's approaching $2 per gallon.''
he said. "It's going to be a much tougher climate."
When Exxon Mobil Corp. was approved last
year, it had to sell a California refinery and nearly
2,500 gas stations, primarily in the East. BP Amoco
had to sell holdings in Alaska to buy Atlantic Rich
field Co.
The most recent merger talks between 1 exaco and
Chevron began at a time when Texaco's stock had
been lackluster and the company was under press to
improve shareholder returns.
Chevron chief executive David O'Reilly said exec
utives are prepared fi>r an extensive government
review of the merger, and he predicted quick regula
tory approval.
"I think this is a politically good time to address the
issue," he said. "We will Ix- able to provide energv to
U.S. consumers in a better way than we could have
done separately."
