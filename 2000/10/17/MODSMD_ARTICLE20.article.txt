## The 						Stanford Daily History Department teach-in was misbilled 
### 
Published Since 1891

WHEN STUDENTS ARRIVED at
Wednesday's History Depart
ment teach-in, they expected a
balanced perspective of the cur
rent Middle East outbreak. What they got
instead was a strongly pro-Palestinian view
point, offered without a corresponding Zion
ist viewpoint.
The History Department was wrong to bill
such a clearly slanted event as a neutral pre
sentation. Given the volatility of the issue, the
teach-in organizers should have made clear in
posters and e-mails that the pro-Arab point of
view would predominate.
The conflict in the Middle East is one of the
most long-standing international conflicts,
and it becomes increasingly pressing every
day, particularly in light of the most recent
eruptions of violence and the ever-flagging

peace talks. That said, the nature of the
Mideast crisis renders it one of the most
nuanced and complicated issues of world
affairs, an extremely difficult one for students
and scholars alike to unpack and examine.
Meritorious arguments exist on both sides,
and observers would be foolish to suggest that
these arguments can be neatly organized into
right and wrong.
It is within the context of these shades of
gray that the teach-in could have been most
valuable. Most students, like the majority of
the American public, are woefully underedu
cated on the Mideast crisis, leading them to
form uninformed or biased opinions or not to
care at all. The History Department rightly
recognized the dire need for education on
this issue, and those professors involved
should be commended for their attempts to

meet that need.
However, no matter how good the organiz
er's intentions, the teach-in itself failed to live
up to its title — "Crisis in Israel / Palestine:
Thinking Historically about Current F.vents"
— which seems to imply, at the very least, ;i
hearty attempt at objectivity and equal repre
sentation of views. Had the department billed
the event under a different title, reflecting the
bias inherent in the choice of speakers, the
resulting teach-in would have been ;i success,
for students would have been well aware of
the event's slant. As it stood, though, the
teach-in only effectivelv offered half the story,
depriving those students with genuine inter
est of as complete a view its possible.
In spite of all the teach-in s problems, stu
dents misjudged the appropriateness of boo
ing and hissing at the speakers, because such

behavior certainly (foes not belong in any
legitimate academic discussion. With an issue
as contentious as this one, standpoints will
always be wide, varied and even aggressive,
but that is preciseh the kind of diversity of
opinion Stanford, a> an institution, ought to
encourage. Students should not let their per
sonal feelings about given issues stand in the
wav of their ability to listen to and learn from
oi hers.
The state ol aflairs in the Middle East is a
subject of passionate interest to students. I he
I listorv Department offered a valuable service
to meet that interest by providing a teach-in.
Unfortunately, the department undercut its
own efforts b\ failing to provide an accurate
description of its own event. In the end, a
valuable teaching opportunity wlost in the
semantic sliullle.
