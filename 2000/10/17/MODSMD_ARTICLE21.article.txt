# I HAVE ISSUES
## Political re-orientation 
### DANIEL KEMPER DONA VAN STAFF COLUMNIST 
-w- ast week, I tackled the problem
of intellet lual apafliv on the
Stanford campus, while this week
-JL—JI turn to the timely issue of polit
ical apathy.
As election day approaches, apathy is a
term often used to describe voters' atti
tudes toward the political scuffling
between presidential candidates Bore

and Gush. However,
Stanford's political
apathy reaches back far
before this election.
For me, it goes back
about two years.
Picture it: Stanford,
Fall Quarter 1998. 1
am sitting in a pre-
Staßu Collo that is
self-con s c i o us 1 y

attempting to be grungy. Stanford in
Government still holds weekly "Political
Coffee Honrs" at the CoHo in which stu
dents are invited to come and discuss a
specific political topic, such as the media's
role in politics. Sitting in on the rousing
three-person Coffee Hour, my first, I
come to the realization that most Stan
ford students couldn't care less about cur
rent political events.
Almost no Political Coffee Hour has
been attended by more than four or five
people, and at least two or three of those
people have been SIC members. As a vice
c hair of SIC this year and a member of
SIG for three years, I have personally wit
nessed this chronic low attendance. I
believe that the low attendance of Political
Coffee Hours is one of many indications
of long-term political apathy on campus.
The problem is orientational. Stanford
campus culture is primarily future-orient
ed, as a result of the undergraduate
emphasis on pre-professional planning.
Overwhelming numbers of students at
Stanford plan to move directly from the
undergraduate to the professional world
as programmers, consultants, investment
bankers, engineers and entrepreneurs.
This is not to say that no one goes to
graduate school. But it seems to me that
the dominant atmosphere on campus is
pre-professional, largely because the pro
fessionals themselves have the power
(money) to aggressively promote the pre
professional track via career fairs, recruit
ment dinner, informational meetings
and pecuniar) enticements. Stanford's
location in Silicon Valley and the attrac

tiveness of Stanford graduates for profes
sional companies exacerbates the
situation.
It is no coincidence that those who
attend a McKinsey & Company dinner
are unlikely to attend a Mumia rally in
San Francisco the next day. Those
focused on achieving a specific life situa
tion in the distant or not-too-distant
future tend to focus their present-day
energies on achieving that future state.
A more positive college scenario is one
in which a student is uncertain of what
the future holds. As one learns, one
changes, and usually one's goals change
accordingly. Thus I argue that a healthi
er student mindset includes not a pre
determined future but a constantly ques
tioned, flexible present and future. Exist
ing in a more present-based state of
mind, the college student focuses on pre
sent-day issues and how they affect him
or her. Current political events, there
fore, play a relevant role in the student's
life.
Mindset is not an exogenous variable;
each person is capable of controlling the
way he or she thinks. I propose that Stan
ford students make an effort to think
more about what they are learning in
their classes in terms of how it affects
them as individuals, rather than how it
affects their predetermined future
careers. There's nothing wrong with leav
ing a little room for flexibility in the
future.
I do not necessarily wish to see more
students attend rallies and demonstra
tions. Indeed, I'm not even sure if public
demonstrations are the best method of
political expression. I would be happy if
more students simply looked at cnn.com
ever) day or discussed politics over din
ner out of concern for what is happening
outside Stanford.
General awareness of the world is a
prerequisite for making any sort of
change in that world. If our eyes are
focused only on the future there will
never be any place for change. ()ur atten
tion will be absorbed by considering a
fixed state — what will be — rather than
a changeable state that can be improved
right here, right now.
I realize I run the risk of sounding
wluny, and many of you may ask what
right I have to berate other students
when I haven't proven that I am any dif
ferent from the typical apathetic Stan

lord student. Well, an idea fora new SICi
program came out of the Political C of fee
I lour held two years ago at the (ol 10.
1 he SKI members present asked them
selves how they could possibly exploit the
pre-prolessional altitude at Stanlbrd lor the
purposes ol politics. I he solution was the
Political Fellows Program, a group whose
name sounds sullic iently impressive to put
on a resume. I ,ast year, as a director of SI( i,
I inaugurated the program, in which
approximately 10 to 12 students were
brought together to disc uss political issues
.iiid meet with local political leaders to pro

mote interest in politics. Ihe group even
attempted to disseminate some ol its politi
cal knowledge and enthusiasm to the Stan
iord campus in the form of a newsletter.
The Political Fellows Program will
continue this year. Furthermore, Sl(i will
continue with a project it started late last
year, the Civic Awards program, in whit h
students on campus are honored for their
political / civic prowess, just as athletes are
honored each week lor their physical
prowess. 1 hope that these two projects
will help to bolster an interest in politics
on campus, but I think the greatest
change will come at the level of the indi
vidual: that is, you.
