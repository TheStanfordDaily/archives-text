Stanford West apartments too expensive
In the past weeks, I have seen several
interviews from John Cammidge, the
new executive director of human
resources, in which the new Stanford
West Apartments are used as an example
of how Stanford is trying to improve the
housing situation.
When 1 first heard about this initiative,
I was very excited: a decent plat e to live at
an affordable price. As with all things too
good to Ix 1 true, if you read the fine print
you will discover that the reality is quite
different.
It was a real disappointment to discov
er that the cost fora three-bedroom apart
ment is around $3,000 with a required
ratio between rent and salary below 35
percent. This means that if you are mak
ing less than $100,000 a year, forget about
the apartments. The qualifications for the
below-market rate are really low.
Hey, these are market prices, but
where are our market salaries? The park
ing permits were increased almost 30 per
cent this year and the benefit office service
is poor, to be politically correct.
If this is how they try to keep people,
they will be lucky to hold the 25 percent
turnover rate.
Basically, what Stanford is telling peo
ple with a family and a single income is
"go and look fora new job." This is very
short-sighted political thinking. In the
long term, all the skilled people will leave
for "market" jobs.
I like my jobs, but I have the impres

sion that Stanford cares more about side
walks than emplovees.

Palo Alto resident calls Stanford JCC plan
"strong arm tactics"
With the |CC / middle school land
swap, Stanford is manipulating us into
buying a bill of goods that we don't neces
sarily want.
Of course, I want a solution to the
problem of the overcrowded middle
schools. I have three children, two of
whom are in Palo Alto schools. I he situ.i
tion in the middle schools is desperate. I
want a solution now.
And the Jewish ( .omnumit\ ('.enter is
an asset. I have used many of their facili
ties. South Palo Alto definitely needs the
kind of community center they provide.
Their services should be preserved.
But the proposed solution, with Stan
ford swooping down like ;i magician and
waving a magic wand to solve all our prob
lems, does not come without cost. None of
us are naive enough to think that Stanford
would do this for free. But they're .isking
for approval of a 10-year (ieneral I se Plan
in the form "that is acceptable to Stanford
in its sole discretion."
This means that Stanford can disre
gard all of the input and comment it
received from local city and countv gov

crnmenis, apply for any level of building
that ii desires and know tli.it it will he
approved. II Stanford's General Use Plan
is not approved in a form that Stanford
likes — the deal is of 11
Why is this an issue? Because Stanford
wants to do a tremendous amount of
growth ovet the next 10 years, including
building into the open space west ol
Junipero Serra, increasing academic and
research space withoui increasing housing
at the same rate and building on the habi
tat ol the threatened California Tiger
Salamander. I hey were getting some
politic al flak in the process of getting their
(d I' approved. Main believe that the
open space should be permanenth pro
let ted as mitigation for the level of growth
Stanford has planned.
So now with the their "magic'' solution
to the middle school / Jewish Community
( enter problem Stanford believes that they
have lound a carrot t<x> big to resist. And
they will use it to lead us into approving a
CI P that can disregard regional planning
process and communitv input. Thev may

problems. We might have to take their car

tactics on the part of Stanford, and that we
will pav for our short term solution with
long-term qualm of life problems.

Stanford West apartments too expensive
In the past weeks, I have seen several
interviews from John Cammidge, the
new executive director of human
resources, in which the new Stanford
West Apartments are used as an example
of how Stanford is trying to improve the
housing situation.
When 1 first heard about this initiative,
I was very excited: a decent plat e to live at
an affordable price. As with all things too
good to Ix 1 true, if you read the fine print
you will discover that the reality is quite
different.
It was a real disappointment to discov
er that the cost fora three-bedroom apart
ment is around $3,000 with a required
ratio between rent and salary below 35
percent. This means that if you are mak
ing less than $100,000 a year, forget about
the apartments. The qualifications for the
below-market rate are really low.
Hey, these are market prices, but
where are our market salaries? The park
ing permits were increased almost 30 per
cent this year and the benefit office service
is poor, to be politically correct.
If this is how they try to keep people,
they will be lucky to hold the 25 percent
turnover rate.
Basically, what Stanford is telling peo
ple with a family and a single income is
"go and look fora new job." This is very
short-sighted political thinking. In the
long term, all the skilled people will leave
for "market" jobs.
I like my jobs, but I have the impres

sion that Stanford cares more about side
walks than emplovees.

Palo Alto resident calls Stanford JCC plan
"strong arm tactics"
With the |CC / middle school land
swap, Stanford is manipulating us into
buying a bill of goods that we don't neces
sarily want.
Of course, I want a solution to the
problem of the overcrowded middle
schools. I have three children, two of
whom are in Palo Alto schools. I he situ.i
tion in the middle schools is desperate. I
want a solution now.
And the Jewish ( .omnumit\ ('.enter is
an asset. I have used many of their facili
ties. South Palo Alto definitely needs the
kind of community center they provide.
Their services should be preserved.
But the proposed solution, with Stan
ford swooping down like ;i magician and
waving a magic wand to solve all our prob
lems, does not come without cost. None of
us are naive enough to think that Stanford
would do this for free. But they're .isking
for approval of a 10-year (ieneral I se Plan
in the form "that is acceptable to Stanford
in its sole discretion."
This means that Stanford can disre
gard all of the input and comment it
received from local city and countv gov

crnmenis, apply for any level of building
that ii desires and know tli.it it will he
approved. II Stanford's General Use Plan
is not approved in a form that Stanford
likes — the deal is of 11
Why is this an issue? Because Stanford
wants to do a tremendous amount of
growth ovet the next 10 years, including
building into the open space west ol
Junipero Serra, increasing academic and
research space withoui increasing housing
at the same rate and building on the habi
tat ol the threatened California Tiger
Salamander. I hey were getting some
politic al flak in the process of getting their
(d I' approved. Main believe that the
open space should be permanenth pro
let ted as mitigation for the level of growth
Stanford has planned.
So now with the their "magic'' solution
to the middle school / Jewish Community
( enter problem Stanford believes that they
have lound a carrot t<x> big to resist. And
they will use it to lead us into approving a
CI P that can disregard regional planning
process and communitv input. Thev may
Im 1 right —thc)>eopleoi Palo Alto are des
perate for .1 solution to these two very real
problems. We might have to take their car
rot. Hut I believeth.it these are strong-arm
tactics on the part of Stanford, and that we
will pav for our short term solution with
long-term qualm of life problems.
