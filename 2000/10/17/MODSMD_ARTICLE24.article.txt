## Souks, drugs and rock and roll: America's cultural legacy 
### MATTHEW BENTLEY GUEST COLUMNIST 
Amid the ancient souks ol Mar
rakech, where < arpet peddlers,
snake-charmers and hustlers
alike do a brisk trade with
tourists, the hottest item going is a
jumbo-si/ed pair ol green gangsta' pants
worn by a befuddled American punk
teenager tra\eling with his family Shop
keepers swarm around him, ollering
line Moroccan jewelry, woodcarvings
and leather.
His parents are horribh confused.
" 1 liey're such ugly pants!' the\ com
plain to me. "I hope he does gel rid of
them."
But, at some level, they understand
that there's something deeph troubling
about all of it, that these surreal moments
don't match up with the images on the
gloss\ tourist brochures, or the Morocco
thex imagined ;»s the land of ('.asahlanca

and the Arabian nights.
I watch the iamily get swallowed up
amid the confusion of the souk. Some
Moroccan carpet-weaver will probably be
spoiling a new pair of gangsta' pants
tomorrow, and the world will be that
much smaller. At least gangsta' pants will
go well with the Nikes and Starter caps
that seem to be last season's hits.
I bis cacophony of tangled cultural
identities, corporate icons and corrupted
imagery best represents America's cul
tural legacv. But don't expect anyone to
acknowledge th.it the) take tashion
advice from the country that invented
Mi ( .ulturc. It's a sad stale ol ailairs: Few
would argue that America today has a
rich culture, yet that doesn't stop us
from spreading it around the globe like
a plague.
In the industrial world of yesteryear,
hegemony was a function of the land and
resources a country had carved out for
itself. Foday, it's mind-share that counts.

I lie miracle of the Information Age is
that American pop crap can he dissemi
nated instantly all over the world.
And what a lead we've taken. If yon
think America dominated at the
Olympics, you should see the numbers
on entertainment exports. It's becom
ing impossible to find people who
haven't heard of Friends, 'N Sync or
The Lion King. Even Iranians defy the
regime to plug in fora daily fix of Bay
watch. And Edith Piaf would be rolling
in her grave il she knew that the hot
concert in Paris this year is Britney
Spears's upcoming show.
I'm still hoping fora major I lollywood
entertainment mogul to come forward
and conless, "Sorry, world — we were
just messin' with you .... We'll start mak
ing something worthwhile now, 1 swear."
Instead, the world continues its
strange love-hate affair with American
pop culture. On the one hand, there is a
fascination with all things I S.A. Whether

it's Morocc an carpet-sellers buying gangs
la' pants to keep up with the latest fashion
trends or American-inspired gangs in
France with cheesy English names like
"Dark Stallions' or "Bad Boy/." On the
other hand, even Canada looks down its
nose .it the vacuity of American culture.
Some countries have dec lared all-out war
on Mickey Mouse and the Golden Arches:
For example, "cultural ministers" in
Fiance have enacted laws requiring that
40 percent of airtime be reserved for
domestic artists. Passions have even been
aroused to the point of violence. In the
most famous case, a Roquefort-wielding
sheep farmer from southwestern France
became a national hero when he led a
trac tor assault on Ronald McDonald's fast
food fortress.
Such revolts may seem silly from the
American perspective. After all. no one is
forcing French teenagers to buy Fminem
compact diiscs, so why not let them do as
they please?

Imagine whal would happen it the sit
uation were reversed. Sudden!) Ameri
can culture is no longer the default
"world culture," but a mere sliver ol com
mon identity in the late ola mass cultur
al onslaught from, say, Canada. Would
we pass laws to eliminate "eh and
"aboot" from the American dialect, ban
The Kids in the Hall and upend trucks
carrying Canadian bacon?
Ridiculous though it may seem, an
America caught in an identity crisis could
easily stoop to such measures. The mote
the world opens up. the more vehement
ly nations will light to preserve their
culture.
Hut in the meantime, the best we can
do is to enhance our knowledge and
appreciation lor the grand diversity ol
cultures. That's why 1 left that Moroccan
souk cloaked in a brand new diet la ha.
