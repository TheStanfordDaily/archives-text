## Cal bears down on No. 20 soccer, 2-0 
### WENDI WHITMAN 
Entering Sunday's game, tlie
No. 20 Stanford women's s<xcet
team knew that n would have to as
sert itself in order to beat No. 10 Cal
ifornia on the Colden Bears home
field, where tliev were a per let! ">-()
on the season.
1 lowever, 29 total fouls— 15 lot
Stanford and I 1 lor Cal — along
with loin yellow cards (three issued
to Cal players and one issued to a
Stanford plaver) might be the most
telling stats following this vear's
women's sorter Big Came, as Cal
handed Stanford a 2-0 loss.
Both teams knew that this vear's
contest would be typical of the al
wavs-phvsical meetings between the
two rivals, which employ two dis
tinct styles ol plav. Stanford usually
tries to control games bv imposing
its own passing sixle. The Bears
prefer a more direct, pli\ sical st\ le.
Stanford went into the matchup
knowing it would need to move the
ball well offensively and be able to
absorb Cal's physical pressure on
defense.

But, for the third year in a row,
( al's combative si\le won out over
Stanford's finesse as the Bears
notched the victory in front ol 1 .582
fans, the largest crowd ever at Cal's
Edwards Stadium. With the loss,
Stanford fell to 8-4-1 for the season
and 1-2-0 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence while Cal improved to 12-1-1
ovei all and 2-1-0 in the I'ac 10.
The Cardinal began the game
strong, dominating possession
throughout the first 20 minutes. A
kev save by senior goalkeeper (larly
Smolak in the fourth minute
seemed to stabilize the defense for
the Cardinal.
(Mlensively, the ('.ardinal moved
the ball well, but was never able to
penetrate the Bears' veteran de
lense and was unable to take any
dangerous shots on senior goal

"We just didn't play to our
strengths today and so we weren't
able to exploit them very much,"
said senior co-captain Shauna Itri.

opportunistic rebound oil her own
shot after a g<HKl save In Smolak to
give the Bears a 1-0 lead.
Instead of responding to the goal
by pit king up its pressure, the Car
dinal seemed to get more frustrated
by the Bears' disruptive style. As (lal
took over with dim t balls, Stanford
lost its oflensive rhythm and strug
gled to retain possession. The Car
dinal got caught up in physical bat
ik's and wasn't able to probe the
Bear defense lor holes to exploit.
"When they pla\. it's like thev are
on a last track straight to the goal,
whereas we like to knock the ball
around a bit. 1 he\ played their type
of physical game better than we
played our game today, and it
showed," said senior co-captain
Christ) I ,a Pierre.
In the second hall, the Cardinal
became impatient as it pressed to
equalize the score. At the ()7 min
utes, 44-second mark into the

match, freshman forward Brittany
()liviera replaced freshman defend
er Allison Pabon.
This substitution was another fu
lile attempt to spark Stanford's dor
mant ollen.se by adding an extra at
tacking player. Switching to a 4-3-3
formation instead of their custom
ary 4-4-2 formation, the Cardinal
attempted to overload the Hear de
fense in hopes of creating more
dangerous opportunities.
I nfbrtunately, the substitution
had the reverse ellect, leaving the
('.ardinal vulnerable to the counter
attack. Cal took advantage in the
7()th minute when forward Kyla
Salx) knifed through the Stanford
defense and scored an unassisted
goal from 20 yards out to give die
bears their second goal.

"We need to work on taking bet

latelv we have had pr<>blcms finding
the back of the net," said sopho
more midfielder Becky Myers.
Even though they registered
nine shots on goal for the game
compared to ( al's 14. the C .ardinal
oflcnse rareh looked threatening
because most ol those strikes came
from long range. (Goalkeeper Za
bala, Coal's all-time shutout leader,
was able ton< >tch hereiglith shutout
of the year in relatively easy fashion.
"We just lac ked that spark today.

On offense, we never really looked
dangerous, and on defense we
never really got stuck into our tack
les or battled their pressure," Smo
lak said.
Although disappointed and Irns
irated bv the loss, Stanford needs to
Ibrget the game and figure out how
to ignite its anemic offense in ordei
to compete with its remaining Pac
10 opponents. With six conference
games remaining, including anoth
er difficult road trip to face I CIA
and I 'SCI, the Cardinal needs to fin
is)) strong in order to safely cjualih
lor the NC1AA tournament.
After a strong non-conlerence
season (7-2-1), which included six
top-25 opponents, the Cardinal
should get into the tournament il ii
can place in the top three in the con
ference. But, to do so, Stanford will
need to win many, if not all, of the
remaining six games.
"We need to learn from today
but we can not dwell on it. We havetc:
play hard for the rest ol the Pac-1()>
localise we need to win these nexi
lew games in <>rder to get back on I lie
light track. Luckily, we will be able u
play in front of our home fans, whit li
should help," l^aPierre said.
