### ALEX BENJAMIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sometimes facing a team that
has only won two games iliis sea
son can be much tougher than ii
appears. Case in point: the Stan
lord men's soccer team's (1 1-1-1)
victory over California (2-9-1) in a
hard-fought, three-goal slnitout-
Sundav at New Maloney Field.
With the win, the Cardinal
moves up to No. 2 in the NCAA Di
vision 1 men's media rankings and
N0.7 according to the National
Soccer Coaches Association of
America (NSCAA).
Alter the first half, with the
score tied at 0-0, ii appeared as if
the (Cardinal could not gel any mo
mentum going on the offensive
side of the ball. In 45 minutes the
team only managed to get off four
shots â€” substantially lower then its
season average.
However, after the second half
started, ii did not take long for
Stanford to put I lie game away
with one goal. At the 55-minute
mark, junior defender Aaron Bid

die knocked a ball up to sopho
more forward Roger Levesque,
who hammered home a brilliant
shot from the top of the box, mak
ing the score 1-0.
With that one play, the Cardi
nal seized control. At 75:58, senior
Sean Sylvis played a ball up to se
nior Luke Rust, who beat his de
lender and scored his first goal of
the game. Seven minutes later,
sophomore Abe Ceiger played a
beautiful ball over the top of the
defense where Rust knocked in a
great volley for his second goal of
the game and eighth of the year.
Despite its slow start, Stanford
was back on target with eight shots
in the second half and a dominat
ing style of play. Overall, head
coach Bobby Clark was pleased
with the performance.
"The only thing that was
wrong in the first hall was that we
gave them too much time," Clark
said. "But we had to be patient.
I lie second half we just stepped
up the pressure. Whenever they
got the ball we went after them
very hard, which is something I

thought the boys did a magnifi
cent job of. Overall, it was a good
performance."
At the back of the field senior
goalkeeper Adam Zapala was as
solid as ever gelling his 11th
shutout in 13 games, the best
shutout percentage in the nation.
By only allowing three goals on the
season, his goals against average
has dropped to an astounding .24,
placing him second among the na

tion's Division I goalkeepers.
"It was a great team win, but
you can't forget about Adam Za
pala," Clark said. "He came up
with some great saves at critical
times in the game. If Cal had got
ten a goal then they would have re
ally stepped up a level, so full
marks to Adam."
