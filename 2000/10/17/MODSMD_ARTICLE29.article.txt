## 
### ALEX BENJAMIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sometimes facing a team that
has only won two games iliis sea
son can be much tougher than ii
appears. Case in point: the Stan
lord men's soccer team's (1 1-1-1)
victory over California (2-9-1) in a
hard-fought, three-goal slnitout-
Sundav at New Maloney Field.
With the win, the Cardinal
moves up to No. 2 in the NCAA Di
vision 1 men's media rankings and
N0.7 according to the National
Soccer Coaches Association of
America (NSCAA).
Alter the first half, with the
score tied at 0-0, ii appeared as if
the (Cardinal could not gel any mo
mentum going on the offensive
side of the ball. In 45 minutes the
team only managed to get off four
shots — substantially lower then its
season average.
However, after the second half
started, ii did not take long for
Stanford to put I lie game away
with one goal. At the 55-minute
mark, junior defender Aaron Bid

die knocked a ball up to sopho
more forward Roger Levesque,
who hammered home a brilliant
shot from the top of the box, mak
ing the score 1-0.
With that one play, the Cardi
nal seized control. At 75:58, senior
Sean Sylvis played a ball up to se
nior Luke Rust, who beat his de
lender and scored his first goal of
the game. Seven minutes later,
sophomore Abe Ceiger played a
beautiful ball over the top of the
defense where Rust knocked in a
great volley for his second goal of
the game and eighth of the year.
Despite its slow start, Stanford
was back on target with eight shots
in the second half and a dominat
ing style of play. Overall, head
coach Bobby Clark was pleased
with the performance.
"The only thing that was
wrong in the first hall was that we
gave them too much time," Clark
said. "But we had to be patient.
I lie second half we just stepped
up the pressure. Whenever they
got the ball we went after them
very hard, which is something I

thought the boys did a magnifi
cent job of. Overall, it was a good
performance."
At the back of the field senior
goalkeeper Adam Zapala was as
solid as ever gelling his 11th
shutout in 13 games, the best
shutout percentage in the nation.
By only allowing three goals on the
season, his goals against average
has dropped to an astounding .24,
placing him second among the na

tion's Division I goalkeepers.
"It was a great team win, but
you can't forget about Adam Za
pala," Clark said. "He came up
with some great saves at critical
times in the game. If Cal had got
ten a goal then they would have re
ally stepped up a level, so full
marks to Adam."

met up with Santa Clara looking
tor some redemption after last
year's quadruple-overtime loss.
This year Stanford walked away
with a 2-0 victory.
Yet n was the same story that al
most got the Cardinal into trouble
on Sunday. It was not until the
27th minute of play that Stanford
rook its lii si shot oft he game — but
ii would not lake much longer lor
the (Cardinal to garner the lead. In
the .33rd minute of play senior
Sroti Leber hit a cross to Levesque
who headed the ball to the lower

corner of the goal pasi Santa (llara
goaltender Rusty Johnson.
My the 53rd minute Stanford
put away its second goal of the
game when senior Malt Moses
played a corner into Middle. ()n
the ensuing pass Middle connected
with senior Ryan Nelson, who
struck a low, hard shot into the
back of the net to put the ('ardinal
on top, 2-0.
With the win, Stanford record
ed its 10th win of the season. Nev
ertheless, the team was still not im
pressed with its performance.
"As far as the game against
Santa Clara goes, we were sloppy,
and 1 felt there was just an overall
lack of energy," Rust said. "It was a
game we should have been more

excited lor, and we tame out on
our heels. 1 .uckily, I hanks lo a cou
ple of saves from |Zapala] we were
si ill able lo get ilie desired result.''
Sophomore fodd Dunivani
was also disappointed with how
the team performed.
"The game against Santa (llara
was probably our worst perfor
mance of the year," Dunivant said.
"But we still won 2-0 so that really
savs something."
