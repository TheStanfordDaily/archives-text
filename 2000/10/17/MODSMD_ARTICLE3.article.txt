### GREG BRAZEAL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With only two weeks remaining
before Santa Clara County decides
whether to approve Stanford's 10-
year development plan, a group of
students assembled yesterday in
White Plaza for an open discussion
of development issues, including
access to the Foothills, adequate
housing and open space protec
tion.
Sophomore Tarek Ghani said
that students had not been consult
ed regarding the new Dish regula
tions.
"We're asking the administra
tion to talk," Ghani said. "We're
asking the administration to re
spond to criticisms."

Ghani, a representative of the
Green Party at Stanford, opened
the forum with a story about three
friends who went biking on the
paved "recreational route" in the
Foothills last Friday night, after the
recently imposed 7 p.m. curfew.
Finding themselves in the lights
of a police car, the friends hiked off
the paved path. The police car fol
lowed them off the path. They
eventually escaped, only to be fol
lowed off the path again by a truck.
The gathering lasted less than
an hour and attracted about 30 on
lookers, but senior Jacob Klein
said that many more students have
demonstrated their concern over
the Foothills restrictions, includ-

ing the curfew and the closing of do/ens
of trails.
Klein described <i protest last Wednes
day when, In his estimate, more ilian 200
students scaled a fence and hiked to the
Dish at midnight in defiance of the curlew.
"There was a spirit there that I haven't
really seen before anions Stanford stu
dents," he salt 1. "Stanford students are not
apathetic about this issue."
The main objective of vesterdav s
forum, according to a statement re
leased b\ the Stanford < )j»cii Space Al
liance, was to encourage students to .it
tend the Santa (il.ua Countv Planning
Commission's public hearing tomor

Council (chambers.
Planning Commissioner 1 err\
Trumball, who said he attended the dis
cussion to hear what Stanford students
thought about the I niversii\ s develop
ment plan, emphasi/cd that permanent
open space dedication is siill a ver\ real
possibility
"We have a count) supervisor who's
the first one since I've lived here who has
wanted Stanford to follow the law," he
said. "I think there's lots of room for
change, but I don't think there's much
room lor slowing down the process be

cause Supervisor Simitian leaves office
Dec. I."
Also in attendance at the lorum were
representatives ol area conservation
groups, such .is the Stanford ()pen Space
Alliance s Peter Drekmeier, who called
upon the I niversilv to IbrmalK link its fu
ture academic development to housing
devel* jpmeiit.
Drekmeier plaved down conflicts be
tween the various interest groups who
have questioned Stanford's development
plan.
"Stanford doesn't like to see these kind
of alliances," Drekmeier said. "They've
tried to pit the dog-owners against con
servationists; they've tried to pit the
goiters versus the housing advocates;
the\ ve tried to pit the school district ver
sus the environmentalists."
Near the end ol the dis< ussion, (>hani
challenged students to take action, even il
it meant sitting through the lour-hour
heai ing Wednesday.
"There are concerns that people on
this campus, when tliev get behind an
issue, tliev like to get behind .1 drum c ir
cle, tlie\ like to get behind .1 parly," he
s.iid. "Mavbe \ou should understand that
there are other political processes that you
have to gel behind."

Yesterday in White Plaza, the Stanford Open Space Alliance organized a protest and passed around
a petition against Stanford's new Dish regulations. One of the Alliance's supporters dressed up as a
tree and brought his dog to illustrate Stanford's policies towards the Foothills.
