# Water polo shoots for Bruins, barely misses

### ELIZABETH MIIN BECKY BLANCHARD 
Stanford men's water polo head coach Dante
Dettanianti sounds tense when he speaks about
his team's chances to make it into the four-team
p<K)l that will compete for the national title.
Usually a water polo powerhouse, the Cardi
nal has posted a dismal 6-5 record after losing
most of last season's offensive firepower to grad
uation. To make it to post-season play, Detta
nianti knew th.it his squad would have to win the
rest of its matches to have a shot at advancing out
of the mighty Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion.
As if the pressure of winning the remainder of
its conference games wasn't enough, the Cardi
nal's schedule last weekend couldn't have been
tougher. Upending top-ranked, league-rival
I ( L\ proved to be too formidable a task, even
fora hardworking Stanford squad that appears

to have worked out the offensive kinks that had
undone the first half of its season.
In a furiously fought match against the Bru
ins, the sixth-ranked (Cardinal fell 8-7 in a double
overtime thriller but saw six different players
score and hinted at the potential this Stanford
squad has when its oflense clicks.
This weekend's match proved that Stanford's
leading scorers, sophomores Brian Darrow and
Peter I ludnut. were not the only ones capable of
putting the ball in the back of the net. A handful
of other players, including junior Todd Snider,
senior Peter Osborn, sophomore Jeff Nesmith
and junior Pasi Dutton, were able to raise the
score as well, an encouraging sign for the rest of
Stanford's season.
The Bruins (10-2) came to the Farm after tal
lying an 11-5 win against No. 4 Cal. On Sunday
however, UCLA was not able to turn in such a
controlling performance against Stanford.
Fhe Cardinal (6-6) jumped to an early lead,

with Snider and Huclnut combining for three
early goals and maintained the three-point lead
up through the second period.
The Bruins rallied back, adding two goals and
cutting the Cardinal lead to 4-3 at halftime. In the
second half, it appeared as if the Cardinal would
cruise to a 7-5 victory, but UCLA-star Adam
Wright rallied the Bruins back into the game.
Wright scored two goals in the fourth period —
his 24th and 25th goals of the season — to give
UCLA a c hance to extend its six-game winning
streak.
Where Cal had fallen easily to UCI A's domi
nant play the previous day, Stanford refused to
do the same, lighting gallantly in overtime. Un
fortunately, the Cardinal's efforts were thwarted
by UCLA's Sean Kern, a 2000 Olympian, who
scored at 1 minute, 35 seconds in the first over
time to bring the score to 8-7.
Because it was not a sudden
death situation, Stanford had the
rest of the first period and the sec -
ond overtime period to answer
Kern's goal. Nesmith's last-minute
attempt to tie the game on an extra
man situation tailed thanks to
I ( lAs defensive pressure.
Stanford's inability to capitalize
on the last power play was the de
ciding lac tor in its defeat, but did
not necessarily represent how it had
played throughout the majority ol
the game. In t lie previc>us t wc>extra
man situations, the Cardinal was
able to exploit its numeric al advan
tage and convert it into two goals.
Similarly, the Stanford defense
stood strong throughout regulation
play, but faltered only in the end.
I'ClA's kern was able to put the
ball past goalie Nic k kilts thanks toa
minor error by the Cardinal de
fense— an error that unfortunately
cost it the game.
Kilts, a sophomore, finished the
game with a career-high lb saves
this season, but was unable to stop
the forehand shot by Kern without
the shielded of Stanford's defense.
Despite the errors that led to the
team's loss, Dcttamanti was pleased
by his team's performance.
"This is the Ixst game we've
played all year. We pic ked up our
shooting on offense and it's the l>csi
we've shot this season,' Dcttamanti
said. "We made three goals off of
the fii.it three shots and led the

whole game."
Kven without 2000 Olympian
Tonv A/cvccfo, who will be redshirt
ing his freshman year, the Stanford
oflense was able to pull together and
effectively score. Contributions
from the whole teannvere crucial to
Stanford's outstanding perfor
mance, despite the loss.
"We just have todoa better job of
finishing the game and protecting
the lead so we can take away the vic -
tory," Dc ttamanti said.
Stanford will take all that that it
learned against the Bruins into the
NorC lal Tournament t his weekend.
The field boasts 10 of the top2o
teams in the nation, including
U( I.A. Stanford will look to use not
only its skill and physical prepara
tion, but also newly found confi
dence and a strong mental attitude
to contend for the title.
"I feel gcKwl that we were able to
play this well against the numlxr
one team in the country," Dctta
manti said. "We're capable of play
ing the Inst even without lonv.
We'll Ix- able to build on this game
and keep improving, playing good
water pc >1< > for the rest < »112 the scasc>n."
Despite strong play against
I'C.LA, the Cardinal's record has
dropped to (>-(">, and the rest of the
season will still Ik- a chase-from-lie
hincl fora national berth. I lowever.
if this weekend was a sign of things
to come, the C '.ardinal's loss may im
prove its c hanc es for the NCAA title
in another way — it may Ix- the one
team from the MPSF that can upset
the Bruins in the conference tour
nament and claim the league's sole
automatic national berth.

last season, has consistently been a key scorer for the Cardinal this season.
