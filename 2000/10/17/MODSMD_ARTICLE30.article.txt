Stanford men's water polo head coach Dante
Dettanianti sounds tense when he speaks about
his team's chances to make it into the four-team
p<K)l that will compete for the national title.
Usually a water polo powerhouse, the Cardi
nal has posted a dismal 6-5 record after losing
most of last season's offensive firepower to grad
uation. To make it to post-season play, Detta
nianti knew th.it his squad would have to win the
rest of its matches to have a shot at advancing out
of the mighty Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion.
As if the pressure of winning the remainder of
its conference games wasn't enough, the Cardi
nal's schedule last weekend couldn't have been
tougher. Upending top-ranked, league-rival
I ( L\ proved to be too formidable a task, even
fora hardworking Stanford squad that appears

to have worked out the offensive kinks that had
undone the first half of its season.
In a furiously fought match against the Bru
ins, the sixth-ranked (Cardinal fell 8-7 in a double
overtime thriller but saw six different players
score and hinted at the potential this Stanford
squad has when its oflense clicks.
This weekend's match proved that Stanford's
leading scorers, sophomores Brian Darrow and
Peter I ludnut. were not the only ones capable of
putting the ball in the back of the net. A handful
of other players, including junior Todd Snider,
senior Peter Osborn, sophomore Jeff Nesmith
and junior Pasi Dutton, were able to raise the
score as well, an encouraging sign for the rest of
Stanford's season.
The Bruins (10-2) came to the Farm after tal
lying an 11-5 win against No. 4 Cal. On Sunday
however, UCLA was not able to turn in such a
controlling performance against Stanford.
Fhe Cardinal (6-6) jumped to an early lead,

with Snider and Huclnut combining for three
early goals and maintained the three-point lead
up through the second period.
The Bruins rallied back, adding two goals and
cutting the Cardinal lead to 4-3 at halftime. In the
second half, it appeared as if the Cardinal would
cruise to a 7-5 victory, but UCLA-star Adam
Wright rallied the Bruins back into the game.
Wright scored two goals in the fourth period —
his 24th and 25th goals of the season — to give
UCLA a c hance to extend its six-game winning
streak.
Where Cal had fallen easily to UCI A's domi
nant play the previous day, Stanford refused to
do the same, lighting gallantly in overtime. Un
fortunately, the Cardinal's efforts were thwarted
by UCLA's Sean Kern, a 2000 Olympian, who
scored at 1 minute, 35 seconds in the first over
time to bring the score to 8-7.
