### AARON LEVINE 
The under-card in the Fresno Lexus Classic last
weekend might have read "Capability vs. Perfor
mance: Round Three."
Fortunately for the Stanford men's golf team, per
formance finally prevailed in TKO fashion.
Three players finished in the top 10 at the Fort
Washington Golf Course, including junior Philip
Rowe, who won the individual title and led the Car
dinal to its first tournament victory of the season.
Rowe posted rounds of 69-71-68 (-8) to win his
first collegiate event, bettering Toledo's Kevin ko
rnowa (-5) and Stanford teammate Jiin Seki. Seki, a
sophomore, fired 69-72-71 (-4) to finish in third
place.
Stanford's total store of 851 (-13) outdid second
place San Diego State (-4) by nine strokes.
More importantly, 13 of the 18 teams in the tour
nament had been ranked higher than Stanford, in
cluding San Diego State, which was ranked ninth,
and Nevada (+18). which was ranked 19th last week
by the national Sagarin rating system.
According to first-year head coach Jeff Mitchell,
the win could not have come at a better time for the
Cardinal, which was coming off of disappointing
ninth- and 10th place finishes in its first two tourna
ments of the season.
"This win was really important to us, since we

managed to beat a very strong field," Mitchell said.
"Everybody hung in there and stayed patient, and
the win shows us that we belong in that area ol [top
caliber teams]."
That patience could be seen in senior Jimmy Lee.
who fought his way back to shoot an even-par 72 after
bogeying three of his first four holes in the final
round. Lee finished in seventh place with rounds of
71-71-72 (-2).
Senior Eric I)ahlberg joined in the (Cardinal surge
shooting 72-72-74 ( +2) to lie for 1 (ith place, while se
nior Alex Aragon finished in a lie for 35th, firing
rounds of 78-71-74 ( + 7).
Rowe, who was in third place after two rounds,
took charge early in the final round, with birdies on
the first and third holes. After bogeying the par-five
ninth hole, the native of Cornwall, England, made
crucial birdies on the 12th, 15th and 17th holes to
clinch the individual title.
"I was pleased to have finally won [a tourna
ment]," said Rowe. whose best finish previously had
been a seventh-place tie at the Taylor Made/
Waikaloa Intercollegiate in February. "It will be nice
to tee it up next time, having the confidence of know
ing that I can win."
This tournament victory and fresh confidence
might just be what every member ol the team will
need heading into future tourna
ments this veal.
I lie win was not onl\ the ( ar
dinal's lirst in almost a vear — it
captured I lie Nelson Invitational
in October HKM) — but it also
came when the line between capa
bilit\ and at tual perfbrtnance was
growing thicker.
I here wasn't necessarih a
sense ol urgency," Seki said, "but

we still hadn't gotten into the
swing ol things yet. I his time
there was a different, more re
laxed feeling out there. [This tour
nament win | will definitely help
our psyche."
I lie difference last weekend
could be seen in the contributions
of multiple players, rather than
having onl\ a couple of individu
als lead the squad.
"We all managed to perform
well this time." said Rowe, who has
been the (lardinal's top performer
in all three tournaments this year.
"Hopefully this will lead to

future success."
The Cardinal will have a
chance to test its new-found confi
dence in two weeks, when it will
again host The Nelson Invitation
al Oct. 27 to-29 at the Stanford
Golf Course.
Mitchell attests that the field will
be even stronger, hut that the team
should he up for the challenge.
"It's really early in the season,
but we're all starting to get used to
each other, and things are starting
to ge! and come together for us,"
Mitchell said.
