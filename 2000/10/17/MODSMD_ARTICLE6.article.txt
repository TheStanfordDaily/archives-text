# Premier Cardinal Flex Plan offers increased meal options
## 
### JIMMY WU 
I lave you ever wondered where
those one or two leftover meal cred
its disappear to at the end of each
week? Did you ever ask why tradi
tion, il meal plans do not allow you to
swipe your card more than once
dining one meal to help a friend
who forgot her card?
I his fall, these questions have
been answered with the launching
of the new Premiere Cardinal Flex
meal plan.
According to Shirley Everett, di
rector of I Iniversity Dining Services,
if a student chooses to purchase the
Premiere Cardinal Flex meal plan,
he will receive options that the tradi
tion,il 19-, 14- and 12-plus-points
meal plans do not offer.
flu* most noticeable difference is
that Premiere Cardinal Flex meal
plan holders "have a set number of
meals and points per quarter that
carry over from week to week, to be
used any time during the quarter,"

Kverett said.
Kxtra meals left over at the end of
the week carryover to the next week
under the Flex plan, instead of dis
appearing. The plan also permits
students to swipe their card as many
times as they wish during each meal,
allowingstudents to easily treat their
guests to University Dining.
Any student who has the option
of purchasing a traditional meal
plan, undergraduates liv ing in Mir
rielees, graduate students and com
muters all have the opportunity to
utilize this new plan. In order to
maintain flexibility, the plan allows
students to purchase their meals at
any University Dining Services resi
dence hall facility.
I he plan also allows students to
exchange their meals I or $2.75
worth of a la carte serv ices at Man
/anita Dining Hall, Stern Cyber
Cafe and Lakeside I .ate Nile service
at Lagunita. Meals carry over each
week, but not each quarter. Fifty a la
carte points can fx' carried over to

the next quarter.
Dining Services formulated the
plan as a result of student feedback.
"Dining Services posted an on
line survey, and it concluded that
several students wanted an addi
tional meal plan option that would
allow more flexibility," Everett said.
"In response. Dining Sen ices creat
ed the Premiere Cardinal Flex meal
plan with input from students and
the ASSU.
"[The plan] is particularly useful
for students involved in travel for
sports, late class schedules, jobs off
campus and for students who wish
to invite family or friends to dine
with them," she added.
Several students have voiced fa
vorable opinions of the new plan.
"The flex plan makes more
sense in general.... I have the
meals discounted when I eat them,
instead of at the end of the week,"
sophomore Ana Lonihera said. "It
bothered me that last year I would
alwavs have one or two meals left

over at the end of every week, and 1
was on the 14-meal plan."
" Hie new plan allows really nice
flexibility," freshman Meredith lx.r
said. "For example, my roommate
lost her II) cart! and used up my
guest meals in one day, but now,
with the new plan, she can lose her
card a number of times and it
wouldn't matter."

The plan also has its critics.
"1 believe [the plan] is allowing
you to have more flexibility by sacri
ficing your points," said sophomore
Travis Tan. "[The plan] isn't as
much value (as the 12-plus-points
plan], unless you eat less than 6
meals per week or bring in many
guests."
Kvcrett hopes "to utilize this year

to assess the new meal plan, and
make necessary changes based on
feedback from students and Dining
Services staff.''
The cost of the plan is about
$4,050, $20 more than the tradi
tional 19- or 12-plus-points meal
plan for the entire year. The plan
offers 390 meals and 300 points per
year.
