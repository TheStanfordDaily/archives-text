Meet InffuentliM Movement
Rosalyn Baxandall and Unda Gordon, editors
Today's women take their expanded opportunities so much for granted that
they often forget to credit the women's liberation movement of the 1960s
and 70s for these monumental gains in the schools, the playing fields,
the doctors' offices, the media, the law and the workplace.
Distinguished scholars and active participants in the movement, Linda Gordon
and Rosalyn Baxandall have collected and analyzed a colorful array of
documents - songs, leaflets, cartoons, position papers -that illustrate the
range of people, places, organizations and ideas that made up the movement.
Dear Sisters chronicles historical change in such broad areas as health,
work and family, and captures the subtle humor, unceasing passion and
racial diversity that defined the women's liberation movement.
