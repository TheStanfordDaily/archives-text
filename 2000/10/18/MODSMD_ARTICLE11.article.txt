On October 18, 1973, The Daily report
ed on a Cowell heath care issue.
"Stanford women making appoint
ments with the Cowell Health ('.enter gy
necologist are in tor a long wait and a dis
couraging surprise. The popular Dr. Sue
Ellen Massey left her post as part-time gy
necologist Monday, and the health services
director, Dr. James McClenahan, has not
found a replacement. . . .
"Head Receptionist Esther Lang agrees.
There is a need fora more than part-time
gynecologist. If there were a full-time doc
tor, her schedule could be 112 illed.
"As one frustrated patient put it, 'You
can't see a gynecologist just because you'd
feel more comfortable. And when you do
finally see her, you feel guilty for taking up
her time."
Bottom line: At least there are still the 10 free
condoms offer every quarter to prevent unnec
essary visits to the gynecologist.
