first network of widely separated
computers — at first, just four of
them — was created by the Depart

research. It was called the
ARPANET, and it was created —

In yesterday's paper, The Daily
misidentified the sponsor of the speech by
bell hooks. The talk was sponsored by the
Women's Center.
In the Sept. 28 issue of The Daily, the
article "Plugged-In: Bridging the digital di

Plugged-In employees, Florencia Zuberti
and Bobby Baird. The Innovation editors
sincerely apologize to both Ms. Zuberti and
Mr. Baird.
