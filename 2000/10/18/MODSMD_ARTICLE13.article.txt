SHARM EL-SI I Kl K, Egypt
(AP) — Ending an emergency
summit fraught with anger and
mistrust, Israeli and Palestinian
leaders agreed yesterday to pub
licly urge an end to a hurst of
hloody conflict and to consult
within two weeks on restarting the
ravaged Mideast peace process.
In the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, new violence dared even as
marathon negotiations in this Red
Sea resort reached a finale. I hat
cast doubt on whether a com erted
effort by Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Palestinian lead
er Yasser Arafat could halt chaotic
street clashes between Israeli
troops and Palestinian stone
throwers .iiul gunmen that raged
tina 20th day.
Israeli sccurit\ forces "will be
meticulous in their ellorts to end
the violence and prevent further
loss ol life." Barak said in Jerusalem,
responding to a provision in the
agreement requiring each of the
leaders to make a public statement
denouncing the violence.
In a statement issued late 1 ues
day, the Palestinian leadership
said, "Our people will not initiate
violence, but our people were the
victims of this violence."
Earlier yesterday, as he
returned to Gaza, Arafat told
reporters, "We expect that the
implementation will be exact 1\ as
we agreed upon."
Barak s.iid the agreement con
tained "clear understandings" on
ways to calm tensions. "II the
Palestinian side sticks to it and we
do our part, and there really is a

calming down, then this is a sig
nificant change."
Soon after the deal was
announced, the militant Islamic
group I lamas s.iid it w.is not bound
by it. And in the latest wave of vio
lence, two Palestinians were killed
yesterda\ in fierce gunbattles,
pushing the death toll above 100,
neatly .ill ol them Palestinians. An
Israeli policeman was critically
wounded in a Jerusalem firelight.
Reading a care fit Ih worded
statement .it the conclusion of 28
hours of talks interrupted onl\ In
a lour-hour rest period, President
Clinton said. "We have made
important commitments here
today against a backdrop of
tragedy and crisis. Repairing the
damage will take time and great
effort bv all ol us."
I he talks were complex ones,
involving seven parties—lsrael
and the Palestinians, the I nited
States, the I'nited Nations, Egypt,
|ordan and the European I nioti.
Clinton held more than 20 meet
ings. the White I louse said.
I nderscoring the depths of the
bitterness lingering between tin
panics, the agreements that
emerged from the summit were
described as "understandings."
with no formal signing taking place.
The "understandings" includ
ed taking some practical steps to
cool tensions, such as lifting
Israel's hlockaclc ol the West Bank
and (iaza, reopening the (laza air
port and instituting measures to
separate the two sides at points of
friction. No spec itic deadlines
were disclosed, however.

Additionally, within two weeks
the two sides were to meet with
American mediators to explore
the possibility of resuming talks.
Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said.
I he summit's host, Egyptian
President Ilosni Mubarak, said the
summit's outcome is "not equal to
what our peoples aspire to, but
the\ could be the basis lor continu
ing our ellorts to achieve peace."
Ihe Palestinian delegation
pointedly refused to give an
enthusiastic endorsement. Ibex
went dirccth from the conference
center to the airport without mak
ing any statements. Before the
(Ic.il w.is announced, Arafat aide
Nabil Shaath said the Pale stinians
"are not happy, but we want to
protect the lives ol our people.
Barak said Israel achieved its
main objectives at the summit.
"Let me emphasize that the
real test of all the understandings
and agreements is iinpinnenta
tion," he said. "We will.isk to stop
the violence in the spirit of under
standings and concessions deter
mined here and.it Camp David."
Back in the West Bank, |ibril
Rajoub, the Palestinian securitx
chief there, said the onus Ini
restoring calm is on the Israelis.
"It's tlie\ who created lliis cri
sis, the\ are the ones who used
acts of killing and terrorism
against out people," Rajoub said.
"What is needed now is foi
them to take all the necessary
measures to stop this violence."
Saving he feared tensions ina\
rcignitc, I N. Sccretan General

koli Annan ( ailed on both sides to
"weigh their words carefully"
while steps are taken to restore
calm. "Knding the violence is a
real achievement. But language
can he violent too," Annan said.
Clinton's appeal lor the two
sides to "move bevond blame"
and resume peace negotiations

may prove difficult to achieve.
Both Israel and the Palestinians
have balked at promising outright
to abide by a cease-lire because
each believes that in doing so,
they accept too large a share of
responsibility for the carnage.
Israel says it has taken only the
measures necessan to protect its

soldiers and citizens, with the use
of heavy weaponry like tanks and
helicopter gunships falling into
that category. Palestinians furious
ly dismissed that, saying the
Israelis had blasted away with fire
power disproportionate to the
threat posed by stone-throwing
crowds and paramilitary gunmen.
