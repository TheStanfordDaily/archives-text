SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -
The U.S. Navy is being offered an
uninhabited Panamanian island for
$35 million to replace a Puerto Rican
bombing range where ongoing
protests have severely limited the
Navy's room for maneuver.
San |ose island is located 55 miles
south of Panama City. The asking
price is a bargain compared to the $90
million the government may have to
spend to keep the island ol Vieques
under a White I louse deal, s.iid Kuril
Danciu, a former mayor of Boca
Raton, Ma., who is representing the
island's American and Panamanian
owners.
"I'm presenting an island that I
think is a great alternative, a very viable
alternative to Vieques." Danciu said.
I'he U.S. military had a small out
post on the l2,()()0-acre island during

World \\ ar II and used it .is a bombing
range and test site for < heinical
weapons, he said. I he island lias gone
unsold for decades because it is
believed to be contaminated.
President Clinton's adviser on Puer
to Rico, |effre\ Farrow, said the White
House had passed the offer on to the
Navy.
Although there was no immediate
comment from the Navy, the location
ol San |ose — on the Pacific side of the
Panama Canal — appeared a disad
vantage fora facility meant to serve the
Atlantic Meet.
In addition, it offers no equivalent
to the huge Roosevelt Roads Naval Sta
tion. which administers Vieques exer
cises from a lew miles awav on Puerto
Rico's mainland.
1 he Navy has tailed Vieques irre
placeable, but l arrow said it was look

ing at substitutes because of Clinton's
pledge that the military would leave l>\
May 2003 il residents request the
departure in a referendum. I hat vote
could occ in as early as next year.
"The Navv is exploring what the
options are. 112 arrow said. "I he presi
dent is committed, the Nav\ is commit
ted and the Congress is committed to
the Naw leaving after this period if the
people vote loi it."
Danciu said San |ose lias deep
anchorage, a harbor, a ."i.OOO-loot grass
airstrip and sanely beaches that were
used lor the kind of amphibious land
ings du- military practice.-, on Vieques,
which is part of Puerto Rico
I he Navy bought two-thirds of
Vieques in the 19405. I he 9,400 c ivil
ian residents of the island complain
that the exercises have harmed their
economy, health and environment.

military exercise. The exercise is the first on Vieques since the April 19,1999, bombing accident which took the life of a civilian
