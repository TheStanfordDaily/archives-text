ST. LOUIS (AD â€” Ralph Nader sued
I lie* commission organizing the presiden
tial debates yesterday, aiming to dismantle
the system that kept him out of the 2000
televised debates.
I lis lawsuit, tiled in Boston and claiming
his rights were violated by his exclusion from
tin- first debate there, came as Nader
protested the commission's refusal to let him
join Al (lore and George W. Bush for the
third and final confrontation in St. Louis.
Nader, the Green Party candidate for
president, said excluding him again would
put the bipartisan commission "in hot
water again."

Ile was denied across to the ()ct. 3 event
in Boston even though he had been given
a ticket by a local college student.
It was that event that prompted the law
suit in I S. District Court in Boston against
the Commission on Presidential Debates,
the commission's two co-chairmen, a com
mission "security consultant" and a State
Police sergeant.
Nader called the lawsuit the first step in
dismantling the commission.
"By the time I'm finished with the
debate commission, its ranking in political
opinion polls will be below the ranking of
used car dealers," Nader said.
