## The 						Stanford Daily Corporate focus constrained Career Fair

CORPORATE CU LTU RE CON
SI \IES our campus. ()n ()ct. 10, Stan
ford's Career Development Center
held Career Fair 2000 in White Plaza.
Rather than serving as a lorum for students to
explore a wide variety of industries, jobs and
internships, however, this event amounted to lit
tle more than a chance for business and high
tech firms to shop for potential hires.
From 1 1 a.m. to 4 p.m., anxious students
dressed in slacks and polos or blouses raced
from booth to booth, jockeying lor a position
among their peers. Students spent a minute or
two at each booth, listening to representatives
recite the company line and dropping a
resume before moving on.
Is this really the way Stanford wants to help
its students navigate their entry into the "real
world," especially in light of President Hen-

nessv's stated commitment to the humanities
and the ideal of knowledge for its own sake?
Part of the frenzy last Tuesday, as well as the
nature of career services at Stanford, can be
atti ibuted lo fundamental characteristics of our
university. Not only is Stanford situated in the
heart of Silicon Valley and near the financial
center of San Francisco, but its reputation for
academic excellence in business majors and the
hard sciences makes its students desirable as
new hires lor finance and engineering linns.
In addition, Stanford admits and sustains a
highlv motivated, energetic, future-oriented
and "go-getter" student body. While these
traits usually produce a flourish of positive
campus activity, in the wrong circumstances
many Stanford students can become panicky
and. as a result, competitive.
As students are lacing the onslaught of cor

porate recruiting, with its fixed deadlines and
finite employment openings, these feelings of
panic tend to generate a vicious cycle of anxi
ety that causes students to fret prematurely
about their post-graduate prospects. In short,
many students dive into the investment bank
ing, consulting and technology applicant pool
because it is those types of companies that are
most visible on campus. Indeed, they seem like
the only available options.
While these many factors explain the on
campus dominance of a relatively small sector
of the job market, they by no means excuse it.
I he CI)C has an obligation to present the full
range of post-graduate options to students. In
this capacity, the Public Service (larecr Fair and
the extensive materials and services available in
the ('.IK! office make positive contributions. Yet
the former conies too late in the year to calm

"senioritis" and the latter remains unknown to
many students. Not enough is clone to counter
balance the overwhelming corporate presence.
Besides some token public service organiza
tions and a select number of government agen
cies such as the (lIA and Peace Corps, the c irc us
in White Plaza failed to represent the broad and
nuanc ed spectrum of post-graduation options.
What about not-lor-prolits or social / politi
cal advocacy groups? What about the media or
(lie publishing industry? What about think
tanks or other research institutions? What
about politics or the millions of government
jobs out there? What about teaching or enter
ing graduade school or pursuing a fellowship?
Fhe "real world" is 112 ull of opportunities and
possibilities and the Career Development Cen
ter needs to make that blatantly clear to Stan
lord students.
