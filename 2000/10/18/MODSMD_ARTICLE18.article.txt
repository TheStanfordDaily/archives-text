# LOVE IN THE TIME OF COSMO
## The 						Flesh made Word 
### MICHAEL TOTH STAFF COLUMNIST 
The golden rule of the glossy-cov
ered fashion magazine is "the
thinner the model, the less likelv
it is she is smiling." Just open am
issue of CQ, Vogue, or Details and you'll
see page upon page of the same hollow
eves set above bom (hecks, the accumula
tion of such faces graduallv leaving behind
the image of a solemn army of perfumed
scented stick figures wandering the side-

walks of Chelsea,
I ribeca, Paris, San Fran
cisco, or wherever it is
that fashion models live.
I learned this and
more in the course of a
one-afternoon experi
ment during which I
compared the style and
content of two leading
barometers of contem-

porary culture, each popular among the
university set: Maxim magazine pour
homme and (Cosmopolitan maga/ine
pour lemme.
Putting aside its overt objectilication
of women and its vociferous support for
the lowest common denominator in
nearly every realm of culture, Maxim
magazine rests upon certain duly consid
ered psvchological assumptions, lor
starters: The male species, at least in its
American iorm, resides in a permanent
state of adolescence, unable to locus on
anything more than the bare minimum
lot its survival. The cover of the August
edition neatly summarizes the bound
aries of the Maxim Man's horizon as Sex,
Sports, Beer, Gadgets, Clothes and Fit
ness. Judging bv what's inside the (over
of Maxim, Stupidity, Mediocrity and
Rudeness might have been even more
appropriate headings.
(Caesar Maximus is materialistic to the
core, living simply by the received logic of
the advertising age. / wear a label, therefore
I am. His life has no art, no literature, no
religion nor even a felt need lor any. In
the (>ospel according the Maxim Man, the
Mesh has replaced the Word. Indeed, il
one did not consider it a metaphysical
reality, he might conclude that the Maxim
Man is entirely devoid of a human soul, or
just forever willing to jettison it for killer
Abs or the Perfect Orgasm. In the Maxim
world, there are no poor people, no dis
abled children, no lost causes; there art
no philosophers to ask tricky questions
nor leaders to oiler even trie kier answers.
All this has been replaced by a single Holy

Crusade: the Kternal Pursuit of 1 h\ Self.
l he response of women to the evolu
tion of the Maxim Man, il a magazine rack
lull of women's monthlies is to be believed
is. astonishingly, one- of consent, if not
open encouragement. I imagine .it some
point .1 management consultant on Fifth
Avenue realized tli.it it wasn't enough that
all these magazines are owned by the
same people, their articles needed to be
written by the same people, also.
While Maxim offers its hungry readers
snap-shot monthly installments of the
same well-proportioned Venuses, one
after an other affirming her preference
for sex over romance, enjoyment over
commitment, Cosmopolitan magazine
implores her faithful congregation to
become that very Venus: the apple in the
eye of the New Adam. While Maxim lec -
tures each male reader to place himself
proudly in the center of his own spinning
globe, Cosmo encourages its faithful to
compete for whatever attention the
Maxim Man has left for the outside
world.
"When all eyes are on you." a lengthy
Cosmo homily in this month's edition
exhorts, "do your best div;i strut across the
room and lav a big wet one on his lips."
"Say something like. ' F.xcuse inc. I'm
doing research for my masters thesis on
the evolution of courtship and copulation
in the -Ist century. I'm developing a
super-kiss theory and I'd love to see your
technique.' "
Life must be easy lor the Maxim Man.
If Maxitn urges its masses toward the
Kternal Pursuit of the Male Self. Cosmo
preaches the Kternal Pursuit of the Male.
Compared to the great upheavals of the
past, the Masculine Liberation has come
easy.
"Look at <ill the choices we have down
there," one c haracter tells another, over
looking a thumping dance floor in Whit
Stillinan's intelligent 1998 film, The Last
Days of Disco. And she's right about the
"down there. Ihe sexual revolution now
complete, responsibility for family an issue
of the far-off past, motherhood and
fatherhood equally passe, each Maxim
hoinme and his (cosmopolitan feinme can
henceforth leap alone into the brave new
world of limitless autonomy, seeking
material satisfaction from every hidden
corner of the valley of abundance, per
sonal fulfillment from every field of desire,
but discovering ever more assuredly a
despair that only grows deeper.

He is in Eternal Pursuit of his thesis.
