Former Hillel board member defends
donation request
The Daily's condemnation ol HiUel's
new policy ol requesting $180 donations
foi I ligh I folv Daws tic kets displays a lack
of understanding of the factors that led
the Stanford Hillel Board — painfully —
to reach this decision.
Among the most salient were these:
First, with services open to the public at no
charge, the Liberal Services filled Memo
rial Auditorium twice over for every ser
vice. I his means that the Hillel rabbi was
required to put on back-to-back services
— each of them three hours or more in
length. Many times, Hillel had to hire, .it
significant expense, outside rabbis to assist
with the eflort required by two services.
Second, local synagogues in the com
munity have for years urged Hillel not to
provide free services in the hope that
unaffiliated Jews would join congrega
tions. Indeed, we understand that atten
dance at synagogue services substantially
increased this year.
I hird, Stanford llilicl is not like any
other religious organization on campus. It
is neither affiliated with a local place of
worship tlicit would provide financial sup
port, as are so many of the affiliated cam
pus ministries, nor does it receive any sup
port from the University.
Unlike the religious groups that con
duct services by University chaplains,
whose salaries are paid by the University -
in Memorial Church, a magnificent facili
ty fully supported by the University, - I fil

lei is completely financially independent
of Stanford. Indeed. Stanford, for the first
lime this year, charged llillel the full cost
lor providing security lor I lillel s services!
Finally, and most importantly, while
some of our students expressed enthusi
asm for having I lillel s services be popu
lated by community members, many oth
ers expressed a desire to be with fellow
members of the Stanford family on High
Holy Days, so that they did not walk into
a large auditorium filled with people thev
didn't know or recognize.
This year, Stanford students were on
the bima at the close of Yom Kippur ser
vices: in previous years, school-aged chil
dren were the ones granted that special
privilege. Stanford Hillel's mission is to
serve Stanford students. The new policy,
while imperfect, was a concerned Board's
attempt to c reate a sense of a welcoming
and identifiable Jewish campus communi
ty for our students.

Student defends Hillel policy
I am writing in response to the Oct. 9
editorial criticizing Stanford Hillel for
charging a fee for Rosh Hashana and
Yom kippur services. ("New Hillel Policy
mandates donation for High Holidays,"
Monday, Oct. 9.)
To begin, there is a central assumption

in the editorial that Ilillel at Stanford is
unique in charging for High Holiday ser
vices. 1 hi> assumption is simply untrue.
I lillel at Stanford was, in fact, the only I lil
lel in the country ih.it offered free services
to the larger Jewish community.
Additionally, a private temple would
typically charge members a full year's
worth of dues to attend I ligh I loliday ser
vices, which are frequently in excess of
one thousand dollars, in addition to
charging for High Holiday tickets. The
cost of I lillel services this year was a frac
tion of this charge.
Furthermore, the editorial challenged
that the fee was putting a price on con
necting with one's G-d. The fee for ser
vices does not represent the price of con
necting with one's G-d, but rather the
price ol the facilities, human resources,
lighting, equipment and publicity that
were required to provide two sets of High
Holiday services this year. These services
do not happen on their own — they
require tremendous human and financial
resources to occur.
Ihe editorial then goes on to say,
"leldstein said that Ilillel will not turn
away anyone for whom the cost of services
is a concern. I here is an inconsistency
here with the beginning of the editorial
where it is intimated that this fee barred
community members from attending ser
vices. A second and more important point
is that most members of the community
can aflord to pay the small fee. This is dis
