Former Hillel board member defends
donation request
The Daily's condemnation ol HiUel's
new policy ol requesting $180 donations
foi I ligh I folv Daws tic kets displays a lack
of understanding of the factors that led
the Stanford Hillel Board — painfully —
to reach this decision.
Among the most salient were these:
First, with services open to the public at no
charge, the Liberal Services filled Memo
rial Auditorium twice over for every ser
vice. I his means that the Hillel rabbi was
required to put on back-to-back services
— each of them three hours or more in
length. Many times, Hillel had to hire, .it
significant expense, outside rabbis to assist
with the eflort required by two services.
Second, local synagogues in the com
munity have for years urged Hillel not to
provide free services in the hope that
unaffiliated Jews would join congrega
tions. Indeed, we understand that atten
dance at synagogue services substantially
increased this year.
I hird, Stanford llilicl is not like any
other religious organization on campus. It
is neither affiliated with a local place of
worship tlicit would provide financial sup
port, as are so many of the affiliated cam
pus ministries, nor does it receive any sup
port from the University.
Unlike the religious groups that con
duct services by University chaplains,
whose salaries are paid by the University -
in Memorial Church, a magnificent facili
ty fully supported by the University, - I fil

lei is completely financially independent
of Stanford. Indeed. Stanford, for the first
lime this year, charged llillel the full cost
lor providing security lor I lillel s services!
Finally, and most importantly, while
some of our students expressed enthusi
asm for having I lillel s services be popu
lated by community members, many oth
ers expressed a desire to be with fellow
members of the Stanford family on High
Holy Days, so that they did not walk into
a large auditorium filled with people thev
didn't know or recognize.
This year, Stanford students were on
the bima at the close of Yom Kippur ser
vices: in previous years, school-aged chil
dren were the ones granted that special
privilege. Stanford Hillel's mission is to
serve Stanford students. The new policy,
while imperfect, was a concerned Board's
attempt to c reate a sense of a welcoming
and identifiable Jewish campus communi

Student defends Hillel policy
I am writing in response to the Oct. 9
editorial criticizing Stanford Hillel for
charging a fee for Rosh Hashana and
Yom kippur services. ("New Hillel Policy
mandates donation for High Holidays,"
Monday, Oct. 9.)
To begin, there is a central assumption

in the editorial that Ilillel at Stanford is
unique in charging for High Holiday ser
vices. 1 hi> assumption is simply untrue.
I lillel at Stanford was, in fact, the only I lil
lel in the country ih.it offered free services
to the larger Jewish community.
Additionally, a private temple would
typically charge members a full year's
worth of dues to attend I ligh I loliday ser
vices, which are frequently in excess of
one thousand dollars, in addition to
charging for High Holiday tickets. The
cost of I lillel services this year was a frac
tion of this charge.
Furthermore, the editorial challenged
that the fee was putting a price on con
necting with one's G-d. The fee for ser
vices does not represent the price of con
necting with one's G-d, but rather the
price ol the facilities, human resources,
lighting, equipment and publicity that
were required to provide two sets of High
Holiday services this year. These services
do not happen on their own — they
require tremendous human and financial
resources to occur.
Ihe editorial then goes on to say,
"leldstein said that Ilillel will not turn
away anyone for whom the cost of services
is a concern. I here is an inconsistency
here with the beginning of the editorial
where it is intimated that this fee barred
community members from attending ser
vices. A second and more important point
is that most members of the community
can aflord to pay the small fee. This is dis
missed by the editorial as "hardly being
the point" when it is in reality just that.
Why should Hillel spend monies that
would otherwise go toward funding stu
dent programming on free services that
the community at large can allbrd? flu
simple fact is that someone must pay lor
these services. The question then
becomes, who should pay? Students, for
whom the organization was created, or a
wealthy local Jewish community that is
frequently a beneficiary of IlillcTs
services?
I he answer is clear: Local community
members that can allbrd the suggested
donation to attend High Holiday services
should pay it unbegrudgingly and, if
nothing else, consider it a long-term
investment in the Peninsula Jewish com
munity that will inevitably be made up, iu
large part, by the very Stanford students
1 iillel now serves.

Student condemns irrational speech
"Ad homineni attacks do not constitute
an argument."
1 am sure that everyone reading this
kis at one time or anothei heard the
adage "If you don't having anything nice
to say, don't say anything at all." I would
like to propose an altered formulation of
that piece of advice to those inclined to
voice their thoughts publicly: "If you don't
having anything rational to say, you have
nothing worth being heard." Or being
said, or being printed, for that matter.
The trademark of a good, rational
argument or position is that it proves its
premises and conclusions with sound rea
soning and concrete supporting evidence.
Unfortunately, there are a number of
ways to make an irrational, illogical argu
ment, one of which is the ad hominem fal
lacy, which runs rampant today in politics
and academia. An ad hominem argument

is one which seeks to refute an idea by
insulting those who hold it, rather than
discrediting the alleged objectivity of the
idea itself.
Do such insults change any relevant
facts or disprove a theory? No. For exam
ple, calling C.alileo an idiot or .1 "logo
phallo-centric dead white male" does not
invalidate his ideas about motion, and it
certain!) does not do any thing to validate
I'toleiney's opposing views. Similarly, an
even stronger personal attack 011 Galileo
would not increase the validity of the ad
hominem argument against his ideas. Ad
Imminent attacks achieve nothing except
obscuring the issues in question and
revealing the irrationality of their author.
It is with that iu mind that I was sur
prised and dismayed that 1 he Dailv
would publish Gideon Lewis-krauss let
ter <>1 Oct. If) ("Chappie editor defends
special fees") and that it would be given
the subhead "(ihappie editor defends spe
cial fees." Lewis-kraus did not "defend
special lees," he demoni/ed the Stanford
Review and the Stanford Guardian. 1 he
thrust of his letter was a dishonest and
demeaning assault 011 the characters of
individuals and, as a mere side-note, lie
supported granting funds to certain
groups, but only on the basis of the jeers
lie levied at those who disagree with him.
I lie question raised In the Review and
the Guardian is: Should you request vour
special fees back if you do not support
some of the groups on the list? I lie
answer, from them and from the ASSf
itself , is yes.
At the outset, I grant that the ASSU
does not choose the groups that receive
special fees and that urging students to
request back their special fees is in no way
against the ASSU, contrary to what the
Stanford Guardian has said. Iu fact, the
ASSU's position of allowing students to
request back special lees money is an
enlightened and just one. It rests on the
notion that no student is obligated to pay
fora group that they do not personally
support.
I lowever, in the process of pointing out
the way special fee groups are selected,
Lewis-kraus obscures the issue and
attacks the basic principle behind special
fees — one's right to one's own money —
iu the process of mentioning the demo

era tic selection of special fee recipients. It
is precisely a \ irtiic of the ASM ', and the
Review, here, that they do not hold am
individual student hound to the personal
selections ol his peers without his consent.
Whv, after all, does majoritv support lot a
group or idea make it right, and who gives
any student the right to vote away his
peer's money?
Far Irom wanting to merely clarify
these issues. Lewis-Kraus used his letter as
an opportunity to make ad-hoininem
attacks ol the lowest order, rather than to
try to give legitimate reasons why anyone
should support various student groups,
lake lor example the end of the first para
graph where Lcwis-kraus claims that.
"Their cowardly anonymity seems ironi
cally redundant: F.ven if" I hey olfered their
names. the\ would he only recogni/ed In
the other residents ol the unlit hobbit
holes they call home. Is that an argument
against special lee refunds or is it a child
ish insult?
While I harbor no great love for con
-servatives or the Stanford Review, 1 was
ama/ed at the vicious and unjustified
demoni/ation Lewis-kraus offered in his
letter. It seemed more at home in a Marx
ist rally than .111 intelligent college newspa
per. 111 the first paragraph of his article he
refers to the Review and (Juardian respe( -
tivelv as "the local bastion of unabashed
classism, and a bitter, anti-social individu
al."' While the word classism does not even
exist in English — I checked — if Lcwis
kraus is implving that the Review has ever
upheld the notion of a stratified and legal
ly enforced caste system, 1 believe the
record stands against him.
II he means In classism that they are
anti-communistic, then he is right, and
more power to the Review for it. Lcwis
kraus implies in the seventh paragraph
that the Review probabK holds the notion
that "AIDS is a divineh ordained epidem
ic to punish homosexuals'" and, in the
eighth paragraph, that "the Review's hope
that such organizations (minority ethnicity
groups) w ill stop kidding around and just
let rich white people run the show." In the
ninth paragraph, he makes it seem as il
the Review is against anv cultural enrich
ment as such.
I have never once seen any evidence in
the Review to support any claims of this

magnitude and I submit that neither has
Lcwis-kraus. These are absurd character
izations of a conservative point ol view .
Furthermore, these insults do not validate
the idea that ethnic groups or Alternative
Spring Break are worthy of support —
the) just attack those who disagree.
Furthermore, Lewis-kraus drops the
context of what the Review has said or
believes on two separate occasions in his
letter. I he first is the quote in his second
paragraph referring to "rise up against
[our] oppressors."' Anvone who read this
anon\ inous statement on the back page of
the recent Stanford Review knows that
this line was stated in the sarcastic context
of the Review jokingly "giving in to its
Maoist underbelly."
Secondly. Lewis-kraus asserts in para
graph six that the Review "will be quick
denounce the abilitv of tlu- students to
decide things lor themselves," but that
statement directly contradicts the letter he
quoted that supported the idea ol stu
dents dec iding lor themselves whom they
wish to support with special fees.
Worst of all is the final paragraph: "you
may hate your tiny little lives, you may be
overwhelmed In the deadncss inside of
you, but don't take that out 011 a lot of
hardworking student groups . ... (Jo kick
stray cats if you have to."
Whether you have decided to fund the
groups that Lewis-kraus pseudo-defeuds,
this quote should shock you. Bv what
right, and on what basis, does he make
such a venomous and unfounded asser
tion against the characters ol the Review
and the (iuardian? I low, in any way, does
this relate to whether or not one should
fund k/Sl ? What value does this garbage
have to anyone at an institution of learn
ing that exists on the basis of rational dis
course? In essence, this letter was not an
argument lor special lees; it was a person
al attack.
I agree that an all-out assault 011 paying
any special lees is foolish when there may
be groups you support: it is every bit as
foolish as forcing someone to pay lor a
group tliev do not support simph because
other people do support it. That does not,
however, give me the license to smear
through the mud the name of anyone
who disagrees with me without just cause
and without honest charges against them.

When I disagree with someone, I state
m\ reasons and lads. For example, I
oppose funding for ethnic groups because
I believe that they segregate the interests
of students on the basis of their race. Ihat
is rac ism and it is immoral. I would not
write that anyone who supports these
groups is the type of nihilistic ragamuffin
who goes around torturing animals. But 1
hope that il I ever did write something
like that in the future, the editors ol The
Daily would have the good sense not to
print it.
As an afterthought, I would like to
point out that there was one paragraph in
this letter that attempted to make a real,
though perhaps false, argument: for why
you should support a particular student
group, namely the Chaparral. It was
argued that you get your money's worth
in laughs. Even the Stanford Review rec
ommended that you give the ('.haparral it>
fee and did not support asking for you
motley back "unilaterally" (bottom of pg. 1
Volume XXV, No. 1). I do not agree with
their evaluation of the quality of this yeai \
Chaparral, but this does raise an interest
ing question. Perhaps Lewis-Kraus is right
in calling these people bitter. After all,
wouldn't you be bitter if Lewis-Kraus's let
ter is the way someone thanked you for
supporting them?

I am writing in response to the Oct. 9
editorial criticizing Stanford Hillel for
charging a fee for Rosh Hashana and
Yom kippur services. ("New Hillel Policy
mandates donation for High Holidays,"
Monday, Oct. 9.)
To begin, there is a central assumption

in the editorial that Ilillel at Stanford is
unique in charging for High Holiday ser
vices. 1 hi> assumption is simply untrue.
I lillel at Stanford was, in fact, the only I lil
lel in the country ih.it offered free services
to the larger Jewish community.
Additionally, a private temple would
typically charge members a full year's
worth of dues to attend I ligh I loliday ser
vices, which are frequently in excess of
one thousand dollars, in addition to
charging for High Holiday tickets. The
cost of I lillel services this year was a frac
tion of this charge.
Furthermore, the editorial challenged
that the fee was putting a price on con
necting with one's G-d. The fee for ser
vices does not represent the price of con
necting with one's G-d, but rather the
price ol the facilities, human resources,
lighting, equipment and publicity that
were required to provide two sets of High
Holiday services this year. These services
do not happen on their own — they
require tremendous human and financial
resources to occur.
Ihe editorial then goes on to say,
"leldstein said that Ilillel will not turn
away anyone for whom the cost of services
is a concern. I here is an inconsistency
here with the beginning of the editorial
where it is intimated that this fee barred
community members from attending ser
vices. A second and more important point
is that most members of the community
can aflord to pay the small fee. This is dis
missed by the editorial as "hardly being
the point" when it is in reality just that.
Why should Hillel spend monies that
would otherwise go toward funding stu
dent programming on free services that
the community at large can allbrd? flu
simple fact is that someone must pay lor
these services. The question then
becomes, who should pay? Students, for
whom the organization was created, or a
wealthy local Jewish community that is
frequently a beneficiary of IlillcTs
services?
I he answer is clear: Local community
members that can allbrd the suggested
donation to attend High Holiday services
should pay it unbegrudgingly and, if
nothing else, consider it a long-term
investment in the Peninsula Jewish com
munity that will inevitably be made up, iu
large part, by the very Stanford students

Student condemns irrational speech
"Ad homineni attacks do not constitute
an argument."
1 am sure that everyone reading this
kis at one time or anothei heard the
adage "If you don't having anything nice
to say, don't say anything at all." I would
like to propose an altered formulation of
that piece of advice to those inclined to
voice their thoughts publicly: "If you don't
having anything rational to say, you have
nothing worth being heard." Or being
said, or being printed, for that matter.
The trademark of a good, rational
argument or position is that it proves its
premises and conclusions with sound rea
soning and concrete supporting evidence.
Unfortunately, there are a number of
ways to make an irrational, illogical argu
ment, one of which is the ad hominem fal
lacy, which runs rampant today in politics
and academia. An ad hominem argument

is one which seeks to refute an idea by
insulting those who hold it, rather than
discrediting the alleged objectivity of the
idea itself.
Do such insults change any relevant
facts or disprove a theory? No. For exam
ple, calling C.alileo an idiot or .1 "logo
phallo-centric dead white male" does not
invalidate his ideas about motion, and it
certain!) does not do any thing to validate
I'toleiney's opposing views. Similarly, an
even stronger personal attack 011 Galileo
would not increase the validity of the ad
hominem argument against his ideas. Ad
Imminent attacks achieve nothing except
obscuring the issues in question and
revealing the irrationality of their author.
It is with that iu mind that I was sur
prised and dismayed that 1 he Dailv
would publish Gideon Lewis-krauss let
ter <>1 Oct. If) ("Chappie editor defends
special fees") and that it would be given
the subhead "(ihappie editor defends spe
cial fees." Lewis-kraus did not "defend
special lees," he demoni/ed the Stanford
Review and the Stanford Guardian. 1 he
thrust of his letter was a dishonest and
demeaning assault 011 the characters of
individuals and, as a mere side-note, lie
supported granting funds to certain
groups, but only on the basis of the jeers
lie levied at those who disagree with him.
I lie question raised In the Review and
the Guardian is: Should you request vour
special fees back if you do not support
some of the groups on the list? I lie
answer, from them and from the ASSf
itself , is yes.
At the outset, I grant that the ASSU
does not choose the groups that receive
special fees and that urging students to
request back their special fees is in no way
against the ASSU, contrary to what the
Stanford Guardian has said. Iu fact, the
ASSU's position of allowing students to
request back special lees money is an
enlightened and just one. It rests on the
notion that no student is obligated to pay
fora group that they do not personally
support.
I lowever, in the process of pointing out
the way special fee groups are selected,
Lewis-kraus obscures the issue and
attacks the basic principle behind special
fees — one's right to one's own money —
iu the process of mentioning the demo

era tic selection of special fee recipients. It
is precisely a \ irtiic of the ASM ', and the
Review, here, that they do not hold am
individual student hound to the personal
selections ol his peers without his consent.
Whv, after all, does majoritv support lot a
group or idea make it right, and who gives
any student the right to vote away his
peer's money?
Far Irom wanting to merely clarify
these issues. Lewis-Kraus used his letter as
an opportunity to make ad-hoininem
attacks ol the lowest order, rather than to
try to give legitimate reasons why anyone
should support various student groups,
lake lor example the end of the first para
graph where Lcwis-kraus claims that.
"Their cowardly anonymity seems ironi
cally redundant: F.ven if" I hey olfered their
names. the\ would he only recogni/ed In
the other residents ol the unlit hobbit
holes they call home. Is that an argument
against special lee refunds or is it a child
ish insult?
While I harbor no great love for con
-servatives or the Stanford Review, 1 was
ama/ed at the vicious and unjustified
demoni/ation Lewis-kraus offered in his
letter. It seemed more at home in a Marx
ist rally than .111 intelligent college newspa
per. 111 the first paragraph of his article he
refers to the Review and (Juardian respe( -
tivelv as "the local bastion of unabashed
classism, and a bitter, anti-social individu
al."' While the word classism does not even
exist in English — I checked — if Lcwis
kraus is implving that the Review has ever
upheld the notion of a stratified and legal
ly enforced caste system, 1 believe the
record stands against him.
II he means In classism that they are
anti-communistic, then he is right, and
more power to the Review for it. Lcwis
kraus implies in the seventh paragraph
that the Review probabK holds the notion
that "AIDS is a divineh ordained epidem
ic to punish homosexuals'" and, in the
eighth paragraph, that "the Review's hope
that such organizations (minority ethnicity
groups) w ill stop kidding around and just
let rich white people run the show." In the
ninth paragraph, he makes it seem as il
the Review is against anv cultural enrich
ment as such.
I have never once seen any evidence in
the Review to support any claims of this

magnitude and I submit that neither has
Lcwis-kraus. These are absurd character
izations of a conservative point ol view .
Furthermore, these insults do not validate
the idea that ethnic groups or Alternative
Spring Break are worthy of support —
the) just attack those who disagree.
Furthermore, Lewis-kraus drops the
context of what the Review has said or
believes on two separate occasions in his
letter. I he first is the quote in his second
paragraph referring to "rise up against
[our] oppressors."' Anvone who read this
anon\ inous statement on the back page of
the recent Stanford Review knows that
this line was stated in the sarcastic context
of the Review jokingly "giving in to its
Maoist underbelly."
Secondly. Lewis-kraus asserts in para
graph six that the Review "will be quick
denounce the abilitv of tlu- students to
decide things lor themselves," but that
statement directly contradicts the letter he
quoted that supported the idea ol stu
dents dec iding lor themselves whom they
wish to support with special fees.
Worst of all is the final paragraph: "you
may hate your tiny little lives, you may be
overwhelmed In the deadncss inside of
you, but don't take that out 011 a lot of
hardworking student groups . ... (Jo kick
stray cats if you have to."
Whether you have decided to fund the
groups that Lewis-kraus pseudo-defeuds,
this quote should shock you. Bv what
right, and on what basis, does he make
such a venomous and unfounded asser
tion against the characters ol the Review
and the (iuardian? I low, in any way, does
this relate to whether or not one should
fund k/Sl ? What value does this garbage
have to anyone at an institution of learn
ing that exists on the basis of rational dis
course? In essence, this letter was not an
argument lor special lees; it was a person
al attack.
I agree that an all-out assault 011 paying
any special lees is foolish when there may
be groups you support: it is every bit as
foolish as forcing someone to pay lor a
group tliev do not support simph because
other people do support it. That does not,
however, give me the license to smear
through the mud the name of anyone
who disagrees with me without just cause
and without honest charges against them.

When I disagree with someone, I state
m\ reasons and lads. For example, I
oppose funding for ethnic groups because
I believe that they segregate the interests
of students on the basis of their race. Ihat
is rac ism and it is immoral. I would not
write that anyone who supports these
groups is the type of nihilistic ragamuffin
who goes around torturing animals. But 1
hope that il I ever did write something
like that in the future, the editors ol The
Daily would have the good sense not to
print it.
As an afterthought, I would like to
point out that there was one paragraph in
this letter that attempted to make a real,
though perhaps false, argument: for why
you should support a particular student
group, namely the Chaparral. It was
argued that you get your money's worth
in laughs. Even the Stanford Review rec
ommended that you give the ('.haparral it>
fee and did not support asking for you
motley back "unilaterally" (bottom of pg. 1
Volume XXV, No. 1). I do not agree with
their evaluation of the quality of this yeai \
Chaparral, but this does raise an interest
ing question. Perhaps Lewis-Kraus is right
in calling these people bitter. After all,
wouldn't you be bitter if Lewis-Kraus's let
ter is the way someone thanked you for
supporting them?

Former Hillel board member defends
donation request
The Daily's condemnation ol HiUel's
new policy ol requesting $180 donations
foi I ligh I folv Daws tic kets displays a lack
of understanding of the factors that led
the Stanford Hillel Board — painfully —
to reach this decision.
Among the most salient were these:
First, with services open to the public at no
charge, the Liberal Services filled Memo
rial Auditorium twice over for every ser
vice. I his means that the Hillel rabbi was
required to put on back-to-back services
— each of them three hours or more in
length. Many times, Hillel had to hire, .it
significant expense, outside rabbis to assist
with the eflort required by two services.
Second, local synagogues in the com
munity have for years urged Hillel not to
provide free services in the hope that
unaffiliated Jews would join congrega
tions. Indeed, we understand that atten
dance at synagogue services substantially
increased this year.
I hird, Stanford llilicl is not like any
other religious organization on campus. It
is neither affiliated with a local place of
worship tlicit would provide financial sup
port, as are so many of the affiliated cam
pus ministries, nor does it receive any sup
port from the University.
Unlike the religious groups that con
duct services by University chaplains,
whose salaries are paid by the University -
in Memorial Church, a magnificent facili
ty fully supported by the University, - I fil

lei is completely financially independent
of Stanford. Indeed. Stanford, for the first
lime this year, charged llillel the full cost
lor providing security lor I lillel s services!
Finally, and most importantly, while
some of our students expressed enthusi
asm for having I lillel s services be popu
lated by community members, many oth
ers expressed a desire to be with fellow
members of the Stanford family on High
Holy Days, so that they did not walk into
a large auditorium filled with people thev
didn't know or recognize.
This year, Stanford students were on
the bima at the close of Yom Kippur ser
vices: in previous years, school-aged chil
dren were the ones granted that special
privilege. Stanford Hillel's mission is to
serve Stanford students. The new policy,
while imperfect, was a concerned Board's
attempt to c reate a sense of a welcoming
and identifiable Jewish campus communi
ty for our students.

Student condemns irrational speech
"Ad homineni attacks do not constitute
an argument."
1 am sure that everyone reading this
kis at one time or anothei heard the
adage "If you don't having anything nice
to say, don't say anything at all." I would
like to propose an altered formulation of
that piece of advice to those inclined to
voice their thoughts publicly: "If you don't
having anything rational to say, you have
nothing worth being heard." Or being
said, or being printed, for that matter.
The trademark of a good, rational
argument or position is that it proves its
premises and conclusions with sound rea
soning and concrete supporting evidence.
Unfortunately, there are a number of
ways to make an irrational, illogical argu
ment, one of which is the ad hominem fal
lacy, which runs rampant today in politics
and academia. An ad hominem argument

is one which seeks to refute an idea by
insulting those who hold it, rather than
discrediting the alleged objectivity of the
idea itself.
Do such insults change any relevant
facts or disprove a theory? No. For exam
ple, calling C.alileo an idiot or .1 "logo
phallo-centric dead white male" does not
invalidate his ideas about motion, and it
certain!) does not do any thing to validate
I'toleiney's opposing views. Similarly, an
even stronger personal attack 011 Galileo
would not increase the validity of the ad
hominem argument against his ideas. Ad
Imminent attacks achieve nothing except
obscuring the issues in question and
revealing the irrationality of their author.
It is with that iu mind that I was sur
prised and dismayed that 1 he Dailv
would publish Gideon Lewis-krauss let
ter <>1 Oct. If) ("Chappie editor defends
special fees") and that it would be given
the subhead "(ihappie editor defends spe
cial fees." Lewis-kraus did not "defend
special lees," he demoni/ed the Stanford
Review and the Stanford Guardian. 1 he
thrust of his letter was a dishonest and
demeaning assault 011 the characters of
individuals and, as a mere side-note, lie
supported granting funds to certain
groups, but only on the basis of the jeers
lie levied at those who disagree with him.
I lie question raised In the Review and
the Guardian is: Should you request vour
special fees back if you do not support
some of the groups on the list? I lie
answer, from them and from the ASSf
itself , is yes.
At the outset, I grant that the ASSU
does not choose the groups that receive
special fees and that urging students to
request back their special fees is in no way
against the ASSU, contrary to what the
Stanford Guardian has said. Iu fact, the
ASSU's position of allowing students to
request back special lees money is an
enlightened and just one. It rests on the
notion that no student is obligated to pay
fora group that they do not personally
support.
I lowever, in the process of pointing out
the way special fee groups are selected,
Lewis-kraus obscures the issue and
attacks the basic principle behind special
fees — one's right to one's own money —
iu the process of mentioning the demo

era tic selection of special fee recipients. It
is precisely a \ irtiic of the ASM ', and the
Review, here, that they do not hold am
individual student hound to the personal
selections ol his peers without his consent.
Whv, after all, does majoritv support lot a
group or idea make it right, and who gives
any student the right to vote away his
peer's money?
Far Irom wanting to merely clarify
these issues. Lewis-Kraus used his letter as
an opportunity to make ad-hoininem
attacks ol the lowest order, rather than to
try to give legitimate reasons why anyone
should support various student groups,
lake lor example the end of the first para
graph where Lcwis-kraus claims that.
"Their cowardly anonymity seems ironi
cally redundant: F.ven if" I hey olfered their
names. the\ would he only recogni/ed In
the other residents ol the unlit hobbit
holes they call home. Is that an argument
against special lee refunds or is it a child
ish insult?
While I harbor no great love for con
-servatives or the Stanford Review, 1 was
ama/ed at the vicious and unjustified
demoni/ation Lewis-kraus offered in his
letter. It seemed more at home in a Marx
ist rally than .111 intelligent college newspa
per. 111 the first paragraph of his article he
refers to the Review and (Juardian respe( -
tivelv as "the local bastion of unabashed
classism, and a bitter, anti-social individu
al."' While the word classism does not even
exist in English — I checked — if Lcwis
kraus is implving that the Review has ever
upheld the notion of a stratified and legal
ly enforced caste system, 1 believe the
record stands against him.
II he means In classism that they are
anti-communistic, then he is right, and
more power to the Review for it. Lcwis
kraus implies in the seventh paragraph
that the Review probabK holds the notion
that "AIDS is a divineh ordained epidem
ic to punish homosexuals'" and, in the
eighth paragraph, that "the Review's hope
that such organizations (minority ethnicity
groups) w ill stop kidding around and just
let rich white people run the show." In the
ninth paragraph, he makes it seem as il
the Review is against anv cultural enrich
ment as such.
I have never once seen any evidence in
the Review to support any claims of this

magnitude and I submit that neither has
Lcwis-kraus. These are absurd character
izations of a conservative point ol view .
Furthermore, these insults do not validate
the idea that ethnic groups or Alternative
Spring Break are worthy of support —
the) just attack those who disagree.
Furthermore, Lewis-kraus drops the
context of what the Review has said or
believes on two separate occasions in his
letter. I he first is the quote in his second
paragraph referring to "rise up against
[our] oppressors."' Anvone who read this
anon\ inous statement on the back page of
the recent Stanford Review knows that
this line was stated in the sarcastic context
of the Review jokingly "giving in to its
Maoist underbelly."
Secondly. Lewis-kraus asserts in para
graph six that the Review "will be quick
denounce the abilitv of tlu- students to
decide things lor themselves," but that
statement directly contradicts the letter he
quoted that supported the idea ol stu
dents dec iding lor themselves whom they
wish to support with special fees.
Worst of all is the final paragraph: "you
may hate your tiny little lives, you may be
overwhelmed In the deadncss inside of
you, but don't take that out 011 a lot of
hardworking student groups . ... (Jo kick
stray cats if you have to."
Whether you have decided to fund the
groups that Lewis-kraus pseudo-defeuds,
this quote should shock you. Bv what
right, and on what basis, does he make
such a venomous and unfounded asser
tion against the characters ol the Review
and the (iuardian? I low, in any way, does
this relate to whether or not one should
fund k/Sl ? What value does this garbage
have to anyone at an institution of learn
ing that exists on the basis of rational dis
course? In essence, this letter was not an
argument lor special lees; it was a person
al attack.
I agree that an all-out assault 011 paying
any special lees is foolish when there may
be groups you support: it is every bit as
foolish as forcing someone to pay lor a
group tliev do not support simph because
other people do support it. That does not,
however, give me the license to smear
through the mud the name of anyone
who disagrees with me without just cause
and without honest charges against them.

When I disagree with someone, I state
m\ reasons and lads. For example, I
oppose funding for ethnic groups because
I believe that they segregate the interests
of students on the basis of their race. Ihat
is rac ism and it is immoral. I would not
write that anyone who supports these
groups is the type of nihilistic ragamuffin
who goes around torturing animals. But 1
hope that il I ever did write something
like that in the future, the editors ol The
Daily would have the good sense not to
print it.
As an afterthought, I would like to
point out that there was one paragraph in
this letter that attempted to make a real,
though perhaps false, argument: for why
you should support a particular student
group, namely the Chaparral. It was
argued that you get your money's worth
in laughs. Even the Stanford Review rec
ommended that you give the ('.haparral it>
fee and did not support asking for you
motley back "unilaterally" (bottom of pg. 1
Volume XXV, No. 1). I do not agree with
their evaluation of the quality of this yeai \
Chaparral, but this does raise an interest
ing question. Perhaps Lewis-Kraus is right
in calling these people bitter. After all,
wouldn't you be bitter if Lewis-Kraus's let
ter is the way someone thanked you for
supporting them?

Former Hillel board member defends
donation request
The Daily's condemnation ol HiUel's
new policy ol requesting $180 donations
foi I ligh I folv Daws tic kets displays a lack
of understanding of the factors that led
the Stanford Hillel Board — painfully —
to reach this decision.
Among the most salient were these:
First, with services open to the public at no
charge, the Liberal Services filled Memo
rial Auditorium twice over for every ser
vice. I his means that the Hillel rabbi was
required to put on back-to-back services
— each of them three hours or more in
length. Many times, Hillel had to hire, .it
significant expense, outside rabbis to assist
with the eflort required by two services.
Second, local synagogues in the com
munity have for years urged Hillel not to
provide free services in the hope that
unaffiliated Jews would join congrega
tions. Indeed, we understand that atten
dance at synagogue services substantially
increased this year.
I hird, Stanford llilicl is not like any
other religious organization on campus. It
is neither affiliated with a local place of
worship tlicit would provide financial sup
port, as are so many of the affiliated cam
pus ministries, nor does it receive any sup
port from the University.
Unlike the religious groups that con
duct services by University chaplains,
whose salaries are paid by the University -
in Memorial Church, a magnificent facili
ty fully supported by the University, - I fil

lei is completely financially independent
of Stanford. Indeed. Stanford, for the first
lime this year, charged llillel the full cost
lor providing security lor I lillel s services!
Finally, and most importantly, while
some of our students expressed enthusi
asm for having I lillel s services be popu
lated by community members, many oth
ers expressed a desire to be with fellow
members of the Stanford family on High
Holy Days, so that they did not walk into
a large auditorium filled with people thev
didn't know or recognize.
This year, Stanford students were on
the bima at the close of Yom Kippur ser
vices: in previous years, school-aged chil
dren were the ones granted that special
privilege. Stanford Hillel's mission is to
serve Stanford students. The new policy,
while imperfect, was a concerned Board's
attempt to c reate a sense of a welcoming
and identifiable Jewish campus communi
ty for our students.
ROBIN KKNNKDY

President Emerila, Stanford llillel Hoard of Dnertors

Student defends Hillel policy
I am writing in response to the Oct. 9
editorial criticizing Stanford Hillel for
charging a fee for Rosh Hashana and
Yom kippur services. ("New Hillel Policy
mandates donation for High Holidays,"
Monday, Oct. 9.)
To begin, there is a central assumption

in the editorial that Ilillel at Stanford is
unique in charging for High Holiday ser
vices. 1 hi> assumption is simply untrue.
I lillel at Stanford was, in fact, the only I lil
lel in the country ih.it offered free services
to the larger Jewish community.
Additionally, a private temple would
typically charge members a full year's
worth of dues to attend I ligh I loliday ser
vices, which are frequently in excess of
one thousand dollars, in addition to
charging for High Holiday tickets. The
cost of I lillel services this year was a frac
tion of this charge.
Furthermore, the editorial challenged
that the fee was putting a price on con
necting with one's G-d. The fee for ser
vices does not represent the price of con
necting with one's G-d, but rather the
price ol the facilities, human resources,
lighting, equipment and publicity that
were required to provide two sets of High
Holiday services this year. These services
do not happen on their own — they
require tremendous human and financial
resources to occur.
Ihe editorial then goes on to say,
"leldstein said that Ilillel will not turn
away anyone for whom the cost of services
is a concern. I here is an inconsistency
here with the beginning of the editorial
where it is intimated that this fee barred
community members from attending ser
vices. A second and more important point
is that most members of the community
can aflord to pay the small fee. This is dis
missed by the editorial as "hardly being
the point" when it is in reality just that.
Why should Hillel spend monies that
would otherwise go toward funding stu
dent programming on free services that
the community at large can allbrd? flu
simple fact is that someone must pay lor
these services. The question then
becomes, who should pay? Students, for
whom the organization was created, or a
wealthy local Jewish community that is
frequently a beneficiary of IlillcTs
services?
I he answer is clear: Local community
members that can allbrd the suggested
donation to attend High Holiday services
should pay it unbegrudgingly and, if
nothing else, consider it a long-term
investment in the Peninsula Jewish com
munity that will inevitably be made up, iu
large part, by the very Stanford students
