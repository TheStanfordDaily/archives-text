# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Students will help maintain strengths of Kyoto Protocol 
### CAROLYN KOUSKY GUEST COLUMNIST 
The last chapter of the Clinton /
Gore environmental legacy will
be written next month in the
Netherlands at the sixth round
of negotiations over the international
global warming treaty, the Kyoto Proto
col. I his administration can undo eight
years of international effort by including
loopholes li>r industry and sacrificing our
environmental future to corporate pol
luters, or it can lead the world to an effec
tive Protocol that substantially cuts global
warming pollution.
I wo hundred U.S. students are going
to the 11 ague this November to make sure
that the United States delegates make the
tight decision. Seven of these students are
from Stanford.
Negotiated in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol
is an international agreement that sets
mandatory greenhouse gas emission tar
gets for developed countries. The United
States' target is to reduce emissions to 7
percent below 1990 levels. 1 he momen
tum for the Kyoto Protocol began in 1988
when the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change was established to assess

current research on climate change and
the possible impacts of human-induced
global warming.
l he IPCC released its First Assessment
Report in 1990, reflecting work done by
scientists and experts from around the
world. This report led to the United
Nations Framework Convention on Cli
mate Change at the Karth Summit in Rio
in 1992. I he United States and other
countries ratified the convention in 1992,
which established voluntary reduction tar
gets for industrialized countries.
However, to elate, only Germany and
the United Kingdom have reached those
first goals of reducing emissions to 1990
levels. Since then, the Kyoto Protocol has
made emissions reductions mandatory in
developed nations. Because it has yet to
be ratified by a majority of the signing
countries, however, the protocol is not yet
in force.
Many see people this upcoming round
of negotiations as a make-or-break meet
ing. Currently, there are mechanisms
included in the protocol that allow coun
tries to reach their reduction targets In
means other than the actual reduction of
emissions. These so-called "flexible mech
anisms'' have the potential to undermine

the purpose of (lie treaty by including
dangerous loopholes. Responding to the
intense lobbying ellbrt ol the oil, coal and
nuclear industries, the United States dele
gation supports these loopholes.
I he 200 U.S. students are going to the
session in the Hague to let the United
States delegates know that that they
should not cause more environmental
problems while trying to solve this one.
Loopholes must be closed.
I liree issues arc of partk nlar concern
to the students. I he first has to do with <i
flexible mechanism called the Clean
Development Mechanism, which allows a
country to receive emissions reduction
"credit" when ii helps cut pollution in a
developing country. I his mechanism
allows lor the transfer of green technolo
gy and helps developing countries
advance sustainably and leap-frog over
brown technology.
1 lowever, due to industry pressure, the
United States is proposing that nuclear
power and "clean coal" count as sustain
able technologies, which they are most
certainly not.
I lie public is keenly aware of the dan
gers of nuclear tcchnologv, including
toxic waste by-products that pose serious

heath risks. I he\ might not realize, how
ever, that "clean coal" is not c lean at all,
but only removes sulfur oxides 112 rom emis
sions, letting the greenhouse gases contin
ue to pour into our atmosphere.
Students are going to the Hague to
make it clear that there should be no
nuclear energ) and no coal allowed in the
Clean Development Mechanism.
The treaty's use of carbon sinks as a
way to receive emission reduction credits
is the second issue of concern. A carbon
sink is anvthing that absorbs carbon diox
ide, such as a forest. I here are several
problems with the U.S. proposal as it now
stands.
1 here is scientific consensus that, in
order to substantially curb global wann
ing, 70 percent of our emissions must be
cut. I lie protocol calls for less than half
that reduction, and sinks have the
potential to undermine even that small
er goal. 1 he protocol must focus on
reduc ing emissions at the source. I lie
capacity for land to store carbon is finite;
we cannot rely on sinks to seriously stop
global wanning.
Further, if emission reduction c redit is
given for sinks, ii will diminish the incen
tive to invest in the research and develop

mint of renewable technologies. Fora
serious, long-term solution, we must enact
a significant shilt in our energy sources
awa\ from lossil fuels and towards sustain
able technologies.
Third, land planted with young, mono
culture, genetically altered pine trees
maximizes the absorption of carbon.
1 hese invasive and unnatural measures
cannot be given prioritv over restoring
our important native ecosystems, such as
prairies and ancient forests. In sum, a car
bon sequestration focus must not under
mine other environmental goals.
Students across the country are calling
on the I'.S. delegation to keep the Kyoto
Protocol strong. I hey want the American
public to realize the importance of this
global wanning treat\ and to help pressure
the I Inited States into being a leader on c li
mate change solutions. We all must act
quic klv if we wish to curb climate change.
B\ working together for eflective global
warming solutions, we can reverse recent
trends and leave a stable climate and
healthy ecosystems for future generations.
