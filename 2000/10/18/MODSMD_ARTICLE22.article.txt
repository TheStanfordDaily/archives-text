W hen construction was completed a few months

liven'. slif said she received uncleai responses.
" 1 he\ said it it was addressed correcth. the mail

the address the p<>si office gave lis — the 'correct
one — \et the mail still nevei comes."


In general, students have been satisfied with the new post office, complete
with a new postal retail store and a surrounding glass wall
In 1998. the Department ol An
thropology split into two separate
departments. I he Department ol
Cultural and Social Anthropology
remained in Building 110, while
the Anthropological Sciences De
partment moved to Building 360.
As a result of the split, some
lacultx and stall who used to work,
in Building 110 now work in
Building 360.

Abt said that the mail is being
delivered to Building 1 10, where
the Department of Anthropology
was located before its split. Accord
ing to her, the issue will not be re
solved in the future.
"[The post office] told 1 1 ic- to just
let it go," Abt said.
Kddie Masangcav, manager of
customer service for the Palo Alto
station, savs misaddressing mail is
still the problem.
"The mail for Building 300 is
handled bv a courier service which
operates out of our station," he
said. "We could actually deliver cli

rectly to [Anthropological Sci
ences] if they labeled their mail
with the department name, fol
lowed by 'Building 360.' "
If not, Masangcay said that mail
would probabh be sent to the Engi
neering Department — which
used to occupy Building 360 before
renovations — or to Building 110.
'"When Engineering moved
out [of Building 300], they still
kept the same mailing address,"
he said. "My couriers get thou
sands of pieces of mail each day. It
becomes very hard to make dis
tinctions."
