at Stanford. I'll bet at least as many

Loyalty, strength and courage are the
watchwords of a samurai-warrior. Only one
who respects his roots, demonstrates power in
the line ol duty and dares to set goals beyond
the ordinary is worthy to carry the samurai
blade.
When Riall Johnson brought an actual
samurai blade into the locker room .n the be
ginning of the 1999 season, he sought to chan
nel that same warrior spirit onto the football
field. During the Pacific 10 (Conference open
er against Washington State, the fifth-year se
nior outside linebacker sliced through the op
posing offense to record five sac ks, including
a fourth quarter safety. The Pat -10 honored
him as Defensive Player of the Week, and his
ancient weapon has been sheathed .it every
battle since.
1 he sword traveled to US(C a few weeks
later as Johnson's three tackles fora loss, two
sac ks and forced fumble slew the I lojans in
an upset comeback win, 35-31. lie brought
the sword this season when he attacked then-
No. 5 Texas and came away with four tackles
lot losses and three sacks, garnering the I SA
I < >dav Pac-1 () ('.< Hiference I Mayer of t he Week
award.
I lie sword Johnson totes to each game is
the medium version ol <i three-part set given
to him by his older brother Ahmani, who was
a standout at linebacker lor ()regon State and
went on to play several years in the (Canadian
Football League. I he swords have become a
sort of family licit loom, but no one will mis
take the 6'CV', '240 pound Johnson fora native
of Japan.
"[Ahmani] played 'Sam' backer, which is
what I play, and at his school they called it
samurai backer, " Johnson explains. "I like to
think of football as going to war. To me [the
swords are] something to help get your mind
right, to get that warrior mentality. "
Johnson's most notable role on the battle

field is that of quarterback-slayer. 1 -ist year In
led the conference with 13 sacks, and was dec
orated .is second-leant All-Pac -10. This season
he is on pace to beat that total, with eight sacks
alter six games. Opposing coaches have
begun specially preparing their oflenscs to
deal with Rialls onslaught — but usu;ill\ to
no avail.
"You have to figure out some wav to con
tain and stop him," said Stanford head coach
Tyrone Willinglutm. "lie finds ,i new wa\
every week to get to the quarterback."
Johnson s success is partly due to a position
c hange before last season, where he moved
Irom defensive end tooutside linebac ker. I he
'Sam' backer is ,i position that better suits his
quickness and anticipation than the defensive
line.
Willingham praised the hard work John
son put into perlecting his defensive adjust
ment —yet ii shouldn't be surprising, given
that Johnson always holds himself to high
standards.
"Personally, I want to go back to the Rose
Bowl. I hat's the first thing." said |ohnson.
"I'm hoping to go for All-Anicrican. I'm going
lor the Butkus Trophy [given annually to the
nation's best linebac ker|. I'm si ill on the list lot
it; il not then at least I set m\ goals high. II I'm
(lose enough then I'll si ill be satisfied."
Mis competitiveness is natural, given that
he grew up in <i lamih ol elite athletes. Born
in Lynwood, Wash., |ohnson watched his
older brothel dominate on the field, provid
ing a basis lor his own excellence.
"I would not be- as good a football player ii
it wasn't lor tnv older brother." Johnson said.
"I le's my inspiration and tnv hero. I le's who
I watched growing up. ()thcr people had pro
players, but I had someone close to me to
model myself alter."
Being raised in Ahmani s shadow instilled
a fire in |oluison to surpass his brother. I hat
Maine has now been passed on to Rialls little
brother, leyo, though the f>'7 , 2">(j-pound
Stanford freshman can hardh be c alled little.

I'eyo was a prized recruit both as a quarter
back .ind as a forward on the basketball team,
and Riall was itisti umental in I'evo's dec ision
to join the (lardinal.
"It has helped me discipline in\ self being
here at Stanford." said Riall. "You realize
you have to be on top of even thing, you're
on your own here; you're not pampered
like you are at other schools. I hat's one <>l
the reasons 1 told my little brother to come
here, cause 1 wanted him to be able to ex
perience t his."
Riall s competitiveness deliniteh extends
beyond the plaving field, lie loves video
games and is open tochallengei s. P>nt be fore
warned, he admits that those on the football
team know him as the (.ameinastei. Riall's ca
maraderie with his brother this season lias
matured both players, and Riall < itc-s I'evo's
presence as a mental advantage to his perfbi -
mance, providing a chance to relax more than
in past seasons.
"It's a lot more fun having him here this
year on the team, ' Riall said. "We reminisce
on old childhood stuff and I'm goofing
around in practice a lot more I think. But I'm
still staying focused."
So far this year has been challenging for
Riall and the entire Cardinal squad as tlie\
have failed to live up theii own expectations
so far, coming oil their Rose Bow l vear. But
the talented Johnson expects gi eat things lot
himself on the gridiron not onl\ in the re
mainder of this season, but in the wais that
follow, lie cannot help but think of the future
and thcopportunitiesawailing him in Ins pro
fessional career.
"I locus on the now but I do keep the fu
ture in mind, because knowing what I could
do in the 112 uture c an help motivate mc for what
I can do now." |olmson said.
What he can do now is continue toe oncjuei
the line of scrimmage, as offenses fill to the
sharp linebac kei that slashes into their bac k
lielcl with (lie power and determination of a
samurai
