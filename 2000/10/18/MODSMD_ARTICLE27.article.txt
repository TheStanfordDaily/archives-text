you're serious about improving
the quality of the league instead of
filling it full of apple-cheeked
American college boys who can't
hang with the best.
2) MLS, meet advertising. Ad
vertising, meet MLS.
Do you remember that slick
marketing campaign with awesome
highlights .uul screaming fans
going insane in the stands? ()h, wait
— that never happened. People
aren't going to watch the Tampa
Bay Mutiny play the Columbus
Crew if thev don't know what the

hell Ml -S is. (lough up a little more
dough and buy some ads.
;*)'! ry and get a real soccer stadium.
1 he most depressing sight on
SportsClenter, at least the one time
a month when thev show MLS
highlights, has got to be the thou
sands and thousands o! empty
seats at MLS games. No one's ex
pecting the league to lill 80,000
seats at Arrowhead anytime soon,
but it looks reallv bad when there
are more birds than people in the
stands, follow the lead of the
Columbus Crew, build your own
small stadium (20-25,000 people)
and make the environment more

I know mv advice tends to lean
toward the "spend millions and

millions of dollars" categorv, but
the reality of the situation is that
you have to spend money to make
money. The MLS poobahs have
to decide within the next couple
of years whethei thev're gonna
put up or shut up, and coughing
up the dough is the wav to linall)
put up.
Who knows, maybe the com
missioner is reading this (I li, Don)
will decide finally to do something,
fhen I might be able to point .it
my sports-snob 112 riends who laugh
.it soccer and utter those four
sweet words: I told you so.
