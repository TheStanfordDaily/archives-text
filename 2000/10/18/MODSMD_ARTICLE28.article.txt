Initial findings from a pilot
study conducted by Stanford re
searchers hypothesize that the
nausea many women experience
during pregnancy may be linked
to their sense of smell.
Richard Blum and Leßoy
Heinrichs, both doctors of gyne
cology and obstetrics at the School
of Medicine, recently co-authored
the first comprehensive book on
nausea and vomiting, aptly named
"Nausea and Vomiting: ( herview.
Challenges, Practical Treatments,
and New Perspectives."
I he book is based upon a fun
damental theory of nausea and
vomiting that could lend greater
insight into the main ways iu
which man and nature interact.
"Nausea is a very sensitive indica
tor of how we are getting along in
the outside world, much of which
is man-made," said Blum. "It is a
response to stimuli with which we
can cope and functions as a funda
mental warning system.
Blum and Heinrichs believe
that the primitive being — 'Lucy,'
perhaps — didn't have to deal as
extensively with phenomena like
nausea and vomiting because the
two are responses to man creating
situations that his brain cannot
deal with.
"Our research suggests that al
most all of the stimuli for pregnan
cy, nausea and vomiting are odors,
probably as a result of the Interac
tivity of the olfactory system, which
rises with levels of estrogen during

pregnancy," Blum said.
"Kven without regard to preg
nancy, women are three times as
susceptible to nausea and vomiting
as men. The majority of women
rate it as one of the most painful
experiences of their lives. And no
one has the foggiest notion of win
this is true — it's one of the great
est mysteries in science."
According to data from earlier
studies, women who have nausea
in the early stages of pregnane v are
less likely to miscarry. A healthy
placenta produces estrogen early
in pregnancv. If the placenta is not
producing enough estrogen (at
levels that should instigate nau
sea), there is an associated problem
with the pregnancy and, conse
quently, a greater c hance of mis
carriage.
Both doctors have found that
women from clinical and formal
studies at Stanford report smell as
a common trigger for nausea. "We
discovered what ever}' woman has
known for eons." said Blum.
" I hey often state that the smell of
cooking foods, cigarette smoke,
petroleum products — anything
volatile — triggers nausea. Fatigue
and job-stress as precipitators of
nausea have also been exceedingly
common reports."
But 1 leinrichs added, "()ur hy
pothesis of olfaction as being im
portant. if not the primary trigger
for nausea was supported, but I
emphasize that this is pilot data.
We're developing In pothescs here
that still need to be tested."
"Nausea and Vomiting" was
compiled In 20 students, 20 fac ul

tv members and one additional co
anlhor. The book emphasizes the
experiences ol'women and dispels
common misconceptions— lor ex
ample, that vomiting "expels tox
ins" or is cathartic.
Heinrichs and Blum disagree
with the common "Darwinian" no
tion that nausea and vomiting is
somehow benefit ial.
"Vomiting is not 'protective ol
women but maladaptive. Ilein
rit lis explained. " I he majorit\ ol

women rate it as one of the most
painful experiences of their
lives."
In 198 I. both doctors received a
letter Irom a woman wh<>se daugh
ter spent three weeks at Stanford
I lospital with ;i severe case ol nau
sea. I he voting woman tailed tore
covet despite increasing medical
bills.
A neighbor suggested ginger
and, aliei three d.i\s of drinking
ginger tea, the daughter was on

the load to recovery. The mother]
wrote to Blum and I leinrichs sa\-
ing, 'Alter 1 spent all this money on
m\ daughter in the hospital and
simple ginger worked, please do
something to learn more about
nausea! ".And she was right. We
were very grateful to her," Blum
said.
Heinrichs also had a personal
interest in exploring the intimate
connection between nausea and
smell: his son. For years his son suf

lered motion sickness on airplanes
and drugs provided no relief.
"()ne da\ we were taxiing," I lein
richs s.iid, ".ind he started getting
nauseous. 'Don't you smell that
awful smell?' he asked me. I sup
pose ii was kerosene fuel.
"But the next time, he popped a
piece ol peppermint iu his mouth
before he boarded the plane, and
now he ilies everywhere with no
trouble — as long as he takes his
peppermint."
