# Mark me up! XML: the Next Generation
## 
### JEFFREY TAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
F.xtensible Markup Language,
or XML, lias been described as a
revolutionary way of storing infor
mation. Perhaps its most revolu
tionary aspect is its simplicity. Al
most anyone who looks at some
simple XML code will understand
what it does.
XML is actually an extension ol
Standard (ienerlized Markup 1 lan
guage, developed in the 1980s to
standardize data formats. But
SCMLs specifications were so
complex that when the Internet
started taking off in the 19905, a
much simpler version, XML, was
developed and then formally re
leased in 1998 In the World Wide
Web Consortium, the body re
sponsible for governing the World
Wide Web.
Described at wvvw.xml.org as "a
markup language lor documents
using structured information,"
XML, like the übiquitous Hyper
text Markup I .anguage, or II I ML,
is a container for holding informa
tion. Both use so-called tags, e.g.
embedding an <hrcf> lag within
the html code of a web page will
created a hyperlink for designated
text, but here the similarities end.
While HTML is mostly a
markup language used for display
ing words and pictures 011 a Web
browser such as Microsoft Internet
Kxplorer or Netscape Navigator,
XMI. is usually not used to visually
display information.
In a nutshell, the relationship
between XML and HTML is
roughly analogous to that be
tween Microsoft Word and Mi
crosoft Kxcel: Word displays in
formation, while Kxcel stores and
organizes information.
I he consortium characterizes
XML as the "universal format Un
structured documents and data on
the Web." I his essentially means
that XML stores information and
organizes data in a common format

so that companies using (he Web
can exchange information simply
and quickly.
For example, if a company needs
a profile of one of its employees and
it needs the employee's name, his 01
her e-mail address and phone num
ber, a snippet of XML code loi ibis
task might look like
"<NAME > | oh 11 Doe </NAM K>
<KM AI L> johndoe(f/ b2b.com
</EMAIL> <PHONE>7-
5555</PHONE>." It's simple,
readable and highly portable. Be
cause of these advantages, numerous
multi-billion-dollar corporal i< >ns use
XML to do business transactions
with each other.
Structurally, XML simply has
custom tags, while HTML uses
prc-sct "tags." which usualh comes
in the format of
"<tag>text</tag>." In II I ML, to
create a Web site that displa\s a
blank page with only a name in
bold on it, a code snippet in it
would look like, "<b>|ohn Doe
</b>."
HTML uses about 20 pre-de
fined tags to display and manipu
late text and pictures, while, in
XML, users can c reate am tag to
store virtually any type of informa
tion. For example, to store the
names and age of four students,
you would c reate two tags — one
for storing names and one for stor
ing ages. Ihe resulting XML snip
pet of information on one ol the
students would then look like (his:
"<NAMK>Studcnt A </NAMI >
<AGE>HX/AGE>."
XML can also be used in real
life. If company A in one industry
wanted to do business with compa
ny Bin another industry, they
could contract out a company that
specializes in business to business
solutions to set up software to read
and exchange XML documents
over the Internet between the two
companies. I lien, voila, conipam
A can now send sales orders to
company B using XML and com
pany B can respond in an efficient

<iikl timeh manner.
Willi Inisincss-to-biisiness trans
actions on the Internet increasing

been hailed as a solution to the
problem of coming up with a com
mon lorm.it to conduct these trans
actions.
|on Wu, a junior majoring in
electrical engineering, has al
read\ realized the benefits ol
using XML. When he worked at
Yodlee, .111 Internet startup that
specializes in gathering people's
personal information and then
organizing it lor them, VVII saw
XML at work firsthand, as much
ol this information is stored in

XML format.
XML has helped power the
business-to-business sector ol the
Internet revolution todav, but be
cause XML is so malleable, its ap
plicability has extended beyond
the realm of business-to-business.
For example, major media pub
lishing businesses such as Reuters
now use XML as a way of storing
and organizing articles.
Using XML benefits .1 news or
ganization in two primarx wavs.
First, news editors and reporters
can easily share information with
each other and have access to it
using a common format. Secondly,
once news articles are reach for 011-

line publishing, web sites will be
able to a< cess and navigate articles
with ease because they are all neat
ly organized in XML data format.
So. even though XML is not used
to directl\ display visual data like
11 I'ML, it does help because it or
ganizes the information first so
that a Web site w ill be able to access
its data in a lucid and systematic
manner.

names and age of four students,
you would c reate two tags — one
for storing names and one for stor
ing ages. Ihe resulting XML snip
pet of information on one ol the
students would then look like (his:
"<NAMK>Studcnt A </NAMI >
<AGE>HX/AGE>."
XML can also be used in real
life. If company A in one industry
wanted to do business with compa
ny Bin another industry, they
could contract out a company that
specializes in business to business
solutions to set up software to read
and exchange XML documents
over the Internet between the two
companies. I lien, voila, conipam
A can now send sales orders to
company B using XML and com
pany B can respond in an efficient

<iikl timeh manner.
Willi Inisincss-to-biisiness trans
actions on the Internet increasing
e\|)onentiall\ each year, XML lias
been hailed as a solution to the
problem of coming up with a com

actions.
|on Wu, a junior majoring in
electrical engineering, has al
read\ realized the benefits ol
using XML. When he worked at
Yodlee, .111 Internet startup that
specializes in gathering people's
personal information and then
organizing it lor them, VVII saw
XML at work firsthand, as much
ol this information is stored in

XML format.
XML has helped power the
business-to-business sector ol the
Internet revolution todav, but be
cause XML is so malleable, its ap
plicability has extended beyond
the realm of business-to-business.
For example, major media pub
lishing businesses such as Reuters
now use XML as a way of storing
and organizing articles.
Using XML benefits .1 news or
ganization in two primarx wavs.
First, news editors and reporters
can easily share information with
each other and have access to it
using a common format. Secondly,
once news articles are reach for 011-

line publishing, web sites will be
able to a< cess and navigate articles
with ease because they are all neat
ly organized in XML data format.
So. even though XML is not used
to directl\ display visual data like
11 I'ML, it does help because it or
ganizes the information first so
that a Web site w ill be able to access
its data in a lucid and systematic
manner.
Asked about how the XML
standard has affected business
transactions today, Wu said sim
ply, "It's created a standard way
ol sharing information and pro
vides a simple framework for
doing it."
