Stanlbrd announced yesterday that it will
set aside its open spaces from development
lot 25 years, bringing the University one
step (loser to agreement with environmen
talists, neighboring communities and stu
dent groups concerned about future devel
opment of the Foothills.
"In the spirit of compromise, we can ac -
cept, as an outer limit, the . . . proposal of 25
years for an academic growth boundary,"
Director of (lovernment and Community
Relations Larrv Norton told the Palo Alto
Daily News.
The boundary would follow |unipero
Sen a Boulevard and prevent Stanford from
adding new buildings to the Foothills lor .it
least 25 years.
But even a quarter-century of'protection
tails short of the permanent preservation
demanded b\ environmental groups such
as the Stanford Open Space Alliance. Al
liance spokesman IVter Drekmeicr affirmed
to the Palo Alto Daily News that 25 years
would be inadequate.
Yesterday's announcement arrived on
the eve of a pivotal public hearing tonight in
