step (loser to agreement with environmen
talists, neighboring communities and stu
dent groups concerned about future devel
opment of the Foothills.
"In the spirit of compromise, we can ac -
cept, as an outer limit, the . . . proposal of 25
years for an academic growth boundary,"
Director of (lovernment and Community
Relations Larrv Norton told the Palo Alto
Daily News.
The boundary would follow |unipero
Sen a Boulevard and prevent Stanford from
adding new buildings to the Foothills lor .it

tails short of the permanent preservation

as the Stanford Open Space Alliance. Al
liance spokesman IVter Drekmeicr affirmed
to the Palo Alto Daily News that 25 years
would be inadequate.
