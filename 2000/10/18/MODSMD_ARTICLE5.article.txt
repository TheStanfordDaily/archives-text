The hone marrow-typing drive is target
ed at new students because thc\ haven't had

"Our goals are actually pretty modest,"

"We're expec ting around 300 students to be
t\ped, which is over half'of the over 500 stu
dents of the undergraduate population that
identified themselves as Asian."
I he drive is spec ifically targeted at mi
norities because there are very few Asian
donors registered in the national database,
flic lack of Asian donors was one reason
that the Asian American Donor Program
was created in 1989. At t hat time, there were

The minority blood marrow drive is es
pecially important to the Stanford I .ambcla
c hapter because I van Chen, one of its for
mer mcmljers, died of leukemia in 1990.
At the typing drive, registered nurses will
take two tablespoons of blood from prospec -
tive donors in order to determine their
Human Ixnikocyte Antigen type. No mar
row will ac tually be taken at this time. Stu
dents will also fill out paperwork so they can
be contacted if needed.
After the drive, the antigen types are en
tered into a national database, which is as

sociated with the National Marrow Donot
Program. If patients need a bone marrow
transplant, they can look fora mate li in this
database.
If a match occurs, the prospective donor
will be contac ted to find out il he is still in
terested in donating. At that point, the
donor can dec ide if he wanst to donate mar
row. Should lie dec ide to donate in.mow.
