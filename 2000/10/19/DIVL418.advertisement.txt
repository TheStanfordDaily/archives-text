Centennial, the Poem:
Stanford's "Lost" Centennial Poem
Discovered In Fleeting Rhyme,
The New Book Of Verse
By Stanford Alum Bob Simon
As Stanford geared up to
celebrate its first century, a call
went out for poems and songs
to help commemorate this
"young" University's remarkable
years. One poem that had been
submitted would forever be
remembered as the poem of the
first century of Stanford:
Centennial, the Poem. During
the 1991 centennial celebration,
another Stanford Alum and
master of ceremonies, Ted
Koppel, intoned "In your
program you'll find a poem by
Bob Simon." The last four lines
were then read aloud. Bob
Simon is a San Franciscan by
birth. He majored in economics at
Stanford, where he later
received his MBA. For most of
his adult life he has been a
university development officer.
