Travel smart.
Carry American Express Travelers Cheques.
They're safer than cash.
Whether you're surfing Baja, backpacking Europe, or just getting away for the
weekend, American Express Travelers Cheques are the way to go. They're accepted
virtually everywhere around the world — at hotels, stores, and restaurants. Simply
sign the Cheques and use them as you would cash.
American Express Travelers Cheques never expire. And if they're lost or stolen, they
can be replaced quickly — usually within 24 hours. Pick them up at any participating
American Express Travel Service location, bank, credit union, or AAA office.
