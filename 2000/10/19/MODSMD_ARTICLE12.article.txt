1983
On October 19, 1983, The Daily pub
lished an article titled, "Trying to end mail
hassles."
"University administrators are currently
meeting with post oHice personnel to line!
ways to alleviate the long lines at the cam
pus station which one clerk described as
the longest ever.. ..
"The post ollice has made several sug
gestions to University planning officials
which they hope will create more space
and less crowds in tlit* present facility. Ac
cording to Assistant Director ol Facilities
and Services John Albrecht, post office olli
cials have suggested having mail sorted at
the main post ollice on hast Bayshore
Drive instead ol in the campus facility
where it is currently sorted. . . .
" '1 think we're closer to a solution now
than we were when we started a couple of
years ago,' said Albrecht. I hope we have
some changes this year.'
Bottom Line: Seventeen years later, their
prayers fora new, efficient post office system
are answered.
