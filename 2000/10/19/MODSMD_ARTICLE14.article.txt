freedom's challenge."

and their own dreams." (llinton
said. "In the names and faces of
those we lost and mourn, the
world sees our nation's greatest
strength: People in uniform, root
ed in every race, creed and region
on the lace of the Earth."

the bombing. "()ur search for you
will be relentless."
Army Oen. Hugh Shelton,

our reach, longer."
