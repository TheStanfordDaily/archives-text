WASHINGTON (AP) — The Sen
ale gave Imal congressional approval
yesterdav to a bill modest.lv easing the
trade embargo on Cuba and providing
$'Ui billion in disaster assistance and
other election-year aid to farmers.
President (llinton has agreed to sign
the $78 billion agricultural spending
bill, which also will allow the import ot
U.S.-made prescription drugs that are
sold more cheaply abroad.
The bill, which the Senate
approved <S(>-<X, would allow sales of
food to Cuba for the first time in lour
decades, Inn the move is largely sym
bolic, because ii bars the federal gov
ernment or U.S. banks from financing
the shipments.
Farm groups that are eager to trade
with Cuba say the legislation is ,i start.
"I lopefullv, it will be a step toward a
broader opening," said Sen. I im
Hutchinson, an Arkansas Republican
whose state's farmers hope to sell rid
to Cuba.
But even .is the Senate was prepar
ing the vole on the bill, hundreds of
thousands of Cubans marched in
Havana in protest of the legislation,
l he Communist Parly daily Crannia
(ailed the bill a "gross lie that the geno
cidal blockade has been softened."
Democrats called lhe Cuba measure
.1 "step backward," both because of the
financial limits and because it would
bar President Clinton or his successor
from easing restrictions on travel to
Cuba.
"The hard-liners won out on the

Cuba issue," said Sen. Bvron Dorgan,
D-N.l). "Win should farmers not have
access to thai market in Cuba."
Republican Sen. Pal Roberts of
Kansas conceded that the bill was
unlikely to result in many sales.
The legislation also aims to increase
sales of food and medicine to Iran,
Libya, Norih Korea and Sudan by
allowing U.S. subsidies for such
exports.
Democrats also criticized the bill's
drug-import provision, contending ii
was so full of loopholes that it would
result in little savings to consumers.
But Sen. |ames Jeffords, a Vermont
Republican who has championed the
issue, said he thought the legislation
was "strong and workable," even belter
than an earlier version that Democrats
supported.
Among the provisions ol the agricul
ture spending bill:
— Some $2 billion in aid to farmers
who have lost crops or pasture to
drought diis year, l he bill also pro
vides subsidies to honey producers,
whose government price-support pro
gram was phased out in the 19905.

testing for salmonella bacteria about
