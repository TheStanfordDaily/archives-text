moved in and helped the market recover
most ol its losses.
Investor despair over a generally bleak
earnings outlook and a huge decline in
IBM sent the Dow below 10,000 lor the
first time since March I 4.
I he Dow c losed at 9,075.02, down
I 14.00, after an earlier drop of more than
l.'W points had sent the blue chip index to
its lowest intradav trading level since
March 24, 1999.
I he Nasdaq composite index lell 42.40
to 3, 171 .. r >f>. bobbing in and out of positive
territory after rebounding from a nearly
INN-point slide in the lirst hour.
"I think we are near the bottom, but this
is a bottom that's going to need some cred
ibility," said Brian Belski, a fundamental
market strategist at U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaflray.
He said bargain hunting, not any reso
lution of market problems, was responsible
for the upturn.
"()il is still high, the euro is down and
the Middle East is still in a potentially
explosive situation," said Bill Barker, an
investment strategy consultant with Daiti
Rauscher. The fundamentals haven't
changed, he said.
Investors in search of cheap tech slocks
appeared to be responsible lor the mar
ket's recovery. Intel, which reported earn
ings in line with analyst estimates late

I uesday, rose $2, or about 5 percent, to
$38.19. I he chip maker had fallen about
50 percent in two months.

though.

inflation compounded the selloff.
"You've got evidence now that the dis
appointing earnings picture is a general
ized event and not company-specific." said
Robert J. Barbera, cliiel economist at

on that some inflation news that says it's
hard to argue the Fed will imminently
come to the rescue."
J. 1\ Morgan's results beat Wall Street
expectations, but investors punished it
anyway because of its planned merger with
Chase Manhattan, which reported disap
pointing earnings. Morgan plunged in the
morning to $118. but had recovered b\
late afternoon and was off $4.50 .it
$133.13. Chase slipped $1.13 to $36.18.
