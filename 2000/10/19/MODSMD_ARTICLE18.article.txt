## The
						Stanford Daily Don't let Axess 2000 spoil 'shopping period'

Published Since IS 1 )1

WHEN THE NEW Axess 2000 sys
tem is fully in place, it seems as
though Stanford will be well on its
way to preregistration — a step
that will ultimately be detrimental to students.
Granted, the new system will make many
unheard-of services a reality. These include
reapplying for financial aid or submitting appli
cations for graduate school online.
The new Axess system, which is designed to
handle the more than 1 ()(),()()() inquiries and
40,000 transcript requests it receives a day, more
efficiently than the current system, should be
complete by 2004.
University officials and faculty are also inter
ested in another possible feature of Axess 2000:
pre-regist ration.
According to University Registrar Roger
Printup, students would be able to register for
classes weeks before the following quarter

begins. Printup believes that preregistration
would give departments more notice in order
ing books and hiring teaching assistants, thus
making the first weeks of the quarter easier for
professors.
While the idea of easing the stress of the
"shopping period" sounds great to administra
tors and professors, the idea of preregistration
strikes fear into the hearts of many Stanford
students.
We cling to the idea of being able to visit sev
eral classes in the two-week period before official
registration. Instead of being bound to a selec -
tion made weeks before classes begin, Stanford
students can jump from (lass to class fora few
days, finding the schedule that lits them best.
It's an ingenious idea and may plav a role in
attracting many prospective students.
I he shopping period brings some degree of
annovance to professors; after all, no one enjovs

watching people come in and out of class in the
middle of an important lecture. But generally,
the shopping period is a small and accepted part
of the academic quarter. Most students are too
(earful of falling behind in class to even enjoy
the shopping period to its full extent.
While we sympathize with the problems
professors face during the shopping period —
inadequate lecture space and frequent short
ages of course materials — these problems do
not warrant full abandonment of the current
system.
Printup has suggested that pre-registration
would not limit the shopping period or change
drop or add dates. Inevitably, however, pre-reg
istation would fundamentally change the
nature of Stanford's academic quarter. Profes
sors may choose to require ( lass attendance
even in the first week and be less sympathetic to
students who enroll in class after the start of the

quarter.
And pity the poor freshmen who, even before
arriving at the Farm and meeting with their
advisors, would be asked to choose their first col
lege courses.
On top of all of this, students will have to
decide, while still working through one quarter,
what they would like to take in the next.
Preregistration is still in the discussion phase,
but we implore the Committee on Undergradu
ate Studies and the Committee for Academic
Appraisal and Achievement to consider other
options.
Departments could send out interest forms to
students to gauge the number of students inter
ested in a class. Sign-ups sheets seem to work
well for smaller classes. Professors should note
previous class numbers to attempt to plan for
the number of students in future classes.
Preregistration is not the answer.
