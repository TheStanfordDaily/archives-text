# SUMMARY JUDGMENT
## Olympic triumph in Sydney 
### 
The recent Olympic Games in
Sydney were remarkable, not
just because of how good Stan
lord athletes looked there, but
because of how bad the Games made the
1996 Atlanta Olympics look.
While the United States flopped miser
ably at hosting the Games, Australia set a
high standard for any city to match. In
fact, we might have the 2004 Olympics
back at Sydney rather than at ill-prepared
Athens.

ni 11%. i la.
At the close of the
2000 Summer
Olympics, Juan Anto
nio Samaranch, presi
dent of the Interna
tional Olympic Com
mittee, complimented
Sydney for hosting
"the best games ever."
While many specta-

/ I
tors would agree, this is actually the acco
lade traditionally handed out to every
hosting city at closing ceremonies. The
only time the lOC president did not give
this complement was at the 1996 Atlanta
Games.
Withholding this tribute was a ship in
the face for Atlanta, which had beaten out
Athens to host the Centennial Olympics.
The Olympics officially began in Athens
in 1890. Atlanta's only excuse was that the
modern Olympics were becoming too
huge and unwieldy to be manageable.
This is not surprising, given the now 200
countries sending 13,500 athletes.
Throw in a few hundred thousand
spectators, media observers and T-shirt
hawkers and you have a mess few c ities
could handle. Even back in 1976, Mon
treal nearly went bankrupt hosting the
Olympics.
But like those Olympic gymnasts,
Sydney made it all look easy. In part, it
was due to smart planning. Security was
the biggest concern — the pipe bombing
in Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park
killed a woman and injured more than
100 others.
Learning from Atlanta's mistakes, Syd
ney locked down the Olympic park with
metal detectors and over 2,300 hidden
cameras watching for trouble.
Police work before the Games helped
prevent potential trouble. In May, police
arrested a man with a Nazi fixation after

finding explosive materials in his home
near the Olympic site. New Zealand
police may have prevented a terrorist
attack on a nuclear research reactor in
Sydney.
Iti addition to making ilic Olympics
safer, Sydney's organizers made the event
more enjoyable. 1 hey separated the com
petition facilities from the entertainment
areas and enlisted more than 47,000
cheerful Aussie volunteers to ease trallic.
I'nlike the terrible transportation sys
tem at Atlanta. Sydney's system got the
athletes and spectators to events on time.
While Atlanta's venue was plopped in the
heart of slum-like Suinmerhill, Sydney's
facilities overlooked the stunningly scenic
Homebush Bay. Another interesting dif
ference was the distribution of 100.000
free condoms to Olvmpic athletes during
their two-week stay.
Even the event's biggest scandal —
widespread doping among athletes —
was actually a result of Sydney's careful
planning. After rampant use of steroids at
the Atlanta Games — which athletes
called "the human-growth-hortnone
Games" — Olympic officials in Sydney
extensively conduc ted random blood and
m ine tests.
As a result, several athletes turned up
positive, besmearing the reputation of the
2000 Olympics, but proving that Sydney
was proac tivclv tackling the issue.
Despite doping problems that will
remain endemic in future (Mympics, Syd
ney proves that a well-prepared c ity can
still handle the Olympics. The question is
now whether future cities will be able to
reach that bar.
Beijing, a strong contender for the
2008 Olympics host, is already building
stadiums and other infrastructure. On
the other hand, Athens, the 2004
Olympic host, is behind schedule with a
third of its facilities yet to be built.
Concern is growing within the lOC
that Athens won't get its act together in
time, and a London paper reported that
Sydney has been put on standby for re
hosting, just in c ase.
Considering Sydney's performance
this year, a repeat of the Down Under
Games would be a treat.
