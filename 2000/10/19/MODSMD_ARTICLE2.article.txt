### NICHOLAS CHAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On ()ct. 9. the Santa Clara County Planning Com
mission released a stall report recommending that
Stanford build more housing, respec t undeveloped
land and heed the regional impact of any new Uni
versity development.
The Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors will
consider the Planning Commission's report when it
votes on Stanford's permit later this month.
1 lit- report is not binding on the Board, but it re
flects the planning commission's view of how Stanford
should use its land.
1 he commission's recommendations focus on the
environmental and regional efleets of Stanford's new
development. They also suggest that Stanford build
new housing in conjunc tion with its present and fu
ture development.
Stanford has already agreed to some suggestions in
the report, such as 25 years of open space preservation
in the Foothills and building housing on the site of the
driving range.
Housing was an especially important issue in the
report, taking up five of its 23 pages. The report sug
gested that Stanford build new housing in conjunc
tion with future academic development, a policy
known as linkage.
I he c ommissioners also recommended specific
sites, such as Escondido Village, on which Stanford
should concentrate additional housing because of
environmental and traffic concerns.
The report also endorsed a policy of "no net
new commute trips" for the campus, meaning that
all population increases would have to be coupled
with an increase in on-campus housing or public
transportation.
An environmental impact section said that some
aspects of Stanford's new development raise signifi
cant environmental problems. The development
could potentially harm the California tiger salaman
der and destroy open space in the Foothills.
These considerations might require the Universi
ty to modih its plan, the report said.
The report contained a summary of public com
ments on Stanford's future development. Some
community members suggested changes including
the creation of a community resource group and
several new policies to promote and facilitate new
housing development.
1 he committee suggested in the report that as long
as St an lord can lessen its impact on the environment
and follow the county's rules, it can continue to follow
a policy of "flexibility with accountability."
Director of Community and Government Rela
tions Lam 1 lorton said in a press release,"We believe
that a more flexible Academic Growth Boundary, pe
riodically reviewable as provided in the County's gen
eral plan for Urban Growth Boundaries, is a sound,
prac tical planning tool to ensure wise public policy."
Meetings will be held Oct. 30 and 31 in Palo Alto for
the Board of Supervisors to debate and vote on the
permit.
