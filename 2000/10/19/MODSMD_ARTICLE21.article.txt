Daily should look at its own
'corporate focus'
1 hose of us w ho refuse (or simply can
not) suck tlie golden nipples ol corpo
ratism read with reliel I he Daily's edito
rial yesterday ("Corporate locus
onstrained Career Fair").
Having reached an enviable yet pre
carious apex in the mid and late 19905,
Stanford now begins slowlv but inevitablv
a course down the spiral.
Don't count on donations, gifts, high
profile* visitors and sports publicity. Once
a pattern of discontent, doubt and soul
searching has been established, the
course cannot be reversed without adopt
ing radical solutions.
So I read the editorial as part of a
question mark growing day by day over
Stanford. A splash of self-criticism, how
ever, would not undermine the editorial's
commitment to human values (arguably
the most endangered species in the
world).
As a regular reader of The Daily, 1
have perceived, in the last four years, a
remarkable increase in the frequency and
intensity of corporate presence in its
pages.
I will leave aside the glowing reports
on start-ups. The worst kind of this infil
tration are the whole-page display ads,
where the corporate dragon miraculous
ly disappears in the sublimity of empty
space and /en aphorisms. (Since when
does joining a company lead to Enlight
enment?)

And just a few months ago, I also
raised the problem of featuring ads that
directly exploit pre-graduation anxiety.
It would be a service to us who
applauded yesterday's editorial, if 1 lie
Daily would at least acknowledge the
problem of corporate infiltration in its
own home. Ii is neither a crime nor
humiliation to sav things as they are. Just
common sense.

Chappie editor clarifies argument
In regards to the criticism of my letter
on Monday ("Chappie editor defends
special fees," Oct. 1(>), 1 have a short
response: I he author was absolutely cor
rect. My letter comprised a series of irra
tional, «id hominem attacks; they did not
even remotely resemble a sound argu
ment.
Kut that was the point.
Do I really believe there is the least
inferential connection between anti-spe
cial tee sentiment and racism or homo
phobia? Of course not. Do I really believe
that The Review is classist? Clearly not.
But, did I believe that my words —
rhetorically overblown and uncon
scionably calumnious — would be taken
at face value? Obviously not.
My invectives were outlandish; they
were designed to amuse and provoke, not
to support the thrust of my sincere belief

that exhorting students to refund special
fee is, in some sense, irresponsible.
So now, at this point, 1 am inclined to
rill a little on the objectivism that blinded
the letter's author to my mischevious and
irreverent intent — that Ayn Rand
wouldn't know what a joke was il it bit her
on the face, or that Reaganite conserva
tives are so self-absorbed that the very
idea of treating themselves with a little
levity is terrifying. But that would be an
ad hominem attack, and il might, (iod
forbid, be funny. And we certainly can't
have that, can we?

University should allow faculty leave
I think that it is admirable that the
university permitted Prof. Tom Cam
bell a leave of absence in order to pur
sue another career. Many, many
people in today's workforce are able to
change careers multiple times, some
thing that is probably not only enjoy
able but also greatly beneficial to one's
perspective.
Much of academia is concerned with
knowledge that is based at least partially
upon events in the outside world. Con
versely, the knowledge produced by
academia should be used to further the
Male of the outside world. So ii is curious
that 1 Ik* Daily should not want a law pro
lessor 10 learn about the creation of law
firsthand, or to appl\ his knowledge and
beliefs to further a nation.
1 here is a second reason that leaves
of absence should be generous; it is in
the University's best interests that many
qualified people should want to be pro
lessors at Stanford. Most other careers
would allow a candidate to try out
another second career lor awhile and to
then return.
Upon their return, the candidate
might be set back a bit in their original
career, but not overwhelmingly so.
I Inder a strict interpretation of tenure, a
professor would not have that freedom.
Such a polity would weed out from the
beginning main potential professors who
t raved a variety of perspectives on lile or
who weren't certain that the) knew what
they would want twenty years down the
line.
Almost as bad loi the school, said can
didates might avoid Stanford and work at
another school with a friendlier tenure
policy.

Leave politics out of Foothill plan
Stanford development plans generally
have strings attached and those strings
often lead to . . . more development.
A current example is the offer ol the
Maylield School site for the JCC in
exchange lor 1 million square leel of
commercial expansion in the Industrial
Park.
llie permanent preservation and
community access to the Stanford
Foothills should be a noble legat \ and an
exception to this tradition of quid pro
quo.
Stanford's plans, both those currently
public and those yet 1 1> be revealed,
should incorporate the visual and virtual
benefits of permanent and publicly at ces
sible local open spat e, with no caveats, as
a gesture to the community, which will be
allot ted negatively in many ways by the
increased traffic and new construction.
I am grateful to Stanford loi the tradi
tion ol public access to the Foothills and
ask that Stanford permanently allow light
footsteps on the Foothills as well .is on the
paved road.

University should plan carefully for
future growth
I support the tore strategies and goals
of the Stanford Community Plan, which
are:
Strategy #1 — Promote compact
development and conservation of natural
resources through use ol an Academic
(? row ill Boundary;
Strategy #2 — Maintain co-operative
planning agreements and implementa
tion;
Strategy #.'J— Mitigate and monitor
the impacts of growth.
However, 1 am deeply concerned that
the polities in the Community Plan are
not strong enough to ensure that these
goals will be achieved. I lie implementa
tion measures of the plan must be
strengthened.
I'lie Community Plan mentions open
space and habitat preservation as one ol
its primary goals, vet it would allow devel
opment on the most valuable California
tiger salamander habitat, potentially
destroy ing almost half of the habitat iden
tified in the 11)98 California tiger sala
mander management agreement.
I liis plan has the potential to cause the
California tiger salamander to go locally
extinct In reiving on unproven mitigation
measures and creation of new habitat that
nia\ not be suitable.
I could support additional develop
ment of the core campus only if it is con
ditioned upon phased permanent dedica
tion of important open spat e areas.
F very increment ol development
should have a corresponding reasonable
increment of permanent open-space
preservation. 11l is plan provides no per
manent protection.
Please consider the following four
points.
1) An enhanced development overlay
should be established over the area with
in the academic growth boundary, per
mitting additional academic development
t)iil\ if it is concurrent with phased per
manent dedication of identified open
space lands.
An Atademit Crowth Boundary is not
a preservation tool and should not be
substituted lor one.
2) All sensitive habitats should be pro
tected permanently — including those on
the core campus. I liese areas should be
included in the early dedications of the
enhanced development overlay.
Special conservation areas need to be
expanded.
No development should occur in sen
sitive habitat, specifically within the tiger
salamander management /.one, wetland
areas or dispersal habitats of the Califor
nia red-legged Irog. Identification of
existing habitat /.ones still needs to hap
pen in accordance with the I '.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service's Recovery Plan lor the

California red-legged l'rog.
The golf course should be left intact,
with no development on hole number
one or on the driving range — this corri
dor provides an important habitat link
age lot the California tiger salamander
between Lake Lagunita and the 18 acres
of old-growth oak woodland in the mid
dle of the golf course.
'M l he urban limit line (the boundary
between the "Academic Campus" and
"Academic Reserve and ()pen Space")
should not be enlarged.
No facts have been submitted to
explain why ii is justified to place new
urban development beyond the existing
urban limit line. The urban limit line
should onlv be moved to protect impor
tant habitat, making it consistent with
County Ceneral Plan policy C-CI) 21:
"Long term urban growth boundaries
should not include . . . important natural
resource areas."
Vital habitat lot the California tiger
salamander is inside the proposed Aca
demic Crowth Boundary and slotted for
development. It is essential that existing
habitat identified in the California tiger
salamander management agreement be
preserved to prevent the species from
going locally extinct. I he land-use desig
nation of (lampus ()pen Space is not ade
quate to protect this important habitat.
The 25-year Academic Crowth
Boundary proposed bv the stall is porous,
establishing no mechanisms to slow
growth, but t ather allowing the boundary
to be moved when the campus reaches
the "trigger" of million square feet.
1 his level of growth is likely to be
reached in the next 15 years at current
growth t ales. Indeed, this "trigger" could
be perceived as an incentive to speed
growth. Phased dedication of open space
would provide an incentive to slow
growth and create mote efficient devel
opment patterns on the core campus.
•4) The County's Community Plan
should create incentives lor redevelop
ment of the core campus. This should
include the transformation of existing
surface parking into multi-leveled struc
tured parking, redevelopment and inten
sification of the many underutili/ed areas
on the cote campus and required intensi
fication of any new development.

Protect the Foothills
I am a resident of Palo Alio and a
graduate of Stanford University, ( lass of
'60, MBA '62. In my opinion, Stanford's
position on its proposed Ceneral I se
Permit and Community Plan has
improved over the last few weeks, but is
still unsatisfactory.
Flie environment and quality of life in

and around Stanford and Palo Alto has
steadilv declined as a result of the devel
opment that lias occurred over the last 40
years.
It is time to act boldly to ensure no fiir
ther deterioration occurs. Our commit
ment to ourselves, our c hildren and our
grandchildren should be an environment
and qualitv of life that is better than what
it is today. Permanent protection of the
Foothills is a major step in this direction.
I urge the Stanford community, the
Palo Alto Citv Council and the Santa

please ac i boldly and take a strong stand
in favor of permanent protection of the

Teach-in was not misbilled
1 am writing this letter to ask you to re
think your statement in 1 uesday's edito
rial ("History department teach-in was
misbilled," ()(i. 17), which I found offen
sive to both the History Department and
to the large number of Muslims, Arabs
and other sensible and rational people on
this campus, regardless of their faith and
ethnic 'it v. I his includes scores of Jews and
Christians who oppose the oppressive
regime of the Zionist government.
A teach-in about a c risis is supposed to
give facts and to discuss the when, what,
who and win aspects of any action that
led to that c risis. It is not supposed to be
defending one party or the other. In that
respect, I Ibund that the teach-in did pro
vide the adequate information and was
correctlv put in its perspective by the I lis
tory Department and the two professors
who presented it.
For the record, the Muslim students
on campus were told after the teach-in
ili.it "pro-Zionist" speakers were sought
lor the event and none of them agreed.
My guess is that 11 icy could not rise up to
the challenge and face the audience hav
ing nothing to support theii views in the
current situation.
Unfortunately, readers in this country
are usually facing editorials concerning
the Middle Last similar to yours that have
no information and thai promote con
cepts like equality hi it without much sub
stance or analysis to justify what they arc
saving.
l he point is, I see your editorial as a
tactless piece of writing. On the other
hand. I commend Prof. Beinin for pre
senting the historical facts that led to the
current conflict, knowing that the Zionist
students will attack him in person as they
did.
Freedom-lighters like the Palestinians
and their supporters always come under
attack from the oppresive forces. 1 also
praise Prof. Moosa for presenting the

Muslim perspective on Jerusalem.
Finally, I encourage Prof. Roberts and
the History Department in general to
facilitate more forums like this one to
really educate students and not just to
promote empty slogans as others do.

University is doing its best to protect its
interests — our interests
Your editorial, "Promises Come Too
Close to Manipulation," is both wrong
headed and misinformed.
You sav that "Stanford's offer of land
for the Jewish Community Center is con
tingent upon approval of the General Use
Permit and Community plan it submitted
to Santa Clara County."
But in fact the offer is contingent upon
approval of a General Use Plan that is
acceptable to the University. As Larry
Morton, director of government and
community relations, has said, the Uni
versity "fully anticipates having a satisfac
tory use permit. Acceptable doesn't mean
it has to have everything we wanted."
I fas it not occured to you that the pro
cess In which an application for such a
plan gets adopted is inevitably a political
process? I o stigmatize it In saying "The
arrangement reeks of backroom politics"
is merely empty rhetoric.
The interests that Stanford is defend
ing in this process are to no small degree
your interests — the interests of Stanford
students, now and in the future. The Uni
versity wants to build housing for both its
people (students, faculty and staff) and
activities (teaching and research). Doing
so requires the enactment by the Board ol
Supervisors of a satisfactory General Use
Plan. That is why the officers of ASSU
and of graduate student organizations
have been vocal supporters of the Uni
versity's plans. Given all this, why does
the campus newspaper choose to see
things so perversely?

So I read the editorial as part of a
question mark growing day by day over
Stanford. A splash of self-criticism, how
ever, would not undermine the editorial's
commitment to human values (arguably
the most endangered species in the
world).
As a regular reader of The Daily, 1
have perceived, in the last four years, a
remarkable increase in the frequency and
intensity of corporate presence in its
pages.
I will leave aside the glowing reports

where the corporate dragon miraculous
ly disappears in the sublimity of empty
space and /en aphorisms. (Since when
does joining a company lead to Enlight
enment?)

And just a few months ago, I also
raised the problem of featuring ads that
directly exploit pre-graduation anxiety.
It would be a service to us who
applauded yesterday's editorial, if 1 lie
Daily would at least acknowledge the
problem of corporate infiltration in its
own home. Ii is neither a crime nor

Chappie editor clarifies argument
In regards to the criticism of my letter
on Monday ("Chappie editor defends
special fees," Oct. 1(>), 1 have a short
response: I he author was absolutely cor
rect. My letter comprised a series of irra
tional, «id hominem attacks; they did not
even remotely resemble a sound argu
ment.
Kut that was the point.
Do I really believe there is the least
inferential connection between anti-spe
cial tee sentiment and racism or homo
phobia? Of course not. Do I really believe
that The Review is classist? Clearly not.
But, did I believe that my words —
rhetorically overblown and uncon
scionably calumnious — would be taken
at face value? Obviously not.
My invectives were outlandish; they
were designed to amuse and provoke, not
to support the thrust of my sincere belief

that exhorting students to refund special
fee is, in some sense, irresponsible.
So now, at this point, 1 am inclined to
rill a little on the objectivism that blinded
the letter's author to my mischevious and
irreverent intent — that Ayn Rand
wouldn't know what a joke was il it bit her
on the face, or that Reaganite conserva
tives are so self-absorbed that the very
idea of treating themselves with a little
levity is terrifying. But that would be an
ad hominem attack, and il might, (iod
forbid, be funny. And we certainly can't
have that, can we?

University should allow faculty leave
I think that it is admirable that the
university permitted Prof. Tom Cam
bell a leave of absence in order to pur
sue another career. Many, many
people in today's workforce are able to
change careers multiple times, some
thing that is probably not only enjoy
able but also greatly beneficial to one's
perspective.
Much of academia is concerned with
knowledge that is based at least partially
upon events in the outside world. Con
versely, the knowledge produced by
academia should be used to further the
Male of the outside world. So ii is curious
that 1 Ik* Daily should not want a law pro
lessor 10 learn about the creation of law
firsthand, or to appl\ his knowledge and
beliefs to further a nation.
1 here is a second reason that leaves
of absence should be generous; it is in
the University's best interests that many
qualified people should want to be pro
lessors at Stanford. Most other careers
would allow a candidate to try out
another second career lor awhile and to
then return.
Upon their return, the candidate
might be set back a bit in their original
career, but not overwhelmingly so.
I Inder a strict interpretation of tenure, a
professor would not have that freedom.
Such a polity would weed out from the
beginning main potential professors who
t raved a variety of perspectives on lile or
who weren't certain that the) knew what
they would want twenty years down the
line.
Almost as bad loi the school, said can
didates might avoid Stanford and work at
another school with a friendlier tenure
policy.

Stanford development plans generally

benefits of permanent and publicly at ces
sible local open spat e, with no caveats, as
a gesture to the community, which will be
allot ted negatively in many ways by the
increased traffic and new construction.
I am grateful to Stanford loi the tradi

University should plan carefully for
future growth
I support the tore strategies and goals
of the Stanford Community Plan, which
are:
Strategy #1 — Promote compact
development and conservation of natural
resources through use ol an Academic
(? row ill Boundary;
Strategy #2 — Maintain co-operative
planning agreements and implementa
tion;
Strategy #.'J— Mitigate and monitor
the impacts of growth.
However, 1 am deeply concerned that
the polities in the Community Plan are
not strong enough to ensure that these
goals will be achieved. I lie implementa
tion measures of the plan must be
strengthened.
I'lie Community Plan mentions open
space and habitat preservation as one ol
its primary goals, vet it would allow devel
opment on the most valuable California
tiger salamander habitat, potentially
destroy ing almost half of the habitat iden
tified in the 11)98 California tiger sala
mander management agreement.
I liis plan has the potential to cause the
California tiger salamander to go locally
extinct In reiving on unproven mitigation
measures and creation of new habitat that
nia\ not be suitable.
I could support additional develop
ment of the core campus only if it is con
ditioned upon phased permanent dedica
tion of important open spat e areas.
F very increment ol development
should have a corresponding reasonable
increment of permanent open-space
preservation. 11l is plan provides no per
manent protection.
Please consider the following four
points.
1) An enhanced development overlay
should be established over the area with
in the academic growth boundary, per
mitting additional academic development
t)iil\ if it is concurrent with phased per
manent dedication of identified open
space lands.
An Atademit Crowth Boundary is not
a preservation tool and should not be
substituted lor one.
2) All sensitive habitats should be pro
tected permanently — including those on
the core campus. I liese areas should be
included in the early dedications of the
enhanced development overlay.
Special conservation areas need to be
expanded.
No development should occur in sen
sitive habitat, specifically within the tiger
salamander management /.one, wetland
areas or dispersal habitats of the Califor
nia red-legged Irog. Identification of
existing habitat /.ones still needs to hap
pen in accordance with the I '.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service's Recovery Plan lor the

California red-legged l'rog.
The golf course should be left intact,
with no development on hole number
one or on the driving range — this corri
dor provides an important habitat link
age lot the California tiger salamander
between Lake Lagunita and the 18 acres
of old-growth oak woodland in the mid
dle of the golf course.
'M l he urban limit line (the boundary
between the "Academic Campus" and
"Academic Reserve and ()pen Space")
should not be enlarged.
No facts have been submitted to
explain why ii is justified to place new
urban development beyond the existing
urban limit line. The urban limit line
should onlv be moved to protect impor
tant habitat, making it consistent with
County Ceneral Plan policy C-CI) 21:
"Long term urban growth boundaries
should not include . . . important natural
resource areas."
Vital habitat lot the California tiger
salamander is inside the proposed Aca
demic Crowth Boundary and slotted for
development. It is essential that existing
habitat identified in the California tiger
salamander management agreement be
preserved to prevent the species from
going locally extinct. I he land-use desig
nation of (lampus ()pen Space is not ade
quate to protect this important habitat.
The 25-year Academic Crowth
Boundary proposed bv the stall is porous,
establishing no mechanisms to slow
growth, but t ather allowing the boundary
to be moved when the campus reaches
the "trigger" of million square feet.
1 his level of growth is likely to be
reached in the next 15 years at current
growth t ales. Indeed, this "trigger" could
be perceived as an incentive to speed
growth. Phased dedication of open space
would provide an incentive to slow
growth and create mote efficient devel
opment patterns on the core campus.
•4) The County's Community Plan
should create incentives lor redevelop
ment of the core campus. This should
include the transformation of existing
surface parking into multi-leveled struc
tured parking, redevelopment and inten
sification of the many underutili/ed areas
on the cote campus and required intensi
fication of any new development.

A teach-in about a c risis is supposed to

Your editorial, "Promises Come Too
Close to Manipulation," is both wrong

You sav that "Stanford's offer of land
for the Jewish Community Center is con
tingent upon approval of the General Use
Permit and Community plan it submitted
to Santa Clara County."
But in fact the offer is contingent upon
approval of a General Use Plan that is
acceptable to the University. As Larry
Morton, director of government and
community relations, has said, the Uni
versity "fully anticipates having a satisfac
tory use permit. Acceptable doesn't mean
it has to have everything we wanted."
I fas it not occured to you that the pro
cess In which an application for such a
plan gets adopted is inevitably a political
process? I o stigmatize it In saying "The
arrangement reeks of backroom politics"
is merely empty rhetoric.
The interests that Stanford is defend
ing in this process are to no small degree
your interests — the interests of Stanford
students, now and in the future. The Uni
versity wants to build housing for both its
people (students, faculty and staff) and
activities (teaching and research). Doing
so requires the enactment by the Board ol
Supervisors of a satisfactory General Use

Chappie editor clarifies argument
In regards to the criticism of my letter
on Monday ("Chappie editor defends
special fees," Oct. 1(>), 1 have a short
response: I he author was absolutely cor
rect. My letter comprised a series of irra
tional, «id hominem attacks; they did not
even remotely resemble a sound argu
ment.
Kut that was the point.
Do I really believe there is the least
inferential connection between anti-spe
cial tee sentiment and racism or homo
phobia? Of course not. Do I really believe
that The Review is classist? Clearly not.
But, did I believe that my words —
rhetorically overblown and uncon
scionably calumnious — would be taken
at face value? Obviously not.
My invectives were outlandish; they
were designed to amuse and provoke, not
to support the thrust of my sincere belief

that exhorting students to refund special
fee is, in some sense, irresponsible.
So now, at this point, 1 am inclined to
rill a little on the objectivism that blinded
the letter's author to my mischevious and
irreverent intent — that Ayn Rand
wouldn't know what a joke was il it bit her
on the face, or that Reaganite conserva
tives are so self-absorbed that the very
idea of treating themselves with a little
levity is terrifying. But that would be an
ad hominem attack, and il might, (iod
forbid, be funny. And we certainly can't
have that, can we?

University should allow faculty leave
I think that it is admirable that the
university permitted Prof. Tom Cam
bell a leave of absence in order to pur
sue another career. Many, many
people in today's workforce are able to
change careers multiple times, some
thing that is probably not only enjoy
able but also greatly beneficial to one's
perspective.
Much of academia is concerned with
knowledge that is based at least partially
upon events in the outside world. Con
versely, the knowledge produced by
academia should be used to further the
Male of the outside world. So ii is curious
that 1 Ik* Daily should not want a law pro
lessor 10 learn about the creation of law
firsthand, or to appl\ his knowledge and
beliefs to further a nation.
1 here is a second reason that leaves
of absence should be generous; it is in
the University's best interests that many
qualified people should want to be pro
lessors at Stanford. Most other careers
would allow a candidate to try out
another second career lor awhile and to
then return.
Upon their return, the candidate
might be set back a bit in their original
career, but not overwhelmingly so.
I Inder a strict interpretation of tenure, a
professor would not have that freedom.
Such a polity would weed out from the
beginning main potential professors who
t raved a variety of perspectives on lile or
who weren't certain that the) knew what
they would want twenty years down the
line.
Almost as bad loi the school, said can
didates might avoid Stanford and work at
another school with a friendlier tenure
policy.

University should plan carefully for
future growth
I support the tore strategies and goals
of the Stanford Community Plan, which
are:
Strategy #1 — Promote compact
development and conservation of natural
resources through use ol an Academic
(? row ill Boundary;
Strategy #2 — Maintain co-operative
planning agreements and implementa
tion;
Strategy #.'J— Mitigate and monitor
the impacts of growth.
However, 1 am deeply concerned that
the polities in the Community Plan are
not strong enough to ensure that these
goals will be achieved. I lie implementa
tion measures of the plan must be
strengthened.
I'lie Community Plan mentions open
space and habitat preservation as one ol
its primary goals, vet it would allow devel
opment on the most valuable California
tiger salamander habitat, potentially
destroy ing almost half of the habitat iden
tified in the 11)98 California tiger sala
mander management agreement.
I liis plan has the potential to cause the
California tiger salamander to go locally
extinct In reiving on unproven mitigation
measures and creation of new habitat that
nia\ not be suitable.
I could support additional develop
ment of the core campus only if it is con
ditioned upon phased permanent dedica
tion of important open spat e areas.
F very increment ol development
should have a corresponding reasonable
increment of permanent open-space
preservation. 11l is plan provides no per
manent protection.
Please consider the following four
points.
1) An enhanced development overlay
should be established over the area with
in the academic growth boundary, per
mitting additional academic development
t)iil\ if it is concurrent with phased per
manent dedication of identified open
space lands.
An Atademit Crowth Boundary is not
a preservation tool and should not be
substituted lor one.
2) All sensitive habitats should be pro
tected permanently — including those on
the core campus. I liese areas should be
included in the early dedications of the
enhanced development overlay.
Special conservation areas need to be
expanded.
No development should occur in sen
sitive habitat, specifically within the tiger
salamander management /.one, wetland
areas or dispersal habitats of the Califor
nia red-legged Irog. Identification of
existing habitat /.ones still needs to hap
pen in accordance with the I '.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service's Recovery Plan lor the

California red-legged l'rog.
The golf course should be left intact,
with no development on hole number
one or on the driving range — this corri
dor provides an important habitat link
age lot the California tiger salamander
between Lake Lagunita and the 18 acres
of old-growth oak woodland in the mid
dle of the golf course.
'M l he urban limit line (the boundary
between the "Academic Campus" and
"Academic Reserve and ()pen Space")
should not be enlarged.
No facts have been submitted to
explain why ii is justified to place new
urban development beyond the existing
urban limit line. The urban limit line
should onlv be moved to protect impor
tant habitat, making it consistent with
County Ceneral Plan policy C-CI) 21:
"Long term urban growth boundaries
should not include . . . important natural
resource areas."
Vital habitat lot the California tiger
salamander is inside the proposed Aca
demic Crowth Boundary and slotted for
development. It is essential that existing
habitat identified in the California tiger
salamander management agreement be
preserved to prevent the species from
going locally extinct. I he land-use desig
nation of (lampus ()pen Space is not ade
quate to protect this important habitat.
The 25-year Academic Crowth
Boundary proposed bv the stall is porous,
establishing no mechanisms to slow
growth, but t ather allowing the boundary
to be moved when the campus reaches
the "trigger" of million square feet.
1 his level of growth is likely to be
reached in the next 15 years at current
growth t ales. Indeed, this "trigger" could
be perceived as an incentive to speed
growth. Phased dedication of open space
would provide an incentive to slow
growth and create mote efficient devel
opment patterns on the core campus.
•4) The County's Community Plan
should create incentives lor redevelop
ment of the core campus. This should
include the transformation of existing
surface parking into multi-leveled struc
tured parking, redevelopment and inten
sification of the many underutili/ed areas
on the cote campus and required intensi
fication of any new development.

Teach-in was not misbilled
1 am writing this letter to ask you to re

to the large number of Muslims, Arabs
and other sensible and rational people on
this campus, regardless of their faith and
ethnic 'it v. I his includes scores of Jews and
Christians who oppose the oppressive

A teach-in about a c risis is supposed to
give facts and to discuss the when, what,
who and win aspects of any action that
led to that c risis. It is not supposed to be
defending one party or the other. In that
respect, I Ibund that the teach-in did pro

tory Department and the two professors
who presented it.
For the record, the Muslim students

lor the event and none of them agreed.
My guess is that 11 icy could not rise up to

students will attack him in person as they
did.
Freedom-lighters like the Palestinians

University is doing its best to protect its
interests — our interests
Your editorial, "Promises Come Too
Close to Manipulation," is both wrong
headed and misinformed.
You sav that "Stanford's offer of land
for the Jewish Community Center is con
tingent upon approval of the General Use
Permit and Community plan it submitted
to Santa Clara County."
But in fact the offer is contingent upon
approval of a General Use Plan that is
acceptable to the University. As Larry
Morton, director of government and
community relations, has said, the Uni
versity "fully anticipates having a satisfac
tory use permit. Acceptable doesn't mean
it has to have everything we wanted."
I fas it not occured to you that the pro
cess In which an application for such a
plan gets adopted is inevitably a political
process? I o stigmatize it In saying "The
arrangement reeks of backroom politics"
is merely empty rhetoric.
The interests that Stanford is defend
ing in this process are to no small degree
your interests — the interests of Stanford
students, now and in the future. The Uni
versity wants to build housing for both its
people (students, faculty and staff) and
activities (teaching and research). Doing
so requires the enactment by the Board ol
Supervisors of a satisfactory General Use
Plan. That is why the officers of ASSU
and of graduate student organizations
have been vocal supporters of the Uni

the campus newspaper choose to see

'corporate focus'
1 hose of us w ho refuse (or simply can

rial yesterday ("Corporate locus
onstrained Career Fair").
Having reached an enviable yet pre
carious apex in the mid and late 19905,
Stanford now begins slowlv but inevitablv
a course down the spiral.
Don't count on donations, gifts, high
profile* visitors and sports publicity. Once
a pattern of discontent, doubt and soul
searching has been established, the
course cannot be reversed without adopt
ing radical solutions.
So I read the editorial as part of a
question mark growing day by day over
Stanford. A splash of self-criticism, how
ever, would not undermine the editorial's
commitment to human values (arguably
the most endangered species in the
world).
As a regular reader of The Daily, 1
have perceived, in the last four years, a
