Daily should look at its own
'corporate focus'
1 hose of us w ho refuse (or simply can
not) suck tlie golden nipples ol corpo
ratism read with reliel I he Daily's edito
rial yesterday ("Corporate locus
onstrained Career Fair").
Having reached an enviable yet pre
carious apex in the mid and late 19905,
Stanford now begins slowlv but inevitablv
a course down the spiral.
Don't count on donations, gifts, high
profile* visitors and sports publicity. Once
a pattern of discontent, doubt and soul
searching has been established, the
course cannot be reversed without adopt
ing radical solutions.
So I read the editorial as part of a
question mark growing day by day over
Stanford. A splash of self-criticism, how
ever, would not undermine the editorial's
commitment to human values (arguably
the most endangered species in the
world).
As a regular reader of The Daily, 1
have perceived, in the last four years, a
remarkable increase in the frequency and
intensity of corporate presence in its
pages.
I will leave aside the glowing reports
on start-ups. The worst kind of this infil
tration are the whole-page display ads,
where the corporate dragon miraculous
ly disappears in the sublimity of empty
space and /en aphorisms. (Since when
does joining a company lead to Enlight
enment?)

And just a few months ago, I also
raised the problem of featuring ads that
directly exploit pre-graduation anxiety.
It would be a service to us who
applauded yesterday's editorial, if 1 lie
Daily would at least acknowledge the
problem of corporate infiltration in its
own home. Ii is neither a crime nor
humiliation to sav things as they are. Just
common sense.

Chappie editor clarifies argument
In regards to the criticism of my letter
on Monday ("Chappie editor defends
special fees," Oct. 1(>), 1 have a short
response: I he author was absolutely cor
rect. My letter comprised a series of irra
tional, «id hominem attacks; they did not
even remotely resemble a sound argu
ment.
Kut that was the point.
Do I really believe there is the least
inferential connection between anti-spe
cial tee sentiment and racism or homo
phobia? Of course not. Do I really believe
that The Review is classist? Clearly not.
But, did I believe that my words —
rhetorically overblown and uncon
scionably calumnious — would be taken
at face value? Obviously not.
My invectives were outlandish; they
were designed to amuse and provoke, not
to support the thrust of my sincere belief

that exhorting students to refund special
fee is, in some sense, irresponsible.
So now, at this point, 1 am inclined to
rill a little on the objectivism that blinded
the letter's author to my mischevious and
irreverent intent — that Ayn Rand
wouldn't know what a joke was il it bit her
on the face, or that Reaganite conserva
tives are so self-absorbed that the very
idea of treating themselves with a little
levity is terrifying. But that would be an
ad hominem attack, and il might, (iod
forbid, be funny. And we certainly can't
have that, can we?

University should allow faculty leave
I think that it is admirable that the
university permitted Prof. Tom Cam
bell a leave of absence in order to pur
sue another career. Many, many
people in today's workforce are able to
change careers multiple times, some
thing that is probably not only enjoy
able but also greatly beneficial to one's
perspective.
Much of academia is concerned with
knowledge that is based at least partially
upon events in the outside world. Con
versely, the knowledge produced by
academia should be used to further the
