# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Living in limbo: It's just what the doctor ordered 
### CORRINE ERICKSON GUEST COLUMNIST 
Fickle. Indecisive. Confused. I
(.in proudly say that each of
these words has been used to
describe me over the past few
years. Perhaps it's because 1 don't
believe that not having a major, career
and stock portfolio secured by the age of
21 is a late worse than a CI'A below a 1.0.
Last week, 1 unsuccessfully tried to
run over swarms of students with this
mindset at the career fair in White IMa/a.
Since my meager attempt at mass
destruction failed. I'm going i<> appeal to
your reason as a student bod) to support
my movement lot less structure and
more llexibility.
Settle into your classes, make detailed
four-year plans and sign your life and
major away to Axess, but also free your
repressed, indecisive spirits bv remem

bering that the delete button is still with
in your reach.
As I enter my third year (and third
major) at Stanford, the delete button has
come to be my most dependable friend.
I've ( hanged ever)thing from plans to
boyfriends, but even I, now the great
lover ol limbo, have fell the trauma of
giving up <t secure academic and career
track in exchange lot pursuing a passion
,tii(l professional indecision.
()ne fateful night in the middle of last
winter quarter, I realized thai I was tired
of jumping through pre-nied hoops and
darted desperately toward the Knglish
Department. It took me lour and a hall
quarters of sadly sacrificing a social life
for ben/ene rings and abandoning
Charles Dickens for Charles Darwin
before I could trust invsell enough to
leave iliis professionally stable but emo
tionall) unstable path.
Beginning freshman year, I grudg

ing!) restricted my perusal of the time
schedule to the Biology and Chemistry
sections. I envied friends walking to
Knglish classes while I made the endless
bike ride lo the Mudd building.
Last year, my roommate asked me the
real and seemingly obvious /inger thai
changed my college experience eniirelv.
As she kicked back on the couch with her
Irish Literature reading, she looked at
me hunched over my problem set and
asked, "How do you really know for sure
that you want lo be a doctor and spend
the next 1(1 years in school lor it?"
I couldn't even fabricate an answer
that sounded believable. I didn't know
for sure and every chemistry and biolo
gy course I took made me less certain.
Yes, I could drop bio lab and lake Irish
literature. No, I didn't need or want to
lock myself into a career path so earlv
on.
I doubt ili.tt most ofvou really know

what you want to do forever. Today
you might aspire to become a physician,
and tomorrow you'll strive to be the
flip-queen at In-'N-()ut Burger. You'll
sign up for rigorous computer science
classes this quarter, and switch to phi
losophy next winter. Don't feel like you
have to justify it as a temporary phase
you're going through, but embrace it as
the natural state of your open and
ambitious minds.
Stanibrd encourages us to c hange our
minds and explore new interests by not
ollering pre-professional majors. I his
can be offsetting if you're looking fora
pot of stethoscopes at the end of the
umbilical cord.
Cut the cord, forget about your
career path, revel in your collegiate free
dom and save the professional worries
for when your days as a student are com
plete (or when your parents quit sending
you cash).

1 expect and plan to change my mind
about my job, lifestyle and location
throughout my adult life. I hope (hat
when I'm in my forties I'll do something
seemingly insane like quit my law prac
tice to audition lor a soap opera.
Next year, I ma\ join the mass oi stu
dents handing out resumes at the career
fair, but that's because I'll be out of pens
and need to restock, not because 1 want
to jump into corporate America right
after graduation.
Covet and claim your right to be as
indecisive as you like. Go ahead and
change your major or shave your head.
| list don't get too accustomed to look
ing at yoursell in one way or in one
place. Not yet. And for me, maybe never.
