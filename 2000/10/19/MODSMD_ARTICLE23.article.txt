# Carson designs King memorial
## History Prof, creates concept for monument on Washington Mall 
### JOHN SHASANMI 
History Prof. Clayborne Carson, working
with the ROMA Design Group of Sail Francisco,
produced the winning plan for the Martin
Luther King Jr. Memorial to be built on the Na
tional Mall in Washington, I).C.
A jury of architects and designers chose ('.ar
son's submission from a field of more than 900
entries.
The memorial will be the first on the Mall to
honor an African-American. Construction is
scheduled to begin in 2003.
Carson, the director of the King Papers Pro
ject, said working on the memorial was a contin
uation of his work at the Papers Project. I le lias
been working on the project since 1985 at there
quest of King's widow, Corel ta Scott King.
Carson initially thought that any "memorial
to King should make it clear that he's a symbol
for something larger."

I le said he wanted to show that King contin
ues to be the voice for many others in the civil
lights movement. Therefore, the memorial
would commemorate "the movement as a
whole" and not just King.
Bonnie Fisher and Boris 1 )ramov of ROMA
worked with ('.arson to turn this idea into a phys
ical model and structure.
I he memorial's landscape will consist of
(leaved granite boulders, gentle streams and
cascading waters. It will also include King's
words and imagery, primarily from his 1963 "1
I lave a Dream" speech.
The design's central element is a curving 15-
fooi-tall, 600-loot-long "water wall" inscribed
with King's quotations and marking major
events in his life.
Carson said a smooth curtain of water will
How over panels with engraved text, set off by
turbulent water rushing over rough granite.
I lie water will spring from individual streams.
According to Carson, the flowing waters will
call attention to King's metaphor of "justice
rolling down like waters, righteousness like a
might) stream."
These streams will flow from a row 0f24 small
nic hes lining the shady "path of racial justice
commemorating the martyrs of the movement"

above Ihe wall, Carson said.
Visitors will be able to walk on
top of this water wall.
A boulder is set away from
the wall in the center of the
monument.

The missing boulder is referred to as a
"stone of hope," with an image of King carved
out of the stone. This image shows King's arms
crossed and ready for action. Carson calls this
rock the "spiritual presence of King."
The figure of King will face the Jefferson
Memorial and will serve as "a challenge to the
nation," Carson said. The figure's orientation
will symbolize a pivotal point of King's "I 1 lave a
Dream" speech and its reference to the promise
of justice and liberty.
The King memorial is an "open-ended" pro
ject, Carson said.
112 ile design is created in a way that allows for
others, both living and deceased, who have been
involved with the civil lights movement to be in
cluded in the monument.
King called these people "martyrs in the path
of racial justice."
Congress approved the memorial in 1996,
after lobbying from Alpha Phi Alpha, a national
black fraternity.
