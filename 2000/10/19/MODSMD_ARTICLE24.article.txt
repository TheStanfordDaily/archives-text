# Creative writing minor kicks off
## 
### WILL OREMUS 
Beginning this quarter, the
English Department is ottering a
new minor in creative writing. The
goal of the minor is to address the
needs of non-English majors who
want to pursue either poetry-or fic
tion writing in their course ot
study, according to English Prol.
Tobias Wolff, the minor's director.
Previously, students who were
interested in creative writing could
either major in English with a cre
ative-writing emphasis or simply
take classes on t he topic on a
cc )urse-by-course basis.
Because creative-writing cours
es are demanding and have entry
requirements, it was impractical
for non-majors to take many ot
them, Wolff said. With no minor to
work toward, students had little in
centive to lollow a comprehensive
course of study in the program.
"We began to get the sense from
our workshops that there were stu
dents from other disciplines who
wanted to do work in creative writ
ing and receive recognition for it."
said Wolff, who is a noted fiction
writer. " The new minor allows lor
a more systematic approach to the
subject than taking a course here
and a course there."
The requirements for the
minor are clearly defined and offer
little flexibility in course choice, be
cause there are a limited number
of courses in the program.
Students can choose between a
loc us in fiction or poetry. Both fic
tion and poetry minors must take
four writing workshops and two
English literature courses.
In order to be accepted into the
minor, students must have com
pleted either English 90 or 92 and
been admitted into either English
190 or 192.
"We've had interest from sever
al people from other areas such as

engineering,'' said Creative Writ
ing Program Administrator Gay
Pierce. "[Classes in] the creative
writing program, particularly the
fiction portion, are very popular."
According to Pierce, the minor's
founders had not expected it to be
instituted so soon.
"To have this minor was our
dream," she said. "It went through
so quickly that we were somewhat
startled."
Creative writing is already a
well-established discipline at Stan
lord. he added. Courses are taught
by six full-time faculty, of whom
three are poets and three are prose
writers.
Six lecturers, four in fiction and
two in poetry, lead workshops in
creative writing. All twelve faculty
are writers themselves.
"It seems to me the creative
writing program has an incredible
reputation," said sophomore Jen
1 Jennings, an English major. "The
people I have met in the program
strike me as very committed to
writing."
The program will also feature a
visiting writer each year. This
year's author is Maxine Hong
Kingston.
"I didn't know they had a minor
in creative writing, but it sounds
like a great idea," said Hennings.
"1 know a lot of people who love
creative writing but don't want to
devote their entire career to it.
"This would give them an op
portunity to explore creative writ
ing without having to be an Eng
lish major and give up their prima
ry interest," she added. She said
she plans to pursue the creative
writing emphasis within the Eng
lish major.
"I would be upset if I loved
creative writing but couldn't
minor in it," said junior Karen
Corby, a mathematical and com
putational science major.
