Logan loin is ,i woman of m\ sten.
No one was sure if fom would pla\ for I lie Stan
ford women's vollevball team iliis year. In lad, most
people assumed she would not pla\ lor Stanford dur
ing her sophomore veai. having just finished plaving
with the I .S. national team .it the Summer ()l\ mpics
in Sydney.
F.ven loin hersell had yet to decide il she would
play this season as she sat on the team's bench m
Maples Pavilion two weeks ago watching her team
mates take on Washington.
She had arriv ed on c ampus onh hours earlier, re
turning to the Farm for the first time since she left
during winter quarter last vear to start training with
the National l earn.
Soevervone was naturallv surprised to see Tom in
uniform, with her trademark No. IT) on her back, on
the court against ('.alilornia onh four davs later. ()l
course, 110 one was surprised that she posted a mate h
higli 1 7 kills in her first game back for Stanford while

leading the ('.ardinal to a ,'i-O victor).
"There were a bunch of different options," Tom
said of returning after the Olympics. "Not coming
hack and taking the fall off was one of them, doming
hack .md red shirting and coming back and playing
were the other ones.
"I think I could ma\be use some time oil. but 1 get
bored really easily, so after a week or two 1 would be
likc,'( live me something to do." 1 was going to be here
anvwa\. and I'm not one to sit around and watch."
1 ler propensity lor boredom is great news to the
other members of the Stanford squad, who are more
than happy that Tom is back out on the court with
them.
"Logan brings this team a go-to hitter," said the
team's captain, senior Lindsay Kagawa. "She's some
one we're not necessarily going to relv on, but she
brings lis stability at the outside position and gives this
team <i confidence boost on the court."
loin's return to Stanford ended an eight month
journev for the outside hitter from Salt Lake City,
during which she established tier
self as one of i he premiere lemale
volleyball j»la\ers in the country.
She had already established hersell
at the collegiate level alter her
breakout season lor the Cardinal
last year.
During her fresh man cam
paign, she became only the fourth
freshman in NCAA history to be
named a lirst-team All-American
and was voted Volleyball Maga
zine's Freshman of the Year.

"1 think she's the number one
college player in the country," said
interim head coach Denise Corlett.
"She's got the hitting ability, the
range, and she's one of the better
blocking outside hitters in the
game. She'll definitely go down as
one of the best players in NCAA
history."
Perhaps even as one of the best
players ever, loin's performance
in Sydney has led main to compare
her to kareh Kiraly, widely accept
ed as the best men's volleyball play
er in I S history. Despite an auspi
cious start to her collegiate and in
ternational careers, Tom is quick to
shun those kinds of comments.

"I tend to ignore those things,"
Tom said. "1 play volleyball. It's
something I'm not really thinking
about. I'm basically taking things
one step at a time."
lorn was no stranger to interna
tional play before this summer. She
toured overseas with the Junior
National Team several limes dur
ing high school, starling her fresh
man year, which is especially re
markable considering that she did
not start playing volley ball until the
eighth grade.
"It was basically a way to pass the
time in eighth grade," she said.
This past spring, a mere six
years after picking up the sport,

Tom found herself embarking on a
pre-Olympic tour with the Ameri
can squad that took her to all cor
ners of the globe, including Russia,
the Netherlands, Switzerland and
China. Soon after, she found her
self at the Summer Olympics is
Sydney, where the magnitude of
the experience really began to sink
in.
"Walking around the Olympic
village is weird, 'cause you're like,
'Wow, there's an Olympian,' but
then you realize, 'Wait, I'm an
(Mympian too,' " Tom said.
"It hit me a little bit while I was
there with the opening ceremonies
and the first match. But it's reallv

hit me afterwards, realizing I was
part of something so huge in the
world."
Tom's breakthrough perfor
mance in Sydney highlighted the
American team's remarkable run
fora medal, which eventually fell
just short. With upset wins over
China in pool play and a huge win
over the favored Koreans in the
quarterfinals, the U.S. squad went
further than anyone expected.
Many observers l<x)k ahead at
the impact Tom could have on the
game of volleyball in general. Cor
lett, who played on the U.S. Na
tional Team in 1982 and 1983 and
remains involved with USA Volley

ball, sees Tom as the centerpiece of
the sport in America in the years to
come.
"I think she's volleyball's fu
ture," Corlett said. "In order for
the sport to get publicity, she has to
be the one they use to get it out into
the public eye. 1 think she can do
for volleyball what Mia Hamm has
done for soccer in America."
For now, Tom is more con
cerned with getting adjusted to
being back at school.
"Being gone for so long, it's
hard getting back into things, but
I'm getting there," Tom said. "1
don't even have my stuff here yet. 1
need my TV and my stereo."

brings lis stability at the outside position and gives this
team <i confidence boost on the court."
loin's return to Stanford ended an eight month
journev for the outside hitter from Salt Lake City,
during which she established tier
self as one of i he premiere lemale
volleyball j»la\ers in the country.
She had already established hersell
at the collegiate level alter her
breakout season lor the Cardinal
last year.
During her fresh man cam
paign, she became only the fourth
freshman in NCAA history to be
named a lirst-team All-American
and was voted Volleyball Maga
zine's Freshman of the Year.

"1 think she's the number one
college player in the country," said
interim head coach Denise Corlett.
"She's got the hitting ability, the
range, and she's one of the better
blocking outside hitters in the
game. She'll definitely go down as
one of the best players in NCAA
history."
Perhaps even as one of the best
players ever, loin's performance
in Sydney has led main to compare
her to kareh Kiraly, widely accept
ed as the best men's volleyball play
er in I S history. Despite an auspi
cious start to her collegiate and in
ternational careers, Tom is quick to
shun those kinds of comments.

"I tend to ignore those things,"
Tom said. "1 play volleyball. It's
something I'm not really thinking
about. I'm basically taking things
one step at a time."
lorn was no stranger to interna
tional play before this summer. She
toured overseas with the Junior
National Team several limes dur
ing high school, starling her fresh
man year, which is especially re
markable considering that she did
not start playing volley ball until the
eighth grade.
"It was basically a way to pass the
time in eighth grade," she said.
This past spring, a mere six
years after picking up the sport,

Tom found herself embarking on a
pre-Olympic tour with the Ameri
can squad that took her to all cor
ners of the globe, including Russia,
the Netherlands, Switzerland and
China. Soon after, she found her
self at the Summer Olympics is
Sydney, where the magnitude of
the experience really began to sink
in.
"Walking around the Olympic
village is weird, 'cause you're like,
'Wow, there's an Olympian,' but
then you realize, 'Wait, I'm an
(Mympian too,' " Tom said.
"It hit me a little bit while I was
there with the opening ceremonies
and the first match. But it's reallv

hit me afterwards, realizing I was
part of something so huge in the
world."
Tom's breakthrough perfor
mance in Sydney highlighted the
American team's remarkable run
fora medal, which eventually fell
just short. With upset wins over
China in pool play and a huge win
over the favored Koreans in the
quarterfinals, the U.S. squad went
further than anyone expected.
Many observers l<x)k ahead at
the impact Tom could have on the
game of volleyball in general. Cor
lett, who played on the U.S. Na
tional Team in 1982 and 1983 and
remains involved with USA Volley

ball, sees Tom as the centerpiece of
the sport in America in the years to
come.
"I think she's volleyball's fu
ture," Corlett said. "In order for
the sport to get publicity, she has to
be the one they use to get it out into
the public eye. 1 think she can do
for volleyball what Mia Hamm has
done for soccer in America."
For now, Tom is more con
cerned with getting adjusted to
being back at school.
"Being gone for so long, it's
hard getting back into things, but
I'm getting there," Tom said. "1
don't even have my stuff here yet. 1
need my TV and my stereo."
