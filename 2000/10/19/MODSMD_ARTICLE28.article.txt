# World Series fun gone in a New York minute
## 
### 
Start spreadin' the news! Bov hardy,
there's nothing I enjoy more than a
great World Series! And speaking of
great World Series, how great is this
year s Fall Classic! (Lan you even imagine?

Both New York teams
finally in it together!
Truly, we live in the
greatest possible world!
1 mean, nothing gets
the true fan's blood
pumping like a great ri
valry. And now we've
got the best of the best
— two great New York
I I — 11

teams paired up for all r
the marbles! New York can't lose! How
great is that!
The whole spectacle brings .1 smile t<> m\
lace. The Bronx vs. Queens, the 1 train vs.
the 7 train, the Bombers vs. the Amazin's —
what could be more American? 1 can't wait
to see the Kmpire Stale Building, the Statue
<>l Liberty, even Central Park covered in
Mets and Yankees paraphernalia. I he
streets and bars ol Manhattan and Brook
lyn will be thronging with lifelong I.ins. here
to see their team — and the whole city —
triumph.
Best of all, it's a World Series with he
roes. Yankees owner George Steinbren
ner's been a godsend to the game for years
with his financial dedication to greatness.
Mets manager Bobby Valentine, the lovable
scamp, always has some new trick up his
sleeve to showcase his team s c an t-lose.

plucky attitude.
I here are storied veterans like Yankees
Paul O'Neill and Roger Clemens — bless
their hearts — (basing maybe their last
championship, and great ones linallv get
ting their due, like Vlets Mike Pia/./.a and
Edgar"do Allbn/o. No matter which way you
look, you'll see nothing but class and men
that know how to win. Go to it, tellas! Win
for your town!
I bis is what sports are all about! New
York, New York! Fhe Subwav Series! 1 lie
greatest show on Earth in the greatest < it\
on Earth! You can't ask lor more.
Well. I'm about out of time today, no
make sure to read next week when we make
.i heartfelt salute to international babv
smugglers. Salt ol the earth, those guvs —
real champs in their own way. I mil then,
go New York!

Jeff Cooper, a senior, wants to wake n/t in a city
that doesn'/ sleep. Because if he can make there. he
can make it anywhere.
Are they gone? All those insufferable
smug New Yorkers? Good. ('.lose the door.
I'm sorry about that tripe above, but I want
ed to get rid of the natives — couldn't stand
to look at 'em.
Why, God, whv have you forsaken us?
What have we done to deserve this punish
ment? Have the lampa Bay Devil Rays so
offended vou that vou have smitten us with


Jeff Cooper
ihis curse, this plague, this Subway
Series?
The only thing worse than that
guy who thinks he's always right,
who thinks that the sun rises and
sets over his bed every day, is when
that guy actually is right. Day in,
clay out, you hear the New York
ers, you see the headlines: "The
Biggest and The Best!" "The
Amazin's Do It Again!" "Ya Gotta
Believe! 11 le Team Ot'The Cen
tury!" And then the Cardinals and
the Mariners go roll over and die

and every yahoo between Yonkers
and Long Island gets to rub it in
your liice.
What a nightmare matchup this
is. On the one hand, you've got the
Mets, who maintain this chip on
their shoulder about being the un
derdogs, the scrappers, the Rudys
oi the major leagues. As if they
don't have the lilth-highest payroll
in baseball. As if they don't cringe
and hide their jerseys when an
eight-year-old in an Atlanta Braves
r-shirt walks into the room. As if
their manager Bobby Valentine
can lit into a subway car without
three bodyguards to make room
for his ego.
Hell, to hear Mets fans talk

about their squad, they've got
overlooked Hall-of-Famers at
every position. Has there ever
been a more overrated second
basemen than Edgardo Alfonso?
And Piazza, while not overrated, is
just Mark McGwire in pads. Every
time he tries to throw a runner out,
1 cringe and wait tor his kneecaps
to leap out of his legs crying for
help.
On the other hand, there are
the Yankees, who pay $300 fora
haircut and then tell everyone,
"Our hair just knows how to stay
cut. It's hair with class." After stag
gering into the playoffs with the
fifth-best American League
record, they're back to swaggering

like they won 150 games.
From ()'Neill to Jose Canseco to
(shudder) Chuck Knoblauch, the
team is littered with overpaid fad
ing legends who moan and weep
about every strikeout as if they
were entitled to a three-run homer
every time they came to bat. Let's
not even talk about Clemens, who
came close to singlehandedly los
ing the series to Oakland but al
ready has himself penciled in as
World Series MVP.
And then there's New York it
self. Anywhere else, a regional
World Series would be tolerable.
San Francisco and Oakland had
the Bay Area Battle in '89 and
you certainly couldn't fault all

three Oakland As fans for being
too rowdy. Thankfully, we don't
have to worry about Chicago fac
ing this problem, since the Cubs
are, after all, the Cubs. Cincin
nati-Cleveland, Texas-Houston,
Anaheim-L.A. (ha!) — nobody
would hate these matchups. If
those teams win, people know
they struggled.
But in New York, they'll have it
both ways. One minute they'll
sniff, "Another World Series? Oh,
throw it over there with the rest."
The next, they'll be taunting your
home team from high atop their
giant pile of money.
The slim silver lining in this bat
tle is that if New York cannot lose,

it also cannot win. Whichever team
loses will have to endure a year of
pointed jabs from their friends and
neighbors. Jobs are on the line,
and someone in this hellish conflict
of inflated egos and salaries will
certainly take the fall, be it Valen
tine or whoever George Steinbren
ner feels worthy of his wrath
(hopefully everybody).
But it will be cold comfort for
the rest of us, because one way or
another, the New Yorkers win
again. We can only shake our
heads and wait till next year.

Jeff Cooper, a senior, mil be watching
tape-rfela\e<l cricket ch/irnpionships in
stead of the World Series this xear.
