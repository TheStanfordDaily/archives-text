# World Series fun gone in a New York minute
## 
### 
Start spreadin' the news! Bov hardy,
there's nothing I enjoy more than a
great World Series! And speaking of
great World Series, how great is this
year s Fall Classic! (Lan you even imagine?

Both New York teams
finally in it together!
Truly, we live in the
greatest possible world!
1 mean, nothing gets
the true fan's blood
pumping like a great ri
valry. And now we've
got the best of the best
— two great New York
I I — 11

teams paired up for all r
the marbles! New York can't lose! How
great is that!
The whole spectacle brings .1 smile t<> m\
lace. The Bronx vs. Queens, the 1 train vs.
the 7 train, the Bombers vs. the Amazin's —
what could be more American? 1 can't wait
to see the Kmpire Stale Building, the Statue
<>l Liberty, even Central Park covered in
Mets and Yankees paraphernalia. I he
streets and bars ol Manhattan and Brook
lyn will be thronging with lifelong I.ins. here
to see their team — and the whole city —
triumph.
Best of all, it's a World Series with he
roes. Yankees owner George Steinbren
ner's been a godsend to the game for years
with his financial dedication to greatness.
Mets manager Bobby Valentine, the lovable
scamp, always has some new trick up his
sleeve to showcase his team s c an t-lose.

plucky attitude.
I here are storied veterans like Yankees
Paul O'Neill and Roger Clemens — bless
their hearts — (basing maybe their last
championship, and great ones linallv get
ting their due, like Vlets Mike Pia/./.a and
Edgar"do Allbn/o. No matter which way you
look, you'll see nothing but class and men
that know how to win. Go to it, tellas! Win
for your town!
I bis is what sports are all about! New
York, New York! Fhe Subwav Series! 1 lie
greatest show on Earth in the greatest < it\
on Earth! You can't ask lor more.
Well. I'm about out of time today, no
make sure to read next week when we make
.i heartfelt salute to international babv
smugglers. Salt ol the earth, those guvs —
real champs in their own way. I mil then,
go New York!

Jeff Cooper, a senior, wants to wake n/t in a city
that doesn'/ sleep. Because if he can make there. he
can make it anywhere.
Are they gone? All those insufferable
smug New Yorkers? Good. ('.lose the door.
I'm sorry about that tripe above, but I want
ed to get rid of the natives — couldn't stand
to look at 'em.
Why, God, whv have you forsaken us?
What have we done to deserve this punish
ment? Have the lampa Bay Devil Rays so
offended vou that vou have smitten us with


Jeff Cooper
