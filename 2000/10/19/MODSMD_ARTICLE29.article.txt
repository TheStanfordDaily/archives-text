# Cardinal enters critical stretch
## 
### EMILY ST. THOMAS 
Two weeks remain, and then there are no more
guarantees and certainly no points lor second place.
|ust two more weeks until the playoffs when the
Stanford Held hocke\ team (7- ( .) overall, 3-2 North
ern Pacific Conference) will have to travel to St.
Louis for the NorPac Conference championships.
I hat leaves little time to put the final touches on
a team that has gone through a series of ups and
downs to discover that in two weeks, all thc\ will he
able to depend on is each other.
Coming off two wins last week against Cornell
I niversitv (3-5) and the I niversitx of Pennsvlvania
(2-N), the Cardinal feels like it is fmalh beginning to
put the whole picture together.
Karlier in the season, the team faced some prob
lems generating substantial offense, but it dominat
ed Penn. out-shooting the Quakers 7-0 in the see-
But they are a young team, something head
coach Shervl Johnson acknowledged after the Penn
game as she expressed her outlook for the season.
" I would like to see ns be able to put teams awav,"
she said. "That's just a matter of experience."
Before heading off to St. Louis, however, the (ar
dinal still has four more games to play. The team will
use these games to gain the experience they need to
become an even more formidable opponent.
fhe Cardinal matches up on the road against
University of the Pacific this Saturday and will be
back on the Farm to play L C-Davis on Sunday .it 1
p.m. While I OP is the last conference game of the
season, Davis, a dub program, will be a chance for
the (lardinal to finalize their unitv as a team.
