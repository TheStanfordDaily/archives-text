her present < areer as a respected indepen
cU'lit singer-songw riter contained <i lot ol

As an undergraduate, (ireen participat

for changes lor < ultural diversity. Hut she

People a (appella group and w as involved
iu the Hay Area dance culture.
I was alwaxs straddling two worlds,"
(ireen said ol her ac ademic and political
life* .ind her longtime love ol performance.
For Oreen, whose live performances

and debut album "Mv Crime" have re
ceived critical accolades in Los Angeles
music circles, the choice to be a singer
songwriter was not easy to make.
Like manv Stanford students, she felt
the pressure to follow more common ca
reer paths. At a I niversit\ where, accord
ing to the Career Development Center,
more than 95 percent ol undergraduates
go on to lull-lime jobs or graduate school,
(ireen discovered in her last year ol col
lec ge decided she wanted to wt ite songs lor
a living.
"1 was so torn between the phenomenal
education I had and what I wanted to do."
(ireen said. "1 told myself, 'You should be
,i civil rights attorney or an en\ iron mental
activist or a psychologist,' something that
had more prestige."
Hut by 1995, having already performed
in lour girl bands and a funk band, (ireen
decided her "gift is performing and
singing mv soul and giving it up to | my au
dience]."

I lie strength of her commitment was
tested the following year, when Kpstein-
Barr, <111 often life-long or terminal fatigue
illness, took over her life. Isolated horn
friends and confined 10 her bedroom lor a
vear-and-a-hall, Green countered her de
pression .iiul self-doubt I)\ writing what
would later become the title track ol her
debut album.
"'My ('.rime' was about all these gills I'd
received. What il I can't give what I've been
given?" (ireen said, as if the problem were
still fresh in her mind today. "[' he illness|
nail) made me locus on what 1 wanted.
What il taught me was patience."
Willi reassurances and rewards from
ilie music industn few and far between,
the life of a siai \ ing artist is a far crv from
that of a student or career-woman.
"When vou're .1 student you're reward
ed with vour As; when vou get a job it's
your paw hecks," Cireen sa\s. " The onlv
111 i 11 vou're rewarded with is your audi
ence, which is incredible, which keeps me

going."
In the last ten years, however, Green
has gotten much more than a standing
ovation.

For "M\ ( rime." she implemented a va

with numerous musicians.
(ireen (ites her experiences at Stanford

as among her most important influences.
Two songs on her album, Sisyphus and
"Malcom X." come directly from her stud
ies at Stanford.
"Stanford was such a lull experience in
so many different ways. Of course it was
going to inlluence how I communicate and
live," (ireen said.
Returning to Stanford 10 years later for
her ( lass reunion, she is proud ol her ac
complishments but had some qualms
about seeing her old c lassmates again.
"Honestly, I didn't want to come,"
Cireen said. "Most of my peers are pulling
in a minimum ol $50,000 to six figures on
«i path towards success.'
Despite the financial uncertainty ola
music career, (ireen continues to strive for
"that ever-elusive record label."
"Part of me knows in some sort of
strange wav that I'm doing something
courageous that most people won't get to
do — getting on stage and turning them
on," Cireen said.
