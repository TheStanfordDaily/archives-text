# Scaling Quad attracts adventurous students

### KEYA JAVARAM 
1 lave you ever been silting through set
ices in Memorial (Ihurch, ga/ing through
magnificent stained glass window, and
ivear you saw a face peer in?
A religious apparition? Perhaps, but
tore likely, it was just another ambitious
lanfbrd student, climbing not the corpo
ite ladder but the side of the building.
"Buildering," sophomore Dana John
>ll explained, "is the technical term used
>r climbing on buildings when you're not
oped in. [It's] just you and the chalk bag
ml your sticky, rubber shoes."
Buildering has been a popular trend
round the Stanford campus for decades
iul is evidenced by the chalky residue —
\hich helps climbers maintain their
rip — that can be found gracing the sand
lone edifices of Memorial C Hum h, Kncina
I all «uhl the Main Quad.
Sophomore Jon Glassman explained

the multi-faceted magnetism the Quad
walls seem to hold over campus clitnlx-rs.
1 he first appeal is accessibility. Before the
new climbing wall was built early this quar
ter iu deOuerre, the Quad was the onl\
climbing option available on campus.
Secondly, (llassman said, the rough, un
even walls of the Quad have main charac
teristics of natural rock.
" 1 hough the walls don't have many of
the deep cracks that most real rock will
have, there are certain routes that are real
ly ven similar to some intermediate rock,"
he said.
Finally, the Quad walls offer an exciting
and challenging rock climbing venue.
"One of the fun things about climbing
the Quad is that there are definite goals,
such as reaching a roof or window sill,"
C ilassmau said. "I definitely climb the Quad
for the challenge, as well as just some expe
rience and training."
According to Johnson, stories are

passed around campus of a couple of' Sta
nford students who carried the casual activ
ity of campus buildering into University
history. As legend lias it, they climbed
1 loover rower, placing take footprints up
the side of the building as they ascended.
When the Universit\ ordered them to
clean up the ibotprints, they added anoth
er set ol prints so that the f(x>tsteps trav
eled in both directions, up and down the
tower.
While the legitimacy of such tales re
mains in question, the I niversitv's policy
on wall-climbing is clear. Implemented in
19861n tlien-l niversity President Donald
kennedv, it strict!) prohibits buildering
011 the walls of the Main Quad.
Director of Risk Management [ell Seil
bach recounted tlie official statement from
memory.
"Stanford I niversit) prohibits climbing
011 the surface of any campus struc
ture . .. for reasons of personal safetv and

t< > protect buildings fix>m damage and defe
cation," said Seilbach.
In August of the same year, the policy
was slightly amended. The University
opened the back of the C.ummings Art
Building and the old Chemistry building
for buildering purposes.
I iowever, the University stood fit 111 in its
prohibition of the use of'chalk and climbing
to an\ height that exceeds the climber's
own.
Fortunately for policy-abiding campus
climbers, there are alternative resources for
a quick ( limbing fix.
In response to strong student interest in
rock climbing, deGuerre opened a new
climbing wall this year, said Assoc. Vice
Provost for Facilities Chris Christofferson.
fhe facility is open Monday through
Ihursday from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. and Fri
day from noon to 4 p.m.
In addition, there are on-campus
groups dedicated to climbing and the great

outdoors. Redwood Outdoor (Hub lias a
( limbing gn >up I bat cc h >rdinates a variety of
clinibiug trips including instructional trips
at all levels and travels throughout (lalifor
nia and beyond.
Also, tlit* C )utdoor Education Program is
a group <>l volunteer students who teach
"Introduction to Wilderness Skills"
through the(ieolog) Department.
1 he ( lass (overs minimum impact skills,
wilderness travel, geology, ecology and
more. Tvpi( ally one of their lour trips each
quarter is devoted to climbing.
There is a bittersweet sentiment of possi
ble decline in campus buildering, but a si
multaneous e\< itement at the many devel
oping options lot ( limbers.
"The indoor climbing wall cut down sig
nificantly on the number of people climb
ing on the Quad, which is really sad," said
senior Dan Arnold. "But, at the same time,
it's not all that sad because that indoor wall
is pretty damn cool."
