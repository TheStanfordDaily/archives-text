Freshman fon/vard Noor Daewood fights
for possession against a Cornell defender
in an Oct. 1 1 match. Her presence on of
fense will be crucial as the Cardinal enters
a critical stretch of games leading to the
conference championships. Daewood must
help Stanford set the tempo as it takes on
the University of the Pacific on a grass field,
slower than the Cardinal's own home turf.


Sophomore outside hitter Michelle Chambers,
shown here Oct. 14 against No. 18 Long Beach
State, used excellent passing and defense to
help the No. 17 Cardinal to a sweep of the

mores Logan Tom and Ashley Ivy, will lead the
Cardinal south to face conference opponents
No.B UCLA and No. 4 Southern California.
