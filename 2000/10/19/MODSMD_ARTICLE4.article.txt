### DAVID ABRIL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The six women who organized and par
ticipated in the 1995 Stanford (-hicanocom
munity hunger strike reunited at a meeting
in El Cetitro Chicano on Tuesday night.
They met to tell the story of the hunger
strike to new students and revitalize the
grape-boycott campaign.
Speaking to a full room of students, the
women who led the strike talked about the
reasons they protested, the University's re
sponse to the strike and the legacy ol their
demonstration.
MEChA co-chair Gabrielle Rico orga
nized the event to rekindle student interest
in the grape issue and student activism at

large.
"We feel that the Stanford community
has lost touch with the grape issue," Rico
said." The meeting was geared to be an inti
mate conversation with the original hunger
strikers in which they could share their wis
dom on activism.
"We fell the need to reconnect with stu
dents, have a reunion with the former
MEChAnistas, and refuel our energy on
campus."
I he meeting comes at a time when stu
dent interest in the grape debate has dwin
dled. Every year, students vote on whether
they want their residence or dining hall to
serve non-union grapes. In 1996, when the
issue was first put to a vote, an overwhelm
ing majority supported the boycott.
Every year since then, voter participation
rates have declined, and last year a majority
of those voting opposed the boycott f<>r the
first time since 1996.
"Stanford is literally a bubble and there

simply isn't enough awareness <>l
this issue, said Rico. "If vou clri\c
30 or 40 miles awa\ from here,
though, you would see die workei s.
So the grape boycott is avers rele

campus."
During a discussion period at
the meeting, students expressed
frustration with student apatln hut
also criticised the voting procedure
and the s\ stem used to educate stu
dents about grapes.

their residents.
" I he RAs have a lot of influence
on the freslunen, and it the RA

conditions endured b\ migrant

According to strikei I atnara Al
varaclo, student attitudes toward
the issue impeded their ellorts.

racial slurs.
"We had done a lot of work,"
said si like organizer l.ubia Her
nandez. "We made presentations to
the dorms where we were treated
badly. And when students shouted
racial slurs at the movie, there was
no administrative response.
I lie crucial event, according to
Alvarado, was the firing ol adminis
trator (let ilia Burtiaga.
"Fora person of hei level to he
lired, we felt disrespected, she

the rehiring of Burt iaga through
administrative channels, the\ tie

"We had gone through all the
hoops and gone through all the
channels," Alvarado said. "We
didn't just sutldenlvdecide'Let's go
on hunger strike." I lie process look
a long time and was well thought
out."
According it) striker Linda l'ri
eto, the timing for such .1 strike was
right because similar actions were
taking place on other California
campuses.
I lie strikers demanded that the
I niversitx institute a campus-wide
bovcott on grapes not endorsed by
the United Farm Workers, the es
tablishment of a communitv tenter

Burtiaga and the creation of a ('.hi
