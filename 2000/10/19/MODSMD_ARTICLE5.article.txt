# Candidates differ on globalization's merits
## 
### LAURA COLEMAN 
In the post-Cold War era, politicians in
creasingly discuss global unity rather than in
ternational conflict. This year's presidential
candidates have different views about Ameri
ca's role in the world, varying from increased
global involvement to isolationism.
Democrat Vice President Al Gore and Re
publican Texas Gov. George VV. Bush support
globalization, an increased worldwide eco
nomic interdependence, and see it as a positive
opportunity and a challenge, whereas both
Green Party candidate Ralph Nader and Re

form Party candidate Pat Buchanan would like
to see America's involvement abroad decrease.
Al Gore's policy of "forward engagement,"
an effort to open new markets abroad, would
address potential international conflicts before
they become crises. Through his policy, the
United States would maintain a strong defense
and globally promote the rule of law. fiscal dis
cipline, sound economic policy, education and
investment in people.
When it comes to foreign policy, George
Bush wants to know if a specific policy or con
flict, "Is . . . in our nation's interest," as he said
during the second presidential debate.

Through his notion of a "distinctly Ameri
can Internationalism," Bush would concen
trate on national interests such as promoting a
democratic West linked together by free trade.
Green Party candidate Ralph Nader, in con
trast, would like to launch "a rigorous eflort .it
waging peace" with his conception of preven
tative diplomacy, through which he aims t<>
promote other nations' self-sufficiency and
self-determination.
Pat Buchanan of the Reform Parts advo
cates the adoption of a foreign polio that


JOY LEE/The Stanford Daily
"phases out foreign aid and focus
es instead on forgotten Americans
here at home." He claims he
would "withdraw from all global
organizations that do not serve
U.S. interests," if he were elected
president.
As the race narrows between
frontrunners Gore and Bush,
they have adopted foreign policies
with many similar aspects.
• Both candidates support an in
crease in defense spending.
• Both support moderate changes
in International Monetary Fund
lending practices.
• Both support economic sanc
tions and "containment" of Iraq.
• Both oppose new International

Monetary Fund loans to Russia.
Despite these similarities, the
candidates also have some differ
ences in their policies.
• Gore supports a limited nation
al defense that doesn't threaten
the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
with Russia. Bush supports a
large-scale national defense sys
tem and would cancel the anti-bal
listic missile treaty with Russia to
do so.
• Bush opposes the Kyoto global
warming treaty, which aims to
prevent global warming by reduc
ing greenhouse gas emissions.
Gore supports it.
• (lore supports the Comprehen
sive lest Ban Treaty, which aims
to c urb the spread of weapons of
mass destruction. Bush opposes it.
• Bush supports the Taiwan Secu
rity Enhancement Act, which calls
for closer ties to Taipei. Gore op

poses it.
Both Hush and Gore take a
global view oi'foreign policy, with
Gore leaning more toward envi
ronmentally friendly policies and
Bush more focused on weapons
development.
Nader and Buchanan, in com
parison, are both skeptical about
the effects of globalization, with
Nader seeking to reform many
policies m order to respect the
planet's ecology and peoples.
Buchanan seeks to withdraw al
most entirely from overseas in
volvement.
I lie candidates' views on the
World Trade Organization are in
accord with their positions on
globalization in general.
• Gore would like to modernize
the \\"l () and make it accountable
on issues of trade, labor rights and
environmental protection.

• Bush welcome's China's entry
into the WTO, but for so-called
"rogue states" such as Iraq, Bush
advocates traditional policies of
containment.
• Nader is against the WTO, aver
ring it subordinates health and
safety standards to the dictates of
international commerce.
• Buchanan is against the WTO
and feels that "bringing China
into the WTO is a death sentence
for countless American small busi
nesses."
Similarly, the leading candi
dates support expanding NATO,
while the other two favor limiting
it.
• Gore supports maintaining
United States military presence in
Europe to respond to crises and to
intervene to end ethnic cleansing,
such ,is in Kosovo.
• Bush supports strengthening
NATO !>\ having Hurope invest
more in ilelense capabilities and
supports having the American
president lead in militarv conllit I.
• Nader would close all foreign
militarv bases.
• Mm hanan is against NA I () and
claims ii "has become a jobs pro
gram lbi American generals." lie
disagreed with the militarv's in
tervention in Kosovo, tailing re
ports of genocide there "a lionen
doiis exaggeration."
Regarding the Middle Hast, the
candidates' views are also niosiK
similar.
• (lore supports strengthening
the I nited Slates-Israel relation
ship. I lis lii st priorit\ there isend
ing the violence.
• bush would advance peace in

the Middle Kasi based on Israel's
security.
• Nader believes the I uited
Slates should use its political, eco
nomic and militar\ leverage in the
area.
• lUichanan said there is nothing
much lor the I uited States to do
while the lighting goes on. He
thinks the situation is understand
able because "the Palestinian peo
ple have been occupied, persecut
ed and oppressed lor decades."
In sum, the two leading candi
dates find themselves together at
the ideological center in matters
of foreign polic\ as the election
nears.
I lies both possess optimistic
perspectives of globalization, re
lied ed dillerenllv in their policies
and beliefs.
In contrast, Nader and
Hue hanan, who differ radicallv on
most issues, are on the foreign
policv outskirts. I hey seek to use
America's resources for the coun
try's own benefit.
