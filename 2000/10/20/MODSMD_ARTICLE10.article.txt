Senate approves
naturalization bill for
disabled immigrants
WASIII NGK )N (AP) — The Senate gave final,
unanimous congressional approval yesterday to legisla
tion allowing disabled immigrants to become citizens
without taking an oath of allegiance.
President C llinton supports the bill that would open
the door to citizenship to an estimated 1.000 immi
grants a year whose disabilities prevent them from
reciting the oath, including Yijai Rajan, a ( aliloi nia
woman with cerebral palsy whose c ase spurred action
on the bill.
Legal permanent residents receive government ben
efits while awaiting citizenship. Relatives of the disabled
say they seek citizenship for peace of mind that the im
migrant will be allowed to remain in the country after
their caretakers die.
Knight commission mem
bers hear from critics of
college sports
WASHINGTON —At its first meeting, the reconsti
tuted Knight Foundation Commission on Intercolle
giate Athletics heard reports about the good side of col
lege sports. On Wednesday, the panel got an earful
about the other side.
The group invited some of the most outspoken crit
ics of the collegiate athletics system to present their
c ases for c hange, and they offered a bewildering array
of problems and solutions. All of the speakers called for
stronger measures to maintain higher academic stan
dards for athletes, and most of them included some
time-worn proposals lot reform, such as making lirst
year students ineligible for varsity competition again.
Hut the strongest theme of the Knight Commission's
second session was the need for an umbrella group of
universities, such as the Association of American Uni
versities, to take an active role in cleaning up college
athletics.
