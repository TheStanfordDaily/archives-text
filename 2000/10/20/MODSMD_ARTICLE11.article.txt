On October 20, 1986, The Daily report
ed on the entrepreneurial spirit ola Stan
lord graduate.
"You've probably seen people wearing
them around campus if you don't already
own a pair of the stylish boxer shorts your
self.
" 'Bottom Drawers,' the funky 1 loya
boxer shorts that feature repeat-patterns
of university logos, have taken the country
by storm since they were first introduced
to Georgetown University last spring. . . .
"The idea for the shorts originated in
the heads ol Michael Dickerson, Stanford
Class of 1985, and Charlie Green, Swai n
mote Class ol 1985 .... Richard Geist,
Stanford Class of 1986, a friend ol Dicker
son and a new associate ol College Con
cepts, said the men were looking lor a
company that would roll the letters on the
cotton cloth panel, rather than the usual
method of screen printing them. . . .
"Geisi headed Don lit Delivery, a cater
ing service. I fe was also the financial man
ager of his 112 raternity, Kappa Alpha, and
was in charge of the Sunday Flicks.
"Green was an intern at the United
States Senate."
Bottom line: From Donut Delivery to a Stanford
degree to boxer shorts. Never underestimate
the varied path your life can take.
