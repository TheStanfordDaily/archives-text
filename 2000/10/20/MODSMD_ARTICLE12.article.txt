The next Mars rover, set for
launch in 2003, probably wont be a
robot with touchy-feely fingers. But
Allison M. Okamura, a mechanical
engineer at Johns Hopkins Universi
ty, figures her work on artificial
touch will be ready to help NASA ex
plore Mars by 2005.
Robots that can feel shapes and
textures could provide important sci
entific information while exploring
places where humans cannot tread.
' There has been lots of work on giv
ing robots a sense of touch, so they
can manipulate objects in factories,
but Tm really interested in touch for
exploration,'says Okamura. . . .
Okamura developed her first
robot fingers in the late 1990s while
she was a graduate student at Stan
ford University.
