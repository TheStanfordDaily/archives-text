### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli combat heli

trapped on a rocky West Hank hillside, traded
heavy lire with Palestinian gunmen in a live-hour
shootout yesterda\. I wo people died and at least
IS were wounded.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak declared ii a
"gross violation" of a truce announced two days
earlier. Both the Palestinians and the Israelis said
the other side lired first.
1 he settlers said Palestinian gunmen started
the battle, but the Palestinians claimed the settleis
fired first on unarmed olive pickers.
The firelight amid the barren rocks of Mount
Ebal, overlooking the West Bank town of Nablus,
came on the eve of a Friday deadline imposed In
both sides lor ending three weeks of violence that
has left more than 100 dead, the vast majority
Palestinians.
1 he dead were a Palestinian and an Israeli set
tler. Rabbi Binyamin filing, f>4, head of a rabbini
cal college in the settlement of Eilon Moreli. He
bled to death awaiting rescue.
l lie wounded included 15 Palestinians and at
least three Israelis, according to Palestinian doc
tors <ind Israeli security officials.
" fhis is a very grave incident and a gross viola
tion by the Palestinian Authority, Barak said in a
statement issued after the battle ended and the set
tlers were evacuated.
I he shootout appeared to be a serious threat n>
the deal announced Tuesday at a Mideast summit in
Egvpt. where President Clinton read a statement sav
ing that both sides would work to stop the violence.
frouble broke out when about 10 Jewish sci
tiers tried to travel to the hillside to observe
Joseph's I omb, a holy site in Nablus recentlv ran
sacked bv a Palestinian mob.
Despite a military ban on tours, the settlers
received army permission lor their excursion, said
Maj. (ien. Yit/hak Eitan, the regional commander.
He called it a "grave error" bv the army and said
it would be investigated.
l lie settlers came under lire from a Palestinian
refugee camp, and Israeli helicopter gunships
soon joined the fray in an attempt to protect some
10 settlers, including women and children, and
evacuate the wounded, according to Israelis.
Two helicopters hovered, unleashing machine
gun lire on Palestinians darting lor cover behind
the huge stones on a mountain nicknamed the
"accursed mountain" lor its stark landscape. Pales
tinians returned antiaircraft lire, a lirst in the loin -
week conflict.
l lie settlers scattered across the hillside, mak
ing it difficult lor the Israeli forces to reach all of
those trapped. Several of the wounded Israelis
could not be evacuated immediately due to the
heavy Palestinian fire.
Both Israeli television stations broadcast non
stop coverage of the gunlight, running footage
(aught at its outbreak repeatedly and maintaining
phone contact with the settlers. One settler,
pinned down by the gunfire, was interviewed on

his cellular telephone In Israel's ( liannel 2 TV.
"I nder lire lor live hours straight," said Ela/ar
Mi/.rahi, the staccato of automatic lire audible in
the background. "There are still gunshots. Hid
ing. Others meters from me. We came to tour
the area. I'm hiding behind a rock. I can't leave
here."
I'he battle died out aftci dark, while Israel
moved tanks and armored personnel carriers to the
outskirts ol Nablus. 1 .inks had been moved awav
jnst a day earlier in an ellort to reduce tensions.
Nablus has remained extremelv tense despite
the military's withdrawal from the holy site. The
settlers have vowed to return to the tomb, though
it is in the middle ol the restive Palestinian city.
After the truce was announced in Egypt, the
two sides agreed Wednesdav to wait IS hours,
until around midda\ today , to determine whether
it was working.
" I'he drop in the level ol activity of the Pales
tinians is not enough and does not satisfy us,"
Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Such said on
Army radio. "We are halfwa\ through the period
and when it is over (todav) we will decide what to
do next."
