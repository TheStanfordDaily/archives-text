### 
GKNKVA (AP) â€” The lop U.N. human rights
body voted yesterday to condemn Israel for
"widespread, systematic and gross violations of
human rights" and set up an international inquiry
into violence in tlie West Bank and Gaza.
Nineteen nations approved the resolution put
forward by Arab nations. 1 lie United States and 15
others opposed it, while 17 abstained.
1 he resolution approved by a special session of
the U.N. Human Rights Commission strongly con
demned "the indiscriminate use of force in violation
of international humanitarian law by the Israeli
occupying power" during recent outbreaks of vio
lence in the Palestinian territories.
1 he United States abstained from an Oct. 7 Secu
rity Council vote that approved a similar resolution
condemning the "excessive use of force."
Israeli Ambassador Yaakov Lev) attacked the
measure as "partisan, one sided and inflammatory."
Me said it contains "such violent language that it
is bound to further tensions on the ground."
Palestinian representative N.ibil Kamlawi rejected
the suggestion that the move would damage the
work done at this week's summit in Kgvpt.
"I believe the Israelis themselves do not want

peace," Kamlawi said. "Any action lrom the interna
tional community in supporting the Palestinians in
their struggle against the Israeli occupation can only
help."
l he resolution mandates an international com
mission of inquiry to "gather and compile informa
tion on violations ol human rights" and requests
U.N. High Commissioner lor Human Rights Mary
Robinson to travel to the region urgently to take
stock ol rights violations.
l he text also condemns the "provocative visit"
Sept. 28 by Israel's opposition leader, Ariel Sharon,
to a Jerusalem shrine hol\ to Jews and Muslims. The
violence erupted after that visit.
European countries joined the United States in
voting against the resolution, while African and Latin
American nations were split.
"Ii oilers no pathway to reconciliation among
people who, although on the brink of conflict, were
so recently on the brink of a final peace settlement,"
said U.S. representative Nancy Rubin.
I lie council called for the resumption of peace
talks, backed an inquiry into the fighting and said it
deplored the provocation of Sharon's trip to the dis
puted shrine.
