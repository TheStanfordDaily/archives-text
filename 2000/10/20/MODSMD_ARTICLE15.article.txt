ADKN, Yemen (AP) — A 12-
\oar-old Yemeni boy has lold
investigators that a man paid him
to watch his car, then took to sea
in a small boat and never
returned, providing a ke\ earh
lead in their search for clues about
what happened to the I'SS dole.
Authorities have been focusing
on two men who rented an Aden
apartment where bomb-making
material was later found. I he two
have not been seen since the I .S.
warship was bombed ()ct. 12 .is it
arrived in Aden to refuel, killing
17 sailors'and injuring 'M).
I lie Navy announced yester
day that it recovered the last four
bodies of sailors killed in the blast.
Thirteen bodies had alreadv been
flown to the I nited States, and
the final four will be home soon.
FBI director I.ouis Freeh, in
Yemen for talks with President Ali
Abdullah Saleh, said determining
exacth who carried out the attack
would be a challenge. He said the
crime scene he toured yesterday was
a "tangled mess of metal and wire.

Officials believe two suicide
bombers maneuvered a small boat
packed with explosives next to the
(iole and then detonated it.
Ihe witnesses being ques
tioned include the owner of a
welding shop who did work lor
( the suspects, Yemeni security offi
cials said, speaking on condition
of anonymity. I he landlord of the
apartment and a real estate agent
who found ii lor the men also
have been questioned.
1 he boy told authorities a
bearded man weal ing glasses gave
him small change and told him to
watch his car near the port on the
(lav of the bombing, Saleh said
Wednesday on the Arab satellite
news station Al-Jazeera.
According to the boy, the man
then went to sea in a small boat lie
carried atop the car and did not
return, Saleh said. Yemeni police
apparently were able to trace the
man to the Aden apartment.
Yemeni security officials said
yesterday the apartment yielded
documents they believe originat-

Ed in Ifadhramaut, a region
along the eastern border with
Oman that is home to lawless
tribes that have kidnapped for
eigners for ransom.
A vehicle believed to have been
used by the attackers also con
tained documents traced to
I ladhramaut, the Yemeni officials
said. They said investigators were
sent to ilie region yesterday.
Yemeni officials said another
team ol investigators was going to
neighboring Saudi Arabia yester
day. Many Yemenis from
1 ladhramaut have settled there.
There has been no claim of
responsibility for the Cole bomb
ing that is considered credible.
Saleh, in an interview with
C.NN yesterday, said "ii could be"
when asked if Saudi dissident
Osama bin Laden — whom the
United States accuses of master
minding the 1 998 bombings of its
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
that killed 224 people — was
behind the attack on the USS
Cole.
