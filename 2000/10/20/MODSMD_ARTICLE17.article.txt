## The 						Stanford Daily Campus activism doesn't deserve its bad rap 
### 
Published Since 1891

CONTRARY TO THE convention
al wisdom, campus activism is far
from dead. Last spring, Stanford
students organized a march in
support of the Service Employees Interna
tional Union Local 1877 as part of the
"Justice For Janitors" campaign. In addi
tion, last weekend the ASSU sponsored the
fourth-annual activism workshop, which
addressed how students can organize
strategically, build communities and edu
cate the population about issues.
So why does "activism" get such a bad
rap at Stanford? Perhaps because the term
often evokes images of extremism, which
make people reticent to label themselves or
be labeled an "activist."
By definition, activism emphasizes
direct, vigorous action, especially in sup
port of or opposition to one side of a con-

troversial issue.
Many of us subscribe to the pervasive
stereotype that a person must have an
absolutist opinion on an issue before artic
ulating his or her feelings. Vet activism is
not about preaching an unwavering
stance, rather it involves both working to
educate people about issues and asserting
our individual and communal needs to
somehow improve our present condition.
Although many students engage in some
sort of social improvement work, most
remain hesitant to debate issues or embroil
themselves in potential controversy. Per
haps Stanford's mellow campus culture
and "don't rock the boat" mentality is
responsible for the perceived disparity
between voluntarism and activism.
Significantly, this weekend's workshop
highlighted both that activism is a learn

ing process and that education is achieved
through action, highlighting that these
two forms of activity are hardly mutually
exclusive. Instead, they are intimately
related.
Certainly, you don't have to hand out
flyers or yell out of a megaphone to make
a difference. You only have to care enough
to act in some way. Whether that means
protesting in White Plaza or simply
explaining your viewpoint on an issue to a
friend over breakfast is up to you.
As the adage goes: if you don't stand for
something, you'll fall for anything. So
believe in something. Convince others that
you are right or challenge them to prove
you wrong. And, remember, you always
have the right to change your opinion.
Activists seek to educate people and, in
doing so, to build caring, involved and

A community does not, and should not,
have to be homogenous. At Stanford, we
can be simultaneously unified and dis
tinct: unified as students in search of a
greater good; distinct as individuals with
unique backgrounds and perspectives. We
do. however, have to be willing to learn
from each other. That is the essence of
activism.
The ASSU activism workshop showed us
how to better address the issues that per
vade our community. The Justice for Jani

demonstrate real support for an important
issue.
Ask your questions. Speak your truths.
We are all potential activists because we all
cherish certain beliefs. But we need to
revamp our stereotypes first.
