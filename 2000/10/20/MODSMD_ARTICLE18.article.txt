# SALAD DAYS
## A 						lesson in maturity 
### 
If you've forgotten what it was like
to live without carrying the load
of maturity and wisdom on your
shoulders, talk to a freshman.
You might learn few things. 1 did.
The other day I went out and
played some Frisbee golf with my
dorm. 1 live in Soto, which is a four
class dorm. I'm a junior. Most of the
Frisbee players were frosh.
What was 1 doing playing Frisbee
golf with a bunch of frosh? The only
other junior on this midnight excur
sion was the Resident Assistant My
mature and wise upperclassmen
friends were studying somewhere. The
frosh were bouncing around scream
ing and hitting each other with their
flying discs.
Was I just a wise old man along for
the ride?
No. I was bouncing around scream
ing and hitting other people with my
flying disc. It was great. It was sponta
neous. 1 felt like a kid. Can you imag
ine? A weathered and wizened 20-year
old feeling like a kid?
Frankly, I don't feel like a kid often
enough.
A friend of mine actually asked me,
"How are the children?" referring to
my life with freshman in a four-class
dorm. That seems to be the dominant
ethic on campus: A freshman is an 18
year-old child and a sophomore is a 19
year-old adult. It seems like there is an
amount of maturity and wisdom that
we, as upperclassmen, possess which
freshman don't.
I'm not so sure.
According to Webster:
Maturity: having completed natural
growth and development.
Wisdom: marked by deep under
standing, keen discernment and a
capacity for sound judgment.
Are we really blessed with these
qualities in a way that freshmen aren't?
Surely I haven't completed my natu
ral growth and development. In fact, I
would argue that President Hennessy
hasn't completed his natural growth
and development. Development con
tinues as long as we live.
And as for wisdom, we always think
we get wiser as we get older. Just imag
ine yourself a year ago. See how much
wiser you are now than you were then?
And if you ate wiser now than you
were at 18, it follows logically that you

are wiser than most 18-year-olds.
It all sounds fishy to me. Almost
everyone on the planet thinks that he
has more wisdom than he used to.
You might he looking hack on vour
salad days (green, fresh, new, youth
ful) as a freshman. You've come a long
way, baby. 1 certainly rest easier at
night thinking that I'm at the pinnacle
of my wisdom. It's a comforting
thought that our levels of wisdom and
maturity define an ever-upward-slop
ing curve. I've learned to be suspi
cious of any set of beliefs so blatantly
self-serving.
These definitions can't describe a
curve with any real meaning. How can
we place upperclassmen above Iresh
men when we are stuck in the same
predictable activities, and they are hav
ing fun and exploring new possibili
ties? The only way lot us to secure our
selves a place above freshmen is to
change the meaning of Our terms.
1 propose two new definitions for
wisdom and maturity, ones that jive
with reality:
Maturity: when your lift- has become
utterly predictable.
Wisdom: something you had less of
when you were younger and will have
more of when you're older.
Using these two new definitions, it is
now possible to say that upperclassmen
are wiser and more mature than fresh
men. Upperclassmen have majors they
are committed to, a relatively static
group of friends and an entrenched
daily routine. Freshmen do not. Fresh
men go out and play Frisbee golf at
midnight. Spontaneity is the opposite of
maturity in this sense.
Wisdom, under the new definition,
is also clearly present in greater quan
tities among upperclassmen. The way
to gain true wisdom, in this sense, is to
get older. Using my definition of wis
dom. we upperclassmen can now truly
say we have more of it than freshmen.
Quite an achievement, 1 would say.
So if you're an upperclassman (or
even older) and you're feeling like
your maturity and wisdom have
eclipsed your youth and zeal for explo
ration, take a look at the freshmen.
Maturity? Who needs it.
Wisdom? Maybe tomorrow.
