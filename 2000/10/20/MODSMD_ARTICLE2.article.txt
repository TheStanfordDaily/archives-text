# Plan under scrutiny
## 
### GREG BRAZEAL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At a packed meeting of the
Santa Clara County Planning
Commission Wednesday night,
supporters of Stanford's 10-year
development plan squared off
against open space advocates
over the future of the Foothills.
Concerned students, commu
nity members and environmental
groups reaffirmed their commit
ment to permanent open space
protection despite the Universi
ty's offer to set aside the Foothills
from development for 25 years.
"The vast majority of the peo
ple iu this community, the Stan
ford community, all the commu
nities around Stanford would like
to see permanent protection of
open space," argued Stanford
Open Space Alliance spokesman
Peter Prekmeier.
Defenders of the University's
plan argued that it was impossi
ble to predict whether develop
ment of open spaces might some
day be necessary, and Stanford
Director of Government and
Community Relations Larry
Horton insisted that the Univer
sity's 25-year offer was more than
reasonable.
"We at Stanford want to be
able to continue to use Stanford
lands for the purposes for which
they were given in trust over a
century ago: to support the edu
cational mission of the Universi
ty," 1 lorton said.

The Alliance claims i<> have
collected more than 15,000 sig
natures in support of permanent
open-space preservation, but
some defenders of Stanford's
proposal dismissed the environ
mentalists as an unrepresenta
tive, vocal minority.
One Palo Alto resident com
pared the current debate to the
controversy in 1997 over devel
opment along Sand Hill Road,
where the popular Stanford West
apartments recently opened.
Drekmeier and many environ
mentalists opposed the project,
but development went ahead
after supporters won a vote in
Palo Alto.
ASS I President Seth Newton,
a senior, insisted that students
are not apathetic about the Uni
versity's land-use policies, point
ing to a rally Oct. 1 1 when an es
timated 200 students hiked to I he-
Dish at midnight in protest of <i
recently imposed 7 p.m. curfew
on the area.
"The vision being articulated
by students . . . does not priori
tize Stanford's freedom to devel
op such as it pleases," Newton
said, "but rather prioritizes hous
ing, makes a strong commitment
to open space and allows reason
able access to the Stanford com
munity while allowing Stanford
plenty of room to build."
Wednesday's hearing was the
last forum for public comments

on the plan before County Su
pervise Joe Simitian announces
his decision Oct. 31. Other divi
sive issues frequently raised at the
hearing included the linkage of
academic development to hous
ing and future access to the Dish
area of the Foothills.
Several supporters of Stan
ford's plan argued that rigidly
linking academic growth to the
construction of new housing
could threaten the University's
academic mission and impede
valuable research. Morton point
ed to the controversies that al

most always surround new hous
ing projects in the Bay Area and
said that, while Stanford sup
ports linkage in general, the link
age recommended by the coun
ty's planning staff was too strong.
"We request that the housing
linkage requirement be revised,"
Horton said, "... to ensure that
requirements placed on Stanford
are related to Stanford's actions,
not the actions of other parties."
Graduate students countered
that without a strong linkage be
tween academic and residential
development, there would be no
guarantee that Stanford would
fulfill its promise to create 2,000
new housing units for students
over the next 10 years.
Palo Alto Director of Planning

Ed Gawl noted that Palo Alto's
recommendations differ from
the county planning stall's re
port by suggesting thai the goll
course and the Lathrop District
should be grouped with open
spaces outside the boundary lor
academic growth. The c il \ s rec
ommendations will be discussed
in more deptli at a counc il meet
ing Monday.
The debate over Stanford's
development plans ma\ soon
draw to a close after Santa Clara
County's Board of Supervisors
presents the University with .1
modified General Use Permit on
Oct. 30. The announcement will
take place at 7 p.m. in the Board
of Supervisors Chambers, 70
