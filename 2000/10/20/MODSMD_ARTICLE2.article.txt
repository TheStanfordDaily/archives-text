# Plan under scrutiny
## 
### GREG BRAZEAL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At a packed meeting of the
Santa Clara County Planning
Commission Wednesday night,
supporters of Stanford's 10-year
development plan squared off
against open space advocates
over the future of the Foothills.
Concerned students, commu
nity members and environmental
groups reaffirmed their commit
ment to permanent open space
protection despite the Universi
ty's offer to set aside the Foothills
from development for 25 years.
"The vast majority of the peo
ple iu this community, the Stan
ford community, all the commu
nities around Stanford would like
to see permanent protection of
open space," argued Stanford
Open Space Alliance spokesman
Peter Prekmeier.
Defenders of the University's
plan argued that it was impossi
ble to predict whether develop
ment of open spaces might some
day be necessary, and Stanford
Director of Government and
Community Relations Larry
Horton insisted that the Univer
sity's 25-year offer was more than
reasonable.
"We at Stanford want to be
able to continue to use Stanford
lands for the purposes for which
they were given in trust over a
century ago: to support the edu
cational mission of the Universi
ty," 1 lorton said.

The Alliance claims i<> have
collected more than 15,000 sig
natures in support of permanent
open-space preservation, but
some defenders of Stanford's
proposal dismissed the environ
mentalists as an unrepresenta
tive, vocal minority.
One Palo Alto resident com
pared the current debate to the
controversy in 1997 over devel
opment along Sand Hill Road,
where the popular Stanford West
apartments recently opened.
Drekmeier and many environ
mentalists opposed the project,
but development went ahead
after supporters won a vote in
Palo Alto.
ASS I President Seth Newton,
a senior, insisted that students
are not apathetic about the Uni
versity's land-use policies, point
ing to a rally Oct. 1 1 when an es
timated 200 students hiked to I he-
Dish at midnight in protest of <i
recently imposed 7 p.m. curfew
on the area.
"The vision being articulated
by students . . . does not priori
tize Stanford's freedom to devel
op such as it pleases," Newton
said, "but rather prioritizes hous
ing, makes a strong commitment
to open space and allows reason
able access to the Stanford com
munity while allowing Stanford
plenty of room to build."
Wednesday's hearing was the
last forum for public comments
