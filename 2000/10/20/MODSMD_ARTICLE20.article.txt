Sustainable development necessary
to Land Use Plan
We are in the 11th hour of a priceless
opportunity to ensure that Stanford
develops sustainably over the next 10
years. Sadly, Stanford's request to devel
op the campus by 35 percent lacks envi
ronmental mitigation. How can they
ignore the fact that 15,000 students, fat
uity and community members have
signed a petition in favor of permanent
protection of the Foothills?!
Please, come out to meetings this
month and call upon the Board of Super
visors to make Stanford's plan sustain
able. Let them know that a permanent
growth boundary must be set so that
Stanford will develop based on long-term
planning instead of short-term needs. In
conjunction, the Foothills must be explic
itly designated as permanent open space.
Where will Stanford build if they do
this? Stanford has plenty of land on cam
pus in the Arboretum between El Camino
and Campus Drive which is full of non
native eucalyptus trees. This is an excel
lent area to develop because it is cut off
from the greenbelt, does not provide sig
nificant habitat and is not used recre
ationally.
Building here would concentrate
development, provide better integration

of mass transit and help to meet a "no
net-new-commute-trips" policy. Plus, by
tapping into the wisdom that makes Stan
ford world-renowned, I'm confident that
a building design can be achieved so that
Stanford will not lose its majestic presence
at the entrance of campus.
Help set a precedent in Santa Clara
County that sustainable development
isn't an option but a necessity for creating
a healthy and vibrant Silicon Valley.

Supervisors should limit
Stanford's growth
There have been numerous communi
ty hearings about the Stanford Land Use
Plan over the past year. I want to encour
age all agencies involved to continue the
work of moving toward preserving the
Foothills as well as sound building plans
that consider daily population flow and
traffic congestion - in short, the quality of
living in this environment.
Sharing a common border with Stan
ford is a challenge because it is a univer
sity alive with many ac tivities for which I
am grateful. However, the University
behaves as if everyone around should

continue to support their every move. A
significant number ol'people, along with
Supervisor Joe Simitian, who have given
generously of their time and energy,
have awakened all of us to this "institu
tional sprawl" and the appetite of the
University.
1 encourage the County Board of
Supervisors to vote in lavoi ol limiting
the University's growth and preserving
the Foothills forever!
