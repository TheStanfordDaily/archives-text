With ihe recent implementation of the new Lead
ership for the Commons program, Stanford students
now have the opportunity to learn specific leadership
skills through intimate discussions, talks, retreats and
other small gatherings.
Leadership for the Commons is an intensive year
long program designed by the Haas Center to pro
vide Stanford students with the leadership skills nec
essary for their present situation at school and for
their future endeavors.
Cathy Avila, the Haas Center student develop
ment program coordinator, said she hopes the pro
gram will empower participating students to use
their leadership skills to better serve the well-being
and interests of the common good through public
service.
The program has a special emphasis on develop
ing leadership skills using a social change model and
is geared to attract participants who wish to assess
and improve on their leadership skills.
"The participants will be able to learn the me
chanics and how-tos of leadership," said Avila. "We
want to help them become an effective leader in
whatever they wish to accomplish."
According to Avila, the idea for the program had
been slowly developed over the past couple of years
at the Haas Center before she, the service learning
team and student stall helped put together a concrete
plan. As a result of positive student feedback, the

team decided to carry out a pilot version oi Leader
ship for the Commons this year.
"This program will enable students to develop
into leaders who know how to work with each other,
said sophomore Michelle Leung, one of the Haas
Center student staff members who helped organize
the program.
"My hope for the program is to provide students
with the skills and the resources to help them figure
out how to organize large projects and make change
within their service area," Avila said.
Sophomore Whitney Metzger, who is currently
participating, is optimistic about the program.
"I hope that Leadership lor the Commons will
make me more aware of the opportunities that pub
lic service presents for me," Metzger said.
Although tlie program had its orientation ses
sion on Wednesday and will host a leadership dis
cussion with Sen. John Glenn tomorrow, the
group will continue to accept students. However,
anyone interested in the program should sign up
as soon as possible.
The program asks its students to participate in all
of the activities that are on the schedule. All partici
pants are also required to attend one course or semi
nar that instructs them in public service.
The schedule includes an all-day leadership re
treat, interactions with various Stanford alumni and
several discussions with qualified individuals includ
ing Glenn, John and Tasha Morgridge — founders
of Cisco Systems — and University President John
Hennessy.
