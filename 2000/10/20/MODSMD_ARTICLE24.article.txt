# Volunteers in Asia promotes Trans-Pacific cultural understanding
## 
### TONYA AVILA 
After 37 years <112 existence. Volunteers
in Asia, originallyistablished at Stanford,
still strives to fulfil its original goal of pro
moting an understanding of cultures
across the Pacific
fhe private, non-profit organization
sends recent grduates to teach English
for one to two \2ars in either China, In
donesia, Laos <r Vietnam and offers a
summer teachiig program for com inn
ing undergradiates.
"Stanford Dan Dwight Clark initiated
the Volunteersui Asia program after rec
ognizing a neet for volunteers to work in
Hong Kong refugee camps," said VIA
Project Coordaator Darlene Damm.
Since then,VlA has expanded its ser
vices significaitly. In 1977, Japanese stu
dents came t< visit Stanford, initiating a
student-exchaige program. Currently,
VIA is expanling its services to a wider
range of Asiat populations.
"We're developing more volunteer
posts that sere people in Asia with less ac
cess to resources, including a school for

the handicappd in China, an orphanage
for ethnic miorities in Laos, poverty al
leviation proicts in Vietnam and an en
vironmentabrotection group in Indone
sia," explairsd Executive Director Cliff
Chan.
Now Vlv organizes more than four
different rans-Pacific Exchange Pro
grams, wbre Asian university students
are hoste. oti the Stanford campus to
study a viiety of subjects such as "Amer
ican Scx Jty" and "Business and Ameri
can 1 Ic.iJi Care."
One of these programs, the Treat
Cross-Ultural Fellowship, brings uni
versity students from Singapore and
|apanor two weeks eacli to experience
Amerian culture and life at Stanford. A
team >i eight Stanford undergraduates
prepfe for the students' visits during the
acadmic year and in early September
visit Vsians students in their respective
coutries.
lecause VIA has incorporated a cross
culiral exchange, the organization is
n<y changing its name. VIA will no
loger be an acronym, but the organiza

tion's official name. The group's leaders
feel that "Via," meaning the way or
through, is a more appropriate name for
t he organization's many intercultural
programs.
VIA is a unique exchange program
and teaching service because of its non
affiliation with any government or reli
gious organization, according to Chan.
"Teachers and exchange students are
warmly welcomed since participants are
not imposing American values and taking
away jobs from Asian c itizens," Chan said.
According to Chan, English is essential
in Asian countries, because there is no
common Asian language. VIA teachers
provide students the opportunity to prac
tice their English speaking skills with a
native speaker, an invaluable experience
that cannot be gained from a textbook.
"In Asia there is a huge need to be lit
erate and speak English because it is the
intercommunication of all commerce and
diplomacy," Chan said.
The one-or two-year English teaching
program also allows for the "exchange of
ideas and the opportunity to share

knowledge between the two cultures,"
Chan explained.
The organization emphasizes cultural
education for both groups of students.
Sophomore Karen Yoo, who spent this
past summer in Vietnam, greatly enjoyed
the exchange of international ideas and
values.
"I believe that communication is so im
portant, especially across borders," Yoo
said. "It opens you up to new perspectives
and enables you to look at things differ
ently, even questioningly."
In addition to fostering relationships
with Asian university students, VIA chal
lenges its students to understand and ex
perience a very different lifestyle.
"[lt is important for students] to gain
empathy by walking in someone else's
shoes and respect a different point of
view, which is [useful in lostering positive]
cultural relations in America," Chan said.
VIA teachers also teach government
off icials in Vietnam and some of the best
research universities in Asia. Thus, their
services assist the countries' abilities to
communicate at an international level as

well as a domestic level.
Because no knowledge of Asia or an
Asian language is required to participate
in the program, VIA selects its volunteers
.ind teachers from a rather large pool of
Stanford and Bay Area students.
"Some students have taken classes on
Asia, others know nothing about it at all,
while others are seeking to explore their
heritage," said Damm.
Regardless of the amount of familiari
ty of Asian cultures, the VIA experience
creates a new awareness for all participat
ing students on either side of the Pacific
Ocean. Experiencing a different life per
spective is only one of the many motiva
tions for students to volunteer for the
Trans-Pacific Exchange Programs and
teaching positions.
"I chose to go to Vietnam because of
my interest in its history and culture,"
Yoo said. "I come from a family back
ground still deeply rooted in Asia — my
parents are Korean, but Japan is my
home — but Southeast Asia was to be a
completely new, eye-opening experience
for me."
