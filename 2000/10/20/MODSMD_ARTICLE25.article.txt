### KIMBERLY DOWNS EDITORIAL STAFF 
While most students are sleeping Sunday
morning, members of the Kappa Alpha Theta
sorority will be busy coordinating the largest
yearly student-run fund-raising event held on
campus.
The 14th-annual Theta Breakers 5K
run/walk and l()k race will raise funds for
Child Advocates of San Mateo and Santa Clara
Counties, a member of the national Court Ap
pointed Special Advocates Association.
Child Advocates is a non-profit agency serv
ing abused and neglected children who are at
risk of becoming lost in an over-burdened court
system.
The agency trains volunteers, who advocate
for and work one-on-one with abused and ne
glected children. Advocates build relationships
with these children and work to ensure that the
court serves tlie children's best interests.

I he money raised on Sunday will go toward
the costs associated with training volunteers to
serve as advocates.
" This event has been a wonderful thing for
us," said Bill Corwin, executive director of Child
Advocates. " The race is not only important as a
fund-raiser, but also as an opportunity to get
more exposure for our organization."
"We are expecting to raise close to $20,000,
but we would like to raise more," said junior
Carolyn Starr, co-organizer of the event along
with senior Amber Johnson.
Entrants can register by themselves or in
groups up to and on the day of the event. En
trance lees are $15 for students and $20 for non
students.
Interested runners should go to Stanford
Stadium at N a.m. on Sunday to register. The
warm-up begins at 8:30 a.m., and the 10K race
starts at 9 a.m. sharp with the 5K run / walk to
follow soon after.
All runners will receive a free T-shirt, food

and beverages. They will also have their fin
ishing time sent to them by mail. Live 105-FM
radio will be there to provide music, and
there will be raffle prizes as well as prizes for
placement.
Almost 700 people participated in Theta
Breakers last year, and the Thetas are expecting
high numbers once again, because the race is
being held during Reunion Homecoming
Weekend 2000.
All alumni received information about the
race in their reunion packets. In addition, one of
the biggest sponsors of the event —Philips
Semiconductors, which gave $10,000 in spon
sorship funds this year in addition to prizes —
plans on sending over 100 of its employees to
participate.
None of the Thetas will compete, because
they will be too busy seeing to organizational de-
