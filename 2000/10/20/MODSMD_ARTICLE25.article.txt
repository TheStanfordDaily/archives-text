## 
### KIMBERLY DOWNS EDITORIAL STAFF 
While most students are sleeping Sunday
morning, members of the Kappa Alpha Theta
sorority will be busy coordinating the largest
yearly student-run fund-raising event held on
campus.
The 14th-annual Theta Breakers 5K
run/walk and l()k race will raise funds for
Child Advocates of San Mateo and Santa Clara
Counties, a member of the national Court Ap
pointed Special Advocates Association.
Child Advocates is a non-profit agency serv
ing abused and neglected children who are at
risk of becoming lost in an over-burdened court
system.
The agency trains volunteers, who advocate
for and work one-on-one with abused and ne
glected children. Advocates build relationships
with these children and work to ensure that the
court serves tlie children's best interests.

I he money raised on Sunday will go toward
the costs associated with training volunteers to
serve as advocates.
" This event has been a wonderful thing for
us," said Bill Corwin, executive director of Child
Advocates. " The race is not only important as a
fund-raiser, but also as an opportunity to get
more exposure for our organization."
"We are expecting to raise close to $20,000,
but we would like to raise more," said junior
Carolyn Starr, co-organizer of the event along
with senior Amber Johnson.
Entrants can register by themselves or in
groups up to and on the day of the event. En
trance lees are $15 for students and $20 for non
students.
Interested runners should go to Stanford
Stadium at N a.m. on Sunday to register. The
warm-up begins at 8:30 a.m., and the 10K race
starts at 9 a.m. sharp with the 5K run / walk to
follow soon after.
All runners will receive a free T-shirt, food

and beverages. They will also have their fin
ishing time sent to them by mail. Live 105-FM
radio will be there to provide music, and
there will be raffle prizes as well as prizes for
placement.
Almost 700 people participated in Theta
Breakers last year, and the Thetas are expecting
high numbers once again, because the race is
being held during Reunion Homecoming
Weekend 2000.
All alumni received information about the
race in their reunion packets. In addition, one of
the biggest sponsors of the event —Philips
Semiconductors, which gave $10,000 in spon
sorship funds this year in addition to prizes —
plans on sending over 100 of its employees to
participate.
None of the Thetas will compete, because
they will be too busy seeing to organizational de-
tails .md cheering oil the race par
ticipants, l)iii oilier fraternities,
sororities and dormitories will have
teams participating in the races. A
team from tlu- Kappa Sigma frater
nity won the iace last year.
Senior Brian Burke, who com
peted on Stanford's track and
cross country teams during his
freshman and sophomore years,
ran in Chela Breakers List year
and plans to do so again tins year
along with members of his frater
nity. Sigma Nil.

"l thought the race would be a
good way to gel the guys in on
something together, especially
since it's a fund-raiser lor a good
cause," Burke said. "So we put to
gether .i team lor the 1 OK and an
other for the f>K, so there are
about 10 ol us who have been
training."
I he Court Appointed Special
Advocates Association is the nation
al philanthropical organization
supported by the Kappa Alpha
llieta sorority, and thus ever)
c haptei puis on some sort of fund
raiser for I hem ea< h year.
Stanford I betas get spec ial
recognition, however, as Theia
Breakers is the most financially lu

crative event held to raise money
lor the association in the nation.
"We have not always been the
best at submitting what we've ac
complished to l lieta Headquar
ters, but since we raise more
money for CI.ASA than any other
chapter, we have been encour
aged to send our results in for for
mal recognition," said Starr. "We
certainly don't do I beta Breakers
for recognition. We just really be
lieve strong!) in the goals of ( '.ASA:
to stop the generational c ycles of
child abuse In training volunteers
to mentor child vic tims of abuse
and /or neglect and to represent
them in court."
Child Advocates used to orga

nize the race, but lor the past three
years the I betas themselves have
been handling all of the fund rais
ing, publicity and race logistic s.
In addition to the race this week
end. the sorority is also actively in
volved m a number of other service
activities. The group's service
chair, sophomore Jessica Pentz, or

in the house (eggs and pancakes)
and then serve at the l : rban Min

"It's great because it gives us a
chance to clo community service
regularly," said Starr.
