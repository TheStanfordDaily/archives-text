## Fasani returns Both Stanford, USC look to snap three-game losing streaks 
### MATT LONG STAFF WRITER 
One highlight of this year's
college fotball season has been
the re-emergence of the Pacific
10 Conference. The Pac-10 leads
all conferences in teams ranked
in the top 25 with five, including
No. 7 Oregon and No. 9 Wash
ington. Yet two teams are sur
prisingly out of the rankings, and
subsequently out of the national
spotlight: Stanford and USC.
Tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. in
Stanford Stadium, the two teams
square off fora chance at re
demption. The winner gets a
chance to move back into bowl
contention; the loser moves clos
er to the Pac-10 basement.
Part of Stanford's recent fall
can be attributed to the absence
of junior quarterback Randy
Tasani, who has been out with a
knee injury for more than a
month. However, a ray of hope
shone through the Cardinal
storm this week when Fasani
was medicallv cleared to play in
tomorrow's game against the
Trojans. W hen Tasani suffered

the injury against Texas Sept.
1(>, most observers thought that
his season might be over, but he
has made an extraordinarily
quick recovery.
Redshirt freshman Chris
Lewis has commanded the Stan
ford offense since Fasani's ab
sence but has struggled to find a
rhythm in the three games he
has started.
"1 thought Chris improved
each week," said Stanford coach
Tyrone Willingham. "But as al
ways, our measuring stick for our
football team is to win the football
game. So, as pleased as 1 am with
his improvement, we still did not
reach the goal."
The game also offers USC(3-3,
0-3 Pac-10) a chance to recover.
TheTrojans opened the season
with three straight victories. After
beating Penn State and Colorado,
they swiftly climbed the polls and
reached as high as No. 8.
The Trojan faithful began to
salivate over a sweet national title
run. But the storied program
dropped even quicker than it had
ascended, losing their opening
three conference games for the
first time since 1957.
The Cardinal (2-4, 1-2) joins
the Trojans in the midst of a three
game fall, and has not played well
since its win over then-No. 5 Texas

Though he suffered a serious kneee injury during this game against
Texas, Sept. 16, junior Randy Fasani will play tommorrow against USC.

on Sept. 16. Saturday's game will
give each of the talented teams a
chance to rebound and save the
season. The winner will have a
chance to vie fora bowl berth,
while the loser will slide further to
ward the Pac-10's gutter.
"The goal is to beat Stanford
and to get back into a bowl race,"
said USC coach Paul Hackett. "We
have to put the others behind us.
We have to hope our younger
guys, as painful as it has been, have
been able to take something from
the six games and say 'alright, now
let's shift gears and find a way to
llip it around.' "
Both teams have extremely
strong receiving corps and rela
tively weak secondaries, so if the
quarterbacks can hit their targets,
they could produce some huge of

fensive numbers. Senior De√üon
nie Pitts has 40 percent of Stan
ford's receptions and leads the
team with five touchdowns. USC
quarterback Carson Palmer
needs to find fellow sophomore
Kareem Kelly, last year's Pac-10
freshman of the year.
Kelly was Lewis's main target
in high school at Long Beach
Poly, where they emerged as two
of the hottest recruits in 1999 and
reached All-American status. The
wideout also stars on the USC
track team in the 100 meters and
is known as the fastest USC foot
ball player ever.
USC's attack is multidimen
sional, with speed at tailback to
complement their passing game.
Sophomore Sultan McCullough
racked up 152 yards against Ore
gon in a 28-17 loss last week,
prompting Oregon coach Mike
Belotti to call him "the fastest tun
ning back, maybe, in the history of
the conference."

The Trojan speed worries
Stanford, especially after last
week's 38-6 loss to No. 18 Oregon
State. The Beavers beat Cardinal
defensive backs deep for touch
downs of 97 and 76 yards.
"The USC running back is one
of the fastest I've ever seen," said
senior linebacker Riall Johnson.
"Palmer has a gun for an arm. We
can't let them break down the side
lines. [()ur secondary] has to keep
their receivers in front of them."
Stanford needs a strong de
fensive front to curb USC's of
fensive arsenal, but the Cardinal
also needs to capitalize on scor
ing opportunities to have a
chance at victory.
"We've tried to win football
games with Chris. He's been
doing all he can but they've been
blitzing and keeping him con
fused," says Johnson. "With
Randy back that won't happen as
much. Hecan't wait to get back on
the field."
