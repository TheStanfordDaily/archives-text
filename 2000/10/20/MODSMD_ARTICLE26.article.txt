## Fasani returns Both Stanford, USC look to snap three-game losing streaks 
### MATT LONG STAFF WRITER 
One highlight of this year's
college fotball season has been
the re-emergence of the Pacific
10 Conference. The Pac-10 leads
all conferences in teams ranked
in the top 25 with five, including
No. 7 Oregon and No. 9 Wash
ington. Yet two teams are sur
prisingly out of the rankings, and
subsequently out of the national
spotlight: Stanford and USC.
Tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. in
Stanford Stadium, the two teams
square off fora chance at re
demption. The winner gets a
chance to move back into bowl
contention; the loser moves clos
er to the Pac-10 basement.
Part of Stanford's recent fall
can be attributed to the absence
of junior quarterback Randy
Tasani, who has been out with a
knee injury for more than a
month. However, a ray of hope
shone through the Cardinal
storm this week when Fasani
was medicallv cleared to play in
tomorrow's game against the
Trojans. W hen Tasani suffered

the injury against Texas Sept.
1(>, most observers thought that
his season might be over, but he
has made an extraordinarily
quick recovery.
Redshirt freshman Chris
Lewis has commanded the Stan
ford offense since Fasani's ab
sence but has struggled to find a
rhythm in the three games he
has started.
"1 thought Chris improved
each week," said Stanford coach
Tyrone Willingham. "But as al
ways, our measuring stick for our
football team is to win the football
game. So, as pleased as 1 am with
his improvement, we still did not
reach the goal."
The game also offers USC(3-3,
0-3 Pac-10) a chance to recover.
TheTrojans opened the season
with three straight victories. After
beating Penn State and Colorado,
they swiftly climbed the polls and
reached as high as No. 8.
The Trojan faithful began to
salivate over a sweet national title
run. But the storied program
dropped even quicker than it had
ascended, losing their opening
three conference games for the
first time since 1957.
The Cardinal (2-4, 1-2) joins
the Trojans in the midst of a three
game fall, and has not played well
since its win over then-No. 5 Texas

Though he suffered a serious kneee injury during this game against
Texas, Sept. 16, junior Randy Fasani will play tommorrow against USC.
