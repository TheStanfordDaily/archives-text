# Card looks for redemption
## 
### ALEX BENJAMIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the last three weeks the second-ranked Stan
lord men's soccer team (11 -1 -1) has enjoyed the lux
ury ol playing at New Maloney Field in front ol loyal
and loving fans. For the next live games the Cardi
nal will hit the road, leaving behind all those com
forts of home.
This weekend's matches against Oregon State and
No. \ Washington will not be an easy start to away
com petition.
Friday's game against ()regon State will provide a
formidable challenge to the (Cardinal. In their first I
games, the Heavers have run up a deceiving (>-(>-1
record with losses coming against highly ranked op
ponents like No. 7 UCLA, 4-1, and the fourth-ranked
Huskies, 1-0. In addition to those two losses, a 1-1 tie
with (California also has the team still searching for its
first Pacific-10 Conference victory.
()regon State has beaten a number of good teams,
including No. H Portland. But with a team consisting
of 12 freshmen and 10 sophomores, it is not surpris
ing that the Beavers have struggled. Still, the strength
of the Pac-10 has the Cardinal ready for anything
come Friday night.
"Theama/.ing thing about the Pac-10 schedule this
year is that all the teams can be beaten on any given

day," said junior Taylor Graham. "But if we play our
stvle of soccer and dictate the game to them, we will be
successful."
Matt Olsen, one of only four returning seniors,
leads the Beavers' offensive attack with lour goals.
Sophomores Justin Kirk and Aaron McHarth and
freshman Josh Elbaum have each added three goals.
At the back, the Beavers must overcome even more
inexperience. Sharing time in goal is a pair ol fresh
men— Peter Billmeyer and Mark Muleady. Billmey
er, who has been in goal most of the minutes, has a
goals-against average 0f0.02, while Muleach has been
less effective, racking up a GAA of 1.78.
II the young Beaver team wins, the (Cardinal's high
ranking will give ()regon State instant national expo
sure. That offers the Beavers, like the rest of Stan
lord's opponents this season, an even bigger reason to
come out firing.
"Playing at home has its advantages — a familiar
field and supportive fans — but we have enough ex
perience on this team that we will be able to do our
business wherever we play," said Stanford senior
Sean Sylvis.

Despite what appears to be a
disadvantage lor the Cardinal,
senior Luke Rust leels that this
stretch ol games on the road
could have a positive effect.
"Cloing on the road will be
good for the team," Rust said. "I
think we're getting a little bit too
comfortable here at home. At the
start of the season, we talked
about not onlv doing the job at
home but getting results on the
road as well. So far we've been on
top of it and hopefully we can
keep rolling."
