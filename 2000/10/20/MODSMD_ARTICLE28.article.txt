For the No. 16 Stanford
women's soccer team, this week
end is a muchwelcomed and
much-needed homecoming.
Alter seven long games on the
road, the Cardinal will finally pla\
two games on its own turf as it faces
unranked Arizona tonight at 7
p.m. and No. 25 Arizona State on
Sunday at 1 p.m. in Pacific 10 Con
ference play.
The last time the Cardinal

victory against Maryland on

record of 1-2-0 against two lower
ranked opponents. Neither game
this weekend is an assured win, but
the Cardinal expects to be victori

"We are hoping to get a couple
of wins," said head coach Andy
Nelson. "We are going in to the
weekend cjuieth confident. But,

game to Washington 2-1.
The Cardinal has not lost a
home game ibis season. In order
