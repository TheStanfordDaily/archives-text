Despite Stanford's low seeding in
the NorCal tournament and its
tough first match, Dettamanti re
mains confident of his team's ability.
Dettamanti calls the Not (al tourna

where you stand and how you're
doing," whereas the Southern ( ali

MPSF tournament, the Cardinal
placed second.
"It's not easy to win this tourna

going to place as well as we can.
We'd always like to win, but when
ever we play we just want to play
good water polo."
