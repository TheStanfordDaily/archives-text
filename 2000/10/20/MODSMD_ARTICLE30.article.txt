collegiate Tournament at the Stanford Golf Course.
The three-round event begins at 8 a.m. The
final round will begin at 8:30 a.m. Sunday with a
shotgun start.
People might think that the having a national
tournament at the No. "> Cardinal's home course
would work to its advantage, however, head coach
(Caroline ()'('.onnor believes the team must be wary.
"We know the course much better than other
teams." said (VConnor, "but its easy to become coin

placent and u> get out of our regular routine.
()' (lonnor believes that si,i\ ing disc iplincd might
be the kt-v lot Stanford this weekend, citingthe Car
dinal's second-plate finish <tithe l.dean Ihlanfeldt
Invitational in Redmond, Wash, two weeks ago as an
example ol good things coming lo those who remain
patient.
"We struggled throughout the lit si two rounds
[111 Washington], but we didn't get frustrated,''
O'Connor said oi the Cardinal, whose solid final
round helped ii jump from fifth lo second-place.
Granted, it is siiil earh in the season and the team
is taking great strides to build a base lor Inline tour-
naments, including the NCAA
Championships in May, an event
in which the Cardinal placed sec
ond last year.
"We're still getting into the
groove of things," senior
Stephanie Keever said about a
Stanford team that has added two
freshmen, Angela Rho and Kim
Kowabunpat. "We're all working
well together already."
Rho's sixth-place finish in
Washington demonstrated that
she can step up and handle the
pressure of collegiate-golf.
O'Connor believed Rho's per
formance to be that of a "sea
soned veteran."
Keever, who shared the indi
vidual title in Washington, is now
the number one women's colle
giate golfer according to the
Golfweek/ Sagarin National Rat
ing System. Keever is joined by
seniors Hilary Homeyer and Jes
sica Belskis on a team that
O'Connor believes to be even bet
ter than last year's.
"We have balance between our
senior leaders and two new top
freshmen," O'Connor said.
"We'll be consistent because it
does not have to be the same per
son everyday who steps up.
Everybody can [put up very low
scores], and that's what makes this
team different than many other
teams in the country."
Not to be overlooked in the
talk of the seniors and freshmen is
the final member of the six-per
son squad, sophomore Kim Row
ton. Rowton, who is still recover
ing from summer knee surgery,
has made her way back into the
competitive arena and will join
Keever, Homeyer, Belskis and
Rho this weekend in the team

competition.
Stanford will demonstrate its
depth on its home course against
IS teams that O'Connor calls
"one oi the strongest fields in the
country.''
1 he lield consists of all I'acilic

10 Conference teams, including
top-ranked Arizona and No.
use.
"We've won out here belore."
O'Connor said, "and a> lar a>. ex
pectations go, 1 would like lobe in
contention on Sunday."
