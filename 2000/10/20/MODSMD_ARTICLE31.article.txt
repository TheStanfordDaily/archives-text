### MINAYO NAISALI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After two weeks of traveling to the Midwest, the
No. 1 Stanford women's cross country team will
spend tomorrow in nearby Belmont, Calif, for the
Crystal Springs Challenge.
Compared to the previous invitationals this sea
son — the Notre Dame Invitational held Oct. 6 in
South Bend, Ind. and the lowa State Memorial
Cross Country Classic on Oct. 14 in Ames, lowa —
Saturday's meet is smaller, with only about 200
runners.
This weekend should prove less challenging than
the lowa meet. In Ames, Stanford fated up against
No. 2 Wisconsin and No. S Brigham Young, among
other teams. At tomorrow's meet, most runners will
be part of club teams, not collegiate teams.
While the level of competition is lower, the course
is no less difficult. I lie Crystal Springs course is as
challenging as the course at lowa State that will also be
run on during the NCAA (lhampionships, Nov. 22.
Because this meet marks the halfway point in the
season and the team is preparing for the Pacific 10
Conference and NCAA Championships, the team
looks fora significant improvement from its recent
performances.
Stanford's second-place finish to BYU List week
was an indicator that the team needed to adjust its
approach. As redshirt junior captain Elena Villar

real described, Stanford's physical shape is prime,
but the team decided that it needed to work on its
mental approach. They realized the key to success is
through focused aggression during races.
"We have a more acute sense of what each indi
vidual must do," said assistant coach Dena Evans.
"VVe now have a better understanding of what it will
take to achieve our season s goals.'
The 'Tre-NCAYs," as the lowa State Classic is
often called, was a positive experience, specifically
because it gave the team insight into the difficulty of
the NCAA course and the level of competition from
other teams. It also highlighted standout perfor
mances like that of Villarreal, who placed Kith over
all with a time of 21 minutes, 37 seconds, and was the
first Stanford runner over the finish line.
"Elena had a very strong finish," Evans said.
"She's a consistent performer."
Said Villarreal, "Although ii was a tough race, I
really appreciated the opportunity to race alongside
the top runners in the country. It was really exciting
to be up front with them throughout the course."
The main benefit of this meet for the Cardinal is
that it gives the team the opportunity to regroup and
reanalyze its strategy against less agressive teams.
Despite the lower level of competition, this invita
tional keeps up the competitive spirit of the team, al
lowing each runner to employ the lessons learned at
the I're-NCAAs and engage new personal racing
strategies.
