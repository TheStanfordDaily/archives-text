Four people sign up 101 lus inaugural tour, and they pile into
Patterson's van (which, incidentally, resembles the Mvsten Ma

( hills and thrills.
They camp at the ruins ol Rust in Parr's house, the man who
confessed to the murders ol seven Bur kit sville children in 1041
murders that were eerily connected to the legend of the Blair

They awake in the morning, having lost five hours of their lives
and Patterson's tapes. ()nce they find the tapes and regroup, they
start having visions and hearing children crying. They discover
strange markings 011 their bodies, and the entire group metamor
phoses into a jumbled mess of paranoia and mistrust.
If you're looking to be spooked by this movie, don't expect to
be. While many movie patrons left "Blair Witch" never to feel the
same way about camping again, viewers of" Book of Shadows" will
leave the theater wondering where the "horror" in ibis supposed
horror film was.
Granted, "Book of Shadows" nurtures the same reaction as
"Blair Witch," in that the audience will struggle to distinguish be
tween what is real and what is in the characters' minds, which is a
smart filmmaking technique. Films that leave the audience asking
questions are more gripping and satisfying than those that reveal
all the skeletons in the closet.

The main characters are ovcr

Several residents take advantage ol the hysteria, marketing the

cluding Jellies Patterson (Jellre\ Donovan), .1 twenty-something
tow nie with a troubled past that in< ludes four years in Shelter (ilen
Mental Health I-acilit\. Patterson begins operating a tour of the sites
in the neai b\ Ibresl assotiated with the Blair Witch legend.
Four people sign up 101 lus inaugural tour, and they pile into
Patterson's van (which, incidentally, resembles the Mvsten Ma
chine from "Scooln-Doo") to head off to the woods lor a night ol
( hills and thrills.
They camp at the ruins ol Rust in Parr's house, the man who
confessed to the murders ol seven Bur kit sville children in 1041
murders that were eerily connected to the legend of the Blair
Witch. Ever the enterprising tourguide, Patterson sets up several
handi-cams in the trees 10 record the events of the night, in (In
spirit of "The Blair Witch Project."
They awake in the morning, having lost five hours of their lives
and Patterson's tapes. ()nce they find the tapes and regroup, they
start having visions and hearing children crying. They discover
strange markings 011 their bodies, and the entire group metamor
phoses into a jumbled mess of paranoia and mistrust.
If you're looking to be spooked by this movie, don't expect to
be. While many movie patrons left "Blair Witch" never to feel the
same way about camping again, viewers of" Book of Shadows" will
leave the theater wondering where the "horror" in ibis supposed
horror film was.
Granted, "Book of Shadows" nurtures the same reaction as
"Blair Witch," in that the audience will struggle to distinguish be
tween what is real and what is in the characters' minds, which is a
smart filmmaking technique. Films that leave the audience asking
questions are more gripping and satisfying than those that reveal
all the skeletons in the closet.
I Icnvever, despite having an in
teresting premise, the movie lails
to deliver. The main c ulprit r I n
believahle c harac ters.
The main characters are ovcr
the-top and, as a result, are diliicnit
to take seriously. Diamond, the
Goth girl, is painliilh interested in
the macabre and tries so ver\ hard
to be a notoriouslv bad girl.
Geerson, the red-haired vixen,
bills herself as .1 witch concerned
with the exploitation <>l Wicc .1 < ul
ture th.it h.is developed in the wake
ol the "Blair Witch" public it\ craze.
Concerns, which, incidentall),
didn't bother her enough to forgo
going on Patterson's kitchv tour.
Parker and R\ ler are the academic s,
initialK interested onh in under
standing the legend, with tlicit piles

ol books, photos and historical doc -
uments.
Despite his sordid past, ratter
sou seems to be the most "real ol
the group and is the only c harac
ter with whom we can really em
pathize amid the hvsteria ol the
latter part ofthe lilin. As a result ol
these characterizations, the wave
ol paranoia that sweeps through
the group is not very convincing.
If you spent your spring break
roaming the woods around Burk
itsville, Mel., this movie is clelinite
1\ lor you. As for ever\body else —
if you can't tolerate die bed c har
acters — Slav at home. ()tbetwise,
"Book ol Shadows: Blair Witch 2"
is a decent I lalloween movie. (()h,
and movie-goers who were
cpieasv during "Blair Witch" will
be pleased to lincl out that the
producers ol "Book ol Shadows
sprung for <1 camera tripod or
two.)
