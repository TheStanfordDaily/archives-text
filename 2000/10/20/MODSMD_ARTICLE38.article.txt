# 'Salome' at once lustful, bloodthirsty... insectoid?

### HILARY BIENSTOCK STAFF WRITER 
My most enduring impression
<>l ilir Sydne) Dance Company's
Salome is ol its beautifully inset -
toid grace. Everything about the
performance reminds me ol
glamorous, lustful, bloodthirsty
mantises and tall, delicate daddy
long-legs spiders — hugs th.it
don't scuttle around so much as
tiptoe delicately through a myste
riously dark world, at once both
beautiful and deadly.
The stage setting consists of
several large wooden hoops that
arch from one side of the stage to
the other, disappearing into
darkness above the proscenium,
looking like the legs of a giant
tarantula. The dancers wear tight
black catsuits that show off their
elegant lines and graceful move
ments, while also highlighting
their long, bug-like limbs.
And the most charismatic of
the leads, Herod and his wife
Herodias, resemble nothing so
much as a pair of self-satisfied
praying mantises, blissfully
happy in their love, Herod not re
alizing that Herodias is only wait

ing until the time is right to sever
a head or two.
The plot ol Salome derives
from a few sentences of the New
Testament. John the Baptist is
imprisoned at the court of King
Herod and Herodias. Herodias
wants John dead, so she invites
her daughter Salome to dam e for
r. a"i

her husband. Salome's sultry
dance so pleases 1 lerod, her lech
erous step-father, that he vows to
give her whatever she wishes in
return, and she demands John
the Baptist's head on a silver plat
ter.
Although the biblical story is
already full of erotic overtones,
choreographer Graeme Murphy
works from Oscar Wilde's ver
sion, which adds even more overt
sexuality. In this retelling,
Herod's court consists of a group
of fawning sex-slaves of both gen
ders who dance with hypnotic
sensuality before collapsing into a

moaning, writhing orgy with
1 lercxl <ii the center. Mnrphy also
includes impassioned duets in
which Salome tries to tempt John
the Baptist, who refuses her ad
vances, and a trio involving I lero
di.is and ;i pair of sadomasochistic
gay lovers.
Though all of Murphy's chore
ography is masterful, he isn't
quite as effective in his portrayals
of truly ardent passion. His style
is better suited to whimsically sen
sual dances, like the introduction
of the court at the very beginning
and the brilliant pas de deux in
troducing Herod and Herodias.
As they cavort around the stage
together, it becomes clear that
Herod is a blithely oblivious
monarch, cognizant only of his
own lusts and desires, and Hero
dias is the one pulling the strings.
Murphy's dramatization of the
ancient story makes sense, and his
dancers seamlessly convey his vi
sion to the audience.

aspect of the performance could
not have been achieved without a
little stage magic. Composer and

and legs. 1 lie overall effect is of
something anyone could learn to
do iu a few hours, given the prop

befit the rest of the performance's

This ant it 1 imad ic dance,

the performance. All the dancers

Oh, if only I could freeze in the air like that. Then I'd be a superstar.
store is very effective, transport
ing the theater to another time
and place with its complex
rhythms and Middle-Kastern
souudiug drums. Occasionally,
he layers on top a human voice,
adding a tinge of drama. I lie
voices are coded to correspond to
the characters — for example,
John the Baptist's music sounds
like the rumbling of a thunder
ous, vengeful god. And the light
ing is similarly well-planned, al
ternating between soft, sensual
semi-darkness and bright, panic
inducing beams.
The special elicits in the final
dance deserve an extra accolade:
Salome dances rapturously with
the head of |o!m the Baptist,
while his bod\ is completely hid

den in the darkness of the stage
behind her. The performance is
both bewitching and perplexing,
leaving a lasting impression .is Sa
lome, coupled with the invisible
joint, floats dreamily oil the
stage.
Unfortunately there's an in
evitable dilemma in the concept
of ret reating Salome as a dance
performance. Ihe story centers
around Salome's dance, which is
more exquisite than anything
I lerod has ever seen. But, in this
performance, all the dancing is
fairly exquisite.
I low, then, to make Salome's
dance that much more inspiring
than any other portion ofthe per
formance?
Murphy tries to solve this
problem l>\ having Salome dan
gle from the ceiling, swinging in
circles above Herod's head. Al
though it's supposed to be a

metaphor lor her superlative
performance, it doesn't produce
the desired effect. Instead of
showcasing her dancing on the
ground, which is indeed impres
sive, Murpln suspends Salome in
mid-air, where all she can do is
pose ineffectually with her arms
and legs. 1 lie overall effect is of
something anyone could learn to
do iu a few hours, given the prop
er equipment, and it does not
befit the rest of the performance's
fine artistry.
This ant it 1 imad ic dance,
though, doesn't detract much
from the overall high quality of
the performance. All the dancers
give stunning performances, dra
matically set to Askill's exotic,
percussive score. Above all, Mur
pln succeeds in showing us life in
Herod's court as sensual, de
praved, decadent and ultimately
dangerous.
