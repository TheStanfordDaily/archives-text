# Intermission Feature
## U.N. Film Festival puts human face on politics Filmmakers speak of aesthetic and political concerns while audience remembers faces 
### CHRISTINA HARVEY STAFF WRITER 
Anita ('.hang says that someone
with artistic interests who lives in
the Hay Area is inevitably bound to
"bump into" filmmakers. 111 her
case, the unexpected collision led
her to a career in documentary
filmmaking and a confrontation
with issues like belonging, inequal
ity, spirituality and choice.
"I came to filmmaking from a
painting, writing, dance and music
background, as well .is .1 strong ac -
tivist background," said San Fran
cisco-based Chang, whose film
"Imagining Place" will be shown at
the third annual United Nations
Association Film festival .it Stan-

lord from yesterday lo Sunday.
"I found that filmmaking
brought together my artistic and
political interests in .1 challenging,
exciting and gratifying way,"
Chang said. "The moving-image
medium becomes a tool lor accen
tuating the complexities of peo
ple's inner and outer worlds. My
films are politically motivated, but
always aesthetically based. Formal
ly, my works place equal pressure
on written, verbal, aural and visual
language to inform audiences,
while experimenting with the doc
umentary Ibrin."
jasmina ttojic, the festival's di
rectoi, had the same integration ol
creativity and global awareness in
mind when she conceptualized
and organized the festival, the first -

ever lo tin us oil international doc
umentary film two years ago.
The non-competitive festival
has no affiliation with the I nited
Nations, hut it screens documen
taries by international filmmakers
dealing with I.N. topics such as
human rights, environmental sur
vival, women's issues, refugee pro
tection, honielessness, racism, dis
ease control, universal education,
wai and peace. According to Bojic,
the festival oilers .1 unique oppor
tunity to hecoine familiar with
global problems as well as view
films that are rarelv screened lor
public audiences because the) are
too political.
" I here was su< ha need lot in
ternational filmmakers to have .1
place to present their work ,md lo

talk about the issues around the
world," said Bojic, a professor in
the (Continuing Studies program at
Stanford who ha* worked as a film
critic for more than 20 years. "This
vear we've got some of the hottest
political issues presented at the fes
tival, films from Yugoslavia, Iraq,
Israel. Really, those are the three
hottest political spots in the world
right now."
The festival received over 100
submissions from all over the
world. Fhe jur\ selected 20 films
from 20 dillerent countries. Main
ol the lilnunakei s will be present at
the festival.
Chang's film, "Imagining
Plate." focuses on topics close to
home. She investigates the ques
tion, "What does belonging led

like in America?" The film speaks
to individuals for whom the ques
tion of belonging is most immedi
ate, such as immigrants, exiles or
individuals who live on the mar
gins because ol phvsical, social and
psychological borders.
" Fhe film was a result ol my not
feeling a sense of belonging and re
all\ wanting to explore this phe
nomenon," said Chang, who
teaches in San Francisco State Uni
versity's Cinema Department. "I
wanted to give viewers a chance to
begin a personal examination of
their own place iu the world and
relied on how their ac tions affect
the world around thetn. I'm glad
that I NAFF felt the lilm was ap

propriate lor their festival because
a sense of belonging is often
controlled by oppressive govern
ments and policies."
Chang said audiences need to
approach her work with an open
mind, .is n is not r,isil\ < ategorized.
"I .mi interested in activel) en
gaging audiences with complex
universal themes through each in
timate revelation of ni\ films' sub
jects,'' she said.
Her film will screen Oct. 22 at
.>: 1 5 p.m.
Benedita <la Silva plavs more
lile-roles than main of us: sliantv
<lwfiler, niothei. domestic worker,
community organi/.er, poet and
now the-firstAfro-Bia/ilian woman
to be elected to Brazil's senate.
I W as Born a Black Woman,"
which premiered at the Lincoln
(Center in New N ork as part of the
Human Rights Watch Interna
tional film festival in June, will
be shown opening night at 10:15
p.m. flic film details da Silva's
rise from the poverty-stricken
lavelas (slums) into Brazilian pol
itics and her success as a woman
of color in w hat she still considers
aw hite man's world.
Da Silva suffered severe racism
at school; in fact, at one poignant

moment in "1 Was Born a Black
Woman,' she recalls how she
often climbed into her mother's
laundry bleach, hoping it would
lighten her skin.
Da Silva gradually gained sta
tus foi hersell and her conununi
t\ through education, her faith in
God and communit\ organizing,
in 1 ( .)52. she was elected to the
Rio de Janeiro Cit\ Council and,
in 1994. she joined the Brazilian
Senate.
"Politics became my life raft
when I wanted to run from life,"
she saws in the film. "I live in a
countn ol :<() million impover
ished people, people who can't
lead or write, people who live in
cardboard shacks in the sliantv
towns, under bridges, on the
streets. I know their stories because
I have lived it myself."
"I Was Born a Black Woman"
is based on tlu- acclaimed biogia
phv, "Bencdita da Silva: An \lro-
Brazilian Woman's Ston of Poli
tics and I .ove.
"Brazil has so mail) visuals, the
music and the dance." said Kit
Miller, the film's producer. "A
book simpl) wasn't able to cap
ture all its beauty, even though it
was quite comprehensive. Also,
the film has a locus on human
rights and race, while the book
was mostly her story."
"I Was Born a Black Woman"

juxtaposes <la Silva many identi
ties, with images of her walking
barefoot through the favela, speak
ing about racism to the senate and
reading her poetry with her face in
profile.
It also highlights many of her
sa< rilie es on the road to success, es
pecialh as they relate to tensions
within her family. For instance, da
Silva's now-grown children half-se
rioush complain that dies need
.mother mother, .is she is too busv
being the mother of all of Brazil.
"We didn't intentionalh plan to
lot us on that, but when you're cov
ei ing a woman doing so una b antl
who has gone so far, you can al
most assume that she's always sac
rificing something of her laniilv."
said Miller. "So us. her kids are a
little bitter. But part ol it was also
povei i\. and she was running after
an education, antl trying to put
food on the table. 1 "be day-to-day
toil ol getting I>\ takes its toll after a
while. But I think even that came
out well. II \ on do an inspirational
lilm, it can become a propaganda
film. Benedita has some ver\ real,
human failings that we were tr\ ing
to bring out, using the personal
comments."
Miller said slit' feels the film has
made a contribution to the interna
tional discussion of race and (In
legacy of slavery.
"It really sheds some light on

the question of race in Brazil," she
said, "because Brazil in some ways
has a deserved reputation for racial
democracy, but at the same time it
remains a very racist society. We
wanted to look at those issues but
show they are not definitive, show
that someone with certain oppor
tunities, drive and good luck can
overcome that racism and become
like a beacon lor others in her situ
ation. It's kind of supposed to be an
upbeat, inspirational film, even
while showing problems that need
correcting."
Problems, da Silva says, which
are due primarily to discrimina
tion, such as the need for clean
water, electricity, sewage, health
care antl education lor Afro-Brazil
ians. According to 11 it- lilm, the idea
that Brazil lacks rat ism is just a
myth. There is a fluidity of race
that doesn't exist in the United
Stales, but police are more likeh to
stop Alro-Brasilians lor no reason,
and black leaders fear being
framed with drugs in their pockets,
tin film savs. Light-skinned people
are encouraged to lie about their
rate, antl the Brazilian elite always
consider themselves white, finally
the lilm contends that Afro-Brazil
ian women are still living a legacy
of slavery.
Miller said participating in the
festival makes all the long hours
worthwhile.

"You get so sic k of the film while
you're doing it, but it's great to
have it afterwards," she said. "And
definitely the real payolf is talking
to these film festival people, and
they want it and they think it is
going to do some good. They think
it's worth something."
This year's opening film is a full
length feat ure,"Well-Founded
fear, In Shari Robertson and
Michael (lamerini. "Weil-Founded
fear" is a story about asylum in
America, about what goes on be
hind dosed doors at the offices of
