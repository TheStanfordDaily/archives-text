demned the physical posturing Stein said

notice, I was pleased [about the
attendance]." said event organiz
er and Stanford Republicans
member Keith Proctor.

eral political issues, including
abortion. Stein is sirictl) pro-life
and referred to abortion as
"killing children." However, he
also professed a belief in helping
discourage abortion, specifically
with tax < ills lor adoptive and sin
gle parents.
Tin an adoptive parent, and
it's the best thing I've done in my
lilt*," he said.
Stein additionallv countered
(lore's criticism ol Bush's tax-cut
policv, staling that these cuts
would not exclusively favor the
i i( 11 and that the wealthy would
Still pax the majority ol taxes.
Stein, who Jewish, professed
confusion oxei the lact that most
