# 'Dark Wave' brings on sinister suprises

### SARAH MEARON STAFF WRITER 
Trick or treat? "Dark Wave,"
the San Francisco Film Society's
showcase of classic and contempo
rary honor flicks, oilers .1 little bit
of both.
In its sophomore year, "Dark
Wave" will include screenings ol
films from Denmark, Japan, (-ana
da, Fngland and the United States.
I he festival will run today through
Sunday at the Roxie Cinema on
16th Street in San Francisco.
Audiences will be transported to
the dank morgue of a Bucharest
Hospital in "Possessed," to the
backwoods of Michigan in "Demon
Lover Diary" and to an abandoned
boarding school, the scene of a
heinous crime 40 years past, in
"The Convent."
Offered as an alternative to the
nauseating assortment of lifeless
horror films born of Hollywood,
Dark Wave seeks to prove that you
don't need Jennifer Love 1 lewitt in
a tube top to make a captivating
thriller.
"Possessed" (Denmark, 1999)
Saturday at 5 p.m. and Sunday at
7:15 p.m.
A power outage and a Molotov

<o( ktail-toting occultist are the cat
alysts in the death of a mysterious
Romanian national soon after he
arrives in (lopenhangen. After the
autopsy reveals F.bola-like symp
toms, an ambitious voung Danish
virologist named Soren (Olc Lem
meke) decides to devote 1 iis time to
deciphering the cause of the man's
infection.
After determining that the man
was infected In a young Romanian
boy, Soren and his girlfriend,
Sarah (Kiisti Fline'lorhaug), head
for Bucharest in search of more
clues. They arrive on the boy's
grieving parents' doorstep and
visit the fresh grave in the back
yard. Soren is bent on getting a
spinal sample from the deceased
and returns under cover of dark
ness to dig up the boy's corpse.
This drives him away from Sarah,
who is disgusted with his actions.
When they return to Denmark,
Soren orders a biopsy of the sam
ple, but the results are not what he
was expecting. We learn that the
strange markings found on the
dead bodies of both the man and
the boy were not related to a virus
of "natural" origins. "Stella Mala,"
a supernova signaling the birth of
Satan, had heralded the beginning
of the end just two weeks before.
Director Anders Ronnow-Klar
lund, in his sophomore feature,

presents a dramatic thriller in a
sensually'-charged st\ It*, lite con
frontational nse of dulled primal)
colors — from muted vellow hotel
room walls to murky red smoke
emanating from .111 underground
passageway — paint a dismal pic
ture of the world, lending cre
dence to the emotions that Soren
projects during his daunting quest.
The use of light, dark, relied ion
and shadow gives the film a
primeval feel, which, coupled with
a haunting score and provocative
cinematography, allow it to pre
sent the cold, oppressive reality of
death and disease. The camera an
gles are claustrophobic, adding to
the fervent, almost psychotic at
mosphere of the film. A triumph of
the banish medical-horror genre,
"Possessed" will leave you contem
plating the vulnerability of hu
mankind to disease, whether nat
ural or supernatural.
"Deathdream" (Canada, 1972)
Sunday at 9:30 p.m.
In the spirit of old-school hor
ror films such as "Night of the Liv
ing Dead" (1968), "Deathdream,"
a.k.a. "Dead of Night," a modest
horror film set in Anytown, U.S.A.,
effectively uses zombie-ism to paint
a haunting portrait of life in small
town America. Sound trite? Well, it

isn t.
When Andy Brooks (Richard
Backus) returns home from light
ing in the jungles of Vietnam, his
family is overjoyed to see him. Es
pecially his mother (Lynn Carlin),
who is relieved that her perfect son
has returned to complete the pic
ture-perfect middle-class family
unit. Soon, though, the town dis
covers several grisly murders and
all-American Andy begins to out
stay his welcome.
Although his father, played by
John Marley, grows more and
more suspicious that the thing that
came home was not really his son,
Andy's mother refuses to believe
that what was once her bouncing
baby boy has become one of the
walking dead. She insists that
"everything is going to be all right."

Alter all, she "won't have it any
other way."
The impact of the film is most
striking when the family doctor
(Henderson Forsythe) hints to
Andy that he knows that Andy is re
sponsible for the murder of a truck
driver on the outskirts of town.
Andy follows the doctor to his
home, kills him and drinks his
blood, all the while shrieking, "I
died for you, Doc — why shouldn't
you return the favor?"
Andy's thirst for human blood is
secondary to the story of the disin
tegration of the Brooks family. Yet
it is his inhumane craving that
serves to highlight the breakdown
of the relationships between hus
band and wife, mother and daugh-
