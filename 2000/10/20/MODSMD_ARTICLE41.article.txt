Maybe if they hadn't ever pro
duced "Bizarre Ride II: The Phar
cyde" â€” maybe then I could say that
"Plain Rap" was anywhere close to
the group's potential. They did turn

out that masterpiece, though, and
so this release is aptly named.
It's unfair to hold them lo the
standards the\ set with their own
previous work when that work in
cludes songs like "Passing Me Bv"
and "Otha Fish" (although I some
times wonder if"( )h Shit" wasn't the
pinnacle of the "Bizarre Ride II").
The group packed an amazing
amount ol fun and energy into
those songs. But this album, from
the production tothe lyrics, just isn't
anywhere near as cool.
Their sophomore effort, "Labin
cabiiualilornia," wasn't as good as
the first album, either. It did, how
ever. feature the production of Der
rick Tatlip" Stewart, as he was still a
member of the group back in old
-( .)7. "Patlip" gave the music a full
feel with a mixture of upbeat sam
ples that "Plain Rap" lacks. I .isteu to

any <>l the tracks oH'of the lirst two
albums and you'll hear more com
plicated music than the group can
produce without him.
Not only are the beats now sim
pler, they are slower as well. Gone
are the davs of the hyper-sounding
schoolboys that made the Pharcyde
so cool back in the day. Remember
reciting "Ya Mama" when you got
all out of breath trying to keep up
with them? No worries on that one
any more.
The lyrics took a hit with Stew
art'sexit.as well. Much ofthe down
to-earth quality the group had
achieved with him in the lineup is
now gone. No more "joke" songs for
this group. 11 it* closest they get to
any of the I'harcyde brand of
humor is in a song called "Blaze,"
which is an ode to marijuana remi
niscent of "Pack the Pipe" on their

lirst album. But, again, way mellow
er than the original.
Now, Stewart wasn't everything.
I 'his Pharcyde still has its patented
llow. and "Plain Rap" is still enjoy
able. It's not like he left behind a bad
trio of rappers.
"Trust," the lead track on the
new album, is still a good song, just
not a particularly innovative one.
Where they used to ignore industry
trends, the group seems to be hop
ping on the slim beats bandwagon
and is thinning out its sound. This
problem is common to "L.A.," the
fourth track, which sounds almost
like a gangster-rap-esque ballad.
The Pharcyde was anything but
gangster on "Return 11."
One song on "Plain Rap" gave
me hope for the band's future.
"World," the final track, is a slick
jazz tune with a spoken-word-in

spired How laced over it. The
message is .1 good one, the har
mony on the chorus doesn't
sound overdone and the lyrics are
interesting. The song also bene
fits from its slower pace instead of
feeling restrained by it.
In a way, the Pharcyde was rap's
Kick St hroeder. They were discov
ered early and thrust into the spot
light at a young age. And, just as
Rick St hroeder is hard to take seri
ously as a cop in "NYPD Blue," the
Pharcyde can be hard to take seri
ously after its adolescence has long
been over.
lit it maybe you should check
them out anyway. Maybe you will
do a better job forgetting their past
and will enjoy "Plain Rap" to its
fullest as an all right rap album. As
is, after all is said and done, I still
found it somewhat enjoyable.
