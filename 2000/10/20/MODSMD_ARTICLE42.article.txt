Slit' is perhaps best known for
having written "Crazy Mary,"
Pearl Jam's hit single off the trib
ute album, "Sweet Relief." That
album — featuring not only Pearl
Jam, but also such early '90s stars
as Evan Dando and Soul Asylum
— also functioned as a fundraiser
for Williams. The previous year,
she had been diagnosed with the

degenerative neurological disor
der multiple sclerosis, and, like
many signed musicians, she
lacked medical insurance.
The disc was a great success,
raising enough money for
Williams' treatment, as well as ex
posing a large number of people
to her music. Unfortunately, her
subsequent albums did not do as
well as the tribute's success might
have predicted. Still. Williams
kept recording, and Atlantic's
"Water to Drink." is her fifth stu
dio album.
Much ol "Drink" is a departure
Irom tilt' folk-rock Williams is best
known for, but she manages to
synthesize various genres ol
music into her own style. For ex
ample, it contains two standards,
"Young at Heart" and "Until the
Real Thing Comes Along," both
of which are rendered faithfully
and beautifully in a classical style.
That the strings are arranged by
veteran arranger Van Dyke Parks
— best known for his work with
the Beach Boys, Little Feet, U2
and Fiona Apple — should come

as no surprise.
Other songs employ similar
techniques, with violins, Wurl
it/.ers, upright bass, organs and
horns along with the acoustic and
electric guitars. "Claude" sounds
like a old dreamy fantasy. The
lullingly seductive title track sam

bas along without a care, and in
"Joy of Love" Williams tells us
that "A joy o! love is a joy for all,"
while singing the soft-spoken tale
of love with her husband, Mark
Olson, formerly of the Jayhawks.
As with most of the songs, not all
of the lyrics are crystal clear, but

(hat merely adds to the impres
sionistic feel of the album.
Not that the folk-rock influ
ence is totally absent. Not in the
lovely stroll of "Light the Lamp
Freddie," whose chorus borrows
from the Beatles's "dry Baby
dry." The countrified opener,
"Grandpa's I fat fin. would not
sound out of place in joni
Mitchell's repertoire. The playful
"Junk," even with of a drop of
Eastern influence, isn't terribh
off the folk-rock track, either.
And in spite* of the lush produc -
tion, Williams' voice remains that
of a folk singer. One could easil\
imagine these songs as folk songs.
"Water to Drink" is one of the
best slower-paced albums to come
out this year, and is a bit reminis
cent of Sarah McLachlan's al
bums. As with McLachlan, one
might complain that the songs
run together a bit. But, also like
those albums, this is one of the
strongest "soft" albums around,
perfect for nights together or in
trospection alone. Or most any
other time, for that matter.
