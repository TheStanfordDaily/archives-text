## 
### ALAN DAGOVITZ 
Stern ilall residents took in more than
jlist lood as they surveyed I heir new dining
hall this week.
The revamped dining hall, which
opened Tuesday, oilers expanded Ibod se
lections in posh surroundings.
Opening night produced gasps and de
light as last year's dingy image ol Stern was
washed away by solt light, tasteful pastel
tiles and accessible drinks.
Some students even left the dining hall
and came back dressed in thfcir best to cel
ebrate t he occasion.
Dining hall employees were grateful for
the overwhelming response.
"Once the staff started working they got
very excited. The positive reactions made
them feel so wonderful,'' said Executive
(ihel Rali Taherian.
Among the changes are a grill / rotis
serie station, a c hat-broiler, a pizza / pasta
station and exhibition-style cooking sta
tions that allow the cooks more efficiency
while inspiring student confidence in the
freshness and quality of the food.
The new layout will facilitate serving
the (iOO students per hour that crowd the
dining hall. Instead of waiting in one line,
students are free to move about from sta
tion to station, which saves both space and

time, according to Housing and Dining
Services officials.
Students expressed great satisfaction
with the new facilities.
"I was skeptical at first,'' said junior
Cristina Gonzalez, a former Stern resi
dent. "I thought people would be influ
enced just by the look, but then I ate here.
I was really pleased."
She might have been even more pleased
had she known that her table was
equipped with DSL access, just one of
many features in the Cyber Gale area of
Stern Dining.

Yes, Cyber Cafe. Students can plug
their laptop computers in at any table or
watch 11 D-TV on a plasma screen while lis
tening to music through hi-fi ceiling
speakers.
Although the Cyber Cafe is not yet up
and running, Stern Dining was opened to
meet the scheduled goal of serv ice by mid

it will be open until 2 a.m. Sunday through
Thursday and untila.m. on Fridays.
