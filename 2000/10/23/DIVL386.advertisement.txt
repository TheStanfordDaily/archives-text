The Dilemma
In spite of traditional values,
our culture romanticizes spon
taneous sex, and the media
plays it up big time. Women are
supposed to be emotionally
"swept away"; men are pre
sumably "overwhelmed" by
powerful hormones. And pre
meditated sex is considered
neither natural nor exciting.
We all want sex to be physically
satisfying and emotionally
fulfilling, to protect our vulner
abilities, and to keep ourselves
healthy. This requires some
forethought, which lands us
smack in a conflict: How can
we simultaneously be "swept
away" and make important
sexual decisions ahead of time?
It is, for example, tough to:
■ Both "lose control" and
know what you do and
don't want
■ Have protected sex if you
don't plan ahead
■ Let the "mood" (or the bot
tled version - alcohol) run the
show, and have no regrets
Ready or Not
Do you want to have sex? With
whom? How far do you want to
go? To decide freely, take an
honest look at your feelings and
social conditioning. Typical
socialization makes many
students think:
■ "I should have had sex by
> 112 \
Sex role stereotypes haven't
changed a whole lot since this
picture of Stanford students was
taken over a century ago.
■ "Sex will get me love" (in
fact, sex and love are not
the same)
■ "Sex is the ultimate way to
express my love" (not
necessarily)
■ "Sex proves my mascu
linity; it makes me feel like
a man"
■ "My pleasure is my only
concern" (true only when
you're alone; otherwise your
partner's pleasure, needs,
and safety - STDs, unplan
ned pregnancy - concern
you both)
■ "I want sex but I don't want
to get involved" (that's sex
with a body, not with a per
son; is there fear of intimacy?)
■ "Having sex proves my
love" (especially when
taught to "save yourself")
■ "Sex will help me keep my
partner"
■ "I just want to please my
partner" (sex is for both
partners' pleasure)
■ "What I wanted was affec
tion, and to be held" (inter
course wasn't what I really
wanted)
All or Nothing?
There is a myth that all students
are sexually active. Physical
intimacy is available on a broad
spectrum, from simple touch to
deep erotic intensity. Think
through and choose what you
are comfortable with.
Sex Under the Influence
Sometimes students drink
alcohol as a way to decrease dis
comfort about sexual intimacy.
That can be a big mistake. Sex
under the influence leads to
unsafe sex practices, decreases
the ability to communicate
honestly and effectively, and is a
set-up for regretted sex.
Communication
Clearly communicate your
sexual wishes, and let your
partner know your feelings,
desires, and fears.
Always insist on safe sex.
Listen carefully to your partner.
Make sure that consent is
stated. Fuzzy communication is
a set-up for regretted sex, and
worse, for sexual assault.
Because it's rarely modeled,
honest intimate conversation
may feel uncomfortable at first.
But the more you communicate,
the more natural it will become,
and the stronger you and your
relationship will be. □
