1958
On October 23, 192H, Hie Daily report
ed on the modesty of Stanford sorority girls.
"1 las (lit' broadening inllnence of a col
lege education completely eradicated
women's blush?
"Evidence u> the contrary was discov
ered on the campus early yesterday morn
ing. When the girls of a sorority house
looked across their lawn yesterday morn
ing they were astonished at the scene that
met their eyes. Something was amiss here!
A line ol long woolen ihing-a-nia-jigs,
which were prominently displayed there,
caught and held the attention ol amused
passersby.
"When the jibes oi the assembling
crowd became unbearable, one ol the sis
ters stepped out on the porch, gritted her
teeth and proceeded to remove the offend
ing articles from the public ga/e amid
cheers and applause.
"Let it be known to the c redit of female
modesty, tli.it although she maintained
perfect poise, her complexion lor the mo
ment became scai let."
Bottom line: Oh, how times have changed. How
would she have reacted to the streakers at Full
Moon on the Quad if she were a student today?
