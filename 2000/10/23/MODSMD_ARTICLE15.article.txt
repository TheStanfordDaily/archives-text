SARA J EVO, Bosnia- Herze
govina (AP) — Yugoslavia's new
president averted a diplomatic
debacle today by meeting Bosnia's
political leaders, defusing anger
over his decision to use his first
tl ip to the country to attend a cer
emony that some said had ethnic
overtones.
Vojislav Kostunica's visit was
(he first a Yugoslav leader has
paid to Bosnia, a former
Yugoslav republic, since the 3
1/2-year war here ended half a
decade ago. He spent part of the
day in the small southern Bosni
an town of Trebinje before living
oil to Sarajevo, the Bosnian capi
tal, for the meeting.
Kostunica's stop in Trebinje
seemed simple enough: I le was in
town to attend a reburial service
fora prominent Serb poet. But in
Bosnia — which lought to sepa
rate itself from Serb-dominated
Yugoslavia in 1991 and was sub
sequently ripped apart by ethnic

warfare between Serbs, Croats
and Muslims — the visit caused
an uproar.
The Croat and Muslim mem
bers of Bosnia's three-person
multiethnic presidency were
insulted that the new Yugoslav
leader, who is a Serb, chose an
event with nationalistic Serb over
tones for his first visit. Though
Kostunica attended the reburial
privately, the Bosnian govern
ment believed it signaled that he
had not fully accepted the coun
try's independence.
Compounding the problem,
Kostunica's visit fell just three
weeks before national elections in
Bosnia.
International officials hastily
convened a meeting between
Kostunica and the members of
the presidency. Bosnia's top
international official, Wolfgang
Petritsch, persuaded Kostunica to
take part in the symbolic 30-
ininute meeting.
