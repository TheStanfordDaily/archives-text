3 JERUSALEM (AP) — Ehud Barak tailed lor a
peace "time-out" and Yasser Aralai told him to "go to
hell." The Israeli and Palestinian leaders seemed fur
ther than ever yesterday from the peace their ITS.
and Egyptian sponsors have tried so hard to salvage.
The violence in the West Bank and the <>a/a Strip
showed no signs of abating, and the ( ease-lire called
during last week's peace summit was little more than
a memory.
In the fiercest lighting in the Jerusalem environs
since clashes broke out on Sept. 2<S, Israeli helicopter
gunships rocketed the Palestinian-held village ol Beit
Jalla. Some Palestinian homes were leveled. Electric
ity and phone lines were down, and Palestinians s.tid
the power plant had been hit.
The three hours of lighting started when Pales
tinian gunmen in Beit | alia and in Bethlehem
opened lire on residential apartment buildings in
Gilo, a suburb of Jerusalem, and Israeli police
returned tank, machine-gun and helicopter rocket
lire.
The army said it warned residents ol targeted
areas in Beit jalla to evacuate before it launched its
counterattack. Gilo residents gathered in the streets
to watch and cheered each hit.
Next to a church in the largely Christian village,
the gate to the Dabdoub family home was damaged.
Inside, 10-year-old Dalia shuddered beneath the
lolcls ola blanket, huddling next to her mother.
Abdullah Dabdoub said he was considering taking
his wife and daughters and leaving the region.
" They could cut off our electricity, they could cut
oil our water, they could starve us to death." he said.
Bullets entered some homes in ('.ilo. Families with
small children fled to homes of neighbors with apart
ments facing away from the Palestinian-controlled
areas.

Poting 11is two-year old daughter beneath his
arms, Yair Peretz tracked a bullet's trajectory lor a
I V crew. "It came in here, whizzed over her head
here on the couch, where she was sitting," he said,
relet t ing to the girl, "and came out here."
Elsewhere, lour Palestinians died in clashes,
including two teen-age Palestinians in the Ga/.a
Strip, and two Palestinian men near the West Bank
town of H"bron. Stone-throwing clashes were
reported in several chronic trouble spots in Gaza
and the West Bank. 1 hat lelt a total of 121 dead —
the v.isi majority Palestinian — in more than three
weeks of violence.
"We need to have a time-out ... to reassess the
peace process in light of the events of the last lew
weeks," Barak told his weekly Cabinet meeting
yesterday.
"One would have to be blind to security and
political needs to continue as if nothing has
changed," he said.
A statement issued by Barak's office did not say
how long the "time-out" would last. Israeli negotia
tors would refuse to meet with their Palestinian
counterparts until the time-out was lifted.
Araiat, speaking after returning yesterday from a
two-day Arab summit in Cairo, said the Palestinian
state would come — with or without the peace pro
cess. or Barak's approval.
"Mv response (to the time-out) is, our people is
continuing their road to Jerusalem, the capital of the
Palestinian state,"he said. Whether Barak accepts
that or not, Araiat said — in English — "Let him go
to hell."
I he intensification of the rhetoric came despite
efforts by Kgypt and the United States — the princi
pal sponsors <>l Israel and the Palestinians, respec
tively — to salvage the peace process.
