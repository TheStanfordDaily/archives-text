## The 						Stanford Daily Measure A a boon for Silicon Valley transit 
### 
Published Since 1891

Measure A is a much needed reme
dy for paralyzing traffic conges
tion in Silicon Valley. The ballot
proposal will raise $6 billion for
projects such as BART extension, the electrifi
cation and expansion of Caltrain, the addition
of at least two new light-rail lines and
increased rail and bus service. For only acon
tinuation of the current half-cent in the sales
tax upon its expiration in 2006, the initiative
would fund essential mass transit improve
ments in Santa Clara County. Measure A sig
nifies a tremendous and timely opportunity
for the Stanford community and the entire
region.
Silicon Valley has developed in a rapid and
chaotic manner over the past 20 years. It
remains the world s hottest labor market but a
place that people have difficulty living in; few

affordable housing options exist and traffic is a
nightmare.
The public transportation movement start
ed to build steam in the 1990s when San Jose
made light-rail service a reality and BART
expansion became a major political issue.
Now Santa Clara County is in position to
make its greatest commitment to mass transit
yet.
Because Measure A did not garner the com
plete support of the county's Board of Super
visors, the Valley Transportation Authority's
Board of Directors placed it on the upcoming
ballot with an 11-1 vote.
The opposition criticizes Measure A
because they believe it might not provide
immediate traffic relief, it may run into finan
cial problems and it funds neither road
improvements nor it affordable housing. They

think we should wait fora better alternative on
the 2001 or 2002 ballot.
Like any massive public works project,
Measure A has its associated costs. It's
expense, however, is inevitable for an area
trying to build a public transportation sys
tem virtually from scratch. Moreover,
affordable housing will follow the transit. In
fact, a mass transportation system must pre
cipitate denser, cheaper housing. It will also
save residents on car costs and make it easi
er for earless Stanford students to get
around the area.
Furthermore, delay is not a viable option.
The local economy is churning and the state
has pledged $725 million to local transporta
tion projects if Measure A passes. Who knows
if the money will be there in two years? Who
knows what the economy will be like in two

years?
Granted, Measure A cannot eliminate
every single traffic problem in Silicon Val
ley. Nevertheless, the improvements and
expansion of Caltrain, the new rail corri
dors and the increased bus service that
Measure A perscribes are necessary steps
that will susbtantially ameliorate trailic
congestion.
Measure A has the backing of the Palo Alto
mayor, the Palo Alto City Council, Congres
sional opponents Jim Cuneen and Mike
Honda, Senatorial opponents Tom Campbell
and Diane Feinstein, 13 of the 14 other may
ors in Santa Clara county, the A\RP, the Santa
Clara Superintendent of Schools, the Califor
nia State Automobile Association and Gover
nor Gray Davis. It has our backing, and it
should have yours, too.
