# TURNING AND TURNING
## Naderites, I'll cover you 
### 
Atypical scene from a big-budget
Hollywood movie: The hero,
panting, looks over his shoulder
and impulsively orders his side
kick to cover him. His sidekick then lays
down a barrage ol gunfire, allowing the
hero to accomplish complex acrobatic
feats of athleticism and marksmanship in
order to save the clay, get the girl and
otherwise accomplish "The Greater
Good." Ihe sidekick, for his part, gets
shot in the leg.
For some reason, this year's presiden-

tial election is looking
a lot like a big-budget
Hollywood movie —
and not just because
it's boring and formu
laic. The real action on
the political stage is
not between Bush and
Gore, because we can
safely sav that the only

people voting for Bush
are Trotskyists trying to hasten the onset
of "the revolution," postmodernists will
ing to do anything to defy common
sense and people who can't stand Alec
Baldwin. Instead, the action is behind
the barricade, where the hero and the
sidekick face off before the climactic
gunfight.
Imagine (.ore and Nader crouching
behind a barricade, bullets zipping over
their heads. In the minds of many,
including myself, Ralph Nader is clearly
the hero because his purpose is to achieve
a ( -reater (iood for this country, if not the
world, by promoting lofty ideals. Vote for
Nader, sa\ his supporters, if only to send
a message to Washington that this coun
try will not stand for "politics as usual."
Well, I'm sold.
I his puts Al Gore into the sidekick
role, because Gore is not so much pro
moting the Greater Good as he is pre
venting the Greater Evil. His initia
tives and promises, while admirable,
do not serve to elevate the nation's
ideals, but, rather, target immediate
conditions and voting trends. In fact,
the primary value of a President Gore
is that he would occupy the seat in
which a President Bush might other
wise be silting. It's the political equiv
alent of hiding behind a barricade,
sticking your hand around a corner
and shooting Wildly while, ideally, the
hero saves the clay.
So, naturally, I'm voting for (iore.
I jet me explain. Barring a miraculous
deviation from polling data and historical
patterns. Ralph Nader will not become the

next president of the United States of
America. This pains me to no end, but
does force me to rewind the tape and take
another look at the scene, taking into
account the exceedingly high probability
that the hero doesn't make it in his clash
ing charge. Someone still has to stop the
bad guys. Naturally, my eyes turn to the
sidekick.
I feel like I'm rationalizing a compro
mise here, so let me state it in stark, and
perhaps extreme, terms: For reasons too
numerous to address in this space,
George W. Bush cannot be allowed to be
tlie next president of the United States.
In Hollywood terms, this outcome would
constitute a bullet to the brain. That, and
we can't afford to lose Alec Baldwin, who
has threatened to move to France if Bush
prevails, where lie will become a preten
tious recluse like John Malkovich and
gain enough mystical aura that some
indie filmmaker will make "Being Alec
Baldwin."
Ahem.
I admire not only Nader's espousal of
the Greater Good, but also the enthusiasm
and idealism of his supporters. While I
count myself as one of them, I fear that I
shall support him in name alone. Gall it
the Hippocratic vestiges of a pre-med past,
but I am placing "do no harm" above "do
the greater good" in this case. So I'll vote
for Gore — if only to ensure that Bush
doesn't come to power. Because somebody
has to stop the bad guys, even if it means
fighting dirty.
You who are voting for Nader, I
encourage you to do so. There aren't
enough of you as it is, and I do not want
your numbers to dwindle. The message
that your vote sends to our country is
important. Indeed, I am almost inclined to
c all you the heroes of this election. Unfor
tunately, we do not seem to be living in a
heroic age, and the values of the Holly
wen >d bloc kbuster simply do not account
for what happens when the hero's ideals
leave the villains triumphant.
We may find ourselves having to
rethink heroism, and the paths that we
take to achieving the Greater Good.
Rather than going for broke and losing,
however, it may be time to take the bullet
in the leg ... and one in the arm ... and
another in the chest... and win.
So, go ahead and vote for Nader. I'll
cover you.
