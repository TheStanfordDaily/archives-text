### MEREDITH ROWE EDITORIAL STAFF 
The I niviTsilN has promised i<> raise one
billion dollars lor undergraduate education
over the next live years, I niversiu President
John 1 lennessv announced Fridax during his
inauguration at Frost Amphitheater.
Flic' Campaign lor I ndergraduate Educa
tion, which has alreacK collected $429 million
from alumni, has several objectives, including
increasing financial aid and permanent!) en
dowing programs such as Sophomore (lollege
and Stanlbrd Introductory Studies.
According to John Ford, vice president lor
development, the campaign lias been in plan
ning stages for the past two vears.
"When we in Building 10, our alumni co
chairs and the trustees asked what we reallv
needed to fulfill our dreams lor undergradu
ate education, we concluded that the $ 1 billion
target was the right one," 1 lennessv said. "It is
the largest campaign ever solelv lodised on

undergraduate education."
I lie funds will Ik- tunneled into tour areas,
all generally focused on increasing endow
ment.: $300 million in endowment specifically
for undergraduate programs, including fresh
men and s< >pliomorc small-group experiences
and junior and senior research opportunities;
$300 million tor endowed financial aid, includ
ing need-based and athletic scholarships: $.300
million to support other departmental and ac
tivity programs; and $100 million in discre
tionary money tor the Stanford Fund.
Alumni and parents of undergraduates
have been .incl will continue to be the primary
source of the giving, not corporations, accord
ing to John Bravman, vice provost tor under
graduate education.
Bravman emphasized that one ot the goals
ot the campaign is to strengthen the bonds be
tween these alumni and the Universitv.
"We have volunteers throughout thecoun
ir\ raising contributions who are all seasoned
veterans and friends of the University," he

said. "We want to further increase the number
of people well educated in the needs of the
University.
"We want [donations from) people tor
whom this is the natural inevitable next step,"
he added. "We'd rather have ten people give
one dollar than one person give ten dollars."
For the campaign's alumni co-chairs, do
nating indeed appears to have been the natur
al next step. Ihe live couples — Anne and
Robert Bass, M.B.A. '71; Helen and IVter
Bing, '55; Akiko Yama/aki, '90, and |errv
Yang, '00, M.S. '00; Susan Rasinski McCaw,
'84, and Craig McCaw, '72; and Helen and
Charles Schwab, '59, M.B.A. '61—have to
gether given more than $200 million.

from 1987 to '92. Additionally, the
(Campaign for Stanford, which gar
nered $304 million from 1972 to
'77. iind the Plan of Action fora
Changing Era Program, which in
tended to raise $100 million be
tween 1961 to '64. were both ex
tremely enterprising for their time.
However, each of these cam
paigns sought to raise money for
University-wide programs, not
soleh undergraduate education,
Bravman stressed.
"We knew coming out of devel
opments in the past five to six years
in undergraduate education ... .we
knew we'd need something to pay
for that permanently," he said.
Endowing undergraduate
programs
I he $300 million specifically
earmarked for undergraduate
programming will go toward per
manently endowing recently insti
tuted initiatives such as Sophomore
College, Stanford Introductory
Studies and Introduction to the
I lunianities.
All of these are expendable pro
grams, meaning that if the L'niver
sit\ faced a period of extreme li
mine ial duress, their budgets could
lie eliminated. But the endowed
funds will be a big step in making
sure tlmt all future classes will be
able to benefit from these small
group experiences, Bravman said.
"We won't have to worry about
canceling programs because of fi
nancial reasons," he said. "For in
stance. Sophomore College would
be cut [nowj if the economy turned
downward. We won't have to
worry about that.
"1-1 him is a very expensive pro
gram." he added. "I low we run the
program now currently depends
on a large amount of cash" to keep
class sizes it.id discussion seminars
small and personal.
Also greatly impacted will be op
portunities for juniors and seniors
to engage in independent re

search. The University has offered
a program for the last four to five
years that funds departments for
undergraduate research pro
grams, but many students have not
been able to reap the benefits due
to budget constraints.
Now, however, all undergradu
ate students will be able to partici
pate in such research should they
feel so inclined.
"We want to bring the research
strength of the University to a
much larger number of under
graduates than would have ever
been possible," Bravman said.
"We'll now be in the position to
send out the call [for funding] to all
departments."

The $300 million will go
to programs across the
University that are gener
ally highly regarded by
students and faculty.'
— John Bravman

Increasing financial aid
endowment
As a "need-blind" university,
meaning that undergraduate stu
dents are admitted despite their li
nancial need, Stanford must con
stantly monitor the funds it lias
available for need-based and ath
letic scholarships.
(Currently, according to Univer
sity statistics, 42 percent of entering
undergraduates qualify for some
sort of University aid.
Thus, Hennessy s.iid, it is only
fitting that a substantial portion of
the campaign money is direc ted to
ward permanently endowing fi
nancial aid.
"This past year we made several
enhancements to our financial aid
program that were designed to
keep a Stanford education afford
able," he said. "$250 million of the
campaign will go this end."

The remaining $50 million will
go toward endowing athletic
scholarships.
Essentially, the campaign will
make it possible for financial aid to
be obtained almost entirely
through the endowment — rather
than from general discretionary
funds. For instance, 00 percent of
funds raised annually by the Sum
ford Fund currently go to need
based aid.
"As we increase the endowment
for financial aid, money flowing
there now can be used elsewhere,"
Bravman said. "For instance, ii is
very hard to find donors to pay for
dormitories . . . most people don't
want to do that."
Now, lie added, the lieed-up
general 112 unds will be usable toward
those directives.
Supporting a full range of
opportunities
The third $300-million portion
of the campaign will go toward
strengthening a wide variety of
programming throughout the
University, from projects in the
School of Engineering to Stanford
in Washington, Overseas Studies
and the I faas C lenter.
Alumni donating money toward
this area have a number of oppor
tunities to participate in the
campaign.
I hey can help fund the Earth
S\steins Program, which is seeking
to raise $7 million in endowment
funds to cover its yearly budget.
1 hey can also donate to pro
grams such as Writing and (Critical
flunking, foreign language studies
and interdisciplinary programs in
cluding Human Biology, Interna
tional Relations and Feminist Stud
ies. which Hennessy noted are
often under-funded.
" l lie $1100 million will go to pro
grams across the University that
are generally highly regarded by
students and facultv," Bravman
said. "We don't always want to have
a question mark over the budgets
of these programs."
Laura Sel/nick, director of Un
dergraduate Research Opportuni

ties, said she was excited about the
opportunities the campaign will
afford.
"We're very hopeful that expan
sion will be made possible by 112 und
ing from the new campaign," she
said. "It will add new dimensions to
undergraduate research we
haven't seen yet... .The money is
being put to work already."
Supporting the Stanford Fund
Fhe remaining $100 million will
go to the Stanford Fund, which
currently provides scholarships for
more than 1,200 undergraduate
students per year and provides
112 unding for the enhancement of in
novative programming.
One of the major goals of the
fund during this campaign will be
to increase the number of alumni
making contributions, ac cording to
11 ei messy.
Participation in giving is already
up 112 rom the early 1090s—in 1002
undergraduate alumni donated at
a rale of 23 percent; as of Sept. 1,
the rate is up to 40 percent, which
Ford calls a "remarkable increase."
Additionally 78 percent of seniors
this past year contributed to the
University, a large jump from just
eight percent in 1002.
( her the five years of the cam
paign. every alumni c lass will have
an opportuniiv to contribute to the
fund, as well as to organize giving
campaigns of their own.
Bravman said the planned sup
port for the fund is impressive.
"$lOO million in five years is an
aggressive g<>al." he saic I." 1 hat's al
most double the current giving
rate."
Similar campaigns nationwide
Stanford is not tlieonh universi
ty currently seeking to raise a sub
stantial amount of money. In lad.
1(> other colleges and universities
are in the middle of $1-billion c api
tal campaigns or have alt each raised
that amount with a lower initial goal.
Among these are (lolumbia Uni
versity, which has alreadv raised
$2.7 billion as of Sept. 30; their goal
was $2.2 billion b\ December. MI 1

has collected $ 1.03 billion asof ( X t.
I.S, and hopes to increase that
amount to $1.5 billion by 2004.
Closer to home, UC-Berkeley is
conducting a campaign of its own:
$1.25 billion lias already been gar
nered. surpassing a goal ol $ 1. 1 bil
lion by December.
Additionally, more than 140
other colleges are also in fund-rais
ing campaigns, though with lower
ultimate financial goals.
Bravman maintains, however,
that this is the largest campaign
every devoted solely to endowing
and improving undergraduate
education.
Reaping the benefits
Though they may not see any
dramatic changes, undergraduate
students are already benefiting
from the campaign through the
commitment to continue strong

The biggest differences
are already in place.
Frosh entering right now

and think they've always

initiatives that are now several
years old, University officials said.
" The biggest differences are al
ready in place," Bravman said,
"l'rosh entering right now see
freshmen programs and think
they've always been in place . . . but
they haven't. They won't see a
change unless they're looking at a
snapshot of five to seven years ago."
Moreover, Bravman said, the
larger endowment will make it eas
ier to direct other University fund
ing elsewhere: to faculty salaries
and housing, among other areas.
"The big pressures on the Uni
versity now are on housing of every
type," he said. "Responding to
these will take more cash than we
have right now.
"Staff salaries are also a big

issue," he added. "And average fac
ulty salaries do pretty well, but
where we find real competition is in
hiring, especially star faculty."
Ultimately, Bravman said, the
campaign is a "bold statement of
what the University should be
doing.
"Our alumni are really delight
ed and excited," he said. "Alumni
really think of undergraduate pro
grams like these when they're
thinking about donating."
Currently, Stanford's endow
ment is approximate!)' $8.2 billion,
according to Ford/1 his endowment
is small compared to schools like the
University of Texas and Harvard
University, which has an endow
ment of more than $20 billion. It is
not essential that Stanford's hold
ings mirror those of other universi
ties, Bravman stressed, but it is es
sential to have enough resources to
continue providing the amount of
opportunities available now.
"When our friends and staff go
out with this kind of message, the
most frequent statement is, 'Stan
ford is so rich, why are you doing
this?"' he said. "But when you ex
plain the nature of an endowed in
stitution, then people realize we are
not rich. \\'e have vast land wealth
. . .[but] we are in desperate need of
these resources. I've found that
when vou explain this to people,
they understand."
Students are already reacting
positively to the campaign.
"I'm really excited that students
in future years will be able to enjoy
Sophomore College and introduc
tory seminars like I did," junior
Flita (iheung said.
It is this kind of reaction the
chairs of the campaign are looking
lor from students like (Iheung and
her predecessors —excited and
supportive.
"My greatest hope is that this
campaign will engage .is many of
our alumni as possible," I lennessy
said, "and that they will have the
opportunity to see the tremendous
enthusiasm of the faculty and stu
dents for what we have and will ac -
complish."

paigns sought to raise money for
University-wide programs, not
soleh undergraduate education,
Bravman stressed.
"We knew coming out of devel
opments in the past five to six years
in undergraduate education ... .we
knew we'd need something to pay
for that permanently," he said.
Endowing undergraduate
programs
I he $300 million specifically
earmarked for undergraduate
programming will go toward per
manently endowing recently insti
tuted initiatives such as Sophomore
College, Stanford Introductory
Studies and Introduction to the
I lunianities.
All of these are expendable pro
grams, meaning that if the L'niver
sit\ faced a period of extreme li
mine ial duress, their budgets could
lie eliminated. But the endowed
funds will be a big step in making
sure tlmt all future classes will be
able to benefit from these small
group experiences, Bravman said.
"We won't have to worry about
canceling programs because of fi
nancial reasons," he said. "For in
stance. Sophomore College would
be cut [nowj if the economy turned
downward. We won't have to
worry about that.
"1-1 him is a very expensive pro
gram." he added. "I low we run the
program now currently depends
on a large amount of cash" to keep
class sizes it.id discussion seminars
small and personal.
Also greatly impacted will be op
portunities for juniors and seniors
to engage in independent re

search. The University has offered
a program for the last four to five
years that funds departments for
undergraduate research pro
grams, but many students have not
been able to reap the benefits due
to budget constraints.
Now, however, all undergradu
ate students will be able to partici
pate in such research should they
feel so inclined.
"We want to bring the research
strength of the University to a
much larger number of under
graduates than would have ever
been possible," Bravman said.
"We'll now be in the position to
send out the call [for funding] to all
departments."

The $300 million will go
to programs across the
University that are gener
ally highly regarded by
students and faculty.'

Increasing financial aid
endowment
As a "need-blind" university,
meaning that undergraduate stu
dents are admitted despite their li
nancial need, Stanford must con
stantly monitor the funds it lias
available for need-based and ath
letic scholarships.
(Currently, according to Univer
sity statistics, 42 percent of entering
undergraduates qualify for some
sort of University aid.
Thus, Hennessy s.iid, it is only
fitting that a substantial portion of
the campaign money is direc ted to
ward permanently endowing fi
nancial aid.
"This past year we made several
enhancements to our financial aid
program that were designed to
keep a Stanford education afford
able," he said. "$250 million of the
campaign will go this end."

The remaining $50 million will
go toward endowing athletic
scholarships.
Essentially, the campaign will
make it possible for financial aid to
be obtained almost entirely
through the endowment — rather
than from general discretionary
funds. For instance, 00 percent of
funds raised annually by the Sum
ford Fund currently go to need
based aid.
"As we increase the endowment
for financial aid, money flowing
there now can be used elsewhere,"
Bravman said. "For instance, ii is
very hard to find donors to pay for
dormitories . . . most people don't
want to do that."
Now, lie added, the lieed-up
general 112 unds will be usable toward
those directives.
Supporting a full range of
opportunities
The third $300-million portion
of the campaign will go toward
strengthening a wide variety of
programming throughout the
University, from projects in the
School of Engineering to Stanford
in Washington, Overseas Studies
and the I faas C lenter.
Alumni donating money toward
this area have a number of oppor
tunities to participate in the
campaign.
I hey can help fund the Earth
S\steins Program, which is seeking
to raise $7 million in endowment
funds to cover its yearly budget.
1 hey can also donate to pro
grams such as Writing and (Critical
flunking, foreign language studies
and interdisciplinary programs in
cluding Human Biology, Interna
tional Relations and Feminist Stud
ies. which Hennessy noted are
often under-funded.
" l lie $1100 million will go to pro
grams across the University that
are generally highly regarded by
students and facultv," Bravman
said. "We don't always want to have
a question mark over the budgets
of these programs."
Laura Sel/nick, director of Un
dergraduate Research Opportuni

ties, said she was excited about the
opportunities the campaign will
afford.
"We're very hopeful that expan
sion will be made possible by 112 und
ing from the new campaign," she
said. "It will add new dimensions to
undergraduate research we
haven't seen yet... .The money is
being put to work already."
Supporting the Stanford Fund
Fhe remaining $100 million will
go to the Stanford Fund, which
currently provides scholarships for
more than 1,200 undergraduate
students per year and provides
112 unding for the enhancement of in
novative programming.
One of the major goals of the
fund during this campaign will be
to increase the number of alumni
making contributions, ac cording to
11 ei messy.
Participation in giving is already
up 112 rom the early 1090s—in 1002
undergraduate alumni donated at
a rale of 23 percent; as of Sept. 1,
the rate is up to 40 percent, which
Ford calls a "remarkable increase."
Additionally 78 percent of seniors
this past year contributed to the
University, a large jump from just
eight percent in 1002.
( her the five years of the cam
paign. every alumni c lass will have
an opportuniiv to contribute to the
fund, as well as to organize giving
campaigns of their own.
Bravman said the planned sup
port for the fund is impressive.
"$lOO million in five years is an
aggressive g<>al." he saic I." 1 hat's al
most double the current giving
rate."
Similar campaigns nationwide
Stanford is not tlieonh universi
ty currently seeking to raise a sub
stantial amount of money. In lad.
1(> other colleges and universities
are in the middle of $1-billion c api
tal campaigns or have alt each raised
that amount with a lower initial goal.
Among these are (lolumbia Uni
versity, which has alreadv raised
$2.7 billion as of Sept. 30; their goal
was $2.2 billion b\ December. MI 1

has collected $ 1.03 billion asof ( X t.
I.S, and hopes to increase that
amount to $1.5 billion by 2004.
Closer to home, UC-Berkeley is
conducting a campaign of its own:
$1.25 billion lias already been gar
nered. surpassing a goal ol $ 1. 1 bil
lion by December.
Additionally, more than 140
other colleges are also in fund-rais
ing campaigns, though with lower
ultimate financial goals.
Bravman maintains, however,
that this is the largest campaign
every devoted solely to endowing
and improving undergraduate
education.
Reaping the benefits
Though they may not see any
dramatic changes, undergraduate
students are already benefiting
from the campaign through the
commitment to continue strong

The biggest differences

initiatives that are now several
years old, University officials said.
" The biggest differences are al
ready in place," Bravman said,
"l'rosh entering right now see
freshmen programs and think
they've always been in place . . . but
they haven't. They won't see a
change unless they're looking at a
snapshot of five to seven years ago."
Moreover, Bravman said, the
larger endowment will make it eas
ier to direct other University fund
ing elsewhere: to faculty salaries
and housing, among other areas.
"The big pressures on the Uni
versity now are on housing of every
type," he said. "Responding to
these will take more cash than we
have right now.
"Staff salaries are also a big

issue," he added. "And average fac
ulty salaries do pretty well, but
where we find real competition is in
hiring, especially star faculty."
Ultimately, Bravman said, the
campaign is a "bold statement of
what the University should be
doing.
"Our alumni are really delight
ed and excited," he said. "Alumni
really think of undergraduate pro
grams like these when they're
thinking about donating."
Currently, Stanford's endow
ment is approximate!)' $8.2 billion,
according to Ford/1 his endowment
is small compared to schools like the
University of Texas and Harvard
University, which has an endow
ment of more than $20 billion. It is
not essential that Stanford's hold
ings mirror those of other universi
ties, Bravman stressed, but it is es
sential to have enough resources to
continue providing the amount of
opportunities available now.
"When our friends and staff go
out with this kind of message, the
most frequent statement is, 'Stan
ford is so rich, why are you doing
this?"' he said. "But when you ex
plain the nature of an endowed in
stitution, then people realize we are
not rich. \\'e have vast land wealth
. . .[but] we are in desperate need of
these resources. I've found that
when vou explain this to people,
they understand."
Students are already reacting
positively to the campaign.
"I'm really excited that students
in future years will be able to enjoy
Sophomore College and introduc
tory seminars like I did," junior
Flita (iheung said.
It is this kind of reaction the
chairs of the campaign are looking
lor from students like (Iheung and
her predecessors —excited and
supportive.
"My greatest hope is that this
campaign will engage .is many of
our alumni as possible," I lennessy
said, "and that they will have the
opportunity to see the tremendous
enthusiasm of the faculty and stu
dents for what we have and will ac -
complish."

According to John Ford, vice president lor
development, the campaign lias been in plan

"When we in Building 10, our alumni co

Alumni and parents of undergraduates
have been .incl will continue to be the primary
source of the giving, not corporations, accord
ing to John Bravman, vice provost tor under

Bravman emphasized that one ot the goals
ot the campaign is to strengthen the bonds be

"We have volunteers throughout thecoun

said. "We want to further increase the number

he added. "We'd rather have ten people give

very hard to find donors to pay for
dormitories . . . most people don't
want to do that."
Now, lie added, the lieed-up
general 112 unds will be usable toward
those directives.
Supporting a full range of
opportunities
The third $300-million portion
of the campaign will go toward
strengthening a wide variety of
programming throughout the
University, from projects in the
School of Engineering to Stanford
in Washington, Overseas Studies
and the I faas C lenter.
Alumni donating money toward
this area have a number of oppor
tunities to participate in the
campaign.
I hey can help fund the Earth
S\steins Program, which is seeking
to raise $7 million in endowment
funds to cover its yearly budget.
1 hey can also donate to pro
grams such as Writing and (Critical
flunking, foreign language studies
and interdisciplinary programs in
cluding Human Biology, Interna
tional Relations and Feminist Stud
ies. which Hennessy noted are
often under-funded.
" l lie $1100 million will go to pro
grams across the University that
are generally highly regarded by
students and facultv," Bravman
said. "We don't always want to have
a question mark over the budgets
of these programs."
Laura Sel/nick, director of Un
dergraduate Research Opportuni

ties, said she was excited about the
opportunities the campaign will
afford.
"We're very hopeful that expan
sion will be made possible by 112 und
ing from the new campaign," she
said. "It will add new dimensions to
undergraduate research we
haven't seen yet... .The money is
being put to work already."
Supporting the Stanford Fund
Fhe remaining $100 million will
go to the Stanford Fund, which
currently provides scholarships for
more than 1,200 undergraduate
students per year and provides
112 unding for the enhancement of in
novative programming.
One of the major goals of the
fund during this campaign will be
to increase the number of alumni
making contributions, ac cording to
11 ei messy.
Participation in giving is already
up 112 rom the early 1090s—in 1002
undergraduate alumni donated at
a rale of 23 percent; as of Sept. 1,
the rate is up to 40 percent, which
Ford calls a "remarkable increase."
Additionally 78 percent of seniors
this past year contributed to the
University, a large jump from just
eight percent in 1002.
( her the five years of the cam
paign. every alumni c lass will have
an opportuniiv to contribute to the
fund, as well as to organize giving
campaigns of their own.
Bravman said the planned sup
port for the fund is impressive.
"$lOO million in five years is an
aggressive g<>al." he saic I." 1 hat's al
most double the current giving
rate."

Additionally, more than 140
other colleges are also in fund-rais

ultimate financial goals.
Bravman maintains, however,
that this is the largest campaign

and improving undergraduate
education.
Reaping the benefits
Though they may not see any
dramatic changes, undergraduate
students are already benefiting
from the campaign through the
commitment to continue strong

The biggest differences

initiatives that are now several
years old, University officials said.
" The biggest differences are al
ready in place," Bravman said,
"l'rosh entering right now see
freshmen programs and think
they've always been in place . . . but
they haven't. They won't see a
change unless they're looking at a
snapshot of five to seven years ago."
Moreover, Bravman said, the
larger endowment will make it eas
ier to direct other University fund
ing elsewhere: to faculty salaries
and housing, among other areas.
"The big pressures on the Uni
versity now are on housing of every
type," he said. "Responding to
these will take more cash than we
have right now.
"Staff salaries are also a big

issue," he added. "And average fac
ulty salaries do pretty well, but
where we find real competition is in
hiring, especially star faculty."
Ultimately, Bravman said, the
campaign is a "bold statement of
what the University should be
doing.
"Our alumni are really delight
ed and excited," he said. "Alumni
really think of undergraduate pro
grams like these when they're
thinking about donating."
Currently, Stanford's endow
ment is approximate!)' $8.2 billion,
according to Ford/1 his endowment
is small compared to schools like the
University of Texas and Harvard
University, which has an endow
ment of more than $20 billion. It is
not essential that Stanford's hold
ings mirror those of other universi
ties, Bravman stressed, but it is es
sential to have enough resources to
continue providing the amount of
opportunities available now.
"When our friends and staff go
out with this kind of message, the
most frequent statement is, 'Stan
ford is so rich, why are you doing
this?"' he said. "But when you ex
plain the nature of an endowed in
stitution, then people realize we are
not rich. \\'e have vast land wealth
. . .[but] we are in desperate need of
these resources. I've found that
when vou explain this to people,
they understand."
Students are already reacting
positively to the campaign.
"I'm really excited that students
in future years will be able to enjoy
Sophomore College and introduc
tory seminars like I did," junior
Flita (iheung said.
It is this kind of reaction the
chairs of the campaign are looking
lor from students like (Iheung and
her predecessors —excited and
supportive.
"My greatest hope is that this
campaign will engage .is many of
our alumni as possible," I lennessy
said, "and that they will have the
opportunity to see the tremendous
enthusiasm of the faculty and stu
dents for what we have and will ac -
complish."
The I niviTsilN has promised i<> raise one

over the next live years, I niversiu President
John 1 lennessv announced Fridax during his

Flic' Campaign lor I ndergraduate Educa
tion, which has alreacK collected $429 million
from alumni, has several objectives, including
increasing financial aid and permanent!) en
dowing programs such as Sophomore (lollege
and Stanlbrd Introductory Studies.
According to John Ford, vice president lor
development, the campaign lias been in plan
ning stages for the past two vears.
"When we in Building 10, our alumni co
chairs and the trustees asked what we reallv
needed to fulfill our dreams lor undergradu
ate education, we concluded that the $ 1 billion
target was the right one," 1 lennessv said. "It is
the largest campaign ever solelv lodised on

undergraduate education."
I lie funds will Ik- tunneled into tour areas,
all generally focused on increasing endow
ment.: $300 million in endowment specifically
for undergraduate programs, including fresh
men and s< >pliomorc small-group experiences
and junior and senior research opportunities;
$300 million tor endowed financial aid, includ
ing need-based and athletic scholarships: $.300
million to support other departmental and ac
tivity programs; and $100 million in discre
tionary money tor the Stanford Fund.
Alumni and parents of undergraduates
have been .incl will continue to be the primary
source of the giving, not corporations, accord
ing to John Bravman, vice provost tor under
graduate education.
Bravman emphasized that one ot the goals
ot the campaign is to strengthen the bonds be
tween these alumni and the Universitv.
"We have volunteers throughout thecoun
ir\ raising contributions who are all seasoned
veterans and friends of the University," he

said. "We want to further increase the number
of people well educated in the needs of the
University.
"We want [donations from) people tor
whom this is the natural inevitable next step,"
he added. "We'd rather have ten people give
one dollar than one person give ten dollars."
For the campaign's alumni co-chairs, do
nating indeed appears to have been the natur
al next step. Ihe live couples — Anne and

from 1987 to '92. Additionally, the
(Campaign for Stanford, which gar
nered $304 million from 1972 to
'77. iind the Plan of Action fora
Changing Era Program, which in
tended to raise $100 million be
tween 1961 to '64. were both ex
tremely enterprising for their time.
However, each of these cam
paigns sought to raise money for
University-wide programs, not
soleh undergraduate education,
Bravman stressed.
"We knew coming out of devel
opments in the past five to six years
in undergraduate education ... .we
knew we'd need something to pay
for that permanently," he said.
Endowing undergraduate
programs
I he $300 million specifically
earmarked for undergraduate
programming will go toward per
manently endowing recently insti
tuted initiatives such as Sophomore
College, Stanford Introductory
Studies and Introduction to the
I lunianities.
All of these are expendable pro
grams, meaning that if the L'niver
sit\ faced a period of extreme li
mine ial duress, their budgets could
lie eliminated. But the endowed
funds will be a big step in making
sure tlmt all future classes will be
able to benefit from these small
group experiences, Bravman said.
"We won't have to worry about
canceling programs because of fi
nancial reasons," he said. "For in
stance. Sophomore College would
be cut [nowj if the economy turned
downward. We won't have to
worry about that.
"1-1 him is a very expensive pro
gram." he added. "I low we run the
program now currently depends
on a large amount of cash" to keep
class sizes it.id discussion seminars
small and personal.
Also greatly impacted will be op
portunities for juniors and seniors
to engage in independent re

search. The University has offered
a program for the last four to five
years that funds departments for
undergraduate research pro
grams, but many students have not
been able to reap the benefits due
to budget constraints.
Now, however, all undergradu
ate students will be able to partici
pate in such research should they
feel so inclined.
"We want to bring the research
strength of the University to a
much larger number of under
graduates than would have ever
been possible," Bravman said.
"We'll now be in the position to
send out the call [for funding] to all
departments."

The $300 million will go
to programs across the
University that are gener
ally highly regarded by
students and faculty.'

Increasing financial aid
endowment
As a "need-blind" university,
meaning that undergraduate stu
dents are admitted despite their li
nancial need, Stanford must con
stantly monitor the funds it lias
available for need-based and ath
letic scholarships.
(Currently, according to Univer
sity statistics, 42 percent of entering
undergraduates qualify for some
sort of University aid.
Thus, Hennessy s.iid, it is only
fitting that a substantial portion of
the campaign money is direc ted to
ward permanently endowing fi
nancial aid.
"This past year we made several
enhancements to our financial aid
program that were designed to
keep a Stanford education afford
able," he said. "$250 million of the
campaign will go this end."

The remaining $50 million will
go toward endowing athletic
scholarships.
Essentially, the campaign will
make it possible for financial aid to
be obtained almost entirely
through the endowment — rather
than from general discretionary
funds. For instance, 00 percent of
funds raised annually by the Sum
ford Fund currently go to need
based aid.
"As we increase the endowment
for financial aid, money flowing
there now can be used elsewhere,"
Bravman said. "For instance, ii is
very hard to find donors to pay for
dormitories . . . most people don't
want to do that."
Now, lie added, the lieed-up
general 112 unds will be usable toward
those directives.
