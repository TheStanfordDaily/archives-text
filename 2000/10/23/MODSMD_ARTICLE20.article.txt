Ease traffic, vote in favor of Measure A
I have lived and commuted in this valley
for over If) years. During that time, I have
seen congestion go from bad to worse.
Thank gcxxlness that voters in this county
had the foresight to approve two previous
transportation measures which have added
miles of new freeway lanes and rail lines to
the area. I can't imagine what traffic would
be like without these improvements. Bui
we can't stop there. Traflic continues to
grow, and we must make more improve
ments to avoid total gridlock.
We now have the chance to approve
the best transportation measure yet with
Measure A on this November's ballot.
With Measure A, we will finally bring
BART to San Jose, add more light rail,
connect the lines to the airport and
improve our roads, too. The best part is
that it won't increase our existing tax
rate. We can't miss this chance. Don't let
traflic destroy our quality of life. Let's
approve Measure A in November!

New Yorkers psyched for Subway Series
I was upset to read Jefl(xx>per's column
"World Series Fun Gone in a New York
Minute" (Oct. 19). He completely does not
grasp the significance of a Subway Series.
As a native New Yorker, I am excited — to
say the least. I do not blame Q>oper if he
does not want to watch the World Series
since he is not from New York, nor would

I blame him if he did not want to watch any
World Series without his local team. Hut lot
New Yorkers, a Subway Series denotes a
significant event.
For years, the Mets and Yankees never
played each other in the regular season.
Most seasons you would root lor both
teams or for the one that was actually win
ning. 1 lien a few years ago, interleague
play came along — in part for New York
and other multi-teamed cities to begin seri
ous fandomonium when the two local
teams played. I his happened to occur just
as the Yankees and Mets were 011 the rise.
Since both teams were doing well, New
Yorkers became either Yankees or Mets
fans, but never both.
The past few weeks have been a New
Yorker's dream. Due to the inconsistent
play of both teams for much of the season,
this situation was unexpected. This World
Series has galvanized and divided New
York at the same time. I'm from the sub
urbs, so neither team is local enough for
me to root fora team based 011 the "Bronx
vs. Queens" concept.
Instead, many New Yorkers will be
amongst friends and enemies everywhere
they go. Hut this is a friendly rivalry. Just
today, I.a diehard Yankees fan, was talking
to one of my friends after class only to be
appalled that she was a Mets fan. This real
ization, however, just made us want to
watch the World Series together even
more.
One thing you have to rememlxT is that
New York is very passionate about sports,
especially baseball. I notice myself cursing
more at Stanford athletic events than Cali
fornians. When I talk al)out the Subway

Series to people, ihey say, "Who cares?"
Well, New Yorkers care. I along with other
New Yorkers are not gloating to non-New
Yorkers that onr city has two pennants
while their hometowns have none.
When somebody announced during
this week's Axe Committee meeting that
the Yanks had just won and that it was
going to be a Subways Series, you could tell
the cheering from the New Yorkers was
not boastful at all. We just wished we were
back on the other coast fora week and
were happy that we could put aside Clinton
vs. Lazio to think about the New York
dream, which may not occur again fora
while.
Oh, yeah, by the way, my prediction:
Yanks take it in four.
