i han I've had."
I he king and his daughter,

children and the eklerl) and to
promote Romanian culture.
I he foundation developed
several measures to protect Ro

munity health < linic, a public

health education program and
several other measures aimed at
health care for the elderly and
cultivation and protection ol Ro
manian culture. Now the founda
tion has grown throughout the
United States, England and
Switzerland and is still going
strong.
'()ur mission ... is to continue
to renew dignity, support grass
roots initiatives and to ensure that
the programs we launch become
self-sustaining," the princess
wrote in a letter to her supporters.
After his tour of the archives,
Michael also held an informal
press conference with reporters
from newspapers in Romania and
the I niled States regarding such
issues as Romanian youth and
their hopes lor the future, the
King's relationship with the
church and with the government
of Romania.
Michael was king of Romania
from 1927 to 1930. Mis father,
Carol 11, returned to rule in
19.30, but Michael took over
when his father abdicated the
throne in 1940. ()ne of his most
important moments in history in
volved overthrowing Romania's
I.isc ist dictator and removing Ro
mania from World War II in
1911. He was exiled by I he (loin
munist Party in 1947 and re
turned to visit Romania in 1992.
In 1998, he was nominated for

ihe Nobel Peace Pri/e for his role
in helping to shorten World War
11.
To the king, the social situa
tion in Romania is less than
satisfying.
"The people who do know and
should know don't do anything,"
lie told reporters.
Ihe education system also
contributes to Romanian trou
bles. "We learn here, we try to get
jobs and nothing happens," the
King said. Ihe lack of jobs has
caused main Romanians to move
west to the I nited States.
Despite t his dark description,
the King still believes there is hope
for the future. I he King's relation
ships with the church and govern
ment are healthier, and although
he believes that the Catholic
('.hurcli of the past "cut a compro
mise with the Communist Party,"
he also believes that his relation
ship with the church has improved.
When Michael returned to Ro
mania after his exile, he was
greeted by more than 1 million
enthusiastic Romanians, who be
lieved he was returning to stay.
The king does not live in Roma
nia. but said he will keep working
to improve life for the people.
"In the right environment,
anyone can blossom," the King
said. " I want to give some hope to
those back home, but I can't find
ihe right words."
