### KALILAH ROBINSON MEGAN KNIZE 
In less than a month, Americans across the
country will hit election booths to vote lot the
next president ol the United States. Campus
political organizations, including Stanlord's
newly Ibrtned Cireen Party, are working to ed
ucate the Stanford community about the beliels
and objectives ol their parlies.
I hough the C ireen Pai t\ was active on cam
pus in 1992, it has only in the last month orga
nized once again, this time under the leader
ship ol Shac.it I .ink, a doc tot al student in histo
ry. Ihe group is co-sponsoring presidential
candidate Ralph Nader's talk tonight at
Memorial Auditorium.
"Essentially, the Cireen Part\ here stal led it
sell," Link said. "There has been so much sup
port, so many volunteers, so much active par
ticipation on the part of students that 1 have
had to do very little."
According to financial manager I arek
Ciliani, the Stanford Cireen Part\ has 100 peo
ple on its mailing list and HO to 30 people who
regularly show up to meetings.
"We oiler people with progressive values a
chance to come together and educate them
selves about what the Cireen Part\ and Ralph
Nader stand for," C iliani said.

The Cireen Party wants greater campaign fi
nance relorm, the licensing of guns as well as
greater gun control and greater environmental
reforms.
Under Link's direction, the part\ has
worked din ing the last month to increase cam
pus awareness of what the Cireen Part\ is and
what ideas it represents.
Link noted that one of Nader's top priorities
is to increase public involvement in the dcmoc -
rartc system.
Peter Stair, a junior, slopped out ofStanlord
this quarter to work in Nader's press room.
"So tar, we have organizations on almost 900
c ampuses,'" Stair said. "Ihe C ireen 1 'ai t \ has al
reach replaced the Relorm Parts as America's
pre-eminent third party."
One ol the first objectives ol Stanford dub
was to get eligible Stanford students registered
to vote before the Ch i. 10 deadline.
In recent weeks, the group has shifted its
main loc us to organizing meetings and infor
mative sessions where people can learn what
the Cireen Parly believes in. " feach-ins" are
informal information sessions where people
interested in finding out about the Cireen
Party can learn where the Part\ stands on
some ol the kev issues involved in this \ear's
election.
Mam people are less familiar with the \iews

of the (ireen l'ariy because
Nadar was not allowed lo
part it ipate in the recent pres
idential debates, 1 herelore,
the Stanlbrd Clreen Part\ is
working to ensure that stu-

(It'iits have the opporiunit\ to learn about these
views.
But even after the election. Link said, "we
will continue lo engage the Stanlbrd communi
ty on those issues that we leel the major parties
would rather ignore."
