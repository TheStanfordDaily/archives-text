### ADAM LEVERMORE-RICH 
With jusi IT> clays remaining be
fore the Nov. 7 election, presiden
tial candidates Al (lore and George
W. Bush are traveling the country
in an attempt to get iheir message
out to as main undecided voters as
they can. Bui according to MTV,
the (feneration X crowd is still in
the dark about election issues.
Researc hers at M I V released a
surve\ last week indicating that .is
main as one-c|uarter of people be
tween the ages of IS and 2 4 are
unable to idem if \ the two major
part\ candidates for president.
And more than two-thirds cannot
name the vice presidential candi
dates.
Stanford students had mixed
reactions to this news.
"I ilmik people lend to leel that
thev're not being spoken to In the
presidential candidates," said
Abbv I'helps, a sophomore. "I def
iniieh get the sense that most peo
ple between the ages of IS and 24
are prohabh not going to vote."
Sophomore Ben Schneider
agrees.
"I think fora lot of people who
are in the age group of IS to 24,
ihe\ re on college campuses, living
iu their little bubble, where the\ re
not allected b\ the outside world
.md don't leel allec ted In politics."
he said. "I nloriunateh that leads
to not voting."
I he M I V survey supports
Schneider's 11 icon. Eight years
ago, nearlv two-t birds ol people in
the target age range said they
were c ertain to vote. I oday, ac
cording to the study, only one
third sax they will definitely go to
the polls ibis November.
But does ibis lack <>l excitement

among young people mean that
lhey are less active than their pre
decessors? Julia Cohen, executive
director ol Youth Vote 2000,
doesn't think so. (ohen oversees a
coalition of groups working to en
courage civic participation in
voting people. She says that IS-to
24-year-olds are more politically
active today than they've ever
been, but that as a group they are
not being addressed.
"The lac k of knowledge isn't
apathy," Cohen said. "It's the fail
ure of the education system and
the failure ol candidates to reach
out to young people."
Cohen believes that the candi
dates are trying to address young
voters, bui thai their messages are
getting garbled.
She cites as an example the can
didates' responses to the question
of voter apathy among young peo
ple in last week's presidential de
bale in Missouri. The question
came from a college professor,
who commented that many young
people feel that no issues a 1 feet
litem.
Cohen says the candidates' an
swers lell short of addressing the
problem and may have even
served to worsen it.
" I hey needed to say more than
'people need to tell the truth," she
said. Both candidates finished
ilicir answers by pushing issues
that have dominated their cam
paigns. such as campaign finance
and social security - issues that are
olicn seen as being targeted at an
older audience.
Young people care about issues
like these, ( ohen said, "but they're
not necessarily going to be recep
tive to [a candidate talking about]
the McCain-Feingold Bill."
