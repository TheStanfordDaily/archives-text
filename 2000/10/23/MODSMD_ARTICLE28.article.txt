## Football downs Trojans, 32-30 
### MATT LONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Chi is Lewis is carving out a
unique niche on l he Stanford
football team. The redshirt fresh
man quarterback is quickly estab
lishing himself as the best reliever
in college football. I \\ite this sea
son the starter has gone down
with injury, and twice Lewis has
come in for the save, delivering
game-winning touchdown strikes
in both appearances.
Lewis' 0-3 record as a starter
may be nearh forgotten after Sat
urday's game-winning touchdown
toss to junior Jamien McCullum.
Lewis found his receiver streaking

toward the back-tight corner of the
end /one as time expired, beating
Southern (California 32-30.
Just as in Stanford's 27-24 victo
ry over then-No. 5 1 exas, starting
quarterback Randy I'asani was
forced to leave the game after injur
ing his knee. Only this lime Lewis
had jnsi seconds to get the C Car
dinal in the end /.one.
Stanford (3-4, 2-2 Pacific 1(>
(.Conference) trailed I S(C (3-4, 0-4)
30-20 when Lewis came in on the
frqjans' 22-yard line. Lewis hit Mc
(Cullumon a seven-yard out pattern
to bring up a first down on the 10.

In 11 u' next three plays Lewis threw
three incomplete passes, two of
which nearly ended up in the
hands <>! the Trojan secondary.
With lour seconds left, the (Cardinal
drew two penalties — first a delay
of faille, then offsides.

surprisingly calm despite the cer
taim\ that this play would decide
the game and had the potential lo
turn the (Cardinal's three-game los
ing streak around.
"When |Rand\] went down I
thought, 'Not again, Lewis said.
"I wasn't nervous. I went out there
and looked iu [I SC! linebacker]
Zeke Moreno's eyes and just nod
ded my head — it's just fun being
out there. It's what you pla\ lor.
There's no reason lo gel nervous."
The play left McCullum wide
open, and he onl\ had to catch the
ball «ind survive the resulting mob
ol players dogpiling him to send
Stanford fans into a frenzy as the\
witnessed the miraculous home
coming victorv.
"The List pi.i\ was a deeper pass
combination, which we thought
would draw the d<mblc coverage ol
Deßonnie hits, which ii did, and
leave |amien McC'.ullum open,"
s.iid coach Tvrone Willingham.
Bclorc the last-second heroics,
the (Cardinal oflense demonstrated
.i consistence ii has lacked since the
Texas win. Lasani's knee nagged
him the entire game, but he still
completed LS-.'M passes for 1 ( .)(>
\ards after a four-game absence.
I as,mi was not timid, despite lus re
cent injurv, and rushed for several
kc\ first downs. According to the
(Cardinal coaching stall, his reinjurv
is minor, and he is expected to prac
tice all week.
"| Lasani's] performance was just
flat gutsy," Willingham said. "Lor
him lo come back todav .uul play
thewa\ he did was amazing. That's
the kind of leader he is."
l asani's return brought out the
best in senior wideout Deßonnie

Pius, who caught a career-high 13
passes lor 1 7f> yards.
"I was getting a lot of good sepa
ration when they were singling me
out," Litis said. "| Ranch ] was mak
ing good throws and a couple ol
times I just stuck with him, aild I
was able to gel open."
Along Avith Stanford's typical air
attack came the ground assault of
sophomore runningback Kerry
(Carter. Before Saturday, the (Cardi
nal had run across the goal line only
once all season. (Carter's four touch
downs lied a Stanford record, and
his 123-yard game was the first 100-
\ arc I game b\ a (Cardinal running
back ihis year.
Stanford led 14-Sat the half, be
hind (Cartel end/one dives of three
.iikl foui vards. The third quarter
started with the (Cardinal moving
the ball SO yards in over live min
utes and capping the scoring drive
with (Carter's two-yard run. The
point after tailed after a bad snap,
and Southern (California took over

trailing 20-8.
Trojans' sophomore tailback
Sultan McC'ullough scored on a 34-
yard stamper, and, on the first play
<>l Stanford's next drive, Cll iris Cash
intercepted Kasani.
I S(took over on the Stanlbrd
2f> and three plays later Petros Pa
padakis scored on .1 two-yard run.
I'he Trojans' two-point try was un
successful, and they led 21-20 en
tering the fourth quarter.
Hie Trojans' continued their
comeback rampage behind a 22-
vard folin Wall field go.il and then,
alter a Stanlbrd punt, drove to the
one yard line where sophomore
quarterback (larson Palmer walked
iu on a bootleg. I JS('. led 30-20 with
just over eight minutes remaining.
('.alter scored on a 20-yard
sweep 111 the next series, and the
Stanlbrd defense forced the Tro
jans to punt after three plays. I he
punt rolled out ol bounds at the 50,
setting up the winning drive and
Lewis's heroic redemption.
