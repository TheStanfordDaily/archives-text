a thrilling 32-30 victory over I S( land sending the

This pla\ has the makings of one that will siic k
up there in the lore of Stanford sports, i each to be

grin on one's lace.
In a way, it's a shame that pla\ had to happen
as it did; not because Stanlord won 111 smli

overshadow one of the greatest receiving d.i\s in
Cardinal history. A 13-catch. 17(>-vard, grittv,
dutch receiving day In a plaver used to being
overshadowed.
I)eßonnie Pitts didn't catch that final pass, but

he was probably as responsible for it as anyone
not named Lewis or McCullum. After Pitts
shredded the I SC sciondar) lor all those catch
es and all those \ards, I rojans head coat h Paul

not let Pitts beat his team at the end. Hackett's

1 here shouldn't be am doubt In now, howev

I'SC.), defensive squads throughout the Pac-IO
were made t< > fear the speed and shiitiness of Stan

plement in oflensive coordinator P>ill Diedrick's
passing game.
Kvervone, including the media, opposing
coaches. I A' announcers and Pac-1() fans,

seemed to get unable to get their fill of Walters
and his amazing story — coming to Stanford
after being hardly recruited out of high school to
become the greatest wide receiver in school lus
tory and an NFL draft pick.
While Walters's name was on everyone's lips.
Pitts would always be there, making the tough
catch when Walters was doubled, lighting for the
extra yard, toiling not in obscurity but in a lack of
appreciation. Even Stanford's own fans probablv
didn't realize just how important he was to the
offense last year.
Without record-setting quarterback I odd
I lusak, also gone to the NFL this vear, Pitts has
weathered the ups-and-downs of Lewis and
presumed starter Randy Fasani, who threw him
all of those 13 balls Saturday. I hrough it all —
including the improbable upset ol I ex,is, the
embarrassment last week at Oregon State and
now the USC game, Pitts has made his mark as
the rock upon which the (iardmal offense rests.
Shake your head, (Cardinal fans, and discuss
Dcßonnic Pitts's greatness. He won't be
around forever.
