## 
### WENDI WHITMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
(lusty winds ranging up to 20 nipli and two
opponents hungry fora victory were not
enough to ruin the No. 20 Stanford women's
soccer team's homecoming party this weekend.
Instead, the Cardinal created a cyclone of its
own, blasting the net to rack up six goals in two
victories against Arizona and Arizona State.
Like a cyclone, the Cardinal twisted its way
around obstacles, breaking through them to
get free. When the storm started in the Stan
ford attack, the Cardinal's offensive weapons
created dangerous opportunities for which nei
ther Ari/.ona nor Arizona State had an answer.
Returning home to New Maloney Field for
the first time since a Sept. 17 victory against
Maryland. Stanford was greeted In loyal fans,
and familiar turf. I lome on the Farm, the Car
dinal garnered two important victories that
should put it back on track as it rounds out the
second half of its season. Undefeated at home
this year, Stanford finally released the potent
storing barrage that it has been lacking in the
last few games.
"It's so nice to return home and get back on
the light track. These were two important wins
for us," said senior co-captain Shauna In i.
Against -Arizona on Friday night, the Cardi
nal began the game by dictating pla\ with its
crisp passing. The Cardinal was taking better
opportunities and looked more dangerous
than it had in recent weeks.
Stanford got on the board early when
sophomore defender Katherine Harrington

connected a pass to sophomore midfielder
Kelsey (.arlson on the left side. (larlson did the
rest with some niltx moves that kit two Arizona
defenders flat-looted. She finished with a
quick, 25-yard strike that Arizona goalkeeper
Shannon Monti could onl\ partially deflect on
its way into the net. Carlson's goal in the l!Wh
minute proved to be the game winner.
Although Stanford became a bit sloppy on
the defense during the first half, it improved
defensively in the second half and gave the
Wildcats no chance of getting back in the game.
"I thought that we did a great job to tighten
up in the back in the second half, said head
coach And\ Nelson.
lu the second half, the Cardinal looked the
more dominant team as it began to send more
players forward to create scoring opportuni
ties. Stanford's constant pressure on the Ari
zona defense finally paid oil in the B(>th minute
when freshman scoring sensation
Marcie Ward iced the victoiy for the C Cardi
nal. After receiving a through ball by sopho
more (enter midfielder Callie Withers, Ward
beat an \rizona defender and sent a shot from
just inside the goal box, which found the back
of the net at the lar post.
"We plaved well against Arizona, but we
need to keep attacking if we want to get more
victories in the coming weeks," said senior co
captain (-lit ish Li Pierre.
Sunday's game against Arizona State
brought a more physical and gifted opponent
to New Maloney Field. But, just as it had done
in six previous victories at home, Stanford
brought offensive firepower of its own iti order

i<> tallv a 1-2 victory. I he Sun I )c\ its were sim

intensity.
"I thought we did ;i great j<»l» of competing
physically today. I his made a big difference."
said Nelson.
Stanford looked comfortable in front ol its
home lans as it established control ol the game
early. I lie Cardinal was the aggressor in the
first hall as it dominated possession and treat

"We went forward well and stalled different
attacks forward." said Nelson. "At the end ol
the first hall, there was a time w hen we were re

touch passing. Kverybod\ was really working
well together."
All of the ( ardinal pla\ers. including senior
