Pars are good — but birdies are better.
Ilk' lilih-ranked (Cardinal made pars —
loi» ol 1 1 lc-m — ai I lie Stanford / Pepsi Inter
collegiate tournament. which was good.
Bui ihe team failed to make main birdie
pulls, which would have been even belter
ibi Stanford (880), which finished m third
place behind lop-tanked Arizona (873) and
No. 3 Southern C lalilornia (879).
I he Cardinal led the 18-teani field with
1111 p.iis tlnoughoui the ihree-day tourna
nieni, l)in finished twelfth in birdies made.
"We gave ourselves chances to make
birdies, bill we were never able to capitalize,
which was one of our biggest problems." said
head coach (Caroline ()'(lonnor.
1 ied lor second place with Southern (.al
ifbrnia after two rounds, the Cardinal was
hoping lo use the last-second football vic tory
Saturcla\ afternoon as a catalvst lo finish
ahead ol the Trojans yesterday.
"We thought ii might have been line
shadowing." O'Connor said, "but unlbrtu
natelv. ii didn't lurn out that way."
Yesterda\ morning brought a stead v 15
mpli wind to the Stanford (><>ll(lourse. with
occasional gusts up to .SO mph, which
wreaked havoc lor much of the lield and
caused the final-round scoring average lo
rise In more than a stroke.
Seniors Milan Homeyer and Stephanie
keever both improved their individual posi
tions on Sunda\ bv taking advantage of the
scoring inllation with rounds of 76 and 74,
respectiveh.
I lomever, who moved up from 10th
place into ninth in the linal round, was the
lop (Cardinal finisher with rounds of 73-72-
7(> ( + ."1).
Keever. \\ 11<» is the nation's top-ranked
women's collegiate goiter according to the
Coll week/Sagarin ratings, moved up Hi
places in the tournament vesterdav after a
disappointing round of SO on Saturda\.
"I'm hilling the ball well, but I couldn't
gel in\ putting going," said Keever. who fin
ished lied lor 32nd with rounds ol 75-80-74
(+ 1 Si-
O'Connor agreed that the Cardinal
plaved well, but wasn't able to make critical

putts.
"[PuttingJ is something we'll work on this
week," O'Connor said of the Cardinal,
which travels to South (Carolina in two weeks
lor the Kolex Coif World Invitational. "We
need to gel more repetition [011 the greens]."
Of course, balls do not always have to be
putted into holes, as freshman Angela Rho
demonstrated with a hole-in-one Saturday.
Klio's S-iron hit the back-left pin on the
134-yard par-3 eighth hole. Ii was the first
ace of her career. I lie hole-in-one was in
strumental 111 <i two-under-par round that
moved her into .1 lie lor seventh place head
ing into the linal round.
Rho and the rest of her teammates did
not fare as well in the wind on Sunday. Rho
shot an SO to finish in <1 tie lor 12th place,
posting rounds of 72-70-80 (+0).
Sophomore Kim Rowton placed 14th
with rounds of 72-73-78 ( + 7), and senior
Jessica Bclskis lied lor 27th In shooting 77-
75-76 (+l2).
I he third-place finish was a step up from
last year, when the Cardinal placed ninth
against many of the same teams
Furthermore, the (Cardinal accomplished
a couple of (>'( 0111101 s original goals: to be
in contention to win on Sunday and to not
allow outside distractions on the Cardinal's
home course.
"We were disciplined under lough condi
tions," (VConnor said, "and I'm happy with
the wa\ we handled ourselves."
I ulsa's Stac\ Prammanasudh recorded
her second consecutive individual win by de
lending lu i title this weekend. Prammana
sudh, who lied with keever last week ai the
Kdean llilanfeldt Invitational in Washing
ton, shot rounds ol 72-08-70 (-6) to capture
the victorv.
As lor the (.arclinal, 11 garnered its second
top-three finish in two events tins vear.
"We have to keep looking at the big pic
lure." said Homeyer, who led the lield this
weekend with 45 pars. "We're looking lo
work toward nine months from now 11he
\( :AA (;hanipionships|, and nothing short
of that."
Which means that third place this week
was good — but lirst or second 111 the future
will be beller.
