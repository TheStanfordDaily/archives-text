### EZRA CALLAHAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At times this season, the Stanford
women's volleyball team has proven its
loneliness, rising to match the play of its
most challenging opponents. At others, it
has struggled, losing because of sloppy
play. I his weekend, the Cardinal did both.
At No. 8 UCLA (14-5,9-2 Pacific 10 Con
ference) Stanford (11-8, 5-6) showed the
latter, losing soundh to the Bruins !'>-() on
Thursday.
Against No. 1 I SC. (1 (>-1, 10-1) on Fri
day, Stanford was at its strongest, vasth im
proving in even statistical category. The
Cardinal took CSC to five games, with the
Trojans narrowly pulling out a H-2 victor)
in.i match which lasted nearly two and a
half hours.
"We, for some reason, did not pla\ very
well at all on Thursday," said interim head
coach Denise Cork-it. "UCLA is playing
some <>l its best volleyball of the season,
but we just weren't playing well at all out
there. So it was nice to see them come back
Friday and play one of the best mate lies of
tlie season."
Ilie losses essentially end Stanford's
hopes of defending its Fat-10 title, as the
Cardinal falls to five games back of confer
ence leaders I S( and Arizona with seven
conference games remaining on the sched
ule, but the Cardinal is read\* to continue
fighting.
"If we can go 7-2 in tlie second half (of
the season), we'll still be in good shape,"
Corlett said. "We just need to learn to
come out at the level we did against CSC
even night. 1 hat match gives us optimism
that we can compete with am team in the
country."
