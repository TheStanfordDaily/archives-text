"We contacted [Vertical Horizon and
Nine Days] because we knew tlic\ were

explained.
"This will he the last night of their fall
North American tour, and the combina

atrics will make this <1 great show," he said.
Vertical Horizon first achieved fame
with their radio hit "Everything You
Want," off the album of the same name
that has since gone platinum.

Nine Days Ikis also enjoyed significant
radio pl.i\ with tlieii song "Absolutely
(Story of a (lirl)."
Senior F.ric Silverberg said he was en
thusiastic about such <i big-name show
coming to Stanford.
"I totalh would go to the concert," he
said. "They're both bands that make
music that's fun to listen to, and I like con
certs in smaller venues."
I lie Memorial Auditorium show will
be the only Bay Area appearance for the
two bands, and the concert network ex
pects ii to sell out.
Students, staff and faculty with
Stanford 11) will be able to purchase tick

chase tickets in blocks. The dorms with
