Think Class Size
Experience has taught us that students in smaller classes
gain a distinct advantage over students in larger classes.
With a maximum of 8 students per class, our GRE, GMAT
and LSAT programs offer the most personal attention and
optimal use of your time. Small class sizes enable our in
structors to accommodate your learning style, which loads
to better results. These results will help you gain entrance
into the school of your choice.
