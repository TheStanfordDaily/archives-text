1980
On October 24, 1980, 1 he Daily pub
lished an article about the rise in populari
ty of a new sport: Frisbee.
"Stanford's long-held reputation as a sort
of intellectual country club — fostered be
cause a student can learn golf, tennis or
equestrian skill for academic credit — re
ceives an innovative boost from the latest
and most uniquely California!! class offered
this fall by the Athletic Department.. .
"A frisbee pro for the last ten years, [fris
bee class instructor and ultimate frisbee
team coach Tom] Mcßann performs nu
merous frisbee stunts — he can throw the
discover 100 yards, balance it on his
elbow, pass a spinning frisbee between his
legs over his shoulder, and the list goes on
and 0n... .
" The [ultimate frisbee] team's biggest
drawback <n this point seems to be their in
ability to decide on a name. Those present
ly under consideration are the Penetrators,
the Snowmen and the Quads."
Bottom line: Twenty years later, the Ultimate
Frisbee club is still going strong. Not too sure
about "the Snowmen," though.
