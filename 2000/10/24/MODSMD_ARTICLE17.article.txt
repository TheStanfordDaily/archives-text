Published Since IS'JI

You can do a lot with a billion dollars.
Stanford could have aimed its new
capital campaign ai anything from lab
space to landscaping. B\ lot using its
new wealth and fundraising cllorts on under
graduate education and aid, Stanford is send
ing powerful, positive messages.
The first is that graduate research isn't the
University's onl\ mission: undergraduate
teaching and research opportunities are equal
ly important. Setondlv, science isn't the I nivei
sity's onlv lotus; humanities programming is
alst) worthwhile, linallv, the I ni\'ersity is
acknowledging that a Stanford education is a
luxury that most families can't allortl alone.
Stanford's functions arc manifold, but its
most fundamental task remains educating
undergraduates. Ibis campaign goes .1 long
way toward affirming that.
Now, with the announcements made and

positive reactions registered, President Hen
ncss\ now fulfill bis promises. The spirits of
students, stall and faculty, which peaked at the
inauguration, will surelv fall il the University
tails to follow through on its admirable stated
goals. Making grand pronouncements on <» day
of < elebration is expected, but il is far more dif
ficult to turn those pronouncements into tangi
ble, lasting realities.
l.ndcaring himsell to more than a few audi
ence members. President I fennessy paid specil
i< and extensive attention to two traditionally
neglected components ol undergraduate edu
cation at Stanford, namclv, uppert lassmen and
the humanities.
With the introduction of programs like the
Stanford Introducton Seminars, I'reslunan-
Sophoinorc (College and Sophomore College,
underclassmen have been an evident target ol
I niversih tout tin and resources in recent

years.
However, with the expansion of these pro
grams. juniors and seniors have lelt a drop in
attention from the University. Many uppert lass
men have expressed desire lor more programs
and opportunities geared directly .it them. I len
nessy addressed this need directly in introduc
ing the capital campaign, stressing his vision ol
increased research opportunities for juniors
and seniors, as well as expansion antl develop
ment of majors.
1 he question remains whether increased
research opportunities will oiler humanities stu
dents the same potential for educational growth
that they have traditionally offered students in
more scientific disciplines.
I lenncssv's comments on the need for an
adaptive humanities curriculum, along with
the importance of the humanities in general,
show that humanities students' concerns

weigh heavily 011 the new president's mind. It
is in his power to determine how much effect
the process ol re-evaluating and re-empha
si/ing the role ol the humanities at Stanford
will have.
Stanford's humanities students have voiced
increasingly frantic concerns over the Universi
-1 v's perceived "techie" atmosphere, and ii is a
change in that perspective that will ultimately
judge llennessy's attempt to restructure Stan
lord's undergraduate curriculum.
A significant shift in atmosphere, then, should
he the goal ol both President Hennessy and the
capital campaign. The planned influx ol
resources, while definite and necessary, can only
help il it accompanies a sustained commitment to
making all Stanford students, regardless of year
or major, feel not onlv like they are getting their
money s worth, but, more importantly, that they
are each a valued member of this University.
