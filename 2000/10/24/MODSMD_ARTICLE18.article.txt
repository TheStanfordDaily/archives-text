# I HAVE ISSUES
## Type-casting Stanford 
### 
Alter two short weeks as a colum
nist, the siren-call of trilling ban
ter has alreach overwhelmed
me. Mesmerized. I listen as the
Muse leads me to none othet thati th.it
fail-sale* Stanford-cute column. Inspira
tion never felt so cheap.
When I entered Stanford. 1 had no
idea that a cornucopia <>l new and e\t it
ing social situations would soon be
mine, all mine. It may seem frivolous to
many, but I think new or soi iallv oblivi
ous students should be aware ol wh<> the\

are likelv lo encounter
ai Stanlord. Consider
the following a cast of
characters you would
read in a Playbill
before the lights go
down. Beyond ibis list
lies an entire drama of
your own creation.
Pseudo-earthy revolu
tionary. This type
almost never bikes

around campus. In lad, sometimes Ilie\ II
enhance their pedestrian status In walk
ing barefoot. lhe\ extol bodih uncleanli
ness and choose to live in co-ops such as
Synergy, (lolumbae or C .lti I heta (.hi.
TTiey often organize ot at least part,ike in
short-lived protests ot candlelight vigils at
the Bird ('.age. Most "revolutionaries" arc
frustrated — and righth so — In the lack
of passion they perceive in the Stanford
communiiv. This frustration is e\a< ei hal
ed by a vegan diet.
Pseudo-artsy rover. Perhaps spotting
an assortment of bodv-piercings 01 a
classic bad dye-job, these students (.in
be seen smoking a < igarette while loal
ing about the Drama Department
ironically situated right between the
Graduate Business S< liool and the K< o
nomics Department — or lounging at
the CoHo. l itis tvpe currenth finds
itself in a dilemma because the said
CoHo has become a corporate bastion
of mass consumerism in both look and
brand of coflee served. I lowcvcr, with
out another plate to haunt, the new
Col lo will have to do.
*Note: I here is no such "t\pe" as a
truly artsy person at Stanford, "pscu
tlo" is as real as it gets.
Engineers: I hcsc people are on a last
educational track that includes a co-term
within four years. I hc\ are frightcningh
brilliant and spend most of their time
working diligentl\ (e.g. thc\ will have fin
ished 1-Huin papers more than a da\ in
advance). Kngineering students are
among the nicest, most genuine people

you will ever meet at Stanford. I nlottu
natclv. von will larch encounter them
because the\ spend 110 percent of their
tune eilhet in ( lass or in their rooms.
Itlilete: A variation ol the conventional
"jot k." the Stanford athlete is more coni
milted to both sports and plnsical fitness
than the tvpical high school jock. I hex
eat e\tremcl\ well, wake up earl\ to train
and major in I linn bio so as to have the
afternoons oil lor practice. I lie male tvpe
usualh wears flip-flops, khaki shorts and
a Hawaiian or otherwise llowcrcd shirt.
Likewise, the women dress inlormally.
tending to opt lor track pants.
Sorority nerd: I hese women both stud)
and part\ hard. I he\ usualh go to the
librar\ even weekda\ and stud\ several
hours a d.i\. I he\ attend all their classes
all the time and are sure to monopolize
ollice bonis b\ asking innane questions.
In lad, the\ usualh proceed to tell the
answeis to the rest ol the people in alten
dencc. Most sororitN nerds are Leon and
I iuin bio inajoi s. ()n weekends, alter sev
eral hours of siudving, the sorority nerd
will go out to \\ hat ever part \ is being held
on campus. Ibis tvpe dales more than
am othet at Stanford. I he\ also dress up
the most, even on wcekdavs. ( 0111111011
outfits include those tight stretchv black
p.ints and rather tight shirt blouse tops.
Ihe soroi it\ nerd need not be in a soror
n\. though main are. I uteres! inglv, there
is no male equivalent lo the sororit\ nerd.
Most li.ii guvs either I.ill into the athlete
or the following category.
(ieneru /tri/>f)\ sfxirlx stiuhut: I bis is a
bit ola miscellaneous, trash-can type.
In la< t mam would argue that all Stan
lord students belong to this category.
I hese people do not dress in any par
ticPilaris distinct manner, often looking
as il the) were just coming from or
going to the gvtn. I hev perform a
great deal of extracurricular activities
and.in general, just seem to bike
around a lot and (log up the death
trap near the ('Jock I ower.
\n\ stereoivpcs, including the above,
are shallow, inaccuratc and ultitnalelv ol
little use in trul\ getting to know anyone
at Stanford or anywhere else.
However, sometimes il helps to
think categorically, as il simplifies our
li\es and brings order to the chaos thai
is realitv. In am case, please just don't
be offended.
