Nader vote admirable, but detrimental
Ralph Nader is a man l<> he admired
and in <111 ideal world would make a good
president, lint this is not an ideal world
.md the chances are that no one's ideal
candidate will ever he elected. I lie popu
lation <>l this country is so large and so
diverse tli.it onlv someone who appeals to
a hroad spectrum of opinion has .i chance
of being elected.
There are still places in this country
where it's not sale to be black or ga\ or
Asian. Many Americans believe abortion
is murder. Others don't believe in evolu
tion. Too many people tare only about
lower taxes. A poll bv the Shorenstein
Foundation at Harvard found that a
majority of Americans don't even know
or care about the issues.
Under these circumstances, those who
do (ate would do well to support the can
didate who will do the least harm and is
likely to do some good. I lie onl\ realistic
choice we have this year is between \l
(iore and (icorge W. Bush, and it (iore is
the lesser of two evils, so be it. I hose who
support Nader's principles would be set
ting back their cause il they voted lor
Nader and allowed Bush to be elec ted.
(-outran to what many Nader supporters
claim, there is a big diflerence between
(iore and Bush, and it's a diflerence that
affects the most vulnerable Americans.
For instance, 10 million people are work
ing for the minimum wage of $5.15 pet
hour and millions more can't afford both

rent and health care even though they
work lull time. (lore favors increasing the
minimum wage and the earned income
tax credit, which the Democrats have
tried to do for three vears against Repub
lican opposition. Bush would help the
ver\ rich bv repealing the inheritance tax
and cutting taxes bv $ 1 billion, which
would require gutting social programs.
(iore opposes both ol these measures and
instead would spend more mone\ hiring
teachers, repairing schools, and expand
ing health insurance to cover mam more
children.
lex.is under (inventor Bush is one ol
the most polluted states in the- countrv,
provides the least health insurance cover
age lot its children and has the highest
rate of executions. Bush vetoed a bill to
provide defendants with qualified lawyers
and vetoed a patients' rights bill that he
now claims to have supported. Bush's
election could mean extending Texas'
tarnished record to the entire nation.
Finallv, the most important issue in
this election may be the federal courts.
I'lie next President will determine the
ideological composition of the Supreme
Court and lower courts for decades to
come. 1 hese courts will make crucial
decisions on environmental regulation,
abortion lights, the tights of prisoners,
minorities, gays and lesbians and the
rights of the poor to legal representation.
II Bush is elected,we can be sure that
Tom De Fay, Trent Foil and |erry Fal
well will come out from wherever they've

been hiding during the campaign and
have a say in choosing the new justices.
Bush himself says that Antonin Scalia and
Clarence Thomas are the kind of justices
he would appoint. 1 he Supreme Court is
now divided 5 to 1 on several important
issues and the next President may have as
many as three vacancies to till.
Nader's supporters have two choices,
either a Hawed Al (lore who has <i chance
of winning, or a ver\ good Ralph Nader
who has no chance. Some will vote their
consciences and choose Nader in the
hope that some day there will he a nation
al change of heart. But millions of Amer
icans can't wait that long. 1 heir schools
need fixing, their children need health
care, they need better paying jobs and
stronger unions — and they need these
things now, not later, Gays and lesbians
need to enjoy the rights of every other < it -
i/.en when it comes to jobs or adoption or
serving in the military. We all need ( lean
er air and water and protection of wilder
ness areas and forests. The crucial differ
ence between Bush and (lore is that (iore
believes government must protect the
resources of this country and provide for
needs that ordinary individuals can't
meet themselves. Bush believes in using
the government to serve the rich.

Land Use Plan ruins Foothills
I leel it is my duly as «i resident ol I'alo

F< >< >t hills.
I he foothills are a jewel that Stan

Stanlord now appears to be committed
to despoiling the foothills without
regard lor the wishes of eithet I'alo Alto
residents or their own student body.
W hen I decided to move to Palo
Alto just over two vears ago from
New |ersev, I asked a colleague at
Bell Labs who had graduated from
Stanford to recommend running
routes. She told me that I would
have to seek out the Dish and run its
manv scenic paths.
Although she had graduated over 15
vears earlier, I lbund the dish and the
paths to be just as she had described
them, much to my delight. Running the
Dish has been a highlight of tn\ new life
here on the West (.oast.
When Stanlord dosed the Foothills on

the pretext of doing environmental restora
tion, onl\ to pave t lie main route and place
numerous ugh metal and concrete signposts
all along the path, residents and students
alike sullered the tragic loss of a living part
of our common heritage.
I have found Palo Alto and the P>a\
Area in general to be home to the most
capable, intrepid people I have encoun
tered anywhere. Surely such a group
will not allow the abusive course that
Stanford has chosen to be pursued

Land Use Plan's environmentalist
opposition off base
For the past year, I have watt lied a
vocal minority in the community hide
behind the title of "environmentalists"
and make unreasonable demands ol
Stanford I nivcrsity.
Real environmentalists t are about
humans and our relationship to
nature. 1 lies seek sound public poli
cies that appropriately balance

human needs and environmental
preservation and restoration. More
over, thev back their beliefs with
ac tion and money.
I he leaders of the "environmental
ists" who oppose Stanford's Land I se
Plan are onh interested in delving
Stanford and taking awa\ its property
rights. I hex seek to trounce on Stan
lord's private propertv, and they claim
that the public actually has a right to
do so. I hc\ denounce Stanford's
ellbrts to restore and preserve its pop
ular Foothills area known as the Dish.
1 bev demand permanent protection
ol Stanford's Foothills, despite the lac I
that Stanford has agreed to preserve
the Foothills lot 25 years.
II these lolks were indeed environ
mentalists, the\ would support Stan
lords ellorts to restore the I >ish area. II
they were true environmentalists, they
would raise money and purchase avail
able open space in the area instead of
demanding that someone else give it to
them lot Iree. If they were environmen
talists. they would rccogni/e Stanford's
Plan is smart growth, environment
friendly development at its finest. They
would also endorse Stanford's 25-vear

promise to preserve the Foothills and
realize their voices have been heard and
w ill be heard in 25 vears.
Instead, these so-called environ
mentalists stick to their extremist
position. Fhe truth is that the lead
ers ol this opposition ellort are not
"environmentalists," they are
obstructionists.

Land Use Plan ruins Foothills
I leel it is my duly as «i resident ol I'alo

Stanlord now appears to be committed
to despoiling the foothills without
regard lor the wishes of eithet I'alo Alto
residents or their own student body.
W hen I decided to move to Palo
Alto just over two vears ago from
New |ersev, I asked a colleague at
Bell Labs who had graduated from
Stanford to recommend running
routes. She told me that I would
have to seek out the Dish and run its
manv scenic paths.
Although she had graduated over 15
vears earlier, I lbund the dish and the
paths to be just as she had described
them, much to my delight. Running the
Dish has been a highlight of tn\ new life
here on the West (.oast.
When Stanlord dosed the Foothills on

the pretext of doing environmental restora
tion, onl\ to pave t lie main route and place
numerous ugh metal and concrete signposts
all along the path, residents and students
alike sullered the tragic loss of a living part
of our common heritage.
I have found Palo Alto and the P>a\
Area in general to be home to the most
capable, intrepid people I have encoun
tered anywhere. Surely such a group
will not allow the abusive course that
Stanford has chosen to be pursued

Land Use Plan's environmentalist
opposition off base
For the past year, I have watt lied a
vocal minority in the community hide
behind the title of "environmentalists"
and make unreasonable demands ol
Stanford I nivcrsity.
Real environmentalists t are about
humans and our relationship to
nature. 1 lies seek sound public poli
cies that appropriately balance

human needs and environmental
preservation and restoration. More
over, thev back their beliefs with
ac tion and money.
I he leaders of the "environmental
ists" who oppose Stanford's Land I se
Plan are onh interested in delving
Stanford and taking awa\ its property
rights. I hex seek to trounce on Stan
lord's private propertv, and they claim
that the public actually has a right to
do so. I hc\ denounce Stanford's
ellbrts to restore and preserve its pop
ular Foothills area known as the Dish.
1 bev demand permanent protection
ol Stanford's Foothills, despite the lac I
that Stanford has agreed to preserve
the Foothills lot 25 years.
II these lolks were indeed environ
mentalists, the\ would support Stan
lords ellorts to restore the I >ish area. II
they were true environmentalists, they
would raise money and purchase avail
able open space in the area instead of
demanding that someone else give it to
them lot Iree. If they were environmen
talists. they would rccogni/e Stanford's
Plan is smart growth, environment
friendly development at its finest. They
would also endorse Stanford's 25-vear

promise to preserve the Foothills and
realize their voices have been heard and
w ill be heard in 25 vears.
Instead, these so-called environ
mentalists stick to their extremist
position. Fhe truth is that the lead
ers ol this opposition ellort are not
"environmentalists," they are
obstructionists.

Nader vote admirable, but detrimental
Ralph Nader is a man l<> he admired
and in <111 ideal world would make a good
president, lint this is not an ideal world
.md the chances are that no one's ideal
candidate will ever he elected. I lie popu
lation <>l this country is so large and so
diverse tli.it onlv someone who appeals to
a hroad spectrum of opinion has .i chance
of being elected.
There are still places in this country
where it's not sale to be black or ga\ or
Asian. Many Americans believe abortion
is murder. Others don't believe in evolu
tion. Too many people tare only about
lower taxes. A poll bv the Shorenstein
Foundation at Harvard found that a
majority of Americans don't even know
or care about the issues.
Under these circumstances, those who
do (ate would do well to support the can
didate who will do the least harm and is
likely to do some good. I lie onl\ realistic
choice we have this year is between \l
(iore and (icorge W. Bush, and it (iore is
the lesser of two evils, so be it. I hose who
support Nader's principles would be set
ting back their cause il they voted lor
Nader and allowed Bush to be elec ted.
(-outran to what many Nader supporters
claim, there is a big diflerence between
(iore and Bush, and it's a diflerence that
affects the most vulnerable Americans.
For instance, 10 million people are work
ing for the minimum wage of $5.15 pet
hour and millions more can't afford both

rent and health care even though they
work lull time. (lore favors increasing the
minimum wage and the earned income
tax credit, which the Democrats have
tried to do for three vears against Repub
lican opposition. Bush would help the
ver\ rich bv repealing the inheritance tax
and cutting taxes bv $ 1 billion, which
would require gutting social programs.
(iore opposes both ol these measures and
instead would spend more mone\ hiring
teachers, repairing schools, and expand
ing health insurance to cover mam more
children.
lex.is under (inventor Bush is one ol
the most polluted states in the- countrv,
provides the least health insurance cover
age lot its children and has the highest
rate of executions. Bush vetoed a bill to
provide defendants with qualified lawyers
and vetoed a patients' rights bill that he
now claims to have supported. Bush's
election could mean extending Texas'
tarnished record to the entire nation.
Finallv, the most important issue in
this election may be the federal courts.
I'lie next President will determine the
ideological composition of the Supreme
Court and lower courts for decades to
come. 1 hese courts will make crucial
decisions on environmental regulation,
abortion lights, the tights of prisoners,
minorities, gays and lesbians and the
rights of the poor to legal representation.
II Bush is elected,we can be sure that
Tom De Fay, Trent Foil and |erry Fal
well will come out from wherever they've

been hiding during the campaign and
have a say in choosing the new justices.
Bush himself says that Antonin Scalia and
Clarence Thomas are the kind of justices
he would appoint. 1 he Supreme Court is
now divided 5 to 1 on several important
issues and the next President may have as
many as three vacancies to till.
Nader's supporters have two choices,
either a Hawed Al (lore who has <i chance
of winning, or a ver\ good Ralph Nader
who has no chance. Some will vote their
consciences and choose Nader in the
hope that some day there will he a nation
al change of heart. But millions of Amer
icans can't wait that long. 1 heir schools
need fixing, their children need health
care, they need better paying jobs and
stronger unions — and they need these
things now, not later, Gays and lesbians
need to enjoy the rights of every other < it -
i/.en when it comes to jobs or adoption or
serving in the military. We all need ( lean
er air and water and protection of wilder
ness areas and forests. The crucial differ
ence between Bush and (lore is that (iore
believes government must protect the
resources of this country and provide for
needs that ordinary individuals can't
meet themselves. Bush believes in using
the government to serve the rich.
