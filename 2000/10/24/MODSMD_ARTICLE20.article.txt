Nader vote admirable, but detrimental
Ralph Nader is a man l<> he admired
and in <111 ideal world would make a good
president, lint this is not an ideal world
.md the chances are that no one's ideal
candidate will ever he elected. I lie popu
lation <>l this country is so large and so
diverse tli.it onlv someone who appeals to
a hroad spectrum of opinion has .i chance
of being elected.
There are still places in this country
where it's not sale to be black or ga\ or
Asian. Many Americans believe abortion
is murder. Others don't believe in evolu
tion. Too many people tare only about
lower taxes. A poll bv the Shorenstein
Foundation at Harvard found that a
majority of Americans don't even know
or care about the issues.
Under these circumstances, those who
do (ate would do well to support the can
didate who will do the least harm and is
likely to do some good. I lie onl\ realistic
choice we have this year is between \l
(iore and (icorge W. Bush, and it (iore is
the lesser of two evils, so be it. I hose who
support Nader's principles would be set
ting back their cause il they voted lor
Nader and allowed Bush to be elec ted.
(-outran to what many Nader supporters
claim, there is a big diflerence between
(iore and Bush, and it's a diflerence that
affects the most vulnerable Americans.
For instance, 10 million people are work
ing for the minimum wage of $5.15 pet
hour and millions more can't afford both

rent and health care even though they
work lull time. (lore favors increasing the
minimum wage and the earned income
tax credit, which the Democrats have
tried to do for three vears against Repub
lican opposition. Bush would help the
ver\ rich bv repealing the inheritance tax
and cutting taxes bv $ 1 billion, which
would require gutting social programs.
(iore opposes both ol these measures and
instead would spend more mone\ hiring
teachers, repairing schools, and expand
ing health insurance to cover mam more
children.
lex.is under (inventor Bush is one ol
the most polluted states in the- countrv,
provides the least health insurance cover
age lot its children and has the highest
rate of executions. Bush vetoed a bill to
provide defendants with qualified lawyers
and vetoed a patients' rights bill that he
now claims to have supported. Bush's
election could mean extending Texas'
tarnished record to the entire nation.
Finallv, the most important issue in
this election may be the federal courts.
I'lie next President will determine the
ideological composition of the Supreme
Court and lower courts for decades to
come. 1 hese courts will make crucial
decisions on environmental regulation,
abortion lights, the tights of prisoners,
minorities, gays and lesbians and the
rights of the poor to legal representation.
II Bush is elected,we can be sure that
Tom De Fay, Trent Foil and |erry Fal
well will come out from wherever they've

been hiding during the campaign and
have a say in choosing the new justices.
Bush himself says that Antonin Scalia and
Clarence Thomas are the kind of justices
he would appoint. 1 he Supreme Court is
now divided 5 to 1 on several important
issues and the next President may have as
many as three vacancies to till.
Nader's supporters have two choices,
either a Hawed Al (lore who has <i chance
of winning, or a ver\ good Ralph Nader
who has no chance. Some will vote their
consciences and choose Nader in the
hope that some day there will he a nation
al change of heart. But millions of Amer
icans can't wait that long. 1 heir schools
need fixing, their children need health
care, they need better paying jobs and
stronger unions â€” and they need these
things now, not later, Gays and lesbians
need to enjoy the rights of every other < it -
i/.en when it comes to jobs or adoption or
serving in the military. We all need ( lean
er air and water and protection of wilder
ness areas and forests. The crucial differ
ence between Bush and (lore is that (iore
believes government must protect the
resources of this country and provide for
needs that ordinary individuals can't
meet themselves. Bush believes in using
the government to serve the rich.
