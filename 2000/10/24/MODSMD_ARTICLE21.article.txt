# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Puke, pot, sex and smoothies: a first-month freshman checklist 
### MARK SILVER GUEST COLUMNIST 
Welcome, freshmen, to this
wonderful place we call Stan-
Ibrd. It's lale ()ctober, and In
now you've had llie opportu
ne to meet vonr dornimatcs, run with the
Band, pass out naked on the llooi and par
ticipate in all those other glorious riles of
passage ol \our lirsi lew weeks at college.
Belore \o\emhei tolls around. I thought
1 should provide von with a short list ol
seven things von must do — things von
max not have thought ol vet — in vonr
first month at Stanford. I call tliis list:
Seven Things You Must Do In Your
First Month At Stanford
I) Fail a midterm. Now I know vou're
gung-ho lor a siraighl-A record here, hut
don't let tli.it pipe dream spoil vom lim
lor too long. II voifre one of those special

lew in vonr class entering as a pre-med, go
ahead and bomb that ( hem .HI midterm.
Co on, do it.
I lien von can cjuicklv drop thai ill-fated
dream, major in Knglish and pari\ the rest
of vonr time here. You'll save two vears of
awful classes and avoid a world of pain.
Pre-meds love pain, Tliev love it so much
thai ihe\ want to become doctors so thai
tliev can be around pain all the time. Who
wants to be like that?
2) Vomit.You haven't reallv lived until
you've spent the night in vour hall bath
room. c urled up by the toilet. I lien you
can start earl) on those semi-intelligible
"I'll never drink again vows, which will
quickl) be forgotten as soon as vou are
awakened either b\ the sun or In someone
urinating on vour head. I suggest taking
vour shirt oil: You'll keep it dean and vou
can use it as a pillow.
Sleep with your TA. Do vou reallv

think writing good papers and turning in
perlect problem sets will get you good
grades? l liink again. Remember, you
have much more control over vour CPA
earlv on in your Stanford career, so don't
take am chances. Start those meaningful
stares as soon as possible. Who knows, vou
might actually enjov it.
1) Get a Jamba Juice. But don't drink
it —that stnil is nasty. Dump it out and
lill your B<X o/. cup with a Iro/en margari
ta or, better yet, vodka. I hen you'll be
able to look like all those other Stanford
kids, but you'll have a special secret.
Kveryone else will be energi/cd and revi
talized, but you'll be drunk, and we all
know which is better (see #2).
.->) Make your RA get you high.'l'hev
may seem like they're on crack, but those
Resident Assistants are reallv just ,t bunch
of shameless pot heads. Since I heir mission
is to educate vou and open vou to new

experiences, gentlv persuade tliein to let
you partake of some of their stash. While
there may be a red light lor R-\-fresh man
hook-ups, in this area, the light flashes
green, green, green.
(>) Call your professor an idiot. You
don't have to do it direct!}. but in to insult
one of vour (lIV or 1-1 lum or World ( ul
ture or Culture Club (whatever they're
calling ii these da\s) professors personally,
preferablv in front of a large audience.
You can start debating him or heron some
high-brow philosophical point (e.g. Did all
those c ra/\ Creeks reallv love little bovs or
were tliev just putting lis on?), steadily
escalate the argument, then end with
something like: "How you got to leach a
course in anything is tot all) ama/ing!" lry
using a snooty, pseudo-British accent
throughout; it will add to ihe ellect.
7) Stay up all night having a deep con
versation. Make sure vou stall .it around

2:30 a.ill. or so, so ili.n u will fx- .1 legiti
mate "late night' discussion. Share .ill 11 it
sends oi'vour soul, like how spiritual \oi
re.ilK are deep down or how vour trip l<
Papua New Guinea toiallv, like, made vol
jfiow as a person. The next day, a< 1 awk
ward and pretend not to know your con
yersation partner. Otherwise you migh
actual!) start a friendship.
That's it lor now. I'm sure you'll lint
some other Inn things to do, but il \ou'vt
got these seven nailed down, you're I<>l
an exciting first month.
You can also go Ibuntain-liopping
hot-tuhhing or engage in some othei
water acti\ity.
But do it naked, or else you're just w ast
ing everyone's time.
Mark Silver is a senior majoring 111 Interna
honal Relations. He's done jive of the things 01
his mnst-do list, but lie's not telling which ones.
