\\ liai made Saturda\ <i great day? Sunny skies, cool
weather and a chance lor the Stanford women's cross
count r\ team to take a load oil its top-ranked leet at the
( r\still Springs Challenge. Coming oil two weeks of
intense traveling, the (Cardinal was able to alter with its
lineup and still cruise to victon at the low-key compe
tition in nearb\ Belmont.
Most competitors in the race were non-collegiate
scorers Irom club teams. 1 lie race gave the (lardinal a
break from the still'competition it laced .it last week
end s Pre-NCAA Meet in Ames, lowa, where it raced
against other elite squads Irom around the country, in
cluding No. 2 Wisconsin and meet-winner No. .S
Brigham Young.
According to senior captian Flena Villarreal, last
Saturday s (.r\ stal Springs ('.hallenge— as lar from the
pressure ol Ames as Stanford could get — served three
j)urposes lor the squad. First, it allowed the team to
begin employing new competitive strategies. Second,
the meet was an opportunitx to compete without the
stress of a large invitational. Finally, it allowed team
members who have not had main c hances to race for
the Cardinal an opportunity to don their uniforms and
take the line, gi\ing tegular scorers a weekend of rest.
I he Stanford attack on the ('.rvstal Springs course
came from senior Anne Cunnison, junior Colleen
Flaherty, redshirt junior Ann Ramsey, redshirt ju

this season.
Bri/gys competed for the first time this season,
( ruising through the Belmont course to finish third on
the squad. Ramse\ ran compciiiiveh throughout the
race, but turned on the afterburners at the end for an
aggtessive finish lor the fourth Stanford spot.
Scnioi Julia Stamps, one ol 'Stanford's most deco
rated athletes and a distance star even before she liii
the Farm, made an appearance in the Cardinal line
up. Stamps ran the first two miles ol the race as a way
to ease back into the season after a hiatus to recover
from this summer's World Championships. Al
though initialh nervous about competing again.
Stamps ran a strong two miles to regain her old com
petitive spirit.
"We had some impressive times," Villarreal said.
"Anne (Cunnison) had a 10 second PR, and Laura
(Turner) also felt very strong in her race. Overall it
was a ver\ positive experience, a great wa\ to lead
into this weekend's Pac 10s."
In preparation lor the Pacific 10 Championships
this weekend, Stanford's strateg\ is to maintain an ag
