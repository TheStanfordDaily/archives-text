\\ liai made Saturda\ <i great day? Sunny skies, cool
weather and a chance lor the Stanford women's cross
count r\ team to take a load oil its top-ranked leet at the
( r\still Springs Challenge. Coming oil two weeks of
intense traveling, the (Cardinal was able to alter with its
lineup and still cruise to victon at the low-key compe
tition in nearb\ Belmont.
Most competitors in the race were non-collegiate
scorers Irom club teams. 1 lie race gave the (lardinal a
break from the still'competition it laced .it last week
end s Pre-NCAA Meet in Ames, lowa, where it raced
against other elite squads Irom around the country, in
cluding No. 2 Wisconsin and meet-winner No. .S
Brigham Young.
According to senior captian Flena Villarreal, last
Saturday s (.r\ stal Springs ('.hallenge— as lar from the
pressure ol Ames as Stanford could get — served three
j)urposes lor the squad. First, it allowed the team to
begin employing new competitive strategies. Second,
the meet was an opportunitx to compete without the
stress of a large invitational. Finally, it allowed team
members who have not had main c hances to race for
the Cardinal an opportunity to don their uniforms and
take the line, gi\ing tegular scorers a weekend of rest.
I he Stanford attack on the ('.rvstal Springs course
came from senior Anne Cunnison, junior Colleen
Flaherty, redshirt junior Ann Ramsey, redshirt ju
nior Aclrienne Dubin and sophomore Kathleen
Bri/gvs.
(iunnsion and 1 inner finished in the first and sec
ond spots, respectively. I he duo used a convincing
kit k to earn a time of I 7 minutes, seven seconds. (iun
nison achieved a personal record, beating her previ
ous best In M) seconds lor her biggest improvement
this season.
Bri/gys competed for the first time this season,
( ruising through the Belmont course to finish third on
the squad. Ramse\ ran compciiiiveh throughout the
race, but turned on the afterburners at the end for an
aggtessive finish lor the fourth Stanford spot.
Scnioi Julia Stamps, one ol 'Stanford's most deco
rated athletes and a distance star even before she liii
the Farm, made an appearance in the Cardinal line
up. Stamps ran the first two miles ol the race as a way
to ease back into the season after a hiatus to recover
from this summer's World Championships. Al
though initialh nervous about competing again.
Stamps ran a strong two miles to regain her old com
petitive spirit.
"We had some impressive times," Villarreal said.
"Anne (Cunnison) had a 10 second PR, and Laura
(Turner) also felt very strong in her race. Overall it
was a ver\ positive experience, a great wa\ to lead
into this weekend's Pac 10s."
In preparation lor the Pacific 10 Championships
this weekend, Stanford's strateg\ is to maintain an ag
gressive «ind focused attitude. 1 lie (-ardinal — which
boasts one <>l the nation's deepest
rosters and a lop crop of freshman
— i> physically capable of success.
However, its falter at he-NCAAs
demonstrated iliai the team must
make a sliglii mental adjustment.
Stanford's second-place finish at
the meet was an indication that the
Cardinal will have to not only top
the polls but lop the field in order
to .reach its national-title hopes at
the NCAA Championships in late
November.
I he l're-NCAA meet mimic
ked the conditions teams will face
at NCAAs. l'hc Cardinal was able
lo get a feel for the lowa Slate
I niversilx course, where it hopes

to contend lor the title at nation
als. I lie course itself is ver\ rock\
with hilly terrain. Compounded
with still competition from the
nations best teams, ihe meet
gave the Cardinal a true taste of
what to expect at the NCAA
championships and whi( li strate
gies to employ lor success.
( w stal Springs gave the squad a
break from competing against big
name universities and allowed the
Cardinal to locus on meeting the
difficulty of the course.
After a break from major com
petition, the team will travel to
Seattle, Wash., for the l'ac-10
Championships. Its main chal
lenge will likely come from the
home school, No. f> Washington,
and No. I Arizona Stale. 1 he I'ac

conference in women's < l oss coun

tr\. .ind tins season is no different,

compete in the Crystal Springs
Challenge — including Villarreal,
freshmen Jillian Mastroianni and
Victoria Chang, and sophomores

— will likely vie lor the top spots.
Saturday's meet allowed the

much-needed rest in preparation
