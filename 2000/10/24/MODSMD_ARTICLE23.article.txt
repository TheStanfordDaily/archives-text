Oh, how sweet ii is.
So tar this season the No. 2 Stanford men's
soccer team has only lallen to one opponent,
Washington. In Sunday's showdown in Seat
lie iht' (lardinal kept that number at one as
they stomped on the No. 4 I luskies 2-0.
With Sunday's win, along with Friday
night's vic tory over ()regon State, 2-1, Stan
lord improved its already impressive record
to 13-1-1, capturing its 12th shutout of the
season. With the two conference wins, the
team now sits tied atop the conference stand
ings with Washington at 4-1-0.
Like the last time these two teams met,
Sundav's match was not an easv one. Never
theless, coming up big lor the (lardinal were
seniors Sean Sylvis, with one goal, and (lorev
Woolfolk who added one goal and one assist.
I n the 23th minute of play, Sylvis received
.i pass from Wool folk and put away his sec
ond game-winner of the weekend. It would
not be until 89:29 that Woolfolk put the
game out of reach as he put awa\ his fifth goal
on the year.
Despite the shutout, Washington had op
portunities. In the first half, Stanford
watched as the I luskies had a lew near miss
es. As tlu- game progressed ilir Cardinal
managed to settle down and got things going
when Woolfolk made a great pla\ bv running
down a long ball and feeding ii across to
Sylvis.
In the second half, the Cardinal came out

in a fury, looking to lake over the game, but
as lime came close lo expiring, ii was nothing
short of an all-out battle. Both teams had
their moments ol brilliance, bin as the closing
minutes dawned Washington was tbreed to
focus on ollensive opportunities. As a result,
the Cardinal began to take advantage ol the
holes left in the defense. Eventually, Wool
folk would get behind the back row and fin
ish the game lor good.
"Washington was a tough, tough game,"
said senior Derek Shanahan. "They are a
very talented. 1 he\ are a very confident,
solid, composed team at their stadium, and
anyone should be happy with a good result
when playing away at Washington."
Friday's game, when the Cardinal trav
eled to play ()regon State, was not as strong
as Sunday's performance, but Svlvis again
prevailed to give Stanford the win.
Due to poor field conditions, it did not
take long for the game to get out of hand with
both teams scrambling for the ball. But the
(lardinal settled the pace down and began to
play its stvle of soccer.
At the 19:15 mark Stanford, put the first
points on the board as senior Luke Rust put
awa\ a pass from Matt Moses. With tfie store,
Rust tied senior Scott Leber for the team's
leading scorer, at nine goals.
Stanford held the lead until tlie 85th
minute of play when Oregon State's James
Albert's shot deflected oil a (Cardinal defend
er <Â»nd past senior Adam Zapala. With the

".line lied .U 1-1 llie })ressure was
oil, bin Stanford look care oi busi
ness. Sophomore defender lodd
Dunivani tarried ihe ball down
the left suit- and connected with a
streaking Sylvis who banged a
header past the ()regon Slate goal
keeper.

Afiet these two wins Stanford is
dosing in on a regular season atop
ihe I'ac-10 and gelling a liome
lield bid lor ihe NCAA I ourna
meni. Willi only lour games re
maining in the season this week
end's momentum will be critical.
In ihe next two weeks .Stanford
faces \'<>. 7 I ( lA, (ialilornia, ()re
gon State and No. ~> Indiana, as it
looks to become the top-ranked
team in the country. It will be a bat
tle not only to win the rest of the

games, but to win over the polls.
"1 would hesitate to say that
rankings will change much this
weekend," Shanahan said. "1
think all the losses [No. 7] UCIJV,
[No. 14J Creighton and [No. 10]
Virginia will shake things up, but
those people seem reluctant to
claim tli.it we're a No. 1 team.
Our locus is on the next four
games as we now have a lop seed
in the sights for Ihe [NCAA]
tournament."
