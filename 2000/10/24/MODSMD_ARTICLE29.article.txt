## Cost increases, more financial assistance not unique to Stanford 
### NICHOLAS CHAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last week, the College Board reported an in
crease in both college tuition and financial aid
throughout the nation. Stanford has joined the
trend b\ increasing tuition f> percent this year and
setting aside $6 million lor financial aid.
I he 24-page tuition report, titled "Trends in Col
lege Pricing 20(H)," reported a 5.2 percent tuition in
crease from an average of $15,518 to $16,332 at
four-year private schools. The average tuition at
lour-vear public schools increased 4.4 percent from
$3,362 to $3,510.
Stanford's tuition rose from $23,058 to
$24,44 1. I lie I niversitv justified its increase by
citing more undergraduate programs such as
the Stanford Introductory Studies, a Bay Area
Consumer Price Index that was twice the na
tional rate Irom 1998 to 1999 and higher hous
ing costs that affect professors and graduate
students.
1 uition continues to increase for the simple
reason that Stanford's costs continue to increase
•is well," said John Bravman, vice provost for un
dergraduate educat ion.
Although this \ear's increase may seem large,
tuition has been increasing since the early '80s,
according to the report. In the last ten years, the
average four-year public tuition increased by 51
percent while ilie average four-year private tu
ition increased by 35 percent.
Despite these figures, the West still has the lowest
average lour-vear public-school tuition while the
Southwest holds the lowest average four-year pri
vate-school tuition. The Hast Coast has the highest
average tuition lor both public and private schools.
I larvard's tuition is $22,694, Princeton's tuition
is $25,430 and Yale's tuition is $25,220. In-state tu
ition at I'( '.-Berkeley is $3,964.
fo balance these rising costs, a record $68 billion
was available ibis year nationwide in financial aid.
I bis figure represents a I percent increase from last
year and is part ofa 90 percent increase over the last
decade. Loans represent 59 percent of this aid.
"In a time ol rising costs, Stanford remains
committed to providing one of the most extensive
financial aid programs in the nation," said James
Montoya, vice provost for student affairs. This is
the third consecutive year that Stanford has in
creased its aid offerings.
1 n addition, Stanford officials have taken sever
al other measures to improve the financial aid

At his inauguration Friday, University Presi
dent John Hennessy announced a five-year capi
tal campagin to raise $ 1 billion for undergraduate
eduction. Of this money, $300 million will go to
endowed financial aid.
Even with this campaign and t lis year's increases
in tuition, Stanford tuition only covers 60 percent of
the complete cost of an undergraduate education,
according to University statistics. Donations and
money from the University's endowment fund
cover the remaining 40 percent.
