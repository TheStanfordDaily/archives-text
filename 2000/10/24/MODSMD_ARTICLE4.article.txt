Although some students have said they've
notic ed an iiu 1 eased polite presence on cam
pus lately, the Stanford Department ol Pub
lic Safety said that tumors of a crackdown on
hike safety are unfounded.
"I'm not sure '( rackingdown' is an appro
priate term, hut if t here is ,i problem area we
may apply all of our resources to enforce Un
law there," said Deputy Harris kuhn of the
Stanford Polite. He added that overall "our
enforcement has been piett\ much constant
and consistent with our ability to employ our
resources."
With an estimated 15.000 bicyclists
whizzing along Stanford's roadways and
sidewalks, the potential f<>i accidents is high.
The Department of Public Safety is currently
attempting to minimize the number ol inci
dents not only by cnlon ing the law but also
by educating the community.
Dan Smith, a manager in the depart
ments Special Servites I nit. stressed that of
fit c*rs are not out to get bicyclists.

We're bike rulers 100, so we re not ap
proaching this si lie iln Ironi an enforcement
point of view. Smith said "Whenever we do
enforcement, we like to educate as well. I lie
two go hand in hand.
Despite his assurances, some students are
put oil In what they perceive as excessive en
forcement ol bicvcle laws.
"People get upset and ask, 'Don't you have
anvthing belter to do?' Kulm said. "I he
truth is. we don't, in the sense that the largest
number ol incidents we deal with are bicvcle
related."
Students have pointed to police cruisers
stationed around campus as evidence that
the department is cracking down on bicycle
offenders iliis kill. Several, including sopho
more |enn\ Ifildner, have already been
pulled over lor violations ranging Irom im

Despite student concern about a police crackdown on bike safety, officers reported no change
in their enforcement policies. Representatives from the Stanford Department of Public Safety say
their goal is education in addition to enforcement.
passing a car stopped at a stop
sign and proceeding through the
intersection.
"I saw the police car, but I
thought [the driver of the stopped
vehicle] was waiting for me to go
by, so I kept going and [the oflicer]
pulled me over," 1 lildner said. She
said that while she was annoyed by
the inconvenience of being
stopped, she doesn't think that the
enforcement of bike laws on cam
pus is a bad thing overall.
I lildner was warned but did not
receive a citation.
The current problem areas
being targeted are intersections,
where bicyclists tend to ignore the
stop signs, according to Ruhn.

"Today 1 cited a gentleman [on a
bike] who ran through a stop sign
straight into the women's cross
country team," Ruhn said.
"Unless it's a blind corner, I
just slow down," said Eric Berger,
a freshman who bikes to (lass
daily. "1 don't stop if there's no
one coming."
"When I see a stop sign, 1 don't
consciously think that I 'm ignoring
it," freshman Chelsea Trotter said.
"I usually just go through it be
cause I think of it as being meant
for the cars."
In addition to stopping students
for moving violations, police have
been citing them lor driving with
out bike registration or without
proper lighting at night, fhe Cali
fornia Vehicle (lode requires a light
on the front and a rellector on the
rear of any bike that is used at night.
While some cyclists may see

these as trilling concerns, Smith
and Ruhn said they believe they are
important in building a communit)
that is aware of bicycle safety issues.
"If someone doesn't have a
light, a car might not see them and
there could be a serious accident,"
said Ruhn.
According to Smith, "There's a
perception that there are a whole
bunch of officers out there trying
to pull people over, but in fact
there are only a lew of us out there
at a time.
"Our resources out on patrol
at e typically limited. I hat's win
we locus on education," he added.
Smith said he sees bicvcle salet)
as an issue in which the police and
citizens should be on the same side.
"We have a passion about this.
We're trying our best to promote
safety and common sense, but we
need the community's help."
