Alumni from the classes of I'.MO to
1995 who were back on campus this
weekend Ibi Reunion I lomecoming IiOOO
have some advice for current students —
have fun, try something new and don't
get too ( aught up with work.
Past graduates returned to the Farm
in droves, bringing with them experi
ences and life lessons, most of which
were not learned in the classrooms here
at Stanford.
Andy Wilson Koont/, 'K5, said it is too
easy to get caught up in studying.
"That's something the Stanford un
dergrad has t<> light against," Koont/said.
"Kxperiencc .ill \<>u can at this wonderful
plate, but be sure to leave some time for
friends, because that's why vou're going

lobe coining back for these homecomings
— not because of the score you got on
your Knglish midterm.
Doug I Listings. 'I I. said he enjoyed his
time at Stanford even though his college
experience was a bit different, as it oc
curred during World War 11. But Hast

"We were a smaller c lass in those days;
the entire fresh man grade lived together

think I knew just about everybody . . . . 1
think that cohesion and sense ol belong

undergraduates. It's the friends, it realh
is. that's wh\ anvone belongs anywhere."

more to do with throwing water balloons
at janitors than time spent in ( lass, he said.
"Of course we got an education," he
said. "We got a great one. but that's beside
the point."
Some alumni took awav more from
their years at Stanford than just a degree.
Doris Cooper (.arisen, '50, met her
husband while experimenting with the
I niversity's new education major.
"Basically, I became an education
major along with half of my ( lass, be
cause it was the first vear the option was
offered, and I've been teaching ever
since," she said.
During ( arlsen's time at Stanford, the
I niversit\ was expanding in more places
than just its curriculum selection, faking
