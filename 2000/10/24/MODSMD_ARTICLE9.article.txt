students are not fluent in English.

not want to weaken the graduation requirements, but be

UC-Davis settles sex-bias
suit for $600,000
The University of California at Davis agreed this
month to pay $000,000 in a settlement to a former profes
sor who sued the university in federal court three years
ago for sex discrimination.
In 1990, half of the voting members of the English de
partment backed the tenure bid of Margit Stange. But she
was denied tenure by Larry N. Vanderhoef. the chancel
lor, and Carol Tomlinson-Keasey, who was the vice
provost, and given a one-year terminal position within the
department.
Ms. Stange, who is currently an affiliated scholar at the
Institute for Research on Women and Gender at Stan
ford University, argued that those who opposed her pro
motion at Davis were motivated by gender bias. " There
was a pattern of cold and dismissive treatment bv some se
nior male professors in the department toward junior
women faculty members," she said in an interview. "They
would not greet us."
