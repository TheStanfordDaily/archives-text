Muhammad's father Jamal, tries to shield him.
"Don't shoot", Jamal shouts to Israeli troops.
On September 30, the life of 12 year-old
Mohammed Al-Durah ended in a storm of
Israeli hullets as he sought shelter in his
father's arms. Since then, more than 100
Palestinians have been killed, at least 30 of
them children.
An ambulance driver who attempted to
rescue the boy was also killed. The
Palestinian Red Crescent Society reports
that 28% of its ambulances have been hit
by Israeli fire. A field hospital clearly
bearing the Red Crescent emblem was fired
on by an Israeli attack helicopter.
Israel is dependent on the United States for
its military strength. Each year Israel
receives $ 1.8 billion in US military grants.
Israel has brought shame to the US by
using American made weaponry to kill
civilian demonstrators. This is a violation
of LIS law. In repressing these demonstra
tions, Israel is using heavy weapons such as
anti-tank rockets and Apache helicopters.
They are also using snipers.
Make no mistake, the underlying cause of
this conflict is Israel's refusal to recognize -
basic Palestinian human rights. While Ariel
Sharon's provocative visit to the Al-Aqsa —
compound sparked the recent violence, the
root cause of the anger being expressed is
decades of abusive Israeli occupation. £
