1940
On October 25, 1940, The Daily ran a
special on Stanford's current fashion
trends.
"Skirts! What's to be said about them?
"They're the hardy perennial of every
campus wardrobe 112 rom Maine to Califor
nia. Properly combined with assorted jack
ets, sweaters, shirts and blouses, they make
up about 90 percent of that exclusive Stan
ford fashion category, Quad (llothcs.
"Biggest news about them in the East
ihis fall is that they're short. No, we don't
mean 19 or 20 inches. We mean way up
about the knee! (College girls at such sup
posedlv dignified institutions as Smith and
Vassal* and debutantes in all the belter so
cial circles parade calmly around campus
and golf courses with their knees on view
and their calves colorfully sheathed in high
wool stockings.
"These knee-length creations come in
practically every color, style and sports ma
terial. Wool, gabardine, flannel, plaids,
stripes, solid colors, flared, gored,
pleated â€” they're .ill the latest thing so
long .is they stop .it the knee. Indispens
able accessory is a pair of knee-length wool
stockings in matching or contrasting color
or colors."
Bottom line: Fashion trends always begin with a
bold first step. What would frat parties be like
today if skirts had never made it above the
knee?
