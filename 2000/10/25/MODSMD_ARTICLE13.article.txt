Stanford had not practiced the
play all week. Stanford hadn't run
the play once in Saturday's game
against USC. Stanford waited until
there were four seconds left to call it
for the first time.
And Stanford won the game be
cause of the play.
The play is called Rattler " and it
certainly lived up to its name Satur
day,, because it bit the heck out of
USC in Stanford's 32-30 victory.
On fourth down from the USC 20
and with four seconds left, Stanford
quarterback Chris Lewis took the
snap, dropped back a few steps and
lofted a pass into the right corner of
the end zone toward a wide-open
Jamien McCullum.
