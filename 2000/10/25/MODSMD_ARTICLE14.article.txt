## US, Jordan agree on free trade deal 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The United
Scales and Jordan reached agreement
yesterday on a precedent-setling free
trade deal that lor the first time would
protect labor rights and environmental
standards, long a goal of two major
1 )emoct atic constituencies.
The deal, which would remove all
trade barriers between the two nations
over tlie next 10 years, is onh the fourth
such pact the I niled States has with
other countries. I lie others are with
Canada, Mexico and Israel.
Congress must approve the agree
ment before it takes ellect, but its fate is
uncertain given Republican opposition
to linking trade* with labor and the envi
ronment. I lie Clinton administration
said the pact will not be sent to Congress
for approval until next year.
The negotiations, which began only
this vear, were completed in record time
for such significant issues because of the
personal interest of both President Clin
ton and King Abdullah of Jordan.
( linton saw the pact as a wav to bolster
a principal I .S. partner in the Middle
Fast peace process and at I lie same time
sei the labor-environment precedent for
a trade deal. The I nited Stales wanted to
do that with last vear's failed effort by the
World Trade ()i gani/ation to launch new
global trade i.ilks in Seattle.
While the agreement to eliminate all

barriers to trade between the two
nations was seen as having little eco
nomic impact in the United States
because the volume of trade is so small,
ii could give an important boost to Jor
dan's struggling economy by encour
aging investment by firms seeking
export opportunities to the United
States.
Abdullah has made reform of Jor
dan's economy a main goal since he took
over leadership after the February 1099
death of Ins father, King I lussein.
Labor unions and environmental
groups. Democratic constituencies that
Vice President Al Core is trying to court
in his presidential bid, praised the labor
and environmental safeguards in the Jor
dan deal as a small but important first
step.
Anti-globali/ation forces have
( barged that by ignoring those consider
ations trade agreements encourage a
race to the bottom in which poor coun
tries follow lax standards as a way to
attract manufacturing jobs away from
the United Slates and other developed
countries.
AFL-CIO President John Sweeney
called the U.S.-Jordan agreement "a
small step toward our ultimate goal of
making workers' rights and environ
mental protections an integral part of
universally applied trade rules."
