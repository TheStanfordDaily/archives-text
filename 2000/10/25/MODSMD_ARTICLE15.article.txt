EDWARDS AIR F( )R( .E BASK, (lalil.
(AP) — Space shuttle Discovery and 11 s
seven astronauts landed in California's
Mojave Desert yesterday after danger
ously high wind prevented a touchdown
in Florida for the third day in a row.
The shuttle swooped through a clear
sky and touched down on the runwa\ at
Edwards Air Force Base about 2 p.m.,
ending a 13-day flight during which the
astronauts got the international spate
station ready for the arrival of its first
full-time residents next week.
It was the 100 th space shuttle flight for
NASA and the first time in I I 2 years that
a shuttle was detoured to California. I lie
shuttle /oomed across the Pacific and
tight over Los Angeles, then northward
into Edwards on the final approach.
"Welcome back to Earth after a super
successful mission," Mission Control said
after Discover) rolled to a safe stop.
"Great to be back," replied comman
der Brian Dully.
Gusts of close to 30 mph forced NASA
to pass up a landing attempt at Cape
Canaveral, l la., earlier in the day. 1 lie
wind also kept the shuttle from landing
in Florida on Sunday and Monday, while
rain clouds at Edwards on Monday scut
tled landing plans there.
To the astronauts' relief, the weathei
was ideal at Edwards yesterday.
"After a rough couple days of weath
er, Edwards is giving you the best it has
to offer," Mission Control said.
During their flight. Dully and his
crew installed two new segments on the
outside of the space station and also

spruced up the inside for the three men
who will be moving in lor lour months.
I hey conducted four spaccwalks on four
consecutive clavs, an exceptional — and
exhausting — amount of work.
I he astronauts toiled from morning
to night, from the time they rocketed
into orbit on Oct. 1 I until their depar
ture from the space station on Friday.
A broken antenna and a short circuit
made then work even more difficult.
Shuttle program manager Ron Ditte

more gave the astronauts an "A-plus" ibi
their eflbrts.
" I his one's going to be hard t<
beat," he said at a news conlerenct
alter landing.
Now the spotlight slnlts to Russia an<
ka/akstan.
Astronaut Hill Shepherd and two cos
monauts ate scheduled to lilt oil aboarc
.1 Russian Soyuz rocket from Kazakstai
on Oct. :51. They will arrive at the 240
mile-high space station two days later.
