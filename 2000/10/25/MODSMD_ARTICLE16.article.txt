on the financial support of Stan
lord alumni. I hough alumni have long
been .1 source ol funding for the I niversi

alumni with current undergraduate expe
riences. Ill is development is both promis

Since its merge with the University, the
Alumni Association has increased focus on
eliciting alumni donations. And. so far, this
campaign lias met with unprecedented suc

Alumni Association has a two-pronged strat

reach out to all alumni — benefactors or not
— in unprecedented ways.
lake, for example, the new Frances C.
Arrillaga Alumni (lenter, located 011 the coi -
ner of Calvez and Campus Drive. The vision
for this center is to create a home for alum
ni that is, according to the center's Web site,
"a place for education and friendship,
where alumni can woi k with each other and
the I niversitv on common goals." I bis loca
tion is central to athletics, performing arts
and academic life. Placed in such a promi
nent position, it symbolizes Stanford's

inunitv of life-long learners.
Another attempt to enliven alumni sup
poi 1 at Stanford is burgeoning in the foi 111 of
communitx service. Filled "Heart lalk." .111
emerging Alumni Association program

encourages Stanford alumni to engage in
service projects in their communities.
I he Alumni Association is also finding
wa\s to involve alumni with on-canipus stu
dent volunteer organizations. These new
programs will stimulate new growth in com
munity service at Stanford.
For students peering out at the great
beyond, the Alumni Association has estab
lished the Stanford Career Network, a
resource tli.it enables interested students to
learn from the work experiences of gradu
ates. This network allows students to form
contacts with alumni and to seek advice
about a wide range of career possibilities.
I I1 is is a fabulous first step, as a career
mentoring program will be invaluable for
establishing strong links between alumni
and the I diversity Not to mention the fact

that, for students, it will help demystify life
beyond Stanford.
The Student Alumni Network, which is
responsible for such campus traditions as
Full Moon on the Quad and the "All Right
Now ' dance during Homecoming Week
end, also encourages mentor programs. It
should continue to develop as a strong link
between alumni and students.
It is clear that the Campaign for Under
graduate Kducation is far more than a fund
raiser. It is another step toward fostering a
vibrant relationship among alumni, students
and the University. The time is ripe fora
true community of life-long learners, in
which students, alumni and the University
are all mutuallv supportive resources for
each other. The Alumni Association is taking
great strides toward achieving this goal.
