Stanford has its pub nights, but onl\ one
( lass can attend.
Something must be done.
Its not enough to protest the abun
dance ol cars on this campus and
ignore the absence ol pubs, or vice
versa. vvhen llieie is ,i single solution for
hoth dilemmas.
I propose a change in the wa\ our
government mulct s responsibility upon
its vouth. Currently, at the age ol lf> or
17, Americans are permitted to (hive, to
the marked consternation ol evervone
else on the road.
I sa\, let's give our vouth the option
upon turning 1 7 of one ol two ( hoiccs: a
license to drive oi a license to drink.
Choose one and fbrleit the other till
you re 21. The immediate benefits
include fewer cars on the road, fewer
teenagers behind the wheel and an end
to the stale-sanctioned farce that it 20-
year-old is not responsible enough to
have a beer.
W rite your representatives, write your
governor, write the president. Whether
vol fre set on saving Ihe planet or just
having a good time, join the movement!
And, most importantly, choose wisely.

Mhlhicl loth is a senior majoring in history.
Ili' is making llie worl/l a bet In place.
