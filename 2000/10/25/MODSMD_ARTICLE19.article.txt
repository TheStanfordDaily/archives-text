Another Stanford category:
'Psuedo-intellectual cynic'
I w.is delighted lo read Daniel Dono
van's incisive column on the di.siinclions
ill.n luiii|) Stanford students into sucli
categories as "Fngineers," " Pseudo-art s\
rovers,' and "Sororiu nerds. However, I
It'll that lie missed one. Pseudo-intellectu
al cvnic: I'liese folks are beyond catego
ri/ation — for it is the\ who make the cat
egories.
Standing behind .1 veil ol intellectual
elitism, tlif pseudo-intellect is free to
debase evcrvonc and everything ,is lack
ing in sophistication. Me or she regards
popular culture or, as the\ might sav, "the
masses."' as grossly banal — something to
be mot ked and avoided at all costs.
I lie pseudo-intellect towers above our
base aesthetics: listening not to Britnev
Spears but John (.oltrane's avant-garde
recordings, believing not in religion but
esoteric French Philosophv, and prefer
ring subtitled films to 11<>11\ wood summer
bloc'kbustet s.
I hey will be c|uick to point out that
your desire to dance to loud 'NOs music at
a I rat party is a mark of tasteless confor
mity and that your computet science
liiaioi defines von as a soulless monster

fueled by material greed. And, when all of
this analysis is through, they might even
write a column about it.

Republicans received
inhospitable treatment
As registered Republicans, we attend
ed i lie Ralph Nader and Medea Ben
jamin event Monday night expecting to
have fundamental disagreements with
the- speakers, but hoping to gain «i better
understanding ol then position. We
expected to be in the political minority
and, iu I act, the audience was comprised
almost entireK of Democrats. What we
did not expect was to be the tat get ol boo
ing and hissing upon indicating our polit
ical position in Benjamin's informal,
opening poll.
I lie behavior ol those who hissed is
insulting, rude and immature, it demon
strates a basic lack ol understanding
about political disagreement. Political
opposition is an essential element of our
democracy. However, personal attacks
launched because of One's beliefs serve

only to diminish our regard for each
oilier as people.
Ralph Nader may think our candidate is
»>nl\ disguising himsell as a human Ix'ing.
but at least the Republicans in attendance
tonight we re < apahle <>l acting respectfully,
even as we disagreed. We would ask cam
pus I )emocrats to do the same.
