Officials from the United States Postal Service, the University and the ASSU attend a ribbon-cut
ting ceremony at the post office yesterday.
Along with its new theme, the
post of lice has also adopted the
concept of "open merchandising"
or displaying its products in the
store.
Students have approved of
most of the new changes.
I like] the fact that the boxes
are indoors and there's a lot more
room in the lobby," said sopho
more Matt (lornwell.
However, there are still some
kinks to be worked out.
"It's brighter and happier but
their lines still suck," Cornwell
said. "It's a more pleasant place to
be frustrated."
But the Postal Service is al
ready working to improve the
postal store.
"We have someone aware and
available when the lines are long
in older to help the students get
through the line without a long
wait," Kelly said.
