# Community Farm aims for sustainablity

### COLLEEN O'BRIEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Leaders of Stanford's only
"farm on the Farm" are currently
aiming for structure and sustain
ability in a group that already
brims with energy and dedication.
Established as a volunteer stu
dent organization four years ago,
the Stanford Community Farm
operates on a one-acre plot of
campus land originally granted to
union workers in the 19705. The
plot was virtually abandoned after
the drought of the 1980s. In 1996,
Brian Halweil, then a senior ma
joring in earth systems, proposed
the creation of a student-run or
ganic farm.
Since its establishment in 1997,
the farm has flourished under stu
dent leadership. It uses bio-inten
sive farming methods, avoiding
artificial fertilizers and machin
ery. Its focus is to spread an
awareness of sustainable agricul
ture and to educate students
about organic food production as
an alternative to big agribusiness.
More than simply gardening,
students in the group form a
working community.
"It's a place where students can
get their hands dirty," said farm
manager Emily Leslie, a senior.
In contrast to the abstract
world of academia, work on the
farm is straightforward and yields
tangible results, students believe.
"It's so easy," said junior ()livia
Para. "You plant a seed, you water
it and it grows."
The farm's only current fund
ing, a budget of $800 per year
from the ASSU, goes to supplies,
repairs and publicity.
The farm generates additional
funds by selling its harvest,
though thus fat sales have been
limited.
"Part of our vision includes eco
nomic sustainability." King said.

Lately, managers have encour
aged students to contribute to the
farm's overall plan rather than
simply cultivating individual plots.
The results have been in
creased bio-diversity, improved
soil quality and a sense that the
workers are more familiar with the
land and ecosystem of the farm.
The farm also provides oppor
tunities for students to learn prac
tical skills and to apply firsthand
the concepts they learn in the
classroom. In fact, until last year,
the Earth Systems Department of
fered two academic units per
quarter for independent work on
the farm.
Recently, however, the depart
ment replaced that opportunity
with a regular c lass in sustainable
agriculture that does not involve
work on the farm, leaving the
group with less direct connection
to the University.
"We're trying to integrate
more, to have the farm be a more
permanent part of Stanford,"
Leslie said.
Because actually sustaining the
farm requires so much effort, the
management has had little oppor
tunity to focus on outreach and re
cruiting. However, last year the
farm held its first farmer's market
in White Plaza and plans to repeat
it this year.
The farm holds open workdays
on Thursdays from p.m. to sun
down and Sundays from 2 p.m. to
sundown. They also plan to hold
workshops on these days, with
guest experts speaking on a variety
of topics including native (California
plants, orchard care and worms.
Most importantly, the farm
hopes to obtain a grant fora full
time staff position starting this
summer.
"Summer is probably the
hardest time in terms of mainte
nance because so many students
leave," said Manager Cynthia
King, a senior.
