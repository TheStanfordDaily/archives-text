fonight, in observation of Diwali -
known also as the "festival of lights" - the
Hindu Students ( Council will Ik- holding a
small peoja, or religious ceremony, at 7:30
p.m. in the Toyon main lounge.
"[Diwali] has special significance to
Hindus, but is celebrated by people of all
religions," said sophomore Sumir
Meghani, co-coordinator of the Hindu
Students (Council."In this regard, it is
quite similar to (Christmas. In India, for
example, Muslims and (Christians alike
take part in Diwali celebrations."
Last year's Nov. 6 Diwali celebration at
Stanford was a hit. The event, organized
by tlie Stanford India Association, attract
ed so many students there wasn't enough
room in the Bechtel International (Center

to seat them all.
This year's show will be on Nov. 4 at
kresge Auditorium.
"Diwali Show 2000 is special because,
I or the first time, we are combining forces
with SIA and doing one show together,"
Ajmani said. "Up until now they've had
their own show."
According to Ajmani, the audience can
«'\pect to see a mixture of classical and folk
dancing and singing, cameos by a wide va
riety of Indian instruments and Bharat
natayam - a type of classical Indian dance.
The show will conclude with a game of
Antakshari, in which one team begins
singing a film song, and the next team
must begin singing a different song start
ing with the last word of the previous song.
()ther activities are in the making.
"We're [also] thinking of arranging a
Rangoli competition at the venue, a cou
ple hours before the actual program,"
said graduate student Manali Hotankar,
a member of the Stanford India Associa

tion. "Entrances of houses are made col
orful with lovely traditional motifs of
Rangoli designs to welcome the gods and'
g< uldesses."
(Catered Indian food will be available
before the show as well, said Ajmani.
"We hope to have an assortment of
samosas [vegetable pastries], pakoras [veg
etable fritters] and some traditional
sweets," she said.
Usually a quick sell-out, Diwali Show
2000 advance tickets will be on sale from
Oct M). to Nov in White Plaza. Admis
sion is $8 lor Stanford students and $10
general; tic kets at the door are $10.
Others agree there are significant par
allels between Diwali (pronounced dee-
WALLY) and other popular festivals.
"In the past, Diwali was primarily a
Hindu celebration but now has been
adopted by people of all backgrounds,"
said sophomore Neha Ajmani, a member
ol Sanskrit is Special Events commit lee. "It
is something that is celebrated throughout

India."
According to Meghani, poojas do not
necessarily have to occur during a holiday
- an individual can perform a pooja in 11 is
or her home every evening.
"A 'pooja,' or puja,' is just the term for
performing a prayer or religious ceremo
ny," Meghani said. "The name of the holi
day is Diwali and hence this is a Diwali
pooja."
"During the pooja tomorrow, we will
oiler a multitude of items to the Gods, in
finding rice, milk, water, honey and ghee,
a derivative of butter," Meghani said.
The true origins of Diwali are open to
interpretation. In northern India, the fes
tival celebrates Lord Rama's homecoming
from exile after his defeat of the evil
demon Ravana. Elsewhere, Diwali honors
the goddess of wealth, Lakshmi. But in all
areas, Diwali signifies the renewal of life
and the triumph of righteousness over
spiritual darkness.
In preparation for the live-day festival

and to welcome the goddess Lakshmi,
people fast, cleanse themselves and tidy
their homes. Businessmen also initiate a
cleansing of sorts, known as "chopda
puja," when they begin writing in their
new accounts during this time.
"It is also common for people to put up
colored lights around their homes, light
c andles, lamps, and firecrackers and deco
rate their floors with colors," said sopho
more \ikhil Achwal, co-coordinator of the
Hindu Students Council. "People also
wear new clothes 011 the day of the festival
and visit friends and neighbors. It's just a
very happy occasion.''
In keeping with tradition from a time
when lights and candles were not avail
able, people still celebrate Diwali with clay
lamps. The lamps are also symbols of
good's triumph over darkness, and Light's
over Dark.
"I finduism is such that nothing is out
side its folds,' Meghani said. "Everyone is
welcome."
