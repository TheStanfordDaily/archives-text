### BILL BOWEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Fhe ASSU Undergraduate Senate discussed ideas
to improve the University's undergraduate advising
program at its meeting last night. ASSI' representa
tives will present their proposals in an upcoming Fac
ulty Senate meeting.
The undergraduate advising program received
mixed reviews l'rotn the senators, some describing it as
"excellent,'' others as "a nightmare experience."
"1 don't know how they choose people for these po
sitions (as student advising associates)," said Senator
Anna Otieno, a sophomore. "Some students have ad
visers that meet with them once a month while others
have advisers that don't even know their names."
()tieno suggested that this discrepancy might he al
leviated In a more selective application process. Sena
tor Mike (Xsolskv, a sophomore, suggested the appli
cation process could be better publicized, perhaps In
setting up an application table in White Plaza neat the
application deadline.
()ther proposals included increasing incentives lot
good advising, including cash awards and recognition
by the ASSU. Though the I ndergraduate Advising
(lenter already oilers awards for the best acl\ isers each
year, the ASSI hopes that expanding ad\ isei recogni
tion will provide advisers a greater incentive to fulfill

their duties well.
Assistant Dean ol Students Nanci Ilowe and ASSU
Vice President Malia Villegas, a senior, encouraged
Senate members to get more student input before pre
senting their proposals.
"I think before you speak to the Faculty Senate you
need to have a clear focus on what you like about ad
vising and what you would like to see different," 1 lowe
said.
Senator (lharlene Ng, a junior, agreed that the pro
gram needs improvement but questioned whether the
advising center was at fault for the poor quality of its
advisers.
"It's reallv dillicult to get good advising associates
when it's all volunteer," she said.
In other action, the Senate approved funding for
several student groups. Circle K, the Russian Club,
I IwaTae Kvvan Do & I lapkidoClub, Stanford C College
Bowl and Bent Spoon all received the funding they re
quested from the appropriations committee.
Fhe Senate also approved allowing the Stanford
Band access to its reserve funds a subject of some de
bate last week. Fhe band will use the fimds fora road
trip to Washington this fall, because the summer trip
for which they had previously requested the reserve
funds fell through.
I lie Senate will vote to approve nominations to the
Constitutional Council next week.
