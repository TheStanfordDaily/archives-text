### MINAYO NAISALI CONTRIBUTING WRITE 
With tour first-place finishes in
five meets this season, the hihgly
ranked women's cross country
team is primed and pumped for
this weekend's Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships.
This Saturday's Pac-lOs will be
held in Seattle, Wash., in Lincoln
Park. <md is expected to he a hotly
contested meet. Four teams are
vying for the title including No .2
Stanford, No. 4 Arizona Stale, No.
(i Washington, and No. S Arizona.
Although the level of competi
tion in this meet is much higher
i han that of last weekend's Crystal
Springs Invitational, the Cardi
nal. fueled by the extra competi
tion, is more than motivated to se
cure its fifth- consecutive title.
Last year's Pa-10s were domi
nated by then-freshman Li in Sul
livan's impressive first-place fin
ish and Stanford's sweep of the
top three places. Only the second
freshman to claim the individual
title, Sullivan is looking to become
the third to repeat as the women's
conference champion, joining
Karen Hecox of UCLA, and Amy
Skicres/. of Ai i/.ona.
While Sullivan led the charge
last year, she was followed closely
by then-senior Sally Glynn and
then-freshman Lauren Fleslnnan.
The strength of this year's
team is found in both the sea
soned veterans, like Sullivan and

Fleslnnan — now sophomores —
and redshirt junior team captain
Elena Villarreal as well .is fresh
men like Jillian Mastroianni <111(1

schools are participating with
teams of seven. 1 lowever. the si/e

occasion."
With only one (Cardinal team
entered in the Pac-l()s, Stan

importance of locus and aggres

with a purpose," Kvans said.

of what the end result will be.
