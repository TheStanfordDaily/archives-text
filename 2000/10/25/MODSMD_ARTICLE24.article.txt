I ony Azevedo's water polo ca
reer is 011 cruise control. Willi
eyes as blue as the Aven pool
where he practices, and deeper
si ill with determination, llie Stan
ford diiver is the best water polo
player the United Slates, and per
haj )s the world, has ever seen.
At 18, lie's alread) an accom
plished veteran of the sport — he
just competed in the Olympic
Gaines in Svdney and was recent
ly named to the All-World Team,
<m honor given to the top eleven
players in the world.
"Fora competitoi to be this
strong at such a young age un
heard of. The United States has
never had a player this good."
said Dante Dettamanti, the Stan
ford men's water polo coach.
Not only was Azevedo the
youngest playet on the U.S. na
tional water polo team since the
current selection process began
in 1972, but he was the second
highest scorer for the U.S. and
sixth overall at the liames. Near
ly a decade younger than the av
erage water polo Olympian (27),
Azevedo would not be deterred
from his goals.
"When I started playing on the
national team back in 19%, ai
first it was a big deal. I was so
much younger than the othci
players. Then I realized I can't
play like a young gu\, he said.

A/.e\ed< > is all eadv being com

sidered ilu- finest player in water
polo history, live-time Ohmpian
Manuel l.siiarte ol Spain. Voled
i he top young male plaver in the
world by Water Polo magazine
earlier this year, and unofficially
referred to as the lop high school
player in the last .">() years. A/eve
do has a reputation lo uphold.
"I le isasquit k as can be," john
Vargas, llie U.S. men's Olympic
water polo coach, told NBC.

"And it's not necessarily a physi
cal thing; it's in his head. He can
read plays belore they happen. It
was like he was born to play this
sport."
It helps to have a parent who
understands the rigors of compe
tition. Tony's father. Ricardo, was
a two-time player of the year in
Brazil and assistant coach for the
199b U.S. Olympic team. Tony
got his first taste lor I lie high level
of international competition in
199b, when he worked lor his fa-

I her as a ball boy.
"Ii was at the 1996 Summer
Games when I decided I had to
make it," Tony said.
Ricardo introduced his son to
water polo alter the family moved
to Southern California. Growing
up in Long Beach was the perfect
selling fora natural athlete like
Tony to excel in many sports, in
cluding football, basketball, base
ball and volleyball.

"I actually got to be a pretty
<r« >< k 1 baseball player, but one day
I jumped into the water and that
was it."he said.
B\ ninth grade, Azevedo
turned bis entire lot us to water
polo as bis lather built a dynasty
coaching at Long Heath Wilson
School. In November 1999,
Wilson became the first team in 20
years to capture lour consecutive
California large-school titles. Fa
ther and son were together for
three of the lour championships
Kicardo left to become head
coach .it Long Heat h State in
1998.
M\ tlad's been my coach for
ever." A/evedo said. "He never
pushed me; we've always had a
great relationship. I just got to
love the sport bv watching him."
A/evedo was a four-time sec
tional MVP .it Wilson, and his
numbers there are unsurpassed.
I le stored 11 !'> goals in three Years
,ui(l added 100 goals hallway
through bis senior Year belore
lea\ing to join the national team.
It was good practice for where
I'm .it now." he said. "I had to stay
creative and think against the high
school guvs .uid work on my
strength against the bigger players
on i he national team."
During bis senior year of high
school, A/evedo decided to attend
Stanford altei he was finished
pla\ ing in Svtlney. Spending time
on classwork, hanging out with
friends and surfing in his time
a\va\ from the pool, A/evedo is al
readv 1< >ving life on campus.
"It's fantastic to be here, a real
l\ great experience. I'm among
plavcrsthat I respect," he said.
Azevedo based his decision to
attend Stanft»i cl on its status as one
of the top programs in the country
.mil on iis inspiiing coach. Detta
nianti's plans to retire in 2002
have been postponed at least until
A/evedo graduates.
Named the N( A A (loach ol the
Yeai five times, Dettamanti is one

of the most successful coaches in
the league, producing both NCAA
championship teams and ()lympit
athletes. During his 23-year
tenure, he has led the Cardinal to
seven NCAA titles and to a nation
al top-four finish on 19 occasions.
He will be the U.S. head coach at
the World University Games this
summer and has applied to be the
water polo coach lor the U.S. in
the Summer Games of 2004.
"I'm not leaving; there's too
much tt> look forward to in the
next few years," Dettamanti said.
Water polo is the oldest
()lympic team sport and A/evedo
is proving to be a team player.
While A/evedo has decided lo
redshirt his freshman season, he
is just as dedicated to practicing
as he is to playing. This decision
allows A/.evedo to adjust to school
and gives him a break after play
ing for two straight years on the
national team.
"We need him to stay fresh,"
Dettamanti said.
At O-foot-l and 193 lbs., Azeve
do isn't the biggest player in I lie
water, but he might be the
smartest. Even though he's just a
freshman, he's already leading by
example, winning over his older
teammates by helping out in the
water, practicing after hours, and
always having a positive attitude.
"Being an Olympian hasn't
gone to his head; he truly tares
about his teammates and the
sport," said Ben Quittner, Stan
lord's assistant coach and a former
member of the powerhouse I lun
garian national team.
Goalie Nick Ellis remarket!,
" Tony's style of play has been im
pressed upon .ill of us. I le has an
amazing vision of t lie pool. He's
the most complete player I've
ever seen."
Though Azevedo's decision
meant turning down a European
contract with endorsements that
would have exceeded $100,000,
his relaxed California attitude
shines through.
" The time will come for that,"
he said. "It's better to get a degree.
I will definitely play professionally.
I have so many good years ahead."

Named the N( A A (loach ol the
Yeai five times, Dettamanti is one

of the most successful coaches in
the league, producing both NCAA
championship teams and ()lympit
athletes. During his 23-year
tenure, he has led the Cardinal to
seven NCAA titles and to a nation
al top-four finish on 19 occasions.
He will be the U.S. head coach at

water polo coach lor the U.S. in
the Summer Games of 2004.
"I'm not leaving; there's too
much tt> look forward to in the
next few years," Dettamanti said.
Water polo is the oldest
()lympic team sport and A/evedo
is proving to be a team player.
While A/evedo has decided lo
redshirt his freshman season, he
is just as dedicated to practicing
as he is to playing. This decision
allows A/.evedo to adjust to school
and gives him a break after play
ing for two straight years on the
national team.
"We need him to stay fresh,"
Dettamanti said.
At O-foot-l and 193 lbs., Azeve
do isn't the biggest player in I lie
water, but he might be the
smartest. Even though he's just a
freshman, he's already leading by
example, winning over his older
teammates by helping out in the
water, practicing after hours, and
always having a positive attitude.
"Being an Olympian hasn't
gone to his head; he truly tares
about his teammates and the
sport," said Ben Quittner, Stan
lord's assistant coach and a former
member of the powerhouse I lun
garian national team.
Goalie Nick Ellis remarket!,
" Tony's style of play has been im
pressed upon .ill of us. I le has an
amazing vision of t lie pool. He's
the most complete player I've
ever seen."
Though Azevedo's decision
meant turning down a European
contract with endorsements that
would have exceeded $100,000,
his relaxed California attitude
shines through.
" The time will come for that,"
he said. "It's better to get a degree.
I will definitely play professionally.
I have so many good years ahead."
