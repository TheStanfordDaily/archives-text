# Card runners end careers with style
## 
### BEN ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
I here are lew places where
running's purity of competition
is more breaihtakingly evident
than the Crystal Springs cross
country course, lis distances are
not measured along golf fairways
oi loops in a county park. At 4.19
rolling miles, the trails carved out
of the hills above Belmont just
may be a harrier's heaven.
"Crystal Springs is a cross
country runner's dream course,"
said junior Nathan Stoll. "It's a
wild course with lots of chal
lenges. Ifs relatively famous, so
p.n' of the fun is putting yourself
up against the times set by the
legends who have run here."
Those legends include Marty
Liquori, Frank Shorter and Stan
ford alumnus Don kardong.
The team that Stanford sent to
ilns weekend's Crystal Springs
Challenge was not the full steam
rolling crew that has successfully
romped around the country this
year but a smaller band of Cardi
nal racers looking to squeeze in a
bit of serious competition on a
Saturday morning.
The Stanford squad decided
to stick with its proven pack men
tality, and after the starter's gun
sounded, a conservative first mile
kept the group together. Stoll
took up the lead for the Cardinal

vviih senior lor Sandven and
redshirt freshmen Josh Sohn and
David Stillman just behind.
'ft was important for us to run
as a pack," Sandven said. "Even
though we split up a little, we
stayed in visual contact. We've
been training together, so I knew
we could stick together in a race."
During the second mile, the
pack broke and Stoll was off chas
ing the leaders, though Sohn,
Sandven and seniors Ryan Car
roll and Ross Venook were still in
the hunt.
"My plan was to go out conser
vatively, which is more my racing
style, and then work my way up
in the next couple of miles," Stoll
said. "(Stanford alumnus) Chris
Lundstrom moved in the second
mile, and I was caught a little off
guard," he said. "At that point,
my main goal was to put myself as
far ahead of the field as I could."
Stoll hammered out the final
miles, cruising home in fourth
place in 21 minutes, 10 seconds.
Behind him, Sohn and Sandven
were top-25 finishers in 21:57
and 21:58, respectively. Stillman
was 26th (22:05) and Venook was
30th.
Sohn's race was impressive, es
pecially considering the true
freshman year he spent nursing
injuries. Sandven also had an im

marked the end of the trail for

— the Challenge will likely be
their last run as Cardinal harri
ers. They will graduate in the
spring.

was our last cross country race for
