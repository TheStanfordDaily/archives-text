# On and off the ice, hockey struggles to stay on its skates
## 
### MALCOLM LEVINE 
Yes, it's true. Contrary to popular be
lief, there are sports played in California
that could not take place on the beach,
and ice hockey is one ol them.
Although the majority ol Stanford stu
dents may not know it, the men's ice
hockey team does exist, and is a perenni
al contender in the Pacific Eight Confer

ence — Oregon State University and
I niversity of Ai i/.ona do not field hockey
teams — despite its 0-3 (0-4 Pac 8) start.
I lie Cardinal is coming off last year's
third place finish in the conference tour
nament behind powerhouses DSC and
UCLA.
A strong nu< lens returns this year, led
by co-captains and four-year starters I).P.
Buck and (iieg Barker as well as All-Con

fereiu e sophomore forward Bobb> |aros.
Bui the team, beset In injuries and play
ing fora new coach, has gotten off to a
rough start in what looks to be a rebuild
ing year for the Cardinal.
In the season's first game against San
Jose State, Paul Bastian, a sophomore
who is the team's top left wing, went
down for the season with a broken wrist.
Two more returning forwards —

graduate student Alfred Murata and
sophomore kini Miller— are still recov
ering from off-season injuries and have
yet to suit up. The Cardinal awaits their
return, hoping that it will boost their ane
mic offensive output.
I his season is Mark Karma's first as
head coach, replacing D.J. Nadler, who
coached the previous two seasons.
Karma, a former assistant, has been wel

comed by the team, whose spirits and ex
pectations remain high.
"A conference championship is still a
plausible goal," Buck said. "The team re
mains optimistic fora berth in the confer
ence tournament."
I here have been some bright spots so
far, mainly the arrival of freshman for-
ward Taku Ide and freshman de
fenseman khaled Hassan, who
leads the team with IS penalty
minutes, a coveted statistic in
hockey.
The Cardinal team consistent
ly has problems that other
schools in the Pac-8 don't have
due to the dearth of hockey play
ers on campus.
Some schools actually have

enough players to form Varsity
and |V squads, such as USC,
Oregon, and Washington.
Kvery year, the Cardinal faces
an arduous task in putting to
gether a full hockey team with
enough experienced players to
take the ice.
However, the small pool of
Stanford hockey players dictates
that the team must have a wel
coming policy to all students.
"Anyone with any kind of skill
finds themselves on the team and
playing in games," Buck s.iid.
Since ice hockey is a dub sport,

the team must <ilso deal with pay
ing for increasingly expensive
rink time — now up to $200 per
hour — through dub dues and
lundraising efforts.
Said Sherry Posthumus, Stan
ford's director of club sports,
"Playing club sports really makes
one appreciate what it takes to be
an athlete, train hard, and be the
best one can be."
Needless to say, this rings true
for the members of the ice hockey
team, who will try to start their
season anew Friday night against
local rival Palmer College.
