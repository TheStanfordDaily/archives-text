# Islamic Society continues to grow and strengthen
## 
### MAX EDLESON 
Walking through White Plaza early on a Friday
afternoon, one is likelv to hear Hossam Fahmy's
Arabic verses ringing through the air from the Old
Union Courtyard. Ihe age-old call that Fahmy, a
doctoral student in electrical engineering, invokes is
a Variation of one that many Muslims know by
heart.
Fahmy invites fellow believers to join the tradi
tional Friday congregational prayer. People trickle
in, removing their shoes, to join other observers on
the mats that cover this shaded corner of the court
yard.
By the filial prayer, there are upward of 1 10 peo
ple who have come, all facing the direction of
Mecca. 1 his large group's synchronized move
ments and c horus of Islamic prayers are a striking
reminder that amid the secular culture of Stanford
and the tension in the Middle Fast. Islam plays an
important spiritual role in the lives of many stu
dents and community members.
This weekly Friday prayer is organized by the Is
lamic Society of Stanford University, the umbrella
group coordinating Islamic life on campus. Al
though the society is now a well-established organi
zation on campus, with a prayer room in the Old
I nion (Clubhouse with other campus ministries and
a large community base, its presence has not always
been so strong.
Islamic Society comes to Stanford
When Mai glioub Quraishi arrived at Stanford in
1958 for his graduate studies, there was neither a
student organization on campus that catered to the
needs of Mus im students nor a viable location to
perforin the live daily prayers that are an integral
part of the Islamic faith.
Determined to improve the situation for Mus
lims on campus, Quraishi formed the Stanford Is
lamic Society, which was later renamed as the Is
lamic Society of Stanford University. I he original
group ol 12 students arranged fora location on
campus tl) perform their daily prayers, held con
gregational prayers on Fridays and organized edu
cational events.
About 250 undergraduate and graduate stu
dents comprise the Islamic Society. Unlike many
student groups, however, the society enjoys a large
following of alumni who continue to attend events
regularly.
"['l he society] fulfills a basic need for people in
the Peninsula area," said Inn an Maskatia '98, a past
president of the society. "A lot of people keep com-
ing back because they like the ac
tivities, the approach and find this
a unique community to belong
to."
Changing of the guard
While members hail from all
corners of the globe, span every
major ethnic group and speak a
proliferation of languages, the
most significant change in mem
bership the group has gone
through lias been the increased
presence of American Muslims.
In the past, the group consist
ed mostlv of international gradu

ate students, but now, the club is
dominated by U.S. citizens, many
of whom are second or third gen
eration Americans.
The addition of American
Muslims to the group since the
1980s had a big impact on the so
ciety, Kahmy said.
Prior to the surge of Americans
in the society, lie said, the society
had international students who
were not so active in other organi
zations on campus.
"But once we had more Amer
icans coming into the society, you
see more activism, more work to
wards getting involved with other
groups, awareness projects, initia
tives like the prison outreach pro
gram," Fahmy said. "American
people are more aware of Ameri

can society's challenges and of
local issues."
Serving the community
The group is currently in
volved in prison outreach, a tutor
ing program run in conjunction
with a mosque in East Palo Alto
and eflbrts to inform and promote
awareness about Islam in the
greater community, members
said.
The Muslim Students Aware
ness Network, a group affiliated
with the society, lias a stronger
political bent and focuses organiz
ing lectures and seminars. The
network also aims to increase
awareness of Islamic culture and
list often limited and negative
portrayal l>v the American media.

" There's more outrage about
things |people| sa\ that are wrong
because Americans in tlie group
are more aware and more direct!)
involved with local issues," said ju
nior Ereti lasar.
One of the group's long-term
goals is the creation of an Islamic
Studies Program as part of I ni
versity's curriculum. To that end,
Visiting Prof. Ibrahim Moosa was
invited to teach two courses on
Islam during fall quarter ol Ht'.)?.
Moosa is now a visiting professor
in the Religious Studies Depart
ment as well as associate clean for
religious life.
Coming together
In addition to its regular
events, the society oilers support

during Ramadan, the hoi) month
in which Muslims last from sun
rise to sunset. Members are also
planning for the Islam Awareness
Week in April, which will feature
speakers, workshops, culinan
and educational events.
I he group hopes to implement
an honorary loan system lor the
Muslim community, laniln de
scribes it as a service that provides
scholarships, fellowships and loans
without interest with the hopes ol
strengthening the conimunit) and
its presence on c ampus.
The Islamic Society at Stanlord
provides not only a religious set
ting but also .1 comfortable and
energized social environment for
its members, members sa\.
