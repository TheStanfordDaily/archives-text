# Top forward commits to Stanford, completes vaunted recruiting class
## 
### JONATHAN STULL EDITORIAL STAFF 
Fora while, Stanford was considered a flash
in the college basketball pan. But with contin
ued success on the floor — and impressive vic
tories in the cutthroat world of recruiting—the
Cardinal lias entered the rarefied world of the
basketball elite.
This past weekend, that prominence was
confirmed as Stanford received a verbal com
mitment from its third to]) recruit this fall.
Josh Childress, a 6-lbot-6 small forward
from Mayfair 11igh School in Lakewood, Calif.,
t ailed both Kansas head coach Roy Williams —
who had already offered Childress a scholar
ship — and Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery this weekend to tell them that he was
coining to the Farm next fall.
1 le is expected to sign a formal letter of in

tent on Nov. 8, the first day recruits can official
ly commit to schools.
The commitment by Childress, named the
nation's No. 3 small forward by recruiting ex
pert Dave Telep and the top player at his posi
tion by West Coast guru Tracy Pierson, gives
Stanford one of the best classes in school histo
ry. With the pending graduation of starters Jar
ron Collins, Mike McDonald and Ryan
Mendez, it couldn't come at a better time.
Chris Hernandez, a (>-1 point guard from
Clovis West in Fresno, Calif, committed to
Stanford in June and will look to fill M< Don
ald's spot on the squad.
While Hernandez has not been highly re
garded nationally, regional experts like Pierson
who have seen Hernandez play rank him at the
top of his class. In June, Pierson tabbed him the
top-ranked point guard on the West Coast.
Robert Little, a 6-9, 265 lb. inside bruiser,

committed to the Cardinal Oct. 4 after a suc
cessful visit to campus. While Little averaged
only 15 points per game during his junior sea
son, his stock shot up alter an impressive show
ing at numerous summer camps.
By September, relep ranked Little the No. 8
center in the nation and schools such as Duke,
Kentucky and Michigan were looking to land
the player from Pope Paul VI in Fairfax, Va.
Though the NCAA does not allow schools to
publicly comment on recruits until they have
officially signed, it is easy to see why Mont
gomery wanted to land Childress.
After a sophomore year in which he aver
aged over 21 points per game, Childress was
named the California Player of the Year, fea
turing a deadly mixture of mid-range jumpers
and slashing drives, Childress followed that
performance with another All-state selection
following Ins junior season.
