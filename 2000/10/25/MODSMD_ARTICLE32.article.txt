# Divine science: the evidence of a creator
## 
### JOSHUA BENSON 
Science lias traditionally cast a wary eye
towards questions of God. lint today, a
growing number of scientists are rethink
ing sucli doctrine, challenging the absence
of Clod from scientific discourse, and em
bracing a new explanation for how and
whv humaniiN evolved. Proponents of'this
"rational design explanation" believe sci
entific evidence strough suggests the pres
ence of an intelligent c reator.
Lecturing at Stanford last week. Prof.
Walter Bradley,ol lexasA&M,offered his
thoughts on the theory. As a professor <>l
mechanical engineering, Dr. Bradley
brings a trained eye to the debate over
God. In his estimation, pure randomness
cannot account for the way nature is "line
tuned" to our needs. Instead, such preci
sion implies the handiwork of a designer.
As Bradley admits, proponents of the
rational design theory inherit a heavy
mantra of scientific skeptic ism. Scientists
of the early 20th centun. keenh aware of
the historical animosity between science
and religion, avoided disc ussions of God,
worried that religious sentiment chal
lenged their work. I he experience of
John Scopes, the school teacher who was
put in a criminal court in 1925 lor teach
ing Darwinian evolution, coin inced mam
scientists that relerenc e to C lod in a cultur
al context threatened the legitimacy ol sci
entific pursuit.
I his perceived threat, combined with

ilie tremendous advances ol biology
under Darwin and physics under Einstein,
led mam scientists to assume that "science
would soot) explain everything, that God
was not needed in the natural world." ac
cording to Bradley. And yet, in the years
since, science has certainly not explained
everything, while the tension between
God and science lias remained. Bradley
hopes to reconcile this divide. Inclined to
wards spec ifics, he oilers a bountv of hard
evidence to support his position.
According to Bradley, the universe ful
fills more than "thirty-live requirements

for the formation of 'life; requirements that
seem more designed than accidental."
These requirements include a mathemati
cal universe of regularity, pattern and pre
dictability; elemental and molecular diver
sity found in the periodic table; a long
term energy source, such as the sun; and
the basic laws of physics, which allow mat
ter and energy to interact on increasingly
complex levels. Vary one of these funda
mental laws or constants and the universe
changes dramatically.
For example, the strong nuclear force,
which holds atoms together, and the elec

tromagnetic force, so integral to our mod
ern world, share a line balance. Alter ilie*
magnitude of either lbrce just a bit, and
"everything falls apart. Stars would have
no long-term stability, and lew elements
would exist bevond hydrogen. Life in any
form would be impossible." And yet, the
relationship between the forces could, the
oretically, be anything. "There is no spe
cial need lor the two forces to so finely bal
ance," Bradley says. Such precision sug
gests design rather than chaos.
( loser to home, Bradley finds evidence
fora creative designer in the "truly re

markahlc nature oi Karili." Bradley oilers
a litany of "just-so" conditions and coinci
dences about our planet that seem beyond
the realm of sheet chance. (>i 11 moon, lor
instance, the product ol a freak collision
between the Karth and a large asteroid,
(unctions to keep the planet's poles more
or less steady in their alignment to the
plane ol the solar system. "II we did not
have so large a moon, our temperature
would fluctuate wildly between inhos
pitable extremes. Instead, because of a
'random' occurrence, we have a temper
ate climate." Furthermore, Karth has just
the right amounts of water, sunlight, oxy
gen, carbon, etc.
Professor of Comparative Language
Richard Rorty, one <>l the most distin
guished American philosophers living
today, doesn't buy the rational design ar
gument either. In the first place, Rorty
questions the scientific validity of the theo
ry. "No scientific criterion has been settled
With this evidence. Science is about mech
anism, about how the trick is done. This
[theory] does not explain anything; it oi
lers no mechanism."
In his lecture, however, Bradley em
phasized that his examples were but a tiny
fraction of the mounting evidenc e point
ing towards a planned universe. Still, he
acknowledged that one cannot prove or
disprove the existence of God. Instead,
Bradley asks people to consider "what is

the most likely explanation lor
these findings." In his estimation,
pure randomness is an improba
ble explanation lor such order;
evidence favors the presence of a
designer. " I liink ol it this way,
Bradley suggests," If vou roll dou
ble sixes once, is that very improb
able? No. 1 low about live times in
a row? I nlikely. but possible.
Now what it vou throw the dice
and get double sixes 1 billion
times in a row. Is that pure
chance, or is something else going
on?"
A number ol students at the
lecture remained unconvinced.
Trevor ( lane, a sophomore elec -
trical engineering major, ques
tioned the basic tenets of the theo
ry. "I just heard a lot ol facts
tonight. Bui il the universe wasn't
situated just perfectly, we
wouldn't be here to ask these
questions. And our mere pres
ence does not necessarily suggest
a (iod.
()thers felt il presumptuous to
plac eso much failh in the absolute
accuracy ol modern science.
Rortv believes il is a fallacy to
assign such human terms as "de
signer" to a supposedly all-power
lul being. " I lie minute you define
(iod with language, you limit
11iiii. ... I le becomes unavailable
to science as ,111 explanation."
Finall \. Rorty asks what
progress lias been made even il
we ac c ept the presence ol an intel
ligent creator. "()K, so there is a
designer. What else can you tell
me? 'Designer' is .1 long was from
'(iod.
In deciding what to believe,
few people rel\ on elaborate
proofs or convoluted arguments.
For most, I lie question of (iod
conies clown to instinct, to what
makes sense. I o Bradley, the uni
verse appears designed rather
than accidental, precise rather
than random. Bradle\ believes
that the power of science has "low
ered the barrier 10 belief."
