HIV-positive and AIDS patients: Stanford
researchers have found a definitive link be
tween levels of glutathione, an anti-oxidant
essential for proper upkeep of the immune
system, and progression towards illness.
Restoring glutathione to normal,
healthy levels, the researchers said, may
help 111 V-infected patients light the viruses
ill.it cause AIl)S and other diseases.
"NAC will increase glutothione levels,"
said Leonore Her/enberg, professor of-ge
netics. "Many of the diseases people have
can be related t<> low levels of glutothione.
"[There is] an association between
raising glutothione levels and survival
[for lIIV positive patients]," she said.
"More trial work needs to be done, of
c ourse, but for now we believe it's a good
idea to increase glutothione levels for
these patients."
Her/enberg, with husband Prof.
Leonard Her/enberg and the late Greg
Dubs,l'll.o., largely designed and con
ducted the clinical trial. Thirty-one HlV
infected patients were given daily doses ol
N-acetylcysteine, or NAC, a substance that
turns into glutathione in the body. Thirty
others were given a benign sugar pill.
At the start of the trial, all patients were
glutathione-defic ient. Some had less than
half the amount found in healthy people.
But, by the end of the two-month trial,
those taking NAC had increased the
amount ol glutathione in their bodies to
near-normal levels.
"What we've proven is that giving people
NAC replenishes the glutathione stores,"
said Leonore Her/enberg.
Tor years, scientists have known that
cells infected with HIV are glutathione-de
ficient but never understood the relation
ship between glutathione deficiency and
the onset of opportunistic infections such as
AIDS.
The Stanford study is significant because
it establishes a correlation between glu
tathione deficiency and a disease's progres
sion â€” a correlation so solid the re
searchers propose glutathione levels as a
strong indicator of how cjnickly an HIV

positive patient's symptoms deteriorate
into AIDS.
The results of the Herzenbergs'
study were published in the Oct. I issue
of the "European |ournal of Clinical
I nvestigal ion."
"I am really excited," said Leonore
Her/enberg. "Looking at the scientific evi
dence for what [NA( .| does and the scientific
evidence for how AIDS works, our guess is
that treatment with | NA( '.| may be quite good.
"But until we get it tested in patients, we
won't know if it will work," she added.
Preliminary results show patients suf
fered no ill effects from t.iking NAC. At the
end of the eight-week trial, most patients
chose to take NAC for six more months. Re
searchers continued monitoring the sup
plement's safety.
NAC is produced in living organ
isms from the amino acid cysteine. It is
a natural sulfur containing an amino
acid derivative found naturally in
foods and functions as a powerful an
tioxidant in the body. Glutathione, in
contrast to NAC, must cross cell walls
to serve many of the body's needs.
The HIV virus, however, decreases the
transport of glutathione into cells and, as a
result, the immune system fails. NAC, on
the other hand, is well absorbed and readi
ly passes through cellular membranes in

AI l)S patients.
According to Leonard Her/enberg, glu
tathione does not directly decrease the
ainonnt of virus in a patient's blood or in
crease his number of virus-lighting I cells,
but does restore the immune system.
" I lie level of glutathione is tiglitlv regu
lated in cells," he said. "IT nature has gone
to the trouble of maintaining those levels,
logic says it should be restored to that level
if you can.
"It's like <t vitamin deficiency," Leonard
Herzcnberg added. Any vitamin deficiency
would immediately be corrected, and we
believe that this is equivalent to a vitamin
deficiency."
According to the Leonore Her/enberg,
mcdicinal-quality NAC is available to eligi
ble patients in Europe but only as an un
regulated food supplement.
Leonore 1 ler/.enberg expressed concern
over the lack of regulation. "You have no
control over [verifying] what's on the label
is really in [the bottle]," she said.
"A certain impurity (ailed dinac turns
out to be highly active in ways that are coun
terproductive lor HIV patients," Her/en
berg said. "With PharmaNAC, we were able
to get a good preparation, with less than 10
percent impurities.
"We've spent years looking for someone
who would do this."
