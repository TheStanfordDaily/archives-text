Whitfield never intended to
inter the biotech industry, but
the management and strategic
organization principles he
learned at Stanford and
Boston Consulting Croup
made him it valuable asset in
am business.

Applications ol genomics and
biotechnology have gained
prominence through issues mm !i
as genetically modified foods
and cloning. I here are many
moral and ethical concerns that
face us today and in the future
regarding further research in
these areas.
"Human cloning clearly
should be against the law,
Whitfield said. "Still, 1 don't
think we can automatically as
sume that all applications ol
biotechnologv are bad. We need
to have some long debates on
the issue belore we come to an\
conclusions.
