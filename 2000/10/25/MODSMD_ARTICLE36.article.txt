# Will sales taxes catch up to e-commerce?
## 
### JEFF WU 
It's being buried in die current presi
dential campaign, but there's .1 potential
ly explosive mix ol tech and lax simmer
ing behind the scenes.
Alter the elet lion, it will become a po
litical hot potato again, pining shopping
centers and state governments against e
conmicrce linns and anii-lax advocates.
Hie issue is a complicated combination of
federalism, e-conmierce and, of course,
taxes. I he next step in the question of
taxes on the intei net, however, seems all
too dear.
The problem
1 oday. il you buy a compact disc from
the Stanford bookstore, vou pav sales tax,
but if you buy the same c ompad disc from
Amazon, you don't. More complicated, il
you buy that compact disc from a Barnes
& Noble store, you pay the tax. but il you
buy it from barnesandnoble.com (which
is only partially owned by Barnes &
Noble), you don't. If vou're wondering
what would happen if you bu\ that com
pact disc from a barnesandnoble.com In
ternet kiosk in the Barnes & Noble store,
you're getting a sense ol how complicated
this all might get.
Ol course, retailers complain that it's
unfair thai iheir customers should have to
pay 8.25 percent more than consumers
who shop online —especially since retail is
such a low-margin business. Stales and
munic ipalities, manv ol which also assess
sales taxes, wort) that as e-conmierce
gr<>ws, a larger pc>rii< >11 < »l the ecoik>my will
remain untaxed. A University - of Ten
nessee st 1 icl\ estimated that % 10.8 billion of
taxes could be lost to the Internet 111 2003.
()n the other hand, e-conmierce com
panies complain that it isn't lair to 111.ike
them keep track of the lax regimes of the
7,500 separate tax jurisdictions in ibis
country and send 111 tax payments to all of
them. Internet enthusiasts worn that anv
taxation or government regulation will
kill (oral least maim) a nascent indusirv.

And anti-tax advocates just want to keep
the mone\ out ol the government's hands.
A little history
Currently, 45 states rely on sales taxes
lor a significant part of their general rev
enues — some, almost exclusively. Be-

cause of a 1002 Supreme (ouri decision,
Quill vs. North Dakota (which up-

held a previous, similar, deci
sion), the states are not permit
ted to lore c companies without
a sufficient "nexus" to collect

sales taxes. Basically, the rea
soning was that since the
Constitution gave the fed-

eral government the
right to regulate inter-

state commerce, allow
ing stales to lorce out
of-state companies to

collect sales taxes would
infringe upon an exclu
sive federal power.

I lie term "nexus" lias
generally been inter
preted to mean that if
you have a physical
presence in a state, such

.is a brick-and-mortar
store or warehouse, it's
okav lor that state to force
vou to collect sales taxes.
Note, however, that this

doesn't mean it's illegal lor
states to force out-of-state
companies to collect sales
taxes; it's just illegal lor them
to do so without Congression
al approval.
As a result, catalog compa-

nil's such as L.L. Bean have been able to
avoid levying sales taxes to consumers in
most states. Residents of Maine and New
Hampshire, where 1..L. Bean has stores,
are subject to sales lax.
In response, most states have levied so
called "use taxes" — taxes on the use of
items purchased from out-of-state com
panies. But since states can't force the

companies to levy the tax. it's pretty much
up to the consumer to pay up. Not sur
prisingly, few people do. Last year, lewer
than 1,600 Florida taxpayers paid the use
tax — the joke being that most of those
taxpayers probably worked lor the Flori
da Department of Revenue, since they

we r e
the only ones who knew about it.
Current legislation
In May, the U.S. I louseol Representa
tives voted to extend the so-tailed Inter
net tax moratorium which bans access
taxes to the Internet and am taxes spe

cially targeting the Internet or e-cotn
tnerce — until 2006. I nexpectedlv, a
loose coalition of brick-and-mortar shop
ping centers, real estate developers, slate
governments and non-profiis dependent
on state funding came together and
stalled the bill in the Senate. No action is
expec ted 11111 il the next legislative session.
California Governor Grey Davis re
cently vetoed a bill forcing retailers

with a physic al presence 111
the state to collect sales
taxes on their e-commerc e
transactions.

With this veto, Davis cited
the need to study the issue
further, though the po
litical firepower of Sili
con Valley probably
had something to do
with it.

I here are a few
proposals to c reate
a system that
would allow sales
taxes on the Inter
net. Most of them
try to solve the
7,500-tax-jurisdic-

tion problem by re
lying 011 certified
third parties (banks,
accounting firms,

software compa
nies) to write code
that would allow re
tailers to input the lo-

cation of the customer
and have the appropri
ate tax levied and sent to
the appropriate jnrisclic -

tions. Notably, Intel's Andv
(irove recently testified to Con
gress tli.u these logistical problems were
"not insurmountable.' In fad, a simple
version of such a system is alreadv in place
in Washington state.
I hese proposals are usually also con
tingent upon ;i critical mass of the stales
getting together to simplil\ their oul-ol-

Male lax systems in order i<> make a na
tion. il svsiem more manageable. Anii-ia\
advocates scoll that the slates have been
trying to simplily the code unsuc< esslully
lor decades.
The only solution
1 lie Internet is beginning to mature
into a "real industnlt's beginning to ac
tivelv lobby lor its issues in Washington,
1).(I his elet tion (vt le, the tech and In
ternet industries gave S'J I million to the
presidential candidates — the eighth most
generous industry, last election <\<le,
tliev were 33rd, gi\ing onl\ million.
It's probably about time thai ihe Inter
net companies helped to pay lot our
toads and schools. II the tech industn
wants to spend big money on goyem
inent lobbying, as it should, then it would
behoove it to spend ibis money on issues
that grow the nation's pie (like immigrant
visas, and education), instead of eating
those pieces that belong to bricks-and
mot tar retail.
K-commerce is young, but it is certain
ly not in danger ol being 'studied out' by
sales taxes. The 7,">()()-tax-jui isdii lion
problem will only be a problem until the
entrepreneur and venture capital com
munity decide that it's a big enough op
portunity to invest in. In lad, certain
early tec hnologies are already available to
solve this problem. And .is ioi tax simpli
fication, some two dozen stales are ( in
tently working on a simplified national
scheme.
Though anti-tax advocates and leder
alists are decrying the potential birth ola
national sales i«i\, I feel thai it would be a
positive step. A decade ago, (ianada went
through a painful debate about .1 nation
al goods-and-services tax, and eventually
caved in to the realities ol the modern
economy, implementing a national tax.
It's probably about time the I nilcd States
did the same, and il the cvberi/ation ol
the economy is the impetus, that s all 1 he
betler.
