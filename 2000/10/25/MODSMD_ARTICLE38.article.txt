NEW YORK (AP) â€” Although
blacks si ill lag in access to the In
ternet, a new study finds that those
who are connected are more likely
than whites to appreciate iis value
as an information tool.
Forty-five percent ol black
Americans with online access
iound the Internet useful lor get
ting health t are information, com
pared with .15 percent ol white Net
users, the Pew Internet & Ameri
can Life Project lound in its latest
study.
l he report, released Sunday,
also lound blacks were more likely
than whites to use the Internet to
lincl information on religion, jobs
and housing.
"I'm really struck by the de
gree to which African-American
Internet users have looked to the
Internet lor economic advance
ment and lifestyle improve
ment," said Lee Rainie, the
study s director.
lilac ks are also more likely to
sa\ the Internet helps them pur
sue hobbies, the siuch lound. On
the other hand, whites have a
greater tendenc \ to find the Inter
net useful lor connecting with fam
ilies .md friends.
Darien Dash, who runs .1 pro
gram to e(|iii|) minorities with low
cost computers and free Internet
access, said blacks are more likeh
to appreciate the Internet's value
bc( .iiise the\ have more limited ac
cess to similar resources ollline.
for example, he said, many
111 ban hlac ks can't get good health
care information, and their
schools do not oiler as many en
richment programs as those in
richer areas.
fhe Pew survey was based on
random telephone interviews with
12,751 adults from March I to
Aug. 20.
()l that group, 1,501 are black,
.md of them use the Internet.
I lie findings about blacks online
have a margin of error of plus or

minus ;> percent.
Last Monday, ilie Commerce
Department issued a report show
ing that while more black house
holds now have Internet access,
they are si ill less likely than white
households to be connected.
More than 2,'i percent of black
households had access in August
2000, up from 1 1 percent in De
cember 1998. But the access gap
continued to widen, with whites
getting connected at a faster clip.
Some 10 percent of white house
holds had access in August, up
liom 30 percent in 1998.
Pew reached similar conclu
sions about increases in blacks con
nected to the Internet. Almost half
of all blacks online- more than 3.5
million - logged on for the first
time in the past year.
Among other findings:
- Black women make up 50 per
cent of the black online popula
tion. while white users are even
ly split between men and
women.
-As a group, the black online pop
ulation has less income and less ed
ucation than whites with Internet
access.
-A little more than a third ol blacks
with access go online on a typical
dav, compared with some 56 per
cent for whites. But those numbers
may reflect experience: A greater
share of blacks online are newcom
ers, and past studies have found
that newcomers in general tend to
use the Internet less frequently.
