I axes are an important issue in ever) national elec

this year. Thanks to projected surpluses of'more than $4
trillion over the next 10 years, the federal government
has lound itself in a position of budgetar) flexibility.

party candidates for president, Republican candidate

(»ov. (leorge \V. Hush of Texas ancl Democratic candi

candidates, Ralph Nader and l'at Buchanan, have ol

tention to debt reduction. 1 le plans
on spending one-lc un til of (lie pro
jected surplus lor «lie next 10 years
($•!.() trillion) on tax nils.
He supports a< ross-tlie-board
c uts on the federal income tax. Peo
ple in the top income bracket will see
their tax rate go from So.f> lo.'W per
cent, while people in the middle and
bottom brackets will see their tax
rate go from both 28 and .SI percent
to 25 percent, and l;~ito 10 percent.
For (') million additional work
ing-class Americans, the federal in
come tax will disappear altogether.
Bush is also ollering child tax
credits, educational tax deductions
(including school vouc hers) and.in
end to the so-called "death tax,'
which levies a one-time tax on the
estates of the deceased.
I lalfof the remainder of the sur
plus will go toward helping Social
Security In c reating personal retire
ment accounts for people and re
ducing the $:U-trillion national
debt that still remains.
Martin .Andersc >n, a senior lellow
at the Hoover Institution, said he
sees this as a good plan. I le believes
that the tax cuts are necessary to
"keep economic growth going and
not slide into recession."
"Every single person who is
working gets a tax cut [under the
plan]," he said.
Christopher Desmond, a junior
and a president emeritus ol the
Stanford Republicans, said that
though mail) have criticized Bush
as cutting taxes onl\ lor the rich,
"under Governor Bush's plan,
wealthy households (defined as
those households earning $200,000
or more) would pay exactly the
same 27.4 pet c ent of all federal in
come taxes that they do now."
krista Glaser, a senior and chair
of Stanford Democrats, disagrees
with Bush's stance. She believes that
"tax relief should go to the people
who really deserve it, and the top
one percent really don't need it."
She also believes that the Bush

plan will result in a return to the- big
budget deficits of the 1980s.
"Reagononiics have failed,"
('.laser said. "It led lo huge deficits as
a result. I just don't think vou can
cut taxes In a huge amount and re
duce debt. Clinton's policies have
w< irked."
Gore's plan of action
A centerpiece ol (lore's econom
ic platform is debt reduction. He
wants to use $2.3 trillion ol the So
cial Securitv surplus to completely
pay oil t he debt by 2012. By doing
so. the federal government will no
longer have to pay interest on the
debt, therefore freeing tax re
sources lor I letter use.
Gore supports tax abatement
lor working-class families and the
middle class through lax credits.
I le advocates < hild credits and tax
relief lor siay-at-home parents as
well as an exemption from the
"death tax" lor small businesses
and small farms.
I le wants to expand the Earned
Income I ax ('.redit.a tax relief mea
sure that was created to help work
ing families during the Clinton
(lore administration. I Inder Ins ex
panded plan, f>.B-million additional
families with three or more children
will be able to receive the c redit.
Finally, Gore is ollering long
term preigrams to be ilster the ec c mc >-
my, such as lax incentives lor small
businesses, tax-free savings ac
counts to bolster American saving
rates, school lax credits, technology
bonds and tax incentives for busi
nesses to become more environ
mentally safe.
Luis Fraga, a political science
professor, said he sees (lore s pro
gram .is more equitable than
Bush's,
"There is nothing as unequal .is
the equal treatment ol uncquals."
Fraga said in reference to the Bush
plan.
(llascr agreed.
" Flie Democratic Party believes
there are limited resources, she
said. "We have to pick and choose
who is going to be receiv ing target
ed tax relief and who doesn't; we
give tax relief to iliose who realh
need it.and the wealthv are doing

quite well because of Glinton-( lc >re."
Anderson said he sees many
problems wilh (lore's plan, howev
er. He believes lhat Gore s plan to
pay down the debt partially using
I he Social Security surplus is a dan
gerous position to take.
()u taxes, Anderson pointed out
that while it is very easy lor every
American citi/en to calculate exact
ly how big of a tax cut one would
git under Bush's budget, (lore's
plan is mm h less unified and more
convoluted.
"(lore's plan, as he says, is 'tar
geted,' meaning that there are hun
dreds ol specific little cuts, exemp
tions and credits you can he eligible
lor," 1 )esmond added. "While these
may add up to more than Bush's
plan lor some families, they will cer
tainly add up to less lor others, in ad
dition to adding thousands of pages
to the tax code."
Buchanan: Let's shift the burden
Buchanan, the Reform Party
candidate, has a platform of no fed
eral taxation on the lirst $!15,00() of
salaried income. Beyond that, he is
pushing .1 Hat l< > pet cent tax for
everyone. He wants to abolish the
"death tax" for estates tip to $5 mil
lion, and create more child (redits to
promote str< >ng families.
fo accomplish this and pay
down ihe debt. But Italian proposes
to shift the tax burden from small
businesses to multinational corpo
rations and foreign imports as well
as lew import lat ills on other na
tions. I le plans to return all non-so
cial securitv surplus money back to
the people.
Nader's fight
While at Stanford on Monday
night fora speech at Memorial
Auditorium, Nader, the Green
Part\ s candidate lor president,
discussed his tax policies.
"Personal tax cuts will not build
the needed public transit systems,
communis health clinics, repair
the s( hools." Nader said, t elerring
to Bush's tax plan. "What we need
is progressive taxation enforced
against corporations where loop-
In )les and tax shelters are draining
tens of billions of dollars away

from the people's treasury.
They're not paying their fair
share."
Nader also wants to generate
additional revenue by using taxes
to achieve policy goals.
"We need to start to tax things
we don't like, like pollution, like
speculation in the stock market,"
he said.
Together with the budget sur
plus, Nader would use this money
to abolish child poverty and re
build and repair public works,
water and transit systems and
schools.
Tarek Ghani, a sophomore and
financial manager lor the Stan
lord Green Party, believes that
Nader is a straight shooter.
"People are attracted to the
environmental plank of the
Green Party; Nader's integrity,
ability to stay on topic," he said.
"He believes in the concept that
corporations should not control
society, that money is not as im
portant to a person."
On the other hand, junior Jef
ferson Eppler, treasurer of the
Stanford Republicans, takes issue
with Nader's position on progres
sive taxation. He believes that
more progressive taxes would be
equivalent to giving direct pay
ments from the rich to the poor,
which in turn would "reduce the
incentive for the poor to work and
the rich to innovate."
The taxation issue has come up
many times during this presiden
tial campaign, though the stands
that Nader and Buchanan take
are less known due to their par
lies' less-prominent status in the
national limelight.
For many Stanford students,
the specter of working after grad
uation has already caused them to
pay attention to the tax issue.
Jessica Rahman, a sophomore,
believes that it is a significant issue
"because in lour years I'll be out of
college, so whoever gets elected
will affect me."
P. J. Balin, a junior, concurred.
"Graduating from Stanford, I
will probably be in a high tax
bracket, so I'll be paying lots of
taxes," she said.

Nader's fight
While at Stanford on Monday
night fora speech at Memorial
Auditorium, Nader, the Green
Part\ s candidate lor president,
discussed his tax policies.
"Personal tax cuts will not build
the needed public transit systems,
communis health clinics, repair
the s( hools." Nader said, t elerring
to Bush's tax plan. "What we need
is progressive taxation enforced
against corporations where loop-
In )les and tax shelters are draining
tens of billions of dollars away

from the people's treasury.
They're not paying their fair
share."
Nader also wants to generate
additional revenue by using taxes
to achieve policy goals.
"We need to start to tax things
we don't like, like pollution, like
speculation in the stock market,"
he said.
Together with the budget sur
plus, Nader would use this money
to abolish child poverty and re
build and repair public works,
water and transit systems and
schools.
Tarek Ghani, a sophomore and
financial manager lor the Stan
lord Green Party, believes that
Nader is a straight shooter.
"People are attracted to the
environmental plank of the
Green Party; Nader's integrity,
ability to stay on topic," he said.
"He believes in the concept that
corporations should not control
society, that money is not as im
portant to a person."
On the other hand, junior Jef
ferson Eppler, treasurer of the
Stanford Republicans, takes issue
with Nader's position on progres
sive taxation. He believes that
more progressive taxes would be
equivalent to giving direct pay
ments from the rich to the poor,
which in turn would "reduce the
incentive for the poor to work and
the rich to innovate."
The taxation issue has come up
many times during this presiden
tial campaign, though the stands
that Nader and Buchanan take
are less known due to their par
lies' less-prominent status in the
national limelight.
For many Stanford students,
the specter of working after grad
uation has already caused them to
pay attention to the tax issue.
Jessica Rahman, a sophomore,
believes that it is a significant issue
"because in lour years I'll be out of
college, so whoever gets elected
will affect me."
P. J. Balin, a junior, concurred.
"Graduating from Stanford, I
will probably be in a high tax
bracket, so I'll be paying lots of
taxes," she said.
I axes are an important issue in ever) national elec
tion, l)iit mam would say that they are especially crucial
this year. Thanks to projected surpluses of'more than $4
trillion over the next 10 years, the federal government
has lound itself in a position of budgetar) flexibility.
I herefbre it is not surprising that both of"the major
party candidates for president, Republican candidate

(»ov. (leorge \V. Hush of Texas ancl Democratic candi
date Vice President A1 Ciore, as well .is two third-part;
candidates, Ralph Nader and l'at Buchanan, have ol
tiered detailed and unique ideas on what to do with tlv
budget surplus and how it aflec is federal tax policies.

He supports a< ross-tlie-board

ple in the top income bracket will see
their tax rate go from So.f> lo.'W per
cent, while people in the middle and
bottom brackets will see their tax
rate go from both 28 and .SI percent
to 25 percent, and l;~ito 10 percent.
For (') million additional work

Bush is also ollering child tax

estates of the deceased.
I lalfof the remainder of the sur

Martin .Andersc >n, a senior lellow
at the Hoover Institution, said he
sees this as a good plan. I le believes
that the tax cuts are necessary to
"keep economic growth going and
not slide into recession."
"Every single person who is
working gets a tax cut [under the
plan]," he said.
Christopher Desmond, a junior
and a president emeritus ol the
Stanford Republicans, said that
though mail) have criticized Bush
as cutting taxes onl\ lor the rich,
"under Governor Bush's plan,
wealthy households (defined as
those households earning $200,000
or more) would pay exactly the
same 27.4 pet c ent of all federal in
come taxes that they do now."
krista Glaser, a senior and chair
of Stanford Democrats, disagrees
with Bush's stance. She believes that
"tax relief should go to the people
who really deserve it, and the top
one percent really don't need it."
She also believes that the Bush

plan will result in a return to the- big
budget deficits of the 1980s.
"Reagononiics have failed,"
('.laser said. "It led lo huge deficits as
a result. I just don't think vou can
cut taxes In a huge amount and re
duce debt. Clinton's policies have
w< irked."
Gore's plan of action
A centerpiece ol (lore's econom

wants to use $2.3 trillion ol the So

pay oil t he debt by 2012. By doing
so. the federal government will no
longer have to pay interest on the
debt, therefore freeing tax re
sources lor I letter use.
Gore supports tax abatement
lor working-class families and the
middle class through lax credits.
