# Ethernet connection speeds slower than usual
## University controls traffic because of band with problems; file-sharing programs like Napster cause jams

lias that ethernet connection in your dorm
room seemed a little bit slower this fall?
Hie speed of downloading information from
the Internet through University residences has
fallen precipitously this year. (lomputer usage has
skyrocketed, and the I diversity has capped Stan
ford's bandwidth accessibility.

Several times lasi year, according to Residential
(omputing officials, Stanford exceeded the band
width limit placed by the University'sethernet ser
vice provider, Cenuity.
"We have seen a lot of traffic from the dorm net
work, more than we can conveniently handle,"
said Stephen I lansen, Stanford's computer securi
ty offic er, in a September interview.
So more of the network could be retained for
academic: purpose, tins fall the University capped
the residential bandwidth — or the amount of in
formation that can travel at one time through a
single communications pathway.
"| It | was decided to start controlling traffic uti
lizing our Genuity connection," said [ay kohn,

head of net working at Stanford's (Communications
and Network Services Department. "Given tlie
highest levels of entertainment traffic were gener
ating from the residence networks, it was the logi
cal place to begin.
"Recognizing that residence traffic is mostly
generated during non-business hours, we were
willing to allocate 80 percent of our contracted
bandwidth to the residence networks, reserving
the remaining 20 percent for the balance of c am
pus," he added.
This capping prevents students from using
large parts of the bandwidth to download pro
grams «md files such as Ml\Ss, resulting in connec -
tions as slow as a 28.8 kilobits per second during
peak usage times in dorms.
For example, ii takes six minutes lo download a
one-megabyte file during peak hours, as opposed
to just 10 seconds during normal network perfor
mance. I he effect becomes even more noticeable
with larger downloads.
With the cost of an in-rooni connection reach
ing $80, in addition to Stanford's $35,000 price
tag, students are upset over the sudden drop in
network performance.
"The first week I was here, I was reaching
speeds ofsoo kilobytes per second." said freshman
Rebecca Dowell. "Now it's only a little faster than
my connection at home. No one told us that the
connection would be iliis slow.
Sophomore Gin is Landauer are disappointed
with the lack of student input in the decision to cap
the bandwidth.
"It's embarrassing that Stanford I niversity, in
the center of Silicon Valley and the launching pad
for so many computer companies, has sue ha slow
connection, he said. "Soon we will have sigus in
front of Brantier that say Don't forget to discon
nect your computer from the network." I here is a
fundamental quality of service students expect for
$80 a year."
Despite the cost, the computing contract be-
