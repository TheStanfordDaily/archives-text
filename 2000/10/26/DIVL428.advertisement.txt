AT AN INITIAL PRESS SCREENING FOR 'BOOK OF SHADOWS: BLAIR WITCH 2',
• INTERNET FILM GURU HARRY KNOWLES SAID THE FOLLOWING:
"Joe Berlinger has made a film that you folks that hated THE BLAJR WITCH PROJECT
will find intelligent, spooky, well-crafted and good...And for you folks that loved it, Berlinger advances,
comments, acknowledges and pays tribute to the power of the mythology that THE BLAIR WITCH
PROJECT cieated...while also commenting and satirizing the fandom and fanaticism that erupted around
the first film. 'BOOK OF SHADOWS BLAIR WITCH 2' is unique, different and good enough to
standxompletely apart and away from THE Blair WITCH PROJECT."
