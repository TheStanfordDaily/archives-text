For Cop's Torn Pants."
"Fora rip less than two inches long in
an officer's pants, Bob Thallon was sen
tenced to pay $15 in the Paly police court
yesterday. For disturbing the peace he was
penalized 10 hours' work or $5....
"More aftermath of the [Tomato] Festi
val developed last night when Kermit
Blood, a freshman who claimed he was in
jured by an officer during the clash, and a
Daily reporter interviewed Police Chief
1 loward /ink concerning his statement
that no clubs were used on the students.
"Saying he was misquoted, /ink de
clared that he had said 'to the best of his
knowledge' no clubs were used.
"The chief also stated that he was in
Mayfield at the time the trouble started
and based his conclusions on a sergeant's
report.
"/ink, in pleading lor amity between
the freshmen and the police force, said
that a number of young ollicers were in
the mix-up and that they probably lost
their tempers during the melee 'as any
young persons would do.'
"I ie said: 'I certainly hope that the Stan
lord freshmen will no longer bear us mal
ice, or hold ill feelings toward us.' "
Bottom Line: Frosh, learn your lesson. Don't
pick on the policemen and definitely don't rip
their pants.
