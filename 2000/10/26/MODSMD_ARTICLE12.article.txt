Gerhard Casper, 61, who stepped
down on Aug. 31 after eight years as
Stanford's president, was one of the
most successful university leaders of
the past decade. The German-born
Casper (now back to teaching consti
tutional law) came to the West Coast
after 25 years at the University of
Chicago. . . .
He introduced major changes in
the undergraduate curriculum,
raised record amounts of money and
oversaw $1 billion in campus con
struction — all the while nurturing
Stanford's symbiotic relationship
with Silicon Valley.
