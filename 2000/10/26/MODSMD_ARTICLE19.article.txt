### JOHN HENNESSY UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT PETER DREKMEIER STANFORD OPEN SPACE ALLIANCE CHAIR 
Stanford's land use plans arc designed to sup
port our fundamental mission as a university
and to assure that we will he able to pet form
that mission lot genet at ions to rome.
Id that end, out proposed (.eneral I se Permit in
cludes IS units of 'critically needed on-eampus
housing foi students and lac ultv, as well as academic
space to allow the I nivcrsih to sta\ on the frontier of
teaching, learning and 1 cscarc h.
We recognize, however. that we exist ,is a part of a
larger community, and that carrying out our mission
has an impact bevond our 8,000 ac res. Our package
also includes long-term preservation of open space in
the foothills and on campus, mitigations of traffic and
other environmental impacts and additional, volun
tas contributions to the community.
Oui current proposal is the product of an extensive,
two-vear study, including 10 public meetings and
hearings, \long the wav, Stanford has been willing to
compromise and revise its plans in response to com
munity needs and desires. Most importantly, we have
agreed to a 2~>-\ ear ac ademic growth boundary, rather
than our originalh proposed 10-vear boundary.
1 his collaborative process produced a plan, adopt
ed I>\ the ( onnt\ Planning ( onimission last I hursday,
that contains more than 200 conditions on Stanford's
General I se Permit. Stanford has accepted this as a
workable compromise.
I am disappointed th.it, with less than a week left in
a two-year process, unprecedented new conditions
have been interjected into the proposed (.eneral I se
Permit and Community Plan In County Supervisor
Joe Siniitian.
Last night, Mr. Simitian said: "During the course of
these past 18 months 1 have often heard or read the
suggestion that if Stanford University wants all this de
velopment they should be obliged to give us the open
space in the Foothills in exchange for that develop
ment. Let me just say, that's not the wa\ it works. At
least, that's not the wav it's supposed to work."
I nlbrtunatelv, the Supervisor's new condition of
"Compact Urban Development Commitment ( '.red
its" violates this very principle. We have been advised
that this dedication requirement is unlawful, and we
believe it is unwarranted, particularly given that we
have in >t proposed any development in the 2,100 acres
in the Foothills.
Moreover, the 2">-\cai academic growth boundary
provides ample protection lor the Foothills. Supervi
sor Simitian's preliminary proposal to require 99-ycai
easements ties the hands, not just of Stanford, but of
future Boards of Supervisors, which will have current
information on which to balance the needs and inter
ests of t he public and Stanford.
Ninety-nine vears ago Stanford was a dramatically
different place than it is today. Residents and public of
ficials could not have predicted 90 years ago what
Stanford and the community would need today.
Both the I'rustees and I view these new conditions
as unacceptable. Unless these conditions are removed,
I believe we will not be able to accept the new (icneral
I se Permit. Our new housing and ac ademic facilities
will be on indefinite hold.
VVe hope that Supervisor Simitian's preliminary
thinking on this issue will c hange before the Board of
Supervisors' vote next week to embrace the carefully
crafted compromises contained in the plan adopted by
the Planning (Commission.
I lie- Stanford I niversity trustees, under the terms
of their duties, cannot surrender the rights to 1,000
acres of Stanford property for the next century.

Usually when we talk about Stanford, we're
refering to one ol the greatest academic insti
tutions in the world. I lowever, there's anoth
er side to the University that we rarely hear
about: the Stanford Management Company.
I lie Management Company oversees the develop
ment of Stanford's vast land-holdings, making it the
largest developer on the Peninsula. Unfortunately, its
mission is often given priority over the academic branch
of the University.
In recent vears, the CEO of the Management
Compain has earned twice as much as Stanford's
president.
I he Stanford Open Spate Alliance was formed last
year in response to Stanford's development plan calling
for 1.8 million square feet of development over the next
10 years.
I his would result in a .">Â«S percent increase in the
si/.e of the campus, or the equivalent of three new
Stanford Shopping Centers, in just 10 years. Despite
this massive amount of development, Stanford is un
willing to (ommit to a single acre of permanent open
space protection.
I lie plan also would allow Stanford to extend its core
campus into the recentlv-named "Lathrop District" of
the 112 oothills. In typical Stanford public-relations talk,
the administration claims there will be no development
iu the "Foothills District," but they don't mention that
the district keeps shrinking as they rename areas they
would like to develop.
Stanford's development plan will have huge impacts
on the l uiversitv and surrounding communities. The
Environmental Impact Report states, "Significant un
avoidable impacts occur in five different areas: open
space, traffic and circulation, historic resources, con
struction noise and growth inducement." As mitigation
lor these impacts, Stanford should set aside the Foothills
as permanent open space.
Last Monday night, the Palo Alto City Counc il voted
unanimously to encourage the (bounty to require per
manent open space protection as a condition of Stan
ford's development permit.
One of their legal memos reads, "It is legally possible
to obtain permanent open space protection of the Stan
ford Foothills with a c luster / transfer of development
rights plan of the t\ pe advocated by the (Committee lor
(ireen Foothills."
I nlortunatelv, Supervisor Joe Siniitian is not willing
to go 11 iis lar. However, he is proposing a plan that
would require Stanford to set aside one acre in the
Foothills for 09 years for every 2,000 square feet of aca
demic development.
Therefore, if the I niversity builds the 2 million
square feet proposed in this plan, 1,000 acres would be
protected for 09 years.
As the son of two Stanford professors, I know t his is a
great university, and it has the potential to be even bet
ter. We have an opportunity right now to ac t as a role
model in sustainable development at a time when the
region, and world, is looking for leadership.
We need smart growth that puts people close to class
rooms, services and public transportation and keeps
sprawl out of the Foothills.
From our outreach efforts, I'm certain the vast ma
jority of the Stanford community supports protection of
the Foothills. It's time for the Stanford trustees to listen
to us.

tutions in the world. I lowever, there's anoth
er side to the University that we rarely hear
about: the Stanford Management Company.
I lie Management Company oversees the develop
ment of Stanford's vast land-holdings, making it the
largest developer on the Peninsula. Unfortunately, its
mission is often given priority over the academic branch
of the University.
In recent vears, the CEO of the Management
Compain has earned twice as much as Stanford's
president.
I he Stanford Open Spate Alliance was formed last
year in response to Stanford's development plan calling
for 1.8 million square feet of development over the next
10 years.
I his would result in a .">Â«S percent increase in the
si/.e of the campus, or the equivalent of three new
Stanford Shopping Centers, in just 10 years. Despite
this massive amount of development, Stanford is un
willing to (ommit to a single acre of permanent open
space protection.
I lie plan also would allow Stanford to extend its core
campus into the recentlv-named "Lathrop District" of
the 112 oothills. In typical Stanford public-relations talk,
the administration claims there will be no development
iu the "Foothills District," but they don't mention that
the district keeps shrinking as they rename areas they
would like to develop.
Stanford's development plan will have huge impacts
on the l uiversitv and surrounding communities. The
Environmental Impact Report states, "Significant un
avoidable impacts occur in five different areas: open
space, traffic and circulation, historic resources, con
struction noise and growth inducement." As mitigation
lor these impacts, Stanford should set aside the Foothills
as permanent open space.
Last Monday night, the Palo Alto City Counc il voted
unanimously to encourage the (bounty to require per
manent open space protection as a condition of Stan
ford's development permit.
One of their legal memos reads, "It is legally possible
to obtain permanent open space protection of the Stan
ford Foothills with a c luster / transfer of development
rights plan of the t\ pe advocated by the (Committee lor
(ireen Foothills."
I nlortunatelv, Supervisor Joe Siniitian is not willing
to go 11 iis lar. However, he is proposing a plan that
would require Stanford to set aside one acre in the
Foothills for 09 years for every 2,000 square feet of aca
demic development.
Therefore, if the I niversity builds the 2 million
square feet proposed in this plan, 1,000 acres would be
protected for 09 years.
As the son of two Stanford professors, I know t his is a
great university, and it has the potential to be even bet
ter. We have an opportunity right now to ac t as a role
model in sustainable development at a time when the
region, and world, is looking for leadership.
We need smart growth that puts people close to class
rooms, services and public transportation and keeps
sprawl out of the Foothills.
From our outreach efforts, I'm certain the vast ma
jority of the Stanford community supports protection of
the Foothills. It's time for the Stanford trustees to listen
to us.
Stanford's land use plans arc designed to sup
port our fundamental mission as a university
and to assure that we will he able to pet form
that mission lot genet at ions to rome.
Id that end, out proposed (.eneral I se Permit in
cludes IS units of 'critically needed on-eampus
housing foi students and lac ultv, as well as academic
space to allow the I nivcrsih to sta\ on the frontier of
teaching, learning and 1 cscarc h.
We recognize, however. that we exist ,is a part of a
larger community, and that carrying out our mission
has an impact bevond our 8,000 ac res. Our package
also includes long-term preservation of open space in
the foothills and on campus, mitigations of traffic and
other environmental impacts and additional, volun
tas contributions to the community.
Oui current proposal is the product of an extensive,
two-vear study, including 10 public meetings and
hearings, \long the wav, Stanford has been willing to
compromise and revise its plans in response to com
munity needs and desires. Most importantly, we have
agreed to a 2~>-\ ear ac ademic growth boundary, rather
than our originalh proposed 10-vear boundary.
1 his collaborative process produced a plan, adopt
ed I>\ the ( onnt\ Planning ( onimission last I hursday,
that contains more than 200 conditions on Stanford's
General I se Permit. Stanford has accepted this as a
workable compromise.
I am disappointed th.it, with less than a week left in
a two-year process, unprecedented new conditions
have been interjected into the proposed (.eneral I se
Permit and Community Plan In County Supervisor
Joe Siniitian.
Last night, Mr. Simitian said: "During the course of
these past 18 months 1 have often heard or read the
suggestion that if Stanford University wants all this de
velopment they should be obliged to give us the open
space in the Foothills in exchange for that develop
ment. Let me just say, that's not the wa\ it works. At
least, that's not the wav it's supposed to work."
I nlbrtunatelv, the Supervisor's new condition of
"Compact Urban Development Commitment ( '.red
its" violates this very principle. We have been advised
that this dedication requirement is unlawful, and we
believe it is unwarranted, particularly given that we
have in >t proposed any development in the 2,100 acres
in the Foothills.
Moreover, the 2">-\cai academic growth boundary
provides ample protection lor the Foothills. Supervi
sor Simitian's preliminary proposal to require 99-ycai
easements ties the hands, not just of Stanford, but of
future Boards of Supervisors, which will have current
information on which to balance the needs and inter
ests of t he public and Stanford.
Ninety-nine vears ago Stanford was a dramatically
different place than it is today. Residents and public of
ficials could not have predicted 90 years ago what
Stanford and the community would need today.
Both the I'rustees and I view these new conditions
as unacceptable. Unless these conditions are removed,
I believe we will not be able to accept the new (icneral
I se Permit. Our new housing and ac ademic facilities
will be on indefinite hold.
VVe hope that Supervisor Simitian's preliminary
thinking on this issue will c hange before the Board of
Supervisors' vote next week to embrace the carefully
crafted compromises contained in the plan adopted by
the Planning (Commission.
I lie- Stanford I niversity trustees, under the terms
of their duties, cannot surrender the rights to 1,000
acres of Stanford property for the next century.
