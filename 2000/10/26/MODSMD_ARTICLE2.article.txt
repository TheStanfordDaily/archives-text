# Simitian calls for 99-year Foothill protection
## 
### GREG BRAZEAL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Santa Clara County Supervisor Joe
Simiiian proposed I uesclay that tlie L'ni
versit\ set aside half of the foothills from
development lor .1 period of 99 years in
exchange for building 2 million square
feet of academic !a< ilities, a proposal that
University President |olin Hennessy
called "unacceptable."
According to Simiiian," I lie net result
of such .111 approach, should Stanford
elect to proceed with .ill 2,0.5f),000 square
feet of development, is that a little more
than 1,000 acres above |unipero Serra
Boulevard would be protected from
sprawl fora period of 99 years."
The I niversity "cannot surrender the
1 igliis to 1,000 acres of [its] property lor
the next century," responded Hennessy
in a statement released yesterday. 1 1c
characterized the proposal as "unlawful
and . .. unwarranted."
The Palo Alto Citv Council lias ob
tained a legal opinion arguing that per
manent open space dedication would be
within die county's legal rights because of
the impacts of Stanford's development
on the c<immunity-
Simiiian and the irst of the Board of
Supervisors will vole on Stanford's Gen
eral Use Plan on l uesday. The plan sets
guidelines I<>l Stanford's development
during the next 10 years.
According to I forton, the Board of Su
pervisors has a tradition of "district def
erence," meaning the other supervisors

will probabh vote along the same lines as
Simitian, who represents the area con
taining Stanford's land on the Hoard.
Director ol'Cio\eminent and (lommu
nitv Relations Larry Horton said Stan
ford amid pursue a lawsuit or other legal
a< lion alter reviewing the (ountv s action
next week. 1 lie decision to lile a lawsuit
would tlepend on the specific results of
the ('.ounty's vote and the advice of Stan
lord's lawyers.
Simitian proposed a concept called

Compact I than Development Credits.
The credits would allow the I nivcrsit\ to
develop 2,000 square led olacademit fa
cilities for even .it re <>l the Foothills that
it commits to "long-term uses of a less in
tense nature."
I he\ would be enforced lor 90 years
or as long as the new buildings stand,
whichever period is shorter.
"In short, we can make the commit
ment to compact urban development
lasting rather than transiton. Simitian

said.
He suggested that ii was the county's
obligation to ensure that the compact
urban development contained in Stan
lord's current application does not lead
lo urban sprawl in Inline years.
Simitian also pointed out that Stan
ford has already accepted modifications
to its plan that would protect the full
2,200 acres of the Foothills lor 25 years
and designate them as "Open Space-
Field Research" or "Special (Conservation
Area."
"A General Plan designation like
'()pen Spat e-Field Research' is unlimited
in iisduration," Simitian said. "Ii remains
in place until and unless an allirmative
action is taken by our Board of Supervi
sors to change the designation."
Stanford has suggested that any re
quirement of Foothill protection over 25
years would be unacceptable.
Simitian's proposal "appears to be in
direct contradiction lo what had been es
tablished as ihe limit beyond which we
could go," Norton said. "But we really
have lo studv it and see what it means."
Hennessy s statement noted thai the
County's planning stall'proposed onh a
25-year academic growth boundary to
limit Foothill development. A< cording to
the statement, the County's report also
rejected a concept similar to Simitian's
proposal.
Similian made deal that lit- does not
consider the 99-year dedication a taking
ol Stanlord's lands.
"I have often heard or read the sug

gestion that if Stanford I niversitv wants
all this development they should be oblig
ed to give us lilt- open space in the
Foothills in exchange lor that develop
ment.' Simitian said. "Thai's not the wa\
it works."
I lennessy criticized Simitian for intro
ducing these new conditions with less
than a week until the end of the two-year
approval process. Morton said lit- had
never heard ol the credits belbre Simitian
proposed them.
II the remaining supervisors endorse
Simitian's recommendations when the
board meets on Tuesday, Norton said
Stanford would apply "relatively soon' to
build 2f>o units of housing on the May
lield site in the C lit\ of Palo Alio. The I ni
versity earlier ollered the site* to the i it\
lot a badly needed cominunitv (enter,
but the donation is contingent on the ap
proval of a land-use plan acceptable to
the University.
"The most important thing is that we
be able to house our students, faculty and
stall." 1 lorton said.
Ilennessv's statement, along with
background on the issue, will be sent elec
tronically to students, faculty, stall and
alumni this week.
After Simitian's announcement, envi
ronmental groups such as the Stanford
Open Space Alliance reaffirmed the
county's right to demand permanent
open space dedication. According to al
liance spokesman Peter Drekmeier. the


AARON STAPLE/The Stanford Daily
coalition has collec ted more than
15.000 signatures in support ol
permanent 1\ preserving the
l< >< >t bills.
"We still leel strough that Stan
lord should set aside the foothills
.is permanent open space," Drek
mciersaid."We'ieasking only that
you treat Stanford as any other
private property owner."
Similian's announcement also
included a proposal loi what he
called a "loose linkage" between
the development of academic labil
ities .md housing on c ampus. Ac -
cording to the linkage policy, the
University would be required to
build housing in landem with ils
academic lac ilnics in ore lei lo oil
set increased housing needs.
I lie linkage formula would
lorce ihe I Diversity lo build at
least 2.120 units ol housing il n de
veloped ilic lull 2 million square
leet ol academic facilities.
Representatives ol the Gradu
ate Student Gouncil applauded
the linkage lot inula as a wav lo en
sure' lb,il Stanlorcl would build the
housing ii promised.
"I'm ver\ much encouraged b\
the indications I heai from you,"
said doctoral student Paul llartke,
chair ol the Graduate Student
Gouncil. "I think linkages are ex-

Ac tly ilie way to go."
Stanford's plans show thai ii will
set aside 7K percent of the new
housing lor low-income students
,iii(l si .ill but Simitian refrained
Ik>lll requiring the University to
set aside a specific amount exclu
sive!) lor graduate students.
"Stanford will presumably have
to price its units at a level which al
lows the I niversity to continue to
attract the best and brightest,"
Simitian said, "and I am not in
clined to think it appropriate lor
our county t<> prescribe the cost of
university housing."
In addition to the housing that
would be required through the
linkage program, Simitian en
couraged the Universitx to build
about (>()() further units of hous
ing. in line with the total proposal
<>l !i,()()() houses.
During public comments alter
Siiniiian's presentation, the Uni
versity and its supporters ex
pressed worries that .1 rigid link
age program could stille Stan
lord's academic growth.
I lie I niversitv's greatest worry
remains the possibility of perma
nently losing control of the
Fc xitliills.
"We are deeply concerned
about the proposal to require ded
i< at ions of some lorm on Stanford
land," I lorion said. "IfStanlbrd is
unable to obtain a package that
permits the University to use its
(oui)t\ lands to house its students,

faculty and stall and provide need
ed education laulities, this process
will have laileci. Stanford and the
community will be worse oil and
no one will be a winner.'
University supporters such as
the recently-lbrmed Citizens lor
Stanford and the Community
cited the advantages ol flexible
land-use planning, given the pos
sibility of unpredictable future de
velopment needs.
I hev encouraged the county to
show a greater degree ol trust to
ward the University and toward
their successors on the Board ol
Supervisors.
Vice Provost lor Student Allairs
James Montova suggested that
flexible planning can help support
a diverse community. I le drew at
tention to the changing nature of
student needs, such as the growing
number ol students with physical
and learning disabilities that re
quire expanded space.
" flic flexibility lor us to build
the new facilities to support our
students with disabilities is cru
cial," Montova said. " len sears
ago we did not know that such <1 re

According to I lorion, more
than hall ol the (Â»() speakers at the

'()pen Spat e-Field Research' is unlimited

in place until and unless an allirmative

Stanford has suggested that any re
quirement of Foothill protection over 25
years would be unacceptable.
Simitian's proposal "appears to be in
direct contradiction lo what had been es
tablished as ihe limit beyond which we
could go," Norton said. "But we really
have lo studv it and see what it means."
Hennessy s statement noted thai the
County's planning stall'proposed onh a
25-year academic growth boundary to
limit Foothill development. A< cording to
the statement, the County's report also
rejected a concept similar to Simitian's
proposal.
Similian made deal that lit- does not
consider the 99-year dedication a taking
ol Stanlord's lands.
"I have often heard or read the sug

gestion that if Stanford I niversitv wants
all this development they should be oblig
ed to give us lilt- open space in the
Foothills in exchange lor that develop
ment.' Simitian said. "Thai's not the wa\
it works."
I lennessy criticized Simitian for intro
ducing these new conditions with less

approval process. Morton said lit- had

Stanford would apply "relatively soon' to

Ilennessv's statement, along with

After Simitian's announcement, envi
ronmental groups such as the Stanford
Open Space Alliance reaffirmed the
county's right to demand permanent
open space dedication. According to al

"We still leel strough that Stan

Similian's announcement also
included a proposal loi what he
called a "loose linkage" between
the development of academic labil
ities .md housing on c ampus. Ac -
cording to the linkage policy, the
University would be required to
build housing in landem with ils

Representatives ol the Gradu

the linkage lot inula as a wav lo en

"I'm ver\ much encouraged b\
the indications I heai from you,"
said doctoral student Paul llartke,
chair ol the Graduate Student
Gouncil. "I think linkages are ex-

Ac tly ilie way to go."
Stanford's plans show thai ii will
set aside 7K percent of the new
housing lor low-income students
,iii(l si .ill but Simitian refrained
Ik>lll requiring the University to
set aside a specific amount exclu
sive!) lor graduate students.
"Stanford will presumably have
to price its units at a level which al
lows the I niversity to continue to
attract the best and brightest,"
Simitian said, "and I am not in
clined to think it appropriate lor
our county t<> prescribe the cost of
university housing."
In addition to the housing that
would be required through the
linkage program, Simitian en
couraged the Universitx to build
about (>()() further units of hous

<>l !i,()()() houses.
During public comments alter
Siiniiian's presentation, the Uni

pressed worries that .1 rigid link

I lie I niversitv's greatest worry
remains the possibility of perma

Fc xitliills.
"We are deeply concerned
about the proposal to require ded

University supporters such as
the recently-lbrmed Citizens lor
Stanford and the Community
cited the advantages ol flexible
land-use planning, given the pos

I hev encouraged the county to
show a greater degree ol trust to

Vice Provost lor Student Allairs
James Montova suggested that
flexible planning can help support
a diverse community. I le drew at

student needs, such as the growing
number ol students with physical

quire expanded space.
" flic flexibility lor us to build

Santa Clara County Supervisor Joe
Simiiian proposed I uesclay that tlie L'ni
versit\ set aside half of the foothills from
development lor .1 period of 99 years in
exchange for building 2 million square
feet of academic !a< ilities, a proposal that
University President |olin Hennessy
called "unacceptable."
According to Simiiian," I lie net result
of such .111 approach, should Stanford
elect to proceed with .ill 2,0.5f),000 square
feet of development, is that a little more
than 1,000 acres above |unipero Serra

The I niversity "cannot surrender the
1 igliis to 1,000 acres of [its] property lor
the next century," responded Hennessy
in a statement released yesterday. 1 1c
characterized the proposal as "unlawful
and . .. unwarranted."

Simiiian and the irst of the Board of

guidelines I<>l Stanford's development
during the next 10 years.
According to I forton, the Board of Su
pervisors has a tradition of "district def
erence," meaning the other supervisors

will probabh vote along the same lines as
Simitian, who represents the area con
taining Stanford's land on the Hoard.
Director ol'Cio\eminent and (lommu
nitv Relations Larry Horton said Stan
ford amid pursue a lawsuit or other legal
a< lion alter reviewing the (ountv s action
next week. 1 lie decision to lile a lawsuit
would tlepend on the specific results of
the ('.ounty's vote and the advice of Stan
lord's lawyers.
Simitian proposed a concept called

Compact I than Development Credits.
The credits would allow the I nivcrsit\ to
develop 2,000 square led olacademit fa
cilities for even .it re <>l the Foothills that
it commits to "long-term uses of a less in
tense nature."
I he\ would be enforced lor 90 years
or as long as the new buildings stand,
whichever period is shorter.
"In short, we can make the commit
ment to compact urban development
lasting rather than transiton. Simitian

said.
He suggested that ii was the county's
obligation to ensure that the compact
urban development contained in Stan
lord's current application does not lead
lo urban sprawl in Inline years.
Simitian also pointed out that Stan
ford has already accepted modifications
to its plan that would protect the full
2,200 acres of the Foothills lor 25 years
and designate them as "Open Space-
Field Research" or "Special (Conservation
