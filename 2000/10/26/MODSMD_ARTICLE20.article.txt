# SUMMARY JUDGMENT
## It's time for Congress to protect our internet privacy 
### 
Wlk'ii you lni\ s<xiiething on
line, you |>;i\ not onl\ with
your credit card but also
with your privacy.
K-commerce sites like Amazon.com re
<|uire thai you provide personal informa
tion, such .is your name and address. I'su
all \ such sites in lo reassure customers
11 nit their customer data will remain pri
vate and not he sold to others.
II you are si ill worried about vour pri
vacy online, you have good reason lo be.
I hree recent events show that inciustr\
sell-regulation will not protect cvber-pri
\acy and that federal intervention is in
creasingly warranted, despite reassur
ances from Internet companies.
I low valuable is our privacv? Keep in
mind cvber-privac\ in< ludes not onlv vour
personal information â€” ranging from
your name to vour Social Sccurit \ number
but also your activities online. Did you
visit a Web site for recovering from drug
addiction? Did you search Ama/on.com
lor sell-help books on impotence?

\ our online trail is
compiled by Internet
companies with huge
databases teeming
with private informa
tion. Assembled into
individual marketing
profiles and sold lo the
highest bidder, the
economic value of such

individual lost privacy may be slight. But,
subjectivel\. bartering the intimate details
ola person's life can be too high a price for
online convenience.
Such worries lead to the creation of In
ternet privacy policies, now posted on about
80 percent of all sites. I lowever, an incident
involving a failing Internet company called
11 >\ smari.ee >111 suggests that they are mean
ingless. l ac ing bankruptcy, Toysniart.com
tried to sell its entire customer database, in
spite ol the fact that its privacy policy
promised that this information would never
be shared with anvbody else.
I ethnic a 11 \. the current U.S. law

would let them sell everything they knew
about you if they chose to do so. I lowev
er, the Federal Trade (Commission did in
tervene in this case to stop the sale, reach
ing a settlement with loysmart.com in
August.
1 heToysmart case forecasts two alarm
ing trends: First, there is an interest in
buying and selling consumer data collect
ed online and, second, even when a dot
com promises they will not share your per
sonal information, they can legally violate
their promises. As more and more dot
coms start going out of business, many w ill
be tempted to do so.
1 he most startling case is Ama/on.com.
Like Toysmart, Amazon promised that c us
tomer information would not be sold tooth
ers without consent. On Aug. 31, Amazon
amended its privacy policy to inform shop
pers that this was no longer the case. In ad
dition to several other exceptions, the policy
gives notice that .ill customer information
could become a "transferred business asset."
While this policy stills provides an option to

opt-out. In default, the fact that you were
searching lor books on gay lifestyles could
wind up sellable information.
At least Amazon.com is being honest
about its real policy. It explicitly states that
the privacy notice changes constantly and
that use of current gathered customer in
formation will be subject to future privacy
policies. Many other dot-coms are not
bothering to give such notice at all.
So il a company like Amazon.com sold
your private information, could you sue
them? It's doubtful.
1 his month, the Supreme (Court re
fused to hear a case against America On
line, which included a complaint of not
pi otectingc ustomers' pi ivacy. I he lawsuit
argued that A()l. should be considered a
"common carrier," like radio or the phone
companies, thus regulated In the FI (C on
issues like privacy. I lie (Court's refusal to
hear the case means that FFCC interven
tion like that in the Toysinart case will be
the exception, rather than the rule.
If the courts are reluctant to protect

cyber-privacy, it is up to Congress to act.
Congress has deferred action, despite
many citizen demands foi privacv protec -
tion. in order to allow industry sell-regula
tion. The I oysmart, Amazon and A()L in
cidents suggest that self-regulation is not
working. Some simple rules, similar to
those used by Stanford, would help guar
antee privacy.
First, Internet companies should let
customers know what information has
been collec ted on them. Sue h information
about Stanford students is available for
student review .it http://stanlordvou.stan
lbrd.edu. Second, as here at Stanford, cus
tomers should have the option to keep this
information complete!) private. I nlike
the mutable privacy polio Amazon has.
we need a law to make such policies en
forceable. ()therwise, we w ill never be sure
that toda\ s confidentialities won't become
tomorrc>w's commodities.
