# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Seize the day, take risks and leave overachievement behind 
### DAVID ABRAMS GUEST COLUMNIST 
Ai <1 recent campus oriental ion lor
high si liool students, a group ol the stu
dents and their parents were sitting
around wailing lor the talk to begin. I <>
warm up the crowd, the session leader
asked a partic ulai student w hat interests
she might want to put sue ai Stanford. A
look ol panic came over the student's
lace. Aftet a long awkward silence, she
asked the session leader il he was refer
ring to academic pursuits 01 c\iracurn< -
ular activities. I hat is, was il the response
i<> question 2 oi to (|iiestion ~>c Irom the
Stanlbrd (lollcge application that she was
being asked to supph ?

Sound like an overreaction? lo all but
a lew thousand high school seniors and
(licit parents, I he young woman's hesita
tion would have seemed absurd. But per
haps her trepidation was the best evi
dence of.ill that she would lit right in at
Stanlbrd. Let's lace it: Kxcessive (ear of
failure is evervwhere in the Stanford so
c iet\ — in the faculty, the graduate stu
dents and, most of all, the undergradu
ates. We are overac hievers of the highest
degree.
It is the willingness to come from far
and w ide lor a world c lass university that
has brought us here, an innate drive to
seek the best from ourselves, our peers,
our institutions — the world. This spirit,
w liich leads us to compete to our utmost,

to hold ourselves out against all comers,
is evident in our high school student,
valiantly beginning the competition lor
entrance to t his school, a contest in which
only 15 percent prevail.
But, while this worthy competitive
spirit is present here, as with the student,
it often goes hand-in-hand with a stilling
conservative impulse: Don't risk giving
the wrong answer to the question. Don't
risk an A- on that midterm fora blind
date — back to the library. Don't let the
thoughts stray too far from the research
at hand — that could waste valuable time.
I his is not the way to live lilt* to its fullest,
but too often it is the way those in our so
ciety with the most potential choose to
live.

Kvery day oilers myriad opportuni
ties. Stop bypassing them. Instead ol star
ingat those mountains oil in the distance,
take one afternoon out of your years here
and climb them! Stop wondering if you
could have gotten the part and go to the
theater audition! And that book wasting
away on your shell? Read it! Not because
you have to, not because your professor
told you to, not because it's what yon said
you'd do, but because it's there — be
cause you are alive and you c an.
I lie daily grind. I he schedule. 1 lie
planner. Ugly, ugly words. I hese are
things that make us feel important, make
us organized, make us productive. Not
wholly bad things, indeed sometimes
necessary, but also sometimes destine

live. They are not the stuff of life, just
filler between birth and death. Routine
comes easy and sometimes it's a conve
nient way to avoid feelings and thoughts
we're afraid of exploring. Thinking and
rethinking the basic tenets and dec isions
of one's life can be excruciating. Hut it
will be rewarding, and not just for you.
Forget about that scary A-. The world,
not just the investment banks and con
sulting firms, needs the talents and the
drive of our best. You are the best. I se
vour brain; use vour bodv. I .ive vour life.
