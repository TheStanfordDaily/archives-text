free public ac cess to private lands; very

greater "County control" over Stanford

Make no mistake — the Simitian

Stanford land isn't for neighbors' dogs
I lie Daily has published in recent weeks
.in avalanche of letters from our Palo Alto
neighlxirs, some claiming it is their God
given right to walk (doggedly or not) on
Stanford land, and to prevent the Universi
ty from building on it.
Some of these neighbors have long been
around, some arrived as recently as two
yeai s ago. For one of them at least, a major
lure (to paraphrase his words) was our
open spates.
I his is the point. I he University has had
to face two of'the effects of the Valley's pros

pcrily — clogging and inflation. The in
crease in the population means increased
demands on the lands that Stanford has in
its stewardship. I lie campus itself has been
invaded by dog-walkers, as the appearance
in the Quad of the unprecedented — the
occasional canine dropping — testifies.
Some of our neighbors, true to the Pio
neer spirit, believe that what belongs to a
different group is land for them to home
stead. They may not go as far, perhaps, as
to scalp a few junior faculty for the right to
run our paths or walk war-hounds. But
their opposition to Stanford's building on
its land does mean that we are finding it
harder to recruit wary younger scholars
and to keep those already here, who are de
moralized by the local inflation. For the stu
dent body, this already means a higher
turnover in mentors, professors living far
ther away and therefore less available, and
less stellar faculty.
Evidently, the primary responsibility is
with the University to pay ns living wages
(and not charge us market price for hous
ing or daycare), but I can imagine the an
noyance of our polite administration at the
complication introduced by self-centered
self-styled community voices that see only
their desires and needs. Those less polite
than our deans, provosts and presidents,
and unlike them not bound by office, will
write what they think.

Look at the whole picture in
Middle East conflict
In Wedensday's Daily. MSAN seems
content to use the tragi< death of a 12
year-old to bolster their cause. What they
don't seem content to do. with six pictures
in a lull-page ad, is to show even one with
the camera zoomed out.
If they did, the readers would have
seen the bov and his father in close prox
imity on both sides with Palestinian po
licemen firing their automatic weapons
at Israeli soldiers. When the soldiers
fired back, the death of a 12-year-old was
the unfortunate result. I he image
MSAN tries to pot ray of Israeli troops
targeting innocent children is false and
irresponsible.
I hese pictures showing the entire bat
tle with the child (aught in the cross-fire
are readily available on the Web, and
some ns had considered using them to
counteract a growing anti-Israeli senti
ment but concluded that it would be in
bad taste. I'd like to thank MSAN for re
minding lis what bad taste is .ill about.
Even more misleading, and even easi
er to refute, is their assertion that "Israel
is using heavy weapons such as anti-tank
rockets and Apache helicopters' to re
press demonstrators. Surely, with tens of
thousands of demonstrators altat king Is
raeli posts every day, if Israel was re
sponding m the manner they've been ac

cuscd of, tin' death toll would Ih* thou
sands pel" day, not I over the course ol
a month. Remember rienncmcn Square.
1989? I low many died there?
My point is that Israel has done what
ever possible to defend themselves while
minimizing the casualties, and 1 don't
want anyone to take mv word lor it.
When one learns that someone has been
killed, 1 simply want the reader to ask
more than "How old were they?" Ask
where they were and what they were
doing. Ask il the soldiers inunediateb
lired at them, or il the) first tried tear gas,
then rubber coated bullets and then pro
gressed to live ammo when it was their
only means of survival.
I he heart ol the problem is that Pales
tinians have been taught that mobbing Is
raeli posts with stones and molotav co< k
lails, often flanked In armed Palestinian
police, is a noble thing to do (interviews
with Palestinian youths in this week's
lime magazine show this beliel), and the
death toll is the inevitable consequence.
I he recent lynching of Israeli soldiers as
Palestinian crowds beat them to death
threw theii bodies out of a window and
then kicked the dead bodies .is crowds
i heel ed, further elucidates how thc\ have
been educated. I mil they are educated
differently, a warm peace will never be

Stanford land isn't for neighbors' dogs
I lie Daily has published in recent weeks
.in avalanche of letters from our Palo Alto
neighlxirs, some claiming it is their God
given right to walk (doggedly or not) on
Stanford land, and to prevent the Universi
ty from building on it.
Some of these neighbors have long been
around, some arrived as recently as two
yeai s ago. For one of them at least, a major
lure (to paraphrase his words) was our
open spates.
I his is the point. I he University has had
to face two of'the effects of the Valley's pros

pcrily — clogging and inflation. The in
crease in the population means increased
demands on the lands that Stanford has in
its stewardship. I lie campus itself has been
invaded by dog-walkers, as the appearance
in the Quad of the unprecedented — the
occasional canine dropping — testifies.
Some of our neighbors, true to the Pio
neer spirit, believe that what belongs to a
different group is land for them to home
stead. They may not go as far, perhaps, as
to scalp a few junior faculty for the right to
run our paths or walk war-hounds. But
their opposition to Stanford's building on
its land does mean that we are finding it
harder to recruit wary younger scholars
and to keep those already here, who are de
moralized by the local inflation. For the stu
dent body, this already means a higher
turnover in mentors, professors living far
ther away and therefore less available, and
less stellar faculty.
Evidently, the primary responsibility is
with the University to pay ns living wages
(and not charge us market price for hous
ing or daycare), but I can imagine the an
noyance of our polite administration at the
complication introduced by self-centered
self-styled community voices that see only
their desires and needs. Those less polite
than our deans, provosts and presidents,
and unlike them not bound by office, will
write what they think.

If they did, the readers would have
