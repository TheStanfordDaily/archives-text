# Simitian, Hennessy square off on land use

I dih)) \ Xoh Hie following has been exterftled from Santa
Clara (.minly Supervisor Joseph Sirnilian's statement re
leased l'nesda\ niglit at the publu meeting regarding his
-i'ieuis on Stanford's (ieneral I se /'lan.
. . . \s I review ilie recommendations from Plan
ning Siall .ind ilie Planning Commission, I ask six
questions about t lie ret oinnientletl course of action:
I )oes ii allow ilie applicant i<> make good and pro
ductive use<>! tlie propem?
I)<u sit ensure 11lai the applit ant will mitigate any
advei se imp.uls ai ising from the proposed use?
Is ilie pr<>|x>s.il environmental!) appropriate,and
consistent with sound land use planning practices?
1 )<>es the pi ivate use respet:t the public interest?
— Is it lair?
— \nd is it legal?
rhese are the criteria I've applied in reaching
some tentative cone lnsions about the Stanford CUP
antl ( onimnnilN Plan. All that having been saitl, let
me now ollei some specif it comments on the sub
stance ol the applicant >ll.

The boUt>m fine
Stanford's Community Plan and CUP applita
tioii ask that the (lonntv anthori/e the tfevelopinent
of 2,035,000 square feet of academic facilities and tip
to 3,018 housing units (estimated to make up anoth
er 2.8 million square feet of development).
My inclination is to say yes — yes to all ol it — but
only il it is well-designed, carefully planned, appro
priately located antl eflectivcl\ mitigated.
By any reasonable standard, 4.8 million square
feet is a lot of development. Simply put, Stanford
wants to "grow" its tore campus In more than a third
in the next 10 years, and seeks approval from our
County to dt) so ... .
By its nature the (lommunity Plan and (il P ap
plication process is a request lor an additional incre
ment of development rather than a long-term at
tempt to plan lot the whole, loi that reason, 1 am
not inclined to propose that our Board establish a
permanent cap or attempt to define at this point the

Editors Mole: The following is Stanford's response to
Suntn Clam County Supervisor foe Swiitian \ proposal
written Iry University President John Hennessy and re
leased today.
I am disappointed thai, with less than a week left
in a two-year process, unprecedented new condi
tions have been interjected into the proposed Com
niunit\ Plan and General Use Permit lor Stanford
tli.it was adopted In the Santa Glara County Plan
ning Commission last I hursday.
Last night, Mr. Simitian said, "During the course ol
these past 1 «S months I have often heard or read the
suggestion that il Stanford I Diversity wants all this
development the\ should be obliged to give us the
open space in the foothills in exchange for that devel
opment. Let me just say, that's not the way it works. At
least, that's not the way it's supposed to work."
Unfortunately, the Supervisor's new condition
of "Compact Urban Development Commitment
(iredits" violates this very principle. This would re
quire Stanford to grant 99-year easements to the
(.(Hinty for 1,000 acres of loothills in exchange for

academic development for the next ten years. We
have been advised that this dedication requirement
is unlawful, and we believe it is unwarranted.
Alter exhaustive study, the County stall has con
cluded that the proposed Stanford development re
sults m no significant open space impacts. Stanford
has not proposed am development in the 2,100
acres in the foothills.
As both the independent environmental experts
who prepared the KIR and the County's own staff
have stated, no further mitigation is required. In
fact, concepts similar to the "Compact Urban De
velopment Credits" were considered and rejected
In the (lounty staff.
We hope that Supervisor Simitian's preliminary
thinking on this issue will (hange before the Board
of Supervisors' vote next week and he will embrace
the carefully t railed compromises contained in the
report adopted In the Planning ('.ommission.
The Stanford University trustees, under the
terms of their duties, cannot surrender the rights
to 1,000 acres of Stanford property for the i\ext
century.
