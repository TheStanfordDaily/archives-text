Editors Mole: The following is Stanford's response to
Suntn Clam County Supervisor foe Swiitian \ proposal
written Iry University President John Hennessy and re

I am disappointed thai, with less than a week left
in a two-year process, unprecedented new condi
tions have been interjected into the proposed Com
niunit\ Plan and General Use Permit lor Stanford
tli.it was adopted In the Santa Glara County Plan
ning Commission last I hursday.
Last night, Mr. Simitian said, "During the course ol
these past 1 «S months I have often heard or read the
suggestion that il Stanford I Diversity wants all this
development the\ should be obliged to give us the
open space in the foothills in exchange for that devel
opment. Let me just say, that's not the way it works. At
least, that's not the way it's supposed to work."
Unfortunately, the Supervisor's new condition
of "Compact Urban Development Commitment
(iredits" violates this very principle. This would re
quire Stanford to grant 99-year easements to the
(.(Hinty for 1,000 acres of loothills in exchange for

academic development for the next ten years. We
have been advised that this dedication requirement
is unlawful, and we believe it is unwarranted.
Alter exhaustive study, the County stall has con
cluded that the proposed Stanford development re
sults m no significant open space impacts. Stanford
has not proposed am development in the 2,100
acres in the foothills.
As both the independent environmental experts
who prepared the KIR and the County's own staff
have stated, no further mitigation is required. In
fact, concepts similar to the "Compact Urban De
velopment Credits" were considered and rejected
In the (lounty staff.
We hope that Supervisor Simitian's preliminary
thinking on this issue will (hange before the Board
of Supervisors' vote next week and he will embrace
the carefully t railed compromises contained in the
report adopted In the Planning ('.ommission.
The Stanford University trustees, under the

As to the first question, I have
already indicated that 1 believe
Stanlord I niversitv should be al
lowed to build all of the housing
for which it has requested ap
provals. Let me say it again — all
ol it.

i-l P. 1 "hat, I think, answers the
first question ....
Open space
During the course of these

past IS months 1 have often
heat (I or read the suggestion that
il Stanlord University wants all
this development they should be
obliged to give us the open space
in the Foothills in exchange for
that development.
Let me just say, that's not the
way it works. At least, that's not the
way it's supposed to work.
1 his isn't "Let's Make a Deal.'' It
isn't swap meet. And it isn't a Ilea
market. Nor is this an opportunity
to siniplv sav "stick 'em up!" We
can't do it, and 1 wouldn't even
suggest it.
What 1 can and would suggest,
however, is that we have not only
the right, but the obligation to exer
cise the land use authority ol the
County, t boughtlullv and judi
ciously, by applying appropriate
land use designations to the prop
erty in question, in both our (Gener
al Plan and /oiling ()rdinance.
We also have the right and the
obligation to ensure that any and
all adverse impacts in a land use
application are lull) mitigated In
the ( onditions ol'Approval.
And we have the right and the
obligation to require that a project
be well-planned, properly sited,
and carefully laid out to minimize
adverse impacts and maximize
qualit) of life lor campus residents
and the surrounding communities
I believe that the answer may be
found in the use and application of
"CI I) Commitment Credits" — a
system which would allow the de
velopment of academic facilities up
to the 2,OH"),000 square leet re
quested, provided that the com
mitment to stay clustered and
avoid sprawl was made manifest In
a commitment of acreage outside
the Academic Crowth Houndan
to long-term uses of a less intense
nature.

What I am inclined to suggest is
a formula that would allow an in
crement of 2,000 square leel of
academic development lor every
acre ol land outside the Academic
Growth Boundary lot which a
GUI) Gommitment Gredit is
earned.
1 he net result of such an ap
proach, should Stanford elect to
proceed with all 2,0.'J5,000 square
leel ol development, is that a little
more than 1.000 acres above 111-
nipero Sen a Boulevard would he
protected from sprawl lor a period
of 99 vears (or the life ol develop
ment, whichever was shorter).
Moreover, by carefully priori
tizing the acreage to he commit ted.
the Gounty can select acreage
above | unipcro Serr.i which is least
suited to development (Special
Gonservation Areas lor example),
an approach which should mini
mize the impact on both the Uni
versity and the public.
Development in the remaining
1,200 acres above |unipero Serra
would of course be limited b\ the
25 vear Academic Growl h Bound
ar\ and the General Plan's "()pen
Space-field Research" designa
tion ....
Other issues
Main members of the commu
nity, ol course, have also asked
that access to Stanford land, par
ticularly "the Dish," be a Condi
tion of Approval.
I do not believe that such access
can be required; but I would re
spec 1 11111 \ suggest to I niversit\ of
ficials here tonight, as I often have
in recent months, that a voluntary
oiler of community ac cess lor the

Unfortunately, the Supervisor's new condition

quire Stanford to grant 99-year easements to the

academic development for the next ten years. We
have been advised that this dedication requirement

has not proposed am development in the 2,100

As both the independent environmental experts
who prepared the KIR and the County's own staff
have stated, no further mitigation is required. In
fact, concepts similar to the "Compact Urban De

In the (lounty staff.
We hope that Supervisor Simitian's preliminary

Open space
During the course of these

past IS months 1 have often
heat (I or read the suggestion that
il Stanlord University wants all
this development they should be
obliged to give us the open space
in the Foothills in exchange for
that development.
Let me just say, that's not the
way it works. At least, that's not the
way it's supposed to work.
1 his isn't "Let's Make a Deal.'' It
isn't swap meet. And it isn't a Ilea
market. Nor is this an opportunity
to siniplv sav "stick 'em up!" We
can't do it, and 1 wouldn't even
suggest it.
What 1 can and would suggest,
however, is that we have not only
the right, but the obligation to exer
cise the land use authority ol the
County, t boughtlullv and judi
ciously, by applying appropriate
land use designations to the prop
erty in question, in both our (Gener
al Plan and /oiling ()rdinance.
We also have the right and the
obligation to ensure that any and
all adverse impacts in a land use
application are lull) mitigated In
the ( onditions ol'Approval.
And we have the right and the
obligation to require that a project
be well-planned, properly sited,
and carefully laid out to minimize
adverse impacts and maximize
qualit) of life lor campus residents
and the surrounding communities
I believe that the answer may be
found in the use and application of
"CI I) Commitment Credits" — a
system which would allow the de
velopment of academic facilities up
to the 2,OH"),000 square leet re
quested, provided that the com
mitment to stay clustered and
avoid sprawl was made manifest In
a commitment of acreage outside
the Academic Crowth Houndan
to long-term uses of a less intense
nature.

What I am inclined to suggest is
a formula that would allow an in
crement of 2,000 square leel of
academic development lor every
acre ol land outside the Academic
Growth Boundary lot which a
GUI) Gommitment Gredit is
earned.
1 he net result of such an ap
proach, should Stanford elect to
proceed with all 2,0.'J5,000 square
leel ol development, is that a little
more than 1.000 acres above 111-
nipero Sen a Boulevard would he

of 99 vears (or the life ol develop

Moreover, by carefully priori
tizing the acreage to he commit ted.
the Gounty can select acreage
above | unipcro Serr.i which is least
suited to development (Special
Gonservation Areas lor example),
an approach which should mini
mize the impact on both the Uni

Development in the remaining
1,200 acres above |unipero Serra
would of course be limited b\ the
25 vear Academic Growl h Bound

Space-field Research" designa

Other issues
Main members of the commu
nity, ol course, have also asked
that access to Stanford land, par
ticularly "the Dish," be a Condi
tion of Approval.
I do not believe that such access
can be required; but I would re

in recent months, that a voluntary
