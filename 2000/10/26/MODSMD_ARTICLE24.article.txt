## MARCIE'S MAGIC: Frosh Leads Cardinal Freshman forward Marcie Ward's play stellar from the start 
### ANTHONY LEE 
Stanford forward Marcie
Ward never gloats about her im
pressive accomplishments during
her freshman campaign.
"Everything 1 have" done this
year is because of my teammates
and the coaches," Ward said.
But don't mistake the fresh
man striker's modesty lor a lack of
intensity.
()n the soccer field, Ward is a
fierce competitor whose perfor
mance has spoken volumes.
Ward has sliced through op
posing defenses like cheddar
through a grater this season by
scoring nine goals and assisting
on 12 others to lead the Cardi
nal with SO points (third in the
Pacific 10 Conference).
Head coach Andy Nelson be
lieves that Ward's multidimen
sional ability to score goals and
create chances for her teammates
makes her a sensational player.
"Marcie is as good as any play
er in the Pac-10," Nelson said.
Nelson's high praise lor Ward
is not exaggerated but deserved.
Through the first 15 games ol
the year, Ward has nine goals,
which is second on the team to
sophomore forward Man ia Wal
lis's 10.
More impressively, however,
Ward has been Stanford's pre
miere playmaker — her 12 assists
lead the Pac-10.
"I don't always look to score
[goals]," said Ward, whose assist
tally is just one shy of Stanford's
single season assist record set by
U.S. Olympian Julie Foudy.
"When 1 realize that I don't have
a good opportunity to score, I
want to make scoring chances for
my teammates."
Her teammates are thankful
for Ward's passing ability. Ward
uses her deceptive strength to
control the ball over long dis
tances while utilizing her great
speed to break away from her op
ponents to create scoring
chances.
According to Wallis, Ward's ef
fective passing has enabled the
Cardinal's other forwards to have
prime opportunities to score.
"Marcie is great to work with
up top," Wallis said. "She is so ef
fective at utilizing the wide areas
of the field to hit great crosses."
Ward, on the other hand,
credits her teammates' great
plays and runs for her amazing
assist total.
The unselfishness on and off
of the field between Ward and
her teammates defines Ward and
the Cardinal team as a whole.

While on a recruiting trip to
Stanford last year, Ward saw a
chemist r) between the Cardinal
women that she saw nowhere
else, which greatly influenced her
to commit to Stanford.
Her initial instincts about the
Cardinal's unity were accurate.
Ward believes her teammates'
leadership helped her to over
come her frustrations when the

Cardinal went into a three-week
slump earlier this year tli.it saw
them lose heartbreaking games
to Washington and Wake Forest,
teams they had outplayed.
Her teammates "are under
standing of how I react to certain
situations," Ward said.
"1 hey know exactly what to
say when you are down and what
to say to pump you up, they know
how to get you lot used."
Ward leels that only recently
has she elevated her game to one
ol the top levels. I iowever,earlier
this summer Ward played as a
newcomer to the under-18 na
tional team.
Ward scored two game-win
ning goals while playing with
more experienced teammates on
the under-18 team, an experi

ence Nelson feels has helped
Ward this year.
Playing lor the under-18 team
"gave her a well-rounded experi
ence that has helped her flourish
this season," Nelson said.
Though surprised by her suc
cess this season, Ward never takes
her superb numbers lor granted,
lor she knows she can improve.
Nelson has been impressed bv

Ward's desire to learn Irom her
mistakes to elevate her skills.
Olten alter games, Ward will
ask Nelson what she could do to
improve her game.
"I am not going to get better il
I don't know what I am doing
wrong," Ward said.
Nelson believes that Ward's
determination and inner drive
make her a great competitor.
"She has a lot of expectations
of herself, and she is not happy to
be an average player; slu- wants to
be a central player on the team.
"She can si ill improve," Nel
son said. "She is going to be a
much better player when she is a
senior."
Dominant, and getting better
— a scary thought indeed for
(Cardinal opponents.
