### EZRA CALLAHAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There isn't much left that the No. 17 Stanford
women's volleyball team (1 1 -«S, 5-1) Pacific 10 Con
ference) can do to surprise anyone.
Heading into tonight's match against No. 5 Ari
zona (17-2, 10-1) at 7 p.m. in Maples Pavilion, any
thing short of having one of its players sponta
neously burst into Names on the court just wouldn't
qualify as unexpected.
I he (Cardinal has shown this season that it is fully
capable of heading out onto the court tonight and
shutting down the Wildcats' conference-leading of
fense and potentially pulling off a three-game upset.
Just as likely, it seems, Stanford's passing and hit
ting could be entirely off in the match, allowing Ari
zona to run away with an easy three game win.
"It seems all of our matches are on our side of the
court," said junior defensive specialist Kmily
Lawrence. "If we play well, we can take any team
out of its olfense and out of the game. If we don't,
then we take ourselves out of the game.'

happy t<> have Logan, but team
dynamics on the court on si ill

work together better."
The nights this season that
Stanford has (licked as a team
have clearly proven one thing: If
this team finds any sort of consis

tency, no one will be safe from the
C 'ardinal.
"I truly think that the players
all believe as the staff does that we
are a legitimate contender for the
national title," said interim head
coach Denise Oorlett.
"We're going to continue to
have that as our goal, and we're
not going to lower our standards
because we've struggled.
"When we get to the tourna
ment, other teams are not going
to want us in their bracket."
