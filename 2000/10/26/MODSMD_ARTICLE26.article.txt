# The 						Catch? Nothing compared to The Run and The Stop

### 
Lewis-to-McCullum
overshadows several
other football moments

Any number of observers will tell
you thai the play of the game in
Saturday's 32-30 victory over
Southern California was Mc-
Cullam's Miracle: the 20-yard Chris
Lewis rainbow that came down in Jamie
McCullam's arms as time expired to seal
the win.
But in my mind, those who tall that

i lie play of the game are
dead wrong.
Everyone loves a
bu/./.er-beater. It's all
the drama of sixty min
utes compressed into a
few seconds time: why
we love sports, the bite
sized edition. And any
number of Stanford
teams I've seen can loft

a game-winning pass intollie end zont
and have faith it'll come down right.
What made this game unique were the
two plays that made that drama possible

and those plays were both especially
memorable lot being so out-of-place in
Stanford Stadium. In my mind, the plays
oft he game were I lie Run and The Stop:
Kerry Carter's 20-yard touchdown
sweep and Riall Johnson's piling up of
USC. tailback Sultan McCullough in the
waning minutes of the game.
It's probably a good thing thai most of
the fans in the stands were not on the
sidelines when I he Run was called, be
cause most of us would simply have start
ed heading for the exits if we'd known.
With Stanford down 10 points and five
and a half minutes left in the game, Ty

rone Willingham found his drive stalled
at the USC 20-yard line. It had been a
nice drive, punctuated by third-down
conversions from both (larter and Randy
Fasani. But a couple passes came up
short, and suddenly it was fourth down
with two to go.
Coaching 101 is real clear on ibis
point: Down 10, late in the game, deep in
enemy territory and facing fourth down,
don't be the hero. Kick the field goal. I'ut
the points on the board. Then you're
down seven with five minutes left — no
problem to tie and send the game to () T.
If you go for it and miss, you've got noth

Sadlv. die "rules ' ol football
demand ih.it die other team get

thus the stage u.is set lor I he
Slop.
1 his is the point in the game at

Kealh . all it would ha\e taken

is one long pass. I he I rojan of

ford defense throughout I he sec -
ond half. ()ne long completion,
one breakawa\ rush across mid
lield, and time would have
ticked down too far lo mount a
game-winning drive from deep
in our own territory. I his is
Stanford football. I hat's what
happens in these situations. You
fall short once more, you go
home, cuddle \our Sears ( up
and wish in the hack oi your

Nebraska. Ii happens.
Kxcepi it didn't. What hap
pened was an incomplete p.iss, a
(i-yard Qb keeper — and Ihe
Slop. Mc(aillough took the hand
olf, the pile of linemen lurched
forward, and Riall Johnson plant
ed himsell and s.iid. "No fui tlier."
And when die dnsi cleared. ;i gap
of two yards gaped between the
ball and .1 lirsl clou 11.

What else could I S( coach
Paul Hacked have done? Hi'took
his shot, he tan his guv, and he
couldn't make it. Alter .ill. he had
run two minutes off the clock. All
he could do was hope lor a good
punt and hope his defense could
hold lor one last drive. It's what
anvone would have clone, dome
backs like that never really hap
pen. Maybe if you go to Florida
Slate, you count on them, but not
at Stanford.
Kxcepi ibis one did. Altei I lie-

plays like iliose again and again.
