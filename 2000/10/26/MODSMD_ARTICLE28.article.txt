field hockey team (8-9 overall, 4-2
Northern Pacific (Conference), how
ever, has one thing left to do: Beat
Cal.
flic last time the (Cardinal laced
California. in late September, the
game went into triple overtime and
came down to strokes. Kventnalh
junior goalie Rebecca Shapiro was
unable to prevent ( Cal Irom storing,
and the ( Cardinal It'll to its conlcr
ence rival.
I his time around, the Bears
should be reach to lace a fierce (Car
dinal squad out for revenge.
"We were disappointed that we
lost." s.iid sophomore (Christina
Williams, "but we knew we were
going to see them again."
I lie (Cardinal is coining oil lour
straight wins and lias looked
stronger and stronger everv lime it
lias taken the lie-Id. Ihe previous
(Cal game seems indicative ol some
of the problems the team was hav
ing earlier in tlu- season.
Alici a disappointing rc>ad trip to
the East (Coast earlier this month,
the (Cardinal returned struggling to
put the ball in the back ol the net.
I hiring the last lour vide >1 ies, the
ollense has seemed to come alive
and rallied lor 1 I goals Irom a wide
range ol plavers. Stanford is clearh
gathering momentum and peaking
at the exact moment teams aim lor
â€” the very beginning of the post
season.
"Kvcrvone is back healths now,
and our team is at full force." head
coac li Sliervl Johnson said.
Although the first game was a de
fensive stand-oil, the (Cardinal de
fense has a lew goals it feels will en
sure a Stanford vie ton .
"No defensive corners," sopho
more delensemen Tvsie Sawver

said.
I he defense li.is worked all sea
son on dem ing the < >pponcntsc leai
scoring opportunities such as cor
ners and will continue this effort on
Sundav. Sawver was confident that
tl the delense works on connec ting

I he dillerent fields .Hid lines of pla\
it will be successful.
I lie (iiu dinal will certainly be lo
nising on Sunda\ afternoon's
match at Cal, but ol equal signifi
cance is the rematch against the
I niversit\ of the 1 'at ili< this Satur
day aliernoon ai 1 I a.m. at Stan
lord. It will be the Cardinal's last
home game of the season, and se -
nior captain Michelle Scott's last
game at Stanli>rd.
Scott missed several games be
cause of an injun, bin the (Cardinal
is undefeated since her return. In
her absence, the team was able to see
how much they will miss their c ap
tain next year.
"Michelle has been a rock for
Stanford field hoc ke\ all four

years," johnson said.
Scott lias been a siarter since hei
freshman season ai Stanford, and
l< >111 years later Ihe team looks toiler
lor leadership and guidance. I his
sear's team is .111 extremely young
one. and Scott's guidance on and oil

the field is a key to success lor the
(lardinal.
"She controls the center of the
field and sets up almost all of Our
scoring opportunities," |ohnson
said. "She is a great leader, a very tal
ented athlete, and the heart and
soul ol this team."
.Although Scott plays her last
game on Stanford turf this Satur
day, her field hoc key career is lar
from done.
fhe team is counting on her to
lead n into an extremely successful
postseason.
" I lie team missed [Scott's] im
part while she was < >ut but now that
