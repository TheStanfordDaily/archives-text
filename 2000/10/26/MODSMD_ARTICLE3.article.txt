More Ihan 100 gold medals. Nearly 200 medals in

leaving its mark on Stanford?
Maybe so. The Bay Area Sports ()rgani/ing (Com
mittee. which lias several Stanlbrd-alHliated mem
bers, is bidding lor the opportunity to host the 2012
Summer Olympics. According to committee mem
bers, main premier events such as the opening and

The Avery Aquatic Center could host Olympic swimming events if the International Olympic Committee chose the Bay
Area as me location of the 201 2 Summer Olympics.
could lake place on the Stanford
campus.
"()ur relationship with Stanford
is very positive," said Helen Man
del, the committee's director of
marketing and development. Still.
Mendel is quick to caution that
plans are preliminary.
Bob Stiles, '70. the committee
chair who has directed three previ
ous ()lympi< bids, said the chances
of the Bay Area winning are good.
" There are [still] some things
that need to liill in place," he said.
If the Bay Area wins the bid. sev
eral athletic facilities may be up
graded for the occasion.
Stiles said the only place being
considered for the opening and
dosing ceremonies and the track
and field event is Stanford Stadi
um. I le said the renovation sc hed

ule has not been set.
If the stadium undergoes a ren
ovation, it will have more seating
and more press boxes. I lowever. il
the committee wins the bid and de
cides to rebuild the stadium, Stan
lord will temporarily receive a
world-class track, said Athletic Di
rector and committee member
Fed I.eland. I he track will be simi
lar to the removable one built lor
the Summer ()l\ mpics in Atlanta in
1996.
Leland said the stadium will ex
perience permanent changes even
il Stanlord does not play host to the
(iames.
I here are. however, many hur
dles to overcome before the light
ing of the ()l\ mpic torch at the sta
dium in 2012.
Hurdle number one: competi
tion. I he Bay Area is one ol eight
American cities vying to host the
games. Others cities include
Cincinnati, Dallas, Houston, Los
Angeles. New York City, l ampa

and Washington, I).C. .VII will sub
mit their bids this December. Inthe
tail <>l 2002, the United States
()lympic Committee will select one
ciiv to compete with cities from
around the world.
"Everybody in every city is very
serious about their bids," said Anne
Cribbs, the chief executive officer
of the committee.
Many consider Washington to
be the favorite. It is one of the few
national ( .tpit.il cities that has never
hosted the Olympics. However,
even if the I S( )C chooses the Bay
Area, the city will then compete
against cities in other countries,
file International Olympic Com
mittee will announce the winner in
the fall 0f2005.
"1 think [the Olympics] will
come to the I Jnited States in either
2012 or 2016, due i<> the influente
of NBC and American corpora
lions," she said. "Seven or eight of
the top II Olympic sponsors are
American sponsors."

The international competition
will likely include cities thai lost
their bids for the 2008 Olympics,
such as the finalists: Beijing;
Toronto; Osaka, Japan; and Istan
bul. Turkey.
But the Bay Area can claim sev
eral advantages. Silicon Valley
gives the Olympics technological
possibilities that other cities would
not have. Then there's the area's
weather.
"How would you like to run a
marathon in Houston?" ( ribbs
asked.
In addition, many possible
event sites have already been built,
rhe Pacific Bell Park in San Fran
cisco can be used for baseball, the
Network Associates Coliseum in
Oakland for basketball and the
Cow Palace for boxing.
Northern ('alifbrnia also has the
second-largest contingent of
Olympic athletes in the United
States.
"It's an exciting opportunity to

give Kxal residenis the ability (<>
compete locally," said Mark
Bruner, '79, a former ()lympian on
the executive board of the commit
tee, "It's tiin to compete in your
home town."
Hoard members noted that
their plan has a stronger locus on
environmental issues — an impor
tant issue lor all future (Mympics —
than any other.
Mark Jordan, a team leader of
the bid's environmental compo
nent, said the environmentalist!!
will be at the ibrelront of the dis
cussion. All new venues will be
green, and new technologies will
curb traffic problems, he said.
"Sydney did quite a good job
with the environment," Jordan
said. "We will do a much better
job."
Even if the Bay Area wins the
bid, it is not clear which Stanford
sites will be used. I he Avery Aquat
ic ('enter is one ola number of
swimming venues under consider

ation. The committee is also look
ing at two other sites. II the com
mittee decides to use Stanford's
swimming site, the aquatic center
will have to add another 1 .">.OOO to
17,000 seats.
"Right now, we're working with
architects to see how more tempo
rary seats can be brought in."

Diamond isa possibilitv lot soltball.
Stanford and tlie Ba\ Area
stand to reap enormous financial
benefits from a Ba\ Area ()l\ mpit s.
Mendel estimated the Olvmpics
would bring $7.5 billion to the lo< .il
economy.
Leland said a Ba\ Area
Olvmpics would be wonderful lor
Stanlbrd.
"It helps us renovate our facili
ties. make a small profit and gives
us a lot of visibility," he said. "And it
is also just really fun."
