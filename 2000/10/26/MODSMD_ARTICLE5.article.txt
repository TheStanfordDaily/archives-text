Do you know how to give the perfect hug? Stan
lord graduate and certified hug specialist Issac
Roth can leach you all the basics.
Junior Sain Richardson, a peer health educator,
said he invited Roth to treat Roble residents to a
hug workshop recenth . during which people could
relieve stress and get to know each other.
"My secret agenda is that people will learn some
thing about relationships in the workshop.' Roth
said. "They are related because even hug is a
micro-relationship in an instant.'
According to Roth, the workshop featured
demonstrations and opportunities to practice let h
niques. 'The class opened with a big group lutg lor
everyone to share in the love. Afterward, Roth dis
cussed the methods, tvpes and implicationsol hugs.
Roth said he wanted to pass along the knowledge
that would enable students to lincl and enrich the
three to six hugs a day that he recommends .is a
good baseline for life enjoyment. Alter all, he s.iid.
much evidence indicates that the human tout li pro
motes physical and mental health.
Student participation highlighted his points. In
one instance, Roth asked for two volunteers to
demonstrate a ling and ended up with two men.
"One began to ac t all cute and sheepish and the
other acted a bit like- a monkey, and thc\ come to
gether and hugged and then slapped each othet on
the way out of it." Roth said.
Roth thought the students were acting ac cording
to how they thought thev had to behave in front ol
