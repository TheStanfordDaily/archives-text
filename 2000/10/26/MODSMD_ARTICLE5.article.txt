Do you know how to give the perfect hug? Stan
lord graduate and certified hug specialist Issac
Roth can leach you all the basics.
Junior Sain Richardson, a peer health educator,
said he invited Roth to treat Roble residents to a
hug workshop recenth . during which people could
relieve stress and get to know each other.
"My secret agenda is that people will learn some
thing about relationships in the workshop.' Roth
said. "They are related because even hug is a
micro-relationship in an instant.'
According to Roth, the workshop featured
demonstrations and opportunities to practice let h
niques. 'The class opened with a big group lutg lor
everyone to share in the love. Afterward, Roth dis
cussed the methods, tvpes and implicationsol hugs.
Roth said he wanted to pass along the knowledge
that would enable students to lincl and enrich the
three to six hugs a day that he recommends .is a
good baseline for life enjoyment. Alter all, he s.iid.
much evidence indicates that the human tout li pro
motes physical and mental health.
Student participation highlighted his points. In
one instance, Roth asked for two volunteers to
demonstrate a ling and ended up with two men.
"One began to ac t all cute and sheepish and the
other acted a bit like- a monkey, and thc\ come to
gether and hugged and then slapped each othet on
the way out of it." Roth said.
Roth thought the students were acting ac cording
to how they thought thev had to behave in front ol
others.
"Why can't men hug each
other as themselves?" Roth said.
In another demonstration,
Roth experimented vviih the lim
its of comfort in hugging. A hug
progressed in intimacy until the
male volunteer voiced his dis
comfort.
Surprisingly, he said, the hug
ging lasted quite long and
evolved quite creatively belbre
the volunteer objected.
It was only when his breast was
being rubbed that the volunteer
felt compelled to end the hug,
Richardson said.
It seems then that the mascu
line aversion to hugging other
men is nourished by American
culture, Richardson suggested.
The culture discourages hugging

for men by emphasizing solidness
and individualism in behavior.
"Men are encouraged not to
express their emotions or feel
ings and not to express their
thoughts in any kind of physical
way," Roth said. "No one looks at
a man hugging someone and
thinks to themselves, 'Wow! That
guv is great at expressing him
self! He must really care about
that person.'"
Students said the workshop
gave them a chance to explore a
common expression of affection.
"The hug workshop teaches
hugging in a completely non-sen
sual manner," freshman Neil
Van ()s said.
"It portrays hugging as a
means of sharing 'packets of hap
piness' with a friend and learning
to feel comfortable with it."
Senior (lathy Ogawa said that
before the workshop, "I hadn't
really thought about how good it

feels to receive a hug.
"I think that hugging is essen
tial in our lives," ()gawa said.
Roth said he believes Stanford
students are respectful of others
and good at giving hugs.
"I know Stanford people al
ways want to improve even when
they're near perfect, so here's my
advice: Work on making your
hugging partner as comfortable
as you can," he said.
Roth's favorite part of the
workshop was giving men per
mission to hug each other.
1 here are still some people
who don't take hugging serious-
Iv, but Roth believes the work
shop was valuable for everyone.
"Kven if people don't take any
thing home from the workshop,
they still experienced lots of
human contact over a period of
around .SO minutes," he said. "I
know that makes a big difference
to some people."
