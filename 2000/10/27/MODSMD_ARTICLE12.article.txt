ed on a talk by current presidential candi
date Ralph Nader at Stanford.
"Social critic Ralph Nader lambasted
the legal profession Friday afternoon, as
an audience composed largely of law stu
dents crowded the physics tank to applaud
his criticisms.
"In a meeting arranged by the Law
Forum, Nader attacked lawyers for failing
'to meet their obligation to pay attention to
the integrity of the legal system. He also
blamed law schools for reinforcing the ex
isting structure by 'one of the most exquis
ite patterns of thought control at the grad
uate school level.'
"Changes are underway, Nader said
however, pointing to such steps as con
sumer poverty courses in law school and
pro bono work by established law firms.
I Ie said the legal profession is experienc
ing 'a real shake up.'
"Nader called the education students
get in most law schools 'a unilateral type of
process.'
"Kmphasis is on private and corporate
law. Professors usually have experience
only in corporate law first, he said. I his
emphasis leads to a 'decisive structuring ol
i lie profession,' Nader believes.
Bottom line: Thirty-one years later, guess who's
back on campus and kicking.
