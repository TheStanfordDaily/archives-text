## 
### 
|KRUSALEM (AP) — A Palestinian with a backpack of
explosives blew himself up yesterday as his bicycle reached the
concrete barrier of an Israeli army outpost, heightening fears
that Israel could face a renewed wave of bombings.
file militant group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility
for the attack by the 24-year-old in the Gaza Strip, the first
suicide bombing during a month of upheaval. Israel
responded In blocking the main road in (la/a with a tank
and hulldo/.ing trees that Palestinians could use for covet to
lire on the isolated base.
The diplomatic front appealed bleak, with Israel and the
Palestinians giving a cool response to President Clinton's pro
posal of Washington meetings aimed at ending the violence.
Street dashes broke out again in the West Bank and C »a/a, and
both sides maintained their hostile rhetoric.
"First of all the Palestinians must stop the violence," said
Danny Yatom, Prime Minister Ehud Barak's top adviser. "We
can't accept the violence as it is today."
Palestinian leaders said the I nitcd Stales could no longer be
the sole mediator, calling for the European Union, Russia and
others to join future talks.
A 14-year-old Palestinian boy died of a gunshot wound to
the head suffered two weeks earlier, but no deaths were
reported in Yesterdays c lashes. In four weeks of lighting, 129
people have been killed, all but a few of them Palestinians.
The suicide bombing pointed to an escalation in the conflic i
and added to Israeli concerns that a bombing campaign may
be unleashed following the Palestinians' release of 85 militants
from jail two weeks ago. The Palestinians say they have re
arrested 22 people.
"We've been warning that these kind of attacks were in the
works," said army spokesman Col. Raanan Gissin.
The bomber, identified as Nabil Araeer, pedaled his bicycle
to the Israeli post until he reached the massive concrete blocks
of the retaining wall. He then detonated several pounds of
explosives in his backpack, the- army said.
An Israeli soldier was lightly hurt in the blast at Caza's Gush
Katif |unction, where Palestinian rioters have clashed with
Israeli troops guarding Jewish settlers.
In nearby Ga/a City, hundreds of people desc ended on the
Araeer family home to offer condolences. Araeer's brother,
Yassin, described his brother as a devout Muslim who went to
the local mosque every day for pre-dawn prayers.
Araeer, who worked as a janitor at a kindergarten, was jailed

briefly by Ihe Israelis several years bark, bill was nol in detention
when the militants were Ireed two weeks ago, bis family said.
