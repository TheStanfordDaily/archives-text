MURMANSK, Russia (Al>) — Divers
who entered a sunken Russian nuclear
submarine found <1 note with the body of a
sailor who wrote 11 Kit 123 c rewmen survived
explosions that lipped through the vessel
and described their desperate plans to
escape, military ollicials said yesterday.
"None of us can get to the surface," read
the note found in the pocket of a seaman
identified as l.t. I)mitrv Kolesnikov, said Rus
sian Navy chief Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov.
It was the first sign that anyone Intel sur
vived the initial blasts ili.it tore apart the
submarine and sank it in the Barents Sea,
killing all 118 men aboard. And it again
raised the question of whether there might
have been any chance to save some of the
crew if Russia had not balked for days at
accepting foreign aid. I lit- note provided
no clues to the cause of the catastrophe.
"All the crew from the sixth, seventh
and eighth compartments went over to the
ninth. There are 23 people here. We made
this decision as a result of the accident,"
Kuroyedov quoted the note .is saying,
according to the I I AR-Tass news agency.
The note was written between 1:34 p.m.
and 3:15 p.m. local time Aug. 12, the dav of
tht' disaster, said Vice Adm. Mikhail Motsak.
chief of staff of the Northern Fleet, 112 oreign
and Russian ships in the area registered two
powerful explosions around 11:30 a.m.
The note "also said that two oi three
people might try to escape the submarine
through the emergent \ escape hatch locat
ed in the ninth compartment." Motsak said.
Water th.it gradualK flooded the ninth
compartment could have thwarted that
escape attempt, he said. After the Kursk
sank, Russian submersibles were unable to
latch onto the hatch, but Norwegian clivers
who followed managed .o open it a week
after the tragedy and determined that

there were no survivors.
"I am writing blindly," his note said,
and mentioned the figures IS and live,
without explanation, Kurovedov told fam
ilies of the crew gathered in the Antic port
ol Murmansk. The rest ol the note was pri
vate, Motsak said.
"I'm preparing fora meeting with
him," Kolesnikov's widow Olga, a
schoolteacher, said between sobs in a brief
Russian television interview from St.
Petersburg. "I want to see him again, I
want to read his letter."
The crewmen had some chance of get
ting out on their own through the escape
hatch but apparently didn't do that
because of injuries, Igor Spassky, head of
the Rubin design bureau that developed
the Kursk, said yesterday.
Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klehanov
quickly denied yesterdav that there was
any possibility they could be rescued.
Many Russian officials had said some
crew members could have remained alive
aftei the explosions, as indicated by
reports of tapping sounds detected from
the submarine in the first days.
But others discounted the reports as
unsubstantiated and said the sounds could
have been caused by collapsing equipment
or the submarine settling into the seabed.
The survivors ol the initial explosions,
which were minutes apart, probablv died ol
drowning, hvpothermia or high pressure.
Russian and Norwegian divers recov
ered the first bodies Wednesday afier five
days of painstaking work to cut holes in the
top of the submarine.
After the note was discovered, divers
concentrated on the ninth compartment
but were hampered by rough waters.
Divers ma\ cut a hole in th.it compartment
to facilitate the search, Motsak said.
