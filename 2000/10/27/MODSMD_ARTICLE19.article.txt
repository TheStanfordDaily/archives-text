## The 						Stanford Daily County should approve Stanford's proposal 
### 
Published Since IX9I

TJie Santa Clara County Board ol
Supervisors is set to review Stanford's
Ceneral Use Permit on luesday, and
County Supervisor |oe Siinitian has
announced that he will not approve the plan
without a guarantee of the preservation ol the
Foothills lor the next 99 years.
The University must be prepared to stand
its ground. Stanford's proposed plan is a
responsible one, and the county must recog
nize the positive record ol Stanford's develop
ment and the shortsightedness of Simitian's
appn >ach.
Stanford's willingness to grant total preser
vation of the Foothills for the next 25 years
demonstrates the I niversitv s commitment to
maintaining open space both for its own resi-

dents and for the community.
I hat promise is enough.
Stanford is not going to build in the
Foothills in the foreseeable future. But it is
too imu li to demand that the University base
its next 99 vears ol building policy on today's
priorities.
II we had made century-long predictions 25
vears ago, we would have posited neither the
Silicon Valle\ boom nor the housing crisis.
What makes the County so sure it can make
better predictions now?
I he flexibility of the previous (ieneral Use
Permit has allowed Stanford and the County
to reassess their priorities as conditions
change. I his policv should be extended so
that future changes can be met with

appropriate action.
Stanford's plan does not guarantee it the
right to build wherever it wants. Each indi
vidual building proposal will still come
under review by the county before it can go
into efleet. Just as it has over the past 40
years, Stanford will need to communicate
with its neighbors about its plans for
development.
The county gains nothing by rejecting the
plan in its entirety. If the plan passes, there is
still plenty of room to negotiate the details of
development.
Current conditions necessitate new build
ing. Skyrocketing real estate prices compel
Stanford to address the housing needs of its
affiliates. There is no telling how long this

trend will persist, but as long as it does, the
University must provide its occupants with
affordable homes. Unless the General Use
Permit is approved, the University will he
effectively frozen in its tracks, unable to meet
the needs of its community.
Simitian's proposal unnecessarily limits
present plans and future flexibility. 1 he Uni
versity and the surrounding communities
share a commitment to the preservation of
Stanford's natural resources. Stanford contin
ues to be a leader in environmental studies
and research and in setting aside its own lands
to further these aims. The County must step
down from its hard-line position and commit
to working with Stanford to foster responsible
development.
