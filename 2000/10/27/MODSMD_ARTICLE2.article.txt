# Pols consider abortion, High Court's future
## 
### KATE NAUNHEIM 
Presidential candidates Texas Gov. George W. Hush,
Vice President Al Gore and third-party candidates have
argued over many issues, and one of the most fervent
debates lias concerned abortion lights.
But a July Hotline-Bullseye Poll revealed that this
issue does not even rank in the top 15 that most pre
occupy voters. Education / schools comes in first, at
31 percent.
Voters might find it odd that the candidates are de
voting concern loan issue that does not seem very press
ing in this election, but the reason for their attention to
abortion is simple: 1 he next president will nominate
three or four new Supreme Court justices.
Currently, the Court is fixed at a six-to-three major
ity in favor of the lights proposed in Roe vs. Wade. But
if two justices opposed to abortion are named to the
bench, this six-to-three majority in favor of reproduc -

tive clroice would become a five-to-fbur majority in
dined toward obliterating reproductive choice.
The court is the underlying consideration inciting
much <>1 the deliberation, but other issues such as the
"morning-after" pill, Rl -486 and partial-birth abor
tions are cc|iiall\ weight v.
Democratic candidate (i<>re feels that abortion is im
moral but professes he will keep abortion legal; Repub
lican candidate Bush openlv opposes the procedure but
says he will not use abortion as a litmus test for justices;
Reform Part) candidate Pal Buchanan rails against
what he calls the deprax it\ of the procedure; and (ireen
Part) candidate Ralph Nader stresses that abortion
should remain a completeh personal choice for all
women.

Gore's stance
Farlier this year, Gore said, "I
have always supported Roe vs.
Wade. I have alwavs supported a
woman's right to c hoose."
Kut 111 a letter to a constituent in
1984. (lore said: "It is mv deep per
sonal conviction that abortion is
wrong. l.et me assure you that I
share vour belief that innocent
human lilc- must be protected, and I
have ,111 open mind about how to
further this goal."
Although these dillerences seem
irreconcilable, the reason lor the
llip-flop can be explained: A Demo
crat gaining entrance to the Senate
as a die-hard pro-lifer is not com
mon. In the House of Representa
tives, (lore consistently voted to bar
government funding of abortions.
Hut as a senator, lie voted live times
the other way.
All discrepancies aside, Gore's

stance coming into this election
echoes that of his predecessor. Like
President Kill Clinton, Gore be
lieves abortions should be "sale,
legal and rare."
Gore has said that he thinks it is
wrong to use the abortion issue as a
"litmus test" to screen potential
Supreme Court justices, hut he
states that it would be "very likelv"
that his appointees would uphold
Roe vs. Wade.

( a pill that induces abortion) reluc
tantly, commenting that he thinks
both pro-lite and pro-choice groups
"would like to see a reduction in the
number of abortions, and the way to
do that is to reduce the number ol
situations where women feel like
they have to make that choice."
Additionally, (lore says he would
sign legislation banning partial
birth or "late-term" abortions. I his
procedure would be illegal unless
the lilc of the mother were threat
ened or severeh at risk In having
the child.
I le also supports the Freedom of

Access to Clinic Knt ranees I .aw.

Main students are somewhat
perplexed by (lore's soli stance.
"I le is saying things contradicto

seems like no one's taking a strong
position on this issue in this elec

Bush's views
Kush is considered lobe the most
anti-abortion governor in the na
tion. He has consistently advocated
restrictive legislation loi the state ol
Texas, signing 10 separate bills re
llccting this p< >siu<>n.
Llection analysts sa\ Kush will
not be sliv in nominating anti-abor

Supreme Court a defense lawvci
from I louston who lias written what
many believe to be the most extreme
anti-abortion decision handed
down from one ol the ni< >st conserv -
ative courts in the country.
However, Kush has promiscd

not to screen judges lor certain
prelerenccs.
Kush stales, "Voters should as
sume that I have no litmus test on
that issue or am other issue. The
voters will know I II put competent
judges on the bench, people who
will sti i< 1 1\ interpret the Constitu
tion and will not use the bench to
write social polic\."
New York limes reportei Frank
Kruni asked Kush what he thought
a strict constructionist would sa\
about Roe \s. Wade. Kush respond
ed that ii "overstepped the constitu

Kush also savs that he would sign
a partial-birth abortion ban into
law, and states that the FDA ap
pr<>val of Rl -48(i is wrong. In addi
tion, he would also push a Parental
Notification Law wherein an\
minor girl planning to have an
abortion must have her doctor noti
