# Pols consider abortion, High Court's future
## 
### KATE NAUNHEIM 
Presidential candidates Texas Gov. George W. Hush,
Vice President Al Gore and third-party candidates have
argued over many issues, and one of the most fervent
debates lias concerned abortion lights.
But a July Hotline-Bullseye Poll revealed that this
issue does not even rank in the top 15 that most pre
occupy voters. Education / schools comes in first, at
31 percent.
Voters might find it odd that the candidates are de
voting concern loan issue that does not seem very press
ing in this election, but the reason for their attention to
abortion is simple: 1 he next president will nominate
three or four new Supreme Court justices.
Currently, the Court is fixed at a six-to-three major
ity in favor of the lights proposed in Roe vs. Wade. But
if two justices opposed to abortion are named to the
bench, this six-to-three majority in favor of reproduc -

tive clroice would become a five-to-fbur majority in
dined toward obliterating reproductive choice.
The court is the underlying consideration inciting
much <>1 the deliberation, but other issues such as the
"morning-after" pill, Rl -486 and partial-birth abor
tions are cc|iiall\ weight v.
Democratic candidate (i<>re feels that abortion is im
moral but professes he will keep abortion legal; Repub
lican candidate Bush openlv opposes the procedure but
says he will not use abortion as a litmus test for justices;
Reform Part) candidate Pal Buchanan rails against
what he calls the deprax it\ of the procedure; and (ireen
Part) candidate Ralph Nader stresses that abortion
should remain a completeh personal choice for all
women.
