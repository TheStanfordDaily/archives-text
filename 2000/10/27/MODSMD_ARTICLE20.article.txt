# SALAD DAYS
## The
						diamond revolution 
### 
Americans today arc working
their lingers to the bone.
Americans today are hunting
the midnight oil. Americans
today are putting their noses to the
grindstone in order to make inonex.
Then, Americans buy stuff. Ameri
cans buy lots of stuff. This column is
about one thing that Americans sink
gobs of money into. And it cuts through
our pocketbooks as readih .is it cuts

through glass ....
I was on a morning
grocery store trip to
stock up on granola
bars and Diet 7-1 p
when I heard a radio
advertisement that real
ly caught my attention.
1 here was no jingle.
There were no sound

effects. There was no
baritone radio announcer. Noi in tins
commercial.
An elderly man spoke softly:
" There are so main things in this lile
that we spend so much time and effort
on: our houses, our cars, our careers,
our wardrobe .... As I've gotten older,
I've had the opportunity to look at what
was really important in m\ life, and I
realized that it all comes down to one
word — love."
At this point, ol course, tears were
streaming down my face. Being the sensi
tive guv that I am, I alwavs get the sniffles
when I hear someone talking about love.
And, as a college student who has wit
nessed two entire years at Stanford ll\ past
at light speed, I realize that lile does
indeed go by very last. I think to myself
that I will be an old man someda\ and I
will look back on my lile and think about
what was really important.
Empathy hung t hit kin the.lit as I
awaited more ol the old man's words:
"My wife and I have been together for
52 years, and I've loved every moment of
it. I can still remember the night that start
ed .1 all
True love! The old man's about to give
away the secret of true love! I couldn't
believe my ears.
I le continued:
"It was the night that I gave her th.it
diamond. Man, I spent two months
salary on that thing, but it was worth it to
see the sparkle in her eyes when she
opened it. Her eyes still sparkle when
she looks at it, just like they did when
she was 20."
Bam! They hit me with the punchline.
My head had been lull of thoughts alxnit
true love (a c harac teristic ol someone who
has watched " The Princess Bride" as

m.m\ times as I have). Then they planted
a diamond right in the- middle of it all.
li was insidious. It was under-handed.
It was insulting. Ii was capitalism.
Yes, capitalism. I lie holy profit motive
is the lore e behind the- diamond industry.
I liev make the association in our heads:
Love equals diamond. And then they
reap the profits. Some ol the other steps
in the process include getting some
unfortunate souls to work in the diamond
mines. But the most important step is
keeping I hat strong love-equals-diamond
equation alive.
Ihe diamond is completely
entrenched in our culture, so the adver
tising work is just to maintain the status
quo. And the status quo is that women
show oil their big rocks and not love
poems written lor them (or other origi
nal, non-materialistic expressions of
allc'dion). But don't blame females — it's
.1 vicious eve le. Look at the men scroung
ing up two months salan to blow on a
diamond instead of setting aside two
hours to express theit love on a piece of
paper. It's quite .1 sparkling tautology:
Love equals diamond, and vice versa.
Diamonds are also used to settles dis
putes and mark anniversaries. Why talk
through a dillic nil problem when it could
be washed awa\ In the gift of some pre
cious stones? Similarly, what could be a
belter expression of love, possibly the best
thing in the entire universe, than .111 inan
imate object?
Something's gotta give.
Although I'm not getting married any
time soon, and I don't imagine that most
Stanford students have immediate plans
lot marriages or civil unions, the odds are
that it will happen to most of us someday.
Do the world and yourself a favor and
forgo the diamond, even il vou have gobs
of money to spend 011 it.
And don't buy flowers either. Go pic k
them. Paint your special someone a pic
ture. Write him or her a poem, <1 letter, a
song. Gonsicler a spec ial backt üb, a c an
dlelight dinner. A cute little- puppy. Keep
the profit motive and, hence, diamonds,
a thousand miles away from your love life
and you will be ,1 happier person.
Consider a line from my favorite
movie, mentioned earlier: "Nothing can
stop true love." And think of how the
executives at the diamond companies
laugh when they hear thai. When we buy
diamonds, we sell our souls.
I hrow those rocks into the hay. Start
I he revolution.
