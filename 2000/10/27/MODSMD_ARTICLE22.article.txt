Palo Alto resident welcomes
Simitian's proposal
l uesday night, |oe Simitian present
ed a very masterful compromise on the
issue of Stanford's exponential growth.
Nobody felt terrific about the propos
als, but nobody was completely c rest fall
en, either. 1 think that is a sign of a good
compromise.
All said and done, I believe Stanford's
development is too large and is happen
ing at too fast a pace, faking c are of hous
ing is crucial and I applaud Stanford's
willingness to address the issue. But the
other 2 million square feet of develop
ment over 10 years seems excessive and
will be difficult fin the community to
accommodate. I he 1,000 ac re set-aside in
the Foothills will be a partial mitigation for
this, and I thank Mr. Simitian for includ
ing this in the proposal.
I am grateful to the people and their
good works who have toiled lot so long to
protect our precious Foothills. I hope this
proposal signals at least a partial suc cess
for .ill and thai good-faith discussions will
commence.

Alum supports Simitian's compromise
I am writing to express my support of
Santa C lara County Supervisor |<>e Simi
tian's suggested compromise to allow for
the protection of some of the I <n>thills on
Stanford University land from
development.
I am a graduate of Stanford from the
( lass of 1995. As a native of the Bay Area,

I regret the continuous disappearance of
open space that 1 have witnessed
throughout my lifetime. 1 understand
thai development is inevitable, as many
people want to live in our beautiful part
of the country. However, 1 hope that our
elected leaders have the foresight to
understand that the natural beauty thai
exists in the Stanford Foothills is an
example of the region's biologic al vitality
that makes outs such an attractive place
to live.
As a Stanford University alumnus, a
native of the Bay Area and a frequent vis
itor to the Stanford campus, 1 urge the
Santa ( lata Gounty Supervisors Gage,
Alvarado, McHugh, Beall and Simitian to
support the compromise with Stanford
University that sets aside 1000 acres and
protects them from development for 99
years.
I hope they will take the lead in pre
serving a small piece of Northern Califor
nia habitat and set an example for sus
tainable enjoyment of our lands.

Alum responds to Hennessy's request for
support
An open letter to President Hennessy:
rhank you for writing today regarding
Stan ford's General Use Permit. It was nice
to finally hear from you on the matter.
From my perspective as a donor to the
I niversity, a runner and a local resident,
I have not felt very informed by Stanford
regarding its (Â«Ul\
Hui I was hopeful that this world-class
university would propose a solid, well

thought-out, environmentally responsible
plan. Once I realized that the new plan
included more building and paving of the
Farm, my school spirit was squelched
much like a salamander smashed under a
steamroller.
Hut when I saw your e-mail subject:
"Urgent Matter: Stanford Land Use," 1
was hopeful that you decided to involve us
alums on your plans lor the future of our
university. "Maybe now President Hen
nessy will explain why he paved over the
Dish trails in the name of conservation
biology," 1 mused. "Perhaps now he will
explain why armed guards in Ibur-wheel
drive trucks hunt down and interrogate
students who happen to wander oil the
Dish paths."
Instead of explaining the mysteries
presented above, you asked for my sup
port of your plan to continue paving the
Farm, li s hard for me to support a plan
which involves so many unanswered
questions. When you restricted Dish
access in the name of "conservation biolo
gy," 1 initially thought, "Wow, Stanford is
going to return the Dish to its natural
state, lint then I watched as you spent $4
million on armed guards and new roads.
I his does not look like conservation to
me, and I feel alienated and betrayed by
my alma mater.
I believe the University and its commu
nity would lx' better served under an
agreement for public access to its open
space and permanent open space
protection.
