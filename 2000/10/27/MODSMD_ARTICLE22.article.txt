Palo Alto resident welcomes
Simitian's proposal
l uesday night, |oe Simitian present
ed a very masterful compromise on the
issue of Stanford's exponential growth.
Nobody felt terrific about the propos
als, but nobody was completely c rest fall
en, either. 1 think that is a sign of a good
compromise.
All said and done, I believe Stanford's
development is too large and is happen
ing at too fast a pace, faking c are of hous
ing is crucial and I applaud Stanford's
willingness to address the issue. But the
other 2 million square feet of develop
ment over 10 years seems excessive and
will be difficult fin the community to
accommodate. I he 1,000 ac re set-aside in
the Foothills will be a partial mitigation for
this, and I thank Mr. Simitian for includ
ing this in the proposal.
I am grateful to the people and their
good works who have toiled lot so long to
protect our precious Foothills. I hope this
proposal signals at least a partial suc cess
for .ill and thai good-faith discussions will
commence.

Alum supports Simitian's compromise
I am writing to express my support of
Santa C lara County Supervisor |<>e Simi
tian's suggested compromise to allow for
the protection of some of the I <n>thills on
Stanford University land from
development.
I am a graduate of Stanford from the
( lass of 1995. As a native of the Bay Area,

I regret the continuous disappearance of
open space that 1 have witnessed
throughout my lifetime. 1 understand
thai development is inevitable, as many
people want to live in our beautiful part
of the country. However, 1 hope that our
elected leaders have the foresight to
understand that the natural beauty thai
exists in the Stanford Foothills is an
example of the region's biologic al vitality
that makes outs such an attractive place
to live.
As a Stanford University alumnus, a
native of the Bay Area and a frequent vis
itor to the Stanford campus, 1 urge the
Santa ( lata Gounty Supervisors Gage,
Alvarado, McHugh, Beall and Simitian to
support the compromise with Stanford
University that sets aside 1000 acres and
protects them from development for 99
years.
I hope they will take the lead in pre
serving a small piece of Northern Califor
nia habitat and set an example for sus
tainable enjoyment of our lands.

Alum responds to Hennessy's request for
support
An open letter to President Hennessy:
rhank you for writing today regarding
Stan ford's General Use Permit. It was nice
to finally hear from you on the matter.
From my perspective as a donor to the
I niversity, a runner and a local resident,
I have not felt very informed by Stanford
regarding its («Ul\
Hui I was hopeful that this world-class
university would propose a solid, well

thought-out, environmentally responsible
plan. Once I realized that the new plan
included more building and paving of the
Farm, my school spirit was squelched
much like a salamander smashed under a
steamroller.
Hut when I saw your e-mail subject:
"Urgent Matter: Stanford Land Use," 1
was hopeful that you decided to involve us
alums on your plans lor the future of our
university. "Maybe now President Hen
nessy will explain why he paved over the
Dish trails in the name of conservation
biology," 1 mused. "Perhaps now he will
explain why armed guards in Ibur-wheel
drive trucks hunt down and interrogate
students who happen to wander oil the
Dish paths."
Instead of explaining the mysteries
presented above, you asked for my sup
port of your plan to continue paving the
Farm, li s hard for me to support a plan
which involves so many unanswered
questions. When you restricted Dish
access in the name of "conservation biolo
gy," 1 initially thought, "Wow, Stanford is
going to return the Dish to its natural
state, lint then I watched as you spent $4
million on armed guards and new roads.
I his does not look like conservation to
me, and I feel alienated and betrayed by
my alma mater.
I believe the University and its commu
nity would lx' better served under an
agreement for public access to its open
space and permanent open space
protection.

Nader's Mem Aud speech gave
inaccurate picture
Mondav night, I laughed and
applauded along with the rest ol Mem
Aud .ts Ralph Nader poked fun at the
nivialit) and insubstantialitv of I'V news.
I cheered him on as he encouraged us lo
reclaim our legal ownership ol the radio
and television so that more informative
programming might take 1 he* place ol
toda) s lare.
So I was alarmed and disappointed
when Mr. Nader, when asked lo comment
on the current Arab-Israeli conflict, pre
sented .1 misleading and biased assessment
of the situation, one which could only
have been gleaned from the same insulli
c ient media coverage he had just
denounced.
Mr. Nader lamented that both on I V
and in the newspapers, "the first principle
in the newsroom operates — il it leads, ii
bleeds Kiel" (rather, il il bleeds, 11 leads).

and that the resulting gruesome stories
are often "\er\ superlic iallv covered, and
very tragic."
I he coverage ol violence in Israel has
certainlv been both tragic and extrcinelv
superficial. Though Mr. Nader's assertion
that the vast majority ol casualties in
Israel have been Palestinian (all but eight
out of over 120), these statistics cannot be
properlv understood without being
placed 111 context.
A typical encounter between Palestini
an rioters and the Israeli Delense force,
or IDF, involves a mob ol literalh thou
sands of Palestinians, most armed with
roc ks or Mololov cocktails and main with
guns, converging 011 an Israeli town being
protected b\ an 1 l)F outpost. Vastlv out
numbered, the 11)1 soldiers have no
choice but to use lethal Ibrcc in order lo
disperse the mob and, as they have the
benefit of cover, iliev typically do not sill
ier anv losses.
II 11)1 soldiers were simplv shooting
indiscriminalelv at essentiallv unarmed
Palestinians — if, as Nader claimed,
"the overwhelming military superiority
of Ihe Israeli army . . . started killing
Palestinians throwing rocks" — tens ol
thousands ol people would be dead, nol

111 st one hundred. Clearly, this is not
the case.
fhe IDF uses the most conservative
measures possible to break up mobs of
rioters, trv ing tear gas. rubber pellets and
shots fired into the air before, ii neces
sary. resorting to live lire. Furthermore,
Mr. Nader s c laim that .SO of those Pales
tinians dead are children is also true, but
certainlv through no fault of the IDF.
1 he Palestinian rioters consist primarily
ol children and young men and, what is
more, children are encouraged to move
to the Ironi of the group, where their
lives are most at risk.
What is blatantly untrue is Mr.
Nader's contention that the I DF has been
using tanks and helicopters to kill Pales
tinians. fhe IDF has used helicopters,
with one exception early in the conflict,
to lire only on strategic locations, not
people, warning their targets hours in
advance so that the) have been able to
evacuate each time.
As of the date on which 1 compose this
letter, tanks have lired only once, and
then only warning shots on the periphery
of a town which had beset a Jewish settle
ment with almost constant gunfire for
davs 011 end. fhe tanks are stationed not

to be used as oflensive weapons, l)iii to
provide a sense of security to the 1 1 >I- sol
diers. so that when presented with angn
mobs that great 1\ outnumbei thetn, the\
will not lire unnecessarily out of fear.
These tanks are saving Palestinian lives,
not taking thetn.
By disseminating incomplete and, in
some cases, spurious information, Mr.
Nader is perpetuating that which he so
ardentiv detests: the media's tendeni\ to
report bodv count without ba( kgtouncl, to
depict things in the most simplistic ,in<l
sensationalist terms.
1 do not deny that the violence in
Israel is a great tragedy, as are the num
bers of the dead. I have great empatln
for the plight ol the Palestinians and 1
believe firmly that a peace agreement
should and must be reached which will
provide the Palestinians with their own
state. I am, however, appalled In the
inadequacy of the commercial media's
coverage ol this issue and especialh In
Mr. Nader's failure to perceive the com
plicated realities obscured In this poor
coverage.

Alum supports Simitian's compromise
I am writing to express my support of
Santa C lara County Supervisor |<>e Simi
tian's suggested compromise to allow for
the protection of some of the I <n>thills on
Stanford University land from
development.
I am a graduate of Stanford from the
( lass of 1995. As a native of the Bay Area,

I regret the continuous disappearance of
open space that 1 have witnessed
throughout my lifetime. 1 understand
thai development is inevitable, as many
people want to live in our beautiful part
of the country. However, 1 hope that our
elected leaders have the foresight to
understand that the natural beauty thai
exists in the Stanford Foothills is an
example of the region's biologic al vitality
that makes outs such an attractive place
to live.
As a Stanford University alumnus, a
native of the Bay Area and a frequent vis
itor to the Stanford campus, 1 urge the
Santa ( lata Gounty Supervisors Gage,
Alvarado, McHugh, Beall and Simitian to
support the compromise with Stanford
University that sets aside 1000 acres and
protects them from development for 99
years.
I hope they will take the lead in pre
serving a small piece of Northern Califor
nia habitat and set an example for sus
tainable enjoyment of our lands.

An open letter to President Hennessy:

Hui I was hopeful that this world-class
university would propose a solid, well

thought-out, environmentally responsible
plan. Once I realized that the new plan
included more building and paving of the

much like a salamander smashed under a
steamroller.

Dish trails in the name of conservation
biology," 1 mused. "Perhaps now he will
explain why armed guards in Ibur-wheel
drive trucks hunt down and interrogate
students who happen to wander oil the
Dish paths."
Instead of explaining the mysteries
presented above, you asked for my sup
port of your plan to continue paving the
Farm, li s hard for me to support a plan
which involves so many unanswered
questions. When you restricted Dish
access in the name of "conservation biolo

going to return the Dish to its natural
state, lint then I watched as you spent $4
million on armed guards and new roads.
I his does not look like conservation to
me, and I feel alienated and betrayed by
my alma mater.
I believe the University and its commu

Nader's Mem Aud speech gave
inaccurate picture
Mondav night, I laughed and
applauded along with the rest ol Mem
Aud .ts Ralph Nader poked fun at the
nivialit) and insubstantialitv of I'V news.
I cheered him on as he encouraged us lo
reclaim our legal ownership ol the radio
and television so that more informative
programming might take 1 he* place ol
toda) s lare.
So I was alarmed and disappointed
when Mr. Nader, when asked lo comment
on the current Arab-Israeli conflict, pre
sented .1 misleading and biased assessment
of the situation, one which could only
have been gleaned from the same insulli
c ient media coverage he had just
denounced.
Mr. Nader lamented that both on I V
and in the newspapers, "the first principle
in the newsroom operates — il it leads, ii
bleeds Kiel" (rather, il il bleeds, 11 leads).

and that the resulting gruesome stories
are often "\er\ superlic iallv covered, and
very tragic."
I he coverage ol violence in Israel has
certainlv been both tragic and extrcinelv
superficial. Though Mr. Nader's assertion
that the vast majority ol casualties in
Israel have been Palestinian (all but eight
out of over 120), these statistics cannot be
properlv understood without being
placed 111 context.
A typical encounter between Palestini
an rioters and the Israeli Delense force,
or IDF, involves a mob ol literalh thou
sands of Palestinians, most armed with
roc ks or Mololov cocktails and main with
guns, converging 011 an Israeli town being
protected b\ an 1 l)F outpost. Vastlv out
numbered, the 11)1 soldiers have no
choice but to use lethal Ibrcc in order lo
disperse the mob and, as they have the
benefit of cover, iliev typically do not sill
ier anv losses.
II 11)1 soldiers were simplv shooting
indiscriminalelv at essentiallv unarmed
Palestinians — if, as Nader claimed,
"the overwhelming military superiority
of Ihe Israeli army . . . started killing
Palestinians throwing rocks" — tens ol
thousands ol people would be dead, nol

111 st one hundred. Clearly, this is not
the case.
fhe IDF uses the most conservative
measures possible to break up mobs of
rioters, trv ing tear gas. rubber pellets and
shots fired into the air before, ii neces
sary. resorting to live lire. Furthermore,
Mr. Nader s c laim that .SO of those Pales
tinians dead are children is also true, but
certainlv through no fault of the IDF.
1 he Palestinian rioters consist primarily
ol children and young men and, what is
more, children are encouraged to move
to the Ironi of the group, where their
lives are most at risk.
What is blatantly untrue is Mr.
Nader's contention that the I DF has been
using tanks and helicopters to kill Pales
tinians. fhe IDF has used helicopters,
with one exception early in the conflict,
to lire only on strategic locations, not
people, warning their targets hours in
advance so that the) have been able to
evacuate each time.
As of the date on which 1 compose this
letter, tanks have lired only once, and
then only warning shots on the periphery
of a town which had beset a Jewish settle
ment with almost constant gunfire for
davs 011 end. fhe tanks are stationed not

to be used as oflensive weapons, l)iii to
provide a sense of security to the 1 1 >I- sol
diers. so that when presented with angn
mobs that great 1\ outnumbei thetn, the\
will not lire unnecessarily out of fear.
These tanks are saving Palestinian lives,
not taking thetn.
By disseminating incomplete and, in
some cases, spurious information, Mr.
Nader is perpetuating that which he so
ardentiv detests: the media's tendeni\ to
report bodv count without ba( kgtouncl, to
depict things in the most simplistic ,in<l
sensationalist terms.
1 do not deny that the violence in
Israel is a great tragedy, as are the num
bers of the dead. I have great empatln
for the plight ol the Palestinians and 1
believe firmly that a peace agreement
should and must be reached which will
provide the Palestinians with their own
state. I am, however, appalled In the
inadequacy of the commercial media's
coverage ol this issue and especialh In
Mr. Nader's failure to perceive the com
plicated realities obscured In this poor
coverage.
