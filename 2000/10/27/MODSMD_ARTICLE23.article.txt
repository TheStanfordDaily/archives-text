# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Don't walk away: help the person who needs you now

No one expects screeching,

unforgiving, unyielding, horrilving crash
of a car and .1 bicycle.
Il would be better not to have to see

It would be easier to ignore the corpse

slopped, the scream of the driver as he
hinged out of his car towards the woman
on the ground.
It would be easier not to have been
there, because then we would not have
known the shock and terror.
We would not have stood there, in
timeless Iro/en frantic silence, as cars
sliced by, going the opposite \\.i\; and stu

dents walked through the quad; and still
others slept, unaware.

we do not know what to do; that we are

We are shocked and repulsed. We
don't want to see her bleeding next to the
c.u. huddled against the curb, her bod\

We don't want to see it, but we do. We
know what happened; she needs help.

you go. all of you who saw and heard the
t rash? Did you have class?
A housemate ol hers sprints over, tells
me to brace her neck while he looks at her
wounds. I do. I lie paramedics come.
Other people approach now, other peo
ple who tlitl not witness the t rash but see
the ensuing chaos. Thev want to help.

Oilers of cell phones. Oilers of jackets.
Why did you not offer?
Pay attention: You do not have to
know (IPR. You do not have to have a cell
phone or a jacket.
I hat stuff is extraneous, now.
At this instant, there is nothing more
important than getting out of our ego
centric worlds. There is nothing more
important than helping to protect this
woman's life.
I am incredulous, and saddened, that
von did not come over to help. Perhaps
von thought that someone else would
surclv take c are of it. Perhaps you looked
worriedly over your shoulder as you
hiked to the quad lor your 9 a.m. class or
to I residder to get in a full 45-minute
work out.
I do not understand.
We do not live in an insular world: We
are humans and mortal.
And we have a responsibility to our lei

low human beings. We were all liighl
ened this morning ai that intersection.
What matters is how we channel that fear.
Deny it, continue in your insular
worlds and hike to < lass.
Or acknowledge the fear, take a deep
breath and go over to her. Forget your
self. Ask instead, "What can I do lor ibis
human being, lor this stranger who needs
me and needs me now?" Stroke her hair,
tell her that she will be just fine. Love her.
Direct traffic away. Wait for the
paramedics. Steady the driver. |um care
enough to be there.
I hope you prayed for her.
I hope that next time you will have the
strength to stop — to give unselfish!) to
another human being who needs vou.
