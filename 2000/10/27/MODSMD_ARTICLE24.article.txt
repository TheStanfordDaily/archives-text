Students in Stanford's largest dormitories
are finding something interesting to talk about
over dinner this week.
For the hist several days, Stanford In Cov
erntnent, one of the I niversity's oldest and
largest student organizations, has been spon
soring dorm discussions on the upcoming
presidential election, one whit li promises to be
an extremely close race between candidates
Vice President Al (iore and I exas (low (leoi ge
W. Bush.
SIC i"s leadership got the idea to hold tlis< iin
sions from a resident assistant who contacted
the organization requesting that someone
come to her house and lalk about elet lions and
government.
"Stanford students on the whole don't feel
informed about the election, but the lact that
this sprang out of student interest is realh in
durative that Stanford students want to learn
more," s.iitl senior Courtney Carter, chair <>1
SIC public relations.

I lie RA's request spin red some thinking that
perhaps the whole campus could benefit from a
dialogue on democrats and choice. Carter
added.
So, this week. SI(. facilitators led healed elec
tion discussions in I reslunan Sophomore ( ol
lege, Wilbur flail, Lagunita Court, Roble Hall,
Stern 11 all and brainier I hill. 1 o give students
some background for the discussions, SIC also
put together an election guide which was dis
tributed in each of the dormitories.
"It's soi i of the t omplele guide to voting,"
Cartel said. "It's the candidates and the is
sues — a guide to who the) are and where
they stand."
Dist ussions in the dormitories have covered
topics ranging from education anil health can
to foreign policy and gun ( ontrol. dealing wnil
these questions on the national, stale and local
levels. At cording to C ai tcr, the tlist ussions ha\e
been lively and engaging.
|osh tried, a senior and an RAin Donner,
saitl of the discussion held in Siern. "Ii was a
great Ibrum lor people to share their views on

the issues .iiid the candidates." lie was disap
pointed. however, lhal Sl( i didn't advertise the
event more because only about l.> people —all
Donner residents— showed up at the hour
long discussion.
SKI has made the election discussions part of
a much larger program designed to inform and
educate students about the decision that they
w ill make on Nov. 7.
"Stanford In Government is on campus to
promote politic .il awareness, and we do that in a
variet) <>l \\a\s," (barter said. " I his is an election
\ ear. so out job li.is become even more ci itical.
Among the upcoming events is an election
