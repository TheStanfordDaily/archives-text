# New magazine on campus serves as creative outlet
## 
### TANYA AVILA 
Last spring an innovative and unique
literary publication hit student readers
across Stanford. Using design and art to
capture the essence ol its articles. Spire
magazine introduced Stanford to a new
style ol student publication.
Spire was founded last tall quarter
by sophomores Amit Kaushal and
Brian Larson, who lived together in
Larkin 11 all.
Both freshmen had been stall mem
bers ol their high school yearbooks and
lelt there was a lack in the variety of Stan
ford student publications.
"We wanted something more artistic.
So we decided to start up our own jour
nalistic magazine," Larson said.
After realizing the need fora student
publication focusing on visual images,
the two still needed to pick a locus.
"A class that I took fall quarter in
spired a lot of the magazine's direction,"
Larson said. "The seminar, 'The Arts
and Civic Dialogue,' explored art's role
in society and the artist's ability to identi
fy and discuss important issues. We at
tempted to create art that would act as a
catalyst for public dialogue about these
issues."
The development of Spire came in re
sponse to the "lack of art and design in
the Stanford community," according to
sophomore Arielle Reinstein, Spire's art
director. "After showing Brian m\ pic
tures, we talked about how there wasn't
an outlet for | photography! at Stan lord."

Larson also acknowledged the impor
tance of artistic expression through the
use of images.
" I lie graphic design and photogra
phy make the magazine more than just
a source of news, and hopefully a kind
of art," Larson said. "Our goal of the
magazine is to be edgy and cool and
provocative."
However, being hip is not the maga
zine's only focus.
"(The purpose! is to open people's
minds and [have thein| take a more
proactive stance [in political and social is
sues!," Reinstein said.
I lie editors chose the magazine's title
after discussing several ideas.
"We thought it was important to have
a catchy title, and we played around with
how [the different suggestions] looked
on a page," said Reinstein.
According to Larson, the creators
knew thev wanted a one-word title.
Someone said Spire during a brain
storming session and, after recognizing
that it was a suffix for many positive
words such as inspire and aspire, the
stall thought it was an appropriate fit for
the magazine's focus.
"It sounded and looked cool. It just
stuck, " Larson said.
During winter quarter, the team ex
panded In forming .111 editorial staff and
began the process of making t licit idea a
reality.
"Last vear was pretty crazy. We had to
figure everything out â€” how to build
and publish a magazine," Larson said.

"But in this chaotic process ol organiz
ing, adaptation and talking to adminis
trators and other publications, we
learned a tremendous amount. We
worked on publications in high school,
but in college, you're pretty much on
your own."
The founders used a brief application
to select their stall members.
Part of the challenge of publicizing
the new idea and recruiting new partici
pants was their lack of an example of the
magazine.
"One of our most difficult tasks was
trying to convey what exactly Spire is,"
Larson explained. "We didn't have a
product to show interested students, so
we did a lot of talking."
The next step of'production was the
search for funding and equipment. Ac
cording to Larson, $7,500 was spent on
publishing, photos and other produc
tion expenses.
Most of the magazine funding came
from ASSU Publications, which encour
ages students to create new public ations,
and Dean of Students Man Wais's New
Initiative Fund.
Due to tlie magazine's limited funds,
founders had trouble finding the appro
priate equipment with which to publish
the magazine.
"Everybody used their own cameras,
but the film was bought In the ASS I
Reinstein said.
1 he editors used the Vlever Library
graphic design stations last vear, but
they were usually crowded, according

to Larson.
After being kicked out each night at
dosing time, they would continue their
work in the I wain computer cluster.
"[We| stayed in there, night and day,
fora little under a week." Larson said.
"It was a very light crunch, and we had
some unexpected problems, but it
came together eventually. During our
stay in the cluster, we saw some beauti
ful sunrises."
When Spire was first released in June,
the magazine's stall lelt their work was a
great success.
"When the magazine came out, it was
ail amazing feeling for the staff. We
made this from scratch, from .1 vague
idea into a shiny and colorful magazine,"
Larson said. "All the work, arguments,
confusion and late nights were validated
with the tangible end product."
1 he Stanford student body gave posi
tive reviews of the new publication.
"We have received good responses
and some constructive feedback," Rein
stein said. "[Some suggested that we
could] work 011 organization, and that
the content didn't [always] llovv."
Wais, one of the primary administra
tive supporters ol the project comment
ed that, "The magazine was very well re
ceived. [Spire] was very creative, artistic,
opinionated and with good visual im
ages. [The magazine] was well written
,md a great success fora new publication
and I hope it continues to thrive."
Although Spire received positive
feedback from the Stanford campus, the

editors are si ill searching for funding for
the two 2001 issues.
According to Reinstein, this year's
Spire stall will call lor more business
stall, including a financial manager, in
order to raise lunds from the ASS I and
academic departments.
I lowever, advertisements mav he nec
essary as a last resort to put Spire in
print.
"A lot more ads for funding will
change the look of the magazine." Rein
stein said.
Despite the problems with funding,
Spire has grown to a staff,
plus freelance writers, and continues to
expand beyond the magazine.
"What I'm really excited about are
this year's new ideas to compliment the
magazine," Larson said. "We are plan
ning on coordinating on-campus
events that tie into the issues discussed
in the magazine. For example, we
might organize a panel discussion of
professors or screen a film and hold a
post-film discussion.
"We would also like to work with some
other student groups on campus and
join forces in our common goal to get
students to think and talk and act." he
added.
The staff is also in the process of build
ing an interactive Web site, where stu
dents will be able to access sound bites,
movie clubs, web links, photos and more
relating to the article's topic.
Spire will come out with new issues in
January and June.
