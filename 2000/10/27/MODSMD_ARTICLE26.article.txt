## Football gears up for Huskies 
### MATT LONG STAFF WRITER 
Bend, but don't break' is an
apt description of the Washington
I luskies' football style.
I he I luskies' season thus far
has been much more difficult than
their f>-l record and No. 9 rank
ing would suggest, as Washington
(3-1 Pacific 10 Conference) has
trailed in live ol their six wins and
won four games b\ a touchdown
or less. 1 his includes a dismal
showing against Cal last weekend,
when the Huskies won only
thanks to the Bears' offense gift
wrapping three turnovers (result
ing in 23 points).
Coming off a thrilling 32-30
last-second win over USC Satur
day, the Stanford football team
must linda way to tarry over its
momentum against a squad that
hasn't exactly instilled fear
through its performance this year.
But as unimpressive as the
Huskies have looked, the fact re

mains: They find a way lo win no
matter what happens.
"The personality of our team is
one where we feel ii out and all of
a sudden something happens that
ticks us oil and we go crazy," said
Iluskv coach Rick Neuheisel.
"I suallv il takes a spark, some sort
of big play. Unlbrtunately we are
seemingly having to wait until the
fourth quarter. But, if you are
going to pick a quarter vou want
to be good in, that would be the
one you'd pick."
Washington faces a Stanford
team that has seen two ol its three
wins come in the fourth quarter,
l he Cardinal's victor) over USC
c ame courtesy of a last-second
touchdown pass from redshirt
freshman Chris Lewis, who also
tossed a game-winner in Week
Three's comeback against Texas.
"I would believe that what the
USC ballgame showed was some
character, and 1 think anytime

Ryan Wells (6) and the rest of the Stanford football team won't have it easy
this weekend against Washington, the No. 9 team in the country.
I hat you can display c haracter it pro
vides you an opportunity to take it for
ward," said Stanford head coach Tyrone
Willingham.
To get past Washington, the Cardinal
must focus on containing agile senior
quarterback Marques l uiasosopo. Last
year Stanford suffered its lone Pac-10 loss
at the hands (and feet) ol Tuiasosopoby a
35-30 score, as the versatile 1 fusky threw
for 302 yards and ran for 207 more. Tu
iasosopo's performance marked the first
time in NCAA history that a player has
passed for more than 300 yards and ran
lor moer than 200 in a game.
The Huskies' bite has only gotten
stronger this season with the addition of
a fierce running game. Four Washington
tailbacks have reached the end /one this
year, and Neuheisel has found the "run
ning back by committee" approach to be
quite successful.
At the moment it seems a star has
emerged in Rich Alexis, a freshman tail

back who has overshadowed the older
players in recent weeks. Against Cal, he
started the game and rushed for two
touchdowns, solidifying his position as
the go-to ball carrier.
Then again, Washington could have
success with almost any runner, given
their huge ollensive line.
"1 think we've got to put just a few
more sacks of flour in our guys' uniforms
to see if we can give them a little more
weight," Willingham joked. "It does pose
a problem on a serious note. That means
oui\guys have to prepare for one of the
more physical contests that we'll have
during the season."
Washington presents a physical pres
ence on defense also. Junior nose tackle
Larry Tripplett leads the team with six
sacks and will look to add gimpy Stanford
quarterback Randy Fasani to his list of
victims. Fasani suffered a minor injury in
the final minute of the USC game, allow
ing for Lewis' last-minute heroics, but has
practiced all week in preparation for Sat
urday's showdown.
The Stanford offensive line will have to
keep Tripplett from pressuring Fasani in
order to make it through the game with

out aggravating his tender right knee.
If the rain in Palo Alto carries into the
weekend as forecasted, the conditions
might force Stanford to lean on its run
ning game, a rare occurance for an of
fense that hasn't had a great deal of suc
cess on the ground this year.
Sophomore Kerry Carter busted out
of the offense's rushing doldrums with an
impressive game last week, rushing fora
career-high 123 yards and scoring four
touchdowns. The loss sweep to Carter
has been the most potent running plav in
weeks past, and it's a good Ikm Stanford
offensive coordinator Kill Diedrick will
put the ball in the sophomore's hands
this week.
The Washington game holds a sense
of urgency for the Cardinal, as the team
needs to win three of its next four games
to reach the six-win plateau nec essan for
bowl eligibility. And with contests at
UCLA, at home against Arizona State
and at Cal for Big Came remaining,
squelching the Huskies' growl would
place Stanford in control of its own post
season destiny.
As long as the Cardinal finds a way to
bend and not break, that is.
