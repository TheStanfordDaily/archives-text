### EZRA CALLAHAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
All the No. 17 Stanford
women's volleyball team wanted
heading into last night's match
with No. 5 Arizona was to c ompete
with the Wilde atsand make a good
showing on the court.
lint after missing key opportu
nities to take control of the match,
it's hard lor the Cardinal squad
(11-9, j-7 Pacific 10 Conference) to
be satisfied with its 3-0 loss lo Ari
zona (18-2, 11-1), no matter how
well it competed with one of the
nation's strongest teams.
Stanford failed to convert on
game points in each of the first two
games, and the Wildcats took lull
advantage, lighting their way back
to steal both away. A discouraged
Cardinal squad then folded in the
third game, allowing Arizona to
easily finish oil the match.
"I'm proud of the way we
played in t lie first two games, but
we really just let up in the third
game," said senior middle bloc ker
|enniler Detmer. "We definitely
have a lapse when it conies to fin
ishing ott games. It's so frustrating
being so (lose to winning a game
<uhl then not winning it."
The first game saw large mo
mentum shifts as each team fought
to t.ike control of the match earlv.
Stanford used strong serving from
sophomores Logan l om and Ash
lex Ivy to throw oil the Wildcats
early, and the ('.animal was able to
run oil an early 9-2 lead.
1 lie Wildcats' defense came
alive, however, and Arizona scored
live points off blocks on its way to
tying the match at 11-11. lhe
teams deadlocked again at 13-13
before a kill by sophomore outside
hitter Michelle (lhambers gave the
(Cardinal a chance to close out the
match at 14-13.
But loin served the ball into the
net on the game point, and Arizona
c ame charging back after the side
out. I lie Wildcats scored the next
three points to win the game 10-14.
It looked like the lirst-game de

feat had gotten to the Cardinal
squad as Arizona ran off an early 5-
1 lead in game two. Interim head
coach Denise Corlett tried to shake
things up by sending in a couple of
freshmen, setter Anna Robinson
and middle blocker Jenn Harvey.
"I'm a coach who will try
things," Corlett said. "Harvey had
been playing well in practice, so we
put her and Anna in there to get
things going, and we started play
ing better."
Stanford rebounded to pull
even with the Wildcats at (»-(». The
teams would tie lour more times be
fore consecutive blocks by Detmer
put the Cardinal ahead at 14-12.
But again the Cardinal missed
its chance to finish off a win, with
the Wildcats forc ing a sideout on
game point and turning out four
straight points to steal the second
game lb-14.
Losing the second game
seemed to take the wind out of the
Cardinal's sails, and the Wildcats
ran away with the third game 15-5.
Arizona posted 25 kills to Stan
lord's I 1 in the final game.
Although several Stanford
starters did not look at their best
on the court in the match, Tom did
notch ,i match-high 1 ( .) kills and a
team-high nine digs. Detmer also
looked strong, hitting .(i 1 *) with 14
kills and a match-high eight blocks.
Stanford was helped by strong
performances off the bench.
Robinson had six blocks, including
live in the second game, and tallied
I'.) assists. 1 larvey added seven kills
to the Stanford attack.
"The freshmen came out and
did a great job," l om said. "Har
vey had some clutch bloc ks and
clutch kills, <incl Anna played real
ly well too. It's good to see them
contribute out there."
Arizona posted 75 kills for the
match while hitting at a .338 clip.
Four players posted double-digit
kills, led by senior Allison Napier
with 18.
I he Cardinal heads back to the
court tonight to take on Arizona
State at 7 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.

"1 hope (the Arizona) match can
help us mentally, but Arizona State
needs to be our focus," Corlett
said. "Arizona would have been
nice to win, but now we have a
stretch of games that we simply
have to win."
It's impossible to talk about Ari
zona State without talking about
Amanda Burbridge. l he senior
outside hitter was named Pac-10

Player of the Week and the AVCA
National Player of the Week alter
posting an unbelievable 77 kills
and -47 digs in the Sun Devils' wins
over Washington and Washington
State List weekend.
Stanford will be looking to
make up fora poor showing
against the Sun Devils last month
in Tempe, when Arizona State de
leated the Cardinal 3-1.
