## 
### ALEX BENJAMIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With ilie- regular season nearing its end, the No. 2
Stanford men's soccer team is t.iking care ol business
just about everywhere. After eight straight games in the
c<mimes <)f New Maloney Field, that Ihe (lardinal would
lace problems on its live-game road trip. Just like the
rest oi the season so iar, however, Stanford lias refused
to lose on road swing.
Already Stanford (13-1 -1, 4-1-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) has taken the first two games in typical fashion,
beating Oregon State last Friday 2-1 and No. 12 Wash
ington on Sundav 2-0 to earn at ie for first in I lie Pac-10.
I his weekend the Cardinal will look to continue its
live-game winning streak and remain at the lop ol the
conference as the team heads across the bay to battle
with California (4-0-1), in a place not known for its
warm welcomes.
In the first meeting ol the season between the two
teams, Stanford came out on top !>-0, but with only little
satisfaction. Facing a team that had lost numerous play
ers lo graduation, the C lardinal expected the game to be
one of its easier matt lies, but (..il was not willing to give
in. For the first half of the game it looked even, but in
the second half Stanford stepped up the level ol play
and came out with three unanswered goals to put the
game away.
I his time around, the game will only be more diffi
cult. Besides coining into Sunday s game with the expe
rience of the first contest, Cal will also have a bit ol mo
mentum after upsetting No. 0 UCLA I -0 on I riday.
"It's another league game, which means it takes on

Rust. "Cal is also a game that we should win, but these
are the games that we have to put away early and with
authority. II we give them any light i»t all, they will be

Every time Stanford and Cal meet on the soccer pitch, it's always a fierce
battle, as the Cardinal's Ryan Nelsen can attest.
Cardinal now holds the top spol in a
number of NCAA Division 1 team siatis
tics. By allowing only four goals in 15
games, senior goalkeeper Adam Zapala
and the rest of the defense lias given Stan
lord a national best .26 goals-against av
erage as well as the top shutout percent
age by blanking opponents 12 times in l. r >
games.
()n the offensive side of the ball, Stan
ford has also been getting the job done.
()uiscoring opponents 19-4 has given the
Cardinal the third most productive of
fense in the country at .'i.27 goals per
game, propelling the team to the second
best winning percentage in the nation.
On an individual note, the Cardinal
has also had a number of players honored
ibis season. Seniors Lee Morrison, Luke
Rust «ind Sean S\ Ivis as well as sophomore
Roger Lcvesque have all been named to
Soccer America's 1 earn of the Week at
different points in the season. This week,
Svlvis's game-winning goals in each of the

lasi two matches made him the first Stan
lord player to he named Pac-J() Player of
the Week.
Despite all of its success, the team is still
in search of a No. 1 ranking, which might
just be the onh thing that the Cardinal has
fallen short of this season — at least so far.
" 1 he team believes that we are the
best in the nation," said Sylvis. "But we
will continue to have to prove it to those
who have not seen us play and do not be
lieve. l he upcoming game against [No.
I | Indiana is one chance to prove to our
selves <md to everyone else the we are
the best."
Rankings, though, are not the most
important aspect of the game. Stanford
head coach Bobby Clark trusts in the
team that he lias under him.
"1 feel the strength of this current
Stanford team is their teamwork," Clark
said. "This group is a very hardworking,
highly motivated group. They put the
team first and themselves second. They
work Ibr each other and totally buy into
the system. Thev know that the sum of all
the parts when working together, adds
up to more than the total. We are truly an
energized group."
