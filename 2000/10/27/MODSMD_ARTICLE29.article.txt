# Double whammy in SoCal: USC, UCLA await Card
## Women’s soccer faces tough test against No. 8 Bruins, No. 13 Trojans in Los Angeles 
### WENDI WHITMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 18 Stanford women's soccer
team will prepare for this weekend's
games against two top-25 opponents just
as it always does in practice.
The players will line up in practice to
play the crossing game, a challenge
where the field players and head coach
Andy Nelson must st ore five goals out of
20 tries on the goalkeepers. The loser of
the game (either the field players or the
goalkeepers) must then survive the hu
miliation and pain of a round of butts up
courtesy of the winners.
"It's just one tradition that will never
die. I guess it's something that we always
do and will keep doing," said fifth year se
nior and co-captain Shauna Itri.
Long-standing tradition and Cardinal
pride. These are what diflerentiates Stan
ford from all other schools. Nothing em
bodies these qualities better than the
women's soccer team, a symbol of consis
tency and excellence.
With last weekend's convincing Pacific
10 Conference wins over Arizona and
Arizona State, this year's team continued
an impressive streak of 1H consecutive
seasons with ten wins or more.
That's pretty good, especially when
vou consider that this year Nelson, Stan

lord's brand new head coach, si.iris seven
underclassmen — a combination of
freshman and sophomores — all ol
whom have been learning the impor
tance of this tradition on tlie job.
"We have a lot of young players this
year, which is sometimes tough, because
they are learning a lot about what it
means to be a part of this team and to rep
resent this school as we go along, Itri
said.
As Stanford enters another weekend
of difficult play in the Pac-10, the Cardi
nal tradition will be challenged by two
conference foes this weekend in No.B
UCIaA and No. 13 USC. The road trip to
Los Angeles will provide the Cardinal
with a still test of how they compare to
these nationally ranked teams.
"Every time we put on that Stanford
jersey, it means something," said senior
co-captain Christy La Pierre. "Because we
are the defending conference champi
ons, every team seems to go a little hard
er against us."
Friday night's match against UCLA
will test Stanford's ability to play with a
team that employs a very similar style to
its own. IJCIA has out scored opponents
48-") this year and displays a pressing
style ol play.
"\\'e have been working on playing
against a flat-back four [t'CLA's defen
sive formation], being patient in the at
tack and being able to attack from our
wide players," Nelson said.
Stanford will have to stop UCLA's
leading scorer, senior forward
Tracy Milburn, who has 12 goals
this season. UCLA touts a well
rounded offensive corps includ
ing freshman forward Sarah
Cayle-Swanson, who is second in
scoring to Milburn. Junior goal
keeper CiCi Peterson leads the
stout defense, recording 10
shutouts on the year with a 0.3(>
goals-against average.
Last year, the Cardinal feasted
on Bruin miscues at New Mal
oney Field and cruised to a 4-0
victory,, an essential win in last
year's run to the conference
championship. This year, the
tides have tut tied as UCLA seems
to have a more legitimate shot at
catching both conference leader
Washington and l'ac-10 second

place California than Stanford
does. I his lact does not lessen tlie
significance of Friday's game, as
Stanford needs victories in order
to assure a post-season birth.
"A win against UCLA would be
pretty big time for us in terms of
both the conference and tourna
ment seeds," said senior goal
keeper Carly Smolak.
On Sunday afternoon, Stan
ford hopes to ruin USC's Senior
Day as the Cardinal and the Tro
jans will do battle at 1 p.m. in Los
Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
USC. is currently tied with UCLA
for third in the conference stand
ings and will be playing with a lit
tle extra emotion in tlicit last teg
ular season home game.
The Trojans use a physical
style of play to assert dominance
over opponents. USC is led by
freshman forward Jessica Ld
wards, who has eight goals and
four assists this season. Midfield
ers Isabelle Harvey and All Fen-

Nell are also scoring threats as
they each have live goals under
their bells on the season. Stanford
overcame the Trojans last year
with a dramatic 3-2 victory.
I he Cardinal will counter on
both the olfensive and defensive
side of the ball with two players
who are currently making their
own histories here on the Farm.
Freshman forward Marcie Ward
currently leads the Pat 10 in as
sists and ranks eighth in the na
tion with 1U total on the year.
On defense, Smolak has been
a rock for the young Cardinal de
fense touting a 0.85 goals against
average. With her career-and
Stanford-best 81 saves on the
season, she ranks second on the
all-time saves list with 215 for her
career.
The Cardinal hopes that the
rest of the team, led by the
strength of these two players, will
come out on top in both of its
matches this weekend.

tle extra emotion in tlicit last teg
ular season home game.
The Trojans use a physical
style of play to assert dominance
over opponents. USC is led by
freshman forward Jessica Ld
wards, who has eight goals and
four assists this season. Midfield
ers Isabelle Harvey and All Fen-

Nell are also scoring threats as
they each have live goals under
their bells on the season. Stanford
overcame the Trojans last year
with a dramatic 3-2 victory.
I he Cardinal will counter on
both the olfensive and defensive
side of the ball with two players
who are currently making their
own histories here on the Farm.
Freshman forward Marcie Ward
currently leads the Pat 10 in as
sists and ranks eighth in the na
tion with 1U total on the year.
On defense, Smolak has been
a rock for the young Cardinal de
fense touting a 0.85 goals against
average. With her career-and
Stanford-best 81 saves on the
season, she ranks second on the
all-time saves list with 215 for her
career.
The Cardinal hopes that the
rest of the team, led by the
strength of these two players, will
come out on top in both of its
matches this weekend.


Kelsey Carlson,

player, will have
her hands full
with tough USC
and UCLA
squads.
