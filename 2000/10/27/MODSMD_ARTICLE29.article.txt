# Double whammy in SoCal: USC, UCLA await Card
## Women’s soccer faces tough test against No. 8 Bruins, No. 13 Trojans in Los Angeles 
### WENDI WHITMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 18 Stanford women's soccer
team will prepare for this weekend's
games against two top-25 opponents just
as it always does in practice.
The players will line up in practice to
play the crossing game, a challenge
where the field players and head coach
Andy Nelson must st ore five goals out of
20 tries on the goalkeepers. The loser of
the game (either the field players or the
goalkeepers) must then survive the hu
miliation and pain of a round of butts up
courtesy of the winners.
"It's just one tradition that will never
die. I guess it's something that we always
do and will keep doing," said fifth year se
nior and co-captain Shauna Itri.
Long-standing tradition and Cardinal
pride. These are what diflerentiates Stan
ford from all other schools. Nothing em
bodies these qualities better than the
women's soccer team, a symbol of consis
tency and excellence.
With last weekend's convincing Pacific
10 Conference wins over Arizona and
Arizona State, this year's team continued
an impressive streak of 1H consecutive
seasons with ten wins or more.
That's pretty good, especially when
vou consider that this year Nelson, Stan

lord's brand new head coach, si.iris seven
underclassmen — a combination of
freshman and sophomores — all ol
whom have been learning the impor
tance of this tradition on tlie job.
"We have a lot of young players this
year, which is sometimes tough, because
they are learning a lot about what it
means to be a part of this team and to rep
resent this school as we go along, Itri
said.
As Stanford enters another weekend
of difficult play in the Pac-10, the Cardi
nal tradition will be challenged by two
conference foes this weekend in No.B
UCIaA and No. 13 USC. The road trip to
Los Angeles will provide the Cardinal
with a still test of how they compare to
these nationally ranked teams.
"Every time we put on that Stanford
jersey, it means something," said senior
co-captain Christy La Pierre. "Because we
are the defending conference champi
ons, every team seems to go a little hard
er against us."
Friday night's match against UCLA
will test Stanford's ability to play with a
team that employs a very similar style to
its own. IJCIA has out scored opponents
48-") this year and displays a pressing
style ol play.
"\\'e have been working on playing
against a flat-back four [t'CLA's defen
sive formation], being patient in the at
tack and being able to attack from our
wide players," Nelson said.
Stanford will have to stop UCLA's
