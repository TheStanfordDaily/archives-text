the Stanford versus Washington game, complete with
a tailgate."

"The SIAM! event showed me that diversity is cel
ebrated at Stanford and that if this event was taking
place, there is an ellort being made
here (at t he* very least) to make
Stanford a more comfortable place
for minorities," Rice said.
