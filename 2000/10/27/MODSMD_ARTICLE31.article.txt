### BEN ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When the learns ol the Pacific
10 Conference loe ihe line in
Seal lie loinorrow for the Pac-10
( loss Country Championship
rate, there will Ik- one group of
men whose destiny .is champions
seems predetermined.
And of those eight squads
(I SC and Oregon State will not
compete), its likeh that only that
same seeming!) predestined
group — third-ranked
Stanford — is looking at the meet
as a "learning experience," a step
ping stone toward its much larger
goal of an \( A\(hampionship.
"Kadi week, we're trying to
learn something new about the
personalis of our learn and the
dynamics thai are going to best
match up with what we have to
do ai the NCAYs." said Stanford
head coach Vin Lananna. "Pac
10s is one more step."
I his week, Lananna sends just
Iwo seniors— I honias Murlev
,md |onathon Rile\ —lo lead a
group ol freshmen and sopho
mores over ihe 8-kilometer
course in Seattle's Lincoln Park.
Sophomores Selll I lejm and
Anch Powell will join freshman
Donald Sage and redshirt fresh
men Louis Luchini and Crant
R<>hison lo lill out the S(|iiad.
With a voting team with as
mm li raw speed and talent as
you'd find pent up behind the
starting gates ai the Kentucky
Derbv, Lananna plans to let the
reins loose and wait li his (Cardi
nal pat l\ lest ils limits.
"We are going lo run aggres
sively," Lananna said. "We real
l\ want .i small differential be
tween our lirst and seventh
men, and I iliink iliis is our l)esi
lineup to do it."

What Lxinanna doesn'i want
are any surprises. Lasi Near ai
Long Beach, I hen-No. 2 Stanford
went out tcx)conservatively at the
Pac-10 race and was eaten up b\
the No. 5 Arizona Wildcats, who
placed six runners in the top I I.
"Our guys are excited,
Lananna said. "That's some ol
the fun of having a youthful
team. That anticipation is always
reallv good, but ct mlidence is also
important. I hat's win we re
putting together such a strong
team. It's one thing to think
you're really good, but it's anoth
er thing to know you're really
good."
Not that putting together the
squad was an easy task. Lananna
and coach Michael Reilly had to
choose among a large pool ol tal
ent, including runners like red
shirt freshman Andrew llill and
sophomore Daniel Parris. who
have proven themselves in races
throughout the year.
Lveii Olympians Michael
Stember. a senior, and (iabejen
nings, a junior, both of whom
raced Pac-10s last year, will not
suit up lor Stanford.
Lananna indicated ilia) the
two will decide soon whether to
run c ross country for the (Cardi
nal this year or take the quarter
of]'from racing.
"Cabe's got to make his dec i
sion, and I'm sure he'll make it
this week. As lor Michael, lie
needs a break. Whether he takes
that break now or three weeks
from now [after the Nov. 20
N( I.AA meet |, we'll have to see."
Lananna plans to tinker with
the lineup again at the Nov. 1 I
Regional meet and sa\s he won't
know what his final top seven will
be until the NCAA meet.
I he men's race tomorrow be
gins at 12:15 p.m.
