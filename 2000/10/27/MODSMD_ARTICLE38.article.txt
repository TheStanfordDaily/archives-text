## Ralph Nader comes to the Bay Area to discuss politics in the face of corporate America 
### PETER STAIR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Editor's Note: Phis article examines
the groining trend of progressive ac
tivism on college cam puses'throughout
the country. Ralph Nader embodies the
increasing presence of this type of po
litical awareness among young people.
Intermission ashed a Nader insider,
Stanford junior Peter Stair, to give a
first-hand account of the substance be
hind the Nader phenomenon. Peter is
currently an intent for the Nader
2000 campaign's D.C. press office.

l<S-to-24 age group often labeled
as poltically apathetic, and per
haps Nader's most famous catch
phrase has become a salient warn
ing during this year's electoral
campaigning: "11 you don't get
turned on to politics, politics will
turn on you."
With Nader's help, a move
ment criticized as hodge-podge
and even hypocritical is coming
together. The unifying concern
of the anarchist, socialist, envi
ronmentalist and labor union
protesters is well-articulated in
Nader's message: "Multinational
corporations are a threat to
democracy that no longer serve in
the public interest."
As a result of this ever-growing
base of youth support, Nader is
helping to build an environmen
talist / labor union, "blue-green"
coalition into a genuine progres
sive movement. The timing of
such a movement is ripe: those in
attendance in Oakland last Satur
day were energized with the hope
of long due political change.
At the super-rally, more aptly
described as a political rock con
cert, the audience of over 7,000
heard from a myriad of speakers
including Senate candidate
Medea Benjamin, Harvard Pro
lessor Cornel West, former Dean

"Welcome to the politics of joy
and justice."
It is a salutation Ralph Nader
lias repeated throughout his c am
paign for president, and it was the
message of his speech before an
overflow crowd at Oakland's
Kaiser Arena last Saturday night.
The audience, largely made up of
young activists and first-time vot
ers, has helped create a new gen
eration of politically conscious
men and women who constitute a
growing wedge of vocal citizens,
especially on college campuses
like Stanford.
Nader's stance is one that does
not ignore issues important to the

Kennedys hand member Jello Ui
afra, cartoonist Tom Tomorrow
who actually acted out a car
toon featuring his character
"Sparky" â€” and singer Patti
Smith.
It was the eighth super-rally in

an eclectic and irreverent political
campaign. The Nader catnp, part
ol the growing progressive politi
cal movement across the country,
has featured a controversial take
off of a MasterCard advertise
ment ["Grilled tenderloin for
fund-raiser, $1000 a plate. Cam
paign ads filled with half-truths,
$10 million. Promises to special
interest groups, over $1(1 billion.

Finding out the truth, priceless."]
Supporters wearing chicken
suits and duck suits have shown
up at gatherings lor Gore and
Bush, asking, respectively, "Why
are you afraid of debating Ralph
Nader?" and "Why are you duck-

ing the important issues?" The
campaign has paid for three
"clean up politics" van tours, dri
ving around Southern and Mid-
Western st.ites embarrassing local
officials and handing out bars ol
soap. And Nader's supporters
range from Noam C.hompsky to
I'llil Donahue to Kddie Vedder.
Yet despite the campaign's ir
reverence, its "joy" is often some

what restrained. The moocl in
Oakland was a combination of
weariness and tentative excite
ment. When supporters left the
rally Saturday, they returned to a
world they perceived as hostile.
They believe our democracy has
been hijacked by powerful corpo
rations so effectively that our next
president will be more receptive
to C'.K( )s than citizens.
In the last two decades, they've
seen ihe wage of the average
worker decline, global warming
become a reality and repeated ef
forts at reform tail. Musician Patti
Smith told rally attendees, "My
spiritual heart is broken. My envi
ronmentalist heart is broken. But
it's on the mend. Its not gonna be
easy, but here we come." Then
she sang a haunting rendition ol
"Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"
which served as an apt demon
stration of how this new breed of
leftist citizens will not stop until
they have attained their dreams
of political change.
