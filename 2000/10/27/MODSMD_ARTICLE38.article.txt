# Green Party ignites campus activism
## Ralph Nader comes to the Bay Area to discuss politics in the face of corporate America 
### PETER STAIR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Editor's Note: Phis article examines
the groining trend of progressive ac
tivism on college cam puses'throughout
the country. Ralph Nader embodies the
increasing presence of this type of po
litical awareness among young people.
Intermission ashed a Nader insider,
Stanford junior Peter Stair, to give a
first-hand account of the substance be
hind the Nader phenomenon. Peter is
currently an intent for the Nader
2000 campaign's D.C. press office.

l<S-to-24 age group often labeled
as poltically apathetic, and per
haps Nader's most famous catch
phrase has become a salient warn
ing during this year's electoral
campaigning: "11 you don't get
turned on to politics, politics will
turn on you."
With Nader's help, a move
ment criticized as hodge-podge
and even hypocritical is coming
together. The unifying concern
of the anarchist, socialist, envi
ronmentalist and labor union
protesters is well-articulated in
Nader's message: "Multinational
corporations are a threat to
democracy that no longer serve in
the public interest."
As a result of this ever-growing
base of youth support, Nader is
helping to build an environmen
talist / labor union, "blue-green"
coalition into a genuine progres
sive movement. The timing of
such a movement is ripe: those in
attendance in Oakland last Satur
day were energized with the hope
of long due political change.
At the super-rally, more aptly
described as a political rock con
cert, the audience of over 7,000
heard from a myriad of speakers
including Senate candidate
Medea Benjamin, Harvard Pro
lessor Cornel West, former Dean

"Welcome to the politics of joy
and justice."
It is a salutation Ralph Nader
lias repeated throughout his c am
paign for president, and it was the
message of his speech before an
overflow crowd at Oakland's
Kaiser Arena last Saturday night.
The audience, largely made up of
young activists and first-time vot
ers, has helped create a new gen
eration of politically conscious
men and women who constitute a
growing wedge of vocal citizens,
especially on college campuses
like Stanford.

not ignore issues important to the

an eclectic and irreverent political
campaign. The Nader catnp, part
ol the growing progressive politi
cal movement across the country,
has featured a controversial take
off of a MasterCard advertise
ment ["Grilled tenderloin for

paign ads filled with half-truths,
$10 million. Promises to special
interest groups, over $1(1 billion.

Supporters wearing chicken
suits and duck suits have shown
up at gatherings lor Gore and
Bush, asking, respectively, "Why
are you afraid of debating Ralph
Nader?" and "Why are you duck-

ing the important issues?" The
campaign has paid for three
"clean up politics" van tours, dri
ving around Southern and Mid-
Western st.ites embarrassing local
officials and handing out bars ol
soap. And Nader's supporters
range from Noam C.hompsky to
I'llil Donahue to Kddie Vedder.
Yet despite the campaign's ir
reverence, its "joy" is often some

what restrained. The moocl in
Oakland was a combination of
weariness and tentative excite
ment. When supporters left the
rally Saturday, they returned to a
world they perceived as hostile.
They believe our democracy has
been hijacked by powerful corpo
rations so effectively that our next
president will be more receptive
to C'.K( )s than citizens.
In the last two decades, they've
seen ihe wage of the average
worker decline, global warming
become a reality and repeated ef
forts at reform tail. Musician Patti
Smith told rally attendees, "My
spiritual heart is broken. My envi
ronmentalist heart is broken. But
it's on the mend. Its not gonna be
easy, but here we come." Then
she sang a haunting rendition ol
"Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"
which served as an apt demon
stration of how this new breed of
leftist citizens will not stop until
they have attained their dreams
of political change.
From consumer advocate to
presidential candidate
In 1959. Ralph Nader wrote in
The Nation, "It is clear that De

troit today is designing automo
biles for style, cost, performance
and calculated obsolescence, but
not - despite the 5,000,000 re
ported accidents, nearly 40,000
fatalities, 1 10,000 permanent dis
abilities and 1,500,000 injuries
yearly - for safety."
With those words and his best
seller, "Unsafe At Any Speed,"
Nader founded the consumer ad
vocacy movement. He aimed to
convince Americans that the
manufacturer, not the consumer,
should be responsible for danger
ous flaws in product design. And
he succeeded. Just months after
his book was published, (Congress
passed I lie National Traffic and
Motor Vehicle Safety Act.
Since then, Nader has helped
to bring seat belts and air bags to
our cars, to require a refund from
airliners if you're bumped 112 rom a
flight, to close down nuclear
plants and to force the govern
ment to make its records accessi
ble to regular citizens.
I !e has founded scores of orga
nizations, from the state-level
Public Interest Research Groups
to the branches of Public Citizen.
Mis organizations, to name just a
few efforts, monitor the records
of Congressmen, foster buyer co
operatives, light corporate wel
fare, call for environmental jus
tice and research the effects of
economic globalization. He has
been, without doubt, .in institu
tion builder.
His offices are also a farm for
future leaders. "Nader's
Raiders," a group that started as
seven college students investigat
ing the Federal Trade Commis
sion, now includes thousands of
people, from summer interns to
political associates. And, by de
sign, few work longer than a year
before moving their concerns into
other organizations.
With such a network, Nader
could easily have run for any
number of politic al offices. Kut he
always demurred. "I can accom

plish more by doing what I'm
doing," he always said, and, fora
while, he was right. In 1974, he
was ranked the fourth- most in
fluential person in America by
U.S. News & World Report.
But after the '70s, Nader had
reached his nadir. During the
1980s and '90s, his influenciF'on
the Hill waned, first Reagan tried
hard to dismantle the regulatory
agencies Nader had helped estab
lish. Then Washington saw a
gradual "moderation" in its politi
cians, with Democ rats moving to
wards the Republicans and both
moving closer to corporations.
Well-funded lobbyists came in
to Washington, and backed by
companies willing to give to ei
ther party, they crowded out
Nader's much poorer citizen
groups. Between 1991 and 1992
and this year's election cycle, do
nations to political parties and
candidates went up from $700
million to $ 1.('» billion.
During the '90s, Nader was,
like most American workers,
working harder than ever for less
than what he earned in 1973.
Over that time, his frustration
grew and, consequently, his writ
ings and public presentations be
came more urgent. Now, his cam
paign speeches consist mostly of
details of what he sees as Ameri
can societal regress and excess.
The disparity of wealth is too
great, he says, the pollution of our
environment too much, our cities
too decrepit and our trade agree
ments too corporation-oriented.
The "hopeful" vision he proffers
often involves holding back.
In the end, his vision simply
looks toward what other indus
trialized nations have accom
plished long ago: universal
health care, abolition of child
poverty, demilitarization and
well-funded mass-transit sys
tems. With legislators no longer
receptive to grassroots lobbying,
Nader's conclusion is that only a
sustained citizen effort can
change our political system.
"I can no longer stomach the
systematic political decay that
has weakened our democracy,"

he said at this summer's Green
Party convention."It is neces
sary to launch a sustained effort
to wrest control of our democra
cy from the corporate govern
ment and restore it to the politi
cal government under the con
trol of citizens."
Reviving the progressive
movement
Many of Nader's supporters
are not those familiar with his
work in Washington, I).CI. Many
of his advocates have not read
"Unsafe At Any Speed" or were
too young to witness his pre-'HOs
push to shepherd Congressional
legislation.
To many, like those who led
the anti-World Trade Organiza
tion protests in Seattle or demon
strated at the Democratic and Re
publican National Conventions,
Nader has simply emerged as the
only eloquent voice for their out
rage, a voice that is not afraid to
actually tell the truth.
While the success of this youth
movement does not hinge on the
outcome of the 2000 presidential
election, it will certainly have an
effect. If Nader does well, politi
cians will take notice of his plat
form.
If lit- receives five percent of
the national vote, the Green
Party candidate in 2004 will re
ceive more than $7 million dol
lars in federal matching funds,
and this was nearly all it took for
commentators to take the Re
form Party seriously.
Success for Nader and the new
progressives also depends on
whether citizens are willing to re
ject the choices presented to them
by the Democratic and Republi
can parties. Though a significant
amount of Nader's support
comes from previous non-voters,
much of it lias also come from
those historically more partial to
the Democratic Party.
Democratic loyals are now
threatening that "a vote for
Nader is a vote for Bush." Nader
has often countered that "a vote
for Gore is a vote for Bush," al

luding to the disturbing similari
ties between the two major candi
dates. Joking aside, however, the
argumentative logic behind a
statement claiming that Nader
voters are throwing away their
votes is inherently flawed. A
democracy only succeeds when its
citizens are willing to vote fora
candidate they believe in. not vot
ing out of fear in order to support
the "lesser of two evils."
Furthermore, because of our
country's electoral college system,
voting for Nader will only "take
away" votes from a major party
candidate in the swing states, and
California (along with its massive
electoral tally of 54) is currently
safe in the hands of Gore.
For those who are skeptical
that a vote for Nader is actually a
sustained call for change, Nader,
of course, has words ol" encour
agement for them.
"It wasn't easy for Rosa Parks
when she decided to sit in the
front of the bus," he said. "It was
not easy when the first organizers
decided to form a labor union or
when women marched for the
right to vote. And things got
worse before they got better, but
they would not have improved
without the principled bravery of
a few." It is a message he has de
livered at bis super-rallies, as well
as during his talk here in Memor
ial Auditorium last Monday.
If he is to make history, howev
er, Nader must stir the outrage of
his audience. Far from pander
ing, he must simultaneously dis
turb and enliven his core con
stituents. Whether his super-ral
lies are the beginnings of a his
toric movement is unclear, but
they are part of the most unex
pected campaign of this election
and, regardless of whether or not
someone chooses to vote for
Nader, it is becoming harder and
harder not to pay attention to his
voice and the millions of voices of
his supporters.

His offices are also a farm for
future leaders. "Nader's
Raiders," a group that started as
seven college students investigat
ing the Federal Trade Commis
sion, now includes thousands of
people, from summer interns to
political associates. And, by de
sign, few work longer than a year
before moving their concerns into
other organizations.
With such a network, Nader
could easily have run for any
number of politic al offices. Kut he
always demurred. "I can accom

plish more by doing what I'm
doing," he always said, and, fora
while, he was right. In 1974, he
was ranked the fourth- most in
fluential person in America by
U.S. News & World Report.
But after the '70s, Nader had
reached his nadir. During the
1980s and '90s, his influenciF'on
the Hill waned, first Reagan tried
hard to dismantle the regulatory
agencies Nader had helped estab
lish. Then Washington saw a
gradual "moderation" in its politi
cians, with Democ rats moving to
wards the Republicans and both
moving closer to corporations.
Well-funded lobbyists came in
to Washington, and backed by
companies willing to give to ei
ther party, they crowded out
Nader's much poorer citizen
groups. Between 1991 and 1992
and this year's election cycle, do
nations to political parties and
candidates went up from $700
million to $ 1.('» billion.
During the '90s, Nader was,
like most American workers,
working harder than ever for less
than what he earned in 1973.
Over that time, his frustration
grew and, consequently, his writ
ings and public presentations be
came more urgent. Now, his cam
paign speeches consist mostly of
details of what he sees as Ameri
can societal regress and excess.
The disparity of wealth is too
great, he says, the pollution of our
environment too much, our cities
too decrepit and our trade agree
ments too corporation-oriented.
The "hopeful" vision he proffers
often involves holding back.
In the end, his vision simply
looks toward what other indus
trialized nations have accom
plished long ago: universal
health care, abolition of child
poverty, demilitarization and
well-funded mass-transit sys
tems. With legislators no longer
receptive to grassroots lobbying,
Nader's conclusion is that only a
sustained citizen effort can
change our political system.
"I can no longer stomach the
systematic political decay that
has weakened our democracy,"

he said at this summer's Green
Party convention."It is neces
sary to launch a sustained effort
to wrest control of our democra
cy from the corporate govern
ment and restore it to the politi
cal government under the con
trol of citizens."
Reviving the progressive
movement
Many of Nader's supporters
are not those familiar with his
work in Washington, I).CI. Many
of his advocates have not read
"Unsafe At Any Speed" or were
too young to witness his pre-'HOs
push to shepherd Congressional
legislation.
To many, like those who led
the anti-World Trade Organiza
tion protests in Seattle or demon
strated at the Democratic and Re
publican National Conventions,
Nader has simply emerged as the
only eloquent voice for their out
rage, a voice that is not afraid to
actually tell the truth.
While the success of this youth
movement does not hinge on the
outcome of the 2000 presidential
election, it will certainly have an
effect. If Nader does well, politi
cians will take notice of his plat
form.
If lit- receives five percent of
the national vote, the Green
Party candidate in 2004 will re
ceive more than $7 million dol
lars in federal matching funds,
and this was nearly all it took for
commentators to take the Re
form Party seriously.
Success for Nader and the new
progressives also depends on
whether citizens are willing to re
ject the choices presented to them
by the Democratic and Republi
can parties. Though a significant
amount of Nader's support
comes from previous non-voters,
much of it lias also come from
those historically more partial to
the Democratic Party.
Democratic loyals are now
threatening that "a vote for
Nader is a vote for Bush." Nader
has often countered that "a vote
for Gore is a vote for Bush," al

luding to the disturbing similari
ties between the two major candi
dates. Joking aside, however, the
argumentative logic behind a
statement claiming that Nader
voters are throwing away their
votes is inherently flawed. A
democracy only succeeds when its
citizens are willing to vote fora
candidate they believe in. not vot
ing out of fear in order to support
the "lesser of two evils."
Furthermore, because of our
country's electoral college system,
voting for Nader will only "take
away" votes from a major party
candidate in the swing states, and
California (along with its massive
electoral tally of 54) is currently
safe in the hands of Gore.
For those who are skeptical
that a vote for Nader is actually a
sustained call for change, Nader,
of course, has words ol" encour
agement for them.
"It wasn't easy for Rosa Parks
when she decided to sit in the
front of the bus," he said. "It was
not easy when the first organizers
decided to form a labor union or
when women marched for the
right to vote. And things got
worse before they got better, but
they would not have improved
without the principled bravery of
a few." It is a message he has de
livered at bis super-rallies, as well
as during his talk here in Memor
ial Auditorium last Monday.
If he is to make history, howev
er, Nader must stir the outrage of
his audience. Far from pander
ing, he must simultaneously dis
turb and enliven his core con
stituents. Whether his super-ral
lies are the beginnings of a his
toric movement is unclear, but
they are part of the most unex
pected campaign of this election
and, regardless of whether or not
someone chooses to vote for
Nader, it is becoming harder and
harder not to pay attention to his
voice and the millions of voices of
his supporters.

Editor's Note: Phis article examines
the groining trend of progressive ac

increasing presence of this type of po
litical awareness among young people.

Stanford junior Peter Stair, to give a
first-hand account of the substance be
hind the Nader phenomenon. Peter is
currently an intent for the Nader
2000 campaign's D.C. press office.

l<S-to-24 age group often labeled
as poltically apathetic, and per
haps Nader's most famous catch
phrase has become a salient warn
ing during this year's electoral
campaigning: "11 you don't get
turned on to politics, politics will
turn on you."
With Nader's help, a move
ment criticized as hodge-podge
and even hypocritical is coming
together. The unifying concern
of the anarchist, socialist, envi
ronmentalist and labor union
protesters is well-articulated in
Nader's message: "Multinational
corporations are a threat to
democracy that no longer serve in
the public interest."
As a result of this ever-growing
base of youth support, Nader is
helping to build an environmen
talist / labor union, "blue-green"
coalition into a genuine progres
sive movement. The timing of
such a movement is ripe: those in
attendance in Oakland last Satur
day were energized with the hope
of long due political change.
At the super-rally, more aptly
described as a political rock con
cert, the audience of over 7,000
heard from a myriad of speakers
including Senate candidate
Medea Benjamin, Harvard Pro
lessor Cornel West, former Dean

"Welcome to the politics of joy
and justice."
It is a salutation Ralph Nader
lias repeated throughout his c am
paign for president, and it was the
message of his speech before an
overflow crowd at Oakland's
Kaiser Arena last Saturday night.
The audience, largely made up of
young activists and first-time vot
ers, has helped create a new gen
eration of politically conscious
men and women who constitute a
growing wedge of vocal citizens,
especially on college campuses
like Stanford.
Nader's stance is one that does
not ignore issues important to the

Kennedys hand member Jello Ui
afra, cartoonist Tom Tomorrow
who actually acted out a car
toon featuring his character
"Sparky" — and singer Patti
Smith.
It was the eighth super-rally in

an eclectic and irreverent political
campaign. The Nader catnp, part
ol the growing progressive politi
cal movement across the country,
has featured a controversial take
off of a MasterCard advertise
ment ["Grilled tenderloin for
fund-raiser, $1000 a plate. Cam
paign ads filled with half-truths,
$10 million. Promises to special
interest groups, over $1(1 billion.

Finding out the truth, priceless."]
Supporters wearing chicken
suits and duck suits have shown
up at gatherings lor Gore and
Bush, asking, respectively, "Why
are you afraid of debating Ralph
Nader?" and "Why are you duck-

ing the important issues?" The
campaign has paid for three
"clean up politics" van tours, dri
ving around Southern and Mid-
Western st.ites embarrassing local
officials and handing out bars ol
soap. And Nader's supporters
range from Noam C.hompsky to
I'llil Donahue to Kddie Vedder.
Yet despite the campaign's ir
reverence, its "joy" is often some

what restrained. The moocl in
Oakland was a combination of
weariness and tentative excite
ment. When supporters left the
rally Saturday, they returned to a
world they perceived as hostile.
They believe our democracy has
been hijacked by powerful corpo
rations so effectively that our next
president will be more receptive
to C'.K( )s than citizens.
In the last two decades, they've
seen ihe wage of the average
worker decline, global warming
become a reality and repeated ef
forts at reform tail. Musician Patti
Smith told rally attendees, "My
spiritual heart is broken. My envi
ronmentalist heart is broken. But
it's on the mend. Its not gonna be
easy, but here we come." Then
she sang a haunting rendition ol
"Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"
which served as an apt demon
stration of how this new breed of
leftist citizens will not stop until
they have attained their dreams
of political change.
From consumer advocate to
presidential candidate
In 1959. Ralph Nader wrote in
The Nation, "It is clear that De

troit today is designing automo
biles for style, cost, performance
and calculated obsolescence, but
not - despite the 5,000,000 re
ported accidents, nearly 40,000
fatalities, 1 10,000 permanent dis
abilities and 1,500,000 injuries
yearly - for safety."
With those words and his best
seller, "Unsafe At Any Speed,"
Nader founded the consumer ad
vocacy movement. He aimed to
convince Americans that the
manufacturer, not the consumer,
should be responsible for danger
ous flaws in product design. And
he succeeded. Just months after
his book was published, (Congress
passed I lie National Traffic and
Motor Vehicle Safety Act.
Since then, Nader has helped
to bring seat belts and air bags to
our cars, to require a refund from
airliners if you're bumped 112 rom a
flight, to close down nuclear
plants and to force the govern
ment to make its records accessi
ble to regular citizens.
I !e has founded scores of orga
nizations, from the state-level
Public Interest Research Groups
to the branches of Public Citizen.
Mis organizations, to name just a
few efforts, monitor the records
of Congressmen, foster buyer co
operatives, light corporate wel
fare, call for environmental jus
tice and research the effects of
economic globalization. He has
been, without doubt, .in institu
tion builder.
His offices are also a farm for
future leaders. "Nader's
Raiders," a group that started as
seven college students investigat

Nader, it is becoming harder and
harder not to pay attention to his
voice and the millions of voices of
his supporters.

Editor's Note: Phis article examines
the groining trend of progressive ac
tivism on college cam puses'throughout
the country. Ralph Nader embodies the
increasing presence of this type of po
litical awareness among young people.
Intermission ashed a Nader insider,
Stanford junior Peter Stair, to give a
first-hand account of the substance be
hind the Nader phenomenon. Peter is
currently an intent for the Nader
2000 campaign's D.C. press office.

l<S-to-24 age group often labeled
as poltically apathetic, and per
haps Nader's most famous catch
phrase has become a salient warn
ing during this year's electoral
campaigning: "11 you don't get
turned on to politics, politics will
turn on you."
With Nader's help, a move
ment criticized as hodge-podge
and even hypocritical is coming
together. The unifying concern
of the anarchist, socialist, envi
ronmentalist and labor union
protesters is well-articulated in
Nader's message: "Multinational
corporations are a threat to
democracy that no longer serve in
the public interest."
As a result of this ever-growing
base of youth support, Nader is
helping to build an environmen
talist / labor union, "blue-green"
coalition into a genuine progres
sive movement. The timing of
such a movement is ripe: those in
attendance in Oakland last Satur
day were energized with the hope
of long due political change.
At the super-rally, more aptly
described as a political rock con
cert, the audience of over 7,000
heard from a myriad of speakers
including Senate candidate
Medea Benjamin, Harvard Pro
lessor Cornel West, former Dean

"Welcome to the politics of joy
and justice."
It is a salutation Ralph Nader
lias repeated throughout his c am
paign for president, and it was the
message of his speech before an
overflow crowd at Oakland's
Kaiser Arena last Saturday night.
The audience, largely made up of
young activists and first-time vot
ers, has helped create a new gen
eration of politically conscious
men and women who constitute a
growing wedge of vocal citizens,
especially on college campuses
like Stanford.
Nader's stance is one that does
not ignore issues important to the

Kennedys hand member Jello Ui
afra, cartoonist Tom Tomorrow
who actually acted out a car
toon featuring his character
"Sparky" — and singer Patti
Smith.

an eclectic and irreverent political
campaign. The Nader catnp, part
ol the growing progressive politi
cal movement across the country,
has featured a controversial take
off of a MasterCard advertise
ment ["Grilled tenderloin for
fund-raiser, $1000 a plate. Cam
paign ads filled with half-truths,
$10 million. Promises to special
interest groups, over $1(1 billion.

Finding out the truth, priceless."]
Supporters wearing chicken
suits and duck suits have shown
up at gatherings lor Gore and
Bush, asking, respectively, "Why
are you afraid of debating Ralph
Nader?" and "Why are you duck-

ing the important issues?" The
campaign has paid for three
"clean up politics" van tours, dri
ving around Southern and Mid-
Western st.ites embarrassing local
officials and handing out bars ol
soap. And Nader's supporters
range from Noam C.hompsky to
I'llil Donahue to Kddie Vedder.
Yet despite the campaign's ir
reverence, its "joy" is often some

what restrained. The moocl in
Oakland was a combination of
weariness and tentative excite
ment. When supporters left the
rally Saturday, they returned to a
world they perceived as hostile.
They believe our democracy has
been hijacked by powerful corpo
rations so effectively that our next
president will be more receptive
to C'.K( )s than citizens.
In the last two decades, they've
seen ihe wage of the average
worker decline, global warming
become a reality and repeated ef
forts at reform tail. Musician Patti
Smith told rally attendees, "My
spiritual heart is broken. My envi
ronmentalist heart is broken. But
it's on the mend. Its not gonna be
easy, but here we come." Then
she sang a haunting rendition ol
"Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"
which served as an apt demon
stration of how this new breed of
leftist citizens will not stop until
they have attained their dreams
of political change.
From consumer advocate to
presidential candidate
In 1959. Ralph Nader wrote in
The Nation, "It is clear that De

troit today is designing automo
biles for style, cost, performance
and calculated obsolescence, but
not - despite the 5,000,000 re
ported accidents, nearly 40,000
fatalities, 1 10,000 permanent dis
abilities and 1,500,000 injuries
yearly - for safety."
With those words and his best
seller, "Unsafe At Any Speed,"
Nader founded the consumer ad
vocacy movement. He aimed to
convince Americans that the
manufacturer, not the consumer,
should be responsible for danger
ous flaws in product design. And
he succeeded. Just months after
his book was published, (Congress
passed I lie National Traffic and
Motor Vehicle Safety Act.
Since then, Nader has helped
to bring seat belts and air bags to
our cars, to require a refund from
airliners if you're bumped 112 rom a
flight, to close down nuclear
plants and to force the govern
ment to make its records accessi
ble to regular citizens.
I !e has founded scores of orga
nizations, from the state-level
Public Interest Research Groups
to the branches of Public Citizen.
Mis organizations, to name just a
few efforts, monitor the records
of Congressmen, foster buyer co
operatives, light corporate wel
fare, call for environmental jus
tice and research the effects of
economic globalization. He has
been, without doubt, .in institu
tion builder.
His offices are also a farm for
future leaders. "Nader's
Raiders," a group that started as
seven college students investigat
ing the Federal Trade Commis
sion, now includes thousands of
people, from summer interns to
political associates. And, by de
sign, few work longer than a year
before moving their concerns into
other organizations.
With such a network, Nader
could easily have run for any
number of politic al offices. Kut he
always demurred. "I can accom

plish more by doing what I'm
doing," he always said, and, fora
while, he was right. In 1974, he
was ranked the fourth- most in
fluential person in America by
U.S. News & World Report.
But after the '70s, Nader had
reached his nadir. During the
1980s and '90s, his influenciF'on
the Hill waned, first Reagan tried
hard to dismantle the regulatory
agencies Nader had helped estab
lish. Then Washington saw a
gradual "moderation" in its politi
cians, with Democ rats moving to
wards the Republicans and both
moving closer to corporations.
Well-funded lobbyists came in
to Washington, and backed by
companies willing to give to ei
ther party, they crowded out
Nader's much poorer citizen
groups. Between 1991 and 1992
and this year's election cycle, do
nations to political parties and
candidates went up from $700
million to $ 1.('» billion.
During the '90s, Nader was,
like most American workers,
working harder than ever for less
than what he earned in 1973.
Over that time, his frustration
grew and, consequently, his writ
ings and public presentations be
came more urgent. Now, his cam
paign speeches consist mostly of
details of what he sees as Ameri
can societal regress and excess.
The disparity of wealth is too
great, he says, the pollution of our
environment too much, our cities
too decrepit and our trade agree
ments too corporation-oriented.
The "hopeful" vision he proffers
often involves holding back.
In the end, his vision simply
looks toward what other indus
trialized nations have accom
plished long ago: universal
health care, abolition of child
poverty, demilitarization and
well-funded mass-transit sys
tems. With legislators no longer
receptive to grassroots lobbying,
Nader's conclusion is that only a
sustained citizen effort can
change our political system.
"I can no longer stomach the
systematic political decay that
has weakened our democracy,"

he said at this summer's Green
Party convention."It is neces
sary to launch a sustained effort
to wrest control of our democra
cy from the corporate govern
ment and restore it to the politi
cal government under the con
trol of citizens."
Reviving the progressive
movement
Many of Nader's supporters
are not those familiar with his
work in Washington, I).CI. Many
of his advocates have not read
"Unsafe At Any Speed" or were
too young to witness his pre-'HOs
push to shepherd Congressional
legislation.
To many, like those who led
the anti-World Trade Organiza
tion protests in Seattle or demon
strated at the Democratic and Re
publican National Conventions,
Nader has simply emerged as the
only eloquent voice for their out
rage, a voice that is not afraid to
actually tell the truth.
While the success of this youth
movement does not hinge on the
outcome of the 2000 presidential
election, it will certainly have an
effect. If Nader does well, politi
cians will take notice of his plat
form.
If lit- receives five percent of
the national vote, the Green
Party candidate in 2004 will re
ceive more than $7 million dol
lars in federal matching funds,
and this was nearly all it took for
commentators to take the Re
form Party seriously.
Success for Nader and the new
progressives also depends on
whether citizens are willing to re
ject the choices presented to them
by the Democratic and Republi
can parties. Though a significant
amount of Nader's support
comes from previous non-voters,
much of it lias also come from
those historically more partial to
the Democratic Party.
Democratic loyals are now
threatening that "a vote for
Nader is a vote for Bush." Nader
has often countered that "a vote
for Gore is a vote for Bush," al

luding to the disturbing similari
ties between the two major candi
dates. Joking aside, however, the
argumentative logic behind a
statement claiming that Nader
voters are throwing away their
votes is inherently flawed. A
democracy only succeeds when its
citizens are willing to vote fora
candidate they believe in. not vot
ing out of fear in order to support
the "lesser of two evils."
Furthermore, because of our
country's electoral college system,
voting for Nader will only "take
away" votes from a major party
candidate in the swing states, and
California (along with its massive
electoral tally of 54) is currently
safe in the hands of Gore.
For those who are skeptical
that a vote for Nader is actually a
sustained call for change, Nader,
of course, has words ol" encour
agement for them.
"It wasn't easy for Rosa Parks
when she decided to sit in the
front of the bus," he said. "It was
not easy when the first organizers
decided to form a labor union or
when women marched for the
right to vote. And things got
worse before they got better, but
they would not have improved
without the principled bravery of
a few." It is a message he has de
livered at bis super-rallies, as well
as during his talk here in Memor
ial Auditorium last Monday.
If he is to make history, howev
er, Nader must stir the outrage of
his audience. Far from pander
ing, he must simultaneously dis
turb and enliven his core con
stituents. Whether his super-ral
lies are the beginnings of a his
toric movement is unclear, but
they are part of the most unex
pected campaign of this election
and, regardless of whether or not
someone chooses to vote for
Nader, it is becoming harder and
harder not to pay attention to his
voice and the millions of voices of
his supporters.
