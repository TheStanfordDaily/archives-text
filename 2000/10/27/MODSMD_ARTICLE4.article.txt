Yesterday's Faculty Senate meeting agenda was
overshadowed l>y discussion of the potential derail
ment of Stanford's land use proposal. Although the
(ieneral Use Permit was not <i scheduled agenda item,
Provost John Etchemendy addressed the issue and
many faculty members voiced their support of Stan
ford's General Use Permit and their dismay at Santa
Clara Supervisor Joe Simitian's latest proposal.
"()n I uesday evening, Santa ( lara (ounty Super
visor Joe Simitian .. . [asked] that for even 2,000
square feet of academic development, Stanford set
aside one acre of land outside the academic campus
for thi' next 99 years. Such dedications are unwar
ranted, and according to our lawyers, ma\ be unlaw
ful," said Ktchemendy.
Civil and Environmental Engineering Prof.
Stephen Monismith, "stunned" b\ Simitian's unilat
eral proposal, read to the Senate a letter he had sent
to the Santa C '.lara County Hoard.
"I'm writing to urge you and your colleagues to .. .
reject the recent proposals of Supervisor Simitian. It
is strikingly unfair to propose unilaterally a condition

lhat Stanford can never accept," read Monismith.
Linguistics Prof. John Rick ford and English Pro!.
Robert Polhemus also expressed surprise at Simit
ian's actions.
" There's a sense that some members of the com
munity seem to feel that opposing all Stanford plans
is the right thing to do," commented Ricklord.
Etchemendy replied that he has tried to in lorlll the
neighboring communities that "we aren't a horrible
organization and we don't have a secret group that
plans horrible things."
Etchemendy urged members of the Stanford com
munity to attend the public hearing being held by the
Santa (llara C bounty Board of Supervisors on Monday
at 7 p.m. The Santa Clara County Board of Supervi
sors will vote on whether to pass the General Use Per
mit on Tuesday.
In scheduled business, Asst. Vice Provost and Di
rector of Undergraduate Advising Lori White pre
sented a report on undergraduate advising.
While White stated that great strides have been
made in the advising program, she remains con
cerned about the low level of faculty involvement in
