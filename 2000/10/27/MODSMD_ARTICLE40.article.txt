# MUSIC REVIEW EXTRAVAGANZA
## Simon sings of love, life... again! 
### HILARY BIENSTOCK STAFF WRITER 
"You're the One," like the names ol
many other Paul Simon albums, seems like
11 should be about love songs. Hut it's actu
ally trying to express more universal prob
lems, like gaining and losing love and get
ting old.
Paul Simon understands too much
about the facts ol life and the transitory na
ture ol love to make an album ol simple
love songs. Kven the songs that start out
being about love are really broader than
the\ seem at first. "To ask somebody to love
\Oll takes a lot of nerve," sings Simon. It
rings true.

Fans ol his more ethnic-influenced
music will leel .1 bit disappointed by his lat
esi effort. 1 he music lacks a certain punch
that his best-known albums, "(iraceland"
and "Rhytlun of the Saints," gain from
their African and South American influ
ences. Probably the catchiest songs on
"You're the ()ne" are those that incorporate
the bouncy rhythms ol his previous ellbrts.
"Old," the song that's gotten the most
radio play, is a delightfulk whimsical look .11
encroai hing age. In ,1 humorous yet desper
ate ellort to hang on to his youth, Simon lists
things ib.it are actually old â€” the Bible, (>od,
Adam and Kve. The repetitive chords sound
almost like a gentler version ol /.ydeco or like
a return to the days ol "Me and Julio Down !>v
the School Yard."

The title track, too, starts out with boun
cy, playful drums and a tropical feeling
reminiscent of "Late in the Evening." Hut
then Simon overlays a sentimental meta-

love song, as he is wont
to do, downplaying the
energy of the beat.
"You're the one / You
broke my heart/ You
made me cry," sings
Simon Kven when the
song picks up and re-

gains some of its ener
gy, a brief crooning passage in a minor key
and disconsolate lyrics belie its cheerful
rhythms.
Probably the- single strongest track on
tlie album is "Look at That," an upbeat

tune that incorporates comfortingly repet
itive maracas along with the all-pervasive
acoustic guitar. Simon's sprightly and sen
timental lyrics meander from topic to

topic, somehow creating a
unified whole out of sepa
rately meaningless phrases.
A wonderful nonsense-syl
lable bridge in this song is
the closest this album comes
to African chanting.
But Simon can deliver on

slower songs, too. The final
piece, "Quiet," has not only the soft touch
of a lullaby, bill the beauty and solemnity of
.i western spiritual. It's at times like these
that we miss Art (iarfunkel's silken bar-

monies. "I'm heading lor a plate
of quiet," Simon sings, "where
ilit' sage and sweet grass grow /
By a lake of sacred waters from
the mountains' snow." The
droned background music and
the plaintive howl in his voice
make him sound like a retired
cowboy nostalgically recalling his
ranching days.
Nowadays, the beauty of
Simon's voice comes from its fa
miliarity and not its'inherently
dulcet tones. Then again, that
could be what makes this simple
tune so effective.
In between the gems on this
album are more of the soft
acoustic-guitar melodies that by
now are Paul Simon standbys.
They incorporate a liberal sprin
kling of humor but barely a trace
of the hard edges he used to have
(or pretended to have). Instead,
lie now sounds benevolently
amused. Paul Simon is mellow
ing out: He's now fifty-nine years
old, and it shows in his music.
"You're The One" is a quiet,
simple collection of songs about
growing old and thinking things
over. It's not the masterpiece that
some of his other oeuvres are.
But it does contain its share of
notable songs and an overall
beauty, whimsicality and unity
that make it worth a listen.
