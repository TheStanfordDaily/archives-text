Kngland, Jega is 2b year-old
Dylan Nathan, a former ar
chitecture school student
whose raw talent was origi
nally captured on several

seven-inch and twelve-inch K.l'.s from a few
small U.K. labels. "Spectrum" was bis first
record released on the U.S.-based indepen
dent label Matador Records and received
widespread acclaim for its carefully con
strutted synthesis of spasmodic percussion

and moody rhythms.
"(ieoinelrv" is an equally complex and
creative opus thai resonates with intensit\
and ba( klucaking beats. As a whole, the
album is darker and more melaiu hol\ than
"Spectrum. which probably reflects leva's
maturation as .in electronic .irtist in the two
years sin< e ils release.

(tone are the
somewhat tacky ex
perimental tracks
like "Red Mullet"
.iiul "Bikini Ski Boat"
that were part o! the
eclectic mix on
"Spectrum." "(ieom
etry" is a much more

coherent album that, t.iken as a whole, is an
imaginative cornucopia of richly textural,
anarchic sounds.
"Alternating Hit" kicksofl the album with a
nightmarish bleud of raw, metallic beats that
blend with haunting string reverberations to

create .1 frenetic sound that surges toward a
densely emotional < Umax and tapers oil', lead
ing into "Syntax free, which continues in
the same vibe. Jega adds chimes to this second
track and in doing so, creates a fervid duel be
tween these soothing, somewhat passive
sounds, .ind the obnoxiously raw beats and
snarling rhythms that pervade the track,
thereby contributing to the fiercely chaotic
theme of the album.
Most of the tracks are masterful blends
of fortuitous noise and mangled melodies.
"Recursion," with its stuttering beats and
buz/ing percussion, is an impatient and en
ergetic track akin to a frantic, high-speed
police chase down an interstate. "Rigid
Body Dynamics" is equally spirited, yet
seems to be even more fervent, with its grit
ty, piercing mechanical beats that are musi
cally comparable to nails scraping down a
chalkboard.
"Post Mid Arc" and "Motion Math" both
trend toward the industrial and are doini

nated by piic kly melodies and coarser,
more guttural sounds that are smothered
in a mechanical overprint. In "Motion
Math," the heats are so erratic and frantic
that it seems like Jega is battling to keep the
track from going totally out of control.
Not all of "(ieometry" is so spasmodic.
"Breakpoint Knvelope" is not as griity as ;i
lot of the other tracks. Its complex heats are
cleaner and not as tinny and the rhythm,
though erratic, is punctuated hy sporadic
bursts of gurgly sounds that aren't as sinis-

Yup, that's Jega. Right there. In the mid
dle. No, not the bunny, silly.
