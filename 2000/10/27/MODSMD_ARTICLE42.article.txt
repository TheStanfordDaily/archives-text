# MUSIC REVIEW EXTRAVAGANZA
## Buying E-40 like buying pot 100 Short, Pimp C and Baby pop their collars and do some 'Flamboasting' with E-40

way they have it," I thought.
Suddenly the clerk picked up
the phone and said, "We certain
ly do."
1 couldn't believe it. "Mow
much is it?" I said.
"$16.99." Oh. At least The
Daily was paying.
In a lot of ways, my experience

with "Koyalh and Betrayal" that
day was analogous to an experi
ence with marijuana. Although I
thought it would he more diffi
cult, obtaining the album was a
simple matter ol making a (.ill
and exchanging cash fora prod
uct.
It was also more expensive
than I would have liked. I'pon
use ol said product, my immedi
ate response was elation and
laughter.
I experienced the first track,
simply called "Intro," a few sec
onds after having walked briskh
to my car and sliding the product
into my compact disc player. I was
skeptical because a trend has
emerged in the rap industry of re
leasing albums in the interest of
quantity instead of quality and, in
the past, K-40 has been especially
susceptible to artistic fatigue.
My concerns were alleviated as
soon as I heard K-40's voice, ac
companied by that of his alter ego

on back-up vocals. It was as ii he
were speaking directly to me.
"Now that you done purchased
this ver\ valuable piece of infor
mation (now that v ail done pur
chased it), done had a hard time
takin the plastic off, done threw
the shit in the middle of the
parkin' lot, before you done leli

. . ." True, true.
The album starts out lame and
gets progressively better. In
fact, I would argue it doesn't
really start until track number
five, "Sinister Mob," a classic
piece of K-40 mob music featur
ing frequent collaborator Nate
Dogg. The hassliue is intoxicating
and the incessant rumble makes
one want to buy a very old Amer
ican car, install more than one
very large subwooler in the trunk
and ride around Kast Oakland in
the middle of the night with the
volume at obscene levels.
