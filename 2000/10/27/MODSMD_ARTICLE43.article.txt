If yon don't recognize the name Dame (irea.se,
then maybe this will help. Dame (irease is the inulti
platinum man behind (lie sounds of some of today's
most popular hip-hop artists, including DMX ("(iet
At Me Dog"), the FOX ("We'll Always Love llig

Poppa" and "Money, Power & Re
spect"), Nas ("Some of Us Have An
gels"), Noreaga ("Body in the 1 runk")
and Fat Joe ("Triplets"). Dame is also the
name behind hits by rap legends Run
DMC and cats as diverse as Scarlace,
Fricky and Muggs.
With all of his popular success,
Dame's new album, released on his own

Vacant Lot Records, brings it all hack to the streets
of I larlem, where he first got his shine on as a mem
ber of N.1.8. "Dame Cirease Presents Live on
Lenox" does what many alliums fail to do - it com
bines today's powerhouse rappers (like I)MX, Nas,
Scar face, Noreaga, Cam' Ron, Drag'on and Silkk the
Shocker) with up-and-coming ghetto celebs (like
Bigga Threat, Mad.ls.On, E-Snapps, Meeno, Baby
Madison and N.1.8. Untouchables).
Dame addresses this major undertaking with
confidence: "I know what's hot, and my dogs are

lire. Kadi nigga that I've got on my album, you're
never, ever going to hear anybody that spits like
ih.it. When I choose artists, I choose distinctive
artists. My artists are straight original and I think it
was good to put my artists in the mix with the big
dogs. Niggas know how to rhyme."
The album blasts oil bla/iu' with three bangin'
joints. "The Future," featuring DMX, liig Stan and
Meeno, opens up with street sounds, sirens, the
sounds of mass protests and news reporters' voices
trying to describe what's about to be dropped on
I larlem.

"Nigga Haters" is a
glimpse of what we can ex
pect 011 Scai I.ice's new
album, "The Last of a Dying
Breed." Kate is still spilling
his street knowledge and he
seems rejuvenated working
with new artists like lieanie
Sigel as well as some Vacant

Lot signees. The next track is a solo joint by Vacant
Lot's Memo, "I'm That Nigga." Meeno Ilexes his
skills with an ill How that's hoth humorous and seri
ons. Rapping with a distinct voice, he also flips dis
tinct rhymes. He'll have everybody remembering
those three words: "I'm Thaaat Niggaaaa.
The album's high points come right in the mid
dle of the album with track eight, "Never Thought,"
(featuring Tony Wink, Meeno and Baby Madison)
