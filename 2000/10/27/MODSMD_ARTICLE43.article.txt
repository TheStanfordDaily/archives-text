If yon don't recognize the name Dame (irea.se,
then maybe this will help. Dame (irease is the inulti
platinum man behind (lie sounds of some of today's
most popular hip-hop artists, including DMX ("(iet
At Me Dog"), the FOX ("We'll Always Love llig

Poppa" and "Money, Power & Re
spect"), Nas ("Some of Us Have An
gels"), Noreaga ("Body in the 1 runk")
and Fat Joe ("Triplets"). Dame is also the
name behind hits by rap legends Run
DMC and cats as diverse as Scarlace,
Fricky and Muggs.
With all of his popular success,
Dame's new album, released on his own

Vacant Lot Records, brings it all hack to the streets
of I larlem, where he first got his shine on as a mem
ber of N.1.8. "Dame Cirease Presents Live on
Lenox" does what many alliums fail to do - it com
bines today's powerhouse rappers (like I)MX, Nas,
Scar face, Noreaga, Cam' Ron, Drag'on and Silkk the
Shocker) with up-and-coming ghetto celebs (like
Bigga Threat, Mad.ls.On, E-Snapps, Meeno, Baby
Madison and N.1.8. Untouchables).
Dame addresses this major undertaking with
confidence: "I know what's hot, and my dogs are

lire. Kadi nigga that I've got on my album, you're
never, ever going to hear anybody that spits like
ih.it. When I choose artists, I choose distinctive
artists. My artists are straight original and I think it
was good to put my artists in the mix with the big
dogs. Niggas know how to rhyme."
The album blasts oil bla/iu' with three bangin'
joints. "The Future," featuring DMX, liig Stan and
Meeno, opens up with street sounds, sirens, the
sounds of mass protests and news reporters' voices
trying to describe what's about to be dropped on
I larlem.

"Nigga Haters" is a
glimpse of what we can ex
pect 011 Scai I.ice's new
album, "The Last of a Dying
Breed." Kate is still spilling
his street knowledge and he
seems rejuvenated working
with new artists like lieanie
Sigel as well as some Vacant

Lot signees. The next track is a solo joint by Vacant
Lot's Memo, "I'm That Nigga." Meeno Ilexes his
skills with an ill How that's hoth humorous and seri
ons. Rapping with a distinct voice, he also flips dis
tinct rhymes. He'll have everybody remembering
those three words: "I'm Thaaat Niggaaaa.
The album's high points come right in the mid
dle of the album with track eight, "Never Thought,"
(featuring Tony Wink, Meeno and Baby Madison)

"A producer who can rap and control the maestro."
and nine, "Dedication," (featur
ing Mad. Is. On). "Never
Thought" is a glimpse into the
struggles each rapper had to fat e
while coining up in the game.
Tony Winks drops a powerful
rhyme: "Even though 1 got a
deal, I still hustle in the rain /
Fuck fame, these cold streets run
through my veins / Like a AIDS
infected baby born addicted to
cain. Lookin' back on the years,
like the streets ain't changed."
The song has a reflective, remi
niscent feel. Meeno raps, "Never
thought that it would happen this
way / After all that I did, never
thought that I'd be rappin one
day."
"Dedication" continues the
theme with Mad.ls.On "speakin'
in rhymes, actual facts written in
time." The song is a dedication to
all the heads who passed away in
the streets, to all the single moth
ers raising baby boys alone and to
all of those locked up (whether or
not they are physically in prison).
The song is a living documen
tary of the conditions facing
many on I larlem's streets - a city
described by Dame as having
" 18,000 vacant lots and not a sin
gle playground" and "where the
streets raise children more than
parents do." Dame Grease plans
to release a film documentary of

Harlem as a companion piece to
111 is new compact disc.
The low point of the album
comes in the second hall with a
string of songs that all sound too
similar. While Dame does an ex
cellent job on production (all hut
two songs were produced by
Dame, with J5 and Jewell/, ot Va
cant Lot producing the others)
with experimental beats on
"I'ressurer" and "Streets Done
Raised Us," songs like "Harlem
Niggas" and "(let Doe" miss the
mark entirely.
This album represents Dame
Grease returning to his neigh
borhood (he was raised in
Harlem from the age of four)
with <1 hip-hop vision lor the fu
ture. Merging the styles of plat
inum cats and street-corner
rhymers is an enormous task.
Dame has the ability to make
I)M\ and Nas (who rips a hole
through the track 15, "Wanna
Play Rough") sound as gritty as
they ever did, and to make
Meeno and Mad.ls.On sound
like established artists.
The future looks bright for
145 W. 129 th Street, dead center
in the heart of New York's leg
endary Harlem neighborhood.
Dame adds: "We did our share of
dirt in the lot, but now it's trans
formed into keeping that dirt
feeling in the music. Vacant Lot is
like the land of opportunity -
what you do with it is solely up to
you."

The album blasts oil bla/iu' with three bangin'
joints. "The Future," featuring DMX, liig Stan and
Meeno, opens up with street sounds, sirens, the
sounds of mass protests and news reporters' voices
trying to describe what's about to be dropped on
I larlem.

"Nigga Haters" is a
glimpse of what we can ex
pect 011 Scai I.ice's new
album, "The Last of a Dying
Breed." Kate is still spilling
his street knowledge and he
seems rejuvenated working
with new artists like lieanie
Sigel as well as some Vacant

Lot signees. The next track is a solo joint by Vacant
Lot's Memo, "I'm That Nigga." Meeno Ilexes his
skills with an ill How that's hoth humorous and seri
ons. Rapping with a distinct voice, he also flips dis
tinct rhymes. He'll have everybody remembering
those three words: "I'm Thaaat Niggaaaa.
The album's high points come right in the mid
dle of the album with track eight, "Never Thought,"
(featuring Tony Wink, Meeno and Baby Madison)

"A producer who can rap and control the maestro."
and nine, "Dedication," (featur
ing Mad. Is. On). "Never
Thought" is a glimpse into the
struggles each rapper had to fat e
while coining up in the game.
Tony Winks drops a powerful
rhyme: "Even though 1 got a
deal, I still hustle in the rain /
Fuck fame, these cold streets run
through my veins / Like a AIDS
infected baby born addicted to
cain. Lookin' back on the years,
like the streets ain't changed."
The song has a reflective, remi
niscent feel. Meeno raps, "Never
thought that it would happen this
way / After all that I did, never
thought that I'd be rappin one
day."
"Dedication" continues the
theme with Mad.ls.On "speakin'
in rhymes, actual facts written in
time." The song is a dedication to
all the heads who passed away in
the streets, to all the single moth
ers raising baby boys alone and to
all of those locked up (whether or
not they are physically in prison).
The song is a living documen
tary of the conditions facing
many on I larlem's streets - a city
described by Dame as having
" 18,000 vacant lots and not a sin
gle playground" and "where the
streets raise children more than
parents do." Dame Grease plans
to release a film documentary of

Harlem as a companion piece to
111 is new compact disc.
The low point of the album
comes in the second hall with a
string of songs that all sound too
similar. While Dame does an ex
cellent job on production (all hut
two songs were produced by
Dame, with J5 and Jewell/, ot Va
cant Lot producing the others)
with experimental beats on
"I'ressurer" and "Streets Done
Raised Us," songs like "Harlem
Niggas" and "(let Doe" miss the
mark entirely.
This album represents Dame
Grease returning to his neigh
borhood (he was raised in
Harlem from the age of four)
with <1 hip-hop vision lor the fu
ture. Merging the styles of plat
inum cats and street-corner
rhymers is an enormous task.
Dame has the ability to make
I)M\ and Nas (who rips a hole
through the track 15, "Wanna
Play Rough") sound as gritty as
they ever did, and to make
Meeno and Mad.ls.On sound
like established artists.
The future looks bright for
145 W. 129 th Street, dead center
in the heart of New York's leg
endary Harlem neighborhood.
Dame adds: "We did our share of
dirt in the lot, but now it's trans
formed into keeping that dirt
feeling in the music. Vacant Lot is
like the land of opportunity -
what you do with it is solely up to
you."
