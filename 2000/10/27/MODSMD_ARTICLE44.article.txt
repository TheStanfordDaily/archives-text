# MUSIC REVIEW
## SF Symphony performance lacks usual vitality 
### TIFFANY LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Renowned for their ethereal
playing and brilliant sound, the San
Francisco Symphony gave a perfor
mance last Friday that was slightly
short of walking on air and, in gen
eral, lacked some of the vitality and
cohesiveness they usually exhibit in
performance.
As the lights dimmed in the
magnificent glass-walled Davies
Symphony Hall, the crowd
hushed in eager anticipation of
Mark Wigglesworth, the guest
conductor of the evening. A grad
uate of the Royal Academy of
Music in London, Wigglesworth
has guest-conducted some of the

leading orchestras in the world,
including the New York Philhar
monic, the Los Angeles Philhar
monic and the BBC Symphony
()rt hestra.

signifying the first downbeat of
the night, the performance began
with a San Francisco Symphony
debut: Haydn's "Symphony No.
74," one ol the least performed of
his 104 symphonies. Written in

1780, the piece reflects the metic
ulous and boxy style common in
the Baroque era. The addition of
a keyboard, not as a solo instru
ment but as part of the orchestra,
wedged in between the cellos and
the violas, added an interesting
spin to the piece.
Although the composition itself
was decent, the symphony mem
bers were ever so slightly out of sync
with each other. The keyboard was
slightly ahead of the strings and (lu
strings slight 1\ ahead of the rest of
the orchestra. Also, many of the
quick, many-noted passages were
not as dearly articulated as they
should have been, which created a
slightly hazy sound.
The peak of the concert did not
arrive, as expected, with

Shostakovich's "1953 Symphony
No. I()in K minor," a contemporary
piece musically reflecting the lift*
and times of Stalin that was played
with both energy and monotony.
Instead the orchestra reached a cli
max during the middle piece: Brit
ten's "Four Sea Interludes."
This piece was by far the best
pet limned and the most interesting
of the three works. Written to intro
duce, separate and connect the var
ious parts of the "Peter Grimes"
opera, each of the four interludes
paints a diflerent picture.
The first "Sea Interlude" con
tains the haunting, high-pitched
melodies of the Mute and violin
ringing in the "Dawn," the theme
ol the interlude. The fluttering
harp and clarinet arpeggios are

reminiscent of birds awakening to
tlie morn.
I lie second interlude, "Snnda\
Morning," greets the listener with
heavy church bells ringing
throughout the piece, calling peo
ple to church. Alter invoking rest
and worship, the third interlude
softens the scene with low cellos and
basses calming the day down to
"Moonlight." But a great piece can
not end in tranquillity, so the Iburth
part finishes oil the series with the
wild .ind uncontrollable "Storm" in
terlude, ending the piece with a bril
liant flourish of sound.
Although the concert as .1 whole
left something to be desired, the
Symphony put 011 a wonderful
show, with ama/ing sound and
artistic flourish.
