# MOVIE REVIEW
## Radiant cast overshadowed by absurd screenplay Unbelievable plot twists include Bon Jovi acting and Jay Mohr as a nice guy 
### RAMIN SETOODEH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Oh, what a shame. "Pay it for
ward" shines with isles ol perfec
tion but suffocates under a
screenplay that drowns in an
ocean of absurdity.
()li, what a cast. Kevin Spacey,
Helen Hunt and Hale) Joel Os
ment all radiate a stalwart on
screen presence in some of the
most striking performances ol the
year. I'ogether, they've snatched
four Oscar nominations and
three wins. Put them all in one
movie, and — presto — a real
winner, right?
Not necessarily.
"Pay it Forward" staggers
through a sappy storyline that
plays like a Hallmark card ad
dressed to the entire human race,
(iranted, it begins with an in
triguing premise. A real cutesy
seventh grader named Trevor
(Osment) is inspired one day

when his teacher, Mr. Simonet
(Spacey), assigns the class to
"think of an idea to change the
world and put it into action."
And before you can say "I see
dead people," innocent I'revor is
off saving the planet. . .by bring
ing <i homeless man into his living
room to share some quality time.
Never mind that, in the real
world, homeless people don't
chow down on milk and cereal
with eleven-year-old boys.
We're supposed to swoon over
Trevor's idealism, for he really be
lieves this simple act will make a
difference.
You see, he's got this cockeyed
idea: He'll help three people,
change their lives and then the\ II
"pay it forward" by helping three
other people. Pretty soon, the
whole human race will be awfully
happy, and everyone will be help
ing everyone, like the fanner
family on "Full I louse."
()kay. So we get the point. The
only problem is, "Pay it Forward"

actually believes Trevor's idea will
work. In fact, a great deal ol the
storyline depends on it.
Pretty soon, there's a drug
dealer saving a woman from com
mitting suic ide, a gang member
who helps a girl with chronic asth
ma and a whole bunch of other
wise mean people doing nice
things.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.
Naturally, when Arlene (Hunt),
Trevor's mother, gets home from a
hard day's work at the strip club
(yes, she's a waitress who wears a
blue bra and matching lipstick)
sparks really lly. She runs into the
homeless man in her garage,
throws him out and gulps down

enough alcohol to book all the
mothers in the state ol (ieorgia in
the Betty Ford (llinic.
I hat's when I revc>i gets am>ther
idea and decides he'll "pav it for
ward" again by setting up Mr. Si
monet with his mom. They'll lall in
love, smoot hie booc hies and .ill w ill
be well in the world.
As if the screenplay didn't bite
off enough, there's .ilso an awful
subplot involving jay Mohr as a
struggling journalist who hears ol
the whole "pay it forward" move
ment and starts tracking the
story. What story, might you ask?
I cluiino. But Mohr interviews a
bunch of homeless people after
some rich guy gives him a free
Jaguar. Don't ask.
What makes "Pay ii Forward"
watc liable is the c harm ol its lead
ac tors and the strength ol i heir
performances. Helen Hunt is
very good as the single alcoholic
mother and ends up serving as
the glue that binds the movie to
gether. Spac ey, too, has some ad

miiahle moments ;11 <»111» with ()s
ment, who maimains his < harm
ing .screen persona despite the
hurly-burly of the stor\ line.
Then there's Jay Mohr. lake
note: Mohr should never, ever
play a character who isn't com
pletely reprehensible (think
"Jerry Maguire"). Here, he's sup
posed to play a good guy, but
never even conies dose to hitting
the right note.
Hut .it least lie's not as bad as
Jon Hon Jovi. Yes, the cluttered
screenplay (which is more top
heavy than one of those jumbo
sundaes at Haskin Robbius) even
manages to squeeze the New Jer
sey singer into the story.
The result? Horrendous. Hon
Jovi can't act. Not a bit. His lew
scenes with Ilelen I hint are han
dled in such an inept manner tli.it
it's like watching a tennis match
between Andre Agassi and Damn
DeVito.
"Pay it forward?" Somebody
needs to take Hon |ovi back.
