# INTERMISSION INTERVIEW
## Stanford student Jenn Lindsay sings her mind 
### DINA LEYETS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Senior Jennifer Lindsay gave
an enthusiastic solo at the Stan
lord Coffee House on Oct 13.
Steeped in folk tradition, Lindsay
offered the audience a thorough
sampling of her abilities both as
guitarist and songwriter, with
themes ranging from sweet to sav
age to celebratory.
The set primarily featured her
own music, along with several
cover breaks from Ani Difranco,
Simon and Garfunkel and Joni
Mitchell. She sarcastically de
scribes her own material as "songs
about springtime and lost love,"
but her music forays also include
feminist commentary, frustrations
with life at Stanford, body image is
sues and sexual assault.
Despite her cautionary com
ment at the start of the show —
"I'm new at this to have perfected
the art of clever inter-song banter,
so I'll just play" — a casual conver
sational style showed Lindsay very
much in her element. "I feel like I
should be getting everyone in the
mood for Full Moon on the Quad,
but you're all pretty mellow. So, in

stead, I'll sing a song about regret."
Intelligent, incisive lyrics per
vaded the performance. For ex
ample, her comments on a sexual
assault: "Wounds hit air and hard
en over a base of rage / Scared the
wound will wedge and friends w ill
disengage / Scared that people
understand first by taking aim / At
the ways I could have stopped the
folding of control/ And pretend ii
doesn't happen to a girl that you
could know / The bereaved can
not be grieved if the tales are
never told."
While many of her quieter
songs suffered 112 rom an amplifier
system only capable of reaching
the first few rows of seats, more
spirited tunes were carefully in
terspersed, allowing Lindsay to
maintain an overall energized
atmosphere.
Q: Has music always been an intu
itive form of expression for you?
A: Although I've been playing ca
sually since high school, I plunged
really enthusiastically into guitar
work a few years ago. My song writ
ing, though it was an interest since
early high school, only really
opened up while I was living in

Liverpool. I was gigging in these
sleazy little English taverns, in
front of British audiences who are
the most inattentive audiences
ever. They just sip their cider and
eat fish sandwiches and make
cheeky jokes while you sing.
It was a good place to begin be
cause nobody ever listened — so if
I fudged a song, big deal, nobody
heard. And in those taverns, for
me, pei lormances ceased to be
about vanity.
But once it became a very com
pelling pursuit for me, and perfor
mances became more about gen
erosity, it was hard to put out so
much effort, but receive no
warmth 112 rom the audience.
Q: Your generosity comes across
in the intensely personal quality of
your music. What sort of process
do you follow as a songwriter, and
bow do you feel about sharing so
much of yourself before a room full
of strangers?
A: When I first started writing
music, everything Mowed quickly
— I wrote about whatever I need
ed to deal with. But, as I've learned
to discern between worthy and
poor song material, and I've be

come far more demanding with
myself as far as what kind of sounds
I am putting together and how
much they can reach people out
side my slim frame of experience,
folk music becomes far more grati
fying.
I think that any pursuit be
comes more meaningful when it's
clearly important on a level outside
yourself— when you can look at
your life and say, "hey, this isn't
about me anymore." It's cathartic
on so many levels.
Q: What sort of responses have
you noticed to your music so far?
A: A lot of the songs in my reper
toire .ire really over-the-top ag
gressive mudslings. This is what
folks tell me. But they're just hon
est expressions of my own experi
ences. I think we spend a lot of time
at this school, in this country, danc
ing around what really digs at us,
playing this very stultifying "I'll
kiss your ass if you kiss mine"
game. So when I write about some
rough things that I have experi
enced in the past few years — some
controversial, sexy, painful, taboo
stuff — the only thing lam aiming
for is openness.

I can tell immediately if I write
a line that isn't honest — il it is too
defensive, or too enigmatic. If it
doesn't expose the most painful
stuff. Stuff 112 maybe couldn't put
on the table if I were just talking.
But singing to begin with is a very
visceral, draining thing — so lyri
cal honesty necessarily accompa
nies it.
Maybe my music will make
people uncomfortable. Maybe it
doesn't yet, but it's getting there.
Well, I find that kind of discom
fort so much more cathartic than
the flexing of facades we engage
in here.
Q: What are your immediate goals
as songwriter and musician?
A: Right now, I'm concentrating
on keeping the joy in my music, to
not be too uptight about the con
flict of my musical goals and doing
the Stanford thang. Since I've been
back I've been flooded with
enough intense emotions and in
teractions to fuel my writing. This
place does dish it out.
I .indsay will take center stage again
at the Coffee I louse again on Nov.
2, Nov. 22 and Dec. 15.
