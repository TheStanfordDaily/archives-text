Chocolate. Lollipops. Crazy par
lies that involve dancing on a tomb.
Yes, it's nearly Oct. 31 —almost that
time of year again.
I falloween alwavs manages to con
jure up images of witches and Power
Rangers walking door to door with
bright orange, plastic pumpkin pails,
but how does a college c ampus cele
brate tins night of the dead? Trust
Stanford students tocome up with in
novative ideas.
" This year, it's all about turquoise
spandex," sophomore Jennifer Hen
nings said. "Not only is turquoise
spandex a marvelouslv tacky tribute
to the '80s, but it also looks hilarious
with my fairy wings. What more
could 1 ask for in a costume?"

Expect to see some other wacky
things running around Tuesday as
well.
"1 aspire to be a big pink bunny,"
freshman Evan Kirby said.
Junior Karen Corby is wearing the
French maid costume she bought
lour years ago, while freshman (ihris
Edstrom is feeling a bit more political.
"I want to be Che Guevara be
cause lie's a political leader 1 look up
to and model my beliefs after,"
Edstrom said.
Some students are taking a more
comedic approach.
Freshman Samuel Lofland plans
to be a female vampire, complete with
fangs and fake breasts. He's not the
only one with transgender ideas.
"A Viking woman with long
blonde braids would be interesting,"
freshman Alexander Rosas said.
Dressing up is only one aspect of
the I lalloween experience. But being
a college student makes it harder to
carry out one of the holiday's main
traditions — trick-or-treating. For
those who have never stopped the
candy-begging tradition, hitting the
University level might be the end.
"I'll definitely miss going around
door to door and getting free candy
from neighbors," freshman Sage
Hyman said. "You really realize that
you're finally too old."
However, Stanford still tries to
bring this tradition to younger com
munity members.
Branner plans to host a Haunted
House for Barrio Assistance kids,
which will feature a variety of fun ac -
tivities and games. Residents will
hand out candy on the first two floors
and set up a haunted house on the
third floor.
As for other ghostly campus
events, the- annual Mausoleum Party
is always highly anticipated. Hun
dreds of Stanford students plan to
dance over Leland Stanford Jr.'s
grave tonight.
" fhe Mausoleum Party is the one
that everyone knows about," said se
nior Eric Silverberg. "It's the most
fun you'll have at a graveyard.
There's just something cathartic
about dancing on the graves of dead
Stanford people."

Last year, rapper Sir Mix-a-Lot
came to deejay t lie dance.
"There's good music:, a lot of peo
ple dressed tip and it's Inn," junior
Kdith I lo said.
So where did Halloween come
from, anyway? li started with an an
cient Celtic festival known as
Samhain (pronounced sow-in), that
marked the end of summer and the
start of winter, a lime olten associated
with death. ()n this night, the worlds
of the living and the dead became
one, so that ghosts returned to walk
the earth.
The "trie k-or-treating" tradition
evolved from early All Souls' Day pa
rades, during which poor beggars
would ask lot food. Patrons gave
them pastries known .is "soul cakes" if
they promised to pray for the pa
trons' deceased relatives.
Children eventually adopted this
practice and went around their
neighborhoods collecting ale, Ibod
and motiey.
Dressing up in costumes came
from ancient Kurope, when winter
was the most uncertain and frighten
ing season.
Peonle believed thev would meet

ghosts on Halloween, so they wore
masks to avoid recognition. They also
ltTi food outside their homes to please
the wandering spit its.
The practice of carving pumpkins
arose from an Irish legend about a
man named "Stingy Jack," who in
vited the Devil fora drink and
tricked him into promising not to
claim his soul.
After Jack died, God refused to
allow such an immoral character into
heaven, and the Devil refused him
entry into hell. He sent |ack back to
earth with only <i burning coal, which
Jack put into a carved-out turnip. He
has roamed the world ever since, and
people have immortalized his story in
jack o" lanterns.
Today, Halloween has evolved
into a much-loved tradition, full of
festivities, fun and sweets.
And if Stanlordites have a hard
time finding good costumes, they
can opt for freshman Spencer
Smith's idea.
"I'm going as a poor college stu
dent," he said. "Maybe someone will
put a scholarship or two into m\ trick
ot-treat bag along with the chocolate
•iiul candv."
