An Athletic
Event
Ever consider run
ning a marathon
every day? That
would take 55,000
strides daily, and
your body couldn't
do it. But when you
type 60 words a min
ute, your fingers pound out
21,600 strokes an hour. For your
fingers, that's like running a
marathon every two and a half
hours! No wonder computer
users get some aches and pains.
The Problem
When you work at your com
puter, small repetitive motions
cause minor trauma to delicate
muscles and tendons. With
prolonged computer use, nerve
damage may gradually accumu
late. Then boom - you've got a
problem - a repetitive strain
injury (RSI). Even simple daily
activities may become painful.
Symptoms
Pain, aching, tingling, fatigue
and/or numbness in fingers,
hands, wrists, arms, shoulders,
neck, back. Eyestrain; headache.
What to Do
■ Immediately stop the painful
activity (don't try to "work
through it" )
■ Try icing the painful areas,
and rest
■ If symptoms persist, see your
medical practitioner (prompt
treatment often results in full
recovery)
Prevention Tips
RSIs are easier to prevent than
to cure, so:
■ Use relaxed good posture
(don't hunch your shoulders
or sit rigidly - that cramps
muscles and knots your neck)
Look - desks with no computers!
In the '30s this Stanford student
gathered data in a more relaxed
(and economically obliiHous) way.
■ Stretch often to relax tight
muscles and improve blood
flow
■ Take breaks; move around at
least every 30 minutes
■ Relax hands, and keep wrists
in a neutral position
■ Hold the mouse lightly
■ Alternate thumbs on spacebar
■ Type gently; use as little force
as possible
■ Rest your eyes often, and get
them checked regularly
■ Fora more resilient body, pay
attention to your diet, exer
cise, and keep yourself well
hydrated
Your Workstation
Vou can get important benefits by
making some small, low-cost
changes. Here's how:
Your Chair
■ The seat should allow your
hips to be level with (or
slightly above) your knees;
padded, but not too soft
■ Full lower back support is best
(if needed, use a pillow or
| rolled towel for lower
back support)
; ■ Rest both feet flat
on floor (or use a
m footrest or a stack of
Sh telephone books)
■ Don't rest arms on
! arm-rests while typing
Keyboard
■ Position at lap level, or
slightly higher
■ Keep your shoulders relaxed
(not shrugged)
■ Upper arms should be
straight down, elbows at 90
degrees, and wrists straight
■ Don't strain fingers or bend
wrists sideways to reach keys
(move entire arm along
keyboard instead)
■ Use wrist pad only while
resting; do not use while
typing
Mouse
■ Should be close to keyboard,
and fit comfortably in cupped,
relaxed hand
Monitor
■ Place between 16" and 28"
from your eyes
■ Top of screen should be level
with your forehead; eyes
looking slight-ly downward
■ Make sure it's bright enough
to match ambient light
■ Avoid reflection, glare, and
screen flicker
■ Keep your work at eye level
(invest in a page holder)
Laptops
If you use a laptop, you prob
ably can't follow the recom
mendations above due to its
design. Try to avoid prolonged
use, and switch to a full-size
monitor and a docking station
(or a properly positioned
external keyboard connected to
your laptop so the laptop
monitor can be at eye level
whenever possible). Q
