U.S. Savings Bonds are gifts with a future. And when you give
them every year, they can make a real dent in someone's college
bills. With eight denominations to choose from, there's a size for
every wallet. And whether you choose the popular Series EE Bonds
or the inflation-protected I Bonds, your gift will grow safely until
that special person needs it.
Savings Bonds can be purchased through most local banks, where
you work, or automatically through the new Savings Bonds
Easy Saver Plan at www.easysaver.gov.
