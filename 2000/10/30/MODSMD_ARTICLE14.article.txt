## Moderate party claims win in Kosovo elections 
### 
PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) —
Buoyed by unofficial results, moderate
ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova
yesterday claimed victory for his party in
Kosovo's municipal elections and said his
goal for the province remains indepen
dence from Yugoslavia.
In its first comment on the vote, the of
fice of Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostu
nica said it was invalid because it applied
only to the province's ethnic Albanians.
Most of the remaining Serb minority in
Kosovo boycotted Saturday's elections.
Rugova's victory claim was based on fig
ures compiled by independent monitor
ing groups and his own party, the Demo
cratic League of Kosovo. Both showed his
parly winning the majority of votes in Sat
inday's elections — the first since NATO
bombing forced former Yugoslav leader
Slobodan Milosevic to pull out his troops in
June 1999, leaving Kosovo to be run by the
I nited Nations and NATO.
I he Kosovo Action for Civic Initiative,
an independent Kosovo elections moni
toring group, said Rugova's Democratic
League of Kosovo won a controlling ma
jority in the province's major cities, in
( hiding Pristina, the capital. Releasing its
own preliminary results, Rugova's party
said it had yvon about 68 percent of the
vote in Pristina and more than 50 percent
in other key cities.
Rugova's chief rival is Hashim Thaci, the
former head of the guerrilla Kosovo Liber
al ion Army, whose fight for the province's

independence led to the Milosevic crack
down that precipitated NATO bombing of
Yugoslavia. His party said it had not re
ceived any results. Ramus!) Haradinaj,
head of the third major party running, said
he would respect any official outcome.
Although Saturday's voting was for
seats on town and city councils, the results
are seen as a sign of how Rugova and
Thaci compare in popularity and how
well their parties would fare in any na
tional elections. Official preliminary re
sults are not expected before today, and
112 ull results are expected to be announced
within eight to 12 days.
In voting Saturday, hundreds of thou
sands of people chose members of munic
ipal councils from among more than
5,000 candidates. Each of the 20 political
parties — all of them ethnic Albanian —
claimed it was best prepared to bring
about independence from Yugoslavia.
The apparent triumph by Rugova's
party did nothing to eliminate the dilem
ma confronting the United States and its
allies — how to satisfy both the new, demo
cratic Yugoslav government, which wants
to keep a strong hold on Kosovo, and the
independence aspirations of Kosovo's es
timated 2 million ethnic Albanians.
Rugova is more moderate than his
chief rivals. But he shares their agenda of
independence for Kosovo, which still for
mally remains part of Serbia, Yugoslavia's
main republic, despite its more than 90
percent ethnic Albanian majority.
