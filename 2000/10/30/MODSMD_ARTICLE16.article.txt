closed-minded, but I'm having trouble

interesting and uninspiring an event
that it would lead someone to publicly

After all, m< >st of us
have deciclecl that war
is ,i bad thing, that the
wholesale killing of
people is inotalh un
acceptable. Some of us
have even decided
that the pre>cess ol tak
ing two steps forward,
one step back towards

a more peaceful world is iu fact a good
thing, that it's worth supporting incre
mental peace processes until the world
manages to adopt non-violence as a
guiding principle ol behavoir.
And, some disagree.
Apparently, they have a right to
"build character" by am means neces

it will make you a better person is not
quite the same as wanting to lost' a

I low elevated a self-opinion do you
have to possess to seriously think that
vour right to "character" develop

to have a little bit of peace, however
tenuous? There are mechanisms for
"self-improvement" that do not in
volve killing people en masse, wavs
that should be socially acceptable.
But we live in a society that glorifies
manliness in all ol its tonus. 1 lie myth that
'itWttdcrtotbecrmiea "real man." you must

weight — roughly proportional to tli.it of
an ammunition belt — with some people.
So, feeling distressed because tliev are the

prosperit\ and have missed their chance
to get lice ill I.uropean treiu lies, iliev are
in >w kit king small rot ks and saying, "Man,
1 need a war to light in."
Now, now, we shouldn't make fun of
these people. After all, they're victims of
an ideal ol mast ulinitv that has been con
strut ted over thousands ol veai s, an ideal
that — if you've been pa\ ing attention to
Susan Falutli, author of Stiffed, has not

been serving its constituents well lately.
As we should do our best to somehow a< -
commodate these people so that they
don't go oil'and start a war, we have two
options.
First, we could change our com eption
of masculinity. Men would have to stop
digging trenc lies and setting up machine
guns in their backyards, and women
would have to transfer the ideal ol the
"man it) uniform" from the naval ollicer
to the UPS man. It would allow fora
kinder, gentler construction of what n
means to be male. But since this socio-c ul
tural reconfiguration requires a whole lot
of effort, sa< i if ice and, most importantly,
time, I've come up with Flan B,a stopgap
measure that just might save lives: let's
bring war to Stanford.
