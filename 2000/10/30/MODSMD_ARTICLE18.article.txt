Indifference and contradictions fuel
Nader campaign
As the 2000 presidential elec lion enters
its final weeks, I find invsell ver\ dislui bed
bv the continuing candiclac\ ol Ralph
Nader. I hose in attendance' at Ralph
Nader's talk on Monda\ max remember
me as the gu\ in the tan shut who, some
what apologetically, asked Nader win 11 is

campaign was using a rotating batch ot
< oiitradictot) arguments to justify itself.
Regrettabh, Nader's gracious and elo
quent response sidestepped the question
altogether. I le spoke of 1 1is desire to gen
erate a grassroots progressive movement
and disavowed holding anv electoral
agenda, taking an agnostic stance on the
question ot how Ins candidac\ will ailed
the ultimate outcome.
I consider Nader's response to have
been a dodge. II Ralph Nader truh feels
agnostic about the cllect his caudidac\
will have 011 the ultimate outcome of the
election, ibis is a startling new develop
ment. At various points during the c am
paign. Nader has argued publicly: .1) that
the two parties ate virtually identical, b)
that bis c andid.icv would help the Demo
cratic parlv In turning out voters who
would vote for Democratic House candi
dates. c) that (lore was virtually assured of
\ u torv .uid d) that a Hush presidency was
needed to galvanize grassroots activists.
While a) is the traditional line of the
(ireen l\u t\, b), c) and d) seem geared to
cater to votet s who recognize that the two
parties are, in fact, quite different. This
tension between c onclemning the two par
lies . 1 s moral equivalents and recognizing
lb.(i the Democrats are the more liberal
partv was further illustrated when, scarce
l\ five minutes after Nader finished dis
missing \l (lore's progressive credentials,
bis (lalifornia c ampaign manager assured
the audience that the Democratic candi
date would cat tv the state.
S.idlv, in .ill the excitement, no one seemed
to notice that the (ireen Party was simultane
oush saving two very diflerent tilings.
Win all the sophistry? For Nader to
succeed, he must obtain votes from indi
viduals who want to see (lore defeat Bush.
For even solid (Ireen voter who despises
both parties, there is an ambivalent liberal
who has no desire to lac ilitate the election
of a Republic .111 candidate who does not
believe in global warming, affirmative ac
tion or a woman's right to choose.
Without tlu- support of such voters, the
Nader campaign would sink back into
electoral ohsc 111 it\. For this reason, Nader
has feigned blindness on the issue of his

campaign's impact on the main race, while
pursuing a pec uliar vendetta against the
Democratic Party.
Nader's campaign strategy seems
geared toward wrecking A1 (iore. Both he
and Pat Buchanan are scrambling to ralh
live percent of the voting public in order
to (|ualif\ for federal funds in 2004. What
is peculiar is the way that Nader is going
about it. The Reform Party candidate is
sensibh looking for votes in states where
I he winner is already clear.
Nader, on the other hand, has chosen to
campaign in states where the race is tight,
and the outcome will be decided by a nar
row margin. He has generally targeted
swing states that Gore needs to win. This
policy lias upset a number of his longtime
friends, who feel that he is deliberated lt \
ing to swing the election to Bush and that he
has violated .1 promise to his supporters that
he would avoid campaigning in swing states.
Obviously, I was not in the room when
Nader allegedly made this promise. In
light of his willingness to say very different
things to different groups, I find the
charge highly plausible.
Why has Nader apparently broken a
promise to old friends? Ultimately, he is
running because of the scorn lie feels to
ward the Democratic Party and its candi
date. To him, Al (iore is not simply a more
moderate candidate.
Nader's case against the vice president is
based on a character assessment far harsher
than anything (ieorge W. Bush or Dick ( li
eney would dare to utter. Nader has called
(iore a "coward" and a "tec lino-twit," disap
pointing words from a man who wants to
raise the character of American politics. I lis
contempt for (iore has led to wild misrepre
sentations of the vice president's record.
Contrary to Nader's assertions, (iore
lias led initiatives to promote the use <>l
solar energy, helped negotiate the Kyoto
I reaty on global warming and champi
oned new energy efficiency standards. I le
plans to spend over $ 170 billion on the en
vironment. When one considers the warm
and fuzzy relationship (iovernor Bush en ■
joys with the oil industry, Nader's claim <>l
equivalency between the parties seems
downright delusional.
What does Nader, himself, reallv be
lieve about the two parties? Ihe question
is interesting, but not nearly as relevant as
the issue o! whether we should believe him
w lieu he < laims that lie is indifferent to the
immediate electoral impact of his candida
cy . I lie 2000 election will shape the politi
cal landscape for decades. Mativ votes w ill
be decided b\ parly lo\altv, personality or
sheei ignorance. I hoseol uswhopioudK
vote on the issues should think carefully
before we sacrifice the causes we care
about on the altai of Ralph Nader's vin
dictive and misguided < i usade.

Ad displays anti-Israel bias
As Jews and sensible people, we were
hurl In an ad in Wednesday's Daily. The
ad displayed the gunning down of 12
year-old Mohammed Al-Durah in a gun
battle between Palestinian police and Is
raeli Defense Forces. The incident was a
genuine tragedv. But n is appalling that it
is being used as a propagandist tool to hal -
low the Palestinian cause and paint the
IDF as a child-killing mob.
I he image depicted father and son
Imcldled against a wall, caught in a i allv of
Israeli and Palestinian fire. It is being
used, however, to symbolize the domina
tion of an unarmed Palestinian population
by a brutal occupying Israeli force.
Israel does not want to be an occupying
presence. To t liis day, public opinion polls
indicate that Israelis still want to see the cre
ation of a Palestinian state. 'I'hat was the goal
of the seven-year ()slo peace proc ess. which
was predicated on a framework for the
gradual ceding of land for reciprocal
promises of peace. Israel's willingness to see
the creation of a Palestinian state is evi
denced In the dramatic steps [Israeli Prime
Minister Fluid) Barak took towards I hat end
in the most recent ('amp David peace talks.
Israel has nothing to gain from ibis vio
lence Israel wants peace, and even in
these disparaging times, lias taken
thoughtful steps to minimize the nunibci
of pec>ple killed. Israeli troops have shown
restraint b\ not firing at mobs of stone
throwers. Instead, the\ reserve live fire as
retaliation for live fire.
The snipers mentioned in the ad do not
pick out defenseless < hildren. They pick out
the armed individuals firing from their
midst at Israeli guards and civilians. Heavy
weapons such as tanks aie used specifically
to discourage the use of automatic- weapons,
and the Palestinian ambulances mentioned
have been used to fei iv guns and firebombs
into flash points. Many of the armaments
used in Palestinian instigations were given
to them by Israel for police-use as part of the
earlier peace ac cords
I he corresponding public relations war
fare waged by the leadership of both sides
has been even more damaging than the
popular violence. Palestinians have effec
tively used images like the one in Wednes
day's advertisement to vilify Israel. Israel
also lias hurtful images such as 11 )F soldiers
beaten, murdered and mutilated by gleeful
mobs cheering "(Joel is great.'
Neither side is blameless. I lie violence
has c lit both ways. We are all incensed. We
are all hurt. We all feel threatened. Clear
ly we understand the need to tell the story
as we see it. Wednesday's acl was particu
larly evocative, but also clearly biased and
didn't tell the yvhole story. Stanford Stu
dents should be able to recognize it for
what it yvas — propaganda. I hey should
be given enough information to assess the
situation foi themselves. Inc iclents like the
one depicted in the ad are tragic but so is
propaganda that uses tlieni as political
tools to perpetuate hate and misunder
standing. Unfortunately that is what this
conflict has been all about.

I All (iOLAN
Soplwiiwir, I ad ft It/ifil
JOSH SAIDOKI-
Junior, I nritrlared
Ad misrepresented the facts of Mideast
conflict
I am writing in response to the adver
tisement that appeared in The Daily on
Wednesday, Oct. 25. The advertisement
depicted the- tragic incident that occurred
on Sept. 30 in which a 12-year old Pales
tinian boy was killed by Israeli gun lire.
First, 1 would like to state that I believe
that this was a horrible and tragic event,
l he fact that so many minors have been
killed or injured in the course of the last
four yveeks also is a tragedy.
l he advertisement implies by its head
line, "You i 1 ax Dollars At Work," that the
United States, in giving aid and arms to Is
rael. is supporting the killing of children.
At the bottom of the page is a tally of the
"Casualties of Peace ': Palestinians — 137.
I si ,ielis — 9.
I'lie implication that the Israeli Defense
Forces are deliberately targeting civilians,
and specific ally children, is contradic tory to
everything that we have seen thus far. In
any wide-scale action taken In the IDF in re
sponse to acts ol violence initiated bv Pales
tinian gunmen, the IDF has taken specific
precautions to warn civilian Palestinians to
evacuate those areas that would be targeted.
The response of the IDF to at least two
events, namely the brutal slaving of two Is
raeli reservists by a Palestinian mob .it Ra
mallali and the shooting of (Jilo homes by
Palestinians from the neighboring West
Bank village of Beit Jallah, bears this out. In
both of these instances, the 11)1 warned
civilian populations that the buildings used
to commit those deeds yvould be destroyed.
While one may argue that these are
civilian buildings and should not be tar
geted by the 11)F, the fact that a particular
site is used as a base for armed attack con
verts that site to a strategic military target.
Flie IDF has been under tremendous
pressure to exercise restraint and mini
mize furthei loss of life. Asa result, the I DF
yvas forced to let an Israeli soldier bleed to
death .it Joseph's Tomb rather than going
through acrcnvd of civilians to resc lie him.
()nc e Joseph's Fonib was evacuated In the
IDF, these civilians destroyed the tomb,
burned the Jewish books and sc rolls that
were there, and are now rebuilding that
site as a Mosque.
In an extremely explosive situation, the
Israeli army is trying to use the maximum
amount of restraint possible while simulta
neously trying to ensure adequate protec
tion lot itself and foi Israeli citizens. 1 find it
inconceivable that anyone expects soldiers
who are shot at with live ammunition not to
let inn fire. In fact, the IDF returns lire only
when the soldiers can identify the source.
None of this exc uses the killing of civil
ians by armed soldiers. However, let's be
clear, the IDF does not intend to kill Illi
nois. Israeli soldiers are not targeting ( hil
dren. The fact that minors are being killed
is the consequence ol social attitudes
which hold that dying to fiee Palestine
from Israeli occupation is a noble and
worthyvhile cause.
An Associated Press story that ran on
Oct. 25 describes that very attitude by a
ninth grade Palestinian boy who said, "ev
eryone wants to be a shaheeel [a martyr for
Palestine]. It's the best thing a person
could do." Is it so surprising that young
people yvith these beliefs find themselves
in the line of fire?
More shocking than the fact that these
young boys are encouraged In their lead
ers. radio stations and communities to par
ticipate in the lighting, is the fact that the
deaths of these c hildren are being used .is
a public relations tool. In contrast, yvlien
the Israeli soldiers were killed, beaten and
mutilated, the photos of their bodies were
not splashed all over newspapers out of re
spect for the soldiers and their families.
Finally, I wish to respond to the state
ment that the "Casualties of Peace" are
137 Palestinians. I hey are not c asualties of

peace. Rather, they are casualties of [Pales
tinian Authority Yassar] Arafat's unwill
ingness or inability to accept the best deal
the Palestinians could possibly have been
offered by the first Israeli Prime Minister
elec ted specifically on a platform of peace
with the Palestinians.
At Camp David, Ehud Barak was willing
to effectively withdraw from all the West
Hank and (laza strip as well as from parts of
Kast Jerusalem. Barak was even willing to
discuss the right of return of Palestinian
tefugees to Israel proper. As a result, he is
now fighting for his political life. These 137
Palestinians are not casualties of peace.
I hey are casualties of their own leaders'
short-sightedness, inability to compromise
and apparent lack of willingness for peace.
In spite of all this. I remain cautiously
hopeful about the possibility for peace in
the Middle Kast. I his is a region of the
world where people of all religions and
backgrounds should be working together
to build «i better world lot themselves and
their children. I truly hope that such a
world will come to pass soon.

MSAN's display counter-productive
I he Muslim Students Awareness Net
work's anti-Israel display in White Plaza
simply stated the death tolls for each side,
seeming to imply that the Palestinians who
have been killed are the only victims. The
truth is iliat there are victims on both sides.
Israeli towns have come under attack from
Palestinian mobs. Soldiers have fired onlv as
much as is absolutely needed to disperse the
crowd and protect the civilians.
MSAN failed to disc uss the events sur
rounding the deaths. The fact that there are
more Palestinian deaths than Israeli ones
does not mean that the Israelis are the ag
gressors and the Palestinians are all inno
(cut victims. With this display and last May's
clisplav (which depicted Palestinian towns as
tombstones), MSAN lias been quick to de
monize Israel, yet we have never heard
them speak out against Palestinian bomb at
tacks on Israeli civilians.
If MSAN truly desires to promote peace
lather than anger, they must provide a
more balanced perspective in the future.
There niusi be less of a focus on death
counts and finger pointing, and instead a
dedication to the exchange of ideas. I ntil
MSAN makes these changes, we must ques
tion their commitment to real peace.

Stanford's Foothills stance hypocritical
As a Stanford alumnus still living in the
area who frequently enjoys the Foothills, I
have been keeping a careful eye on the
progress of Stanford's development plan
over the past year. Clearly, there is a lot at
stake in this plan lor the administration, the
community and the students.
I understand the pressures on the ad
ministration to support the growth of
housing and academic facilities. I also un
derstand John Hennessy's point that no
one will be able to predict the needs and
uses of the land in another century. Yet,
regardless of the turns and unpredictable
changes that Stanford and the whole Bay
Area will take in the next century, open
space will continue to be at risk and in
need of preservation.
I lennessy and the administration claim
that open space is a core tenet of Stanford's
c harter and values and that preserving the
Foothills is a priority. If this is the case,
they should welcome a 99-year dedication
of open space, if not veto such a dedication
in favor of permanent protection of the
Foothills. The administration's fierce re
sistance to either of these options truly
frightens me as I feel it exposes a consid
erable hypocrisy.

As a Stanford student, the Dish area of
the Foothills was my home. I went there
for peace, comfort, breath, companion
ship, solitude, sunshine, earth, energy and
exercise. I went there to watch the sunset,
to stargaze and for midnight runs after
studying hard.
It is a place I shared with many friends
and a place I felt was mine. Over the past
several weeks, I have spoken with countless
friends and classmates about the c hanges oc
curring at the Dish. For all of them, the Dish
played a similar role in their Stanford expe
rience and .ill of them feel sadness at the loss
of a place they still treasure.
I cannot look at the new pavement on
the Dish path and believe that the Univer
sity sincerely believes it is doing the best
thing for the environment. Nor can I look
at the fence and the restrictive hours and
believe that it has the students best interest
in mind while distancing them from the
heart and soul of its campus.
I believe that the administration must not
understand the immeasurable value of the
Foothills. In truth, they were the reason that
I came to Stanford and the reason that I
stayed. And they add an immeasurable qual
ity of life to the student experience, a quali
ty that leaves any kind of academic building
or program in the dust.
1 was very pleased to hear that Simitian
recommended a 99-year dedication of
open space in return for development. I
urge you all to follow in that direction and
not give in to Stanford's every wish. I be
lieve t}i<tt there are countless ways for the
University to be creative with its needs and
work within the current academic bound
ary. After all, it has far more land than
most other major universities. Stanford
could in fact become a leader in innovative
urban planning, something this whole
country needs badly.
In summary, I applaud Mr. Simitian's
recommendations and very much hope
that they will be accepted into the final de
velopment plan for Stanford. Permanent
space for the Foothills and unrestricted ac
cess to them for students and community
members are vital to the health and life of
the Stanford community.

Land use plan needs a build-out limit
I am a Stanford neighbor and former
student, concerned about Stanford's ap
parent desire for intensive development
over the next 10 years and longer. I have
been involved with the public/communi
ty aspects of Stanford's General Use Per
mit/Environmental Impact Report over
the last year or so.
First, 1 would like to ac knowledge Stan
ford's generous sharing of facilities and
space with the surrounding communities
and that Sum ford is currently and will
hopefully continue to be a jewel in the Sil
icon Valley crown of enlightened technol
ogy. I also applaud their contributions to
society through education and research.
That said, we are reaching the end of the
[planning) process. I have heard Supervisor
Joe Simitian's position on the plan and am
largely supportive of his recommendations,
but want to raise two issues.
First, Stanford President Henry recent
ly stated that Simitian's proposal man
dates a 99-year dedication of one-quarter
of our Santa Clara County lands to open
space and that he finds this "unaccept
able." I think this speaks volumes about
Stanford's intent for those lands. (loupled
with Stanford's lack of any indication of a
"build out limit," it seems that they intend
to build in the open space.
Second, the urgency attached to getting
this proposal approved immediately is un
warranted: Stanford has many develop
ment projects in progress and planning
stages that should keep them busy while the
long-term is examined in closer detail. Joe
Simitian proposed developing / approving
the build-out plan in tandem with the next
10 years of Stanford development.
Instead, I propose that the build-out
plan be negotiated and agreed upon now.

while this enormous expansion of Stan
ford facilities is on the table — even if that
means a delav in Stanford's ambitious ex
pansion plans. In view of their apparent
intent to build in the open spate, this
seems like a prudent measure to me.
Although Mr. Simitian's analysis of the
increased need for housing does address the
direct impact of Stanford's increased devel
opment for staff and students, it neglects the
indirect impacts on local resources, i.e.
housing, traffic and increased density.
At the stated levels of development,
there will be a new, semi-permanent crew
of construction, infrastructure and other
support personnel in the Stanford vicinity,
with associated housing, road and traffic
disruptions. This is another important
part of the impact that begs for mitigation.
I don't need to dwell on the already
crowded Peninsula conditions and hous
ing market; those who live here are al
ready well aware.
I would like to request that the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors require that
continued Stanford development occurs
only along with a corresponding require
ment for some amount of permanent open
space dedication. Our community values
open space, habitat preservation and com
pact development, not sprawl. Support these
values, and include a requirement that both
encourages Stanford to develop compactly
and gradually results in permanent open
space protection.
Finally, I would like to express support
for the statements of Palo Alto Planning de
partment spokesman, Ed Gawf, on Monday
Oct. 16 in the Palo Alto City Council Cham
ber. Align the academic growth boundary
with Junipero Sena Blvd. and require
major amendment the Santa Clara county
General plan. Require 25-year or perma
nent open space protection for this space.
Hold Stanford to a "no new-net-commute
trips" policy. And, further, require Stanford
to provide public access to the open space,
and accept public input into the open space
use planning process.

Stanford's development hurts quality of
community life
Natural areas all around us are being
covered with concrete or are otherwise
being "developed" at an alarming rate. In
my opinion, this trend reduces the quality of
life for us all now and generations to come.
What is to be gained from this addi
tional development at Stanford? Will the
people who run Stanford look better or
somehow feel better every time a new
building is built and more open space is
lost? Does this result in an increase in pres
tige for them? What about myself , my fam
ily and my friends? Are we to accept a re
duction in the quality of our lives now and
in the future so that the people who run
Stanford can advance their careers?
I am glad that our city council voted to
recommend permanent open space protec
tion. 1 am very thankful that there are many
people in our community fighting hard for
permanent protection of open space in the
Stanford Foothills. Let's use some sense,
plan for the future and place limits on de
velopment in order to preserve this com
munity and our quality of life.
