Indifference and contradictions fuel
Nader campaign
As the 2000 presidential elec lion enters
its final weeks, I find invsell ver\ dislui bed
bv the continuing candiclac\ ol Ralph
Nader. I hose in attendance' at Ralph
Nader's talk on Monda\ max remember
me as the gu\ in the tan shut who, some
what apologetically, asked Nader win 11 is

campaign was using a rotating batch ot
< oiitradictot) arguments to justify itself.
Regrettabh, Nader's gracious and elo
quent response sidestepped the question
altogether. I le spoke of 1 1is desire to gen
erate a grassroots progressive movement
and disavowed holding anv electoral
agenda, taking an agnostic stance on the
question ot how Ins candidac\ will ailed
the ultimate outcome.
I consider Nader's response to have
been a dodge. II Ralph Nader truh feels
agnostic about the cllect his caudidac\
will have 011 the ultimate outcome of the
election, ibis is a startling new develop
ment. At various points during the c am
paign. Nader has argued publicly: .1) that
the two parties ate virtually identical, b)
that bis c andid.icv would help the Demo
cratic parlv In turning out voters who
would vote for Democratic House candi
dates. c) that (lore was virtually assured of
\ u torv .uid d) that a Hush presidency was
needed to galvanize grassroots activists.
While a) is the traditional line of the
(ireen l\u t\, b), c) and d) seem geared to
cater to votet s who recognize that the two
parties are, in fact, quite different. This
tension between c onclemning the two par
lies . 1 s moral equivalents and recognizing
lb.(i the Democrats are the more liberal
partv was further illustrated when, scarce
l\ five minutes after Nader finished dis
missing \l (lore's progressive credentials,
bis (lalifornia c ampaign manager assured
the audience that the Democratic candi
date would cat tv the state.
S.idlv, in .ill the excitement, no one seemed
to notice that the (ireen Party was simultane
oush saving two very diflerent tilings.
Win all the sophistry? For Nader to
succeed, he must obtain votes from indi
viduals who want to see (lore defeat Bush.
For even solid (Ireen voter who despises
both parties, there is an ambivalent liberal
who has no desire to lac ilitate the election
of a Republic .111 candidate who does not
believe in global warming, affirmative ac
tion or a woman's right to choose.
Without tlu- support of such voters, the
Nader campaign would sink back into
electoral ohsc 111 it\. For this reason, Nader
has feigned blindness on the issue of his

campaign's impact on the main race, while
pursuing a pec uliar vendetta against the
Democratic Party.
Nader's campaign strategy seems
geared toward wrecking A1 (iore. Both he
and Pat Buchanan are scrambling to ralh
live percent of the voting public in order
to (|ualif\ for federal funds in 2004. What
is peculiar is the way that Nader is going
about it. The Reform Party candidate is
sensibh looking for votes in states where
I he winner is already clear.
Nader, on the other hand, has chosen to
campaign in states where the race is tight,
and the outcome will be decided by a nar
row margin. He has generally targeted
swing states that Gore needs to win. This
policy lias upset a number of his longtime
friends, who feel that he is deliberated lt \
ing to swing the election to Bush and that he
has violated .1 promise to his supporters that
he would avoid campaigning in swing states.
Obviously, I was not in the room when
Nader allegedly made this promise. In
light of his willingness to say very different
things to different groups, I find the
charge highly plausible.
Why has Nader apparently broken a
promise to old friends? Ultimately, he is
running because of the scorn lie feels to
ward the Democratic Party and its candi
date. To him, Al (iore is not simply a more
moderate candidate.
Nader's case against the vice president is
based on a character assessment far harsher
than anything (ieorge W. Bush or Dick ( li
eney would dare to utter. Nader has called
(iore a "coward" and a "tec lino-twit," disap
pointing words from a man who wants to
raise the character of American politics. I lis
contempt for (iore has led to wild misrepre
sentations of the vice president's record.
Contrary to Nader's assertions, (iore
lias led initiatives to promote the use <>l
solar energy, helped negotiate the Kyoto
I reaty on global warming and champi
oned new energy efficiency standards. I le
plans to spend over $ 170 billion on the en
vironment. When one considers the warm
and fuzzy relationship (iovernor Bush en ■
joys with the oil industry, Nader's claim <>l
