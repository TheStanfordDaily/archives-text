# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Work smarter, not harder and don't tolerate bad teaching 
### GEORGE NAUGLES GUEST COLUMNIST 
I graduated from Stanford in 198H,
Civil Engineering. I generally
worked too much and socialized too
little. 1 want to encourage under
graduates to recognize th.it relationships
are just as important as academic results.
I am sorry that 1 worked as hard as I did
at a< ademics while neglec ting every inter
pei sonal relationship.
Let's just imagine that I had the
< ham e to do it .ill over again. What
would 1 do differently? For starters, I'd
take one-half to one full clay ofT each
weekend to go on outings with friends
and/or attend a < hurc h or club in one of
the local communities. I would take 12

to I f> units beginning from the very first
clay of c lass — instead of 1 H per quarter,
waffling until the absolute add / drop
deadline.
1 would make time for eight hours of
sleep every night, instead of five. I
would take out more student loans in
stead of working 20 hours per week
during the quarters, 12 hours a day on
bi eak and (Christmas and 15 hours a clay
during the summer.
I would challenge the financial aid of
fice to re-review my aid application to give
me more aid in light of the fact that nei
ther of my parents are contributing any
money. I would stay current with and, if
possible, ahead of my c lasses and be part
of study groups — instead of getting ex
hausted, falling behind, feeling ashamed

and isolated and then having to work
twice as hard to solve even tiling myself.
Rathci than punishing myself with
more study bouts, I would try to gc-t
away for an how s bike ride every other
clay so that I c an woi k faster afterward.
Rather than increase mv work load so
that I can boast about what I am doing,
I would cut back to make sure I was
building a solid foundation for future
courses.
If only I had another c lianc e, . . . but
life doesn't work that way. We live with
our c hoices.
In reality, I felt so much pressure
about money that all of these ideas just
did not seem feasible to me as an wider
graduate. In retrospect, I believe they
were feasible options.

I was just too foolish to choose them.
In the end I did okay, made a few As, +'s,
and of course, graduated, but I could
have done so much better and been so
mile 11 happier had I made better ( hoices.
I hope that you will make better
choices than I did. Prioritize as well as
you (an, in a balanced way, and cut out
the extra courses as early as you can.
You will more likel\ benefit from college
buddies in your c areer than from specif
ic course content. Learn to choose the
jewel of a friend as well as the- jewel of a
course. Work hard at feeling good so
you c an be more efficient and more so
ciable.
Oh, and one more thing: Don't toler
ate being taught In Teaching Assistants
and professors who speak poor English,

teach poorly or conduct department
business during office hours. More peo
ple need to complain about this kind ol
problem or it will continue to under
mine the quality of the Stanford educa
tion. You are paying too much to receive
substandard teaching, so speak out in .is
organized a fashion as you can.
Why should you have to work twice .is
hard just because your well-paid profes
sor hasn t made teaching his or her first
priority? Your communication in this
regard may be most effective when di
rected toward the ombudsperson, the
department heads and the president's
office.
Good luck at working smart.
