animals.
The station's leaders said they
held the open house in ()c tober to
avoid the tourist season and to en
courage local residents to attend.
Fall quarter is also the "off quar
ter for the station, and with fewer
students around, faculty members
can focus their attention on activi
ties besides ( lasses.
The faculty members set up a
table at the open house to demon
strate their research. Assisted In
graduate students, the faculty also
spoke about their research, using
computer presentations and
posters to convey their ideas.
In addition, fatuity presented
half-hour lectures in which tliev
spoke about station-related topics
such as tracking blue tuna and
global warming.
I he event also included "The
Bine Revolution," a video pro
duced In the Stanford News Ser

vice about the station and a slide
show 011 the station's history.
Several interactive demonstra
tions drew large crowds, according
to center librarian Joe W'ible, the
event's coordinator. While two
tuna feedings were originalh
scheduled, an extra feeding was
added I<> s;iiisi\ public .demand.
I he last open house, held in
1992, celebrated the 100 th an
niversary of the station.
