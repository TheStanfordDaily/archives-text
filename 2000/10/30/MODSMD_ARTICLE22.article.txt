### JULIE HILL 
Mohan Venkatachalam, an assistant profesor oi
accounting ai tlit' (iraduate School oi Business,
concluded that Web site traflic most helped to de
termine a compam s market value in a recently re
leased stud\,
He and his partners from the I niversit\ of
Wi ishington School of Business Administration
studied <S ( .) acquisitions In Internet-oriented com
panies in I 999 ,md the first quarter ol 2000 to dis
coyer the la< tors driving the high values of Internet
slocks.
Venkatachalam found that the average market
value ol the< ompanies he studied was $700 per vis
itor. oi "eyeball.' Without Yahoo, the mat ket value
of those companies he studied dropped to $.'Mf> per
eyeball.
Iwen though the price per eyeball has dropped
dramatic all) situ e the April slot k mat ket clip, traf
fic was the determining component of an Internet
compam s market value regardless ol the broader
conditions of the market.
"Like the 'brick-and-mortai stores, more cus
tomers. or eveballs, mean more purchases."
Venkatachalam said.
Excite s $780 million purchase of the greeting
card site Bluemountaiu.com supports Yenkatac ha
lam's study. Al the time ol purchase, Blue-moun
tain.com had no profits or revenues, but its site*
hosted ( .) million visitors in the previous month.
Excite expected to reap profits from Blucmoun
tain.com s ( .) million visitors, who will surf to Excite,
but the increased traffic nia\ not make up for the
price Excite paid, Yenkatac halain said.
Mark Wilkinson, a doc toral student in manage
ment science and engineering, s.iid e\ eballs should
not chive stock prices, because no one c an separate
the c licks of interested consumers from those ol
comparison shoppers, for example.
Venkatachalam said he does not know il Inter
net-c onipam stocks are currently overpriced or
nuclei priced.
"Justification for the priccs w.is not examined in
the siiul\," he said.
In the future, c|iialii\ of service, the satisfaction
and retention of c ustomers, will be the primary de
terminant of real market value, according to

Venkatachalam. I he amount of Web site traffic will
not influence a compam s stock market valuation
as much in the long term.
Yenkatac halam said the high values of Internet
stocks spurred him to begin the stud\.
"1 started wondering if there was a method to
this madness," he said, "Why are tlie\ worth so
much if they clou t have a profit-making basis?"
Venkatachalam predicts a continued surge of
Internet-related businesses, followed b\ an equili
brated coexistence with traditional "brie k-ancl
inortar" stores.
"These will not be replaced In Internet com
merce," Venkatachalam said. "Nothing c an replace
the smell and feel of the merchandise."
Venkatachalam also s.iicl that Internet retail w ill
gain more customers than the mail-order industn,
which represents about I percent of consumer
sales.
"They cannot be compared, he said. "In mail
order, the store-front is always the same. On the
Internet, a customer can ci eate a dynamic and per
sonalized store-front.
"Personal store-fronts can bee reateel for groe er\
shopping, for instance. Venkatachalam said.
"Vegetarians no longer have to shop clow n aisles ol
meats, but can create their em n c anop\ with .ill the
types of vegetarian food the\ like. And meat-lovers
can do likewise."
According to Venkatachalam, the swings in In
ternet compam stock prices reflect uncertainl\ in
the future of the companies.
"T he Internet market is in its infancy, the in
vestment stage, he said. "It's true that the revolu
tion will experience tips and clowns, like the auto
mobile industry did m its infancy ."
First-vear business student James Hole called
the decline in stock prices "the natural maturation
of a new market.
"('.ompanies that were created in the beginning
of the surge have a better chance of surviving be
cause thev have had more time to mature," he
added.
