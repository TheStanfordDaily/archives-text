1 >ear Randy,
I witnessed greatness in the final six minutes of the
game Saturday.

torrential dcmnpour--by California standards, most
guys would have simply given up, and, I'll admit,
that's what 1 expected. Hoy, was 1 wrong.
A lot of people in the stands gave np and lelt —
ihey missed i(. I hen there s the people who never
went to the game and only saw a Marques 1 uiasosopo
highlight on Sportscenter—they missed ii too.
Man, il only I could tell them about it.
lii st, 1 watched you change what should only have
been damage control on a hobbled shotgun snap into
a 60-yard completion to Luke Lowell that set up Stan
lord's first touchdown with 5:23 to pla\.
I hen I held my breath as you helped convert a
seemingly hopeless two-point conversion attempt,
showing vour strength In throw ing a< ross your bod\
to get the ball to I)eßonnie Pitts in the end/one.
And after Kern darter recovered the first onside
ki< k, I thought vour time was up. You were sacked on
second down and leveled by a Husky safety on the
next pla\ after an incomplete pass.
So, facing fourth and 12, I'll admit that I wasn't
even watching the game w hen you scrambled outside
the po< ket and found Deßonniediving in the middle
of the field lor the first down. I he guy next to me told
me it was pretty sweet, and m inv defense, one of the
Dollies had caught tm attention.
Hut I shifted ni\ foc us back to the game in time to

see you sac rifice your body against three llusk\ de
fenders on a four-yard lout hdowu run up the middle
to c ut the lead to 24-21.
And when Kerry recovered the second onside kit k.
1 was convinced you would come out and shine. You
clicln t disappoint.
You improvised with 30 soggy yards up the- mid
dle. splitting the Washington defense. \\ hen von met
the Husky secondary at the six yard line vour bods
language seemed to intimate the words, "give me
vour best shot to m\ knees, man, I tan take it as vou
battled lot more yardage.
And when you ran in uncontested on that naked
bootleg to give the Cardinal the lead, 1 was satisfied. 1
\v;is convitu ed t hat the #12 in thai red jei ses was trulv
a Stanford quarterback — that "Fasani" was worths
of being next to names like I'lunkctt and Elwa\ and
I lusak.
I would be King if I said that the last Washington
drive didn't mean anything, because I know it did—
to all of us who weathered the rain, to the- plavci s on
the team, and ses, even to the people iu inv doi milo

Hut even F.lwa\ s successful final drive in 1952
proved insufficient, and he .mil a trombone player
