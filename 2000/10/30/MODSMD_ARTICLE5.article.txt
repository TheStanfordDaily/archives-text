a "win-win-win situation.' Ihe

enter rallies simultaneously, while

nets on Stargiving.com attract
more visitors to their own Wei)
sites.

In addition, the charities receive
much more money than they ordi
narily would lor typical auction
events.
"Imagine only 200,000 tans
who click live times .1 month, as an
average," Philips said. "Figure that
they have live sponsors; 1 million
clicks whi< li generates $50,000 per
month. I here is the potential to
far, fin exceed what can he raised
in the oil-line or on-line world
through auctions.
In the past live weeks alone, the
Weh site has generated more than
$25,000 for its assot iated ( harities.
Philips emphasized that .ill ol
the donations go directly to the
(harities.
"The corporate sponsors write
( lic< ks directh l<> the < harities,"' he
said. "Our funding comes from
philanthropic-minded companies
who pooled theii rcsoun cs. as well
as immense technical support from
Vanguard Neotnedia."
