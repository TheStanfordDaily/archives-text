Everyone Ironi Albert Einstein and Aristotle
to Jack Handy and Jean Kerr have had some
thing to sav about beautv. Stanford professors
also hold their own ideas.

partment of Music and (comparative I jterature
Prof. Hans Ulrich (iumbrecht both teach the
Introduction to I Itimanities course, " I hings of
Beauty," a new offering this year.
Though they teach a single course in the
concept of beauty, the professors possess great
ly differing views.
"What we call beautiful is always an object of
desire . . . something you just don't have or
want to have forever." (iumbreeht said. Ac

cording to him. people can find this beaut\ .m\
where, even in sports.
"There was tli.it beautiful tone hdow n ,11 tlie
end of the game |against I S('.|." (mmhreeht
s.iid with ;i smile.
Plebiu li believes be.ttitv is .1 balant e bet ween
the objective and sul»jt-< live aspects, that there
is a difference between actual be,iut\ ,ind sub
jective taste. According to Plebm h, people
tend to want others to agree with then idea ol
beauty while matters ol t;iste are not .is sin 1 ing.
"You do not really argue about taste, but
people alwavs argue about beatilv," Plebm h
said. "| l or beauty], you strive for agreement
beyond the subjective."
