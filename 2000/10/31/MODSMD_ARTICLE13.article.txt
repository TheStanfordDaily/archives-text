On October SI, 1986, The Daily pub
lished an article titled, "Stanford tomb alive
with mystery."
"According to records in the University
Archives, the current site of the Mau
soleum, located oft Lomita Drive near the
Stanford Museum, was originally proposed
as a location for the Stanford Family's new
Palo Alto country home.
"However, when Lelandjr. died unex
pectedly in 1884, consideration of the new
home was lost amid plans for the construc
tion of a new university in the boy's honor,
and it was decided to build a family mau
soleum on the site instead.. .
"According to an 1894 issue of The
Daily Palo Alio, a watchman died that year
in the guard house that overlooked the
Mausoleum site.
" 'Sentinel house in which watchman
died moved to campus, successor to new
guard is superstitious,' read The Daily in
the wake of the event...
"More recently, after the 1979 Stanford-
UCLA game, a padlock and two sets of the
Mausoleum's door locks were picked and
the doors to the crypt were found open."
Bottom line: Beware! Spooky things are afoot at
the Mausoleum. Who knows what might have
happened at the Mausoleum party last Friday.
