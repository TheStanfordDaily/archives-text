For secretary of state, AI Gore is
expected to choose Richard Hol
brooke, the current U.N. delegate.
George W. Bush has hinted that Colin
Powell would be his choice. But what
if Powell prefers Health and Human

lies? Then the Bush secretary of state
would probably be Condoleezza Rice,
former provost at Stanford Universi
ty. If Bush thought Rice better suited
to be his national security adviser, he
might pick Sen. Richard Lugar, R-
Ind... .
At Defense, Gore might well sound
out the Republican John McCain; he
would probably decline, looking to
ward to a presidential race in 2004.
