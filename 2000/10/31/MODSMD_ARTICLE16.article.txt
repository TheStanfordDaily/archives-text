considers every bit as important as the Apollo moon

"It's definitely the beginning of a new era in human

the United States, Russia, Canada, japan and 10
member countries of the Kuropean Space Agencv, is

NASA is particularly thrilled. Ihe space agenc v
sent about 100 employees to the Russian space pro
grain's Baikonur Cosmodrome in central Asia to wit
ness the launch.
It is America's first space station since the 1070s
Sk\lab and, unlike that earl\ orbiting outpost, holds
the promise ol people living continuously in space,
beginning with today's launch. It's also the c ulmina

"This mission, and this program, is the keystone
