## The 						Stanford Daily Don't let technophilia lead to insensitivity

Be i ausc ol Stanford's location in ihe heart

Yet. on account ol its side-ellects, which range
from irritating to downright dangerous, many stu

seems most ol'the < <>1111111 uiit\ conld not live without.
Fortunately. however, the same age-old solu
tion to most si k 1.11 problems applies just as well to
this new one. In short, use communication tech
nology with the same etiquette and consideration
loi others tli.it \on would normally have in other
situations.
()vcr the p.ist several years, the number ol" stu
dents with in-100111 Internet connections and/or
1 ellulai phones has exploded. It is rare these (lays to

havior in principle, 111 reality, the excessive
technophilia exhibited in the aforementioned ex
ample situations is frequently disruptive. 111 lacl, it
often crosses the line into selfishness.
Thursday, I lie Daily printed an article about
the noticeably slower in-room and computer clus
ter Internet connections in campus housing ("Kth
ernet speeds slower that usual, ()c t. 25). I he arti
cle identified the rapid growth in student's down
loading enormous information files for personal
use from the Web vi.i programs like Napster as the
chief factor behind the slowdown.
We all know people who spend almost every
waking hour on theii computers downloading
song after song 111 pursuit ol the most extensive
music library known to man. 111 response, most ol
us shrug with indilference, thinking that it's cool il
those people are into music.
But, in all lairness, it's not okay. It's under

standabic t<> use the Web lo download class or re
search materials, bin closing up the lines and
I hereby slowing everyone's connection down to a
snail's pat e lor personal amusement is wrong.
Not to say thai one should never use the Inter
net lor Inn, but, remember, your fellow students
have legitimate business on the Internet, much ol
it time-sensitive. Some have resumes and cover let
ters to send to recruiting companies over Job
trak.com before established deadlines. Others
have on-line discussion forums to engage in. And,
.ii some point, ;ill of us have research to conduct,
information to gather and / or people to contact.
And then there's the cell phone phenomenon.
Ii seems that everyone carries them everywhere;
an entire campus "on call" around the clock.
Although cell phones serve a variety ol practical
purposes for individuals, they can often adversely
ailed others .it the same time. Recent studies have
shown that talking on the phone in the car causes
even more auto accidents than drunk drivers.
It remains self-evident that people talking on

cell phone are simply less aware ol their surround
ings. Compound this fact with the traffic conges
tion in White Plaza, the Clock 1 ower area and the
Quad, and it's not hard to see that cellular phones
lit* at the root of many injuries resulting from bik
ers crashing into each other or taking evasive ac
tion to avoid an oblivious walker.
In addition, having a cellular phone go oil in a
class or section — not to mention someone an
swering and subsequently conversing — is both
distracting and disrespectful to students trying to
pay attention and the lecturing professor. Is it re
ally too much to ask to turn the phone oil at inop
portune occasions?
In general, the Web and cellular phones pro
vide a vast array of individual and societal benefits
by enabling us to access information and each
other at any time, wherever we are. But each ol us
must acknowledge that, while these technologies
are personally useful, they can detract from the ex
perience of those around us. whether as annoying
distractions or originators of bodily harm.
