# Overseas Studies program to expand
## 
### BEN FRIEDLAND 
The Overseas Studies pro
gram plans in improve and ex
pand with an increased empha
sis on worldly experience and an
ever-growing global economy,
according to Karl h Sciences Prof.
Amos Nur, ihe new direcior nl
the program. I his year, Nur
planned In open Stanford cam
puses in Beijing and Jerusalem,
but "[we] have delayed I heir
opening because of political and
safety reasons.
"YVe hope to gel more stu
dents going overseas and in
vnlved with nur program, espe
cially those students of the sci
ences and engineering," Nur
added.
The University currentl\ has
nine campuses in Berlin, Buenos
Aires, Florence, Moscow, Paris,
Santiago, Kyoto, Oxford and
Puebla, and lias been sending
students abroad lor nearly 40
years. New locations under con
sideration are India, the
Caribbean and South Africa.
"Going abroad was the best
experience I've had at Stanford,"
said senior Stephanie Cheng, a
political science and internation
al relations major. Cheng spent
two quarters in Paris taking ( lass
es and working on an indepen
dent-study project th;u com
bined domestic French politics
with the unification of Europe.
"The programs are except ion
ally well-organized and the direc -
tors .ire wonderful. I would have
stayed lor .ill of spring quarter
also if the program was contin
ued," she added.
Nur said he would like to see a
shift in the teaching methods
used in the Overseas Studies

program.
"I want us to develop more
hands-on activities and projects so
th.it students are not simply listen
ing to lectures and taking courses."
he said. "This way students will lie
tome more involved in the cul
tures they c hoose to be a part of, if
only for one or two quarters."
Formed) the head of the (ieo
physics Department, Nur also
wants to increase the number of
students majoring in the sciences
who take a quarter abroad.
"Right now, the science require
ments and scheduling is so rigor
ous th.it it is very difficult for stu
dents to go overseas for just one
quarter," Nur said. "It is also ex
tremely difficult, for example, to
take a high-level physics class in a
foreign language."
Sophomore mechanical engi
neering major Chris Van Dyke
agreed. "I would love to go abroad
next year," he said. "However, I
don't think 1 can meet all of my re
quirements if I lose a quarter."
"We have been looking into
overseas programs that can
meet both students' and Stan
ford's needs as either a replace
ment or a substitute," said Nur.
The University has included
Overseas Studies in the- $1 bil
lion (Campaign for I ndergradu
ate Education that I Diversity
President John Ifennessy an
nounced at his inauguration.
"The wot Id has become more
connected and complicated,"
Nur said. "Stanford students
will become leaders, whether it's
in government, academia or the
arts, and they must have at le;ist
a glimpse of the rest of the
world. Which, by the way, is
most of the world.
" I hirty years ago, going

abroad was simph fun. Today,
while il's slill Inn and enjoyable,
taking classes overseas has be
come <i necessity," Nur said.
Students agreed.
"M\ time in Paris has already
opened a number of doors lor
me thai I would nevet have even
know existed," ('.heng said.
The program now turns its
attention to taking greater ad
vantage of distant e learning and
new technology, collaborating
with Sophomore (College and in
volving more graduate students
in leaching and research.
"I think it's important to in
clude other facets oi the I niver
sitv in our programs," Nur said.

as assistant to then-l niversit)
President (ierhard (lasper, is
taking over the position of (ier
