words ilie\ could think ol on a white
board in the main staircase ol their
house. IU tlu- end ol the night their ( re
ation was inomunental; ii filled the en
tire whiteboard, which measured about
loin-by-two feet, <md ii was definitely
dirt\.
Imagine the group's disinax the next
11101 uing when ii was discovered that the
w hiieboard had been erased. The reason
lot the erasure was ili.it someone had
"been ollended'' b\ .ill the dirt) words in
open \ lew and had decided th.it it was his
right to erase those offensive words.
I disagree. What is so bad about being
ollended? Win is n that, whatever the
case, if someone leels ollended, he im
mediateh has the righi to do whatever is
m lus powei to destroy that ollending
Ioke? In (ertain < rises, people should be
able to ret ogni/e that somethingoffends
thetn and just tr\ to (gulp) deal with it
without < hanging the situation.
()ne of the most offensive things I can
think ol is using .1 racist or otherwise
prejudiced slur to t efer to someone. This
t\pe ol ollensiveness is significant be
< ause it promotes a wa\ of thinking that
seriously hurts both the present and In
line lives of main people.
but not even - situation in which
v someone is ollended involves material or
emotional harm. I refer to the white
board example. It could be the case, as
some people 111 that house argued, that
mam ol the dirty words on the white
board made people uih omlortable or
that the words seemed misogynists .
However, I doubt that the discomfort
01 alienation these words mav have pro

duced had been hurting anyone to such
a degree that he or she absolutely need
ed to erase those words and prevent any
one else from seeing them.
()l course, it is not for me to sav that no
one could be enoimoush offended by the
words because "being offended' involves
an opinion-based, individual perspec
tive. It is impossible for me or anyone else
to invalidate someone's feeling ol being
offended.
However, I think it is reasonable
enough for me lo argue that, rather
than erase the words, the offended per
son should have first disc ussed the issue
with the house's other residents; every
one's reaction to the whiteboard, includ
ing the oflended person's reaction, was
equally important. I he offended person
did not deserve special treatment be
cause it was not c lear th.it the situation
was extreme enough to allow for special
treatment, as it would be in the case of a
racial slur.
But. you will say, in mam parts of the
I niteel States it's not even clear to people
that racial slurs are unacceptable. That's
where communication comes into play.
Simply imposing a system on people
in which racial slurs are shunned without
attempting to explain why will help very
little in enlightening individuals as to
other people's views.
111 any society, a forum lor open dis
< ussion in which different opinions may
be heard is the best, and perhaps the
only route to open-mindedness. Such
disc ussion is what has made it possible
lor many people to agree on the olfen
siveness of rat ial slurs.
A discussion between the person of
fended by the dirty words and those who
put the words on the whiteboard would
have enlightened both parties. Perhaps
the offended person would have been
able to share lus viewpoint sue h that the
oflensiveness he fell of the dirty words
would have become clear to more peo
ple. Instead, the one-sided action ol eras
ing the board did nothing to increase un
derstanding; it created anger and frus
tration and nothing else.
So if you're ever offended by this col
umn or anyone else. I hope you are
moved to actually work through the
problem rather than trying to dismiss it
and pretend nothing happened. Be
cause il all you do is brush it under the
carpet the problem is never going to dis
appear.
