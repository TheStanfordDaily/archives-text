Vote yes on Proposition 35
(California needs a yes vote on Proposi
tion :tr> to complete thousands of overdue
roadway and transportation projects
which are needed to relieve traHic conges
tion, prepare for future earthquakes and
shore up (California's ailing infrastructure.
(Completing those projects will require
that the best available engineers and ar
chitects within public agencies mid pri
vate sector firms work together to speed
up solutions.
The big obstacles to expediting these
projects are recent (Court decisions trig
gered hv a group ol C Calli ans employees
who want to keep the work ///-house.
I liesc rulings have severely restricted
government's ability to contract with the
private sector.
Prop. 35 is ,i straightforward initiative
that will lix the problem. It gives stale and

local government the flexibility to use pri
vate sector engineers and arc hitects where
it makes sense lo do so â€” something most
other states already do.
It's that simple. Public-private partner
ships will help complete thousands of over
due projects sooner, safely and at a taxpay
er savings of up to $2.5 billion every year.
Santa Clara County commuters know
that public-private partnerships were a
great success on the 1984 Measure A pro
gram. The use of private sector engineer
ing firms expedited design and construc
tion to successfully complete Route 85 and
widen Routes 101 and 2H7 on schedule in
]994. If we had relied on Caltrans to do all
the work, Route 85 would not be sched
uled to open until the year 2001!
Join more than 20 taxpayer groups and
hundreds of local governments, like the
County of Santa Clara Board of Supervi
sors and the San Jose City Council,
schools, business and labor organizations,
engineers and earthquake salety experts
and vote yes on 35.

Save the Foothills
Stanford wants the freedom to contin
ue to build heavily on its land and the op
tion to do some of this on its open spaces in
the near future (10 to 25 years), if it sees lit.
Joe Simitian would like to set aside
some of this open spat e for 99 years, and

Stanford screams in outrage. This really is
sad. Just fora minute, think about how
much development has happened in
Santa Clara County in the last 100 years.
Now try to imagine what will happen in
the next 100 years. It's almost impossible
to accurately picture this, but surely things
will be very different.
Now suppose that the Stanford
Foothills between Junipero Serra and
I lighway 280, right in the heart of all those
high tech and venture capital firms, were
to look exactly the same in 100 years as they
do now. Imagine if you could still stroll
along the trails, away from the bustle down
below, with the sight of San Francisco in
the distance, just like you can now. (Well,
like you could two months ago, belore
Stanford severely restricted access). What .i
miraculous, beautiful gift that would be!
Amazing, really. Just think about it.
It makes Stanford's current actions
seem pretty selfish, and it's very disap
pointing to myself and many other alum
ni. Stanford could be the best university in
the world, if it is not already, without in
creasing by one square foot the amount of
land they currently use. Of all the things
they wish to build, by far the most justili
able is new housing. With just a tecnsy bit
of creativity, they could fit quite a lot of
new housing within the core campus.
At a recent Palo Alto City Council meet
ing, I saw Stanford's breakdown of what
Stanford lands can and cannot be
touched, and much of it is ridiculous. I
