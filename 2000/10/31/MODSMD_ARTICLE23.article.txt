# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Sick from studying: a drug-induced fantasy for Meyer library 
### CORINNE ERICKSON GUEST COLUMNIST 
All, tail at Stanford. A lew trees on
Bowdoin Street are ( hanging
colors. The year's first midterms
send droves of students to the
Bing \\ ing. 1 he (all wind tarries .1 chorus
ol hacking toughs, wheezes and sneezes
at t oss the Quad. Sick season lias arrived.
And, of course, the flu strikes the night
before your honor's proposal, research
paper and lab report are due. Naturally,
the I vlenol with codeine vou take to fight
the fever makes you too di/./.v to read ,'i()()
pages of I lysses by tomorrow morning.
And, yet, being the diligent intellectual
that yon are, you pull that all-nighter.
Your I'alm Pilot confirms that sickness is
not 011 your schedule. You do <1 problem
set in a delirious da/c instead of lading into

the dizzy dreams calling you from your
bed.
Our intellectual egos convince us 11lat,
because we're blessed with brains, we have
superior immune systems as well. Logic,
and basic human biolog), proves this to be
absolutelv ridiculous. However, after wit
nessing m\ roommates, friends <tnd mvsell

us gi 1 ill\ of an overwhelming la« k ol com
mon sense.
Lying sit k 011 my bed toda\. I nostalgi
call\ remembered in\ pre-Stanlbrtl sit k
days. I would c amp out on the couch in a
10l of pillows and blankets. With m\
remote control in hand, I reigned over the
rec room's television. Not even m\ sisters
could challenge my I A show selection. I
was sit k. ,iiul that wrapped me in an
afghan of power.
I alwavs lined up friends to write down

ni\ assignments and lend me notes, but,
otherwise, school was the last thing oil mv

m\ brain and only paid attention to in\
bodv, I was never out si( k for more than
two days.
\l\ first fever at Stanford lasted lor two
weeks, but, during that time, I only missed
two tlasses. My drug-induced vertigo
made mv top bunk in Brainier a difficult
plat e to reach and an even more precari
ous place to sleep. Then, there was the in
evitable festivity and noise of the all-fiosh

large enough and empty enough to serve

floors, its few late-night inhabitants

I herefore, I advocate relocating the few
computers and tables inside Meyer to
