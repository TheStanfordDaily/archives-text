This year's Sixth Man (Hub is niosth un

is an ele( ironic ticketing s\sleni that allows
students to swipe their Stanlbrd 11) cards in
order to be admitted to games, eliminating
the need lor papei tickets.
I he real innovation began last vear with
the advent ola point svsteni that gave those
students who attended the most Stanford
home games an advantage in obtaining u< k
ets Ibr the season's prioritv games. l'rioritv
games Ibr the upcoming season include
anticipated dashes with Ari/ona, ( al
ifornia and I ('.IA.

.Students also worried that the svstem
would grant an unfair advantage to stu
dents from the liav Area, who \v< >uld be able
to gain extra points by attending home
games in December when other students
were at home during wintei break.
I heir concerns were unwarranted,

"We don i want empty seats in the stu
