"I was really pleased with the way thai
we played against (lal, this time around,"
said senior goalkeeper Adam Xapala. "I
thought it was one of our better perfor
mances in some ways. We always knew ii
would be tough playing at their place, but I
think we really took control ol the match
from the very beginning."
( loming up big for the (lardinal in Sun
day's game was senior Scott 1 .eber, who put
away two goals, and sophomore Roger
Levesque, who finished oil the scoring with
his sixth goal of the season.
It would not take long for Stanlord to
takeover the game. Right Irotn the start the
(lardinal came out strong, looking to finish
the game off early.
At the 12 minute mark senior delender
Lee Morrison sent a ball down the tight
side ol the field to senior midfielder Matt
Moses. On the cross Moses .connected with
Leber inside the box, who with one quick
move, beat his delender and put the ball in
the back of the net lot what would ulti

be doubly tough because Cal was
on a bit of a winning streak and its
always hard to beat teams vviih mo

With continued success on of
fense, the Cardinal has now put
away 52 goals this season, making
Stanford the third-highest scoring
offense in the nation. ()n the other
side of the ball, the team has been
almost perfect, giving up only four
goals all season.
At this point in the season, the
defense has been instrumental in

complementing the offense and
crucial in keeping the Cardinal in
every game. A combination of the
four backs- seniors Chris Gores
and Morrison, junior Aaron Biddle
and sophomore Todd Dunivant
along with the play of Zapala has
Stanford at the top of both major
defensive statistics: best shutout
percentage and lowest goals against
average.
It is this combination of a high
powered offense and tough de
fense that has the Cardinal ranked
as one of the top teams in the coun
try.
"I think this sets us up fora
great game next weekend against
[No. 1| Indiana," said senior
Luke Rust. "Everybody is looking

forward to this. Not only does it
give us the opportunity to show
the rest of the country that we're
for real, but it also gives us a
chance at a seeded position in the
tournament."
With only three games left in the
season, the NCAA Tournament is a
rapidly approaching concern for
the team. With Sunday's win over
Cal, the Cardinal has likely won a
spot in the tournament as it now sits
tied at No. 1 in the Pat 10 with rival
Washington.
Before it can look to concen
trate their efforts on the postsea
son, Stanford will have to defend
its nearly untainted record as they
face No. I Indiana on Nov. 4 and
No. 14 UCLA on Nov. 10.
