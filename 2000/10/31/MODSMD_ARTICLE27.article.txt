### EZRA CALLAHAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
So maybe the Stanford women's vol
leyball team (13-9,0-7 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) didn't play its strongest match of
the season last night. And maybe the
crowd at Maples Pavilion was one of the
smallest of the year. And maybe the 800
fans in attendance cheered louder for the
costume contest during the intermission
than for anything that happened on the
court.
I he No. 17 Cardinal was still able to
rebound from a slow start to take down
Saint Mary's (9-12) M-0 in a non-confer
ence match.
All 13 members of the Stanford squad
contributed to the victory, which looks far
more lopsided on paper than it did on
the court. The (lardinal hit at a .333 clip

" Tonight everyone got to play, so we
were working with different lineups,''

"Maybe there wasn't always the chem
istry we wanted and we didn't look so
strong at times, but we did pull through.
Stanford struggled to get going in the

"We had a lack of locus and general
enthusiasm early," s.iid senior setter
Lindsay Kagavva. "We got oil'to a rough
start, and we had to create our own
