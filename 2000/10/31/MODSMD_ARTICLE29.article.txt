on cruise control against l'( '.LA.
ranked No. 5, and I SC., ranked
No. 25.
The Cardinal temporarily
veered oil course in its match
against UCLA, the second-place
team in the Pac 10, on Friday
night with a 5-0 loss, lint Stan
ford regrouped in difficult condi
tions on Sunday in order to
record a much needed 1-2 win
against the I rojans.
The journey south meant
more than just a plat e in the con
ference standings. Stanford's
showing in these two difficult
road matches in the Pac 10 will
play an important part next Sun
day when the N("A\ tournament
committee decides which schools
will (|ualil\ lor this year's tourna
ment. Stanford has competed in
the NCAA tournament l< >i four
of the last live years, including
last year when the Cardinal
readied the third round before
losing to finalist Notre Dame.

he a big weekend for us both be
cause of the conference stand

half.
"We weren't able to put any
thing away even though we
plaved fairly well." said senior co
captain Sliauna Ini.
In the second half, the (lardi
nal showing took a turn for the
worse. Less than a minute after
the ( ardinal ku ked oil the ball to
Ixgin the half, I CLA intercept
ed the pass and was again pres
suring the Cardinal defense.
I Ins time, Stephanie Rigamat
sent .i through ball to the speedv
