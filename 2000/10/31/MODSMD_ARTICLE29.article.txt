he a big weekend for us both be
cause of the conference stand

Li Pierre.
At the beginning of Friday
night's game against I CLA.

Stanford looked uncomfortable

high pressure defense <uid had
trouble stringing pa se togeth
er. but, the voting Cardinal de
fense, led by senior goalkeeper
('.arlv Sniolak and junior defend
er Amy Saner, stymied three very
good bruin opportunities. Kven

a hole in the C lardinal defense.
I CIA opened the storing in
the 23rd minute when their lead
ing scorer, I 'racy Milburn. set up
senior Venus |ames with a ( loss
that put the bruins ahead. Alter

attack the bruin defense. Al
though UCLA went into liall
tinie with a I -0 lead, the ( .ardinal
and the bruins recorded the
same number of shots in the first
half.
"We weren't able to put any
thing away even though we
plaved fairly well." said senior co
captain Sliauna Ini.
In the second half, the (lardi
nal showing took a turn for the
worse. Less than a minute after
the ( ardinal ku ked oil the ball to
Ixgin the half, I CLA intercept
ed the pass and was again pres
suring the Cardinal defense.
I Ins time, Stephanie Rigamat
sent .i through ball to the speedv
|allies who needed only to tap
the ball bv Sniolak to record her
second goal of the night. |ust
three minutes later. I CLA put
the game away for good when
freshman forward Lindsay Greco
finished a Milburn cross from just
