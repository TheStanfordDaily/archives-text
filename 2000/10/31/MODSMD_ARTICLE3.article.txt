I lave vou ever laced I ho agony of
wailing lot half an hour to pick up a
package Ironi the posl oflicc? Sonic
relief mayllix i in store.
As ol yesterday, the post ollice
opened nine new parcel lockers in
graduate housing, relieving lines a)
the main station and making il more
convenient lor graduate students to
pick up their mail.
In the past, graduate students re
ceived their mail in their residences
but were forced to stand in lineal the
post ollice to receive their parcel de
liveries. 1 he Postal Service on cam

thcASSI Postal fask Force litis past
spring.
"I Ibund this quite absurd and a
massive inconvenience to a large
group of students," said sophomore
Michael Osofsky, the chairman of
the task force.
The new parcel lockers are the
latest in a long list of changes this
year for the posl oflicc, including a

renovated building with parcel

Ihird-year law student IV C Re

year detailing the post ollice s prob
lems, applauded the new lex kers.
"This is certainly the most re
sponsive post ollice in the three
years 1 have been here," said (Re
venger. " The post ollice has lx*en
very cooperative, and subsequently
there has Ixrcn a vast improvement
in communications."
ThcASSU Postal Task Force was
created last winter to address stu
dents' comments about postal ser
vice. Ihe pic ture of a postal em

year and caused a change in per
