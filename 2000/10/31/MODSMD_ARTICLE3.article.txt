I lave vou ever laced I ho agony of
wailing lot half an hour to pick up a
package Ironi the posl oflicc? Sonic
relief mayllix i in store.
As ol yesterday, the post ollice
opened nine new parcel lockers in
graduate housing, relieving lines a)
the main station and making il more
convenient lor graduate students to
pick up their mail.
In the past, graduate students re
ceived their mail in their residences
but were forced to stand in lineal the
post ollice to receive their parcel de
liveries. 1 he Postal Service on cam
pus brought this to the attention of
thcASSI Postal fask Force litis past
spring.
"I Ibund this quite absurd and a
massive inconvenience to a large
group of students," said sophomore
Michael Osofsky, the chairman of
the task force.
The new parcel lockers are the
latest in a long list of changes this
year for the posl oflicc, including a

renovated building with parcel
1< xkers.
Ihird-year law student IV C Re
venger, who started an e-mail lisi last
year detailing the post ollice s prob
lems, applauded the new lex kers.
"This is certainly the most re
sponsive post ollice in the three
years 1 have been here," said (Re
venger. " The post ollice has lx*en
very cooperative, and subsequently
there has Ixrcn a vast improvement
in communications."
ThcASSU Postal Task Force was
created last winter to address stu
dents' comments about postal ser
vice. Ihe pic ture of a postal em
ployee throwing away undelivered
mail sparked student outrage last
year and caused a change in per
sonnel and a more productive dis
course Ix'iwecn the postal service
and students.
Flie nine lice-standing lockers
have been placed at strategic loca
tions in graduate housing buildings
including lilac kwelder, druthers
11, ill, (Mothers Memorial Hall, Mo
larland and (Mullen. I lie lin.il loin
1( k kei s were plat ed in Rains I louses.
i n I lie coming weeks, new par

oihei graduate student resi
dences. I hey will join the com
plement ol lockers already at
S< hwab, the low rises. Studios I -4,
I loskins and I Inline.

Kaeh panel locker holds at
least two parcels. When a parcel
arrives lor a student, the parcel is
placed in the lot ker and the key is
given to the student through the
mail. (Graduate students can then
pick up packages at their leisure.
According to Rav (.linn, the
Stanford station manager, the re
el ii( lion in traHic at the post ollicc
will help all customers.
"Almost a third ol the people
who come to pick up packages are
graduate students," Chun said.
"With the new lockers, many
graduate students won't tome to

the post ollice, meaning shortei
lines."
(Revenger is a little more cau
tious. "Much of the line at the post
ollice is a result of parcels ili;ii re
quire signatures for delivery. I lie
new parcel lockers won't reduce
this traflic at all. lie said.
" I lie two largest problems at
the post office have been long
lines and lateness ol delivery,"
Osofskv said. "In the future, we
will have mock s.tlcs by volunteci
students to gauge the post oil it e's
level ol service, as well as surveys
