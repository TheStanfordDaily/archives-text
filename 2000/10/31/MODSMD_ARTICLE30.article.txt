of "I lie gardens," a second

the mirror, puckers her lips and runs
bright red lipstick ac ross her mouth.
Across town, Misti Rodriguez, a ju
nior, checks her watch lor the third
time. It is a Friday afternoon and she is
outside of Thrifty Rent A Car waiting
lor senior Elena Conte to finish the
rental paperwork.
When (lonic completes signing the
rental agreements she, Rodriguez and
tutors (iabriel Doininguez, (lisco Barron
and Paloma Rosenbauin, all Stanlord
students, split up, ( limbing into the dri

In addition to two hours of tutoring,

the coordinators

Still, their concerns are philosophical

out how to navigate the delicate rela

ubiquitous connotations of community
service.

would have rich lives without us here. II we
didn't do this, they'd still be smart people and
accomplish some great things. We're just Hy
ing to lu-lp them out and make some things a
little easier given the barriers th.ti they have,"
she added.
This attitude puts a

new twist on commu
nity service and blurs
the dichotomy be
tween tutor and stu
dent. Rather than
give the kids the mes
sage that their lives
need outside help,
"it's not about what
we [at Stanford] are
giving to them. In
stead Barrio Assis
tance is about the re
distribution of skills.
We're there to help
them out as much as
they are there to help
us. That it works out
that way is cool,"
(lonte said.
Ihe program is
family-based, leading
to strong bonds be
tween the Kast Palo
Alto and Stanford stu
dents. Barrio Assis
tance has been work
ing with some families
for more than 10

years, emphasizing literacy, reading, writing
and math.
(lonte said that one of the largest struggles
that the program goes through every year is
obtaining special fees.
"Kvery year we fight and struggle for our
operating budget," she s.«id. "A lot of people
don't even know about it. Thev don't realize
that what we are doing is much more than a

tutoring group. Its a social movement."
Coordinator Cassandra Sweet, a senior,
pointed out that Barrio Assistance is t lie old
est student-run community-service organiza
tion on campus, and while many student
groups get funding from organizations like
Ford, Barrio Assis-

tance remains solely
dependent on I niver
sitv funding.
"It's really because
our si,iff is so commit
ted that ihis works.
Our tutors make a
year-long commit
ment to the kids. A lot
of our coordinators ul
timately end up as
teachers working in
communities like | Kast
Palo Alto]," Sweet said.
"lake Elena, she
probably told you she
worked 20 hours, but
it's really more like 30
to 10. The priority in
her life is BA. When
she wakes up in the
morning and makes a
list, BA comes first.
These kids come first.
It's our dutv to c reate a
culturally empowered
education," she
added.
File young partici-

pants seem to appreciate the attention. I heir
smiles, their lipstick-coated teeth and hair
sprayed hair can't disguise children with
poise and confidence, and costumes can't
camouflage their strength.
For Rodriguez, this is what makes it .ill
worth it.
I really can't think of a better wa\ to he
spending my time."
