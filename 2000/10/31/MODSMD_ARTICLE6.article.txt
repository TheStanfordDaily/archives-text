# Hagelin: physicist for prez
## Natural Law Party candidate worked on superstring theory at SLAC 
### JEFFREY TAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Working on particle physics, deep
within the labyrinths of Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center in 1082 was a bright,
articulate post-doctoral scientist by the
name of John Hagelin. Me was by most
accounts a nice man. lived down the road
in Palo Alto and made friends among bis
fellow post-doctoral lellows at SI A(dur
ing his brief sojourn at the Farm.
"It was a wonderful, fantastic research
environment probably the most prolific
period of my research," he said.
Fast forward 18 years. Hagelin is now
a professor at the Maharishi I niversity
of Management and presidential c andi
date for the Natural Law I'art v. Despite
drawing less than I percent support in
recent national polls, Hagelin continues
tocampaign, trying to spread his ideas to
the Americ an nconle.

Personal background
"When I was very young I was very
captivated by the spate program and
spate exploration. Deep interest in sci
cncc and how things work, how the uni
verse worked, captured me .it a young
age, has never faded," he said.
Alter getting a I'll.I), in physics from
Harvard I niversity, llagelin worked on
particle and theoretical physics, co-writ
ing research papers with other physicists
and helping to develop SI (5). the so
called flipped theory based on super
string theory.
Snperstring theory states that every
thing in the world is made up of tiny par
ticles called supers!rings, which are even
smaller than quarks and other subatom
ic particles, hence unifying all things in
the universe.
Although his research showed great
promise, llagelin began it) increasingly
look towards politics in the late '80s.
"By 1990 I was more involved in ap
plied science and public policy, working
with (longrcss with forward-looking so
lutions to crime prevention, health care,

John Haaelin, candidate for president on the Natural Law
Party ticket, did physics reasearch at SLAC in the early
'80s. Hagelin believes in a flat tax, free trade and the use
of transcendental meditation to resolve conflicts.
environmental poliev. I realized ii
would he much more powerful to

polilK.ll prot ess. he said.
"We pretty much have a strict
duopoly in this countr\, Innded l>\
the same interests that exert a
stranglehold on the political
process. It was a realization over
vearsol working with ('ongress. In
1002 I realized an opportunity to
build an lie independent voice lor
the independent voters and non
voters, including main students."
In 1002, under the banner ol
the newly iormed Natural Law
Party, Hagelin ran for president.
\lter he lost, he ran again in I00(i.
The Natural Law Party
and its platform
I 'ontided in I 002 to "bring the
law ol science into politics," the
Natural Law I 'ait \ believes that
the country's political problems
< an be solved i! a systematic, scien
tific approach is applied towards
finding solutions.

said. "Right now in government,
the candidate that spends the
most wins. I hat's no foundation
for government. We should have
citizen government made up of
successful people who have gen
uine competence and experience
to oiler our country."
I le added that while politicians
give lip service to having efficient

lied to special interests to ellect

When asked about what he'd
do with taxation policy , he slated,
"(au rent tax code has become so
complex . . . that it's an incredibly
wasteful system. A flat tax allows
people to keep more. It's simple,
it's clean. It removes Congress'
endless ability to manipulate the
lax code lor corporate interests.
It's lair, in the sense th.it your
keep <i large proportion of what
you earn. There is an incentive to
work. It's a key law of nature upon
which free enterprise is based."
Hagelin says that Ins proposal

On health care, Hagelin advo
cates using science to improve
people's health. IJy "utilizing the
most profound laws of nature gov
erning the human pliysiology and

I he immune system to prevent dis
ease and promote health," costs
can then be driven down.
On live trade, Ilagelin crit
< i/c( 1 spec ial interests once again.
Hie World I rade Organization,
he said, is ".ill negotiated trade.
I rade should benefit all people,
including labor, human rights, en
vironment. I hey don't have a seat
at the WTO, it's totally run In
multi-national corpot at ions.'
Ilagelin wants free trade, but
also fair trade, and in order to en
sure it he is pushing to renegoti
ate the WTO agreements the
I nited States has signed with
other nations.
Should he become president,
Ilagelin would lirsi tr\ to reform

fo get Congress to work lor
the American people, we must
pull the rug under spec ial inter
ests; we have to get rid ol political

I'd do as president, he said.
Controversies
I here are several contentious
aspects ol Ilagelin's candidacy,
among them his personal hack
ground. On the Natural I'arh
Web site, Ilagelin's biograpln
calls him a "world-renowned sci
entist who has conducted pio

neering research ... Ills articles
. . . include some ol the most
cited references in the physical
sciences."
Various groups, including sci
entists, have accused Ilagelin ol
Hulling up his c redentials, saying
tli.it his research in supersiring
theory wasn't .is profound as he
claimed, because Ins discoveries
were only a small part of man v im
portant discoveries made in su
persiring theory in the last thi)l\
years.
Ilagelin responded, "Yes, [su
persiring physic s| is a huge field. I
have been luck) that my papers
have been among the inost cited in
this field. I was very luc kv to have
been .1 co-developer < >112 super-s\ in
metric Hipped SI 1(5) ... which
happens to be verv sue cesslul."
I le added that while he is not a
man who hungers foi awards, s< 1-
entilic magazines have slated that
if his theories can be verified
somedav. tltev might be wort It \ ol
a Nobel Prize in Ph\sic s.
Another area ol coniiovers\ is
the Natural l.aw Pari\ s adher
ence to transcendental medita
tion. 112 ounded In I linclu monk
Mahatishi Mahesh Yogi in the
1 <>r»()s. followers ol this philoso
ph\ believe that meditation can be
a major healing source for life
problems.

Hagelin and his party believe
that meditation can be a major so
lution to solving main of the na
tion's and the world's problems.
For example, Hagelin said tli.n
meditation can be used success
fully in the Middle Kast, where vi
olence has been on the rise be
tween Israel and Palestinians.
" I hose who are involved in
peace research all agree that the
first stage towards outbreak of vi
olent conflio is rising tensions
among the rival factions," he said.
"Research has shown that il you
(.111 diffuse the tensions \ou can
create a more fertile ground in
which negotiations can su< < eed "
He wants Israeli »tnd Palestin
ian negotiators to meditate before
Irving to solve theit diHerein es.
He said, "One percent of the
militai \ forces could be I rained in
real peacekeeping skills like med
itation and con 11 i( i resolution.
I hey should then teach those
skills to reduce tensions among
the rival lad ions."
I le lias also lied his i eseart h in
supet siring theon and Ins s( ien
lilic ideas logethci with transcen
dental meditation, which has
caused some of his fellow scien
tists, including some of his formei
colleagues, to distance tliein
selves from him.
Hagelin responded, "1 here

have now been a thousand studies
on the reduction of social conflict
through meditation in peer re
view journals.' I le said that scien
tists who scoff at his ideas about
meditation are behaving
irresponsibly.
Despite the questions that have
surrounded his campaign,
Hagelin remains confident, lie
said, "we need to take back our
stolen democracy from special
interests."
lie acknowledged that the
campaign has been very hectic.
He said that "it takes a physical
toll, but von pace yourself; you
collapse the day after the
election."
Hagelin's message to Stanford
students is simple.
"He sure to vote. Students have
tremendous power.- Wield it.
I he) should vote their con
science .... A ihird-pariv vote is
ihe only vote that has ever accom
plished an\ i lung. Right of
women to vole, abolition ol slav
er), child labor laws, balanced
budget. I liese ideas came from
third-patty candidates who did
not win, but b\ polling a few mil
lion votes, sent those parlies to co
opt their ideas. Every third-party
vole is precious, i hat's the only
Washington fears, is losing
ihe vote."
