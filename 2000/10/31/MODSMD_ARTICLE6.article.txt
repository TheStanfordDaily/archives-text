# Hagelin: physicist for prez
## Natural Law Party candidate worked on superstring theory at SLAC 
### JEFFREY TAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Working on particle physics, deep
within the labyrinths of Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center in 1082 was a bright,
articulate post-doctoral scientist by the
name of John Hagelin. Me was by most
accounts a nice man. lived down the road
in Palo Alto and made friends among bis
fellow post-doctoral lellows at SI A(dur
ing his brief sojourn at the Farm.
"It was a wonderful, fantastic research
environment probably the most prolific
period of my research," he said.
Fast forward 18 years. Hagelin is now
a professor at the Maharishi I niversity
of Management and presidential c andi
date for the Natural Law I'art v. Despite
drawing less than I percent support in
recent national polls, Hagelin continues
tocampaign, trying to spread his ideas to
the Americ an nconle.

Personal background
"When I was very young I was very
captivated by the spate program and
spate exploration. Deep interest in sci
cncc and how things work, how the uni
verse worked, captured me .it a young
age, has never faded," he said.
Alter getting a I'll.I), in physics from
Harvard I niversity, llagelin worked on
particle and theoretical physics, co-writ
ing research papers with other physicists
and helping to develop SI (5). the so
called flipped theory based on super
string theory.
Snperstring theory states that every
thing in the world is made up of tiny par
ticles called supers!rings, which are even
smaller than quarks and other subatom
ic particles, hence unifying all things in
the universe.
Although his research showed great
promise, llagelin began it) increasingly
look towards politics in the late '80s.
"By 1990 I was more involved in ap
plied science and public policy, working
with (longrcss with forward-looking so
lutions to crime prevention, health care,

John Haaelin, candidate for president on the Natural Law
Party ticket, did physics reasearch at SLAC in the early
'80s. Hagelin believes in a flat tax, free trade and the use
of transcendental meditation to resolve conflicts.
