Contrary to rumors you may have heard, the transplant waiting list is completely
blind to wealth or celebrity status. Once you're on the list tor a donor organ,
what really counts is the severity of your illness, time spent waiting, blood
type and other important medical information. Call 1 -800-355-SHARE or visit
www.shareyourlife.org for honest information on organ donation. And remember,
if you want to be a donor, you must tell your family or it may not happen.
