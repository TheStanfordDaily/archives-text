We're looking for people with
intellectual capital to invest.
In 1988, a former (Columbia University computer science professor organized the
I). K. Shaw group to explore various aspects of the intersection of technology and
finance. Since then, we've grown into about a dozen closely related entities with
approximately $1 billion in aggregate capital. We've done so by assembling an
extraordinary team of professionals, including a disproportionate number of the
world's leading computer scientists, systems architects, and financial engineers.
Now our technology venture arm, I). H. Shaw Development, LLC., is seeking a small
number of gifted and driven people to help propose, research, and develop new
technology-oriented businesses. Business development associates must be creative
thinkers with well-honed research and analytical skills and an entrepreneurial spirit.
We're looking for pragmatic, articulate people, preferably with a background in
computer science or electrical engineering, who aren't afraid to implement—and
manage—what they invent.
I). E. Shaw & Co. will be holding an information session on Thursday, November 2
at 7 PM in Cypress North at Tresidder Memorial Union.
Technology venture activities of the D. /:. Shaw group are conducted through I >. i. Shaw Development.
The I). /:. Shaw group does not discriminate, in matters of hiring or promotion, on the basis of race, color, religion. gendet
national origin, age, military service eligibility, veteran status, sexual orientation, marital status, or disability.
