1967
On November 1, 1937, The Daily ran an
article about t lie nervous habits of an actor.
" 'Trial By Jury' meant a lot to one mem
ber of the cast.
"A 'spectator' in the production, he scur
ried avidly around before curtain time Sat
urday night and got all the other cast mem
bers to autograph his program.
"Apparently nervous during the play, the
tyro began to squirm. A sweaty hand, a
clenched fist in his pocket. Before he knew
it, the program was in sweaty, mangled
shreds.
"Reports were that the thespian spent
most of the night (after the cast party)
patching together the 60 autographs so he
could paste them into his scrapbook."
Bottom line: Some people iust can't stay out of
the limelight, even when they're sitting in the
audience.
