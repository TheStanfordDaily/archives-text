a
Health Net, the managed-care divi
sion of Woodland Hills-based Founda
tion Health Systems, has opted out of a
highly regarded accreditation pro
gram, prompting some of the state's
largest employers to freeze membership
for their workers in the HMO. ...
"We consider this a serious issue,"
said Bruce Smith, health-care team
leader for Chevron Corp., which is
freezing enrollment in Health Net as is
Safeway Inc., Stanford University
andAPL Ltd. "Our goal is to provide
high quality, cost-effective health care
for our employees, retirees and their
families, and accreditation is one of
the main standards we use to evaluate
health plans."
