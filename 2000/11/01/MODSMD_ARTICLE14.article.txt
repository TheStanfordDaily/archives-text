Anti-pollution teams searched the
water surrounding the "levoli Sun for
potential spills, maritime officials said.
A helicopter had evacuated the I I
members of the c rew on Monday. A res
cue tug had been sent to help the strick
en vessel, but it could not make port be

I he tanker wast arrying mostly
stvrene, used to make plastics, rubber
and resins. ()ther products on hoard in
( hided isopropyl, or rubbing alcohol,
and mcth\ I ethyl ketone, olten used as a
solvent.
Fnvironmental groups warned that the
chemicals, especially stvrene, could cause
serious ecological problems il they leaked
out ol the ship. Stvrene is highly toxic and
causes cancer in laboratory animals.

" 1 here is a potential l< >1 a serious ma
rine pollution incident here," said Paul
Johnson, a Greenpeace Inlet national
