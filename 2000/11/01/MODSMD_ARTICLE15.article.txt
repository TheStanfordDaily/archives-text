I he Israelis have c ritic ized Palestinian
leaders, saving the) cvnicallv use the chil

Referring to the helicopter attacks.
Prime Ministei Kluicl Barak warned, "the
long reach of the Israeli arinv could be
much nic>re painful.
"Speaking to visiting world |ewish
leaders, Barak said he talked to Aralat
brielK a week ago to explain Israe l's posi
tion. "but to m\ dismay, the emergency
situation continues."
More than a month of'fighting has put
the peace process on hold, but there
were plans fora new round of high-level
c ontac is.
Aralat and Israeli elder statesman Shi
mon Peres, who shared the Nobel Peace

Pri/c in I'.MM along with the late Israeli
leader Yit/hak Rabin, planned to meet
late vesterdav or toda\. Israel 1 atlio said.
Barak's top adviser, Damn Yalom,
said, "we must settle this ancient conflict,
not with violence but with peace."
But harsh words 011 both sides were
more the norm. Ahmed ()ureia, a se
nior Palestinian negotiator, said the Is
raeli helicopter attacks "started a new
stage ol aggression against the Palestini
an people."
"The Palestinian intcladeh (uprising)
will continue as long as there is aggres
sion," he said.
Besides the violence, anothci obstat le
to a resumption ol negotiations is the po
litical instability in Israel. Barak heads <1
minority government, and Ins need loi
political allies became even more urgent
Monda\ as parliament ret omened aliei a
three-month ret ess.
Barak worked vesterda\ to build <111 al
liance with the ultra-Orthodox Shas
part), while prospects laded fbi a part
nership with the hawkish Likud taction
led In Ariel Sharon.
Barak had been seeking to bring
Sharon into his coalition, but contacts
broke down Monda\ aftci the prime min
ister refused to grant Likud a veto right
ovei future peace talks.
