## The 						Stanford Daily University Dining is showing improvement

SO MANY CREAT tilings exist for stu
dents at Stan lord — student groups, re
search opportunities, an ac tive social
calendar — that it has always been a
shame that the lood did not match the quality
of the other facets of life. But, in the last year,
Dining Services has made serious strides to
catch up in quality, llexihility and interactions
between students and I University employees.

also DSL access at every table.
That's a long way 112 rom most of the campus
dining halls, which have little more than salt
shakers to entertain you.
Perhaps the most exciting change lor dining
hall patrons is the addition of the Premier (Car
dinal Flex Plan. The plan offers an unprece
dented amount of flexibility by allowing stu
dents to choose how they use their meals.
Instead of being constricted by a limit on the
number of guest meals and meals available in a
week, students can eat as little or as many times
as they like in a week or spend those meals on
guests. Students still get their money's worth, as
long as they use the meals by the end of the
quarter.
Students can also trade in meals fora la
(arte services at Late Night, the Cyber Cafe
and Manzanita. 112 hese services are perfect for
off-campus students and those who eat at ir

regular times.
After years of complaining about the inflexi
bility ol meal plans, students will be happy to
know the plan is the result of student input
from last year's online survey.
It's good to know that someone is finally
listening.
It's also great to see the Stanford KSL Part
ners program being publicized in dining halls.
We encourage this interaction between stu
dents and workers. More programs like
S I TPS, which teams students and workers to
gether to learn language skills, should be de
veloped in order to break down separation be
tween workers and students.
In recent years, Dining Services has made
huge improvements, from the renovation of
the Lakeside Dining Hall to the improved se
lected of vegan and vegetarian options.
Still, these changes cannot be considered the

solution to all student complaints. Dining Ser
vices should regularly seek to communicate
with students about food and facilities. The new
meal plan is one step in the right direction.
While the plan does increase flexibility, many
students still argue that they should receive
money back for uneaten meals. I his possibility
should be explored and discussed.
And while we all rejoice in the opening of
Stern's new facility, we urge a speedy and equal
ly dramatic renovation of other, older dining
halls on campus.
As long as there have been dining halls (re

room), there have been student complaints. We
applaud Dining Services' efforts to liste and
react to student suggestions and we implore
them to continue working with students to cre
ate an environment in which students, admin
istrators and workers are satisfied.
