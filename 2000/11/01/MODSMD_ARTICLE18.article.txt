against each other straight through
I le< lion I)a\ 200 I, I took some time to
recount the < i\ i< s lessons I've learned
in the Era of Peeling Cood, the Clinton
years:
The beauty of bipartisan sleaze
When news of I'affair Lewinsky first
broke, led Koppel was covering the
Pope's visit to Cuba. He promptly flew
back to Washington to report the latest
gossip on the evening news. Except, in
stead of thanking the president, as well as
eat li member of the vast right-wing con
spiracv, for saving them from the six-
I it in i -long treatise (.astro had planned for
( übans that da\, Koppel and his cohorts
turned the incipient impeachment battle
into a Super Bowl of self-importance.
Washington, Americans were scolded
daily, had turned into a snake-pit of bi
partisan venom. Politics had screeched
to a halt; our government was in tumult.
I rue, I thought. So what's the bad
news?
What the talking heads missed — no
doubt betause they'd all booked their
I if kets home from I lavana at the earliest
rumors of Monicagate — was that there
are plates in this world unencumbered
I>\ bipartisan < onflit t. where the govern
ient can gtneialb do what it pleases.

()nlv no one wants to live there.
The president's impeachment and
subsequent acquittal were a text-book
case of the beauty of bipartisan slea/e.
Republicans and Democrats both got
what iliev wanted and more. I lie Re
public,ins made President Clinton the
first elected president in nation's Instorv
to be impeached and, thanks to the
Democ rats, they avoided the specter of
c ampaigning against an incumbent Core
in a still-robust economy.
I lie Democ rats meanwhile saved
their popular leader and. thanks to the
COP's penchant for making the polis
think of Bubba naked, they pic ked up a
lew seats in the House and sent Newt
(iingric h packing, apparently for good.
Not a bad deal on either side, I'd say.
Hurrah for hypocrisy
Stan Evans, a veteran conservative,
once quipped that he didn't start liking
Dick Nixon till after Watergate. I confess
to feeling the same way about President
(ilinton and his travails.
I his president has shown a persis
tence, a resolve, a singularity of purpose
that history will not soon forget. To
quote one Senator, (llinlon alwavs wins.
More importantly, President Clinton
has restored a sense of hypocrisy to a cul
ture that had become painstakingly
earnest.
Along the course of its maturation, the
president's generation famously flouted
the public institutions ol its parents' age.
Marriage ebbed, divorce flowed and
soon everybody felt liberated to discuss
all their problems. No dysfunction was
off-limits — the more personal the bel
ter. The talk-show replaced the confes
sional, and it got much better ratings.
Sincerity tackled one ideal after the
next. How could anyone get married,
the vanguards of the new age demand
ed, when everyone was naturally a play
boy? Marriage was dishonest.
To the Clintons' lasting credit, they es
c hewed the advice of their generation and
stayed married. In doing so, they defend
ed a public commitment to which our so
ciety grants the highest importance.
Hypocrisy is the glue that binds us to
our ideals. It reminds us that there are
promises that are greater than our indi
vidual failings. It recalls the deathless
apologia our president offered the cur
rent Catholic Pontiff,' We all fall short of
(iod's perfection."
