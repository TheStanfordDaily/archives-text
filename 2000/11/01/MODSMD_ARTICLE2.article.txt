### GREG BRAZEAL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
1 lie Simla (llara (lount\ Board of Su
pervisors voted vesterda\ to dela\ until
Nov. 27 their decision on whether to ap
prove Stanford's (ieneral I sc Permit and
long-term (lonununiu Plan.
I he highly anticipated decision wasorig
inallv scheduled for vesterda\ alicrnoon,
hut the supervisors said they needed more
time to consider public comments, review
the plan's details with (lount\ stall and in
vestigate the legal aspects of the plan.
I niversitx President John llennessy
called <>11 students last week to e-mail 11 u
Hoard <>l Supervisors with their opinions,

.ind Supervisor Pete Mel lugli noted that In
still had "several hundred e-mails" that he
would like to peruse. The Board als< > heard
Irom nearly 200 speakers at a public hearing
on Monday night.
"I don't know that I've ever gone
through .i process where there was so much
involvement, and that's good," Supervisoi
Blanca Alvarado said.
I lit* Board ol Supervisors consists ol live
members, each representing a dillerent dis
tricl in thecounlv. Supervisor |oe Simitian
oversees the tilth district, which contains
Stanford's 4,017 acres of unincorporated
Santa Clara County lands, including the
2,200-acre K<x>thills.
Simitian has put forward a controversial

proposal that would require Stanford to
leave roughh lull of the 1< m >i I tills undevel
oped lor a century in exchange lor permis
sion to build the 17 acres ol academic facili
ties proposed b\ the I niversity fin the next
decade.
"I am supportive ol Stanford's applica
tion," Simitian s.iid. "I don't want to let the
fact that there is one last, albeit vcr\ signifi
cant issue on the table detract from the
tremendous success ol the process and
evervbodv who played a role in it.
Alter the hearing, Stanford's 1 )irec tor ol
Government and Community Relations
Lain llorion disagreed with Simiiian's
observation.
"1 think there reallv are a number ol is-

sues, not just one issue because [Simitian|
has issued a version that has over a hundred
(lunges Ironi the version that was passed b\
the count} Planning C iommission," I lorton
said.
Stanford has said it would accept a
compromise plan approved b\ the ('.oiin
t\ \s Planning (iommission that would pre
vent development in the Foothills lor 25
years In creating an academic growth
boundary.
I lorton emphasized that the plan c ur
reniK being (onsidereel is the compromise
version, not Simitian\ proposal. But be
cause ola tradition called "district defer
ence,' under normal conditions the rest of
the l>< >ard would endorse Simitian's recoin

mendations without extensive review. Ai
yesterdays hearing, ihe other supervisors
suggested that <1 higher degree ol delibera
tion was necessary due to the magnitude ol
Stanford's development plan.
/Vlvarado t ailed the approval process lot
Stanford's plan, which included upwards of
â€¢10 public hearings spread over 1 3 months,
"a model approval that could set the stage
for other kinds of land-use planning deci
sions for Santa ( lara (.ounty."
In addition to the final vote scheduled lor
Nov. 27, the supervisors tentative!) sched
uled public meetings lor Nov. 7, 9 and 14.
Simitian recommended that the Hoard pre
sent some "dear direction" l<>i their think
ing on Nov. 1 1.
