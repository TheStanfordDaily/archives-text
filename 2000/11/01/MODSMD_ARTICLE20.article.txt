Menlo Park resident supports
Stanford GUP
Last night the spotlight in Santa (llara
(lounty was rightly on the brazen attempt
In Supervisor Simitian to tie Stanford
University's hands for the next century.
In the heat, another misguided facet of
his alterations to the (lounty Planning
(lotnmission's recommended GUP was
overlooked.
Santa (llara (lounty should not link
housing to academic space unless it is
prepared to prevent .ill local objections to
Stanford's housing plans. ()ver the last
decade, 1 have watched numerous self
righteous nay-savers obstruct and delay
the housing on Sand 11 ill Road with the
county's apparent blessing. I he housing
permitted by the zoning regulations was
cut in half by Stanford's neighbors.
I hope the supervisors will not hold lab
oratory and classroom spate hostage to
the NIMBYs who have already crawled
out of the woodwork to protest every
housing site Stanford and the county have
identified for the proposed GUP.
Sixteen years ago I moved to this area
because I wanted to live near a majoi uni
versity for the intellectual and cultural at
mosphere it engenders. Stanford con
tributes immeasurably to my quality of life
because of the vibrant life of the mind it
cultivates. On the pretext of preserving
"quality of life," some neighbors who have
squandered their own open space want to
thwart the University's attempts to main
tain its academic pre-eminence because
they prefer to use it as a park.

The supervisors should approve the
plan submitted by the Planning Commis
sion and accepted by the University. They
should override all of Simitian's changes.

Drekmeier's column gave false
impression of profit motive
On Thursday's editorial page, Peter
Drekmeier got equal space and promi
nence with the University's President
("Should Santa Clara County approve
Stanford's General Use Permit?" Oct. 26).
He used his opportunity to provide a fas
cinating example of how the power of sug
gestion and the inclusion of irrelevant de
tail can be used to obscure the actual cir
cumstances in arguing one's case.
Starting out with a brief obeisance to
Stanford as "one of the greatest academic
institutions in the world," he then shifts
quickly to the Stanford Management
Company, "the largest developer on the
Peninsula," whose CEO earns "twice as
much as Stanford's president."
The purpose here is to make it seem
that it's the Management Company, not
the University, that's applying to the Santa
(llara Board of Supervisors fora Commu
nity Plan and General Use Permit. This
makes it possible to suggest that somehow
what's at issue here is corporate profit
making: Stanford's development plan
amounts to "the equivalent of three new
Stanford Shopping Centers, in just 10
years." Of course, those familiar with the

University's application (including Peter
Drekmeier) know that what's involved is
housing and academic space, not expan
sion of the Shopping Center or any other
commercial development.
The facts, such as the Management
Company CEO's salary, may all be "true,"
but they are deployed to give readers a
false impression of what's at stake. In dis
cussing questions of vital importance to
the University's well being, playing kinds
of this kind is unworthy.

Stanford is not likely to protect
the Foothills
Anyone who thinks the Stanford ad
ministration will respect the natural in
tegrity of the Foothills should remember
that had former president Donald
Kennedy, the Hoover Institution and the
Hoard of Trustees had their way, the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Library com
plex would today be gracing the land
overlooking Lake Lagunita. If Supervisor
Joe Simitian's proposed 99-year ban on
developing 1,000 acres of the Foothills is
adopted, future generations desperate for
open space might well eract a small, in
conspicious monument to him.
