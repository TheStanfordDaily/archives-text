Menlo Park resident supports
Stanford GUP
Last night the spotlight in Santa (llara
(lounty was rightly on the brazen attempt
In Supervisor Simitian to tie Stanford
University's hands for the next century.
In the heat, another misguided facet of
his alterations to the (lounty Planning
(lotnmission's recommended GUP was
overlooked.
Santa (llara (lounty should not link
housing to academic space unless it is
prepared to prevent .ill local objections to
Stanford's housing plans. ()ver the last
decade, 1 have watched numerous self
righteous nay-savers obstruct and delay
the housing on Sand 11 ill Road with the
county's apparent blessing. I he housing
permitted by the zoning regulations was
cut in half by Stanford's neighbors.
I hope the supervisors will not hold lab
oratory and classroom spate hostage to
the NIMBYs who have already crawled
out of the woodwork to protest every
housing site Stanford and the county have
identified for the proposed GUP.
Sixteen years ago I moved to this area
because I wanted to live near a majoi uni
versity for the intellectual and cultural at
mosphere it engenders. Stanford con
tributes immeasurably to my quality of life
because of the vibrant life of the mind it
cultivates. On the pretext of preserving
"quality of life," some neighbors who have
squandered their own open space want to
thwart the University's attempts to main
tain its academic pre-eminence because
they prefer to use it as a park.

The supervisors should approve the
plan submitted by the Planning Commis
sion and accepted by the University. They
should override all of Simitian's changes.

Drekmeier's column gave false
impression of profit motive
On Thursday's editorial page, Peter
Drekmeier got equal space and promi
nence with the University's President
("Should Santa Clara County approve
Stanford's General Use Permit?" Oct. 26).
He used his opportunity to provide a fas
cinating example of how the power of sug
gestion and the inclusion of irrelevant de
tail can be used to obscure the actual cir
cumstances in arguing one's case.
Starting out with a brief obeisance to
Stanford as "one of the greatest academic
institutions in the world," he then shifts
quickly to the Stanford Management
Company, "the largest developer on the
Peninsula," whose CEO earns "twice as
much as Stanford's president."
The purpose here is to make it seem
that it's the Management Company, not
the University, that's applying to the Santa
(llara Board of Supervisors fora Commu
nity Plan and General Use Permit. This
makes it possible to suggest that somehow
what's at issue here is corporate profit
making: Stanford's development plan
amounts to "the equivalent of three new
Stanford Shopping Centers, in just 10
years." Of course, those familiar with the

University's application (including Peter
Drekmeier) know that what's involved is
housing and academic space, not expan
sion of the Shopping Center or any other
commercial development.
The facts, such as the Management
Company CEO's salary, may all be "true,"
but they are deployed to give readers a
false impression of what's at stake. In dis
cussing questions of vital importance to
the University's well being, playing kinds
of this kind is unworthy.

Stanford is not likely to protect
the Foothills
Anyone who thinks the Stanford ad
ministration will respect the natural in
tegrity of the Foothills should remember
that had former president Donald
Kennedy, the Hoover Institution and the
Hoard of Trustees had their way, the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Library com
plex would today be gracing the land
overlooking Lake Lagunita. If Supervisor
Joe Simitian's proposed 99-year ban on
developing 1,000 acres of the Foothills is
adopted, future generations desperate for
open space might well eract a small, in
conspicious monument to him.

A vote for Nader is a wasted vote.
So is a vote for Gore.
In liei On. 2 112 leilci ("Nader vole acl
inil able, bill deli inienial"), Rachelle Mar
shall slates ili.it a vole loi Nader amounts
lo ,i \olc lor Bush. I can I sav thai I dis
agree with lhal. I do, however, disagree
with almost evei \ lliiug else she has lo say,
the under!ving theme ol which is a trash
ing ol (leorgc W. Bush.
I ii si ol all. regarding Ralph Nader. In
m\ opinion, a vote loi Nader is nol "ad
mirable by am means. On the contrary, il
represents the liisi step toward George
Washington's being removed from the $1
bill in lavoi ol lugetic V. Debs. Ralph
Naclei attempts lo wage rhetorical class
warfare, siirring up anti-business senti
nienl utulei the guise ol looking out lor
ilie woi kc i and the consumer, all lliewhilc
ignoring the beneficial role thai many
businesses have plavcd in ibis country.
Aliei all. businesses do nol become "big
business b\ taking vour money at gun
point. rather, the\ genei allv sue < eed by of
fering vou a product lhal \ou are willing to
I »a \ lot. Ralph Nader, on the other hand,

wants to take your money from yon — a
top lax bracket of 100 percent, and yon
can bet yon go to jail if yon don't pay — to
spend it on your behalf. Not only would
this rob people of the incentive to create
the kind ol lucrative business that, in turn,
creates jobs, but, on a more basic level, ii
strikes me as arrogant thai he should iliink
he knows best how to spend so much ol mv
money for me. I hank you for offering to
take ( at e of me, Ralph, but I alrcad\ have
a paternal figure in my lile telling me what
to do.
Second, Marshall supports ('.ore in pari
because (.ore supports raising the mini
mum wage. It is very nice of Mr. (lore to
want lo help poor people out, but, alter a
couple years ol do/ing through econ lec -
tures, it is m) understanding that raising
the minimum wage invariabh chives up
uneniplcn ment.
I liink about ilic minimum wage lor
what ii is: An adult savs to a business, "I
want to work lor $f> an hour." 1 he busi
ness sa\s, "I want to pav you that an
hour." I he government then steps in and
says, "Sorry, but that's not enough. You
have to pay him $(') an hour." I he business
sa\s, "Well, lie's onh worth $:").():") an hour
in profit, so I guess I won't hire him, even
though he wants to work and I want to em
ploy him." I'lie guv says, "Damnit, I'm still
unemployed."
I here is a reason why organized labor,
niosi of whose members make far more

than minimum wage, is the biggest lobby
ist in Washington on 111 is issue: I hiougli
the minimum wage, thev're excluded
from competition thai is willing lo do die
same job lor less inonev. Ii would indeed
be nic e if everyone could make six-figure
salaries, have big homes in lite suburbs
and drive nice c at s. ()l coin se. it's a bit un
realistic lo think that evei None s skills wai
rant such salaries. But \1 (lot e can ensure
thai, in America, everyone is above aver
age. I his is a pipe dream masked as gov
ernmental benevolent e.
Now lo Cleorge W. Bush. Marshall
claims thai Bush's lax < tits benelii the ver\
rich — read: "evil while business
men"... and perhaps Ralph Nader, who
has been gelling $10 pei ti< kci lor most ol
his sold-out speaking engagements
which would recjiiire "milling social |>i<>-
grams." 112 irst of all, the lop one percent of
income earnei s pa\ ovci '»() pen cm ol lite
total taxes in 11iis count r\. so il laxes are
going lo be cut, at least some ol ilie cut
should go to those who pa\ the most.
Would 111 is require a "gulling <>| s.iid
social programs? I here are main reasons
wli) it would nol. although I 1 i.ii ( 11\ iliink
lhal it would be the worst thing in I he
world i<> get rid of some government pro
grams. I know that govcriinicni-limdecl
and -subsidized initiatives are known loi
their overwhelming elliciencx see \in
trak, U.S. Postal Service, Welfare — bin I
think thai, in the end. iiconic know how lo

spend iheir money on themselves belter
ill,m someone in Washington l).( 1. knows
how lo spend n lot tliem.
Bush's record in I exas is also trashed in
Marshall's letter. Why is il, then, llial so
man) people wanted lo move to I exas
during Bush's tenure as governor? Are
ilic\ .ill fundamentally lacking in good
sense? Why is il, il he ruined the* slate, that
his margin ol'vic lory when running for re
election was so much largei than in his
1994 c ampaign? l exans aren't stupid, I
don't think.
Marshall thinks lhat "We all need c lean
er .iii and water and protection ol'wilder
ness areas and loresis." Wrong. Marshall
wauls cleaner air and water and protection
ol wilderness areas and loresis, and she
wants everyone else to share her values. I
don't need c leaner air. I was in Texas this
summer and I didn't need c leaner air
there, either.
Of course there should be environmen
tal standards hut not unrealistic ones lhat
choke the econonn in the process. I exas
under Bush must have been doing some
thing right 11 so main people showed their
support both in lhe voting booth and with
their I 11 an Is on the highways leading lo
I exas.
All ol this is not to sa\ thai Bush is the
pci Ire i candidate, lot example, I disagree
with him on abortion. By the way, despite
their thoughts on Roe v. Wade, Thomas
and Sc alia are, in my opinion, the best jus

tices since they are strict constructionists,
which I tind desirable. But to trash Bush
In sa\ ing that lie onh cares about the tic h,
th.it a vote lor him is a vole lor Jerry Fal
well and that a vote lor him is a vote lor the
exploitative "big businesses" that would
kill your grandmother to make aii extra
clime is the kind of scare tactic that gets us
nowhere, lo believe that Ralph Nadet
and Al Gore are anything but aspiring
philosopher kings who think that the\
have .ill the answers is, in my opinion,
equally naive.
