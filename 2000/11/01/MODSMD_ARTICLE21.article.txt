November 2 is an extremely im
portant da\ lot ('.hicanos/ Lali
noswho (1 1<>st- to carry on the
tradition. Ii is 1.1 Dia de l.os
Mnerios, oi the Da\ of the Dead. I lie tra
dition dates hack to IXOO wars before
Chrisi. Ii 1111 1 i 11 s the A/tec theory ol'duali-
Iy: I lie idea th.it lile and death co-exist and
ilia) death is not the end. siinph the next
phase <>l lile. Lg\piian and Asian cultures
had similar traditions. I hex set aside a day
ol lionoi m iememhraiK e ol the dead .is
well.
I lie l).i\ ol ilie Dead became a formal
holida\ in the l(>th reniun in Mexico. It is
a blend ol A/tec and ( atholic beliefs. I he

A/let inlliience ol taunting and ( halleng
ing death is combined with the Catholic
religion's stress on the sa< redness of the
cemetery, or el campo santo, the holv field.
I bis day is a spiritual renewal for lis, a
shedding of an old lile ol flaws. Prepara
tion takes place all year long, bin ilie
cleansing, painting and decorating of
loved ones' graves commences a week
prior to the day.
Mowers ol the dead, zimpalsuchcs in
A/let Naliuall, are sprinkled throughout
the gravesite. ()n the actual day.a path of
petals is formed from the gravesite to the
home ol the deceased loved one's family.
1 his is so the spirits will be able to visit and
find their way bv following the strong
st ent ol the petals. I he petals are left intact
lor two davs in order for the spirits to find

their way back, preventing tliein from be
coming wandering souls.
I he richness of LI Dia de Los Muertos
lies in the olrendas, or ollerings, that are
made to oiu passed loved ones and om
ancestors bv means ol altars oi grave
decor. I liese ollerings consist ol the indi
vidual's favorite Ichkls, drinks and me
mentos. including pic lures and spec ial ob
jects with emotional attachments such as
favorite c lothing or toys. I he purpose of
the offerings is to welcome the dead into
our hearts b\ making them leel comfort
able and ai home once again. fhc\ repre
sent the personal connec lion we have with
our loved ones. (Ceremonies might consist
of a C Catholic mass or a simple laniih gath
ering with prayer.
Ii is important lo recognize that this is

not .1 tradition with morbid or macabre
connotations. Rather, it is an honoring oi
those who went belbre us and a remem
brance ol the special contributions tlie\
made toour lives. It is not <i da\ to weep or
mourn; it is a celebration of ollin — the
continuing cycle ol encrg). hai mony, wis
dom. lile .ind death — and a recognition
that we, too, will one da\ pass.
1' \cry \ear, we commit i<> reawakening
our ancestors, deceased loved ones and
heroes in our hearts, li brings back the an
(ient V/.lec philosophy that people don't
die unless the\ are forgotten.
