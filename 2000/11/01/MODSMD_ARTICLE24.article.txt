inales a paihelic group of burnouts in an in
lense game of I Itimate Frisbee. Finally, the
main chanu ler runs oil'with disc, unaware that
he just ruined the game.
Ruining a game ol I Itimate isn't so eas\
when vour opponent is the Stanford women's
team. I hev are a perennial national power
house ;in< 1 perhaps ilie most dominating team
on campus.
From 1 ( .) ( .)7-I'J'.) l .). Stanford's women's I Iti
mate Frishee team threepeated as national
champions, going unbeaten over 1 ()(i games.
Not onlv did the ('.ardinal destrox the opposi
tion over this streK h, but the team also changed
the way the game was played across the country.

Last season, due i<> a tlu- graduation ol sev
eral ke\ plavers, Stanford's unbeaten streak
was ended In I niversil\ ol North Carolina.
1 here were no seniors on last year's team,
whit It eventualh plat ed third in their region .is
Carleton College won the National Champi
onship. Armed with a kev year of experience,
the (lardinal, led In captains Delia Chin, Robin
Knowler and Kt in I'ercival, expects to rebound
with its sights ol regaining tin- title come spring.
"I'm totallv excited about this season, " s,t\s
Knowler. "We're looking to pick tip where we
left oil . . . and winning nationals is ,i ver\ real
istic: goal."
Stanford was actualh one of the first schools
in the country to bite a < oac It lot its women's
I Inmate team, and coach |ennilcr DonncTh
has clone wonders. According to Chin, I )onnel
ley's innovative tactics "basic alh single-handed
lv started a kind ol revolution, pushing the level
ol plav in women's college I It nti.ite higher and
prompting mot e teams to have coaches."
DonncTh also plays competitive Ultimate
with a club team called Fun along with stu
dents Camille Ytt and Knowler. Last year, Fun

won lilt* National ( Hub (Championships and ad
vancl'd to ilit' World (championships in August
in lleilbronn, (lermany, where the team
placed lourih. l'wo weeks ago, the Fury won
tins season's Regional ('championship, hut the
team was slopped this weekend in the semifi

I lie Furv's success reflects well the overall
abilitv and dedication thai the women's Ulti
mate team possesses, 112 illed almost entireh with
people that never plavcd Ihe sport before col
lege, the (Cardinal relies on the athleticism that
team members cultivated while playing sports
like soccer, basketball and volleyball in high
school.
Stanford captains stress the importance of
team c hemistn in excelling at such a spirited,
.md sometimes quirky, sport as Ultimate Fris
bce. Perhaps it is this unique combination of
team spirit and athletic ism that has historically
separated the (Cardinal from the pack.
