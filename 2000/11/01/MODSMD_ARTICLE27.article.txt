## Where everybody knows your name? The debate over Internet anonymity 
### BENJAMIN RADPARVAR 
With all the luss raised oxer privac \
and the Internet, the debate has over
looked a related but distinct issue that is
just as, ii not more, important: the con
cept of Internet anonymity. I lus differs
from traditional privac \ concerns in that
it is not about avoiding spam or other un
solicited marketing. It goes bevond the
notion of Big Brother" knowing our
spending li.il)its, social securit\ numbers
and credit card data. It is about personal
liberties.
Anonymity is a right afforded b\ the
Bill of Rights and the First Amendment's
protection of free speech. Its application
to the Internet has been instrumental to
the growth of this new medium.
I he Internet allows the unpopular,
the hated and the controversial to have
their say, even if this anonvmitx does
nothing more than shield them. It pro
tects all individuals from the wrath of the
majority.
Where our government is forbidden
from suppressing free speech and (push
ing expression, the majoritx has no stu li
restrictions. I he majority, through cor
porations, civic religious organizations
and the media, can exercise the verv kind
ol tvranm ih.it the government cannot.
Internet anonymity allows the public to
challenge this powet without feat <>l
reprisal or repercussions.
Through the use <>l chat looms, mes

sage boards, informational sites and in

share then experiences,
political dissidents can air
their views, and gays and
lesbians can speak out

about their lifestyles â€”
all without shame,
threat of retribution,
fear of rejection or

becoming social
pariahs.
()n the Net, the
majoriiN is powerless
to impose its stan
dards and infringe

upon those ii does
not like. These are
precisely the reasons
why the right to
anonymity on the
Internet must be pro
le* led from federal
legislation and the in

teresis of private corpo
rations.
At present, the body
of federal law that con
trols ac cess to information
(oncerning Internet users
is governed in the Klec
tionic (Communications
Privacy Act. 1 his outdated

statute was originally enacted in 198f> to
update existing federal wiretap laws. It

requires that government investigators
who seek access to data on Internet users
to obtain an administrative subpoena

112 Rom a judge.
Alarmingly, the act explicitly allows any

service provider to disclose a
record or other information
pertaining to a subscriber to any
person other than a govern-

mental entity."
Commercial sites and
providers like Yahoo!,
AOL and MSN can seek

and obtain permission to
identify and disclose
your private e-mail
messages, chat room
discussions or mes
sage-board posts to

anyone.
This provision is a
direct challenge to
the personal privacy
of Internet users,
main of whom are not
aware of the act's provi
sion.

The intent of govern
ment investigators
and private administra
tors seeking such infor
mation can sometimes be

obvious and often justified.
The popularity and ex
panse of the Internet makes
ii an ideal vehicle for engag-

ing in all kinds of criminal ac tivity, from
trallicking in c hild pornography i<> sec u
rities fraud. Yet the lax requirements ol
the ad have led courts to essentially
"hand out" subpoenas to commercial
sites who purport to have legitimate
claims.
The result? David Sobel ol the Elec
tronic Privacy Information ('.enter, a In
ternet watchdog group based in Wash
ington, D.C., argues that if nothing is
clone to protect the anonymity of Inter
net users, "corporate critics can be c hilled
into silence, whistle-blowers c an be intim
idated and gay people can be 'outed.'
This would be a severe blow to what to
what Sobel calls the Internet's "status as a
democratic and vibrant marketplace of
information and ideas."
I ltimately, the courts must weigh the
merits of protecting anonymity against
the consequences of allowing anyone
am where to sa\ or do any thing about any
topic over the Internet.
As new cases arise challenging this fun
damental right to privacy, the courts and
Congress would be wise to heed the
words of the Supreme Court in its l'.) 1 .):")
ruling in Mclnlvre v. Ohio Elections
Commission: "T he right to remain
anonymous ma\ be abused when it
shields fraudulent conduct. But . . . our
society accords greater weight to the
value of free speech than to the dangers
of its misuse."
