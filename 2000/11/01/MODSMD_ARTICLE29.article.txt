### SALAS SARAIYA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last week, on Christmas I)a\ 20. r >2, Stan
ford's Cireen I.ibran invested in magnetic
strips to make sure students did not leave
the library with books that they did not
check out. For years, workers inspected ilic
bag of every student exiting the library.
The new system involved plat ing mag
netic strips behind the card holders on each
of the books in the library. When a con
sumer leaves the libran without checking
out the book first, the magnetic strip acti
vates a sensor that l>ii//rs.
The Stanford administration called in the
fabled party-throwing group. Waiters fora
Complete Kaleidoscope to help celebrate
the momentous occassion.
The Cireen party, which was to last four

years, was cut short after only a few minutes
due to an electrical failure. Heartbroken,
inebriated students, who spent hours plan
ning the party, walked out of (ireen in tears.
Said WACK chairman Malph Bader,
"We planned and planned, built up so much
anticipation, and it was such a failure. Well,
at least we got our five minutes of fame. 1 he
attention will be good for (ireen. With
Meyer undergoing renovations, hopefully
more students will find their way down into
the South Mezzanine."
After months of criticizing other libraries
lot their lavish spending, the proud Bader's
demise was due to insufficient funds and in
sufficient electric al experience.
I)espite the new technology, (ireen is still
haimtingly behind other, more progressive,
libraries. For example, Meyer takes librari
ans out of the checkout loop entirely by

using self-serve scanners.
The system, which enabled students to
c heck out books without the aid ola librari
an, was inirouduced in grocen stores in the
late 1990s In Optimal Robotics Corpora
tion. Ihe original systems allowed super
market consumers to ( heck out their gro
ceries without the aid of a clerk. The c us
tomers scanned their own goods while the
machine tabulated the total cost. Kroger, a
Cincinnati-based grocery chain with a
strong presence in Atlanta, was the first to
make a significant and profitable use of the
system.
Despite popular misconception, Bader's
cost-< utting measures were neither new not
innovative. Meyer had already tome to an
agreement with other libraries to imple
ment many of the same measures. Kxcept
without the power failure.
