As you ve probably experi
enced, tning to find a common
lime tor 10 Stanford students to
meet can be hard. Inevitably, an
endless stream of e-mails and
phone calls will be required to lind
ill.n one lime when everyone is
a\ .lilable.

Zaplei Int ~ a company based
in Redwood Shores, has a solu
tion lor ilns ,ind other problems
involving collaboration and
(< (inmunic at ion.
Zaplet lias created technology
thai combines the power of e-mail,
instant messaging and the Web
into one package delivered direct
l\ i(» vour Inbox.
\n example might best explain
wli,it ,i /aplet is.
( onsider the scheduling case:
()ne ol the 10 students goes to the
Zaplei Web site. 1 here, she choos
es the Scheduling Zaplet from
among the several dillerent op
lions. She lills out a description of
the meeting along with possible
times .iikl locations lior the group
to meet. She then types in the e
i nail addresses of the group mem
bei s .ind sends the Zaplet.
l\ach student receives the
Zaplet \ ia e-mail. I hough it can be
at (essed in an e-mail program, the
Zaplet looks like a Web page. The
novel aspet t ola Zaplet is that it is
dvnaniicalh updated. If one stu
dent reads the Zaplet and accepts
oi rejects to the listed meeting
times, all the other students who
received the Zaplet will be able It)
see the response. I sers can also
send comments that will show up
in ihe same Zaplet that was origi
nall\ st ni.
Alt hough Yahoo! and Kvite both
ollei tools that help people orga
nize parties, these are W'eb-based,

and do not oiler d\ namic updates
via e-mail. I his feature makes
Zaplets litt more convenient than
its (ompetilors.
Zaplets, however, are not limit
ed to scheduling meetings. Xaplet
also makes polls mote convenient.
One e-mail can be sent loam num
ber of people who then respond to
a question, with the response auto
matically tallied into ;i poll. This
service was especialh ellcctive lor
the Republican National <
tion that (hose to use a polling
Zaplet to get the opinions of thou
sands of members on their e-mail
list.

-1 lie s lor Zaplctsarc myriad.
Imagine a stockbroker sending a
client's portlolio in the morning
Inn having aiiiomatic updates
throughout the day. Newspapers
could send out ;i Zaplet with top
stories that ( hanged as news broke.
1 lie countless uses ol Zaplets
and the pervasiveness of e-mail
have made Zaplet a hot topic in Sil
i< on Valley. 1 he company, co
founded l>\ Stanford graduate
lirian Axe (MS. I nginecring Man
agement, '95), began jnst two years
ago in 1998.
Axe was interested in start-up
culture before he started Zaplet,

but coming to Stanford magnified
that desire.
"I had the entrepreneurial hug
before I came to Stanford, but.
after Stanford, it became the entre
preneurial bug on steroids," Axe
said. "1 really got caught np in it."
After Stanford, Axe had a job
offer with Hewlett-Packard, but
decided to work fora new Inter
net startup, GolfYVeb, because he
enjoys sports and wanted to work
fora small company where he felt
he could make a different e.
Axe joined Reactivitv, a tech
nology services company that also
incubates companies, as an eni re

preneur-in-residence in the l.ill
ol 1998 slioilK alter web giant
Sportsline.com acquired owner
ship < >1 (iollWeb.
Axe knew when he joined Re
activ it\ that he would want to
work with a company that utilized
e-mail, because it was the most
popular form of communication
online. "Web message boards
were interesting, but people al
ways went back to e-mail when
continuing correspondence,"
Axe said.
Axe's penchant lor coordinat
ing s<» ial gatherings sparked the
idea lot Xaplet. At ;i houseboat

party, He met ilit' man who was to
be Zaplet co-founder and »Inc I
zaplet, David Roberts. Roberts
was special assistant to the direc
tor of the largest single intelli
gence program in the U.S. bud
get and served as an executive
manager and decorated career
officer in the Central Intelligence
Agency and the U.S. Air Force,
where he was also a captain and
special agent. Roberts also fbund
ed and ran a database soli ware
company.
Both men recognized the po
tential lor a new platform lor dy -
namic e-mail. I hey kept in touch,
and eventually Axe convinced
Roberts to leave both his position
with the CIA and his soltware
startup toco-found Zaplet.
Alter developing the- tech nolo
gy at Reactivity, the two went in
search of funding for Zaplet .then
named Fire Drop. Willi the help
of Reactivity, they attracted tlx*
backing of perhaps the top ven
ture capitalist in the Valley,
Vinod Khosla, and the venture
capital firm Kleiner Perkins
Caul Held Byers.
"We were fortunate to have
the support ol Vinod Khosla. lie
has helped us bring the big play
ers to the team, Axe said.
Today, Axe is the vice presi
dent ol strategic initiatives for
Zaplet. "Although I am not di
rectly responsible for any particu
lar division of Zaplet, I work with
the team through influence," said
Axe. I le focuses on initiatives that
do not lit into current areas .11
Zaplet and influences current
areas with his vision.
Zaplet is a platform that is
geared to revolutionize the way
people in 21st century corpora
tions communicate. 1 he compa
ny's business application is due
out early next year. Users will Ik
able to create their own applica
tions on the Zaplet platform.
