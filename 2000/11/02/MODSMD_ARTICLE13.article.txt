A sweeping study of the Internet
released Wednesday paints a strik
ingly new portrait of Net users — not
as members of an increasingly lonely
and lethargic breed, but as vibrant
socialites who engage with friends
and family, devote more time to civic
activities and even exercise more
than non-Internet users.
The study, published by the UCLA
Center for Communication Policy,
addresses one of the fiercest and
most fundamental debates of the In
ternet Age: To what extent does time
online come at the expense of human
interaction?
