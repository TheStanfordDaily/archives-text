### 
Published Since IK')!

Tl IK SANTA ( LARA County Board of
Supervisors decided on Tuesday to
illovv more time for deliberations on
Stanford's General Use Permit and
CommunitN Plan. The Board showed good
judgment in delaying the derision until Nov. 27
.md st heduling three more public meetings be
fore that date. The coining weeks will allow for
more communitv input and more careful con
sideration of that input. We hope to see these
negotiations lead to a sound conclusion result
ing in the approval of the General Use Permit.
We applaud the 200 speakers who voiced
their opinions at I lie public hearing on Monday
night lor showing their commitment to the fu
ture of the community. Likewise, we applaud
the hundreds of'students and other communitv

members who sent e-mails to the Board of Su
pervisors in support of their views.
Supervisor Blanca Alvarado said that there
has been more community involvement with
this decision than she remembers having seen in
her career. This unprecedented participation is
tremendously positive. The Board was right to
want to honor that involvement with further
consideration and disc ussion.
The Board also took a bold step in not ap
proving Joe Simitian's proposal. ()rdinarily, tlie
representative of a district is accorded deference
with respect to matters in their district. I lowev
er, rather than adopting Simitian's recommen
dations without extensive review, the other lour
Board members chose to devote more analysis
to their decision. The Board correctlv recog

nized that the importance of the decision war
ranted <i break from the tradition of "district
deference.'
Stanford affiliates and community members
alike should take advantage of this delay by at
tending tlif public meetings scheduled for Nov.
7, 9 and 14. I his is an unusual opportunity to
influence the outcome of a major dec ision for
the Couniv. The Board has expressed its com
mitment to considering the views of the com
munity, and the public must respond by contin
uing to voice iis opinions.
During this final period of deliberation, we
urge the Board to remain aware of the immedi
ate .md pressing need for housing in the Stan
ford area. A solution must be found that will
allow Stanford to address the needs of students,

faculty and stafi living in one of flu* most expen
sive areas in the country.
Stanford must also find the balance between
flexibility and firmness in negotiations that will
preserve its priorities without dismissing the
concerns of the community. Maintaining and
strengthening positive relationships with its
neighbors is of vital importance for the contin
ued success and well-being of the I niversity.
The coming weeks oiler an opportunity for
the Board to work closely with the University
and the community to find a solution that ;id
di esses both the immediate needs and the long
range goals of all parties. We look forward to
Nov. 27 as a day that will seethe responsible and
well-considered approval <>l Stanford's (ieneral
Use Permit and Community Plan.
