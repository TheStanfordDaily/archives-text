# SUMMARY JUDGMENT
## Internet can't handle free love 
### 
The Napster lawsuit continues in
San Francisco, but the problems
ol Napster and (inutella extend
bevond possible illegality. Ihe
free-loving, file-sharing online commu
iiit \(i eated In these computer programs
turns out to have more internal problems
than communism.
Napster and (inutella are examples of
peer-10-peei lile sharing programs. I hey
allow vou to share MP3s and other files
with vour peers — other computer users
across the Internet. Some see peer-to-

peer programs like
Napster as ihe future of
music distribution.
However, software de
velopers have yet to
find solutions to three
inherent social prob
lems: resource scarc ii\,
tree riders and die dou
ble-edge ol technology.
I he first problem is

the classic economic dilemma of scarce
resources. While the music might be free,
the bandwidth isn't.
I he more popular a music-swapping
community gels, the more bandwidth iis
Internet irallic gobbles up. bandwidth
blues are the main reason Napster has
been banned .11 several universities (al
ihough not .11 Stanford). While Napster
useis are downloading songs, somebody
is paying for their ac tivities, either in pay
ing .111 internet set v ice provider for heavy
irallic. 01 In waiting forever to download
Web sites.
(inutella has even worse bandwidth
problems, since the speed of the (inutel
la peer-to-peer network is as last as the
slowest peer. All the 5bK modems out
there are slowing file searches to a crawl.
According to the developer, Justin
Frankel, (Inutella was originally de
signed for onh roughly 350 peers. As
thousands floe k to join the (inuiella com
munity. the network drags even worse.
I he scarcit\ of bandwidth has wors
ened the second problem: "free riders"
who leech the benefits of a s\ stem without
giving anything back.
File sharing works best when every
body is both downloading and upload
ing. This generates a "critical mass,"
where w>u can quickly get the file you are
searching for, because somebody out
there has jusi uploaded or downloaded
it. However, frequently people just
download without bothering to make
I heir own files available.
Not only is it simply unfair to get
"free" music without giving, it jeopar

di/.es I lie community .it large. Since there
is little reward in sharing files, and a high
cost in terms <>l bandwidth used to do so,
70 percent of Gnutella users are free rid
ers, according to one study.
I his prevents the critical mass neces
sar\ for an efficient file-sharing system,
but it also spotlights the remaining HO
percent as targets lor lawsuits. If only a
handful of people are distributing files,
the recording industries can hone in on
them quickly.
Some say the anonymous nature of
Napster and Gnutella will protect users
from prosecution (although this ignores
that your computer's IT address can be
easily traced). I fowever, this anonymous
nature is a double-edged sword, allow
ing child porn traffic and terrorist plot
ting to be conducted undetec ted across
the net.
While Napster only handles MPSs,
other peer-to-peer networks have made
it much easier, and less risky, to swap
c hild pornography and other illicit mate
rials. I n addition to anonymously trading
over the Internet, people can set up pri
vate filesharing communities. One inves
tigation of Gnutella found I 10 instances
of kiddie porn across public and private
Gnutella networks. In the neai future,
we'll probably see bomb recipes and hate
speech material traded as well.
Aside from the general evils of child
pornography, such traffic disrupts the
file swapping community in general.
People do not want to be associated with
traffic kers, either out of disgust or war
ranted lear of police intervention. Some
members of the Gnutella community
have acted as vigilantes, setting traps lor
c hild porn seekers. The P2P community
more closely resembles anarchy than a
stable, friendly society.
While these problems are not new —
they are reflected in the Internet at large
— they are problems software develop
ers will have to fix before peer-to-peer file
sharing goes mainstream.
Napster has tried to address band
width issues, but, in general, it is more
concerned about the lawsuit against Ms
existence.lndustry heavyweights like
Intel are getting into the peer-to-peer
game as well and are confronted with the
same problems.
While the social problems are often
the last issues to be considered, they are
just as important as the technologic aland
legal ones.
