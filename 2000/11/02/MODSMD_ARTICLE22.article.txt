Stanford should learn from,
not manipulate, student voice
I would like to thank President I len
nessy I or having the ()llice of Student .Ac
tivities keep me and other student leaders
informed about Stanford's development
plan.
As one of several coordinators ol ilie
Green Party at Stanford, I've been lollow
ing the issue on my own ovei the past lew
weeks. While I do not yet consider mysell
enough of an expert on the debate to en
dorse Stanford's position, I would like to
point out one criticism of I he administra
tion's eflbrts lo reach out to students over
the past week.
While I believe ii is never too late lo en
gage students in the decision-making pi < >-
( ess (especially one as important .is Stan
ford's development over the next 10
years), that does not appear to be Stan
ford's current goal. I headminsiration has
not surveyed the student ((immunity (oi
the leaders of various student groups), noi
lias it organized an open f<>llllll on devel
opment, though both actions are well
within Stanford's power.
The e-mail 1 received from the OSA,
despite its diplomatic wording, made it
seem that they are more interested in hav -
ing me contact the Santa (".lata County Su
pervisors to voice my group's support ol
Stanford than having me "remain in
formed about (his important issue."
If the OSA's true interest was having
me be informed about the issue, why was
there 110 reference to the Graduate Stu

deni (-onncil's website on Housing
(htip://gs('.stan lord.edu/gsc housing, lit nil),
SOSA's (litic isnis of the Stanford plan
(lntp://www.sos-alliance.org) or the Stan
lord Trails Web sile on access to the
Foothills (http://wvvw.stanlordtrails.com)?
I appreciate Stanford's desire to meet
I he needs ol iis community; as one ol
i hose community members, 1 am particu
larly grateful for all that Stanford has
done for me. But, in the interest of a fail
representation of student opinion, I urge
the I niversity to refrain from efforts that
could be possibly construed .is manipulat
ing student voice. Stanford's time is much
belter spent discovering exactly where the
student population stands 011 the issue ol
development.

Open space protection needed
Many ol Stanford's people at the Mon
dav night County Supervisors meeting,
speaking against the long-term "lockup"
proposals lor Stanford lands, said, "We
don't know what will happen in 25 years
or 99 years."
But, really, we do know something
about what will happen. We know that
population, housing, financial and politi
< al pressures will escalate. All ol these pres
sures will favor development at the ex
pense of open space.
Ii is for this reason that a precedent of

strong long-term protection must he set
now. Sadly, even this ma\ be overturned
in some future crisis. Hut strong mitiga
tion in the current plan will send a cleat
message into the future and give guidatn e
to the people of those times. It is best to en
on the side ol caution and protect a major
part ol Stanford's open space for the
longest possible term.

No contradictions in Nader statements
In response to Rob Rakove's letter in
Monday's Dailv ("Indillerence and con
tradictions luel Nader campaign." Oct.
30), I would like to address several seri
ously misleading statements and vindic
tive judgements Rakove makes.
l irst, he recounts his questioning ol
Nader at his speech last week, staling that
Nader's campaign is "using .1 rotating
batch of contradictory arguments to justi
fy itself. Alter listing four oft-given tea
sons to vote Cireen, he describes Nader's
reply to his question as "a dodge."
Quite the contrary, Nader was express
ing. tightly, th.it none of the said reasons
are foundations fora (»recti vote. Rather,
they are all responses to the question »>l
whether voting for Nader will help
George VV. Bush win the election. I lad the
question of the fear vote never arisen,
