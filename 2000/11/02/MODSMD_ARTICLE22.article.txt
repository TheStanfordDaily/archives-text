Stanford should learn from,
not manipulate, student voice
I would like to thank President I len
nessy I or having the ()llice of Student .Ac
tivities keep me and other student leaders
informed about Stanford's development
plan.
As one of several coordinators ol ilie
Green Party at Stanford, I've been lollow
ing the issue on my own ovei the past lew
weeks. While I do not yet consider mysell
enough of an expert on the debate to en
dorse Stanford's position, I would like to
point out one criticism of I he administra
tion's eflbrts lo reach out to students over
the past week.
While I believe ii is never too late lo en
gage students in the decision-making pi < >-
( ess (especially one as important .is Stan
ford's development over the next 10
years), that does not appear to be Stan
ford's current goal. I headminsiration has
not surveyed the student ((immunity (oi
the leaders of various student groups), noi
lias it organized an open f<>llllll on devel
opment, though both actions are well
within Stanford's power.
The e-mail 1 received from the OSA,
despite its diplomatic wording, made it
seem that they are more interested in hav -
ing me contact the Santa (".lata County Su
pervisors to voice my group's support ol
Stanford than having me "remain in
formed about (his important issue."
If the OSA's true interest was having
me be informed about the issue, why was
there 110 reference to the Graduate Stu

I appreciate Stanford's desire to meet
I he needs ol iis community; as one ol
i hose community members, 1 am particu
larly grateful for all that Stanford has
done for me. But, in the interest of a fail
representation of student opinion, I urge
the I niversity to refrain from efforts that
could be possibly construed .is manipulat

Open space protection needed
Many ol Stanford's people at the Mon
dav night County Supervisors meeting,
speaking against the long-term "lockup"
proposals lor Stanford lands, said, "We
don't know what will happen in 25 years
or 99 years."
But, really, we do know something
about what will happen. We know that
population, housing, financial and politi
< al pressures will escalate. All ol these pres
sures will favor development at the ex
pense of open space.
Ii is for this reason that a precedent of

strong long-term protection must he set
now. Sadly, even this ma\ be overturned
in some future crisis. Hut strong mitiga
tion in the current plan will send a cleat
message into the future and give guidatn e
to the people of those times. It is best to en
on the side ol caution and protect a major
part ol Stanford's open space for the
longest possible term.

No contradictions in Nader statements
In response to Rob Rakove's letter in
Monday's Dailv ("Indillerence and con
tradictions luel Nader campaign." Oct.
30), I would like to address several seri
ously misleading statements and vindic
tive judgements Rakove makes.
l irst, he recounts his questioning ol
Nader at his speech last week, staling that
Nader's campaign is "using .1 rotating
batch of contradictory arguments to justi
fy itself. Alter listing four oft-given tea
sons to vote Cireen, he describes Nader's
reply to his question as "a dodge."
Quite the contrary, Nader was express
ing. tightly, th.it none of the said reasons
are foundations fora (»recti vote. Rather,
they are all responses to the question »>l
whether voting for Nader will help
George VV. Bush win the election. I lad the
question of the fear vote never arisen,
none oft hesc topics would even need lobe
discussed, as Nader wishes.
In addition, I i hallenge Rakove to find
documented evidence of Nader saying
any of the following: ih.it voters can sup
port him safel) because his c andidac y will
bring out liberal voters who will help the
I)emocrats regain control of (ongress; or
because (lore is guaranteed victory in
their stale; or because a Hush presidency
will help galvanize progressive activism.
()l the lour statements given In Rakove
.is common pre >-( 1 recti reasoning, none ol
the above three is actually espoused by
Nader himself. All ol ihein are simply po
sitions given by Nader's sii/)j)orters in re
sponse to their worried or undecided
I )emoc t atic friends.
l he only one of these stated rationales
that Nader actual!) talks about is I lie idea
that the Democratic and Republican par
ties are virtually identical, and this is a
much more complicated issue than most
people reali/e.
I am sure Nader knows, as many are
now espousing rather vocally, that Bush
and (lore have dillering stances on sever
al issues. I lowever, his point that they arc
two heads on the same body, with their
support and structural and ideological
backgrounds based on the same founda
tions, namely those of large-scale corpo

rate support and pandering to the public
to gat tier votes, to name two.
It is this foundation that diflers greatly
from Nader's (who, incidentally, accepts 110
money from companies or Political Action
Coalitions, but only from individuals). Be
cause of this, there are myriad topics that
are never discussed by the larger patties,
because they treat these issues similarly.
Furthermore, these issues are of much
greater importance than the spec ifics "de
bated In Core and Bush, because, with
out reforming them, the very system that
allows changes to be made 011 such policies
as education, taxes, abortion and Social
Security will remain unfair, misrepresen
tative and undemocratic.
I am referring here to the ideas of cam
paign finance reform, electoral proc ess re
form, public media control, universal
health care, demilitarization, ending sub
sidies to anti-environmental corporal ions,
raising the minimum wage, ending pover
ty, ending 1 lie drug war, ending sanctions
011 Iraq, ending military aid 10 Colombia
and withdrawing from the \VT(), to begin
with.
Aditionallv. 011 issues much more latnil
iar to the larger parties, Nader takes strik
ingly dillerent positions. ()f the three c an
didates discussed here, Nader is the only
condcmner of commercial logging in Na
tional Forests and the only supporter of
universal health care, higher fuel cllicien
cv standards, legal gay and lesbian mar
riage and drug rehabilitation. Kven where
Core and Bush difler, Nader differs far
more from both of them than they do

from each other.
As a specific example, I would like lo
note thai Rakove makes a point lo put up
Al Gore's environmental record, which,
while I grant it is slightly better than
Bush's, is dismal in its contradictions and
actions taken in secrecv. While lie advo
cates protecting the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge, a position th.it has consis
tently been received well in locus groups,
lie opened up 2,000 miles of Alaskan
coastline, as well as some ol ('.alitorilia's,
lor drilling.
While Bush's "warm and fuzzy rela
tionship with the oil industry" is well-pub
lic'i/ed, Gore's similar relationship is not.
I le sold the Elk 1 Ills Petroleum Reserve, a
portion of land in ihc mountains of Gali
lornia, to ()ct idental Petroleum, a compa
ny m which the (lore family owns nearly a
million dollars of stock, and who donates
$20,000 every year to (lore's campaign
funds. I don't believe 1 am the only one
who sees a conflict of interest here.
While lie campaigned in 1092 on a plat-
Ibrm of reaching a 40 mpg fuel efficiency
standard, the actual standard has/allni to
a pitiful 24.5 mpg. I he list goes on, and I
do not mean to say that Governor Bush's
record is stellar either, but rather to point
out 11uit environmentalists cannot buy
Gore's passionate greenwashing in igno
rance of lus actual actions.
Concerned voters should realize that
these are the reasons to vote lor Ralph
Nader, not merely because a Nader vote
won't hurt Gore. I lie issue at stake is not
how Nader affects the two more well-fund

ed candidates, but tlie value his ideas have
lor the future of American democracy.
A vote for Al (a>re or (ieorge W. Bush
isa legitimization of their positions and the
structure that set them up to be in those
positions; it is not merely a vote against the
other candidate. For undecided liberals
considering supporting Gore, this means
you are legitimizing the continued motion
of the Democratic Party further lo the
right, lor it they know that you believe you
have no option more liberal than them,
they will continue to drill further to star
board in order to garner more votes.
Now is the time to prove that there are
voters more progressive than the
Democrats. A democracy can only func
tion effectively and (airly it citizens are un
afraid to vote for the candidate they most
favor. If that candidate, for you, is Ralph
Nader, cast your vote accordingly, or
democracy in America will continue to
erode.

No contradictions in Nader statements
In response to Rob Rakove's letter in
Monday's Dailv ("Indillerence and con
tradictions luel Nader campaign." Oct.
30), I would like to address several seri
ously misleading statements and vindic
tive judgements Rakove makes.
l irst, he recounts his questioning ol
Nader at his speech last week, staling that
Nader's campaign is "using .1 rotating
batch of contradictory arguments to justi
fy itself. Alter listing four oft-given tea
sons to vote Cireen, he describes Nader's
reply to his question as "a dodge."
Quite the contrary, Nader was express
ing. tightly, th.it none of the said reasons
are foundations fora (»recti vote. Rather,
they are all responses to the question »>l
whether voting for Nader will help
George VV. Bush win the election. I lad the
question of the fear vote never arisen,
none oft hesc topics would even need lobe
discussed, as Nader wishes.
In addition, I i hallenge Rakove to find
documented evidence of Nader saying
any of the following: ih.it voters can sup
port him safel) because his c andidac y will
bring out liberal voters who will help the
I)emocrats regain control of (ongress; or
because (lore is guaranteed victory in
their stale; or because a Hush presidency
will help galvanize progressive activism.
()l the lour statements given In Rakove
.is common pre >-( 1 recti reasoning, none ol
the above three is actually espoused by
Nader himself. All ol ihein are simply po
sitions given by Nader's sii/)j)orters in re
sponse to their worried or undecided
I )emoc t atic friends.
l he only one of these stated rationales
that Nader actual!) talks about is I lie idea
that the Democratic and Republican par
ties are virtually identical, and this is a
much more complicated issue than most
people reali/e.
I am sure Nader knows, as many are
now espousing rather vocally, that Bush
and (lore have dillering stances on sever
al issues. I lowever, his point that they arc
two heads on the same body, with their
support and structural and ideological
backgrounds based on the same founda
tions, namely those of large-scale corpo

rate support and pandering to the public
to gat tier votes, to name two.
It is this foundation that diflers greatly
from Nader's (who, incidentally, accepts 110
money from companies or Political Action
Coalitions, but only from individuals). Be
cause of this, there are myriad topics that
are never discussed by the larger patties,
because they treat these issues similarly.
Furthermore, these issues are of much
greater importance than the spec ifics "de
bated In Core and Bush, because, with
out reforming them, the very system that
allows changes to be made 011 such policies
as education, taxes, abortion and Social
Security will remain unfair, misrepresen
tative and undemocratic.
I am referring here to the ideas of cam
paign finance reform, electoral proc ess re
form, public media control, universal
health care, demilitarization, ending sub
sidies to anti-environmental corporal ions,
raising the minimum wage, ending pover
ty, ending 1 lie drug war, ending sanctions
011 Iraq, ending military aid 10 Colombia
and withdrawing from the \VT(), to begin
with.
Aditionallv. 011 issues much more latnil
iar to the larger parties, Nader takes strik
ingly dillerent positions. ()f the three c an
didates discussed here, Nader is the only
condcmner of commercial logging in Na
tional Forests and the only supporter of
universal health care, higher fuel cllicien
cv standards, legal gay and lesbian mar
riage and drug rehabilitation. Kven where
Core and Bush difler, Nader differs far
more from both of them than they do

from each other.
As a specific example, I would like lo
note thai Rakove makes a point lo put up
Al Gore's environmental record, which,
while I grant it is slightly better than
Bush's, is dismal in its contradictions and
actions taken in secrecv. While lie advo
cates protecting the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge, a position th.it has consis
tently been received well in locus groups,
lie opened up 2,000 miles of Alaskan
coastline, as well as some ol ('.alitorilia's,
lor drilling.
While Bush's "warm and fuzzy rela
tionship with the oil industry" is well-pub
lic'i/ed, Gore's similar relationship is not.
I le sold the Elk 1 Ills Petroleum Reserve, a
portion of land in ihc mountains of Gali
lornia, to ()ct idental Petroleum, a compa
ny m which the (lore family owns nearly a
million dollars of stock, and who donates
$20,000 every year to (lore's campaign
funds. I don't believe 1 am the only one
who sees a conflict of interest here.
While lie campaigned in 1092 on a plat-
Ibrm of reaching a 40 mpg fuel efficiency
standard, the actual standard has/allni to
a pitiful 24.5 mpg. I he list goes on, and I
do not mean to say that Governor Bush's
record is stellar either, but rather to point
out 11uit environmentalists cannot buy
Gore's passionate greenwashing in igno
rance of lus actual actions.
Concerned voters should realize that
these are the reasons to vote lor Ralph
Nader, not merely because a Nader vote
won't hurt Gore. I lie issue at stake is not
how Nader affects the two more well-fund

ed candidates, but tlie value his ideas have
lor the future of American democracy.
A vote for Al (a>re or (ieorge W. Bush
isa legitimization of their positions and the
structure that set them up to be in those
positions; it is not merely a vote against the
other candidate. For undecided liberals
considering supporting Gore, this means
you are legitimizing the continued motion
of the Democratic Party further lo the

Bush's, is dismal in its contradictions and
actions taken in secrecv. While lie advo
cates protecting the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge, a position th.it has consis
tently been received well in locus groups,
lie opened up 2,000 miles of Alaskan
coastline, as well as some ol ('.alitorilia's,
lor drilling.
While Bush's "warm and fuzzy rela
tionship with the oil industry" is well-pub
lic'i/ed, Gore's similar relationship is not.
I le sold the Elk 1 Ills Petroleum Reserve, a
portion of land in ihc mountains of Gali
lornia, to ()ct idental Petroleum, a compa
ny m which the (lore family owns nearly a
million dollars of stock, and who donates
$20,000 every year to (lore's campaign
funds. I don't believe 1 am the only one
who sees a conflict of interest here.
While lie campaigned in 1092 on a plat-
Ibrm of reaching a 40 mpg fuel efficiency
standard, the actual standard has/allni to
a pitiful 24.5 mpg. I he list goes on, and I
do not mean to say that Governor Bush's
record is stellar either, but rather to point
out 11uit environmentalists cannot buy
Gore's passionate greenwashing in igno
rance of lus actual actions.
Concerned voters should realize that
these are the reasons to vote lor Ralph
Nader, not merely because a Nader vote
won't hurt Gore. I lie issue at stake is not
how Nader affects the two more well-fund

ed candidates, but tlie value his ideas have
lor the future of American democracy.
A vote for Al (a>re or (ieorge W. Bush
isa legitimization of their positions and the
structure that set them up to be in those
positions; it is not merely a vote against the
other candidate. For undecided liberals
considering supporting Gore, this means
you are legitimizing the continued motion
of the Democratic Party further lo the
right, lor it they know that you believe you
have no option more liberal than them,
they will continue to drill further to star
board in order to garner more votes.
Now is the time to prove that there are
voters more progressive than the
Democrats. A democracy can only func
tion effectively and (airly it citizens are un
afraid to vote for the candidate they most
favor. If that candidate, for you, is Ralph
Nader, cast your vote accordingly, or
democracy in America will continue to
erode.
