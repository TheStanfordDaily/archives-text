# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Stanford parties unique, interesting and life-changing 
### MATT BENTLEY STAFF GUEST COLUMNIST 
This weekend offered a telling
arra\ <>l campus social options:
An ambitions reveler could begin
die night rockin' at Stern Dining
11.ill. then go dancing on tlu- graves ol the
University's founders and end up the night
covered in day-glo paint <11 the Svnergv
party.
Stanford certainly li.is ,» unique social
scene: We're a University ili.it lbregoes
dating for maximum ettic iency in get tin' ii
on at Full Moon on the Quad, that fears re
jection so much we gel our roommates to
"screw" us, that denies its own sexual re
pression by baring it all at Exotic Erotic. It's
a place where legions ol former quiet nerds
now pretend to be the stoners, alterno
pt inks, beer-n line led meat-heads or skank\
homecoming queens liiev never could be
in high school.
Yet. when fueled bv enough alcohol (we
honor you, ()' Eenicni Alcohol Policy), all
1110 contradictions, awkwardness and role

playing somehow equate to a damn good
time. iTo the outside observer, it's a very
confusing pic lure. What do you say when a
friend asks, "So, what's the social life like at
Stanford?" lo answer I his question, we'll
follow I lie typical Stanford student in his
exploration ol life beyond c lasses.
()rientation Weekend:
In the beginning, you discover alcohol.
It's <m important discovery. So important,
in fact, that you insist on providing your
friends wilh a running analysis of its ellects
on you ("Dude, I'm so f#(W ing drunk right
now!"). Verdict: A rocky bin necessary lirst
step if you seek to continue the quest by at
tending.
The first fiat party:
Surely, this is die CCollege Experience at
its finest! I nlbrtunately, this year the ()f
-fice of Student Aflairs is cracking down, so,
before you gel your piss-water beet , you
have to get a wristband. Fortunately, fra
ternity members have been carefully
trained to give out wristbands onlv to peo
ple wilh something called "valid ID,"
which means that vent re their friend, or a

female meeting one or more stringent re
quirements: attractive, naive, breathing.
Verdict: 1 lie party is fun and hardly awk
ward at all. Stanford Rocks! Leaving, you
notice your group has lost Suzie from Ken
tucky and Alice from ()hio.
Full Moon on the (,2 11i, d:
It seems a bit weird at first, but that's just
because you've only imbibed enough alco
hol to kill a small mammal. Deciding that
good things come to those who wait, you
queue up to make out with the free. "1 lug
a tree," your parents always told you and,
amidst an ecstatic flurry of puffy branches,
yon make good.
1 lot off that success, you head oil to kiss
a lew more Band c hicks. ()nly later do you
learn that none of them were actually le
male. Verdict: An experience unique to
Stanford and a lew rock concerts of the
19f>0s. Really, the only sketchy thing is that
it's sponsored b\ the Stanford Alumni As
s<>( iation.
Exotic Lrotic:
Removing clothing be lore the party
seems like an interesting concept. But,

once ihere, you're forced to wait outside
while a drunken Irat boy struggles with the
party's logistical complications ("' 1 oo nmch
sausage!" he says). Verdict: What was once
oneol Rolling Stone's " I op (College Parties
in .Americ a" just isn't the same since Res Fd
gave Alpha Sigaway to the I n Delts.
(lale Night:
It's the intellectual haven you always
imagined you'd find in college: The sweet
sounds of philosophical mutterings and
jazz quickly relax you. Lapsing comfbrt
ably into your high school Frenc I), you give
a stunning critique of the vintage 2000
Merlot you're sipping.
By the end of the night, you're inspired
enough to join the French House Resis
tance in their struggle against the- tvranny
of neighboring llaus Mitt. Verdict: Your
romantic interest is impressed In your im
peccable class and sophistication. 1 oo bad
she isn't as impressed once the six glasses of
wine wear off.
FBI I lappy 1 four:
Adios, existential angst: Hello, Brave
New World of mind expansion! You're

pretty sure that now you're s.i\ ing some re
ally deep tilings. Alter all, n doesn't gel am
farther out than KBF—like, physically
and methaphorically —get it, dude?
Someone produces a bong made from a
plastic buddha. You spend the rest of the
night in a lotus position Irving to convince
your friends that vou've reached Nirvana.
Verdict: Vou've played every ( haracter in
Stanford's cast.
Now 11 Kit vou've reached the end ol
vour quest, does iliis mean ili.it vou've fi
nally found "It" — that elusive social activ
ity that realK defines Stanford?
No — it means that you're a graduating
senior. And, alter lour years, you must re
alize, as I do, that this crazy Stanford lilt
lias ( hanged you irreperahly. You've been
through some prett\ bi/arre experiences
iind emerged a true Stanford student: ever
complex, occasionally hypocritic, but,
above all, interesting, You're your own
party now. So get out of here.
