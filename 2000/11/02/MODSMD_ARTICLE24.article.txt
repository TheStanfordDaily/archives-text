I didn't watch the H)N() World
Series. That doesn't sound
like much of an admission on
the face of it, but 1986 was
the last time the Red Sox, a team I

now follow
more closely
than my own
family, compet
ed for the world
championship,
l or many kids
of ni) genera
tion, growing
up near
Boston, that se-

ries is embedded in their memo
ries, like their first rejection In a
girl or lii st berating by a teacher.
I didn't watch it. I didn't watch
the 1995 World Series, when the
Braves beat the Indians in Game 6
on David Justice's solo homer. I
didn't watch in 1993, when
Toronto's Joe Garter made the
blue |ays the first back-to-back
winners since the 19705. I never
watched the (leltics win a champi
onship, never set loot in boston
Garden, never saw a boston Gol
lege football game.
belbre about my junior year in
high school, the concept of follow
ing organized sports wasn't some
thing that I really took seriously. I
spent most of my grade school
years going to Little League when
I had to, reading books, playing
Dungeons & Dragons, marveling
at the first Nintendo Fntertain
nient System. As lar back as mid
dle school, 1 can remember kids 1
knew talking about Final Fours or
Super bowls or World Series, and
I barely knew the names of the
teams, much less their lineups.
Yet now, I could and would
cheerfully spend the night dis
cussing the liner points of the ()k
-lahoma Sooners' passing attack or
the relative merits of ;i Brazilian
soccer player s endorsement deal
or even the plays ol the 1986
World Series that I didn't watch. 1
have spent (he last few years study

ing the ins and outs of teams lar
and wide.
I low did this happen?
I don't intend to pass judgment
on whether I was a better person
or member of society then than I
am now, or vice versa. Certainly 1
wasted as much time then as now,
if not more. But where once 1 sat
lor hours studying cartoon physics
or "player character" attributes,
now I pore over box scores and
special teams statistics.
I lie* pervasiveness of the cul
ture of sports is <i staggering phe
nomenon. Ihe President of the

Bangladeshi prime minister
Sheikh I lasina called the day her
country achieved official interna
tional recognition in (ticket
matches "the happiest hour of our
nation." Kuropean nations sched
ule business and politics after soc
cer matches are set. How does it
come about? Why soccer and not
chess? Why baseball and not paint
ing?
fhese are difficult questions to
answer, but 1 can answer for my
self better than I can lor humanity.
I low did I become a Red Sox lan?
What led me to the spoils depart
ment at this line publication?
My freshman year, I arrived
here from Boston having been in
(California a handful of times in my
life, never for more than a few
days. I played the "isn't-your-state
funny" game innumerable times
in the first few weeks â€” we had
snow, we had chowder, we had the
Big I )ig. We had the Red s< >\.
Proclaiming myself an ardent
Sox fan served both to carve a clis
tinctive niche for myself in the
dizzying sea of freshmen and to
grasp hold of a tangible connec
tion to my home and my roots.
When the Sox suffered through a
40-degree September game, I
could read about it and feel like I

was with them in Boston, despite
the 75-tlegree Stanford sun. When
they blew a three-run lead in the
eighth, I could t all my parents and
know they felt the same pain.
Many come lo sports in the
same way; many come to it as reas
surance, as a common cultural
phenomenon. You join the (>th
Man Club as a freshman because
everyone does. Stores and siaiis
lit s aren't charged topics.
In a new community, it may
lake time to recognize whether the
unspoken community norms per
mit discussions of politics or art or
I Jungeons & 1 )i agons. hni one can
be almost sure in most gatherings

that the latest football game, 11 it'
World Series, and the Final Four
are all acceptable.
I can talk about my mother with
my friends, but I can talk about
baseball with anyone.
Occasionally, Sports Illus
trated or ESPN will run a series
t)ii race in sports, or politics
among sports figures. Win
aren't these the common topics
ol conversation?
Sport isn't intended to serve
as a lens on the world. Although
the intersection of sports and
other facets of culture are last i
nating, those intersections are
dismissed as topics for scholarly
dispute, matters i hat take etlut a
tion and delicacy to discuss and
resolve.
