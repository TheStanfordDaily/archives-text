# Heitmann sets the right tone
## 
### MATT LONG STAFF WRITER 
Stanlbrd teammates reacted
differently to Saturday s last
minute loss to Washington. Some
buried their laces and shed tears
of despair. Some remained silent
and kept their emotion inside.
Some shouted angrily and
stomped off the field in
frustration.
()ne wrote a song.
After hitting 111isk\ defenders
during three Cardinal fburth
quarter touchdown drives, junior
right guard Eric Heitmann went
home and struck something else
— ivory keys.
I the junior offensive lineman
lias played two things lor the ma
jority of his life: football and
piano.
Heitmann started piano
lessons at age five, and at ten he
began to compose his own pieces.
Mm in his small Texas town of
Katy, athletic youngsters were ex
pected to lo< us on ac tivities other
than their musical endeavors.
He began youth football in
Katy in sixth grade.
"When 1 was young I played in
recitals all the time. I started
doing football and in my town
football was everything," Heit
mann explains with ;i proud grin.
When 15,000 people llock to
every sold-out high school game,
saying that people in Katy sup
port lootball is like saying that
Beethoven wrote songs.
You might say that Heitmann
was the Beethoven of Katy foot
ball.
In his senior year he orches
trated a state championship in the
largest division in fexas, the
school's first since the 19505.
Fifty-thousand came to that
game, 10,000 more than Stan

lord's average home attendance
this season.
I leitmann garnered first-team
All-American honors in high
school and came to Stanford
amid as much hype as any line
man in school history. I fe was one
of live freshman to letter in 1998
and lasi season he started every
game at right tackle while earn
ing Honorable Mention All Pac
-10. But the 6-lbot-4, 295-pound
composer still writes music.
"football is such an emotional
spoi l, wins .ind losses, peaks and
valleys, so whenever I write a
song there's a lot of emotion that
goes into the pieces I create,'' says
I leitmann. "1 think a lot of limes
the emotions from football can
transcend i<> the piano pieces ili.il
I play. "
Heitmann's emotional passion
lor the game rings evident when
he levels the lop linebackers in the
league, begging the question ol
the sec ret toStanfbrd's recent run
ning success. Cardinal running
backs have begun lo compile im
pressive numbers, but those may
not be so much a produc I of their
improvement as a testimom to the
development of the offensive line.
"Lineman are the core of the
lootball team," says head coach
Tyrone Willingham. "Without
their success, there's no success
anywhere. | Heitmann's] skill
level on and oil the field allows
him to possess the maturity to
lend a hand toothers. I lis dedica
tion to be a great player rubs oil
on others around him."
Hut alter a third-and-short
play where the linemen surge
into the opposing defense, open
ing up a hole big enough lor a
first down, the loudspeaker
booms wilh the name of the ball
carrier. What the announcer fails
lo note is that llieollenseowes the

continuation of that drive to the
linemen's intensity.
Km I leitinann and his (omp.i
triots must be content, lor a line
man's success is the success ol his
team, not personal statistics.
Blocking is about being unselfish.
"That's something that being
an offensive lineman you come to
accept," I leitinann says. "When I
liear the running back's name for
getting that extra yard, I know
myself that we were the ones
helping him on that play. That's
enough for us."
The only personal recognition

Heitmann craves comes at the
finish ol each season, when the
NCAA honors its All-Americans.
I fe is determined to make that
list, and to secure a future for
himself in professional football.
"1 think a lot about my possi
bility of playing in the next
league," Ileitinann says."I think
that what I've got to do is just stay
healthy and keep improving each
week. Hopefully I'll get the op
portunity to be successful at the
next level."
And m the N IT, the songs will
only become sweeter.
