### JIMMY WU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the fourth straight year, the Stanford
University men's tennis team completed its
fall season by sweeping the singles and dou
bles titles at the ITA Regional Champi
onships at (California over the past live days.
I lie tournament ended Wednesday with
top seed junior K.J. Hippensteel, ranked
filth nationally, ousting Kith-seed Adrian
Barnes of California in relatively easy fash
ion — (i-4. 6-1 — for the singles title. The
No. 3 doubles team, consisting of sopho
mores David Martin and Scott Lipsky, com
pleted the sweep with an 8-4 pro-set win
over the top-seeded pair of Barnes and Scott
Kintz of California.
With his victory, Hippensteel captured
his third career singles title and his second at
the ITA Regional Championships. More
importantly, Hippensteel and Martin/ Lip
sky guarantee themselves a spot in the I IA
National Indoor Championship to be
played in Dallas Feb. 1 io4.
I he title match was lightly contested
from the outset as both Hippensteel and
Barnes broke each other's serves at 3-2 and
3-3, respectively. However, Hippensteel
took over the match and won the next seven
games to take control.
"K.J. had an incredible tournament by
winning it," assistant coach John Y\ hitlinger

said. "I le played solidly all throughout."
I lie relatively untested team of Martin
and Lipsky impressed the coat lies by upset
ting Barnes and kini/, 8-4, easily. The dou
bles victory was I lie second of Martin's ca
reer and the first for l.ipskv.
"We had many bright spots ai the tour
nament including the doubles win,"
Whitlinger said. Martin and Lipsky "have
not played much together, so ii was nic e to
see them come out victorious."
I lie team sent a total of nine players, in
cluding loutdoubles teams, to represent the
Cardinal ai the Regional Championships,
which had a 128-player draw. I "lie only per
son missing was the No. I-ranked and de
lending I I A singles champion, senior Alex
Kim.
However. Hippensteel and 74th-ratiked
Martin, who teamed last year to win the ITA
doubles championship, both helped lead
Ihe team to a successful finish of the fall sea
son. Hippensteel was the only player to con
centrate on single s play.
Stanford was able to send seven return
ing starters and two freshmen newcomers,
who all entered boili the singles and doubles
draw, except for Hippensteel. Ninety-sixth
ranked senior Ali Ansari, sophomore Ryan
Haviland, Hippensteel, l.ipskv, Martin,
sophomore Carter Morris and 79th-ranked
senior Scotty Scott were the seven returning
starters, while freshmen Eduardo Cardoso
and Joseph kao both had their collegiate

The team also entered four doubles
teams — Ansari / Scott, Cardoso/Kao,
I laviland / Morris and Lipsky / Martin.
