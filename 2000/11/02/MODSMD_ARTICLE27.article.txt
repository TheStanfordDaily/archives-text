Reviewing the iravel journal of the Stanford women's vol
leyball team for this season, ii becomes painfully evident ili.it
the best trips have not been saved for last.
The No. 17 Cardinal squad (12-9, f>-7 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) took oil yesterday for the Pacific Northwest on its penul
timate road trip of the regular season. Tonight Stanford takes
on Washington (6-14, 1-1 l)and the Cardinal will face Wash
ington State (13-8, 4-8) tomorrow in Pac-10 play.
Stanford will finish off its road schedule when it travels to
Stockton, Calif, to do battle with No. 12 University of the Pa
cific on Tuesday in a non-conference match.

excited, especially with the trip to Washington falling in the

( lasses, and we have to be prepared for delays and snow-ins.
It's definitely not the most looked-forward to trip, but these
are matches that we need to win."
In years past, the annual Washington trip has provided
some of the players with some of their less memorable mo

"A couple of years ago we got logged in up there," recalls
senior setter I .indsay kagawa, the team's captain. "Some of us
missed midterms and it was a pretty unpleasant experience."
For the live freshmen on the Stanford s<|uad, this trip will
probably provide the < learest picture of how difficult it can be
to be a student athlete on the Farm.
Flic older players "tell me what's going to happen and
what it's like, but I know that I just have to try to slay on top of
school .ind my classes," said freshman middle bloc ker Sara
McCee. "I know we have to go up there like any other road
trip, but it's definitely pretty hard."
