### LOUISA HANDLE 
Editors Note: I'liis article is the second oj two covering Stan
ford graduates running for Senate. An article on l/iw
School Prof . Tom Campbell ran two weeks ago.
Alter eight years of representing the most popu
lous state in the nation, Stanford graduate Sen. l)i
-anne Feinstein (l)-( lalif.) wants another opportunity
to serve California from the Senate seat.
In a telephone interview, the 1954-55 ASSU vice
president pointed out that California is the size of 21
other states put together and she works verv hard at
her job.
Raising the minimum wage, passing a Patients'
Bill of Rights and supporting foreign and domestic
drug policies are issues and plans that separate her
from Rep. Pom Campbell (R-Calil.), a Stanford law
professor, Feinstein said.
" I think raising the minimum wage is critical il the
new economy is going to help those on the lowest in
come level," Feinstein said. She also supports the bi
partisan Patients' Bill of Rights. "He opposes every
effort," Feinstein said of Campbell's position on es
tablishing a Patients' Bill of Rights.
On drug treatment, Feinstein takes a more con
servative stance than Campbell. Feinstein opposes
Proposition H(>, I he initiative that would provide pro
bation and drug treatment for non-violent first-time

offenders. Instead, she would in
crease funding for treatment programs and drug
courts, which she says are working In reducing re
cidivism.
" Hi ere is a reason these drugs arc illegal," Fein
stein said. "The) are very bad lot human beings."
Feinstein said thai she has listened to what experts
have to say about the proposition while serving on
the Senate Judiciary Committee and that n "effec
tively decriminalizes the use of hard nan otics in ( a\-
ifornia." She said passing the proposition "makes the
state a magnet for drug use."
"Mr. Campbell has never proposed a single
thing," Feinstein s;n<l ol her opponent s record on
controlling drug addiction, "lie has been iu the
House of Representatives lor longer than I have
[been in the Senate.] I le's had 10 years to do some
thing but he hasn't done anything iu that time."
Feinstein also approves ol $1.3 billion in aid to
(Colombia in an effort to control drug iralfu king. She
points out that the I louse and the Senate have sup
potted the plan as well.
"It's an economic plan, a human rights plan,"
Feinstein said. She said the intent ol Plan ('olombia
is not a commitment of American troops, as (lamp
bell ( barges, but <>l (>() Black I lawk helicopters and
adviers.

Editors Note: I'liis article is the second oj two covering Stan
ford graduates running for Senate. An article on l/iw
School Prof . Tom Campbell ran two weeks ago.
Alter eight years of representing the most popu
lous state in the nation, Stanford graduate Sen. l)i
-anne Feinstein (l)-( lalif.) wants another opportunity
to serve California from the Senate seat.
In a telephone interview, the 1954-55 ASSU vice
president pointed out that California is the size of 21
other states put together and she works verv hard at
her job.
Raising the minimum wage, passing a Patients'
Bill of Rights and supporting foreign and domestic
drug policies are issues and plans that separate her
from Rep. Pom Campbell (R-Calil.), a Stanford law
professor, Feinstein said.
" I think raising the minimum wage is critical il the
new economy is going to help those on the lowest in
come level," Feinstein said. She also supports the bi
partisan Patients' Bill of Rights. "He opposes every
effort," Feinstein said of Campbell's position on es
tablishing a Patients' Bill of Rights.
On drug treatment, Feinstein takes a more con
servative stance than Campbell. Feinstein opposes
Proposition H(>, I he initiative that would provide pro
bation and drug treatment for non-violent first-time

offenders. Instead, she would in
crease funding for treatment programs and drug
courts, which she says are working In reducing re
cidivism.
" Hi ere is a reason these drugs arc illegal," Fein
stein said. "The) are very bad lot human beings."
Feinstein said thai she has listened to what experts
have to say about the proposition while serving on
the Senate Judiciary Committee and that n "effec
tively decriminalizes the use of hard nan otics in ( a\-
ifornia." She said passing the proposition "makes the
state a magnet for drug use."
"Mr. Campbell has never proposed a single
thing," Feinstein s;n<l ol her opponent s record on
controlling drug addiction, "lie has been iu the
House of Representatives lor longer than I have
[been in the Senate.] I le's had 10 years to do some
thing but he hasn't done anything iu that time."
Feinstein also approves ol $1.3 billion in aid to
(Colombia in an effort to control drug iralfu king. She
points out that the I louse and the Senate have sup
potted the plan as well.
"It's an economic plan, a human rights plan,"
Feinstein said. She said the intent ol Plan ('olombia
is not a commitment of American troops, as (lamp
bell ( barges, but <>l (>() Black I lawk helicopters and
adviers.

"Narco-lerrorists arc taking
over the country," said Feinstcin
ol Colombia. She said ilicy al
read) control .in area the si/c <>1
Switzerland and put Venezuela
.did Panama at risk, "li s to out
national interest lo help (Colom

Campbell has socially moder
ate leanings similar to Feinstcin s,
with boili supporting gun control
and legalized abortion.
