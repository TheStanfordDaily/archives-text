"Here, people are stared lor their

you are prepared lor what is inevitably
coming," lie said.
Arnnllo Medina never met 11 is mule
before lie passed away. Nevertheless, he
speaks freels about him, recounting sto
-1 ies of the revereiK e people had lor him
as the priest of his small community in
Mexico.
Medina is even able to replicate man
nerisms his uncle once displayed,
spending I)ia dc los Muertos last year in
Mexico, because ol this experience, his
uncle lives \i\idlv in his mind.
"I'd lieai a different stor) every
dav. ... 1 1 d | be sitting at the table and
something would happen where |l| do
something he used to do, |andj they'd
pick up on it prett\ fast," Medina said.
" They'd say, 'Wow, you didn't even
meet him and this is something he used
to do."
Dia de los Muertos is a celebration in
which the living breathe life back into
the dead through their memories.
For this reason, students tomorrow
night will find somber skulls in equal
compaii) with the calls ol the Stanford
Mariachi and the flowing colors ol Hallet
Folklorico.
