California courts to add
five languages to
interpreter program
IX )S ANGELES (AP) — California's court inter
preter program will add live languages and nearly 200
interpreters, a move that reflects the state's continuing
demographic changes.
The state Judicial Council on Tuesday announced it
will add interpreters for Armenian, Cambodian, Man
darin Chinese, Russian and the Indian language of
Punjabi, the first additions since 1993.
"Everyone is entitled to due process in the courts,
and a strong interpreters program is critical in a state as
diverse as California," state Supreme (lourt (-hief Jus
tice Ronald M. George said.
The Judicial Council wants to boost its interpreter
force — currently 1,108 interpreters in 100
languages —to 1,300 by June 2001, the Los Angeles
Times reported.
The announcement was accompanied by a report
showing that more than 4 percent of California's 33.4
million residents speak no English at all and that 224
languages are spoken in the state.

Federal appeals court
upholds California's skills
test for schoolteachers
A federal appeals court ruled Monday that a test of
basic skills required for all teachers in California can re
main in use, even though the test has resulted in limit
ing the number of minority teac hers in the state.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in a
7-to-4 ruling on Monday, said that the Caiifornia Basic
Educational Skills Test, or CBEST, was a valid test of
skills needed lor being a teac her, although minority
exam-takers have disproportionately received failing
scores. The test, which the state considers to be at the
Hth-to- lOth-grade level, consists of multiple-choice
questions in reading and mathematics and two essays to
measure writing skills.
California has required the exam since 1983 for any
one seeking a license to be a teacher, counselor, or ad
ministrator in the state's public schools. Several groups
representing Mexican-American, Asian-American, and
black prospective educators sued the state in 1992,
charging that the test was culturally and racially biased
and didn't measure specific: job skills.
