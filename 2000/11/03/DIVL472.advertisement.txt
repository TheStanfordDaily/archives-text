Looking fora challenge? Want to do something
that's never been done before? Then consider a career
at Bose, where we've got a history of breakthrough
products — like the Acoustic Noise Cancelling" headset
you see here.
Right now, we're looking for qualified engineers of all
types - engineers who can't pass up a challenge. So
here's a challenge we faced not long ago. It's got some
thing for everyone - a little mechanical engineering,
a little electrical engineering, even some controls. It's the
kifid of challenge we face all the time at Bose, so if you
have fun with it, you'll probably like working here.
Find out what Bose has to offer at our on-campus
Technology Presentation.
The concept:
A noise-reducing headset using a speaker and micro
phone in the earcup to reduce undesired noise.
The problem:
When the earcup is clamped against the head, the
speaker is driving into a highly resonant system. (The
earcup is small compared to low-frequency wave
lengths, but large compared to high-frequency wave
lengths. So the impedance vs. frequency seen by the
driver varies substantially in magnitude and phase.) The
control system must compensate for these resonances -
a tough problem in itself.
In practice, there's always a leak between the person's
head and the earcup, which changes the acoustic trans
fer function. The size of the leak varies with a number of
parameters, including the shape of the wearer's head.
The challenge:
Design a high-bandwidth, high-gain control loop that's
stable even when the resonances vary wildly in frequency.
