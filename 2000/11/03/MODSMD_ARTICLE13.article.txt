On Nov. 3, 1927, The Daily published an
article about a "pajamarino."
"Three-hundred freshmen, clad in paja
mas of various kinds and colors, and carry
ing (laming red torches, marched up the
Row last night in their annual pajamarino
parade, taking time out lor an unscheduled
storm of the Pi Phi house whose members
had assembled as spectators.
"Led by cheerleaders Sergy Klotz and
Scotty Webster, the procession started at
Kncina I lall. The freshmen proceeded first
to Roble I lall, singing Stanford songs to the
accompaniment of a four-piece band . . .
"Before the pajamarino left Kncina, Hob
Fraser stated that ever) freshman is expect
ed to put 15 hours' work and six hours'
guard duty on the Big Game bonfire. Fol
lowing Fraser's speech, Coach I lusky Hunt
and Pete 1 leiser, freshman football captain,
gave pep talks. I leiser requested his class
mates to keep quiet Friday night in order
that the team might get sufficient sleep to be
in condition for the game.
"The whole affair was the most orderly in
years, according to the leaders of the pa
rade."
Bottom line: Three-hundred freshmen marching
up the Row in pajamas? Some traditions should
be revived for the sake of pure amusement.
