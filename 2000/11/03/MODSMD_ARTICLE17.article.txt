## The 						Stanford Daily Candidates aim too low on higher education 
### 
Published Since IHVI

El )l (IAI 1( )N IS ()NK ol I Ik* most im
portant issues in 1 11 is presidential elec
tion, hut not enough is being said about
the rising costs of higher education.
Both major candidates are committed to im
proving America's schools, hut most of their at
tention is directed at secondary education.
This is not surprising; our public school system
has become .1 source of national shame, while
our universities attract scholars from around
the world.
But while our universities are in much bet
ter condition than our high schools, middle
schools and elementary schools, a university
education demands a price tli.it many families
cannot bear. Scholarships, grants and loans
are available in certain cases, but many stu
dents are left out, because they cannot afford
the right to pass through the gales of their

campus of choice.
The skyrocketing cost of tuition across the
nation is leaving more and more people out.
With education playing an ever-increasing role
in our economy, these rising costs are con
tributing to a growing gap between the haves
and have-nots. Costs at their cut rent levels
cause families making as much as $100.000 a
year to feel the pressure.
I lie next president ought to control these
rising costs. A high-quality college education
should be available to every dedicated student.
Unfortunately, the next president is unlikely
to do much to slop the current trend. Neither
the Republican candidate, lexas (iovernor
(leorge W. Bush, nor the Democratic candi
date, Vice President Al Core, propose major
changes to the svstcin. Neither does enough to
ensure that students are more concerned with

their ac ademic burden than with their financial
burden.
Bush's major higher-learning initiative is a
50 percent increase in l'ell grants for low-in
come students. This initiative would result in $5
billion in funding for students of families earn
ing less than $20,000 a year. (lore's initiative is
more ambitious and expensive. He proposes
$.">() billion of t;i\ credits, allowing families up to
$2,800 a year for the payment of tuition and
fees «iikl creating a tax-free account into which
taxpayers c an deposit up to $2,500 a year for
use in future education costs.
Many critics believe that (lore's plan is
geared too heavily towards the middle c lass.
Millions of workers do not earn enough to
pay income tax, so thev would not receive any
benefit from a tax credit. Critics argue that
(lore's plan would not increase the number of

families that can afford college, but rather
make it a little easier for those who can. Bush's
plan is arguably more sensible because it
makes a college education much easier to af
ford lor a significant number of people, even
it it does nothing to ease the pains of the bill
paving middle class.
Although Bush's plan is a better model fora
higher-education, it would have to benefit a
much larger segment of the population and
take a much greater amount of money from
taxpayers to really be a solution.
We are fortunate to live in a society where
there is a system ol universities that employs
bright individuals to tackle the problems they
face in their respective disciplines. What is
unfortunate is that we do not elect leaders
with the vision to make that system accessible
to everyone.
