# SALAD DAYS
## Nader's campaign lie 
### 
I saw Ralph Nadei in Memorial Audi
torium on ()ct. 21'). 1 was very im
pressed. 1 agreed with almost every
thing lie said. I think he would be a
great president. I'm not going to vote lor
him.
lint don't think votive got me pigeon
holed yet. I'm not just another liberal
Democrat who doesn't have the (out age to
vote lor Nader. 'Sou know that slogan, "A
vote for Nader is a vote lot Bush"? I think
that's the most narrow-minded slogan ol
Campaign 2000. I lie fault ol that slogan is

thai it fjn'si(f>l>()se.s that
there are only two real
parties. II you're not vot
ing lor one, then you're
voting lor the oilier.
The (ireen Party, of
course, fights against
thai exclusionary ethic
of Aineric an politics.
The Green Parts is a

credible and relatively
ethical political entity. Ralph Nader is a re
spectable candidate with well-defined posi
tions. II you agree with Nader's well-defined
positions, then von should vote lot him.
But there is one of Nader's positions,
which is reflected on many flyers and
posters around campus, that I find (|iiitc
disagreeable. Listening to Nader speak, I
wast ight there with him until lie said that
George \\'. Bush and Al Gore were essen
tially the same politician.
I know you've seen the flyers around
campus. There's the clever one that
morphs Bush's and (lore's faces together
and implies that "billionaires'' (some con
spiracy, to l>e sure) control them both. And
the sticker that says "Kepublicrat, which is
an equally clever combination of the words
"Republican" and "Democrat." (It must
have l)een a tough < hoi< e, ruling out "I)e
-molican for use on ili.it sticker!) Some less
subtle messages brought to you by the
Green Party include the one that says,
"Same r***mg Difference."
Ilie assert ion that Bush and (lore are the
same person is manifestly false. And the
more 1 think about it, the more offended I
become. Why would the (1 recti Party insult
my intelligence in such a way? It is true that
the Dcukh rats and Republic an alike receive
millions of dollars from private interests. It
is also true that the Green Party docs not ac -
cept solt money donations. But the money
issue alone is not enough to cloud over the
other diflerenc es Ix-tween the candidates.
The Green Party would have us Ixrlieve
that the following issues are peripheral:
abortion, environmental protection, school
reform, welfare, affirmative action, gun

control, hale (times legislation, prescrip
tion drugs, taxation, loreign policy and the
national debt. On these issues. Bush and
(lore hold clearly divergent viewpoints. For
that matter, the Republican Partv and the
Democratic Part) have starkly different
ideas about these issues.
Are these issues peripheral? Are these is
sues dwarfed In the fix I (hat llush and
Gore are both supported by evil billion
aires? No. The I I issues mentioned above
are some of the most important issues to
myself, to Stanford students and to all
Americans.
I hat's not to sa\ that the Green Party
doesn't have better positions on any or all of
those issues. I admire Ralph Nader and I
admire the (ireen Party, lot the most part.
But this campaign tactic is hard to forgive.
I lie (ireen Party claims to Ik- lighting polit
ical apathy, but instead its campaign slogans
and flyers/m/of]of apathv and indillerence.
As if there weren't already enough
under educated young people out there
who don't know enough to distinguish be
tween the candidates! I lie (ireen Parly
comes along and says proudly that there is
no dillcrence. I lie politically apathetic and
indillerent, who know next to nothing
about Bush's and (lore's dillerences on the
major issues, can casil\ believe the (ireen
Party's claim.
II it weren't lor the whole bogus line
about corporate America having one bitch
with two faces, I would vole for Ralph
Nader. I hope the (ireen Party gets the live
percent ol the vote it needs to receive fed
eral matching funds in the next election
(\( le. Maybe then we can hear the progres
sive and liberal message of the (ireen Party
without having to listen to hot air about
how Republicans and Democrats are iden
tical twins with different billionaire
hairstylists.
As it is, I plan to be celebrating with my
dormmates here in Soto as \1 (iore is elect
ed President ol the United Stales on l ues
day. And with the polls s<x lose in I lie weeks
leading up to Klection Day, it's sure to be a
nail-biter.
There are a lot of good liberals and pro
gressives voting lor Nader in this election.
And there are a lot of these same people
handing out flyers and pamphlets saying
there are no differences between Bush and
(iore. But I suspect that few (ireen Party
supporters are so blindly dogmatic in their
loyalty to the anti-corporate cause that they
w ill not join me 111 the celebration.

about corporate America having one bitch
with two faces, I would vole for Ralph
Nader. I hope the (ireen Party gets the live
percent ol the vote it needs to receive fed
eral matching funds in the next election
(\( le. Maybe then we can hear the progres
sive and liberal message of the (ireen Party
without having to listen to hot air about
how Republicans and Democrats are iden
tical twins with different billionaire
hairstylists.
As it is, I plan to be celebrating with my
dormmates here in Soto as \1 (iore is elect
ed President ol the United Stales on l ues
day. And with the polls s<x lose in I lie weeks
leading up to Klection Day, it's sure to be a
nail-biter.
There are a lot of good liberals and pro
gressives voting lor Nader in this election.
And there are a lot of these same people
handing out flyers and pamphlets saying
there are no differences between Bush and
(iore. But I suspect that few (ireen Party
supporters are so blindly dogmatic in their
loyalty to the anti-corporate cause that they
w ill not join me 111 the celebration.
