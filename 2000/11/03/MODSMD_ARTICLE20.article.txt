Joe Simitian is a courageous leader
I iliink our community needs to know
about |oe Simitian's courage in his skillful
handling of the Stanford (ieneral I se I'er
init process. Voters need to know that, in
the lace of incredibly harsh and unfair crit
icism and persecution from Stanford and
its allies, joe stands for Ins beliefs: Joe
Simitian continues to hold to his position
that protection of the Stanford Dish
foothills for future generations is a lair
•ind reasonable exchange lot develop
ment rights.
He knows how important this pastoral
refuge is to thousands of us, whether we
turn to the Dish hills as .1 regulat part of
our daily survival, visit every once in a
while or simply gaze at its gorgeous un
spoiled oak-studded landscape from alar.
I le knows we appreciate that Stanford has
shared these lands with the community,
and he wants to be sure Stanford does not
underestimate just how impottam this ir
replaceable jewel is to all of us.
|oe valiantly refuses to be bullied bv the
powerful people of Stanford University,
who are using every tool at their disposal
to make life uncomfortable lot him. I lie
job of an elected official is to listen to the
people and come to a fair conclusion, and
he did so. It is now Stanford's turn to re
spect joe's decision and thus respect the
democratic process upon which our conn
try is built. Stanford's arrogant lac k of re
spect for the process and for Joe's propos
al underscores the same attitude which got
Stanford into so much trouble in the past

with the government's indirect cost
investigation.
I commend |oeSimitian —land use at
torney, diligent and competent Supervi
sor ,ind candidate for the 21st District ol
the California Assembly. |oe certainly
earned my vole at the Supervisors' public
hearing as he fought to be sure the voice ol
the community was heard despite Stan
lord's bitter propaganda. It is dear to me
that |oe works hard lor a better quality ol
life and a brighter future for all ol us.

Stanford is fighting the good fight
(lei a grip, Palo Alio residents and
"open spate lovers." Reading the letters to
the editor and statements by the Board of
Supervisors, one would think that Stan
ford is just itching to build a nuclear reac
tor or toxic waste dump in the Foothills.
Stanford has been a responsible neigh
bor lor over 100 years, linlike nearly ev
eryone else in Silicon Valley — and the de
veloper who got rich building your busi
nesses and houses — Stanford lias built
conservatively. If the University had built
like everyone else, the discussion would be
moot because there would be no open
space to protect. Why should the Univer
sity be penalized for responsible steward
ship of its lands by having to cHectively
give them up?
The administration has made every
reasonable effort to accomodate the

Board <>l Supervisors. I lie Board is no
longer behaving reasonably. If the 99-year
plan is adopted In the Board, the Univer
sity should take oil the white gloves and
light. What is an excellent law faculty for
anyway?

Reproductive rights in peril
In recent months, and with the Presi
dential election days away, various politi
cal commentators have argued that the
issue ola woman's light to choose is no
longer politically salient. They argue that
concern lor abortion rights should not al
ien our votes on Nov. 7, and thus mini
mize the importance of reproductive
rights and freedoms.
We find this position disturbing and
misinformed. Perhaps one day, all forms
of reproductive control will be safe, legal
and accessible to all people. We are not
there yet. I he threat ol losing what repro
ductive freedom we clo have is real, and
each person's vote in this election is criti
cal. Protecting Roe vs. Wade and the le
gality of abortion has been the most high
profile choice-related issue in the debates
and the news, but true reproductive free
dom is broader and more nuanced than
this locus suggests.
