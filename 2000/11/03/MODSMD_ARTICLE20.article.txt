Joe Simitian is a courageous leader
I iliink our community needs to know
about |oe Simitian's courage in his skillful
handling of the Stanford (ieneral I se I'er
init process. Voters need to know that, in
the lace of incredibly harsh and unfair crit
icism and persecution from Stanford and
its allies, joe stands for Ins beliefs: Joe
Simitian continues to hold to his position
that protection of the Stanford Dish
foothills for future generations is a lair
•ind reasonable exchange lot develop
ment rights.
He knows how important this pastoral
refuge is to thousands of us, whether we
turn to the Dish hills as .1 regulat part of
our daily survival, visit every once in a
while or simply gaze at its gorgeous un
spoiled oak-studded landscape from alar.
I le knows we appreciate that Stanford has
shared these lands with the community,
and he wants to be sure Stanford does not
underestimate just how impottam this ir
replaceable jewel is to all of us.
|oe valiantly refuses to be bullied bv the
powerful people of Stanford University,
who are using every tool at their disposal
to make life uncomfortable lot him. I lie
job of an elected official is to listen to the
people and come to a fair conclusion, and
he did so. It is now Stanford's turn to re
spect joe's decision and thus respect the
democratic process upon which our conn
try is built. Stanford's arrogant lac k of re
spect for the process and for Joe's propos
al underscores the same attitude which got
Stanford into so much trouble in the past

with the government's indirect cost
investigation.
I commend |oeSimitian —land use at
torney, diligent and competent Supervi
sor ,ind candidate for the 21st District ol
the California Assembly. |oe certainly
earned my vole at the Supervisors' public
hearing as he fought to be sure the voice ol
the community was heard despite Stan
lord's bitter propaganda. It is dear to me
that |oe works hard lor a better quality ol
life and a brighter future for all ol us.

Stanford is fighting the good fight
(lei a grip, Palo Alio residents and
"open spate lovers." Reading the letters to
the editor and statements by the Board of
Supervisors, one would think that Stan
ford is just itching to build a nuclear reac
tor or toxic waste dump in the Foothills.
Stanford has been a responsible neigh
bor lor over 100 years, linlike nearly ev
eryone else in Silicon Valley — and the de
veloper who got rich building your busi
nesses and houses — Stanford lias built
conservatively. If the University had built
like everyone else, the discussion would be
moot because there would be no open
space to protect. Why should the Univer
sity be penalized for responsible steward
ship of its lands by having to cHectively
give them up?
The administration has made every
reasonable effort to accomodate the

Board <>l Supervisors. I lie Board is no
longer behaving reasonably. If the 99-year
plan is adopted In the Board, the Univer
sity should take oil the white gloves and
light. What is an excellent law faculty for
anyway?

Reproductive rights in peril
In recent months, and with the Presi
dential election days away, various politi
cal commentators have argued that the
issue ola woman's light to choose is no
longer politically salient. They argue that
concern lor abortion rights should not al
ien our votes on Nov. 7, and thus mini
mize the importance of reproductive
rights and freedoms.
We find this position disturbing and
misinformed. Perhaps one day, all forms
of reproductive control will be safe, legal
and accessible to all people. We are not
there yet. I he threat ol losing what repro
ductive freedom we clo have is real, and
each person's vote in this election is criti
cal. Protecting Roe vs. Wade and the le
gality of abortion has been the most high
profile choice-related issue in the debates
and the news, but true reproductive free
dom is broader and more nuanced than
this locus suggests.
Laws requiring minors to provide
parental notification or consent lor abor
lion are hitting the hooks in record num
bers, and Congress is current 1) consider
ing a bill that would make it a felony to
drive a minor across state lines to be able to
access this vital health service.
Pharmacists, from small-town drug
stores to the national chain Walmart,
refuse to stock emergency contraception.
Eighty-four percent of U.S. counties have
no abortion provider. Only 33 percent of
health insurance plans cover the major
forms of prescription contraception.
Comprehensive sex education is under
attack. As Catholic health care providers
unwilling to offer the full complement of
reproductive services take over secular

hospitals, women become less and less able
to avail themselves of the procedures and
treatments they need to control their bod
ies; these providers refuse tubal ligations
to women who request them and do not
inform rape survivors about the option to
use emergency contraception.
We cannot settle for abortion that is
legal but not accessible, let alone accept the
possibility that abortion may be outlawed.
Voting with reproductive 112 reedom in mind
means voting for equal access to compre
hensive sex education, contraception and
all reproductive services — it is about peo
ple being able to choose their families and
feel good about their sexualities.
Make no mistake, however, in know
ing that Roe vs. Wade itself cannot be
taken for granted. This summer, the
Supreme Court's decision regarding
Stenberg vs. Carhart — the so-called
"partial birth abortion" ban that would

have effectively banned all abortion —
protected our reproductive freedoms by
a one-vote margin. Four of nine justices
voted to outlaw abortion. I his places us
one justice away from losing our rights,
and no amount of popular protest can
sway Supreme Court Justices, who have
lifetime appointments.
The president has the power to appoint
Supreme Court justices. Ik*tween two and
four seals are expected to open in the next
four years. 1 fe also has the power to sign or
veto relevant legislation, issue executive
orders to provide federal funding fora
range vital reproductive health services
that are otherwise out of reach <>l under
served communities, establish rules for
federally-funded clinics, decide whether
the U.S. will keep its promises in helping
hundreds of millions of couples around
the world to have access to family planning
methods and control the fate of RU-48f>.

We challenge those whose complacen
cy could cost us our rights to look at this in
formation and say again that reproductive
choice is not on the line on 1 uesday, Nov.
7. We believe it matters more than ever.
We are all one justice away from overturn
ing Roe vs. Wade, from returning to the
davs of coat-hanger abortions, of the fear,
shame and powerlessness that result when
we cannot control our own bodies, sexual
ities and lives.
()ne justice away from injustice.

Reproductive rights in peril
In recent months, and with the Presi
dential election days away, various politi
cal commentators have argued that the
issue ola woman's light to choose is no
longer politically salient. They argue that
concern lor abortion rights should not al
ien our votes on Nov. 7, and thus mini
mize the importance of reproductive
rights and freedoms.
We find this position disturbing and
misinformed. Perhaps one day, all forms
of reproductive control will be safe, legal
and accessible to all people. We are not
there yet. I he threat ol losing what repro
ductive freedom we clo have is real, and
each person's vote in this election is criti
cal. Protecting Roe vs. Wade and the le
gality of abortion has been the most high
profile choice-related issue in the debates
and the news, but true reproductive free
dom is broader and more nuanced than
this locus suggests.
Laws requiring minors to provide
parental notification or consent lor abor
lion are hitting the hooks in record num
bers, and Congress is current 1) consider
ing a bill that would make it a felony to
drive a minor across state lines to be able to
access this vital health service.
Pharmacists, from small-town drug
stores to the national chain Walmart,
refuse to stock emergency contraception.
Eighty-four percent of U.S. counties have
no abortion provider. Only 33 percent of
health insurance plans cover the major
forms of prescription contraception.
Comprehensive sex education is under
attack. As Catholic health care providers
unwilling to offer the full complement of
reproductive services take over secular

hospitals, women become less and less able
to avail themselves of the procedures and
treatments they need to control their bod
ies; these providers refuse tubal ligations
to women who request them and do not
inform rape survivors about the option to
use emergency contraception.
We cannot settle for abortion that is
legal but not accessible, let alone accept the
possibility that abortion may be outlawed.
Voting with reproductive 112 reedom in mind
means voting for equal access to compre
hensive sex education, contraception and
all reproductive services — it is about peo
ple being able to choose their families and
feel good about their sexualities.
Make no mistake, however, in know
ing that Roe vs. Wade itself cannot be
taken for granted. This summer, the
Supreme Court's decision regarding
Stenberg vs. Carhart — the so-called
"partial birth abortion" ban that would

have effectively banned all abortion —
protected our reproductive freedoms by
a one-vote margin. Four of nine justices
voted to outlaw abortion. I his places us
one justice away from losing our rights,
and no amount of popular protest can
sway Supreme Court Justices, who have
lifetime appointments.
The president has the power to appoint
Supreme Court justices. Ik*tween two and
four seals are expected to open in the next
four years. 1 fe also has the power to sign or
veto relevant legislation, issue executive
orders to provide federal funding fora
range vital reproductive health services
that are otherwise out of reach <>l under
served communities, establish rules for
federally-funded clinics, decide whether
the U.S. will keep its promises in helping
hundreds of millions of couples around
the world to have access to family planning
methods and control the fate of RU-48f>.

We challenge those whose complacen
cy could cost us our rights to look at this in
formation and say again that reproductive
choice is not on the line on 1 uesday, Nov.
7. We believe it matters more than ever.
We are all one justice away from overturn
ing Roe vs. Wade, from returning to the
davs of coat-hanger abortions, of the fear,
shame and powerlessness that result when
we cannot control our own bodies, sexual
ities and lives.
()ne justice away from injustice.

Joe Simitian is a courageous leader
I iliink our community needs to know
about |oe Simitian's courage in his skillful
handling of the Stanford (ieneral I se I'er
init process. Voters need to know that, in
the lace of incredibly harsh and unfair crit
icism and persecution from Stanford and
its allies, joe stands for Ins beliefs: Joe
Simitian continues to hold to his position
that protection of the Stanford Dish
foothills for future generations is a lair
•ind reasonable exchange lot develop
ment rights.
He knows how important this pastoral
refuge is to thousands of us, whether we
turn to the Dish hills as .1 regulat part of
our daily survival, visit every once in a
while or simply gaze at its gorgeous un
spoiled oak-studded landscape from alar.
I le knows we appreciate that Stanford has
shared these lands with the community,
and he wants to be sure Stanford does not
underestimate just how impottam this ir
replaceable jewel is to all of us.
|oe valiantly refuses to be bullied bv the
powerful people of Stanford University,
who are using every tool at their disposal
to make life uncomfortable lot him. I lie
job of an elected official is to listen to the
people and come to a fair conclusion, and
he did so. It is now Stanford's turn to re
spect joe's decision and thus respect the
democratic process upon which our conn
try is built. Stanford's arrogant lac k of re
spect for the process and for Joe's propos
al underscores the same attitude which got
Stanford into so much trouble in the past

with the government's indirect cost
investigation.
I commend |oeSimitian —land use at
torney, diligent and competent Supervi
sor ,ind candidate for the 21st District ol
the California Assembly. |oe certainly
earned my vole at the Supervisors' public
hearing as he fought to be sure the voice ol
the community was heard despite Stan
lord's bitter propaganda. It is dear to me
that |oe works hard lor a better quality ol
life and a brighter future for all ol us.

Stanford is fighting the good fight
(lei a grip, Palo Alio residents and
"open spate lovers." Reading the letters to
the editor and statements by the Board of
Supervisors, one would think that Stan
ford is just itching to build a nuclear reac
tor or toxic waste dump in the Foothills.
Stanford has been a responsible neigh
bor lor over 100 years, linlike nearly ev
eryone else in Silicon Valley — and the de
veloper who got rich building your busi
nesses and houses — Stanford lias built
conservatively. If the University had built
like everyone else, the discussion would be
moot because there would be no open
space to protect. Why should the Univer
sity be penalized for responsible steward
ship of its lands by having to cHectively
give them up?
The administration has made every
