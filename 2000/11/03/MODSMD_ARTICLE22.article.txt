I he Stanford |ournal of Kast
Asian Aflairs will publish its first
issue this winter quarter to create a
campus forum for East Asian issues
and a focal point lot East Asian
studies.
" I here are plenty of East Asia
related student organizations on
campus, but many are centered
around ethnicity or career devel
opment. Also, main of these
groups address Asian-American,
not East Asian, issues." said junior
Josephine Kau, founder and editor
in chief of the magazine.
furthermore, library and other
resources on East Asia, though
plentiful, are located throughout
the Stanford campus. Lau, an In
letnational Relations major with a
locus on modern China, hopes to
alleviate this problem through the
cohesive force of a journal devoted
to East Asia.
The journal will give
"students — often scattered across
the I'niversity's various depart
ments — a chance to meet and
share interests . . . |and] seek out
academic and professional advice
from faculty and alumni with rele
vant experiences," Lau said.
112 unded by the Center for East
Asian Studies and the Foundation
lor the Study of Chinese Philoso
phy and Culture, the journal will

publish student academic work on
Kast Asia, including abridged ver
sions of senior theses, term papers
and I indergraduate Research ()p
-portunity papers. In addition, the
journal will include book reviews,
editorials and coverage of Asia-re
lated events on campus.
"We want the organization to be
more than just the journal," Kau
stressed. She and her co-editors,
seniors l ie Wee lan and Phillip
l.ipscy, will "also organize faculty
nights, lectures, discussions, film
showings and outings."
After coming up with the idea
last winter, Lau and Fan, later
joined by l.ipscy, began working
together to develop and establish
the journal in the spring. Assem
bling a stall has kept them busy
ihis fall quarter. I lie journal has
established a leadership core ol
15 students and an advisory
board of six faculty members
which is si ill growing.
"We've gotten interest from a
wide variety of people, from fresh
men to doctoral students to real
worlders," Lau said.
The journal comes at a time
when more and mote students are
expressing interest in Kast Asian
studies.
Recently, the ('.enter lor Kast
Asian Studies added "gateway," or
introductory, departmental cours
es to attract students.

"We just revamped the pro
gram last year," said Jean ()i, the
c enter's direc tor and faculty advi
sor to the journal. "Having this
group will really help our efforts."
1 he journal will serve as "a nice
outlet lor some quality pieces by
students," ()i added.
"Students are doing very inter
esting, very original research ....
Some of it is very excellent," she
said.
Potential submissions could
broach subjects ranging from U.S.
policies on Kast Asia to the cultural
implications of the Shanghai lash
ion scene. Part of the reason Lau
stai tecl the journal was that sheen
joyed reading the work of her
peers.
"We always read research by
professors in class, but I think that
c an be very remote lor students,"
Lau said. "Seeing research done by
other students will hopefully give
people ideas about the kind of
things they themselves are c apable
of doing, too."
I he journal's goal istostimulate
all students, not only those already
interested in Kast Asian affairs.
"(liven where we are located —
right on the Pacific Rim — Asia is
a growing political and economic
part of the world," ()i said. "These
are really timely issues and I think
they will attract attention fat the
University]."
