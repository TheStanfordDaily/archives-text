What is ilit' allele between the two dock
hands at 3:15?
No, this (|uestion is not lor ;i math < lass. It
was a problem asked during an actual job in
terview with .tn investment-banking litm.
With l.ill recruiting heavily underway,
lliers decorate dormitories, advertising cor
porate presentations that promise golden op
portunities. Students normally dressed in
jeans and I -shirts are now often seen in tai
lored suits walking around campus.
And as of Oct. SO, the Career Develop
ment Center had scheduled approximately
2,900 interviews through its Cardinal Re
cruiting Program, with 279 of these with I I
investment banks and 5914 with 27 consulting
firms.
But what exadly is this commotion all
about? Despite the large amount of interest,
the responsibilities and description of these
jobs remain nebulous to many students.
Consulting and I-banking: separate
worlds
Although consulting and I-banking (as
investment bankingis< ailed)both fall under
a general jobcategoi \ of "business." they are
actually two very different lields.
Investment banks, such as Coldnian
Sachs or Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, ad
vise t heir corporate client son the best meth
ods to raise money, which can occur
through initial public offerings or offering
corporate bonds.
" I liev (an also act as strategic advisers by
helping companies (let ides whether to ac
quire, merge with or sell to another compa
ny," explained co-terminal student Eric
I.iaw, the < hiel financial oflicer for Stanford
Consulting, <i student-run consulting linn
on campus.
Consultants, on the other hand, deal
with more detailed recommendations on
specific problems a company is facing. This
advi< e can include "figuring out why a cer
tain geography is undet pet lot tningthe rest
of the company, hypothesizing why a com
pany is losing market share or what kind of
strategy a company should use when enter
ing or exiling a market," I.iaw said.
Well-known consulting firms include
M< Kinsey, Boston Consulting Croup and

Bain and (lompany.
Most of these major companies employ
general strategists, people who one week
could work on a problem in the apparel in
< lust i \ and the next deal with private equity.
I here are, however, more specialized con
sulting linns: I rilogy, lor instance, deals
with health care consulting; I'KF is involved
with the hospitality industry.
The enticement
Students are drawn to business lor a vari
es ol reasons, including the nature of the
woi k. the opportunity for learning and the
prospect of working with other intelligent
people.
Senior I'art I i Raval, CEO of Stanford
Consulting, is interested in consulting be
cause of the challenge it presents.
"At the surface, you have an ambiguous
problem, and your goal is to find the three
concrete things aliening this problem," he
said.
Others are attracted to the relatively
short-term nature ol programs for hires out
ol (( tllege. New employees are usually hired
lot two years.
"I think it will keep a lot of options open
for me in the future since I don't know what
I want to do for the rest of my life," I.iaw
said. " I he U.S. is a society closely linked to
business, so having business experience can
keep a lot of doors open forme."
And now, the competition to enter the
business field, especially consulting and I
banking, may prove to be greater than
usual.
"Students who were previously interest
ed in business development at start-ups arc
turning back to I-banking and consulting,"
noted Raval. "Especially with the meltdown
ol start-ups this past summer, people see this
area as more solid and secure than the dot
com world."
The application process
"It's been very stressful," said senior co
terminal student Richie kul of the job appli
cation process. "It lias all Ihcii crammed
into one quarter, and so I've devoted the
lirst two months ofmy'senior year almost ex
clusively to the job search. However it's a
worthwhile investment when you realize
that you're paving the first two or three
years of life alter college." Kul is the vice

president ol external aflairs for Stanford
C lonsulting.
Applicants typically use Jobtrak, an on
line svsteni lor submitting resumes and
cover letters to companies that interest
them. These linns then review these appli
cations and c hoose individuals to inlet view,
sometimes using the Cardinal Recruiting
I'rc>grain, an on-c ampus interview schedul
ing system. Companies also provide open
slots for students to sign up for interviews in
,i bidding process.
Celling to the interview stage itself is
competitive.
"()fien limes, there are as many as 200 to
SOO students competing for f>o interview
slots with a company. And, usually, they'll
only take ,S0 students and leave the other SO
slots open lot bidding," Kul said.
Although the interview process is sprin
kled with the perks of free dinners at line
restaurants and hotel slays on the compa
ny's tab, it has its drawbacks.
"I'vebecn missing a lot of classes," senior
Amy Lee said. "I haven't gone toe lass in two
weeks."
At other times, there are simply too many
interviews in one day.
"Monday, October 25," senior Kristen
1 1arris simply replied when asked about the
negative aspects of interviewing. She is re
ferring to a day when live major companies
were scheduled to do their interviewing on
the same day, leaving students to scramble
lrom one interview to the next. "And then
during the rest ol the week, there was noth
ing scheduled," she said.
Interviews lor I-banking linns are typi
cally "lit '-type interviews, centering more
on a person's resume and exploring
whether a candidate would lit in with the
company's corporate culture. It also often
includes brain teasers or other quantitative
pre>l )lems. 11 ie c c>mpanics als( > give j(>b can
didates a c hance to meet with representa
tives and get abetter leel for the company.
"I was ac tually shocked by how much I
didn't like some companies at all after meet
ing tlicit employees," I .ec said.
I lie CDC's Cardinal Recruiting Pro
gram facilitates the on-campus recruiting
process, but it was ac tually only cited as a
means lot finding employment by approxi
mately 20 percent of students in a 1997-9 M
survey.

"Most employers do not interview or ac -
tively recruit students through the ( \)(1 at
Stanford or any other university," s.iid (il)( 1
Director Robert i hirsk. "Some employers
will post their jobs on the Web. ()thers use
dillerent mediums to advertise their posi
tions 01 they prefer to have students contact
them directly about their jobs. A major role
that the( IK '. serves is to teach students how
to target and find the hidden jobs that com
post' SO percent of today's job market."
One approach: Stanford Consulting
For students interested in exploring a
business career, Stanford Consulting pro
vides the promise of gaining experience
with a group based on campus. Stanford
( onsulting is a student-run firm that has of
fered consulting services to businesses such
as 1 rile>gy aticl Fc>gd<>g.c <>m.
In conjunction with firms like Boston
( onsulting (Iroup and Mercer (onsulting,
Stanford Consulting provides in-depth
training modules for its consultants, who are
mostly juniors and seniors. Students are
now being chosen from the pool ol applica
tions that were due Oct. 29. In the winter
and spring quarters, newly selected stu
dents will join seasoned members to work
on cases from actual companies.
"Stanford Consulting definitely is a way
to get some first-hand experience," Raval
said.
Although it is a consulting fit in, there is
high crossover of its alumni into I-banking.
Because of this interest, Stanford (onsult
ing also provides its associates with presen
tations about finance-related topic s, such as
Il'( )s. in addition to conceptual paradigms
used by consultants.
With many job applicants having intern
ships or experiences like Stanford ('.onsult
ing, it would seem that consulting and I
banking is limited to those students with
some business experience.
"I think the misconception is that you
need a strong business background to segue
into these fields," Kul said.
"That's not true, i think that in many
cases, they're just looking for bright, moti
vated people who work well with others and
in pressure-packed situations," Kul added.
Kaval does not completely agree.
" I hey tell you that any major and any ex
periences are welcome," he said, "but it is

important to have exposure to the concepts
you're going i () use in business."
I lowever, Raval added, 1 here are ways to
prepare for your interviews, including in
terview preparatory books you can get at
any major bookstore. This homework is es
pecially important in developing the back
ground necessary to do well in case-study in
terviews, which are more common lot con
sulting jobs. In stub interviews, the appli
cant is given a mock situation. Interacting
with the interviewers, the applicant is able to
ask questions alxmt the problem and get an
swers until a conclusion is readied.
An educated decision
According to the most recent statistics
published by the ('.IK I, (> I percent of Stan
ford graduates planned to work after grad
uation and, of these, 31.2 percent said they
were entering general business careers, the
highest industry in which students had ac -
cepted jobs. Kngincering and computer sci
ence came in second, drawing 19.3 percent
of students.
Tliirsk expressed concern over the em
phasis on I-banking and consulting firms.
"Students' knowledge about the many
options available to them in the work place
is extremely limited. Kvery year we see this
phenomenon," Thii sk said. "On one hand
these jobs are great for some people. ()n the
other hand some students Ijecome so preoc
cupied with these field that they don't stop
to consider other great options. We antic i
pate that after the fall recruiting season, we'll
see students who did not get the job offers
coming to the CDC to deal with the ques
t i< >ns c >1 what are I he c >pt i< >ns, how can my in
terest lx- incorporated into my c areer."
I he CDC oilers a variety of services for
students, including counselors who can help
students clarify their interests and explore
the job market, a career resource library
with information about a variety of different
c areer fields and alumni databases to help
students network in their field of interest.
"Jobs in general business, journalism,
public relations, government, not-for-prof
it. entertainment, education, et cetera are
found more effectively by students re
searching employers and approaching
them directly," Thirsk said. "Those organi
zations that recruit on campus are the
proverbial tip of the iceberg."
