## Bowl dreams on the ropes in LA 
### MATT LONG STAFF WRITER 
Like any college students, the
Stanford football team can't help
but dream of palm trees, beaches
.ind shaved ice as < hilly weather sets
in. If the Cardinal wants to pack its
suitcases fora 1 lawaiian postseason
vacation, however, it'll take some
thing the team hasn't accomplished
all year: three wins in a row.
Currently Stanford is tied for
fourth place in the Pacific 10 Con
ference with UCLA, Arizona State
and Cal at 2-3. The Cardinal
squares off against each of these
teams in the next three games, and
picking up three wins would most
likely mean a trip to the islands for
the Oahu or Aloha Bowls as the
fourth or fifth place team in the
IV-10.
Regardless of where it finishes
in the conference, the 3-5 (Cardinal
needs six wins to qualify for the
postseason, meaning another loss

and'Scanford can s*a\ goodhytvro
any chance at a howl.
The first thing the Cardinal
needs to pack is a win against
UCIA (5-3), a gutsy team that lias
defeated three ranked schools this
season and has climbed as high as
No. 12 in the rankings. The Bru
ins' wins haven't come easy, hav
ing trailed in all eight of their con
tests, the most recent being a 27-24
comeback upset over No. 23 Ari
zona last weekend.
It's homecoming weekend iti
Pasadena, and the sold-oul Rose
Bowl presents a formidable chal
lenge lor the frustrated Cardinal.
Alter a heartbreaking last-minute
loss to No. 9 Washington last Sat
urday, the Stanford defense needs
to recover and handle UCIA's tal
ented offense with confidence if
the Cardinal has any chance of
folding the Bruins and stuffing
them in its bag lor the Aloha or
()ahu Bowl.

Junior defensive end Matt Leonard and the Stanford defense need a big day
at the Rose Bowl to keep the Cardinal alive fora bowl game.
Sophomore quarterback Cory
Pans is responsible lor leeding the
I).ill to the Bruin receiving corps.
Alter missing three games clue to
injun. I'aus has returned to cook
111> loin straight games with over
\arcK passing, including nine
tout lulovx ns.
I'aus's main target will be junior
llanket Freddie Mitc hell, who pre
sents the most obvious challenge to
the inconsistent Cardinal sec
ondary. Nationally, Mitchell is
ranked second with 115 yards re
i eiving pet game, and he is on pace
to beat the I CIA record Ibr receiv
ing \ards in a seaschi â€” but Mitchell
isonh i he tip of the iceberg.
" I he\ ve got Mitc hell, they've
got .i lot ol guys that are very, very
talented, said Stanford head
< < >a< h I \ rone Willingham. "When
vou have that main guys that have
ilic speed and the ability that they
have, ii makes n very difficult to
locus on just one guy."
()n the positive side, the Cardi
nal laces the Bruins' atrocious run
delense at a time when Stanford's
tailbacks are perlbrming at their
peak. I ClA's run delense rates
ninth in the ionlerence and Stan
lord plans to exploit ibis factor
with senioi (enter /ack Quaccia
coming back from a knee injury.
In its last two games, the Cardinal
lias averaged 1 ( .)0 rushing yards
pel game .tnd six touchdowns,
compared to the lirsi six clashes of

the season where the offense
rushed lor T2 ( .) yards per game
and only a single touchdown.
"We are staying with our run
ning game, which is important.
The confidence of our young men
shows in our running game, our
line, and our backs, and I think the
improvement [shows]," Willing
ham said. "They're starting to
grow, and they're starting to gel,
and they're starting to get better
each week."
Sophomore Kerry Carter and
junior Brian Allen compile most ol
the Cardinal yardage on the
ground, but lately junior quarter
back Randy Fasani has contributed
more and more to Stanford's stable
of runners. All three will need to
make a difference this weekend if
they want the fruits of their labors
to turn into pineapples.
Fasani's bootleg runs and the
toss sweep to Carter and .Allen
should prove equally effective
against UCLA's defense. Running
to the perimeter should help keep
Cardinal ballcarriers away from
Bruins junior linebacker Robert
Thomas, the Pac-1() leader in
forced fumbles who is known lor
his crushing hits.
"The great thing about this is
getting to come back from adversi
ty," said junior right guard Eric
I feitmann. "We're ready to accept
the challenge."
Both teams have learned about
pressure and heartbreak this sea
son, and tomorrow should be no
exception, with the winning team
placing it sell in the driver's seal for
a postseason trip off the mainland.
