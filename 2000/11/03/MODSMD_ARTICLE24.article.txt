## Bowl dreams on the ropes in LA 
### MATT LONG STAFF WRITER 
Like any college students, the
Stanford football team can't help
but dream of palm trees, beaches
.ind shaved ice as < hilly weather sets
in. If the Cardinal wants to pack its
suitcases fora 1 lawaiian postseason
vacation, however, it'll take some
thing the team hasn't accomplished
all year: three wins in a row.
Currently Stanford is tied for
fourth place in the Pacific 10 Con
ference with UCLA, Arizona State
and Cal at 2-3. The Cardinal
squares off against each of these
teams in the next three games, and
picking up three wins would most
likely mean a trip to the islands for
the Oahu or Aloha Bowls as the
fourth or fifth place team in the
IV-10.
Regardless of where it finishes
in the conference, the 3-5 (Cardinal
needs six wins to qualify for the
postseason, meaning another loss

and'Scanford can s*a\ goodhytvro
any chance at a howl.
The first thing the Cardinal
needs to pack is a win against
UCIA (5-3), a gutsy team that lias
defeated three ranked schools this
season and has climbed as high as
No. 12 in the rankings. The Bru
ins' wins haven't come easy, hav
ing trailed in all eight of their con
tests, the most recent being a 27-24
comeback upset over No. 23 Ari
zona last weekend.
It's homecoming weekend iti
Pasadena, and the sold-oul Rose
Bowl presents a formidable chal
lenge lor the frustrated Cardinal.
Alter a heartbreaking last-minute
loss to No. 9 Washington last Sat
urday, the Stanford defense needs
to recover and handle UCIA's tal
ented offense with confidence if
the Cardinal has any chance of
folding the Bruins and stuffing
them in its bag lor the Aloha or
()ahu Bowl.
