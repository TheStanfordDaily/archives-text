for the No. 1 Stanford men's soccer learn, this
year has been no exception. Come tomorrow,
the Cardinal will meet No. 4 Indiana in the (lal
adidas Legacy ('.lassie, in what could possibly be
the biggest game of the season.
For the lirst nine weeks Stanford has taken
down opponents left and right while slowly
moving tip the Soccer America rankings from
No. 15 to No. 1, beating teams like No. 15
Washington and former No. 1 UCIA.

against a very good team. When you get the
chance to play a team like Indiana whose
record stands for itself, it's all the better. 1 ex
pect to be busy, and I'm looking forward to
that. I know it will be a big test."
I lie last meeting between these two teams
came in 1998, when Stanford saw its season
come to an end in tlie NCAA Championship
game with a 3-1 loss to the I loosiers. I his time,
the (Cardinal will attempt to capture its first win
in six attempts against Indiana.

iliis, especially with the playoffs just two weeks
away," said senior forward Corey Woolfolk.

squad going against an Indiana team, and 1
think we really believe in the system, the talent
that we have and our depth. It's all going to be
put to the tesi from this game onward and I
think we all know that."

to get ready. We'll definitely be itching to play,
and getting another shot at [Indiana] while
they are again ranked towards the top of the
nation is a wonderful opportunity for those of
us who lost two years ago. We're much more
confident than we were the last time we met
this team, and everyone in the program is ex
tremely excited fora great game."
