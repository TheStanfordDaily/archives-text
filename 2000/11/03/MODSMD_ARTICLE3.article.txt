### MEGAN KNIZE EDITORIAL STAFF 
ASS I' President Seth Newion and
Vice President Malia Villegas have
begun work on a proposal thai may not
take elletl lor two and a half years.
Newton and Villegas, both seniors,
met last month with Hoard of Trustees
chair Isaac Stein to raise questions about
student representation on the Hoard.
Newion and Villegas said I hey want to
present a report to the Hoard about dif
ferent models of student representation.
I he models have varying degrees of stu
dent involvement, including a focus on
young alumni board members.
I he next set of Hoard representa
tives— two over the age of 35 and two
under 35 — won't be elected until 2003.
I he Hoard has a maximum membership
of 35.
Last spring, the Newton / Villegas
slate campaigned on the issue of student
representation and this summer they
met with Stein.
"This is something we need to do, to
present it in the right way with the new

administration, Villegas said.
I lie pair will focus on representation
models at Cornell, Duke and Princeton.
" I I lis would be highly beneficial for
the Hoard," Newton said, adding that
students have a unique perspective and
should be more involved.
Students have tried for 30 years to
gain a student representative on the
Hoard, but Stein said such representa
tion would be contrary to the Board's
purpose.
"Personally, 1 don't believe student
trustees are sensible any more than fac
ulty trustees are sensible," Stein said.
" I lie whole purpose is to have <i group
which is separate from current operating
issues with the I Diversity."
Stein s.iid the Hoard already has stu
dent members on most committees and
the majority of the meeting time is done
through these committees.
" The Hoard is charged with the long
term management ol the University," he
said. "People may feel strongly about
freshmen not having cars, but it's not an
issue the Hoard of Trustees will spend
any time talking about."

Siein also said n's not feasible (<> have
a student on the Hoard, because it takes
time Ibi Hoard members to learn about
how the Hoard functions. Terms lor the
Hoard run lor live or 10 years.
Stein said Newton and Villegas have
asked a "reasonable question, and he
will bring up the issue ol how the
younger representatives are chosen.
Stein said the ASSU representatives
want to make sure the entire applicant
pool of under-35 members is being ade
quately reviewed when they undergo an
"elaborate election process.
"Is there a significant dillerenc e in the
understanding of( urrent issues between
someone who graduated in I ( .M)2 and
someone who graduated in 19 ( .) ( .)r" Stein
said.
"We're willing to address that ques
tion in a responsive way and give them a
chance to speak," Stein added.
Villegas said many students are inter
ested in her and Newton's endeavors.
"We have mote ... opportunity to
discuss the agenda with particular Hoard
members and to reach out to specific
trustees," Newton said.
