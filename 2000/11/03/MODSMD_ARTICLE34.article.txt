# Redford drenches 'Bagger' in sentimentality
## Will Smith knows golf, Matt Damon is cute, and we will forgive the director for his sins 
### JOHANNA WINANT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
'I'llree truths are immediately
apparent in"The Legend of Bag
ger Vance": Will Smith is magical.
Matt Damon is cute. Robert Red
foi(l is a director who makes both
actors struggle to stay afloat as he
dreiu lies his entire movie in nos
talgic sentimentality.
If "Field of Dreams" met Tiger
Woods, it would be "The Legend ol
Bagger Vance" (based on the hook
l>\ Steven I'ressficld). Matt Damon
plays Kaimulph |unuh, a golden
boy golfer engaged to Adele ((Iliar
li/.e Theron), the blonde belle ol
|a/./. Age Savannah. World War I
rolls around, |tmuh enlists, be

comes shell-shocked and disap
pears from the sight of Adele and
Savannah lot 10 years. When he re
turns, he is scruffy, fond of drinking
and playing cards and has lost his
golf swing.

Meanwhile, to keep from selling

st<k k market ( rash, Adele persuades
the two best pollers in the country to
come play an exhibition match. I lie
town leaders decide that )unuh
needs to play to represent Savan

nab, but because he is surly, drunk
and unshaven, he refuses.
He reconsiders once Adele
shows up .ind strips down in an at
tempt to persuade him, but he still
can't remember how to golf. Then,
out ol the cold, dark night. Bagger
Vance (Will Smith) appears and,
with <i touch of mystery and a few
wise words, helps Junuh find his
goll swing again, (untili then enters
the tournament, which takes up the
next two hours ol screen time.
I he whole story is retrospective
ly narrated by an old man on a golf
course, looking hack to when he was
ahoy and idoli/ed |unuh. I lowever,
the Bagger Vance narrator is like
the great-uncle no one likes to sit
next to on Thanksgiving — he is in
trusive, he talks endlessly and his

jokes all fall flat.
Redford paints his movie with a
palette of Soutliern verdure and
sunshine. Kvery character is haloed
in soft honey or lit like the sub
ject of a Rembrant portrait. No
doubt, iliis is a pretty movie.
Redford also knows how to make
ihe audience feel warm and iiizzy
inside, although he goes over the
top at times. When |iiniili sinks a
hole-in-one, an angelic choir bursts
out singing.
This movie is a missed opportu
nity for Redford. He could have
made a statement about the (.teat
Depression, but he ( booses to gloss
over it. He could have gracefully
(ommented on the racial inequality
ol the period, but there does not ap
pear to be any significant discrimi

nation in 1920s Georgia in Red
ford's vision.
Redford's heavy-handed and
overly-cautious direction under
mines his movie. However, "The
Legend of Bagger Vance" is re
deemed by the three leading actors.
Despite the fact that Matt Damon
does not quite succeed as a broken
vet, Will Smith plays his role as sar
castic instead of serious and C'harl
ize Theron's accent is shaky, all have
remarkable screen presence and
chemistry. Their excellent comic
timing makes the movie a success as
a light, leel-good romance. But,
through sentimentality, "The Leg
end of Bagger Vance" lets its main
point —the glory of golf and its
function as a metaphor for life -
sag and droop.
