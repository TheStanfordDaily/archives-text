munity, this time identifying the
( ulprit as the film and television
industry. Through sarcasm and
satire, Spike explores how race,
ratings and the pursuit of power
lead to a television writer's stun
ning rise and tragic downfall.
Damon VVayans stars as Pierre
Delacroix, a young writer with an
Ivy League education, who is the
only person of color working for
a new network with floundering
ratings. I)espite several attempts,
Delacroix h.ts yet to see any ol his
concepts go into production.
Now his hoss, the ratings-hungry
cult ure-vu It lire Dun witty
(Michael Rapaport), issues him ;i
searing ultimatum: dome up
with a hot, trend-setting, head
line-making urban hit or get
fired.
Keeling doomed, Delacroix
dec ides to present the most out

rageous, unbelievable farce of
stereotypical comedy he can
imagine — hearkening hack to
the old days of "black-face" min
strels with a variety show featur
ing Man I an (Savion Glover), a
homeless tap dancer, and his
sidekick Sleep and Kat (Tommy
Davidson), who sings and dances.
Some of the most memorable and
poignant scenes are from the au
dition for the show. You want to
laugh but, at the same time, it's
just not funny.
I'lie twist in "Bamboo/led" is
that the minstrel show is a huge
success, l.ven though the show is
incredibly racist, sexist and any
other "ist" you can think of, it
spawns .1 cultural phenomenon.
Everyone loves the show and
buys into the- commercialization
of a white interpretation of black
ness. Lee educates the audience,
as well as Ins c liarac ters, about the
Americ an minstrel show and how
blackness was historically exploit
ed for profit.
Which brings us to the power
ol the movie. The lessons that Lee
teaches about the minstrel tradi
tion orent in the context of today.
Blackness is still being exploited
for profit and misinterpreted for
mass consumption.
Lee spares no targets in identi
fying the agents ol today's ex
ploitation. He talks about every
one from Cuba Cooding Jr. to
fonnny llilliger and 111, ikes 110
apologies for his views.
Though everyone will not
agree on his standpoint, Lee sug
gests that we all need to take <1
look around and see if we've been
"Bamboo/led."
