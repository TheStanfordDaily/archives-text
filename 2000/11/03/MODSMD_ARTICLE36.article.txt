# 'Modernizing' brings new laughs to old story
## New costumes, translation undercut superficiality 
### TIFFANY LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The American Conservatory Theater's inter
pretation of Moliere's 17th-century play "Mod
ernizing Misanthrope," although confusing and
disjointed, is comedic and entertaining.
file story begins with a crew of bird-nosed,
black-robed judges lloating around .1 sparsely
decorated and dimly lit stage carrying a piece of

paper. Confusing to
the playgoer when they
first appear, their role
in the story unravels as
the play unfolds.
As the judges <|iii< k
ly disappear, Alceste, a
man obsessed with
honesty and truth

amidst the super'lieiality and fakeness ol I 7th
century high society, takes the stage with his best
friend, I'hilinte.
Constantly ranting, raving and criticizing,
Moliere humorously paints Alceste as the romantic
idealist so "in love" with his sweetheart, the widow
Celimene, that he ignores her faults, especially the
fact that she embodies the very thing he despises,
17ih-century superficiality.
Alceste's over exaggerated and overacted "tales
of woe," .is well as his need for but refusal to accept
the truth, leaves the playgoer chuckling. The
coinedic aspect of the play is 112 urther enhanced by
( '.destine s harem of quirky and insane lovers that
follow her everywhere and whom she plays off of
each other.

"Misanthrope" lies not in the plot hut in the lan
guage and choice of costuming. Deciding not to
use the commonly accepted translation done hy
Richard Wilbur, (lonstance (longdon retranslates
the script using modern American language but
still keeping the rhyme found in Moliere's origi
nal version.
In contrast to the modernization of the lan
guage, director (larey I'erlofTs costumes are tra
ditional, at least in form. The women appear in
elaborate ball gowns and the men in dose-lilting

waist suits, but, surprisingly, not in tra
ditional colors.
Perlolf said, "What does it mean to
be in a culture where you must match?
What happens when the color scheme
around you shifts and you don't match?
. . .1 wanted to keep that fabulous 17th
century silhouette, but to express it in
colors that are shockingly immediate:

fuchsia, tangerine, mango." These colors, com
bined with fluorescent greens and highlighter yel
lows, shock the audience.
The play is a comedy not only by presentation
but also by Moliere's own categorization, and one
cannot ignore the serious undertones that may es
cape a superficial glance at it. This play makes the
audience think, not only about tlie superficiality
of one's own culture, but also about whether
ideals can survive in society.
