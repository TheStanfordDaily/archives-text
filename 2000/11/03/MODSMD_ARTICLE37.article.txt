## 
### SARAH MEARON STAFF WRITER 
With musings on politics,
porn, poetry and pie, the 1 6th an
nual Film Arts Festival of Inde
pendent Cinema oozes creativity
and controversy. With a cornu
copia of films that seek to break
the rules of traditional cinema,
tht- festival is a vehicle not only to
promote the creativity of passion
ate, gifted filmmakers, but to tell
endearing stories, to provoke
emotions and to connect humani
ty through a few minutes of visual
artistry.
From the tale of a Gregorian
friar living in the Castro to the ac
count ola group of high school
cheerleaders turned activists, the
festival showcases the brave cine
matic experiments of Bay Area
filmmakers. With more than HO
new films and videos being shown
in San Francisco over the next
three days, the festival is un
doubtedly one of the most impor
tant media through which indie
filmmakers can present their craft
to the masses.
The festival'kicked off Wednes
day night at the Castro Theatre
with a preview screening of "Blind
Spot: Murder By Women," a dis
tressing documentary by Academy
Award-winners Allie Light and
Irving Saraf. The film uses one
on-one interviews and dramatic
re-enactments to paint compas
sionate portraits of six women im
prisoned for murder.
Thursday, the festival moved
to the Roxie (anema, where three
programs were presented, in
cluding "Borders and Bound
aries," a collection of films that ex
plores the consequences of cross
ing boundaries of all varieties.
"Islas Hermanas" (Sister Islands)
transports the audience to com
munities on two islands — one in
the U.S. and one in Nicaragua —
that, despite their very different
cultures and lifestyles, have a
symbiotic relationship. In "Work
Ethics," Demetrio Fstrada collects
and recycles discarded bottles
and cans of partying students
from UC-Santa Barbara in order
to support himself and his family.
In doing so, he forges an intimate
relationship with bis community.
I'onight, the Roxie plays host

to two programs— "Frisco
Disco" and "Oh Yeah? Take
That!" — and features a preview
screening of the feature-length
"Seven Sisters: A Kentucky Por
trait" (iX:H() p.m.). which docu
ments the coming of age of seven
women on a rural Kentucky farm
during the Depression. "Frisco
Disco" (C> p.m.) will feature a
smattering of lilms that put life iu
San Francisco under the micro
scope. From .1 blithe study of the

lunacy of driving in "Commute"
to an advisory anecdote that ad
dresses the perils of losing one's
soul in a sea of dot-com mania in
"Modern Life," the joy and pain
of living in the < it\ by the Bay is
captured in this novel collection
of shorts.
"()h Yeah? lake That!" (1
p.m.) is a film that would make
Ralph Nader proud. This whim
sical compilation of political
shorts oilers its connnentarv by

throwing pies in the face of cor
porate America, both literally and
figuratively. The Biotic Baking
Brigade shows us that "The Pic's
the Limit" in their quest to draw
attention to such issues as the de
struction of the redwoods and
homelessness. I hey get out their
message by smearing key lime
and coconut <feme pies on the
112 aces of hapless corporate junkies
and unscrupulous politicians.
"Frank's Monday" takes a pot

shot at consumerism with its
frank commercial parody and
"Special Report" cleverly uses
t lips of nightly news programs
and sound bites from forgettable
1950s exploitation movies to
warn thai folks like led Koppel
and I'eter |ennings report only
what we need to hear.
"Woe and Wonder at f> and
Under" (1 p.m.) kicks oil tomor
row's lineup at the Roxie ('.inertia,
featuring films that examine the
marvel ol childhood. From "Just
Another Saturday Night," which
considers the cycle of domestic vi
olence, to "The Girl Under the
fable," which wistfully captures
the unconventional childhood
crush of a six-year-old, this collec
tion of movies thoughtfully exam
ines the premise that all you ever
needed to know you learned in
kindergarten.
From six year-old first love to
sixteen-year-old teen angst,
"Teenage (R)Evolutions" (3 p.m.)
consists of three short lilms that
delve in to the sometimes tor
tured, sometimes inspired minds
of adolescents and includes a
compelling portrait of teen poet
ry slams in "I'oetic License," as
well as a glimpse of the under
ground hip-hop scene in inner
city Los Angeles in "Beats,
Rhymes and Resistance."
"Involution/ Revolution / Rev
elation" (7 p.m.) is an anthology
of films about the road to self
awareness, whether it involves a
girl's exploration ol her sexuality
by way of Duran Duran and a
home appliance in "Lady Sun
beam" or a man's rellection on bis
existence alter becoming disabled
in "Necessary Action."
Gute girls giggling about men
in jeans in"I Like Men" and a
doctored fragment of a 1970s
porn liliu where the woman has
been replaced with .111 empty, an
imated space in "Removed" both
star in the "Hold Me With Your
Robot Hand" program at 9 p.m.,
which explores the influence of
media on identity.
"Genderama" (II p.m.) rocks
the gender boat with its collection of
video essays that take .1 look at boys,
girls and everything in between.
Both "Grimson" and"A Boy
Named Sue" examine the brutal
