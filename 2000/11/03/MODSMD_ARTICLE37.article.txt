## 
### SARAH MEARON STAFF WRITER 
With musings on politics,
porn, poetry and pie, the 1 6th an
nual Film Arts Festival of Inde
pendent Cinema oozes creativity
and controversy. With a cornu
copia of films that seek to break
the rules of traditional cinema,
tht- festival is a vehicle not only to
promote the creativity of passion
ate, gifted filmmakers, but to tell
endearing stories, to provoke
emotions and to connect humani
ty through a few minutes of visual
artistry.
From the tale of a Gregorian
friar living in the Castro to the ac
count ola group of high school
cheerleaders turned activists, the
festival showcases the brave cine
matic experiments of Bay Area
filmmakers. With more than HO
new films and videos being shown
in San Francisco over the next
three days, the festival is un
doubtedly one of the most impor
tant media through which indie
filmmakers can present their craft
to the masses.
The festival'kicked off Wednes
day night at the Castro Theatre
with a preview screening of "Blind
Spot: Murder By Women," a dis
tressing documentary by Academy
Award-winners Allie Light and
Irving Saraf. The film uses one
on-one interviews and dramatic
re-enactments to paint compas
sionate portraits of six women im
prisoned for murder.
Thursday, the festival moved
to the Roxie (anema, where three
programs were presented, in
cluding "Borders and Bound
aries," a collection of films that ex
plores the consequences of cross
ing boundaries of all varieties.
"Islas Hermanas" (Sister Islands)
transports the audience to com
munities on two islands — one in
the U.S. and one in Nicaragua —
that, despite their very different
cultures and lifestyles, have a
symbiotic relationship. In "Work
Ethics," Demetrio Fstrada collects
and recycles discarded bottles
and cans of partying students
from UC-Santa Barbara in order
to support himself and his family.
In doing so, he forges an intimate
relationship with bis community.
I'onight, the Roxie plays host

to two programs— "Frisco
Disco" and "Oh Yeah? Take
That!" — and features a preview
screening of the feature-length
"Seven Sisters: A Kentucky Por
trait" (iX:H() p.m.). which docu
ments the coming of age of seven
women on a rural Kentucky farm
during the Depression. "Frisco
Disco" (C> p.m.) will feature a
smattering of lilms that put life iu
San Francisco under the micro
scope. From .1 blithe study of the

lunacy of driving in "Commute"
to an advisory anecdote that ad
dresses the perils of losing one's
soul in a sea of dot-com mania in
"Modern Life," the joy and pain
of living in the < it\ by the Bay is
captured in this novel collection
of shorts.
"()h Yeah? lake That!" (1
p.m.) is a film that would make
Ralph Nader proud. This whim
sical compilation of political
shorts oilers its connnentarv by

throwing pies in the face of cor
porate America, both literally and
figuratively. The Biotic Baking
Brigade shows us that "The Pic's
the Limit" in their quest to draw
attention to such issues as the de
struction of the redwoods and
homelessness. I hey get out their
message by smearing key lime
and coconut <feme pies on the
112 aces of hapless corporate junkies
and unscrupulous politicians.
"Frank's Monday" takes a pot

shot at consumerism with its
frank commercial parody and
"Special Report" cleverly uses
t lips of nightly news programs
and sound bites from forgettable
1950s exploitation movies to
warn thai folks like led Koppel
and I'eter |ennings report only
what we need to hear.
"Woe and Wonder at f> and
Under" (1 p.m.) kicks oil tomor
row's lineup at the Roxie ('.inertia,
featuring films that examine the
marvel ol childhood. From "Just
Another Saturday Night," which
considers the cycle of domestic vi
olence, to "The Girl Under the
fable," which wistfully captures
the unconventional childhood
crush of a six-year-old, this collec
tion of movies thoughtfully exam
ines the premise that all you ever
needed to know you learned in
kindergarten.
From six year-old first love to
sixteen-year-old teen angst,
"Teenage (R)Evolutions" (3 p.m.)
consists of three short lilms that
delve in to the sometimes tor
tured, sometimes inspired minds
of adolescents and includes a
compelling portrait of teen poet
ry slams in "I'oetic License," as
well as a glimpse of the under
ground hip-hop scene in inner
city Los Angeles in "Beats,
Rhymes and Resistance."
"Involution/ Revolution / Rev
elation" (7 p.m.) is an anthology
of films about the road to self
awareness, whether it involves a
girl's exploration ol her sexuality
by way of Duran Duran and a
home appliance in "Lady Sun
beam" or a man's rellection on bis
existence alter becoming disabled
in "Necessary Action."
Gute girls giggling about men
in jeans in"I Like Men" and a
doctored fragment of a 1970s
porn liliu where the woman has
been replaced with .111 empty, an
imated space in "Removed" both
star in the "Hold Me With Your
Robot Hand" program at 9 p.m.,
which explores the influence of
media on identity.
"Genderama" (II p.m.) rocks
the gender boat with its collection of
video essays that take .1 look at boys,
girls and everything in between.
Both "Grimson" and"A Boy
Named Sue" examine the brutal

emotions that accompany transgen
der transformations, whereas
"Straight boy Lessons' provides a
droll primer lor those new to the
realm of boyhood.
Sunday at the Roxie, "Left Be
hind" (1 p.m.) leal tires a heart
wrenching portrait of loss, "I low
I (loped When Mommy Died,"
which was directed by a then 15
year-old Brett Blake, who lost his
mother to breast cant er at age I 1.
And Icelanders share post
mortem photographs of their
loved ones and, in the process,
contemplate their own mortality
in "Corpus (lamera."
"I le loves me, he loves me not...
. The Ultimate Connection" (3 p.m.)
is a hodgepodge of shorts that serve
np .i healthy dose of love potion. A
man melts into a puddle of roman
tic delusions when a beautiful
woman walks by in the black come
dy "Shrivelly Lives," and a smarty
pants woman falls in love with an ig
noramus punk-rocker in "Her
Urge." "Marriages in Heaven"
takes a look at arranged marriages
in the Indian culture in contempo
rary America and"St ar" uses an
erotic montage to provoke the ide
alistic romantic in all of us.
A pair of documentaries pose

the question, "What's In a Fami
ly?" (5:30 p.m.). " That's a Fami
ly!" gets the goods from kids who
know what it is like to live in any
thing but a nuclcar family. "See
ing Haiti Through Lalanmi
Selavi' takes a trip to a I laitian or
phanage where live residents tell
I a lt-s of being abandoned and ex
ploited on the streets.
A filmmaker tracks down his
mysterious, long-lost uncle in
"Untle Fugene," and a struggling
bingo parlor patron spins the
prize wheel in "Ralph Ellison's
King ol the Bingo Came," both
part of the program "Have You
Seen Me Lately?" (7:30 p.m.),
which showcases films bent on ex
ploring feelings of alienation in
society. Also ol note is "Window,"
an animated short that contem
plates a life less ordinary.
The Asian Art Museum will
also play host to three programs
on Sunday.
At 5 p.m., "Global Vision" tack
les the issue of change with two
intriguing liltns. Set amid the fer
vor ol the New Year's celebra
tions of 1999, former Stanford
student Hope Hall's stirring film
"every ten seconds" is a commen
tary on how humankind always
seems to be waiting for something
to happen instead of seizing the
day and living for the moment. As
stated in the film, "it was a night

when everything was supposed to
change" and nothing did. From
the status quo to the threshold of
a veritable global transformation,
"Rising Waters" examines the
fate of several Pat ili< Islands tli.it
are at the mercy of rising seas as a
result of global warming, not to
mention tin* politicians who
refuse to enforce lossil fuel emis
sion agreements like the Kyoto
Protocol.
"Kighty Layers of Me" (5 p.m.)
features three films that docu
ment the triumph of women in
various capacities, from the bas
ketball court of the American Bas
ketball League in "Breaking the
Class" to the Brazilian Senate,
where Benedita tla Silva, a former
shanty-dweller, now holds office
in"I was Horn a Black Woman."
The festival closes with a special

A Review of the collection
"Whole Films"
Saturday at 5 p.m.

A program devoted to hu
mankind's intimate relationship
with nature, "Whole Films" fea
tures shorts that masterfully tell
emotional stories, from the pain
of loss addressed in "Hope is the
Thing With Feathers" to the jubi
lation of overcoming a disability
in "Snow Motion."
"Diggins" captures four min
utes of an unadulterated three
some involving a pair of lovers
and Mother Nature. Shot on two
matching Super-8 cameras in the
mountains outside Nevada City,
"Diggins" is a lighthearted romp
through a couple's discovery of
their connection to each other
and the world around them. Set
to upbeat music that perfectly
captures the emotion of the film,
"Diggins" reminds us of how an
appreciation for nature can bring
us closer together.
"Hope is lilt- Thing With
Feathers" is a rousing documen
tary that weaves together person

al interviews with Beau Riley, his
artwork and the poetry he coin
posed following the death of his
partner, David. Through his tes
timony, Beau relays tlit* impor
tance of the spiritual connection
he had with David, a connection
that is integral to overcoming the
anguish he is experiencing over
his own mortality. A powerful
film that transforms tragedy into
.1 newfound spirituality and ap
preciation for life, "112 lope" emotes
compassion and challenges us to
give love and gather love, and,
most importantly, to live life fully.
Carla loth, who suffers from
cerebral palsy, and Mario Solis, a
paraplegic, are featured in Stan
ford ('.ominunications Master's
student Stacy Bloom's "Snow Mo
tion," an intriguing portrait of
two people who overcome their
disabilities to tackle the slopes of
Tahoe. Through the Adaptive Ski
School at Alpine Meadows, both
Carla and Mario have learned
how to negotiate the mountains
of the Sierra and in doing so, have
reconnected with nature and
themselves.
"These two people, at one
time, thought they could never
do this and they're doing it," said
Bloom. "We all have our own
mountains to climb, ft's a whole
lot more rewarding to keep going
than to give up."
