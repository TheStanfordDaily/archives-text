# Cross-over a smooth one for Beenie Man
## Jamaica native crystallizes influences and keeps on dropping syncretic rhymes

l<> understand Beenie Man,
one must iirst understand where he
is coining from. Anthony Moses
David, known as Beenie Man
(which literally means "little guy")
to his audience, grew up in the ten
ements of Kingston, Jamaica. ()hvi
ously talented at the tender age of
eight, he began rapping and dee
jaying years before puberty.
After his first two albums, he had
his breakthrough hit 111 l'.l'.lT with
"WhoAm I (Sim Simma)." I lie sur
prising crossover success of this
dancehall jewel propelled Virgin
Records, in .m un< harac teristic bow
to creative musical expression, to
sign the young rapper to their label.
And Beenie Man has been drop
ping great syncretic hits ever since.

But reggae, dan< ehall and toast
ing (a |amaican-born method of
rapping over beats) purists claim
Beenie has left the gritty stanzas ol
his formative years behind and has
allowed the slick production of a
record and the shameless inclusion

of major American players such as
Redman, Wye lef and Kelis, de
signed to ingratiate his music to
hip-hop and R&B fans internation
ally.
It is only polite, of course, to
make a concession to all those out
there who still view Bob Marley as

the only authoritative reggae voice
tli.it was, is ,md ever shall be. But
Beenie Man has not only incorpo
rated Marley's traditional forms ol
musical expression into this album,
he has also done it well enough to
merit any loss of purity in the
process. The sum <>l the styles is, di
mensionally, greater than its parts
and will please fans of dancehall,
R&B «tii(l reggae alike.
I lie album starts with the bang
of the track "Haters and Fools,"
which is an odd mix of lyrical brag
gadocio and pontificating. "Back
stabbin' fools I think it's time you
comprehend / we're niakin' crazy
money so stop watchin' what we
spend," Beenie spews over a dark,
sputtering melody.
The remix ol "Love Me Now" is
a sure-fire win, with Wyclef lending
his signature 'Tm-still-the-coolest
guy-on-this-track" voice delivery to

the crazy energy supplied by Red
man.
"Jamaica Way" is an extremely
strong song as well. It features Kelis
who, truth be told, is much more
impressive when she is screaming
at the top of her lungs than when
she is earnestly trying to sing a
hook. But the song is carried well
by Beenie, whose delivery punctu
ates the proud eponymous chorus,
"Everything we do, Jamaica Way /
Kverything we say, Jamaica Way."
One of the strongest hip-hoppy
songs on the album is the seamless
"(iirls l)em Sugar," which stamps a
punctuated melody over a synco
pated drum beat. "Me love dem
shape and figga / you know (ley
need (lis nigga," he assures the ob
ject of his allection, while Mya
pours her sugary voice over the
track in a sweet hook. The beauti
fully laid-back ease with which this

song struts its stuff gives it popular
appeal, as evidenced by the almost
cloying amount of radio-play it
gets.
"Heights of Great Men," with its
dirty, descending base beat is just a
wonderful turn-up-volume, roll
down-the-windows track. The bub
bly "9 to 5" immediately follows it
and provides a completely dilFerent
vibe. And "Some Tonight," featur
ing Tan to Metro and bevonte, is a
sly, slow groove.
Many cross-over albums which
endeavor to use dilFerent styles of
music are just mish-mash with
about as much shape and lorm as
projectile spaghetti. But lk-enie
Man's different influences have
crystallized into a real gem — the
kind of compact disc that is just
great to slide in and groove to.
So take off the critical pretenses,
sit back and enjoy.
