lions that Scarface asks on his new
album, "The Last of a Hying
Breed.'' Scarface 112 1 as the uncanny
ability to make you listen closely
to each word that he spits. Sitting
there in the basement, his por
trayals of death and dying, and
life <md living are gripping. Scar
face travels to a place where time
doesn't matter.
As dope as his beats may be,
they are always secondary when
competing with his authoritative
voice that speaks directly to the
listener.
The backbone of Face's sixth
album consists of "The Last of a
Dying btced," "Sorry for What?"
and"In \1 \ lime." In these three
songs, Scarface gels mad autobio
graphical, discussing issues from

his childhood and family to 1 ■ is
struggle and search lor spirituali
ty. ()n tlu* title track, Scarface
takes the listener on a journey in
side the womb of his mother
from the time ol conception to the
moment ol birth. Screaming at
the top ol his lungs in the freezing
cold, baby Scat face raps: "At
three o'clock, 1 1-9-70 / Was the
birth ola dying species, and this I
know / riie truth was in my blood
line, planted in my seed / The last
of this muthafuckin breed."
In"In My lime," Scarface is
sitting around his house looking
out ol his window at a cold,
gloomy day. He's reading Nos
tradamus's predictions about the
end of the world when something
catches his eye: "I glance at my
baby boy, 1 can see this in his eyes
/ I hat little nigga is glad to be
alive / And as the days go by, I
thank C»od lot watchin mine." Al
though his newborn baby boy
wants to live, thoughts keep tun
ning through Scar face's mind
th.it he's running out of time. "So,
one minute we smilin, then the
next we start cryin / cuz we can't
accept that we're born dyin."
The juxtaposition of new life
with imminent death is masterful.
Kven more remarkably, Scarface
comes lull circle in the discussion
oflife and death. The parallels he
draws between the cold, dark, wet
womb ol his mother in"The Last
ola Hying breed" and the cold,
dark, rainy day in"In My lime"
make setise. Some of us think we
ma\ be living to die, while others

think we're dying to live. I he rest
of us haven't thought about it at
all. Si ai late has apparently given
a lot of thought and has come to
the remarkably calm conclusion
th.it: "They tell me dirt is where I
am from / So I guess the dirt is
where 1 11 return / No sorrow, it's
just my turn."
Another outstanding cut on
this album is track number 3,
where Scarface tells a shrink to
take oil his specs, stop looking
confused and "Look Me In My
Eyes." On "It Ain't I'art II," Erik
Sermon provides the funk as
Scarface castigates a 1.1 the "maga
zine niggaz" for overlooking him
in favor of new artists from the
Southside. At one point in the
song he runs down a list of his
classic hits ("My Mind Is I'layin
Tricks on Me," "I Seen a Man
Die," and, "Smile for Me" with
Tupac, etc.) and memorable al
bums ("Scarface is Back," "Diary
of a Madman," etc.). Scarface
makes the point very clear: "II-
Town is mine, I'm lettin yon
know now / So hush with the
chalk talk, claim you gon put it on
the map / When I done already
done that!"
" I hey Down with Us," featur
ing L'(iK, rocks with an old school
style beat as Scarface rips his allies
in the industry, from (lash Money
Millionaires to Roc-A-Fella to E-
Feezy. U( >k has a fast flow and
some serious wordplay.
Some of the other collabora
tions on this album, however, fall
short ol expectations. While it was

good to see Redman, |igga, [ayo
Felony, Da/ and others working
with Scarlace, he comes oft* a lot
stronger on his solo tracks. Still,
yon can't front like Knrnpt

doesn't rip his verse on "O.G. to
Me," and Devin the Dnde and
Too Short don't have you crackin
up on "In & Out." Jay-/ appears
on "Get Out" and engages Scar
face in a creative back and forth
conversational flow, yet it falls
short because it just leaves the lis
tener hanging.
Scarface walks the fine line be
tween madness and sanity. The
soul-stirring nature of this album
makes it clear th.it telling his tale
is therapeutic for him. Yet just
when you think you're like the
shrink who's got him all figured
out, he hits you with this: "They
say that music is a therapy to ease
the mind / But see therapy to me
is to squeeze a nine / Right be
tween your eyes/ While I squeeze
your throat / Chuck you ofF the
side of my boat, and watch you
float."
In the final analysis, Scarface
has created an album that will
emerge as a classic in hip-hop.
Some music is for yesterday, some
music is for today, but Scarface
tackles issues that make his music
timeless. By looking back over the
29 extremely eventful (to say the
least) years of his life and engag
ing in a high level of self-analysis,
Scarface has given the world a last
will and testament that pushes us
.ill to examine our family relation
ships, reflect on our spirituality
and ask ourselves those heavy
questions that we usually avoid.
Scarface may be the last of a
dying breed, but bis music still
has ;i whole lot of living to do.
