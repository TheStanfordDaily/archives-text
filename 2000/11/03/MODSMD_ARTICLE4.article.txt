# Napster bows to pressure
## Popular music service may begin charging for file-sharing services 
### WILL OREMUS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Napster, the controversial on
line mnsic-trading company
beloved by college students,
t eached an agreement I uesday
with Bertlesmann AC 1 ol (iermany
to begin ( barging members lor its
MI'S lile-sharing services.
llertlesmann subsidiary BMCI
has agreed to drop its share in the
Recording Industry Association ol
America lawsuit against Napster
once iht- privately held company
has its paid service in place. It is
unclear whether the agreement
will lead the other lour major
record labels represented in the
suit to make similar settlements.
Napster has been embroiled in
copyright-infringement suits vir
tually from its inception. 1 lie Red
wood (.ity-based compam allows
users to download music tiles from
.1 central server through a peer-to

peer network. In practice, this
means that Napster users can ob
tain virtually am song by am .irtist
without paying for it.
I lie Association lawsuit lias lo
nised on the fact that the songs are
the intellectual property of the
artists and record labels, li the As
sociation lias its way, Napstei will
be ordered by the court to shut
down.
Many in the music industn be
lieve the agreement with BMCI
represents a first step toward legal
and moral legitimacy lor the ser
vice. Bertlesmann press releases
focused more on possibilities lor
the future than the company's be
liefs about the legality ol'Napstei \s
(ui rent services.
Bertlesmann chairman
I liomas Middlcholf'said in a state
ment that Napster has "paved the
way fora new direction ol music
distribution" and "will form the
basis of important and exciting
new business models lor the fu
ture of the music industry."
On-campus Napster users are
somewhat less cheery about the
ramifications of the agreement.
"It's going to suck lor Napster,

because everyone will |ust slop
using it," said freshman Pete
I )eining.
"There are other services that
aren't going to charge." agreed
freshman Victoria Thornton.

These services, which include
Freenet, Gnutella and Scour,
allow peer-to-peer file sharing
that is not dependent on any c en
tral server that could be sluii clown
by court order. Whether the shar
ing is illegal or not. many Napster
users may turn to these alterna
tives in order to avoid having to

pay lor M 1 *1 Vs.
A forum on Napster's Web site
contained several postings b\
users irate that the compam has
"sold out."
" I he day Napster starts charg
ing is the da) when 9 ( .) percent ol
users will start using (inutella,
Freenet or Scour, including me,"
wrote a user who goes by the han
dle "DrNO X."
"II thev try to takea nickel from
me, I II spit on their mother," said
freshman Frit Berger. Berger
feigned sympathy for the record
giants involved in the suit. "I'm
glad we're finally going to start
having to pay to use Napster. It's a
case of millions ol powerful citi
zens taking unfair advantage ol
the helpless record companies."
I he negative reaction was not
unanimous, however.
"I think it had to happen,"
Ihornton said. "I think artists
have a tight to charge lor thcircre
ative work."
Freshman Brill Sandler shared
some ol Thornton's sentiments.
"I think Napster kind of sold its
soul, but it just wasn't feasible to
continue the way it was." Sandler
said. "I don't think it's right [to dis
tribute songs without the artists'
permission], but I am a hypocrite

and do it anyway."
Polls on cnn.com and Nap
ster. com have shown thai many
users would pay for the service if il
were i<> continue to be as conve
nient as il is currently. I lie cnn
poll showed that ;~>B percent ol
Napster users would accept some
lorm of charge in order to contin
ue using the service.
"I would definitely pay for
Napster il it was as useful and con
venient as it is now." Sandler said.
Napster has proposed a $4. ( .)f>
monthly charge lo users in order
to access services which the coin
pain describes ;is "enhanced."
People could still use Napster lor
free, but their services would be
limited.
For instant e, in return for pro
viding Napster with their entire li
brary of songs, BM(i would en
code their MP.Ss with a protection
against free downloads.
Non-subscript ion Napster
useis would have access lo BMC.
MP3s that would work onl\ lor a
certain amount of time, on a trial
basis.
"We want to insure the contin
ued growth ol the Napster com
munity and we want Napster to re
alize its lull potential," read a press
release on Napster's Web site.
"Napster is a business, and as
siKh, we are taking steps to estab
lish a business model, create value
lor our users and push the limits
of our technology."

Napster will remain liee and
unchanged uniil the subscription
service is up and running.
BMC i lias given the company a
loan in order to help establish the
service. I 'mil then. Napster's
membership ol over million
users will probabl) continue to
grow, as it sees thousands ol new
users every day.
Both BMC and Napster are
hopeful that their deal will
prompt I niuTsal. Sony. KM I and
Warner Music to drop their suits
and make similar agreements.
"| BMC i is | our lit si major media
company partner, and together
we're going to work to bring the
other recording companies and
music publishers to the table as
well, read one ol Napster's press
releases.
"We are confident that we can
devise a svstem that will make
evervone happv â€” Napster users,
artists and songwriters, .is well as
record and publishing compa
nies."
I'titil the other labels drop
their lawsuits, the future of Nap
ster remains uncertain.
"All the record companies
should form an alliance with Nap
ster, because thev would be receiv
ing revenue from Napster users,
which is a revenue source that
record companies never had be
fore," junior Ceoffl Isu said. "I his
is simply because many Napster
users don't buy C IDs."
