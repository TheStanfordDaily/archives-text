# A 						BRITISH TRIO PLAYING CATCHY POP? NO WAY!
## Stupid pop isn't Dum Dum 
### VAUHINI VARA 
Ive always resented the term "pop." Be
yond the term's inextricable connection with the
Spice Girls movie and Britney Spears in plaid,
there is something about "pop" that conjures up
horrible images of what could happen if humans
were to be cloned.
But it doesn't have to be that way. Pop has

the potential to be a good thing, and in some
cases, a very good tiling. Case in point: the
Dum Dums. The British trio—Josh Doyle
(vocals / guitar), Steve Clarke (bass), Stuart
"Baxter" Wilkinson (drums) — has already
bit the I op 20 in Kngland twice this year,
with "Everything" and "Can't (Jet Von Out
of My Thoughts," singles from their new

album "It Goes Without Say
ing." Now signed with Amer
ican music giant MCA, the
London-based band plans to
make its U.S. debut.
The Dum Dums are cool
for several reasons. One of
the most significant is that
they are (probably) named

after Iggy Pop's classic "Hum l)um Boys."
This is coolness by association, like when
you look through the music collection of
some random kid down the hall and discov
er that he has that one great alhum that you
thought no one else owned. It makes the
guy ten thousand times more interesting
just for owning it. But coolness by associa
tion only goes so far. You can't ride on it,

and the Dum Dums don't.
The most appealing aspect of "It Goes
Without Saying" is it's diversity. At times,
the trio sounds like a recent incarnation ol
Green Day, at other times, they have the
precocious "yay lor adolescence, yay for an
archy" tone of the New Radicals, and pep
pered in between is a self-conscious ballad

or two, something
like a piano-less Ben
Folds Five.
But this isn't to say
that the Dum Dums
don't have their own
style. From start to
finish, "It Goes With
out Saying" drives

forward with energy and enthusiasm, top
ping a tight guitar-bass-drum foundation
with instrumentation from talented guest
artists. In track 9 alone (the rush-the-stage
and-jump-around "You Do Something To
Me"), they add to the mix trumpet, trom
bone, sax, tambourine and sleigh bells.
The lyrics span a pretty ridiculous range,
from ironic humor — In "Hole in Your

Heart," Doyle sings, "She was a girl lie
loved, he really loved/She's a stupid cow
and he hates her now, oh yeah" — to 'N
Sync-like bubble-gum. "Can't Get You Out
of my Thoughts" could be the album's sta
ple catchy pop song, it's also got the mind
less 'N Sync lyrics like "Look at me girl, I'm
a fool, 1 make you smile / But 1 know I can't
have you / And 1 stare at the stars, wishing
you weren't so far from my arms" and on
and on.

Kut it's good-catchy — the kind where
you know the band is sheepishly laughing at
itself for being such lovesick schmucks. And
that makes them even more endearing.
Plus, they can pull it off 'cause they're from
London. Actually, that is pretty much the
consensus about the entire album.
What they lack in refinement, the Dum
I)uins make up for in "we like you 'cause
you're British" appeal. And that's pretty
much what Brit-pop is all about.
