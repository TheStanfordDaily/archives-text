UN Security Council Resolution 1322, 10-7-2000:
"The Security Council condemns acts of violence, especially the excessive use of force against
Palestinians, resulting in injury and loss of human life; Calls upon Israel, the occupying Power, to
abide scrupulously by its legal obligations and its responsibilities under the Fourth Geneva
Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949."
Rabbi Michael Lerner, editor of Tikkun: "And Jews, still traumatized by our past, seem unable to recog
nize that we are the ones with an army, and that the Palestinian threat could be ended with immediate
withdrawal back to pre-1967 lines."
Amnesty International said in its recent report "Excessive Use of Lethal Force" issued on 19
October 2000. "Unlawful killings from excessive use of lethal force have been the result of the Israeli
use of military methods to respond to riots and demonstrations since 29 September 2000."
The UN General Assembly, by a vote of 92 in favour, to 6 against (Federated States of Micronesia, Israel,
Marshall Islands, Nauru, Tuvalu, United States), with 46 abstentions, adopted a resolution which demanded
that Israel, the occupying Power, abide scrupulously by its legal obligations and its responsibilities under ;
the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 on the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. Further, the
Assembly reiterated that Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory, including Jerusalem, were
illegal and an obstacle to peace.
Human Rights Watch said its week-long investigation of clashes in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and northern
Israel showed repeated use by Israeli security forces of lethal force in situations where demonstrators posed no
threat of death or serious injury to security forces or others.
The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network, the International Federation of Human Rights
and the International Committee of Jurists-Sweden observed: "The continued confiscation of land
and building of settlements in the Occupied Territories is a constant reminder that the Palestinians
are not truly free in their own land, but victims of a form of apartheid. For example in the Gaza Strip
- scene of the some of the worst violence - 20 Israeli settlements with a population 0f6,000 control
42% of the land leaving the remaining 58% to 1.2 million Palestinians."
