So what is ail the hubbub about? Stanford Federal Credit Union is giving
away not one, but two courtside seats to not one, but two of the most popu
lar men's basketball games of the season (against the Cal Bears and the Ari
zona Wildcats). In addition, two Lucky Fans will be given courtside seat
upgrades at each one of the women's home basketball games.
When asked how to participate in the promotion, Roscoe said,"You
cannot win if you do not play."
Excellent advice, Roscoe.You are so deep.
Here s how YOU can enter to win:
• E-mail your name, mailing address and phone number to
whatz@sfcu.org
• Put "Lucky Fan" as the subject line
• Light a candle, spin around three times, recite the Gettysburg
address from memory and call your mother. (Actually, you can
skip this third step. It won't increase your odds of winning in any
way whatsoever, but it may improve your chances of receiving
homemade cookies.)

Dear Q&Q: I was studying an older issue $10 bill the
other day when I noticed a clock on the tower of
Independence Hall. What time is it on the $10 bill?
Signed, Breathless in Anticipation of Your Reply
Dear Breathless,
This is a numismatic question that keeps thousands
of people awake each night. The hands of time on the
$10 bill show that it is 4:10. Magnification of nearly
20x is necessary to see this, but I work at SFCU so I
know.

Dear Q&Q: I recently inherited 10 billion dollars, but
would prefer to go back to my former life of being a
starving student. How long will it take me to spend
that much money so my life can return to normal?
Signed, Stinkin' Rich
Dear Stinkin'
We should all have your problems. If you spend one
dollar every second of every day, you won't run out
for 317 years. I work at SFCU, so I know.

After weeks of study the Dtoart
ment of Deciphering Unreadable
Memos (D-I)UM) at a large East \\y
University has determined that tit
most recent memo (code named
"Weenie") could be attributed to a
group suffering from Member Env]
Syndrome (MES).Victims of MES fe*J
such intense envy of the members »j
Stanford Federal Credit Union that
they simply deny the reality that
members get superior service, low
loan rates, exceptional e-services ant
opportunities to participate in specif
events —like the upcoming Enterpris«
Car Sale.
At this Members-only sale, quality
used cars will be offered for sale.
Members can get preapproved loans
before the sale. Prices are posted
clearly as are service records for each
car Warranties and a 7-day return
policy are also part of the deal.
MES sufferer,Cal Oskie, whines,
"They get all the cool stuff!"
If you have any of the symptoms
of MES, just join Stanford Federal
Credit Union and you'll enjoy all the
cool stuff, too.
