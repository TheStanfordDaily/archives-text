many of the symptoms can fl
be treated with self-care.
Here are six
troubles, and what you can
do about them.
1. Heartburn and
Indigestion
Description: Heartburn (dyspep

backing up into the esophagus,
which connects the mouth to the
stomach. Indigestion is that
hard-to-describe upset feeling in
your stomach.
Causes: Alcohol, caffeine, nico

peppermint, fried and fatty
foods, over-eating, stress, some
medications, and being
overweight.
Self-Care: Avoid or moderate
your use of the above, and eat
smaller meals more frequently.
For heartburn, do not lie down
for four hours after eating, and
raise the head of your bed 4-6
inches. Try an over-the-counter
neutralizing antacid (e.g., generic
Maalox or Mylanta), or an acid
reducer (e.g., Pepcid, Tagamet,
or Zantac).
Seek Medical Advice: If it
doesn't respond to self-help,
persists more than two weeks,
or if you have significant pain or
weight loss.

Causes: Viruses, bacteria, food
poisoning, alcohol, stress,
pregnancy.
