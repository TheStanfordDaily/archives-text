1967
On November (>, 1909, 1 he Daily
published an article about coeducational
residences.
" Its like- a brother-sister relationship
with sexual overtones. Everything is really
relaxed and casual. At first it was sort of like
a family. We see the boys as friends not
dates. If something happens, it just does.'
" That's the conclusion of one resident
after living in a coed dorm for more than a
month.
"Stanford is well into its third full year of
coed living, but even with the experience of a
full \ear under its belt, the success of coed liv
ing is something few are able to measure.. . .
"Coeducational housing has become so
popular that two campus fraternities,
Lambda \'u and Beta Chi, have added
women to their houses, and a third, I*l li
Gamma Delta, has serioush considered the
possibility. . . .
"One of the most significant effects of coed
living Â«incl one which few had bargained for
has been the development of what Psycholo
gy Prof. Joseph Katz calls the 'incest taboo.' It
became obvious soon after coed living was
undertaken that a sort of platonic relation
ship was built up among residents which
broke down the sexual roles students tradi
tionally exercised upon each other."
Bottom line: A brother-sister relationship with
sexual overtones? Incest taboo? Single-sex
dorms are looking more and more appealing.
