pearance will also encourage stu
dents to vote on Tuesday, as
Glaser sees voter turnout as the
linchpin for pro-choice issues in
the election.
"If Stanford students don't go
out and vote, then there's a very
real possibility that turnout will be
low, and when turnout is low, the
Republicans usually win," she saicl.
The concern many Stanford
Democrats express is that .1 Repub
lican victory in tomorrow's election
will mean the overturn of Roe vs.
Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court
decision that allowed women to ob
tain legalized abortions.
Students like Claser believe that
the appointment of new justices in
the next four years, if determined
by a Republican president, could
create a court hostile to the Roe vs.
Wade decision.
"1 don't think that Stanford stu
dents would want to wake up on
November Sand know that the
government was controlling their
bodies and deciding how they
would lead their lives," she said.
Eshoo comes to Stanlbrd after a
year-long eflbrt on the part of Stan

ford Students for Choice, an orga
nization devoted to promoting
pro-choice issues on campus.
Cilaser met with Eshoo in Wash
ington last spring to invite her to
participate in the event.
During their hour-long meet
ing, Eshoo agreed to visit Stan
ford in November and provide
the keynote address at the Elec
tionFest.
This fall, Eshoo sponsored the
Breast and Cervical Cancer Bill,
which was passed recently in the
Senate.
The bill provides treatment for
low-income women suffering from
these diseases. Eshoo has been the
recipient of numerous awards
from pro-choice organizations like
Planned Parenthood.
Matsumura said that issues of
pro-choice are directly related to
women's abilities to advance pro
fessionally and socially in society.
"1 low could women go to school
without being able to control our
reproductive capacities?" she
asked.
"We all have a stake in seeing a
healthy nation with more than just
half of the nation being able to con
tribute in positions of leadership,"
she saicl.
Eshoo leads .1 lineup of speakers
involved in pro-choice advocacy in

the Bay Area.
Byron Sher, a state senator
up for re-election tomorrow,
will speak about the work he has
done on reproductive issues and
the protection of pro-choice
legislation.
Dolly Sandoval, a candidate for
Santa Clara County supervisor,
will relate her experience work
ing last year against Operation
Rescue, a pro-life group that at
tempts to prevent women from
entering abortion clinics. San
doval's speech is intended to in
ject a personal perspective into
the day's events.
Representatives from Planned
Parenthood, Catholics fora Free
(Ihoice and the Religious ('oalition
for Reproductive Choice will also
speak.
Students for Choice lias also in
vited several campus student
groups to set up stalled tables in
White Plaza during the event.
These groups will be available to
provide information to students.
Matsumura stressed the oppor

students to make informed voting
choices.
"We have such a prime location
in time that we really want to share
that resource with people who care
about politics," she said.
