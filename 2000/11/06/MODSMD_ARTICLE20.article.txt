THERE IS POWER in unity,
and students on Stanford's
campus are proving that com
munity ac tivism can save lives.
Indeed, the campaign by Students lot
Enviornmental Action at Stanford
against the production of lethal toxic
chemicals bv area incinerators resulted
iu Stanford Hospital limiting its ties to
the generators of the toxin.
The campaign against toxic waste
dumping in East ()akland has been a sig
nificant controversy lor almost a decade.
Community members lrom Oakland
started working with SEAS in the past
year to pressure Stanford I lospital to
end its relationship with the Integrated

Environmental Systems incinerator and
combat the blatant environmental racism
occurring in our own backyard. The in
cinerators have been emitting clioxin, a
deadly carcinogen that causes severe ill
ness, into the low-income East Oakland
community whose population is almost
entirely composed of people of color.
Environmental racism is a serious issue
<>l which most Americans remain un
aware. According to a 1 992 Environmen
tal Protection Agency report entitled
"Environmental Equity", the portion of
minorities living in communities with ex
isting incinerators is Â«S{) percent higher
than the national average. Many power
ful corporations and organizations clump

their waste into impoverished minority
neighborhoods, because the residents
lack, the financial and political resources
to c hallenge this harmful practice.
We commend the Stanford Hospital
for its promise Tuesday to limit its waste
and phase out PVC waste that has been
harming a community without the
money to protest the deadly abuse. It re
mains essential to note that Stanford
would still be part ol this discrimination
if a coalition of Bay Area and Stanford
groups had not worked for its end.
The members of SEAS and the sup
porters of the campaign against the toxic
waste clumping stand as an example to
all of us, who, as Stanford students, reg-

ularly complete our careers here with
out realizing the responsibility we have
to the larger community as beneficiaries
ofour surroundings. Stanford may seem
independent of the world outside, but it
cannot ignore the plight of workers from
East Palo Alto, communities in Oakland
or pesticide-friendly farms in the Cen
tral Valley, to cite a few examples.
We applaud t he students who dedicat
ed their time and energy to create bonds
with community members outside of
Stanford. Together, they persistantly
fought against the harmful practices of
Stanford Hospital until they succeeded
not only in raising awareness, but also in
bringing about solutions.
