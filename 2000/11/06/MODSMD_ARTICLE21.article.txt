# TURNING AND TURNING
## Conscience can be a pest 
### 
U "w- -jrote your conscience." I his
% / line has become the catch
% / phrase of Ihe last (lavs of
▼ this year's presidential
election, in some cases even overshadow
ing "compassionate conservatism" and"I
am my own man." What it has done is take
what was otherwise a boring election
punctuated by a relatively strong third
party showing into a referendum on the
democratic process.
When we vote, what are we doing? We
might be voting according to our person-

al beliefs, i.e. voting our
conscience. On the
other hand, we might
be voting according to
what we believe is right
lor the country, but not
necessarily lor us as in
dividuals; this accounts
for phenomena like
"BMW Democrats,"

who keep inflicting
higher taxes on themselves. ()r, we might
be voting strategically in an attempt to
shape the country's political establish
ment by ignoring both albremcntioncd
points of view.
Kach of these possibilities takes the
basic idea of "one person, one vote,"
and attaches to it some sort ol philo
sophical purpose. I he voter who votes
according to his or her const ience, who
I call "the sincere voter," attaches a
great importance to his own con vie lions
at a given time and plat e. I bis voter
says,"I vote for what is tight for me."
The voter who votes lor others, and
not himself, adopts a categorical notion
of lawgiving — that is to say, he behaves
how he expects everyone else to behave,
lie says,"I vote for what I think is best
for everyone else."
Finally, the strategic voter believes in
the primacy ol the future and bis abili
ty to shape it, even by performing
counter-intuitive actions. I bis voting
type says,"I will vote for the most ex
treme candidate on either side in order
to force the public to read to an ex
tremist government and overthrow it."
()l course, all of these voting philoso
phies have flaws.
I he sincere voter's strength is that he
refuses to be presumptuous and tell other
people what's best for them; conversely,
he can justify anything based on personal
belief —after all, what's the difference be
tween voting for one candidate because
you are concerned about the environ
ment and voting lor another because
you're in the highest lax bracket? 'I he sin

(ere votet does not necessarily feel an obli
gation to others.
I he presumptuous voter, however,
has the added credibility of altruism. In
deed, he makes decisions according to
some greater formulation of what is true
and good, whi< h allows him to be, for the
most part, ethically and morally consis
tent and justified. Except for cases in
whit h he li.is rather pec uliai ideas about
what's right for other people.
I he strategic voter, on the other hand,
lias iliings so figured out that he knows
exactly what is going to happen four,
eight or twelve years from now. While his
political foresight is admirable, he lias the
unfortunate tendency to gamble — which
is to sav that the future, because it hasn't
happened yet, can be used to justify al
most any political action. The strategic
voter is not constrained by ethics or
morals and tends to be overly willing to
trade the well-being of living people for
what he imagines to be the well-being of
generations to come.
Someone once wrote that in our
modern era, we've exchanged truth for
sincerity. I hat is, we've made being
true to oneself more valuable than
being true to anything else, including
other people. As a result, this has made
"doing the right iliing" more diflicult
than ever. Because doing what's right
by you, while allowed for by democra
cy. isn't enough. Doing the right thing
is more than just soothing a screaming
c onscience — ii requires us to look be
yond out selves but not so far I hat we've
passed from the present into the fu
ture.
What is it (hat democracy requires of
us? Ii insists that we live up to its vision
of human nature: that people are basi
cally decent enough to clothe right
thing even if it doesn't always feel
"right" for them. And the sincere voter
tends to forget that. Sometimes, it be
comes necessary to look outside our
selves to see the realities of the world
that we share with others and then todo
what is right by them in the here and
now. If that makes going out on a limb
and taking a stab at the truth of the pre
sent time and place, then so be it. Espe
cially when the alternative is selling ev
eryone else up the river lor a couple of
years.
So. truth or sincerity. What's it going
to be?
