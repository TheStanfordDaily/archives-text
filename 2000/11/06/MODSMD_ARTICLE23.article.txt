Dish restrictions make community
unsympathetic
Stanford is asking for communil) sup
port for their development plans. But. at
the same lime, they have severelv and ar
bitrarily limited communil) access lo ilie
Dish area. Access to the Dish (uncon
strained by armed guards and paved
streets meant lo serve as "paths') meant a
lot to me, my family, my dogs and our
community of friends, many of whom are
alumni of Stanford. I therefore find il mi
possible to support Stanford's develop
ment plans in the lace of'their unnecessary
closure of and restrictions at the Dish.
Undoubtedly, if they were to take a
more reasonable attitude toward commu
nity access to the Dish, many would be
more inclined to give Stanford the benefit
of the doubt on other development plans.
In any case, it would certainly be a great
goodwill gesture to the comnmnitv if thev
were to revoke the draconian restrictions
which they have placed on community ac
cess to the Dish.

Gore will make a difference
Ralph Nader is simply wrong to say ili.it

choosing Gore over liush won't make a
dillerence.
Al (lore will make a dillerence to
women whose right to choose is on the
line. I he right wing knows quite well that
George YV. Bush can be relied on to ap
point anti-choice Supreme (lourt justices.
And it is beyond doubt that a Bush admin
istration would also burden the right to
choose In reinsiituting his lather's execu
tive policies — policies that required doc
tors al government funded clinics to lie to
women asking lor medical advice.
Al (lore will make a dillerence in ac
knowledging an America of racial and cul
tural diversity. Bill Clinton has a proud
record of appointing minorities and
women to prominent posts in the admin
istration and the judiciary. AI (.ore has
promised to continue ibis line record.
I here's no reason to believe that Cieorge
\V. Bush, despite his lip-set vice, would de
viate from his lather's embarrassing pat
tern of appointments.
Al ( lore will make a dillerence in the
Arctic Wildlife Refuge. Al (lore stands for
strong environmental protections, but
(leorge Bush has promised to turn this
and other precious wilderness sites over to
lus friends and business partners in the oil
companies.
Al (lore will make a dillerence in edu
cation and the arts. Never mind the new

spokesman — the Republican party is still
dominated by people who clamored for
years to abolish the Department ol Educa
tion, cut student loans and censor the arts.
A1 (iore will make a dillerence in eco
nomic fairness. Don't forget that the re
cent increase in the minimum wage was
pushed through In (ilinion / (lore against
the vigorous opposition of the Republi

In short, Al (lore will make a dillerence
for (lalifornia and the nation.
