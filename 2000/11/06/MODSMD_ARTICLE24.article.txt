### 
WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — In the
final dramatic days of a marathon cam
paign, A1 Gore cast his duel with George
VV. Bush as a choice between "two very dif
ferent pathways," with the Supreme (>ourt
and economic progress in the balance. Bid
ding to regain the White 1 louse for the Re
publicans, Bush brandished tax cuts and
Social Security reform while accusing (lore
of practic ing the "politics of scaring peo
ple."
The candidates rallied across a handful
of battleground states yesterday and inten
sified their appeals to core supporters and
undecided voters. Florida and the Midwest
were in the political epicenter.
Pre-election surveys suggested the bat
tle could be the closest in generations, and
indeed the Senate and the I louse were up
lor grabs 100, with Republicans seeking to
retain control. National polls gave a nar
row edge to Bush in the presidential race to
Bush, but (lore's support in large battle
ground states made for an unpredic table
race to 270 electoral votes and
victory.
Tin asking vou not onh for your vote
but for you enthusiasm," (lore said during
one of two stops at black churches in Penn

sylvania. "I want you to go the extra mile."
Bush's exhortations — "The voters are
there, let's turn them out!" — took on spe
cial significance in Florida, where his
brother Jeb runs a state that Bush had ex
pected to put awav weeks ago. In a nod to
Cuban-Americans, Bush sprinkled a
Miami speech with Spanish phrases, in
cluding one that translated to, "We're
going to take Washington, D.C.!" and .in
other that represented his middle initial
.ind his winning hopes for vesterdav: "W!"
Bush, celebrating his 23rd wedding an
niversary on the campaign trail, said, "We
need to get rid of the partisan bickering
that has plagued Washington 1 ).<.. We
need to get rid of the politics of anger
and . . . we need a fresh start, lolks. alter <i
season ol cynic ism."
At the dav's second rally, on a Ibolball
lield at Florida International I nivcrsitv.
Bush accused Clinton and Gore of being
"talkers, not doers" and defended anev\ bis
Social Security and Medicare
pre >posals.
"We need a president to bring Republi
cans and I >cmo( rats together to make sure
the So< ial Securitx svstem works, not onh
for seniors but lor vounger workers as

well," Bush said. 1 he Bush plan would
allow workers to invest some of their Social
Security funds in the stock market, seen In
I )emo< rats as too risky.
Gore started the day in hoth contested
Pennsylvania, where he said that a
woman's right to abortion was on the line.
The Supreme (k>urt is at stake because
the next president, the one you pick Tues
