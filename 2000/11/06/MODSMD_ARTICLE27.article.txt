Greeti Party candidate
could play 'spoiler' role
in close presidential race
WASHINGTON (AP) — Ralph Nader defend
ed his presidential campaign Sunda\ and said he
won't stop urging people to "vote your conscience"
and support him — even ilii hurts A1 Gore.
Defiant and unapologetic. the Green Party can
didate rejected criticism from Democrats who fear
his campaign will help throw the election to Re
publican George W. Bush by siphoning votes that
otherwise would go to Vice President Gore.
"A vote for your hopes, a vote for your dreams,
a vote fora higher expectation level of what our
country can become and what it means to the world
— those are the votes that you need to register, not
the lesser of two evils where at the end of the day,
you're still left with evil," Nader said during his
final campaign rally at the MCI center.
About N,()()() people paid $10 apiece to hear him
speak at the "Super Rally." Similar star-studded
events also attracted crowds by the thousands in
Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, New York and
other large cities.
Nader averages about 1 percent in national
polls, but support lor him is much higher in stales
where the race between Bush and Gore is very
close, including California, Minnesota, Michigan,
()regon, Washington slate and Wisconsin.
His role as a potential spoiler to Gore has put
Nader under increasing pressure from Democrats
who want him to quit. Kven former allies have cam
paigned lor him to get out ol the race, if only in
states where the race is tight.
Nader did not respond to appeals for him to
(Iron out, instead lonising on favored topics, in
cluding corporate influence in government, uni
versal health care and helping the working poor.

1 le did single out the I)emo( ratic party, howev
er. calling ii a hollow part) ill,it tells labor unions,
minorit\ groups and its progressive members
you vegol nowhere to go because we're not as bad
as the Republican party."
What a great choice — a choice between the
bad and the worst. This country deserves better. It
deserves the best for its people, he said.
I lours earlier on NBC's "Meet the Press," Nader
maintained there are no major differences between
the candidates: "I would be disappointed if either
A1 Gore or George Bush are elected."
Ihe sharpest attacks against the Democrats
came from Nader s celebrity friends, including for
mer talk-show host Phil Donahue.
lo our friends in the Democratic party who
wish we d just go away, we have this question —
when can we run.'" he said, adding later: "You
didn t tell Pat Buchanan to go away. You didn't tell
Ross Perot to go away. Why are you telling Ralph
Nader to go away? What are you afraid of?"
filmmaker Michael Moore said it hurt as a
liiend ol Nader's to hear the assaults against him
Irom people we thought we were our allies." He
challenged the crowd to name any legislation by ei
ther (»ore or Bush that "made this country a better
place to live in."
Because ol Nader, he pointed out, the nation has
federal laws to improve the air, water and environ
ment, not to mention seat bells and many other
auto salety features.
I hat is what we have from Ralph Nader and we
owe him," he said.
()lher celebrities lending support included actor
Danny (•lover, rock stats Putii Smith and Adam
\ audi ol the Beastie Boys, and Harvard Universi
ty prolessor Cornell West.
Nader's goal next week is to gel at least fi percent
of the vole to qualify the Green Party for federal cam-
