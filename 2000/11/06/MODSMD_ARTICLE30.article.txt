elite level of rat ing. Though both
reclshirted their freshman cross
country campaigns, they had suc
cessful springs on the track. Robi
son (who redshirted track as well)
clocked a 11 minute, (i second
over ">.OOO meters, and Hawkins
showed his range racing distances
from 1,500 i<> 10,000 meters.
But after a year on the Farm,
l';e two look off for the Mission
ary Training Center in Provo,
Utah in July of 190 S. Robison
stayed for three weeks, learning
the teachings he would spread to
the Afrikaners and Zulu tribes
men in South Africa.
Hawkins stayed longer-two
months-to learn the same teach
ings in I agalog, the dialect he
would be speaking lor the next
two years in the Philippines.
()n then missions, serious run
ning was forgotten. 1 he order of
the da\ was find listeners, teach
them about ilic church, and lead
them to baptism. 1 lie same rou
tine thai, according to Hawkins,
2,000 missionaries are using
every day in the Philippines to
produce nearh 20,000 converts
per year.
In South Africa, Robison alter
nately taught the Mormon doc
trine to members of the privi
leged while upper ( lass and i<>
poverty- stricken villagers living
iu shacks and shanty towns.
In both countries, the mission
aries were well accepted, both as
Americans abroad and as messen
gers of the church. Robison said
that the Zulu people were espe
cially warm, and I lawkins adopt
ed the nickname "Joe"-short for
(>.I. Joe-as a small tribute to the
American men who freed the
Philippines from the Japanese
after World War 11.
Neither runner could afford

time or effort to train properly.
Work hours for the missionaries
c an run from 9 in the morning to
9 at night, and they must be ac
companied by an assigned com
panion at all times.
After a few failed attempts to
convince his companion to come
along on a run, 1 lawkins resorted
to running laps around a school
yard or a rice field, where his
companion could sit, study with
out losing sight of him.
"I tried to get up and run at
5:30 every morning, but it was so
hot and humid even by (» o'clock,
it ended up being a half-hour
jog," Hawkins said. I wasn't
moving quickly at all."
Robison did even less.
"I'd do some push-ups or
crunches, but that's it,"he said.
flie two-year hiatus put their
running careers in jeopardy.
"1 was looking at my
physique, just thinking 'Man,
I'm getting soft," Hawkins said.
"I wondered sometimes ii it was
worth it. 1 had put my body
through so much to get where I
was in running, and 1 was just
watching it all dissolve."
flie process was especially
tough for Hawkins, who runs
near 100 miles every week in the
peak of his training. That number
dwindled to 20 or 30 miles in the
Philippines.
"In the end, the only real ben
efit to my training was helping to
keep my weight down," Hawkins
said.
flie only contact the two had
with Stanford running was the
approximately once-a-month
correspondence with Lananna
through the mail. They would re
ceive media guides and updates
as to how their teammates were
improving.
"It was interesting to see how
everyone was doing," Robison
said. "1 just saw them raising tlie
bar lor me. I knew I was going to
have to get better and better when

I got back."
Injuly, both returned to the
United States and were back, on
the trails, in a race •<> get in shape
for the cross country season.
Robison, who trains best at
around 50 miles per week, has
had little trouble regaining his
peak condition. After quickly re
turning to his normal regimen,
his impact has been
immediate-the two times he has
raced, he has been among the
Cardinal's top four runners.
Hawkins has faced more diffi
culty as he slowly builds back up
to the mileage he was used to.
His biggest talent, he says, is his
discipline, which has helped him
diligently stick lo his training
schedule. It will be another track
season, he predicts, before lie's
back to form. Despite running
only six days a week (taking Sun
day as a day of rest), both run
ners are quit klv whipping back
into shape.
"They are two years older,
their bodies have changed and
they can handle a little more of a
workload," Lananna said. "But
they're still not where they could
be. They missed a lot of running."
On the road back to the lop,
the two returned missionaries
look to each other for support.
"It's nice to have someone you
can complain to, somebody who
understands why your body is
hurting" Robison said. "Ii has
helped to have someone in the
same boat."
Whether their return lo the
lop level ol collegiate racing will
be complete by the Nov. 20 NCAA
Championship meet is uncertain.
But Lananna says that their con
tributions extend beyond their
loot work.
"I'm very impressed with the
sense of loyally, sense of commit
ment and sense of team that they
have. 1 hey bring something very
special to the table, and we missed
them while they were gone."
