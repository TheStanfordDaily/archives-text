First came the three musketeers,
whose loyalty to a cause and leadership
resonates in folklore even today. Then
there were the famed four horsemen who
led the Notre Dame football team to na
tional glory during the 19305. Most re
cently, Michigan's Fab Five basketball
stats led the Wolverines to a Final Four
appearance in 1989. Hut it is difficult to
come up with a famous group of six ath
letes who led their team to national
prominence.
However, now as the six seniors from
the No. 15 Stanford women's soccer team
approach their linal post-season games

representing the Cardinal, ;t sextet of fe
male athletes represents ,i new group
who has left it.s mark on women's soccer
on tlie Farm. These six individuals were
honored for their contributions to the
program both on and oil the field prior to
Sunday's I -0 win over ()regon State.
Each brings a unique personality and
skills to the group, and together they
have lelt a lasting impression on the pro
gram. Collectively, tliev have defined the
path of the women's soccer team for four
exciting and memorable years. These se
niors have recorded a 48-21-5 overall
record, including two N( V\ tournament
berths and a Pacific 10 Conference title
