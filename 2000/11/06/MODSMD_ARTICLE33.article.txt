# Senior six define soccer by their winning spirit

### WENDI WHITMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
First came the three musketeers,
whose loyalty to a cause and leadership
resonates in folklore even today. Then
there were the famed four horsemen who
led the Notre Dame football team to na
tional glory during the 19305. Most re
cently, Michigan's Fab Five basketball
stats led the Wolverines to a Final Four
appearance in 1989. Hut it is difficult to
come up with a famous group of six ath
letes who led their team to national
prominence.
However, now as the six seniors from
the No. 15 Stanford women's soccer team
approach their linal post-season games

representing the Cardinal, ;t sextet of fe
male athletes represents ,i new group
who has left it.s mark on women's soccer
on tlie Farm. These six individuals were
honored for their contributions to the
program both on and oil the field prior to
Sunday's I -0 win over ()regon State.
Each brings a unique personality and
skills to the group, and together they
have lelt a lasting impression on the pro
gram. Collectively, tliev have defined the
path of the women's soccer team for four
exciting and memorable years. These se
niors have recorded a 48-21-5 overall
record, including two N( V\ tournament
berths and a Pacific 10 Conference title
last year.
"Our seniors have brought a
lot to the team this year, because
they have been a steady inllu
ence throughout the season.
Each of them contributes in dif
ferent ways," said head coach
Andy Nelson.
With a team that starts seven
underclassmen, including three
freshmen, Nelson needs the se
niors to set an example for ihe
younger players. This season,
the six leaders have not only had
to adjust to of a new head coach
— Nelson was appointed last
spring to succeed former coach
Steve Swanson — but have also
had to set the tone on a team
filled with some up-and-coming
(Cardinal stars.
"Most importantly, the se
niors are a big part of the reason
that the freshman can come in
and assimilate so easily. They re
ally look after the freshmen and
make sure that they are settling
in," Nelson said.
Fifth-year senior and co-cap
tain Shauna Itri is the so-called
mother of the group. Itri has
been a part of the program the
longest and therefore often takes
it upon herself to take care of all
of her teammates on and off the
lielcl. Itri not only contributes as
the stal ling center midfielder for
the Cardinal, but she organizes
the team's pre-ganie meals and
acts as the link between Nelson
and the rest of the team.
"Shauna looks out for every
one else on the team, and every
one thinks the world of her. She
is consistent and is always com
peting hard, and she has a great
understanding of the game and
what our team needs to do," Nel
son said.
The team's other captain is se

nior (Ihristy LaPierre, I hi- recipi
ent <>l last year's Most Inspira
tional award, handed out to the
team member who hest embod
ies the qualities of a Stanford soc
cer player. La Pi, as she is known
to teammates and friends, is the
team's emotional leader. She
often comes in off the bench as a
midfielder in order i<> spark the
(Cardinal offense.
"Lapi is always smiling, always
positive, very vocal and does a
great job of keeping everyone in
the right direction," Nelson said.
Senior goalkeeper ('.arl\ Sino
lak has helped set the tone lor
the Cardinal ibis year. Smolak
has had a banner year lor the
Cardinal. She rewrote her own
records lor most saves in a single
season (now 1)1) and her record
of eight shutouts in a single sea
son. She lias a career 1 .OS Coals
Against Average.
"[Smolak] lias such a strong
presence for us back there |in
goal], and she really has been
solid lor us all vear long. She sets
the tone with some key saves
during games that helps us to
keep momentum on our side,
and she knows how to motivate
us to gel up lor the big games."
said sophomore midfielder
Kelsey (larlson.
Backup goalkeeper Kerri
Walsh, from Los Catos, is anoth
er member of the sextet that Ids
her play do the talking. Although
she might not gel <is much play
ing time as her lellow seniors.
Walsh plays a vital role due to
her positive attitude and her
work ethic in practice, according
to Nelson.
"Walsh knows why she's here,
and she is always a pleasure to be
around. She seis a good example
for the rest ol the team with her
hard work in practice. Nelson
said.
Midfielder / defendei katlier
ine I lorney, who went through .1
major foot injury during Ikt

sophomore year, was able to re
turn to the team after hard work
in <m extensive rehabilitation
program.
"Her work ethic is just unbe
lievable, and she is always wot k
ing so hard in practice. When she
has gotten on the field for us this
year, she has done a good |« >1 >,
.ukl she does a great job to set an
example for evervone on the
squad." Nelson said.
I lie final member ol t lie
group is Cclina Del.eon.
DeLeon stopped out ol school
lasi year in order to pursue ad
ventures iu South America.
I pon returning to Stanford in
the spring, she was unable to
compete, because she wanted to
retain her redshiri season. Thus,
Nelson never had 1 lie opportu
nity to see her play. Battling into
the stalling lineup eight games
into the season, DeLeon now
provides the Cardinal with an
other consistent option at center
midficld — the quarterback po
sition of the team — where she
plays alongside Itri. According
10 Carlson, although DeLeon is
quiet, she provides a calm pres
ence in 1 he locker room.
"Cclina is always happy and is
verv likable. She really has been a
pleasant surprise for us ibis
year," Nelson said.
Although Sunday was their
final match of the regular season,
each of the seniors knows that
their contributions to the pro
gram will not be lorgotten. I heir
ability to bring their individual
personalities into leadership
roles not only provides an exam
ple for the younger players to
ec ho in the future, but also helps
Nelson, to communicate with 1 lie
team.
So, maybe there has never be
lorc been a famous group of six
in athletic lore. Bui perhaps ibis
group can create its own
as the team heads into the |>osi
season.

she might not gel <is much play

Walsh plays a vital role due to
her positive attitude and her
work ethic in practice, according
to Nelson.
"Walsh knows why she's here,
and she is always a pleasure to be
around. She seis a good example

hard work in practice. Nelson
said.

I lie final member ol t lie

DeLeon stopped out ol school

ventures iu South America.
I pon returning to Stanford in
the spring, she was unable to
compete, because she wanted to
retain her redshiri season. Thus,
Nelson never had 1 lie opportu
nity to see her play. Battling into
the stalling lineup eight games
into the season, DeLeon now
provides the Cardinal with an
other consistent option at center
midficld — the quarterback po
sition of the team — where she
plays alongside Itri. According
10 Carlson, although DeLeon is
quiet, she provides a calm pres
ence in 1 he locker room.
"Cclina is always happy and is
verv likable. She really has been a
pleasant surprise for us ibis
year," Nelson said.
Although Sunday was their
final match of the regular season,
each of the seniors knows that
their contributions to the pro
gram will not be lorgotten. I heir
ability to bring their individual
personalities into leadership
roles not only provides an exam

team.
So, maybe there has never be
lorc been a famous group of six
in athletic lore. Bui perhaps ibis
group can create its own
as the team heads into the |>osi
season.
First came the three musketeers,
whose loyalty to a cause and leadership
resonates in folklore even today. Then
there were the famed four horsemen who
led the Notre Dame football team to na
tional glory during the 19305. Most re
cently, Michigan's Fab Five basketball
stats led the Wolverines to a Final Four
appearance in 1989. Hut it is difficult to
come up with a famous group of six ath
letes who led their team to national
prominence.
However, now as the six seniors from
the No. 15 Stanford women's soccer team
approach their linal post-season games

representing the Cardinal, ;t sextet of fe
male athletes represents ,i new group
who has left it.s mark on women's soccer
on tlie Farm. These six individuals were
honored for their contributions to the
program both on and oil the field prior to
Sunday's I -0 win over ()regon State.
Each brings a unique personality and
skills to the group, and together they
have lelt a lasting impression on the pro
gram. Collectively, tliev have defined the
path of the women's soccer team for four
exciting and memorable years. These se
niors have recorded a 48-21-5 overall
record, including two N( V\ tournament
berths and a Pacific 10 Conference title
last year.
"Our seniors have brought a
lot to the team this year, because
they have been a steady inllu
ence throughout the season.
Each of them contributes in dif
ferent ways," said head coach
Andy Nelson.
With a team that starts seven
underclassmen, including three
freshmen, Nelson needs the se
niors to set an example for ihe
younger players. This season,
the six leaders have not only had
to adjust to of a new head coach
— Nelson was appointed last
spring to succeed former coach
Steve Swanson — but have also
had to set the tone on a team
filled with some up-and-coming
(Cardinal stars.
"Most importantly, the se
niors are a big part of the reason
that the freshman can come in
and assimilate so easily. They re
ally look after the freshmen and
make sure that they are settling
in," Nelson said.
Fifth-year senior and co-cap
tain Shauna Itri is the so-called
mother of the group. Itri has
been a part of the program the
longest and therefore often takes
it upon herself to take care of all
of her teammates on and off the
lielcl. Itri not only contributes as
the stal ling center midfielder for
the Cardinal, but she organizes
the team's pre-ganie meals and
acts as the link between Nelson
and the rest of the team.
"Shauna looks out for every
one else on the team, and every
one thinks the world of her. She
is consistent and is always com
peting hard, and she has a great
understanding of the game and
what our team needs to do," Nel
son said.
The team's other captain is se

nior (Ihristy LaPierre, I hi- recipi
ent <>l last year's Most Inspira
tional award, handed out to the
team member who hest embod
ies the qualities of a Stanford soc
cer player. La Pi, as she is known
to teammates and friends, is the
team's emotional leader. She
often comes in off the bench as a
midfielder in order i<> spark the
(Cardinal offense.
"Lapi is always smiling, always
positive, very vocal and does a
great job of keeping everyone in
the right direction," Nelson said.
Senior goalkeeper ('.arl\ Sino
lak has helped set the tone lor
the Cardinal ibis year. Smolak
has had a banner year lor the
Cardinal. She rewrote her own
records lor most saves in a single
season (now 1)1) and her record
of eight shutouts in a single sea
son. She lias a career 1 .OS Coals
Against Average.
"[Smolak] lias such a strong
presence for us back there |in
goal], and she really has been
solid lor us all vear long. She sets
the tone with some key saves
during games that helps us to
keep momentum on our side,
and she knows how to motivate
us to gel up lor the big games."
