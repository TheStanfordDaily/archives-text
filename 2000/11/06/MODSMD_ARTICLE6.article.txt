to start the vouchers in the stale's
worst schools and said that rather

voucher movement, the campaign
has "poisoned the well" lor further
initiatives.
I le disagreed with Moe that of

Proposition 38 Yes!
spokesman Dave Anderson re
sponded by emphasizing the
problems in California public
schools tluit California rank 40tli
in the nation in reading and math
scores. Anderson s.iid that 34 per
cent of ninth graders do not grad
uate 112 rom high school.
"You have to trust in the market
system," said Anderson, who
agreed with Moe tli.it providing
vouchers would force the public
school to improve. He suggested
that private schools have done a
better job of transmitting culture
and thai graduates ol private

menibci Bomani Siwatu discussed
the initiative witßoniani Siwatu
s.nd, "I think the problem in
Proposition 38 is that u lakes the
svstem as a whole and s.ivs thai it is
not working." He noted that the
Ravenswood School District has to
compete with Palo Alto for the
same teachers, even though
Ravenswood receives $5,000 per
student compared to Palo Alto's
$8,000.
"If \on re talking about equality

we ate funded, said Siwatu. He
said that he didn't think that many
students would choose to leave the
Ravenswood schools since test
scores are up and suspensions are
down.
"I wholly disagree that private
schools have better teachers," said
Siwatu. "I think they're dealing
with dilferent students."
Siwatu said that some public
school students come from back
grounds that would make even
Stanford students drop out.
The schools feed every student
in the- district breakfast, Siwatu
said, because some come from
homes where parents are unable
to till out the required paperwork.
I le said that these students cannot
be expected to perform at their
best.
One student asked how the
proposition would get private
schools to t adit ally transform their
admissions processes to help stn
dents in need.
Kiisi responded that not otils
would there be no way to do ili.it,
he thought there was no guarantee
that private schools would not
raise their tuition alter the vouch

Anderson pointed to Milwau
kee public schools, whi< h advertise
that students will read at grade
level ot else the school will provide
a I lee |Mil)li< tutor, as evidence that
vouchct s encotit age public s< hools

to improve.
A student asked Siwatu how be
fell about targeted vouchers.
"Sometimes it is the school district
th.it holds the community togeth
er," said Siwatu, who explained
that he has a problem with target
ed vouchers because they may
cause a school to fail.
I lie forum helped reaffirm
some students in their stance on
Proposition 3N and helped others
decide.
Kris Won Kim, a master's stu

I did already have my stance. I bis

lie said he was disappointed
that Proposition 38 was not written

Prop. 36 would offer new
treatment for drug offenders

Proponents, unhiding Rep.
