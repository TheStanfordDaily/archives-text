Our internships
aren't easy to get into.
Then again,
neither is college.
Congratulations. All the cramming, insomnia and junk food breakfasts have paid off. You're in college
now - and soon, you'll be facing questions about your life. Like what to do with the rest of it.
One thing is for sure, if you're a student of color, with an INROADS internship you could have a serious job
every summer while you're still in school - making contacts and gaining experience in your chosen field of
study..Hey, it won't be easy, but then again if you wanted it easy, you wouldn't be reading this right now.
