1938
On November 7, 1938, The Daily ran an
article called "Democracy Gone Crack-Pot."
"In the lace of political back-slapping
and bandwagon tactics, it would appear that
the people of California do not recognize
that a greater problem than any individual
legislative measure faces them on 1 uesday's
ballot.
"That problem is greater than 1 lam and
Kggs,' is greater than anti-vivisection, it in
volves the thought that perhaps Democracy
has gone too far overboard in allowing such
measures to arise for public consideration.
"It is ridiculous that any small group
could be presumptuous enough to set itsell
up in judgment of centuries of successful
medical research and practice.
"At this point, it is impossible for anyone
to predict the outcome ol Tuesday's elec
tion. Perhaps, the situation is not as bad as ii
would appear.
"But, when the counting is all over Tues
day night, it's sure to be known whether
Democracy has blown its first fuse in Cali
fornia."
Bottom line: Some things never change, even 62
years later.
