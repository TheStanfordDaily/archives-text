Under pressure from environmental
groups, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Ser
vice is proposing to designate more
than 26,000 acres in San Mateo and
Santa Clara counties as critical habi
tat for the Bay Checkerspot Butterfly.
The butterfly, Euphydryas editha
bayensis, listed as threatened on the
federal endangered species list, has al
ready become extinct at Stanford's
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, ap
parently a victim of extremes of
drought and rain — and rampant
suburbanization — over the past two
decades.
