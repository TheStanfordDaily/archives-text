## The 						Stanford Daily Exercise your rights as a citizen: vote today 
### 
Published Since INVl

THK WAI T IS finally over. We've
been inundated with campaign
news since the presidential pri
maries began last winter, but today
we make our choices, in every race From the
presidents to the state assembly to the local
treasurer.
I Ins presidential election promises to be the
(losest since Kennedy-Nixon in 1960. Each vote
< ast w ill contribute to deciding the future of our
nation, so it is imperative that all registered vot
ers m.ike ,i ( hoice and vote accordingly.
We at The Dailv commend a number of stu
dent groups lor working to increase the number
ol votes that the Stanford community casts and
lot educating voters so that they make informed
choices, l hese include the Republican, Deino
< ratic, and Green party organizations on cam

pus, as well as the ASSI Voter Project and Stan
lord In Government, which brought Ralph
Nader to Memorial Auditorium.
This election, the presidential candidates
expended little effort on winning the youth
vote, as evidenced by everything from their
lack of twentysomething-focusecl campaigning
to the absence of serious plans to address the
rising cost of higher education. No doubt this
decision was based upon the low voter turnout
of the 1 cS-to-24 age groups of the past, but this
is hardly an excuse.
A strong voter turnout of this age group in
the election would prove to future candidates
that the youth vote cannot and should not be
ignored. This has particular relevance to Cali
fornia, where the college-aged population is
rising rapidly in number.

We encourage voters to makt* ,i c hoic e in every
race and on each initiative about which they feel
knowledgeable. With the presidential campaign
receiving much attention on campus, lower of
fices and the many referenda have been out of
the spotlight. However, it is important to keep in
mind the power that lower officeholders wield
and the major changes that certain initiatives can
bring about.
Control of Congress could prove to be just
as important as control of the White House
over the next four years, and the race fora con
gressional majority remains as much of a dead
heat as the one for the presidency.
Main important decisions are also made at
the state level. In fact, state governments are
likely to play a more active role in upcoming
years, especiallv if the White House and

Congress remain divided between the two
major parties.
The most important decisions for the Stan
ford community may turn out to be those on
today's ballot initiatives, specifically with re
sped in ban growth and public transportation.
The ultimate decision regarding BAR 1 exten
sion and establishing growth boundaries —
just to name a few local matters — falls to us,
not Congress or the President.
This is the first election for many of us, and
the first presidential election for an even great
ernumber of us. We must take advantage of
the rights afforded us by our citizenship. If we
do not make our voices heard now, there is no
guarantee that they will be heard at all, and
the opportunity for large-scale change may be
lost until 2004.
