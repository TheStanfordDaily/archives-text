### ALAN DAGOVITZ 
Students on east campus con
fronted a burglar in tlicit dorms
last week, bui police have yet to
apprehend a suspect.
Over the course of several
days, Wilbur and Schwab Resi
dential Center were among res
idences burglari/ed b\ a male in
his mid- to late-20s, police said.
1 he burglar took advantage ol
propped front doors and un
locked windows by stealing an
assortment ol items including
compact discs, planners and
wallets.
()ti multiple occasions students
confronted the burglar but failed to
notify any authorities until a stall
member encouraged them to do so.
In a lot ol the cases where we
had students reporting thefts they
had not called the police," said Di
rector of Residential Kducation
jane Camaiillo. "1 want to encour
age people to call [the police] if an
incident occurs."
One Wilbur resident said she
was harassed and followed to her
room by a suspect, where she was
for ced to use physical force and lit
erally push him out. She described
the ni.in as 5' 7" with a mustache,
dark hair, dark eyes, a thickset
build and carrying a backpack. An
other man lilting a similar descrip
tion was seen trying to enter n xniis
at Schwab.
Senior Klita ('.lieung, an ()kada
resident and anothei victim of the
robberies, said that the tliiel
gained access to her room through
an open window.
"The blinds were down and
our door was locked, |but| the
burglar came into our room
through the window that was left
open for fresh air," ( .lining said,
adding that the room studied as
il someone had been smoking

just outside.
Among the stolen possessions
were Cheung's purse, I'alml'ilot
and cell phone. A laptop comput
er locked to a desk was left un
touched.
1 he burglaries prompted a dis
cussion at Okatla's house meeting
during which the dorm's open
door polic\ was amended. 1 lie
front door is now locked during
the day, as well as at night.
In an e-mail sent to students,
Camaiillo implored people to be
more cautious.
"A lot of |the sale!) measures
are] what we would ask students
to do in individual residences,"
she said. "The challenge is that I
can't enforce that .... We al
ready have campus security offi
cers who are looking for these
kind of events or incidents, but
it's hard defeating what stu
dents do."
Based on what is known about
the past incidents, Camaiillo en
couraged students to close their
windows while asleep or awa\
from their rooms. First-floor
rooms and rooms near balconies
and c atwalks are particularU vul
nerable. Additionally, if any stu
dent sees ,« solicitor in the resi
dence or is the victim of a theft he
should not hesitate to contact the
police immediately.
More damage resulted from
the burglaries than missing items.
Stanford students have been
forced to reconsider their attitude
toward sec urity in a way that some
find disturbing.
"It's scary to think how easily
anyone can come into our dorms."
