# I HAVE ISSUES
## Chivalry is dead, hopefully 
### 
dore m\ senior prom I pic ked up
in\ date at her house. As we were
JL-# IfTTvnTnr. hrr mother paused at the
door, |ust to watch its leave, I suppose.
I.aiei I learned that the mother had been
waiting to snap a picture ol me opening
the car dooi loi her daughter to help her
in. lint this Kodak moment never materi
alized. I a< tualh let m\ date open her own
dooi and gel in all In herself. I've been
known to commit other such laux pas. l or
example, I once walked through a door
that \\.is being held open In a woman.

Sometimes I lorget to
walk on the portion ol
the sidewalk closest to
the street when 1 walk
beside a woman.
What a depraved in
dividual I am! It gets
even wot sc. I didn't inad
vertent!) forget to per
form all I he above mascu
line duties; I didn't do

I hem on purpose. Nor do I lament that
chivaltA is dead. On the contrary, I regret
ili.ii it continues to tin iveand look forward to
the da\ when s<xict\ heals it to the ground
.iikl renders n uiierh lifeless.
I hate (hivalry.
I hate it because it undermines the
equalii) ol the sexes. In order to truly be
lieve that men and women are equally ca
pable ol the same achievements in all
spheres ol life, both men and women have
to get nd of the idea of women as weaker
< reatures ot "damsels in distress," the idea
that lies .it the root of all chivalric acts.
I here is nothing wrong with opening a
door lot people asa simple matter ol cour
tes\. Hut wh\ does a man open a door
speeilicalh loi a woman? Probably be
cause he has been lauglit that to do so is
"polite. Win is n so< ialh preferable for
men ratliei than women to brave the dan
gei sol standing < loser to the road, open
ing < <11 doors, pulling out chairs, standing
raihei than sitting and paying lor meals?
Wh\ do women require protection from
these tribulations?
(>nl\ one answer <x < urs to me: Women
are weaker. Women are supposed to ap
plet late 11 it- c ourtesv and respect that men
show ihem through (hivalry. Screw that.
W omen are just as < apable of performing
all these functions as men.
I don't bu\ into the public/private argu
ment that "In m\ publk life (i.e., school and
woi k) I considei women equal to men, but in
im private life (i.e., family, dating, etc.) I
think it's nice to be old-fashioned." It's im
possible to sepal ate private life from the pub
lic sphere. Faster than you can say "sexism,"

the boardroom becomes the bedroom, and a
male executive starts subconscioush think
ing ot lus female co-workers as objects to be
protected (or conquered) rathei than equals
deserving of respect.
W'liv should romance have to involve
c hivalry anywayr What's wrong with an at
traction between a man and woman in
which they mutualh love, protect and re
spect each other in the same ways? I'm also
skeptical of the biological argument that
because women alone can bear c hildren,
the sexes will never be on an equal looting.
Do we really have to be so tied up in phys
icality? It's possible lor a father to involve
himself a great deal in the birthing pro
cess, and although the sexes are obviously
different, thev don't necessarily have to be
treated as such.
1 also don't feel that, on average, men
are physic ally stronger than women. Actu
ally, women are in general much healthier
and hardier than men. as their longer av
erage lifespans evince. And 1 c an certainly
attest to the fact that every day at Stanford
I see just as many women as men who are
stronger than me. As I see it, in this era of
self-defense classes and a multiplicit\ of
weapons, the issue ol strength is beside the
point. Furthermore, I do not feel as if 1
need protection from stronger men and
women shouldn't either.
I he word "chivalry" has its roots in the
medieval notion of a knight on his horse.
It is an ancient term and should be re
garded as an antiquated tradition. Sure, in
medieval times men regarded women
with an almost religious reverence. That's
all very nice, but th.it perspective still ob
jectifies women. I'm not saying that anv
man who believes in performing chivalric
acts today is sexist. I sincerely believe,
however, that those chivalric ads perpetu
ate a mindset tluit hearkens back to me
dieval sexist ideals.
1 have to say that one of the prime
forces keeping chivalry alive is not the
men who practice it but the women who
love (and often insist upon) receiving it. I
do not understand a woman who wants
full-out, across-the-board equality in Un
professional sphere, but morphs into a
"lair maiden'" incapable of ordering her
own meal or carrying her books. My ad
vice to her is that if you want doors to open
for you in the working world, you'd better
start opening your own doors. And you
may as well begin with the restaurant en
trance door next Saturday night.

Do we really have to be so tied up in phys
icality? It's possible lor a father to involve
himself a great deal in the birthing pro
cess, and although the sexes are obviously
different, thev don't necessarily have to be
treated as such.
1 also don't feel that, on average, men
are physic ally stronger than women. Actu
ally, women are in general much healthier
and hardier than men. as their longer av
erage lifespans evince. And 1 c an certainly
attest to the fact that every day at Stanford
I see just as many women as men who are
stronger than me. As I see it, in this era of
self-defense classes and a multiplicit\ of
weapons, the issue ol strength is beside the
point. Furthermore, I do not feel as if 1
need protection from stronger men and
women shouldn't either.
I he word "chivalry" has its roots in the
medieval notion of a knight on his horse.
It is an ancient term and should be re
garded as an antiquated tradition. Sure, in
medieval times men regarded women
with an almost religious reverence. That's
all very nice, but th.it perspective still ob
jectifies women. I'm not saying that anv
man who believes in performing chivalric
acts today is sexist. I sincerely believe,
however, that those chivalric ads perpetu
ate a mindset tluit hearkens back to me
dieval sexist ideals.
1 have to say that one of the prime
forces keeping chivalry alive is not the
men who practice it but the women who
love (and often insist upon) receiving it. I
do not understand a woman who wants
full-out, across-the-board equality in Un
professional sphere, but morphs into a
"lair maiden'" incapable of ordering her
own meal or carrying her books. My ad
vice to her is that if you want doors to open
for you in the working world, you'd better
start opening your own doors. And you
may as well begin with the restaurant en
trance door next Saturday night.
