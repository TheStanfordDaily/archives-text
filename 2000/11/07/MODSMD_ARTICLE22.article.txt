MSAN ad misrepresented quote
1 was shocked and saddened to see a
quote by me criticizing Israeli policy taken
out of context and used (without my per
mission) to bolster an ad that appeared in
The Daily on Nov. 6. That ad concluded
"America should not support Israel" — a
position I absolutely do not support.
I am deeply disturbed by Israeli policy
toward Palestinians and Israeli Arabs, and
think they violate the highest moral lega

cv of the Jewish people and the obliga
tions of our I oral) to "love the stranger."
I do believe that reconciliation with the
Palestinian people will only be possible
when Israel withdraws from the West
Bank and (>aza. But I also believe that the
Palestinian people are deeply mistaken in
using \ iolence to express their outrage at
the Isiacli occupation.
I am firmU committed to non-violence
on both moral and strategic grounds, and
believe thai everyone who supports Pales
tinian rights should urge them to cease
their violence. And I believe that calling
for an end to American support for Israel
is likely to have exactly the wrong conse
quences, strengthening the paranoia of
some Jews who still believe that the whole
world is against us.
Rather, we need a policy that exhibits
compassion both lot Israel and the Pales
tinian people — and that sense of balance
and compassion is exactly what was miss
ing from the ad which quoted me out of
context.

Demand more from your pro-choice
candidates!
In yesterday's lettei to The Daily, Stan
ford Students for Choice encouraged
Stanford to vote for candidates that sup
port the "pro-choice" movement, hoping
these candidates will make abortion "safe,

legal and accessible." Bui isn'i ii time to de
mand more from pro-choice candidates
than a politically correct catch-phrase?
When a pro-choice candidate demands
a woman's right to choose, she should
light fora woman's right to make an in
formed decision, one that is best tor all
concerned. She should fight for objective
counseling for those facing unplanned
pregnancies, counseling that presents all
the options, so that their choice clearly fits
their situation. She should not suppress
information about abortion alternatives
fearing th.it she will lose the support of
pro-choice voters.
When a pro-choice candidate advo
cates that women should have a choice, he
should contribute to the development of
programs ih.it help poverty-stricken par
ents with children. I fe should demand aid
for these parents ac toss the country, in the
form of training, money and services, so
that women lacing an unplanned preg
nancy do not feel like their onlv solution is
to abort their children. I fe should light for
minorities, teenagers and college students
who are more likely to choose abortion
due to economic hardship. I fe should not
simply c laim that the legal right to choose
gives women all the options they need
when the issue is clearly more complex, es
pecially for the poor.
When a pro-choice candidate dec lares
that abortion should be safe, she should
demand that abortionists provide women
with the exact details of the procedure.
