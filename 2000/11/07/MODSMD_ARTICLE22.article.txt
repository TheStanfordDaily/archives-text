MSAN ad misrepresented quote
1 was shocked and saddened to see a
quote by me criticizing Israeli policy taken
out of context and used (without my per
mission) to bolster an ad that appeared in
The Daily on Nov. 6. That ad concluded
"America should not support Israel" — a
position I absolutely do not support.
I am deeply disturbed by Israeli policy
toward Palestinians and Israeli Arabs, and
think they violate the highest moral lega

cv of the Jewish people and the obliga
tions of our I oral) to "love the stranger."
I do believe that reconciliation with the
Palestinian people will only be possible
when Israel withdraws from the West
Bank and (>aza. But I also believe that the
Palestinian people are deeply mistaken in
using \ iolence to express their outrage at
the Isiacli occupation.
I am firmU committed to non-violence
on both moral and strategic grounds, and
believe thai everyone who supports Pales
tinian rights should urge them to cease
their violence. And I believe that calling
for an end to American support for Israel
is likely to have exactly the wrong conse
quences, strengthening the paranoia of
some Jews who still believe that the whole
world is against us.
Rather, we need a policy that exhibits
compassion both lot Israel and the Pales
tinian people — and that sense of balance
and compassion is exactly what was miss
ing from the ad which quoted me out of
context.

Demand more from your pro-choice
candidates!
In yesterday's lettei to The Daily, Stan
ford Students for Choice encouraged
Stanford to vote for candidates that sup
port the "pro-choice" movement, hoping
these candidates will make abortion "safe,

legal and accessible." Bui isn'i ii time to de
mand more from pro-choice candidates
than a politically correct catch-phrase?
When a pro-choice candidate demands
a woman's right to choose, she should
light fora woman's right to make an in
formed decision, one that is best tor all
concerned. She should fight for objective
counseling for those facing unplanned
pregnancies, counseling that presents all
the options, so that their choice clearly fits
their situation. She should not suppress
information about abortion alternatives
fearing th.it she will lose the support of
pro-choice voters.
When a pro-choice candidate advo
cates that women should have a choice, he
should contribute to the development of
programs ih.it help poverty-stricken par
ents with children. I fe should demand aid
for these parents ac toss the country, in the
form of training, money and services, so
that women lacing an unplanned preg
nancy do not feel like their onlv solution is
to abort their children. I fe should light for
minorities, teenagers and college students
who are more likely to choose abortion
due to economic hardship. I fe should not
simply c laim that the legal right to choose
gives women all the options they need
when the issue is clearly more complex, es
pecially for the poor.
When a pro-choice candidate dec lares
that abortion should be safe, she should
demand that abortionists provide women
with the exact details of the procedure.
She should require abortionists to explain
abortion's risks to women. She should re
quire abortion clinics to keep accurate
records and to notify hospitals when com
plications occur. She should light lor re
quired loll* >w-up visits in case of post-abor
tion problems. She should not be curious
ly silent about a woman's right to sale med
ical (are when pressured bv pro-choice
groups and abortionists.
When a pro-choice candidate savs he
wants abortion to be a rare decision, he
should light lor educational programs to
prevent unwanted pregnancies. He
should light lor programs that both help
women support their children and assist

women in their decision to pursue adop
tion. I le should demand that existing pro
grams clearly present all options to help a
woman in making her final decision so
that abortion doesn't become the "obvi
ous" choice. A pro-choice candidate
should not neglect what he preaches, be
cause he thinks that true action toward
making abortion rare would result in
lewer votes during election time.
When a pro-choice candidate claims
that lile begins at birth, she should de
mand that doctors give the best possible
care lor children born alive during unsuc
cessful abortions. She should light lor the
prosecution of doctors and clinics that
leave live babies exposed lor hours on a
counter until the) finally die. A pro-choice
candidate should not avoid this issue en
tirely, considering that lighting lor a child
who has been born alive would hurt her

stance on abortion and alienate her from
pro-choice supporters.
When a pro-choice candidate advo
cates the right ol women to choose abor
tion, he should strive to help women who
have chosen abortions, lie should light
lot counseling and medical < are lor
women suffering from Post Abortion
Syndrome. He should not discard these
women who actualb exercised their legal
right to choose an abortion and are now
dealing with the consequences ol it. lie
should not ignore them, thinking tliev
are harmful to his position as a pro
choice advocate.
Abortion is more than a theoretic al de
bate. and it is not enough lor candidates to
claim that the) bold a certain position on
the issue. Stanford Students for Lile rec
ognizes that there is more to the pro-lile
movement than the question of whether

abortion should be legal. We are motivat
ed In our concern lor women, children
and families and we hope that those on the
opposing side hold the same motivations.
We hope that pio-c hoicers demand
that their candidates activel) light to pro
vide women with the objective, careful
choice that is theirs by law despite the
pressure from a billion-dollar industry
and the desire to further a political career.
We hope that .ill voters toda\ support ac
tions, not just words, to help women, chil
dren and families.
