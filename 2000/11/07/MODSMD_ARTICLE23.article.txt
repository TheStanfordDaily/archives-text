# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## All you selfish, superficial Stanford chauvenists, quit complaining 
### MARK SILVER STAFF GUEST COLUMNIST 
Once upon a time, I had a
mantra, an axiom that I swore
by to .ill who were bored
enough to listen to me. Ii gave
me great coiniort, satisfaction and peace of
mind whenever I was feeling down. My
mantra went something like this:
Stanford girls suck.
\\ hy did I adhere so strongly to this be
lief.-' Was it because I had such .1 penetrat
ing, perceptive understanding of the
women on our campus? Nope. The real
answer was infinitely more banal: 1
couldn't gel laid.
For some reason, even though 112 was
overweight, insecure, bitter, moderately
depressed and generally suffering 112 rom a
crisis of low self-esteem, all qualities whu Ii
most women find incredibly attractive, I
just couldn't find any female who would
show the slightest interest in me. So, with
impeccable logic, 1 reasoned that the fault
must lie with the women here at the Farm.
Well, guess what? Now that I've made a
little progress in mv own weaknesses, I've

realized something. Stanford girls don't
suck, lu lad, I happen to like a fair num
ber of them. And now I have a new
mantra, one that sounds equally obnox
ious and ovei-generalized, except that I
have a sneaking suspic ion that it might be
frightfully dose to the truth. This is it:
Stanford guys suck.
What basis do I have for believing this?
Well, let's look at how we males, for the
most part, treat and think about women
on this campus.
We whine about how there are barely
any hot girls at Stanford — one guy's
quantitative assessment was about six per
cent — when our serious standards of
beauty go no further than makeup, tight
and revealing c lothing and body lai per
centage. Then we shake our heads in dis
belief at all the "anorexic girls who work
out three hours a clay at 1 residder."
We pour alcohol down their throats to
make them more willing to fall into our
beds, fearful ol actualh using some charm
or personality to make us sexually appeal
ing. Fearful, rather, that they would dis
cover that we have none of either.
We moan about the loud and annoying

girls in our classes, the ones who always
talk so much, unaware of our own inabili
ty to actually listen to what our female
classmates are saying, unless they're really
hot.
We reward our girlfriends' affections
by insulting them and putting them down
in front of other people and generally
treat them like live-year-olds. Hey, how
else are we supposed to maintain control
over them?
We make them expend enormous
amounts of energy attempting to figure
out what's bothering us, and then we will
only agree lobe pleasant il thev provide us
with orgasms.
We identify with "men are the victims of
demasculinization" movies like "Fight
Club," as if these films make some sort of
profound statement on the modern male
condition. It doesn't occur to us to take re
sponsibility for our own shortcomings and
sources of unhappiness.
We make women tailor their conversa
tions with us to whatever we're interested
in discussing. Otherwise we mi in silence,
eyes gla/ed over, smiling and nodding, as
we pretend to pay attention to whatever il

is they're babbling about.
We expect our significant others to be
waiting constantl) by the phone for our
tall, then don't bother to tall them lor
days. I here's thai control thing again.
We spend hours watching pornogra
phy, then wonder why wet an t help think
ing of women as srxual objects.
We dance with women at parties, then in
dignantl) dismiss them as cockteases il they
don't go home with us, because dancing ob
vious!) implies booking us.
We only read male authors and listen to
male musicians, because what they're talk
ing about is universal, while women artists
only deal with female issues.
We believe that our unhapp) moods
are due to genuine mental or emotional
suffering rather than just some pre-men
strual hormonal flux.
We make sexisi comments constantly
and unconsciously.
Okay, enough. I'm sure there are a
number of guys out there, maybe even a
large number, who are shaking their
heads and saying, "What is he talking
about? I'hal's not me. For those of you
who honest 1) can say you don't practice

am of Ihe behaviors listed above, I salute
you.
As for the rest of us jerks (and you know
if you're one of us), what should we do?
We could just say men and women are
fundamentally different, with varying bio
logical needs and mental perceptions of
the world. While that's probably true,
being different does not give us the right
to be assholes.
So what's the answer? Maybe we could
start treating women .is interesting and in
tefligent human beings who have equally
\.ilid ideas, beliefs and opinions instead of
treating them merely as objects for our
own sexual or ego gratification. 1 wake up
every day and try to transform my mind
set and behavior in this way — and even'
day I fail, sometimes by a little, more often
by a lot.
But I'll keep trying. Any of you assholes
( are to join me?

and unconsciously.
Okay, enough. I'm sure there are a
number of guys out there, maybe even a
large number, who are shaking their
heads and saying, "What is he talking
about? I'hal's not me. For those of you
who honest 1) can say you don't practice

am of Ihe behaviors listed above, I salute
you.
As for the rest of us jerks (and you know
if you're one of us), what should we do?
We could just say men and women are
fundamentally different, with varying bio
logical needs and mental perceptions of
the world. While that's probably true,
being different does not give us the right
to be assholes.
So what's the answer? Maybe we could
start treating women .is interesting and in
tefligent human beings who have equally
\.ilid ideas, beliefs and opinions instead of
treating them merely as objects for our
own sexual or ego gratification. 1 wake up
every day and try to transform my mind
set and behavior in this way — and even'
day I fail, sometimes by a little, more often
by a lot.
But I'll keep trying. Any of you assholes
( are to join me?
