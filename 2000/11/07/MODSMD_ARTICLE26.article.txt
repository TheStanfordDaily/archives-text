(II I.VI'I AN( K)(1A, I cnn. (AP) — In .111 in
\<»i 11 -I.ke gesture, (leorge W. Hush began 11 is
final < ampaign (I.in in rival Al (lore's home state
.iiul was ending 11 in Hill ('.Hilton's, predicting
victory in both.
Hush and top ad\ isers projected an air ol in
vincibility vesterdav, though polls showed the
presidential 1 ace was( lose.( Campaignollic ialsat
times seemed almost gidd\, sharing jokes with
reporters, taking photographs, even talking
about s( hools. neighborhoods and real-estate
prices in Washington.
'We're coming down the stretch. I I eel opti
misti(. I like what I feel," Hush told an airport
ralb in (Chattanooga as several thousand sup
porters ( banted "one more day"and "help is
on the way."
"Mv opponent vows to carry bis home state.

He may win Washington, D.C., but he's not
going tocai r\ I ennessee," Hush said to roars of
approval.
Hesides I ennessee and Arkansas, the
Texas governor also had stops in Wisconsin
and lowa belore returning to Texas to vote
this morning and await the election results.
Hush's final swing took him to lour states
that voted for Clinton and (lore in 1'.) ( .)2 and
1 ( .) ( .)f>. but which polls suggest could go Repub
lican today. Bush urged supporters in Clreeti
Hav, Wis., to "redouble the ellbrts to get people
out to the polls."
"Don't let up. It's a dose election," he later
told several hundred Republican volunteers in
a Davenport, lowa, theater. "We're going to
win lowa. We're going to shock them in Illinois,
too."

The Republic ans also were sending out an e
mail from lbrmei Joint Chiefs c hairman Colin
Powell, urging Hush supporters to turn out.
"We have an extraordinary opportunity 011
Nov. 7," Powell says in tlu- note." Ihe ('.old War
is over, but we need coherent and principled
leadership for .1 rapidly ( hanging world, and <1
military ready to deter war if possible and win
decisively if necessary."
In Austin, I ex.is, the biggest ollices at Hush-
Cheney campaign headquarters stood empt\
yesterday. Hush's top lieutenants had (locked to
join him fora filial and lestive road trip.
"We feel like momentum is 111 our direction.
Our ground game is the likes of which hasn't
been seen in the history ol American politics,"
said Don Evans, the campaign
chairman.
"Our people are working hard.
We have 243,000 volunteers. 1 hey
will have made 00 million phone
(.ills, wrapped 110 million pieces
of mail. That's what's really going
to make the difference coming
down the home stretch," Kvans
said.
Bush's schedule and the com
ments of his top advisers seemed
designed to transmit endgame
confidence and to establish an
aura of inevitability.
But part of the euphoria also
may have been sheer relief. Alter
i wo years of nonstop campaigning,
the disciplined, close-knit Bush
team was mindful that the race was
sliding from the control of the can
didates to the electorate.

"I feel like we've run a good
c ampaign, done all we c an do. Now
its up to the voters," said Karen
Hughes, Bush's communications
director and longtime adviser.
I he governor asked me this
morning how I felt. 1 told him I
feel serene,' site s.iid.
She said Bush told her he was
serene, too.
As Bush prepared to leave Or
lando, I'la., for his final day of
campaigning, he said, "We've
laid the groundwork lor victory.
Now it's jusi getting people to the
polls. 1 trust the people. I trust
that thev've heard our message.
And tomorrow I believe we're
going to have a good day."
I lis parents — former Presi
dent Bush and Barbara Bush —
and other l.nnih members were
ll\ing into Vusiin vesterday night
and planned to spend much of
tonight together, including a
family dinner, before attending
an election night party.
