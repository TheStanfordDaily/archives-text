### ANUJ GUPTA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Alter eight years in the House
<>l Representatives, eight years in
the Senate, and eight years as
Vice President, Al (lore will learn
toda\ whether he will spend his
next loin in the While 1 louse. In
the closest presidential election
in decades, he may have to stay
up .ill night to find out.
Gore will wind up his cam
paign this morning with pre
dawn rallies in the critical battle
ground slate ol Florida, followed
bv .1 ilight to his home state ol
Tennessee. His arrival in
Nashville will mark the end of a
3<)-hour marathon push
through five states as he sii ives to
defeat his Republican opponent,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
As final tracking polls re
vealed th.it Hush's lead had nar
rowed to one or two points, (.ore
expressed confidence about

today's outcome.
"We've made up a 15- to 20-
point gap over the past year, and
now we're going into the final 36
hours a dead-heat race, and we
dearly have the momentum,'' he
said on (IBS' "Farlv Show."
lu Ins stump speeches in lowa,
Missouri and Michigan, Gore
continued to hit on the main
(hemes of his campaign: pop
ulism and economic prosperity.
I have a passion to do what's
right lor your family," Gore told
an audience in Flint, Mich., lo
dising on issues such as health
care, campaign finance reform
and lax cuts.
"You know ii makes a differ
ence whether or n<rt you have a
president who's going to fight foi
you instead of just making it
sound good." he said iu Missouri.
Gore lot used on the strength
of the nation's economy iu hisap
pearances 011 morning network
television. "I iliink that what is in
volved in ihis race is whether or
not we are going to have polities
that keep our economic good
times rolling and extend them to
the people who've not vet shared
in those good times," he said on
NBC's "Today."
For (iore to win today, most ex
perts believe that he must carry
Florida, a state that is governed l>\
Bush's younger brother Jeb. Re
cent polls have shown the race to
be <i virtual dead heal there, with
(lore having a slight advantage.
"II we win Florida, I think we
win," Sen. loin Harkin, an lowa
Democrat and leading (iore sup
porter, told Reuters. "But it is
going to be close."
Polls have also shown (iore
with narrow margins in Pennsyl
vania and Michigan, two other
large states that advisers have
deemed potentially decisive.
"II we get Florida, Michigan
and Pennsylvania, they can't win."
said (iore adviser (ireg Simon to
Reuters. "That is what we consid
er our iron triangle."
Also remaining to be seen is
whether (iore will benefit from

last minute defectors from the
campaign of Green Party c andi
date Ralph Nader, whose third
party candidacy is endangering
Gore's prospects in key states
such as Washington, Oregon
,ind Wisconsin.
(iore said yesterday that he be
lieves Nader's impact will be mini
mal. "I think by tomorrow, panic -
ularly with the election this c lose,
most people are going to want to
participate in the main choice." he
told the Associated Press.
While (iore and his running
male, Connecticut Sen. Joseph
I.ieberman, crisscrossed the coun
try in their final drive, analysts and
scholars pondered the unusual
possibilities that the Klcctoral (.ol
lege system creates.
Some scholars have raised the
possibility of an electoral contra
diction: Bush could win the popu
lar vote, bolstered by large mar
gins in I exas, the Midwest and the
South, while (iore could reach the
threshold ol 270 electoral votes
needed to win by carrying the
large swing states with narrow
margins. It would be only the
third time in American history
that the president would have lost
the popular vote.
