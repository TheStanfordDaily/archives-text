cer team (15-1-1, ~»-1 Pacific 10
Conference) lias waited two years
for this moment.
After suffering a disappointing
loss in the final Came of the
N( A\ (championships against In
diana two years ago, Stanford has
finally avenged its loss. ()n Satur
day, !Stanford defeated Indiana 1-
0 in sudden death overtime and
stole the I foosiers' spot as the No. I
team in ilie nation.
But for the Cardinal, success is
not a matter of rankings, it's about
the team's performance.
"The rankings are not really a
big issue amongst the players,"
said senior midfielder Ryan Nel
son. "The team itself knows how
good we actually are, and we don't
need rankings to tell us where we
are at. Hut, at the same lime, it is
great lo beat the teams thai gel the
recognition."

be .i battle. In the first half alone
both teams defenses shut down the
opposing ollenses as Stanford and

Indiana took only four shots be
tween them.
In the second half, both teams
picked up the pressure and creat
ed a number of dose opportuni
ties. Stanford even had a legiti
mate chance to put the game awa\
in the (iHtli minute when sopho
more forward Roger Levesque
had a near miss from inside the
box.

the lirst minutes. With both
teams trying to finish the game oil
with a sudden-death goal, the
game could have gone either way,
but coming up huge for the (Cardi

keeper Adam Zapala.
At the ( .)7th minute Indiana
broke free behind the defense with
a two on one and could have put
the game away, but Zapala came
(tashing out to make a sliding
save, shutting down the Hoosier
attack.
I n the I (Wrd minute of play, Za
pala came up with yet another cru
cial save.
Just seconds later, senior mid
fielder Scott Leber sealed the vic
