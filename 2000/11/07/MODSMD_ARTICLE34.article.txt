### KIMBERLY ROBERTS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Its ilie type ol story von would expect to hear on
television. A ten-vear-old bov's mother comes home
one da\ with a stack of brochures and pamphlets and
tells him to choose a summer activiix. I he youngster,
not thinking 100 haul, decides 11 tat "playing with
swords" sounds like Inn, and a career is launched.
I his is exacth what happened to junior lencer
Ciraham Allen. W hen he was just 10 years old, his
mother decided that he needed to find a summer
( lass, and the lent ing brochure jusi seemed to jump
out at him.
I his simple ad look on a whole new meaning ivvo
weekends ago at the Ixmg Heai li Slate Invitational, as
Allen earned himsell the highest ranking possible l< >r a
fencer. I lis ranking c atapulted o\ei three< ategories in

Allen, who sa\ s ihat, "h» ,i long lime I've fell that I've
been able lo feme at .1 high level. I've beaten a lot of
quality lencers including some with the A ranking. At
I .oug Heat li I fought as well .is I needed lo do lo earn
the ranking and now I finally have the proof of all of
in\ hard work."
I lis A ranking will help Allen tremendously when
he attends non-collegiate tournaments.
Last season Allen tame 111 third in the western re
gional tournament. I he coaches make the final deci
sions about who will attend finals and no leam can

fencing summer t amp in high st 11001 in which he was
exposed to the fencing program and the academics ol
the school, lie quickly ( hanged his mind.
"\lv decision to come to Stanford was based on a
combination of fencing and academics," Allen said.

I felt that I could improve greatly and have a positive
impact 011 Ihe team. Of course, Iwas also drawn by

Originally from Tucson, Ariz., Allen is a physics
major and has hopes of doing high-tech optical re
search when he graduates. He is also interested in
computers and is considering attending graduate
school before venturing out into the workforce.
Currently, he works at an applied physics laborato
ry in the Laser Interferometer Gravitational ()bserva

design two large (112 km) laser lubes, which will detect
gravitational waves. The tubes will be stationed in
Washington and St. Louis and are 101 the purpose of
scieniilic research. Allen's division ol the program is
presently involved in designing a platform whose ob
jective will be to remain completely stationary despite
the natural movements of the earth.
