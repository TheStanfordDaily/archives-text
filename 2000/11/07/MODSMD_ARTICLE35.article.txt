candidate, told reporters yesterdax as his cam

hours from now, and you can make this hap
pen," he said inside an airport hangar vester

lers, who shouted, "Why don't you quit your
day job?" — a reference to his simultaneous run
to keep his Senate seat — and "No more (lore!"
"1 respect your first Amendment rights.
Now why don't you respect mine?" he said be

"Aw, come on." But he persisted: "It really is

me. I his is 1101 a recorded announcement."

morning. I love yon. Lieberman told her.
