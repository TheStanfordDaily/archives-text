Stanford ranks among the top
20 organi/aiions receiving in
come from private contribu
tions, according to a list com
piled by The Chronicle of Phil
anthropy.
Last year Stanford received
$319,590,155 from private do
nations, plating it 19th on the
list. Only three universities
ranked higher: Harvard (10),
( ornell (1 f>) and Duke (1X).
Hut Ceci Evangelista, special
assistant to the vice president for
development, said that this rank
ing is not a key gauge because a
variety of organizations — such
as the Salvation Army, the Na
ture Conservancy and Campus
Crusade for Christ International
— are included on the list, mak
ing it difficult to establish a
meaningful comparison, Evan
gelista said.
Instead, the University's De
velopment Office looks more
closely at how Stanford per
forms with respect to its peer in
stitutions such as Harvard, Cor
nell. Duke, other Ivy League
schools .ind private universities.
But Evangelista said she is
happy that Stanford is ranked in
the top 20 on this list because it
shows that the University is
"doing pretty well in the philan
thropic realm."
Stanford's listed income
through donations is what Evan
gelista calls "cash through the
door." I his figure represents
money that has already been
triven to the University, not

promised gilts. Stanford receives
its income from private donors
— including individuals, charita
ble and professional foundations
— corporations, associations and
gift-giving entities.
The biggest chunk of income
to Stanford comes from "living
individuals," according to Evan
gelista, primarily alumni,
friends and parents of current
students at the University. The
second-largest amount of money
given to Stanford comes from
foundations and associations,
followed by corporations.
Evangelista said that the pri
mary motive for private contrib
utors to give money to Stanford
is that they have a real belief in
the mission of the University
and its programs.
Evangelista cited the example
of corporations that wish to sup
port the Stanford Graduate Fel
lowships Program, an endow
ment created for graduate stu
dent support that could eventu
ally benefit the company donat
ing the money to the program. A
less important motivation for
making donations to the Univer
sity is tax relief, which is a bene
fit of giving to a non-profit orga
nization like Stanford.
Donated funds are used for
Stanford programs, student aid,
day-to-day expenses, funds,
scholarships, professorships and
endowments, among other ex
penditures. Many undergradu
ate programs such as Stanford
Introductory Studies, Freshman
/ Sophomore College and the
Honors CCollege have benefited
from this income through gifts
of private donors.
Stanford solicits donations pri
marily by direct mail and tele
phone. Evangelista stated that
the student calling program has
been "very effective" because stu
dents are best able to represent
the true Stanford experience.
