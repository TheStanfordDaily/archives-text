campaign news could ellect the
outcome: the report lasi week
thai Bush was arrested on a DUI
charge in Maine in l'.lTti. Bush
supporters say this shouldn't
make a difference when voters
step up to the polls.
"Certainly the Dl T shouldn i
have an effect on \oU is. but it >
too early to tell if it will," said ju
nior Christopher Desmond,
president emeritus of the Stan
ford Republicans. "Bush has al
ways admitted to 'youthful indis
cretions,' and as over (>() percent

ol Americans know someone
who's been slopped while over
the limit, I think they'll be able to
sympathize."

note that while Hush could lose
the election, he may still win the
popular vote, something accom
plished only twice in I '.S. history,
most recently in ISSN.

ular vote by more than live per
cent, but it remains to be seen il
he can capture enough states to
'win,' " I)esmond said.
Students said voter turnout
will be of great importance with
the election so c lose.
Hush ad\(M ales a broad tax cut

or danger lo (he mother's lilt*.
"Governor Bush has proved to
be a superior leader to the vice
president, as exemplified in
Gore's class-warfare campaign
style, and I think he would have a
better chance of working with a
sharply divided Congress,"
Desmond said.
