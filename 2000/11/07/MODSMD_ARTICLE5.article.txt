According to a recent C.NN-I SA Today
poll, six pert ent of voters are likel\ to choose
Nader, while an AB(News poll indicated that
Nader was favored In three percent of voters.
Nader will likely earn ninth of Ins snppoi I
from college students.
"I really have no idea how many students
will vote for Nader, but the likelihood is thai it
will be significantly higher than the national
average, as it was in IDUG," said Stanford
Green Party president Shat liar Link, a doc
toral student in history. "Will he gel his five
percent? It will certainlv be close."
Ilie St an lord Green Part v. which was re

born this (all alter <111 8-vear hiatus, has about
50 members who regularly attend meetings.
I lie group has 01 gani/ed two teat h-in events
during the past lew weeks.
Approximately 10 people attended a
teach-in at Columbacon Friday.
"()ur goal was to explain to interested vot
ers Nader's appeal — his integrity, his intel
ligent e and his long-standing commitment to
the protection and advancement of the rights
and interests ofcommon < ili/ens in Amei ica,"
said event organizer Martha Roberts, a junior.
"College-age people have one
of the lowest voter turnouts of am
age group," she added. "Since
Nader appeals to and targets non
voters who have given up on the
system or feel their concerns are
ignored, college campuses are
some of the hotbeds of Nader sup
port. Stanford is no exception."
One of the topics students and
community members discussed
Friday was "strategic voting."
Many students were concerned
that voting for Nader was essen
tially the same as voting for Re
publican nominee George W.
Bush. Many students said they
were torn between voting for (lore
or voting for Nader and possibly
electing the conservative Hush.
"We want to help Ralph get his
five percent, but we don't want
Bush," said one participant at Fri
day's teach-in.
Link and other Green Party
members have heard these argu
ments before.
"Personally, I'm going to vote
my consc ienc e, and I hope others
will do the same," I .ink said.
Peter Stair, a junior who
stopped out of Stanford to work in
Nader's press office, agreed.
"Anyone who wants to change

our society lor the better should
see that their vote is wasted on the
status quo, especially when it
means one less vole lor building
an honest watch-clog and progres
sive movement," he said recently.
But sophomore Mike Br/.0-zowksi
zowksi was not convinced,
"Nader seems to be popular
here because he tries to paint him
self as anti-establishment and
many students believe he will free
us from enslavement to cot pot a
tions," he said. "I he Stanford
Green Party goes so far as to in
voke Huxley and to compare
Gore and Bush to Nike and
Reebok, marginalizing their dif
ferences. I his message is danger
ously misleading."
During his visit to campus last
week, Nader criticized both presi
dential candidates as he spoke
about corporate power, racism
and poverty.
"Nader's talk last Monday left a
strong impression on most who
viewed it," Link said. "Almost
everyone I spoke with was very im
pressed with his message. I'm sure
Ralph got a few more votes over to
the Greens Monday night."
Nader is endorsed by a variety
of alternative publications, includ
ing the San Francisco Bay
Guardian.
