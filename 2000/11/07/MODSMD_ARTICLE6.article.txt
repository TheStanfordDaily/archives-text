## 
### ADAM LEVERMORE-RICH 
As election lime nears, accusations ol
underhanded politics continue to fly in the
hotly-contested race lor the fifth district
seat on the Santa Clara County Board ol
Supervisors.
Candidate Dolly Sandoval, a Foothill-
DeAn/.a Coininnnily College trustee, lias
criticized her opponent, Palo Alto Mayor
Liz Kniss, lor an advertising mailer that
relets to her as "Dolly San Jose' San
doval." Ihe fiver accuses Sandoval of
being supported bv San Jose interests "de
termined to win a voting bloc and control
the Board of Supervisors."
" I I lis is politic sat its absolute worst,"
said Sandoval.
I'he flyer, which arrived at homes last
week, was sponsored by an organization
called the Citizens lor Accountability m
Government, which touts itself as "a coali
tion of concerned Santa Clara residents
and property owners."

Kniss spokeswoman kindall Blau said
that Kniss was shocked and appalled by
the advertisement, adding that the cam
paign didn't know who sent it. "We would
never sponsor something like this," she
said.
According to paperwork filed with the
California Secretarv of State, $11,000 ol

the group's funding
comes from two groups:
Premier Parking Man
agement. Inc., and In
vestors of Forest Plaza.
Both organizations are
run by |ames Baer, a
Palo Alto developer and
Liz Kniss supporter.
Blau ac knowledged
that Baer has con-

tributed to the cam
paign but insisted that every donation lias
complied with election law. She denied
any connection between Baer and the
campaign beyond the contributions.

But litis is not the lirsi time in the cam
paign Sandoval lias feuded with James
Baer. In August, Sandoval was kicked out
of an office that Baer was leasing to the
I mted Democratic Campaign. Baer told
reporters at the time that he never lets city
or county candidates use his property be
c anse of his business. Sandoval's c ampaign
accused Kniss ol pressuring Baer to evict
Sandoval.
" That's absolutely lalsc," Blau said.
"Whatever happened between Ms. San
doval and the Democratic Party was be
tween them and had nothing to do with
us."
I he mailer controversy is the latest de
velopment m a heated race. The two c an
didates are vying for the seal on the Board
which incorporates <ill or part ol Stanford,
Palo Alto, Mountain View, Los Altos, Los
Altos I fills. (.upc nino and Saratoga.
Main assumed Kniss would win easily
in the Match primary, but Sandoval gar
nered !V1 percent of the vote while Kniss

received 12 percent, forcing a runoff.
In the past few months of campaign
ing, attention has been placed heav il\ on
the role of endorsements.
While the Kniss campaign is cjuic k to
distance themselves from the negativit\
of the mailer, they have focused on the
support Sandoval receives from promi-

nent San |ose politi
cians such as Mayor
Ron (ionzales.
In an October San
Francisco ( hroniclo ar
ticle, Kniss accused
Sandoval ol being "too
c losely lied to San |ose
interests that lend to
dominate county poli-

cy-making."
"Over the course of the last two
months, I've repealed!) had to < larifv to
Liz that I'm not from San Jose," San
doval replied. "I was born and raised in
District Five."

hi the last two weeks, Sandoval and
Kniss have both lobbed accusations of
ethics violations at each other.
Kniss went before the Santa Clara
County C ampaign Kthics Foundation
and accused the Demot rat it Sandoval ol
paying to have hcrsell addetl to a Re
publican voting guide, along with the
text "Liz Kniss is a Democratic activist
who's hosted Al Core. Don't be Iboled!"
I he supervisor's rat e is a non-parti

didates listed on the ballot.
Sandoval responded the following
