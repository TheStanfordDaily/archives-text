Falls Must-See Film!
Fhe lovable "Billy Elliot/'about an 11-year-old dancer, launches the film careers of
the amazing young actor Jamie Bell and celebrated stage director Stephen Daldry.
Already a smash in Britain, it may be the biggest sleeper since "The Full Monty.'
Billy Elliot is an 11-year-old English coal
miner's son with an unexpected gift, and passion,
for ballet. It's a name you will remember, and not
just because the movie "Billy Elliot" bears his
moniker. As played by a wonderful 13-year-old
newcomer named Jamie Bell, he may be the
most endearing prepubescent hero since the
disarming Swedish waif in "My Life as a Dog"
IS years ago. And this delightful film, with its
surprising depth charges of emotion, has the feel
of a movie that's going to lodge itself in the
public's affections fora long time to come.
lo say that "Billy Elliot" is a crowd pleaser is a
no-brainer, but it doesn't do the movie justice,
and it doesn't convey just how passionately
audiences take this small English film to heart.
In Britain, where it was No. 1 its opening
weekend, it surpassed the opening numbers for
"Four Weddings and a Funeral" and almost
equaled those for"The Full Monty"- the two
most successful British films to date. The
London critics have been raving, and even the
hippest moviegoers have been spotted dabbing
their eyes with hankies as they emerge from
Billy's excellent adventure...A movie so artfully
made, so deeply charming, so heartfelt,
it's not only pointless to resist, it's damn
near impossible. -David Ansen
