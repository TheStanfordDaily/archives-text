1956
On November 8, 1956, Hie Daily report
ed on a disturbing occurrence altei the elec
tion entitled, "SU Students I lang Stevenson
Effigy."
"Just as Adlai Stevenson began his con
cession speech at 10:1:") ruesdav night he
was hung in effigy from tree outside Stern
I lall by a small group ol students.
"The crude figure was made out of a
dirty pair ol khaki pants and <i I -sin with a
paper hag fora head and card boat <1 lubes
for arms, li carred the inscription, "Adlai
Takes (ias." "
Bottom line: From presidential hopeful to being
hung in effigy outside Stern Hall. The fall from
glory to shame can be brutal and quick, as
proven by Adlai Stevenson 44 years ago.
