						Stanford Daily Don't let your motivation end with the vote

THE VOTES ARE ill, the cam
paigning is over, and all the
work is done. Right? Wrong.
Election Day may be past, but
t he real choices are just beginning.
The newly minted officeholders have yet
to cast a vote, they have vet to issue an order,
they have yet to allocate a dollar. Election
Day is not the end of political activity; it is
just the beginning.
The campus was abuzz with voter reg
istration drives, issue forums and candi
date debates leading up to yesterday's
election.
But political activity at Stanford tradi
tionally quiets to a whisper by mid-Novem

candidates, and urge others to do the same,
they go back to their books, their games and
their diversions.
The change is understandable. After all,
campaigns have personalities, they have
slogans, they have all the excitement of a
race. Post-election governing, on the other
hand, is slow, quiet and complicated.
But it is in the calm after the storm that
real changes get made. No matter who gets
elected in November, nothing alters until
after the swearing-in in January. Politi
cians need most to hear from their con
stituents when they are passing laws and
making decisions, but it is then that the
voices are quietest.
Remember, too, that much of the ac

tivism students have engaged in has not
been about the candidates themselves, but
rather about the issues that they represent.
Those issues are no less important and no
more resolved now that new elected offi
cials are in office.
In fact, now is the time when voters need
to be most vocal, reminding the elected of
ficials of the business at hand — namely,
fulfilling the promises upon which they
were elected.
We commend campus groups and indi
viduals who engaged themselves in the po
litical process this month. Don't stop now.
Don't think the race is over because your
candidate won or lost. Be the steady voice in
the long term, not just the impassioned cry

in the election furor.
After all, losing candidates can make
large impacts. In 1992, Ross Perot was re
sponsible for making the balanced budget a
priority for both the Democrats and the
Republicans.
The Green Party, especially, should look
on yesterday's vote as only a first step. They
energized the country and the campus, and
can build on that energy in the coming year.
Many of those who chose not to vote Green
were still greatly influenced by the promi
nence of Green Party politics and rallying,
particularly on college campuses.
Let's hope the fervor carries past tomor
row's Florida recount. Prove that the elec
tion is about policy, not politics.
