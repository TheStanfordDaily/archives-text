# LOVE IN THE TIME OF COSMO
## Life's unwinnable fight 
### 
When words lose their mean
ing, Confucius wrote, people
lose their liberty. Long ago,
the words that He at the heart
of the contemporary abortion debate lost
their meaning, and, as a result, a genera
tion of unborn lives has been lost.
Pro-abortion sounds too startling; we
prefer pro-choice instead. The clump of
cells inside a woman's uterus do not form
a "baby," as my two year-old nephew
would have it, but a "fetus," the old men
011 the courts reassure us.

I often wonder what
would happen were
our country to contin
ue clipping along the
freeway of convenience
until it finally caught
up with Princeton's
resident bio-ethicist
Peter Singer and al
lowed, as he proposes,

the killing of infants up to a certain age.
How would we take the sting out of in
fanticide? No doubt it would happen; in
fanticide would disappear into the bowels
of the Oxford English Dictionary, never
to be heard from again, replaced by a new
term that would ring in everyone's ears,
straight from the mouths of the chatter
ing classes . . . "retroactive fertility
control."
For all its gold medals in lexicon-bend
ing, the pro-choice movement cannot
alter a basic reality — abortion ends a life.
In defense of their position, many
abortion advocates claim that the letus is
not fully human and, therefore, not fully
deserving of basic human rights.
Yet, from the earliest moments of its
existence, a fetus possesses its own unique
genetic make-up. By the end of the first
trimester, its heart beats, its brain sends
waves, its organs function. However
morally repugnant his suggestions are,
Professor Singer fingers a stark contradic
tion in the pro-choice mentality. If a 24-
week-old fetus has no right to live, why
should society protet t the lile of a prema
ture baby, born 24 weeks after its
conception?
If human rights are rationally verifi
able, then they do not change with geog
raphy. No great leap in logic is needed to
see that the same confused mindset cur
rently ascendant was at work a century
and a half ago, when the birn f/ensent main
tained tfiat an African American was a
person only if he crossed a certain state's
borders.
Abortion supporters, even those who
a< knowledge the biological reality of tin

born lile, counter that a woman's right to
control her body supersedes the fetus's
right to develop.
Rut if a woman's bodv is hers alone,
why are we outraged when a pregnant
women harms her fetus by smoking,
drinking or taking drugs? The American
Medical Association has called fetal alco
hol syndrome "the leading cause of men
tal retardation in the western world," yet
abortion advocates are wary of protecting
unborn health in such cases, seeing it as
the first step in the erosion of abortion
rights.
One might argue that a society should
be concerned with healthy unborn chil
dren, but still allow the mother to abort at
any time. Still a contradiction persists: a
society that is concerned (rightfully) if a
child is born a pound too small, yet indif
ferent (wrongly) if the child is not born at
all.
Our country rests on top of a sharp
precipice, winds pushing from both sides.
This summer, the Supreme Court over
turned Nebraska's ban on partial-birth
abortion, a procedure in which a late
term fetus is partly delivered, then abort
ed by having its skull crushed. With the
high court's okay now secured, we're but
a step away from Professor Singer and
full-birth abortions.
But what if the wind had blown the
other way?
It would have meant, as abortion
rights proponents know, that legislators
would have had a hard look at the arbi
trariness of our justice. If a late-term
fetus suddenly had the right to life, how
could we deny a less-developed fetus the
same right?
It would have meant that America
would have caught, even if fora moment,
the profound message that any life has in
its eyes the potential for all life, that to de
prive anyone of the right to exist is to de
prive everyone of the right to exist.
I would feel worse about this column
appearing the day after Election Day if I
honestly thought one election was all this
country needed. But America has a long
road ahead. As it discards the unborn, our
culture of convenience forgets the disad
vantaged, shuns the elderly and executes
record numbers of criminals at home,
while stepping over countless innocents
abroad.
The fight for life has always been an
unwinnable fight. And that just makes it
all the more worth fighting.
