University Dining puts diversity at
a disadvantage
1 would like to get you thinking about
diversity on our campus and what making
a commitment to diversity means.
To analogize, I think back to something
Vice Provost Montoya once told me about
having a commitment to Division I Athlet
ics: that if we are going to have Division I
Athletics at Stanford, we are going to have
athletic scholarships.
Vice Provost Montoya was trying to
show me that there is a difference between
saying we are committed to something and
making that something actually possible.
If we are going to have a campus that is
truly diverse — diverse in religious back
grounds, lifestyles and moral preferences
— we cannot make living "differently" fi
nancially a setback or otherwise extremely
difficult.
But if you are a Kosher Jew or. like me,
lactose-intolerant and Hindu and vegetar
ian, you might end up spending thou
sands of extra dollars just to keep your eat
ing traditions.
I live at the Suites, where the meals are
fabulous — if you eat meat. The manager
of the eating club here, when I told him
about the kinds of foods I can eat, came
right out and said, "You'd be better off eat
ing somewhere else." But I still have to pay
the eating club $450 this quarter.

I discovered that this is common prac
tice on campus. At the University dining
halls, ai Row houses, here at the Suites, if
you have needs different from those of a
mainstream student, you end up having to
pay hundreds of dollars every quarter to
not participate in the assigned board plan.
My drawmate, a strict Kosher Jewish
woman, will have paid $3,850 by the time
she graduates just to be who she is. Keep
in mind that she cannot even eat the vege
tarian cooked food at a kitchen that is not
Kosher.
To me, this looks like a discrepancy be
tween being committed to diversity and
making it actually possible. If the Universi
ty were truly committed to diversity on
campus, then its institutions would not levy
financial penalties on those of us whose cul
tural lifestyles are not mainstream.
I would like to abolish this practice of
penalizing minorities. I would like to see
our campus free of institutional discrimi
nation — this built-in discrimination that
cannot be pinned on an individual.
If you agree with me, please send a
message to Jane Camarillo, the Director of
Residential Education. Her e-mail address
is janec(astanford.edu and her telephone
number is 5-2800 from an on-campus
phone. She and I are discussing the possi
bilities for correcting this mistake.

Correction to Michael Lerner's letter
Yesterday, in a letter to The Daily
("MSAN ad misrepresented quote"),
Rabbi Michael Let ner erroneously quoted
a Nov. 6 MSAN ad as concluding with
"America should not support Israel." The
ad does not include such a statement. Re
gardless, 1 appreciate his fresh take on the
current crisis as well as his concern over
being quoted out of context.
