# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Nader's Green Party is socialism dressed in new clothes 
### JOHN GIBBS GUEST COLUMNIST 
Rilph Nader and die (ireen Party
have been heralded .ts a fresh new
alternative to die ever-similar
Democrats and Republicans.
However, (ireen Part) ideals are neither
new or fresh, l»in little more than a " ( .)()s ver
sion ol Marxism.
According to Ralph Nader and the
(ireens. realit\ is nothing hut a struggle be
tween the people and "corporations." C or
por.it ions and holders ol wealth are the pri
nian evil, as the\ attempt to subvert the
democratic proc ess, while "the people" act
ing as civic servants, sin h as environmen
talists. civil tights activists and feminists,
light lor social justice and .ill things good
and tight.
It is important lor people to realize the
impoi tant parallels between the(ireen phi
losophx and its philosophical predecessor,
Marxism. I he "people vs. corporations"
paradigm should sound ccrih familiar to
those who have studied the philosophv ol
Marx, both pit realitvasa struggle between
the common man and the bourgeoisie,
both propose government management as
a solution and assume that government

possesses the wisdom to tell people how
they should live. In the end, both ultimate
ly show a grave misunderstanding of both
economic sand human nature.
(onsider the disastrous eflects Marxism
has wreaked in the 20th century. It has
caused the wholesale slaughter ol millions
under Stalin, the systematic starvation ol
countless millions in China under a state
controlled agricultural system, the repres
sion of the most basic religious rights in the
People's Republic and the complete de
struction of economic progress and cjualitx
ol life through excessive government regu
lation and control of national economies. It
is clear th.it Socialism, or the broader idea
that it is the role of the government to man
age as mam parts of a society as possible, is
a path that should not be pursued.
We should always be caretiilh watching
to make sure we are not slowly drifting
down that path. Full-Hedged socialism
would never sell in Americ a: people right
fully understand that it is evil and would re
ject it outright. However, the (ireen Part\
pushes the envelope as lar as possible, ol
lering people socialism dressed up in a new
package to appeal to a ( J()s (ves, this is si ill
the ,( .)()s) audience.
I lie following are some ke\ elements ol

die Green Part) platform and give ample
evidence that the Cireen Party is Socialist in
nature:
Maximum income: lluild into the pro
gressive iiuonu-lax a 100 percent tax on all
income over ten times the minimum
wage(s 12.50).
Federal chartering of interstate
corporations.
Periodic review of corporate charters: A
public corporate charter review process for
each corporation above $20 million in as
sets ever\ 20 years to see il it is serving the
public interest according to social and eco
logical as well as financial criteria.
Democratic conversion of big business:
Mandator)' break-up and conversion to
democratic worker, consumer and / or
public ownership on a human scale of the
largest .">OO I .S. industrial and commercial
corporations that account lc>r about 10 per
cent of employees, .">0 percent ol profits, 70
percent of sales and 00 percent of manufac
turing assets.
One of the (ireen Party's "len Key Val
ues is "K( ologic al Wisdom," which in prac -
tice translates into volumes of restrictive
new environmental regulations and red
tape which would force consumers and
businesses to adopt costly, inefficient tech

nologies which some government bureau
crat deems to lx- "environmentally safe."
These proposals include nearly all of the
classical Marxist traits: redistribution of
wealth, nationalization and / or penaliza
tion of large businesses and government
oversight of most parts of the economy, so it
is difficult to argue that the Cireen Party
does not have a Marxist foundation.
What is difficult, however, is explaining
why anyone would support such ideas in
this day and age, given their utter and com
plete failure on the world stage throughout
this century. Ihe economic implications
are disturbing enough: nationalizing the
top 500 companies, the top 200 banks and
forcing all others to pay a steep minimum
wage while observing ultra-expensive, dra
conian environmental mandates would be
a stab in the stomach lor our economic
health, without even considering the ethical
considerations.
What right does the government have to
tell any individual or organization how to
operate? In a free society each man oper
ates according to his own philosophy, not
according to how the government tells him
to operate. With Greens in office, the gov
ernment will be dictating everything down
to the very t vpe of toilet paper or staples vou

could l)ii\.
I'heit■ lias never Ir-cii a su<'cessfiil, com
peiiiive. nationalized econoim. Wealth has
nevei lx*en (reated on a large scale in na
tions with mandator) income laws, or
where people are penalized loi accumulat
ing wealth. The wealth and prosperity of
the United States was not created In a state
controlled economy, in which successful
businesses were penalized and national
ized, but In a free market ruled onl\ l>\
what people wish to purchase.
I hese I acts clearh show that the Green
Party's ideas are not onl\ moral!\ wrong,
but economical disastrous. I he histon ol
state-controlled economies and Marxist
countries reinforces this truth.
Main people voted Green because the\
were understandabh tired ol the two major
parties. Many of them probabh did not
read the Green Patty platform and learn
about its appalling plans lot controlling our
future. But however tired one may be. Not
ing lor Marxism cannot be justified. People
must understand the true foundation oi the
Green Partv soiltai America doesn't end up
choosing socialism out of apatln.

lation and control of national economies. It
is clear th.it Socialism, or the broader idea
that it is the role of the government to man
age as mam parts of a society as possible, is
a path that should not be pursued.
We should always be caretiilh watching
to make sure we are not slowly drifting
down that path. Full-Hedged socialism
would never sell in Americ a: people right
fully understand that it is evil and would re
ject it outright. However, the (ireen Part\
pushes the envelope as lar as possible, ol
lering people socialism dressed up in a new
package to appeal to a ( J()s (ves, this is si ill
the ,( .)()s) audience.
I lie following are some ke\ elements ol

die Green Part) platform and give ample
evidence that the Cireen Party is Socialist in
nature:
Maximum income: lluild into the pro
gressive iiuonu-lax a 100 percent tax on all
income over ten times the minimum
wage(s 12.50).
Federal chartering of interstate
corporations.
Periodic review of corporate charters: A
public corporate charter review process for
each corporation above $20 million in as
sets ever\ 20 years to see il it is serving the
public interest according to social and eco
logical as well as financial criteria.
Democratic conversion of big business:
Mandator)' break-up and conversion to
democratic worker, consumer and / or
public ownership on a human scale of the
largest .">OO I .S. industrial and commercial
corporations that account lc>r about 10 per
cent of employees, .">0 percent ol profits, 70
percent of sales and 00 percent of manufac
turing assets.
One of the (ireen Party's "len Key Val
ues is "K( ologic al Wisdom," which in prac -
tice translates into volumes of restrictive
new environmental regulations and red
tape which would force consumers and
businesses to adopt costly, inefficient tech

nologies which some government bureau
crat deems to lx- "environmentally safe."
These proposals include nearly all of the
classical Marxist traits: redistribution of
wealth, nationalization and / or penaliza
tion of large businesses and government
oversight of most parts of the economy, so it
is difficult to argue that the Cireen Party
does not have a Marxist foundation.
What is difficult, however, is explaining
why anyone would support such ideas in
this day and age, given their utter and com
plete failure on the world stage throughout
this century. Ihe economic implications
are disturbing enough: nationalizing the
top 500 companies, the top 200 banks and
forcing all others to pay a steep minimum
wage while observing ultra-expensive, dra
conian environmental mandates would be
a stab in the stomach lor our economic
health, without even considering the ethical
considerations.
What right does the government have to
tell any individual or organization how to
operate? In a free society each man oper
ates according to his own philosophy, not
according to how the government tells him
to operate. With Greens in office, the gov
ernment will be dictating everything down
to the very t vpe of toilet paper or staples vou

could l)ii\.
I'heit■ lias never Ir-cii a su<'cessfiil, com
peiiiive. nationalized econoim. Wealth has
nevei lx*en (reated on a large scale in na
tions with mandator) income laws, or
where people are penalized loi accumulat
ing wealth. The wealth and prosperity of
the United States was not created In a state
controlled economy, in which successful
businesses were penalized and national
ized, but In a free market ruled onl\ l>\
what people wish to purchase.
I hese I acts clearh show that the Green
Party's ideas are not onl\ moral!\ wrong,
but economical disastrous. I he histon ol
state-controlled economies and Marxist
countries reinforces this truth.
Main people voted Green because the\
were understandabh tired ol the two major
parties. Many of them probabh did not
read the Green Patty platform and learn
about its appalling plans lot controlling our
future. But however tired one may be. Not
ing lor Marxism cannot be justified. People
must understand the true foundation oi the
Green Partv soiltai America doesn't end up
choosing socialism out of apatln.
