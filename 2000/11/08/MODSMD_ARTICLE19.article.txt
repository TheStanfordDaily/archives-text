I'artving lo I lie* Mines ol "Who Let the Dogs
Out," supporters ol (lalilbrnian Democrat
Mike Honda gathered at his campaign head
quarters to celebrate his victory over Republi
can |im Cunneen lor the 15th District seat in
the U.S. 1 louse ol Representatives.
" I Itese are the only words I can think of.
Thank y0u...," Honda said. "We created a
campaign Irom labor, grass roots; this cam
paign was reallv ,it the grass roots level. All ol us
campaigned with our heart and soul."
both (lunnccn and I londa campaigned on
a moderate platlbrm. both proclaimed them
selves to be pro-choice, pro-environment and
pro-gun control. However, Cunneen believes
in partialb privatizing Social Security, which
I londa opposes.
1 he race has been tight and contentious,
with both sides accusing each other ol dirty
campaign tac tics. Ihe National Republican
Congressional Committee came out with an
ad titled "Mike Honda's Criminal Record"
with <i photo ol Honda that resembled ola
mug shot.

Cunneen has disavowed the ad, s.iving bis
c ampaign was not directly responsible lor it.
Honda came out with television commer
cials saying Cunneen will be .in allv ol the Na
tional Rille Association and the anti-abortion
lobby.
But Cunneen's campaign manager, Terry
Miller, said that Cunneen is in fact pro-choice
and pro-gun control.
He added, "There's even a pro-lile group
who is encouraging voters to vote lor a write-in
c andidate instead ol (lunncen."
Senior krista Claser, c hair of the Stanford
1 )ciu(»( rats, disagreed.
" The point about (lunncen is that lie's a Re
publican," she said. "II he |was] elected, we
[would] have had a Republican Congress. A
woman's right to choose is in peril."
Ann Chen, a senior at Lynbrook High
School in San |ose, said at the vic tory party that
it was.i positive sign that with Honda's win,
there will likely be six Asian-American mem
bers of (longress.
"I his is very important because there's an
increasing amouniol Asian Americans in the
bay Area, so we need more voice in govern
ment," she s.iid.

I londa was also aware ol his possible role in
Washington as an Asian-American.
"Being Asian-American, it's my desire to
stand np to speak when we're scapegoated,"
Honda said, citing the case of unclear s< ient ist
Wen Ho Lee. Lee was detained and accused
ol espionage and leaking the nation's nuclear
secrets. I le agreed to a pica bargain in which
he admitted to one relatively minor charge.
When asked to relied on his own personal
growth during this campaign. I londa staled, "I
got a deeper appreciation and respect lor indi
viduals' ability to understand the political
process."
I le added that even common people are lull
of talent and capable of making a dillerenc e.
Mike Mongan, a senior, was at I londa's cel
ebration. He had been working on Honda's
campaign since April and interned .it I londa's
ollice this summer.
l ie said that much ol the campaign work,
