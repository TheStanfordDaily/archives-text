WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans retained
their hold on the Senate lor two more yeai s vesterda\
though by a narrower margin, as I )emo( rats boasted
history-making triumphs by first lady Hillary Rod
ham Clinton in New York and a dead governor in
Missouri.
Remarkably, joining Mis. Clinton in the Senate
winners' circle was |ean (ainahan, widow of Missom i
Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan, killed three weeks
ago in a plane crash. In perhaps Kle< tion Dav's most
poignant drama, he outpolled GO!' Sen. John
Ashcrof t anyway, and she has s.iid she will ,i< cept I he
new governor's appointment to the job.
"We remain heirs of a legacy, heirs of a dream,"
Mrs. ('.arnahan, <>(>, told her followers."()n this night,
I pledge to you, rather, let's pledge to each oilier,
never let the lire go out."
Noone had ever posthumously won ele< lion lollie
Senate, though voters on ,n least three o< (asions sent
deceased candidates to the I louse. Some Republic ans
have said they might ( hallenge the (iat Italian virion ,
asserting that the late governor was no longer a slate
resident.
But for now, the Carnahan win assured I )em<x i .its

ill least 17 scats - more than enough to use the minor
ity's power to wreak havoc with the C( )l*'s legislative
agenda by forcing procedural delays.
I )emo< ratic power was enhanced tonight without
question. Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-
S.D., said in an interview.
I lie Senate is never easy," conceded Senate Ma
jority Leader I rent Loll, R-Miss,, who easily won re
eled ion himself.
I he three remaining races in Nebraska, Michigan
,ind Washington state were all 100 close to ( all.
I hough I lie (.or majority will be no better than
,).i-17 - compared lo this year's 54-40 margin - a vic
tory by two-term incumbent COP Conrad Burns in
Montana ensured that Republicans would have at
least ">() ol the Senate's 100 seats.
I hat is enough lor them to control the chamber,
no matter il Republican Ceorge VV. Hush or Dcmoc
raiK \ ice President Al (»ore was elected president.
A (lore victor)' would elevate his running mate,
(-onnc( ti( lit Sen. Joseph 1 -icberman, to the vice pres
idency, opening the door lor (i( )P Connecticut Co v.
John Rowland lo name a Republican to replace him
in the Senate.
