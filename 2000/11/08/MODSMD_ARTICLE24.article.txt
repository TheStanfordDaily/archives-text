## 
### SETH STEPHENS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A week and a halt'ago, attendees
of the football game against Wash
ington saw a wet field, an improba
ble comeback and a last-second,
game-winning drive. They did not
see <t stadium loaded with adver
tisements.
Stanford has implemented its
plan to diminish corporate influ
ent c on collegiate athletics, and, so
far, t lit- plan has been a success, ac
cording to University President
John llennessy and Athletics Di
rector Ted Leland.
Though former University
President Gerhard Casper said
that the Department of Athletics
would have "a very, very hard time
meeting its budget," llennessy
said finances have not been a
major problem, and Stanford has
not had to ( ut back on its athletics
at all.
Four years ago, Casper indicat
ed to the Athletics Department that
he was concerned with commer
cialization of Stanford athletics. In
what Leland called a "joint deci
sion" between the President's Of
fice and the Athletics Department,
the University decided to phase
out commercial .ids in all the ath
letic facilities.
"We had some concerns that
trends were pointed in the wrong
direction," 1 lennessy said.
Stanford is hoping to remove all
corporate signs this year. 1 he I ni
versitv began removing advertise

ments during the renovation of
Sunken Diamond four years ago.
I hree years ago, advertisements
were removed from Stanford Sta
dium. Finally this year, signs were
taken oil the scoreboard ol the
tool ball stadium and out ol Maples
Pavilion. There have also been cut
backs in advertisements at many
other facilities.
"We wanted t< > rem< >ve I he < >ver
whelming feeling of advertising,
particularly acute in Maples Pavil
ion," I lennessy said. "Stanlord ath
letics is independent of advertis
ing."
However, there are still ads at
some Stanford athletic fatilities. At
Stanford Stadium, for example,
there are advertisements visible on
the jumbotron and spoken over
the public address system, llen
nessy said it would be impossible to
get 1 id ol all corporate involvement
in Stanford athletics.
I he money the Athletics De
partment once received from ads
now comes mostK from donations,
both alumni and corporations
have increased their donations to
the Athletics Department, llen
nessy said there were "enough
alumni who believed that further
commercialization of college ath
letics was not good lor Stanford or
the student-athletes."
Kven though the Universit\ is
not receiving physical advertise
ments m the athletic facilities, cor
porations are giving more money
to Stanford athletics, llennessy
said that main companies who

continue i<> sponsor Stanford have
been "nuclei standing" of the situa
tion.
Initially, there were some com
plaints from corporations. Hut,
contracts have been reworked to
"keep everybody happy." accord
ing to I.eland. Stanford still gives
corporations tickets to basketball
games and advertisements in the
basketball program.
"There has not been a notice
able < hange in money," 1 lenness\
said.
Leland disagreed. He said the
Athletics Department is definitely
receiving less money than it would
have with advertisements, but ii is
very difficult to calculate the differ
ence.
"Our endowment has grown,"
he said. "I can't really put a finger
on how much money we lost."
I lie Athletic s Department's fi
nances have grown over the last
live years. Therefore, it is tough to
tell how much more it would have
earned with advertisements. Le
land estimates that the Athletics
Department received about lialf-a
million dollars less thai) they would
have had I hey kept all ads. I he de
partment has a l\ million dollar
budget this year.
B< >ili I lennessy and I .eland said
iliat the move has been very popu
lar with Stanlord fans.
"Stanford's a national leader in
main wavs," Leland said. "We fell
11 necessary i<> be a leader in athlet
ics and take a real step against com
mercialization of our program."
