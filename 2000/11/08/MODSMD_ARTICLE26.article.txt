## Running Tall 
### BETH GERMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Four-time All-American and
receni Olympian Michael Stem
ber lias already had more than a
task' of world competition. But
his vivacious appetite for adven
ture is far from satisfied. With in
terests ranging from art to cook
ing, Stember takes the definition
of" Renaissance'Man"l< > new ex
tremes.
At the Olympic Track and
Field Trials, Stember placed
third in the 1,500-meter event.
The top three American finish
ers at the July trials typically
qualified for the Sydney (lames.
But St ember's time of 3 min
utes, 37.04 seconds was .24 sec
onds short of the Olympic A
standard — the other Olympic
qualifying criteria for track ath
letes. As a result, Stember need-

Ed to run the metric mile m
3:30.80 or faster before Sept. 1 I
to compete 1 )own I nder.
Alter a 1 ailed attempt on his
home track at Stanford and two
more c lose misses in Sweden and
Switzerland, Stember finally
achieved the standard August 1S
in Monaco. His time — 3:35.11
— was a personal best .iiul the
fastest-ever 1,500-meter finish
by a Stanford runner.
"There were millions of rea
sons for me not to hit the stan
dard. But there was one reason
to hit it; I believed I could. Ii was
just a matter of sealing the deal,"
said Stember.
Even after this high achieve
ment, Stember had no lime to
let down his guard. Sydney was
staring him in the lac e. When be
spoke of competing at the


JESSICA YU, EMILY YATESDOERR/The Stanford Daily Pile
Olympic Cames, his lace lit up
witli the glow of an unforgettable
memory.
"The Olympics was one ol the
greatest experiences of m\ life.
I laving .1 < rowd of 1 12,000 people
was pretty fantastic. Ii felt likethe\
were <tll screaming lor me. I
couldn't lit-,n mysell think. Once
the gun went <>11. the cheering
never stopped.
Staying in plastic bunk beds in
the Olvmpi< Village along with
Stanford teammates Cabe Jen
nings and Brad Hauser was less
than ideal. Hut Stember concen
trated on the positives.
"I had the chance to meet amaz
ing athletes. It was interesting to
see the way the world's best ath
letes get read) for their events and
interact with teammates."
I hough Stember was disap
pointed in his performance, plat
ing among the best 15 runners in
the 1,500-meter event at Sydney,
he leels blessed to have the oppor
tunity to compete in the C «amcs.
"I realized how lucky I <im. My
whole family was there, and it was
great to be together even alter ii
was all over. Unit's what 1 11 take
with me."
As the youngest of six children,
Stember was born to a famil) ol
athletes. I le attended Jesuit High
S< hool near Sacramento, where he
ran on the school's track team and
played soccer. A natural athlete,
Stember has played soccer lor 17
years and continues i<> use it as a
( ross-irainingexercise.
Hut by junior year, he was
lorccd to < hoose a single sport. In
1995, he established scholastic su
perstat siaius In running a 1:0 1
mile as a junior. Ii was that type ol
performance that attracted Stan
lord < oa< h \'iii Lananna.
I'nder Lananna s tutelage,
Stember sei a freshman school
record lor the mile (4:02.72) and
broke the 1-niinute mark in 1998

(3:59.31). He redshirted a year
later and, alter only lour weeks ol
training, competed unattached at
the I .S. Nationals where he plac ed
fourth, just missing a berth at the
1999 World Championships.
Larlv in 2000, Stember helped
the Cardinal win the NCAA I rack
and Field (.hampionship by finish
ing fourth in the 800and second in
the 1,500. In the latter"event, Stem
ber placed runner-up to Jennings,
who would later win the 1,:>00 at
the ()lynipi< I rials.
"Michael Stember was instru
mental in our team success last
year having our best finish ever
at the [Pacific 10 Conference
Championships| and winning
the NCAAs. He was a c atalyst for
all ol the excitement that went
along with track and field. 1 m
looking loi ward to his final year
of competition here, said
Lananna.
Before each event, Stember
prepares In meditating and listen
ing to music.
"I trv to visualize the race and
think about what each competition
means."
Far Irom the track, Stember, an
American studies and studio art
major, can be lound late at the stu
dio listening to Cypsy Kings and
painting large-scale oils with his
bare hands.
"Art and sports are both active
proc esses," he said. " I he} require
intense concentration and locus."
Or perhaps he'll be down on
Casiro Street looking for quality
sushi to prepare a Japanese meal
lor his teammates. Stember likes
to bring friends and lamil\ into
the mix in the kitchen just as
much as he likes to involve the
cr<>wcl when he races.
"I love to entertain, he said.
"()n the track I want to make it
look fun and not like I'm laboring
same with cooking. 1 want peo
ple to feel with me, not leel lor me."
Along with teammates Brad

"I want to g<> lor it all, on and oil

more c lose misses in Sweden and
Switzerland, Stember finally

in Monaco. His time — 3:35.11
— was a personal best .iiul the
fastest-ever 1,500-meter finish
by a Stanford runner.
"There were millions of rea
sons for me not to hit the stan
dard. But there was one reason
to hit it; I believed I could. Ii was
just a matter of sealing the deal,"
said Stember.
Even after this high achieve
ment, Stember had no lime to
let down his guard. Sydney was
staring him in the lac e. When be
spoke of competing at the


JESSICA YU, EMILY YATESDOERR/The Stanford Daily Pile
Olympic Cames, his lace lit up
witli the glow of an unforgettable
memory.
"The Olympics was one ol the
greatest experiences of m\ life.
I laving .1 < rowd of 1 12,000 people
was pretty fantastic. Ii felt likethe\
were <tll screaming lor me. I
couldn't lit-,n mysell think. Once
the gun went <>11. the cheering
never stopped.
Staying in plastic bunk beds in
the Olvmpi< Village along with
Stanford teammates Cabe Jen
nings and Brad Hauser was less
than ideal. Hut Stember concen
trated on the positives.
"I had the chance to meet amaz
ing athletes. It was interesting to
see the way the world's best ath
letes get read) for their events and
interact with teammates."
I hough Stember was disap
pointed in his performance, plat
ing among the best 15 runners in
the 1,500-meter event at Sydney,
he leels blessed to have the oppor
tunity to compete in the C «amcs.
"I realized how lucky I <im. My
whole family was there, and it was
great to be together even alter ii
was all over. Unit's what 1 11 take
with me."
As the youngest of six children,
Stember was born to a famil) ol
athletes. I le attended Jesuit High
S< hool near Sacramento, where he
ran on the school's track team and
played soccer. A natural athlete,
Stember has played soccer lor 17
years and continues i<> use it as a
( ross-irainingexercise.
Hut by junior year, he was
lorccd to < hoose a single sport. In
1995, he established scholastic su
perstat siaius In running a 1:0 1
mile as a junior. Ii was that type ol
performance that attracted Stan
lord < oa< h \'iii Lananna.
I'nder Lananna s tutelage,
Stember sei a freshman school
record lor the mile (4:02.72) and
broke the 1-niinute mark in 1998

(3:59.31). He redshirted a year
later and, alter only lour weeks ol
training, competed unattached at
the I .S. Nationals where he plac ed
fourth, just missing a berth at the
1999 World Championships.
Larlv in 2000, Stember helped
the Cardinal win the NCAA I rack
and Field (.hampionship by finish

the 1,500. In the latter"event, Stem

who would later win the 1,:>00 at

"Michael Stember was instru
mental in our team success last
year having our best finish ever
at the [Pacific 10 Conference
Championships| and winning
the NCAAs. He was a c atalyst for
all ol the excitement that went
along with track and field. 1 m
looking loi ward to his final year
of competition here, said
Lananna.
Before each event, Stember
prepares In meditating and listen
ing to music.
"I trv to visualize the race and
think about what each competition
means."
Far Irom the track, Stember, an
American studies and studio art
major, can be lound late at the stu
dio listening to Cypsy Kings and
painting large-scale oils with his
bare hands.
"Art and sports are both active
proc esses," he said. " I he} require
intense concentration and locus."
Or perhaps he'll be down on
Casiro Street looking for quality
sushi to prepare a Japanese meal
lor his teammates. Stember likes
to bring friends and lamil\ into
the mix in the kitchen just as
much as he likes to involve the
cr<>wcl when he races.
"I love to entertain, he said.
"()n the track I want to make it
look fun and not like I'm laboring
same with cooking. 1 want peo
ple to feel with me, not leel lor me."
Along with teammates Brad
■iiul Brent Hauser, Stember hopes
to open a restaurant one da\.
"I want to g<> lor it all, on and oil
the track," he said."
