### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Road to the Final Four lias to start sometime.
Even il it's against a collection of former college
players plugging video games.
Tonight, the No. 3 Stanford men's basketball team
will take to the court in uniform for the first lime s.ncc
last March to battle the EA Sports All-Siars in an exhi
bition game at Maples Pavilion at 7;!W p.m.
Typically these exhibitions tend to lean towards
crowd-pleasing blowouts, but for coaches they can
prove valuable for settling backup spots. Last year the
Cardinal whipped Marathon ()il '.)(>-(>! and Athletes
in Action Â«)()-77 on the way to upsetting Duke in its
first official game of the season.
For head coach Mike Montgomery, the mosi im
portant thing will be to get his starters in and out
quickly without any injuries while giving his freshmen
their first taste of a big-lime college atmosphere.
Last year, then-freshman point guard Julius
Barnes made his most indelible impression of the sea
son, throwing down a memorable ofl-hand baseline
dunk in the face of an onrushing Athletes in Action
defender. Though Barnes lacked consistency during
limited playing lime last year, the team is counting on
the athleticism that Barnes showed oil on ili.it play
heading into this season.
Freshmen leyo Johnson, Matt Lottie hand Nick
Robinson will be looking to make a similar impact.

|ohnson, a (">-/, 25(i lb. forward who moonlights as
<i backup quarterback on the Cardinal football team,
is known for his athletic ism and intense hustle while
Lottie h is a f>-4 guard reknowned for outside shoot
ing and lough defense. Robinson, a (">-("> forward, is
somewhat more mysterious after coming oil a two
year Mormon mission.
Sophomore center (an lis Borchardt's status is not
mysterious, but ii is disheartening. Borchardt has al
ready been ruled out lor the exhibition, with his right
fool si ill recovering from surgery during the summer
to repair a stress frac lure.
"Ii shouldn't be .1 problem because it's not <1 bone
injury," s.iicl Montgomery. "I fe was out fora good six
months, so his leg is out of shape. I le hasn't jumped,
hasn't run. hasn't hiked, hasn't done anything.''
Also combating injury is reclshiri freshman Justin
I )avis. whe > is expected to take Mark Maclsen's spot at
power forward. D.ivis h;is had ;i sprained ankle iu ad
dition to being ill, so his practice time has suffered.
I he EA Sports All-Stars are made up of former col
lege players, most of whom gi aduaied within the past
two to three years and were unable lo stick in the NBA
or other professional leagues. I he most recognizable
names are Larry Abne\ and Bob Myers, graduates of
Fresno Slate and U(-LA, respectively.
Abney was known lor his tenacious rebounding
while playing under Jerry l arkanian with the Bull
dogs. Against Southern Methodist last February, he
pulled down a phenomenal 35 boards, the highest
single-game total in the NCAA since !%.">.
Myers, meanwhile, was a member of I CLA's HM)S
National Championship. I bought the (>-(> forward
was not one of the Bruins' premier players, his lac e
should be more than familiar to older members of the
Sixth Man (Hub.
