Expect to see a lot of Jamie
Carey in Maples Pavilion this
season.
lint don't look lot Carey in her
usual position, directing the C Cardi
nal ollense from behind the arc or
pressuring Stanford opponents in
the back court. Instead, the sopho
more star will take her place beside
head coach Tara VanDerveer and

the rest of the Cardinal stall, play
ing the leadership role from the
sidelines as the Stanford women's
basketball team heads into the pre
season — and the next three years
— without her direction on the
court.
A tearful (.are) announced that
she has been forced to end her col
legiate athletic career by a series of
concussions, the most recent of
which was suffered in an Oct. ! ( .)
practice. Supported by Van-

Derveer, (.are) told reporters that
slit- would be unable to play indef
initely, due to the risk of future
concussions and further damage
to her neuropsychological abilities.
Carey called the decision a
shock, saying, "It's hard, because
you're playing with your heart,
and you're playing with your lile,
but it was <i decision ih.it had to be
made."
fhe final decision was made b\
(la rev on Friday upon learning the

results of tests taken two days earli
er and with the advice of doctors
and the support of her coaches
and family. She told the team of
her dec ision after practice on Sat
urday.
"ft was probably one of the
hardest things I've ever done, to
statxl in front of your team and say
that you can't play anymore,"

caused by a fall in practice in which
she says her head slid into another

which include headaches, nausea,
diminished memory and cognitive
abilities and continued dizziness —
led her to seek further evaluation
from top neurologists at the Stan
lord Medical Center.
Doctors used a combination of
tests, including an MRI of Carey's
brain, to determine significant
damage and persistent concussion
symptoms that indie ate she should
no longer compete and compro
mise' her neurological health.
(larey says that she suffered her
lirst concussion iti seventh grade
and that concussions have contin
ued throughout high school and
college, culminating in the Oct. 19
concussion, in which even minor
contact caused serious and unflag
ging symptoms.
After a stellar freshman cam
paign in which she was named the
Pacific 10 Conference Freshman
of the Year, the sophomore from
Thornton, Colo., seemed to have
finally shaken a ankle in
jurs and looked poised to take her
place as the (lat dinal's floor leader.
Boasting one of the nation's top
shooting percentages from behind
the arc, Carey's magic shooting
touch, passing and ball-handling
abilities earned her a spot on the
2000-2001 Preseason All Pac-10
Team.
