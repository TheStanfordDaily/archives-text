### BECKY BLANCHARD EDITORIAL STAFF 
Expect to see a lot of Jamie
Carey in Maples Pavilion this
season.
lint don't look lot Carey in her
usual position, directing the C Cardi
nal ollense from behind the arc or
pressuring Stanford opponents in
the back court. Instead, the sopho
more star will take her place beside
head coach Tara VanDerveer and

the rest of the Cardinal stall, play
ing the leadership role from the
sidelines as the Stanford women's
basketball team heads into the pre
season — and the next three years
— without her direction on the
court.
A tearful (.are) announced that
she has been forced to end her col
legiate athletic career by a series of
concussions, the most recent of
which was suffered in an Oct. ! ( .)
practice. Supported by Van-

Derveer, (.are) told reporters that
slit- would be unable to play indef
initely, due to the risk of future
concussions and further damage
to her neuropsychological abilities.
Carey called the decision a
shock, saying, "It's hard, because
you're playing with your heart,
and you're playing with your lile,
but it was <i decision ih.it had to be
made."
fhe final decision was made b\
(la rev on Friday upon learning the

results of tests taken two days earli
er and with the advice of doctors
and the support of her coaches
and family. She told the team of
her dec ision after practice on Sat
urday.
"ft was probably one of the
hardest things I've ever done, to
statxl in front of your team and say
that you can't play anymore,"
(larey said.
After her latest concussion,
caused by a fall in practice in which
she says her head slid into another
players shin, (larcy's symptoms —
which include headaches, nausea,
diminished memory and cognitive
abilities and continued dizziness —
led her to seek further evaluation
from top neurologists at the Stan
lord Medical Center.
Doctors used a combination of
tests, including an MRI of Carey's
brain, to determine significant
damage and persistent concussion
symptoms that indie ate she should
no longer compete and compro
mise' her neurological health.
(larey says that she suffered her
lirst concussion iti seventh grade
and that concussions have contin
ued throughout high school and
college, culminating in the Oct. 19
concussion, in which even minor
contact caused serious and unflag
ging symptoms.
After a stellar freshman cam
paign in which she was named the
Pacific 10 Conference Freshman
of the Year, the sophomore from
Thornton, Colo., seemed to have
finally shaken a ankle in
jurs and looked poised to take her
place as the (lat dinal's floor leader.
Boasting one of the nation's top
shooting percentages from behind
the arc, Carey's magic shooting
touch, passing and ball-handling
abilities earned her a spot on the
2000-2001 Preseason All Pac-10
Team.
However, her accident in prac -

Care) in practices, VanDerveer
said tlicit Carey's tenacity often
made it hard lor Carey to give up
playing at her all, even il it put her
at risk.
"She loves the game ol basket
ball, .Hid slu; plays with tremen
dous passion, but I'd coach her to
take care ol herself, and 1 know
that she was working very hard ibis
fall, especially at understanding
that," VanDerveer said. I think
we're .ill reallv in shot k."
VanDerveer said the news of
Carey's situation made ibis t lie
"lowest of lows" in a coaching c a
reer thai has seen the highs of
(>l\ mpic glory and the agony of in
jured stars and missed champi
onships.
According to VanDerveer and
Carey, in the days since learning
that their teammate could no
longer join them on the court, the
rest ol the squad lias responded
with support and encouragement.
"(Carey| is just so important to
the success of our team, and [she's]
someone that von build a team
around," VanDerveer said. "On
the other hand, as soon as it be
came a reality, I think our team has
really done what von need a great
team lo do.
"They've taken it on themselves
to, first and foremost, express to
Jamie how they leel and how im
portant she is as .1 person to our
team, and that she is still ,1 part ol
our team. And the) have taken it
upon themselves to sa\. I've got lo
pick up the sla< k lor what she is not
going to be here lo do, and we
couldn't ask our team to do am
more than they 're doing."
Carey plans lo stav at Stanford
10 finish her studies and will con
tinue lo support the team, though
her future role is si ill uncertain.
However, according to Van-
Derveei. ('arev has already proven
her leadei ship and <oat hing abili
ties on the court, and. though she
will be unable lo wear her No. 1 1
jersey, she will likely help I o direct
the team from the bench.
"I love my teanunates. and
ihev're every tiling to me," Care)
said. "I just think I need to do

whatever I can to he around. give
m\ encouraging words .in<l slay in
i lit' circle, because the) re in\ lam
il\ here, and I couldn I walk away
l'roin them now. I wouldn i want
to."
1 he (Cardinal will have to adjust
to playing without ( lare\ s passion
ate plav and proven abilities at the
helm. VanDerveer expects Susan
King, a 5-fooi-7 freshman from
kit hfield, Minn., to fill the point
guard position immediately. Al
most ever\ other player, im hiding
juniors Lindsay Yamasaki and
Lauren St. (-Liir and senior Sarah
Dimson, will help t<> handle the
ball.
Without a weathered leader in
the ba< k court, Stanlord will have
tocapitali/e on its transition game,
convening last breaks into quick
baskets to minimize the pressure
on its half-court offense.
"This is a huge loss loi us in so
man) wa\s,' YanDerveer said
"But I also think its a real < lial
lenge for the 12 voung ladies that
are playing on our team. I hey rc
not conceding anything to anyone,
and they're working really hard to
accept that challenge, and I think
we'll see some great pla\ coming
out of this."
(la rev plans to be with the team
throughout the season, finding a
new place in the Cardinal pro
gram.
"Growing up, I always wanted
to plav for Stanlord. I hat's the
hardest part, is that I'll never put
on a Stanlord unilorm again and
be able to pla\ within) team on the
court again." Carey said. "But I'll
Still be there with them, and I'll go
through evervlhing with them. I
jnsi won't be physic ally pla\ ing.
I still have all the dreams that I
wanted ai Stanford. I siill want to
win a national championship. I
want to win it with them. I want to
win it with this team. I still want to
win the I'ac-10. All those dreams
don't change. It's just that now I
have to go about ii in a different
way, with a dillcrent mindset."
With that, a c hokecl-up Jamie
Carey, the plaver that a year ago
dazzled fans in her debut perfor
mance at Maples I'avilion, put her
jersey away. But, her hopes for the
team remain and her impact will
continue to be felt in the Stanlord
program, if not as the magic hand
from behind the arc, then as the
guiding voice behind liei team
mates.
