Visualize l>eing the last person standing in the
way ola victory or a loss, directing your teammates
during a timeol chaotic shouting and high tensions.
Picture yoursell lacing seven players who have the
single mission of whipping a hall at a speed ol up to
50 miles per hour past your body. Finally, imagine
yourselldoing all ol this while in water. This is jnsi
an average day lor Nick Kllis, the goalie lor the Stan
lord men's water polo team.
Kllis, a junior, encounters this sort of challenge
through a combination ol grueling practices and
heart-pounding matches. More impressively, he
docs soin an impressively modest way with an undv

ing love for the game and with incomparable excel
lence. Furthermore, with everything that such an
athletic commitment can do to one's true nature,
F.lhs tries to continue being the "real Nick Fllis" —
selfless, academically foc used and constantlv smil

I hrough hard work and a pure knack lor stop
ping the ball, Ellis, who was named .1 first team All-
American last year, has suddenly thrust himself into
the national water polo spotlight. After redshirting
his first year at Stanford. Fllis made the starting line
up in his first eligible season of play and performed
solidly for the Cardinal. The team finished with a
stellar 22-b record and .1 second-place finish in the

N( A A Fournament.
During I lie exciting run to the
< hampionship game last year, it is
not an uncommon sight to see an
opponent swim down the pool w itli
the ball, in a one-on-none last
break, and find himselldenied of a
seetningb simple goal. I lead coach
Dante Dettamanti appreciates this
unique skill.
Its reallv critical .it this level to
have an outstanding goalkeeper.
When von have a goalie who makes
the great l>lo< ks like he does, it re
alb inspires the rest of the team."
Dettamanti said. "I le is \er\ consis
tent in the (act tli.it he not only
makes the great saves, but he also

makes the ones that be has to
make."
Freshman two-nietet defender
(.1 ug ( rum added, li seems like
opposing teams are at a disadvan
tage when thev gel a last break on
Ni< k."
Hllis attributes some ol his suc
cess to Ins mental approat h.
"When 1 get into the pool, 1 al
ways repeat the phrase, 'blank
\our mind." I believe ihat. as a play
er, I alreatb know what I have to
do before get into the pool. When ii
comes time, I do not think a playei
should be thinking so much about
a particular game situation," he
said.
Fllis did not develop such a res
olute altitude overnight. Much ol
Fllis's succ ess has come as a result ol
man\ years plaving watei polo as a
club and high school sport. Fllis,

who (omes from ()range (louniv,
( alii., bewail his long join ne\ to lop
ol iht' water polo world when a
friend introduced him and his
brother. Malt, to the sport.
"M\ mom enrolled ns lor swim
lessons, bill we got tired of swim
ming, and one ol my Iriends sug
gested playing water polo," Kllis
said. "We tried out and nn brothet
and I just ended up loving it."
Kllis believes that his dec isioti to
eommit so much lime to the sport
ol watei polo( anieasa result ol the
challenge and fierce compel it ion
th.il the sport entails.
"Watei polo is a ver\ complete
spoil. It's |iist a game that has so
main variables going on. I enjoy the
challenges tli.it water polo li.is to
()Her andconstantl) having loreline
m\ skills io try and slay on lop."
Kllis recognizes thai his ambi

tion lobe the best has been inspired
by his lile -his br< >iher Mail and Ibr
mer coach I)a\e Mikesell.
"Mall pi.ins with more passion
and intensity than any otliei plaver
thai I've evci known," Kllis said.
" I raits like ih.it are dangerous in
the pool. It's something I respect .1
lot, ,ind lie's taught me a lot about
1 hose aspects ol die game."
Kllis also attributes much of the
qualities and abilities that he has
developed to Mikesell, his first
water polo coach.
I le really developed nn under
standing and abilities 111 the game.
K.vcn time when I would be down
and games would be lough, he
would be 1 he first person to reaf
firm his faith in me, push me to
pi,u harder and at a higher level,"
lie said.
Mis extensive experience as a

youngster and as a collegiate ath
lete has helped Kllis develop into .1
team player who values the li iend
sliips and bonds 1 hat he forms.
"Niek-O is someone who just
says everything with a smile. In the
pool, when he says something, peo
ple just listen and they do whatevei
he says," said teammate senior field
pla\er IVtct (Xsborn. "Nick does
not care about the hvpe he gets
from the water polo world. He is
|iist doing it because he loves to do
11 «ind he just so happens to be one
oh he best goalies Stanford hasevet
had."
Despite Ins success as a water
polo player. Kills, who majors ins( i
ence and tec Imology in society, still
understands that he came to Stan
ford primarily as a student. When
asked about the possibility ol repre
senting the I nited States in the

2001 Olympic Games, he equivo
cated.
"I have more immediate things
to worry about, such as college. I
would love to move out ofilie I lin
ed Stales and help a developing
country discover what technology
is all about," he said.
fhrough Ins excellence both in
and out ol the pool, I- Ills has shown
an impressive well-roimdedness.
Willi every thing going lor him, Kllis
has not 101 gotten the reason he con
stantly toils 10 become the best and
help make his team the lust.
"We definitely want to win the
N('A\ championship," Kllis said.
"It's very possible lor us even yeai.
It'll jusi come down to everybody
being 011 the same page and work
ing really hard. I do not think any
body 011 the team will be happy
with anything less than that."

Visualize l>eing the last person standing in the
way ola victory or a loss, directing your teammates
during a timeol chaotic shouting and high tensions.
Picture yoursell lacing seven players who have the
single mission of whipping a hall at a speed ol up to
50 miles per hour past your body. Finally, imagine
yourselldoing all ol this while in water. This is jnsi
an average day lor Nick Kllis, the goalie lor the Stan
lord men's water polo team.
Kllis, a junior, encounters this sort of challenge
through a combination ol grueling practices and
heart-pounding matches. More impressively, he
docs soin an impressively modest way with an undv

ing love for the game and with incomparable excel
lence. Furthermore, with everything that such an
athletic commitment can do to one's true nature,
F.lhs tries to continue being the "real Nick Fllis" —
selfless, academically foc used and constantlv smil
ing.
I hrough hard work and a pure knack lor stop
ping the ball, Ellis, who was named .1 first team All-
American last year, has suddenly thrust himself into
the national water polo spotlight. After redshirting
his first year at Stanford. Fllis made the starting line
up in his first eligible season of play and performed
solidly for the Cardinal. The team finished with a
stellar 22-b record and .1 second-place finish in the

During I lie exciting run to the
< hampionship game last year, it is
not an uncommon sight to see an
opponent swim down the pool w itli
the ball, in a one-on-none last
break, and find himselldenied of a
seetningb simple goal. I lead coach
Dante Dettamanti appreciates this
unique skill.
Its reallv critical .it this level to
have an outstanding goalkeeper.
When von have a goalie who makes
the great l>lo< ks like he does, it re
alb inspires the rest of the team."
Dettamanti said. "I le is \er\ consis
tent in the (act tli.it he not only
makes the great saves, but he also

makes the ones that be has to
make."
Freshman two-nietet defender
(.1 ug ( rum added, li seems like
opposing teams are at a disadvan
tage when thev gel a last break on
Ni< k."
Hllis attributes some ol his suc
cess to Ins mental approat h.
"When 1 get into the pool, 1 al
ways repeat the phrase, 'blank
\our mind." I believe ihat. as a play
er, I alreatb know what I have to
do before get into the pool. When ii
comes time, I do not think a playei
should be thinking so much about
a particular game situation," he
said.
Fllis did not develop such a res
olute altitude overnight. Much ol
Fllis's succ ess has come as a result ol
man\ years plaving watei polo as a
club and high school sport. Fllis,

who (omes from ()range (louniv,

ol iht' water polo world when a
friend introduced him and his
brother. Malt, to the sport.
"M\ mom enrolled ns lor swim
lessons, bill we got tired of swim
ming, and one ol my Iriends sug
gested playing water polo," Kllis
said. "We tried out and nn brothet
and I just ended up loving it."
Kllis believes that his dec isioti to
eommit so much lime to the sport
ol watei polo( anieasa result ol the
challenge and fierce compel it ion
th.il the sport entails.
"Watei polo is a ver\ complete
spoil. It's |iist a game that has so
main variables going on. I enjoy the
challenges tli.it water polo li.is to

Kllis recognizes thai his ambi

tion lobe the best has been inspired
by his lile -his br< >iher Mail and Ibr
mer coach I)a\e Mikesell.
"Mall pi.ins with more passion
and intensity than any otliei plaver
thai I've evci known," Kllis said.
" I raits like ih.it are dangerous in
the pool. It's something I respect .1
