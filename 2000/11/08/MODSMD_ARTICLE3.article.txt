Florida tips scales
The suspensel'ul back-and
lorth electoral tallies on Flection
Night mirrored the unpre
dictable, competitive nature of
the entire campaign, but the big
story of the evening was the status
of Florida, whose 25 electoral
votes had been fiercely sought
after bv both candidates.
Karl) last night, optimism
surged through the Gore camp
when the (lock sit tick 7 in
Nashville, as CNN called Florida
lor the vice president.
I he network quickly followed
ibis up bv plat ing Michigan and
Illinois, other crucial battle
ground st.«tes, in Gore's column,
along with Democratic strong
holds such as New Jersey, Massa
chusetts, Maryland and (onnecti
ciit, establishing him as the early
favorite.
However, CNN and the other
networks rescinded their call on
Florida less than two hours later,

blaming errant exit poll data, and
placed the state's electoral votes
back in the undecided column.
Gore officials remained confi
dent. Deputy Communications
Director Mark Fabiani told CNN,
"Florida is the key: the candidate
who wins Florida will be the next
president ol the Cnited States. It
was called lor Al Gore earlier in
the evening, and we think it's
going to end up with Al (lore."
Several hours after all polls had
closed nationwide, it became clear
that the Flectoral College out
come was predicated 011 the Flori
da result, and after Florida had
been called for Bush and then
taken away from him, the situa
tion still remained uncertain.

Throughout the day. both par
lies' officials spoke of the massive
"ground war" underway to in
crease voter turnout in key states
across 1 he nation.
According to National
Spokesman Doug llattaway,

interviews to local television sta
tions in key media markets across
the country, such as Albu

Gore's wife Tipper and his
running mate, Connecticut Sen.

pated in radio call-ins from
Nashville, and early in the day the
campaign believed its efforts were
bearing fruit.
"Turnout has been very high,
<md we expect that to benefit Al
Gore ,uid the Democratic candi
dates," I lattway said.
Meanwhile, the Gore cam
paign employed numerous surro
gates to target core constituencies
in areas around the country. Rev.

of Philadelphia, encouraging
black voters to go to the polls.
(lore's early wins in states such
as Pennsvlvania, Illinois and
Michigan seemed to relied the
success of these measures, partic -
ularly among the labor unions
and black communities.
However, the GOP was able
to mobilize its supporters
throughout the South and Mid
west well enough to virtually
sweep these regions, including
Tennessee, forcing Gore to suf
fer the indignity of a loss in his
home slate.

showing yesterday.
Nader led lar short of the na
tional "> percent threshold he
would have needed to secure mil
lions ol dollars in federal funds
lot the (ireen Party in 2004, lead
ing (lore Campaign Manager
Donna Brazile to describe

Nader's candidacy as, "A lot of
hype but not a lot of votes."
But the numbers reveal that
Nader could be a determining
