Stanford's no neon let ence
si liedulc was arguablv one of the
toughest m thecountiy; the Cardi
nal took on live other tournament
teams, including undefeated and
lop-seeded Notre I)ame. Although
the (lardinal sustained three losses
in I'ac-10 plav, all the losses came
toseeded teams — No. 2 Washing
ton, No. (> I CI«A and No. 8 Cali
fornia — and all three were on the
r< >ad.
I he I'ac-10 sends seven teams
to die tournament, the most repre
sentatives from any conference in
then mil try, indicative of how dtlli
< nit a conference schedule the (lar
dinal lias had lo plav.
"We definitely went through
some rough patches during I'ac
10s, bin I think we can compete
with am ol those teams." said se
nior co-captain Christy
I.a I'ierre.
San |ose Slate, Stanford's oppo
nent in the first round, is a familiar
one. I lie ( ardinal beat the Spar
tans handilv, 3-0, Sept. 24 on a pair
of goals li'oin sophomore forward
Mania Wallis and another from
freshman forward Britiam
()liveira.
but aftei steadily improving
ovei the < ourse ol ihe season, the
Spai i,ins are one of the tourna
ment s Cinderella teams. San
|ose State is die onlv team ol the
IS participants in the tourna
ment with a losing record on the
\ear (10-12-1 overall, 3-3-1
Western Athletic Conference).
I he Spartans needed lo win
three straight games in the WA(
toui namcnt, including a 4-2
upset ovei No. I-seed Southern
Methodist, in on lei lo receive an
automatic bid as the WA( 1 repre
sentative in die NCAA tourna
ment.
I he Spartans are led In junior
midfielder krislina |acob, w ho was
named the most valuable plaver in
the WA( ! tournament.
I wo other San |ose Stale

weapons are senior forward )ulie
Brum and senior midfielder

fort he team lead with I (> points on
the war — a total ol six goals and
lour assisis each.
In the net, the Spai tans si a 11
sophomore goalkeeper Er\n
Mever, who lias allowed 28 goals
and lias recorded 88 saves during
die regular season.
" I liev are muc Ii belter than
die team we beat in September."
said Stanford head coach Andv
Nelson.
Stanlonl will need lo exert of
fensive pressiu eon I he Spartans in
ordei to defend its home tin I. I lie

scoring tandem ol Wallis and fel
low freshman forward Manic
Ward will need to continue to
shine as ihc\ did when the (l.irdi

games.

continue to lake advantage ol these

"I think we are peaking at jusi
the i iglit time, we are reach to go.
Ii is going to be a whole new sea
