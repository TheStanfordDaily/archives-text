# Squash's gourd is tough to crack
## 
### MALCOLM LEVINE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Depending on how you look at it, squash is ei
ther a "fleshy fruit related to the pumpkins and
the gourds" or a fast-paced and highly intelli
gent game played in a walled-in court. At Stan
ford, the former is not that popular but the latter
is beginning to sprout everywhere, as Cardinal
Squash is quickly becoming a program to be
reckoned with across the country.
Last year Stanford, in only its second year of
existence, won Division E at the National Team
Championships. Led by returning seniors
Steven Wei, Jason Miller and Mark Goldenson
and an exciting crop of fresh man talent, the Car
dinal refuses to rest on last year's laurels as it
competes fora National Championship in the
more-competitive Division 1).
Last weekend, the Cardinal started its season
in Berkeley at the biannual Big Squash. Hin
dered by injuries to two top players, the team
stumbled out of the blocks and lost to California,
7 matches to 2. 1 lowever, the team's expecta
tions remain high as it prepares fora three-day
trip to face four top-30 teams at Hobart College
in New York, beginning Nov. 16.

The team ventures east again in January for
four more tough matchups, including games
against Vale and Navy, ranked 4th and 9th re
spectively in the nation. Stanford's relatively
short regular season consists of these two trips
and two additional faceoft's against Cal, which
hopefully will lead to an invitation to the Nation
al Team Championships in late February.
It is rare fora club team to travel so exten
sively, but the Cardinal team is not your average
bunch of guys — and a girl. This group is one of
the most unique on campus and has an ex
tremely varied athletic history.
Wei is the team's top-ranked player and one
of the few with a long history of playing squash,
having excelled in high school at perennial pow
erhouse Milton Academy.
Freshman Paul Valiant, the Cardinal's No. 6
player, also played at Milton. Valiant's talent in
squash is obvious from his outstanding seeding
as a freshman, but it pales in comparison to his
achievements outside the four-walled squash
court.
Valiant is one of the top mathematicians in
the country for his age — he finished AP Calcu
lus BC in 7th grade and is enrolled in two grad
uate-level courses in his first quarter — often ex

celling in international competitions.
According to team treasurer Jason Miller,
Valiant is just one of the "many amazing team
mates that make up such a great team dynamic."
Miller is equally impressed by the astonishing
rate at which some oi his teammates have
learned the game.
"Sam Gellman and Rich Sherwood, both
freshman, started the game a two months ago
and are incredibly good already — I mean as
good as most people are having played for sev
eral years," Miller said.
Sherwood, responsible tor one of the two vic
tories against Cal, has used his experience from
tennis to expedite his learning and heightened
sense <>t the game, while Gellman relies on gen
eral athleticism that he cultivated by playing
other competitive sports, especially volleyball.
Gellman has been instantly captivated by the
sport, immediately loving the "finesse and de
ception needed in such a strategic game."
The (Cardinal's rapid progression as a team is
most impressive, considering the uphill battle it
laces due to its status as a club team. Unlike the
vast majority of its opponents, Cardinal Squash
remains a < luh sport because of re
