# SoCal nightmare continuing for Polo
## 
### ELIZABETH MIIN 
Sometimes people have certain dreams with
such frequency that they actually begin won
dering whether or not the dream exists in their
mind or in reality.
But for the Stanford men's water polo team,
that phenomenon is not a recurring dream but
a recurring nightmare. The subject of the
team's nightmare? Losing.
After two rough losses this past weekend in
Southern California to No. 1 UCLA (17-2, 7-0
MPSF) and No. 2 LSC (17-4, 5-2), the team's
chances of making it out of the Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation tournament and onto the
NCAA playoffs are looking slim.
Although the Cardinal is currently ranked
fifth in the nation according to the Collegiate
Water Polo Association's Top 20 Poll, under
NCAA rules, only two teams from each division
are allowed to compete in the playoffs.
Even though all nine teams in the MPSF are
currently ranked in the top 10, making the
MPSF unquestionably the most competitive di

vision in the nation, only two can go to the
NCAA playoffs.
In the past, the Cardinal had no problem fin
ishing in the top two spots in the MPSF, but this
season has proved to be more challenging. The
loss of starters from past seasons and an inex
perienced squad have all led to Stanford's mis
fortunes.
According to head coach Dante Dettamanti,
individual talent on the team is simply not
enough. He said the team must pool its talents
and work together to be victorious.
"We have different guys coming through at
different times," said Dettamanti. "We need
everybody to come through all of the time."
The desperate need for Stanford to play to
gether cohesively was seen this past weekend.
On Saturday, the top-ranked Bruins cruised to
an easy 10-3 victory over Stanford. The Bruins
won their 13th game in a row at home at the
Rose Bowl Aquatics Center in Pasadena.
Olympian Sean Kern led L'CIA, scoring three
goals to improve the team's record to 10-2 over
all and 0-0 in MPSF play.

The Bruins opened the game with a quick
scoring burst, tallying a goal 10 seconds into the
match. Senior Mark Amott answered with a
goal for Stanford, but UCLA, extended its lead
to 5-1 at halftime before finishing the game off
in the second half. Junior Todd Snider and
sophomore jell Nesmith also scored for the
Cardinal.
On Sunday, Stanford battled USC in a non
league match up, only to find that its luck had
worsened from the day before. After losing a 5-
3 decision to USC in the NorCal tournament in
September, Stanford's 11-6 loss was a disap
pointment.
The Trojans exploded for five goals in the
second period to break a 1-1 tie forged in the
first quarter. USC continued to dominate the
match, leaving the Cardinal scoreless in the
third quarter. Snider, senior I'eter Osborn,
freshman Mike Derse and sophomores Peter
1 ludnut and Jeff Cluyman scored for Stanford.
This weekend, Stanford .suffered a lack of
