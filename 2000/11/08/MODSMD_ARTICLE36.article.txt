istlies, are .i common choice for
worshippers. I here are main ben
efits to involvement in a club oft his
t\ pe. (ireen said.
"fellowships help students
lorm friendships and often pro
vide safe spates where students
can talk about life issues that can
not be addressed in the- (lass
room," (ireen said, "liv eiuourag
ing students todeveh>pa more ma

member of Intervarsitv.
"When I came to Stanlord, I
needed something to help me so
lidifv m\ faith, to find a place," she
said. " I his is a community where I
have found what I needed, and it
has strengthened tn\ beliefs."
Sophomore Brandon Hyde
said he It'll at home in Corner

"I went to (Cornerstone and fell
in love with it immediatelv," lie

said. "I really felt at home because
it is a very authentic communitv,
and the people I interact with

Worship through song supple
ments the wealth of registered
Christian organizations, lestinio
nv A (Cappella, a singing group, lo
nises on songs that express the
(Christian faith.
(iroup members say these tvpes
of activities are usually more than
the typical meet, greet, see-you
next-week extrat urriculars.
"We fellowship together and
support each other," junior Fiton
Francisco said. "We also discuss a
variety of laith issues.
I he existence of a wide variety
ol (lubs would seem to indicate a
very broad-minded community,
but some students sav that this
abundance belies intolerance to
ward certain gi <nips.
I .ast winter, an inlet laith group
held a meeting entitled "Fmbrac
ing Fxile." ()ne ol the most press
ing issues dis< ussed was the hard
ship ol being a sexual minoiil\ in
main ol the (Christian groups on
campus.
Some of the established groups
have a history of great intolerance,
senior Anlboil\ Gutierrez said.
" I here's a dillerence between
hate speet hand hale speech
(oik lied in love because with the
first vou can discount the person
saving it, he said, "but il someone
confers his opinion, that who
you've chosen to be is wrong, on a
superior being, it is much more
difficult to combat I lie hurl lie has
caused."
I he parlit ipants also discussed
re(ent refusals to promote gay in
dividuals to leadership p< tsiiions in
some of the ( lubs, ('.utierrez said.

I he need arose lor a group lo
nising on lesbian, gay and bisexu
al issues iu the (Christian communi
ty. Gutierrez, with the help of
other students and (ireen, created
a group called the Rainbow ( hi is
tian Fellowship.
"It was ver\ small but students
needed to know that there is a
space out there dealing with these
issues, and that we, 100, are foster
ing a communitv tliat can con
tribute to Christianity," Gutierrez

said.
I here are many students on
campus taking their own route by
participating in weekly llible stud
ies, faith discussions or attending
services.
"Whydo I gotochurch?" junior
1 ylet Ziemann asked i hetoi i< all\.
"I because it allows me to con
template my faith and gives me
time to 111 ink in a non-academu
sphere, in a community that shares
m\ goals and beliefs."
