# Assigning the future of the Internet
## 
### LUSAN CHUA 
While the American people were elec t
ing ihe next president, people in cyber
space were selecting the future leaders ol
one of the Internet's most prominent gov
erning bodies. On ()ct. 10, Internet users
around the world logged on to vole lor live
representatives to the Internet Corpora
tion lor Assigned Names and Numbers,
the international group charged with
making critical technical decisions about
the. Internet.
The value of a good name
ICANN manages domain names — the
combination of letters ending in".coin."
".org" and ".gov" that marks the location
of a Web site. ()n one level, domain names
are simply pari of a system lor routing dig
ital packets across a network — a system
that we might regard as obscure, overly
technical and, well, boring.
And yet werel) on this sy stem even da\
to send messages, search lor directions,
buy books and compact discs and pla\
games on the Internet. Domain names are
such an integral part of our online experi
ence that, in some ways, they have become
synonymous with the Internet itself. For
example, how many of your friends thai
graduated last year began working lot a
".com"?

Domain names have developed
in intrinsic value; owning a do-

main name is viewed In some as
analogous to owning a piece ol
the Internet — like real estate

in cyberspace. And, like am
other i\ pe of "propertv," do
main names have created

complex disputes about
ownership thai must be
settled on an interna-

tional level. This is
where I('.ANN, and iis
lirsl global election, Ik

comes interesting.
In the next lew weeks
l( !ANN's board of direc
tors will make some im
portant dec isions lo tlu
future of the Internet —
decisions about how

trademark disputes are
settled across international
borders, dec isions abou

whether new domains like
".bi/," ".kids'' and".info" get
created. Willi the perceived

scarcity of domain names d e
aling a market lor speculation
in the millions, (earlier this

year, "lnisiness.com" sold lor .1
record $7.5 million), these are
decisions that main people are

looking ai with extreme interest.
Meanwhile, free speech advocates arc

looking at ihese decisions
with some concern, since
these are essentially choices
about access and control ola

medium (bunded on the
free exchange ol ideas.
But, in many
ways, 111 is election went
beyond choosing the

next ".com. " There
are some who be
lieve that this elec
tion was important
because ii was the

first time in the his
tory of ICANN —
and the history of
the Internet, for
that matter — that

individual users
from around the
world would be able
to significantly influ-

ence how ihe In
lernet is managed.
And then there are
others who remain

skeptical about the real
extent of this influence.
In full \ understand this
skepticism, 11 is important

to know a little about ICANN's history.
History of ICANN: the official and
unofficial versions
The official history of the Internet Cor
poration for Assigned Names and Num
bers is realh (juite simple: It was created by
the Department of Commerce iti 1997.
I lie explosion ofe-commerce had made it
cleat that the Internet had outgrown its
humble origin as a research network and
that it was no longer appropriate for the
U.S. government to manage its technical
backbone. ICANN was created to put do
main names and other critical technical
functions into the hands of an internation
al. private sector organization. Simple
enough? Keep reading.
I he unofficial version of the story is
fuzzier than an English major. Rather
than smoothly transitioning from public to
private sector management, ICANN de
veloped through a series of awkward
growth spurts, like a teenager with identi
ty issues.
No one could really figure out what
ICANN was, what its purpose was, who
was making decisions and ultimately re
sponsible lot keeping the Internet run
ning. Theoretically, the orporation was
supposed to be run by a "bottom-up con-

sensus. an ambiguous lerm that means I hat the lii
i k- people are supposed lo voire I heir opinions and
eleel repi'esenlalives lo implement their ideas.
Sounds like representative government? Yes, ac
cording lo one theory. lint in reality, stakeholders
in K .ANN held strongk divergent opinions about
whether this was supposed to be about Internet
governance, international commerce or technical
management. And main looked lo this election as
the Rorschach tesi of their ihcon on the copora
tion's true purpose.
The election results
Needless to say, lOANN election was a closely
watched and much anticipated event. Some be
lieved thai it would reinvent democracy in the digi
tal age ()ihei s believed that n would bring the cat
astrophic downfall of the Internet. Still others be
lieved that no one would ( are enough lo vote, and
it would be a complete!) anti-climatic event thai
would prove that the Internet was still strictly
let hie (iountrv.
In the end. none of these premonitions tame
true. Instead, five somewhat-predictable winners
were selected t<> join nine all each-scaled members

on the I( IANN's board of directors.
Rather than electing Michael |ordan ot |esse
Ventura (as some participants feared), KIANN's
voters chose a Japanese Internet service provider,
an Americ an network operator, a (>erman ha< ker,
a South American computer science scholar and an
African domain name registrar.
I'liree out of the five have been involved with
l( :.\NN since its formation, and all of them have the
technical background necessary to understand
K IANN's core functions. Apart from a few te( linical
glitches with the online voting system, the election
went smoothly, and more than 34,000 people par
ticipated worldwide.
But the real question is: I low many of them ac -
tually understood what they were voting for? It
would be difficult fora voter in this election to make
a full) informed vote simply because few people can
really explain K.ANN, not even those who have
helped build and sustain ii.
Ihe direction that K.ANN will take after this
election is unclear. But one thing seems certain —
the newly elected board members will force K '.ANN
to confront its identity issues, to gel beyond the
teenage angst lo full-fledged, sell-aware maturity.
At least two of the new board members have al
ready threatened to shake ICANN lo its founda
tions. Ihe North American representative, Karl
Auerbac h. recently told Salon magazine that he be
lieves the corporation needs a"( California remodel

ing jol>, .ind lie advocates a fundamental restruc
turing. Mis proposals are certain to create chaos
among the current hoard members and controver
s\ amongst the ICANN participants.
Perhaps (his new tension is ,i good thing because
it will force a debate on issues long in need of reso
lution. Regardless of whether IC -ANN needs a lloor
to-<filing makeover 01 just a simple relinishing, it
does need loconfront fundamental questions about
the role of its membership.
Now that it has thousands of members around
the world, K'.ANN must decide which version ol
the story is true. These members need to know
whether ICANN is making arcane technical dec i
sions about a root server or critical architectural
decisions about access to the Internet. I hese mem
bers need lo know whether the coporation is about
representative government or about making sure
Web sites can be lound.
Otherwise, thousands ol Internet users will c ast
meaningless votes because they won't really know
what they are voting for. And, contrary to the values
behind ICANN's creation, the Internet will remain
in the- hands of a lew good technologists, who, like
the YVi/ard ol'Oz, would keep things running be
hind the c urtain, while the Dorothys of the world
are kept in the dark.

The value of a good name
ICANN manages domain names — the
combination of letters ending in".coin."
".org" and ".gov" that marks the location
of a Web site. ()n one level, domain names
are simply pari of a system lor routing dig
ital packets across a network — a system
that we might regard as obscure, overly
technical and, well, boring.
And yet werel) on this sy stem even da\
to send messages, search lor directions,
buy books and compact discs and pla\
games on the Internet. Domain names are
such an integral part of our online experi
ence that, in some ways, they have become
synonymous with the Internet itself. For
example, how many of your friends thai
graduated last year began working lot a
".com"?

Domain names have developed
in intrinsic value; owning a do-

main name is viewed In some as
analogous to owning a piece ol
the Internet — like real estate

in cyberspace. And, like am
other i\ pe of "propertv," do
main names have created

complex disputes about
ownership thai must be
settled on an interna-

tional level. This is
where I('.ANN, and iis
lirsl global election, Ik

comes interesting.
In the next lew weeks
l( !ANN's board of direc
tors will make some im
portant dec isions lo tlu
future of the Internet —
decisions about how

trademark disputes are
settled across international
borders, dec isions abou

whether new domains like
".bi/," ".kids'' and".info" get
created. Willi the perceived

scarcity of domain names d e
aling a market lor speculation
in the millions, (earlier this

year, "lnisiness.com" sold lor .1
record $7.5 million), these are
decisions that main people are

looking ai with extreme interest.
Meanwhile, free speech advocates arc

looking at ihese decisions
with some concern, since
these are essentially choices
about access and control ola

medium (bunded on the
free exchange ol ideas.
But, in many
ways, 111 is election went
beyond choosing the

next ".com. " There
are some who be
lieve that this elec
tion was important
because ii was the

first time in the his
tory of ICANN —
and the history of
the Internet, for
that matter — that

individual users
from around the
world would be able
to significantly influ-

ence how ihe In
lernet is managed.
And then there are
others who remain

skeptical about the real
extent of this influence.
In full \ understand this
skepticism, 11 is important

to know a little about ICANN's history.
History of ICANN: the official and
unofficial versions
The official history of the Internet Cor
poration for Assigned Names and Num
bers is realh (juite simple: It was created by
the Department of Commerce iti 1997.
I lie explosion ofe-commerce had made it
cleat that the Internet had outgrown its
humble origin as a research network and
that it was no longer appropriate for the
U.S. government to manage its technical
backbone. ICANN was created to put do
main names and other critical technical
functions into the hands of an internation
al. private sector organization. Simple
enough? Keep reading.
I he unofficial version of the story is
fuzzier than an English major. Rather
than smoothly transitioning from public to
private sector management, ICANN de
veloped through a series of awkward
growth spurts, like a teenager with identi
ty issues.
No one could really figure out what
ICANN was, what its purpose was, who
was making decisions and ultimately re
sponsible lot keeping the Internet run
ning. Theoretically, the orporation was
supposed to be run by a "bottom-up con-

sensus. an ambiguous lerm that means I hat the lii
i k- people are supposed lo voire I heir opinions and
eleel repi'esenlalives lo implement their ideas.
Sounds like representative government? Yes, ac
cording lo one theory. lint in reality, stakeholders
in K .ANN held strongk divergent opinions about
whether this was supposed to be about Internet
governance, international commerce or technical
management. And main looked lo this election as
the Rorschach tesi of their ihcon on the copora
tion's true purpose.
The election results
Needless to say, lOANN election was a closely
watched and much anticipated event. Some be
lieved thai it would reinvent democracy in the digi
tal age ()ihei s believed that n would bring the cat
astrophic downfall of the Internet. Still others be
lieved that no one would ( are enough lo vote, and
it would be a complete!) anti-climatic event thai
would prove that the Internet was still strictly
let hie (iountrv.
In the end. none of these premonitions tame
true. Instead, five somewhat-predictable winners
were selected t<> join nine all each-scaled members

on the I( IANN's board of directors.
Rather than electing Michael |ordan ot |esse
Ventura (as some participants feared), KIANN's
voters chose a Japanese Internet service provider,
an Americ an network operator, a (>erman ha< ker,
a South American computer science scholar and an
African domain name registrar.
I'liree out of the five have been involved with
l( :.\NN since its formation, and all of them have the
technical background necessary to understand
K IANN's core functions. Apart from a few te( linical
glitches with the online voting system, the election
went smoothly, and more than 34,000 people par
ticipated worldwide.
But the real question is: I low many of them ac -
tually understood what they were voting for? It
would be difficult fora voter in this election to make
a full) informed vote simply because few people can
really explain K.ANN, not even those who have
helped build and sustain ii.
Ihe direction that K.ANN will take after this
election is unclear. But one thing seems certain —
the newly elected board members will force K '.ANN
to confront its identity issues, to gel beyond the
teenage angst lo full-fledged, sell-aware maturity.
At least two of the new board members have al
ready threatened to shake ICANN lo its founda
tions. Ihe North American representative, Karl
Auerbac h. recently told Salon magazine that he be
lieves the corporation needs a"( California remodel

ing jol>, .ind lie advocates a fundamental restruc
turing. Mis proposals are certain to create chaos
among the current hoard members and controver
s\ amongst the ICANN participants.
Perhaps (his new tension is ,i good thing because
it will force a debate on issues long in need of reso
lution. Regardless of whether IC -ANN needs a lloor
to-<filing makeover 01 just a simple relinishing, it
does need loconfront fundamental questions about
the role of its membership.
Now that it has thousands of members around
the world, K'.ANN must decide which version ol
the story is true. These members need to know
whether ICANN is making arcane technical dec i
sions about a root server or critical architectural
