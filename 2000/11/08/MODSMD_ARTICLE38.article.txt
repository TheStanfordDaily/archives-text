# Assigning the future of the Internet

### LUSAN CHUA 
While the American people were elec t
ing ihe next president, people in cyber
space were selecting the future leaders ol
one of the Internet's most prominent gov
erning bodies. On ()ct. 10, Internet users
around the world logged on to vole lor live
representatives to the Internet Corpora
tion lor Assigned Names and Numbers,
the international group charged with
making critical technical decisions about
the. Internet.
The value of a good name
ICANN manages domain names — the
combination of letters ending in".coin."
".org" and ".gov" that marks the location
of a Web site. ()n one level, domain names
are simply pari of a system lor routing dig
ital packets across a network — a system
that we might regard as obscure, overly
technical and, well, boring.
And yet werel) on this sy stem even da\
to send messages, search lor directions,
buy books and compact discs and pla\
games on the Internet. Domain names are
such an integral part of our online experi
ence that, in some ways, they have become
synonymous with the Internet itself. For
example, how many of your friends thai
graduated last year began working lot a
".com"?

Domain names have developed
in intrinsic value; owning a do-

main name is viewed In some as
analogous to owning a piece ol
the Internet — like real estate

in cyberspace. And, like am
other i\ pe of "propertv," do
main names have created

complex disputes about
ownership thai must be
settled on an interna-

tional level. This is
where I('.ANN, and iis
lirsl global election, Ik

comes interesting.
In the next lew weeks
l( !ANN's board of direc
tors will make some im
portant dec isions lo tlu
future of the Internet —
decisions about how

trademark disputes are
settled across international
borders, dec isions abou

whether new domains like
".bi/," ".kids'' and".info" get
created. Willi the perceived

scarcity of domain names d e
aling a market lor speculation
in the millions, (earlier this

year, "lnisiness.com" sold lor .1
record $7.5 million), these are
decisions that main people are

looking ai with extreme interest.
Meanwhile, free speech advocates arc

looking at ihese decisions
with some concern, since
these are essentially choices
about access and control ola

medium (bunded on the
free exchange ol ideas.
But, in many
ways, 111 is election went
beyond choosing the

next ".com. " There
are some who be
lieve that this elec
tion was important
because ii was the

first time in the his
tory of ICANN —
and the history of
the Internet, for
that matter — that

individual users
from around the
world would be able
to significantly influ-

ence how ihe In
lernet is managed.
And then there are
others who remain

skeptical about the real
extent of this influence.
In full \ understand this
skepticism, 11 is important

to know a little about ICANN's history.
History of ICANN: the official and
unofficial versions
The official history of the Internet Cor
poration for Assigned Names and Num
bers is realh (juite simple: It was created by
the Department of Commerce iti 1997.
I lie explosion ofe-commerce had made it
cleat that the Internet had outgrown its
humble origin as a research network and
that it was no longer appropriate for the
U.S. government to manage its technical
backbone. ICANN was created to put do
main names and other critical technical
functions into the hands of an internation
al. private sector organization. Simple
enough? Keep reading.
I he unofficial version of the story is
fuzzier than an English major. Rather
than smoothly transitioning from public to
private sector management, ICANN de
veloped through a series of awkward
growth spurts, like a teenager with identi
ty issues.
No one could really figure out what
ICANN was, what its purpose was, who
was making decisions and ultimately re
sponsible lot keeping the Internet run
ning. Theoretically, the orporation was
supposed to be run by a "bottom-up con-
