But in the Vallev, belore companies can
compete lor funding, the) must compete for

Lawyers are in such high demand in 11u-
Valley, that companies need to pitch tlu ii busi
ness pi,ins to potential lawyers. And just as
there are dillercni levels of prestige when it
conies to venture capital linns, there are dil
lerent levels of prestige when it conies to law

Venture Law Group is both one of the
newest and one ol the most prestigious law

In addition, Johnson turned
