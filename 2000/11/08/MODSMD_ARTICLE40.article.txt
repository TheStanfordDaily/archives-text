I lie clock speed, in Mega

desktop processor will achieve
In the third quarter of next
year, according to Intel execu
tives. The Pentium 4 leatures
Intel's first new an hitedure in
five years and is set to debut in
a few weeks at ( lock speeds of
1.4 (>h/ and above. Initially,
the chip will be used iu costly,
high-performance PC.s. How
ever. Intel expects that it will
be available to mainstream
users for as little as $1,500 be
fore the end of 2001.

the opto-chip, a device devices
that promises to convert elec

at speeds 10 times faster than
current electronics. At that
rate, a single liber-optic (able
could carry a bandwidth of al
most 120 gigahertz — enough
to handle some 1,000 cable
channels. Prototype devices

The price, in dollars, of
koski Snow Sports' MonoTrac
ski-bike. Modeled alter down
hill bikes but without pedals,
the MonoTrac is the first pro
duction ski-bike with a high
performance long-travel sus
pension. Its shock absorbers
permit a full eight inches of
travel in the front and the rear,
