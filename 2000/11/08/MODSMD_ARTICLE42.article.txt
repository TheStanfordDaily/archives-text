# Bodybuilding stimulant may be deadly

### 
(AP) — Kphedra, an herbal stimulant used
by millions of Americans for bodybuilding and
weight loss, can cause heart attacks, stroke,
sci/ures and death in otherwise healths voting
people, reseat < hers say.
Ai least 51 deaths and about 1,000 reports ol
complications have been linked to ephedra
since the mid-1000s.
I he rcsean hers concluded that the dietary
supplement, also known as ma Iniang, poses a
risk that far outweighs any benefits it might
have.
" I hey're uncommon events, but the\ re se
rious." said I )r. Neal L. Benowilz, chief of < lini
i.il pharmacologs .it the I'niversit\ ol Califor
nia at S.iii I ratK isco. " I he substance is unrea
sonabh hazardous as marketed."
I lie research, commissioned bv the Food
and I)rug Administration, appeal sin the New
Knglancl |ournal of Medicine, which moved up
release ol the study to Monday because ol the
iinpcn I.iik e of the finding.
Benowilz and colleague Dr. Christine A.
I laller noted that most of the cases lhe\ studied
involved healtln voting people. Some had been
taking ephedra for just davs or weeks, and two
women who became pregnant while taking it
lost i heir babies.
Kphedra (pronounced eh-KKD-ruh) procl
ii( is are often sold in health food stores under
such names .is Ripped Kucl — used bv bodv
builders hoping to inc t ease muscle and energ\
as well as Metabolile and Diet-lMien for di
eters. I bet e are hundreds of unregulated
ephedra produc is on the market.
Benowilz estimated 12 million people in the
I niied Slates used ephedra products last vear.

Josv ph Kevin, director of FDA's lood salety
center, said the agency will decide by the end of
the year whether to impose restrictions on
ephedra or commission further research.
Also Monday, the FDA warned Americans
not to use over-the-counter cold remedies or
appetite suppressants with an ingredient c alled
phenylpropanolamine, or IMW, because it can
c ause strokes. I he FDA said it is taking steps to
ban IM'A, which is a chemical cousin oft he types
ol ephedra the (California researchers studied.
In the study released Monday, the te
searc bet s reviewed records from 140 ephedra
users who suffered complications in 1007
through 1000, finding about one-third of the
pre>hlems definitely or probably were caused by
the ephedra and another one-third possibly
were c aused by it.
In one-lift It of the cases, there was insuffi
cient information to draw conclusions, and the
rest were deemed unrelated to ephedra use.
John I lathcock of the (Council lor Responsi
ble Nutrition, a trade group lor supplement
makers, ciHicizecl the criteria used to classify
which complications were probably caused bv
ephedra, lie also said a soon-to-be-published
studs bv other researchers found no link be
tween sue h complications and ephedra use.
1 )r. Steven Karch, an expert working for the
Kphedra Kclucation Counc il, a group funded
In supplement makers, said in some of the
cases studied, he believes pre-existing health
problems su< li as heart disease caused the com
plications.
Dr. Stephen Sc hneider, an endoc rinologist
and nutrition expert at I 'niversily of Medicine
and Dentistry of New Jersey, said the study

provides strong evidence ephedra caused the
side ellects in many of the patients, but not
enough evidence to ban it.
He said some ol the patients had medical
conditions, were taking other medicines or
were drinking caffeine I licit could heighten
ephedra's ellects.
"Many people have no idea that they're tak
ing it," because the label is often incomplete or
misleading, Schneider said. Also, past research
has shown that the dosage in ephedra pills
often varies widely from what is on the label.
Schneider and Benowilz stressed that
ephedra should not be taken by anyone who is
pregnant or has a history of heart disease,
stroke, psychiatric disorders, asthma, thyroid
or kidney disease, diabetes or seizures.
Benowilz and I laller said federal regulators
should require health warnings on products
containing ephedra and should resurrect a
proposal to impose dose limits. That idea was
sc rapped in 1007 under pressure from the in
dustry. At the lime, the FDA had 800 reports of
side ellec ts, including 44 deaths; the number
lias since risen.
The FDA asked Benowilz and I laller, an
other team ol outside experts, and two in
house panels of scientists to evaluate the latest
batch of cases where ephedra users suffered
heart palpitations, very high blood pressure,
heart attacks, strokes, seizures or other compli
cations. The study by Benowilz and I laller is
ihc first to appear in a medical journal.
The FDA's Kevitt said the four research
groups had similar findings, though in some
cases they did not agree on whether ephedra
was to blame.
