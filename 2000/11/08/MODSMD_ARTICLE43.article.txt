# Study links Parkinson's to pesticide

### 
(AP) — New research using rals suggests
that long-term exposure lo a widely used
pesticide kills Inain cells and triggers debil
itating physical symptoms associated with
Parkinson's disease.
Scientists sav the experiment's results
strongly indicate what scientists have sus
pected lor several years — that the most
common lorm ol Parkinson's disease might
result Iroin toxins in the environment.
I he new study, published in the Decem
ber issue ol Nature Neuroscience, does not
prove that the pesticide used in the lest,
rotenone, causes Parkinson's in humans.
Hut scientists who reviewed the experi
ment said the results are powerful and
should rcinvigorate the seal < li for environ
mental toxins that may contribute to
Parkinson's, the most common neurologi
cal disorder after Alzheimer's.
" I his is more evidence that a class ol
compounds may increase the risk of devel
oping Parkinson's," said |. William
Langston, director of the Parkinson's Insti
tute in Sunnyvale, Calif., who was not-in
volved in the study, "li is not direct evi
dence thai rotenone causes Parkinson's.
1 lie whole puzzle hasn't come together."
More than 1 million Americans suffer
from Parkinson's.
Muscle control ebbs .is brain cells in a re
gion called the substantia nigra produce
less dopamine, a hormone vital to normal
nerve function. I lie illness is marked by
small tremors, such as facial tics and shak
ing hands. Advanced symptoms include a
shuffling gait, speech difficulties and mus
cle weakness.

1 here is no cure, and current drug and
surgical therapies tends to lose effectiveness
over time. New therapies involving trans
plants of stem cells, the body's master cells
from which all tissues grow, have been
slowed by federal funding restrictions on
experiments using embryonic tissues.
In about 10 percent of patients, Parkin
son's strikes before age f>(). I hese rare cases
probably are caused by inherited genetic
abnormalities.
However, most patients show their first
Parkinson's symptoms alter age (>(). Re
searchers believe older patients may have
suffered brain damage from chronic expo
sure to unspecified toxins. Among the sus
pects: pesticides, industrial chemicals and
tobacco smoke.
In the experiment conducted at Kmory
I niversil) in Atlanta, neurologists impl;lilt
ed tiny pumps in the nils lo continuously
administer low doses ol rotenone through
the jugular vein for as long .is live weeks.
Rotenone is an organic product made
from extrat is of tropical plants, li is widely
used as an agricultural pesticide and lo kill
unwanted fish in reservoirs.
People most frequent 1) would be ex
posed to rotenone b\ ingesting residue in
food or In handling the compound.
Scientists acknowledged the pump
method used in the experiment did not du
plicate rotenone exposure in the real
world, but said it was a more direct and re
liable method for research purposes.
"Rats can be picky about what they eat
and they might not like eating rotenone,"
said |. I imotliv (Ireetlaim re, the study's se

nior author. "Whether the pesticide would
have rlie same elfect in people via normal
routes of exposure is not clear."
Greenamyre said half of the rats gradu
ally showed Parkinson s s.\ mptoms.
Examination revealed that large num
bers of dopamine-pt oducing cells in the
rats' brains had died or were damaged. In
addition, the cells showed fibrous protein
deposits that closeh resemble Lew\ bodies,
deposits found in brain cells ol Parkinson's
patients.
"Together, it's what you set- in Parkin
son's," (ireenann re said.
How rotenone might have triggered
these changes in rat is unclear. I niversit\
of Pennsylvania researchers Benoit I. Ciias
son and Virginia M.-Y. Lee, who reviewed
the Kmory experiment, suggest the pesti
cide might target the mitochondria, a ge
netic bundle tli.u generates most of a cell's
energy.
Such damage unleashes rogue molecules
known as free radicals that wreak havoc in
cells, free radicals have been implicated in
many degenerative diseases.
"Neurons are particularly sensitive," (ii
asson and Lee noted.
Greenamyre said future rotenone ex
periments with i;its would tesi new drugs
aimed at protecting dopamine-producing
cells.
In the meantime, he suggested that farm
ers and public health agetu ies reconsider pes
ticide usage.
"Pesticides are essential lor growing crops,
but we may need to think about minimizing
their environmental impact," lie said.
