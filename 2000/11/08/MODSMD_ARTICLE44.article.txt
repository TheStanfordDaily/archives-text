# Confessions of a lone engineer
## 
### ALAN LEE 
I am «m engineer. No. thai doesn't au
tomaticalh mean that I am clinically in
sane or enjo\ pain and suffering. And
contrary i<> popular opinion, we engi
neers don't all belong in 12-step pro
grams to 1 enoiini e oin wrongful wax s.
I know tli.il some ol mv friends have
questioned m\ s,mii\ (I »\ 'questioned,' I
mean repeaicdh taunted and laughed
at), l)iu I think, we engineers have an
honest appreciation lot thebeauiN ol the
world given In the laws ol physics.
I know what you're thinking: Is this
jllsi another nutcase who lias spent one
hour too manv in lennan Kngineering
pondering the great fundamental postu
lates of quantum mei hanics? I lie answer
to ih.it is .t definitive mavbe, hut that's
not the point. I lie point is that, even
though a lot ol people equate .1 life* mar
ried to | >Ii\ si< s as a painful and agonizing
experience surpassed only by a"l ull
House' marathon, being an engineer
somehow brings us < loser to the meaning
of life.
What kind ol lile? I'll admit college is
certainh no pit ni< lor a hard-tore sci
ence major. Having to lake physics,
chemisirv, math and anvthing else the
I niversit) wants to hurl at you at the
same lime is like getting hit l>\ ,i steaming
locomotive ... twice.
In fact, most engineers would have
preferred ihe train at some point. Hut,
with perseverance and lots and lois of
caffeine, we manage to gel through the
mass confusion and appreciate the world
on another level.
1 spent m\ first two years ol college liv
ing in a diisi\ corner of the librar\. com
ing out ol the woodwork onl\ lo scare lit
tle children and pa\ taxes. I iliink we've
all been through thai phase where every
thing inc hiding eating, sleeping and h\-

giene becomes a distant priority next to
our mad desire to avoid grades thai
should be reserved lor a being with the
intellectual level of defunct bread mold.
M\ own h\giene during my freshmen
year was not exactly irreproachable,
prompting mv dorm lo upgrade the
phrase "bad hair day" lo "()h dear (iod,
what is that?! hair day. Bui a tousled ap
pearance and mind-boggling rejection
bv ihe opposite sex is sureh a small prit e
to pav lor ihe secrets ol life.
When I gel together with a bunch of
my physics friends, the conversation in
variablv ends up revolving around some
aspect ol ihe golden rule ol harmonic
transitions. It's not because we don'i
have lives, though that may be a fortu
itous coincidence, but because science
genuinch interests us.
Sure there are other things lo talk
about, like cars, spoils 01 why I was
lound lace-down in the middle ol Ma\-

drunken stupor belching out Italian
songs I didn't know I knew, hut these

well versed in lileraiure, poeiry and pol

much until the fdurili 01 lilth shot ol
vodka.
Some people gel annoyed when we
engineers gel too technical about ex
plaining evervdax things like the color ol
a sunset or \vli\ Mike was heller oil he
lore he stuck the fork into ihe out lei.
Manv people claim thai explaining a
thing of hcaut\ robs ii ol iis nivstery.
I hose people obvioush never under
siood quantum mechanics because, il

would immediately vanish in a puff ol

only a handful ol people in the world
truly get to the point where they can un
derstand quantum mechanics. 1 lie rest
of us are simply shocked and amazed by
it and iherelore lorgothe painful process
ol spontaneously disassembling.
Appreciating science c hanges a per
son's mindset. lake, lor example, look
ing al something as simple as a rock.
When I look at a rock, I am amazed by
two things. The first is thai I am so easily
entertained. I lie other, more important
thing, is ihe stunning arrangement of
atomic planes complete with crystallo
graphy point group and characteristic
symmetry coupled with bonding
arrangements and an elec iron cloud dis
tribution that would make your head
swim.

our mad desire to avoid grades thai
should be reserved lor a being with the
intellectual level of defunct bread mold.
M\ own h\giene during my freshmen
year was not exactly irreproachable,
prompting mv dorm lo upgrade the
phrase "bad hair day" lo "()h dear (iod,
what is that?! hair day. Bui a tousled ap
pearance and mind-boggling rejection

to pav lor ihe secrets ol life.
When I gel together with a bunch of
my physics friends, the conversation in
variablv ends up revolving around some
aspect ol ihe golden rule ol harmonic
transitions. It's not because we don'i
have lives, though that may be a fortu
itous coincidence, but because science
genuinch interests us.
Sure there are other things lo talk
about, like cars, spoils 01 why I was
lound lace-down in the middle ol Ma\-
lielcl slice! lasi Saturday night in a
drunken stupor belching out Italian
songs I didn't know I knew, hut these
iliings jllsi siniplv clon'l compare to ihe
mathematical brilliance of an eigenfuiK -

much until the fdurili 01 lilth shot ol

Some people gel annoyed when we
engineers gel too technical about ex
plaining evervdax things like the color ol
a sunset or \vli\ Mike was heller oil he
lore he stuck the fork into ihe out lei.
Manv people claim thai explaining a

I hose people obvioush never under

would immediately vanish in a puff ol
smoke.
fortunatel) lor human procreation,
only a handful ol people in the world
truly get to the point where they can un
derstand quantum mechanics. 1 lie rest
of us are simply shocked and amazed by
it and iherelore lorgothe painful process
ol spontaneously disassembling.
Appreciating science c hanges a per
son's mindset. lake, lor example, look
ing al something as simple as a rock.
When I look at a rock, I am amazed by
two things. The first is thai I am so easily
entertained. I lie other, more important
thing, is ihe stunning arrangement of
atomic planes complete with crystallo
graphy point group and characteristic
symmetry coupled with bonding
arrangements and an elec iron cloud dis
tribution that would make your head
swim.
I know I'm not the onl\ one. I here
are people in the plnsics building who
spend their entire day silling al I heir
desk and thinking, because ihe\ truly

pondering ihe complexities ol the uni

fused to move.
Manx of us couldn't imagine not being
engineers or scientists. I'hvsics and math
Iu si bee on ies a part of life, like breathing,
eating and Kr\ s employees who seem lo
function heller as doorstops than ac tual
salespeople, for me, al least, the beauty
ol the world becomes much more appar
