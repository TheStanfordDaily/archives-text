Club drugs are attractive lo today's
youth because iliev are inexpensive and
genet ale increased stamina and intoxicat
ing highs. In addition, many people be
lieve that the side elle< is of club drugs are
minimal. St ientili< research proves other
wise.
Research b\ the National Institute on
Drug Abuse has shown that use of dub
drugs can cause serious health problems
and even death.
"We ma\ be seeing a public health epi
demic on the hori/on, and we need to get
in ilic path o! this plague and slop 11 short
in iis path," s.iid Alan Leslmer, Ph.D., di
recior ol the institute.
( Iul) drugs can cause a wide range of
ellects, nit hiding hallucinations, paranoia
and amnesia. I hcv .ilso have some serious
long-term implications.

I sed in < ombination with alcohol, < lub
drills arc even more lethal. Some <lul>
drugs work on the same brain mecha
nisms as alcohol and can therefore intcn
sil\ the ellectsol both stihslanccs.
In addition, because some clnb dings
are colorless, odorless and tasteless, thc\
have been linked to cases ol sexual assault
«md are known as "dale rape drugs."
Some ol the most connnonh used club
drugs are inetlivlenedioxymethampheta
mine or MI)\IA; gannna-hvdroxvbu
t\ rate or (>ll B; and Rohypnol.
MDMA, known as Kcstasv, X. Adam

.iihl X I (1, is used as <i stimulant and
sought alter lor its psu hedelic cHeds. Kn
abling people to dam e lor long periods, it
is also responsible lor dehydration. h\ per
tension and even heart or kidney failure.
I sually, MDMA is in the lot in of a tablet
01 capsule. Itselle< is last about tluee to six
hours, bin confusion, depression, sleep
problems, anxict\ and paranoia have
been reported to occur weeks alter the
drug is used. Research indicates that the
chronic use ol MDMA damages the brain
cells that produce serotonin, a natural
chemical thai is partly responsible lor
lnetnon and mood. I lie regeneration
rate ol these cells is unknown, so it is pos

sible that the memory loss and other dam
age niav be long-lasting or permanent.
(.1 lb, also known as Liquid Ecstasy, (i,
(ieorgia llonie Boy and Citicvous BodiK
Harm, can be Ibutid in cleat liquid, pow
der, tablet and capsule tonus. Cillß has
been increasingly involved in poisonings,
overdoses, date rapes and deaths. ()lten, it
is taken with alcohol, making it even more
dangerous. However, unlike MDMA,
CiHB is a depressant that can relax the
both. I )ependingon the dosage, the ellects
of CIHB begin to appeal within 10 to 20
minutes and last up to lour hours. As the
dosage increases, the sedative ellects m;i\
result in sleep and eventual comaoi death.
Rohypnol, also called roolies, rophies,
roc lie and lorget-me pill, is usuall) taken
orally. At times, it is also ground up and
snorted. Rohypnol is tasteless, odorless
and can be dissolved easily in drinks. In
lact, its sedative and toxic elleds are
heightened with alcohol use. Yet, even
when taken without alcohol, a dose ol Ro
hypnol as small as one milligram can im
pair a victim lot eight to 12 hours. In ad
<l it ion, Rohypnol can cause "anterograde"
amnesia, a condition in whic li people c an
lot get what had occurred when they were
under the drug's influence. Consequent
ly, Rohypnol is tied to instances ol sexual
assault.
()ther popular c lub drugs include ket
atnine, LSI) (lysergic acid diethylamide)
and methamphetamine. ketamine,
dubbed "Special K" or "k," is an anesthet
ic. Small amounts ol'ketamine lead to loss

ol attention span, learning ability and
memory. Larger doses can cause deliri
um, amnesia, high blood pressure, de
pression and severe breathing problems.
Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or
Acid may produce erratic behavior de
pending on ihe dosage and on the user's
personality. A user might leel numbness,
weakness, nausea, increased heart rate,
sweating, lack of appetite, "flashbacks" and
sleeplessness. Methamphetamine, also
known as speed, ice, chalk, or metli, can re
sult in memory loss, aggression, violence,
psychotic behavior and heart problems.
(Kerdoses of club drugs are dillicult to
diagnose. I lie victim may be hallucinating
or unconscious. They may have malig
nant hyperthermia, strong convulsions
.ind .1 temperature as high as 107 degrees.
I he best course of action to take in inci
dents like this is to put I he victim in a quiet
place and call 91 I immediately. The goal
is to keep the victim as sale and calm as
possible before professional medical at
tention can be accessed.
In order to protect themselves from
date rape drugs, partygoers should not
drink beverages at dubs or parties unless
the) have opened the beverage container
themselves and have not let the drink out
of their sight. I o learn more about dub
