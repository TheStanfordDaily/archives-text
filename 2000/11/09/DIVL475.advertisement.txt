Lecture, Discussion & Book Signing
Friday, November 10, 2000
12 Noon
History Bldg 200, Room 205
June Jordan has been described as "our Premiere Black woman essayist" by Noble
Laureate Toni Morrison, and is the founder of the renowned "Poetry for the People"
program at U.C. Berkeley. Soldier: A Poet's Childhood is her newest book. It has been
described as "a remarkably touching narrative" poured out in "uncompromising, poetic
prose" (Black Issues Book Review, Sept/Oct 2000). The book focuses on her father, a
Jamaican immigrant: "Capricious and didactic, Jordan's martinet dad is the most intriguing
and tyrannical person in this book" (Village Voice, June 13, 2000). Professor Jordan will
read from and sign copies of this book as well as others. (Copies will be available for sale
outside room 205.)
