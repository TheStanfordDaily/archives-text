THE VIRTUE
I
Making money, we are told, is morally despicable and the root of all evil. Businesses must
sacrifice their profits to the environment, animals, and the needy. Executive salaries should
be capped and companies should have a multicultural board of directors. Downsizing is
cruel. Mergers, takeovers, and restructuring are heartless. Businessmen are described in
college classrooms, the press, and Hollywood as monopolistic pillagers who must be regu
lated by an omnipotent bureaucrat.
But, in fact, a wealth-creator is morally admirable because he is a thinker, a producer, and
a trader. The creation of financial services, a tract of homes, or a communications network
requires moral virtue. A rational businessman does not work to please the needs of the
community. He wants to see his work completed his way. He is driven by the sheer
pleasure of personal success - with profit as a key indicator of that success.
A businessman should be proud to say: "I make money.' But to earn such pride, he must
live by Ayn Rands ethics of rational selfishness. To defend an inviolate right to work for
his own profit - to protect himself from envious competitors and power-lusting bureau
crats - a businessman must reject the vicious notion that living for others is a virtue. He
needs to learn the moral meaning of the Declaration of Independence.
