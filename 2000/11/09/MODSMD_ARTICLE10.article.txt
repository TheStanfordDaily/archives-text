Kidnappings cause police
to issue warning
SAN JOSE, Calif (AP) — Two attempted kidnap
pings in two days prompted police to issue a warning to
parents and children.
Police say they are not sure if the cases are related,
hut victims in both cases gave similar descriptions of the
men and the car they drove.
T he first attempt happened Monday afternoon, as
an 18-year-old woman walked to a bus slop. Two men
tried to pull her into a passing van, but she was able to
escape.
The second attempt happened Tuesday morning as
two 12-year-old girls walked to school. The van pulled
up next to them and a passenger offered them a ride, a
puppy and then candy. The girls said no, then the man
got out ol the van and grabbed one girl's backpack. She
freed herself and both girls ran away, police said.

Mendocino County
becomes first in nation to
OK growing pot
L KIAf 1, Calif. (AP) — Voters in Mendoc ino County
decided it's high time to partially decriminalize their
most valuable cash crop — marijuana — in the first
such ballot measure in the nation.
Measure C allows residents of this verdant county on
(California's north coast to cultivate up to 2fi pot plants
apiece. The initiative faced no organized opposition
and passed Tuesday with 5H percent of the vote.
While a handful of liberal college towns such as
Berkeley, Ann Arbor, Mich., and Amherst, Mass., have
decriminalized smoking marijuana, Mendocino be
comes the first community to sanction growing pot. Ac -
cording to the National ()rganization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws.
But is the grass really greener the other side of Elec
tion Day?
Measure C doesn't mean marijuana is complete!)
legal here now — state and federal drug laws still apply,
as well as the limitation to 25 plants. The perception
that locals can grow with impugnity simply is not true.

Maryland tuition policy is
struck down by state's
highest court
Maryland's highest court on Monday struck down a
state-university-system policy that precludes students
from being considered as residents for tuition purposes
if most of their financial support comes from outside of
the state.
The state court of appeals ruled that the University
System of Maryland's policy "arbitrarily and irrationally
discriminates" against students who live in the state and
would qualify as state residents if they did not financial
ly depend on someone who lives elsewhere.
The court's decision, rendered unanimously by a
seven-judge panel, invalidated the policy as violating
the Maryland (Constitution's equal-protection guaran
tees. The court did not tackle the question of whether
the policy violated the U.S. (Constitution's equal-protec
tion clause, but parenthetic ally conveyed the view that it
may.
