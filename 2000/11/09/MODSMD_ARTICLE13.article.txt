1973
On November 9, 1973, The Daily ran an
article titled, "Women (lonsider Auto Me
chanics Cbourse A (ias."
" You can do a lot il" you're willing to gel
your hands dirty,' Steve I iogel tells his auto
mechanics class. About 2. r > students, mostly
women, show up in the Women s (-lub
house each tuesday night lot the YWCA
sponsored class.
"Although there is little talk ol'liberation,
women in tlie class reject the idea that auto
mechanics is unlady like. 1 hey are tired of
being helpless in the face of simple mechan
ical problems.
"... For most class members, auto me
chanics is a new interest. 'People bring next
to nothing in terms ol knowledge,' 1 logel
says. 'Some people have never opened the
hood of their car; they don't know what the
battery is.' "
Bottom line: Next article: Men consider cooking
class a piece of cake.
