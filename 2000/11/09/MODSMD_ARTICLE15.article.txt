## Violence flares as Arafat heads to Washington 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Violence
flared in the West Bank antl Gaza
Strip on yesterday even as Pales
tinian leader Yasser Arafat headed
for Washington to consult with
President Clinton. Palestinian
gunmen killed a customs worker
on her way to work, and four Pales
tinians were shot dead in clashes.
The Palestinian leader Hew to
Cairo to meet with Egyptian Presi
dent Hosni Mubarak — the main
sponsor, with Clinton, of the peace
process — and then headed to
London to meet with British Prime
Minister Tony Blair.
Arafat was due in Washington
by nightfall, and will meet v\iih
Clinton today. Israeli Prime Minis
ter Ehud Barak was to meet with
(Minion on Sunday.
Barak said on Israeli television
that he will not ask for resumption
of peace negotiations. "I go to
Washington lo ensure thai the end
of violence that was agreed on at
Sharm el-Sheikh is carried out if
that is possible. That is all," he said,
referring to a truce mediated last
month by Clinton in Egypt.
Although the Palestinians have
said they won't declare statehood
on Nov. 15 — the 12th anniversary
of a symbolic independence decla
ration Arafat made in exile — they
did say they might do so without
prior notice.
"The Palestinian people have
the right to declare the state* when
ever they want," Nabil Shaath, a
top aide to Arafat, said yesterday.
That came a day after Barak

made his clearest ever offer of
statehood to the Palestinians, but
said it could come only through
negotiations — and that talks
would resume only once the vio
lence stopped.
"This situation cannot continue
and Israel will put an end to it, be it
by political or other ways," Barak
said Yesterday at a memorial to
former Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, slain by a Jewish extremist
five years ago.
"Violence will not achieve any
thing, it will not change our policy
and will not weaken our determi
nation to bring peace and security
to Israel."
But the prospect of a peaceful res
olution seemed lar away yesterday.
I hree Palestinian gunmen am
bushed an Israeli customs official
traveling to work in Rafali, the Is
raeli-controlled border crossing
between the Gaza Strip and Egypt,
l liey killed her and injured her
nephew, who was driving.
Barak said he viewed the attack
"with great severity, especially on
the eve of. . . Arafat's trip to Wash
ington. It calls into question the se
riousness of Arafat's intentions to
implement. .. understandings and
decrease violence in the region."
A group allied with the militant
Islamic Jihad, a small organization
opposed to the peace process,
claimed responsibility for the at
tack in a statement faxed to The
Associated Press in Damascus,
Syria.
In retaliation, Israel shut clown

the crossing and Gaza's airport,
which it jointly controls with the
Palestinians.
Officials said they believed the
gunmen came fiom the direction
of i he airfield. Israeli army Chief of
Staff Shaul Mofaz lias accused
Arafat of smuggling arms on his
presidential jet. Hussein a-Sheikh,
a senior military aide to Arafat, dis
missed that c harge as "nonsense."
Four Palestinians — including
three teen-agers — were killed in
clashes with Israelis throughout the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip on yes
terday. Two more teen-agers died
overnight from wounds sustained in
earlier clashes, bringing the death
total from five weeks of violence to
17S— lt). r )of those Palestinians.
The killing of minors has 112 ueled
Palestinian fury, and Arafat wants
Clinton to press Barak to accept an
international monitoring force.
"If (( linton) thinks Israel would
not accept, then he should work to
put pressure on Israel to accept it,"
Shaath said.
Israelis sav the) will reject any
attempt to bring in polite from the
outside, but Barak has said he is
ready to accept the scrutiny of a
committee convened by Clinton
and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan that will examine the caus
es of the violence.
The committee will be led by
former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell,
who guided peace talks in North
ern Ireland, and will include an
other American, a Turk, a Norwe
gian and a Spaniard.

Shaath said Arafat was insisting
the committee include an African
— preferably Nelson Mandela of
South Africa, a friend to the Pales
tinian cause who nonetheless sur
prised Israelis last year on his fust

visit when he emphasized his un
derstanding for Israeli positions.
Shaath said the Palestinian;
want to broaden international me
diation to diminish the I'.S. role
which they view as overwhelming

ly pro-Israel.
"\\'e want a united European
role that supports our demands
and our rights," lit' said. "This is
what can bring peace to the area
and to Israel."
