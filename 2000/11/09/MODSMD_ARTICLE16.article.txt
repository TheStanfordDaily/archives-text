MOSCOW (AP) — Crew members aboard a crippled nu
clear submarine struggled against deadly carbon monoxide
gas from a lire but leared they could not survive an attempt to
reach the surface, one sailor wrote in the second note from the
Kursk to be made public.
"We feel bad . . . we're weakened by the elfects of carbon
monoxide from the fire . . . the pressure is in< leasing in the
compartment . . . if we head for the surface we won't survive
the compression," Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanovread
from the note on OR 1 government television yesterday.
"We can't last more titan a day,"the note concluded, Kle
banov said.
The note was found in the clothes of an unidentified sub
mariner after his body was pulled from the vessel bv deep-sea
divers, said Klebanov, who read parts of the message after a
meeting of the government commission investigating the Aug.
12 disaster.
The note was written around 1 p.m. that day, Klebanov
said, about an hour and a half after the submarine was torn
apart by explosions and sank to the bottom of the Barents Sea.

All 1 1«S aboard eventually died. Officials say most died imme
diately after the explosion.
Klebanov said he could not read the whole note, but would
give the "sense" of it. 1 le then read from a piece of paper and
appeal ed to give at least some of the contents word for word.
1 he note itself was not shown.
Like a message found earlier on the body of another sailor,
the note said 23 survivors of the initial explosions had gath
ered tn the 9th compartment, toward the rear of the vessel.
I he other note, written by Lt. Dmitry Kolesnikov, said sailors
crowded into the pitch-black compartment after explosions in
the submarine's nose sent it to the bottom of the sea.
Kolesnikov's family said that the death certificate they were
given by the government listed the cause of death as carbon
monoxide poisoning. The highly toxic gas is produced by
combustion of carbon-containing materials such as charcoal,
oil, or gasoline without enough oxygen present.
Klebanov didn't discuss the carbon monoxide issue.
I le said the note contained technical information, about "the
straps on the individual devices," but didn't say what devices.
