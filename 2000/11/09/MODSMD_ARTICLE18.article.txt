## 
### 
CAIRO, Egypt (Al') — Security forces fired tear
gas at voters protesting police cordons around
polling stations and supporters of rival candidates ex
changed gunfire yesterday in the final stage of
Egypt's parliamentary elections. One man w;is killed
and dozens were wounded.
Large crowds of voters waited lot hours in the sun
at polling stations in Cairo and Ciza, where candi
dates backed by the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood
were expected to score high. Police ringed the sta
tions and allowed only a trickle of voters to cast their
ballots.
A clash between supporters of the ruling National
Democratic Party and an independent candidate in
Zaghlula village, about 13 miles south of* Cairo, killed
one opposition supporter and injured four other
people, police said. Several men were arrested.
Violence among rival factions and the security
forces in the first two rounds of Egypt's three-stage
elections left five people dead and dozens wounded.
Yesterday's voting took place in nine provinces,
including the capital, Cairo, and the central Assiut
province, with 160 seats at stake. Results were ex
pected Thursday and runoffs will be held where no
candidate received more than 50 percent of the vote.
The outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, which t ails
for turning Egypt into an Islamic state, has been the
government's most tenacious opponent in the el< < -
tions. Unable to field its own candidates, it endorses
nominally independent candidates.
Voting was generally smooth in areas where no

Brotherhood candidates were running. Brother
hood-backed candidates won 15 seats — more than
ail the other opposition parties combined — in the
earlier stages of the polls which began ()ct. 1 <S.
In Shoubra cl-khema, north ol ('.airo, demonstra
tors who had been waiting for hours began chanting
the name of an independent candidate who is not
linked to the brotherhood.
Police fired tear gas and.">(> people were treated in
hospital with breathing problems, ambulance officials
said.
In Hawamdeya, south of Cairo, and in the Nile
Delta town of Basons, voters fed up with the delays
hurled stones at the police blocking the way to the
polling stations.
Many voters complained th.it plainclothes polit e
man tried to pressure them into revealing who thc\
would vote for and would let in only those voting for
the President Hosni Mubarak's National Democratic
Party.
The Brotherhood charged the government with
arresting and beating up stores of its supporters yes
terday. It said bearded male voters or women wear
ing headscarves, both signs of religious conservatism,
tended to be harassed and ail i sted.
The police denied the t barges and blamed the op
position for the violence.
So lilt in the elections, the National Democratic
Parly has won 221 seats, legal opposition parlies
have taken 10 scats and independents have gained
33.
