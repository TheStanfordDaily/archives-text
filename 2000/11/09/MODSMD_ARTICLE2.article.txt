### WILL OREMUS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Palo Alio Mayor Li/. Kniss is lead
ing Dolores (l)ollv) Sandoval by
2,000 votes in a tight race for the
Stanford-area seat on I lie Santa
(llara (lountv Board of Supen isors.
With 8,000 to 10,000 absentee
ballots yet i<> l)e counted, Kniss has
garnered 47,894 votes, or 51 per
cent, to Sandoval's 45,951 votes, or
19 percent.
The Santa Clara County Elec
tions Department will open the bal
lots and count them on Friday.
Kniss aniticipates they will also an
nounce the winner on Friday.
Kniss said it was "statistically like
ly" that she would win but that she
would refrain from declaring victo
ry until all the votes are counted.
Fhe winner will assume the seat
that represents the sth District, the
county's northernmost. The district
covers Palo Alto, Los Altos, Moun
tain View <ind Cupertino in addi
tion to portions of other cities and a
large unincorporated area that in

cludes Stanford.
Both candidates expressed sup
port for Simitian's controversial
land use plan for Stanford. San
doval's campaign Web site claimed
that she would take a harder line
than Kniss. Sandoval hoped to el
led the Palo Alto (lity (council's pro
posal lor permanently-dedicated
open space in the Stanford-owned
Foothills.
Fhe close race echoed the split in
support from local leaders lor the
two c andidates. Current sth District
Supervisor Joe Simitian, Rep. Anna
Eshoo and Hewlett Packard (TO
Carh Fiorina, among others, en
dorsed Kniss. Sandoval's support
c ame from San Jose leaders such as
mayor Ron Con/ales, environmen
tal and labor groups and several
current members oft he Santa (llara
Board of Supervisors.
Neither candidate conveyed a
message that departed sharply from
Simitian's moderate agenda. Both
said that they were strong propo
nents of Measure A to hind in
creased mass transit.
Sandoval's VVeh site alleged that
Kniss often did not act quickly or de
cisively enough as a City Council
member. Kniss responded by point
ing to Sandoval's lack of political ex
f>erience.
Kniss, 61, has 15 years of experi
ence as an elected official, including
four years on the school board of the
Palo Alto Unified Schcx)l District
and 10 years on the Palo Alto City
Council.
The 39-year-old Sandoval, a
high school math teacher, is a mem

ber of the Foothill-DeAnza Com
munity College Board of Trustees.
She has served on the board for
nine years.
Kniss won a plurality in a March
primary, but Sandoval's 34 percent
forced the Tuesday runoff. Candi
dates needed a majority of votes in
the primary to avoid the runoff.
Both candidates in the non
partisan race identified them
selves as Democrats. Sandoval an
gered the Kniss campaign when
she categorized her opponent as a
"Democratic Activist" in an Octo
ber flyer distributed to Republi
can voters.
Kniss subsequently came under
fire for misrepresenting the ruling
of the (k>unty Board of Ethics on
Sandoval's fiver.
