### TIANA MURILLO GUEST COLUMNIST 
Wl IA I MY (JKANI)FATI IKK tasted as a Bracero
during WW 1 1 was the prospect of economic and
sot i.il mobility, something that was not available
to him in his native Mexico. With <1 pic kup truck,
his wile and six c hildren, lie obtained .1 passport and look his
family to .1 countrv v\ here he knew he would be able to liud
someplace th.it would p.iv him I01 hard work.
M\ family < ertainh got paid lot their toil, but nowhere in
the Anient .111 I )reani was the promise ol a living wage. With
lour ol the eight-member dan slaving away in grape vine
yards (among oilier crops) Ibr 12 hours a day lot weeks on
end, they barely earned enough to be able 10 afford ( oca
(Colas to wash down their lunches. For a longtime, iliev lived
out ol the back ol the pickup true k, and bitterly cold irriga
tion c anals doubled as plac es lor iheni lo bathe.
Not only did my grandfather oiler his hands, body and
work ethic to leeel his family, he also made the ultimate sac
rifice: his lift*. In ID92. inv grandfather's lungs, black with
cancel, < lioked away his lasi breath. I le did not smoke lor
one day ol his lilt.*, and doc tors speculated that peslic ide in
halation was to blame lot his demise.
1 his story should not lool anybody into believing thai 1 he
grapes boycott is important lo me only because ol my own
family's history. I his experienc c still continues to be played
out in the lives of a disproportionate number of 'extremely
hardworking people who do backbreaking work that lew
others would willingly perform. II you don't believe me,
t.ike a trip clown to Watsonville.
So why is the boycott only targeted at grapes? Because
boycotts are always the last resort lor labor actions ol this
kind, and grapes 1 email 1 the only fruit that we've been asked
to boycott by the I FW. 1 he United Farm Workers, started
by ( les.tr ('.have/, is the entity that has made the most gain in
protec ting workers' basic human rights (e.g. the right lo not
breathe c ancer-causing chemic als). I hrough the I I W, the
grape workers risked their jobs and called a boycott 011
grapes to obtain worker justice. Conditions in the grape
fields remain unchanged and bad enough to warrant a con
tinued boycott. By voting not to serve grapes in the dining
halls, we are offering support to the grape workers.
In the greater context, the grapes boycott remains a state
ment ou the conditions that larin laborers ol all c rops con
tinue to face. Just because a boycott hasn't been called Ibr
those does not mean that laborers are treated any better.
I licit c contribution in keeping one of California's most pros
perous industries alive is recognized by meager wages, as
well as .1 predisposition to myriad health problems from
dangerous working conditions and backbreaking stoop
labor.
It is incumbent upon us as thinking, feeling individuals to
recognize the importance of life and dignity. The grapes
boycott is mistakenly believed to be a "Mexican issue." Kvery
single one ol you, regardless ol which state you c ame from,
will be spending some amount of time in (California.
I lie beautiful fruit and produce platters that Stern pre
sents lor your dining pleasure are, quite literally , the fruits
of the labor of families like mine. If you've ever marveled at
(California's bewildering fruit selection — and how it is avail
able- year-round — then you have benefited from a person
working for $5.7f> an hour, being exposed to more pesticide
111 a week than you 01 I might encounter in a lifetime.
I do not ask you to support the grapes boycott out of a hid
den agenda to deprive you of your freedom to eat grapes. 1
do believe, however, that your quality of life will not be com
promised by showing that you support human dignity.
