### GARY CALOROSO GUEST COLUMNIST 
SFANF( )RI) STUDEN'I S SI IOULD understand the
lads behind the 16-year-old boycott: of grapes. 1 he
boycott is not credible. It does not deserve your sup
port. (lonsider the following:
l itis boycott started before most current Stanford stu
dents began elementary school. Please read the 1984
UFW boycott resolution on Stanford's Grapes Education
Web site. It is a resolution stemming mostly from then
current politics and makes no mention of pesticides or
food safety.
I he boycott seeks to protect the interest of one single
union. I FW, rather than farm workers. That union is the
only one that started the boycott and they are the only one
that can < all it oil.
I he UFW does not need the boycott to build mem
bet ship. (lalilornia law protects the right of farm workers
to choose which, if any, union shall be its representative.
I here are 50,000 farm workers employed in California's
grape industry. Not one table grape worker is currently rep
resented l>\ the UFW through a collective bargaining
agreement. I here are at least six unions other than the
I FYV that represent farm workers.
Fo organi/.e larin workers, anv union c an file a notice of
intent to organi/e with the stale Agricultural Labor Rela
tions Board. This will allow them access to a particular farm
for the purpose of organizing. The UFW has not filed such
a notice to gain access to a table grape vineyard in several
years.
Most farmers know that they need a satisfied work force
to be suc cessful, and they strive to provide the best possible
working conditions, compensation and benefits.
(irape growers have been leaders in developing farming
prac tices that have significantly reduced the use of pesti
cides. They have led in the development of Integrated Pest
Management. The UFW has done nothing to further this
science.
Despite the absence of references to food safety and pes
ticides in theit boycott resolution, the UFW now uses such
themes to scare the public.
No science exists to support their hyperbole; in lad sci
ence is now revealing that an ingredient in grapes, Resvera
tol. is a possible cancer-lighting agent.
Farmers provide portable sanitary toilets and washing
and drinking water facilities equal to or greater than the one
unit per 20 workers thai state law requires.
I he I T \\ has long held a basic philosophy of "rule or
ruin. Boycotts seek to ruin those who do not subject them
selves to the rule ol the boycott perpetrator.
Fable-grape workers and farmers refuse to be overrun
by a self-serving aggressor who seeks to either rule or ruin
their interests.
I he (.rape Workers and farmers Coalition supports
the rights ol workers to choose which, if any, union might
represent them through certification or decertification
elections.
We urge Stanford students to support farm workers
and farmers and reject the UFW boycott of table
grapes.
Further, we urge Stanford students to write to Presi
dent Hennessyand request that the campus no longer be
put through the annual exercise of voting whether to pun
ish a single commodity in the interest of a single union.
