# SUMMARY JUDGMENT
## Hackers, industry engaged in technology arms race 
### 
N apster may be trying to go
legit by partnering with
media conglomerate Ber
telsmann, but the future of
online music will continue to be
grounded in piracy.
The battle between the recording in
dustry and software hackers resembles a
never-ending arms race. Every time the
music or movie industry c reates technolo
gy to protect its intellectual property
rights, hackers find ways to break them.
1 he lessons from DeCSS and SDMI sug
gest that the tech arms race will thwart any
legal music distribution system created by
Napster-Bertelsmann.
De(ISS is a program that breaks DVI)
encryption, permitting copying of movies,
fhe movie industry delayed marketing
DVDs until it created an encryption
scheme to protect copyrights. The
scheme, called the Content Scramble Sys
tem. was based on 40-bit encryption, the

strongest encryption
legally exportable at the
time. The movie indus
try claimed the security
system was "hacker
proof."
In 1999, a group of
hackers called the Mas
ters of Reverse-Engi
neering proved them

wrong. Exploiting a flaw in DVD playback
software, they were able to write a utility
( ailed DeCSS that decrypted DVDs, allow
ing the average computer user to make
copies of movies.
The group of hackers claimed this was
legal software manipulation, because they
were creating a means to play DVDs on
Linux-based computers. I lie movie in
dustry never made DVD available to
Linux, which infuriated hackers so that
they focused on breaking the CSS encryp
tion. (This should be a message to media
companies: Don't piss off! he Linux users.)

The hackers also claimed that DeCSS
showed that DVD encryption was too weak
to begin with. They argued that the movie
industry should have spent less time on
lawsuits and more time on building lietter
technology to safeguard their DVD copy
rights.
Asa result of DeCSS, DVI) makers have
delayed introducing DVD-audio players
while working on a stronger encryption
scheme called CSS2. The arms race has
shifted back to the movie industrv as it
tries to build a better shield for its copy
rights. Critics have already bashed CSS2
as flawed and doomed to the same failure
as the original. Indeed, building an en
cryption system tli.it will be "hacker
proof" may be 112 utile.
I his story is repeating itself for the
music industry. The recording industry,
recognizing the enormous popularity of
MP3s, put its hopes in an encryption
scheme called the Secure Digital Music
Initiative (SDMI). SDMI was based on

four dillerent "watermarking" tec hnolo
gies that identify when a music file has
been copied or modified. I he music in
dustry was so confident that SDMI was
"hacker-proof" that it oflered a $10,(KM)
reward to anybody that could successfully
hack it.
In ()ctober, the hackers won the arms
race again. Researchers from Princeton
University, Rice University and Xerox
Palo Alto Research Center broke all lout
SDMI watermarks. This defeat ma\
make the music industry give up on cre
ating secure technology and focus on
their lawsuits against Napster, Mp3.com
and others.
In addition to the extra pounding from
lawsuits heading their way, the SI )M I fail
ure hurts Napster by hindering it from
going legit. The Napster-Bertelsmann
<leal was to create a scheme to legally and
securely distribute music using Napster's
file-sharing technology, using SDMI or
similar technology. Whatever scheme

Napster uses will likely ineet the same late
as SDMI and CSS.
Napster needs to gain some legal legiti
macy il it iN to survive the legion ol lawsuits
against it. Hit cannot —due to the inabil
ity to create a secure section system for dis
tributing music — then Bertelsmann may
pull out, leaving Napster alone to face the
ravenous recording industries' lawyers.
However, the music industry really
has no choice in going alter Napster. II
technological ellorts to protect its copy
rights don't work, then they must resort
to legal ones.
And il the only successfully means of
protecting copyright is a lawsuit, every
body loses out — except the lawyers. Be
cause it does not look like the hackers will
start losing the arms race over copyright
technology anytime soon, we are going to
be needing a lot of lawyers.
