# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## What I meant to say about the Stanford land use plan 
### DAVID ABRAMS STAFF GUEST COLUMNIST 
A tew weeks ago, as I approached
the first tee of the Stanford Golf
Course, I noticed that a television
camera crew was filming tfie
scene. Although my golf game is improving
(I shot below 110 the other day), most people
wouldn't exactly consider my new swing
newsworthy. So, when 1 was approached by
a reporter from the local Fox station, I wasn't
surprised that lie didn't want to talk about
golf. Instead, the reporter wanted to discuss
a subject familiar to pretty much everyone
around this campus: Stanford's land use.
The issue of interest was the proposal to
do away with the first hole of the course in
order to free up more land for housing. I
had vaguely heard of the golf course con
troversy at that point, but had not given it
much thought. The crux of my statement to

the reporter was, "Well, we certainly could
use more housing, but the golf course sure
is nice."
Okay, so my interview skills are not
much better than my golf game. 1 started
kicking myself the moment the camera was
of 1 for having missed a golden opportunity
to make a strong public statement lx>th
about Stanford's use of its land as well as
about the University's relation to the com
munity in general.
This is what I meant to say:
In my time at Stanford, one of the dom
inant stories in The Daily and other local
papers has been the use of Stanford's land.
Whether it's the General Use Permit, use of
the Foothills or the alteration of the golf
course, everyone around here seems eager
to get their two cents in whenever the
school wants to move a few rocks around.
And every time the issue comes up, Univer
sitv officials feel that their best course of ac

tion is to pussvloot around, hold months of
meetings and pacify Santa Glara County
and the local communities at whatever ex
pense to the University's mission.
Enough is enough. It is lime for the Uni
versity to stop acting like a 110-pound
weakling and to start throwing around
some of that multi-billion dollar heft.
Community members act as though
Stanlbrd has done more harm than good
for the area. Nothing could be further from
the truth! It's not an accident tli.it Silicon
Valley occupies the Santa Clara and San
Jose valleys; it is because of the location of
Stanford University. What were once or
ange groves are now the headquarters <>112
multi-hillion-dollar corporations. And,
thanks to Stanford, properties that were
once worth very little now go for millions.
Areoui neighbors' memories so short?
I he situation here is not ;Â» unique one;
town-gown controversy alllicts many uni

versities. Km the persistence oft he problem
here is striking fora couple reasons. First,
Stanford has a relatively isolated and sell
contained campus. We are not in the mid
dle of Greenwich Village, nor do we have
private businesses interwoven with school
buildings. When fi at parties blast music at 3
a.m., our friends in Atherton aren't being
kept up because of it.
Second, manv of the people who have
problems with Stanford's development
would not be here and would not have the
inflated property values they do il not lor
the ability oft his school to produce great in
novators.
I Ins valley ultimately feeds on tech, and
iliiit has its source at Stanford. If, ">0 years
ago, pioneers like I lewlett, Pat kard, Varian
and (iin/ton not the same hassle, we might
still be surrounded by citrus groves.
Imagine the loss to the world if this were
the case. These companies and the hun

dreds of others that have lbllowed them in
this valley have not just made life more con
venient by allowing us to check our grades
online. 1 hey are responsible for major ad
vances in basic science, space exploration,
national defense and, more recently,
through the PC and Internet revolutions,
in just about even industry in the world.
One function of a great university is to
act asacatalyst. It's no coincidence that real
estate prices near both 1 larvard and Stan
lord have skyrocketed beyond belief. Suc
cess leads to growth, and eventually regula
tion is necessary. But let's have some respect
for the place that spawned all this bounty in
the first place.
Now il I could onh find that reporter
again.
