## Stanford students sound off on electoral process 
### MARK DOMINIK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The controversy surrounding this
year's presidential election has caused
Stanford students to re-examine their
views on voting and the system of electing
a president, particularly the role of the
Electoral College.
This year's presidential election, the
closest in decades, has raised the possibil
ity of a candidate winning in the Electoral
College while not winning the popular
vote â€” an event that has not occurred
since 1888.
"The Electoral College system was in
stalled out of mistrust of the American

public and appears to be obsolete. Never
theless, 1 personally do not trust the U.S.
voters, and would never advocate a direct
democracy," said freshman Alex Tuerpe,
who holds German citizenship.
"1 think [the Electoral College] is a bit
archaic, and because it was designed with
the intent that the general public can't be
trusted, this possibility certainly isn't a
surprise," said freshman Eduardo
Sala/ar. "This system of choosing a presi
dent might be something we want to re
consider."
The potential discrepancy between
electoral votes and popular votes especial
ly bothered some students.
"They definitely need to re-evaluate

the way the Electoral College works if the
person who wins in the Electoral College
isn't the person who wins in popular
votes," said senior Ayaba Worjoloh.
1 lowever, some students claim that the
Electoral College has its benefits.
"[The Electoral College] is helpful in
representing viewpoints from smaller
slates which might not always be paid at
tention to," said sophomore Rachel
Spitzer.
The Founding Fathers created the
Electoral College as an original part of the
Constitution. It has been modified only
twice since 1789.
In 1800, the system was changed so
that electors cast separate votes lor presi

dent and vice president. I lie 23rd
Amendment added electors lor W ashing
ton. D.C.
Another constitutional amendment
would be required to eliminate the Elec
toral College and institute a new system,
such as direct election ol the president.
Freshman Adam Pioirowski claimed
that "the American public is oblivious to
the role the Electoral (College plavs."
Under the current system, the elec
tion can, in lad, be decided on "a few
hundred votes in a particular state,"
Salazar said.
I he close race between Bush and (lore
has prompted some students who did not
vote to re-evaluate thai stance, especially

in light of the controversy that has arisen
alter the election.
One sophomore who did not vote and
wished to remain anonymous said, "I
thought my one vote wasn't going to
change the election. In hindsight, I wish I
had voted."
For some students, not voting does not
stem from apathy but from ignorance.
"I didn't leeltiiat I could make an edu
cated political decision because I haven't
kept up with politics," said one freshman.
Main believe that the close presiden
tial race "will spawn a lot of interest in pol
itics because it's exciting, and young vot
ers saw how one vote can make a difler
ence," said sophomore Jell'(ilenn.
