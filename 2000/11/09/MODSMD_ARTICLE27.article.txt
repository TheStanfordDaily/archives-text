Peninsula voters elected Santa Clara
County Supervisor Joe Simitian to the
State Assembly with 55.4 percent of the
vote Tuesday. The Democrat will repre
sent the 21st District, which includes all of
Stanford's campus.
Simitian defeated Republican Debo
rah Wilder, who garnered 34.9 percent
of the vote. Creen Party candidate Gloria
Pin cell finished third in the balloting
with 9.7 percent.
The 21st District covers 15 towns in
northern Santa Clara County and south
ern San Mateo County.
Simitian will succeed Democrat As
semblyman Ted Lempert, who served
two two-year terms.
"I think that for all of us here on the
Peninsula, transportation, housing and
education are on the top of the list,"
Simitian said. "Keeping the economy
strong (is also] of particular interest and
importance to voters here in Santa Clara
County."
Simitian called representing the dis
trict "a real challenge" because the 15
cities in the district and Stanford all have

their own particular interests.
"Each community ... has its own cul
ture, its own interests and concerns," he
said.
According to Simitian, his election to
the State Assembly will not affect his
views on Stanford's land use proposals.
He said the two topics are "altogether
unrelated."
Simitian proposed last month that
Stanford protect some areas ol the
Foothills from development for 99 years
in exchange for the l iglits to build in the
core campus, a proposal that Stanford
opposes.
The Santa ('.lara (lounty Board of Su
pervisors postponed the vote on Stan
ford's General I'se Permit from Oct. 31
to Nov. 27 so they could more extensive
ly review public comment and debate the
issue.
Simitian represents the Fifth Dis
trict, which covers the northern part
of Santa Clara County, on the Board
of Supervisors. The district includes
parts of Stanford land, as well as the
city of Palo Alto.
Simitian will take office in the As
sembly on Monday, Dec. 4. 1 lad he not
been elected, his term as supervisor
would have ended the first Monday in
January.
His successor in the Fifth District will
probably be Palo Alto Mayor Li/ kniss,
who is leading Foothill College trustee
Dolly Sandoval in a tight race.

"I am pleased for both Li/and the dis
trict," Simitian said. "I think she is well
equipped to do his job."
Simitian said his campaign focused on
his experience in government and in the
private sector. In addition to his term as
supervisor, he has served as mayor of
Palo Alto, lie also held a seat on the
school board of the Palo Alto Unified
School District.
"I made the case ... that 1 was partic
ularly well-equipped to hit the ground
running," he said.
Simitian extended his base of support
from Santa Clara County to San Mateo
County, where he was less well-known.
1 lis two opponents both based their cam
paigns in San Mateo County. Wilder cur
rently serves on San Mateo County's li
brary board.
Wilder said that Simitian raised twice
as much money as she did during the
campaign.
" i wish him the best," she said. "We all
have to work together ... to make the
Peninsula a great place to live."
Simitian sees Stanford as an important
part of his constituency.
"I've had tremendous support from
the folks on the Stanford campus, in
cluding students, faculty and staff," he
said. "I've enjoyed representing Stan
ford 111 the past as county superinten
dent and on the school board. I look
forward to continuing representing
them."
