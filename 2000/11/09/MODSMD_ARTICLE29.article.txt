# Washington Senate race still up in air
## 
### 
SEATTLE (AP) — Republican Sen. Slade
Gorton held a shaky lead Wednesday against
dot-com millionaire Maria Cantwell in the na
tion's last unresolved Senate race.
Of more than 1.6 million votes counted, Gor
ton, an 18-year Senate veteran, led by about
3,200 votes, with hundreds of thousands of ab
sentee ballots still to be counted.
The race could remain unsettled for days.
Cantwell, 42, predicted victory based on ab
sentee ballots, saying most of the uncounted
votes are in King County and other large coun
ties where she ran strongest.
Gorton, 72, said he expects to pull out a vic
tory, too.
"When it's all done, I'm convinced I'll be in
Washington, D.C.," he said.
Cantwell, a senior vice president of the Inter

net audio-video .software company Realnet
works, plowed $10 million of her fortune into a
campaign tfiat suggested Gorton was increas
ingly out of step with the electorate.
Gorton, scion of a New England fish-sticks
family, retorted that he was the candidate with
new ideas and that the $7 million he spent came
from 22,000 donors, not one millionaire's
checkbook.
With winners declared in 33 of the nation's
34 Senate races Tuesday, the GOP will have at
least 50 of the 100 senators.
This year's Senate race in Washington state
was an echo of 1980 — The Upstart vs. The
Elder.
Gorton, then 52, ran against 75-year-old De
mocratic Sen. Warren G. Magnuson and raised
the age issue subtly but clearly. He jogged (>0
miles to file for office and taped commercials in

running clothes, appealing to voters to elect
someone young enough to build seniority and
clout.
Gorton still jogs about 20 miles a week, but
this time he had to look over his shoulder at a
challenger who was born the year he entered
public life.
In her own generational pitch, Cantwell said:
"It's not about age. It's about longevity.
I know in 1980, he had a lot to say alxnit
what happens when you stay in the system too
long, and you forget to listen to people," she
said.
Gorton is counselor to Majority Leader Trent
Lott and a major power on budget committees.
He cites two home-state issues as evidence the
government is getting too big: the antitrust case
against Microsoft and a move to breach dams on
the Snake River to restore salmon runs.
