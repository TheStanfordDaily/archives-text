WASHINGTON, D.C. — Al
though (Jreen Parly presidential
candidate Ralph Nader won't be
entering the ()val ()flice any time
soon, he indicated I uesday night
th;it his work in Washington is tar
from finished.

"In order to become a relent
less watchdog patty, this was just
the first message; this was just the
thunderbolt, Nader told sup
porters and journalists on l ues
da) night. "If they don't get this
message, <ill of you are going to be
very pleased by how fast this

Green Party will
grow."
The party did
not obtain the 5
percent vote it
needed for
matching feder
al funds, but it is
already looking
ahead to Clou-

gressional and local elections iu
two years.
"In 2002, we've got all kinds of
good people will be running for
local offices to build a deep
democracy," Nader told support
ers. "That's what we're all about."
Nader also said that the party
will become the most visible polit
ical group in the country. The
Green Party will work with a< tivisi
groups on the issues Nader em
phasized, including universal
health care, a living wage and im

proving public transportation.
"It's not step by step, as Gore
said, but now," Nader yelled lo his
audience. "After the elections, the
Green Party connects with the cit
izen movement; it does not be
come a corrupt, money-making
machine."
Nader also said thai I uesda\
was the end of the beginning of an
eight-month, clean campaign and
that young people are one key to
the party's success.
"This is the party of the young
generation," Nader said. "This is a
generation that will transform
technologies in our world, rede
fine and reform our foreign poli
cy; this is a generation that is not
squeamish about building a new
progressive party."
Other speakers at Tuesday's
gathering were equally optimistic.

"We've opened doors that
could never be shut again," saicl
Rose Anne Ik-Marco, executive
director of the California Nurses
Association.
Work on Nader's campaign is
not quite finished. Staff still must
file Federal Flection Commission
report to finish by next week and
must dean up after tlu- flurry of
campaign activity.
"I'm going to Europe for 10
months and then I 'm going to try
to write a book about the marriage
between religion and philoso
phy," said volunteer coordinator
and general office manager Brian
Spoon.
Many of the members of Stan
ford's (■reen Party — part of some
25,000 college student Green
Party members — will also take a
break.
"I'm sure that the entire politi
cally involved campus can agree
with me when 1 say that the past
few weeks have been exciting but

exhausting," said junior Martha
Roberts, a Green Parts member.
"Many of us believe that voting for
Nader is essentially a promise to
build the kinds of grassroots ac
tivism and involvement to moni
tor the corporate powers Nader is
running against."
1 he Stanford group may create
a monthly political film series.
"We will hopefully participate
in what will surely become a na
tionwide movement of politic al re
form." said Green Party president
Shachar Link, a doctoral student
in history.
Work will also continue on a
larger s< ale, said Green Part\ USA
secret an Starlene Rankin.
"Like Ralph has been saying,
the Greens are going to be a major
progressive political force and
that's what we're working for; we
won't stop tomorrow," she said in
a telephone interview from Mass
achusetts. "We're aren't just a
party, we're a social movement."
