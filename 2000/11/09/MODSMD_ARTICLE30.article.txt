# Gore's retraction surprises Bush
## 
### 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) —A1 Gore set
aside the stoic valedictory written lor him by
an aide and picked up the phone. George W.
Bush did not take his call happily. "You don't
have to get snippy about this," Gore spat.
The acid of their yearlong light —charac-
ter assaults and name-calling, layered onto the
Clinton-Gore defeat of Bush's father in
1992 — boiled over as Gore, in an under
ground office at the War Memorial, insisted
that Florida's decisive 2f> electoral votes re
mained in limbo.
"Let me make sure I understand," protest
ed Bush, his victory speech in hand. "You're
calling me back to retract your concession?"
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, chastened on Flec
tion Night when it appeared Bush had lost the
state, had just assured his brother it was a done
deal. And the TV networks had already de
clared Texas Gov. George W. Bush the 43rd
president of the United States.
"Let me explain something," Gore lectured
in a stony tone, "your younger brother is not
the ultimate authority on this."
The conversation, quoted to The Associat
ed Press by two of the 2(> or so people in the
room with Gore and anlirmed by a Bush
aide, ended abruptly.
Outside, thousands of supporters, sit k
from the night's roller c< aster drama, shouted
"Stay and light!" and "Recount!"
While campaign chairman William Daley

announced, "Our campaign continues," the
vice president marched unseen from the
Memorial through a side exit. Stranding
dozens of friends, family and V1 Ps in the di i z
zle, he ordered his motorcade back to the
hotel suite where no more than fiO minutes
earlier he had telephoned his congratulations
to Bush.
"He's line," said Gore's brother-in-law,
Frank Hunger, on the sidewalk and looking
fora ride.
President Clinton called (.ore to second his
decision, praise him fora good night and note
consolingly that Gore had won the nation's
popular vote.
Yesterday, the picture of morning-alter
confidence, Bush invited news photographers
into the* dining room of the Governor's Man
sion as he, wife Laura, running mate 1 >ic k ( lli
eney and (!hene\ s wife, 1 .vnne, sal down to a
lunch of chilled soup.
He recalled his exchange with Gore: "1 It'll
like I was fully prepared to go out and give a
speech and thanking my supporters . . . 1
thought it was an interesting comment he
made and listened i<> what he had to sav and
didn't have much to sa\."
Gore .ind most of his famiK slaved in bed
well past noon then wailed out the day at a
hotel across from Vanderbilt University,
where years ago he enrolled in 1 >i\init\ school
to sort out inner conllicts over the live months

he served as an Army journalist in Vietnam.
Son-in-law Drew Schifl slipped out with ilie
vice president's 16-month-old grandson for

SchifFsaid.
