TALLAHASSEE, Fla.
(AP) — Florida officials began
recounting nearly 6 million bal
lots yesterday to determine the
next president, while Democ
rats and some voters com
plained of irregularities in the
election.
The state counted about
2,300 overseas ballots in the
1996 election — more than the
margin separating Gore and
Bush this time — so there is a
remote possibility that those
ballots alone could change the
outcome.
Both Bush and Gore cam
paigned hard in the slate and
regarded it as crucial.
Some counties completed
the count yesterday and for
warded results to Tallahassee
for certification by Republican
Secretary of State Katherine
II an is and Roberts, a Republi
can appointee. Jeb Bush said
lie recused himself.
Although both candidates
typically pick up votes in a re
count. Veterans of the process
said it is unusual for one side to
pick up enough votes to make a
difference in the outcome.
In each county, a county
judge, the chairman of the
county commission and the
local elections supervisor, re
counted the votes by feeding
punch cards through tabula
tion machines three times. The
makeup of the canvassing
board is supposed to insulate
the process from politics, state
elections director ('.lay Roberts
saicl.
Two former secretaries of
state — Warren Christopher
for Gore and |ames A. Baker
111 for Bush— were heading
monitoring teams sent to Flori

da yesterday.
In Florida and elsewhere,
Democrats grumbled about
long lines at the polls, reports
that ballots were late in arriving
at polling places and other pos
sible irregularities. Jesse Jack
son said he got calls on Election
Day complaining that blacks
had difficulty voting in Florida
and other Southern states.
Jackson said some voters
were told there were no more
ballots, or that polls were
closed.
"What we need is not just a
recount by hand, but also a
thorough investigation,' Jack
sou saicl.
NAACP President Kwesi
Mfume said he has asked thejus
tice Department to investigate
what lie called numerous com
plaints of election irregularities
affecting minority voting. He
also wants the federal govern
ment to oversee the recount .
"We are not suggesting foul
play, but we are very much con
cerned that foul play can hap
pen," he said in a statement.
Separately, Democratic offi
cials and hundreds of voters
complained about the way bal
lots in Palm Beach County were
arranged. Voters punched
holes in the middle of the bal
lot. while candidates were alter
nately listed to the left and then
the right.
"It was virtually impossible
to know who you voted for,"
said Mark Hirsch, a 30-year-old
business executive who voted
for Green Party candidate
Ralph Nader.
Some Gore supporters saicl
tliev feared thev mistakenly
voted for Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan. Gore
carried the county by more than 11 (),()()() votes, but the
3,407 votes for Buchanan were by far the most of any
Florida county, and almost 20 percent of his total vote
in the state.
Republicans said the ballot was approved by Palm
Beach County Supervisor of Elections Theresa LePore,
a Democrat.
"The ballot was laid out within accordance with the
statute," Roberts said. "That's a voting system that's
been in use for many years in many counties."
Jeb Bush said he has seen nothing that indicates
fraud, and pledged a fair recount.
"Voter fraud in our state is a felony, and guilty parties
will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law," he said.
