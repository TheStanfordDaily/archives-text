## Soccer begins playoff battle 
### WENDI WHITMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If there was any question about
the youth of the Stanford
women's soccer team (13-5-1
overall, 6-3-0 Pacific 10 (Confer
ence), those questions were all put
to rest very quickly last night.
Entering last night's first
round playoff match against San
Jose State (10-12-1, 3-3-1 Western
Athletic Conference), questions
remained whether the young
Stanford team would be able to
handle the pressure that comes
along with competing on college
soccer's biggest stage, the NCAA
tournament.
But freshman Brittany
(Jliveira, one of the Cardinal's up
and-coming stars, silenced critics
with a go.il in the opening minute
of the match and established the
(Cardinal as a team to beat in the
tournament with a 4-1 win.
Before fans even got comfort
able in their seats, in the third
minute, Oliveira opened the
floodgates for the (Cardinal bv fin
ishing ofl a low-driven, short cor
ner kick from sophomore mid
fielder Kelsev (Carlson.
Less than a minute later,
sophomore forward Marc ia Wal
lis sent a through ball to her front
running partner, Pac-10 Fresh
man of the Year Marcie Ward,
who calmly slotted her 14th goal
of the season. Then, in the 18th
minute, Wallis capitalized on an
error by Spartan goalkeeper Ervn
Meyer and score a goal of her own
to put the Cardinal up 3-0.
San Jose State did manage to
gel itself On the board in the 34th
minute after a temporary lapse b\
the Stanford defense. A cross by
the Spartans Jennifer Mescher
was headed by senior forward
Julie Brum to the far post beyond
the reach of Stanford's senior
goalkeeper (Carly Smolak to bring
the score to 3-1.
The Spartans had no other
dangerous opportunities, because
they were unable to penetrate the
(Cardinal defense led by Smolak
and junior Amy Saner.
After physical play resulted in a
Spartan ejection, Ward calmly
curled in (he ensuing free kick to

score ilie final Cardinal goal.
"In the opening minutes ot'lhe
match, our inexperience in 1 lie
tournament showed," said San
|(»se State head coach Tami
Crimes.
"We were definitely very
happy to be here."
Grimes added that Stanford is
"a well-oiled machine" and is pre
cisely wnere ii needs to be <11 this
point in the season.
Stanford earned a second
round trip to Provo, Utah on Sat
urday to face No. 10 Brigham
Young (18-3-1 overall, (j-() Moun
tain West (conference).
"We are happy with the result
and very happy to lie moving on
in the tournament," said head
coach Andy Nelson.
With the trip to Provo, the Car
dinal hopes to come out with a vic
tory that would advance them to
the third round for the second
year in a row.
A rematch with the winner of
the Santa ( Clara-( California contest
awaits the (Cardinal if they can fin
ish oil the (Cougars.
In addition, a victory for the
(Cardinal would avenge an embar
rassing 6-1 loss to the (Cougars
that Stanford sustained during
the first round of the 1998 tour
nament.
The No. 10 (Cougars, the
Mountain West Conference
champions, are led bv senior mid
fielder Michelle Peterson and
freshman midfielder Aleisha
(Cramer and will enter Saturday's
match with more rest than the
(Cardinal after receiving a first
round bye.
Stanford will have to contend
with a rowdy BYU crowd and
frigid temperatures in order to
snap the (Cougars' eight game
winning streak.
But if last night's match was
any indication, the young (Cardi
nal stars are poised to compete on
the national stage.
"Everyone has been saying that
we are so young, but 1 think that's
what's going to help get us
through.
"We can compete with any of
these teams, we just have to show
it — one game at a time," said
Wallis.
