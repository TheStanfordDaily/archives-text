The way the basketball l)ounced at
Maples Pavilion lasi night, you can
hardly blame Jason Collins lor
throwing up .it halltime.
In the 2000 preseason debut lot
the No. 4 Stanford men's basketball
team, the Cardinal battled through
a flu bug aliening part of the team
and defeated the KA Sports Califor
nia All-Stars 91-70 in an exhibition
game.
Marred by 53 fouls and low field
goal percentages for most of the
contest, the ('.animal s performance
didn't exactly please head coach
Mike Montgomery.
"We've got a long way to go," said
Montgomery. "We're missing some
thing right now — we're just not
playing hard enough. I here are
tilings we have to do, like defending
and rebounding, and they weren't
happening."
Along with the flu, other injuries
kept Stanford from being at full
strength. Most notably absent was
redshirt freshman Justin Davis, who
sat out with an abdominal pull
One player who did make his
Stanford debut, and managed to
raise mot e than a few eyebrows, was
freshman power forward Teyo
lohnson. Leavinu his job as the No.

3 quarterback on the football team
three weeks ago, Johnson showed
no ill effects from his side duties last
night, bringing impressive hustle
and astounding athleticism onto the
fl<x>r.
" Teyo has really saved us tight
now at power forward," said Mont
gomery. "I le's a little undersized (at
C)-l(H)t-7J, but he's quick and gives us
another dimension."
Sophomore Curtis Borchardt,
who has missed a number of prac
tices as his light foot recovers from
off-season surgery, played 20 min
utes and had a solid game despite
having his movement hampered.
Borchardt finished with 15 points
and 10 rebounds, along with three
impressive blocks.
"1 le's at about 70 percent... he's
not in shape and his timing is off, but
... he's still really good," said Mont
gomery of Borchardt.
Senior center Jarron (lollins qui
etly controlled the paint during his
25 minutes, dropping in 23 points
and grabbing 10 rebounds.
Collins also showed of! his im
pressive range in the second half,
stepping out behind the arc fora
three-pointer.
Stanford's next exhibition game
is Tuesday night against Clobal
Spoils, with a 7:30 p.m. tipofl at
Maples Pavillion.
