Senior golfer Jimmy Lee took ibis advice to
heart last weekend when he was having trouble
making putts with his regular putter and de
cided to use the one laying in the hallway of the
Sigma Alpha Kpsilon fraternity house.
The switch proved effective as Lee captured
the first individual title of his collegiate c areer
and led the Cardinal to a third-place finish
Tuesday at 1 he Prestige at Palm Desert, Calif.
Lee put the putter to work after suffering an
unlucky lost-ball penalty that led to a double
bogey on the 15th hole of his final round.
He dropped birdie putts on the Kith and
IHIII holes to tie Pepperdine's Michael Beard
for the lead and closed out the vic tory by sink
ing a 45-foot eagle putt on the second playoff
hole.

The I'mal pull "could have gone about lour
leet by, but ii hit the back of the cup and went
in," said Lee, who finished with rounds of (59-
08-73 (-()).
"It was an amazing feeling since there was a
ton of people out there."
I he Cardinal (858) carried a two-stroke
lead into (lie final round hut had trouble
weathering an erratic wind (hat al times car
ried gusts of np to 30 mph.
"It was an interesting weather day, but we
should have played well since we're used to
playing in the wind," said head coach Jeff
Mite hell, noting thai some of his players come
from windy areas in I exas, Hawaii and
Kngland.
Junior Philip Rowe posted his third top-l()
finish of the fall, with rounds of 70-72-71 (-3),
to finish in seventh place. Sophomore George
Downing shot 75-72-73 (+4) to tie for lNih
place, while senior Kric Dahlberg tied for 22nd
place, shooting 74-70-77 (+5).

Rounding out the Cardinal squad were
sophomores Jim Seki (09-78-78, +9) and Ron
Won (81-77-84, +20).
The third-place finish ends a fall season that
has been filled with improvement for the
Cardinal.
Its No. 70 rating following ninth and 10th
place finishes early in the season has now
moved up to 28th due to a tournament vi< lory
it) Fresno and a strong finish at the Nelson In
vitational two weeks ago.
"I've thought all along that this is a top-10
team, and it's just a matter ol time," said
Mitchell of a squad that led eventual champi
ons, No. H Northwestern (855), by three
strokes heading into the final round on Tues
day.
"We showed what we are capable ol doing in
the first two rounds."
"We have the talent, and people are starting
to realize it," Lee said.
I his finish "gives us more con
fidence, and going into future
tournaments with that confidence
makes all the difference in the

world."
Mitc hell noted that the Cardi
nal's pl,i\ has been dependent on
strong finishes In many members
of the team, not just one or two
players.
