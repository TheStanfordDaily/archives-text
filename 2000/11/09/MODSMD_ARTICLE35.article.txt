# Pac-10 takes the money and runs...to L.A.
## 
### 
Ah, basketball season. I can already feel
iis sweet numbing presence slipping
back into my veins like morphine.
Nothing gets ibis campus excited like
jeering some corporate exhibition team.
In all the excitement and good feeling oft he
preseason, though, you might have missed the
Pacific 10 Conference announcing the worst
idea since Wile K. Coyote's dynamite-powered
roller skates. Seems the high mucky-mucks
over at FOX made the conference officials an
offer they couldn't refuse, and so, starting next
season, tlie conference champion won't be the
team that wins the most games — it'll be the
one that wins the* weekend-long postseason
tourney.
I admit a certain bias in this assessment; I've
never liked conference tournaments of any
kind in a spoil which already has an NCAA
tournament. The unnatural distinction be
tween regular-season c hampion and confer
ence tournament champion offends me. It's
like college football before the BCS.
But even if I loved the idea in principle,
bringing back the conference tournament in
the Pac -10 strikes me as a little suspicious. I lie
Pac-10 hasn't had a tournament since 1990,
with good reason. The last time the league
tried this stunt, it was a disaster; you couldn't
have filled a Lag double with the crowds that
showed up in Los Angeles to watch.
I he college basketball landscape is rather
different now, though, and after 10 years of
watc lung KSPN Hood the airwaves with confer
ence tournaments large and small, the Pac-10

lias been seduced by the old
est of enticements: money
and fame.
The money's the easy
part. FOX, which owns a
hefty chunk of the Staples
Center in L.A., approached
the Pac-10 with a six-year
television contract. Although
the terms weren't disclosed,
one can assume that Rupert

Murdoch's hoys would drop a fair amount ol
coin al ihe prospect ol Stanlbrd vs. Arizona six
years in a row. Even without predicting sell
outs, the l'ac-10 expects to he making mil
lion a year that it can divvy up among the mem
ber s< hools.
The lame, though, isa little rnoret lever, and
t'-.us probably more dangerous. I'ac-IO Asst.
(lommissioner |im Muldoon says that in the
last weekend ol basketball season last year, the
I'ac-10 "kind ol dropped into a black hole." In
the week be I ore Selection Sunday, the best way
lot a team on the N( lA\bubble to plead its case
lot a bid is to gel some national I V exposure.
"In a way, it's the first week ol"March Mad
ness — a playoff into the playoffs." says Mul
doon.
I he reasoning, then, is simple: tournament
= more exposure = more NCAA bids = high
er profile = more free cocktail weenies at the
Pac-1() league meetings. Everybody wins!
But why will the attendance be any better
this time around? Muldoon points out a key
truth: "We were not a very good league back

when we last had a tournament." Thai is to say,
nobody from Tucson's going lo come when
their 'dais are 85th in the nation, but when
they're No. 1 ? Call up the Motel 6. It's a pretty
powerful argument: free money, national tele
vision. love and adoration ofTins.
It's also a load of hooey.
Arguments based on exposure fly pretty
well for conferences like America Hast or Mis
souri Valley, where voters are lucky to see reg
ular-season scores reported. Fora conference
like the Pac-10, home of some of the biggest
names in the game, and dominated lately by a
very few powerhouses, the argument fails. It's
a national stage, all right, but tli.it just means
more people watching when you fall. For ever)
bubble team thai "proves" itself against the big
boys, there'll be three that get embarrassed in
the first round and play themselves out of a
tourney spot.
"I think people are kidding themselves if
they think we're going to get more teams from
the Pac-10 into the tournament as a result,"
says head coat h Mike Montgomery, a longtime
detractor of the conference tournament.
Montgomery and Arizona's Lute Olson
have been the plan's biggest ft>es for some lime,
which makes sense. I lie conference elite can be
rclativcl) assured of an NCAA bid without ail)
additional national television time; they don't
need the exposure or the money.
For the ('.ardinal program, the new tourna
ment onl\ means another week of conference
