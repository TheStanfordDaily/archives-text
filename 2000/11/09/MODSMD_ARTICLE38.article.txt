# Cardinal falls at UOP, looks to Cal
## Women's volleyball, with just three Pac-10 matches left, enters stretch of must-win contests 
### EZRA CALLAHAN STAFF WRITER 
One could argue that the No. 20 Stanford
women's volleyball team, which boasts one of
the most talent-Jilled rosters in the nation, has
greatly underachieved this season, with a 14-10
overall record and a 7-.S record in the Pacific 10
Conference.
At the same time, Stanford is still a con
tender for the national championships, and
with its match on Tuesday night against No. 10
University of the Pacific, the Cardinal again
showed that it tan compete with any team in
the country.
I he CCardinal was defeated at U( )P (21 -3) in
three games in a non-conference match but
challenged the red-hot Tigers well enough to
show that the match could have gone either
way.
Stanford returns to Pac-10 play tomorrow,
visiting California (10-18, 5-10 Pac-10) for the
(-animal's last road game of the regular season.
Stanford started slcnvh in all three games on
l uesday night but still managed to make most
of the match a fight.
"1 think we played much better against Pa
cific than we did last weekend," said junior out
side hitter Para Conrad, referring to the Car
dinal's split matches with the Washington
schools.
"We got ourselves in trouble and got down

early, and against this level a team, you can't do
that."
The Cardinal and the Tigers matched up
evenly statistically for the night, a surprising
fact considering that UOP ran up leads of at
least five points in the early parts of each game.
"Getting down earl) was the deciding factor
in the match," said senior setter Lindsay ka
gawa. "If we played the whole match the way
we did in the late parts ofeach of the games, we
would have won."
In the first game, UOP took an early 0-1
lead. The Tigers expanded the lead to 12-4, but
the Cardinal fought back to within three at 14-
11, holding off five game points for U( )1' in the
process. The Tigers finally put the Cardinal 15-
11 away on their sixth game point.
Sophomore outside hitter Logan Tom post
ed nine of her 25 kills for the match in the first
game.
Tom, who hit .435 for the match, has had
double-digit kills in even match since her re
turn to the team four weeks ago.
The Cardinal stumbled again early in game
two, giving up the first seven points to the
Tigers.
Stanford came storming back however, and
evened the match at 7-7. UOP took the lead
back, but Stanford held close at 12-10.
I he Tigers were able to take advantage of
several Cardinal hitting errors to close out the
game 15-10. Stanford was held to a . 1 OS hitting
percentage lot the second game.
U()P took a 6-0 lead to start the third game,
but this time the Cardinal was never able to re
cover.
The Tigers posted 26 kills to Stanford's If) in
the final game and finished the match with a
15-8 win.

The Tigers extended their winning streak to
13 matches, during which they have not
dropped a single game. I ()P had four players
tallv double-digit kills, led In Courtney Miller
who had 17.
Tom and Kagawa each had 12 digs to lead
the Cardinal defensively. Sophomore outside
hitter Ashley Ivy picked up 10 kills for Stan
ford, which liii .227 for the match.
1 he Cardinal now turns iis attention back to
the Pac-10, where the Cardinal has had un
precedented struggles this year.
Stanford's 7-8 conference record is not sur
prising when a quick glance at the national
rankings shows that three of the four teams in
front of Stanford in the conference are in the
top 10.
" There's no dominating team in the confer
ence," said Ivy. "So the numbers and the
records don't matter too much going into the
tournament."
Stanford is still in a must-win situation head
ing into its last three conference matches start
ing with Cal tomorrow and with the Oregon
schools next weekend.
"It's super-important to beat Cal for tourna
ment rankings," said Kagawa. "We need to
make an impact on the judges who decide the
brackets."
Fortunately for Stanford, the Bears come
into the match having lost six of their last seven
conference matches.
Cal is also coming oil'a brutal 3-0 loss to No.
10 Santa Clara on Tuesday, during which the
Bears only scored three points in the final two
games.
The Bears are led bv outside hitter Alicia
Perry who is averaging 4.40 kills per game and
a Pac-10 leading 4.33 digs per game.
