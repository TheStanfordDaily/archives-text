### MEREDITH ROWE EDITORIAL STAFF 
AUSTIN,Texas â€” The nation may have lo
wait 10 days to learn the name of its next pres
ident, thanks to a Florida race so tight that
even a recount may not reveal the winner.
Florida election officials are now retabulat
intr all the states votes. The results should he

available by 5 p.m. EST today, and Florida
Secretary of State Katherine Harris said she
would probably declare a winner when the re
count is over.
As of 3 a.m. EST today, with votes recount
ed in 21 of 67 counties, Texas Gov. George \\'.
Hush's lead over Vice President A1 Gore stood
at 1,27S votes of about f> million cast. The re
count has trimmed Bush's lead, which stood at
1,784 votes early yesterday morning.
Possibly ;ii issue are absentee ballots mailed
overseas. B\ law, these ballots may arrive as
late as ()ct. 17 and still be counted in the elec
tion.
II these ballots prove a lac tor in the race, the
final results may not be available for more than
a week.
Both (andidates need Florida's 25 electoral
votes to gain the necessary 270 votes in the
Electoral Gollege for victor) in the election.
Officials in Austin remained optimistic , in
dueling the governor himself.
" I his morning brings news Irom Florida
that the final vote count there shows tli.it Sec
retarv (Dick) Gheney and 1 have carried the
state of Florida," Bush told reporters in front
of the Governor's Mansion yesterday after
noon. "And if that result is confirmed by an au
tomatic recount, as we expect it to be, then we
have won the election."
Florida election law mandates that ballots
must be counted again if the winning candi
date's margin of victory Vs Vess tVian one half ol
one percent.
()t her controversy has surrounded the vot
ing results in Florida. According to Palm
Beach Count) voters, the ballots were confus
ing, leading them to believe they were casting
votes lor Gore when they were actually voting
for Relbrm Party candidate Pat Buchanan.
Three voters are suing, seeking a new elec
tion in the county because of this confusion.
Buchanan did garner a much larger percent
of the vote in Palm Beach County than in the
rest of the state: a total 0f3,407 votes.
Officials nullified 19,000 ballots in the coun
ty Wednesday night because voters had
marked more than one presidential candidate.
Speculation yesterday centered around
vvhai was thought to be a box full of uncount
ed ballots found at a c hurch. The box, when
opened, turned out instead to contain only
cleri< al supplies.
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, George W. Bush's
younger brother, remained confident lhai lus
stale would prove a victory for his sibling and
assured that the vote recount would be fair.
" 1 he stakes are high and thecirc umstances
demand responsibility by both political par-

ties," he said yesterday.
The recount appears to have
buoyed the Gore campaign.
"We now need to resolve this
election in a way that is fair and
fort hright, and in a way that is fully
consistent with the Constitution
and our laws," Gore said in a state
ment yesterday afternoon. "Be
cause of what is at stake, this matter
must be resolved expeditiously, but
deliberately and without any rush
to judgment."
CNN initially declared Bush as
the winner of the election early
Wednesday morning, after it
seemed certain Florida's 25 elec
toral votes would go to the Repub
lican candidate.
However, shortly after the 2:15
a.m. EST announcement, and fol
lowing Gore's concessionary
phone t all to Bush, officials was de

termined that the Florida results
were still up in the air.
The final vote count showed
Bush holding the narrowest of
leads, 1,784 votes out of the state's
nearly 6 million.
After initially conceding shortly
after CNN called Florida for Bush,
Gore retracted his statement in a
second phone call, evidently upset
ting Bush.
"Let me make sure I under
stand," Bush said during the
phone call, after writing his victory
speech. "You're calling me back to
retract your concession?"
"You don't have to get snippy
about this," Gore responded. "Let
me explain something. Your
younger brother is not the ultimate
authority on this," referring to Jeb
Bush's promise to his brother that
Florida would be delivered into his
hands.
Currently, (jore has 200 elec
toral votes. Bush trails with 240.
Oregon's 7 electoral votes have not

yet been distributed, as voting was
done entirely by mail and the
counting process is proceeding
slowly.
Two hundred seventy votes are
needed to win. If Bush does carry
Florida, he will have a total of 271
votes. Conversely, if the recount
works in Gore s favor, he will be the
new president with 285 votes.
Even after the votes are count
ed, the country still lias to wait for
the Electoral College to convene in
December.
Political analysts have suggested
that it is possible, though not likely,
that an elector may go against the
wishes of her state and vote differ
ently. This scenario has happened
only three times in the country's
history.
Pundits focused on tlis possibili
ty becuase Gore has captured the
lead in the popular vote, with
48,863,889 votes compared to
Hush's 48,676,282.
