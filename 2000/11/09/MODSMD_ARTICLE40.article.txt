### NICHOLAS CHAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Under•graduate Advising (lenter
is considering separating freshmen and
sophomore advising alter a Faculty Sen
ate report issued last month questioned
the (acuity's involvement in the current
program.
According to Director of Undergrad
uate Advising Lori White, the root of the
problem is the small number of faculty
freshman advisers. C urrently, only one
iilili of the 200 (ieshman advisers are
iaculh members.
I he center prefers faculty members
as advisers because they are more famil
iar with the Stanford curriculum and
acadcmic environment than graduate
students or stall members.
"What faculty can do is understand
the nature of a particular discipline,"
White said. " I hey can also encourage
students to become partners in the
whole research enterprise."
Sophomore Ana Lombera, an advis
ing associate (an upperc lassman who
works with fresh men), had a graduate
student as her freshman adviser.
"\lv FA was a grad student. She was

very sweet, but she wasn't involved with
the school." Lombera said.
Since many sophomores stay with
theii freshman advisers until they de
clare their majors, the two classes cur
rently share the few faculty advisers.
The new plan would mean separate
advisers loi freshmen and sophomores.
Graduate students or other stall mem
bers would still advise freshmen.
Sophomores, whose plans are gener
ally more developed than those ol Iresh
men. would have a better chance of
working with faculty members.
"We want to continue to ask the ques
tion 'What is the best role for faculty to
play in advising pre-major students?'
White said.
Currently, freshmen can sign up for
extra advising programs, such as Fresh
man Advising Resources and Mentoring
or Partners for Academic Fxcellence.
Students in these programs meet once a
week with student advisers and receive a
more personalized advising experience.
Students say that sophomore year is a
more difficult year loi advising because
the) lose contact with their advising as
sociate from freshmen year. In addition,
advisers usually spend less time with

their sophomore advisees.
White said that the advising center
was currently disc ussing other advising
options lor sophomores.
The proposals include advising at up
perclass houses, such as Row houses,
without live-in advising.
Peer departmental advising is anoth
er possibility.
Under a two-year-old sophomore
mentor program, sophomores can pick
ilirir freshman seminar teacher as their
adviser.
Sophomores can also go to the Un
dergraduate Advising Center for advis
ing. Dorms such as I oyon Hall, the all
sophomore dorm, and Freshman-
Sophomore (College offer general advis
ing geared toward sophomores.
Stanford students point to the transi
tion between freshman and sophomore
year as a local point.
Alter a war at Stanford, students are
familiar with the curriculum, but don't
have enough experience or information
to choose a major.
"I think a lot of people fall through
the c racks as sophomores, but it's due to
the students, not the advisers," l.ombera
said.
