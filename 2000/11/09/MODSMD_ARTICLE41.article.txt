### SUSAN TIEH 
John Giuliano, an American who has
lived in El Salvador for eighteen years and
fought in the country's civil war, will speak
about his experiences in El Salvador at 8
p.m. tonight in the Toyon I fall lounge.
According to sophomore Jessica Jenk
ins, Giuliano's speech will focus on the
United States' involvement in El Sal
vador's 12-year civil war, the connection
between religion and political activism and
the current social and political environ
ment in El Salvador.
A group of students recently formed

the Student Forum on Latin America after
attending a Sophomore College program
called "Ethics and Empire." The course fo
cused on American foreign policy in Latin
America.
The group plans to bring other speak
ers to the University to discuss both histor
ical and current issues in Latin America,
said Jenkins.
Giuliano, originally from New York,
traveled to El Salvador in 1982 to train to
become a Jesuit priest. While in El Sal
vador, he decided to end his studies with
the Jesuits.
Like other missionaries, Giuliano be

came involved in the civil war. He joined
the FMLN, a guerrilla force that is now a
socialist political party in El Salvador.
After the war ended in 1991, Giuliano
moved to the village of Guarjila, located in
the war-ravaged Chalatenango zone. He
founded a youth group named El
Tamarindo, after the especially resilient
fruit of the tamarind tree.
The group has promised to pay for its
members to attend high school and col
lege, because public school ends after the
ninth grade in Guarjila and private insti
tutions are too expensive for most families.
To fund its efforts, El Tamarindo hosts

American college students in Guarjila each
year and Giuliano travels to college cam
puses to raise awareness and support for
his cause. Giuliano will speak about op
portunities for students to go to El Sal
vador during the summer.
According to Jenkins, the visiting stu
dents live with i he Salvadoran families and
work alongside them. The Student Forum
is also planning a similar 10-day trip to El
Salvador during spring break.
The civil war in El Salvador lasted from
1979 to 1991. It grew out of turmoil over
the inequitable distribution of wealth and
land among the country's citizens.

Guerrilla forces supporting the peasant
farmers fought against the national gov
ernment's paramilitary forces, which were
supported by the United States.
Although both sides committed war
crimes, observers have blamed govern
ment forces toi the majority of atrocities,
including the deaths of six Jesuit priests.
As a result, they have questioned the role
of the United States, which provided fund
ing and military support.
I he Student Forum on Latin America,
the Catholic Community at Stanford and
the Religious Studies Department are
sponsoring Giulianos speech.
