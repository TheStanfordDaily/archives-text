# Cisco to develop new campus in Coyote Valley
## 
### COLLEEN O'BRIEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Oct. 25, the San Jose City Council
unanimously approved Cisco Systems'
proposal to develop a 6.6 million square
foot campus in Coyote Valley.
This approval parallels the current
controversy at Stanford over developing
the Foothills to provide additional facili
ties and student housing.
Coyote Valley serves as an eight-mile
long buller between the southern suburbs
of San Jose and the city of Morgan I fill.
The San Jose community expected the
council to approve the measure, despite
opposition from environmental groups
and concerns that Cisco's estimated
20,000 new workers will Hood the area,
drive up housing prices and crowd roads
incapable of handling thousands of new
commuters.
The Santa Clara Count v Board of Su

pervisors has postponed a decision on
Stanford's General Use Permit until late
next month.
San Jose Mayor Ron (ion/ales support
ed the Cisco project.
"This is a great project for the city of
San Jose," he told the San Jose Mercury
News. "It will ensure continued economic
prosperity."
(lisco, one of the world's premier com
puter networking companies, should
spread the Bay Area's trend of high-tech
prosperity to the mostly deserted farm
land of Coyote Valley. The building pro
ject is expected to generate more than
$150 million in tax revenues.
Many San Jose residents, union mem
bers and charities, some of which have
benefited from Cisco's philanthropy, ap
prove of the project.
"It's something we dreamed about 20
years ago," former City Councilman Jerry
Est ruth told the Mercury News.

But for many, the realization of this
dream looks more like a nightmare, mir
roring fears of Palo Alto residents who live
near Stanford.
"Coyote Valley is important to save be
cause it prevents San Jose and Morgan
1 lill from becoming like cities along the El
( '.amino, where you can't tell if you're in
Sunnyvale, Santa Clara or Mountain
View," said Craig Breon, executive direc
tor of the Audubon Society, in an Oct. 28
article in the Mercury News.
I he local chapters ol Audubon, the
Sierra Club and Landwatch Monterey
(lounty are planning to sue the c ity to pre
vent the domino eflect they believe the
(lisco project will cause.
"Corporations must stop building
sprawling of lice campuses that are conta
minating our air and water, creating traf
fic jams and destroying our quality of life,"
said l om Steinbach, executive director of
the Green belt Alliance, to the Mercury

News. The Alliance agreed last month not
to sue Cisco in exchange lor a donation of
$3 million to preserve open spaces.
The deal between Greenbelt and San
Jose, requiring long-term protection of
some land in exchange for permission to
develop, resembles the plan suggested by
Supervisor Joe Simitian for Stanford's
land development.
The Board's postponement ol its deci
sion reflects the- tension over Simitian's
proposal to require Stanford to leave
roughly half of the Foothills undeveloped
lor a century in exchange for permission
to build the 17 acres of'academic facilities
proposed by the University for the next
decade.
Stanford has said that it would accept a
compromise plan approved by the (boun
ty's Planning ( onimission that would pre
vent development in the Foothills lor 25
years bv creating an academic growth
boundary.
