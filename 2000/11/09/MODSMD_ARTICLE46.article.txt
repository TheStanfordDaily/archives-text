# Stanford 'D' not getting big breaks
## Willingham says his lagging defense must improve its poor turnover ratio as season concludes 
### ANTHONY LEE 
Earlier ibis season, head coach Tyrone Willing
ham jokingly stated that Cardinal defenders
should put sacks of Hour in their uniforms lo
match up against Washington's gigantic offensive
linemen.
Perhaps Willingham was hoping that the Cardi
nal delense would cook up some key turnovers,
something Stanford's defensive unit has failed to do
on a consistent basis ibis season.
'Chough Stanford's defensive rankings have
beenconsistently poor all season (seventh in the Pa
cific 10 Conlerence in total delense as well .is indi
vidually against the run and the pass), its failure to
take the ball awa\ from opposing ollenses has been
especially disconcerting to Willingham.
"Che drastic dilference between a successful
team one year ago and our team ibis year is thai we
are not creating turnovers," Willingham said.
"We're not making those big plays to get us over
ihe top."
C.tsi season, Sianlbrd's defense was opportunis
tic, making up Ibi he yardage it allowed by c reat
ing key turnovers that changed the momentum of
games and the season.
Against Oregon State last season, Cardinal de
lenders stripped the ball from Beaver tailback Ken
Simonton twice inside the 10-yard line to preserve
the win.
Later in the vear. Cardinal safety Tim Smith in
tercepted a pass in I lie- waning seconds against I S( 1
inside the 10-vard line to preserve another .Stan
lord win.
I his year, however, the defense lias been giving
up huge momentum-changing plays without creat
ing its own.
In the game at Oregon State, Beaver quarter
back Jonathon Smith's 07- and 76-yard touchdown
passes to Chad Johnson and T.|. Housh
mand/adch, respectively, marred an otherwise
solid defensive performance against a potent Ore
gon Slate offense.
" Chose big plays b) Oregon Slate KOed us,"
Willingham said.
Botched tackles, missed assignments and failed
gambles on the field have made the defense less
than dominant, as demonstrated last weekend
against UCLA.
Chough Cardinal defensive back Brian Taylor
ended I'ClA's scoring drive In intercepting Bruin
quarterback Cory Paus's pass in the red /one. the
Cardinal secondary gave up a 41-yard touchdown

pass to UCLA Hanker Freddie Mitchell, who went
untouched in the end /one.
Mitchell also grabbed a 56-yard jump-ball pass
from Paus in the closing minutes of a game in which
Bruin running back DeShaun Foster ran for L>{)
yards and scored two touchdowns by constantly
avoiding wave upon wave of would-be Stanford
tacklers.
Though Stanford defenders have shown flashes
of brilliance at times against the run and the pass,
they have been frustratingly inconsistent, failing to
put together < onsecutive stops.
Dominant defensive displays against I exas,
where the Cardinal limited powerful Longhorn
running back Hodges Mitchell to 59 yards and
stymied Texas s quarterback tandem of Major Ap
plewhite and Chris Simms, have been dwarfed by
performances like that against Washington.
Against the Huskies, Stanford failed to pressure
Huskies quarterback Marcus Tuiasosopo, who
marched Washington 80 yards on three plays to
beat the Cardinal.
Senior leaders RiallJohnson, who leads the I'ac
-10 with 1 .'J sacks, and Willie I foward, the defense's
emotional anchor, have carried the defense I his
year on their backs with their stellar play. 1 lowev
er, that substantial effort often lias not been
enough.
Though Johnson's sack total jumps off the slat
sheets, Willingham has been more impressed by
Johnson's overall contribution to the defense. John
son also leads the Pac-1() with 17 tackles for losses.
"Riall has done an excellent job in terms of exe
cution," Willingham said. "He is doing more than
just sacking quarterbacks."
Cardinal defenders have not been aided l>v an of
fense that has been anemic at times and a lutile
punting game that ranks last in the I'ac-10.
Stanford quarterbacks Rand\ Fasani and Chris
Lewis and the rest of the offense have struggled tins
season, putting the defense in the unenviable posi
tion of starting its series in or dose to Cardinal ter
ritory quite often.
Willingham believes Stanford's ollense and de
fense are interrelated, saying that Stanford's minus
six turnover margin has put the Cardinal "behind
the eight ball" in many games.
"T he more our offense is on the field, the de
fense in my opinion gets better automatically,' Will
ingham said.
" Fhe more turnovers we get, then the more our
offense can score."
Willingham said he believes that the Stanford's
defense has been improving and that he admires his
defenders' effort and character.
lini if the Cardinal are to put the skids on anoth
er frustrating season, the defense must do more
than take solace in Willingham's praise — it must
take away the ball away from its opponents.
