(Graduate teaching assistants at New York I niversity
on Wednesday finally got to talk the votes that they cast
in a union election back in April. But 111 keeping with
the current theme of inconclusive elections, they won't
know the outcome lor several days.
Thai's because some of the ballots were contested
during the count at a regional office of the National
Labor Relations Board, the teaching assistants learned
that they had voted 597 to 418 to lorm a bargaining
unit affiliated with the I nited Automobile Workers.
The trouble is, 295 additional voles that had been
cast couldn't be tallied Wednesday. I hose ballots had
been contested — either by the union or by the Nation
al Labor Relations Board officials — both of whom be
lieved that some of the people who voted were ineligi
ble to cast their ballots because they were not part of the
predetermined bargaining unit.
The U.A.W. would have had to win its representa
tion election In a margin of more than 295 votes to
avoid dealing with the contested ballots. Because it
didn't, the process will take at least several more days —
and possibly hearings — before one of two things hap
pens: Fuller NA'.l . and the graduate students must
decide which of the additional votes can be counted and
which should be scrapped, or the labor board will step
in to do it.
