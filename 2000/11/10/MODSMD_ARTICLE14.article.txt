cle titled "Firemen Foil Bonfire Sabotage
Plans."
"Blazing Big Game bonfire lumber lent
â€¢in orange glow to the night skv Saturday at
9:30 p.m.
"The Stanford Fire Department arrived
minutes after the lire began, and the second
attempt to burn this year's growing pile of
wood in Lake Lag was thwarted in 15 min
utes. . . .
"Freshman guards will be posted at Lake
Lag beginning Wednesday to prevent fu
ture attempts to retard construction of the
bonfire. ...
"Despite the recent mishaps, Bonfire
(lonmiittee chairman ('.hue k Kashima de
scribes the woodpile as 'very good.' 1 he
bandhouse porch has been torn down and
added to it, railroad ties have been ob
tained, and 2,000 fruit crates are being
