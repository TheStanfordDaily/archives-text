## Historians research past media election faux pas 
### 
ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) —A close
election. A confused result. And a revolu
tionary, wireless technology meant to
bring news to people instantly.
1 he year was 1910 and from New
York, Lee l)e Forest, an inventor and
radio pioneer, made the first radiobroad
cast of presidential election results. The
new president of the I 'nited States, lie an
nounced, was ( Tarlcs Evans 1 lughes.
l)e Forest's second unintended mile
stone was becoming the first broadcaster
to gel it wrong— Woodrow Wilson actu
ally was the winner.
l hc incident was one of many media
laux pas concerning presidential elec
tions lound by researchers at the Newse
um, a museum focused on the news
media. Inspired In the 2000 election and
the news media's premature declarations
of victory following Tuesday's voting, the
researchers found seven elections in their
archives in which the media announced
the wrong winner, said Eric Newton, a
news historian.
"The fundamental problem is you
can't report what hasn't happened yet.
No matter how fast news gets, you can
never get faster than live," Newton
said. "These kinds of mistakes have al
ways been made, and sometimes it's the
rush, the speed of try ing to get a scoop,
sometimes it's bias, sometimes it's an
act ident."
In addition to the famous Chicago
Dailv Tribune headline "Dewcv Defeats

Truman"in 1948, Newton cited other ex
amples, such as when the Bay State
Democracy of Boston gave the 1840 elec
tion to Martin Van Buren instead of
William Henrv Harrison and the El Paso
Limes incorrectlv reported that William
Jennings Bryan had defeated William
Mckinley in 1890. A more thorough
search would find even more examples,
he said, especially in close elections.
Newton spent Wednesday discussing
past «md present media mistakes with visi
tors to the Newseum, which displays the
front pages of newspapers from around
the world.
"T lie information explosion gives us
this chance to look behind the scenes of
news," he said. "Now we're able to see
how chaotic election nights really are,
and everyone gets to feel like they're part
ol thecra/v newsroom that can't quite lig
ure out what's going on."
Newton said De Forest wasn't alone in
picking the wrong winner in 19Hi — the
Cleveland Plain Dealer ran a banner
headline proclaiming "Hughes wins
Election."
Now the 2000 election has contributed
dozens of examples — of the 40 Ameri
can papers on display at the Newseum,
15 initially declared Texas Gov. George
W. Bush the winner on Wednesday, said
Tim Kenny, the news history director. By
next week, the museum should have a
new exhibit dedicated to those papers
and their subsequent corrected editions.
