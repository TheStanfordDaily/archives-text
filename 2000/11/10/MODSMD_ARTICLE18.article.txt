## The 						Stanford Daily Stanford needs to educate on labor issues 
### 
Published Since 1S91

THK (.RAPE VOTE ties Stanford stu
dents to an important labor issue in
(lalifornia. Yet for the majority of Stan
ford students, it has lost its meaning.
They see the grape vote as symbolic and unim
portant. The University needs to take responsi
bility for educating students about labor issues in
California. Until students are informed about
the conditions of workers, they are not likely to
understand the importance of these issues that
have such great consequence fot the state of Cal
ifornia. While we encourage students to t.ike the
initiative to inform themselves and vote next
week on the grapes issue, we charge the Univer
sity with the responsibilit\ for putting together
an educational program that better informs
students about labor conditions.
Over the years, the University lias been a
leader in advanc ing the cause of humanity, prin
cipally through the research activities of its fac
ulty and the education of its students. As the
Cirape Policy Committee Report states, "Stan
ford University's Founding (.rant states that one
of the fundamental purposes of the university is
to promote the public welfare bv exercising an
influence in behalf of humanity and civilization."
I lie University has a stated responsibility for
helping students become informed, concerned

and responsible citizens.
In keeping with this fundamental mission,
when the issue of a grape boycott first arose at
Stanford, the University created an educational
initiative. It asked that students learn about the
relationship between grapes, pesticides and
working conditions for farm workers, and that
they make an informed decision about serving
grapes in their dormitories.
In 1994, students went on a hunger strike to
promote awareness of mistreatment against
farmworkers: I he use of deadly and known car
cinogenic pesticides on the fields, the payment of
wages under the living wage (around $10,000 a
year) and the growers' attempts to keep workers
from unionizing.
Although the original demands of the hunger
strikers called fora Univcrsitv-wide ban on
grapes, the I Diversity responded with a compro
mise deal that made the Office of Residential Ed
ucational <iikl the Dean of Student Affairs pri
marily responsible for grapes education.
We agree that the University has a commit
ment to educate students about labor issues that
are so vital to the prospei it\ of C lalifornia and, in
direc il\, to the prosperity of Stanford. I lowcvcr,
we find the c urrent s\stem of promoting aware
ness to be ineffec live.

l he University does not implement adequate
education. The Residential Education Web site
and grape link in computer clusters are useful ed
ucational tools, but many students don't know
enough to understand why they should use these
resources. Without an understanding of the im
pact of their decision, most students don't even
take the time to vote.
Ihe core responsibility of spreading awareness
has fallen on the shoulders of a group of dedicat
ed students each year. Those students, now the
( '■rape Coalition, organized informational ses
sions for every undergraduate dorm in the past
years. This year, they decided to try dilferent ways
of educating their peers, and the University did
not attempt to match the students' previous
efforts.
As a result of the University's inaction, most
of the freshmen and many of the upperclass
inen remain clueless about farm worker issues.
I lu-re has been little dialogue on these complex
topics. In addition, the Resident Assistants are
not sensitively trained and are expected to pur
sue the issue on their own time in order to be
able to answer their residents' questions and
concerns.
I here seems to be a general sense of apathy
towards tlu- grape issue on campus, which is re

fleeted in the declining number of voters each
year. In fact, there seems to be a backlash
against the human rights concerns of students
who support the boycott in the form of an out
cry to protect students' rights to eat an enjoy
able fruit.
This transformation indicates the need fora
fresh look at how the University should fulfill its
commitment to a social issue that is symbolic of
larger labor rights questions and which is so im
portant to the Chicano community on campus.
We propose that the University expand fresh
man education to include an informative pro
gram on California labor issues so that students
will see that grapes are not a falsely symbolic con
cern. 1 his push could be a part of orientation,
just as sex/substance abuse education and diver
sity training have become institutionalized with
productions like the "Real World" and "FACES
of the community."
Meanwhile, students must take a stance and
educate themselves on the issues, lake this op
portunity to honor the struggle of those first con
cerned students and recognize that, no matter
how Hawed the process, the only way to incite
change now is to vote. Voting begins November

commitment to a social issue that is symbolic of
larger labor rights questions and which is so im
portant to the Chicano community on campus.
We propose that the University expand fresh
man education to include an informative pro
gram on California labor issues so that students
will see that grapes are not a falsely symbolic con
cern. 1 his push could be a part of orientation,
just as sex/substance abuse education and diver
sity training have become institutionalized with
productions like the "Real World" and "FACES
of the community."
Meanwhile, students must take a stance and
educate themselves on the issues, lake this op
portunity to honor the struggle of those first con
cerned students and recognize that, no matter
how Hawed the process, the only way to incite
change now is to vote. Voting begins November
