# SALAD DAYS
## Down with the Electoral College 
### 
I watched I lit* election on 1 uesda\
night with friends in nn dorm. I
watched in amazement as A1 Gore's
national vote total kept rising into the
early morning hours.
"It was California. California put him
over the top!" somebodv t ailed out.
" 1 he numbers are showing (lore up bv
over a hundrcd-and-fifiv thousand votes!"
exclaimed somebody else.
How delightful it was to see that more
people voted for nn candidate than for the
other guy. Hut the jubilee on the third floor
of Soto quickly ended.
"So what happens il (iore still doesn't win

Fl< >rida?"
Cood question. I lie
answer is, of course, that
(ieorge W. Bush w ill be
come the next President
of the United States, de
spite the fact more peo
ple voted lor (lore. This
is not "fuzzy math;" this
is the Electoral (College.
The Electoral Col
lege is that thing von

learned about in eighth-grade civics and
then forgot. Il s like tonsils or an appendix.
It doesn't do am good and, from time to
time, it does something pi ft t \ unhealthv.
And, in ibis election, the Electoral College
may silence the voice of democracy.
It's time to gel rid of it.
Some people do not realize that every
one's vote does not count the same. Let me
say that again: If you live in a large state,
your vote does not count as nuu h as some
one who lives in a small state.
In Wyoming, a state with three electoral
votes, the voters got one elector in the Elec
toral College forever) 71,000 votes. In Cal
ifornia, it takes more than 180,000 voters to
get one elector! That means that a vote in
Wyoming counts at least twice as much as a
vote in California.
And that, once again, isn't fn/zv math.
Ilie fact that one person's vote counts
more than another person's is contrary to
the ideal of our democracy. It's nonsensical,
it's not helpful, it's arcane. It's just plain
wrong.
But the Electoral College system does not
randomly distort the popular vote. It's
much worse than that. Consider the fact that
A1 Gore received overwhelming support

from African-American and latino voters,
whereas (ieorge Bush received overwhelm
ing support Irom gun owners and religious
conservatives. Then consider the lad that
less populous stales like Wvoming, Idaho,
Montana. I tab. North Dakota and soon,
have a higher than average concentration of
gun owners and religious conservatives.
More populous states like ('.alilornia, Flori
da and New York, have a higher concentra
tion of Ali i< an-Americans and 1 lispanic s.
Ibis means ili.it the Electoral College
amplified the votes of gun owners and reli
gions conservatives, while diminishing the
votes <>l African-Americans and latinos.
Ibis is how \l Gore can beat George Bush
In hundreds ol thousands of votes, but not
win the election.
This is serious stulf. I he Electoral Col
lege has biased the results ol ibis national
election, and it biased the election against
minorities. It's almost enough to make me
think that the Electoral College was de
signed bv slave owners. ()h wait, il was.
I hear a lot ol people saying that the Elec
toral (College svstem w ill never be changed
because il would require a Constitutional
Amendment. I like to point out something
else is m the Constitution, the three-filihs
compromise. Slaves were to count as three
liftbsof a person, which, 1 suppose, was bel
ter than being two-sevenths of a person.
I'm not sure how the math works out ex
,k ilv, but the Electoral ( ollege brings about
something akin to that. Because Afncan-
Americans and I atinos tend to be found in
greater concentrations in bigger states, tliev
are underrepresented in the Electoral Col
lege. I'll call it a nine-tenths compromise.
But, in an election as close as this one, mi
norities should count as lull people, I think.
(Inn owners and religious conservatives
don't need any extra advantages, because
they've already got Charleton Heston on
their side. Anyone who watched on televi
sion as Bush's Red Sea spread over the mid
dle of the country on Tuesday will attest to
that.
The Electoral College needs to go, and it
needs to go right now. George Bush, in the
interest of true democracy, should concede
and /\1 Gore should be the next President of
the United States.
And Ralph Nader should fx- given a big
