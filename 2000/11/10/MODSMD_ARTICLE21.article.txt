Bad ballots and Green Party need to go
I lie* American public s desired election
outcome, the election ola left-leaning
president, is in jeopard\ .is .1 result of two
well-intentioned but int redibh misguided
ellorts.
I he first and most pressing is the egre
gious <md incompetent error on the part
ol Palm Heat h officials: In an attempt to
make ballots easier lor elderly voters to
read, oflicials actually treated a process
that systematically encouraged thousands
ol them it) misvote. I his misleading and
perhaps unconstitutional structure com
pletely warped the vote outcome in the
county and. as such, undoes the legitima
t \ of the Florida election.
If the problem is not remedied impar
tially via special election, statistical model
ing or some other fair and non-partisan
solution, it will undermine the national
election and the legitimacy and authority
of the federal government. This situation
demands the attention of "leaders of con
science" like Jimmy Carter and Bob Dole,
as well as newspaper editorial boards and
organizations like the League of Women
Voters, all of whom must rise above the

partisan fray and ensure that basic fairness
prevails.
I he second miscalculation occurred
months ago, when Ralph Nader and the
Green Party tlevised their campaign strat
egy. Perhaps 110 one ran the numbers, but
it strikes me that there simply are not
enough progressive voters in the nation to
ensure the survival of competing Demo
cratic and (ireen parties.
But rather than take steady aim at the
Republican Party and work with
Democrats, a massive number of whom
are outspoken progressives — almost a
third of the Democrats in the House be
long to the Progressive Caucus — to mo
bilize unengaged citizens. Nader and
company chose to take aim at Demtx rats,
campaign in hotly contested states and, in
Nader's words, "teach the Democratic
party a lesson" for Washington's centrist
policymaking.
The Congress and the president's cen
trist policies are not the result of the
Democratic Party's moderation, however.
They are the result primarily of intense
and protracted clashes between
Democrats on the left and Republicans on
the right. The Green Party needs a more

productive strategy, and Ralph Nader
needs to put aside his overabundant ego,
working with, rather than against, pro
gressive Democrats. If not, as a committed
and pragmatic progressive. I welcome
Naders political death and the Green
Party's demise.
