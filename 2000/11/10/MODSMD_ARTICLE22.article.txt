## The
						United States of America: Has our title become a misnomer? 
### ELISABETH PRESSER EDITORIAL STAFF 
The name ol our country de
scribes a set ol seperate bodies
banded together as ati alliance.
Yet, today, individual states
seem to be little more than geographic.il
designations demarcating .1 homogenous
group ol Americans spread over a very
large piece ol land.
The outcry against the Electoral Col
lege in recent days demonstrates the loss
of political significance lor the states. Why
can't a majority of Americans elect their
president, everyone seems to be asking.
I he system is disproportional and not

representative.
Well, at the lime of its inception, the
statis were meaningful political entities.
Each state was understood to have diller
ing priorities and concerns; the federal
government was formed to protect the in
terests of each slate as well as to facilitate
interaction between them. The Electoral
College 1 enforced the integrity of state
boundaries: Presidential candidates,
rather than ignoring the less populous
states, needed to seek the endorsement of
all the state units.
I he idea was that il the interests of a
state weren't adequately represented,
then il wouldn't be a true part of the
I nion.

Today, these designations don't seem
to make sense. People know far more
about their president than they know
about their senators, their mayors and
probably their spouses. Whatever fear we
might express about a strong central gov
ernment, we treat our local governments
as nominal and powerless figureheads.
We pour concentrated decision-making
power into the hands of the central gov
ernment and rail against states-rights ad
vocates as neglectful reactionaries.
It is no longer seen as valid to leave .1 de
cision in the hands of the states. Take abor
tion, tor example. If a politician does not
want to create federal legislation protect
ing abortion, we understand his or her po

sition to be against abortion rights. Either
something is federally protected, popular
opinion seems to believe, or it is illegal.
What do the stales count for? I lave we
readied such a level of homogeneity that
I hey are no longer necessary - ? Have Holly
wood, New York and Washington become
the sources of cultural values for any and
all Americans?
We need to rethink the meaning of the
I'nited States of America. II we are all one
people, with only one purpose and only
one viewpoint, then these nominal desig
nations should go, and we can leave .ill
legislation in the hands of the central
government.
But if regulation is best kept at .1 more

local level, and a group ol U(>o million in
dividuals can hold views and values that
diller IÂ»\ .t large decree, ihen we need to
preserve the system ol government that
was designed to protect diversity and
communitv.
II we choose to reform the American ic
publit into one vast federal regime, then
the (.011 slitution is going to need some se
rious amending. I nless ilus is done, we
need to understand and respect the struc
ture that allows us to li\e in one countn
with many different and largeh indepen
dent govei ning bodies.
