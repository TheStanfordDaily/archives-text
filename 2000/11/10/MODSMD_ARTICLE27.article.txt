# KZSU serves as training ground for future DJs
## 
### VAUHINI VARA 
In the basement of Memorial Audito
rium, down the lelt stairway, through
the door to the right, a student sits in a
small booth, controlling the broadcast of
a womens volleyball game. This is the
headquarters of KZSU, 90. I I NI, Stan
ford's official radio station.
Many students don I know about iliis
particular media outlet. Although it is
often criticized as being "too" indie
music focused, k/Sl boasts a large and
diverse library of music and is the only
media organization that broadcasts
every women's volleyball game, as well as
women's basketball and men's baseball.
Since the staff consists of community
members as well as Stanford students,
many KZSU disk jockies have been with
the station for several years. Some shows
have loyal listeners, such as "Blues with a
Keel in'," hosted by l)| Byrd, who lias
been with the station lor 10 years.
"lor some reason, all the hardware
stores listen to him," said the station's
general manager Selena Hsu.
However, seasoned aren't the
onl\ ones gaining a valuable experience
<ii KZSI ; . ()f the 90 or so people involved
in the station, about a third are students.
"It's great to have community involve

ment.'' Hsu said, "but at the same time,
it's cool to have kids working for the sta
tion who know what's happening on
campus."
To get involved, students submit an
application to be considered fora non
credit dass, which meets once a week for
aquarter. Because the facilities are small,
the dass is usually limited to about 15
members.
I his quarter, though, in an effort to
bring student participation back to
KZSU, the station has increased en
rollment to 35 students. After taking
the class, students take a test and sub
mit a tape in order to be broadcast on
air.
Although first-quarter DJs usually get
early morning shows, they are given reg
ular priority times alter the first quarter.
"1 he more time you put in, the more
chance you get at whatever you want,"
explained 1 Isu.
Like many of the students in the class,
I Isu arrived at KZSU as a freshman.
"Sophomore year, I started with an
old-school funk show, but then I started
learning more about other types of
music," she said. "People would always
be saying, 'I ley, you should try this out,'
or, 'Oh, these albums are really great,'
and eventually, I started listening to

more and more musit
Now, Hsu's show has evolved into'an
electronic showcase, informally named
Gimme Some Sauce. ()Hiciallv, it's called
"A girl and her thumping heats," and
plays from 4 p.m. to f> p.m. on Thurs
days. Besides Hsu's, there are I ( J other
shows on KZSI", usuallv two to three
hours long, once a week.
A glance at the program s< hedule oi
lers an idea of just how eclectic the- DJs
musical tastes are. Romain's Monday
morning "Mixed Ip (ilass'" show pre
sents "a tossed salad of classical music,'
according to the printed schedule.
Sutha's "Mostly Tamil" leatures Indian
pop; DJ Gristle plays goth; Kathryn's
"Unnecessary Sun Kxposure," leatures
indie pop and rock.
In addition to their chosen program
ming, DJs are also required to plav I I
tracks per show from a shelf railed the A-
File — the musical Mecca of all things
indie.
To get on the A-File, the 100-plus al
bums received via mail ever) week must
p.iss a review In the station's musi( (li
re* tor. After surviving the initial inspec -
tion. ( Ds are unleashed onto the A-Tile,
accompanied bv .t short review In a
k/.SI DJ.
A quick shuflle through the albums

on the A-Kile is <<11 it takes to recognize
that KZSL is far from top 40.
"The philosophy is that there are
commercial stations that play main
stream stuff," explained Hsu. "As a col
lege station with a pretty small budget,
we trv to play stuff that people can't hear
anywhere else."
And they do ii well, with an indie se
lection as diverse as ii is expansive (The
station currently owns almost 100,000 al
bums.) Hsu points out an album called
"labia Beat Science," which throws elec
tronic beats over Indian labia percus
sion. I here are a few scream-rock
records, like the Blood Brothers's "This
Adultery is Ripe," and quite a bit of
punk, including Avail's "One Wrench,"
and the last girl-rock of the Roolies's
"Blame it on the Roolies." And then
there's the stuff in between, including
country-inlluenced rock and rock-inllu
enced jazz.
On a campus that leans musically to
the middle of the road, KZSU's work
often goes unnoticed.
"I don't listen to them much because
they don't publicize ver\ often," said se
nior Ciabe La/.arin. "Also, the station
doesn't seem to have much of a relation
ship with the student bod), which is why
we don't listen.'

I lie station is trving to < lunge that at
titude this year. In an effort to bring the
music back to the student bod\. KZSI is
participating in issues ol interest to the
students. The station broadcast I niver
sity President John Hennessv s inaugu
ration a lew weeks ago, as well as Ralph
Nader s sold-out appearance .it Memor
ial Auditorium.
Every spring, the\ host a big part\ .it
Lambda Nu; this year, they hope to hold
more. Currently, they're wot king on
bringing bands to the Knchanlcd Broc
coli Forest's happ) hour.
Since KZSI is a volunteer, non-profit
organization, explained Hsu, it needs all
the help it (.111 get to stav on its leet.
"What would l>e great is 11101 e student
support," she said. "1 here are definiteh
interested people 011 campus who lisien
to the music, like the shows . . . but .1 lot
of the time, people aren't necessai ih 111-
terested in independent music.
According to I Isu, "C)ur mission is to
share the music with evervone else —
not just to satisfy 0111 own big heads."
Despite the gre.iih divergent tastes ol
individual l)|s, the\ seem to share an
ideology as to what the si at ion's all about.
As Hsu puts it, "People who love
music just come together and bust
loose."

we trv to play stuff that people can't hear
anywhere else."
And they do ii well, with an indie se
lection as diverse as ii is expansive (The
station currently owns almost 100,000 al
bums.) Hsu points out an album called
"labia Beat Science," which throws elec
tronic beats over Indian labia percus
sion. I here are a few scream-rock
records, like the Blood Brothers's "This
Adultery is Ripe," and quite a bit of
punk, including Avail's "One Wrench,"
and the last girl-rock of the Roolies's
"Blame it on the Roolies." And then
there's the stuff in between, including
country-inlluenced rock and rock-inllu
enced jazz.
On a campus that leans musically to
the middle of the road, KZSU's work
often goes unnoticed.
"I don't listen to them much because
they don't publicize ver\ often," said se
nior Ciabe La/.arin. "Also, the station
doesn't seem to have much of a relation

we don't listen.'

Since KZSI is a volunteer, non-profit
organization, explained Hsu, it needs all
the help it (.111 get to stav on its leet.
"What would l>e great is 11101 e student
support," she said. "1 here are definiteh
interested people 011 campus who lisien
to the music, like the shows . . . but .1 lot
of the time, people aren't necessai ih 111-
terested in independent music.
According to I Isu, "C)ur mission is to
share the music with evervone else —
not just to satisfy 0111 own big heads."
Despite the gre.iih divergent tastes ol
individual l)|s, the\ seem to share an
ideology as to what the si at ion's all about.
As Hsu puts it, "People who love
music just come together and bust
loose."
In the basement of Memorial Audito
rium, down the lelt stairway, through
the door to the right, a student sits in a
small booth, controlling the broadcast of
a womens volleyball game. This is the
headquarters of KZSU, 90. I I NI, Stan
ford's official radio station.
Many students don I know about iliis
particular media outlet. Although it is
often criticized as being "too" indie
music focused, k/Sl boasts a large and
diverse library of music and is the only
media organization that broadcasts
every women's volleyball game, as well as
women's basketball and men's baseball.
Since the staff consists of community
members as well as Stanford students,
many KZSU disk jockies have been with
the station for several years. Some shows
have loyal listeners, such as "Blues with a
Keel in'," hosted by l)| Byrd, who lias
been with the station lor 10 years.
"lor some reason, all the hardware
stores listen to him," said the station's
general manager Selena Hsu.
However, seasoned aren't the
onl\ ones gaining a valuable experience
<ii KZSI ; . ()f the 90 or so people involved
in the station, about a third are students.
"It's great to have community involve

ment.'' Hsu said, "but at the same time,
it's cool to have kids working for the sta
tion who know what's happening on
campus."
To get involved, students submit an
application to be considered fora non
credit dass, which meets once a week for
aquarter. Because the facilities are small,
the dass is usually limited to about 15
members.
I his quarter, though, in an effort to
bring student participation back to
KZSU, the station has increased en
rollment to 35 students. After taking
the class, students take a test and sub
mit a tape in order to be broadcast on
air.
Although first-quarter DJs usually get
early morning shows, they are given reg
ular priority times alter the first quarter.
"1 he more time you put in, the more
chance you get at whatever you want,"
explained 1 Isu.
Like many of the students in the class,
I Isu arrived at KZSU as a freshman.
"Sophomore year, I started with an
old-school funk show, but then I started
learning more about other types of
music," she said. "People would always
be saying, 'I ley, you should try this out,'
or, 'Oh, these albums are really great,'
and eventually, I started listening to

more and more musit
Now, Hsu's show has evolved into'an
electronic showcase, informally named
Gimme Some Sauce. ()Hiciallv, it's called
"A girl and her thumping heats," and
plays from 4 p.m. to f> p.m. on Thurs
days. Besides Hsu's, there are I ( J other
shows on KZSI", usuallv two to three
hours long, once a week.
A glance at the program s< hedule oi
lers an idea of just how eclectic the- DJs
musical tastes are. Romain's Monday
morning "Mixed Ip (ilass'" show pre
sents "a tossed salad of classical music,'
according to the printed schedule.
Sutha's "Mostly Tamil" leatures Indian
pop; DJ Gristle plays goth; Kathryn's
"Unnecessary Sun Kxposure," leatures
indie pop and rock.
In addition to their chosen program
ming, DJs are also required to plav I I
tracks per show from a shelf railed the A-
File — the musical Mecca of all things
indie.
To get on the A-File, the 100-plus al
bums received via mail ever) week must
p.iss a review In the station's musi( (li
re* tor. After surviving the initial inspec -
tion. ( Ds are unleashed onto the A-Tile,

A quick shuflle through the albums

on the A-Kile is <<11 it takes to recognize
that KZSL is far from top 40.
"The philosophy is that there are
commercial stations that play main
stream stuff," explained Hsu. "As a col
lege station with a pretty small budget,
we trv to play stuff that people can't hear
anywhere else."
