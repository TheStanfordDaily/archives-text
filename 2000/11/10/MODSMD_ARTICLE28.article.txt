## Senior legacy hangs in balance vs. Devils 
### MATT LONG STAFF WRITER 
It's now all about the seniors for the Stanford loot
ball team. Postseason glory is out of the question with
last weekend's 37-35 loss at UCI A, so the only gift the
Cardinal can give to its elder players is two more vic -
tories.
Arizona State and the annual blood match with
California are all that remain in 2000 for Stanford (3-
6, 2-4 Pacific 10 Conference), and gift wrapping the
Sun Devils (5-4, 2-4) on Saturday at home would
boost the Cardinal's morale as Pig Came draws near.
"()ur seniors don't have next year," said Stanford
head coach Tyrone Willingham. "What we have to do
for them is win right now. 1 think they would feel
good about their program, and believe that's the right
approach and the right attitude to take in anything
that we do. That has been a foundation for me. I be
lieve the most important thing we do is what we do
today."
The Sun Devils are hungry, as one more win will

allow them to revel in a postseason bowl game. But
that win has not come easy, as Arizona State is coining
oil its third consecutive overtime game, an NCA\
record. Saturday the Sun Devils fell to I SCI 44-38 in
double overtime.
"This is a football team that, 1 guess in some re
gards, is going through avers similar dillic nil time .is
we are," said Willingham. "I iliink I can use the word
difficult, because they've been in a number of close
ballgames, and 1 can't say that those games have
worked in their favor."
Arizona State boasts the Pac-10's best passing of
fense, which Stanford's struggling secondary will
need to contain in order to challenge the Sun 1 )e\ ils.
Redshirt freshman Jeff krohn has compiled most of
Arizona State's passing yardage, but three other quar
terbacks have also contributed. Krohn left the I St
game with an injury and is questionable against the
(cardinal, opening the door for senior backup (Iriflin
Goodwin.

Pasadena, Calif. The loss dropped the Cardinal from bowl contention.
I he Sun Devil receiving corps is led by All-Pac-1()
light end I odd Heap, a junior dubbed the "golden
retriever" by his teammates on account of his flaxen
hair and ama/ing ability to get to the lootball.
Stanford starting quarterbac, redshirt junior
Randy Fasani <tlso sat out the end of last weekend's
game because of .in aggravated knee injury, but is ex
pected to be ready for the Sun Devil defense. Fasani's
tender knee has made redshirt freshman Chris Lewis
a familiar face to the (Cardinal faithful, and should see
playing time as well, if only to give Fasani a chance to
rest his knee.
Stanford senior wideout Deßonnie Pitts needs
only five receptions to move into second place on the
Pac-10 career list and leads a talented senior class that
has the opportunity to break several records.
Linebacker Riall Johnson's three sacks against
I CIA kept him at the top of the Pac-10 and also gave
him a chance to break the Stanford record of I 7.

All-Ainerican defensive lineman Willie Howard
can also achieve a remarkable feat by starting the next
two games. If he does so, the self-avowed leader of the
"Trench Dogs" will have started every game of his
collegiate career.
But records are inconsequential to this driven
group, and winning is their ultimate goal.
"The seniors think the same way I think," Howard
said. "There's nothing more sweet than to go out
there and win the last two. at least."
To win, Stanford will need receivers other than
Pitts to step up and make big plays. Against UCLA,
redshirt sophomore Luke Powell had a career-high
149 yards. To draw the double team off Pitts, he will
need to pose a similar threat to Arizona State's pass
defense. The Sun Devils' secondary is anchored by
senior cornerback Nijrell Eason, a candidate for ihe
Jim Thorpe Award, given annually to the nation's
best defensive back.
In the end, Stanford just needs to reach the end
/one. Ihe Cardinal ranks last in the conference in
scoring, and regardless of who moves the chains, it
takes touchdowns to win ballgames.
