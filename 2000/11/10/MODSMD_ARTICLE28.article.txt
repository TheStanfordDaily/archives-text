## Senior legacy hangs in balance vs. Devils 
### MATT LONG STAFF WRITER 
It's now all about the seniors for the Stanford loot
ball team. Postseason glory is out of the question with
last weekend's 37-35 loss at UCI A, so the only gift the
Cardinal can give to its elder players is two more vic -
tories.
Arizona State and the annual blood match with
California are all that remain in 2000 for Stanford (3-
6, 2-4 Pacific 10 Conference), and gift wrapping the
Sun Devils (5-4, 2-4) on Saturday at home would
boost the Cardinal's morale as Pig Came draws near.
"()ur seniors don't have next year," said Stanford
head coach Tyrone Willingham. "What we have to do
for them is win right now. 1 think they would feel
good about their program, and believe that's the right
approach and the right attitude to take in anything
that we do. That has been a foundation for me. I be
lieve the most important thing we do is what we do
today."
The Sun Devils are hungry, as one more win will

allow them to revel in a postseason bowl game. But
that win has not come easy, as Arizona State is coining
oil its third consecutive overtime game, an NCA\
record. Saturday the Sun Devils fell to I SCI 44-38 in
double overtime.
"This is a football team that, 1 guess in some re
gards, is going through avers similar dillic nil time .is
we are," said Willingham. "I iliink I can use the word
difficult, because they've been in a number of close
ballgames, and 1 can't say that those games have
worked in their favor."
Arizona State boasts the Pac-10's best passing of
fense, which Stanford's struggling secondary will
need to contain in order to challenge the Sun 1 )e\ ils.
Redshirt freshman Jeff krohn has compiled most of
Arizona State's passing yardage, but three other quar
terbacks have also contributed. Krohn left the I St
game with an injury and is questionable against the
(cardinal, opening the door for senior backup (Iriflin
Goodwin.
