)list a lew thousand steps stand between
the Stanford harriers and the Nov. 20 \( '.AA
Championships in Ames, lowa. The Cardi
nal squad plans in make (]iiit k work ol those
final paces tomorrow morning as it runs in
the Western Regional Championships in
Fresno, ( alii.
Call it a run-through, a 10-kilometer
warm-up for the real thing. But the fact re
mains that to secure a spot at the national
meet, No. 2 Stanford must claim either Hist

or second plate in tomorrow's race. And
even though the Cardinal lias soundly de
feated every team it lias faced in the region
this year, no team is going to hand victory
over to the (Cardinal.
"It will be a tight race with several teams ag
gressively seeking a qualifying spot tor the
NCAAs," said head coach Vin Lananna. "I ex
pect that both (No. 12) Arizona and (No. 10)
Oregon will race very well."
Those teams are the only ranked competi
tors Stanford will face. Stanford drubbed both
in the Pacific 10 Conference meet two weeks
ago.

I lie race could turn into a dogfight, howev
er, .is teams battle lor the 13 at-large bids of
fered to top-performing teams across the na
tion. Because bids are given largely as a reward
lor defeating highly-ranked teams, it will be im
portant for Stanford to run strategically. The
team cannot afford to be distracted by what
promises to be a chaotic team battle surround
ing them.
"If we can keep our cool and race under con
trol we will have very good performances,"
Lananna said.
