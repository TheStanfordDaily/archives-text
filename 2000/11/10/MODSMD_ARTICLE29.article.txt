)list a lew thousand steps stand between
the Stanford harriers and the Nov. 20 \( '.AA
Championships in Ames, lowa. The Cardi
nal squad plans in make (]iiit k work ol those
final paces tomorrow morning as it runs in
the Western Regional Championships in
Fresno, ( alii.
Call it a run-through, a 10-kilometer
warm-up for the real thing. But the fact re
mains that to secure a spot at the national
meet, No. 2 Stanford must claim either Hist

or second plate in tomorrow's race. And
even though the Cardinal lias soundly de
feated every team it lias faced in the region
this year, no team is going to hand victory
over to the (Cardinal.
"It will be a tight race with several teams ag
gressively seeking a qualifying spot tor the
NCAAs," said head coach Vin Lananna. "I ex
pect that both (No. 12) Arizona and (No. 10)
Oregon will race very well."
Those teams are the only ranked competi
tors Stanford will face. Stanford drubbed both
in the Pacific 10 Conference meet two weeks
ago.

I lie race could turn into a dogfight, howev
er, .is teams battle lor the 13 at-large bids of
fered to top-performing teams across the na
tion. Because bids are given largely as a reward
lor defeating highly-ranked teams, it will be im
portant for Stanford to run strategically. The
team cannot afford to be distracted by what
promises to be a chaotic team battle surround
ing them.
"If we can keep our cool and race under con
trol we will have very good performances,"
Lananna said.
Lananna has traditionally used
the Regional meet — one ol the
lew 10-kilometer races the team
runs during the season — to de
termine his lineup and strategy
lot the NCAA meet ol the same
distance.
I his year's plan looks to he the
same, ;is the preliminary lineup ol'
Hi will have to he shaved to seven
hv rate time.
"We're still in the process ol se
lecting our best lineup lor the
N( IAVs," Lananna said. "The Re
gional meet will give us an oppor
tunity to prepare many athletes
lor helping us take a shot at win

ning the N( ,A\ ( ham pit>nships.
"We need a solid group of
seven athletes that can execute
the ra< e plan with confidence and
excitement, and the Regional
meet will allow us to prat lice
that."
Senior co-captains Jonathon
Rilcv and I homas Murle\ are sale
bets lor tomorrow's lineup, as is
redshirt freshman Louis Lut hini.
I li.it trio will be joined In lour
more runners, selected Irom a
pool including redshirt freshmen
Andrew llill ,md (Irani Robison,
sophomores Selh 111*|n\ - , Adam
Lenlorde and Antly Powell and
juniors Jesse I liomas and Daniel
Pan is.
Freshmen Don Sage and lan
Dobsoti may also see work on the

trails tomorrow.
Ihe si.mis ol junior (labe Jen
nings m.i\ be the onl\ i ertainty in
the lineup. I lie 2000 Olvmpian
has opted to lake the quarter off
to lully recover from Ins long
I rat k season and w ill not race for
the cross rountn team ilus sea
sou. lie was fourth .it this meet
last year.
(iomingoll .i victors al the Pac
-10 ineel, Rile\ is the odds-on fa
vorite, though \lmle\ has proven
strong over the 10-kilometer dis
tance. I he two finished sixth and
seventh last veai. respectively.
()regon's Jason I laritnann,
who challenged Riley two weeks
ago, should ,ilso be strong.
Phe race is scheduled to begin
al I I a.m.
