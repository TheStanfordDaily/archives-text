ol reported voter irregularities. Palm Beach
and Volusia counties have agreed to the re
count, and Broward County has scheduled a

The Gore campaign is also prepared to
take the matter to court.
"II the will of the people is to prevail, Al
Gore should be awarded a vic tory in Florida
and be our next president," said Gore cam

paign chairman William Daley.
Subjects of complaint include a ballot thai
some Palm Beach (lountv residents sav made
them think I hey were voting for Gore when
they were really punching the ballot for Re
form Party candidate Pat Buchanan.
Buchanan received more than 3,000 voles
in Palm Beach County, approximately 20
percent of his tally for the entire state.
Buchanan himself said he doubts .ill the votes
he received iti Palm Beach (lounty were truly
meant for him. Nonetheless, lie said he op
posed a revolt 1 , as he believes it would be un
fairly biased toward Gore.
Bush campaign officials pointed to the fact

that tlit- ballot in question, which is called a
butterfly ballot, was approved by a Democrat
ic Florida voting official.
"The ballot that was used in Palm Beach
County was prepared by the election authori
ties in that county, who are led by an elected
Democrat," Bush campaign strategist Karl
Rove said at a press conference yesterday.
"Democrats designed the ballot, Democrats
ran the Klection Day, Democrats led the count
of the ballot."

tory in Florida, said Karen Hughes, cam-

paign communications director.
