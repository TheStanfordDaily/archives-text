# Hockey charges into NCAAs as West's best
## 
### EMILY ST. THOMAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The tournament bracket lor the NCAA
Field Hockev Championships looks preth
typical. The perennial powerhouses such .is
()id Dominion and Maryland occupy the
top spots, with the usual northeast teams
rounding out the seedings. But field hocke)
no longer slops at the Mississippi River.
A 2-0 win against California in the North
ern Pacific (lonTerence Championship last
weekend gave Stanford a chance to play
Holy Cross lor a tournament berth. After
shutting out the Crusaders I uesda\ in
Worcester, Mass., Stanford (111-10, 4-2

Northern Pacific Conference) is now on iis
wa\ to represent the West (and pretty much
everywhere but the Northeast), in the
NCAAs.
The last time the Cardinal made a trip to
the Kast Coast, it came back disappointed
with its level of play but ready to make some
changes. Since then, the Cardinal has lost
only one game, and ibis Kast Coast trip is
looking much more promising than the last.
Tuesday afternoon, both Stanford and
llol\ Cross (14-7) had everything to lose,
and the (Irusaders held the clear advantage.
Foreshadowing this weekend's oppo
nents, Holy (Toss' offense posed a bigger
threat to the Stanford defense than the (lar

dinal was used to. The number of shots on
go.il was practically even, 1 M) slightly in
favor of Stanford.
Junior forward Erica Swesey ended the
lie with just over a minute and a half to play
in regulation, scoring off a pass from
sophomore defender Christina Williams.
Swesey, now the team's leading scorer,
has stepped up her play in the postseason.
Din ing the first round of the NorPac cham
pionship versus St. Louis, she recorded two
goals and four assists during the 7-0 shutout.
Swesey tallied her third goal of the champi
onship in the final match against Cal.
Stanford had only one close call in the
game against Holy Cross, when Crusader
senior captain Kim Ferguson missed a
penalty stroke. Stanford junior goalie Re
becca Shapiro reached a career-high 120
saves after recording three more in the
game.
The tournament bracket for the NCAAs
was announced Wednesday afternoon and
the Cardinal was seeded 16th out of 16
teams. They will face top-ranked Old Do
minion (21-1) in Norfolk, Va., the site of the
Final Four, tomorrow at 1 1 a.m. EST.
I he last time the Cardinal played a team
ranked No. 1 in the nation was earlier this
season when it faced Maryland in the mid
dle of its East Coast trip. The same was ar
guably the low point of Stanford's season as
Maryland shutout the Cardinal 8-0.
()ld Dominion's only loss this season was
also to Maryland, 5-4 in double overtime.
Stanford will have to concentrate on the
strong points of its game, the passing and
communication on the field, in order to be
competitive Saturday morning.
While Old Dominion will be looking for
its ninth national championship, Stanford
will be making only its seventh appearance
in the NCAA tournament. The last time the
Cardinal made it to NCAAs was in 1005
when it lost, 5-0 to Penn State.
I he winner of that game will advance to
the second round to face either Connecti
cut or Virginia.
