last-mo and freeze-fraint's,
. along with a lew obligatory


'70s-style split-screen shots. Fur
ther inundating the senses are the
40 or so song snippets (most with
"Angel" in the title — get it?) that
are ( rammed into the soundtrack.
The plot — something about
rescuing voice-recognition soli
ware from evil (lot w in's empire so
that cell-phone privacy can be
maintained — is completely lost in
the hvper-kinetic muddle, but it
reallv doesn't matter when vou're
pitching your wares to .in audi

Deficit Disorder.
M< (> is at his best orchestrating
the fight scenes between the An
gels and a silent Cot win crony
known only as the Weird Thin
Man (played by Crispin "George
McFly" Glover, in his creepiest
role since jim Jarmusch's "Dead
Man"). "Matrix"-style music starts
pumping, and you know the An
gels are about to kirk some Weird
Thin ass. Thin Man stops vogue
ing with a cigarette long enough to
fend off the Angels' aerial attacks
— and he has the uncanny ability
to not only survive their persistent
abuse, but also to furtively snatch
locks of their hair to satisfy his
bizarre fetish (why anyone would
want to suck on Lucy Liu's hair, I
just don't know).
Fight choreographer Yuen
Gheung-Yan (brother of "The

Matrix" choreographer Yuen
Woo-l'ing) deserves much of the
credit for the Angels' inventive
and styli/.ed acrobatics, though,
from all accounts, Ang Lee's and
Woo-Ping's forthcoming
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Drag
on" will become the new tom b
stone for martial art chic and
kung-fu cool.
Mc( i also toes the line between
high-tech 21st century gizmos and
low-tech 70s anachronisms with
some success: the Angels chew on
molars that double as wireless
voice transmitters, yet Charlie
(John Forsythe, as in the original
TV show) still communicates via a
dated desktop speaker. At another
point, the Angels bypass "retinal
scanners" and gel fingerprint
readers in order to rescue, ahem,
"software" from a "mainframe
computer." In an amusing se
quence, Diaz then slithers into a
white, hooded body suit and sub
sequently backllips around like a
drunken sperm so that she can
elude further lasers and sensors.
Drop the smirking references
to the silly 70s, and "Charlie's An
gels" is no better than a low-bud
get "Mission Impossible." Drop
the explosions and kung-fu krazi
ness, and it's no better than "Coy
ote Ugly." Drop the sex appeal,
and, well, we won't consider that.
