Full Monty." Yes, "Billy" is just as
good - if not better - as its crowd
pleasing, life-reaffirming mes
sage plays well to audiences and
critics alike.
Set in the 19N0s, "Billy" features
a virtually unknown cast and crew,

although the plot is quite familiar.
It's .t classic underdog ston chroni
cling the struggles of Bilh Elliot (be
lievably pla\'ed b\ |amie Bell) a
youthful British lad who preleis
ballet to boxing. Ills dad ((iarv
Lewis) is the stern lather figure on
strike from his mining job, and his
brother (Jamie 1 )raven) is following
in his father's

footsteps.
Hie proceed
ings ol the plot
are not the sur
prise here.
Rather, it is the
remarkable re
straint that di~

rector Stephen Daldry lias used as
he details the 1 1-year-old's
progress with poignant detail.
Working off Lee Hall's clever
script, Daldry makes good use of
Bell's dancing experience to craft a
gem that towers over this year's

mediocre offerings.
l\vo things that ( aught me <>11-
guard were the language and sex
ual undertones. This R-rated fea
ture has lots of blokes spouting
profanity, from Dad on down to
little Billy and his friends. Even
Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Wallers),
the local ballet instructor, is
sharp-tongued in avoiding inti
inate contact with her cheating
husband.
('.lose relationships also were a
surprise. Mrs. Wilkinson is so in
volved with Hilly that he even
questions — perhaps jokingly
her intentions. Even more,
Michael (Stuart Wells) takes a
deep liking to Hilly, thus pushing
the story closer toward the stereo
type of male ballet dancers.
"Hilly" is a heart-warming
charmer, but it is by no means
perfect. Along with the odd use of
adult themes, the movie does

have its slow moments. Neverthe
less, I suggest you make time to
see this film in the midst of

midterms and projects, as "Billy"
is a fine way to relieve stress and
agony.
