# Bruce Campbell takes on the film industry, Stanford and Intermission editor Jung Lah. Who's laughing now?
## ‘Come get some!’ 
### JUNG LAH EDITORIAL STAFF 
"I'm a character actor trapped
in a leading-man's body," declared
Bruce Campbell, self-proclaimed
B-movie actor and star of the ( las
sie ( iilt horror films that make up
the "Evil Dead" trilogy. Campbell,
who went on to star in the short
lived television Western "1 he .Ad
ventures of Brisco County Jr." as
well the ollbeat period show " Jack
ol All Trades." admits to having
been typecast as a horror / sci-fi
character actor, and his roles in
low-budget films and short stints
on FV shows like "I'he X-Files"
,ind "Xena: Warrior Princess" only
continue to establish this label. I lis
tongue-in-cheek humor and sell
knowing sarcasm are fiercely
adored by his small but loyal fan
base, and mam Stanford admirers
of Bruce Campbell came out to
show their support for his on-cam
piis appearance last week.
On Halloween night, the Stan
lord Film Society held a screening
of "Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn" in
( aibberley Auditorium. I lie event
was co-sponsored by the ASS I.'
Speakers Bureau and the C.radu
ate Student ('.ouniil.
There was no denying the ex
citement of the crowd as ('.amphcll
walked out on state to introduce
the movie. He was greeted by a
standing ovation, and he proceed
ed to raffle off signed VI IS and
DVD copies of the "Evil Dead"
films before settling into the- audi
ence himself to watch the movie.
Making an occasional wisecrack or
two during the screening, he then

spent a good hour answering ques
tions from the crowd iu addition to
signing autographs for anyone
willing to wait in line. There is no
denying Campbell's appeal — he
is a genuinely nice guy who truly
appreciates his fans, and that's why
they love him like the one-handed,
chainsaw-wielding destroyer of
Deadites that he really is. Intermis
sion got the opportunity to sit
down with Bruce "Ash" Campbell
and ask him about bis work, the in
dustry and politics. I lere's what he
had to say.
Intermission: What's your opinion
about the < iill following that has
sprung up around the "Evil 1 )ead"
movies?
Bruce Campbell: I think it's great
that someone likes something
enough that they're going to watch
it over and over and over and
never get tired of it. That 's a good
sign. I have a theory that movies
that are hard to make are easy to
watch, and movies that are easv to
make are hard to watch, because
vou're not really putting enough
effort into it. We busted our ass on
all three of the "Evil Dead films,
and I think it shows.
Wlietliet you like the movies or
not. at least we worked hard.
There are plenty of people who do
not like those movies, and there are
plenty of people who should not
see those movies. You know, like all
the Scandinavians.
Kut really, I'm pleased that peo
ple like them. And I can trace my
every advance as an actor based on
what those movies provided foi me
as far as opportunities.

I: Which of the "Evil Dead" films
did you most enjoy working on?
BC: Probably part two because we
had enough mone\ to do it right,
we had enough experience to be
able to be better filmmakers, and
not enough studio intervention to
make it a nightmare.
I: So "Army of Darkness" had a lot
of studio intervention?
BC: It had a lot, yeah. We had to
reshoot the ending and we had to
recut the film. The original version
was 9(> minutes and what came out
was 81 minutes.
It wasn't playing that well to test
audiences, and they base every
thing on those stores. Hie shorter
they made [the movie], the

higher the stores were, so
the) just kept shortening it.
There's an element of truth
in that. In what I tall a dum
dum movie, which is "Army
of Darkness,'' we tut out
mostly the battle footage at
the end.
They would ask, "But it
you have six skeletons blow
ing up, why not just have
three? YVhv do you have to
have six?" So it was imnossi-

ble for us to defend the movie
when it i ante time to edit, flic stu
dios would say,"(ait that out," and
we could nevei argue, "hut that's
integral to the plot." And that was
our own shortcoming.
I: So they'd cut it even if you spent
mone\ 011 making the scenes?
BC: They don't give a shit. V'ou
know, whatever the comment
cards said, tested audiences scored
it low. fhat's what matters in the
end.
I: Do you think you'll ever have the
kind ol freedom that you had with
"Evil Dead 2" again?

liC: Yeah — "Jack of All Trades." 1
was one of the exec producers so
they sort of tailored it for me. My
main goal was to get these two writ
ers I'd worked with on "Hercules"
and "Xena" that I thought
matched m\ sensibilities for that
genre. So we brought them on
board. We'd shot a bunch of stuff in
New Zealand and 1 was very famil
iar with New Zealand, so we decid
ed to do it there. After you've been
in television long enough, you
don't have to audition. At that
point, I'd ah ead) done "Hercules'"
and "Xena" for live years so I
didn't have to prove anything to
anybody. It was totally hands-olf,
and we had total creative control.
Good or bad, success or failure,
that's why I was happy to do that
show, because we could do am
thing we wanted. It was the perfe< t
creative situation, which was whv I
was willing to go to the frickin'
Southern Hemisphere to do it. lie
cause after a while, you've got to go
where you can do your work. As lai
as that show's concerned, though. I
just finished m\ first season and m\
last season. September 23rd, it just

got cancelled. Which is line. Rat
ings determine everything. Every
single show gets cancelled because
of low ratings — there's almost no
other reason.
I: Any chance it'll be picked up
again?
BC: No, because old TV shows
age like fish. No one wants to be
associated with television that's
been canceled.
I: Can you talk a little about being
t\ pet <ist as .in actor?
BC: An actor just wants to be an
actor. I've done a bunch of genre
stuff that's directly related to the
first "Kvil Dead" movie. You've
been in ,t couple of horror films so
it's like, "Let's get that gin who
does horror films." It's exciting at
first — I did some genre movies,
inosth science fiction, mostly hor
ror, and you fall into that trap. You
can either embrace it 01 fight
against it or do a little of both. It
helps you in that it you get in some
thing successful, you'll be known
lor something.
lint you also run the risk of
being stuck there. I have a lot of re
spect lor people like Sean (lonnery
a whole young generation
doesn't even know he was in the
bond films. It's an ama/ing thing
to overcome. Harrison Ford got
over the Indiana Jones thing and
the Stat Wars thing. But that's
pretty rare.
Reporters and news organiza
tions love to write "best known
loi." Everyone tries to get a handle
on "what is that person best known
loir" I hope I'm never best known
lot anything.
I: But do you think that you're best
known foi something?
BC.: Oil sure, the "Kvil Dead"
movies. And 1 have no problem
with that.
I: How did working on television
change your perception as a movie
actor?
BC: More people will see a low
rated television show in one night
than a whole run of a successful
movie. Even "Brisco County." I
found tli,it when I started to go to
conventions after that, a whole new
batch of people showed up. Not
the tattooed, spiked-haired, "Evil
Dead" goth crowd. It was little Billy
dressed as.»cowboy and a little girl
who owned a horse and wanted to
talk about horses. It was all a fami
ly thing. You're coming into their
homes lot free, and it allows you to
reach a whole new fan base.
1: So do you think you'd want more
of that type of greater recognition?

BC: Well, I'd hate to be a Tom
Cruise type where you have to
wear a disguise just to go to a
movie. They steal your kids. Weird
shit can happen.
I: So you'tl rather work in smaller
pictures?
BC.: I think it depends on tin- oi
lers. Some actors never want to
turn down work. But you have to
assert yourselfat some point. If you
don't say no, you lose all respect.
Fear drives you not to say it earlier
in your career. It's a big fear.
I: How does a career-minded ap
proach ailed the making of a pic -
ture?
BC: Producers put the project to
gether; they want it to be successful.
I'll give you a c lassic example. I have
a lot of respect for Frank Darabont
who did the movie "The Shaw
shank Redemption," a period
prison movie based on a Stephen
King novel. His lilm after that was
" I he (ireen Mile." A period prison
movie based on a Stephen King
novel. And you go, "Wow!' I mean,
that was a no-brainer.
Agents are involved in that sort
ol thing because they know they
can set it up. II you see something
come down the pipes and you go,
"Frank can nail that!" it's that sort
of inentalih where you might .is
well make the same movie.
Producers are gniliv because
they want a sure thing. They know
the studio will greenlight it it von
can get a I larrison Ford. So I lan i
son keeps saying no, so you keep
upping his price.
I've talked to some actors that
wind up in a project and you go.
"So how'd you end up on this
thing?" and tliev say, "Oh, I just
kept saying no and they just kept
raising the pi ice until I couldn't sav
no anymore."
An actor must take certain re
sponsibilities because if they say yes
to the same thing over and over
and over again, either they like it or
they're idiots In Hollywood, per
ception is nine-tenths the law.
Whatever you are perceived as is
who you are. Fhe trick is to keep
changing these perceptions.
I: Can you talk about this type of
stereoty ping within the industry ?
B( 1: Well, there's only about ten big
name actors out there now. And in
many cases, the agency that repre
sents them will represent the direc -
tors and the writers, and they'll
package it whether it's tight fin-
Brad Pitt or not.
It's this whole Hollywood ap
proach where you go, "Well I don't
give a shit, Michelle Pfeiffer is in
the same agency that's represent
ing the writer and the producer
and the director," so they say,
"Let's all keep it together!" and
then they approach the studio and
go, "Ah? Ah? Look .it that pack
age!" and the studio goes," I ley, we

don't have to do anything!" And
then it's sold. And that's kind of
liovv it works.
I: So is this the prototypical big stu
dio approach?
BC: In big studios, people get
weird because there's so much
money at stake, fake ;i movie like
"Die Hard." He's gonna get tin
had guy. You can't have those '70s
types of endings where the had guy
gets away, and the hero's lying
there bleeding in the gutter.
A friend of mine co-wrote the
movie " The Rookie" with Clint
Fastwooel. And in the original
draft, Clint gets killed at the end.
Fhe studio executives are going,
"Are you out of your fucking
mind? You (.111 wound him, you
can maim him, do whatever, but
you're not killing him. Don't even
show that to (Hint. (lause he'll like
it.' So they'll make decisions that
are based on inone\ because the)
want a possibility ola sequel. II In
dies, you can't have it.
hi "Von Ryan's Kxpress,"
Frank Sinatra is running lor the
train at the end and a plane just
comes and guns him down. And
it's like, holy shit, they just killed
112 rank Sinatra. Today, there's no
way they would ever let that hap
pen. Which is too bad, because ac
tors love getting killed.
I: What about the middle class in
movies today?
BC: There's no middle class in
movies anymore. You're either
doing "Blaii Witch" 01 "Titanic."'
The middle ground is lost.
There are a few, like a lot of for
eign films, stuff that comes out
around now like "Billy Elliot.
I hey re certainly exceptions. and I
think this whole digital revolution
is going to help independents. Be
cause eventually they're going to
give up 011 the idea of film. And
they should.
You'll always hear those staunch
defenders go, "It'll never look as
good as film." You know what? Peo
ple aren't gonna even know.
I've got news for you, we're so
used to watching reality based TV
and the nightly news's on video,
and 50 percent of the footage we
see on TV is video. We're used to it.
We don't mind it.
Tell an engaging stor\ and peo
ple won't care il it's 70 mm or <S 111111
or video. It's all just technical inci
dental.
Anyone can go out and paint a
picture because it's so inexpensive.
But movies 101 the longest time
have been the sole propriety of
people with money, Fhey can con
trol it all — bankers and studios.
It's been an art form that is almost
strictly for the elite.
And I don't like that. Because
it's all very inbred. (Granted, there's
going to be a lot of shitty low-bud
get movies as a result, because the
one thing that studios have is expe
rience, and they hire experienced

people, generally speaking.
I: Can you tell us a little bit about
the video game "Evil Dead: I lail to
the King" that you made for
I'laystation and Dreamcast?
BC: 1 think it's pretty good. The
quality's good, and I think the guys
who are fans of the genre and fans
of the movies [will like it].
We've very lovingly recreated
certain atmospheres and really
kept it true to the series. It's a very
faithful rendition, and I think peo
ple who buy it will be very happy.
It's the next best thing to "Evil
Dead 4." I mainly did voice acting,
hut myself and Sam [Raimi]
weren't involved day-to-day. We
were just glad a company was in
terested enough to do it.
It was fun to play Ash without
having to be covered in blood and
go through .ill that nightmare. 1
could sit in a nice, clean, aii -condi
tioned booth and go "Ooh! Ah!
()w! Oh!" instead of actually hav
ing to be- there.
I: Are \ou also workingoll a book?
BC: Yeah, I'm fiddling around
with a title-. Right now, it's "M\
Chin Can Hurt IVople: Confes
sions of a B-Movie Actor." It's com
ing out in spring, and it sort of
chronic les from my point ol view
the independent world and the
forgotten middle class in Holly
wood.
The money for those films
aren't being funded by <1 Fortune
500 company, then c an't just write
a check and say "Here you go."
Thev have to raise money like the
Little Rascals raised monev, you
know, selling lemonade and stuff.
And I find that to be a more Amer
ican story.
I: Are you working on am other
projec is for the future?
BC'.: I here's a documentary called
"Fanalvsis" about fans that I just
finished up, and I mas package a
DVD ol it with mv book he-cause
there's a chapter in my book about
the film.
I finished a couple of episodes
Ibr a show called "Beggars and
Choosers' lor Showtime about the
TV business. I get to play <1 gav
ac tor, and that was fun.
And I just finished directing a
couple of "VIP" episodes with
Pamela Anderson.
I: Seriously? How was that?
BC: It was great because I don't
mind cutting my teeth on any
thing. As a director, I'll take any
thing right now. It's been a good
challenge.
I: What kind of films do you per
sonally enjoy when you go out to
the movies?
BC: I usually avoid summer
movies because they're so stupid.

It's because of (lie money thing.
The studios are so terrified that
they're going to lose money that
there won't be anything in the
script that will be a surprise.
I see movies during the fall and
then avoid them during Christmas
or any big holiday. 1 don't need to
see any of those movies.
Do you think I'm gonna see
"Charlie's Angels?" I got news for
you — it was a shitty TV show, and
it's gonna be a shitty movie too.
And any movie that's on a Taco
Bell cup I won't see. Because that
means .it some point in that stupid
movie, someone's gonna go, "I ley,
let's go to Taco Bell." Product
placement is out of hand. All of
these shitty movies, I'm telling you.
.. some people say that creative
people go to Hollywood. I don't
think so. Creative people are beat
en down l>\ Hollywood; the) re
beaten into submission. And
they're mollified with motiev —
the opiate. It's like "You can't make
your pet project this year, but is
$10 million oka\ ?" "Yeah, it's okay.
Oh, alright. ' It's a freak) industry.
I: Anv opinions on the 2000 elec
tion?
BC: Yeah. One man, one vote.
I hev should get rid of the ele( toral
college. Al (iore is running around
in Florida and Oeorge Bush is
hanging out Michigan and they re
both in Pennsylvania. I hey
shouldn't just worn about those
states; the\ should worn about
every state in the union if they
know that one shmuck pulling a
levet is going to mean something.
You can't ignore small states.
It's ridiculous. "()h, I ain't goin to
Alaska. I'hey ain't worth shit."
What kind of attitude is that?
Also, I'd like to see about a
do/en candidates that get mote
press. I mean, granted, then "s ,i lot
of candidates who don't get press
and 1 in glad thc\ don't. I think the
two-part \ system has wa\ outlived
its usefulness.
I think we gotta really stai i kick
ing some ass here. Ralph Nader
takes realh good potshots .it both
(.ore and Bush. sa\ ing that the) re
cut from the same doth, and the)
kind of are. The whole lesser of two
evils is really true. I his whole lob-
In ing slut just has to go away. Spe
cial interests, soft money, hard
money — what a bore.
I: Anv (losing comments?
BC: No. Oh wait, yeah. Don't go to
a movie because you're told that it's
a "must see" film. There's no such
thing as a "must see" film. Go be
cause you really think it 'll be a good
film. Don't go because of stupid
quotes on the movies from some
unknown news source. I love it, all
the dot-dot-dots. "Great film dot
dot-dot, Spectacular dot-dot-dot."
It could have said "Great film fora
piece of shit. Spectacular disaster."
You know what I mean? It's all a
bunch of crap.

Agents are involved in that sort
ol thing because they know they
can set it up. II you see something
come down the pipes and you go,
"Frank can nail that!" it's that sort
of inentalih where you might .is
well make the same movie.
Producers are gniliv because
they want a sure thing. They know
the studio will greenlight it it von
can get a I larrison Ford. So I lan i
son keeps saying no, so you keep
upping his price.
I've talked to some actors that
wind up in a project and you go.
"So how'd you end up on this
thing?" and tliev say, "Oh, I just
kept saying no and they just kept
raising the pi ice until I couldn't sav
no anymore."
An actor must take certain re
sponsibilities because if they say yes
to the same thing over and over
and over again, either they like it or
they're idiots In Hollywood, per
ception is nine-tenths the law.
Whatever you are perceived as is
who you are. Fhe trick is to keep
changing these perceptions.
I: Can you talk about this type of
stereoty ping within the industry ?
B( 1: Well, there's only about ten big
name actors out there now. And in
many cases, the agency that repre
sents them will represent the direc -
tors and the writers, and they'll
package it whether it's tight fin-
Brad Pitt or not.
It's this whole Hollywood ap
proach where you go, "Well I don't
give a shit, Michelle Pfeiffer is in
the same agency that's represent
ing the writer and the producer
and the director," so they say,
"Let's all keep it together!" and
then they approach the studio and
go, "Ah? Ah? Look .it that pack
age!" and the studio goes," I ley, we

don't have to do anything!" And
then it's sold. And that's kind of
liovv it works.
I: So is this the prototypical big stu
dio approach?
BC: In big studios, people get
weird because there's so much
money at stake, fake ;i movie like
"Die Hard." He's gonna get tin
had guy. You can't have those '70s
types of endings where the had guy
gets away, and the hero's lying
there bleeding in the gutter.
A friend of mine co-wrote the
movie " The Rookie" with Clint
Fastwooel. And in the original
draft, Clint gets killed at the end.
Fhe studio executives are going,
"Are you out of your fucking
mind? You (.111 wound him, you
can maim him, do whatever, but
you're not killing him. Don't even
show that to (Hint. (lause he'll like
it.' So they'll make decisions that
are based on inone\ because the)
want a possibility ola sequel. II In
dies, you can't have it.
hi "Von Ryan's Kxpress,"
Frank Sinatra is running lor the
train at the end and a plane just
comes and guns him down. And
it's like, holy shit, they just killed
112 rank Sinatra. Today, there's no
way they would ever let that hap
pen. Which is too bad, because ac
tors love getting killed.
I: What about the middle class in
movies today?
BC: There's no middle class in
movies anymore. You're either
doing "Blaii Witch" 01 "Titanic."'
The middle ground is lost.
There are a few, like a lot of for
eign films, stuff that comes out
around now like "Billy Elliot.
I hey re certainly exceptions. and I
think this whole digital revolution
is going to help independents. Be
cause eventually they're going to
give up 011 the idea of film. And
they should.
You'll always hear those staunch
defenders go, "It'll never look as
good as film." You know what? Peo
ple aren't gonna even know.
I've got news for you, we're so
used to watching reality based TV
and the nightly news's on video,
and 50 percent of the footage we
see on TV is video. We're used to it.
We don't mind it.
Tell an engaging stor\ and peo
ple won't care il it's 70 mm or <S 111111
or video. It's all just technical inci
dental.
Anyone can go out and paint a
picture because it's so inexpensive.
But movies 101 the longest time
have been the sole propriety of
people with money, Fhey can con
trol it all — bankers and studios.
It's been an art form that is almost
strictly for the elite.
And I don't like that. Because
it's all very inbred. (Granted, there's
going to be a lot of shitty low-bud
get movies as a result, because the
one thing that studios have is expe
rience, and they hire experienced

people, generally speaking.
I: Can you tell us a little bit about
the video game "Evil Dead: I lail to
the King" that you made for
I'laystation and Dreamcast?
BC: 1 think it's pretty good. The
quality's good, and I think the guys
who are fans of the genre and fans
of the movies [will like it].
We've very lovingly recreated
certain atmospheres and really
kept it true to the series. It's a very
faithful rendition, and I think peo
ple who buy it will be very happy.
It's the next best thing to "Evil
Dead 4." I mainly did voice acting,
hut myself and Sam [Raimi]
weren't involved day-to-day. We
were just glad a company was in
terested enough to do it.
It was fun to play Ash without
having to be covered in blood and
go through .ill that nightmare. 1
could sit in a nice, clean, aii -condi
tioned booth and go "Ooh! Ah!
()w! Oh!" instead of actually hav
ing to be- there.
I: Are \ou also workingoll a book?
BC: Yeah, I'm fiddling around
with a title-. Right now, it's "M\
Chin Can Hurt IVople: Confes
sions of a B-Movie Actor." It's com
ing out in spring, and it sort of
chronic les from my point ol view
the independent world and the
forgotten middle class in Holly
wood.
The money for those films
aren't being funded by <1 Fortune
500 company, then c an't just write
a check and say "Here you go."
Thev have to raise money like the
Little Rascals raised monev, you
know, selling lemonade and stuff.
And I find that to be a more Amer
ican story.
I: Are you working on am other
projec is for the future?
BC'.: I here's a documentary called
"Fanalvsis" about fans that I just
finished up, and I mas package a
DVD ol it with mv book he-cause
there's a chapter in my book about
the film.
I finished a couple of episodes
Ibr a show called "Beggars and
Choosers' lor Showtime about the
TV business. I get to play <1 gav
ac tor, and that was fun.
And I just finished directing a
couple of "VIP" episodes with
Pamela Anderson.
I: Seriously? How was that?
BC: It was great because I don't
mind cutting my teeth on any
thing. As a director, I'll take any
thing right now. It's been a good
challenge.
I: What kind of films do you per
sonally enjoy when you go out to
the movies?
BC: I usually avoid summer
movies because they're so stupid.

It's because of (lie money thing.
The studios are so terrified that
they're going to lose money that
there won't be anything in the
script that will be a surprise.
I see movies during the fall and
then avoid them during Christmas
or any big holiday. 1 don't need to
see any of those movies.
Do you think I'm gonna see
"Charlie's Angels?" I got news for
you — it was a shitty TV show, and
it's gonna be a shitty movie too.
And any movie that's on a Taco
Bell cup I won't see. Because that
means .it some point in that stupid
movie, someone's gonna go, "I ley,
let's go to Taco Bell." Product
placement is out of hand. All of
these shitty movies, I'm telling you.
.. some people say that creative
people go to Hollywood. I don't
think so. Creative people are beat
en down l>\ Hollywood; the) re
beaten into submission. And
they're mollified with motiev —
the opiate. It's like "You can't make
your pet project this year, but is
$10 million oka\ ?" "Yeah, it's okay.
Oh, alright. ' It's a freak) industry.
I: Anv opinions on the 2000 elec
tion?
BC: Yeah. One man, one vote.
I hev should get rid of the ele( toral
college. Al (iore is running around
in Florida and Oeorge Bush is
hanging out Michigan and they re
both in Pennsylvania. I hey
shouldn't just worn about those
states; the\ should worn about
every state in the union if they
know that one shmuck pulling a
levet is going to mean something.
You can't ignore small states.
It's ridiculous. "()h, I ain't goin to
Alaska. I'hey ain't worth shit."
What kind of attitude is that?
Also, I'd like to see about a
do/en candidates that get mote
press. I mean, granted, then "s ,i lot
of candidates who don't get press
and 1 in glad thc\ don't. I think the
two-part \ system has wa\ outlived
its usefulness.
I think we gotta really stai i kick
ing some ass here. Ralph Nader
takes realh good potshots .it both
(.ore and Bush. sa\ ing that the) re
cut from the same doth, and the)
kind of are. The whole lesser of two
evils is really true. I his whole lob-
In ing slut just has to go away. Spe
cial interests, soft money, hard
money — what a bore.
I: Anv (losing comments?
BC: No. Oh wait, yeah. Don't go to
a movie because you're told that it's
a "must see" film. There's no such
thing as a "must see" film. Go be
cause you really think it 'll be a good
film. Don't go because of stupid
quotes on the movies from some
unknown news source. I love it, all
the dot-dot-dots. "Great film dot
dot-dot, Spectacular dot-dot-dot."
It could have said "Great film fora
piece of shit. Spectacular disaster."
You know what I mean? It's all a
bunch of crap.
"I'm a character actor trapped
in a leading-man's body," declared
Bruce Campbell, self-proclaimed
B-movie actor and star of the ( las
sie ( iilt horror films that make up
the "Evil Dead" trilogy. Campbell,
who went on to star in the short
lived television Western "1 he .Ad
ventures of Brisco County Jr." as
well the ollbeat period show " Jack
ol All Trades." admits to having
been typecast as a horror / sci-fi
character actor, and his roles in
low-budget films and short stints
on FV shows like "I'he X-Files"
,ind "Xena: Warrior Princess" only
continue to establish this label. I lis
tongue-in-cheek humor and sell
knowing sarcasm are fiercely
adored by his small but loyal fan
base, and mam Stanford admirers
of Bruce Campbell came out to
show their support for his on-cam
piis appearance last week.
On Halloween night, the Stan
lord Film Society held a screening
of "Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn" in
( aibberley Auditorium. I lie event
was co-sponsored by the ASS I.'
Speakers Bureau and the C.radu
ate Student ('.ouniil.
There was no denying the ex
citement of the crowd as ('.amphcll
walked out on state to introduce
the movie. He was greeted by a
standing ovation, and he proceed
ed to raffle off signed VI IS and
DVD copies of the "Evil Dead"
films before settling into the- audi
ence himself to watch the movie.
Making an occasional wisecrack or
two during the screening, he then

spent a good hour answering ques
tions from the crowd iu addition to
signing autographs for anyone
willing to wait in line. There is no
denying Campbell's appeal — he
is a genuinely nice guy who truly
appreciates his fans, and that's why
they love him like the one-handed,
chainsaw-wielding destroyer of
Deadites that he really is. Intermis
sion got the opportunity to sit
down with Bruce "Ash" Campbell
and ask him about bis work, the in
dustry and politics. I lere's what he
had to say.
Intermission: What's your opinion
about the < iill following that has
sprung up around the "Evil 1 )ead"
movies?
Bruce Campbell: I think it's great
that someone likes something
enough that they're going to watch
it over and over and over and
never get tired of it. That 's a good
sign. I have a theory that movies
that are hard to make are easy to
watch, and movies that are easv to
make are hard to watch, because
vou're not really putting enough
effort into it. We busted our ass on
all three of the "Evil Dead films,
and I think it shows.
Wlietliet you like the movies or
not. at least we worked hard.
There are plenty of people who do
not like those movies, and there are
plenty of people who should not
see those movies. You know, like all
the Scandinavians.
Kut really, I'm pleased that peo
ple like them. And I can trace my
every advance as an actor based on
what those movies provided foi me
as far as opportunities.

I: Which of the "Evil Dead" films
did you most enjoy working on?
BC: Probably part two because we
had enough mone\ to do it right,
we had enough experience to be
able to be better filmmakers, and
not enough studio intervention to
make it a nightmare.
I: So "Army of Darkness" had a lot
of studio intervention?
BC: It had a lot, yeah. We had to
reshoot the ending and we had to
recut the film. The original version
was 9(> minutes and what came out
was 81 minutes.
It wasn't playing that well to test
audiences, and they base every
thing on those stores. Hie shorter
they made [the movie], the

higher the stores were, so
the) just kept shortening it.
There's an element of truth
in that. In what I tall a dum
dum movie, which is "Army
of Darkness,'' we tut out
mostly the battle footage at
the end.
They would ask, "But it
you have six skeletons blow
ing up, why not just have
three? YVhv do you have to
have six?" So it was imnossi-

ble for us to defend the movie
when it i ante time to edit, flic stu
dios would say,"(ait that out," and
we could nevei argue, "hut that's
integral to the plot." And that was
our own shortcoming.
I: So they'd cut it even if you spent
mone\ 011 making the scenes?
BC: They don't give a shit. V'ou
know, whatever the comment
cards said, tested audiences scored
it low. fhat's what matters in the
end.
I: Do you think you'll ever have the
kind ol freedom that you had with
"Evil Dead 2" again?

liC: Yeah — "Jack of All Trades." 1
was one of the exec producers so
they sort of tailored it for me. My
main goal was to get these two writ
ers I'd worked with on "Hercules"
and "Xena" that I thought
matched m\ sensibilities for that
genre. So we brought them on
board. We'd shot a bunch of stuff in
New Zealand and 1 was very famil
iar with New Zealand, so we decid
ed to do it there. After you've been
in television long enough, you
don't have to audition. At that
point, I'd ah ead) done "Hercules'"
and "Xena" for live years so I
didn't have to prove anything to
anybody. It was totally hands-olf,
and we had total creative control.
Good or bad, success or failure,
that's why I was happy to do that
show, because we could do am
thing we wanted. It was the perfe< t
creative situation, which was whv I
was willing to go to the frickin'
Southern Hemisphere to do it. lie
cause after a while, you've got to go
where you can do your work. As lai
as that show's concerned, though. I
just finished m\ first season and m\
last season. September 23rd, it just

got cancelled. Which is line. Rat
ings determine everything. Every
single show gets cancelled because
of low ratings — there's almost no
other reason.
I: Any chance it'll be picked up
again?
BC: No, because old TV shows
age like fish. No one wants to be
associated with television that's
been canceled.
I: Can you talk a little about being
t\ pet <ist as .in actor?
BC: An actor just wants to be an
actor. I've done a bunch of genre
stuff that's directly related to the
first "Kvil Dead" movie. You've
been in ,t couple of horror films so
it's like, "Let's get that gin who
does horror films." It's exciting at
first — I did some genre movies,
inosth science fiction, mostly hor
ror, and you fall into that trap. You
can either embrace it 01 fight
against it or do a little of both. It
helps you in that it you get in some
thing successful, you'll be known
lor something.
lint you also run the risk of
being stuck there. I have a lot of re
spect lor people like Sean (lonnery
a whole young generation
doesn't even know he was in the
bond films. It's an ama/ing thing
to overcome. Harrison Ford got
over the Indiana Jones thing and
the Stat Wars thing. But that's
pretty rare.
Reporters and news organiza
tions love to write "best known
loi." Everyone tries to get a handle
on "what is that person best known
loir" I hope I'm never best known
lot anything.
I: But do you think that you're best
known foi something?
BC.: Oil sure, the "Kvil Dead"
movies. And 1 have no problem
with that.
I: How did working on television
change your perception as a movie
actor?
BC: More people will see a low
rated television show in one night
than a whole run of a successful
movie. Even "Brisco County." I
found tli,it when I started to go to
conventions after that, a whole new
batch of people showed up. Not
the tattooed, spiked-haired, "Evil
Dead" goth crowd. It was little Billy
dressed as.»cowboy and a little girl
who owned a horse and wanted to
talk about horses. It was all a fami
ly thing. You're coming into their
homes lot free, and it allows you to
reach a whole new fan base.
1: So do you think you'd want more
of that type of greater recognition?

BC: Well, I'd hate to be a Tom
Cruise type where you have to
wear a disguise just to go to a
movie. They steal your kids. Weird
shit can happen.
I: So you'tl rather work in smaller
pictures?
BC.: I think it depends on tin- oi
lers. Some actors never want to
turn down work. But you have to
assert yourselfat some point. If you
don't say no, you lose all respect.
Fear drives you not to say it earlier
in your career. It's a big fear.
I: How does a career-minded ap
proach ailed the making of a pic -
ture?
BC: Producers put the project to
gether; they want it to be successful.
I'll give you a c lassic example. I have
a lot of respect for Frank Darabont
who did the movie "The Shaw
shank Redemption," a period
prison movie based on a Stephen
King novel. His lilm after that was
" I he (ireen Mile." A period prison
movie based on a Stephen King
novel. And you go, "Wow!' I mean,
that was a no-brainer.
Agents are involved in that sort
ol thing because they know they
can set it up. II you see something
come down the pipes and you go,
"Frank can nail that!" it's that sort
of inentalih where you might .is
well make the same movie.
Producers are gniliv because
they want a sure thing. They know
the studio will greenlight it it von
can get a I larrison Ford. So I lan i
son keeps saying no, so you keep
upping his price.
I've talked to some actors that
wind up in a project and you go.
"So how'd you end up on this
thing?" and tliev say, "Oh, I just
kept saying no and they just kept
raising the pi ice until I couldn't sav

I: Anv (losing comments?
BC: No. Oh wait, yeah. Don't go to
a movie because you're told that it's
a "must see" film. There's no such
thing as a "must see" film. Go be
cause you really think it 'll be a good
film. Don't go because of stupid
quotes on the movies from some
unknown news source. I love it, all

"I'm a character actor trapped
in a leading-man's body," declared
Bruce Campbell, self-proclaimed
B-movie actor and star of the ( las
sie ( iilt horror films that make up
the "Evil Dead" trilogy. Campbell,
who went on to star in the short
lived television Western "1 he .Ad
ventures of Brisco County Jr." as
well the ollbeat period show " Jack
ol All Trades." admits to having
been typecast as a horror / sci-fi
character actor, and his roles in
low-budget films and short stints
on FV shows like "I'he X-Files"
,ind "Xena: Warrior Princess" only
continue to establish this label. I lis
tongue-in-cheek humor and sell
knowing sarcasm are fiercely
adored by his small but loyal fan
base, and mam Stanford admirers
of Bruce Campbell came out to
show their support for his on-cam
piis appearance last week.
On Halloween night, the Stan
lord Film Society held a screening
of "Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn" in
( aibberley Auditorium. I lie event
was co-sponsored by the ASS I.'
Speakers Bureau and the C.radu
ate Student ('.ouniil.
There was no denying the ex
citement of the crowd as ('.amphcll
walked out on state to introduce
the movie. He was greeted by a
standing ovation, and he proceed
ed to raffle off signed VI IS and
DVD copies of the "Evil Dead"
films before settling into the- audi
ence himself to watch the movie.
Making an occasional wisecrack or
two during the screening, he then

spent a good hour answering ques
tions from the crowd iu addition to
signing autographs for anyone
willing to wait in line. There is no
denying Campbell's appeal — he
is a genuinely nice guy who truly
appreciates his fans, and that's why
they love him like the one-handed,
chainsaw-wielding destroyer of
Deadites that he really is. Intermis
sion got the opportunity to sit
down with Bruce "Ash" Campbell
and ask him about bis work, the in
dustry and politics. I lere's what he
had to say.
Intermission: What's your opinion
about the < iill following that has
sprung up around the "Evil 1 )ead"
movies?
Bruce Campbell: I think it's great
that someone likes something
enough that they're going to watch
it over and over and over and
never get tired of it. That 's a good
sign. I have a theory that movies
that are hard to make are easy to
watch, and movies that are easv to
make are hard to watch, because
vou're not really putting enough
effort into it. We busted our ass on
all three of the "Evil Dead films,
and I think it shows.
Wlietliet you like the movies or
not. at least we worked hard.
There are plenty of people who do
not like those movies, and there are
plenty of people who should not
see those movies. You know, like all
the Scandinavians.
Kut really, I'm pleased that peo
ple like them. And I can trace my
every advance as an actor based on
what those movies provided foi me
as far as opportunities.

I: Which of the "Evil Dead" films
did you most enjoy working on?
BC: Probably part two because we
had enough mone\ to do it right,
we had enough experience to be
able to be better filmmakers, and
not enough studio intervention to
make it a nightmare.
I: So "Army of Darkness" had a lot
of studio intervention?
BC: It had a lot, yeah. We had to
reshoot the ending and we had to
recut the film. The original version
was 9(> minutes and what came out
was 81 minutes.
It wasn't playing that well to test
audiences, and they base every
thing on those stores. Hie shorter
they made [the movie], the

higher the stores were, so
the) just kept shortening it.
There's an element of truth
in that. In what I tall a dum
dum movie, which is "Army
of Darkness,'' we tut out
mostly the battle footage at
the end.
They would ask, "But it
you have six skeletons blow
ing up, why not just have
three? YVhv do you have to
have six?" So it was imnossi-

ble for us to defend the movie
when it i ante time to edit, flic stu
dios would say,"(ait that out," and
we could nevei argue, "hut that's
integral to the plot." And that was
our own shortcoming.
I: So they'd cut it even if you spent
mone\ 011 making the scenes?
BC: They don't give a shit. V'ou
know, whatever the comment
cards said, tested audiences scored
it low. fhat's what matters in the
end.
I: Do you think you'll ever have the
kind ol freedom that you had with
"Evil Dead 2" again?

liC: Yeah — "Jack of All Trades." 1
was one of the exec producers so
they sort of tailored it for me. My
main goal was to get these two writ
ers I'd worked with on "Hercules"
and "Xena" that I thought
matched m\ sensibilities for that
genre. So we brought them on
board. We'd shot a bunch of stuff in
New Zealand and 1 was very famil
iar with New Zealand, so we decid
ed to do it there. After you've been
in television long enough, you
don't have to audition. At that
point, I'd ah ead) done "Hercules'"
and "Xena" for live years so I
didn't have to prove anything to
anybody. It was totally hands-olf,
and we had total creative control.
Good or bad, success or failure,
that's why I was happy to do that
show, because we could do am
thing we wanted. It was the perfe< t
creative situation, which was whv I
was willing to go to the frickin'
Southern Hemisphere to do it. lie
cause after a while, you've got to go
where you can do your work. As lai
as that show's concerned, though. I

got cancelled. Which is line. Rat
ings determine everything. Every
single show gets cancelled because
of low ratings — there's almost no
other reason.
I: Any chance it'll be picked up
again?
BC: No, because old TV shows
age like fish. No one wants to be
associated with television that's
been canceled.
I: Can you talk a little about being
t\ pet <ist as .in actor?
BC: An actor just wants to be an
actor. I've done a bunch of genre
stuff that's directly related to the
first "Kvil Dead" movie. You've
been in ,t couple of horror films so
it's like, "Let's get that gin who
does horror films." It's exciting at
first — I did some genre movies,
inosth science fiction, mostly hor
ror, and you fall into that trap. You
can either embrace it 01 fight
against it or do a little of both. It
helps you in that it you get in some
thing successful, you'll be known
lor something.
lint you also run the risk of
being stuck there. I have a lot of re
spect lor people like Sean (lonnery
a whole young generation
doesn't even know he was in the
bond films. It's an ama/ing thing
to overcome. Harrison Ford got
over the Indiana Jones thing and
the Stat Wars thing. But that's
pretty rare.
Reporters and news organiza
tions love to write "best known
loi." Everyone tries to get a handle
on "what is that person best known
loir" I hope I'm never best known
lot anything.
I: But do you think that you're best
known foi something?
BC.: Oil sure, the "Kvil Dead"
movies. And 1 have no problem
with that.
I: How did working on television
change your perception as a movie
actor?
BC: More people will see a low
rated television show in one night
than a whole run of a successful
movie. Even "Brisco County." I
found tli,it when I started to go to
conventions after that, a whole new
batch of people showed up. Not
the tattooed, spiked-haired, "Evil
Dead" goth crowd. It was little Billy
dressed as.»cowboy and a little girl
who owned a horse and wanted to
talk about horses. It was all a fami
ly thing. You're coming into their
homes lot free, and it allows you to
reach a whole new fan base.
1: So do you think you'd want more
of that type of greater recognition?

BC: Well, I'd hate to be a Tom
Cruise type where you have to
wear a disguise just to go to a
movie. They steal your kids. Weird
shit can happen.
I: So you'tl rather work in smaller
pictures?
BC.: I think it depends on tin- oi
lers. Some actors never want to
turn down work. But you have to
assert yourselfat some point. If you
don't say no, you lose all respect.
Fear drives you not to say it earlier
in your career. It's a big fear.
I: How does a career-minded ap
proach ailed the making of a pic -
ture?
BC: Producers put the project to
gether; they want it to be successful.
I'll give you a c lassic example. I have
a lot of respect for Frank Darabont
who did the movie "The Shaw
shank Redemption," a period
prison movie based on a Stephen
King novel. His lilm after that was
" I he (ireen Mile." A period prison
movie based on a Stephen King
novel. And you go, "Wow!' I mean,
that was a no-brainer.
Agents are involved in that sort
ol thing because they know they
can set it up. II you see something
come down the pipes and you go,
"Frank can nail that!" it's that sort
of inentalih where you might .is
well make the same movie.
Producers are gniliv because
they want a sure thing. They know
the studio will greenlight it it von
can get a I larrison Ford. So I lan i
son keeps saying no, so you keep
upping his price.
I've talked to some actors that
wind up in a project and you go.
"So how'd you end up on this
thing?" and tliev say, "Oh, I just
kept saying no and they just kept
raising the pi ice until I couldn't sav
no anymore."
An actor must take certain re
sponsibilities because if they say yes
to the same thing over and over
and over again, either they like it or
they're idiots In Hollywood, per
ception is nine-tenths the law.
Whatever you are perceived as is
who you are. Fhe trick is to keep
changing these perceptions.
I: Can you talk about this type of
stereoty ping within the industry ?
B( 1: Well, there's only about ten big
name actors out there now. And in
many cases, the agency that repre
sents them will represent the direc -
tors and the writers, and they'll
package it whether it's tight fin-
Brad Pitt or not.
It's this whole Hollywood ap
proach where you go, "Well I don't
give a shit, Michelle Pfeiffer is in
the same agency that's represent
ing the writer and the producer
and the director," so they say,
"Let's all keep it together!" and
then they approach the studio and
go, "Ah? Ah? Look .it that pack
age!" and the studio goes," I ley, we

don't have to do anything!" And
then it's sold. And that's kind of
liovv it works.
I: So is this the prototypical big stu
dio approach?
BC: In big studios, people get
weird because there's so much
money at stake, fake ;i movie like
"Die Hard." He's gonna get tin
had guy. You can't have those '70s
types of endings where the had guy
gets away, and the hero's lying
there bleeding in the gutter.
A friend of mine co-wrote the
movie " The Rookie" with Clint
Fastwooel. And in the original
draft, Clint gets killed at the end.
Fhe studio executives are going,
"Are you out of your fucking
mind? You (.111 wound him, you
can maim him, do whatever, but
you're not killing him. Don't even
show that to (Hint. (lause he'll like
it.' So they'll make decisions that
are based on inone\ because the)
want a possibility ola sequel. II In
dies, you can't have it.
hi "Von Ryan's Kxpress,"
Frank Sinatra is running lor the
train at the end and a plane just
comes and guns him down. And
it's like, holy shit, they just killed
112 rank Sinatra. Today, there's no
way they would ever let that hap
pen. Which is too bad, because ac
tors love getting killed.
I: What about the middle class in
movies today?
BC: There's no middle class in
movies anymore. You're either
doing "Blaii Witch" 01 "Titanic."'
The middle ground is lost.
There are a few, like a lot of for
eign films, stuff that comes out
around now like "Billy Elliot.
I hey re certainly exceptions. and I
think this whole digital revolution
is going to help independents. Be
cause eventually they're going to
give up 011 the idea of film. And
they should.
You'll always hear those staunch
defenders go, "It'll never look as
good as film." You know what? Peo
ple aren't gonna even know.
I've got news for you, we're so
used to watching reality based TV
and the nightly news's on video,
and 50 percent of the footage we
see on TV is video. We're used to it.
We don't mind it.
Tell an engaging stor\ and peo
ple won't care il it's 70 mm or <S 111111
or video. It's all just technical inci
dental.
Anyone can go out and paint a
picture because it's so inexpensive.
But movies 101 the longest time
have been the sole propriety of
people with money, Fhey can con
trol it all — bankers and studios.
It's been an art form that is almost
strictly for the elite.
And I don't like that. Because
it's all very inbred. (Granted, there's
going to be a lot of shitty low-bud
get movies as a result, because the
one thing that studios have is expe
rience, and they hire experienced

people, generally speaking.
I: Can you tell us a little bit about
the video game "Evil Dead: I lail to
the King" that you made for
I'laystation and Dreamcast?
BC: 1 think it's pretty good. The
quality's good, and I think the guys
who are fans of the genre and fans
of the movies [will like it].
We've very lovingly recreated
certain atmospheres and really
kept it true to the series. It's a very
faithful rendition, and I think peo
ple who buy it will be very happy.
It's the next best thing to "Evil
Dead 4." I mainly did voice acting,
hut myself and Sam [Raimi]
weren't involved day-to-day. We
were just glad a company was in
terested enough to do it.
It was fun to play Ash without
having to be covered in blood and
go through .ill that nightmare. 1
could sit in a nice, clean, aii -condi
tioned booth and go "Ooh! Ah!
()w! Oh!" instead of actually hav
ing to be- there.
I: Are \ou also workingoll a book?
BC: Yeah, I'm fiddling around
with a title-. Right now, it's "M\
Chin Can Hurt IVople: Confes
sions of a B-Movie Actor." It's com
ing out in spring, and it sort of
chronic les from my point ol view
the independent world and the
forgotten middle class in Holly
wood.
The money for those films
aren't being funded by <1 Fortune
500 company, then c an't just write
a check and say "Here you go."
Thev have to raise money like the
Little Rascals raised monev, you
know, selling lemonade and stuff.
And I find that to be a more Amer
ican story.
I: Are you working on am other
projec is for the future?
BC'.: I here's a documentary called
"Fanalvsis" about fans that I just
finished up, and I mas package a
DVD ol it with mv book he-cause
there's a chapter in my book about
the film.
I finished a couple of episodes
Ibr a show called "Beggars and
Choosers' lor Showtime about the
TV business. I get to play <1 gav
ac tor, and that was fun.
And I just finished directing a
couple of "VIP" episodes with
Pamela Anderson.
I: Seriously? How was that?
BC: It was great because I don't
mind cutting my teeth on any
thing. As a director, I'll take any
thing right now. It's been a good
challenge.
I: What kind of films do you per
sonally enjoy when you go out to
the movies?
BC: I usually avoid summer
movies because they're so stupid.

It's because of (lie money thing.
The studios are so terrified that
they're going to lose money that
there won't be anything in the
script that will be a surprise.
I see movies during the fall and
then avoid them during Christmas
or any big holiday. 1 don't need to
see any of those movies.
Do you think I'm gonna see
"Charlie's Angels?" I got news for
you — it was a shitty TV show, and
it's gonna be a shitty movie too.
And any movie that's on a Taco
Bell cup I won't see. Because that
means .it some point in that stupid
movie, someone's gonna go, "I ley,
let's go to Taco Bell." Product
placement is out of hand. All of
these shitty movies, I'm telling you.
.. some people say that creative
people go to Hollywood. I don't
think so. Creative people are beat
en down l>\ Hollywood; the) re
beaten into submission. And
they're mollified with motiev —
the opiate. It's like "You can't make
your pet project this year, but is
$10 million oka\ ?" "Yeah, it's okay.
Oh, alright. ' It's a freak) industry.
I: Anv opinions on the 2000 elec
tion?
BC: Yeah. One man, one vote.
I hev should get rid of the ele( toral
college. Al (iore is running around
in Florida and Oeorge Bush is
hanging out Michigan and they re
both in Pennsylvania. I hey
shouldn't just worn about those
states; the\ should worn about
every state in the union if they
know that one shmuck pulling a
levet is going to mean something.
You can't ignore small states.
It's ridiculous. "()h, I ain't goin to
Alaska. I'hey ain't worth shit."
What kind of attitude is that?
Also, I'd like to see about a
do/en candidates that get mote
press. I mean, granted, then "s ,i lot
of candidates who don't get press
and 1 in glad thc\ don't. I think the
two-part \ system has wa\ outlived
its usefulness.
I think we gotta really stai i kick

cut from the same doth, and the)
kind of are. The whole lesser of two
evils is really true. I his whole lob-
In ing slut just has to go away. Spe

I: Anv (losing comments?
BC: No. Oh wait, yeah. Don't go to
a movie because you're told that it's
a "must see" film. There's no such

pictures?
BC.: I think it depends on tin- oi
lers. Some actors never want to
turn down work. But you have to
assert yourselfat some point. If you
don't say no, you lose all respect.
Fear drives you not to say it earlier
in your career. It's a big fear.
I: How does a career-minded ap
proach ailed the making of a pic -
ture?
BC: Producers put the project to
gether; they want it to be successful.
I'll give you a c lassic example. I have
a lot of respect for Frank Darabont
who did the movie "The Shaw
shank Redemption," a period
prison movie based on a Stephen
King novel. His lilm after that was
" I he (ireen Mile." A period prison
movie based on a Stephen King
novel. And you go, "Wow!' I mean,
that was a no-brainer.
Agents are involved in that sort
ol thing because they know they
can set it up. II you see something
come down the pipes and you go,
"Frank can nail that!" it's that sort
of inentalih where you might .is
well make the same movie.
Producers are gniliv because
they want a sure thing. They know
the studio will greenlight it it von
can get a I larrison Ford. So I lan i
son keeps saying no, so you keep
upping his price.
I've talked to some actors that
wind up in a project and you go.
"So how'd you end up on this
thing?" and tliev say, "Oh, I just
kept saying no and they just kept
raising the pi ice until I couldn't sav
no anymore."
An actor must take certain re
sponsibilities because if they say yes
to the same thing over and over
and over again, either they like it or
they're idiots In Hollywood, per
ception is nine-tenths the law.
Whatever you are perceived as is
who you are. Fhe trick is to keep
changing these perceptions.
I: Can you talk about this type of
stereoty ping within the industry ?
B( 1: Well, there's only about ten big
name actors out there now. And in
many cases, the agency that repre
sents them will represent the direc -
tors and the writers, and they'll
package it whether it's tight fin-
Brad Pitt or not.
It's this whole Hollywood ap
proach where you go, "Well I don't
give a shit, Michelle Pfeiffer is in
the same agency that's represent
ing the writer and the producer
and the director," so they say,
"Let's all keep it together!" and
then they approach the studio and
go, "Ah? Ah? Look .it that pack
age!" and the studio goes," I ley, we

don't have to do anything!" And
then it's sold. And that's kind of
liovv it works.
I: So is this the prototypical big stu
dio approach?
BC: In big studios, people get
weird because there's so much
money at stake, fake ;i movie like
"Die Hard." He's gonna get tin
had guy. You can't have those '70s
types of endings where the had guy
gets away, and the hero's lying
there bleeding in the gutter.
A friend of mine co-wrote the
movie " The Rookie" with Clint
Fastwooel. And in the original
draft, Clint gets killed at the end.
Fhe studio executives are going,
"Are you out of your fucking
mind? You (.111 wound him, you
can maim him, do whatever, but
you're not killing him. Don't even
show that to (Hint. (lause he'll like
it.' So they'll make decisions that
are based on inone\ because the)
want a possibility ola sequel. II In
dies, you can't have it.
hi "Von Ryan's Kxpress,"
Frank Sinatra is running lor the
train at the end and a plane just
comes and guns him down. And
it's like, holy shit, they just killed
112 rank Sinatra. Today, there's no
way they would ever let that hap
pen. Which is too bad, because ac
tors love getting killed.
I: What about the middle class in
movies today?
BC: There's no middle class in
movies anymore. You're either
doing "Blaii Witch" 01 "Titanic."'
The middle ground is lost.
There are a few, like a lot of for
eign films, stuff that comes out
around now like "Billy Elliot.
I hey re certainly exceptions. and I
think this whole digital revolution
is going to help independents. Be
cause eventually they're going to
give up 011 the idea of film. And
they should.
You'll always hear those staunch
defenders go, "It'll never look as
good as film." You know what? Peo
ple aren't gonna even know.
I've got news for you, we're so
used to watching reality based TV
and the nightly news's on video,
and 50 percent of the footage we
see on TV is video. We're used to it.
We don't mind it.
Tell an engaging stor\ and peo
ple won't care il it's 70 mm or <S 111111
or video. It's all just technical inci
dental.
Anyone can go out and paint a
picture because it's so inexpensive.
But movies 101 the longest time
have been the sole propriety of
people with money, Fhey can con
trol it all — bankers and studios.
It's been an art form that is almost
strictly for the elite.
And I don't like that. Because
it's all very inbred. (Granted, there's
going to be a lot of shitty low-bud
get movies as a result, because the
one thing that studios have is expe
rience, and they hire experienced

people, generally speaking.
I: Can you tell us a little bit about
the video game "Evil Dead: I lail to
the King" that you made for
I'laystation and Dreamcast?
BC: 1 think it's pretty good. The
quality's good, and I think the guys
who are fans of the genre and fans
of the movies [will like it].
We've very lovingly recreated
certain atmospheres and really
kept it true to the series. It's a very
faithful rendition, and I think peo
ple who buy it will be very happy.
It's the next best thing to "Evil
Dead 4." I mainly did voice acting,
hut myself and Sam [Raimi]
weren't involved day-to-day. We
were just glad a company was in
terested enough to do it.
It was fun to play Ash without
having to be covered in blood and
go through .ill that nightmare. 1
could sit in a nice, clean, aii -condi
tioned booth and go "Ooh! Ah!
()w! Oh!" instead of actually hav
ing to be- there.
I: Are \ou also workingoll a book?
BC: Yeah, I'm fiddling around
with a title-. Right now, it's "M\
Chin Can Hurt IVople: Confes
sions of a B-Movie Actor." It's com
ing out in spring, and it sort of
chronic les from my point ol view
the independent world and the
forgotten middle class in Holly
wood.
The money for those films
aren't being funded by <1 Fortune
500 company, then c an't just write
a check and say "Here you go."
Thev have to raise money like the
Little Rascals raised monev, you
know, selling lemonade and stuff.
And I find that to be a more Amer
ican story.
I: Are you working on am other
projec is for the future?
BC'.: I here's a documentary called
"Fanalvsis" about fans that I just
finished up, and I mas package a
DVD ol it with mv book he-cause
there's a chapter in my book about
the film.
I finished a couple of episodes
Ibr a show called "Beggars and
Choosers' lor Showtime about the
TV business. I get to play <1 gav
ac tor, and that was fun.
And I just finished directing a
couple of "VIP" episodes with
Pamela Anderson.
I: Seriously? How was that?
BC: It was great because I don't
mind cutting my teeth on any
thing. As a director, I'll take any
thing right now. It's been a good
challenge.
I: What kind of films do you per
sonally enjoy when you go out to
the movies?
BC: I usually avoid summer
movies because they're so stupid.

It's because of (lie money thing.
The studios are so terrified that
they're going to lose money that
there won't be anything in the
script that will be a surprise.
I see movies during the fall and
then avoid them during Christmas
or any big holiday. 1 don't need to
see any of those movies.
Do you think I'm gonna see
"Charlie's Angels?" I got news for
you — it was a shitty TV show, and
it's gonna be a shitty movie too.
And any movie that's on a Taco
Bell cup I won't see. Because that
means .it some point in that stupid
movie, someone's gonna go, "I ley,
let's go to Taco Bell." Product
placement is out of hand. All of
these shitty movies, I'm telling you.
.. some people say that creative
people go to Hollywood. I don't
think so. Creative people are beat
en down l>\ Hollywood; the) re
beaten into submission. And
they're mollified with motiev —
the opiate. It's like "You can't make
your pet project this year, but is
$10 million oka\ ?" "Yeah, it's okay.
Oh, alright. ' It's a freak) industry.
I: Anv opinions on the 2000 elec
tion?
BC: Yeah. One man, one vote.
I hev should get rid of the ele( toral
college. Al (iore is running around
in Florida and Oeorge Bush is
hanging out Michigan and they re
both in Pennsylvania. I hey
shouldn't just worn about those
states; the\ should worn about
every state in the union if they
know that one shmuck pulling a
levet is going to mean something.
You can't ignore small states.
It's ridiculous. "()h, I ain't goin to
Alaska. I'hey ain't worth shit."
What kind of attitude is that?
Also, I'd like to see about a
do/en candidates that get mote
press. I mean, granted, then "s ,i lot
of candidates who don't get press
and 1 in glad thc\ don't. I think the
two-part \ system has wa\ outlived
its usefulness.
I think we gotta really stai i kick
ing some ass here. Ralph Nader
takes realh good potshots .it both
(.ore and Bush. sa\ ing that the) re
cut from the same doth, and the)
kind of are. The whole lesser of two
evils is really true. I his whole lob-
In ing slut just has to go away. Spe
cial interests, soft money, hard
money — what a bore.
I: Anv (losing comments?
BC: No. Oh wait, yeah. Don't go to
a movie because you're told that it's
a "must see" film. There's no such
thing as a "must see" film. Go be
cause you really think it 'll be a good
film. Don't go because of stupid
quotes on the movies from some
unknown news source. I love it, all
the dot-dot-dots. "Great film dot
dot-dot, Spectacular dot-dot-dot."
It could have said "Great film fora
piece of shit. Spectacular disaster."
You know what I mean? It's all a
bunch of crap.
"I'm a character actor trapped
in a leading-man's body," declared
Bruce Campbell, self-proclaimed
B-movie actor and star of the ( las
sie ( iilt horror films that make up
the "Evil Dead" trilogy. Campbell,
who went on to star in the short
lived television Western "1 he .Ad
ventures of Brisco County Jr." as
well the ollbeat period show " Jack
ol All Trades." admits to having
been typecast as a horror / sci-fi
character actor, and his roles in
low-budget films and short stints
on FV shows like "I'he X-Files"
,ind "Xena: Warrior Princess" only
continue to establish this label. I lis
tongue-in-cheek humor and sell
knowing sarcasm are fiercely
adored by his small but loyal fan
base, and mam Stanford admirers
of Bruce Campbell came out to
show their support for his on-cam
piis appearance last week.
On Halloween night, the Stan
lord Film Society held a screening
of "Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn" in
( aibberley Auditorium. I lie event
was co-sponsored by the ASS I.'
Speakers Bureau and the C.radu
ate Student ('.ouniil.
There was no denying the ex
citement of the crowd as ('.amphcll
walked out on state to introduce
the movie. He was greeted by a
standing ovation, and he proceed
ed to raffle off signed VI IS and
DVD copies of the "Evil Dead"
films before settling into the- audi
ence himself to watch the movie.
Making an occasional wisecrack or
two during the screening, he then

spent a good hour answering ques
tions from the crowd iu addition to
signing autographs for anyone
willing to wait in line. There is no
denying Campbell's appeal — he
is a genuinely nice guy who truly
appreciates his fans, and that's why
they love him like the one-handed,
chainsaw-wielding destroyer of
Deadites that he really is. Intermis
sion got the opportunity to sit
down with Bruce "Ash" Campbell
and ask him about bis work, the in
dustry and politics. I lere's what he
had to say.
Intermission: What's your opinion
about the < iill following that has
sprung up around the "Evil 1 )ead"
movies?
Bruce Campbell: I think it's great
that someone likes something
enough that they're going to watch
it over and over and over and
never get tired of it. That 's a good
sign. I have a theory that movies
that are hard to make are easy to
watch, and movies that are easv to
make are hard to watch, because
vou're not really putting enough
effort into it. We busted our ass on
all three of the "Evil Dead films,
and I think it shows.
Wlietliet you like the movies or
not. at least we worked hard.
There are plenty of people who do
not like those movies, and there are
plenty of people who should not
see those movies. You know, like all
the Scandinavians.
Kut really, I'm pleased that peo
ple like them. And I can trace my
every advance as an actor based on
what those movies provided foi me
as far as opportunities.

I: Which of the "Evil Dead" films
did you most enjoy working on?
BC: Probably part two because we
had enough mone\ to do it right,
we had enough experience to be
able to be better filmmakers, and
not enough studio intervention to
make it a nightmare.
I: So "Army of Darkness" had a lot
of studio intervention?
BC: It had a lot, yeah. We had to
reshoot the ending and we had to
recut the film. The original version
was 9(> minutes and what came out
was 81 minutes.
It wasn't playing that well to test
audiences, and they base every
thing on those stores. Hie shorter
they made [the movie], the

higher the stores were, so
the) just kept shortening it.
There's an element of truth
in that. In what I tall a dum
dum movie, which is "Army
of Darkness,'' we tut out
mostly the battle footage at
the end.
They would ask, "But it
you have six skeletons blow
ing up, why not just have
three? YVhv do you have to
have six?" So it was imnossi-

ble for us to defend the movie
when it i ante time to edit, flic stu
dios would say,"(ait that out," and
we could nevei argue, "hut that's
integral to the plot." And that was
our own shortcoming.
I: So they'd cut it even if you spent
mone\ 011 making the scenes?
BC: They don't give a shit. V'ou
know, whatever the comment
cards said, tested audiences scored
it low. fhat's what matters in the
end.
I: Do you think you'll ever have the
kind ol freedom that you had with
"Evil Dead 2" again?

liC: Yeah — "Jack of All Trades." 1
was one of the exec producers so
they sort of tailored it for me. My
main goal was to get these two writ
ers I'd worked with on "Hercules"
and "Xena" that I thought
matched m\ sensibilities for that
genre. So we brought them on
board. We'd shot a bunch of stuff in
New Zealand and 1 was very famil
iar with New Zealand, so we decid
ed to do it there. After you've been
in television long enough, you
don't have to audition. At that
point, I'd ah ead) done "Hercules'"
and "Xena" for live years so I
didn't have to prove anything to
anybody. It was totally hands-olf,
and we had total creative control.
Good or bad, success or failure,
that's why I was happy to do that
show, because we could do am
thing we wanted. It was the perfe< t
creative situation, which was whv I
was willing to go to the frickin'
Southern Hemisphere to do it. lie
cause after a while, you've got to go
where you can do your work. As lai
as that show's concerned, though. I
just finished m\ first season and m\
last season. September 23rd, it just

got cancelled. Which is line. Rat
ings determine everything. Every
single show gets cancelled because
of low ratings — there's almost no
other reason.
I: Any chance it'll be picked up
again?
BC: No, because old TV shows
age like fish. No one wants to be
associated with television that's
been canceled.
I: Can you talk a little about being
t\ pet <ist as .in actor?
BC: An actor just wants to be an
actor. I've done a bunch of genre
stuff that's directly related to the
first "Kvil Dead" movie. You've
been in ,t couple of horror films so
it's like, "Let's get that gin who
does horror films." It's exciting at
first — I did some genre movies,
inosth science fiction, mostly hor
ror, and you fall into that trap. You
can either embrace it 01 fight
against it or do a little of both. It
helps you in that it you get in some
thing successful, you'll be known
lor something.
lint you also run the risk of
being stuck there. I have a lot of re
spect lor people like Sean (lonnery
a whole young generation
doesn't even know he was in the
bond films. It's an ama/ing thing
to overcome. Harrison Ford got
over the Indiana Jones thing and
the Stat Wars thing. But that's
pretty rare.
Reporters and news organiza
tions love to write "best known
loi." Everyone tries to get a handle
on "what is that person best known
loir" I hope I'm never best known
lot anything.
I: But do you think that you're best
known foi something?
BC.: Oil sure, the "Kvil Dead"
movies. And 1 have no problem
with that.
I: How did working on television
change your perception as a movie
actor?
BC: More people will see a low
rated television show in one night
than a whole run of a successful
movie. Even "Brisco County." I
found tli,it when I started to go to
conventions after that, a whole new
batch of people showed up. Not
the tattooed, spiked-haired, "Evil
Dead" goth crowd. It was little Billy
dressed as.»cowboy and a little girl
who owned a horse and wanted to
talk about horses. It was all a fami
ly thing. You're coming into their
homes lot free, and it allows you to
reach a whole new fan base.
1: So do you think you'd want more
of that type of greater recognition?

BC: Well, I'd hate to be a Tom
Cruise type where you have to
wear a disguise just to go to a
movie. They steal your kids. Weird
shit can happen.
I: So you'tl rather work in smaller
pictures?
BC.: I think it depends on tin- oi
lers. Some actors never want to
turn down work. But you have to
assert yourselfat some point. If you
don't say no, you lose all respect.

I hev should get rid of the ele( toral
college. Al (iore is running around
in Florida and Oeorge Bush is
hanging out Michigan and they re
both in Pennsylvania. I hey
shouldn't just worn about those
states; the\ should worn about
every state in the union if they
know that one shmuck pulling a
levet is going to mean something.
You can't ignore small states.
It's ridiculous. "()h, I ain't goin to
Alaska. I'hey ain't worth shit."
What kind of attitude is that?
Also, I'd like to see about a

press. I mean, granted, then "s ,i lot

two-part \ system has wa\ outlived
its usefulness.
I think we gotta really stai i kick

I: Anv (losing comments?
BC: No. Oh wait, yeah. Don't go to
a movie because you're told that it's
a "must see" film. There's no such
thing as a "must see" film. Go be
cause you really think it 'll be a good
film. Don't go because of stupid
quotes on the movies from some
unknown news source. I love it, all
the dot-dot-dots. "Great film dot
dot-dot, Spectacular dot-dot-dot."
It could have said "Great film fora
piece of shit. Spectacular disaster."
You know what I mean? It's all a
bunch of crap.
