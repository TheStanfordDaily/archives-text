# Bruce Campbell takes on the film industry, Stanford and Intermission editor Jung Lah. Who's laughing now?
## ‘Come get some!’ 
### JUNG LAH EDITORIAL STAFF 
"I'm a character actor trapped
in a leading-man's body," declared
Bruce Campbell, self-proclaimed
B-movie actor and star of the ( las
sie ( iilt horror films that make up
the "Evil Dead" trilogy. Campbell,
who went on to star in the short
lived television Western "1 he .Ad
ventures of Brisco County Jr." as
well the ollbeat period show " Jack
ol All Trades." admits to having
been typecast as a horror / sci-fi
character actor, and his roles in
low-budget films and short stints
on FV shows like "I'he X-Files"
,ind "Xena: Warrior Princess" only
continue to establish this label. I lis
tongue-in-cheek humor and sell
knowing sarcasm are fiercely
adored by his small but loyal fan
base, and mam Stanford admirers
of Bruce Campbell came out to
show their support for his on-cam
piis appearance last week.
On Halloween night, the Stan
lord Film Society held a screening
of "Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn" in
( aibberley Auditorium. I lie event
was co-sponsored by the ASS I.'
Speakers Bureau and the C.radu
ate Student ('.ouniil.
There was no denying the ex
citement of the crowd as ('.amphcll
walked out on state to introduce
the movie. He was greeted by a
standing ovation, and he proceed
ed to raffle off signed VI IS and
DVD copies of the "Evil Dead"
films before settling into the- audi
ence himself to watch the movie.
Making an occasional wisecrack or
two during the screening, he then

spent a good hour answering ques
tions from the crowd iu addition to
signing autographs for anyone
willing to wait in line. There is no
denying Campbell's appeal — he
is a genuinely nice guy who truly
appreciates his fans, and that's why
they love him like the one-handed,
chainsaw-wielding destroyer of
Deadites that he really is. Intermis
sion got the opportunity to sit
down with Bruce "Ash" Campbell
and ask him about bis work, the in
dustry and politics. I lere's what he
had to say.
Intermission: What's your opinion
about the < iill following that has
sprung up around the "Evil 1 )ead"
movies?
Bruce Campbell: I think it's great
that someone likes something
enough that they're going to watch
it over and over and over and
never get tired of it. That 's a good
sign. I have a theory that movies
that are hard to make are easy to
watch, and movies that are easv to
make are hard to watch, because
vou're not really putting enough
effort into it. We busted our ass on
all three of the "Evil Dead films,
and I think it shows.
Wlietliet you like the movies or
not. at least we worked hard.
There are plenty of people who do
not like those movies, and there are
plenty of people who should not
see those movies. You know, like all
the Scandinavians.
Kut really, I'm pleased that peo
ple like them. And I can trace my
every advance as an actor based on
what those movies provided foi me
as far as opportunities.

I: Which of the "Evil Dead" films
did you most enjoy working on?
BC: Probably part two because we
had enough mone\ to do it right,
we had enough experience to be
able to be better filmmakers, and
not enough studio intervention to
make it a nightmare.
I: So "Army of Darkness" had a lot
of studio intervention?
BC: It had a lot, yeah. We had to
reshoot the ending and we had to
recut the film. The original version
was 9(> minutes and what came out
was 81 minutes.
It wasn't playing that well to test
audiences, and they base every
thing on those stores. Hie shorter
they made [the movie], the

higher the stores were, so
the) just kept shortening it.
There's an element of truth
in that. In what I tall a dum
dum movie, which is "Army
of Darkness,'' we tut out
mostly the battle footage at
the end.
They would ask, "But it
you have six skeletons blow
ing up, why not just have
three? YVhv do you have to
have six?" So it was imnossi-

ble for us to defend the movie
when it i ante time to edit, flic stu
dios would say,"(ait that out," and
we could nevei argue, "hut that's
integral to the plot." And that was
our own shortcoming.
I: So they'd cut it even if you spent
mone\ 011 making the scenes?
BC: They don't give a shit. V'ou
know, whatever the comment
cards said, tested audiences scored
it low. fhat's what matters in the
end.
I: Do you think you'll ever have the
kind ol freedom that you had with
"Evil Dead 2" again?

liC: Yeah — "Jack of All Trades." 1
was one of the exec producers so
they sort of tailored it for me. My
main goal was to get these two writ
ers I'd worked with on "Hercules"
and "Xena" that I thought
matched m\ sensibilities for that
genre. So we brought them on
board. We'd shot a bunch of stuff in
New Zealand and 1 was very famil
iar with New Zealand, so we decid
ed to do it there. After you've been
in television long enough, you
don't have to audition. At that
point, I'd ah ead) done "Hercules'"
and "Xena" for live years so I
didn't have to prove anything to
anybody. It was totally hands-olf,
and we had total creative control.
Good or bad, success or failure,
that's why I was happy to do that
show, because we could do am
thing we wanted. It was the perfe< t
creative situation, which was whv I
was willing to go to the frickin'
Southern Hemisphere to do it. lie
cause after a while, you've got to go
where you can do your work. As lai
as that show's concerned, though. I
just finished m\ first season and m\
last season. September 23rd, it just
