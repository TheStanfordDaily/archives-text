" Requiem,"

is convincing. But I honestly
could not care about what hap
pened to most of the c haracters in
each case.
"Requiem" has a promising
premise: All of its central characters

have penchants for excess. Sara

Harry and Tyrone (Marlon

fact, are seen "borrowing" his
mom's TV during the opening
scenes and pawning it at a sidewalk
vendor.
These druggies are linked to
Marion (Jennifer Connelly, TV' s
" The Street"), who is I fairy's girl
friend. All of them share the joys
of shooting up or smoking out,
and eventually their get-rich
quick scheme involving drugs
gets them into a heap of trouble.
After the intriguing first third of
the film (a sequence titled "Sum

cheer or care about, aside from

Burstyn's moving performance.
Burstyn started her career
back in the 19505, with appear

"Gnnsmoke." But after her part
in " The Exorcist," she has been
underutilized by I lollywood. I lei
talents shine through here as .1
