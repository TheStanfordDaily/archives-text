# The 						'real' world MTV wants you to
## Two new 'Real World' videos go behind the scenes 0f... marketing! 
### CHRIS LEE 
I consider myself a hip guy. I try
lo keep up with pop culture. That
said, I'm s;id to admit that I never
had access to MTV in my youth.
That's right: no music videos, no
big-haired rock, stars and no quirky
TV shows like "The Real World,"
the precursor to the curt cut reality-
I'V trend that's been sweeping the

airwaves.
This, of course,
made me the per
fect candidate to
review two new
"Real World"
videos. Well, not
really; I'm just a
i r„_ ' ..i.

The Real World:
Greatest Fights;
The Real World You (wf
Never Saw: New Orleans
MTV Productions

sucker lor watch
ing free videos.
Besides, the press release
promised juicy material. "The
Real World: (ireatest Fights" and
" The Real World You Never Saw:
New Orleans" are being market
ed as "uncensored," "outrageous
outtakes" and "intimate mo
ments" of past seasons that
couldn't make it past MTV's
righteous censors. Needless to
say, I was excited. Uncensored
footage? I envisioned something
along the lines of Jerry Springer's
"Too I lot for TV."

What I got instead was a mixed
bag ol unseen footage and retro
spective analysis from old cast
members. "Greatest Fights" pro
vides an in-depth look at a few
choice skirmishes between house
mates of the past few seasons. The
video promises uncensored real
time footage, which basically
amounts to plenty of< ursing and a
split screen with a camera crew Ibl
lowing each combatant.

Meli s s a
vs. Dan in
Mia m i ,
Stephen vs.
Irene in Seat
tle, David vs.
Tatni in Los
Ange Ie s ,

Puck vs.
Pedro in San Francisco. . . these
lights are all meticulously dissen t
ed by the participants in new in
terviews. These conversations are
the most entertaining aspect <>l
the tape, as each instigator tries to
rationalize and laugh off the
seeming absurdity of his actions.
Even so, watching Stephen try
to defend his sexuality or Melissa
try to justify her nosiness makes
you wonder il such petulant fights
really merit this kind of attention.
Maybe "The Real World" is far

more popular than I'm giving it
credit lor, but "Greatest Fights"
only succeeds in making many of
its featured personalities look in
credibly juvenile.
File video ends with <111 homage
to Pedro, the charismatic San Fran
cisco housemate who apparently
rallied 1 lie entire countn around
his cause before dying ol \l I )S. I lis
roommate |udd looks back on their
time together ami even tours the
old house in the touching linale.
" I'he Real World You Never
Saw: New Orleans" is by far the
better ol the two tapes. Providing
unseen footage of the most recent
cast, this video gives a huh h more
intimate portrait of its house
mates. Whereas "Greatest Fights"

was too spread between multiple
seasons to get a feel for most indi
viduals, "New Orleans" reveals
the quirky side of each of its cast
members. Watch Julie driving,
Melissa impersonating her par
ents and overllowing a toilet,
Jamie playing with .1 dead fish . . .
it's entertaining without being
raucous or explicit.
Another highlight is when cast
mates comment on each other's
habits, ranging from hook-ups to
dance moves to singing; these
people have obviously gotten to
know each other very well. ()ddly
enough, the tape itu ludes very lit
tle coverage of Mardi Gras. I'm
assuming this is because the topic
was probably beaten to death in

regular season episodes.
Avid viewers of the show may
already know enough about these
characters to last a lifetime, hut
the New ()rleans tape actually de
livers on entertainment in this
area.
Though they are relatively
amusing, its dübious why anyone
would choose to purchase these
tapes. If you really are a die-hard
fan of "The Real World," your
money might he better spent at
MTV's Web site: Several items
from the New Orleans house are
currently up for auction.
As for me, I'll be continuing
my life of isolation from Ml V foi
the time being, ('able is just too
expensive.
