She had us, no doubt about it.
From the moment playwright Kve En
sler opened her mouth at the press open
ing of "The Vagina Monologues." her au
dience was transfixed. Not by the "din\
talk" that critics of the show claim ii to be,
hut by its own realization that the "V
-word" has been

shrouded lor way,
way too long.
The "Mono
logues" are the re
sult of some 200 <>l
Knsler's "vagina
interviews" with
women around
the world. She

talked to rape victims, old women, young
women (six-year-olds, believe it or not),
married women and lesbians. She asked
them frank questions and got Irank an
swers. The piece is a popular Valentine's
Day production at Stanford, and famous
actresses from Julianna Margulies to (lal
ista Flockhart have delivered them in a ro
tating showcase in New York City.

But to hear Ensler do them is a rare
treat. Novice actresses Irown as the\ tr\ to
get the tough monologues right; to see
stars do them is an experience inevitably
marred by the celebrity-ogling of it all. But

this is a pure experience. Kn
slei sits on a bar stool iu all
black, with bare feet. She is a
son of everyplaywright. The
audience lias no preconcep
tions'. It is a great setup for
observing En

sler's incredible
range and daring
as a comedic and
dramatic actress.
First, the
comedy. There's
lots of it, and Ku
sler's delivery
made a huge dif

ference in the audience's re
action. She leaps effortlessly
from accent to accent, chan

neling the spirits of the women into the au
ditorium.
Knsler shines in a hilarious piece that
demonstrates the sounds women make
when making love. Let's just say that you
must hear the "Jewish moan" and the

"WASP moan."
The show addresses the results ol ques
tions like "What would your vagina wear?"
.uul "What would your vagina sa> il it
could talk?' Closer to the end, Ensler

[What would I
your vagina say I
if it could talk? I

somehow manages to get the entire house
(with the exception of"the tight-lipped 70-
year-old man in tow C who didn't crack a
smile the whole show) yelling "Cunt!" in a
beatnik-poetic vocalization piece titled
"Reclaiming the Cunt."

One of the biggest bonuses to seeing
Ensler do her own work is the addition ol
her personal stories to the monologues.
She introduces each one with how she
came to interview the person, sometimes

recounting verbatim dialogue
from the interview (to the (">-
year-old: "What does your
vagina smell like?' Answer:
"Snowflakes"). She takes the
time to <|iiiet down the audi
ence with the story I)l'her nav
el to Bosnia before telling the
stories ol Bosnian rape camp
victims through a painful
monologue, l'he show is a bit
lopsided toward the humor
ous, but poignant stories still
come through.
In the end, Knsler
achieves something miraculous
with her tender ac count of the
birth of stepson Dylan McDer-

mott's child. She makes an
analogy that is so clear and compelling and
undeniable, n should have been around
lor ages. Hut it had to come through the
voice of Knsler.
It's shocking. It's adult. It's unforget
table. Go, and take a man with you.
