# 'Tragedy' haunts Old Union courtyard
## 
### MARIKA KNOWLES 
The Drama Department's pro
duction of The Revenger's
Tragedy, which opened on Hal
loween night, features James
I .yons directing a strong cast in the
performance of a wonderfully rib
ald play that defies definition as
exclusively black-comedy,
tragedy, or history.
I lie play chronicles the attempt
ol one morally questionable family
to gain revenge on another, equal
ly corruptible family.
I he path to revenge in this play
is scattered with scenes wrought
from various traditional genres
and tagged together, in a ridicu
lous, paradoxical jumble. We see
the anger of the bastard son, the
adulterous seduction, the court
trial, and even the quaint reconcil
iation of a mother and daughter
brought back to the path of virtue.
From the beginning of the play,
the viewer becomes devoid of sym
pathy for either side, recognizing
each family as a reflection of the
other. Still intriguing, though, are
the outlandish carryings-on of the
various individuals, as well as the
parody of familiar theatrical
themes.

Although Lyons' ambitious de
cision to set his prochu lion ol I lie
Revenger's Tragedy in ()ld I nion
(Courtyard is well taken, the con
straints set upon the performance

variable results.

completely hare.
Yet the outdoor setting provid
ed problems in terms of pacing
and the creation of tension. The
actors, wanting to he heard with
out the aural benefits of an indoor
theater, performed with superb
diction as they articulated and
sounded out every word. This
worked particularly well with the
voices of the performers, many of
which were deeply resonant and

suited to the meter.
I he detiimental effect, on the
other hand, was the creation of a
uniform pace in whi< li each line ol
verse, given exactly the same at
tention in terms ol diction, also
conveyed a similar, Hat emotion.
Lyons created several very in
teresting visual devices, in addi
tion to the impressive backdrop ol
the Old Union facade. Most ol

these devices lo
nised on the cre
ation ol mirrors or
re flee I ions t li.it
I ore s ha d o wed
certain events in
the play.
Karly in the play,
the Duke appears

in his sedan chair at the trial of his
wile's son junior. At the same mo
ment, the dead body of the man
whom Junior is accused of raping
appears stage-right. The appear
ance of this already-violated hody
foreshadows the duke's death and
the placement of his corpse in his
sedan chair lor display.
The presence ol the Duchesses'
gray dog (Lyons used a real ani
mal), which she leads around the
stage by a gold chain, foreshadows
an event later in the play when
Lussurioso reduces the Duchess to

a similar role of prisoner 01 cap
tive.
Lyons' creation ol the ghosts,
lour females clad in black body
suits with a white skeleton at
tached, also contributed to the vi
sual complexity of the perfor
mance. The ghosts often mirrored
the actions of the characters. In
one scene, as a character describes
the ultimate sexual seduction, he
goes to each ghost in turn and en
gages in a seductive, writhing
dance with each ghost.
In general, the presence ol the
ghosts in every scene, virtualh in
lieu ol any kind of set-piece, served
to intimate the overhanging pres
ence of evil and death. At the same
lime, that presence was mitigated
by the bawdy sexuality of the play,
,111 element reflected in the ghosts'
provocative and writhing dances.
Lyons put together a highly
qualified cast. Particularly com
mendable were the performances
of 'Shandy Danaye-Lhni, a senior
majoring in philosophy, and |iif
('larke, a senior majoring in the bi
ological sciences.
As (iratiana, Danaye-Llmi pro
jected a powerful mix of craftiness
and weakness that was reflected in
her excellent and suggestive body
movement, as well as the fantastic

variation <>l her voice from feigned
naivete to a seductive whisper.
In the role of Spnrio, Cllarke
created an interesting interpreta
tion of the bastard son. Clarke's
hunched posture and furtive
movements contributed to the im
pression of a suppressed bestialit\
•iikl sexual appetite. (llarke literal
Iv embodied the licentiousness
th.it spurred his conception, a li
eeutiousiiess that Sputio claims

I he play concludes on a shock
ing .ind quite ribald note, as the
entire cast of the play is killed oil in
quick succession by Vindice and
Hippolita, who die immediateh
afterwards and leave the kingdom
in the hands of Lady Antonia.
1 his scene, especially the en
trance of Antonia, who has played
a minor role in the body of the ac
tion, is a mock-up of the final scene
of tragedies like I lainlet, in which
all characters are killed and an
outsider enters to restore order.
Lyons cleverly subverts this
order in the final moment of the
play, as Lady Antonia, the incum
bent figure of stability, climbs into
her dead husband's lap and pro
ceeds to uncork a bottle of bubbly
champagne.

ed problems in terms of pacing
and the creation of tension. The
actors, wanting to he heard with
out the aural benefits of an indoor
theater, performed with superb
diction as they articulated and
sounded out every word. This
worked particularly well with the
voices of the performers, many of
which were deeply resonant and

suited to the meter.
I he detiimental effect, on the
other hand, was the creation of a
uniform pace in whi< li each line ol
verse, given exactly the same at
tention in terms ol diction, also
conveyed a similar, Hat emotion.
Lyons created several very in
teresting visual devices, in addi
tion to the impressive backdrop ol
the Old Union facade. Most ol

these devices lo

ation ol mirrors or

certain events in
the play.
Karly in the play,
the Duke appears

in his sedan chair at the trial of his
wile's son junior. At the same mo
ment, the dead body of the man
whom Junior is accused of raping
appears stage-right. The appear
ance of this already-violated hody
foreshadows the duke's death and
the placement of his corpse in his
sedan chair lor display.
The presence ol the Duchesses'
gray dog (Lyons used a real ani
mal), which she leads around the
stage by a gold chain, foreshadows
an event later in the play when
Lussurioso reduces the Duchess to

a similar role of prisoner 01 cap
tive.
Lyons' creation ol the ghosts,
lour females clad in black body
suits with a white skeleton at
tached, also contributed to the vi
sual complexity of the perfor
mance. The ghosts often mirrored
the actions of the characters. In
one scene, as a character describes
the ultimate sexual seduction, he
goes to each ghost in turn and en
gages in a seductive, writhing
dance with each ghost.
In general, the presence ol the
ghosts in every scene, virtualh in
lieu ol any kind of set-piece, served
to intimate the overhanging pres
ence of evil and death. At the same
lime, that presence was mitigated
by the bawdy sexuality of the play,
,111 element reflected in the ghosts'
provocative and writhing dances.
Lyons put together a highly
qualified cast. Particularly com
mendable were the performances
of 'Shandy Danaye-Lhni, a senior
majoring in philosophy, and |iif
('larke, a senior majoring in the bi
ological sciences.
As (iratiana, Danaye-Llmi pro
jected a powerful mix of craftiness
and weakness that was reflected in
her excellent and suggestive body
movement, as well as the fantastic

variation <>l her voice from feigned
naivete to a seductive whisper.
In the role of Spnrio, Cllarke
created an interesting interpreta
tion of the bastard son. Clarke's
hunched posture and furtive
movements contributed to the im
pression of a suppressed bestialit\
•iikl sexual appetite. (llarke literal
Iv embodied the licentiousness
th.it spurred his conception, a li
eeutiousiiess that Sputio claims
has been ingrained into his own
character.
I he play concludes on a shock
ing .ind quite ribald note, as the
entire cast of the play is killed oil in
quick succession by Vindice and
Hippolita, who die immediateh
afterwards and leave the kingdom
in the hands of Lady Antonia.
1 his scene, especially the en
trance of Antonia, who has played
a minor role in the body of the ac
tion, is a mock-up of the final scene
of tragedies like I lainlet, in which
all characters are killed and an
outsider enters to restore order.
Lyons cleverly subverts this
order in the final moment of the
play, as Lady Antonia, the incum
bent figure of stability, climbs into
her dead husband's lap and pro
ceeds to uncork a bottle of bubbly
champagne.
