the other players, invoking the
musical spirits to preside ovei the
evening and assuming a role ol

leader that he maintained
throughout the show (and even
after, as we saw him holding court
in a lo< al bar).
In all, there were four horns in
the brass section — two trumpets,
alto <md tenor sax. The lest ol the
group included guitar, bass guitar,
ke\s. drums, hand drums and two
vo< alists. ()nce everyone had found
theii spots, the sugary vocalists ap
proached theii mikes and launt bed
into a ja//\ vei sion ol spiritual song
dedicated to Alegwe.
At Yoshi's, vocals are some
thing ola rai it\ and although we
didn't mind the vocals at first, the
overall effect that tlie\ had on the
inusic didn't thrill us. In his all
white suit and glistening hair, the
lead vocalist projec ted something
of a low lat, mocha-almond feel
that, while <|iiite palatable lo the
upscale Yoshi's crowd, sent Bill to
the bar for another drink.
After the initial bout ol singing
and dancing In the two vocalists,
the show settled into a more t\ pi
cal ja/./. groove. There were some
great jams orchestrated by del

Puerto, vvlio had .1 way ol c ontort
ing his hotly ever\ lime he wanted
to c all attention to an arc ent in the
song. Ihe rest ol the group
seemed centered on his varied
lines — from deep funk to loping
jazz to intricate Afro-Cuban
rhytlnns — and let the hassist call
the order of solos. Some especial
ly hot interplay was had between
the bass and pianist 'I'ony Perez,
the rollicking replacement lor
('.hue ho Valdez.
Ihe brass kicked hard all
night, pulling oil some volcanic
hits behind the soloists and pro
viding rich hat monies in the song
heads. Kac h of the horn players
was <111 accomplished soloist as
well, which allowed for varied
music a I voices to contribute to the
overall sound.
()f particular interest was one
of trumpeters, who, with an up
ward bent bell and upper register
pyrotechnics (we won't mention
his boss mullet) gave a nod to
l)iz/\ (iillespie, the original im
porter ol Latin rhythms to the
jaz/ world.

After a brief and well-sung bal
lad In Maria Valdez (dhucho's
sister), the show went astray with
the reappearance of the male vo
calist. As the energized and flesh
ly groomed singers took front
stage, the band, which had been
playing fresh and intei esting mix
of music , broke out into a very
boring and typical cha-cha-cha
that had the added bonus of
being very long.
I low did all this time get spent
on this song? Well, first the two
vocalists started encouraging the
audience to enter into a call and
response w here they would sing a
phrase and the audience would
sing it back. After the crowd
demonstrated ample enthusiasm
and vocal ability, the satisfied vo
calists then encouraged us to
stand up and stait dancing the
cha-cha-cha.
So everyone got up, took off
their leather jac kcts. placed their
cell phones on the table for emer
gencies, hit their pric e\ beverages
hard and started trying to dance.
To see a normally sedate Yoshi's

bounce into late-night motion
was <i lirst for us and was a smiling
contrast to the room's usually
low-ke\ loot-tapping and head
nodding. Alter about 10 minutes
of darning to the same basic
rhythm, however, most people
sat down and the show promptly
ended. Though the appreciative
audience (lapped for several min
utes, we left without an encore.
1 "his was not the best show we've
ever seen at Yoshi's. In I act it was
probabh one of the worst.
Nonetheless, seeing a concert at
Yoshi's is alwavs great. Tickets, like
the drinks and sushi, are expensive,
unless you go during the week
when there are usually hall-price
student seats.
The dub always has interesting
,ind talented acts, and often times
world famous musk ians. before the
show, be sure to chill on the roof of
the parking garage with a view of
the bay, the cities and the I'ort of
()akland Kmpirial Walkers.
Yoshi's is an easy drive, in Oak
land right off the broadway exit on
880 North.

the reappearance of the male vo
calist. As the energized and flesh
ly groomed singers took front
stage, the band, which had been
playing fresh and intei esting mix
of music , broke out into a very
boring and typical cha-cha-cha
that had the added bonus of
being very long.
I low did all this time get spent
on this song? Well, first the two
vocalists started encouraging the
audience to enter into a call and
response w here they would sing a
phrase and the audience would
sing it back. After the crowd
demonstrated ample enthusiasm
and vocal ability, the satisfied vo
calists then encouraged us to
stand up and stait dancing the
cha-cha-cha.
So everyone got up, took off
their leather jac kcts. placed their
cell phones on the table for emer
gencies, hit their pric e\ beverages
hard and started trying to dance.
To see a normally sedate Yoshi's

bounce into late-night motion
was <i lirst for us and was a smiling
contrast to the room's usually
low-ke\ loot-tapping and head
nodding. Alter about 10 minutes
of darning to the same basic
rhythm, however, most people
sat down and the show promptly
ended. Though the appreciative
audience (lapped for several min
utes, we left without an encore.
1 "his was not the best show we've
ever seen at Yoshi's. In I act it was
probabh one of the worst.
Nonetheless, seeing a concert at
Yoshi's is alwavs great. Tickets, like
the drinks and sushi, are expensive,
unless you go during the week
when there are usually hall-price
student seats.
The dub always has interesting
,ind talented acts, and often times
world famous musk ians. before the
show, be sure to chill on the roof of
the parking garage with a view of
the bay, the cities and the I'ort of
()akland Kmpirial Walkers.
Yoshi's is an easy drive, in Oak
land right off the broadway exit on
880 North.
