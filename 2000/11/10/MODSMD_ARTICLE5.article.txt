# Fac Sen mulls over faculty housing
## 
### MARK DOMINIK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Discussion of faculty housing programs
dominated the Faculty Senate agenda at yester
day's meeting.
Ballooning real estate costs have Forced
Stanford to resort to innovative methods in
order to ensure that its faculty receives de
cent housing, Provost John Ktchemendy re
ported. Much of the problem with the real es
tate market lies in the astronomical size of a
standard down payment on a piece of Bay-
Area real estate.
In the current market, "a 20 percent down
payment is very very difficult [to make]. It's get
ting to the point where a 10 percent down pay
ment is difficult to come up with," Ktchemendy
said.
Stanford has paid a great deal of attention to

helping young faculty members afford to live
here, with mixed results.
Current programs include salary supple
ments. assistance with down payment and help
with loans. I he University has also built 028 ap
partments for fat uity and staff in the Stanford
West complex.
"The committee recommended that we find
some way to assist assistant professors, we've
decided to reduce the rent at Stanford West
down to 30 percent of their salaries."
Ktchemendy said.
Mathematics Prof. Ralph Cohen expressed
concern that the real estate market in the Bay
Area, even with the faculty assistance programs,
is not competitive with the market around
other universities.
However, other professors remain opti
mistic about the new programs." We have a new
assistant professor from (lambridge, Massachu

setts at Stanford West and he and his wile think
it's a fantastic place," s.iid Medical School Prof.
Judith Swain.
Even with Stanford's housing assistance,
"there's always a problem with people coming
from the outside, and there's a terror of taking
on $800,000 of debt, especially il they might get
turned down for tenure in six years,' said Psy
chiatry and Behavioral Sciences Prof. Alan
S< hat/berg.
However, most professors agree that the
"[faculty housing programs) turn what looks
like an impossible situation into an attractive
one," inthe words of Environmental Biology
Prof. Craig I leller.
