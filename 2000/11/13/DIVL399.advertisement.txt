Like the 1906 earthquake, serious illness or injury without health insurance can be a disaster.
Here's some basic Q and A's to
put you ahead of the game.
Q. Win/ do I need health
insurance?
A. Being uninsured puts you at
serious personal financial risk. A
single accident or illness could
cost you thousands of dollars. If
you were hit by a major injury or
illness, your studies could be
interrupted or ended due to
overwhelming medical bills.
That's why the University acquires
every student to be insured.
Q. How does Cardinal Care
work?
A. Through Cardinal Care
students combine their purchas
ing power so their plan can
negotiate better prices with the
insurance company, physicians
and hospitals. As the costs of
infrequent (and expensive) hospi
talizations are distributed among
many healthy students, Cardinal
Care achieves a balance of compre
hensive benefits and choice of
providers, along with low pre
miums and co-payments (the
share of the cost you pay when
you get care).
Q. How can I use Cardinal
Care most effectively?
A. To get the most value,
minimize your out-of-pocket
expenses, and help keep the
premium costs down:
■ Always carry your insurance
card with you.
■ Use on-campus medical care
and counseling whenever
possible. Start with Cowell
and CAPS, and get a referral
for additional care when
necessary. When you're away
from campus, use the Health
Net network for medical care.
Avoid out-of-network hospi
tals and clinicians when
possible.
■ For immediate treatment, use
Cowell until 8:00 pm
weekdays. It's open for
problems needing immediate
treatment from 10:00 am to
5:30 pm Saturdays, Sundays,
and holidays (except during
quarter breaks and summer).
■ Use the Emergency Room for
life-threatening conditions or
when Cowell is closed.
■ Choose a primary care
practitioner (PCP) at Cowell
and stick with him or her for
treatment and referrals. A
trusting relationship with your
own clinician results in more
individual care, better advice,
fewer tests, and greater
satisfaction.
■ Use Cowell's or other Health
Net pharmacies. Ask for
generic prescriptions. Avoid
brand name and heavily
advertised drugs when
possible (you're paying for
the advertising).
■ Know your benefits (see http://
card inalcare.stanford ,ed u).
Q. What if my health
insurance is through my parents
(or spouse)?
A. Most services including
medical appointments at Cowell
are free to all registered students
regardless of what insurance
they have. Always carry your
health insurance card and know
your basic benefits.
Find out if your plan restricts
non-emergency services while
you're at school (e.g.: specialist
consultations, outpatient surgery,
physical therapy). If it does, plan
accordingly. Alternatively,
consider Cardinal Care.
Q a Why doesn't Stanford
sponsor dental and vision
insurance for students?
A. Because these services are so
frequently used by students,
comprehensive coverage costs
more than students have
indicated they can afford. For
vision, Cardinal Care does
include one vision exam per year.
For dental care we recommend
seeing a discount provider yearly
(a list is available at Cowell).
Q* What are my options after
graduation?
A. If you're in Cardinal Care
you can stay on it after
graduation through August 31
by paying the premium through
that date (contact Student
Health Insurance Office: 723-
2135). The Alumni Office (723-
2021) offers health insurance
plans for recent Stanford
graduates. Note: Plans
accepting individual sub
scribers often require a medical
questionnaire to limit the
insurance company's risk, and
may choose to exclude you.
