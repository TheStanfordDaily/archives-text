Dear Berkeley and Stanford Campus Community and Friends,
The 103 rd Big Game is nearly upon us. Kickoff on November 18 will
continue one of the oldest, most storied traditions in the Bay Area.
Our two great universities have a rich heritage on the football field
and, more importantly, in our classrooms and laboratories.
This year, Big Game will be played in Memorial Stadium on the
University of California, Berkeley campus. Our goal for Big Game is
that it be well played on the field and enjoyable for all who attend.
It is indeed unfortunate that in the past few years the spirit of Big
Game has been tarnished by irresponsible behavior of a few that has
led to melee and property damage. Because those attending the
game should not have to fear for their safety, we wish to be very clear
that anyone who engages in incidents of physical assault or property
damage will be ejected from the game and criminal prosecution will
be sought. Students found responsible for such actions face discipli
nary action at their respective campuses, which could include
suspension or dismissal. If this athletic event cannot be conducted
in a safe manner for all, then we will strongly consider moving this
event to an off-campus neutral facility.
This, and every Big Game should be a worthy reflection of a century
of tradition. We invite all who attend to express their school spirit,
pride and sportsmanship by celebrating in a safe, positive and
friendly manner.
