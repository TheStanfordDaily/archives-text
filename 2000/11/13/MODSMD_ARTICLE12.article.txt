On November 13, 1935,'1 lie Daily ran
an arlit let ailed "Terman Lauds Superior
Child."
" 'Intellectual precocity is a favorable
rather than an unfavorable omen,' said
Lewis M. Terman during the Stanford
broadcast over radio station k( i() at Bo'
clock last night.
" The majority of the evidence to date in
Professor l erinan s most recent experiment
in psychology indicates that superior chil
dren become surperior adults, with the nat
ural exception of a few. 1 his is contrary to
the widespread opinion that the gifted child
turns out badly, becoming a psychopath or
an eccentric.
"Professor lerman pointed out that
more than hall of the boys and a large
proportion <>l the girls have entered or are
preparing to enter one of the professions —
law, medicine, engineering or leaching —
and that several arc dedicating their lives to
scientific research.
"Many of the girls get married on com
pleting their college course, and they usual
ly select husbands who are also blessed with
a brain."
Bottom line: A new, positive outlook for the gift
ed child — but then again, who ever said that
being an eccentric was bad?
