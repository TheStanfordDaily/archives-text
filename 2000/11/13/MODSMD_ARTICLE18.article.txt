## The
						Stanford Daily Major overhaul needed to get techies overseas 
### 
Published Since IS 1 ) I

IN I UK WAKE of the University's decision
to embark upon a $1-billion capital cam
paign, the Overseas Studies program re
cently announced its intention to expand
its global reach and student base. Due to the
unique opportunities tli.it overseas centers offer
in ,in inc i easingly globalized world, this initiative
will greatl\ enhance the education ol Stanford
students. I lowever, despite socio-political unrest
in potential campus locations, increasing the
number of overseas centers will he far easier than
attracting students from st ienceand engineering
majors.
Since Prof. Amos Nut became director of
Overseas Studies, he has discussed broadening
the program into China, the Middle East, India,
Alt it a .md the ('.aribbean. Furthermore, Nm has
spoken about increasing the number of science
majors who studv abroad (luring their Stanford
careers.

We applaud this effort for several reasons.
First, experience overseas serves as .in excellent
complement to the Stanford education by expos
ing students hands-on to new cultures about
which thev can only learn in books and classes
here in California. Indeed, study abroad tends to
both open doors to unexpected opportunities
.md open one's mind to novelty and exploration.
Second, there are many students on campus
mostly in the natural and physical sciences —
who want to go overseas, but remain held back by
the rigid requirements of their respective de
partments. 112 inally, and perhaps most important
ly, this expansion may spark interest among the
mass of students who never even consider the
value tli.it going abroad oilers.
Yet on account of the consuming demands of
majoring in science 01 engineering along with
the prevailing mentality of those departments,
Overseas Studies has its work cut out for it.

(•ranted, study abroad is not for everyone, nor
should students feci any pressure or expectation
to go. But this experience should be a viable op
lion for anyone.
As the foi mer head of the (Geophysics I)epart
inent, Nui is exceptionally well positioned to
deal with the restrictions particular to science
majors. 11c understands the legitimate concerns
of these students about fulfilling requirements
and graduating on time as well as the logistical
difficulty of taking certain classes in a foreign
language.
Moreover, Nur can engage the chairs of these
specific departments in discussions about the
possibility of both restructuring major require
ments and broadening the horizons of those stu
dents ;iihl faculty who (ail to recognize the value
cultural study in conjunction with science and
technology.
IVrhaps the most effective remedy to the

problem of getting tec hie majors abroad is infor
mation and outreach. II Overseas Studies intro
duced the notion of study abroad to all students
eai ly in their Stanford careers, students interest
ed in the sciences could plan their academic
schedules from the beginning to allow some flex
ibility that would enable them to learn in anoth
er country later on.
For example, an info session during fresh
man Orientation week that included tips for
prospective science majors would go a long way
toward ultimately facilitating the overseas expe
rience for more students from a broader variety
of disciplines.
Although Overseas Studies lias identified the
right goals, it must address the organizational
and psychological issues that prevent students
from going abroad. Educational experience
abroad remains too worthwhile to be a pipe
dream for Stanford tec hies.
