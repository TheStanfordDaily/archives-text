# TURNING AND TURNING
## The
						made-for-TV election 
### 
W ell, we certainly got what we
wanted: a close, exciting elec
tion with down-to-lhe-wire re
turns, twists, turns, .1 Holly
wood finish, eleven innings, referees in.ik
ing bad < alls, triple sudden-death overtime,
incessant instant rcplav, an underdog that
linalh made us want to vole, a host ol ann
< hail quarterbacks spewing superfluous
sideline commentary, nialapropisms galore
and .1 certain Florida county's 120 hours
(Â«iikl < ounling) ol lame.
And, at the same time, we didn't gel what

we wanted, not at all. In
stead ol an election, we
got <1 Super Bowl, or at
least a World Series that
more than one state
could get excited about.
In the end, we got exact
l\ w hat we deserved. Be
< ause we live in a world
where we think we

"know" celebrities personally, where what
we need to know is nothing compared to
what we want to know, is anyone surprised
that the most successful campaign lactic
during this election was ihe manipulation of
appearances? Striving lo appear presiden
tial grabbed more votes lor Hush than any
position 011 the issues ever did.
it seems that every < ouple ol months, we
complain about the media because it's giv
ing us something that we don't want, but eat
up anyway. And, even when we get out
raged. our indignation is quelled by (iNN's
self-reflexive (overage that blames itself for
screwing up while shoveling sensational de
tails at us like we're some sort ol profit-gen
erating steam engine.
Does ii bother anyone else that we can get
an entire (lav's news on a few pages of The
Daily and a lew more of I he New York limes
and, \et. 24-hour news networks always seem
to have something "newsworthy" to say?
Isn't it curious, someone asked, that a
deiiKx racy can produce such a stable result
(a nearl\ even 50/ ">() split)? It doesn't have
to be ( urious. (Consider how the candidates
have been treated since before the official
campaign began. Hush was .ill but crowned
president two years ago, and (iore's wooden
publi( persona was regularly discussed long
before his latest bid for the presidency.
Not long after, the roles reversed. (lore
became the "responsible statesman," and
Bush the "(global) village idiot." The
media threw its weight behind one, then
the other in order to give us something to
look forward to in the next hour's political
(overage. Is it any wonder thai the elec
tion results were so close?
It was supposed to have been the final

poll o! Election 20(H), the poll lo end .ill
polls. Except n wasn't. I lie polls kept com
ing. And now, nearh .1 week alier we voled,
we re still looking at polls. Whv? Because I lie
reporters tell us we now have a c risis, iniplv
ing that the election it sell is no longer an im
portant event. Instead, it's just another
opinion poll, whit li has been followed In in
numerable surveys asking people what the\
think and leel about who they voted lor.
At this point, it's hard to distinguish be
tween Bobbie Battista, host of C.N'N's
l alkback Live, and |err\ Springer. B.it
iisi.i\ show gathers an audience that exer
cises its right lobe heard by hissing at each
other over whether votes should be re
counted hand counted, or not counted.
Am viewer might get the impression that
your opinion and "feelings" matter more
than your actual vote, especially consider
ing that less than hallof us actuallv voted.
No wonder we have an Electoral ('.ollege.
Opinion swings 111 each direction, but the
networks never allow it to swing too lar be
cause then people might actiialh tear them
selves a\\.i\ from the- Television long enough
to make a difference. The media's doing ev
erything possible to ensure tli.it this countn
st.ivs divided right clown the middle so ili.it we
continue tuning in hour alter houi, dav after
day. Because the minute we see lads 111 the
news rather than ourselves and our reactions,
the game is over, and the media h.is to go back
to exciting us with stock market fluctuations.
I lie print media disappoints as well. I he
Associated Press issued two articles in two davs
that contradic ted each other. Hie first c ited .1
poll that claiming that most Americans wanted
a hand-count and felt that this entire episode
evinces the strength of American democ racy.
The other took a "human interest approach,
interviewing people who wished that we'd just
get this over with and pick <1 president because
the delay was irritating.
Irritating? We say this word as if this was
about us, like when they killed our mothers'
best friend, Princess Diana. Not to say "the
news" doesn't matter. I he results of ibis elec
tion will make a dillerenc e in at least one per
son's life. But separating the results from the
press' seesawing coverage remains the only
way that we can stop treating the election as en
tertainment instead of something real.
It may be dillicult to detach ourselves
from the excitement of overtime to step
back for long enough to make sense out of
the past week, but it's a worthwhile effort.
Because if we don't do it now, we're in lor
a future ol nothing but "crises."
