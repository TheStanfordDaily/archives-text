James Baker, the former secre
tary of state who is monitoring
Florida vote recounts for the Bush
team, told CNN.com that the au
tomatic recount and the addition
of absentee ballots which will
come in on Friday, should stand
as the final
recount effort.
"Voting machines are not Re
publican and are not Democratic,
and are not subject to conscious or
unconscious bias," Baker said.
But the Gore campaign
praised the election officials'
choices.
"It only confirms what we've
been saying all along. There is a
process in place to handle the re
count. We need to follow it, ( hi is
Lehane, Gore's chief spokesman,
told CNN.com.
Back on the Farm, Stanford

students are concerned that the
election results might affect future
citizen involvement in politics.
"There is growing anger and
disgust within the populace over
the nature of our system itself,"
said junior Sam Abrams, a mem
ber of the Stanford Republicans.
"It is probable that fewer numbers
will involve themselves in the po
litical process in the future."
However, Stanford Democrats
Chair krista Glaser, a senior,
thinks the election might encour
age more involvement.
"[Gore] has won the popular
vote and with all the problems in
Florida, we expect a re-vote that
will tell us what we know: Gore is
supported by the majority of
Americans," she said.
"1 hope that this election, with
all the controversy about whose
votes count, directly impacts
Stanford students so we can all
see that politics is relevant and
key in our
personal lives."
