Nader criticism went too far
John (iibbs look an awkward look back
ward m Ins N<>\. K column ("Nader's (ireen
I'ari\ is so< ialism dressed in new clothes'") as
he reminded us, in .1 McC.arthvesque style,
nl the horrors of Stalin's and Mao's failed at
tempts .11 Marxist ('ommunism and tried to
map those observations onto Ralph Nader's
political agenda.
Apparently, (libbs is confused about
the actual tenets ol Marxism, its diller
ences Itolll socialism and its connections to
the (ireen Party platform. I do not defend
Stalin's atrocities, but it is incorrect and ir
responsible to extend the failure of Soviet
('.ommunism to some moral judgment
that modern socialism is "evil."
I he terms socialism and communism
are not freely interchangeable, as (iibbs
seems think. In addition, (iibbs neglects
much of the actual historical and present
adaptation ol socialist doctrine and it's suc
cess in Kit rope under the welfare state. I
wonder, does (iibbs see the economic and
social policy 111 countries such as Germany,
France and Sweden .is "morally wrong"
and "economically disastrous."
As for Ralph Nader's ideas, 1 think lie is
right to address the extremely dispropor
tionate nature ol corporate influence in gov
ernment as well .is their impart on our soci
ety. (abbs argues against government regu
lation of business in favor of market-based
control. Would he agree then that we
should remove the government subsidies
and tax breaks given to business so that we

could have a true market based system?
And what about the failure of current
ec onomic models to assign any value to nat
ural resources or externalities? In .1 perfect
market, wouldn't those costs be properly ac -
counted lor? (libbs suggests that Nader's
plank for "Ecological Wisdom" would trans
late into restrictive environmental regula
tions forc ing businesses 10 adopt expensive
and inefficient tec hnologies.
I lie opposite is proven to be true.
When corporations are laced with paying
lor their negative social and environmen
tal externalities, they suddenly find tec h
nologies and production processes that
are far more efficient and that return
enormous savings on costs such as energy.
Lastly, 1 must address Gibbs' most in
sulting insinuation that those who voted
lot Nader in the recent election had not
read his platlorm and c ast their vote out ol
apathy. Ihe apathetic do not vote. (liti
/ens that were concerned, active and
probably better informed as a group,
made a choice to support the (Ireen Party.

Grape boycott a matter of basic humanity
I am writing this letter to entourage
you to take a stand and vote against the
serving ol grapes in Stanford's dining
halls. I lie 1994 hunger strikers have given
us a significant power to choose to support
the boycott of grapes. I applaud the Uni

versity's effort in recognizing our voice.
Now is the time lor our voice to be heard.
During Ihe week of Nov. 13 to 17, the
issue is in our hands and I he outcome de
pends on our educated vote. I hat's right,
I s.iid educated. We are all at this institu
tion because we are among the brightest
in the nation, and tlu> world for that mat
ter. In light of this we have an incredible
opportunity and it is out duty to voice our
opinions.
Personally, I hold the grape boycott in
high esteem because, like many Stanford
students on campus, 1 reali/e it is not about
having the sweet fruit to eat. No. The issue
is much deeper. It is not an issue of fruit, or
unions trying to get support and money by
boycotting major growers. The issue at
hand is human rights. It could have been
any fruit or vegetable, it could have been ap
ples! But the fact is that the people aflected
are those who work in the grape fields.
Supporters of tlie grape boycott feel so
strongly about the issue because there are
thousands of real people being exploited.
Made to work from dawn till dusk, wear
ing layers of dot lung to protect themselves
from the sun, the farmworkers who pick
the grapes face a terrible threat. Besides
horrible facilities, long hours, backbreak
ing work in the hot sun and a less than
minimum wage salary, they face the car
cinogenic pesticides that permeate the air,
water and even the fruit in the fields.
What kind of decent person would
knowingly place another human being in
such conditions? I lie slave-like work envi
ronment was simply not enough lor the
growers to be happy. I lie yield on grapes
must be more. Whv risk declining costs due
to some pesky little msec is. right?
It is far easier to spend a little extra
monev on pesticides that kill these iin\ an
imals to save more of the c rop and put a
nice wad ol cash in the pocket book. \\ li\
not? I'll tell you why. Doing ibis exposes
the workers to these carcinogens and c aus
es asthma, birth defects, cancer, nose
bleeds and severe headaches amongst a
majority of the workers!
It is like a slow biological warfare on
their workforce. I lie farmworkers are in
the fields long enough lobe exposed to I he
point where serious side eflects become
blaianth apparent and then they must
leave their job. N< > harm done to the grow
ers. Simply replace them with more work
ers in the same conditions and expose
I lie-in to the same pesticides.
I ley, wli) not? Most ol the workers are
immigrants and have a fear ol being re
ported, so 11 icy surelv will not speak out
against you. Since they live in that leai the
growers can play oil ol it and give tliem
less than minimum wage, batch enough
to keep alive but well enough to keep
working. Exposing them to toxic chemi
cals is no big deal because they're blind to
the ellec tsand, when they become ill, tliey
fear going to the hospital because of the
expensive bill so the) remain cjuiet. You
surely would not inform them that they
would receive workers compensation be
cause, let's face it. profit reigns. That's the
whole reason to use pestic ides in the first
place.
So we have an endless, malicious cycle
that will not slop unless the squeeze is put
on the grape growers. 1 he larmworkers
deserve a better life than the one they are
receiving today. Kven as you read ibis
there are thousands sullering under the
conditions listed above. W ill vnu sii by and
not voice your opinion? Is the delectable
luxurious little green grape you crave
worth all ol that hurt and sullei ing of oth
ers? You decide. Be educated. Be true to
yourself. Do not be selfish. Make a small
sacrifice fora great cause.
So, Stanford, let your voice be heard
loud and dear. Show your (ompassion for
humanity and vote to boycott grapes. Now
is the time to let the grape growers know
that we will not stand lor the harsh treat
ment of our fellow human beings. I )emon
strate, through your vote, that you know
what thev are doing and you will not sup

port their inhumane policies.

Pesticides harm people and environment
I am very iouterned about the indiflerence
and hostility that Stanford students have
shown towards die issue ol the grape boycott.
Many students ignorant I v believe that the issue
does not aflect tliem because they are not di
rectlv involved. Nevertheless. Stanford siu
dents should be concerned with the (irape
Boycott issue for two reasons: Pesticides allect
us ;ill (if we are farm workers or not), and, as
members of the Stanford community, we
should support the worthwhile struggles that
concern the members of our communih.
As a biotechnology student and future
health care provider. I am very aware ol the
detrimental eflects of pesticides. Pesticides
can drift 50 or more meters from the site
they are implemented. Furthermore, the\
contaminate water, air and soil several miles
from the fields w here they are used. ()ur en
vironment , as .1 result, is irrevocably aliened
In pesticide induced bio-build up.
Along with damaging our environ
ment, pestic ides have adverse effects on
human health. For example, multiple al
lergies are inllained by the widespread use
of pesticides. Last year alone, each Ameri
can was exposed to a teaspoon (10 grams)
ol pesticides. In California a lot of those
pesticides came from grape fields, which
are prominent in Sonoma and Napa.
Moreover, the eflects of pesticides on
farm workers and people who live near farm
fields is exponential!) worse, because the)
are commonly in direct contact with pesti
cides. Birth defects, cancer, severe allergic
reactions and poisoning .ire but a lew ol the
health conditions workers display .is a result
of pesticide exposure. 1 lowever, these nega
tive environmental and health elfec is < an be
prevented at low cost.
Many ellective means ol pest control
presently exist in the I nited Stales. Biotech
nology presently oilers alternative pest < <>n
trol methods, which are environmentally
safe and have little or no incidence ol health
risk. (ieiieiicallv engineered crops, foi ex
ample, can produce their own pesticides,
which reduce the need lor multiple pesti
cide implementation, and spec ilicalh attack
the pest species of choice. Moreover, these
alternative means are much more econonii
( ally sound in the long run, which means it
is not unreasonable for us to ask that grape
growers revise their means ol pest control.
Stanford's community is one lli.it fos
ters tolerance and informed actions
among its members. Whether we support,
oppose or are neutral with respect to the
grape boycott, as tolerant and informed

individuals, we should respect others' ef
forts to promote and implement the grape
boycott.
I lie grape boycott is a universal issue
because it deals with worker's rights and,
more generally, human rights. There is
nothing beneficial about widespread pesti
cide use, except for those who make a
profit ol the side of grapes at the expense
of the environment, our health and the
larni workers' lives. H\ supporting the ban
ol grapes on campus, we make it clear to
grape growers that we are not willing to
s,k rilice our environment and our health
so that they can turn .1 profit.
Kllectively, the grape boycott will pres
sure grape growers to improve working
conditions and use alternative methods of
pest control, siinplv by refusing to consume
such .1 substitutable fruit as grapes. I strong
l\ urge you to join me in the struggle for hu
mane treatment of farm workers and the use
of alternative pest control. Support basic
human rights to "life, liberty" and the re
moval of grapes from our dining halls.

Daily misrepresents CDC efforts
I lie issues raised b\ Ihe Daily's editorial
of Oct. IS ("Corporate culture consumes
oui campus") regarding the perceived 1111-
halancc of employers who seek to hire Stan
ford graduates, while legitimate, need to be
clarified. Quite simply, many Stanford siu
dents are highly coveted In employers, both
technical and non-teclmical alike.
I nfortunately, main students and
othei members of the Stanford communi
ty, including members of the Daily Edito
rial Hoard, have developed an erroneous
pen eption that the corporate world dom
inates the locus of the Career Develop
ment Centet in assisting students with
their career support needs.
While the perception does, indeed,
exist, there is good reason lor it. Starling
with 1 lie Daily itself, the number of adver
tisements In corporate recruiters seems al
tnost overwhelming at times and some is
sues are so full of recruiting ads by invest
ment banking, management consulting
and ic( linical linns that ilic paper appears
to be a directol vof corporate Americ a.
I'nfortunately, public service, non
profit and govei nmental organizations do
not typically advertise in student newspa
pers, both because of low recruiting bud
gels and because of different recruiting
strategies than their corporate counter
parts. In short, the types, as well the vol
ume, of ads that I he I)ail\ chooses to run
onlv reinforce the perception ola "corpo
rate culture" 011 this campus.

I he CDC is very sensitive to the needs of
non-teclmical students and their career in
terests in non-profit and government orga
nizations, as well as in the media and pub
lishing industry, entertainment, etc. Last
spring, and in collaboration with the Junior
('.lass Presidents, the CDC polled all juniors
to gel feedback about employers they would
like us to "recruit " to campus for career fairs,
Cardinal Recruiting and other programs.
While only 172 juniors responded with
their employer "wish list," the CDC at
tempted to contact each and every em
plover suggested and invited them to use
any of the services of the CDC, including
career fairs, Cardinal Recruiting, full-time
and part-time job listings, internship an
nouncements, career programs and pan
els and shadowing opportunities.
The problem we encounter is that these
organizations generally do not actively re
cruit on college campuses, and their hiring
strategies are not the same as employers'
who are experiencing growth and expan
sion, or whose skill sets are difficult to find.
For this reason, the CDC has dedicated a rel
atively voluminous section of the c areer re
source center to non-profit, government
«ind public interest careers and employers.
In addition, Liberal Arts Career Week
was created to address the needs of those
students seeking c areers outside of tech
nology, investment banking and consult
ing. F.ven though il takes place during
winter quarter, the timing fits better with
the typical "recruiting" and hiring strate
gies of those organizations. We simply
can't get most of the organizations who
hire liberal arts students to come to c am
pus any earlier in the year, and those who
do come do so as a result of a great deal of
time .iiid effort invested by the CDC staff.
In an attempt to immediately accom
modate the recruiting needs of under-rep
resented employers, should they wish to
conduct on-campus interviews, the CDC
has begun reserving a percentage of the
CDC interview rooms during the peak on
campus recruiting season. Our hope is
that employers of liberal arts students who
typically hire spontaneously will be able to
obtain interview space when they need it.
Due to the small number of interview
rooms at the CDC and the unavailability
of space ac ross campus, on-campus inter
view sc hcdulcs fill nearly six months 111 ad
vance of the academic year. In fact, the
( l)( 1 cannot meet the interview schedule
requests of many employers who wish to
access Stanford students.
We are, however, endeavoring to in
sure that interview rooms are available lor
employers seeking to hire liberal arts and
other non-technical majors when they
need them. This year alone, we turned
away over 100 employers in over-repre
sented fields while saving space 101 under

represented employers.
I nfortunately, many of these "reserved"
rooms go unused because under represent
ed employers generally do not interview on
campus. In addition, because students from
under-represented programs often erro
neously perceive that we do not serve their
fields of interest, when we are able to attract
under represented employers to campus,
their schedules often go unfilled.
In addition to reserving space for
under-represented employers for Cardi
nal Recruiting, the CDC holds a percent
age of tables aside during career fairs for
employers seeking candidates for fields
other than investment banking, manage
ment consulting and high tech. The CDC
also collaborates with Ivy League schools
to sponsor a Virtual Career Fair that
specifically seeks under-represented em
ployers and career fields.
Finally, it is important to remember that
the mission of the ( IX' is not to be a "place
ment service." We exist to provide students
with the skills and the knowledge they need
to make effective career and employment
decisions. Included in the development of
career skills is helping students learn how to
network, research and approach employers
who meet their interests, skills and values.
Bv virtue of the demand by .ill employers
for specific skill sets, some students and ma
jors will be in greater demand than others.
Ihe demand lor students with technical
skills is particularly pervasive in this econo
my and in this region. The CDC is particu
larly committed to assisting students whose
majors and skills appeal to be more chal
lenging to market to prospective employers.
Students from under-represented ma
jors need to understand, however, that
while there are excellent jobs available for
them, they must be more energetic and
focused in their career research and em
ployment dibits.
As a marketing tool for CDC programs,
I lie Daily is an excellent vehicle to help
eliminate the perception ihat the CDC fa
vors the corporate world. If the editorial
stall is serious about their concerns fora
more balanced representation of employers
or greater support for non-tech students,
they should be more willing to work with the
CDC stall to write articles or provide other
means for advertising the full spectrum of
our services and career opportunities.
1 1istorit ally, it has been difficult to get the
degree of coverage that demonstrates our
commitment to all of the career interests and
options ol Stanford students. II The Daily is
willing to work with us, I believe we can
make significant improvements in address
ing the "under-represented' career inter
ests of Stanford students.

winter quarter, the timing fits better with
the typical "recruiting" and hiring strate
gies of those organizations. We simply
can't get most of the organizations who
hire liberal arts students to come to c am
pus any earlier in the year, and those who
do come do so as a result of a great deal of
time .iiid effort invested by the CDC staff.
In an attempt to immediately accom
modate the recruiting needs of under-rep
resented employers, should they wish to
conduct on-campus interviews, the CDC
has begun reserving a percentage of the
CDC interview rooms during the peak on
campus recruiting season. Our hope is
that employers of liberal arts students who
typically hire spontaneously will be able to
obtain interview space when they need it.
Due to the small number of interview
rooms at the CDC and the unavailability
of space ac ross campus, on-campus inter
view sc hcdulcs fill nearly six months 111 ad
vance of the academic year. In fact, the
( l)( 1 cannot meet the interview schedule
requests of many employers who wish to
access Stanford students.
We are, however, endeavoring to in
sure that interview rooms are available lor
employers seeking to hire liberal arts and
other non-technical majors when they
need them. This year alone, we turned
away over 100 employers in over-repre
sented fields while saving space 101 under

represented employers.
I nfortunately, many of these "reserved"
rooms go unused because under represent
ed employers generally do not interview on
campus. In addition, because students from
under-represented programs often erro
neously perceive that we do not serve their
fields of interest, when we are able to attract
under represented employers to campus,
their schedules often go unfilled.
In addition to reserving space for
under-represented employers for Cardi
nal Recruiting, the CDC holds a percent
age of tables aside during career fairs for
employers seeking candidates for fields
other than investment banking, manage
ment consulting and high tech. The CDC
also collaborates with Ivy League schools
to sponsor a Virtual Career Fair that
specifically seeks under-represented em
ployers and career fields.
Finally, it is important to remember that
the mission of the ( IX' is not to be a "place
ment service." We exist to provide students
with the skills and the knowledge they need
to make effective career and employment
decisions. Included in the development of
career skills is helping students learn how to
network, research and approach employers
who meet their interests, skills and values.
Bv virtue of the demand by .ill employers
for specific skill sets, some students and ma
jors will be in greater demand than others.
Ihe demand lor students with technical
skills is particularly pervasive in this econo
my and in this region. The CDC is particu
larly committed to assisting students whose
majors and skills appeal to be more chal
lenging to market to prospective employers.
Students from under-represented ma
jors need to understand, however, that
while there are excellent jobs available for
them, they must be more energetic and
focused in their career research and em
ployment dibits.
As a marketing tool for CDC programs,
I lie Daily is an excellent vehicle to help
eliminate the perception ihat the CDC fa
vors the corporate world. If the editorial
stall is serious about their concerns fora
more balanced representation of employers
or greater support for non-tech students,
they should be more willing to work with the
CDC stall to write articles or provide other
means for advertising the full spectrum of
our services and career opportunities.
1 1istorit ally, it has been difficult to get the
degree of coverage that demonstrates our
commitment to all of the career interests and
options ol Stanford students. II The Daily is
willing to work with us, I believe we can
make significant improvements in address
ing the "under-represented' career inter
ests of Stanford students.

Nader criticism went too far
John (iibbs look an awkward look back
ward m Ins N<>\. K column ("Nader's (ireen
I'ari\ is so< ialism dressed in new clothes'") as
he reminded us, in .1 McC.arthvesque style,
nl the horrors of Stalin's and Mao's failed at
tempts .11 Marxist ('ommunism and tried to
map those observations onto Ralph Nader's
political agenda.
Apparently, (libbs is confused about
the actual tenets ol Marxism, its diller
ences Itolll socialism and its connections to
the (ireen Party platform. I do not defend
Stalin's atrocities, but it is incorrect and ir
responsible to extend the failure of Soviet
('.ommunism to some moral judgment
that modern socialism is "evil."
I he terms socialism and communism
are not freely interchangeable, as (iibbs
seems think. In addition, (iibbs neglects
much of the actual historical and present
adaptation ol socialist doctrine and it's suc
cess in Kit rope under the welfare state. I
wonder, does (iibbs see the economic and
social policy 111 countries such as Germany,
France and Sweden .is "morally wrong"
and "economically disastrous."
As for Ralph Nader's ideas, 1 think lie is
right to address the extremely dispropor
tionate nature ol corporate influence in gov
ernment as well .is their impart on our soci
ety. (abbs argues against government regu
lation of business in favor of market-based
control. Would he agree then that we
should remove the government subsidies
and tax breaks given to business so that we

could have a true market based system?
And what about the failure of current
ec onomic models to assign any value to nat
ural resources or externalities? In .1 perfect
market, wouldn't those costs be properly ac -
counted lor? (libbs suggests that Nader's
plank for "Ecological Wisdom" would trans
late into restrictive environmental regula
tions forc ing businesses 10 adopt expensive
and inefficient tec hnologies.
I lie opposite is proven to be true.
When corporations are laced with paying
lor their negative social and environmen
tal externalities, they suddenly find tec h
nologies and production processes that
are far more efficient and that return
enormous savings on costs such as energy.
Lastly, 1 must address Gibbs' most in
sulting insinuation that those who voted
lot Nader in the recent election had not
read his platlorm and c ast their vote out ol
apathy. Ihe apathetic do not vote. (liti
/ens that were concerned, active and
probably better informed as a group,
made a choice to support the (Ireen Party.

Grape boycott a matter of basic humanity
I am writing this letter to entourage
you to take a stand and vote against the
serving ol grapes in Stanford's dining
halls. I lie 1994 hunger strikers have given
us a significant power to choose to support
the boycott of grapes. I applaud the Uni

versity's effort in recognizing our voice.
Now is the time lor our voice to be heard.
During Ihe week of Nov. 13 to 17, the
issue is in our hands and I he outcome de
pends on our educated vote. I hat's right,
I s.iid educated. We are all at this institu
tion because we are among the brightest
in the nation, and tlu> world for that mat
ter. In light of this we have an incredible
opportunity and it is out duty to voice our
opinions.
Personally, I hold the grape boycott in
high esteem because, like many Stanford
students on campus, 1 reali/e it is not about
having the sweet fruit to eat. No. The issue
is much deeper. It is not an issue of fruit, or
unions trying to get support and money by
boycotting major growers. The issue at
hand is human rights. It could have been
any fruit or vegetable, it could have been ap
ples! But the fact is that the people aflected
are those who work in the grape fields.
Supporters of tlie grape boycott feel so
strongly about the issue because there are
thousands of real people being exploited.
Made to work from dawn till dusk, wear
ing layers of dot lung to protect themselves
from the sun, the farmworkers who pick
the grapes face a terrible threat. Besides
horrible facilities, long hours, backbreak
ing work in the hot sun and a less than
minimum wage salary, they face the car
cinogenic pesticides that permeate the air,
water and even the fruit in the fields.
What kind of decent person would
knowingly place another human being in
such conditions? I lie slave-like work envi
ronment was simply not enough lor the
growers to be happy. I lie yield on grapes
must be more. Whv risk declining costs due
to some pesky little msec is. right?
It is far easier to spend a little extra
monev on pesticides that kill these iin\ an
imals to save more of the c rop and put a
nice wad ol cash in the pocket book. \\ li\
not? I'll tell you why. Doing ibis exposes
the workers to these carcinogens and c aus
es asthma, birth defects, cancer, nose
bleeds and severe headaches amongst a
majority of the workers!
It is like a slow biological warfare on
their workforce. I lie farmworkers are in
the fields long enough lobe exposed to I he
point where serious side eflects become
blaianth apparent and then they must
leave their job. N< > harm done to the grow
ers. Simply replace them with more work
ers in the same conditions and expose
I lie-in to the same pesticides.
I ley, wli) not? Most ol the workers are
immigrants and have a fear ol being re
ported, so 11 icy surelv will not speak out
against you. Since they live in that leai the
growers can play oil ol it and give tliem
less than minimum wage, batch enough
to keep alive but well enough to keep
working. Exposing them to toxic chemi
cals is no big deal because they're blind to
the ellec tsand, when they become ill, tliey
fear going to the hospital because of the
expensive bill so the) remain cjuiet. You
surely would not inform them that they
would receive workers compensation be
cause, let's face it. profit reigns. That's the
whole reason to use pestic ides in the first
place.
So we have an endless, malicious cycle
that will not slop unless the squeeze is put
on the grape growers. 1 he larmworkers
deserve a better life than the one they are
receiving today. Kven as you read ibis
there are thousands sullering under the
conditions listed above. W ill vnu sii by and
not voice your opinion? Is the delectable
luxurious little green grape you crave
worth all ol that hurt and sullei ing of oth
ers? You decide. Be educated. Be true to
yourself. Do not be selfish. Make a small
sacrifice fora great cause.
So, Stanford, let your voice be heard
loud and dear. Show your (ompassion for
humanity and vote to boycott grapes. Now
is the time to let the grape growers know
that we will not stand lor the harsh treat
ment of our fellow human beings. I )emon
strate, through your vote, that you know
what thev are doing and you will not sup

port their inhumane policies.

Pesticides harm people and environment
I am very iouterned about the indiflerence
and hostility that Stanford students have
shown towards die issue ol the grape boycott.
Many students ignorant I v believe that the issue
does not aflect tliem because they are not di
rectlv involved. Nevertheless. Stanford siu
dents should be concerned with the (irape
Boycott issue for two reasons: Pesticides allect
us ;ill (if we are farm workers or not), and, as
members of the Stanford community, we
should support the worthwhile struggles that
concern the members of our communih.
As a biotechnology student and future
health care provider. I am very aware ol the
detrimental eflects of pesticides. Pesticides
can drift 50 or more meters from the site
they are implemented. Furthermore, the\
contaminate water, air and soil several miles
from the fields w here they are used. ()ur en
vironment , as .1 result, is irrevocably aliened
In pesticide induced bio-build up.
Along with damaging our environ
ment, pestic ides have adverse effects on
human health. For example, multiple al
lergies are inllained by the widespread use
of pesticides. Last year alone, each Ameri
can was exposed to a teaspoon (10 grams)
ol pesticides. In California a lot of those
pesticides came from grape fields, which
are prominent in Sonoma and Napa.
Moreover, the eflects of pesticides on
farm workers and people who live near farm
fields is exponential!) worse, because the)
are commonly in direct contact with pesti
cides. Birth defects, cancer, severe allergic
reactions and poisoning .ire but a lew ol the
health conditions workers display .is a result
of pesticide exposure. 1 lowever, these nega
tive environmental and health elfec is < an be
prevented at low cost.
Many ellective means ol pest control
presently exist in the I nited Stales. Biotech
nology presently oilers alternative pest < <>n
trol methods, which are environmentally
safe and have little or no incidence ol health
risk. (ieiieiicallv engineered crops, foi ex
ample, can produce their own pesticides,
which reduce the need lor multiple pesti
cide implementation, and spec ilicalh attack
the pest species of choice. Moreover, these
alternative means are much more econonii
( ally sound in the long run, which means it
is not unreasonable for us to ask that grape
growers revise their means ol pest control.
Stanford's community is one lli.it fos
ters tolerance and informed actions
among its members. Whether we support,
oppose or are neutral with respect to the
grape boycott, as tolerant and informed

individuals, we should respect others' ef
forts to promote and implement the grape
boycott.
I lie grape boycott is a universal issue
because it deals with worker's rights and,
more generally, human rights. There is
nothing beneficial about widespread pesti
cide use, except for those who make a
profit ol the side of grapes at the expense
of the environment, our health and the
larni workers' lives. H\ supporting the ban
ol grapes on campus, we make it clear to
grape growers that we are not willing to
s,k rilice our environment and our health
so that they can turn .1 profit.
Kllectively, the grape boycott will pres
sure grape growers to improve working
conditions and use alternative methods of
pest control, siinplv by refusing to consume
such .1 substitutable fruit as grapes. I strong
l\ urge you to join me in the struggle for hu
mane treatment of farm workers and the use
of alternative pest control. Support basic
human rights to "life, liberty" and the re
moval of grapes from our dining halls.

Daily misrepresents CDC efforts
I lie issues raised b\ Ihe Daily's editorial
of Oct. IS ("Corporate culture consumes
oui campus") regarding the perceived 1111-
halancc of employers who seek to hire Stan
ford graduates, while legitimate, need to be
clarified. Quite simply, many Stanford siu
dents are highly coveted In employers, both
technical and non-teclmical alike.
I nfortunately, main students and
othei members of the Stanford communi
ty, including members of the Daily Edito
rial Hoard, have developed an erroneous
pen eption that the corporate world dom
inates the locus of the Career Develop
ment Centet in assisting students with
their career support needs.
While the perception does, indeed,
exist, there is good reason lor it. Starling
with 1 lie Daily itself, the number of adver
tisements In corporate recruiters seems al
tnost overwhelming at times and some is
sues are so full of recruiting ads by invest
ment banking, management consulting
and ic( linical linns that ilic paper appears
to be a directol vof corporate Americ a.
I'nfortunately, public service, non
profit and govei nmental organizations do
not typically advertise in student newspa
pers, both because of low recruiting bud
gels and because of different recruiting
strategies than their corporate counter
parts. In short, the types, as well the vol
ume, of ads that I he I)ail\ chooses to run
onlv reinforce the perception ola "corpo
rate culture" 011 this campus.

I he CDC is very sensitive to the needs of
non-teclmical students and their career in
terests in non-profit and government orga
nizations, as well as in the media and pub
lishing industry, entertainment, etc. Last
spring, and in collaboration with the Junior
('.lass Presidents, the CDC polled all juniors
to gel feedback about employers they would
like us to "recruit " to campus for career fairs,
Cardinal Recruiting and other programs.
While only 172 juniors responded with
their employer "wish list," the CDC at
tempted to contact each and every em
plover suggested and invited them to use
any of the services of the CDC, including
career fairs, Cardinal Recruiting, full-time
and part-time job listings, internship an
nouncements, career programs and pan
els and shadowing opportunities.
The problem we encounter is that these
organizations generally do not actively re
cruit on college campuses, and their hiring
strategies are not the same as employers'
who are experiencing growth and expan
sion, or whose skill sets are difficult to find.
For this reason, the CDC has dedicated a rel
atively voluminous section of the c areer re
source center to non-profit, government
«ind public interest careers and employers.
In addition, Liberal Arts Career Week
was created to address the needs of those
students seeking c areers outside of tech
nology, investment banking and consult
ing. F.ven though il takes place during
winter quarter, the timing fits better with
the typical "recruiting" and hiring strate
gies of those organizations. We simply
can't get most of the organizations who

because it deals with worker's rights and,
more generally, human rights. There is
nothing beneficial about widespread pesti
cide use, except for those who make a
profit ol the side of grapes at the expense
of the environment, our health and the
larni workers' lives. H\ supporting the ban
ol grapes on campus, we make it clear to
grape growers that we are not willing to
s,k rilice our environment and our health
so that they can turn .1 profit.
Kllectively, the grape boycott will pres
sure grape growers to improve working
conditions and use alternative methods of
pest control, siinplv by refusing to consume
such .1 substitutable fruit as grapes. I strong
l\ urge you to join me in the struggle for hu
mane treatment of farm workers and the use
of alternative pest control. Support basic
human rights to "life, liberty" and the re
moval of grapes from our dining halls.

Daily misrepresents CDC efforts
I lie issues raised b\ Ihe Daily's editorial
of Oct. IS ("Corporate culture consumes
oui campus") regarding the perceived 1111-
halancc of employers who seek to hire Stan
ford graduates, while legitimate, need to be
clarified. Quite simply, many Stanford siu
dents are highly coveted In employers, both
technical and non-teclmical alike.
I nfortunately, main students and
othei members of the Stanford communi
ty, including members of the Daily Edito
rial Hoard, have developed an erroneous
pen eption that the corporate world dom
inates the locus of the Career Develop
ment Centet in assisting students with
their career support needs.
While the perception does, indeed,
exist, there is good reason lor it. Starling
with 1 lie Daily itself, the number of adver
tisements In corporate recruiters seems al
tnost overwhelming at times and some is
sues are so full of recruiting ads by invest
ment banking, management consulting
and ic( linical linns that ilic paper appears
to be a directol vof corporate Americ a.
I'nfortunately, public service, non
profit and govei nmental organizations do
not typically advertise in student newspa
pers, both because of low recruiting bud
gels and because of different recruiting
strategies than their corporate counter
parts. In short, the types, as well the vol
ume, of ads that I he I)ail\ chooses to run
onlv reinforce the perception ola "corpo
rate culture" 011 this campus.

I he CDC is very sensitive to the needs of
non-teclmical students and their career in
terests in non-profit and government orga
nizations, as well as in the media and pub
lishing industry, entertainment, etc. Last
spring, and in collaboration with the Junior
('.lass Presidents, the CDC polled all juniors
to gel feedback about employers they would
like us to "recruit " to campus for career fairs,
Cardinal Recruiting and other programs.
While only 172 juniors responded with
their employer "wish list," the CDC at
tempted to contact each and every em
plover suggested and invited them to use
any of the services of the CDC, including
career fairs, Cardinal Recruiting, full-time
and part-time job listings, internship an
nouncements, career programs and pan
els and shadowing opportunities.
The problem we encounter is that these
organizations generally do not actively re
cruit on college campuses, and their hiring
strategies are not the same as employers'
who are experiencing growth and expan
sion, or whose skill sets are difficult to find.
For this reason, the CDC has dedicated a rel
atively voluminous section of the c areer re
source center to non-profit, government
«ind public interest careers and employers.
In addition, Liberal Arts Career Week
was created to address the needs of those
students seeking c areers outside of tech
nology, investment banking and consult
ing. F.ven though il takes place during
winter quarter, the timing fits better with
the typical "recruiting" and hiring strate
gies of those organizations. We simply
can't get most of the organizations who
hire liberal arts students to come to c am
pus any earlier in the year, and those who
do come do so as a result of a great deal of
time .iiid effort invested by the CDC staff.
In an attempt to immediately accom
modate the recruiting needs of under-rep
resented employers, should they wish to
conduct on-campus interviews, the CDC
has begun reserving a percentage of the
CDC interview rooms during the peak on
campus recruiting season. Our hope is
that employers of liberal arts students who
typically hire spontaneously will be able to
obtain interview space when they need it.
Due to the small number of interview
rooms at the CDC and the unavailability
of space ac ross campus, on-campus inter
view sc hcdulcs fill nearly six months 111 ad
vance of the academic year. In fact, the
( l)( 1 cannot meet the interview schedule
requests of many employers who wish to
access Stanford students.
We are, however, endeavoring to in
sure that interview rooms are available lor
employers seeking to hire liberal arts and
other non-technical majors when they
need them. This year alone, we turned
away over 100 employers in over-repre
sented fields while saving space 101 under

represented employers.
I nfortunately, many of these "reserved"
rooms go unused because under represent
ed employers generally do not interview on
campus. In addition, because students from
under-represented programs often erro
neously perceive that we do not serve their
fields of interest, when we are able to attract
under represented employers to campus,
their schedules often go unfilled.
In addition to reserving space for
under-represented employers for Cardi
nal Recruiting, the CDC holds a percent
age of tables aside during career fairs for
employers seeking candidates for fields
other than investment banking, manage
ment consulting and high tech. The CDC
also collaborates with Ivy League schools
to sponsor a Virtual Career Fair that
specifically seeks under-represented em
ployers and career fields.
Finally, it is important to remember that
the mission of the ( IX' is not to be a "place
ment service." We exist to provide students
with the skills and the knowledge they need
to make effective career and employment
decisions. Included in the development of
career skills is helping students learn how to
network, research and approach employers
who meet their interests, skills and values.
Bv virtue of the demand by .ill employers
for specific skill sets, some students and ma
jors will be in greater demand than others.
Ihe demand lor students with technical
skills is particularly pervasive in this econo
my and in this region. The CDC is particu
larly committed to assisting students whose
majors and skills appeal to be more chal
lenging to market to prospective employers.
Students from under-represented ma
jors need to understand, however, that
while there are excellent jobs available for
them, they must be more energetic and
focused in their career research and em
ployment dibits.
As a marketing tool for CDC programs,
I lie Daily is an excellent vehicle to help
eliminate the perception ihat the CDC fa
vors the corporate world. If the editorial
stall is serious about their concerns fora
more balanced representation of employers
or greater support for non-tech students,
they should be more willing to work with the
CDC stall to write articles or provide other
means for advertising the full spectrum of
our services and career opportunities.
1 1istorit ally, it has been difficult to get the
degree of coverage that demonstrates our
commitment to all of the career interests and
options ol Stanford students. II The Daily is
willing to work with us, I believe we can
make significant improvements in address
ing the "under-represented' career inter
ests of Stanford students.

Nader criticism went too far
John (iibbs look an awkward look back
ward m Ins N<>\. K column ("Nader's (ireen
I'ari\ is so< ialism dressed in new clothes'") as
he reminded us, in .1 McC.arthvesque style,
nl the horrors of Stalin's and Mao's failed at
tempts .11 Marxist ('ommunism and tried to
map those observations onto Ralph Nader's
political agenda.
Apparently, (libbs is confused about
the actual tenets ol Marxism, its diller
ences Itolll socialism and its connections to
the (ireen Party platform. I do not defend
Stalin's atrocities, but it is incorrect and ir
responsible to extend the failure of Soviet
('.ommunism to some moral judgment
that modern socialism is "evil."
I he terms socialism and communism
are not freely interchangeable, as (iibbs
seems think. In addition, (iibbs neglects
much of the actual historical and present
adaptation ol socialist doctrine and it's suc
cess in Kit rope under the welfare state. I
wonder, does (iibbs see the economic and
social policy 111 countries such as Germany,
France and Sweden .is "morally wrong"
and "economically disastrous."
As for Ralph Nader's ideas, 1 think lie is
right to address the extremely dispropor
tionate nature ol corporate influence in gov
ernment as well .is their impart on our soci
ety. (abbs argues against government regu
lation of business in favor of market-based
control. Would he agree then that we
should remove the government subsidies
and tax breaks given to business so that we

could have a true market based system?
And what about the failure of current
ec onomic models to assign any value to nat
ural resources or externalities? In .1 perfect
market, wouldn't those costs be properly ac -
counted lor? (libbs suggests that Nader's
plank for "Ecological Wisdom" would trans
late into restrictive environmental regula
tions forc ing businesses 10 adopt expensive
and inefficient tec hnologies.
I lie opposite is proven to be true.
When corporations are laced with paying
lor their negative social and environmen
tal externalities, they suddenly find tec h
nologies and production processes that
are far more efficient and that return
enormous savings on costs such as energy.
Lastly, 1 must address Gibbs' most in
sulting insinuation that those who voted
lot Nader in the recent election had not
read his platlorm and c ast their vote out ol
apathy. Ihe apathetic do not vote. (liti
/ens that were concerned, active and
probably better informed as a group,
made a choice to support the (Ireen Party.

Grape boycott a matter of basic humanity
I am writing this letter to entourage
you to take a stand and vote against the
serving ol grapes in Stanford's dining
halls. I lie 1994 hunger strikers have given
us a significant power to choose to support
the boycott of grapes. I applaud the Uni

versity's effort in recognizing our voice.
Now is the time lor our voice to be heard.
During Ihe week of Nov. 13 to 17, the
issue is in our hands and I he outcome de
pends on our educated vote. I hat's right,
I s.iid educated. We are all at this institu
tion because we are among the brightest
in the nation, and tlu> world for that mat
ter. In light of this we have an incredible
opportunity and it is out duty to voice our
opinions.
Personally, I hold the grape boycott in
high esteem because, like many Stanford
students on campus, 1 reali/e it is not about
having the sweet fruit to eat. No. The issue
is much deeper. It is not an issue of fruit, or
unions trying to get support and money by
boycotting major growers. The issue at
hand is human rights. It could have been
any fruit or vegetable, it could have been ap
ples! But the fact is that the people aflected
are those who work in the grape fields.
Supporters of tlie grape boycott feel so
strongly about the issue because there are
thousands of real people being exploited.
Made to work from dawn till dusk, wear
ing layers of dot lung to protect themselves
from the sun, the farmworkers who pick
the grapes face a terrible threat. Besides
horrible facilities, long hours, backbreak
ing work in the hot sun and a less than
minimum wage salary, they face the car
cinogenic pesticides that permeate the air,
water and even the fruit in the fields.
What kind of decent person would
knowingly place another human being in
such conditions? I lie slave-like work envi
ronment was simply not enough lor the
growers to be happy. I lie yield on grapes
must be more. Whv risk declining costs due
to some pesky little msec is. right?
It is far easier to spend a little extra
monev on pesticides that kill these iin\ an
imals to save more of the c rop and put a
nice wad ol cash in the pocket book. \\ li\
not? I'll tell you why. Doing ibis exposes
the workers to these carcinogens and c aus
es asthma, birth defects, cancer, nose
bleeds and severe headaches amongst a
majority of the workers!
It is like a slow biological warfare on
their workforce. I lie farmworkers are in
the fields long enough lobe exposed to I he
point where serious side eflects become
blaianth apparent and then they must
leave their job. N< > harm done to the grow
ers. Simply replace them with more work
ers in the same conditions and expose
I lie-in to the same pesticides.
I ley, wli) not? Most ol the workers are
immigrants and have a fear ol being re
ported, so 11 icy surelv will not speak out
against you. Since they live in that leai the
growers can play oil ol it and give tliem
less than minimum wage, batch enough
to keep alive but well enough to keep
working. Exposing them to toxic chemi
cals is no big deal because they're blind to
the ellec tsand, when they become ill, tliey
fear going to the hospital because of the
expensive bill so the) remain cjuiet. You
surely would not inform them that they
would receive workers compensation be
cause, let's face it. profit reigns. That's the
whole reason to use pestic ides in the first
place.
So we have an endless, malicious cycle
that will not slop unless the squeeze is put
on the grape growers. 1 he larmworkers
deserve a better life than the one they are
receiving today. Kven as you read ibis
there are thousands sullering under the
conditions listed above. W ill vnu sii by and
not voice your opinion? Is the delectable
luxurious little green grape you crave
worth all ol that hurt and sullei ing of oth
ers? You decide. Be educated. Be true to
yourself. Do not be selfish. Make a small
sacrifice fora great cause.
So, Stanford, let your voice be heard
loud and dear. Show your (ompassion for
humanity and vote to boycott grapes. Now
is the time to let the grape growers know
that we will not stand lor the harsh treat
ment of our fellow human beings. I )emon
strate, through your vote, that you know
what thev are doing and you will not sup

port their inhumane policies.

Pesticides harm people and environment
I am very iouterned about the indiflerence
and hostility that Stanford students have
shown towards die issue ol the grape boycott.
Many students ignorant I v believe that the issue
does not aflect tliem because they are not di
rectlv involved. Nevertheless. Stanford siu
dents should be concerned with the (irape
Boycott issue for two reasons: Pesticides allect
us ;ill (if we are farm workers or not), and, as
members of the Stanford community, we
should support the worthwhile struggles that
concern the members of our communih.
As a biotechnology student and future
health care provider. I am very aware ol the
detrimental eflects of pesticides. Pesticides
can drift 50 or more meters from the site
they are implemented. Furthermore, the\
contaminate water, air and soil several miles
from the fields w here they are used. ()ur en
vironment , as .1 result, is irrevocably aliened
In pesticide induced bio-build up.
Along with damaging our environ
ment, pestic ides have adverse effects on
human health. For example, multiple al
lergies are inllained by the widespread use
of pesticides. Last year alone, each Ameri
can was exposed to a teaspoon (10 grams)
ol pesticides. In California a lot of those
pesticides came from grape fields, which
are prominent in Sonoma and Napa.
Moreover, the eflects of pesticides on
farm workers and people who live near farm
fields is exponential!) worse, because the)
are commonly in direct contact with pesti
cides. Birth defects, cancer, severe allergic
reactions and poisoning .ire but a lew ol the
health conditions workers display .is a result
of pesticide exposure. 1 lowever, these nega
tive environmental and health elfec is < an be
prevented at low cost.
Many ellective means ol pest control
presently exist in the I nited Stales. Biotech
nology presently oilers alternative pest < <>n
trol methods, which are environmentally
safe and have little or no incidence ol health
risk. (ieiieiicallv engineered crops, foi ex
ample, can produce their own pesticides,
which reduce the need lor multiple pesti
cide implementation, and spec ilicalh attack
the pest species of choice. Moreover, these
alternative means are much more econonii
( ally sound in the long run, which means it
is not unreasonable for us to ask that grape
growers revise their means ol pest control.
Stanford's community is one lli.it fos
ters tolerance and informed actions
among its members. Whether we support,
oppose or are neutral with respect to the
grape boycott, as tolerant and informed

individuals, we should respect others' ef
forts to promote and implement the grape
boycott.
I lie grape boycott is a universal issue
because it deals with worker's rights and,
more generally, human rights. There is
nothing beneficial about widespread pesti
cide use, except for those who make a
profit ol the side of grapes at the expense
of the environment, our health and the
larni workers' lives. H\ supporting the ban

grape growers that we are not willing to

pest control, siinplv by refusing to consume
such .1 substitutable fruit as grapes. I strong
l\ urge you to join me in the struggle for hu

cause, let's face it. profit reigns. That's the
whole reason to use pestic ides in the first
place.
So we have an endless, malicious cycle
that will not slop unless the squeeze is put
on the grape growers. 1 he larmworkers
deserve a better life than the one they are
receiving today. Kven as you read ibis
there are thousands sullering under the
conditions listed above. W ill vnu sii by and
not voice your opinion? Is the delectable
luxurious little green grape you crave
worth all ol that hurt and sullei ing of oth
ers? You decide. Be educated. Be true to
yourself. Do not be selfish. Make a small
sacrifice fora great cause.
So, Stanford, let your voice be heard
loud and dear. Show your (ompassion for
humanity and vote to boycott grapes. Now
is the time to let the grape growers know
that we will not stand lor the harsh treat
ment of our fellow human beings. I )emon
strate, through your vote, that you know
what thev are doing and you will not sup

port their inhumane policies.

Pesticides harm people and environment
I am very iouterned about the indiflerence
and hostility that Stanford students have
shown towards die issue ol the grape boycott.
Many students ignorant I v believe that the issue
does not aflect tliem because they are not di
rectlv involved. Nevertheless. Stanford siu
dents should be concerned with the (irape
Boycott issue for two reasons: Pesticides allect
us ;ill (if we are farm workers or not), and, as
members of the Stanford community, we
should support the worthwhile struggles that
concern the members of our communih.
As a biotechnology student and future
health care provider. I am very aware ol the
detrimental eflects of pesticides. Pesticides
can drift 50 or more meters from the site
they are implemented. Furthermore, the\
contaminate water, air and soil several miles
from the fields w here they are used. ()ur en
vironment , as .1 result, is irrevocably aliened
In pesticide induced bio-build up.
Along with damaging our environ
ment, pestic ides have adverse effects on
human health. For example, multiple al
lergies are inllained by the widespread use
of pesticides. Last year alone, each Ameri
can was exposed to a teaspoon (10 grams)
ol pesticides. In California a lot of those
pesticides came from grape fields, which
are prominent in Sonoma and Napa.
Moreover, the eflects of pesticides on
farm workers and people who live near farm
fields is exponential!) worse, because the)
are commonly in direct contact with pesti
cides. Birth defects, cancer, severe allergic
reactions and poisoning .ire but a lew ol the
health conditions workers display .is a result
of pesticide exposure. 1 lowever, these nega
tive environmental and health elfec is < an be
prevented at low cost.
Many ellective means ol pest control
presently exist in the I nited Stales. Biotech
nology presently oilers alternative pest < <>n
trol methods, which are environmentally
safe and have little or no incidence ol health
risk. (ieiieiicallv engineered crops, foi ex
ample, can produce their own pesticides,
which reduce the need lor multiple pesti
cide implementation, and spec ilicalh attack
the pest species of choice. Moreover, these
alternative means are much more econonii
( ally sound in the long run, which means it
is not unreasonable for us to ask that grape
growers revise their means ol pest control.
Stanford's community is one lli.it fos
ters tolerance and informed actions
among its members. Whether we support,
oppose or are neutral with respect to the
grape boycott, as tolerant and informed

individuals, we should respect others' ef
forts to promote and implement the grape
boycott.
I lie grape boycott is a universal issue
because it deals with worker's rights and,
more generally, human rights. There is
nothing beneficial about widespread pesti
cide use, except for those who make a
profit ol the side of grapes at the expense
of the environment, our health and the
larni workers' lives. H\ supporting the ban
ol grapes on campus, we make it clear to
grape growers that we are not willing to
s,k rilice our environment and our health
so that they can turn .1 profit.
Kllectively, the grape boycott will pres
sure grape growers to improve working
conditions and use alternative methods of
pest control, siinplv by refusing to consume
such .1 substitutable fruit as grapes. I strong
l\ urge you to join me in the struggle for hu
mane treatment of farm workers and the use
of alternative pest control. Support basic
human rights to "life, liberty" and the re
moval of grapes from our dining halls.

Daily misrepresents CDC efforts
I lie issues raised b\ Ihe Daily's editorial
of Oct. IS ("Corporate culture consumes
oui campus") regarding the perceived 1111-
halancc of employers who seek to hire Stan
ford graduates, while legitimate, need to be
clarified. Quite simply, many Stanford siu
dents are highly coveted In employers, both
technical and non-teclmical alike.
I nfortunately, main students and
othei members of the Stanford communi
ty, including members of the Daily Edito
rial Hoard, have developed an erroneous
pen eption that the corporate world dom
inates the locus of the Career Develop
ment Centet in assisting students with
their career support needs.
While the perception does, indeed,
exist, there is good reason lor it. Starling
with 1 lie Daily itself, the number of adver
tisements In corporate recruiters seems al
tnost overwhelming at times and some is
sues are so full of recruiting ads by invest
ment banking, management consulting
and ic( linical linns that ilic paper appears
to be a directol vof corporate Americ a.
I'nfortunately, public service, non
profit and govei nmental organizations do
not typically advertise in student newspa
pers, both because of low recruiting bud
gels and because of different recruiting
strategies than their corporate counter
parts. In short, the types, as well the vol
ume, of ads that I he I)ail\ chooses to run
onlv reinforce the perception ola "corpo
rate culture" 011 this campus.

I he CDC is very sensitive to the needs of
non-teclmical students and their career in
terests in non-profit and government orga
nizations, as well as in the media and pub
lishing industry, entertainment, etc. Last
spring, and in collaboration with the Junior
('.lass Presidents, the CDC polled all juniors
to gel feedback about employers they would
like us to "recruit " to campus for career fairs,
Cardinal Recruiting and other programs.
While only 172 juniors responded with
their employer "wish list," the CDC at
tempted to contact each and every em
plover suggested and invited them to use
any of the services of the CDC, including
career fairs, Cardinal Recruiting, full-time
and part-time job listings, internship an
nouncements, career programs and pan
els and shadowing opportunities.
The problem we encounter is that these
organizations generally do not actively re
cruit on college campuses, and their hiring
strategies are not the same as employers'
who are experiencing growth and expan
sion, or whose skill sets are difficult to find.
For this reason, the CDC has dedicated a rel
atively voluminous section of the c areer re
source center to non-profit, government
«ind public interest careers and employers.
In addition, Liberal Arts Career Week
was created to address the needs of those
students seeking c areers outside of tech
nology, investment banking and consult
ing. F.ven though il takes place during
winter quarter, the timing fits better with
the typical "recruiting" and hiring strate
gies of those organizations. We simply
can't get most of the organizations who
hire liberal arts students to come to c am
pus any earlier in the year, and those who
do come do so as a result of a great deal of
time .iiid effort invested by the CDC staff.
In an attempt to immediately accom
modate the recruiting needs of under-rep
resented employers, should they wish to
conduct on-campus interviews, the CDC
has begun reserving a percentage of the
CDC interview rooms during the peak on
campus recruiting season. Our hope is
that employers of liberal arts students who
typically hire spontaneously will be able to
obtain interview space when they need it.
Due to the small number of interview
rooms at the CDC and the unavailability
of space ac ross campus, on-campus inter
view sc hcdulcs fill nearly six months 111 ad
vance of the academic year. In fact, the
( l)( 1 cannot meet the interview schedule
requests of many employers who wish to
access Stanford students.
We are, however, endeavoring to in
sure that interview rooms are available lor
employers seeking to hire liberal arts and
other non-technical majors when they
need them. This year alone, we turned
away over 100 employers in over-repre
sented fields while saving space 101 under

represented employers.
I nfortunately, many of these "reserved"
rooms go unused because under represent
ed employers generally do not interview on
campus. In addition, because students from
under-represented programs often erro
neously perceive that we do not serve their
fields of interest, when we are able to attract
under represented employers to campus,
their schedules often go unfilled.
In addition to reserving space for
under-represented employers for Cardi
nal Recruiting, the CDC holds a percent
age of tables aside during career fairs for
employers seeking candidates for fields
other than investment banking, manage
ment consulting and high tech. The CDC
also collaborates with Ivy League schools
to sponsor a Virtual Career Fair that
specifically seeks under-represented em
ployers and career fields.
Finally, it is important to remember that
the mission of the ( IX' is not to be a "place
ment service." We exist to provide students
with the skills and the knowledge they need
to make effective career and employment
decisions. Included in the development of
career skills is helping students learn how to
network, research and approach employers
who meet their interests, skills and values.
Bv virtue of the demand by .ill employers
for specific skill sets, some students and ma
jors will be in greater demand than others.
Ihe demand lor students with technical
skills is particularly pervasive in this econo
my and in this region. The CDC is particu
larly committed to assisting students whose
majors and skills appeal to be more chal
lenging to market to prospective employers.
Students from under-represented ma
jors need to understand, however, that
while there are excellent jobs available for
them, they must be more energetic and
focused in their career research and em
ployment dibits.
As a marketing tool for CDC programs,
I lie Daily is an excellent vehicle to help
eliminate the perception ihat the CDC fa
vors the corporate world. If the editorial
stall is serious about their concerns fora
more balanced representation of employers
or greater support for non-tech students,
they should be more willing to work with the
CDC stall to write articles or provide other
means for advertising the full spectrum of
our services and career opportunities.
1 1istorit ally, it has been difficult to get the
degree of coverage that demonstrates our
commitment to all of the career interests and
options ol Stanford students. II The Daily is
willing to work with us, I believe we can
make significant improvements in address
ing the "under-represented' career inter
ests of Stanford students.
