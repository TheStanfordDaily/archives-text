Nader criticism went too far
John (iibbs look an awkward look back
ward m Ins N<>\. K column ("Nader's (ireen
I'ari\ is so< ialism dressed in new clothes'") as
he reminded us, in .1 McC.arthvesque style,
nl the horrors of Stalin's and Mao's failed at
tempts .11 Marxist ('ommunism and tried to
map those observations onto Ralph Nader's
political agenda.
Apparently, (libbs is confused about
the actual tenets ol Marxism, its diller
ences Itolll socialism and its connections to
the (ireen Party platform. I do not defend
Stalin's atrocities, but it is incorrect and ir
responsible to extend the failure of Soviet
('.ommunism to some moral judgment
that modern socialism is "evil."
I he terms socialism and communism
are not freely interchangeable, as (iibbs
seems think. In addition, (iibbs neglects
much of the actual historical and present
adaptation ol socialist doctrine and it's suc
cess in Kit rope under the welfare state. I
wonder, does (iibbs see the economic and
social policy 111 countries such as Germany,
France and Sweden .is "morally wrong"
and "economically disastrous."
As for Ralph Nader's ideas, 1 think lie is
right to address the extremely dispropor
tionate nature ol corporate influence in gov
ernment as well .is their impart on our soci
ety. (abbs argues against government regu
lation of business in favor of market-based
control. Would he agree then that we
should remove the government subsidies
and tax breaks given to business so that we

could have a true market based system?
And what about the failure of current
ec onomic models to assign any value to nat
ural resources or externalities? In .1 perfect
market, wouldn't those costs be properly ac -
counted lor? (libbs suggests that Nader's
plank for "Ecological Wisdom" would trans
late into restrictive environmental regula
tions forc ing businesses 10 adopt expensive
and inefficient tec hnologies.
I lie opposite is proven to be true.
When corporations are laced with paying
lor their negative social and environmen
tal externalities, they suddenly find tec h
nologies and production processes that
are far more efficient and that return
enormous savings on costs such as energy.
Lastly, 1 must address Gibbs' most in
sulting insinuation that those who voted
lot Nader in the recent election had not
read his platlorm and c ast their vote out ol
apathy. Ihe apathetic do not vote. (liti
/ens that were concerned, active and
probably better informed as a group,
made a choice to support the (Ireen Party.

Grape boycott a matter of basic humanity
I am writing this letter to entourage
you to take a stand and vote against the
serving ol grapes in Stanford's dining
halls. I lie 1994 hunger strikers have given
us a significant power to choose to support
the boycott of grapes. I applaud the Uni

versity's effort in recognizing our voice.
Now is the time lor our voice to be heard.
During Ihe week of Nov. 13 to 17, the
issue is in our hands and I he outcome de
pends on our educated vote. I hat's right,
I s.iid educated. We are all at this institu
tion because we are among the brightest
in the nation, and tlu> world for that mat
ter. In light of this we have an incredible
opportunity and it is out duty to voice our
opinions.
Personally, I hold the grape boycott in
high esteem because, like many Stanford
students on campus, 1 reali/e it is not about
having the sweet fruit to eat. No. The issue
is much deeper. It is not an issue of fruit, or
unions trying to get support and money by
boycotting major growers. The issue at
hand is human rights. It could have been
any fruit or vegetable, it could have been ap
ples! But the fact is that the people aflected
are those who work in the grape fields.
Supporters of tlie grape boycott feel so
strongly about the issue because there are
thousands of real people being exploited.
Made to work from dawn till dusk, wear
ing layers of dot lung to protect themselves
from the sun, the farmworkers who pick
the grapes face a terrible threat. Besides
horrible facilities, long hours, backbreak
ing work in the hot sun and a less than
minimum wage salary, they face the car
cinogenic pesticides that permeate the air,
water and even the fruit in the fields.
What kind of decent person would
knowingly place another human being in
