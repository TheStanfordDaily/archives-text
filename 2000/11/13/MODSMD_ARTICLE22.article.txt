# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Feel good getting rich; greed is the highest moral virtue 
### JASON RHEINS GUEST COLUMNIST 
Whether it is Ralph Nader's
speech chastising you lor
your "golden hand-culls,"
the editors ol 1 lie Stanford
Daily decrying the lack ol 'non-profit orga
nizations at the Career Fair, Setli Newton
urging you to break the Stanford huhhle
or Daniel Kemper Donavan complaining
about the political apathy ol prolcssional
track students, one message is aimed at
Stanford students day after day: "Corpo
rate culture consumes our campus" (from
the Kditorial Board of I he Stanford
I )ailv).
We students, who have toiled to make it

to the Farm and who now toil to eat n a life
of wealth and rewards, get reminded con
stantly that the opportunities we will have
alter graduating from Stanford are a priv
ilege, implying a "gift as opposed to that
which we have rightfully earned.
Stanlbrd students who want to earn
their Ibrtunes are led to believe that their
interests are materialistic, base and inferi
or to the "higher ideals" of self-sacrifice
through community service or leftist polit
ical activism.
1 would like to say something on be
half Of every student who is passionate
ly, selfishly devoted to the ideal of
achieving excellence in their chosen
field. In particular, I would like to speak
on behalf of the let hies who may hope

to someday strike it big in Silicon Valley
or on Wall Street.
You may be decried as apathetic, taunt
ed as "yuppies" and sniggered at as "capi
talist pigs" by those around you, but one
overlooked filet holds true throughout
this assault: You are virtuous.
You have chosen to use your minds to
produce values. You deserve not only all
the profit that you will create, but the high
est moral praise. While the new-New Left
screams and protests that they must save
the world from corporate greed as they all
but beg for the destruction of the compa
nies that create life-giving technology, you
are learning to construct, design and pro
gram. And, one day, after leaving Stan
lbrd, you will apply that knowledge to cre

ate real, concrete values.
You build up, and they tear down. It is
you, the producers of wealth, that occupy
the moral high ground, and it is time that
you know it.
Stanford, for all of its connections to Sil
icon Valley, is not corporate enough, if by
corporate one implies a focus on produc -
tion for the sake of personal profit. Fvery
day this university's students, the nation's
best and brightest, learn that on ac count of
their abilities, they have a duty to pay back
everyone who has worked less diligenth
or is less competent than they.
We are oflered sacrifice as the standard
of ethics. Instead, students, both tec hie
and fu/zie, should learn ili.tt to earn val
ues and happiness for oneself is the moral

ideal. Never should you have to feel even
a twinge of guilt when you are denounced
lor your greed.
ll'you believe you have a right to your
own happiness and that your life is justi
fied not In service toothers, but your pur
suit of values, then you owe it to yourself to
learn the philosophical justification for
your rare virtue.
You have heard from the opponents of
selfishness throughout most of your life
and throughout all your time at Stanford.
Is it not it time to hear and consider the al
ternative, if only this once?
