# Librarian wants to create archive for Y10K
## Initiative will preserve information for 10,000 years 
### NIKI WILSON 
Stanford's head librarian, Michael Keller,
likes planning ahead. Id fact, he's planning so far
ahead thai he lias recent 1\ begun a project to
preserve libran information for the next 10,000
years.
Keller will serve as the co-chair in developing
a large national arc hiving project known .is the
"10,000-Yeai Librarv Initiative." I he project is
sponsored In the Long Now Foundation, an or
ganization dedicated to the long-term preserva
tion of information.
I he initiative has been under serious consid
eration since <111 international conference on
campus last |une. 1 he goal is to preserve toda\ s
collective information for another 10,000
vears — long enough to survive massive cultural
and environmental changes.
I he librat \ would not necessarilv be a phvsi
cal entitv: instead, it might c < >iisisi of various new

technologies that can preserve knowledge and
writings through the years.
I he technological possibilities include the de
velopment of (!D-R( )Ms with 10,000-year shelf
lives, the transporting of archives to the moon
and the microscopic metal etching technique,
that could inscribe the Old Testament in every
language onto grains of silicon.
Working with Green Library's spec ial collec
tions, the initiative strives to develop a more eter
nal arc hiving system.
Despite the vagueness of the early stages of
development, this metaphorical institution
should eventually lit Keller's definition of "li
braries [that document] many events over long
amounts of time."
I he library is intended to stretch the minds
and imagination of archivists as they brainstorm
ways to keep information intact through several
hundred generations.
"We're trying to propagate the notion that we
need to think [on a larger time scalej than we do
now," Keller stressed.
Ac cording to the Long Now Foundation Web
site, "the digital industries must shift from being
the main source of society's ever-shortening at

tention span to becoming a reliable guarantor of
long-term perspective."
Attending the June conference were profes
sionals ranging 112 rom an anthropologist to a rep
resentative from the U.S. Department of Energy
to a Vatican librarian.
The conference introduced the Rosetta Disk,
which, unlike digital forms of stored information
that can be lost by changes in operating systems,
uses analog format.
The disk is made from nickel and inscribed
with the first three chapters of Genesis from the
Bible.
Such projects should spawn other projects in
the quest for everlasting archiving, according to
Keller.
Eventually, he said, students may become in
volved with the library, helping develop it in
stead of merely taking advantage of it as re
searchers and readers.
Keller, whose other positions include director
of Academic Information, publisher of High
Wire Press and publisher of the Stanford L'ni
versity Press, considers librarians the "cultural
custodians" that help secure today's information
for tomorrow's scholars.
