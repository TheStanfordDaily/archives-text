# Dorm classes are a chance for new learning, exploring
## 
### NICHOLAS CHAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Most Stanford (lasses require class attendance,
outside reading and additional labs or sections. But
several courses offered in certain dormitories explore
in detail the topic of ethnic or academic theme hous
es 01 teach a basic skill such as web design.
Since many one to two unit dorm-based classes
have student instructors who are also residence stall,
both students and teachers benefit from the learning
experience.
" 1 licv [the students] know their teacher, so they
feel comfortable asking questions in the middle of the
lecture," said loin Whitnah, a residential computer
coordinator in Freshman-Sophomore College.
Staff say they enjoy teaching students who are gen
uinely interested in the subject matter. They also
think that students feel more comfortable working
with fellow students.
"Our ( lass environment seems to be less formal
than sitting in an actual classroom," said juniorjoel
Sangria, an ethnic theme assistant in Okada House,
the Asian-American theme dormitory.
Most dorms with freshmen oiler a one-unit class en
titled (Computer Science 1C: 1 ntroduc tion to Comput
ing at Stanford, which is taught In the dorm R( X is.
Through this class, which usually meets once a
week, students learn about computing basics such as
how to use word processors, spreadsheets and tools
such as scanners. They also learn about other
computer resources all over campus.
For Whitnah, teaching the class is a way to help stu
dents. but also to share his interest in computers.
"I taught the class as a requirement of being an
R( XI in a dorm with freshmen," said Whitnah, "but 1
looked forward to teaching the class because I really
enjoyed sharing my passion for some of the programs
that we made a part of the curriculum."
Ethnic theme houses, such as FAST Mouse, the
East Asian studies theme house, are another great
source for small, dorm-based classes.
Senior Leslie Ikemoto, an ETA in FAS I Mouse,
likes teaching because she feels that it benefits the
students as well as the teachers.
"I think it's really important to spread that knowl
edge throughout Stanford; it makes fora richer cul
tural life here," she said.
I he subjects covered in the FAST house seminar,
The Arts of Asia, consist of different art forms such as
mukimono, the art ol Japanese food garnishes,
Japanese llower arrangements and Bonsai tree grow
ing. I lie c urriculum depends on the interests ol the
FT As, the Resident Fellow's area of studv and other

cultural ac tivities m the area.
At Okada Mouse, Sangria is teaching a two-unit
(l.iss entitled Asian American Youth: Identity and
('.ult lire.
"(lontemporary urban youth culture has always in
terested me, so I decided to teach a ( lass on it," San
gria said.
Prior to teaching his course, Sangria took Asian-
American studies classes at Stanford and spent part ol
spring and summer quarters doing research. Sangria
did most of his research by reading different articles,
including an issue of the Amerasia Journal which was
dedicated to second-generation Asian Americans.
"This [class] is part of a project as an FFA at
()kada," Sangria said. "People seem to be interested in
topics not normally lound in a regular c lassroom set
ting."
Sangria said it is easier for students to lit two-unit
ethnic studies classes into their schedule than five
unit classes.
Sangria's course covers topics such .is higher edu
cation, hip-hop, sexuality and politics as well as the in
fluence they have on Asian-American youth.
Freshman Sarah lane Doty, a student in ('.SIC.
feels that the class is >ne of her most helpful (lasses.
"It's easier for students to teach the class because
we were brought up in the technology age and most
of our teachers weren't," Doty said. Doty said she
took the class because she was "computer illiterate."
For Doty, the sole drawback to the class is the
schedule.
"I disliked meeting only once a week for an hour,"
she said.
1 lowever, because the residential computer coor
dinators live in the dot ins, they are accessible outside
of class.
Several other courses are offered through
dormitories but are taught by Stanlorcl faculty instead
of students. ()ne sue h course, the flaw of Averages, is
part of the Management Science and Engineering
Department. Ihe three-unit course is ollered at
FroSo('.o and is almost entirely composed ol students
from the college.
Sophomore Neil Achtman took the course last
year.
"It was a great class about how to avoid statistical
fallacies," he said.
Achtman said the (lass held several advantages
such as its small size and location.
Eric Rosenberg, a freshman taking the course this
year, also enjoys the class.
"It's kind ol nice to have an interactive ( hiss where
you can bring your laptop and do the simulation
along with the professor," Rosenberg said.
