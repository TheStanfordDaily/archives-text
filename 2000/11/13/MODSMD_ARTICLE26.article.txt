## Carter, defense propel Card to win over ASU 
### MATT LONG STAFF WRITER 
hi the Stanford football team's final home game of
the year, an unexpectedly strong defensive effort,
combined with impressive running In sophomore
tailback Kerry darter, powered the Cardinal to a 29-
7 victory.
Stanford (4-6, 3-4 Pacific 10 Conference) put out
the Sun Devils' (5-5, 2-5) offensive fire by holding the
Pac-10's No. 1 passing game to just 151 yards, while
also allowing just 23 yards rushing on 34 carries.
Carter led the offense with a 19-carry, 103-yard
day to go with a rushing touchdown and a 20-yard
touchdown pass to sophomore Ryan Wells off a hall
back option play.
"It feels great [to have a blowout]," said Stanford
coach Tyrone Willingham. " Those close ones wear on
you a bit. It was nice to have a bigger win, because you
get a chance to involve the whole team."
Stanford has had plenty of close ones—its last
three games have hinged on two or three points —
two of which the Cardinal has lost.
But the (lardinal's record < annot compare to Ari
zona State's heart wrenching streak of three consecu
tive overtime games, including two double overtime
losses. The extra hours on the field took an obvious
toll as the weary Sun Devils appeared hapless offen
sively and closed out the game with theii fourth
string quarterback and third-string tailback on the
field.
"We've had nine straight weeks of football without
a bye," said head coach Bruce Snyder. "And you put
in two double-overtimes and a single overtime. Our
team looked heavy-legged. I he spirit of a team that's
fresh just wasn't there."

eligible with their sixih win, had alread\ lost starting
