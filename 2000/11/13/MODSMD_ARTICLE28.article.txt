FRESNO — The Western Regional Cross
Country Championship race was not sup
posed to be a rousing spectacle. Saturday's
meet in Fresno was to be a mere formality f ( >r
the No. 2 (Cardinal men, with a top-two finish
all but guaranteed — meaning an automatic
bid to the Nov. 20 NCAA meet in Ames, lowa.
But you'd be hard-pressed to find a rate in
which Stanford ran for second place. And even
though No. 10 Arizona tried to steal this week
end's race from the Cardinal, senior Jonat lion
Riley'sconie-froin-bchind win led the team toa
58-62 victory over the Wildcats and the 21
other contending teams.
"(The team victory] doesn't mean much,''
head coach Vin 1-manna insisted." It's like run
ning a qualifying heat — you just want to make
sure you advance out of the region.
"()ur goal is to run well at nationals, not to
win the Regional meet."
But when five Arizona runners blazed to the
lead in the first mile, ceding the victory was the
furthest thing from the Cardinal harriers
minds. After the Wildcat group spread out the
lead pack over the first two miles, Riley, senior
Thomas Murlcy and redshirt freshman l/>uis
Luchini got to playing catch-up.

"Arizona got out aggressively, which was a
pretty good strategy for them," Riley said. "If
the) want to win, that's how they have to do it.
"1 was trying not to panic," Murley said.
"When something like th.it happens, you just
have to slick lo your race plan. len kilometers
is a long ways to race, and we knew they would
come back to us."
Over the third mile, the Stanford trio
managed to reel in the Wildcats' top Five.
Riley and Oregon's |ason llartmann and
Michael Kasahun immediately set to work
pushing the pate, trying to grind the legs
out from under the Arizona runners,
while Murley and Luchini kept in touch
10 meters behind.
With a mile to go, Riley was clearly in con
trol. I Ic blasted the final mile and cruised in for
the win in 30 minutes, 40 seconds — his third
win in just four rat es this year. Murley and Lu
chini followed at seventh and eighth.
But farther back, Stanford was experiencing
difficulty. The remaining Cardinal runners,
who had fallen off the early pace, were strug
gling to catcli up to Arizona's scorers.
Sophomore Seth 112 lejny, mired back in 20th
position, had his work cut out lor him.
"I passed one Arizona guy with a mile and
a half to go, but people along the course kept
shouting to me thai I had to pass two more of

them," I lejny said. " I hen, with 150 meters to
go, 1 caught sight of those two, and I caught
them just bclore the finish."
I lejny worked his way to 1 3th-place , more
than accounting lot the lour-point margin of
victory. And even though Arizona's fifth man
finished before Stanford's fifth — freshman
lan Dobson— the 29th-place showing by
Dobsoti was enough to seal the victory. Ari
zona's bold tactics had nearly earned them
the victory, but it was Stanford's composure
that paid oil in the end.
"Whenever you're the favorite, you have to
run under control," Lananna said. "Since we
only have 1(1 days before the national meet, I
don't like our guys to get banged up."
lananna was even more careful with fresh
man Don Sage and rcdshirt frosh (Irani Robi
son, both of whom sat out Saturday's race. Ki
thcr could replace redshirl sophomores
Daniel Parris or Jesse Thomas, whose 52nd
and Olst-place finishes Saturday at 32:22 and
32:33, respectively, leave them as question
marks to be filled in before next Monday's
NCAA meet.
"We have young teams, and since we race
so infrequently, it's tough to solidify our line
up early in the season," Lananna said. "We'll
have a good sense of what we need to do by
this Tuesday."
