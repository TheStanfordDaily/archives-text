# Volleyball overcomes rough day to top Cal
## Tom leads way with 16 kills, 11 digs; Conrad has big game at middle blocker 
### EZRA CALLAHAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I leading into last Friday's match with
California, tlie volleyball gods seemed to
have aligned their collective forces against
the Stanford women's team.
Sophomore outside hitter Logan Tom
was lighting a stomach bug, senior middle
blocker Jennifer Detmer was sidelined by
sore knees, a nightmare of a traffic jam on
the way up to the East Bay left the team
with little time to warm up and the Recre
ational Sports Facility at Berkeley was
filled with a standing-room only crowd of
hostile Cal fans.
But the greatest efforts of the volleyball
deities were no match for the No. 20 Car
dinal (15-11, N-8 Pacific 10 Conference),
who trounced the Golden Bears (10-14,5-
11) 3-0 in less than 90 minutes.
"We finally played a match like we
practiced," said interim head coach
Denise Corlett. "VVe played with enthusi
asm, we played strong defense, and we got
a lot of hard spikes. It was certainly one of
our better matches of the season."
Tom overcame her health problems to
lead the Cardinal with a match-high 10
kills and 1 1 digs.
"I was a little queasy and a little nau
seous during the game," Tom said. "1
hadn't really eaten fora couple of days,
but you do what you have to do to get by."
With Detmer out of the lineup, junior
l ata Conrad moved back to the middle
blocker position where she played hist sea
sou. Conrad, who had shifted to the out
side hitter spot earlier this year (to lill the
gap left while l om was playing at the Syd
ney Olympics), posted 12 kills and a
match-high live blocks.
"I told the coaches that 1 just wanted to
be where the team needed me to be," (loli
ra d said. "()ur middle has been weaker in
the hist couple ol games, so it really helped

that [freshman middle blocker] Sara
McGee and 1 got going early. I'm glad I
played well because I'd felt a little rusty in
practice."
The Stanford squad only got about half
of its usual warm-up time before the
match after the team's bus got caught in a
two-hour long traffic jam on its way to
Berkeley.
Despite its short warm-up ,the Cardi
nal looked red-hot in the first game, jump
ing out to a 4-0 lead. Stanford dominated
the rest of the game, running off the final
eight points to take a lopsided 15-2 win
whileouthittingCal .519 to. 154 in the first
game.
Cal took an early 3-0 lead to start game
two. but the Cardinal bounced back to
even the match at 3-3. Stanford then
outscored the Bears 12-3 to win the sec
ond game 15-6.
The Bears managed to hang with the
Cardinal for much of the third game,
pulling even with Stanford at 8-8. Conrad
tallied three big kills, as Stanford ran off
the final seven points of the game to close
out the match with a 15-8 victory.
The Cardinal hit an impressive .384 for
the match while holding the Bears to a
.100 attack percentage. Stanford posted
51 kills to Cal's 30 and also outblocked Cal
9-2.
The Bears were led by outside hitter
Gabrielle Abernathy with 10 kills, while
Alicia Perry had a match-high 14 digs.
Stanford got a surprisingly strong per
formance from junior outside hitter Sara
Sandrik, who tallied four kills, two blocks
and one of the Cardinal's four service aces.
Sandrik, who started the season strong,
had not seen the court much since C ionrad
was moved to the outside.
"I think that Sandrik looked very confi
dent tonight," Corlett said. "With Tara
back in the middle, it opens some playing
time for her which she needs. She's been
practicing very well and we hope she can
keep it up."
The Cardinal returns home this week
to close out its Pat-10 schedule with
matches against the Oregon schools on
Thursday and Friday at Maples Pavilion.
