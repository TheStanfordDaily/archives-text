Inside linebacker Wire once again
made sure that no one second-guessed bis

ilic ball. I le led the defense with 10 tack

Wire's speed was most evident on a
corner blit/ late in the first quarter when
he blindsidcd Krohn for the second
lime of the game, preventing the Sun
Devils from t apilali/ing on detent field

Defensive tackle Willie Howard and
outside linebacker Riall |ohnson turned
in solid performances as well. I hrec of
