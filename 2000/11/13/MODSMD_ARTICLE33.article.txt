Junior Anna West is leading the trip
with the help of Borderlinks.
Last year, West took a similar trip to
Salinas to learn about the agricultural

I li.it excursion was one ol the reasons that
she < hose this year's trip.
"I'm interested in immigration and

border issues," West said.
Although this trip is offered during
spring break, West emphasizes that it is
not in competition with the Alternative
Spring Break program.
Borderlinks has its roots in the Sanctu
ary Movement, an interiailh group that
smuggled refugees across the border dur
ing the l ( .)H()s.
I he I nited Campus Christian Min
istry will sponsor the trip, and although
the ministry is religious, the trek will be
non-denominational.
"| I he Minist r\ is J very liberal and non
evangelical," West said.
|im Burklo, ((Hinder of East Palo Alto
I i han Ministrv, agreed.

"This trip is open to all students, re
gardless of their religious or non-religious
backgrounds," Burklo said. I lis main job
is to advise West as site plans for the trip.
lie said the trip will involve visits to
churches, but only to examine how the
church is involved in border issues.
Burklo has been involved with social
justice movements, especially those in
volving Mexico, for quite some time.
"My trips to Mexico had a big influence
on my career commitments, as a minister
fo( usingon social justice questions," Burk
lo said.
Burklo grew up near the border and
worked with his church at a school in Ti
juana and an orphanage in Ensenada. I le

studied Spanish and learned about social
and political issues while slaying in Mexi
co.
He is especially interested in the town
of Aguilila, Michoacan, Mexico because it
is the hometown of many of immigrants to
East Palo Alto.
Depending on interest, an application
form for the trip may be necessary.
Participants will enroll in a one-unit
readingand discussion course during w in
ter quarter to prepare them lor the trip.
