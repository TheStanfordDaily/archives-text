Officials from the Medical (Center
«md ilie I niversity havec reated a |)iil)li(
panel to investigate the wav both institu
tions handled allegations <>1 scieinili<
and clinical niiscondnci against three
gynecological surgeons last spring.
1 lie panel's mission — to examine
and scrutinize-.the Medical Center's
quality review and credentialing process
— reflects allegations by critics that the
university lias poorly conducted inves
tigations of the surgeons and attempted
to suppress complaints against tlieni.
brothers Caiman, Fan and Ceana
Ne/liat joined the Stanford Hospital in
1993 and have fat ed numerous allega
tions of misconduct, including a suit
filed against them in Georgia in 1993.
In a statement released In Ins lawyers
on Nov. 3. (lam ran Nezliat cited Ins ap
preciation and gratitude at the forma
tion of the public panel. I le denounced

the allegations, made in what he de
scribed as a "smear campaign."
"We look forward to clearing our
name," he said.
These allegations included claims
that the doctors performed surgeries
outside their area of expertise, attempt
ed to conceal mistakes and filed false
reports.
Ihe Ne/liats lawyers have consis
tently denied that the brothers mishan
dled cases that involved complex surgi
cal procedures in the uterine area.
However, Fart Ne/liat recently sub
mitted an affidavit in which he admitted
to making substantial errors in a med
ical report, according to MSNIU'..com.
According to Dr. Peter Gregory, the
senior associate dean of clinical affairs at
the Medical School and the chief med
ical officer of the hospital, a I niversit)
committee and the Medical ('.enter have
investigated each allegation on a case
by-case basis.

Ten of llie ,dictations have con
cerned academic conduct and nine have
involved clinical work. In 1S out of 19
cases, Gregory said, ihe panels have
(bund the allegations to be false. ()ne al
legation remains to be investigated.
The brothers also run the Stanford
Endoscopy Center for framing and
Technology.
1 he trio has been described as pio
neers m I lie lield ol lapi oscopic swrgen,
a non-intrusive technique that inserts
tiifv instruments info the body through
small incisions. Laproscopic surgerv has
allowed tremendous advances in the
treatment of endometriosis, a uterine
disease.
Before the creation of the public
panel, the allegations against the
Nezhats were investigated through two
channels.
Hospital investigations were con-
ducted through an ad hot fact
finding committee concerned
with the delivery of clinical care.
The I Jniversity appointed a com
mittee lot the academic inquiry ol
allegations ol poor scholarship
and scientific misconduct.
Both these committees
continue to exist. The recently ap
pointed public panel, however,
lias been created through a joint
ellort between the hospital and
the University.
Hospital and University offi
cials hope that the new public
panel will acknowledge and inte
grate the investigative efforts of
both institutions.
"We expect ih.tt they will make
a report that will reflect their pub
lit trust both to the University and
it) the hospital," (iregory said.
According it) (iregory, the
panel will be free to review any
material that it chooses.
Although the panel will work
in cooperation with the hospital
and the University, (iregory in
tends its deliberation and critique
to ultimately be independent ol
either institution.
"We have felt that the allega
tions coming forward need it) be
met bv unassailable, independent
assessment of the way we insure
the public trust," he said.
1 he three-member indepen
dent panel, titled the Panel on

Academic and Critical Integrity,
includes Mitchell Rabkin, Kric
Loewy and Kdward Panelli.
Rabkin is a former CEO of
Boston's Belli Israel Hospital and
a professor at Harvard Medical
School. Loewy is the alumni chair
of the Bioethics Department at
I ( .-Davis Medical Center.
Loewy lias expanded Davis's
offerings in bioethics to include a
strong ethical component in the
medical school curriculum.
Panelli is a retired California
Supreme (iourt judge.
(iregory stated tli.u the panel
was designed to reflect a variety ol
viewpoints as well as distinguished
medical and ethical service.
"They all three have extraordi
nary integrity, they bring to it a
variety of points of view, a variety
of stances, and we thought that
the balance and variety would re
flect the public, and that's what
we're really after; we want a pub
lic judgment," he said.
Mark Spirtos, a clinical associ
ate professor at the Medical
School and one of the most out
spoken detractors ol the Ne/liat
brothers has not been asked to
speak before the panel. Spirtos
will instead report to the ad hoc
committee.
Spirtos claims that the investi
gation process's multi-layered na
ture constitutes a "shell game."
1 le also claims that the distinc
tion between the hospital's fact
finding committee and the Uni
versity's committee <>1 academic
inquiry is not being upheld.

"Kvidence of scientific miscon
duct should he submitted to the
University, not the hospital,"
Spirtos said.
I le cites evidence, especially a
recent MSNBC, article that claims
that the Nezhats have admitted to
substantial discrepancies in their
medical reports.
According to MSNBC, the er
rors in the report were too exten
sive to have been mistakes, includ
ing discrepancies in the ages of
the patients.
"The Nezhats have already ad
mitted to writing fabricated jour
nal articles," lie said.
"In ili.it context, 1 find it amaz
ing thai a prestigious university
such as Stanford, and more specif
ically, Stanford Hospital, has not
taken any interim provisions while
this quote investigation is taking
place."
Dr. Gregory responded to
Spirtos's allegations by stating
thai Stanford would consider the
Nezhat brothers innocent until
proven guilty.
"Allegations remain allegations
until they are proven to be true. II
proven to be true, we would act on
them, and we have acted in the
past," lie said.
Allan Mayer, spokesman for the
Nezhat brothers, commended the
Medical ( enter and the I niversity
for their treatment of the case.
"Stanford Medical Center has
been amazingly supportive of the
Nezhats," he said. "The Nezhats
have great trust in the integrity of
the institution."

Spirtos said.
I le cites evidence, especially a
recent MSNBC, article that claims
that the Nezhats have admitted to
substantial discrepancies in their
medical reports.
According to MSNBC, the er
rors in the report were too exten
sive to have been mistakes, includ
ing discrepancies in the ages of
the patients.
"The Nezhats have already ad
mitted to writing fabricated jour
nal articles," lie said.
"In ili.it context, 1 find it amaz
ing thai a prestigious university
such as Stanford, and more specif
ically, Stanford Hospital, has not
taken any interim provisions while

place."
Dr. Gregory responded to
Spirtos's allegations by stating
thai Stanford would consider the
Nezhat brothers innocent until
proven guilty.
"Allegations remain allegations

proven to be true, we would act on
them, and we have acted in the
past," lie said.
Allan Mayer, spokesman for the
Nezhat brothers, commended the

for their treatment of the case.
"Stanford Medical Center has

the institution."
Officials from the Medical (Center

panel to investigate the wav both institu

and clinical niiscondnci against three

— reflects allegations by critics that the

to suppress complaints against tlieni.
brothers Caiman, Fan and Ceana
Ne/liat joined the Stanford Hospital in
1993 and have fat ed numerous allega
tions of misconduct, including a suit
filed against them in Georgia in 1993.
In a statement released In Ins lawyers
on Nov. 3. (lam ran Nezliat cited Ins ap
preciation and gratitude at the forma
tion of the public panel. I le denounced

the allegations, made in what he de
scribed as a "smear campaign."
"We look forward to clearing our
name," he said.
These allegations included claims
that the doctors performed surgeries
outside their area of expertise, attempt
ed to conceal mistakes and filed false
reports.
Ihe Ne/liats lawyers have consis
tently denied that the brothers mishan
dled cases that involved complex surgi
cal procedures in the uterine area.
However, Fart Ne/liat recently sub
mitted an affidavit in which he admitted
to making substantial errors in a med
ical report, according to MSNIU'..com.
According to Dr. Peter Gregory, the
senior associate dean of clinical affairs at
the Medical School and the chief med
ical officer of the hospital, a I niversit)
committee and the Medical ('.enter have
investigated each allegation on a case
by-case basis.

Ten of llie ,dictations have con
cerned academic conduct and nine have
involved clinical work. In 1S out of 19
cases, Gregory said, ihe panels have
(bund the allegations to be false. ()ne al
legation remains to be investigated.
The brothers also run the Stanford
Endoscopy Center for framing and
Technology.
1 he trio has been described as pio
neers m I lie lield ol lapi oscopic swrgen,
a non-intrusive technique that inserts
tiifv instruments info the body through
small incisions. Laproscopic surgerv has
allowed tremendous advances in the
treatment of endometriosis, a uterine
disease.
Before the creation of the public
panel, the allegations against the
Nezhats were investigated through two
channels.
Hospital investigations were con-
ducted through an ad hot fact
finding committee concerned
with the delivery of clinical care.
The I Jniversity appointed a com
mittee lot the academic inquiry ol
allegations ol poor scholarship
and scientific misconduct.
Both these committees
continue to exist. The recently ap
pointed public panel, however,
lias been created through a joint
ellort between the hospital and
the University.
Hospital and University offi
cials hope that the new public
panel will acknowledge and inte
grate the investigative efforts of
both institutions.
"We expect ih.tt they will make
a report that will reflect their pub
lit trust both to the University and
it) the hospital," (iregory said.
According it) (iregory, the
panel will be free to review any
material that it chooses.
Although the panel will work
in cooperation with the hospital
and the University, (iregory in
tends its deliberation and critique
to ultimately be independent ol
either institution.
"We have felt that the allega
tions coming forward need it) be
met bv unassailable, independent
assessment of the way we insure
the public trust," he said.
1 he three-member indepen
dent panel, titled the Panel on

Academic and Critical Integrity,
includes Mitchell Rabkin, Kric
Loewy and Kdward Panelli.
Rabkin is a former CEO of
Boston's Belli Israel Hospital and
a professor at Harvard Medical
School. Loewy is the alumni chair
of the Bioethics Department at
I ( .-Davis Medical Center.
Loewy lias expanded Davis's
offerings in bioethics to include a
strong ethical component in the
medical school curriculum.
Panelli is a retired California
Supreme (iourt judge.
(iregory stated tli.u the panel
was designed to reflect a variety ol
viewpoints as well as distinguished
medical and ethical service.
"They all three have extraordi
nary integrity, they bring to it a
variety of points of view, a variety
of stances, and we thought that
the balance and variety would re
flect the public, and that's what
we're really after; we want a pub
lic judgment," he said.
Mark Spirtos, a clinical associ
ate professor at the Medical
School and one of the most out
spoken detractors ol the Ne/liat
brothers has not been asked to
speak before the panel. Spirtos
will instead report to the ad hoc
committee.
Spirtos claims that the investi
gation process's multi-layered na
ture constitutes a "shell game."
1 le also claims that the distinc
tion between the hospital's fact
finding committee and the Uni
versity's committee <>1 academic
inquiry is not being upheld.

"Kvidence of scientific miscon
duct should he submitted to the
University, not the hospital,"
Spirtos said.
