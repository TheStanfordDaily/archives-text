1969
On November 14, 1909, The Daily pub
lished an article called "Weird Militant
11 ere" about a certain (ieneral Waste-More-
Land.
" ' I'm working on a ( lirisimas special to
bring all («ls home to visit Hob Hope, («en
eral Waste-More-Land said as he perused
an aghast group ol Stanford I)aily-ites yes
terday.
" 1 lie (ieneral just wandered in, as he has
lor the List lout years at toss the country.
I lis policy has been to give "undeclared
speeches, in undeclared places, at unde
clared times —as long as Nixon continues
to wage an undeclared and therefore an un
constitutional war. ..
" '(ieneral I lershey Bat has triumphed

lull olnuts.
"Waste-Morc-Land claimed his chemical
experts in the Pentagon have discovered
the clillerence between LSI) and President
Nixon. 'LSD is a drug, while Nixon is a
dope,' lie explained."
Bottom line: Sounds good to me. Let's find this
guy now and end our election shenanigans in
Florida.
