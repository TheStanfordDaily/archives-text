An agreement reached Monday fol
lowing a 47-day walkout by nurses at
Washington Hospital Center points to
the growing activism by nurses on be
half of patient care.
The tentative accord gives the nurses
the right to ref use overtime work when
they are too tired to give good care.
"Overworked and overfatigued
nurses cannot give the quality care,
day in and day out," said Mindy
Blandon, a registered nurse and mem
ber of the negotiating team with the
hospital. . .
Nurses said the hospital has been
relying on overtime because it's cheap
er than hiring a sufficient number of
full-time nurses. Similar protests are
rising across the country, as hospital
corporations have focused on cost-cut
ting.
