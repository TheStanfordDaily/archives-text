## The
						Stanford Daily Stadium ad removal a principled decision 
### 
Published Since IS9I

IN T1 IK LVSTdavs ofhis presidency, Ger
hard (lasper directed the Athletic Depart
ment to remove all corporate advertise
ments Irom its facilities, an action for which
we commend the former president. With
Casper's decree, the University made a small
but significant step towards remembering its
true mission as reasserting its priorities.
Universities should promote the quest for
knowledge above all other interests. Because
ihev are responsible for education, universi
ties are inherentlv powerful institutions. II
11 lev succeed in promoting their higher ideals,
their power can enlighten society and provide
unimagined benefits.
In recent times, Stanford's interests have too
often become intertwined with corporate inter
ests. This is not to sav that having corporate in
terests is inherentlv wrong; corporations are

vital institutions, as they supply markets with
critical goods and services. But a university's in
terests should be greater and nobler than that of
anv corporation. Where a corporation seeks
profit, a university should seek truth.
By displaying corporate advertisements at
sporting events, Stanford compromised its ide
als. The corners of the Maples Pavilion score
boards may not be the most sacred places on
campus or the proper forum for general en
lightenment, but they are I niversity property
nonetheless. ) iist as no one would stand fora
corporate logo on the faces of Hoover lower,
the grassv lawn of the ()val, or the brick tiles of
the Quad, we should not tolerate siu li logos on
the walls of our stadiums. This is simply a matter
of principle.
I n fortunately, this principle has been ne
glected in other instances, lake, for example,

the General Motors classroom in Thornton
Center. General Motors does not stand for the
pursuit of knowledge; its managers are bound
by the ethos of profit.
Some in the university have voiced concern
that Casper's decision will substantially re
duce the size of the athletic department bud
get. Even if this is true, the athletic depart
ment (or an\ department for that matter)
should investigate alternate sources of fund
ing that do not compromise the values of this
institution.
As mentioned above, we believe that it is im
portant to respect every parcel of the Univer
sity's space out of principle. But there is also a
problem with the image that the University
presents to its fans, not to mention the nation
al audience that its various athletic tains have
attracted in recent years.

In effect, staclium ads communicate a cer
tain message to people that the L niversity is
for sale. With these ads, the University is
also telling us that it needs help from cor
porations to function, although this is not
the case.
Pieces of this university, or any other uni
versity, should not be sold to the highest bid
der. Casper was right to remove ads from ath
letic facilities. But, again, that was a small step
in the right direction. We should thank him
for re-prioritizing the values of this institution,
but we should also push our current presi
dent, and the Board of Trustees, to do away
with more pervasive, less apparent corporate
influence at Stanford. Ib remain true to itself
and serve its real customers, the students,
Stanford must plate its academic mission
above its business interests.
