# I HAVE ISSUES
## The 						diversity of democracy 
### 
Allow me t<> be extremely idealistic
loi ,i moment, |olm l.ennon-siyle.
Wouldn't it be great if the entire
world were one big democracy?
Hanieis to international trade would be
non-existent because the concept ol "inter
national would cease to exist. Flows ol
labor, capital, goods and services through
out the world would be eniirelv efficient. Kv
ervlhing would go to the i iglit places at the
light limes. Militarx deiense (other than
from little green men) would be completeh
unnecessary.
We could take ibis ideal world one step

further to envision a big
Melting Pot from which
an cthnicity-liee "world
people" would emerge.
Hut let's not because
people are different and
we should < licrish those
dillerenc es. Ihe multi
plicity of languages and
foods throughout the
world is mereh a surface
indicator of the various

wavs in which people approach life and
perceive the world around thcni. Without
these dillcrcnt perspectives, the human
race would <|tii< kl\ stagnate.
I )emo( racy, in some form, is a good |»c>-
111i< al system because n allows for diversity
among humans. Democracy provides a
forum for discussion and uses the com
mon ground generated In that exchange
to produce a functional government
through majorit\-rule voles. Although
this is a simplified and inexact wax ofde
s( ribing democ rac\. n shows the power of
democ rac \ to work through peoples' in
herent differences of opinion.
I he alternative is to ei adicate those dif
lerenc cs or regard them .is barriers to any
possible common ground. In effect, this
creates <i minority-rules system, with
despotism, Socialism or anarchy as the
only other options for society.
Democ racA preserves differences by
generating a system that tolerates those
differences. Its major accomplishment lies
in bringing together great numbers of di
verse people and providing them with the
ability to co-exist. And that idea is at the
heart of my ideal world — one in which di
versity remains but everyone lives in the
same political environment. I his unified
world, though, is not a realistic goal for
which to strive. Rather, it is an ideal to
ward which to work.
In light of this goal, let's examine a
statement I've heard a lot lately: "The
Electoral College needs to die."
I completely agree. The elections of
I87(>. 1888 and 2000 have shown that the

Klectoral College can thwart the overall
popular will. ()nce the majorits no longei
i ules, democ rat \ is undermined. It fright
ens me that some people have defended
the Klectoral ( ollege In pointing to the
lac i that the name I nited States ol Ameri
ca means .1 conglomeration ol semi-inde
pendent stales rather than a single state
governing a mass ol people.
Sure, the slates act independenlh on
some political mailers and local govern
ment pla\ s.t \ ii.il role as well. I lowever, on
mailers ol national scope, the w hole coun
ir\ should arrive at its own decision. 11.
due to systemic obstacles, we Americans
can't even decide who our president is.
what hope remains lor am meaningful
unification among nations in the future?
I he c urrent debate over the Klectoral
( ollege illustrates a disturbing propensits
among people to divide themselves on any
teaclih available basis. I 01 example, SO
percent of conversations I held in my
freshman dorm revolved around the fact
that I s.t\ "on line" instead of "in line" 01
pronounce the woid "horrible 'as "hahl i
bit-" because I'm from New Yawk. We're
111 big trouble il Stanford students need to
dwell c)ii pelt\ diHerein es such as regie >nal
speech patterns, or even on not-so-pettv
distinctions such as race, gentler and
socio-economic background.
II should be obvious how similar we .ill
are. Indeed, ever) Stanford student had
access to priman and secondary educa
tion and grew up with enough nutritional
sustenance to fiilh develop. I .1111 not
si ret c hing 11 by pointing out these similar
ities. Simph spend some time 111 southern
Sudan to see my point.
IV) acknowledge our differences is im
portant. hut it is as important to recognize
the common ground upon which we might
build <1 lasting political structure founded
upon our diversity. More localized govern
ment is essential because governing huge
numbers of people day-to-day via one cen
tral entity is impossible. It is vital, however,
th,it we realize the overarching role a central
government can play in unifying large num
bers of people so that political divisions that
will quickly become barriers may be kepi it)
a minimum.
So I say yes. Klectoral College, die. And
die quickly at the hands of a terminator to
be known, hopefully, as the 28th Amend
ment to the Constitution. It happened as
recently as 1992, and it can happen again.
Long live the popular vote and the popu
lar consciousness that comes along with it.
