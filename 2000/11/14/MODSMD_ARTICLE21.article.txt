Misinformation in pro-choice letter
I was interested to read Marissa
I reinen, Anne Bet r\ and Eva St. (Haiti 's
letter to I lie l)ail\, "Demand Mote from
\oui IMo-(Choice (Candidates" on election
dav, Nov. 7. People who care about
women's health, as tliev do. must remem
ber the importance of education, health
<m<l support programs lot all women and
families, not just those faced with an unac
ceptable pregnancy. However, I was em
barrassed by the amount of medical misin
formation contained in the letter.
I o set the record straight:
All ( links, including those where abor
tions may be performed, keep records,
know what to do in case of complications
and follow up with patients where possible.
Doctors always provide the details and
risks of medical procedures to obtain in
formed consent, and abortion providers
are not an exception. 1 )o( tors never "leave
babies to die;'' it is the duty of our profes
sion to provide quality care for all prema
turely born infants!
The youngest babies to survive indepen
dently are weeks old, though they re
quire intensive life support. However, KH
percent of abortions take place in the first 12
weeks of pregnancy, in the embryonic or
fetal stages of development. Ninety-nine
percent of abortions occur by 21 weeks, well
before the current limit of viability. Babies
are never "born alive" during abortions.
That process occurs much later in pregnan
cy and is called "delivery."
Abortion is the most common surgical

procedure for women in the I nited
Stales, and 43 percent of women will have
had at least one b\ the age ol 45. Purists
who believe iluit even a 12-week leius has
.Iright to live within its mothei sboch mav
have a legitimate moral argument, but
maligning the medical profession under

Election aftermath results from the system
In response to Friday's many criticisms
ofthe presidential election, there are some
tilings that we should all. in our attempt to
be "fair and non-partisan" (as Newsome
suggests) recall.
Florida election law calls for changes in
the ballot to be made prior to Election
Day. The particular ballot in question was
approved by a Democrat election official
and was printed in the local newspapers
for voter review. To hold a re-election in
that coutity would charge one county with
deciding the outcome of the election. If
people feel angry and misrepresented
now, imagine not one state, but one coun
ty shouldering the burden of choosing our
next president.
In regards to the Electoral (College de
bate, it is important to remember that both
candidates campaigned with this system in
mind. If the rules ofthe game were popu
lar vote, Gore would have spent a lot more
time in Texas and Bush in Massachusetts

campaigning lor those individual voles
ilic\ both counted as lost in our particular
electoral s\ stem.
While we can look at the popular vote
.is a mandate lo change the presidential
election process, we cannot now use it as
prool that, if one candidate wins the Elec
toral College vote and loses the popular
vote, they are not ihe "real" president.
Such a mentality serves only to further di
vide. Whomever is chosen as our next
president deserves the respect that the of
fice commands.
These weeks of waiting are a terrible
trench warfare for our country. In your
lights, be gentle on the middle of the coun
try — those square slates that you have
likely never visited and have names that
fifth grade geography classes forget. But,
more than names, there are people, too
small to see while flying from Hast Coast to
West, but believe me they are there. It is
possible to spend most of your life safe
112 rom them in your cities. Luckily there was
this once-in-a-lifetime moment in which
the election booth forced a realization that
they, for all their faults, are your peers.

Supervisors should save open space
We all know that wide open spaces are
good for the heart and for the soul. The
Stanford Foothills open space and trails
nourish Stanford and 0111 community in
untold ways. 1 urge the Santa Clara Coun
ty Board of Supervisors to include perma
nent protection for the Stanford Foothills
when they vote Nov. 27 on Stanford's
Ceneral Use Permit.
Can we trust Stanford to preserve the
F< xt hills?
Some people ma\ believe Stanford's

on the 1 >isli Foothills. I lowever, page 4(iol

Phase 1" maps out ideal development sites
in ilu- Foothills. The 1 ( .)«S7 plan shows
building pads and development "cluster
opportunities" laid out along a new road.
In fact, ii looks as if the road shown in ibis

"environmentalh sensitive" asphalt road
built by Stanford this summer. I Immm.

If my memory serves me, this Foothills

Stanford proposed the Reagan Library for
the Dish. Hack then, as now, students and
the conm'iunitN banded together to protest
development in the Foothills, 1 lie Dish and
Foothills area is a precious jewel that many
cherish enough to fight for.
1 urge the Supervisors to listen to the
people and to not be bullied by the power

vote to protect the Stanlord Foothills per
manently, for the good of everyone.

Misinformation in pro-choice letter
I was interested to read Marissa
I reinen, Anne Bet r\ and Eva St. (Haiti 's
letter to I lie l)ail\, "Demand Mote from
\oui IMo-(Choice (Candidates" on election
dav, Nov. 7. People who care about
women's health, as tliev do. must remem
ber the importance of education, health
<m<l support programs lot all women and
families, not just those faced with an unac
ceptable pregnancy. However, I was em
barrassed by the amount of medical misin
formation contained in the letter.
I o set the record straight:
All ( links, including those where abor
tions may be performed, keep records,
know what to do in case of complications
and follow up with patients where possible.
Doctors always provide the details and
risks of medical procedures to obtain in
formed consent, and abortion providers
are not an exception. 1 )o( tors never "leave
babies to die;'' it is the duty of our profes
sion to provide quality care for all prema
turely born infants!
The youngest babies to survive indepen
dently are weeks old, though they re
quire intensive life support. However, KH
percent of abortions take place in the first 12
weeks of pregnancy, in the embryonic or
fetal stages of development. Ninety-nine
percent of abortions occur by 21 weeks, well
before the current limit of viability. Babies
are never "born alive" during abortions.
That process occurs much later in pregnan
cy and is called "delivery."
Abortion is the most common surgical

procedure for women in the I nited
Stales, and 43 percent of women will have
had at least one b\ the age ol 45. Purists
who believe iluit even a 12-week leius has
.Iright to live within its mothei sboch mav
have a legitimate moral argument, but
maligning the medical profession under
mines the credibility of their cause.

Election aftermath results from the system
In response to Friday's many criticisms
ofthe presidential election, there are some
tilings that we should all. in our attempt to
be "fair and non-partisan" (as Newsome
suggests) recall.
Florida election law calls for changes in
the ballot to be made prior to Election
Day. The particular ballot in question was
approved by a Democrat election official
and was printed in the local newspapers
for voter review. To hold a re-election in
that coutity would charge one county with
deciding the outcome of the election. If
people feel angry and misrepresented
now, imagine not one state, but one coun
ty shouldering the burden of choosing our
next president.
In regards to the Electoral (College de
bate, it is important to remember that both
candidates campaigned with this system in
mind. If the rules ofthe game were popu
lar vote, Gore would have spent a lot more
time in Texas and Bush in Massachusetts

campaigning lor those individual voles
ilic\ both counted as lost in our particular
electoral s\ stem.
While we can look at the popular vote
.is a mandate lo change the presidential
election process, we cannot now use it as
prool that, if one candidate wins the Elec
toral College vote and loses the popular
vote, they are not ihe "real" president.
Such a mentality serves only to further di
vide. Whomever is chosen as our next
president deserves the respect that the of
fice commands.
These weeks of waiting are a terrible
trench warfare for our country. In your
lights, be gentle on the middle of the coun
try — those square slates that you have
likely never visited and have names that
fifth grade geography classes forget. But,
more than names, there are people, too
small to see while flying from Hast Coast to
West, but believe me they are there. It is
possible to spend most of your life safe
112 rom them in your cities. Luckily there was
this once-in-a-lifetime moment in which
the election booth forced a realization that
they, for all their faults, are your peers.

Supervisors should save open space
We all know that wide open spaces are
good for the heart and for the soul. The
Stanford Foothills open space and trails
nourish Stanford and 0111 community in
untold ways. 1 urge the Santa Clara Coun
ty Board of Supervisors to include perma
nent protection for the Stanford Foothills
when they vote Nov. 27 on Stanford's
Ceneral Use Permit.
Can we trust Stanford to preserve the
F< xt hills?
Some people ma\ believe Stanford's
< laini thai they have no intention to hnild
on the 1 >isli Foothills. I lowever, page 4(iol
Stanford's 11)«S7 "Foothills Region Plan —
Phase 1" maps out ideal development sites
in ilu- Foothills. The 1 ( .)«S7 plan shows
building pads and development "cluster
opportunities" laid out along a new road.
In fact, ii looks as if the road shown in ibis
1 ( .)<S7 plan lollows the exact path ol the
"environmentalh sensitive" asphalt road
built by Stanford this summer. I Immm.

If my memory serves me, this Foothills
Region Plan was published around the lime
Stanford proposed the Reagan Library for
the Dish. Hack then, as now, students and
the conm'iunitN banded together to protest
development in the Foothills, 1 lie Dish and
Foothills area is a precious jewel that many
cherish enough to fight for.
1 urge the Supervisors to listen to the
people and to not be bullied by the power
ful Stanlord .Administrators. I hope they
vote to protect the Stanlord Foothills per
manently, for the good of everyone.
