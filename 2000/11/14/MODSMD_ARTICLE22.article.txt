## Decisions, decisions: How not to write a 40-year plan 
### MATT BENTLEY GUEST COLUMNIST 
Today, you'll make a decision thai
will change the course oi't he rest
of your life. Choose wisely and
suet ess, happiness and 112 ulfill
ment shall all he yours. ('.hoose poorh and
spend the rest of your days in destitution
and sullering.
No. I'm not talking about the election —
despite all (lit- drama and anticipation in
volved in tli.it decision, ii turns out that
your choke realh mattered only it 'you re
side in Florida. And I'm certainly not refer
ring to your choice of major. Despite all the
agonizing "personal exploration" and the
hours spent conjuring up a plausible career
path to please mom and dad. your major
ultimately has little ellect on your lile.
No, none of these purportedly "heavy"
choices that we grapple with will have the
impact of a small decision you will make
today, perhaps without even a moment's
reflection.

What trivial decision is of such earth
shattering consequence? Read on to find
out.
But first let me give you some lips on
the process to follow when it comes to that
critical moment. In decision-analysis theo
-1 v, the world exists as a series of potential
paths. Kat h path leads to one of several
outcomes with a certain probability. By as
signing a value to each of those outcomes
.ind taking a probability-weighted average
lor each path, the most desirable path can
be easily found. Its neat, rational and fun.
Now win doesn't the real world work that
way?
flie problem, of course, is that at each
moment we face an infinite number of
paths. ()ur neat decision tree sprouts into
a chat >tic web so that a butterfly Happing its
wings in New York causes a typhoon in
I'okvo. ()r .i bureaucrat's decision to use a
butterlly-style folding ballot in Palm Beach
leads to the ovei turning of Roe v. 11 tide in
the Supreme C'.ourt.
I low cruel iliat we never know which

of our decisions may have such dramat
ic consequences! Let me give a personal
example:
In August, 1999, I laced the lightest of
decisions. On a bumpy 12-hour bus ride
from Bucharest to Istanbul, 1 had be
friended a Romanian law student, and she
wanted to know il 1 would like to spend the
next day touring Istanbul with her? In
typical male non-committal fashion, I
replied with a resounding, "uhhhh,
maybe ..." and was on a bus out of town
a lew hours later.
At 3:01 a.m. the next morning, a 7.4
earthquake struck Istanbul, killing 40,000
people and leaving much of the city in
ruins. A hundred-odd miles down the
Turkish coast, my bus hardly even rocked.
But, in the wake of this tragedy, il was ob
vious that my lile could have been vet \ dil
ferent as the result of a decision made on a
whim. I lus realization makes it dillic till lo
worry much about the impact a late prob
lem set or a ( '. on a midterm will have oil
mv lilt*.

The conclusion I seem headed towards
is that, due to lile's randomness, nothing
we do matters. Spend the evening study
ing or spend it getting trashed with your
friends — who's to say which will lead to
ilr- best outcome? The lormer may lead to
an A on an exam, but the latter to the
founding of a startup that brings you
fame, fortune and fulfillment.
In lieu ol the analysis-paralysis that
such a conclusion brings, I propose an al
ternative: Embrace the unexpected in lile.
Many people at Stanford are eonstanth
struggling to "keep on track,'' to always
make the right decision in preparation for
graduate school or a professional career.
I lie decision trees of most Stanford stu
dents are shaped like pines. In the begin
ning, they have many options lor branch
ing out, but, as they continue further up
the trunk, alternative paths become
sparse. Instead, a healthy decision tree
blossoms outward like an oak. 1 lie diver
sit) of options should relied the reality
that we are students at a fabulous universi

ty during a lime ol unprecedented pros
perity and international cooperation.
So don't be afraid tostra\ from ilie path
