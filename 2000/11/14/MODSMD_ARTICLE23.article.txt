# Black squirrels' secrets revealed
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD 
Every year a new batch of stu
dents discover one of the Farm's
most mysterious inhabitants —
black squirrels. These critters are
spotted scavenging for food, ( bas
ing each other around tree trunks
and, of course, running across the
street while narrowly avoiding
oncoming bicvcle and automobile
traffic.
"I'm amazed that it's not our
mascot," freshman Charlotte
Feng said. "They're really smart.
I hex know how to cross the road
belter than us."
Myths abound about this sable
rodent, so pet haps it's time to set
the record straight.
I hose dark colored squirrels
seen frolicking around campus
are actualh mclanistic — think
colored — variants ol two dilfer
ent squirrel species, according to
Biological Sciences Prof. Craig
Heller.
Both species are eastern squir
rels introduced to this area dur
ing the last century.
Sciurus carolensis, the com
mon eastern tree squirrel, is the
smaller ol the two. Sciurus niger,
the lox squirrel, is about 20 pet
cent larger and in more prevalent
on c ampus.
While si/e ma\ not seem like
much ol ,i distinction, there are
other wa\s to distinguish between
the two types.
"II von wanted to catch one, we
could identify it by its teeth. II you
don't want to catc li one, probably
the best indicator would be that
carolinensis has white fur on its
bell\ while niger has darker fur

on lis belly," I Idler said.
I he Mark variation is a natu
rally occurring phenomenon and
some area residents claim the
number of squirrels ih.it exhibit
the trait appear to have increased
with time.
"1 here are more of them now
than there were 10 years ago," said
1 )oris Inunenthun, a salesperson at
the Stanford Shopping (Center and
long-time area resident.
I Idler attributes the phen<>me
non to "evolution in action."
"When I came to Stanford al
most 1\() years ago the black vali
ant was rather rare and the gra\
variant was common. Now n is the
reverse," he said.

I he squirrels are .tlso popular
among I he numerous tourists thai
\ isii campus each year.
" 1 he squirrels are so cute. I've
had tourists ask me to take pic
tures ol them with the squirrels,"
said sophomore Sarah kilt hell.
However, some students and
fa< ulty are not quite so enamored
with the creatures, finding them
more pesky than appealing.
"They look like rats," French
and Italian l'rol". Brigitte ('.a/elles
said.
"I have gray, brown and bla< k
squirrels in my backyard and
l)l«t( k squirt els are at the top of the
hierarchy. They are much mote
aggressive."
