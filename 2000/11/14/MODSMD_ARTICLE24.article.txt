So you're nol exactly a Michelangelo or a Rem
brandt, but you still love art and working with lit
tle kids. Artspan might be just the program lor
you, its founders say.
Artspan is a non-profit organization dedicated
to art education and instruction. Students from
Stanford and local high schools volunteer to teach
after-school art to underprivileged students in
Redwood City. The organization hopes to ex
pand into Kast I'alo Alto as well.
Although Artspan focuses 011 local schools, it is
part of a larger organization that encompasses
the entire Bay Area.
Junior Annie (lhau founded Artspan while she
was still iu high school.
Mam of the current volunteers are still high
s< hool students, although some Stanford students
also help out.
()ne of the main goals of Artspan is to supple
ment s< hool art programs. At most public schools,
art is the first class to disappear in order to save
money during times of financial hardship.
Artspan is also an alternative to other, more ex
pensive out-of-sc'hool art programs.
I he program also reaches out 10 children from
broken homes. ()ften, these children need a was
to reach out and communicate, and art is one way
ol accomplishing this goal, (-ban said.
Regardless of the status of their home lives,
Artspan is a means of keeping all kids out ol trou
ble. The program also has positive goals, such as

boosting sell-esteem and art appreciation.
Many of the student artists display their work
in an exhibit at the end of classes.
"Artspan hopes to foster positive attitudes and
pride in its participants by having the students
works exhibited, giving the students a sense of re
ward and accomplishment,' said sophomore
Mike Cuialo, the volunteer coordinator for
Artspan.
Artspan classes cover a variety of artistic topics
including sketching, painting and sculpting.
These classes explore a wide range of related top
ics, su< li as multiculturalism, education, problem
solving and art history.
Sue li diverse lessons would appear to require an
extensive knowledge ol art and teaching experience.
"A lot of prospective volunteers wonder il they
have to be artistic to participate, and our answer
to that is 'nope!' " said Cutalo.
I hese student volunteers have several respon
sibilities, including organizing lesson plans and
teaching.
Prior to teaching, volunteers ninsi attend in
formation and training sessions. I here, they
learn about Artspan, how to construct a lesson
plan and other useful tips for working at after
school (enters. These sessions happen through
out the year.
Though the time commitment is flexible, vol
unteei s are encouraged to volunteer once a week
so that they can develop meaningful relationships
with their tnentorees. 112 fowever, all student teach
ers are welcome to teach as often or as rarely as
their schedules allow.
