## Women's hoops aims for success 
### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
I he stage was set: lour returning
starters, eight returning letter-win
ners and a lleet of five impressive
freshman recruits. The Stanford
women looked to he unstoppable.
At their core was sophomore
guard Jamie Carey. Not only did
the 2000 Pacific 10 Conference
Freshman of the Year oiler a
daunting three-point shooting
presence, Carey could also confi
dently execute the ollense and run
the point.
Fast-lbward to Monday, No
vember (>. Just three days before
the C Cardinal was scheduled to kick
oil its season, and just a week after
she was named to the pre-season
all-Pac-10 squad, Carey an
nounced that due to recurrent
concussion problems she was
forced to end her collegiate career.
The Cardinal was left grap
pling. The pre-season rankings
had already come out. Stanford
was picked to win it's 10th Pac-10
title, and found itself at a comfort
able 14th in the national rankings.
1 lowever with each small blurb in
sports magazines throughout the
country highlighting the play of
their sophomore guard, the team
was left with questions of who
would lill the critical role.

"You take someone like Jamie
out and you are like what's next?"
said head coach l at a VanDerveer.
"But we've got a lot of weapons."
I he Stanford women shouldn't
be written oil so quickly. While the
void of Carey can probably never be
filled by a single player, the roster is
still stacked with plenty of talent.
"It's a puzzle, and we are just
going to have to put it together in
a different way now that Jamie is
gone," said junior Cori Knghusen.
"It has been stressful, but we are
clicking together really well, and
getting through as best as we can."
Leading the way are many ol
the newcomers to the Stanford
squad, most visibly freshman for
ward Nicole Powell. Listed at 6-
loot-2, the rookie brings strong in
side presence on the boards. She
led the USA Junior World Cham
pionship team in rebounding this
summer. But Powell's biggest asset
is clearly her versatility; she can
run the point, shoot from the out
side and post up inside, serving as
a threat from any position.
"Powell's got great skills and
needs to remain poised and confi
dent." said VanDerveer. "She
makes other people look g<>od and
is fun to watch."
