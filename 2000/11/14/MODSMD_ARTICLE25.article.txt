## Women's hoops aims for success 
### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
I he stage was set: lour returning
starters, eight returning letter-win
ners and a lleet of five impressive
freshman recruits. The Stanford
women looked to he unstoppable.
At their core was sophomore
guard Jamie Carey. Not only did
the 2000 Pacific 10 Conference
Freshman of the Year oiler a
daunting three-point shooting
presence, Carey could also confi
dently execute the ollense and run
the point.
Fast-lbward to Monday, No
vember (>. Just three days before
the C Cardinal was scheduled to kick
oil its season, and just a week after
she was named to the pre-season
all-Pac-10 squad, Carey an
nounced that due to recurrent
concussion problems she was
forced to end her collegiate career.
The Cardinal was left grap
pling. The pre-season rankings
had already come out. Stanford
was picked to win it's 10th Pac-10
title, and found itself at a comfort
able 14th in the national rankings.
1 lowever with each small blurb in
sports magazines throughout the
country highlighting the play of
their sophomore guard, the team
was left with questions of who
would lill the critical role.

"You take someone like Jamie
out and you are like what's next?"
said head coach l at a VanDerveer.
"But we've got a lot of weapons."
I he Stanford women shouldn't
be written oil so quickly. While the
void of Carey can probably never be
filled by a single player, the roster is
still stacked with plenty of talent.
"It's a puzzle, and we are just
going to have to put it together in
a different way now that Jamie is
gone," said junior Cori Knghusen.
"It has been stressful, but we are
clicking together really well, and
getting through as best as we can."
Leading the way are many ol
the newcomers to the Stanford
squad, most visibly freshman for
ward Nicole Powell. Listed at 6-
loot-2, the rookie brings strong in
side presence on the boards. She
led the USA Junior World Cham
pionship team in rebounding this
summer. But Powell's biggest asset
is clearly her versatility; she can
run the point, shoot from the out
side and post up inside, serving as
a threat from any position.
"Powell's got great skills and
needs to remain poised and confi
dent." said VanDerveer. "She
makes other people look g<>od and
is fun to watch."

oil its season, and just a week after
she was named to the pre-season
all-Pac-10 squad, Carey an
nounced that due to recurrent
concussion problems she was
forced to end her collegiate career.
The Cardinal was left grap
pling. The pre-season rankings
had already come out. Stanford
was picked to win it's 10th Pac-10
title, and found itself at a comfort
able 14th in the national rankings.
1 lowever with each small blurb in
sports magazines throughout the
country highlighting the play of
their sophomore guard, the team
was left with questions of who
would lill the critical role.

"You take someone like Jamie
out and you are like what's next?"
said head coach l at a VanDerveer.
"But we've got a lot of weapons."
I he Stanford women shouldn't
be written oil so quickly. While the
void of Carey can probably never be
filled by a single player, the roster is
still stacked with plenty of talent.
"It's a puzzle, and we are just
going to have to put it together in
a different way now that Jamie is
gone," said junior Cori Knghusen.
"It has been stressful, but we are
clicking together really well, and
getting through as best as we can."
Leading the way are many ol
the newcomers to the Stanford
squad, most visibly freshman for
ward Nicole Powell. Listed at 6-
loot-2, the rookie brings strong in
side presence on the boards. She
led the USA Junior World Cham
pionship team in rebounding this
summer. But Powell's biggest asset
is clearly her versatility; she can
run the point, shoot from the out
side and post up inside, serving as
a threat from any position.
"Powell's got great skills and
needs to remain poised and confi
dent." said VanDerveer. "She
makes other people look g<>od and
is fun to watch."

Rounding out the freshman squad, are

(Cardinal box score.
Basketball is becoming a versatile game and
the freshman ( lass is very versatile," said Van-
Dervcer. "Bui the S or 7.5 returners have
helped them to gel where tliev are right now."
Willi the troop ol talented freshmen, it is
eas\ to overlook the experience that will play
sut hat i itk al role on this vear's team.
I lie twin lowers, senior ( arolvn Moos and
junioi Cori Knglnisen, listed at (»-C> and (i-7
respcctivelv, are critical to the Cardinal's
s( oi ing and i ebounding success.
While Moos led the team ins( oring last vear

the guards to pick up I he slack. In her senii >r sea

Knghusen looks more confident in her turn

Returning as lbrwardsare senior Sarah I Vin

I/idol, lhe three competed tor playing lime
las! season, and all have lhe talent to reallv take
over a game. Dimson is .in excellent dclensive
player, while Donaphin is one of the teams lead
ing rebounders.
(Completing the roster are junior guard / for
wards Lindsey V'amasaki and Lauren St. Clair.
Yamasaki led the Cardinal in scoring in her
freshman campaign, however she joined the
team last season alter playing on the Stanford
volleyball team. This year, lhe junior is back to
only basketball and could really pilot the squad.
Si. (Jail returns as one of the critical players on
the Stanford roster, after finishing first in the
conference in three-point shooting percentage
and gaining all-Pac-10 honorable mention hon
ors. She can quietly rack up the points from be
yond the arc.
So with a slew of new talent and a wealth ol
experience the only question that remains is
who is going to step up and control the (Cardi
nal squad. If the freshmen tome through and
the returners work the few remaining kinks out
ol their game their is no limiting what we could
see from ibis years team.
"Kven without some of our best weapons, we
can si ill do a good job." said St. Clair. "People
are understanding their roles, even if it is not
the role then expected, tliev are performing."
And even though jainie (Carc\ will be spend
