### EMILY ST. THOMAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Not many teams would have wanted to be
Stanford field hockey on Saturday morning:
facing the top-ranked team in the country in
a must-win situation, 3000 miles from home.
Despite a few glimmers of hope, the team
lost to the Old Dominion Lady Monarchs
(22-1) 0-1 and ended its season and stint in
the NCAA Field 1 hx key Championships. But
just making it to the tournament serves as a

starting point lor the very young Cardinal
held hockey squad (11\-1 1 overall, 1-2 North
ern Pacific Conference) as ihey look to im
prove next season.
Old Dominion, ranked No. 1 in both I lie
NCAA and tlu- SIX NFHCA National
Coaches' poll, simply proved too much for
the Cardinal in Saturday's first-round game.
The Lady Monarchs took an early lead just
lour minutes into the game on a goal In
Laura Stedman.
The Cardinal, however, refused to be shut
out and answered back to tie the game when
NorPac Defensive Player of the Month junior
Melissa Stai tallied Stanford's only score of
the game. Junior Erica Swesey and team cap
tain se Michelle Scott, a senior, each record
ed an assist on the play.
()ld Dominion refused to be matched on
its own turf and answered the C Cardinal's lone

goal with three of iis own to go up l-l at the
half. Scoring two more goals in ihe second
half, the Lady Monarchs finished Stanford
off 6-1. The liigli scorer for the game was Ma
rina DiCiacomo, who tallied three goals for
the Lad\ Monarchs.
DiCiacomo, an integral part of Old Do
minion's dominant e this season, passed up an
opportunity to pla\ on the (Myinpic team this
fall in order to play with the I ady Monarchs.
I hi' most impressive performance of the
dav came from Stanford junior goalie Rebet ca
Shapiro, October's NorPac Defensive Player
oft he Month. ()ld Dominion out-shot the (Car
dinal I tol, but Shapiro did her part to keep
Stanford in the game, recording 22 saves.

cess lliis season. lUt I IS saves
