"When I recruited Nicole I kind of thought she
was a Teresa Edwards" said head coach lata Van-
Derveer of her freshman stand-out Nicole Powell
Thursday.
It isn't too shabby being likened to a five-time
(Mympian alter just a single college exhibition game.
Cardinal fans in Maples Pavillion last Thursday,
would have lew disputes with VanDerveer's high
praise after watching Powell dribble, pass, rebound
and shoot her way to a triple-double in Stanford s
104-55 exhibition game win over R I I Clondica of
Latvia.
Powell was by no means the only player that
looked good. Six players on the C.ardinal roster
notched double-digits in the scoring column, and
every player that suited up scored at least lour
points.
One of the most surprising contributions of the
night came from junior center Cori Enghusen, who
tallied 18 points and six rebounds in only 14 minutes
of playing time. Enghusen averaged only 5.4 points

per game last season, and demonstrated by lief play
last week that she is itching to play a larger role on
this years team.
"Cori has been working really hard in practice,"
said head coach fata VanDerveer. "When she does
what she is really capable of doing, which is posting
up big, getting the ball and finishing, she is unstop
pable."
Stanford's success came without the play of fresh
men Susan King and (Ihelsea I rotter, who were out
ill. VanDerveer promises the newcomers will be two
more strong weapons in the (Cardinal arsenal.
"Chelsea would have torn this /one up," said Van-
Derveer. "And Susan would have started lot us this
evening."
Without King to captain the point guard posi
tion, the (i' 2" Powell, ran the team lor the majority
of the game. The freshman < laims she is more com
fortable in the forward position, in which she can
post-up then come outside, however her perfor
mance at point lelt some questioning her modesty.
In addition to her 1.3 points and 10 rebounds, she
posted Milena I lores-like numbers in the assist col
umn, finding her teammates 10 times lot the pass
and completion.
Coming in off the bench for Powell was fellow
freshman Katie Denny, who also handled the point
guard pressure well. Denny grabbed three steals in
the game.
