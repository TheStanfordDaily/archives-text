# Water polo splits final home games
## Stanford victorious over UC-Davis after falling to sixth-ranked Long Beach State 
### ELIZABETH MIIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After last week's nightmare
losses to top-ranked I (IL\ and
No. 2 USC, a split this weekend
should have spelled relief lor the
Stanford water polo team.
But, although the squad de
feated UC-l)avis . its loss to No. (i
Long Beach State possibh li.is
bigger implications on t lie ( ardi
nal's post-season dreams, than
losses to the top two teams in the
nation the previous week.
"It's a tough year and we're
prett\ inexperienced. For some
reason we don't have the intensi
ty this year." said assistant coach
Ben Quittner. "We get up on
ever\ game and in the second
half we just seem to give up.
We're not a mentally tough team
this year and hopefully it will
change next year."
Saturday's match-up against
Long Beach State (11-<s, 4-3
MI'SF) was no exception. After
holding a 4-1 first period lead,
the 49ers out scored the (Cardinal
( .M to take a I()-."> lead with • 1:4(>
left in the game. Despite Stan
lord's efforts, scoring three
straight goals late in the game to
bring the Cardinal within two
points of the lead, a late goal In
Long Beach State sealed the vic
lory lor the 49ers.
What made this game differ
ent past matches was the trans
parency in the Cardinal's de
fense. In previous games, the
lack of scoring lost the game lot
Stanford, hut in this game the
lac k ola strong defense was the
culprit.
"Nick Kllis in the goal has
saved us in the fust half of the
season and I think that there w.is
an illusion that we were playing
great defense," said head coach
Dante Dettamanti. "In case there
were any mistakes on defense, lie
would still be there. But he c an't
earn the defense b\ himself—

ilit' s have got in |»I.i \ betu i
