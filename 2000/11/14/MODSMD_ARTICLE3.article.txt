## 
### JIMMY WU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's ( lass of 1990 has set a
record for giving at the 10-year
mark, according to statistics obtained
after the most recent alnmni re
union. The ( lass generated a total of
$7.63 million in donations.
The Class of '90, which includes
Jerry Yang, the co-founder of Yahoo!
Inc., and his wife Akiko Yaniazaki, in
creased the previous Stanford 10-
year reunion donation record set in
1989 by more than ten-fold.
With the exponential growth of
the Internet beginning in the mid
19905, many of the alumni from the
Class of '90 were able to take advan
tage of this new wave of technology,
class members said.
Mike Maples Jr., vice president
and co-founder of Motive Commu
nications, said,"()ur class personifies
the first wave of Stanford entrepre

neurs who were 'raised on the Inter
net.' The Internet revolution in the
mid '90s just started as many of us
were just finishing grad school."
He added, "So I guess we were
just in the right plate at the right
time."
Sarah Huard, the ( lass giving ofli
cer in charge of the ( I.iss of 90 and
the associate director of the Stanford
Fund, attributes the record-setting
donation to the cohesiveness of the
class.
"Throughout the campaign,
[members of] the Class of '90 chal
lenged and inspired each other to do
great things for the I niversity,"
Huard said. "This type of challenge
and group eflort would not Ijeaseflec
tive if there wasn't such a strong class
identity."
Major donors from the (!lass of '90
expressed the same feelings about
their willingness to donate so much
money.

"Many Stanford alums see a very di
rect connection between the experi
ences, education and contacts they
made at Stanford and the success
they've had in their careers," said
Mi< liacl Wolfe, vice president of prod
ucts at Kana Consulting Services.
" I his is true especially for young alum
ni, who still have very immediate
memories of their college years."
Jonathan frail, manager of inter
national consulting at Kana, shares
the same sentiments.
" I he education I received and the
people I met at Stanford have been
key contributors to my professional
and financial success," hail said. "I
also met main of my closest friends
during that time. I see my gilt to Stan
lord as simply sharing the blessing of
the gilts I have been given.
"The alumni with whom 1 have
spoken are very proud of Stanford
and beholden professionally and per
sonally to what they gained during

their undergraduate years," lluard
added.
For every reunion year, a group of
30 classmates form a committee that
solicits gills. The committee works to
contact their c lassmates and ask them
to participate by giving a gilt in honor
of their reunion.
Most of the donors from theC ilassof
90 gave to I lie Stanford Fund, which
iK-nefits the Stanford undergraduate
program. Sixty percent of the money
from the Fund goes to scholarship, 30
percent is used lor teaching and learn
ing and the remaining 10 percent
helps student programs. Ihe larger
donors also endowed scholai ships and
professorships.
Among the 37.5 percent of the
class who participated, Yang and
Yama/.aki, Maples, I rail, Wolfe and
two anonymous donors each gave
$100,000 or more to the school.
Two other donors gave from
$50,000 to $99,999.
