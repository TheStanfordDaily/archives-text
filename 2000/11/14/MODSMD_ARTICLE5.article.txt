# Web problems bug students
## 
### AIMEE GRACE 
Since last week, students have been having prob
lems accessing popular Web sites such ;is I lot
mail.com, Google.com and the Foothill College
homepage from their residence computers.
Fthan Rikleen, network and systems adminis
trator for Residential Computing, said that the
problem was brought to his attention through
complaints from students and resident computer
consultants.
Students began having problems accessing these
popular sites as early as last week, frying to t each
one ol these sites resulted in a long wait and an
error page stating, "The page cannot be found.
Access returned alter a few days and then the
problem reoccurred. As of yesterday morning, the

sites were available again, fhe on-again, oil-again
availability of these popular Web sites has left stu
dents vexed.
Freshman Nicole Louie complained, "I have all
my mail forwarded to m\ I lotmail account, and it's
frustrating not to be able to get to it and not to know
what the problem is or when it will be fixed."
Rikleen explained that his team began investi
gating the problem b\ looking at the Stanford
routers and determined thai they were working
properly. I le said that there is "nothing wrong with
our configurations" and that the access difficulties
are definitely not a Stanford problem.
However, Rikleen agrees that the situation is
"annoying" lor students .is well as RCCs and the


NEMII DALAI/The Stanford Daily
computing department to whom
people have been complaining.
All computers on the II 1 ad
dress 128.12 — which includes
all residences except Crothers
Hall — have not been able to ac
cess these sites due to trouble
with litis address. Because Stan
lord's three Internet connections
— Genuity, Internet 2 and IWIX
(Palo Alto Information Ex
change) — are connected
through the Exodus network, the
problem was diret ted there.
Exodus lias since been in close
contact with Stanford.
However, Exodus has not re
ported that ii (bund anything
wrong with iis own network con
figurations and the Source of the
difficulties may therefore be a
routing problem within Ilotmail,
Google or Foothill College.
Because the University has
been unable to identify the
source of the problem it might
never lind out what the real cause
of the problem was or win it oc
curred.
Rikleen said that there is "no
way to diagnose the problem now

that it's "fixed."
He added that he hopes that
the access problems are now cor
rected indefinitely, but the last
ing effects are unclear.
Rikleen said that as far as he
knows, all Stanford buildings
other than residences have not
had access problems.

Students should go to the
Tresidder Lalßor Meyer Library
to reach these trouble sites if an
other problem occurs.
These recent access and rout
ing problems are unrelated to the
other recent slow network con
nections due to Stanford's newlv
capped bandwidth.
