INCITEMENT AND THE "CYNICAL USE OF CHILDREN"
Senior [South African] police officers have complained recently
that their efforts to deal with unrest are hampered by the
rioters' tactics, including the use of women and children as
"human shields," the absence of suspected leaders from the front
lines of most protests and the increased attacks on police,
particularly the township homes of black policemen.
-Los Angeles Times, June 3, 1985
"It's tragic to have a child fall in this violence, but there's
no reason for the IDF to fire one shot if there's no
violence...All we're trying to say is stop this incessant
incitement to violence. We are dealing with a situation in which
kids are cynically being used by being put on the front lines
where they may be killed, maimed or injured...lf a young boy
falls, it gives the Palestinians a lot of propaganda points.
Capt. Natan Golan, IDF Spokesman --St. Petersburg Times, October
18, 2000
-The Washington Post, July 21,1985
BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY
"Law and order has to be restored with strong and singleminded
action. The full power of the state has to be employed to this
end."
-Louis La Grange, Minister of Law and Order, commenting on the
violence which had at the time claimed 660 black lives and 2,400
injured against 11 dead and 357 injured from the South African
police and army. Financial Times, September 11, 1985
"If we do not see a change in the patterns of violence in the
next two days, we will regard this as a cessation by Arafat of
the peace process...and we will order the army and security
forces to use all means at their disposal to halt the violence."
-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak -Scotland on Sunday, October 8, 2000
STONES AND BOTTLES ARE WEAPONS TOO"
"A police spokesman said riot-squad patrols had been "confronted
by particularly violent mobs" and were "bombarded with petrol
bombs, half bricks and other objects."
-South African response to criticism about disproportionate
force used by police, after thirteen protestors had been killed
in one day in Mamelodi Township. The New York Times, November 23,1985
"What happened in recent days was not just a protest
demonstration, but rather a phenomenon of unprecedented
degree...The problem is the character of the confrontation, the
degree of confrontation between protesters and the police, who
are entitled, if there is real danger to life, to shoot."
-Israeli Internal Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami defending
Israel's use of lethal force against civilian protestors. Los Angeles Times,
October 5, 2000
ON INTERNATIONAL INTERVENTION AND CRITICISM
"South Africa's decisions will be made by South Africa's leaders,
and the leaders of South Africa will themselves decide what is in
our interests," Botha said in Pretoria, the capital. "Reform can
only be retarded by outside attempts to interfere."
-President P.W. Botha, Los Angeles Times, September 10,1985
"Of course we say no [to a UN investigation]. We say that it
should be an American source of authority, maybe with Israelis
and Palestinians, of course, but not international body. And we
believe that this is an understandable position bearing in mind
our experience in this world in the last 52 years."
-Ehud Barak, CNN, October 12, 2000
