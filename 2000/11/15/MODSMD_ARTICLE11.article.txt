A common organic pesticide has
been linked to Parkinsons disease in
new research which backs up earlier
findings that people with long- term
exposure to weed-killers, such as
farmers, are more likely to develop the
disorder.
Scientists at Emory University in
Georgia discovered that rats which
were exposed to doses of the pesticide
over a period of weeks gradually lost
112 unction of the brain cells which pro
duce dopamine, used to transmit sig
nals inside the brain. . . .
The possibility of the link was
raised earlier this year by a team at
Stanford University in California,
which studied more than 1,000 peo
ple, half of whom had Parkinson's,
and found that those who had been
frequently exposed to pesticides were
twice as likely to develop the disease.
