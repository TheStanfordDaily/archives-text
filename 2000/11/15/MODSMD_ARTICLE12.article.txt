## U.S. accuses Germany of hypocrisy in executions 
### 
I I IK IIAGUK, Netherlands (AP) — American
lawyers on yesterda\ defended Arizona's execution of
two (iermans and branded German) .1 hypocrite for
bringing iis case against the United States at the
World (Court.
Arizona's attorney general, Janet Napolitano, re
minded I'.N. judges that Walter and Karl KaGrand
were executed last year for murder — hut only alter
a decade and ,» hall ol appeals in lour dillerent
com is.
" I here should be no doubt that the l.<i(Crands re
ceived a fair trial," she told the highest international
judicial tribunal. "They received all of the protections
that an American c itizen would have received."
Horn iu Augsburg, Germany, the KaGrands were
taken to the I nited States as children in the 19(i0s by
their (ierman mother and American stepfather.
()n Jan. 7, 1 982, the brothers tried to rob a bank
near Tucson and murdered the (W-year-old manag
er, stabbing him repeatecllv with a letter opener alter
he liiiled to open the safe. I hey also wounded ;i
teller.
I he attorney general reminded the IT> judges ol
"the especially c ruel, heinous and depraved nature"
ol the l.iit brands' crime and of a prior felony convic
tion fora violent offense.
She urged judges "to remember that a horrible
murder was committed simply because two men were
frustrated when tliev tried to rob a bank, and to re
member the stake society has in protecting it sell from
violent crime."
Germany lias alleged Arizona violated the broth
ers international rights because they were not told of
their right to consular assistance, and maintains that
the Ka( Crands were executed because iliev were poor
and had substandard court-appointed counsel.

But New York University human rights scholar
1 heodor Meron pointed out that foreign citizens
have been arrested in Germany without being given
consular notification. I le said Germany went so far as
to oppose the quashing of their convictions "in dras
tic contrast to the KaGrand case."
"Germany attempts to have a different standard
applied to the United States than that which it follows
in its own national practice," Meron said.
Napolitano noted that two other German brothers
are on death row in Arizona, but she said Germany
took no action to provide assistance when it was in-
Ibrmed of their arrest in 1989.
She insisted state courts had taken all evidence into
account in the I.aC'.rands' case and consular assistance
wouldn't have changed a thing.
1 lie United States has conceded the failure over
the consular notification, but Germany wants the
court to condemn the violation of the 1963 Vienna
Gouvention on Consular Relations and recognize its
right to reparations.
[ .S. lawyers yesterday asked the court to reject
both demands.
State Department legal adviser James Thessin,
suggested the case was a ruse to "litigate the death
penalty under the guise of a violation" of the Vienna
C Convention.
"We must not," he said, "allow Germany to lead us
into . . . restructuring the United States criminal jus
tice system."
Kac h side rebuts the others' arguments later this
week before the judges retire lor deliberations. No
elate has been set fora judgment. World (Court rul
ings are binding under international law. I lowev
er, the court has no independent enforcement
mechanism.
