noon deadline for the independent Baptist
congregation to vacate its property passed
without any sign of marshals.
"They can take our church. They cannot
take out convictions," the church's pastor,
the Rev. dreg A. Dixon, said from the pulpit

questioned the authority of the IRS.

gregation, stopped withholding federal in

come and Social Security taxes from the
payc hecks <>l its employees in 1984. Church
officials said th.it their duty to obey God pre
vailed over manmade laws, and that with
holding taxes would make the church an
agent of the government. The younger
Dixon said the employees have paid their
own taxes.
On Sept. 28, U.S. District Judge Sarah
Fvans ordered the- surrender of the church,
its school and parsonages to satisfy a lien of
$(> million in back taxes, penalties and inter

God will not be mocked" and "Father, have
mere y on them," followed by the names of
William Rehnquist and John Paul Stevens.

cent days had denied the Baptist I emple's
