# Israel tightens blockade
## 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel im
posed a stringent blockade around
Palestinian communities yesterday
in response to the deadly drive-by
shootings of Israelis, paraly/ing
normal lilt' but failing to halt vio
lence. At least three Palestinians
were killed in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
The killings of four Israelis on
Monday was part of a new "death
on the roads" terror campaign by
Palestinian militants, Israel said.
Palestinian leaders condemned
the army cordon around the terri
tories they control.
The Israeli army's intensified
blockade, which prevents travel
from one Palestinian community
to another on the West Bank,
keeps Palestinians oil the roads
used by the 200,000 Israeli settlers.
It also prevents any semblance ol
normal activity in Palestinian
areas. Many Palestinians are kept
from their jobs, and conducting
business and moving goods is vir
tually impossible.
The latest blockade is an addi
tion to existing measures that pre
vent Palestinians in the West Bank
and Gaza from traveling to Israel
proper. Some 120,000 Palestinians
work in Israel and account fora
large chunk of the Palestinian econ
omy, but they've been unable to
reach their jobs since a closure was
imposed more than a month ago.
The blockade came as Prime
Minister Ehud Barak headed
home from a U.S. trip that pro
duced no peace breakthroughs,

and as Israelis and Palestinians
braced lor potentially widespread
confrontations today — the 12th
anniversary of a symbolic declara
tion of Palestinian independence.
"The (Palestinian) state will be
fundamental to peace in the Mid
dle East," Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat declared upon his return to
Gaza yesterday from an Islamic
summit in Qatar.
Arafat, who was in exile when
he first declared Palestinian inde
pendence on Nov. 15, 1988, has
repeatedly promised that state
hood would arrive this year. Some
Palestinians have called lor a uni
lateral declaration today.
But with the peace process de
railed by violence, no such move is
planned, Palestinian leaders said.
Israel, meanwhile, has warned that
it would respond harshly to any
one-sided ac tion by the Palestinians.
" There will be no decision on the
Palestinian state in the coming lew
clays," said Yasser Abed Rabbo, the
Palestinian information minister.
In yesterday's violence, three
teen-agers, aged 13-19, were shot
dead by Israeli troops in the West
Bank and Gaza, hospital doctors
said. Israel, however, denied that
its soliders had killed the two
youths in Gaza, calling reports ol
the incident part of the ' < ampaign
of Palestinian lies that have in
flamed the territories."
In a fourth case, Palestinians
said a 50-year-old man died after
settlers threw rocks at his car. A
passenger in the car said the man

was liii in ilie chest by a huge rock.
Israeli police said no complaint
had been tiled, and so the\ had not
begun an investigation.
Alter seven weeks of fighting
and more than 200 dead, mosth
Palestinians, the conflict appeared
to be taking on a new dimension,
focused on the roads ol the West
Bank, where Israeli settlements
are scattered outside much larger
Palestinian cities and towns.
The number of young Palestini
ans taking part in stone-throwing
clashes each afternoon lias been de
riming. However, Palestinian am
bushes along isolated roads have
been on the rise. A pair of Israeli ve
hicles were raked with gunfire Mon
day, leaving two soldiers and two
civilians dead, and eight wounded.
It was the highest one-day death
toll for Israelis since the conflict
broke out at the end of September.
Barak canceled a I .ondon meet
ing yesterday with British Prime
Minister l ony Blair and headed
home lor an emergency meetingol
his securitv Cabinet. I 'his morn
ing's meeting will weigh responses
to Monday's killings of the Israelis.
No Palestinian group claimed
responsibility lor Monday's shoot
ing ambushes. However, Israeli
Cabinet Minister Binvamin Ben-
Eliezer, the acting prime minister
during Barak's absence, said the
gunmen apparentlv were support
ers of the militant Islamic Jihad
group. I le alleged the attacks were
carried out with the knowledge
and support of Arafat.
