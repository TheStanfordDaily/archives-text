LOS ANGELES (AP) — Major
broadcast networks have included
more blacks in their shows but oth
erwise failed to live up to agreements
earlier this year to provide more eth
nically diverse programming, a
coalition of civil rights groups said
yesterday.
The pictures at ABC, CBS, NBC
and Fox remain largely black and
white to the detriment of Asian-Amer
icans, Hispanics and Native Ameri
cans, the coalition of the NAACP and
others contend.
"There is no progress in terms of
Latino representation in the
media," Raul Yzaguirre of the Na
tional Latino Media Council told a
news conference.
The NAACP, while lauding the in
creased hiring of Marks in acting and
other behind-the-scenes jobs this
season, said the coalition remains
united in its effort to make TV trulv

inclusive.
"We don't want them (the net
works) to think hiring Afric an-.Vmeri
cans will appease the entire minority
community," said NAACP
spokeswoman Debbie Liu, adding that
there is still room for improvement for
black representation.
Karen Narasaki ol the National
Asian Pacific Americ an Legal Consor
tium offered a dismal "report card"
grading networks on their inclusion of
Asian-Americans. The highest grade
was a "D-plus" for NBC, which fea
tures a handful of ac tors such .is Ming-
Na in "ER." ( BS got an "F. AB( and
Fox both received "D-minuses."
She also blasted the networks for
missing opportunities to make the
casts of shows such "Welcome to N .Y.,"
which is set in a conspicuously multi
cultural city, more diverse.
Last winter, the coalition secured
agreements from the- four networks to

increase both l lie number of minorities
on-screen as well as development deals
with writers and producers.
I he deals were readied in January
and February after separate discus
sions between the coalition groups and
the networks. I he agreements gener
ally didn't include specific numbers
that could provide a benchmark lor
pt< >gress.
The networks opened negotiations
with civil rights groups alter the
NAA( V floated the threat ol <t TV boy
cott or legal action because ol the lack
of minority actors on the tall 1999
schedule of new shows.
Phe networks sav they are trying to
change.
"Diversity remains an important
initiative for us here at ABC," said
John Rose, who is directing the net
work's diversity ellort. "We've done a
lot and made significant progress, but
we realize more has to be done.''
