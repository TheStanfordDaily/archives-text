## The
						Stanford Daily Non-Varsity athletic facilities need improvement

Published Since IS 1 )I

You race from one creaking chunk of
metal to the next. Around you, oth
ers swarm in fierce competition for
the next available slot. White paper

bree/e of the standing fan as sweaty figures

I lus is not a scene from a s< i-fi novel; this is
life in the fishbowl, a.k.a. the Tresidder Fitness
(Center.
Stanford lias a long history of strong athlet
ics commingled with elite academics. Varsity
athletes are talented, intelligent and dedicated
to the I niversitv. But what about all of those
non-Varsitv athletes, those students who
stopped < onipcting after high school, or those
who never competed but enjoy the physical
exercise?
Three years ago, the Athletics Department
built the I ressider Fitness (Center to accomo-

date these athletes. Last year, its hours were
extended, a great benefit to late-night war
riors. But these provisions are not enough
fora body of active students. We need more
facilities with better maintainance if we be
lieve that all students, and not just varsity
athletes, should have access to quality athlet
ic facilties.
Non-Varsity athletes have several options at
Stanford. There are machines in 11 it- Ford (Cen
ter, Arrillaga is open to all students during two
large chunks of the day, the Aver)' Aquatic (Cen
ter has open swim hours, and Roble (iym has a
few athletic facilities as well. The trails to the
Dish and surrounding areas are available for
runners, and aerobics classes are offered sev
eral times weekly.
However, this setup is too diffuse and the
hours of operation too sporadic. Further, at any
given time, at least one third of the staii masters

at Tresidder are likely lo he in disrepair. ()ne fii
cility, with excellent resources and with ma
chines in working condition, would be wel
comed gratefully by the student population.
The University ol Notre Dame recently
constructed the new Rolfs Recreational Sports
facility for nonvarsity undergraduates. It
boasts a large number of machines, an ice rink,
lour basketball / volleyball courts, a track,
weights, ra(|iietball courts and even pool and
ping pong tables.
Columbia University has the Bard Athletic
Outer, which, according to the Columbia Stu
dent I landbook, includes a pool, three squash
courts, a gymnasium, an exercise room, Nau
tilus and Universal exercise equipment, dumb
bell sets and benches, stationary bicycles, rowing
machines, lockers, showers and saunas. 1 he
Center also offers extensive aerobics programs.
With the billion-dollar Campaign under

way, we urge the University to consider devot
ing a portion of its funds to the improvement
of education through the promotion of physi
cal wellness. Though it would bean ideal solu
tion, it is not absolutely necessary to build a
new edifice for recreation. Instead, we offer
some suggestions:
I)Fnlarge the Ford (lenter and make this
area the main recreational athletic facility on
campus.
2) Modernize the antiquated Roble (iym so
that the weight room is up to modern stan
dards. Add Nautilus and other machines.
3) Expand the Tresidder Fitness Center and
maintain the equipment.
The multitudes of tuition-paying, non-Var
sity students at Stanford need some improved
facilities. There is a budget; physical wellness is
a priority. Let's work something out so we can
all get out of the fishbowl.
