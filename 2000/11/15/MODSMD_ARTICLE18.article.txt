## Defending anachronism 
### 
When il comes to our bedrock
assumptions, our faith in first
principles, our deepest con
vic lions, a week can change a
whole lot of things.
Four days before Flee lion I uesday, the
I lines s (>ail (ol litis reported, " I lie (lore
campaign realh cannot say enough good
things about the Flectoral College."
" I lie Founding Fathers," (lore's press
secret an (liirped, "were men of vision."
With the House of Bush leading in
four national polls — this before George
the Younger at last remembered his lam-

ily's stately aversion to
campaigning — the
vice president seemed
destined to finish sec
ond. In most places
1 his would spell defeat,
onlv America's not like
most places. Fven if the

lis the Klecloral (lollege, si lipid!
111 a tribute to their prescience, the poll
sters got everything right, except that it's
the other wav around. As it stands now,
Bush is poised to trump (lore's plurality
with .1 majoritv in the Klectoral College.
Still, the \ i< e president could pull ahead iu
Florida, which would give him Klectoral
College superiority; with a million absen
tee ballots unlallied in Caliiornia alone,
Bush might yei < lose the gap in the popu
l,n vole. I he Kle( toral (lollege giveih, and
the Klecloral (College taketh away.
I wo things, however, are certain: This
nation will have a 43rd president, chosen
bv the Klectoral (College, and the support
ers of whomever isn't chosen by the Klec
loral College will say mean and nasty
things about the svstem.
Whatever its imperfections, the Elec
toral C ollege is one of the least harmful in
stitutions in America. It protects voting mi
norities, impressing upon the minds of
wannabe world leaders a sense of the local.
Supporters of direct elections argue
that the popular vote guarantees an equal
value to ea< h ballot, a claim that is neither
true nor desirable. In direct elections one
candidate takes everythin.All the support
the losing c andidates may have garnered is
rendered worthless. Kven though Bill
Clinton and Bob Dole split thel99b elec
tion 49 t042 percent, I)c»le did not serve for
42 percent of the subsequent presidential
term. Giving value to each vote in such a
wav would be philosophically fairer than

the current system but tunc tionalK insane.
Unless, ol course, you were able to book
your vacation in advance for the weekend
in February 2003 when the Natural Law
Party gets its crack at the White House.
I lie Flectoral College is preferable to
the popular vote in lite same wa\ the
World Series is preferable to the Super
Howl. ()ne decides the champion based on
a medley of local contests, each one
unique, idiosyncratic and potentially re
plete with drama. 1 lie other puts all the
marbles 011 a single match, requiring ol us
participants function rather than nuance,
administration rather than strategy,
Bauhaus consensus rather than baroque
<< lalition.
Imagine, for example, an ethnic com
munity comprising 10 percent of the pop
ulation of ,1 single mid-sized city. Were
each vote, regardless of its origin, consid
ered equal, there would be 110 pragmatic
reason fora candidate to reach out to this
community. In the World Series Flectoral
System, on the other hand, such a commu
nity might provide a candidate with the
majority he needs to win ,1 particular slate
— prompting him to deal its leaders into
his alliance.
I he popular vote would contribute, as a
former solicitor general recently argued,
"to a further Starbucks-ification of our po
litic; tl life." The candidates would no
longer need to shuttle across the country
trying on diflerent accents wherever they
landed. Most likely, the race would be set
tled in five or so major cities or in three
major television studios.
Ihe Electoral System has functioned
commendably in its 200 years. It should
not be scrapped, no matter what the polit
ical alligators, Republican or Democratic,
run into this week in the
Fvet glades.

candidate has never won.
