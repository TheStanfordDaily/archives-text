Mclfugh met with University
President John Hennessy and ex
pect "a solution" to the disagree
ments over Stanford's permit by
Nov. 27, when the supervisors are
scheduled to deliver a final verdict
over the University's development
plans.
I lie controversial Daily News
headline came a day alter the
paper reported on the Stanford
()pen Space Alliance's allegation

that a 1987 study commissioned by
Stanford shows that the I niversitv
has considered developing the
Foothills. The 13-year-old docu
ment shows paved roads and other
structures in the Dish area.
A statement published by the
University c alls S( )SA's press re
lease "inaccurate and deceptive,"
and says th.it the l'.)N7 plan "had
no official standing within the
University" and was never adopt
ed as a planning document.
At yesterday's hearing, the su
pervisors voted to delay public dis
cussion over the Stanford plan to

Nov. 27.
"At that time, if we haven't
loimd common ground with the
applicant, then I'll . . . arrange
pre>posals for consideration by col
leagues iit that time," Simitian
said.
Simitian represents District 5,
which contains Stanford's 1,017
acres of unincorporated Santa
Clara County land. He has pro
posed a compromise expansion
plan tli.it would require Stanford
in leave half of the 2,200-acre
Foothills undeveloped for the next
century in exchange for permis

sion to build 47 acres of academic
facilities.
St an lord has called Simitian's
plan "unacceptable," while groups
who pushed for permanent
preservation of the entire
Foothills, such as the city of Palo
Alto and the Committee for Creen
Foothills, say the plan does not go
far enough.
The Daily News suggested in its
article yesterday that Simitian's re
cent election to the Slate Assembly
might reduce his authority on the
board, because he will be stepping
down in December.
