Daily mislabeled Objectivist article
Monday, Nov. 13, I'he Daily published a
guest column I wrote with the headline,
"Feel gt>otl gelling rich; greed is 1 he highest
moral virtue." And it was followed by an at
line that read "I le [myself] stands lor Rea
son. Fgoism, and Cireed." I hese are terri
ble misrepresentations and must be
cot ret ted.
Let me stale dearly that I did not write
my letter to defend greed, 1 wrote it to de
fend egoism, (ireed is a deliberately mis
leading concept tli.it "package deals" to
gether two disparate and incompatible
ideas: selfishness and the desire for the
undeserved.
I was careful in my column to defend
the moral right of the productive, those
who have earned their values, to what they
have earned and to praise them fort lie de
sire to achieve material luxury and
happiness.
I hat is not greed, at least in the sense
that altruists use the word. I o an altruist,
one who advocates self-sacrifice, there is no
difference between a businessman's desire
fora new car he will buy with his own
money and a robber's desire for your wal
let; both, says the altruist, are greed.
Rational egoism, however, upholds the
notion that it is moral to uphold your own
interests and th.it your life is your ultimate
value. However, it rejects the notion that
the unearned will actually benefit you. A
central tenet of egoism is that every man's
life is an end in itself.
Therefore, no one should sacrifice him

self to another nor another to himself. In
fact, it is irrational and unselfish to try to
procure unearned values through forte
and fraud; it ret luces a human being to a
parasite who is utterly dependent 011
others.
It is clear, then, why 1 would never claim
that greet 1 is the highest moral virtue. Ra
tionality is the only fundamental virtue,
and productivity is its most important ex
pression because the production of values
is necessary lor maintaining one's life.
Secondly, the at-line I wrote staled
that I stand for: reason, egoism, and cap
italism. Capitalism is the political system
that bans the initiation of physical force
and defends the rights of men. The free
dom in regards to thought and action
that it affords humanity are essential pre
requisites for human life. If you are not
free to think you will have nothing to pro
duce; if you are not free to produce you
will stai*ve.
Finally, I would never defend produc
tivity and egoism on the grounds that they
"feel good."Though the freedom from the
unearned guilt of altruism and the self-es
teem and happiness that come from pro
ducing values tit) feel wonderful, their jus
tification is not a hedonistic one. They are
not morally or psychologically equivalent
to a junkie's high.
Getting rich is moral — if the wealth is
earned properly — because material val
ues are prerequisites of human life, and I
hold that human life is the only logical stan
dard by which to judge values. In other
words, values are objectively gtn>d or bad.

They are anything but subjective, which is
what The Daily's headline implied.

Stanford letter to Alumni uninformative
I was somewhat surprised and disturbed
to get two e-mail messages from Stan lord
University urging me to lobby on behalf ol
Stanford expansion.
As a Stanford employee and alumnus, I
have an interest in Stanford and its aca
demic mission. As a resident of Santa ( lat a
County, I also have an interest in ensuring
that the (lounty is a viable and livable com
munity. And, as a human being, I have an
interest in creating a society th.it meets the
needs of .ill people here and elsewhere.
Ihe Stanford message urged me to
lobby for expansion without providing any
information on why Stanford needs to ex
pand. Since I was a student 1972-77, the
sizeof the academic campus has grown sub
stantially. Ihe Stanford Shopping Center
and Stanford Industrial Park have also
both grown substantially, greatly increasing
traffic and exacerbating the housing short
age. Ihe last 10 years have been a period of
constant building and expansion, and this
part of the Peninsula is becoming unlivahle.
Ihe plan for expansion over the next 10
years calls for even more growth.
