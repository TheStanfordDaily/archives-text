Daily mislabeled Objectivist article
Monday, Nov. 13, I'he Daily published a
guest column I wrote with the headline,
"Feel gt>otl gelling rich; greed is 1 he highest
moral virtue." And it was followed by an at
line that read "I le [myself] stands lor Rea
son. Fgoism, and Cireed." I hese are terri
ble misrepresentations and must be
cot ret ted.
Let me stale dearly that I did not write
my letter to defend greed, 1 wrote it to de
fend egoism, (ireed is a deliberately mis
leading concept tli.it "package deals" to
gether two disparate and incompatible
ideas: selfishness and the desire for the
undeserved.
I was careful in my column to defend
the moral right of the productive, those
who have earned their values, to what they
have earned and to praise them fort lie de
sire to achieve material luxury and
happiness.
I hat is not greed, at least in the sense
that altruists use the word. I o an altruist,
one who advocates self-sacrifice, there is no
difference between a businessman's desire
fora new car he will buy with his own
money and a robber's desire for your wal
let; both, says the altruist, are greed.
Rational egoism, however, upholds the
notion that it is moral to uphold your own
interests and th.it your life is your ultimate
value. However, it rejects the notion that
the unearned will actually benefit you. A
central tenet of egoism is that every man's
life is an end in itself.
Therefore, no one should sacrifice him

self to another nor another to himself. In
fact, it is irrational and unselfish to try to
procure unearned values through forte
and fraud; it ret luces a human being to a
parasite who is utterly dependent 011
others.
It is clear, then, why 1 would never claim
that greet 1 is the highest moral virtue. Ra
tionality is the only fundamental virtue,
and productivity is its most important ex
pression because the production of values
is necessary lor maintaining one's life.
Secondly, the at-line I wrote staled
that I stand for: reason, egoism, and cap
italism. Capitalism is the political system
that bans the initiation of physical force
and defends the rights of men. The free
dom in regards to thought and action
that it affords humanity are essential pre
requisites for human life. If you are not
free to think you will have nothing to pro
duce; if you are not free to produce you
will stai*ve.
Finally, I would never defend produc
tivity and egoism on the grounds that they
"feel good."Though the freedom from the
unearned guilt of altruism and the self-es
teem and happiness that come from pro
ducing values tit) feel wonderful, their jus
tification is not a hedonistic one. They are
not morally or psychologically equivalent
to a junkie's high.
Getting rich is moral — if the wealth is
earned properly — because material val
ues are prerequisites of human life, and I
hold that human life is the only logical stan
dard by which to judge values. In other
words, values are objectively gtn>d or bad.

They are anything but subjective, which is
what The Daily's headline implied.

Stanford letter to Alumni uninformative
I was somewhat surprised and disturbed
to get two e-mail messages from Stan lord
University urging me to lobby on behalf ol
Stanford expansion.
As a Stanford employee and alumnus, I
have an interest in Stanford and its aca
demic mission. As a resident of Santa ( lat a
County, I also have an interest in ensuring
that the (lounty is a viable and livable com
munity. And, as a human being, I have an
interest in creating a society th.it meets the
needs of .ill people here and elsewhere.
Ihe Stanford message urged me to
lobby for expansion without providing any
information on why Stanford needs to ex
pand. Since I was a student 1972-77, the
sizeof the academic campus has grown sub
stantially. Ihe Stanford Shopping Center
and Stanford Industrial Park have also
both grown substantially, greatly increasing
traffic and exacerbating the housing short
age. Ihe last 10 years have been a period of
constant building and expansion, and this
part of the Peninsula is becoming unlivahle.
Ihe plan for expansion over the next 10
years calls for even more growth.
II Stanford believes thai growth is valu
able, then listing the benefits and showing
that they are more valuable than their cost
should easily convince the (lounty Supervi
sors to approve expansion.
II the benefits are not so obvious, then
perhaps there should be a moratorium on
construction until the benefits are more
obvious.

Thank you for disabusing me of
my social ideals
As a Stanford student on the outskirts of
the techie community to whom |ason
Rheins directed his column of Nov. 13
("Feel good getting rich; greed is the high
est moral virtue,") I would like to thank
Jason for helping me make a better-in
formed decision about my career path.
I would like to thank him most lor re
minding me once again that students who
are "passionately, selfishly devoted to the
ideal ol achieving excellence in their chosen
field" should feel no remorse if their chosen
field happens to be enormously lucrative.
Instead, they should remember that their
good fortune lies in being born with a pre
disposition towards a professional life
which leads them, In the most direct path,
to personal wealth.
Indeed, even if their disposition leads
i hc*m instead towards the possibility of the
advancement of human knowledge or the
promotion of the equality of all people, they
should leel no hesitation in forsaking this
pursuit in favor of a profession which allows
greater possibility for excellence — espe
cial!) excellence which results in material
gain and, hem e, happiness.
I le deserves praise, as well, for convinc
ing me conclusively that I and other
prospective Wall Street employees among
the student body have nothing to worry

about. How could I have thought that there
could In* any other moral ideal than to ma
nipulate wealth resulting from t lie exploita
tion of natural resources and developing
countries for my own personal gain?
I had, for several years, perhaps under
the pernicious influence of the new-New
Left, believed that it was valuable to con
tribute to the good of people less fortunate
than I. Luckily, 1 have been disabused ol
that notion.
On the hard road ahead — job inter
views, years working my wax up the corpo
rate ladder and, ultimately, a life as one ol
the moneyed elite — there will be inanx
times, 1 am sure, in which I will need reas
surance that 1 am truly capable and that mx
status is due purely to my own ellort. It is in
those times that I will remember with fond
regret my friends in third-world countries
who are far less competent and have
worked less diligently than I.
I wish that they were here with me at
Stanford, but I know that it is their own in
dolence and incompetence which has
kept them from entrance into this presti
gious institution. Faced \\ it I i this prepon
derance of evidence, who could question
th.it, in this world, we all start out in the
same place?
As part of an upper-middle c lass family
in New York City, 1 fiaveclearlx had just the
same chances for material wealth and hap
piness as have citizens of countries with to
talitarian governments, liiiling economies
or complete religious repression.
My last congratulations to Jason are
given to him for helping me jettison the lel't
ist idealism which is so pernicious on Stan
ford's campus — especially throughout the
dangerously large ac tivist segment ol om
student body. Without the help of brave
people like him, 1 feel that I might have
been in grave danger of succumbing to the
possibility of wreaking social change.

Expansion is spinning out of control
Stanford's expansionist dreams art

c louding its vision of tomorrow.
As an eight-year resident of Stanford's
iaculty housing and a current Palo Alto
homeowner, I am astonished to see the
sheet volume ofoHice space Ix'ing added to
the campus.
Of course, there will be consequential
demands lor mote housing as those offices
lill up. Inevitably, this will lead to the need
for mote schools, restaurants and retail
businesses. I his, in clue course, will lead to
increased demand lor "laborers."
Never lear. Call in the maids, landsca
pers, construction crews, teac hers, waiters,
salesc lerks, janitors, peace oilicers, nurses,
sec retaries and daycare providers. The list
goes on. I here's only one problem.
Silicon Yallcv has grown too big lor its
britches.
I wonder if those you house will find a
maid to make their houses sparkle. 1 .anclsca
pers are going to be busy trimming lawns in
(iilt oy. ('.oustruction crews lor the pre)posed
housing tracts in the Stanford Foothills will
Ik- living in aflbrdable housing they built in
(lescent (lily. I eat hers will be leaching little
ones in I lollislei. Waiters will be cleaning up
after gracious diners in Yreka.
Salesclerks will be checking purchases at
the outlet mall in Redding. Janitors might
be willing to clean up alter school lunches if
the district is willing to haul ii to their la< ili
ties in Red Blttll. Am bad guys you want
rounded up will have to have done their
dirt\ deeds in (lliico if they want to get
caught.
Kids will never have to complain about
getting shots from Nurse Ran bet unless
they move to Alturas. No one will ever get
caught chasing the secretary around the
desk unless she opens a biotech franchise
in Kl (lent to. l.iitle angels will be monitored
by closed-circuit television from the nanny's
place in Needles.
One wax or another, the dream of the
good life lile will be reali/ed, I'm just sure of
it.
I'lie nightmare of congestion will be
over. Jaguars, Mercedes, BMWs, Volvos,
Audis .ind Porsches will transport Stanlor
dians to their necessary destinations. I ligh
ways won't be congested by anyone except
the intellectual elite and their business

counterparts.
All c hiefs; no Indians. 1 mean: (lards. I
mean: frees.
()r maybe, here's a thought. Perhaps nis
time to take a breath, smell the Foothills
Leave them alone so we all can come home.
Stop the ollice-making. Stop the Foothills
encroachment plans. Dream smaller
dreams. We'll all sleep better at night.

Recent Daily items offer
unreasonable "wisdom"
Since the reversal of last week's political
dilemma from "either/or to "neither
not ," there has been mounted an anxious
offensive in I he Daily's pages against hu
manitarian values that only the right-sight
ed can si ill see as left-winged.
If it "ouches," it hurts, used to sa\ m\
gramma. I lend to trust her wisdom.
1 have read at least two columns or letters
and an <id in the last four issues supporting
this view. Ii is impossible to know ifthcir writ
ers acted in concert. P»nt, the jovful fatalist I
am. 1 will gladly suppose so. Indeed, I have
no doubt they all would blow their hist breath
to inllate the same platform, the one de
signed toaccommc >datea single ineli\idttal at
the expense of countless others.
To give a few examples: I read that
making money is a virtue. This smells like
an invitation to fraud. For, as far .is I
know, only the federal Reserve can
"make" money; the rest of ns simph ex
change it. If statements like this stand for
()bjectivisni, I'd rather let the police han
dle the matter.
I also read that the presidential candi
date for the (ii ecu Party is a cr\ pto-Mat xist
— why not the incarnation of Marx him
self?— and I thought n strange that he has
lot so long remained at large: probably "be
cause this is Amei ica. As an aside, I also fell
stupid not to have recognized safety-belts
lor what they really are, an ingenious em
blem of communist infiltration, trapping
the hard-working American driver into the

supers! rue lure of (he vehicle and impeding
free-market laws to work in a crash.
I also realized that lor some Stanford stu
dents American voters are the lawful prop
em ol onh two parties, evidently a remark
able improvement from the one-party sys
tem ol Cuba. Iking squeezed between an
elephant and an ass descriljes eloquently
the essence of the American dream.
And 1 read again about the torture ola
new generation ol sell-interest martyrs who
cannot exercize their natural, it appears,
i ol emptying other peoples pockets
and plundering the natural resources ol
other nations — because, don't Ibrget, "this
is America." Courage! The first one hun
dred veai s are alvvavs difficult.
And.finally. I was truly s,id that lellow
students, who believe themselves entitled
to screw the universe jnst because they
made it to Stanford, are obliged to reverse
their own values. For 1 would expect the
champions of self-interest and personal
advancement to spend the List ounce ol
thcil energ\ making money, not getting
out to the public and seeking attention lor
their ideology.
Hut the\ need an audience to hear their
complaints; tliev need backers to lend them
money; tlie\ need customers to give them
precious dollars or accolades. 1 he iron man
lie of crude individualism, the most ludi
crous ideological construction ever, has to
melt.
II thev are ()bjectivist, let them read first
the I.V reports that describe a hellish
image of injustice and inequality in most
parts <>! the world, this country included,
and then the paid scientific reports of think
tankers. And, il thev advocate self-interest
.is a virtue and find service .111 evil, let them
not bother usollering free-to-all ideological
custard.
In all eai nestess, I wish them humanity
and humbleness. Because as long as "this is
Americ a" tiiev will need us, not as bodies to
step on but as lellow citizens, brothers and
sisters, friends and colleagues. For it has al
\va\ sheen and it will always be that way with
real human beings. Amen.

Stanford letter to Alumni uninformative
I was somewhat surprised and disturbed
to get two e-mail messages from Stan lord
University urging me to lobby on behalf ol
Stanford expansion.
As a Stanford employee and alumnus, I
have an interest in Stanford and its aca
demic mission. As a resident of Santa ( lat a
County, I also have an interest in ensuring
that the (lounty is a viable and livable com
munity. And, as a human being, I have an
interest in creating a society th.it meets the
needs of .ill people here and elsewhere.
Ihe Stanford message urged me to
lobby for expansion without providing any
information on why Stanford needs to ex
pand. Since I was a student 1972-77, the
sizeof the academic campus has grown sub
stantially. Ihe Stanford Shopping Center
and Stanford Industrial Park have also
both grown substantially, greatly increasing
traffic and exacerbating the housing short
age. Ihe last 10 years have been a period of
constant building and expansion, and this
part of the Peninsula is becoming unlivahle.
Ihe plan for expansion over the next 10
years calls for even more growth.
II Stanford believes thai growth is valu
able, then listing the benefits and showing
that they are more valuable than their cost
should easily convince the (lounty Supervi
sors to approve expansion.
II the benefits are not so obvious, then
perhaps there should be a moratorium on
construction until the benefits are more
obvious.

Thank you for disabusing me of
my social ideals
As a Stanford student on the outskirts of
the techie community to whom |ason
Rheins directed his column of Nov. 13
("Feel good getting rich; greed is the high
est moral virtue,") I would like to thank
Jason for helping me make a better-in
formed decision about my career path.
I would like to thank him most lor re
minding me once again that students who
are "passionately, selfishly devoted to the
ideal ol achieving excellence in their chosen
field" should feel no remorse if their chosen
field happens to be enormously lucrative.
Instead, they should remember that their
good fortune lies in being born with a pre
disposition towards a professional life
which leads them, In the most direct path,
to personal wealth.
Indeed, even if their disposition leads
i hc*m instead towards the possibility of the
advancement of human knowledge or the
promotion of the equality of all people, they
should leel no hesitation in forsaking this
pursuit in favor of a profession which allows
greater possibility for excellence — espe
cial!) excellence which results in material
gain and, hem e, happiness.
I le deserves praise, as well, for convinc
ing me conclusively that I and other
prospective Wall Street employees among
the student body have nothing to worry

about. How could I have thought that there
could In* any other moral ideal than to ma
nipulate wealth resulting from t lie exploita
tion of natural resources and developing
countries for my own personal gain?
I had, for several years, perhaps under
the pernicious influence of the new-New
Left, believed that it was valuable to con
tribute to the good of people less fortunate
than I. Luckily, 1 have been disabused ol
that notion.
On the hard road ahead — job inter
views, years working my wax up the corpo
rate ladder and, ultimately, a life as one ol
the moneyed elite — there will be inanx
times, 1 am sure, in which I will need reas
surance that 1 am truly capable and that mx
status is due purely to my own ellort. It is in
those times that I will remember with fond
regret my friends in third-world countries
who are far less competent and have
worked less diligently than I.
I wish that they were here with me at
Stanford, but I know that it is their own in
dolence and incompetence which has
kept them from entrance into this presti
gious institution. Faced \\ it I i this prepon
derance of evidence, who could question
th.it, in this world, we all start out in the
same place?
As part of an upper-middle c lass family
in New York City, 1 fiaveclearlx had just the
same chances for material wealth and hap
piness as have citizens of countries with to
talitarian governments, liiiling economies
or complete religious repression.
My last congratulations to Jason are
given to him for helping me jettison the lel't
ist idealism which is so pernicious on Stan
ford's campus — especially throughout the
dangerously large ac tivist segment ol om
student body. Without the help of brave
people like him, 1 feel that I might have
been in grave danger of succumbing to the
possibility of wreaking social change.

As an eight-year resident of Stanford's

the campus.
Of course, there will be consequential
demands lor mote housing as those offices
lill up. Inevitably, this will lead to the need
for mote schools, restaurants and retail

increased demand lor "laborers."
Never lear. Call in the maids, landsca

salesc lerks, janitors, peace oilicers, nurses,
sec retaries and daycare providers. The list
goes on. I here's only one problem.
Silicon Yallcv has grown too big lor its

I wonder if those you house will find a

Salesclerks will be checking purchases at
the outlet mall in Redding. Janitors might

the district is willing to haul ii to their la< ili

rounded up will have to have done their
dirt\ deeds in (lliico if they want to get

Kids will never have to complain about
getting shots from Nurse Ran bet unless
they move to Alturas. No one will ever get
caught chasing the secretary around the

by closed-circuit television from the nanny's

One wax or another, the dream of the

Recent Daily items offer
unreasonable "wisdom"
Since the reversal of last week's political
dilemma from "either/or to "neither
not ," there has been mounted an anxious
offensive in I he Daily's pages against hu
manitarian values that only the right-sight
ed can si ill see as left-winged.
If it "ouches," it hurts, used to sa\ m\

1 have read at least two columns or letters
and an <id in the last four issues supporting
this view. Ii is impossible to know ifthcir writ
ers acted in concert. P»nt, the jovful fatalist I
am. 1 will gladly suppose so. Indeed, I have
no doubt they all would blow their hist breath
to inllate the same platform, the one de
signed toaccommc >datea single ineli\idttal at
the expense of countless others.
To give a few examples: I read that
making money is a virtue. This smells like
an invitation to fraud. For, as far .is I
know, only the federal Reserve can
"make" money; the rest of ns simph ex
change it. If statements like this stand for
()bjectivisni, I'd rather let the police han
dle the matter.
I also read that the presidential candi
date for the (ii ecu Party is a cr\ pto-Mat xist
— why not the incarnation of Marx him
self?— and I thought n strange that he has
lot so long remained at large: probably "be
cause this is Amei ica. As an aside, I also fell
stupid not to have recognized safety-belts
lor what they really are, an ingenious em
blem of communist infiltration, trapping
the hard-working American driver into the

supers! rue lure of (he vehicle and impeding
free-market laws to work in a crash.
I also realized that lor some Stanford stu
dents American voters are the lawful prop
em ol onh two parties, evidently a remark
able improvement from the one-party sys
tem ol Cuba. Iking squeezed between an
elephant and an ass descriljes eloquently
the essence of the American dream.
And 1 read again about the torture ola
new generation ol sell-interest martyrs who
cannot exercize their natural, it appears,
i ol emptying other peoples pockets
and plundering the natural resources ol
other nations — because, don't Ibrget, "this
is America." Courage! The first one hun
dred veai s are alvvavs difficult.
And.finally. I was truly s,id that lellow
students, who believe themselves entitled
to screw the universe jnst because they
made it to Stanford, are obliged to reverse
their own values. For 1 would expect the
champions of self-interest and personal
advancement to spend the List ounce ol
thcil energ\ making money, not getting
out to the public and seeking attention lor
their ideology.
Hut the\ need an audience to hear their
complaints; tliev need backers to lend them
money; tlie\ need customers to give them
precious dollars or accolades. 1 he iron man

crous ideological construction ever, has to
melt.
II thev are ()bjectivist, let them read first

In all eai nestess, I wish them humanity
and humbleness. Because as long as "this is

Daily mislabeled Objectivist article
Monday, Nov. 13, I'he Daily published a
guest column I wrote with the headline,
"Feel gt>otl gelling rich; greed is 1 he highest
moral virtue." And it was followed by an at
line that read "I le [myself] stands lor Rea
son. Fgoism, and Cireed." I hese are terri
ble misrepresentations and must be
cot ret ted.
Let me stale dearly that I did not write
my letter to defend greed, 1 wrote it to de
fend egoism, (ireed is a deliberately mis
leading concept tli.it "package deals" to
gether two disparate and incompatible
ideas: selfishness and the desire for the
undeserved.
I was careful in my column to defend
the moral right of the productive, those
who have earned their values, to what they
have earned and to praise them fort lie de
sire to achieve material luxury and
happiness.
I hat is not greed, at least in the sense
that altruists use the word. I o an altruist,
one who advocates self-sacrifice, there is no
difference between a businessman's desire
fora new car he will buy with his own
money and a robber's desire for your wal
let; both, says the altruist, are greed.
Rational egoism, however, upholds the
notion that it is moral to uphold your own
interests and th.it your life is your ultimate
value. However, it rejects the notion that
the unearned will actually benefit you. A
central tenet of egoism is that every man's
life is an end in itself.
Therefore, no one should sacrifice him

self to another nor another to himself. In
fact, it is irrational and unselfish to try to
procure unearned values through forte
and fraud; it ret luces a human being to a
parasite who is utterly dependent 011
others.
It is clear, then, why 1 would never claim
that greet 1 is the highest moral virtue. Ra

Stanford letter to Alumni uninformative
I was somewhat surprised and disturbed
to get two e-mail messages from Stan lord
University urging me to lobby on behalf ol
Stanford expansion.
As a Stanford employee and alumnus, I
have an interest in Stanford and its aca
demic mission. As a resident of Santa ( lat a
County, I also have an interest in ensuring
that the (lounty is a viable and livable com
munity. And, as a human being, I have an
interest in creating a society th.it meets the
needs of .ill people here and elsewhere.
Ihe Stanford message urged me to
lobby for expansion without providing any
information on why Stanford needs to ex
pand. Since I was a student 1972-77, the
sizeof the academic campus has grown sub
stantially. Ihe Stanford Shopping Center
and Stanford Industrial Park have also
both grown substantially, greatly increasing
traffic and exacerbating the housing short
age. Ihe last 10 years have been a period of
constant building and expansion, and this
part of the Peninsula is becoming unlivahle.
Ihe plan for expansion over the next 10
years calls for even more growth.
II Stanford believes thai growth is valu
able, then listing the benefits and showing
that they are more valuable than their cost
should easily convince the (lounty Supervi
sors to approve expansion.
II the benefits are not so obvious, then
perhaps there should be a moratorium on
construction until the benefits are more
obvious.

Thank you for disabusing me of
my social ideals
As a Stanford student on the outskirts of
the techie community to whom |ason
Rheins directed his column of Nov. 13
("Feel good getting rich; greed is the high
est moral virtue,") I would like to thank
Jason for helping me make a better-in
formed decision about my career path.
I would like to thank him most lor re
minding me once again that students who
are "passionately, selfishly devoted to the
ideal ol achieving excellence in their chosen
field" should feel no remorse if their chosen
field happens to be enormously lucrative.
Instead, they should remember that their
good fortune lies in being born with a pre
disposition towards a professional life
which leads them, In the most direct path,
to personal wealth.
Indeed, even if their disposition leads
i hc*m instead towards the possibility of the
advancement of human knowledge or the
promotion of the equality of all people, they
should leel no hesitation in forsaking this
pursuit in favor of a profession which allows
greater possibility for excellence — espe
cial!) excellence which results in material
gain and, hem e, happiness.
I le deserves praise, as well, for convinc
ing me conclusively that I and other
prospective Wall Street employees among
the student body have nothing to worry

about. How could I have thought that there
could In* any other moral ideal than to ma
nipulate wealth resulting from t lie exploita
tion of natural resources and developing
countries for my own personal gain?
I had, for several years, perhaps under
the pernicious influence of the new-New
Left, believed that it was valuable to con
tribute to the good of people less fortunate
than I. Luckily, 1 have been disabused ol
that notion.
On the hard road ahead — job inter
views, years working my wax up the corpo
rate ladder and, ultimately, a life as one ol
the moneyed elite — there will be inanx
times, 1 am sure, in which I will need reas
surance that 1 am truly capable and that mx
status is due purely to my own ellort. It is in
those times that I will remember with fond
regret my friends in third-world countries
who are far less competent and have
worked less diligently than I.
I wish that they were here with me at
Stanford, but I know that it is their own in
dolence and incompetence which has
kept them from entrance into this presti
gious institution. Faced \\ it I i this prepon
derance of evidence, who could question
th.it, in this world, we all start out in the
same place?
As part of an upper-middle c lass family
in New York City, 1 fiaveclearlx had just the
same chances for material wealth and hap
piness as have citizens of countries with to
talitarian governments, liiiling economies
or complete religious repression.
My last congratulations to Jason are
given to him for helping me jettison the lel't
ist idealism which is so pernicious on Stan
ford's campus — especially throughout the
dangerously large ac tivist segment ol om
student body. Without the help of brave
people like him, 1 feel that I might have
been in grave danger of succumbing to the
possibility of wreaking social change.

As an eight-year resident of Stanford's

Of course, there will be consequential
demands lor mote housing as those offices
lill up. Inevitably, this will lead to the need
for mote schools, restaurants and retail

increased demand lor "laborers."

salesc lerks, janitors, peace oilicers, nurses,
sec retaries and daycare providers. The list
goes on. I here's only one problem.

I wonder if those you house will find a

Salesclerks will be checking purchases at
the outlet mall in Redding. Janitors might

the district is willing to haul ii to their la< ili

rounded up will have to have done their
dirt\ deeds in (lliico if they want to get

Kids will never have to complain about

they move to Alturas. No one will ever get
caught chasing the secretary around the

One wax or another, the dream of the

Recent Daily items offer
unreasonable "wisdom"
Since the reversal of last week's political
dilemma from "either/or to "neither
not ," there has been mounted an anxious
offensive in I he Daily's pages against hu
manitarian values that only the right-sight
ed can si ill see as left-winged.
If it "ouches," it hurts, used to sa\ m\
gramma. I lend to trust her wisdom.
1 have read at least two columns or letters
and an <id in the last four issues supporting
this view. Ii is impossible to know ifthcir writ
ers acted in concert. P»nt, the jovful fatalist I
am. 1 will gladly suppose so. Indeed, I have
no doubt they all would blow their hist breath
to inllate the same platform, the one de
signed toaccommc >datea single ineli\idttal at
the expense of countless others.
To give a few examples: I read that
making money is a virtue. This smells like
an invitation to fraud. For, as far .is I
know, only the federal Reserve can
"make" money; the rest of ns simph ex
change it. If statements like this stand for
()bjectivisni, I'd rather let the police han
dle the matter.
I also read that the presidential candi
date for the (ii ecu Party is a cr\ pto-Mat xist
— why not the incarnation of Marx him
self?— and I thought n strange that he has
lot so long remained at large: probably "be
cause this is Amei ica. As an aside, I also fell
stupid not to have recognized safety-belts
lor what they really are, an ingenious em
blem of communist infiltration, trapping
the hard-working American driver into the

supers! rue lure of (he vehicle and impeding
free-market laws to work in a crash.
I also realized that lor some Stanford stu
dents American voters are the lawful prop
em ol onh two parties, evidently a remark
able improvement from the one-party sys
tem ol Cuba. Iking squeezed between an
elephant and an ass descriljes eloquently
the essence of the American dream.
And 1 read again about the torture ola
new generation ol sell-interest martyrs who
cannot exercize their natural, it appears,
i ol emptying other peoples pockets
and plundering the natural resources ol
other nations — because, don't Ibrget, "this
is America." Courage! The first one hun
dred veai s are alvvavs difficult.
And.finally. I was truly s,id that lellow
students, who believe themselves entitled
to screw the universe jnst because they
made it to Stanford, are obliged to reverse
their own values. For 1 would expect the
champions of self-interest and personal
advancement to spend the List ounce ol
thcil energ\ making money, not getting
out to the public and seeking attention lor
their ideology.
Hut the\ need an audience to hear their
complaints; tliev need backers to lend them
money; tlie\ need customers to give them
precious dollars or accolades. 1 he iron man
lie of crude individualism, the most ludi
crous ideological construction ever, has to
melt.
II thev are ()bjectivist, let them read first
the I.V reports that describe a hellish
image of injustice and inequality in most
parts <>! the world, this country included,
and then the paid scientific reports of think
tankers. And, il thev advocate self-interest
.is a virtue and find service .111 evil, let them
not bother usollering free-to-all ideological
custard.
In all eai nestess, I wish them humanity
and humbleness. Because as long as "this is
Americ a" tiiev will need us, not as bodies to
step on but as lellow citizens, brothers and
sisters, friends and colleagues. For it has al
\va\ sheen and it will always be that way with
real human beings. Amen.

Daily mislabeled Objectivist article
Monday, Nov. 13, I'he Daily published a
guest column I wrote with the headline,
"Feel gt>otl gelling rich; greed is 1 he highest
moral virtue." And it was followed by an at
line that read "I le [myself] stands lor Rea
son. Fgoism, and Cireed." I hese are terri
ble misrepresentations and must be
cot ret ted.
Let me stale dearly that I did not write
my letter to defend greed, 1 wrote it to de
fend egoism, (ireed is a deliberately mis
leading concept tli.it "package deals" to
gether two disparate and incompatible
ideas: selfishness and the desire for the
undeserved.
I was careful in my column to defend
the moral right of the productive, those
who have earned their values, to what they
have earned and to praise them fort lie de
sire to achieve material luxury and
happiness.
I hat is not greed, at least in the sense
that altruists use the word. I o an altruist,
one who advocates self-sacrifice, there is no
difference between a businessman's desire
fora new car he will buy with his own
money and a robber's desire for your wal
let; both, says the altruist, are greed.
Rational egoism, however, upholds the
notion that it is moral to uphold your own
interests and th.it your life is your ultimate
value. However, it rejects the notion that
the unearned will actually benefit you. A
central tenet of egoism is that every man's
life is an end in itself.
Therefore, no one should sacrifice him

self to another nor another to himself. In
fact, it is irrational and unselfish to try to
procure unearned values through forte
and fraud; it ret luces a human being to a
parasite who is utterly dependent 011
others.
It is clear, then, why 1 would never claim
that greet 1 is the highest moral virtue. Ra
tionality is the only fundamental virtue,
and productivity is its most important ex
pression because the production of values
is necessary lor maintaining one's life.
Secondly, the at-line I wrote staled
that I stand for: reason, egoism, and cap
italism. Capitalism is the political system
that bans the initiation of physical force
and defends the rights of men. The free
dom in regards to thought and action
that it affords humanity are essential pre
requisites for human life. If you are not
free to think you will have nothing to pro
duce; if you are not free to produce you
will stai*ve.
Finally, I would never defend produc
tivity and egoism on the grounds that they
"feel good."Though the freedom from the
unearned guilt of altruism and the self-es
teem and happiness that come from pro
ducing values tit) feel wonderful, their jus
tification is not a hedonistic one. They are
not morally or psychologically equivalent
to a junkie's high.
Getting rich is moral — if the wealth is
earned properly — because material val
ues are prerequisites of human life, and I
hold that human life is the only logical stan
dard by which to judge values. In other
words, values are objectively gtn>d or bad.

They are anything but subjective, which is
what The Daily's headline implied.
