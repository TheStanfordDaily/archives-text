# Students launch Web site to voice opinion on election
## 
### CASEY KAUFFMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Main Americans are feeling frustrated
about the confusion that lias followed last
week's presidential election, so two Stan
lord students de< ided do something about
it.
\i men Berjikly, a senior, and (orinne
Nates, ,t junior, set up a Web site called
SavethePresidcncv.com last week.
"We ( reated the site- fora fair election
.iiid are tr\ing to use .t common sense ap
proa< h." Berjikh said. "If 'this drags on too
long people will begin not to care. We
want people to be able to go to sleep and
leel something lair happened because
people are upset and disgusted In the
whole process."
\< cording to its founders, SavethePres
idencv.com is .t non-partisan (.ill to stop
the destruction of the presidency that is
"pro-common sense'' rather than being
pro-Vice President Al (ioreor pro-lexas

(iov. (ieorge W. Bush.
"Partially justified lawsuits and delays
are tempting lor an election decided by
such small numbers," the Web site reads,
"but i hex are hut ting our nation's political
psyche and sending our respect lor Amer
ica's political institutions and offices into a
downward spiral from which there can be
little hope of return."
I he Web site consists of'a petition that is
directed to the Gore campaign. It de
mands that the vice president either accept
the original count and therefore concede
or allow .t statewide hand count as a final
option.
I lie petition is directed at the Gore
campaign because Gore was the first to
take legal action, Berjikly and Yates said. A
hand recount provides more votes lor all
candidates and because the Gore cam
paign asked lor a hand recount of lour
largeh Democratic counties, the recount
would disadvantage Bush.
I'lie founders of the Web site feel that

(.ore shouldn't dragon the election. 1 low
ever, if 'Gore agrees to a full hand count
throughout the entire state of Florida, the
Webmasters think Bush should agree to it.
Although the site is intended to be non
partisan. other Stanford students leel that
the petition is direc ted too strongly at the
(iore campaign and advocates that he con
cede the election.
" 1 his Web site is partisan," said senior
Krista Glaser, chair ol the Stanford De
mocrats. "We do need to save the presi
dency, but in a lair and accurate way. We
shouldn't quicken the steps the way the
Republic ans want to. We need to take the
appropriate legal steps and acknowledge
ili.it tlie butterlh ballot used in Palm
Beach (ounty is illegal."
Berjikly clarified his position.
"We do trust the legal system," Berjikly
said. "We're not pushing a resolution to
hide the facts. As long as it's going to take a
long lime, it should be done in a lair way."
112 reshman Michael Ybarra had mixed

feelings about the Web site.
"It's definitely partisan, but the site
makes some very good points," he said.
"You can't compare machine counts and
hand counts. If there is a recount, it should
be throughout the whole slate."
The lear that lawsuits and delays are
hurting the nation's political psyche and
undermining our institutions is one of the
root causes for the creation of the Web site.
Although both Republicans and De
mocrats are frustrated about the election
process, Glaser feels that the I nited States
needs to go through every step in order to
uphold the democratic process that is
readily prescribed to people worldwide.
"Everyone wants to move on with a
sense of closure," Glaser said. "The only
way to achieve this sense of closure and to
end the frustration is logo through the ap
propriate legal processes. We will all be
hurt in the long run by hast\ decisions."
SavelhePresidency.com is not alone in
the surge of political c ommunication that

the uncertainty of election 2000 lias
caused. Many people argue that the inde
cision will make Americans upset about
politics in the future.
"As ol Monday afternoon, Yahoo's mes
sage board had attracted some 373,000
postings on the electoral results," said Pa
tricia Jacobus from CnetNews.com.
"CNN's site carried about 346,000 and
thousands of people are hitting chat
boards to sound off, or more rarely, creat
ing their own Web sites detailing their
takes on the situation."
Glaser believes that Americans
shouldn't rush to a judgment.
"Many more Web sites will appear as
people take an interest in politics again,"
Glaser said. "Some will have a sense of ur
gency. We need to be patient and consid
er the fact that everything is stable right
now. Having this patience is crucial. Our
sense of democracy and how other coun
tries perceive us is on the line so we need
to do this legitimately."
