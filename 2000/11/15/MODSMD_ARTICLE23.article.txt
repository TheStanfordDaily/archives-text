# Ruling allows grad student TAs to unionize
## NLRB decision OKed despite opposition by Stanford 
### NINA CANN-WOODE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In spile of legal briefs filed In Stanford and
several other universities, the National Labor
Relations Hoard ruled Nov. 1 that graduate
siudenis who work as research and teaching
assistants at private schools have the right to
unionize and negotiate wages and employ
ment benefits.
I lit- ruling, l<dlowing a closely watched (ase
involving graduate TAs at New York Universi
ty, is a reversal of ihc Hoard's position from the
mid-19705, when it declared interns and resi
dents 10 be students and not employees, I here
in denying them ihe right to unionize.
We find there is no basis lo deny collective
bargaining 1 ights to statutory employees mere
ly because ihey are emploved by an education
al institution in which they are enrolled as siu
denis," the board ruled in a M-0 vote.
Stanford was one of seven private universi
iics including Princeton, Yale and Johns 1 lop
kins thai filed legal briefs with the labor board
supporting the position taken by NYU. urging
the Hoard not toallow the unionization of grad
uate students.
University administrators said unionization
could conceivably alter the relationship be
tween professors and their students.
"Unionization changes the dynamic of the
student-laculty relationship by reducing the
closeness and flexibility of arrangements

[made] between the students and faculty," said
Debra Zumwalt, Stanford's acting general
counsel.
University Provost John Ltchemendy clari
fied Stanford's position.
"Teaching is part of the graduate students'
education,' said University Provost John
Etchemendy. "The problem with thinking of
1 As as employees is that we require teaching of
every graduate student. II I As are seen as em
ployees, then it would be lour to five times more
expensive [to employ them] than lecturers.
That's why we and the other major universities
objec tto calling I'As employees."
According to Zumwalt, the main points of
the universities' amicus briefs highlighted
the importance of understanding .i gradu
ate student's status in relation to his or her
ins) it lit ion.
" I here are p< >li< \ reas< >ns as to wh\ graduate
students should be treated differently than em
ployees in the normal employer-employee set
ting," Zumwalt said, " l eac hing assistants and
research assistants are students and different
from employees in a business selling and there
fore should not be considered employees
under the National Labor Relations \< I.
"The legal precedent establishes that lAs
and [resident assistants] are not employees
under the Act," she added.
A 1974 decision of the \LRH ruled that re
search assistants in the Stanford Physics De
partment could not unionize because the\ were
primarily students, and thus not employees
under the meaning of the Act, said Zumwalt.
Some labor experts said the decision will
probably fuel organizing ellorts in < >t her private

universities across the country. But siu li ellorts
would undoubtedly run into some obstacles,
said Thomas Rochan, a prolessor at the Sloan
School ol Management at Mil . because gradu
ate students would be union members onl\ lor
a limited period ol lime and have loyalties both
as students and employees.
"1 don't expect this loset oil .1 firestorm ol or
ganizing at all ol the lop universiiies." lie said in
the Nov. 2 issue ol The New York limes. "But
ii is likely to have an elle< t on some."
Julie Kushner, subregional director Ibi ihe
United Automobile Workers. whi< Ii worked to
organize the N\ I students, contended the
unionization ellbrt would probabh demand .1
certain dedication, but remained optimistic.
"There is no question that tins is going to
spread," -.lie told The 1 imcs.
1 he unions promise higher pav and better
working conditions lor graduate students, w ho
traditionally earn very little.
Harris Shapiro, a doctoral student in
physics, does not think the dc< ision is not espe
cially pertinent to Stanford graduate students.
"During my time .is < hair ol the (iraduate
Student ('.ouncil, it w.is always < le.ll tli.it it was
neither neccssan nor desirable loi graduate
students at Stanlbrd to unionize." lie said.
Currently, no graduate students at private
universities have been allowed to unionize.
However, some have created organizations to
support unionization, in< luding Yale's (iradu
ate Kmployees .ind Students ()rganization.
011 the other hand, graduate students at
some public universities, including I ( -Bei ke
lev and the I nivcrsit\ ol M.iss.u husetts. are al
lowed to uni< >nize.
