## Villarreal leads the Cardinal harriers 
### MINAYO NASIALI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's the last thousand meters of the course
and one last rush of adrenaline fuels the will
and overcomes physical fatigue. It is time to
kick, it is time to push, it is time for senior
crosscountry team captain Elena Villarreal's
most challenging but fulfilling part of the
race.
"With a thousand meters left it's the point
when you're the most tired," said Villarreal.
"But it's the most satisfying feeling to pass
your opponents and run in a way you never
thought possible. You'll see a girl 15 feet
ahead of you, and fora split second, you
think you could never pass her, but then you
fight hard, sprint past, cross the finish line,
and wonder how you did it. You exhaust
yourself; you put mind over bodv. It's a beau
tiful moment."
Villarreal grew up in Englewood, Colo., a
small town 15 minutes south of Denver. Her
father, Luis, runs a mentoring organization
for inner-city youth, and her mother, Nancy,
takes care of the home. Villarreal is the old
est of three children.
Running is Villarreal's blood. Her father
beginning the legacy as a cross country and
track runner at YVestmont College in Santa
Barbara.
I ler sister is also involved iu cross country
and track, and Villarreal's brother is a mem
ber ol the high school football team and plans
on trying out for track.
"My father's passion lor running initial!)
sparked my interest iu the sport. He ran
cross country and the steeple chase in track,

so I guess I have runner's blood," Villarreal
said.
With her father's encouragement, Villar
real began her cross country career as a
freshman in high school and spent the sum
mer before her freshman year in high school
training, 112 ler first race was a large and gruel
ing one, with 300 runners competing on an
extremely challenging course.
"There were two parts in the course where
we had to jump down an embankment into
water, and then climb up a ravine on the
other side," Villearreal said. "I remember
being so nervous before the race, and think
ing, 'Lord just help me to finish this race!' M\
dad called from the sidelines, 'It's okav
Elena, you're going to do fine.' Well, I ended
up finishing seventh. I couldn't believe I'd
placed in the top 10. I knew then that cross
country was mv passion."
Villarreal continued her passion for cross
country throughout high school. She was a
team captain for three years and captured
the Colorado state track titles in the 1,000
and 3,200 meters in her junior season. She
was heralded as the Denver Post / Denver
Athletic Club inaugural female student-ath
lete of the year. Throughout her high school
career she maintained a 4.4 C.P.A.
At Stanford, Villarreal continued to excel
as a 1998 All-Academic cross countn selec
tion, .ind .i 1999 .uul 2000 Pac-10 All-Acade
mic track and field selection.
As an athlete participating in c ross coun
try and track and field year-round, Villarreal
admits she has to maintain a disciplined
schedule, and sometimes feels detac lied from
the average Stanford student. Bedtime lor

Villarreal is early and practices are every day.
Balanced with work and academics, she leads
a full life.
"Sometimes I feel like I'm missing out on
the college experience, but running has put
many positive constraints on my life," Villar
real said. "Running is a good release for me.
If the da\ is stressful, I can always look for
ward to a quality workout and spending time
with my teammates."
Villarreal is a political science major and
although unsure about her plans after col
lege, is considering joining the Peace (lorps.
She enjoys crafts and graphic design, par
ticipates in Cornerstone and runs a team
Bible study.
As a senior and team captain of the No. 2-
rankecl cross country team, Villarreal is ex
periencing the most successful season of her
college career. She placed first .it the Fresno
State Invitational finished second at Sacra
mento State, placed seventh at the Stanford
Invitational, placed 13th overall at the PreN
CAAs but was the first Stanford finisher and
finished fourth at last weekend's West Re
gional.
Next weekend is the NCAA Champi
onship in lowa, and Villarreal, backed b\ her
family's support and her strong faith, is more
than prepared.
" I lie downtimes I've had were all part of
the process to get me to this point," Villarreal
said. "It makes this time so much sweeter,
and I've learned first hand that hard work al
wa\ s pavs off. I feel so luck\ to be able to rep
resent our s< liool, and expend so muc li posi
tive energy. I want to bring home t he big one
ihis year at nationals."'
