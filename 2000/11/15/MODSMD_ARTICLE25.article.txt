# Pac-10 basketball shoots for the top
## With the No.1 national ranking, Arizona is the conference favorite; Card challenges for title 
### MALCOLM LEVINE 
As the 2000-2001 men's college
basketball season begins, the Pacif
ic 10 Conference stands out as
perhaps the most powerful in the
country, ready to send up to live
teams to the NGAA tournament
come March.
I he league is led ibis year by
the top-ranked team in the coun
try, Arizona, while Stanford ex
pects to battle the Wildcats lor the
conference championship and
probable No. 1 seed in the West
Region. The path to the confer
ence title will bv no means be easy,
because, as I (.LA coach Steve
Lavin said a couple weeks ago,
"the league might lie the strongest
I've ever seen it."
Arizona
Before even stepping on the
court ibis season, Ari/ona made
N(■ A\ basketball histon by hav
ing live players named to the 50-
player list ol finalists for the
Wooden Award, given out annu
ally to the top player in the coun
try.
Ari/ona has depth at every po
sition, led by perhaps the best
backcourt in the nation, Jason
Gardner and Gilbert Arenas, and
7-foot-1 center Loren Woods.
Gardner and Arenas, both sopho
mores, remind many of the old
Wildcat backcourt of Damon
Stoudamire and Khalid Reeves
with their dominating perimeter

play. Woods, a preseason First
I cam All-American, returns for
his fifth year oi eligibilit\. months
after turning clown millions of dol
lars in the NBA. fully healtln after
last year's back injury.
All Pac-10 forward Michael
Wright and Richard Jefferson
complete the front-line that looks
to control the paint while the back
court performs its magic .
Although it's early, Arizona al
ready has the confidence of a na
tional c hampionship team. "Ifyou
had to draw up a college basket
ball team," said Jefferson, "how
could vou draw up a bettei team?
On paper, we're as good as it
gets."
However, basketball is not
played on paper, and no one is
ready to concede the l'ac-10
crown just yet.
Stanford
Stanford plans to contend with
the Wildcats .ill season, reiving on
one ol the best iron (courts in the
nation and sophomore sharp
shooter C '.asev Jacobsen.
()n the front-line, the (Cardinal
hopes to weather the loss of All-
American forward Mark Madsen
with increased production from
senior Jason and redshirt sopho
more Jarron ( ollins as well as con
tinned long-range suc cess of red
shirt senior Ryan Mendez.
Stanford has a luxury not
shared by most teams in the coun
try in its ability to bring talented 7-
foot sophomore Curtis Bern hardt
oil the bench as a shot-blocking
menace.
I he Cardinal's hopes of knock
ing off Arizona probably hinge on

Terry Cutnmings, is I lie team's

great, dropping 24 points on

I lit- Bruins have more (|i»cs
tion marks than any other team in
the league, but if they play up to
their potential, they tan be an ex
treinelv dangerous team in
March.
California
I'lie fiflh team in the l'ac-10
with a realistic shot at an NCAA
berth is (!al, which returns .ill live
starters from List year's s<|uad.
Without a doubt, (lit- fate of
Cal rests on the shoulders of (>-
foot-7 forward Sean Fampley.
()ne of the best all-around play
ers in 11 it* l'ac-10, Fampley has
the talent to carry the lieai s, but
how far only tinic will tell. II a
second storing option steps up

for the Hears and takes some of
the defensive pressure oil Famp
ley, Cal could surprise some peo
ple this year.
Oregon and Oregon State
After (lal, there isa major drop
off in the bottom half of confer
encc competition. Oregon State
and Oregon are potential N.I.T.
teams, but that is the most that t i
ll let team can hope to accomplish.
()i egon, with two blue-chip fresh
men, Fukc Ritlnour and l.uke
Jackson, will be extremely danger
ous in a year or two, but the league
is too tough this year for either
school to have expectations of
c racking the top four teams in the
league.
The rest of the Pac-10
Rounding out (lie bottom of
the league are Arizona State,
Washington State and Washing
ton. Arizona State needs to find a

way to make up F.tftlie House's
points a game, and there is
just not enough talent on (lie
team to do so, in what looks to be
a rebuilding year for the Sun
I )evils.
Meanwhile, both Washington
State and Washington weathered
serious losses before the season has
even started, which should sup
plant them in 1 1 it- league's cellar.
Washington State's star recruit.
Tommy Johnson, has been
deemed academically ineligible for
the season and Washington's best
player, Sentjue Carev, transferred
to New Mexico. Neither team lias
the talent it)contend in the league,
and both will probabh struggle to
win five games.
As a whole, the conference is
stacked ibis year with talented
teams and potential superstars, so
l'at-10 fans should get read) for
what is shaping up to be an excit
ing season out west.
