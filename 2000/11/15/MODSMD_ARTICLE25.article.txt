# Pac-10 basketball shoots for the top
## With the No.1 national ranking, Arizona is the conference favorite; Card challenges for title 
### MALCOLM LEVINE 
As the 2000-2001 men's college
basketball season begins, the Pacif
ic 10 Conference stands out as
perhaps the most powerful in the
country, ready to send up to live
teams to the NGAA tournament
come March.
I he league is led ibis year by
the top-ranked team in the coun
try, Arizona, while Stanford ex
pects to battle the Wildcats lor the
conference championship and
probable No. 1 seed in the West
Region. The path to the confer
ence title will bv no means be easy,
because, as I (.LA coach Steve
Lavin said a couple weeks ago,
"the league might lie the strongest
I've ever seen it."
Arizona
Before even stepping on the
court ibis season, Ari/ona made
N(â–  A\ basketball histon by hav
ing live players named to the 50-
player list ol finalists for the
Wooden Award, given out annu
ally to the top player in the coun
try.
Ari/ona has depth at every po
sition, led by perhaps the best
backcourt in the nation, Jason
Gardner and Gilbert Arenas, and
7-foot-1 center Loren Woods.
Gardner and Arenas, both sopho
mores, remind many of the old
Wildcat backcourt of Damon
Stoudamire and Khalid Reeves
with their dominating perimeter

play. Woods, a preseason First
I cam All-American, returns for
his fifth year oi eligibilit\. months
after turning clown millions of dol
lars in the NBA. fully healtln after
last year's back injury.
All Pac-10 forward Michael
Wright and Richard Jefferson
complete the front-line that looks
to control the paint while the back
court performs its magic .
Although it's early, Arizona al
ready has the confidence of a na
tional c hampionship team. "Ifyou
had to draw up a college basket
ball team," said Jefferson, "how
could vou draw up a bettei team?
On paper, we're as good as it
gets."
However, basketball is not
played on paper, and no one is
ready to concede the l'ac-10
crown just yet.
Stanford
Stanford plans to contend with
the Wildcats .ill season, reiving on
one ol the best iron (courts in the
nation and sophomore sharp
shooter C '.asev Jacobsen.
()n the front-line, the (Cardinal
hopes to weather the loss of All-
American forward Mark Madsen
with increased production from
senior Jason and redshirt sopho
more Jarron ( ollins as well as con
tinned long-range suc cess of red
shirt senior Ryan Mendez.
Stanford has a luxury not
shared by most teams in the coun
try in its ability to bring talented 7-
foot sophomore Curtis Bern hardt
oil the bench as a shot-blocking
menace.
I he Cardinal's hopes of knock
ing off Arizona probably hinge on
