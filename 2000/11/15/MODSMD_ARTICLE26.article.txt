## 
### MATT LONG STAFF WRITER 
Last lime a Stanford men's
basketball team lost an exibiiion
game, it went on to make the
Final Four.
Based on multiple preseason
top-live rankings, the Final
Four again appears possible lot
the (Cardinal, but this year's ex
plosive squad doesn't look
ready to lose after a 107-71
romp over the (ilobal Spoils All-
Stars.
The No. 4 Cardinal (2-0)
dosed out its exibiiion schedule
with a win in which every player
on the active roster scored, and
the starling five played sparing
ly in the second hall. Global, a
team of former college players,
has previously gone 7-4 against
Division 1 competition.
Though Stanford lowered
over (ilobal, who listed its tallest
player at 6-foot-8 it relied on the
three-point shot through much
of the first half, and finished the
game 16 for 29 from outside the
arc.
"They're actually a talented
team whose had some good
wins," said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery. "We're making
progress. We are probably 75
percent of what we should or
could be."
Sophomore center Curtis
Borchardt paced Stanford with
19 points and nine rebounds in
just 17 minutes, including two
treys in as many tries for the 7
foot postman.

"Curtis can shoot from
there," said Montgomery. "II
you isolate the inside guy we
have a player who c an shoot the
ball. Ifwe force them to defend
that shot I lien ii gives us a good
look inside."
Senior point guard Mike Mc -
Donald added I I points, and
scored the Cardinal's lirst nine,
with three straight threes,
pointers, while spending just 1 W
minutes on the lloor, partly be
cause <>l .1 sore loot.
The squad opens regular
season competition Sundax at
home against San Francisco
Stale, and injuries may plav a
role in that game's lineup.
Along with McDonald, Bor
chardt has just returned from
injun and redshirt swingmati
Justin Davis, hyped as a rising
star in the offseason, will miss
the opener and the lirst tourna
ment of the season, the Puerto
Rico Invitational, with a pulled
abdominal muscle.
"We can't seem to get every
body at 100 percent," said
Montgomery. "We just have to
keep working and see what we
have."
Stanford jumped out to a 9-0
lead, but (>lobal's sharpshooting
veterans cut the Cardinal ad
vantage to 15-14. Behind a Mc -
Donald three and another
bomb from the top of the kev by
Jarron Collins, Stanford
jumped ahead by 11. Global
had no chance to crash the
hoards or penetrate with I lie
Collins twins and Borchardt
standing tall, and kicked ihe ball
oni to their sharpshcK)ters who
brought the game to 32-SO.
But thai was as close as Clohal
would come, and after leading 45-
M at halltime. the Cardinal start
ed the half on a 9-0 run and never
looked hack at their overmatched
and undersized opponents.
