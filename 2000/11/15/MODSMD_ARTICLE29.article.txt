### BILL BOWEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Administrative officials want Stanford stu
dents to know the University is serious about
safety at Big Game.
Assistant Dean of' Students Nanci Howe and
Associate Dean of Students Morris Graves en
couraged ASSU Undergraduate Senators to
remind students of safety regulations in last
night's ASSU Undergraduate Senate meeting.
"We want you all to encourage people to be
careful about their health and safety, and par
ticularly not to go out on the field," I lowe said.
Fhe actions of students who rushed the
field last year and in previous years have led to
several injuries and hundreds of thousands of
dollars damage to University property.
The reason we adopted these measures is
that Big Game has gotten out of hand in terms
ol what happens on the field afterward,"
C 1 raves said.
Injuries from post-game violence and con
fusion have prompted administrators to take
increasingly strong security measures in re
cent years. Students found in violation of safe

ty policies may be brought before judicial af
fairs.
"Both universities want students to go out
and cheer for their teams, but in good sports
manship," Graves said. "If the violent aspects
of the post-game continue, the I niversity will
have to look at finding .» neutral site for the
game away from both campuses."
In other news, the Senate is considering a
constitutional amendment that will change
the election procedure for the ASSU presi
dent and vice president.
Under the current system, candidates who
do not receive a majority vote in the first elec -
tion must participate in a separate runoff. I lie
proposed amendment would allow students
to mark second c hoices on their ballot and
would look to these choices to determine the
winner of an election in which no candidate
has a clear majority.
The search for members ol the Constitu
tional Council continue. The choices ap
proved by the Senate in previous meetings
were invalid because the nominations process
violated established ASSI bylaws. The bylaws
require nominees to be presented to the Sen

ateb\ I lie ASS I : president before being exam
ined In i lie* Senate's Administration and Rules
Committee.
I lie Senate approved nomination of fresh
man Lief Hanford, freshman Amibili
Khamachadran, freshman Rosa Villegas,
sophomore Clea Kaske and senior Summer
Waggoner to the Founder's Day Subcommit
tee established to help organize and publicize
Founder's Day activities.
Also, junior Cody Muhly stepped down as
the elections commissioner. Senior Joe
Narens was nominated to lill his place.
I lie Senate also approved funding for var
ious student groups, including the Cardinal
Ballet Company, the Stanford Ethiopian Stu
dent I nion, the Stanford ()bjectivist (Hub and
the Stanford University Mathematical Orga
nization.
The Senate also approved a proposal by
ASSU Publications Director Jacob Klein, a se
nior, to allow ASSU Publications access to its
reserve funds. In addition, the Senate ap
proved access to % 12,(>55 that will be used to
revamp the common rooms in the Storke Pub
lications Building.
