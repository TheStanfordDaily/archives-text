I tidergi aduate residence halls
a( ross Stanford will vote this week
on whether their dining halls will
participate in the United Farm
Workers' controversial boycott on
( alilbrnia table grapes. I he anim
al vole, implemented in 1994. de
termines which dining halls will
serve grapes during the coming
year.
1 he issue first attracted concern
in 19X7 when MKC.IiA and the
ASM Senate requested that the
I'niversity develop a policy in re
gard to i he serving of grapes. The
I F\\ had railed lor a boycott ol
non-union (lalilornia table grapes
beginning in 1984 in light of evi
dence ih <ii pesticides used In
grape growers were harmful to I lie
workers who maintained and har
vested the grapes.
I he c urrent policv allowing lor
vcarlv votes was established in
1994. l liat year, hungei strikers
demanded, among other things,
that the I niversity ban grapes
from all residences. Then-l niver

Provost C.onclolee//a Rice re
sponded b\ establishing the C irape
Policy (Committee.
Vfter consideration, the Grape
Policy Committee suggested "ex
pandfing] the current policv" by
broadening the education effort
and, where possible, requiring
that residences make "regular, for
mal decisions" about the boy< ott.
Proponents ol the boycott sa\
(hat table grape workers in (Cali
fornia work under conditions that
are unacceptable. Most grape
workers ,n e non-unioni/eel, and as
such lac k a unified voice in labor
disputes.
I hie to the large amount ol pes
ticides used on table grapes, labor
ers run a relativeh high risk ofde

veloping skin diseases such as der
matitis, ,i< cording to a surve\ con
ducted b\ the California Pesticide
Illness Surveillance Program be
tween 1982 and 1992. There is
also evidence that animals exposed
to the pesticides used on table
grapes run a higher risk of ton
trading some form of cancer.
Opponents of the boycott sav
that ihe issue is primatil) a labor
dispute, not a human lights issue.
Critics note that it has long vexed
the I 1 W that most seasonal agri
cultural laborers are non-union
ized, and they point out the fact
that the boycott does not extend to
union grapes. Nor does it include
foreign grapes, which are even
more likely to be grown under
conditions hazardous to laborers
ih.in domestic grapes, according
to the Crape Polic\ Committee's
1994 report.
Detractors of the boycott also
contend that there are numerous
other products whose methods of
productions pose health risks to
workers.
"I think you could come up

with some [objection) like that lor
any food." said freshman
Jonathan Wrobel. "Coal miners
get black lungs, but we don't boy
cott coal."
I he Crape Policy Committee
report noted also that the Envi
ronmental Protection Agency al
ready regulates pesticide use, re
quiring licenses for users and ban
ning those pesticides that are
clearly harmful to humans. The
UFW's boycott originally focused
on live pestic ides in use at itfe time:
dinoseb partition, phosdrin,
methyl bromide and captan.
All five are now either banned
or in the process of being phased
out.
Boycott supporters see this as
evidence that their effort is pro
ducing positive effects. I he argu
ments supporting the boycott on
the Stanford grapes boycott Web
site maintain that "enforcement
of regulations is not satisfactory
or sufficient." Ihe arguments
also sav that "up to 20 new car
