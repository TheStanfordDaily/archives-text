### CHRISTOPHER LYLE RAVI SARIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Over ilit' past few years, Peter
Thiel has lac ed I lie Russian
mafia, a hypnotizing business
strategist, high power encryption
.ind the transfer ol countless mil
lions of dollars.

current CEO ol X.com, he has
been dealing with all ol these is
sues and more since 1998.
Easing online transactions
Pay I*a 1 is an e-mail-based
money-transfer system. If you
purchase something on eßay,
you can pay the seller with Pay-
Pal. I lie seller doesn't even have
to have an account to receive
money. When you receive money
from Pay Pal, you can leave it in
vour account or transfer it to a
bank or credit card.

l*ityl'al can be used with wire
less devices .is well, such as cellu
lar phones. For example, il
you're out of money, you c an call
up a friend who can send you
money via his or her cellular
phone. Ihe money is instantly
placed in your account, and with
ilit- Pay Pal debit card, which is
set to be relesed soon, you can go
to an A I M and withdraw money
immediately.
Thiel the entrepreneur
I hiel spent seven years at
Stanford — four stud\ ing philos
ophy ,is .111 undergraduate and
three at the Law School, lie then
headed for New York to work for
a large law firm. After seven
months, I hiel had had enough.
I Ie left the firm and went to work
as an options trader in New York
and London.
I hiel returned to Northern
California, however, in 1995 to
start a small investment fund that
i|uickl\ found a locus in Internet
investments. During the summer
of 1998, I bid's career path took
a dramatic turn that resulted in
the birth of Pay Pal.
Thiel met Pay Pal's other co
founder, Max Levchin. Levchin
was interested in cryptograpln
and < omputer security, and I hiel
shared interests in encryption
with a focus in finance. They

began i<> brainstorm ways that
their interests could meld into a
company.
I be duo's first idea was to cre
ate a secure method of sending
money between Palm pilots.
I hey quickly decided that, since
not everyone had a Palm pilot,
they would make a way to send
money from a I'alm to any recipi
ent. I his idea evohed into the
current Pay Pal model. Since
there are a relatively small num
ber ol people with Palm pilots,
they decided to drop that re
quirement entirelv and create a
method lor anyone to transfer
money electronically.
111 a large pat i due to Pavpal's
ease ol use, it is no surprise that
PavPal has grown significantly
since its launch in October IJMM).
I here are now more than \ mil
lion Pa)' Pal users. Combined,
ilicst- users transfer well over $(>
million a day.
Pay Pal now ranks as the r>()ili
most popular sue on the Web,
and the No. 1 financial services
site, ranking above the likes of
e*trade and Wells Fargo accord
ing to PCDataOnline. Pay Pal is
used to handle payments for
more than 50 percent of cP>av
pun liases. I here is also a grow
ing number ol businesses using
PavPal to accept money from
consumers.
I he potential lor growth is enor
mous, because in the 1 nited States
alone, there are 1.'5. r > million people
with e-mail. Pa\ Pal is now expand
ing worldwide to allow people to
make pun bases from abroad using
the system.
Pay Pal makes money by
charging businesses a small per

rentage of each transaction.
Consumers can use the service
lor free.
When Pay Pal launched, its
biggest competitor was X.com.
X.coni offered similar sen ices lo
Pay Pal, and the two companies
competed intensely with each
other initially. However, they
soon found it in their best inter
ests to merge. I oday, the corpo
rate name of the company is
X.com while their product is
Pay Pal.
Although Pay Pal controls HO
percent ol the market for e-mail
payments, Yahoo! has recently
launched its own service, Pa\ Di
rect, that competes with PavPal.
Other sites also have sprung up
to lake some market share away
from Pay Pal, including PavPlace
.ind Bill Point.
"In older lor Pay Pal to contin
ue its success, execution is the
most important factor. We have
built 111> a very large user base
«md have excellent growth, hut
we need to make sure that we
continue to provide the best ser
vices for our users." said Jawed
karim, a Pay Pal employee.
Shaken, not stirred
Corporate mergers and brand
ing do nol sound like the stull that
superheroes are made of, but don't
be looted. 1 here is more lo 1 hied
than meets I he eye.
Over the past several months.
I liiel has been going head to
head with the leader ol <i Russian
mafia group from Kazakhstan
who uses the alias "(ueg." Appar
ently, dreg obtained .i compact
dis( ili.it contains credit card in
formation for thousands ol dif
ferent credit cards, Cl eg's group
created <i computer program that
would aulomatiealh create ac
counts on Pay Pal and link ilieni
to the stolen credit cards. I lie

program would then send niontn
from the credit card to the other
accounts it had set up, siphoning
the money around until it all
ended up in one account. At that
point, the money would be trans
ferred to an account in a U.S.
bank and wired to an account in
Kazakhstan.
Now thai is secrel agent male
rial. I hiel began a mission to slop
(ireg while maintaining the llexi
bilitv and convenience ol Pay Pal
for oilier users. I he first step was
to break ilie automation. I 'hiel
did Ihis by implementing a lea
lure during account registration
that ( ould onl\ be performed b\ a
human. A set ol alphanumeric
(liana ters were random!) gener
ated and plat ed in a graphic on a
background that c ould nol be in
terpreted b\ a computer. A usei
would have to c(>p\ ihe numbers
into a confirmation box to be able
lo register.
I his shut down (ireg fora
short while, but he quickly re
sponded in outsourcing the en
tering of the security characters
lo cheap labor in Indonesia.
I hiel then turned to a security
feature on credit cards that be
came the final solution. On the
b.K k of every c redit c ard, there
are three digits that are nol
stored anywhere except on the
physical card and in the credit
card company's databases.
Now, when you link a credit
card to a Pa\ Pal account, you
enter these digits lot verifica
tion. I nfortunateh lor Creg,
the compact discs did not have
thai exti a information.
For I hiel, however, shutting
down Creg was just part ol an
other da\ at the office in ihe un
predictable world ol startups.
And il \<mi are wondering wlial

ophy ,is .111 undergraduate and
three at the Law School, lie then
headed for New York to work for
a large law firm. After seven
months, I hiel had had enough.
I Ie left the firm and went to work
as an options trader in New York
and London.
I hiel returned to Northern
California, however, in 1995 to
start a small investment fund that
i|uickl\ found a locus in Internet
investments. During the summer
of 1998, I bid's career path took
a dramatic turn that resulted in
the birth of Pay Pal.
Thiel met Pay Pal's other co
founder, Max Levchin. Levchin
was interested in cryptograpln
and < omputer security, and I hiel
shared interests in encryption
with a focus in finance. They

began i<> brainstorm ways that
their interests could meld into a
company.
I be duo's first idea was to cre
ate a secure method of sending
money between Palm pilots.
I hey quickly decided that, since
not everyone had a Palm pilot,
they would make a way to send
money from a I'alm to any recipi
ent. I his idea evohed into the
current Pay Pal model. Since
there are a relatively small num
ber ol people with Palm pilots,
they decided to drop that re
quirement entirelv and create a
method lor anyone to transfer
money electronically.
111 a large pat i due to Pavpal's
ease ol use, it is no surprise that
PavPal has grown significantly
since its launch in October IJMM).
I here are now more than \ mil
lion Pa)' Pal users. Combined,
ilicst- users transfer well over $(>
million a day.
Pay Pal now ranks as the r>()ili
most popular sue on the Web,
and the No. 1 financial services
site, ranking above the likes of
e*trade and Wells Fargo accord
ing to PCDataOnline. Pay Pal is
used to handle payments for
more than 50 percent of cP>av
pun liases. I here is also a grow
ing number ol businesses using
PavPal to accept money from
consumers.
I he potential lor growth is enor
mous, because in the 1 nited States
alone, there are 1.'5. r > million people
with e-mail. Pa\ Pal is now expand
ing worldwide to allow people to
make pun bases from abroad using
the system.
Pay Pal makes money by
charging businesses a small per

rentage of each transaction.
Consumers can use the service
lor free.
When Pay Pal launched, its
biggest competitor was X.com.
X.coni offered similar sen ices lo
Pay Pal, and the two companies
competed intensely with each
other initially. However, they
soon found it in their best inter
ests to merge. I oday, the corpo
rate name of the company is
X.com while their product is
Pay Pal.
Although Pay Pal controls HO
percent ol the market for e-mail
payments, Yahoo! has recently
launched its own service, Pa\ Di
rect, that competes with PavPal.
Other sites also have sprung up
to lake some market share away
from Pay Pal, including PavPlace
.ind Bill Point.
"In older lor Pay Pal to contin

Over ilit' past few years, Peter
Thiel has lac ed I lie Russian

strategist, high power encryption
.ind the transfer ol countless mil
lions of dollars.
Superagent? Not quite. But, as
the co-founder, Chairman, and
current CEO ol X.com, he has
been dealing with all ol these is
sues and more since 1998.
Easing online transactions
Pay I*a 1 is an e-mail-based
money-transfer system. If you
purchase something on eßay,
you can pay the seller with Pay-
Pal. I lie seller doesn't even have
to have an account to receive
money. When you receive money
from Pay Pal, you can leave it in
vour account or transfer it to a
bank or credit card.

l*ityl'al can be used with wire
less devices .is well, such as cellu
lar phones. For example, il
you're out of money, you c an call
up a friend who can send you
money via his or her cellular
phone. Ihe money is instantly
placed in your account, and with
ilit- Pay Pal debit card, which is
set to be relesed soon, you can go
to an A I M and withdraw money
immediately.
