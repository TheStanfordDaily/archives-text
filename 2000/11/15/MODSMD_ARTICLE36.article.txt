The distance, in light years,
of the neutron star RX
J185035-3754 from earth, the
closest of its kind ever ob
served. A neutron star is the
ultra-dense product of a col
lapsed star, composed entirely
of neutrons. A typical neutron
star is a 100 million times
denser than steel. According to
astronomers, this particular
one is the product of a stellar
explosion that would have

years in about 300,000 years.
Its trajectory was caught in
three Hubble snapshots taken
in 1096 and 1999.
