# Are we ready for online voting?
## 
### ABIGAIL PHILLIPS 
As a first-lime Silicon Valley
voter, I was looking forward to .1
high-tech extravaganza at the
polling booth. 1 used to he regis
tered in New York ( it\. which uses
those clunky, curtained booths that
operate like old-lashionecl eleva
tors. You stand in front of a podi
um of switches that correspond i<>
candidates. When you finish
"switching", you drag <i level below
the switchboard, and voila! your
vote is registered.
Solas! 1 uesday, when I w,is ush
ered into a room of open c arrels,
handed a paper ballot, and told 10
punch, 1 was truly astonished.
What's the story with this antedilu
vian system? While this year ma\
have been revolutionary in terms ol
Internet campaigning, widespread
online voting still seems lobe a long
wav off.

I his year saw America's first
dalliance with legally valid online
voting. During Arizona's presidential prima
ry in March, the Democratic Partv gave mem
bers llie option of c asting their ballots online.
And on flection Day, the federal Voting As
sistance Program held online elections in lour
states for residents living abroad. In the clays
leading up to November 7th, several slates in
cluding California ran experiments with on
line voting.
Voters in San Diego, San Mateo, Sacramen
to, and ('ontra (losta participated in mock elec -
tions In submitting ballots over a closed net
work from PCs at designated locations. Ballots
were encrypted and dispatched to a remote
server, where state officials used a special kev to
decrypt the results and count the votes.
I he feedback from participants in the trials
was overwhelmingly positive—both for ease ol
use and interest in future use. While the Cali
fornia votes were not legally valid, the experi
ments anticipate a day when they might be.
Still, it's going to be a while before we're cast
ing ballots from our laptops in the middle of
class. Civen voting's fundamental role in our
democracy, no one would hasten to tinker with
the vote in a way that could jeopardize its in
tegrity. At present, the potential hazards ol on
line voting are simply too great to c hance, and
we have some distance to go bclbre the dangers

are eradicated.
Perceived risks of online voting are imper
fect sec urity, technology llaws, voiei cliscrimi
nation along the digital divide, and devaluation
of political participation.
Imperfect security
Fraud is a chief seem it \ concern with online
voting. Current security and encr\ption mea
sures aren't strong enough to guarantee voiei
integrity and voter privacy against elec ire>ni< .il
iac ks. We have no reliable means of prole* ting
ballots or ensuring that no one's vole is I rat ked.
Kven viruses and server crashes inn elated to at
tacks on the vote could scvereh corrupt the
electoral process.
When online voting takes place at designat
ed polling areas, these risks aren't immediate,
lint when voting from homcoi work. thc\ are
a true cause for alarm.
Technology flaws
Bui hardware and software issues can be a
problem in any location. Civen the recent en
thusiasm for online voting, software? companies
may feel pressure to release then progianis as
cjiiie kly as possible and chance; leaving in unde
tected bugs and gliu lies.
Distributing Hawed software is standard in
the industry; operating systems are alvvavs a< i-

ing up and programs are al
ways crashing. We've learned
lo accept this as a matter ol
course, l)iit such patchiness
just doesn't wash when it
comes to the vole.
Related problems arose in
Arizona's online primary. In
addition to Y2K glitches, cer
tain browsers couldn't display
the Wei) site, the software
failed on many Ma< intosh
computers, and online traffic
jams blocked access.
Voter discrimination
I he fear of voter disc rimi

concern about the digital di

than half of Americ an house

group that researches elec

Arizona's online primary.

against minorities and the poor, groups that
are less likch to have Internet access at home.
I he government could never entirely phase
oiii public polling places while there remain c it -
izens without home-based Internet access.
However, poor and ininorit) voters who did
not enjoy the benefits of web-based voting
might be less likely to cast a ballot at all in an I n
lei net-dominated election.
Furthermore, online elections could dis
criminate against those without fundamental
computer skills, a problem magnified during
Arizona's primary, when many more online
voters had trouble understanding the site than
had been anticipated.
Devaluation of political participation
Moving voting from a public place lo home
or work could c hange the way people vote.
I he person who cast s a ballot from home or
work might not enjoy total privacy or might leel
pressure lo vole a certain way. In addition, if
voting is spread out over several clays and can
be taken care ol with one hand while wielding a
cell phone ot sleeting wheel in the other, the
Flection Day vole could lose its nivstkjue and
become, well, too easy.

new petition to forward to my senator or con
gressman. 1 ( an easily forward it to Washington
without bothering to research the issue or being
strongly committed to the cause. This kindoflie
haviot is bound to depreciate the value of politi
cal speech. If expressing a political stance be
comes too easy, will that expression lose its impact
lor the communicator as well as for the receiver?
Benefits of online voting
Risks notwithstanding, the benefits of online
voting are obvious, foremost is the almost-cer
tain outcome of increasing voter turnout, sim
|>lv because 1 lit- comparative ease of voting
would be so great.
Online voting seems guaranteed to attract
young, Internet-savvy voters, who currently
constitute the age group with the lowest voter
turnout. Fewer than forty percent of IS- to 24-
\ear-olds are even registered, and less than half
of 2 I- to 34-year-olds are registered.
I he system would simplify voting for Ameri
< ans with disabilities.
In addition, there are benefits for the state in
implementingonline voting, including reduced
printing and administrative costs. Moreover,
tallying votes would be far easier and swifter, not
to mention more accurate.
()nline voting would be a useful vehicle for
absentee voters. The Federal Voting Assistance
Pr< (gram's use of online voting in this year's elec
tion suggests as much. The Program allowed
residents living abroad to vote online through
the Department of Defense's secure network.
I lie response from voters was very favorable;
the system bypassed many of the difficulties
overseas voters often experience in procuring
absentee ballots. I here were no reports of sig
nificant problems.
I he numbers ol absentee voters are rising; in
II us v ear's election, absentee voters represented
nearlv a quarter of all voters, and forty percent of
(.alilornia voters. Yet absentee ballots often cre
ate obstacles to a smooth voting process which
could be remedied if the votes were cast online.
Absentee ballots lake a long time to count
.iihl can delay reporting of results, especially in
si,ties that require ballots to be postmarked, not
ret eived, by the date of the election. And some
< 111 k s claim llwit absentee voting favors Rcpub
li( ,uiv since the largely Republican middle ( lass

is more likely to bother with absentee ballots
than Democratic-leaning lower-income
groups.
The status quo
But docs the current election system meet
the standards of integrity and privacy that we
lear niigfn be jeopardized by online voting?
Sure, digital signatures may not perfectly en
sure the idem itv of a voter, but is ibis anv less
insurance than we have now?
I'd hardly call the authentication process in
our current system rigorous. When I went to
vote, no one even asked me for ID. All I need
ed was my signature, and I suspect that inv sig
nature would be pretty easy to falsify.
After voting, I handed niv punched ballot
to the person who checked me in, who, had she
wanted to, could easily have taken note of liovv
I'd voted. She chopped niv ballot into a card
board box with a slit in the top, as il I were par
ticipating in a high school election. 1 don't know
what happened to niv ballot altei I left, bin il was
a little disquieting to know that my vote was
being driven off in a makeshift container to have
its holes counted.
II it were up to me, I tl install a svsteni where
citizens voted online over se< lire networks from
the polling plates we use now. I would discard
the current system, and I would bar online vot
ing over i lie Internet—at le.isi for the time being.
It's an ideal compromise. We would be im
mune to the threats ol sabotage and simple
human error that plague both our current svs
teni and the Internet. We would avoitl the po
tentially discriminating consequences of allow
ing people to vote from home. And we would
preserve the aura of seriousness thai surrounds
the vote.
| usi iliink how ilie prolonged problems ol
11iis year's election might have been avoided In
a system that didn't rely on the accuracv of chads
and that tallied all voles immediatelv on the
same day.
Our experiences to date with online voting
point to this conclusion. An online voting s\s
lem that used a closed network would avoid Ari
zona's problems and reproduce the successes ol
the Federal Voting Assistance Program.
('.iven the flaws in the current system and t lie
risks inherent in the Internet, I look forward i<>
the dav when I can vole online from the polling
l)(>ot 11.

Online voting seems guaranteed to attract
young, Internet-savvy voters, who currently

In addition, there are benefits for the state in

could be remedied if the votes were cast online.

Sure, digital signatures may not perfectly en

I'd hardly call the authentication process in

After voting, I handed niv punched ballot
