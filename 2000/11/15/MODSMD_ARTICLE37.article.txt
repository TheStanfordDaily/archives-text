# Are we ready for online voting?

### ABIGAIL PHILLIPS 
As a first-lime Silicon Valley
voter, I was looking forward to .1
high-tech extravaganza at the
polling booth. 1 used to he regis
tered in New York ( it\. which uses
those clunky, curtained booths that
operate like old-lashionecl eleva
tors. You stand in front of a podi
um of switches that correspond i<>
candidates. When you finish
"switching", you drag <i level below
the switchboard, and voila! your
vote is registered.
Solas! 1 uesday, when I w,is ush
ered into a room of open c arrels,
handed a paper ballot, and told 10
punch, 1 was truly astonished.
What's the story with this antedilu
vian system? While this year ma\
have been revolutionary in terms ol
Internet campaigning, widespread
online voting still seems lobe a long
wav off.

I his year saw America's first
dalliance with legally valid online
voting. During Arizona's presidential prima
ry in March, the Democratic Partv gave mem
bers llie option of c asting their ballots online.
And on flection Day, the federal Voting As
sistance Program held online elections in lour
states for residents living abroad. In the clays
leading up to November 7th, several slates in
cluding California ran experiments with on
line voting.
Voters in San Diego, San Mateo, Sacramen
to, and ('ontra (losta participated in mock elec -
tions In submitting ballots over a closed net
work from PCs at designated locations. Ballots
were encrypted and dispatched to a remote
server, where state officials used a special kev to
decrypt the results and count the votes.
I he feedback from participants in the trials
was overwhelmingly positiveâ€”both for ease ol
use and interest in future use. While the Cali
fornia votes were not legally valid, the experi
ments anticipate a day when they might be.
Still, it's going to be a while before we're cast
ing ballots from our laptops in the middle of
class. Civen voting's fundamental role in our
democracy, no one would hasten to tinker with
the vote in a way that could jeopardize its in
tegrity. At present, the potential hazards ol on
line voting are simply too great to c hance, and
we have some distance to go bclbre the dangers

are eradicated.
Perceived risks of online voting are imper
fect sec urity, technology llaws, voiei cliscrimi
nation along the digital divide, and devaluation
of political participation.
Imperfect security
Fraud is a chief seem it \ concern with online
voting. Current security and encr\ption mea
sures aren't strong enough to guarantee voiei
integrity and voter privacy against elec ire>ni< .il
iac ks. We have no reliable means of prole* ting
ballots or ensuring that no one's vole is I rat ked.
Kven viruses and server crashes inn elated to at
tacks on the vote could scvereh corrupt the
electoral process.
When online voting takes place at designat
ed polling areas, these risks aren't immediate,
lint when voting from homcoi work. thc\ are
a true cause for alarm.
Technology flaws
Bui hardware and software issues can be a
problem in any location. Civen the recent en
thusiasm for online voting, software? companies
may feel pressure to release then progianis as
cjiiie kly as possible and chance; leaving in unde
tected bugs and gliu lies.
Distributing Hawed software is standard in
the industry; operating systems are alvvavs a< i-

ing up and programs are al
ways crashing. We've learned
lo accept this as a matter ol
course, l)iit such patchiness
just doesn't wash when it
comes to the vole.
Related problems arose in
Arizona's online primary. In
addition to Y2K glitches, cer
tain browsers couldn't display
the Wei) site, the software
failed on many Ma< intosh
computers, and online traffic
jams blocked access.
Voter discrimination
I he fear of voter disc rimi
nation coincides with recent
concern about the digital di
vide. Currently, slightly less
than half of Americ an house
holds are online. I he Voting
Integrity Project, a nonprofit
group that researches elec
toral rights, filed suit to stop
Arizona's online primary.

claiming discritninat ion
against minorities and the poor, groups that
are less likch to have Internet access at home.
I he government could never entirely phase
oiii public polling places while there remain c it -
izens without home-based Internet access.
However, poor and ininorit) voters who did
not enjoy the benefits of web-based voting
might be less likely to cast a ballot at all in an I n
lei net-dominated election.
Furthermore, online elections could dis
criminate against those without fundamental
computer skills, a problem magnified during
Arizona's primary, when many more online
voters had trouble understanding the site than
had been anticipated.
Devaluation of political participation
Moving voting from a public place lo home
or work could c hange the way people vote.
I he person who cast s a ballot from home or
work might not enjoy total privacy or might leel
pressure lo vole a certain way. In addition, if
voting is spread out over several clays and can
be taken care ol with one hand while wielding a
cell phone ot sleeting wheel in the other, the
Flection Day vole could lose its nivstkjue and
become, well, too easy.
