# SLAC group delves into antimatter
## 
### CHARLES FENG PHIL MERKSAMER 
11 it* Baßar group of the Stan
lord Linear Accelerator Center is
pursuing research into antimatter
to answer two fundamental ques
tions: l irst, why is the universe
seeniingh only composed of mat
ter and not a mixture of matter
.iiid antimatter? Secondly, Why is
there am matter in the universe at
all?
Antimatter is exactly the same
.is matter except for one important
diflerence: its charge. Charge is a
vectoi quantity, which means that
it lias a magnitude and a direction.
I lie charge of a matter particle
and.in antimatter particle are
equal in magnitude hut opposite in
direction. For example, the elec
tron and t lie position make a mat
ter-antimattei pair. They have the
same mass and size but opposite
charges. I he electron is negative
and the positron is positive.
Scientists theorize that during
the Big Bang, an explosion ofen
erg\ created equal amounts of
matter and antimatter. Microsec
onds latei. as the universe cooled,
matter and antimatter should have
annihilated each other completely,
leaving no matter or antimatter in
the universe. There is still a signif
icant quantity of matter left in the
universe, so something else must
have been going on microseconds
altet the Big Bang. Scientists oiler
two explanations:
1-irst o| all. antimatter may
de< a\ faster than matter. This
means that, in the nanosecond
,liter the Big Bang, but before the
universe was cold enough lor the
antimatter-matter annihilations to
occur, some antimatter would
have already decayed, leaving
more matter than antimatter to
undergo annihilation.
Alternately, antimatter may
transform into matter faster than

mailer transforms into matter.
(Yes, antimatter and matter can
somehow switch sides.) 1 his would
mean that, belbre the universe was
cold enough lor annihilation,
there would be more matter than
antimatter, so th.it, alter annihila
tion, some matter would be lelt.
I he Baßar group is studying
the rate of decay ol the bottom
quark, otherwise known as the B
panicle, and its antimatter part
ner, the anti-B particle. lit hey can
determine that the anti-B particle
decays faster, they may be able to
explain why we only lind matter m
the universe.

1 his experiment is arduous to
carry out due to the dillic ultv in
obtaining B-particles and creating
the anti-B particles with Sl.Ad's
panicle accelerators. S<> far, the
group has no <oik lnsive evidence.
"It just doesn't allc|iiiie lit, hut
we've just started," said Profes
sor David llitlm of the Baßar
group. " There are exciting pos
sibilities. We often make
progress iu science when theo
retical predictions are not borne
out by experiments."
At the moment, there are no
practical applications that would
result from the outcome ol the

experiments.
"This is purely for fundamental
knowledge," said Doug Thiessen,
a graduate student working with
the Baßar group. "Without the
basic science, you can't have the
applications."
Stanford physic ists aren't the
only ones puzzling over Band
anti-B particles. A competing
group ol scientists at KKk, a
Japanese laboratory, are also try
ing to explain the nature ol the B
and anti-B particles. I hough the
two groups don't share data,
they clo serve as c hecks for one
anot her.

"There is some sense ol .1 race,
but 11 is delinilelx .1 health\ one.
We communic ate with ea< li othei
in a genilctnanh wax. I liilin said.
In spile of lhe 1 ivalrx. s( ienlisls
of both groups are proceeding
with caution.
"Everything is being done ver\
carefully. In liict, it is good to have
competition," I hiessen stated.
Both the SI A( and KEK |>li\ si
cists presented their preliminary
findings at a recent meeting in
Osaka, Japan, and there are deli
nite signs ol progress towards un
derstanding ratesol deca\ and the
overall nature of antimatter.
