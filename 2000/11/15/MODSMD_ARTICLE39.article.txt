l.ver wish vou could access your

\\ itli e24 7, now vou can. Iliecom
pan\ oilers an innovative Web-based
service that allows users ,t< cess to peo
ple, information and content from any
I'd or Mac without having to down
load any additional software.
"\\ hat we've found is that more and
more people are becoming interested
in digital entertainment, like MP.'Vs,"
said tlhiel Marketing OHicer Martin
Bishop. "In the past, [individuals! have
used e-mails pi imarilv to send text let
ters, but now the\ have the option of
sending digital 'packages.'
1 his is also true lor Staniord stu
dents,' said Bishop. "Man) students
enjov J Ml'.'is] but the problem is one of
portability. "
Sophomore Will Robinson dis
agrees, saving, "There have been
man) sites like this in the past. You can
only store about 30 Ml'.'Vs online any
wa\ .And il vou want to access a paper
across campus, \<>u can just use vour
network space. I wouldn't find it very
useful."
Other Web sites oiler free storage
spat e to net users. Winamp.com gives
users 3(iß ol storage space — reserved
exclusively lot MlV'is — and Mv
space.coni advertises a free 300 MB
storage locker.
I lie dillerence between these sites
and e24/7 is e-mail: using e24/7, a per
son is able to send a large lile or multi
ple liles to a friend without sharing his
or her entire locker.
According t<» the compativ's press
release, e I J4/7 is the lirst service to com
bine wideh used and rapidly growing
Internet services such as e-mail, stor
age, and streaming video into a user-
IriendK distribution platform, called
lhe Digital 1 lub.
In addition, the siie's music and

video manager features enable users to
store music and video files, create per
sonal playlists and stream audio and
video liles directly from their private
accounts.
"We're extremely excited by the
endless possibilities of thee 24/7 web
site," said ('.hairman and (!K() Kdward
Yu. "We've developed the set ure, and
centralized Digital Hub that will
change the way people access and
enjoy their digital communications
,ui(l entertainment endeavors on the
Internet.
"e24/7 users will be able to e-mail,
store and stream large liles all [on] one
Web site, rather than two or three," Yu
added. "And most important, it's free."
I'he c 24/7 site also claims to
offer users the ability to send and
receive liles larger than those of its
competitors.
"e24/7 is sort ol like a supercharged
e-mail system," said Bishop. "With
other Web-based e-mail services, such
as Yahoo or 1 lotmail, storage space is
actuallv quite limited: onlv about (i
MB.
"What we oiler is free integrated e
mail with 100 MB ol storage space and
the ability to transler tiles up to 25
M B," Bishop said. "So, altogether, it's a
new proposition."
e24/7 Inc. is a privately owned com
pany based in Santa Monica founded
in 1909 by Yu and his brother, Irving.
As an investment banker, Kdward Yu
frequently traveled from New York to
Los Angeles and Asia, .ill the while
hampered by the luggage he had to
carry around with him.
"Kd didn't like having to cart his
laptop, liles, presentations and (ID col
lection around with him, among other
things," said Bishop. "So lie thought it
would be a good idea to store his mate
rials online so he could check it any
where [without having to carry it |."
But after a long search, Yu found
no service that met all his needs, in
spiring him to create e24/7.
