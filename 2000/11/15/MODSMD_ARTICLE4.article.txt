TALLAIIASSFE, Ma. (AP) — Florida's top
elections ollicial announced yesterday night
that lexas (iov. Ceorge VV. Bush holds a 300
vote lead ovei Vi< e President Al ('.ore based on
certified returns submitted b\ .ill 07 comities.
She s.i it I she would consider updated submis
sions later from three counties where the vice
president has requested manual recounts.
()ne week aliei the election. Republican Set -
retan of State Kathcrine Harris said Bush has
2.910.492 voles and ('.ore has 2,910.192 — a
dillerent e ol exactly !W0 votes out of (i million
cast. An unknown additional number «>t over
seas absentee ballots remain to be counted by
Frida\ night. 11 arris added.
The unofficial tally by Flie Associated Press,
which includes some hand counts, showed
Bush with a 28fi-vote lead.
Karen Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman, re
sponded sliarph to the prospect ol additional
vote counting.
"If thev go l<mvard, these I)eniocralic coun
ties are no long recounting. the\ are reinvent
ing.' she said.
" I he voles in Morida have now been count
ed and (iovernor Bush won. I liey've been re
counted and (iovernor Bush won. I lie coun
ties have now certified their votes to the Sec re
tan ol Slate and again (iovernor Bush won.
Yet it appears we may have a deadline that may
not be respected as a deadline at all."
Core spokesman Doug I lattawa\ said, "Sev
eral counties are proceeding lo count their

votes .md the secretary ol stale should meet her
responsibiliix to accept those votes before she
certifies the election."
1 lours after <i Florida judge issued a compli
cated ruling on the controversy, I larrissaid her
office was requiring oll'u i.ils in Broward, Palm
Beat hand Miami-Dade counties lt> explain the
"facts and circumstances" that support their
desire Io proceed with manual recounts. She set
a deadline at 2 p.m. today lor the counties to
reply.
Harris declined to field questions from re
porters, acting, siie said, on the advice of attor
neys. In a sign ol the tensions that underlie the
unsettled presidential elect it in, uniformed slate
oflicers were visible at the foot of the dais where
she annouiK ed the results of the canvass of all
07 counties.
I lie st,lie is critical lo determining the win
ner of the 2000 presidential election. By win
ning the state, either Bush or (it ire would cross
the 270 vote threshold needed to fashion a ma
jority in the Flet toral (lollege.
In addition lo Broward, Miami-Dade and
Palm Beach counties, officials in Volusia (loun
ty completed a hand ret tiuni shortly lie fore the
secretary ol state's deadline. It provided (lore
with a net gain of 98 votes.
Before completing their count, county offi
cials there appealed Lewis' ruling to a mid-level
Florida appeals court with the expectation that
the stale's highest court, the Florida Supreme
Court, would hear it.

A spokeswoman for Harris said she would
consider late filings, but ii was un< lear what cri
teria she might use.
At issue were recounts by human eyes and
hands that Democrats hoped would turn up
more voles for (iorc in the aftermath of the un
resolved Nov. 7 election that has tome down lo
who wins Florida's 25 electoral voles.
Keeping the count going "was our principal
objective in bringing thai case," said former
( hairof'the Stanford Board of Trustees Warren
(ihristopher, a (iore adviser. "We are counting
tin the lour counties lo move ahead with their
hand counts in accordance with this decision."

TALLAIIASSFE, Ma. (AP) — Florida's top
elections ollicial announced yesterday night
that lexas (iov. Ceorge VV. Bush holds a 300
vote lead ovei Vi< e President Al ('.ore based on
certified returns submitted b\ .ill 07 comities.
She s.i it I she would consider updated submis
sions later from three counties where the vice
president has requested manual recounts.
()ne week aliei the election. Republican Set -
retan of State Kathcrine Harris said Bush has
2.910.492 voles and ('.ore has 2,910.192 — a
dillerent e ol exactly !W0 votes out of (i million
cast. An unknown additional number «>t over
seas absentee ballots remain to be counted by
Frida\ night. 11 arris added.
The unofficial tally by Flie Associated Press,
which includes some hand counts, showed
Bush with a 28fi-vote lead.
Karen Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman, re
sponded sliarph to the prospect ol additional
vote counting.
"If thev go l<mvard, these I)eniocralic coun
ties are no long recounting. the\ are reinvent
ing.' she said.
" I he voles in Morida have now been count
ed and (iovernor Bush won. I liey've been re
counted and (iovernor Bush won. I lie coun
ties have now certified their votes to the Sec re
tan ol Slate and again (iovernor Bush won.
Yet it appears we may have a deadline that may
not be respected as a deadline at all."
Core spokesman Doug I lattawa\ said, "Sev
eral counties are proceeding lo count their

votes .md the secretary ol stale should meet her
responsibiliix to accept those votes before she
certifies the election."
1 lours after <i Florida judge issued a compli
cated ruling on the controversy, I larrissaid her
office was requiring oll'u i.ils in Broward, Palm
Beat hand Miami-Dade counties lt> explain the
"facts and circumstances" that support their
desire Io proceed with manual recounts. She set
a deadline at 2 p.m. today lor the counties to
reply.
Harris declined to field questions from re
porters, acting, siie said, on the advice of attor
neys. In a sign ol the tensions that underlie the
unsettled presidential elect it in, uniformed slate
oflicers were visible at the foot of the dais where
she annouiK ed the results of the canvass of all
07 counties.
I lie st,lie is critical lo determining the win
ner of the 2000 presidential election. By win
ning the state, either Bush or (it ire would cross
the 270 vote threshold needed to fashion a ma
jority in the Flet toral (lollege.
