## Stanford's Pande group tackles the next stage of the Human Genome Project 
### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
In i lie beginning ol I lie year, Cclera an
nounced ii had completed mapping ol the
human genome. Since genes code lor amino
acids, whit Ii are the building blocks ol proteins,
and proteins ailed virtual!) all life processes,
this was <i vital st ietitilic leap.
lint just knowing genes is like having a list ol
parts lor a car but not knowing how they are as
sembled into a vehicle. Understanding what
genes code lor which proteins is the next —and
more difficult — challenge.
Proteins are unique in that thev Ibid auto
maticallv. what is known as self-assembly. I he
resulting !M) strut lure, or conformation, is the
key to the protein's function. As enzymes, iliey
drive I>i<>t hcmical reactions in the both. As an
tibodies. they recognize disease and oilier for
eign bodies and help the immune svsteni elimi
nate them.
I ndcrstanding how proteins sell-assemble is
key to understand what goes wrong in a genet
ic disease. From that, treatments, and even a
cure, can be devised.
Considering there are millions of possibili
ties lor each ol the 100.000 proteins in the
human body, current technology is slill inade
quate lor a single computer to determine elli
t ienib what shape a particular amino acid se
quent e will lake.
Vi jit) Pande, an associate professor of chem
istry, believes he has ;i 11 answer. I"he Stanford
based research unit, Pande (iroup, proposes to
concert idle computing power of Internet users
around the world towards ibis task. I sers
would run simulations ol protein self-assembly
and send data to I lie main lab.
I Ins st rat eg) ol using the masses is similar to
the tine used b\ M I I (a I lomeand 112 miopia. Vol

unteers for SK I I, lor instance, analyze radio fre
quencies data from telescopes around the world
to deled a possible alien transmission.
" I Ins is a great computational problem in
computational biology, where simulations run
1.000 to 10,000 limes slow|erJ" than the rate at
which proteins self-assemble], Pande ex
plained. "We tame up with a way to use mail)
computers lo stud) this problem thai could
use 1,000 computers to potentially see a 1,000
limes speed up, but then we had It) find 1.000
computers."
As Pande explained to "Wired," simple pro
teins assemble in about 10,000 nanoseconds.
()nc computer running at 400 Ml 1/ can simu
late one nanosecond of assembly time in about
a day. Ibis means 1,000 participants would be
needed to simulate a simple protein folding in
1 0 days. And that's just for simple ones — com
plex proteins would take mut Ii longer.
()n Sept. 10, flic Pande Croup released the
Home program, designed lo run sim
ulations ol how proteins assemble themselves.
I he software can be used on PC Is running Win
dows oi Linux.
I he software used lo develop the service is
called the Milhral Client-Server SDK. Pande
could not discuss the details of how fold-
I lonic works because ii is currently under
s< ietiti lie peer review. Peer rey lew is essential in
the scientific community because ii means other
scientists have approved the idea.
I nder the current pat e ol development, ex
perls predict that unraveling the gcnc-proicin
connection will start bearing flint within the
next 10 years.
fliis is ,ui interesting academic question,
with potentially important applications lo pro-
Icin-niisiolding diseases (such as Mad Cow or
Alzheimer's) as well as nanolet luiologv," Pande
said.
Nanotct luiologv is the let luiologv Ibi work
ing at very small scales, like sy nlhesi/ing a com
pound at the inolet ulai level.
"People seem lo be really excited about protein
folding, probably due lo its importance and rele
vant e to the Human ( ient >tne Project," Pande said.
