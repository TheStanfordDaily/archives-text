I low many limes have you un

pornography on the Net? Very
likely, at least oik e or twice. ()n a

Anna Kuornikova, hall ol the re
turned links were pornography.
In fact, Irom the responses ol stu

campus, it is impossible not i<>

II even computer-savvy adults
cannot avoid online smut, imagine
the difliculty children lace, espe
cially as the Net becomes as popu
lar as the television or video
games.
I lie challenge prompted some
concerned adults to ask lor Inter
net regulation In the government,
rejected b\ theSupremeClourt last

A more realisti< goal, in the
emerging consensus, is not to try
make the Net kid-safe, but to cre

"Many of the |( hild-protet tion|

inadequate," he said.
Besides, "thecosts in setting up
a pornographic Web site are

The solution, according to
him, is to create a kid-safe "green

for everything that falls in be

would be monitored by an indus
