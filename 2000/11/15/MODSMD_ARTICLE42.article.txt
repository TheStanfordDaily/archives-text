I lie sludv of morality lias nevei enjoyed ilie same scientific le
gitimacy a I lorded lo lit* 1< Is sue li as | > h \ sics 01 chemistry. And. yet.
recent findings in both biology and anthropology suggest morali
ty arises as much from our physiological roots as out religious
ones.
During an Kthi< s ai Noon lecture last week. Lecturer William
I lut II)ut, of tlie Stanford Human Biology Program, offered "not a
proof ol morality, hut an explanation;" one grounded firmly in
science rat her than philosophy.
I lurlhul began Ins lecture with a brief assertion: "anthropolo
gy has traditionally overemphasized cultural differences. . . New
studies suggest .ill humans share a striking similarity in the ability
to empathize, in t ognitive and perceptive strategies and in I lie dy
namics ol personal exchanges." I hesc similarities allow a funda
mental examination ol the development ol ccrtain trails during
human evolution.
I he most important of these trails, empathy, "the ability to
identify with and understand tlu- feelings and motivations of oth
ers," fundamentally lies personal desires to moral constraints and,
heme, allows moral development.
Kmpath) first arose with the development ol the human face.
As the sloping, elongated jaw and snout of out hoininid ancestors
recessed into the more compact structure we know todav, com
plex facial expressions emerged. With over !i() "finely'-tuned"
muscles, the lace tame to be "a canvas lot sell-presentation."
(Combined with the development of sight, facial expressions al
lowed our ancestors to display their emotions and read the emo
tions ol others. Long belore the development of language, the
human lace rendered subtleties and complex feelings wholl\
apart from any other species.
flic importance of facial features < an be readily observed in the
interplay between an infant and hei mother. As soon as lib hours
after birth, a child can mimic the lii< ial features ol hei parents, du
plicating .it least superficially the emotions of another person.
One particularly compelling study, described by I lurlhul in the
let lute, involved a mother who feigned a look of sadness and de

pression in front ol her child. I lie voung how sensing his moth
er's distress, attempted to, in I urn, district I he mot her with a sock
puppet, look consolingly into the mother's eyes and give the
mot her a hug.
i he lace, therefore, allowed the development ol 'more complex
interpersonal exchanges. With these exchanges came the need lot
more complex adaptive strategies. As the relations among hu
mans changed, these strategies laid the groundwork lor the
growth of a moral order.
Ilurlhut speculates that the development of the imagination,
along with em pat liy, played a kc\ role in human ev< >lut ion and the
creation ol morality. "Imagination, the ahilitv to calculate, com
bine and project, allows us to construct a possible future apart
Irom the immediacy of the present environment," I lurlbut said.
I his "in< rease in freedom demands an increase in the control
of freedom," forcing humans to control and modulate their re
sponses to others, By pla\ ing out thousands ol possible scenarios
in their minds, as people do in davdreaming, our ancestors could
evaluate the effects ol lheit actions on themselves and others. Per
sonal ex< hanges thus migrated towards the- empirical realm; be
havior could be planned, tested and evaluated.
And, yet, I lut lbut observes, these crucial developments were
not cons< iotisb "created" by an evolving human species. I hev oc
curred because "life is driven, not by our awareness of evolution
ary ends, but by our desires." 1 hese desires ultimatelv gave rise to
the physiological conditions allowing empathic and moral rela
tions within human communities. Klevating the importance <>l
human desires, 1 lurlbut believes, < an "free us from determinism"
and create a picture ol the human mind tli.it is predicated ulti
matelx on our empathic exchanges with others.
li\ separating the biological emergence of morality from the
more limited idea of an "intellectual" morality. 1 1urlbut coin lud
ed his lecture on a more optimistic note. As we search fora moral
order in the universe, we must ta< itl\ recognise the tremendous
uniqueness of human development. According to I lurlbut, a
moralitN th.it emerges lock-step with our own evolution can in
spire nothing short of awe in the "cosmic mat let that has come to
consciousness.'
