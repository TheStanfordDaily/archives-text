A laser printer for
the price of an inkjet?
Cool. Just $199.
Now you can have your very own laser
printer. At a breakthrough price.
Fast. Sharp. Clean. Compact. With
a toner cartridge that should last you all
year. And at a per page cost that's 70%
less than inkjet. Plus a Toner Save button
that extends the life another 30%.
Papers that stand out in a teacher's
grading stack. Professional resumes.
Articles fit to submit for publication. All for
the price of a half-dozen inkjet cartridges.
Better think twice. Everyone in the
dorm's gonna want to use it.
Grab one at your campus bookstore.
Order online. Or by phone at 800-459-3272.
Go to www.samsungusa.com/Xtreme for
more information.
