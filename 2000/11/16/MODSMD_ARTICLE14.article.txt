It \s hard to say who Anna Deavere
Smith is.
She's an actress. She's a writer. She
has received a Mac Arthur Foundation
" genius"grant, earned a Tony Award
nomination, taught at Stanford Uni
versity and received a prestigious fel
lowship for writers, artists and politi
cians in Bellagio, Italy. . . .
'As Sam Donaldson said to me,
' You're an actress, hut you 're really se
rious about social issues,' " Smith
says with a wry smile. . . .
"As if the two things are never sup
posed to meet. People think of actors
as frivolous movie stars. Hut a lot of
the movie stars I know are pretty seri
ous people, too."
â€” from the Nov. 1 2 issue of
The Atlanta Journal and Constitution
