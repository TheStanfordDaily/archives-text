### 
GAZA (TFY,( laza Strip (AP) —
Israeli soldiers killed eight Pales
tinians in bitter ( lashes yesterday,
the highest death toll in neatly a
month. I here were no celebra
tions to mark what Palestinians see
as their symbolic independence
day — only more funerals and
more violence.
Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, who had promised his peo
ple independence this year, avoid
ed mention ol the anniversary, but
other prominent Palestinians said
the) would not stop lighting until
they have a state.
The intense lighting was a sad
contrast to the funeral of Leah
Rabin, widow of Prime Minister
Yii/hak Rabin. The Israeli leader
was assassinated live years ago by a
Jewish extremist who opposed his
peace initiatives. Mrs. Rabin died
Sunday of cancer.
First lady I lillary Rodham (Clin
ton — the newly elected U.S. sena
tor from New York — headed a list
of dignitaries and ambassadors at
the funeral, but no Arab leaders at
tended. Mrs. Rabin was a peace ac
tivist in her own tight, carrying on
her husband's drive for an end to
the Israel-Arab conflict.
In what appeared to be ages

ture to the Israeli people, Arafat
gave a videotaped eulogy that was
broadcast on Israeli television. I le
said, "I put with all the respects a
flower from Palestine on your cof
fin. renewing my commitment lot
peace." The eulogy was not broad
cast on Palestinian television.
But exchanges ol gunfire, not
talk of peace, set the lone vesterdav.
" I lie politic al rhetoric has been
replaced by field action," Palestini
an spokeswoman ll,man Aslnawi
said in apparent relcrence to re
cent Palestinian ambushes of Is
raeli soldiers and settlers on toads
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
"In a sense, the arm) of occupa
tion and the settlers have become
legitimate and select targets of
Palestinian resistance," she said.
Arafat emerged brielh from his
seaside ollice in (laza (lit\ to make
a terse plea lor the international
community to "push the peace
process Ibrward."
Arafat lias repeatedly pledged
this year would bring Palestinian
sovereignty, but the c urrent hostili
ty has eliminated anv c hance of a
negotiated settlement lor now. lie
has also backed away from unilater
ally declaring an independent slate.
Israel, which suspended peace

talks amid the violence, said n
would not resume negotiations
until c aim is restored.
"We are in the middle of a
march of lolly, and ibis tragic situ
ation needs to be brought to an
end," said Israeli foreign Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami.
I he anniversary came as Israel
enforced a tight bloc kade of Pales
tinian communities fora second
clay yesterday, paralyzing normal
life in the West Bank and (laza.
As the c risis dragged on, Presi
dent (.linton said his biggest regret
ma\ be his inabilit\ to reconcile Is
rael .uid the Palestinians.
"I realh wanted with all my
heart to finish the ... peace pro
cess," Clinton said in Brunei,
where he was attending an eco
nomic summit.
Fight Palestinians were shot
and killed yesterday b\ Israeli
forces — two at the Kami crossing
between Israel and Gaza, two in
the West Bank town ol I ulkarem,
one each in I lebron, (.)alc|ilva, Jeri
cho and (enin, doctors said, after
(lashes that featured Palestinian
rock-throwing, firebombs and
gunshots. Israeli forces responded
with rubber-coated bullets and live
lire.

in areas under his control as Israel warned that its patience was running out after weeks of deadly violence that has
blazed across the Palestinian territories.
