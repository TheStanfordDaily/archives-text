# Fed encouraged by economy, maintains rates

WASHINGTON (Al») — The Federal
Reserve, encouraged that ihe record -
breaking economy is slowing to a more
sustainahle bul still healthy pace, decided
yesterday against raising interest rates.
A key rate* controlled by the Fed, called
the federal funds rate, will stay at f>.s per
cent. the highest level in nine years. The
lunds rale is the interest that banks charge
each other on overnight loans.
Instead of being cheered by the no
rate-increase stance, investors apparently
were upset by the Fed's indication that it
was not closing the door to future increas
es. The Dow Jones industrial average,
which was up 113 points when the Fed an

nounced its decision, plunged 90 points
within IT) minutes. I lie Dow recovered
some ground, narrowing its loss to around
15 points in afternoon trading.
The central bank's decision came after
the end of a closed-door meeting ol the
Federal ()pen Market (lommittee, the of
ficials, including Fed Ghairman Alan
Greenspan, who set interest rate policy.
The outcome had been widely expec t
ed by private economists, especially with
the uncertainty surrounding the presi
dential election, which has given Wall
Street one more thing to worry about.
It marked the fourth meeting in a row
in which the Fed passed up tlu- chance to

raise rates anothei time 1 his year. I lie led
It'll interest rales unchanged at its |nne,
August and ()< toher meetings, < iting signs
ol moderating economic growth.
In a statement explaining its decision
yesterda\. the Fed said increased energy
prices still raise inflation dangers down the
road. But the Fed also noted a "softening
in business and household demand."
In the part of the statement that rellecis
possible future moves, the < entral bank left
the (loot open to further rate increases.
I'he fed said it believes the risks continue
to be "weighted mainh toward conditions
tli.it ma\ generate heightened inflation
pressures in the foreseeable future."

I he l ed said it is still concerned about
tight labor markets and rising energy
prices, saying they threaten "the possibili
ty ol raising inflation expectations."
Diane Swonk, chief economist for Bank
One in Ghicago, doesn't foresee the Fed
anytime soon either moving to a stance
where it would be neutral about the
prospects ol additional rate increases in
the future or easing interest rates "because
there's still a heck ola lot of cheer in this
economy."
Without a boost to the key funds rate,
commercial banks won't feel the need to
raise their prime lending rate, a bench
mark lor millions of loans, from home eq

nitv and unpaid credit card balances to
short-term loans lor businesses.
The prime rate stands at 9.5 percent, its
highest level since January 1991. when the
country was in its last recession.
Since June 1999, the Fed has raised
rates six times with the goal of bringing
about a "soli landing" — slowing eco
nomic growth enough to keep inflation
under control but not so much as to cause
a recession.
The Fed's last rate increase — by a bold
hall point — was in May. That pushed the
funds rate to ('>."> percent. In June 1999,
before the central bank started raising
rates, the funds rate stood at 1.7. r > percent.
