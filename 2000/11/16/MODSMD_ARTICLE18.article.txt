# Amtrak debuts U.S. bullet train
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — A
champagne christening in
Washington, a gala welcome in
New York and fireworks in
Boston were on track today to
celebrate the debut, at last, ol
America's first bullet train.
The VIP-only inaugural run
of Am Irak's Acela Express, how
ever, is just the first step on a
long and costly road toward Eu
ropean-style high-speed train
travel in the United States.
If the idea catches on, Amtrak
sees a bright future for itsell and
for U.S. rail travel. "Acela Ex
press is the leader of all that is yet
to mine," said Wisconsin Gov.
Pommy Thompson, chairman
of Amtrak's board of directors.
If not, Acela Express could be
iht- swan song for the federally
subsidized railway that is under
orders from Congress to become
financially self-sufficient by 2003.
Amtrak is relying on the service
to earn $180 million a year.
Proponents say high-speed
rail is needed regardless of Am
trak's future, as an alternative to
overcrowded air travel. But that
would require billions of public
dollars to lay new tracks in some
corridors, straighten curves,
eliminate highway crossings and
pet form other upgrades of the
nation's rail network.
"We've been willing to spend
billions and billions of dollars on
highways but reluctant to spend
money on the alternatives," said
Anne ('hettle, director of public af

fairs for the High-Speed Ground
Transportation Association, a
trade group in Washington.
"I lopefully, if the Acela is suc
cessful, maybe that will start to
change the attitude."
A year behind schedule,
Acela Express begins daily ser
vice in the Northeast on Dec. I 1,
with a top speed of 150 mph.
Today's debut is set to start in
Washington and end in Boston,
with a stop in New York.
Once a leader in rail travel,
the United States has fallen
decades behind other countries,
[apan's Shinkansen trains, in
troduced just before the 1964
Tokyo Olympics, regularlv hit
l<Sf> mph and have reached
maximum speeds of 275 mph in
test runs. France's TGV trains,
launched in the late 1900s, also
cruise at 180 mph.
Passenger trains in Spain,
Germany, Great Britain, Swe
den and Italy regularly exceed
100 mph. South Korea, Aus
tralia and Taiwan are develop
ing high-speed train lines.
In the United States, the top
speed for most passenger trains
outside the Northeast Corridor
— the area between Washington
and Boston where tracks have
been modernized — is 79 mph.
Acela Express operates with a
sensor-driven tilt system that al
lows the train to maintain high
speeds through curves. The
new trains will top out at 150
mph.
