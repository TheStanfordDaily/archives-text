## The 						Stanford Daily Board of Trustees could use a younger voice 
### 
Published Since 1X91

Tf\V. STANFORD BOARD of Trustees
includes a number of dynamic and pow
erful figures from the Bay Area and all
over the nation.
In the near future, the ASSU is hoping that
the Board will also include a more youthful
voice. Among the dot-comers and philan
thropists, the ASSU has proposed a new type of
trustee, one with recent experience as a student
on the Farm.
For the past 30 years, students have been trying
to gain a seat on the Board. This year, ASSU Pres
ident Seth Newton and Vice-President Malia Vil
legas could make it happen. They are fighting to
have a recent graduate (from undergraduate or
graduate studies) elected to the Board of Trustees
during the next election period.
We support their efforts not only because they
represent an attempt to broaden the range of
voices and opinions on the Board, but also be

cause we believe that a student or recent graduate
sitting on llie Board will increase its effectiveness .
Most Stanford students can hardly name one
or two trustees. Even though these are the people
who decide everything from campus expansion
to tuition increases, the average student has little
contact with the Board in their years on campus.
A younger trustee, one that may even serve a
non-voting year as a senior, would still have con
tacts on campus and may be accessible in ways the
current trustees are not.
In their proposal to Board Chair Isaac Stein,
Newton and Villegas also presented compelling
models of young trustee programs from a variety of
universities, including Stanford's peer institutions.
In researching the subject, Newton and Ville
gas found that a majority of public universities,
and several private universities such as Duke,
Princeton and Cornell, have successfully integrat
ed students and young graduates on their

Boards.
It's time for Stanford to catch up. While the de
tails of selection and appointment have yet to be
worked out, we encourage Chairman Stein and
the rest of the board to consider the benefits of
having a younger board member.
As the ASSU has argued, students have an in
depth understanding of the University that can
only come from being involved in classes and stu
dent activities.
The student perspective would be a valuable
and enlightening addition to the Board. Despite
Chairman Stein's fears of students being pre-oc
cupied with student-specific issues such as dining
halls and parking, we believe students are just as
capable of being objective as the corporate CEOs
that currently sit on the Board.
While we support the placement of a student /
young graduate trustee, we also support the
ASSU's belief that the trustee should not be an

clected position. Instead, we suggest that the
Alumni Association, Board of Trustees and Nomi
nations Committee select someone for the position
based upon criteria set forth by all three bodies.
The ASSU lias also proposed that the young
trustee spend a year as a non-voting member in
order to learn the issues facing the board. 1 his
should please the current trustees, and ensure
that the student trustee is a productive member of
the Board.
We appreciate the time and service the Board
ofTrustees puts into making important decisions
for the University. 1 lowever, we do recognize that
for too long those decisions have been missing the
necessary and valuable perspective of someone
with intimate, day-to-day knowledge of Stanford.
We applaud the ASSU for undertaking this
project and ask the Board of Trustees to support
and encourage the selection of a student / young
graduate trustee.
