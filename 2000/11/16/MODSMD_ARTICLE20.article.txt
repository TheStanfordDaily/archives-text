# SUMMARY JUDGMENT

### 
Online voting is inevitable, how
over problematic the concept
now seems. Ihe recent elec
tion difficulties highlight the
need to bring our antiquated voting sys
tem into the 21st century.
Many techies wonder why we haven't
modernized our voting system yet. Euro
pean nations like the Netherlands and
Ireland are already turning to electronic
voting systems.
However the United States — the na
tion that pioneered computers — is still

using punchcards and
"butterfly ballots."
A key reason for the
delay in digitizing the
elections is that up
grading ballot systems
from mechanical levers
to computer screens
would be expensive.
Given that voters
generally care about

ilie ballot once every two or lour years,
spending that money on newfangled vot
ing systems has not been politically
popular.
Expect that attitude to change alter this
election.
Concerns about missing ballots, count
ing accuracy, and the ability to quickly re
count ballots will lead to easier, less con
fusing and less time-consuming polling
done through computers, either at the
polling places or at home.
I he convenience of voting over the In
ternet from home — in your bathrobe, if
you like — will be the end goal.
Arizona has already tried Internet vot
ing m its Democratic primary this year,
yielding nearly three times as much par
ticipation as in its 1996 primary. Hie De
partment of Defense is experimenting
with online votes from 250 military per
sonnel stationed abroad — hopefully to
spare us the pesky wait for overseas absen
tee ballots.
True, these experiments have encoun
tered many of the predicted technological
problems. An online voting system would
be hit by a tsunami of hacker attacks, virus
es and software glitches.
Problems of authentication, privacy
and online traffic bottlenecks still persist
throughout the Internet. Even worse, the
continuing digital divide may make online
voting inherently discriminatory.
Arizona was hit with a lawsuit during
its online election, alleging discrimina
tion against the less-wired poor and mi
nority voters.
These problems inherent in online vot

int> suggest that we should locus just on
digitizing the existing polling structure.
Km the attempts in Arizona and in the
military show the direction t hat every
body is headed — we are not stopping at
merely upgrading our current system; we
are looking fora whole new election
framework.
As the Internet is continually refined,
solutions to the above problems will even
tually be found, or at least improvised.
Rather than focusing on current limits
holding up the shift to online voting, we
should look to what opportunities a new
election framework may offer.
The more immediate benefits are
voter convenience and higher turnout.
Many people don't vote because they
don't have the time, don't know where
the polls are or simply don't want to be
bothered.
As more homes and offices get wired to
the Internet, the convenience of voting at
home or at work may make even the most
busy, apathetic and lazy voter say "Why
not?" and click in his vote.
At the same time, the Internet gives vot
ers who actually care a limitless library to
research their candidates as they vote.
Traditionally, when confronted with two
unknown candidates once inside the vot
ing booth, people often choose by who has
the better sounding name. With online
voting, they can look up the policy posi
tions ol the candidates as they vote.
But within the new framework, we can
also contemplate previously impossible
options. I low about letting each person as
they vote know exactly how many votes
their candidate has received so far, with
computers tabulating real-time counts? In
the current election, that would have al
lowed Nader voters to decide whether
(lore needed their vote.
Why restrict voting to just one day?
Polling places are opened fora limited
time to keep down administrative costs,
which would be practically non-existent
with an online voting scheme.
()n the other extreme, why not have an
hour-long election? Assuming sufficient
technological infrastructure, society can
afford to grind to a halt for one hour so
that everyone can vote.
Obviously, these proposals have flaws,
but .it least now they are possibilities to
consider. Our election system has drasti
cally changed from when the Founders
originally designed it. Expect it to contin
ue changing throughout our lifetimes.
