Foothills resemble police state
This Sunday afternoon, my little sister
(a sophomore here at Stanford) and I were
walking on tin- new recreation path at the
Dish enjoying the sunny weather and
catching up. Many other families, couples
and friends were also enjoying the fresh air
with a walk, and the view of the Bay Area
was particularly beautiful set against the
huge dabs of fall clouds overhead.
I lowever, towards the end of our time,
we witnessed something very disturbing
that sent us both reeling. A little boy had
strayed from the recreation path and had
climbed a nearby oak. It was a particularly
good tree for climbing: rough, porous
bark, nobbins for handholds, low brandi
es. The boy's parents were on the path
photographing him high amidst the fo
liage and all three of them were nothing
short of gleeful, their giggles contagious to
the rest of the walkers and runners.
Soon enough, however, a Stanford
pickup truck came to a halt and an armed
officer approached the family. To their
sh(x k (and my sister's and mine), they
were presented with a ticket for trespass
ing and the little boy was asked to come
promptly down from the tree.
This incident disturbed me greatly. Is

Stanford the new police state? I think the
University should seriously reconsider the
atmosphere and values they are promot
ing with their new fences, rules, closing
and opening times, boundaries and, most
of all, armed officers who patrol this beau
tiful sanctuary which used to be my favorite
place of quiet meditation and musing.
Now we are all confined to walking in a
pre-determined circular, concrete path
with no option to stray, climb, explore or
even sit on the grass. Oh, the horror, the
horror.

Columnist exaggerated Istanbul
earthquake damage
In the Nov. 14 Daily, Matt Bentley
claims in his column ("Decisions, deci
sions: how not to write a 40-year plan")
that "a 7.4 earthquake struck Istanbul,
killing 40,000 people and leaving much of
the city in ruins."
The epicenter of the quake was 100 km
to the east of Istanbul's center. It was the
cities of Golcuk, I/.mit, Yalova and Ada
pa/ari that were devastated, but Istanbul
received minor damage, except fora cer

tain neighborhood. The ratio of the casu
alties in Istanbul to the whole should be
around 1 to 30.
1 was myself in Istanbul, my hometown,
on the day of the quake and during the fol
lowing weeks, and it was definitely not "in
ruins." Life was on its normal track as the
sun rose, except for some power outages.
I hese data should be apparent in any
news source covering the quake.
