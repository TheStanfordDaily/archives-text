# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## University dining doesn't cater to health-conscious students

Walk by Tresidder Fitness,
cruise through Arillaga or
glance at Campus Drive
around 5 p.m. and you'll get
a good feel lor liovv important getting lit
and staying healthy is 10 Stanford stu
dents.
No matter how winded we become on
the way to the Dish or how monotonous
the stairmaster seems alter the first five
minutes, our high value lor physical excel
lence justifies the sometimes excruciating
physical exertion.
Asa student body, we recogni/.e and act
upon the need to get our bodies, as well as
our minds, into great shape. However,
even if we run 30 miles a week and lilt

every day, our desire lor healthy living is
thwarted by the unhealthy nutritional
content of University dining.
Kach year, it continues to shock me how
out of touch the University's primary f<x>d
provider is with the students it feeds. My
gripe isn't based upon frustration at not
knowing what weeds comprise the goop
filled "garden brioche" or at pu//ling over
the exact species ol lish that would qualify
as a vegetarian entree. My insulin-depen
dent diabetes gives me a heightened con
cern for and awareness of nutritional con
tent t hat University dining fails to satisfy.
When I go through the dinner line, I
not only need to know what food group
each item belongs to, I need to know ex
actly how many grams of protein, carbo
hydrate and fat each item contains. In the
world of pre-packaeed. FDA-nutrition-la

beled loods, this is simple. In the dining
hall, this is impossible.
Until my freshman year, 1 enjoyed
blood sugar levels within normal range for
non-diabetics. After only three months of
eating I niversity lood. my hemoglobin
Aid test indicated that my average blood
sugar had spiked far above normal range,
despite my fanatic devotion to exercise and
my attempt at counting carbohydrates and
eating the simplest loods served.
I unsuccessfully tried to obtain nutri
tion information from University Dining
Services and was dismayed and disgusted
to learn that my dormitory's food-service
manager couldn't assist me. I met with a
dietitian at my endocrinologist's ollice,
but, without specific nutrition informa
tion, she couldn't oiler any advice but to
eat salad.

But neither I nor anyone else can live
on lettuce alone. While most students
don't share my immediate medical de
mands, Dining Services' poor food qualit\
and high lat content are detrimental to ev
eryone's health.
Ii is not unreasonable for students to
demand that Dining Services provide nu
trition details lor even dish. Although this
knowledge may be disturbing, when ii
comes to sta\ing healthv. ignorance about
what you're eating is anything but blissful.
I was very fortunate l.tst year to obtain
disability housing in I'oyon, where the
Fating ( Hubs consistent!) provided health
ier lood options and a well-stocked open
kitchen. As a result, mv hemoglobin Aid
level returned to normal. I his vear, I'm
fortunate to live in a house with a diabetic
chef as conscientious of nutrition as I, and

this has helped me maintain tight control
of my glucose.
I'm glad that the Disability Resource
(lenter was able to assist me in est aping the
horrors of University Dining, but access to
healthy food should be the standard on
campus â€” not the exception. Providing
nutritional information would at least help
health-conscious students know what
loods to avoid. Furthermore, this would
make University Dining Services belter
equipped to provide a menu in-sync with
students' tastes, nutritional needs and
healthv lifestyles.
