Because of a national ilu vac
cine shortage, Cowell Student
I lealth ( enter has been I dreed to
tin n awa\ hundreds of students
who wish to avoid c atc hing I he Ilu
during the 2000-2001 season.
Cowell Director Dr. Ira Fried
man suggested ili.it most students
should not be overh concerned
about the shortage.
"No one knows what kind of
Ilu season we will have this year,"
Friedman said. "Right now, only
high-risk students should be
concerned, and they should c 011-
ta< i our ad\ ice nurse lor more
inhumation."
I le added that other students
should wan 11 the ( owe 11 Web sue,

a notice will be posted under the

According to Friedman de
inancl for I he vac (ine lias in
< leased this vear .is compared to
last. Approximated 7.i0 flu shots
were given to students last vear.
\< ( oiding to the ( enters lor
Disease Control and Prevention,
the vaccine is specific all\ recom

mended lor members of high-risk
groups. I hese groups include all
people aged 50 years or older and
people ol any age with chronic
diseases ol' I he heart, lung or kid
neys, diabetes, immunosuppres
sion or severe lbrms ol anemia.
I lie press release did not idemil\
college students as a high-risk
group.
Although doc tors have recom
mended an annual influenza vac
cination for people in high risk
groups for quite some time, main
people still do not receive the \a< -
c ine.
I he ( D( i c ites the belief that
the vaccine is not ver\ ellec tive <is
one ol the main reasons for peo
ple's reluctance to receive it.
Vaccine effectiveness varies
from year to vear, depending on
the degree of similarity between
ilie influen/a virus strains includ
ed in the vaccine and the particu
lar strains ili.it circulate during
the inlluen/a season. Because the
vaccine strains must be chosen
nine to 10 months before the sea
son. the possibilit\ exists that mu
tations in the inlluen/a strains will
render the vaccine less effective.
I he vaccination proc ess itsell
is simple. A student can come to

(owell during designated vac cine
clinic hours, show his or her stu
dent ID. pax the lee ($ 10 lor Car
dinal Care members or $18 for
students with otliet insurance),
sign a consent Ibrm and receive a
shot in ilie <u in.
I he shortage is not limited to
(owell.
Sophomore kristen Jones ex
perienced a great deal of dillicul
i\ procuring a vaccine lor her
aged grandmother, doubly at risk
for influenza as both a senior c iti
zen and.i member ola nursing
home.
"I'm not concerned lor myself,
but this seems like a big problem
loi people w ho need the vaccine,"
she said.
In.in ()c t. (i press release, the
CI)(. staled that influenza vaccine
supplies will be distributed in sim
ilar quantities to l.isi year's. 1 low

than usual.
In light of the delavs, the (.DC

tions to vaccine providers saying
