1 leading into its final three games of
ilio regular season, the No. 21 (lardinal
(15-1 1. 8-8 Pacific 10 Conference) may
still be able to control the question of
where it will start this year's
tournament.
Stanford will finish oil its 2000 Pac
-10 season with matches against Oregon
(10-1 5, 2-14) and ()regon State (15-1 3,
5-11) tonight and tomorrow night in

close out its regular season with a piv
otal match against No. 15 Santa Clara
(24-3) on 1 uesday, also at Maples.
If Stanford wins its last three mate li
es. it lias the chance of being selected .is

rounds of the NCAA tournament,
meaning the Cardinal could pick up
home-court advantage foi its lirst two
postseason mate lies.
Hi is prospect has the team lonised
intently on the matches this weeke nd.
"We want to win the next two games
so that we can win the NCAA champi
onship and that's pretty much all that

matters at this point," said senior setter
Lindsay Kagawa, the team's captain.
"We're ready to do everything it's going
to t.ike to win this tiling."
Also on the Cardinal's mind is the
prospect ol closing out its conference
schedule with a record above .500.

lerence oil on a good note," said junior
oulside hitler Sara Sandrik.
" I his is probably the best the l'ac-10
has ever been, so we want to show that
we were on the winning side of it."
Wins over the ()regon schools would
leave the Cardinal with a 10-8 final Pac
-10 record and a likely fourth-place fin
ish in the conference,.
No. S USC. and No. 5 Arizona have
had breakthrough seasons, holding
steady near the top of the national
rankings all season, and No. 7 UCLA
has continued its role as a national vol
leyball powerhouse.
Meanwhile, Stanford has been going
through a year of rebuilding after los
ing lour members of last year's NCAA
runner-up squad.

Over the course ol the season, the
(lardinal has been integrating live new
freshmen into the team's lineup while a
couple of returning players have had
to adjust to position changes from last
year.
Although the Stanford squad has
struggled as it has taken shape this year.

it has become clear that this group lias
the power to dominate its opponents
and remains a threat to every team in
the nation heading into the postseason.
"We're much more mature and set
tled as a team than we were earlier in
the season," Sandrik said.
"We've got almost a whole season
under our belts now. 1 don't want to say
that things are set, but they feel very
good right now."
Hie Cardinal heads into the week
end 00/ ing with confidence after its
perlbrmance against (lalifbrnia last Fri
day.
The Cardinal overwhelmed the
Golden Bears 3-0 in just over an
hour, playing its strongest match of
the season.

"We always knew we could play that
way, so it's not new or surprising to us,"
kagawa said of the victory.
"But success can help lo motivate
and hopefully we can continue building
momentum this weekend."
Stanford will look to make a state
ment against ()regon and ()regon State
the next two nights.
The Cardinal defeated both teams
back in September, but Stanford strug
gled in both matches and needed five
games to win each one.
Oregon comes into tonight's
match with the weakest offense in the
Pat-10. I he Ducks are only hitting
.178 as a team for the season and are
last in the conference in kills, assists,
blocks and digs.
()regon will rely on strong serving to
throw Stanford oil its game tonight.
The Ducks tallied 15 aces against the
Cardinal in the teams' previous meet
ing, and the Oregon serving game
hampered the Cardinal's passing
throughout the match.
Tomorrow night, the Cardinal will
face a struggling Oregon Stale squad
that has been plagued by injuries. The
Beavers have lost their last seven Pat-10
matches.
Tonight's match begins at 7 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion, while tomorrow's
match starts at 7:30 p.m. Tomorrow's
