# Carey's value not in numbers

They say thai numbers
don't lie. Jamie Carey's
numbers for last year are
starkly impressive: 1 1
points per game, a school-record
HI three-pointers, .478 three-point
percentage in conference plav.
The list of her honors is long
and equally as impressive: Pacific
Ten Conference Freshman of the

Year, Honorable Mention All-Pat -10, freshman All-
America honors from basketball publications lai
and wide.
Study Jamie Carey's freshman year at Stanford lor
even a few minutes and you can see almost every
thing. The numbers, the records, the honors; they
pile up like medals fora war veteran returning home

fiut sometimes the numbers lie.
Look at the numbers long enough and they can
convince you that Carey was <i basketball player with

Stanford sports in the last few decades, and the loss is
not one of numbers and records, although they will
be missed.
What will be missed more soreh are the smallest of
touches: a head-bobbing dribble up the floor, a sud
den explosive feint to the basket, a glance across the
floor to point guard Milena Mores, on recognition of
weakness in a defense, a stuttering drive to the basket
and laser pass out to a teammate, a stare and a low
ered head, arms outstretched, daring her opponent
to try the shot she was given.
Those that watch the games see these moments
and lose them to memory the next day. Nut over a
season, they pile up far higher than the dry stack of
records and numbers and honors. I he box score con
tains no column for "points created,' no tally for "in
spiration," no totals for "did-l-just-see-that?" mo
ments. Those are preserved only in the memories of
a season, a season in which Jamie Carey brought a
