# Carey's value not in numbers

They say thai numbers
don't lie. Jamie Carey's
numbers for last year are
starkly impressive: 1 1
points per game, a school-record
HI three-pointers, .478 three-point
percentage in conference plav.
The list of her honors is long
and equally as impressive: Pacific
Ten Conference Freshman of the

Year, Honorable Mention All-Pat -10, freshman All-
America honors from basketball publications lai
and wide.
Study Jamie Carey's freshman year at Stanford lor
even a few minutes and you can see almost every
thing. The numbers, the records, the honors; they
pile up like medals fora war veteran returning home
at last.
fiut sometimes the numbers lie.
Look at the numbers long enough and they can
convince you that Carey was <i basketball player with
an outstanding season; nothing more, nothing less. A
memorable year? Sure. A year for the history books?
Maybe. A year that ( hanged basketball? No.
What anyone who watched Care\ s first and final
Cardinal season will tell you, though, is that the num
bers conceal the truth; that Carey changed her

games, changed the season, ( hanged tlu 1 team and
changed Stanford basketball in ways that cannot be
quantified.
Carey's retirement to prevent further risk of seri
ous concussion ranks among the most biting losses in
Stanford sports in the last few decades, and the loss is
not one of numbers and records, although they will
be missed.
What will be missed more soreh are the smallest of
touches: a head-bobbing dribble up the floor, a sud
den explosive feint to the basket, a glance across the
floor to point guard Milena Mores, on recognition of
weakness in a defense, a stuttering drive to the basket
and laser pass out to a teammate, a stare and a low
ered head, arms outstretched, daring her opponent
to try the shot she was given.
Those that watch the games see these moments
and lose them to memory the next day. Nut over a
season, they pile up far higher than the dry stack of
records and numbers and honors. I he box score con
tains no column for "points created,' no tally for "in
spiration," no totals for "did-l-just-see-that?" mo
ments. Those are preserved only in the memories of
a season, a season in which Jamie Carey brought a


Jeff Cooper
new and brilliant spark to Stanford
basketball.
"(ireat players to me are players
that bring out the best in other
players," said Stanford head coach
I ara VanDerveer. "And 1 think
ihat |aniie does that."
I lie impression that one got
watching Carey pop onto the court
after a break was a sort of guerrilla
war general, as drawn by basket
ball fans at I )isnev.
She looked for holes, chal
lenged strengths and put herself
and the ball in the light place at the
right time.
Court vision, team knowledge,
sense of game flow: 1 hese are skills
that are difficult, maybe impossi
ble, to teach. Carey had 'em in
grade school. (> here, shoot then,
pass the ball there. Simpler than
the AB( s.
You couldn't help noticing it
from the stands. From the first
game on, fans saw talent, work

ethic and the constant tenacious
energy and responded.
Show their love? Please. Show
me a fan who saw Carey play last
year and didn't see something spe
cial and I'll show you someone
who spent the game in the bath
room. Everyone had a favorite
play or five to bring out after
games, on the way home. "Hey,
remember when . .Everyone
had liisown. You couldn't help but
remember.
Alter starting at off-guard last
season and occasionally splitting
point duties with Milena Flores,
this was to be the year when Carey
filled Flores's large shoes and
slipped into running the show.
I leek, she'd already been
named to the Preseason All-l'ac-10
team less than a week before her
announcement.
But someone, somewhere, de
cided this season wasn't meant to
be.
"In Jamie's situation, there's
no rehab," said VanDerveer.
"There's no 'a month, a year.' "
()ne too many hard elbows, one
too many bumps, one too many

limes struggling back up oil the
lloor. It happens. 1 hey'll si ill play
the game. Carey will be with the
team one way or another, back in
her warm-ups or game-day dress
clothes.
But it won't quite be the same at
Maples now, not lor a while. In
many ways, it'll always be different.
Cardinal basketball is left with
only a taste of potential: a shining
and cold gem of numbers and
records and honors, a historical
season for the almanac.
But sometimes numbers lie.
And what Jamie Carey did for
her teammates, her toadies and
her school shouldn't be remem
bered only by the numbers: It
should be remembered by the bits
and pieces, by the sudden glances
and slashing drives, by the exper
tise and vision she'll still bring to
the team from the sidelines.
They don't write statistics for
that sort of thing.

lloor. It happens. 1 hey'll si ill play
the game. Carey will be with the
team one way or another, back in
her warm-ups or game-day dress
clothes.
But it won't quite be the same at
Maples now, not lor a while. In
many ways, it'll always be different.
Cardinal basketball is left with
only a taste of potential: a shining
and cold gem of numbers and
records and honors, a historical
season for the almanac.
But sometimes numbers lie.
And what Jamie Carey did for
her teammates, her toadies and
her school shouldn't be remem
bered only by the numbers: It
should be remembered by the bits
and pieces, by the sudden glances
and slashing drives, by the exper
tise and vision she'll still bring to
the team from the sidelines.
They don't write statistics for
that sort of thing.
|ust this once, they should.

Jeff Coojwr, a senior, is privilege/I to
have watched C.arey's rookie year, and
wishes her and the team the best of luck.
