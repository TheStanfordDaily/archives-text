Ricklord.
"Students look beyond their

The trip to the Boone I (all

particularly memorable lor Kay.
"They had a small patch ol cot

plained that in slavery days there
was cotton as far as the eye could
see," kav said. "1 looked to the
1 iglit and there was a dense forest.
I o the leli there were some distant
lulls. And to get to the toad, ii was
about a one-mile drive.
"I looked around and realized
that if I had been a slave on this
plantation, esc ape — freedom —
would have seemed hopeless. But
somehow, despite these horrible
odds, ni\ ancestors exhibited the
com age and the will needed to es

never lelt more proud to be an
African-American."
Students use the knowledge
gained and the relationships built
on these the trips to complement
their academic experiences. Some
are even motivated to further re

While staving at the I niversilv

The learning expeditions
hope to teach students more than
they could have learned Irotn

Ricklord.
"Students look beyond their
limited experience they have with
Alric an culture [to gain] a broader
diversity of experience and histo

The trip to the Boone I (all
Plantation in South Carolina was
particularly memorable lor Kay.
"They had a small patch ol cot
ton growing on the land, but ex
plained that in slavery days there
was cotton as far as the eye could
see," kav said. "1 looked to the
1 iglit and there was a dense forest.
I o the leli there were some distant
lulls. And to get to the toad, ii was
about a one-mile drive.
"I looked around and realized
that if I had been a slave on this
plantation, esc ape — freedom —
would have seemed hopeless. But
somehow, despite these horrible
odds, ni\ ancestors exhibited the
com age and the will needed to es
cape, and.it that point I have
never lelt more proud to be an
African-American."
Students use the knowledge
gained and the relationships built
on these the trips to complement
their academic experiences. Some
are even motivated to further re
search similar subjec is.
"M\ nips to the South (Carolina
