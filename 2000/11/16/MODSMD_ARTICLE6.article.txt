I he I listory I )epartment held a teat h-in yes
tcrdav addressing the historical, political and
legal implications of the presidential election
controversv in Florida.
I listory Prof. |ack Rakove. Law Prof. Pamela
Karlan and Asst. Political Science Prof. Simon
|ac kinan spoke at the meeting.
Rakove, a spec ialist in early American histo
ry. said the Klectoral College "emerged by de
fault from the (Constitution.
According to Rakove, the Klec toral College
was "not the most attractive, but the least objec -
tionable" option for < boosing the president. Ac -
cording to the records of the Constitutional
Convention, it was assembled piece by piece
without any coherent logic to its structure.
"Most of the haulers thought the Electoral
( College was never going to work," lie- said.
I he Klectoral College was "difficult to con
ceptualize," he said, because no models of exec

utive power in a republic existed ;ti the lime. It
emerged as an alternative to popular election
and legislative election, because both of those
methods posed significant disadvantages.
Karlan, a voting rights and constitutional law
expert, addressed the legal implications of the
voter confusion. She pointed out that under the
country's system of federalism, local govern
ments control a national issue such as the presi
dential election.
She also discussed the problems with the bal
lots in Palm Beach County. Normally, she- said,
2,000 wrongly cast votes do not matter in an
election with (> million voters.
Many ballots have not vet been counted be
cause the stylus in the voting machine did not
punch all the way through the hole. As a result,
the counting machines did not record them,
Karlan said. A manual recount, in whic li work
ers "hold each ballot up to the light," can disc ern
these unpunched holes.
According to Karlan. a manual recount
would benefit the Democrats because the conn

ties that use these punch-card voting systems are
primarily I)cmocratic.
Karlan ( ailed a re-vote .111 unlikely possibility.
She said voters could not show "In a prepon
derance of the evidence" that they individually
had cast their ballots in error because they can
not track their ballots.
"Palm Beach Gounty voters would know
something the\ didn't know hist week," 111 tin
case of a revote, she said. "It's hard to put the
parties back in the position as if nothing had
gone wrong," as the courts would try to do.
Ja< ktnan, who studies electoral bias and the
role of statistics in elections, presented results
from a survey he had conducted after the elec
tion. The survey found that about hall the pop
ulation didn't know about or didn't understand
the Klecloral C College.
I lie survey illustrates the intensely partisan
nature of the election controversy, (ackman
said.
