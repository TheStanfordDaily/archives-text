1975
On Nov. 17, 1975, The Daily published
an article about troubles that come with
colder weather at Stanford.
"Meyer Undergraduate Library (UCiLY)
h.is 'definite heating problems,' iiu luding
extremes of hot and cold, according to Li
brarian Elizabeth Sal/ar.
"The heat on several occasions has
reached 80 degrees in many parts of the
building, and the Audio Library is often
warmer. 1 fowever, 'my greatest concert is in
the basement area' because of possible dam
age to microfilm storage, Sal/ar said.
"()n several occasions, library officials
have opened the fourth floor terrace doors
to cool down the building ....
" 'Meyer is built like a vault,' Heyeck
said, pointing to the lack ol opening win
dows in the building. The problem is 'how
we can make t lie facility more comfortable.'
UCiLY also lias noise problems which are
being studied, according to 1 feyeck."
Bottom line: UGLY? More like hot, stuffy and
noisy.
