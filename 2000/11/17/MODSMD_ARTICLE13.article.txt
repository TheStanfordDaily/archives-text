Four out of five men in Europe
share a common male ancestor who
lived as a primitive hunter some
40,000 years ago, researchers
say.
In a study Friday in the journal Sci
ence, researchers say that an analysis
of a pattern found in the Y chromo
some taken from 1,007 men from 25
places in Europe shows that about 80
percent of Europeans arose from the
Paleolithic people who first migrated
to Europe.
Peter A. Underbill, a senior re
searcher at the Stanford Genome
Technology Center in Palo Alto, Calif,
and co-author of the study, said the
research supports conclusions from
archaeological, linguistic and other
DNA evidence about the settlement of
Europe by ancient peoples.
" When we can get different lines of
evidence that tell the same stoiy, then
we feel we are telling the true history
of the species," said Underbill.
