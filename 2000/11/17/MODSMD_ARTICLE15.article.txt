HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — Ottering
"a new page in our relations with Viet
nam," President Clinton yesterday be
came the first U.S. president to visit
Hanoi, capital of the communist coun
try that America could not defeat 25
years ago.
Although the official welcoming cer
emony would not occur until this morn
ing, 200 to 300 Vietnamese gathered
outside his hotel downtown to get a
glimpse of Clinton. At the airport,
where security was tight, U.S. and Viet
namese flags, hanging side-by-side,
flapped in an autumn breeze.
About a do/en military officials lined
a red carpet to greet their guest.
Clinton was accompanied on his
three-day historic trip by scores of
American business executives eager to
open plants and sell goods to this coun
try of 78 million. 1 fe also was welcomed
by Vietnam's foreign minister Nguyen
l)v Nien and trade minister Vu Khoan.
Talk of trade would be mixed with
memories of the Vietnam War.
As a young man, ('.linton believed the
war was wrong and he demonstrated
against it, writing in 1960 that it was a
conflict he "opposed and despised." 112 le
avoided the draft, although he ulti
mately accepted it and drew a lottery
number that spared him induction.
The war itself ended with America's
withdrawal in 1973, followed two years
later by the collapse of the South Viet
namese government the United States
had sought to preserve.
While Vietnam's government wel
comes Clinton's visit and most ordinary
people express only good will toward
the United States, the people of this
soccer-mad country showed far more
interest in the Tiger Cup, a regional
tournament in which the national team
has been faring well. I lie country came
to a standstill while the games were on
television.
Enroute here, Clinton said the best
way to honor the Americans and Viet
namese who did, and died, "is to find a
way to build a better future and that's
what we're trying to do." I le said those
warriors, their weapons stilled by Com
munist victory in 1975, "believed on
both sides that what they were doing
was right."

('.linton is the third I .S. president to
visit Vietnam, and the first since the fall
of the South <md reunification under
Communist rule. Lyndon H.Johnson
went to Vietnam twice as president and
Richard M. Nixon once, in 1909.
Pete Peterson, the former pilot and
POW sent to Hanoi by Clinton as the
first postwar U.S. ambassador in 1997,
said no one there ever talked to him
about the president's anti-war past.
"It probably is well known, but it's
never been mentioned to me and I
doubt seriously if there will be any ref
erence to it at all during his visit —at
least, c ertainly, by the Vietnamese," Pe
terson said.
First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
arrived in I lanoi ahead of her husband,
flying in yesterday from Israel, where
she delivered a eulogy at the funeral of
Leah Rabin, widow of former Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.

Witli no official activities scheduled
for the day, Mrs. Clinton toured an art
gallery and went shopping on Hang Gai
street, finned fora string of shops offer
ing everything from souvenirs to liigli
(juality silk products. Today and tomor
row, she planned to meet with women's
groups in and around Hanoi.
Clinton spent yesterday in confer
ences with Pacific Rim leaders, who
closed out the annual Asia-Pacific Eco
nomic Cooperation forum by calling for
a new round of global trade talks. He
also held separate, private meetings
with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro
Mori and Chinese President Jiang
Zemin.
(ilinton and Jiang made progress to
ward curtailing Beijing's missile exports
and decided tentatively to resume sev
ered human rights talks, Stanley Roth,
assistant secretary of State for East Asian
and Pacific Affairs said.
