BANDAR SERI BECAWAN, Brunei (AP)
— President Clinton and Chinese President
|iang Zemin made progress yesterday toward
curtailing Beijing's missile exports and resum
ing t.ilks on human rights, State Department
official said.
Phe leaders met on the sidelines of the 21-
member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum, au annual summit of Pacific Rim coun
tries. It was the last scheduled international
gathering for Clinton, who leaves office Jan. 20.
Meeting with Jiang, Clinton raised long
standing U.S. concerns about China's missile
exports. "There was some progress made but
I'm not going to detail it." said Stanley Roth,
assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific Affairs. "We'll have more to say in the
days to come."
I te described the missile discussions as gen
eral in nature, noting that talks have been held
recently among experts from both countries.
China severed the dialogue on human
rights, as well as contacts between the C Chinese
and U.S. militaries and talks on security issues
and arms proliferation, following NATO's ac

cidental bombing of the Chinese Kmbassv in
Yugoslavia in 1999. Since then, China has re
sumed or agreed to resume all the exchanges
except human rights. The human rights dis
pute intensified last April when the United
States, at a U.N. commission in Ceneva,
sought to censure China for human rights
abuses.
('.linton told Jiang it would be helpful if the
dialogue could be resumed. "Interestingly,
President Jiang responded by saying he
agreed, that he thought dialogue would be a
useful way to go," Roth said.
Roth characterized it as "an agreement in
principle rather than a specific agreement that
the dialogue was going to be resumed .it a spe
cific date."
Roth said the bombing "did not come up in
any context."
Clinton <ind Jiang met for HO minutes and
agreed th.it relations between Washington
and Beijing were stronger now but that there
were problems that needed to be addressed,
Roth said. They covered oft-discussed topus
such as Taiwan, Tibet and religious freedoms.
