## SALAD DAYS Silencing the majority 
### 
The National Right to Lite Com
mittee lias been busy in the past
couple of clays. On Wednesday,
the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals in Atlanta agreed to hear their ar
guments as to why the recounts in Florida
should be stopped. Ihe committee ap
parently has strong objections to a manu
al recount, and are seeking to have the re
counts "aborted," if you will.
Why are conservative activists, along
with the Bush campaign, so eager to put
their faith in the voting machines, so
adamantly against

manual recounts? Be
cause they're afraid of
losing. I he Bush cam
paign, now receiving
help from the National
Right to Life (lommit
tee, is obstructing an
accurate recount in
Florida.
The current margin

of 300 votes in Florida is statistically in
significant. There was a swing of more
111.111 1,500 voles in Gore's favor in the first
recount. (llearly, 300 votes are well within
the margin of error for the voting ma
chines.
Also, consider that a manual recount in
Palm Beach County, involving a sample
of One percent of the county's precincts,
would yield 1900 votes for (Jore if extrap
olated county-wide. I hose are real votes,
cast In real Floridians, which the voting
mac hines missed.
()ne reaction to this: "Machines are al
ways more accurate than people. Let's go
with the machine count." But we know for
a fact that the- machines will not count
votes that are not completely punched
through. I he voting mac hines only count
votes that are squarely and cleanly
punched.
People who punched their ballot and
failed to punch it through completely clo
not deserve to be disenfranchised.
Obviously, only a very small minority
of ballots were clearly punched (to the
human eye) but not tallied by the voting
machines. But the vote in Florida is so
< lose ili.it this small minority of people ab
solutely need to have their votes counted
if the true winner of Florida is to be
known.
katherine Harris, a vocal Bush sup
porter during the campaign, is Florida's
secretary of state. The courts ruled that
the deadline she set for vote certification,
Tuesday at ."> p.m., would stand. She was
also instructed to be fair in judging the re
sults of recounts when the numbers did
come in.

She wasted no time in trying to block
the recount on Wednesday. 1 he Florida
Supreme Court denied her ret|ttest, but I
expect her to continue to be an obstacle to
an accurate vote count in Florida.
Both the Republicans and the
Democrats know th.n the first count was
woefully inaccurate and that an act urate
count could change the outcome of the
entire election.
That is precisely why the two parties
have acted so differently. I he Bush team
is trying to stop the recount, and the (lore
team is trying to keep it going.
Some people like to point out that the
Broward, Miami-Dade, Volusia and I'ahn
Beach counties are heavily Democratic.
That's absolutely true. 1 hat is win the
Core team is so very concerned that all of
the votes were counted correcth in those
places. But Warren Christopher. Core's
point man in Florida, has also stated that
he would not object i! the Republicans
sought recounts in other counties in the
interest of a more accurate overall vote
count.
If the Bush camp were interested in an
accurate count, Christopher's proposal is
exactly what they would do. But they
aren't doing it. I he\ re banking that the
rest of America is in such a hurry to inau
gurate someone, even it it is the wrong
guy, that it won't support the recount ef
forts.
An MSNBC 1 poll, ( otitlut ted I ucsda\.
indicates that most Americans want to
wait and get accurate results instead of
rushing to make mistakes. I his is heart
ening, as 1 have heard a l< >1 < >1 people w h< >
are saving, "Let's just it ovei with." or
running around like Chicken Little
lamenting, "What will happen to the pres
idency if we don't crown a \ it tor soon?"
Think of it this way: What would hap
pen if we crown a president too soon?
1 lie outcome in Florida will decide the
winner of this elet tion, that much is tairh
certain. If there isn't .i thorough and ac
curate count in Florida (and, for sure,
there isn't vet), then the presidents is
meaningless.
If the will of the American people, ex
pressed In their votes last I ucsdav, is not
carefully and accurately obtained, then
the president, be he Bush or Core, is ille
gitimate, an impostor, a fake.
By attempting to block the recounts,
Bush and his allies are preparing the
presidency for its future status. Inaccu
rate. Illegitimate. Impostor. Fake.
