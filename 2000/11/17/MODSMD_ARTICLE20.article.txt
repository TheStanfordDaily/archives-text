Abortion services need attention
I am writing in response to a letter writ
ten In Klissa Meites several (lavs ago, "Mis
information in pro-choice letter" (Now
I 1). I was disappointed to find her idea o!
setting the "record straight" to he .is misin
formed ;is she claimed the letter she was
criticizing to be.
lo iineqnivo* all\ state that "All clinics
. . . keep records, know what to do in case
ol complications and follow up with pa
tients where possible" is presumptuous
and idealistic.
As the son of a pli\sician who owns a clin
ic and who works with other independent
phvsicians, I know lor a fact that her state
ment is inact urate and false in manv cases,
iuc luding those of manv abortion clinics.
I Mi\sicians are as prone to mistakes and
oversights as are all other human beings,
and it is this fact that the "Demand more
from vour pro-choice candidates!" letter
attempted to make clear. Although statis
tics ma\ show abortion to be the "most
common surgical procedure for women,"
as Meites mentioned, it can — notice 1 did
not sav "will" — still be a verv traumatic ex
perience for manv women, especially
when 11 lev do not fully understand it.
1 his can only be more aggravated In a
pooi K run clinic and bv doctors who are
more concerned about turning profits
than educating and taring for their pa
tients. Not all phvsicians are as cold and
careless as this — I would never say such a
thing about mv lather! — but the truth re

mains that some are, and so women should
demand more of both their abortion
providers and their elected officials.
"IMo-choice," as I have been told, means
in favor of "choice," not necessarily abor
tion. I herefore. doctors and elected offi
cials both should work together to provide
not only the sen ice it self but also education
and facts, details of the procedure and,
most important of all, realistic alternatives.
Also, I would like to present a little food
for thought: One common argument in
favor of the right to abortion is that abor
tion has to do with a woman's body and
that no one has the right to tell bet what to
do with her both. However, in this mod
ern age in which battles are already raging
over lights to tissue samples and genetic
material, can we really consider a fetus,
which inherited half of its 46 chromosomes
from its lather, part of a woman's body?

Palm Beach needs a revote
I am a Democrat who agrees that the
hand recounting is unfair if it is clone in
only the largely Democratic counties.
However, 1 think the whole hand-re
counting debate has diverted attention
from what is really the most important out
standing issue: the ballot in Palm Beach.
Any objective statistical analysis shows
beyond any reasonable doubt that
Buchanan received about 2,000 votes

more, or three times more, than he should
have, given the number of registered Re
form Party members in Palm Beach. It is
equally clear that the only explanation is
that these were votes intended lor (iore, as
many Palm Beach voters have testified.
These 2,000 votes are more than
enough to turn the election to (iore. Plus
there are the 19,000-some votes in Palm
Beach which were disqualified because two
candidates were selected — several thou
sand more than were disqualified for the
same reason in 1996.
Yet people quickly dismiss the idea of a
revote in Palm Beach because it is un
precedented.
Well, this situation is unprecedented, as
I'm sure we can all agree.
The situation in Palm Beach indicates
that it we had observed perfectly the in
tended choices of everyone in Florida, the
candidate who lost in the first count — (iore
— would had very likelv been the winner by
a couple thousand votes or more.
Can the same be said regarding any
other county in Florida or any other state
in the U.S.?
Do we want to say "tough luck" to those
Palm Beach voters and elect a president
who almost certainly would not have won
Florida if everyone's true preference had
been recorded? Or do we want to go to
extra lengths to assure that the people's
true preference is heard?
