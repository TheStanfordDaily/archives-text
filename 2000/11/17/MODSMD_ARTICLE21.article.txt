# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Friendly competition: Stanford-Berkeley gets out of hand 
### DAVID ARULANANTHAM GUEST COLUMNIST 
Ed Ho) \ Mote: I his piece appeared as a let
ter in the Daily CaliJ'ornian, U('.-Berkeley's
student newspaper, on Tuesday, Nov. 23,
1999.
Some things never change.
As a Stanford student, I want to
distance myself from the small
but vocal minority on this cam
pus who are too caught up in
i hi- petty details of the UCi-Berkeley-
Stanibrd rivalry to look at the larger pic -
ture in the whole issue: Together the two
s< hools constitute one of the premier cen
ters of academic learning in the United
States, have main close contacts, share a

common past and ate arguablv the best
public and private institution pair in the
country.
I would like nothing more than some
friendly competition between Berkele\
and Stanford. 1 here's no harm in some
good-natured humor at the expense ol
another institution that is a sister s< liool.
My older brother having attended
Berkeley, I developed a c ertain loudness
for the University and the city during
family trips. I still have that interest in the
c ity and respect for the University. Fur
thermore, with .ill my close friends from
high school now at Berkeley, if anvthing
the connection has been strengthened.
However, 1 really can't stand all the
gratuitous Stanford-bashing from the
other side of the Bay. For some reason,

when Berkeley students criticize Stan
ford, it takes a mean, vitriolic and some
what violent angle. I know a number of
people who wouldn't feel safe or com
fortable walking around Berkeley wear
ing a Stanford I-shirt. 1 he reverse is def
initely not true for ibis campus.
Also, witness the Daily Cal columnist
who made a tasteless and degrading ref
erence to our school's most famous stu
dent in a pre-Big (lame column three
years ago.
Lastly, who can forget the infamous
and very classy "Fuck Stanfurd" I -shirts
worn by so many students at Big (lame?
What a display of creativity.
Whenever I meet someone from U( -
Berkeley, the conversation seems to turn
to Stanford's academic's and supposedly

how "lenient'' the grading policies are.
Other times, I've heard Stanford de
scribed .is an expensive and elitist coun
try club that tries to model itself on the
schools of the Ivy League. Stanford stu
dents are all greedy and money-hungry,
while Berkeley students are supposedly
vet v socially conscious and anti-elitist.
()n more than one occasion, I ve found
myself defending mv dec ision to come to
Stanford and sensing strong envy and re
sentment from the other party.
Let's face facts. As students at two of
the most academic ally elite universities in
the world, everyone is part of "the sys
tem." No matter how much they vilify us
for the institution we belong to, remem
ber that Berkeley students too, have ac
cepted and are part of the social and eco

nomic elite.
Kveryone in our posit ions luis adhered
to the rules of the game, no matter how
much we may like to entertain fantasies ol
being "revolutionaries." If we hadn't, we
wouldn't be here.
Furthermore, let's not allow this rival
ry toget out of hand. People on both sides
of the Bay need to grow up and realize
that this is just a competition between two
universities, not a war. What does it mat
ter it you lose a damn football game?
Hell, Berkeley has been doing it for six
straight years. Or, for whatever reason,
does it mean more than that to some?
