Big Game season is upon us.
You only have to take a casual stroll
through White I'la/a to see some of
the antics firsthand.
l.ook to your left and you'll see a
group of Axe (lommittee members
keeping a devoted vigil with an
hourly countdown to Big (lame.
Look to your right and you'll see the
cuddly Gal mascot impaled atop the
('.law, remnants of 'I'lie Stanford
Hand's Bcarial ceremony. Walk to
ward the Quad and see projections
on Hoover Lower of'past Big Game
plays.
For the past several days, the
Stanford campus has been inundat
ed with bizarre rituals in commem
oration of the event that has be
come svnonvinous with the intense
rivalry against I ('.-Berkeley: Big
Game. But what's all the hype real
l\ about? Is the excitement fell by
all?
(Certainly many students are an
ticipating the big da)'. Freshman
Alex Robbins cannot wait for the
game.
"It's our single best chance to
show our aggression toward Berke
ley," Robbins said.
Another freshman, Wael Sal
loum, looks forward to I lie game be
cause of the crazy antics he has
heard about.

"There are some rumors about
the Band stripping last year," Sal
loum said. "I can't wait to see what
they're going to do this year."
Not .ill students are that en
thused, however. Junior Nathan
1 )oty, a resident assistant in Paloma,
saicl that only half of the residents in
his all-freshman dorm are planning
to attend.
"Despite the festive atmosphere,
I'm going to watch it on TV this
year," said senior Rachel Widens.
"I'm not <i huge football fan."
However, Axe Gomm's dedica
tion to rallying enthusiasm and pro
moting Big Game rivalry has had
positive effects in the past several
years, junior James Gook, an Axe
Gomm member, said that he sees
more freshmen coming to Big
Game each year. Ghairman Kris
Andeen, a senior, takes pride in the
group's antics.
"Someone has to keep the tradi
tions alive, and we have a great tijne
doing it," Andeen saicl. "It let's us be
obnoxious and crazy to rally stu
dent support."
In honor of Saturday's 103 rd
Big Game, Axe Gomm members
are sleeping out in White Plaza for
103 hours before the first kickoff.
Kvery hour they blow ;t nitrogen
train whistle to signal the narrow
ing window of time before Big
Game. Walk past their camp site,

and you just might find them en
gaged in a lively conversation dis
cussing past Big Game football
plays. After listing the most excit
ing plays of the last couple years,
sophomore Alex Greninger
shared his own take on the rivalry
between the two teams.
"We're underac hievers. They're
underac hievers. Therefore, the
game's pretty good," Greninger
saicl.
The Band does its part, as well,
to increase fervor and excitement
before Big (iame. According to alto
player Brandis Belt, a freshman,
every section has a special project
and costume just for Big (iame.
However, specifics are still under
wraps.
"The craziest thing ever is hap
pening this year," said senior niel
lophone player Joey Pritikin. "It'll
go down in the annals."
He refused to comment further.
The intense rivalry between
Stanford and Gal has been known
to lead some die-hard fans to com
mit crazy pranks. Last year, the
crew team ruined Gal's fountain
with red dye and foam. Before that,
a group of LIG-Berkeley students
released mice, dved blue and gold,
in one of the Stanford libraries. An
other group of Gal students initiat
ed a failed attempt to paint Hoover
lower. This never-ending series of

pranks, however, does have its
roots in historv.
It all started when John Whitte
niore, ;i transfer student in 1891,
organized a triendlv football game
between some Stanford students
and those gnvs from across the Bay.
()n March 19, they met in a sandlot

near San Francisco's Haight and
Sfanyan streets. After an initial
delay because both teams had for
gotten to bring a football, the game
began. Stanford won 14-10.
Over the years, I his rivalry lias
cemented itself into the fabric of
Stanford's athletic history. Stanford

cm rently holds the longest winning
streak in the series, winning six con
secutive times between 1961 and
1 ( .)(»(». A triumph this year would tie
the record b\ establishing another
six vears of unbreakable victory.
Students ;tre optimistic that Stan
lord will emerge victorious again.
