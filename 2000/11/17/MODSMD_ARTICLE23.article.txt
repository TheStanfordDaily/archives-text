Using electric circuits and a Van de (iraaff
generator that shoots sparks when touched,
Stanford students creatively demonstrate the
power of'electricity to East Palo Alto kids in one
of their weekly visits to the (lost.mo Elemental \
School.
In the past, Stanford students have taken the
children on a tree tour of their eletnentarv
school, teaching them about the different
species.
These fun and educational activities are di
rected by SEEd, Science and Environmental
Education, a campus group that teaches local
children about science in the world around
them.
"For me, personally, it is one of the high
lights of my week," said senior Dhakshin Ra
manathan, one of the four coordinators of
SEEd. "You see the kids enjoying it. After a
while, instead of you telling them what photo
synthesis is, they're telling you."
According to Kamanathan, the program
originally grew out of Students tbi Environ
mental Action at Stanford eight years ago and
was chartered in 1993.
SEEd's purpose is to educate elementary
school children about science and the environ
ment while forming bonds between the two age

groups, according to its members. In all, about
25 Stanford students and well over 100 stu
dents in seven classrooms at Costano in East
I'alo Alto are involved in SEEd.
Stanford students prepare and teach one
bom lessons to third-, fourth- and fifth-grade
classes* Kamanathan said that the college stu
dents have the freedom to tailor the lessons to
their own interests and teaching si\ les but that
there is a general curriculum that the Costano
students follow. I bird-grade lessons are fo
cused on ecology and ccos\ stems, fourth-grade
lessons on plants and agriculture and fifth
grade lessons on en\ ironmental issues.
hi past years, students have taken field trips
to the Nan Francisco Bay and the Stanford
Conununitv Farm, among other places. Ibis
sear, senior Man Swain said she hopes to take
the kids to some even more exotic locations.
She is interested in getting the kids out to see
different ecosvstems, such as wetlands, forests
and aquatic environments.
Swain, who has worked for national parks,
said she believes it is important to show students
the daih effects of environmental issues like
pollution, use of natural resources and the
water cycle.
"[SEEd] gets kicls excited about the environ
ment,' Swain said. "| li | sparks an interest in na
ture."
Funds from the ASM are usuallv sufficient
for most field trips SEEd coordinates. Howev
er. this vear the program hopes to take the chil
dren to locations siu li as Monterev Bav Aquar
ium, which will require extra money. Ra

manathan hopes to acquire these funds
through a grant from the Sierra (Hub.
Swain pointed out that Stanford students
are more than just teachers to these children.
"[We] are there as role models too," Swain
said. According to Swain, the elementary school
kids look, up to Stanford students. "[SEEd is a
program that] does more than just teach knowl
edge." she added.
Senior Laura Brown, who has participated
in SEEd in previous years, said she thinks the
teaching experience in front of a full classroom
is valuable for Stanford students as well.
"SEEd members learn to break down and
give information to children," Brown said. She
said she also thinks it helps Stanford students
rediscover the big picture of science and what
originally excited them about the subject before
they began to specialize in their respective
fields.
Students have various reasons lor joining
SE Ed.
Misra original!) joined the program because
his friends pressured him to do so, but now lie
is extremely glad that they did.
"[Being in SEEd] keeps me from getting
stuck in a rut at Stanford," he said. "1 enjoy get
ting out .uul meeting people from different age
groups and backgrounds."
Others simply enjoy teaching and interact
ing with young people.
"1 love working with children," senior Robin
I'clc said. "I think it is really important to instill
an appreciation for the environment at a young
age."
