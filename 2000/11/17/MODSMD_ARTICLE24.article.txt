Hut the ('.ardinal is putting that
di//\ ing string of numbers aside to
locus on one number — live, as iu
live games to a championship.
After finishing the regular sea
son with .1 strong I(">-2-1 record,
the Stanford men's soccer team
learned Monday that it would
make its fourth straight appear
ance in the tournament. As a re
sult, the (Cardinal will have the lux
ury ol plaving all ol its games until
the Final Four in the comforts of
New Malonev Field.
Stanford gets the first round ol
action under way tomorrow as it
looks to t.ike clown the I itans ol
('.al-State Fullerton.
Currently ranked No. IS In
Soccer America, the I itans fin
ished up their season in impressive
fashion, ending with a record ol
1.1 .ind finishing second in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion behind the nation's only un
defeated team, No. 8-seeded San

Jose State.
The match against Fullerton
will be a difficult start to .1 tough
tournament tor the ('.ardinal.
In the past, these two teams
haveonh met a total of eight times.
In 1998, the most recent meeting
between the two, the teams played
to a I-1 tie.
"Fullerton is going to be .1 real
battle," said senior forward Luke
Rust. " I'hev're going to be last and
physical and we need to make sure
that we're ready to fight. We've re
ally been trying to take care of all
the little things in preparation for
the tournament, talking as a team
about what we can do better on the
game field. But, I think we're
ready for the best competition this
tournament has to offer.
Stanford better be ready. This
season the l itans have certainlv
shown that thev can pla\ with the
best. Not only have the\ beaten a
handful of good opponents, in
cluding sixth-seeded Southern
Methodist and I (11..\, but lour out
of their live losses have been
against other tournament teams,
three of which were in overtime.
"We know the\ have a good
team and they have clone well
against top-ranked teams, so this
is not going to be an easy game,
said senior midfielder Sean N\ Ivis.

this could very well be the tough

est of the first three rounds, but
regardless the team has no illu
sions of walking through the tour
nament easily."
Nevertheless, Stanford has a
near-perfect record fora reason.
All season long the Cardinal has
shown time and again that it can
take on any opponent. In the
team's 19 games this season, Stan
ford has knocked off two previ
ously No. 1-ranked teams, UCLA
and Indiana, tied San Jose State,
and beaten a number of other
high-quality opponents. The Car
dinal's two losses came off set plays
in overtime.
But those losses are in the
rearview mirror right now. Just
this week, senior midfielder
Ryan Nelson was named this sea
son's Conference Player of the
Year and Stanford head coach
Bobby Clark was given Pac-10
Coach of the Year honors. But it
doesn't stop there—l 2 different

players were placed on All-Con
ference teams, including a
league-high five on the First
Team.
Sophomore defender I odd
Dunivant, senior midfielder Scott
Leber, junior defender Lee Mor
rison and senior goalkeeper
Adam Zapala joined Nelsen on the
First Team. Junior defender
Aaron Biddle and senior forward
Corey Woolfolk were named to
the Second Team, while sopho
more forward Roger Levesque,
sophomore forward Johanes Mal
i/a, junior midfielder Derek
Shanahan, Rust and Sylvis each
earned Honorable Mention dis
tinctions.
Regardless of what has hap
pened this season, it all comes
down to tomorrow night under
the- lights of New Maloney field at
7:30 p.m.
"Its do or die and neither team
will be holding anything back,
making fora very physical and in
tense game," Leber said. "Playing
at home with the students there
cheering us on will make the
game even better."
