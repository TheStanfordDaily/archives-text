After the Stanford men's basketball

screeching halt at the bands ol

said. Not enough athleticism,
the\ said.
Hut the intense si i utim is
just part of the new woi Id ordei
for Stanford hoops, which has
seen itself transfbi med Ik »ni .1
s< 1 app\ Pat ilit 1 0 (mfereiu e

underdog 10 .111 elite program
competing vear-in and vear-om
with the nation's best.

Ihe 2000-2001 version of coach
Mike Montgomery's s(|tiad is as loaded
as it ever has been. I lie team lost only two

starters from last veai s Par-1 0 co-champions,
but a big two startc*i s the\ wei e.
111 addition to being two of the most talent
ed plavers 011 the team, Mark Madsen and
David Moselcv were piobabh not the most t.il
ented plavers on last year's squad. but the
calming present e and leatlei ship the\ piovid
etl to a team laden with freshmen proved in-

TU
valuable at times, fhecjiiestion now is whoout
o! this year's group of seniors, not the most
liei \ bunch, will step up 011 that end.
"Madsen was so unique, you're not going

to replace that kind ola person almost re
gardless ol what von do," Montgomery said.
"We've alwavs had someboch sav when kids
graduate, 'When that gu\ leaves, bow are
von going to replace him?' and some-

body's always stepped up. I think, this
year will be no exception."
Of course, il leadership is
the main question mark heading
& into the start of the reuular season,

things arc going well, especially as
Stanford preps for the beginning of
a tough 1 'at -10 schedule in January.
"100 percent healthy, I like
our basketball team. Montgomery
said. "1 like the depth, I think our
big kids we have some si/e, some
strength. We have a lot of young
gu\sat our win<> spots, but I think we

can be pretty good.
)list as last vear. the strength of the

Cardinal lies in the middle, where as
many as three players standing taller than

(i-foot-10 will roam the post .it am given
time. I he most dominant plavei should be se
nior power forward |arron (.ollins, fresh of a
summer session at fete Newcll's Big Man
(lamp and reads to prove he belongs in the
NBA loitera next June.
Collins will be joined b\ his twin brother

|ason, a redshiri si>phoniore with a
better inside game and a slighth
bigger bod\. .ill the better for bai
lling under the boards. Rounding
out the trio is sophomore (Curtis
Bernhardt, who da//led observers
with Ins wingspan and shooting
range during t lie first half Of lasi
season before going down with a
stress fracture in his right foot.
I hough questions remain
about his durability, Borchardt's
exhibition performances — CM
points and 19 rebounds (oinbined
in two games — hint that he could
be close to full recovery.
Redshiri freshman j list in Davis,
who lias missed several practices
this year due to iii|iir\. will take
over Madsen's role as a bruiser
iui(lei the boards. He will gel help
there from true freshman (and
third-string Stanford quarterback)
levo Johnson. Johnson s athleti
(ism, not to mention his hustle and
intensity, is already draw ing raves
112 rom observers.
I lie backcourt will change little
from last ve.n. save for sophomore
(Case\ Jacobsen stepping into
Moselev's starting role at shooting
guard. Stead\ senior Mike Mc-
Donald will man the point once
again, where he is adept at run
ning Montgomery's ollense but
not .is proficient at scoring. I hat
max change this vear. as Mt Don
ald lias shown in exhibit ions aw ill
ingness to shoot the 3-pointer
more often.
Junior Tony (liovacchini and
sophomore 11 iliiis Barnes will spell
McDonald at the* point, bui who
will be first off the bench is still up
in the air. (iiovacc liini has a better

grasp of the offense; Barnes is
cjiiii kcr and more athletic but
tends to be undisciplined at times.
"[Barnes is| much improved
from where he was last year, and
lie's more mature," Montgomery
said, "lie's definitely trying to
show some leadership, and lie's
telling players where to go and
what to do. I would suspect he
would get more [playing time than
last year]."
Jacobsen will likely be the
team's offensive centerpiece, with
his NBA 3-point range and slash
ing ability stretching opponents'
defenses to keep pressure off the
post players inside. Backing him
up will be freshman Matt l.ottuh
who is tut from the same cloth as
Jacobsen, outside shooting touch
and all.
Meanwhile, starting small for
ward senior Rvan Mcnclcz should
contribute excellent rebounding
ability along with his outside shoot
ing, giving the (Cardinal a large ar
senal of accurate gunners from be
hind the arc.
I he main weakness on the
team, besides the leadership ques
tion, is its nagging lac k of quick
ness compared to other teams like
Arizona. I he Wildcats twice ex
posed the- (Cardinal's holes in cru
cial I'ac-10 games last vear. Don't
look for any major < lianges in of
fensive philosophy to compensate,
though.
"Yoii like to do some things bel
ter, but it's hard to be critical of the
fact thai we were No. 1, we won the
conference championship, etc.,"
said Montgomery. "Obviously
what we're doing with this group
of kids works. There will be some
subtle c hanges, but nothing most
people w ill notice."
1 he first team tocxpei ience the
"subtle (lianges" this season w ill be

San Krancisco Slate, a Division II
team heading into Maples Pavilion
Sunda\ night to lip oil Stanford's
regular season. I he Gators are
coining off a 4-23 season in the
(.alifoi nia (lollegiate Athletic Asso

ciation, finishing last in the 12-
tcam conference.
Needless i<> sav, it shouldn't be
much of a lest for the (Cardinal
Sunda\ night, but the road to (lie
Final Four has to start somewhere.
