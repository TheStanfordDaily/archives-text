Hut the intense si i utim is
just part of the new woi Id ordei

underdog 10 .111 elite program
competing vear-in and vear-om
with the nation's best.

Ihe 2000-2001 version of coach
Mike Montgomery's s(|tiad is as loaded
as it ever has been. I lie team lost only two

starters from last veai s Par-1 0 co-champions,
but a big two startc*i s the\ wei e.
111 addition to being two of the most talent
ed plavers 011 the team, Mark Madsen and
David Moselcv were piobabh not the most t.il
ented plavers on last year's squad. but the
calming present e and leatlei ship the\ piovid

valuable at times, fhecjiiestion now is whoout
o! this year's group of seniors, not the most
liei \ bunch, will step up 011 that end.
"Madsen was so unique, you're not going

to replace that kind ola person almost re
gardless ol what von do," Montgomery said.
"We've alwavs had someboch sav when kids
graduate, 'When that gu\ leaves, bow are
von going to replace him?' and some-

body's always stepped up. I think, this
year will be no exception."
Of course, il leadership is
the main question mark heading
& into the start of the reuular season,

things arc going well, especially as
Stanford preps for the beginning of
a tough 1 'at -10 schedule in January.
"100 percent healthy, I like
our basketball team. Montgomery
said. "1 like the depth, I think our
big kids we have some si/e, some
strength. We have a lot of young
gu\sat our win<> spots, but I think we

can be pretty good.
)list as last vear. the strength of the

Cardinal lies in the middle, where as
many as three players standing taller than
