Before turning over Stanford men's bas

roach loin Davis saitl in April 1980, "[Stan

I here are 4,000 4.0 students competing for
those 1,500 spots...l think it's terrific what the
school accomplishes, but it does make it tlifli

cull lot basketball and football coaches."
Montgomcn has proven
Davis wrong.
With I odd Lichti, Stanford s all-time lead
ing 1 sCoYer; Trtrrtßtv enr hfcr I'x )-87 team,
Montgomen began constructing the future
of Stanford basketball. Lichti led to Adam
keefe. then Brcvin Knight, Art Lee and Mark
Madsen. Montgomen demonstrated how far
he had taken Cardinal basketball four vears
ago when highlv-touted twins Jarron and
Jason ('.ollins c hose Stanford over hometown
powerhouse I (A.\.
Stanford's recruitment of top-notch play
ers didn't stop there. Sophomore Justin
Davis, a lierkclc\ native, ( hose Stanford ovei
(Cal. Sophomore Julius Barnes
gave up Arizona to come to Stan
ford. And of course there's sopho
more (Casev Jacobsen, the second
highest scorer in (California high
school basketball history.
"I think we've had a consisten
cy of philosophy," Montgomery
said. "The best student-athletes in
the country have started looking
at Stanford .is a place they could
go. When you combine the high
est level of basketball with the
value of the Stanford education, 1
think that's really starting to pay
dividends."
And unlike other coaches,
Montgomery has clone an un
precedented job of keeping them
all four years. Not a single men's
basketball player at Stanford has
left early.
Fake (Cal for example. (Cal's po
tential 1995-1996 basketball team
could have included Jason Kidd,
Sharif Abdur-Rahim, Tony (ion
zalez, Jerod Haaseand FcKirav, if
( Cal had kept all its players. That

team could have easily contended
fora national c hampionship, and
C.al could currently be in Stan
lord's shoes, a nightmare for any
member of the 6th Man ( Hub.
But as Stanford continues to
bring in the top players in the na
tion, the- likelihood that someone
will leave early becomes higher,
practically inevitable.
"Kids that can get into the
[NBA draft] lottery and go to the
pros, will go, whether it's here or
wherever it is," he said.
Montgomery also doesn't be
lieve that college basketball players
should be forced to stav in school.
"It doesn't make any sense. If a
kid has a c hance to financially so
lidify his future, they're going to
go, and there's no argument that
would really hold water that says
that's wrong."
However, like the Dukes and
North (larolinas, Stanford basket
ball lias reached a level where it
might not even matter if a couple
players leave early in the next few
years. Last Friday's signings of
Childress, Chris Hernandez and
Robert I it lie proved that the Stan
ford men's basketball powerhouse
is here to stay.
