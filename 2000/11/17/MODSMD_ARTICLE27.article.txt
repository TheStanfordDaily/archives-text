# Card heading to Cal for Big Splash match
## 
### ELIZABETH MIIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With Big Game coming upon Saturday, other,
less-known rivalries might be overshadowed bv
the Stanlbrd-CCalifornia football match. I lowever,
the water polo matchup, "Big Splash," holds a ri
valry comparable to ili.it of the Big (ianie.
Since 1969, (lal and Stanford have played each
oilier forthe N( IAA title six limes, splittingthe \ic -
lories three each. Cal won the last NCAA title
match versus Stanford in 1992, a 12-11 sudden
death overtime victory.
I his weekend will mark the fourth time
that the teams have played each other this
season. ()n Sept. 17, Oil lost 7-5 at home, but
beat the Oirdinal a week later .it Stanford, 7-
I. In the most recent matchup, Stanford bare
ly came up with a victory in the Nor Oil tour
nament, edging the Bears 8-7 to t.ike third
place overall in the tournament.
With both teams heading off to the omi
nous Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(Conference Championships after this week
end's battle, it is no wonder that both Stan
ford and Cal would like to tally .i win before
heading off into the most challenging water
polo tournament in the nation.
Stanford is currently ranked fifth national-
lv, holding an 11-11 overall
retold and .1 'J-(» record in the
Ml'SI While Clal's record of l'i-H
overall and.">-3 in the conference

might be more impressive, the
teams are evenly matched.
I hough the big Splash, held at
the Spieker Aquatics Complex at
Berkley this year, should exhibit
some ama/ing competition and ri
valry, the Cardinal has much to
work on before Saturday.
Shooting has been a hurdle

for Stanford since I lit' start of the
season. After suffering losses to
Cal, USC and UC-Irvine with a
combined total of nine goals in
three games, Stanford shot up a
storm, battling UCLA to an 8-7
double overtime loss.
Heading into the NorCal
tournament Od. 21 and 22,

Stanford looked to be in top
shape with a dominating de
fense and a rejuvenated offense.
Hut in the few weeks th.it fol
lowed, the Cardinal seemingly
lost its momentum. After losing
three out of the past four games,
Stanford seemed not only to
have lost its shooting touch but
also the defensive fire that kept
it alive early in the season.
"Our team doesn't communi
cate well — we just don't talk to
each other on offense or defense,"
Dettamanti s.iid after the Cardi
nal's I I-K loss to Long Beach
State last weekend. "We used to
be able to rely on the goalie but we
can't always play like [redshirt
sophomore Nick Kllis] will back us
up in the goal. I don't know. I
wish 1 had an answer, but I just
don't know."
Stanford will look to restore its
confidence as it goes into the
MI'SF Conference Tournament,
battling Cal at 10 a.m.
"I wish I knew what the solu
tion was," Dettamanti said. "We
still have a chance at the MPSF
tournament, but right now we're
just going to keep plugging
away, keep trying and keep
fighting."
