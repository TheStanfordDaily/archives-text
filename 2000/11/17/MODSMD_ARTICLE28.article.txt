After endless hours of practice, plav
making and teambuilding, ii is finally time
for the Stanford women to get down to busi
ness .md do what they do best — play ball.
Ihe Cardinal opens the season this
evening at nearby St. Mary's (.ollege, where
the\ will gel the opportunity to test their
carefully cultivated preparation against .1
competitive Bay Area rival.
Stanford looked great in its only pre-ex
liibition game against RTU ( londica of
Latvia, but the Latvian team played much
differently fiom traditional U.S. college
team basketball. The Latvians didn't have a
plaver that could challenge the ('.ardinal in
side. giving Stanford «i clear advantage ,11
the offensive and defensive cud of the court.
"We've got a lot a lot of versatilitv this
vear," s.iid junior Lauren St. ( lair. "We've
got people who can rebound, who can post
up «md who can drive."
Tonight's game is also St. Mary's first
contest of the season. In the p.ist two vcars
the team h;is come into its own as a Bav Area
threat, notching its first-ever \('AA tourna
ment appearance in IW9, and netting .1 20-

season play.

I his evening offers the ( .ardinal the first
opportunitx to plav against some quic k-st\ le
guards, the kind the team will likeh lace .ill
season.
In the offseason, St. Marys aajuired
three point guards in (".oriel Davis. (ourt
ne\ Ferguson and Conic Mi/usawa. In ad
dition. senior guard I lilarv Parker, was the
West (.oast Conference Defender of the
Yeat last \ e.u. and grabbed five steals in St.
Man s exhibition game against the ('.hinese
National Team.
After the loss of Milena Mot es to gradua
tion and Jamie (iai c\ to in jut v. Stanford will
likely have either freshmen Susan King or
Nicole Powell at the helm. Powell posted a
triple-double in bet first stint at point guard
in the exhibition game, but the newcomer is
possibh even more valuable in the forward
position. King, who sat out due to illness
against Is I I (.londica. will get bet first op
portunity to expei iem c the college game.
Freshman forward ( belsea I totter, also
making her college debut, could add a pow
erful offensive presence for the ( ardinal.
In addition to quality guards, the Gaels
also have some talent in the post positions.
|ertnisha and |erkisha Dorstv are strong of
fensive plavers that both received confer
