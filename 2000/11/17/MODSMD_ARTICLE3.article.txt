# Court rules to continue recounts

### 
TAFLU 1 ASS EE, Fla. (AP) — Florida's high
court gave the go-ahead yesterday to ballot re
counts in the state's chaotic presidential elec
tion but left unanswered the question of
whether the results will matter.
"There is no legal impediment to the re
counts continuing," the court said in a case
brought by Palm Beach County. Within min
utes, county officials announced they would
join adjacent Broward County in reviewing
hundreds of thousands of ballots In hand.
The Palm Beach count began yesterday
evening. A state judge was to dec ide as early as
today whether to overturn the Republican sec
retary of state's decision to reject any further re
count totals from Democratic controlled coun
t ies.
In the overtime campaign between lex.is
Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al
(lore, the ruling was a victory for the vi< e pres
ident, who had pressed for manual recounts in
four counties in hopes ofoverturning the I'exas
governor's .SOO-vote lead. About 'J.(>()() o\ei seas
absentee ballots remain to be counted, but so
far there is no dispute about them.
"The Supreme ('.ourt's clear and unambigu
ous ruling that the counties are authorized to
proceed with a manual recount is a \ic torv for
everyone who wants to see the votes counted
c learly and fairly here in Florida,'' Gore cam
paign chairman William Dale) said.
Republicans called the decision minor.
"The one-paragraph, interim order of the
Florida Supreme Court lias just been present
ed to you as the best thing since night baseball,"
said Bush's recount manager, former Secretary
of StateJames A. Baker 111. He said, in fact, the
order "does nothing more than preserve the

status quo."
Bush running mate* Dick Cheney said the
state's official count and recount showed Bush
was the winner — with the overseas absentees
still to come — and l>.u ring am change he ex
pee ted Secretary of State Katlierine Harris to
dec lare Bush the winner tomorrow.
Cheney said in an interview with Fox News
Channel that recounts In hand do not give a
more accurate result, "li is no longer really
c ounting, it is manipulation."' he said.
I he seven-member Floi ida court, all chosen
by Democratic governors, issued its unani
mous, one-paragraph order as Bush lawyers
looked to a federal appeals court in Atlanta to
stop the recounts altogether.

()ne of the four counties, Volusia, complet
ed its new tally in time to meet a 5 p.m. Tuesday
deadline established by 1 lan is. She has said the
state will not include any of the post-Tuesday
recount figures in its official tabulation, which
she intends to annouru e tomorrow.
In another county, Miami-Dade, officials
said thev would meet today to decide whether
to proceed.
Republicans, meanwhile, released federal
court affidavits from at least five witnesses who
contend they watched earlier hand recounts in
l'alm Beach County this week and observed ir
regularities and possible ballot tampering.
