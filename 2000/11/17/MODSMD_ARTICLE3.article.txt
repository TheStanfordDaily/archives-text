# Court rules to continue recounts
## 
### 
TAFLU 1 ASS EE, Fla. (AP) — Florida's high
court gave the go-ahead yesterday to ballot re
counts in the state's chaotic presidential elec
tion but left unanswered the question of
whether the results will matter.
"There is no legal impediment to the re
counts continuing," the court said in a case
brought by Palm Beach County. Within min
utes, county officials announced they would
join adjacent Broward County in reviewing
hundreds of thousands of ballots In hand.
The Palm Beach count began yesterday
evening. A state judge was to dec ide as early as
today whether to overturn the Republican sec
retary of state's decision to reject any further re
count totals from Democratic controlled coun
t ies.
In the overtime campaign between lex.is
Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al
(lore, the ruling was a victory for the vi< e pres
ident, who had pressed for manual recounts in
four counties in hopes ofoverturning the I'exas
governor's .SOO-vote lead. About 'J.(>()() o\ei seas
absentee ballots remain to be counted, but so
far there is no dispute about them.
"The Supreme ('.ourt's clear and unambigu
ous ruling that the counties are authorized to
proceed with a manual recount is a \ic torv for
everyone who wants to see the votes counted
c learly and fairly here in Florida,'' Gore cam
paign chairman William Dale) said.
Republicans called the decision minor.
"The one-paragraph, interim order of the
Florida Supreme Court lias just been present
ed to you as the best thing since night baseball,"
said Bush's recount manager, former Secretary
of StateJames A. Baker 111. He said, in fact, the
order "does nothing more than preserve the

status quo."
Bush running mate* Dick Cheney said the
state's official count and recount showed Bush
was the winner — with the overseas absentees
still to come — and l>.u ring am change he ex
pee ted Secretary of State Katlierine Harris to
dec lare Bush the winner tomorrow.
Cheney said in an interview with Fox News
Channel that recounts In hand do not give a
more accurate result, "li is no longer really
c ounting, it is manipulation."' he said.
I he seven-member Floi ida court, all chosen
by Democratic governors, issued its unani
mous, one-paragraph order as Bush lawyers
looked to a federal appeals court in Atlanta to
stop the recounts altogether.

()ne of the four counties, Volusia, complet
ed its new tally in time to meet a 5 p.m. Tuesday
deadline established by 1 lan is. She has said the
state will not include any of the post-Tuesday
recount figures in its official tabulation, which
she intends to annouru e tomorrow.
In another county, Miami-Dade, officials
said thev would meet today to decide whether
to proceed.
Republicans, meanwhile, released federal
court affidavits from at least five witnesses who
contend they watched earlier hand recounts in
l'alm Beach County this week and observed ir
regularities and possible ballot tampering.

"l personally observed (Canvass
ing Board counters 'twisting' and
otherwise manipulating the paper
ballots in an attempt to dislodge
chads from the ballots them
selves," Mark I', klirnek, an ob
server of the Palm Beach County
hand recount, wrote in an affi
davit.
As for the state Supreme Court
ruling, Burton said it did not ap

pear to cover the underlying ques
tion of whether the results of the
handcounts must be rolled into the
official vote totals.
"I would imagine that's going to
be the next round of litigation," he
said.
"The order allows us to begin
the recounting process. That's
what we intend to do," Burton
said, adding it could take as long as
six days to complete.
I he issue lias been simmering
for several days but was given new
urgency In Harris' decision that
ballots recounted after last lues

day would not matter.
Democrats urged the justices to
rule quickly because counties
didn't know if they should keep
counting.
Gore's chief lawyer, David
Boies, interpreted the ruling as a
signal to Harris that she shouldn't
ignore the late tallies.
"I think it's very unlikely that
the Florida Supreme Court would
have directed that these counts go
forward if all they meant to do was
preserve these votes for history,"
Boies said.
Separately, a state judge heard

Gore's argument yesterday that
I larris ought to count the late tal
lies in her final total.
I hat final total will determine
which candidate captures Floi ida's
25 Flee tot al College votes and
thus, almost certainly, the White
I louse.
C lire uit Judge l erry Lewis, a
Democrat, will not rule until this
morning at the earliest on Gore's
request to indefinitch extend the
deadline for (ounties to submit re
vised < ounts.
Lewis had ruled earlier in the
week that while Harris could en

force the state's one-week deadline
for filing vote tallies, she had flexi
bility in deciding whether some
counties might need more time.
Harris contributed to delays in
getting the counts done, and then
punished the counties for not fin
ishing on time, (iore lawyer Dexter
1 )ouglass argued.
"It's like when a police officer
savs stop, and a line of cars backs
up behind von . . . and then lie
gives von a tic ket for bloc king traf
fic," Douglass said.
A lawyer for Harris, |oe Klock,
said she acted scrupulously to 10l

low Florida law and Lewis's order.
"Rather than violating the
order <>t this court, we paid partic
ular attention to following the or
ders <>! this court,' he argued.
K<>tl> campaigns also awaited
word from a federal appeals court
that has agreed to hear liush's con
stitutional challenge to the re
counts.
liush asked the lltli U.S. Cir
cuit Court of Appeals to stop the
hand counts pending a ruling on
whether rhev violate voters' rights
to be treated equally under the
law.
