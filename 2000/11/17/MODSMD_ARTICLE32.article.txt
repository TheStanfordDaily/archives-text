li isn't siii|>iisiiij4 that the No. 21 Stan
ford women's vllevball team wasn't entire-
Is satisfied with its 3-0 win over Oregon last
night. I hough the team came awa\' with a
"W," it was anything bnt routine.
"Ii was like a roller toaster,' freshman
middle blot ker Sara Mc( >ee said.
1 lie ( Ordinal (l(">-1 1,9-8 Pacific 10 (Con
ference) dominated mncli of the match as
Oregon (10-Hi, 2-15) struggled offensively
throughout the night. Kiit several (Cardinal
lapses ,ii)(l a neai colossal collapse in the
second game left a sour aftertaste for main
on Stanford's side of the court.
"We have a tendency to start strong and

then relax a little too much," said sopho
more outside hitler Logan loin. "We let
the other teams hack into it too often. We
need to keep the excitement up and push
through the matches better."
From looking at the numbers, it would
be hard to tell that Stanford struggled .it all
during the mate h. I lie (Cardinal lacked up
.i .372 atia< k percentage for the night, tally
ing 5N kills to ()regon's 29 while outblock
ing the Due ks H-4.
But the numbers don't tell the whole
storv, as the struggling Ducks were able to
take the (Cardinal out of its game for s tret c li
es at .i time.
" I he parts <>1 the match where we were
struggling, we were definitely playing
down to their level," s.iid junior middle

bloc kcr I ara (Conrad. 'When we got our
selves back into our game, we really start
ed to dominate."
Stanford started the match strong while
()regon looked entirely disoriented on the
court. Seniorsettei Lindsay kagawa picked
up two of her four ac es early on as the (Car
dinal ran off an early 6-1 lead.
Hie Ducks came alive midway through
the game, however, and Stanford struggled
i<> build momentum. A late timeout picked
up the (Cardinal and Stanford pulled out a
I 5-8 win. The (Cardinal outliit ()regon .452
to . IX2 in the first game.
Stanford came out swinging in game two
as well, stretching an early 1-2 lead into a
I 4-3 advantage. Then something went ter
ribly wrong on the (Cardinal's side of the

court.
Stanford failed to convert on six game
points as the Ducks pulled off an unbeliev
able comeback. The Ducks pulled to within
two of the (Cardinal at 14-12 when Stanford
called its second and final timeout of the
game.
During the timeout the Stanford squad
regained its composure and finally scored
that elusive last point fbra 15-12 victory.
"1 wasn't too nervous," said (Conrad on
the Ducks' run in the second game. "I
thought ii was kind of ridiculous, but I
knew we were going to pull it out."
Stanford kept its composure for most of
game three, storing the first nine points of
the game. I lowever, Stanford again looked
unsettled on the court as ()rcgon pulled to

within four at 9-5. lint Stanford responded
quickly this time, storing six points in a row
to finish off the match 15-5.
"[Oregon] is a hard team to scout," said
interim head coach Denise Corlett. I hey
plav a weird offense and they're at the bot
tom of the I'ac -10, so maybe we didn't come
in as fired up as we needed to be."
Tom led the (lardinal with 17 kills while
hitting .it a .036 clip. McGee hit a career
high .SIS for the- night while posting 10
kills. Freshman middle blocker Jenn Har
vey came off the bench to pick up six blocks
tor the- match.
Stanford returns to action tonight
against Oregon State (15-13, 5-11) for its
last l'ac -10 match of the season. I irst serve
is at 7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
