# Cardinal Today
## Long road leads to Big showdown in Berkeley 
### MATT LONG STAFF WRITER 
Kverv Sianlbrd played this season
was a prat ticc game.
I lie comeback upset of Texas was a
dull in determination. I lie last-minute
tout lidow n to beat US(. was merely an ex
en ise in composure and courage. The
heartwrent liing loss to Washington
taught about the agony ol defeat.
A season of coutinuos practice lias to
lead somewhere, and this season it is Sat
urday I lie 10.3rd big Game. I lie 00-
niiimie season at (lal's Memorial Stadium.

I his year's winner of the battle that di
vides the Bay Area will not go to the Rose
Bowl. In fact, both teams will celebrate the
end of their seasons after Big Game. Both
Gal (3-7, 2-5 Pacific 10 (Conference) and
Stanford (4-b, 3-4) have suffered enough
this year.
But when the (Cardinal faithful look,
back .it the 2000 lootball season, few will
retail Stanford's near win over UGLA.
When the Bear Backers hearken back to
this (all. Gal's blown 11-point fourth quar
ter lead against No. 9 Washington may be
lorg( itten.
With the tides of Big (lame ride the

hopes of a season. Win, and Stanford will
t oast the wave of victory into next season
and retain the Axe fora record sixth
straight year. Lose, and the Garditial
hands the (herished blade over to it> hated
rival, leaving the seniors with little to show
fora disappointing year.
I he Stanford seniors have never lived
through the pain of watching ()skie and
his (iolden Beat s prance around wit 11 the
Axe. They have never lost to Gal.
Watching (Cardinal players parading
with the Axe after the game is the closest
that Gal seniors have come to Stanford's
treasured relic. Surely, they want to feel

the cold steel resting in their grasp once
again.
Along with the seniors, Stanford coach
fyrone Willingham has never experi
enced a loss to Gal. I'.ven the usually sioi<
Willingham cannot help but indulge in the
excitement surrounding this year's game.
I le knows the prize is pride and the moti
vation is to compete.
"As we approach tins football game, it is
one that at all points in the year, you have
some knowledge of it and keep some ref
erence of as you work though the year,"
said Willingham. "It's been a season of
great wins and neat misses. It's the conibi

nation of those tli.it li.is brought us to this
point."
Both teams have had theii share of peaks
and valleys this vear, and I»<>th have played

where Big (Jame will be won or lost.
Quarterbacks
Stanford junior Randy Fasani
<ind Cal sophomore Kyle Boiler
throw on the run often and will be
lorced to ibis weekend against tal
ented pass rushes.
It is the first Big Came start
for both, and if Fasani can man
age to make it through the game
without aggravating either his
injured toe or knee, he can cre
ate havoc with his aggressive
scrambling. II not, redshirt
freshman Chris Lewis will enter
and may find it difficult to pass
against a defense that leads the
Pac-10 in sacks.
()n a side note, Fasanis parents
went lo Cal, and though he grew
up watching'the Bears, he got
older and more mature" and came
to the Farm.
Advantage: Slight edge to Stan
lbrd with Fasani, otherwise even.
Running backs
After averaging 129 yards and
scoring just one rushing touch
down in the first six games. Cardi
nal backs have stepped tip for 176
yards a game and 10 scores in the
last four.
Kerry Carter leads Stanford
with six touchdowns and 4.3 yards
per carry. Fellow sophomore |oe
Igber spearheads the Bears tun
ning game, averaging H1.2 vards

per game and 4.5 per carry while
also compiling 2.'W yards on recep
tions. Cal's defensive line should
be able to contain the Cardinal's
loss sweep.
Advantage: ( al.
Receivers
Last week, Oeßonnie Pitts
moved into second place all-lime
in Pac -10 receptions. 1 lis catch
es per game tie him for fourth in
the NC lA\, and in his last collegiate
game, the consistent senior will be
fired up to boost his league-lead
ing seven receiving touchdowns.
Add to the mix speedy red shirt
freshman Luke Powell's 26.7 yards
a catch, and either Cardinal quar
terback is sure to find open targets
in the secondary. Sophomore
Derek Swallord leads Cal with I")
receiving yards per game.
Advantage: Stanford.
Offensive line
Cal's offense is next to last in the
Pac-10; Stanford's is sixth. Willing
ham attributes much of the (lardi
nal's tunning improvement in the
second half of the season to the
hard work and teamwork of the
line.
I he Bears have struggled to
find chemistry with 10 different
lineman in the starting lineup
throughout the season .
Advantage: Stanford.
Defensive line
Its hard to find a defensive line
better than senior All-American
Willie Howard and his Trench
Dogs, unless that line is anchored

by (la I senior defensive end Andre
Carter. Sports Illustrated named
C '.arter one of the top ten defensive
players in the nation, and Willing
ham called him "truly one of the
best players in the country."
Advantage: Cal
Linebackers
Stanford's Coy Wire was last
week's Pac-10 Defensive Player of
the Week after a l()-tackle, three
sack game. Riall Johnson leads the
Pac-10 with 14 sac ks. Linebacker is
Stanford's defensive strength. Cal
starts two unproven sophomores
at this position.
Advantage: Stanford.
Secondary
Neither team is dynamic
against the pass. Cal li.is created
more turnovers than Stanford, but
have allowed more yards and
touchdowns. With both teams
looking to pass, the secondary per
formance may be the game's de
ciding point.
Advantage: Kven.
Game Time
Given the parih between these
teams, Willingham breaks the
game down into much simpler
terms.
"The best way to win the foot
ball game is to play as a team," he
said. "If you c an limit vour mis
takes and make critical plays at
the right time — if you can do
those things, then you give your
self a chance. If you get one of the
nic e bounces of the ball, then you
end tip as the victor."

where Big (Jame will be won or lost.
Quarterbacks
Stanford junior Randy Fasani
<ind Cal sophomore Kyle Boiler
throw on the run often and will be
lorced to ibis weekend against tal
ented pass rushes.
It is the first Big Came start
for both, and if Fasani can man
age to make it through the game
without aggravating either his
injured toe or knee, he can cre
ate havoc with his aggressive
scrambling. II not, redshirt
freshman Chris Lewis will enter
and may find it difficult to pass
against a defense that leads the
Pac-10 in sacks.
()n a side note, Fasanis parents
went lo Cal, and though he grew
up watching'the Bears, he got
older and more mature" and came
to the Farm.
Advantage: Slight edge to Stan
lbrd with Fasani, otherwise even.
Running backs
After averaging 129 yards and
scoring just one rushing touch
down in the first six games. Cardi
nal backs have stepped tip for 176
yards a game and 10 scores in the
last four.
Kerry Carter leads Stanford
with six touchdowns and 4.3 yards
per carry. Fellow sophomore |oe
Igber spearheads the Bears tun
ning game, averaging H1.2 vards

per game and 4.5 per carry while
also compiling 2.'W yards on recep
tions. Cal's defensive line should
be able to contain the Cardinal's
loss sweep.
Advantage: ( al.
Receivers
Last week, Oeßonnie Pitts
moved into second place all-lime
in Pac -10 receptions. 1 lis catch
es per game tie him for fourth in
the NC lA\, and in his last collegiate
game, the consistent senior will be
fired up to boost his league-lead
ing seven receiving touchdowns.
Add to the mix speedy red shirt
freshman Luke Powell's 26.7 yards
a catch, and either Cardinal quar
terback is sure to find open targets
in the secondary. Sophomore
Derek Swallord leads Cal with I")
receiving yards per game.
Advantage: Stanford.
Offensive line
Cal's offense is next to last in the
Pac-10; Stanford's is sixth. Willing
ham attributes much of the (lardi
nal's tunning improvement in the
second half of the season to the
hard work and teamwork of the
line.
I he Bears have struggled to
find chemistry with 10 different
lineman in the starting lineup
throughout the season .
Advantage: Stanford.
Defensive line
Its hard to find a defensive line
better than senior All-American
Willie Howard and his Trench
Dogs, unless that line is anchored

by (la I senior defensive end Andre
Carter. Sports Illustrated named
C '.arter one of the top ten defensive
players in the nation, and Willing
ham called him "truly one of the
best players in the country."
Advantage: Cal
Linebackers
Stanford's Coy Wire was last
week's Pac-10 Defensive Player of
the Week after a l()-tackle, three
sack game. Riall Johnson leads the
Pac-10 with 14 sac ks. Linebacker is
Stanford's defensive strength. Cal
starts two unproven sophomores
at this position.
Advantage: Stanford.
Secondary
Neither team is dynamic
against the pass. Cal li.is created
more turnovers than Stanford, but
have allowed more yards and
touchdowns. With both teams
looking to pass, the secondary per
formance may be the game's de
ciding point.
Advantage: Kven.
Game Time
Given the parih between these
teams, Willingham breaks the
game down into much simpler
terms.
"The best way to win the foot
ball game is to play as a team," he
said. "If you c an limit vour mis
takes and make critical plays at
the right time — if you can do
those things, then you give your
self a chance. If you get one of the
nic e bounces of the ball, then you
end tip as the victor."
Kverv Sianlbrd played this season
was a prat ticc game.
I lie comeback upset of Texas was a
dull in determination. I lie last-minute
tout lidow n to beat US(. was merely an ex
en ise in composure and courage. The
heartwrent liing loss to Washington
taught about the agony ol defeat.
A season of coutinuos practice lias to
lead somewhere, and this season it is Sat
urday I lie 10.3rd big Game. I lie 00-
niiimie season at (lal's Memorial Stadium.

I his year's winner of the battle that di
vides the Bay Area will not go to the Rose
Bowl. In fact, both teams will celebrate the
end of their seasons after Big Game. Both
Gal (3-7, 2-5 Pacific 10 (Conference) and
Stanford (4-b, 3-4) have suffered enough
this year.
But when the (Cardinal faithful look,
back .it the 2000 lootball season, few will
retail Stanford's near win over UGLA.
When the Bear Backers hearken back to
this (all. Gal's blown 11-point fourth quar
ter lead against No. 9 Washington may be
lorg( itten.
With the tides of Big (lame ride the

hopes of a season. Win, and Stanford will
t oast the wave of victory into next season
and retain the Axe fora record sixth
straight year. Lose, and the Garditial
hands the (herished blade over to it> hated
rival, leaving the seniors with little to show
fora disappointing year.
I he Stanford seniors have never lived
through the pain of watching ()skie and
his (iolden Beat s prance around wit 11 the
Axe. They have never lost to Gal.
Watching (Cardinal players parading
with the Axe after the game is the closest
that Gal seniors have come to Stanford's
treasured relic. Surely, they want to feel

the cold steel resting in their grasp once
again.
Along with the seniors, Stanford coach
fyrone Willingham has never experi
enced a loss to Gal. I'.ven the usually sioi<
Willingham cannot help but indulge in the
excitement surrounding this year's game.
I le knows the prize is pride and the moti
vation is to compete.
"As we approach tins football game, it is
one that at all points in the year, you have
some knowledge of it and keep some ref
erence of as you work though the year,"
said Willingham. "It's been a season of
great wins and neat misses. It's the conibi

nation of those tli.it li.is brought us to this
point."
