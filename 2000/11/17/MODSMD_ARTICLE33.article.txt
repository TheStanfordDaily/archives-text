Kverv Sianlbrd played this season
was a prat ticc game.
I lie comeback upset of Texas was a
dull in determination. I lie last-minute
tout lidow n to beat US(. was merely an ex
en ise in composure and courage. The
heartwrent liing loss to Washington
taught about the agony ol defeat.
A season of coutinuos practice lias to
lead somewhere, and this season it is Sat
urday I lie 10.3rd big Game. I lie 00-
niiimie season at (lal's Memorial Stadium.

I his year's winner of the battle that di
vides the Bay Area will not go to the Rose
Bowl. In fact, both teams will celebrate the
end of their seasons after Big Game. Both
Gal (3-7, 2-5 Pacific 10 (Conference) and
Stanford (4-b, 3-4) have suffered enough
this year.
But when the (Cardinal faithful look,
back .it the 2000 lootball season, few will
retail Stanford's near win over UGLA.
When the Bear Backers hearken back to
this (all. Gal's blown 11-point fourth quar
ter lead against No. 9 Washington may be
lorg( itten.
With the tides of Big (lame ride the

hopes of a season. Win, and Stanford will
t oast the wave of victory into next season
and retain the Axe fora record sixth
straight year. Lose, and the Garditial
hands the (herished blade over to it> hated
rival, leaving the seniors with little to show
fora disappointing year.
I he Stanford seniors have never lived
through the pain of watching ()skie and
his (iolden Beat s prance around wit 11 the
Axe. They have never lost to Gal.
Watching (Cardinal players parading
with the Axe after the game is the closest
that Gal seniors have come to Stanford's
treasured relic. Surely, they want to feel

the cold steel resting in their grasp once
again.
Along with the seniors, Stanford coach
fyrone Willingham has never experi
enced a loss to Gal. I'.ven the usually sioi<
Willingham cannot help but indulge in the
excitement surrounding this year's game.
I le knows the prize is pride and the moti
vation is to compete.
"As we approach tins football game, it is
one that at all points in the year, you have
some knowledge of it and keep some ref
erence of as you work though the year,"
said Willingham. "It's been a season of
great wins and neat misses. It's the conibi

nation of those tli.it li.is brought us to this
point."

and valleys this vear, and I»<>th have played
