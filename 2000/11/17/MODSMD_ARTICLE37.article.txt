It's the Kyle Bowl: Quarter
hack Kvle Boiler ol (lal vs. Stan
lord QB Kyle Matter.
It is likely that vcr\ lew people
have yet to hear about these two
young guns. Boiler is <i sopho
more at (lal, and Mattel. who said
he li.is "100 percent" verhall)
committed to Stanford, is still ,i
senior quarterback in high
school.

I lie similarities do not end
with their first names. Boiler is .i
graduate ol 11 art I ligh School in
New hall, (lalif., the same school
Mattel currently attends. Kach
has led Hart to California Inter
scholastic Federation Southern
Sec t ion Division 111 tit le s
Boiler in 1098, and Matter in
1000.
I n his one season as I lart's
quarterback, Boiler was an All-
American, setting the California

si,iic passing record. throwing for
4,851 yards, with 59 tout hdowns
and only three interceptions. Ik
was the most highly touted re
< mil in Southern ('.alilornia, and
started for ('.al as a true freshman
l.ist year.
"Kvle | Boiler| was <i tremen
dous quarterback and he did <111
ama/ing job. Ik- li.kl one ol the
l>esi arms to corne from Southern
California since |ohn Klway,"
said 11.111 lligli School coach
Mike I lerrington (who likes com
paring current Cal quarterbacks
to ex-Stanford quarterbacks . . .
go figure).
'I'hen, before Matter even got
a ( hance to prove his capabilities
as boiler's successor at Hart
lligli, he faced main compar
isons 111 the local papers, which
had already decided Boiler's
shoes would be impossible to fill.
Boy, were they wrong.

team. Matter has become Hart
lligli School's career passing
leader with 6,307 yards and 72
touchdowns.
"Kvle |Matter| is .111 outstand
ing athlete, and lie's got a great
knowledge ol the game," said
I lerrington. "lie's probably the
most intelligent quarterback
we've ever had."

"I was woo/v but I wanted to
get back 111 the game, so when the
coat lies weren't looking, I had
one ol the linemen remind me
what it was," Matter said.
Now, that's Stanford material.
Of course, in all fairness to

"Kyle Bowl" is not a sure thing —

Matter, now a senior at Hart High School in Newhill, Calif.
