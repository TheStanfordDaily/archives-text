Big Game is a storied rivalry be
tween Stanford and California that
defies all odds and ignores .ill logic.
Nobody on earth ever knows who
will win the game. For Stanford and
Cal fans, Big Game transcends the
sport of football.
lliroiighoiit the past two
decades. Big Game lias become a
way for Stanford fans to forget
about the first 10 games of the sea
son and to demonstrate Stanford's
superiority over its long-time rival,
representing the salvation of Stan
ford's football season. However,
outside the campuses of Stanford
and Cal, Big (lame lias become
overshadowed by nationally tele
vised football games and profes
sional sports.
Yet Big (lame used to have a
tremendous impact not only for the
two Bay-Area rivals but also for the
entire West Coast. Because the Bay
area did not have any professional
sports at the turn of thecentury, Big
Game became the biggest sporting
event on the West Coast for many
years, drawing thousands of fans
from all over ( alifornia.
The 101-game-old series began
during the 1891-1892 school year
after a veteran California football
team ( hallenged newborn Stanford
I niversit\ to a football game in the
fall <>l 1891. John Whittemore, a

transfer student who began toorga
nize a football team at Stanford, de
clined the challenge at first but later
accepted it during the spring.
I he two schools met at a sandlot
near I laight and Stanyan Streets in
San Francisco on March 19, 1892.
About 20,000 spectators crowded
the field that day as Stanford stu
dent manager Herbert Hoover col
lected more than $30,000 in tickets
at the gate.
l he game was about to begin
when the referee discovered that
neither club brought a football to
the field (Some sources say that it
was Hoover who forgot to bring the
ball.) Luckily, the owner of a local
sporting goods store was in the
crowd and while he rode oil on
horseback to get a ball, the crowd
waited anxiously for more than an
hour.
()nce the game started, Stanford
leaped out to <i 14-0 lead and held
on fora 14-10 upset of the heavily
favored and much more experi
enced Cal squad, beginning Stan
lord's long-standing tradition of de
feating the (iolden Bears.
Even then, Cal fans found ways
to justify their losses. Following a
controversial Stanford touchdown
in 1894, .i Cal student newspaper
reporter commented, "(Stanford]
won by a lluke and a referee . . .
I li.it is the only just verdict that can
be passed. I do not mean to insinu
ate that the referee was in any way
influenced to take a Stanford view
of the game; but I do mean he does
not know a touchdown when lie
sees it."
