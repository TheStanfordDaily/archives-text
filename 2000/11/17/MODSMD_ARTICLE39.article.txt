This story originally ran in the Stanford I huh on
Nov. 21,1982.

BERKELEY — (>rnia captured the
sr>ili and best Big (iamc Saturday with a
chaotic and controversial 57-yard kickoll
return ili.it never could have happened,
hut did.
(ial used five laterals on the return be
fore defensive back Kevin Moen took the
blind final pitch and crashed 25 yards
through the Stanford band and into the
end /one fora 25-20 win.
Moments later the official ruled ii a
touchdown, and (lal lans poured onto the
field, engulfing the Bear players and re
placing the Stanford fans, players and
band, main of whom were on the field
prematurely.
Mark Harmon had seemingly won the
game for Stanford with a 35-vard field goal
with eight seconds remaining. The field
goal was set up by a final-minute John
Klwav-led drive.
Stanford stood .it fbinth-and-17 from
their own 13-yard line with 58 seconds re
maining. Klway stood in his pocket — that
gave him all the time he needed to hit
Emile I larry with a 29-yard bullet upheld.
The drive eventually led to Harmon's
dramatic field goal and the Stanford bench
piled onto the field, causing a 15-yard un
sportsmanlike conduct penalty.
I larmon then ku ked oil from the Sum
lord 25-yard line toset in mot ion one of the
most bizarre episodes to ever occur on an
American loothall field.
1 larmon's squib kick was fielded by
Moen at the Cal 43-yard line. Moen was
immediately covered and he pitched back
to Richard Rodgers near midfield.
Rodgers, who also found nowhere to
run, was hit but lateralled to Dwight (iar
ner. (iarner was swarmed by Stanford de
fenders and driven backwards. Two play
ers charged onto the field from Stanford's
bench to celebrate and were followed by
the Stanford band. Penalty flags flew as the
field was flooded with scrambling people.
Suddenly the ball squirted from (iar
ner's arms back to Rodgers.
"1 swear, my knee never hit the
ground," Ciarner said, "I was just about to
fall, and then I saw Rodgers. I remember

his saving in the huddle, 'Don't fall with the
ball.'"
Rodgers rambled upheld toward the
Stanford band and the bath o! confusion at
that end of the field before pitching the ball
to Mariet lord who headed for the right
sideline.
lord rat ed to the 20-yard line where he
blindh Hipped the ball backwards over his
head. Moen was there to catch ilie pass and
he charged through the band and into the
end /one.
"We knew we had to keep the ball alive,"
said Moen, who along with Rodgers, was a
veer quarterback in high school. "I saw
maybe one white jersey and just tucked the
ball away. I wasn't going to stop for the
band. I was going to score."
"There were so many people on the
field I didn't see any Stanford players,"
Rodgers said. "I don't think they knew
what was going on."
l he officials huddled on (lie field and
moments later signaled a touchdown.
Stanford players argued that an official
had ( ailed the play dead at midfield.
"I saw one official do this implying he
was down," said noseguard Terry Jackson,
moving his arms back-and-forth like a
baseball umpire signaling safe. "Then 1
saw this guy running with the ball. I didn't
know what the hell was going on."
"They robbed us of our victory. I have
been involved with some wild things in
high school games, but this outdoes them
all. It's hard for me to take. I would feel bet
ter ii they would have beaten our kickoll
team fair-and-square, not this Mickey
Mouse stuff."
Reletee Charles Moflctt, in a taped re
sponse to reporters questions, said, "We
checked that. Nobody thought he was
down at any time."
Moflett also explained that the penalty
flags were thrown because of the Stanford
players on the field and that they could
have penalized the Stanford band also.
"All 1 heard from the referee was that as
soon as Kevin [Moen] touched a band
member, it was a touchdown," said C.al
tight end David Lewis.
Stanford coach Paul Wiggin was vehe
ment after the game.
"I feel it was grossly unfair," Wiggin
said. "I feel the last play was illegal. We saw
it on the sidelines as dead. The guy [Moen]

never would have scored if we didn't think
the |>la\ was dead. This is the biggest fiasco
of all time. I think it's tragic that a ('al-Stan-
Ibrd game comes down to this.'"
Gordy C.eresino, former Cardinal linc
backer and now a television commentator,
said, "The third man [Garner] was
stopped, lie was struggling Ibrward and
then pushed hack to stop his momentum.
Both knees hit the ground belbre the hall
came out."
"On the replays it's fairly clear. I saw it
25 times. The question wasn't really so
nun h whether his knee touched, although
it looked like they did, but his lack ol mo
mentum. I le was stopped."
Stanford athletic director Andy Geiger
said, "I don't know ol any mechanism |to
appeal the game]."
(.alilbrnia jumped out to.i 10-0 halltime
lead on another controversial call.
Willi less than three minutes remaining
in the first half, quarterback Gail Gilbert
lofted a 26-yard pass to Ford in the end
