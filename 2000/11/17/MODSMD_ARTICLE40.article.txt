Lewis demonstrated remarkable composure in the
pocket, belying the fact that the game wasonlv the sec
ond of his collegiate career.
1 .ewis said thai remaining poised under pressure has
never been a problem in his sports career. "I don t get
nervous," he saw "I will the first pla\ tnaylx.* but after
that I don't. I was even (aim in ilial last drive against
Texas."
Head coach I'yrone Willingham I eels little need to
worn about Lewis's lack of experience, deferring to
Lewis's natural athletic ability.
"I le'sbeen .t (jn.n tet hack lor some time, he s worked
on the position, and he has an understanding ol the po

In lewis, the Cardinal coaching stall has an high

When asked whether Johnson will be awarded play

uncertainty.
Stanford's talent at I lie quarterback position remains
a high point ol the lootball program. el the question
remains as to whethei Lewis (oi |ohnson) can lead the

Nonetheless, the (Cardinal needs a star quarterback
to establish its place in the conference — and quickly.
"When we talk about defining our learn in 2000,'
Willingham savs, "we're talking about identifying a
quarterback and his role.
