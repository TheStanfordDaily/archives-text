You might say that Heitmann was the

Heitmann garnered first-team .-Mi-American
honors in high school and came lo Stanford
amid as much hype as any lineman in school his

All Pac-10. But the (i-lix)t-4,295-pound compos
er still writes music.
"Football is such an emotional sport, wins and
losses, peaks and valleys, so whenever I write a
song there's a lot of emotion that goes into the
pieces I create," says 1 leitmann. "I think a lot of
limes the emotions from football can transcend
to the piano pieces that I play."
Heitmann's emotional passion lor the game
rings evident when lie levels the top linebackers
in the league, begging the question of the secret
to Stanford's recent running success. Cardinal
running backs have begun to compile impressive
numbers, but those may not be so much a prod
uct of their improvement as a testimony to the
development of the offensive line.
"Lineman are the core of the football team,
says head coach l yrone Willingham. "Without
their success, there's no success am where. 11 leit

mann'sj skill level on and oil the field allows him
to possess the maturity to lend a hand to others.
I lis dedication to he a great player ruhs oil On
others arotmd him."
But alter a third-and-short play where the
linemen surge into the opposing defense, open
ing up a hole big enough lor a first down, the
loudspeaker booms with the name of the ballcar
rier. What the announcer tails to note is that the
ollense owes the continuation of t hat drive to the
linemen's intensity.
But Neumann and his compatriots must be
content, fora lineman's success is the success of
his team, not personal statistics. Blocking is about
being unselfish.
" I hat's something that being an ollensive
lineman you come to accept," Heitmann says.
"When I hear the running back's name lor get
ting that extra yard, I know myself that we were
the ones helping him on that play. That's
enough lor us."
I lie only personal recognition Heitmann
c raves comes at the finish of each season, when
the \( AA honors its All-,Americans. I le is deter
mined to make that list, and to secure a future for
himself in professional lootball.
"I thinka lot about m\ possibility of playing in
the next league," Heitmann says."I think that
what I've got to do is just sta\ healthy and keep
improving each week. Hopefully I'll get the op
portunity to be successful at the next level."
And in the NI L, the songs will only become
sweeter.
