I .< >valtv, strength and com age are I he watchwords of
a samurai warrior. ()nly one who respects his rcxMs,
demonstrates power in the line of duly and dares lo set
goals beyond the ordinal")' is worthy lo cany llie samu
rai blade.
When Riall johnsou brought an actual samurai
blade into the locker room ai the beginning of the 1999
.season, he sought to c hannel that same warrior spirit
onto the football field. During the Pacific 10 Conference
ojK'ner against Washington State, the filth-year senior
outside linebacker sliced through the opposing ollense
lo record five sac ks, including a fourth quarter safety.
1 he Pac-10 honored him as Defensive Player of the
Week, and 1 iis ancient weapon has been sheathed at
even battle since.
I he sword traveled to I S( la few weeks later as John
son's three tackles fora loss, two sacks and forced fum
ble slew the'lVojans in an upset comeback win, 1.
lie brought the sword this season when he attacked
then-No. "> lexas and c ame away with lour tackles for
l< >ssesand three sacks, garnering the USA I oday Pac-10
( onlerence Player of the Week award.
I he sword |olmson totes to each game is the medi
um version of a three-part set given to him by his older
brother Ahmani, who was a standout at linebacker for
()regon Stale and went on to play several years in the
(Canadian football League. The swords have become a
sort of lamilv heirloom, but no one will mistake the (V.'V,
2 10 pound Johnson lot a native of Japan.
"| Ahmani | plaved 'Sam' backer, which is what I play,
ind at bis school they called it samurai backer," Johnson
explains. "1 like to think of lootball as going to war. I o
me 11he swords are] something to help get your mind
tight, to get that warrior mentality. "

Johnson's most notable role on the battlefield is that
of quarterback-slayer. List vear he led the conference
with 13 sac ks, and was decorated as second-team All-
Pac-10. This season he is on pace to beat that total, with
eight sacks alter six games. C )pposing coac lies have
begun specially preparing their ollenses to deal
with Riall's onslaught -but usualh to no avail.
"You have to figure out some wa\ lo contain and
stop him," said Stanford head coach I \ rone Will-

ingham. "He finds a new wa\ ever\ week lo
get to the quarterback."
Johnson's success is partly clue t< >a p< >si- m
tion change before last season, where he
moved from defensive end to outside *
linebacker. The 'Sam' backer is a position
that better suits his quickness and anticipa-

tion than the defensive line.
Willingham praised the
hard work Johnson put into
perfecting his defensive ad
justment-yet it shouldn't be
surprising, given that Johnson
always holds himself to high
standards.
"Personally, I want to go
back to the Rose Bowl. I hat's
the first thing." said Johnson

"I'm hoping to go lor All-American. I'm going !<>i ilie*
Hutkus Trophy [given annually to the nation's Ik-si
linebacker]. I'm still on the list lor ii; il'noi then at least
I set my goals high. II I'm close enough then I'll si ill he
satisfied."
I lis competitiveness is natural, given that he grew up
in a family of elite athletes. Horn in Lynwood, Wash..
Johnson watched his older brother dominate on the
Held, providing a basis lor his own excellence.
"I would not be as good a l<x>tball player il it wasn't
for my older brother," |ohnson said. "I Its my inspira
tion and my hero, lie's who I watched growing up.

Othei people had pro players, bill I had someone close
to me lo model mysell alier."
Being raised in Ahmani's sliadow instilled a fire in
|ohnson to surpass his brother. That llame has now
been passed on to Riall's little brother, 1 eyo, though the
(i' 7", 25(>pound Stanlbrd freshman can hardly be
called little. 1 eyo was a prized recruit both as a quarter
back and as a forward on the basketball team, and Riall
was instrumental in 1 eyo's decision to join the Cardinal.
"It has helped me discipline myself being here at
Stanlbrd,"'said Riall. "You reali/eyou have lobe on top
ol everything, you're on your own here; you're not

pampered like you are at oilier schools. That's
one of the reasons 1 told mv little brother to

come here, cause I wanted him to be able to
experience this."

Riall's competitiveness definitely ex
tends beyond the playing field. He loves
video games and is open to challengers,
lint Ik- forewarned, he admits that those on
the football team know him as the
(lamemaster. Riall's camaraderie with his
brother this season has matured both
players, and Riall cites Teyo's presence as
a mental advantage to his performance,
providing a chance to relax more than in
past seasons.

"It's a lot more fun having him here
this year on I lie team," Riall said. "We
reminisce on old childhood stufland
I'm goofing around in practice it lot
more 112 think. But I'm still staying fo
cused."
So far this year has been chal
lenging for Riall and the entire
(Cardinal squad as thev have failed
M to live up their own expectations
so far, coining oil l heir Rose Bowl
year. But the talented johnson ex-

pects great tilings lor himself on the gridiron not
only in the remainder oft his season, but in the years that
follow. I le cannot help but think, of the future and the
opportunities awaiting him in his professional career.
"I focus on the now but I do keep the future in
mind, because knowing what 1 could do in the future
can help motivate me for what I c an do now. " John
son said.
What he can do now is continue to conquer the line
of scrimmage, as ollenses fall to the sharp linebacker
that slashes into their backfielcl with the power and de
termination of a samurai.
