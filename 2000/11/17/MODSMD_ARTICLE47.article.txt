Souls is a group ol rappers
Iront Oakland, that ((insists ol
Opio and A-IMus, who handle
most ol tlii' product ion, plus
I ajai and I'hesto I)ee. I hex relx
on then uittx an.ilogies, expan
sive vocabularies, overactive
imaginations and put e l\ i n ,il
skills to talk themselves lip and
put otliei s down. I he formula
works for tlie most part and is a
much welcome break from the
normal talk of wealth, se\ and
linn (let.
Ibex represent a vast devia
tion from everything that is chit
in the hip-hop industrx these
(lax s. I hex tend Io use big words
for their own sake. Ibex ost il
latc from belligerent and liattle
readx to ethereal and literal y. In
true Cliffs Notes stx le, thex label
the tracks 5, 10 and 17 "climax,"
"conflict" and "resolution," re
spet tivelx.
rheir songs aren't e.isx to
identifx oi (lassilx thematit ally,
and their 1 xl its are the kind you
have to think about, so it takes
more than one listen to absorb
I licit message. I be Ivrics roam

and llo.it about like a pleasant
wisp ol smoke waiting to be in
haled. An example ol this is
found tin the song "Acupunc
ture:" "We start a riot like Ja
maicans over gas prices / 1 hat's
why the mass like us / We them
grass lighters."
II nothing else-, the songs tin

"Trilogy" are consistent!) good,
as they should be after five years
of production. The tlist has 18
tracks, which is par for the
course these days, but, unlike
otliei equally length) albums,
" Trilogy" is surprisingly devoid
of fillei.
Kspecially good are tracks like

"Interrogation," a hard core In
spector Clouseau cyborg adven
ture, with lanx-police siren ke\s
blaring over a gangster beat.
"Mama Knows Best" features a
surprise appearance from one ol
the most prolific hip-hop con
tributors, Ceorge Clinton. I lis
meandering vocals back the
whole track and complement the
Innky guitar, laid-back beat,
sweet (horns vocals by Digital
I inlet ground songstress Mvstit
and lvrics reminiscent ol old
school tnakeottt sessions.
The tightest beat, and per
haps the most provocative lyrics,
come on "Snpdoder (What's
The Re?)." All ol the group's
unique qualities synergize on
this mid-tempo, pornographic
track with sudden odes to pim
pology such as, "()nce transfixed
bv my gaze, we moved on to big
get and better nightcaps / To
relax the synapses syntax that
make her want to contact my
mattress."
According to the Souls own
Web site, hieroglyphics.com,
"Like every Souls album before
it, it is comparable to nothing."
