# Third time's the charm for former 'Star'

('..in (>iuii hold his own without

trumpets that make up the heats.
(iuru's provocative thought
pio( css, which comes to lilt* on this
retold, is eniphasi/ed by the har
monic music. I le tackles topic s that
include fatherhood, love and be
trayal, and emotion overflows
from one track to the next.
While cameos on many rap al
bums become ex

cessive and un
necessary, the
guests on this
album comple
ment (iuru per
lc(tl\. Mat \ (iray
appears on "All I
Said," .is (.inn

addresses his woman's worries
about his infidelity. Perhaps the
highlight «>I the .iIImiim occ urs on
"Plenty,'' where (ami and Kr\k.ih

both (.ui ii and the Roots. This
song gives a small sample of what
to expect from the tremendous
tour, which made a stop at San
Kraut isco's Maritime 11.ill last
weekend.
(iuru digs deep into his heart to
disi iiss his imminent fatherhood
on "(iuitlance." I le tells his son, "to
m\ little man / You can nevet have
too little plans / Always bring your
game direct, cut out the middle
man / Life is full of sacrifice, lot
truth vou might have to fight
Someone II bring you down/cause
they ain't liviti right / Be sure to use
your mind, though / Look for all
the signs, yo/ Don't want to make a
move too quick and gel left behind,
v<> Ik' in command of whatever
\ou encounter / Appreciate your
blessings, son, you'll see what it

vour head to the sky."
(>lllll does falter .it moments,
such as on "11 nstlin' I )a/.e," as he I lies
to prove his street credibility. (>lllll is
not revered for his hard-edged
image, l)iit rather his intellect and
wisdom. 1 le also fails with thewhinc\
"No More," where the hook is an
noying and the subject matter of
dumping a wife is played out in rap.
The best of his Ja/./.matazz trilo
gy, (aim's "Jaz/.inata/./. Streetsoul"
is easily his strongest work outside
ol (>angstarr. Nevertheless,- (aim's
will go down as being the incompa
rable emcee of the group.
Although (iangstarr has not bro
ken out into mainstream MTV-land
and never will, (iuru's music will al
ways be cherished by the true hip
hop finis who appreciate the depth
in his lyrics and the art of his I)|-ing.
