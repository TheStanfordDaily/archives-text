# Changing Faces gets a makeover and loses its soul
## Promising R&B group treated to 'corporate' body, mind massage 
### KATE NAUNHEIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The recipe fora successful R&B group is simple:
a few handfiils of creativity-shy record company ex
ecutives, one or two

well-known artists
turned-producers and
a syrupy spoonful of
love songs. A pinch of
talent is always wel
come, but, much like
nuts in brownies, is
usually optional. Stir

half-heartedly, and bake until half-done. 1 hen,
using your smoothest image, frost the hell out <>l it
and serve it up with a lowered gaze to consumers.
Sadly, this stock recipe seems to be quite popular
these days. Ihe New York-based singing duo,
('.hanging Faces, followed this formula to the letter

This would be fine il the
parodic nature of "Visit Me" 1
were inclusive of all the different
styles of R&B. Unfortunately,!
though, this album has succumbed 112
to an unparalleled monotony of
mood, tempo and musical structure.
Although the separation ol the
music into tracks is a clever dis
guise, the album is actually .1 long
sua ession of formless tune.
The first song on the album,,
"Visit Me." was produced b\ R.
I\ell\ and beat s his music al finger
print. Indeed, it shows an almost
frightening resemblance to main
ol his own melodies. "Sittin" here
lonely / wondering il vou're home/
thinkin about < alliti' you / 'cause I
don't wanna be alone" are the
lyrics that open this somewhat se
du< live track. "We could talk about
some things / and haln we could do

some things" they continue.
Things, indeed.
The next track, "That Other
Woman," features two girls lament
ing the situation of being "in love
with another girl's man."
"Ladies Man" thankfully pro
vides ,i slightl\ dillerent beat, as the
girls tell the stor\ of a loathsome
skirt-chaser who is ostensibly bus\
with career responsibilities, but who
in realih is a "ladies man/A playboy
/ A smooth talkin' I)ough trickin' /
Ho piinpin' " sort of fellow. But, in
the end, the singer professes that
she still loves the man.
I lie up-tempo "Last Night" is so
dangerously close to actually en
gaging the listener that it would
not be undue to call it "catchy." But
just when it seems conceivable that

the song could stand on its melod
ic merit, the way the ladies choose
to express their feelings knocks
that merit down. "Don't you want
me / Don't you need me / To give
you kisses/And to hold you tight,"
they croon.
But one of the best songs on the
track is "Doin' to Me," simply be
cause the vocal delivery of
B.R.F. 1.1. (who is featured on this
track) is so apathetic and poorly ex
ecuted that it is laughable; this pro
vides comi( relief from the rest of
the album.
The album does have strong
themes here and there, which is due
largeh to the production. It is a pity
that some potentially lovelv grooves
have been offered up only to be sac
rificed like so main innocent lambs.

I lie two women fail to distinguish
themselves from the mainstream.
Lucas herself described ibis album
as "classic Changing Faces. Ii is not
so rough and not so soli. We hope
that's what makes us stand out."
Cood luck, sweetheart. At this
point, any texture at all would be
appreciated.
It is important not to hate and to
aflord all albums the respect they
deserve. But this album deserves to
be lambasted, not lauded; it should
serve as an example of what is
wrong with slick studio production.
I will leave it to the words of the
sybil of soul. Laurvn I lill: "Music is
supposed to inspire /1 low come we
ain't gettin' no higher?"
