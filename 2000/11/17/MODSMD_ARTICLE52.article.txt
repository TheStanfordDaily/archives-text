Something mnsi he said lor
indie pop done right. In .1 word -
"Hurrah." Since forming in 1991,
the N e w

York-based
quartet, Ver
sus. has been
creating the
sootli i n g
melodies and
articulate gui
tar wi/ardrv

that makes this type of music so
yummy.
Versus is nothing il not consis
tent. Their fourth lull-length re
lease, "Hurrah." pays homage to
both their more mellow influences
and their spasmodic tendencies.
Although more than two-thirds of
the album consists of ballads, it is
nonetheless replete with the
band's trademark, tantalizing,
hook-laden harmonies.

Merge Records

"Hurrah" is Versus's first lull
length album released on Merge
Rec oids. Ihe (lhapel I Jill, North
Carolina-based indie label is fa
mous for such influential bands as
Superchunk and Velocity Girl, as
well .is indie pop guru Stephin
Merritt's various

sonic experiments,
including the wild
ly idoli/.ed group,
rhe Magnetic
Fields. Ihat said,
Versus could have
made a worse
choice when they

decided to move to a new label.
I'erha, >s the best track on the
album, "\J\ Adidas," kicks oil with
a melodic guitar rill that leads into
guitarist and keyboardist Ric hard
llaluyut's wistfully saccharine vo
cals, waxing of "my Adidas laced
with cyanide." The track briefly
mot phs into .1 booming epiphany
of perfectly executed guitar noise
that gives the track an irresistibly
rich texture.

With the exception of "My Adi
das" and "Eskimo on l ire," a rol
licking track that is ardently
melodic and lyrically comical ("So
who's that Eskimo tli.it you took in
from the cold / We'll set him on
lire to try to wake him up"), "I lur
rah" is an album bent on convey
ing the ugh fact that breaking up
is hard to do.
And Versus's take on this theme
is neither trite nor sentimental
characteristics that describe virtu
ally every sonical creation ol the
Britney Spears and Matchbox
Twenty camps. lake away the sen
timentality and you get bald-laced
truth staring you bat kin the I.h e.
"Play Dead" follows a couple as
they discuss splitting up ("We
don't have to pretend we're mar
ried / But we like the company .. .
Maybe letting go / Can save us
from drowning") amid a simple,
airy blend of drums and guitars.
In contrast, "Said Too Much" is
a crescendo toward more bitter
emotions ("I'm not sorry / But you

don't have to worry . . . I'm not
convincing you to stav and sacri
fice your life/Cause I don't really
care that much"), which are re
flected in the more rousing
melodies that peg slower, softer
beats against austere, fiercely gui
tar-rich sounds.
With its tingly folk-inspired
sound, " The Spell You're Under"
is true to the band's Neil Young in
fluence and is reminiscent of
Young's "Harvest Moon." The
song starts out .is .1 sunny, buoyant
tune and launches into a lushly
complex sonic climax where
Baluyut croons, "Don't jump out
the window / You don't need to
run away from it . . . I'll take you
the way you are."
"Walkabout" is a sonically re
freshing track dominated by a rich
piano melody that thankfully dis
tracts from the uninspired lyrics
("Soften your disguise / You're
still hypnotized / By your lucky
charm / You cannot be harmed").
"Shangri-La," released earlier this

year as part of a five-song El\ is
also much more satisfying musi
cally than lyrically ("Holding out
for something more / Do you
know what you're looking for")
and is evocative ol "Atomic Kid,"
Versus's rocking lead-oil track
from their 1998 album, "Two
dents Plus fax."
Whereas Baluyut s voice is
straight-laced, the votal stylings ol
the other lead vocalist and gui
tarist, Fontaine Foups, are ethere
al. Toups fronts "You'll Be Sorrv"
and"I Love the WB," which both
exude a dreamy, moody quality .is
a result. "I Love the WB" is espe
ciall\ hook-laden and 00/.es (lassk
Versus.
With the exceptions of "M> Adi
das," "Eskimo on Fire" and"The
Spell You're Under," the album is
not particularly memorable. Yet u
is solid indie pop, pure and simple
.md will (harm both the die-hard
Versus fan and the garden-variety
indie music devotee. Nip, hip,
"Hurrah" for Versus.
