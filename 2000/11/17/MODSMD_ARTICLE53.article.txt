Outkast's fourth album, "Stanko

standing singles, "Ms. Jackson" and
"B.().B." mark its stylistic extremes:
trippingly slow and rellective on the
low end and outright raucous on the
hit»h end.

The album doesn't lull in between. It starts oil proper
ly with "Gasoline Dreams," a blazing concoction ol live
drums, I lendrix-inspired psychedelic guitars and a hook
ili.it smacks of Public Knemy-esque political discontent:
"Don't everybody like the smell ol gasoline? / Well burn
inuthalucka burn American dreams!"
As if to salve the wounds agitated In this song, the
album then slides into a head-bobbing meal for the senses,
"So Fresh, So (Mean." Another quotable hook empathical
lv infects you with the kind ol narcissistic sell-assurance
that comes from a sharp out lit and a still drink: "Ain t no
bod v dope as me, I 'm just so fresh, so clean / Don't you
think I'm so sexy, I'm just so fresh so clean."

Ms. )a< kson." The beat is set oil by a loop ol
backwards congas, arguably the most bril

liant piect' o( backward instru

mentation since the
Beastie Boys' "Paul

Revere." This heat, however, is not one to get technical
about, hut one to feel. It reflects the content of the song, a
story about familial relations slipping for unforeseen rea
sons. As Di e puts it, "You can plan a pretty picnic but you
can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson.
"I'll call be lore I come" is a song about sexuality th.it
embraces permissive attitudes but stresses that mutual re
spect is essential — an attitude that lias eluded most rap
pers. This concept is embodied by the two female guest
emcees, (iangsta 800 ol Three (> Mafia and Kco, who ac

In addition to furthering the cause of egalitai ianism in
rap, Die does his part to stop the prolifer
