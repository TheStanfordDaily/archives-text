-111,1. The lestival will take place at
the Fine Arts ('.inema Saturday and
Sunday, with screenings starting ai
2 p.m. both days and running until
midnight.
In (bis media marathon, there
.irt' welcome surprises like Ray
mond E. Spiess J r.'s"Dreamer,"an
eight-minute movie about an
Apache man that won Best Short
Feature this year at tin- Sundance
Festival.
Fhe Berkeley lestival is a diver
sity of documentaries ranging
from (lass I'aley's "Wadd, The Life
& Times of John (1.1 lolines," an in
sightful profile of the late adult cin
ema star John (I lolines, to "Born
in the USA," an insider's view of the
role childbirth plays in people's
lives, to the action-packed docu
mentary, "A Kayak Adventure in
Borneo."
The animation genre is repre
sented by ilu' wacky and whimsical
winner of Sundance's Best of the
Festival animation award, "What's
in Heidi's Head," a multidimen
sional computer- and live-action
short. ()n Sunday evening, the les
tival will screen two poignant
movies about contemporary
teenage life, "Bliss" and "People
.ind their Bower," in recognition of
the outstanding work of young Bay
Area media-makers.
Among the longer features, "I
want to Blow Up Silicon Valley"
may be an interesting flick for Stan
ford students satiated with the
Yuppie lifestyle that surrounds us
at the Farm. As the title suggests,
the movie criticizes the accelerated

progress brought by the Internet
industry to this region of Califor
nia. I lu-re are interesting points
raised about development and
growth, .is well .is great scenes of
the Foothills, but "Silicon Valley" is
surprisingly disappointing in tech
nical < |i lalil v.
This year's festival also gives the
audience the chance to reflect on
the history and legacy of

North American Indians.
An integral part of this
country that is usually left
aside in entertainment., tin*
North American Indian, as
well as its cultures and tradi
tions. is present in works
like "Dreamer" and Anne
Makepeaces's "(Homing to
Light: Edward S. Curtis and

the American Indians." In her
movie, Makepeaces masterfully re
veals the photographic legacy of
Curtis and crafts an outstanding
ethnographic document of the
North American Indian.
Fhe highlight of the festival is
the Sundance award-winner and

Academy Award nominee "Dream
er." Sri in lf>29, the movie is a psy
chological ii i|> inside the head ol an
old Apache Indian. From a dream,
he is able to foresee the future of'his
tribe, liis land and his country

(liven the* history of North Ameri
can tribes, his vision is not a happy
one.
But the film uncovers an impor
tant aspect of Indian culture in the
relationship between dreams and
the future. Much ofthe importance
of independent filmmaking is also
evident: Bring to the audience
marginal perspectives that are
often left out l>\ the corporate
media and thereby stimulate dis
cussion. The success of "Dreamer"
is its grasping, creative cinematog
raph) and editing that mixes im
ages, sounds, lears and hopes ofthe
times to come in the mind ofthe
Apache man.
"Dreamer" is not only about
American Indians, but Americans
and the American experience since
(iolumhus as well. (It's all in there.)
The movie starts with a 17th centu
ry scene of wild horses imbued with
a sense th.it Indian lile was indeed
at peace and comfort with itself. But
then the camera moves to battles
between White settlers and Indians
over Indian land — complete with

rapid editing, fantasy-like cine
matography and close-ups showing
the wrinkles in the old Indian's eyes
as he watches the destruction.
As the dream enters the 20th
century, the image moves closer to

black and white. Explosions, wars
and dictators come to the screen to
remind ofthe brutality of this cen
tury. Mark Leidy's cinematogra
phy and visual ellects deserve ap
plause for treating strong and un
settling themes in such a com
pelling and sensual way, especially
because these ellects came in a
movie coining in just over eight
minutes long.
"I Want to Blow Ip Silicon Val
lev has a great title but is a disap
pointing work of fiction. I'he
movie is interesting as a form of
protest against the development ol
the Valley in recent years and is a
knockout if you want to place
yoursell in a land ol stock options,
11' Os ,ind cellular phones. "Val
ley" is the story of Rob, a local who
has been away from home for
eight years returning to his I.(mil
iar town ol Palo Alto to find it
hostage to real estate speculation
and yuppie sexual frustration.
Rob starts dating Aby, a software
developer, after meeting on a beau
tiful hike to tlii" Foothills. Aby just

moved to Mountain View, but is al
ready being transferred somewhere
else. "Things go b\ last here," she
says. Meanwhile, Rob. with two
other locals, gets sucked into a plan
to explode compin< 1 sin companies

in the (>5O area code. Tliey attempt
to make the linns' computers ex
plode by sending a type of comput
er virus through e-mail.
Despite the had acting and let li
nical deficiencies, the movie relieds
on the story of an area that is he
coming more and more a land ol
nobody — loaded with money but
without much character. (Rob has
at least one reason to be happy: I lis
family house is been sold lor $2.7
million!) I lie movie is nostalgic ola
time when I lell's Angels on motor
cycles, not colorlully-clad execu
tives on road bikes, cruised the
winding roads ol Silicon Valley.
"Valley" also evokes the bore
dom of a community where every
thing has .1 price and may be
bought or negotiated. The writer
and director, )ason Ward, brings
up what recent progress ol the re
gion has managed to hide: the lag
ging so< i.il interaction in a commu
nity of stock-option-drivcn worka
holics. Although the movie is disap
pointing overall, it has a good
soundtrack, beautiful scenes and a
story that is tied together well. "1
want to blow up Silicon Valley" will
play Saturday at 0:15 p.m.
As the digital revolution allows
lor increasing access to video and
cinema production, we must un
derstand the importance of inde
pendent festivals like Berkeley's. In
a time ol mini-DigitalVideo cam
corders ,ind editing programs that
operate on Macintosh computers,
it becomes easier to make high
quality video projects. But it is
equally important to democratize
the access lo vino these works.
The exchange ol stories between
independent media artists and the
public is essential for the future ol
cinema as a diverse and progressive
medium. In a society led by corpo
rate media, where more and more
of the same ideas are packaged and
delivered to us, the festival shows
that independent filmmaking can
remain committed to diversity and
dialogue.
Kncounters like the Berkeley
festival, by bringing together tradi
tional works and aesthetic innova
tions ol more incipient mediums
like digital video and the Internet,
keep motion pictures alive. II the
business of art is to live in the pre
sent, then opportunities like these
allow cinema to come as close as
possible to real art.
Don't miss out; go see some
movies.
