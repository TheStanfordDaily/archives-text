# Ultra-V: 'Bringing on the Fuego'
## 'Everybody naked in the hot tub!' New York City quintet a mix of alternative rock, pop, metal, funk and a healthy dash of the playboy lifestyle 
### STEPHEN VIGIL 
"Don't you want to go down to
the playbtn mansion?" I his is the
opening verse from New York
(:it\ quintet I Itra-V, who got
their name from a drink that c on
sists of vodka, cranberry juice and
cola. "Bringing on the Fuego" is
their debut ellott on R( ret ortls
produced b\ Matt Wallace, re
sponsible lot at ts such as Faith No
More, the Replacements and
Rollins Band.
"Fuego" is a lun album l it h
with elements of alternative rot k.
pop, metal and funk. The album
exudes visions ol the high-lile,
sexuality, materialism and the ex
cesses ol capitalism. There is
plenty ol t.ilk about money, cars
and sex.
The album's opening track,

"I'lavbox Mansion," sets the tone..
It is <i t elcbration ol the American
t elebt it\ sexual culture, strikingly
similar to the film "Boogie
Nights.' During the song, lead
singer Chris Kennedy chants,

"Kverybotly naked in the hot tub .
. . " as the biting dual guitar t ills
immediate!) grab the listener's at
tention. I lie track is .1 fun groove
with ;i lunk-rock edge.
I"he next song, "Money," fol
lows iu this style. It is about a
chronic gambler in search of ma
terial happiness.

The album takes an alterna-
I ><>l > ballad twist midway through
with such tunes as "Heartful ol
Rain," "dome On" and "Can I
(-rash here Tonight?" The sound
ol these songs call to mind a cross
between Collective Soul and
YVee/.er. "Can I Crash Here
Tonight?" was written lor the hit
TV series "Roswell." It is a senti
mental ballad with a futuristic feel
created bv synthesizer effects.
Although "Can I Crash" is the
most well known of the Ultra-V
semi-ballads, the real gem is
"Come On." The song is about
being dumped by the perfect girl
and not being able to live without
her. Kennedy screams, "I want
you bad," as his desperation and
cynical hopefulness seeps
through (lie upbeat music.
The album as a whole contains
this kind of skeptical optimism

dial could Ik- ascribed to the
band's three-month recording
session in Los Angeles.
Alter the momentary lapse ol
ballads, "Bringing on the Kit ego"
goes back to its funk-rock edge
with "Lover," the best rocker on
the album, fhe song starts oil
with a montage of electronic nois
es followed by a barrage of guitar
rill's. The track is complete with
rhymes, overpowering guitars,
pulsating bass and a matching
guitar solo.
The album continues on this
note, rocking its way to an inter
esting hidden-track epilogue
where Kennedy screams in a
bluesman's voice, "I want to run
away with you," while the band
follows with a typical four-bar
blues ending.
Overall, Ultra-V's debut at
tempt is a well done, clean, fun
and decent. I lowever, the album
lacks originality and intricacy.
Ultra-V sounds like a cross be
tween a variety of '90s radio

hands like Buckcherry and Kve (>.
The lyrics are shallow, and the
solids can he repetitive. There are
lew guitar solos and rare showcas
es of musical craftsmanship. Ulti
mately, (lit- album lacks creative
substance and depth.
Although (lu- musicianship
lacks sophistication, there is one
standout: bassist Maggie Kim.
Kim's bass rills and backbeats
}>;ive the songs the backbone and
driving force they need. The rill's
are complex and intricate, mak
ing the songs sound fresh and
chic.
Admittedly, Ultra-V is solid.
There are a lot worse bands that
have record contracts. Their
music is fun to listen to and has a
genuine vibrant energy. As Chris
Kennedy says about the band,
"Our one objective on this album
was to have fun."
Ultra-V has definitely accom
plished this and, their burgeon
ing sound is something to look
forward to on future albums.
