# Complicated man doesn't deserve a simplfied box set

Sam Cooke's life was one
ol contradiction. Ihe smooth-voiced singerol such
paeans to innocent adolescent romance as "()nl\
Sixteen and"( What A) Wonderful World" was
shot dead in the nnde In the aged owner of a road
side motel following an apparent attempted rape.
(looke's music was also strangely complicated.
I le began singing in gospel groups in the pre
rock'n'roll era of the earh H). r >()s.

As the decade wore on, and (looke saw the way
rock successfully melded black and white musical
cultures, he decided to try his hand at secular
songs. I lis first successful non-religious release was
the sell-penned 1957 hit, "You Send Me." From
then until his death in Dec., I<)(>4, (looke went on
releasing pop hits that kept his name on the ( harts
as well as grittier material that laid the foundation

lot the Ciolden Age of soul
musk. Ile also became one of
the first African-American en
tertainers to aggressiveh con
trol his careei l>\ writing hisown
songs and forming his own
record label and management
conipam.

"The Man Who Invented
Soul is a lour ( 1) box set ol Sam (iooke's se( ular
songs, leaving out his earl) work with gospel
groups. It also leaves out some of his dassic latei
songs, such as "Shake" and the timeless "A (lhange
Is (ionna (loine." I hose, and some other strong
(looke creations, are in the grasp ol musk \ illain
Allen Klein's \HK( X )(oinpan\ and are. therelbre,

So what do yon get?' Hie first three C IDs contain
Cooke's pop singles and songs from related ses
sions, including a lew previously nnreleased
tracks. Main ol these times will he familiar from
the first few notes "Chain Cang," "Cupid,"
"Twistin" The Night Away" and "Another Satur
day Night" have achieved eternal lilt* through
oldies radio and nostalgic television and movie

soundtracks. ('.ooke's approach
on these songs is laid hack and
mildly swinging, taking the so
phisticated arrangements and
delivery ol adult pop singers
such as Frank Sinatra and 1 )ean
Martin and transposing them to
adolescent concerns.

I lie mid-tempo musi<
is driven In a light hackhe.it over a background ol
liveh with King Curtis's saxophone pro
viding some punch. Throughout these pop songs,
however, is some tougher, hluesier material, such
as Cooke's interpretation of "Summertime" and
Ins own superlative "Itring li On I lonic To Me."
