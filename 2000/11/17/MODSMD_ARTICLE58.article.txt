of the cast. In general, I lie- sound
and lighting were nearh perfect
throughout, though several details
stand out as especially impressive.
In one scene, Reilly traxeled along
a path from his cottage to the castle.
As he walked, the floor micro
phones recorded his progress, so I
felt like I was walking along with
him. The fairy-tale (iiant was also
ver\ well done. Kven though 1
knew there realh couldn't he a
giant in the grove, I found mvself
glancing hack over my shoulder
whenevei its voic e roared through

the loudspeaker.
My main complaint
about the show was
Sondheim's music and
writer |aines Lapine's
sc 1 ipt. While it \\ a> inter
esting to see several com
mon lairx tales com
bined in one show, the
sc 1 ipt didn't add enough
new material to stories
we've .til heard a thou
sand times. In .111 ellort
to tine 1 an ending to his
storx, I .apinc fell prey to
the W'es (Graven method
ol plot resolution, killing
characters until a solu
tion presents itself.
ihe show also ran
over three hours, mostlx
clue to ,1 litany ol silly
songs th.it didn't con
tribute to plot or charac
ter development. On

tlu* other hand,
"Agony" and, later, "Agony
(Reprise)' were the show's musical
highlights, performed with flair
and aplomb by Peter Westen (Cin
derella's Prince) and Scott Payne
(Rapun/el's Prince).
111 terms of the work done by the
stall and cast, 1 have lew negative
comments. Yoav Schlesinger was
too blatant and lecherous as the

wolf in "Hello, Little Cirl," admit
tedly a song with some inherent
undertones of sexual assault.
As fantastic as tech was, I was a
little disappointed that jack's
magic beans were pantomimed.
Would it have been that difficult to
get real beans? Finally, while I
could see all of the action just line,
some of my shorter friends didn't
have such an easy time. It would

have been nice if more scenes could
have been staged above ground
level.
Considering the fantastic stall
and cast Stahl assembled, it's no
surprise "Into the Woods" was so
professional. All the same, I was
certainl) impressed to see such a
line finished product. To the cast
and dew of "Into the Woods," a job
well done.
