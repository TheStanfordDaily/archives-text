## Dr. Didg and co. play to an aromatic atmosphere High Sierra Jamfest features 'Mahal', a postmodern fusion of attitude and lush funk 
### MICAH LAPIDUS BILL HUSTON 
( )ii a whim last Tuesday, Mill
and I popped up to Yoshi's to see
(iaraj Mahal, the first ol two shows
put oil In the High Siena Music
Festival. Contrary to our every in
tuition, we decided to check the In
ternet before committing to the
show to learn a little hit about the
ja/v band with su< ha subversiveh
"postmotlern" name.
The lineup was eclectic and in
triguing. In addition to neo- classi
cal guitarist Fareed llaque, the
band included Alan llert/. on
drums, Kai Eckharclt on bass, Dr.
Didg on didgeridoo and sample
sleuth Koto on the (let ks.
Much like last week's Irakere
show, the set began with a solo per
formance. This time, instead of a
polv-ilivlhinic afro-Cuban hand
drum solo, we had Dr. Didg (a.k.a.
I )r. (irahain Wiggins, 1 )o< torate in
l'h\ sk s, ( Klord), creating a primal
sonic environment with his
didgeridoo and live sampling rack.

The combination of Aboriginal
Australian wind instrument and
subversiveh "postmodern" elec
tronic gear yielded a dynamic
sound tb,it was both organic and
industrial.
A small but dedicated crowd
formed around the c ra/\ doctor,
event nail) filling the- entire section
of the club that had been convert
ed into a dance floor. For once, the
crowd at Yoshi's didn't appear to
be nine h cleaner 01 well-groomed
than ourselves, so we sat back and
sank into the lush funk of Dr.
I )idg.
Soon the rest of the band, minus
Kai F( khardt, took to the stage and
launched into some guitar-driven
fusion that found Fareed I laque in
front of the monitors soloing
fiercely. The groove Mowed into
nice form when Eckhardt ap
peared and set clown a smooth and
snak\ foundation 011 bass. All
night, Ec khardt, with Ins eyes star
ing supplicating!) skvwatd. looked
.is though he was channeling his
lines from some other realm.
With everyone seemingly tuned

in, the band began to move
through a diverse mix of I eels and
forms, tone liing 011 '70s style hard
fusion, Hammond-driven funk,
straight blues and even a ncw-age
vocal-"message" tune (courtesy of
Eckhardt) that contained "post
niodernlv" self-ielercntial hints of
the vocal st\lings of Bela Fleck's
"Futureman."
Haquc's bubbly personality es
tablished itself as a presence early
on, and his roaring guitar was a
consistent feature ol the nights
jams. I lie Chic ago-based guitarist
plaved both electric six-sti ing and a
12-string acoustic and, in keeping
with tlu- electro-organic theme ol
the night, sometimes broke out a
laser-driven guitai device called an
e-bow.
I laque was something of a spec
tacle all night, jumping across the
stage, rambling nonsense words
into the microphone and taking the
occasional stint on keyboards to
supplant the honest but somewhat
hackneyed Midwestern grooves of
the full-time keys player.
He even managed to forget the

name oldie of the evening s "spe
cial guests," Jetliro Jeremiah, and
at one point, interrupted a nice
ambient interlude from Roto by
saying, "This is the most lucked up
reggae song I've ever heard."
When Roto stressed the need
lor atmosphere, llaque retorted,
" They've smoked .ill the atmos
phere they need. What they need
is a groove." While the first state
ment was evident Irom the unusu
ally aromatit and laid-back leel in
side Yoshi's, I laque's insistence on
the groove does well to sum up the
musical highlights and shortcom
ings of the night.
(iaraj Mahal was comfortable
and competent with open jam
ming .md flowed smoothly in and
out ola number of styles and
through dynamic and well-sus
tained jams. I'heir ease in the
groove was evidenced In their abil
ity to incorporate multiple guest
musicians into the music with little
elfort. Will Bernard, a Hay Area
native and accomplished funk /
jazz guitarist, sat in lor a number of
1111ii's .iiul lent the evening some

enjoyable though undeveloped
playing in ihe John Scofield vein.
Local reggae-man Jethro Jere
miah also came out lor a tragically
uninspired version of Bob Marley's
"Waiting in Vain," a dragging,
two-chord performance that could
have only followed the above dia
tribe from I laque.
In spite of the shortcomings of
this particular guest appearance,
the music continued to How and
the grooves remained strong. Kck
hardt's bass continued to explode
with fresh, complicated rhythms,
and the group was able to keep a
large part of the dedicated crowd
on its feet. To be sure, the band
in its various line-ups and feels
rocked hard all night.
But what was missing from
(iaraj Mahal's sound was the musi
cal sensitivity and artistic cohesion
th.it we're used to seeing at Yoshi's.
The concert, while a nice depar
ture from more conventional
shows we've seen there, was, in the
final analysis, more of a typical
High Sierra Jamfest than it was a
jazz show.

the groove does well to sum up the
musical highlights and shortcom
ings of the night.
(iaraj Mahal was comfortable
and competent with open jam
ming .md flowed smoothly in and
out ola number of styles and
through dynamic and well-sus
tained jams. I'heir ease in the
groove was evidenced In their abil
ity to incorporate multiple guest
musicians into the music with little
elfort. Will Bernard, a Hay Area
native and accomplished funk /
jazz guitarist, sat in lor a number of
1111ii's .iiul lent the evening some

enjoyable though undeveloped
playing in ihe John Scofield vein.
Local reggae-man Jethro Jere
miah also came out lor a tragically
uninspired version of Bob Marley's
"Waiting in Vain," a dragging,
two-chord performance that could
have only followed the above dia
tribe from I laque.
In spite of the shortcomings of
this particular guest appearance,
the music continued to How and
the grooves remained strong. Kck
hardt's bass continued to explode
with fresh, complicated rhythms,
and the group was able to keep a
large part of the dedicated crowd
on its feet. To be sure, the band
in its various line-ups and feels
rocked hard all night.
But what was missing from
(iaraj Mahal's sound was the musi
cal sensitivity and artistic cohesion
th.it we're used to seeing at Yoshi's.
The concert, while a nice depar
ture from more conventional
shows we've seen there, was, in the
final analysis, more of a typical
High Sierra Jamfest than it was a
jazz show.
