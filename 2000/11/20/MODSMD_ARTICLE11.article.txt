The sky's no longer the limit for
your holiday wish list.
For the bargain price of $45,000,
you can now get your own satellite —
a eoffee-cup-sized affair that fits
neatly under any tree.
One Stop Satellite Solutions of Ogden,
Utah, which manufactures what it calls
Cube Sat mi n isatelli tes, sa id yesterday
that it had signed a deed with the Russ
ian company ISC Kosmotras to launch
the gizmos into the cosmos aboard de
commissioned Russian missiles.
The first CuheSat launch is slated
for next November.
Just as Henry Ford made the auto
mobile affordable to the masses in the
early 20th century, the Cube Sat will
make space satellites affordable to the
masses in the early 21st century, said
Dale Richards, president of One Stop.
Developed at Stanford University, the
4-inch cubes weigh about 2.2 pounds.
Typical communications satellites weigh
about 10,000 pounds and launching
one can cost millions of dollars.
