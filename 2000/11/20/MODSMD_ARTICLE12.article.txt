Fujimori issued a brief written state
ment confirming announcements made
hours earlier in Peru b\ his prime minister
and his second \ ice president.
Second Vice President Ricardo Mar
que/. said Fujimc >ri. win > has been in his an
cestral homeland Japan since Friday, had
asked him to step in as president until spe
cial elections are held in April and a new
leader takes ollice in July.
I he statement issued by Fujimori did
not explain why he was stepping down.
Prime Minister Federico Salas said the
president would give his reasons when he
presents his resignation to CCongress today
or tomorrow.
"What I know is that he does not want
to be an obstacle to the process of democ
ratization so that the next elections can be
elections absolutely transparent lor the
Peruvian people," Salas told radio station
Radioprogi amas.
Fujimori refused to meet with a crowd
ol reporters who had gathered at his
I okvo hotel. A Peruvian embassy official,
who refused i<» give his name, handed out
a brief statement in Spanish confirming
that the president would resign.
"President Alberto Fujimori confirmed
. . . ih.it he is resigning as president," the
statement said. "In the course ol 18 hours,
he is going to formalize the decision with
the newly elected president of the
(Congress."
It was not immediately clear if Fujimori
intended to go bat k to Peru to hand in his
resignation.
"We are all indignant with this attitude
of the president. I urge him to return to

the country. I le has a moral obligation to
the nation and must assume it," Marque/
said at a news conference.
Fujimori's ministers said they had de
cided to resign but would continue 011 until
it was clear who was taking over the gov
ernment. In a written statement, the min
isters expressed their "indignation" that
Fujimori's announcement was "made out
side the (ounirv in the context ola grave
c 1 isis and uncertaint\ about his return."
Peru s military high command said in a
statement that 11 would respect any
changes in the government now that Fuji
mori has resigned, as long as those
changes respec ted the < onstitution.
In Washington, White House
spokeswoman Marv Fllen Countryman
said the I nited States would work with the
()i gani/ation of American States to insure
a smooth transition.
"What's important for Peru is that the
transition to the April 8 elections proceeds
smoothh .ind peacefully And we will con
tinue to work with the ()AS on that process "
Fujimori's announcement c ame amid a
growing corruption scandal around the
president's fugitive ex-intelligence chief,
Vladiiniro Montesinos. I he scandal
forced the 62-year-old Fujimori to an
nounce in September that he would step
clown in Jul\ after new elec lions — ending
a dec ade of iron-fisted rule.
Normally under the constitution, First
Vice President Franc isco I udela would as
sume the presidency. But 1 udela present
ed his resignation hours after Montesinos
reiiii ned to Peru on ()ct. after a failed
asylum bid in Panama. I udela com
plained that Fujimori was not in control of
Montesinos and his allies.
Marque/., the second vice president,
had s.iid that he, too, would resign if
( ongress — w hit li List week came undei
opposition control lot the lirsi time since

1992 — took measures to remove Fuji
mori. But he said yesterday that Fujimori
asked him not to quit.
"I've just spoken with him and he has
said he would like me to assume the posi
tion and I told the president that ... I am
going to take the post." Marque/, told
radio station CPN.
But there were signs that a power si nig
gle may develop.
Former presidential candidate Alejan
dro Foledo — who boycotted a May
runoff against Fujimori, alleging fraud —
said in a radio interview from France that
Marque/'s association with Fujimori's "il
legitimate' government should rule him
out as a transition leader.
Peru's human rights ombudsman
Jorge Santistevan said Fudela, the first
vice president , had the right to the pc >st be
cause Congress had not yet accepted his
resignation.
"I am sure I udela is up to the c ire 11111-
stances of administering the executixe
branch until the end and guaranteeing
that Paniagua plavs the role that corre
sponds to his democratic" credentials 111
Congress," Santistevan said.
Next in line for succession after the sec -
ond vice president is the Congress presi
dent, Valentin Paniagua, a political mod
erate who was installed last week by oppo
sition legislators.
Fujimori's trip abroad prompted a
wave of rumors t hat he would step down
and seek asylum. He was—criticized for
leaving Peru to attend the Asia-Pacific Fco
nomic Cooperation forum summit in
Brunei on Wednesda\ and I hursdav.
C )n Friday, he made an unannounced
cletoui lo japan, canceling a planned trip
to Panama this weekend where Spanish
speaking and Portuguese-speaking lead
ers held an 1 hero-American summit.
At first Japanese officials had said lie

was in the country only fora layover to
change planes, then Japan's Foreign Min
isti \ said Fujimori would sta\ longer than
planned because he had a cold.
But later Saturday, the Peruvian go\
eminent announced that Fujimori
planned to remain in Tokyo until
Wednesday to negotiate loans to ease
Pet u's financial problems.
Fujimori, who lirsi came to powei in
1990. was hot n to Japanese immigrant par
ents who picked cotton in Peru until they
opened a tailor's shop in downtown 1 ima.
Ihe president has maintained strong
ties to Japan. I lis son. I liro. lives there, as
do Ins sister and brother-in-law, Vic tor Ar
itomi, Peru's ambassador to the country.

Fujimori's grip on power began to lall
apart after Montesinos, his longtime top
aide was seen apparently bribing an oppo
sition lawmaker to support the govern
ment. A videotape ol the meeting between
Montesinos and the lawinakei was leaked
to the media. Montesinos fled to Panama
but was denied asvlum and returned lo
Peru.
Since then, Fujimori has led an unsuc
cessful manhunt lor Montesinos, who is
wanted for alleged money-laundering
alter Swiss authorities froze $48 million in
accounts linked to the former spymaster.
The amount under investigation swelled
to $58 million after other accounts were
discovered, authorities said.
