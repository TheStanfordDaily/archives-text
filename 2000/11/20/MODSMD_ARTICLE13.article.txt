### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — After
seven weeks of Mideast blood
shed, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Aralat aren't on
speaking terms, but both are
speaking of restraint.
Barak said \ester"day that Israel
didn't want to escalate the conflict,
and therefore was not planning to
retaliate for the shooting death of
an Israeli soldier. Palestinian leafl
ets said the\ were working to im
plement Arafat's recent call for an
end to shooting from territory
under his control.
Two Palestinians were killed
and nine injured in three sepa
rate clashes yesterday. A 14-year
old Palestinian boy was killed
and six Palestinians injured in a
brief clash in the ( laza Strip, doc
tors said. And a 22-year-old
Palestinian was killed and two in
jured in a gun light with an Israeli
army position outside Nablus in
the northern West Bank, a doc
tor in a Nablus hospital said.
In a third incident, also in the
West Bank,about three Palestini
ans opened lire on an Israeli bus
neat the Jewish settlement of
Allei Menashe, but nobody on
the bus was hurl. Israeli soldiers
who were nearby returned fire,
but the army was not sure
whether any of the Palestinians
was hit. A Palestinian with a gun
shot wound m his abdomen was
brought shortly afterward to a
hospital at the nearby < ity of
QaUjilya, a hospital oHi< ial said.
In the Jordanian capital,
Amman, an Israeli diplomat suf
fered minor wounds in a shoot
ing attack.
But overall, violence has
ebbed. In the past few days, most
casualties have come from brief
outbursts of shooting, rather
than the large-stale, sustained
clashes that characterized much
of the conflict that has claimed
more than 2.'10 lives, most of

them Palestinian.
Previous lulls have lasted onl\
briefly, followed In renewed
spasms of unrest. Still, both sides
said vesterdav there were hopeful
signs that (aim could be restored.
Israeli army chief I t. Gen.
Shaul Mola/ said the Palestinians
have not issued a cease-lire
older,but the Palestinian leader
ship was "on the road to reduc
ing its (hostile) activities."
I lie Palestinians said vesterdav
thai lheir se< urity fort es were ail
ing on Arafat's call lor restraint, is
sued Friday. I he Palestinian lead
er ordered an end lo shooting
from Palestinian-controlled terri
tory, though he did not refer lo
land under Israeli security.
"The order means that there
will not be shooting from all the
areas that we control." Hisham
Abdel Ra/ck, the Palestinian
minister lor pi isoner affairs, told
Israel radio. Bui the "popular m
teladeh," or uprising, will contin

tie until Israel ends its occupa
tion ol Palestinian lands, lie said.
In a gnnbaitle Saturday, a
Palestinian policeman shot tlead
au Israeli soldier and wounded
two more in the Caxa Strip, be
fore being killed In return lire.
Israel lias a long history of
swill retaliation when its sol
diers 01 civilians have been at
tacked. But Barak told his Cab
inet on yesterday that Israel
would not respond militarily at
this point.
"Israel would make a mistake
if it caused an immediate escala
tion, since there is no doubt that
we would be accused ol torpedo
ing chances lor calm," Barak said
in a statement issued by his office.
Barak and Arafat have met
lace-to-face only once since the
violence erupted, a rocky session
in Paris that failed to produce a
truce. Bui in their most recent
remarks, they have refrained
from mutual criticism.
