## The
						Stanford Daily Tone down aggression, insults during Big Game 
### 
BI(. GAME IS a treasured, century
old tradition. But now the rivalry
between lid-Berkeley and Stan
lord has crossed the line. When
swat teams are required to control behavior
at a college football game, something isn't
right. Whatever happened to a friendly,
playful rivalry that everyone can enjoy?
1 he excitement and enjoyment of the
game should not be sacrificed to physically
threatening and personally harmful ac
tions from both sides. Each year, Stanford
students act in a manner that exceeds a
mere lack of sportsmanship. The rivalry
now creates an unsafe, intimidating and
threatening environment. This year's
crowd shouted such cheers as "Cal Sucks,"
"Fuck you!," "Who's your daddy?" and

"Gal's our bitch!"
It is important to note that several of these
"cheers" have misogynistic undertones that
seek to demean the other side by feminizing
them. These actions occurred both inside
and outside Memorial Stadium. Indeed,
many women felt physically threatened and
uncomfortable on Saturday as belligerent
drunks harassed them in a sexual manner
with shouts of "Show us your tits! Take off
your shirt!"
Stanford students, moreover, are guilty of
using classist, privileged statements such as
"You'll be working for us one day!" and "You
couldn't get into Stanford so you went to
Cal!" Such statements contradict the true
value of the Stanford education. Most of us
know that intelligence and worth are deeper

than the amount of money we have or our
SAT scores, but we insist we are better than
Cal students because of those very classist
and elitist ideas.
In addition, there were a number of racial
epithets slung on Big Game day. For exam
ple, some Latina students walking away from
the game yesterday reported that they were
taunted with yells of "Donde esta la bibliote
ca?" and other broken Spanish phrases from
white male Cal students.
Big Game has created a framework in
which individuals find it acceptable to
make racist, classist and sexist comments
that would elsewhere generate strong
protest. The offensive language that stu
dents use in this atmosphere would not ap
pear in their normal, everyday speech. We

need to realize that this language causes
the same harm during Big Game as it
would in the classroom, dormitory or din
ing hall.
In short, Big Game has become a forum
fora mob mentality that allows people to ha
rass other smaller groups or individuals in a
personal way and an outlet for hurling in
sults at each other. Why is this behavior an
acceptable form of rivalry? What's wrong
with just saying "Beat Cal!" and "Go Cardi
nal!" or similar competitive, but not person
al expressions?
As Stanford students, let's take the first
step toward toning down the belligerent at
mosphere surrounding Big Game in an ef
fort to re-establish respect for our beloved
tradition.
