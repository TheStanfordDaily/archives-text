# TURNING AND TURNING
## Sleep breeds originality 
### 
A friend recently told me that if he
had to end another late-night
(onversation by admitting that all
men are stupid, he'd have to
shoot himself I gathered from the rest of
out I.ilk lit,n there's a kind of repetitive,
stagnan' <|iialii\ lo these sorts of conversa
tions thai emerges after your first dozen or
so deep, probing tete-a-tetes with your
doi minales. If making conversation isat all
lik. moving through the alphabet, we've
been slut k at R lor some time now. And for
in\ friend, R meant having to profess,
night afiet night, the stupidity of men.
Being at R means we can predict, within

one or two orders of
magnitude of inanity,
what a deep late-night
((mversation is like. Stop
me if am of this sounds
grossh unfamiliar. You
don't remember actual-
Is starling the < onversa
ti«hi. You were probably
walking down the ball

i<>, sa\. the bathroom, when you had to step
over two people talking in the hallway.
\t some point, you joined them, one of
the people somehow disappeared, and the
other two of you wound up talking until
the sun < arne up, all the while noting how
neat it was that vou were really having
"one of these conversations." And then the
earl) risers on your floor wake up, find
vou talking in the hallwav, join in, and you
make your exit.
Two observations.
First of .ill, yon didn't start the conver
sation. You |i ist helped propagate one of
live eonvei sations that have been circulat
ing around this campus since 1891.
I he\ ve been coevolving in Darwinian
fashion and have managed to modify
themselves for our times.
Nobod\ really knows how these discus
sions a< tn.ilh started, but modern science
allows us to make pretty accurate guesses
it t lien topic s of origin. One of them had
to do with Plato's "Allegory of the Cave,"
fan these davs is about postmodernism.
1 lowevei. its Platonie roots tend to surface
even time a sleep-deprived frosh pro
< laims that we're all stuck in the cave.
And then there's the argument about
Mat sism. And the discourse on the yearn
ing for love. I hese conversations have
made you mistake expectation for depth,
because everyone told you that you'd be
having these eat l\-morning talks about
life, love and ideas in college. Right?
Second, you aren't saying anything
original. I here are certain formulas that
we tend to follow. For example, if two men
and a woman are talking, one man will es
pouse ridiculously "masculine" ideals,

while the other will take on correspond
ingly extreme "feminine" opinions.
If two men are speaking alone, at least
one will admit to some sort of overwhelm
ing insecurity that "nobody could possibly
understand." If a man is talking to a
woman, one will end up having to apolo
gize for the stupidity of his or her gender.
Furthermore, if they should make the
mistake of talking about love, they will ex
perience the emotional equivalent of
hooking up and will accordingly never
talk about it again, and may even disown
the entire dialogue.
These revelations should either be ex
tremely liberating or exceedingly depress
ing. Could it be possible that we have noth
ing new to say to each other, that progress
through communication is an illusion?
There's something about watching the
sun rise with someone that makes you want
to ignore them for the rest of the dav, week,
or month. It's a conquistador mentality —
keep the other person up until dawn, es
pecially when they've been complaining all
along about having work due the next day,
and you've somehow conquered them.
After that, you've won! There's nothing
left for them to give you, so it's time to
move on to the next person. Lather, rinse,
repeat. And when you've finally exhaust
ed all of the people around you, it's time to
go looking for "interesting people" who
will surely have something "deep" to tell
you, as if depth is something that can be
easily recognized and measured.
It might be even less permissible when
you're having the same conversation with
one person, over and over again. It
doesn't even need to be at night; it can
happen at the post office, CoHo, or in the
beginning-of-the-quarter line at the Book
store. Why waste each other's time with
the same small talk you've been making
since freshman year, when both of you
know you have nothing else to say?
Between "depth" and the black hole of
small talk lies our problem of conversa
tion. In our rush to be "ourselves," we
propagate a silly system of enforced inti
macy in which we talk and talk and talk
and say nothing that we don't expect to
hear in the first place.
There's a simple solution, of course.
Abstain from making "deep conversation"
and you won't subject others to the same
old thing, night after night. It might give
them some peace and quiet, a chance to
get some work done and time to think of
something new to say.

move on to the next person. Lather, rinse,
repeat. And when you've finally exhaust
ed all of the people around you, it's time to
go looking for "interesting people" who
will surely have something "deep" to tell
you, as if depth is something that can be
easily recognized and measured.
It might be even less permissible when
you're having the same conversation with
one person, over and over again. It
doesn't even need to be at night; it can
happen at the post office, CoHo, or in the
beginning-of-the-quarter line at the Book
store. Why waste each other's time with
the same small talk you've been making
since freshman year, when both of you
know you have nothing else to say?
Between "depth" and the black hole of
small talk lies our problem of conversa
tion. In our rush to be "ourselves," we
propagate a silly system of enforced inti
macy in which we talk and talk and talk
and say nothing that we don't expect to
hear in the first place.
There's a simple solution, of course.
Abstain from making "deep conversation"
and you won't subject others to the same
old thing, night after night. It might give
them some peace and quiet, a chance to
get some work done and time to think of
something new to say.
