Fitness Center decline due to
ignored warnings
I own and operate the company that
for nearly the last three years has main
tained the exercise equipment at the Stan
lord Tresidder Fitness Center. Though
one might think I would take offense at
the scathing description of Tresidder Fit
ness offered in the opinions section of this
publication, ("Non-varsity athletics," Nov.
15), I'm actually thankful to finally have a
forum in which to describe my battle and
frustration of the last 36 months.
We began maintenance on the equip
ment shortly after it was installed and soon
saw a problem: The amount of use this fa
cility receives is astronomical â€” nearly
twice the use of a typical commercial gym.
So, we recommended an increased main
tenance program.
On March 18 1998, I wrote a letter to
the powers-that-be, expressing that "it is
my firm belief that Tresidder requires this
stepped-up maintenance if the gym is not
to suffer from excessive equipment fail
ures and down time." Fred Stephens, who
from day one has made every attempt to
get this facility the maintenance it re
quires, forwarded the letter.
There was no response.
Over the course of the next year, we
watched the equipment steadily decline.
Though we perform maintenance once a

month, and Fred lias his stall doing what
they can, it is far less than the gym requires.
Complaints soon became rampant, and
Fred made many efforts to obtain permis
sion to increase the maintenance program.
He was ignored.
On May 18, 1999, 1 wrote a second let
ter, again expressing the need for
stepped-up maintenance. 1 offered sever
al solutions, including the creation of a
part-time student position for regular pre
ventative maintenance. 1 even offered to
provide the training.
No response.
I contacted the equipment distributor,
Tom Grace of Grace Premier Fitness, and
had him call the University and explain
the need for more maintenance.
Nothing.
Finally, with the help one of the main
tenance heads, we met and came up with
a plan to create a full-time University gym
maintenance position. I offered to assist in
the hiring and training of this individual.
Our contact presented the proposal, mak
ing it known that if the steppers didn't
start to receive some serious full-time at
tention, they would soon become unser
viceable and need to be replaced.
We weren't ignored this time, rather
the powers-that-be kicked around the idea
of "giving" the job to some dangerously
unqualified individual and then just sort
of forgot about the whole thing. Fred and

I tried to explain that maintaining high
tech machinery is not a job for someone
with little or no mechanical expertise.
You guessed it .. .we were ignored.
Which brings us to the Tresidder Fit
ness Center of today: Three years is an aw
fully short life span fora $2,500 stepper,
but that's what you've got. Actually you've
got ten of them, all with tens of millions of
steps on the clock and all them creaking,
filthy, rusting wrecks, sitting on two giant
ever-expanding sweat stains. They break
as fast as they are fixed and will continue to
do so until they are simply no longer cost
effective to repair. That will be any day
now, and the rest of the cardio equipment
is not far behind.
Caught 111 the middle of all this is Fred
Stephens. As manager of the facility he has
done everything in his power, trying re
peatedly to get someone to listen to him.
He has endured the grief of constant com
plaints about a situation for which he is
being held responsible, yet is given no re
course to correct. I share this feeling. I'm
actually embarrassed to admit my compa
ny services the Tresidder Gym.
I he really sad thing: This didn't have
to happen. If warnings that were made
nearly three years ago had been heeded,
the students would still ha' e decent equip
ment. Instead, you have a gym that re
sembles, well, what was described in this
paper on Thursday, Nov. 16.
