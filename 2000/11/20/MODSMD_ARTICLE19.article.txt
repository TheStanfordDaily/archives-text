Fitness Center decline due to
ignored warnings
I own and operate the company that
for nearly the last three years has main
tained the exercise equipment at the Stan
lord Tresidder Fitness Center. Though
one might think I would take offense at
the scathing description of Tresidder Fit
ness offered in the opinions section of this
publication, ("Non-varsity athletics," Nov.
15), I'm actually thankful to finally have a
forum in which to describe my battle and
frustration of the last 36 months.
We began maintenance on the equip
ment shortly after it was installed and soon
saw a problem: The amount of use this fa
cility receives is astronomical — nearly
twice the use of a typical commercial gym.
So, we recommended an increased main
tenance program.
On March 18 1998, I wrote a letter to
the powers-that-be, expressing that "it is
my firm belief that Tresidder requires this
stepped-up maintenance if the gym is not
to suffer from excessive equipment fail
ures and down time." Fred Stephens, who
from day one has made every attempt to
get this facility the maintenance it re
quires, forwarded the letter.
There was no response.
Over the course of the next year, we
watched the equipment steadily decline.
Though we perform maintenance once a

month, and Fred lias his stall doing what
they can, it is far less than the gym requires.
Complaints soon became rampant, and
Fred made many efforts to obtain permis
sion to increase the maintenance program.
He was ignored.
On May 18, 1999, 1 wrote a second let
ter, again expressing the need for
stepped-up maintenance. 1 offered sever
al solutions, including the creation of a
part-time student position for regular pre
ventative maintenance. 1 even offered to
provide the training.
No response.
I contacted the equipment distributor,
Tom Grace of Grace Premier Fitness, and
had him call the University and explain
the need for more maintenance.
Nothing.
Finally, with the help one of the main
tenance heads, we met and came up with
a plan to create a full-time University gym
maintenance position. I offered to assist in
the hiring and training of this individual.
Our contact presented the proposal, mak
ing it known that if the steppers didn't
start to receive some serious full-time at
tention, they would soon become unser
viceable and need to be replaced.
We weren't ignored this time, rather
the powers-that-be kicked around the idea
of "giving" the job to some dangerously
unqualified individual and then just sort
of forgot about the whole thing. Fred and

I tried to explain that maintaining high
tech machinery is not a job for someone
with little or no mechanical expertise.
You guessed it .. .we were ignored.
Which brings us to the Tresidder Fit
ness Center of today: Three years is an aw
fully short life span fora $2,500 stepper,
but that's what you've got. Actually you've
got ten of them, all with tens of millions of
steps on the clock and all them creaking,
filthy, rusting wrecks, sitting on two giant
ever-expanding sweat stains. They break
as fast as they are fixed and will continue to
do so until they are simply no longer cost
effective to repair. That will be any day
now, and the rest of the cardio equipment
is not far behind.
Caught 111 the middle of all this is Fred
Stephens. As manager of the facility he has
done everything in his power, trying re
peatedly to get someone to listen to him.
He has endured the grief of constant com
plaints about a situation for which he is
being held responsible, yet is given no re
course to correct. I share this feeling. I'm
actually embarrassed to admit my compa
ny services the Tresidder Gym.
I he really sad thing: This didn't have
to happen. If warnings that were made
nearly three years ago had been heeded,
the students would still ha' e decent equip
ment. Instead, you have a gym that re
sembles, well, what was described in this
paper on Thursday, Nov. 16.
l ltimately, I'm ama/ed at the short
sightedness ol it all. I o save a lew hundred
dollars on maintenance in the beginning,
the powers-that-be have thrown awa\ lens
ol thousands in equipment thai will pre
maturely bit the scrap heap.
It makes no sense to me. But I'm just a
mechanic.

More misinformation in the
abortion debate
This letter is a response to Dave Kale's
letter about "abortion services" needing
attention ("Abortion services need atten
tion," Nov. 17).
As a lormer intern at Planned Parent
hood, I can saleh sav that such women's
health clinics — not "abortion c linic s" as

those who are anti-choice call them —
work lo promote responsible choices in
family planning.
They work to make sure that all chil
dren are wanted and healthy. They pro
vide non-directive counseling ili.it covers
all options lor unintended pregnancies
and strive to make sure that their clients
understand the pros and cons of each op
tion. They provide responsible sex educa
tion. I hey aim to reduce unintended
pregnancies and abortions, but also to
keep abortion legal and sale lor those who
need it. Planned Parenthood <>l Pasadena
spends less than live percent of its operat
ing budget 011 abortions and over ( .)f> per
cent on education, medical services and
counseling.
I he majority of women's health clinics
are responsible in the same way as
Planned Parenthood. Kale alleges that it is
"presumptuous and idealistic" to state that
all clinics keep records. It is equally inac
curate. however, to insinuate that the inci
dence of this happening is disproportion
ally great in women's health clinics.
Of course, there are exceptions to ev
erything! However, the number of irre
sponsible clinics, especially those who

would provide abortions lor women if
they "did not fully understand it," is much
smaller than anti-choice people would
have us believe. I he frequency of women
who terminated their pregnancies with
out education, counseling or the tare of
responsible health professionals was actu
ally much greater before abortion was
legal.
I would like to return some food for
thought for Kale. Here is a scenario: A
poor woman in a developing country, by
viture of the fact that she is a woman, is
mandated to obey by state laws of wifely
"obedience." She can't leave, seeing as
how her country also has laws that permit
only men to end the marriage union and
that restrict her tight to travel, study or
work without permission from a male
"guardian."
(lombined with these cultural expecta
tions is the lack of contraception or family
planning education available in her coun
try. Is she obliged to have children just be
cause she is a woman and she can? What il
she doesn't want to?
II you think this sounds far-fetched,
consider that Nigeria permits husbands to
"correct" their wives with physical punish

ment. Costa Rica and other countries
allow rapists to escape prosecution if the\
marry their vie inns. Saudi Arabian women
still can't drive and women in Kuwait still
can't vote. Being a United States citi/en
might put me out of the teach of these
laws, but such regulations are the result of
keeping women from making their own
decisions.
I might one day encounter the
prospect of being pregnant, a situation in
which Kale will never find himself. Il is not
just my body ;it issue, but the notion that
nobody should deprive me of the right to
make my own c hoices. Let me make up
mv mind, because I'd rather not face the
consequences of a state that didn't trust
me to make dec isions.
