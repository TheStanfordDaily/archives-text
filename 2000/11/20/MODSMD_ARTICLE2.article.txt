# Cardinal wins one Moore Big Game
## 
### MATT LONG STAFF WRITER 
Starting the third century of the Big
Game, it was tkting to add a new twist
to the series's wacky and storied history.
Pjßut unlike the infamous Play of 1982,
there were no trombone players missing a
shoestring tackle, and there was no Cal victo
ry. Saturday in Berkeley, it was just a single,
simple, indelible pass to the fullback that gave
Stanford a thrilling 36-30 overtime victory.
With the game and Bay Area respect on the
lint?, Stanford dug into the tuner sanctum qsgjs
playbook and uncovered a device not usep
since last season. On second down in the first
period of overtime, junior quarterback Randy
Fasani faked a handoff to junior fullback Casey
Moore and then dropped back to pass. Moore
charged through the line, and found himself
uncovered by the Cal secondary. Fasani
promptly threw him the ball in stride as Moore
waltzed untouched into the end zone.
"I didn't quite think that I'd be that wide
open," Moore said. "Usually I expect a line
backer to step up and I shed him. 1 felt, like [the
ball] was sitting up there fora minute, 1 just
looked it into my hands."

Junior nose tackle Trey Freeman (93) and senior placekicker Mike Biselli celebrate with members of the Axe Committee. The Cardinal retained the historic trophy with a victory in the first-ever overtime in the 103-game series.
"We've been preparing all this
\ear for the right place and the
light time to run this play," said
Stanford coach Ivrone Willing

um, shut the doors and work on
something like that."
Willingham has a knack for
beating the Hears, standing9-oall
time against C !al, with six of those
victories coming as the Stanford
head coach. I his sixth-straight
Big Came win ties the record for
consecutive wins in the contest,
the othei streak coming from
(lardinal squads in the 19f>0s.
Once again, Cal played Stan

mances In both teams through
out the first three quarters ol
plav, Stanford led 10-13 despite
compiling only 99 yards in total
offense. Neither team lias

ers fought to a 30-30 draw in the
end ol regulation.

elected to plav defense in the first
overtime series.
"Its alwa\ s better to know what
you have to do," explained Will

He missed wide left and the
Cardinal lined up at the 25. On

Moore up the middle who was
slopped lor no gain b\ (lal's pow
erlul defensive front. The call
brought up moans from the ('.ar
dinal faithful, as Stanford had
onl\ run for 48 vards in 40 tries in
the game. I he complaints soon
turned to a victory roar when
fasani threw a play-action strike
to the streaking fullback.
After ( al scored on its opening
possession behind the arm ol
sophomore quarterback Kyle
Boiler, Stanford struggled to find
its offensive rhythm.
But the special teams picked
up the slack when senior Colin
Branch blocked a Nick Harris
punt with 3:40 left in the quarter.
Branch managed to scoop up the

bouncing football and run 20
Yards to bring the score to 7-f>
alter Stanford missed tlit- extra
point.
"That was a different rush
than we've had in the past,"
Branch said. "I came in real wide
and noboch blocked me so I came
in untouched."
Stanford again found an open
ing to block a Hat l is punt with
7:()S in the first hall when redshirt
freshman Brian (laffnev blot ked
a kirk straight into the air. Senior
Riall Johnson corralled the ball at
