# Cardinal wins one Moore Big Game
## 
### MATT LONG STAFF WRITER 
Starting the third century of the Big
Game, it was tkting to add a new twist
to the series's wacky and storied history.
Pj√üut unlike the infamous Play of 1982,
there were no trombone players missing a
shoestring tackle, and there was no Cal victo
ry. Saturday in Berkeley, it was just a single,
simple, indelible pass to the fullback that gave
Stanford a thrilling 36-30 overtime victory.
With the game and Bay Area respect on the
lint?, Stanford dug into the tuner sanctum qsgjs
playbook and uncovered a device not usep
since last season. On second down in the first
period of overtime, junior quarterback Randy
Fasani faked a handoff to junior fullback Casey
Moore and then dropped back to pass. Moore
charged through the line, and found himself
uncovered by the Cal secondary. Fasani
promptly threw him the ball in stride as Moore
waltzed untouched into the end zone.
"I didn't quite think that I'd be that wide
open," Moore said. "Usually I expect a line
backer to step up and I shed him. 1 felt, like [the
ball] was sitting up there fora minute, 1 just
looked it into my hands."
