# Scholars analzye, discuss presidential election debacle
## Experts speak about implications and possible outcome 
### ALAN DAGOVITZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
From the act usations living be
tween ihe 1 )emocratic and Repub
lic .in camps to the \ iewpoint ol the
guv down the hall, students have
heard enough election explana
tions, denunciations, opinions and
predictions to keep their heads
buzzing until 2004 rolls around.
lint here are three more edu
cated perspectives from I niversity
s< holars whose knowledge of poli
tics is based on more than Dan
Rather quotes and New York
limes' editorials.
History and American Studies
I'rof. Jack I'akove, Political Science
Prof. Simon J.u km,in and political
s( iencedoctoral student Sean I he
riault, who is ( in t ently teaching a
(ourse on congressional and pres
idential elections, answered a se
ries ol questions concerning the
< in rent presidential election prob
lems.
()ne ol the mote obvious ques
tions is the possibility of a revote in
Florida or in Palm Beach County.
\ll three scholars felt that both ol
these options are so unlikely they
are neat l\ impossible.
Ii strikes me .is an extremely
heavy-handed legal remedy to the
problem ol 'voter confusion, "
| a< kman said.
Rakove cited the constitutional
authorit\ ol the voting date set bv
Congress and I heriault named
the integrit\ ol the voting process
as reasons that would preclude a
revote.
II no revote is to occur, then
dealing with the c ut rent recount
seems to be the most likelv solu

tion.
But what if Florida is not able to
c ertify its votes before the Flee tot al
College meets? Will their votes be
disregarded? 1 his question drew
more diverse responses.
I heriault lelt that it would be in
Florida's best interest to declare its
winner of the 2f> electoral votes In
Dec. IS. For the same reason. Jack
man said lie was confident tli.it
Florida would decide bv the dead
line, still more than a month away.
Rakove commented that the slate
legislature (controlled by Republi
cans) could still appoint electors if
the popular vote were tied up.
Fac li scholar .ilso commented
on what should happen from a
legal and moral perspective.
"Legally I think there's no ques
tion that the suits will have to plav
out; both parties, as well as citi
zens . . . have too strong a stake in
the outcome," Rakove said.
"Morally, it seems to me that there
is no question that Core gained a
plurality of all the votes cast in
Florida . . . but the delects in the
ballot m Palm Beach deprived him
of that margin."
I heriault stated that he lelt
Vice President A1 (iore proposed a
reasonable deal when he asked
I exas (iov. (ieorge W. Bush to ac -
cede to the results of a recount.
"II Coventor Hush agreed to
this deal, it would bring a definitive
end to the process . . . an end that
wouldn't be determined in the
courtroom," I heriault said.
Faking a more legalistic ap
proach, Jackman lelt that the law
should play itsell out and in doing
so, vindicate the practice ol
democracy.
As for changes that will result
from this election, both Rakove
and |ackman c ited ballot reform,
in the lbrm of a national ballot,
electronic voting or, if nothing
else, .in increase in attention to bal
lot design. I heriault said that c iti

/ens might see the adoption of the
Maine and Nebraska voting sys
tem in more slates.
In those states, the candidate
with the most voles statewide gets
the two senator electoral votes and
the candidate with the most voles
within each congressional district
gets the house member's electoral
vote," he explained.
"Another possible change is
mandating that the electors vote
lor the candidate that the) repre
sent so that the term 'unfaithful
elec tor'is again onl\ know nln his
torians and political scientists," he
added.
I hough the ellects of ibis elec -
tion are lelt most strongly in the
I nitcd Slates, the scholars also
commented on the international
community's reaction lo the elec
tion.
Jackman and 1 heriault both
leel that the legal process, however
frustrating, is necessary to pre
serve the integrity ol America's
democracy.
"In ,i very real way, this could
well be one ol American democra
cy's finest moments." |ackman
said "A billei < <>ntcsl, l<night hard,
bin peacefully, calmly, in accor
dance' with well-defined principles
of law. No guns. No violence."
Rakovc was a little more skepti
cal about the state of America's in
ternational dignity, but added,
"Americans ncvci c are very much
what foreigners think about us;
since we know we're the best, even
when lliecN iclene e is contrary, win
worry?"
All three scholars said tliev have
learned lessons tli.it the rest of the
countrx has most likel\ learned as
well. Ilislon is lull ol surprises,
and even vole counts, which
means that scemingh inconse
quential minutiae like bulterfh
ballots, c had and rules for count
ing absentee ballots are more im
portant than one might think.
