Allordable fac ult\ housing has long been a prob
lem, l)iii Provost |ohn Ktcliemcnelv s recent an
nouncement of a much-improved housing pro
gram looks to lix this issue.
I he revamped program was designed to retain
old lac nil\ and recruit new oncsln providing lanil
ly with more opportunities to take out l<><tiis and a
better way of paying them oil. I lie program will
cost the 1 niversitN around $l.'i million in the fust
vear and gradually increase to $10 million.i vear
over the next 15 years.
"Availability ol allordable housing has become
one of our biggest recruiting challenges," said I ni
versitN President |ohn Ili'iinessv. I his program
will improve the ability ol our la< ult\ to pure base
homes in an area where home prices arc signifi
cantly higher than almost anvwhere in the coun
try."
With the new program, lacult\ are now eligible
lor programs to help them purchase homes at a
higher value than the\ could under the old pro
gram.
According to minutes from the Nov. 9 I a< iill\
Senate meeting, an assistant professoi who is earn
ing $(i2,928 will now be able to allord propel i\
worth as much as $724,000, as opposed io$") 12,")00
with the old programs.
Associate prolessors, who earn $K">,077, arc now
able to shop Ibi homes that reach the $9.'i5.000
mark, where belore the\ were limited to the
$077,000 range. I lie new programs also benefit full
prolessors. who earn $121,095, In raising theii
"target" property price from $9 I I,."> 000 to
$1,200,000.
(larolvn Sargent, director ol lacultN and stall
housing, said one ol the new components ol the
plan, called the I )elerred Interesi Program, will aid
faculty who have not pure based homes sine e their
appointment.
(ioing into cllect lor housing purchases alici
Jan. 1. I lie- program is a nonainoi ti/.ing loan. I he
loan does not allow gradual payment ol the debt)
with zero percent current interest. At the timeol re
payment, the borrowei owes the original |>i inc ipal
plus Stanford's pro rata share ol appreciation.
II there is no appreciation, the borrowei owes
onl) iheorigin.il, unpaid principal. Phis program
allows fora loan up to 20 percent ol the pure base

price, ola maximum loan <>l $17.5,000, Sargent
said. Am deterred interest is due when the borrow
er sells or moves out ol the home, refinances the
program or becomes ineligible.
The borrower can then utilize two other pro
grams to c<>ver the rest <>1 the finances.
Facult\ seem pleased with these plans. Linguis
tics I'rol John Ritklord and Judith Swain, chair of
the Department ol Medicine, both part ol the l*ac
iilt\ Senate Steering C lommittee, also noted the im
portance of the plan iu keeping up with the compe
tition for new ta< 11It\ with oilier schools around the
nation.
"Attracting and retaining top-notch faculty is
critical to the abilil\ of 'Stanford to continue its rep
utation as a world leader in university research and
teat lung, Ricklbrtl said.
"l acullx housing is generalh more accessible
and allordable in the neighborhoods around the
first-rale universities with which wellunpete for fac
uli\, like I larvartl and IT-lierkeley, but the ex
iremeh innovative housing financing programs an
nounced l>\ the provtjst will allow us to compete
with them effectively, to the benefit of everyone at
Stanford."
Swain atltletl that "obtaining; uletjuate housing is
.i challenge for our students, la< ult\ and staff. The
new housing program is anothci important step in
assuring that we can recruit and retain the highest
<|iialit\ lacult\ lor t>ur institution."
Another program that will help faculty obtain
loans more easilv, acrording to Sargent, is I lie !â€¢ ixetl
Rate Amortizing Mortgage.
I his is a full) amortizing loan offered at a low
inai kel interest rate is lixed lor the duration of the
loan term. I lie maximum loan amount is up to 60
pert cut ol the pin t base prit e or fair market value,
whichever is less, to a maximum loan value ol
$750,000.
I his option lakes advantage of the I 'diversity's
abilit\ to borrow monev at a rate lower than an in
dividual can. Ihe I niversitx passes these savings
to faculty. I Ins plan is an improvement from the
old housing assistance plan because ii enables fac
ult \ tt> gain more t'tjuiix with the Fixed Rate Amor
tizing Mortgage. I lowever. lilt ult\ mav utilize both
plans.
