While Stanford already boasts an impressive num
ber ol award-winning and renowned fat uity, the of
fice of die dean of research presented staff member
Charles ()rgish with a $3,000 award for contributions
to the University on Friday.
( haiies ()rgish, technical manager for the Ele< tri
cal Engineering Labs and manager of distributed svs
tems in the Computer Systems Laboratory won I lie
lOth-annual Marshall I). O'Neill Award.
I lie award is given annually in recognition of stall
contributions to University research.
"I was surprised and honored, but being singled
out is kind of strange," Orgish said. "I'm not very
good with crowds."
Since coming to Stanford inl9Ns, Orgish has
worked extensively in the design and installation of
network infrastructure for the Cates Computer Sci
ence Building, the Allen Center lor Integrated Sys
tems and the Packard Electrical Engineering build
ing. I Ie also provides around-the-clock technical sup
port for faculty, stall and students in the Electrical En
gineering and (Computer Science departments.
"We have a very diverse [computing] environment
here, and [he] keeps it running. If something goes
wrong, Charlie's usually the first one there," said
Electrical Engineering Prof. Bruce Wooley.
()rgish's dedication is rivaled only by his tec hnical
expertise.
"1 was out of the country and the main server [in
Gates] failed. Compaq couldn't fix it. I was in contact
with [him] day and night, and he brought the ma
chines back up within 24 hours," said Electrical Engi
neering Prof. Ciovanni de-Micheli.
"Especially here in Silicon Valley, there are a lot of
people who can do networking, but not many who
can do it in an environment as challenging as (Char
lie's. It's non-standard in every way," said Asst. Dean
of Research Ann George.
Beyond daily maintenance of networking and
computer systems, ()rgish has brought in "something

on the order of a million dollars" worth of donations
from Cisco, according to W'ooley. "He knew pe0p1e....!
ple....! le had friends and colleagues there."
Orgish also played a role in the development of
Yahoo! and Coogle Web sites, having worked with
the founders when the\ were students at Stanford.
()rgish views Ins work as part of a group effort.
"I like to be working in a cooperative manner
where pretty much everyone helps each other.
I here should he cooperation and collaboration in
the OS and Kf Departments. It's basically about
shared resources," he said.
I hough he hasolien been recruited In outside start
ups and other companies, Orgish has turned down
every potentially lucrative offer to remain at Stanford.
"I do have a sense of responsibility for the people I
work for. It's always been difficult for me to move
jobs," Orgish explained. " There was onl\ one time
[working lot an outside company J became something
I thought seriously about, because they also did
things in marine biology which I have a very strong
interest in. Don't gel me started on the climb of the
amphibian population."
Marine biology isn't ()rgish'sonl\ outside interest.
"1 actually did lots of mental health and public
health work. I was on the Venereal Disease Advisory
Council for the state for many years," he said.
According to Orgish, who studied chemistry and
psychology at San Jose Stale University, the clinical
work he did in college allowed him abundant free
time in the summer.
It was during one such summer that he began
helping a friend with prototype building, which even
tually led to 12 years of work at Xerox (.01 potation's
Palo Alto Research ('.enter and then to his current po
sition at Stanford. His colleagues are glad became.
"Charlie is the epitome of someone who leads by
example. 1 le lias dedication to Stanford and a sense
of community to an extraordinary degree, and that's
coupled with incredible technical expertise," Wooley
said. "We all feel so fortunate to have liini here — he's
truly a special individual."
