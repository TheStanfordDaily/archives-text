# Women's basketball outsized, outplayed

### DANA MULHAUSER EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford women's basket
ball team traveled to Moraga
Calif., to play St. Mary's Friday
night. Once they arrived, they
t raveled even more.
A sloppy Cardinal team fum
bled on both offense and defense,
including seven traveling viola
tions in the lirst half, in a 74-C»*i sea
son-opening loss to the (laels.
No. 12 Stanford looked lost
without point guard Jamie Carey,
who stopped playing this fall be
cause of recurring concussions.
Carey, last season's Pacific 10 Con
ference Freshman of the Year,
gave Stanford an outside threat as
well as an experienced leader at
the point, both of which it sorely
missed Friday,
"If you took anyone of Jamie's
caliber off the team, you're going
to notice that," said head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "She adds poise
and talent to our team."
Carey sat on the bench in street
clothes, leaving freshman Susan
King to run the show. King had 10
points and four assists, but she and
the rest of the Cardinal offense
were rattled by the swarming Gael
defense.
Stanford's small lineup was out
muscled by St. Mary's on both
ends of the court, especially by the
frontcourt tandem ol Jermisha
and Jerkisha Dosty. Both Jer
misha, 6-foot-3, and Jerkisha, 0-2,
notched double-doubles. Stanlbrd
played much of the game without

a (rue center, and the Dosty twins
took advantage, grabbing 2<S re
bounds.
"We got board alter board after
board, and that kept fueling out
lire," said St. Mary's head coach
Michelle Jacoby, who won her first
ever game as a head coach.
Stanford's sole offensive spark
came from junior forward
Bethany Donaphin, who scored 1 f>
points in the second half to keep
Stanford alive. But Donaphin
alone was not enough to overcome
Jermisha and Jerkisha Dosty.
"Bethany, she needs another
bookend," said VanDerveer. "We
need a much better contribution
from our post players. I hey were
scrambling and playing catch-up
all the time."
The Cardinal got behind early,
I.H-2, in a stretch that included a
Ibur-minute scoring drought. The
stretch of futility was a democratic
effort, with live different Stanford
players clanging shots off"the rim.
Ihe Cardinal cut the lead to
seven points by halftime, but a
jump shot from Jerkisha Dosty
brought the Cael lead to an insur
mountable 21 points with 13 min
utes left in the half.
Freshman Nicole Powell, who
was coming off" a triple-double in
Stanford's exhibition win over
R'l lJ Clondica of Latvia, scored
only 5 points. Powell started but
played only 22 minutes as juniors
Lauren St. Clair and Lindsey Ya
masaki saw extended time on the
lloor.

met. including a 77-C>."> win last sea

coming team who made their first
NCAA tournament in 1999 and

top team," said Jacoby.
