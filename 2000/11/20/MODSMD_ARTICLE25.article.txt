# McDonald comes up big early for Stanford
## 
### SAMEER AHMED EDITORIAL STAFF 
The winner was never in donhi in last
night's men's basketball game against San
Francisco State. The only quest ion was how
the Cardinal was going to put the Gators
away.
Would the Collins brothers pound the
Cators and their 0-7 center oil the court?
Would sophomore guard Casey Jacobsen, an
All-American candidate, go on a shooting
spree? Would sophomore center Curtis lior
chardt step up big again?
While everyone had his moments in Stan
lord's 100-49 win, the player who shined the
brightest yesterday night was perhaps Stan
ford's least-known star, senior point guard
Michael McDonald.
After draining four early three-pointers,
McDonald had already tied his career-high in
points in the first live minutes of the game.
Two minutes later, Mc Donald hit anothei

three to put the Cardinal up by 20 points.
"I'm normally not looking to shoot every
time down court," McDonald said. "Hut
Casey was penetrating, and leaving me open.
The shots just came to me tonight."
With two easy layups early in the second
half, McDonald showed the Stanford faithful
that he can drive too.
Nineteen points in 19 minutes? Not too
shabby fora guy whose best qualities, to use
the cliche, don't show up on the stat sheet.
Maybe McDonald learned something from
Kenneth Wu of Cupertino, who hit live three
pointers in .SO seconds in a promotional con
test during a timeout.
Or, maybe not.
"1 worked on [my jump shot] a lot during
the summer time and preseason," McDonald
said. "1 think for our team to be successful,
I've got to take some outside shots."
McDonald has been a different type of
point guard than his Pacific 10 Conference
counterparts, Jason Gardner of Arizona and

Karl Watson ol UCLA, or Stanford predeces
sors Brevin Knight and Art Kee. In the past,
McDonald hasn't looked to score. Instead, his
main role has been to select the potential scor
er from a very impressive cast.
"We've been alter (McDonald] to hit the
open shot and not be afraid of it." Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery said. "We tell him to
shoot those. For iis it's a major plus to have all
live positions that can score.'
McDonald's offensive performance might
be the key lor this team that already has four
other potent offensive targets 111 the starting
lineup: Jacobsen, the ('.animal's leading scor
er last year; the Collins brothers, who have
been unstoppable clown low; and senior for
ward Ryan Mende/, another three-point
threat.
This season, McDonald, who also went
four-lor-four from three-point range last
week in an exhibition game against Clobal
Sports, could add the extra scoring effort to
put the Cardinal in another Final Four.
