In t lie words of Stanford men's
basketball roach Mike Mont
gomery, San Francisco State was
"gracious" in agreeing to play his
squad in its home opener, after an
arrangement fora different open

You ma) count Stanford,
then, as a fairly ungracious host,
fora bin/ ol three-point shots and
easy layups that sent the Division
II (iators back to the C!ii\ with a
100-49 defeat on their shoulders.
I lie win matched the third-high
est margin of victory in Stanford
history.
"To be honest with you, I
thought their attitude toward this
game was very good." Mont
gomery said. "They came, the)

that's a mystery."
Nice understatement, coach.
