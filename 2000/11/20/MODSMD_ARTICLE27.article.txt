# Lucky 6 brings the Cardinal victory
## 
### AARON LEVINE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Cardinal fans, celebrate.
Pass the security guards and
their video cameras in Memorial
Stadium with pride, smirk at the
obnoxious Weenies along Cal's
Fraternity Row with silent egoism
and celebrate.
And while you're celebrating
yet another Stanford Big Game
victory, take time to celebrate the
number six.
Sine, it might be numerology
nonsense, but the number six
was everywhere in this year's Big
Game festivities. Appropriately,
here are the top six examples:
1) The streaks. Stanford in
creased its winning streak
against Cal to six games, tying
the longest streak in the series'
history. The previous six-game
winning streak by the Cardinal
ended in, of course, 1 !)(>(>.
Stanford head coach Tyrone
VVillingham also extended his
unblemished record as head
coach in Big Games to (*>-(). Will
ingham's solid decision-making
over the past few years helped
allow this year's group of se
niors, including "Trench Dogs"
Willie Howard and Riall John
son, to finish their Stanford ca
reers without ever having to give
up the cherished axe.
"I'll always be able to say I
never lost to (Cal," said 1 lovvard.
2) The MVP. Sporting his
number six jersey, sophomore
wide receiver Luke Powell took
home plaver of the game honors
— and lint good reason. Powell's
75-yard touchdown reception
from Rand) Fasani with 1:17 to
play in the game broke a 23-23
tie, giving the Cardinal a much
needed cushion.
Powell, a player whom Stan
ford fans should get used to
watching over the next two sea
sons. c reated all 75 yards on the
reception. First, he showed his
speed by turning the cornet to
beat Cal cornerback Harold
Pearson. I lien, after extending
his arms toward the lirst down
market, he easily passed Cal
safety Dewey Hale, who
thought Powell had run out of
bounds.
3) The opponent. Also wear
ing a number six jersey was (Cal's
running back, Joe Igber. After
being held to only three yards in
the first half, Igber scored two
touchdowns in the second half,
wreaking havoc on the Cardinal

defense.
Igber's first touchdown run
for 27 yards gave Cal its only
lead of the game. His second
touchdown run, a nine-yard
scamper through the defensive
line, tied the game at HO and sent
it to overtime.
4) The difference in the
game's score. Six points, 36-30,
was all that separated the two ri
vals. A crucial six points they
were. Fasani's 25-yard touch
down pass to a wide-open Casey
Moore came on a play that
had not been called all-season
long.
"We've been preparing all
this year for the right place and
time to run this play." said Will
ingham.
Good call, coach. ()vei time of
Big Game? Certainly the right
place, right time.
Moore, who wears number 33
(do the addition), has now
played key roles in the past two
Big Games, scoring two touch
downs last year and two more
this year, including the game
winning reception from Fasani.-
1 he p.iss "felt like it was sit
ting up there all day, Moore
said. "I was just trying to look ii
into my hands, because I knew I
was all alone out there."'
5) Turnovers. There were six
turnovers in all — Stanford with
one and Cal with live. Corner
back Brian Taylor, who wears
the number 15 (again, do the
math), was an unlikely hero in
the first half with two intercep
tions. His first interception off
Cal quarterback Kyle Boiler in
the second quarter set up a scor
ing drive that extended the (Car
dinal lead to 1 (i-7.
(i) Total points scored. (">(). Be
lieve n or not, the (>C» combined
points put up by Stanford and
Cal was the highest total in the
103-vcar history of Big (iame.
So, six was the magic number
for the (Cardinal in the 103 rd Big
(iame. Quite ironic, considering
ihis vcar's squad barely missed
reaching the six-win minimum
needed to go to a postseason
bowl game.
But to the fans, coaches and
players on Saturday, Big Game
was the postseason, and Stan
lord was victorious.
So celebrate the win, (Cardinal
fans, until next year when the
squad attempts to extend its
streak to lucky number seven.
