"Almost everyone's emissions have gone up since 1000,"
Rant hot I said. " I he I .S. needs to decrease its emissions by 20

Kant hod believes ili.it this is an attempt by the United

"It's aina/ing that our country is sort ol stalling in the late

Stanlbrd's delegation will be involved in lobbying dele

world, speaking with the press and educating others about
these deliberations.
In Kvoto, | a p. in.in Deceinbei 1007, delegates to the third
('.< >n lei cut e ol Parlies agreed i<» a protocol commit! ing t level

I lie mechanisms include an emissions trading svslein,
joint implementation ol emissions-reduction projects be

countries.
"Almost everyone's emissions have gone up since 1000,"
Rant hot I said. " I he I .S. needs to decrease its emissions by 20
percent to Ik* in compliance with the 1007 l okyo agreement,
because we've increased our pollutit hi."
Jackson agreed, saying t hat "global w arming is not as com
plicated to understand as some w ill have you believe; ii is .is
sitnph wrong as stealing. I he developed world — and prin
< ipalh the I nited States — has stolen the clean air from the
iesi ol the planet. And now we are asking those with the least
resources it) pay the price for ibis crime."
Act ording to Kant hod, the I .S. policy is to make it clear
that the I LS. plans to meet <S0 percent ol Us emissions reduc
tion without anv domestic changes.
Kant hod believes ili.it this is an attempt by the United
Slates, to create loopholes within the treaty so at I hey will
comph, without having done anything to lower their
emissions.
"It's aina/ing that our country is sort ol stalling in the late
ol the mounting science." Rant hod said.
I he 1000 report ol the Intergovernmental Panel on ( li
inate ( liange lountl that there might be human involvement
ill the cause ol'( lianges in the climate. I he panel's 100") report
suggested a (list ernible human impact on climate change.
In a new draft report, the panel revised its earlier predic
tions on temperature int leases by the year 2100 from an in
c lease ol one to !i.(> degrees ( '.elsius to an increase ol I.!> lot). 1
degrees (.elsius.
" I hat means lor ('.aliibrnians we would be exposed to in
< leased droughts, more strewed up F1 Nino patterns, with
potential Hooding," Rant hod said.
While delegates in Kvoto agreed to these emissions reduc
tions targets antl met hot Is, it was leli lor subset 11 let it meetings

Although mam touniries have signed the protocol, the
majority— int luding the I nited Slates — are waiting until
these operational details are negotiated before deciding
whether to ratilv.

" I w as lortunale enough to go to a smaller < >nc ol these last
