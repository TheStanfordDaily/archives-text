# Absentee ballots in; judge to hear election appeals
## 
### 
(AP) — Lawvcrs for George W. Bush asked the
Florida Supreme Court lo halt the continued hand
recount of ballots in the state's disputed presidential
election, arguing in a court filing yesterday that state
law sets out a clear deadline for vote returns.
Bush argued ahead of a showdown hearing today
that Florida election law provides for one week ol'bal
lot counting alter the election. I "hat deadline passed
Nov. 14 and Bush argued that the stale's top election
official was correct when she stuck to the deadline.
"The secretary's conduct was reasoned and rea
sonable," Bush's lawyers wrote of Republican Secre
tary of State Katherine Harris.
She followed Florida law exactly, and it would have
been illegal for her to extend the deadline, Bush ar
gued.
"It would also violate the U.S. Constitution for the
Secretary of State to permit the counties to complete
its (sic) manual recount and certify those results,"
Bush's lawyers argued. "The selective manual re
counts authorize county boards to engage in arbitrary

and unequal counting of votes,
and result in the disparate treat
ment of Florida voters based sole
ly on where within the state they
happen to reside."
I larris also filed a brief with the
state high court, saying she acted
correctly. She said Democrats
were making up Florida law as
they went along, raising more is
sues as each day passes, but also
criticized Republicans as well.
"The Democrats' perspective is
that the election code has to be
read as mandating that each vot
ers intent, irrespective of whether
t lie voter has properly punched or
marked his or her ballot must take
precedence over statutory dead
lines, the constitutional construc
tion of statutes, and the disc retion
and operative duties of executive
officers," she wrote.
"The Republicans, not to be
outdone, are complaining about
procedures for manual recount
ing and the sanctity of the machine
tabulation," Harris wrote. "It is
clear, that for the Democrats and
the Republicans, the object is to
win, and that is understandable.
The stakes are very high."
Democratic vice-presidential
nominee Joseph Lieberman said
Sunday that Florida vote-counters
should "take another look" at mili
tary absentee ballots that were
thrown out on narrow technicalities.
County canvassers disqualified
1,527 ballots from overseas, many
because they lacked the required
postmark. But Lieberman said
vote counters should "give the
benefit of the doubt" to ballots
coming in from military personnel
generally.
"If they have the capacity, I'd
urge them to go back and take an
other look," he said on NBC's
"Meet the Press."
Bush gained 1,380 votes to Al
Gore's 750 from a count of the
overseas absentee ballots, but sup
porters of the Texas governor

complained thai Democrats were
trying to disqualify military ballots
because they were more likely to
favor the G()1\
"They knew those votes pri
marily were Bush voles," said Sen.
Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., on
AIM "s " This Week."
Defense Secretary William
Cohen, the only Republican in the
Cabinet, also expressed concern
over the large number of disquali
fied ballots.
"The last thing we want to do is
make it harder lor those wearing
our uniform and serving overseas
to be able to cast a ballot," he said
Sunday in Saudi Arabia.
Meanwhile, Miami-Dade
County began a mechanical sort
ing of 654,000 punch-card ballots
after a judge rejected a request by
Bush supporters to keep the bal
lots out of a machine.
Hand recounting of ballots in
two other heavily Democratic
counties—Broward and Palm
Beach — also resumed yesterday.
In Broward, with 277 of 609
precincts counted, Gore had
gained 85 votes.
In Palm Beach, the county
judge overseeing the process
pleaded with the counters and ob
servers for civility after a fracas
broke out when a counter acciden
tally put a ballot in the wrong pile.
"You would have thought she'd
killed 14 people," said Judge
Charles Burton, a Democrat and
chairman of t lie county canvassing
board.
Lieberman, who made the
round ol the Sunday morning talk
shows, said Republic ans opposed
a recount out of fear that Bush's
statewide lead of 930 votes would
evaporate.
"I wouldn't say that they are
trying to steal the election, but it
does seem to me very c learly that
they are doing everything t hey c an
to stop the recounting of votes be
cause they're slightly ahead, and
they tear after the recounting they
won't be," Lieberman said on
(.BS's "Face the Nation."
Bush and his wife I .aura went

to church yesterday in Austin,
Texas; Gore was in Washington.
No matter who wins the elec
tion, President Clinton said the
American people may benefit by
the closeness of the race.
"It might be sobering for the
country to realize that we are in a
completely new era," Clinton said
in a (<NN interview. "It is still clear
that about two-thirds of the people
want a dynamic center that pulls
the people together and moves us
forward."
In a unanimous ruling Friday,
the Supreme Court stopped Har
ris from disallowing the hand re
counts and certifying Bush the
winner, pending further notice
from the court.
Democrats planned to ask the
Supreme C lourt to establish a stan
dard under which all three coun
ties would approve or disapprove
ballots. I hey say Palm Beach
County officials are imposing a
strict standard that lias cost Gore
scores of voles.
In one precinct. Gore picked
up I I votes in a sample recount
conducted more than a week ago.
When the same precinct was
counted Saturday. Gore had lost
1 1 votes from the first recount.
In addition to the appeals in
Florida, both campaigns also have
pending cases in federal courts
that aim to affect the outcome.
Republicans sav Democ rats art
conducting a flawed recount; De

File unprecedented election af
termath has left Bush and Gore
dangling and the nation without a
president-elect 12 days after the
votes were cast. Neither man
emerged from Election Day with
enough Fleet oral College votes to
claim victory. Without Florida,
Gore has 207 and Bush 240, with
270 needed to win.
That made Florida the dec isive
state.
Gore continued to lead in the
nationwide popular vote by about
215,000 votes out of the more than

(AP) — Lawvcrs for George W. Bush asked the
Florida Supreme Court lo halt the continued hand
recount of ballots in the state's disputed presidential
election, arguing in a court filing yesterday that state
law sets out a clear deadline for vote returns.
Bush argued ahead of a showdown hearing today
that Florida election law provides for one week ol'bal
lot counting alter the election. I "hat deadline passed
Nov. 14 and Bush argued that the stale's top election
official was correct when she stuck to the deadline.
"The secretary's conduct was reasoned and rea
sonable," Bush's lawyers wrote of Republican Secre
tary of State Katherine Harris.
She followed Florida law exactly, and it would have
been illegal for her to extend the deadline, Bush ar
gued.
"It would also violate the U.S. Constitution for the
Secretary of State to permit the counties to complete
its (sic) manual recount and certify those results,"
Bush's lawyers argued. "The selective manual re
counts authorize county boards to engage in arbitrary

and unequal counting of votes,
and result in the disparate treat
ment of Florida voters based sole
ly on where within the state they
happen to reside."
I larris also filed a brief with the
state high court, saying she acted
correctly. She said Democrats
were making up Florida law as
they went along, raising more is
sues as each day passes, but also
criticized Republicans as well.
"The Democrats' perspective is
that the election code has to be
read as mandating that each vot
ers intent, irrespective of whether
t lie voter has properly punched or
marked his or her ballot must take
precedence over statutory dead
lines, the constitutional construc
tion of statutes, and the disc retion
and operative duties of executive
officers," she wrote.
"The Republicans, not to be
outdone, are complaining about
procedures for manual recount
ing and the sanctity of the machine
tabulation," Harris wrote. "It is
clear, that for the Democrats and
the Republicans, the object is to
win, and that is understandable.
The stakes are very high."
Democratic vice-presidential
nominee Joseph Lieberman said
Sunday that Florida vote-counters
should "take another look" at mili
tary absentee ballots that were
thrown out on narrow technicalities.
County canvassers disqualified
1,527 ballots from overseas, many
because they lacked the required
postmark. But Lieberman said
vote counters should "give the
benefit of the doubt" to ballots
coming in from military personnel
generally.
"If they have the capacity, I'd
urge them to go back and take an
other look," he said on NBC's
"Meet the Press."
Bush gained 1,380 votes to Al
Gore's 750 from a count of the
overseas absentee ballots, but sup
porters of the Texas governor

complained thai Democrats were
trying to disqualify military ballots
because they were more likely to
favor the G()1\
"They knew those votes pri
marily were Bush voles," said Sen.
Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., on
AIM "s " This Week."
Defense Secretary William
Cohen, the only Republican in the
Cabinet, also expressed concern
over the large number of disquali
fied ballots.
"The last thing we want to do is
make it harder lor those wearing
our uniform and serving overseas
to be able to cast a ballot," he said
Sunday in Saudi Arabia.
Meanwhile, Miami-Dade
County began a mechanical sort
ing of 654,000 punch-card ballots
after a judge rejected a request by
Bush supporters to keep the bal
lots out of a machine.
Hand recounting of ballots in
two other heavily Democratic
counties—Broward and Palm
Beach — also resumed yesterday.
In Broward, with 277 of 609
precincts counted, Gore had
gained 85 votes.
In Palm Beach, the county
judge overseeing the process
pleaded with the counters and ob
servers for civility after a fracas
broke out when a counter acciden
tally put a ballot in the wrong pile.
"You would have thought she'd
killed 14 people," said Judge
Charles Burton, a Democrat and
chairman of t lie county canvassing
board.
