## 
### JULIANA LIU EDITORIAL STAFF 
Following a protest by the
American Indian community over
a Big Game Gaieiies scene, the
Ram's Head Theatrical Society
hoard of directors cut the segment
Friday and removed the show's
producer from his duties last
night.
The hoard of directors cut out a
scene in White Pla/a scene pro
moting the Stanford Powwow
after members of the American In
dian community expressed out
rage. board members said.
"We were having a good time
until that scene," said junior Travis
I lelms, a member of the American
Indian community. "[Then] we
were more open to seeing the dif
ferent stereotypes being por
trayed, how spt'< ili< communities
were being slammed."

In the Wednesday and Thurs
day performances, the White
I'la/.a scene featured actors repre
senting six groups vying for stu
dent members. The groups in
cluded the Viennese Ball, the Re
serve Officers Training Corp, the
Capital Improvement Plan, the
Stanford Sheriffs and the Stanford
Powwow.
According to the show's pro
ducer, Patrick Crosetto, a junior,
the actors were supposed to repre
sent the Village People.
He said Gaieties was tradition
ally a chance for everyone to laugh
at him or herself .
"Realistically, 1 don't feel the
scene should have been removed,"
he said. "1 had no problem toning
it down."
In an e-mail circulated to the
American Indian community after
the Thursday performance,
Helms charged the production
with "institutional racism."
"The sign on the booth had
crudely drawn pictures of teepees,
bows and arrows," he wrote. "The
person representing the Powwow
booth was a blonde, white female
dressed in a brown dress with
fringe, trying to look Indian, and
black leather boots. Ihroughout
the skit she pantomimed 'Indian
sign language,' the Sacred Pipe
traditions, 'war whoops' and
pranced around the booth."
Helms wrote that the produc
tion "mocked us, our traditions,
our beliefs."
Crosetto responded to the ini
tial e-mail by apologizing lor any
perceived offense and by defend
ing the scene. He stressed the di
versity of the show's staff and cast
but ultimately refused to eliminate
the character.
" The Native American in the
scene was placed only because we
wanted to joke about the Village
People," Crosetto wrote. "We did
not intend to offend anyone, nor
did we think this would offend
anyone."
University President John Hen
nessy said last night that "Gaieties
has, by tradition, satirized many
situations on campus. Nonethe
less. 1 do not think that the Gaieties
or Rain's Head staff intended the
scene to be offensive to any specific
community on campus."
Board member Galen Davis, a
junior, said he received the e-mail
from Helms at about 3 a.m. on
Friday.
Though the Ram's 1 lead board
reviewed the entire script before
production, committee members
were not able to screen out the ob
jectionable aspects of the scene,
Davis said.
"What happened was not in the
script," he said. "The script says
there are representatives from sev
eral organizations and each repre
sentative has a line; that scene had

nothing racist about it at all."
Senior Anne l erry, the actress
portraying the American Indian,
declined to comment.
Davis said board members did
not attend dress rehearsals.
Three of live board members
attended the Thursday night per
formance, according to board
member and Drama Lecturer Ali
son Duxbury. Members did not re
spond to ilie scene until after
1 lelm's first e-mail.
Davis said he and fellow board
member |ason Mendelson, '00,
agreed to remove the "objection

able material." They needed one
more member to consent, so they
woke np junior Kateri Mcßae,
Davis recalled.
At about 5 a.m. on Friday, Davis
e-mailed Helms pledging to meet
with students at the Native Ameri
can Cultural ("enter later in the
day.
Students offended by the scene
met together to decide what they
wanted to express to the board at
ihe next meeting. The group
wanted the scene to be removed.
"Kveryone coming in wanted at
least having the Indian person

out," Helms said. "We knew it
would be hard [for the show stall]
to change the scene within eight
hours."
Indeed, students were not the
only ones concerned about the
White Plaza scene.
Dean of Students Marc VVais
said the four administrators mak
ing appearances in the show him
self, University President John
Hennessy, Dean of Admissions
and Financial Aid Robin Mamlet
and Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs James Montoya had consid
ered pulling out of the Friday per
formance after complaints began.
According to VVais, a group of
approximately 35 people, includ
ing directors of the Native Ameri
can Cultural Center, the LCBCC
and El CentroChicano, all six lead
ers of Ram's Head, show director
Ryan Laponis, a junior, and senior
and ASSU Vice President Malia
Villegas, met to discuss the situa
tion.
Crosetto, who did not attend
the meeting said he was not invited
and therefore effectively shut out
of the dialogue.
At the hour-long meeting, stu
dents offended by the show and
the representatives of Ram's 1 lead
expressed their views on how to re
solve the conflict. The board of di
rectors agreed to replace the Pow
wow table with a table sponsored
by the fictitious Yacht Club.
Participants agreed that the po
tentially divisive and emotional
meeting was non-confrontational,
productive and professional.
"1 was so happy," Davis said.
"Everyone was open and recep
tive. On both sides, we feared that
people would be very angry and
belligerent."
Duxbury said that as a result of
the meeting, Ram's Head will im
plement new policies aimed at
stemming potentially offensive
content.
"I think Gaieties lias become
more objectionable over time, not
less," she said. "Hopefully we can
find ways of creating humor. You
can laugh at people without pok
ing fun at something sacred to
them."
Duxbury said the board of di

rectors will get more involved in
show production in the future and
will send drafts of the scripts to
members of ethnic communities.
Representatives will also be en
couraged to attend run-throughs
and look at the design material,
she said.
"I was impressed by [the
board's] professional manners
throughout the whole thing,"
Ifelms said. "It was in no way their
fault."
Helms blames "the producer
and others in the show."
"My faith in Stanford students
was renewed as a result of the con
versation," Wais said. "I was de
lighted to see students talking to
fellow students for the common
goal of trying to right a wrong and
to try to respond to the concerns
and needs articulated by the Na
tive community and other commu
nities."
Wais said he was impressed by
the quality of the conversation and
the creativity of the suggestions on
how to respond to this in a respon
sible, sensitive way.
Still, even after the last perfor
mance on Friday, the fallout from
the incident has not ended.
Last night, the board of direc
tors voted to remove Crosetto
from his job as producer, accord
ing to Duxbury. She said the board
did not want him to continue
speaking on behalf of Ram's I lead.
Crosetto maintains he tried
very hard to make the (iaieties staff
and cast as diverse as possible. I Ie
thought the students who spoke
out alter the Thursday show were
also at fault.
"I think this was activism gone
awry," he Said. Ife said he would
have responded in a more positive
manner had Helms contacted him
directly instead of trying to invoke
a "groundswell of anti-Gaieties
sentiment."
Sophomore Ahby Phelps, the
show's press relations manager,
agreed with (Irosetto.
"Given the sort of pressure ex
erted on Ram's I lead by several in
dividuals and by the members <>l
the administration, I understand
why they were compelled to pull
the Powwow table," she said.

Phelps argued that Gaieties is
and should be caustic and feature
occasionally stupid humor.
"If all scenes which were po
tentially offensive to minority or
other groups were to be re
moved, nothing would remain,"
she said. "Everyone going to Gai
eties knows they are in fora night
of shocking and offensive humor,
and anyone who does not find
such humor amusing should sim
ply not go."
Sophomore Felicia Frizzell, who
attended the performance with
Helms, said "we couldn't believe
how the pantomiming was going."
Frizzell said she and her room
mate Willow Miller-Young had
just slat ted a dorm program to ed
ucate students about American In
dians.
"It is so much harder to teach
people when they think we're al
ways dressed like the actress is
dressed, that we do sign lan
guage," she said.
Junior Rene Saenz, who attend
ed the Friday meeting and admit
ted to boycotting this year's show,
applauded the decision to alter the
scene.
"There is a big difference be
tween a community playfully mak
ing fun of itself or a sports rival,
and a group majority mocking and
caricaturing the cultural and sa
iled traditions of an under-repre
sented minority," he said.
According to Saenz, mocking
the cultures of minorities only
serves to perpetuate (he cultural
indifference and racist stereotypes
that many Stanford students have
internalized. Saenz said it was iron
ic and telling that a group of Stan
ford men jumped into the Claw
fountain and "whooped and did
Tomahawk cheers" at the time of
the Friday meeting.
Freshman Kan Doyle, an
American Indian and a member of
Testimony a cappella, a group that
was much maligned during the
show, said she harbors no resent
ment toward the show staff.
"It just reminds me that no mat
ter where you are, people are al
ways unaware of what s going to be
hurtful for others," she said. "No
one is immune from that. I'm not."

American Indian community over
a Big Game Gaieiies scene, the
Ram's Head Theatrical Society
hoard of directors cut the segment
Friday and removed the show's
producer from his duties last
night.
The hoard of directors cut out a
scene in White Pla/a scene pro
moting the Stanford Powwow
after members of the American In
dian community expressed out
rage. board members said.
"We were having a good time
until that scene," said junior Travis
I lelms, a member of the American
Indian community. "[Then] we
were more open to seeing the dif
ferent stereotypes being por
trayed, how spt'< ili< communities
were being slammed."

In the Wednesday and Thurs
day performances, the White
I'la/.a scene featured actors repre
senting six groups vying for stu
dent members. The groups in
cluded the Viennese Ball, the Re
serve Officers Training Corp, the
Capital Improvement Plan, the
Stanford Sheriffs and the Stanford
Powwow.
According to the show's pro
ducer, Patrick Crosetto, a junior,
the actors were supposed to repre
sent the Village People.
He said Gaieties was tradition
ally a chance for everyone to laugh
at him or herself .
"Realistically, 1 don't feel the
scene should have been removed,"
he said. "1 had no problem toning
it down."
In an e-mail circulated to the
American Indian community after
the Thursday performance,
Helms charged the production
with "institutional racism."
"The sign on the booth had
crudely drawn pictures of teepees,
bows and arrows," he wrote. "The
person representing the Powwow
booth was a blonde, white female
dressed in a brown dress with
fringe, trying to look Indian, and
black leather boots. Ihroughout
the skit she pantomimed 'Indian
sign language,' the Sacred Pipe
traditions, 'war whoops' and
pranced around the booth."
Helms wrote that the produc
tion "mocked us, our traditions,
our beliefs."
Crosetto responded to the ini
tial e-mail by apologizing lor any
perceived offense and by defend
ing the scene. He stressed the di
versity of the show's staff and cast
but ultimately refused to eliminate
the character.
" The Native American in the
scene was placed only because we
wanted to joke about the Village
People," Crosetto wrote. "We did
not intend to offend anyone, nor
did we think this would offend
anyone."
University President John Hen
nessy said last night that "Gaieties
has, by tradition, satirized many
situations on campus. Nonethe
less. 1 do not think that the Gaieties
or Rain's Head staff intended the
scene to be offensive to any specific
community on campus."
Board member Galen Davis, a
junior, said he received the e-mail
from Helms at about 3 a.m. on
Friday.
Though the Ram's 1 lead board
reviewed the entire script before
production, committee members
were not able to screen out the ob
jectionable aspects of the scene,
Davis said.
"What happened was not in the
script," he said. "The script says
there are representatives from sev
eral organizations and each repre
sentative has a line; that scene had

nothing racist about it at all."
Senior Anne l erry, the actress
portraying the American Indian,
declined to comment.
Davis said board members did
not attend dress rehearsals.
Three of live board members
attended the Thursday night per
formance, according to board
member and Drama Lecturer Ali
son Duxbury. Members did not re
spond to ilie scene until after
1 lelm's first e-mail.
Davis said he and fellow board
member |ason Mendelson, '00,
agreed to remove the "objection

able material." They needed one
more member to consent, so they
woke np junior Kateri Mcßae,
Davis recalled.
At about 5 a.m. on Friday, Davis
e-mailed Helms pledging to meet
with students at the Native Ameri
can Cultural ("enter later in the
day.
Students offended by the scene
met together to decide what they
wanted to express to the board at
ihe next meeting. The group
wanted the scene to be removed.
"Kveryone coming in wanted at
least having the Indian person

out," Helms said. "We knew it
would be hard [for the show stall]
to change the scene within eight
hours."
Indeed, students were not the
only ones concerned about the
White Plaza scene.
Dean of Students Marc VVais
said the four administrators mak
ing appearances in the show him
self, University President John
Hennessy, Dean of Admissions
and Financial Aid Robin Mamlet
and Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs James Montoya had consid
ered pulling out of the Friday per
formance after complaints began.
According to VVais, a group of
approximately 35 people, includ
ing directors of the Native Ameri
can Cultural Center, the LCBCC
and El CentroChicano, all six lead
ers of Ram's Head, show director
Ryan Laponis, a junior, and senior
and ASSU Vice President Malia
Villegas, met to discuss the situa
tion.
Crosetto, who did not attend
the meeting said he was not invited
and therefore effectively shut out
of the dialogue.
At the hour-long meeting, stu
dents offended by the show and
the representatives of Ram's 1 lead
expressed their views on how to re
solve the conflict. The board of di
rectors agreed to replace the Pow
wow table with a table sponsored
by the fictitious Yacht Club.
Participants agreed that the po
tentially divisive and emotional
meeting was non-confrontational,
productive and professional.
"1 was so happy," Davis said.
"Everyone was open and recep
tive. On both sides, we feared that
people would be very angry and
belligerent."
Duxbury said that as a result of
the meeting, Ram's Head will im
plement new policies aimed at
stemming potentially offensive
content.
"I think Gaieties lias become
more objectionable over time, not
less," she said. "Hopefully we can
find ways of creating humor. You
can laugh at people without pok
ing fun at something sacred to
them."
Duxbury said the board of di

rectors will get more involved in
show production in the future and
will send drafts of the scripts to
members of ethnic communities.
Representatives will also be en
couraged to attend run-throughs
and look at the design material,
she said.
"I was impressed by [the
board's] professional manners
throughout the whole thing,"
Ifelms said. "It was in no way their
fault."
Helms blames "the producer
and others in the show."
"My faith in Stanford students
was renewed as a result of the con
versation," Wais said. "I was de
lighted to see students talking to
fellow students for the common
goal of trying to right a wrong and
to try to respond to the concerns
and needs articulated by the Na
tive community and other commu
nities."
Wais said he was impressed by
the quality of the conversation and
the creativity of the suggestions on
how to respond to this in a respon
sible, sensitive way.
Still, even after the last perfor
mance on Friday, the fallout from
the incident has not ended.
Last night, the board of direc
tors voted to remove Crosetto
from his job as producer, accord
ing to Duxbury. She said the board
did not want him to continue
speaking on behalf of Ram's I lead.
Crosetto maintains he tried
very hard to make the (iaieties staff
and cast as diverse as possible. I Ie
thought the students who spoke
out alter the Thursday show were
also at fault.
"I think this was activism gone
awry," he Said. Ife said he would
have responded in a more positive
manner had Helms contacted him
directly instead of trying to invoke
a "groundswell of anti-Gaieties
sentiment."
Sophomore Ahby Phelps, the
show's press relations manager,
agreed with (Irosetto.
"Given the sort of pressure ex
erted on Ram's I lead by several in
dividuals and by the members <>l
the administration, I understand
why they were compelled to pull
the Powwow table," she said.

Phelps argued that Gaieties is
and should be caustic and feature
occasionally stupid humor.
"If all scenes which were po
tentially offensive to minority or
other groups were to be re
moved, nothing would remain,"
she said. "Everyone going to Gai
eties knows they are in fora night
of shocking and offensive humor,
and anyone who does not find
such humor amusing should sim
ply not go."
Sophomore Felicia Frizzell, who
attended the performance with
Helms, said "we couldn't believe
how the pantomiming was going."
Frizzell said she and her room
mate Willow Miller-Young had
just slat ted a dorm program to ed
ucate students about American In
dians.
"It is so much harder to teach
people when they think we're al
ways dressed like the actress is
dressed, that we do sign lan
guage," she said.
Junior Rene Saenz, who attend
ed the Friday meeting and admit
ted to boycotting this year's show,
applauded the decision to alter the
scene.
"There is a big difference be
tween a community playfully mak
ing fun of itself or a sports rival,
and a group majority mocking and
caricaturing the cultural and sa
iled traditions of an under-repre
sented minority," he said.
According to Saenz, mocking
the cultures of minorities only
serves to perpetuate (he cultural
indifference and racist stereotypes
that many Stanford students have
internalized. Saenz said it was iron
ic and telling that a group of Stan
ford men jumped into the Claw
fountain and "whooped and did
Tomahawk cheers" at the time of
the Friday meeting.
Freshman Kan Doyle, an
American Indian and a member of
Testimony a cappella, a group that
was much maligned during the
show, said she harbors no resent
ment toward the show staff.
"It just reminds me that no mat
ter where you are, people are al
ways unaware of what s going to be
hurtful for others," she said. "No
one is immune from that. I'm not."
