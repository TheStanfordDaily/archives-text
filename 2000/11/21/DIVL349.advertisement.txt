A CALL TO ACTION:
STANFORD'S COMMUNITY CENTERS
As an institution ol higher education, Stanford University faces the task of preparing its students to participate conscientiously and effectively in an
increasingly complex world. In fields ranging from engineering to creative writing, Stanford excels in this mission, but there is one arena in which our
university falls embarrassingly short. Community centers on campus (the Native American Cultural Center; the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender
Community Center; the Women's Community Center; the Black Community Services Center; El Centro Chicano; and the Asian American Activities Center)
address this arena by providing individual students and student organizations with social space, work space, and support services that foster an inclusive
learning environment for all students. In a role that goes largely unrecognized, these centers provide an open space not only for their specified
constituencies (women, people of color, and transgender/bisexual/ queer/lesbian/gay people) but for all students to gather together to engage in the
challenge of building networks that are diverse in race, ethnicity, culture, nationality, class, belief, gender, sexuality, and ability. Centers' academic and
social programming heightens campus awareness about how we define community and diversity on campus, thus complementing the learning that takes
place within the traditional classroom setting. Through such work, the centers support the development of student leaders who enhance students'
understanding of both their own and each others' cultures and histories. Community centers constitute Stanford's opportunity to prepare students to be
innovators in the building of a \ ital communal and civic life both on campus and beyond. Towards this end, community centers offer
In light of the reasoning presented above and the experiences of these six communities under the current system, we have identified three major problem
areas created by University policies: insufficient resources; the inability of community centers to fundraise; and the impermanence of both funding and
physical space.
Insufficient resources
Minimal programming funding that has not been increased, even to keep pace with
inflation, since it was first instated six years ago
A shortage ol full time employees and lack of money to pay student staff for their hours
I ack ol c apital equipment
Klin down and poorly maintained facilities
Inadequate space for stall work areas, meetings, and events
Inability to fundraise
Stanford University expressly prohibits community centers from fundraising. This restriction places them at a severe
disadvantage in comparison to other Stanford departments, as well as community centers in universities across the country.
Impermanence
; Program funds are allocated on a temporary basis, not secured in the permanent University budget
! No University commitment to provide permanent, sufficient, and central space for community centers as the University
grows and changes
These shortcomings reveal deeper impediments to Stanford's pursuit of its mission: By denying adequate, stable resources to the community centers, the
administration treats them as temporary, quick -fix solutions to the problems that have come with our expanding world — racism, sexism, and homophobia.
No department ol Stanford University should function as a mere band-aid. This attitude represents an egregious underestimation of the centers' potential.
I lie I Jniversity must instead make these centers a pro-active force, capitalizing on difference and diversity as resources — not problems — that can forge a
comprehensive and rigorous educational experience. With this ambition for the University's success in mind, we conclude that Stanford University should
INCREASE funding for
*Student staff positions
" Programming needs
'Capital equipment such as photocopiers and fax machines
"Facility improvements such as working toilets, locks, and air conditioning
GUARANTEE central and sufficient facilities for community centers in current and future campus space allocations
ESTABLISH permanent funding fora minimum of two full-time employees for each center
LOCATE community center funding in the permanent budget of the University not only for staff, but also for programming,
capital equipment, and facilities improvement
REALIZE the community centers' potential to fundraise for themselves by eliminating existing prohibitions on this activity
This proposal v\ as created by a coalition of concerned students. It represents our goal of having the university recognize the integral role that community
centers play in the success of its mission. Although these concerns have been voiced repeatedly by members of the student body, we feel that Stanford has
failed to develop a \ ision for how community centers can prepare its diverse student body to be members of a changing society. A version of this proposal
will be presented to the Provost and President as part of this student effort to secure adequate funds, maintenance, and space for centers that can maximize
the potential of the Stanford community.
