Oil Nov. 21, I %(), The Daily printed an
article titled, "Reporter's Show lii/ Whirl
Knds Alter One Night Stand in Gaieties."
"Ifanyone noticed a slightly confused
cast meniher 111 (iaieties one night lasi week,
sin- was a Daily reporter soaking up atmos
phere lor a story to reveal exactly what goes
on hackslage during .1 perlormance.
"This reporter arrived about an hour be
fore time and was subjected to the rigors ol
the make-up department and a bewildering
set of instructions simplified only by the
stage manager's comment. | usl follow the
person in front of you.
"I ler stage debut in< luded walking
ac ross the stage, playing cards with her back
to the audience, and pretending to know
the words to the songs. I nloi tunatelv, she
I).id no idea as to what the rest ol the per
formers were doing and mulled her big
c hance at .111 acting career. I lowever, the
managing editor bad not told her to learn

Bottom line: If you were wondering who those
random nude people were in Gaieties last week,
now you know.
