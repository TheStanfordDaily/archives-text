## Justices seek to continue recount 
### 
lALLAIIASSEE, Ma. (AP) — Florida
Supreme ('.ourt justices seemed anxious lo find
.1 way out ol the states presidential election jam
vesterday that would let disputed manual re
counts continue — as long as the delay
wouldn't jeopardize the state in the Electoral
(College vote.
I he central questions hanging over the stale
election — should ballots be recounted? I low?
For how long? — landed in Florida's high court
nearly two weeks alter the Nov. 7 vote.
I here was no word on when a ruling might
he e\pe< ted. but some ol the justices showed a
sense of urgent \ lo answer the questions, which
.ue of paramount importance to Democrat Al
(lore and Republic an (ieorge W. Bush.
Ala nationally televised hearing that ran
neai l\ two and one-half hours, the chief judge
ol the court, Charles T. Wells, repeatedl)
pressed both sides lo predict how continued re
counts would allect the Dec. IN Electoral Col
lege vole.
" Fell me when Florida's electoral vote would
be in jeopardv," Wells said to bush lawver
Mi< liael ('.an in, a <|iiestion he had earlier asked
ol I'aul Hancock, lawyer lor the state's Deino
(l ath attorne\ genei al.
both sides s.iid ihe\ were intent on having
Florida's vote counted — no need to note their
disagreement on how they wanted that vote lo
< oiue out.
The hearing dealt only glancinglv with
major issue s that both sides have been lighting
about so hard in other courts and in public
statements.
bin oral arguments in an appeals court are
rarely a comprehensive guide to justices' think
ing. In this case I he court is being asked lo rule
whether the manual recounts requested I»y
Democrats should continue, how the counts
should be done and whether those results

should be included in the final state tally.
Alter the hearing. Gore advisers said pri
vately they were pleased by the tone of the jus
ii<es" questions and the fact that recounts could
continue at least for now.
The Republican legal team expressed pri
vate concerns about what they perceived as
tough questioning and pondered options that
could include an emergency appeal to the U.S.
Supreme ('ourt if necessary.
Garvin, buHeted In questions from Justice
Barbara Pariente, appeared to suggest a GOP
fallback position if the court rules against Bush.
The law. he said in the hearing, "makes ii
dear that ilie federal courts — federal law will
not allow this court or the Florida Legislature to
c hange the rules ol the election after the elec
tion has taken place."
I he justices were vigorous questioners from
the outset, none more so than Wells, the (i 1 -
year-old Democ rat who presided.
Over and over, he asked al what point the
state would risk missing the c hanc e to cast its 25
electoral votes. Sometimes, he punctuated the
question with outstretched arms.
Both Bush and Gore need those 2"> votes lo
win the White 1 louse.
Wells's questions at one point sketched a sce
nario in which recounts would continue, per
haps into December.
Democrats said Dec. 12 was when Florida
needed to have its results final, six clays before
the Electoral College meets. But Joe Klock,
representing Florida Secretary of St ate Kather
ine Harris, said she was bound by a state law
ill.ii required her to c ertify all ballots except for
ovc i seas absentees bv seven days after the Nov.
7 election.
At the same lime, asked by Justice Harry Fee
Anstead whether the seven-clay limit was absolute,
Klock conceded, "()f course it's not absolute."

The justices ruled last Friday that Harris
could not yet certify a winner and that the re
counts could continue — though taking no po
sition on whether those recounts must eventu
ally be included. The Gore campaign, still trail
ing, hopes the recounts will give the vice presi
dent the presidency.
At one point yesterday, Wells seemed lo sug
gest that Harris might be permitted to certify a
winner soon, so Democ rats would have time to
challenge the next step in the process — appoint
ment of the state's electors — and si ill resolve the
dispute before the Electoral College meets.
Gore lawyer David Boies rebutt.ed that Re
publicans would jump on any certification as
evidence (hat the election was settled and "over
with."
He asked the justices not to allow appoint
ment ol the electors vet, but added, "I'm not
urging in any way that this court do anything
that would imperil Florida's electoral votes.'
"They're asking, 'I low do we count the votes
of people who have not been counted without
jeopardizing those that have been counted?"'
said Laurie Levenson, professor al Loyola Uni
versity Lavs School in Los Angeles.
The proceedings were carried live on the
major television networks, providing Ameri
cans with a brief lesson in constitutional and
election law. Wells noted the extraordinary cir
c umslanc es at the start of the hearing.
" I he court is certainly aware of the historic
nature of this session and is aware that this is a
matter of utmost and vital importance to our
nation, our state and our world," he said at the

7 election.
At the same lime, asked by Justice Harry Fee
Anstead whether the seven-clay limit was absolute,
Klock conceded, "()f course it's not absolute."

The justices ruled last Friday that Harris
could not yet certify a winner and that the re
counts could continue — though taking no po
sition on whether those recounts must eventu
ally be included. The Gore campaign, still trail
ing, hopes the recounts will give the vice presi
dent the presidency.
At one point yesterday, Wells seemed lo sug
gest that Harris might be permitted to certify a
winner soon, so Democ rats would have time to
challenge the next step in the process — appoint
ment of the state's electors — and si ill resolve the
dispute before the Electoral College meets.
Gore lawyer David Boies rebutt.ed that Re
publicans would jump on any certification as
evidence (hat the election was settled and "over
with."
He asked the justices not to allow appoint
ment ol the electors vet, but added, "I'm not
urging in any way that this court do anything
that would imperil Florida's electoral votes.'
"They're asking, 'I low do we count the votes
of people who have not been counted without
jeopardizing those that have been counted?"'
said Laurie Levenson, professor al Loyola Uni
versity Lavs School in Los Angeles.
The proceedings were carried live on the
major television networks, providing Ameri
cans with a brief lesson in constitutional and
election law. Wells noted the extraordinary cir
c umslanc es at the start of the hearing.
" I he court is certainly aware of the historic
nature of this session and is aware that this is a
matter of utmost and vital importance to our
nation, our state and our world," he said at the
start.
