Stanford has managed i<> fail the majority of fresh
man students in providing substantive advising
[luring their first crucial year.
()neof the fundamental flaws in the program is
the lat k of con net tion between freshman advisers
,iud their students. Most end up with a random, al
beit pleasant, adviser who may oi may not have
,ni\ relevant experience iti that student's field of
interest. Although we sincerely appreciate the
work of these avid volunteers, dinners at the
Mango ('.tie with vour advising group don't pro
\ ide the at atlemit guidance many freshmen need,
there should be some method of insuring that

freshman are meeting often with their advisers in
a significant way.
We support the current activities of the fresh
man advising system hut propose that major
changes be made in order for the system to play a
viable role in the lives of freshmen. Instead of re
iving solely on their freshman advisers, we suggest
that the Undergraduate Advising Center main
taina group of trained advising professionals to act
as a mandatory stop for freshman. We recognize
that the UAC currently employs such profession
als, but we think they could be put to better use.
While the freshman advisers can answer gener
al questions about academic life and provide sup
port, the staff in the UAC could act as the main
guide to specific questions about majors or career
options. Requiring students to check in with these
staff members each quarter would alleviate the
number of scheduling and academic problems of
freshmen. These professionals would also be in an

appropriate place to offer informed advice about
both specific academic issues and larger long-term
ones. Furthermore, they would be very useful in
managing the freshman advisers and answering
any questions they have.
We do not support eliminating the small-group
struct lire ofthe current advising system, but we do
believe that the freshman advisers should better
understand the integral role they play within the
system.
I lien there is the perennial request for more
faculty volunteering as freshman advisers. We un
derstand that faculty members are busy with up
perclassmen, graduate students and research, but
the experience of having a faculty member as a
freshman adviser is valuable. From their first week
on the Farm, students should have direct contact
with someone who intimately knows the academ
ic world. A faculty freshman adviser also acts as a
liaison between older and younger students and

entourages the freshman to get involved early on
in research.
As Associate Dean of Students Morris Graves
suggested, faculty members may not be interested
in working as freshman advisers because they
have little incentive compared to other activities
that would contribute to a grant of tenure.
Tenured professors would have much more to
add to the University if concentration was given to
how many students they had advised in addition
to how many books they had written.
We support the UAC's efforts to refine the ad
vising system but encourage them to explore the
possibilities of a more concentrated and struc
tured program with knowledgeable and involved
advisers at every level.
We recognize that Stanford has one of the best
and most involved advising sytems among its peer
institutions, but with some effort, the University
can make it much better.
