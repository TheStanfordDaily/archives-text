# I HAVE ISSUES
## Ode to Big Game 
### DANIEL KEMPER DONOVAN STAFF COLUMNIST 
I wcni to Gaieties and laughed, somewhat amused
( I hough most of the time I was simph confused).
I w «iic lied the Axe C omtn blare each precious hour
I ill the lime when the (Cardinal over Blue-Ciold would lower.
And while I didn't trek all the wa\ up to lair Berkeley,
I still queried c urioush late Saturday night,
"Well, who finally won?"
\h heart heating quickly till I discovered
I li.it Stanford, where ( ,il is concerned, is still number one.
During m\ lime here I've come to esteem
Fvcrvthing to do with litis palm-studded scene;
All ol ii is dear i<> ni\ heart and aflbrds me great pleasure.
I ma\ be going too far, keeping in mind
I he sweat-on-display ol I residder Fitness Center.
Yel even the newl\ revamped, alas, unalterable gl<H)in
()f the iwentv-lbur hour hell-on-earth study room
Will alwa\ s be precious to me and mv kind.
But alter one more year ol inevitable win.
I've become fed up with this whole Stanlbrd-Cal din:
I |iisi clon'i understand the basis
I pon which our long-standing rivalry
With Berkele\ was established.
( Mien <n Stanford. I hear people saw
( ,il sik ks. Sianlord doesn't.
We're awesome, lioora)!
Bui how do we rate ourselves,
I low do we measure our relative strength
I (»the s< Ikk)I '( loss the B.i\ ?
In our endeavor to compare the two,
We're quite doomed to tail;
We measure ourselves against (.al with little avail.
Without one single relevant comparison to make,
( )iii supposed "rivali \ with C lal is one colossal lake.
I wo other big rivals. Harvard and Yale,
Are ver\ similar s( hools; in terms ol si/e and setting
Fhev're on the same scale.
Bui Stanford and Berkelev do not compare:
(Mies private, one's public,
(Mies mediutn-si/ed, one's big,
C Mie's set in the suburbs, one's set in the c ity.
And the diflerence in athletic funding between them isn't pretty
I lie disparity Ikm ween the two schools
Rendei s ,i rivalry fruitless since Berkeley is bound to lose.
But then the usual argument goes,
"Whom else could we compete with? What do you propose?
I here's no one near us except Berkeley;
Would you rather we lose all sense of rivalry completely?"
But wh\ should we be tied down to geography?
In ibis fast-paced modern day ol Internet technology
IMn sic al distance matters less and less as time goes on.
What's to stop us from (boosing a rival in Michigan or Iran?
Please, let's pick another rival, not one necessarily better,
But one that's similar to our school, so we two together
I 01111.1 rivalry as delic iouslv volatile as the uncertain weather.
