# I HAVE ISSUES
## Ode to Big Game 
### DANIEL KEMPER DONOVAN STAFF COLUMNIST 
I wcni to Gaieties and laughed, somewhat amused
( I hough most of the time I was simph confused).
I w «iic lied the Axe C omtn blare each precious hour
I ill the lime when the (Cardinal over Blue-Ciold would lower.
And while I didn't trek all the wa\ up to lair Berkeley,
I still queried c urioush late Saturday night,
"Well, who finally won?"
\h heart heating quickly till I discovered
I li.it Stanford, where ( ,il is concerned, is still number one.
During m\ lime here I've come to esteem
Fvcrvthing to do with litis palm-studded scene;
All ol ii is dear i<> ni\ heart and aflbrds me great pleasure.
I ma\ be going too far, keeping in mind
I he sweat-on-display ol I residder Fitness Center.
Yel even the newl\ revamped, alas, unalterable gl<H)in
()f the iwentv-lbur hour hell-on-earth study room
Will alwa\ s be precious to me and mv kind.
But alter one more year ol inevitable win.
I've become fed up with this whole Stanlbrd-Cal din:
I |iisi clon'i understand the basis
I pon which our long-standing rivalry
With Berkele\ was established.
( Mien <n Stanford. I hear people saw
( ,il sik ks. Sianlord doesn't.
We're awesome, lioora)!
Bui how do we rate ourselves,
I low do we measure our relative strength
I (»the s< Ikk)I '( loss the B.i\ ?
In our endeavor to compare the two,
We're quite doomed to tail;
We measure ourselves against (.al with little avail.
Without one single relevant comparison to make,
( )iii supposed "rivali \ with C lal is one colossal lake.
I wo other big rivals. Harvard and Yale,
Are ver\ similar s( hools; in terms ol si/e and setting
Fhev're on the same scale.
Bui Stanford and Berkelev do not compare:
(Mies private, one's public,
(Mies mediutn-si/ed, one's big,
C Mie's set in the suburbs, one's set in the c ity.
And the diflerence in athletic funding between them isn't pretty
I lie disparity Ikm ween the two schools
Rendei s ,i rivalry fruitless since Berkeley is bound to lose.
But then the usual argument goes,
"Whom else could we compete with? What do you propose?
I here's no one near us except Berkeley;
Would you rather we lose all sense of rivalry completely?"
But wh\ should we be tied down to geography?
In ibis fast-paced modern day ol Internet technology
IMn sic al distance matters less and less as time goes on.
What's to stop us from (boosing a rival in Michigan or Iran?
Please, let's pick another rival, not one necessarily better,
But one that's similar to our school, so we two together
I 01111.1 rivalry as delic iouslv volatile as the uncertain weather.
"Come on," some will say, "Don't be ridiculous.
You can't treat something tun as it it is serious.
The rivalry that exists between Stanlord and Berkeley
Is not to be considered as if it were murkily
Tied to the state in which each school exists;
It's just a tradition and, as such, the boundaries of reason
()ur honored tradition rightly resists!"
I must confess, the above argument does have a point.
But consider this first before you anoint
Me the grumpy old senior who takes every thing seriously
Why did I choose to express myself mysteriously
In a fashion cheaply-rhymed and only semi-poetic
II I wanted to he anything but vaguely frenetic?
()f course 1 admit that Big Came can Ik* fun.
I just wish that the next Big Came could be done
With a school I hat we all could agree
Does not carry the anticlimax of a loser's guarantee.
