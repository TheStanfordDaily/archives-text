Critics miss the point of Gaieties
Perusing The Daily on Monday, 1 was abso
lutely shocked to linda front-page article con
demning Gaieties ("(iaieties scene sparks contro
versy, protest").
I he article highlighted complaints by some
members of the American-Indian community re
garding a short segment in the play. "We were
having a good time until that scene," quoth one of
the protesters, previously overlooking the bla
tant. far more prominent jokes degrading Chris
tians, Jews, Asians, Germans, fraternities, men,
women, pre-meds, CS majors. Republicans,
hermaphrodites, homosexuals and Cal. To high
light a minor aspect that most people, including
myself, did not catch (watching it Wednesday) de
feats the entire point of Gaieties: to make fun of
everything.
Going to Gaieties, you know you are going to
get a hilarious show that is, above all else, over the
top. In the end, it is c ritic al of all, but should be of
fensive to none. The charge that the producer
and the writers are racist deeply offends me.
Being friends with both the producer and two of
the writers, I know that they are not racist and, in
deed, are both hyper-conscious al)out political
correctness. I can only wait fora stale, colorless,
boring and humorless show next year, as the writ
ers and producer will be living in fear of falsely

being branded with the scarlet R.

Gaieties staffer defends performance
I am dismayed and aggravated by the way in
which my thoughts about the Powwow table in
this year's Gaieties, and Gaieties in general, were
represented in Monday's article ("Gaieties scene
sparks controversy, protest").
I feel it necessary to provide the appropriate
context in which to consider the statement I
made. It is true that I believe that Gaieties is
meant to be silly and offensive, but this does not
mean that I condone racism. Rather, 1 do not be
lieve there is anything racist about any part of
Gaieties.
Gaieties is a farce â€” it consistently mocks
groups of all sorts and does so in a systematic and
deliberately absurd way, so as to make it clear that
none of the jokes made at any group's expense
are to be taken seriously. It does not single out
any group as the sole focus of its humor, nor is
any group immune.
In addition to Native Americans, this year's
production makes fun of Indian people, Asian
people, German people, gay people, Christian
people and fraternities and sororities, to name a

few, in addition to containing a scene that, if some
one wished to, they could argue exploits and de
means women. 1 his is not because the writers of
Gaieties are racist, homophobic or sexist, and it
would be ludicrous to say so.
It is to be expected that certain individuals or
groups will find parts of Gaieties offensive, and I
fully support anyone's right to take offense. I do
not believe, however, that a group of people who
are put oil by some part of Gaieties, or any per
formance, have the right to keep anyone else
from being entertained by it. So long as Gaieties
is not espousing or proliferating racism, which I
absolutely do not think it is, then it is unjust to
censor its content merely because certain people
find it offensive.
In response to the accusation that the scene
would have been more acceptable had a Native
American woman been playing the role, I'm cer
tain that one would have been chosen had any
Native American person auditioned. Gaieties,
and Ram s Head I heatrical Society as a whole,
make a tremendous effort to recruit people of all
ethnicities and backgrounds, and this year's cast
was 35 percent minority as a result.
I am furthermore surprised and dismayed by
the implication that characters of a certain eth
nicity
