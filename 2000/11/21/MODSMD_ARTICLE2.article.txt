### NICOLE LOUIE 
As Stanford students made
their Thanksgiving plans last
week, campus organizations re
minded them to think of those
less loriunate. The impetus for
ihis reminder was National
Hunger and Homelessness
Awareness Week.
This year marked the first
time in several years that the
weeklong event was observed on
campus.
"Issues of hunger and home
lessness are especially relevant
to Stanford . . . due to our loca
tion. Silicon Valley is now one of
the most expensive places to live
in the world, if not the most ex
pensive," said junior Irene Hsu,
who was responsible for bring
ing the Week back to campus.
11 si i spent the summer work
ing with the (lommunity I lome
less Alliance Ministry in San
Jose, a grassroots non-profit or
ganization. Her experiences
there and in (lasses at Stanford
spurred her to organize a new
coalition. She contacted Night
()utrca< h, a group dedicated to
the homeless population ol Palo
Alto, Neged Ra'av, a sub-group
of the jewish studnet organiza

tion Hillcl and the Stanford
Project on Nutrition. Together
they worked to coordinate a
week of raising awareness and
getting help lor the hungry and
homeless.
l he nationwide Awareness
Week is celebrated during the
lii st full week Wore Thanksgiv
ing and is sponsored In the Na
tional Student Campaign
Against Hunger and Homeless
ness and the National Coalition
for the 1 fomeless.
Activities for the Week at
Stanford included a panel dis
cussion, a video screening, an in
terfaith panel and volunteer
work at local food banks. Night
Outreach published its first edi
tion of Street Forum, a newslet
ter addressing issues of home
lessness and hunger around
Stanford.
According to Dorcas Cheng,
a Night Outreach coordinator,
turnout for the week's opera
tions was excellent.
"We had awesome speakers,
and a lot of people who just
stopped to listen ended up slay
ing the whole time," said (ilieng,

student interest in the plight of people who are dependent on shelters.
( ation. "It got a lot <>l people realh
excited about the issues."
Avi Ka/a, co-public relations
coordinator lor Spoon, also said
that the events were fairly suc
cessful. "I had a lot ol people com
ing up to me saying, 'I'm realh
glad vou guvs are doing iliiv li s
reallv (hanged niv attitude,'
said Ka/a, a sophomore. He at
tributed the elfectiveness of the
events in part to speeches from
people living on the street, lie
said their stories sparked < ompas
sion in main ol the listeners.
According to members of the

spoils* >ring organizations, compas
sion isn'i enough. Ka/a s.iid there
was ,i good amount of I bod dona
lions. but c lothing donations were
small, and a relativelv sin,ill num
ber ol students volunteered at the
lood banks.
Though the events are over,
