I nderground"
Sometimes I get really bored. 1 don't
mean that I can't find any excitement in
m\ lilt* or that I can't derive any pleasure
or stimulation from what happens to me
on a daily basis. It's just that, occasionally,
when I sil down to think lor a while, I
come to ihc conclusion that everything
that's worth doing has been done already,
and everything else just isn'i worth doing,
beyond simple quests lor immediate grat
ification.
1 he frightening thing is that I see this

condition all around me in a lot o! my
peers, and I believe that n can have serious
repercussions. (Genuine boredom can lead
to dangerous depression, lor if nothing is
worth doing, then why even try to gel out
of bed in the morning?
No one can provide ;< definitive answer.
Bm you can find the will to go on looking
for one.
When human beings no longer have to
struggle to survive at a .subsistence level,
they have to come up with some other rea
son lor getting up and engaging in some
thing productive or interesting.
Whether it's striving lor an upper-mid
dle dass, married, while-pit ket-lence exis
tence or struggling to root out and destroy
injustice in I lie* world, or both, we plant
our feet in the ground and keep going.
But these rational goals aren't motivating
enough.
So we try to build our lives based on
some son of passion, whether it's for

making money, helping oihers or sleep
ing with as many people as possible.
Passions are irrational, emotional and
highly unstable, but without them our
constructed lives would crumble into
the dust.
Bui here comes the real problem.
Passions fade, or burn out. It's incredi
bly difficult lo maintain such irrational
and unstable foundations for living,
l'.very so often, when our passions are
at a low point, we stare at ourselves in
disbelief, thinking, "I'm not here, iliis
isn't happening," and wish desperately
that we could just completely disappear
fora while.
At iliis point, the real dangers of bore
dom start to arise, as we find ourselves at a
loss lor coming up with any rational or ir
rational motivations lor getting up in the
morning, and just lie in bed, staring at the
ceiling. Is there any way out of this trap,
iliis life-sucking stagnation thai can only

have one inevitable conclusion?
As Dostoevsky put it so well above,
awareness c an only result in inaction, as we
leali/e that, when you gel right down to it,
nothing that we do will make any kind of
difference in anything. Nor will we be ca
pable ol leeling happiness or contentment
for any extended period of time. Life is too
complex and chaotic to be contained by ra
tional actors, and human beings are too
unstable and emotional to achieve true
happiness.
We could try to esc ape, geographically
or chemically, and just refuse to think
about our boredom. That may work fora
while, but. like everything else, will ulti
mately lead to boredom again.
So what's the answer? Well, since the
lives that we construct for ourselves are the
only lives we've got,and since we can't con
struct them solely out of rational thought,
we have to try to live passionately.
l heonly way to find passion is to throw

yourself into life — to look and listen and
run around until you discover something
interesting, something that you can be
lieve in without any rational thought. If
you lose faith in that passion (and every
one loses faith), get up and throw yourself
out there again.
So, all you bored people, open your
eyes and step outside to discover all of the
interesting things to see and do all around
you.
A boy named Milo, who managed toes
tape fora time from his state of boredom,
said, "Well, I would like to make another
trip, but I really don't know when I'll have
the time. There's just so much to do right
here."
Life is short. Listen to Milo. Don't get
bored.
