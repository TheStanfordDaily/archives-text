AMES, lowa — It was hard not
to let the weather steal the show at
the NCAA Cross Country Cham
pionship in Ames.
When competitors toed the line
for the women's race at 11 a.m.,
temperatures had dipped into the
teens and gusis of snow brought
the wind chill down to a numbing
17-below zero.
From the sidelines, spectators
and reporters wondered aloud it
the (lalifornia-tanncd (Cardinal —
which entered the meet with the
No. 2 ranking — might be the
first to falter under the extreme
conditions.
Instead, the Stanford women's
performance was a testament to
the program's continued strength.
The Cardinal gutted out a gritty
third-place performance and put
two runners in the top 25.
"Regardless of conditions, re
gardless of circumstances, our kids
lend to come through," said head
coach Vin Lananna.
But the day belonged to the
Mountain Region, whose repre
sentatives barely missed a slep
over the frosty terrain of the lowa
State course. Colorado claimed
the team title over Brigham
Young, riding the first-place per
formance of senior Kara (irgas-
Wheeler to win the trophy with
117 points to the Cougars' lf>7.

Grgas-Wheeler ran away from the
pack in ilie final 1,000 meters to
win in 20 minutes, 30.5 seconds,
barely missing her own record
over the 0,000 meter course.
As the rest ol the racers came in,
Brigham Young was able pack
four women into the top 50 to
edge tlie Cardinal, and Stanford's
198 points brought home the
third-place trophy for the third
consecutive year.
For the Cardinal, sophomore
Lauren Fleshman c locked 20:54.5
to finish 11th in the 252-woman
field. Classmate Erin Sullivan fol
lowed in 21:18.9, placing 25th
overall. Both Fleslunan and Sulli
van drew on their experiences at
last year's NCAA meet — where
Fleshman finished fifth and Sulli
van seventh — to pace the Stan
lord squad throughout the race.
According to senior captain
Elena Villarreal, the team got out
toa good start, with Fleshman and
Sullivan gunning lor a pack ol
early front runners that included
defending champion Erica Palmer
and Bethanv Brewster of Wiscon
sin, in addition to (ii gas-Wheeler.
Ihe Cardinal had hoped to
keep a light pack of runners near
the front, but when Fleshman and
Sullivan slowly broke away, Villar
