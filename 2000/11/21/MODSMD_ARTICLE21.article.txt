## Women battle elements, take 3rd WXC 
### BECKY BLANCHARD EDITORIAL STAFF 
AMES, lowa — It was hard not
to let the weather steal the show at
the NCAA Cross Country Cham
pionship in Ames.
When competitors toed the line
for the women's race at 11 a.m.,
temperatures had dipped into the
teens and gusis of snow brought
the wind chill down to a numbing
17-below zero.
From the sidelines, spectators
and reporters wondered aloud it
the (lalifornia-tanncd (Cardinal —
which entered the meet with the
No. 2 ranking — might be the
first to falter under the extreme
conditions.
Instead, the Stanford women's
performance was a testament to
the program's continued strength.
The Cardinal gutted out a gritty
third-place performance and put
two runners in the top 25.
"Regardless of conditions, re
gardless of circumstances, our kids
lend to come through," said head
coach Vin Lananna.
But the day belonged to the
Mountain Region, whose repre
sentatives barely missed a slep
over the frosty terrain of the lowa
State course. Colorado claimed
the team title over Brigham
Young, riding the first-place per
formance of senior Kara (irgas-
Wheeler to win the trophy with
117 points to the Cougars' lf>7.

Grgas-Wheeler ran away from the
pack in ilie final 1,000 meters to
win in 20 minutes, 30.5 seconds,
barely missing her own record
over the 0,000 meter course.
As the rest ol the racers came in,
Brigham Young was able pack
four women into the top 50 to
edge tlie Cardinal, and Stanford's
198 points brought home the
third-place trophy for the third
consecutive year.
For the Cardinal, sophomore
Lauren Fleshman c locked 20:54.5
to finish 11th in the 252-woman
field. Classmate Erin Sullivan fol
lowed in 21:18.9, placing 25th
overall. Both Fleslunan and Sulli
van drew on their experiences at
last year's NCAA meet — where
Fleshman finished fifth and Sulli
van seventh — to pace the Stan
lord squad throughout the race.
According to senior captain
Elena Villarreal, the team got out
toa good start, with Fleshman and
Sullivan gunning lor a pack ol
early front runners that included
defending champion Erica Palmer
and Bethanv Brewster of Wiscon
sin, in addition to (ii gas-Wheeler.
Ihe Cardinal had hoped to
keep a light pack of runners near
the front, but when Fleshman and
Sullivan slowly broke away, Villar

Sophomore Lauren Fleshman led the way for the Stanford women, helping
the Cardinal finish third at the NCAAs with to her 11 th-place showing.
Stamps worked to make up for
time lost in the middle of the
pat k early in the race.
"I got stuck behind some real
1\ slow traffic at the beginning of
the race," Ettinger said. "The
whole race I was trying to fight
my way back up."
()n the back side of the course,
Fleshman and Sullivan made use
of the rolling hills and openings
in the pack to advance into the
top tenth of the field. As winds
ripped through the course, com
petitors began to tire, and the
field stratified even further as it
moved through the curves and
hills of the arboretum.
" I'lie tough part was staying
tough in the middle when the
wind was ballooning over you,"
Sullivan said. "It was a lough race
if you didn't have anyone to draft
off of."
Sullivan, who missed theWest
ern Regional race on Nov. 1 1
with a pulled hamstring, was able
to keep contact with fleshman
until the final 400 meters, when
fleshman pulled away.
"I felt like I was in good posi
i ion. I'd been planning it
throughout the race," Fleshman
said. "I think, had it been a little
warmer, my legs would have
been a little happier about pass
ing a few more people. But it was
so freezing cold out there and my
legs were pretty much numb, so I
just did the best I could."
Villarreal, who struggled to
find a kit kin the paralyzing cold,
held her own on the home
stretch, finishing 58th overall as
the third Cardinal into the
chutes. Her time, 21:37.0, was
nearly identical to her perfor
mance at the Pre-NCAA meet
held on the lowa State course on
Oct. 14 in much more pleasant
conditions.
Stamps, competing in only her
second rat e this season after de

billing in the West Regional, led
Ettinger onto the homestretch
and edged her way past oppo
nents in her final finish in a Car
dinal cross country uniform. 1 ler
88th place overall finish (21:54.5)
may not compare to past perfor
mances, but it provided crucial
points for Stanford.
"When 1 was out there racing,
the only thing I could think of is
that every single person I pass is
for someone on my team,"
Stamps said. "There wasn't really
any individual performance I
was looking to try to achieve. I
didn't think I could top off any of
my performances of past years."
According to Lananna, there
was never a doubt that Stamps,
though untested this season,
should be in the lineup at the
NCAA meet.
"When Julia Stamps lines up,
she gives you 100 percent,"
Lananna said. "She has been try
ing to put herself in a position to
help the team all year."
Ettinger rounded out Stan
ford's top five scorers, finishing
06th overall (21:57.2).
A duo of Cardinal freshman
followed in the sixth and seventh
positions for the Cardinal. Fresh
man Jillian Mastroianni looked
strong in her NCAA champi
onship debut, finishing in 1 15th
place (22:06.2). Classmate Victo
ria Chang fell back early, lighting
hard in the gusty conditions to
place 217 th (23:14.5).
While the Cardinal's bid for
the title fell short, its tough per
formance in lowa's extreme
weather, and the third-place tro
pin put a sweet cap on another
successful season for the Stanford
program.
"Overall, I think you go into a
race like this with a lot of heart, a
lot of determination, a lot of
toughness. Our athletes all the
way around really exhibited
that," Lananna said. "They ran
tough, they ran competitively,
and 1 think we've certainly laid
the foundation for great stuff in
the future."
