# St. Clair's shooting leads Card over Santa Clara
## 
### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
It was home sweet home for the Stanford
women's basketball team. After losing at St.
Mary's on Friday night, the Cardinal (1 -1) re
turned to the comfort of Maples Pavillion,
posting an 85-57 rout of Santa Clara last
night.
"Friday was a wake up call," said junior
Lauren St. Clair. "We realized that we were
playing Division I basketball and tlirit we had
to play more serious. At the very least we cor
rected many of Friday's mistakes and execut
ed much better tonight."
Emerging freshman Susan King, rebound
ing from a mediocre debut, paced the Cardi
nal with nine points and nine assists. After
Stanford's problems controlling the ball on
Friday, King's command of the offense trans
formed the team's presence on the court.
"I was more confident tonight." said King,
pointing to the help recently sidelined sopho

more Jamie Carey has given her in practice.
Reminiscent of last year and its opening
game, Stanford was slow out of the starting
gate, struggling to take, let alone make, many
field goals in the opening 10 minutes of play.
The teams battled back and forth, with the
Cardinal maintaining a slight lead, propelled
by consistent free throw shooting.
Throughout the first half the Cardinal
fought through streaky shooting and com
munication problems. But a tough man-to
man defense and some spectacular surges by
King and freshmen guard Nicole Powell sent
the team into the break with a comfortable 30-
23 lead.
In the second half, the Cardinal came out
running, powered by a quick seven points by
junior Bethany Donaphin, and seemed to fi
nally settle into its groove.
Leading the way for Santa ( lat a was senior
center Annie Carrison, who posted 15 points
and 15 rebounds, learning with her at the
post was the Bronco's Kendra Rhea, adding

to points, t lowever, me strong tnsiae piay ot
Santa Clara was not enough to overcome
Stanford's many offensive weapons.
Kvery player on the Cardinal roster netted
at least one basket, with St. Clair leading the
way, scoring all I 3 ol her points in the second
half. Junior forward hnjoli l/.idor added 12
points for Stanford.
"We've got a lot of depth." said St. Clair.
"()ne through 12 on our roster can all play. It
makes practice much more competitive."
Despite tonight's impressive performance,
questions remain for the Cardinal. Senior
center Carolyn Moos, who led the women in
scoring last season, has yet to make an impact
in the Cardinal rotation. She and 0-loot-7 ju
nior Cori Knghusen got only 20 minutes of
playing time combined in tonight's contest.
"We felt it would be advantageous to go
small." said head coach Lara VanDerveer.
"Carolyn will get better, but she's got a lot
more people knocking on her
door, so she'll have to compete for
her time."
Rebounding also remains a
