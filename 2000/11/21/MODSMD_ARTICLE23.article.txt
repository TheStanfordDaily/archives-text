### BEN ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
AMES, lowa — The Cardi
nal men escaped the biting cold
here yesterday with a fourth
place finish in the race of attri
tion that was the NCAA (Ihampi
onship.
While snows Hurries chopped
the temperature to 19 degrees
(with gusts that brought the wind
chill factor to 17 below), Stanford
endured 10 kilometers of pain to
produce two All-Americans, se
nior co-captains Jonathon Riley
and Thomas Murley.
The Cardinal scored 149
points, behind 8S for winner
Arkansas, 94 for Colorado and
121 lor Providence College. Thir
ty-one teams participated.
"Whenever you have a race
with those kinds of conditions, it's
really a crapshoot as to what is

going to happen," said Stanford
head coach Vin Lananna. "We ac
tually had very good perfor
mances— we put six runners in
the top ()0, which is what we
thought we needed to do."
But the Cardinal's strategy —
to run aggressiveh near the front
at as conservative pace as possible
for the first live kilometers — was
not unique.
"Everyone had the same idea,"
Lananna said. "Arkansas ran ex
actly how we wanted to — they
put their top live among the top SO
early in the race."
With the- weather threatening
to punish the leader, the pack of
255 runners was clumped from
the gun. A relatively pedestrian
first mile of live minutes kept the
group tight, with nearly disastrous
results.

In his final cross country meet for Stanford, senior Jonathon Riley turned in an
impressive performance, finishing 10th in at the NCAA Championship.
)usi alter the nuk', the course
emerged from <i wooded area and
look a 90-degree bend l)«n k toward
the start. llie leaders, however,
didn't see the course markings and
continued straight ahead.
"A lot of people had to double
hat k," Riley said. " I here was a lot
ol commotion and .1 coupleol guvs
went down.
"The whole rate turnetl into
sort ol .1 fren/v. Murley atldetl.
A On couldn't relax while everyone
was jostling for position."
Pulling an end i<> the lagging
pace, (leorgetown freshman
Franklvn Sant he/ stole the leati at

the three-kilometer mark and
pushed to stratify the rat e.
Rilev and Murley stayed with the
pack ol l'> who went with him, l>ui
retlshiri lreshinan Konis Luchini,
freshmen Donald Sage and l.m
Dohson and sophomore Seth
llejn\ were mired nearly 40 spots
hack. Sophomore Andy Powell,
(ailed on to replace injured redshirt
freshman (.Irani Rohison, was
si niggling even farther behind with
.1 nagging Achilles tendt)ii injury.
"When the race broke at three
kilometers, the pat e got away from
us," Lananna said. " We weren't
awake and we didn't move."
Up front, Riley and Murley
looketl lor opportunities to catch
the leaders, but tame up with ver\
little.
"Because of the conditions, it

wasn't like one could get out there
and make a decisive move — you
would (usi gel pushed back," Mlll
- said. "You had it) make gradual
headway into the wind."
After wait lung the pate lag lor
the next lew kilometers, defending
champion l).i\ul Rimani of Alaba
ma made his bit I lor a repeat with
three kilometers to go, grinding
away those who narrowl\ dung to
the lead pack. Riley and Murley
were left to battle the remaining
stretch from behind. I hey kept in
contact, each making sure that he
knew where the oilier stood.
Bui with Arkansas charging
near the lead and ('.olorado sneak
ing up from behind, ii w;ls nearly
impossible to discern htm the Irani
race was developing.
"Ii ultimateh turnetl into a

strength rat e sniietl to the toughest
guys out there," Murlev s«tid.
I lie weather look its iinal toll in
the finishing stretch, as Riley tried
i<> power home.
" 1 lie finish is where I usually try
to (at( 11 people and he a little hit
tougher than everybody else,"
Rile\ said. "I tried to go there, hut I
just couldn't make any ground be
cause of the wind."
Riley ( tossed as Stanford's top
finisher in l()th plate, clocking 30
minutes, 40.(i seconds for his
loin ill-straight All-American per
formance.
"Il\ tlie time I got to the finish, I
realized how cold 1 was — my legs
were lurch working and inv lace
hurt," Riley said.
\i i he finish, it was Arkansas, led
l>\ the Nth-place finish <>l James

Raranu, that pat keel its five scorers
inside a 20-second spread for the
victory. Colorado placed all five
scorers in the top 44 for second,
and Providence rode the individ
ual win of Keith Kelly (30:14.5) —
who overtook. Kiinani and others
in the finishing stretch — to third.
Mnrley crossed in 30:55.4 lor
22nd, and Sage pushed in lor 48th
in 31:18.6.
"The race was definitely as
tough as everyone said it would
be," Sage said. "Louie [Luchini]
and I tried to work together, which
definitely helped until 1 lost him at
eight kilometers."
Luchini had fallen just a few
spots back, finishing 53rd in
31:10.3. I lejny capped the scoring
for Stanford at 59th place
(31:23.8), and Dobson was 78tli at

31:33.7.
"With the pacing and conditions
of the race, Luchini, Sage and Dob
son had to make adjustments,
which is tough to do when you've
never been in a NCAA Champi
onship race before," Lananna said.
"You've got no vantage point."
And though the adjustments
they did make were not quite
enough to propel Stanford to the
victory stand, bright spots emerged
from the cold gray of Ames.
"Looking at Jonathon's consis
tency as a four-time All-American,
lie is just a money man all the way,"
Lananna said. "And Thomas has
steadily and systematically per
formed well.
" Those guys should be excited
about what they've done lbr our
program."
