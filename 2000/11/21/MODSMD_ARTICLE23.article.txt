AMES, lowa — The Cardi
nal men escaped the biting cold
here yesterday with a fourth
place finish in the race of attri
tion that was the NCAA (Ihampi
onship.
While snows Hurries chopped
the temperature to 19 degrees
(with gusts that brought the wind
chill factor to 17 below), Stanford
endured 10 kilometers of pain to
produce two All-Americans, se
nior co-captains Jonathon Riley
and Thomas Murley.
The Cardinal scored 149
points, behind 8S for winner
Arkansas, 94 for Colorado and
121 lor Providence College. Thir
ty-one teams participated.
"Whenever you have a race
with those kinds of conditions, it's
really a crapshoot as to what is

going to happen," said Stanford
head coach Vin Lananna. "We ac
tually had very good perfor
mances— we put six runners in
the top ()0, which is what we
thought we needed to do."
But the Cardinal's strategy —
to run aggressiveh near the front
at as conservative pace as possible
for the first live kilometers — was
not unique.
"Everyone had the same idea,"
Lananna said. "Arkansas ran ex
actly how we wanted to — they
put their top live among the top SO
early in the race."
With the- weather threatening
to punish the leader, the pack of
255 runners was clumped from
the gun. A relatively pedestrian
first mile of live minutes kept the
group tight, with nearly disastrous
results.
