# Odds and ends from Big Game...
## 
### 
Rummaging through the Big Game files, a
few bits and pieces stand out: — I've said it
before, and I'll say it again: Nothing makes
your defense look like the 1974 Pittsburgh
Steelers like playing California.
— Best moment of the game: Luke Powell showing
off dancin' feet that would do Savion C ilover proud by
staying inbounds en route to his 75-yard touchdown.
— Close runner-up: Willie Howard's first career in
terception and rumbling, bumbling, stumbling I 7-

yard return. I was half expecting
Tyrone to put him in at fullback in
overtime after that display of ball
carrying prowess.
— Honorable mention: Casey
Moore, all by his lonesome in the
end zone.
— Best news of the following day:
Cal athletic director John Kasser,
reaffirming his support for Beats
head coach Tom I iolmoe (now 0-4
in Big Games).

"Tom's going to be here as long as he wants to,
Kasser said. "I will protect the university against it sell
in this regard."
Amen, John. 1 lell, we'll pay his salary.
— In theory,l approve of the lack of fights, goalpost
tearing, turf-throwing, etc. after this year s battle. In
practice, though, the whole thing felt a little . .. sani
tized. Cal fans too dejected to riot? Its not a sight I
thought I'd ever see.
— I feel as though the Memorial Stadium announcer
may have missed a calling as an NPL Films narrator.
I he phrase "The reception and subsequent advance
brings the ball to the 17-yard line looks natural on
paper, but say it over a P.A. to a crowd of 07,500 and

it sounds about as unforced and breezy as Al Gore
performing I lamlet.
— I \ rone YVillingham, never one to miss an opportu
nity to think big, wasn't afraid in his post game speech
to the players to suggest a national championship
might be a reasonable goal in the next couple years.
— There are those that would argue this Big Game ri
valry is not as dose as some make it out to be. C Consid
er that the last time Stanford lost as many as three in
a row to the Bears was 1958-1900 (which was followed
by Stanford's other six-game win streak), and the last
time Stanford lost five in a row to Cal was 1919-1923.
— Another thing: Stanford in the last 20 years against
Cal is 14-5-1. Put those numbers up in the NFL and
they'll accuse you of playing a mighty soft schedule.
— Russell Stewart's now-legendary "Cal is poo"
speech .it the Bonfire Rally Thursday night may not
go down in history alongside "Win one for the Gip
per," but it damn well should.
— Funniest sideline moment of the game: At least
three I niversity of (California police officers posing to
take a picture of themselves with the Tree.
— Least impressive impressive-sounding statistic: the
fact that this was the first Big Game ever to go to over
time. Sounds good until one remembers that the
NCAA instituted overtime in college football in 1990.
— Watching a game like this makes you wonder why
the NCAA waited so long to institute overtime. Can
you imagine the reaction from the crowd if that game
had ended in 30-30 tie?
— Finally, I think it's not too early to place bets for
next year's Big Game. You heard it here first: Stan
ford 35, ('al 31.

I)'U Cooper, a senior, will iluinl "Cal is ftoo" nt every liig
Came from now until he dies.
