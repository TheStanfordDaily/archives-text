# A 						volleyball lifer says goodbye
## 
### LINDSAY KAGAWA 
I ihtiii \ \'ote: l.mdsa\ Kagawa is a senior outside hitter for
the Stanford women's volleylmll team. She will be Jrl/iying
her linal regular-season Mime at Mables Pavilion tonight.

Breaking up is hard to do.
Stanford Volleyball and I have been together for
four Neat's and tonight, we're sa\ing goodbye.

It began the way so many affairs
do — a c rush developing from alar.
Some girls had New Kids
posters plastered around their
rooms. Hut those were also the
gills with their own phone lines
and lipstick privileges. As for me —
don't think I didn't roc k the ham
mer pants, rayon shirts and match
ing sc rum hies and socks. ()li no. I

had a spiral perm 100. But my alter ego was quickly
developing and m\ walls were lined with dreamy im
ages neath lifted from Volleyball Magazine.
"The I earn of the Nineties" quickly took control ol
mv bedroom. I was glued to the set for the 1992 na
tional championship, and when Stanford took the
reins from I ('.LA as the reigning national power
bouse I was hooked. Stanford became my obsession
and m\ goal was ollic ially set. I was going to be wear
ing cardinal in 1997.
Fast-forward live vears and there I was, standing
on the endline in Spokane, Wash., the 1997 national
championship on the line against IVnn State. And
guess who was wearing cardinal.
It was onlv yesterday, I swear, that one of our
coaches told me that ibis was all going to go by so fast.
I hat vesterda\. funnv enough, was sophomore year.
Bui since that vesterdax I've definitely aged.
Kvervthing is a little bit clearer now. The defense
comes as eas\ as breathing; the offensive signals come
like please and thank you. The scouting reports make
sense, individual meetings are a lit tie less scary, and I
might as well get mv mail sent lo the training room.

Volleyball and I have grown close. For four years
now we had to coordinate our schedules—we've
bad to party less, sleep more and study when we can.
We've been inseparable, to say the least.
But tonight the signal for thai change is going to
come loud and clear. I he last home match. Maples
Pavilion one last lime. Super Fan in his red shirt, the
kids with signs, ( litlord and his "Ciooo . . . Stanford!"
\l\ grandparents in the same seats, the gum from my
mom, the wave from my dad, the encouragement of
coaches, the high lives from my teammates. I lic
hee. The Band. The rituals ol pregaine. lis all stulf
that until tonight I might not have noticed all at once,
but tonight I'm sure i will.
And I'm going to be a lancet.
Unfortunately though, it's something that all us
eventually have to do. For most of us without the
hopes of plaving professionally, our lasi games in car
dinal red mark will our mark out final days of com
petition. Sure, I'll play in adult leagues and alumni
games, but nothing will ever quite rival my experi
ence here at Stanford.
And I know for sure that I won't have I lie privi
lege of being surrounded by a group of more amaz
ing women than the ones whose faces I see every day
in the gym. li s ihem that I'm going lo miss the
most.
I shouldn't act like it's over, though. Indeed, my
final season has been a tumultuous one — one filled
with the kinds of peaks and valleys sports psycholo
gists love to use as blueprints lot diagrams. But come
on now — we haven't even started the tournament
yet. And I'm guessing that although we're not going to
be claiming a top seed ibis year, not too many teams
around the nation are begging tor us in their bracket.
dome tourney time the slate is clean and we're
going to be peaking. So, tonight, yeah, the tears are
going to be coming. Mv < areer here at Stanford as a
vollevball plaver and as a student has been a blessing
for wliich I'm eternally grateful. Bui as soon as that
whistle blows, mv snotty lace is going to be all busi
ness. We have a c hampionship to win before I'm re
ally clone.
