# Essay Web site targets Stanford
## Students accepting e-mail offers could violate Fundamental Standard 
### MARIKA KNOWLES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Papcrs4ljt\ss, an online company that sells stu
dent essays lor "research put poses," has solicited
a number of Stanford students in the past two
weeks, offering to market the students' essays on
their Web site.
"I don't think sellinga paper to one of these
companies would be an Honor (lode viola
tion," said Laurette Beeson, the judicial advi
sor at the Board of Judicial Allairs. "It would be
a rundamental Standard violation. Selling it to
another Stanford student would be an 1 fonor
( '.ode violation."
Students have received the oilers by e-mail, ac
companied by the subject heading: "Stanlbrd Stu
dents — (let ( '.ash lor Your Papers."
II the essays were used to aid plagiarism, then
the seller could beading in \ iolationofthc 1 lonor
Code, which states that "students will not give or
receive unpermitted aid in class work."
Two-thirds oft he history papers offered on the
site are attributed to Stanford students, and many
other subjects also contain papers from Stanford.

Some students said thai they were flattered at
the otter, but questioned its ethical implications.
"It is an ego boost to think that someone be
lieves your work is good enough to deserve
money .. . but I'm not about to sell my work. It
doesn't seem quite ethical," said Ana Lombera,
a sophomore who received three e-mails from
Papers'■ I Less.
Most oi°those students who received the e-mail
do not know how the company found their names
or addresses.
l he site, www.Papers4Less.com, varies from
conventional web-based paper-selling sites like
School Sucks and Cheathouse, which openly
market the papers on their sites as material for
students looking to plagiarize.
According to the information available on the
site, the purpose of the PaperslLess site is to pro
vide for students ready-made research materials,
not documents to be submitted verbatim as the
buyer's work.
The site oilers to post students' descriptions of
their essays and to act free of charge as the mid
dleman between the writers of the essavs and the
students who wish to purchase them.
Before the instructions for the use of t lie site, a
reminder states that "papers on this site are for use
as reference (>nlv and are not lot >e si tbmitted 'as is'
— ibis is plagiarism and is forbidden."
1 lowever, some students and professors indi
cate that students use sites like Papers I Less for

purposes other than research.
An anonymous Writing and (Iritical 'Iliinking
ins! met or expressed disbelief at the prices asked
lor the papers, which range from % 1 to $28.
" That's a lot to ask lor research," the instructor
said.
According to the Stanford Bulletin, the Funda
mental Standard regulates behavior "lx»th within
and without the University."
Beeson said that the burden ol'proof would lie
with the board to determine ii the site was clearly
an aid to plagarism, and in that case, if a reason
able student could have recognized the nature of
the site.
The WC; i instructor expressed a different
opinion. "The disclaimer on the site is a fig-leaf,
and I think the I niversity would take it as a lig
leaf," he said.
Steve Hansen, security ollicer with Infbrma
tion Technology Systems and Services, has re
ceived complaints from a numlxr of the students
receiving the Papers llx'ss e-mails.
1 fansen said that the list was most likely com
piled through a search of student Web pages, on
which students often place their e-mail addresses.
Hansen said that Computer Security would
treat the case like any other spam — the bulk
sending of unsolicited commercial e-mail.
"If you complain, we will say stop it. If they do
ii again, we consider that harassment, so we'll
block them," I lansen said.
