# Zapata murals:
## Images of activism 
### VLADA TEPER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
()rlando doesn't live in (lasa
Zapata. But that hasn't kept the
sophomore from noticing the
dorm's most distinguishing—and
controversial — leal lire: the more
than 20 brightly colored murals lo
cated in or near the (ihicano theme
dorm, including two massive paint
ings in Stern Dining 1 fall.
"I would go and eat dinner there
sometimes to simply Ix* around the
murals and to look at them,''
said.
The murals are the products of
political ac tivism movements of the
1970s and 19905. In the 19705, ilit*
(Ihicano movement swepl the na
tion and the Bay Area played a
major role.

"Students fought to establish
(lasa Zapata at that time," said Zapa
ta theme associate Gabriella Rico, a
sophomore. When the house was
constructed, Zarco Guerrero, a fa
mous muralist from Mesa, Ariz., was
commissioned to give ii its cultural
flavor.
Ten years later, poet and artist
Jose Antonio Burciaga became the
Resident Fellow of the house. Start
ing Stanford Workshops on Political
and Social Issues, Burciaga taught
mural classes that culminated in the
murals.
"Political ac tivism has been a pri
mary reason for main of the murals
around the house and in the dining
hall, but the\ also portray cultural
pride and the rewriting of history

This mural from Casa Zapata is a response to the media's portrayal of Latina
women. This and other murals illustrate the history and heritage of the Stan
ford Chicano / Latino community.

said.
Senior Alvaro Soria saw the

cano Stanford community around

I like the lad that not all those
people are ( hicano," Soria said. "It
is very inclusive, containing not

I lie most controversial mural is

lilt' 11)74 CJuerrero mural, "A Reac
tion lo Violence and Institutional
Racism in the Media, on the right
liand side entrance to Stein Dining
Hall.
I he painting portrays a young
Mestizo woman on the It'll, <i faceless
blonde-haired head in the middle
and an aged Mestizo woman on the
right-hand side with red paint drip
ping like blood Ironi the top ol the
mural. I his work is olten misread
<ind misunderstootl, according to
Rm (>.
"In the early 191H)s the painting
was defaced and a lace added to the
blond woman with the writing 'Not

.ill white people are oppressors, "
s,iid Rico. " I lie mural, however, ad
dresses more the portrayal of the
Mexican woman as a skinny white
blond on Mexican television."
A plaque next to the mural,
added later by Burciaga, reads,
" I lie mural portrays the Indian
side ol Mexicans and Chicanos
without pretense or regrets."
According to Rico, when (iuer
rero was asked what he thought
about the defacement of his mural,
he replied, "Murals are painted to
have an interaction with the audi
ence. That is what it is there lor."
Other than the controversial

portrayal of history and (.hicano/
Latino identity, the murals also
represent cultural tradition.
"Murals are a staple of the lati
no and ('.hicano cultures," said
freshman Stephanie Seltner.
In a report lor Spanish ( lass on
the Burciaga supper mural, "The
History and Mythology of Mai/.,"
Selmer learned about Mayan
mythology, including the creation
myth.
"The mural portrays the cre
ation of man from corn," said
Selmer.
Lara showed the murals to chil
dren from East Palo Alto who were

on-campus through the Barrio As
sistance service program.
"It was good to take kids there
because [the murals] are a visual
representation of tlie C'.hicano and
latino culture and history," said
Lara.
Zapata and its theme associates
give mural tours many times
throughout the year.
Burciaga, who passed away in
1995, will always be remembered
through his contribution, Rico
said.
"This is what the people lived
for,"he said. "Burciaga's life's
blood is in these murals."
