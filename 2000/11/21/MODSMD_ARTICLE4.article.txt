()rlando doesn't live in (lasa
Zapata. But that hasn't kept the
sophomore from noticing the
dorm's most distinguishing—and
controversial — leal lire: the more
than 20 brightly colored murals lo
cated in or near the (ihicano theme
dorm, including two massive paint
ings in Stern Dining 1 fall.
"I would go and eat dinner there
sometimes to simply Ix* around the
murals and to look at them,''
said.
The murals are the products of
political ac tivism movements of the
1970s and 19905. In the 19705, ilit*
(Ihicano movement swepl the na
tion and the Bay Area played a
major role.

"Students fought to establish
(lasa Zapata at that time," said Zapa
ta theme associate Gabriella Rico, a
sophomore. When the house was
constructed, Zarco Guerrero, a fa
mous muralist from Mesa, Ariz., was
commissioned to give ii its cultural
flavor.
Ten years later, poet and artist
Jose Antonio Burciaga became the
Resident Fellow of the house. Start
ing Stanford Workshops on Political
and Social Issues, Burciaga taught
mural classes that culminated in the
murals.
"Political ac tivism has been a pri
mary reason for main of the murals
around the house and in the dining
hall, but the\ also portray cultural
pride and the rewriting of history
