Stalled by more than 30 trained volunteers and oper
ating 24 hours a day, the Bridge oilers a much needed
emotional outlet lor many Stanford students. W illi three

full-lime, live-in student counselors,
there is always s< >me<>ne at 1 1 le Bridge

Bonogofsky, a senior, is one of the
live-in stallmemlxTs at the Bridge.
"People think that 110 one at Stan
lord has problems," she said. "But it's
dangerous lor students not to ex-

press their frustration."
Students suffering I bom a wide range of crises can take
advantage of the center's services. The Bridge receives
( alls concerning everything from suicide and depression
to stress and ( heating.
()ne ol the attractions of the Bridge lies in its policy of
complete anonymity — neither the caller nor the coun
selor gives their names.
"During the calls, we never give out advice. Rather, we
help people solve their own problems by helping them
discover the root of their troubles," said stallinemlierAde

line A/rack, a junior.
The Bridge training includes the "eight command
ments" of peer counseling. These Bridge laws forbid
counselors from giving advice or interpreting the feelings
of those-? seeking help. By refraining from judgments,
counselors hope to help people going through problems
reach new understandings of'themselves.
The stall members line! the Bridge to he a re
warding experience.

"()neof the Ik'si thingsabout
the Bridge is the incredible sense of
community we have here," Bonogof
sky said.
Tai Lockspeiser, a senior
and the oldest undergraduate
staffer, also praised the camaraderie
at the center.
"It serves to create a social net-

work of extremely eating and supportive individuals,
which is nice because then we support each oilier as well
as the Stanford community," L(x kspeiser said.
I Ins close network promotes the sharing of new skills
and provides the staff with much-needed suppon as it
helps others solve t heir problems. Although the lime com
mitment is demanding, it leaches skills that the staff can
draw 011 later in life.
/\zrack described how her experience as a Bridge

counsel* >rhas.e\tended into her per
sonal life.
"I (eel that now I have the ability to
realh interpret in\ own feelings. I've
liecn able lo use what I've learned by
applving ii lo m\ relationships with
m\ friends and fitmilv," she said.
A/ra* k said she believes the Bridge's
counselor-training program has
Ik-cii the niosi valuable (lass she's
taken at Stanford.
Lo( kspeiser agreed. "1
learned what n was like to wake
up at 1 a.m. to provide support to
a peer with no one to turn to," she
said. "I learned how to handle se

rious issues such as suicide and
depression. I learned how to be a
leader and how to teach."
In order to be a staff member,
interested students need to take
Education 193A, "Peer Counsel
ing: Bridge Community," a two
unit dass ottered every quarter.
New counselors are selected from
the class based on their knowl
edge of the material. Selection to
the Bridge staff is not guaranteed
after taking the class.
"You can't just read the mate
rial and expect to be a good coun
selor. It's not like reading a
recipe," A/rack said.
()nce selected, each staff'mem
ber must commit to a minimum of
three hours per week and one
weekend per quarter. For their in

volvement, cat li member gets one
unit ofcredit.
The Bridge has seen many
changes since its inception. Found
ed in 1971 by Vincent IVAndrea,
the program began as a student
run drug-counseling center. Since
then it has broadened its scope and
become a more inclusive support
center lor Stanford and the sur
rounding area. The Bridge otters
services not just to students, but to
the surrounding community.
Next year, the Bridge will
change buildings from its current
location at 5(>3 Salvatierra Walk
to a more spacious building up
the street at Roger's House. The
move will be compete in time for
the center's 'Wth anniversary in
September.
