MM between Aspirin and
Advil? Americans manage 90%
of their health problems
themselves, and six out of ten
medicines bought are over-the
counter. 1 lere's some informa
tion about them, and prescrip
tion medications as well.
Over-the-Counter
Drugs
Try to select over-the-counter
medications that have only the
ingredients you need (multi
symptom drugs may give you
medicine for problems you
don't have). And don't misuse
non-prescription medicines by
taking them longer or in higher
doses than the label recommends.
Pain Relievers
Pain relievers include Aspirin,
Advil, Tylenol, and Aleve.
Which one to use? They all
relieve pain and reduce fever.
All but Tylenol reduce inflam
mation. Here are more distinc
tive attributes:
ASPIRIN is the oldest and
least expensive pain reliever.
Although it is common, aspirin
is powerful. It can cause upset
stomach, nausea, and mild
gastrointestinal bleeding
(buffered compounds may
diminish these side effects).
Aspirin can interfere with
blood clotting, lead to
increased bleeding, and is not
recommended if you have

asthma. If you take aspirin for
a hangover, it may increase the
risk of stomach irritation.
TYLENOL (acetaminophen) is
like aspirin in its pain-relieving
and fever-lowering qualities, but
it doesn't reduce inflammation.
It has almost no adverse effects
on the stomach. Taking exces
sive acetaminophen in conjun
ction with alcohol can lead to
liver damage.
ADVIL (ibuprofen) and Aleve
(naproxen) are generally gentler
on the stomach than aspirin. But
they can still cause indigestion,
nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain,
and ulcers, and should always
be taken with food.
Prescription
Medications
To get the most from a
prescription:
■ Tell your health care
practitioner about any over
the-counter medications,
vitamins or herbal supple
ments that you are taking
Ask what foods, drinks,
activities, or other medica
tions to avoid while taking
the medication
Ask what "take as needed"
Ask for generic medications
(they are chemically
equivalent to the name
brands, but are less expensive)
Read the label at the
pharmacy to be sure there
are no mistakes
Fill prescriptions at the same
pharmacy, and tell the
pharmacist what other non
prescription and prescription
drugs you are taking so they
don't interact negatively
Don't take another person's
medication, or give yours to
others
Generally, it's important to take
medications at the same time
each day
Know when to take each
dose (e.g., find out if "four
times a day" means just
during the day or around the
clock)
Ask what to do when you
forget to take a dose (it is
different for different
medications)
Don't stop taking antibiotics
because you "feel better"
(the entire prescription must
be used to completely clear
the infection)
Plan ahead so your treatment
will be uninterrupted - get
refills well before you run out
