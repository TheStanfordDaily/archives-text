I S. Kmbassy in Moscow, where despite
strong American protests the radiation con
tinues, though ;it reduced levels.
"Ip to now, the view most widely accept

sophisticated I .S. electronic intelligence
gathering equipment at l lie embassy. . . .

the microwaves are simply pari of the nor
mal bat kground radiation found in any
major city."
