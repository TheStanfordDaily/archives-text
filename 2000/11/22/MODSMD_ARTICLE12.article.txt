Forty-nine portable computers were
reported stolen at MIT last year, giv
ing it the top spot in a survey of col
leges and universities conducted by
Canton-based lockmaker Kryptonite
Corp.
Kryptonite's survey wasn't the most
precise. It says MIT reported it had 50
laptops stolen last year, and assigned
Stanford University second place for
reporting that "40 to 50" laptops
were stolen in 1999. Georgetown Uni
versity was ranked third with "35 to
50" reported missing, Kryptonite
spokeswoman Donna Tocci said.
Tocci said the company contacted
campus-security officers at hundreds
of the country's largest colleges and
universities, though she wouldn't say
exactly how many it called or, of those,
how many responded.
