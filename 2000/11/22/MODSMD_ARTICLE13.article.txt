## China curbs missile sales 
### 
BFIJING (AP) — China promised yes
terday not to sell missiles or components to
countries developing nuclear weapons,
easing tensions with Washington over
long-suspected Chinese assistance to Pak
istan. Iran and North Korea.
A statement, released In the Chinese
Foreign Ministry, was (Ihina's most explic
it pledge to date on refraining from
spreading missile technology. Ii covered
not onlv whole missile svstems, which Bei
jing agreed not to transfer two years ago,
but also dual-use components that could
be used in other technologies.
"China li.is no intention to assist, in
any way, any country in the development
of ballistic missiles that can be used to de
liver nuclear weapons," Foreign Ministry
spokesman Sun Ynxi said in the state
ment carried In the oflic ial Xinhua News
Agency.
Sun said that China will improve con
trols to stop unlicensed transfers of mis
sile technology and — for the first time —
publish <i comprehensive list of "missile
related items and dual-use items" whose
export will be restricted.
For countries developing nuclear-capa
ble missiles, "China will exercise special
scrutiny and caution, even lor items not
specifically contained on the control list."
Sun said. He added that before issuing ex
port licenses. (Ihina will consider whether an
item could be diverted to missile programs.
Although Sun did not mention specific
countries, Washington has suspected
China of aiding the missile programs ol
Pakistan, Iran and North Korea since the
early l ( .) ( .)()s and has in the past imposed
sanctions on C Chinese companies.
In response to China's statement, the
U.S. State Department announced it
would forgo imposing sanctions on Chi
nese companies previously involved in
spreading the dangerous technologies and
would begin processing licenses for com
mercial space cooperation, including the
launching of U.S. satellites by China.
"This development can strengthen co
operation between the United States and
(.'•lijtja to achieve 0111 common <>bje< live ol
preventing the spread of ballistic missiles
that threaten regional and international
security," State Department spokesman
Ric hard Bouc her said in Washington.

China's pledge and Washington's fa
vorable response c apped years of negotia
tions that quickened since they resumed in
| ulv following a 14-month suspension by
Beijing in anger over the U.S. bombing of
the Chinese Finbassy in Yugoslavia.
Boucher said negotiators met again ear
lier this month in Beijing and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright discussed prolif
eration with Chinese officials at List week's
meeting of Pacific Rim economies in
Brunei.
"This is ( hina's clearest and most com
plete statement on missile proliferation,"
said Phillip Saunders, an expert on Chi
nese nuclear weapons transfers at the
Monterey Institute of International Stud
ies. "II there are loopholes, it's not evi
dent."
Since the mid-19905, the Clinton ad
ministration has tried to persuade Beijing
to bolster arms controls and join interna
tional agreements while living to avoid
punishing China with broad sanctions th.it
could undermine ties.
China has responded positively, pro
gressiveh committing to broader and
more specific controls, Saunders said,
adding that while Beijing's "record has not
been perfect, it has improved."
Fvidence has grown about Beijing's
transfers of missile technology. An intelli
gence finding last year determined that
China transferred nuclear-capable M-1 1
missiles to Pakistan in the early 19905. A
( IA report in August said unspecified Chi
nese assistance to Pakistan continued in
1999. flie report also found that Chinese
fu ins provided missile-related items, raw
materials and other assistance to Iran,
North Korea and Libya.
China has publicly denied ever trans
ferring missiles or related technologies to
foreign countries. After Pakistan and
India traded nuclear test explosions in
1995, Beijing showed renewed interest in
controlling the spread of missiles.
At a Beijing summit with President
Clinton later that year, Chinese President
|iang Zemin agreed to abide by, but not
sign, the Missile lechnology Control
Regime — a 13-year-old agreement
signed by 32 countries that restricts trans
fers of missiles capable of delivering nucle
ar weapons.
