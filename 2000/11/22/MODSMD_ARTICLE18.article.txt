## The 						Stanford Daily Giving thanks for a cross-cultural American link 
### 
Religion is a scary word in
modern America. Thankfully,
Thanksgiving is not. Recent years
have seen diminished public cele
brations of religious holidays, most notably in
our public school systems, due to a perception
that celebrating one holiday disadvantages in
dividuals of other faith traditions, life philoso
phies or cultural descent.
Stanford University does not endorse cele
brations of such holidays as Rosh Hashanah,
Dia de los Muertos, Ramadan and Easter. The
University does support student groups that
provide services and celebratory events for
these holidays, but only as a detached super
visory entity.
Thanksgiving, on the other hand, is the
one holiday that many diverse people across
Stanford and America celebrate. And we do

so emphatically: Thanksgiving is the most
crowded travel time of the year. At no other
time do as many people fly 3,000 miles,
spending immense time and money fora
brief visit with family and friends.
Thanksgiving is, in the most simplistic def
inition, a day for giving thanks. We take the
time lo appreciate the simple and often-over
looked blessings in our lives. In spending time
with our loved ones, we recognize the neces
sity of human love, compassion and support.
In feasting, we appreciate the abundances
that grace our lives.
The recognition of these two fundamental
needs — interpersonal and physical suste
nance — transcends religious and cultural
differences. Gratitude is an expression that
every culture, religion, philosophy or belief
system appreciates in some form. Its rele

vance is non-exclusive.
Clearly, the origins of Thanksgiving have
their dubious aspects. The pilgrims and
American Indians had a long and brutal his
tory of altercations and injustices.
It is absolutely necessary for people to be
educated about these conflicts, to understand
that the traditional image of the idyllic
Thanksgiving feast was perhaps the antithesis
of the usual relationship betwen pilgrims and
American Indians.
However, there is redemption in the fact
that despite the historical offenses between
pilgrims and American Indians, the two
groups managed somehow to come together
in cooperation and celebration, at least mo
mentarily. Such mutual and tacit thankfulness
for human life and sustenance is the blessing
of Thanksgiving.

Thanksgiving reminds us that we are all
human. As such, we have infinite amounts of
wisdom to offer each other.
So celebrate your holidays and speak your
truths; learn about others' traditions, teach
them about yours.
We are thankful that the University recog
nizes the importance of 111 is holiday by host
ing a Thanksgiving feast for Stanford-bound
students. We are thankful for professors who
cancel Wednesday afternoon classes so that
students can travel home to spend all of
Thanksgiving day with their families.
We are grateful for the opportunity to ap
preciate simple human needs and for the im
plicit recognition that, as Stanford students
and individuals with unique histories, we all
depend upon the same emotional, spiritual
and physical sustenance.
