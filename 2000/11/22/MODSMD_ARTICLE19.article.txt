## The
						standardized threat 
### 
U he LSAT was designed by
Satan," my Princeton Re
view instructor concluded
.JL. after six weeks of drilling
and strategizing.
Indeed, the devil has been busy lately
making numbers the measure of man. First
came the Intelligence Quotient lest, the suc -
cessful application of which, earlv 20th-cen
tury eugenicists hoped, would prevent the
more-advanced and less-advanced races
from mixing
indiscriminately.

Soon followed the
SAT, the PSAT, the
LSAT, the GMAT, the
MCAT and who knows
what next. Perhaps a
Dating Aptitude Test
Examination (DATE)
that weighs some combi
nation of your waistline,
height, personality and

chances of scoring the keys to Daddy's Ben/
in order to determine whether or not you
should leave your room Friday night.
As always, though, tlu- devil deserves his
due.
Before the SA P, going to elite universi
ties was like working for the post oil ice for
the youth of America's upper crust. Few got
rejected, once one was admitted little work
was expected and it was nearly impossible to
get rid of anyone. The students, almost uni
formly white, Protestant and male, treated
the faculty like the servants at their parents'
estate.
Describing student life tor the rich young
men at Harvard during the Great Depres
sion, Nicholas Lemman writes, "At a time
when a quarter of the American workforce
was unemployed and desperate, they lived
m private apartments, attended by butlers
and maids."
Whatever their practical shortcomings,
standardized aptitude tests force students
from diverse economic backgrounds to
prove themselves on the same playing field.
Such examinations have played a part in the
recognition of what Jefferson called "the
aristocracy of virtue and talent."
To reject all standardized tests would Ik*
to risk returning education to the privileged
lew, taking from economically disadvan
taged students a valuable opportunity to get
ahead. A better proposition would lx- to
maintain the current system, only making it
more equitable, less arbitrary and less un
pleasant.
First, the prcxess of requiring standard
ized testing for increasingly young s< hool
children runs contrary to the premise that

these examinations will produce a new elite
chosen strictly In academic merit. During a
student's earl) life, most likeh spent livingat
home, the influences of his parentage are
most pronounced. It is no wonder that
ranking children l>\ tests so often means list
ing them according to their parents' in
come.
A mt >re democratic way of administering
standardized tests would be to delay them,
meanwhile offering students an opportuni
ty to distinguish themselves from their ( lass
backgrounds. For example, instead of offer
ing the SAf to juniors in high school, en
courage all high school students to take a
fifth "service" year, working away from
home, perhaps even overseas.
Second, if we want our test-beaters to
come from a diverse range of socioeco
nomic backgrounds, our educational es
tablishment needs to open its doors
wider. Currently, our public school sys
tem is far from public. A sensible vouch
er program would add much-needed di
versity to many of Our public and private
institutions.
As Polly Williams, a Milwaukee Demo
crat and veteran school-choice propo
nent, argued, "Why should the president
be the only person living in public hous
ing who gets to send his children to pri
vate schools?"
Third, a suggestion for students: Don't
check your scores. Ask yourself this ques
tion: Would you measure your height and
weight or any other arbitrarily determined
standards of comeliness before deciding if
you're worthy of asking a certain someone
to the movies? I hope not.
Numbers should not determine all of
our decisions or ever define us as people.
Not knowing your score also provides
the benefit of'no one c lose to you finding out
how you did. In other words, it saves you the
embarrassment of overhearing you mom
explain to the guy sitting next to her on an
airplane how well you did on the English
Advanced Placement test.
Moreover, not knowing your own score
means not having to compare yourself to
anyone else. There is nothing objectionable
about requiring students to master certain
material. But when master) of material is
mixed, or even replaced, in the student's
mind with a desire to score higher than his
c lassmates, envy is introduced into the pro
cess.
And envy, the Bible says, is the devil's
greatest trick.
