Foothills lor 99 years is no
longer being considered by the
Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors according to an ar
ticle in yesterday's San Jose
Mercury News.
Donald (>age, the chair ol the
Board of Supervisors, is quoted
as saying, "Ninety-nine years —
lorget that. But there's a lot of
other compromises."
I he article savs that the 99-
year proposal was set aside be
cause ol concerns that it would
leave the County vulnerable to
lawsuits.
Cage could not be readied
yesterday for further comment.
"I think this sends a message
to the development community

threaten a lawsuit, the Stan

the article.
Fnvironmcntal groups such
as the Stanford Open Spate Al

any development ban longer
than 25 years would be unac

The supervisors are sched
uled to vote Mondav over Stan

cently elected to the State As
sembly and has said he plans to
leave the board in December.
