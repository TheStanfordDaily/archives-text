Time for University to end grape vote
Asa freshman here at Stanford Univer
sity, I was surprised, to say the least, when
I learned of the annual vote taken to de
termine whether or not grapes should be
served in University dining halls.
I had always thought of a boycott as a
personal choice made individually, not as a
choice made collectively and enforced
upon individuals.
It is time to end the institutionalized ban
on grapes at Stanford University. Yester
day, tlu- United Farm Workers officially
announced that it was ending the boycott,
as their initial demands for better enforce
ment of labor laws and the banning of cer
tain pesticides had been met.
Therefore, I believe that it istimeforthe
University to end its annual vote on
whether or not to serve grapes.

Lighten up on Gaieties and Big Game
I would like to thank you for printing
"Gaieties scene sparks controversy,
protest" on Nov. 20. I completely agree
that it is negligent for Gaieties staff not to
realize how offensive their work can he.
Gaieties is supposed to be a lighthearted
musical that everyone can enjoy. I applaud
the efforts that the board of directors of
Ram's Head Theatrical Society has

pledged i<> lake, such as sending drafts of
i he scripts to members of ethnic communi
ties and inviting members of ethnic groups
to preview the show.
I lowever, this does not go far enough.
Could Rita Ng, a Stanford graduate who
won Miss California and took third in the
Miss America competition, have been of
fended by the inatct'iate portrayal ola
beautv contest? Are the Stanford Yachts
men, ROTC, Viennese Ball, et al., offend
ed that they were identified with the Vil
lage People?
To avoid offending the students and
alumni who attend Caieties, the Ram's
Head board of directors should get rid of
the traditional secrecy surrounding the
production and make the script available
to everyone in advance. Then anyone may
review it and contact the (iaicties staff with
concerns and objections.
And what about the one group that (lai
eties consistently ridicules and stereotypes
without any just cause: UC-Berkeley?
Some of my best friends are Cal Students!
Why must Caieties portray them as being
dim-witted athletes with names like "Jock
strap, as androgynous winners and I'oke
tnon-obsessed Asians?
I low offended do you think (Chancellor
Robert M. Berdahl would be if he knew
about his portrayal as the evil Stan
(chancellor?
This problem is not confined to Gaieties
alone. The band impaled a bear on the
(Claw at their annual Bearial. At the pre
game bonfire rally, teddy bears were

ripped apart and burned. Kven The Daily
m ilie same issue in which the editoria
board ran a piece telling us to "tone dovvi
the insults" ("lone down aggression, in
suits during Big (ianie," Nov. 20), printe(
a picture ol the Band's Tubas spelling on
"BEAI KAL" with the caption "... writ
ten phonetically, so that the (California lan
can understand."
We should make the Ciaieties script, tin
Band's show plans and I he Daily availabli
to Berkeley before they are performed o
printed, to insure that no one is offended.
Or could it be that people are takinj
(iaieties, the Band and perhaps even Th«
Daily a little too seriously?

Stanford-Cal rivalry was never friendly
I lie Daily recently described the com
petitive relationship between Stanford am
I C-Berkeley asa "friendly, playful rivalry
(" l one down aggression, insults during
Bijj C»ame," Nov. 20). Stanford student
are also summoned to "re-establish respec
for our beloved tradition."
I couldn't agree more. I don't thin!
people appreciate the foundation of tin
(iame rivalry: respect and friendship.
I he Stanford Axe, the hallowed trophy
and symbol of Stanford unity, was first un
veiled at .1 Cal-Stanfbrd baseball game in the
IS ( .)()s. Stanford faithful used it to violently
butcher a toy bear in a demonstration of the teas
ing, fun-loving brotherhood between the Farm
and Berkeley.
There is a tree on the corner of Campus and
(ialvez known as the"I lampion ()ak." Ii is a spe
cial landmark, celebrated by this university with
a bron/ed plaque. This is where, in the early '40s,
Gordon Hampton, a freshman assigned to de
lend the bonfire which used to be erected at the
current site of Frost Amphitheatre, signaled to
his compatriots living in Kncina 1 fall that ('.allies
were approaching to sabotage the bonfire.
Many a happy, amorous drop of blood was
subsequently shed in defense of the bonfire, and
the ( al perpetrators retreated to Berkeley, smil

ini; an( l laughing through their swollen, blood
soaked laces at memories oft he amicable, whole
some riot they had just suffered through.
Many years later, as the bondage of love be
tween the two schools solidified, Stanford stu
dents playfully adopted the epithet "Weenie" to
address their Cal brethren. Cal responded by
creating the tradition of spelling the name of our
school "StanFl ! rd" in their anti-Stanford propa
ganda. Such heart-warming banter!
fhe big (iamesof the '80s and early ,( .)()s were
particularly noteworthy for the bone-crushing
tackles of the opponents' mascot and tight-spi
raling throws of smoke bombs and rotten or
anges from the stands. And continuing today,
who doesn't appreciate the rampant acts of van
dalism on our campus committed by Berkeley
faithful? 1 1ist goes to show that they care.
Seriously, the idea that the relationship be
tween Stanford and ('.al is friendly and based on
mutual respect is a recent construct of both ad
ministrations. Downplaying the violence, the

malfeasance and blatant demonstrations of dis
respect that are the true foundation of the Big
Game is understandable; it would be an admin
istrative nightmare to condone such actions.
I he sexism and racism which fhe Daily claims
have tarnished the sanctity of the tradition is an
unfortunate invasion of personal ignorance. Car
dinal versus blue and gold should be the only
dash of colors at Big Game. But Fhe Daily's in
dictment of classism is a further demonstration of
the paper's own ignorance of the reality of the Big
Game rivalry and rivalries in general.
Fo celebrate this "beloved" tradition is to cel
ebrate its fundamental philosophy, grounded in
a storied history of animosity: Cal thinks that
Stanford sucks, and Stanford knows that Cal
sucks.
SAT scores and illustrious alumni aside, at
least we have the Axe to prove it.
