## Weighing University assets: The undervalued academic staff 
### ALAN TEO GUEST COLUMNIST 
Willi President Hennessy s an
nouncement of'ihe unprece
dented $1 billion fund-rais
ing ellbrt for undergraduate
education and lauding of interdisciplinary
programs such as I iuman Biology, now is
an exciting time for undergraduate educa
tion. Yet if we are to truly value the under
graduate educational experience, then we
must celebrate the spectrum of contribu
tors to it. One group of contributors —
"academic stall" by paper title, but better
called "inspiring advocates" — often play a
tremendous but overlooked role in educat
ing undergraduates.
Inquiring into the University's current
attitude toward academic stall, especially
in the practices of such highly regarded in
letdisciplinary programs as I luman Biolo
gy, makes one realize Itovv these heroes of

undergraduate education remain unsung.
These lecturers, consulting professors
and senior research scholars do an im
mense amount of teaching. Often well
published and having had other career ex
periences, they actually do the majority of
teaching in elective Human Biology
courses.
Despite being at least as busy as mem
bers of the Academic Council, these teach
ers often make more time lot undergradu
ates than those members and thus often
contribute disproportionately to under
graduate education.
Contrary to the widespread student im
pression that tuition dollars go towards
classes (students only hail-facetiously talk
of the dollar value of each minute in class),
the many of us who take courses from peo
ple we call "professor" but are c ategorized
as "lecturer" do not realize how little is
spent supporting the organizer atid teach
er of the course.

For instance, Human Biology pays
$4,000 to a lecturer to teach classes of lew -
erthan 40 students and $(>,500 for classes
with more than 40 students enrolled. By
comparison, seniors acting as assistants to
the Biology 44 laboratory series in equally
sized courses earn more than half the
salaries of these professors!
The so-called academic stall can be
found outside of Human Biology, across
the spectrum of interdisciplinary pro
grams, from Americ an Studies to Feminist
Studies to Public Policy to International
Relations. Many undergraduates major in
these interdisciplinary programs, and
1 luman Biology is one of the most popular
majors.
The people who have had the most in
fluential roles in my college blossoming do
not receive enough recognition for the
their labors of love. My Resident Fellow,
Armin Rosencranz, has tirelessly written
letter after letter of recommendation on

behalf of his students.
Mark YVeiner, then aj.l). / I'll.1). candi
date from Yale Law School, opened my
eyes to the challenges of multiculturalism
during my freshman year. More than
once, lie invited me to lunch at the Coflee
House to discuss class issues, and he has
kept in contact with me ever since.
Bill Hurlbut, the man largely responsi
ble for putting the word "hioethics" into
the vocabulary of undergraduates and for
whom I am now a teaching associate, per
sonally touches the lives of many under
graduates.
All of these people have been deemed
academic stall officially, yet their status
goes far beyond what is represented by
their small pay checks.
The argument that lecturers may have
alternate means of support does not excuse
underpaying them for their tremendous
role in teaching and advising
undergraduates.

I would make two modest requests for
improving the respect for and condition <>l
academic stall. First, devise awards specifi
cally highlighting these people and groups
who touch the lives ol and provide
tremendous direction to undergraduates.
Second, use some ol the $ 1 billion fund
raising ellbrt to raise the salary ol those on
lecturer status. It is egregious of an institu
tion ol ihis caliber to pav lecturers a salan
so low that if they made a full-time proles
sion ol teaching, they could not survive.
Many undergraduates view these won
derful educators in the same way that they
view professors. Indeed, students often do
not know the official distinction because
academic staff contribute so much to the
undergraduate educational experience. 1
