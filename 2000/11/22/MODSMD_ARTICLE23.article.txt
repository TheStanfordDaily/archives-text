# The

## Sketchy or just lonely?

K.u li [)<>< kel ol llie c<>lllllla has its own veisions (»l urban
legends. It seems Si.ml<>rd is noe\<cption. C ..tmpiis lore is noi
rife with gorv <le!ails<>l si.ilkei sand serial killers. I >ill inan\ un

What is a skeli 11\ graduate student"' At liist blush, the an
swer is simple.
"A sket< 11 \ graduate student is (someone) still Irving to he
undergrad — going to Iratei nit\ parties and hiltingon fresh
man girls." scnioi Kmilic Johnson said.
Kut alter surveying graduate and undergraduate stu
dents. more questions emerge. I low does one define being
sket( li\ in concrete terms.' W hat is the disc ernihle hehavior
behind this lihcralh applied let in?
I he origins ol the phenomenon ma\ deal with dillercnccs
in perception between foreign students and Americans, age
gaps and the gendci imbalance in gt adualc departments.
A recent graduate who works in ()ld I nion attributes the
label to cult in al clillei ences at Stanford.
She had alwavsthought of "skct< In grad students" as being
l<)i eign men in the (ollec I louse who unabashedh begin con
versations with undergraduate women. But. she points out,
theii actions are onh seen as skew h\ in light ol the conserva
tive, uptight altitudes of most undetgtaduates.
She said the undet gi adualec ommunitv is< hat acteri/.ed b\
"a small social scene in whit h |there are) sell absorbed, suc
cess-oriented undet gt,ids w ho are ver\ protective ol their
pet son,il space."
I he foreign student who does not understand Stanford's
standoffish cm ironmcnt is tagged loi bchavioi that is consid
ered lot ward yet (|uile normal outside ol Stanford, and even
more so outside of the I nilcd States, she s.iid.
Several foreign graduate students said the\ do not see age
as a bat tier to dating.
"In (icrmany, there was no difference between under
graduate and graduate students." said an electi ical engineer
ing graduate student liom Ciermam who wished not to be
named.
For example, he said, all students lived in the same plat es
regardless ol atadcmic standing.
A Spanish graduate student in the Klectrical Kngineering
Department echoed this age-blind sentiment In recalling
that, in Spain, it is not taboo loi a pet son to date someone live
years older or live \cai s vounger then him- or herself.
"As a foreign student w ho is n \ ing to meet .is mam people
r is possible on campus, I would not sec it as strange to ap
proach or even dale an undergraduate female student," he

said.
Is this sketi hincssor |iist plain confidence?
|ohnson thinks there are mam undergraduate males who
<an also be des< ribed .is sketi h\. but theii at lions seem to be
more permissible.
"As .m undergraduate, von are excused from being
skctchv, like fraternity l)o\s, athletes, Ircsluncn," she said.
"< )nce you are a grad student, you're a dork, and dorks aren't
supposed to be sket( liv."
"Skett 11 \ glad students are people loo," said |on Wells, a
graduate student in the Knvironmcntal Kngineering I)epart
mcni
I lie dearth of female graduate students in some depart
ments. especially the hard sciences, is another reason why
oldei students seek out vounger women, several graduate
students said.
A graduate student in the Klectrical Kngineering Depart
ment said there are ver\ lew women in his department. A stu
dent in the Applied I'hysit s Department, who studied at (Cor
nell during Ins undergraduate years, was quick to reply,
" I here are even fewer women in my department."
I'lie applied physic s student related how "skeh liiness" is
less ol ,i graduate student phenomenon than a Silicon Valley
marvel. I le described an < >ldcr Intel of lite worker who attends
ballroom dancing classes al Stanford in order to meet the
vounger Stanford women.
Several graduate students said sc >mc areas of c ampus, su< h
as the Medical School, have a more evenly split male and le
m.ile population and have the least need lor dating under
graduates.
A recurring theme during discussions of skeu In behavior
is that skew liiness is a male < liarac teristic.
All the female students interviewed said they could not le
counl am stories about Ictnalc graduate students acting inap
propriately . ()ne male graduate student said women can be
skctchv and that "guvs don't mind it as much."
So is sketc liiness a graduate school phenomenon? It de
pends on your perspective. According to mam students on
c ampus, women seem a bit more sensitive to such unwanted
advances.
I he majority ol undergraduate and graduate men said
they have never heard ol the invtli of the sketchy graduate
student.
(in Is are once again exaggerating about nothing," sopho
more 1 >ave Vasen said.
Wells, who is a Suites eating < lub manager, admitted that
as a graduate student w ho had spent his nuclei graduate years
at Stanford, he decided not to attend the Suites formal.
I didn't want to be tli.it skctchv grad student," he said.
