# Undergrad parents want needs addressed
## 
### DAVID ABRIL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Some undergraduate parents
leel thai a report on the conditions
<>l parents within tlie Stanford com
munity neglected their needs.
At the Faculty Senate meeting
on Nov. 30, Provost 'John
l'.tchemendy will release a summa
r\ report prepared by the Stanford
Work-Life Office. The report, ac
cording to Work-Life Office Direc
tor Kathleen K. Sullivan, will ad
dress the availability and at lord
ability of daycare in the Stanford
area. 1 he report draws upon the
experiences of faculty, stall and stu
dents vviih children.
"There should have been discus
sion centered around students not
being able to get available childcare
or affordable childcare," senior
Masud Shamsid-Deen said. " I he
market is very competitive, and the
inability to have childcare affects
our ability to settle in as Stanford
students."
According to Sullivan, her office
did not become aware of the small
contingent ol undergraduate par
ents until the report was being fi
nalized, alter a needs assessment
had already been conducted.
Sullivan also noted that many ol
i lie undergraduate parents lack in
lormation about parenting re
st turces on campus.
"()ur office is act ually not widely
known, so a lot of the undergrad
students with families only became
aware ol us last year,"' she said.
I he most pressing issue lacing
Stanford parents is the shortage of
davcare service m the area. Ac
cording to Shamsid-Deen, the
shortage of daycare service is espe
< lallv problematic lor student par
ents because thc\ are circumstan
tia 11 \ disadvantaged by the wait
ing-list procedure at the Stanford
davcare centers and then limited
inc dines.
I he waiting lisis require parents
to wait anywhere from nine months
i<> two years lor a spot. Until a spot

opens up, parents must look else
where lor daycare and often make
the commute to centers in Red
wood City or Mountain View.
Hut sometimes these centers
have wait lists as well or ( barge pro
hibitivcl) high rates. When sopho
more Daria Lisa couldn't find an
available daycare center, she tried
hiring a family to take care of her
son. But the family refused to take
him after her school schedule
proved to be too irregular lor their
services.
Living costs for student parents,
even beyond those associated with
child care, are also higher than
those ol other students because
families are assigned to Lscondido
Village, where rent is $1,500-
$2,000 more per year than regular
campus housing. The Office ol fi
nancial Aid handles students with
children on ac ase-by-case basis and
usually awards more funding in ac
cordance to their atypical budgets.
Shamsid-Deen, however, was
skeptical of aid arrangements.
" There doesn't seem to be a set
way ol distributing money for
childcare costs," he said. "That
money could just be in the form ol
extra loans. I don't understand
why, if the University is running
their own daycare centers, students
are paying just as much as people
outside the community. I here
needs to be some way of subsidizing
costs of childcare or space alloca
tion."
Undergraduate student parents
are slowly being incorporated into
the University's discussion about
parenting issues on campus.
Since submitting the report, the
Work-Life ollice has established a
working group to meet with stu
dent parents and lias held .in ori
entation to introduce them to par
enting resources. Shamsid-Deen is
currently organizing other student
parents and meeting with Work-
Life, ASSU representatives and
University officials to discuss cost
management and possible solu
tions to daycare overcrowding.
