I lie two seniors on the Stanford women's vollev
l).ill leainhave found their final season on the Farm
tilled with more struggles than their first three sea
sons combined.
But as the No. 20 Cardinal showed last night
against No. I 1 Santa (llara in Stanlbrd's regular sea
son finale, seniors Finelsa\ Kagawa and Jennifer l)et
mer still could have a lot more volleyball to plav be
fore their careers are over.
Stanford (1 <S-1 I) dosed out its regular season with
a grim four-game viciorv over a surging Santa ('.lara
scjuad (2C>-4) on Senior Night in Maples Pavilion.
With the vidory, Stanford still has a < hance of being
selected as a host for first- and second-round match
es of the NC:.\A tournament.
Stanford effectively shut down Santa Clara's ol
fense, which came into the match leading the nation
in kills per game. In a testament to the strong de
fense, neither side hit over .200 for the mate h.
"We were giving them points on passing errors
<md hitting errors," said junior middle bloc ker l ara
C onrad. "But our points were .ill created In us, so we
controlled most ol the match.
Stanford struggled with passing on and off
throughout the mate h, causing inconsistencies in the
(lardinal attack.
" I Itev served tough and we haven't practiced
against the deep serves that ilic\ were hitting," said
interim head coach Denise C oriel I. "We passed well
enough to get us In tonight, but I know we c an plav
a lot better."
I he (Cardinal played a nine li stronger game at the
net than it had m its last few male lies, out bloc king the
Broncos 12-H for the mate h.
Fhe emotions were running high on ihe Stanford
side of the court alter a preganie < crcinom honored
Kagawa and Del met lot their vcars in cardinal reel.
I hose emotions got the better of the Stanford, which

looked rather unsettled early.
Flie Bronc os ran oil the first six points ol the game
before the (lardinal could gel on the board, extend
ing an earl) 9-1 lead. Stanford's offense stumbled as
passing problems prevented it from setting any
strong attacks.
Fhe Cardinal attack finally came alive once Santa
( lara readied game point at 14-2. Junior outside bil
let Sara Sandrik c ame off the bench and picked up
three big kills to bring the Cardinal back into the
match.
Stanford held oil three game points, closing the
gap to I 1-0, but the Broncos finally scored to end
game one wit li a 1 f>-0 win. Santa (Mara picked up 1 S
kills in ihe first game while holding Stanford to
only 10.
"I think we were a little overly-excited coining into
the first game, and that led to the slow start," Conrad
said.
Stanford started slow in game two, as the Broncos'
defense was too strong lor the (Cardinal attack. Down
(i-0, the Cardinal pic keel up its game at the net.
Strong Stanford blocking forced several Santa Clara
errors, allowing Stanford to run off eight straight
points to take an H-(> lead.
Stanford clung to an 1 1-10 lead when freshman
outside hitter Sara Dukes entered the match, giving
the Stanford oflense a burst of energy. A kill by Dukes
closed out a 1 T>-10 win lot the Cardinal.
I he Stanford attack kept up its momentum head
ing into game three, helped greatly by strong receiv
ing and passing liroin the back court. The Cardinal
took a commanding 1 .'5-2 lead as Tom stepped up her
pla\ and Dukes and Sandrik continued their strong
showings.
"It's huge having dependable players who can
< oine into the mate li late and play that well," (onrael
said of I hikes and Sandrik.
"I ,indsa\ (Kagawa) did an excellent job setting for
me tonight,' I hikes said. "She set balls so 1 had only
one oi no bloc kers m front of me which made pick
