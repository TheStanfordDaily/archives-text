doming into the NdAA tour
nament among the top rankedin
the country, one would think the
Stanford men's soccer team
would look to cruise through the
opening rounds with their sights
firmly set on the (Championship
crown.
But despite a seemingly easy
advance in the first round after
heating da I State lullcrton 4-0,
the dardinal knows it can't take
any game for granted.
"Scoring font goals in the first
25 minutes was an ama/ing start
for us on Saturday," said senior
midfielder Sean Sylvis. "But,
there were still periods in the
game when we could have played
better. At this point in the year,
the games will only get more
competitive and physical and we
have to make sure that we give

awa\ .is few opportunities .is pos
sible."
Now 17-2-1, the Cardinal
looks ahead to Saturdax as it
plays host to the I 'niversity of Illi
nois at ( hicago lor the first-ever
match up between these two
teams.
UK 1 is oft to one ol its best sea
sons in s< liool history. In beating
Bradley I -0 toadvam e tot lie sec
ond round of the tournament,
the Flames improved their best
ever season record to 18-U-l.
However, the Flames only
laced one tournament team in
the regular season, losing to No.
1-seeded North Carolina. But,
with intensity high and the test ol
the season on the litie the (Cardi
nal will have to expect everything
from its opponent.
