### ALEX BENJAMIN STAFF WRITER 
doming into the NdAA tour
nament among the top rankedin
the country, one would think the
Stanford men's soccer team
would look to cruise through the
opening rounds with their sights
firmly set on the (Championship
crown.
But despite a seemingly easy
advance in the first round after
heating da I State lullcrton 4-0,
the dardinal knows it can't take
any game for granted.
"Scoring font goals in the first
25 minutes was an ama/ing start
for us on Saturday," said senior
midfielder Sean Sylvis. "But,
there were still periods in the
game when we could have played
better. At this point in the year,
the games will only get more
competitive and physical and we
have to make sure that we give

awa\ .is few opportunities .is pos
sible."
Now 17-2-1, the Cardinal
looks ahead to Saturdax as it
plays host to the I 'niversity of Illi
nois at ( hicago lor the first-ever
match up between these two
teams.
UK 1 is oft to one ol its best sea
sons in s< liool history. In beating
Bradley I -0 toadvam e tot lie sec
ond round of the tournament,
the Flames improved their best
ever season record to 18-U-l.
However, the Flames only
laced one tournament team in
the regular season, losing to No.
1-seeded North Carolina. But,
with intensity high and the test ol
the season on the litie the (Cardi
nal will have to expect everything
from its opponent.

Both Shanalian and Murphy

look to put friendship aside in
order to advance into the round
of eight.
Alter Stanford's dissatisfaction
with Saturday's win, the Cardinal
felt some amount of relief making
ii past the first round.
"It's nice to get that first tourna
ment game under our belts," said
senior Luke Rust. "Now we've got
some tournament confidence and
we're ready to go all the way.
" I lie team looks encrgi/cd and
poised fbi battle and I think that our
win on Saturday actually released a
little pressure rather than adding to
it. Alter an early exit last year to
Santa (llara, n lelt great to get that
kind of a start to the playolls."
With Saturday's victory <>ver the
Titans, the(Cardinal is now 5-5-1 in
its seven appearances in the
NCAA's.
In the past four years, Stanford
has made four consecutive trips to
the tournament but has been un
successful in its attempt to capture
a national championship.
This year, the Cardinal may

have its best chance. During the
regular season, Stanford posted a
f-2-1 record against the five tour
nament opponents it faced, split
ting two games each against Wash
ington <ind U( LA, tying San Jose
State and defeating Indiana and
1 )artmouth.
On both oflensc and defense
the team has been nearly untouch
able. Through 20 games t lie C Cardi
nal has managed to out score oppo
nents (i 1 -8. At the back senior goal
keeper Adam Xapala lias lead the
team to the nation s best goals
against average and with last week
end's shutout
Zapala has now blanked lf>
teams this year, tying him for most
shutouts in a single season, a
record he set in 1 ( .K)8.
As in any other week the team
will concentrate on the game at
hand and Ibrget about the win over
(lal State Fuller"ton.
"We are definitely feeling good
about ourselves, but we have spent
Kill season leadiing ourselves jo
look at this year's season one game
at a time instead of as a whole." said
junior Aaron Biddle. "It has
worked so far to help ease some
pressure."
And, with a Fhanksgiving least
on Thursday, the team will be fired
up and ready for the Flames.
"I think we'll be ready," said se
nior (orey Woollblk. "We're look
ing forward toa big turkey feed on
Thursday all together up at
Coach's house and hopefully that
will fuel us through to the next
round. It's going to be a battle, but
I think that we all know that."
The battle begins Saturday at
7:! M) p.m. at New Maloney Field.
