# Woolfolk's hard work not done yet
## 
### JIMMY WU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford soccer has its own Cal Ripken. In
a spoil that depends on hard fought
per'server«uke and exhausting endurance, sel
dom does the record hook pay homage to the
team player that endured minute alter minute
on the field, instead favoring the legacies of
brilliant scorers or strong goalies.
Senior captain ('.orey Wool folk finally has .1
statistic that begins to tell of his value to Ins
team. "C-l)ub" as he is referred to In team
mates, has broken the soccer record for games
played, tallying minutes in even game in Ins
four years at the Farm.
A powerful striker, Woolfolk has been
among the- leaders in goals and assists 111 his
four seasons for the Cardinal, blowing past
opponents with raw speed and tenacious loot
work.
But in Division I soccer, strong play and
natural ability aren't the only things that de
termine .1 player's time on the field. It is rare
lor an athlete to play for four straight vears
without injury in the intensely physical and
demanding sport.
"I think I have been lucky," Woolfolk said.
"Cod has looked after me and kept me rela
tively injury free."
Woolfolk emphasized that what drives him
the most are the guys who work just as hard ,is
he does every day during practice and don't
nec essarily see as 11111 c h time on the field.
"I have respect for the guys I line up with
and share «i locker room with," Woolfolk said.
"Come game time, I do not want to let them
down."
While playing time is coveted on the com
petitive squad, teammates are quick to point
out Woolfblk's selfless nature.
"On the field, he is one ol the the most
hard-working, team-oriented individual that 1
have ever played with."said senior forward
Luke Rust.
Another teammate for four years, senior
midfielder Sean Sylvis, echoed Rust's
thoughts about Woolfolk.
"He has a quiet, but knowing, leadership
quality to him." Sylvis said. "Corey provides a
calming influence in the team, especially 011
the field."
A soccer player since he was five years old,
Woolfolk began playing the game when he ex
pressed the desire to follow in his older broth
er's footsteps.
