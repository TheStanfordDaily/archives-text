1 low is a coach measured?
One lesi is I he success of his players. Stan
lord women's swimming head coach Richard
Quick has produced more NCAA champions,
coached more Olympic games and won more
lilies lhan any other in the sport. Beyond all
the honors, he has commanded the respect of
his players, fellow coaches and ihe community
of swimming.
Ii was 6:45 a.m. Mist rose from the heated
pool in ihe fro/en morning. "Let's rock and
roll, ladies," Quick said. Svelte, shark-like
swimmers dove inio the lank propelling
through the water at a perilous pace. Eight sets
of 400 meters were protocol after an early
workout of spinning or running that began in
the predawn hours.
Quick's swimming school stresses several
lessons.
Lesson No. 1: Practice the way you play.
Quick spoke to his underwater school, en
couraging each swimmer to reach her poten
tial, beat her times.
"At the end of the race you want to have
great legs, so let's finish this practice with great
legs," lie said.
"I expect world class effort in the pool,
l hese two hours a day should be dedicated to
swimming. But alter practice, I want them to
be 100 percent Stanford students."
Lesson No. 2: Don't preach unless you've

been there.
Quick knows the rigors of training and com
petition first-hand. He swam his first meet at
age nine. As a junior competitor, Quick was
coached by Bob 1 immons, who headed men's
track and field at the University of Kansas for
22 years.
Quick became an All-American swimmer at
Southern Methodist I niversitv. After graduat
ing, he began a coaching career that would
make him one of the most lauded names in
swimming worldwide.
Lesson N0.3: Believe in your dreams.
Quick had justone reason for coaching.
"When I started coaching it was to be like
Mr. Timmons, to help young people."
I n 1976 Quick began his career by establish
ing the women's swimming program at SMU,
his alma mater. I lie program became one of
the top in the country.
Bv 1982 he wascoachingat the University of
Texas, where his team won five consecutive
NCAA National Team Championships from
1084-1988, the longest women's swimming
streak ever.
He took over Stanford's program in 1988.
Now in his thirteenth season at the Farm,
Quick has earned his reputation for success,
guiding the women's swim team to seven
NCAA National titles.
"It's been a dream come true to coach here.
It's the greatest feeling to talk to a prospective
student-athlete and tell them about the experi
ence that is Stanford."

Lesson N0.4: Treat everyone equally.
Quick has ihe ability to bring out the best in
lus swimmers, whether they are swimmers on
the Stanford team or athletes he is coaching on
an international trip.
Involved with nearly every meet in which
the United States has participated in over the
past sixteen years, Quick won the American
Swimming Coaches Association Coach of the
Year award three times.
Selected to coach the U.S. Olympic Team at
the past five Olympic Games, Quick most re
cently headed the women's team at the 2000
(Mympics in Sydney.
"It's a tremendous honor to represent your
country in international competition as an ath
lete and it's the same fora coach," he said. "But
its also a great responsibility."
With only a month between the ()lympic tri
als and the games, not only did Quick have to
concentrate on training the Olympians for
their events but also adapt athletes to the- team
concept.
"You're dealing with the dreams of athletes.
The goal of the ()lympic coach is to establish an
environment that allows each athlete to reach
their potential."
Melding 24 swimmers from different
backgrounds and training regiments was not
easy. Adding to the pressure, many swim
mers were competing in the same event .is
their American teammates.

Women's swimming head coach Richard Quick speaks to his team during
the national championship season of 1989, his first season at the reigns of
the program. Quick has guided Stanford to seven women's national titles
since taking the head coaching position.
"li s trie kv business when they're asked to work
and train together at the (iames. I'h rough great
leadership on the part of our athletes and the co
operation of the coach we achieved wonderful
chemistry. We <ill worked towards a < 0111111011 goal."
I .csson No. ">: ()pen yourself to the possibilities,
(ioing into the (iames, the U.S. Olympic l earn
was only favored to win one gold metal. Not only
did the I S. team win seven gold medals 111 Sydney,
it broke two world records â€”in the 400-meter
freestyle relay and 400-meter medley relay.
I lu- biggest upset c ame in the 200-meter butter
fly in which Stanford senior Misty I lyman beat de
fending champion Susan O'Neill, who hadn't lost
the event in six years.
I.ike all the athletes Quick works with, he en
couraged flyman to believe in herself.
"Richard cares about everyone on the team."

1 1\ man said Ile gave me the courage to reach my
potential 111 Svdney. Before my event lie said to me,
A on know what to do. Now just go out there and
do it.' "
Wise in his H. r >th year as a coach, Quick said,
"Some people are so closed to the possibilities, they
wouldn't open themselves up to all the opportuni
ties that exist in their lives."
So what's next?
"We are bidding to have the 2012 (iames in the
Bay Area. I'd like to have swimming light here at
Stanford."
Soon .construction of the Avery Aquatic ( .enter
will be complete and Stanford will have two 50-
meter pen >ls and two diving wells as well as 25-meter
pools.
"By tlu- lime we're done, we will have the finest
outdoor facility 111 the world," Quick said
When construction is finally finished, Stanford
will have a fa< ilit\ fit for the championship-caliber
program that Quick has built as the (Cardinal head
mac It.
