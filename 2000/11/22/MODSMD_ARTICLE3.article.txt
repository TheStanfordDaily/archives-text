The United Farm Workers union ended its

yesterday, hailing the longest ol three such
boycotts organized by the union. Fverv year
since 1994, Stanford students have voted on

whether their dining halls
should participate in the boycott.
Fhe annual vote determines
which dining halls will serve
grapes during the coining year.
Stanford officials have yet to
decide what to do regarding iliis
year's vole, which took place last
week.
"()nlv a handful of people lit
erally know at this moment the
UFW called an end to the boy-

cott, so there is no official I 'niversitv response
yet," said Fommv Lee W'oon, assistant dean of
students and multicultural educator. "1 will be
consulting with administrators."
On June 12, 1984, UFW co-founder Cesar
Chavez called for the start of the boycott as a
way to focus on the spraying of dangerous pes
ticides in the grape fields. But according to
I F\\ President Arturo Rodriguez, the boycott

ended because some of its goals have ahead)
been met.
"(lesar ('.havez's crusade lo eliminate use ol
live of the most toxic chemicals plaguing farm
workers and their families has been largely suc
cessful," Rodriguez stated in a letter vesterday.
"Ii is not lair to ask our supporters to honor a
boycott when the union miisi devote all of its
present resources toward organizing and nego
tiating contracts."
Rodriguez, added that three of the toxic
chemicals, Dinoseb. parathion ,in<l I'hosdrin,
are gone. A fourth, methyl bromide, was sei to
be banned in 2000, but the deadline was ex
lended to 2005. Also, severe restrictions have
been placed on use of the fifth chemical, (lap
tan.
"There is also new hope for meaningful en
forcement of California's historic farm labor

law from (iov. (lra\ I )a\ is's appointees to
the Agricultural l.alx>i Relations Hoard,"
Rodrignc/ said in the leltei.
Stanford students had mixed feelings
about the end of the grapes I ><»\< oil.
