Only moments after defeating San Francisco
State on Sunday night, Casey Jacobsen's mind
turned to his upcoming Thanksgiving break — usu
ally known as a time for cold weather, turkey and
football.
"I've got to go pack my swim trunks," joked
sophomore Jacobsen.
Might not be a bad idea. While the rest of the
Stanford student body heads back home ibis week,
the men's basketball team ships out to sunny San
Juan to take part in the annual eight-team Puerto
Rico Shootout preseason tournament.
"I don't know about anybody else on the team,
bin it'll be nice to finally get oil campus after being
hereon campus fora while," Jacobsen said. "It'll be
a breath of fresh air. Road trips are real fun, and we
all look lonvard to them."

The Utes are the only other ranked team in the
tournament and are led by never-boring coach Rick
Majerus. The coach, who has one of the most in
sightful minds in college basketball, did not make the
trip with his team after complications from knee
surgery have kept him from flying.

ment more interesting for the (Cardinal.
Memphis enters its first year under the control of
coach John ('.alipari, the architect of'Massachusetts's
brief rise into the basketball elite in the early 1990s .
A team that defeated Stanford twice in the NCAA
tournament. Calipari has one great player in power
forward Kelly Wise, and given his track record, an
upset wouldn't be out of the question.
Majerus's I tali teams are always tough, and this
season he lias his best squad since the Utes' 1998
Final Four run when St an lord nearly advanced to
play Utah in the national championship game.
Talented small forward Britten Johnsen, coming
back from a Mormon mission, will be a tough
matchup on the wings, while speedy point guard
Travis Spivey should give Stanford senior point
guard Mike McDonald all lie can handle in the back
court.
For the (iardinal, the big question will be whether
Mc Donald will gel the same sort of open looks in
Puerto Rico that he goi in the opener against San
Francisco State.
McDonald made five consecutive 3-point shots in
the iii si eight minutes against the Gators and fin
ished with a career-high 19 points in the game —
heady numbers from a player who isn't known for
his scoring.
"We said to Mike, I here's no reason not to make
open shots. You're a good shooter,' head coach
Mike Montgomery said.
"We si ill want our point guard thinking in terms
of running the [oflense]. I le's not going to be open
all that much, but to be able to hit open shots is criti
cal, and there's no reason he can't do that."
On the injury front, redshirt freshman Justin
Davis's abdominal pull doesn't seem to be improv
ing, and Montgomery ruled him out of action for at
least the next two weeks.
The rest of the team is fairly healthy, although
Curtis Borchardt still isn't all the way back from his
loot injur) and Jason (ollins's knees continue to nag
him every week. Both will play in Puerto Rico.
