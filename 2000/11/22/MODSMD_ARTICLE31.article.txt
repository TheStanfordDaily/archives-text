### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
This Thanksgiving weekend,
ilie Stanford women's basketball
team is grateful to have two more
contests on its home court.
I he Cardinal (1-1) struggled
in its opener at St. Mary's Friday
falling to the Caels. However,
the Cardinal redeemed itscll at
home Monday in a rout ol Santa
Clara.
With a stretch of lour home
games in the next week and half,
including games against St.
Joseph's (1 -0) and the University
of the Pacific (1-0) this weekend,
the Cardinal looks to get into a
winning groove before return
ing to the road for some tough
December match-ups.
"Its so early right now," said
head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"I'd like the opportunity to look
at people in game situations in
stead of always just seeing them
in practice."
VanDerveer heads into this
weekend just two wins shy of her
500 th career college victory.
Two wins this weekend would
give the three-time National
Coach of the Year the bragging
rights that go with the impres
sive milestone.
Stanford faces St. Joseph's to
morrow nitflu in the second

meeting between the two
schools.
Last year the ('.at (final battled
the squad in Philadelphia and
suffered a catastrophic 09-41
loss.
I lawks center Jana 1 jclmero
va destroyed the Cardinal, scor
ing 25 points inside.
While Lic hnerova has grad
uated, St. Joseph's has some
other weapons th.it will pro
vide a tough test for the Stan
ford defense.
Senior guard Angela Zampel
la, who scorched through the
1 lawks opener, netting 20 points
in their win over Pennsylvania, is
the main threat.
Zampella pilots a young
Hawks squad that, like the Car
dinal, has two freshmen in its
starting ranks.
In addition to Zampella, ju
niors |ane Meade and Susan
Moran bring strong offensive
presence and are capable of
using their experience to come
up big for the I lawks.
()n Sunday Stanford takes on
l ()P (1-0). The Tigers return
four starters from a squad that
went 18-11 a year ago.
Senior forward Millie Kimp
ton leads HOP coming off a 25-
point performance in the Tigers
narrow 74-71 win over Sacra
mento Slate.

In both games ilr- keys for the
Cardinal remain tough defense
and strong presence on the
b< >ards.
While Stanford lias shot well
this season, the team has lost the
rebound battle in both ol its first
games.
11 lis quick stretch of home
games will give the Cardinal an
opportunity to settle into a solid,
competitive style of play.
Willi live freshmen getting
minutes on this year's squad, it is
no wonder that the team still has
a lew things io figure out.
But Van Dei veer is excited
about the depth this year's com
bination of recruits and experi
ence bring to the stacked Cardi
nal lineup.
She has been starting differ
ent players every night and looks
to continue the trend through
out the weekend.
"I don't have a rotation in
mind. If people can come in and
do well, playing defense and
grabbing rebounds, they will
play," said Van I Hi veer.
Regardless of who steps up
for the Cardinal, the team
hopes to add two more home
victories to its platter this holi
day weekend and in the process
add VanDerveer's name to the
prestigious list of 500-game
winners.
