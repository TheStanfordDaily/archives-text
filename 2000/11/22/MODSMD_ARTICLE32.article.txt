# Young wrestlers ready for battle

### KIMBERLY ROBERTS 
"Rebuilding" is certainly not t lie right adjective to
describe the Stanford wrestling team this season;
"young but talented" however, does seem quite suit
able lor the squad.
Due to the loss of a number of key starters, tlie
team will be looking to an exceptional pool of fresh
talent and the guidance of a (ore ol promising re
turners for success.
"We have a freshman (lass of future All-Ameri
cans, probably our best recruiting ( lass in history, but
most of these athletes will redshirt this season," said
assistant coach Steve Buddie.
"They've raised the expectation in our wrestling
room, even made our upperclassmen change the way
they set their goals. So, while our team will likely take
some lumps throughout the season, we have a strong
attitude."
In the It) Division I weight classes, the Cardinal's
starting line-up has two true freshmen, one red shirt
freshman, five sophomores and two juniors. Never
theless, the Cardinal is very deep, with .is many as
three wrestlers competing for the starting spot in
each ( lass.
In its first meet, the squad squared oil against San
Francisco State last Tuesday. It cruised to a 20-12 vic
tory over the Gators, posting two pins by junior
Harold Penson and freshman Nathan Peterson.
The first true test for the young squad (ame when
they travelled to the California Open at Cal State
Fullerton this past weekend. Four wrestlers placed in
the top three and freshman Brad Met/ler finished
third in the 133-pound weight ( lass.
Next on tap for the team is a four-malt h stretch in
the Pacific Northwest. There they will take on the
University of the Pacific, Portland State. ()regon State
and ()regon in the span of three days. This is a crucial
trip for the Cardinal as Oregon and Oregon State
both have top-20 programs and will be challenging
tests for the young squad.
"On paper, we are probably not favored to beat
Oregon or Oregon State, but if our team wrestles up
to its potential, we could very well surprise a lot of
people," Buddie said.

"()verall, ilit* four squads we're wrestling span the
gamut of talent and so it 'll be a great gauge lor us."
I he* key loss for the team is the graduation ofZach
Zimmererer, who helped lead the team to an overall
record of 4-5 last season and a seventh-place finish at
the Pacific 10 Conference finals.
Not only did he win the All-California ()pen at (lal
State Fullerton and the Pac-10 championship in the
133-pound weight division last season, but he was the
first wrestler in Stanford history to qualify for NCAA
finals in four consecutive years.
Leading the team in wins thus far this season has
been 133-pound sophomore Justin Walker. The
squad will also look to the returning Penson, who
won four mate lies in his freshman campaign, to make
key contributions in the 184-pound weight class and
take a strong leadership role.
Inspiration will come from head coach Chris Hor
pel, now in his 22nd year as the Cardinal head coach
and captains junior Levi VVeikel-Magden and sopho
more Brad Shelby.
Also joining the team is female wrestler Patricia
Miranda, a junior. She was the silver medalist at the
2000 women's world championships and will com
pete in the men's 125-pound weight ( lass this season.
She is one of the country's best female wrestlers and
will be looking for her first win on the men's side of
the sport.
Only four of the standard Pacific 10 teams are in
wrestling's version of the conference. Stanford, Ari
zona Slate, Oregon and Oregon State are joined by
Cal State-Fullerton, Cal State-Bakersfield, Boise
State, UC-Davis. Portland State and Cal Poly.
Wrestling is an individual sport, but the results of
the individual bouts all compile the team score. In a
conference like Stanford's, the team element of the
sport is the most important lor each and every mem
ber ol the squad.
"There is a huge importance of the team chemistry
element in wrestling," said Buddie.
"()ur team chemistry this year has made a young
team feel like they can go with the best wrestlers in the
Pac-10 lhe atmosphere in our wrestling room has
been very inspirational and positive and we're exited
fora great season."
