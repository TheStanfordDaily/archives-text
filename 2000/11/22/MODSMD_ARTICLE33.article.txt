NKW YORK (AP) — Stanford Hall of
Famer John McEnroe was intent on restoring
the lost glory ol tlie Davis Cup in the I nited
States when lie became captain ol the Ameri
can team.
Fourteen months later, he quit.
)ohu leels so passionate about Davis Cup
and lie is a perfectionist." I .S. I en 11 is Associ
ation president |ud\ Levering sai< 1 Monday.
"I le's disappointed with himself."
Ills captaino started off strong. I he day
he was selected, he received a call from Andre
Agassi, then ranked No. 1, saying he wanted
to play I htvis (lup.
Although McEnroe had to plead, I'ete
Sampras came aboard, giving the I nited
States a powerful 1-2 punch.
It never really happened.
Sampras tailed in sick for the lirst round
against Zimbabwe. And although both plavcd
against the C/ech Republic, the Americans
had to win the final two matches to advance to
the semifinals — on cla\ in Spain.
Sampras and Agassi begged off because of
injuries, leaving McEnroe with a last-minute

team that included Vince Spadea, who earlier
in the year set a record for consecutive losses.
"Either it's bad luck or I haven't made a dif
ference," McEnroe said in Spain. "I'm not
sure what 11 is at this point. Obviously one of
the reasons I was hired was so that I would
make a difference in getting the players to
play. Well, I clearly haven't succeeded. I'd
like to think it's bad luck."
Spain swept all five matches, the lirst time
in 101 years of Davis Cup play the United
Slates was beaten f>-0 without the title 011 the
line.
Personally, I think th.it he was angry
about Sampras and Agassi," Spanish captain
Javier Dual tc said of Mc Enroe. "It's a difficult
situation, but I think he is feeling awful for
that. Perhaps more than the defeat."
McEnroe had enough four months later.
M< Enroe told Levering ol Ins decision over
lunch in New York earh last week before lie
left for Frankfurt, Cernianv, lor a seniors
tournament.
"We weren't prepared to make a statement
then." Levering said. "We didn't want the

perception i<> be he and I were at odds, so we
decided to make a joint announcement.
"We pretty much had the announcement
on Saturday. I asked to delay it until alter the
Chase Championships. I didn't think it was
right to make the announcement at someone
else's event."
M< Kll roe dec lined to comment alter beat
ing I lenri Feconte (>-1. (i-3 in the final of the
seniors lour event in Frankfurt on Monday.
Ik'fbre the US FA announcement, he also re
fused to < omment when contacted at his hotel
In I he Associated Press.
"I was privileged to have been selected and
honored to have served as captain," McEnroe
said in a statement released by the I S FA.
"I nlbi innately, lor a variety of reasons I was
disappointed that I was unable i<> have a great
impact as captain of the team."
Fevering disagreed.
"1 leel lie had a terrific impact and brought
attention to Davis Cup, not only in the I'nited
States lint around the world," she said. "In the
two lies we won, I'm convinced n was because
of John."
