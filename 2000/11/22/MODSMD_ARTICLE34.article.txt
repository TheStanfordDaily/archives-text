school that thrives on such high intensitv but
the excitement of cycling has yet to spread
throughout campus. Nevertheless, team
members love the exhilarating sport.
"Going last through turns, bumping el

to f>() miles an hour downhill is simply amaz

Stanford cycling seizes on this excite

continues to improve. A conference title
would create even more momentum for the*
rising program.
