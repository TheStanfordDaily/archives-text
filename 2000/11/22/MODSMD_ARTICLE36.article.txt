Willi cameras flashing around him,
Oussama Khatib moved his hand on a
small joystick-like knob, causing a large ro
botic arm to emulate the motion of his
hand.
1 fere on the first floor of the Gales (lom
puter Science Building, Khatib, a professor
of computer science and head of the Stan
lord Robotic Manipulation Group, was
demonstrating the latest advances in ro
botics lo a group of visiting high school
teachers from Bermuda.
I he visitors were awed time after time
as Khatib gave demonstrations of his
newest toys. Even Computer Science
Prol. Eric Roberts, who was leading the
teachers around and who had probabK
seen many of the demonstrations before,
was fascinated.
After the demonstration, Khatib dis
cussed recent innovations in robotics, no
tably in the area of haptics.
Haptics is a sub-field of robotics thai
deals with mechanic ally simulated physical
feedback that will c ause the user of a robot
ic system lo "feel." For example, in one
demonstration on the first floor of Gates,
the user can manipulate a metal knob to
move a ball around several polygons on a
computer screen. The user feels resistance
from the metal tip that simulates how il
would feel if the user were physically mov
ing his lingers around polygons. When the
user moves the computer ball around a
cylinder, the user's fingers can leel the
smooth surface of the cylinder. When he
moves the ball around an octagon, lie feels
the ridge at each corner of the octagon.
According to Khatib, advances in the
three-dimensional computer graphics en
vironment, as well as the natural maturity
of research in the field of haptics, have

come together to cre
ate some promising
developments within
the last five years.
Kenneth Salis
bury, a professor in
computer science
and co-director of
the Center for Ad
vanced 1 ethnology
in Surgery at Stan
ford, noted, "The
advent of haptic in
terface technologies
in the last five years
have inspired people
[to come up with
new ways to use this
technology]."
Khatib envisions
the day when haptics
technology will be
advanced enough for
astronauts lo be able
lo train doing con
struction work in
space. Astronauts will
be using simulated
tools and materials
that feel as if they
were being used in
space. Or, for that
matter, what il an as
tronaut could control
a robot In feeling the
same forces as the
robot?
While such so
phisticated systems
may not exisi fora
long while, haptic

technology will soon he used in medicine.
Groups ill Stanford have been working to
create haptic simulations so that doctors
c an train by doing mock surgeries.

Already, companies such as H I Med
ical Systems, located in (laithersburg,
Maryland, have developed haptic systems
where nurses can train lot putting

catheters into arms
lor intravenous fluid
injections. A trainee
applies a catheter to a
rubber arm. The
catheter is attached
to a mechanical sys
tem that simulates
the pressure that the
trainee would feel if
he were indeed in
jecting the catheter
into a real arm. ()n a
computer screen, he
can also see the arm
as il would look with
the catheter being
applied.
Stanford's Cen
ter for Advanced
Technology in
Surgery is also at
tempting to simulate
the feel of soli tissue
using haptics. Even
tually, doctors will be
able to simulate per
forming endoscopic
surgeries. Endoscop
ic surgeries are surg
eries performed non
invasively; instead,
small holes are drilled
into the site of the
surgery. This type of
surgery minimizes
patient recovery time.
Salisbury de
scribed two models
for emulating the feel
of soft tissue currently

being perfected.
One is the "spring and math" model.
Soft tissue is simulated on the computer
using several virtual weighted balls that art

connected to each other through a series of
springs. Depending on the tissue being
simulated, the weight <>l the balls and the
elasticities of the springs are adjusted to ac
count for differences in each human
organ.
Another model is the "volumetric
model, where human tissue and organs are
simulated by many little virtual blobs put
together. Kacli blob is like- )ell-C), and has
its elasticity and weight preset l>\ the com
puter so that it ac ts like a little piece of the
appropriate organ.
There are several problems with apply
ing these techniques, however. Francois
Conti, a doctoral student in computer sci
ence and a member ol Khatib's group, ex
plained that it was difficult to compute
what elasticities these little springs or blobs
should be set at without testing them with a
real organ.
While organs removed from humans
have been used for testing, (lonti noted, "A
dead liver isn't like a real liver.'' He said
that, when touched or manipulated, dead
samples react differently from live organs.
Accurately simulating the texture of soft
tissue in real time is another problem that
researchers face. Simulating the feel ol
polygon edges is one thing; simulating live
tissue is quite another.
Nevertheless, Salisbury is confident that
these obstacles are onl\ temporal*) and
cautiously predicted th.it an evaluation
stage endoscopic singer) trainer will be
possible in four or five years.
Kliatib is also excited about future
prospects in the field. "Haptics one of
those projects that bring people in from
medicine, computer science, biomec han
ics." With the development of the Bio-X
program at Stanford, he sees progress ac -
celerating in the next few vears.
