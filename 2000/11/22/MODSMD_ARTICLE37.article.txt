manufacturers, including Dell,
Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and
IBM, are expected to start releasing
products next week using two ver
sions of the Pentium 4 chip — one
that runs at 1.4 gigahertz and .in
other at 1.5 gigahertz.. Although
Intel would not disclose the cost <>l
the Pentium 4 chips, industry
sourtes peg the price ol the 1.4 gi
gahertz chip at about $(>5O and the
1.5 gigahertz chip in the range ol
$800.
1977

The year that director (ieorge
Lucas released "Star Wars: A New
Hope" featuring the lovable R2-
1)2, Luke Skywalker's utility droid.
Squat and barrel-shaped, R2-D2
communicates electronically in a
limited vocabulary of beeps and
whist It's. R2-1 )2 is designee 11( > < >per
ate in deep space, interfacing with
fighter craft and computer systems
to augment the capabilities ol ships
and their pilots, usually from a
socket behind the cockpit. R2-D2
monitors and diagnoses flight per
formance, maps and stores hyper
space data, and pinpoints technical
errors.

2000
The year that Helen Greiner
creates the ißobot. the first wireless,
Web-controlled robot, inspired by
R2-D2. The 45-pound ißobot hasa
digital video camera and a built-in
sonar to help avoid obstacles. It also
has a microphone and speakers,
through which the operator both
listens and speaks. A Web browser
enables it to be controlled Irom any
where in the world; Irom within the
room, ißobot functions by remote
control. ißobot runs on the Linux
operating system and isa fully func
tional computer. A battery fuels it
for about one hour, after which it
can be recharged by steering it to a
( barging station. The ißobot wire
lessly connects to the Internet at
700 Klips and requires a lull-time
Internet connection providing 300
Klips of outgoing bandwidth or
more.

louted as the most fully featured
electronic book to date, the cßook

touchscreen panel, audio-record
ing and built-in address and phone
books. I he eßookman can also play
audio books. A multimedia card slot
allows users to expand the unit as
more features liecome available.
