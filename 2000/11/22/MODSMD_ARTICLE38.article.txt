# Biotech problems proliferate

### BRANNEN McELMURRAY 
Information Technology and
biotechnology will be critical in
shaping the future of the I S.
economy. While Information
Technology and biotechnology
often fall under the shared rubric
of the "tec hnological revolution,"
biotechnology presents vastly dif
ferent regulatory challenges. I he
deliberate world of biotechnology
stands in stark contrast to the free
wheeling virtual reality of the
"Wild Wild Web."
Biotechnology efforts demand
higher startup costs than Internet
based companies due to facility
costs, equipment, personnel, ad
ministrative structure and regula
tory burden. The history of
biotechnology lacks sua ess stories
of entrepreneurs with home
chemistry sets creating innovative
products in their garage.
While Internet technology re
lics on incremental innovations,
biotechnology depends on break
through discoveries. Because they
use this model, biotechnology
companies are likely to develop
next-generation products.
The biotechnology industry is
exposed to unbounded liability
because its products inherently
create physical consequences.
But these consequences can
also be helpful to society. Many
biotechnology firms are engaged
in developing new looclsand med
icines, which are public goods.
I llese goods require an active
governmental product approval
process. Our current regulatory
scheme, tlu- behavior of corpora
tions and the efforts of activists
threaten the biotechnology indus
try, perhaps our greatest engine of
innovation. Without clear public
policy direction, lawyers are medi
ating the divisive battles.
It started with faco Bell. In

mid-September ol this year, Ce
netic 11) Inc. discovered lhal a gro
cer)' store sold Kraft Taco Hell
shells containing Star Link, a type
ol genetically modified corn not
approved for human consump
tion. The discovery came after a
lawsuit was filed in Chicago on be
half of a man who claims to have
suffered an allergic reaction. Star-
Link was created by Aventis Crop

Science, a subsidiary of Aventis,
S.A. of France.
Star Link produces a biological
pesticide, or biopesticide. These
biopesticides can be developed
from the natural materials of cer
tain plants, animals and bacteria, as
in the case of Star Link. The Star-
Linkcom is engineered to produce
a protein toxic to the corn borer —
a pest that causes damage to crops.

lb create SlarLink, scientists in
serted a sequence of genes from the
bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis
(lit) into the nuclei of corn cells.
(brn cells incorporated the lit gene
sequence into their genetic axle.
Scientists harvested the plants that
expressed the gene's pest- killing
qualities and retained all other
physical qualities, causing them to
emulate the non-mcxlified plants.

In 1998, the Environmental
Protection Agency approved Star-
Link for animal feed and industri
al use but prohibited human con
sumption because of concerns
that Star Link may cause allergic
reactions. Tests conducted by the
EPA showed that Star Link has
similar characteristics to other al
lergy-causing foods, but the tests
were not definitive.

Responding to the discover)
ol StarLinkat 1 aco Bell, the Food
and Drug Administration re
called almost 300 types of tacos.

with Star Link.
Restaurants such as
Applebee's, Wendy's, Del I aco
and private-label brands such as
Safeway Inc., Kroger do.. Food
Lion and Wal-mart, Inc . were af

I he (lenter for I )isease (bntrol

investigating consumer com
plaints of adverse reactions to
Star Link.
We allow entrepreneurs
to settle the Web and shape its

low compared to the rewards.
On the Web, a likelv night

genetically modified crops
and garden plants enhanced

argue that synthetic chemicals
and naturally occurring toxins
are diflerent and that the EPA
policy needlesslv prolongs the use
of synthetic chemical pesticides,
increases the burden for develop
ers of pest-resistant crops and
hampers the I nited Stales' eco

Because main new plant varieties

will increase l<>od production in the

faster and produce larger yields.
Ihe I nited States has more

planted with geneticalK altered
crops including corn, sovbeans,

tomatoes and other produce.
Sources claim that 20 to lf> percent
of I .S. corn .ind soybeans are
grown from seed engineered to
produce biopesticides. The I SDA

pioneer in its field, plans to market

normally required.
Proponents of biotechnology

and the competitive advantage ol

of biotechnology out of necessity

opportunity. China grew the lirst
commercial genetically modified
crops by introducing a virus-resis
tant tobac co plant in 1098.
Recently, Monsanto introduced
a genetically altered cotton plant in
China, which dramatically reduces
the cost per acre of pesticides and
prevents worker deaths from over
exposure to the toxic chemical.
Since 1007, China has approved
the release of more than 100 genet
ically altered crops, double the
number released in the United
States. Already, several have en
tered the lood supplv through com
mercial production, including

tomatoes thai ripen more slowly
and virns-resisiani green peppers.
We need to deline I lie goals and

Biotechnology creates public
goods through the development of

At the public level, we need lo co

the safety testing and evaluation of
new genetically modified organ

Information Technology and
biotechnology will be critical in
shaping the future of the I S.
economy. While Information
Technology and biotechnology
often fall under the shared rubric
of the "tec hnological revolution,"
biotechnology presents vastly dif
ferent regulatory challenges. I he
deliberate world of biotechnology
stands in stark contrast to the free
wheeling virtual reality of the
"Wild Wild Web."
Biotechnology efforts demand
higher startup costs than Internet
based companies due to facility
costs, equipment, personnel, ad
ministrative structure and regula
tory burden. The history of
biotechnology lacks sua ess stories
of entrepreneurs with home
chemistry sets creating innovative
products in their garage.
While Internet technology re
lics on incremental innovations,
biotechnology depends on break
through discoveries. Because they
use this model, biotechnology
companies are likely to develop
next-generation products.
The biotechnology industry is
exposed to unbounded liability
because its products inherently
create physical consequences.
But these consequences can
also be helpful to society. Many
biotechnology firms are engaged
in developing new looclsand med
icines, which are public goods.
I llese goods require an active
governmental product approval
process. Our current regulatory
scheme, tlu- behavior of corpora
tions and the efforts of activists
threaten the biotechnology indus
try, perhaps our greatest engine of
innovation. Without clear public
policy direction, lawyers are medi
ating the divisive battles.
It started with faco Bell. In

mid-September ol this year, Ce
netic 11) Inc. discovered lhal a gro
cer)' store sold Kraft Taco Hell
shells containing Star Link, a type
ol genetically modified corn not
approved for human consump
tion. The discovery came after a
lawsuit was filed in Chicago on be
half of a man who claims to have
suffered an allergic reaction. Star-
Link was created by Aventis Crop

Science, a subsidiary of Aventis,
S.A. of France.
Star Link produces a biological
pesticide, or biopesticide. These
biopesticides can be developed
from the natural materials of cer
tain plants, animals and bacteria, as
in the case of Star Link. The Star-
Linkcom is engineered to produce
a protein toxic to the corn borer —
a pest that causes damage to crops.

lb create SlarLink, scientists in
serted a sequence of genes from the
bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis
(lit) into the nuclei of corn cells.
(brn cells incorporated the lit gene
sequence into their genetic axle.
Scientists harvested the plants that
expressed the gene's pest- killing
qualities and retained all other
physical qualities, causing them to
emulate the non-mcxlified plants.

In 1998, the Environmental
Protection Agency approved Star-
Link for animal feed and industri
al use but prohibited human con
sumption because of concerns
that Star Link may cause allergic
reactions. Tests conducted by the
EPA showed that Star Link has
similar characteristics to other al
lergy-causing foods, but the tests
were not definitive.
