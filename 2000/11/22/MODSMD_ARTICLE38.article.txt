# Biotech problems proliferate

Information Technology and
biotechnology will be critical in
shaping the future of the I S.
economy. While Information
Technology and biotechnology
often fall under the shared rubric
of the "tec hnological revolution,"
biotechnology presents vastly dif
ferent regulatory challenges. I he
deliberate world of biotechnology
stands in stark contrast to the free
wheeling virtual reality of the
"Wild Wild Web."
Biotechnology efforts demand
higher startup costs than Internet
based companies due to facility
costs, equipment, personnel, ad
ministrative structure and regula
tory burden. The history of
biotechnology lacks sua ess stories
of entrepreneurs with home
chemistry sets creating innovative
products in their garage.
While Internet technology re
lics on incremental innovations,
biotechnology depends on break
through discoveries. Because they
use this model, biotechnology
companies are likely to develop
next-generation products.
The biotechnology industry is
exposed to unbounded liability
because its products inherently
create physical consequences.
But these consequences can
also be helpful to society. Many
biotechnology firms are engaged
in developing new looclsand med
icines, which are public goods.
I llese goods require an active
governmental product approval
process. Our current regulatory
scheme, tlu- behavior of corpora
tions and the efforts of activists
threaten the biotechnology indus
try, perhaps our greatest engine of
innovation. Without clear public
policy direction, lawyers are medi
ating the divisive battles.
It started with faco Bell. In

mid-September ol this year, Ce
netic 11) Inc. discovered lhal a gro
cer)' store sold Kraft Taco Hell
shells containing Star Link, a type
ol genetically modified corn not
approved for human consump
tion. The discovery came after a
lawsuit was filed in Chicago on be
half of a man who claims to have
suffered an allergic reaction. Star-
Link was created by Aventis Crop

Science, a subsidiary of Aventis,
S.A. of France.
Star Link produces a biological
pesticide, or biopesticide. These
biopesticides can be developed
from the natural materials of cer
tain plants, animals and bacteria, as
in the case of Star Link. The Star-
Linkcom is engineered to produce
a protein toxic to the corn borer â€”
a pest that causes damage to crops.

lb create SlarLink, scientists in
serted a sequence of genes from the
bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis
(lit) into the nuclei of corn cells.
(brn cells incorporated the lit gene
sequence into their genetic axle.
Scientists harvested the plants that
expressed the gene's pest- killing
qualities and retained all other
physical qualities, causing them to
emulate the non-mcxlified plants.

In 1998, the Environmental
Protection Agency approved Star-
Link for animal feed and industri
al use but prohibited human con
sumption because of concerns
that Star Link may cause allergic
reactions. Tests conducted by the
EPA showed that Star Link has
similar characteristics to other al
lergy-causing foods, but the tests
were not definitive.

Responding to the discover)
ol StarLinkat 1 aco Bell, the Food
and Drug Administration re
called almost 300 types of tacos.
tortillas, tostadas and < hips made
with Star Link.
Restaurants such as
Applebee's, Wendy's, Del I aco
and private-label brands such as
Safeway Inc., Kroger do.. Food
Lion and Wal-mart, Inc . were af
fected by the rec all. I he Food
and Drug Administration and
I he (lenter for I )isease (bntrol
and Prevention are currentl\
investigating consumer com
plaints of adverse reactions to
Star Link.
We allow entrepreneurs
to settle the Web and shape its
domain because the risks arc
low compared to the rewards.
On the Web, a likelv night
mare scenario is lhai you pay
too much on e-ba\ for some
thing you don't need and,
after receiving it in the mail,
you don't want it, <>i the prod
uct doesn't work and you < an't
return it. The clangers I,icing
e-commerce are not as dire as
the global consequences of
biotechnology. A problem on
the Web c an cause Insi monev.
A problem in biotechnolog\
can cause losl lives.
I lie KPA's p<>!i<\ treats
genetically modified crops
and garden plants enhanced
for pest or disease resistance
as pesticides. But opponents
argue that synthetic chemicals
and naturally occurring toxins
are diflerent and that the EPA
policy needlesslv prolongs the use
of synthetic chemical pesticides,
increases the burden for develop
ers of pest-resistant crops and
hampers the I nited Stales' eco
nomic interests.
