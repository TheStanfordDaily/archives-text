# Our scientific connection to the world

### ALAN LEE 
You've seen the situation hundreds of
times. You're slouched over in your seat
looking deader than Ralph Nader's cam
paign while your friend fidgets furiously
trying to keep his hist few brain cells from
dving of boredom.
Yep, you've guessed it. You are in one
of those classes that was devised bv a select
group of scientific geniuses who must have
thought that free time and sleep were
overrated.
1 understand why people gel bored
with science classes more often than they
do with other courses: We rarely find out
how the material relates to our lives.
Well, if you were thrown into a furnace
room bv terrorists with a rod iron, a chunk
ol graphite and a tub of water, and your
survival depended on opening a door that
could onl\ be- broken clown with marten
sitic steel, vou could whip out vour knowl

edge of phase transformations, heat the
iron with the carbon, dunk it in the water
and break down the door.
But your life probably doesn't involve
strangers trying to do vou in (unless, of
course, you go to (lal).
What people want to know is how all
this stuff about the fundamental principles
of sc ienc e applies to our normal everyday
life. So here it is.
The fundamental law of nature influ
ences our daily lives, and sometimes the
results are scary. Have you ever noticed
how many bike accidents there are on
campus?
Contrary to popular belief, this is not
merely due to the poor na\ igation skills ol
Stanford students. No, the deeper under
lying physical reason whv Stanford stu
dents c an t steer worth beans is because of
Kinstein's theory of gravitation.
Ac cording to his theory, all mass warps
space in a way that curves it slightlv, caus

ing gravitational attraction. As a result,
the increase in mass that a Stanford stu
dent gains because of his bike causes an
attractive force with another biker which
inevitably ends up in somebody kissing
asphalt.
In fact, if you took away all the build
ings and people and the two people were
traveling away from each other, the attrac
tive pull would be so great that they would
turn and eventually hit each other any
way.
I lave you ever had one of those classes
where the more energy you put into
studying lor the exams, the worse you
seem to do in the class? Well, it's not your
fault â€” Heisenberg's uncertainty princi
ple is to blame.
I lie principle states that the change in
energy times the c hange in time is about
equal to a number so incredibly small that,
when it was first discovered by Max
Planck, lie c alled it the "holy crud that's a

small number!!" constant.
Due to issues of censorship in scientific
literature, however, it was eventually
changed to "holy crucl" and then simply
"h," and finally "Planck's constant."
So. basically, the more energy you put
into studying for this exam, the less time
you have to take it. Some students have
tried to use this law to their advantage by
not putting any energy into studying at all.
Of course, if you choose this route, all
the time in the world wouldn't help you,
and the time you spend taking the test is
more painful than a dental visit to Dr.
Kevorkian.
The connection between science and
everyday events doesn't just stop at school;
it permeates our personal lives as well.
So il you fall asleep in the middle of
physics and start dreaming about being a
superhero Hying through spate, defying
gravity, don't feel guilty. You're just ap
plying w hat you've learned.
