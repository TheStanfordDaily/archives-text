utes. county officials announced
they would join adjacent Broward
County in reviewing hundreds of
thousands ol ballots In hand.

and Vice President Al Gore, the
ruling was <i victory fbi the vice
president, who had pressed for
manual recounts in four counties
in hopes of overturning the Texas
governor's 300-vote lead. About
2,(>00 overseas absentee ballots re

Lewis had ruled earlier in the week that
while I larris could enforce the state's one
week deadline for filing vote tallies, she

had flexibility in deciding whethet some
counties might need more time.
I larris contributed to delays in getting
the counts done, and then punished the
counties for not finishing on time, Gore
lawyer Dexter Douglass argued.
"It's like when .1 police ollicer says stop,
and a line of cars backs up behind
you . . . and then he gives you a ticket for

A lawyer fin' I lan is. Joe Klock, said she
acted scrupuloush to follow Florida law
and Lewis' order.
"Rather than violating the order of this
court, we paid particulai attention to fol
lowing the orders ol this court,' he ar
gued.
Both campaigns also awaited word
from a federal appeals court that has
agreed to heat Mush's < onstitutional chal
lenge to the recounts.
Bush asked the I 1111 I .S. (lire nil (.ourt
of Appeals to stop the hand counts pend
ing a ruling on whether ilie\ violate vot
ers' lights to be treated equally under the
law. I lis lawyers warned that Americans
are witnessing the "disintegration' ol the

Bush losi that argument Monday lie
lore a federal judge in Miami.
" I his ( ase is sinipl) not appropriate for
federal court intervention of any kind at
this point in the proceeding," Gore's
lawyers replied in the appeals case.
I he Bush c amp saws hand recounts are
prone to error and treat voters dillerenlly
based on where tlies live. I he I Ith Circuit
also is considering a related appeal In Bre
