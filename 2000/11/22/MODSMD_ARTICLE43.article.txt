# Startup incubators need resuscitation
## 
### 
BOSTON (AP) — They were sup
posed to help e-commerce sites up oil
the ground, nurturing them with sound
advice, and then unloading them at a
profit. Hut these days, Internet incuba
tors could use a hand up themselves.
Recent weeks have seen waves of
doi.com closings, and incubators — who
often hold slakes iu many dot.corns —
are suffering:
Ando\ ei -based CMCI, whose port fo
lio inc hide scan li engine /Vita Vista and
retailers such as IManeiOutdoors.com,
saw lis stock plunge from $!('>!s.so early
this yeai to the $ 1 1 range this past week.
I lie (ompain losi $('>('> ) million last
quarter.
Shares of Divine Inierventures Inc., a
( In* ago-based iik übalor in which (IM(if
lias a."> peicent slake, have also crashed,
from Sl 2 to under $2. I he company was
criticized for investing 100 much 100
quicklv, and lor a talented but cumber
some 11-person board beset by conflicts
of interest.
Ideal.ib, a prominent Pasadena, Calif
bascd in< übalor thai raised $1 billion in
private funding, lias abandoned a
planned initial public slock offering.
I hose iiK übators still alloal say they'll
sun ivc. "lis jnsi part of the life of being
a holding companv, said Divine
founder Andrew lilipowski. "(Incuba
tors) are looking worse than they were

doing six months or eight months ago,
but that doesn't mean they're doing
poorly."
1 no balors grew by finding compa
nies with promising business ideas but
that simply lacked a key ingredient or
two — office space, or technical or legal
help, for example. They supplied ihe
missing elements and often invested in
the new companies. Many entrepre
neurs say working with an incubator
helped.
"It allowed me to raise money, to
hone the business strategy. to gel in front
of customers ... as opposed to dealing
with the rent, the office space, the ac
counting system." said Alpei Caglayan,
who started bis fourth company, Peo
pleSireet.com, with ihe help of Cam
bridge Incubator.
Others sav incubators offered them
clients in other "incubatees" and helped
litem acquire other companies and re
cruit talent. And perhaps most impor
tantly, they simply showed more interest
than the typical venture capitalist.
" I hese guys are really interested in
helping us," said Deepak Verma, execu
tive vice president for corporate devel
opment lor e-creclit.com, a financial ser
vices company fore-businesses that is ,'i()
percent-owned by Internet Capital
(iroup. "It's not like other investors who
invest and if you need help you go to

them. They're sitting clown with us,
strategizing with us."
But many experts say the inc übatees
are kidding themselves and really got lit
tle of value.
"Strong companies already have what
the incubators provide," said John De
laney, a partner and co-head of new
media practice group at Morrison and
Foerster, a law firm in New York. "They
already have strong managerial skills
and <i good business plan, and they 're al
ready attracting venture capital," he
said.
When Boris Docevski was starling
ellMO.com, a Web site aiming to help
the insurance industry cut clown on pa
perwork, he never really considered en
listing the help of an Internet incubator.
"We kind of had the feeling that incu
bators hatch startups on a wholesale
basis," he said. " I hat wasn't something
that appealed to us. Our idea is some
thing that is very industry specific and
not something everyone out there in the
Internet business would appreciate."
Instead, he went through a more tra
ditional venture capital firm and recent
ly secured a second round of funding.
Michael I reacv, cofounder and chiel
strategist for Ccn.'i Partners in Boston
— which, like many companies, eschews
the term "incubator" — said many in
cubators also simply made bad invest

ment dec isions about which companies
to incubate.
"This is not the A-team from the ven
ture capital community that has been
doing this," said Treaty, a former profes
sor at the Sloan School of Management at
the Massachusetts Institute of I eclmolo
gy. "This in fact has been people who have
been outside the private capital business,
trying to get in."
Incubators have been hurt In the re
cent wave of dot.com failures. Idealab
companies like Kve.com recently an
nounced layoffs, and another, Modo.net,
fired its 84 employees the day before its
scheduled launch patty. CMCI has an
nounced it would c lose iCast on-line en
tertainment and Ist Up Internet-access
— unless buyers for the units could be
found.
And CMCI itsell has laid off hundreds
of employees since the spring, although it
said it still has over $1 billion in cash and
securities.
"Everyone is entitled to be a Monday
morning quarterback," Divine's l il
ipowski said, but he contended that com
panies like his aren't dead yet.
"Most ol the wealth is actually created
at the down end of the consolidation
c ycle," lie said. "That's when the Rocke
fellers consolidated Standard 0i1...
I hat's where the wealth is going to be
made here, when people consolidate at

pennies on ihe dollar."
Thai's the route Filipowski — who lias
insisted that Divine isn't an inc übator hut
a "digital holding company" — wants to
take, lie recently announced that Divine
would gel out of the startup-launching
business and focus on acquiring and con
solidating established businesses.
The idea of the incubator is evolving
in other ways. The lines between incuba
tors and venture capitalists will continue
to blur. Another trend is the "captive in
cubator," or an incubator set up within
an established company to develop new
businesses.
Charles Rut stein, a research analyst at
Forrester Research in Cambridge, said
the formula lias worked well for compa
nies like (hipmaker Intel, which is back
ing companies that make live-audio and
video conferencing technology. Both re
quire high processing speeds, and their
success would fuel demand for Intel's
chips.
Captive incubators also help compa
nies retain their best talent b\ giving
them exciting projects to work on, said
Alvi Abuaf, vice president and founder ol
the incubator unit of Cap Cemini Ernst
and Young in New York.
"You need to come up with a wav of
stemming that brain drain and keeping
whatever value that was rightfully theirs
from going out," he said.

BOSTON (AP) — They were sup
posed to help e-commerce sites up oil
the ground, nurturing them with sound
advice, and then unloading them at a
profit. Hut these days, Internet incuba
tors could use a hand up themselves.
Recent weeks have seen waves of
doi.com closings, and incubators — who
often hold slakes iu many dot.corns —
are suffering:
Ando\ ei -based CMCI, whose port fo
lio inc hide scan li engine /Vita Vista and
retailers such as IManeiOutdoors.com,
saw lis stock plunge from $!('>!s.so early
this yeai to the $ 1 1 range this past week.
I lie (ompain losi $('>('> ) million last
quarter.
Shares of Divine Inierventures Inc., a
( In* ago-based iik übalor in which (IM(if
lias a."> peicent slake, have also crashed,
from Sl 2 to under $2. I he company was
criticized for investing 100 much 100
quicklv, and lor a talented but cumber
some 11-person board beset by conflicts
of interest.
Ideal.ib, a prominent Pasadena, Calif
bascd in< übalor thai raised $1 billion in
private funding, lias abandoned a
planned initial public slock offering.
I hose iiK übators still alloal say they'll
sun ivc. "lis jnsi part of the life of being
a holding companv, said Divine
founder Andrew lilipowski. "(Incuba
tors) are looking worse than they were

doing six months or eight months ago,
but that doesn't mean they're doing
poorly."
1 no balors grew by finding compa
nies with promising business ideas but
that simply lacked a key ingredient or
two — office space, or technical or legal
help, for example. They supplied ihe
missing elements and often invested in
the new companies. Many entrepre
neurs say working with an incubator
helped.
"It allowed me to raise money, to
hone the business strategy. to gel in front
of customers ... as opposed to dealing
with the rent, the office space, the ac
counting system." said Alpei Caglayan,
who started bis fourth company, Peo
pleSireet.com, with ihe help of Cam
bridge Incubator.
Others sav incubators offered them
clients in other "incubatees" and helped
litem acquire other companies and re
cruit talent. And perhaps most impor
tantly, they simply showed more interest
than the typical venture capitalist.
" I hese guys are really interested in
helping us," said Deepak Verma, execu
tive vice president for corporate devel
opment lor e-creclit.com, a financial ser
vices company fore-businesses that is ,'i()
percent-owned by Internet Capital
(iroup. "It's not like other investors who
invest and if you need help you go to

them. They're sitting clown with us,
strategizing with us."
But many experts say the inc übatees
are kidding themselves and really got lit
tle of value.
"Strong companies already have what
the incubators provide," said John De
laney, a partner and co-head of new
media practice group at Morrison and
Foerster, a law firm in New York. "They
already have strong managerial skills
and <i good business plan, and they 're al
ready attracting venture capital," he
said.
When Boris Docevski was starling
ellMO.com, a Web site aiming to help
the insurance industry cut clown on pa
perwork, he never really considered en
listing the help of an Internet incubator.
"We kind of had the feeling that incu
bators hatch startups on a wholesale
basis," he said. " I hat wasn't something
that appealed to us. Our idea is some
thing that is very industry specific and
not something everyone out there in the
Internet business would appreciate."
Instead, he went through a more tra
ditional venture capital firm and recent
ly secured a second round of funding.
Michael I reacv, cofounder and chiel
strategist for Ccn.'i Partners in Boston
— which, like many companies, eschews
the term "incubator" — said many in
cubators also simply made bad invest

ment dec isions about which companies
to incubate.
"This is not the A-team from the ven
ture capital community that has been
doing this," said Treaty, a former profes
sor at the Sloan School of Management at
the Massachusetts Institute of I eclmolo
gy. "This in fact has been people who have
been outside the private capital business,
trying to get in."
