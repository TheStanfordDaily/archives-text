lined the importance ol the t enters
and highlighted problems that they
have encountered throughout the
years as well as possible solutions.
"()ne ol the most important

points that the proposal makes is
that these centers provide an open
space for .ill students to gather to
gether to engage in the challenge
ol building diverse networks and
ultimately, community," said se

Students have expressed con
