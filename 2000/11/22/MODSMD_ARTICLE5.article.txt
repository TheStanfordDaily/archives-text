main problems that the proposal

and iniperniancnce.
Proposed solutions to these pi t >b

to all the centers; location of com

"Many of' Stanford programs and

Ftchemendy also addressed the
prohibition against community (en

" I hc inability to lundraise is a
common complaint," he said. " I lie

of the Stanlbrd community," re
sponded senior Tim Ly, who is in
volved with I he Haas Center and
Students lor Environmental Action
at Stanford.
Ktchemendy reiterated the im
portance of group fundraising.
"It irritates a lot of people, but
much more money can Ik- raised as
a whole than if every group and de
partment went out separately to
their own graduates," lie said.
Although the meeting's ultimate
outcome remains to Ik-seen, it was a
concrete step to making the coali
tion's issues known to the adminis
tration.
"1 Ktchemendy] knows we are se
rious, ,ind lie realizes the impor
tance of the centers," said senior
Ajamti'Kitwana after the meeting.
"We are willing to negotiate."
Although no commitment was

initially made by Etchemendy, a co
operative spirit between an impor
tant section of the Stanford commu
nity and the administration was ini
tiated, according to members of the
coalition.
"This is a friendly effort to work
together in uniting interpretations
to take action in common belief,"
said Elly Matsumura, a senior in
volved with the LGBTCC.
According to the student's pro
posal, "the community centers' aca
demic and social programming
heightens campus awareness about
how we define community and di
versity on campus, thus comple
menting the learning that takes
place within the traditional class
room setting."
"Through such work, the cen
ters support the development of
student leaders who enhance stu
dents' understanding of both
their own and each others' cul
tures and histories."
The coalition will meet again
