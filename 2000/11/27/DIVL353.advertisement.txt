"Kill those Jews and those Americans who are like them..."
"Have no mercy on the Jews, no matter where they are, in any country. Fight them, wherever you are. Wherever
you meet them, kill them. Wherever you are, kill those Jews and those Americans who are like them - and those
who stand by them - they are all in one trench, against the Arabs and the Muslims - because they established Israel
here, in the beating heart of the Arab world, in Palestine."
Dr. Ahmad Abu Halabiya, Member of the Palestinian Authority-appointed "Fatwa Council"and former acting
Rector of the Islamic University in Gaza, excerpted from a Friday sermon in the Zaved bin Sultan Aal Nahyan
mosque in Gaza, broadcast twice on the ojficia! Palestinian Authority television.
"... mothers cry with joy when they hear about their sons 1 death..."
"They willingly sacrifice their offspring for the sake of freedom. It is a great display of the power of belief. The moth
er is participating in the great reward of the Jihad to liberate Al-Aqsa. I talked to a young man. [who] said: '.1 want
to marry the black-eyed [beautiful] women of heaven.' The next day he became a martyr. 1 am sure his mother was
filled with joy about his heavenly marriage. Such a son must have such a mother"
Sheik 'Ikrima Sabri, the Arafat-appointed Mufti (religious leader) of Jerusalem and Palestine, excerpted from an
interview on Al-Ahram Al-Arabi (Egypt), October 28, 2000.
"IsraeVs days are numbered."
"The land of Palestine is not only Jerusalem; this land stretches from the [Jordan] River to the [Mediterranean] Sea
[all of present-day Israel]. Naturally, the [Palestinian] problem relates to all of this land. We cannot establish a home
land by only liberating Jerusalem. It is true that Salah Al-Din did not rest until Jerusalem was liberated, but this
not suggest that the rest of this blessed land is to be neglected or given up."
Sheik 'Ikrima Sabri, the Arafat appointed Mufti (religious leader) of Jerusalem and Palestine, excerpted from an
interview on Al-Ahram Al-Arabi (Egypt), October 28, 2000.
"We will turn ourselves into invisible bombs against [Israeli] soldiers..."
"We will turn ourselves into invisible bombs against [Israeli] soldiers. The blood will always defeat the sword. This
is human history."
Palestinian Authority Minister of Supplies, Abd Al-Aziz Shaheen, excerpted from Al-Hayat Al-Jadida,
October 8, 2000.

Israeli Response, from the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs
"We will leave no stone unturned in our attempt to achieve peace and security with
our Palestinian neighbors"
"We're trying to minimize bloodshed and to prevent a dangerous widening of confrontation. At Camp David we
were ready to contemplate far-reaching ideas raised by President Clinton. The Palestinians refused. Since then we
have been at Paris, Sharm el-Sheikh and Gaza, but the Palestinians failed to live up to their commitments. No
manipulation of the facts, no slick propaganda, can obscure this basic, simple truth....] Phis is our vision: we will
leave no stone unturned in our attempt to achieve peace and security with our Palestinian neighbors. But at the same
time we will protect our vital interests, our internal unity, and our standing in the world - if a violent confrontation
is imposed on us."
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, excerpted from remarks to the General Assembly of United Jewish Communities,
November 13, 2000.
