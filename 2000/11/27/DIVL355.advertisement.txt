What is Anxiety?
Anxiety is an emotion of elusive
uneasiness and sometimes dreaded
tension. The intensity (if feeling may
range from extremely mild to
moderate to very severe, and the
level of discomfort can change. It
may be short-lived, chronic, epi
stxlic, or some combination of these.
Anxiety has an impact on both our
physical and mental systems. It
affects how we feel, think and
perceive; it precipitates muscle
tension and activity in adrenal
system, and it influences our
motivation and our behavior.
Causes
Anxiety is caused by many
different things. I hese may
include:
■ Large amounts of academic
work, limited time, and human
limitations
■ Challenging relationships with
professors
■ Separation from home or
country
■ Problems in relationships
■ Illness or death of family
members
■ Anxiety disorders such as
social anxiety and panic attacks
■ Excessive worrying
■ Medical problems (e.g., hyper
or hypothyroid disorders,
tumors of the adrenal gland,
and diabetes)
■ Monthly hormonal changes
Ever feel like you're barely going
to inuke it? Life today is even
more complicated than it was for

Effects
Anxiety can be either helpful or
harmful. When mild, anxiety can
motivate students to engage in the
academic tasks or social situations
that triggered it. When moderate or
severe and chmnic, it may lead to:
■ Generalized stress
■ Performing below one's capa
bilities
■ Avoiding participation in
classroom discussions
■ Perfectionism and over-prepar
ation
■ Procrastination
■ C hoking" or confusion during
exams
■ Over-fearfulness of failing a
class
■ Excessive fear of asking fora
date
■ Fear of being evaluated or
judged
■ Panic reactions
■ A less-than-full university
experience
What to Do
Many students feel "stressed"
when facing exams or experiences
that pose some risk or threat. For
some, this situational anxiety
abates once the challenge is over;
for others, the burden of anxiety
continues. Here are some tips for
coping with anxiety:
■ Avoid letting your worries
build up; talk with someone
about them
■ Learn relaxation techniques (e.g.,
deep breathing or muscle
relaxation, calming music, or
inspirational reading)
■ Set aside a regular time to
practice relaxation, and give it
high priority
■ Iry not to fixate on the anxiety -
you may stimulate it even more
■ Rather than pushing to have
the anxiety go away instantly
(which can make it get worse),
let it subside gradually
■ Observe yourself: do you get
anxious about being anxious
■ Rather than resisting your
anxiety, try developing a
"friendship" with it
■ In exams or under deadlines,
don't keep looking at your
watch or the clock
■ When anxiety medication has
been prescribed by a psychi
atrist or a physician who
knows you, take it
■ join one of the anxiety groups
offered at CAPS
■ Educate yourself about the
form of anxiety you have
(you'll find material on anxiety
in the CAPS waiting room) and
at theCowell Health Library
Fora professional evaluation of the
anxiety you experience, call CAPS at
723-3785. There's no need to stmggle
alone. []
