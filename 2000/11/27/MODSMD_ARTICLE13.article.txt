()n Nov. 27, 1935, an article ran in The
Daily reporting about the cowardice of a
certain Kast Coast school.
"Graduate Manager Alfred R. Masters
late last night vociferously denied inviting
1 larvard to oppose Stanford in the 1936
Rose Bowl.
"The denial was in response to a wire
sent to The Daily lroni Cambridge to the ef
fect that William J. Bingham of Harvard
had telegraphed refusal of an alleged bid to
Masters.
"The wire received by The Daily, signed
by 1 lenry (Hark, editor of the 1 larvard
(Irimson, follows:
"Hie following wire is being sent today
slop Mr. Alfred R. Masters Stanford Athletic
Association Palo Alto Calif stop Harvard re
grets it cannot accept your Bowl invitation

- Princeton) agreement we are unable to en
gage in any post season games it will also be
impossible next year becuase our present
policy extends until 1938 good luck on New
Year's Day William }. Bingham.' "
Bottom line: Surprising? Not at all. However,
what is even less surprising is that the wire turned
out to be a hoax played by the ever-so-witty Har
vard Lampoon.
