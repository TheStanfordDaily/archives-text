ADKN, Yemen (AP) —
Yemeni investigators are ready
to charge at least two people in
the apparent terrorist attack on
the I SS (lole, a source said yes
terday, six weeks alter an explo
sion tore through the warship as
it sat in Aden's harbor.
Charges are expected to be
liled as soon as this week against
the two suspects, the source
said, rhey could be sentenced
to death if convicted.
But any charges are unlikely
to mean the end of the probe:
U.S. investigators suspect an in
ternational conspiracy was be
hind the bombing.
Seventeen U.S. sailors were
killed and 39 more injured on
Oct. 12, when two suicide
bombers steered a small boat
laden with explosives alongside
the Cole and detonated it while
the destroyer was refueling.
U.S. and Yemeni officials have
said i lie attack appeared to be a
carefully planned, well-fi
nanced operation, and the
bomb materials were expertly
prepared.
1 he Yemeni source close to
the investigation would not
identify the two men he de
scribed as main suspects about
to be charged. But last week,
other sources said authorities
had detained six Yemeni men
they believe were key accom
plices — including one who was
allegedly in charge of the oper
ation in Yemen.
American ollicials have said
tliev believe the operation was
carried out by a network of
small cells of two or three peo
ple, probably from one or
more anti-American Islamist
organizations, including
Yemen's Islamic Jihad, Egypt's
al-Camaa al-lslamiva and

Saudi dissident Osama bin
Laden's followers.
Bin Laden, an exiled Saudi
millionaire, lives in Afghanistan.
U.S. officials believe he ordered
the 1998 bombings of the U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanza
nia that killed 224 people.
Officials have suggested that
the Cole attackers were from
various Arab countries, includ
ing Yemen, Egypt, and Saudi
Arabia, and that they may be
operating from both
Afghanistan and Yemen.
A Yemeni security official,
also speaking on condition of
anonymity yesterday, said in
vestigations revealed that an
Egyptian suspect whom he
identified only as tiamdi fled
Yemen a month before the
bombing along with five others,
including a Libyan man. He
said all six men had links to Is
lamic Jihad, but he did not elab
orate further.
The first Yemeni source
said the charges planned
against at least two suspects in
cluded carrying out the attack,
threatening state security,
forming an armed gang and
possessing explosives.
Conviction on all four
charges would carry a mini
mum sentence of 10 years in
prison, the source said, adding
that the suspects could be exe
cuted if convicted of threaten
ing state security or carrying out
the bombings. Most executions
in Yemen are by firing squad
and are performed in public to
set an example.
The prosecution will review
the case In tomorrow before lil
ing charges, the source said on
condition of anonymity. Ihe
prosecutor declined to com
ment vesterdav.
