NEYV Y( )RK (AP) — I he first weekend of
llie holiday shoppingseason turned out lobe
,i pleasant surprise for worried retailers: The
consumers who crowded malls and used e
commcrce sites spent more than expected.
"Sales looked pretty decent," Mi< hael P.
Niemira, vice president of the Bank of
fokyo Mitsubishi, said yesteray as he esti
mated that the weekend's sales would be
about 5 to (') percent higher than last year.
"It's a good start to the season. But where it
goes from here remains to be seen."
I be solid sales followed months of slug
gish business for many retailers, but the
I hanksgiving weekend receipts were the
result of hard work by merchants.
Fated with an overall drop in consumer
spending, retailers began discounting earli
er than usual and focused more on what
they expected would be the hot items.
Sears, Roebuck and do., lor example, is

holding its "Best Prices of the Season" cam
paign in early December, instead of after
the holidays.
A combination of stock market volatility,
high interest rates, and rising fuel prices
have made consumers c ut back on things
they don't really need. Analysts say the un
resolved presidential election also has con
tributed to shoppers' uncertainty.
Retailers are nervous about consumers
like David Penner, a 58-year-old teacher
from Andover. Mass., who plans to cut his
holiday budget because he is spending
$1 ()(),()()() in home renovations. They also
want Eleanor |aick, 55, of Florham Park.
N.J., who was just browsing Saturday at
New Jersey's Short Hills Mall, to get excited
about this year's chunky sweaters and
leather coats.
However, Jaick lamented: "There's
nothing out there to buy in fashion."
