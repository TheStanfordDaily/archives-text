## The
						Stanford Daily No more delay: Approve land-use plan 
### 
Published Since IHVI

Todays vote on the General
Use Permit and Community
Plan signals the end of 1(>
months of discussion. With
joe Simitians unreasonable 99-vear
Foothills preservation plan out of the
vvav, the Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors will hopefully approve a
plan that is acceptable to both the L 11i
versity and the community. We eagerly
await such a positive outcome to the
long process or negotiation between the
County and the University.
Both the board and the University
have shown flexibility in negotiations.
Stanford agreed to extend its moratori
um on academic building in the
Foothills from 10 to 25 years. The board

chose to devote an extra four weeks to
tlie consideration of"Stanford's proposal
and a more thorough review of commu
nity input. We commend both parties
for their willingness to respond to the
concerns of the community.
Now the supervisors need to recognize
that Stanford has achieved a reasonable
compromise. It is encouraging to hear
thai Supervisor Donald Cage discarded
Simitians plan. Gage was reacting to
threats of lawsuits from Stanford's
lawyers, but the move to abandon the
measure showed good judgment
nonetheless. The 25-year compromise is a
desirable alternative to Simitian s plan.
I ncler this agreement, rather than
precluding the next century's possibili

lies, this generation can value its priori
lies and still allow its successors to choose
their own. The 25-year plan puts envi
ronmental protection at a premium with
out the arrogance of a 99-year decree.
I he approval of the General Use Per
mit and Community Plan is necessary to
allow the I niversitv to build desperately
needed housing. The surrounding com
munities will enjoy an ease in the hous
ing crunch after Stanford completes its
proposed housing projects. Palo Alto
residents will also benefit from the
speedy establishment of the new Palo
Alto Middle School, which will take the
place of the Jewish Community Center
after the center is relocated to Stanford
owned land.

Without the plan's acceptance, these
and other projects will be painstakingly
slow, as each measure will need to gain
approval from the (lounty. 1 he passage
of the plan won't mean the end of I ni
versitv-communitv negotiations. Indi
vidual projects will still come under re
view before enactment, but the outline
provided by the agreement will facili
tate the swift conclusion of these
decisions.
We believe that approval of an accept
able land-use plan this morning will
benefit both the University and the com
munity. We encourage the county to
vote for Stanford's General Use Permit
on terms that the University is willing to
accept.
