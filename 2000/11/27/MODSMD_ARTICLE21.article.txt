# TURNING AND TURNING
## Blueprint for activism 
### 
The bu/./word <>! I lie* year, at least
on college campuses, max verx
well be "activism." Look any
where — Ihe 1 )ailx, the nation
al press, the person sitting next to xou in
the dining hall — and you'll line I some
s<>i tof <list ussion related to the resurgent e
in youthful activism in the late 4( .)05.
Some — usually people who were in col
lege in the 1960s — shrug oil todax's
protests oil as just another pari ol the
MTV-fueled teenage culture. As one for
mer Vietnam War protester remarked.

" I bis isn't a protest.
I his is a concert at the
public's expense."
I'he lact ol'ihe mallei
is activism is back. Fxen
worse, its "in." Foday,
the onlx people labeled
as "activists" are the
dreadlocked legion of
vegans that descent led

upon Seattle last year.
Activism is no longer an activity hut a
lifestyle choice. As if this in and ol it sell isn't
had enough, 11 has become counterpro
ductive to social change. IK setting up a
distinction between "activists" and "mere
liberals who mean well," toda\ 's activism is
dangeroush dose to betraying the move
ments it seeks to further.
First of all, let's get rid ol that distinction,
lo dillerentiate IxMween "activist" dread
locked vegans and well-meaning, dean-cut
"poseurs" is divisive and doesn't help ac
complish anv goals. "At tivism" shouldn't be
identified with any sort ol si\le, personality
typeor dietan habit. I lie more we equate n
with a lilest\ le, the less it becomes a method
lor stxial and political change — and the
further it gets from itst>wn mission.
Agent s lor change, of all people, should
recognize the dignity of their fellow ac
tivists' work as well as they do the dignitvol
the workers they protest for. Wearing the
wrong clothes, having the wrong hairstyle
and ingesting the wrong foods should onl\
become .in issue in campaigns against fash
ion, hairstyles and dietary habits. In all
other cases, they are irrelevant and should
be treated as such.
Of course, the syncretism of so many
self-styled activists precludes this simple
piece of advice from ever being taken seri
ously. Rather than being fen used on a sin
gle issue, protests are based around some
dread locked ideologue's vision of what the
world, and people, ought to Ik* like. I his is
why medicinal marijuana, "Free Mumia!"
and anti-globalization .ill wind up being
part of the same protest.
This gathering of multiple c auses under

one tent is countcrprodut ii\e; n states oil
the people who might support <i single
cause hut don't necessarilx hux into am ol
the others, lot example, alienating
(lat holi< ani i-capil al-punish men I
protesters who don't necessarilx want lo le
galize marijuana weakens the hase ol
protesters. It's sabotaging a single cause he
cause the gux with the dreads wants .ill oi
nothing.
I lave (le.ir goals and a< hiexe them. I o
set up some sort ol vision <>l an activist rev
olution that will sweep the countrx is to in
troduce confusion into anx single protest.
I hink not in lei ins ol an ongoing revolu
tion but in terms ol immediate goals — lot
example, lair wages lor workers, both for
eign and domestic. (onlinue to light when
the music's over, but remember to go
home when the light has been won.
Budding ('.lie ('•uevaras should take
note. Full-st ale revolution doesn't appeal to
most Americans. Siucessliil Anient an leftist
moxenients haxe alwaxs made appeals to
the line spirit ol Amei i< a, not the true spir
it of Karl Marx or Frent li radicalism.
Along these same lines, make public
demonstrations accessible and useful.
I nx iting Rage Against the Mat bine scares
people with delicate hearing axvax. I'liblit
at ts t>f 1 )adaism onlx confuse people and
give lliein bad ideas about "todax's
youth."
Forget academic adixism — quoting
Derrida and Foucatilt ai the top of xour
lungs max get you an A on yout perfor
mance art project bin won't xvin atvxbotlx

atic>ii lot ilie Situationist International.
Aim to gather people together to make a
dillerent e, not to ease xour own academic
or middle-class guilt xvith cathartic displavs
thai vou t .ill "activist."
Next, be articulate. "Man." "dude" and
"like" do not convex ideaselleclivelv. I )on't
base your speech on profanities. I he Right
has alreadx come up with a political vocab
ulary that furthers its agenda. Note that
phrases like "welfare queen" became part
t>l the country's everyday speech shortK
belbret longress voted loget i id of 'welfare.
Flie activist Felt has solar managed to
come up with little that the public can
imagine it sell saving. There is a middle
ground between Rage Against the Ma
chine lyrics and Marxist political theorx.
Find it and use it to win people over.
He lore activism lights The Man. it's
going to have to lake on a Man ol its own.
And that Man is the gux with the dreads.
