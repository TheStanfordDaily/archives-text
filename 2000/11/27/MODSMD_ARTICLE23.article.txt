Daily advising editorial off-target
I l.ul \ou done some research or maybe
jnsi thought about the article fora little bit,
\oiir I uesdav editorial ("Freshman Advis
ing System Needs Boost," Nov. 21) would
have been extremely diflerent.
1) When asked, the one thing most Stan
lord students remember about the fresh
man advising system is not the quarterly
quest lor the approval code. Yes, it does
happen thai some liosh have difficulty get
ting thcit approval codes. I lowever, il you
look. I think \ou will find that the number
ol Irosh that encounter this difficulty is lar
smaller than you think.
Most, il you were to actually ask. would
remember other things, like an advising
dinner, or an Advising Associate stopping
l>\. or their I lead Advising Associate help
ing them with something. Freshman Advi
sors sign up because it is something they
7rani to do. Don't trivialize their contribu
tion simply because you have heard a few
stories about frosh having a hard time get
ting approval codes.
2) Some Freslunan Advisors do not gel
the job done, but, in general, most of them
arc vcrv well intentioned. Your editorial is

right; good intentions onlx go so far and
sometimes there is a knowledge gap.
However, that is one ol the reasons xvlix
they have a student working with them
(the AA). I hex are not supposed It) be in
finite fountains ol knowledge for fresh
men but rather resources who can either
gather information lor the freshmen or
point the freshmen t<> the people who
have the information. Part of the fresh
man experience is both learning about
Stanford as well as learning to lend for
oneself at Stanford. The FAs are guides to
help Irtish along with this.
?>) Your editorial ox eric >t Â»ks I he* cllorls of
some ol the bat tiest working individuals in
the entire advising system, the Head Ad
vising Associates. HAAs live in the dorms
and are there to provide a relatively ton
slant source of advising and in most wax s
fill the role ol the I JA( '.-trained profession
als mentioned in the editorial.
It is utterly insulting to their cllorls that
you completely forgot to include them.
They work extremely hard both visibly,
when advising students and putting on
programs, and also invisibly, when coordi
nating their AA teams and ac ting as infor
mational resources for dorm advisors and

students.
I lie advising program at Stanford is fur
more than just Freshman Advisors, and
the I IAAs are an extremely important part
of this system. I he\ are an extremely ded
icated group of students and they deserve
far more credit than they get.
