### NICHOLAS CHAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For some students, graduating in lour years
is a struggle, lint lot a select lew seniors, gradu
ation won't l>e a problem. I hey have finished all
of theii major requirements in three years and
are left with a year to use as they please.
Completing the requirements necessary to
graduate usuall) lakes a lull four years because
students aren't sine ol their majors or change
majors, making H necessary for them to start 1u 1 -
filling different requirements alter a year or two
in a previous major. Nut this wasn't the case for
senior Jenny Dorth.
"It just kind of happened that way," Dorth
said. "I fuman biology, if you count the pre-med
requirements, iseas\ to finish in three years."
Dorth has one more class lo take before she
finishes her major in human biology.
A small number of students enter Stanford
already knowing their desired course of study.
I because they can start taking courses and plan
ning their academic strategy as soon as they
enter college, these students have a better
chain e ol 112 inishing I heir majors early.
"I knew m\ major asa freshman," said senior
Kri< Silverberg. Silverberg, the head advising
associate for Brainier I fall, is majoring in com
puter science, one of ihe largest majors the I ni
versitv lias to offer.

Planning has been <111 integral part ol Silver
berg's academic career.
"1 started planning how 1 would complete
my major halfway through my sophomore
year," he said.
Because Silverberg thought ahead, he onl\
had to take an average ol If> units a quarter.
"I'd say academically, it was challenging
every quarter, but 1 was able to balance my
schedule and the type of classes that I took so it
was never overwhelming," he said.
Although Silverberg has known his major
since he entered Stanford, he explored his other
existing interest sand learned of new interests b\
completing general education requirements.
"I discovered I had a deep interest in reli
gious studies," he said. "During spring quarter,
I decided lo tome back lor a fourth year and
pursue a minor in religious studies," he ex
plained. "Beyond that. I wauled to have a lot
more free lime and really enjoy myself and my
time in college."
In accordance with this goal, Silverberg ap
plied and was accepted to be the head advising
associate in Brainier. He said he wouldn't have
taken this job unless he was finished wilh his
major.
"li s so much fun," he observed. "It's one ol
ihe best choices I think I've made at Stanford. I
decided that for my last year, I realh wanted to
enjoy myself and get lo know more people and

participate in the s<m ial activities ili.it Sianlbrd
had that I didn't have time lor in tlu- past. By
being stall and living in a freshman dorm, n
gives me an opportunitx to panic ipate in these
activities that I didn't have belore.
1 here are many other options students have
to nse their spare lime alter finishing their
major. I)orth will complete a minor in cm iron
mental engineering during her senior year.
"I happened lo be looking through the lime
schedule and rill the c lasses I wanted to take lell
into lhai |area|," she said.
Dorth has several other academic «i< tin iii<->
that will occupy her time senior year. After
doing research over the summei, she decided to
do an honors lliesis this vear.
Although both students seem lo be enjo\ing
the prospect ola senior vear without s( 1 ambling
to finish major requirements, neithei Silverl >ci g
nor I)orth would recommend Irving to finish .1
major in three years.
"1 would have liked lo have spac ed 11 out and
interspersed[wiih| my minoi," I )orih admitted.
"I should have thought more long term.
Silverberg agreed.
"I'd say lhat there's 110 inherent benefit in fin
ishing your major early bet ause the jobs will «il
ways be there, but the opportunities thai vou
have in college in a dorm selling are once in a
lifetime," he advised, " fake advantage <>l them
as much as possible."
