### ALEX BENJAMIN STAFF WRITER 
I wo down, three to go.
On Saturday, night, the Stan
lord men's soccet team advanced
into the quarterfinals ol the N(IAA
lournament, ufring a six-goal sec
ond hall to eliminate Illinois-
Chicago 0-0. The Cardinal is now
three wins aua\ from taking the
national chafnpionship trophy
home, and with a win this Saturday
against Southern Methodist it will
advance to tlte national semifinals
in (.harloite.;
With au impressive IN-2-1
record, No.fr seed Stanford seems
to be peaking at just the tight
time. In its/lirsl two matches ol the
tournament the (Cardinal scored a
total of 10 unanswered goals —
the biggest margin ol vic tory ol
the remaining eight teams. Satur
day's vin over the Flames also
gives the team its 10th shutout ol
the season, setting a new school
record.
(Coining into tlu- game the (car
dinal was favored over the Haines,
who were the champions ol the
Midwestern Collegiate ( '.onlerence
— a league with fewer talented

teams than the the rugged Pacific
10 ('.onlerence. But Stanford head
coach Bobby ('.lark, for one, wasn't
taking anything for granted.
"This was a game that I was
afraid that we could lose," Clark
said. "After last week's win, this was
the type of game that we could
have overlooked."
Saturday's game would prove
otherwise as the Cardinal im
proved on last week's dominating
1-0 win over a more competitive
Cal State-Fullerton team. But, un
like last week, where Stanford
ended the game early by scoring
lour times in the lirst twenty min
utes, the team would have to wait
until the second hall befbre putting
the game away.
I hat lirst half went by with Stan
lord in complete control, with the
Cardinal winning most of the dis
puted balls put into the middle of
the- field and putting significant
pressure on the UIC defense.
Flames goalkeeper Chris Jamal
was only forced to make two saves
despite eight shots on goal, thanks
to inaccurate shots by Stanford at
tackers. With lew counterattacks by
the outmatched UIC offense, the
lirst hall ended in a 0-0 tie.
It was only two minutes into
the second half when senior for

home crowd that the rest of the

just as his teammates did all night against Stanford in the Cardinal's 6-0
thumping of the Flames in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.
game would be the opposite of
the lirst hall. Working oil a de
flected pass outside the UIC
penalty box, Woolfolk found
himself all alone with Jamal and
calmly put the hall into the hack
ol the net for his fourth goal of
the tournament.
Little did the Flames know that
the worst was vet to come.
L\actl\ five minutes later, .it
r>2:LT>, Stanford senior midfielder
Matt Moses headed a pass from ju
nior midfielder Derek Shanahan
hack into the box, where senior de
lender Lee Morrison came out of
the back to score his third goal of
the season.
In the f>()th minute Wool folk
proved he wasn't clone, as sopho
more forward Roger Levesc|iieand
senior midfielder Ryan Nelsen
teamed up to get the ball to the se
nior forward on the breakaway.
Woolfolk took the ball into the box
.ind sent a shot pass jamal, notch

ing lus twelfth goal ofihe season.
Only one minute later, Woolfolk
found Levesque open in the box
lor the sophomore's seventh goal
of the year.
In two games W'oolfblk has now
scored ."> goals (two of I hem game
winners) to lead the Cardinal
through its lirst two rounds ol the
tournament. 1 le scored onl\ seven
during the regular season.
"1 am a senior, he said. "This is
my last chance."
According to (Hark, however,
W'oollolk's recent success is no sur
prise.
"Unlbrinnately, many people
measure success In the number ol
goals someone scores, ( '.lark s.iid.
"C.ore\ lias been setting people up
all year and does so much out on
the field. \ow he is finalh getting
rewarded."
Kven with the Cardinal in com
plete control of the game, leading
4-0, the oflensiveonslaught was lar
from over. With 10 minutes re
maining in the game, both junior
forward Mike Murph\ and Nelsen
got in on the ac lion.
\i «S(>:S() Shanahan brought the

ball down the left side of the field
and made a beautiful cross to Mur
phy, who volleyed the pass past the
goalkeeper lor his third goal on the
season.
1 )own 5-0,1 l(:brought in back
up goalkeeper Scott Creene to re
place Jamal, hoping to get the
freshman some postseason experi
ence. Ryan Nelsen made sure
(ireene wouldn't leave without
being victimized, finishing Stan
lord's scoring in the 82nd minute
with a rebound shot after two (lar
dinal shots hit the post.
"A lot of teams have disc ipline,
but it is the good teams that hold
their disc ipline," (Hark said. "The
team did a good job not panic king,
and keeping their locus. ( herall it
was ,» good performance and a
good victory."
Willi the win over the weekend,
the (lardinal will lace off against a
lough sixth seed in Southern
Methodist on Saturday. Consider
ing the (lardinal's higher seed, the
game will likel\ be plaved at New
Malonex Field, but the official site
will be determined later toda\ bv
