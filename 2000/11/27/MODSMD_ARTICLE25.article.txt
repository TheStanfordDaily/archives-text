I wo down, three to go.
On Saturday, night, the Stan
lord men's soccet team advanced
into the quarterfinals ol the N(IAA
lournament, ufring a six-goal sec
ond hall to eliminate Illinois-
Chicago 0-0. The Cardinal is now
three wins aua\ from taking the
national chafnpionship trophy
home, and with a win this Saturday
against Southern Methodist it will
advance to tlte national semifinals
in (.harloite.;
With au impressive IN-2-1
record, No.fr seed Stanford seems
to be peaking at just the tight
time. In its/lirsl two matches ol the
tournament the (Cardinal scored a
total of 10 unanswered goals —
the biggest margin ol vic tory ol
the remaining eight teams. Satur

utes, the team would have to wait
until the second hall befbre putting
the game away.

lord in complete control, with the
Cardinal winning most of the dis

the- field and putting significant
pressure on the UIC defense.
Flames goalkeeper Chris Jamal
was only forced to make two saves
despite eight shots on goal, thanks
to inaccurate shots by Stanford at
tackers. With lew counterattacks by
the outmatched UIC offense, the
lirst hall ended in a 0-0 tie.
