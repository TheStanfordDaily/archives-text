answered with seven straight points to give

search for the flow," Jacobsen said. "I think

we found it tonight. We slat ted gettingeas\
looks and once we're ahead our defense will
sustain whatever lead we have. We have
confident e in that.
Despite minor injuries to the team's big
men, the (lardinal defense held (.eorgia to
