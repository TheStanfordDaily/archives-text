# Board votes on land plan tonight
## 
### GREG BRAZEAL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Santa C '.lara County's Board of Supervisors is
scheduled to hold a vote today that will determine
the limits of Stanford's future growth. The Uni
versitv has asked for permission to build 2,035.000
square feet ol academic facilities over the next
decade, development that could include expand
ed laboratories, a new basketball pavilion, Bio-X
facilities and even a new student union.
Stanford also planned to build enough oil-cam
pus residences to house 3,01 S fatuity, studcntsand
staff, including a promised 1,900 spaces for single
graduate students.
1 hroughout the debate over Stanford's plans,
few have questioned the need for housing and no
serious plan has ever been put forward to grant
Stanford less academic development space than ii
requests. Regardless of how the supervisors vote

today, it seems almost certain that 10 years from
now, the housing crisis that has plagued graduate
students for the last several years will be at least
partially relieved.
The supervisors' vote was originally scheduled
for Oct. 31 and may be delayed again. But if the

supervisors deliver a final dec i
sion today. «iikl if Stanford ac
cepts the decision, a controvcrsx
that lias spanned lf> months, two
Stanford presidents, do/ens of
hearings, thousands ol e-mails to
(ount\ oHic i,its. hundreds ol let -
teis to the editor and several
inches of .1 graduate student's
beard (Paul I lartkc, the ( hair ol
the Graduate Student Gouncil,
claims not to have shaved since
the hearings began) will finally
draw to .1 dose.
I he largest issue still on the
table is preservation <>l Stanford's
2,200-ac re Foothills. Stanford
original!v argued that the 10 years
of open-space protection con
tained in its Max 1999 permit ap
plication should be enough.
1 >ut from the beginning, envi
ronmental groups such as the
St an lord ()pen Space Alliance and
the Goinmittee for Green
Foothills demanded permanent
protection 101 the entire Foothills.
I'hev also argued that <1 semi
developed area southwest of Ju
nipero Sena Boulevard (ailed
the Lathrop District should be
left at its current stage of devel
opment. I he area contains parts
ol the golf course and a few small
buildings.
As the debate intensified last
vcar, the citv councils ol Palo Alto,
Menlo Park and Portola Vallev;
the Sierra Ghib and the San |ose
Mercury News joined the Stan
lord Open Space Alliance in de
manding that the Foothills be per
manently set aside from develop
ment. A petition began (initiating
that now, according to the al
liance, contains over I."). 000 signa
tures m support ol permanent
open-space protection.
I'nder pressure from the
growing preservationist alliance,
the Gounty's Planning Gommis
sion included ,1 2.">-vear Foothill
development ban in its recom
mendations to the Board ol Su
pervisors
Stanford reluctantly accepted

I he Manning Commission's pro
posal bill emphasized lhal am
Foothill development ban longer
than 25 years would be unaccept
able and might lead to legal action.
It seemed like the land-use de
bate might end up in court when,
a week before the Board ol Super
visors was originally scheduled to
vole on Stanford's plans, Supervi
soi |oe Similian unveiled a pro
posal that Stanford should be re
quired to set aside roughly 1,000
acres ol the foothills for the next
ccnturv in exchange lor permis
sion to develop its ret]nested 17
acres of academic facilities.
Similian said later that he had
already discussed his plans in pri
vate with Stan lord representa
tives, but the University con
demned Simitian's plan as "last
minute" and "unacceptable."
At the final public hearings
over Stanford's development
plans, support for the I niversit)
swelled. Communii\ members
who found Simitian's demands
unfair to the University began
forming their own groups, sin h as
Citizens for Stanford and the
(lommunity.
As of last week, Simitian's oflice
reported that H was receiving
roughly equal numbers of e-mail
lor and against Simitian's open
space preservation proposal.
I he Palo Alto Daily News and
the San Francisco Chronicle
called Simitian's ( J ( .)-vcar ban rea
sonable, but public opinion
seemed to have shifted toward the
University.
Finally, early last week, the San
|osc Mercury News reported that
Donald (iage, chair ol the Board
of Supervisors, had declared
Simitian's proposal "dead."
I he Supervisors had met with
Stanford officials and were appar
ently convinced that a 99-year
ban. even if it was mostly limited to
hillside areas in the Foothills un
suiled lor development, would
leave the County vulnerable to
lawsuits.
I he alliance and the Commit
tee for Green Foothills had ob
tained legal opinions suggesting
that permanent open-space pro
tection would be within the (oun

t\ s power, but Stanfc>rd's legal ar
guments were apparenth more
convincing.
Barring a last-minute reversal
In the supervisors, it appears that
the battle over the preservation of
Stanford's open spaces will be de
ferred for at least 25 years. It re
mains to be seen whether or how
much the Board's final decision
will differ from the recommenda
tions oflered by iheCountv s Plan
ning (commission and al reach ac
cepted by Stanford.
The last lime Stanford went
through land-use negotiations
with the County was a little over
10 years ago. Stanford's 1 989 per
mit paved the way for the more
expansion than am other decade
the University's history, including
the founding years.
The permit under considera
tion today asks lor even more
growth, mostly because of the
larger request lor housing.
As Similian has pointed out, if
the Board approves Stanford's re
quests, then by 2010 "the Univer
sity will for the second time have
doubled in si/e in 25 years."
I le adds, "Rather obviously, this
level of exponential growth . . .can
not continue in perpetuity, or even .
.. lor the next 25 or 50 years."
Stanford and the County will
have to determine in the coining
years the absolute level of growth
that Stanford's lands can success
fully accommodate.
I lie supervisors may even de
cide today, as Similian has sug
gested, that Stanford be required
to commission a "Buildout Study"
in exchange lor permission to
build what it has requested over
the next 10 years.
The University is blessed with
an enormous acreage, unmatched
by any of its competitors in the
Fast, but at some point will have to
draw the line and work with the
spaces it has already developed.
Because of the generosity and
foresight of Leland Stanford, that
time may be a long way off. Until
then, environmentalists will just
have to hope lhal Stanford contin
ues to steward its lands with the
responsibility and tare it has
shown up to now.

Stanford reluctantly accepted

I he Manning Commission's pro
posal bill emphasized lhal am
Foothill development ban longer

a week before the Board ol Super

demned Simitian's plan as "last
minute" and "unacceptable."
At the final public hearings
over Stanford's development

swelled. Communii\ members
who found Simitian's demands
unfair to the University began
forming their own groups, sin h as
Citizens for Stanford and the
(lommunity.
As of last week, Simitian's oflice
reported that H was receiving
roughly equal numbers of e-mail
lor and against Simitian's open
space preservation proposal.
I he Palo Alto Daily News and
the San Francisco Chronicle
called Simitian's ( J ( .)-vcar ban rea
sonable, but public opinion
seemed to have shifted toward the
University.
Finally, early last week, the San
|osc Mercury News reported that
Donald (iage, chair ol the Board
of Supervisors, had declared
Simitian's proposal "dead."
I he Supervisors had met with
Stanford officials and were appar
ently convinced that a 99-year
ban. even if it was mostly limited to
hillside areas in the Foothills un
suiled lor development, would
leave the County vulnerable to
lawsuits.
I he alliance and the Commit
tee for Green Foothills had ob
tained legal opinions suggesting
that permanent open-space pro

convincing.
Barring a last-minute reversal
In the supervisors, it appears that
the battle over the preservation of
Stanford's open spaces will be de
ferred for at least 25 years. It re
mains to be seen whether or how
much the Board's final decision
will differ from the recommenda
tions oflered by iheCountv s Plan
ning (commission and al reach ac
cepted by Stanford.
The last lime Stanford went
through land-use negotiations
with the County was a little over
10 years ago. Stanford's 1 989 per
mit paved the way for the more
expansion than am other decade
the University's history, including
the founding years.
The permit under considera
tion today asks lor even more
growth, mostly because of the
larger request lor housing.
As Similian has pointed out, if
the Board approves Stanford's re
quests, then by 2010 "the Univer
sity will for the second time have
doubled in si/e in 25 years."
I le adds, "Rather obviously, this
level of exponential growth . . .can
not continue in perpetuity, or even .
.. lor the next 25 or 50 years."
Stanford and the County will
have to determine in the coining
years the absolute level of growth
that Stanford's lands can success
fully accommodate.
I lie supervisors may even de
cide today, as Similian has sug
gested, that Stanford be required
to commission a "Buildout Study"
in exchange lor permission to
build what it has requested over
the next 10 years.
The University is blessed with
an enormous acreage, unmatched
by any of its competitors in the
Fast, but at some point will have to
draw the line and work with the
spaces it has already developed.
Because of the generosity and
foresight of Leland Stanford, that
time may be a long way off. Until
then, environmentalists will just
have to hope lhal Stanford contin
ues to steward its lands with the
responsibility and tare it has
shown up to now.
Santa C '.lara County's Board of Supervisors is
scheduled to hold a vote today that will determine
the limits of Stanford's future growth. The Uni
versitv has asked for permission to build 2,035.000
square feet ol academic facilities over the next
decade, development that could include expand
ed laboratories, a new basketball pavilion, Bio-X
facilities and even a new student union.
Stanford also planned to build enough oil-cam
pus residences to house 3,01 S fatuity, studcntsand
staff, including a promised 1,900 spaces for single
graduate students.
1 hroughout the debate over Stanford's plans,
few have questioned the need for housing and no
serious plan has ever been put forward to grant
Stanford less academic development space than ii
requests. Regardless of how the supervisors vote

today, it seems almost certain that 10 years from
now, the housing crisis that has plagued graduate
students for the last several years will be at least
partially relieved.
The supervisors' vote was originally scheduled
for Oct. 31 and may be delayed again. But if the

supervisors deliver a final dec i
sion today. «iikl if Stanford ac
cepts the decision, a controvcrsx
that lias spanned lf> months, two
Stanford presidents, do/ens of
hearings, thousands ol e-mails to
(ount\ oHic i,its. hundreds ol let -
teis to the editor and several
inches of .1 graduate student's
beard (Paul I lartkc, the ( hair ol
the Graduate Student Gouncil,
claims not to have shaved since
the hearings began) will finally
draw to .1 dose.
I he largest issue still on the
table is preservation <>l Stanford's
2,200-ac re Foothills. Stanford
original!v argued that the 10 years
of open-space protection con
tained in its Max 1999 permit ap
plication should be enough.
1 >ut from the beginning, envi
ronmental groups such as the
St an lord ()pen Space Alliance and
the Goinmittee for Green
Foothills demanded permanent
protection 101 the entire Foothills.
I'hev also argued that <1 semi
developed area southwest of Ju
nipero Sena Boulevard (ailed
the Lathrop District should be
left at its current stage of devel
opment. I he area contains parts
ol the golf course and a few small
buildings.
