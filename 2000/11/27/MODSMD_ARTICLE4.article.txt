Is the teriyaki chicken or the vegetable
stir-fry better? Might as well take a
healthy serving of each uid leave the de
cision, along with the uneaten leftovers,
lot later.
The small decisions that students make
like this one add up to lots of wasted food.
In Florence Moore Hall alone, that
means more than 1,000 pounds of food
go to waste each week.
Last year, students involved in the
Stanford Project on Nutrition, more com
monly known by the acronym SPOON,
spent time weighing the half-eaten ham
burgers, untouched salads and other
foods that go to waste on the dirty-tray
racks of dining halls to come up with fig
ures like this one. This effort was part of a
larger and continuing effort by SPOON
to address food waste on campus.
According to SP()()N's Web site, Stan

lord, as an institution, is the Peninsula's
single largest consumer of food. SP()()N
members would like to see that it is not
also the Peninsula's largest squanderer of
food.
SP()()N's activities to meet this goal in
volve transferring food not served in the
dining halls and eating clubs on campus
to local food banks. (looks in participating
kitchens package cxt ess food in bags pro
vided by SP()()N. Each week, a volunteer
tomes by to pit k up the food and transfer
it to a central freezer. From there, it is dis
tributed to soup kitchens in Palo Alto.
SPOON works closely with two local
organizations, Urban Ministry and The
Bread of Life, to ensure thai this loot! gets
to those who are hungry.
SPOON is not on its own in the cru
sade. Dining hall managers are receptive
toSP()()N"scHorts and share their g<>al of
minimizing waste, project members said.
I 'heir donations provide several hundred
meals a week.

Bernice Woo, manager of the Florence
Moore Dining Facility, which does not
participate in the SPOON program,
claims that there is little waste from the
production side in Florence Moore
Dining.
"Accurate statistics of the number of
students at each meal are kept," she said,
"to gauge how much food should be pre
pared."
She went on to explain that whereas
dining services used to cook large
amounts of food ahead of time, they have
evolved toward a "just-in-time" approach
which minitni/es waste by preparing food
as it is needed.
Then is there a legitimate waste prob
lem? Yes, SPOON members said, al
though it stems from a source that is out
of their direct control: students.
"Much of the food waste in campus
dining halls is generated bv students who
get more food that lhe\ eat or
don i s| n*( 11 \ lit.u would like a
smaller portion than is regularly
served." explained sophomore
Sabrina llernandes, SPOON s
east campus
< oordinator.
Because so mut li ol the waste is
due to student habits, SP()()N re< -
ognizes the limits to what the\ can
do by simply transferring loocl that
is not served l>\ the dining halls.
"The most important clifler
ence we can make is to raise aware
ness among students, to help I lieni
realize that there is a hunger prob
lem in the surrounding communi
ties .ind to encourage and enable
them to alleviate tlie situation,"
I lei n.Hides said.
I o this end, SP()()N, in con
junction with two other student
groups, organized National
I lunger and I lomelessness Week
during the week before I hanks
giving. SI*()()\ also hopes i<> kick
oil their campus outreach pro
grain tins year.
As senior Sylvia I.in, one ol the
volunteer coordinators, de
scribed, there is .1 limit to the re
sources at Stanford can provide
lor those who are hungn and in
need ol lood. With this in mind,
the SI'OON coordinators are
planning to c reate Â«i program that
will help other universities in the
Bav Area and around the nation
begin similar programs.
While SP()()\ w.is founded to
and continues to concentrate on
food waste and Inumer issues in

the local community, the organiza
tion also sees a need lor increasing
community awareness of the same
issues on the global sc ale.
Inspired by a "hunger ban
quet" that he attended last year at
I lannnet skjolcl House, sopho
more Avinash Kaza is leading
SPOON's ellorts to try to bring
hunger banquets to more dorms
on campus.
I he hunger banquet is meant
to in.ike participants tangibly (eel
the inequalities ol world food dis
tribution that they might not see in
their daily lives and even miss in
the abstraction of statistics. At the
beginning, participants draw tick
ets that determine which of the
high-, middle- or low income
meals they will be served at the
meal. I'lie tickets are distributed to
rellc( I the reality of world lood dis
tribution.
Fifteen percent ol participants
lincl themselves eating a luxurious
gourmet meal, silling alongside
the .SO percent representing the
middle-income population who
eat a simple meal ol rice and beans,
while a majority oft he participants
interspersed amongst them must
wait in line lor small portions of
rice <ind water. Members of
SPOON volunteer to help inter
ested dormitories host these
hunger banquets.
SPOON was (bunded by stu
dents in 1 'JS7 and funds its opera
lions through ASSI' special lees.

ing in SPOON's donation pro
