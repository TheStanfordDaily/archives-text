Is the teriyaki chicken or the vegetable
stir-fry better? Might as well take a
healthy serving of each uid leave the de
cision, along with the uneaten leftovers,
lot later.
The small decisions that students make
like this one add up to lots of wasted food.
In Florence Moore Hall alone, that
means more than 1,000 pounds of food
go to waste each week.
Last year, students involved in the
Stanford Project on Nutrition, more com
monly known by the acronym SPOON,
spent time weighing the half-eaten ham
burgers, untouched salads and other
foods that go to waste on the dirty-tray
racks of dining halls to come up with fig
ures like this one. This effort was part of a
larger and continuing effort by SPOON
to address food waste on campus.
According to SP()()N's Web site, Stan

lord, as an institution, is the Peninsula's
single largest consumer of food. SP()()N
members would like to see that it is not
also the Peninsula's largest squanderer of
food.
SP()()N's activities to meet this goal in
volve transferring food not served in the
dining halls and eating clubs on campus
to local food banks. (looks in participating
kitchens package cxt ess food in bags pro
vided by SP()()N. Each week, a volunteer
tomes by to pit k up the food and transfer
it to a central freezer. From there, it is dis
tributed to soup kitchens in Palo Alto.
SPOON works closely with two local
organizations, Urban Ministry and The
Bread of Life, to ensure thai this loot! gets
to those who are hungry.
SPOON is not on its own in the cru
sade. Dining hall managers are receptive
toSP()()N"scHorts and share their g<>al of
minimizing waste, project members said.
I 'heir donations provide several hundred
meals a week.

Bernice Woo, manager of the Florence
Moore Dining Facility, which does not
participate in the SPOON program,
claims that there is little waste from the
production side in Florence Moore
Dining.
"Accurate statistics of the number of
students at each meal are kept," she said,
"to gauge how much food should be pre
pared."
She went on to explain that whereas
dining services used to cook large
amounts of food ahead of time, they have
evolved toward a "just-in-time" approach
which minitni/es waste by preparing food
as it is needed.
Then is there a legitimate waste prob
lem? Yes, SPOON members said, al
though it stems from a source that is out
of their direct control: students.
"Much of the food waste in campus
dining halls is generated bv students who
