Between 100 ,iihl ">OO students visil Tresidder
Fitness (ienter each weekday, and ihe 101l of lieav\
usage on exercise equipment lias resulted in broken
machines that are rarely repaired.
" 1 lie mileage on the l>ikes averages well over
50.000 apiece and the stair machines average over
3,000 miles apiece," said facility manager lied
Stephens. "We run our machines to the ground,
and it's no fault ol ours, it's no fault of the students;
it's just that they're popular machines.'"
But gym-goers, lake heart: Stephens said eight
new st.iir machines and eight new bikes have finally
arrived and may be ready for use before winter
quarter begins.
Many frustrated exercisers will likch welcome
the new additions.

"Whenever I go [to Tresidder Fitness], just be
fore (linnet or near midnight, it's always crowded.
It wasn't that bad last year," said sophomore Marti
na Wang.
Among the most common problems ,tt I residder
Fitness is the number of non-operational machines
and the time it takes to repair them.
"I've had to wait for Stairmasters because so
many aren't wot king. | I he I residder Fitness staff]
said they'd be repaired soon but the\ weren't," said
sophomore Trevor Sutton.
Stephens acknowledges the need for more fre
quent and timely repairs.
"We do minor repairs but we need to have tech
nit iatis. We don't have the diagnostic tools or train
ing necessary," he said. "Under out contract [with

that the center has created more

congestion at Arrillaga.
I lie lack of space at Tresidder

she said. "[At I residdei Fitness]

I lie lack of space at Tresidder
