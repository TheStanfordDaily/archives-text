()n Nov. 28, 191)7, I lie Daily ran an arti
(lt* titled "Sororities refused recognition
for now."
"All seven sororities here have been de
nied I niversity recognition hut the I niver
sity has not closed the door on the subject.
Assoc. Dean of Student Allairs Norm Robin
son said yesterday.
"In detailed letters to each of the sororit\
presidents, Robinson outlined some ol the
areas in which lie saw a conflict between
I niversity policy and the poli< \ ofihe soror
ities and (heir national organizations...
"The decision todem recognition was
based on (lie general issue ol local autono
my, Robinson said. I he sorority constitu
tions contained 'clauses and provisions that
infringe on the ability ol the local group to
govern their own affairs," he s.iid.
" The sororities were evaluated individu
ally and none confbi med to I liiversitx
guidelines."
Bottom line: What would the Cowell Cluster be
like without the Tri-Delts, Thetas and Pi Phis? Men
of Zap and Terra breathe a sigh of relief.
