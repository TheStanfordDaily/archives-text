## Haiti opposition says Aristide has no mandate 
### 
I'( )R I -All-I'RINCK, Haiti (AI») — Opposi
tion parties that boycotted Haiti's presidential
vote claimed yesterday that near-certain victor
Jean-Bertrand Aristide has no mandate to gov
ern because most I laitians did not vote.
()pposition leader I lerve Denis said the coali
tion <>l all major opposition parties that urged
voters to shim tlie polls would create "a peaceful
alternative' to the government of Aristide and
his Laval.is Family party.
Denis, a limner allv of Aristide, refused to
elaborate. But it seemed Haiti's floundering
dernocracv could remain locked in a fight .for
power that has stymied development and for
eign aid and kit main I laitians as poor and hun
gry as ever.
I he electoral council, which opponents
charge is loaded with Aristide supporters, dis
puted claims ola low turnout and said (>O.. r > per

cent of more than I million registered voters par
ticipated. In some areas, they said, every regis
tered voter participated.
"They are hallucinating," Denis countered.
" Hie election was illegitimate. Aristide does not
have a mandate to govern. I he people's absten
tion means tliev refuse to be governed by
Lavalas." 1
()ne of Aristide's supporters offered an olive
branch to opponents.
"We want peace. We want the opposition to
have peace of mind. We need them, filings are
going to get better now," said Michel ()din, lead
ing about l()() revelers in a victory celebration.
Aristide confronts a mammoth task in keep
ing his election pledge of "Peace of mind, peace
in the belly" in this Caribbean nation, where
most of the S million people are unemployed
and illiterate.

Haiti's traditional aid donors — the United
States, France, Canada, the European Union
and the ()rganization of American States — have
warned tli.it a disputed presidential election
could raise questions about the legitimacy of
Aristide's government. 1 )onors threatened to cut
aid altera hotlv disputed vote count in legislative
elections in May.
Opposition parties have boycotted the pro
cess since May, charging it was rigged to ensure
Aristide's victory. That made Aristide's vic tory a
foregone conclusion, as he ran against six un
knowns who were too afraid to c ampaign.
Aristicle, Haiti's first freelv elected president,
wastoppled in a 1991 military coup and restored
to power alter a U.S.-led invasion in 1994.
Forced out in 199C> bv a constitutional ban on
consecutive terms, he handed power to his
hand-picked successor, Rene I'reval.
