## The 						Stanford Daily Stanford should promote awareness of labor issues 
### 
Published Since IS')I

Last Tuesday, the United
Farm Workers union ended its 16-
year-old boycott of California table
grapes. This should not mean,
however, that the discussion of labor issues
and workers' rights should cease. Indeed,
the time is ripe for the University to create
an ongoing forum for such discussion to
continue.
At Stanford, labor rights are usually dis
cussed only in specific regards to campaigns
initiated by student groups. The most pub
licized of these campaigns has been the one
fora grape boycott, which has received con
sistent attention for the past decade. Sup
porters of the boycott successfully drew
awareness of the working conditions of
grape pickers and persuaded the University
to acknowledge the issue.
However, the campaign fora grape boy
cott never influenced the University to ac-

knowledge — much less act upon — the
greater issue of labor rights. Nor did the
campaign for higher wages for janitors. Nor
did the nurses' strike.
As an academic institution, Stanford
has a duty to engage its students in issues
that pervade our society at large. Stanford
in particular has a duty to direct its re
sources toward to betterment <>l humani
ty, for this institution was created with that
goal in mind. As (ierharcl (lasper told the
Class of 2002 at its convocation: "()u
November 11, 1885, Leland and Jane
Stanford, 'desiring to promote the public
welfare," conveyed their Palo Alto farm lor
the purposes of a 'University of high de
gree' for both sexes."
It is not surprising that businesses often
lail to acknowledge poor working condi
tions. It is even less sin prising that business
es do not organize campaigns to improve

labor lights because their ultimate goal is
profit, not the amelioration of society. But
Stanford is not a corporation and by shying
away from labor issues, the I nivcrsity is not
serving its purpose.
1 lie I niversity must be aware of both
the role it has played in creating a wealthy,
but stratified Silicon Valley, as well as its
debt to the workers who maintain the
community.
I he end of the grape boycott will leave a
void on campus. The University should not
onlv lill this void, but also broaden and
deepen the discussion of labor issues on
campus. We suggest that the University pro
mote the discussion of labor issues during
orientation.
I he "Faces ol Stanford" presentation
could iii( lude the fat es of janitors. Alterna
tively, "Real Woi Id: Stanford" could have a
companion presentation, "Stanford in the

Real World." I I lis way, students could learn
right from the beginning about the issues
confronting campus landscapers, food
servers and other stall.
Stanford should also direct academic
resources toward the solution of labor
problems. This could include placing
labor issues in the curriculum of Intro
duction to Humanities, hiring professors
involved in the study of labor issues from
a social standpoint, or even the creation ol
an interdisciplinary academic program in
labor studies.
I hese measures may seem fantastic but
would really just be a lew small, and late,
steps towards fulfilling our Founders' ex
pectations. By Jailing to provide a Jorum for
the discussion of labor issues and lor ac
tivism on behalf ol labor issues, Stanford has
not lived up to its mission and the educa
tional needs ol its students.
