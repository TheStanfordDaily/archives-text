# I HAVE ISSUES
## The
						best years of our lives? 
### 
Whenever I'm around lo witness
Stanford's relative emptiness
over a holiday, I walk through
campus like some soil of discon
solate wanderer, feeling as il my comfortable
sense of permanence lias been destroyed.
I hat's because the limited permanence tli.it
Stanford provides <|iiickl\ breaks down once
the hustle and bustle ol itsdav-to-dav activities
disappears. I his is not the case when I'm at
home; even il I'm all alone in mv house, I still
get a cozy at-home feeling simply b\ passing
out on the living-room sofa while watching al-

tertioon talk shows.
The difficulty ol gain
ing a sense of perma
nence at Stanford is not
Stanford-specific, but,
rather, symptomatic ol
college life in general. In
high school, a lot of peo
ple told me how great col
lege would be. I hey said
tli.it my college years
would be the best years of

my life and that I would meet my greatest
friends I here.
I can't say vet that those people were
wrong, although just as many people said
high school would be the Ik-si years ofm\ life
— ,ind I know those people were wrong. I cer
tainly have made great friends at Stanford
and, in general. I have had a good time here.
Nevertheless, I'm not so sure that college is es
pe< ially conducive to either being happy or
building deep friendships.
It seems that everyone in college is in a con
stant state of flux. Even the most driven pre
meds are not completely sure they w ill end up
in medical school. Most of us simply pretend
we know what we're doing for the sake of our
parents (and pet haps fbrourdignih when we
talk to those pre-meds). (College is a period in
whit h we incessantly question ourselves and
envision the future as a big black storm cloud
looming overhead, threatening to break am
moment.
There's nothing wrong with this per

spective. because(<tllege should be this wa\.
Because the real world offers no such thing
as universal equal opportunity (objectivist
arguments aside), we are fbrtuiiate enough
to attend a school whose degree will allow
us to do essentialh whatever we want upon
graduation. I his is a privilege provided to
very lew.
Furthermore, I consider it an insult to
those who lack this privilege loi us to waste
our educationally enhanced power ol < lie>ice
In blindlv throwing ourselves into undesir
able careers simplv because it's expected.
I here are virtually limitless options out there
lor Stanford students, and we owe it to our
selves to take the time to figure out which op
tion is best lor each ol us.
But, this decision-making process is
hardly liin. To be honest, it's the opposite
of lun. I don't c are how many siinm Stan
lord lac es I see whi/ving l>\ on shiny bikes
all allurry with Colgate-caliber smiles, ut
tering efficient, ever-friendly greetings.
Despite the plioii) laid-back atmosphere
that Stanford students desperateh ir\ to
project, much of college lile is psychologi
cal agonizing because human beings do
lie >i enjoy feeling as if they have no sense of
permanence. I he opportunity lo shape
our lives is a tremendous privilege, but it is
also a hardship.
In addition to the lack of permanence
and burden ol potential, I can't help feeling
that the foundation upon which main col
lege friendships rest .is a bit shaky. I must
admit that college is a good place to make
friends because no pervasive family influ
ence exists here. This situation facilitates in
tense I Minding between friends that often oc
curs in an amazingly short amount ofiiine.
However, this lac k ol family inlluence is
problematic as well. I know th.it I take every
opportunity to meet my friends families and
visit their homes because I don't leel as il I c an
truly know someone unless I've seen where
and with whom they grew up. Indeed, I be
lieve that it is impossible to obtain a good sense
of who I am without becoming at least a little

acquainted with im liunilv.
Yet the lad ili.it I live miles away
Irom Stanlord lias presented .1 problem in
this respect. I can. however, attest that my
closest Iriends know ,1 great deal about me
even though most ol them haven't met niv
family.
I lie point is Ill.lt building lasting relation
ships re<|tiires a great deal ol lime. I here
seems lo he a push 111 the Irishman year to
111, ike as 111 am Iriends as possible as soon .is
possible. I Ins results 111 one having .1 nuilii
tude ol solid acquaintances but /ero intimate
friendships. I he net effect is a loneliness thai
many are eager to hide.
When I look ba( k at niv lime at Stanlord.
I'll probably join my predecessors 111 pro

nouncing college to be the best years ol niv
life, liut while I don't think exaggerating the
positive qualities ol .1 past event is so wrong, I
do believe it's extremely problematic to ovet
estimate the positive nature ol the present.
When the expectations ol what the typical col
lege student should leel are set 100 high, the
perceptions of ac iu.il college students become
distorted.
I bis expectation gap leads individuals to
sillier frustration and disappointment more
than they would il they had embarked 011 the
college experience with realistic expectations
or, ideally, none at all. I he same thing hap
pens every holiday season when people be
come depressed because they fail to experi
ence the unrealistic expectations ol jo\ aucl

cheer broadcast by the media.
At Stanford, the distortions may be even
worse because, for whatever reason, so many
people seem obsessed with keeping up an ap
pcaraiK e ol happiness, thereby perpetuating
<ind reinforcing the college fantasy. I'm not
saying we have to wear'black and read Russian
literature. I his would just be putting up an
other facade. Hut perhaps we could abandon
the unnecessary struggle to appear so sunny
•iiid bring our expectations and perceptions
of life .it Stanford ba( k down to earth.
