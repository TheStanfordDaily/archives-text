Daily perpetuates double standard on
Mideast political ads
It was very disappointing to see a
double standard on political advertise
ments come out in yesterday's Daily.
Over the past lew weeks, Islamic
groups have paid to place pro-Pales
tinian copy in The Daily. These adver
tisements were framed by bold-faced
type along the top and bottom assuring

readers that the messages were paid ad
vertisements .md did not represent the
opinions held by I he Stanford Daily.
Today, a full-page pro-Israeli mes
sage appeared with no disclaimer, no
indication that it was a paid advertise
ment <ind worse, it was positioned with
in the paper on page five, which regu
larly carries supplemental opinion
columns. Is this to indicate that The
Daily is taking a pro-Israeli statue, or

did the newspaper believe that some
how a pro-Israeli position is less con
troversial or offensive to Stanford read
ers?
II it is not intending to openly de
dare support lor the Israeli cause, then
I lie Dailv must get rid o! tins double
standard.
