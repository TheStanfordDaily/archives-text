### GREG BRAZEAL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
I he Santa ( lai a (lount\ Hoard of Supervisors
presented a coinpromise plan for Stanford's ex
pansion yesterdav morning that included the ad
dition of a "Sustainabilit) Study" hallway
through Stanford's development plans. Univer
sit\ oflic ials expressed a cautious optimism that
the Board's official (let ision on 1 )ec. 12 would be
acceptable to all concerned.
" I think it's a good agreement for everybody,"
I niversitv President John Hennessy said. "I
11111 ik it's a good balance of both what Stanford
would have liked and what other members of the
community would like.
I he proposal would give Stanford permission
to build i lit' full 2 million square feel of academ
ic facilities and 3.018 units of housing it has re
quested for the next 10 years. It would also cre
ak' an Academic (Irowth Boundary to prevent
Stanlord from building any new developments
in the foothills for the next 25 years.
In a unanimous vote, the Board endorsed a
proposal l>\ Supervisor Joe Simitian requiring
the I niversitx to commission a "Sustainability


NEMIL DAIAL/The Stanford Daily
Study' belore beginning the sec
ond ball <>l its academic construc
tion. The study would determine
the absolute limits of sustainable
growth on Stanford's lands. By
promoting compact urban devel
opment and preventing "sprawl
into tlie hillsides" above Junipero
Sena Boulevard, the study
would ensure that the Universitv
does not continue doubling in
si/e every 25 years â€” as it has lor
the last 50.
According to Simitian, the
si udy could provide as much pro
tection for Stanford's open spaces
as his previous proposal fora 99-
year Foothill development ban.
"In order for that second mil
lion square leet of academic facil
ities to come on-line, there lias to
be an agreement" between Stan
lord and the County, Simitian
said. "I think that gives the Uni
versity some pretty significant en
couragement to get to a good
place with the (loiinty."
Stanford Director ol Govern
ment and Community Relations
Lain llorton suggested that the
sustainabilitv studv could lead to

another lengthy controversy over
Stanford's open spaces in live or
six years. He questioned the wis
dom of requiring a study halfway
through Stanford's General Use
Permit, the planning document
that will control development
over the next decade.
"We were perfectly prepared
and think it would have been ap
propriate to have |.i sustainability
study] submitted when we submit
a new GU 1\" I lorton said.
Stanford's next GUP applica
tion will probably happen
around 2010. "But before ili.it
time it lias no applic ability. It will
simply mean that we have a
process like this one in the mid
dle of our GUP, and 1 don't think
that's positive."
Simitian was more optimistic.
"My hope and expectation is
that . . . the University will be
working with the County to say,
'I fere are our views about how we
can prevent sprawl into the
Foothills,' and that by the time
tliev get to that millionth square
foot, there will already have been
a resolution," he said.
Peter Drekmeier of the Stan
ford ()pen Space Alliance, an en
vironmental group that pushed
for permanent Foothills preser

vation, expressed a tempered sat
isfaction with ilit* outcome <>l the
lb-month debate over Stanford's
development plans. I lie alliance
claims to have collected over
I ">,()()() signatures in support of a
permanent end to development
m the Foothills.
"I think it's a step in the right
direction," he said of the board's
proposal. "Ii used to be that Stan
lord got everything they wanted.
Now they just gel most of what
they wanted."
The proposal is largely similar
to previously released recom
mendations from the County's
Planning ('.ommission, except lor
a lew modifications added yester
day by Simitian. In addition lo
the sustainabilit) study, Siniit
ian's changes include the cre
ation of a "Special Conservation
Plan" for highly sensitive areas in
the Foothills and the designation
of the entire Foothills as a"I lill
side Zoning District."
Morton said thai it remained
unclear exactly what a "Hillside
Zoning District" designation might
require of Stanford, but I )reknieier
o lie red a tentative interpretation.
"Essentially what the hillside
/oiling would allow, we would
guess, il it's consistent with (.01111-

Tv policy, is that the\ might be al
lowed to develop 10 percent of
the Foothills . . . and set aside ( .)0
percent as open spat e, he said.
I lie board's proposal .ilso clil
fered from the Planning Com
mission's earlier recommenda
tions by setting more rigid re
quirements on the portion of new
housing that will have to go to
low-income service workers.
Simitian presented the re
quirement .is ,1 wa\ lo ensure that
new housing does not go entirely
to students and faculty.
"The question is, how can we
make sure there's a place for the
pot-scrubber, the broom-pusher,
the clerk typist, the data entr\
person, the secretary fora de
partment," lie said. "How do we
make sure that there's a place for
them to live? We've made <1 mod
est step in the right direction."
"We're somewhat disappoint
ed that post-dots and medical
residents were discriminated
against, pulling them out of the
affordable housing," I lcnness\
said.
II the proposal passes in its
current form, the University
would be required to dedic ate 15
pert cut of all new housing to low
income workers.
