### JOHN SHASANMI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford ranks second behind
Ml 1 among the most susceptible
< ollcgcs and universities to laptop
I licit, according to lock manufac
turer Kr\ptonitc (Corporation, but
Stanford polite have questioned
the ranking.
Although Krvptonite claimed
to have conia< ted some hundreds
ol colleges and universities around
the nation, Li. Del Bandy, investi
gating commander al the Stanford
Sheriffs Ollice, said he hadn't
heard from the companv.
"I don't know where Kryp
tonitc got their information. It's
ama/ing to mc because even we
don't have that information,
Handy said.
Bandy, who is in charge of
maintaining police records and
the Department of Public Saletv's
databasing, said the department
doesn't keep track ol laptop theli
specilicalh.
"We do keep track of all com
puter-related thefts from ( hips to

mainframes — we've never had
one <>l lhose — to monitors. The
onl\ way lo figure out the number
of laptop thefts is to go over the
whole database one by one."
According to Bandy, the past
lour wars have seen a decline in all
reported instances of'computer re
lated thefts. There were 59 thefts
repot ted in 199(i, (i2 in 1997,48 in
1998 and 'A7 in 1999. So far, this
year s total is ;it 45. The Sheriffs
Office does not keep track'of re
covery statistics.
In a press release, kryptonite
( T.f) (lan Fursi s.iid the company
has worked with campus security
officers for nearly three decades to
lollow the crime trends on cam
puses nationwide.
"We know that laptop theft at
colleges .iikl universities will only
continue to rise as more students
are required to have them," Furst
said.
Ftlian Rikleen, the network sys
tems administrator for Residential
Computing, said that there isn't
much of a threat at St an lord, e< "lin
ing Handv's comments.
" I here isn't much laptop
theft," kikleen said. "In fact,
there isn't much computer thelt
at all ... 1 can't think ol any stu
dent who lost their laptop be
cause it lias been stolen."
Junior Klita (Iheung said she
wasn't surprised at kryptonite's
rankings. Earlier this year, a thief
broke into her Okada room and
stole her Palm Pilot and cellular
phone, but leli her laptop, whi< b
was locked to her desk. She said
that students should "definitely"
take precautious to prevent lap
top i hell.
"I remember last year people
got theirs stolen, especially peo
ple on the liisi lloor," she said.
"The lock is about $40, but it's
worth it."

Michael Ponikvar, a freshman,
agreed with (Iheung that there is
.1 false sense of security on the
Stanford campus, encouraging
many not to lo< k their laptops.
"There's the whole honor
code," he said. "People think.
People don't do that here, it's
Stanford.' "
Ponikvar says that despite
warnings and the Kryptonite
findings, he does not keep his
laptop locked. "1 used to, but 1
don't anymore," he said. "It's
such a pain ... I guess I could
put (the lock] on, but I move
around a lot and it would be kind
of annoying."
He added that a lock would
not deter a determined thief. "If
it's just kids walking by the win
dow, then it doesn't matter. But if
it's someone looking to steal a
laptop, 1 1 icy can just cut the wire
and take it."
