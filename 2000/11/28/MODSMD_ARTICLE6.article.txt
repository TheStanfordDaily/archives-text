# Chaparral's Old Boys reflect on a century of controversial humor
## 
### MICHAEL R. FAINELLI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In 18VM), the same year that the first
( lump of sod was scooped out lot the con
struction of Memorial Church, Stanford
students picked up the lirst issue ol the
Chaparral, a humor magazine. On the
(over they lound .111 emaciated, goateed
(ester wearing a striped suit and a fool's
cap tipped with bells.
Maybe Bristow Adams, founder of the
( happie, didn't know it at the lime, but his
creation would last into a new millennium.
I he Chaparral, named alter the scrubby
underbrush found in the Foothills, would
even outlast The Stanford Sequoia, a pre
tentious literary magazine that originally

inspired Adams to invent a humorous
counterpart.
Beneath the fool's cap
Though the |ester is alive and well
today, he had to survive dark days that
threatened Ins survival. But through it all,
the ( happie has been sustained by a series
of editors who go bv the name "()ld Boy.
Today, two juniors, Jacob Young and
Gideon Lewis-Klaus, share the Old Boy
title. Together they make an odd but effec
tive couple. Young, an Fnglish and psy
chology' major, grew up i<il! and clean-cut in
Fort Wayne, Ind. and has a gentle, Mid
western disposition, perfect lor nurturing
new talent. Lewis-Kraus hails from a sub
urb close to New York City and his dark

eyes radiate with energy. I he son of'rahhis.
he speaks in well-< rafted sentences that re
veal a thorough knowledge <>l philosophy
and literature.
Both these men rose to the top as much
by virtue of their commitment as their
coniedic gills, and along the way, hoili have
submitted an untold number ol rejected
pieces. As editors, they devote about 20
hours a week to the Chappie. In the week
belore a new issue goes to print, the com
mitment shoots up to about 70 hours.
In the most recent issue, they authored
about hall ol the :i. r > published pieces. Not
only do they write, critique and edit, but
they do the thousands ol liftle< bores that go
along with running a publication: coaching
inexperienced stall members, reminding

writers about meetings and dea< Nines, vacu
uming I he ollices and silling lb rough inter
views with the press.
Part ol what inspires the ()ld Hoys is
pride in ;i < enlurv s worth ol tradition, and
il is,i pasi worth remembering.
lo begin with, the magazine lias
launched an astonishing number of' Sta
nford stats. Adams, the founder himself,
went on lo establish the ( ornell School ol
|ournalism. I here was (ioodwin Knight,
who served asgovernoi ol (ialilornia. Ilriu e
Bliven became an earls edijoi .it Ihe New
Republic. I)isnc\ .irtisis. ,i few Hollywood
moguls, writers for "'lhe Simpsons" and
"Saturday Night Live," even Sigourney
Weaver lor a brief slim — .ill were part ol
the ( happie during their college yeai s.

Dark days for the Chappie
A brief look at I lie history of the (Chap

resilience. I he magazine endured a shut

In 1961. editor Brad Kfron was sus

Indeed, the entire ()l<l Ho\ net

70 people lor the annual reunions.

()nl\ the handful ol (.happies
who put in the most hours each
veat get into 1 lammcr and ( ollin,
.ind as «i final lesi of lovalty they
have to pull a prank. I he most fa

mous stunt was the Dead Howlers
prank ol I MO. ()ne ol the initiates,
posing as a Daily editor, rushed
into the Daily presses at live in the
morning and inserted a fake pic
ture ol the bowling team, showing
seven young men proudly bran
dishing theii polished trophies.
Right underneath a caption said
the entite team had perished in a
plane c rash at 11:42 p.m. I lie out
rageous headline pun, " Tragedy
Sit ikes Howling I earn," was meant
to tip oil the readers, but the next
morning the Daih phones were
ringing oil the hook and students
were weeping and consoling each
other in the streets.
I he Old Hoys admit to publish
ing pieces in each issue that they
know will bomb with most stu
dents. I hat ma\ sound like.* the
wrong strategy lot the editors ola
student magazine, but the liberal
submissions polio gives budding
writers the room to make mistakes
and push the limits of their own
creativity.
"You have to do enough self-in
dulgent stiill to keep yourselves in
terested and creative," Lewis-
Kraus said. "Sometimes vou have
to lorsake the lormulaic stuff that
ma\ be realh funny in lavorof stuff
that can't be pigeonholed and is
going to be compelling for us as
creators."
I wo pieces from the latest
issue which exemplifv the split
personality of the (lhappie.
(ioing lor the big laughs, "Had
Sexual Role Playing (lames'' lists
a bunch ol gross couplings such
as ".Americ an Soldier and 7 year
old Vietnamese gill" and "Jim
(aow and Martin Luther King,
Jr."
" I lie sell indulgent stull'," as
the( )ld Hoys call it, is exemplified
by a piece in the same issue called
"The Staple Whisperer." It con
tains poetic imager) much hard
er to digest than the sexual
humor of bad role-playing
games.
" I loved it, but I can't imagine the
bulk ol the campus Ibund it partic u
larl\ funny, Lewis-Kraus savs. Hut
bv selling aside space lor the stull ol
literar\ sell-indulgence, the ( hap

pic iis iu'l over <i much largei

stallcrs the license to (liase oui iheii
creative impulses.

Meeting time
Kverv Wednesday night after
dinner, the Chappies llock to the
ollicc, pen bed just over the Daily
headquarters on the second Hoot
<>1 the Storkc Publications build
ing. Its a large, niiistv room filled
with the in pe ol iaggeclx furniture
ili.it N'ou'd leave up lor grabs on
the side of the road.
flic ollicc is cluttered Nvitli
poster advertisements for Jack
Daniels, empty tans ol Coors
Light, stolen street signs — a real
mess. Hut there's a sense that be
hind countless damages in the
room — the charcoal color burns
and < law marks on the ceiling, the
mutilated Venetian blinds, the
holes in the n\all. the dark stains on
the carpel —or the hundreds of
pieces of memorabilia — the lilc-

Si/ed black collin, the hangman's
noose hanging from the ceiling,
the Playboy coffee cup set
there's a century's worth of funm
stories.
"It feels like you're part of
something," senior Hen Willong
said. "Kvcn just In coining here
and seeing the back issues, you
know it will live on."
Calhered in the meeting room
with Axl Rose wailing in the back
ground, the Old Pons and their
brethren let loose in a comedic bull
session to discuss ideas for the next
issue. I here are some lile-01-thc
party types, but the Chappie at
tracts a surprising number ol
c|iiiet, somewhat siin people who
can c burn out good pieces but who
don't perform like stand-up
comics.
Young and Lewis-kraus pre
side over the meeting from a con

pie <>l eas\ chairs and provide a
table lull ol boxed wine, keystone
Premium, vodka and even KAN
ABs lo loosen up the tongue. A
joll\ stall 'party can get the creative
juices Mowing and provide the in
spiration for good pieces — that's
the idea.
"|The Chappie) is runniest
when people are comfortable with
each other." said Brent Fit/gerald,
a senior who does layout lor the
maga/ine.
Man\ at the meeting and many
ol the f)8 people listed on the ( hap
pie masthead have never put pen
to paper for the maga/ine. 1 he( )ld
Bovs wrote about half the pieces in
the last article, and a small tore ol
('.happies wrote much ol the rest.
" I here are a lot ol people who
don't realh write but hang out
here. We consider them friends of
the (lhappie," 1 .ewis-Kraus said.
