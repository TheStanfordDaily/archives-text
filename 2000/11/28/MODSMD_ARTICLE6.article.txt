### MICHAEL R. FAINELLI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In 18VM), the same year that the first
( lump of sod was scooped out lot the con
struction of Memorial Church, Stanford
students picked up the lirst issue ol the
Chaparral, a humor magazine. On the
(over they lound .111 emaciated, goateed
(ester wearing a striped suit and a fool's
cap tipped with bells.
Maybe Bristow Adams, founder of the
( happie, didn't know it at the lime, but his
creation would last into a new millennium.
I he Chaparral, named alter the scrubby
underbrush found in the Foothills, would
even outlast The Stanford Sequoia, a pre
tentious literary magazine that originally

inspired Adams to invent a humorous
counterpart.
Beneath the fool's cap
Though the |ester is alive and well
today, he had to survive dark days that
threatened Ins survival. But through it all,
the ( happie has been sustained by a series
of editors who go bv the name "()ld Boy.
Today, two juniors, Jacob Young and
Gideon Lewis-Klaus, share the Old Boy
title. Together they make an odd but effec
tive couple. Young, an Fnglish and psy
chology' major, grew up i<il! and clean-cut in
Fort Wayne, Ind. and has a gentle, Mid
western disposition, perfect lor nurturing
new talent. Lewis-Kraus hails from a sub
urb close to New York City and his dark

eyes radiate with energy. I he son of'rahhis.
he speaks in well-< rafted sentences that re
veal a thorough knowledge <>l philosophy
and literature.
Both these men rose to the top as much
by virtue of their commitment as their
coniedic gills, and along the way, hoili have
submitted an untold number ol rejected
pieces. As editors, they devote about 20
hours a week to the Chappie. In the week
belore a new issue goes to print, the com
mitment shoots up to about 70 hours.
In the most recent issue, they authored
about hall ol the :i. r > published pieces. Not
only do they write, critique and edit, but
they do the thousands ol liftle< bores that go
along with running a publication: coaching
inexperienced stall members, reminding

writers about meetings and dea< Nines, vacu

views with the press.
Part ol what inspires the ()ld Hoys is
pride in ;i < enlurv s worth ol tradition, and
