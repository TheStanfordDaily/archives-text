Inside Room No. 243 on a recent
weekend, three roommates take study
breaks by cycling through some of the
nearly 50 episodes of "The Simp
sons" they have stored on their com
puters . ... And from seemingly every
open door songs collected through the
online service Napster blare from the
desktop machines.
This is Toy on Ha IK a largely sopho
more dormitory on the palm-tree
adorned campus of Stanford Univer
sity, a school whose tech prowess has
helped define Silicon Valley but that
recently, like many other academic in
stitutions nationwide, has come to
represent some corporations' vision of
the new-economy apocalypse.
â€” from the Nov. 24 issue of
The Washington Post
