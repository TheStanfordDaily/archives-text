### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Supreme Court should "forestall an im
pending constitutional crisis" by rolling
back the election clock in Florida, lawyers
lot George W. Bush argued yesterday,
while Al (lore's lawyers said the court
should not interfere.
Bush, whose appeal the high court will
hear Friday, said the justices can bring
"legal finality" to the presidential election
by overturning the Florida courts and
ending any further ballot recounts.
At issue are Florida's decisive 25 elec
toral votes, which were awarded Sunday
night to Bush. (lore is lighting to overt urn
results of the Florida election and claim
those electoral votes, and with them the
White 1 louse.
Florida's Republican-led Legislature
opened hearings yesterday into the possi
bility of selecting its own slate ol presiden
tial electors. Willi the legal slaius of the
Florida election still in limbo, it is possible
that two different sets of electors could
claim legitimacy in Florida.
"Reversal by this Court would restore
the legislatively crafted method lor ap
pointing electors in Florida to its status
prior to November 7, would allow the
completion ol the proper selection of pres
idential electors in Florida according to the

plan contemplated l>v die Constitution,
and would aid in bringing legal finality to
this election," Bush's attorneys wrote.
(lore's team called t he Republican argu
ments "insubstantial" and said the Florida
court "played a familiar and quintessential
ly judicial role" in interpreting state law.
They asked the just ices to affirm the ruling
and avoid trampling on what is supposed
to be a matter ol state law.
"Principles of federalism counsel
strongly against interference by this
court,"the (lore legal team said in its brief.
At the same time, the vice president is
asking a Florida judge to undo the secre
tary ol stale's certification that Bush is the
winner. That certification came Sunday,
after the Supreme Court agreed to take-
Bush's appeal.
II the justices think I hey do not have
enough left to decide, they could opt not
to hear the case after all. Bush's filings yes
terday, however, argued that the court
still has a role to play.
Bush asked the justices to overturn a
Florida Supreme Court ruling that al
lowed hand recounting of votes to contin
ue past a state imposed deadline of Nov.
14, saying the manual reviews opened the
door for I)emocrat (lore to continue legal
contests for weeks more.
