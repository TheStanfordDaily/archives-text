JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel's parlia
ment voted overwhelmingly yesterday to
hold new elections, alter Prime Minister
Ehud Barak — his government shaken
by iwo months of street battles with the
Palestinians — reluctantly agreed to
hard-liners' demands for an early vote.
Polls have shown elections would be a
risky proposition lor Barak, as his minori
ty government has been steadily losing
support from many Israelis who perceive
him as ineffective in ending the bloodshed.
I lowever, a vote would probably not be
held before spring, giving Barak time fora
last-ditch ellort lo forge a peace agreement
with the Palestinians. Elections could serve
as a referendum on the agreement.
The 120-member legislature voted
separately on live bills (ailing lor early
elections. Four of the bills were approved
by more than 70 members of the house.
()nly three legislators were opposed, and
the rest abstained.
The date lor elections will be set in the
coming days by party leaders.
Parliament had settled into a long de
bate on the live bills yesterday evening
when Barak made an unexpected appear
ance before the lawmakers. In a speech,
Barak announced that he would no longer
resist the opposition push lor elections.
"I do not flinch from elections. 1 say il
you want elections, let there be elections
lor prime minister and for the Knesset,"
Barak told parliament.
After Barak's surprise announcement,
(he prime minister met with legislators and
Cabinet ministers ol his One Israel align
ment to explain his unexpected move.
Someol the party members reported
ly were embittered because Barak had
not consulted them. Israel radio said

Avraham Burg, the parliament speaker
and a leading One Israel figure, was con
sidering challenging Barak as the party's
candidate for prime minister in the up
coming elections.
Israeli commentators said Barak's
only chance to remain in power was lo
reach a peace agreement. "Ehud Barak
is running in the election without a gov
ernment, without a majority in the Knes
set, without a majority in the polls and
without a majority of the public," said
Hanan Crystal, a political analyst. "He is
running on one issue only, whether he is
capable of reaching an agreement with
Yasser Arafat by election day."
U.S. officials said the developments

were not unexpected. P.J. Crowley,
spokesman for President Clinton's Na
tional Security Council, said: "This has
been conjectured in Israel for some time,
so I don't know we were surprised by it,"
Crowley said. "It is an internal matter."
U.S. officials said yesterday after
Barak's announcement, the Clinton ad
ministration will concentrate on trying to
curb the fighting between Israel and the
Palestinians, now in its third month.
"Barak still has six months until the
coming elections, and if he wants, he can
stop his aggression and adopt a new pol
icy that will enable him to go to his peo
ple with progress in the peace process,"
Shaath said.
