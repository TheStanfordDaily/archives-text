tally, selling essays to papers Hess is not a viola
tion ol the Fundamental Standard an>ordingto
the site's stated purpose. But the likelihood ol
plagiarism by the pun basing party is too high.
As students, we have a responsibility to ap

cussions of our actions. Selling essays to pa
pers lless is not a noble idea. Despite its claim to
further research and academic dialogue, the
site undermines the purpose of education. In
deed. the purpose of education is not to take
the easy wav out; it is to integrate the process of
learning into individuals' dailv lifestyles.
With one ( lit k and a < ledit card charge, pa
pers lless undermines the entire process of re
search and learning — the process that is often
infinitely more instructive than the final prod
uct itself.
