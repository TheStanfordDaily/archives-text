## Scottish-American love

I made 11 22 veais without writing
about my personal lile, hut tliei
something big happened recentl\ 11
(i (>ss-Atlanti< relations, and m\ lami
1\ plaved ,i \ it al i < >le.

fiancee wed in .1 three-da) Scottish-Aineii
( an (elebration on the \<>i 111 Sea coast.
1 he best part about getting mat 1 ied lai
from home — even better than avoiding

any problems with l<><,il
ordinances or pesk\
neighbors — is that onl\
the people \<>u want to
see at your wedding are
going to come. All those
co-workers and relatives
whom you invite onh
out of a sense ol dut\
have an eas\ excuse not
to make it. "Sorry. I'd

love to come, but von know how hard it istc
get away this time ol'vear . .
(ireat!
()n< e t hat cousin ol vours who sells steak
knives do<>r-to-d< >< »i gi ,k i< >nsl\ dec lines his
invitation, you phone another college
buddy. "(iood news, another relative's out.
You're invited!" l'rett\ s(K)u, vou're living
in an elite corps ol boo/ehouncls and so
cialites from around the globe, .1 veritable
Special Forces ol Fun to celebrate youi
wedding.
My brothet ollered his f.iithliil legion
aires a single morsel ol .td\ k e be lore \vc set
out amid whiske\ and bagpipestodobatlle
with some of "Scotland linest partiers: "Re
member, you're representing yout
country 1 ."
I he wedding da\ began with <1 < eremo
nv at Saint Man's (lathcdral. I he (iatholic
M ass has always impressed me with lis
pleasant mixing of autlioi ih ind anan hv.
Any given Sunday morning, ,is the priest
repeats the same sa< red riles tli.it have en
dured two millennia, it is not uncommon
to heat a < lion ol < ry ing t odd lei s sounding
out, or. in urban environs, to have a drunk
ard pass out in.in adja< eni pew 01 even to
catch glimpse ola stra\ dog meandering
past the altar. An absent-minded priest
chopping a prayer book is commonplacc.
Still, the Mass proceeds with the most ap
propriate indillercncc toward human
frailty.
Friday's marriage cereinom was no dil
ferent. I he lector must have been sur
prised to discover th.it the petitions he had
been called to read had nevei been wi itten
m the first place. Yet alter a moment ol
helpless glances back toward the priest, lie
went alxnit authoring Ins own petitions.
"And, um, let us pra\ 10r..." Luckily,

there's alwa\s enough to prav f<>l in tins
W(>i Id.
I he < eremom was peppered with Scots
in kills, \evet before had I known that it's
< ustoman to earn a daggei lucked neatl\
111 1 lie right s<h k while wearing a kill. I Ins
added a small vxrinkle to the proceedings
Ik'c auseii meant dial each groomsman had
10 < 1 oss to the starboard side <>1 his brides
maid I iclorc escorting I lei out I lie church.
When someone asked win no Scot walks
with his esc < 111 to his right. the priesi duh
explained," In case he needs Io reach (01 his
sword."
I he theatrical high-water maik ola
Scottish wedding reception is. without
doubt, the presentation ol the haggis. I he
haggis enters niidwa\ through the meal,
preceded l>\ the sounds ol bagpipes. Ii is
absoluielx delicious, especialls when
splashed with a touch ol whiskc\.
< )ik e the meal's final c ourses were (011-
siuned, the guests made their was to the
dance lloor. Apparentlv. counii v-weslcrn
line dancing has Scottish roots. I lie lirsi
dances were (jiiile formal, even il their par
tic ipanis weren't. As the night progressed,
and lies were loosened then lost, utter bed
lam eniei ged. I he line-dances became an
arch v; killed Scots r< nnpei I about the dance
llooi carrying my brother 011 their
shoulders.
Speec lies were given, toasts made and,
linalh. a ( hallenge was <iflered.
I he Scots, gathered arm-in-arm, bell
ed theii national anthem. As il on cue,
lhe Americans rcsp<mcled wit ha rousing
version ol oui "Sia 1 Spangled Banner."
Afterwards, in a moment that would
have had even the most hardened inter
national peacemaker reaching foi Ins
Kleenex, both sides collapsed logelhei 111
the center ol the dance lloor as we
hugged and decided which bats we
would \ 1 sit later on.
Meanwhile, I clenched a Montecristo
and a glass ol < hainpagnc, and cnjoved one
of those Heeling moments when m\ gradu
ate school applications and thesis topic
seemed so fat out of mind. Il was ultimate
catharsis.
A student sol,ll from his books leh oddl\
at home; a couple, ncwlv wed. seemed to
have been logelhei lorever. I recalled the
w<>l dsol the poel I .S. Kliol: "Weshould not
< ease from exploration And the end of (nn
exploration/ Will be to arrive where we
ll ave stalled/ And know the place lor tlie
fii si liine."
