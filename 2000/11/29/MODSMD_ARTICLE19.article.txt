# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Regulations have gone beyond safety: Liberty is in peril 
### DAVID S. ABRAMS GUEST COLUMNIST 
Main people see Thanksgiving
as .1 chance lor bizarre an
thropological study oI a
group ol" "family members."
I, in m\ less intellectual moments (alter
the serious hour-long discussion ol the
various uses ol gluten), rellecled 011 the
state ol our nation. I 11 is year I contem
plated the state ol individual freedoms in
this country, inspired l>\ a number ol
bothersome recent observations.
Americans are regulating themselves
more and more, .is well as enforcing old
laws to a nm< li greater extent. I Ins ma\
lead to a saler societx. but at what cost?
One nationallx renowned example ol
tins increase in law enforcement has
arisen in New York Citx under the ad
mi nisi ration ol Ylavor Rudolph (•iuliani.

size and activitv ol the police force is, pre
sumable to decrease ci ime rates.
Indeed, crime rates have dropped in
New York ('.it v in a broad 1 angc ol'cate

gories. But this decline has coincided
with a period of tremendous economic
prosperity. which weakens the argument
ill.ll the changes in the polite lone are
the sole reason for the drop in dime.
Still, there is a consensus that at least
some ol (iiuliani's elloris have made a
difference — but it has come at a price.
In articles, discussions with residents
and personal observations, the compari
son between New York C litx and a police
stale has come up numerous times. Cer
lainlv tliis is hyperbolic, but there are and
should be legitimate concerns about the
increased presence ol law enforcement in
the average New Yorker's daily life.
I Ins is uoi just about extreme cases
like the Diallo shooting or (lie Louima
abuse. I he police are intervening 111 peo

111 si having excess numbers of law en
forcement officers can be problematic.

Natural concerns about my past incar
ceration aside (seven years in San
Quentin), I personally lelt bothered by
seeing clusters of police totaling several
do/en in a one to two block area of 1 imes
Square. 1 hat police presence is deemed
necessan even though the region has
been < archills saniti/.ed and Disneylied.
