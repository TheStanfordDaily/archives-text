### MALCOLM LEVINE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last weekend the Cardinal
squash team boldly ventured Last
to play lour higher tanked teams
in the New York area.
I he Cardinal, hindered by in
juries and a severe case of jet lag,
faced an uphill battle against these
more experienced teams but per
formed well enough to merit a
jump in the National Intercolle
giate Squash Racquet Association's
next national tanking.
No. Stanford went 1 -lion the
four-game trip, beating No. 24
Rochester, while losing to No. 20
Hobart, No. 23 lulls and No. 2b
('< >lgate.
I In- ('.ardinal hobbled onto the
plane a team depleted In injury.
The team's No. 1 player, Steven
Wei, was so sic k he couldn't even
make the trip. No. 2 seniot Jason
Miller played with a pulled ham
string and julien ( '.hi/ was also out
w itli a severely sprained ankle.
.According to Miller, who also
serves as the team's treasurer,
"The team wasn't expecting a
whole lot." I lie team's main goals
were, "to gain some experience ...
and most importanth. to show the
l ast Coast that we are a serious
program."
I he ('.ardinal had an inauspi
< ions beginning to the trip. Still re
covering from a treacherous red
eve Might that included a stopover,
and a two-hour drive from litiHalo
to Hobart (College, Stanford stum
bled out of the gates, flat and un
prepared to plav the toughest
team of the trip. 1 he ('.ardinal was
swept in all but one of the nine
matches.
I"he team was reassured bv
head coach Richard Elliot of the
importance of improving and get
ting match experience, regardless

of the results. I lie next morning
the Cardinal losi a squeaker to ( < >1-
gate .*>-1, squandering two-games
to-none advantages in two match
es.
Against Colgate, the team
proved wot tin of serious consider
ation in the eves of higher ranked
opponents. Stanford showed great
balance, winning the four lower
tanked matches. Sixth-ranked
Paul Valiant, No. 7 Rich Sher
wood, No. 8 Sam (.ellman and No.
9 Sagar Chandaria won matches
for the Cardinal. I hesc victories
were particular!) impressive be
cause all four of these plavers are
freshmen and defeated upper
classmen.
Latet that afternoon, the C Cardi
nal faced off against 1 lifts and lost
a tough game 7-2. Winning for
Stanford were Lek Arunanond
cliai and Ccllman, who went a
team best ,H-1 on the t tip.
Arunanondchai plaved a classic
match, beating his favored oppo
nent 3-1.
On Sundav morning, the Car
dinal traveled to Roc hester, w here
the team beat its higher ranked
opponent f»-I. Changing the
order of play, the team found a
line up against Rochestei that
compensated for the loss of their
No. I plaver, Wei. I'lic victorv as
sured the Cardinal a better na
tional ranking sometime in the
next two weeks.
hiking into consideration the
absence of Wei, the trip was a huge
success for the Cardinal. In
squash, the loss of a team's No. I
player not onh aliens that plavet 's
match, but it aliens all nine match
es because each plaver is moved up
one spot.
