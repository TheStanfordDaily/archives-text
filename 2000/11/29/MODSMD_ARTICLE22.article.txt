I In ft' weeks and twodavs to go until
I )-l )av lor Stanford men's basketball.
Hut belore the No. Cardinal actu
alK hoop it up with the No. I Duke Blue
I)evils on I)ee. 21, there's still plenty ol
basketball to be played. And there's no
shortage ol teams like ('(.-Riverside,
the opponent tonight at Maples Pavil
ion, to provide coach Mike Mont
gonicn .ind bis squad with ample op
portunity to prepare and experiment
before taking on head coach Mike
krzv/ewski in ()akland.
I ( -Riverside is in the midst ola
transition Iron) I)ivision 11 to Division I,
with the school playing this season as an
independent Division I team belore
joining the Big West for the 2000-2001
season. I nder coach |ohn M.isi, the
I liglilanders have been a force in Divi
sion II hoops during his 20 years atop
the program, including a third-place
finish in the 1989 Division II tourna
ment and.i plethora ol 20-win seasons.
Alter beating (ieorgia and Memphis
in Puerto Rico last week, the ('.artlinal is
in fora bit of a comedown against I C.-
Riverside â€” especially when you con
sider the I liglilanders don't start a play
er taller than 0-loot-N'.
" They're smaller, and they play a lot
of /one," redshirt sophomore center
|ason Collins said. "We know were
going to have to cut and move in spat e
a lot."
On the offensive end, I ('.-River

side's att.i< k options start and end
with sophomore forward Mark Miller,
who is the onl\ plavci on the team to
average double figures in storing at
14.3 points per game. The I ligli
landers onl\ shoot ,'W.N percent from
the field, and nearlv ball their shots
are
"[Miller's] an all-around srorcr," as
sistant coat li Trie Revcno said. "I le can
shoot from deep, but il von take that
awav he'll put it on the floor and take it
to the basket. I Its vcrv versatile.
One thing Millei won't have to
worn about is sophomore center Cur
tis Hort hartlt, who will sit out the game
with a broken toe on his lelt fotit. Ihe
shot-blot king Bon hartlt, who is also re
covering from a stress fracture in his
right loot from last season, may also
miss the game at I .oug Heat h State on
Saturdav, but his status for that trip will
be determined later in the week.
I hough losing Hort hartlt against
the Highlanders isn't much of a con
cern to the coaching stall, the Cardi
nal's weak i ( bounding against Oeorgia
last Saturdav in the Puerto Rico
Shootout championship game has
forced Montgomery and his stall to
locus on the hoards in practice.
"We've worked on blocking out and
getting to the boards." Revcno said.
"We haven't been beaten on the boards
too often.... It's something we take for
granted."
One the flip side, one unexpected
positive from San juan was the team's
level of fix us. which many detractors
have pointed to as a weak spot.
"Memphiscame at us v\ ill) a lot of in
tensity, and we matt lied them," Revcno
said. " They wanted to take it to us, and
we saitl 'Bring it on."'
I ipoff for the I (.-Riverside game is
at 7:30 p.m. at Maples Pavilion.
