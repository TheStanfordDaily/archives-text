Each year, as many as 2.5
million clinically depressed
Americans do not get reliel. de

drugs, visits to the therapist
and even shock treatments, ex

been collaborating with 20
leading medical institutions m a
150-patient trial ol the vagal
nerve stimulator. 1 his "pate
maker ol the brain" may be a
new treatment against severe
depression.
The new stimulator is a small,
battery-powered electrical de
vice, implanted below the collar
bone. It delivers intermittent
electrical signals cyclically to the
vagus nerve. These signals arc
then transmitted to the brain.
I hrough a poorly understood
process, the signals inhibit
