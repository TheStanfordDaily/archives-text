THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — I lie
Duieli parliament approved a bill yeslerda\ lo
allow euthanasia and physician-assisted suit ide,
which would make it the lirst country to for
mally legalize the prat lit e.
The bill passed by a vote ol 101-40. It still
needs the approval of the Senate, which is con
sidered a formality, and is expected to enter
into force next year.
Advocates say the law puts the Dutch in the
vanguard of patient rights, while opponents say
it will replace caring with killing.
"Doctors should not be treated as c riminals.
I his will create security for doctors and patients
alike," said Health Minister Els hoist, who
drafted the bill.
"Something as serious as ending ones life
deserves openness." she told I he Associated
Press after the vote.
I he bill adopts guidelines that parliament
approved in 100,'i, establishing the Nether
lands' semiofficial tolerance of euthanasia.
Under that policy it was understood that
doctors who followed the guidelines would

not be prosecuted, though euthanasia re
mained a c rime punishable In up to 12 years
in prison.
Under the guidelines, a patient must be un
dergoing irremediable and unbearable suller
ing, be aware of all other medical options and
have sought a second professional opinion. I lie
request musi be made voluntarily, persislenlh
and independently wbilethe patient is of sound
mind. 1 )oc tors are not supposed lo suggest it as
an option.
Pile new law also allows patients lo leave a
written request for euthanasia, giving doc tors
the right lo use their own disc retion when pa
tients become 100 phvsically or mcntallv ill to
de< ide for themselves.
No other country has attempted to legalize
euthanasia, health officials and legal experts
said, though it is tolerated in Switzerland,
Colombia and Belgium. Australia's Northern
Territorv approved euthanasia in September
109b, but the federal Parliament revoked the
law in Marc li 1997.
In ()regon, voters approved doc tor-assisted
suicide for the terminally ill in 1004. Since the
law took effect in 1007, 43 people have died in
()regon in assisted sui< ides.
The I louse of Representatives passed a bill
in October that would restrict the practice, but
President (llinton has threatened to veto the

bill.
Futhanasia remains illegal in the United
Slates.
In doctor-assisted suicides, the patient ad
ministers a lethal dose to him- or hersell.
I ndei the new Dutch law, a doctor can also do
so directly.
All 100 seats in the public gallery were lull lor
I uesday's vote — conducted In roll call on re
quest of a small (christian party opposed to the
measure.
I he date of the Senate vote has not yet been
set.
"It's a bad thing,' said [an Veldhui/cn, a
spectator in tlu- gallery who s;ii<l he supports
the ( In istian I )emo< ratic Alliance party.
Rita Marker, executive director ol the Inter
national Anti-Futhanasia I ask Force, said the
law will send a dangerous signal "telling people
that if it's legal, it's right."
"It will be like giving the household seal ol
approval. What is currently a dime will be
transformed into medical treatment." Marker
told I he Associated Press.
I )<>< tors honor about a one-third ol assisted
sui< ide requests in the Netherlands ea< h year,
according to government estimates. In 1000,
2,21 f> cases were recorded, but there also were
believed to be a larger number of unregistered
cases.
