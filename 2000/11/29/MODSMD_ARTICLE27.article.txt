# Gene-altered corn withheld from market
## Corn producer delays commercialization of biotech product until further review 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” A
major biotechnology company
says ii will restrict sales next year
of a type of gene-altered corn and
delay commercialization of an
other variety until 2002 to avoid
further disruptions in U.S. grain
exports.
I he moves announced Mon
day by ilk- Monsanto Co. are
meant to avoid repeating the
problems encountered this fall
when biotech corn developed bv
one of its competitors, Aventis
Crop Science, appeared in the
lood supply without being ap
proved for human consumption.
I S. corn sales to Japan and
other export markets have fallen
sharply this tall since the discovery
of the Aventis torn, known as Star
-1 .ink. in laco shells.
"We can't stop the develop
ment of this technology, but we are
going to use restraint," said Hen
drik Verlaillie, Monsanto's presi
dent and chief executive oflicer.
Federal officials have not con
firmed any illness relating to the
corn although they have received
nearly three do/en complaints
since reports about the Stat Link
corn first surfaced in September.
I he government is investigating
10 cases in whic Ii people reported
probable allergic reactions to
something they ate.
I lie Environmental Protection
Wenc \ was holdimr a nublic meet

ing'l uesda\ on a request by Aven
tis to approve Stat Link temporal i-
Iv for food use to avoid further
food rec alls.
Stai Link is the only genetically
engineered crop not approved for
human consumption. Federal reg
ulators say there is little if any
health risk from Star Link, al
though there are still unresolved
questions about its potential to
cause allergic reactions.
A variety of corn developed by
Monsanto to be resistant to the
company's popular Roundup
weedkiller will be distributed lor
sale- next year only to farmers in
areas where grain is seldom sold
for export, Verlaillie said. The
corn is approved for food use in
both the United States and Japan
but not in Europe. Traces of the
corn were found this fall in Bi itisli
niade tortilla chips.
The second Monsanto corn va
riety, which won't be put on the
market until 2002, is toxic to an in
sect pest, the corn rootworm. It is
yet to be approved in either Japan
or Europe.
fhe actions announced Mon
day don't ailed Monsanto's most
popular gene-altered crops, which
include Roundup-resistant soy
beans and cotton and a variety of
corn that is toxic to another pest,
the European corn borer.
A representative of the Nation
al Corn Growers Association,
which is especially concerned
about losing sales to Japan, praised
Monsanto's moves.
"We could not jeopardize our
biggest corn market by supporting
the commercialization" of a corn
