# Undergrad Senate addresses concerns
## ASSU discusses graduate student housing, female faculty tenure and student parents 
### BILL BOWEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford University is moving "as last as |it|
tan to alleviate graduate student housing
problems, according to Provost |ohn
Etchemendy ai last night's ASSU Undergrad
uate Senate meeting.
rhe University has laced increasing de
mands tor graduate housing as oil-campus
housing has become too expensive for many
graduates to afford in recent vears. The Uni
versity is planning to build two graduate apart
ment buildings in Kscondido Village.
Etchemendy is unsure if and when ihe pro
jects will be approved because ii is the first time
the University is trying to get building permits
under the new General Use Permit.
Representatives oft he graduate community
expressed discontent that student groups do
not have adequate meeting space due to in
creasing demands on space bv the registrar's
office and University discouragement of resi
dence halls as meeting places for student
groups.
In response to graduate needs, the Univer
sity is planning a new graduate community
center in Kscondido Village. The project is still
in the planning stage and will not be finished
tor another three to tour years.
The University also plans to construct new
child-care facilities and renovate existing labil
ities in response to overwhelmingly large de
mands for child care In undergraduate and
graduate married students.
Currently, the University provides child
care on a first-come, first-serve basis to faculty,
stall and students. However, the waiting list is
long .nid the services provided are grossly in
sufficient to meet child care demands.
The child care problem was discussed as
only one of many difficulties undergraduate
Stanford parents lace.
"The problem is undergraduate parents are

not being identified, and they don't have a list
of other undergraduate students,'' said Sena
tor ( In istallyn Mc('.loud, .1 sophomore. " I hey
don't know there is a support system tor
them."
Undergraduate parents often have finan
cial difficulties .is well, because they are un
aware of financial aid available to students with
children.
"We can do better in financial aids for these
students just by what we sav and how we say it,"
said University Vice Provost )amcs Montoya.
"There are a lot of resources available. We just
need to get the word out."
In order to help undergraduate families
with their financial concerns, the University
will present .1 financial aid workshop in the Ks
condido Village Cottage room on Dec. I at 1
p.m.
I lie I nivcrsity lias less definite plans to im
prove or renovate 1 residder Memorial Union
in response to concerns that it does not meet
students' needs.
"A new student union is an absolutely huge
project not onlv in terms of dollars but also of
square footage, and that's something we have
to be careful of with the new CUP,"
Etchemendy said.
University tenure policy was another big
issue at last night's meeting. Senators asked
what the University could do to have bcttci
representation of women and minorities
among tenured faculty.
Women and minority laculty members are
often disadvantaged in the tenure process be
cause the\ often spend much of their time
doing informal mentoring work that is not
considered 111 the tenure evaluation process,
according to Ktchemcndy.
Women and minority fatuity are in high
demand as mentors and, "if they're not care
ful, it can cut into research time." Etchemendy
said. " I liev cannot get a research portfolio to
gether since tliev are consumed by other
demands."
Senator Matt Brewer, a sophomore, wanted
to see how women and minority faculty could
have an easier time receiving tenure.
"Since one of the problems is that women
and minorit\ faculty spend time advising stu

dents, and minority students need mentor
ing, couldn't we make advising more of a pri
ority in the tenure evaluation process?" he
asked.
"()ne of the reasons we care so much about
research is that we care about teaching."
Klclicmendy responded. "One of the ways to
ensure good teac hers is to make sure they are
at the- forefront of their field of research. It
keeps them intellectually alive since they are
actively involved in their field."
I he University bases its affirmative action
program for faculty on the percentage of mi
norities available for hire in a particular field.
()ne ol the challenges to finding more women
and minority faculty is th<it the percentage ol
minorities in the pool of faculty candidates is
often much smaller than the percentage in the
general population.
(lurrently, the University encourages de
partments to hire women and minority profes
sors by granting extra funding to departments
which hire them.
Ktc hemendy also disc ussed how to make
students comply with copyright laws in re
sponse to a recent Washington Post article
showing that a large number of Stanford stu
dents copy software and music illegally.
"I question if people understand why copy
right laws are important." he said.
Ktchemendy commented on the inability ol
software producers to survive, much less im
prove their products, if not compensated lor
their contributions.
" I his is harmful to the whole society," he
said.
He also reminded Stanford students that
much of their future work will involve produc
tion of intellectual properly, and they have a
vested interest in protec ting it.
I'lie Stanford computer network is bur
dened with excessive trallic due largely to stu
dent Napster servers kept open lor downloads
from other people.
" 1 railic out ol the dorms is absolutely huge
.ind fills up between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m., Mon
toya s.iid. "No matter how much we open up
for traffic it always lills up. Kven if it's legal
musir exchanges, it's going to cost us an addi
tional $(>OO,OOO a year ji isi lor bandwidth."
