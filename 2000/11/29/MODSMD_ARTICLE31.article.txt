# Hopkins launches marine tagging effort

### WILL OREMUS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's 1 lopkins Marine Sta
tion recently hosted a meeting of
more than 60 marine scientists to
discuss a large-scale project that

would involve tagging and track
ing marine species from sharks to
squid. The project, dubbed T( JPP
or lagging of Pacific I'elagics, is
scheduled to commence in 2002.
I he project is just one compo
nent of the 10-vear, $1 billion C.en

sus of Marine 1 ,ile, a worldwide ef
fort to shed light on the dark
depths of the earth's oceans. Ma
rine biologists hope the project will
enable them to gain insight into
both the habits of the lagged crea
tures and certain characteristics of
their environment.
"The theory is to let the animals
show us what's going on in the
ocean realm," said Marine Biology
Prof. Barbara Block, the pro
gram's chair. "The data should
show us the migratory corridors,
the pastures, the meadows where
fish congregate, how the different
species interact with one another
and the hot spots of the ocean."
New technology has allowed
scientists to construct tags that are
smaller and have more memory
than older versions. Asa result, the
new tags will be able to monitor not
only location but also swimming
speed and water conditions such
as salinity and temperature.
Block and other Stanford re
searchers had previously tracked
bluefin tuna, gaining valuable in
formation about the fishes' migra
tory behavior despite using tags
that could only tell them where the
fish began and where they ended
up.
With the new technology, data
can be tracked and broadcast over
the Internet in real time. Project
planners expect this capacity to
open up exciting possibilities.

"A classroom could adopt an
elephant seal, and every morning,
students would tune in to find out
where the se.il lias gone," said
George Boehlert, director of the
U.S. Pacific Fisheries Environ
mental laboratory.
In addition to contributing to
general enlightenment about the
oceans and ocean life, the project
could yield data that would save
the lives of endangered marine an
imals. The study on bluefin tuna
gave governments the informa
tion they needed to properly regu
late fishing of the creature.
"I think the census is a tremen
dous chance for marine life t hat
are under enormous stress from
fishing, pollution, and potentially
from climate change," said (esse
Ausubel. Ausubcl is the program
director for the Allied P. Sloan
Foundation, one of the primary
contributors to the Census of Ma
rine Life.
The upcoming study is the first
to comprehensively track multiple
different species simultaneously,
making it possible to monitor in
teraction between different types
of creatures. Among those the sci
entists at the meeting decided to
track are albatrosses, salmon
sharks, leatherback turtles and
blue whales.
The scientists will reconvene for
a second workshop next year to fi
nalize plans.
