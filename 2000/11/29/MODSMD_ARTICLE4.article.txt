# Students react to grape decision
## University to make decision soon on whether to serve grapes in undergrad dining halls 
### JOSHUA HOWES 
The United Kami Worker's dec ision to tall oil
its Hi year-old grapes boycott last Wednesday hit
the Stanford campus like a predawn rain show
er — although a lew concerned students fell its
impact, most students never even knew it hap
pened.
" I had no idea the boycott was over," said senior
David Fleager, "And I have no idea why it ended."
While the majority of students remained un
aware, small groups of politically active students
reacted vociferously. Staff members ol the conser
vative Stanford Review hailed the boycott's end as

long overdue, while labor activists played up the
boycott's successes and looked to the Inline.
Sophomore Lolita Roibal, a co-chair ol the
Stanford Labor Action Coalition and supporter ol
the boycott, said ili.il while the I'FW's decision
caught her ofTguard, she continues to support the
union and hopes ilkii "the UFW can now move
forward with new ways to improve the impossible
living conditions ol latin workers."
"I'm glad tliiit the UFVV finally decided to end
the boycott," said junior Bob Mcdrew, editor of
I lie Review. "I only wish they'd done it earlier."
Meanwhile, administration officials plan to
bold meetings in the near future to rethink the
University's policy of allowing each residence to
decide whether or not it will boycott grapes, ac
cording to Asst. Dean of Students Tommy Woon.
The University must lirst decide whethei resi
dences that voted to boycott grapes this school
year will sti< k to those dec isions
now th.it the UFW has called of]
the boycott.
lint between McCrew's ardor
and Roibal's ambivalence, the
dominant mood on campus re
mains one of apathy. Main stu
dent s expressed contusion w hen
told about the boytott's end.
"I don't understand it," said
sophomore Mike I aubman.
"Just a couple weeks ago ii w.is .m
issue people took up with great
passion, and now it's just
stopped."
Many Stanford students said
they consider themselves rela
tively uninformed about the
grapes issue, but blame them
selves for iheir ignorant e.
" I here was information avail
able," laubman said, "but I
didn't look ai it, since the grape
boycott didn't seem to affect
me." Sophomore Man Saun

ders agreed: "A few students ob
viously realh tared about grapes
and tried to inform everyone
else, but most students just
didn't lake the time to listen."
1 hose who had supported the
boycott expressed far mote am
biguity in their reactions. Sopho
more (iabriela Rico seemed to
speak lot main in the activist
community when she ques
tioned whether there has been
enough improvement in the
working conditions of farm la
borers to warrant an end to the
box cot t.
but in the end, Rico saitl she
reluctantly supported the deci
sion, citing her "respect for the
intcgrit\ ol the I FYV as an orga
nization and a movement."
Jim Carlson, a Stanford Re
view stall member, saitl that it
was time lor the boycott to end,
citing the fact that "most ol the
objectives of the H)B4 boycott
have been met, including the
scheduled elimination of live
pesticides."
Carlson called for Stanford

students lo follow the l.'KW's
lead and stop supporting the
boycott.
" I he I I\\ is presumably bet
ter inlormed than the average
Stanford student," he said.
1 he I F\V claims it ended the
boycott because most of the boy
cott s objectives had been met
and other projects demanded
the union's undivided attention.
"It is not lair lo ask our sup
porters lo honor a boycott when
the union must devote all of its
present resources toward orga
nizing and negotiating con
tracts," UI W President Arturo
Rodriguez told the Los Angeles
limes.
With the grape boycott over,
former supporters like- Roibal
and Rico said they plan to sluli
their attention to other I l \\-
backed campaigns, like the new
boycott ol picksweet mushrooms
from Ventura (lounly.
Meanwhile, former grape
boycott opponents like \lc(irew
«ind Carlson said the) will main
lain their opposition to I I \\

boycott campaigns.
I Itimatcly. the two sides dis
agree 011 far more than grapes;
their views ol the entire market
economy appear to conflict.
(.arlson, lor example, said he be
lieves that "the free market has
the capacity to determine the ap
propriate conditions on these
farms," while Roibal argued that,
"it is this svstem that betrays
worket s even single day."
In fact, the onlv point on
whi< h all pat ties generally agree
is that the student body's over
whelming indifference is cause
loi concern, but nobodv seems
clear <»n how lo best address stu
dent apathy. Woon said he be
lieves the onlv ( lear c(inclusion is
that "we need a fresh approach
lo educating students about
|lood production|."
Woon said he plans lo address
this issue in upcoming meetings.
Regardless of student apathy,
Rico stressed one personal con
(lusion: "boycott or no boycott,
1 refuse lo cat the damn fruit
ever again."
