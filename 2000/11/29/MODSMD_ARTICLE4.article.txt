The United Kami Worker's dec ision to tall oil
its Hi year-old grapes boycott last Wednesday hit
the Stanford campus like a predawn rain show
er â€” although a lew concerned students fell its
impact, most students never even knew it hap
pened.
" I had no idea the boycott was over," said senior
David Fleager, "And I have no idea why it ended."
While the majority of students remained un
aware, small groups of politically active students
reacted vociferously. Staff members ol the conser
vative Stanford Review hailed the boycott's end as

long overdue, while labor activists played up the
boycott's successes and looked to the Inline.
Sophomore Lolita Roibal, a co-chair ol the
Stanford Labor Action Coalition and supporter ol
the boycott, said ili.il while the I'FW's decision
caught her ofTguard, she continues to support the
union and hopes ilkii "the UFW can now move
forward with new ways to improve the impossible
living conditions ol latin workers."
"I'm glad tliiit the UFVV finally decided to end
the boycott," said junior Bob Mcdrew, editor of
I lie Review. "I only wish they'd done it earlier."
Meanwhile, administration officials plan to
bold meetings in the near future to rethink the
University's policy of allowing each residence to
decide whether or not it will boycott grapes, ac
cording to Asst. Dean of Students Tommy Woon.
