"There has been a tremendous increase
in the mutilation ofbound library periodi
cals in the past six months, according to Dr.
G. A. Harrer, Assistant Library Director.
"1 larrer stated that the increase is almost
50 times what is normally found. 'Ofcourse,
there is some damage to be expected. Usu
ally I hear of one or two serious mutilations
a year, but I've received word of almost ;>0
within the past six months.'
"Magazines are usually bound for the li
brary in volumes comprising six months or
a year. I larrer said that students are cutting
entire articles running 8 to 12 pages out ol
the bound volumes, and they sometimes rip
the binding and remove an entire issue.
"Replacing such issues is time-consuming
and expensive. Harrer emphasized that if
the issues date back more than a lew years,
ii is olicii impossible to obtain replacements.
The missing pages must be photostated, at a
cost of $1 to $2 per page, reprinted and
then rebound, also an expensive process."
Bottom line: You know morals on campus have
reached an all-time low when students start rip
ping articles out of the periodicals at the library.
