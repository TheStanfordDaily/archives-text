CNN has formed an independent
advisory panel to evaluate its election
night procedures and use of the Voter
News Service against a background of
criticism of the TV networks.
It consists of Joan Konner, former
publisher of the Columbia Journalism
Review; James V Risser, professor
emeritus of communications at Stan
ford University; and Ben Wattenberg,
a senior fellow at the American Enter
prise Institute.
The panel will make recommenda
tions to Tom Johnson, chairman of the
CNN News Group.
All five major TV news divisions —
ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox News and
NBC — have said they will review their
use ofVNS data on election night when
they called Florida for Al Gore, then re
tracted that call, then for George W.
Bush and ultimately retracted that.
