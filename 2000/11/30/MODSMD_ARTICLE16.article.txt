## Bethlehem cancels Christmas 
### 
BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) —
Bethlehem's city lathers have called offam
bitious plans lor Christmas 2000, saying a
time of bloody Palestinian-Israeli conflict is
no time l<>r merrymaking.
The town of Jesus' birth will be dark and
deserted this Christmas — without festive
street lights, craft fairs and choirs in
Manger Square.
lu the }>;ist two months, seven Palestini
ans from the Bethlehem area have been
killed in rock-throwing clashes and gun
battles with Israeli soldiers.
For most of that time, Israeli travel re
strictions have kept tourists and other non-
Palestinians out ol biblical Bethlehem and
other Palestinian towns. I hese were tight
ened 10 days ago to bar all traffic into and
out of Palestinian towns.
"In view of the very bad situation we are
living in, it doesn't make sense that we cele
brate while there are still closures, and so
manv people have been killed,'' said Tony
Marcos, .1 spokesman lor the municipality.
"Celebrations lor Christmas have been
canceled, he said.
Festive street lights still hanging from
last year's celebrations, when thousands of
visitors crowded Manger Square, will re
main unlit. Musical concerts have been
called off and the Christmas craft lair will
not go ahead as planned.
1 here is even debate over whether the
giant Christmas tree, usually brought in
from Norway as the centerpiece of Manger
Square, will be decorated or left bare. ()ne
suggestion has been to hang pictures of
more than 200 Palestinians killed in light
ing on the branches of the C Ihristmas tree.
The travel restrictions have battered
Bethlehem's economy, which depends
heavilv on tourists.

"Manger Square by this time should
have been filled with tourists, guides and
visitors. Now it is empty," Marcos said.
Yesterday, only one shop lining Manger
Square was open. The other shopkeepers
were observing a strike call by the Palestini
an leadership — yesterday marked the an
niversary of the 1947 U.N. partition vote
that led to Israel's creation.
Joseph Jakaman stood in the doorway of
his souvenir shop, which sells religious icons
made from olive wood and mother of pearl.
"It's very bad, the people here are un
happy. The shops open fora few hours
every day, some don't even open any
more," he said, leaning against the counter,
a mother of pearl statue twinkling in the
light behind him.
Jakaman said he and his fellow Bethle
hem merchants had initially anticipated
record sales (his Christmas season, with large
numbers of tourists and pilgrims expected
for the 2000 th birthday of (Christianity.
"People were preparing for Christmas
from the beginning of this year. We
thought we would see the most tourists
ever," Jakaman said, adding that it had
been over a month and a half since a tourist
had bought something from his shop.
While the 1987-1993 Palestinian uprising
saw just a few hundred pilgrims brave heavy
security and safety concerns to celebrate
Christmas Eve in Bethlehem, thousands
have crowded Manger Square for C Christmas
festivities in the years since — until now.
Yesterday, the empty hallways of the
Church of the Nativity, built over the grot
to where tradition says Jesus was born,
echoed with the chanting of Orthodox
priests. I he grotto itself was occupied by a
lone priest, his head bowed, hands linger
ing rosary beads.
