TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) â€” Vice
President A1 (.ore authorized a new ap
peal to the Florida Supreme Court yes
terday, asking the justices who gave him
one of his most important legal victories
to force additional recounting of dis
puted votes.
With political and legal docks tick
ing, (lore's lawyers took steps to bypass
the state appeals court that would nor
mally hear the case before the seven jus
tices could intervene a second time.
"The issues in this appeal are of great
public importance because they directly
affect the outcome of the election of the

president of the United Slates and de
termine the sanctitv ol the electoral pro
cess in Florida law," the Gore team
wrote in a filing asking the appeals court
to step aside.
The request to the Supreme Gourt
came during a whirlwind d.iv of lcg.il
action spanning the state.
Democrats sought to speed up the
counting of votes essential to (iore's ef
fort to contest Florida's decision last
Sunday to declare George YV. Bush
the winner of the state's 25 electoral
votes.
Republicans maneuvered on several

fronts to slow the proc ess, knowing that
electors niusi lx* named to the Flee total
College l>\ Dec . 12.
Bnsh supporters claimed victon on
one front when Circuit Judge N.
Sanders Sauls in Tallahassee ap
proved the transfer of I million ballots
from Miami-Dade and Palm Heath
counties to Tallahassee fora Saturday
hearing.
I he judge gave the counties until ">
p.m. Friday to complete the transfer,
rejecting Gore's request to have the dis
puted ballots that the vice president
wants recounted shipped earlier to save
time.
Behind closed doors in Washington,
bot.li sides' lawvers worked to prepare
for arguments Friday before the U.S.
Supreme Court.
After hours of debate by advisers
Tuesday night and yesterdax. (lore au
thorized an appeal to the Florida
Supreme Court that would ask the jus
tices to order the immediate recounting
of disputed ballots in Palm Beach and
Miami-Dade counties that weren't in
dueled in the state's official t;ill\ certi
fied on Sunday.
Democratic: officials said the appeal
would ask the high court to either su
pervise and direct the counting of bal
lots itself or order Sauls to begin doing
so immediately.
Sauls on Tuesday lucl refused to
hear Gore's recounting request on an
expedited basis. Instead, lie ordered a
hearing for Saturday and the transfer of
the ballots.
