## SUMMARY JUDGMENT Bush presidency would threaten air quality 
### 
It's likel\ tHat Texas Governor
(ieorge W. Bush will be the next
president. Many people worry
that his future Supreme Court
appointees will threaten legalized
abortions. W hat is more likely is that
Bush's appointees will threaten
clean-ail standards and environment
protection laws.
Liberals fret about a Supreme
Court filled with Justice Antonin
Scalia and Scalia-clones like Justice
Clarence Thomas, both of whom
view dimly a woman's right to an
abortion. The Court is currently pre
cariously balanced, so that a few anti
abortion appointees could overturn
Roe vs. Wade.
However, due to Bush's lack of po
litical capital resulting from losing
the popular vote, it is unlikely that he
will be able to appoint enough anti
abortion justices to overturn 25 years
of precedent.
But enforcement of the Clean Air
Act is at risk. It is unlikely that Bush
would be able to get a judge as con-

servative as Scalia
confirmed in a divid
ed Senate, but lie will
probably pick judges
who at least disagree
with the Environ
mental Protection
Agency's enforce
ment of clean-air
standards.

A case recently heard by the
Supreme Court — coincidentally on
Election Day — shows how a few
more moderately conservative jus
tices would prevent effective enforce
ment of EPA regulations.
American Trucking Associations
vs. Browner and a companion law
suit were brought against the EPA
when it tightened clean air stan
dards in 1997 (Browner is the EPA
administrator). The new ozone stan
dard is .08 parts per million over an
eight-hour period, as opposed to the
former .12 parts per million stan
dard. Also, the allowable si/e for soot
pollution dropped from 10 microns

to 2.5 microns — 20 times thinner
than a human hair.
The EPA revised the existing
clean-air standards alter numer
ous studies proved stricter limits
were necessary to better protect
public health. According to
Howard Fox, a lawyer represent
ing the American Lung Associa
tion, the new standards "will pie
vent thousands of premature
deaths a year, tens of thousands of
hospitalizations, and millions of
missed days of school."
I lowever, industry representatives
argue tli.it complving with these new
standards will cost U.S. businesses
$00 billion a year by requiring them
to buy clean coal and new equip
ment. They argue that the EPA was
wrong to impose the new standards
without taking costs into account.
Ihe lawsuits argued before the
Supreme Court last Nov. 7th raised
two issues. First, tliev raised the issue
of whether it is unconstitutional for
Congress to give the EPA—part of

the executive branch — such sweep
ing regulatory power over air quality,
since this may violate the separation
of powers doctrine. Second, they
raised the issue of whether the EPA
has to consider the industry's cost of
compliance when coming up with
standards.
In May 1999, the D.C. Court of
Appeals ruled 2-1 in favor of the in
dustry's argument that regulating air
pollution is Congress' job, not the
EPA's, and that the new air quality
standards were arbitrary.
While it is uncertain how the
Supreme Court will eventually rule
on this case, there is some evidence
that the more conservative justices
will favor the industry's view. For ex
ample, at the hearing Scalia won
dered out loud why 2.5 microns was
an acceptable standard rather than
an arbitrary one.
This is where Bush's future ap
pointees will come in. Even with only
moderately conservative appointees —
the only ones Bush will be able to get by

the divided Senate — a future Supreme
(loin t will likely limit the EPA's power to
enforce the Clean Air Act and other en
vironmental regulations.
If such a court were to take the ex
treme position suggested by tlie I).C.
court — that Congress must specify
air quality standards, not the EPA —
then our breathing air would be at
the mercy of a legislature littered
with checks from polluting indus
tries.
Should you doubt that Bush
would appoint justices unsympathet
ic to clean air, you need only look at
1) Bush's background in the oil in
dustry, 2) his proposals for drilling
for oil in environmentally sensitive
areas and 3) his environmental track
record in Texas.
Bush's apparent victory may not
have much effect on abortion rights,
but it will affect our abilitv to breathe.
