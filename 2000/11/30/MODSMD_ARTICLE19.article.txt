# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Anti-globalization protests misguided 
### MATT BENTLEY GUEST COLUMNIST 
This week marks I he one-year an
niversary <>l the infamous
World Trade Organization
Summit in Seattle that attracted
international attention when tens of thou
sands <>1 demonstrators clashed with
overzealous and underprepared riot po
lite. Ihe ensuing "Battle in Seattle"
marked the birth of anti-globali/ation as
the hot activist issue of the moment.
1 "hough it experienced immense pop
ularity the anti-globali/ation movement
never really had a coherent identity of its
own. It exists as an uneasy alliance be
tween activists of all flavors: environmen
talists. pro-union labor, anti-corporate
power Naderit.es, human rights activists
<ind numerous others.
These groups shed the complexities of
their individual issues to seek shelter
under the umbrella of anti-globali/ation.
Suddenly, the media had something sim
ple it could really sink its teeth into, and
Joe (College had a good reason to "just go
out and rage, dude" without needing to
understand any underlying policy issues.
Unlike the '60s leviathans of the Viet
nam War or the civil lights movement,
globalization is more comparable to the
Nothing in the fantasy novel "The Never
ending Story:" We never see the Nothing,
only the swaths of destruction it leaves in
its wake.
Even eight-year-olds can immediately
connect the desecration of Fantasia and
the sudden lack of living dragon-dogs
with the passing of the Nothing's dark
cloud.
But does this adolescent logic transfer
to reality? Even with the real world's
added complications, many people try to
blame any and all woes (right up to the dis
appearance of Hying dragon-dogs) on the
most immediate and visible villain. Today,
that villain is globalization.
While it's nice to see some stirrings of
life in an otherwise politically apathetic
generation (listening to Rage Against the
Machine or writing your CIV paper on
Marx does not count as activism), simply
fighting against "globalization" ignores
the complexities of the real challenges
fac ing us.
The equivalent 'M) years ago would
have been declaring yourself an anti-
Cold War protester. Good or bad, the
Cold War defined the era, but the issues

ol the Vietnam War, nuclear armament
and civil rights were the points of con
tention.
I'd like to see a recasting of the plav
ers in the globalization debate. Ease up
on the demoni/ation of the WTO, the
International Monetarv Fund and the
World Bank. I rust me, I lived right
down the street from WTO headquar
ters in Geneva. I wined and dined
among their ranks, and there were no
corporate master puppeteers, no fat
cats intent on plundering developing
countries.
The people working at the WTO,
IMF and World Bank are just like von
and me: They want to create a better
world. Their doctorates and years ol hu
manitarian work tell them that facilitat
ing free trade among nations is the best
way to clo it. I, for one, don't feel I have
the education and experience to advise
them otherwise.
Many leading ac tivist groups are realiz
ing that working with these organizations
can be more effective than hurling bricks
at them. At recent Prague meetings, the
World Bank and IMF allowed non-gov
ernmental organizations and pressure
groups to oflicially voice their opinions as
part of the talks, rather than just outside in
the streets.
And the titans of globalization just
might be listening. Hoi st Kohler, manag
ing director of the IMF, lias at least begun
to parrot the activists' rhetoric: "We have
to tackle the selfishness of wealthy coun
tries," he said at the conference. "This is a
question of morals."
If progress has been made, it's due to
the work of the NGOs and pressure
groups who have correctly separated the
real issues from the media rhetoric.
They're fighting for third world debt re
lief, environmental preservation and
human rights by guiding, rather than
fruitlessly trying to obstruct, the flow of
globalization.
So the next time you're cruising Uni
versity Avenue waving a lit Molotov cock
tail in your hand, consider your targeting
carefully.
You don't want to waste time lighting
imaginary battles against the Nothing
when there are so many real causes out
there worthy of your attention.
