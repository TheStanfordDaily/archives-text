It's time to enjoy grapes
Like a vengeful spirit from beyond I he
grave, tlie now-deceased grapes boycott
continues to haunt our fait campus. It bai
lies me why ibis is even still an issue. Not
only has support lor this cause been dwin
dling in the past lew \cars (the Stanford
Review < itcs the number of dining halls re
fusing to serve grapes down to a mere \V2
percent), but also the United Farm Work
ers have voluntarily ended the boycott!
1 be majority ol the demands that origi
ually started the boycott have been met or
are on their way to doing so.
As il this weren't enough, this year's
voting has been marked with a spirit of ap
athy that is not conducive to such a politi
cally c harged issue. Granted, a few pam
phlets were passed out, but I would wager
that the vast majority of the student popu
lace was only vaguely aware that a vote was
taking place. Recent Daily coverage of the
issue is probably the only reason most peo
ple know about il. If no one seems to care
about il any more, why do we even bother
to have a vote at all?
The only reason we even have the
grapes vote is because of a hunger strike of
a few students back in 1994 that lead to the
University taking notice. Despite what we
may think after the recent election, we do
still live in a democracy. The noble efforts
ol an extremely vocal minority should not
overshadow the wants of the entire cam
pus. But none of that even matters. The
impetus behind this whole fiasco has dis

appeared.
The UFYV, seeing victory around it and
on the hori/on, has called an end to the
boycott. With the workers now returning
to their jobs, they obviously want a de
mand lor their product so they can con
tinue working. If Stanford refuses to buy
grapes, doesn't it seem like we are ac ting in
contradiction toour original purpose? We
set out to help the I l\V, but now that our
original objective has been, met we are
moving in the opposite direction. Stan
lord is in essence refusing 10 support the
UFW by not buying the grapes it now
wauls to sell.
Now, I don't think it takes a genius to
see what the next logical step is: End the
voting and bring back the grapes. We get
some good grapes out here and it would
be a shame to be deprived of them just be
cause a few committed individuals can't
see when they've already won. Therelore,
I urge the University and all those still in
support of the boycott to reali/e that
zealotry will lose more supporters than it
gains and to finally bring back the grapes.
I'm tired of eating raisins and wistfully re
membering the delicious taste of their sue -
culent grape brethren.

Important legal actions against farmers
Thank you for running the brief wire
story reporting that environmental

groups are challenging ihe stale clean
water law loophole lor pesticide-laden ir
rigation return waters ("Environmental
ists ask state to stop pesticide runolF,"
Nov. 29).
While the story implies that environ
mentalists are seeking to prevent all agri
cultural runoff. the groups are only ask
ing that pesticide-laden discharges be
subject to the same regulation under
state water law as other sources. It is only
reasonable that the waiver of waste dis
charge reporting requirements for Cen
tral Valley farmers be terminated now
that scientific data show pesticide ninolf
from farms is seriously harming fish and
wildlife and is threatening drinking
water supplies.
I he story also did not mention that
lhe petition asking the Central Valley
Regional Water Quality Control Board
to terminate the waiver was prepared
and written by Stanford Law School stu
dents working with attorneys at the
Earthjustice Environmental Law Clinic
at Stanford.
Ihe environmental clinic gives stu
dents the opportunity to gain real-world
experience by providing legal assistance to
nonprofit organizations such as San Fran
cisco Bay Keeper and Delta Keeper, on
whose behalf the petition was filed. Stu
dents who have worked on ibis case hope
I he Daily continues to cover this impor
