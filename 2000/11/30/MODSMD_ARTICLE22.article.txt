### MARK BOUCHER EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford Teacher Education Pro
gram might supply student teachers lor a
new charter high school in East Palo Alto
sponsored by the Bill X: Melinda Gates
Foundation.
According to Charla Rolland, director of
professional enhancement in tlu- School of
Education, the program is currently talking
with the foundation, the Ravenswood
School District and Aspire Public Schools, a
non-profit organization that helps create
charter schools.
"We are exploring how and if Stanford
might be a partner in that new school," she
said.
STEP trains teachers through classes in
the School of Education and through expe
rience in public school classrooms. Under
the proposed arrangement, the program's
students would assist certified teachers m the
charter school's classes.
"It is our plan and hope that we will be
able to have ... student teachers teach for
half the day and observe for half the day,"
said Rolland.
The school could open as early as fall
2001 with up to 75 ninth graders. A class this
size would allow as many as 5 or (> teachers
from Stanford to work at the school. The
school would add more grades in future
years.
The new school has also enlisted t lie ser
vices of Education Prof. Linda Darling-
Hammond. a national expert in the field of
high school design. Darling-Hammond will
develop the school to provide a superior en
vironment for teaching and learning. She
will also design the school's curriculum.

According to Rolland, Aspire and the
school district approached SI EP and Dar
ling-Hammond about helping with the
charter school. Darling-Hammond has
helped to design other high schools.
