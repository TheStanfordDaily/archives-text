## Volleyball poised for tourney time 
### EZRA CALLAHAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
So maybe the regular season
didn't go exactly as planned for
the Stanford women's volleyball
team.
A No. IS national ranking, an
18-1 1 final regular season record
and a fourth-place finish in the Pa
cific 10 Conference isn't exactly
what the team imagined for itsell
back in September.
Good thing none of that mat
ters now.
Tonight the battle for the na
tional championship gets under
way as the 2000 NCAA. Tourna
ment kicks off around ihecountrv,
and the Stanford squad is reach to
make a run at the very title it won
four times in the- past decade.
l he Cardinal opens play
tonight with a first-round match
against No. 22 Loyola Marymoum
(20-8) at theThunderdome on the
campus of U( 1-Santa Barbara.
I he winner of this match faces
the winner of tonight's match be
tween No. 14 UCSB (23-7) and the
University of Texas-San Antonio
(24-8) in the second round tomor
row night.
Opponents may have written
off the Cardinal from national con
tention during the course of its
somelimes-tumultuous season,
but the tournament provides the
team's members an opportunity to
prove the pundits wrong and show
what they've believed all along:
that they are a serious contender
for the national title.
"I think we all feel like we really
have a shot at this," said junior out
side hitter Sara Sandrik.
"We're starting with a clean
slate, and everyone knows that we
play well in the postseason."
Alter bottoming out during the
program's first ever four-game los
ing streak in late September, Stan
lord has gained consistency in its
play during the second half of the
season, and even looks to be peak
ing just as the tournament gets
underway.
Stanford closed out the regular
season with four straight victories,

including an impressive 3-1 win
over then-No. 14 Santa Clara in
the ('.animal's last match.
The Cardinal's strong play at
the finish of the season had the
team hoping to land home-court
advantage in the lirst two rounds
of the tournament.
However, the tournament's se
lection committee dashed those
hopes when they released the
brackets op Sunday.
"It was initially disappointing
that we didn't get picked to host
the lirst rounds,'' said senior setter
Lindsay Kagawa, the team's
captain. "But we got a pretlv good
draw and I'll gladh trade home
court for that.'
Stanford's draw has it facing
I.ML in the first round. 1 he Lions
finished third in the West Coast
Conference behind Santa Clara
and No. 15 Pepperdine.
LMU boasts the nation's lead
ing attacker in senior outside hit
ter Sarah McFarland. McFarland
leads the nation in kills on the sea
son with 751, averaging an NCAA
record 7.91 kills per game.
"You gotta be aware of a kid
who's ()-7 and hits over a thousand
balls more than the rest ol her
teammates," interim head coach
Denise Corlett said about
Mc Farland. "The main goal is to
make sure that no one else on their
team has a good night. If we hold
the rest of the team clown, there's
only so much |Mc Farland | can
do."
Corlett pointed to LMU's
penultimate regular season game
two weeks ago against Santa ( lava
as an example. In that contest, Mc -
Farland picked up 39 kills, but the
Lions still fell somewhat decisive!)
to the Broncos 3-1.
Meanwhile, things on the Car
dinal's side ol the court seem to fi
nally be falling into place.
With senior middle blocker
Jennifer Detmer still getting back
into the swing of things after miss
ing several games lor health rea
sons, junior Tara Conrad contin
ues to play well in her place.

Sophomore Ashley Ivy looms over an imminent kill in a Nov. 17 match at
home against Oregon State. Ivy and the 18th-ranked Cardinal begin post
season play tonight against the No. 22 Loyola Marymount Lions in Santa
Barbara's Thunderdome at 5:30 p.m.
Conrad, who moved from out
side hitter to the middle late in the
season, is second on the team in
kills and has posted double-digit
kills in Stanford's hist three mate li
es. Stan lord lias also gotten solid
performances from its bench of
late.
Outside hitters Sandrik and
freshman Sara Dukes combined
for IS kills olf the bench against
Santa (llara, and freshman middle
blocker Jenn Harvey lias come in
(luring several matches to provide
solid blocking for the Cardinal.
Nerves might be a bit of a con
cern for Stanford, as the team
boasts five freshmen who will be
playing in their first NCAA tour
nament game.
"We've all seen Stanford on TV
in the tournament before and it's
one of the reasons we were all
drawn here," said Dukes. "We
wanted to be a part of that."
Corlett is confident that the
freshmen, however inexperi
enced, will be ready to play.
"I think they were a little taken
aback when we showed them the
tentative schedule for what hap
pens if we make it all the way and
we're only 011 campus four days in
the next three weeks," Corlett
said.
"But 1 think they're dealing
with it well, and they won't have
an) problems."
