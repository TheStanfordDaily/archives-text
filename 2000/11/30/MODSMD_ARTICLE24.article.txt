# Big win over Riverside marred by miscues and sloppy action
## 
### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
By the lime the final score
weni up last night at Maples
Pavilion, there was a palpable
sense of relief in the air from the
remnants ol the half-capacit\
crowd.
Not because the Stanford
men's basketball team tame dose
to losing. Far from it.
No, the No. .'i C '.animal's 84-41
win over I ('.-Riverside was an ex
ercise in ugly basketball, replete
with 40 turnovers, personal
fouls and plentv of bad shots to go
around.
l he Highlanders, who are
playing their first season in Divi
sion I. came in starting a 0-foot-8
center and were forced to bomb
awav from the outside without
much success.
"It was a tough situation for
Riverside," Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery said. "We're
awfully big, but I do think River
side plavs good basketball in
terms of style of play, but it was
just tough lor them to get a shot
off."
Redshirt sophomore center
|ason ( ollins was the primary ob
stacle for the 1 lighlanders in that
respect, controlling the post with
his 7-foot body and long arms
and preventing any Highlanders
from getting decent looks at the
hoop inside.
UC'.-Riverside shot ;U.. r > per
cent from the field for the game,
including a woeful f>-lor-2f> night
from behind the three-point arc.
T he team's best player, sopho
more Mark Miller, scored onl\
five points on 2-for-12 shooting,
nine less than his season average.
Jason Collins, meanwhile,
dominated the smaller High
landers on the offensive end, reg
istering a career-high 1 ( .) points to

go with 1 1 rebounds.
"It's just been an injurv thing
with [Jason]," said Montgomery,
who didn't pia\ his first two years
on the Farm due to knee and
wrist injuries.
"I think lie's very comfortable
in the starting role and having his
brother (Jarron) play together
with him," Montgomery said.
"We need him tobedominant,
we need to make people have to
defend him. lie's .t big lioss in
there. 1 think lie's in better shape,
<ind he lias a Near under his belt
from last year."
Jarron contributed 12 points
and 12 rebounds of his own, with
little help off the bench.
Sophomore center (luriis Bor
cliardt missed the game with a
chipped bone in his left pink\ toe,
and his return lor Saturday's
game at Long lieacli State is in
doubt.
lhe rest of the players,
though, are getting ants\ about
the looming mate hup with No. I
Duke on Dec. 21. Sophomore
guard (lasey Jacobsen, lor one, is
ready to take on a team of Stan
ford's caliber.
"Vou don't want to have these
kind of games be dose, but I
sometimes do wish that we could
gel some experience plaving in
tight situations — where you have
to plav with heart." |acobsen said.
"We've got to beat the teams
we're plaving against — we're not
in charge of scheduling teams."
Long Beach State should
prove to be more ola c hallenge
for Jacobsen and his teammates.
1 he Ders are a perennial power
in lhe Big West (which L( '.-River
side will join next vear), and near
ly made the NC.AA Tournament
as an at-largc team. Montgomery,
who graduated from Long Beach
State in 1908, is hoping to get
Borchardt back on the floor, if

only to make sure lhe f'Jers don t
pull oil the upset.
"We just need to gel healthy
and get our whole basketball
team together," Montgomery

said.
"We were a little sloppy. Wc
shouldn't have had 10 turnovers
but Riverside is scrappy. The)
played until the end."
