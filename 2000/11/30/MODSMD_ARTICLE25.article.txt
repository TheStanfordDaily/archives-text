Senior diver Kim Powers does not make
excuses.
When she felt some pain in her shoulder last
spring, Powers brushed oil the sensation as
mere tendonitis and continued to dive, trying to
perlect her spins and somersaults to earn a spot
on the United States ()lympic team.
Iler shoulder "kept getting worse and
worse," said Powers, the 1909 Pacific MKlonler
ence (10-Diver of the Year.
"lint I couldn't just sav 'my shoulder hurt.'
Showing the grit and determination ili.it
makes her such a fierce competitor, Powers
fought through the pain and competed on the
springboard and the 10-meter platform in the
2000 ()lympic Trials at Seattle.
Never mind th.it she could barely move her
shoulder afterward.
Powers failed to quality lor the (Mympic team
by not finishing in the top two in either the lO
meter platform or springboard events at the tri
als, despite what head diving coach Rick
Schavone called an "impressive" performance.

"Kim was verv u )inpel itive at I rials, given her
situation," Schavone said.
"She battled various injuries throughout the
whole year."
Alter failing to make the ()lympic team. Pow
ers was.it <i crossroads: Should she continue
diving?
"1 leel ili.it I didn't have the best trial that I
could have had," Powers said.
"It is kind of hard to slop diving when you
didn't reach your potential or end on a good
note."
Not wanting to end her dreams of being an
Olvmpian, Powers decided to have shoulder
surgery last month.
I o heal the most serious injury of Powers's
career, surgeons tightened her rotator cull
muscle and cut oil a piece of her clavicle bone.
I hough Powers had initially planned on fin
ishing her diving career this season, she made a
commitment to continue her journey that may
lead her to the 200 1 ()l\ mpics.
"I had the operation so I could dive lor four
more years," Powers said.
By red-shirting this yeai. Powers mav be giv
ing herself a preview of what life after diving

ma\ be like, though having extra free time feels
strange.
"This is definitely the longest I have been out
of diving," Powers said.
"It is a life adjustment and I sometimes don't
really know what to do with myself diving has
been such a huge part of my life."
Powers first started diving when she was nine
years old after she had joined a swimming and
diving team near her hometown in northern
Kentucky.
As Powers honed her diving skills, she
teamed up with renowned diving coach (lharlie
C.asuto in Cincinnati and developed her versa
tile craft on both the three-meter springboard
and the 10-meter platform events, two events
that are on opposite ends of the diving
spectrum.
"I think it takes two totally different people to
dive tower (10-meter platform) and spring
board. Powers said.
She has successfully combined the precision
and agility associated with the the springboard
with the tumbling and extreme nature of a gym-
nasi while jumping off of the 10-meter
concrete I)1<k k to win numerous meets in
both events.
Schavone said Powers had gained
recognition with her phenomenal diving
abilities even before she got to Stanford,
w here she has flourished.
According to Schavone, Powers is a
fundamentally sound diver with excel
lent technique.
"Kim has amazing talent and is very
skilled," Schavone said.
"She is very graceful and very clean in
getting into the water. She has great
motoi movement."
Combine her technical ability and a
calm demeanor that often masks her ner
vousness, and it is easy to realize why
Powers has achieved so many accolades in
diving.
As a freshman, Powers jumped onto
the college diving scene by winning the
platform competition at both the Pac-10
championships and the All-America
championships.
Powers consistently places in the top
six in national diving competitions in
both the springboard and platform
events.
En route to being named Pac-10 Co-
Diver of the Year her sophomore season,
Powers surpassed the Pac-10 record for
number ol meets in the platform compe
tition when she finished second to team
in,tie Erin Sones.
( onsider these meets, as Powers does,
tune-ups for the (Mympics.

"The Olympics have been the major
goal for me because, in diving, that is the
biggest meet," Powers said.
Schavone believes Powers will be one
of the top 16 divers in the nation th.u will
be invited to the U.S. Olympic Trials in
2004.
Schavone believes ihat when it gets
down to the remaining eight divers, "it
will be like a horserace, because anything
can happen in diving."
When she is looking down into the
water from 10 meters above or hopping
on the three-meter springboard. Powers
will feel pressure — but it probably will

not phase the calm and determined
diver.
"I like competing and being under a
lot of pressure," Powers said.
"1 think that is where I do my best."
In the meantime, Powers plans on re
covering one year at a time.
"I want to have a great last collegiate
season and do well at NCAAs next year,"
Powers said. "We'll see where the next
three years take me."
Perhaps Powers will end up in a land
that she has always wanted to visit —
Athens, Greece lor the 2004 Summer
()lympic Games.

"She is very graceful and very clean in
getting into the water. She has great
motoi movement."
Combine her technical ability and a
calm demeanor that often masks her ner
vousness, and it is easy to realize why
Powers has achieved so many accolades in
diving.
As a freshman, Powers jumped onto
the college diving scene by winning the
platform competition at both the Pac-10
championships and the All-America
championships.
Powers consistently places in the top
six in national diving competitions in
both the springboard and platform
events.
En route to being named Pac-10 Co-
Diver of the Year her sophomore season,
Powers surpassed the Pac-10 record for
number ol meets in the platform compe
tition when she finished second to team
in,tie Erin Sones.
( onsider these meets, as Powers does,
tune-ups for the (Mympics.

"The Olympics have been the major
goal for me because, in diving, that is the
biggest meet," Powers said.
Schavone believes Powers will be one
of the top 16 divers in the nation th.u will
be invited to the U.S. Olympic Trials in
2004.
Schavone believes ihat when it gets
down to the remaining eight divers, "it
will be like a horserace, because anything
can happen in diving."
When she is looking down into the
water from 10 meters above or hopping
on the three-meter springboard. Powers
will feel pressure — but it probably will

not phase the calm and determined
diver.
"I like competing and being under a
lot of pressure," Powers said.
"1 think that is where I do my best."
In the meantime, Powers plans on re
covering one year at a time.
"I want to have a great last collegiate
season and do well at NCAAs next year,"
Powers said. "We'll see where the next
three years take me."
Perhaps Powers will end up in a land
that she has always wanted to visit —
Athens, Greece lor the 2004 Summer
()lympic Games.
