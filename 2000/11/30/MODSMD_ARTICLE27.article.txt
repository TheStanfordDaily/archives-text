# UNDERGRADUATE FAMILIES
## Drawing the Line Between Family and Studies 
### EMILY YATES-DOERR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the toy-strewn room of transfer student Re
becca Trotzky-Sirr's Escondido Village apart
ment, a group of undergraduate parents gath
ered a few days ago to discuss the recent state
ment issued by the Work-Life Office in regard to
campus childcare.
1 lie group felt that this statement not only failed
to address any of their problems, but also failed to
acknowledge their existence. This network of par
ents is also pressed for time, as today Provost John
Etchemendy is expected to make a statement about
the University's position on childcare.
The apartment is filled with children and their
undergraduate parents who have been meeting on
and of 112 lor the last two years.
These meetings, they say, are a time lor them to
gain strength from other people with similar prob
lems and triumphs. It is a time lor them to socialize
and for their children to play together. And it is a
time for these unique parents — most ol them ex
traordinary students as well — to organize so that
over the noise of children, bureaucracy and financial
constraints, their voices can still be heard.
Personal struggles
This lack of recognition was more disappointing
to the undergraduate parents than it was surprising.
"In general, Stanford caters to the traditional stu
dent and figures that the student body lias verv ho
mogenous needs," said senior Chrichelle McC loud.
McCloud began at Stanford as a typical lreshman in
the lall of 1993. In the middle of her junior vear she
decided to take a year off. That year eventualh be
came four years, and when she returned, she came
with Erielle, her 2-year-old daughter.
"Many people would probably be surprised to
know that there are any students with children
here," she said.
Kathleen Sullivan, director of the Work-Life Of
fice, said however that the Universitv is aware of the
plight of undergraduate parents.
"There is a great deal to be done and mam issues
to address," she said. "We look forward to continu
ing to work with the undergraduate parents in sup
porting them during their studies at Stanford."
But many members of the group are frustrated
with the responses that they have been given. Said
McCloud, "They have organized groups to help' us.
but those we've met with claim to have no power to
actually help us. so little has been done. All that
we've gotten from the people we've met are refresh
ments and excuses why they can't change anything
to really help us."
One of the group's main concerns is that there
are other undergraduate parents at Stanford who
feel alone in their struggle to balance classwork and
parenting. These potential group members ma\
have simply not heard that there are other patents
out there, or a group of parents that meet regularly.
Senior Aniorita Valdez began her freshman \ ear
at Stanford in 1996 while in her third trimester ol
pregnancy with daughter Alma, who is now nearh
4. After the first quarter she stopped out for two
and-a-half years.
"When I left after my first quarter I knew as
many people as when I got here," she said. "I lived
in EV but I didn't have the benefit of many re
sources for institutional or social orientation that
traditional students benefit from. I thought that 1
was surely the only undergraduate with or expect
ing a child, and there was no branch of the univer
sity that could tell me otherwise.
"It was incredibly isolating. While I was reallv ex
cited to come here, I didn't feel like I was in a safe
place, and it felt overwhelming. I'm luck\ because 1
have wonderful family support, but being around
others with similar experiences and concerns lias
really helped," she added.
Identifying fellow parents is just one of the prob
lems group members face. In the academic world
where papers, exams and problems sets are gener
ally the paramount concerns of students, one of the
top issues of this group is childcare.
1 here is generally a two-year waiting list for cam
pus daycare and even then the cost is often bevond
a student's budget.
Senior Bernie Garcia said, "We keep running up
against inflexible systems. People say that 'we can't
make an exception for one person,' even il this one
person is struggling to maintain family and cours
es."
"The only thing that I approached the Universi
ty with was my need for childcare," sophomore Lisa
Prieto said. Rather than put her son on the "ridicu
lously long waiting list" for Bing Nursery School,
she hoped that she would be able to find something
more affordable once she and her husband arrived
at Stanford.
After days spent looking for childcare, she now
admits, "Boy, was I ever wrong."
Instead, Preito's husband had to rearrange his
schedule to take care of their son during the day
while she is in class. When Prieto gets home from
school, her husband goes to work until late into the
night.
She said that this schedule "has proved difficult.
Studying doesn't take place until after my husband
gets out of work, which is usually around 10 or 11.
It also means late nights reading and no shuteyc vir
tually every night."
Childcare hard to find
Considering the high demand for childcare in
the Bay Area and the popularity of Stanford's facil
ities—Bing has a two year waiting list— some stu

deiiis have had to turn to daycare in other cotnmu
niies.
1 he < omniuic to these places, sometimes via pub
lit transportation, can lake hours that could poten
lialh be used for siu< 1\ .md work. Prieto said that she
was hit k\ to find am place at all. "I was not ready for
how hard it would be, waking up two hours bclbre
m\ firsi (l.iss to get m\ son readx and take him to
daycare oil campus."

As her eighteen-month-old son Zev plays with her computer, senior Rebecca Trotzky-Sirr talks about the economic pressure she faces as an undergraduate parent. "It's so iron
ic to sit through my economic classes that talk about how horrible welfare is. I had one of my TA's over to dinner last year and was thinking the whole time, guess what bought
that food?" she said.


EMILY YATES-DOERR/The Stanford Daily
'They used to have their own rooms," said senior Bernie Garcia when talking about his sons Bernie Jr. and John. "But
I wasn't getting any work done and had my papers spread all over the living room. Now they share a room and I
have an office."
I Humilities lor its student body and day
care should be included among them,"
Valde/ said.
Aside from the costs of childcare, this
group has other non-traditional financial
problems. Although nearly everyone said
the\ were grateful lor the generosity of
the ()llice of Financial Aid, they also said
in general they were "just barely making
ends meet."
l he group has addressed the problem
ol living off of .1 typical undergraduate
budget when tliev have financial require
ments and responsibilities more similar to
graduate students.
for example, like all undergraduates,
the financial Aid Office considers the
housing budget of undergradute par
ents to be up to $8,000 dollars for hous
ing. However, this doesn't relied the
higher cost of living in Kscondido Village
or off campus. Students with children
cannot live in dorms, but their aid is not
adjusted to compensate for the increase
in living costs.
One place students have turned is to
public wellare and food stamps, though
the offices are far olfcampus, often a long
bus commute.
"Dealing with all of this is just another
whole level of bureaucracy that doesn't
work," I rot/.ky-Sirr said.
"We have to jump through hoops just

to secure the essentials," \ aide/ added.
Garcia has found tli.it he can manage
with the same financial aid budget as .1 tra
ditional undergraduate student, but lie
expresses concern for some of the other
undergraduate parents.
"It would be impossible for me to make
it here 011 the budget tliev give us if I did
not have the other resources. We are bare
ly making it, and that is with outside in
come." he said.
Sacrifices
While large expenses like housing are
concerns, smaller financial constraints are
important as well, for example, Garcia's
sons, Hemic Jr. and John, have found
that the schools in this area are much
more difficult than the schools back in
Phoenix, thus requiring tutoring.
Garcia, however, has found that he
doesn't have time to tutor them himself
and the cost of private tutors is too exor
bitant to make this a realistic option.
Leticia adds, "also, we can't aflbrd
music lessons for our sons." While this
isn't one of their larger problems, it's an
example of one of the many sacrifices
they've made for Garcia's education.
lo balance the obligations of her life,
Valdez has had to cut back on things that
many undergraduates take for granted.
"It's not so much of a c hallenge to Ik- a

good mom to [Alma] because I love here so
much, hul while I'm taking care oilier, other
things, like studying, must wait," she said.
"In order to give her the time that she
deserves, I save .ill of my studving until
alter she is asleep. 1 his means that about
twice <i week, I end up sta\ ing up through
the entile night. In addition, as head of
household, I have to maintain finances,
housekeeping. So there's 110 spate in mv
life for extracurricular activities .... I re
ally 011K have room lor Alma and school."
A sense of belonging
One thing that the members of this
group would like is to live in proximitv to
one another.
"Ii would serve me and my daughter in
a number ol positive wavs to have a com
munity of undergraduate families, just bv
assigning us housing units that are closer
to one another," Valde/ said.
Because they do not live in dormitories,
have resident assistants or the support ol
community houses, students with chil
dren must be far more independent than
the average Stanford student.
They do not have a typical support
network and would like to have under

graduate laniilv housing to make up for
this. KOl mam, living among graduate
students provides an inadequate sense of
community.
"I'm younger than the glad students
that live next 10 me, so I have encountered
condescending attitudes." Valde/ said.
"And it seems to me that nearly all of the
graduate stuclcnts in family housing have
a two-parent household, ver\ often with
stay-at-home moms.
" I he lii st question I get from graduate
parents is alwavs. 'Oil, what is vour hus
band siud\ ing?' 1 bis puis me at odds with
tlieni when I tr\ to communicate because
I'm younger, which leads to some conde
scending and ratlin inaccurate presump
tions because I'm a single parent."
"| I .iving here has) been good, but it's re
all) hard to get to know people, Garcia
said. "Cirad students are so far removed
from us. It would be nice if all the under
grad families live together with each
other's support."
I'lie solitude that comes from being an
undergraduate parent at Stanford is
echoed bv many of the other parents.
"I feel pretty isolated from the student
body," McCloud said. "I live off campus.

I'm quite a bit older than most people. And
then I have a child."
I'lie group would like to have an area in
Escondido Village where they can live
close together and perhaps a courtyard
with a playground lor their children.
B\ having an undergraduate-specific
housing facility, both tliev and their chil
dren would be closer to one another, mem
bers said.
In general, the group of undergraduate
parents I eel that ibis would give them back
some of the traditional undergraduate ex
perience— the dorm events, house meet
ings and socializing that they miss out on
bv being parents.
Yel while they have concerns, as I'rieto
said, "1 wouldn't really change my situa
tion for the world."
"I wouldn't want to be here at Stanford
without my daughter," Valdez said. "I'm
glad that she gels to see my success. I'm
glad that I have the opportunity 10 raise
her with this kind of value to education.
"Anv of the stresses from navigating all
that I do disappear whenT'ni with+icr: She
gives me relief from the sometimes-over
whelming deadlines.
"She's good for me."

Two-year-old Erielle plays on her bed in the room she shares with her mother, senior
Chrichelle McCloud. All of the undergradute families live in close quarters. Another mother,
Valdez (right) said that she appreciates the closeness of her relationship with her daughter.
There are so many negative impressions of single mothers. There's a social stigma that the
father makes the household complete and that single mothers are responsible for social
decay. I'm glad that I can share my successes with my daughter."

"It's hard but I've had three to four years [away] from here where I was able to develop an existence outside of Stanford," said Chrichelle McCloud. " It's not like there's a big hole in my life because I'm not going to frat parties. I have
classes and study and, well, she takes up a lot of my time.

"Many people would probably be surprised to
know that there are any students with children
here," she said.
Kathleen Sullivan, director of the Work-Life Of
fice, said however that the Universitv is aware of the
plight of undergraduate parents.
"There is a great deal to be done and mam issues
to address," she said. "We look forward to continu
ing to work with the undergraduate parents in sup
porting them during their studies at Stanford."
But many members of the group are frustrated
with the responses that they have been given. Said
McCloud, "They have organized groups to help' us.
but those we've met with claim to have no power to
actually help us. so little has been done. All that
we've gotten from the people we've met are refresh
ments and excuses why they can't change anything
to really help us."
One of the group's main concerns is that there
are other undergraduate parents at Stanford who
feel alone in their struggle to balance classwork and
parenting. These potential group members ma\
have simply not heard that there are other patents
out there, or a group of parents that meet regularly.
Senior Aniorita Valdez began her freshman \ ear
at Stanford in 1996 while in her third trimester ol
pregnancy with daughter Alma, who is now nearh
4. After the first quarter she stopped out for two
and-a-half years.
"When I left after my first quarter I knew as
many people as when I got here," she said. "I lived
in EV but I didn't have the benefit of many re
sources for institutional or social orientation that
traditional students benefit from. I thought that 1
was surely the only undergraduate with or expect
ing a child, and there was no branch of the univer
sity that could tell me otherwise.
"It was incredibly isolating. While I was reallv ex
cited to come here, I didn't feel like I was in a safe
place, and it felt overwhelming. I'm luck\ because 1
have wonderful family support, but being around
others with similar experiences and concerns lias
really helped," she added.
Identifying fellow parents is just one of the prob
lems group members face. In the academic world
where papers, exams and problems sets are gener
ally the paramount concerns of students, one of the
top issues of this group is childcare.
1 here is generally a two-year waiting list for cam
pus daycare and even then the cost is often bevond
a student's budget.
Senior Bernie Garcia said, "We keep running up
against inflexible systems. People say that 'we can't
make an exception for one person,' even il this one
person is struggling to maintain family and cours
es."
"The only thing that I approached the Universi
ty with was my need for childcare," sophomore Lisa
Prieto said. Rather than put her son on the "ridicu
lously long waiting list" for Bing Nursery School,
she hoped that she would be able to find something
more affordable once she and her husband arrived
at Stanford.
After days spent looking for childcare, she now
admits, "Boy, was I ever wrong."
Instead, Preito's husband had to rearrange his
schedule to take care of their son during the day
while she is in class. When Prieto gets home from
school, her husband goes to work until late into the
night.
She said that this schedule "has proved difficult.
Studying doesn't take place until after my husband
gets out of work, which is usually around 10 or 11.
It also means late nights reading and no shuteyc vir
tually every night."
Childcare hard to find
Considering the high demand for childcare in
the Bay Area and the popularity of Stanford's facil
ities—Bing has a two year waiting list— some stu

deiiis have had to turn to daycare in other cotnmu
niies.
1 he < omniuic to these places, sometimes via pub

As her eighteen-month-old son Zev plays with her computer, senior Rebecca Trotzky-Sirr talks about the economic pressure she faces as an undergraduate parent. "It's so iron

that food?" she said.

'They used to have their own rooms," said senior Bernie Garcia when talking about his sons Bernie Jr. and John. "But
I wasn't getting any work done and had my papers spread all over the living room. Now they share a room and I
have an office."
I Humilities lor its student body and day
care should be included among them,"
Valde/ said.
Aside from the costs of childcare, this
group has other non-traditional financial
problems. Although nearly everyone said
the\ were grateful lor the generosity of
the ()llice of Financial Aid, they also said
in general they were "just barely making
ends meet."
l he group has addressed the problem
ol living off of .1 typical undergraduate
budget when tliev have financial require
ments and responsibilities more similar to
graduate students.
for example, like all undergraduates,
the financial Aid Office considers the
housing budget of undergradute par
ents to be up to $8,000 dollars for hous
ing. However, this doesn't relied the
higher cost of living in Kscondido Village
or off campus. Students with children
cannot live in dorms, but their aid is not
adjusted to compensate for the increase
in living costs.
One place students have turned is to
public wellare and food stamps, though
the offices are far olfcampus, often a long
bus commute.
"Dealing with all of this is just another
whole level of bureaucracy that doesn't
work," I rot/.ky-Sirr said.
"We have to jump through hoops just

to secure the essentials," \ aide/ added.
Garcia has found tli.it he can manage
with the same financial aid budget as .1 tra
ditional undergraduate student, but lie
expresses concern for some of the other
undergraduate parents.
"It would be impossible for me to make
it here 011 the budget tliev give us if I did
not have the other resources. We are bare
ly making it, and that is with outside in
come." he said.
Sacrifices
While large expenses like housing are
concerns, smaller financial constraints are
important as well, for example, Garcia's
sons, Hemic Jr. and John, have found
that the schools in this area are much
more difficult than the schools back in
Phoenix, thus requiring tutoring.
Garcia, however, has found that he
doesn't have time to tutor them himself
and the cost of private tutors is too exor
bitant to make this a realistic option.
Leticia adds, "also, we can't aflbrd
music lessons for our sons." While this
isn't one of their larger problems, it's an
example of one of the many sacrifices
they've made for Garcia's education.
lo balance the obligations of her life,
Valdez has had to cut back on things that
many undergraduates take for granted.
"It's not so much of a c hallenge to Ik- a

good mom to [Alma] because I love here so
much, hul while I'm taking care oilier, other
things, like studying, must wait," she said.
"In order to give her the time that she
deserves, I save .ill of my studving until
alter she is asleep. 1 his means that about
twice <i week, I end up sta\ ing up through
the entile night. In addition, as head of
household, I have to maintain finances,
housekeeping. So there's 110 spate in mv
life for extracurricular activities .... I re
ally 011K have room lor Alma and school."
A sense of belonging
One thing that the members of this
group would like is to live in proximitv to
one another.
"Ii would serve me and my daughter in
a number ol positive wavs to have a com
munity of undergraduate families, just bv
assigning us housing units that are closer
to one another," Valde/ said.
Because they do not live in dormitories,
have resident assistants or the support ol
community houses, students with chil
dren must be far more independent than
the average Stanford student.
They do not have a typical support
network and would like to have under

graduate laniilv housing to make up for
this. KOl mam, living among graduate
students provides an inadequate sense of
community.
"I'm younger than the glad students
that live next 10 me, so I have encountered
condescending attitudes." Valde/ said.
"And it seems to me that nearly all of the
graduate stuclcnts in family housing have
a two-parent household, ver\ often with
stay-at-home moms.
" I he lii st question I get from graduate
parents is alwavs. 'Oil, what is vour hus
band siud\ ing?' 1 bis puis me at odds with
tlieni when I tr\ to communicate because
I'm younger, which leads to some conde
scending and ratlin inaccurate presump
tions because I'm a single parent."
"| I .iving here has) been good, but it's re
all) hard to get to know people, Garcia
said. "Cirad students are so far removed
from us. It would be nice if all the under
grad families live together with each
other's support."
I'lie solitude that comes from being an
undergraduate parent at Stanford is
echoed bv many of the other parents.
"I feel pretty isolated from the student
body," McCloud said. "I live off campus.

I'm quite a bit older than most people. And
then I have a child."
I'lie group would like to have an area in
Escondido Village where they can live
close together and perhaps a courtyard
with a playground lor their children.
B\ having an undergraduate-specific
housing facility, both tliev and their chil
dren would be closer to one another, mem
bers said.
In general, the group of undergraduate
parents I eel that ibis would give them back
some of the traditional undergraduate ex
perience— the dorm events, house meet
ings and socializing that they miss out on
bv being parents.
Yel while they have concerns, as I'rieto
said, "1 wouldn't really change my situa
tion for the world."
"I wouldn't want to be here at Stanford
without my daughter," Valdez said. "I'm
glad that she gels to see my success. I'm
glad that I have the opportunity 10 raise
her with this kind of value to education.
"Anv of the stresses from navigating all
that I do disappear whenT'ni with+icr: She

"As a single mom, personal strength and independence are really important to me. But it is also important to have institutional support in order

classes and study and, well, she takes up a lot of my time.
In the toy-strewn room of transfer student Re
becca Trotzky-Sirr's Escondido Village apart
ment, a group of undergraduate parents gath
ered a few days ago to discuss the recent state
ment issued by the Work-Life Office in regard to
campus childcare.
1 lie group felt that this statement not only failed
to address any of their problems, but also failed to
acknowledge their existence. This network of par
ents is also pressed for time, as today Provost John
Etchemendy is expected to make a statement about
the University's position on childcare.
The apartment is filled with children and their
undergraduate parents who have been meeting on
and of 112 lor the last two years.
These meetings, they say, are a time lor them to
gain strength from other people with similar prob
lems and triumphs. It is a time lor them to socialize
and for their children to play together. And it is a
time for these unique parents — most ol them ex
traordinary students as well — to organize so that
over the noise of children, bureaucracy and financial
constraints, their voices can still be heard.
Personal struggles
This lack of recognition was more disappointing
to the undergraduate parents than it was surprising.
"In general, Stanford caters to the traditional stu

"It was incredibly isolating. While I was reallv ex
cited to come here, I didn't feel like I was in a safe
place, and it felt overwhelming. I'm luck\ because 1
have wonderful family support, but being around
others with similar experiences and concerns lias
really helped," she added.
Identifying fellow parents is just one of the prob
lems group members face. In the academic world
where papers, exams and problems sets are gener
ally the paramount concerns of students, one of the
top issues of this group is childcare.
1 here is generally a two-year waiting list for cam
pus daycare and even then the cost is often bevond
a student's budget.
Senior Bernie Garcia said, "We keep running up
against inflexible systems. People say that 'we can't
make an exception for one person,' even il this one
person is struggling to maintain family and cours
es."
"The only thing that I approached the Universi
ty with was my need for childcare," sophomore Lisa
Prieto said. Rather than put her son on the "ridicu
lously long waiting list" for Bing Nursery School,
she hoped that she would be able to find something
more affordable once she and her husband arrived
at Stanford.
After days spent looking for childcare, she now
admits, "Boy, was I ever wrong."
Instead, Preito's husband had to rearrange his
schedule to take care of their son during the day
while she is in class. When Prieto gets home from
school, her husband goes to work until late into the
night.
She said that this schedule "has proved difficult.
Studying doesn't take place until after my husband
gets out of work, which is usually around 10 or 11.
It also means late nights reading and no shuteyc vir
tually every night."
Childcare hard to find
Considering the high demand for childcare in
the Bay Area and the popularity of Stanford's facil
ities—Bing has a two year waiting list— some stu

deiiis have had to turn to daycare in other cotnmu
niies.
1 he < omniuic to these places, sometimes via pub

As her eighteen-month-old son Zev plays with her computer, senior Rebecca Trotzky-Sirr talks about the economic pressure she faces as an undergraduate parent. "It's so iron

that food?" she said.

'They used to have their own rooms," said senior Bernie Garcia when talking about his sons Bernie Jr. and John. "But
I wasn't getting any work done and had my papers spread all over the living room. Now they share a room and I
have an office."
I Humilities lor its student body and day
care should be included among them,"
Valde/ said.
Aside from the costs of childcare, this
group has other non-traditional financial
problems. Although nearly everyone said
the\ were grateful lor the generosity of
the ()llice of Financial Aid, they also said
in general they were "just barely making
ends meet."
l he group has addressed the problem
ol living off of .1 typical undergraduate
budget when tliev have financial require
ments and responsibilities more similar to
graduate students.
for example, like all undergraduates,
the financial Aid Office considers the
housing budget of undergradute par
ents to be up to $8,000 dollars for hous
ing. However, this doesn't relied the
higher cost of living in Kscondido Village
or off campus. Students with children
cannot live in dorms, but their aid is not
adjusted to compensate for the increase
in living costs.
One place students have turned is to
public wellare and food stamps, though
the offices are far olfcampus, often a long
bus commute.
"Dealing with all of this is just another
whole level of bureaucracy that doesn't
work," I rot/.ky-Sirr said.
"We have to jump through hoops just

to secure the essentials," \ aide/ added.
Garcia has found tli.it he can manage
with the same financial aid budget as .1 tra
ditional undergraduate student, but lie
expresses concern for some of the other
undergraduate parents.
"It would be impossible for me to make
it here 011 the budget tliev give us if I did
not have the other resources. We are bare
ly making it, and that is with outside in
come." he said.
Sacrifices
While large expenses like housing are
concerns, smaller financial constraints are
important as well, for example, Garcia's
sons, Hemic Jr. and John, have found
that the schools in this area are much
more difficult than the schools back in
Phoenix, thus requiring tutoring.
Garcia, however, has found that he
doesn't have time to tutor them himself
and the cost of private tutors is too exor
bitant to make this a realistic option.
Leticia adds, "also, we can't aflbrd
music lessons for our sons." While this
isn't one of their larger problems, it's an
example of one of the many sacrifices
they've made for Garcia's education.
lo balance the obligations of her life,
Valdez has had to cut back on things that
many undergraduates take for granted.
"It's not so much of a c hallenge to Ik- a

good mom to [Alma] because I love here so
much, hul while I'm taking care oilier, other
things, like studying, must wait," she said.
"In order to give her the time that she
deserves, I save .ill of my studving until
alter she is asleep. 1 his means that about
twice <i week, I end up sta\ ing up through
the entile night. In addition, as head of
household, I have to maintain finances,
housekeeping. So there's 110 spate in mv
life for extracurricular activities .... I re
ally 011K have room lor Alma and school."
A sense of belonging
One thing that the members of this
group would like is to live in proximitv to
one another.
"Ii would serve me and my daughter in
a number ol positive wavs to have a com
munity of undergraduate families, just bv
assigning us housing units that are closer
to one another," Valde/ said.
Because they do not live in dormitories,
have resident assistants or the support ol
community houses, students with chil
dren must be far more independent than
the average Stanford student.
They do not have a typical support
network and would like to have under

graduate laniilv housing to make up for
this. KOl mam, living among graduate
students provides an inadequate sense of
community.
"I'm younger than the glad students
that live next 10 me, so I have encountered
condescending attitudes." Valde/ said.
"And it seems to me that nearly all of the
graduate stuclcnts in family housing have
a two-parent household, ver\ often with
stay-at-home moms.
" I he lii st question I get from graduate
parents is alwavs. 'Oil, what is vour hus
band siud\ ing?' 1 bis puis me at odds with
tlieni when I tr\ to communicate because
I'm younger, which leads to some conde
scending and ratlin inaccurate presump
tions because I'm a single parent."
"| I .iving here has) been good, but it's re
all) hard to get to know people, Garcia
said. "Cirad students are so far removed
from us. It would be nice if all the under
grad families live together with each
other's support."
I'lie solitude that comes from being an
undergraduate parent at Stanford is
echoed bv many of the other parents.
"I feel pretty isolated from the student
body," McCloud said. "I live off campus.

I'm quite a bit older than most people. And
then I have a child."
I'lie group would like to have an area in
Escondido Village where they can live
close together and perhaps a courtyard
with a playground lor their children.
B\ having an undergraduate-specific
housing facility, both tliev and their chil
dren would be closer to one another, mem
bers said.
In general, the group of undergraduate
parents I eel that ibis would give them back
some of the traditional undergraduate ex
perience— the dorm events, house meet
ings and socializing that they miss out on
bv being parents.
Yel while they have concerns, as I'rieto
said, "1 wouldn't really change my situa
tion for the world."
"I wouldn't want to be here at Stanford
without my daughter," Valdez said. "I'm
glad that she gels to see my success. I'm
glad that I have the opportunity 10 raise
her with this kind of value to education.
"Anv of the stresses from navigating all
that I do disappear whenT'ni with+icr: She
gives me relief from the sometimes-over

"As a single mom, personal strength and independence are really important to me. But it is also important to have institutional support in order
to maintain higher education as a benefit ratner than a burden," said senior Amorita Valdez from her Escondido Village home. Valdez is
with her daughter Alma and Rebecca's Trotzky-Sirr's son Zev, whom she is babysitting.

"It's hard but I've had three to four years [away] from here where I was able to develop an existence outside of Stanford," said Chrichelle McCloud. " It's not like there's a big hole in my life because I'm not going to frat parties. I have
classes and study and, well, she takes up a lot of my time.
In the toy-strewn room of transfer student Re
becca Trotzky-Sirr's Escondido Village apart
ment, a group of undergraduate parents gath
ered a few days ago to discuss the recent state
ment issued by the Work-Life Office in regard to
campus childcare.
1 lie group felt that this statement not only failed
to address any of their problems, but also failed to
acknowledge their existence. This network of par
ents is also pressed for time, as today Provost John
Etchemendy is expected to make a statement about
the University's position on childcare.
The apartment is filled with children and their
undergraduate parents who have been meeting on
and of 112 lor the last two years.
These meetings, they say, are a time lor them to
gain strength from other people with similar prob
lems and triumphs. It is a time lor them to socialize
and for their children to play together. And it is a
time for these unique parents — most ol them ex
traordinary students as well — to organize so that
over the noise of children, bureaucracy and financial
constraints, their voices can still be heard.
Personal struggles
This lack of recognition was more disappointing
to the undergraduate parents than it was surprising.
"In general, Stanford caters to the traditional stu
dent and figures that the student body lias verv ho
mogenous needs," said senior Chrichelle McC loud.
McCloud began at Stanford as a typical lreshman in
the lall of 1993. In the middle of her junior vear she
decided to take a year off. That year eventualh be
came four years, and when she returned, she came
with Erielle, her 2-year-old daughter.
"Many people would probably be surprised to
know that there are any students with children
here," she said.
Kathleen Sullivan, director of the Work-Life Of
fice, said however that the Universitv is aware of the
plight of undergraduate parents.
"There is a great deal to be done and mam issues
to address," she said. "We look forward to continu
ing to work with the undergraduate parents in sup
porting them during their studies at Stanford."
But many members of the group are frustrated
with the responses that they have been given. Said
McCloud, "They have organized groups to help' us.
but those we've met with claim to have no power to
actually help us. so little has been done. All that
we've gotten from the people we've met are refresh
ments and excuses why they can't change anything
to really help us."
One of the group's main concerns is that there
are other undergraduate parents at Stanford who
feel alone in their struggle to balance classwork and
parenting. These potential group members ma\
have simply not heard that there are other patents
out there, or a group of parents that meet regularly.
Senior Aniorita Valdez began her freshman \ ear
at Stanford in 1996 while in her third trimester ol
pregnancy with daughter Alma, who is now nearh
4. After the first quarter she stopped out for two
and-a-half years.
"When I left after my first quarter I knew as
many people as when I got here," she said. "I lived
in EV but I didn't have the benefit of many re
sources for institutional or social orientation that
traditional students benefit from. I thought that 1
was surely the only undergraduate with or expect
ing a child, and there was no branch of the univer
sity that could tell me otherwise.
"It was incredibly isolating. While I was reallv ex
cited to come here, I didn't feel like I was in a safe
