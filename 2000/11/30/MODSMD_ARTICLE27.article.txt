# UNDERGRADUATE FAMILIES
## Drawing the Line Between Family and Studies 
### EMILY YATES-DOERR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the toy-strewn room of transfer student Re
becca Trotzky-Sirr's Escondido Village apart
ment, a group of undergraduate parents gath
ered a few days ago to discuss the recent state
ment issued by the Work-Life Office in regard to
campus childcare.
1 lie group felt that this statement not only failed
to address any of their problems, but also failed to
acknowledge their existence. This network of par
ents is also pressed for time, as today Provost John
Etchemendy is expected to make a statement about
the University's position on childcare.
The apartment is filled with children and their
undergraduate parents who have been meeting on
and of 112 lor the last two years.
These meetings, they say, are a time lor them to
gain strength from other people with similar prob
lems and triumphs. It is a time lor them to socialize
and for their children to play together. And it is a
time for these unique parents — most ol them ex
traordinary students as well — to organize so that
over the noise of children, bureaucracy and financial
constraints, their voices can still be heard.
Personal struggles
This lack of recognition was more disappointing
to the undergraduate parents than it was surprising.
"In general, Stanford caters to the traditional stu
dent and figures that the student body lias verv ho
mogenous needs," said senior Chrichelle McC loud.
McCloud began at Stanford as a typical lreshman in
the lall of 1993. In the middle of her junior vear she
decided to take a year off. That year eventualh be
came four years, and when she returned, she came
with Erielle, her 2-year-old daughter.
"Many people would probably be surprised to
know that there are any students with children
here," she said.
Kathleen Sullivan, director of the Work-Life Of
fice, said however that the Universitv is aware of the
plight of undergraduate parents.
"There is a great deal to be done and mam issues
to address," she said. "We look forward to continu
ing to work with the undergraduate parents in sup
porting them during their studies at Stanford."
But many members of the group are frustrated
with the responses that they have been given. Said
McCloud, "They have organized groups to help' us.
but those we've met with claim to have no power to
actually help us. so little has been done. All that
we've gotten from the people we've met are refresh
ments and excuses why they can't change anything
to really help us."
One of the group's main concerns is that there
are other undergraduate parents at Stanford who
feel alone in their struggle to balance classwork and
parenting. These potential group members ma\
have simply not heard that there are other patents
out there, or a group of parents that meet regularly.
Senior Aniorita Valdez began her freshman \ ear
at Stanford in 1996 while in her third trimester ol
pregnancy with daughter Alma, who is now nearh
4. After the first quarter she stopped out for two
and-a-half years.
"When I left after my first quarter I knew as
many people as when I got here," she said. "I lived
in EV but I didn't have the benefit of many re
sources for institutional or social orientation that
traditional students benefit from. I thought that 1
was surely the only undergraduate with or expect
ing a child, and there was no branch of the univer
sity that could tell me otherwise.
"It was incredibly isolating. While I was reallv ex
cited to come here, I didn't feel like I was in a safe
place, and it felt overwhelming. I'm luck\ because 1
have wonderful family support, but being around
others with similar experiences and concerns lias
really helped," she added.
Identifying fellow parents is just one of the prob
lems group members face. In the academic world
where papers, exams and problems sets are gener
ally the paramount concerns of students, one of the
top issues of this group is childcare.
1 here is generally a two-year waiting list for cam
pus daycare and even then the cost is often bevond
a student's budget.
Senior Bernie Garcia said, "We keep running up
against inflexible systems. People say that 'we can't
make an exception for one person,' even il this one
person is struggling to maintain family and cours
es."
"The only thing that I approached the Universi
ty with was my need for childcare," sophomore Lisa
Prieto said. Rather than put her son on the "ridicu
lously long waiting list" for Bing Nursery School,
she hoped that she would be able to find something
more affordable once she and her husband arrived
at Stanford.
After days spent looking for childcare, she now
admits, "Boy, was I ever wrong."
Instead, Preito's husband had to rearrange his
schedule to take care of their son during the day
while she is in class. When Prieto gets home from
school, her husband goes to work until late into the
night.
She said that this schedule "has proved difficult.
Studying doesn't take place until after my husband
gets out of work, which is usually around 10 or 11.
It also means late nights reading and no shuteyc vir
tually every night."
Childcare hard to find
Considering the high demand for childcare in
the Bay Area and the popularity of Stanford's facil
ities—Bing has a two year waiting list— some stu

deiiis have had to turn to daycare in other cotnmu
niies.

lit transportation, can lake hours that could poten
lialh be used for siu< 1\ .md work. Prieto said that she
was hit k\ to find am place at all. "I was not ready for
how hard it would be, waking up two hours bclbre
m\ firsi (l.iss to get m\ son readx and take him to
daycare oil campus."

"As a single mom, personal strength and inde

As her eighteen-month-old son Zev plays with her computer, senior Rebecca Trotzky-Sirr talks about the economic pressure she faces as an undergraduate parent. "It's so iron
ic to sit through my economic classes that talk about how horrible welfare is. I had one of my TA's over to dinner last year and was thinking the whole time, guess what bought
that food?" she said.

'They used to have their own rooms," said senior Bernie Garcia when talking about his sons Bernie Jr. and John. "But
I wasn't getting any work done and had my papers spread all over the living room. Now they share a room and I
have an office."
