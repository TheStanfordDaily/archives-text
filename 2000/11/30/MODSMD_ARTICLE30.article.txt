Something's not right when 10 minutes
into the first half of a Stanford men's bas
ketball game, the oth Man (Hub's loudest
cheer is for "Teen Wolf a.La. Mark
Vanta, UC-Riverside's back-up small for
ward. so-called because of his long hair,
long sideburns and a soul patch under
neath his mouth.
In a first half marred by missed layups
and 20 turnovers, it was difficult to cheer
tor anybodv, especially considering that
this was the Cardinal's second straight
home matchup against an overmatched
California opponent.
Unlike San Francisco State, at least I C-
Rivet side finally made ii out of l)i\ ision 11
ihis year.
The crowd was animated more for the
third graders at halftime than their college
counterparts.
Perhaps the only reasons that the Stan
ford faithful didn't leave at halftime were:
1) they didn't want to study for finals, and
2) they wanted lo boost their egos a little
more and brag to their friends at Duke
and Arizona that the ( ardinal beat anoth
er team In more than 40 points.
The game was not as prett\ lor Stan
ford as the lopsided final score implies.
Despite Stanford's three solid wins in
the Puerto Rico Shootout over Fhanksgiv
ing break, last night's contest, il vou can
call it that, demonstrated that the ('.ardinal
has a lot to work on belore il takes on No.
1 Duke Dec. 21 at the Pete Newell Chal
lenge in ()akland.
"We were a little sloppv." Montgomery

said. "We shouldn't have had 10
turnovers."
In addition to the turnovers, the Cardi
nal failed to score lor a five-minute stretch
in the first half when point guard Mike
McDonald left the game.
On the oilier hand, Stanford also
showed why il is the No. 3 team in the na
tion.
Flie Highlanders and their 0-foot-8
center had no chance to match i he Collins
twins inside.
"Obviously, I think [the gamej was a
tough situation for Riverside,' said Sum
lord head coach Mike Montgomery.
"We're awfully big. Il was just tough for
litem lo get a good shot off, and I think
our size caused them problems.''
I he Highlanders didn't appear that
undersized from their roster. While Stan
ford may be known for grade inflation, the
people who write FC-Riverside s roster
should be known for height inflation.
Flie Highlander's point guard Frencll
Fddings was most likely the shortest "5-
10" person ever to take the court at
Maples. When Stanford's 0-1 point guard
1111 ill s Barnes has a monster bloc k, things
are definitely a little out of hand.
Redshirt sophomore Jason Collins tied
a career-high with 19 points and 1 1 re
bounds, while twin brother Jarron had a
double-double also, adding 12 points and
12 boards. Stanford out rebounded UC-
Riverside 17-20.
When sophomore big men Curtis (the
Mantis) Borchardl and |usiis Davis recov
er from injuiics, the Cardinal's size will
play an important role as the heart of the
season and competitive teams approach.
