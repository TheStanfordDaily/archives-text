# Interracial couples thrive at Stanford while facing cultural, family conflicts

George W. Bush's visit to Bob Jones Uni
versity in February drew attacks upon his fail
ure to criticize the private school's anti-
Catholic and anti-Mormon Web-page state
ments and its ban on interracial dating. ()rigi
nally implemented in 19505, the ban prevent
ed Asians and Caucasians from dating.
The ban is now lilted at the university, yet it
is evident that the interracial dating issue is not
dead, even on the Stanford campus.
"I have a very traditional Chinese family,"
one freshman female said, "and 1 know they
would totally not approve of me having a
boyfriend who's not Chinese too."
Others find themselves with familial pres
sures to marry within their culture.
"The hardest part to deal with [dating inter
racially] with me is my family," stated Dorcas
Cheng, a Chinese-American senior who has
been dating a non-Asian American for two and
a half years, "li makes my mom a bit uncom
fortable because of the communication prob

lems, but for me, it's not that big of an issue."
Cheng's boyfriend, senior Ned To/un, was
a product of an interracial marriage himself,
between a Muslim from Cyprus and a Jewish
American. He said his parent's family in
Cyprus was very supportive of the* marriage
while the American side was more averse to 11u
match.
"People here in [America] seem more sensi
tive about race," To/un said. "Ii might be an
American thing about keeping their culture."
As for interracial dating at Stanford, most
students agree that it is generally accepted.
"I think |interracial dating) is line as long as
your motives are right â€” if two people reall\
like or love each oilier and not because of a
racial status thing," said lalitha Parish, an
African-American senior.
"Stanford's very accepting and pretty libei -
al in that sense," To/un said.
"I never had a problem with |dating inter
racially]. It's just that people tend to look ;ii
others differently if tliev man) people of
other races," said Yvonne Rodriguez, a I.ati-

na freshman.
Karen Milch, a C Caucasian freshman, is dat
ing a Jewish man born in Mexico whose family
is originally from Syria.
"I can't really say it's affec ted anything, but
it's really cool because he has a whole different
background and view on things," Milch said.
1 fowever, students' opinions differ as to the
prevalence ol interracial dating at Stanford.
" I here's not much dating, period, so inter
racial dating just doesn't seem to be present,"
junior (irace Yin said.
"I'd say there's a lot of |interracial dating].
Stanford's very diverse, so it seems natural that
it would occur," said |osh kallman, a Cau
casian sophomore.
I his conflicting assessment of the status ol
interracial dating on campus, however, has no
slatistical backing.
"People take the few couples they do see
and can't help but make generalizations," said
Seno Lama). an African-American senior.

Yet there are certain widespread
ideas.
"I think [interracial dating] is just av
erage here but it's mostly between
Asians and Caucasians,'" said senior
Derek C.liang, who has dated Cau
casians. "People make more of a big deal
here. Back home |in Austin, I'exas| , I
didn't even reali/e it was inter"racial dat
ing."
"I think there's inter-cnitnral dating, .is
with Asians and whites, Imi not as much
with Asians and blacks and there isn't
much black/white dating," said Yodii
Aravn, an Afrit an-American senior.
"i have no problem with a white guv

and an Asian girl, bin instinctively, you
have to wonder," saitl one senior Asian-
American male. "It might be that 'exotic
factor,' and I know a couple white guys
who only go lor Asian girls."
Researcher Sue Chow has been in
vestigating Asian-American spousal
preferences and studied the dynamics
ol Asian-American and Caucasian dat
ing. In a recent study of 154 college
educated Asian-American men and
women, some from Stanford, UC
lierkeley and I (TA. 72 out of the 81
women (88.9 percent) said thev had
experience with dating Caucasians.
Yet M"> ol 7l\ men (47.9 percent) relat
ed that they had dated a Caucasian
woman.
"This is where gender dynamics
come in," said Chow. "Iliis is still a
male-dominated society with white

men at I lie lop of the hierarchy. Men
feel they must be the dominant ones
and Asian women appeal to them be
cause of the perception that they can
be more easily controlled.''
( how went on to cite one case in her
study in which an Asian-American
woman in her early .'<os ended a live-
Near relationship with a Caucasian
male who said at the end, 1 thought
Asian women were more compliant."
"Likewise, black lemales, who have
the stereotvpe ol being dominant and
aggressive, don't date as main white
males, although ili.it might also have
something lo do with historical ani
mosity," Chow said. " These are all
slereoi\ pes and ol i ourse I'm no! sure
if they're I rue, but main people dale
others according to slereotypes, at
least in ihe beginning."
