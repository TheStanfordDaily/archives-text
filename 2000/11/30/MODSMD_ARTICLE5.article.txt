# Outside grants mean less aid from University
## 
### JIMMY WU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Students sometimes pursue scholarships from out
side sources, including corporations and charitable or
ganizations, to help finance their education with theex
pcctat ion that they will reduce the financial burden on
them and their families.
I iowever, Stanford uses money from these scholar
ships to reduce loans, work-study and University schol
arships before it applies these funds to lessen the fami
ly's contribution to the total cost of a year at Stanford.
Financial-aid packages are composed of a family
contribution, a University contribution and a self-help
contribution. The student and his family pay the fami
ly contribution from their own assets.
1 'he University contribution consists of scholarships
from the University. I he self-help portion consists of
student loans and earnings from on<ampus jobs.
