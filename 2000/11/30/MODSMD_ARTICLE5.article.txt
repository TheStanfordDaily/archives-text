# Outside grants mean less aid from University
## 
### JIMMY WU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Students sometimes pursue scholarships from out
side sources, including corporations and charitable or
ganizations, to help finance their education with theex
pcctat ion that they will reduce the financial burden on
them and their families.
I iowever, Stanford uses money from these scholar
ships to reduce loans, work-study and University schol
arships before it applies these funds to lessen the fami
ly's contribution to the total cost of a year at Stanford.
Financial-aid packages are composed of a family
contribution, a University contribution and a self-help
contribution. The student and his family pay the fami
ly contribution from their own assets.
1 'he University contribution consists of scholarships
from the University. I he self-help portion consists of
student loans and earnings from on<ampus jobs.
According lo Dircc U)r t>i Finan
cial Aid Planning and Policy Analy
sis ( a nthia I lartlev. when a student
receives an outside scholarship
from .1 corporation or organiza
tion, n fust reduces the student's
job earning expectations and stu
dent loan amounts.
Once the sell-help money is
eliminated, am Stanford scholar

contribution.
()ne freshman said she was dis
appointed when she realized that
her outside scholarship money
would not reduce I he amount that
she .ind her liunilx would have to
pay.
For example, Stanlord might
calculate thai a family can pay
$ 15,0000f the $35,000 tuition. I lie
I niversily, work-study and stu
dent loans would cover the remain
ing $20,000.
For this student, a $30,000 out
side scholarship would lirst elimi
nate ilic $20,000 of scholarships,
work-stud\ and loans, and then re
duce the family's contribution In
$10,000, leaving $5,000 for the stu
dent .ind I lis familv lo pay.

Morrison, the polic\ islairl) new.
"I niil two to three vears ago we
did not eliminate all loans and jobs
but instead kept a minimum level
of need-based sell-help," she said.
"We iniKxluced [the new] policv
primariK as a wa\ of recognizing
the ellbrts that our students make
in the process of securing these ad
ditional resources and because we
had funding available for the polic \
change," I lartley said.
Morrison explained that Stan
lord cannot use outside scholar
ships to first eliminate a student's
famih contribution, because that
contradicts the I nited Slates De
partment ol Education's policv.
" flic Department ol Education
does not allow us to eliminate the

EEC and still award Pell grants,
SEC )(1 giants, Cal Grants, Stafford
loans, Perkins loans, etc.," she said.
Morrison noted that Stanlord
does not have the financial re
sources to replace the millions of
dollars that it receives from these
governmental sources every year.
One sophomore said,"The
pr< k ess makes sense financially, but
it is extremely disappointing for
students . , . who spent a great
amount of time in high school ap
plying lor several scholarships just
to lind that the little the school was
going to help disappeared as I
handed in thousands of dollars ol
hard-earned scholarship money."
"1 think that the University
should not take money out of|a stu
dent's] University scholarship [clue
to] an outside scholarship, because
this increases the burden on the
students and the parents," said
freshman Rose Edmonds.
To answer these concerns, Mor
rison said that these government
programs rely heavily on the as
sumption that families should pay
what iliev are able to pay.
"Parentsand students |have] the
primary responsibility for financ
ing educational costs." she said." Fi
nancial aid's purpose is to provide
the support [thatJ students cannot
get elsewhere. Fortunately. Stan
ford ( an a (lord to provide support
to meet need, but onlv if the fami
lies do their part, too."
Morrison also believes that the
policv does not neglect a student's
hard work in applv ing lor scholar
ships. "1 do not think that keeping
a person from hav ing debt and giv
ing them the chance to go to school
without having to work is penaliz
ing Iliciii." she said.
Some students view the policy
more positively.
