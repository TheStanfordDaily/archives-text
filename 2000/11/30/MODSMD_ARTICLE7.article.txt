### MARK DOMINIK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Hie Faculty Senate does not eon jure up images ol
controversy to the normal Stan lord mind. Yet lewotliei
University governing bodies can claim that the Re\
Jesse Jackson protested outside their meetings.
"When the Senate changed the Western < i\ ili/attoi
requirement to ( IV, we had Jesse Jackson outside tlu
meeting," said Trish Del Pozzo, assistant academic sec
retary to the University.
" There were also demonstrators at the Senate dm
ing the negotiations between hospital workers and the
University,"' ()sgood said.
Another controversy occurred when the I niversit\
was considering building the Ronald Reagan Presiden
tial Library in the Foothills, according to Del Pozzo.
I he Senate is charged with the formidable task ol at
ticulatitig the I niversity s academic policies and acade
mic mission. Although it adopts most polities withou
amtroversy, the alxive examples show its decision!
sometimes cany profound impacts.
Hie Senate enacts policies on issues varying Irom tlu
Introduction to the Humanities
program to "Openness in Re
search," and, in doing so, shapes the
academic character of the I Jniversi
ty.
" The Senate is mainly c< >ncerned
with issues of academic policy," said
Del Pozzo. "All grading and teach
ing policies are approved by the
Senate."
One of the Senate s primary
charges is the evaluation ol new de
partments and interdepartmental
programs.
"()nlv the Senate can authorize a
department or an interdepartmen
tal program to grant degrees." said
Brad ()sg<x>d, professor of electrical
engineering and ( hair < >1 the 112 acul
ty Senate. "While departments that
already exist do not need to petition
ihe Senate lor the authority to grant
degrees, all new programs must do
so.
Though the Senate does not allo
cate any money directly, the Senate
can take ac tion that requires the dis
bursement of funds, such .is < hang
ing academic requirements.
"An action that the Senate ap
proved a number of years ago that
had financial repercussions was the
transition from ( IV to 1-1 It tin." said
()sgood.
Much ol the Senate's work is
done in committee. Seven Academ
ic Council committees report to the
Senate's Steering Committee. Cen
erally, "seven faculty members,
three students and a lew non-voting
ex-ollicio members serve on each
committee," Del Pozzo said.
Fora policv dec ision lo reach the
Senate lloor, a committee must de
bate ilie issue and makes .1 recom
mendation 011 it. Iliis recommen
dation is passed 011 to the Steering
Committee, which schedules when
the item is to be disc ussed and voted
on in the full Senate.
Two other committees repoi 1 lo
the Senate. I lie Planning and Poli
ce Board works to guide the long
term academic vision of the I niver

sii\, .ind llit* Committee on Com
mittees works to regulate the com
plex s\ stem of academic committee
governance.
Asa whole, the commit tee system
works to filter appropriate legisla
tion to the Senate lloor and makes
recommendations .is to how the
Senate should vole on each policy.
While mam policies are passed
with little debate in the Senate, some
decisions have been both contested
in the past.
C ieneralh. demonstrations at the
Senate remain peaceful. Atten

who wish to hear reports being de
livered to the Senate must contact

solicit ,111 invitation.
While most legislation passes
without a great deal of outside inter
est, sometimes so many people re
quest invitations that television
monitors have to be erected outside

me meeting room.
The Senate is a relatively young
governing body bv University stan
dards. Before 1904, the University
administration made all the deci
sions the Senate currently approves.
I he (acuity (irst organized as a
legislative body known as the Ac ad

1900s, however, the faculty had
grown to such a si/e that it could 110

was formed in 1908 in order to ex
pedite the process of academic legis

In order that all interests ol the
I niversity be represented in acade

the Senate is elected from Idifler
