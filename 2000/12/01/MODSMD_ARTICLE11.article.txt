1976
On Dec . 1, 1976, The Daily reported on
tuition costs.
"Tuition will not rise by 12 percent as
predicted earlier, according to I niversity
Pres. Richard Lyman ....
" 'We're stuck between charging a price
so high that it discourages people from
coming here on one hand and charging a
more modest price fora much more modest
offering on the other hand, the president
said.
"I le claimed th.it the difference in tuition
costs lie mainly in the fact that Stanford re
ceives no government support.
"I le added, however, that university
studies indicate that the exorbitant tuition
here has not deterred qualified applicants
from applying and attending the institution
to any significant degree.'
Bottom line: Al2 percent tuition hike in one
year? Good thing they nipped that trend in the
bud, or the University's $1-billion fundraising
drive wouldn't stretch very far.
