tinian security, llamas officials
said they are demanding a
death sentence, to be carried
out at the spot where the car
exploded.
The bloodshed, .which has
claimed nearly 290 lives, most of
them Palestinians, has abated 111
recent days.
However, Palestinian areas
remain tense, and previous lulls
have been lbllowed by renewed
spasms of violence.
Barak has said repeatedly
that peace negotiations cannot
resume until the violence sub
sides substantially.
In a goodwill gesture, Israel
is allowing the Palestinian air
port in Gaza to reopen today,
said lave/ Zaidan, head of the
Palestinian civil aviation author
ity. l he airport has been c losed
for more than a month.
1 he prime minister said the
looming election would not
change his approach to peace
negotiations, though he trails in
the polls, and man) analysts say
he's unlikely to win re-election
unless he can produce some sort
of peace deal.
"I never said that I'm going
to speed things up in working
toward an agreement, as a result
of the elections," Barak said in a
speech to Israeli journalists in
Tel Aviv.
"I also said we won't reach an
agreement close to election time
that would be different from
one reached without elections,"
Barak continued.
