# Gore continues battle in supreme courts
## 
### 
Al (lore's lawyers battled for bis political sur
vival in the Florida and U.S. supreme courts
yesterday, pleading against delaying fresh vote
recounts "even one day" as a half-million ballots
sped In rental truck to Tallahassee. GOP law
makers jockeyed in the state capital to award
the presidency to George W. Bush in case the
judges wouldn't.
"When the counting stops, we want to be
prepared to lead this nation,' Bush said in
Texas between transition meetings with retired
Gen. Colin Powell — the star of his Cabinet-in
the-making. ()fficials said the meeting cement
ed Powell's position as secretary of state in a
presumptive Bush administration.
In Florida, the G()P-dominated state Legisla
ture drew a step closet to appointing us own slate
of presidential elec tors .is a committee urged
leaders to call a special session. Democ rats called
ili.u ".i bra/en power play," while they worked
elsewhere to keep (lore in the game.
Bush, whose brother is governor oft he state,
raised no objection to the Legislature's actions,
and his lawyers defended the lawmakers' right
to name a GOP slate. "It's time to get some li
nalii\Bush said in an appeanuice with Powell
.it his ('rawford, Texas, ranch.
Hundreds of miles away in Florida, Lt. Jim
Kersev's squad car headed up the ballot
brigade a> ii passed a handmade sign reading
"No chad /one."
"()h mv God." he s;iid.The whole world is
watching."
And what sights to see: Lawmakers cussed
and fumed in a legislative committee room; the
two could-be presidents plotted their transi
tions to power; legal briefs ricocheted between
the nation's courts; and the banana-yellow
rental truck — swarmed by police and media
vehicles on Ronald Reagan Turnpike — car
ried contested ballots to Circuit Judge N.
Sanders Sauls' court.
The recount convoy was captured by TV
cameras in helicopters, giving Americans a
birds-eye view all the way from Palm Beach to
Tallahassee.
Sauls could need the ballots if he sides with
Gore alter a hearing Saturdav on the merits of re
counts in three comities. I he \ ice president is tr\ -
ing to overturn the ollicial results of Florida's elec
tion, which give Bush a r>37-vote lead and the 2.">
electoral votes needed t0( laim the White I louse.
Gore's advisers believe he needs a court vir
ion and a speedy reduction of Bush's lead to
keep public patience with .123-day standofl thai
the vice president said could linger until the

Electoral College meets Dec. IS.
His lawyers filed an urgent plea with the
Florida Supreme Court asking the seven jus
tices, all with Democratic lies, to start hand
counting ballots while Sauls decides whether
the recounts could be added to Gore's totals.
"There is no reason to delay counting ballots
even one day.the brief read.
Summing up (lore's urgency, both legalh
and politically, his lawyers told the court:
"We're getting dose to the end."
The vice president's allies were just as em
phatic about a Florida legislative committee's
recommendation that a special session be c alled
to choose a slate of electors, presumably Bush
supporters.
"What the hell is going 011 here?" Senate Demo
cratic leader Tom Rossin asked in frustration.
Bush's brother, Tlorida Gov. Jel) Bush, said
lawmakers maviieed to intercede if the results
are still uncertain Dec. 12. the da\ states must

choose their electors. "( Clearly, the I .S. (Consti
tution delegates the authority■ of the selection ol
the electors to the Legislature," he said." I hat is
as clear as can be."
Not so, said Gore's lawyers.
They filed papers with the U.S. Supreme
(Court arguing that the Legislature would be on
shaky ground il ii appointed its own slate. Both
sides were submitting briefs in advance of
fodav's Supreme (Court oral arguments in
Washington.
(lore's running mate, Joseph 1 .ieberman, ac -
cused Jeb Bush of helping bis brother with a
power grab.
"It threatens to put us into a constitutional
crisis," Lieberm.m said. Until now, onl\ Bush's
team bad talked of stakes so high in an etlort to
force Gore to concede. Democrats employed
(he heated rhetoric yesterday to portray Bush
as a politic al puppeteer pulling even available
string to maintain his minuscule lead.
