IM.I ] IN(»(AP) — China and tlie Unit
ed Slates tentatively agreed yesterday to
more exchanges between their militaries,
helping bring a semblance of stability to
often rocky ties between the distrustful
delense establishments.
Iwo days of talks between U.S. Under
secretary <>l Defense Walter Slocombe
and .» raft of Chinese generals exhibited

the wavering dynamics that now charac
terize overall relations. China's pledge last
week not to help Pakistan, Iran and oth
ers build nuclear-capable missiles bright
ened the atmosphere, Slocombe said.
At the same time, a recent (Chinese de
fense policy paper — discussed in the
talks — directly and indirecth singled out
the United States and its military alliances

in the region as a threat to C ihina.
Slocombe said he told the ( hinese sii( h
remarks are "unhelpful."
lie later told reporters: "There's no
question that the I nited States and China
have real differences about issues, and that
some of those are quite important differ
ences. There's a difference between that
and regarding each other as enemies."
He told the Chinese that U.S. military
alliances with Japan, South Korea, Aus
tralia and others provide the region with
stability for economic growth.
Still Slocombe said lus meetings with
Gen. Chi Haotian, the defense minister,
(ien. Xiong Guangkai, deputy chief ol the
Chinese military's general staff, and oth
ers produced "tangible results."
Both sides mapped out plans, subject to
final approval, for more high-level visits
between their militaries next year, (China's
participation in international defense lo
rums and possible discussions on the mili
tary's role in disaster relief, Slocombe said.
" They're very modest and gradual
steps. The military-to-military relation
ship is clearlv going to grow, if at all, grad
ually," Slocombe said. China also gave a
positive but limited review of the talks. For
eign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue
said "the consultations have increased un
derstanding and trust."
The sober assessments underscored
how realistic both governments are about
military cooperation after years of fitful
ties. Relations opened in the 1980s were
stopped after China crushed the Tianan
men Square democracy demonstrations
in 1989. They began a slow crawl back
three years ago but were scuttled bv the
U.S. bombing of China's embassy in Yu
goslavia in May 1999.
In patching up differences, both sides
have tried to l<>cus on areas of agreement
and lessen the chances for conflict. In his
meetings, Slocombe said they touched on
both — discussing ways to support better
relations between the Koreas and diller
ences over Taiwan and proposed U.S.
anti-missile defenses.


U.S. Undersecretary of Defense Walter Slocombe speaks in front of a Chinese flag during
a news conference in Beijing yesterday. Slocombe arrived on Wednesday leading a U.S.
delegation to conduct the fourth around of Defence Consultative Talks with the Chinese Peo
ple's Liberation Army. The two sides discussed the program of military to military exchanges
proposed for next year.
