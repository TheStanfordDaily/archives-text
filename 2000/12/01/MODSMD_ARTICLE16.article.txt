# U.N. agency appeals for more food donations
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.N.
World Food Program is seeking more
than 800,000 tons of food to feed 8 mil
lion North Koreans and compensate for
crop shortfalls caused by droughts and
typhoons, the organization said yester
day.
A crop and tbod assessment by the
WFP and the Food and Agriculture ()r
-gani/ation found that North Korea's rice
production was down 'VI percent this
year and that corn output fell 235,000
tons from 1999.
"The country will need to import 1.87
million tons of cereal between November
2000 and (Jctober 2001 to cover the gap
between what it has and what it needs to
leed its 22 million people," according to
a WFP update of the situation in North
Korea.
()ther U.N. agencies issued a simulta
neous worldwide appeal lor $08 million
in nonemergency aid for North Korea
projects in such areas as water purifica
tion and health.
The "cycle of severe hunger" will con
tinue in North Korea unless problems
such as water contamination are dealt
with, said Abigail Spring, a WFP
spokeswoman. A majority of North Ko
reans drink fouled water, she said.
The United States has been bv far the
most generous contributor to WFP ap
peals to help North Korea, providing 07
percent of the total in response to a series
of requests since 1995, Spring said. An
other major contributor is South Korea.
A State Department official said the
United States is aware of the new WFP
request and is studying it.
The Clinton administration says its
donations to North Korea over the years
answered WFP requests and were unre
lated to political considerations.

In general, however, the United
States has responded more quickh and
more generously to WIT appeals for
North Korea than it has for other conn
tries, reflecting the importance the ad
ministration attaches to improving rela
tions with Pyongyang.
Andrew Natsios, a Bush administra
tion disaster relief official who has stud
ied North Korea's food problems, said
the Clinton administration withheld
food aid during 1990-97 for political rea
sons.
During that period, 2.5 million North
Koreans died of starvation, said Natsios.
I le described as "total nonsense" admin
istration claims that food disbursements
were not linked to political goals.
Since 1995, the United States has pro
vided 1.2 million metric tons of food
worth $425 million to North Korea.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
visited North Korea in October in an at
tempt to obtain curbs on its missile pro
gram. President Clinton has said he may
go there before leaving office.
To ensure the food reaches its intend
ed recipients, the W IT lias 4S officials
monitoring food distribution in 161
counties, Spring said. I he North has de
clared 50 counties oil limits for securitv
reasons, she said.
WFP access to the interior of the coun
try has increased sharply in recent years.
The less restrictive environment was re
flected in recent days with the visit of Rep.
Tony Hall, D-Ohio, who traveled to the
eastern industrial town of Chongjin as
well as rural areas hard hit by years of bad
weather and economic mismanagement.
Famine prevailed in much of North
Korea in the mid-19905, and drought
has returned this year after good grow
ing seasons in 1998-1999.
