## The
						Stanford daily With finals looming, students need a real Dead Week 
### 
Published Since 1891

AHHH . . . THE ARRIVAL of Dead
Week. Finally, you can take a break
from classes and spend day and night
poring over your books. And after a
peaceful week of studying while the entire Uni
versitv stops to encourage its students in aca
demic endeavors, you calmly take your finals
and score all As.
()ops, wrong university. You must be dream
ing of some school over on the East Coast,
rhafs right, you are at good old Stanford,
where Dead Week ( or the myth of it, at least)
starts next week.
Instead of a break from c lasses, Stanford stu
dents c an look forward to a stress-filled week of
c lasses and assignments right up to finals. Al
though. in theory, we are supposed to observe
the indulgences of "Dead Week" during there-

named "End-Quarter Period," all Stanford stu
dents seem to en joy is the Primordial Scream at
midnight.
Equally challenging schools such as Harvard
and Vale give their students a full, week-long
break from classes. Students at these schools
enjoy a "reading" period during which they
may concentrate exclusively on preparing for
finals.
We propose a similar schedule for Stanford.
We need to substitute a week of teaching fora
week of exclusive study time, or we need to
make the quarter a week longer to provide fora
preparatory pre-exam period.
The current Stanford policy for the "End-
Quarter Period" undercuts the whole notion of
preparation, ("lasses continue on their normal
schedules. Homework assignments and quizzes

are allowed as "routine parts of the instruction
process." The only clear academic restriction is
that an assignment cannot be given during End-
Quarter Period and be due that same week. But
that concession is easily overcome through the
provision that assignments given with "reason
able notice" are perfectly permissible.
As a result of these policies, students are rush
ing straight from lectures to exams, final papers
to finals, assignment deadlines to time-pres
sured tests without a chance to take a breath.
What is the aim of this setup? This ridicu
lously challenging arrangement is not con
ducive to academic excellence. It's a recipe for
breakdown.
Instead, Stanford should actively create a
study period in which class, work and activities
are halted. This is the best way to encourage

true learning and not rushed cramming in the
hectic pursuit of an A.
Professors should be able to plan accordingly
for such a study period. Instead of trying to fin
ish lectures a day before exams start, they can
expect their students to take the week before
exams to synthesize and absorb the ideas and in
formation that have been presented during the
quarter.
The strictest restrictions in the Stanford poli
cy focus on the elimination of social and ex
tracurricular activities, but because no atmo
sphere of sanctuary is created, events and meet
ings still go on, causing more distraction from
the goal of studying. Furthermore, professors
and TAs, along with students, are rushed into a
week of lecture, exam review and grading that
benefits no one.
