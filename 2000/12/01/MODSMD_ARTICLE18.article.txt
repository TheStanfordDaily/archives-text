OUR FREEDOM!" I
-JL. swear to God, I heard
someone streaming that yesterday. He
had "Bush-Cheney painted on his chest
<md he was riding a large white horse
down El ( amino, carrying a bloody
sword. No sooner had he yelled this than
lie was picked oil In (lore's archers, who
were hiding up in the trees.
Ii occurred to me as I watched the
Democratic guerrillas loot the Republican

corpse that the election
debate had become an
all-out partisan war,
transcending the nar
row confines of rational
thought.
Katherine Harris
certified the election re
sults in Florida on Sun
da\ First she read some
big numbers out loud.

(-e< >rge \V. Hush's number was larger than
Al (lore's number.
I lien, wuh absurdly large marker and
flourish, she signed her name to some
lanc\ pieces of paper. She gave the pieces
ol paper to two old men, seated on both
sides ol her. and had them sign it with the
same gargantuan writing device.
I ,asil\. she repeated for the c ameras the
number of electoral votes that Bush would
be getting, which was 25.
And that was it. Bush declared victory
and slid he was starting his transition. The
< able news stations talked about the certifi
cation as if it might have meant some reso
lution to this disputed election. Dick Ch
eney started doing jumping jacks to test
out his new heart. It almost seemed like
something signific ant had happened.
But then I remembered that Katherine
I lams was a dedicated, partisan Bush sup
porter who had been using her power in
his favor ever since Nov. 7. She tried to
block the manual recounts but was then
overruled b\ the Florida Supreme Court.
She tried to certify the vote before the
recounts were done. And, in a final stroke
of politic al flair, she ignored the results of
the Palm Beach County recount and the
thousands of man-hours that had gone
into it.
I honesth couldn't have been less im
pressed with the authenticity and com
pleteness of the Florida count had Jeb
Bush, Bob Dole, Rush Limbaugh, Trent
Lott, Newt Gingrich, Nancy Reagan and
the ghost of Richard Nixon's clog joined
112 fan is in signing the papers with the same
enormous marker.

This isn't about votes. The margin is sta
tistically meaningless, because the swings
in both manual and machine recounts
were higher than 537. There is no way,
given Florida's present ballot system, to
count accurately enough to make 537 votes
significant. And we know that there were
Gore votes found in Miami-Dade and Palm
Beach that were completely ignored in the
certified total.
Nor is this about the issues. Bush and
Gore are not speaking about their posi
tions on environmental protection or racial
profiling or tax cuts for the extremely
wealthy. Neither are our congressmen or
Senators. For that matter, neither are we.
It's all about the recount, the bias, the
election, the contest, the fight.
It's all about power. This is politics un
dressed: how to get, keep and use existing
power to help yourself, friends and allies
ascend to high political office. People ex
press ideas and expect friends and sup
porters to agree. It doesn't matter what
those ideas are. You've got to be loyal to
your team. Power is too important for
objectivity.
Bush wants to move on, to heal the
country. I le says that the recount process is
unjust. ()f course, he's only saying that be
cause he fears that if all the votes were
counted then he would lose. That's why
the Bush team has opposed the recounts
from day one.
Gore wants to count every vote, to keep
the sanctity of democracy alive. Of course,
he's only saying that because he thinks that
he would win if the recounts were allowed
to proceed.
I agree with Gore. I want to keep the
sanctity of our democracy alive, to count
every vote.
But I have no choice but to resign my
self to the conclusion that I would think dif
ferently if the situation were reversed. I'm
a Gore supporter. Guilty as charged.
Similarly, Katherine Harris agrees with
Bush. She wants to move on. She wants to
heal the country. She thinks that this has
gone on long enough. But she, too, would
think differently if the situation were re
versed. She's a Bush supporter, and he's
got a chance at the highest office in the
United States. Much too important for
objectivity.
In a battle this big, the worst crime is to
claim objectivity, to claim the moral high
ground. To appeal to common sense when
the community itself is divided along parti
san lines is pure lunacy.
