# HAAS Center offers summer fellowships
## 
### CAROLYN LIU 
For students living hectic, activity
laden lives, the Haas Center for Public
Service's flexible community service pro
grams have enabled them to include vol
unteer work in their schedules.
But once classes are over, clubs and
sports teams finish up their seasons and
summer settles in, students can look to the
1 laas Center for continued service oppor
tunities. The center currently offers a va
riety of summer fellowships, targeted to
ward undergraduates, that award
amounts ranging from $2,500 to $5,000.
Applications are now available for these
programs.
According to Director of Service Learn
ing Jackie Schmidt-Posner, there are
three types of fellowships: self-designed
fellowships in which students propose
their own programs, placement fellow
ships that allow for community work with
more guidance and fellowships that com
bine elements of the two.
"The Public Service Summer Fellows
have an idea of what they want to do,"
Schmidt-Posner said. They have to have
approval from a community partner who
buys into their program. The fellowship is
a way to get their idea funded."
The Public Service Summer Fellow
ship, which is funded by William and Reva
Tooley, the H. Michael Stevens family and
an anonymous donor in honor of former
University President Donald Kennedy,
supports students in developing pro
grams that address specific community
needs. Each fellow can receive up to
$3,0()() to implement projects dealing with
a wide variety of issues, including home
lessness, domestic violence and health
care. Last summer's programs ranged
from providing art therapy and recre

ation for children to teaching computer
courses to exiled Tibetans.
Junior Wei Wei, a Public Service Sum
mer Fellow for both 1999 and 2000, creat
ed programs concerning environmental
activism, animal welfare and conservation
in Beijing.

for local students and the general public

who visited the [Beijing Aquari
um] on marine mammals and en
vironmental conservation," he
said. "The second year 1 did a
high school environmental con
servation leadership training
program, where 1 worked with
about 40 kids. I intensively
trained them to work with ani
mals, to give them an idea of how
to follow a career path in working
with animals."
At the same time, Wei worked
as an animal trainer and per
formed in daily shows at the
aquarium. His prior experience
with animal rescues in China led
him to create a program that ed
ucates children about animals
and the environment.

"The kids were really fabulous
both years." Wei said. "But the
second year 1 had to work with
animals and kids at the same
time, and kids are curious. Some
times they'd put their hands in
the dolphin's mouth."
Although the fellowship pro
vided for only two summers of
work, Wei's project continues in
Clhina despite his absence. "Ifyou
establish a program really well, it
will have a continuing impact on
the community," he said. "I
taught other people at the aquar
ium to do the presentations, and
it's still being carried on now."
file sustainabiiity of these fel
lowship programs also concerned
sophomore Michelle Leung, a
2000 Urban Summer Fellow.
Under the Urban Summer Fel
lowship. launched last year by the
1 laas Center and the Program on
Urban Studies, students receive

$2,500 for public service in the
areas of architecture, community
organizations or urban planning.
Leung was placed into an es
tablished program with the Fn
terprise Foundation's Youth
Consortium in Fast Palo Alto.
"[The Enterprise Foundation]
is a nationwide organi/ation, and
the basic goal is to provide people
with low-income housing options
and job placement. In the Fast
Palo Alto chapter, there was a
need to develop a youth compo
nent," she said. "There are lots of
amazing youth services there, but
they often don't have the means
to communicate with each other,
and what we try to do is link all
those groups."
Leung helped publish a
monthly newsletter to enable bet
ter coordination of youth service
groups such as the Boys' and
Girls' Club, the Fast Palo Alto ju

nior Golf program and Little
League. "A lot of the programs
aren't as effective as they could be
for the littlest reasons, just be
cause they plan all their events on
the same day, or because they
don't know about all the groups
to reach out to," Leung said.
While Leung found working
with young people fulfilling, she
did have hurdles to overcome.
"One of my main obstacles was
making sure the project would be
sustainable. As much as I would
love to do my work as completely
as ihis past summer, there just isn't
the time," she said. "I struggle not
to be seen as a Stanford student
who comes in, does my good deed,
and then leaves. The newsletter's
still going out. but there's a lot of
changeover in the stall."
Applications are now available
for all summer fellowships,
which are offered in a wide array

of areas including law, business,
gay and lesbian activism and
philanthropic foundations.
While the deadlines for most are
late January and early February,
Schmidt-Posner encourages stu
dents to begin the process as
soon as possible.
"[Our fellowship staff] can
provide help to put together a
better application and talk about
which fellowship would be best
for the students' ideas," she said.
Senior Lisa Rosenbaum, a 1999
Public Service Fellow, agrees.
"It was the first time I'd writ
ten a grant proposal, and it's kind
of challenging. If you've never
written one before, you should
seek help," she said.
The application process for
the fellowships includes prepar
ing personal statements and ob
taining recommendation letters.
For the self-designed fellowships

such as the Public Service Fellow
ship and Urban Summer Fellow
ship, an action plan outlining the
student's proposed program and
endorsement by a community or
ganization are also required.
"The summer fellowships real
ly allow students to spend two or
three months focused in a full
time way on an area ol their in
terest," Schmidt-Posner said. Iti
some cases, while these aren't re
search fellowships per se, stu
dents use the opportunity to do
some work on their senior thesis."
Schmidt-Posner also pointed
to both long- and short-term ben
efits offered by the fellowships.
"Students can do some career ex
ploration and gain experience
that can not only be useful when
they graduate, but also in the
courses they take here. It can
make what they learn here more
meaningful."

Leung helped publish a
monthly newsletter to enable bet
ter coordination of youth service
groups such as the Boys' and
Girls' Club, the Fast Palo Alto ju

nior Golf program and Little
League. "A lot of the programs
aren't as effective as they could be
for the littlest reasons, just be
cause they plan all their events on
the same day, or because they
don't know about all the groups
to reach out to," Leung said.
While Leung found working
with young people fulfilling, she
did have hurdles to overcome.
"One of my main obstacles was
making sure the project would be
sustainable. As much as I would
love to do my work as completely
as ihis past summer, there just isn't
the time," she said. "I struggle not
to be seen as a Stanford student
who comes in, does my good deed,
and then leaves. The newsletter's
still going out. but there's a lot of
changeover in the stall."
Applications are now available
for all summer fellowships,
which are offered in a wide array

of areas including law, business,
gay and lesbian activism and
philanthropic foundations.
While the deadlines for most are
late January and early February,
Schmidt-Posner encourages stu
dents to begin the process as
soon as possible.
"[Our fellowship staff] can
provide help to put together a
better application and talk about
which fellowship would be best
for the students' ideas," she said.
Senior Lisa Rosenbaum, a 1999
Public Service Fellow, agrees.
"It was the first time I'd writ
ten a grant proposal, and it's kind
of challenging. If you've never
written one before, you should
seek help," she said.
The application process for
the fellowships includes prepar
ing personal statements and ob
taining recommendation letters.
For the self-designed fellowships

such as the Public Service Fellow
ship and Urban Summer Fellow
ship, an action plan outlining the
student's proposed program and
endorsement by a community or
ganization are also required.
"The summer fellowships real
ly allow students to spend two or
three months focused in a full
time way on an area ol their in
terest," Schmidt-Posner said. Iti
some cases, while these aren't re
search fellowships per se, stu
dents use the opportunity to do
some work on their senior thesis."
Schmidt-Posner also pointed
to both long- and short-term ben
efits offered by the fellowships.
"Students can do some career ex
ploration and gain experience
that can not only be useful when
they graduate, but also in the
courses they take here. It can
make what they learn here more
meaningful."
For students living hectic, activity
laden lives, the Haas Center for Public
Service's flexible community service pro
grams have enabled them to include vol
unteer work in their schedules.
But once classes are over, clubs and
sports teams finish up their seasons and
summer settles in, students can look to the
1 laas Center for continued service oppor
tunities. The center currently offers a va
riety of summer fellowships, targeted to
ward undergraduates, that award
amounts ranging from $2,500 to $5,000.
Applications are now available for these
programs.
According to Director of Service Learn
ing Jackie Schmidt-Posner, there are
three types of fellowships: self-designed
fellowships in which students propose
their own programs, placement fellow
ships that allow for community work with
more guidance and fellowships that com
bine elements of the two.
"The Public Service Summer Fellows
have an idea of what they want to do,"
Schmidt-Posner said. They have to have
approval from a community partner who
buys into their program. The fellowship is
a way to get their idea funded."
The Public Service Summer Fellow
ship, which is funded by William and Reva
Tooley, the H. Michael Stevens family and
an anonymous donor in honor of former
University President Donald Kennedy,
supports students in developing pro
grams that address specific community
needs. Each fellow can receive up to
$3,0()() to implement projects dealing with
a wide variety of issues, including home
lessness, domestic violence and health
care. Last summer's programs ranged
from providing art therapy and recre

ation for children to teaching computer
courses to exiled Tibetans.

who visited the [Beijing Aquari
um] on marine mammals and en
vironmental conservation," he
said. "The second year 1 did a
high school environmental con
servation leadership training
program, where 1 worked with
about 40 kids. I intensively
trained them to work with ani
mals, to give them an idea of how
to follow a career path in working
with animals."
At the same time, Wei worked
as an animal trainer and per
formed in daily shows at the
aquarium. His prior experience
with animal rescues in China led
him to create a program that ed
ucates children about animals
and the environment.

"The kids were really fabulous
both years." Wei said. "But the
second year 1 had to work with
animals and kids at the same
time, and kids are curious. Some
times they'd put their hands in
the dolphin's mouth."
Although the fellowship pro
vided for only two summers of
work, Wei's project continues in
Clhina despite his absence. "Ifyou
establish a program really well, it
will have a continuing impact on
the community," he said. "I
taught other people at the aquar
ium to do the presentations, and
it's still being carried on now."

sophomore Michelle Leung, a
2000 Urban Summer Fellow.
Under the Urban Summer Fel
lowship. launched last year by the
1 laas Center and the Program on
Urban Studies, students receive

$2,500 for public service in the
areas of architecture, community
organizations or urban planning.
Leung was placed into an es
tablished program with the Fn
terprise Foundation's Youth
Consortium in Fast Palo Alto.
"[The Enterprise Foundation]
is a nationwide organi/ation, and
the basic goal is to provide people
with low-income housing options
and job placement. In the Fast
Palo Alto chapter, there was a
need to develop a youth compo
nent," she said. "There are lots of
amazing youth services there, but
they often don't have the means
to communicate with each other,
and what we try to do is link all
those groups."
