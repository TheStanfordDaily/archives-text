### CAROLYN LIU 
For students living hectic, activity
laden lives, the Haas Center for Public
Service's flexible community service pro
grams have enabled them to include vol
unteer work in their schedules.
But once classes are over, clubs and
sports teams finish up their seasons and
summer settles in, students can look to the
1 laas Center for continued service oppor
tunities. The center currently offers a va
riety of summer fellowships, targeted to
ward undergraduates, that award
amounts ranging from $2,500 to $5,000.
Applications are now available for these
programs.
According to Director of Service Learn
ing Jackie Schmidt-Posner, there are
three types of fellowships: self-designed
fellowships in which students propose
their own programs, placement fellow
ships that allow for community work with
more guidance and fellowships that com
bine elements of the two.
"The Public Service Summer Fellows
have an idea of what they want to do,"
Schmidt-Posner said. They have to have
approval from a community partner who
buys into their program. The fellowship is
a way to get their idea funded."
The Public Service Summer Fellow
ship, which is funded by William and Reva
Tooley, the H. Michael Stevens family and
an anonymous donor in honor of former
University President Donald Kennedy,
supports students in developing pro
grams that address specific community
needs. Each fellow can receive up to
$3,0()() to implement projects dealing with
a wide variety of issues, including home
lessness, domestic violence and health
care. Last summer's programs ranged
from providing art therapy and recre

ation for children to teaching computer
courses to exiled Tibetans.
