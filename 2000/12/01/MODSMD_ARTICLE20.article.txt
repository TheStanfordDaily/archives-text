Stanford resident responds to ad
The ad in Monday's Daily by the Stan
ford Israel Alliance and The Israeli Stu
dent Organization, with its inflammatory
quotes by Palestinians, proved only that in
this tragic conflict there are extremists on
both sides.
It would be just as easy to quote Israelis
who express hatred of Palestinians, such as
former Chief of Staff Rafael Eitan, who
said they should be made to feel "like
drugged cockroaches in a bottle," or for
mer Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir who,
in a nationally televised speech in 1989,
called Palestinians "brutal, wild, alien in
vaders in the land of Israel that belongs to
the people of Israel and only to them."
More recently, former Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu quoted in the Nov.
24, 1990 issue of Yedoit Aharonet as say
ing, after the killings in Beijing's Tienan
men Square, that "Israel should have
taken advantage of the suppression of
demonstrations in China, while the
world's attention was focused on these
events, and should have carried out mass
deportations of Arabs from the
territories."
Last August, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, the
spiritual leader of the Knesset's third
largest party, referred to Palestinians as
"snakes and serpents."
The most misleading part of Monday's
ad quoted Prime Minister Ehud Barak as
saying, "We will leave no stone unturned

in our attempt to achieve peace and secu
rity with our Palestinian neighbors." In
fact, Barak has not furthered the peace
process but undermined it.
He expanded settlements in the occu
pied territories at an even greater rate
tthan did his Likud party predecessor Ne
tanyahu and refused to dismantle the
more than 30 unauthorized settlements
put up by extremist settlers just before he
took office. Meanwhile his government
continued to demolish Palestinian homes
and seize Palestinian land for the huge
highway network that connects the settle
ments with Jerusalem and has turned
Palestianian communities into isolated
blots on the map.
The "statehood" Barak offered the
Palestinians consisted of a collection of
these separate enclaves, each one of them
surrounded by Israeli territory guarded
by Israeli soldiers. Finally, the shallowness
of his offer to the Palestinians of adminis
trative authority, rather than sovereignty,
over the Muslim holy places in East
Jerusalem was shown up when Ariel
Sharon barged on to the site last Septem
ber accompanied by a thousand soldiers.
I am sure the sponsors of the ad are sin
cere in saying, "We support peace," but
any lasting peace between Israel and the
Palestinians must be a just one.
On Nov. 28, United Nations Human
Rights Commissioner Mary Robinson re
ported that life for Palestinians had been
one of "grinding, petty humiliations, dis

criminations and inequalities" that are "ul
timately dehumanizing." Obviously, this
situation must end if the two sides are to
live together in peace.
Any agreement from now on must rec
ognize the right of the Palestinians to
equality and dignity in a state of their own,
on contiguous territory and with control
over their own borders. The security of
both Palestinians and Israel ultimately de
pends, as it always has, on their coexis
tence as equals, not as occupier and
captive.
