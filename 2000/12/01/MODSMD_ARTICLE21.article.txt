cer team is now onl\ one game awav from the Final
Font . One game that could be its toughest all sea
son.
l'omorrow night, the Cardinal's No. 1 defense,
which has shutout 1 0 teams and given up only eight
goals this year, will look to stop the top-ranked of
fense <>l Southern Methodist I 11 i\ersil\ at New
Maloney Field at 7:30 p.m.
Stanford (IN-2-1) will be in search of its second
trip to the semifinals in three years. I he sixth-seed

"SMI is going to be one ol the best teams we play
ihis year," said senior midfielder Derek Shanahan.
"The\ have had a great year, but once the game
starts, what the team has done up to this point in the
vear doesn't mean all that much. We're going to
prepare as best we possibly can, but it will be a good
test."

The Mustangs bring a wealth of experience to
the game. This is SMU's seventh consecutive show
ing in the NCAA Tournament and the team's 16th
appearance in the past 17 seasons. Stanford will
have its hands full, to say the least.

Ryan Nelsen. "We know this is going to be another
step up from w hat we have faced in the tournament
so far. We have to be totally focused on the job at

scoring a string of 10 unanswered goals. But to

"The last two games have not been easy," said se
nior defender Chris Cores. "1 don't think that there
are any easy games in the NCAA tournament. We
have gotten two good results in our first two games.

Fhroughout the year the Cardinal has proven
that it can keep its focus. Gores feels that is proof
enough that the first- and second-round wins will
not effect the team's performance tomorrow night.
