No. 22 Loyola Mar)mount, the No. 18 Cardi
nal squad (19-1 I) showed exactly what it was
talking about
Led In an impressive performance from
senior middle blocker Jennifer Detmer olfthe
bench, the Cardinal put awav LMU in three
games in Santa Barbara, 15-1 I, 1 5-0, 15-9.
Stanford laces No. 14 I C Santa Barbara
(24-7) tonight in the second round while the
Lions finish their season at 20-9.

Detmer, who saw limited action in the Car
dinal's last four regular season matches, post
ed seven kills while hitting at a .455 clip. She
also tallied a match-high seven blocks.
"1 just wanted to contribute on the court,"
Detmer said. "I feel like 1 just went out and
did my job."
Stanford's game plan for the match fo
cused on shutting down LMU outside hitter
Sarah McFarland, who leads the nation in
kills. I he Cardinal did just that, forcing Mc-
Farland into 14 hitting errors and a negative
hitting percentage for the match.
"We definitely wanted to hold down Mc-
Farland tonight," said interim head coach
Denise Corlett. "Once our blocking got into
the game we were able to take their big hitter
out, and we played one of our best matches of
the year."
