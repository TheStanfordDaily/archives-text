"As far as I'm concerned.''
.aid VanDerveer, "they play like
seniors. The best thing is that
they'll be here for four years.''
While the freshman duo has
been solid, it is some of Stan
ford's more experienced players
who have struggled out of the
gate. Senior center Carolyn
Moos has looked shaky coming
off the bench. While her outside
shots are dropping in, her confi
dence in the post seems lacking.
"We start what we think will
be our best defensive line-up."
said VanDerveer. "Some teams

Junior Lauren St. CHair, who led the l'a
(ifi< 10 ('.onlerence in three point shooting
percentage last season, is having problems
of her own. St. Clair, a starting wing for

ihe Cardinal, hasn'i posted a single point
alter putting up IS in the team's overtime
win over St. Joseph's. But it isn't like St.
Clair to stay silent for long. II she can get
into her shooting groove, St. Clair could
put up big numbers against the Minute
women.
Still, Moos and St. (Hair do not make or
break the team. IT the Cardinal utilizes its
depth to its lull potential and continues to
play cohesively, the two won't need to be at
the top of their games lor Stanford to
shoot down the Minutewomen Sunday.
