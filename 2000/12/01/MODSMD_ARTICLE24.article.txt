### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Many, many years ago, be
fore bringing Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships. No.l
seeds ancl lolly rankings lo
Stanford basketball, Mike
Montgomery was a Long
Beach State filer. But since he
left in 19f>N with his bachelor's
degree, the relationship
doesn't appear to have with
stood the test of time.
"I've been gone so long, I
don't think Long Beach still
claims me, to be honest with
von," the Stanford basketball
head coach joked at a press

conference fnesdav. "They
were probabh embarrassed
about me graduating from
there fora long time, but it'll
be fun."
I omorrow at 7:30 pviir,
Montgomery will return to
"The Beach" for the first time
as a head coach, with his No. 4
Cardinal bringing its ">-()
record down to Southern Cali
fornia fora non-conference
matchup.
The game will also be a
homecoming of sorts for se

whose lather, Glenn, attended Long
Beach State and still works there as the in
tramural supervisor.
"He's [in] the same situation," Mont
gomery said. "His dad played there. He
grew up and played in the Long Beach
school system. [But] again, the purpose of
the game is not necessarily lor anybody's
homecoming. Long Beach has had a good
basketball history."
The 49ers (.'*-2) won the Big West Con
ference Western Division title last year with
a 15-1 conference record and took Califor
nia to the end of a National Invitational
1 ournament first-round game last year be
fore losing, 70-66. | ust last week at the Big
Island Invitational in Hawaii, Long Beach
State defeated San Francisco and Tulanc,
with a competitive loss to Oregon State in
between.
In other wot ds, don't expect tomorrow's
game to be anything like the Cardinal's
easy win over future Big West member I'( -
Riverside on Wednesday. Long Beach pos
sesses a fair amount of talent to throw at
Montgomery and his squad.
Forty-niner senior small forward Lemi
Williams raised more than a few eyebrows
with his play in Hawaii, averaging 17.7
points on the island and sinking the
game-winning shot against USF with four
seconds left on the clock. He's joined in
the frontcourt by UCLA transfer Travis
Reed, who sat out last season per NCAA
regulations. Reed is averaging 1 1 points
and seven rebounds per game at the cen
ter spot.
I lie 49ers' most dangerous player,

though, may be senior shooting guard
Ramel Lloyd, a former Syracuse player
whom several basketball publications
anointed the pre-season Big West Player of
the Year. Lloyd, who is averaging 19 points
per game, could be a handful for sopho
more guard Casey Jacobsen to defend.
The Cardinal defense has been up to
the task through the season's first five
games, but Montgomery thinks there i>
room for improvement.
"We're not near where we need to be,'
he said. "[The veteran kids] know when t<
tag off flares, and when to tag of!doubles
how to get off and toward the ball. We just
need to get some of our younger player?
brought along with the defensive concept
That's the chore right now."
Having sophomore center Curtis Bor
chardt in the middle would go a long wav
towards keeping the clamps on the 49ers
offense, but liis status is still up in the ait
after suffering a chipped bone in his lefi
pinky toe earlier in the week. A decision 01
his status seems likely to come at game time
Meanwhile, redshirt freshman powet
forward Justin Davis is still out with the
same abdominal pull that has kept him
from making his Stanford debut.
"We've got two weeks off after Satur
day," Montgomery said. "When I say off.
we don't have a game for two weeks. We're
hoping to get him to practice in that period
of time."
Saturday's game will be played at The
Pyramid, Long Beach State's six-year-old
arena that is, interestingly, one of only
three true pyramidal structures in the
United States (the others being the MOM
Grand in Las Vegas and The Pyramid in
Memphis)/! he 18-story building measures
345 feet on each of its four cobalt-blue
sides, and seats about 5,000 fans.
