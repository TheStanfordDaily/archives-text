# No room for winter walk-ins
## Students returning from overseas programs may find themselves without on-campus housing 
### NINA CANN-WOODE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There are more students to house than Stanford
has room lor. Despite numerous adjustments made
to on-campus residences, many more students re
turning from overseas or other activities than usual
may still be left without a place to live winter quar
ter and others may be assigned to a local apartment
complex.
"This is the biggest housing crunch we've had
[in] the last live to 10 years, if not longer," said
Todd Benson, manager of Housing Assignment
Services. "[There] is always more of a demand dur
ing winter quarter than in fall or spring because of
students who return to campus alter being overseas
or in the Stanford in Washington program."
Two-hundred fifty students applied for winter
quarter housing this year but were not offered
spaces during the housing waiting-list round.
They will not be offered housing until the walk-in
round, which will take place at the beginning of
January.
()f these 250 students, 194 are "guaranteed," 43
have "intermediate" status and 17 are "unguaran
teed." Knrolling freshmen are guaranteed four
years of housing and enrolling transfers two or
three, depending on the number of transfer units
thev have upon entering Stanford.
Students with guaranteed years remaining who
either apply late or indicate on their housing appli
cation that iliey only want to be assigned to certain
residences are granted intermediate status.
"This means these students are no longer guar
anteed housing, but will be olfered housing if
spaces are still available after all guaranteed stu
dents are assigned," Benson clarified.
Students who have no guaranteed years remain-

rhere arc a few different rea

percent of students left unas

decided not to pm sue oil-campus
housing. For fall quarter of this

sharply to onh pen cut, mean

dents continue to seek, on-cani

I lie number of students who
drop out after I.ill quarter either
to graduate, live on their own off
campus or stop out, has also
dropped 40 percent from last
year.
Rob Person, a junior spending
fall quarter in Russia, hopes like

main other unassigned students
that he will have housing next
quarter.
I am not assigned for housing
yet, and am number 57 on the
walk-on list." said Person, who
drew 2,900 this vcar.
"I received a letter sent
through the [Oversea?* Studies
Program] to unassigned students
overseas and was less than reas
sured: While they certainly
weren't naive [or] even a l>ii blunt,
I didn't really feel reassured that
guaranteed meant 'guaran
teed,'" he said.

"I signed upon the wailing list

got the spectacular draw number
of 2,968," Chen said. "I, like 129
other girls, learned of m\ unas
signed Mains just last week. We all
received a letter detailing the
walk-on process lor winter-quar
ter housing, and from what I un
derstand, we are guaranteed

housing l>\ ilu- end of the first
week ol classes."
According to Benson, Chen's
assessment is true: All students

I lowever, "the number olavail
ahle extra spat es on campus is lim
ited because so many extra spaces
were ahead}' taken to meet the
housing needs of large entering
c lasses in 1997 and 1999," Benson
added. "In 1999 alone, approxi
mate!) 1,740 freshmen enrolled at
Stanford versus an expected en
rollment of 1 ,f>oo."

Sharon Creen, a local luxun
apartment complex, provides
more housing alternatives. Lo

cated very (lose to campus, stu
dents in this complex will be
housed two per bedroom (as in
a one-room double on campus)
in two and three-bedroom
apart ments.
But some students may still be
left without housing.
Su/v Fong, a junior studying
abroad in Spain, missed the dead
line lor winter-quarter housing
<tnd ma\ end up unhoused.
"From what I have heard from
Housing Assignment Services, I
am under the impression that I
have no other option but to find
oil-campus housing." Fong said.
"Mr. Benson has told me that nn
(I lances of getting housing during
walk-ons are very slim."
I Ins year's housing crunch lias
created some disagreeable odds
(or unguaranteed students.
"This is actual!) not something
new." Benson said. "It has been
laii l\ common in the past for all or
some unguaranteed students not
to be housed at the start of the
quarter, since we cannot oiler
them a spate until all guaranteed

and intermediate status individu
als are housed.'
The main difference between
tins year and previous years is that
it is "very likely." given the large
number of guaranteed students
who are unhoused, that Housing
Assignment Services will not even
be able to oiler spat es to many —
or any — intermediate-status stu
dents, explained Benson.
"The administration suppos
edly guarantees housing tor four
vears, yet a lew friends of mine
who did sign up before the dead
line are still unassigned," long
s.iid. "1 think it's absurd."
"I reali/e Housing is thinking
about using Sharon (ireen — the
so-called 'lu\iir\ apartments* —
bin I would not be pleased to be
off campus, no matter how luxuri
ous ii is." Person said. "First [ol
all], I don't have a car. And sec
ondh, part ol Stanford's greatness
is us campus life and community.
I wouldn't want to be separated
from this aspect of University life,
.is ii is what makes Stanl<>rd such a
great school.

"1 am simply crossing my lin
gers and hoping that by the end
of my lust week back, 1 will have
a place to live on campus," he
said.
Housing Assignment Services
explains the methods for calculat
ing and allotting housing are not
always predictable or static.
"When we lirst ran the housing
Draw last spring, we anticipated
that we would be roughly 30 to 35
spaces short at the beginning of
winter quarter," Benson said. "Al
though this was not an insignifi
cant number, it was one we fig
ured we would be able to manage
relatively easily.
"But there was noway we could
have anticipated that sudden —
and absolutely unprecedented —
drop in the waiting list attrition
rate from 50 percent to 3 percent.
Nor was there any way to antici
pate the 10 percent drop in the
number ol students deciding to
leave campus at the end ol au
tumn quarter. Both of these
events simply had not happened
before."
