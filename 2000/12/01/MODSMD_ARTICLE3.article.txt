# No room for winter walk-ins
## Students returning from overseas programs may find themselves without on-campus housing 
### NINA CANN-WOODE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There are more students to house than Stanford
has room lor. Despite numerous adjustments made
to on-campus residences, many more students re
turning from overseas or other activities than usual
may still be left without a place to live winter quar
ter and others may be assigned to a local apartment
complex.
"This is the biggest housing crunch we've had
[in] the last live to 10 years, if not longer," said
Todd Benson, manager of Housing Assignment
Services. "[There] is always more of a demand dur
ing winter quarter than in fall or spring because of
students who return to campus alter being overseas
or in the Stanford in Washington program."
Two-hundred fifty students applied for winter
quarter housing this year but were not offered
spaces during the housing waiting-list round.
They will not be offered housing until the walk-in
round, which will take place at the beginning of
January.
()f these 250 students, 194 are "guaranteed," 43
have "intermediate" status and 17 are "unguaran
teed." Knrolling freshmen are guaranteed four
years of housing and enrolling transfers two or
three, depending on the number of transfer units
thev have upon entering Stanford.
Students with guaranteed years remaining who
either apply late or indicate on their housing appli
cation that iliey only want to be assigned to certain
residences are granted intermediate status.
"This means these students are no longer guar
anteed housing, but will be olfered housing if
spaces are still available after all guaranteed stu
dents are assigned," Benson clarified.
Students who have no guaranteed years remain-

Students living in dormitories such as Roble Hall are the envy of many stu
dents returning from overseas, who are not sure if they will be accommo
dated in campus housing when they return.
