# University-childcare availability focus of Fac Sen meeting
## 
### MARK DOMINIK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A plan was unveiled at yesterday's Fac
ulty Senate meeting that would partially
alleviate the childcare crisis that Stanford
parents are currently facing.
A daycare center that can accommo
date approximately 110 full-time children
will open in Stanford West next fall, and
another center is scheduled to open in
2002 or 2003. A stipend package for fac
ulty and stall is also being considered in
order to make childcare more affordable.
In a survey of Stanford community
members that the Work Life Office pre
sented to the Senate, 71 percent of facul-

ty, 90 percent of staff and 76 percent of
graduate students felt that childcare has
an impact on recruitment and retention.
The flourishing of Silicon Valley has
not only created a problem in daycare af
fordability, it has also created a crisis of
availability.
"The centralized waiting list for the two
daycare centers on campus was 485-facul
ty, -staff and -students long last year. This
year, the list has grown to over 500," Sul
livan said.
The childcare situation has reached
crisis level at Stanford in recent years. The
cost of childcare in Santa Clara County
lias ballooned so high that one former
stall member is quoted in the report as

saying "... if childcare was more afford
able and on-site, 1 may have entertained
the idea of staying .it my job. I make 38k
per year. 11 I were to continue working
more than 75 percent of my salary would
be for child care. Why then, would I opt to
work?"
The situation is made worse because
"Palo Alto has no daycare openings, par
ticularly for infant-toddler care," she
added.
In other business, David Palumbo-Liu,
professor of comparative literature, pre
sented the (lommittee for Undergraduate
Admission and Financial Aid's annual re
port to the Senate. According to
Palumbo-Liu, the allbrdability of a Stan-

ford education to middle-class families re
mains a concern to the committee.
The committee also voiced concern
about Stanford's ability to attract quality
students 112 rom abroad in light of Yale's re
cent decision to go to a need-blind system
of admitting international students.
"We may be interested in re-evaluating
international student financial aid. We
are not need-blind lor international stu
dents, and th.it is a critical issue," said
Robin Mamlet, dean of admission and fi
nancial aid.
The Committee for Undergraduate
Admission and Financial Aid lias sched
uled extra meetings this year in order to
examine these issues in depth. Mamlet,

who is new to Stanford this year, will pre
sent a more thorough report to the Senate
in the spring after she has gone through a
complete admissions cycle at Stanford.
University President John Mennessy
also reported to the Senate about the on
going progress with the General Use Per
mit.
"We have a preliminary form of the
GUI' that was passed by the Board of Su
pervisors, and we are cautiously opti
mistic that we will be able to negotiate a
final form of the GUP," said I lennessv.
At the end of the meeting, Provost
John Etchemendy announced that Sulli
van was retiring from her position as di
rector of the Work Life Ollice.
