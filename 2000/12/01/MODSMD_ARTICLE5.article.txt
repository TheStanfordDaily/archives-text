# Fuzzy math

### NICHOLAS CHAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Interested in statistics but don't know if you
can do the math? For humanities students in
terested in fulfilling their Area 2 general educa
tion requirement, the Statistics Department is
in the process of creating a new class called Sta
tistics 30: "Statistics with Scenarios." The class
will be taught winter quarter by Statistics Prof.
Bradley Efron and Senior Lecturer Susan
Holmes.
Statistics 30 will cover a variety of statistics
topics including randomized clinical trials, sta
tistical significance and accuracy without going
into complex mathematical concepts.

"It's an attempt to get across the ideas that
are in statistics without exposing students to t he
difficulties of mathematical notations," Efron
said.
"This class is an attempt at an active-creative
approach to learning statistics. [It's] for creative
students with a slight allergy to cakulus and
numbers," Holmes said.
Because the ( lass is new, the professors are
currently in the process of writing the syllabus.
The class material is being researched from
books and similar classes at other schools. In ad
dition, both Efron and Holmes have several
years of teaching experience in the area of sta
tistics.
Efron has found many of his ideas for this

course In lecturing students of varying mathe
matical backgrounds. "I've noticed you can get
across some of the ideas without a lot of math,
so I've built up a little repertoire of lectures and
I work off of those," he said.
Computers will play a large role in Statistics
.SO. Students will have the chance to use com
puters for Web-based statistical simulations. As
an example, the course Web site includes an an
imation sequence where cartoon flowers grow
and butterflies fly. The animation then com
pares the high and low points of the butterfly's
flight.
"Even the most fuzzy of the fuzzies are good
