lis the Season to Recycle
Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house,
Lois of trash lay in heaps ready to be tossed out.
The packages were wrapped with barely a thought,
That recycled gift paper coulJ've been bought
Comics and newspapers, that went in the trash,
Could have wrapped holiday gifts in a flash.
Cardboard boxes were bound tor the landfill this winter,
They could've been recycled at a local drop-off center!
Greeting cards had been opened, then stuffed in trash bags
When they'd have made great postcards—or even gift tags!
Plenty of icicles and plastic hung on the tree
When pinecones and berries would look nice—naturally!
It was enough to make even old Santa shed a tear
"Another house th.it didn't recycle," he sighed, "Maybe next year!"
