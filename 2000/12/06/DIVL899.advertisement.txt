"There is substantial evidence which
suggests that God is growing a new soul
within us at this time in history. Jim Burklo
clearly perceives the nature of that new soul
and pens a marvelous book articulating
what will likely become the prominent spirit
of Christianity in the 21st century."

& Future of the Human Soul
