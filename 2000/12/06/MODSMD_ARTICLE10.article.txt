New law may give victims
right to prosecute gun
dealers
S\\ I k\\< IS( () (AP) — Victims ol firearm vio
lence in.i\ lie .il>l<- to sue 1111 dealers, makers and ini
porters in San Francisco, thanks to a new law passed by
lhe Board of Supervisors on Monday.
The gun makers, dealers and importers could be
held liable for "direct and consequential damages" of
injuries and deaths in San Francisco that result from
their firearms.
About 60 people are killed and 200 injured in gun
violence each year in the city.
"Those who profit from this industry should help
pa\ loi the destnu lion llieit weapons cause," said su
pervisor Alicia Becerril, who sponsored the legislation.
Ihe sillh i \ isoi i ited an Amcri< an Medical Associa
tion report that said the average cost of a gun-related
emergency room admission is $40,000. If the victim is
uninsured, those costs are borne by taxpayers.
Gun-rights advocates criticized the idea, saying it
would remove responsibility for gunshot injuries from
the people who actually inflict them and would increase
the price of weapons if they are suddenly liable for the
medical costs of gunshot victims.
