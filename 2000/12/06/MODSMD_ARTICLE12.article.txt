1927
()n Dec. (j, 1927, The Daily ran an article
called "Architect Praises Campus
Dormitories."
" 'Stanford's dormitories are the finest 1
have ever seen; they even surpass those of
()xlord and (lambridge,' says W. Gray
Young, Wellington, New Zealand, architect
who made an inspection yesterday of the
campus residence halls to study their con
struction and plan.
" 'The planning of the dormitory build
ings here is really marvelous. Everything
seems to have been though of for the con
servation of time and labor,' lie says.
"Asked what he thought of Stanford's lo
cation, Young replied, 'It is, indeed, situat
ed in a delightful atmosphere. I he climate
here is the best I've found in my travels
around the globe. As a place in which to
live, Clalifbrnia is the best yet.'
"Young is visiting this country to gather
material lor two quarter-million dormitories
which he is to design lor the Victoria Col
lege branch of New Zealand University,
which is situated in Wellington, N.Z."
Bottom line: The man tells it like it is, even 77
years later.
