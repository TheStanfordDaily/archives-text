Stanford University gives off a
laid-back liberal arts glow, from its
inviting Spanish Mission-style li
braries to its lazy palm-dotted quads.
But look closer. Like the robotic
sheriff in the Yul Brynner film West
world, its circuits are showing. . . .
And newly installed in the presi
dent \s office is John Hennessy, a long
time Stanford computer science pro
fessor who took a leave in 1984-85 to
create MIPS Technologies, a micro
processor company he later sold for
$ 330 million.
Nothing better represents Stan
ford's rededication to its deep Silicon
Valley roots — it incubated legends
Hewlett-Packard and Sun (once Stan
ford University Networks) Microsys
tems — than last month's inaugura
tion of Hennessy.
