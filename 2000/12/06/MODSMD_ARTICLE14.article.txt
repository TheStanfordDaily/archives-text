An opposition official estimated
that about .SO people have been
killed.
Youths with mat betes and iron
bars set up roadblocks to find, and
often beat, members of enemy
tribes as the t it\ once known as the
"Paris of Africa' turned into a

shattered the country's reputation
as a haven ol financial and political
securit\ in a region wracked In

bullets fought running battles with
the protesters, shooting seven

At makeshift roadblocks ol logs,
rocks .uid burning tires, veiling
men demanded identity cards to
c heck people's names. The cards
often indicate ethnic, and some
times religious, background.
A roving crowd ol people who
said 11 lev were supporters of (ibag

attacked a group of men leaving a
mosque, beating one to death with
bricks and machetes, witnesses
said.
