However, the timing of the study does not
seem relevant to its goals. The County and the
I 'niversity agree that the sustailiability study
w ill not affect the development plans outlined in
the latest GUP Why, then, after nearly two years
ol preparation and negotiation, must the Uni
vcrsitv embark on an equally lengthy project
only live years from now?
While the five-year requirement seems like a
wav to effectively approve only half the GUP, the
supervisors insist that it will not prevent com
pletion of the building permitted in the current
plan. The measure is designed to prevent a sit
uation in which Stanford is running out of per
mitted land and must scramble to approve its
plan. The Board wants the study completed be
iore Stanford has finished the building provid
ed in this current permit.
Rather than having Stanford spend two out
ofeverv five years assessing, reviewing and peti
tioning to the (lounty for approval, we suggest
that Stanford be required to complete the study
only belore its General Use Permit has elapsed.
Stanford should be able to determine how to
complete the studv indue time.
I lie board s insistence that the study occur at
the hallwav mark does little more than keep the
I niversitv in constant negotiation with the

County, above and beyond the case-by-case re
view necessary to approve each individual
building project.
Supervisor 1 )onald (iage admits that the sus
tainability study will be an opportunity to re
assess the development plans, and Supervisor
James Beall said that the board chose the
halfway mark in order to ensure that the same
supervisors are still in a position to review the
study. This reasoning is indefensible. The Su
pervisors are overstepping the limits of their
influence.
The second provision, that certain low-in
come housing be created that will not be avail
able to graduate students and medical residents,
is not the place of the (lounty to demand.
With this area's current housing crunch and
skyrocketing housing prices, providing for low
income Stanford affiliates is an imperative. Even
more than research and academic building,
housing must be a top priority for Stanford.
()f particular concern is housing for Stanford
staff, for whom the turnover rate is an unrea
sonably high 25 percent. Because many stall ca
reers do not become much more lucrative, it is
necessary to provide permanent housing for
workers and their families. Just as Palo Alto re
quires that 10 to 20 percent of new units be des-

ignated as low-income housing, Stanford
should ensure that a significant portion of its
housing is available to workers in a low econom
ic bracket.
Stanford graduate students and medical res
idents fall in that bracket. According to Palo
Alto's specifications, the salaries ol graduate stu
dents and medical residents are well below the
low-income specifications.
Unfortunately, Stanford cannot build unlim
ited housing. It has to make choices, and to cut
low-income graduate students and medical res
idents off from the benef its of low-income hous
ing projects would be detrimental to the goals of
the University. While these affiliates can expect
to make more money in the future, we should
not discourage people from embarking on the
journey through discriminatory housing
policies.
The Board of Supervisors needs to step back
from negotiations and determine how involved
in Stanford development it really should be.
The University and the County share many of
the same goals, and it is imperative that they
work together, but these provisions look like
more of a power trip for the Santa Clara Coun
ty Board than a collaboration toward positive
goals.
