There .ire two things I've learned

I \ei \ da\ Ihe smart folks who run uni
v< i situ s find new wavs to explain the ben
efits « >| education. Learning, they claim,
helps us to undeistand ourselves and the
woi M around ns, to see meaning where
oihei s see lad and loi in where others see
function.
I i est benelits are virtues of an educat
ed mind, but 11 ie\ miss ihe central point: A
libei al education tea< lies us how to waste
tune ,u ilully.
Ins« liool, we leai n how to listen to
tniisK . in case we are evei near a concert
hall, how to look al ai l, in ( ase we are ever
ileal a museum: and how to enjo\ litera
tim in i ase we are evei siiu k next to an
insui uue salesman on an overseas flight.
Indeed, a libei al education (an leac hus to
'lam i to plav sports, even to cook. Ihe
purpose ol libei a I mental training is not to
b< (oin< wealthv. bin something much
rii liei to lie Ibrevci enterlained.
I he real lest lor the educated mind is
not finals week, but the week that comes
alter.

It's a dirtx secret that any one whose
feelings aren't hurt by B-pluses can sur
vive exams here vvilli time to spare lor a
few games of bond on his roommate's
Nintendo 04. But who can stand a week at
home, when all our friends are still at
school and there's nothing to do but spike
another carton ol eggnog?
I "his crisis is w here a liberal education
comes in handy.
I he purpose of vacation is not to restore
all our c<>gnitivc powers so that we are pre
pared to exhaust them again next quarter.
Rather, the purpose ol our education is
that we might full\ enjoy our vacations.
Alter all, the word "school" comes from
the (Ireek word skole, meaning leisure. By
giving us I bod lor thought and inspiring
us to travel and learn, education makes
our free lime fruitful, not restless.
It's important that we devote ourselves
to a measure of relaxation. ()ur education
prepares us for fruitful recreation; it
should not bind us to ceaseless labor.
Writing on capitalism a century ago.
Max Webei noted that "one does not work
to live, one lives to work." I lis comment is
a sad testament to the slate of our nation's
investment bankers, consultants and high
paid office mules.
I nless it's necessary for providing
lood, shelter or clothing for you or your
loved ones, I sav, avoid all servile work
during the holiday. Instead, take your
sweetheart danc ing, plant a tree, write a
poem, do anything but work!
Consider it a second declaration of in
dependence: We, the United States of
America, rich enough to make the Sun
King blink, need not toil all year long.
Once we have agreed not to work, we
step out of the boundaries of everyday life
and experience the world in an different
way. Leisure instructs us to celebrate our
unique place in the universe, and in doing
so, it gives us a glimpse of an unending
holiday apart from this world.
It would be a pity if we didn't know how
to spend that vacation.
