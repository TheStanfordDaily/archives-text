Between 1875 and 1960, Stanford developed
buildings on roughly 4.3 million square feet of its
lands. That adds up to approximately 100 of the
University's 8, ISO acres. If you took a stroll around
all of the Farm in 1960, you would have found al-

most 99 percent of the land was open space, ex
cluding faculty housing.
After 1960, fueled by massive boosts in federal
research funding, Stanford expanded at a much
faster pace. Today, 282 acres of the University's
land is taken up by buildings. That still leaves
about 96 percent of the University's lands unde
veloped.
It may sound like a lot of room for expansion,
but Stanford already has a higher population den
sity than Palo Alto.
More buildings bring more people, and local
roads are already strained under the traffic flow.
University officials and community representatives
agree that the exponential growth of the last 40
years can't continue indefinitely. It probably can't
even continue for the next century.
But, at the moment, Stanford has no official pic
ture of its ultimate level of growth. It has never
been required to study the limits of sustainable de
velopment on its lands.
Stanford Director of Government and Commu
nity Relations Larry Morton has said that the Uni
versity planned to commission such a "sustainabil
ity study" before applying for its next development
permit in 2010.
Because of the efforts of Santa Clara County Su
pervisor Joe Simitian, ii looks like the study will
have to be finished five years earlier than the Uni
versity expected.
The origins of Simitian's sustainability study
proposal stretch back two years, to Nov. 1999,
when Stanford applied to Santa Clara County to
build 2,035,000 square feet of academic facilities
and enough housing for 3,018 people.
That magnitude of growth would make the next
decade more expansive than any other in Stanford
history, adding more new development than oc
cured in the first 85 years combined.
Last week, Simitian proposed that Stanford be
required to begin a study of its maximum potential
for growth before it starts building the second mil
lion square feet of academic facilities in its request.
While the University will commission the study.
