Gaieties portrayal of Native Americans
offensive and ignorant
The purpose of Gaieties is to make fun
of Gal, Big Game and Stanford. 'This does
not include picking on minority groups
such as the Native Americans just to make
a joke turn out right.
The Stanford Powwow, put on by the
Stanford American Indian Organization
and many others of the Stanford commu
nity who donate their time, is the largest
cultural event held on campus. We hope
that this is something that Stanford can be
proud of: Its students hold the largest stu
dent-run powwow in the nation.
We cannot speak for the other groups
that were made fun of or portrayed in the
production of Gaieties. That is up to them.
As Native Americans, we represent our
own small group on campus. It makes it

even harder to do outreach programs
(such as Creation, Outreach, Respect and
Kducation) on the Stanford campus that
teach others about our culture when
stereotypes about us continue to be por
trayed in productions such as Gaieties.
Many people at Stanford do not take
the time to consult us before they clo such
blatant ac ts as those portrayed in Gaieties.
This whole situation could have been
avoided if everyone was educated.
Instead, ignorance brought about this
conflict.
Stanford students are praised for their
ability to learn and their desire to learn
about other cultures. We merely ask you
to take a moment and learn about our cul
ture. You don't have to understand it, you
don't even have to accept it, but we want
you to at least see where we are coming
from.

lii the Gaieties performance, the actors
portrayed powwow in a stereotypical way.
1 ons, powwow is not just smoking a pipe,
doing war whoops and dancing in circles.
What powwow really is, is a chance tor all
indiginons people to gather together, to
dance our sacred songs, to have fellowship
with other indigenous people and cele
brate part of our spiritual life.
War whoops are a thing of the movies.
What people don't understand is that we
don't go around doing them at powwows
or upon request from fellow classmates.
Most people don't even understand that
war whoops are done only with the
mouth, and not in the stereotypical "old
western style with the hand, as portrayed
in Gaieties.
lastly, we are hurt by the depiction of
the use of the sacred pipe. The pipe is not
passed around small groups .is .in ice
breaker or as something lodo in our spare
lime. 1 lie pipe is the local point lot mam
Native American religions.
The effect of the actresses' pan
tomime of this sacred ritual on stage
would he as to a (christian seeing .1 ( toss
being broken or thrown on the ground
to stamp on.
It astounds us how our peers leel it is
ok.i\ to perpetuate stereotypes about am
group based on their culture, race, reli
gion or sexual ptclcrcnc e, and to do so in

sin ha public: production is sad. And lor all
ofthose people who feel that (Gaieties can
not exist without "making fun of every
one." we believe that it can exist without
the use of stereoivpes directed at groups
based on iheir culture, race, religion or
sexual preference.
Sianlord is well known lor the intellect
ol its students and to make fun of some
one, or .1 group, such as has been done in
(laieties performances, can be seen as a
ver\ low level of humor.
We leave you with this one thought:
Remember the ('.olden Rule. Treat others
how vou wish to be treated.
