# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Gender disparities in interracial dating betray ongoing racism 
### AUSTIN CHUNG GUEST COLUMNIST 
Dining nn last summer at Stan
ford, I spent live weeks at Bei
jing University with 20 other
Stanlord students. In addition
to opening my eves to another world. m\
experience also provided me with insights
into the Western sot iet\ th.it I left behind.
In particular, one unforgettable experi
ence gave me a clear lesson on Western at
titudes about Asian women.
Main Chinese college students, like
their American counterparts, leave their
campus dormitories on Frida\ night to
dance and part\ in"the c it\ One week
end while I was in China. I went with sev
eral Asian-American and Caucasian
friends to one of the more popular Chi
nese disct >s.
At one moment during the night, I
glanced over to see m\ t\pi(.ill\ sh\ Cau
casian male classmate aggressiveh Ireak
ing a rather pretty Asian female stranger.
Shocked. 1 took meat interest in the go

ings-on and continued to watch. Most of
the girls tjuickh moved away in order to
avoid him. but I was soon disgusted as I
watched him go from one girl to the next,
apparcnth enjoving himself too much to
not ice m\ stare. As one of nn Asian female
classmates remarked after returning
home, "I le li caked every girl on the dance
floor. '
I doubt that he would have dared to be
have in such a disrespectful manner had
we been at Polyesters or PheSound Pacto
rv. I was compelled to wonder what pre
conceived notions attracted him so forciblv
to the ( Chinese girls at the dub, as well as
what allowed him to demonstrate such ol
lensive beha\ i< >rand lack of respect.
( Cm) entlv, depending on the region or
nationalitv, outmarriage rates for Asian
Americans range from 2."> percent to j()
percent, according to 19 l .)(i Census data.
I listoricallv. in a sot ietv colored by racism,
minorities in the I nitcd States have often
been viewed as holding an inferior social
siatus relative to the majority. Most people
like i < (believe that increasing rates of Asian

outmarriage indicate the dissolution ol
racism and social stratification.
I lowever, the gender disparities in dat
ing trends, even at Stanlord, are a strong
indicator that patterns of racial stratifica
tion in dating and marriage patterns are
still well .md strong. In a patriarchal soci
et\ like the United States, men are gener
ally expected to hold a higher social posi
tion — through financial status, ethnicity
or education — than their female spouses.
As a result, it is easier lor males of the high
er-status majority group to marry minori
ty women than for lower-status minority
males to marry women of the majority
group.
Pile Daily article, "Interracial Couples
thrive at Stanford," Nov. 30, stated that
the ratio of Asian female / (Caucasian male
marriages to Asian male / Caucasian Ic
male marriages are approximately 4:1.
However, Tomoyuki lanaka, a
renowned researcher on the topic ol Asian
outmarriages, estimates that the actual
dating rates (the ones we actually see) are
somewhere between 10:1 and 20:1. Last

year, I researched the si.iius of Asian
Caucasian intermarriages in Santa ( l.ua

dating rates (the ones we actually see) are
somewhere between 10:1 and 20:1. Last

year, I researched the si.iius of Asian
Caucasian intermarriages in Santa ( l.ua
(Count v c<>unt\ by ct>llc< ting data on a lew
thousand marriages iliai took pl.i< e in ilic
last decade, and I found ili.it the same
comparison yielded a ratio ol approxi
mately 10:1.
I bus, the man iage and dating patterns
of Asians and (Caucasians may relict I.i still
very sociallv stratified society. 1 he fin I that
the gender disparit\ in Asian outmarriage
lias increased in the last two de< ades < < >n
tradicts the popular belief that rat ial ban i
ers in the I nitcd Slates are disst>l\ ing.
I his phenomenon max be explained in
large part In the feminism movement ol
the last few decades. As ( aucasian women
make substantial income and sot ial status
gains relative to their male counterparts,
some Caucasian men ma\ be leeling in
creasing pressure to look elsewhere to
continue the trend of "marr\ ing down.'
Thus, women of disadvantaged minorit\
groups become incieasingh "attrat live."
I'lie attractiveness of inet|ualit\ ma\ be
a kev factor coniributini> to the sexual ob

jet tilu anon and stereotvpes of Asian
women as being gentle, e\oiit. submissive
and so on. Pleni\ ol evidence ol these per

B\ suggesting that social stratification
has contributed to patterns ol gentler tlis
pariiics in Asian outmarriages. 1 am not as
serting that all Asian (Caucasian relation
ships are the result of racial inecjualitx. In
the end. attraction happens lor a multi
tude ol reasons. I lowever, as we continue
to strive lot greater sot ial et|ualit\ and lul

even in our sense ol beauty.
