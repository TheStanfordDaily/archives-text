# Olympian Jennings protests Dish policies with his feet
## Cross-country team members stray from newly paved path, outrun area guards 
### JIMMY WU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Olympic middle-distance runner Gabe Jen
nings, has put a unique twist on student protest of
the new policy in tlit* Dish that restricts hikers and
runners to the paved path.
According to the guards, Jennings, a senior, was
recently spotted violating this particular policy by
running off the pathway.
"One of our officers called to him. However,
Jennings kept running. The officer initially chased
Jennings, but that didn't work very well, said
Stanford Police Lt. Del Bandy in a recent article in
The San Francisco Chronicle.
The police locked the gate, but Jennings ig
nored their order to stop and continued running
after jumping over the fence.
Jennings could not be readied for comment,
but several cross-country teammates shared the
Olympian's sentiments.
"I disobey those trail rules everyday," said se
nior Michael Stember, a fellow Olympian. "What
ever it takes to get our trails we [the men's cross
country team] will do. Those trails are essential for
my teammates and mv own training regimen,

which requires 12 to 20 miles a day to be at four]
best."
Junior cross-country runner Nathan Stoll
agreed.
"The University's action was wrong because it
was typical and institutionalized: Pave it. fence it,
patrol it,"he said. "The University went from tak
ing no action to prevent Foothill damage to the
chokingly strict policy of today with little consider
ation of other possibilities."
Stoll said that the reason he and some of his
teammates run on the Foothills is not to make a
statement but simply to "run freely in places that
will not give [the runners] stress-fractures from
high-impact surfaces."
Senior Jonathon Riley, also a cross-country run
ner, echoed this protest.
"In my opinion, the new road has ruined the
Foothills and contradicts the idea of a natural aca
demic preserve," Riley said. "()ne would think that
a 4.5-mile road wide enough for two lanes <>l traf
fic would do much more damage to the Foothills
and it is much more permanent."
I lowever, the administration promises steps to
ward an eventual resolution to the problem.
"We can well imagine that a path for runners,
such as Mr. Jennings and other students, could be
put in place," said Jeffrey Wachtel, special assistant
to the president and provost, in response to the
students' requests fora different policy. "We ex
pect to put together an advisory group on the Dish
access policy to see how we might respond to the

concerns that have been voiced."
University President John Hennessy will re
evaluate the policy next year and invite interested
parties along with the proper expertise to help re
solve the issue, according to Director ol Govern
ment and Community Relations Larry I lorton.
According to Bandy, no one, including Jen
nings, has been cited or charged for trespassing in
the Foothills.
"To date, our entire Foothills operation has
been geared toward educating the patrons on the
new policies," he said.
Last May, in response to various environmental
and ecological concerns, former I ni\crsit\ Presi
dent Gerhard Casper issued a statement that
called for preserving the area around the Dish,
and all of the Foothills, in order to make n suitable
for recreational use and for existing and further
academic use.
Stanford took subsequent ac tion l>\ restricting
access to certain areas of the Foothills, including
the sec tion that houses the large Dish antenna.
Prior to the new school year, the Foothills were
closed clown in order to install a newlx paved four
mile path along with a fence around the Dish.
When it reopened, Stanford issued policies lor
using the Foothills, especialh the area around the
Dish.
"Although it is ver\ tempting to compromise on
conservation policies in the face ol criticism, [Stan
ford] believe|s] that we must slav the course ii we
hope to preserve the Dish area, Wachtel said.


The Stanford Daily File
Gabe Jennings, a member of the Stanford cross country
team, and other team members have ianored the Univer
sity's new Dish policies. The team regularly runs in the re
stricted areas of the Foothills because the paved areas
often cause injuries.
