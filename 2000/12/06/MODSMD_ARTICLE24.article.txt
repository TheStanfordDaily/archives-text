# Dead Week pranks, traditions abound

"YVhal is all that screaming?"
asked freshman Mark Miller as
he looked up wearih from his In
troduction to the Humanities
paper Sunday at midnight.
Apparently he hadn't read
item number 17 of Stanford
magazine's "101 Things You
Must Do Before Graduating."
After being told about the Primal
St ream, Miller could be found
st reaming on the Quad the next
night.
I his week, studying seems to
be on the minds of main stu
dents. With large quantities of
caffeine in their systems, stu
dents have been hunkering
down to study that chapter
they've never had the time to
read before.
In between bouts of stud\ing,
a variety of activities abound for
the overworked student.
Tradition has long held that
the Primal Scream occurs even
midnight during Dead Week.
During Primal Scream, students
relieve stress by yelling .n the top
of their lungs out their dorm
windows.
One of the largest activities
sweeping campus is the Secret
Snowllake phenomenon. Sin
dents are anonymously paired.
Then, every da\ fora week,
each person who participates is
given an embarassing task b\ Ins
Set ret Snowllake to be complet
ed that day.
I o add another dimension to
this activity, students who partic

ipate in Secret Snowllake must
choose a level of comfort to de
termine how willing they are to
perform certain activities.
An example of a level one ac
tivity, which is considered the
least embarrassing, is singing the
AIM Is in the middle of dinner or
coming to dinner dressed as
Tar/an. I asks near level live get
a little more interesting. They in
clude. but are not limited to,
stripteases, erotic poems, lap
dances and an\ other cra/\ idea
that the Secret Snowllake can
think of.
"It's a great way to relax and
just have some fun," said junior
Resident Assistant Rhiannon
Meier, coordinator ol Set ret
Snowllake for Alondra.
At the end ol the week, the Se
cret Snowllake reveals his identi
ty to the student he has been em
barassing all week and the two
exchange presents.
Some students have created
their own stress-relieving activi
ties for Dead Week. Residents in
Robinson conducted their verv
own hermit crab race, during
which students bet on which t rab
they thought would win the rat e.
1 he organi/ors gave out prizes
it) those who bet on the winning
crab.
()t her dorm-bonding activities
can be lound all over campus. In
Ihe p.ist twt) weeks, some dorms
have rented ice skating links to
play broom I).ill and < hallenged
rival dormitories to play (iapture
the Flag in the Quad in an at
tempt to vent their frustrations.
