## 
### NICHOLAS CHAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As Stanlbrd students prepare
to return to their rooms in their
hometowns, they should also pre
pare to have their dormitory
rooms inspected.
During winter break, I lousing
and Dining Services will inspect
stndents' rooms for maintenance
and safety reasons as they do
every year.
I liese routine inspections are
conducted during winter and
spring break. According to Imo
gen Church, the undergraduate
housing operations manager,
these examinations, which cover
dormiton common areas and pri
vate dormitory rooms, are "for
the purpose of identifying main
tenance needs; ensuring health,
safety and cleanliness standards
are being maintained; and plan
ning for renovation or refurbish
ment projects."
In addition to inspecting
rooms. Housing and Dining Ser
vices workers will secure unlocked
doors, close open windows and
lest all smoke alarms.
Dining these inspections, the
representatives will also look Un
forbidden items that are in plain
sight m students' rooms. These
items include candles, torches,
halogen lamps, hazardous mate
rials. pets and University furni
ture that belongs in common
areas.
According to Church, candles
and torches are prohibited be
cause of their risk to life and prop
em. Halogen lamps are also re
stricted because the\ are .1 fire

hazard and because of their high
energy usage.
Hazardous materials, such as
barbecue grills, charcoal fluids,
acid, explosives and camping
lanterns are also included under
this policy.
Pets, including fish and c aged
animals, are forbidden in the
dormitories.
" 1 lie pet policy protects those
with severe allergies and the facil
ities, and, in some cases the wel
fare of the pet," (-lunch said.
Students who are caught with
any of these materials will be
c harged $100 upon discoverv of
the item. If the item is not re
moved immediately, students will
be fined an additional $100 for
even dax that the offending item
is not removed.
According to ('.liurch, pieces of
furniture from the dormitory
common areas are also forbidden
in students rooms to "[ensure]
that this furniture is made avail
able to i he entile housecommuni
t\ rather than individuals." 1 he
first lime that furniture is discov
ered. students will be asked to re
turn ii to the common area. 11 the
furniture policy is violated a sec
ond time, students will bee barged
lor the furniture.
A t\ pical dormitory inspection
is conducted b\ a facilities super
visor and one other member of
the Student Housing Services
stall. Possible violations are writ
ten down and residents are in
formed ol anv changes they need
to make or any items they need to
remove. For anv item that needs
to be taken care of immediatelv,
"a work order will be entered hv

the supervisor for corrective ac
tion to be taken," according to
('.lunch.
Student reaction to the I Hiver
sity Housing Polio varies. Some
students are ollended In the poli
cies. especial!) freshmen who are
encountering the regulations for
the first time this year.
" I he University policy is ver\
harsh and credits ns with very lit
tle intelligence — as if we didn't
know that fire is dangerous,"
freshman Rose Fdmonds said.
One sophomore, who wished
to remain nameless, keeps a disco
ball, track lighting and c andles in
his room. I le also disagreed with
the I niversitv policy.
"Restrictions can't Mop stupid
people from burning clown
dorms . . . they will find a wax to

"I think the I niversity's policy
is justified because lire is danger

Burgess. "I can't really justify my
breaking the rules other than I
know thai the candles are being
used saleh. ilius not violating ihe
spirit of the law."
"I keep candles in m\ room
