## Nader traders: The efficacy of vote swapping 
### JEFF WU 
Just one year ago, many cyber-boosiers
had hoped thai we would look back at this
elect ion <is the one in which the Internet
came into its own, similar to the way televi
sion first became a dominant lorce in pres
idential elections in the 1900 Kennedv-
Nixon election. Hut I hey were wrong: The
Internet remained a bit player-it spurred
a little lundraising, made the process ol re
trieving position papers a little more con
venient and was somewhat helpful in or
ganizing volunteers. But I believe the most
notable aspect of this e-election was the
way the "Nader Traders" tried to route
around the "multi-party problem."
fhe multi-party issue sul fates because
any election that involves more than two
candidates is inherently unstable. The
problem occurs when a candidate that a
majority ol the population dislikes wins
because his opponents split the vote. (Note
that this is a dilemma particular to the
"first-past-i lie-post" systems most U.S. ju
risdictions use. In these systems, whoever
gets the most votes in a certain district, or
state, wins all the electors, or wins the seat.
There are a few electoral variations which
avoid iliis problem, such as the propor
tional representation system that (lam
bridge, Mass. uses to fill ils city council).
A few months ago, as it became clear
I his was going i<> be a close election
(though none of us imagined how close),
some Green Party supporters realized that
if they voted for Ralph Nader, they might
split the vote on the left and allow Repub
lican candidate George YV. Bush to win the
presidency. But if they held their noses
and voted lor Democratic candidate A1
Gore, they wouldn't be true to their con
sciences and would hurt the Green Party's
chances of gaining the 5 percent of the na
tional vote required to receive federal
matching funds in the next election. This
5 percent vote would likely have been
worth approximately $7 million to the
Green Party.
But a few Web site operators, spurred

on in part by a column written by constitu
tional law professor James Raskin in the
online magazine Slate, tried to solve the
problem. They set up Web sites that al
lowed a (lore voter in an uncontested state

- such as Texas, or
New York â€”to otter to
vote for Nader, in re
turn fora Nader
voter in a swing state
such as Florida - of
fering to vote for
Gore. Thus, Gore
would have an in
< leased shot at win
ning the swing states,
their electoral votes
and the election. But
Nader would not be
impeded in his quest
for the magical 5 per
cent.
By the time the
mainstream media
got hold of the story,
there were about a
dozen of these vote
trading sites up and
operating. The cre
ators of one site,
www. V< >teSwap2ooo.
org, said they had set
up some 2,500 vote

swaps the first four days the site was up. In
other words, 2,500 Gore voters in fexas.
New York and Massachusetts were ofler
ing to vote for Nader in exchange for
2,500 Nader voters in Washington, Ore
gon and Florida voting for Gore. Some
20,000 votes were swapped among the
dozen or so sites. A decent-sized number,
considering how close the election was in
some of these states.
An ingenious way to route around a
problem, right? Problem is, it may not be
legal. At least a few states charged that
these sites violated their election laws -
among them, Wisconsin, Arizona, New
York and California. California Secretary
of State Bill Jones, a Republican, sent let

lers threatening criminal prosecution to
two such sites - VoteSwap2ooo, and Vo
tExchange2ooo, which prompth shut
themselves down. A few days later, the
AGLI asked a judge to allow the sites to

reopen; the judge refused. The ACLI
said that "(fjhe issue is not yet settled. We
will pursue tins case.
The state of ('.aliiornia's .11 giunent goes
something like (his: California Flection
Law Section 18521 states ili.it it is illegal
lor anyone to agree "before, during or
alter an election." to vole in e\change lor
"any monev, gift, loan, oi other valuable
consideration." I lie penalty? Prison lor
up to three years. A promise from anothei
voter to vote a certain wav is "valuable con
sideration." 1 herefore, interne t vole trad
ing, or any vote trading, is illegal.
The defendant vote tradei has three ar
guments: I) an unenforceable promise
isn't "valuable consideration;" 2) there's a

long tradition of this sort ol thing among
representatives in Congress and stale leg
islatures; and 3) the First Amendment
protects iheir right to discuss online their
political views and voting preferences, and

these matching ser
vices are simply one
wa\ of doing this.
After all, a husband
and wife can agree
that since their votes
cancel each other's
out, they'll just stay
away from the polls,
right?
The state's an
swer to the first argu
ment is that it's prob
ably wrong. Is an mi
enlbrc cable promise
"valuable?" Sure it
is. No one would
aigue that trading a
vote for someone's
promise to buy you a
pack of cigarettes
after the election
isn't illegal - it surely
is.
The state's an
swer to the second
argument is that the
law applies to elec-

lions, not legislative votes.
In my opinion, though, argument
three, is a winner. Fven if this behavior vi
< dates the (.alilornia election law, the state
shouldn't be able to en lore c it because it vi
olates these voters' First Amendment
rights to deliberate important issues of
public polio in a c\berspace forum, with
like-minded voters. And even if some ol
the direct trading sites right now might
not be protec led. it would be pretty easy to
modify them so that the)'re nothing more
than aggregation points lor Gore and
Nader voters from certain states who
c<mid chat a bit, exchange e-mail address
es and then go offline to surreptitiously ex
change their votes.

But, in my mind, the more interesting
question isn't whether these sites are legal,
but what eflect they'll have on elections.
It's tough to see this phenomenon grow
ing beyond a small minority (though 1 was
saying the same thing about eBay until a
few vears ago). The lad that these promis
es are unenforceable will naturally limit
the spread of this phenomenon. Note that
Bush voters could have jumped in and
pretended to be Nader supporters. And
note also that Nader voters had the incen
tive to cheat on Election Day, thereby gain
ing two votes for Nader, instead of one.
And finally, note that it's almost certainly
not in the long-term interest of the Demo
cratic part) to have a vibrant, active, leder
allv-funded Green Party.
The real problem might come, though,
if this principle were applied to Congres
sional elections. I'll support your Democ
ratic candidate in San Jose if you support
niv Green Party candidate in Berkeley.
(1 his example only works il in San Jose the
Democrat is dose, but might lose due to
voles being siphoned off by a (ircen candi
date, and vice versa in Berkeley). In niv
opinion, this would be a real problem, be
cause voters outside a congressional dis
trict shouldn't be influencing that election.
II a true third party were to ever rise, it
might require sophisticated central steer
ing of votes. (Richard Gephardt and
Ralph Nader make a deal to tell all (ireens
in district X (>. and <S to vote Democrat, and
all Democrats in districts 1,2,4, and 5 vote
Green.)
I his is, in fact, simply a magnification of'
the same issue with respect to the electoral
college in presidential elections. I lowever,
n seems worse because most people don't
think of the electoral college with the same
level of sanctity as a Congressional seat. In
tlieorv, a voter from California shouldn't
be messing with the Electoral College
process in Florida, but lots of people think
the Electoral College is archaic anyhow,
and that whoever gets the most votes

should just plain win.
This all mav sound somewhat
fanciful, bin active voter-trader
sites in I lie (lanadian ledei al elec
tion last week might have made .1
big difference. In Canada, there
were live major parlies contest
ing the election, with lots ol Note
splitting going on. In 93 <>l the
300 races, the winner had fewer
votes than hei two biggest riv;ils
combined.
I'm a little queasy about all <>l
1 bis vote tl ading. At its simplest lev
els- the levels that appealed in this
election - I believe it's Constitu
tionally protected, but if the phe
nomenon were to begin to destabi
lize the election svstem. Congress

could probabh put in plate laws
backed bv <1 strong enough state in
terest iluit it could curtail these
First Amendment liberties. II the
system were ever to become ven
complicated (i.e., if one 01 more
true third parties were to emerge),
the gamesmanship that would in
evitably result would blunt the sim
ple power ol the electoral process. I
believe tli.it would harm the coun
try in the long run.
Ifyou want to be strategic about
your vote, you should just hold
your nose and vote for the more
mainstream, "lesser of two evils,'
candidate. Swapping votes could
lead us down a dangerous path.

(though none of us imagined how close),
some Green Party supporters realized that
if they voted for Ralph Nader, they might
split the vote on the left and allow Repub
lican candidate George YV. Bush to win the
presidency. But if they held their noses
and voted lor Democratic candidate A1
Gore, they wouldn't be true to their con
sciences and would hurt the Green Party's
chances of gaining the 5 percent of the na
tional vote required to receive federal
matching funds in the next election. This
5 percent vote would likely have been
worth approximately $7 million to the
Green Party.
But a few Web site operators, spurred

on in part by a column written by constitu
tional law professor James Raskin in the
online magazine Slate, tried to solve the
problem. They set up Web sites that al
lowed a (lore voter in an uncontested state

- such as Texas, or
New York â€”to otter to
vote for Nader, in re
turn fora Nader
voter in a swing state
such as Florida - of
fering to vote for
Gore. Thus, Gore
would have an in
< leased shot at win
ning the swing states,
their electoral votes
and the election. But
Nader would not be
impeded in his quest
for the magical 5 per
cent.
By the time the
mainstream media
got hold of the story,
there were about a
dozen of these vote
trading sites up and
operating. The cre
ators of one site,
www. V< >teSwap2ooo.
org, said they had set
up some 2,500 vote

swaps the first four days the site was up. In
other words, 2,500 Gore voters in fexas.
New York and Massachusetts were ofler
ing to vote for Nader in exchange for
2,500 Nader voters in Washington, Ore
gon and Florida voting for Gore. Some
20,000 votes were swapped among the
dozen or so sites. A decent-sized number,
considering how close the election was in
some of these states.
An ingenious way to route around a
problem, right? Problem is, it may not be
legal. At least a few states charged that
these sites violated their election laws -
among them, Wisconsin, Arizona, New
York and California. California Secretary
of State Bill Jones, a Republican, sent let

lers threatening criminal prosecution to
two such sites - VoteSwap2ooo, and Vo
tExchange2ooo, which prompth shut
themselves down. A few days later, the
AGLI asked a judge to allow the sites to

reopen; the judge refused. The ACLI
said that "(fjhe issue is not yet settled. We
will pursue tins case.
The state of ('.aliiornia's .11 giunent goes
something like (his: California Flection
Law Section 18521 states ili.it it is illegal
lor anyone to agree "before, during or
alter an election." to vole in e\change lor
"any monev, gift, loan, oi other valuable
consideration." I lie penalty? Prison lor
up to three years. A promise from anothei
voter to vote a certain wav is "valuable con
sideration." 1 herefore, interne t vole trad
ing, or any vote trading, is illegal.
The defendant vote tradei has three ar
guments: I) an unenforceable promise
isn't "valuable consideration;" 2) there's a

long tradition of this sort ol thing among
representatives in Congress and stale leg
islatures; and 3) the First Amendment
protects iheir right to discuss online their
political views and voting preferences, and

these matching ser
vices are simply one
wa\ of doing this.
After all, a husband
and wife can agree
that since their votes
cancel each other's
out, they'll just stay
away from the polls,
right?
The state's an
swer to the first argu
ment is that it's prob
ably wrong. Is an mi
enlbrc cable promise
"valuable?" Sure it
is. No one would
aigue that trading a
vote for someone's
promise to buy you a
pack of cigarettes
after the election
isn't illegal - it surely
is.
The state's an
swer to the second
argument is that the
law applies to elec-

lions, not legislative votes.
In my opinion, though, argument
three, is a winner. Fven if this behavior vi
< dates the (.alilornia election law, the state
shouldn't be able to en lore c it because it vi
olates these voters' First Amendment
rights to deliberate important issues of
public polio in a c\berspace forum, with
like-minded voters. And even if some ol
the direct trading sites right now might
not be protec led. it would be pretty easy to
modify them so that the)'re nothing more
than aggregation points lor Gore and
Nader voters from certain states who
c<mid chat a bit, exchange e-mail address
es and then go offline to surreptitiously ex
change their votes.

But, in my mind, the more interesting
question isn't whether these sites are legal,
but what eflect they'll have on elections.
It's tough to see this phenomenon grow
ing beyond a small minority (though 1 was
saying the same thing about eBay until a
few vears ago). The lad that these promis
es are unenforceable will naturally limit
the spread of this phenomenon. Note that
Bush voters could have jumped in and
pretended to be Nader supporters. And
note also that Nader voters had the incen
tive to cheat on Election Day, thereby gain
ing two votes for Nader, instead of one.
And finally, note that it's almost certainly
not in the long-term interest of the Demo
cratic part) to have a vibrant, active, leder
allv-funded Green Party.
The real problem might come, though,
if this principle were applied to Congres
sional elections. I'll support your Democ
ratic candidate in San Jose if you support
niv Green Party candidate in Berkeley.
(1 his example only works il in San Jose the
Democrat is dose, but might lose due to
voles being siphoned off by a (ircen candi
date, and vice versa in Berkeley). In niv
opinion, this would be a real problem, be
cause voters outside a congressional dis
trict shouldn't be influencing that election.
II a true third party were to ever rise, it
might require sophisticated central steer
ing of votes. (Richard Gephardt and
Ralph Nader make a deal to tell all (ireens
in district X (>. and <S to vote Democrat, and
all Democrats in districts 1,2,4, and 5 vote
Green.)
I his is, in fact, simply a magnification of'
the same issue with respect to the electoral
college in presidential elections. I lowever,
n seems worse because most people don't
think of the electoral college with the same
level of sanctity as a Congressional seat. In
tlieorv, a voter from California shouldn't
be messing with the Electoral College
process in Florida, but lots of people think
the Electoral College is archaic anyhow,
and that whoever gets the most votes

should just plain win.
This all mav sound somewhat
fanciful, bin active voter-trader
sites in I lie (lanadian ledei al elec
tion last week might have made .1
big difference. In Canada, there
were live major parlies contest
ing the election, with lots ol Note
splitting going on. In 93 <>l the
300 races, the winner had fewer
votes than hei two biggest riv;ils
combined.
I'm a little queasy about all <>l
1 bis vote tl ading. At its simplest lev
els- the levels that appealed in this
election - I believe it's Constitu
tionally protected, but if the phe
nomenon were to begin to destabi
lize the election svstem. Congress

could probabh put in plate laws
backed bv <1 strong enough state in
terest iluit it could curtail these
First Amendment liberties. II the
system were ever to become ven
complicated (i.e., if one 01 more
true third parties were to emerge),
the gamesmanship that would in
evitably result would blunt the sim
ple power ol the electoral process. I
believe tli.it would harm the coun
try in the long run.
Ifyou want to be strategic about
your vote, you should just hold
your nose and vote for the more
mainstream, "lesser of two evils,'
candidate. Swapping votes could
lead us down a dangerous path.

way the "Nader Traders" tried to route
around the "multi-party problem."
fhe multi-party issue sul fates because
any election that involves more than two
candidates is inherently unstable. The
problem occurs when a candidate that a
majority ol the population dislikes wins
because his opponents split the vote. (Note
that this is a dilemma particular to the
"first-past-i lie-post" systems most U.S. ju
risdictions use. In these systems, whoever
gets the most votes in a certain district, or
state, wins all the electors, or wins the seat.
There are a few electoral variations which
avoid iliis problem, such as the propor
