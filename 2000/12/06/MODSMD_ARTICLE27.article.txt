# Examining the basis of Darwinian theory

lew things rullle leathers faster
than a debate over evolution.
Sure, you could lalk about your
(Jod-givcn right lo a handgun, or
perhaps drop a learned comment
about Roe vs. Wade, but if you re
ally want to get the blood flowing
in polite debate, tell everyone
you're quite certain we descended
from apes.
Hie heated opinions regarding
evolution mask a sad fact: (Cultural
polarization about evolution pre
cludes a good deal ol scientific de
bate about the sped lies of evolu
tionary theory. To the mainstream
public, the debate over evolution
seems mired in a stand oil between
science and religion. But scientists
understand that evolution is just
like any scientific theory, open to
refinement, growth, change and
further explanation. However, a
nood deal of honest scientific de
bate regarding evolutionary theo
ry could be misconstrued as a chal
lenge to evolution itself, so scien
tists hide their debate from the
public.
A recent article by Dr. Michael
Ruse, "Limits to Our Knowledge
of Evolution," highlights some
particulars of this debate. Provoca
tive .is the title may be, Ruse is a an
admitted "traditional Darwinist."
He succinctly and objectively sur
vevs the current body of work di
rected towards the study of evolu
tion and examines the basis ol
some of the more persuasive ques
tions raised by the standard model
of evolution.
In keeping with the traditional
organization of evolutionary thco
r\. Ruse divides his discussion into

a distinction between the "fact" of
evolution, the "path" of evolution,
and the "theory or mechanisms"
of evolution.
In disc ussing the facts ol evolu
tion, Ruse refers to the original
Darwinian idea that all life lias de
scended from other, simpler
forms of lile that are propagated
through reproduction and subject
to natural constraints. Here Ruse
lias little patience for divergent
ideas; he points out that the collet -
live force of myriad different in
quiries, from lossil studies to em
bryology to genetic fingerprint
ing, all point conclusively to the
inter-relatedness of all life. Com
mon creationist criticisms of this
supposition center largely on con
fusion regarding the definition of
"theory," using the word in a cul
tural context such as," I have a the
ory about Kennedy's assassina
tion." rather than the scientific de
finition, Ruse writes.
But one line of criticism regard
ing evolutionary theory seems to
rely heavily on scientific princi
ples. Michael Belie, in a recently
published book titled "Darwin's
Black Box: The Biochemical Chal
lenge to Evolution," argues that
complex life exhibits an "irreduca
bility" that precludes a Darwinian
explanation. One example Belie
seizes on is the mechanism of
blood-clotting in mammals. In his
estimation, removing any of the
various biochemical factors of
blood clotting destroys the entire
process, proving that the system
could not have involved naturally
by building one factor on top of
another, because the system only
