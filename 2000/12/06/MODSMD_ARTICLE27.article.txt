lew things rullle leathers faster
than a debate over evolution.
Sure, you could lalk about your
(Jod-givcn right lo a handgun, or
perhaps drop a learned comment
about Roe vs. Wade, but if you re
ally want to get the blood flowing
in polite debate, tell everyone
you're quite certain we descended
from apes.
Hie heated opinions regarding
evolution mask a sad fact: (Cultural
polarization about evolution pre
cludes a good deal ol scientific de
bate about the sped lies of evolu
tionary theory. To the mainstream
public, the debate over evolution
seems mired in a stand oil between
science and religion. But scientists
understand that evolution is just
like any scientific theory, open to
refinement, growth, change and
further explanation. However, a
nood deal of honest scientific de
bate regarding evolutionary theo
ry could be misconstrued as a chal
lenge to evolution itself, so scien
tists hide their debate from the
public.
A recent article by Dr. Michael
Ruse, "Limits to Our Knowledge
of Evolution," highlights some
particulars of this debate. Provoca
tive .is the title may be, Ruse is a an
admitted "traditional Darwinist."
He succinctly and objectively sur
vevs the current body of work di
rected towards the study of evolu
tion and examines the basis ol
some of the more persuasive ques
tions raised by the standard model
of evolution.
In keeping with the traditional
organization of evolutionary thco
r\. Ruse divides his discussion into

a distinction between the "fact" of
evolution, the "path" of evolution,
and the "theory or mechanisms"
of evolution.
In disc ussing the facts ol evolu
tion, Ruse refers to the original
Darwinian idea that all life lias de
scended from other, simpler
forms of lile that are propagated
through reproduction and subject
to natural constraints. Here Ruse
lias little patience for divergent
ideas; he points out that the collet -
live force of myriad different in
quiries, from lossil studies to em
bryology to genetic fingerprint
ing, all point conclusively to the
inter-relatedness of all life. Com
mon creationist criticisms of this
supposition center largely on con
fusion regarding the definition of
"theory," using the word in a cul
tural context such as," I have a the
ory about Kennedy's assassina
tion." rather than the scientific de
finition, Ruse writes.
But one line of criticism regard
ing evolutionary theory seems to
rely heavily on scientific princi
ples. Michael Belie, in a recently
published book titled "Darwin's
Black Box: The Biochemical Chal
lenge to Evolution," argues that
complex life exhibits an "irreduca
bility" that precludes a Darwinian
explanation. One example Belie
seizes on is the mechanism of
blood-clotting in mammals. In his
estimation, removing any of the
various biochemical factors of
blood clotting destroys the entire
process, proving that the system
could not have involved naturally
by building one factor on top of
another, because the system only
works as a whole.
Ruse responds by pointing out
that there is "simply no evidence
tli.it organic characteristics are so
complex that they could not have
been produced by the evolution
ary process. Ruse further sug
gests that more primordial blood
clotting mechanisms could have
made use of other elements now
lost in present systems. When
enough of the required elements
for blood-clotting as we know
today were available, the new sys
tem emerged.
Turning to the "path" of evolu
tion, Ruse considers sc ienc e's pre
sent capabilities to trace the emer
gence ol evolution. While reiving
initially on the Ibssil record, evolu
tionary theon todav uses such evi
dence as the effect genetic ch ili of
genotypes to study the path of evo
lution. Still, critic ism ol the limita
tion ol the lossil record has been a
difficult charge to refute. Numer
ous gaps exist that more and more
appear unlikely to be filled. Ruse
admits that "here indeed we do
run into limits to our understand

ing." Si ill, ihc absence of some evi
dence does not invalidate the
sheer weight ol numerous other
forms of evidence. While "paths ol
evolution ... 111 practice ... [might
be] beyond the limitsol our tinder
standing,' this unfortunate fad
does not discredit the theory; it
merelv limits our inquirv in one
specific area.
Rising to a broader plane.
Ruse linallv considers the "caus
es" of evolution. I raditional the
ory holds that natural and sexual
selection, operating through ge
netics. is the nie( li.inisni ol evolu
tion. But Ruse admits "one can
not pretend that all is entirel)
smooth" regarding these theo
ries. Population genetics has
sometimes challenged the thcorv
on the basis of the randomness of
genetic drift, and some theories
suggest that sex itself shouldn't
be around because of "pressures
always favoring the individual."
Stephen |av (iould's famous thc
orv ol punctuated equilibrium,
that extreme natural changes
lead to spec iation. highlights the
limits ol extending natural selec
tion to the realm of macroenvi
roiimc nt.il changes.
Finally, Ruse examines a more
philosophical c hallenge to evolu

tion, one grounded in a mm lologi
cal explanation of science, lie
writes that "some commentators
... argue tli.it science is less a disin
terested objective reflection ol ...
independent realitv and more <i
subjective human-created social
(onst ruction."
Presumably, under anothci
social paradigm, evolutionarv
theon would be different; there
lore, lor si ience to selec i one "ex
planation" is arbitrarv. Indeed,
the social const rue lion of science
introduces fundamental limits lo
evolutionary thcorv as well.
These limits, according lo some,
should lorce examination and
skepticism of so cherished a be
lief as evolution.
I Htimatclv. these debates within
evolutionarv thcorv push biology
forward, forc ing scientists lo ques
tion assumptions and develop ever
more encompassing ideas. Still, like
am other scientific thcorv, evolu
tion can be neither right noi wrong
iu a traditional sense, onl\ a tool to
explain the natural world. Ihe
worth of the tool hinges not on ar
bitrary standards but on the succ ess
of its explanations. I'itv. then, that
public debate over evolution de
mands .in absolutism that nothing

Hie heated opinions regarding
evolution mask a sad fact: (Cultural
polarization about evolution pre
cludes a good deal ol scientific de
bate about the sped lies of evolu
tionary theory. To the mainstream
public, the debate over evolution
seems mired in a stand oil between
science and religion. But scientists
understand that evolution is just
like any scientific theory, open to
refinement, growth, change and
further explanation. However, a
nood deal of honest scientific de
bate regarding evolutionary theo
ry could be misconstrued as a chal
lenge to evolution itself, so scien
tists hide their debate from the
public.
A recent article by Dr. Michael
Ruse, "Limits to Our Knowledge
of Evolution," highlights some
particulars of this debate. Provoca
tive .is the title may be, Ruse is a an
admitted "traditional Darwinist."
He succinctly and objectively sur
vevs the current body of work di
rected towards the study of evolu
tion and examines the basis ol
some of the more persuasive ques
tions raised by the standard model
of evolution.
In keeping with the traditional
organization of evolutionary thco
r\. Ruse divides his discussion into

a distinction between the "fact" of
evolution, the "path" of evolution,
and the "theory or mechanisms"
of evolution.
In disc ussing the facts ol evolu
tion, Ruse refers to the original
Darwinian idea that all life lias de
scended from other, simpler
forms of lile that are propagated
through reproduction and subject
to natural constraints. Here Ruse
lias little patience for divergent
ideas; he points out that the collet -
live force of myriad different in
quiries, from lossil studies to em
bryology to genetic fingerprint
ing, all point conclusively to the
inter-relatedness of all life. Com
mon creationist criticisms of this
supposition center largely on con
fusion regarding the definition of
"theory," using the word in a cul
tural context such as," I have a the
ory about Kennedy's assassina
tion." rather than the scientific de
finition, Ruse writes.
But one line of criticism regard
ing evolutionary theory seems to
rely heavily on scientific princi
ples. Michael Belie, in a recently
published book titled "Darwin's
Black Box: The Biochemical Chal
lenge to Evolution," argues that
complex life exhibits an "irreduca
bility" that precludes a Darwinian
explanation. One example Belie
seizes on is the mechanism of
blood-clotting in mammals. In his
estimation, removing any of the
various biochemical factors of
blood clotting destroys the entire
process, proving that the system
could not have involved naturally
by building one factor on top of
another, because the system only
works as a whole.
Ruse responds by pointing out
that there is "simply no evidence
tli.it organic characteristics are so
complex that they could not have
been produced by the evolution
ary process. Ruse further sug
gests that more primordial blood
clotting mechanisms could have
made use of other elements now
lost in present systems. When
enough of the required elements
for blood-clotting as we know
today were available, the new sys
tem emerged.
Turning to the "path" of evolu
tion, Ruse considers sc ienc e's pre
sent capabilities to trace the emer
gence ol evolution. While reiving
initially on the Ibssil record, evolu
tionary theon todav uses such evi
dence as the effect genetic ch ili of
genotypes to study the path of evo
lution. Still, critic ism ol the limita
tion ol the lossil record has been a
difficult charge to refute. Numer
ous gaps exist that more and more
appear unlikely to be filled. Ruse
admits that "here indeed we do
run into limits to our understand

ing." Si ill, ihc absence of some evi
dence does not invalidate the
sheer weight ol numerous other
forms of evidence. While "paths ol
evolution ... 111 practice ... [might
be] beyond the limitsol our tinder
standing,' this unfortunate fad
does not discredit the theory; it
merelv limits our inquirv in one
specific area.
Rising to a broader plane.
Ruse linallv considers the "caus
es" of evolution. I raditional the
ory holds that natural and sexual
selection, operating through ge
netics. is the nie( li.inisni ol evolu
tion. But Ruse admits "one can
not pretend that all is entirel)
smooth" regarding these theo
ries. Population genetics has
sometimes challenged the thcorv
on the basis of the randomness of
genetic drift, and some theories
suggest that sex itself shouldn't
be around because of "pressures
always favoring the individual."
Stephen |av (iould's famous thc
orv ol punctuated equilibrium,
that extreme natural changes
lead to spec iation. highlights the
limits ol extending natural selec
tion to the realm of macroenvi
roiimc nt.il changes.
Finally, Ruse examines a more
philosophical c hallenge to evolu

tion, one grounded in a mm lologi
cal explanation of science, lie
writes that "some commentators
... argue tli.it science is less a disin
terested objective reflection ol ...
independent realitv and more <i
subjective human-created social
(onst ruction."
Presumably, under anothci
social paradigm, evolutionarv
theon would be different; there
lore, lor si ience to selec i one "ex
planation" is arbitrarv. Indeed,
the social const rue lion of science
introduces fundamental limits lo
evolutionary thcorv as well.
These limits, according lo some,
should lorce examination and
skepticism of so cherished a be
lief as evolution.
