# The 						Lost Cities of Abu Qir
## Discovery of Pharaonic cities hailed as the greatest marine archaelogical discovery in history 
### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
In June, archaeologists
working 111 Egypt stunned
the world with the discoven
of three Pharaonic cities
buried in these.i l<»i more
than a thousand years.
"It's the most exciting find
in the history ol marine ar
chaeology," (ialialla Ali (i.i
balla lold "Popular Science."
(iaballa is I lie secretary-gen
eral ol the Supreme (Council
of Antiquities, Egypt's top ar
chaeology body.
Indeed, both media and
scientists have hailed the dis
covery .is one of the greatest
of all times.
Geophysics Professor
Amos Nur, responsible lor
the magnetic mapping, was
more cautious in his re
marks, "The cities were not
intact - only the material
was."
However, he explained
that even this is very useful.
fhe ruins show evidence
of an earthquake. The les-

son, lie said, "is I hat collapse In subsidence
and earthquakes may be a common danger in
other parts ol the woi Id. for example, the Ba\
ofTokyo."
The cities were found in the Mediter
ranean seabed, about four miles from land in
the Hay of Abu C2'r. I he sites hold three dis
tinct cities— I lerakleion. also known as I bo
nis, ('.a nop us and Menouthis.
I lie cities were known only through (ireek
tragedies, travelogues and legends before the
monumental discovery. Authors such as
112 lerodolus, Straboand Senet <i also mentioned
them, but there had been no physical evident e

to substantiate their existence until now.
Nin explained win the cities were not
found earlier.
" I hey were buried under sill at the bottom
of the Bay of Abu Qir fin northern Kgypt |," lie
said. "We need magnetic and seismic equip
ment to delect the buried ruins." Such sophis
ticated equipment lus become cost-effective
only m the last lew years.
"The question now is, why did these cities
sink?" French archaeologist Franck (ioddio
told "Middle Fast limes" in June.
I lerakleion might offer the best answers,
(lompleteb buried beneath layers of sedi-

ment and mud, it was pro
tected from saltwater and
currents so the ruined hous
es. temples, giant statues and
port infrastructure were pre
served. Canopus is less ton
served and excavations of
Menouthis have not yet
begun.
All three (ities, each of which
had <i population ol between
3,000 and 5,000 people, went
into decline following the
founding of Alexandria,
which quickly became the re
gional trading powerhouse
after its founding in 331 B.C.
Still, the ( ities remained im
portant lor various cults, even
after the introduction of
Christianity. They disap
peared suddenly between the
eighth ,md tenth centuries.
According to Nur, earth
quakes might be responsible
for this disappearance.
"It appears that columns
and walls collapsed more or
less in the same direction."
This, he explained, is proba
bly sign of an earthquake.
I here is evidence of major

earthquakes during the third, fourth and
eighth centuries A.I). Nobody knows if it was
many small earthquakes or one giant cata
clysm thai destroyed the cities.
Another theory of destruction involves a
massive flood.
Fhe future might reveal more concrete an
swers. Meanwhile, collaboration with the
Egyptian government and funding from the
from the Kuropean I lilti Foundation give the
project vital support to continue excavations.
Indeed, the June discovery was the fiuit of
two long years of work in waters as deep as 30
feet - and there is still much farther to dig.
