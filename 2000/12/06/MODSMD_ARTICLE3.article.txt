## 
### DEENA SKOLNICK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Following the United Farm
Workers' decision Nov. 21 to can
cel its boycott of California table
grapes, University President John
Hennessy announced the end of
the University's grape vote.
"In addition, the educational
program administered by the Of
fice of the Dean of Students and
the ()ffice of Residential Education
will end," 1 fennessy said.
Prior to the release of this state
ment, Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs James Montoya met to discuss

the end of the boycott with Julie
Lythcott-1 112 aims, the president's as
sistant; other members of the ad
ministration; and student leaders,
including ASSU President Seth
Newton, ASSU Vice President
Malia Villegas and leaders of
MFChA, a Chicano/Latino stu
dent group which has been in
favor of the boycott.
"Many staff, faculty members
and students made a deep com
mitment to this issue," Montoya
said. "Before making a public
statement it was important that
these individuals and groups
have ihe opportunity to share
their thinking with the members
<>l the administration. - '
Sophomore Gabriela Rico, a
member of MK( lhA, said that the
group was in support of UFW's
decision to call off the boycott.
"The boycott was intended to
support the 1 F\V in iis campaign
to improve working conditions,
wages and benefits for its work
ers," she said.
"Since the UFYV lias with
drawn its support, MFGhA be
lieves that there is no further rea
son for the I Diversity to continue
the boycott."
"Ii would seem rather irra
tional to continue the boycott at
Stanford alter it's been ended 1))
the UFW," said junior Brian Ball.
Although student votes will
not be counted due to the end of
the bovcott, this year's vote shows
general student support for the
boycott — more than in recent
years.
"We did a better job in educa
tional outreach,'' said Dean of

Students Marc Wais. "Students
really raved about our Web page,
which was detailed, complete and
up to date. The Stanford Debate
(Hub also went to residences and
set up mock debates .... It was
ver) illuminating for people."
Montoya attributed the in
creased support for the boycott to
the efforts of MK(IhA.
Rico elaborated, "1 think that
this year we took new approach
towards campaigning. We tried
to present it to the University at
large as a human rights and
human dignity issue, because in
past been its looked upon as only
.1 (ilucano / Latino issue.
"We also did a lot with perfor
mance art in White Plaza," Rico
added. "We had a (10l lo event, a
poetry night .... I think we were
being very visual, and everyone
can relate to visual arts."
Ball has a different theory
about this year's vote.
"1 think a lot of people didn't
vote lot it because we've got a lot
of underclassmen who don't re
member when the boycott was a
big issue," he said. "The only peo
ple who voted were the ones who
were against the boycott.''
Rico added her concern that
now that the boycott is over, stu

dents will distance themselves
from labor issues and worker's
rights.
"We don't want the struggle ol
the farmers and hunger strikers
to be forgotten," she said.
"We're working on <t program
that has directly to do with orien
tation and will include labor is
sues or social justice issues. I lie
administration has been very
willing to work with us. We're
probably going to be meeting
with them next quarter .is well to
come up with a new education
program, something not related
to grapes."
The University has formally
ended all its educational pro
grams connected with the grapes
boycott.
"I want to encourage students
to continue an open dialogue in
their residences and other set
lings about issues that are impor
tant to them and society in gener
al," I lennessy said.
"Discussion on these impor
tant issues will not end," said
Montoya. "Residence halls are
the ideal place for tliese conversa
tions to take place."
Wais emphasized that these
new programs may not be as for
malized as they have been in tlu

past, because "there's not that
pressure [of a vote| . . . . Ii will be
much more open-ended.
" I his one particular legacy ol
this issue will live on through the
educational model," he added.
I he UFW ended its 16-year
boycott because, according to
UFW President Arturo Ro
driguez, most ol its goals have al
reacly been met.
Most ol the chemicals targeted
m the boycott have been banned
or their use lias been restric ted.
"Il is not lair to as our sup
porters to honor a boycott when
the union must devote all ol its
present resources toward orga
nizing and negotiating con
tracts," Rodriguez said in a state
ment.
Stanford has been holding a
grapes vote since 1 ( .M)4, when stu
dents initiated a hunger strike
demanding, among other things,
a University-wide boycott ol
grapes.
This led to the formation of a
Grape Policy Committee that
concluded that the entire I niver
sity should not boycott grapes but
should instead implement an an
nual vote by each of the dining
halls to decide whether or not to
serve grapes.
