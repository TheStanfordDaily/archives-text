## Visiting professors lecture on ancient perception of knowledge 
### ANDREW GUSTIN 
Kminent medievalists from around the
globe congregated at the (iraduate School
of Business beginning last Fhursday fora
tliree-da\ colloquium entitled " I he Me
dieval Senses."
I he apptoximatelv .SO scholars were in
vited b\ Comparative Literature Prof.
Hans I Irich (iumbrecht. I he collo({uium
was funded by the School of Humanities
and Sciences.
" The basic issue here was to find an ap
proach to see how the epistemology of the
Middle Ages was different," (iumbrecht
said. "How was knowledge produced, how
was knowledge structured, how would
knowledge circulate and so forth."
Medieval Kurope, (.iumbrecht said, was
"probablv more dillerent from modern cul
ture than, lor example, the culture of classi
cal antiquitv."
Specificallv, the conception of the senses
in medieval Kurope was drasticallv dillerent
from today's ideas. A basic law of moderni
ty, for instance, is that our accepted knowl
edge of reality must be empiric al, produced
by sensory data.
However, from the perspective of a
medieval Kuropean, said (iumbrecht, "all
knowledge you can really rely on has to
be revealed knowledge â€” revealed by
Cod. And that means all knowledge that's
produced b\ your senses can always be
deceptive."
Among the speakers were Howard
Bloch of Yale University, who presented
"The Animal .Appetites and the Senses";
Italian Literature Prof. Jelliey Schnapp,
who spoke about "Sweat"; and Joachim

Kiipper of the Free University of Berlin,
who presented"The Theological, the
Philosophical, and the Medical Discourse
on the Senses: Degrees of Congruence, De
grees of Divergence."
The colloquium's keynote speaker, Car
oline Walker Bynum of Columbia Univer
sity, presented"The Blood and the Bodies
of Christ in the Later Middle Ages: An
Asymmetry" last Thursday before a large
audience.
(iumbrec ht has known and worked with
a large core of the gathered scholars for
many years.
In 1991, he organized the group's first
colloquium, which brought scholars to Stan
lord to talk about medieval theatricality.
Since then, many of the same scholars have
gathered .it colloquia hosted by the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, Yale and Kuropean
universities.
Stephan Mueller, a lecturer at the Uni
versity of Dresden, was invited by (lum
brecht after they met at a recent confer
ence in Europe.
I lie opportunity was"a great chance to
meet the leading scientists from the U.S.A.
and Kurope and especially to be involved
as a young scientist," said Mueller, who
earned his doctoral degree two years ago.
Meg Worley, a doctoral student in Com
parative Literature, was one of two Stanford
students who presented.
"This is the lirst time I've been in such
an esteemed company of international
scholars," she said. "It was fascinating to
observe the different styles of scholarship,
both personal and institutional, and how
they conversed with each other."
"The thing that makes this colloquium
different," said Worley, "is the amount of
time left for discussion and the way that
participants are realb encouraged to en
gage with each other's work."
Wot ley's presentation was on "The Kx
hortatory Power ol Allegory."
