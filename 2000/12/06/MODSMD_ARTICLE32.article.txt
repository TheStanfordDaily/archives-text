.Vs winter quarter approaches, students perusing the Stan
lord Bulletin in search of interesting or unusual courses
should find a plethora of possibilities. Three ol Stanford's
most popular courses and an array ol'obscure introductory
seminars make winter quarter a good time lor students to
broaden their academic horizons.
Sleep and Dreams
Sleep and Dreams was the largest c lass at Stanlbrd last year,
enrolling more than 450 students. 1 aught In William De
ment, a professor ol psychiatry, the course is known lot being
both inlbrmative and entertaining, according to 1 lead I cach
ing Assistant Biren Kamdar.
Kamdar, a senior pursuing a coterminal degree in human
biology, also served as a teaching assistant iu the course last
year.
"The course is popular because it is unique and relevant to
every student," Kamdar said. "What college student doesn't
want to learn more about his / her own sleep?"
In addition to learning about topics relating to their own
sleep habits, such .is the ellects of sleep deprivation and ways
to lower sleep clebt, students will have the chance to learn
about sleep disorders, biological rhvthms, sleepwalking and
other relevant issues.
Dement employs everything from movies — plans are un
derway to feature a film clip of some sort during ever) class
meeting — and Web sites to basketball players and narcolep
tic clogs to present the material in lectures.
"We do everything we can to make the course interesting
and fun," Dement said. "This year. . . we are producing a
number of special video dips to depict, emphasize and make
memorable one of the class themes, 'drowsiness is red alert." "
By using engaging methods to impart what Dement calls
"absolutely essential knowledge," the course can even save its
students' lives.
"1 was in the Stanford Shopping (lenter a week ago and a
man who was with a little boy c ame up to me," Dement said.
"I Ie said, 'You won't remember me, but I took your course in

1991. Mv son ... was dving and I knew it was sleep apnea
even though our pediatrician didn't. When his tonsils were
taken out, he was cured."'
kamdar said that he expects enrollment numbers similar
to last year.
Sleep and 1 )reams isoflered winter quarter only and has no
prerequisites.
The American Dream
Political Sc ienc e (iO, or "1 he American Dream," is another
popular course that isoflered onh in winter quarter. Much ol
its appeal stems from the lad that it is one ol the few courses
that fulfill two general education requirements. 1 lie course
examines ihc american dream from the perspective of
women, minorities, Indians and immigrants.
I lie course has been the subject of controversy due to what


SUNDEEP BHAT/The Stanford Daily
junior Brent Villalobos calls a "Marxist view
of the american dream. At times in last year's
(lass, said Villalobos, "the led ure served more
as a propaganda speech about the wrongs of
American society. However, Villalobos said
that "the reading is interesting" and he en
joyed the "chance to look at various social and
economic issues in a completely diflerent
I'tfl'i-"
Political Science f>() is descrilied in the Bul
letin as "introductory." and it is reputedly a
good course lor non-majors, with a reason
able workload.
Introduction to Psychology
While Psvchologv 1 is offered .ill three quar
ters, the winter-quartet class taught by Dr.
Philip Zimbardo, .1 psycholog\ professor, is b\
litr the most popular. As just-elected head of
the American Psychological Association and
writer of the oldest psychology textbook in
print, Zimbardo has a reputation as one of
Stanford's great professors. Please see the re
lated story on page Al5.
Slips of the Tongue
()ne of the quarter's more esoteric: sopho
more seminars, "Slips of the I ongue" locuses
on a narrow topic in order to explore broad
themes. By studying the ways in which people
inadvertently mangle the language, students
explore the structure of language and the
iognitive process involved in using it.
"You c an figure out a lot about how things
woi k In seeing how iliey go wrong," said Dr.
\rnold Zwickv, a visiting professor in linguis
tics who teaches the seminar. "I hope [stu
dents who take the class] will appreciate just
how complex and organized languages are,
jusi how much speakers know, mostly without
being aware of it, about the languages they
speak."
Zwic kv taught about linguistic mishaps at
Man kind and ()hio State belore coming to
Stanford.

Understanding the Sixties
Understanding the Sixties is a freshman
seminar in which instructoi Douglas
VltAdam, a professor of semiology. puts the
H)(i()s in perspective with regard to the pie
ceding decades.
"I decided to teach [the course] because
students in other courses continued to display
an amazingly romanticized and a histoiical
understanding ol one of the most important
and consequential periods in U.S. history,
said McAdam. "The course is not really so
much on the 00s as the events and fac
tors... that shaped the era and the [eras)
contemporary legacies.
While some students disagreed that the
'(i()s are over-romanticized, most said that
they agreed with the idea th.it the media dis
torts people's impressions of the decade and
would he interested in learning more about
the subject.
From Vampires to Cannibals; or, How to
Consume the Other
Perhaps the most unusually titled fresh
man seminar is "From Vampires to Canni
bals; or, 1 low to Consume the ()ther."
Associate English Prof. Dr. Denise Ci
game, the courses instructor, has re
searched the topic and written books relat
ing to appetite and its societal implications
Said Cigante, "1 hope students will use
the topic of eating/drinking the other t<
think critically about some of our most Inn
damental categories of understanding: in
side / outside, self/ other, savage / civi
lized. animal / human, living / dead."
Students seem to think the idea is in
triguing, but many said that it has too litll<
bearing on their other academic endeavors
"Being premed, 1 don't think 1 woul<
have any use for this course," freshmai
Dave Cuo said.
"ft seems like it would be interesting bu
kind of weird."
"1 think it sounds interesting; I've al
ways had dreams about being chased dowi
by a vampire," said Jordan Lee, a fresh
man. "Plus I have inverted vampire teeth.
