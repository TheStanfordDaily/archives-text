.Vs winter quarter approaches, students perusing the Stan
lord Bulletin in search of interesting or unusual courses
should find a plethora of possibilities. Three ol Stanford's
most popular courses and an array ol'obscure introductory
seminars make winter quarter a good time lor students to
broaden their academic horizons.
Sleep and Dreams
Sleep and Dreams was the largest c lass at Stanlbrd last year,
enrolling more than 450 students. 1 aught In William De
ment, a professor ol psychiatry, the course is known lot being
both inlbrmative and entertaining, according to 1 lead I cach
ing Assistant Biren Kamdar.
Kamdar, a senior pursuing a coterminal degree in human
biology, also served as a teaching assistant iu the course last
year.
"The course is popular because it is unique and relevant to
every student," Kamdar said. "What college student doesn't
want to learn more about his / her own sleep?"
In addition to learning about topics relating to their own
sleep habits, such .is the ellects of sleep deprivation and ways
to lower sleep clebt, students will have the chance to learn
about sleep disorders, biological rhvthms, sleepwalking and
other relevant issues.
Dement employs everything from movies — plans are un

meeting — and Web sites to basketball players and narcolep
tic clogs to present the material in lectures.
"We do everything we can to make the course interesting
and fun," Dement said. "This year. . . we are producing a
number of special video dips to depict, emphasize and make
memorable one of the class themes, 'drowsiness is red alert." "
By using engaging methods to impart what Dement calls
"absolutely essential knowledge," the course can even save its
students' lives.
"1 was in the Stanford Shopping (lenter a week ago and a
man who was with a little boy c ame up to me," Dement said.
"I Ie said, 'You won't remember me, but I took your course in

1991. Mv son ... was dving and I knew it was sleep apnea
even though our pediatrician didn't. When his tonsils were
taken out, he was cured."'
kamdar said that he expects enrollment numbers similar
to last year.
Sleep and 1 )reams isoflered winter quarter only and has no
prerequisites.
The American Dream
Political Sc ienc e (iO, or "1 he American Dream," is another
popular course that isoflered onh in winter quarter. Much ol
its appeal stems from the lad that it is one ol the few courses
