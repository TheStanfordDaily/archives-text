junior Angela kang treated the group

two years ago. Last year was its first year as
an official Stanford student group.
"When | Kang] first came to Stanford, she
went to go talk to the homeless in downtown
Palo Alto," Cheng said. "She was originally
hoping to find out what kinds of services
and material goods she could try to get for
them, but one thing she heard over and
over again was the need for something as
simple as friendship and respect."
Cobb joined Night ()utreach because of a
similar interest.
"I got interested in homeless issues in this
area and just happened to find the Night
()utreach group," she said.
Cheng and current president Patricia
Soung, also .1 senior, joined the group after
an experience with the homeless on Alter
native Spring Break.
"As I was gathering information about
the homeless, 1 wanted to get first-hand ex
posure to it .incl get first-hand experience,"
Soung said.
"I went 011 the homelessness in the Bay
Area ASK trip and began to feel a real pas
sion for working with the poor and under
privileged," (llieng said.
All four members said the organization
fulfills lis purpose of forming close relation
ships with the homeless.
"One of the guys we know died a couple
weeks ago," Cheng remembered. "Al
though this isn't someone I saw all the time,
1 know iliai i felt like I had lost a friend, and
all of our volunteers who had ever met him
felt the same way. The friendships are real
and have a lasting impact."
