other events during the break for
students who do not leave campus.
Mauri/io Battaglio, a resident
host at the Bechtel Center, said,
"We hope to provide a family-like
environment for students who
cannot go home, so they don't feel
lonely on Christmas or New
Year's."
Two to four undergraduate siu
dents can live in the Bechtel Cen
ter over break. In return, they
musl help plan programs at the
Center.
So far, two people have signed
up lor the free lodging. They start
ed training yesterday, but
Battaglio said that they are still
looking for more lodgers.
The other students who remain
on campus, whether undergradu
ate or graduate, American or in
ternational, will attend the differ
ent programs that these students
coordinate.
"Everyone is welcome," said
Battaglio. "Everything we offer is,
most of the time, free or almost
free, and open to everybody."
Most undergraduate dormito
ries are closed over winter break,
and many international students
who cannot afford to go home
complain that Stanford does not
accommodate them well enough.
Sophomore Sunaina Sinha, presi
dent of the International Under
graduate Committee, is an inter
national student who will be going
home.

"One of the big pushes of the
f.l .C. is to make Stanford more
accommodating lot international
students," Sinha s.utl. She thinks
Stanford should follow the lead of
the I niversitv of Pennsylvania,
which keeps its undergraduate
dormitories open over winter
break.
Todd Benson, manager of
Housing Assignment Services,
said a major reason why dormito
ries are not kept open is security.
Stanford tried to keep residences
open in the past, but, with few
people staving on campus, thefts
were common. Also, by closing
most undergraduate residences
over the break, students rents are
lowered.
Some dormitories do remain
open, including Chi Theta Chi,
Crothers 1 fall, (.rothers Memori
al Hall, Escondido Village, Ham
marskjold, Evtnan Hall, Rains
Houses, Sc hwab Residential Cen
ter and Sigma (llii.
Stanford suggests that students
who cannot afford to go home sta\
with a friend, rent a hotel room or
try to sta\ with somebody in one of
the dormitories that will remain
open.
"Without am real help from the
University, we have to lend for our
selves," said Mur.id Akhter, a se
nior from Pakistan. "That's kind ol
harsh. Bechtel is u \ ing to help out."
