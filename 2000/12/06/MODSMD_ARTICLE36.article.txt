While most kids only imagine joining the army, pi
loting jet planes and working on snbmarienes, several
Stanlord students are currently preparing lor military
service through ROTC, or Reserve Officers Training
("orps.
llu- tour-year ROTO program trains students in
basic militarx protocol. Students apply during their se
nior yearol high school through a lbrm that is separate
from college applications.
('.ancliclates list their top choice in schools so R() 1(1
can allot students to each campus. Students can opt to
enter an ROTC. program with an emphasis on the
Arnix, the Navy or the Air Force.
R( )T( • acti\ities do not ailed a student's daih lite,
except on I hursdays. because there is not a sulli
cient number of participants at Stanlord to warrant
a program here, students in R()T('. drive an hour to
I (I-Berkeley.
1 lie R( )TC students leave at noon. When they arrive
at Berkeley, thev c hange into unilbrni and then work on
paperwork or other small jobs. Training begins at 2
p.m. With students from I'('.-Berkeley, UC-Davis and
the ('.alilbrnia Maritime Academy, the students partici
pate in a vat ielv ol activities, including practicing drills,
unilbrm inspections and lectures.
" I lie thine 1 like most about drill time is that we have

guest speakers who talk to us alxmt various issues." said
junior I lanev I long, a panic ipant in the Naval l« ) 1 (
program.
Some recent lecturers include a commander who
spokealxnit Southeastern Asian allairs. ()ther speakers
have talked about their experience in ROTC. living
planes and piloting submarines.
Following training, R( )TC students eat dinner .it a
c ale in Berkelex. Classes begin .it 10 p.m. Depending
on their year in school, participants take classes such .is
naval engineering, phxsics and other topics relating to
RC )TC. Students return to Stanlord at 9 p.m.
Although Stanford students do not receive a< ademic
credit tor joining R()T('., there are several other Ilenelits.
i R( )T('. pays for lour xears ol college education and,
because students are expect eel to serve in the arm) after
they leave college, it guarantees a job to students after
cc >llege.
"Nearly all students [at Stanlord] receixe a scholar
) ship that pays lull tuition, lees, a $200 per month
stipend and books. After graduation one must serxe on
active duty lor at least four xears."' said Nathan 1 .tilher,
the battalion commanding ollicer ol the Naval ROIC
unit at UC-Berkelcy.
t Because ROTC. participants are part ol the
) armed forces, they receixe training in leadership
and organization.
"It teaches xou a lot about dedication, discipline and
i lime management, said freshman Michael Neruda, a
member of the Navy R() IC.
I In exchange lot these benefits, time < oniniiunent is
probably the biggest sacrifice inxolxecl in ROIC. Be
