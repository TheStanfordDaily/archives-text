### BILL BOWEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Senior Mike lerneoy has created a new
Web site t ailed whiteplaza.com that oilers
students services ranging l'rom online
book trading to carpool inlbrmation tor
rides to Lake lahoe. 1 lie Web site will
serve as an alterative to mass e-mails and
crowded bulletin boards to know what's
going on on campus.
('.urrentlv whiteplaza.com is unfamiliar
to most students, but I crneoy is confident
ili.it as more students become aware ol the
siie, it will become .in effective tool to help
meet their needs.

l lii' idea of using a Web site tobm and
sell used textbooks is not entireK new. Sev
eral student groups in the | Â».isi have orga
nized student textbook exchanges to avoid
paying what many students see as exorbi
tantly high used textbook prices at the
Stanibrd Bookstore.
"1 think it's a realh good idea, because
ordinarily vou get almost nothing on used
books if you sell them back to the book
store," said sophomore Meredith Brown.
"Then you have to pa\ a high mark-up
price to buv used books lor youi other
classes."
The Web site is organized by depart
ment, and students will be able to post no

tices to bu\ or sell used textbooks on the
message boards lor each departments
page.
However, the textbook market is <>nl\
one of the In in lions ol 1 erneo\ 's Web site.
I'he site .ilso oilers a message board for
auctions tluit "organizes items under
subtopics such as used cars, apartments,
stereos and tickets," lerneoy explained.
()thei messaging boards include a "lost
and Ibund" section and a section called
" I ahoe news" to let students exchange in
lbrmation and make plans lor weekend ski
trips.
lerneoy primarily aimed to give stu
dents a \\a\ to know what s going on at

Stanibrd in and outside ol ( kiss.
"I want ni\ audience to advertise cam
pus parlies on iliis Web site so iliat every
one on campus can scope out the scene lor
the entire week," lei neoy said. "Ifyou are
planning a parl\ ol anv si/e, ii can be seen
In the whole community, even il it'sjust in
your room with a few ol your friends."
Another goal l erneox had in creating
the siie was to allow students to Ibrm study
groups lor their classes il iliev don't al
read\ have them set up. I le hopes this w ill
give students wavs to make studving more
so< ial and enjovable.
lerneo\ recognizes that bulletin
boards and e-mail lists alreadx exist to help

students tind the information available on
whiteplaza.com, but bt- hopes the Web site
will be helpful in ollering all these services
in one easilv accessible location.
"U would be sort ola one-stop shop
ping deal, said senioi |ell (iable.' It has a
lot of dillerent topics in one place."
Though many students thought the
proposed site was a good idea, many ex
pressed skepticism as to whether the\
would actually make use ol it.
I heonh problem is that students keep
trying to do these schemes, and it never
seems to work," senior Krica Piatt com
mented. "When it does work, 1 guess it sa
good idea, but I haven't seen ii work vet."
