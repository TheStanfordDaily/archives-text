Sometimes when you win, you really lose.
Freshman swimmer lara Kirk found that
out the hard way this weekend as the
women's swimming and diving team finished
second at the Fexas Invitational despite the
newcomer's two individual victories.
The Cardinal led the three-day event by
lf> points over second-place lexas, the host
school, after two days of competition. Stan
lord extended its lead to 21 points with I (ILA
holding third during Sunday's finale.
I lowever, a solid Bruin surge over the last
several rac es on Sunday forced the Cardinal
to settle lor second place with 529.5 points, 24
short of UClA's w inning total.
I he depth of the Bruin roster proved
deadly lot the remaining schools that chal
lenged for the Fexas Invitational title. UCLA
swimmers and divers failed to garner a single
first-place finish on Sunday, but its overall
team strength put enough points on the
board to capture the meet.
Kirk did her part lor the Cardinal, first
taking the 100-meter breaststroke on Satur
day in an NCAA "A" qualifying standard time
of 1:00.92, although she posted a better time
during preliminary heats.

Though competing in her first official col
legiate meet, kirk put herself among the elite
with an impressive win in Sunday's 200-
meter breaststroke, this time in 2:12.24, an
other NCAA qualifying time.
Kirk was not alone in her impressive
run in Austin over the weekend. Junior
Jessica Foschi got Stanford off and kit king
on Friday with a win in the 500-meter
freestyle finals.
Senior Misty Hyman, of Sydney Olympic
fame, finished second in the 400-meter indi
vidual medley on Saturday, coming just .17
seconds behind Arizona's Sarah Tolar
(4:13.12).
Apparently acquiring a flair for the dra
matic during her Australian travels, Hyman
provided an exciting encore on Sunday, fin
ishingjust .40 seconds short of the top spot in
the 200-meter butterfly. Both of Flyman's sec
ond-place times met NCAA "A" qualifying
standards.
In the three-day diving competition, Stan
ford's athletes dominated. The top three plat
form scorers were Cardinal upperclassmen,
with senior Erin Sones claiming victory with a
new meet record 438.30 points. Juniors
Mc kcnze Murphy and Alexis Sowa rounded
out the top three with scores of 434.75 and
373.55.
