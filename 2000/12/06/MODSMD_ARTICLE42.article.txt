# Bruins' misery continues in L.A.
## 
### 
Georgia Tech 72, UCLA 67: On Sat
urday in Anaheim, Calif'., Georgia Tech
defeated UCLA in the first game of the
seventh-annual John Wooden Classic in
Anaheim, dropping the Bruins to 2-3. In
an ugly game from start to finish, the
Bruins proved to be the sloppier team in

PAC-10 ROUNDUP

the end, shooting a ridiculously low 28
percent from the field while committing
18 turnovers.
Even though UCLA held Georgia
Tech's leading scorer, Alvin Jones (18.5
ppg), to a season-low five points, the
Bruin defense could not handle the rest
of the Yellow Jackets, projected to be one
of the worst teams in the ACC. UCLA
missed its first 14 shots of the game but
still led at halftime 28-22.
Georgia Tech stormed back in the sec
ond half to win, shooting 56 percent
against the Bruins' lackadaisical defense.
Sophomore Jason Kapono led the Bru
ins with 18 points, despite shooting only
2-of-10 from the field. Point guard Earl
Watson added 16 points, but his eight
turnovers, compared to only three as
sists, killed the Bruins.
USC 65, Utah 60: In the second game
of the Wooden Classic, a resurgent and
almost healthy USC team took care of
Utah, sans injured head coach Rick Ma
jerus, 65-60. The win kept the high-fly
ing Trojans undefeated (4-0) and
pushed them up to No. 12 in the latest AP
rankings. The Utes (4-2) dropped to No.
22 with the loss.
The Trojans were led by senior for
ward Brian Scalabrine's 18 points and ju
nior David Blumenthal's 16 points and
12 rebounds as the Trojan frontcourt
outscored the Utes, 46-22. USC's leading
scorer, center Sam Clancy, chipped in 12
points and 10 rebounds in a balanced ef
fort for the Trojans.
USC connected on 10-of-20 three
point attempts, including four three -
pointers apiece from Scalabrine and Blu
menthal and withstood the absence of
swingman Jell Trepagnier to defeat a
ranked nonconference opponent for the
first time in five years. USC put the game
out of reach with a 10-0 run that gave the
Trojans a 62-49 lead with 3:49 remain

ing. Junior Brandon Granville sealed the
victory with two late free throws.
Utah, which had only one starter
score in double-figures, could get noth
ing going offensively the entire game,
shooting 36 percent as a team from the
field. Majerus, who is recovering from
knee surgery, will rejoin the team in Jan
uary.
Arizona 101, Gonzaga 87: In Ari
zona's home opener on Wednesday, the
Wildcats (5-1) defeated the perennial
Cinderella team, Gonzaga, 101-87, be
hind a balanced attack that included five
scorers in double figures. The Zags (4-
1) played the No. 5 Wildcats tough,
leading 76-71 with 7:42 remaining, but
could not counter the loss of their top
player, Casey Calvary, who fouled out
with the game tied at 80 and five min
utes remaining.
Arizona pulled away late, capitalizing
on sharp shooting from the free-throw
line, hitting 34-of-39 shots for the game.
Michael Wright paced the Wildcats with
25 points, but he was by no means the
game's only star. Gilbert Arenas, coming
off the bench because of a pulled calf
muscle, managed to score 21 points and
Richard Jefferson dropped in 20 points
along with eight rebounds and seven as
sists. Luke W'alton, roaming the pivot in
place of suspended Loren Woods,
chipped in 10 points, nine rebounds, and
seven assists, in an outstanding team of
fensive display.
However, Arizona did not look good
on defense, allowing the Zags to shoot 52
percent from the field and 48 percent
from three-point land. Freshman guard
Blake Stepp dropped 21 points on Ari
zona's highly touted backcourt as Gonza
ga somehow surprised the Wildcats be
hind the Zags' patented outside attack.
The Skinny: This past week's play in the
Pac-10 was marked by the continuing
rise of USC and the downward spiral of
UCLA. The Trojans came up with a huge
win against Utah, winning again without
suspended star Jeff Trepagnier. Their
expectations are increasing by the game,
as they already look prepared to chal
lenge Arizona and Stanford for the con
ference title. Meanwhile, UCLA contin
ued its atrocious play, losing to its second

unranked opponent in as many weeks.
Nothing better manifests the different
directions that L'SC and UCLA are head
ing than the contrasting play of their two
point guards, USC's Brandon Granville
and UCLA's Earl Watson. Both players
are averaging more than seven assists per
game, but Watson has also averaged 4.2
turnovers per game compared to
Granville's 2.0. Watson notched eight
turnovers in this week's loss to Georgia
Tech and seven in last week's loss to Gal
State-Northridge.
Watson's inconsistencies have been a
factor in the Bruins' early season strug
gles, especially in today's world of college
basketball where teams depend so heavi
ly on their point guards. Almost every
one of the past decade's national champi
onship teams had an extremely reliable
point guard that ran the show effectively
(Mateen Cleaves, Khalid El-Amin, Tony
Delk, Tyus Edney, Bobby Hurley, etc.) at
a time when dominant big men have
been scarce. For UCLA to have any shot
at turning around its season, let alone
contend for the Pac-10, Watson's play
must come around. The Bruins are a tal
ented, highly athletic team, but they are
playing well under their potential in the
early season.
Meanwhile, Arizona showed again
this week that the team is capable of bat
tling adversity by beating another quality
opponent without its star, Loren Woods.
The Wildcats will have Woods (and prob
ably the recently suspended Richard Jef
ferson) back for Saturday's showdown
with I'Mh-ranked Connecticut. If so, that
would be the first time all season that the
Wildcats are at full strength. Arizona still
has the confidence of a No. 1 team but,
after a loss to Purdue proved emphatical
ly that talk of'the greatest team ever" was
at least four months premature, Con
necicut will be a test for the Wildcats,
even with Woods.
Other than USC, the most surprising
team so far in the Pac-10 has been Ore
gon, which is off to its best start (5-0) in
four years. Beating Massachusetts and
Portland this past week, the Ducks have
looked much stronger than expected, led
by senior Bryan Bracey's 17.5 points and
7.6 rebounds per game.
