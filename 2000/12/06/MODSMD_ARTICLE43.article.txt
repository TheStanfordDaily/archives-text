Like most Stanford students
during Dead Week, the Cardinal
wrestlers are busy preparing for
upcoming tests.
But instead of sharpening pen
cils, they've been sharpening their
skills on the mats at the Cliff Keen
Las Vegas Invitational. And after
most students put clown their cal
culators and examination books,
the wrestlers will face more tests in
winter break tournaments.
"Every match and tournament
we wrestle in is like a reading as
signment or a lecture, while the
Pacific 10 and the NCAA tourna
ments are the final exam on which
your entire grade for the class is
based," said assistant coach Jay
Jackson. "While the reading as
signments and lectures will help
prepare you for the final, they
don't mean a thing when it comes

to your final grade."
The Las Vegas Invitational is
one of the premier wrestling tour
naments in the country, drawing
more than 50 teams. This year's
field looked like a preview of the
N( IAA championships.
It included four top-10 pro
grams â€” fifth-ranked Illinois,
sixth-ranked Nebraska, seventh
ranked Michigan and eighth
ranked Lehigh. With every Pac-10
program competing in the tourna
ment, it was a good early-season
look at how conference competi
tion will play out.
Stanford had trouble facing
ranked opponents from strong
squads. Overall, the Cardinal's
combined record for the tourna
ment was 9-20.
However, any competition be
tween teams was strictly unofficial
in the individual format of the
tournament. While this week
end's results have no effect on the

Cardinal's overall record or end
of-ihe-year run, according to
Jackson, tlie tournament was "es
pecially important to compete in
because, with the large number of
teams and the quality of the com
petition, ii is so similar to the year
end tournaments."
Assistant coach Steve Buddie
described the tournament as an
early-season test lor his squad.
" Those who have lolty goals use*
this tournament as a guide lor
what they need to be doing in
order to peak by the end of the
wrestling season," Buddie said.
Redshirt sophomores Harold
Benson and Justin Walker stepped
up tor the Cardinal with big per
formances this weekend.
"Both ol these wrestlers have
been strong throughout the sea
son thus liir are establishing them
selves as team leaders," Jackson
said. "Both are hard workers and
tenacious competitors. They will

only improve as time goes on."
Walker went 3-2 in the tour
nament with one pin in the Im
pound weight class. Wrestling in
the 184-pound weight class,
Penson went 2-2 on the tourna
ment, losing to the eventual
champion. Freshman Paul
Gross went 2-2 in the 141-
pound weight class, with both of
his wins coming on pins.
Despite the program's unim
pressive record this weekend,
Jackson hopes that his squad will
gain experience throughout the
season and be competitive in the
Pac-10.
"Admittedly, we are a very
young and inexperienced team
right now," Jackson said. "I lowev
er, competing in these high-quali
ty tournaments gives our athletes
the experience they are currently
lacking so that, In the Pac-10 tour
nament, we will be an experienced
team.

"This team is improving with
every competition, and we will con
tinue to get better and peak for the
etld-c>l-1 he-seasc >n tournaments.''
For now, the (Cardinal wrestlers

will build their resumes in early
season tournament competition.
Next on tap for the Stanford squad
is tlio Reno Tournament of (cham
pions on Dec. 20 in Reno, Nev.

Weikel-Magden in the Las Vegas Invitational. Weikel-Magden, wrestling in
the 141 -pound weight class, finished last season with an 11 -9 record.
