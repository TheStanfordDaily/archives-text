# Heavyweight Selby skips gridiron to hit the mats
## 
### JIMMY WU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It was one of the most difficult deci
sions of his life: whether to trade in the
rigors and time commitment that Stan
ford football commands for the equally
demanding, but less time-intensive sport
of wrestling.
But junior heavyweight Brad Selby
eventually found the strength to take up
this challenge of becoming a competitor
on the mat instead of on the football field.
"It boiled down to me wanting more
time, because I started to get into acade
mics hard-core, and I really started to
enjoy Stanford for what it is known for,"
Selby said.
As Selby became more involved with
his academic work at Stanford, he real
ized that the grueling hours of football
practice and the overwhelming commit
ment that the season entailed would hin
der his vision of a Stanford double major
in English and art history.
"Football was very intense and very
scary for me because there were a lot of
expectations from my coaches, the peo
ple back at home, and from myself," ad
mitted Selby. "After the Rose Bowl sea
son, I decided I needed to do something
that I really enjoy."
In wrestling, Selby found a happy
medium. The sport was certainly not new
to him; Selby was the Arizona state cham
pion as a senior in the 275-pound heavy
weight division while attending Saguaro
High School in Scottsdale, Ariz. His
record that year was 40-1.
"Wrestling was something 1 simply
went out and did and enjoyed greatly,"
he said.
After two years on the Stanford foot
ball team, Selby decided that his body
would no longer be able to withstand the

time that football required without hav
ing to sacrifice his academic life.
"I just became so worn out with loot
ball," said Selby. "I knew that 1 would not
be able to [concentrate on my majors as
much] with the time that football re
quired. Since I didn't want to sell myself
or my teammates short, I decided to
wrestle full-time, a week after [last foot
ball season]."
Selby was a budding star in both sports
at Saguaro. But he always dreamt of play
ing football at Stanford and couldn't pass
up a full scholarship on the (lardinal foot
ball team.
I le was a backup offensive lineman for
two years, waiting behind such Stanford
luminaries as Mike McLaughlin and Jell
Cronshagen, before he began to debate
the possibility of a change. He admitted
to contemplating his future as a student
and athlete at Stanford during that time,
but emphasized that he was in complete
concentration throughout the football
season.
But in making the transition, he was
faced with the prospect of losing his
scholarship and the probability of an un
happy father. I lowever, Selby was able to
make what he claimed to be a difficult but
correct decision with lots of guidance.
"My high school coaches, | Randy Bish
op and Walt Favre] have been great in
helping with my decision. My father was
a hard-core Stanford football fan, and lie
was initially not pleased with my decision,
but now he really supports me," Selby
said. "|Mv coaches] told me to take ad
vantage of Stanford, because it is the most
unique place to be."
Selby took these words to heart and
decided that the daily time-commitment
tradeoff from loot ball to wrestling was too
good to pass up.
"What really spurred my decision

was the strong academic'quarter I man
aged to have while wrestling in the win
ter Iquarter]," he said. "Alter that, I
knew wrestling was <i better decision lot
me as far as the way I operate in the
classroom."
The transition has been fairly smooth.

the football and wrestling coaches and
