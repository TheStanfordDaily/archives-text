# Students await election results
## 
### JEFFREY TAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The 2000 presidential elec
tion had all the makings of a sus
pense thriller — nearly a month
after the election, the winning
candidate is still unknown. Is it
Texas Gov. George VV. Bush,
who is already busily preparing
his presidential transition team,
or is it Vice President A1 Gore,
whose lawyers will he arguing
their final appeal fora hand re
count to the Florida Supreme

Court tomorrow?
Thomas Grey, a law professor
and a former clerk to the late U.S.
Supreme Court Justice Thur
good Marshall, said, "The case on
the election contest has gone
against Core on grounds the
Florida Supreme Court is unlike
ly to reverse, and that is probably
i he end of the matter."
Bob McCrew, a junior and ed
itor in chief of the Stanford Re
view, confidently said, "1 think
the election's over and George
Bush won."

Not so, according Krista
Glaser, a senior and chair of Stan
ford Democrats.
"It's liustrating not to have clo
sure and know who has won," she
said. "But, I'd prefer waiting in
order to ensure that we have a fair
and accurate result. The Republi
cans should stop proclaiming vic
tory before a winner is decided."
Jefferson Eppler, a junior and
treasurer of Stanford Republi
cans. criticized the ongoing litiga
lion. He said, "It seems unfair
given ihe Democratic Party's
mantra of counting every vole to
locus on those 14.000 votes."
Are Stanford students sick of
the election drama yet? Fre s h -
man Nick Williams said he is:
"I'm very tired, it's been very
drawn out." Referring to the (in -
tent light in the courts over who
won the election, Williams stated,
"I have very ambivalent feelings
towards it; the law's been applied
very clumsily."
Megan Root, another fresh
man, agreed that the process has
lasted a long time, but prefaced
that opinion by saying, "I'd
rather they be confident in who
they choose."
II Bush does win the election,
it seems likely that he will face a
divided Congress and an elec
torate that may not see him as
being the legitimate president
considering he lost the popular

vote. But Gore has stated that if
the court process goes against
him in the end, he will be willing
to support Bush as president.
Ali Reichenthal, a freshman,
expressed those same sentiments.
"It seems a little hard to sup
port Bush as president, but once
lie becomes president, that's it,"
she said.
Cilaser, though, remains confi
dent that this will never happen.
"[The Stanford Democrats] be
lieve that if every vote that was
cast on Nov. 7 is counted, then
the true preference of Florida
voters means Gore is our next
President," she said.
"If this does not happen, sure
ly we are dealing with an illegiti
mate process."
On Monday, the U.S.
Supreme Gourt ruled to send
back to the Florida Supreme
Gourt for clarification an earlier
ruling to extend the Florida elec
tion certification deadline a week
beyond what it was originally.
Grey commented, "It wasn't
what I predicted, but it was a
clever stroke to avoid what other

wise might have been a 5-4 deci
sion along partisan lines.
"They really didn't reach any
conclusions, which is why they
were able to agree on the opin
ion."
Grey said he would like to see
the electoral college abolished as
the country's method for electing
the president.
"I would favor adopting direct
national popular election of the
President, but I think there is al
most no chance of such a consti
tutional amendment being
adopted," he said.
"It requires three-fourths of
the states to ratify, and too many
small states benefit from the Elec
toral College to make that feasi
ble," he said.
With a decision expected from
the Florida Supreme Court with
in days, it seems probable that the
election is finally close to an end.
So it looks like after about a
month of waiting and watching
CNN for the latest developments,
we should soon know who will be
the 43rd president of the United
States of America.
