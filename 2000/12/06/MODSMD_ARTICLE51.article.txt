"I thought we would handle ilie

Bui b\ the time [UMass] started
pressing, we didn't have our best
press-breaking lineup. I'm glad
I Mass explc>ited that, because now
we recognize that we have to do bel
ter."
Ihe lii si 15 minutes of the game
looked like a (lardinal shooting
clinic, as Stanford jumped out to an
early lead on 11-01-17 shooting.
Freshman Nicole Powell stal led the
attack, chipping in ilie first five
points of the game on route to a
team-high 13-point performance.
Junior Lauren St. (Hair, who led
the nation in three-point shooting
percentage last season, lound her
touch alter going scoreless in the
previous two games. St. (Hair
drained her lirst three-pointer just
lour minutes into the game, and
prem ceded to shoot l-< >1-7 from be
hind ilie arc lor the night to finish
with 12 points.

()n the other hand, UMass hada
dismal lirst half offensively. Despite
a valiant client from senior point
guard kathy (loyner, the young
Minutewomen had trouble finding
the net. I lie team missed 13 of their
lirst 15 attempts from the lloor and
seemed overwhelmed by Stan
lord's size and physical play.
The game's premiere matchup
look place in the paint, where ju
nior Bethany Donaphin put in a
hard day's work in the blocks to
quiet UMass star |enniler Butler.
Butler c ante into the game leading
the Minutewomen with an average
of 1.3.2 points a night. Under the
defensive pressure from Donaphin
and the towering arms ol senior
(larolyn Moos and junior (lori En
gliusen, Butler put up just seven
points off of hei 17 shots from the
lloor.
lu the backcourt, freshman
Susan King had another solid per
formance .is the (lardinal's starting
point guard, king looked confident
running the offense and kepi the
ball swinging around the perimeter
,ind into the hands of Stanford's
Iluee-point bomb squad.
According to VanDerveer, king
and Powell have adjusted well to
their roles in the starting lineup
after sophomore Jamie (larey's re
tirement.
"[Losing darey] has been a big
adjustment," VanDerveer said.
| Bui | our guard play is good, and
the team is getting used to Susan
and Nicole. Also, I like plaving a big
"2" guard, which Nicole gives us."
I )espiie <i siring ol errors I breed
In I Mass's press, Stanford look a
31-21 lead into the locker room at
halltime. 112 ilings didn't get am bet
ter lor the Minutewomen. While
(loyner tried to pull her team up
liom iis stagnant start, Stanlord
built and maintained a 20-point
lead throughout the last 12 minutes
ol the second hall.
The (lardinal used a sweet out
side touch to pui the game awav. Si.
(llair, Powell, Moos, juniors knjoli
fzidor .ind Lindsey Yamasaki and
even freshman Beck\ Bonnet not

in the act from behind the arc , as
I he (lardinal shot I I -of-23 from the
three-point line 1 .
While Stanford's offensive el
loi is stole the show, iis defense was
belter Ili.in ever. The (lardinal
posted 12 blocks, lb steals and 25
forced turnovers against the strug
gling Minutewomen.
Still, VanDerveer knows that
when her team leaves the comfort

of Maples Pavilion — where the
squad went on a six-win tear alter
.in opening nielli upset .it St. Mary 's
— the wins won't come so easily.
"I thought [Sunday's win] was a

Iluee-point bomb squad.
According to VanDerveer, king
and Powell have adjusted well to
their roles in the starting lineup
after sophomore Jamie (larey's re
tirement.
"[Losing darey] has been a big
adjustment," VanDerveer said.
| Bui | our guard play is good, and
the team is getting used to Susan
and Nicole. Also, I like plaving a big
"2" guard, which Nicole gives us."

In I Mass's press, Stanford look a
31-21 lead into the locker room at
halltime. 112 ilings didn't get am bet

(loyner tried to pull her team up
liom iis stagnant start, Stanlord
built and maintained a 20-point
lead throughout the last 12 minutes
ol the second hall.

While Stanford's offensive el

belter Ili.in ever. The (lardinal
posted 12 blocks, lb steals and 25

Still, VanDerveer knows that
when her team leaves the comfort

of Maples Pavilion — where the
squad went on a six-win tear alter
.in opening nielli upset .it St. Mary 's
— the wins won't come so easily.
"I thought [Sunday's win] was a

said.
" I his has been ;i real good
stretch. Now, we'll work hard for
two weeks in preparation for 1 cn

Senior Carolyn Moos is not only a threat from the paint (as shown here) but
the center can also score from behind the arc, as shown against UMass.
Moos is shooting .714 from three-point range so far this season.
