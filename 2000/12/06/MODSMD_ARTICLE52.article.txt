will get a two-week break to
spend endless hours in the library
with the rest of the students at the

age student who gets to go home
for some rest and relaxation,
hard work is just beginning for
ifie Cardinal .is it battles three
ranked teams on the road in a 10-
day stretch.
Stanford is riding a streak of
five home victories, and in the
past two weeks has gained more
poise and confidence each time it
takes the floor. After )>laying sev
eral unranked area rivals, it is
time lor the team to test its game
against renowned opponents.
Stanford isn't starting small on
its toad show, beginning the tour

are one of the premiere teams in
women's college basketball, win
ning six national championships
and narrowly missing their sev
enth last year as the runner-up.
In last year's Thanksgiving
weekend matchup at Maples
Pavilion, the Cardinal played the
Lady Vols even throughout most
of the game before a three-point
er by Tennessee's fatnika Catch
ings ignited a late game scoring
run ending in an eventual 79-73
win for Tennessee.
The Lady Vols return all five
starters and all key reserves from
last year's squad. With an early 5-0
record, Tennessee is looking near
ly unstoppable. Leading the way
are senior All-Americans CPatch
ings and Senieka Randall.
Stanford head coach l ata
Van Dei veer has fat ed Tennessee
on several occasions and knows

her team must execute with near
perfection.
"One, we have to handle [the
Lady Vols's] defensive pressure,"
said VanDerveer. " They want to
take you out of your offensive
flow; in football terms, they realh
have a "blitzing" defense. They
are aggressive and like to take
away the passing lanes. Also, we
have to limit their transition bas
kets and keep them oil the offen
sive boards."
After leaving knoxville, the
Cardinal doesn't get much of a
break, travelling up to No. f> Pur
due to face the Boilermakers on
Dec. 19. Purdue has bolted toa 7-
