()ik' of ilic challenges of pro
din a renowned play siu h as
Oscar Wilde's " The Importance
of Being Karnest" is to craft a
fresh adaptation of the work, yet
to remain true to the original vi
sion of the playwright. With its
fusion of well-timed comedic
overtures and delicately exhibit
ed satire, director Steven Gos
san's production of "Karnest"
rises to t he < hallenge.
1 "he final work of the Irish
horn Wilde, "Karnest" chronic les
the sometimes (harming, some
times wicked and always droll
theatrics of two London men as
they attempt to gain the affec
tions of a pair of laches who are
diametrically committed to mar

"Krnest." More importantly, the

to unashamcdh expose the pre

eclipsed by Ins inconsistent

morplis into an American drawl.
"Earnest" epitomizes Wilde's
marvelous wit and sense of tim
ing by launching a good-hu
mored attack 011 the blatant su
perficiality and flagrant extrava
gance' of upper-class, turn-of-the
century Victorian society. The

essence of the play is straightfor
ward, with tight dialogue, and
the production espouses these
characteristics remarkably well.
Minimalist sets and sound ef
fects, coupled with elaborate cos
tumes and highly animated the
atrics (including some cleverly
timed physic al comedy) allow the
loc us of the play to be the < harac
ters and the exceedingly clever
dialogue they deliver.
In describing Algernon .is a
prospective suitor for young Ce

liciously and trans genderly por
trayed by (lhan (lasey, states that,
"lie has nothing, but lie looks
everything," much to Algernon's
delight. And, in the same vein,
she brazenly explains that when
it comes to matters of great con
sequence, "style, not sincerity, is
of the utmost importance."
