the music scene in the earl) ''.Mis, he has
been a major plau r behind the scenes,
both nationally and internationally. Mis
albums with Kool Keith, "l>r. Octagone

classically trained violinist and spent 13
years in Oakland practicing daily before
he put down the stringed instrument in
favor of the decks. "I wasn't a virtuoso or
anything," he laughs.
But he admits that his classical training
helped. Learning the Su/uki method, in

his own version. I lie result is ;i height

make musi< all along, but I jusi didn't
know it vet." he said, lie used all of his
cashtohm pop musii beldre he made the

jump to DJing. Being a disc jockey was still
appreciative with respect to the music.

he felt that he wanted to make his own
beats.
