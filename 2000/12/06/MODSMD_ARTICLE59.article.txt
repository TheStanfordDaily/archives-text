We're fucked.
II the future is anything like I lie
dark, soldier-infested wasteland Del
the Funkee I lomosapien, Kid
Koala and 1 )an the Automator have
in mind, the year 3030 will he .1 had
one. But, in the parlance of slackers
everywhere, screw it. At least we'll
he partying to some phat heats and
intelligent lyrics.
Hie trio of established local hip
hop artists provide a view into the
next inillenium in "Deltron 3030."
Kach artist brings his own touch to
the alhum, and, together, the three
have brought us a complete album
the likes of Dan the Automatons
breakout album, "Dr. ()ctagonecol
ogist" with Kool Keith. In lact, be
cause of the social satire provided
by Del's lyrics, this new release is an
even loftier piece of pop art.
Dan the Automator, a classically
trained violinist, is by anv measure

one of the premier music producers
in hip-hop today and, some might
say, the leader of the pack, lie's
used Middle Eastern .instruments
.liul symphonic samples for years,
and his influence can he readily
heard on radio stations the likes of
KMFI, and |AMN, though his own

music has been confined mostly to
college stations.
His use of strings on "Deltron
3030" is what gives the album its
musical legitimacy. These aren't the
hare-bones, drum-kit beats that
Master I' peddles — these are com
plicated songs that intertwine ele
ments of the past, like the strings,
.ind elements of the luture, like the
self-created beeps and whistles that

]xiiiciualt' the beat. The result is
true hip-hop at its greatest — .1

and jaz./ to jungle and dul).
"Deltron" < outaitis a broad list ol
instruments: harps, sitars, flutes, vi
olins, stand-up basses, cellos, saxes
and ti limpets are all present behind

and you've got <1 musical cornu

The 20th and final (rack, "Mem
ory Loss," is a good example of a
combination ol the skills ol all three
artists. Kid Koala creates the chorus
by scratching an old Del tune,
"(latch a Bad ()ne," in which Del af
firms, "People bavin' memory loss,
they don't remember I'm the boss."
Dan starts the song oil'on a grand
scale, using trumpets to proclaim
Del's reign as the boss.
And Del is the boss. As one of the
lyricist's stan/as starts: "My nigger's

cooking some crack/And moms gets
the first hit / That's OK with you,
that's ()K with me/ I'm not here to
judge how the way you he /1 got my
own complications/The govern
ment shooter's rations / Plantations
is 111.ul labor / Five Bucks for hourly
intervals — I get a g lor that / So be
lieve when I spit to you, it's giving
back/Don't think I'm living that
dream /When the IRS reposseses
most of your cream."
You'd be hard-pressed to find
another rapper out there that com
bines a fantastical vision ol the In
line with trash talkingand boasting,
as well as cutting s<xial criticism.
Kool Keith tomes to mind, hut Del
just makes sense more often.
For instance, take this, 111 the title
track, and imagine at warp-speed:
"Automator / Auto-slayer / Fasci
natin' / domhinatin' / Cyber-war
lords/()f aggravating abominations.
/Armored nation with hatred,/ We
ain't with that / We high-tech arche
ologists searching for knick-knacks .
.. I used to he a mech soldier / But I

didn't respect orders /1 had to step
forward/ 'I ell them this ain't lor us,/
Living in a post-apocalv■pt.it world,/
Morbid and horrid, / The secrets ol
the past, the\ hoarded. / Now we just
hoarded/( )u a futuristic spacecraft!
No mistakes, Black/ It's our music
we must take back!" lint don't lorget
the apocalyptic orchestra rising iu
the background and culminating
with emphatic trumpets in the final
statement.
On some tracks, Del slows his
llow a hit to match the music. Kit her
that, or lie's lost a hit of a step, lint
lie's still aina/.ing, and so is "Deltron
3030." The background story is just
the icing on the take, as it makes the
album leel like a complete piece.
Damon Albarn ol Blur narrates as a
spokesperson ior the corporation
that runs the world, and the trio ol
the Autoniator, Koala and Del are
rebel mech-soldiers resisting the
system and the rhyme federation.
But, for the whole story, consult
tracks one through !21 on "Deltron
3030." Del does a better job.
