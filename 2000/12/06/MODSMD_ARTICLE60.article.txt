# Christmas Christina reveals her skinny navel, lame Xmas songs

Christmas albums .lie .in interesting phenome
non in t lit* music industry. II if vast majority of
singers recording them put musical accountability
and integrit\ 011 the shell to put out seasonal music
that is sure to sell. Although these albums are capi
talistic extensions of an artist's body of work, some
<>l tliein hit dead-011 and become classics people will
continue to enjoy. But some of them will have dilli
citly outlasting \our two-year-old cousin's slobberv

candv-cane. "M\ Kind ol Christ
inas," sadly, will have .1 similarly
undignified end.
()f < nurse, (.hi istina Aguilera's
intentions were good. "I wanted
to bring .1 real R&B edge to some
ol these songs. Makiug.the .ilbitin
really unleashed the soul in me,"
she said. (Composed ol both tradi-

tional .md new, pop-inspired ma
terial, ii is (lear Ironi the outset that the alhuni will
not he the Mormon I abernacle dhoir's kind ol
('.hi ist mas.
Ilie liisi tra< kon the album is a rather cat< hy,
beat-driven tune titled "dbristmas lime." It was
produced In C.elehritv Status and Ron l air, who
were responsible lor the hit single, "dome On
Over," and it moves along to .1 pulsing dark base
and twinkling, synthesized harpsichord in minor
keys. "Open your heart now/ I his is the time for us
to give / I lie world needs love now / So live and let
live," raps Aguilera towards the end ol the tra< k.
I lie li Ist < lassie song on the album is "Have
Yourself a Merrv Little dli list mas," and Miss Aguil
era docs a lovely job. She imparts her own st\ lc well
here. Moreover, it is one ol the lew songs 011 the
album that won't make your grandma's toes curl.

In "Angels We Have Heard On High" Christina is
joined by Billy IMeston and a 70-voice Cospel
(Ihoir. It is a strange juxtaposition, but the strength
of the < lioii balances out Aguilera's powerful vocals
well and the song's vitality has you tapping your
feet against your better judgment.
"Merry (Ihristmas, Baby' could be slipped into a
play list line-up lor a strip-joint and no one would
know the difference. It has .ill the auditory conno
tations ol pasties and pole-dam ing, plus some sug
gestive lui<s. "Merry Christmas Bab) / You suit
did treat me nice," moans Christina as horns are
played In Sammy Nestico of I he Count BasieOr-

chestra.
1 "lie* additional solo by Dr. John
is excellent and complements
Aguilera nicely. But its inclusion
m a yuletide collection is terribly
disturbing. Tlie last time I
( bet ked, s( ;mtil\ -t lad women and
(ihristmastime are as incompati
ble in prim iple as you can get, but

this gil l pist isn't going to stop until the holidavs are
sexy.
I he remix of" I lie Christmas Song" has .1 driving
techno pulse, replete with lots of spat ey sounds.
I'oi what n is trying 10 accomplish, it is successful
and vcr\ Inn. It could be a good seasonal club tunc.
Now Aguilera is .1 diva, and divas are prone to an
intensity of'self-scrutini/ation remarkably close to
what us mortals would call "vanity." Hut this ego
ceiiti isin helps them to understand their voices so
well that they know exactly how to sing to play
down their weaknesses and play up their strengths.
Mariah relies on her resonance; Whitney, her
power; deline banks on her refinement; and Mary
lets her soul c arry her singing. But Christina de
pends on vocal embellishment.

What a navel. I mean really. Have you ever seen a navel like that
This embellishment is the main
downfall of the album, outside ol'
the awful writing. This way of
singing does an excellent job of
showcasing Aguilera s beautiful
voice but quickly becomes ex
hausting for the listener. All die
traditional songs would have been
immeasurably better without so
many sugary nourishes. "Oh NII
liiil 11 liiighhht Deevilllcelllne /
Ooaaahhooh Nlll liiil 11ght /
When Christ was bOoohhoo
-11111 Itn," she wails on her rendi
tion of"C)h I loly Night."
Aguilera's woo/.y delivery c*
somewhat resembles that of her
self-proclaimed idol, Mariah
Carey. In some places, it is so
dense with techniques Carey de
vised that one might mistake the
two women's singing. Aguilera,
however, has a certain diva purity
that Carey lost long ago; it takes
me back to the days when (iarey's
clothes were bigger, her ego was
smaller and her seven-octave
range was still unsullied by ciga
rettes.
But, clone or not, Aguilera is *
talented. And she would do more
for her career and her critical au
dience if she didn't sing this tripe.

two women's singing. Aguilera,
however, has a certain diva purity
that Carey lost long ago; it takes
me back to the days when (iarey's
clothes were bigger, her ego was
smaller and her seven-octave
range was still unsullied by ciga
rettes.
But, clone or not, Aguilera is *
talented. And she would do more
for her career and her critical au
dience if she didn't sing this tripe.
