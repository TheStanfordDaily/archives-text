# Vertical Horizon, Nine Days play Big Game concert
## Sold-out crowd enjoys three hours of soft pop-rock and 'real emotions' 
### STEPHANIE CHIANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sincerity. Simplicity. Success.
No, this is not ;i plug fora new dot-corn
company. I his is Vertical Horizon's path
to stardom — and it's working.
This success was obvious at their Nov.
18 performance with Nine Days in Memo
rial Auditorium. 1 'he ti< keis to the concert
sold out, and many fans arrived well before
the 8 p.m. start. I lie entire auditorium was
filled to capacity with fans from pre-teens
to lbrty-somethings. just past 8 p.m., the
crowd stood up and gave a deafening
( lieer of antic ipation as the auditorium's
lights dimmed.
lame, however, wasn't what Matt Scan
nell and Keith Kane originall) had iu mind
when they began Vertical Horizon in 1991
.it Georgetown Univeristy. Scannell met
Kane when he became a regular attendee
at Kane's Tuesday evening gigs, and they
quickly formed a dose friendship.
Unlike pre-packaged boy bands (which
shall remain unnamed), Scannell and
Kane based their band on "simple songs
played with sincerity." Kane adds, "VVe try
to put the focus on lyrics, melodies and
chord progressions. We're not into huge
productions, just real emotions, real situa
tions." Almost nine years later and alter the
addition of Sean Hurley (bass) and Kd
loth (drums), Vertical Horizon's success
continues to spring from this grassroots
appeal.

Strikingly enough. Nine Days's style
and mantra c losely resemble that of Verti
cal I lorizon's. Indeed, they also dismiss the
impersonality of currently popular "manu
factured" artists, emphasizing their own
originality. "We're not trying to make
grand statements, the band said in a press
release. "We just write music that's true to
us, that has a sincerity and integrity. We
hope that years later — for the rest of our
lives — ii will have resonance."

It is this freshness of sound thai song
writers |«>lin Hampson and Brian
Desveaux strive to achieve, as the\ blend
\S()s rock with the intensity of Dylan,
Springsteen and Neil Young. Mampson
explains, "We want the songs to hi- the
focal point, as opposed lo a loud guitar or
a screaming vocal. I he whole point was il
it's not a great song with just von and a gui

tar, then it's not a great song." As their bur
geoning popularity proves, this sincerit\
struck the right chord.
As Nine Days began the concert with
dramatic red lighting and a darkened
background, the crowd briefly <|uieted
down .nul then roared as the band assem
bled on stage. Nine Days opened with
"You Are the ()111y ()ne," and their hit sin
gle, "111 Am," quickly followed.
Alter these rather soil pop / rock piec es,
however, Nine Days crashed into a much
edgier "bob Dylan' and "257 Weeks.
Their <mstage charisma was unmistakable:
Noi only did they interact with the audi
ence by asking everyone to clap and sing
along, iliev also radiated absolute comlort
on stage. Best of all, their sound equaled, il
not exceeded, the quality of their record
ings.
A touching element «>1 their perfor
mance was llainpson s repeated refer
ences to Vertical I lori/on's generosity and
talent —especially because Saturday
night was their lasi stop on tour together.
Their camaraderie was evident when Ver
tical Horizon members pulled out a table
and pi/.zas as Nine Days launched into
their hit song, "Absolutely (Story of a
(lirl)."
"We've wanted to buy them clinnerbe
canse they've been so great," Scanned said,
as I lampson stopped mid-line in laughtei
After taking a few biles and passing some


slices to some eager fans, 1 lamp
son resinned "Absolutely," and
Nine Days ended their perfor
mance with "So Far Away."
After a 15-minute intermis
sion, Vertical Horizon emerged
on stage with a green spotlight
that morphed to an equally the
atrical red light.
Their clothing mirrored their
musical style: Scanned wore a
metallic, snake-print shirt, while
Kane sported a black shirt with
the Chinese characters "dragon
dance" emblazoned on the
front. They played a refur
bished "Catidyman," and sever
al complex acoustical modula
tions.
Performing on big Came,
Scannell paused several songs
into the set and said, "I heard
that there was a football game
today." As the crowd cheered,
he and his band began playing a
section of "All Right Now." In
deed, such conscious catering to
the crowd is indubitably the ex
planation for Vertical Horizon's
success.
After playing "The Best I
Ever Had," "Send It Up" and
"Heart In Hand," they finished

with their highly popular "We
Are." As soon as Vertical Hori
zon exited the st.ige, however,
the crowd chanted the "Ole"
cheer in increasing tempo until
both Vertical Horizon and Nine
Days re-entered the stage with a
table, paper cups and bottles of
champagne.
Scannell took the micro
phone and declared that he
"wish[ed] there was enough
champagne for everyone . . . but
[he had] love —and that's
enough." As members from both
bands lif ted their cups of cham
pagne, Scannell toasted "to a
kick-ass tour, thanking Nine
Days."
To many fans' delight, Nine
Days and Vertical Horizon
played several songs together,
including "Teenage Wasteland"
and a slower, sexier version of
"Absolutely."
As an encore, however, they
pulled out .ill the stops: Deveaux
of Nine Days began and Scan
nell finished Vertical Horizon's
smash single, "You're a Cod."
After this final song of the
night — three hours after start
ing time — the crowd gave the
bands its final cheer. As visitor
and die-hard fan Terry Long of
Pennsylvania summarizes, "It
was the best I ever had."

shall remain unnamed), Scannell and
Kane based their band on "simple songs
played with sincerity." Kane adds, "VVe try
to put the focus on lyrics, melodies and
chord progressions. We're not into huge
productions, just real emotions, real situa
tions." Almost nine years later and alter the
addition of Sean Hurley (bass) and Kd
loth (drums), Vertical Horizon's success
continues to spring from this grassroots
appeal.

Strikingly enough. Nine Days's style
and mantra c losely resemble that of Verti
cal I lorizon's. Indeed, they also dismiss the
impersonality of currently popular "manu
factured" artists, emphasizing their own
originality. "We're not trying to make
grand statements, the band said in a press
release. "We just write music that's true to
us, that has a sincerity and integrity. We
hope that years later — for the rest of our
lives — ii will have resonance."

It is this freshness of sound thai song
writers |«>lin Hampson and Brian
Desveaux strive to achieve, as the\ blend
\S()s rock with the intensity of Dylan,
Springsteen and Neil Young. Mampson
explains, "We want the songs to hi- the
focal point, as opposed lo a loud guitar or
a screaming vocal. I he whole point was il
it's not a great song with just von and a gui

tar, then it's not a great song." As their bur
geoning popularity proves, this sincerit\
struck the right chord.
As Nine Days began the concert with
dramatic red lighting and a darkened
background, the crowd briefly <|uieted
down .nul then roared as the band assem
bled on stage. Nine Days opened with
"You Are the ()111y ()ne," and their hit sin
gle, "111 Am," quickly followed.
Alter these rather soil pop / rock piec es,
however, Nine Days crashed into a much
edgier "bob Dylan' and "257 Weeks.
Their <mstage charisma was unmistakable:
Noi only did they interact with the audi
ence by asking everyone to clap and sing
along, iliev also radiated absolute comlort
on stage. Best of all, their sound equaled, il
not exceeded, the quality of their record
ings.
A touching element «>1 their perfor
mance was llainpson s repeated refer
ences to Vertical I lori/on's generosity and
talent —especially because Saturday
night was their lasi stop on tour together.
Their camaraderie was evident when Ver
tical Horizon members pulled out a table
and pi/.zas as Nine Days launched into
their hit song, "Absolutely (Story of a
(lirl)."
"We've wanted to buy them clinnerbe
canse they've been so great," Scanned said,
as I lampson stopped mid-line in laughtei
After taking a few biles and passing some


slices to some eager fans, 1 lamp
son resinned "Absolutely," and
Nine Days ended their perfor
mance with "So Far Away."
After a 15-minute intermis
sion, Vertical Horizon emerged
on stage with a green spotlight
that morphed to an equally the
atrical red light.
Their clothing mirrored their
musical style: Scanned wore a
metallic, snake-print shirt, while
Kane sported a black shirt with
the Chinese characters "dragon
dance" emblazoned on the
front. They played a refur
bished "Catidyman," and sever
al complex acoustical modula
tions.
Performing on big Came,
Scannell paused several songs
into the set and said, "I heard
that there was a football game
today." As the crowd cheered,
he and his band began playing a
section of "All Right Now." In
deed, such conscious catering to
the crowd is indubitably the ex
planation for Vertical Horizon's
success.
After playing "The Best I
Ever Had," "Send It Up" and
"Heart In Hand," they finished

with their highly popular "We
Are." As soon as Vertical Hori
zon exited the st.ige, however,
the crowd chanted the "Ole"
cheer in increasing tempo until
both Vertical Horizon and Nine
Days re-entered the stage with a
table, paper cups and bottles of
champagne.
Scannell took the micro
phone and declared that he
"wish[ed] there was enough
champagne for everyone . . . but
[he had] love —and that's
enough." As members from both
bands lif ted their cups of cham
pagne, Scannell toasted "to a
kick-ass tour, thanking Nine
Days."
To many fans' delight, Nine
Days and Vertical Horizon
played several songs together,
including "Teenage Wasteland"
and a slower, sexier version of
"Absolutely."
As an encore, however, they
pulled out .ill the stops: Deveaux
of Nine Days began and Scan
nell finished Vertical Horizon's
smash single, "You're a Cod."
After this final song of the
night — three hours after start
ing time — the crowd gave the
bands its final cheer. As visitor
and die-hard fan Terry Long of
Pennsylvania summarizes, "It
was the best I ever had."
