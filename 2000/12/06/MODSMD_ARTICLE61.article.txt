Sincerity. Simplicity. Success.
No, this is not ;i plug fora new dot-corn
company. I his is Vertical Horizon's path
to stardom — and it's working.
This success was obvious at their Nov.
18 performance with Nine Days in Memo
rial Auditorium. 1 'he ti< keis to the concert
sold out, and many fans arrived well before
the 8 p.m. start. I lie entire auditorium was
filled to capacity with fans from pre-teens
to lbrty-somethings. just past 8 p.m., the
crowd stood up and gave a deafening

lights dimmed.
lame, however, wasn't what Matt Scan
nell and Keith Kane originall) had iu mind
when they began Vertical Horizon in 1991
.it Georgetown Univeristy. Scannell met
Kane when he became a regular attendee
at Kane's Tuesday evening gigs, and they
quickly formed a dose friendship.
Unlike pre-packaged boy bands (which
shall remain unnamed), Scannell and
Kane based their band on "simple songs
played with sincerity." Kane adds, "VVe try
to put the focus on lyrics, melodies and
chord progressions. We're not into huge
productions, just real emotions, real situa
tions." Almost nine years later and alter the
addition of Sean Hurley (bass) and Kd
loth (drums), Vertical Horizon's success
continues to spring from this grassroots
appeal.

Strikingly enough. Nine Days's style
and mantra c losely resemble that of Verti
cal I lorizon's. Indeed, they also dismiss the
impersonality of currently popular "manu
factured" artists, emphasizing their own
originality. "We're not trying to make
grand statements, the band said in a press
release. "We just write music that's true to
us, that has a sincerity and integrity. We
hope that years later — for the rest of our
lives — ii will have resonance."

It is this freshness of sound thai song

Desveaux strive to achieve, as the\ blend
\S()s rock with the intensity of Dylan,
Springsteen and Neil Young. Mampson
explains, "We want the songs to hi- the
focal point, as opposed lo a loud guitar or
a screaming vocal. I he whole point was il
it's not a great song with just von and a gui

tar, then it's not a great song." As their bur
geoning popularity proves, this sincerit\
struck the right chord.
As Nine Days began the concert with
dramatic red lighting and a darkened
background, the crowd briefly <|uieted

bled on stage. Nine Days opened with
"You Are the ()111y ()ne," and their hit sin
gle, "111 Am," quickly followed.
Alter these rather soil pop / rock piec es,
however, Nine Days crashed into a much
edgier "bob Dylan' and "257 Weeks.
Their <mstage charisma was unmistakable:
Noi only did they interact with the audi
ence by asking everyone to clap and sing
along, iliev also radiated absolute comlort
on stage. Best of all, their sound equaled, il
not exceeded, the quality of their record
ings.

talent —especially because Saturday
night was their lasi stop on tour together.
Their camaraderie was evident when Ver

their hit song, "Absolutely (Story of a
