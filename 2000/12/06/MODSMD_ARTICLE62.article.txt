There's a lesser-known song of
Elliott Smith's called "pretty (ugly
before)." These days, he bears a
kind of resemblance. The one-time
stalwart of the Northwest indie
scene, whose music found broad
exposure in "(»ood Will I hinting."
now makes guest appearances on
NPR's Morning Edition and David
Eetterman.
Eiv Tyler, David Bowie and
other luminaries have been spot
ted at Smith's recent concerts. I lis
appearance at the 1998 Ac ademy
Awards — apart from a surreal
moment in which our unassuming,
somewhat frumpy hero found
himself sandwiched between Ce
line Dion and Trisha Yearwood —
seems less ironic now than it did at
the time.

For 11 lost* ol us who have seen
liini t-iil In all .111 audio ire auompa
tiied only by his acoustic guitar. his
limit Rolling Stone-sponsored
show in San Francisco took some
getting used to, as much Ibr his
pla\ ing with .1 lull backing band .is
lot the atmosphere in the W'ai licld.
I he venue's stiiid patrons en joying
table service in the rear, $25 I
shirts and a giant video screen .11
the back ol the stage, llanked In
Philips and Motorola Stai 1 at logos
were a bit oil-putting.
Somewhat surprisingly — and,
thankfully, given the milieu — he
opened the night with the harrow
ing "Needle in the Hay," an earK
song off his first, self-titled album
lor Kill Rock Stars. The rock ver
sion's anthemic strife was a striking
transformation of the confused
desperation that seethed below the
surface of the original, when the
rhythm section consisted entireh

ol Elliott's compulsive, relentless
picking.
He followed with this year's
odd, whimsical "Son ol Sam," with
the band Hexing its muscle in the
bridge's crescendo as Elliott sang,
king fora day! I hen c ame an en
gaging, electric version ol another
earlv song, "Clementine," with its
wr\ opening tritones. Some of the
< harm and poignancy of the origi
nal was lost in the translation,
though. There was something
about Elliott's unhurried, rhyth
mic strumming between the vocal
lines that made the imagery so
inviting: " They're waking yon up
to close the bar . . . / The street's
wet, you can tell by the sound of the
c ars . . . / The bartender's singing
(llementine.. ./While he's turning
around the open sign ..
The rest of the set drew mostly
from the band-oriented songs on
his two recent Dream Works releas

es, "ligure 8" and"X()." A couple
ol the high points writ- a weird
pro< cssion ol ( .tiling dyads dm in
"I lappint'ss," with its purposeliilh
sauntering backbeat, and the etlu
teal "Kverything Means Notliin
to Me."
But tin' highlight ol the eveniii
tame in the acoustic encore, win
(.limit, with friend Shon Sulliv.n
on cello, performed "The While
Lad\ Loves You More," a tendci
wrenching song about losing
loved one toaddiction: "Keep yon
things in a place meant to hidi
but I know they're there, souk
where / And I know that's where
you'll go tonight."
It was .1 reminder ol how alle< I
ing and personal some <>1 his songs
are. And though this tour wasn't
meant to show this side of him, let's
hope he never loses touch with n
no matter where his musical join
neys lead him.
