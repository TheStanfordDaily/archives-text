Shyamalan's distim live
camera movement selec
tivel\ leads us through the
story again, while James

Newton Howard provides another atmos
pheric soundtrack to att ompanv the unfold
ing events. The movie even ends in much the
same way, aiming lor that unexpected revela
tion tli.it leaves us breathless.
Willis's 1 liarat ter, I )avid Dunn, is a securi
ty guard at a local sports stadium who hap
pens to be the only survivor of a fatal train
wreck near Shyanialan's favorite city,
Philadelphia. Dimu is approached by the
frail Klijah Price (the always absorbing
Samuel L. |ackson), an art dealer who at
tempts to convince Dunn that he is, iu fact,
"unbreakable" and destined for higher
things.

The story is set against the idea ol comic
hooks and the creation ol comic book heroes
something that I II admit sounded iuiii.tlK
quite preposterous.
( hidly enough, the story still remains pret
t\ credible even as it attempts to establish
Dunn's "unbreakable" qualities, because it
keeps that aspect ol the story rather under
stated, something most Hollywood movies
could learn to do.
As you might surmise, though, maintain
ing the film's ( rcdihility isn't as bard as bring
ing a ston like- this to an ellective conclusion.
So Dunn's unbreakable. What now? Does be
don the tights and become a real superhero?
Hie film's com lusion seems .1 bit slapdash, al
beit understandabl) so.
Still, my initial response to "Unbreakable"
was rather tepid, jusi like my reaction to its
predecessor. Along with the familiar atmos
phere of a Shvanialan movie come the famil
iar aspects that kept "Sense" from being com
pletely endearing: the torpid pacing, the
characters that often lack any depth or real
development and several blocks of excruciat
ingly meaningless dialogue.
Robin Wright I'enn seems particularly
wasted 111 the trivial role of Dunn's distant
wife. In some aspects, Shyamalan's movies
probably take themselves .1 bit too seriously;
every line and every action is played out
with agonizing gravity, even while other
points of the plot seem disturbingly simplis

lie. (Dunn can't remember that he's never
had a sit k clay? (Lome on.)
1 lit' patient e of the audience is constant
l\ tested as we try to slay interested and pa\
attention in order to reach the meaningful
conclusion.
Yet lor some reason, the movie stays with
me. My opinion grows more favorable the
more I think about it, and I think this growing
ailed ion comes from the very same thing I
might have maligned a bit in the beginning of
this review: naiueh .the fiict that Shyamalan is
making himself a niche artist, coming to spe
cialize in the one type of movie his newlbund
success is based upon.
As an avid moviegoer, I like that kind ol
dependability, to be able to go to a movie
every once in a while th.it truly does take it
sell seriously and wants the audience to
think. Hven il all of Night's movies from
now on are of this genre (marketed as a hy
brid ol suspense and drama), it's a unique
genre that's definitely welcome in today's
market.
Shvamalan's uncanny ability to craft sto
ries and clelth misdirect the audience can't
be denied either. Shyamalan has already
been relet red to as the modern I litchcix k b\
some over/.ealous members of the media,
and I can see how this presumptuous title
might eventually be justified. "I nbrcakahle"
isn't as invincible as it would have you be
lieve. but it's definitely worth a look.

When I spotted the trailer lor "I nbreak
ahle," though, I got .1 hit worried. "I Imnun,"
I thought to myself, liruce Willis wandering
around in another moody, mysterious envi
ronment. Very sketehy. This was the most
blatant imitation of another movie I'd ever

" I n'jreakahle" does hear a reinarkahle re
semblance to "Sense, something I find rather
disappointing. Not <>ul\ does Bruce Willis

Shyamalan's distim live
camera movement selec
tivel\ leads us through the
story again, while James

Newton Howard provides another atmos
pheric soundtrack to att ompanv the unfold
ing events. The movie even ends in much the
same way, aiming lor that unexpected revela
tion tli.it leaves us breathless.
Willis's 1 liarat ter, I )avid Dunn, is a securi
ty guard at a local sports stadium who hap
pens to be the only survivor of a fatal train
wreck near Shyanialan's favorite city,
Philadelphia. Dimu is approached by the
frail Klijah Price (the always absorbing
Samuel L. |ackson), an art dealer who at
tempts to convince Dunn that he is, iu fact,
"unbreakable" and destined for higher
things.

The story is set against the idea ol comic
hooks and the creation ol comic book heroes
something that I II admit sounded iuiii.tlK
quite preposterous.
( hidly enough, the story still remains pret
t\ credible even as it attempts to establish
Dunn's "unbreakable" qualities, because it
keeps that aspect ol the story rather under
stated, something most Hollywood movies
could learn to do.
As you might surmise, though, maintain
ing the film's ( rcdihility isn't as bard as bring
ing a ston like- this to an ellective conclusion.
So Dunn's unbreakable. What now? Does be
don the tights and become a real superhero?
Hie film's com lusion seems .1 bit slapdash, al
beit understandabl) so.
Still, my initial response to "Unbreakable"
was rather tepid, jusi like my reaction to its
predecessor. Along with the familiar atmos
phere of a Shvanialan movie come the famil
iar aspects that kept "Sense" from being com
pletely endearing: the torpid pacing, the
characters that often lack any depth or real
development and several blocks of excruciat
ingly meaningless dialogue.
Robin Wright I'enn seems particularly
wasted 111 the trivial role of Dunn's distant
wife. In some aspects, Shyamalan's movies
probably take themselves .1 bit too seriously;
every line and every action is played out
with agonizing gravity, even while other
points of the plot seem disturbingly simplis

lie. (Dunn can't remember that he's never
had a sit k clay? (Lome on.)
1 lit' patient e of the audience is constant
l\ tested as we try to slay interested and pa\
attention in order to reach the meaningful
conclusion.
Yet lor some reason, the movie stays with
me. My opinion grows more favorable the
more I think about it, and I think this growing
ailed ion comes from the very same thing I
might have maligned a bit in the beginning of
this review: naiueh .the fiict that Shyamalan is
making himself a niche artist, coming to spe
cialize in the one type of movie his newlbund
success is based upon.
As an avid moviegoer, I like that kind ol
dependability, to be able to go to a movie
every once in a while th.it truly does take it
sell seriously and wants the audience to
think. Hven il all of Night's movies from
now on are of this genre (marketed as a hy
brid ol suspense and drama), it's a unique
genre that's definitely welcome in today's
market.
Shvamalan's uncanny ability to craft sto
ries and clelth misdirect the audience can't
be denied either. Shyamalan has already
been relet red to as the modern I litchcix k b\
some over/.ealous members of the media,
and I can see how this presumptuous title
might eventually be justified. "I nbrcakahle"
isn't as invincible as it would have you be
lieve. but it's definitely worth a look.
