# Interview with the sadist
## Peter Kaufman talks to Intermission about sex, violence and Bill Clinton 
### JOHANNA WINANT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Marquis de S;ide would like
to tell you a story. I Ie will whisper it
to you with theseratchingol his quill
pen Ironi behind the walls of a men
tal institute in 19th-century France.
It will he sexually perverse, it will he
violent, it will he disturbing, and you
will want to hear more.
Your curiosity, your desire and
your revulsion are fulfilled while
you sit in a dark room tilled with
strangers. The movie "Quills" tells
the story of the Marquis de Sade's
lile as if it were one of his own dark
and fascinating literary creations.
I he Marquis was a historical fig
ure. A nobleman who barely es
caped the guillotine during the
French Revolution, he would regu
larly whip prostitutes and repeated
1\ raped and brutalized children.
()ur word "sadism" is derived from
his name.
The Marquis de Sade wrote
books — still iu print today, though
banned for obscenity in his century
that, drawing on his sexual expe
riences, explored the underbelly of
the human psyche, lie was also a
man who hated hypocrisy, believed
in abolishing the death penalty and
treasured freedom of expression.
Simone de lieauvoir called him an
important forerunner to Freud.
The Marquis was also a mad
man. lie was imprisoned in the
bastille, witnessed the rivers ol
blood of the French Reign of" Ferror
and spent the remainder of his life
at the Charenton mental institute.
"Quills" is the story of the Mar
tinis' time at Charenton. Sade ((ie
offrey Rush) is a creative spirit who
must write as an outlet for his imag
ination. I le is permitted to have ink,
paper and quills by the modern and
humane director of the institute,
Abbe de Coulmier (Joaquin
Phoenix). Madeleine (Kate Winslct)
is the laundry maid who smuggles
out the Marquis' writing lor publi
cation. Dr. Royer-('.ollard (Michael
(-aine) is the cruel physician sent by
Napoleon to oversee the Abbe's new

methods of treating the insane but
also to silence Sade by am means
necessary.
The Abbe and Madeleine are
naively enamored of one another
but irresistibly drawn to the Mar
tinis, who delights in their confu
sion. Dr. Royer-Collard is the ap
parent image ol conventionality,
but Sade pegs him lor an almost
kindred spirit.
When Royer-Collard takes his
c hild-bride to bed and lias frighten
ing enthusiasm lor using torture to
cure the insane, it's clear that Royer
(bollard's crimes are the only delib
erately sadistic actions in the film,
though they run along the same
lines as Sade's words. Simone
(Amelia Warner), Royer-Collard's
convent-reared teenage wile, is .1
wonderful parallel to Madeleine's
character, both innocents are en

is empowered In the Marquis's sto
ries .ind one is destroyed by them.
These characters move toward c olli
sion from the start oftlie movie and,
like a (.reek tragedy, their fates are
inescapable and inseparable.
1 his is a beautiful movie. It is di
rected by Philip Kaufman, himself
110 stranger to controversy over the
graphic content ol his works, in
cluding "Henry and June," "The
Right Stull" and"The Unbearable
Lightness of Being."
Fat li scene in "Quills" is as deli
cately crafted and shot as a vignette,
and each shot is as perfectly cap
tured asa painting. All the actors are
remarkable in their roles. Kate
Winslet is charming as an innocent
maid, but lor all her naivete she is
not <1 simple stereotype. She ex
plains her hunger for the Marquis'
writing by saying that she could not
be "such a good woman in lile if (she
were] not such a bad one on the

page.
Joaquin Phoenix's Abbe is also
.in astonishingly good person dur
ing day-to-day lift-, lie is endlessly
patient and respectful ol his insane
charges and treats Madeleine with
touching gentleness. But he, too.
has a darker side that is brought out
in his contact with Sade.
Michael (laine, fresh oil his
"Cider Mouse Rules Oscar-win
ning role, here plays a chara< lei at
the opposite end ol the spectrum.
Mis Royer-Collard is p.iinlul and
surprising to watch; the malevo
lence is hidden just under his skin
and leaks out of his cool, appraising
eyes.
(leoU'rey Rush's Marquis is a
work of art. A self-indulgent diva
with .111 endless well ol < reativih. his
Sade has a gift lor finding the om
nipresent absurdity iu what every
one else takes for the truth. Rush

deserves an ()scar — his Sack' is hi
larious and sobering, creative and
destructive, a man who is .it once
larger than life and mortal.
"Quills" is a frightening, disturb
ing and ultimately haunting film,
shocking in its graphic portrayal of
the overlap of violence and sex. Is it
not gratuitous lor the sole reason
that the Marquis de Sade needs to
be expressed in the excess ol the
darkness of the id.
"Quills" does not try to defini
tively answer what society can do
with a person like the Marquis. I It
can be a danger when let loose, but
the consequences of silencing him
may be worse. Peter Kaufman, the
producer of "Quills" and the son ol
director Philip Kaufman, spoke to
the Intermission about this film.
Intermission: What originally drew
you to making a movie out ol Doug
Wright's 191)5 ()hie-winning play?

I'eter Kaufman: lo\ Searchlight
sent the script to lMiil and me, we
read it and we were blown awa\. We
were so surprised that a studio
would want to make a movie about
the Marquis deSade. Ii just seemed
like a challenging, interesting and
provocative story. Its based on real
people. There was .1 laundry lass
who actualh did have an allair with
the Marquis; there was a character
who was at tu.illv out to get the Mar
tinis at all costs. Phil and I worked
together — lie read the script, I
read the script, we looked .it each
other and were strangely elated and
terrified.
I: What would vou say are the major
themes of the movie?
I'K: It's about the struggle between
oppression and creation. Ihe op-

pressor usually becomes the muse
of the artist the oppressor is trying
to silence. [The Martinis is an| un
crushahle spirit of creation. ()< tavio
Pa/, said, "I lis voice is no less extra
ordinary than his work. . . The
philosopher of sadism was not a vic
timi/.er but a victim." What we set
out to do was not whitewash him in
any way . . . .It's an entertainment
lirst of all, but within the entertain
ment it deals with serious ideas
about the nature of being a human.
I: What kind of research did you
do?
PK: There have been lour books in
the last year and a half . . . we've
tried to read all of them. There has
been terrific writing by women on
the Marquis tie Satle, like Angela
Carter and Krancine tin Plessix
Cray. There's a very famous essay
by Simone de Beauvoir called

"Must We Hum Sade?" All the
books are sympathetic to the
human side of Sade, trying to un
derstand his humor. And [shooting]
in England, we had this Acadeim
Award set designer. . . . I le had an
amazing collection ol pornography
from that time Another one had
to pro< ure period dildoes.
I: Do you seethe Marquis de Sade as
a tree spirit who exposed the dirty
secrets <>l his hypocritical so( iety or
as a twisted, sic k individual who
needed support and help?
I'K Hut's reall\ lor the viewer to
decide. I personally I eel that it's
some combination, hut I don't want
to come to some conclusion for the
audience. Our hope is that people
will talk about it afterwards. I hope
people (.in think about il before
the\ pass judgment. We live in this

where everyone wants sound
biles, and I hope this will provoke
thought, lie's a real enigma, the
Marquis, and (.colli ev Rush was
the perfect actor to play the role
he understood the madness, the
loneliness of being in prison, be
kept bis lire burning. It's a very
compelling < haracter. Rush, the
greatest living actor in my mind, re
ally became him .... He showed all
sides, the human side ol the Mar
quis de Sade. The Marquis was in
prison lot half his life, but he wrote
every day, he had this incredible
burning desire to write, to create.
I: Is the role of the artist to shake up
society?
I'K: I think that's one of the roles. I
think that artists are very important.
I was living in Taiwan about 20
years ago, and one person said "art
is not useful." We got in this long
debate. I think art is important and
without art you take away beauty.
Art gives us alternatives to our
everyday life. It allows you to escape
the dullness of just investing money
in the stock market. Artists can
every day reinvent themselves. Art
at its best will make better people of
.ill olUs, get us to a higher level.
The tapestry of life is rich. Not
to be kitchy or corny, but people
need to be shaken up; 1 need to be
shaken up. I need to see art that ex
(ites me and stimulates me.
I he Marquis said something
about how "one must acquaint
oneself with vice to know virtue."
We've got to experience things
that we normally wouldn't want to
experience. Some of the Marquis'
works are unreadable, but some
lead the right way are realh inter
esting and vet ) funny. And he did
believe in a woman's light to con
trol her own sexuality and to use
sex as liberation.
1 really hope this film does
reach bright people everywhere
and that there are discussions
about whether people like the
Marquis are important, or
whether we should not allow peo
ple to see him at all.
112: Films such as "One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest," "Girl Inter
rupted," "Silence of the Lambs"
and "Don Juan de Marco" all also
explore the world inside an insane
asylum, and how so-called normal
people view that world. Why do
you think this has emerged as a
theme, and how does "Quills" lit in
with it?
PK: All the films of insanity lead
you to the quest of what is sane and
what is insane. Was Sade reacting
to the insanity he saw - the French
Revolution?
There's a sense of humor in all
of these films too, because the in
sane have freedom to say things
that we can't say. I think it fits into
that tradition of films of the insane,
and why people are interested.
There's a quote: "Whenever
you shut a human being out of the
world, he builds a better or worse
one of his own."
I: Would you say that the movie is
contemporary political commen
tary — either on the Lynne Ch
eney or Gore-Lieberman request
to Hollywood that movies be less
gratuitously sexual, or on the (llin
ton-Lewinsky scandal — disguised
as historical tale?
PK: We got the script the summer
of the Clinton-Lewinksy scandal.
There were things in the script that
echoed Ken Starr's pursuit of our
Marquis de Sade, Hill (llinton. The
irony and hypocrisy of those who
were after them .... the Marquis
would have loved that. What they

were trying to stop, they had al
ready gone way beyond that.
It was an amazingly timely
thing. We should be able to let
adults see films that are provoca
tive and interesting, and let them
make up their own minds.
This is not a film for children of
all ages. It's very relevant to what
we're all going through now. It
deals with what is permissible in so
ciety, what you are going to allow
people to see. People are drawn to
extreme art; people are interested
in pushing the outside of the enve-'
lope and what that means.
When people try to repress
artists, what happens? Is the re
pression of art worse than the art
itself? Should these types of art be
allowed? Should the Marquis be in
prison?
I think inavbe, yes, but vou also
have to look at his life. 1 le watched
thousands ol people lost.- theii
heads, rivet soI blood beneath him
and that experience forced liini to
be a writer. I Ic's a very interesting
character, that's why he became
fascinating. He wrote so much,
«ni(l had so much work destroyed,
manuscripts lost, banned and
burned.
I: My impression is that this is not
an art-house movie, that it is in
tended for wide release. Do you
think Middle America is ready for
a movie about the Marquis de
Sade? Or is the whole point that
maybe they need to be pushed a bit
by it?
PK: It will be curious to see when it
plays in the South . . . there are
things in the film that will provoke
people. We're hopeful that it will
be .ill over the place. With an R rat
ing, that's possible. But it really is
for college and above.
I was encouraged by the movies
that reached people - like Ameri
can Beauty. And in this election
season, when art and censorship
have become such big topics .... I
hope people will be shocked and
excited. Some people might be
outright turned off, and I respect
that. But there are others who
want to explore life more fully.
And we also have actors people
know, and that might make it easi
er for Middle America to come.
And the ama/ing thing about Mid
dle America is that Bill Clinton is
still the highest rated president, I
think. People realized that there
were different sides of him. People
ate sharp out there, and we have to
trust that they'll understand what
we're doing.
And the focus groups were real
ly bright and almost all said they
would recommend the film. We're
really encouraged by that. They
really understand that the Marquis
is a really complex character.
The film - it's talking about sex!
It's trying to get people to think
about things! It has this element
that Doug Wright, the author,
called "a feeling somewhere be
tween shame and elation."

tinis' time at Charenton. Sade ((ie
offrey Rush) is a creative spirit who
must write as an outlet for his imag
ination. I le is permitted to have ink,
paper and quills by the modern and
humane director of the institute,
Abbe de Coulmier (Joaquin
Phoenix). Madeleine (Kate Winslct)
is the laundry maid who smuggles
out the Marquis' writing lor publi
cation. Dr. Royer-('.ollard (Michael
(-aine) is the cruel physician sent by
Napoleon to oversee the Abbe's new

methods of treating the insane but
also to silence Sade by am means
necessary.
The Abbe and Madeleine are
naively enamored of one another
but irresistibly drawn to the Mar
tinis, who delights in their confu
sion. Dr. Royer-Collard is the ap
parent image ol conventionality,
but Sade pegs him lor an almost
kindred spirit.
When Royer-Collard takes his
c hild-bride to bed and lias frighten
ing enthusiasm lor using torture to
cure the insane, it's clear that Royer
(bollard's crimes are the only delib
erately sadistic actions in the film,
though they run along the same
lines as Sade's words. Simone

1 his is a beautiful movie. It is di

110 stranger to controversy over the
graphic content ol his works, in
cluding "Henry and June," "The
Right Stull" and"The Unbearable

Fat li scene in "Quills" is as deli
cately crafted and shot as a vignette,
and each shot is as perfectly cap
tured asa painting. All the actors are
remarkable in their roles. Kate
Winslet is charming as an innocent
maid, but lor all her naivete she is
not <1 simple stereotype. She ex
plains her hunger for the Marquis'
writing by saying that she could not
be "such a good woman in lile if (she

Joaquin Phoenix's Abbe is also
.in astonishingly good person dur

in his contact with Sade.

the opposite end ol the spectrum.
Mis Royer-Collard is p.iinlul and
surprising to watch; the malevo

work of art. A self-indulgent diva

Sade has a gift lor finding the om

deserves an ()scar — his Sack' is hi
larious and sobering, creative and

larger than life and mortal.
"Quills" is a frightening, disturb
ing and ultimately haunting film,
shocking in its graphic portrayal of
the overlap of violence and sex. Is it
not gratuitous lor the sole reason
that the Marquis de Sade needs to
be expressed in the excess ol the
darkness of the id.
"Quills" does not try to defini
tively answer what society can do
with a person like the Marquis. I It
can be a danger when let loose, but
the consequences of silencing him
may be worse. Peter Kaufman, the
producer of "Quills" and the son ol
director Philip Kaufman, spoke to
the Intermission about this film.
Intermission: What originally drew
you to making a movie out ol Doug
Wright's 191)5 ()hie-winning play?

I'eter Kaufman: lo\ Searchlight
sent the script to lMiil and me, we
read it and we were blown awa\. We
were so surprised that a studio
would want to make a movie about
the Marquis deSade. Ii just seemed
like a challenging, interesting and
provocative story. Its based on real
people. There was .1 laundry lass
who actualh did have an allair with
the Marquis; there was a character
who was at tu.illv out to get the Mar
tinis at all costs. Phil and I worked
together — lie read the script, I
read the script, we looked .it each
other and were strangely elated and
terrified.
I: What would vou say are the major
themes of the movie?
I'K: It's about the struggle between
oppression and creation. Ihe op-

pressor usually becomes the muse
of the artist the oppressor is trying
to silence. [The Martinis is an| un
crushahle spirit of creation. ()< tavio
Pa/, said, "I lis voice is no less extra
ordinary than his work. . . The
philosopher of sadism was not a vic
timi/.er but a victim." What we set
out to do was not whitewash him in
any way . . . .It's an entertainment
lirst of all, but within the entertain
ment it deals with serious ideas
about the nature of being a human.
I: What kind of research did you
do?
PK: There have been lour books in
the last year and a half . . . we've
tried to read all of them. There has
been terrific writing by women on
the Marquis tie Satle, like Angela
Carter and Krancine tin Plessix
Cray. There's a very famous essay
by Simone de Beauvoir called

"Must We Hum Sade?" All the
books are sympathetic to the
human side of Sade, trying to un
derstand his humor. And [shooting]
in England, we had this Acadeim
Award set designer. . . . I le had an
amazing collection ol pornography
from that time Another one had
to pro< ure period dildoes.
I: Do you seethe Marquis de Sade as
a tree spirit who exposed the dirty
secrets <>l his hypocritical so( iety or
as a twisted, sic k individual who
needed support and help?
I'K Hut's reall\ lor the viewer to
decide. I personally I eel that it's
some combination, hut I don't want
to come to some conclusion for the
audience. Our hope is that people
will talk about it afterwards. I hope
people (.in think about il before
the\ pass judgment. We live in this

where everyone wants sound
biles, and I hope this will provoke
thought, lie's a real enigma, the
Marquis, and (.colli ev Rush was
the perfect actor to play the role
he understood the madness, the
loneliness of being in prison, be
kept bis lire burning. It's a very
compelling < haracter. Rush, the
greatest living actor in my mind, re
ally became him .... He showed all
sides, the human side ol the Mar
quis de Sade. The Marquis was in
prison lot half his life, but he wrote
every day, he had this incredible
burning desire to write, to create.
I: Is the role of the artist to shake up
society?
I'K: I think that's one of the roles. I
think that artists are very important.
I was living in Taiwan about 20
years ago, and one person said "art
is not useful." We got in this long
debate. I think art is important and
without art you take away beauty.
Art gives us alternatives to our
everyday life. It allows you to escape
the dullness of just investing money
in the stock market. Artists can
every day reinvent themselves. Art
at its best will make better people of
.ill olUs, get us to a higher level.
The tapestry of life is rich. Not
to be kitchy or corny, but people
need to be shaken up; 1 need to be
shaken up. I need to see art that ex
(ites me and stimulates me.
I he Marquis said something
about how "one must acquaint
oneself with vice to know virtue."
We've got to experience things
that we normally wouldn't want to
experience. Some of the Marquis'
works are unreadable, but some
lead the right way are realh inter
esting and vet ) funny. And he did
believe in a woman's light to con
trol her own sexuality and to use
sex as liberation.
1 really hope this film does
reach bright people everywhere
and that there are discussions
about whether people like the
Marquis are important, or
whether we should not allow peo
ple to see him at all.
112: Films such as "One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest," "Girl Inter
rupted," "Silence of the Lambs"
and "Don Juan de Marco" all also
explore the world inside an insane
asylum, and how so-called normal
people view that world. Why do
you think this has emerged as a
theme, and how does "Quills" lit in
with it?
PK: All the films of insanity lead
you to the quest of what is sane and
what is insane. Was Sade reacting
to the insanity he saw - the French
Revolution?
There's a sense of humor in all
of these films too, because the in
sane have freedom to say things
that we can't say. I think it fits into
that tradition of films of the insane,
and why people are interested.
There's a quote: "Whenever
you shut a human being out of the
world, he builds a better or worse
one of his own."
I: Would you say that the movie is
contemporary political commen
tary — either on the Lynne Ch
eney or Gore-Lieberman request
to Hollywood that movies be less
gratuitously sexual, or on the (llin
ton-Lewinsky scandal — disguised
as historical tale?
PK: We got the script the summer
of the Clinton-Lewinksy scandal.
There were things in the script that
echoed Ken Starr's pursuit of our
Marquis de Sade, Hill (llinton. The
irony and hypocrisy of those who
were after them .... the Marquis
would have loved that. What they

were trying to stop, they had al
ready gone way beyond that.
It was an amazingly timely
thing. We should be able to let
adults see films that are provoca
tive and interesting, and let them
make up their own minds.
This is not a film for children of
all ages. It's very relevant to what
we're all going through now. It
deals with what is permissible in so
ciety, what you are going to allow
people to see. People are drawn to
extreme art; people are interested
in pushing the outside of the enve-'
lope and what that means.
When people try to repress
artists, what happens? Is the re
pression of art worse than the art
itself? Should these types of art be
allowed? Should the Marquis be in
prison?
I think inavbe, yes, but vou also
have to look at his life. 1 le watched
thousands ol people lost.- theii
heads, rivet soI blood beneath him
and that experience forced liini to
be a writer. I Ic's a very interesting
character, that's why he became
fascinating. He wrote so much,
«ni(l had so much work destroyed,
manuscripts lost, banned and
burned.
I: My impression is that this is not
an art-house movie, that it is in
tended for wide release. Do you
think Middle America is ready for
a movie about the Marquis de
Sade? Or is the whole point that
maybe they need to be pushed a bit
by it?
PK: It will be curious to see when it
plays in the South . . . there are
things in the film that will provoke
people. We're hopeful that it will
be .ill over the place. With an R rat
ing, that's possible. But it really is
for college and above.
I was encouraged by the movies
that reached people - like Ameri
can Beauty. And in this election
season, when art and censorship
have become such big topics .... I
hope people will be shocked and
excited. Some people might be
outright turned off, and I respect
that. But there are others who
want to explore life more fully.
And we also have actors people
know, and that might make it easi
er for Middle America to come.
And the ama/ing thing about Mid
dle America is that Bill Clinton is
still the highest rated president, I
think. People realized that there
were different sides of him. People
ate sharp out there, and we have to
trust that they'll understand what
we're doing.
And the focus groups were real
ly bright and almost all said they
would recommend the film. We're
really encouraged by that. They
really understand that the Marquis
is a really complex character.
The film - it's talking about sex!
It's trying to get people to think
about things! It has this element
that Doug Wright, the author,
called "a feeling somewhere be
tween shame and elation."
The Marquis de S;ide would like
to tell you a story. I Ie will whisper it
to you with theseratchingol his quill
pen Ironi behind the walls of a men
tal institute in 19th-century France.
It will he sexually perverse, it will he
violent, it will he disturbing, and you
will want to hear more.
Your curiosity, your desire and
your revulsion are fulfilled while
you sit in a dark room tilled with
strangers. The movie "Quills" tells
the story of the Marquis de Sade's
lile as if it were one of his own dark
and fascinating literary creations.
I he Marquis was a historical fig
ure. A nobleman who barely es
caped the guillotine during the
French Revolution, he would regu
larly whip prostitutes and repeated
1\ raped and brutalized children.
()ur word "sadism" is derived from
his name.
The Marquis de Sade wrote
books — still iu print today, though
banned for obscenity in his century
that, drawing on his sexual expe
riences, explored the underbelly of
the human psyche, lie was also a
man who hated hypocrisy, believed
in abolishing the death penalty and
treasured freedom of expression.
Simone de lieauvoir called him an
important forerunner to Freud.
The Marquis was also a mad
man. lie was imprisoned in the
bastille, witnessed the rivers ol
blood of the French Reign of" Ferror
and spent the remainder of his life
at the Charenton mental institute.

1 his is a beautiful movie. It is di

110 stranger to controversy over the
graphic content ol his works, in
cluding "Henry and June," "The
Right Stull" and"The Unbearable
Lightness of Being."
Fat li scene in "Quills" is as deli
cately crafted and shot as a vignette,
and each shot is as perfectly cap
tured asa painting. All the actors are
remarkable in their roles. Kate
Winslet is charming as an innocent
maid, but lor all her naivete she is
not <1 simple stereotype. She ex
plains her hunger for the Marquis'
writing by saying that she could not
be "such a good woman in lile if (she
were] not such a bad one on the

page.
Joaquin Phoenix's Abbe is also

Mis Royer-Collard is p.iinlul and
surprising to watch; the malevo

work of art. A self-indulgent diva

deserves an ()scar — his Sack' is hi
larious and sobering, creative and

"Quills" is a frightening, disturb
ing and ultimately haunting film,
shocking in its graphic portrayal of
the overlap of violence and sex. Is it

be expressed in the excess ol the

"Quills" does not try to defini
tively answer what society can do
with a person like the Marquis. I It
can be a danger when let loose, but
the consequences of silencing him
may be worse. Peter Kaufman, the
producer of "Quills" and the son ol
director Philip Kaufman, spoke to
the Intermission about this film.
Intermission: What originally drew
you to making a movie out ol Doug
Wright's 191)5 ()hie-winning play?

I'eter Kaufman: lo\ Searchlight
sent the script to lMiil and me, we
read it and we were blown awa\. We
were so surprised that a studio
would want to make a movie about
the Marquis deSade. Ii just seemed
like a challenging, interesting and
provocative story. Its based on real
people. There was .1 laundry lass
who actualh did have an allair with
the Marquis; there was a character
who was at tu.illv out to get the Mar
tinis at all costs. Phil and I worked
together — lie read the script, I
read the script, we looked .it each
other and were strangely elated and
terrified.
I: What would vou say are the major
themes of the movie?
I'K: It's about the struggle between
oppression and creation. Ihe op-

pressor usually becomes the muse
of the artist the oppressor is trying
to silence. [The Martinis is an| un
crushahle spirit of creation. ()< tavio
Pa/, said, "I lis voice is no less extra
ordinary than his work. . . The
philosopher of sadism was not a vic
timi/.er but a victim." What we set
out to do was not whitewash him in
any way . . . .It's an entertainment
lirst of all, but within the entertain
ment it deals with serious ideas
about the nature of being a human.
I: What kind of research did you
do?
PK: There have been lour books in
the last year and a half . . . we've
tried to read all of them. There has
been terrific writing by women on
the Marquis tie Satle, like Angela
Carter and Krancine tin Plessix
Cray. There's a very famous essay
by Simone de Beauvoir called

"Must We Hum Sade?" All the
books are sympathetic to the
human side of Sade, trying to un
derstand his humor. And [shooting]
in England, we had this Acadeim
Award set designer. . . . I le had an
amazing collection ol pornography
from that time Another one had
to pro< ure period dildoes.
I: Do you seethe Marquis de Sade as
a tree spirit who exposed the dirty
secrets <>l his hypocritical so( iety or
as a twisted, sic k individual who
needed support and help?
I'K Hut's reall\ lor the viewer to
decide. I personally I eel that it's
some combination, hut I don't want
to come to some conclusion for the
audience. Our hope is that people
will talk about it afterwards. I hope
people (.in think about il before
the\ pass judgment. We live in this

where everyone wants sound
biles, and I hope this will provoke
thought, lie's a real enigma, the
Marquis, and (.colli ev Rush was
the perfect actor to play the role
he understood the madness, the
loneliness of being in prison, be
kept bis lire burning. It's a very
compelling < haracter. Rush, the
greatest living actor in my mind, re
ally became him .... He showed all
sides, the human side ol the Mar
quis de Sade. The Marquis was in
prison lot half his life, but he wrote
every day, he had this incredible
burning desire to write, to create.
I: Is the role of the artist to shake up
society?
I'K: I think that's one of the roles. I
think that artists are very important.
I was living in Taiwan about 20
years ago, and one person said "art
is not useful." We got in this long
debate. I think art is important and
without art you take away beauty.
Art gives us alternatives to our
everyday life. It allows you to escape
the dullness of just investing money
in the stock market. Artists can
every day reinvent themselves. Art
at its best will make better people of
.ill olUs, get us to a higher level.
The tapestry of life is rich. Not
to be kitchy or corny, but people
need to be shaken up; 1 need to be
shaken up. I need to see art that ex
(ites me and stimulates me.
I he Marquis said something
about how "one must acquaint
oneself with vice to know virtue."
We've got to experience things
that we normally wouldn't want to
experience. Some of the Marquis'
works are unreadable, but some
lead the right way are realh inter
esting and vet ) funny. And he did
believe in a woman's light to con
trol her own sexuality and to use
sex as liberation.
1 really hope this film does
reach bright people everywhere
and that there are discussions
about whether people like the
Marquis are important, or
whether we should not allow peo
ple to see him at all.
112: Films such as "One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest," "Girl Inter
rupted," "Silence of the Lambs"
and "Don Juan de Marco" all also
explore the world inside an insane
asylum, and how so-called normal
people view that world. Why do
you think this has emerged as a
theme, and how does "Quills" lit in
with it?
PK: All the films of insanity lead
you to the quest of what is sane and
what is insane. Was Sade reacting
to the insanity he saw - the French
Revolution?
There's a sense of humor in all
of these films too, because the in
sane have freedom to say things
that we can't say. I think it fits into
that tradition of films of the insane,
and why people are interested.
There's a quote: "Whenever
you shut a human being out of the
world, he builds a better or worse
one of his own."
I: Would you say that the movie is
contemporary political commen
tary — either on the Lynne Ch
eney or Gore-Lieberman request
to Hollywood that movies be less
gratuitously sexual, or on the (llin
ton-Lewinsky scandal — disguised
as historical tale?
PK: We got the script the summer
of the Clinton-Lewinksy scandal.
There were things in the script that
echoed Ken Starr's pursuit of our
Marquis de Sade, Hill (llinton. The
irony and hypocrisy of those who
were after them .... the Marquis
would have loved that. What they

were trying to stop, they had al
ready gone way beyond that.
It was an amazingly timely
thing. We should be able to let
adults see films that are provoca
tive and interesting, and let them
make up their own minds.
This is not a film for children of
all ages. It's very relevant to what
we're all going through now. It
deals with what is permissible in so
ciety, what you are going to allow
people to see. People are drawn to
extreme art; people are interested
in pushing the outside of the enve-'
lope and what that means.
When people try to repress
artists, what happens? Is the re
pression of art worse than the art
itself? Should these types of art be
allowed? Should the Marquis be in
prison?
I think inavbe, yes, but vou also
have to look at his life. 1 le watched
thousands ol people lost.- theii
heads, rivet soI blood beneath him
and that experience forced liini to
be a writer. I Ic's a very interesting
character, that's why he became
fascinating. He wrote so much,
«ni(l had so much work destroyed,
manuscripts lost, banned and
burned.
I: My impression is that this is not
an art-house movie, that it is in
tended for wide release. Do you
think Middle America is ready for
a movie about the Marquis de
Sade? Or is the whole point that
maybe they need to be pushed a bit
by it?
PK: It will be curious to see when it
plays in the South . . . there are
things in the film that will provoke
people. We're hopeful that it will
be .ill over the place. With an R rat
ing, that's possible. But it really is
for college and above.
I was encouraged by the movies
that reached people - like Ameri
can Beauty. And in this election
season, when art and censorship
have become such big topics .... I
hope people will be shocked and
excited. Some people might be
outright turned off, and I respect
that. But there are others who
want to explore life more fully.
And we also have actors people
know, and that might make it easi
er for Middle America to come.
And the ama/ing thing about Mid
dle America is that Bill Clinton is
still the highest rated president, I
think. People realized that there
were different sides of him. People
ate sharp out there, and we have to
trust that they'll understand what
we're doing.
And the focus groups were real
ly bright and almost all said they
would recommend the film. We're
really encouraged by that. They
really understand that the Marquis
is a really complex character.
The film - it's talking about sex!
It's trying to get people to think
about things! It has this element
that Doug Wright, the author,
called "a feeling somewhere be
tween shame and elation."
The Marquis de S;ide would like
to tell you a story. I Ie will whisper it
to you with theseratchingol his quill
pen Ironi behind the walls of a men
tal institute in 19th-century France.
It will he sexually perverse, it will he
violent, it will he disturbing, and you
will want to hear more.
Your curiosity, your desire and
your revulsion are fulfilled while
you sit in a dark room tilled with
strangers. The movie "Quills" tells
the story of the Marquis de Sade's
lile as if it were one of his own dark
and fascinating literary creations.
I he Marquis was a historical fig
ure. A nobleman who barely es
caped the guillotine during the
French Revolution, he would regu
larly whip prostitutes and repeated
1\ raped and brutalized children.
()ur word "sadism" is derived from
his name.
The Marquis de Sade wrote
books — still iu print today, though
banned for obscenity in his century
that, drawing on his sexual expe
riences, explored the underbelly of
the human psyche, lie was also a
man who hated hypocrisy, believed
in abolishing the death penalty and
treasured freedom of expression.
Simone de lieauvoir called him an
important forerunner to Freud.
The Marquis was also a mad
man. lie was imprisoned in the
bastille, witnessed the rivers ol
blood of the French Reign of" Ferror
and spent the remainder of his life
at the Charenton mental institute.
"Quills" is the story of the Mar
tinis' time at Charenton. Sade ((ie
offrey Rush) is a creative spirit who
must write as an outlet for his imag
ination. I le is permitted to have ink,
paper and quills by the modern and
humane director of the institute,
Abbe de Coulmier (Joaquin
Phoenix). Madeleine (Kate Winslct)
is the laundry maid who smuggles
out the Marquis' writing lor publi
cation. Dr. Royer-('.ollard (Michael
(-aine) is the cruel physician sent by
Napoleon to oversee the Abbe's new

methods of treating the insane but
also to silence Sade by am means
necessary.
The Abbe and Madeleine are
naively enamored of one another
but irresistibly drawn to the Mar
tinis, who delights in their confu
sion. Dr. Royer-Collard is the ap
parent image ol conventionality,
but Sade pegs him lor an almost
kindred spirit.
When Royer-Collard takes his
c hild-bride to bed and lias frighten
ing enthusiasm lor using torture to
cure the insane, it's clear that Royer
(bollard's crimes are the only delib
erately sadistic actions in the film,
though they run along the same
lines as Sade's words. Simone
(Amelia Warner), Royer-Collard's
convent-reared teenage wile, is .1
wonderful parallel to Madeleine's
character, both innocents are en
tranced In Sade's writing: ()ne girl
