### MICAH LAPIDUS BILL HUSTON 
Last Sunday we saw one of the
greatest jazz. musicians alive.
Oakland's paramount theater
played host to the British "guitai
god |ohn Mc Laughlin and Re
memhei Shakti, a hand that
sounds like no other.
Amazingly, to linens too much
on McLaughlin would he short
changing the roles ol the other
three virtuoso musicians, who,
with him, formed .1 singular art is
ii< entit) that was hoth biggei
111.111 and distinct li 0111 any one ol
Us parts.
Original!) formed in 1)7,
Shakti, which translates to cre
ative intelligence, beaut) and
power, is a unique hybrid ol In
dian classical music and jazz.
Shoiih aftei graduating 110111
Miles Davis I niversity (In a
Silent Wa\ and hitches Hrew.
I'.)()'.)) and piloting the ultra-sue
cessful jazz-ioc k group, I he Ma
havishnu Orchestra, Mc Laugh 1111
looked east and teamed up with
/akii Hussein, mastei ol liidi.in

I ahla drums.
I'wenty-five years later, the
hand reformed with a slightly dif
ferent name and lineup due, in
part, 10 their inability to locate
the enigmatic L. Shankar, who is
apparently wandering lost some
where on the Indian subconti
nent. Last week's group included
pcrc iissionisi Vinayakram Selva
ganesh and electric mandolin
pla\er I ppahipu Shrinivas.
Nontradiiionallv, the show
started right on time. I he lour
musicians approached the slight
l\ raised plat lotlll 111 the middle ol
the enormous paramount stage,
bowed to the audience, took oil
tlieii shoes and formed a semi
circle, each silling (loss-legged.
I his intimate demeanor, hard to
establish in sue ha large venue, set
a meditative tone Ibi the evening
thai even the obnoxious Lexus .id
draped across the back ol the
stage could not belittle.
Without even the slightest bit
ol eye c out act, I he group
launched into its first number,
one ol several lengths improvisa
tions on llic I ndiau Raga foi 111,

thai were to comprise the entire
ty of the show.
I he night's music was consis
tently compelling. Propelled by
the (hiving heals ol Hussein and
Vinayakram and a steady drone,
the group's music Mowed seam
lessly. Clearly comfortable in
such a sonic environment,
McLaughlin and I ppalapu of
fered up one fiery improvisation
altei .mother, often trading short
lines hack and forth, eac li taking
extended solos in both ol the
lengthy sets.
Although the music rarely
stopped, the quartet covered a
vast expanse ol musical territory
with sounds ranging from
dreamy atmospheric segments to
impossiblx f.isi melodic state
ments to lo< ked eastern grooves
that gave strong hints ol con tem-
electronic as Indian roots.
I oward the end of the first set,
we were even treated to some
vocal hijinks, courtesy of the per
cussionists. ih.it chagged on a bit
too long but nonetheless demon
strated the group's absurd knack
for listening and improvisation.

It is truly hard for us to line)
any point ol critical entry into
Shakti s music. I he band seemed
in jovial spirits .ill night and ex
hibited an interest and selfless
ness that matched their dizzying
musical virtuosity. Ii is truly re
markable to watch a figure like
McLaughlin, one <>112 the most
revered guitarists ever, get lost
inside a percussion solo lor 15
minutes, < lapping time and urg
ing the others on, all without
playing a single note. And such
artistic patience is all the more
amazing when, in the next mo
ment, the music explodes into <1
full band outpouring that leaves
the audience on its feet and
breathless.
The humble musicians re
sponded giaciousl) to the ex
tended standing ovation, bowing
repeatedly and hugging one an
other as the\ left the stage. An en
core would have been superflu
ous; their multilaceted message
was transmitted to every person
in the theater.
11 you c an't tell from our lac k
of sarcastic witticisms, we too

were moved In this performance.
As we wailed for the crowd to dis
perse, sitting beneath the mag
nificent dome of the Paramount,
we felt that this ( oncert was a pel -
led blend of venue and music.
And we feel ii isonl\ appropriate
to leave you with some ol
M< Laughlin's own thoughts:
"I am convinced, as many peo
ple are, ili.it we .ill have divine
origins and that essentially every
thing is divine. We all come from
the one, we are in the one and we
can never be apart from each
other and the one. This is the
personal conviction. It all comes
down to an intellectual game in
the end if you start to consider
truth, goodness and beauty
which are probably the essential
attributes of what we consider
(Jod.
"If something is really true, it
has to be beautiful. And music is
beautiful, so music has to be true.
(.od is the most beautiful of ;tll
the beautiful and the source ol .ill
beauty, so music has to be inti
mately acquainted with (Â»od in
some way."'
