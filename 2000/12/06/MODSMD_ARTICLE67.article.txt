the seasoned veteran.
Hie format is very similar to
"Mario Kart" — you choose one
of 16 characters, mostly Irom
Mario games. There's even a
newly created character, Walui
gi (Tuigi's archnetnesis, much
like Wario is Mario's archnetne
sis). Ka< h character has different
strengths and weakness; for ex
ample, Yoshi has speed but isn't

.is strong, while Boswei has
power hut moves slowly.
I here are also a number of
courts to choose Iroin. Depend
ing on what sm lace you'i e play
ing on, the tennis ball will reai t
with different types ol bounce
and speed, (hanging reaction
time .ind making things .ill the
more challenging.
I hen, you have to c hoose what
type of game you want to play:
exhibition, tournament mode,
several different challenge
modes and special matches. Keat
ing the tournament will unlock
hidden characters and courts,
while non-traditional games like
Ring Shot create specific objec
tives that you must achieve with
in a certain time limit.
Sik ( esslully hitting the tennis
ball through 90 randomh gen
erated in under two min
utes is <i lot harder than it might
sound, and trying to beat it with
every character will take weeks
to accomplish, flic Piranha
Challenge has piranha plants
shooting balls that you must vol
ley back without having the
computer opponent touch
them. The Bowser Stage is like
tennis on acid — a constantly

moving court makes it hard to
understand what's going on. At
the same time, question blocks,
a la "Mario Kart," give you
power ups like turtle shells and
banana peels that you fling at
your opponent while you play.
It's not really tennis, per se, but
it's both entertaining and frus
trating at once, and just another
feature in this game.
Multiplayer mode, however,
is when " Tennis" really shows its
strengths, turning into an excel
lent venue for trash-talking.
There's nothing more satisfying
than acing your friend on a per
fect serve with Donkey Kong or
severely embarrassing him by
smashing the ball in his face
using Princess Peach.
Supporting four-player si
multaneous play, this game is
just another in a long list of solid
multiplayer Nintendo f>4 titles
that make it probably the best
party console out there. "Mario
Tennis" takes full advantage of
its multiplayer mode, in which
you can go one-on-one or play
doubles matches of varying
lengths.
Handicaps allow you to com
pensate for lack of skill, and the

longer you play, the more you
will be able to place the ball ex
actly where you want it to go.
Different combinations of the A
and r> buttons allow for depth in
ball placement and speed, mak
ing a game against your friends
a chess match of videogame
prowess. And it certainly is ful
filling to hear the ref announce
"game, set and match" while you
bask in the glow of victory.
Admittedly, "Tennis" isn't
perfect. Single player can get
old once you've unlocked every
thing there is to unlock, and you
can only hear Peach say "Here 1
am!" so many times before the
voiceovers start to become a lit
tle annoying. And, although the
game's replay value is fairly
high due to the combination of
characters, courts and game
types, tennis is just not a funda
mentally innovative concept,
meaning that you'll probably
get bored with it eventually.
hut make no mistake
"Mario Tennis" will be fun for
most people willing to give it a
try. It's certainly at least worth a
rental. So if you're looking fora
new multiplayer game to suck
up a little time, this is it.
