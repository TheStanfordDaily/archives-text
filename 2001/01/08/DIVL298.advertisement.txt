The Einstein Syndrome is a true gem. In addition
to the latest scientific findings about late-talking
children, it is packed with deep compassion,
uncommon wisdom and unusually helpful
no-nonsense practical advice for parents of
late-talking children. The Einstein Syndrome is
that rare hook that comes along every once in a
while that speaks from both the heart and the
mind and directly to parents of all children who
are different." • SALLY E. SHAYWITZ. M.D.,
