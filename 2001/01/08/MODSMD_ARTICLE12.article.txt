\i Stanford and elsewhere, we in
creasing!) live in a world of 90 degree an

out excrement, as it it simply disap

the clouds, entertainment is <>ui most
(< minx >11 source of infoi mat ion.
I iving in illusion, we're buffered, de
tached, ignorant ol the \lt.ll feedback we
nee< I from 0111 environmental support svs
teins. Sociallv, also, we've become mot e
sheltered from each other. ( ompulersand
inohilitN separate us from the people we
live with, |iist as cement and sewers sepa
-1 ate us 110111 the ground we liveoll. Instead
of interacting with the people around us,
we (an use 0111 ( ell phones to interact with
people more distant. Instead of talking
personalis to someone, we (.111 e-mail
them \ 1 kI when we feel sexy, we can have
"virtual sex. I ess grounded and intimate
in iii.iii\ relationships, we inc 1 case t lie like

We're inundated with opportunities to
live in unreal, virtual worlds. We spend an
iik 1 easing amount ol 0111 time plaving 011
0111 computers and watching om televi
sions, meaning we spend moreol oui days
interacting with neithei the non-human
world, nor humans themselves. In this
world, we often actualb pretei informa
tion that is spec 1 lie all\ unrepresentative of
realitv. < )ui journalists tell us more often
about unusual events than about broad
trends. < >111 entertainers give us special ef
fects and melodramas. Maga/ine covets
aie rnosth digilalh .iltered, airhrushed
photos. We can pretend we're video game
charac tei s who perforin phvsicalh impos
sible feats.
Now, when we do interact with othei
huinans. we iuc reasinglv t,ilk al)out this vir
tual world we'vee reated. We talk about on 1
gi/inos and games. We g< »ssip al»out people
we don't even know, and who probably
don't l ealh c\ist: person.is with permanent
stage names, like IV eliddv and Kramer,
l-.veti when dec iding whom to Ik* 0111 lead
ers. we talk about candidates with "image
problems, people without the "media
sa \ \ \ to "pel foi 111 the role properly.
\ meriiorahle slogan of oui times is
"linage is evei \ thing " So what happens to
us. as we const 1 lie I the illusions of our age?
Ys 0111 world slowb bee oines un-inooi ed
from leality, we 1 isk a painful (1 ash down

I moil goes out of business. I he I itantic
crashes. 1.1.us get trapped. I errorists fol

Sheltered In our computers and <>ui
televisions, we more often take oui social
cues from non-reality. M\ lather, an

When we take too manv c ues from noti

Stanford's Counseling and Psychological
Services, told me last \eai thai shed seen
an "unprecedented numbei" ol rooni
m.ites and dorm-males having trouble
gelling along. She theori/ed that students
who grew up with computet s might incoi

Vet, despite the dangers of illusion,

We are piogiainiuers who will design
the most exciting new video games. We
are journalists 01 111.11 ketei s who will woi k
in an enOi inous and growing public rela

teachers who will teach illusions. We are
engineers 01 product designers who will
furthei sheltei people from the "discoin

vote oui talents not to elucidating deep
triillis but to the art form of the \ge of II
lusions: advertising, an art-form thai se
duces us into believing that buvmg some
thing is always the solution.
We are illusionists.
But wliv feel bad about who we are
w hen we (an also woi kto spi cad t lai it\
Aware that cities are not the woi Id, and
that movie characters are not actual peo
ple, we can receive information more
skeptically. We (.111 practice tilisting oui
own experiences more often, and words
less often. We can become more expen
mental. I hen we can become more cie
ative in how we go about oui dail\ lives.
Psychologists call this awakening process
"self-ac tuali/atioti."
I here is a difference lietween authenti
cally connecting with 0111 natural world
and being sale from natural pel ils I here
is a difference between being honest with
other people and being rude. But I'm not
so concerned about demarcating Mil
80l NDARY.
Because I think we know true connec
tion and honest\ w hen we feel it. And the\
leel so good ! I know the dissatislac tion ol
ancntireh false smile, or a da\ spent in .111
office building, or a day writing e-mails.
But I also know the feeling of looking into
someone's eves and truly c onnec ting with
them. I know the feeling of communing
with a tree, understanding its slowei pace
of living. We know how authentic, fresh
and right these experiences are.
I he real world is a beautiful place to live.
