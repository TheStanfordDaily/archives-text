I n one Willingham, football coach ex

I lere are five reasons nt>t to leave Stan
ford:
I You will leave the program \ou built
when it's on the verge of multiple top-10
seasons. Ami what will vou get fbi leaving
this i ising progiam? A program on the cle
t line. Notre Dame has tradition, and right
now that's all the\ have.
2. I lie expectations at Noire Dame are too
high \t Notre Dame you will not Ik- out
standing, .md in.nbe not successful, with
onlv one or two losses. At Stanford \ou are
praised as a king.
IV South Bend is colder than an Eskimo's
nether regions.
4. I lere you have the opportunity to Ix-gin
your own legacy, rather than just follow
someone else's.

University Presidents a 'special case'
(ihristmas isa season of [X'ace and good
will. Well.. .A s|K'( ial interest of mine is
great men who are then crushed under the
wheel of history. More interesting than
Na|X)leon are noble souls, great idealists
overtaken by events and then publicly re
viled. like llerlxTt Hoover, who spent his

hist sears not at Stanford, where he had
once Ix'en hailed as a student hero, hut far
from here. He and his beloved wife, Lou
I letm 11< H)ver, are buried in the garden of
the Hoover Memorial Librarv, .it West
lit;mi It. lowa.
I niversit\ Presidents are a sjK't ial case.
()ne of the noblest history has known was
Nathan Pusey of Harvard, who died in
November. I fe should have been a hero of
leftist students, since he devoted his efforts
to opening up I larvard to non-affluent stu
dents and providing tlietn with financial
support. Instead, students invaded his of
lu e, and soon after he retired and left I lar
vard. Ihereare main similar cases. ()n any
pretext students demand to see the presi
dent and, if he noes not satish their de
mands. wi ee k his oilu e. We had a case like
that at Stanford. No wondei the record
shows that university presidents hum out

ribly complicated and exac ting job. Presi
dents need even minute of the da\ to do it
propet l\.
Years ago, when a varietN of disputes
began to disrupt campuses. I proposed
the i rcation of the ombudsman's of lite,
unknown at the time. I lie proposa I pro
voked laughter, but it was adopted. A sc
nioi faculty member, |ohn Cioheen, was
appointed ombudsman, and under him
the office functioned well. I lie Stanford
campus has now been the scene of vio
lent riots, and in the reports I have seen
there has been no mention of the om
budsman. Why?
Briellv, the present dispute concerns
10 housckeepet jobs at Stanford Hospi
tal. whit h \ ice President of (iencral Ser
vices Lou S.ikscn plans to subcontract
out. Both sides have good cases, llie
hospital does not went to be involved in
laboi disputes, and the workers object
that the contract workers would have
lower pay and less benefits. I have fre
quently expressed my support for the
nui scs. who have a nine h more difficult,
exacting profe*ssional job. In these times
of widespread linemplovmcnt, the
housekeepers are lucky to have a job,
I)iii then Icelings are umlei stainlahlc.
