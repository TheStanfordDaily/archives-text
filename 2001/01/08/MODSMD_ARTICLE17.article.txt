|ust look at the Cardinal's most recent loss,
Sunday's (jB-f>4 deleat to California onl\ two
davs after Stanlbrd bad beaten the Coldcn
Beat s handily. 82-62.
"We didn't play very well," said Stanloi d
head coach Mike Montgomery "We had
plays inside and we didn't finish, we had
the ball where we wanted to and we didn't
finish .ind again, we missed a bundle ol
tree throws."
Sound lainiliar? I liink ol I ex.is I Innk ol
Brighain Young.
And the loss to Cal, in front ol 12,000
screaming lans at Haas I'avilion, was a liaish
welcome into (he (onlerenc e season.
Ihe good news? Ihe last (inic Stanloi<l lost
a game this early in conlerence pla\ was onl\
two years ago. However, it was against highl\
touted Ari/.ona. I lie Cardinal still has to pl,i\
the Wild( .its twi( e this vear.

()l course, the (iolden Bears hadn't beaten
the ( .iidm.il in 10 previous attempts, dating
b.K k to |.urn.ii \ 1007, and tbev were as hungr\
as ever to end that streak.
"We \soii it with our hearts tonight, said ( al
wingman litian Wethers.

However, with one loss in Berkeley, that
ominous Pandora's box has been opened

he should have made."
Stanford also missed 11 of 34 free throws
.md turned the ball over 19 times.
"For goodness s.ike, our point guards were

I he problem is, with this young Cardinal

|ust look at the Cardinal's most recent loss,
Sunday's (jB-f>4 deleat to California onl\ two
davs after Stanlbrd bad beaten the Coldcn
Beat s handily. 82-62.
"We didn't play very well," said Stanloi d
head coach Mike Montgomery "We had
plays inside and we didn't finish, we had
the ball where we wanted to and we didn't
finish .ind again, we missed a bundle ol
tree throws."
Sound lainiliar? I liink ol I ex.is I Innk ol
Brighain Young.
And the loss to Cal, in front ol 12,000
screaming lans at Haas I'avilion, was a liaish
welcome into (he (onlerenc e season.
Ihe good news? Ihe last (inic Stanloi<l lost
a game this early in conlerence pla\ was onl\
two years ago. However, it was against highl\
touted Ari/.ona. I lie Cardinal still has to pl,i\

Stanford also missed 11 of 34 free throws
.md turned the ball over 19 times.
"For goodness s.ike, our point guards were

I he problem is, with this young Cardinal
team, there is no way to predict how the players
