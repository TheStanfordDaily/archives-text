# Barnes emerges as explosive star
## 
### ARISHA HATCH STAFF WRITER 
Four years ago, |ulius Barnes
was a junior at Rowland High
School. I he confident high
school star was |iisi cocky
enough to make away crowds
hate him and just good enough
to pull it oil .iikl, in the end, earn
their respect.
When the 0-foot-1 Karnes,
with deceiving jumping ability
and a deadly jumpshot, swag
gered to the < harity stripe with a
shot at the league < hampionship
on the line, the home crowd did
everything in its powet to dis
tract him.
lioos, hisses and bleac her
stompings overwhelmed the
small gymnasium. Without liesi
tation, Barnes hit the first free
throw, turned to the home crowd,
placed one linger to Ins lips and
said "slid" with an unbelievable
sense of self-confidence. He then
turned and hit the second Iree
throw without missing a beat.
Over winter break, Stanlbrd
fans were shown flashes of
Barnes' "old" confident self. And
when Barnes is back to his Old
t tic ks, he c an't be stopped.
It was with about eight min
utes to go in the game against
(lalifornia on Frida\ when every
one in Maples realized that he
was in the /one.
Bat nes' career-high 27th point
came oil of a steal, which led to a
poetic HOO-degree layup.
I lie play exuded athleticism,
bringing a smile to the usually
stoic face of Barnes.
It was a Fitting c ap to a streak of
holiday games during which
Barnes stepped up Ins play, prov
ing lie might be the breakthrough
player that Stanlbrd head coach
Mike Montgomery was looking
for earlier this season.
California defended Stanford
star Casey Jacobsen well during
its visit to the Farm, holding him
to seven points. I le was only 2 of 7
from the field and 1 of 3 from be
hind the ark. While Jacobsen's
troubles were partly due to the
double and triple teams he saw all
night, Barnes used the attention
lauded on Jacobsen to find holes
of his own.
"When guys focus on Casey
and Curtis, it gives me the oppor
tunity |to score]," said Barnes. "I
|ust have to go out and make the
most of it every night . "
And for the most part, Barnes
has been making the most of it.
The statistics don't lie. Barnes
was averaging H.. r > points coming

off the bench .it the beginning of
the season. Now .is ,t starter, he
has improved his point produc
tion to I f> per game.
In the last live games Barnes
has shown himscll to be ;i pivotal
role plavei m the overall success
ol tlie (Cardinal.
Simph put, when Barnes is in
the /one, Stanford wins.
(lase in point: In the two games
the Cardinal has lost with Barnes
as a starlet (Brighatn Young and
California), he averaged only
six points.
I lie most glaring and recent
example ol Barnes' importance to
ilus Cardinal s<|iiad is the series
with (lalifornia.
Barnes stored 27. Stanford
won l>v 20 at home. I wo clays
later, Barnes had onl\ seven
points .iml the (lardinal watched
as Cal's equivalent ol the Sixth
Man ( lull, " I he Bern h," i uslied

the floor of I laas Pavilion, ton ing
Stanford to endure chants of
"overrated l>\ an endless sea ol
blue and gold patrons.
Coining oil the disappointing
loss to BYI on Dec. 22, when
Barnes had live points, Stanford
knocked oil then-No. 12 Michi
gan State. Barnes had a 19-point,
four-assist performance against
the- Spartans, providing a much
needed boost of confidence.
"1 think the game against
Michigan State was really a state
ment for us," Barnes said. "My
confident e is as high as it has ever
been here at Stanford. Hopefully
it will sia\ ibis high for the re
in. tinder ol the season."
With the 20-year-old junior as
a prevalent storing threat, it re
lieves a lot of pressure Irom |a

Overall, Barnes seems ninth

"Start ing gives vou confidence,
