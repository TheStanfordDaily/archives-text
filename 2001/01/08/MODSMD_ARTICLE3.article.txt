Labor Action Coalition Co-coordinator
1 .olita Koibal, a junior.
Roibal and others have formed an atl
hot "coalition to stop subcontracting" in
iht" wake of a icontroversial move b\ hos

I nion antl the Stanford American Indian
organization, .is well as the labor ac tion
coalition.

Coalition members first gained I'ni
versitv-wide attention with a protest antl
sit-in, during whit li several students were
at tested. It was then that the students sat
down with I niversit\ President John
llennessy, Provost John Ktchemendy
and new Vice Provost tor Student Affairs

the I niversitN s standards for hiring
practices.
"At that meeting we brought up the
code <>l conduct |lor subcontracting

the I niversity," said sophomore Lctisia
Ramirez ol NILChA. " I hey're willing to
discuss it."
"Stanford will t ontinue to sulnontrac t
but will review the sulKontrat ting it does
to ensure that workers are not being un
fairh treatetl," Awakuni said. "In addi

scll has s.iid that committees are a
waste of time," junior kuusela I lilo
ol I'AS I said. "A committee just
isn't going to c ut it."
I lilo was more pleased with the
concrete progress made in the
meeting with hospital administra
tors— Awakuni confirmed that
S.iksen would require subcontract

I lilo and Ramirez both said that

besides hiking existing wages,
S.iksen said that the human re
sources department and purchas

would begin to form some sort of
committee that would discuss and
set up standards lor future sulxon-

Despite the considerable
progress, some are not yet satis

"SlO.lO is a great improvement,
but it's still not a living wage,"

could onl\ come iu the Ibnn ola
commitment to stop non-union
subcontracting permanenth.
"They have been saving that
they're not going to contract out
any other workers, but we want to
see thai in an agreement, and they
haven't done that," she said. " I liev
can pay [subcontracted workers] a
little bit more mone\. but they still
don't have any rights."
Though he mediated the Dec .
14 meeting, Awakuni emphasized
that "the hospital is an entirely sep
arate enterprise with its own CK()
and board of advisers," and thus
the University has "no direct in
volvement with lilt* subcontracting
issue at the hospital."
"Stanford really has the c hance
to set an example," Roibal said.
"We're happy with the progress . .
there is no reason Stanford
shouldn't be a leader [in fair hiring
practices]."
