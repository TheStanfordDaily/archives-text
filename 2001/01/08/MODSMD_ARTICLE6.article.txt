WAS!IINC.K)N (AP) â€” President
Hush, faring election-year criticism
from Democrats, defended his tax-cut
ting policies vesterday and blamed
emerging federal budget deficits on the
recession and America's war against
terrorism.
He hinted at plans to dramatically
increase spending on the military and
defenses against terrorism.
"It makes sense to spend money nec
essary to win the war. It makes sense to
spend money necessary to protect the
homeland," the president said, calling
those his top budget priorities.
According to congressional officials.
Bush's $2 trillion budget, to be un
veiled Feb. 4, is expected to propose
about $7!l() billion for domestic and de
fense programs, excluding automati
cally paid benefits like Social Security.
That is $24 billion, or 3.4 percent,
above this year's levels.
The president pledged to resubmit
his economic revival package along
with the budget blueprint, winch De

mocrats plan to hold up as evidence
that Bush has failed on the economic
front. After nearly five years of surplus
es in Washington, the president said,
"We mav not balance the budget for
this year."
White Mouse officials said late last
year that the costs of war and battling
terrorism had made annual federal
deficits likely for at least the next
three years.
But Bush's remarks yesterday, in a
rare public session with Federal Re
serve Chairman Alan Greenspan,
marked the first time he had publicly
acknowledged the government's bud
get woes.
Both parties view the I.iggitig econo
my as the key issue in November elec
tions, when control of Congress and
three dozen statehouses will be at stake.
Democrats blame vanishing budget
surpluses on the 10-year. $1.35 trillion
lax cut Bush pushed through Congress
last year. Republicans, led by the presi
dent, are seeking to portray critics of

the package as partisan tax-raisers
"I hope that when (longress comes
back thev will have* listened to their
constituents and that Congress will
realize that America, like me, is tired
of partisan bickering, that we ought to
come together, we ought to unify
around some sensible policy and try
not to play politics with tax relief or
for that matter economic stimulus
pa< kages." Bush said.
Some Democrats have sought to
keep tax breaks for corporations and
aflluent individuals from taking eHect.
Bush says th.it position is akin to advo
cating tax hikes; Democrats strongly
dispute the < haracteri/ation.
"This is ,i partisan blame game and
it has no plat e in the debate about the
future of economic health ol this
country." said Mouse Minority
Leader Richard (Jephardt (D-Mo). "Ii
is going to be hard for us to come to
