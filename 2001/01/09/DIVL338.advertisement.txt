What explains the seeming coherence of the groups? If identities
ore a product of the imagination, why are people willing to fight and

Building Blocks, One at a Time
Professor Hari Manohoron
1 UNIT CR/NC OPTION
First class meeting, Tuesday, January 9, at 4PM in Bldg. 420,
room 48
COURSE DESCRIPTION: For the first time, several frontiers of
physics-based research are reaching a previously unimaginable limit:
the discreteness of matter Applying new technologies in the explo
ration of progressively extreme physical regimes, researchers can
now access the single quanta of matter and energy that provide the
fundamental ingredients of the natural world around us. In our
macroscopic existence, for example, we can measure electric
charge, see light, feel magnetic forces, and observe life and death.
Remarkably, the individual constituents of all of these elements ore
now being accessed and manipulated in state-of the-art experi
ments The list includes single electrons, single photons, single
atoms arid molecules, single magnetic flux quanta, single eneigy
levels, single spins, single vibrational modes, single proteins, and
single strands of DNA Breakthroughs in these fields have captivat
ed practicing scientists, engineers, and the public at large Now, a
new generation of researchers is beinq inspired by the manifold pos
sibilities.
This course seeks to introduce contemporary interdisciplinary
research tied to this genercl theme, and will be ougmented by con
tributions from Stanford scientists who lead many of the efforts.
The course is aimed to provide an accessible survey of the accom
plishments and open questions engendered by the pursuit of knowl
edge at the discrete limit of matter, and will be of interest to stu
dents contemplating performing related research in the future, ond
also to students who want exposure to the cutting-edgeiesearch
now critical to our understanding of nature

Bldg. 300. room 303; HH 2:15-3:30 PM
COURSE DESCRIPTION: What does it mean when someone iden
tifies himself or herself ns white, oi black, or Irish, or American, or
lush American, or Tibetan, oi a human? How are new identities cre
ated and legitimated 7 What does it mean to try on a different iden
tity, i.e., to "pass"? National groups and ethnic gioups are so large
that one individual can know only a small fraction of the group.
What explains the seeming coherence of the groups? If identities
ore a product of the imagination, why are people willing to fight and
die for them? This seminar will require careful leading, consistent
doss participation, a few short papers, and one class presentation
(based on that week's reading assignment), but no exoms.

Building Blocks, One at a Time
Professor Hari Manohoron
1 UNIT CR/NC OPTION
First class meeting, Tuesday, January 9, at 4PM in Bldg. 420,
room 48
COURSE DESCRIPTION: For the first time, several frontiers of
physics-based research are reaching a previously unimaginable limit:
the discreteness of matter Applying new technologies in the explo
ration of progressively extreme physical regimes, researchers can
now access the single quanta of matter and energy that provide the
fundamental ingredients of the natural world around us. In our
macroscopic existence, for example, we can measure electric
charge, see light, feel magnetic forces, and observe life and death.
Remarkably, the individual constituents of all of these elements ore
now being accessed and manipulated in state-of the-art experi
ments The list includes single electrons, single photons, single
atoms arid molecules, single magnetic flux quanta, single eneigy
levels, single spins, single vibrational modes, single proteins, and
single strands of DNA Breakthroughs in these fields have captivat
ed practicing scientists, engineers, and the public at large Now, a
new generation of researchers is beinq inspired by the manifold pos
sibilities.
This course seeks to introduce contemporary interdisciplinary
research tied to this genercl theme, and will be ougmented by con
tributions from Stanford scientists who lead many of the efforts.
The course is aimed to provide an accessible survey of the accom
plishments and open questions engendered by the pursuit of knowl
edge at the discrete limit of matter, and will be of interest to stu
dents contemplating performing related research in the future, ond
also to students who want exposure to the cutting-edgeiesearch
now critical to our understanding of nature
