Members [of the band Man or Astro
Man ?/ have gone b\ low-budget super
hero names — Coco the Electronic
Monkey Wizard on bass, Birds tuff on
drums — for so long that their birth
identities are all but erased.
Oi'er time the Man or Astro-Man?
sound has gotten more rock-oriented,
but the song titles are still spillover
from physics class . . . The madden
ingly titled Song of the Two-Mile Lin
ear Particle Accelerator, Stanford
University, Stanford, California is
nothing more than a high-pitched
whammy-bar joyride. . .
The only sounds remotely close to
this on the Stanford campus are com
ing from frat row. Don't be fooled by
the big words.

The Houston Chronicle
