Published Since ISO I

Todav marks not only the first
clay ol c"lasses I'm winter quar
ter, hill also llu- beginning ol
winter gloom (bat will pervade
(his campus lor (lie- next three months.
While many ol ns haye ahead) pur
chased our books (and some may even
open (hem (his week), mam others
have vet to even figure out which ( hiss
es they will take.
A <111i< k giant e at the ( loni se bulletin
lime Schedule reveals that there are
many more class offerings as well .is
major requirements in winter than in
the autumn or spring quarters.
It appears that professors and entire
departments have decided tli.it wintei
quarter should be the most serious, ac a
clemicalK oriented time .it Stanford.

And students have also decided this for
themselves as (hey bulk up their sched
ules to 20-plus units of rigorous c lasses.
\\ hat s strange about this annual tra
dition is that the reason most often
< ited for buckling clown during winter
quarter is the weather. (Conventional
wisdom holds that winter is the rainy
season .it Stanford. Indeed, seniors still
remember the I I Nino storms ih.it
lloocled (ireen Library and mam dor
mitories. Winter is also the coldest sea
son .it Stanford. But, honestly, how
nine li rain and cold are we talking
about ?
Kveii I I Nino winters have mam davs
of sunshine and temperatures in the
lid's. 1 n an average winter, these balim
davs are pie lit ilul. ( .0111 pare our w cat h

er to the months of sub-fi ec/ing tem
peratures and frosty precipitation en
dured by our peers in the Northeast
and Midwest. 1 his year, even schools in
Texas and (Georgia are suffering snow
and i< e storms. We are among the few
luckv souls nationwide that are immune
to winter s most bitter bite. Yet we per
sist 111 hanging our heads in sorrow,
driven to find happiness in .1 heavier
t nurse load ea< h winter.
( ) 11 the othei side ol ibis Stanford
winter mentality, we envision spring as
the time for academic fluff, in def'er
ence lo a campus-wide spirit of indul
gent jubilation. I low ever, while t here is
rcrtainh more outclooi activity in the
spring, this campus hardly becomes
some kind ol org v. We mav be more in-

( lined i<> spend time outside, but many
<>l us are just doing our schoolwork
nonetheless. In fact, Stanford students
seem to find comfort in the idea of a
three-month period of hibernation in
which they can grind away before frol
ic king in the meadows come April.
Because doesn't rain around the
clock, students should take advantage of
our glorious non-winter days. If you
wake to find the sun shining, take off for
11, ill Moon Hay. Be sure to save some
time fora few weekend ski getaways.
And even it it does rain, you can always
opt for an evening of mud sliding.
Don't let the self-perpetuating air of
winter depression infect vou, too. The
work-plav balance should be a state of
mind, not a change of seasons.
