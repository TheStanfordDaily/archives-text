Stanford should assume responsibility for
Webb Ranch workers
('.otisider this spectacle: President |ohn
I leiuiessN shuts down Webb Ranch, and
the men. women and children who have
livetl there foi vears are throw 11 out on the
street.
Impossible? Your Dec. b ston ("Webb
Ranch lease status tbi 200'J sta\s undet id
ed: llennessv sa\s I' niveisit x wants flcxi
bilitv of short lease for the farm") sa\s the
administration lias not decided whethei 11
will renew the Webb lease when il expires
Aug. H1. 2001. then quotes President I len

nessx as disclaiming "responsibilin for the
workers cmplovetl b\ third parties who
lease lantl from Stanford, whether those
workers are at the Stanford Research In
stitute. the Stanlord Shopping ('.enter,
Webb Rant h or elsew here."
Stanford's farm la!>01 camp should cei -
tainh cease to exist next \e.ll .hut there are
oln ions diilercnt es between fai 111 woi kers
and M.k \ s entplovees. Instead ol hiding
behind legal let 11 nit .iluics. would 11 not be
more seemh lor Stanford to assume re
spousibilitN lor the people of Webb
Ranch?
llie I niversih could oiler the small

number ot permanent residents there jobs
at Stanford. Assistant groundskeepers, for
example, start .it over Sl.'t an hour, with
full benefits. 1 Ins would double the pav of
Webb workers overnight and provide
them with health and other benefits they
have nevei enjoyed. We urge President
I lennessy to list- above the example of his
predecessors and teach Stanford students
a proper lesson.
