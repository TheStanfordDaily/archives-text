Big bad Arizona was no match for Stanford and the
Collins twins Saturday, as senior Jarron and junior
Jason (above) combined for 41 points and 21 re
bounds to help the men's basketball team to its first
win at the McKale Center since 1996

A stellar performance from Exaltacion on the bal
ance beam pushed the senior gymnast to a fourth
place finish in the all-arouncf competition at the
Super Six Challenge in Alabama. Stanford finished
third in the event, behind Georgia and Alabama
