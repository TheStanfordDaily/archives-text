Fellowships And Graduate Research Assistantships
For 2001-2002
The John D. and Catherine T. Mac Arthur Consortium in International Peace and Cooperation provides
fellowships and research assistantships for doctoral students working on dimensions of change affecting interna
tional peace and cooperation in contemporary global society.
Funding will go primarily to doctoral students at Stanford. All applicants must show the connection between their
work and one or more of the following dimensions of change affecting international peace and cooperation in
global society:
war and peace in historical context
global governance and transnational norms
environmental sustainability and social justice
production, performance, and representation
of identities.
Historical work that can illuminate these dimensions is eligible for funding. In all cases, the relevance to
contemporary issues of international peace and cooperation must be suited explicitly in the application. Eligible
disciplines include, for example, anthropology, economics, education, engineering, history, law, political science,
psychology, and sociology.
