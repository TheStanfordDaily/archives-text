( )n |an. 10. 19t>4. The Daily published

I .living (llasses."
hi ilit' latest issue ot I lie lacult\ Stall
\ewsletlei Protessoi Lewis Spit/, chairman
o! the ( oniniittec oil Public Kxercises, com
ments, I estimate that most ot the programs
are attended. |iist as most ol the extra-cur
i kiil,ii activities are done, b\ that lOper
i fiit ol the student both who are the real ac
tivists.. .
"Rathci than < lilting back on program

p.K itv, and reach toi an expansion ot the 10
percent and.i drawing-ill ol those students
who attend not .it all oi rareh ...who are
spending most ol then tree hours milling

stjiiii i el-i aging n through their own mis
conceptions in uninspiring bull sessions."
. I Ins (iu.ii tei s sot ial c alcnclar is one
ol the finest in |>.isi vears. and stands as elo

"... With tlu- i u hness ol this quarter's
oppc>rtunities, the student's obvious solu
tion is Io reverse Pre tfesscn Spit/'s estimate:
1 0 percent ol the student bod\ should tor
ni.ilK em oil in classes, the c >t her 90 perient
should audit, attend .ill tilt* events of worth
on the c ainpi is and do i elateil reading. For
II <uil\ 10 percent ol us partake ot the events

naught an\ w.t\."
Bottom line: The Daily headline that every student
has been wishing for.
