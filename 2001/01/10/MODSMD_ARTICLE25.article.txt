Addressing new ethics questions.
Last year, the National Institutes ol
Health issued new guidelines toi govei 11-
nient funding of research into cmbrvonic
stem cells. Stem cells are undifferentiated
cells present in the nasi ent stages of enibi \ -
onie development. As the precuisois to a
host of more specific ccll-t\pcs — such as
heart tissue cells and skin cells — stem (ells
offei tremendous potential for the treai

inent of in.ijoi diseases. 111 theoi v, stem cells
could be used to regenerate spinal tissue,
portions of the eve and even brain tissue.
\s part of the strict guidelines, the Nil I
forbade am experimentation on ac tual em
bryos. but allowed research on stem cells
harvested during the initial stages of 111 vino
fertilization — cells that would have been
dest roved anvwa\ (onlv a select few survive
to be implanted 111 the expe< taut mother).
Hailed l>\ scientists, the new guidelines
nonetheless caused a firestorm of contro
versy. with the Vatican issuing a slinging
denunciation and leading Republicans
threatening legislative action. Some anti
aboition gioups equated ihc research with
nitirclei.
No doubt. 1 lie collirovcrsv created bv the
