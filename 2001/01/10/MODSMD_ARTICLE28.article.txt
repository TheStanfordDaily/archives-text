I lie wireless market has served
.is tlit- battleground for one ot the
most hotlv contested standards
wars in technology history. I he
struggle over which telecommuni
cations prottxol will emerge the vi< -
tor has readied .1 global stale, tost
ing investors and consumeis mil
lions ofdollars in the prot ess.
What's .it st.ike is a considerable
piece of the information infiastrut -
lure of the future and a si/able rev
enue stream associated with that
control. History has been good to
victors of similar contests, namch
Microsoft, Intel. AT& 1\ Son* and
others, but whether this standards
war is bencfinal to consumers is less
apparent.
In the U.S. wireless industry,
three digital standards compete
for customers: ( DMA (rode clivi
sion multiple access), I DMA
(time division multiple access)
and GSM (global system for mo
bile communications). Standards
represent the electronic format
used to send and receive signals

foi wireless <lc\ it es.
(aurcntlv, wireless (.imeis
(i.e. A I & I Wireless and Sprint
IV.S) .iiid most mobile phone
handsets are designed to oper
ate 011 onl\ one of these three
standards.
('.DMA is .1 tcclmolog\ devel
oped in part In Qualconmi and
based on military coniniunica
iions standards. Boasting lower
installation costs and liighct <a
pac itv, ( '.DMA offers a (heapcr
operating mt>dcl and more pri\a
cv through greatei security fea
tures. Backcd In major plavers
Sprint. Bell Atlantic, (ill-, and
Airtoueh. ( I )\l \ is a propt ietarx
standard, meaning that eacli
phone sold generates license rev
enue for Qualeomm.
I DMA is an older variation
but is backed by AIXI and has
significant market penetration.
1 DMAs usage of the wireless
spectrum is less efficient, but its
popularitv remains strong as it
vies with (IDMA for the greatest
market share in the I nited States.
(»SM is the least coinnion stan

dard 111 the nation and is onlv
hat ked by lesser known
providers, such as Voice Stream.
()riginating in No'thern Kurope,
(iSM was the product of coopera
tive efforts f)\ the region's wireless
service providers. As the onlv op
tion available to Kuropeans, the
protocol grew tjuit kly and easily
tlominatc's I DMA and ( DMA in
the global market.
While both Kurope and Asia
have now < <>11 verged on (ISM, the
I nited States, continues to
between the three. (iarriers of
each standard have made signiti
cant non-transferable invest
ments 111 their respective proto
cols and have allied to create pow
erful lobby ing organizations.
I his outcome is the protlut t of a
market-based approach to stan
dards setting, the protess deliber
ated chosen In governing Ihklics
in the I nited States.
I he current situation (lifters
mai kedly from the very first form
of wireless private communica
tions: the analog tellular phone.
Originallv. the Federal Commu

nications ( oniniission, whit h over
sees U.S. communitations stan
dards, established a common proto
col for wireless analog transmis
sions that allowed all carriers to col
lect ivelv work toward establishing a
brand-new industn. Sut h coopera
tive efforts yielded the fastest built
and most pervasive wireless com
munit ation network in the country.
()ther nations lagged fat behind for
several \ears before gaining net
works ot a similar scale.
Kven today, more advanced
U.S. digital phone networks
(sin has CDMA, I DMA and
GSM) cannot provide the cover
age ofleretl the existing domestic
analog infrastructure.
