"We've never seen a growth like this in am

According to Fit/patrick, the
short supph ol skilled photonics
engineers could c ripple the highh
promising technologv, which is
also currently used in products
such as digital cameras and com
pact discs. I)espite the possibilities,
Millei s.iid that at photonics con
ferences, there arc* often < >nl\ luin

"It is very important that we
continue the basic researc li in uni
versities," Miller told the Stanford
Report. "With the rapid growth of
markets and the short develop
ment cvcles of photonic products,
[the] industn lias less time to clo
research. It is also vcrv important
that we train the next generation
of photonics professionals with the
broad skills needed In industrv."
l o promote industn involve
ment, corporate partners will be
invited to join the centers' adviso

rv boards.
Fit/patrick said lit* hopes the
new institutes .it Stanford and
Duke will "attract great students
and great fat uity with great labs,
ad\.nued curricula and industry
internships." and entourage other
universities to create photonics re
search programs.
Ihe Fit/patricks also empha
sized the benefits of joint research
between Stanford and Duke.
"An impoi taut factor in our de
cision to in.ike twin gifts is the po
tential for collaboration between
these two great universities and
the opportunity to quickly in
i l ease the number of graduates
coming into the field," l\itt\ I it/-
