Memorial Auditorium
Featured on the cover of Dance Magame's millennium issue, Ronald K Brown is considered
one of today's hottest and lasting choreographers. Tout athleticism; brash, sassy, high energy
dancers; and a keen sense of movement set Ronald K Brown's work apart "Racism, AIDS, love
and loss. No choreographer has a corner on these themes, of course, but Ronald K Brown
delves into them with originality as well as passion. Few today can match the depth of his obil
ity to many message and medium" observed the New York //mes S20/S26/S32
Thursday-Saturday
February 1-3, 8 00 p.m.

long before Stomp took to the stage, Kodo was thrilling oudiences with the high
powered, rapid fire artistry of taiko drumming—from rhythmically complex
whispers to booming roars. "Each drum stroke is part of a choreographed ritu
al, and athletic pageantry is as important as sound," says the Los Angeles Times
