If beauty is in the eye of the behold
er.; the folks at the San Jose Museum of
Art are pretty confident in Merrill
Falkenberg's beholding abilities. She's
the new associate curator for the mu

a concentration in contemporary and
media arts — both from Stanford.

ment, chief curator Susan Landauer
said: 'We are delighted to have Merrill
join us. Not only does she have a dis
tinguished scholarly background, but
she has the adventurous curatorial
imagination we were looking for.'
