lo be fair, mam Stanford students do have
the opportunitv to link their academic work to
the widei world, whether through extr.u urric

In this (apacitv, the lliston Department s
outreach should serve as a model lor the rest <>1

I his is not to suggest that more sedate,
non-panic ipatorv, informative events like
this series arc more desirable than contro
versial ones sikh as the Department s well
intentioned teach-ins, sue b as the recent one

regarding the crisis in the Middle Kast.
While it inav have benefited from better ex
ecution, that event nevertheless served the
admit "able cause ol educating students on a
tinielv and pertinent issue through open
discussion.
I lie large turnout should quell the most fre
quent opposition to such outreach, nainelv, .1

the students.
()ther departments need to follow suit, espe

would 110 doubt appeal to the curiosities ol

I fearing professors give independent lec
tures on tln ii research (such as the findings of
a psychology study or the eflects of tlie publish
ing industry on literan output) would help
bridge the theory of the classroom with the
more mundane realities of the world outside
Stanford.
Kducation is not only a process of mutual out
reach but one of practical learning. Students
must take the initiative to seek out professors,
but academics also have a responsibility to en
gage students and explain how the knowledge
the\ receive in the classroom can tarry over into
their lives after graduation.
(College should not be a four-plus year hiatus
from the real world. The efforts of the I fistorv
Department, then, deserve applause as well as
emulation.
