When we gel (allied awa\ with out

hui passion, like lire, illuminates and
burns in equal degrees. Friends last fora

Passion is made out to be the enerm of
moderation. If von are passionate about
something, von're supposed to do it. lor
those in the cult of passion, it is unthink
able that a passion should lead to am thing
other than a career. If von like writing po
etry, it becomes a crime to do anvthing
other than stud\ creative writing and be
come a poet. Doing what von like takes
precedence over all other considerations.
Our use of passion can seem empty

when we leave lot \.nation. During that
lime, inn passionate college sell sleeps in

li seems strange that von could have

We < an vm itc oil the rest ol the world as
cniirclv dispassionate and vow to live in

one without its negative consequent cs.
I he need loi the lire ol passion in oin litt

Anothei altei native is to give passion a
place alongside the otliei things that com
pose oni lives, Irom high school dreams to
oui lilturc careers, and friends both pre
sent and past, li would mean reclaiming
oui selves as w holes i athei than an aggre

We live in a socictv that has relegated
the use ot the iclea ol "character" to pettv
debates ovci who should oi should not be
running the government. We have
stopped thinking ol ourselves as charac
ters who cncompass our own histories, oui
work and. ves. our passions.
Instead, we allow ourselves to answci
the cjiiestion, "W ho are you?" with "1 love
reading Virginia Wool!," or "I'm with An
dersen ( onsulting." We have let roles be
come identities.
I think it no coincidence that "passion"
is derived from a word that means "suffer
ing." W hen we make passion the onlv
measure fora life well-lived, it becomes
onlv too easv to forget that we are much
more than that which we desire, that
which we do and that which we think.
I o lose sight of our entire character is
to live in a constant sense of imbalance,
where we exist in our roles .is students,
friends and employees, but never as
out selves.
