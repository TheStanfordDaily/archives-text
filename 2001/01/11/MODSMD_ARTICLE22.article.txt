lint this is Stanford I niversitv, which is used to
being ranked No. I in nearlx everything — everxihing
except for men's basketball. And so the question must
be posed: Does it make a diHerence?
A (onvint itig toad sweep last week ot the At i/ona
schools, combined with a loss In previous \o. I Mulli

rules.

Stanford's excellent roster
depth would seem to spell doom
for a depleted ()Sl team, but as
usual Montgomery refuses to
take an\ thing lot granted.
"We're not losing to anvbodv.
but we're going to lose to some
body." he said.
"The problem is, von don't
plot out a season. We might lose
to the lOth-place team in the
league. Kvervbodv's capable of
beating vou. I he time that some
body's playing t lieu best and we
are less than our best, we'll get
beat."

tendon showed only "normal

Montgomery.
