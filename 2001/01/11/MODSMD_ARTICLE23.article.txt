No. 5 Volleyball dominates opener with Wildcats up next
By EZRA CALLAHAN
STAFF WRITER
The Stanford men's volleyball team's
first opponent of the 2001 season ma\ not
have been the most formidable of com
petitors.
Still, few can argue that there is any bet
ter way to start a season than b\ thorough
ly demolishing the other team in your first
game.
That's exactly what the No. 5 Stanford
squad (1-0) did in its season opener on
-1 uesdav night in Maples Pavilion, with
IVYouville College (0-1) serving as the un
fortunate victim.
It took the Cardinal just over an hour to
sweep the Spartans, winning its first match
under the NCAA's new scoring system of
rally-scoring games to 30 points with game
scorn of SO-12,90-16 ana 30*16.
Not surprisingly, head coach Ruben
Nieves was very pleased with his team's
performance.
"It was good to see us come out and
take charge earlv," Nieves said. "I didn't
see anv nervousness from our players, and
we let IVYouville know it was going to be a
short night for them."
Stanford dominated the Division 111
Spartans in every facet of the match.
On offense, the Cardinal out killed
IVYouville 47-19 and with only 12 errors
in the match posted a solid .427 hitting
percentage for the match.
The Stanford attack was well spread
with five players tallying five or more kills,
led by sophomore outside hitter Billy
Strickland with eight kills and a .700 hit
ting pen cntagc.
"I think we're going to have a much
more balanced oflense [tins season]," said
sophomore outside Intici ( ml I'oppel
who picked up seven kills .nul a service
ace. "It's what makes us ,i bettet team this
year. If we're going to ha\e a shot at a
championship, we need to gel evervone
the same numbei of sets.
Stanford's defense was ,ils<> strong in
the male h, outdigging the Spai tans 2.V 1 7
,md forcing IVYouville to commit SO hit
ting erroi s on the night. I he Spartans had
negative hitting percentages in all three
games, leading them to a -.143 mark for
the mate h.
()n top of e\er\ thing else, Stanford out
blocked IVYouville 13-4. Nieves sees his
teams blocking .is one of its most im
proved areas.
" I onight's performance follows up on
a preseason where we outblocked oppo
nents consistcntU ." he said. "Dlockingcan
realh intimidate opponents and it hasn't

making tins the most significant
alteration ever to the I niversitv's
hallowed baseball grounds: It is
not yet finished, with the season
set to begin in just over one week.
While workers continue to
pour (oik i ete and the Inundation
foi the seating nears completion,
the team cancelled the annual
Alumni (lame, scheduled to take
place on Saturday, due to dela\s
in the < on si i iic lion.
I hat clc-cisioii moved the new
stadium's debut to a three-game
home series with Fresno Stale
Jan. 26-28.
II owever, projec t ions by
(:lu is (ilass, ( reatot of the Stan
lord llaschall I nolfic ial W eb Site
111at has consulted wit h < < »i 1 si i ik -
tion workers daily, hold that onl\
the stadium's lowei level seats
will be finished b\ the time the

Bulldogs roll into Palo Alto. I his
situation creates at least the po
tential foi the series to be moved
to Fi esno.
"It looks like the lower sections
could be ready by then," he said.
"But with the remaining work
to be finished conic Jan. 2(i, the
question remains it the city 01
< ount\ would allow <>c < upancy of
the stadium with construe tion 011-
going."
(■lass predicts .1 more likely
Opening Day at the new Sunken
Diamond to be a major non-con
fereiic e date with Florida State 011
Feb. 9-11.
With that hurdle still looming
several weeks awav, what is cer
tain m Sunken Diamond's future
is that a new look should attract
fans din ing what < ould potential
ly be <1 diflic ult season fin the ( .11 -
dinal on the field.
I he renovations, when lin
ished, could Ik- the most dramatic
c hanges made to the historic ball
park since its fenc es were moved in

from 500 feet in tenter to 400 in
1966.
Another recent change to
Sunken Diamond was the 1990
addition ot eight lighting towers
around the field, giving Stanford
the capahilit\ to host night games
for the first time, a relatively late
addition in the modern baseball
era.
I he field at Sunken Diamond
was not tout lied during ( onstrut -
tion, aside from .i small area be
hind home plate used as .i staging
area t<>i the workers.
1 his meant tli.it fall ball and
regular practices, which began
Monday, could take place on .i
normal s< hedulc.
All renovations were done
around the plaving surfac e. Most
prat tices have taken plat e on the
11sti.iI grass field surrounded b\
piles ol <liit. making foi .in inter
esting pi eseason expei ient e.
