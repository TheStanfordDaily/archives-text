### EZRA CALLAHAN STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's volleyball team's
first opponent of the 2001 season ma\ not
have been the most formidable of com
petitors.
Still, few can argue that there is any bet
ter way to start a season than b\ thorough
ly demolishing the other team in your first
game.
That's exactly what the No. 5 Stanford
squad (1-0) did in its season opener on

-1 uesdav night in Maples Pavilion, with
IVYouville College (0-1) serving as the un
fortunate victim.
It took the Cardinal just over an hour to
sweep the Spartans, winning its first match
under the NCAA's new scoring system of
rally-scoring games to 30 points with game
scorn of SO-12,90-16 ana 30*16.
Not surprisingly, head coach Ruben
Nieves was very pleased with his team's
performance.
"It was good to see us come out and
take charge earlv," Nieves said. "I didn't

see anv nervousness from our players, and
we let IVYouville know it was going to be a
short night for them."
Stanford dominated the Division 111
Spartans in every facet of the match.
On offense, the Cardinal out killed
IVYouville 47-19 and with only 12 errors
in the match posted a solid .427 hitting
percentage for the match.

led by sophomore outside hitter Billy
Strickland with eight kills and a .700 hit

sophomore outside Intici ( ml I'oppel
who picked up seven kills .nul a service

negative hitting percentages in all three
games, leading them to a -.143 mark for

()n top of e\er\ thing else, Stanford out

teams blocking .is one of its most im
