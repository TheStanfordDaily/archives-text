1955
On Jan. 12, 1955, The Daily published
an article about a possible postal rate raise.
"President Kisenhower asked Congress
today to raise postal rates and grant some
I ,">OO.(MM) civil serviie and postal employees
.in average live percent pay increase costing
ilic government about $394 million.i year.
"While Mr. Eisenhower did not sellout
the proposed rate increase, the administra
tion wants to raise the It-cent postage on
out-of-town letters to 4 c ents and increase
the c harge for .iii mail from 0 to 7 cents.
I his would (ost the public about mil
lion annually.
"Democratic Congressional leaders inl
ine-dutch opposed the mail rate hikes, es
pc( iall\ on first c lass mail, and raised 'grave
doubt' thc\ would be approved. Both Re
publicans and Democrats predicted some
kind ol federal pay raise, perhaps higher
than Mr. Eisenhower suggested."
Bottom line: Little did they know a mere 46 years
later, that the postage would be eight times the
rate they were considering.
