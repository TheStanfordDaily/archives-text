Fed up are ya? Ready to throw in
the dish towel? It seems more than
half of America is afflicted with the
football disease. They watch it, they
read about it, they devour it. It can
leave those on the outside feeling os
tracized.
But before abandoning all hope,
here's comes something from the cant
beat-'em-join- 'em school. Former Stan
ford star and current Minnesota
\ ikings linebacker Kailee Wong and
his mother; Linda, have written a
book, "Mom's Guide to Watching
Football."
It breaks down football in simple
terms, with quotes from Wong and his
teammates about the essentials of
their individual positions.
Linda watched hundreds of games,
took notes and then had her questions
answered by Kailee, who came up with
the idea of going to teammates to
break down their positions.
