I in not kidding. If \on saw an\ of

think ih.it reporters are overlooking the
signitu .iih e of Western attire.
C.owbo\ hats ha\'e theii distinctive

you spend .ill da\ herding cattle undei
( loudless skies. I here arc a l< »i of farmers,
ranchers and othet folks laboring out in
the fields who weai cowlxn hats for ven
pr.utK.il reasons. Kvervone else we.us
them to l<»ok 01 because tlu \ are
prematurcK bald.
I <>1 an illustration of'this phenomenon,
|iisi pic k up two |ohn Wa\lie movies, s.i\
"Sands of I wo |iina ' and " 11 ue (u it." I he
Duke was always .1 bad-ass in his movies,
but he death looks toughet in Westerns
like " I rue Cu ii" than he does 111 war
movies like "Iwo Jinia. li s all about the

I'm a (lore supporter, and I've never
worn ( owho\ hats 01 ( owho\ boots. When
I look ba< k ai the cle( lion, it's 110 wonder
whv we lost. Hush supporters look so
much toughci than us! I hc\ ve got the
hats, the guns. the big 11 ik ks What are we
supposed lo do?
Among the people who wear hats to
look tough and conceal male-pattern bald

ness are main members of the law en

wa\ I'atrol, lot example, wears cowhc>\
hats.
A week ago I w.is pulled ovei foi going
71 in.i (i r > mph /one, and the guv asked
me to step out of the ( ai. Me sti titled ovei
and palled me down foi weapons and
then had me sil in lns( i nisei 11easked me
where I was headed, and I s.iid, " I he ail
poi I." Me aske(l ine w here I was flung to,
and 1 s.ud. "Stanford. Me asked where
Stanford w.is, and I said, "( lose to San
Francisco." I le asked w here San Francisco
was. 1 said. "\i( e hat."
II von ( an t be sniai t, von might as well
look tough.
I've even seen pi( Hires of bush himself
in a eow'hoN hat. Most of tliein show him at
Ins ranch in ( a awforcl. I e\.is. but I'm
sure lie puts it on at night and talks to the
mirroi: "II \on can't be smart, (ieorgc,
noii might as well look tough."
(!owbo\ hats signil\ toughness and
male-pattern baldness, hut the\ also rep
resent the (oninion man, the man who
makes his living In the sweat of his brow. A
man w ho drives a pic knp and hauls lieaw
things around \ i eal man.
If there is am lesson that liberals and
progressives must learn from thisclec lion,
am silvei lining to the cloud of old-time
conservatives who now control all three
braiK lies of govei nnient, it's that we need
something to make us look tough. I'm not
saving that it must be a hat, either. I sup
pose am tvpe of app.u el would suffice, as
long as libel als and progressives could see
each othei wearing it and draw strength
ftoin their utut\.
Fin going to go out on a limb and sav
that tic-dved shirts and scrunchv skirts
won't do the trick. Hit kcnstoc ks and hemp
bracelets aren't going to cut it. Fuel-effi
(ient veliic les and reusable shopping bags
won't help us win. We need something
that looks tough, like a c owbo\ hat.

I lot i/ontal stripes? Am ideas?
