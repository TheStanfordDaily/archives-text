# Bench jump-starts Stanford offense
## 
### SAMEER AHMED EDITORIAL STAFF 
(liven how the Cardinal's
starters dominated Arizona last
weekend, Stanford fans had
high hopes fora repeat perfor
mance last night. Instead, the
Cardinal had to rely on its bench
to bail it out in a tough first half
against ()regon State.
In the first eight minutes of
the game, the Cardinal made five
turnovers, committed four fouls
and stood around on defense as
Oregon State ate up the shot
dock (while putting everyone
else to sleep) to take a 7-1 lead.
l he starters' sluggish plav
forced head coach Mike Mont
gomery to turn to his bench —
the same bench that scored a
combined zero points in the Car
dinal's win over Arizona last Sat
urday.
lint considering the Beavers'
tough team defense and
painstakingly slow offense, exact
ly opposite of the Wildcats,
Montgomery's decision to put in
fresh legs had a chance of work
ing.
Sophomore guard Julius
Barnes made sure it did.
Two minutes after Barnes en
tered the game, he nailed a
jumpei from the free-throw line,
Stanford's first field goal.
Barnes was just warming up.
While one might expert swing
men Casey Jacobsen and Ryan
Mendez (both over 45 percent
from three-point range) to shoot
the Cardinal out of a slump.
Barnes, only 2H.1 percent from
downtown, decided it was his
turn.
In the first half, Barnes lit up

the floor, making four of five
shots, including two three-point
ers, even one from Casev Jacob
sen's range.
"[My offense] has alwavs been
there," Barnes said. "But 1 think
with my maturitv from last vear
and the way it has grown, [Coach
Montgomery] is letting me do
more."
Add consistent outside shoot
ing lo Barnes's 40 inch vertical
leap, athletic moves to the basket
and ability to block plavers a foot
taller than he is. and lie can be
outright unstoppable.
"Individually, we reallv strug
gled to guard Barnes," s.iid ()re
gon State head coach Ritchie
McKay. "If Duke can't guard
him. we certainly don't have the
athletes to do it."
Barnes's bent hmates stepped
up their games as well.
Sophomore t enter ( amis Bor
chatdt, who didn't plav in Ari
zona because of an Achilles ten
don injurv, did not have an easy
return to the court. With the
Collins twins, to-Pat-10 Players
of the Week, not playing up to
their billing, Montgomery need
ed Borchardt's presence inside
early in the contest.
Bore hardt responded by play
ing strong down low and earning
three trips to the free throw line.
His four points for Stanford in
the first half were second onl\ to
Barnes's 10.
"1 feel great," Bernhardt said.
"1 didn't know how much I was
going to play. Ihe (lollins twins
struggled ajail<- bit in ijisi
half, so I think coach left fne in
there a little bit longer."
