single night.

the (lardinal.
I he (lardinal plaving without side
lined guards Irishman Susan King
and sophomore |aniie dare\ again
and had problems hanging on to the
ball, committing an astounding 30
tin novers in the contest.
I thought theit defensive con
tributed to out high number of
turuovci s. be< ause tbe\ ( ante out and
plavcd ver\ aggressive," Stanford
head co.icli I ara VanDcrvcer said.
"Oregon State plavcd verv inspired
basketball tonight."
I he heavers shot an impressive 62
pel (eni in the lii st halt to jump out to
a l.">-2 I mai k at the break.
" I be big tlefu it put us into a situa
tion where we had to plav perfect bas
ketball. said \ an I )ei Acer "We did a
great |<>b to < ut the lead to seven, but
we expended a lot of energ\ and just
got tired out tlietc.
Oregon State snapped <i I I-game
skid against the (lardinal, with their
last virion ovci Stanford dating back
to Ioo.~>.
Stanford, u hit h sits just on theedge
ol the national i ankings at No. 25, has
struggled all season on the road and
has vet to win a game away from
Maples Pavilion.
I he one bright spot for the (lardi

nal was the shooting of junior wing
I .auren St. (Hair. St. (Hair led the Pac
-10 in three-point percentage last sea
son but has struggled to consistently
find hci shot ibis year. She hit five out
of seven shots from bevond the arc this
evening, draining a game-high 21
points.
I i eslunan Nicole Powell put tip im
pressive statistic s 112 rom the point guard
position, finishing with lb points and
six assists.
However, il the (lardinal has a
praver in the tough match-up with
()rcgon at MacArtbur court it is going
to have to start playing better team
basketball.
I he loss of King and Carey early in
the earl\ season exposed a definite
weakness for the (lardinal in the
guard position. Instead of allowing
teams sikh as ()regon State who boast
smaller, <|in< kct guards exploit this
void, Stanford needs to use its extra
height to its advantage.
Senior (larolyn Moos, who stands a
loltv l')-foot-('), has vet to be incorporat
ed successful into the (lardinal at
ta< k. Alter leading Stanford in scoring
last season, Moos see ins to lack confi
dence this season, struggling to main
tain control under the basket, and
committing a sloppy 1 1 turnovers in
last nigiil'- contest
While junior forward l.indsey Ya
inasaki is playing well at the post for
the (lardinal. she is streaky and
needs some ol her teammates to step
upon nights when she can't find her
shot.
But while Stanford certainly hasn't
found the top of its game, a lot of cred
it has to go to Oregon State. The
Heavers' Ragland and Funn are ar
guabK the top conference pair on the
wing. Add (look inside and you've got
a team that could be among the lead
ers in the Pat -10 this season.
