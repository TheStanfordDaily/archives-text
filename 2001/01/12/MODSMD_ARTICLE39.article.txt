Ihe in.in himself .illirins l lns in .1 story oil his latest release, simply tilled, "Live."
A pilot, upon coming on fora landing, turns to I'anl and savs, "N'on know, a lot ol l.i
111011s people die like this." I'anl responds. "I'm not famous." Ihe pilot savs, "You
would he il we went down.
I he airplane did not go down, so I'anl, with loin studio alliums under his licit,
could come out with a two-C.I) live allium (which includes "World Ain't Slowin'
Down"). Boldly, most of the songs on this < onip.u 1 dis< .11 <• comprised ol onl\ a spare
near-acoustk trio and are often done solo, letting the melod\ and Ivriis make the
case loi Paul's talent. At one point, Paul sa\s, "We'll take a break, and then we'll form
a niosh pit and do Nil \.111.1 songs lor the rest ol the night.'' I Ins was, obviously, not
going to happen.

I )oes it woi k: Well, I'm sure
long-time Paul lans will be happ\
with it, but loi neoplntes such as
imsell, over a hundred minutes
ol I'aul does start to we.ti a bit
thin. Ihe poems and bantei
lor example, the alorementioued
airplane storv—although done
well, do not stand up to repeated
listens Paul's bravado, necessar\
to keep the albums going, makes
some ol the more precious mo
ments a bit much.
Paul's stvle is reminiscent ol
the Indigo (.iris hi his Ivrical
tin ns ,iud traditional folk sound,
even il he generalh lacks har
monic accompaniment. Both
Paul and the Indigo Cirls, inci
dentally, have excellent and
somewhat lighthearted songs
about life, with Calileo as their
total point Paul's is included on
this album.
A stand-out is Paul's "Conver
sation with a Chost," which is re
peated here as a duet with Patty
(.tiffin, A song about a lost tela

how have vou Ik-cm? Have vou
been to the races? Did you take

"Martyr's I.onnne." on the
other hand, is ,1 mixed bag; its
lively sound almost weighed
down b\ its overlv literate Ivrics.
Depending on \om mood and
polities, "Autobiography ola Pis
tol" could sound epic and insight
ful. or corniest ending and boring.
It has moments ol both greatness
and pretentiousness th.it are tvpi
cal ol the album.
Still, as capable a perlbi iner as
Paul is. his songs are not well
served by the live setting. If you
are curious to learn more about
Paul, "Live" is not the best place to
start.
"Live" is an album best appre
ciated and treasured by Paul's
fans. In the meantime, the rest ol
us should be on the lookout for
Lllis Paul's filth studio release.
