early grunge such as Nirvana and
Pearl (am. However, the ratings
system is very confusing, as are his
blurhs about each album. Neither
gives enough information about
the albums.
(Kerall, this is a good consumer
guide for those < ustomers interest

though ('.hristgau tries to (over the

It is difficult to catalog so many al
bums and his effort is praisewor
thy. but it is easier to read .1 review
online, where one (.111 find greater
depth of information.


My first name is Jesusgau.
