For centuries, healers in all
cultures have believed that
our thoughts, feelings, and
actions have a significant effect on
our health. Today, the healers'
thinking is confirmed by the
science of psychoneuroimmunol
ogy (PNI). PNI focuses on the
complex biochemical links among
the mind, the brain and the
immune system. By understand
ing these connections, we are
better able to protect our health.
We feel emotions in our bodies:
we "burn" with anger, "tremble"
with fear, and get "choked up"
with sadness. Thoughts and
emotions cause changes in the
body, and when it is attacked by
a virus or bacteria, many factors
work together to determine
whether or not we get sick.
Stress
Saying that stress causes disease
is an oversimplification. More
accurately, stress appears to
lower the body's resistance to
illness. Although everyday
stress doesn't seem to be a
health hazard, it does look like
chronic stress and major life
disruptions suppress the immune
system. It also can trigger aller
gies or a recurrence of herpes,
and can impair cardiovascular
health by raising blood pressure
and heart rate.
Mind/Body Connection
Complex pathways run between
the brain and the body's nervous,
circulatory and immune systems.
The entire body is literally "wired
by the brain. Negative emotions
can set off a complex chain of
activity that disrupts the body's
homeostasis, depletes its immune

functions, and increases blood
pressure and heart rate.
Conversely, it appears that
positive emotions can trigger a
biochemical response that
promotes heart health and
boosts the immune system.
Beneficial Traits
Our bodies have powerful
healing systems that help keep us
well. People with the following
traits often enjoy good health,
high energy, and a strong sense of
well-being. They also seem to
have fewer colds and other
immune-related illnesses, an
ability to heal faster from illness,
and enjoy increased longevity:
■ Strong social ties: Good
friendships, family relation
ships, and community
involvement
■ Spirituality: A sense of deep
meaning in life, and a connec
tion to self and others
■ Positive outlook: Hope,
optimism, a sense of humor,
and an unselfish concern for
others
■ The three C's: A sense of
personal commitment, belief
that we have control over
our lives, and a feeling of
challenge
By contrast, people who are
chronically angry and hostile
seem to be at greater risk for
heart attacks and strokes. Those
who are worried and anxious
tend to have high blood pressure,
and people suffering from
depression may have a higher
risk of coronary artery disease.
Tips That Work
There's no escaping it: good
nutrition, regular exercise, enough
sleep and stress management
keep you well and help you heal.
Balance is also key:
■ Balance your high energy
output with meditation,
visualization, and/or prayer
(they fixrus the mind, open the
heart, and slow down the
btxiy)
■ Balance the stress of daily life
by cultivating a positive
outlook; seek out and expect
positive experiences
■ Balance your concerns by
laughing at least once a day
(it brightens your mood,
lowers stress, raises your
pain threshold, and enhances
your resistance)
■ Balance your study time
with pleasurable activities
(enjoy good friends and
social occasions, good food,
sport, natural beauty, music
and art)
