Dear Q&Q: Who was it that said "Money is like
muck?" My roommate says it was Andy Warhol, I say
Andy Griffith. Please help us resolve this issue.
Signed. Mystified by Muck
Dear Mystified,
Actually the quotation is Money is like muck—not
good except to be spread." It is attributed to Francis
Bacon. An obscure fact perhaps, but I work at SFCU
so I know.

Dear Q&Q: Our organization is concerned about Lincoln's
portrait on the $5 bill. The portrait of our esteemed 16th
president shows his hair parted on the left side. It is our
belief that he parted his hair on the right.
Signed, SOPWTMTOTH (Society of People With Too Much
Time On Their Hands)
Dear SOPWTMTOTH,
The Federal Bureau of Engraving has researched this
issue carefully. They went so far as to study the death
mask of Lincoln and found that his distinctive mole and
hair part were both on his left side. Your confusion is
understandable, but I work at SFCU so I know.
