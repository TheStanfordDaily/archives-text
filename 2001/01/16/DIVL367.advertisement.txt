Dcbra Bayerd-Ramsey is the
Fairy Godmother and Manager of
the Call Center at SFCU. It's "The
Buck Stops Here" department. Dcbra
and her staff work hard to grant the
wishes of all the members who
contact the Call Center.
"When members call, we give
them our all," says Dcbra."lt is for
the member we care. Our knowl
edge and skills we gladly share."
The Call Center staff is available
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday
through Friday. Our reporter, posing
as a member, found the Call Center
staff to be all they had promised.
They were friendly, knowledgeable
and stayed with the problem until it
had been resolved.The only disap
pointment reported was that the
staff did not consistently talk in
rhyme. In their defense however, it is
not easy to find rhymes for Home
Equity," "accrual," or "deductibility."
If you have questions you'd like
to address to a real live person (or if
you think of a good rhyme for
"equity") call Dcbra, the Fairy God
mother of Finance, or her staff at
