Stanford Sierra Camp is a camp run by Stanford students, nestled on the shore of Fallen Leaf
Lake at the south end of Lake Tahoe. In the beautiful Sierra Nevada Mountains right on the
edge of Desolation Wilderness, 60 energetic, creative, responsible Stanford students work to
make sure that the 730 Stanford Alumni Families who come to vacation over the course of the
summer, have an awesome time. For thirteen weeks, it is the students that make SSC such an
amazing place. From working with kids and teaching waterskiing, to helping in the kitchen and
making beds, the student staff do it all. A summer at Stanford Sierra Camp entails hard work,
hard play, unrivaled friendship and camaraderie. We're looking for Kid's Group Counselors, Art
Instructors, Boatdock Masters, Craft Teachers, Dance Instructors, Dining Room hosts,
Milkshake Blendors, Hiking Leaders, Kitchen Gurus, Music Directors, Naturalists, Office Gods,
Alumni Lovers, Rock Climbers, Photographers, Sailors, Tennis Teachers, Waterski Aficionados,
Volleyball Spikers, and more!
The combination of people, location, and atmosphere is unparalleled to any other experience
you could possibly imagine. Stanford Sierra Camp is a job, a community, and an experience you
will never forget. What a great way to spend your summer!
APPLICATIONS DUE JANUARY 22
available at Bowman Alumni House or at http://ssc.stanford.edu
