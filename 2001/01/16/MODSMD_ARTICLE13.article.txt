### 
SANTA TKCLA, El Salvador (AP) — With
iht' ground settling and time passing, rescuers
said yesterday that the chance of finding sur
vivors from ,m earthquake that killed more
than 500 people is slipping — though one man
was freed after using his cell phone to call tor
help.
Hundreds of people remained buried be
neath .1 mountain of rock and earth in the Las
C.olinas neighborhood here, some three miles
west of the capital.
Residents complained that the government
allowed land owners over the vears to clear
trees from the hillside, alleging that the lack of
ground cover could leave those below vulnera
ble lo landslides.
Saturday's magnitude-7.6 quake loosened
that hillside, burying the middle-class neigh
boi hood at its base and bringing down some of
the mansions above.
Although the largest number of deaths ap

peared to be in Las C.olinas, the quake caused
landslides across LI Salvador, burving coflee
workers and blocking roads. Numbers from of
ficial sources varied wildly.
With nearly 5,000 houses destroyed and
tens of thousands more damaged in LI Sal
vador, many people were living with relatives
or in shelters.
()thers who still had homes lacked basic ser
vices. Water service was cut to as many as half of
the country's 0 million people, the Pan-Anieri
can I lealth ()rgani/ation said.
Arnn Maj. Jose Miranda said there was little
i hance more survivors would be found, adding
that the majority of those under the rubble who
weren't killed instantly likely had already suflo
cated.
"Nonetheless, at 4 a.m. they pulled out a
body that still had warm blood on it. so any
thing is possible," he said.
katliia Machaca has lost all hope that her

parents and two oldest daughters will be found
alive. Rescuers found the body of one of her
children, 5-year-old katliia. But she has no in
formation on the others.
Pulling a child's sin k from the mud, she said:
"I'm finding everything from the house except
the most important things."
She has stayed at the sp«>t w here her parents'
house used to Ik* since the quake, and she
vowed not to leave.
1 won't move from here until they find the
bodies," she said, weeping.
I lei daughter, who had been riding her bi
cycle when the earthquake struck, yvas found
hugging a boy.
"Maybe she yvas afraid," Machaca said.
She was afraid to see hei husband, an elec
trician in Los Angeles who was scheduled to ar
rive on Monday.
"1 don't knoyv what I'll tell him," she said.
"This is hard."
