instead ol lising the high lile in Siliion Vallev.

Among the ranks of those who could not cut it
are a number of students, including some from
Stanford.
Stanford students, though, are lucky
enough to enjoy .1 liberal leave polity at the

even \cais, to pursue any notion tli.it strikes

110 wondei mam students took advantage of
the policy to tr\ then hand at e-business ven
tures and start-ups.
Lxperts estimate that only three out of
ever\ 10 start-ups will be financially success
ful. I hat's a 70 percent chance that your
great dot-coin idea might not only lail to
make millions, but also struggle to remain
s( >lvcnt.

Liking time oil is a big decision, one that
should he < hosen with milt h < ontcmplation
and < all ied out with courage.
Returning students should take solace 111
the dreams they came to Stanford to pursue.
During no other time in your life will you
have die opportunity to explore the plethora
of acadcmii and extracurricular options
available to you at Stanford. Instead of < bas
ing million-dollar dreams, take pleasure in
the ones that you have been nurturing for
years.
While Silicon Valle\ is a tantali/iug reason

t<> come to Stanford, chances arc that most
students conic here to learn and grow in the
I Diversity's unique acadcmii environment,
not to |> I.i\ "Who Wants lb he A Mega-Mil

We wel( oine dot-com veterans hack to the
farm. Share your experiences in the real
world with your fellow students and take ad
vantage of your remaining time here.
And for all you fu//.ies who are gleefully
helping vour former dot-(om p.ils move hack
