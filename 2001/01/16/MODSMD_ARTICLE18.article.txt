### JEFF LOWENSTEIN GUEST COLUMNIST 
I tii st heard Mai tin I.uthci King when I
was seven. M\ teacher, Ms. Connollv,
placed the needle delicateh on the record
player, and Ins soaring baritone, whit h
prcK I.inned Ins dream ili.it one d.i\ the sons ot
lorniei slaves and the sons of former slaveown
ers would sit togethei at the table of brother
hood, filled our classroom.
i stopped fidget inland sat, transfixed In Ins
voice, In the audience's response and l>\ the
potency of his message. Dr. King seemed .1
modern Moses, singlc-handcdlv leading
African-Americans to greater rights, and we
white Americans to loftier levels of moral
awareness, the peak of which oct lined 011 the
Mall in Washington 111 HKW.
Mv opinion of Dr. King rested unchanged
until my senior year at Stanford I niversity, when
I chose him as my thesis topic. In main ways, he
liecame an even more elevated figure, lbs deci
sion to seek counseling services for l/ola Currv
after she stabbed him with a letter openei .it a
1957 book signing struck me .is the ultimate ap
plication of his non-violent philosophy.
I saw how he had the intellectual fortitude and
raw courage to incorporate the setbacks he expe
rienced into .1 steady expansion of Ins vision.
King moved from .1 tacit acceptance of seg
regation at the beginnings of the Montgomery
litis Boycott 111 1953 to calling for the institu
tion's abolition. He went from complit itious si
lence on the Vietnam War 111 to a
forthright denunciation of it m I9ti7. And he
evolved from talking about the evils of segrega
tion to addressing issues of ( lass 111 America 111
IWH. At the time of his murder, King was

prep.it ing .1 multi-rat i.tl, nationwide Poor Peo
ple's Mart h on \\ ashington.
M\ studies also afforded a deepei appreciation
of the myriad pressures he contended \mlll daily.
I heseobst.u lest .line from outside the movement
— constant death tlne.its, J. Ktlgai Hoover and
the FBl's efforts to destrov him, northern and
southern white resistance, opposition from the
federal govei nnient — as well .is from within it.
Malcolm \ derided King s non-violent phi
losophv and his goal of integration, while Stu
dent Non-Violent (loot diluting Committee
metnbeis held .1 more grass-roots vision of
change and wearied t»f non-violence as the
19(>0s progressetl. Kind's persistence 111 the
face of these challenges serves both as testa
ment to Ins religious faith, tii nilv mooi ed 111 the
Afro-( christian t hurt h. and as evidence of Ins
remarkable t harat ter.
He bet anie more human to me. too. Be
cause Stanford housed the King Papers Pro
ject. I had access to almost everything he evei
wrote. I read Ins hantlwi itten autobiographical
essav, penned at age 15, and was gratified to
discover that he was a pool spellei. I lis vnlnei -
ability —when he heard of John Kenneth's as
sassination. he told Ins wife Corel t a that he
would be murdered In age 40 — reminded me
tfi.it this was a mail, not a saint.
()ther, less flattering realizations confirmed
that assessment. I learned about Ins marital in
fidelities and the sexism that pervaded the
Southern Christian Leadership ('.(inference. 1
found out «ilh>nt Ins plagiarism 011 his Boston
I■ niversity dissertation. His failure to respond
bravely to Adam Clayton Powell's HMiO threat
of leaking a fictitious homosexual .iff.lll be
tween Rustinand King also disappointed me.
Although reflet ting 011 the range of Dr. Kind's

choices pushed me toward .1 more complex and
balanced appraisal of his life, I still conceived of
him primarily as an historic figure, whose strug
gles had little direct connection to me.
Now I am 35, the same age that Dr. King was
when he received the Nobel I'l i/.e in I9fi4. I sec-
King .is a tall tree in a forest of civil rights free
dom fighters such as Ilia Baker, Fanny Lou
Hamer, Robert F. Williams and Rosa Parks. 1
have .ilso understood the wavs that different
communities around the world have heard Dr.
King's call and emulated lus tactics.
As a new husband and an adoptive fathei of
an eight-year-old !>ov. I appreciate the difticul
t\ King experienced in balancing public and
lamilv commitments. I also derive inspiration
from his bouts with self doubt and despair — in
I.•()(). he told a ( luc ago audience, "Sometimes
I feel discouraged, and feel m\ life's in vain'' —
and from the measure of victory he had gained
m those battles at the time of bis death.
Dr. King s life guides me as 1 attempt to pro
vide ni\ son Aidan with a model of someone
striving for soc lal justic rand equip him with the
essential tools —,1 sense of history, (lear and in
dependent thinking, a respect for the power of
words and considered moral adion — that he
needs for Ins own encounters with rac ism, ho
mophobia and the many other impediments
that still block the realization of Dr. Kings
Moved community. And on Jan. lii.theriavhe
would have turned years old. I spoke about
Dr. King to Aidan's c lass, taught bv another
Mrs. Connolly .
