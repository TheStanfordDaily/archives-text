I w as in Houston \ish m\ parents a
tew weeks ago when Rod Paige, the
superintendent <>l the Houston Inde

ucation secretary.
Editorials and news articles in the
Houston (Ihronicle generally praised
Paige s tenure as head of one of the l.irgcst

My sister's comments over the last
four years about some of the dismal
teachers in her sclu >< >1 made me w<>nder
about the media's endorsements. I here
was a physics teachei who had never
taken a single physics course and
l-reiuh students barel) able to utter
"bonjour," but making As. And these

were the advanced classes from one of
the top high schools in the disii u i!
Students m publu m hoolsare not being ad
e<|tiatel\ prepared toi serious professional ca
reers. largely due to teachei s w bo do not knov\
their subject matters. Ibis ignorance is most
pronounced in the sciences and math. Ibis
st.iteof affairs persists in ,i svstein geared more
toward protecting abysmal tea<beis than pro
moting students' educations.
Furthermore, while columnists and
politicians are constant!) pinpointing ed

Sowh.it can be done about our s< hoc >ls?

Sowh.it can be done about our s< hoc >ls?
Have graduate students teach. I believe
that ibis is a strong proposal toi several

materiality means that t elativeh sin.ill finan

means that you alread\ have .t self-selected

And. most important, knowledge. I he
