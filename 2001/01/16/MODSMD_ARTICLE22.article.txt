## Collins, Jacobsen dump Ducks Inside-outside combo too much for Oregon to handle as Stanford improves to 15-0 
### TIM KANE EDITORIAL STAFF 
As Stanford basketball games go, Sat
urday's battle with Oregon was the
equivalent of the movie that everyone in
the lamilv actually enjoys.
Foi fans of the inside game, there was
aclinic b\ [ ison Collins— to the tune of
24 points and 12 rebounds.
For those intrigued In long-range
bombing. ( asev Jacobsen kept effortless
ly dropping in as lie retreated
farther and farther behind the arc —
enough for 4-of-5 shooting and 20
points.
And for those backers of the No. 1
Cardinal (15-0. 4-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) still recovering from Thursday's
horror show against Oregon State, the
best ending possible — an entertaining,
engrossing and dominant 100-70 win
over the Ducks (10-3, 1-2).
Following the game. Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery was quick to
praise the plav of Collins, who lias been
on a tear since the win ovei Duke back in
December.
"Jason was huge," said Montgomery.
"He missed a couple finishes early and 1
think he got angry, and just started to
dominate inside the paint. [He] probably
had his best effort so far numbers-wise."
Satruday's matchup struck a contrast
with the slowball snore-test against the
Beavers two davs earlier. The Ducks

were aggressive from the get-go. pushing
the ball to star forward Brvan Bracey and
letting him create his own shot from the
outside right away, rather than milking
the clock like ()regon State did.
But inside, there was no question
about who was boss. I he Due ks' center,
|ulius Hicks, stood a mere 0-foot-8, al
lowing Collins to have his wav in the post
foi much of the afternoon. I lie juniot
center already had 24 points, a career
high, before Montgoiuen took him out
with more than 12 minutes left in the
game.
As dominating as Collins was on the
inside. Jacobsen was almost his equal
from the outside. Most playei s tossing up
shots from three or four feet behind the
3-point line would chaw groans from
their coach, but as |acobsen is showing
evervdav. he isn't like most plavers.
"Shooting range? 1 don't put a limit
on it," Jacobsen said, "ft gets farther
everv year, and that's the plan.'
F.ven though there was much fbi
him to like (between Collins's and Ja
cobsen's heroics), what pleased Mont
gomery most was the performance of
his bench. Redshirt freshman Justin
Davis had the best game of his young
career, rendering Brace\ a non-fac tor
the rest of the game on the offensive
end. I he power forward added 10 re
bounds and seven points to lus defen
sive effort, along with a monstei clunk
off a Jason Collins pass and a twisting
ovcr-the-shoulder layup.
"He got the rebounds he should
have," said Montgomery. "He defend
ed very well, got after the ball a couple
times with his quickness. I expect him
to relax and get a better and better. It's

jusi .1 matter of understanding what is .1
good pla\ tor hint, and what fist' lie 1.111

"1 don't think the issue is whether or

if somebody can come in and plav with

"We have been making those plavs,

Senior (jaard Mil- McDonald had another efficient qame at the point for Stanford — five points,
sevt n assists in-1 the result was another Cardinal victory, upping the team's record to 15-0.
As Stanford basketball games go, Sat
urday's battle with Oregon was the
equivalent of the movie that everyone in
the lamilv actually enjoys.
Foi fans of the inside game, there was
aclinic b\ [ ison Collins— to the tune of
24 points and 12 rebounds.
For those intrigued In long-range
bombing. ( asev Jacobsen kept effortless
ly dropping in as lie retreated
farther and farther behind the arc —
enough for 4-of-5 shooting and 20
points.
And for those backers of the No. 1
Cardinal (15-0. 4-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) still recovering from Thursday's
horror show against Oregon State, the
best ending possible — an entertaining,
engrossing and dominant 100-70 win
over the Ducks (10-3, 1-2).
Following the game. Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery was quick to
praise the plav of Collins, who lias been
on a tear since the win ovei Duke back in
December.
"Jason was huge," said Montgomery.
"He missed a couple finishes early and 1
think he got angry, and just started to
dominate inside the paint. [He] probably
had his best effort so far numbers-wise."
Satruday's matchup struck a contrast
with the slowball snore-test against the
Beavers two davs earlier. The Ducks

were aggressive from the get-go. pushing
the ball to star forward Brvan Bracey and
letting him create his own shot from the
outside right away, rather than milking
the clock like ()regon State did.
But inside, there was no question
about who was boss. I he Due ks' center,
|ulius Hicks, stood a mere 0-foot-8, al
lowing Collins to have his wav in the post
foi much of the afternoon. I lie juniot
center already had 24 points, a career
high, before Montgoiuen took him out
with more than 12 minutes left in the
game.
As dominating as Collins was on the
inside. Jacobsen was almost his equal
from the outside. Most playei s tossing up
shots from three or four feet behind the
3-point line would chaw groans from
their coach, but as |acobsen is showing
evervdav. he isn't like most plavers.
"Shooting range? 1 don't put a limit
on it," Jacobsen said, "ft gets farther
everv year, and that's the plan.'
F.ven though there was much fbi
him to like (between Collins's and Ja
cobsen's heroics), what pleased Mont
gomery most was the performance of
his bench. Redshirt freshman Justin
Davis had the best game of his young
career, rendering Brace\ a non-fac tor
the rest of the game on the offensive
end. I he power forward added 10 re
bounds and seven points to lus defen
sive effort, along with a monstei clunk
off a Jason Collins pass and a twisting
ovcr-the-shoulder layup.
"He got the rebounds he should
have," said Montgomery. "He defend
ed very well, got after the ball a couple
times with his quickness. I expect him
to relax and get a better and better. It's

jusi .1 matter of understanding what is .1
good pla\ tor hint, and what fist' lie 1.111
do."
Davis's excellent defensive job 011

dersized .power forward who can shoot

Among the others turning in im
pressive portormeis was junior point

characteristicallv aggressive in driving
to the basket in the second half, and
sophomore centei Curtis Borchardt,
who c ontributed II points and four re
bounds.
