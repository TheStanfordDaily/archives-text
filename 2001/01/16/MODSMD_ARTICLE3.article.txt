is more intricate than some be

Hoover's fast Asian collection
will be the first to move. I hat col

Hoover Library; which was
founded in 1919 bv tlien-l tiiver
sity President Herbert Hoover,
supports research in the- field of
international affairs since the be
ginning of the 20th centur). and
in the political, economic and so
cial history of several areas of the
modern world. It contains more
than I million items, including
books, pamphlets and govern
ment documents. I lie Hoovei

Institution Archives, which in
clude material such as unpub
lished diaries, memoirs of public
figures and original correspon
dence, would noi be relocated
under the proposal.
"I loover was very, verv idealis
tic when he founded this place,"
said one staff member who
wished not to be named, "lie
wanted anvone and everyone to
be able to come in and stuck the
causes of war, hoping th.it anoth
er war could be avoided. He also
wanted it to be separate from
Stanford."
News <>1 the proposal con
firmed Illinois that had been cir
culating among libi ar\ stippoi let s
for several years. I he\ have been
concerned foi the future of the li
brar\ since funding from I niver
sit\ 1 .ibr.u ic s began to dec line.
Funding from the I nivei sit\ ac -
counts fbi two-thirds of the operat
ing budget for I loovei s libran
and archives. \ccording to sources
at Hoover, the I m\eisit\ plans to
ieduce funding still tin the r.
frustrated si.iff members com
plain that the Hoover Institution
lias been \ ei \ sun essf ul in raising
funds but, in the words ol one
employee, "there are no plans to
make up the difference in out
budget."
Ktc heinench denied that the

proposal has anything to do with
budget savings. In his letter, he
noted that he is currently consid
ering plans to increase the bud
gel lot both the archival and gen
eral collection .it Hoover.
I le did mention, however, that
it tlu* current proposal is ap
proved, the budget for the gener
al library collection at 11 novel will
move to the University's main li
brary budget.
1 here are also concerns
among the stall of both Green
and Hoover libraries about
wbethel (ireen is equipped to
take over the collection duties
needed to keep tlie Hoover col
lection alive. According to
stall members, the two libraries
dillci in both mission and ap
proach. While the Green collec
tion-development staff responds
to f.u nit \ requests and orders
material to support Stanford's
academic curriculum. Hoover
works to collet t diflicult-to-obtain
books relating to the contempo
rar\ politic al scene. Doing this re
quires c urators to establish spe
cial contacts worldwide and to
follow "non-standard methods of
acquisition."
"Who would do it?" asked one
Hoovet stall member familial
with (lie situation. "Il thec urators
who arc c urrentlv in (ireen doing

acquisitions are asked to take on
these extra duties, we don't see
how they can do it. They're not
trained to do it, and they also
don't have the connections to do
it. Hoover's collecting has always
been more specialized."
Keller rejected this argument.
In the document prepared by his
office, he contended that the Uni
versity library system will be able
to maintain the same level of ex
pertise for collecting that has ex
isted in Hoover. He added that
each collecting area will have
enough support staff to ensure
tli.it collecting and cataloging w ill
proceed as efficiently as possible.
Supporters of the new plan
also argued that housing the
Hoover material at Green will
make the resources more accessi
ble. In his letter to concerned pa
trons of Hoover Library,
Ktchemendy wrote, "[users] will
in fact have increased access to
the general material, since
Green's hours of operation are
considerably longer than
1 loover's, and will also be allowed
to browse and use anv other ma
terial in the (ireen stacks."
labrarv stall and those that use
the library worry that Hoover's
tradition of being a free public li
brary may be at risk. They are
skeptical that (ireen would be

willing to give up its usage lees ll
Hoover's collection is transferred
there. Currently, users without a
Stanford affiliation are allowed
seven free visits to Green per
year. After that, they are c barged
five dollars per visit.
Hoover Institute Deputv Di
rector Charles Palm oversees the
institute's library and arc hive. 1 It
said that the issue of usage tees
has been addressed.
"That was one of my concerns
during discussions with Stanford
University Libraries," he said.
"But it's been worked out in a wav
that's satisfactory."
According to Palm, scholars w ho
register to use Hoover's collection
will be issued a card that grants
them free access to (ireen as well as
other University collections.
The plan's opponents also ar
gued that the proposed move
would betray the donors of mut li
of the material contained in the
collection. In a message posted to
several newsgroups, supporters
wrote, "we have been collecting
and accepting donations over the
years . . . with the understanding
that these materials would be
open to all visitors in perpetuity."
Ktchemendy's letter also
sought to reassure library users
that the plan is not set in stone.
"This is still just a proposed so

lution ili.it we .tit* currently con
sidering," lit- wrote. "Before
making .1 final decision, 1 will Ik*
consulting our local faculty ... to
make sure tins is the best avail
able option."

1 here are also concerns
among the stall of both Green
and Hoover libraries about
wbethel (ireen is equipped to
take over the collection duties
needed to keep tlie Hoover col
lection alive. According to
stall members, the two libraries
dillci in both mission and ap
proach. While the Green collec
tion-development staff responds
to f.u nit \ requests and orders
material to support Stanford's
academic curriculum. Hoover
works to collet t diflicult-to-obtain
books relating to the contempo

quires c urators to establish spe
cial contacts worldwide and to
follow "non-standard methods of
acquisition."
"Who would do it?" asked one
Hoovet stall member familial
with (lie situation. "Il thec urators
who arc c urrentlv in (ireen doing

acquisitions are asked to take on
these extra duties, we don't see
how they can do it. They're not
trained to do it, and they also
don't have the connections to do
it. Hoover's collecting has always
been more specialized."
Keller rejected this argument.
In the document prepared by his
office, he contended that the Uni
versity library system will be able
to maintain the same level of ex
pertise for collecting that has ex
isted in Hoover. He added that
each collecting area will have
enough support staff to ensure
tli.it collecting and cataloging w ill
proceed as efficiently as possible.
Supporters of the new plan
also argued that housing the
Hoover material at Green will
make the resources more accessi
ble. In his letter to concerned pa
trons of Hoover Library,
Ktchemendy wrote, "[users] will
in fact have increased access to
the general material, since
Green's hours of operation are
considerably longer than
1 loover's, and will also be allowed
to browse and use anv other ma
terial in the (ireen stacks."
labrarv stall and those that use
the library worry that Hoover's
tradition of being a free public li
brary may be at risk. They are
skeptical that (ireen would be

willing to give up its usage lees ll
Hoover's collection is transferred
there. Currently, users without a
Stanford affiliation are allowed
seven free visits to Green per
year. After that, they are c barged
five dollars per visit.

said that the issue of usage tees
has been addressed.
"That was one of my concerns
during discussions with Stanford

"But it's been worked out in a wav
that's satisfactory."
According to Palm, scholars w ho
register to use Hoover's collection
will be issued a card that grants
them free access to (ireen as well as
other University collections.
The plan's opponents also ar
gued that the proposed move
would betray the donors of mut li
of the material contained in the
collection. In a message posted to
several newsgroups, supporters
wrote, "we have been collecting
and accepting donations over the

that these materials would be
open to all visitors in perpetuity."
Ktchemendy's letter also
sought to reassure library users
that the plan is not set in stone.

1 here are also concerns
among the stall of both Green
and Hoover libraries about
wbethel (ireen is equipped to
take over the collection duties
needed to keep tlie Hoover col
lection alive. According to
stall members, the two libraries
dillci in both mission and ap
proach. While the Green collec
tion-development staff responds
to f.u nit \ requests and orders
material to support Stanford's
academic curriculum. Hoover
works to collet t diflicult-to-obtain
books relating to the contempo
rar\ politic al scene. Doing this re
quires c urators to establish spe
cial contacts worldwide and to
follow "non-standard methods of
acquisition."
"Who would do it?" asked one
Hoovet stall member familial
with (lie situation. "Il thec urators
who arc c urrentlv in (ireen doing

acquisitions are asked to take on
these extra duties, we don't see
how they can do it. They're not
trained to do it, and they also
don't have the connections to do
it. Hoover's collecting has always
been more specialized."
Keller rejected this argument.
In the document prepared by his
office, he contended that the Uni
versity library system will be able
to maintain the same level of ex
pertise for collecting that has ex
isted in Hoover. He added that
each collecting area will have
enough support staff to ensure
tli.it collecting and cataloging w ill
proceed as efficiently as possible.
Supporters of the new plan
also argued that housing the
Hoover material at Green will
make the resources more accessi
ble. In his letter to concerned pa
trons of Hoover Library,
Ktchemendy wrote, "[users] will
in fact have increased access to
the general material, since
Green's hours of operation are
considerably longer than
1 loover's, and will also be allowed
to browse and use anv other ma
terial in the (ireen stacks."
labrarv stall and those that use
the library worry that Hoover's
tradition of being a free public li
brary may be at risk. They are
skeptical that (ireen would be

willing to give up its usage lees ll
Hoover's collection is transferred
there. Currently, users without a
Stanford affiliation are allowed
seven free visits to Green per
year. After that, they are c barged
five dollars per visit.
Hoover Institute Deputv Di
rector Charles Palm oversees the
institute's library and arc hive. 1 It
said that the issue of usage tees
has been addressed.
"That was one of my concerns
during discussions with Stanford
University Libraries," he said.
"But it's been worked out in a wav
that's satisfactory."
According to Palm, scholars w ho
register to use Hoover's collection
will be issued a card that grants
them free access to (ireen as well as
other University collections.
The plan's opponents also ar
gued that the proposed move
would betray the donors of mut li
of the material contained in the
collection. In a message posted to
several newsgroups, supporters
wrote, "we have been collecting
and accepting donations over the
years . . . with the understanding
that these materials would be
open to all visitors in perpetuity."
Ktchemendy's letter also
sought to reassure library users
that the plan is not set in stone.
"This is still just a proposed so

lution ili.it we .tit* currently con
sidering," lit- wrote. "Before
making .1 final decision, 1 will Ik*
consulting our local faculty ... to
make sure tins is the best avail
able option."
Etchemeiuh selected Nancy
kollmann, director ot Stanford's
('.enter for Russian and Kastern
European Studies, to bead a re
view committee to advise bim on
the opinions ot the Stanford tac
ulty regarding the proposed
plan.
fbe t.isk force will speak to
representatives from several de
partments, including African
Studies, Russian and East Euro
pean Studies «uul Middle East
Studies. Tliev .ilso plan to inter
view .it least one stalf member
from Hoover, fhe committee has
alread\ met once and has plans to
meet with Keller and Palm. I he
committee's report should be
readv by the end ot the month.
kollmann said the committee
will not be speaking with re
searchers outside of Stanford
who use the Hoover facility, but
tliev have been supplied with
nianv letters from concerned li
brary users.
" i he kev issue here is main
taining the world-class quality of
the Hoover library," said
Kollmann.
