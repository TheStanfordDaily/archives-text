Every business school in the world
claims to promote "entrepreneurship"
— a monster of a word barely known
outside the business school dictionary.
Defining the term itself is hard
enough; even more difficult is decid
ing just how it should be taught.
At the heart of the debate is
whether at one extreme, entrepreneur
ship should be taught by 27-year-old
dotcom millionaires — in business
school jargon, "the living case study
approach ' —- or at the other, whether
it should be based on esoteric research
— the academic approach. One school
that is ideally placed to embrace both
is Stanford.
