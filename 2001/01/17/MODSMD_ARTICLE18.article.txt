Hewlett's accomplishments as an engi
neer should make him a role model for any
aspiring inventor. I lis accomplishments as
I lie co-founder, president and CEO of
Hewlett-Packard should make him a role
model for the business community. But his
undying respect and compassion for the
people around him, the people who helped
him succeed and the local, national and
global community' of which he was a part
should serve as an example for all human
beings.
