Amid .ill t lie adieus in cniK hid to

about tlit* enduing support tlit*
President reteived from one particiil.u
sliee of the demographic pie college
students.
In the ItMMi election, ( linton bettered
Ins Republic an opponent, Scnatot Rohci t
Dole, In uearh '20 points among voters
aged IS to '21.
I o those who attribute this hit ol
eratic>nal trivia to ( Inn(lull's die tinn tli.it

anyone mulct 111i11 \
who's not a liberal
doesn't have .1 heart,
it's worthwhile to note
that voting votet s pre
ferred Vice President
(.ore to Hush l>\ .1 mar
gill ol only two points.
Moreover, in the

wald mo\ us. s( oring < out lot table vu toi ics
with voters aged IS to '21 111 the 1 *><S-1 and
198S presidential <011 tests.
In short, ( '.linton's wa\ with voting
voters was the exception ratlict than
norm lot Democratic presidential (an
didates, post-Vietnam. \nd ('.linton w.is
nothing tl not exceptional, lie jogged,
he wore shades and plavcd the s.i\, he
had movie stai s sleep ovet bis pad, and
they paid him.
l o(jitote scnioi Hr\an Hughes, .1 tank
ing Stanford Demon at. "('.linton nevet
had a problem looking 01 a< ting cool."
Kven the st and.il that nearlv < ost the
president his job his.ilfaii with a White
House intern and subsequent tcstimom
concerning the details thereof—was
shrugged oil l>\ voting Americans as
though il hadn't happened in the first
place.
Author I out Wolfe observed. "()ldct
Americans tended to be sho< ked, but ji 1-
nior-high-s( 11001. high-sc Itool. and (ollcge
students understood (ompleteh what
[Clinton| was saving and wondered what
.ill the litss was about, lite two of tltein had
merelv been hooking tip."
Arsenio 11 all appcaratic c sand \l I \ 111-
terviews aside. President ('.linton's appeal
to the universitN set is based on more than
appearance.
I he departing president is a one-man
embodiment ol the twin revolutions out
generation (\ or Y) has inherited — the
Sexual Revolution ol the late 'tins. and the
Reagan revolution of the cat l\ 'NOs.
Whereas posl-'()Os liberals offered

voters the hints ol the liist revolution
(ahoriion-on-deinand, no-iault divorce
and saine-sex m.linage) and post Rca
g.m eonsei \ atives pushed the products
ol the second revolution (tax mis, free
trade and hecfict defense budgets),
Clinton (oinhined (lie two revolutions,
an -brushing then excesses, into a no
lose (oalition.
In doing so. ( Inn on sold the count r\ .1
politic al pac kagc that rang soc leai l\ in the
cals of ve >ung adults bee a use it was exact l\
what so main ol them wanted the free
dom 10 make as mile h inonc\ as possible
during the week, and the trccclom to be
lelt alone 011 the weekends.
President ( linton introduced (ios lib
eralism to SOs ambition. The result is a
countr\ that seems to have mixed up .ill its
s\ nibols. Rock songs once pl.ived at
Wc todsiot k are now emploxed to acker tise
mini-vans and soli <li inks. I* rstw hile Heat
poets Man (iinsberg and |ac k Kerouac
liaxe been reincarnated to market (lap
khakis and Apple computers.
Some might find it ironic that .«t the end
of his second term in offie e, the first Dcino
c ratic president since M)R to win re-elec
lion might pardon Michael Milken, the
junk-hond corporate raidct that once per
se milled SOs Republic an greed.
E.us from now some social historian
wit It a good sense of In unot will sii down to
write .1 thesis on the late 00s ,uid come to
the hold conclusion tli.it the student
protestet s we t cut at all radical. but 1 .it bet
conservative, lor all then promises of
vouthlul creativit\ and expression, the
protesters marched fot the most hat k
nevctl and time-tested of demands— sex
and pills.
MereK .1 generation later, it's tliffitnit
to differentiate the voices of the Herkcle\
raclic al w ho in the simuuei of 'bS shouted
that the I nited States government was
"evil, lac Ist and imperialistic." and Presi
dent Reagan, who in his liist inauguration
speech remarked that Americans had
been told too often the govet mucin is the
solution, when, in fact, the government is
the problem.
Having entwined one revolution with
another. President ( linton validated both
and staked his own plat e in historv.
H\ convinc ing the youngest voters that
he had indeed offered tliem the best of
both words, ('.linton ensured that 11 is po
litic al legacy would not soon end.
I hat is. not until the next revolution.
