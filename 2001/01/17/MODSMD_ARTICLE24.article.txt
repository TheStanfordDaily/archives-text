Senior Ankur Shah is working on Ins hon
ors thesis involving French thinker Ruoul
Vaneigem's book "The Revolution of Every
day Life," which Shah says addresses "how to
break out of the oppression and alienation of
life through a reinvestment of possibility into
everyday life."
Shah's thesis explores the question "What
is subversive about love?"
Shah's interest in Vaneigem means that
he's a French literature major, right?
Wrong. Shah plans to graduate this year
with a degree in mathematical and computa
tional science.
Although he is a "tec hie," Shah can write a
"fuzzy" thesis through the Humanities Hon
ors Program, an interdepartmental honors
program offered through the Interdiscipli
nary Studies in the Humanities Department.
"The beauty of the Humanities Honors
Program is that it doesn't relate [to mv
major]," he said.
Besides the thesis. Shall c ites sever.il other
benefits of the program.
"I've met a slew of helpful professors,
found an advisor who happens to be a spe
cialist in my thesis topic and received a lot of
support in what can be a prettv long under

taking," he said.
The program was created in 1947 b\ then-
English Prof, and Dean of Humanities |ohn
W. Dodds.
According to Lawrence Ryan, professor
emeritus of English and humanities, Dodds
was one of many faculty members who felt
th.it "students needed something outside of
their departmental major.
Rvan added that "il is one of the oldest
honors programs on campus."
The program differs from other depart
mental honors programs because n is inter
disciplinarv, has a required core and its par
ticipants do not have to major in the humani
ties.
Senior Holland Smith is another partici
pant in the program.
He is also one of two students on the pro
gram's steering committee. Smith's duties iti
clude reading thesis proposals bv students
wishing to join the program.
"1 chose the Humanities Honors Program
because 1 wanted to expand the scope of mv
honors thesis," said Smith, a Slavic Lan
guages and Literature major. "1 like the in
terdisciplinary approach to academics that
the program offers, and it has helped me use
a wider variety of sources on mv thesis that I
wouldn't have considered otherwise."
I he program consists of a sophomore core

colloquium and three seminars usualh taken
din ing the junior year. It culminates in a se
nior honors essa\.
Most participants appl\ to ihe- program
during their sophomore vears before dec l.n -
ing then majors.
"Since the progtam is open to students in
anv major, tliev don't need to know what their
major is — onlv that 11it*\ are interested in (on
tinning their studx ot the humanities." said
program administratoi Monica Moore. "De
claring in the sophomore veat allows the most
tlexihilitv lot completing the requirements."
Program director Paul Robinson teaches
the sophomore core colloquium with Knglish
Prof. I lelen Brooks. For the List two veai s. the
i lass lias lot used on Shakespeare's "11.unlet
and explored different interpretations of the
storv b\ viewers and critics.
"Its purpose is to introduce students to the
idea of interpretation and to expose them to a
number of particulai interpretive strategies
or traditions," Robinson said, "(hit idea is
that students need to build up a reperton ol
interpretive strategies with which to ap
proac li tlicit i liosen honors essa\ topic.
"Most students who niajoi 111 the program
want to pursue an interdisciplinat \ < oin sr i»|

the established majors," Robinson added. Ii
is something of a self-designed niajoi
