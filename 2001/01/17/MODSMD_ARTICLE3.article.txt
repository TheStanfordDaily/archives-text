Attendance has been steadih
increasing. When Poweissaw ih.it

ed to take the ( lasses tli.in there
were spaces available, he decided
to make a sign-up the dav betore,
which would operate on a first
coine, first-served basis.
" I guess one thing led to anoth
er. with e.u li (juartei seeing longei
lines, and eventualk people who
showed upat 9a.m. toi 9 a.m. sign
ups did not get in to the class."
Powers explained. " I he longest
line began at 7:30 the night betore,
with tents and sleeping bags on the
steps. Anvone who showed up
after 1:30 a.m. did not get in."
Such demand convinced Pow
ers to ci eate new (lasses.
"It was when the sprinklers
went oil on a ( old night that we de
cided we needed anotliei solution,
so I added a third davtime (lass
and anotliei evening (lass," Pow
ers said.

accommodate more students at

ex( eptional contributions to edu

However, Powers's distin

to the program.
"He brings Ins knowledge and
