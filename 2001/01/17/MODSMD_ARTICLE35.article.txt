l'()R I LAND. ()re. (Al') — Rushing sc 1-

seart hers have created the world's fiist ge

researchers who treated WDi — foi "in

goal is not to tinker with the human blue
print but to use monkevs in the lalxiratoi \ to
advance medical researi hand wipe out dis

I he resean hers hope to introdiueothei
genes in rhesus monkevs that could triggei
diseases like Alzheimer's, diabetes, breast
cancer or 111V

experiments aimed .it bloc king diseases at
the genetic level.
"I think we're at an extraordinary 1 mo
ment in the history of humans," said Dr.
