One man's dream is now dreamt
again on the Web.
Martin Luther King Jr. \v personal
visions were cut short when he was as
sassinated, but on the Net they are still
celebrated in connection with the ob
servation of his birthday Jan. 15.
King is a favorite subject for Web
sites, and many of them show off the
Net at its best.
Our favorite King site comes from
Stanford University's Martin Luther
King Papers Project
(www.stanford.edu group/King), a
major research effort to collect and
disseminate historic documents. The
site contains several important sec
tions — autobiography, biography,
chronology — and some of the most
famous of King papers, such as the
I l >h 3 "Letter from Birmingham J ail."
— from the Jan. 1 1 issue of
The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
