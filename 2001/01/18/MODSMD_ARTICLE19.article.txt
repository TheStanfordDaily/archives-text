plans to integrate parts ol the Hoover
and main I niversit\ libran collections.
I ntler the proposed plan, approxiniate

and non-archival Hoover materials
won It I he moved to (.reen I ibrarv.
( J lief among our concerns is the issue ol
limited spat e. I loover's collection has out
go >w n the tower and its auxiliat \ built lings,
bul (.reen is also oversttilled.
While moving materials to (.reen could
make them more accessible to students be
t au.se ol longer open hours ant 1 greater t on
venience, the limited spat e at (-reen t oultl
cause I he toilet lion to be moved to more re
mote locations in the near future, ultimate
ly limiting at t essibility.
