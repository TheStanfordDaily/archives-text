ol claih lile: voin pri\acv. ( ongrcss is
now contemplating much-needed legis-

I lie allorne\ general will likeh he the
enforcing agent ol am new legislation,
.ind Ins interpretation ol that legislation
will influence priv.u \ regulation loi \e.ns
to come.
Ashcroft's enforcement ol privae\ laws
could |)la\ a huge role in shaping out .u
tivitics online, loi tun.itch , he is well
vet sed in technological issues, as shown
through the lech-fricnelh legislation he
proposed while still a senator. However,
his Puritan opposition to online poi nog
iaph\ he supported the unconstitu
tional ( oniniunuations Decenc\ Act
suggests tli.it he tna\ not he vcr\ sunpa
thetu to measures protecting Internet
privac\.
Also, Ashcroft has a reputation for
being trienelh to big business, the people
from whom we need our privacv
protec ted.
I do not think it is right to attack
Aslu roll loi his conservative, pro
life beliels — holding such views
while in pit bin oft ice is obviously his
1 iglit. Indeed, the vociferous attacks
on \sh< rolt con(crning these beliels
do not seem to be hindering him
Ironi confirmation, lie has pledged
to enforce existing laws, even w here
Ihev ( outr.ulic t Ins beliefs.
However, speculating on the possible
policies he could eiilorcc once in office,
whether it is deciding to investigate the
AOI.-Timc Warner merger when cable
rates start increasing or stieing
\nia/on.com should it begin selling cus
lotnei data, is absoluteh necessary it we
are to make sine that the awesome powei
of the 11istiic Department will not ad
\ei sely ailed us.
Should Aslic toft's opposition focus on
the import.nice ol the power of the office
of attorney general and its effect on our
lt\cs. rather than on the personal beliefs of
the nominee. the\ would be more likeh to
prevail in bloc king Ashe roll's
(onfii malion.

I hew Hums is a first-\rar law student. He is
runrnll\ relaxing <il home in Austin.
