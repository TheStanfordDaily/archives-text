1 have followed soccei all in\ lile and
d.ihhlcd in coaching in \cais past, but I
can think ol lew othci coaches, at whaie\ -
ei level, who possess so mam talents
not just t.u ticalh and tcclnucalh but .ilso
in dealing with college-age players and
possessing a realistic view of the proles
sional game.
flic game in Hritain, and around the

world, has long benefited from coaches
from Scotland; it has been a pleasure to
<4c t to know Hohln and to wale h how lie

niediocritx to one that c.in be I.inked
along the best in the count r\. haul imag
ine how Stanford will replace him 01. in
