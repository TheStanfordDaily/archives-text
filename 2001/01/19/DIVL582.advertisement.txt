The Stanford Film Society Presents
Cinefest Saturday
Jan. 20 - Underground This hilarious surreal drama from Emir Kusturica is a <iJfcftia-H>.u-«
passionate rendering of Yugoslav history in the postwar era. During a WWII air raid, a diverse group of partisans hide out in an
enormous basement storeroom; years pass and long long after the war is over they remain hidden, convinced that the battle outside
is still raging. Dir. Emir Kusturica, Yugoslavia.
Jan. 27 - Three Seasons This is the first American film to be shot in Vietnam since the end of the war, Three stories offer
vivid portraits of characters like a flower girl, a street peddler, a cydo driver, a prostitute and an American. Dir. Tony Bui, Vietnam.
Feb. 3 - The Sum of Us Set in Sydney, Australia. The film explores the relationship between a (hetersexual) father and his
gay son as they look for their Ms/Mr. Right. A very natural, entertaining story starring Russell Crowe. Dir. Kevin Dowling, Australia.
Feb. 10 - Where is the Friend's Home? One of Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami's best films. 8 year-old Ahmed has
accidently taken his friend's notebook home with him. Fearing that his friend will be expelled if he can not submit his lesson the next
day, Ahmed sets off in search of his friend's home in the neighboring village. Dir. Abbas Kiarostami, Iran.
Feb. 17 - Waiting for Guffman A hilarious mockumentary about a community theater troupe from the town of Blaine.
Missouri and their attempts to mount a show in honor of the city's 150 th anniversery and realize dreams of stardom. This film is filled
with Odd-ball personalities and dead on satire. Dir. Christopher Guest, USA.
Feb. 24 - A Time to Live and a Time to Die The director draws heavily upon his own boyhood in this eloquent depiction
of childhood and adolescence that sees the immigration of his family from mainland China to Taiwan. Dir. Hou Hsia-Hsien, Taiwan.
March 10 - Proof Martin is a blind cynic who takes photographs to prove that the world he hears and touches is the same
one that other people see. He befriends Andy and has him describe his photographs to him. This new friendship arouses the
resentment of Martin's obsessive and manipulative housekeeper. Dir. Jocelyn Moorhouse, Australia.
