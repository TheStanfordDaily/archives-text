It's rare that the layers upon layers
of local government around here J ind
a reason to work together.
But there's a chance for the Hay
Area to work truly as an area and it
conies, unexpectedly, from the effort to
bring the Olympics here in 2012.
The hid for the Olympics, submitted
three weeks ago b\ the Bay Area
Sports Organizing Committee to the
U.S. Olympic Committee, may be
called the San Francisco bid, hut the
game's track and field events and its
opening and closing ceremonies will be
at Stanford University. The swimming
will be in Santa Clara and the gym
nastics will be in San Jose.
Events will take place in 11 coun
ties, as far afield as Sacramento and
Monterey.
That means the Olympics will pro
vide a unique opportunity for a level
of cooperation that cuts across tradi
tional political borders.
