Missouri Supreme Court Judge Ronnie White, center, waits before testifying in attorney general-designate John Ashcroft's confirmation hear
ing yesterday on Capitol Hill in Washington, D C. Judge White expressed anger that Ashcroft had blocked him from becoming a federal
judge by persuading the Senate that he had a history or overturning death sentences.
