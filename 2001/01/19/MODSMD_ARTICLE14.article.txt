Stanford, powered b\ its own plants, has noth
ing to leat from the (laliiornia energy c risis, hut
it could have something to learn from the re
minder that resources arc not inexhaustible.
I he I iliversit\ deserves praise for its volun
tary efforts to reduce energy usage in the wake
of the crisis, (lertain departments have volun
tarily dimmed lights, and SI AC is shutting
down parts of its operations dm ing peak ener
g\-usage hours.
Stanford's l.nerg\ Management (iroup op
erates the I nivcrsit\'s Energy Management
and (lout lolSv stein, which is responsible for en

ergy operations and conservation. The group is
to be commended for its efforts toward conser
vation, such as the Energy Retrofit Program, re
cycling initiatives and promotion of public
awareness.
We encourage the University to continue its
focus on environmental awareness and energy
conservation. We urge the administration and
the student body alike to take notice of (lalifor
nia's current crisis and further adjust their be
havior to honor the fragility of the environmen
tal balance of power.
I he K.nergy Management (iroup Web page
lists manv suggestions for energy conservation
that could be implemented at Stanlord. Ihe
hay Area's sunny c limate encourages not onlv
biking and walking but also using natural light
and solar power. In classrooms and of lit cs, Stan
ford would benefit fiom using natural light
when possible and keeping lights oil when

buildings are empty. Students can make .i sig
nificant contribution to conservation h\ shut
ting oil their computers when not in use.
Stanford is rich with academic resources de
voted to environmental management. All the
schools, particularly those of Karth Sciences, En
gineering and I lumanities and Sciences, house
faculty who designate environmental issues
among their areas of focus. ( her 70 c < mrses are
offered to students interested in the
environment.
Research centers like the Hopkins Marine
Station and the Institute for lnternation.il Stud
ies host programs and forums to further uncler
standingof resource management and environ
mental impact. Student groups like the Stan
ford Knvironmental Action Coalition and the
Stanlord Solar Cai project pursue the goal oi
sustainable living.

Stanfortl is in ,i position to leatl California in
the move toward energy efficiency and conser
vation. Ihe I niversity should take every op
portunity to eliminate unnecessary lighting and
power, encouraging students and neighbors to
do the same. Alternative sources of power such
.is wind .ind solar structures, should also be
implemented.
As a first step, let's turn the stairsteppers at
Iresidder Fitness into a generator. We could
probably power half the Quad.
