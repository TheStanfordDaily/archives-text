Wh.H <k< ins to me around this tunc ol
vcai is that the Rev. 1 >i. King was n< »i always
this popular. I mean, lie wasn't put in j.iil In
a groupof hissuppot ters. I le wasn't shot by
a great admirer. I here were a lot of people
who hated hint. I here were a l< »t of gr< nips
opposed to the entrant hisetnent ol hla< ks
in the South, integration ol schools and
huses and everything else that King
supported.
Its too eas\ to forget! lie odds that King
was lighting against. It's too easv to think
th.it civil lights progress was inevitable,
when instead it was earned only by
coin age. sa< tifice and hard wot kit there is
one tiling tli.it we should all reflet t on this
week, it is Kind's 1 111p<>pi ilat it\ with a large
segment ol the \merican population din
ing Ins lifetime.
I he battle lines ai e drawn over dillerent
issues in 'JOOl.but the sides are basically the
same. I he same people who supported
King support the proud < arriers ol King's
legacv like (esse |.k kson. I lie same people
who stood against < ml rights reformers in
the UMiOs stand against tlieni now.
I oda\, < ivil tights ( rusaders f<kus theii
efforts on old issues as well as new. I he dis
entraiK hisetnent problems ol the good old
da\s resurfaced in the 120(H) presidenti.il
election: I'redoniinanth bl.uk precincts
were equipped with lowei (jualitv voting
mat bines that resulted in more votes Ix'ing
thrown out. It's enough to keep an at tivist
busv.
And the Rev. |.t< kson does keep busy. I
sweat I've seen him making a spee< h in I al
lahasstr in the morning and leading a i all\

111 Los Angeles in the evening ot the same
dav. 1 he man is .ill ovei the place. Serbia,
( '.üba, you name it. Hie sun never sets on
Jesse Jackson.
Mam people hate him fdi it. I've seen
him lampooned in political cartoons, in
sulted 111 the editorials of conservative pa
pei s, slandered on news talk shows. People
s.i\ Ins 1 hetoric, often I<k using on the plight
of minorities, isdivisivcand hurts the coun
try. I'ro-litei s sav that he's not a "real (Chris
tian," because he supports reproductive
rights foi women.
1 here are a couple of things th.it could
cause the love and admiration of Martin
Lutliei King, |r. and the hatred and mis
ti 11st of Jesse Jackson to exist simultaneous
ly in America. ()ne is media exposure. With
talk shows, "Saturday Night Live" skits,
Welx .isis and 24-hour news channels, con
servative America niav have gotten more
|esse than it can handle.
l hc other reason that so main people
hate Jesse Jackson is that lie's still alive.
|Ac kson is a very powerful, motivated and
charismatic civil rights crusader, and he's
shown no signs of letting up. And that's
what worries people.
We can celebrate Martin Luthei King
dav once a year and forget about it for the
other M 4. |essc Jackson is around all the
time.
As for mvself. I don't mind so nine li tli.it
people like |ac kson are around all the time.
It helps remind us that the civil rights
movement didn't stop when King was as
sassinated. There's still work to be done.
I'm sure we've all been bombarded with
quotes from King's speeches this past week.
So I'll dedicate to the memory of the Rev.
Dr. King a quote from someone who died
before King was born.
Kugcne V. Debs, founder of the Ameri
c an Kailwav I tiion, was another sort of civil
rights crusader. He was white, an atheist
and .1 socialist. I le said this:
"While there is a lower class, I am in it;
wbile there is a c riminal element, 1 am of it;
while there is a soul in prison, I am not
tiee."
1 think that this quote beautifully de
s< ribes the compulsion that some people
feel to help others and to change the wav
the world works. These people risk — and
sometimes lose — their lives tocontinuc the
struggle.
No matter how much everyone loves
King, remember that someone hated him
enough to shoot him. There will always Ik
opposition.

Kugcne V. Debs, founder of the Ameri

while there is a soul in prison, I am not

No matter how much everyone loves
King, remember that someone hated him
enough to shoot him. There will always Ik
opposition.

This wick has been .1 natural time

enjoved the holiday on Mont lav.
And I'm sine we .ill thought to ourselves
what a great guv Martin Luther King, |r.
was. Meanwhile, modern civil rights lead
ers like Jesse |ackson get no such love.
King's astonishing popularity gives him
the (listin< tion of being the only \mei ican
to have his own national holidav. I Ins ises
pecialh impressive considering that even
Washington and Lincoln have to share .1
