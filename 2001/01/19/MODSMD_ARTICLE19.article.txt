Stanford's confidence got an
other boost during its match on
Wednesday against California as
the Cardinal easily handled the
Bears in three games.
Nieves gave tour of his usual
starters the night off, starting
sophomore middle blocker Paul
Botage, sophomore outside hitter
William Curtis, junior outside hit
ter Kyle Straclie and freshman
libero |onathan Anderson for the
first time this season.

strong performances, with Curtis
posting a team-high lit kills and
three service aces and Borage
adding I I kills while hitting .770
for the match. Anderson led the
team delensivel\ with seven digs

on the night.
"Every time you get on the
court, it's an opportunity to prove
yourself." Anderson said. "1 think
all of us out there did a good job ot
that tonight."
Stanford made quick work ot
California in the first game, scor
ing the first tour points and later
scoring eight in .1 row, as the Car
dinal put away a 30-13 win.

game.
1 lie Cardinal scored the first
eight points of game two 011 its way

offensive spark m the final game,

Dong Johnstone who picked up
five digs 111 the game, putting awa\
California 30-22 to close out the
match.
Nieves was pleased with his
team's performance 111 light of
only having three regular starters
011 the floor.
"Curtis, Bocage, Strache and
both liberos [Anderson and John

said. "It helps with the whole
team's confidence to have them re

Fhe only question left for Stan

against the Waves is whether it will
have the services of sophomore
