" Fhe housing market is so ex
pensive, Benson said, that "the

off campus don't anvniore. I sualh
50 percent ot those students on the

LEVON UTIDJIAN/The Stanford Daily
More than 100 Stanford undergraduate students are currently calling the
Sharon Green Apartments home due to a winter-quarter housing crunch The
luxury" complex is approximately a mile from campus, and tne free Mar
guerite Shuttle service is available for transport to and from the heart of the
University.
at Sharon (.reen, Housing Assign
ment Services was verv helpful.
"[They] did a very good job of
handling a trickv situation.'' Sul
meyer said. "I don't think toom.m\
people are upset to be here."
Although many of the students
at Sharon Green approve of the
apartments and their facilities,
there is no consensus tli.it living oil
campus is preferable to living on
campus.
"It is realh nice," said sopho
more Allie htts. "[ There is a] pool,
a sauna and you can reserve a large
room tor gathering."
But it given the choice. Pitts said
she would prefer to live on cam
pus.
"Basically, 1 spend all da\ at
campus and come back all night,"
she said. "It's different living oft

campus.
Vlan\ of the apartments in the
complex are suited for four stu
dents. with two bedrooms, a bath
room and common areas. There
are also three-bedroom apart
ments for groups of six.
Junior Cynthia Fung spent last
quarter in Washington, land
blamed her new home in Sharon
(.reen on a "bad draw number."
Fung knows some of the other
undergraduates living in the
apartments from her quarter in
Washington, land seemed to
have a favorable view of her hous
ing situation.
"I think it's really nice. You're
not as buried in campus lite," she
said.
Yet Fung does mention the has
sle of lia\ ing to drive over to cam
pus. The heart ot the I niversitv is
about a five-to-l()-minute drive or
a l")-to-20-minute bike ride from
the Sharon Green Apartments.
"1 am luckv to have a car," Sul

meyer said. "The Marguerite usu
ally arrives at Stanford around 25
minutes after or three minutes be
fore the hour.
Not all students were assigned
to the apartments by chance. Mc
\ iff and three of her friends chose
to live there together. She was at
Stanford in Paris last quarter and
withdrew from the Draw because
she wanted to live off campus.
"1 wasn't sure at first," she said.
But now that she has been at the
apartments for several days she
has begun to appreciate her living
arrangements. "As a junior it's
great. 1 enjoy the distinction be
tween school and home. It's nice to
have space."
However, undergraduates liv
ing at Sharon Green aren't com
pletely free from the normal dorm
hierarchy.
According to Pitts, Sharon
Green has two Resident Fellows
and a few Resident Assistants who
were recently chosen.
