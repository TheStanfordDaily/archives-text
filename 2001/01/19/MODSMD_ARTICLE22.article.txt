MATT SAYIFS/The Stanford Daily File
Junior Bethany Donaphin shoots over a Santa Clara player earlier this season While Donaphin
dominated in the earlv season, the forward has seen limited minutes lately for the Cardinal.
Cal is led by senior point guard
Courtney Johnson, who averages
a team-leading 12.4 points. John
son is just the type of quick guard
that has been troublesome tor the
tall Stanford squad.

Hears are going to pull away with
the victory. Corlev averages 16.4

While the Hears are quick, they
I.k k the strong perimeter shooting
of ()regon and ()regon State that
destroyed the Cardinal last week
end, whic li should allow the Stan
ford to locus more energy on de
fense in the lane.

The key to the game for Stan
ford rests in utilizing its size to its
advantage and preventing Cal's
guards from racking up shots.
There isn't a player on the Cal
roster that can match up with se
nior Carolyn Moos and junior
Corey Knghusen. While both of
the Cardinal's big women seem
to be playing with weakened con
fidence lately, this is a game 111
which they could really take
over.
Freshman point guard Nicole
Powell also needs to stay calm and
take care of the ball, preventing
(lal's Johnson from stealing for the
easy break away. She leads the
conference in rebounding and is
third 111 assists, in addition to her
team-leading 13.4 points a game.
Not bad fora freshman plaving .111
unfamiliar position.
Assuming Powell plays well .it
the point, and at least one inside
player steps up for the Cardinal,
Stanford will be in good shape. If
junior guards Lindsey Yamasaki
and Lauren St. Clair can hit the
consistent three-pointer they arc
capable of, the Cardinal should be
looking at its first road victory of
the season.
