"|( '.ousti in lion] is alwavs down

Mareiiicss. "Its die nature of die

business. Hut il we're going to sui

well worth it in the end."
As ol yesterday, about three
li>lll ilis ol the seats had been put
m plaee along the first base line
.iikl behind home plate, begging
the question of whether the series

could oiilv hold liall-< apac il\ next

"Sure we would |plavj," said
Marquess in an interview on
Wednesday. "We'd have to block
oil some .usles because ol salctv
concerns, and the construction
people would lake (are ol that."
Marquess considered the
prospects ol having "about 1.000
seats, and anodic) couple bun

died on the giass\ hill along the
til si base line.
"Realistically, we're not going
to have much more [people ill the
stands| than that toi that series
[against Fresno State]. 1,000
would be a good ( rowd, but I just
don't know what tliev are going to
have d(me."
However, construction work
ers have said that the\ are going
"to get it all rcadv" b\ opening
dav, and Marquess s.tid that he is
hopeful lh.it everything will be

And it all the ( hanges have not

"They're realh working their

tails oil out there. II you come out
here at five o'clock in the morn

Ihe biggest limiting facloi the
past couple ol weeks has been
rain, which i(>rced the stoppage ol
work for two da\s lasi week. Hut
with no rain in the upcoming lore
cast, workers will most likeh have
the opportunitN to work stiaighi

ter a little iiKonveniente, it will he
well worth it in the end."
As ol yesterday, about three
li>lll ilis ol the seats had been put
m plaee along the first base line
.iikl behind home plate, begging
the question of whether the series
would still he played it the stadium
could oiilv hold liall-< apac il\ next
I riday.
"Sure we would |plavj," said
Marquess in an interview on
Wednesday. "We'd have to block
oil some .usles because ol salctv
concerns, and the construction
people would lake (are ol that."
Marquess considered the
prospects ol having "about 1.000
seats, and anodic) couple bun

died on the giass\ hill along the
til si base line.
"Realistically, we're not going
to have much more [people ill the
stands| than that toi that series
[against Fresno State]. 1,000
would be a good ( rowd, but I just
don't know what tliev are going to
have d(me."
However, construction work
ers have said that the\ are going
"to get it all rcadv" b\ opening
dav, and Marquess s.tid that he is
hopeful lh.it everything will be
< omplcted.
And it all the ( hanges have not
been finished l>\ next Friday, it
will surelv not be due to .i lack ol
efloi t.
"They're realh working their

tails oil out there. II you come out
here at five o'clock in the morn
ing, the lights ,ne oil, and ilie\ re
pouring (cement | oi working on
something else," Marquess said.
Ihe biggest limiting facloi the
past couple ol weeks has been
rain, which i(>rced the stoppage ol
work for two da\s lasi week. Hut
with no rain in the upcoming lore
cast, workers will most likeh have
the opportunitN to work stiaighi
through the week.
Fortraditionalists, Marquess is
qui( k to point out t hat. I he
( hanges that li.t\e been made will
in no wa\ allei the i<>/\ atmos

"We have not ( hanged Sunken

Diamond, we have oiil\ made it
more comfortable loi everyone."
