Steven Soderburgh is on one of those hot
streaks that directors have drooling dreams
about. After "The Limey" last fall, "Erin
Brockovich" this past summer, and "Traf
fic," Soderburgh has a Midas touch-thingj
going. He could do a "Mighty Ducks" sequfl|
at this point and it would fill the seats.
There's nothing wrong with it, thoufldma
after "The Limey" and his dark tale aJififl
venge that featured seamlessly
clips of a 70s Terence Stamp movisJ9H|
David-hva-poshup-bra vs. Goliath
ovich," and now this frank look at
war. Soderburgh is possiblv the most versa*j
tile director in Hollywood right now.
ItV all three, he has been able to coax in
credible performances out ol his all-star
casts. In all three, he has created deeply^

human charactefipvy) «>l the three are in
novative, visually. Ail three have treated the
