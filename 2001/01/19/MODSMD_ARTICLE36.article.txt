2. Finincm - "The Marshall Mathers Ll'"

(lontroversy has nothing to do with how
iii( i edihly good his music is; even critic s
who don't agree with his messages admit to the
quality ol his work.
;i. Dr. Die - "Dr. Die — 2001"
"Forgot About Die" is an ironic title, because
he obviously isn't forgotten with the number
of albums sold and his popularity.
4. (.reed - "Human (.lay"
Soulful musk that clearly resonates with a
wide audience; "With Arms Wide ()pen" is es
pecially thought-provoking because of the
topic of the song.

realistic portrayal ol modern urban lilc. Filmed with hand

1) "1 ligli Fidelity"
I am so surprised that this is m\ luunbei oiu', I don't realh know \\ hat tosa). (lusat k was and wasn't
the same charactei he always is. the movie is definitely onlv ahout relationships, and I likt-d it. I
think that is the real accomplishment here, lolks, since 1 haven't like a movie with this premise in a
long time.
2) "Magnolia"
l.ast year, you say? I don't care, it was actually released in 2000, and in an otherwise weak year,
you've got to stretch sometimes I his tale ol redemption was |iist awesome to me. So many despi
cable characters, so many disgusting thoughts, so hum h utter humanity!
3) "Traffic"
Hunk Steven Soderlmrgh's happy ahout this vear? I haven't seen "hiin Bro< kovit h," hut by all ac
counts, Soderburgh stored a hat trick this year, lint Flic's right ahout " The Limey;" you really
might pick the Tei ranee Stamp masterpiece ovei this one alter some time. " I rallu " is not better,
just llashier.
4) "Crouching I iger, Hidden Dragon"
Would have been nuinbei one, il onh the\ had (ought more. Who wasn't on the edge ol his seat

have created a new standard with their work on tins one.
