# Transition' plays like That '70s disc
## 
### SARAH MEARON STAFF WRITER 
When a record plays like a
soundtrack to Burt Reynolds's ca
reel during the '70s, it is not .1 good
tiling. "1 ransition," the new .ilhum
from Sad Rockets, is |ust that
record.
We evolve fora reason and, al
though hahy-boomers may harbor
nostalgia for blue leisure suits,
"Honey M" tunes and the TV
drama "Chico and the Man," the
world has since advanced, thankful
ly. I'ufortunately, Andrew I'ekler,
the man behind Sad Rcxket.s, is
stuck in a '70s time warp.
Musicians, like all artists, hold a
lot of respect for those who went be
fore them, citing band after band as
.1 "major influence" on their work.
I ndoubtedly what makes their

music appeti/ing is that they have
integrated the rhythms and sounds
developed 111 the past to come up
with their own exclusive musical ex
periments.
With "Transition," I'ekler has

missed out on this aspect entirely.
Almost every track reeks of a 70s
polite-detedive television series
soundtrack. Moreover, tlu- album
oozes mediocrity: In fact, it is dilfi
cult to distinguish between the vari
ous tracks, despite the multiple lis
tenings endured by this reviewer.
Hie album kicks oil with the stale
"Senio Junior," a track that initially

seems promising, with its l ortoise
meets-Daft funk sound. Alas, it
strives to be more sonic all\ provem a
tive than it is. which results 111 .1
rather l.i< Muster melody punc tn.it
ed l>\ sallow beats that gentl) lull the
listener to sleep.
Most of the other tracks on the
album are not .is ambitious as the
first, raising the question: was
I'ekler even trying? "K.xtra Medi
um" and "Twenty-Six" spark vi
sions of a pastv-faced Chachi-like
charac tei with a mullet haircut play

< lub: think elevator music meets the

The sound of a dripping faucet
tli.it dominates the first part of
Faucet Skank" seems like a
harbinger of a musically inventive
tune. much like the croaking frogs
of the Magnetic Kields's "Old Or
chard Beach." I lowever, a pleasant

ly deep, crum by melody that ku ks
111 alter 45 seconds of dripping is
soon drowned out In the redun
dant '70s revival sound that domi
nates the album.
A more adventurous tune,
"Wrongs of Kali," also fires up with
.11101 igmal mixture of sounds punc
tuated by a violin, whit h is ac tually
e|iiite appealing until six minutes
later when one wonders il the same
HO seconds of music haven't been
repeated .1 dozen times in a row.
I hey were hard tofind.but amid
the rank tracks of " 11 ansition" are a
few minutes of sonic success. "Win
ter's ()ver" is unlike any other track
on the album, adopting .1 folk inllii
ence by using an acoustic guitar and
bongos to garnei complexity and
emotion without losing its spine as it
progresses. "Twenty-Seven." un
like its prequel "Twenty-Six,"
makes an effort to evolve from slag

n.int 70s funk to something with
many more lavers that espouses
rather provocative sounds. I u
(loul>tc(il\ the most solid ti.uk on
the album, "Sad Rocket's Rock
Steady" combines horns unit ,i
funky beat to develop .1 more nu
lure, robust sound.
I'ekler seems to have been civ
atively incapacitated 101 niu<h ol
the production ol the album \i
though most tracks espouse (ookn

th.it are p.imlulh long, both "\\ in

li.is the ability to make good music
if only he took some risks. " I ransi

tion required of a fabulous, or e\< 1
a mediocre album. If a '70s revival
what you crave, save your monc
and catch some re-runs of "Tin
Rockford Files.'
