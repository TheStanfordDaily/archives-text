alarm clock.

in store. It's a bit like visual time travel. ()ne
ol the most interesting exhibits is Double

lined the walls with penciled renderings of.
Web pages. But these pages are from a site
c ailed Virtual I leaven. The site's purpose is
to ni\e grieving people a place to write let
ters to the departed. Yon get to read letters
t<» miscarried babies, cancer victims, acci
dent victims. It's morbid but compelling.
Something about the personal nature ol this
digitized medium makes you want to read
deep into the words to feel the virtual emo

tent to whit h our world can be reduc ed to Os

with vour sense ol perception. I won't spoil
the surprise here, but it's an impressive
trick.
1 here's a great room hill ol "Tvpes and
Prototypes." 1 lere von will find a little bit ol
history and a lot ol innovation. I here are
<|uirk\ little appliances from the 7>os, coin
pleteh impractical pieces ol Intunstu furni
ture, and, inexplicably, cool vintage movie
posters. Don't miss Frank (.elm's (\es, the
gu\ who did the Seattle Iwperience Musit
Project and the king ol structures that look
like they should fall apart) corrugated < ard
board chair, or the $300 tun replica in the
gift shop. Desks jut out at craz\ angles and
ret liners look like giant lobstei s.
The sheer numbei of monochromatic
canvases in the MoMA resonates with sell
deprecating humor — anyone who has seen
Yasmina Reza's play "Art" knows that peo
ple can convince themselves that they see
just about anything in modern art, even
w hen there really isn't anvthing there. Some
ol the monochrome artists get it right, no
tabl\ Rauschenberg. He uses texture in his
all-black painting to make it live and con
founds this cliche of modern art.
If you're in the mood for something com
pletely different, check out the gallery that
features as its centerpiece a huge ceramic
sculpture of Michael |ac kson, rendered as a
white woman with gold hair, and his 111011-
kev, Bubbles. It is uglv. A tainer
futuristic experience is Stella's painting
"Bridge." It pops with intense blues, and the
painted lights on the bridge seem to realh
glow. B\ painting the bridge and hardh giv
ing a thought to the water. Stella hints that
man-made things are triumphing over nat
ural elements.
Appropriateh enough for this \ear, the
Surrealists are prominenth placed in the
MoMA. Fnjoy a delightful Magritte, some
Dali, a urinal-cutn-work-of-art, and some
