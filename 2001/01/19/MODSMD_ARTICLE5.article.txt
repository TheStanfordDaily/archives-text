In her office yesterday, Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Robin Mamlet looks over one of 16,000 regular-deci
sion applications received from high school seniors.
"Stanford is very much per
ceived as a university at the cut
ting edge, with an entrepreneur
ial spirit, an impressive range of
excellencies that is not duplicat
ed elsewhere, and a notable com
mitment to undergraduate edu
cation. It is the institution to
watch on the higher education
landscape," Mamlet said.
Mamlet is concerned that the
level of competition in the ad
missions process harms high
school students.
"1 am particularly troubled by
the degree to which students feel
they must commit themselves to
a multitude of activities, so that
they are extremely 'busy' while
in high school — their time is
highly scheduled, the pressure is
tremendous and the reflection

is, frankly, slim," she said.
The highly competitive admis
sions process causes some stu
dents to think they need a "hook"
to get into a selective school. In
the past, some students have tried
gimmicks hoping to increase
their chances ot admission.
"We don't encourage gim
micks," said Assistant Dean ot
Admissions Hollv Hale\ knapp.
"Neither ot the two students 1
immediately think of [as ha\ mg a
gimmick] got in."
Some gimmicks simplv make
the reading process more ardu
ous: "Some students wrote their
essays in a spiral, said Senior As
sociate Director of Admissions
Anna Marie Porras. "Those are
very difficult to read."
However, in recent years, stu
dents have begun to avoid gim
micks to spend their time more
productively, according to
Knapp.
In order to select the best pos

sible class, readers in the Admis
si< nis (Mice read eath application
between three and four times.
Kach reader jots notes about
the application on a card, and
the main readers' comments are
reviewed in order to make the
best admissions decision. All
final dec isions to admit a student
are re\iewed b\ Mantlet.
"In this time of grade inflation
and packaging of applicants to fit
what others assume Stanford
seeks in its students, our chal
lenge is to find the ven bright
voting scholars for \n hotn success
is a b\product, not a goal, who
have achieved not because they
need to in order to get into col
lege. but because tlie\ love their
work," M,unlet said.
"We look for students who
are intellectuallv alive, who are
eager learners and indepen
dent thinkers, who will be lead
ers in the classroom and the
laboratories."
