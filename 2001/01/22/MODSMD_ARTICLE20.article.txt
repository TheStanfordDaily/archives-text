Ii ite to report, the apartments have ameni
ties such as a swimming pool, jac u//i. kitchens
and complementan breakfast. I he major
drawback is access to campus; earless students
are dependent on a Marguerite service that
usualh gets vou lo (lass much too early or
miK h too late and stops running well before
main parties are oxer.

al ive solution — however makeshift — thai
enabled it lo live up to Stanford's 4-year

guaranteed housing commitment. But the
solution necessitated more than "outside the
box" (or oil-campus) thinking; it required an
impressive financial investment.
One can't help but wonder, though,
whether such innovative arrangements, fran
tic remodeling and monetary expenditure on
Stanford's part would even have been neces
sary il the University had engaged in more
long-term enrollment planning.
Stanford has always been an attractive place
lor many thousands of high school students,
bul recently, it sheen one of the hottest colleges
in the country. ()ver the past three years, the
number of applications has skyrocketed
(reaching nearly 20,000 in 1999-2000) along
with the yield rate.
As ,i result, Stanford has experienced an
civeienrollment phenomenon that caused
the c ui rent housing crisis and shows no signs

of easing up. While one year of surprisingly
high yield is understandable, the admissions
office should have grasped Stanford's popu
larity, anticipated future high yields and ex
tended fewer offers in order to keep the un
dergraduate population within reason, i.e. in
accordance with the University's ability to
reasonably support that many students.
It's simply not fair to students to be forced to
live inconveniently because incoming classes
are ballooning out of sight.
Overall, Stanford's short-term handling
of the undergraduate housing crunch
made the best of an unfortunate situation,
but it's a shame that the University's lack of
long-range planning necessitated expen
sive last-minute damage control. I lopefully,
this crisis will serve as a wake-up call to the
Admissions Office to address the underly
ing factors that lead to overenrollment.
