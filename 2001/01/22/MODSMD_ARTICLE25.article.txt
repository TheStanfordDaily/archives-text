In his time at Stanford, men's soccer head coach Bobby Clark has turned a
losing team into a national powerhouse, earned conference coaching hon
ors, and watched his son Jamie, a former Cardinal standout, take the field
with the San Jose Earthquakes. Players say Clark has made the team feel like
a family.
