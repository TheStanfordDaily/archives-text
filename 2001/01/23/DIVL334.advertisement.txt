Stanford Open Space Dialogues
On Race And Ethnicity
In the past three years hundreds of Stanford students participated in race dialogues in 23 residences and
community centers. These students believed it to be essential to their education. Through these pro
grams, Stanford students joined and expanded the national conversation about race that began when
President Clinton launched the President's Race Initiative in 1997. Hundreds of other community groups
have held dialogues around the country to give meaning to this national conversation on race.
Purposefully designed to be small, groups of 8-16 students develop dialogues organically with a bit of
organizational assistance from facilitators assigned by the Office of Multicultural Education. Participants
commit to meet a minimum of 6 times for an hour per meeting. Participants share personal experiences
and collectively identify issues they wish to discuss. Dialogue groups are encouraged to brainstorm actions
at the end to improve race relations. Ground rules are used to ensure effective dialogue.
Intersections Format I
This year we are inviting students to propose and to join a dialogue that examines the intersections of
race with another identity. In particular, if you are interested in a race and sexual orientation or race
and gender discussion, please let us know. We will also entertain other proposals.
If you are interested in joining or hosting a race dialogue group this year either in your residence or a
different location, please send your name, race, preferred format, residence, and e-mail address to Leah
King (Iking@ Stanford). If you wish to have a dialogue group in your house, please also speak to a
Resident Assistant. The registration begins now and dialogues will have rolling starts that will begin as
soon as they can be scheduled and organized.
The Office of Multicultural Education sponsors the Race Dialogues and they are facilitated by the
Multicultural Education Training Organization (METrO) and student volunteers. Contact Tommy Lee Woon
