On Jan. 23, 1%1. I he Daily ran an arti
cle called "Chaplain Explains Right I nder
standing ot Sex."
" 1 he i ight understanding ot sex is some
where between the an.in hist and puritan
attitudes about it. Rev. I homas (lilby, ().P.,
dec lared in Arroyo lounge lasi night, speak
ing on 'Sex, Morals, and Marriage.
"The anarchist attitude, which is one ot
the noblest social philosophies that has ever
been devised, is that fnndatnentallv all ac
tion should be regimented by the noblest
sell." l he anarchist believes that 'sex is the
great liberator.' Rev. Cilby explained.
" I lie Dominican Father. (Catholic c hap
lain at (Cambridge I niversitx. believes that
Puritanism is the other extreme. Puritans,
both Catholic and Protestant, believe that
sex is something which is necessary to pro
duce babies, but which should usually be
kept secret.'...
"Father (iilby believes that the pi incipal
pin pose ol sex is a shared adventure, an ad
venture which should include procreation,
pleasure and friendship."
Bottom line: Sex, anarchists and a "shared ad
venture" â€” when was the last time you went to
hear a dorm speaker?
