There is a saying about both Har
vard and Stanford business schools
that no one ever turns down a place to
do an MBA there except to go to the
other.
Last autumn, though, Stanford had
a slightly different tale to tell, for one
student turned down a place at Stan
ford to go to, instead, the top-ranked
European school just outside Paris.
Though small in itself this anecdote
pinpoints two of the trends that are
shaping the MBA marketplace these
days. First, the cream of prospective
full-time students are increasingly
looking for international programmes
and global experience. Second, the
classic two-year MBA programme, the
original U.S. model, may finally be
challenged by the intensive one-year
programme.
