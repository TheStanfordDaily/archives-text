I lit' ret cm housing ( runt li lias put a new
spin On the concepi of Stanford residence
liven rowding. W illi the I niversitv s re
(cm s( tainhle to lind housing loi roughh 100 un
dergi adilaies this winter, this has never been as dra
matic an issue. Win do these students suddenh
find themselves homeless.
Mm li <>l the answei resides with the (let rease in
oil-campus housing options. I lowever, a more sig
nilii ,iiii cause ol the housing (i uuch is the ini lease
in undergiaduate eiirollnieni at Sianlord. I lie
challenge is now uiulli-lacctcd. Not onlv must the
I uiveisilN house .ill enrolled students, hut il also
needs i<> prevent (Ins situation limn occurring in
the future. I he Admissions ()flice should begin to
implement a variets of pre-existing, but rareh

used, polities and ( onirols.
1 he number of applicants t<> Stanford is sky
rocketing. lor the (lass ol 200.") alone, there are
10.000 applications. While the < l.iss ol 2000 had .t
10.1 percent acceptance rate with 01.3 percent
vield (i.e. the rale of ac< epted applicants whode( ide
to enroll), the (lass of 2001 had a 1.V2 pen cut a< -
ceptance rate with 00.1 percent vield.
I lie Admissions Office lias decreased the accep
tance rate, a nccessan outgrowth ol mi leasing appli
cations. I lowever. because more studentsarec boosing
to enroll at Stanford once admitted, i lass si/es contin
ue to exceed targeted nunibei s.
For the fii st few veai s of ibis trend, it was uiulei -
standable for housing to become more scarce be
cause the higher enrollments could not have been
predicted. I he vield rate depends on unpre
dictable factors and might decrease in the future.
Yet tins housing (rum li will pose problems lor the
next few veai s be(ause it is cleat that the Stanford

undergraduate housing < apac nv < an no longer atl
equateh compensate lor this over-enrollment.
I wo obvious options present themselves: Build
more housing and tlet lease enrollment to suit cur
rent housing capacitv. loi reasons of finance and
convenient e, the latter option should he pursued.
Instead <>l accepting ever more early admis
sions applit .1 nts eat h vear. w liich lot ks accepted
candidates into enrolling thereby leaving less
room loi regular applicants, Stanford should
tlelci a larger proportion of students.
I he Admissions office nevei composes more
than L\~> pen cut of each (lass from theearlv decision
pool. I hat admit ceiling must continue. Since so
mam hvpcr-qualified students appl\ to Stanford, a
large number slots should be reserved for regular
decision applit .mts.
Over the past few vears, however, the Admis
sions Office lias not reacted eflectivelv to the in
creased enrollment among regular-decision appli

c ants who have been accepted at Stanford. I he wait
list was originally created to fill in under-enrolled
classes. lb better control c lass sizes, Stanford should
make less offers of outright acceptance and put
more qualified applicants on the wait list to be
drawn from if a class remains under-enrolled.
The qualification gap between most accepted
students and those placed at the top of the wait list
remains minuscule if it exists at all. As a result, the
University would hardly sacrifice its academic
elitism In placing some students who might have
been accepted outright in past years onto the wait
list in the future.
The housing dilemma clearly indicates the need
for Stanford to reassess its undergraduate housing
and admittance procedures. By utilizing already
existing options, such as earlv-decision deferment
and the wait list, Stanford can both attract top stu
dents and ensure that the students already here
have a decent place to sleep.
