Some would argue that religion is the

Indeed, most religions require leaps of

religions strive, like s( ience, l(t explain
the elusive universal objective truth we

all scan li i<>i throughout our lives.

I o illustrate ni\ type of irrationali
t\, I'll take an example from a (liil
dren's book with which inanv are fa
miliar. In " 1 lie \'elveteen Rabbit," foi
(lln istmas a little bo\ receives a stuffed
rabbit that becomes a real-live,
hindlegs-ki( king rabbit with the help
of a fairy.
I he storv is fanciful enough, but the
point is that the lit tie bo\ whoow ned the
fake animal loved it so much that, in
time, the stuffed rabbit became real to
him. In the bov's mind, the labbit was
real and, fioni his point of view, the vel
veteen rabbit literallv becomes capable
ol joining the frolic king wailensof bun
tivdotn out in (lie wild.
Yet the lesson of this fantas\ need
not be limited to the pages of a c liild's
storybook. Our subjective experi
cik es should be able to assume a rcal
it\ as potent as that of the objective
w<>rl(l of the senses.
In fat t. many people accept irrational
perceptions as truth. For instance,
loved ones who die remain living in the
subjective experience of the individual
who loves tliedep.u ted persons. I 1 iis u -

beliefs based on emotional re

cause the scientific method remains
|iist as fallible due to its human origins
as the imagined transformation of a
stuffed animal into a real one.
Scientists scorn the faith peo pie
have in miracles and other phenome

and empiricism. It's high time those
scientists recogni/e they are placing
total faith in a system of defining the
world th.it is only one among main.
