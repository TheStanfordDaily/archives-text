tail to think 11 itk ally about things six h as
the "Asian Fvelid Surgery C enter." What
does ibis s,i\ about Asian-Americans? Do
we feel as though we need to alter our

I don't want Stanford to further ex
ploit the rat ism of Western hcautv. What
will Stanford Asian-Americans think of
their own single-lidded eves or their
li lends single-lidded eves? I am only ask
ing that we think about how this affects
our interpretation of beauty, conformity

and living in a country where not every
one is a member of the dominant, or
mainstream, culture.
I low are -Asian / Latino / South Asian /
white / black Americans perceived?
Should we change who we are in order to
"fit in" to the mainstream culture? 1 ac
cept my Asian features and culture, and
it's time that everyone else does too. I
hope that we all engage in these Dialogues
on race and ethnicity, either through
Stanford's organized events or through
informal conversations with friends and
classmates.
