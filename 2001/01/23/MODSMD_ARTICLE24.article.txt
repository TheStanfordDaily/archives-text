### EZRA CALLAHAN STAFF WRITER 
Most people cheering for the Stanford men's
volleyball team in its match against top-ranked
Pepperdine on Sunday must have had doubts .it
least once that afternoon.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, the men on the
floor with Stanford jerseys on were not reach to
throw in the towel.
Hie No. 8 Cardinal (3-0, 1-0 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) opened its conference season bv
pulling off a come-from-behind victorv over the
No. 1 Waves (4-1, 1-1) in a five game thriller in
Maples Pavilion.
"We played with heart, and our adrenaline
won us this match," said junior outside hitter M.il -
eus Skacel, who had 19 kills and a match-high 12
digs. "Stanford's got a vollevball team this vear.
We're legit."
After coming from behind to win game four
and even the match at two games apiece, Stanford
found itself down 13-11 andonlv two points awa\
from defeat in the 15-point, rally-scoring fifth
game. But the Cardinal took the next four points,
forcing three consecutive Pepperdine errors to
take the decisive game 15-13 and upset the top
ranked team in the nation.
"It looked bleak in games four and five, but
when we needed it most, the guys stepped up and
responded," said head coach Ruben Sieves.
It also helps when you've got a player named
Curt Toppel. The sophomore outside hitter p< >st-

Ed .i match-high 30 kills while also picking up 10
digs.
"It's verv tiring in a five-game match to get so
many sets," Toppel said. "1 was up and down, but
1 managed to hit mv best when we needed it."
Toppel and the other Stanford attackers ran
into a fierce Pepperdine block throughout the
contest, the Waves outblocking the Cardinal 20-
1 0 for the match and 5-0 in the final game. How
ever despite the statistics, Nieves still liked what
he saw from the Stanford net game.
"Our blinks were timely," Nieves said. "We
didn't blink a lot of balls, but we made the big
blocks right when we needed them."
Stanford looked very strong early in the match,
jumping out to a 13-9 lead. Pepperdine battled
back to take a two-point lead at 25-23. The teams
exchanged leads twice more before Stanford fi
nallv pulled out a 30-28 win on a Pepperdine
error.
The first-game loss seemed to tire up the
Waves' squad, although Stanford still seemed to
have the upper hand as the Cardinal took an 18-
1 5 lead in the second game.
The Pepperdine offense caught tire, led bv ju
nior outside hitter Lance Walker's seven kills, and
the Waves took game two, 30-25. Pepperdine hit
.485 as a team in the game, the first game Stanford
dropped all season.
I lie Waves overcame an earlv deficit in game
three as well and held off several attempts bv the
( animal to take bai k control of the game. Despite
posting onlv a . 175 hitting percentage, the Waves

took a 2-1 lead in tlie- match with .1 30-26 game -
three victory.
"We knew that Pepperdine would make us pa\
tor even mistake we made, and in games two and
three, they did just that," Sieves s.iid.
The fourth game was a r<)llercc)aster, with both
sides unable to maintain si/able leads. Pepperdine
took advantage ot several earh errors bv the ( ar
dinal, forcing Stanford to call a timeout at 1 ()-(>.
But Stanford fought back to even the game .it lb
lb before a kill bv Skacel, one of seven he had in
the game, put Stanford up 24-21.
A block bv Toppel and sophomore middle
blocker Paul Bocage extended the Stanford lead
to four at 28-24, but the Waves took finished two
long rallies with blocks on their wa\ to tving the
game .it 28-28. Bocage came up with .1 huge kill
on the next point, and an error b\ Pepperdine
middlebltxker Brad Keen.in g.i\e .1 30-28 win to
Stanford.
Throughout the match, the Stanford bench
kept the team fired up, both on the court and on
the sidelines. 1 he (Cardinal got nine kills and five
blocks from its bene h, but more importantlv the\
got a whole lot ot noise when the team needed it
most.
"We got alb-man effort out there," Nieves
said. "1 felt like we were going after Pep pert lint
wit h lb guvs, not just the b on thecc>urt"
