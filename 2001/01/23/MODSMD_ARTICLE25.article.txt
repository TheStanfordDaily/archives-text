In Arizona, Misty Hyman can do no
wrong. After being thrust into the interna
tional spotlight this summer in Sydne\ as
the gold-medalist in the 200-meter butter
fly, the Phoenix native became the pride of
the Sunshine State. This weekend, the (Car
dinal senior took her golden touch back to
her home state, winning five individual
events in dual-meet action .it Arizona St.ite
and Arizona.
Hyman led No. 4 Stanford (4-1, 1-1 Pa
cific 10 Conference) over the No. 1 / Sun
Devils (4-4. 0-h. 159-138, on Friday. How
ever. the Cardinal was unable to repeat Sat
urday .it Tucson, falling to the third-ranked
Wildcats (4-1, 1-0) 135.5-107.5.
In Tempe, Hyman wowed her home
town crowd, handily winning individual ti
tles in the 200 butterfly, 200 backstroke and
100 butterfly. Both of Hvman's times in the
butterfly were good enough to meet the
NCAA automatic qualifying standard and
frustrate her Arizona State opponents. I he
closest any Sun Devil came to catching
Hvman was junior Sarah Baham s runner
up finish in the 100 butterfly, in which she
trailed Hvman's time of 53.97 seconds by a
full 2 seconds. Baham was also the runner
up in the 200 butterfly, in which she was eas
ily outpaced, finishing second at 2:03.05 be
hind Hvman's 1:56.04. Hvman's time of
1:59.20 in the 200 backstroke met the NCAA
"B" qualify ing standard.
Junior Jessica Foschi was also a triple win
ner against the Sun Devils. Foschi, a dis
tance specialist, won the 1,000 freestyle
(9:57.25), 500 freestyle (4:53.49) and 400 in
dividual medlev (4:23.88). Foschi swam

some <>112 the top times in the countrv earlier
this season .it the Texas Invitational. She
cruised to victory in her longest event,
touching the wall 1 1 seconds before Arizona
State's Amanda Stanford.
Freshman Tara Kirk, the Cardinal's top
breaststroker, had an impressive Pac-10
debut. Kirk won the 100- and 200-meter
breaststioke and swam .i leg of Stanford's
winning 200 medley relay. Kirk's time in the
100 breaststroke (1:01.12) is an NCAA auto
matic (ju.ilih ing time.
I lie (Cardinal won 12 of 16 events. ()ther
individual winners included senior Erin
Soiies. who posted a career-high 258.53 in
her one-meter platform win and got an
NCAA automatic qualifying score in her
three-meter platform win, and redshirt ju
nior Lauren I hies. Thies, returning to the
lineup after a nursing back injury last sea
son. won the 200 freestyle in 1:51.10.
With its first Pac-10 victory in hand, the
defending conference champion Cardinal
traveled to I ucson to battle conference-fa
vorite Arizona. Even the heroics of Hyman
and Foschi couldn't lead the tired Stanford
sqtiad over a Wildcat team blessed with
depth. Though the Cardinal claimed the
top finisher in seven of the 13 events, Ari
zona found its wav into the No. 2 and 3 fin
ishes often enough to overcome the victo
ries.
Hvman again claimed the crown in the
200 butterfly, bettering Friday's finish by
four-tenths of a second. She won her other
individual event, the 200 individual medley,
and swam a leg on Stanford's winning relay.
Foschi repeated her wins in the 1,000-
and 500-meter freestyle. She shaved three
