### AARON LEVINE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If the opening 6-5 loss to ( .il Poly San
Luis ()bispo on Sunday is any indie ation
of what is to come for the Stanford base
ball team this season, then hop onto (lit*
emotional roller coaster and hold on
tight.
The No. 11 C '.ardinal (0-1) fought back
from 4-0 and 5-3 deficits to extend the
opener to extra innings, only to lose the
four hour and 20 minute marathon in
the bottom of tht* 12th inning. Stanford
reliever John Hudgins walked Mustang
Scott Meal with the bases loaded to give
Cal Poly only its fifth win in the 11 -game
history between the two schools.
Playing before an overflow crowd of
3,110 in the first-ever game at Baggett
Stadium, the ('.ardinal had its back
against the wall for much of the game,but
showed character in sta\ ing close.
Down 5-3 with two outs in the ninth
inning, junior ( hi is () Riordan knocked
in two runs on a double to the gap in
right-center field, scoring pinch runner
Carlos Quentin and Steve Cantenbein.
()'Riordan, who had struggled earlier in
the game In going 0-for-3 .it the plate

.iiul by committing .111 erroi on the field,
showed his maturit\ .is .1 team leader
with such a timeK hit to tie the game.
In the 10th inning, Stanford dodged
another bullet when freshman Brian
Hall threw .1 perfect strike from left field
to catcher Ken lirpack who tagged out
the potential ( al Poh winning 1 tin at the
plate. Hall had needed to 111.ike the
throw after junior shortstop Scott Drag
icevich committed the fifth Cardinal
error of the da\ when .1 ground I).ill took
a wild bounce through Dragicevic li s
legs.
In its previous 2 j games. Stanford
had onl\ committed more than two er
rors once, talh ing foui erroi sin .1 Supei
Regional game against Nebraska last
year. With five in vestercl.u s game, head
coach Mark Marcjuess could not have
been pleased, considering lus original
goals coming into the game were solid
defense and pitching.
Furthermore, Stanford's first en or of
the dav allowed (.al Poly to take a 1-0
lead in the bottom of the first inning.
I he Cardinal pitching got off to an
ominous start .is well before eventualh
settling in. Junior starter Mike Cosling
gave up four runs in the first inning,

three of which wet e earned on a triple In
Mustang Chris Martinez, Gosling
pulled after one inning of work in favoi
<>! sophomore lint Cunningham, who
kept the Mustangs scoreless for the next
H 2 3 innings.
Junior Jeff Bruksch then held the
Mustangs at ba\ for another 2 2 3 in
nings. After Cal I'oh stored its fifth run
in the bottom of the eighth inning, junior
Mike Wodnicki kept the game tight In
pitching 2 1 H scoreless innings until the
freshman Hudgins came on late in tlx
1 lie losing effort overshadowed <i ca
reei da\ for Stanford sophomore catch
er Rvan Garko, who went H-for-4, in
cluding .in RBI single in the top of the
second inning that gave Stanford its fii st
run of the season. 1 lie Cardinal scored
its second run later in the inning when
