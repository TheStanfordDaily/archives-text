For .1 while I steered dear of the
tcchie-fu//ie briat pate h. until one aflci
noon when I lunched with m\ doim's
computer science team and noticed,
upon reaching fin im bookbag, that ev
ervone was wearing white socks 1 spent
the next week glancing at .inkles, rum
maging through m»< k drawers and even
hiking up an unsuspecting dot inmate s
pant leg to test mv tin sis.
I he difference between tec hies and
tu//ies, I can now saw is in their socks:
I'echies wear white ones, while fu//ies
frown on anv shade lighter than gray.
1 he white-sock dark-sock debate
shows that the wat between form and
function has reached the feet. Whereas
tec hies prefer the co/iness of aw bite tube
sock, fu//ic-s opt for the decorum of a
dat k sock or an argvle.
For tec lues, white socks are another
thing thev clo not need to worn about.
Standard and reliable, tliev can accom
pan\ any outfit from shorts to khakis, al
though onh the most committed white
sockets are willing to stick with athletic
socks through interview season.
Andy Perkins, a seniot majoring in
electrical engineering, confessed to
wearing white socks with sandals, an
avant-garde statement popular among
the reigning technicians that 111.ikes
main nattilv-clad humanists see red.
Perkins, however, remains unapolo
getic about Ins occasional sandal-sock
combo. "This way, I've maximized 10111-
fort on both fronts," he said.
Fuz/.ies, on the other hand, view
socks as another venue fot stvle and
expression. I he fact that fu//ies are
evaluated not simplv cni their masten

of the assigned material hut also on
llicit .il)iln\ to present it, imbues them
with a sense ol the import.nice of
appearance.
\< tording to senioi Relict < a Rcttig, a
double majoi m lnstoi \ and I- nglisli, and

there is more human interaction, ulm Ii

()f com se. this statement assumes ih.ii

ers, senior (iollcen Shaw. a veteran of the
Stan fort I Shopping (Icntei s ha nana Rc

Admittcdiv, there .ue also some gra\
areas in the war between wbite and d.u k
sot ks. Not all majors line up so neatb
under the heading of lechie oi fu//v.
Minn.in biology, psvcholog\ and eco
nomics are all disciplines that permit
theii students tt» dabble in various sock
exchanges.
I lien there's the famous rase of the
male engineer who alwavs wears dark
sot ks with his jeans and dress shoes.
What explains his non-eonformitv? lie
studied in Merlin and returned to the
States with a Kuropean dislike for color
less sot ks.
Kven in a world with more exceptions
than i ules. there is still room lor a guide
line or two. Stick connoisseur Rcttig
adds, " 11ist make sure that voiii sot ks al
wavs match your shoes. Michael Jackson
made dark pants, dark shoes and white
sotks look good in the 'HOs, but that's
over now."
And what should the concerned stu
dent do tt> am one seen breaking the
Rcttig Rule? Sock it to cm. 1 saw
