## 'Zona women open the door for Card 
### WILL OREMUS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A disastrous weekend for the Ari
zona women's basketball team has put
the ( )regon Ducks in the driver's seat of
the Pacific 10 (Conference, while giving
Stanford something to cheer about, for
once.

WOMEN'S PAC-10 ROUNDUP

I wo straight road losses to confer
ence bottom dwellers USC (6-9, 1-4
Pac 10) and UCLA (3-13, 2-3) on
I htirsdav and Saturday, respectively,
have plunged the Wildcats into a
three-way tie for second place in the
conference with upstarts Washington
and Arizona State.
Arizona was silting pretty atop the
conference standings prior to what
figured to be a routine road trip to
Southern California. Hut hot shoot
ing from the Women of Troy and an
explosive performance In the Bruins'
Michelle Creco put the skids on Ari
zona's seven-game win streak and sul
lied iis unblemished conference
record.
In I hursdav's contest, USC fresh
men Jessica Cheeks and Ebony Hoff
man combined for 35 points to lead a

balanced Trojan attack to an SI-07
victory. Although guard Reshea Bris
tol and forward LaKcisha I avlor (on
tinned their hot shooting for the
Wildcats, neither was as effective
overall as they have been in recent
weeks. After twice being named Pac
-10 Player of the Week, Bristol com
mitted 10 turnovers while garnering
just 3 assists, while lavlor fouled out
in the closing minutes.
"We just got beat in every phase of
the game," said Arizona coach |oan
Bonvicini. "[I S('.) just wanted n tnoie
and it showed in everything."'
After a whole dav to think about
their performance, the Wildcats
failed to atone for their mistakes on
Saturday, losing .» tough overtime
contest 59-56 to the surprising Bru
ms. Strong performances of I the
bench by I >sell Bozeman (17 points)
and Veranda James (eight points, 13
rebounds) were not enough to over
come limited prodtu lion from I avloi
.ind Bristol again. I lie usualh higli

After a dismal 1-12 start to the sea
son, UCLVs brutal schedule seems to
be paying off as it has won two of its
last three. On Saturday the Bruins
