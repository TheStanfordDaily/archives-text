Washington 72, Oregon 71 (OT):
I wo (lut( h baskets by freshman guard
( iirtis Allen, a game-tying layup with
I I seconds left and the game-winning
laviip with |iist seconds remaining in
die extra session, led underdog Wash
ington to .111 overtime victory at ()regon
I hiirsda\. I halo( ireen led the 11nskies
with 22 points, but it was the late-game
heroics of Allen — a reserve averaging
|iist nndei five points per game — that
propelled Washington to victory. The
I'ac-lOs leading scorer, Oregon for
ward Hi \.in Hi .i< ey, had 23 points and
10 rebounds, but it was not enough to
combat his team's atrocious shooting.
()ne ol the most precise shooting teams
m the l'ac-10, the Ducks shot just 34
percent from the field and 3-01-22 (13

percent) from 3-point range in their
loss to the Huskies, who won their sec -
ond overtime game in a week.
The Skinny: And then there was
one. With UCI-A's loss to Arizona on
Saturday, Stanford is now the lone un
beaten team in ilit* Pat-10 after three
weeks of conference play.
Formerly unbeaten in the confer
ence, UCLA had its six-game winning
streak snapped in Tucson thanks to a
complete and utter collapse in the sec
ond half . Jason kapono was lion ible in
the loss, doing nothing to combat Ins
growing reputation of coming up short
in big games. It is true that the Bruins
have sometimes been hurt by the spot
ted play of point guard Earl Watson,
whose hip injury and early foul trouble
limited him to just three points and zero
assists in 14 minutes, but it has been
Kapono's inconsistent play that has
killed UCLA in the team's losses. Forget
the fact that he still insists on wearing
that horrible white adidas headband,
Kapono has disappeared in each of the
Bruins' losses so far this season — in
