Washington 72, Oregon 71 (OT):
I wo (lut( h baskets by freshman guard

I I seconds left and the game-winning
laviip with |iist seconds remaining in
die extra session, led underdog Wash

I hiirsda\. I halo( ireen led the 11nskies
with 22 points, but it was the late-game
heroics of Allen — a reserve averaging
|iist nndei five points per game — that
propelled Washington to victory. The
I'ac-lOs leading scorer, Oregon for
ward Hi \.in Hi .i< ey, had 23 points and
10 rebounds, but it was not enough to
combat his team's atrocious shooting.
()ne ol the most precise shooting teams
m the l'ac-10, the Ducks shot just 34
percent from the field and 3-01-22 (13

percent) from 3-point range in their
loss to the Huskies, who won their sec -
ond overtime game in a week.
The Skinny: And then there was
one. With UCI-A's loss to Arizona on
Saturday, Stanford is now the lone un
beaten team in ilit* Pat-10 after three
weeks of conference play.
Formerly unbeaten in the confer
ence, UCLA had its six-game winning
streak snapped in Tucson thanks to a
complete and utter collapse in the sec
ond half . Jason kapono was lion ible in
the loss, doing nothing to combat Ins
growing reputation of coming up short
in big games. It is true that the Bruins
have sometimes been hurt by the spot
ted play of point guard Earl Watson,
whose hip injury and early foul trouble
limited him to just three points and zero
assists in 14 minutes, but it has been
Kapono's inconsistent play that has
killed UCLA in the team's losses. Forget
the fact that he still insists on wearing
that horrible white adidas headband,
Kapono has disappeared in each of the
Bruins' losses so far this season — in

cluding Ins (') point show ing against ( al
State-Noil In idgc and his 2-for-l0
shooting against (ieoi gia Ic< h.

plays well, I ( LA li><>ks like .1 top-10
team, as evidenced In its recent six
game winning streak during which lie
averaged an All-American-like 20
points per game. But when he has an off
night, watch out. I CL \ can, and prob
ably will, lose to anvone, .is the team has
shown all season. As the season pro
