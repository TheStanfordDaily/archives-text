### 
Phoenix native Misty Hyman made her trip back to
the desert a successful one, as the senior swimmer
led the Cardinal to a 159-138 dual meet win over
Arizona State last week, with victories in the 200-
meter butterfly, 200 backstroke and 100 butterfly

A great effort from the Cardinal, including senior
Brett Youngberg (above), led to a huge upset of No 1
Pepperdine Sunday at Maples Sopnomoio outside
hitter Curt Toppel led the way with 30 kills and junior
Marcus Skacel added 19 of his own
