## Turning a garage into an empire 
### NINA CANN-WOODE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It lus ilit' plot (»l .1 t.iirv tale. From the hum
l)le surroundings ot a one-car garage, two col
lege friends start a company that torever
changes the relationship between science and
industry.
But this is no tail a tale. It is the true story ot
l>avicl Packard and his partner William
Hewlett, 'H4, M.S. 'M 9, who passed awa\ last
week at his home.
fhe garage from which Hewlett-
Packard was born is now a state historical
landmark and the designated birthplace ot
Silicon Valley.
I ethnology was.it the heart of the compam
from the yen beginning. In 1937 Hewlett, a
graduate student under the guidance of Elec -
trical Engineering professor Frederick 1 er
tnan, designed and built an audio oscillator.
1 he oscillator, still used today, is an electronic
device that generates electrical signals in a tie
quency within the range ot human hearing.
When connected to a loud speaker, it produc cs
a clear tone.
I he audio oscillator was the first prac tic al
method for generating audio signals needed
in communications, geophysics, medicine
and defense work. It lias a wide variets ot
uses, such as long-distance surveying ot

buried or submerged pipes and testing audio
devices like microphones, loudspeakers and
amplifiers.
"I took [engineering]courses simply because
1 was interested,' said Hewlett, in a 1984 inter
view with San Jose Mercury News. "1 had no
idea of getting a degree and one day Terman
said, 'You know, I've been looking at your
record, and vou've been working on an inter
esting project in this resistance capacity oscilla
tor. I figure if you write that up as a thesis and
pa\ $25, vou could get an engineer's degree.'
So I did."
Hewlett and Packard set up operations in
their now-legendary garage, used a kitchen
oven to heat casings tor their oscillators — and
waited for customers. Their big break came
from Walt Disney Productions: The company
was interested in buying four oscillators for use
in the movie production of "Fantasia." The sale
ottered a dramatic jump-start to the company's
lagging finances. Soon, orders rolled in from
across the country.
Hewlett had an uncanny ability to under
stand how new technologies could become suc
cessful products in the marketplace. One ex
ample is the HP-.55, the first portable scientific
calculator.
After the company introduced a desktop
calculator in I9()S, Hewlett asked HP engi
neers to design something similar but small

enough to tit in a shirt pocket. W hen intro
duced in 1972, the HP-ii made the slide rule
obsolete.and revolutioni/ed the tec hnological
world.
But Hewlett prided himself on creating a
companv devoted to more than just cutting
edge technology. According to HP's web site,
"generous medical coverage, flexible work
hours, open offices, decentralized decision
making and employee 'coffee talks' were
among the main policies and practices
[Hewlett and Packard] instituted at HP."
"In the winter of 1957, [Packard and 1] were
concerned about the company growing and the
fact that we were afraid we d lose the personal
touch we felt was so important in the company,"
said Hewlett in 1986. "1 think we were the first
people to initiate this program known as Man
agement by Objective."
"So we drew up some objectives," Hewlett
continued. "[Those objectives] provided guide
lines for [our workers] and worked verv well: 1
went back and looked at these objectives, and
we've only added one additional objective since
then." 4
Hewlett was asked in 1997 what he would
tell voting people trying to balance stressful and
competitive science and technology careers.
"|list do it,"he said. "Just do it. 1 had to do it.
IYy and find weaknesses. Fhe world is a big
place."
