When Hopkins and Harvard

restored movement and helped
some live longer. Nobod\ is sure it
the stem cells grew new motor
neurons or cranked out chemicals
to help damaged neurons recover.
But "we're cautiously opti
mistic," Snyder said — enough to
take the big leap of trying stem
cells in primates, the species most
genetically similar to people.
Scientists simulate Lou
Gehrig's in monkeys by killing cer
tain motor neurons in their spinal
cords, disabling the correspond
ing limbs. Snyder (alls promising
early signs that the first stem cells
then implanted are starting to
grow.
Critics sav scientists should in
stead use stem cells found in some
adult tissues like blood, avoiding
the embryo controversy.
Numerous scientists are testing
adult stem cells, but even thev cau
tion that these older, more
evolved stem cells may not be .is
flexible so its too soon to abandon
any approach.
"Our job is to get the biology
done," Snyder said. "It we do our
job correctly, the story will be so
compelling the government and
the population will see this is bio
logically effective . . . and .1 lot of
the ethical issues will simply go
away. We're not going to have to
keep going back and getting new
embrvos or fetuses."
