horsepower. A carbon-fiber
chassis keeps the car stiff with
out sacrificing it's agility and
lightweight frame. Porsche will
produce 500 annually starting
in 2003. Projected cost: about
$300,000.

For those looking to step up
their virtual sex life, Australian
scientists Dominic Cho\ is in the
process of creating a life-sized
sex doll, complete with imita
tion skin, that is fully controlled
over a computer system. I sing
signals from the Internet, as well
as sound and touch sensors, the
apparatus would allow a user
wearing a virtual realitv headset
to have virtual sex with someone
in another part of the world also
online or with a person of the
user's imagination, such as a
celebrity, the patent back
grounder suggests. The doll it
self will be essentially passive,
but certain kev body parts
would be motor driven, the
patent says.

Want to check your e-mail
from your class but a Unix ter
minal is not within reach? Fujit

the user's I'C 1 and allows them to
perform some basic functions,
such as controlling the CD drive
and Web browser. A screen on
the device also allows users to
download and store e-mail and
news from the computer. The
lack of a keyboard on current
models means that e-mail
replies cannot be written, how
ever. and the screen might make
e-mail a little difficult to read.
The i-Point is supplied with a
single model in Fujitsu's new
high-end NF-series of Biblio
notebooks. Scheduled to ship in
mid-Februarv in Japan, the ma
