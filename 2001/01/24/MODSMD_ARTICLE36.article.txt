# Deadly drugs: The super-aspirin story

### 
BOS I ON (AP) — Super-aspirin is turning
out to be a super-failure, perhaps even a dead
ly one.
Five years ago, when large-scale (eating
began, researchers were optimistic that the
drug would improve on the plain two-cent va
riety, which is still the most important medicine
for heart disease.
But study after study has ended badl\ —
even shockingly. Now some believe the phar
maceutical industry should call it quits. Stop the
testing, they say, because super-aspirin may ac
tually kill more volunteers than it saves.
I he drugs are a class of blood thinners
known tec hnicallv as 1 lb/I 1 la antagonists. 1 he\
are already injected to keep blood vessels flow
ing smoothly after angioplasties and mild heart
attacks. But drug companies envisioned a larg
er market for these medicines in a new pill
form.
1 hey would be taken by millions of peo pie
with bad hearts to ward off heart attacks,
strokes ami death. | list like aspirin, the think
ing went, only more effective, and of course, a
lot more expensive.
l he companies have spent hundreds of mil
lions to prove super-aspirin works as well in
practice as it ought to in theory. About 42,500
volunteers have tested four slightly different
kinds in five large studies.
Kach time, though, the outcome was the
same. Super-aspirin not onlv fails to prevent
heart attacks; it actually kills people.
Knough, says Dr. Eric Topol, cardiology
chief at the ( leveland (-linic. I fe figures that in
those five studies — two of which he directed
between 150 and 200 volunteers probably died
from the treatment itself.
Nevertheless, the testing continues. A studv
of DuPont Pharmaceutical's super-aspirin,
(ailed roxitiban, began last July. It will enroll
2,200 patients in North America and Kurope In
the end of this year.
Should l)uPont let the study goon? Is it even
ethical to do so? fop-tier cardiologists argue
both sides.
Some agree with I opol. (lonsidering the i e
sults so far, these drugs are too dangerous to
keep testing on people. Others contend the
study's risks will be slight it it is stopped at the
first hint of trouble. Furthermore, there are
reasons to think roxitiban will work better than
the other super-aspirins, they say, and it would
be tragic to give up on a treatment that could
still prove to be a life saver.
An effective super-aspirin could certainly be

that. As good as aspirin is, it reduces the risk of
death from heart disease bv onl\ about 20 pet
cent, and doctors vearn tor something more
powerful.
But doubts that super-aspirin will ever be
the answer have grown over the past two years,
fhe latest setback came shortly before Christ
mas. A committee of doctors held its quarterly
meeting .it a Boston hotel to go ovei data 112 rom
BRAVO, .i big studv of a super-aspirin called
lotrafiban.
flic study was massive, involving 9,200 pa
tients on font continents. In the mathematicsof
heart research, such large numbers are neces
sary to reveal small effects of the drug.
On that December day, the numbers
showed that the death rate was actually higher
among the volunteers getting lotrafiban — 2.7
percent, versus 2 percent in the people taking
dunum pills. 1 his amounted to SO extra deaths
among the lotrafiban users — MO deaths that
may have been caused In the drug itself.
But was the drug truly to blame? ('.onunittee
members wondered. Those extra deaths might
have happened by chance. |ust two weeks ear
lier, the number of deaths in the two groups
was the same. Mavbe in time the numbers
would go the other wav.

But this was not the first time through. It was

BOS I ON (AP) — Super-aspirin is turning
out to be a super-failure, perhaps even a dead

Five years ago, when large-scale (eating
began, researchers were optimistic that the
drug would improve on the plain two-cent va
riety, which is still the most important medicine
for heart disease.
But study after study has ended badl\ —
even shockingly. Now some believe the phar
maceutical industry should call it quits. Stop the
testing, they say, because super-aspirin may ac
tually kill more volunteers than it saves.
I he drugs are a class of blood thinners
known tec hnicallv as 1 lb/I 1 la antagonists. 1 he\
are already injected to keep blood vessels flow

form.

lions to prove super-aspirin works as well in
practice as it ought to in theory. About 42,500
volunteers have tested four slightly different
kinds in five large studies.
Kach time, though, the outcome was the
same. Super-aspirin not onlv fails to prevent
heart attacks; it actually kills people.

Nevertheless, the testing continues. A studv
of DuPont Pharmaceutical's super-aspirin,
(ailed roxitiban, began last July. It will enroll
2,200 patients in North America and Kurope In
the end of this year.
Should l)uPont let the study goon? Is it even
ethical to do so? fop-tier cardiologists argue
both sides.
Some agree with I opol. (lonsidering the i e

keep testing on people. Others contend the
study's risks will be slight it it is stopped at the
first hint of trouble. Furthermore, there are
reasons to think roxitiban will work better than
the other super-aspirins, they say, and it would
be tragic to give up on a treatment that could
still prove to be a life saver.
