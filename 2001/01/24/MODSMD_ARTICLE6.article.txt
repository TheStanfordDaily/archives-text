### TRISTAN IVORY 
Almost anyone who lias spent some time on Stan
ford's campus h.is seen those brightly colored fliers
asking for research stu<l\ part it ipants. Hut how much
do vou reall\ know about paid research on campus?
You're pi c)bably familiar with the stock image of the
professional human guinea pig who will sell his or her
body to st ience just to make .1 <jiiic k buck.
In reality, most of the research conducted is social 111
nature. I he I )epartmcnt of Psychology and the (- rad
ii. ite S< lioolot lousiness run several studies throughout
the year and are always in need of'subjects.
I'he (iSli is wot king on projects about judgment
.uul interpersonal relations, and the Psychology De
partment is conducting studies looking .11 shyness,
emotional contrc>l. Intel net behavior, < onipetition and
personality.
Research isn't only for the tnonetarih challenged.
"Some people ask to participate |iist to see what hap
pens," explained 1.1 Inula Virav, human subject coor
dinator for the Psvc holog\ Department. "( I he pai 111 i
pants] just want to learn more about themselves."
I hat said, none of the participants seem tcÂ» com
plain about the pay. Most studies pay approximated
$10 per half hour of work, which is nearly four limes
minimum wage. Keep in mind, however, that some
departments enforce pay ceilings as an incentive to
keep the applicant pool evenly distributed for re
scan hers whose budgets might not be so generous.
Also, some studies mav have marked drawbacks.
"I passed on the opportunity to have a thin tube
placed into niv nose and down through niv lungs, de
spite the vet \ high price tag .... I he risks seemed too
great." junior Michael Sego said.
"I remember being like-, 'what are they doing?' and
being reallv bored for the most part, recalled senior
Rvan \loore, who did participate in that experiment.
Most panic ipants questioned agree that the prima
ry focus should be on the- quality of the experiment,
rather than how nine hit pavs.
Most studies take anywhere from 'M) minutes to an
hour, although it is not unusual for studies to monitor
students' dail\ activities over the course of several
days.
"[These studies are] how we get our data." Virav
s.iid. ' 1 he researc hers base their results from the an
swers given by the subjects." She also mentioned that
results from most studies are often published 111 pre
eminent research journals.
