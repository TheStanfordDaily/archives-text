()n Jan. 2">, 19'i9, Ihe Daily ran an arti
i It- < ailed "Frankenstein Comes Back; Frosh
Quake."
"At 10:30 o'clock Monday nigln Kiuina
et hoed and rc-ec hoed streams as enthusias
tic listeners to the De\ il's Scrapbook' pro
gram turned oil their radios and let loose
pent-up nervous emotion with many horri
ble \ .n ieties ol screams.
"At 11:30 o'clock, (any) three sleeping
students (reading Barnes, History ol West
ern Civilization) were aroused from their
lethargy by a slow, deliberate knock on the
door. One of them ambled over, poked his
head out, muttered, 'Oh, my God!' and
backed unsteadily into the room. The other
two looked up. There were hoarse crackling
noises and a gulp, as three scalps stood up
and tingled with terror. Lumbering into the
room with expertly spaced, low growls,
came a wonderful horrible Frankenstein.
Then from the hall came loud rolls of
laughter. The three now unsleepy students
gi inned sheepishly and joined he (rowd tbl
lowing Frankenstein Bud Ames on his tour
of Encina."
Bottom line: Frosh beware. If you fall asleep dur
ing I-Hum reading, Frankenstein is going to get
you. Oooooooh . . .
