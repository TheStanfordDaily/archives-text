The Ecuadorean tanker, Jessica, barely remains afloat Tuesday near San Cristobal in the Galapagos Island chain.
The tanker, carrying 243,000 gallons of diesel fuel, ran aground last Tuesday in the pounding surf off the island.
More than 1 70,000 gallons of the fuel have leaked into the waters off the Galapagos Islands, threatening one of the
world's unique ecosystems.
