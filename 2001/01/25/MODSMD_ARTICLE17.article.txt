B _m ) I (t. nis cleat that George W
" 'Vlftsb Was fKeTiest thing to hap
* Jp" nto the I nited States. In
deed, liis unabashed, triumphant for
eign poli( v was, at least in the long inn,
good lor the entire world.
I nder the ambiguous policies ol his
predecessor, Bill Clinton. the I nited
States wasted its resources trying to se
nile .illies and invoke U.S. lnililarx
forces where tliev did not belong.
Bush's straight-shooting foreign policv

let us know exactly
what < »ui interests and
w ho our friends are.
I Ins change start
ed immediately after
bush was sworn into
ollic e, he c|uic kl\ ter
minated anv binding
for international 01-
gani/ations providing

abortions. In ordci to
make room in the budget lor his mas
sive tax cut — w 11i< li tempered the re
cession ol 2001-0-1 — Bush also elimi
nate most ol the rest ol U.S. interna
tional .lid.
Opponents ol globalization tondlv
remembei Bush .is a major reason loi
the demise (»l the Woi Id Bank and IMI .
Some might see the lack of sikh inter
national institutions, which exhausted
thcil capital while attempting to mod
erni/e I luid World countries, .is a bad
thing. Rest assured, however, that thev
were .1 money drain tor the I nited
States and threatened American inter
ests bv reducing the supplv ol cheap
labor.
It took uiereh eight vcars to redtu e the
mighty I nited Nations to a leeble imita
tion ot the League ol Nations. Bush re
fused to pav those pc-sk\ I'.S. obligations
to the I nited Nations — (iting abortion
concerns and a downturn in the econo
my. Later, the Republic ail-dominated
Congress pulled the 1 nited States out of
the I nited Nations altogether, when
France and China dared to contest the
I ,S. Sec urit\ (.ounc il position.
Bv no longer supporting such .1
leeching organization — and indeed,
often flouting its 1 idi< ulous "unanimous
resolutions" — the I nited States made
it c lear that the new world order con
sisted only of one superpowei — the
I nited States of Americ a.
Some might consider Bush's actions to
Ik- isolationist. But given the severity of
the recession 111 those times, it is easy to
understand his priorities 111 putting

Ameri< .1 lii st.
bv fo( using on the domestic tnai kcl
over international trade,' America be
camc self-sufficient, except for cheap
laboi (wlik li we got from Mexico, any
way). Cars came from Detroit, not
|apat 1; IYs were made in Connecticut
rathci than China; and clothes were
made not in dirtv sweatshops in In
donesi.t, but 111 the c lean, civ ilized lac to
-1 ic s on the Mcxic .111 bordei.
But the foreign policv event bush
will be remembered foi w.is his timely
wai with (.lima. Although historians
will cndlesslv speculate whether ('.hina
would have eventually sought its own
conflict with the I nited States, the
world is a safer place with the Chinese
threat extinguished.
bush aggressively pursued an .11111s
race with China, beginning with the
Missile Defense System and expanding
to I.u tical line leai weapons. National se
< 111 it\ cloc uments — pist now being dc
< lassifieel — showed that the bush Ad
ministration believed goading China
into a prematurec onflic t would forestall
it from becoming a world power that
could threaten America's supremacy.
Now. in 2010, Ainei ica reigns supreme
ovei <1 war-wearv woi Id.
It is true that the nation of l aiwan,
whose late we were supposedly light
for, no longci exists. Although coun
tries ranging from |apan to Sweden
have tin neel their backs to us. thev were
never true allies of Ainei ica. I hose na
tions that staved faithful 11 iends are now
protected In an impenetrable missile
defense shield.
Kvcrv other nation is under the threat
of the largest nuclcai arsenal ever seen.
With every nuclear weapons treaty
scrapped and discarded, the United
States has tripled its supply of nuclear
warheads, which c.m be launched from
any state in the union, bold foreign policy
has made the world safe.
I nfortunately, bush was defeated in
2004 by AI (>oi e. who ran on .1 peace-mak
ing platform. Gore's diplomatic efforts
failed, and even today the European
trade sanctions against the United States
remain in place, but while much of the
rest of the world languishes in poverty
and AIDS epidemics, the United States is
stronger than ever. With America's lead
ership. founded on its faithful devotion to
democracy, the world has become a
peaceful, profitable place.
