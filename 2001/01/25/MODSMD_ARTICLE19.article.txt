De Klerk's South Africa record demands
a critical outlook toward his speech
Hie ASM Speakers Bureau has invit
ed former South African president F.W.
de Klerk to speak at Stanford I'niversity
on |an 29, S p.m., «»t Kresge Auditorium.
F.W. de Klerk is currently on a tour to
promote his autobiography "The l ast
lick: A New Beginning." In this book, de
Klerk portrays himself as a benevolent
leader who was instrument.il in ending
apartheid and ushering in a new demo
cratic regime.
Concerned members of the Stanford
community strongly feel th.it this is a bla
tant distortion of history. De Klerk has
re-delegated authority, but be should
not be allowed to re-delegate responsi
bility. Institutions such as rhe Truth and
Reconciliation Commission and
Amnesty International have critici/cd
F.W. de Klerk for his involvement in
human rights violations during the
apartheid regime and even after the re
lease of Nelson Mandela.
We urge the Stanford community to
look beyond the Nobel peace pri/c facade
and to thoroughly inform itself about bis
controversial human rights record before
attending the event.
If you are moved by what you learn,
join us in a silent act of protest against de
Klerk by standing up and turning your
back when he is applauded at the end of
his speech.

Consider the following facts that will
certainly not appear in de Klerk's speech
on |an 29th:
1) IV Klerk was a member of the Na
tional I'artv for 17 years, a party that lias
been responsible for some of the tnost
unspeakable human lights abuses of the
20th century. To this day, F.W. de Klerk
.itid the National I'artv have not admit
ted that apartheid was a crime against
humanity.
2) I here were more political killings
during the four years of bis administration
than in the entire decade of the 1980s.
l\) It lias been proven bevond a doubt
that most of the violent clashes between
the Inkatha Freedom Party and the
Ati ican National (longress (as well as other
anti-apartheid activists) were statc-spon
sored.
I) De Klerk lied about the existence of
the Steyn Report when he testified to the
I R(. that the Report was brought to bis at
tention in an oral manner only. The truth
is that a written report exists and that the
report proves the covert atrocities com
mitted bv the security forces. 1 he commit
tee repeatedly condemned de Klerk for
his attempts to cover up the involvement
of the security forces. I he Steyn Report
was never released by de Klerk.
5) In 1995, evidence was pnxluced that
a division of the State Security Council was
engaged in a covert campaign to under
mine the ANC at the negotiating table.
De Klerk continues to insist that he

knew nothing about the covert operations
tli.it were confirmed In two cabinet com
mittees (which he chaired); he knew noth
ing about the death squads ih.it operated
from \ lakplaas (although its commandet
puhli( l\ (onfessed in 1988); he knew noth
ing about the bio-chemical warfare pro
grams aimed .it FRKI.IMO troops in
Mozambique (although its director was
charged with murder); he knew nothing
about the documented poli( e involvement
in the Boipatong massacre (1992); he
knew nothing about the fact that much of
the so-called black-on-black violence was
sponsored and instigated bv Ins state; he
knew nothing about the torture commit
ted by individuals directly under his au
thority.
We want to be clear that we are not
< hallenging de Klerk's freedom of speech.
However, allowing him to leave Stanford
University unchallenged would be an in
sult to the masses of people that struggled
to bring apartheid to an end.
