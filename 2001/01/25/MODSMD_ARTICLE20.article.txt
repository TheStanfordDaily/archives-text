## De Klerk speech provides a valuable learning experience 
### CHRIS MALONEY GUEST COLUMNIST 
In .1 speech In- gave in 199S at Hamilton
C.ollege. lA\. (It - Klerk said, "How do
you met <>li I he ba< k of .1 tigei without linn
turning arouiul and eating you!'" Foi the
white leadei s of S< >11111 All it.i n National l\n i\

South Afrit a remainetl, and (ontinues as, one
of the most Yibrant pl.u es on 1 arth for all peo
ple involved. wheihei blat k, coloured, indian
or white. As a nation. South Africa has sur
vived. and it survived on its own terms. ('.otne
lieai one of the leaders who was part of this.

Furthermore, the painful and deeplv an
gering past of South Africa was not the re
sponsibility of one man, but rathei resulted
from main actions of different groups and
people that spanned 1 eiitin ies. I he 1111 redihle
transition of power, which did not result in a
ia< iai bloodbath as mam presupposed, was el
feited b\ several leaders, partitul.irh Nelson
Mandela and FAV.de Klerk.
Fo sa\ Mr. de Klerk s role in ending
apartheid is "overstated" is itself an egregious
exaggeration. One cannot den\ the events of
Feb. 2.1 W(), w here in one sitting he basit all\ 1 e
peali'd the basis ol apartheid In freeing Nelson
Mandela and legalizing banned parties like the
\\(.. therein setting the stage lot inajorit\ rule.
Featlers, like each of us, are not statu figures.
Indeed, the de Klerk of Botha's cabinet in the
I ( .)70s .ind KOs and the de Klei k we will meet < >11
Mondav are veiv different 111 mam respects.
In no wa\ am I asserting that he should not
be held accountable (01 his influential role in
the National l*art\ s i.uist, repressive and vio
lent actions and policies during what were ai

guahh I lie- harshest wars of apartheid. I am,
however, saving thai we should tr\ to under
stand full\ de Klerk the man before coin hid
ing anything else. I do not think de Klerk
gave ovei power graciousU [to Mandelal" in
the tiisi place, but that is win we tall it a transi
tion to democracy. l)emt>crac\ is not always
gracious; it is an exercise o! choice. Foi acting
to make that choice possible in South Africa,
de Klci k deserves remembei ant e.
I also <|iiest ion the (let ision til if it.tin mem
bers ofoui communit\ who have deemed it
appropriate to wear blat k. stand up and turn
then b.it ks during the applause alter the t.ilk.
What is such protest, which will look superfi
t ialh .is .11 ather tlippant idealistic at tion, sup
posed to accomplish? Do we have the hubris to
tlnnk th.it aftei .ill that has happened, we alone
t .in make de Kit 1 k all ot a sudden deal with his
past in the wa\ we want him to?
Do we honestK think he has never consid
ered dealing with Ins past before? Koi this rea
son. I applaud constructive critii ism, dialogue,
accountabilit\ t|iiestions and dissenuninating

oilier viewpoints to members of our commu
nity, But the disrespect described in vester
da\ s article seems to me counterpi ■ Kluctive in
that it will furtlier confuse our conununilv.
Further, his autobiogiapln is biased b\ its
very nature, for it is an autobiography. "Misin

once said, whenever an author has to select
what to include and not include m Ins 01 her

I exhort everyone who t an to go see a man
who was a major plaver in the 400-veai liiston
ot a nation that is just now mining on, and
moving on at an astounding rate. I am not sa\-
