### SAMEER AHMED EDITORIAL STAFF 
I Ik* No. 1 Stanford men's basket
ball te .1111 is looking to make history
tonight when it t.ikes on Washington
at 7:80 p.m. in Seattle.
If the Cardinal (17-0, 5-0 Pacific
10 Conference) defeats the Huskies
(8-10, 2-4 l'ac-10), the team will tie
the school record for its best st.irt.
which it set in the 1997-98 season.
I hat \ear. Stanford finished the sea
son 30-5 and made it to the Final
Four.
Washington should not pose a
problem for the top team in the na
tion. 1 he Huskies have defeated a
No. 1 team onlv once in 25 attempts,
a 09-08 over I CIA in 1979. I lie
Cardinal has also won the last six
meetings with Washington, its
longest winning streak in.i series that
began in 1910.
Washington is coming off a split
on its road trip to Oregon List week.
()n M( Art In u (iourt, the 11 uskies de
feated ()regon, 72-71. in overtime on
Jan. 18. 112 wo days later, they lost 63-
56 to ()regon State.
"1 expect a very competitive
game," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. Washington
head coach Bob Bender "does a great
job, he always lias. 1 le runs good mo
tion; lie's going to spread the court
out a little bit."
1 lie I fuskies are led In senior for
ward Will Pel kins, who leads the l'ac
-10 with seven double-doubles in the
17 games he lias played. Perkins
leads Washington with I 1.1 points
and 7.0 rebounds per game.
Perkins's strong inside plav is
complemented In two highly-touted

freshmen, athletic guards Curtis
Allen and C.J. Massingale. Massin
gale ranks second on the team in
si < >ring in conference games, avei ag
ing 10.2 points per outing while
shooting 53 percent from three
point range.
Stanford is coming oft a 75-4-1 vic
tor\ over the speech New Mexico
I.oboson Saturday. With swinginen
Case\ |acobsen and Rvan Mende/
knocking down 3-pointers and the
Collins twins dominating down low,
the (lardinal lias been pla\ ing its best
basketball of the season. I oi omplete
the starting lineup, point guard
Michael McDonald lias performed
consistentl\ all season, posting an im
pulsive 89 to 23 assist-to-turnover
ratio.
While the C ardin.il lias the si/e
and talent to beat the Huskies, us
major test will be getting the plavcrs
mentally prepared for an awav game.
I onight's contest will be the first road
game lor Stanford suu e it rose to the
No. 1 spot three weeks ago.
Although the Stanford plavers
may be undei pressure t<>remain the
only undefeated team in Division I
men's basketball, Montgomen does
not think that the extra attention will
be a problem.
"It [the Cardinal plavers] will hail
back to past experiences on the
Washington trip â€” hem difficult it
was tow in, how great we lelt when we
got out with a win and how lough it
was. 1 think that's all tliev need as a
reminder," Montgomen said.
"I think the other thing is just
going on the road in league, the un
dei standing that its just more difli
c ult, and vou have to do things better,
you have to be ready to plav."
