I lit- Stanford women's basket
ball team knows there is no place
like home. Despite the ( at (final's
mediocre (S-7, 2-3 Pacific 10
(Conference) record, Stanford has
onl\ one loss at Maples Pavilion.
Washington and Washington
State will test the (Ordinal's home
prowess this weekend when tliev
travel to Maples for two kev con
ference matchups.
Stanford is coming off its first
road vidorv of the season over
crosstown rival California. While
the Cardinal should have easily
blown past the Bears. Cal guards
Conrtnev |ohnson and Kenya
Corlev made things difficult tor
Stanford, and the game was tight
up until the final minute.
"If we want to have any
eh.nice of being in this race, you
can't be dropping games and
vou have to control vour home
floor," said head coach l ata
\ anDei veer. "We know we are
plaving with our backs against
the wall and we're just going to
trv to build on the victory at Cal
and just keep working hard.
1 hat game could have gone ei
ther wav. and we know that."
While Cal's |ohnson and Cor
lev are talented, Stanford will
have to face arguably the Pac-10's
best lineup of guards in the trio of
senior Megan I i an/a. sopho
more loree Pavne and freshman
Ciuliana Mendiola in tonight's
matc hup against the Huskies.
"What I really like about
Washington is their guard play,"
said head coach 1 ara \ an-
Dei veer. "The\ are playing really
well and tliev compliment each
other. Your inside kids can really
get things going if vou have that
t\ pe of perimeter play."
Fran/.a and Pavne were third
and fourth, respectively, in Pac
-10 scoring last vear and are the
top returning scorers this season.
Fran/a has been steady .ill season

and is a huge threat from bevoncl
the arc. After sitting out the open
ing weeks of the season with a
stress fracture, Payne is back in
full force and has lit up the- khi
terence scoreboard.
Meanwhile, the newcomer
Mendiola has been contributing
in all aspects of the game. In ad

(lition to a superb shooting tone li,
the freshman has led the team in
rebounding on several ot casious.

Freshman point guard Nicole
I'owcll is getting better cat h week
as she adjusts to the position. If
she can continue lo step up her
hall control and distribution, the
(Cardinal should do well this
weekend.
"1 think Nicole's really doing a
good job for us," said Van-
Dei veer. "Plaving out of position
is onl\ going to make her better.
She is extremely competitive and
is leading our team in scoring and
rebounding."

efit the Cardinal after its disas

IU grabbing two wins this week
end and starting to win on the
road, the Cardinal might still
have the opportunity to salvage
its season.
"You have to be ready to play
every night and it makes it a
race, it helps our situation if we
can take advantage of it. said
VanDerveer. "You have to go
out and plav well every night,
.md you can't overlook every
one. obviously we're not in a pos

Washington head coach |une

gerous Stanford can be.
"Fara VanDerveer is there,
.uid she is one of the best coat li
es in the country," said Daugh
ertv. " I hem playing at home,
they arc going to be ready. They
arc the biggest team in the con
ference and bring a lot of
weapons on the bench. Thcv
have had to make some changes
but they are starting to respond,
and they are a dangerous team
because of that."

"Fara VanDerveer is there,

they arc going to be ready. They
arc the biggest team in the con

weapons on the bench. Thcv
have had to make some changes
but they are starting to respond,
and they are a dangerous team
because of that."
