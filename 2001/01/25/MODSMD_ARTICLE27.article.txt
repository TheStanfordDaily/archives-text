Senior Alex Kim will anchor the Cardinal this season. Kim, the 1999 NCAA singles champion,
will compete with junior K.J Kippensteel, the NCAA doubles champion, for the No 1 spot
year for [Cardoso and Kao]," said
(iould.
()n the doubles side, Could
hopes ih.it bv combining Kim and
Hippensteel for the fiisi time, lie
can ensure strong doubles play for
the* (Cardinal.
"II |Kim and Hippensteel] can
do a good job at for us, that would
be a tremendous plus fen us," said
Could. "(Scott and Ans.iii| had a
great record at No. doubles [last
year] and sometimes at No. 2, so
the\ will pla\ No. 2 or No. .'i dou
bles right now. They earned it by
winning the Sherwood ('.lassie (last
weekend]."
Fot the othei spot, Martin and
l.ipskv have been pla\mg well to
gether, but Morris and llaviland
have also recently shown impres
sive play.
Fxamining the lineup o! tins
veal's team, Could and assistant
( o.h h |ohn Whitlinger are vcr\ ex
(ited fin Ihe season.

" The team has a great feeling*
Could said. "Most ot them wen
here when we were beaten in the
quarterfinals In Baylor two years
ago, and even more were here
when we won it List year. I hey
know the difference between the
disappointment of losing and the
jov of winning and I think they
[understand] what it takes to pre
pare themselves tor the [NCAA.
(Championships]."
"We are really excited about
this season," Could said. "The im
provement of the guys over the
summer from last vear has been
phenomenal and the lineup
should be good from top to bot
tom. We don't know much about
the other teams, but we know that
our team will be tough to beat."
I ven with the added difficulty
of repeating last year's champi
onship season, the team looks for
ward to the c hallenge.
"It's .1 tough spot beingthe team
th.it everyone is gunning for. but
we welcome it," said Martin. "I love
teams trying to beat us as badly .is
tlie\ can, because the quality of
tennis and the level of intensity

both rise. It keeps us on guard."
The top c hallengers for the title
include perennial powers UCLA,
Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi
and Mississippi State. Along with
UCIA and Fresno State, USC will
prove to be tough competition in
Pat-10 play.
"It will be a great year tor col
lege- tennis. All [of the teams] are
very even," Could said. "The edge
will go to tlie team that is a little bit
luckier, health-wise, towards the
end of the year."
The team will play its first Pac
-10 dual match of the season at Ore
gon tomorrow, followed by .moth
er road mate li against \\ ashington
the following day. Its first home
match will be a very pivotal one
against Fresno State on Feb. 9.
