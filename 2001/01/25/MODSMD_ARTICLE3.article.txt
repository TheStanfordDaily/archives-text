attempt to mobilize against it.
I he third type of violence best describes the

ple of Chiapas in the larger global order, em
phasizing that ('.hiapas is one of main regions
that has been denied access to the world's
wealth and power structure.
"Poverty is a product of dominant, ex
ploitative governments and the current glob
al economic system," Rui/ said. "Some people
sav that this is the onlv and final system; thev

say that all others have been tried, 112 hese peo
ple must promote the free market so tliev can
save themselves economically. For them,
there is no salvation outside the free market
svstem."
Rui/ affirms the injustices of the present da\
economic order.
"Not everyone can benefit," Rui/ said.
"Some people aren't just p< >or but excluded en
tirely from the concentration of wealth. Some

"The destruction of the world is a real mat
ter," Rui/ said. "The globalization of capital,
