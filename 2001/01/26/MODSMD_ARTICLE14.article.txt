Mike Montgomery doesn't expeet
perfection from any basketball team.
In fact, he doesn't even think it's possi
ble for Stanford to maintain its unde
feated roll all the way into April.
On the other hand, Montgomery
doesn't expect his players to lose just
because they haven't lost. . .
'!At some point, someone's going to
come along and play better and we're
going to lose," Montgomery said. "Of
course we'd like to win every game;
that's always the goal''. . .
A perfect season is not often dis
cussed at Stanford, even though the
Cardinal still have a shot at what is
perhaps college basketball's most diffi
cult achievement.
"The main goal is that we'd like to
go undefeated in our third season (the
NCAA Tournament), but that's a long
ways off" Montgomery said.
