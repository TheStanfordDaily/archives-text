M( )N( )RAI L. Although the con
< ept sounds fantastic, like
something out ola cartoon sit
com or sci-fi film, a group ol
Palo Alto <iti/cns with Stanford connec
tions w ho e .ill themselves (',ities l 2 are work
ing to implement I his project. In the name
ol alleviating the horrific ti a (lie congestion
th.it plagues the Ba\ Area, the county
should consider this proposal .is a viable
possibility.
Silic on Valley employees lac e an average
commute of 90 minutes. C.urrenl mass
transit opt ions sue h as (l.ilt rain are pre)ving
slow as well .is inconvenient, and.i revolu
tion;! r\ new transportation system could be
just what the county ordered. I he mono
rail would operate in ae eordance with sev-

eral kev transportation realities and needs
of Bay Area commuters.
I lie foremost concern ol most public
works planners is cost. The monorail is sur
prisingly cheaper than most conventional
transit options. At $10 million pei mile,
monorail would be less expensive to con
struct than a comparable length of Ireewav,
traditional ground rail or subway.
I lie monorail is well suited to tliec rowel
eel Bay Area. At lb fee-t off the ground, its
considerable space efficiency makes it an
espee iallv suitable transit system for liiglih
developed Silicon Valley. The s\stein also
has the* advantage of being much quieter
than trains or < ar traffle .
Speed is anotliei advantage. I he mono
rail would get people to theii destinations

faster (hail is presentl\ possible during the
morning and evening commute. Indeed,
the monorail s estimated speed, \\hi<li
ranges from !i0 to SO mph, certainh out
strips rush hour 011 I lighwa\ 101 and puts
(lie ('.altrain to shame.
linallv, il tlie golden rule of transporta
tion is that people love then cars, the
monorail has a better chance of luring
drivers off the roads than .1 conventional
train, li seems that people prefer driving
not for its own sake but rathei bc< a use the\
like having their own space. 11eiuc the op
position to public transportation. As con
ceived, however, the monorail would have
individual cabs for 110 more than three pas
sengers who would be able to select one of
many stations .it whit h to be (hopped oil.

Like am major investment using public
funds, i Ik- monorail initiative merits critical
cost-benefit analvsis along with market re
search to determine it Bay Area citizens
would take advantage of sue ha transit sys
tem. Provided the service is affordable,
( ommuters should find the system appeal
ing. Ihe monorail as imagined and de
signed In the (lit ies2 group has «i number
o! pi agmatic features tli.it work to solve the
particular components of the Bay Area
traffic mess.
At the ver\ least, policy-makers and
urban planners should take the monorail
into serious consideration. Who knows, the
monorail might end up being the wave of
the future. Just ask any visitor to Walt Dis
nev Woi Id.
