I n see this, we need
ouh look at four fa-

the Rev. |esse |.ickson, and two Di'ino

something like this, in descending < >1 del:

I think that ordering is |>rett\ solid.
I- vet vone loves King. And the onl\ con
servatives who still hear ill will toward
11 K have their cowlxn li.its screwed on
too light. Hill ('.linton is despised h\ .i

nine months in mommy's tiinimv. Jesse

It looks .is it the single most important
thing von can do for voni Icgacv, if von
pi.in on committing adiiltery. is to get
killed before vonr sins become public
knowledge. Ihinkofvoin life as a narra
tive. .i storv. You've got the rising action,
the climax, the falling action, the epi
logue. then vou're dead and it's finished.
People start forming an impression
about the meaning of vonr life, what
kind of person von were.
King and |I K both died before the

mere footnote that it is foil K and King.
|esse |at kson is 0111\ a ( 011 pie ol tlavs

lus reputation is vet to he tletet mined. I

bill Clinton's greatest asset is the lac t
that he was aggressiveK attacked In his
opponents for King about lus adultcrv.
I he sordid details ol lus relationship
with Monica were released to the entire
world. He was impeached. He was put
through hell, and he c ame out alive. 111 a
sense, he has proved lus worth. Or, at
least, Ins supporters consider Ins adul
tcrv as more ola tool for lus opponents
than a sin. What was weak-willed indis
cretion became a show of Ins strength
of will.
I've heard <1 lot of people sa\ that |cssc
|ac kson should be left alone. Perhaps the
media should hack ofl and let him have
time with lus family, let Ins wife throw
licavv things at lus head. Hut that would
be the worst thing for him. in the
long run.
He needs to get slammed, 1 he Chris
ti.m C.oalition should organize marches
and demonstrations outside his house.
Pro-tamilv groups should burn him 111
effigv. Longtime political allies should
distance themselves from him.
I hen, slowly hut surely, he must work
Ins way back into the picture. Transfig
