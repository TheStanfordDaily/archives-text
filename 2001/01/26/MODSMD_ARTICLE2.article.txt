### JEFF TAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a meeting List quarter
with undergraduates who are par
ents, the I'niversitv began dis
cussing a half-do/en programs
.md changes to address concerns
in child care, financial aid and so
cial and ac adeinic support.
After meeting with members of
the ASSU, Provost John
Ftchemench gathered a group of
administrators to address the
issues.
"We tried to address .ill their
problems," Ktc hemencK said. 1 he
()f 1 ice ol Student Aflaii s has since
conic- up with a series of solutions
to some of the problems, includ
ing financial aid.
Vice I'rovost for Student Af
fairs. |ames Montova, taking the
lead 011 this issue, said that the ()l
fice of Admissions and Financial
Aid will be re-evaluating financial
packages for undergraduate par
ents to account for their special
status.
"When we admit students,
we're verv proud we have need
blind admissions." Ftchemendv
said. "Some students come with
spec ial needs." He said that Stan
ford "does what it c an to enable
students to benefit from what the
I nivci sit\ has to offer."
Some of the other immediate
short-term solutions include: c re
ating a list of all undergraduate
parents at Stanford that will allow
fot better communication be
tween tlicin and ci eating a "dot m
affiliate" program in which par
ents will have tlu- opportunit\ to
be linked with a dorniitorv, be put
on the dorinitorv's e-mail list and
have access to the support stall

that the donniton provides.
In the long run, the goal will be
to create a "neighborhood" of un
dergraduate parents in Fscondi
do Village so that thev will be less
socialk is< dated and will have then
own support mechanisms.
Hut Montova emphasized,
" l lie 'neighborhood' concept will
take several quarters to imple
ment as it is dependent on vac .ni
cies developing in FA'.
