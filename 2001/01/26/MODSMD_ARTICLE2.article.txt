### JEFF TAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a meeting List quarter
with undergraduates who are par
ents, the I'niversitv began dis
cussing a half-do/en programs
.md changes to address concerns
in child care, financial aid and so
cial and ac adeinic support.
After meeting with members of
the ASSU, Provost John
Ftchemench gathered a group of
administrators to address the
issues.
"We tried to address .ill their
problems," Ktc hemencK said. 1 he
()f 1 ice ol Student Aflaii s has since
conic- up with a series of solutions
to some of the problems, includ
ing financial aid.
Vice I'rovost for Student Af
fairs. |ames Montova, taking the
lead 011 this issue, said that the ()l
fice of Admissions and Financial
Aid will be re-evaluating financial
packages for undergraduate par
ents to account for their special
status.
"When we admit students,
we're verv proud we have need
blind admissions." Ftchemendv
said. "Some students come with
spec ial needs." He said that Stan
ford "does what it c an to enable
students to benefit from what the
I nivci sit\ has to offer."
Some of the other immediate
short-term solutions include: c re
ating a list of all undergraduate
parents at Stanford that will allow
fot better communication be
tween tlicin and ci eating a "dot m
affiliate" program in which par
ents will have tlu- opportunit\ to
be linked with a dorniitorv, be put
on the dorinitorv's e-mail list and
have access to the support stall

that the donniton provides.
In the long run, the goal will be
to create a "neighborhood" of un
dergraduate parents in Fscondi
do Village so that thev will be less
socialk is< dated and will have then
own support mechanisms.

Dorm-affiliate program
In the meantime, a dorm affili
ate program will be opei ational in
Februarv. Working in conjunc
tion with Residential Fclucation,
Associate 1 Jean of Students Moi i is
(.raves lias put together the de
tails of the program.
I le said that those who wish to
participate w ill eac li be assigned to
a Resident Assistant and Resident
Fellow in a four-class dormitory.
Fhev'll have the opportunity to
participate in events with the resi
dents of the donniton, and will
have dinner with residents. Ihe
program is set to be operational in
Februan.
Sophomore Lisa Prieto, an un
dergraduate parent, said she- was
excited about the program. She
said when she was a freshman, she
was involved in a siniilai program
where she was affiliated with
(lecho.
" I liev didn't exclude me, that
was nic e, 1 liked it. 1 he ('.echo stall
really made an extra effort to in
clude me," she said. She also ap
pro iated having the extra ac ade
mic support provided In dormito
lies, in the form of academic tu
tors, or e-mail reminders to tile
study lists on time.
1 o extend this program tor all
undergraduate parents, not just
freshmen, sounds go<>d to her, she
said.
"It might not he that useful, but
I'd like to he more aware of cam
pus events."
Senior Lindsay Pollak, a Resi
dent Assistant in Mirlo, said the
program "sounds like .1 good idea
and it's important to get integrat
ed with the social scene; the social
scene at Stanford starts in the
dorm."
She also said that "the person
should feel comfortable in the
dorm [and] should have meals in
the dorm two or three times ot

the week."
For the program to work. Pol
lak believes, "both sides need to
actively participate; the dorm
should not be a mere activity re
source."
Graves acknowledged that the
dorm affiliate program was a short
term solution.
"This is a beginning step. In
the long term ideallv, we'd have
programs in [Kscondido Vil
lage]," lie said.
He said that eventually, he
hoped to bring the support s\s
tems of an undergraduate dorm,
such .is Residenti.il Kducation
programs, to KY to accommodate
undergraduates living there.
Ktchemendv added, " I licv'rc
excellent solutions; we'll have to
initialh start them 111 a hapha/ard
way, but by next fall it will be
made a much more regular
process."
I'ndergraduate parents will

also have to wait fora new child
care facility will be built in Stan
ford West, an apartment complex
near campus, by next fall. Another
facility is set to open in 2002 or
200 H.
Reactions
Response to the solutions have
been mixed.
Senior and parent Rebecca
1 rotzkv-Sirr, who attended the
meeting, said that for child care,
"we probabh won't see the results
in time," and added that while "1
haven't seen a concrete plan vet,
the provost is committed to com
ing up with one."
Senior C'.liricelle McC.lond said
that as an older undergraduate
parent, having entered Stanford
.is .1 freshman in 1 9VW and stopped
out for four years, the dorm-affili
ate program might not be .is useful
to Iter .is to some of the vounger
undergraduate parents.

But overall, she said she was
glad that the administration was
taking steps to "recognize the
nature of being an undergradu
ate parent."
Newton said, "I'm really im
pressed with the urgency thev [the
administration] has put 011 the
issue [and] we're anticipating the
actual changes."
Original concerns
One of the paramount con
cerns for undergraduate parents
was inadequate childcare.
"We wanted basically to have
better daycare in an affordable
fashion," McCloud said. Current
ly, there is a two-vear waiting list to
receive daycare at Stanford.
McCloud also explained that
undergraduate parents financial
aid formulas did not account for
the extra cost of having children.
I hev also hope to build a com
munitv of undergraduate parents

in KY an a better social and acade
mic support system for under
graduate parents.
ASSI President Setli Newton,
a senior, said, "I think that thev
| undergraduate parents] face a lot
of difficulties pursuing their edu
cation. It's the responsibility of the
institution to allow them to pm sue
their education."
The meeting
I he parents first brought up
these issues with Newton, who
then brought them to the Faculty
Senate meeting on Nov. .'<o. As a
direct result of the senate meeting,
Ktchemendv, Newton, ASSI Vice
President Malia \ illegas, three
undergraduate parents, a mem
ber of Stanford Advocates for
Children and a member of the
Craduate Student Council met to
hash out these concerns.
Hie meeting, McCloud said,
was "very promising." Irot/kv-

Shi said.
"I think it was one of the first
times the provost had heard about
tins, and he was receptive," she
said, adding that "the fait that
they're to admit that there's
a dis< repaiu \ in the wav thev give
financial aid to under'graduate
parents is a big step."
Ktchemendv said, " 1 hey [the
undergraduate parents] were ex
tremeh helpful in suggesting so
lutions; it was an eve opener."
\fc( loud said that before the
meeting, it was much more diffi
cult to work with the administra
tion. 1 lie Work Life ()ffice, whit h
deals with child care for facultx
and students, hasn't reallv been
verv helpful, she said.
She explained that undergrad
uate parents had been presenting
their concerns foi quite awhile
now, and had basicallv run into a
bureaucratic wall before meeting
with Ktchemendv.

The meeting
I he parents first brought up
these issues with Newton, who
then brought them to the Faculty
Senate meeting on Nov. .'<o. As a
direct result of the senate meeting,
Ktchemendv, Newton, ASSI Vice
President Malia \ illegas, three
undergraduate parents, a mem
ber of Stanford Advocates for
Children and a member of the
Craduate Student Council met to
hash out these concerns.
Hie meeting, McCloud said,
was "very promising." Irot/kv-

Shi said.
"I think it was one of the first
times the provost had heard about
tins, and he was receptive," she
said, adding that "the fait that
they're to admit that there's
a dis< repaiu \ in the wav thev give
financial aid to under'graduate
parents is a big step."
Ktchemendv said, " 1 hey [the
undergraduate parents] were ex

lutions; it was an eve opener."
\fc( loud said that before the
meeting, it was much more diffi

verv helpful, she said.
She explained that undergrad
uate parents had been presenting
their concerns foi quite awhile
now, and had basicallv run into a
bureaucratic wall before meeting
with Ktchemendv.
After a meeting List quarter
with undergraduates who are par
ents, the I'niversitv began dis
cussing a half-do/en programs
.md changes to address concerns
in child care, financial aid and so
cial and ac adeinic support.
After meeting with members of
the ASSU, Provost John
Ftchemench gathered a group of
administrators to address the
issues.
"We tried to address .ill their
problems," Ktc hemencK said. 1 he
()f 1 ice ol Student Aflaii s has since
conic- up with a series of solutions
to some of the problems, includ
ing financial aid.
Vice I'rovost for Student Af
fairs. |ames Montova, taking the
lead 011 this issue, said that the ()l
fice of Admissions and Financial
Aid will be re-evaluating financial
packages for undergraduate par
ents to account for their special
status.
"When we admit students,
we're verv proud we have need
blind admissions." Ftchemendv
said. "Some students come with
spec ial needs." He said that Stan
ford "does what it c an to enable
students to benefit from what the
I nivci sit\ has to offer."
Some of the other immediate
short-term solutions include: c re

Dorm-affiliate program
In the meantime, a dorm affili
ate program will be opei ational in
Februarv. Working in conjunc
tion with Residential Fclucation,
Associate 1 Jean of Students Moi i is
(.raves lias put together the de
tails of the program.
I le said that those who wish to
participate w ill eac li be assigned to
a Resident Assistant and Resident
Fellow in a four-class dormitory.
Fhev'll have the opportunity to
participate in events with the resi
dents of the donniton, and will
have dinner with residents. Ihe
program is set to be operational in
Februan.
Sophomore Lisa Prieto, an un
dergraduate parent, said she- was
excited about the program. She
said when she was a freshman, she
was involved in a siniilai program
where she was affiliated with
(lecho.
" I liev didn't exclude me, that
was nic e, 1 liked it. 1 he ('.echo stall
really made an extra effort to in
clude me," she said. She also ap
pro iated having the extra ac ade
mic support provided In dormito
lies, in the form of academic tu
tors, or e-mail reminders to tile
study lists on time.
1 o extend this program tor all
undergraduate parents, not just
freshmen, sounds go<>d to her, she
said.
"It might not he that useful, but
I'd like to he more aware of cam
pus events."
Senior Lindsay Pollak, a Resi
dent Assistant in Mirlo, said the
program "sounds like .1 good idea
and it's important to get integrat
ed with the social scene; the social
scene at Stanford starts in the
dorm."
She also said that "the person
should feel comfortable in the
dorm [and] should have meals in
the dorm two or three times ot

the week."
For the program to work. Pol
lak believes, "both sides need to
actively participate; the dorm
should not be a mere activity re
source."
Graves acknowledged that the
dorm affiliate program was a short
term solution.
"This is a beginning step. In
the long term ideallv, we'd have
programs in [Kscondido Vil
lage]," lie said.
He said that eventually, he
hoped to bring the support s\s
tems of an undergraduate dorm,
such .is Residenti.il Kducation
programs, to KY to accommodate
undergraduates living there.
Ktchemendv added, " I licv'rc
excellent solutions; we'll have to
initialh start them 111 a hapha/ard
way, but by next fall it will be
made a much more regular
process."
I'ndergraduate parents will

also have to wait fora new child
care facility will be built in Stan
ford West, an apartment complex
near campus, by next fall. Another
facility is set to open in 2002 or
200 H.
Reactions
Response to the solutions have
been mixed.
Senior and parent Rebecca
1 rotzkv-Sirr, who attended the
meeting, said that for child care,
"we probabh won't see the results
in time," and added that while "1
haven't seen a concrete plan vet,
the provost is committed to com
ing up with one."
Senior C'.liricelle McC.lond said
that as an older undergraduate
parent, having entered Stanford
.is .1 freshman in 1 9VW and stopped
out for four years, the dorm-affili
ate program might not be .is useful
to Iter .is to some of the vounger
undergraduate parents.

But overall, she said she was
glad that the administration was
taking steps to "recognize the
nature of being an undergradu
ate parent."
Newton said, "I'm really im
pressed with the urgency thev [the
administration] has put 011 the
issue [and] we're anticipating the
actual changes."
Original concerns
One of the paramount con
cerns for undergraduate parents
was inadequate childcare.
"We wanted basically to have
better daycare in an affordable
fashion," McCloud said. Current
ly, there is a two-vear waiting list to
receive daycare at Stanford.
McCloud also explained that
undergraduate parents financial
aid formulas did not account for
the extra cost of having children.
I hev also hope to build a com
munitv of undergraduate parents

in KY an a better social and acade
