Hoover realignment a benefit
to all concerned
I he plan foi realigning the I loover Li
llian and Arc hives with the Stanford I 111-
versii\ l.ibrai ies to build 011 the strengths
of eac b lias been ill development for about
four years.
I he intentions of the plan are to elimi
nate' tcdiindanc \ of effort in building li
brae collections and providing library
services, to ac hieve fiscal and operational
efficiencies and to allow the lloovei Li
bran and Archives to concentrate its ef
forts on fulfilling its original mission.
Kacli and every one of the logical and
well meant concerns you mention or
imply in your editorial have been ac count
ed for in the plan and w ill be ac complished
in its execution. I will address further only
a couple of matters in this letter.
With regard to space for collections, it is
true that growth space in Green I ibrarv is
limited. However, with the completion of

the third module ol the Stanford Auxilian
Lihrarv. now scheduled to occur Sept.
2002, ahout one-half of the existing two
modules of SAL — on campus and ar
ranged m classified order, accessible to
students and fat nil\ six davs per week —
will lie made available foi more brow sable
collections, nearh a million volumes
worth. ()m plan is precisely to assure
mot e brow s.ililc collection storage on cam
pus for relativeb easv access for students
and facultv.
With regard to the future of the
I l(H»ver l.ibt arv and Art hives, it could not
be brighter. All of us tlesire this realign
ment of resources and collet ling responsi
bilities to make more space available to the
Hoover curators for archives and otliei
spet i.il collections mate!ial.
I heir collecting responsibilities for
these genres in then fields of expertise are
the same as thev have been, and the re
sources foi them to s.itish these responsi
bilities are enhanced, not reduced. Access
to them will be as it is now. No damage will
be done to the Hoover Library and
Att hives.
With 1 egartl to the capabilities and staff
for the I niversitv Libraries to undertake
additional responsibilities as per the plan,
one and all should reali/e that both staff
and money are to be transferred to the
I niversity Libraries from the Hoover Li
brary and Archives. ,
And the Hoover curator will not tlis-
appear cither. I he same sort of collabo
rative work clone in the past, the same
contacts, the same relationships with
booksellers and other suppliers will be
maintained.
I hose who use the University Li
braries' collections intensively and who
have worked with the curators in the Uni
versitx Libraries know full well that this
(ad re ol professionals is every bit as expe
rienced and qualified .is that ol their col
leagues in the lloovct Art hive and has ac
complished the building ot collections
even bit as exceptional as those in
I loover.
()ncc again, those who have made ex
tensive use of archives, manuscripts and
i are books in Spet ial (lollections in (ireen
and made use of the magnificent collec
tions in the I niversitN 1 .ibraries will recog

nize comparable if lesser known prowess
in collection-building. Stanford's collec
tions in American studies, in Slavic
history, languages and literature, in 20th
century American literature, in the history
of science and technology, in French his
torv and literature, in Judaic studies and
in many other fields are among the most
extensive of their types anywhere.
Finally, there have been numerous <x
casions in the past, as there will lx* in the
future, involving joint efforts of curators
from both Hoover and the University Li
braries in order to bring a collection to
Stanford. What is best for Stanford is at the
heart of the work of both organizations.
Enhancement, improvement and ex
tension are the themes of the realignment
plan, not damage and diminishment. The
proposed Hoover realignment plan may

Hoover realignment a benefit
to all concerned
I he plan foi realigning the I loover Li
llian and Arc hives with the Stanford I 111-
versii\ l.ibrai ies to build 011 the strengths
of eac b lias been ill development for about
four years.
I he intentions of the plan are to elimi
nate' tcdiindanc \ of effort in building li
brae collections and providing library
services, to ac hieve fiscal and operational
efficiencies and to allow the lloovei Li
bran and Archives to concentrate its ef
forts on fulfilling its original mission.
Kacli and every one of the logical and
well meant concerns you mention or
imply in your editorial have been ac count
ed for in the plan and w ill be ac complished
in its execution. I will address further only
a couple of matters in this letter.
With regard to space for collections, it is
true that growth space in Green I ibrarv is
limited. However, with the completion of

the third module ol the Stanford Auxilian
Lihrarv. now scheduled to occur Sept.
2002, ahout one-half of the existing two
modules of SAL — on campus and ar
ranged m classified order, accessible to
students and fat nil\ six davs per week —
will lie made available foi more brow sable
collections, nearh a million volumes
worth. ()m plan is precisely to assure
mot e brow s.ililc collection storage on cam
pus for relativeb easv access for students
and facultv.
With regard to the future of the
I l(H»ver l.ibt arv and Art hives, it could not
be brighter. All of us tlesire this realign
ment of resources and collet ling responsi
bilities to make more space available to the
Hoover curators for archives and otliei
spet i.il collections mate!ial.
I heir collecting responsibilities for
these genres in then fields of expertise are
the same as thev have been, and the re
sources foi them to s.itish these responsi
bilities are enhanced, not reduced. Access
to them will be as it is now. No damage will
be done to the Hoover Library and
Att hives.
With 1 egartl to the capabilities and staff
for the I niversitv Libraries to undertake
additional responsibilities as per the plan,
one and all should reali/e that both staff
and money are to be transferred to the
I niversity Libraries from the Hoover Li
brary and Archives. ,
And the Hoover curator will not tlis-
appear cither. I he same sort of collabo
rative work clone in the past, the same
contacts, the same relationships with
booksellers and other suppliers will be
maintained.
I hose who use the University Li
