Hoover realignment a benefit
to all concerned
I he plan foi realigning the I loover Li
llian and Arc hives with the Stanford I 111-
versii\ l.ibrai ies to build 011 the strengths
of eac b lias been ill development for about
four years.
I he intentions of the plan are to elimi
nate' tcdiindanc \ of effort in building li
brae collections and providing library
services, to ac hieve fiscal and operational
efficiencies and to allow the lloovei Li
bran and Archives to concentrate its ef
forts on fulfilling its original mission.
Kacli and every one of the logical and
well meant concerns you mention or
imply in your editorial have been ac count
ed for in the plan and w ill be ac complished
in its execution. I will address further only
a couple of matters in this letter.
With regard to space for collections, it is
true that growth space in Green I ibrarv is
limited. However, with the completion of

the third module ol the Stanford Auxilian
Lihrarv. now scheduled to occur Sept.
2002, ahout one-half of the existing two
modules of SAL — on campus and ar
ranged m classified order, accessible to
students and fat nil\ six davs per week —
will lie made available foi more brow sable
collections, nearh a million volumes
worth. ()m plan is precisely to assure
mot e brow s.ililc collection storage on cam
pus for relativeb easv access for students
and facultv.
With regard to the future of the
I l(H»ver l.ibt arv and Art hives, it could not
be brighter. All of us tlesire this realign
ment of resources and collet ling responsi
bilities to make more space available to the
Hoover curators for archives and otliei
spet i.il collections mate!ial.
I heir collecting responsibilities for
these genres in then fields of expertise are
the same as thev have been, and the re
sources foi them to s.itish these responsi
bilities are enhanced, not reduced. Access
to them will be as it is now. No damage will
be done to the Hoover Library and
Att hives.
With 1 egartl to the capabilities and staff
for the I niversitv Libraries to undertake
additional responsibilities as per the plan,
one and all should reali/e that both staff
and money are to be transferred to the
I niversity Libraries from the Hoover Li
brary and Archives. ,
And the Hoover curator will not tlis-
