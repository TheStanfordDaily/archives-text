SFAFFKK — One nagging
question has l>een answered for
Stanford, but another one ]ust
keeps getting bigger.
rh.tt Stanford record for best
start to a season, set In the 1998
Final Four squad? (Consider it tied.
And the endless discussion
about the possibility of a perfect
season? Consider it amplified.
At the newl\ remodeled bank
of America Arena last night, the
the Washington Huskies became
\ ictim number 18bv a94-b.S score,
eoutlesy of another excellent all
around performance from the na
tion's No. I team.
"It's probably the best half of
basketball, particularly on the
road, that we've played [all year],"
said Stanford head coach Mike
Motitgomerv
Kven .m "of!" game by sopho
more guard Casey |acobsen, who
went 2-for-9 from behind the 3-
point arc but poured in a team
leading 1(> points, wasn't enough
to help the Huskies in this one.
Outmatched inside and outside,
Washington sprinted out of the
gate, making live of its first six
shots, but the Huskies' 12-1 I lead
would be the last time thev were
(lose to the (Cardinal (18-0, (">-() Pa
cific 10 Conference).
"When you look .it it from their
standpoint, they're probabh not
going to make the NCAA tourna
ment, but when they're 35 vears
old, they're going to look back on
1 1 ns g.nne and sav I le\. we played
.igainsi the N'o. 1 team in the na
tion,' said senioi Rvan Mendez,
who had 14 points.

"l liat could have been their
motivation, to knock oil the No. I
team, and we couldn't lei that hap
pen."
After senior forward |arron
Collins was fouled chopping in a
turnaround shot and converted
the resulting free throw, Stanford
embarked on an upset-killing 22-1
run to effectively end the game
with about eight minutes left in the
first half.
Washington (8-11. 2-5) went
without a field goal for almost
eight minutes until a short juinpct
bv Curtis Allen cut the margin to
S3-15.
I'lie catalyst for the hot streak
was senior point guard Michael
Mc Donald, who usually runs the
offe nse quietly and leaves the scor
ing to others. Last night, though,
the fiisi half was all about Mike.
I'lav ing Ins most etlic ient game
of the season, Mc Donald was a
perfect 4-of-4 behind the arc in the
first half, taking advantage of the
I luskies' double-teams in the posi
and spotting up foi wide-open
junipers behind the arc. lie- fin
ished the game with I I points, his
sc< ond-highest total of the season,
and tied his cart el high with nine
assists, all in onl\ 23 minutes of
play.
"He was moving the ball and
finding the open guv." said Mont
gomery, "and that's what lies
bee n cloingccinsistentlv. I le sheen
shooting the ball vcr\ well, and
based on the shots he got, there's
no reason lie- shouldn't make
those sli<>ts. '
As pre»li( ient as Stanford was on
offense in the first half, the
Huskies were bad, at least altei
tlieii initial inn. Nothing went in

for head coach bob Mendel's
squad, not outside jumpers, not
short shots in the lane, not even
putbac ks. Ihe Huskies shot onl\
39 percent foi the game and onlv
