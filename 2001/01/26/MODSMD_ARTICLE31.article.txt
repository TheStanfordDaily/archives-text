SA: No, 1 don't think 1 respond to
11 if piano localise I play. It's more
I respond to musicians who are
like-minded. Someone who I leel
musically, we aret oinmg Ironi the
same place. I he idea ol openness to
improvising. We played a live piece first set
.11 the (.ofleehouse. \iul whet) yon re playing
( omplctely free. in the sense ot no strn» ture,
|iisi ready set-go. \«>ii haw to really trnst the
musicians that they're gonna tike the music
someyvhere and he leadet s, not jnsi followers.
All the music I've always loved and listened
too. everybody is a leader. They pla\ with a
lot of conviction and that's realh import.ini
for making innsic together.
I: When \on t.ilk ahont completely free, what
does that mean tor a drummer?
SA: Completely five the piano, bass and
(hummer playing completely free, thei e's no
sii in Hire, no honndaties'. Someone will start
something, and someone will react, and it will
just go somewhere. It doesn't have to Ik'
beats. I hat night, I wanted to get into some
sort of groove. I here's a band that I have that
I play with very rarely that's totally free and
doesn't have to have am kind ot groove
II ling going and tnosi of the time doesn't, and
that's as interesting to me. Listening to it is a
lot harder.
I: With all ot the gigs, there must be some that
stand out as particularly good. When every
thing is going right, what is happening and
how does it feel?
SA: I he really great gigs are the ones where,
mnsu allv. you feel like the band is on the same
page and playing really great and theaudieuc e
is with you, big or small, and everyone is just
kind of high oil the gig. I've had some tran
scendent experiences playing all kinds of
music. not just ja// and improvising.
I: What is the role of the audience?

SA: Well, take the other night at Stanford.
1 here were a lot ot people that weren't listen
ing and a lot ol people that were listening, lint
H u.i.s kind of a loin I room and that's the vibe
there. That doesn't get me demn because
there's a balance, but the lew people at the
front who were really listening and really re
sponding— that makes a dillerence. It's nice
that people are recognizing what you are
doing. And may be the other people are too, in.
their own way. I just try to do m\ own thing. 1
like to play ballads, and if the loom is really
loud, I'm still gonna play ballads.
1: How do you leel when you heat vout songs
being played by other people?
SA: With my regular y\oi kitighand, it's evolved
into a place where anything can happen, and 1
trust the direction that things are gonna m.
Whereas l,ist Iliursdav. 1 fi It like I had to direct
the music a lot more, and it's good to lie able to
do that. Sometimes something will happen
that I don't really like, and niavbe yve'll discuss
it later, oi something is supposed to In- very
specific.
I: N ou're a drummer and a bandleader. I loyv
does that work?
SA: I think it's harder, a lot of times when I'm
composing, and the last thing I think about is
what I'm gonna plav. I don't think ol the
drums as a lead instrument. In terms ol com
posing. sometimes I'll son of write from the
di tuns, but that's not how I'm thinking.
1: Is music al novelty important to von? Where
do new sounds come from?
SA: I think you will evolve into your own
sound. Chat's what I'm trying to allow myselfto
do. to develop myself as an entity. I'm borrow
ing from what I've heard before, but I try to
have nn own voice. I need to pursue my emu
thing regardless of any repercussions. I lie
people I play with are people that I highly re

sped and enjoy plaving with. lTie\ art* doing
tliat too.
1:1 >< >\ on consider yourself a ja/./ musician?
SA: I play ja/./. I improvise. A part ol'me thinks
we've moved bevond ja/./.. 1 think (lie whole la
beling thing is kind ola drag. I wouldn't call
what Medcski Martin and Wood doc s ja//, I
don't think you need to call it ja/./. People like
to call it something that they can relate to
"(>h that's ja/./, it's familiar." It makes a certain
definition of what's going to happen-itnprovis
ing. We don't swing very often. Ja/z was .t time
in the '20s, '30s, '40s. Bebop was an extension
of ja//. Miles and Ornette changed that. Hie
music that we play is related to so many differ
ent kinds of inusi<.
I: Doyon find that a lot ol categories are break
ing down?
SA: I think the labeling thing is just marketing.
Capitalism leads us to have to call everything
something. Package it.
I: What are your priorities?
SA: I've been around and I've seen a lot. I have
my own record company, Artofim heart
Records. It's a one-man institution at this point
because no one has approached me. M\ goal is
to get m\ music out there and have people re
spond to it. There's a lot of work I have to do to
get the music out there. Playing in front of peo
ple is the only way. I'.ven if you're on a record
label. I ake all these jam bauds, thev reworking
really hard, and some of the returns are great.
It's ,i lot of work. But it was that way lot Duke
Islington, ('.tiff Armstrong. In order to get a
record out, 1 had to produce myself. No one
was knoc king on my door to make a record. Po
establish myself as a bandleader, I had to make
a record. People are starting to take me seti
ouslv now.
I: You've got an impressive recording record.

Which recordings stand out tovnn?
SA: Well, Jennv S< heinman record is really in
teresting, a (jnartet record put out by John
/orn. And a trio record by a piano player Paul
I'lemly from Vancouver, with bassist I.yle Kllis.
Hie l | Kirk is prett\ groove oriented. Nels
Cline and I are in a band c alled Stirikbug.
Stinkhug is all about improvising. All the guys
have like 2~> pedals each, there's a lot ol looping
and slut!'.
I: What do von think ol the Hav Area jazz
scene?
SA: Live music on a certain level is thriving. (>n
another level, it could thrive a lot more. Kco
norniailly around here it's prett\ rough, a lot ol
dubs closing, artists can't afibrd to live here be
caitse the rent is so high. Sometimes there's a
sense of hopelessness here, but it's our respon
sibility to rise above thai, lliere is a communi
ty here, but it's somewhat fragmented, so it's
harder to get inspired b\ othei musicians even
though there are inctedibb inspiring niusi
< ians around here. It would be great it the im
provised musit s< ene could come up to anoth
er level and turn into a stronger thing in terms
ol the audience, in tei ins ol people coming out
and showing their appret iation lor tin- music,
liruno's is ( hanging, they're hooking more na
tional acts, ('.ale On Nord is really <00l alx>ut
letting us play. Iliere's so much in place to en
able the music to go to another level. There's
Y< ishi's, which is a great supportive«lub.
1: Any last thoughts?
S V 1 want to play anywhere. I want to play any
where .my place tli.it anyone wants to listen. I
feel like it's the only wav to develop an audience
and have a career pla\ ing music. Von can't ex
pet t to play at the Wat lield if you don't plav ;it
|erry'sshit bar. if you know what I mean. Its a
long process and hopefully there are people
who want to listen to the music. I'm down for
anything.
