Although the scenery is gorgeous and

Part of the blame for the unsettled feel
ing ma\ lie 111 that most famous period
films benefited from the backdrop ola
major event, such as a war, to help fill in
the gaps. In fact, a good joke in the film
stems from this; the old man going after
the widow tells Binoche (who thinks that
she was widowed in WW 11) that Monsieur
died in 1914.
Still, if you can suspend your disbelief
and focus on Binoche's effortless perfor
mance, you'll leave this one smiling.
