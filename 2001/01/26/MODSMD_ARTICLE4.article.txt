### MARK DOMINIK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A iu'vv interdisciplinary program in.in li.it'-
ologv was approved during yesterday's faculty
Senate meeting. I lie program "provides stu
dents an interdist iplinarv approach to the ma
terial remains of past sex ieties." according to the
Uac helor of Aits in An hae<>l( )gv Proposal to the

(onitnittee on I ndergracluate Studies.
I he program, chaired l>\ Anthropological
St ieiu es Prof. |olni Kick, is the first archaeology
program at Stanford.
Also .it the meeting, Kxecutive Directoi of
Human Kesources John Canmiidge presented
11 it- Annual Siafl Retention and Recruitment Is
sues report .
Cammidge voiced several concerns during
his presentation. Ihe 25.5 percent turnover
l.itc- at Stanford mcuis an annual replacement
< ost of $08 million â€” enough to give everv stall
membei a 17 percent raise, Cammidge noted.
Salary is a major lactoi in driving stall from
the I 'niversitv.

"Monc\ comes up frecjuenth as a reason to
leave." ( aininidge said. "People in the $40,000-
$(>O,OOO range have gone through panic ularh
diflic ult times these past few months."
Stanford's lack of pa\ differentiation also
troubled ('.ammidge.
"We tend to pax people approximately the
same wages, and we lose a lot of people. We
need to ask ourselves if we are losing oui best
employees," said ( aininidge.
In a survey < one I tided l>\ William \l. Merc ei.
Inc., departing stall cited la< k <>1 careei growth,
too niiuli work, issues with management and
lack ol recognition as causes lor
then resignation. In an attempt to
curtail stall sepal at ion, C .am midge
asked fat ult\ to talk with tlicit stall
to improve the woi k environment.
"Support vom si.ill, let them
know vou value what they do," said
( aininidge.
Knglish I Vol. Robert Polhenius
noted that there are limits to what
the I.k ult\ ( .in do to improve the
stall woi k em ii (innicni.
" I in not sut prised at the
turnovei rate," saitl I'olhemus.
"|oh classifications have staved

the same, and the nature ol jobs
have i hanged. 1 he proportion ot
time administrative stall spends
proving that [their supervisors]
aren't (l iminals and ti \ mg to sat
isi\ a lar-01l person has gone up
great Iv.
I o keep the si/e of the stall the
same, and to increase the si/.e ol
their johs and the toinple\it\ ol
their johs."
In other action, several senators
expressed concern ahout Nike's
deal with Stanford athletics. Hen
ness\ replied lo these ctiniments,
noting the tlillit ult position ol the
athletic department.
"When we removed advertise
ments front Maples | Pavilion],
we forced budget cuts on the

Athletic Department. I lit* ability
to absorb budget cuts while
being able to maintain commit
ments is limited. All ot us have
some uncomfort with sponsor
ship for student
athletics . . . [but| n is the way the
athletic world works," he said.
Hennessv also asked the I ni
versit\ to conserve power.
"Though the cogeneration
plant provides power to us. we sell
excess power to the grid. We are
part oi the solution.
I o the extent that we are able to
conserve power, we are able to re
distribute it to the surrounding
communities," I le nnessv said.
1 he senate will meet next on
Feb. 8 at the 1 .aw School.
