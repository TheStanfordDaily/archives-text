my parents.
But as I continue to expand my musical

Benson's original talent as a seasoned ja/./
guitarist, and I have come to find out that he
is one ol the greatest jazz guitai ists in history.

jazz-pop-rock to homes (including mine)
where the influent e of |azz had never been.
Since then, Benson has recorded more
th.in a dozen jazz and pop alhums that have
garnered him a total of eight (iranunys and
critical acclaim. I lis recent concert in coii
juuetion with the San Jose Symphony was a
wonderful fusion of his instrumental and
vocal brilliance with the musical elegance of
the symphony. Not knowing what to expect,
1 prepared myself lor an elevator-music in
terpretation of Benson's music. But I was
pleasantly mistaken.
Although the average age of the audience
was early forties, the iniisit itself was as young
and alive as ever. I"he performance sort of
mirrored his career — a fair amount of jazz
guitar instrumentals with a number of Ins

Unison worked with the Beatles? I certainly
didn't. One ol the night's highlights was a
song Irotn his alhnm, "The Other Side of
Abbey Road," which is filled entirely with
(overs ol Beatles times.
The San Jose Symphony's accompani
ment 011 most Benson's selections was su
perh. They blended in seamlessly with Ben
son's hand of seasoned jaz/. musicians. The
symphony gave the miisit a swing element.
It all came together on Benson's rendition
of "Unforgettable" by Nat Kinjj dole. That
one song showcased the essence of the col
laborative project. Benson sang and played
flawlessly over the beautiful string section ol
the symphony. It was the best song of the
night.
l o say the least, (leorge Benson gave a
great show. I'he evening was filled with
quirky anecdotes about his life, lively stories
about the entertainment industry and ongo
ing interaction with the audience.
At one point in the concert, an audience
member yelled out that (ieorge Benson "was
the man." Benson simply smiled, picked up
his guitar and showed us exactly win he de
