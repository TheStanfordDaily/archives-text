Lesset's new album makes you
pause and ask fundamental ques
tions about artists and their work.
1 lie first that comes to mind is. "II
.1 band other then Lesser were to
produce this music, would it ever
make it to such a wide audience?"

h is musu that is inlei ioi. and tlx
name ol the artist makes sense in
tins (ontext.
Ilie follow-up question. and the
more important one, is "\\ hat
the pill pose ol musu : 1 .esse)

magic music hasovet peopleisth.it

(leant than words and gestures
are capable. Lesset makes
point In demonstrating the full ca
pabilit\ ol Ins sound mixes to

When I plaved the litst two
tiaiks. I w,is unsure whether the
stereo s\steiu was broken, because
ol Us defective, set alt h\ electrical
sound ellects. Lesset seems to have
compiled a mix ol people's worst
sonic nightmares. It sabotages
music's power to create an escape
lor people b\ reducing music to a
fragmented incoherent mess.
Your eats feel like they might
bleed when you listen to the whole
album.
The first 10 tracks make you
twinge. However, track seven, ti
tled "Intuit like an inntiit," is not a

Die song, "voice o reason." is
