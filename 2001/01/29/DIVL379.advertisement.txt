Interpersonal conflict
makes most of us uncom
fortable, and it makes some
people physically ill. Yet conflict
is unavoidable in everyday life.
1 low can we reduce the stress and
distraction of conflict? And learn
to bridge differences more
effectively, and build strong
problem-solving skills?
We can start by understanding
the nature of conflict, and the
things that make it harder (and
easier) to resolve.
What Is Conflict?
Conflict involves differences
either mal or perceived - between
two or more parties when:
■ The gain of one party is at the
cost of the other
■ The parties differ on important
dimensions, e.g., values or
preferences
When placed in a conflict, our
actions are often based on:
■ The needs we are trving to
get met
■ The strength with which we
hold on to a particular outcome
■ Our relationship with the other
party
■ Available options
■ The amount of effort needed
to address the conflict
Difficult Situations
Some situations make conflicts
more difficult to settle. For example:
■ Something must get done, but
it's unclear whose respon
sibility it is
■ There are multiple claims to
scarce resources

■ The parties, aren't meeting
face-to-face to discuss their
differences
■ One party is dependent upon
another (e.g., to get something
done or to obtain needed help
or resources)
■ All parties must agree to (or
at least accept) a decision,
such as when they share a
room or apartment
■ Prior conflicts between the
parties are unresolved, or they
have left bad feelings
■ The parties have different
information (also, two people
can witness the same event,
and yet perceive it very
differently)
■ One party anticipates a poten
tial loss (e.g., money, esteem,
honor)
■ One party feels vulnerable or
judged negatively, such as
when a conflict becomes
personalized
■ When a party feels their core
identity has been threatened,
such as when the conflict
challenges deeply-held values
and beliefs inherited from the
family, religion or ethnic cul
ture (they may then be less
appreciative of the other party's
values and less flexible in
p- considering solutions)
Solutions
A satisfying solution to an inter
personal conflict is not a random
event. It takes analysis, hard work,
and the conscious attention of both
parties. 1 iere's what you can do:
■ Understand your own style
of dealing with conflict (e.g.,
Are you overly compliant?
Do you always have to win?)
■ Listen carefully to the other
person (understanding anoth
er point of view means that
you understand, not that you
agree)
■ Be aware of the language you
use - it has an impact
■ See past your own "position"
(your favorite solution to the
conflict) to your underlying
"interests" (what you really need
to come away with), see past
the other person's "position"
to their underlying "interests"
Spend time thinking of potential
solutions that address everyone's
underlying "interests." Look for
common gnmnd. There are often
"win-win" solutions that may at
first go unrecognized.
When you arrive at an agreement,
restate it clearly. It sometimes
helps to spell it out or write a
contract.
