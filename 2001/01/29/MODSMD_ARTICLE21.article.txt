Common sense leads students
to protest de Klerk
li defies common sense when .ill the de
spicable side eflects ol .ip.ti (licicl are re
vealed. .ind there still remains .1 small 1111111-
bei i>! 1 H'<t| >le who refuse to admit that it was
.1 c 1 line against litimanit\ < )nc of these peo
ple is .1 Nobel Pcai c Prize li e ipicnt who was
tepcatcdh caught hint; to a court that up
holds truthful confession as the onl\ prereq
uisite to peat e. I his person was the head of
a state, hut still < laiins he did not know what
the state's hands were doing. When did
common sense become so uncommon?
So let us assume that IW .de Klerk was
( oinpleteh unaware of the state-sponsored
weapons transfer to the Inkatha 112 reedom
Part\, let us assume he did not know about
the death squads operated In Ins ver\ own
SccuritN ( ounul: let us assume he never
knew of the horrendous torture mecha
nisms. the bombings and the bio-chemical
wai fare on the borders of his own state. If he
did not know about this and all the unmcn
tioned atrocities, would it realh be "egre
gious toe,ill him incompetent?
K.\i use me if this is a supet li( lal assess
ment. but (ould this flow of thoughts possi
bl\ U .id to the conclusion that l\W. de Klerk
is eithet incompetent or a liar?
I his whole scenario is not about contro
\eis\ In light of recent publications in The
Dailv. it is ver\ important that ourcommu
nit\ understands that the reaction of disgust,
.is it w.is experieneed In several individuals,
has nothing at all to do with the fear of con-

troversN or the opposition to freedom of
speech. I bis is a matter of pure common
sense.
Today, a man will come to this campus
who was paid $10.000 of Student Activity
Ices. I lew.is originalh s( heduled to speak
about "globalization," a topic that is incredi
bl\ inappropriate when considering the
questions that he has been evading fora
decade now. loo much evidence was pro
duced in the last six years (In the I ruth and
Reconciliation ('.ommission, Amnesty Inter
national, Human Rights Watch and distin
guished historians) that clearly implicates
this man as a human rights violatoi.
Thursday's column ("DcKlcrk speech
provides a valuable learning experience")
pointed out how valuable the learning expe
rieiu e should be and how "certain members
of our community" should not trv to deny
this opportunitx to the rest of Stanford's
community. That is precisch why "certain
members' put very much effort into the or
ganization of a teach-in, a discussion session,
a fact-finding committee and publicitx that
sheds light into "all sides of the story" and
not |ust the Nobel Peace Prize facade.
This is not about controversy, or the fear
thereof. I bis is not about "flippant idealistic
action." This is about dignity.
Kver since there were anti-apartheid ac
tivists (world-wide), two words resonated
throughout the struggle: "Amandla.
Awethu." meaning " Hie Power. It is ours."
It was the people who freed Mandela and it
was the people who redeemed South Africa.
let us recall the assassinated children of

Soweto, ilu- tortured politic,il prisoners and
the 12,000 politit al killings between 1080
and 100.V \\ h\ not relied on the role the\
plaxed in ending apartheid!" Perhaps it is In
tile to compare their role to de Klerk's role.
Pel haps it is not so smart to s.n that I- \\ de
Klerk s role has been ovet st.ttecl — .titer all,
lie did have < ontrol .it the right place, at the
right time (and he used it wiseh when he
lived Mandela). But Amandla was with the
people, not de Klerk.
It is lot all these reasons that "certain
members ol our communit\" litid it diflitnit
to show a warm welcome to K.VV.de Klerk.
( ertain members are not alraid ol contro
vers\ and are not opposed to livedoin ol
speech or valuable learning experiences.
I lowever.bv passively allowing Mt .de Klerk
toentet and exit Stanford s stage as another
honorable, distinguished speaker" would
be a great disrespect to those who died and
sullered as a result ol unspeakable Human
Rights violations.
As the head ol state, F.W. de Klerk dele
gated authorit\ to people who have alreacb
confessed their horrendous deeds, ( .an he
delegate responsibility when evidence
proves Ix'vond doubt that be was aware of
the atrocities?
I his is not about controvvrs\.or the fear
thereof. Ibis is about dignitv and giving
some tribute to the martvrs.

1 bird, ue want to asstire von that the

rare hooks from the Hoover Libran to

However, in ordei to enhance access. it

\n important hv-prodiu t of the realign

new space will allow us to continue our ver\

Kinallv, we reject the notion, suggested
h\ some, that the proposed realignment vi
olates the founding mission of the I loovei
Libran as conceived h\ Herhert Hoover.
In lad, die i caligmncni is consistent with it.
Ii is certainh true that the Hoover Li
brary has alwavs toilet led some general li
hrar\ materials. I lowever, since lis found
ing in 19H), the emphasis of the t ollet ling
program has been on special materials.
I lie .u (jiiisition of hooks and othei materi
als that > an be actjiiiretl through tradition
al libran methods did not become a signif
icant element mil il I lie mid-19()0s.
In the mitl-l*M»(>s, when new funds be
came available from both the I niversitv
and I loovei sown successful fund-raising
ellorts, the I loovei l.ihran broadened its
toilet tiug inissic>n. In atlclition to its historic
role as a libran ol spet ial materials, it .is
