With (old shooting from the
pel nuclei affecting the whole
team, the Cardinal turned inside
to Jason and Jarron Collins, and
the twins delivered, each scoring
IS points, with Jason grabbing 12
i ebounds and Jarron five.
"You have to do something with

Senior Jarron Collins towers over Washington State forward Framecio Little.
Collins's 8-for-10 shooting inside breatlied life into the Cardinal offense
while Stanford shot a measly 1 2.5 percent from behind the arc
shot just 1-of-Hon the half , and as
a team Stanford made only one 3-
pointer, resulting in woeful 12.5
percent shooting from down
town. As a unit, the offense had
trouble getting in a rhythm, and
point guard Michael McDonald
had no assists for the first 20 min
utes.
"I've played basketball a lot of
years," said Jacobsen, "and some
nights you have it, some nights you
don't. Some weeks you have it,
some weeks you don't. This defi
nitely wasn't my weekend, one of
the poorer shooting weekends I've
had, but I'm not worried."
Thanks to 11 points in the first
half (of 23 total) from junior
guard Mike Bush (the Cougars'
most reliable scorer) and several
beneficial bounces on the rim,
Washington State managed to
hang around for the duration of
the half, and Stanford took only
a 34-28 lead into the locker
room.
"We were very frustrated on
the floor and at half time," Jacob

sen said, "but [assistant coach
Blaine] Taylor came in and said
' I his is a situation we're going to
have to deal with at one time or an
other, whether it be today, or a
month from now.'"
Both Jarron and Jason Collins
took Taylor's words to heart. The
senior and junior, respectively,
came out blazing at the beginning
of the second half, scoring 15 of
the Cardinal's first 18 points after
the break. Taking advantage of
Rower's slow feet, the twins
moved around on the floor and
made shots in the lane and base
line by shooting farther from the
basket.
The players only discussed
the 19-0 start, a new school
record, after they were prompt
ed by the media. Jarron Collins
and sophomore Curtis Bor
chardt, who had 11 points and
seven boards, shook their heads
in unison when asked if anyone
had talked about the record in
the locker room.
"That's something for when
we're done playing here at Stan
ford, when I can look back on tin
career," Collins said. "Right now
we're concerned about winning
the Pac-10."
