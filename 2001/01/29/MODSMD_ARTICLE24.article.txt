An the bu/./cr sounded t«> end
Saturday's S4-(»T win over Wash
ington State, looks ot relief were
evident on the faces of the Stan
lord women's basketball team
(10-7,4-3 Pacific 10 C.onference).
After rebounding from a dismal
1-3 start in conference |>la\, the
te am looks like it might fin.tlh be
read\ to return to c hampionship
lot in.
I lie highlight of the evening
was the pla\ of junior guard 1 ii
joli l/idor. l/idor came off the
bench to score a career-high 22
points and grab seven boards.
I fowevet. while her contributions
on the scoreboard were appreci
ated. it was bet poise and confi
dent e handling the ball that made
head coach fata YanDervccr
liapp\.
"The number I like best of F.n
joli's was the zero under
turnovers," said YanDerveer. "I
think we loimd a guard combina
tion, and I hope Knjoli will help
taking some of the pressure from
Nicole [Powell], and we can go
back to more of a 1-2 guard com
bination, rather than a point
guard and two w ings."
Reaching double figures for
points scored onl\ three times this
\ear, l/idor li.is seen limited min
utes lot most of the season. She
usualh pl.i\s the small forward
role and. like the lest of the Stan
ford team, has had to make majoi
changes to hei game to ac count f< >i
the ('.ardinal injuries.
"It has been the biggest acljust
inent I have ever made in basket
ball." said 1/iclor. "I have nevci
played point guard before, but the
past few weeks I have gotten a little
more comfortable with it in prac -
tice, and I think m\ teammates
have gotten a little more confi
dence' m tn\ I).ill handling and
ability to run the team. I think
tonight 1 was |ust on. .ind it was m\
turn tonight."
Although I/idor was able to
lessen the load at the point
guard,, Powell, a freshman, h\ no
means stepped down from her
c enti al role. She was onh •'•tie as
sist awa\ from a triple-double, tal
ly 111g 11 points, 12 rebounds and
nine assists.
\ftcr suffering si\ turnovers in
the opening five minutes of plav,
Stanford seemed to find its game
with about I I minutes to pl.n in
the opening half. Some beautiful
assists from Powell and bac k-to

While Washington Slate w.is
able to < ut the lead to three over
the neyi 10 minutes, Stanford
made c ritical shots in the closing
minutes of the halt to put the (at -

the break.
