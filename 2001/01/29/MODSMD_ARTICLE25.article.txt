letes — mostly from the Seattle
metro area — to rural Pullman has
seemed an impossible task. Wash
ington State head coach Jenny
Przekwas lias imported players
largely from small high schools or
community colleges in neighboring
Western states. Only senior
Yvonne Volkman (Hanford in
Richland) and sophomores Jessie,t
Ottmar (Central Kitsap in Sil
verdale)and Kelley Berglund (Port
Angeles) hail from Washington.
On Saturday against the Cardi
nal, Volkman and Berglund pro
vided the main spark for the

Cougars on the offensive end. but
their heroics couldn't overcome
the Cardinal's solid defensive ef
fort and Izidor's golden touch.
While Izidor has been asked
why she would choose a reserve
role in the Cardinal program over
a starting spot on one of her home
squads, there was no question that
her performance Saturdav showed
the critical role she fills in the Stan
ford lineup.
As Izidor and Knghusen find
their place in the Stanford pro
gram and the Cardinal climbs the
conference standings, the onh
questions that remain will be for
Przekwas and Huskies coach |iine
Daugherty if another class of
Washington preps opt to take their
talents elsewhere.
