### AARON LEVINE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With rainy practice conditions
burdening the Stanford men's golf
team the past couple of weeks,
there was onl\ one sure-fire wa\ to
assure good playing weather: fl\ to
Arizona.
So the 24th ranked Cardinal
will do just that, beginning its win
ter season with a trip toTuscon for
the two-day PING Arizona Invi
tational at The Raven Golf Course
at Sabino Springs.
Seeing its first action since earh
November, when the Cardinal
captured lhe Prestige tourna
ment in Palm Desert, Calif., Stan
ford w ill try to earn its momentum
into today's plav, when action
starts on the 6,900 yard, par-71
course.
"It's a totalh different golf
course, and it's more of a desert
style course," said senior Alex
Aragon, contrasting toda\ s setting
with the woodsv Stanford golf
course. "But most of us have
plaved it, and we should know it
prett\ well."
1 he experience of the Stanford
s(juad is evident in seniors Aragon
and Jimm\ Lee, junior Philip Rowe
and sophomore Jim Seki. Lee is
coming oil an individual title at 1 lie
Prestige, while Rowe hopes to con
tinue his success from the fall sea
son, w hen lie won an individual title
at the Fresno Lexus Challenge.
Joining the travelling team ihis
week in his first appearance in a
major collegiate event w ill be fresh

man Blake Mastalir. Mastalir, who
finished second in a smaller tour
nament .it Santa Cruz in October,
shot .1 final round one-under par
70 in qualifv ing earlier this week i< >
make the live-mail team.
The Cardinal will net its first

true taste of Pacific 10 Conference
competition in the IH-teani field,
with nine of the conference's 10
teams s( heduled to pla\. inc hiding
No. Iti Arizona and No. 22 South
ern ( alifornia.
After a slow si.u i in the first two

tournaments ol the season with
ninth and tenth-place finishes, the
Cardinal has moved up from Ttith
in the national Sagarin ratings to
2(>th after a tilth-place finish 111 the
Nelson lnvit.ition.il at the Stanford
(ioll ( ourse.
Head coach Jell Mitchell
"raised his ex pec tations lor us. and
now us |iist a matter ol meeting
those expe< tations," Aragon said.
According to Aragon, the rais
ing ol the bar has been a major mo
tivating lorce lor everyone on the
team, because "ii helps our men
tality, .ind makes us work even
harder."
As the Cardinal will oul\ be
competing in three events this win
ter before making the five-event
stretch run ibis spring leading up
to the NCAA Championships in
Ma\. Aragon likes to think ol I uc
son as a sort ol barometer.
"Ol course we'd like to start oil
on the light loot and win," Ai agon
said. "Hut we'll deliniteh see
where we are compared to other
teams.
fhe Cardinal is planning on
using the winter season to foc us in
on minimizing mental errors and
improving its short game, includ
ing prac tic mg short putts.
"This is still the practice time,
but once spring quarter hits, we're
all going to have to go [pla\ 1 with
what we've got." Aragon said.
Hut what the team has "got" this
week will still be under the micro
scope when the squad tees it up
toda\ and tomorrow. At least it'll
have good weather.
