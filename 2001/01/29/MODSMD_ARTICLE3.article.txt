apartheid as wronij lias angered
main students on t anpus.
I don't like tin lact that I)e
Klerk is (oininu Ik it as ,i highl\

recognizable figure, as someone
who should be congratulated,"
s.iid senior Ekene Ucligwe. "He
doesn't acknowledge the whole
truth about his administration.
I he reason people are offended is
that he's never admitted any
wrongdoing.'
"The people who are protest
ing don't want to come oil as bitter
or hateful against him, but we just
want him to admit what has been
done, not clem the truth,'' added
I i ligwe.
Students noted that de Klerk's
reputation in South Alrica is no
bettci than it is here. Black and
white South Africans alike do not
bold Ins i egitne in high esteem, ac
(ot ding to Brodie.
"II I were in South Alrica, my
universitx would never invite him
to speak. I was disturbed that
when he was invited, there was no
sense ol the destructive aspects of
Ins administration until the Stan
lord Mm .in Student Association
brought it up." Brodie said.
"It is important to remember
that De Klerk was an integral part
ol the apartheid regime through
out the 1980s and 19905. After he
unbanned the ANC and released
Mandela, there was increased vio
lence, which he did not contain
even though it was his responsibil
it\ as president to do so," he
added. "Stanford [community
ineinbersl need to know the whole
storv. Is de Klerk's historv one of
peace, or one of violence?"
De Klerk will speak m Kresge
Auditorium at 8 p.m.
