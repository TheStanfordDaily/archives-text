In an Op-Ed column in this paper
last week, Eric Hanushek, an econo
mist at the Hoover Institute at Stan
ford University asked, "Can money
alone ease the educational deficits of
New York City students?
"History does not dictate the future
— it doesn't bind the board to squan
der new resourcessaid Hanushek,
who testified for the state in the law
suit. "But if nothing about the board s
structure, decision-making or incen
tives changes, why should anybody ex
pect different results tomorrow?"
This system has proven that. The
Board of Education gets $11 billion to
educate its students — that's more
than 41 states receive for public edu
cation. And with that $11 billion, this
city has failed to see any real improve
ment in reading and math scores, fa
cilities or teachers. In fact, with an
ever-increasing budget, still less than
50 percent of school kids can read at
grade level.
