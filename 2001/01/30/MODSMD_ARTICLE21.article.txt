approved Stanford's general
use perinil this December, (hey
rejected then-hoartl member Joe Simitian's
proposal to protect the Foothills for 90
wars. I hey did, however, require Stanford
to protect the valuable land from develop
ment foi 2f> vears and called upon the I ni
versitv to produce <i "sustainahility study to
report on the impact of long-range devel
opment plans on the environment.
We believe that the University should
product public sustainahilitv studies on
.ill of its operations. In many <>1 its func
tions, the I niversitv does not public i/.e its
long-range planning, and therefore post
pones debate until the long-term has be
come the present, lor instance, take the

merger of the I loover collection with the
University's library system. Though in the
works for four years, this plan was not an
nounced until the decision to merge was a
forgone cone lusion.
Long-range planning should involve
more members of the I niversitv commu
nity. A good example of sue h an effort was
the I'nivcrsitv's development of a new
cotet ininal program in the School ol Kdu
cation that would graduate students with
elementarv school teaching credentials.
In this particular case, an e-mail was sent
out to tlie entire undergraduate body last
Year seeking input on the new proposal
to.
I he secrecv of some long-range plan
ning mav siinplv result from communica
tion problems on campus. Perhaps stu

dents and alumni remain uninvolvcd in
planning decisions due to apathy or be
cause the* faculty and administration do
not know how to engage them. While the
I niversity's long-range planning often
occurs with only minor input from the
larger community, other times it is not
even sought out at all.
I he problems with long-range plan
ning have manifested themselves in the
building of new housing facilities, which
have ac cumulated in conjunction with ris
ing numbers of students and oil-campus
housing costs that were not acted upon
until thev reached crisis proportions. In
stead of such emergenc v developments,
the University could have projected its
growth and drawn up a framework for fu
ture' development — with community

input.
More open long-range planning could
have possibly prevented several ol the
problems the I'niversity faces, including
the thousands of graduate students,
lower-income workers and many faculty
members desperate for affordable hous
ing in this expensive real estate market.
1 he housing issue, however, is just one
example. Ihe Countv has now forced
Stanford to plan seriously for the future
when it comes to land development/but
the I niversity must also think long-range
about issues such as tuition, the academic
curriculum and the future of university
industry lies. Such planning should be
undertaken in the open. As affec ted com
munity members, we deserve to be a part
of the process.
