# I HAVE ISSUES
## It's a wide, wide, wide world 
### 
We oft en go to big buildings
with flashing lights to sii
in semi-darkness toi alew
hours and gorge our
selves on salt\ treats, whethci popcorn
in (mi laps 01 tears in our eves. In fact,
jusi I his weekend I elected to avoid the
racing St an ford party scene in favor of
an evening at the movies.
Movies are so satisfying. 1 hey have
a definite beginning and ending, aN
organization usualh absent from real

life. At the movies, we
are omniscient spec
tators, not partiallv
informed obsei vers
sti iving for the truth.
Movies allow us to
relax and lose our
selves in a world of
c\| >et ience ((unplete-
Iv different from our
ou n; they provide us

uiih tunc h-needed entertainment.
Mm while this c liarac teri/ation ap
plies lo mosi films, what about those
iiKiYics ih.it do more than simply en
tertain .md t oik h out s\ mpat hies? I 'm
not interested in the effects of these
movies 011 the viewer, hut rather how
this impart is achieved. Actually, how
is the impact achieved in anv creative
art? Novels, poetry, plays, music and
dance can affect people in the same
wav as film does. Hut let's use film .is
the example.
l or me. what sets good film apart
from had is the abilitv to convey life's
subtleties and ambiguities. We all
enjoN watc liing a trite, pleasing
movie tli.it leaves no questions unan
swered and no problems unsolved,
hut it troubles us to watch films th.it
more closeh resemble our own life
experiences.
I c an't think of .1 single episode in
ni\ life that had both a definite begin
ning and ending. \l\ life is a big float
ing mess of expectation, experiences
and reflection that interconnect hut
do not follow .inv neatly ordered time
frame. Re.il life often fails to follow
conventional chronology, even
though we have become accustomed
to such .1 notion through creative arts
sue h as film.
We have been conditioned to place
out thoughts and experiences 111 sonic
sort of uniform framework by the rep
resentations of life we see on screen.
F.ven worse, we have learned to reject
aspects of our lives that do not fit into
this limited framework. A lot of c ra/v

stuff happens in this world, and we
brush it aside 01 dismiss it as impossi
ble simplv because u is the unexpect
ed. a contradiction <>112 our paradigms
and routines.
I'm not t.liking about paranormal
Oct ui 1 elites such as I F( )s and
gliosis. (Suffice it to sa\ that "the
I nub is oiu there.") But when we
refuse to believe tli.it unexpected,
bi/.arrc or unsettling occurrences
ma\ take place because of our
propensity to filter out tlx- unusual
in preference foi the storybook pint,
we suffer practical consequences.
li sso eas\, foi example, to < ategori/e
or stereotype people along familial
lines. Su< li a response, however, ignores
the ambiguities and idiosvncracics of
human personality. Trite constructions
of life presented via artistic media often
show us that true happiness 1 esults from
the combination of perfect ingredients.
Hut let's be honest. I his is life*, not " I he
Brad\ Bunch." Happiness, which is
nevei perfect 01 permanent, requires
struggle .mild (onditions both difficult
.iikl mi pi edit table. Viewing life through
the lens of a plot line makes us give up on
oi lose interest mom person.il struggles
too quic kl\ because the expected end
rarelv ou ins. if it oc curs .it all.
1 am not so concerned that we are
missing a great deal in our lives, but
that we remain unaware that we are
missing anything at all. I mentioned
earlier that movies tend to cast us in
the role of omniscient spectators.
From beginning to end, we see every
thing, or at least everything that mat
ters. I bis complacent position is ex
tremely dangerous, because it pre
vents us from questioning our experi
ence, from proceeding deeper into an
examination of interpersonal interac
tions and self-reflection. ()bviouslv, we
cannot keep tr.u k of, let alone explore
the meaning of, everything going on
around us. However, if we can re
member that some of these unknown
aspects of life manifest themselves with
unforeseen consequences, our own
lives mav start providing the intrigue
and diversion that we usually seek in
the movies.
It's time to get out of the dark room
and open ourselves up to the world be
yond the camera lens.
