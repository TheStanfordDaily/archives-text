Monorail not the solution to
Bay Area traffic problems
An editorial 111 I lie Daih last Friday,
|an. 20 (" I.(x al monorail well worthy of
consideration") recommended that plan
ners take into consideration the proposal
of a local group to build a "monorail" in
the South Bay Area, l he editorial was not
entirely accurate, however, and the mono
rail plan is not based in the realities of the
Ba\ Area transportation situation.
The proposed system, with small vehi
cles traveling on demand directly to their
destinations, could not supplant conven
tional rail services, l he system's parent
concept, called Personal Rapid Transit, is
not <i high-capacity, corridor-oriented
mode of transit as is ('al I rain. It is meant
to serve areas of dispersed development,
such as the office complexes of high-tech
firms in Silicon Valley, where travel pat
terns are irregular and there is little clis
cernable rush hour period. An experi
mental implementation of this system
(later sc rapped) was initially proposed for
Rosemont, 111., a quasi-urban village of

mid-rise hotels and office buildings sur
rounding (.hicago's ()'Hare Airport.
While sikli a system would certainly
help alleviate traffic within the South Bav,
it would do nothing for the problem of
suitably c onnec ting the valle\ to the oxer
all area. Although it may seem primitive,
( '.all rain shows much potential as a pri
mary mode of transportation for the
peninsula, and has seen its ridership grcm
sharply despite only limited improve
ments in the last few years.
I lie planned electrification of the sys
tem would permit a faster schedule and
trains every If> to 20 minutes. A proposed
underground extension to the heart of
San Francisco's Financial District would
allow easier connections to existing BAR I
and MI NI lines. Improvements that
would allow express 45-minute San Jose
to-San Francisco "babv bullet" trains, with
a stop in I'alo Alto, are already underway
and should be reach by 2002.
Further extensions of ('.al I rain to the
F.asv Bay over the Dumbarton Rail Bridge
are even possible. All this could be ours for
just under $1 billion. (Providing the same

service with a BAR I extension would cost
over $10 billion.)
It is important not to let visions of a
high-tech "monorail," really a limited-ca
pacih Personal Rapid I ransit svstem, ob
scnre out need lot viable, upgraded con
ventional rail service the length ot the
peninsula and into the valley. 1 he hist time
futuristic visions plagued area urban plan
ners, the exoi hitantly expensive BAR I svs
tem was conceived, which is now well past
its 20-year mark and does not even reach
halt of the area's residents or jobs.
