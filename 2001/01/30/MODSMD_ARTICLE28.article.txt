sweeping No. 1 1 Cal State Northridge 3-0 cm Fritlav
Stanford tolled through its first toad trip of the
conference season to improve to 3-0 overall and 3-0
in the MPSF. The ( ardinal is tied for first place in the
Pacific Division with No. 1 long Beach State (4-0. 3-
0). Both teams are half a game ahead of No. 3 I 'SC.
(S-1,3*1).
Stanford faced a lie>stile crowd in Santa Barbara, as
neat ly 1,300 tans packed Robertson Cvm to see the
Cardinal come awav with a four-game victor\ over
the Gauchos.
"Santa Barbara had a real strong crowd, and thev
were reallv trying to get into our heads, said sopho

his fourth < onset utive double-digit kill performance.
"But we made our own noise and came awav with the

hit over . 100 for the fourth time this season.
Senior middle blocker Brett Youngberg also
added 1 1 kills and sophomore outside hitter Kyle
Strache tallied 8 kills while hitting at a .727 clip off the
bench.
"We had a very balanced offense," said Young
berg, who also led the team with five blocks. "A cou

Cardinal battled back behind
strong serving from Straclie to tie
the match at 28-28, but Stanford

Nieves was still pleased with the
play of Straclie, a reserve. Stra
the's performance is indicative of
the strong play of the C.ardinal
bench all season.
"Kyle was a kev for us against
Santa Barbara," Nieves said. "He
was a big part of us turning the

second game around and taking
control of the match in games
three and four."
Stanford regrouped offensive
ly for the final two games and
dominated the C>auchos to close
out the match with 80-22 and HO

On Friday night, the Cardinal
used another dominating offen

out of its game early. Stanford hit
.700 in a first-game rout in which
the Matadors managed onl\ nine
kills and pic ked up nine hitting er

Things didn't get much better
for Northridge in game two, as the
red-hot Stanford attack outkilled
the Matadors 21-12 to post a 30-
25 victory for the Cardinal.
Northridge showed signs of lift
in the final game, holding with
Stanford to 28-28, but another
strong blocking and digging per
formance bv the Cardinal sealed

the Stanford victory. The Cardi

match.
Freshman middle blocker
Billv Clavton overcame the flu to
post 10 kills and a .833 hitting
percentage, while also adding
three aces and four blocks for the
Cardinal.
Stanford hits a lull in its sched
