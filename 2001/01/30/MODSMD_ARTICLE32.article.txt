## 
### LILY LIU 
With three dual meets left
before the Pacific 10 Confer
ence c hampionships, each race
for the No. 2 Stanford men's
swim team (5-0) brings them a
sti oke (loser to the conference
title. Returning from a pair of
competitive dual meets in Ari
zona. the team will take a
break from Pac-10 competi
tion and host the I niversitv of
the Pacific (5-3) in a dual meet
today.
1 he faceoff with the Tigers
will be .i prelude to one of the
season highlights: the show
down with I S( 1 on Friday.
"(I OP is) not as strong as
the Pac-10 conference teams we
meet, but it's .i verv important
meet because it's a tune-up
meet for our guvs for I SC.
that's coming up on Friday,"
vikl head coach Skip Kennev.
I he purpose of dual meets
throughout the season is two
told. Among the short-term
goals are to accumulate the best
possible record and achieve
\( AA (|ualifying marks. These
direct matchups are meant to
gauge performance through
out the season against some
major competitors, but for the
( animal, the se.ison converges
on two meets â€”the Pac-10
championship and the NCAA
championship.
"You use dual meets to get
better, to find out what your
weaknesses are and how to

work on those weaknesses and
make your way to the champi
onship meets," Kennev said.
Today's meet provides a
chance for the entire team to
gain rac ing experience.
"Cuvs who didn't make the
travel team can swim and
make their progress. It also
gives guys (on the travel team)
an opportunity to swim sec
ondary events and improve
upon their performances,"
Kenney said.
The men benefit from lead
ership from upperclassmen as
well .is underclassmen. The
team boasts senior Ail-Ameri
cans such as Adam Messner,
Steven Brown, Anthony Robin
son and Rob Canales, but has
seen younger swimmers
emerge as leaders as well.
The solid sophomore c lass
featured Pac-10 champions
and NCAA finalists last season
and has continued to improve
on last vear's suc c ess.
This year's large freshman
class has produced some bud
ding stars. Freshmen Markus
Rogan and Michael Bruce have
both posted impressive NCAA
qualifying times early in the
season.
The team has generated mo
mentum in each of their meets
that will carry them into the
Pac-10 championships as the
arguable favorites and into the
N( 'AA championships as a seri
ous contender for the national
title.
