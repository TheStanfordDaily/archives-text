### TREVOR SUTTON 
I ..Ist week, 29(i under'gradu
ates applied to stuih next tail at
one o! Stanford's eight overseas
programs, an increase of ."> per
< ent from last yeat.
I lie numbers reflect prelimi
nary statistics aftei the |an. 26
deadline and may continue to rise
as late submissions trickle in and
programs that did not reach <a
pacit\ in the regulat proci-ss con
tinue to acccpt applications.
I hetentei in Santiago, Chile,
saw the sharpest t ise in interested
students, with .">7 applit ants com
peting for 10 spots, an in< i ease of
21 students from the 1999-2000
term.
Stanford .it Oxford, tradition
al the most popular overseas
stl l<l\ spot, received the largest
number of applications: 90 stu
dents for 17 openings. I he com
petitiveness of the program is
often attributed to the lack of a
foreign language requirement as
well .is to ()xford I niversity's vast
academic offerings.
Meanwhile, Stanford in Paris
and Stanford in Florence saw a
slight decrease, although the

numbci of applic ants still exceeds
the available slots in both loca
tions.
Students dc< ide to abroad
i mining the gamut from research
opportunities to < iilnu.il and lin
guistii immersion to a niuch
needed break from rigorous en
gineering (lasses.
|oe Shapiro, a sophomore in
terested in economics and pliilos
opliv. applied both to the Most ow
and Santiago centers.
"A lot of the attraction is the
opportunity to learn an entirely
new language that opens lots of
doors, he said of Moscow. "I am
also interested in seeing the tran
sition to democ 1 ac\ and the
process of development litst
hand."
