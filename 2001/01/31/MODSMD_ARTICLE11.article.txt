1977
On Jan. 31, 1977. The Daily ran an article
about the construction of the lerman Engi
neering Building.
"The Frederick E. Terman Engineering
Building, scheduled to be completed in
April, is one of the most energy-conscious
buildings ever built on this campus.
"Among its revolutionary features: win
dows that open.. ..
"Planning on the $9.2 million 1 erman
Building began in 1973 at the height of the
energy c risis. C )rginiall\ . . . the engineering
school faculty wanted no part of the build
ing to be artificially cooled. . . .
"Roughlv 70 percent of lerman will lx
air-conditioned, according to senior planner
(.am>ll Rankin, architect for the project."
Bottom line: Windows that open? We're moving
on up.
