The way people go about controlling
their reactions to emotional events af
fects their memory of the extent, ac
cording to new research published in
the Journal of Personality and Social
Psychology published by the American
Psychological Association (APA).
That people can regulate the inner
experience and outer expression of
emotions is well documented in the
psychological literature. Psychologists
Jane M. Richards, University of
Washington and James J. Gross, of
Stanford University sought to learn
whether such efforts to control emo
tion have cognitive consequences.. . .
Drs. Richards and Gross suggest
that there are many ways to regulate
one's emotions, but that some ways of
doing so may be particularly likely to
impair one's ability to remember the
details of an upsetting extent.
