coalitions are crucial in prompting the I ni

I lie ways in which the I niversity re

support, exploration, and outreach lor the
centers — the Asian American Activities ('.en

conunuuitv renters. A center wilh barely
functional space and minimal money falls
into the trap of needing to focus on adminis
trative expenses at the expense of substan
tive programming.
As articulated in last week s meeting, the
(ommunitv (enters need enough functional
space for their members to assemble; they
need enough stall to respond to community
needs while planning and implementing out
reach events; the\ need adequate and pre
dictable funds for programming, develop
ment .ukl implementation ol their articulat
ed missions.
I he I niversitv has an obligation to sup
plv its departments with such essential pro
visions, .uid the connnunitv centers are no
exception.
