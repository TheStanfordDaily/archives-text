# Schools seek gender fairness
## Heads of nine schools look to end imbalance in engineering, science 
### MARK BOUCHER SCOTT DORFMAN 
Nine leaders of prominent research
universities, inc hiding Stanford I nivci
sit\ President |ohn Mennessv, released
a statement yesterda\ acknowledging
that "barriers still exist" for women fac
ulty in the sciences and engineering de
partments.
l he schools promised to analyze how
resources like pav and research space
were provided to women faciiln and to
reconvene in .1 vear to track their

progress. The statement, .ilso signed In
25 women facultx from these schools,
stems from a meeting .it M 1 I sponsored
In the Ford Foundation.
It recogni/ed that solving the prob
lem might require "significant change
within . . . each university, and within
the scientific and engineei nit; establish
ments as a whole."
In addition to Hennessv, three Stan
ford professors attended the workshop:
Management Science and I iigineei ing
Prof. Margaret llrandeau, \'ice I'rovost
for Facult\ Development Patricia |ones
and Education Prof. Mvr.i Strober.
Leaders and facult\ from C.altech,
Harvard, MIT, Princeton, I C-Berke

participated in the dialogue. 1 he Anier

it.in Association for the Advaiu en lent of
Science and the Ford Foundation were
represented at the meeting.
Provost |olm Ftchemendx expressed
support for the group's conclusions.
"It's a terrific statement of what we want
to achieve," he said.
Some women fac tilt\ also cheered the
agreement.

ceive doctoral degrees in hard
sciences, such as physics and

said Stanford needs to address
this type of "pipeline problem."
According to Etchemendy,
Stanford has policies that provide
incentives for women and mi

areas, as well as programs to
specifically recruit women. These
programs allow women to per
form more research, thereby in
creasing their chances of receiv

"We would like to have a much
higher percentage" of women
faculty in science and engineer
ing, Etchemendy said. "We can't
be content when the availability
pools are so low."
The workshop focused on
strategies the schools have tried
in the past, the systemic causes of
the problems and new actions
that the schools can take individ
ually and collectively.
The meeting featured a dis

from women's past experiences.
