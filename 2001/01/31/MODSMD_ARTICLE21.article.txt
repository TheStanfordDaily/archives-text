Monogomy should be questioned
As I read vour article "Students dome
('.leanon (-heating"oll Mondav. I w.issad
dened to see no mention of open relation
ships, or anv (juotations from students
who would examine, rather tit.in abruptly
end, their relationship with .in unfaithful
partner.
K.ven though we have a long tradition
and plentN of laws encouraging us to see
rom.mtK relationships ,is mutual and ex
clusive ownership of eat h other, most men
and women still find monogamy difficult.
I find that interesting.

I wonder, il it were love, rather than
propet t\ rights, we were concerned
about, how main ol us would encourage
out partners to eiijo\ multiple lovers.

De Clerk protest was unjust
I write i<> oiler mv protest against the
Stanford All u .111 Student Assot iation s re
sponse to I'.W. de Klerk's speech .11 Kre
sege auditi >1111111 last Mondax.
De Klerk gave a moving and inspired
speei li on the struggles ol Ins nation to end
the apartheid regime. When he began his
politic al career, apartheid and t lit- associat
ed (list 1 iniination were meant as a "tetnpo
-1 an solution that would guide South All n a
into several looseh united nation-states,
eai li with a diflerent ellinii identit\.
While most of us disagree with the basis
ot this plan, we must understand that 111
1970, it was a politic.al ideal. 1 >e Klerk dis
-1 ussed. with a touching display ol passion,
the painful realization that he and his
party gradually came to â€” that apartheid
was tailing and wrong.
I he Stanford Afrit an Student Associa
tion accuses de Kletk of "refus|ing| to
admit that apartheid was a crime against
humanity," and yet everyone in that
packed auditorium heard him describe
the regime as "moralh indefensible" and
"manifestly unjust." We heard him a polo

gi/.c for tlu- "pain, suffering and indigni
ty." hut .1 minority of the audience appar
ently It'll that lie had "redelcgated his re
sponsibility."
The association also accused de Klerk
of (onspiring and l\ about a number of
substantial human tights violations. While
I do not denv or affirm these particular
cl.iims. it scents i ashly unfair to ignore the
t Innate of the countrv, de Klerk's obvious
commitment to peace and the gross atroc
itics that were committed against de
Klerk's party as well.
I he association feels that de Klerk did
not (lis|>la\ enough courage when he
stood up against the regime he recognized
as wrong, but that perception ignores the
(outage it took to, after "losing bielection
aftci bielection." demand a referendum
and a mandate to continue his work.
The association does not seem to ac
knowledge the role tli.it this impassioned
and intelligent man played in leading
South Africa awa\ from the threat ofa civil
war and towards a peaceful transition to a
democratic society . And so, after de Klerk
asked foi "black and white to take hands
[and] devise plans" a minority of the audi
ence still felt compelled to, in the words of
K.W. de Klerk, "face the future with their
backsides, while the majority [was] looking
the future in the eye and accepting the
challenges."
