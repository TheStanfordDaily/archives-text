Palo \lto C.it\ Manager Frank Henest

said.
Morton (ailed the acceptance of the con
(cptnal agreement "a good first step" toward
.1 i es< tint ion.
S,m<l\ Blovatl, executive director ol the
|(.(i, agreed, saving "(the agreement] is ab

entire tiling work."
I he tlnee-wa\ deal between Stanford. the
m hool district and Pah) Alto is a complicated
mailt i that requires "a number of bilateral

working to reach a final agreement. I he
group is compt >sed of Morton, Bit >vad, Henest
and Don Phillips, superintendent ol the Palo
Alto Si hool I )isti n t.
I believe that ilus tan all be resolved,"
Morton said. "We at Stanford will dcfinitelv
live up to out ( ommitmcnt."
Stanlord offered in the fall to make the
Ma\ field site, lot aletl at the intei set tion ol 1.1
( annuo Real and Page Mill Koatl, available to
the fit\ lot use b\ the |( i ..
1 lie I nivei sit\ will lease it to the city at $ 1
pel vcai loi . r > 1 wars.
Stanloi tl w ill also contribute $ 10 million to

I lie* school district, whose schools serve the
children of Stanford faculty and staff. I his
money will Ik- used to renovate the Perman
site for the new middle s< hool.
In exchange, Stanford is proposing .1
transfer of its development lights fot the
Mavfield site to other sites in the Stanfoi d Re
search Park. In effect, the agreement will
allow the I niversitv to build on 1 esearc li pat k
land what it could have built 011 the Mafield
site. Stanford will be able to exert isc these de
velopment rights lor up to 25 veai s.
liv accepting the lease, the < it\ would also
agree to a full mitigation of am possible effet is
on < itv-provided sei vices from the transfei. Ihe
I niversitv does not believe that the modifita
tion of development rights will cause am bur
den on these coinmunit\ services in Palo Alto.
Norton said that the University "doesn't
believe that Stanford and its population are a
drain on the communitv's resources." ()n the
contrarv, llorton s.iid, the I niversitv opens
manv of its resources to community. He
noted that seven times more people visit the
Dish than visit Foothill Park, a local park
owned In the cit v.
Act 01 (ling to Blovad, the |( i( main con
cern is with acquiring "legal certainty" about
the new site. "A number ol Inn dies have to be
met" before a (inal agreement will be made.
Blovad said.
I lie debate ovei the new school location
stems from the s( hool disti k t's using enroll
ment, which necessitates a third middle
school, flic school district used to operate a
s< liool in the let man Middle S( hool building
in Palo Alto, but due to de( lining enrollment,
the district (losed the s» hool sevet al veai s ago
and sold the site to the ( itv of Palo Alto.
