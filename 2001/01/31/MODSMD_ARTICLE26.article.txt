# Soccer looks to Sampson
## 
### 
Just over one week after men's soccer coach
Bobby (.lark departed Stanford to coach Notre
Dame, Athletic Director Ted Iceland may be dose to
finding his replacement.
The San |ose Mercury News reported that Steve
Sampson, who formerly coached Santa Clara and the
U.S. national team, is the leading, and so far the only,
candidate.
SPORTS NOTEBOOK
"Steve has exceptional credentials," Leland told
the Mercury News. He added that Stanford was
"very interested" in hiring him.
If Sampson does come to Stanford, it would mark
his first return to coaching since his resignation as
the U.S. coach after an 0-3 record in the 1998 World
Cup. He has worked with the California Youth Soc
cer Association since January 2000.
Sampson expressed interest in taking over the
Cardinal, which finished one match short of the Col
lege Cup this season.
"Stanford, to me, would be a perfect fit," Sampson

told the Mercury News. "I interviewed there . . . and
I thought it went very well. We discussed the needs
for my family and what it would take to make the
move. If I'm their choice, the next step is for them to
come back with a final proposal."
Wrestling
For the Stanford wrestling team, the trip down to
Bakersfield is not the most exciting bus ride of the
season. Sunday's ride home, however, must have
been worse after the squad was handed a decisive 33-
8 defeat at the hands of the Roadrunners.
The Cardinal (3-7, 0-5 Pacific 10 Conference) fell
to Cal State-Bakersfield (8-3, 3-0 Pac-10) even after
the Roadrunners had met, and defeated, Portland
State earlier in the day.
Redshirt sophomore Justin Walker provided a
bright spot in the meet with a 10-3 victory in the 133-
pound weight class over Joe Garcia. The win was
Walker's 19th for the season, the leading total on the
Cardinal.


JOANNA HIATT/The Stanford Daily File
Sophomore Justin Walker leads the Cardinal with 19 wins this season. Stanford has lost its last five dual meets, dat

"Steve has exceptional credentials," Leland told
the Mercury News. He added that Stanford was
"very interested" in hiring him.
If Sampson does come to Stanford, it would mark
his first return to coaching since his resignation as
the U.S. coach after an 0-3 record in the 1998 World
Cup. He has worked with the California Youth Soc
cer Association since January 2000.
Sampson expressed interest in taking over the
Cardinal, which finished one match short of the Col
lege Cup this season.
"Stanford, to me, would be a perfect fit," Sampson

told the Mercury News. "I interviewed there . . . and
I thought it went very well. We discussed the needs
for my family and what it would take to make the
move. If I'm their choice, the next step is for them to
come back with a final proposal."
Wrestling
For the Stanford wrestling team, the trip down to
Bakersfield is not the most exciting bus ride of the
season. Sunday's ride home, however, must have
been worse after the squad was handed a decisive 33-
8 defeat at the hands of the Roadrunners.
The Cardinal (3-7, 0-5 Pacific 10 Conference) fell
to Cal State-Bakersfield (8-3, 3-0 Pac-10) even after
the Roadrunners had met, and defeated, Portland
State earlier in the day.
Redshirt sophomore Justin Walker provided a
bright spot in the meet with a 10-3 victory in the 133-
pound weight class over Joe Garcia. The win was
Walker's 19th for the season, the leading total on the
Cardinal.

ing back to Nov. 24 against Portland State, and has just three more left before the conference championship meet.

Just over one week after men's soccer coach
Bobby (.lark departed Stanford to coach Notre
Dame, Athletic Director Ted Iceland may be dose to
finding his replacement.
The San |ose Mercury News reported that Steve
Sampson, who formerly coached Santa Clara and the
U.S. national team, is the leading, and so far the only,
candidate.
