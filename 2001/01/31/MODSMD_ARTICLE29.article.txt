## a 						weekly look at science and techology at Stanford Bits and Bytes: Fun with toilet water 
### JOSHUA BENSON EDITORIAL STAFF 
Mush a toilet the next time von're standing
on the equator. 1 lie water won't swirl.

to do with water, rivers, lake s or oceans. de

light.
Our Neanderthal ancestors had larger
brains than us. And skulls. And. well, just
about everything.

lake your boomerang out to Wilbur Field
and practice getting it to return. C'.ot that?

Now, throw it as hard as vou can. I'hysics
won't let the booinei ang go an inch lurthei
