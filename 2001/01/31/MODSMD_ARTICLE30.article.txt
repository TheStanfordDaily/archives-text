# A 						new class of drugs talks to patients

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Hu
man squints at his medication,
but his dimming vision can't
make out even whether lie
picked up the Coumadin or
Celebrex. So he aims a gadget
the size of a deck of cards .it the
bottle, and a computerized voice
begins reading Ins prescription
instructions.
('-all them talking drugs: If
pilot testing goes well at two
Chicago hospitals, blind and el
derly Americans could soon
begin buying prescriptions with
"smart labels" that read aloud the
potentially lifesaving fine print.
Millions of Americans have
eyesight so bad they can't read
newspaper type, and thus strug
gle with medication bottles ili.it
put the drug's name, dosage and
important safety warnings in
even smaller print.
It's a problem that's only going
to worsen as the aging population
booms.
Inability to read pill bottles
can lead to very dangerous mis
takes: taking the wrong pill at
the wrong time; or the wrong
dose; or missing the warning
not to drink alcohol or take var
ious over-the-counter drugs
with the prescription. Or even
when to call a doc tor about side
effects.
Enter Scrip Talk. Beam a small
voice synthesizer at a prescription
bottle with a special computet
clup embedded into the label.
1 he wireless tec hnolog\ trans
lates the printed label into
speech, literally reading aloud
the pill instructions.
Manufacturer En- Vision
America Inc. of Normal, 111.,
hopes to begin selling Scrip I alk
this summer. First, vision-im
paired veterans .it Chicago's
Hines Veterans Administration
Hospital are pilot-testing the
gadget to learn how helpful it
trulv is — and nearbv Rush-

I'rcshvterian-
St. Luke's Medical Center
soon begins .1 separate siucl\ to
see il Scrip Talk could reduce
medication errors.
"When vou're vision-impaired
...it's verv difficult to find the ncc -

essarv information" to use a di ug
properly, explains Rush pharma
cist Bruce Caynes.
"Our major goal, and what
these systems would allow, is
greater independence, adds
Jem Si butter, chief <>112 blind
rehabilitation scrvic cs at
I lines.
Hities so far has taught a

do/en veterans to use Si rip I alk
at home. Some "are vcr\ hap[>\
with it. Sc butter said. Others,
iisiiallv 11 it- verv elderlv, still pre
fer famih members to read then
pill bottles to them.
I he pilot test isn't over vet,

but w ill help detet mine if
Si 1 ip 1 alk pi o\ ules enough ben
efit fot the VA to offer it once
sales begin.
Si rip I alk isn't the onl\ sin h
attempt: Hines also lias a hand
ful of veterans testing New
York-based Asko < 01 p. s Aloud,
where pharmacists record drug
labels into listening devices for

patients.
Snip Talk, m contrast, har
nesses wireless tec hnolog\ to let
computers svnthesi/e the talk
ing label automatic allv.
Rush's planned 'JOO-patient
siii(l\. which also will investi
gate low-lech solutions sue h as
larger-pi int drug labels, will ex
amine whether Scrip Talk re
duces medication erroi s, thus
saving money as well as pre
venting in jurv. I li.it si ud\
could help insurers and phar
macists decide whether to pa\
for the device.
Scrip 1 alk won't be cheap,
Schutter cautions. Kn-Vision
would send participating drug
stores blank, microchip-embed
ded "smart labels.''
Kach drugstore would have to
l>u\ a special S 1.000 priutei th.it
encodes the microchip to read
each label once it's printed.
Patients would buv a battery
operated Sc rip 1 alk rcadci. for
about $2f>o, tli.it works on am
smart-labeled pill bottle. A talk
ing label initialh should add SI
t<> each prescription, a price
that would drop as more were
sold, Kn-Yision sa\s.
At Hines, pharmacists had lo
write special software so the
Scrip I alk printer could read
the YA's patient prescription
i ec orcls. a link retail pharmacies
may have to figure out, too.
But Kn-Yision, which has
begun pitching Strip I alk to
drugstore c hains and insurers,
savs don't forget one big benefit:
Not every drugstore will sell
talking prescriptions, so those
that do could gain instant loval
clientele among the millions of
vision-impaired patients.
Not to mention the tec hnolo
gv could be modified to help
people w ho can't read prescrip
tion labels for other reasons,
sin h as illiteracy or language
barriers.
