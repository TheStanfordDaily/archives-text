On Feb. 1, HM>9, I lit- Daily reported oil
the development <Â»l.i smog deteetoi at .i
Stanford l.tl>.
"New techniques are being devised at
Stanford's Aerosol I..il)orator\ to make it
easier to detect smog and other contami
nants in the air.
" The labor,itorv s m ientists have devel
oped an air sampling mac bine called the
'Kotorod Samplei whu h, l)\ moving
through air. (.in collei I partu les .ts small as
20 microns in diameter. . .
" I'lie fluorescent powdei tracer tecli
ni(jiie has been used in niinieroiis studies
of .in < nrretits. espct ialh in the Is Angeles
Basin.
"Initial tests there gave siu li sin prising
results that at first the experts would not be
lieve them, until further tests proved the re
sults to be correct." '
Bottom line: Anyone who has flown into Los An
geles and passed through that brown layer on
tne descent knows that you don't need a smog
detector in L A.
