UCLA is heading into some rowdy,
hostile arenas this week. For some
Bruins, the raaeons nature of Califor
nia's Haas Pavilion and Stanford's
Maples Pavilion only accentuates how
quiet things have been at Pauley
Pavilion. . . .
"It's pretty sad," point guard Earl
Watson said. "I'm not sure how many
tickets are offered to the UCLA stu
dents. It doesn't seem like it's a lot. It's
taken a lot of life out of the place. If
you don't get a good ticket, you can't
see the game that well if you 're a stu
dent. Your seat might he way up there.
The students go straight up. not
around the court.from
