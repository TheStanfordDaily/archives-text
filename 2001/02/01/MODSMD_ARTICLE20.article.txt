ON I I KM) \\ IA KM \ (.. ASM
President Siili Newton delivered
ilit' annual "Slate <>l the Yssocia
tion address, in whit h he discussed
the student government's progi ess on various
initiatives. Although significant work remains
helore their tilt>ris can reach fruition, Newton
and Vice President Mali.i \ illegas have made
consitlerable siritles toward putting into ac
tion the platform proposals the\ advotatcd
during lasi year's elet I ion.
Betause Newton and Villegas ran repre
senting ,i consortium of different groups on
campus, it is not surprising that cnmmuni(\
center funding would become one ol the < hit I
priorities of the tint ent \SM administration.
While the ccnlei s have gotten iiu leased fund
ing this vcar, other issues (tin ial to the lutiiie
of these < enters, such as space a\'ailabilil\ and
the al)ilit\ to fttndraisc, have not \et been set

tled. Future progress mav require more of a
lobbying effort bv concerned students and
ASS I brass.
Newton and Villegas have also etnphasi/etl
student input in virtually all aspects of I ni
versit\ decision-making. On the academic
front, the Student Initiated Course program
is tine to I)t- launched in February. I lie ASSI
has also been working to create .1 young
trustee progiam through which a gradu.iting
senior and a graduate student would serve on
the Hoard ol I rustees. Although such a design
exists at several other schools throughout the
( ounti \, Newton and Villegas have a wa\ to go
before it exists here.
With respect to improving sot ial and politi
cal activism on campus, one of the students at I
ministraiions\ top concerns, results have
been encouraging. I'lie Public Service 1101101
Code remains unfinished, but the Stanford

Votei Project, which aimed to increase voter
turnout and civic engagement among stu
dents, was a sut cess.
A primary for the ASSU this year has been
publicity. Many of this administration's pro
grams have been put into effect and have
proven worthwhile, but the ASSI must en
sure thai the programs' existence is known 10
the student hod v. To this end, the ASSU
should concentrate 011 outreach efforts —
whether via e-mail, going door-to-door and /
or publishing the newsletter more frequently
that would enable more students to take
advantage ol these opportunities.
Wliei e Newton and Villegas have made sig
nificant progress is in the ASM s responsive
ness to student concerns and demands. Pro
posals and initiatives like the Workshops on
Action for Change that train students leaders
how to make a difference emerged from tlis-

Mission with various student leaders about
their own needs.
Finally, this administration's collaborative
leadership model, whereby a cabinet of stu
dent leaders has been assembled to work on
each of the major agenda items, has complete
ly revamped planning and decision-making in
the ASSU. As a result, this heightened activity
in student government has generated more
student involvement in the ASSI and dimin
ished the feeling of detachment between the
leaders of the ASSI and their constituency,
the students.
Since their election, Newton and Villegas
have worked conscientiously to fulfill the
promises made in their I'AC platform. With
some additional campaigning, a little follow
through and more informative public relations,
this ASSI administration could produce an im
pressive record of accomplishment.
