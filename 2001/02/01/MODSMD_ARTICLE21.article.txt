# SUMMARY JUDGMENT
## Napster a rebel no more 
### 
Now Uiul Nup.slei us bccuuuug a
"respectable" dot-com, we
have lost tlie most prominent
champion for .iltei nat iv e
views ol cop\ i ight.
A recent press release l>\ the Bcrtcls
maim media group annoiinced that
Napster will he charging .1 subscription
feebv|uneoi 1111\ In addition, \apstei
has recently settled its lawsuit with I V I
Records.

As Napster's and
Bertelsm.mil s opei a
tionsbegin to blui. the
otliei lawsuits will like
ly be dropped as well,
and Napster w ill likeb
join Ama/on and cßa\
as a respet ted tlot-c 0111
giant. While this legiti
mate is good toi Nap

tion in general. U is not without < osi
Napster, togetlici with lamed l.iwvn
David Boies, was primed to lake on the
recording industi \ and i cdclinc in teller'-
tual proper!\ lights l hc Re< 01 ding In
dust\ Association of \mcri< .1. along with
its movie industn twin, the Motion l'i<
lure Association ol \nierica. have been
pressing theii interpi elation ol intclle<
tual propert\ rights 111 both the courts
and ('ongt ess.
For the most pati, the\ have been
winning. I he iiuhistr\-sponsored IWN
Digital Millennium (op\ right \( t set
strict limits on digital copving and distri
bution. 1 .aw suits have shut down compa
nies like S(oui (a less wcll-lundcd ver
sion ol Napster). I 'hanks to theii legions
of lohhvist and lawvers. the radio and
movie associations have become the
dominant voices .11 ti< ulaiing what copv
rights mean in the digital age.
Aside from the oh\ ions < ontlit 1 ol in
terest m such matters, there are three
problems with allowing these groups to
set the standard lor intelle< tual propel i\
protection. First, tliev do not <11 11 < 11\
represent the artists — the true copv
right holders — but r.ithei the distribu
tors. Sec ond. etnbrac the radio assoc 1-
ation's stringent st.mdards would make
millions of Americans (riminals. (It is
worth noting that earliei copvright laws
regulating \ ideot.ipe cop\ tailed.) I 1-
nallv, the millions of < onsiunei sand po
tential copvright-inlringers lack the
funds and organisation to vnue theii
own concerns 111 the evolution ot intel

\ m.ijoi exteption to tins trend was
M IM.coni, whit It weathered law suit after
lawsuit to establish the right ol con
sumers to choose C Ds or Ml'Ss. No
doubt il the Recording ludustn \ssocia

sessing would be illegal. 01 at least
possess a stigma of ( riminalitv. B\ light

into MlV'is and pla\ them anywhere,
companies like Ml'S.com, Diamond
Multimedia (makers of the Rio portable

\apstei signified the next step
the right to distribute digit.il media
to w bomevei vou want. According to
the industiA "s view of intellectual
piopertv. Napster's services were
( ei tainly illegal.
Napstei might have losi 111 court (as n
nearl\ did), and intellet tual piopert\ law
would have continued most 1 \ un
changed since the time ol books, but if
Napstei had won. b\ showing that the
digital era should ( hange how ue look at
cop\ rights, then a legal revolution would
ha\e taken place.
Hut Napster made a deal with Bertels
mann. and David Boies went on to rep
-1 esent (>ore in the election lawsuits. I In
legal confrontation between Napster
and the industn is unlikclv to happen
now Napstei is part of the industry.
I Ins is good tor Napster and music
lovers everywhere. Soon, legal music
downloading and swapping will be al
lowed. making niusi< more a\ ailable and
(lieaper than ever before.
Who will be left to pic k up the torch
and battle the behemoths tor a new con
cept of digital intellectual property
lights- Main groups currently advocate
new ideas, groups ranging from the
Klectronit frontier Foundation to the
hat kei Web/ine 2600.
But despite having ttcniendous pop
nlaritx and the best lawyers money can
l>n\. Napster's best option was to step out
of the iing. It could he years before a
contender goes the distance.
