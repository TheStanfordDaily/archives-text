Letter reveals societal obsessions
v/itb sexuality
111 response to I'Q Shang's i omplaint
ot the natural assot iation ol "Wl 1()()I'S"
with "1 did it again," I tlnnk it not in
significant that a reader s eye is more
often drawn to a dictionan wort! than a
nonsense word like "MllOOI'S." It the
average Dail\ rcatlei chooses to prema
turely discontinue Ins 01 her reading
choice ater discovering that the article is
about the women's basketball team and
not Britney Spears, perhaps that is testa
ment to the breast-driven, male-cen
tered society to which the Stanford mi
crocosm is nt) exception. Furthermore,
Miss Spears does not pronounce
"whoops" but rather "oops."
