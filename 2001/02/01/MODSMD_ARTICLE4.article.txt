Stanford neurosc ientist Richard Sc hellet \n ill leave
the I niversity in March to become chief research ofli
cer at Genentec h, Inc. He will directast.ill of some 150
scientists once the company completes a 28(),()()()-
s(]tiare foot expansion .it its South S.m Frani'isco head
quarters — making it the world's largest biotechnolo
gy research lab.
Scheller cnrrentlv heads the lab at the Howard
Hughes Medical Institute. In a recent interview with
the San I-rancisc o( .hronicle, Sc hellet said he wasn't in
timidated In the contrast between running a 25-pei
son academic lab and directing C ienentec li s drug- dis
covery program.
"I don't think about the position in terms of pres
sure but in terms of what an exciting time it is to be a
life scientist." he said, citing the I finnan (ienome Pro
ject as one of mam advances helping scientists under
stand the mysteriesofdisea.se.
People who know and work with Sc heller — grad
uate students and colleagues at the molec ulai and c el -

1 11 lai |>h\ siologv lab — sa\ his enthusiasm lot science is
uncanm: lie has .in almost psychic ability to know
when Ins graduate students have finished conducting
a difficult experiment.
"You'll be walking down the hall with a set of [bio
logical! gels and he'll see \ou and say. 'Have \<>ii got
the results?' " said Karen Krvin, who has worked in
Scheller s lab fora decade. "It's almost as it he c an smell
data."
But it i-< tli.it vei v enthusiasm that tna\ prove one ol
Sc hellet's greatest < hallcnges at (ienentec h: balancing
excitement tor the sc ientilitalh fascinating against the
practicality of selecting projects with the- greatest po
tential of becoming marketable drugs.
"()ne of the most painful aspects of my job may be
turning aw.i\ from interesting science if the science
doesn't fit in with a business objective," Scheller said. "1
expect to have to make those decisions and I expect
them to be painful."
Ihe reality at Genentech closely approximates
Sc heller s assessment. In recent years, researchers at
the biotechnology firm have
worked on al>out 60 earlv stage
projects at any given time. I'hese
relatively cheap experiments 112( h us
on such topics as slow ing down the
progression of cancer or switching
oil a gene involved in heart disease.
The next stage attempts to
eliminate impractical projects. ()t
the ()0 early stage ideas, about 15
move on to the more costJy ani
mal-testing stage. Remedies that
prove too toxic, too expensive or

have too small a market are
scrapped.
Onlvtlneeoi tout projei t> eat h
vear are picked as candidates dur
ing human clinical trials. I his is a
si/cable commitment, because
putting a research project into
human tiials< an cost acompam as
much .is several hundred million
dollars as it ensures the prospective
drug is sate and useful.
Main people agree that
Scheller is suited fin the practical
and visional v aspects < >112 the |<>b.
"Ri( hard is one of the smartest,
most intuitive people I've evei
known, said C.ore\ (Goodman, a
neutosciencc professoi at I ('.-

Berkelev and Schcllei s colleague
in the earl\ 1980s. "He- has an in
credible instinc I tor good sc ienc e."
As he prepares tbi his careei it
Cenenlech, Sc heller said bis iiist
lask w ill be getting ac c|iiainied with
bis new research colleagues. He
expects ihe s» ientists al C >encntech
tobe nine b like the ones he woi ked
w itb at Stanford.
" I'lie coolest feeling in the
world, the thing.st ientists live toi. is
that moment when von under
stand something votive been
thinking about foi da\s or months
or years." Sc heller s.iul I believe
that strueal Sianlord.nicl I belieie
dial's true at (lencnlech."
