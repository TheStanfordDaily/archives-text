The two Dartmouth professors who
spent their lives, their careers and, ul
timately, their deaths
together . . . were remembered by
112 riends and colleagues as brilliant
minds who shared a passion for teach
ing, traveling and each other.
Susanne Zantop, chairwoman of
Dartmouth's German Studies Depart
ment, and her husband, Half a pro
fessor of earth sciences, were discov
ered dead in their home a few miles
off campus.
Susanne Zantop was 55. Her hus
band was 62.
Much of that conversation centered
on travel, friends said. Both natives of
Germany, the couple met at Stanford
University in California.
The couple, who became natural
ized U.S. citizens three years ago, con
tinued to travel the world, jointly lead
ing alumni cruises to Alaska, a col
league said.
