On (lie wall above m\ desk is a map of
the world. Its not quite what it
should be: (Greenland is colored
blue, and there's a large eountrv
called /aire sifting in the middle of Africa. Still,
it's a faiilv good approximation of global
geographv.
Maps are full of possibility; thev offer up
brightly colored visions of an explot able world.
Thev also rope it off with lines and labels.
I spend <i lot of time looking <it maps. (>n
family car trips, I commandeer the tiipnk. I
spend mv cross-country flights Irving to matt h
up the rivers and mountains out the window
with the maps in the back of the in-flight
magazine.
More thana vear ago, I went traveling alone
for the first time. 1 armed tnvself with a 11iit k
packet of maps: rail maps, t it\ maps, even to
pographical maps. I was prepared.
Two weeks into tin trip, m\ bat kpac k sinipU

refused to close. Something had to go. I
st lounged through m\ pack, looking to jetti
son some dead weight. I he first thing to go?
My maps.
Irutli is, they had been serving mainlv to
line tlu bottom of in\ pack. My best times had
tome from wandering the streets, from stop
ping into t hurt lies with no names and shops
wnit no signs. Ihe jov of unexpected discover
ies proved more memorable than the satisfac
tion of tour-book highlights.
W hen I took over as editor in chief of I he
Dailv, I drew mvself a map. It had dates and
times .is well as places; it was a blueprint of what
to< over and how to cover it. I put a calendar up
on the wall, and I tvpetl up list after list.
but somewhere along the line, I stopped re
iving on the plan. I didn't forget the map, but
I learned w hen to leave it in iiiy bottom draw
er. And I found, once again, that the best mo
ments are the unforeseen ones.

I lie stori*s and images that impressed me
most were the ones that came out of the blue.
Features about Brazilian martial arts and dolls
with leather pants. ()flensive tackles who com
pose music, and musicians with names like Dr.
Octagon and Pharcvde. And there was the
topsv-turvv election, a wild ride that had us
Hipping headlines until four in the morning.
So thank vou Stanford, for making nit' look
up from my map. Thanks for waking me up to
the unplanned and the unknown.
And thank vou to the superb Dailv stall for
sharing all those stories with me, and with the
rest of campus. I am ever struck by the talent
and dedication of the people who work at this
oflice. Because of vou, I looked forward to
coming into the oflice everv clav and to reading
over the paper everv night.
I am comforted to know that so many old
hands are stic king around, and that tlu- new
crop of editors, writers and photographers is

so talented and energetic. I leave this paper in
hands more capable than in\ own.
I expected to lie overwhelmed with sadness
as inv departure dav approached. But that day
is here, and inv eyes are drv. Yes, I will miss
editing The Dailv; I've loved (his job like noth
ing else I've done. But I'm not sad. I'm hope
ful. 1 have uncharted ground ahead oi me, and
I'll draw my map as I go.
