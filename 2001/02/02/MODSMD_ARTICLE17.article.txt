tli.it I think will prove instil -
monntahle, is th.it there are onl\
two teams that plav in the Super
Bowl, rhe World Series and tlx NBA Fi
nals. I'hird parties don't jive w ith Ainet i< a s
conception of the w.iv the game ol politics
works. It complicates the sc enariotoo mm h.
It makes for a confused spectatoi.
Imagine if the Philadelphia Katies (who
wear green, of ccnu se) had showed np at the
Super Bowl along with the Ravens and the

V * let I 11 >. I in \ until
the field. And, oddly,
they weren't even play
ing to win, l)ut onl\ to
store a few points. This
strategy doesn't work in
American football or
American politics.

• Bowl last Sunday. I he game was never
close. I here weren't am last-second touch
downs, no game saving tackles, no sudden
• death overtimes. In short, the game sin ked.
Personally. I was quite satislied with the
result. It meant that 1 wouldn't liavetolisten
to weeks of inane chatter about the game.
There is nothing so I mm ing to me as peo
ple talking .ibout professional sports. There
are few things so blatantly inconsequential
as abunchof menplavingagamconaHeld.
But there aren't tnanv things that people
spend as much time discussing.
I was talking with my friend Kail the
other dav, and 1 said, "Karl, don't von re
member when religion was the opiate of the
masses?"
"Indeed," he replied, "those were the
g(Mk1 old days."
Baseball nia\ Ik- the first national pas
time, but professional f<M)tball and basket
ball provide Americans with equally attrac
tive diversions. And 1 don't mean playing
baseball, football or basketball. I mean
watching it or reading about it. I mean talk
ing and thinking alxuit it.
There is no place in this country where
you can't pick up a newspajx'i or turn on a
television and spend vour time following a
game. There are very few places where you
can't find a group of |>eople sitting around
nearby talking alxxit the latest victory , de
feat, trade, scandal, coaching decision or
player convicted of murder.
Some of the coverage is absolutely bril
liant. I am constantly surprised by the pro
found insight offered by suc h pundits as
Peter Gammons and ('.litis Berman. Simi
larly, there are a lot of great sjxMts writers

out there, making sense of the minutiae of
plaving games and getting paid foi it.
Sports media are so good, in fact, that
real newst overage ol events thai have some
soit of consequence is often |nst .» pale
imitation.
Kvcn the hest political shows hoi row
heavih from sports tcrminologv. Ihe tall
< ainpaign was a singles!. It went down tot lie
wire. I here u.is a photo finish. We almost
needed |ndgc Mills Line there .it the end.
I he result of all this sports (overage is
that the important contests in America,
those that will affe( t out li\cs and the lives of
<>iii children, .ire frighteningh similai to
sports ( ontcsts.
Spotts teams don't cooperate with ea< h
otliei hevotul agreeing to adhere to the
same rules .is the\ tr\ to defeat eat h otliei
|ohn M< (lain and Rnss Keingold are trving
once again to work togcthci with the most
recent version ol then campaign fin.iiut
reform hill.
I'hc hill's prospects lot success snffei from
the fat t that the pnhlit is l.irgch ignor.mt on
the issue. ( ainpaign finance reform h.is bi
p.irtisan support and bipartisan oppostion.
It doesn't lit niceh into the opposition.il di
chototm of the sport of professional
legislating.
I he whole thing is too complex, even fdt
main Stanford students. As .i Democrat
wht» supports (ainpaign finante reform, 1
have two hi impel st i< kei s on the back of m\
c.u. ()ne s.ivs "M( (lain L'OOO" and the otliei
sa\s"( lore 2()()()." People look at me like I'm
we.ii ing a Stanford sweatshii I and a (la I hat.
But, I sav, and this a crucial distinction,
politics is not .i sport. Life is not a game.
When things happen in life, there are con
sequences. When elections are decided in
politics, there are t onse<|iiences.
(leorgc W. Bnsh and his cabinet have
real powet. and he was given that power In
the voters, the arcane Klectoral (lollcge and
the favor of the I nited States Supreme
Court. All of onr elected officials have real
power over onr lives, real power to shape
the future.
Rav Ixwis, Super Bowl MVP, has, at
most, the power to increase the sales of
(latorade tor a couple months, if lie decides
to do the endorsement thing.
Recently we've had a verv exciting elec
tion and a horriblv lx)ring football game. I
can only hope that these events form a sig
nal of things to come. Americans mav start
paving attention to contests that really mat
ter, and not to men plaving games.
