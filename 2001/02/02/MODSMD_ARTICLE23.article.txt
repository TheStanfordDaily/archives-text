two weekends, though, will not be

hitters respond against what I
think will be the best pitching
we've seen." Marquess said.
I'he younger hitters did not
have iiiikli trouble adjusting to
the pitching in Fresno State last
weekend, as freshman Cl.ulos
Oucntin hit a home run in Ins first
collegiate at-bat, and freshman
Brian 11 all atldetl one of Ins own.
Stanford finished the three-game
series last week with six home
i litis.
Fhe strength of the ('.ardiiial of
fense was untested before last I i i
tlav's game with the bulldogs.
I fowcvei, by the end <>l the lii st in
ning, the (lartlinal offense was able
to demonstrate its firepowei and
silence criticism. "It stored seven
first-inning runs, and looked more
like last year's offensive unit in the
prt>t ess.
"I don't know if we can expect
that [firepower] all the time. It's
hard to sav," Marquess said.

Another problem lot Marquess
oyei the p.isi two weeks li.is been
finding spots foi .ill of Ins |>'.i\t-1 s
in the lineup because lie w.nits to
see lit>w all of his pi.ivers will tlo in
game situations. In ortlei to get a
leel lot the abilities and potential
of Ins plavers, he experimented
with the lineup and tried players
m several different positions ovei
the weekend.
