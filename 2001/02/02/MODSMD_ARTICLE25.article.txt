Alter a l.isi start to the 2001 season and with two
ot its least threatening opponents on tap lor tins
weekend, the Stanford men's volleyball team could
have taken this week's training easier than usual.
But alter a . r )-0 start to the season, iik hiding three
big conference wins over No. I IVpperdine, No. 2
U(. Santa Barbara and No. II Cal State-North

pace.

It is difficult to imagine what an expanded offen

Alter a l.isi start to the 2001 season and with two
ot its least threatening opponents on tap lor tins
weekend, the Stanford men's volleyball team could
have taken this week's training easier than usual.
But alter a . r )-0 start to the season, iik hiding three
big conference wins over No. I IVpperdine, No. 2
U(. Santa Barbara and No. II Cal State-North
ridge, the Stanford sc|tiad is not readv to slow its
pace.
"We've .ill been going hard in practice," said
sophomore outside hittei Will Cuius. "We want to
carry our momentum from the last few wins with us
into this weekend's man lies
I"he Cardinal, whit li moved up tv\o spots to No. 2
in this week's AV( A ('.oat lies poll, takes on (Califor
nia in .111 exhibition match tonight at 7 p.m. iu
Maples Pavilion. I"he team then heads down to I (1-
Santa Cm/ tomorrow foi a non-conference matt li
against the 1 )iv. 111 No. 5 Banana Slugs (I -7).
With neither the Bears nor I CSC posing a seri
ous threat, the (Cardinal lias the chant e to test some

offensive tat tit s that it's worked on in prat tice, in ad
dition to providing substantial playing time tor its
kev substitutes.
"We got some good things done in practice this
week, spet ilit allv for the nuitt lies this weekend and
for things that will help us throughout the season,"
saitl head coach Ruben Nieves. "We've been incor
porating some plays that we haven't used much so
tar this season."
It is difficult to imagine what an expanded offen
sive arsenal could do for Stanford. I he Cardinal is
already hitting an incredible .413 this season and
outkilling its opponents bv an average margin of al
most loin kills per game.
"We've been able to work on making the team
more well-rounded this week," saitl sophomore out
side hitter Curt I'oppel, who is averaging a team
high 5.29 kills per game. "It gives us more options
tor matt lies down the road il someone is oil in a
match."
I lie exhibition matt h against (Cal gives Stanford a
t liant e to spread playing time across the entire ros
ter, .tiitl the team will likeh experiment with a dif
ferent starting lineup tonight.
Nieves will probablv start Curtis, a kev reserve at
outside hitter, and will give senioi Setli King, the
team's usual starting lihero, a < liant e at outside hitter.
"We want Will ( Curtis to get some time at outside
hitter," Nieves saitl. "We want to linn some time
with [senioi |<>sli| l.ukens at settei and mi situations
where he would tome in il it were a regulai league
match."
Sophomores Paul Bot age and k\le Strat'lie, who
have played important roles toi the (Cardinal oft the
bent li this season, niav start at the two middle blot k
er spots.
