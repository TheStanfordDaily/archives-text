I'hey may Ik- far from the comforts of Maples Pavil
ion .m<l playing two teams quite capable of an upset,
but one thing is certain: wins over I ( I _ \ and I SC ! are
im|K'iative for the Stanford women's l>asketb<ill team
(Ins weekend it thev want to remain in tin-11 tit kol the
Pacific 10 (lonference rate.
After .i 1-3 start to conference plav, the Cardinal
(10-7 overall) is riding the momentum of three
straight winsth.it have brought n one game out ot first
plate in the conference rate. With far-10 leaders,
Oregon, Ari/ona and Ari/ona State l>eating up on
each (>ther this weekend, Stanford tould easily find it
self .it the top the conference standings if it can tally
two more wins.
"We are plaving well defensiveh ant I we are re-
IxHinding well," said head coach I'ara VanlkTveci.
"We've got some momentum going, and we have
Ix'en able to gel oui liearitigs a bit."
However, I)oth I C.LVantl I SC'. (8-9, .'M Pac-10)
have other things on their minds. I lie bi uins and ilie
I rojans struggled in the opening weeks of conference
pla\ but have shown in receni weeks I hat the\ are ca
pable of beating ami>ne.
I S(. has been a ((>nleience |H>werht >use in the past
weeks, completing a road sweep of ()regon and ()re
gon Stale last weekend, and blowing past Ari/ona at
home the weekend betoie.
Meanwhile, the Hi inns have shown the\ are capa
ble of the upset and have beaten the Women of I rov
and the Wilt It als.
I he kev to eat li of the games for the ('.artlinal will
be maintaining the poise it displayed last weekentl
against the Washington m hools. Stanford has plavcd
well at home all \e.ii but holds a l-(i recortl in roatl
plav.
Vanl)ci"veer is the lirst one to dismiss the roatl jinx.
"We <>b\ k »usl\ liave to cam out < <mfidence on the
roatl." said VanDcivcer. "but l(H)king at the plates
where we have liecn plav ing and how well we have
plavcd, w bethel it isa two-point game ill Tennessee or
.in overtime game m ()klahoma. we have plavcd, and
that is what we need to do."
