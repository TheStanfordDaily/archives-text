### JOHN SHASHANMI 
A carnival? At Stanford? Believe it or
not it happens even vear. Sophomores
Shoshannah Met/ and Jennifer Roof are
planning to make it happen this veat. The
two were recently named co-directors of
the group that puts on the Stanford ( om
munitv ( '.arnival, an event that will bring
more than .">OO elementary s< hool stu
dents to Wilbur Field for .1 day of fun on
Ma> 12.
l he carnival has had much success
since its inception in 1985 and barring
lain nothing should put a damper on the
fun this year.
"My favorite part [of the whole
process) is the carnival day itself (letting
prepared gets stress)fill]," said Met/. "But

on the dav of the event, vou reali/e how
what vou did is making the kids so happv.
It's just ama/ing to see how little things
that we take for granted are so appreciat
ed by them."
I he ( arnival is an annual public-ser
vice event run through the Haas center.
Kach year, between 300 and 1.000 ele
mentary school students from l ast Palo
Alto and Kast Menlo Park are invited to
the campus for the festivities.
I he goal of the carnival is to provide a
safe day of fun and entertainment for the
children and to give them an opportunity
to interact with positive role models. The
carnival's organizers hope that the event
w ill inspire Stanford students to work with
the children of the l<x al communities.
Planning for this year's carnival

began with I lit* selection of Met/ and
Roof a> co-directors. I hev will begin the
first part of 'their job on Monday when
thev hold a general information meeting
at S p.m. in the Haas Outer's Donald
Kenncdv room.
1 he meeting will allow interested stu
dents to ask any questions they may have
and topi< k ii|>applications for the 20 to 25
committee positions th.it are available.

lected, thev will be divided into subcom
mittees responsible for organizing differ
