The story
is told predominately
through the experiences of the co
founders of the movement, 13-year-old
Steven (lozza and 70-year-old Dave Rice -
both heterosexual, dedicated to the Scouts
and determined to change the course ol
scouting history.
For Rice, who has been involved with
m outing lor several decades, it was the legal
cases of the ousted scouts Tim (airran and
|aines Dale that motivated him to become
involved, as well as a deep-seated belief in
the Scout's spirit ol fairness.
"I've had hundreds of stouts come up
through the ranks. My first Eagle Scout,
who is now 111 his 30s, just c ame out," said
Rice. "I am hurting Ixvause ol all those
bovs who must have been gay but were
afraid to talk about it."
(lozza said it was respect lor his church
camp counselor, an openly ga\ man, that
pi it him to the task.
"I hope the lilm helps the cause." s.iid
C-oz/a. "I was really young when I decided
to take a stand and started handing out a
petition .it Luc k\ s (the local grocery store).
1 wrote .1 whole lot ol letters. And the issue
otiickh received national attention."

Ilie film is also about a c oining ot age.
|usi as (loz/.a's maturation is documented
by die three-year project, Sliepard hopes
dial society will mature and change in its
acceptance of homosexuals.
"As you can see in the film, he got a
tremendous amount <>l response from the
media and people around him. i le basical
ly grows upon screen. And when you're 1-
years of age, its hard to gel young people
to express their feelings, lo me it was |iist

Steven's father, Scott (10/./a,

nearly three \'ears. it u.is essential to ignore

I'heir campaign, which began quieth in
their hometown ol Pet alt una, has evolved
into an international grassroots petition
di i\e .ind media campaign to overt til n the
Hoy Stouts ol Ainet it a's anti-ga) policy.
The film chronicles (ioz/a's and Rh e's trav

liances iu gay churches, at parades and in
meetings with gav youth. "Stout's I lonor"
reveals the* haracters' deepening commit

"I wanted to create a message tli.it every

('.o//a. who started a gav / straight alliance
at his high school last year. "Kveryone

Along the way, I hey nieel gav scouts
such as l im Curran, who was ousted from
the Bo\ Scouts at the age ol IH in 1080 and
|ames Dale, a 20-year-old LagleSunit who
sued the Boy Stouts after he too was dis

Daniel |ackson said, "I thought

Hut most of all. Shepard is concerned
with reaching communities across the

I tilled States. " The next six months are

Furthei he states, "legally this may be a

from the organization. Preserving the in

what tins film is really about."
So what's next for Shepard and "Scout's
Honor"? "Scout's Honor" will most likely
be shown at the Miami Clay and Lesbian
Film Festival in April and the San Frant is
co International Film Festival in May. Se

And be on the lookout—"Scout's

At the sold out screening, a sea ol pink

handing them out at the beginning of the
iilm, Shepard asked Dave Rice, one ol the
principle charac tei sin the liltn and fonnei

The story
is told predominately
through the experiences of the co
founders of the movement, 13-year-old
Steven (lozza and 70-year-old Dave Rice -
both heterosexual, dedicated to the Scouts
and determined to change the course ol
scouting history.
For Rice, who has been involved with
m outing lor several decades, it was the legal
cases of the ousted scouts Tim (airran and
|aines Dale that motivated him to become
involved, as well as a deep-seated belief in
the Scout's spirit ol fairness.
"I've had hundreds of stouts come up
through the ranks. My first Eagle Scout,
who is now 111 his 30s, just c ame out," said
Rice. "I am hurting Ixvause ol all those
bovs who must have been gay but were
afraid to talk about it."
(lozza said it was respect lor his church
camp counselor, an openly ga\ man, that
pi it him to the task.
