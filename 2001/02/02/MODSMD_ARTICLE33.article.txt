Intermission: How long have you
been with K/Sl ?
Mike 11 owes: I' 2 years.
I: Wow. That's a long time. How
have you seen the station change
over the wars?
Ml I: ()h m\ ... a huge question. I n
its history, K/,SI has gone
through three major changes,
first, we switched to KM (long he
lore I was even horn). I hen, in the
mid (ids. we switched from pri
marih classical and ja// to rot k.
and finally, in the early '90s, we
slopped plaving lots ol crapp\ das
sit rot k and ja// and starl ing ail ing
all different kinds of music that
weren't played on commercial
radio. Now, there aren't borders
on what we'll play — literally thou
sands of dillerent stvlcs ol music
Irom .ill over the world.
Alter the big change in the earh
00s. the station has gone through
some smaller changes. All K/Sl
l)|s are volunteers who have to
earn then radio slots In helping
1 mi the station. And man) ol those
volunteers are students, so we see a

lot ol I>| turnover. I Ins

I: How.did you get involved with
college radio?
Mil: I've always loved music, but
grew up in a place were there was
ho good radio (no 11011 < 0111 hick lal
radio at all) and reall) nohod\ who
liked anything bin mainstream
ji 111 k. I'hen.when I went to college,
I discovered the school's station
,iii(l was in awe that there was radio
that played diflerent kinds of
music. I knew aftet just 30 minutes
of listening that I wanted to take
part. I got involved onl\ to find out
th.it most <>l the stall .it tli.it st.itioii
were |iist as closed-minded as com
mercial I >) s, but with the genre ol
music the\ liked. I was not given .1
show. I promised mvsell to find
and or help (1 eate .1 station with .1
more open atmosphere about dil
lerent musical genres and sounds.
I: Win do \<>u think it's important
that radio stations like K/.SI exist?
Mil Commercial radio, most
majot internet radio st.itw>l is. and
music IV pla\ less than 1 percent
ol .ill the nmsK that's put out. First
,md foremost I think it's important
that there he an outlet foi theothci
W-plus-petcent of the music that

ex
ists. However, it's even more im
portant lor a radio station to be
part ol the t oniniuuilN in which it
exists. I bis tan mean a varielv ol
things: a plate lot community
members to voice opinions, a place
lor members ol (lie t omiiiunitv to
announce events, a place lot sot ial
and political discussions, a place
lot people lo leai n about radio and
a plate for anything someone
wants tt> tlt>. As the famed band
Negativland sa\s in theii own
radio promt), "C.ontrai) to popu
lar opinion, it has not been det itletl
what radio should be." Lastly,
musii shows t an be more than just
a jukebox, ('.teating a music show
t an bet otne an art lortn. I his hap
pens when a l>| puis dillerent
st)untling music together, mixes,
gives information about bands,
in.ikes announcements or shares
her humor with the community.
