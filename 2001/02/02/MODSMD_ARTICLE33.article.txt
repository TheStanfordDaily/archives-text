Intermission: How long have you
been with K/Sl ?
Mike 11 owes: I' 2 years.
I: Wow. That's a long time. How
have you seen the station change
over the wars?
Ml I: ()h m\ ... a huge question. I n
its history, K/,SI has gone
through three major changes,
first, we switched to KM (long he
lore I was even horn). I hen, in the
mid (ids. we switched from pri
marih classical and ja// to rot k.
and finally, in the early '90s, we
slopped plaving lots ol crapp\ das
sit rot k and ja// and starl ing ail ing
all different kinds of music that
weren't played on commercial
radio. Now, there aren't borders
on what we'll play — literally thou
sands of dillerent stvlcs ol music
Irom .ill over the world.
Alter the big change in the earh
00s. the station has gone through
some smaller changes. All K/Sl
l)|s are volunteers who have to
earn then radio slots In helping
1 mi the station. And man) ol those
volunteers are students, so we see a

I: How.did you get involved with
college radio?
Mil: I've always loved music, but
grew up in a place were there was
ho good radio (no 11011 < 0111 hick lal
radio at all) and reall) nohod\ who
liked anything bin mainstream
ji 111 k. I'hen.when I went to college,
I discovered the school's station
,iii(l was in awe that there was radio
that played diflerent kinds of
music. I knew aftet just 30 minutes
of listening that I wanted to take
part. I got involved onl\ to find out
th.it most <>l the stall .it tli.it st.itioii
were |iist as closed-minded as com
mercial I >) s, but with the genre ol
music the\ liked. I was not given .1
show. I promised mvsell to find
and or help (1 eate .1 station with .1
more open atmosphere about dil
lerent musical genres and sounds.
I: Win do \<>u think it's important
that radio stations like K/.SI exist?
Mil Commercial radio, most
majot internet radio st.itw>l is. and
music IV pla\ less than 1 percent
ol .ill the nmsK that's put out. First
,md foremost I think it's important
that there he an outlet foi theothci
W-plus-petcent of the music that

ex
ists. However, it's even more im
portant lor a radio station to be
part ol the t oniniuuilN in which it
exists. I bis tan mean a varielv ol
things: a plate lot community
members to voice opinions, a place
lor members ol (lie t omiiiunitv to
announce events, a place lot sot ial
and political discussions, a place
lot people lo leai n about radio and
a plate for anything someone
wants tt> tlt>. As the famed band
Negativland sa\s in theii own
radio promt), "C.ontrai) to popu
lar opinion, it has not been det itletl
what radio should be." Lastly,
musii shows t an be more than just
a jukebox, ('.teating a music show

Jacki-O. a former Stanford stu
dent, co-hosts the Big Lo\e show,
every Monday from .'i to 6 p.m.
Intermission: flow long have you
been involved with KZSU?
|at ki-(): I've been involved off and
011 with K/SL fora while now. A
little bit .is a freshman the late \SOs,
as an avid listener and a close
friend of a D|. and I hung around
the station a bit. Then in '92 to '94
I was involved with the first show
that would showcase electronic
dante music from the earh days of
the SI- underground "rave" st ene,
featuring D|-mixed thuinpin' ac id
house and techno beats. It was .1
< omplcteh new sound then, and
we were one of the first shows 111
the Ba\ Area to present the sound
from that scene. I hen, I re-joined
the station in late '97. In )iuie '99 I
revived the elec tronic dance-music
format, mixed In top B.n Area
D|s, going strong until now.
1: Where do you find the guests for
the Bis; Love show?
|<): I've partied to the first-ever
I>.l s w ho spun house-music / at id
house tec hno in San Francisco
since 1990. 111 those d.ns. 1 got to
know some of the D|s who were
the pioneers of house music 111 SI
(and around the woi Id). So. a lot
of the Djson my show are people
that I know personally and/or
friends of friends. Various SL
club managers and part\ promot
ers are also people that I've run
into, and the\ w ill often introduce
D|s to me.
It depends on who is in town
and whether the\ are able to pl.n
011 Monti.ns. 01 get a ride to Stan
ford from SK (which is a big c hal
lenge). I essentialh run a tlub gig
on nn show even Monti.n. and In
having a diflerent D) each week,
each show has a different sound.
But. it's a < hallenge, to go tint and

hit tlu' clubs and parties, make* the
phone < alls. send the e-mails and
book I)|s each week.
I: ('..in you give the Intermission
readers some information about
what is going on in I lit- electronica
scene these da\s?
|(): Ihe scene has ( hanged a lot in
the last 10 years, and moreover,
ilit- musical styles are constantly
evolving. There are so many
artists, so many styles, so many
record labels, it's impossible to
track it .ill.
Another factor is the people
who go to a rave, drop an "K." and
"discover electronic music" and
think that what they've heard, the
high-energy aerobic i/.er-trance
and 150 lil'M "hard-house"
(which isn't "house" at all) is it. Now
the\ II buy 100 drum and bass or
trance records and then call them
selves a DJ.
Most ol the- l)|s I host on tin
show have been involved with the
Sf dance-music scene lor a decade,
working with hip-hop, '80s, disco,
ja//, 11111k and so on, in addition to
playing house. Mans were pio
neers in this music and also pro
duce- it. It's important to respect
the history of electronic music and
its evolution, from Detroit tec hno
to NYC garage to I...V breakbeat to
SF progt essive.
You shouldn't be into just one
type of elect route alh-driven
sound at one particular tempo. I
always tell my listeners: )iist go out
to the clubs that 1 regularly pro
mote on my show. (>o to the local
d.uiee-niusic stores, not lower
Records, to find vour electronic
music. Find l))s that spin the type
ol music that you like best. Find
out what record-labels produce
the stufl you like. Mv guest I)| s
play "deep" (soulful R&B vocals),
"lunkv" (funky b.isslines and
grooves), "latin-y" (congas and
horns), "progressive" (instrumen
tal stuff with tweaky electronic
sample's), "acid" (druggy tweaks),
and so much more.
