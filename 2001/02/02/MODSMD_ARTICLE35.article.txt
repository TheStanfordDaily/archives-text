# The 						Moon and Antarctica
## This is a long drive from Seattle for a very Modest Mouse 
### KIM SAMEK 
When I llrst heard Modest
Mouse's " Hie Moon and Antarc
tic a,'' I was standing in a Holly
wood apartment oil Sunset
boulevard amid a sin.ill gather
ing ol friends. Someone who had
received an advance copy of the
CD slipped it in at the request ol
.1 member ol the rap-rock group
/ebrahead. Hearing Isaac
Brock's uninistakabh distinct vo
cals till the room, 1 was taken In
surprise. Ilie hand that onh a
few vears ago played down the
street from me for small crowds
ol teenagers was creating .1 bti//
in L.A.?
Although Modest Mouse is
very talented, I'm always sur
prised to run into their fans out
side of Seattle. They sell out
crowds of 2-3,000 consistently on
their tours. At their last show in
the Bav Area, supporting their
|une 2000 release of "The Moon
8c \ntarctica," they sold out two
nights at the Warfield well in ad
vance. Pretty impressive fora
small hand from Issaquah, Wash.
They released their first lull
length album, "This is a Long
hi ive for Someone With Nothing
to think About'' on Ip in 199(i,
following it up with the 1997 gem
I he Lonesome, Crowded West,"
and the 1999 release "Build
Nothing out of Something." In
addition to Brock, the band
boasts Kric fudy (bass) and Jere
miah Green (drums).
Modest Mouse proves that
bands can rely on the quality of
their music to be successful, tran
scending mainstream radio air
play and MTV. Although "The
Moon & Antarctica" marks Mod
est Mouse's major label debut,
they have continued to do well
with virtually no promotional
work.
While the album shows a clear
evolution from the tninitnalistic,
raw, we-recorded-this-on-our
four-trac k-in-our-basement feel
ing to a more elegant, produced
sound, the band still maintains

.ind cultivates its originality. Ihe
album is loaded with l. r > distinct
tracks, each of which moves the
listener forward through Isaac
Brock's sometimes terrifvingh
moving emotional landsc ape.
I he beauty ol the album lies in
Modest Mouse's .ibilit\ to weave
together dark, crafty guitar woi k.
into simple, intricately layered
eight minute operas. Lac h song
takes on its own character, from
"Paper Phiii Walls" reminiscent
of the hook-oriented older al
bums. to the fiink\ bass line pre
vailing throughout one ol the

Modest Mouse
Hie Moon and

"Was There
A Need For
Creation?"

album's standouts, " liny (ities
Made Of Ashes." In the latter,
Krock explores the themes ot the
oppressive urban lilestvle and the
band's newfound success. Juxta
posing absurd lyrics such .is "So
we're drinkin drinkin drinkin
drinkin coca-coca-cola / 1 can feel
it rollin on down / Oh right
on down my throat," with the
equally bizarre but insightful,
"We're gonna get dressed up in
plastic / (ionna shake hands with
the masses."
"Tiny Cities" moves smoothly
into the next track, "A Different
C".itv," in which he continues to
explore the themes of urban
alienation. "I wanna remember to
remember to forget you forgot
me / I'm gonna look out the win

clow of m\ color I \ .
As rich lis ihe album is in com
plexity, "The Moon & \ntarcti
ca's" greatest achievement lies in
its Ivrical content. I nlike albums
past, which lot used mot e on the
slot \ telling of lives around
Brock, it speaks to .1 longing, re
vealing a surprising tenderness in
his youthful lisp\ voice. In "Life
Like Weeds, (one <>l the album's
epic standouts). Brock quieth
mentions:
All this t.ilkm' all (lie time and
the air tills up, up, up I mil
there's nothin' left to breathe/'
And you think you feel most
everything And we know that
our hearts are just made out of
strings fo be pulled, strings to
be pulled / So \ou think vou've
figured out everything Bui we
know that our minds
are lust made out of

strings
Ile lias a knack
foi dressing Ins woes
in beautiful lines ol
st ream-of-conscious
ness. Ihe album
thrives 011 moments
siu li .is this, 111 which
vou feel privileged to
be listening to his
deepest secrets. In

the eight-minute journey of" I he
Stars are Projectors," he asks,
"Was there a need for creation?
I h.it was hidden in a math equa
tion And that's this... Where do
circles begin?" The question
posed presents the motif of the
album — a riddle, fhe cover de
picts two blue hands they refuse
to explain, daring us to figure
them out.
I can safely say that this is a
band who cannot be compared to
any other. II you've been dying
for something completely origi
nal, if you consider yourself a per
son who has any appreciation for
music, if you enjoy quality music
and sincerity, you should do
yourself a favor and check out
"The Moon and Antarctica."

When I llrst heard Modest
Mouse's " Hie Moon and Antarc
tic a,'' I was standing in a Holly
wood apartment oil Sunset
boulevard amid a sin.ill gather
ing ol friends. Someone who had
received an advance copy of the
CD slipped it in at the request ol
.1 member ol the rap-rock group
/ebrahead. Hearing Isaac
Brock's uninistakabh distinct vo
cals till the room, 1 was taken In
surprise. Ilie hand that onh a
few vears ago played down the
street from me for small crowds
ol teenagers was creating .1 bti//
in L.A.?
Although Modest Mouse is
very talented, I'm always sur
prised to run into their fans out
side of Seattle. They sell out
crowds of 2-3,000 consistently on
their tours. At their last show in
the Bav Area, supporting their
|une 2000 release of "The Moon
8c \ntarctica," they sold out two
nights at the Warfield well in ad
vance. Pretty impressive fora
small hand from Issaquah, Wash.
They released their first lull
length album, "This is a Long
hi ive for Someone With Nothing
to think About'' on Ip in 199(i,
following it up with the 1997 gem
I he Lonesome, Crowded West,"
and the 1999 release "Build
Nothing out of Something." In
addition to Brock, the band
boasts Kric fudy (bass) and Jere
miah Green (drums).
Modest Mouse proves that
bands can rely on the quality of
their music to be successful, tran
scending mainstream radio air
play and MTV. Although "The
Moon & Antarctica" marks Mod
est Mouse's major label debut,
they have continued to do well
with virtually no promotional
work.
While the album shows a clear
evolution from the tninitnalistic,
raw, we-recorded-this-on-our
four-trac k-in-our-basement feel
ing to a more elegant, produced
sound, the band still maintains

.ind cultivates its originality. Ihe
album is loaded with l. r > distinct
tracks, each of which moves the
listener forward through Isaac
Brock's sometimes terrifvingh
moving emotional landsc ape.
I he beauty ol the album lies in
Modest Mouse's .ibilit\ to weave
together dark, crafty guitar woi k.
into simple, intricately layered
eight minute operas. Lac h song
takes on its own character, from
"Paper Phiii Walls" reminiscent
of the hook-oriented older al
bums. to the fiink\ bass line pre
vailing throughout one ol the

Creation?"

album's standouts, " liny (ities
Made Of Ashes." In the latter,
Krock explores the themes ot the
oppressive urban lilestvle and the
band's newfound success. Juxta
posing absurd lyrics such .is "So
we're drinkin drinkin drinkin
drinkin coca-coca-cola / 1 can feel
it rollin on down / Oh right
on down my throat," with the
equally bizarre but insightful,
"We're gonna get dressed up in
plastic / (ionna shake hands with
the masses."
"Tiny Cities" moves smoothly
into the next track, "A Different
C".itv," in which he continues to
explore the themes of urban
alienation. "I wanna remember to
remember to forget you forgot
me / I'm gonna look out the win

clow of m\ color I \ .
As rich lis ihe album is in com
plexity, "The Moon & \ntarcti
ca's" greatest achievement lies in
its Ivrical content. I nlike albums
