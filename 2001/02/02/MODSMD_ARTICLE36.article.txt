"Not a Virgin" (which resem

"I lannted" is a giant leap from

standouts such as the title track
(which resembles a less angelic
Dido) and "Could've (lone

"I've been in liei house/ I've ex

album.)
In spite ol being thoroughly
cross-referenced with the album,
this critically acclaimed book is
even more metaphorical than
"Haunted," and only the
Danielewskis know the full extent
of their story. I'oe, for one, seems
to have found peace through the
experience, as the album ends
with the tender "If Von Were
