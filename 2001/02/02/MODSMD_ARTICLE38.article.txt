Despite Slug's solid perfor
mance, the deal si.ll ol the show
was Iwedea, who has gained in
creasing recognition since his \u

2000."
('.onmionU viewed as a hi illiant
freest vler hut mediocre song
writer, the 10-\ear-old emcee
proved thai the lattet is not the
case. Included in his repertoire
were "Murdet of Memories, a
moving tale of a Vietnam veteran,
and "Big Shot, a song about a too
cool emcee thai turns out to be
himself.
I lie showstopper, however,

Although their versatilitN is
