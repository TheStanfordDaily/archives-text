# Students seek cheap books

### WILL OREMUS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
People sin in I hen scuts, glancing at (heir
watt lies as thev uwuit Ihe end of lecture. I he
professor raises her voice to he heard above
all the rustling, announcing that anyone
needing a svllubns should pick one tip .it the
front after ( lass.
As students rise to leave, a new voice rings
out above the din: " Texthooks, cheap, get
'em right here." Most glance brieflv at the
shady-looking vendor and continue on their
wuy, hut a few stop to investigate, wondering
if the\ might save money over the Stanford
Bookstore's seemingly exorbitunt prices.
With textbook costs fora single tjuurter
totaling more than $500 for some human bi
ologv majors and at least $200 for the aver
age student, the desire to find a lesscostlv al
ternative is understandable.
I he Bookstore's prices are competitive
when compared to online outlets and othci
booksellers. I'll row in the store's automatic?
percent student discount, and its prices on
most new books actually beat most competi
tors In a few dollars. But the perception re
mains that somewhere, somehow, books
should be cheaper.
A group of Stanford undergraduates is
working on a pro jet t that, if'successful, could
slash production and distribution costs and
muybe even revolutioni/e the industry.
Akush Jain, a sophomore, leads a team of
four former dot inmates who are competing
in the BASKS c-chullcngc with an itlcu for an
electronic textbook device. Along with
sophomores Murk Jong, Kli Vun Allen and
Jon McAlistcr. |uin conducted an online sur
vey to determine whether there is sufficient
interest to justify the undertaking.

More than 500 students have responded
to the survey .it http://ebook.stanford.edu,
with .1 majority indicating that they would be
interested in buying hardware at an up
front cost of up to $300 ii it could save them
.i significant amount on future textbook
pun liases.
According to Jain, the team's product
would allow students to buv all of their text
books online at reduced costs. They would
Ik- able to download them onto a single lap
top-sized gadget called an e-book via their
computer's Internet connection. E-books
would save trees and increase convenience
while all but eliminating production and dis
tribution costs, which currently constitute
approximately HO percent of the price of
textbc >oks.
The question is not whether people will
buy e-books, but when the frenzy will begin.
"Analysts have predicted that it will be
come a billion-dollar market in the next five
to 10 vears," noted Jong. "Textbooks are
currentlv about a Sb-billion industry, and it's
expected that e-books will eventually ac
count for between 0 and 10 percent of that
number.''
Don't expect to see the team's product
hitting the shelves anvtime soon, though.
While |ain said that "the real goal is the
formation of a company," he admitted that
the group's work so fat has consisted mainly
of market research.
"The biggest problem is security," Jain
said. "Publishers aren't going to want a
book Napster' where texts are available for
free all over the Internet."
I he team is working on a plan that would
prevent buvers from making their purchas-
