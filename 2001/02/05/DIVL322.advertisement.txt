urious about your sexual
fantasies, attractions, and
behavior? Interested in intimacy
We all are. Being sexually attracted
to another person is an exciting
experience that can be sensual,
physical and/or emotional. It
embodies a wide range of feelings
including affection, tenderness,
love, pride, possessiveness, jeal
ousy and fear.
Attitudes
Our attitudes toward sex are often
influenced bv messages we
received growing up. Consider:
■ How adults expressed emo
tional and physical affection
around you
■ The way adults differed in their
sexual behavior based on their
gender
■ What early messages you
received about sex (verbal
and non-verbal)
■ The position of your religion
and attitude of your culture
toward sex
Differences
just as we all had different
experiences growing up, we also
approach sexuality differently.
Preferences for how, when, and
with whom we want to be sexual
vary, as does what turns us on
and turns us off. So does our
level of desire: some people are
easily aroused and would like to
have sex more; others less. People
also attribute different meanings
to sexual thoughts, feelings, and
behaviors, and what we consider
"normal" varies significantly.
Sexual Fantasy
Fantasy is a common, normal
psychological process. It also
serves a purpose: it enables us to

explore things internally that we
may decide not to act upon.
Sexual fantasies:
■ Are a means of exploration
■ Help us escape from the
frustrations of daily life
■ Enable us to rehearse situ
ations, and so can boost our
self-confidence
■ Are useful in solitary situations
■ Can enhance an intimate
relationship
Recognize that your fantasies
may cause you some discomfort.
They may conflict with esta
blished values, seem outlandish
or exaggerated when viewed
rationally, or they may represent
just one part of yourself (but one
that is important not to ignore).
When Sex Isn't
Rewarding
At one time or another (and
sometimes often), you may have
difficulty enjoying yourself in an
intimate sexual relationship.
This can occur fora variety of
reasons, such as:
■ Having difficulty feeling
good about yourself or your
partner
■ Being troubled by the
circumstances of the sexual
experience
■ Drugs and alcohol: they can
have side effects that affect
your sexual interest or
performance
■ Sex can be painful (if you
have physical discomfort
during sex, consult a
physician)
