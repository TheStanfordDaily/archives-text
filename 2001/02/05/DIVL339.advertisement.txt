Social scientists reported the
discovery of a cave dwelling popula
tion trying to establish a colony on
land adjacent to Stanford Federal
Credit Union on Page Mill Road in
Palo Alto.The group was digging caves
in the lawn when interrupted by
security guards. After interviews with
the alleged chief, it was learned that
the group are hunters —bargain
hunters Their hope was to establish a
stronghold in close proximity to the
upcoming Corporate Motors Car Sale.
The blow-out sale will be held in the
SFCU parking lot (1500 Page Mill
Road) on February 17th.
Using signs and pictograms it was
explained to the chief that credit union
members could get preapproved for
auto loans in about one minute by
using l.oanClick (www.sfcu.org and
select loanclick). It was explained that
loan preapproval is also available by
calling SFCU's Any Hour Loans by
Phone toll-free at 888-725-SFCIJ.
Knowing that preapprovals will
help them speed through the car
buying experience, the bargain hunters
were anxious to return to their village
where they had left their laptops and
cellular phones.
The privilege of meeting the
bargain hunters was a career high for
the anthropologists that interviewed
the tribe. It also made this
reporter remember that we 4|\
are not so different after 4 *
all.These <. ave dwell
ers, looking for great -w
deals on cars, remind
us that there's a little SiSffl
bit of bargain hunter
in all of us.

Dear Q&Q: I am an aerodynamic engineer and I met a man who
tells me he can fold over 3000 models of paper airplanes from
U.S. currency. He promised to show me his favorites if I would
bring the bills and meet him by the train tracks at 11:56 p.m. I
am overjoyed. He said to bring large bills because they fly
better. My question is this, are fifties considered large or should
I take only hundreds to our rendezvous?
Signed, Sweaty Palms
Dear Sweaty,
Although I can understand your giddy excitement over this
opportunity, might I suggest you reconsider meeting this
individual? Perhaps you could ask him to meet you in a safer
place at a safer time (perhaps the lobby of the police station).
I'm no FBI agent, but I work at SFCU so I know.
Jackie Soriano, Card Services Supervisor, SFCU
Dear Q&Q: I would like to get a large tattoo of a thousand dollar
bill upside down on my belly. That way, when I'm feeling poor, I
can simply lift up my shirt, take a gander at my gut and know
that I still have money. My problem is. I can't find a thousand
dollar bill anywhere to use as a reference. Can you help me?
Signed, Bill Belly Mon
Dear Bill Belly,
Your idea is...um...cute. You are having trouble locating your
source art because the treasury no longer makes $1000 bills.
They haven't since 1969. You might want to check with
collectors. I work at SFCU so I know.
