1929
On Feb. 5, 1020.'1 lit- Daily ran an article
about plans tor an 18-hole golf course at
Stanford.
"If .i series of tentative pi< >posals .ire (at -
rieel out, Stanford mav soon have an 18-
liole goll course.
"A 12-inch water main running from the
t ampus to Searsville I .ake has been opei ai
ing tor the past two veai s. according to
Almon F. Roth, comptrollei ot the I niversi
tv. ()wing to the itu leased demand tbi
water brought about l)\ growth ot athletii
field requirements and the increased num
ber of residences on the i ampus. the I 12-
in< li Searsville line is inadequate.
"Lack of water supph has previously hin
dered ilu- construe tion ot a Stanford golf
course. I he proposed Felt Lake line would
practicalh double the watet supph and
would pass dim t K through one proposed
location for the golf course.
" 1 lie suggested sites tor the proposed
golf ionise are idealh located. Nine holes
would be plat ed near the lot atiou ot the old
stock farm buildings, along the lake, and
then to Ruble ( reek. I he second nine holes
would be laid on a section of land west of
the countv road and would continue west
ward bevond the I .allnop home. A variety
of topographs and natural ha/ards is pre
sented on the proposed com si s. Soil condi
tions ai e excellent.
"No definite sli ps have been taken as vet
b\ the I nivci sitv toward the laving out ot
the proposed golf courses."
Bottom line: What if Tiger Woods had attended
Stanford durinq the water shortaqe of the late
19205?
