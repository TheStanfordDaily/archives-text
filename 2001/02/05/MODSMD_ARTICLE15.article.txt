1 here is magic here. 1 here is structure and

superstars are the people who give this paper its

magic is the people, the chaos and the paper
that they produce together every day.
But xxe need more superstars, and we need
dillerent kinds ol superstars, so my greatest
hope lor this volume is that some ol you reading

Be nix superstars. Be the new people to experi

tioned a fcxx hundred words ago. Remember? I
came to The Daily expecting magic. I didn't see
it then, on that first dax. because I wasn't looking
in the right places or, better yet, in the right
laces.
1 here is magic here. 1 here is structure and
style, and there are definitely superstars. The
superstars are the people who give this paper its
(jiiirkx but functional stxle and structure. 1 he
magic is the people, the chaos and the paper
that they produce together every day.
But xxe need more superstars, and we need
dillerent kinds ol superstars, so my greatest
hope lor this volume is that some ol you reading
this right now xvill meet the challenge.
Be nix superstars. Be the new people to experi
ence this Dailx magic in the months to come.
Welcome to Volume 219.
