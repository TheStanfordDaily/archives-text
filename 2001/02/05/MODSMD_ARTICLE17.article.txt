De Klerk 'rewrote history'
be Klerk can lie, hut lie cannot take
undue credit. "I w.is the one who abol
ished apartheid. I person.ill\ abolished
apartheid."
So said I' .W. de Kiel k.it his speech last
week. Ilf was apparenth referring to the
literal fact that he, with the legislature, tc
pealed the legal framework of apartheid.
However, such short-sightedness and
uttci arrogance is an insult to .ill those who
died in the anti-apartheid movement.
From 1964 t<> 1998 alone, 21,11 I peo
ple died. I his docs not int lude major inci
dents. such as the 197b Sowcto killings in
which 7(H) high school students were
gunned down.
but these a<ti\ists did not die in vain.
Their protests made the countrv more
and more ungovernable. It also placcd de
Klerk in the right plate at the right time.
1 le and Ins administration could either at
tempt to wage a war or (boose a
negotiated settlement.
As a minority, they opted for the latter.
1 was sickcncd b\ de Klerk's speech, as he:
I) equivocated the vision of apartheid to

that of the V uropean I nion — mereb an
attempt tot reate sovereign states tor each
nationalitv; 2) point blank denied knowl
edge of the atrocities committed under
his administration (despite well-support
ed e\ idem e to the contrary); and, 3) t l iti
ti/etl those who licit! animosity toward
him as unforgiving.
I am forgiving, but. in order to be for
given one must first confess. I could have
t balked all of this up to a pathetic little man
who is touring the country, being paid
$10,000 for speeches in which he re-writes
history for uninformed university students.
I could not. however, in good faith
allow him to claim credit tor that which so
main paid the ultimate price. Amandla!
Awetliu! I he power. It is ours.

De Klerk visit sparks broader
leadership questions
As I continue to read and hear about
the visit of F.W. de Klerk. I find revelation
in the contrast between him and his to-

Nobel laureate, Nelson Mandela.
1 wonder: Who would I rather be? I he
man who worked within the system, or the
man who fought against it?
Desiring to address grave imbalances in
my own society, I have often considered
de Klei k's inside track, where life is more
comfortable and less controversial and
where frustration is tempered by appar
ent "babv steps" of progress.
Such a track, though, requires tolerat
ing and perpetuating a flawed system —
as de Klerk did by countenancing racial
atrocities under his watch. And. anyway,
how often do politicians who reach de
Klerk's level merely reflect, rather than
lead, trends?
I he Nelson Mandelas of the world,
when they cannot be ignored, usually face
persecution, prison and death threats, in
Mandela s case.
When our grandchildren look back with
horror at our own ecological violence and
ignorance, where will we tell them we st< xxl?
For "realism," despite injustice and devasta
tion, or for "idealism." despite ostracism?
