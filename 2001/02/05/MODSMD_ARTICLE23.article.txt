And they're off...
Last weekend, the No. 15 Stanford
softball team (3-0) kicked off the 2001
season with three convincing victories
.it home. I he Cardinal dominated its
opponents, allowing only one run to be
scored while posting 19 of its own in 19

0 victorv against San Francisco State,
followed by vesterday's successful dou

wins, 12-1 and 3-0.
In the first game against Santa
Clara, the Broncos put one run on the
board in the top of first by putting
together an error and a hit to center
field.
Stanford, however, responded im
mediately and never looked back. In
the bottom of the first, seniot Kamona
Shelburne tagged up from third base
to score on an RBI sacrifice to left field
by junior Jessica Mendo/a.
This was only the beginning.
The Cardinal offense exploded in
the second inning, scoring five runs
without allowing a single Bronco to

(ross the plate.
Head coach |<>lin Rutin.in was
pleased with the d.i\'s offensive
performance.
" Today there wast big pride fat tor."
Rittnian said. "Yesterda> we did not re
ally hit as a team. I odav a lot of people
came through for uv Shideler. Beeson,
Mendoza and both < ateliers reall\ (.line
out ready."
Stanford's offensive effort vesterdav
was led by senior third-baseman |enni
Shideler. who tallied live hits on the
day, including bat k-to-bat k doubles in
the first game.
"1 made niv adjustments from ves
terdav." Shideler said. "1 came to the
plate with a new approach."
Freshman catcher Michelle I "bin
also contributed to the offense with hei
first collegiate home run.
"It was incredible. 111irv said.
"Everything just «licked."
I he (.animal did not lei up m third
inning as Shideler, Robin Walker.
Shelburne and Mendo/a rallied to pro
duce four more runs.
Freshman catchei |essica Allistei
tlrove in a run with an RBI-double in
the fourth inning, marking her first
collegiate hit. Allistei was not the onl\

Cardinal with an KIM-douhle in the
fourth, however, .is Shideler added her
own to continue a streak that ended in
<i H-fbr-'l effort at bat.
I lie 12-1 victorv over the Broncos
was not purely an offensive effort.
Sophomore Dana Sorensen controlled
tbe defense from the < ir< le for four in
nings. Sorensen struck five batters out
.uid onlv allowed three hits m her first
win of the year.
"It is good to be bark." Sorensen
said. "1 was verv anxious to pla\. I think
that toda\ was a good st.ii ting point for
the season."
Stanford finished the game in the
fifth inning with sophomore lori Nv
berg on the rubber. Nvberg didn't
waste anv time, as she sti u< k out three
battels in a row to end the game.
I lit second game of the da\ proved
to be more of a (hallcngc as the (Cardi
nal stored three runs in a complete
seven innings of pla\.
In five innings of pitehing. sop ho
more Maureen I.edouj started foi
Stanford and onlv gave up two bits to
the Hrotuos.
Rittman brought in sophomore
pitt her Jamie Forman-Liu in the sixth.

Last weekend, the No. 15 Stanford
softball team (3-0) kicked off the 2001
season with three convincing victories
.it home. I he Cardinal dominated its
opponents, allowing only one run to be
scored while posting 19 of its own in 19
innings of play.
()n Saturday, Stanford recorded a 4-
0 victorv against San Francisco State,
followed by vesterday's successful dou
ble-header in which the team met
Santa Clara and came away with two
wins, 12-1 and 3-0.
In the first game against Santa
Clara, the Broncos put one run on the
board in the top of first by putting
together an error and a hit to center
field.
Stanford, however, responded im
mediately and never looked back. In
the bottom of the first, seniot Kamona
Shelburne tagged up from third base
to score on an RBI sacrifice to left field
by junior Jessica Mendo/a.
This was only the beginning.
The Cardinal offense exploded in
the second inning, scoring five runs
without allowing a single Bronco to

(ross the plate.
Head coach |<>lin Rutin.in was
pleased with the d.i\'s offensive
performance.
" Today there wast big pride fat tor."
Rittnian said. "Yesterda> we did not re
ally hit as a team. I odav a lot of people
came through for uv Shideler. Beeson,
Mendoza and both < ateliers reall\ (.line
out ready."
Stanford's offensive effort vesterdav
was led by senior third-baseman |enni
Shideler. who tallied live hits on the
day, including bat k-to-bat k doubles in
the first game.
"1 made niv adjustments from ves
terdav." Shideler said. "1 came to the
plate with a new approach."
Freshman catcher Michelle I "bin
also contributed to the offense with hei
first collegiate home run.
"It was incredible. 111irv said.
"Everything just «licked."
I he (.animal did not lei up m third
inning as Shideler, Robin Walker.
Shelburne and Mendo/a rallied to pro
duce four more runs.
Freshman catchei |essica Allistei
tlrove in a run with an RBI-double in
the fourth inning, marking her first
collegiate hit. Allistei was not the onl\

Cardinal with an KIM-douhle in the
fourth, however, .is Shideler added her
own to continue a streak that ended in
<i H-fbr-'l effort at bat.
I lie 12-1 victorv over the Broncos
was not purely an offensive effort.
Sophomore Dana Sorensen controlled
tbe defense from the < ir< le for four in
nings. Sorensen struck five batters out
.uid onlv allowed three hits m her first
win of the year.
"It is good to be bark." Sorensen
said. "1 was verv anxious to pla\. I think
that toda\ was a good st.ii ting point for
the season."
Stanford finished the game in the
fifth inning with sophomore lori Nv
berg on the rubber. Nvberg didn't
waste anv time, as she sti u< k out three
battels in a row to end the game.
I lit second game of the da\ proved
to be more of a (hallcngc as the (Cardi
