I t 111ii< theme dorms like I jamaa,
(asa /apata, Okaila and Muweknia-
I ah-Ruk manifest Stanford's pride in its
cultural diversitv. However, "ethnic
theme" max be a misleading term. De
spite the strong etliuii overtones of these
dorms. onl\ half «>f the house residents
are <>l the ethnic it\ designated as the
theme.
\ccording to the polic \ of the Stan
ford I ndcrgraduatc Housing Assign
ment Scr\ ices. these houses are not onh
intended for students of a specific eth
nic itx. Rather. thc\ arc geared towards
all students who are excited about the
c hallcnge of reac liing bcvonil their own
< iiltiu al experietu e.
but in practical application, how do
students who do not identih with an eth
nic itx rcalh feel about living in ethnic
dorms?
"Dining orientation, non-ethnic
freshmen tend to feel bad that tlicx don't
have an ethnic it\ to identih themselves
with." said I .indsav (.crvacio, resident as

sistant foi ()k.»<l.i, the Asian theme doi m.
\on-cthnic students agree with the
diflii 11It\ ol the initial transition.
"Fin Latino, and 1 originallv applied
to be in ( asa /.apata. the I.atino-thcmeil
doi m." said freshman I- van ()tero, w ho
li\es in ()kaila. "When I first heard I was
placed in an Asian theme dorm, I as
sumed it would be c lique-ish. since that
was the kind of experience I was expect
ing and hoping for in Zapata."
Freshman Brian Biggott said there
were noticeable differences between stu
dents that lie had to learn to live with in
I jamaa.
" I here have naturallv been some un
comfortable moments from time to
time," Biggott said. "We confronted un
deniable differences between diverse
cultures."
However, these initial moments of
discomfort usuallv pass. Main students
feel at ease after living in ethnic theme
dorms fora certain period of time.
"I had a lot of concerns my freshman
Near," said junior Alex ()lson. "But after
three vears in I jamaa. I'm convinced
that no one here has anv interest in

disc riminatiou."
Previous experience 01 interest in the
ethnic theme of the house has aided the
adjustment of main non-ethni< stu

"W hen I was in Japan, I was definite
ly in the niinorit\ there,'" I laugh said. "I
realized how helpful it was to have an or
ganization that enables people from .1
common ha< kground to get togcthei to
talk about their experiences. It w.is ex
tremelv valuable.
Sometimes students deliberated

Z.ipata, also correspond to the theme of
her residence.
"Although I'm not Latina, I do have
an interest in Latin-American c ultures.'
sa\s (aislunan. "I'm thinking of double
majoring 111 Spanish and biologv. I'm so
glad 1 was plat t'(l licit-. I rcall\

"During our ethnic program

very supportive ol one another
and understanding of where peo
ple are cttilling from. While not all
students attend the etlinit atti\i
ties. thev know that the opportuni
ts is open for everyone to become
involved."
Mam noii-etlmit students have
utilized sin h dorm programs as a
stepping-stone to beet tilling more
active in dorm life.

"I'm taking a class on Asian
Americans in art and media of
fcrcd through the tlorin," said
Otero. "Since taking the class. I've
become more active in the dorm
than ever before. Being in Okada
has opened up tn\ mind to dilter
ent experiences and a different
culture."
Biggot, who initially felt un
comfortable in the African-Ameri
can theme house, now is the un

He saitl he feels his experience in
Ujamaa is invaluable.
"For the first time in ni\ lite. I
found mvself living in the luinori

toward another culture lias been
immense," saitl Biggott. "I've
found that coming to a bettei un
