I ah-Ruk manifest Stanford's pride in its
cultural diversitv. However, "ethnic
theme" max be a misleading term. De

dorms. onl\ half «>f the house residents
are <>l the ethnic it\ designated as the
theme.

ford I ndcrgraduatc Housing Assign
ment Scr\ ices. these houses are not onh
intended for students of a specific eth

I jamaa.
" I here have naturallv been some un
comfortable moments from time to
time," Biggott said. "We confronted un
deniable differences between diverse
cultures."
However, these initial moments of
discomfort usuallv pass. Main students
feel at ease after living in ethnic theme
dorms fora certain period of time.
"I had a lot of concerns my freshman
Near," said junior Alex ()lson. "But after
three vears in I jamaa. I'm convinced
that no one here has anv interest in
