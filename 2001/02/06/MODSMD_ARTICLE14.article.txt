1990
Oil Feb. (>. 1990. Hie Daily ran an article about white
backlash t<> some of the reforms of then South African
President 1* YV. de Klerk.
"The main political part\ exhorted whites
vesterda\ to mohili/.e against 'the revolutionary, left-wing
annouiH ements' of President F.W. de kin k.
"Audi its 1 reurnicht, the Conservative l'art\ leader,
s.iid South Africa's 5 million whites faced 'the hour of
n nth ' I lis p.irtv applied fora pel nut fora mass marc h in
I'retoi la on Feb. 15 to launch .i freedom sti aimed at
protet tiiii* whites from domination I>\ the lÂ»lac k majority.
"De Klc ik. in.i momentous speech last week, lifted
bans on more than (SO anti-apartheid groups, including
the African National Congress guerrilla movement, and
promised to free jailed ANC leadei Nelson Mandela in
hopes of i tearing the way for negotiations on black-white
power sharing."
Bottom line: De Klerk's name in The Daily? Not such a
novelty after all.
