Calling all journalists,
aspiring journalists,
writers, aspiring writers,
photographers,
would-be editors, men,
women, children, etc.
The Daily wants you. Badly. As part of our effort to expand and
diversify our staff, we'd love to have as many of you join our writer
or photographer pool as possible. No experience is necessary, just
enthusiasm, good old-fashioned dedication, and a love of pizza
(we order a lot of it.)
If you're interested, please call us (5-2100), stop by (Storke
Publications Building), or write us (news@daily.stanford.edu or
photo@daily.stanford.edu). We'd love to meet as many of you as
possible and we look forward to hearing from you soon.
You don't even need to know how to spell!
