## In midst of tragedy, OSU players unite

It is ama/ing how athletes —
from high school i<> collect
to the professional ranks —
muster the strength, night in
ind night out, to give all the\ havi
mi the name ot sports.

Hut underneath .ill ol that —
underneath the Rodriguez-esque
salai ics and the oflensive rap 1\ tics
and the allegations of sexual as
s.iult at a babysitter's post-prom
partv — there is something more.
