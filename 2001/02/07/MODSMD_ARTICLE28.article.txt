Main governments have a process
i(»i people to exert ownership ovci
propertv. I Ins process conters rights
to the owner to use the propcrt\ while
excluding others troni legallx using
the same pre>pert\.
A common mctaphoi ten propertx is
a "bundle ot slicks.' Within the
metaphor, each stuk is ot a different
length, texture and thickness. I Ins
corresponds to the notion tli.it \oni
rights with regards to propertx nia\ be
different in particular situations.
One ol the lights most coininonlv
associated with ownership defined in
its broadest sense is the ahilit\ to con
vex what von own to anothei person.
I Ol instance, propertv sales are so
common that we barelv take notice. II
von own voui house, von can sell it to
someone else — usnallv. However,
even voui tight to convex' voui prop
ertv is not absolute, and the law is
tilled with exi eptions.
I heretore, to accuratelx describe

"bundle ot siiiks in iis description.
I oi example, a phvsiiallx identical

piec e ol land is ditterent it I he owner is
restricted from building upon it be
cause- ot environmental or /oiling reg

sin h rest i ic t ions.
With the quantum leaps forxvarcl in
medical adx anc es ovei the past c enturv,
the concepts ol propertv are extending
into areas prcviouslv unexplored, such
as human organic inatei ial.
I he chtlicultv lies m our inabilitv
and unwillingness to adecjuatelx de
sctibeoui "bundle ot sinks.' In 1951,
doctors pertorniecl the liist successful
solid organ transplant when a ktducv
was transplanted troni a living identical
twin to Ins brother. I he next three
decades witnessed the liist successtul
livei transplant (IW>3), the liist heart
transplant (1 *M>7), the liist pancreas
transplant ola living donoi (l'.)78) and
the til st single lung transplant (1983).
In Nov 19SH. the loocl and Drug
\d in i n i st l at ion approved c v
clospotine, an immunosuppressant
drug used to combat transplant rejec -
tion. Studies showed that the drug
could potentiallv increase survival
rates in liver and kidncx transplant pa
tients bv up to 50 pel ( etit.
With the increase in technological
( apahilitx. the demand for solid organs
rose dramatically, but snpplv did not
tollovv. Seeing evidence ot systemic
problems with the distribution ol
donoi organs, then Surgeon (ieneial
( fverett Kopp confirmed in 19SS
that problems existed with distributive
fait ness.
I lie perception was that wealthv
and well-connected indiv iclnals were
able (c > receive organs ahead ol others
who waited longei periods and were
perhaps classified in a more ciiik.il
condition.
I o address the problem, then I'res

ident Ronald Reagan announced an
initiative to provide a solution and
convened what is now referred to as
the American ( ouiu il on I ransplanta

Act.
I he act, since amended, has sever

need of a transplant based on proto

necessit\.
I he act also provided funding fora
contract with .1 private organization to
administet the program. In 1987,1 lin
ed Organ Sharing Network received
the contract and li.is maintained it to
this dav.
Second, the act provides lot the
