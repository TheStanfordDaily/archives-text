This dramatic NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope image of the Ant Nebula, showing 1 0 times more detail than available in
previous images, reveals the "ant's" body as a pair of fiery lobes protruding from a dying, Sun like star. The Hubble images di
rectly challenge old ideas about the last stages in the lives of stars. By observing Sun like stars as they approach their deaths,
the Hubble Heritage image of Mz3 — along with pictures of other planetary nebulae — shows that our Sun's fate probably will
be more interesting, complex and striking than astronomers imagined just a few years ago. (Courtesy of Hubble Heritage)
