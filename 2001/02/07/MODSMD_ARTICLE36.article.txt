a ml. worse yet. it's raining. I'm too tool
for an umbrella. I'm going to have to hoof
it sans fnoteclnni. II ill I gel less wet running
through llie rain, 01 walking?
A: Ah, freshmen. Ihey think ihcil
questions are s<» simple. Ihe .niswe! .s
more complit .1 led than intuition would
suggest.
You might think von get less wet 111 li
ning. because von're spending less lime
in the tain. lint, then again, in .1 given
amount ol time, vou'll move through
more r.iin running than walking. Do
the two el feels cancel out ? Is there a spe
(ilit speed tli.it gives vou .1 minimum
amount of exposure? And dots voui
head get wet 111 the same wa\ vour bodv
does?
Koi this question, Answer (.111 <011-

We'll explain the math lor those let hies,
then illustrate the answer with .1 more
intuitive analogx f<>l the fu/./ies.
Let's start with .111 assumption: I lie
rain is falling straight down, with 110
wind to blow n at .111 angle. 1 he next
step is to change the frame ol refer
