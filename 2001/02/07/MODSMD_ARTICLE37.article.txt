# Using math to avoid the rain
## 
### 
pel son, let s imagine this person is
moving up through .1 bait li of station
ar\ lain droplets, like- a fog. as he
walks lorward.
Ihe two situations are perlectlv
equivalent. Ihe velocit\ ol the 1.1111
droplets moving down now becomes
the \ertical velocitv ol the person ino\-
ing up, as represented In \ l( p 111 Figure
A. I he hori/ontal velocitv <>l the person
moving along the ground is represent
ecl by \ !(l f t .
II we combine the two velocities, we II
be able to use |iisi one arrow to repie
sent all of the movement 111 the svstein.
I sing vecioi addition, we get Ihe result
ing diagonal arrow to repieseni the new
vectoi.
Now we need to simplit\. When
you're on the move 111 the rain. \oii get
wei Iwo wavs; 1 ithei the rain falls on
\our head. 01 it hits the front of \Olll

ooclv as \on move t lirotigi
the die>plcis I .el's consid
ei the front of voui bodv
first. We'll treat vou as .
straight line, with 111 c
length of the line ec|iu\ a
leiu lo yoni height.
Now, here's wh\ wc
fro/e the rain droplets: I lie
amount of lam von en
counter will be dircc il\ 1 e
laled to the atea voui bodv
c ov crs as v on inov c

through the 1 am. Ihe more area you
move through, the 11101 e droplets voiirun
into. I'herefote, we need to compare the
areas you cover running versus walking,
and we'll have our answei.
10 observe the area vou trace, we'll
move vour "line" forward as \ou move
along the diagonal vector we worked
«»ut. litis wav, the diagonal nioveinent
encompasses both moving forward
along the ground and moving "up
through the rain. As vou < an see in l ig
ure B, vim trace a parallelogram with
the front ol 'voui bod\.
11 \ou are i milling, the value ol \oui
hori/ontal vector is increased, because
you're moving faster, and the icsulting
diagonal vector is less steep because
there is more of a hori/ontal component
lo il. It you walk, ihe horizontal vectoi
contributes less, and vou have a more
vertical. 01 steeper, diagonal \edor.

Now . we |iist need lo t ale u
lale the area covered In voui
bodv as vou move forward,
and we II have the total
amount ol 1 am enc ouniei ed.
But here's the trick! '1 he area
ola parallelogram is equal lo
its base (represented bv how
tall von aie) times us height
(iepiesenied l>\ the total dis
tant e traveled). Hut the dis
tance traveled is ihe same ci
lliei wav. as is voui height, so
the steepness ol I lit parallelo
gram doesn't mallei. Ihe
area is the same running 01
walking, so ihe lionl ol vou
gels just as wet eitliei wav!
Weal a big enough hat -
vou II pi obablv want lo c ovei
vour shoulders - and vou can
take vour time and walk into
I -11 uin late. Bui what 11
von're hatless?
Now, instead ot imagining
the person as a line, eonsidei
him as a 11.it iet tangle, Willi
the base ol the rectangle the
"si/e" ol vour head.

As \oii move through the rain. \<>u
trace two parallelograms. One I'.'pre
sents the path Hand In voui boclv, as
discussed, and the second (shaded in
Figure ( ) represents the path traced b\
voui head as it gets rained on Irotn
ahove.
And the areas are different! I his is
because the- base and height are
"switched." I he base.' now represents
the si/el the head (prett\ big tis a
Irosh, I assume) and that obviouslx st.i\ s
the same running 01 walking, but the
height is no lougei the horizontal dis
tance traveled, but the vertical distance
traveled as \<>u move "up through the
stationai \ i am.
So, with more time to move "up
through the 1 am when vou walk, the
height of the parallelogi am will be
longer, and the resulting area ol the
p.uallelogram will be- inc leased.
()f coin se. this is intuitue. More 1.1111

luts voui head walking, beta use vou're
spending more lime nutlet the rain.
l or ihost* not mathematit a 11\ in
t lined, here's a more intuitive analogy:
I 11111 kol vourselt holding a bucket as
vou move through (he rain. II \on run.
you'll ohvioush i <>1 lc( i less water than it
\ou walk. Km the trout ol the bucket is
going to gel as wet whether vou're
w .ilking or i mining.
You're going to encounter the same
amount ot watei droplets with .iu\ tot
ward movement, regardless ot how last
vou i hoose to hit them. 1 heietore, the
wetness ol the Iront ol the bucket is .i
i onstant, and the question depends on
how much water the but ket collects.
So. the next time vou're sum kin the
rain, with no protection, go with vout
iiistim is — run!
