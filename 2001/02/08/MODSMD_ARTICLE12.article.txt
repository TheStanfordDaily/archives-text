1960
On Feb. <S, 1900, I "lie 1 )aih ran an article about
Stanford's new post < >112 li< e.
" I he new $222,000 post of fit c, complete with
outside boxes, new equipment and increased
flooi spare, will open lor use at 0 a.m.
"(ieneral Deliven Ibi students lias been dis
continued and all mail will be delivered i<» boxes
or dormitories, boxes ma\ be rented lint cents
a (|uarter or 59 rents lot the remaintlci <>l the
year.
"The new post office more ilian doubles the
floor space ol the old. and most ol the space is
functional. C.ountci sei vice ok upies a small area
just inside the entrance, and the outside wall
boxes, the most unusual feature, total 1.170 as
compared to the previous I
Bottom line: One wonders — is most of tfte space in tfie
post office really functional?
