One popul.u explanation foi tlu>

trend, ai cording to students and faculty in
the Psychology Department, is the tight
ening of the academic job market in recent
M'.us. Psychology Prof. Dan Spieler notes
that the higlih competitive nature of the
field has encouraged .1 lot of faculty and
students to think about other options tor
students to investigate upon completing
then doctor.ite.
Students have also expressed trust ra
tion with an alleged decline in the amount
of grant monc\ available tot independent
researi hand a recent nationwide push to
publish earliei 111 the graduate schooling
pi lH ess.
Another motivating factor tor doctoral
students to leave .u adetnia is the extreme
ly high cost of liv ing in the Bav Area.
Second-vear doctoral student (orrine
l.ockenhofl said the financial pressures
often make it essential lot students to ob
tain part-time cmplov incut 111 local t orpo
rations just tot over t licit living expenses.

For some students, these jobs are simplv
necessary, though often enlightening, di
versions from a career path that will ulti
mately end in an academic setting.
kellv Wilson, a second-year doctoral
student who works as a research assistant
in tlie usability laboratory fora local In
let net company, remarked that, although
her experience outside of the academic
1 calm has been educational and often en
tertaining, she doesn't see it as a life-time
commitment.
"Working in the industry has made me
confident that it would be personally un
iiilfilling to work in a big corporation post
graduation." Wilson said.
But, tor others, part time jobs with local
businesses often become the logical first
steps in a commercial or corporate caieer.
IU taking advantage of grow ing industries
and .t strong network of Stanford connec
tions in the bav Area, many graduate stu
dents are able to establish the foundations

ot a corporate career before they even re
ceive their diploma.
For students who do decide to leave
academia, whether thev make that < hoite
before or after graduation, manv industry
jobs offer very attractive rewards. In addi
tion to fewer hours and bigger pave hecks,
positions in the corporate world are some
times more exciting and team-oriented.
Furthermore, the nature of the testing
done in corporate settings can allow re
searchers to witness immediate, real
world results in ways that tightly con
trolled academic research cannot.
Although Stanford's doctoral students
seem eager to support those who choose
the industry track, some faculty members
are less enthusiastic.
"If the temptation of these attractive
jobs continues to compete with academit
jobs, we may not be able to find high-qual
ity people to replace us." said Psvt hologv
Department ('hair Phillip Zimbardo iu a

Jan. 12 interview with the Chronicle of
I ligher Kdm ation.
Although losing some of theii l>est and
brightest to the corporate world ina\ he a
legitimate concern tot the i.u ult\ <>t the
I'svchology Department, the private sec
tot and students are benefitting from a
wider range of options.
" I think there is a feeling in our depart
ment lb.u anything besides straight hasu
research is a failure," said S.iskia I rail, a
second-vear doctoial student. "Hut there
are lots of other wavs t« > use psvchologx in
meaningful wax s."
Spieler also sees the positive side of a
wider range of options for graduate
students.
"1 actualh think ibis is ,i good trend.
I lie tact is thai the selection of an ,k .ident
ic position is also a choice of a particular
tvpe of lifestyle that pet haps not even one
wants. Letting students know tlics have a
range of options is a good thing."
