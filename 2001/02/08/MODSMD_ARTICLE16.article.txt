THE CONVICTION OF former
Stanford research associate Hua l)i
on charges of leaking Chinese state
secrets is an excellent opportunity
for University faculty and administrators to
use their influence in an appeal for his
release.
As an educational institution, Stanford com
mands strong national and international re

gives the University considerable political
power.
Former Provost Condoleezza Rice's position
in the Bush Administration is one noted exam

resources the University should (all upon in

In 1997, when 11 ua visited ( liina to at

Hua's first conviction was nullified in 1998.

10-year conviction, the researcher may need

Lee espionage case. And, though the I Diversi
