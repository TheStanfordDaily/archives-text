University land-use plan
'inconsistent, self-critical'
I find it absurdly hypocritical that
Stanford plans to build the Carnegie
Foundation facility in the middle ola
salamander habitat, not long after it has
severely limited public access to the Stan
ford Foothills area in the name of "con
servation" and "restoration." I'm not
sure how much I care about salaman
ders. or whether 1 really believe that the
area is critical to maintaining them, but
Stanford's inconsistent, self-serving atti
tude toward land preservation is appar
ent in any case. They should either keep
the park access restrictions and not build
the Carnegie facility in the Foothills, or
they should lift the access restrictions
(which 1 think everyone knows were in
stituted not to protect the Foothills, but
to reduce the constituency opposing
their development) and not look so
dumb in trying to develop a part of it.
Personally, I'd prefer the latter option.
On the other hand, there is plenty of
room to build the Carnegie facility on the
core campus side of Junipero Sen a, so 1
oppose the current Stanford plan re
gardless of any changes they make to
their selfish new policy on access to the
Foothills.

Mental illness article provokes questions
Your article "Mental illness not un
usual" (which plausibly could have been
titled "Mental illness normal") was
provocative.
1 was disturbed to hear that the director
of Stanford's Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services believes the number of stu
dents with severe psychological disorders
has increased greatly in the last decade.
"Why?" I wondered. How is it possible
that we — supposedly the most privi
leged members of the wealthiest society
of all time — are unable to take care of
enough basics to be healthy? What are
we doing wrong?
As 1 pondered, though, 1 realized that
you did not think your readers would
want to join me in asking "why." The ar
ticle did not explore the question, and
that may help to answer it.
Even with problems of our own
minds, we are reluctant to look within.
Instead of considering how our various
expectations for others may cause men
tal illness, we insist that mental maladies
are primarily genetic. Instead of modify
ing unhealthy lifestyles, we "treat" our
selves with drugs.
This is enough to give me pause. I'll
take your article as an invitation to intro

sped and ask again, more seriously,
"What do I want?"

Horoscope 'exceeds ignorance'
As an individual who is solidly root
ed in tin- pursuit of all things academic,
I, of course, hold in high esteem the
skilled interpretation of the heavenly
bodies to assist in the resolution of my
life's trajectory. 1 found that my horo
scope today instructing me to "establish
some sort of routine" exceeds igno
rance and extends into the propagation
of a dehumanizing implementation of
the unnecessary banality of "order"
into our innovative and free-spirited
lives.
Our society is so drenched in irra
tional desire lot regularity that the nu
ance of human interaction and lite is
rarely realized and potentiated to its
fullest extent. The Daily, by publishing
such an inappropriate recommenda
tion. is only perpetuating the undue
value placed upon the mundane and
mechanical. This reduces us from lively
creatures into robot-like sac ks of flesh
that merely go through the motions of
sincere, spontaneous and unimpeded
human interaction.
As the Backstreet Boys say, "Let mt
show you the shape of my heart."

Hoover collection break-up
'lamented around the globe'
This is a response to the letters to the
editor from University Librarian
Michael Keller about a future for the
Hoover Library on the question of "re
turning to the basic goals of the Hoover
Library" by dissolving it.
The Hoover Library was established
in 1919 by President Herbert Hoover;
Ralph Lutz, who was its first director;
and others of vision. This library would
prove to be unique in the world, in that it
combined a huge collection both of sin
gular archival materials as well as valu
able and often rare secondary publica
tions under one roof.
Now. this unique blend of resources,
always accessible to all, and prized and
respected by scholars from around the
world, is to be dismantled in a way that
breaks up its most prized quality. Sec
ondary (published) material will be sep
arated from the archival, broken up in as
yet to-be-announced categories and fer
ried off to either annexes or storage as
yet unrevealed, despite the fact that

Hoover Library has spacc left tor .1 num
ber of years' worth of new acquisitions.
Hoover Library was located at Stan
ford for various reasons, one of these
being the invitation to Herbert Hoover
as director of the Belgian Relief Com
mission to store the records of that effort
at Stanford "for the benefit of Stanford's
prestige in years to come."
But Hoover insisted — and, in 1932,
the I Diversity Board of Directors accept
ed — that the library's mandate was to
engage in"the collection and preserva
tion of materials for research in the soc i.il
sciences, the humanities and the sciences
in relation to war, revolution, and
peace," and that the library's existence
was to be autonomous, given the collec
tion's focus was to serve scholarship, not
a University curriculum.
Despite this agreement, Ralph Lutz
struggled .ill his years as director against
repeated efforts by successive University
presidents to place the library under the
University's control. But the Hoover Insti
tution's leadership gradually lost the com
prehension of and appreciation for the
wisdom of the library 's original mission.
Instead of continuing Hoover and
Lutz's priority of securing uninterrupt
ed energetic funding for their highly re
garded library, and maintaining a regu
lar program supporting and financing
an alert and continued collection pres

ence around the globe, today's leader
ship cadre .11 Hoovei has high-profile
funding drives for their political think
tank instead. Now vears of disregard for
their original mandate are today coming
home to roost.
Of course, given the abandonment of
financial autonomy from the Lniversitv,
it was reasonable that sooner or later the
University would lay claim to the I loover
Library, whose budget thev supplement
ed to the tune of some 53,000,000.
I he move to transfer collection duty
to the University library system, and
break up the Hoover collection, is
lamented around the globe among the
scholarly community, where Hoover Li
brary has long been recognized as a sin
gular and unique resource.
Perhaps we should all be reassured In
the University telling us not to worry;
they've thought about all this, and their
plans are sound. Their plans have also
been drafted 111 a secretive process that
seems to have been more concerned with
budget than the maintenance of <1 world
class collection. Worse still, it apparently
did not involve any significant input
from history faculty or the many scholars
from around the world, famous or not,
who actually use the place.
