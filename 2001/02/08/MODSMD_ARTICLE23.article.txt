let us pause ti>r .1 nn»■
ment now. From timt
to time, it is important
—stop .iiul reflect or

the beauty ot
the small things
tli.it em ic li the
world. Today,
let us consider
and pay hom
age to a Ix/autiful
flower in all our
lives: the dunk.
It is Febru
ary, the (.obi

Desert of months in the spoils
world. With apologies to hocke\.
tennis and men's volleyball, the
onlv giant of the sports world
th.it looms large this month is
basketball. It is now inescapable
on television, in the newspapers
and on the Internet.
Chris Webber doesn't like
cow-tipping? Front page news.
Kobe s.iid Shad's < ar was .1 2001
model when it's an '02? Stop the

Maples, 'cause otherwise all
we've got to watch is the NFL.
It's evervwhere vou look
iu the air and in vour tood and
water. Main have been driven
during this month to simply
throw up their hands and de
( hire a moratorium. "No more!'
vou hear the cry go up around
campus. "1 can't take it! I can't
follow the Washington State box
stores to predit i it they make the
tournament! I <an t read anoth
er interminable e-mail from the
Sixth Man ( lub telling me tlu
team 'needs to hustle'! I can't
pretend to care il the Raptors 01
the Nuggets or the Hawks have
salary cap room! I'll never watt li
basketball again!''
Breathe, my friends.
Breathe, and remember tlu
things that brought vou to 11 it
game. And raise high anionic
them the sweetest moment in
modern sports: the dunk.
It conies in so many varieties:
the tomahawk, the reverse, tlu

evitable as a train wreck, like

Mil belle Snow from lennessee
turned into a national hero
overnight In dunking in a women's
game in Deccinljer, becoming just
the fourth woin.in to (It) so, and this
in .1 game broadcast onl\ In the
Oxygen Network. Manx question
whethei its a good tiling loi the
women's game, but go and watt It
the film and watch them stop the
game to celebrate. I hen come tell
ilie that s not ,t good thing.
When those five guxs come

"We got beat bad. No, we got beat
real bad. the first question xou .isk
isn t. What was the score? It's,
"Did vou get dunked on?" It tl.ex
|tist look down at theit shoes and
nod slowlv, xou know tlie\ were
right. Nothing s.i\n "beat-down"
like dunking in intramuials.
What is it about the dunk? It's a
teat of athletic ism, be it t aw or liigli
ly trained, that tew can manage but
evervone has attempted. What ll.it
footetl tool among ns hasn't had a
basketball alone on a court and
thought. "Yeah, I can't jump over
my doorjanib. But tnavbe out tin
the court... just tnavbe ..."

tried a dunk and been three feet

Nothing else turns the momen

tum of the game in the same wav.
A tool Jacobsen from
five feet behind the arc will get the
alumni on their feet, sure, but no
bod\ ever put a prettv outside sltoi
on a poster. It's the sheer eleva
tion, the sense of power, the claim
ing of the l ini as one's ow u — like
a Spanish explore! planting a flag
in tin New \\ oi lil — that does it.
It's brief, it's transitory, but the
image lasts forever.
Who among us can forget the
picture of \l.uk Madsen against
Rhode Island three vears ago,
slamming home a final dunk and
shaking what Ins momma gave
him like the women's sw itn team at
( i itu s roll their eves and 11 \
about "the death of the team."
I hex II tell xou tot lax s N HA is too
tot used on the think, that getting
on highlight reels is all anvone
cares about, that no one tares
about fundamentals anx more.
I hex II tell vou that it's the Ainei t
tan obsession with individual
prowess that will make the dunk
supreme anil burx the sport at
exerx level.
None of those 11 itu s can dunk,
of course.
Sure, fundamentals are xvon
tlei till. Hut let's he honest: 1 here's
plentx of time for the set plax and
the easx lax up in the retirement
home leagues.
It that's wh.it basketball was all
about. I wouldn't make it through
February. I hank God we've got
the dunk.
II it xvasn't for that, we'll all be
xvatt hins> tennis.

Jt'H ('.oofier, 11 senior, will be spending
llit' rest of lilt- night on the court, hying
to think.
