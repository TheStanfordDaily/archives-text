### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
II there was ever a time the
Stanford women's basketball team
(12-7. Pacific 10 Conference)
needed lot .ill upon its home court
advantage, n would he Ihis week
end. I lie C.ardinal hosts Oregon
tonight .md (>rcgon State on Sat
uid.iv. hoping to avenge losses to
both of the m hools in ()regon ear
liei this season.
1 he (Cardinal stands one game
out of the Pac-10 lead, tied with
Arizona and Washington. I lie
three schools trail a dominating
Arizona State scpiad that lias won
m\ straight games and sits atop the
conference.
Stanford is on a streak of its
own. cntct ing tonight's game with
a five-game winning streak, in
cluding its two wins in Los Angeles
last weekend. II the Cardinal can
net wins against the Dm ks and the
Heavers this weekend, it will have
beaten every team in the Pac-10
with the exception of Arizona,
whom it meets again March 8 in
IIK soil.
'()ur heads right now are in the
game," said junioi l.indsex Ya
masaki. "If we are l<x used, we will
win. Kadi game is getting better
and better, and each practice we
are looking better and better."
Stanford's team has not been
more rattled this season than when
it fat ed the Ducks in Eugene Jan.
13. Oregon pressed freshman
point guard Nic ole Powell, forcing
Cardinal turnovers and prevent
ing Stanford 112 rom ever developing
an\ real offensive flow. I he Ducks
came awav with a 72-54 win.
In the game. Stanford centered
its defense around the Ducks
tough inside lineup of Angelina
Wolvert, Jenm Mowe, l.indsex
Dion and Brianne Meharn. How
ever, while the Cardinal did a de
tent job limiting these plavers in
side. Oregon guards Jamie Craig
lie.id and Kourtney Slueve de
st roved Stanford from the perinie

ter. hitting nine on (>()
pen ent shooting from bevond the
arc.
However, with a new veil lie. .1
new perspective and some neu
lonnd confidence, Stanford |ust
ma\ have the right formula foi
su((ess this time around.
I he (Cardinal seems to have li
na!l\ m.ide the necessary adjust
ments after the loss of freslnnan
point guard Susan King and
sophomore point guard |aniie
C.arev. While the team s hall <011-
trol certainh isn't textbook, and
other squads still seem to force sev
eral Stanford turnovers, the ( at

clinal li.is begun to overlook its
weaknesses and coin entratc on its
strengths.
"We are a better team with
Jamie and Susan, but they aren't
playing. ' s.iid head coach l ata
VanDcrvccr. "1 atn realh happy
how evervone else- has stepped up.
