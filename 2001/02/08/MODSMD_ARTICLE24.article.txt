m\ straight games and sits atop the
conference.
Stanford is on a streak of its
own. cntct ing tonight's game with
a five-game winning streak, in
cluding its two wins in Los Angeles
last weekend. II the Cardinal can
net wins against the Dm ks and the
Heavers this weekend, it will have

whom it meets again March 8 in
IIK soil.
'()ur heads right now are in the
game," said junioi l.indsex Ya
