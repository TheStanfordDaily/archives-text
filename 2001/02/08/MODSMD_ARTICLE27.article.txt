## New coach, new goals, 12 new frosh highlight season 
### SARA LEV 
"What h aw you done today to
become a national champion?" For
the members ol tlu- Stanford
women's lacrosse team, this isn't
just the question printed .11 the top
of each player's woi kont sheet; it is
the team motto, and the unifying
force behind a young, talented
team in transition.
With a brand-new coaching
stall. 12 new freshmen, junior
team members recently returned
from abroad and .1 new set of am
bitious goals fbi the future, the
team has a lot 011 iis plate.
The mastermind behind these
( hanges is pel haps ilie most signif
icant change of all — new head
(oat li Mu hele I 'hlfelder. Previous
coach Heidi Connor-Igoe an
nounced her resignation last |une,
citing family reasons, and Stan
ford's \thletic Department con
ducted a nationwide search fin a
new coach to till the spot.
I hlfelder, .1 l s National
Lacrosse team membei since 1 ( .> ( JI.
was hired last August, She comes
to the Fat in from Duke, where she
was associate head coach last sea
sou and brings with hei assistant
coach I i/ Kittleman.
Besides her extraordinan ex
periente, both .is .1 playei and .is a
coach, I hlfeldei brings an intense
commitment to Stanford lacrosse,
.ind an intense low foi the game.
According to bet players, she
expects nothing less from them,
.ind she is confident that the team
has the talent and the driw to be
1 he best.
Senior co-captain Katherine
barnes said, "Mu hele is incredible.
She is .111 atna/ing teachei with
great l.u rosse skills.md wars of ex
perience playing lacrosse .it the
highest lewl. She lows the game,
which is something that we haw
agreed as .1 team is (1 m ial to being

a successful player."
According to junior co-captain
Caroline Osterwise, I hlfelder's
talent and knowledge .is a plawr
translate directb into her being an
effective leader.
" There's so much respect for
her. ()siei wise said. "Lwr\da\ [at
practice) we're out on the field as
piring to Ik- her."
Just as impressive as her cre
dentials are I hlfelder's aspirations
for the Stanford squad. Last year,
for the third year in a row, the
team finished as conference cham
pions in the Western Women's
1 ..u rosse League.
However, dominating lacrosse
on the west coast is no longer
enough foi the Stanford women.
I Ins \ear, the team is detet mined
to ai hieve the national recognition
necessan to earn a bid to the
\( A \ tournament.
Currently, Stanford is not .1
mcmbei of a league officially rec
ogni/ed b\ the NCAA. I herefore,
111 order to make it to the Women's
Lac rosse National Tournament 111
\la\. (he\ would need to set lire an
at-l.nge bid, .111 imitation to the
tournament awarded by the
\( \.\ based on season record and
strength of s( hedule.
I his is n<) eas\ feat fora new
West ( < >ast l.u 1 < tsse team like Stan
ford. L.u rosse has long been
known as an Last Coast sport,
dominated b\ powerhouses like
Marx land, |anus Madison, Prince
ton and Virginia.
West Coast teams have just
begun to start up in the past five or
si\ \e.iis at schools like Stanford,
California and I C-Davis, and,
consequently, the\ lack the experi
ence and local (onipetition neces
s.ll \ to develop national stature.
In order to demonstrate to the
N( A A ili.il 11 deserves a bid. Stan
ford l.u rosse needs to earn recog
nition nation.ills as a consistentl\
strong program b\ w inning league
games, performing solidh against
tough competition from the Last
and securing top high school re
cruits foi the C(tilling seas(»u.
I he team will have a chance to

prove themselves in the Spring
against stub qualit\ Last Coasi
teams as Vanderbilt, Cornell and
Ceorge Mason, furthermore, the
lacrosse program lias alreach
signed three solid high school se
niors foi next war, including de
lender Kelsex I wist, from Nalti
more, Md., one of the top recruits
iu the nation.
I hlfeldei saul she is reluc I ant to
set quantitative goals for the team.
"Right now we're looking to de

velop more than a good lacrosse
team, we're looking to start a tradi
tion." she said. As she sees it.the
real \ ictoi \ w ill come from playing
.1 consistent level of Stanford
lacrosse even day, 111 every prac
tice and in even game.
