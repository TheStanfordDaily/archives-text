Winter quarter is the start of the recruit

prospects of an economic slowdown in the

not be as manv opportunities this veai as m

"I would be under the impression that
things are better now than ever," Lundsteen
said.
She admits that the internship search is
more competitive than looking for.i full-time
job because there are generallv less positions
available. However, she savs that there are
c urrentlv 3,500 internships in the ( DC tlata
base and that 00 to 100 new internships are

Surviving the quake
An exhibit celebrating the work of late British clergyman and naturalist
Gilbert White was reopened in Peterson Gallery of Green Library. Stanford
opened the exhibit in 1989, but was forced to close it immediately because
of the Loma Prieta earthquake. The exhibit runs from Feb. 4 to April 8.

"1 .iin frustrated because I
don't know how to use the re
sources [at Stanfordj," Wilson
said.
Wilson, an Knglish major, is
disappointed that industries she
is interested in. like editing and
human resources, are not as well
represented .is other opportuni
ties tor technical majors or for
people interested in financial
services.
However, Lundsteen said stu
dents must look beyond Cardinal
Recruiting, .in interactive Web
site where employers post job op
portunities and students can sub
nut resumes. She admits this ser
vice gives people the feeling that
the only jobs available are in con
sulting. investment banking and
engineering. According to Lund
steen, the majority of listings in
the internship database run by
the ( IXare tor communications
or non-profit organizations.

"I think the important thing is
to be relentless," s.iid Mcintosh.
"Often times, vou have to go be
yond just reiving on your qu.ilili
cations on your resume to get a
job. fherc is a lot of truth to 'it's
who you know.' "
Lundsteen is in agreement,
stating that networking is the
most important part of a three
step approach tor students who
are currently searching for in
ternships. The other steps are ex
ploring established opportunities,
like Jobtrak or Cardinal Recruit
ing, and identifying industries of
interests and dropping resumes
to specific companies.
"If [students)do all these three
things, there is no way it won't
yield results . . . but it takes
work," Lundsteen said.
Although interviewing tor Car
dinal Recruiting started |an. IS,
Lundsteen said it is never too late
for students to start their search
for the perfect summer job.
"Of course there are more op
tions when one starts early, but it
is never truly too late. You can al
ways create your own opportuni
ties," she said.
