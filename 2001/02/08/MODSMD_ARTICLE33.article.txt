But is this realh a surprise? Is
this realh a reflection of the so
called demoralization of society?
So masturbation and sexual tle
hauchen have become old hat for
todav's teen films. So what? Society
lias progressed significantly in the
past centur\ in terms ol its sexual
comfort level, sexual liberation has
swept ovei society, and teenagers
aren't the onh ones who have been
affected.
It then becomes the (jnestion ol

I he bottom line is that these
movies make studios lots of money.
And, after all, in the words of
Detiner, one of today's sizzling
young stars, "II it's not broke,
they're not going to fix it."
