What do Neil Diamond, pest fxiciiiiiiu
tion and circus folk have in common? W ell
— nothing, Hut they .11 e .ill fcainrrd in "Sav
ing Silverman,' I lollywood's latest answer to
the 20-something football flic k.
A film for the Kritnev Spears generation,
the title refers to the madcap liijuiks nuclei

taken In two buddies. Wavne (Steve Zahn)
and.l). (Jack Black), who are trying to pre
vent their longtime pal, Darren Silverman
(Jason Biggs "Amei i< an Pie") from marrying
cold-hearted Judith (Amanda I Vet of lA'.'s
"Jack and Jill").
1 nclith is hell bent on < out rolling even .is

pect ol Darren's life, from how often they
have sex to who his friends are. When she
breaks up the trio's Neil Diamond cover
hand (Diamonds 111 the Rough), the battle
lines are drawn.
What happens next? Does ii really mat
ter? I'his movie is more about putting unbe
lievable characters and gratuitous cleavage
in ridiculous situations than it is about lol
l< >wing a < aptivating storyline.
('.ranted, notwithstanding Judith's kid
napping and ignoring the fact that the lx»ys
seek out advice from (loach, their cra/ed
high school mentor, the plot is not terribly
off-base. (loach is played by R. lx*e Krmey,
whose firm grasp on the art of bathroom
humoi is truly amazing, given his critically
acclaimed performances in Stanle\
Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket" and Francis
Ford Coppola's "Apocalypse Now."
Who hasn't had a friend who has dated
or, even worse, married the completely
wrong person? I'his was the reasoning of
screenwriters Hank Nelkcn and dreg De-
Paul, who penned "Silverman" after realiz
ing that their real-life butlch was about to fill

till ihis very prophecy.
And who hasn't decided to take matters
into their own hands by kidnapping their
friend's spouse-to-be, faking his or her death
and unabashedly setting their pal up with his
or her long-lost high s< hool sweetheart (in
Darren's case, Sandy, played by Amanda
Detmer), in hopes that he will lot get his most
recent love?
Wayne and J.I), have. And that's not the
worst ol it. When Judith escapes and, once
again, becomes Darren's "puppetmaster,"
(load) and the bovs resort to desperate mea
sures. soliciting Neil Diamond to talk some
sense into their friend to the tune ol the pop
icon's classic hit "Holly Holy."
Implausible? Of course. Is this the prob
lem with "Saving Silverman"? Not reallv.
Some funky hair gel and a flaming terrier
both made " I Something About
Mary" a memorable film, as off-key as it was.
And Biggs gave new meaning to the
phrase,"American l'ic" with his R-rated
romp with baked goods in the 1999 movie of
the same name.

Obviously, outrageous physical comedy
does not automatically signal a bad movie.
But in "Silverman," scenes involving flagrant
physical humor seem strung together hap
hazardly, like there were places in the script
every seven minutes of run time that in
structed the filmmakers to "insert fumn
predicament here."
It's not as though the movie didn't have its
moments. Black is in fine form as J.D., remi
niscent of his portrayal of the irksome Barn
in "High Fidelity." Upon being outwitted In
| uclith in one of her escape attempts, J. I), ex
plains, "She used her super-intellect on me.
She's like Hannibal Letter." And Xahn is en
dearing as Wayne, whose unassuming dis
position and groovy 'stache make him the
perfect bozo.
"Silverman" is an adequate attempt In di
rector Dennis Dugan to recreate the asinine
antics he made famous in"I lappy Ciilmore
and "Big Daddy." Despite a likeable cast and
fairly engaging plot, this late-comer to tin
youth movie pool lacks the strength of s< ript
that ina\ have saved it from mediocritv.
