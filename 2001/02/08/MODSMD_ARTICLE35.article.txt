lu her short stories, Flannery
() ('.on nor perfec led the recipe for
the Southern Gothic st\le: mix a
cupful of religious zealotry into a
(reepy Southern town, spice liber
all\ with outsiders and deviants
and luke until the bizarre epipha
nies begin to occur. In " The (»ift,"
direc tor Sam Raiini is given all the
light ingredients fora Southern
thriller — the murky town of Bi ix
ton (filmed near Savannah, (la.),
and a fantastic cast reach to fill out
a script full of rednecks and

weirdos — but the movie still fails
in its flnnsN architecture.
(late Blanchett plays Annie Wil
son, a recent widow and mother of
three who makes ends meet In pet -
forming psychic readings for Brix
ton's gulliblcs. Apparently, she's an
extremeh talented psychic . Where
most Tarot card readers need the
Death card to frighten their cus
tomers, Blanchett gets In with a

special dec k of onh live < aids: c it
c Irs. squares, siai s, i losses and wax \
lines. In something like a kinder
gat ten game of concentration, the
audic-nc e begins to look for patterns
in the repeated close-ups of the
cards. You know that when slu- Mips
over three wav\ -line < arcls man >\\,
it's a real whamtm — a c haracter's
watery demise is foretold.
()neof Annie's regulai patrons is
Valerie Barksdale, a battered
housewife plaved by Oscar-winner
Milan Swank. Black-eyed and cov
ered in bruises. Swank is .1 cowering
and trembling presence that pro
vokes outrage towards hei abusive
perpetrator. Hut then we discovei
th.it her husband-the meanest,
baddest redneck 111 Brixton, Don
nie Barksdale - is plaved b\ none
othei than keauu Reeves.
Movie bulls know that Robert
DeiMiro gained ,t hundred pounds
to pla\ |akc laMotta 111 "Raging
Bull." while Demi Moore bulled
up and shaved her head inordet to
become a credible (1.1. Jane.
Reeves, seat< hing foi .1 | >li\ su . 11
symbol of Barksdale's evil and trv
ing to erase a lifetime of c ute and
cuddly roles, decides to grow .1
beard and <1 mullet.
So how does the slightl\ furriet
Reeves fare .is a baddie? Surpris
ingh well. I sualh .1 languid, il not
torpid, physical presence, Reeves

manipulates 1 1 is I>»><l\ into striding,
purposeful acts ol malevolence.
Rather tli.m (entering the camera
on Reeves and framing him in
ImkK-worshipping shots, Raimi al
lows him to hurst suddenh into the
camera's frame from unexpected
angles.
Annie's other regular customer
is the town's mechanic, a shambling
wreck ol .1 man haunted In a horri
ble childhood secret. Bilb hob
Thorton, who co-authored the
script with I out I- ppei s< >n. seems to
have a spei 1.11 knack foi imagining
deranged simpletons and ps\
( It otic s (e.g. "Sling Blade").
11 ere. the tot mented 1 harae tei is

ni Rihisi I nfortuuatelv, Ribisi's
palette ol ins and mannerisms
overwhelms the llimsy, one-note
character. He ends up as .1 soil ol
carnival sideshow freak. Ihe
biggest laugh in the entire movie
occurs when Rilnsi confronts
Reeves and demands that Reeves
shoot him.
I he plot hinges on the disap
pearance ol the local sexpot so
cialite, plaved with vamp\ success
In k.itie Holmes, who appears to
have no problem shedding her
"Dawson's (.reek" good-girl image,
along with most of her clothes.
I lolmes is betrothed, but not be

school principal, played In Oreg
kinnear. With his wide-eyed inno
cence and svmpathetic demeanor.
Kinneai Mumediateh becomes, 111
the rules oi (fie horror-genre, one
of the most suspicious characters,
along with Reeves and Rihisi.
But Blanc hett, though she di

remains blind to the murderer's
identitN until the film's close. One

bitter end.
Raimi, no stranger to the horror
genre (e.g. the" Kvil Dead" frilogv),
opens the movie with a creepy,
meditative montage, cutting be
tween shots of 'quiescent mangrove
swamps and Blanc hett s mesmeriz
ing facial features. Die atmosphere
is mist\. almost viscous in its lluid
ness, and it hints .it a slow, thinking
route to occ nit horrors and tin ills.
But, about halfway through the
movie (and after .111 interminable
courtroom sc cue- that c learly should
have been left on the c utting room
floor), R.iinii loses faith and sue
c umbs to the cheap tin ills ol ,1 fran

talents of the cast are wasted on
comic book pulp when thc-\ could
