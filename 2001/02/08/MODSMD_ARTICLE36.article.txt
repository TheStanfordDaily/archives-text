# Edward Yang's Yi Yi astonishes
## 
### RANDY MANO STAFF WRITER 
1 was trul\ puzzled about two things the da\ I saw the Taiwanese
film "Yi Yi (A ()ne and .1 fwo)": In st, how this movie c ould have a
sold out crowd on Super Bowl Sunda\ and. second, how it could be
so much better than its over-hyped counterpart from Hong Kong,
"('.touching Tiger. Hidden Dragon."
"Yi Yi" exudes reality and dramatic sincerity, almost to the- point of
overdoing it, b\ the time the thud act unfolds. I lie- storv foe use-s on N. |

not onb 110111 Ins loved ones, hut also from his place ol employment.

love, Sliei 1 \ (Su-Yun ko). You gal lie-1 from bits and pieces ol inhu -

eyes tnay get a workout from "Yi Yi," but vour mind and heart will be
quite content with the proceedings.
