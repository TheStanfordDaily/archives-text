in the andience seemed to know what w .is

('.loud len. the ('.atiadian pi o< I in i ion

company responsible lot this, lias a suc
cessful histor\ iu marketing the "icli
gious thriller" genre to Christian audi
ences. "Left Behind," theit highest pro
duction to date at 517 million, was actu
all\ released on video months ago, and
it |iuuped to the top of video s.iles lists,
besting competitors like "Toy Story II
and " I lie (ireen Mile" (but not Play
bov's"Best of Pamela Anderson").
Aftci sol it iting <m additional $2 million
marketing kitt\ from Cluistian corpora
tions and (hutches, "Left Behind" aimed
lor the big s< reen. achieving a nationwide
release last week. But make no mistake,
"Left Behind: The Movie" is the same B
gradc fare as "Left Behind: I he Video."
I he movie opens as the camera cuts to
random and hapha/ardlx organized shots
of Jerusalem. We meet "C'.NN" news re
porter Bin k Williams who, while inter
\iewing the creator <>la revolutionary
technologA that allows wheat lobe grown
m the desert, witnesses a massive air as
sault on Israel that lails, strangely, when
the lightet s explode lot no l eason.
Kormet "('.towing Pains" heartthrob
Kuk Cameron dusted off vears of imem
ploMueut m older to pla\ Williams. Willi
his etet nall\ bovish looks and serio-comit

earnestness, Cameron makes for an en
tirely unbelievable war correspondent,
something like the anti-Wolf Blitzer.
Meanwhile, back at the six-minute war,
super-imposed fireballs and shrieking sonic
whines are sprinkled liberally around
Cameron's pretty head. But the visual and
sound elicits come oil as cheap - reminis
cent of 1970s technology that may have
been novel with Star Wars but is now long
outdated.
Williams also has a run in with my (a
\orite « haracter, listed in the < red its only
as "Zombie Man." Zombie Man appears
before Williams, strikes a prophetic pose,
and begins speaking 111 Hebrew, or
tongues, or something. What is more im
portant is that Zombie Man is the spitting
image of the Creat and Might\ Sorcerer
Tim from "Mont\ I'vthon and the Holy
Grail."
Having exhausted his action budget,
Sarin turns to insipid famih drama. Brad
Johnson stars as the Neanderthal airline
pilot Rayford Steele who, after losing Ins
devout wife and innocent son to the Rap
ture, sets himself to figuring out why
(since the ofli< ial word from the I nited
Nations, now the world's government, is
th.it the disappearances were caused l>\

radiation).
Set amid Rayford's personal saga is .i
global conspiracy theory involving tlit
U.N. government, led by my second fa
vorite character, Nicolae Carpathia,
ridiculously named fora mountain range
onl\ to help us locate his accent, which
wanders from Scotland to Russia and li
nally settles near Romania. Gordon Cut
rie, veteran of many B-movies and even .1
few "Beverly Hills 90210" appear,iikes,
plays the part with such awkward relish
that it's easy to guess that he ends up as the
you-know-who.
One by one, the inevitable stages ol tin
Apocalypse are revealed: a global < urren
cy. a world of 10 kingdoms, the rise ol tin
Anti-Christ and so on. I assume that, l<>i
aficionados like the old woman in the .111
dience, this must be the fun of the movie:
Knowing what should happen next and
waiting for it to be revealed 011 screen. But.
in a way, thi> is like watching "Sesame
Street": Knowing how to spell "ter-ri-hle"
and waiting lot Klino to finish putting it i«>
gethei. Whether or not you agree with tlit
ideology, "Left Behind" is a lous\ lilm. In
am standard. Christians might enjo\ tin
overt spiritual message but win not
save $N and go to church?
