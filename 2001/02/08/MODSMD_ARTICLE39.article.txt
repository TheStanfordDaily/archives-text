# Don't hate me because I'm beautiful
## Malena tells tale of beauty and the Italian beach 
### SARAH MEARON EDITORIAL STAFF 
Picture it: (lastelcuto, Sicilv,
I'.MO. Mussolini has pist declared
war on I-ranee and Britain. I lie
husband of the most beautiful
woman in town, Malena (Monit a
belluc i). has gone oil to light for
the fascists. She is left to tend for
hersell amid a vie ions and emhit
tered social mic roc limate that be
(onies heightened as the months
pass and tlu- politi(al situation

worsens.
When news of Malena s hus
band s death reac lies (iastelc uto,
comfort from the acrimonious
townspeople is just as scarce as
(|ualit \ ( ollee and thread, which,
along with mam other goods, are
being used to feed the failing fas
cist war effort.
but "Malena" isn't a film
about the plight ola people .it the
hands ola brutal, albeit exalted
dictator who leads the populace
to the slaughtct as thev naiveh

.iikl lovingb proclaim, "Viva il
flute!" It isn't about the clreadlul
uess ol war. It isn't even about
the pain of loss.
"Malena" is about the victor\
ol the human spirit, but. more
than that, it * hronkles how one
woman transcends the revul
sion and spitelulness ol an en
tire town of people and
emerges from their vengeful
.uid bitter web with her dignit\
intact.
"Malena" is (old through the
eves ol Kenato ((iuiseppe Sul

adoration loi Malena compels
Imn to follow bet evei \ move.
Me watches as she does evcrv
thing from running errands to
caring lot bet infirm fathei to
having a sex ial visit from a
would-be suitor. "Malena" is a
war-eta film that is less about the
war-torn battlefields and more
about the front-line conllids that
rage within individuals.
I his is a lilin wrought with
contrasts. It takes place during
a time when purity and brutal
ity exist in the same plane,

being used to feed the failing fas
cist war effort.
but "Malena" isn't a film
about the plight ola people .it the
hands ola brutal, albeit exalted
dictator who leads the populace
to the slaughtct as thev naiveh

.iikl lovingb proclaim, "Viva il
flute!" It isn't about the clreadlul
uess ol war. It isn't even about
the pain of loss.
"Malena" is about the victor\
ol the human spirit, but. more
than that, it * hronkles how one
woman transcends the revul
sion and spitelulness ol an en
tire town of people and
emerges from their vengeful
.uid bitter web with her dignit\
intact.
"Malena" is (old through the
eves ol Kenato ((iuiseppe Sul

adoration loi Malena compels

Me watches as she does evcrv
thing from running errands to
caring lot bet infirm fathei to
having a sex ial visit from a
would-be suitor. "Malena" is a
war-eta film that is less about the
war-torn battlefields and more
about the front-line conllids that
rage within individuals.
I his is a lilin wrought with
contrasts. It takes place during
a time when purity and brutal
ity exist in the same plane,
feenage boys innocenth scuf

more of their countrymen are

while he is on the battlefield.
Italian writer-dim toi (iuiseppe
rornatore, who rose to promi
nent e more than .1 (let ade ago with
the Oscar-winning "Cinema I'ar
adiso." has ( reated a film that chal
lenges the ethical hygiene of
mankind 111 the most taxing <>t so
cial contexts: war. fornatore begs
the tjiiestion: W hen one's ver\ s.tle
t\ is threatened b\ the det isions of
.1 depraved politital leader, throw
ing the essence ol one's daih life
into disarray, is 11 possible to re
main civil to the neighbt»rs?
From tilt- perverse cominen
-1 a 1 \ ol the sex-starved men lo the
< .illous gossip ol the sun-baked

women who follow Malena every
where slit- goes in Castelcuto, the
answer is no. 111 spite of being
faithful to her husband while he is
away at war and in spite of never
gixing the townspeople the satis
faction of reacting to their cutting
comments, Malena is ever the ob
ject of ridicule and disrespect
from her fellow citi/ens.
I lei lone defender is Kenato, a
box ripe with pubescence, who,
despite the fact tli.it lie drapes a
p.lit of lat \ underpants swiped
from her < lothesliuc over his face
.is be pleasures himself lo sleep, is
nonetheless most lox.il to and re
spectFul of the Sicilian he.uitx.
Ilia town where even Malena "s
own father cluitkles as voting
boxs tlestribe how they'd like to
"give it to her, Kenato is a devot-

Ed disciple of hers, refusing to
give into the mob mentality that
has engulfed the populace.
If not lor the graceful swell of
her bosom, Malena probably
would not have been branded a
scapegoat for atown drowning in
the turmoil of war and social up
heaval. II not for the steady
strength of her character, she
would not have been able to re
turn i<> C.astelcuto after being
painlulh rejected l>\ its citizens.
A visually stimulating film
v\hose esseiu e lies in the gestures
and expressions of its characters,
"Malena" captivates with its
humor and astonishes with its
hrutalitv. In ii a complex storv?
\<>. Is it without elaborate depic
tion? IVrhaps. Is it worth seeing?
Absolutely.
