that (Ik- album

"Pat at hutes" is .111 album that m\ ites vou to get to know
11 bettei N'on might not lind .ill that vou are looking lor
initialh it's nothing we've never heard before. I low
evei, iinu hof the album's a» hievement lies in its latent
emotional power; the rest lies in its indieation of (lold
pla\'s \.ist potential.
I he album's opener. "Don't Panicis .1 hauutingh

Martin reminds ns. "We live in .1 beautiful world
Yeah we do, veah we do," matched with the poignant
vet se: "Bones, sinking like stones All that we Ibuglit fbi
I lomes, plan s we've grown All of 11s are done lor.' In
the laeeol det a\ lies the promise ol joy: "There's noth
ing here to mil from And veah, even-body here's got
somebod\ to lean oil."
I lie onl\ dt awbai ks are that the song is .1 mere two
minutes and Iseconds long, leaving yon d\ ing to heat
more, and that it sets .1 standard which proves impossi
ble to mate h throughout the rest ol the album.
"Don't Panic" will, unfortunately. nevei In- a single.
Rumoi has it" I n >u!>ie is set to be (!oldpla\ s next release.
"Trouble" lat ks the emotional accessibility ol "Yellow" and
"Don't Panu It's as if. 111 the live minutes it (ills, the band
still can't find the song's direction, l'he song lails to reat b
a (limax. lingering in sean h ol something more.
From this point on (tracks six through 10), "Para
chutes" begins to lag. I liable to keep up with the in
tensity the album establishes initially. the l\ lies become
repetitive and the listenei loses interest. Compare the
lyric. "I nevei meant to( ause noii trouble And I never
meant to do \ou wrong, from the song "1 rouble,' to
the hi ic, "Now I never meant to do you wrong lhat's
what I» aine bete to sa\." from the song "I.ile is tor 1 .i\
ing." I here's a discrepant v there.
Perhaps this album is best summed up 111 the ly lies ol
its title I rat k: "I'll be lo\ ing vou alwavs. always/1 lere lam
and I'll lake m\ time. You have to wonder who the lucky
girl is She and I will be eagerly awaiting Coldplav's next
release. All 111 all. "Parachutes" is a solid debut perfor
