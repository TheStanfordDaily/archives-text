" Turbo's Tunes'" is I lit- new Kill
Rink Si.us proiuotioii.il compila
tion, released |an. 2001. As \ou
might have guessed, tins ( I) does
not contain numerous songs
recorded l>\ a single band, .is so
m.im albums do. Rather.it is <0111-

posed of main songs, each record
ed bv .1 different artist, all of whom
happen to be members of the
(>l\ mpia-hased Kill Rot k Stars lam
il\ (as the term "compilation" may

liave .illead\ suggested to vou).
While I could 11a to review the
compilation .is ,i cohesive whole,
this plan doesn't realb make tuncli
sense. Tew among vou will be run
ning out tobu\ .1 promotional com
pilation ill.it in.i\ not even lx* coin
men ialh available. I believe ib.it in
stead, and mrred me here it I'm
wrong, I should just s.i\ a lew words
.ibout c.k h .ntist on the (ID in the
hopes that some <>l vou miglu be
Â«ome interested and end up buving
one ol the lectured bands' latest al
bums. Since I don't he.u .in\ objec
tions, we sh.ill continue with the
aforementioned plan.
The (.ossip's song,"(iot All I "his
Waiting,'' kicks oil the CIV Their
sound is sonltul and emotional with
playful lemale vocals laid over con
tagious lour chord guitar rills. The
C.ossip, originalb hailing from

Searcy, Ark., and nou l<x ated in the
Pa< ili( Northwest, have been get
ting a lot ol lo< al press latch and lot
good reason. Simple chord pro
gressions and snipped down pro
duction techniques lend I he (.os
sip a (harming garage aesthetic
that's haul to dislike.
I lie next track comes to us (otir
tes\ ol rhe Hangs, a female led, sec
ond-wave, post-punk ensemble.
rhe\'ve released some great music
in the past, but their song on this
sampler,"lnto You," has ditliculty
standing out in the < rowd.
Sleatet Kinney, a melodic le
male three piece, deliver the next
song. I 'hey're arguably one of the
better known bands on the Kill
R.xk Stats label, though their traik
on this compilation, "Ballad ola I a
d\ man," doesn't help a first time lis
tenet understand why . It's uniinag
inative, droning and does little to
highlight Corin I'ticket's generally
phenomenal y<x als.
1 wo I on Boa's track, "Bleeding
Mean," is sludgy, thick and slow.
I he song creates the musk al equiv
alent of the ambiance in a mortuary'
waiting room. Want to scare your
roommates? Pit k this one up.
Kleenex's song, "Liseger Wind."
is a hard-edged pop punk anthem
featuring simultaneous dual female
vocaltsts, frequent beat changes,
plenty of la-la-las, clapping and a
chord progression |oan Kmrv could
teach a Rieses Monkey to plav.

I lolly (lolighdy showcases her
talent on the s.nnplet" with a slow
loafing song titled. "Rain Down
Rain." I'm not familiar with the- rest
of her work, but this track makes
her sound like a female cross be
tween johnm (lash and Stephen
Merrill front 1 "lit* Magnetic 112 ields.
('adallaca's "The I rouble yvitli
Public Places" stiu k out m tin mind
as one ol the most lyrically intelli
gent tracks on the compilation. It's
hard not to be sucked in by these
jaded ladies' infectious disgust for
youth c ulture.
Slumber Party gives us the track
"Any Other Day."a slow-moving
ballad with .i haunting melody and
syrupy-sad vocals.
Lois Mafleo & Brendan Canty's
track, " Being Blind," is a subtle lit
tle song with great melodic female
leads. Yes, that's Brendan Canty,
thedrutntner lor Kuga/.i.hut Fttga/i
f.ms lieware. this side-project beat s
little resemblance to his work with
the famous D.C. punk hand.
Lite Breakdowns deliver a fun
track called, "Try ing to Live." They
have a hip, countrified, twang)'
sound and lyric s like. "Well it cost
itte a dollar five Fora record by
|ohnuy Cash I o get my mind into
a flash Smoking ccxaine mash."
Bonfire Madigan have an almost
ok bestial ovet-prtxluced aesthetic
and punchy vocals. 'Hie track, "Les
son in Ride," on this sampler fea
tures clean percussion and sitings

behind repetitive l\ tit s, with .1 hit of
anihient noise thrown in 101 good
measure. It's better than I make it
sound.
I nwound's track, "Mknltra," is
pulsating and slow with tliuk gui
tars, a loud bass track and relativeh
(jniet, indecipherable Ivrics. I n
wound has been around lor a while
and has become something of a leg
endan group. That said, I didn't
likr this track, but, who knows, vou
might.
Jim (Carroll's song, "Hairshirt
Fracture," 00/es soul from even
chord change. The air in a room
takes on a sort ol psychedelic ennui
when subjected to his gently drift
ing voice. Do your record collection
a favor and pic k up his latest LP.
Sport Murphy is \ ft another po
etic powerhouse 011 the Washing
ton scene. 1 can't sav enough about
lyrics like, " I lie summer was assur
ing 1 lie circus came to Sodom /It
didn't mean .1 thing to me/'('anse I
was born in Autumn / Ask all the
planet's bright ideas and all the
st hinucks that thought 'em / Where
nothing's bright as it appears except
the golden Autumn." Pick up a cop)
ol this one and laugh 'till vou churn
die.
