Main Americans have not heard eels's superb "Daisies ol the
(ialawrhose who have heard it include a lew »1 it its, many of whom
have put it 011 their end-of-year lists, and .1 handful ol dedicated I.ins.
I he album addresses the loss ola parent, which isn't exacth the sub
ject matter lor a hit record from a band whose last, and onlv, success

was lour years ago. (For the record,
"Novoc aine lor the Soul" was eels's.)
I tilortunatelv. because, as the few
1 lit its and fans u ho actual I \ own the
album can attest, it is ultimate!) up
lifting — a wistful and upbeat
< atharsis.
At the time of "Daisies," eels

,ind lead singer K. had put out live albums using these two aliases and,
111 De<ember, with the help ol the Internet, 11ic\ made it six I'he live
"()h What a beautiful Morning (At tistDirect) is not likcl\ to get them
the recognition they deserve. Like "Daisies." it is a low-kev effort.
I low ever, also like "Daisies," it is worth notice.
before "Morning" s official release, the audio ol the entire album
was available at www.eelsthehatid.com, which .ilso includes an assot t -
ment ol band trivia. Including a band biograph\ and musi( videos.
but these promotional goodies wouldn't niattei il the live album
didn't oiler anything over the studio versions ol the same songs. I 01
tmiateb , it does. The album takes a few spins on the turntable to weave
its spell, but its 17 tracks will em 'hat it .111 \ listener who gives it the time
lo do s<>. I n addition to live \ ersious ol .ill mm tracks. there arc Iwo b
sidcs. two covei s (oldies "Keeling (iood and the title track), one in
strumental and oiii' spoken-word perloi uiance. the hilarious "Hot
.111(1 (old."
Songs are presented in one ol two veisions: a lone, \et effective I
with onl\ .111 acoustic guitar or piano, and I ba( ked l>\ bat kup singei s
.ind .1 lull band dubbed "The eels ( )k lustra 20(H)."
< )l course, since the\ didn't pla\ huge venues, si\ people had to jug
gle the duties ol the entire band, including notable underground .11 tist

that rocks 011 " Fl\ swatter, swings on Rod get sand I lanimerstein's "()li
What a beautiful Morning" and breaks \<>ui heart on "('.limbing to the
Moon
\s with an\ compilation, it is eas\ to complain about what is left oil
ol the album — not.ibb the two eels songs with signilic ant 1 aclio pla\:
Novoc aine" and "Last Stop: This I own. Fan favorites like "I lospital
I ood" and T.S.: You Rock M\ World" are also absent. |atiis and ban
ter do not occur mid-song, as tlie\ did in main live shows.
These omissions portrav the band as much tamer than their live
shows and albums reveal them to he and, presumably, than the\ ac tu
alb are. 111 spite of these issues, "Morning' is an excellent album, .1
quiet record for those in a rellective mood or anyone siinpb wanting
some soothing, but thoughtful songs.
I nfortunatelv, the first part ol this decade doesn't seem like a time
111 which people want to feel real emotions 01 to c (intern plate tlu real
it\ of life, at least not through pop music. Alienation sells (witness Ra
diohead), while emotion alienates. ()r it could just be, as 112 surmises,
"We're probablv never gonna he reallv h'g betause there's not gonna
be an\ word of mouth about us 'cause our lans don't have am friends.
I'm kinda proud of that in a wav. It's kind ol nice to have the outcasts.
Outcast or not, it's <1 good idea to check out either of eels albums
from last year — "Oh What a Beautiful Morning" 01 "Daisies of the
(ialaw." Kxpel a few mournful demons and then have fun.
