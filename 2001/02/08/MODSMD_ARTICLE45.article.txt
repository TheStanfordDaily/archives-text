I he pl.t\ is peppet ed Willi this kind ol dr\

of Knglish litei ature, is a scholar of the 17tli

"And death shall he no more, death, thou
shalt die — lias alwavs heen the most chal
lenging of these puzzles. Should a semi colon
replace the liisi comma? Should "death he
capitalized?
From an intellectual standpoint, Vivian
has the "corret t translation all figured out:
"And Death shall he no more; death, thou
shalt die!" But as she finds herself nearing
her own death, in the most non-literar\
sense, intellet tual complit ations give \\.i\ to .1
simple understanding of life and death, more
grounded in human 1 elation ships than in the
intellet t. As Vivian tells us, "I always thought
being smart would take care of it. But I see
I've been found out.
