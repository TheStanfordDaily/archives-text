After the alcohol related death of a
Bloomsberg (College student, Ralph Cas
tro, manager of the Alcohol and Other
Drug Abuse Prevention Program at (low
ell Student Health ('.enter, wants stu
dents to be more aware of the importance
of alcohol management.
"There have been at least six to 10 al
cohol-related deaths in colleges in the
past three years. One-and-a-half years

ago, .1 student at I 'C-Davis died and,
more recently, a student .it Chico State,'
('.astro said.
Adrian I leidenian, a college freshman
at Chico State University and a Palo Alto
native, was found dead of an alcohol
overdose in his fraternity house last Oc
tober. His mother said th.it her son had
very little experience with alcohol and
had alwavs been the designated driver in
high school.
('.astro sees a trend in these deaths.

they were isolated events —hut now
