After the alcohol related death of a
Bloomsberg (College student, Ralph Cas
tro, manager of the Alcohol and Other
Drug Abuse Prevention Program at (low
ell Student Health ('.enter, wants stu
dents to be more aware of the importance
of alcohol management.
"There have been at least six to 10 al
cohol-related deaths in colleges in the
past three years. One-and-a-half years

ago, .1 student at I 'C-Davis died and,
more recently, a student .it Chico State,'
('.astro said.
Adrian I leidenian, a college freshman
at Chico State University and a Palo Alto
native, was found dead of an alcohol
overdose in his fraternity house last Oc
tober. His mother said th.it her son had
very little experience with alcohol and
had alwavs been the designated driver in
high school.
('.astro sees a trend in these deaths.
"When the first two incidents [of alco

hol-related deaths] happened, I thought
something must have gone wrong — that
they were isolated events —hut now
there are one to two deaths a vear," (.as
tro reported.
According to Castro, students often do
not know how to drink responsibly.
"What students need to understand is
that mote is not better. It's part of what I
call the Alcohol Fallacy.' When two
drinks make me feel good, two, four, six
more will triple my positive feelings," ex
plained Castro.

Some students do not think that drink
ing is necessarih a set ions problem at
Stanford.
"I don't think the environment is all
that conducive to an overdose, but what
manv don't realize is jusi how mm h al< o
hol has to he consumed in a vcr\ short
while to overdose, s.iid freshman
Nathalie (iassi<l\.
"We need to he able to model ate. said
Castro. "We lose track, doing multiple
shots or pla\ ing drinking games like ( en
turvClubor Beet Pinu-Poim.

( .istto's most import,ml warning in
lli.it students art* not immune to tlie* ri
le* ts of alcohol. I lowe\er, he emphasized
that he is asking students to he responsi
ble. not to stop drinking entirely.
"I'm a sot i.il drinker. I ve learned to
he responsible. I tome from that per
spective. Part ol m\ job is outreach. 1
work \\itli I'l 1I s, RAs, athletes. (ii eeks,
freshmen and other risk groups. 1
probably hit the majority of dorms, es-
penally freshman dorms," he
said.
Castro praises the environ
ment on campus .is one tli.it em
powers students to be i esponsible
about drinking and contributes to
a caring attitude toward other
students.
"We've averted death because
we come and act. The students
aren't bystanders. Thcv will step
up and say, 'This person needs
some medical attention,' " Castro
said.
Students also praise the Stan
ford's policies on alcohol use.
"I feel the University's policy
on alcohol contributes to an at
mosphere much more conducive
to personal choice. Stanford
avoids becoming a 'police state'
focused only on enforcement,
while students learn to become
more responsible with their dec i
sions," freshman Chris Andrews
said.
("astro highlighted the impor

tance of an open environment in
the dorms.
" I he RA's role is to fostei a car
ing, healthy community, not to
police dorms and < onfisc ate .i!< o
hol. Students are mot e willing to
discuss issues. We have entities
that cle.il with cntorc cment. Po
lice can pic k.i person up toi being
chunk in public. Police have .in
obligation to cite a minor in pos
session," C lastro said.
Cassidv also ac knowledged the
benefits of a relaxed drinking pol
icy in the dorms.
"Because the atmosphere is so
open to drinking, more people
are going to be watching out for
others who are drinking and will
recognize when someone li.is had
too much to drink."
('.astro encouraged students to
watch out for themselves and for
others.
"It there's a tone I want to set.
it's that students should set a re
sponsible norm. We are all role
models for each other. We want
to encourage a fun. productive
dorm culture. If we are responsi
ble for eac li other, we can make .i
difference."
