Defining such a plan was noeasy task for

ton. In fact, the (ieneral I se Permit was
approved unanimously .it a time ol great
anti-growth sentiment, and 00 percent of
people polled approve of its measures."

Indeed. "Stanford s development plans
have been met with a great deal of support,
but this h.is not alwa\s been apparent in
the press, which has sensationalized the
issue, Morton continued. "Yen strong
objections have been made, but onl\
among a small group ol people."
"Stanford is not .i hit-and-run develop
er." (iovernment and ( onmiunity Rela

lions intern Fvan Nordb\ added. "When
people sa\ we need to he treated like other
groups, it's ,i talse comparison, because we
are not developing in an attempt to make a
profit."
"Most ot the objections from neighbors
are generalized — not directed against
Stanford — but rather reflect a concern
about ,111 increase in traffic that mav come
with development," said I lotion.
I lus should not be taken to impl\ that
the opposition lias not made a substantial
impact on how people have viewed and
judged Stanford's development plans.
Petei Dreknieier, of the Stanford Open
Space Mliance, has been Stanford's main
opponent i uiuiing .111 .id campaign funda
mentalh targeted at demonstrating that
the foothills are 111 danger.
" I he\ ha\c given a \er\ distorted pic
ture of Stanford's intentions." I lotion said.
"It's lairh aina/ing that people assume
that Stanford is on one side of the spectrum
and en\lioiunentalists are on the other,
Nordb\ added. "Stanford lies 111 the mid
dle: We have taken the environment 11110
.m ount 111 making our plans."
Denise Dade of the (onunittee for

(•teen Foothills, an organization that
works hand 111 hand with SC )SA. disagrees,
citing as evidence a C arnegie Foundation
Proposal that calls for the construction of a
2.100 square-foot office facilitv with a 40-
car parking lot to be built southof |unipero
Serra Boulevard, an area that was sup
posed to be protected bv the academic
grow th boundary.
"Stanford ran a campaign that said that
there would be no development in the
Foothills, and the communit\ doesn't un
derstand that the Carnegie Foundation
Proposal goes against what the\ stated,"
1 )acle said.
It should be noted that .1 board of su
pervisors met to discuss the Carnegie
Foundation proposal on I uesdav, but an
official decision on the issue has been de
laved until the board reconvenes 011 March
20.
1 lie ('.onunittee tor (ireen Foothills is
currently campaigning 011 behalf of a sus
tainable build-out plan, under which "the
count\ must define Stanford's maximum
build-out potential," 1 )ade said."()ur hope
is that the efforts ot the communit\ to es
tablish a strong academic growth bound

arv is respected bv the I niversitv. Fhere
should also be a significant open spat e plan
to protect environmentally sensitive
areas."
Meanwhile, I lorton continued to inain
tain, "Stanford has been an excellent stew
ardess of hinds. Jasper Ridge Biological
Preservation and the academic growth
boundary are only two examples ot the
major contributions Stanford has made to
the environment."
I he ongoing debate between the I ni
versitv and environmental groups c reates
controversy lor members ot the communi
ty who find it difficult to grasp a firm un
derstanding ot future plans tor develop
ment and preservation.
"I think it's ridiculous that the Foothills
are used as a political football." freshman
I .van Fox said, commenting on the (un cut
situation.
With the prosperity the I niversit\ has
brought to the region, the need to period
ic ally redefine land use guidelines in the tu
ture seems inevitable. I lowever, it remains
to be seen it rontrovci s\ surrounding the
Foothills will hindet the establishment ot
development plans.
