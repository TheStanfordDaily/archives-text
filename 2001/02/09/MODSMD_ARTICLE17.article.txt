# SALAD DAYS' LAST STAND
## Survival rules morality 
### JOSHUA KIENITZ GUEST COLUMNIST 
Mov. lis arc weird concepts. On
one hand, ihcv arc kind ol
neat, like when von help an
old lad\ at toss die street. ()n
the other hand, thev can he quite restric
tive, like when yon can onl\ cat Hebrew
National brand kosher hot dogs.
Sometimes morals are great, like when
vour beloved girlfriend savs she would
tui'er che.tt on her man. But sometimes
they reallv get in the way, like when vou
feel guilt\ about getting .1 five-finger dis
count at the Stanford Bookstore.
So we're faced with a dilemma. Arc
morals dope, or are they lamer Should we
keep them around ft>l a few more veai s. 01
throw them out with yesterday's hash
pipe?
We got into .in illuminating discussion
in one of in\ classes last week. Here's the
situation. A horribh contagious virus is
sweeping the entire globe. Once people
contract it. thev have onlv si\ months to
live. There have been billions of deaths,
and most of the survivors arc alrcad\ in
fected. ft is clear that, in a couple of
months, barring a miracle, everyone will
be dead.
But there's a rav of light. Because of
some complex chemical thing, the viius
affects onlv those who have gone
through puberty. Most people who arc
12 years old or younger will survive.
Thev will survive, and the virus will be
gone because all of the carriers will be
dead. It will be .111 entirely new world,
populated by preteens.
The question is: W hat kind of morals
should we instill in these youngsters?
What do we teach them about right and
wrong in this desperate hour?
The small c lass immediately split into
rival camps. Some of us thought we should
pic k the oldei kids and give them a c rash
course in leadership. Others thought we
shouldn't define leaders because that
would lead to the same sort of oppressive
patriarchy that we have todav. And then
there were three athletes who sat together
at one end of the table and were so deep in
thought that the\ didn't say «« single thing
during the rest of the class.
I hc tension boiled down to two models
of moral instruction. One model tried to
make the new society into an egalitarian
democracy where nobody fights, every
l)t>dv listens to everyone else without in
terrupting, the girls arc good at math and
the Im)\s breast-feed the c hildren.

I lu' second model would recommend
starting out with .111 authoritarian oli
garchs in which some kids were strict 1\ re
sponsible tor gathering food, others Tor
taking< are of the inlaiits and toddlers and
still others foi enforcement of rules.
I he lii st model sounds |>u-tt\ tad. until
vou see how kids are when the\ are unsu
pervised b\ adults. Flic hHighest ho\ s heat
up the other ones, and the\ make the
rules. An authoritarian oligarchy, to he
sure.
So. antit ipating this, wouldn't it he bet
ter to identify the biggest and strongest
,ind teach them the things the\ need to
know . like how to di i\e a car. how to plant
corn, how to purih water, win nottoe.it
yellow snow and so on. I he\ would then
p.iss down this knowledge through the
emergent hierat < h\.
An <."galit.il ian deinoi 1 ac\ doesn't seem
plausible with preteens in extreme cir
cumstances. What if the 7- and S-\e.u -olds
decided the\ no longer want to t.ike care
oftheyoungei kids? What ifthe ( .)-and 10-
vear-olds decided the\ no longet want to
help out with getting food? I here's not a
lot of latitude for individual opinion when
sin \ ival is at stake.
Anvwav, the professoi agreed with me,
saving that implanting morals of (I) eon tor
init\ to rules and ( l 2)dut\ to serve fellow hu
mans would be the best bet. 1 hen, of
course, in a generation or so. once there
were some adults w ho know what w as going
on, once everyone's figured out how to sin -
vive and maintain a stable societ\, vou could
go ahead and add 111 some extra morals.
Everyone should have the right to vote,
babies need to be dipped in water and
blessed In a shaman. You can't eat meat on
Fridays. That sort of thing.
Which brings me back to mv original
question. Ito morals sut k? ()r are thev cool?
M\ answer is somewhere in between. Some
morals are necessary for survival, but then
when we've figured out all the hard stuff,
like where to find water and how to keep
food from rotting, moral systems can |ust
spin out ot control, and we've got all these
unnecessary rules.
So I 'd encourage all of us to look at our
own moral systems and just keep the
cream of the crap. And then write that
down. My opinion is that all the important
stufl should fit on a business card, which
you can then keep in your wallet.

M\ answer is somewhere in between. Some
morals are necessary for survival, but then
when we've figured out all the hard stuff,
like where to find water and how to keep
food from rotting, moral systems can |ust
spin out ot control, and we've got all these
unnecessary rules.
So I 'd encourage all of us to look at our
own moral systems and just keep the
cream of the crap. And then write that
down. My opinion is that all the important
stufl should fit on a business card, which
you can then keep in your wallet.

Mov. lis arc weird concepts. On
one hand, ihcv arc kind ol
neat, like when von help an
old lad\ at toss die street. ()n
the other hand, thev can he quite restric
tive, like when yon can onl\ cat Hebrew
National brand kosher hot dogs.
Sometimes morals are great, like when
vour beloved girlfriend savs she would
tui'er che.tt on her man. But sometimes
they reallv get in the way, like when vou
feel guilt\ about getting .1 five-finger dis
count at the Stanford Bookstore.
So we're faced with a dilemma. Arc
morals dope, or are they lamer Should we
keep them around ft>l a few more veai s. 01
throw them out with yesterday's hash
pipe?
We got into .in illuminating discussion
in one of in\ classes last week. Here's the
situation. A horribh contagious virus is
sweeping the entire globe. Once people
contract it. thev have onlv si\ months to
live. There have been billions of deaths,
and most of the survivors arc alrcad\ in
fected. ft is clear that, in a couple of
months, barring a miracle, everyone will
be dead.
But there's a rav of light. Because of
some complex chemical thing, the viius
affects onlv those who have gone
through puberty. Most people who arc
12 years old or younger will survive.
Thev will survive, and the virus will be
gone because all of the carriers will be
dead. It will be .111 entirely new world,
populated by preteens.
The question is: W hat kind of morals
should we instill in these youngsters?
What do we teach them about right and
wrong in this desperate hour?
The small c lass immediately split into
rival camps. Some of us thought we should
pic k the oldei kids and give them a c rash
course in leadership. Others thought we
shouldn't define leaders because that
would lead to the same sort of oppressive
patriarchy that we have todav. And then
there were three athletes who sat together
at one end of the table and were so deep in
thought that the\ didn't say «« single thing
during the rest of the class.
I hc tension boiled down to two models
of moral instruction. One model tried to
make the new society into an egalitarian
democracy where nobody fights, every
l)t>dv listens to everyone else without in
terrupting, the girls arc good at math and
the Im)\s breast-feed the c hildren.

I lu' second model would recommend
starting out with .111 authoritarian oli
garchs in which some kids were strict 1\ re
sponsible tor gathering food, others Tor
taking< are of the inlaiits and toddlers and
still others foi enforcement of rules.
I he lii st model sounds |>u-tt\ tad. until
vou see how kids are when the\ are unsu
pervised b\ adults. Flic hHighest ho\ s heat
up the other ones, and the\ make the
rules. An authoritarian oligarchy, to he
sure.
So. antit ipating this, wouldn't it he bet
ter to identify the biggest and strongest
,ind teach them the things the\ need to
know . like how to di i\e a car. how to plant
corn, how to purih water, win nottoe.it
yellow snow and so on. I he\ would then
p.iss down this knowledge through the
emergent hierat < h\.
An <."galit.il ian deinoi 1 ac\ doesn't seem
plausible with preteens in extreme cir
cumstances. What if the 7- and S-\e.u -olds
decided the\ no longer want to t.ike care
oftheyoungei kids? What ifthe ( .)-and 10-
vear-olds decided the\ no longet want to
help out with getting food? I here's not a
lot of latitude for individual opinion when
sin \ ival is at stake.
Anvwav, the professoi agreed with me,
saving that implanting morals of (I) eon tor
init\ to rules and ( l 2)dut\ to serve fellow hu
mans would be the best bet. 1 hen, of
course, in a generation or so. once there
were some adults w ho know what w as going
on, once everyone's figured out how to sin -
vive and maintain a stable societ\, vou could
go ahead and add 111 some extra morals.
Everyone should have the right to vote,
babies need to be dipped in water and
blessed In a shaman. You can't eat meat on
Fridays. That sort of thing.
