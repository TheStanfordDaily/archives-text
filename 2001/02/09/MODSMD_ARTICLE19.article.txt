Student's comments perpetuate stigma
against mental illness
I found Stair's comments in his Feb. S
letter ("Mental illness article provokes
questions") to he quite disturbing. I reallv
hope he wasn't implying that people with
mental illnesses are hiding behind medi
tation. 1 further hope he wasn't implying
that people with mental illnesses are
avoiding changing their "unhealthy" be
havior simph because the\ lack the self
discipline to do so.
It that is what he is itnph mg. then I hope
that he will follow his own advice, and next
time he has a cold, a flu or a headache, he

will avoid taking any sort ol medication that
c ould help him feel better. I really hope he
will instead change his "unhealthy" habits
of exposing himself to illness.
It's fine to question wliv we are seeing
an increase in mental illness. 1 hat is a dis
turbing trend that needs to be examined,
but don't imph that bv seeking treat
ment, that will involve medication allow
ing these people to function normally,
the\ are somehow cheating and avoiding
actual treatment. Doing so perpetuates
the stigma that societx has against mental
illness.
