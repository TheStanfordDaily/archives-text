# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Natural disaster, political corruption plague El Salvador 
### MARK EISNER GUEST COLUMNIST 
In the past month, earthquakes in II
Salvador and India have killed tens
of thousands and displaced over a
million more. I he horrific suffer
ing shocked us. We max feel frustrated
from oui inability to help the victims. Htit
xvc must understand th.u, though ilns
was a natural disaster, the sexeritx to
xvhich the miserv maligns El Salxadon
ans is an unconscionable injustice of pol
itics and povertx that could have been
prevented.
Through unsustainable and unjust ap
proaches to development, the earth
quake s etlecis have been compounded l>\
human error. And it continues to be so
through the politic i/ation ot relief aid and
the lack ot ajust and sustainable plan ol re
construction.
For example, El Salvador's president
Francisco Florcs, essentiallx prix.iti/ed the
government's relict ettoi ts nndei the name
of his oxvn right-xving ARENA party. I lie
"National Solidaritx (lomniittee" that he es
tablished to coordinate the gox'ernnient's
response is a complete misnomer. I lie
committee is comprised almost entirelx ol
private businessmen affiliated with AREN A
or its coalition.
Not one member ot the opposition
I'MEN xvas included. 1101 xvas the partici
pation ol N(l()s and communitx groups
alloxved. 1 he committee's head, Roberto
Murrax Me/a. jnsi happenstobe ARI \ \'s

most likelx presidential candid.ite tor

Manx ot the communities hit hardest bx
the earthquake are governed In the
I'MEN. I bex have received xen littleaid.il
anx. fhe spokesman ol the I MEN gov
erned municipalitx ol Santa I'ecla had to
(|uestion aid efforts.
"We don't know what [the central gov
ernment] is doing — whether it's out of
negligence oi incapacitx—hut the need
here is immense and iliex haxe sciit neither
food nor medit me. he said. I he onlx aid

I hough the national goxernnient lias

aid. the liisi official relief shipment to the
toxvn ol 1 .a I 'a/1 (insisted «it two mattresses,
one pound ol spaghetti, three pounds of
salt and one high-heeled shoe.
Nearlx a month after the quake, II hos
pitals are still damaged. Children, regard

from the lack ol iooil. Patients teai cholera

ed. not bx the goxernnient nor the interna
tional community, but In the A REN \partx
itself I here haxe also been repoiis of offi
cials stockpiling supplies and exen selling
them on the street.
but the goxernnient s handling ol the
relief monex has not been the onlx lactoi to

worsen the earthquake's d.linage. I ntler
the influence aiul pressure ot the Interna
tional Monetarx Fmul, the World Bank
and the I S government, unsustainable de
velopment programs centered around
structural adjustment polities have been
implemented.
()ne ol the major implications ot stu ha
polio has been severe eut-backs in stn i.il
set \ ices at a time when halt the countr\ < an
not meet b.isii neetls such as food, housing
and health. \earlx a quarter of the coun
trx s women tannot read and write. 1 lie
goxet nment could not pro\ ide scan h-and
itscue teams, recovery dogs or special
equipment when the crisis began.
I heollit lal rescue operation onl\ began
when inlet national teams arrivetl. Mean
while. the go\eininent is sitting on $435
million I S dollars the\ set aside to stabilize
the implementation of theii controversial
doll.ll i/.tlion p|.in.
\eoliberal policies have also resulted in
increasing povertx and irreversible envi
-1 <Himcntal (Icgradation.
According to Daniel l abel, author ot
"Lnvironment I nder l ire . I I Salvador is
| >i-i haps the most environmentalh dam
aged countn in the hemisphere. Less than
pert en tot the land remains forested.
()vei ID pel cent ot land determined eco
logit all\ fragile has been developed. More
than 77 pen cut of 1.l Salvadoi sutlers from
serious soil erosion, so the countr\ is prone
to landslides and flash flooding. I wo per
cent of the population owns til) percent of
the land.

I he poor, lacking at cess to detcut land,
arc pushed oft and ton etl to li\e in unsuit
able housing built on soit. preiarious. bro
ken soil on steep hillsides and in tlootl
planes — the plates most vulnerable to
earthquakes or heaw rain.
In the town of Santa let la, the\ have
long feared that deforestation, manipula
tion and rape ot the mountain above them
would cause at atastrophic landslide. I hex
unsutiesstullx pleaded to I I Salvador's
('.ongress and petitioned the Supreme
('.ourt.
So development benefited the few. Pri
vate estates with gatehouses and swimming
jjools in one ot the world's poorest coun
tries xvere built on top of once-healthx
steeps. I«ind that could not support such
const ruction.
I hose in the tow n belox\ t ould not have
predicted the timing of |anuarx s earth
quake, but it plaxetl out their fears: I lie
mountain t rumbled and slid, burxing
tlicit streets in a l.ikeof mud, death and de
strut tion. More than *i(X> died right there.
"What gotxl does inonex do us it we're

Here at Stanford, the ( enter for Latin

Besides immediate aid, we innst .tlso
