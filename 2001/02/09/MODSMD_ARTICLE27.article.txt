\\ nli ()regon and Stanford the
No. 1 .iiul No. 2 teams, respective
l\. in Pat 10 Held goal percentage,
one would figure that last night's
(< >i it est would he a high-sn )iing of
fensive battle. I fowever. .is t\ pital
l\ happens when two well
si hooled Ic.inis meet, il w;is the de
fense that led the way.
"Oregon is a an excellent
team, said head coach I ara Van-
Dcrveer. "We realh worked hard
defensively and did well on the
hoards. Most of all. we hit the kev

shots down the stretch."
I he (Cardinal win avenges a dis
astrous 72-54 loss up in Eugene,
which left Stanford at 1-3 in the
Pac-1() and at arguably its lowest
point of the season.
"Il is realh a credit to the char
acter of our team and how hard we
have worked to improve." Van-
Derveer s.iid. "Our team has im
proved upon the weaknesses the
coai hing staff has pointed out and
is doing what thev need to do."
In the game at M«uArthur
Court, the Duck's Jamie Craig
head hit five 3-pointers, destroy
ing the Cardinal from beyond the
arch. In tonight's battle, Craig
head was denied even a single 3-
point basket and onlv tallied five
points in the game.
"1 told the team that |amic
( .raighead was not going to hit a 3
tonight," VanDerveer said. "We
staved player-to-player the whole
game, and the kids did what they
needed to do."
Oregon and Stanford battled
back and forth throughout the
opening 10 minutes, each strug
gling to generate am type of shot.
Stanford junior Corey En
ghusen did an excellent job limit
ing the offense of ()rcgon's 0-foot
*.") center Jenny Mowe, tallying two
• l)l(>c ks. which ignited a Stanford
' ""surgeon the other end ofthe floor.
Ihe Cardinal went on a 10-2
run over the next eight minutes,
turning a 12-10 deficit into a wide
open 29-IS lead. Ihe Ducks made
two field goals in the closing min
' lites of the half to narrow Stan
ford's lead to eight .is the teams
• headed into the locker room.
In the second half, both teams
returned to the slow-paced oflen
• sive tempos that had plagued the
'-.opening minutes, and the squads
fell prey to sloppy shooting.
Throughout most of the half, the
Cardinal's lead fluctuated slightly,
but whenever the Ducks got close.
St. Clair and junior Lindsev Ya
masaki hit big 3-pointers to put the
game out of reach.
With three minutes remaining.
Oregon's Alvssa Edwards hit a 3 to
'' put Oregon within one. However,
St. Clair wasn't quite ready to stop
her heroics quite yet. ()n the next
- trip down the floor, she hit a 3-
pointer to put Stanford up by four
and send the crowd to its feet.

Enghusen grabbed a big re
bound on the other end. and ju
nior Fnjoli I/.idor took the ball into
the lane, making a quit k two.
After another stop by the ('.ardi
n.il. St. ( lair drained another shot
from beyond the arch, putting the
(.ardinal up In nine and the game
permanenth out of reach foi the
Ducks. While ()regon struggled to
foul in the closing 1:30, Stanford
consistently made free throws to
seal the win.
1 he game could be significant
as the re-emergence of St. Clair,
lite junior led the l'ac-10 in 3-
point shooting percentage last
\ear, but she lias struggled to gen
erate consistent offense this year,
especially on the Cardinal's most
recent road trip down to Los An
geles. Her four 3-pointers and 11
points give Stanford some added
offensive confidence.
In addition to the play of St.
Clair, I/idor continues to step up
for the Cardinal. After a strong
performance against Washington
State, she has worked her wav into
the starting lineup and continues
to improve. Not onlv did she 11 it a
critical lav-up in the closing
minute, she also showed character
grabbing an offensive board and
going 4-for-4 front the free throw
line as the dock wound down.
"Fuji is poised and doing a real
ly good job tor us." YanDerveer

said. "She is realK doing a good job
for lis, and helping Nicole out a lot."
I lie Stanford women return to
action tonunorow against Oregon
State, as the Cardinal looks for its
seventh straight Pac-10 win.
