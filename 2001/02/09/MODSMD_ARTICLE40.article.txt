# 'Street Forum' gives students and homeless a poetic voice
## 
### CHRISTY MACHIDA 
How many publications offer a
glimpse at an often buried and ignored
side of life? Street Foi inn, published f<»i
the first time last quarter, does just that.
Both students and homeless people ran
s|>eak out through poeti v, prose and in
terviews mi Stanford's newest quartcrl\
public ati<>n.
I Ins student-run publication sttives
to "offei a forum for the homeless coin
inunit\ to have theit views, voices and
opinions heard," according to senioi
Ann ( lien, a inembet of the Street
Forum stall.
"| We want to] in< lease awareness of a
pressing |)o\eit\ situation and issues
sin li .is income disparity, lac k of afforel
able housing and la< k of access to sei -
vices' said senioi Patricia Soung, orga
ni/ei <>1 Stieel Forum.
Soung conceived of the idea l<>i Street
lorum while working with Night ()ut
reacli. .111 on-campus 01 gani/ation that
donates materials and provides support
loi the homeless in I'alo Alto, \ltei wit
nessing the frustrations of othei Night
Outreach volunteers who felt that Ba\
\rea residents were making iiiun
tbrmed judgments and decisions con
cerning the homeless community,
Soung felt that there needed to be .111
outlet of expression about poverty
issues.
I he media did not seem to be doing
.111 adequate |<>b c»l hi inging sue h issues
i«> light," Soung said.
l ogcihei with communication gracl
uate student Dorcas (llieng, who was a

previous Night Outreach president,
Soung approached the ASSI for fund
ing for Street Forum.
Flie si.iff hopes the publication will
become respec ted and reach everyone,
according to Soung. It accepts submis
sions relating to povcrt\ and honieless
ncss. which are judged b\ page editors,
but the niajorit\ of its articles are b\ re
cruited writers.
"[We want to] aim for the c redibilit\
that publications ol this kind sometimes
do not ac liieve in their obvious partialis
01 radical perspectives 011 homelessness
and poverty." Soung said. "It's a
newsletter, so it's not like the Mind's
F.ves 01 a publication where von get sub
missions and vim pic k. We generally re
c 1 mt people tow rite stories about specif
ic issues."
I he name "Street Forum" was delib
erated c hoscn tobeonh ambiguousU as
sociated with povertN and honielessnes
because Soung said that many potential
readers are tin tied off b\ these issues.
"Sometimes people assume that a
public ation on homelessness and pover
t\ will turn out to be one big guilt trip for
those with more resources or are consid
ered more 'pi i\ ilcged'," Soung stated.
Street Forum, published each quar
tet . has .1 special sec 11011 that < lianges its
foe us even issue. Submissions can be
about this loc us 01 011 general topics re
lated to povert\ and homelessness. 1 lie
next issue w ill be published on Marc h 5
and w ill loc us 011 health 111 the homeless
community.

Itrandon Weiss had the opportunity to
inten iew .1 homeless man, which he said
was a rewarding experience.
"1 decided to write foi Street Forum
because it gave me a cliance to. . . hear a
lite story full of both tips and downs,"
Weiss said. "It's rare that vou get an op
portunity to see the personal and
liumau side of an issue which is so often
oiil\ learned about through statistics.
Alreadv. this new publication has
reached main community members, ft
was distributed at no ( barge to commu
nis shelters, < hurt lies, students and the
homeless communitx in Palo Alto. A
homeless man gave freshman Kddie Lee
an issue while Lee was working with
Night ( hitreat h. Right awav. he noticed
how "professional" it was.
"It realh impressed me that there are
students who are dedicated to writing
about homeless issues and interviewing
homeless people," Lee s.iid.
Chen said she hopes that Street
Forum will address issues that haven't
been covered in existing publications.
"We hope to serve as a forum for voic
es which otherwise are not or are rarelv
heard," ('.lien said.
Not onl\ does it eiu oin age the home
less (i>lllllll init\ to speak out, but H also
presents valuable knowledge on issues
relating to the realit\ of the streets. Ac
cording to Weiss, it speaks a powerful
message on human compassion.
"It puts human fates to those issues
and attempts to conve\ the fat t that real
people are living in the conditions which
the numbers onl\ begin to describe."
Weiss said.
