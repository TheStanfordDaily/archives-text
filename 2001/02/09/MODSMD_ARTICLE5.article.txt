A split lacult\ Senate approved
three graduate | x>lic ies vesterdav,
among tlieni the eontroversial re
vised Residency Policy for(iradu
ate Students.
" I lie new policy proposes that
graduate resident \ he defined
solelv l>\ units completed," states .1
memorandum from History Pro
fessor Steven Zipperstein, the
chair of the ( onunittee on (iradu
ate Studies.
I he former system required

istration status. This st.itus re
quires that students pa\ onl\ .1
minimal fee to continue enroll
ment. as opposed to full tuition.
I lie new polic\ allows students to
stop paving tuition .is soon as the\
have completed their unit require
ments.
Senate members objected that
the new residenc\ polic\ raises the
number of units required to re
< eivea masters 112 rom a minimum of
units to a minimum of 1"> units.
"This change from 'M\ to l.">
units is not so well thought out. It
impacts some programs drastic al
ly," said Professor of Kconomics

Roger Noll.
However, there are ways de
partments can help students with
this < hange.
"Students can apply masters
thesis units to the 45 required
units. Virtually all students are al
ready at 45 units for the masters
degree," I'niversitv Registrar
Roger Printup said.
I Ins policy will he effective for
graduate students entering in the
fall of 2001. Beginning next vear.
current graduate students who
would benefit from this polit v may
elect to adhere to it instead of the
former 10.5 quarters policy.
1 he Policy on Minimum

Progress Requirements for (Grad
uate Students, also presented bv
/ipperstein, determines "mini
mum progress requirements on
both ,i quantitative and qualitative
basis."
"Stanford has never actually
stated that, in addition to fulfilling
unit requirements, there are also
official grade requirements. We're
out of kilter with other universi
ties," /.ipperstein continued.
I uder the new program, grad
uate students must maintain a H.O
grade point average overall in
courses applicable to the degree.
