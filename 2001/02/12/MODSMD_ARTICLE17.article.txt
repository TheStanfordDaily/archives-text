Stanford students could claim never to have

like some imitation police blotter from a local

classmate or a Ii lend.
We mav take them lor granted, but Stan
lord's I loiior C.o(lc and lundamcntal Standard
are relativeh uni(|iie in American academia.
I he I niversitv's lac nit\ and administration in
vest a great deal ol trust in their students to
abide b\ these basic print iples ol academic hon
est v and behavioral decencv without oppressive
supervision.
Such 1111 si is alwavs Iragile. 1 his sort ol
contract, realb .1 collective relationship,
toultl be broken time and time again In a lew

individuals. I herefbre, we, as students, owe
it to our educators, and especially to our
selves, to act accordingly, ensuring we main
tain tliis contract.
I lie weekh pul)lication of the Judicial Allairs
column will help sustain and solidify the I niver
sitv-student relationship. In keeping with the
I niversitv's general pattern ol treating students
as responsible adults in most aspects of college
life, it is onlv fair that students he made keenly
aware of the potential consequences associated
with their actions.
We hope that, as a result of this public infor
mation, violations of Stanford's (ore guidelines
will decrease when mote students recognize
ih.it disciplinary action does occur. Most impor
tantly we hope the column will help transform
the I lonot ('.ode and Fundamental Standard
from impotent buzz words to vital, substantive
standards in both the minds and the lives of
Stanford students.
