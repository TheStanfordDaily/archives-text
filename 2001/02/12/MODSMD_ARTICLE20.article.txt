CORN Al.l .IS, ()re. — Beating
.1 team as deep and talented .is
Stanford requires the perfect
game. and.for about HO minutes
on Saturday, Oregon State was
pulling it off in impressive fashion.
But,' as soon as the
started raining down from Tevo

Beavers' faint hopes of a virion
vanished, and the Cardinal ran
awa\ with an 82-OS victorx that was
much closer than it looked.
Ip until the 1 1:42 mark of the
second half, the Beaxets (S-1 a, 2-9

After seeing even conceivable
tvpe of shot go in.the Beavers fi
nallv hit a cold streak |ust as the
Cardinal began to heat up. After
four consecutive 3-pointers, one
from Mike McDonald, two from
Johnson and another from Jacob

game was, for all intents and pur

" I hex played great." said Stan

Oregon State made even shot,

though it took until well into the
game to show.
Kven aftei their late-game cold
spell, the Beavers still finished the
game with a solid 52.1 field goal
percentage, marking the third

"They were making shots time

frustrated us a little bit." said lot

"It's just unacceptable to pla\
defense like that."
I he defense max not have been
up to usual Stanford standards,
but making a welcome return to
the offensive end was the H-point
shot, something that might have
