awa\ with an 82-OS victorx that was
much closer than it looked.

second half, the Beaxets (S-1 a, 2-9

the 3-point arc, trailing the (Cardi

After seeing even conceivable
tvpe of shot go in.the Beavers fi
nallv hit a cold streak |ust as the
Cardinal began to heat up. After
four consecutive 3-pointers, one
from Mike McDonald, two from
Johnson and another from Jacob
sen, the margin was 74-58 and the
game was, for all intents and pur
pc >ses, over.
" I hex played great." said Stan

fense I would have liked, but, bov,
Oregon State made even shot,
hvervbodx seems to be gixing us
their best shot."

Kven aftei their late-game cold

percentage, marking the third
time in the last four games the (lat -
