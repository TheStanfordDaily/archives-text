## 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Head coach Mark Marquess fell the
downpour Friday night, but it wasn't that
of rain.
Instead, it was the cold surge of w.iter
from a I latorade bucket, thrown on him in
celebration of his I,oooth career victory, as
Stanford beat Florida State 0-2.
In his 25th vear at the helm of the (Car
dinal squad, Marquess became just the
23rd coach in the history of Division I
baseball to accomplish the feat of winning
1,000 games.
Anwinglv, all of Marquess's wins

have come .it Stanford, .i phenomenon
becoming rare as main
coaches move to other st hools to pursue
better opportunities.
When asked whether he could n<> fin
another 1,000 wins. Marquess's response
was playful.
"Why not?" he asked, adding jokingb
th.it he wouldn't be able to do so if Ins
players kept pouring su< h cold water on
him.
"That [water] was freezing cold!" ex
claimed Marquess, who captured Ins first
victory on Feb. 4, 1077.
His overall attitude remained business
like in the aftermath, though, demonstrat

ing .i work ethi< that has helped the (..u
-dinal remain successful throughout ilic
ycai s.
"It's nice |to get the I,oooth win out of
the wavj," Marquess said. "I'm proud of
the fact of [getting] 1,000 wins, and it will
mean more to me in the future. But, in our
season, it doesn't mattet that much, and
now we've got more work to do,"
Appropriately, the win came on open

Di.imond, a reality made possible In the
