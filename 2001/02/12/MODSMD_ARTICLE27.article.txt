# Women's golf travels to TRW Challenge
## 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Lach year when the Stanford
women's golf team competes in
the I'RW Regional Challenge in
Southern California, Larrv and
Katie (>ra\ are there even step of
the way.
As perennial hosts, the Cravs
meet the team at the airport, take
e\er\one out to dinner and follow
the players around the 6,219-
\ artl. par-71 I'alos Verdes (iolf
Course for .ill three davs of the
tournament.
Sadly, though, there's a big
mmiething missing this vear.
In fact, it's someone.
Katie Cray passed awav earlier
this vear. She lost an 11-month
battle with skin cancer and wasn't
there to greet the five-member
M|uad when it departed the plane
.ti Los Angeles Intelnational Air
port Saturday night.
But Larry Cray was.
"Katie bad told Larrv that she

wanted him to bust us anvwav,"
said senior Stephanie Keever.
"She )ust didn't want him to stop
the tradition."
So. the tradition lives on ibis
week .is the No. 5 (Cardinal fat es 11
other top-20 teams in its first e\ent
of the spring season.
Having dropped from third in
Coltweek's preseason poll, the
(Cardinal is theonh team in the top
five that did not win a tournament
this tall.
"I think (not having won] has
pumped us all up. and 1 think the
idea th.it we haven't won will
push us a little mote this week,"
said Keever, who ranks I Ith indi
vidually according to the
Coltweek Sagarin ratings.
I he Cardinal might need that
extra push, considering a couple
of mediocre performances against
top-rated teams this fall. It placed
third to l\i ific 10 Conference ri
vals Arizona and Southern ( alitoi -
ilia at us own tournament in ()(to
iler, and then placed seventh in

the C 101l World ln\ national against
eight other top-10 teams in its final
event of the season.
Senior Hilary Homcver be
lieves tlu- team must stav competi
tive and "put it self m a position to
win."
1 loinever speaks from personal
experience, because she recently
won her first amateur title in two
and-a-half years. Her win at the
South Atlantic Ladies \mateiu last
month triggered a new interest in
the game.
"I feel like 1 can win again,
which is exciting and refreshing,
and it might be getting to the point
where this team needs that,"
Iloinevet said. "II we could win a
tournament, that would reall\
spark our confidence for later this
spring."
Keever would also like to start
off with a bang this week, noting
the importance ol making a lot of
birdies and not putting up the
high numbers that stalled the ( ar
dinal's momentum earliet this

year.
Keever and Homever will be
joined this week In sophomore
Kim Rowton and freshmen An
gela Rlio and Kim Kowabunp.it.
Rlio, who ranks 34th nationally,
was a consistent contributor to the
team in the fall, while Kowabunpat
w ill be pla\ ing a team event for the
first time.
I he squad won't forget one of
its long-time hosts along the wa\
either. I his week's task, though,
will be arduous, but certainh in
comparable to the taxing and
detrimental assignment of battling
a fatal disease.
But Lain (ira\ will still lie there
tins week, serving as a constant re
niincler of his wife.
"It is a mot nation for me to do
something for | Katie] out there on
the course." Keevei said. " lo not
give in when I'm down oi il 1 in in
trouble.".
Keever. and the team, will be
following the philosophx of Katie
Cray.


Senior Stephanie Keever prepares to swing in the Peg Barnard California
Collegiate Tournament last season. Keever and the golf team head down
to Palos Verdes this weekend, hoping to tally their first season tournament
victory.
