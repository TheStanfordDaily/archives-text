Baseball stadium's atmosphere
is 'amiable, exciting'
111 1 espouse to .1 lettel I wrote last 111011 ill
about Sunken Diamond seating resetva
tiotis. I would like to thank cvervone who
helped oigani/e the Sianloitl baseball
games ibis wcekentl. as well as the plavcrs
thf nisflves. I would also like to thank a sea
son in ket holilet who. altfi reading in\ lei
til to ilu- editor, sent 111 c tickets 101 the
games he was unable to attend.
I was extrcnicl\ impressed with the new
stadium and delighted that the amiable, cx
(iiing atmosphere surrounding Stanton I
baseball was not lost with the new sf.its and
pi it is Bet ause the wcekfiid was somewhat
cold anil r.iinv. main of the lust scats in the
liousf rem.lined vacant all weekend, and I
was able to sit front and 1 cntci with tin gen
fl al admission titket. I hail a wonderful
wcekentl listening tomusii between innings,
getting a poster signed In plavei sand eating
sunflower seeds under an umbrella as I
wan lied nn taxorite baseball team sweep the
three-game set ies against MOl it la State-.
I he new seats .11 e ver\ comfortable, and
ilu new walkw.ns help I.ms avoid stepping
on those seated to 1 loss the stadiuni. I ap
prei late-el the absence ol seating regulation.
Stanford talis are IricndK and willing to
move should season in ket holders airive.
\lthough 11 will be disappointing when the
tit ket holders ol "ni\ seats" stake their 1 laim
during a crowded game, I thoroughlv en
jovecl ni\ fii st games since the stadium ren
in.itions. I encourage evenone to ex peri
t lit t Stanford baseball, even it it means los
ing tin favorite seat.
