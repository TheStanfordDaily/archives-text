# First women cross Antarctic
## 
### 
(AP) — Picking their wa\
across ic\ crevasses and strug
gling through deep snow, adven
turers Ann Bancroft and l.i\ \i -
nesen have become the first
women to cross the Antarctic
land mass on skis.
Bancroft and Arnesen made
histon on Sunday when tlie\
pulled their sleds onto the Ross
h e Shelf, 90 d.t\s and 1,800
miles after thev set out.
"It was something to step on
the shell, Bancroft said in a
satellite phone interview vester
dav. "I've been trving to do this
for 1 1 years. Now if we can |iist
finish it off."
Bant i oil .iiul Arnesen must
now cover nearly 500 miles in
time to rende/vous with a pit kiip
vessel l)\ Feb. 22. I he\ hope to
use parasails to drag iheii hea\ \
sleds across the Ross let' Shelf, a
mosth flat slab of floating ice big
ger than I rani e.
Bancroft, 15, of Stantlia,
Minn., is the first woman to cross
the ice to both the North and
South poles. Arnesen, 17, of
()s|o, Norway, became the liist
woman to ski solo to the South
Pole in 1994.

Both explorers art* former
schoolteachers. Workers at the
expedition's Minneapolis office
said schoolchildren from five
continents are following the trip
on the Internet and using it to
study geograpln. science, histo
ry, phvsical education and other
subjects.
"It's just been the two of us
doing this trip, in a phvsical
sense, hut we've had no main
people pulling for us in so main
ways. Bancroft said. "It's really
a remarkable experience to ful
fill vour dream and have so
main people come with vou in a
wav."
I lie journcN began on Nov.
I.'i. 1 he women have battled in
jury. broken sleds and ripped
s.nls. altitude fatigue and subze
ro temperatures. I he most
ground the\ covered in a single
dav was 77 miles.
"I think we're feeling 91 days
ol wear and tear." Bancroft said
as the women prepared .1 dinner
of dried cod, potatoes and veg
etables. "We're tired and a little
thinner than we started."
On Sundav, 1 he women
pulled their 240-pound sleds

for 11101 e t ban nine lioui s
down (lie final 12 miles of the
Sliat kleton Cilacier, named
for the explorer whose disas
trous expedition in 1915 111-
spired Bancroft and Arncsen
to become polar atlventurei s.
I liev had to use ( rampons —
metal spikt-s attached to then
boots — at times instead of skis
to make it through ire that
ripped holes in Arnesen's sled.
Now the\ nuisi reach M< Mur
do Station before then pickup
vessel has to leave the Ross Sea or
risk being fro/en in.
Bancroft and Arncsen made
onlv 13 1 2 miles vesterda\ while
pulling their lieaw sleds on a
windless dav. Ihe lack of wind
turns up the pressure on the two
women.
"We onlv have nine davs to
make another 500 miles. I here's
just 110 wav to do that pulling.
Bancroft said.
II Bancroft and Arncsen ski to
within 100 miles of the ship, a he
licopter on board will trv to get
them. Otherwise, a compan\ on
the other side of the continent
will tlv an airplane oxer the ice to
rescue them.


Relatives of the crewmen and students of the Japanese fishing vessel Ehime Maru, which collided
with a U.S. submarine last Friday, arrive at the USS Coast Guard station at Sand Island, Hawaii,
on Sunday fora briefing on the continuing search and recovery operations.
