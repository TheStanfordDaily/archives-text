"A lot o! times at this time of year, bet anse people
are haying colds, the\ tlon't donate blood, said Rita
Keefe, a registered nurse in t barge ol the blood drive
on campus. "You can't donate when you have an in
fection. Also, people put oil surgeries until aftei the
holidays."
Another reason for the shortage is the large num
ber ot hospitals that ret five blood from the Blood
('.enter.
In addition to the Stanford Hospital and ('.linics,
the Blootl ('.enter is the priinan blood supplier for
three other hospitals — the I.ut ile Pat kard (children's
I lospital on the Stanford ( ampus, I I (.amino I fospi
tal in Mountain View and the ()'(ionnot I lospital in
San Jose. Ii is also the secondan suppliei to the vet
eran's hospitals in Palo Alto and Mcnlo Pai k.
Patients with certain rare diseases also take a toll on
the Blootl (Center, \\ Inch is the case tins yeai Si\ Stan
ford I lospital patients are suflci ing from I hroinbot
it Thrombocytopenic Pinpura, also known as I I P.
lhe disease requires plasm.l replacement therapy,
meaning that all of the patient's plasma must be re
moved and replaced with new plasma.
"We're talking do/ens and dozens of plasma units
daily," said C.aryn Huberinan, a staff member in the
media relations office of the Blootl ( .enter. "It's a lot
tor us even when we have one patient with I TP. It is
unusual to have six patients at once, especially be
cause FTP is a rare disease.
According to Keefe, the shortage should not last
much longer because people are recovering from
their colds, finishing their surgeries and donating
blood again.
To end the blood shot tage as soon as possible, the
Blood Center is working to encourage people to do
nate blood. I lie Blood ('.enter's donor base in< ludes

In addition, the blood ('.enter
has a program known as the I our

donors to give blood at least tour
