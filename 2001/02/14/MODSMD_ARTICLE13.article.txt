1952
On Feb. I I. 1952. fheDaib ran a whimsical arti
cle about l.u iill\ applying to be hashers at I niversi
ty Living ('»roups.
"Think of the professor who teaches your 9
o'clock. In liis gra\ suit. Yen dignified. Ever think
how he'd look in a hasher's white coat — waiting on
a table full of girls?
"Someone on Drives Committee obviously did,
because three living groups w ill have faculty hashers
at one meal next week.
"Some of the lacultx members involved wrote ap
plications lor their jobs . . .
" '1 am a teacher of Business Law. 1 sure would
like to hash where there is lots of girls. 1 figure when
they're eating, then ain't talking and they ain't knit
ting. and. Lord knows, I've had enough of both in
m\ classes,'(wrote Prof. Carl Running].'"
Bottom line: Not quite Faculty Night, is it?
