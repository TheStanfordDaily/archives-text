In his talk. FlorCruz discussed
how rapid economic growth in

to con front major politic, tl and so

"Few societies in historv have
seen such dramatic change .is

C hina has in last 2. r > vears, Its

FlorC.ru/ mentioned tnanv
problems facing China -is it con
tinues to grow, including massive
unemplovment, bankrupt state
industries, the spreading AIDS
epidemic and increasing environ
mental degradation.
However, according to Flor-
Cru/, Ihe real time bomb in

socialist ideologv weakens with
China s economic reforms. Chi
nese- c iti/ens lack spiritual and ide
ologic al values to provide them
