### NAEL FAKHRY 
An unusualK high nmnhcr ot'patients over
whelmed Stanford 1 lospital on Tluirsdav. forc
ing the hospital to resort to "diversion," in
which arriving ambulances are sent to other
area li< >spitals Ik*c auseof a temporarx hu k of re
sources to treat patients.
Di Robert Morris, chief of emergence med
ic me at Stanford I lospital. said there were "two
periods at which the hospital, including the op
erating room and emergeiu v room, was totalh
full. All in all. the diversion lasted about nine
and-a-half hours." between noon and 5 p.m.
.ind (') p.m. and 10:1 7 p.m.

I he hospital was filled to the point that no
beds were available for incoming patients. Al
though incoming ambulances were turned
awav, patients who arrived under theii own
power were admitted.
\orris said that the most serious .ts|><-« t of
the diversion occurred when "we diverted trau
ma patients tor about two bout s. I hat's some
thing we realK don't like doing. We alwa\s tr\
to keep trauma open because those are some of
our most serious patients.
1 he hospital has one of the lowest divei sion
rates in the count\. meaning it rarelv turns pa
tients awa\.and usualh foronh .i short period.
I vpicallv. it enters diversion in the c.isc of a
multiple-car accident in which several patients
are brought in for treatment simultaneously.
W hen ambulances are diverted, patients are
sent to other hospitals in the area. On I hurs
cla\, two appendicitis patients alreach in the
hospital were transferred to Kl ('.amino Hospi

tal iii Mountain View.
I lowever, trauma patients who are diverted
from Stanford I iospital tan onlv to San |ose
Hospital and \ alle\ Medical Center, both ol
which are in southern Santa ( '.lat a County, be
cause no other hospitals in the count\ contain
trauma centers.
Stanford's C.hief Medical Officer Dr. Peter
Cregorv said in the Palo Alto Daily News ih.it
the hospital has been operating exceptional!)
c lost- to capacity in the past few weeks and that
ibis situation was rare.
\orris attributed the overflow to the tact
that, "there was an extrenieh unusual influx of
reallv sic k patients."
I It- explained that older people are most sus
ceptihle to sickness at this time of the year, as
the\ easily develop respirator) ailments when
ihe\ contract viruses. The result is that the\ "get
pushed over t lie edge" anil end up needing
medical attention.
" 1 here is also a critical nursing shortage, so
it is very difliinit to get the necessan number ot
nurses to staff beds," he said.
I bis nursing problem is a chronic one that
exists nationwide, but it is especially acute at
Stanford. Morris attributed the problem at
Stanford to the high cost of living in the area,
which in.ikes nursing an unattractive employ
ment option because of the relatively low pa\.
1 "he Palo Alto Daily News reported vester
da\ that Santa ('lat a Countv will probably send
the hospital a warning letter after Thursday's
»losing. Suzy Baltich of the county's emergent \
medical services department saitl in the Daily
News that Stanford violated county rules de
signed to prevent long closures.
In order to avoid having to resort to diver
sion again, the hospital is currently in "Prevent
Mode," in which doctors and the hospital ad
ministration ai e tr\ing to avoid a recurrence of
last week's problems. For instance, the hospital
administration is working to add HO new beds
over the next lew weeks in .1 new intensive care
unit and .111 intermediate care unit.
1 he hospital is also beginning a major re
cruiting effort to hire more nurses so that a sim
ilar influx of patients in the future will not have
the same overwhelming effect.

Stanford Hospital closed its emergency room to arriving ambulances for over nine hours last Thursday.
The closing occurred because all beds in the hospital were filled with patients.
