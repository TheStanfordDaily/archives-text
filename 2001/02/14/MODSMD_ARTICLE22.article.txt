## Next 'Survivor' should be sporty 
### 
I 'm proud to admit th.it I am
one of three Americans —
excluding those currently
incarcerated 01 .it sail on
the high seas — who hasn't
jumped onto the "Survivor"
bandwagon.
Yep. it's just me, Sister I heresa
Mullen of Boston's North F.nd
and Karl, .1 funnel from western
Nebraska, who thinks the whole
thing is one big government con
spiracy to steal his sorghum nop

and porkbellies.
But mv mind
isn't made up
for sure vet.
I here may be a
"Survivor" fan
deep clown in
side me some
where.
Had the ad
vertisements for

the new "Outback" edition —
which were almost as übiquitous
at the Super Bowl ;is questions
about Rav Lewis and the Cobalt
Lounge — hinted that one of the
participants would be eaten b\ a
croc odile during the course of the
season, I would have been tuned
in evei v I hursda\ night.
It's not the concept that bores
me — it's how thev are doing it.
What would really catch m\ atten
tion would be "Survivor III: The
Sports Kdition." Now there's an
idea.
I welvc contestants would be
whisked away to a small island in
the Seychelles in the Indian
Ocean, known onlv as a mating
ground tor migratory birds and
the site of a Sports Illustrated
Swimsuit Issue photo shoot.
Oiven onlv minimal food and
water — and contract perks — the
contestants would face off in a se
ries of skill competitions, and each
week a leopard-print, toga-clad
I)ick Vitale would host a ceremo
ny in which one contestant would
be voted off the island.
But the critical thing would be
who would take part in this
sport drama extravaganza so 1
came up with a short list of poten
tial candidates. I brow this motley
crew together, and watch the
sparks fly.

I lere the\ are (in no particular
order):
WW I \1 I. head honcho
Yince McMahon: Ihe abilit\ to
"kill" a wild boar with a metal fold
ing ( hair would certainh tome in
handv. If he brings the \KK
cheerleaders, that would |iist be
extra bonus points.
Besides, we need a solid figure
in the media communit\ to lend
credibilitv to our new show.
PGA Iburgolfei rigei Woods:
No collection of sports figures
would be complete without the
"golden one."
Plus, K1 l'igre's got Stanford
connections, and 1 know he could
crack a few coconuts with that
nifty boutu ing-off-the-face-of
the-sand-wedge trie k.
Baltimore Ravens' defensive
tackle Tony Siragusa: "T he
(loose." who anchored the Supei
Bowl champion Ravens' D-line,
would certainh lose points fot his
prodigious appetite and non-stop
banter, but his interpretive dance
version of the creation myth
would be great for around-the
c ampfire entertainment.
Los Angeles Laker Mark
Madsen: You gotta love the
heart and intensity the "Mad
Dog" brings to the table. And if
there's anyone who's going to
get along with everyone, "Hog"
is your guy.
Tennis star Anna kourniko
va: Hey, this is network televi
sion, and you're going to need a
sex-svmbol to boost the ratings.
Plus, she's good foi at least one
catfight or temper tantrum per
episode.
Boston Red Sox outfielder (..n l
Everett: No drama is complete
without a schizophrenic, and the
mercurial outfielder certainly fits
the bill.
Mike I vson: You cannot have
.in island adventure without the
ever-present fear of cannibalism.
Iron Mike once threatened to
eat Andrew (iolota's children.
And we all know about HoK field
and the ear.
