## The 						Answer girl Chemistry clears hangover haze 
### STEPHANIE CHIANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Q: Oh nuni, lluit keggei at I lulu Dell l/ist
weekend really messed me nf>. I don't even re
membei what I drank. <md now I have the most
obscene headache! What causes these hangovers
anyway, and is there anything I can do about
them ?
A: first, the bad news: There is no way
to completeh get rid of a hangover. Now,
the good news: Bv knowing the physio
logical ( ausesot hangovers and taking just
a tim hit of responsibility when drinking,
yon can greatly reduce a hangover's
severity.
But let\ back up and consider what
happens when vou get drunk (besides
feeling like vou're the best dancer on the
floor).' 111 is process is. whether you like it
o! not, basically a euphemism for the poi
soning of vour bodv.
Alcohol (ethanol, for the chemists)
rapidlv entet s the blotulstream after inges
tion and affects the frontal lobe of the
brain. This leads to a loosening of inhibi
tions and a reduction in judgment control.
Here's the kicker: Hangovers, in all of
their glorious s\ mptoms, are the bod\'s at
tempts to process and remove alcohol
from vour s\ stem.
Here's how the bodv does it: The liver
and kidneys go into overdrive to remove
the alcohol vou drank because vour bodv
considers ethanol to be toxic. 1 lie process
of removing the alcohol requires a lot of
water because the toxins have to be dis
solved in order to be successfulh filtered
In the livei and tunneled to the kidnevs,
where the alcohol eventually ends up as
urine. 1 that s win drinking and toilets go
so well together.

It vour bod\ doesn't have a large avail
able supply of water in the stomach or in
ternal organs, it's sucked from othei
places. These places include the lvmph
nodes, blood and the brain. I he loss of
water leads to those excruciating
headac lies. So, through this prcxessing of
alcohol, the both and brain become deh\ -
drated. And that is the No. I reason fin a
h mgover.
A second and much less-recogni/ed
cause of hangovers is congeners. 11 use
are toxic chemicals that emerge from the
alcohol fermentation process, and some
actualh resemble dioxin.
These cogeners are what give drinks
their unique flavors, smells and colors.
And the\ 're most prevalent in darker,
often tastier, liquors.
The third reason tot vour morning
after malaise is vour sy stem's exc ess of ac -
etaldehvde. When the liver processes al
cohol, it primarily uses two en/.vmes.
I he first is called alcohol dehydroge
nase, which converts the alcohol into
toxic acetaldehvde (i.e., formaldehvde,
the stuff thev preserve dead specimens
in). A second en/vme. aldehvde dehy
drogenase converts acetaldehvde into
acetate, which is much less harmful.
However, if ADH works fastei tlian
ALDH. acetaldehvde builds up. and you
can become sic k. I nfortunatelv, how
well these en/vmes cooperate is deter
mined bv individual biolog\ and cannot
be improved.
Now that we uncle! stand the ph\ siolog
ical basis foi hangovers, let's see what we
can do to prevent them, l ocountei dehv
dration, drink water alternateh between
alcoholic drinks. As Ralph ('.astro, stall
specialist at ('.owell's Alcohol and Othei
I )rug Abuse Prevention program, einpha

si/es, a "one-tor-one philosophy is good.
Drink one shot ot one beer, then drink
one glass ot w atet. 1 his not onl\ helps pre
\eut dehydration, it .ilso helps to reduce
the numbei ot .ilcoholic beverages con
sumed. This, ot course, is also a fac tor in
determining severitx ot hangovers: Ihe
more vou drink, the worse vour symptoms
are the next morning.
Another wa\ toc utdownon headaches
is to drink lighter colored liquors, w hic h
have fewct congenei s. (.m and vodka are
good examples. Scotch, rum and brandy ,
howexei. have lots ot congeners — six
times the amount present in gin. And
don't reach tor the bourbon: It has eight
times more congeners than gin and a
whopping times more than vodka!
Also, ii\ not to drink the cheap stuff.
1 he more expensive, higher quality
liquors ai e purei than tlieii cheaper coun
terparts and. therefore, aren't as likely to
cause a hangovei. While you're at it. don't
mix different types <>1 ale oliol. If \on down
a varict\ ol t\pes, voui bod\ has to identi
fy and deal with different kinds of con
geners individually. I Ins, of course, puts
extra strain on \our body.
And don't evet take aspii in. T\lenol or
ibuproten while drinking. They irritate
the gastrointestinal tract and work the
li\er liardei. straining ateas which are al
read\ in overdrive.
Also, tr\ to avoid carbonation, which
(.in be found in wine c oolei s, bee ause e ar
honation increases the rate of alcohol ab
sorption. And watch out foi sweet drinks
because the metabolism ol sugan com
pounels uses up vitamin B. \ loss of \ita
inin B saps energ\ and leads to that grog
g\ letharg\ the morning after.


Lastly, despite the appeal of drinking dining
stressful times, don't reach lor the bottle! You're
much more likch to get .1 hangover, and a much
more intense lungovet .it (hat, because your body's
not mi top limn when stressed. And th.it means that
it < ant get 1 id of those toxins .is c|iiie kl\ or as well.
()kav, but \oii s.iv that vou alrcadv have a hang
over. Now uhat?
For starters, von should drink lots of fluids and
get plcntx of rest. You should also try to get some
lood 111 von pro\ided vou aren't still vomiting —
because voui both s resources have been used up in
alcohol processing. |list don't sit there and not eat
anwhing at all; \ou won't feel better because vour
bo<l\ hasn't been given the fuel to feel better.
A cold washclc >th 011 the fate, which constricts the cn
lai ged blood vessels, could help rediK e vour hcachtchc.
And take vitamin Bl 01 B complex vitamins. Bl.or
thiamine, is important because it's a necessary com
ponent 111 alcohol metabolism. Ifthiamitie is not read
ily available during alcohol metabolism, it's taken
from your brain. Asi arc it\ of thiamine makes it hard
er to process alcohol and c an even lead to eventual al
< ohol-related brain damage. So take your vitamins!
A final note: Manv mvthical hangover cures,
such as black coffee, reallv don't do much. In fact,
black coffee does additional damage because coffee
— like alcohol — is a diuretic, which causes even
more dehydration.
()r vou could |iist not drink 111 the first place ...
