After two elet ti k it\ bla< kouts in the
past three weeks, main Stanford stu
dents are prol)ahl\ wondering how
Stanford's power svstein works, espe

looming in the bat kground. For almost

matul or less.
Recently, the Stan
ford administration
has asked Stanford
communitx members
to conserve power so
that the on-c atnpus
(lardinal ('.ogeneration
Plant, which provides
power to Stanford, will
be able to sell more
power to the rest of the
state.
Robert Reid, man
ager of Stanford's En
ergy Management
(•roup, declined to
comment on how the
school's power system
works, citing lack of

permission from his superior, Assis
tant Vice Provost for Facilities ( litis
Christofferson. In fact, Christoffer
son dei lined to allow I he Dailv to 111-
terview anv of Stanford's employees
who work on the power system, sav
ing, "We're about to go into third
partv negotiations, and I'm not inter
ested in any more publicity for Cardi
nal Cogen. I'm not going to discuss it
further."
Cardinal Cogen operations
Cardinal Cogen is a wholly owned
subsidiary of GK Power Systems, whose
parent company is General Electric.
Commissioned in 1987, Cardinal
Cogen has a 15-year energy contract to
provide power to Stanford that ends in
2002. The contract provides for ener
gy-pricing based on how much North

em California's primary electric itv ser
vice provider, Pacific Gas and Electric ,
charges to its ( nstomers and is linked to
state-mandated energy prices. Accord
ing to |nil Sontton, operations manager
at (Cardinal ( ogen, about (>0 percent of
the power produced In the plant is sold
to Stanford, and the other 10 percent
goes to P(«&E.
About nine veai s ago, Stanford sued
Cardinal Cogen oyer how the plant
calculated its energy rates for Stan-

ford. I he lawsuit was settled in arbi
tration, according to Stanford General
Counsel Debra Zumwalt, who was
working in Stanford's lcg.il office at
the time. Annually, Cardinal Cogen
generates $25 million in sales; overall,
GE Power Systems earned $14.5 bil
lion in 2000.
Asked if the current energy crisis
will affect upcoming negotiations for
the renewal of Stanford's powei con
tract with Cardinal Cogen, Soutton
said that it might, but that it would
largely depend on how the state gov
ernment will be regulating energy
prices in the near future.
Soutton added that even after dereg
ulation of California's power system,
Stanford's energy rates have only in
creased nine percent over the last font
years. That's because the state govern

merit has placed price controls on the
prices P( K can impose on consiimei s
for electrii itv.
P(?&K was lotted to sell most of its
own power plants three vears ago be
(anse of deregulation, so it relies on in
dependent energv providers to get its
power.
As a result of skyrocketing prices
within the last vear on electricitx that
out-of-state providers sell to P( >X.-l and
int t eased elect l icit\ demand in ( alifot -
nia, PG&K has been

driven to the brink of
bankruptcy.
Amid accusations
that independent ener
gv providers are goug
ing PG&K by incleas
ing maintenance on
plants so that tliev will
produce less power
and, hence, t ommand
higher prices, Soutton
said th.it (Cardinal
Cogen is in fact doing
the opposite. "With the
current situation in the
state, we're making
everv effort to keep the
plant running; we're
pushing off mainte
nance, " he said.

Soutton added. "From our perspec
tive, we have the same conti at i pricing
set l>\ regulated pi it es as the 1 est of the
state, so we tould ueithei conspire nor
benefit from [increased maintenance].'
Sutton said that, even though Cardi
nal ('.ogen sells onl\ about 40 pertent ot
its out put power daih to IH the loss
of'C.ogen saps even more power from
I'C&K's reserves, because the I niversi
t\ uses I'C&K supplies when Cardinal
('.ogen is down.
