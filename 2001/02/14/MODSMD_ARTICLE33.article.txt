# New legal challenge threatens use of automated software bots
## 
### 
WASH INC lON (AT) — Software robots
that automate repetitive tasks on the In
ternet are redefining the meaning of life
online — and forcing courts to decide
wliether ti espassing laws appl\.
I wo targets of the so-called bots, eßa\
Inc. and Kegister.com Inc., contend the
bots are unwanted intruders 011 private
propertx.
I lie companies have won prelitninarv
injunctions, though the hot owners have
appealed.
Proponents sav bots use public Web
sites no differentl\ from hiimans; bots
aie just quicker. 111 their view, it slionld
make 110 difference whether a human
\isits .1 Web site or delegates a robot to
do so.
I lie < 01111 challenges are among the
latest attempts to make laws designed
foi plnsical propertx appl\ to virtual
terrain.
"We're still grappling with the ques
tion ol what's the right analogx and how
fai \ou can stretch that analogy until it
breaks down, said Wallet Kffross, a law
professor at American I niversity in
Washington.
( emits are being asked to cl.uifv what
the Internet Irnlx is: \ public library
w here an\ bc)d\ c .111 c 0111 c 111 and brow se? A
prixate store where owners can restrict
w lioni the\ let in?
l lia\ takes the latter view, arguing that
all nseis are bound In terms of service
agreements posted at the site, even if tlie\
nc\ei read snc li notices. 1 he rules ban
bots without spec ial permission.
Bidder s l-'.dge had deployed robots to
eßa\ ami oilier sites to help Internet users
view all anc lion listings .it once.
I Ba\ complains that it cannot be sure
thai Biddei's l.clge would give customers
complete, accurate and tiineb listings.
This. eßa\ spokesman l\e\ 111 I'ursglove
said, the robots stiain eßa\'s resources
and could cause servers to slow down for
human c ustoniei s.
Hide lei s I-.dge I in . argues that if eßa\
wants to re strict visitors — human or 111 -
c bine — it ought to require passwords.
In the Kegister.com case, Verio Inc . clc

ployed robots to glean ownership and
contact information about various do
main names from Register's "V\ hois
databases.
"Hotting out Whois is inherently bad,"
said Jack Lew. Register's general counsel.
"We're not saving that some people can
come in and some people can't. We're sav
ing that evervbod\ lias to plav b\ a certain
set of rules."
As an Internet registration company.
Register is required to provide public ac
cess to such information, but the company
savs it lias the right to place restrictions on
how the infoi mation is obtained and used.
Register s.i\s Verio violated Register's
usage terms not onlv bv using robots, but
also bv using the dat.i foi marketing. I lie
compam sued under a sei ies of claims, in
cluding trespassing.
Verio refused comment on robots and
the trespass theory, saving n was waiting
for court guidance.
It's not the first use of trespass to stop
Internet at tivities.
Compuserve Inc., now part of AOL
I line Warner. succcssfull\ used the prin
ciple in 1 9 ( .)7 to stop one compam from
sending jllll k e-mail. Other service
provide) s follow e<l suit.
Mole recently, Ik ketmaster Corp.
cited trespassing, among other claims, to
l)l<» k 1 ickets.com from "deep-linking —
rcai lung one <>l Iii ketmaslei 's inside Web
pages without going through the "front
page" area that contains advertising.
A judge refused to grant l ie ketmaster a
preliminary injunction. Although the
t oui t considered the computer "a piece of
tangible personal property." it did not
find enough harm.
Dan Huik, a I nivcrsitv of Minnesota
law professor w ho co-w 1 ote a brief against
cßa\. worries that more and more compa
nies will use trespassing arguments to trv
to control their sites. .1 trend that would
challenge the Net's tone ept as an open ( ol
lection of networks.
"I he new claim of trespass is so
broad." Bulk said. "As soon as vou use
in\ server, and 1 don't like it. 1 tell the
court it's trespass."
