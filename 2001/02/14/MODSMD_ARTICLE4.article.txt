stanii.il than those of other ( 11' dorms, in

According to Mont ova, the scope ot the
renovations means that Branner, unlike
other dorms.» an not be properly renovat
ed over a summer.
Director of Student Housing Services

st! lit lion .is a model, the I niversitv decid
ed to close Brannei foi nine months.
" I he advantage of»losing Brainier for
the nine-month pel iod means that we can
have a completed Brainier without incon
venient iug residents." Montova said. "We
were aware of the impact the l ovon reno

lution that won't have a similar impact."
I lie I niversitv had previously
planned to renovate Brannci over three
summers, starting this vear, hut decided
that plan was less workable.
