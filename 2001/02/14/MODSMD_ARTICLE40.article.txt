A fluorescence micropscope captures epithelial cells preparing for cell division. A structual element of the cell s cytoskeleton,
actin, is stained in red. Microtubules, which are involved in later stages of replication, are shown in green. Cellular DNA, in
the form of chromatin, is stained with blue. The yellow cells are actively dividing (Image courtesy of Steve Rogers)
