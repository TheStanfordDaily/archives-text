What do such nanie-bi and companies as \lllcri
caC)nline,Sun Mi« rosvstemsand Ama/on.coin have
in common?
Ihese companies, like- main 01 bet successful
businesses, originated, in part, through the work of
Kleiner. IVrkins, < auticld .V Bvcrs, one of the most
prominent venturec.ipit.il funis in Silicon Yallcv.
and the world.
kleinei Perkins (..infield X- Bvcrs is .u the fore
front of the high-tec li revolution, providing the cap
ital, contacts and management expertise to trans
form ideas into reality. Although venture capital
serves to finance new companies, the lolks at this
firm pride themselves on hands-on involvement
with the management and operations of then port
folio companies.
" flic people here at Kleiner are more than just
operating people, thc\ are business-builders," said
partner Brook Byers. "It's been that wa\ since Ku
gene Kleinei and loin Perkins started the- firm 2<S
years ago."
Byers has been involved in venture capital since
1972. 1 Miring this time, he has fen used nine h of his
attention on the life sc ienc es and biotec Imologx. I le
formed the first lile science practice group 111 the
venture c apital profession. I his helped his firm be
come a premier venture firm in the medical, health
care and biotechnology lielcls. and a leader in Inter
net applications for these sec tors.
I he fii 111 has close ties to Stanford: the I nivcrsi
tv is a shareholder of the firm's major investment
fund. Bvcrs himself has an MBA from Stanford, and
his brother is Professor loin Bvers of the Manage
ment Science X: Kngineering Department.
"Mvclaim to fame is that 1.1111 I om Bvers'sbroth

ei." Brock said.
I he emphasis 011 business-building is shared bv
everyone at the firm, both new and old. ()nc of the
newest members of the fii 111 is Steve Andei son (M BA
'99) — "a superstar." according to Bvcrs.
Anclci son joined the lii 111 direct!) after graduat
ing from Stanford's (•raduate School of Business.

He was not seriously pursuing a career in venture
< apital, but tins only made him more attractive to the
firm.
Anderson attended a dinner hosted by the (iSB
Venture ( apital Club that featured .in associate
partner from the firm. Everyone at the table intro
duced themselves as people interested in working in
venture capital, but Anderson said lie wanted to
manage a great company.
I his unique response led the company represen

tilti\c* to invite Anderson to work with the linn on
some ol their projects. As he worked with the linn,
lie found that he could learn a lot from them.
At Kleiner. IVrkins, (..infield &Bvers, Anderson
has the opportunity to work alongside some ol the
most accomplished business leaders in the Yallev,
including \ intxl khosla, who was the founding
C.KOoKSun Microsystems, and Ka\ l.ane, who was
president and ('.()() ol ()racle.
Anderson docs not plan to sia\ at the linn forev
er, hut he sees venture capital as a stepping-stone tor
developing*! skill-set necessary lot becoming a great
CEO.
Anderson studied phvsit s anil business .is an un
dergraduate at the I nivcrsit\ ol Washington, lie
worked in pnxluct marketing at eßay, enterprise
sales at Digital Equipment Corporation and held
several general management positions within retail
operations at Starbuck s.
Since graduating Irotn the I nivcrsity ol Wash
ington, Anderson has alwavs chosen experience
over salary in the jobs he has considered. I lie reason
behind this is his locus on the long-term.
"1 have alwavs tried not to hxus on what's right
ahead but to keep my eve on the long game and do
what I am happy with," Anderson said.
According to Anderson, his drive to succeed
in business is due in large part to a desire to give
back to the community. At Starbuck s, he saw
how the CEO could positively inlluence the lives
of the 10.000 employees bv providing generous
benefit packages while, .it the same time, build
ing a very successful business. Anderson wants to
have the same impact on those working with him
in the future.
He plans to start a company of his own in a few
years. Until then, he continues to work long hours .it
the firm helping build successful companies.
