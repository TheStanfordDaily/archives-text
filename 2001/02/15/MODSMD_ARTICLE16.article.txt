tings are not especially conducive to forming rela
tionships based on more than course material 01
that can endure after the class has ended. In fact, un
dergraduates from main different majors across
c ampus regularly complain of a lack of access to fac
ulty and awai eness of their fellow students, especial
ly in the larger disciplines like economics, biology
and engineering.
Although a large research university like Stanford
offei s a seemingly infinite array of opportunities foi
the development of academic and social relation
ships. it also lias the tendency to breed isolation or
"clique-islmess" among the members of its commu
nity. Foi undergraduates, meeting professors in

volves a substantial amount of initiative and follow
through in the generally awkward situation of Office
hours. It would Ih.' much easier tor students and their
teac hers to engage each other in a natural, de-pres
surized environment when the encounter doesn't
feel as much like an interview*.
While student-faculty interaction should play an
integi al pai t in the college experience (for those who
desire it), perhaps more important for students and
protessoi s is maintaining a healtln social life. There
seems to be a tradition .it Stanford of separating the
ac adcmic from the social \%llen it comes todav-to-day
living.
We have our friends in the dorms and our col
leagues in the c lassroom. Indeed, how often do our
i lassniatcs become our h lends or even social acquain
tanc esr 1 low often do we stick to the same small social
group wishing that yve met new people or had a wider
c in le of friends outside out living arrangements?
Academic departments signify pre-established
communities within the larger I 'niversitv that could

serve as another social outlet without much effort.
I ntra-departmental bonding activities possess im
mense potential to foster social relationships by en
abling people to build upon similar interests and ex
periences within the department or major, or even to
discover common ground in a relaxed group setting.
Such events allow students, professors and adminis
trators to interact with each other as people. The
University should provide support, be it ideological
or financial, to all departments for exactlv these tvpes
of gatherings.
Communitv-building within academic depart
ments would not take much monev or effort. Aquar
terh luncheon or afternoon inception would be a
good start, or perhaps regular student-faculty dis
cussion forums on current issues related to the disci
pline. Relevant movie screenings are also a possibili
ty. It reallv doesn't matter, as long as department
members come together and feel like they belong to
a human communis rather than an organizational
bureaucracy.

It iiment si.ill — who .ire usually anonymous, from

the student point of view — perform the bureau
cratic functions essential to both groups.
Indeed, the vast majority of student-faculty and
even student-student interaction within the < lass
room occurs in a rather detached and ritualized
manner. 1 )ist ussions revolve around abstract. or at
least impel sonal. topics. These foi mal academic set
tings are not especially conducive to forming rela
tionships based on more than course material 01
that can endure after the class has ended. In fact, un
dergraduates from main different majors across
c ampus regularly complain of a lack of access to fac
ulty and awai eness of their fellow students, especial
ly in the larger disciplines like economics, biology
and engineering.
Although a large research university like Stanford
offei s a seemingly infinite array of opportunities foi
the development of academic and social relation
ships. it also lias the tendency to breed isolation or
"clique-islmess" among the members of its commu
nity. Foi undergraduates, meeting professors in

volves a substantial amount of initiative and follow
through in the generally awkward situation of Office
hours. It would Ih.' much easier tor students and their
teac hers to engage each other in a natural, de-pres
surized environment when the encounter doesn't
feel as much like an interview*.
While student-faculty interaction should play an
integi al pai t in the college experience (for those who
desire it), perhaps more important for students and
protessoi s is maintaining a healtln social life. There
seems to be a tradition .it Stanford of separating the
ac adcmic from the social \%llen it comes todav-to-day
living.
We have our friends in the dorms and our col
leagues in the c lassroom. Indeed, how often do our
i lassniatcs become our h lends or even social acquain
tanc esr 1 low often do we stick to the same small social
group wishing that yve met new people or had a wider
c in le of friends outside out living arrangements?
Academic departments signify pre-established
communities within the larger I 'niversitv that could

serve as another social outlet without much effort.
I ntra-departmental bonding activities possess im
mense potential to foster social relationships by en
abling people to build upon similar interests and ex
periences within the department or major, or even to
discover common ground in a relaxed group setting.
Such events allow students, professors and adminis
trators to interact with each other as people. The
University should provide support, be it ideological
or financial, to all departments for exactlv these tvpes
of gatherings.
Communitv-building within academic depart
ments would not take much monev or effort. Aquar
terh luncheon or afternoon inception would be a
good start, or perhaps regular student-faculty dis
cussion forums on current issues related to the disci
pline. Relevant movie screenings are also a possibili
ty. It reallv doesn't matter, as long as department
members come together and feel like they belong to
a human communis rather than an organizational
bureaucracy.
