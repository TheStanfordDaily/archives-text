How should this problem be atl
cliessetl? 1 propose that the ethnic theme
dorms on campus be changed to aca
dcmicallx oriented "F.thnic Studies
Dorms" in the tradition of Public Policv.
l ast Asian Studies and the now-discon
tinued Aniei it an Studies houses. Ux ths

Also, freslunen should either not be
raneloinh assigned to these dorms, or
should be allowed to opt out of such as
signment when tilling out housing prefer
ence tot ins before coming to Stanford.
Naturallv. students should be allowed full
expectation of pi ix.it \ in doing this. I his
will ensure that fewer students who are
uncomfortable with an ethnic theme will
be assigned to sue h dorms where neither
the student nor the dorm xvill benefit from
lott eel intcrat lion.
Perhaps bx making these c hanges, we

Mental illness a 'legitimate
health problem'
Pctci St.ut s tininfbrmetl response to
kathciinc l.einons's article ("Mental ill
ness not unusual," Feb. (i) on mental ill
ness among Stanford students showed the
kl lic I ol self-absorption and ignorance typ
ical among those who Itaxe never experi
enced mental illness and are resistant to
acknowledge il as a "legitimate" health
pre ihleni.
I lis ac e usation that those ol us who live
with mental illness are not properlv taking
e arc of out selves was written just ctxptic al
lx enough to avoid coining tight out and
saving, "It's all in your head. (iet over it."
I nhealthx lifestyles are not a satisfacto
tx explanation for mental illness. For over
a vcar, I li.tve xvatt hed "mentally healthy"
students at Stanford deny themselves
sleep, balanced nutrition, exercise and re
laxation. (Not to mention the use and

ul hi scot (I mi ik als in various forms.) But
self abuse foi the sake <»1 acceptance lo
medical school, lavs si liool 01 an i-bank
ing job is supposedh pait of (lie 1101 mal
life of "tlie l\ pu al Stanfi >rd student."
As someone who lias toped w nli clin
ical depression tor as long as I've been
alive, 1 would venture 10 guess thai in\
lifestvle lias been more healtln ilian that
of most Stanford students.
I smiph cannot afford to not eat well,
get enough sleep or exercise. And not
being able to keep pace with "the typical
Stanford student, ho is expec ted to be
able to sta\ active with ac ademic sand ex
trac in ik ulars at tlie expense of hisoi her
own health and still do exceedingh well,
has onlv served as additional pressure.
1 began drug therap\ foi m\ depres
sion last spring aftei one of my most se
vere encounters with the illness. As a
human ecologN major, I'etei Stan ought
to be aware of the connection between
sunlight and seratonin. I .u h winter, when
the (lavs are shorter and the weather
cloudier, I have struggled to do basic
things most people take tor granted: < heck
e-mail, go to c lass, go to meals, sometimes
even shower. Despite ni\ mood, despite
ni\ lack of energv, 1 pushed
m\self through high school and still man
aged to get here.
I his. 1 am ecstatic to report, is the first
winter during which I am not miserable.
I'm taking an intense ac adcmic load, oi ga
ni/ing political coalitions on campus and
helping plan lake Back the Night.
1 am i hallengiug in\ self to keep up wit li
niv painting projects oil the side and
preparing tor the second printing of ni\
book. Do 1 sound like 1 am plagued b\ ir
rational expectations of others? It has
nothing to do with that. M\ expectations
are for me. W'hic h is .ilso ti ue foi the stu
dents with mental illness I know here at
Stanford.
But perhaps there is something to
Peter Stair's "Why?" Wh\ did I feel so
mm li pressure to c ontorm to an image of
"the happv student"? Win did 1 feel like I
was falling off some blessed "track" when I
realized I could not agree with the "Amer
ican Dream" of becoming ru her and rich
er and not caring at whose expense?
The greatest poets, philosophers, writ
ers and others with non-standard wavs of
thinking have almost all suffered from
some kind of neurosis or depression. Yet
Peter Stair asserts that we are the ones not
willing to "look within. I low much intro
spection does it take to cruise through
Stanford unconsciously, doing the work,
getting the As, all on the "typical Stanford
student" road to unlimited success and
fortune?
Likewise, hamsters, running nowhere
on their little wheels, are pretty content as

fat as we can tell. Since he is so convinced
that "mental illness" is a made-up excuse,
nix advice it> Peter Stair is not to step off
the wheel.

De Klerk 'a liar'
I his letter is in response to Christen
Voting's Jan. 81 letter. "De Klerk gave .1
mo\ ing and inspired speech on the strug
gles of Ins nation to end the apartheid
regime. When he began his political ca
reer. apartheid and the asstxiated dis
crimination were meant as a 'temporary
solution' that would guide South Africa
into several looseh united nation-states,
each with a different ethnic identity."
Wake up! Apartheid existed even before
de Klerk was born. Would the Norwe
gians have presented de Klerk with the
Nobel Peace Pri/e if they shared his per
spective on apartheid? Or were you mis
understood?
Mavbe the problem is th.it von speak
from an uninformed platform. Sure, it's
important to voice your opinion on this
page, but make sure you don't curtail
other's rights to do so by passing on mis
leading information. Then would von call
it a "temporary solution" to keep the per
spectives simple?
let's face it: Besides being a "decorat
ed"' politician, the man's a liar. And if his
speech was not "moving" and "good,"
what would he be doing here (for the sec
ond time)?
In the protest request letter that Chris
ten Young was replying to (which, by the
wa\, was signed by nine different student
organizations), the organizations stated.
"We want to be clear that we are not chal
lenging de Klerk's freedom of speech.

However, allowing him to leave Stanford
unchallenged would be an insult to the
masses of people that struggled to bring
apartheid to an end."
I, too, was present at de Klerk's speech
.ind stood up after his speech and turned
mv back. 1 was not, as de Klerk cleverly
jabbed and Young correctly quoted, fac
ing "the future with [my] backsides, while
the majority [looked] the future in the
eye." De Klerk is not the future, pure and
simple. The future is in South Africa striv
ing to keep the peace.
Not only is de Klerk still being accused
bv the Truths and Reconciliation Com
mission (a group that plays a "major role"
in South Africa's future) of misrepresenta
tions and lies, he's also being assailed bv
those within his partv as not having repre
sented himself truthfullv. De Klerk is here
to push his public image and his book.
The minority of people that stood and
protested after de Klerk's speech on Jan.
29 represented a broad span of the Stan
ford community. Christen Young decides
to rely solely on the prepared speech of a
seasoned politician, much maligned bv
controversies, l.on the other hand, choose
the informed route. 1 will, as Chris Mal
oney stated in his Jan. 25. guest column,
read his autobiography as well as locate
other sources of information to help me
gain a better understanding of the issues
that South Africa battled with then and is
battling now.
And. please do not patronize me bv ask
ing me to understand that, "While most of
us disagree with the basis of this plan
[apartheid], we must understand that, in
1970, it was a political ideal," and that I
should applaud de Klerk because he "dis
cussed [his ideals], with a touching display
of passion."
