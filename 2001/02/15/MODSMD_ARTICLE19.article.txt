Because Stanford maintains a higlih
( onipetilivc athletic program as well as a
ligoious academic one, the Athletic s I )e
-partnu'nt and the Admissions Office
must work togethei to find candidates
who are outstanding scholars and out
standing athletes lor the I niversitv's
teams.
Stanford's athlete population is small
ei lit.in that ol most o| its athletic inni
pctitors. and there are main more hur
dles to successful icc niitment here than
elsewhere. While athletics and admis
sions have .i long histon ol cooperation,
the Admissions ()tln e has tlu- final sav.
Potential athletes must meet ninii

miini iecjiiirenients loi consideration,
which are a '1.0 (il'A and 1 ()<)(> S \ I score.
\i Stanford, though, the average SA I
score tends to he considerabh higher
than 1000.
Also, phvsical education grades are
not factored into the (■ l*A calculation,
and oil en a grade ol D oi lowet in the ju
nioi \e.n can severch narrow the odds ol
admission.
Statistics are not the <>nl\ considera
tion, however. A student s attitude and
charactci are also important factors.
I licse qualities are reflec ted in the sin
dent's short answers and peisonal state
ii lent, teac I hi and coach evaluations and
othei exlracurricul.il commitments.

that Stanford does not make ext eptions."

Men's swimming to.n h Skip Kenne\
also said the charisma <112 the \.ll sit\ ath

significant part of Stanhrd's appeal.
" flic kev to this place are the

When potential recruits come
here, the thing thc\ notice most is
how different the Stanford stu

schools."
