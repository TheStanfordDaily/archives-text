I hat common message is one of

community.
Originally, AASA treated the talent
shoyy to make itst'll more at < essible to the
.Stanford student body. Noyv, the talent
show contributes not only to the cohesive
ncss of tlit' Asian-American community,
but also to the cultural advancement of
Stanford as a whole, said AASA chair An
dre yv |hmi. a senior.

"I've heard it's a great time for the
Asian-American community and the rest
of the Stanford community to come to
gether to see student talent showcased."
Ku said.
Patio agreed on the talent show's
broad scope.
" Hie general impression at Stanford is
that 'AASA' on a flier implies something
strictly Asian American and something
very cliquey." he said. "This isn't a show
about just Asians or just minorities. I Ins is
a show to enterlain people, and that's why
tlicv should come."

hi addition to providing entertain
ment, organizers hope that the show will
work to dispel stereotypy about Vsian
Americans.
"The reason whv AASX puts on this
talent show is because all n>o often Asian
Americans are onl\ seen astlie model ini
noritv and stereotyped at being book
worms who spend most of their time
studying," |hun explained.
"People should come to this talent
show because it's eye-opening, and it real

I alentetl," the AASA talent show will con
sist of five (hosen ads battling tot the
"Best of Show" award. For $5 .i lit kct, or
ganizers promise the audience an inter
esting medley of skills.
" I his show will be the only opportuni
ty to see, in one sitting, flame jugglers,
urban street dancers and hip-hoppers
communing in the communication of a
tonimon message, Lee said.
I hat common message is one of

community.
Originally, AASA treated the talent
shoyy to make itst'll more at < essible to the
.Stanford student body. Noyv, the talent
show contributes not only to the cohesive
ncss of tlit' Asian-American community,
but also to the cultural advancement of
Stanford as a whole, said AASA chair An
dre yv |hmi. a senior.
Kveti though slit- has never seen the
\ASA talent show, freshman ( hristinc Kn
plans on attending.
"I've heard it's a great time for the
Asian-American community and the rest
of the Stanford community to come to
gether to see student talent showcased."
Ku said.
Patio agreed on the talent show's
broad scope.
" Hie general impression at Stanford is
that 'AASA' on a flier implies something
strictly Asian American and something
very cliquey." he said. "This isn't a show
about just Asians or just minorities. I Ins is
a show to enterlain people, and that's why
tlicv should come."

hi addition to providing entertain
ment, organizers hope that the show will
work to dispel stereotypy about Vsian
Americans.
"The reason whv AASX puts on this
talent show is because all n>o often Asian
Americans are onl\ seen astlie model ini
noritv and stereotyped at being book
worms who spend most of their time
studying," |hun explained.
"People should come to this talent
show because it's eye-opening, and it real
ly shows <i side of Asian and Pacific Is
lander Americans that no due is used to
seeing," Jhun continued.
I his year, organi/ers out more
atypical acts in order to vatt|iiish stereo
types, according to Pacio. Acts will include
vocalists, an accordion plavcj, a unicvclist,
fire jugglers, guitarists and cancers.
Lee stressed that this years talent show
will be distinguished from he previous
ones.
" 1 lie AASA Academy of tit* (lifted and
Talented 2001 will be the fir;< talent show
to showcase multiethnic performance ads

on campus. espcc lallv those that are rep
resentative ol various minorit\ groups,
such as Kvervda\ People, |amPac'd, In
()bject/ and Alliance," l.ee said.
I he A AS A talent show has grown siik e
its inception four years ago. Initially, it
was held in dining halls with walk-in ads
.ind an audieiH e ol about Hf>. When Pacio
and l.ee took over last year, the purpose
w.is honed, auditions were held and the
audience quadrupled.
Pacio and l.ee have been planning for
the AASA talent show since December
and are committed to its mission.
"1 think that AASA has a responsihilit\
to showcase \sian American talent and
the talent of the communities of color,"
Pacio said. " I his is the perfect venue for
it."
"It is artistic alb contemporary and po
litically aware, a perfect example of tal
ented iii(ll\ iduals using an art form to ad
dress various issues important to all ethnic
communities," l.ee added.
Seniot Ann I.e agreed. "You get < nl

excitement generated In last \ ear's show,

t\ to come out and support friends and to
watt It this "hip and funm show."
I'acio and I .ee will be performing, and
