Slut lent \ ideti at the start of the autumn quar
ter. even though ilicn were both studying
abroad 111 Spain and (ierinanv. respeclively.
I lie initial propositions for the project were

Ilclbrc beginning t onsti ut lion, htiwever,
SSL i tmtlut tec 1 an online survcN to pretlit 1 the
response of the student liodv .According i<>
I asche, the sui vcn received more than 1.000
replies, .intl there was an "overwheliningb
positive response." (liven the high demand.

LLO Colin Mt (iavin, theN immediateh went
to work.
Lndelman beliews that "they have tlone an
extclient job." and he has "nothing but piaise
foi then work." Although the idea of an 011-
(.11111 >1 is Nitlct) store was considered 111 the past,
Lndelman believes thai the combined "t reativ-
II \ and motivation of Last he and Ahmed are
the reasons the projet t was finalh attempted.
\s .1 result of iheii bard work, Ahmed be

lieves that tin- "process has gone quite
smoothh," as he and his partner onl\ faced
three main challenges. Ahmed and Last lie
were laced with the task of finding an ade
<|uate amount of space on campus. I hev de
(ided to solve tins problem l>\ (rcating an on
line store because it "would utili/.e 'virtu.il"
spat e." Also, hoth ol them found it tliflit nil to
"balance the tremendous task of starting .1
business (in.»short period of time) with [their]
othei commitments."
In addition, starting a video store simplv
isn't easv. but ont e thev found the appropriate
infoi ination regarding the logistit s of the busi
ness, Ahmed thinks "the whole process prct
t\ straight-forward."
Having overcome these obstacles, Last lie
believes that Stanford Student Video will not
onh "provide a service for the students that
the\ w ill enjo\ and make their lives easier." but
this venture w ill also be an "opportunity lot me
and Shad to run a great business." W itli the at
titude that the most important .is|>c< 1 of am
business is (onsunier satisfaction. SSL asks that
vou \ isil then Web site or e-mail them with an v
suggests. (omnients or questions.
As Ahmed at knowledges, " I his is Stan
ford's video store and, with evervone giving
then input, this project will be a worthwhile
student service."
