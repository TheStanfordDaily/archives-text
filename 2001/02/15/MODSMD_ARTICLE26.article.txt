## Powder heals all road trip wounds Coops survives car trouble and weather to ski perfect Tahoe 
### JEFF COOPER STAFF COLUMNIST 
Dude. Fourteen hours of
driving, three broken
chain cables, two roadside
rescues. $30 in last food and M\t\ -
seven indies of powder. Ill take
that over psvt holog\ reading an\

day.
I here is noth
ing like a fresh
powder dav in a
major ski resort,
w hie h is wh\ I set
out tor Lake
lahoe Saturdax
night in the mid
dle ol the rain.

Driving to Fa hoe without tour
wheel drive isn't a ple.tsant expe
rience in hea\ \ weather, but I had
my chains, m\ flashlight and all
my snow gear — even thing 1
thought 1 would need.
()t course, six hours later, sit
ting on the side of the toad star
ing at the broken cable on m\
snow chains, a tool kit seemed like
a pretty good idea. Live and
learn.
Shametacedlv, I flagged down
a snowplow and gave the driver
my best lost-puppv-dog look, giv
ing a silent thanks to ni\ mother
for blessing me with her baln
blue eyes. 1 he driver? in fine
heaw -machinet v-operatot fash
ion. had enough baling wire and
electrical tape to fix me up. and I
pulled into the Stanford Ski
learn drivewax minutes later.
( Thanks are due at this.point to
the men and women of the ski
team, who put up a loneh travel
er in a snowstorm. You won't see
them coveted in these pages
much (ahem, editors), but the\ re
up there week-in and week-out,
representing their school with
pride, or at least without too
much of a hangover. \lostl\.)
I he next morning, after dig
ging mv car out of the snow,
sci aping all the windows and dip
ping the loose cable off m\ chains.
I was readv to go. Nothing. 1
thought, could keep me from the
first runs of the day.
()f course, 10 miles from the
mountain, mv chains got other
ideas. Another (able had rusted
out and pulled loose. Dark forces
were death conspiring against
me.
As ItK k would have it. I broke
down across the highwax front

I lit- California State .igi Kiilitn .il
i11s| (ion (bet kpoint, .1 building
usualh .is useless .is .1 tropin case
in .1 Cal gymnasium. But 111 these
circumstances. it was a godsend.
After a squirt el-like charge across
the highwav with the offending
chain, I had the holt-cutters out
and snipping. Soon enough, 1
w as at the slopes.
What's to s.i\ ahout the skiing?
Fresh powder prett\ much can't
be heat. M\ favorite part of being
at a Squaw or .i Kii kwootl on a big
powder day is the crowd that the
da\ attrai ts. 1 he camaraderie of
ac tuallv making it onto the slopes
in a storm gives rise to a wonder
ful sense of fun all over the moun
tain. Most everyone serious
enough to come out in the middle
of a snowstorm is spectacularly
good and knows it.and that gives
rise to an infectious sense of in
vulnerability. It's hard to get hurt
in deep powdet —vou've got to
hit at lee or a hidden rot k — and
the depth of the snow slows \ou
down and keeps von 111 control.
So you see 12-vear-olds
hurtling oil elderh
women blasting out of the forest
< o\ered in snow, telemat kei s rid
ing out six-foot wide chutes. ()ne
man in a sit-down chair-ski was
blasting the bumps not f.ll from
the lodge like |onn\ Moselev all
d.u long.
Riding up the chairlift at one
point. I watt lied one skier cut
hard around a < aulion pole, make
one turn and drop off a two-stoi \ -
high rock without slowing down,
to the cheers and hoots of those
riding the lift. "Dude, that was
savage!' shouted a snowboarder
behind me. " I here go your
kneecaps, but that was savage!"
M\ next 11111, I rode up the lift
with the gu\ who'd dropped off
the rock. He was 25, from W ash
ington, and had gone to ('.olorado
for school. "Haven't had anything
like this in a while," he s.iid.
breathing hard. "Nothing like it."
File last few winteis have been
prettv mild for mam o! the major
American ski met (as, and d.iys
like Sunday are rare in an\ event
for those that (an t jet oil to I'eru
or Antarctica.
Rumors floated around the
mountain nii(l-da\ that llighwa\
<S() had been dosed down for
plowing. Most people I rode with
reacted like six-vcar-olds whose
s( 11001 has )iist bin ned down. You
feel guilt\ lor celebrating, but
right then most of us would have
staved there until the snow
mcltsed in |une.

1 .ate in the afternoon, I rode
up tlie lilt with a guv from I .owell.
Mass., about half an hour from
the town where 1 grew up. "Yes

to do, the snow lets von do — il
von want to ski hard, von (an, and
if \<>ii want to be mellow, von ean
be mellow."
For skiers and boarders raised
in New Knglantl on mountains
where using the phrase "40 iiu li

shrink, where experts skid down
glare ice and ext Linn. "Ain't New
Kngland great!" and w here, if von
don't make snow, vou don't get

snow, a big powder da\ is like
vou've died and gone to heaven.
flic ride back .it the end of the
da\ was anticlimactie. save for vet
another rusted cable living loose
from m\ chains. I his one I
hat ked ofl with a tire iron on the

the Discovers Channel. I didn't
care, though. I ( amc bat k to cam

What's to s.i\ ahout the skiing?
Fresh powder prett\ much can't

at a Squaw or .i Kii kwootl on a big
powder day is the crowd that the
da\ attrai ts. 1 he camaraderie of
ac tuallv making it onto the slopes
in a storm gives rise to a wonder
ful sense of fun all over the moun
tain. Most everyone serious
enough to come out in the middle
of a snowstorm is spectacularly
good and knows it.and that gives
rise to an infectious sense of in
vulnerability. It's hard to get hurt
in deep powdet —vou've got to
hit at lee or a hidden rot k — and
the depth of the snow slows \ou
down and keeps von 111 control.
So you see 12-vear-olds
hurtling oil elderh
women blasting out of the forest
< o\ered in snow, telemat kei s rid

man in a sit-down chair-ski was
blasting the bumps not f.ll from

d.u long.
Riding up the chairlift at one
point. I watt lied one skier cut
hard around a < aulion pole, make
one turn and drop off a two-stoi \ -
high rock without slowing down,
to the cheers and hoots of those
riding the lift. "Dude, that was
savage!' shouted a snowboarder
behind me. " I here go your
kneecaps, but that was savage!"
M\ next 11111, I rode up the lift
with the gu\ who'd dropped off
the rock. He was 25, from W ash
ington, and had gone to ('.olorado
for school. "Haven't had anything
like this in a while," he s.iid.
breathing hard. "Nothing like it."

right then most of us would have
staved there until the snow

Dude. Fourteen hours of
driving, three broken
chain cables, two roadside
rescues. $30 in last food and M\t\ -
seven indies of powder. Ill take
that over psvt holog\ reading an\

day.
I here is noth
ing like a fresh
powder dav in a
major ski resort,
w hie h is wh\ I set
out tor Lake
lahoe Saturdax
night in the mid
dle ol the rain.

Driving to Fa hoe without tour
wheel drive isn't a ple.tsant expe
rience in hea\ \ weather, but I had
my chains, m\ flashlight and all
my snow gear — even thing 1
thought 1 would need.
()t course, six hours later, sit
ting on the side of the toad star
ing at the broken cable on m\
snow chains, a tool kit seemed like
a pretty good idea. Live and
learn.
Shametacedlv, I flagged down
a snowplow and gave the driver
my best lost-puppv-dog look, giv
ing a silent thanks to ni\ mother
for blessing me with her baln
blue eyes. 1 he driver? in fine
heaw -machinet v-operatot fash
ion. had enough baling wire and
electrical tape to fix me up. and I
pulled into the Stanford Ski
learn drivewax minutes later.
( Thanks are due at this.point to
the men and women of the ski
team, who put up a loneh travel
er in a snowstorm. You won't see
them coveted in these pages
much (ahem, editors), but the\ re
up there week-in and week-out,
representing their school with
pride, or at least without too
much of a hangover. \lostl\.)
I he next morning, after dig
ging mv car out of the snow,
sci aping all the windows and dip
ping the loose cable off m\ chains.
I was readv to go. Nothing. 1
thought, could keep me from the
first runs of the day.
()f course, 10 miles from the
mountain, mv chains got other
ideas. Another (able had rusted
out and pulled loose. Dark forces
were death conspiring against
me.
As ItK k would have it. I broke
