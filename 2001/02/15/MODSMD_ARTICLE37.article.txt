Where clici you find these artists?
l itest- are people from all over the world

(li.it 1 respected or
had lie.iid about the
\i t ('.onspir.K \. It'sso
new, it's |iist like a
Hood even dav. I
have people who just
like to take pit tines of
theit friends. And
then I've got people
who've got paintings
in the ('onspirao
auction house for
$120,000. There's
this whole gamut ol
reall\ interesting
artists out there who
don't realh have a
wav to get ju'ople to
(heck out tneir stufl.
It's all about trallic,
getting people to sec
their stuff.
It's actually really
interesting that you

said that because the other day 1 was think
ing about how music generally moves, and
you have to have a community basically.
You need to have people growing around
you, supporting each other, and then you
have so much power to affect people.
I'll.il s exactb right. Ihe whole thing
about ihe art conspirac is that out e \on get
all different artists together, wmi have pho
tographers talking to film makers, and film
itiakei s talking to si 1 ecu w liters. Kverxbodx
is into it. So main people step up with a (Ill
icit 111 idea here and there. When vou put il

together, it's a juggernaut.
1 think we're definitely in need of that
right now.
We're going to have (his thing called \n
Alliance, where people from all ovei the
country can post on i Ins virtual notehoard. 'I
live in this dtv 1 pla\ this. I like (his kind of
music, is there anyone else out there who's
into that kind of lliing?'
What is your book about?
It's ( ailed "The Little Monkex (Ihroni
t ies 1 he hook is a (olle( (ion ol short stories.
It's written in children's hook st\le, but the
content is a little more dat kei and in depth.
It's got a humorous slant to it. Illustrated In
the inightx ( In is I hompson.
I low did you come across Chris Thompson?
I've been friends with liini lorever. We
lived togethei in Seattle, in tins famous house
called the ellow I louse, w here a million and
one bands started, including Simn\ Da\.
If you could describe your musical pro
ject as a band in one word, what would it l>e?
Saucy. Wait no, bacon-flavored. Is that two
words? \ tie l>etween sauc\ and bacon-llavored.
What's tlie significance of the title, "The
Rising Tide," and how does the album flesh
out that theme?
I don't know, actually. I think it meant

something dillerent when (he record first
came out, and now it's just kind of a dual
edged theme of hopeful on one side and
dat k on the other side. We're working on out
new record now. so it's kind of hard for me to
shift gears and think about the past. It's .1
thing that's been said. I know it's weird, be
cause for some people it's still probabh a new
record. It actualh just got released in japan a
week ago.
Where do you envision the next album
going? How do you think your sound will
evolve?
I he songs are going to be dillerent than
we've evei done before. Fver) record we
make we tend to tend to do things a little hit
dillerentK. It invariabK upsets some people
and makes other people tiapp\. I lie songs
are sounding prett\ melodic, not realh like
txpical song structures. We're kind of push
ing the envelope.
Do you know when and where you're
going to record yet?
We should stait recording In April. I'd
like to n \ rec<irding in the south of France 01
mavbe Iceland.
Are you planning on touring after that?
Any plans for Europe?
We w ant our lust tour in promotion of the
record to be a Furopean tour. We've said so
main times we're going to go on tour there
.ind we've had to i ancel even time.
Will you remain a three-piece?
Yeah, I'm sure we'll do the writing .is a
three-piece (Ihances are we're going to have
some interesting artists play with us in the
studio this time around.
Are you having guest artists?
Yeah, we've got Fminem scheduled. No,
we're not really one lor guests artists so
much. II we get somebod\ to play, it will just
be a musician wt* respect. I don't think we're
going to do anything flashy.
Which musicians do you respect that are
around currently?
You know , 1 realh like Fminem. Actualh
I do. I hat's not just a joke. I realh like Ra
diohead. I lave von heard Kid A?
Would you ever tour with them?
(>h, that would be amazing. I don't know
it tlie\ would have us. I hev're amazing. I
don't know il thev would like Suuu\ I)a\ Real
Fstate.
Sunny Day Real Estate's record has been
largely underground, yet you have released
some videos on MTV. What sort of success
are you striving for, and what are your ulti
mate goals?
I ven year we sell a few more records and
gain more ground, l'he next record will
probabh be a bigger venture for us than the
last one. I like the fact that we can release a
1 ecot d, and no matter what we do, we \\ ill sell
I()().()()() no matter what we do. I hat's realh
hard to do with a band that doesn't have
videos. I lie videos we did were back in the
Diaiy" days. We didn't do a video for"The
Rising Fide," but we're going to do a video
fbi this album.
What do you think about promotion?
II you want to be serious and sell records.
\on have to tr\ to promote your band. It's just
whether or not you play the game. Whether
or not you're a whore. If you've just honestl>
got a record and vou want people to hear it.
that s one thing. We've been around fora
long time. We're not trying to con anyone.

l itest- are people from all over the world

(li.it 1 respected or

\i t ('.onspir.K \. It'sso
new, it's |iist like a
Hood even dav. I
have people who just
like to take pit tines of
theit friends. And
then I've got people
who've got paintings
in the ('onspirao
auction house for
$120,000. There's
this whole gamut ol
reall\ interesting
artists out there who
don't realh have a
wav to get ju'ople to
(heck out tneir stufl.
It's all about trallic,
getting people to sec
their stuff.
It's actually really
interesting that you

said that because the other day 1 was think
ing about how music generally moves, and
you have to have a community basically.
You need to have people growing around
you, supporting each other, and then you
have so much power to affect people.
I'll.il s exactb right. Ihe whole thing
about ihe art conspirac is that out e \on get
all different artists together, wmi have pho
tographers talking to film makers, and film
itiakei s talking to si 1 ecu w liters. Kverxbodx
is into it. So main people step up with a (Ill
icit 111 idea here and there. When vou put il

together, it's a juggernaut.
1 think we're definitely in need of that
right now.
We're going to have (his thing called \n
Alliance, where people from all ovei the
country can post on i Ins virtual notehoard. 'I
live in this dtv 1 pla\ this. I like (his kind of
music, is there anyone else out there who's
into that kind of lliing?'
What is your book about?
It's ( ailed "The Little Monkex (Ihroni
t ies 1 he hook is a (olle( (ion ol short stories.
It's written in children's hook st\le, but the
content is a little more dat kei and in depth.
It's got a humorous slant to it. Illustrated In
the inightx ( In is I hompson.
I low did you come across Chris Thompson?
I've been friends with liini lorever. We
lived togethei in Seattle, in tins famous house
called the ellow I louse, w here a million and
one bands started, including Simn\ Da\.
If you could describe your musical pro
ject as a band in one word, what would it l>e?
Saucy. Wait no, bacon-flavored. Is that two
words? \ tie l>etween sauc\ and bacon-llavored.
What's tlie significance of the title, "The
Rising Tide," and how does the album flesh
out that theme?
I don't know, actually. I think it meant

something dillerent when (he record first
came out, and now it's just kind of a dual
edged theme of hopeful on one side and
dat k on the other side. We're working on out
new record now. so it's kind of hard for me to
shift gears and think about the past. It's .1
thing that's been said. I know it's weird, be
cause for some people it's still probabh a new
record. It actualh just got released in japan a
week ago.
Where do you envision the next album
going? How do you think your sound will
evolve?
I he songs are going to be dillerent than
we've evei done before. Fver) record we
make we tend to tend to do things a little hit
dillerentK. It invariabK upsets some people
and makes other people tiapp\. I lie songs
are sounding prett\ melodic, not realh like
txpical song structures. We're kind of push
ing the envelope.
Do you know when and where you're
going to record yet?
We should stait recording In April. I'd
like to n \ rec<irding in the south of France 01
mavbe Iceland.
Are you planning on touring after that?
Any plans for Europe?
We w ant our lust tour in promotion of the
record to be a Furopean tour. We've said so
main times we're going to go on tour there
.ind we've had to i ancel even time.
Will you remain a three-piece?
Yeah, I'm sure we'll do the writing .is a
three-piece (Ihances are we're going to have
some interesting artists play with us in the
studio this time around.
Are you having guest artists?
Yeah, we've got Fminem scheduled. No,
we're not really one lor guests artists so
much. II we get somebod\ to play, it will just
be a musician wt* respect. I don't think we're
going to do anything flashy.
Which musicians do you respect that are
around currently?
You know , 1 realh like Fminem. Actualh
I do. I hat's not just a joke. I realh like Ra
diohead. I lave von heard Kid A?
Would you ever tour with them?
(>h, that would be amazing. I don't know
it tlie\ would have us. I hev're amazing. I
don't know il thev would like Suuu\ I)a\ Real
Fstate.
Sunny Day Real Estate's record has been
largely underground, yet you have released
some videos on MTV. What sort of success
are you striving for, and what are your ulti
mate goals?
I ven year we sell a few more records and
gain more ground, l'he next record will
probabh be a bigger venture for us than the
last one. I like the fact that we can release a
1 ecot d, and no matter what we do, we \\ ill sell
I()().()()() no matter what we do. I hat's realh
hard to do with a band that doesn't have
videos. I lie videos we did were back in the
Diaiy" days. We didn't do a video for"The
Rising Fide," but we're going to do a video
fbi this album.
What do you think about promotion?
II you want to be serious and sell records.
\on have to tr\ to promote your band. It's just
whether or not you play the game. Whether
or not you're a whore. If you've just honestl>
got a record and vou want people to hear it.
that s one thing. We've been around fora
long time. We're not trying to con anyone.
