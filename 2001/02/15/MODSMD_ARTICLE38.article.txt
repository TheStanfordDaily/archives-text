# Dar Williams tackles life's nuts 'n' bolts
## The
						folk goddess, her laundry and the Intermission interview 
### KATIE HILL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"I try to capture lilt* at strange angles," said folk singer
songwriter Dar Williams, a performer whose music deals
with the ins and outs of everyday lilt*, l he singer, who re
cently released her fourth solo alhum "The (ireen World"
on Razor and I ie Records, will play .1 sold-out show .it Stan
ford's kresge Auditorium on Tuesday, Keb. 20 .it 8 p.m.
With three previous albums, "The Honesty Room"
(HKW), "Mortal ('.it\" (1{)?M>) and "Knd of the Sunnner"
( IW7), as well .is fre(|uent touring, Williams has established
.1 devoted grassroots I.in base ,uul has received widespread
critical acclaim. I let Stanford show, one of only two dates on
the West (io.ist, will be her first 11 ip to the I diversity.
(lilt tenth on totn . Oar Williams sat down with Intermis
sion to talk about pla\ing i ollege venues, writing songs and
some of her favorite places.
I don't know if you know this, hut your concert at Stan
ford sold out in less than an hour!
I heard that tnv sister told me. 1 111 so thrilled!
You sometimes perform with a complete band, hut your
Stanford show is part of a solo tour. What is different about
doing a solo tour?
I like doing solo tours because it's almost like you get to
be this one woman show. You get to find yotn own pace
over the night. You know, you might look down .it .1 song
list .ind changc everything around just based on the spirit
of the evening when vou're solo, and you can do th.it with a
band, but it's ]t Ist not very nicc to the band. You (.111 be
more flexible, the show can sort of breathe more naturally
when its solo. It's not .is theatrical a setting, though, which
is .1 fun thing about having .1 band.
You only have a couple of tour dates listed on the West

Coast. What made you decide to come out here?
Pregnant sister. I'iii about to become .111 aunt again.
1 .ooking at the tour schedule. I noticed that you have
a lot of dates at colleges, and I know that you started out
at Wesleyan University. Is there anything different or
special about playing at colleges?

I love pla\ ing .11 colleges. I played .it (irinnell once, four
01 live veal s ago .it this point, and found m\ sell by the end
ol the show so excited that 1 was Hinging organic tampons
into the audience that I was just going to put out in .1 big
bowl lor the kids I was learning .ill these things about chlo
rine bleaching and dioxins.
At one school, all these kids brought in caincra, whi< li is

hilarious,

wanted to dance. Not every night is like that, but it's always
lun, and you always encountei people who arc game and
who kind ot get the jokes. I'm looking forward to it.
A lot of your songs are written in the first person. How
does your personal experience come into play in your
writing and your lyrics?
Well, you know, it's pretty far removed. I tluiik th.it it
requires that. I spent! a lot of time |iist trying to take (.11 e
ol my life in such a way that I don't piss oil the muse. I
tliink I'm all into the nuts and bolts of iu\ life. I'm making
sure that I've done this man v loads of laundry. C )n the one

walk out on the planet and pit k up on .ill the vibes and
stand in youi lile and recogni/c the powei o( youi rela
tionships and sort of tlu- existenti.il expei ience of what
like to be on a planet that has trees and < omnium* ations
svsteins, .md if'vou don't spend time wondering at all that
stuff, nothing will inspire you.
I spend a lot of time keeping my eyes open and then
surprising invself at what presents itself as a song. I sin
prise mwlf at what c hokes me up. Kven the song about
potheads m ( ollege that I wrote (laughs) mii pi ised me .it
how emotional it lelt when I kind of understood what I
was writing about. It was like time traveling me bat k to a
group of sort of stoned activists who were, (»otl love them,
taking a .stand lot important causes and realb |iist li ving
to get people to sleep with them. As long as I try to see
beat it \ in the world, beauty comes bat k to me. beauty pi e
scnts itsell to me in such a way that I want to write a song,
but I never have a clue what that's going to be. What's
going to present itself as so important that it's wot thy of a
song.
I low do you go about writing songs? Is it lyrics first,
then music, vice versa or a mix?
Usually I'll have a lot of lyrit s running through my head,
and a tncloth will present itself and I will be able to marry
the two together. There is always a stream of consciousness
running through my head, so il .1 melody pops into my
head, I usually find mvsell kind of gravitating toward one
Ivrit, tugging it down and applying it to the melody. I was
just doing that this morning.

Who have been some of your greatest musical influences?
I would s;iv ilu* lolk rockers o! the bOs and '70s, what
was railed lolk iot k at Ihe time. Whit h actually is not very
lai Irom the kind ol production that I used to do which
people tailed pop, which is interesting. I think there's
more ola put ist acoustu movement going on right now. I
111111 khi the '(.(Is it was I'.iul Simon, |oan Baez, the Byrtls,
|ud\ ( ollins and hy association .1 loi ol dillerent writers,
like I'm >1) Dylan and 1 .eonard Cohen, |om Mitt lu-ll and Cat
Stevens.
Who is no longer Cat Stevens.
Welljh.it happens. I was .11 eligion major and even w hen
I was voung, I lemenibet thinking: This gu\ realh strug
gles with l.iKll issues.' So I wasn't surprised when hehet .11 tie
.1 Muslim. Me was realh si 1 uggling with a lot ol things and I
lhinkfiomwh.it I heard had .111 incredible well anyway,
there I>l it fbi the gr.it e t»l (ioti go lin tei 111 sol the extremi

You have a background in theater, don't you?
Yes — I was .1 theater and religion major in college.
What was the favorite role that you ever played?
(Laughs). I hat's <1 li.itd (.ill because 11 's also the time in
\oiii life that \Oll play it. I think evei \ role I plaved brought
me into a community ol people that was important to me. II
we're looking at transformative experiences, then it was
probably when I was, you know, lb vears old in the t hoi us
in a summer theater production of "The Boy Iriend." I "here
was also a time when 1 w.is realh just what would prohahh
qualify .is suit idally depressed and a friend made me audi
tion lot "The Death I rap," and I played llelga l endorp,
which is Broadway's finest, vou know (l.iughs).
It wasn't something vou could dig youi teeth into, but as
a comedit role, 1 coultl dig ni\ teeth into it. I reineinbei
going into the costume room and |iist finding the most
elaborate, glamorous polyester pants I totild lind. You
know you're supposed to study your t liai .it tel . hut I de
< idetl that .ill I knew about hei was that she watt lied Mer\
Ciillen at night and slept with |ung had been analyzed
l>\ and slept with Carl |ung. Sometimes the llakiest roles
are the nit>st important times to est ape into somebody else's
identity.
A lot of your songs are very involved in a sense of place,
particularly on "Mortal City." What are some of your fa
vorite places, and are there any places you would never
live?
I have this thing that I t .ill "I.ill in love cities." whit h are,
il I lell in love with somebody, I would move there. They
.lie: Berkeley; Kdiiiborough, Scotland; Pittsburgh, I'a. and
II oilier. Alaska. And I realh like I oronto ant I Montreal and
Vancouver. I hose are first runner-up fall-in-love cities. I
think it <1 he hard to move to I.os Angeles. Although. .1 lot ol
m\ friends are doing it. so not as hard. < )thet wise, it's all an
adventure.
I really love where I live now. I live in the I ludson Valley
of New York. It's .ilmost like I'm trying to take a time ina
t bine back to where 1 grew up. Where I live now is a version
of where I grew up. It's sort ol like . . . well, the ( lintons live
111 the town where I grew up now. in Chappaqua, N.Y -So
I've moved to a town right now that's more sleepy than
(lliappaqua bet ause('.happatjtta y\.is very sleepy when I was
growing up in it.
So it's funny, lot all of the (last atles and the Appalachi
ans and the (.nil of Mexico and the Pacific ()cean and red
woods that I've seen. I kind of get pulled back into this very
lamiliar, gentle, deciduous Northeastern landscape. But I
love every plat e that I've visited. I don't think I'd be very
good in Arizona. I think I'd he worried about water use all
the time.
We are really lt>oking forward to seeing you next week
at Stanford.
Thank you.
