I he I niversitv has recenth made public de
tails surrounding the M.i\ field Site, six .n 1 es at
the intersection of F1 ('.amino Real and Page
Mill Road. I his propcrh was offered to the( n\
ma letter d.ited Oct. ."> for SI per veai for."> 1
years.
I lie land swap constitutes a tlnee-\va\ deal
111 which the Palo Alto I nified School District
will be able to convei t the 1 crinan ( onununit\
(lenter. which currenth houses the Albert 1..
S( Inilt/ |ewish C.ominunitN ('enter, back to a
third middle school. I lie Mavlield site could
then be leased to the ( onmiunitx ( entei b\ the
city.
In exchange, Stanlord would be gi\en
100.000 additional square feet of building
1 iglits m the rest.ii( li park, or the amount the
(it \ puts on the Mavfield site. I"he I niversitv
stressed that if development rights ate not
granted. Stanford will not complete the deal.

"To focus on Stanford development is to
muss the point." said l ai n 1101 ton. directoi of
(ioveinment and ( oinmunitv Relations.
"We've asked that we be able to transfer the
rights and build elsewhere in order to compen
sate us for the use of the site. II the\ don't use
the site, we won't be using the development
rights."
Norton explained that Stanford lias em
barked upon tlie land-swap plan in the()< tobei
5 letter written to the mavoi of Palo \lto.
" I Ins offer will break the dcadlot k that lias
developed in finding a solution to the difl'u ult
problem of opening a new middle school and
still retaining a communit\ center.
I he lettei also stated that the I niversit\ did
not feel that the agreement would be a burden
to Palo Alto's communis services.
Much controvei s\ has arisen com ei ning the
land-swap, especiallx in regard to the location
where Stanford plans to use these building
rights, 112 lot ton explained the land use in a letter
to Frank Ik'iiest, Palo Alto (.it\ Manager, on

Jan. 9.
"WV would distribute 100. (100 square feet as
follows: 31,000 square feet at the northeast cor
nel of California Avenue and Hanover Street
and (">9,000 square feet in the area bounded In
Porter Drive, Hillview Avenue, Foothill E\-
presswav, Arastradero Road. Deer ( reek Road
and Page Mill Road."
\i litis point, the researc li pal k is full\ leased
out. lint some siu-s with available /oning re
main. I his implies ih.it the I niversitv may not
be able to take advantage of the remaining
f>9.000 square feet of building rights for some
time. In ibis rcspet I, Stanford lias stressed that
the agreement is not being made in the I m
versitv's own interests.
"Stanford is going to lake a finaru tal loss: the
\lavlielcl site lias a fair mat kei value of Over $S0
million." s.ll< 1 I loi ton.
It should be noted that unit h open spate is
available on campus, but the I imcisit\ has
been required to preserve <i good
deal of it hv the c ity. Two such ex
amples involve the (General I se
Permit granted by Santa (Mara
County in December, and an
agreement pertaining to Coyote
Hill made in 1909. Stanford has
very willingly agreed with these
regulations.
I he Ccneral I se Permit, which
outlined rules for land use over the
next 10 vcars, established an acad
emic growth boundarv prohibiting

development of 90 percent of the
campus south of Junipero Serra
Boulevard — including the
Foothills — thus comentrating de
velopment in the core campus.
The Co vote Hill agreement pro
hibits am development of the hill,
which is situated west of Foothill
I'.xprcsswav and south of Page Mill
Road.
In an effort to clear up any con
fusion regarding future develop
ment, Stanford has vehemently
maintained that any building
rights the University may acquire
through the land swap will otik be
put to use within the confines of
the research park.
