l .et's st.irt with tlie basics, \esop Rock in .1 1M -year-old i apper out of New York (lit\. Ills appearance h.is been likened
to Hi end all Fra/.ier of "Fncino Man" lame and his voice sounds nothing like Kmineni's, an apparent rarit \ fora contem

iiuisu around a full-time museum job. He is iiuiediblv talented, lie is iucredibh hard to follow. And his latest effort,
"Moat." 1 s one of the best albums most people will never heai
I hose who know the Xesop's sound will tell you that it is hard to classif\. ()ne reason l<»i this is that, 111 addition to pos
sessing .in iiu redible grasp ol the Fnglish language, be produces inan\ ol his own beats.
In the ( ase of "112 loat, he is m top form prodiu tion-wise as earh as the album's third tr.u k. "Big Bang." havering a dis-

Mthough a few of Ins beats are sub-par, Aesop Rock's ability to put forth other out

I lie ultimate strength of the album, howevei. lies in Aesop's unparalleled poetic abilitv. Releasing references ranging
Irom Kabuki to Dante's "111 lei no," he is. wit bout question, a thinking man's emcee. (>ne simph has to look at another quote
from the album: Tina so\ ereignt\ columnist, latliei ing tloom dot uineiit i ursed version of a certain Virgin Mary womb

are 11 ul\ remarkable.
I lowever, his intellet tual t apai it\ tan also be lus biggest downfall. lot ever\ line that masks a simple message 111 com
plex language, there is another that seems too abstract I'oi its own good. As a result, the album can become verv wearing
b\ the end of /(I minutes. Although shortei products exist in \esop s previous two efforts. "Music for K.arthwornis" and
"Appleseetl." both are unfortunate!) now out ol pi int. ()ue lias no clioit e but to engage in the full. 20-trai k experience.
In the end "Float." despite its abstrat tness, is a phenomenal venture. In a genre often marked b\ pimp anthems and
blatant sampling, Aesop Rot k and Blockhcatl take the listenet on a journev that is like no other, familiar fans will be
pleased with this latest t nation, while new listeners will be ama/ed that such hip hop actualK exists. One must commit t<>
spending a great amount ol energv when hitting the pla\ button on an Aesop Rock album. < )thei wise, one could easilv
mistake this musical inastei piece ft>i at ollet tiou ol ramhlinus.
