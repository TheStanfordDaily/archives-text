# 'Rhinos like it rough'

With the lack of dating at Stanford, students ma\ have to look rise
where lot romance on Feb. 14 ... maybe the San Francisco Zoo? Fea
turing its 12th Annual "Valentine's Day Sex Four," the zoo invites guests
fora two-hour trolley ride complemented with descriptions of mating
rituals, scrumptious truffles and champagne.
II most romantic getaways promise sweet-smelling roses and soil
classical music, the tour guide's discussion of kink\ animal sex practices
can be a fresh new way to experience the day of love.
The tout opened with a female ostrich, who, because of a hormonal
imbalance, thinks she is male and performed a male mating dance.
Most ol the tour, however, showed animals going about their ordinary
business, and guests simply listened to the tour guide talk about their
penises and sex life. For instance, while hearing about the zebras
"wham bam thank you ma'am" approach to sex (since the\ always have
to keep their eyes open for predators) is enticing to hear about, simul
taneously watt liing the striped animals slowly chew their food is some
how unfulfilling.

Of course, you couldn't expect the tour to be full of animals mating
nonstop. If would actually be pretty distasteful to watch an elephant
using its 40,000-muscle trunk to "pleasure others," which apparently is
what the animal does, according to our tour guide. The eloquent guide
also described African elephants' 50-pound penises as "heat seeking mis
siles because the guv can't really see what he's doing When he gets up
there." In this sense, a graphical presentation of the act was definitely
worth missing.
Although some tours miss it. there is a good chance of catching bono
bos (similar to chimps) engaging in sexual activity, since they make love
all the time with other males, females or both. At the San Francisro Zoo,
the bonobo named I'alula was the model for Yoda in C .eoige Lucas's
Star Wars. Who knows what Yoda really meant, when he told Luke, "Do
or do not, there is no try."
While there are graphic descriptions of all kinds of penises, from
the harpoon-like organ of the snail to the itty bitty endowments of
the polar bear, you can lx- comforted by the fact that the tour guide
prefers the code word "pickle" instead of "penis" for most of his
talk.
The smelly part of the tour involved rhinos who "like it rough," the
guide said. Of all mammals, rhinos apparently have the most violent
foreplay and sometimes even kill their partners. Fortunately (or unfor
tunately depending on how you get your kicks), we missed the rhino in
setting his cauliflower-shaped "pickle" in the female, a situation which
makes it hard for the male to pull out. Consequently, rhinos may stay
conjoined for hours post-mating.
For $50 a passenger, the tour may be a bit pricey for students look
ing for an exciting afternoon of animal sex. A better deal might be wait
ing in the grass of Wilbur field, if you can find a pair of banana slugs
there. The guide described how these slugs often get stuck in each other
during their acts of passion, and then have to chew themselves free.
The tours, limited to guests aged 18 years and older, run Feb. 17 and
18 at 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.
