I.ddie l//ard as (mstav Von
W'angetihcim — the original actor
who portrayed the victim in "Nos
leratn wearing thick makeup
that accentuates his eyes, mirrors
the audience's initial response to
Daloe, who, in lull makeup, is posi
tiveh frightening. Long fingernails,
lai ge incisors, pale complexion and

lots ol makeup (we're
talking three hours prep
time here) transform
Daloe into a believable
vampire.
Daloe's acting
makes the role ol the
vampire come to lilc,
and. without him,
"Shadow of the Vam
pire" would definitely
tall ll.it. Schreck obvi
ousb has no acting ex

Daloe's portrayal ol tlns con

\ll I Ins said, there are some slow
moments (the opening credits,

t.ike Idrever), and the lad that no
one, 111Hil ii is I(h> late, realizes
Sell reek's tine identity is just plain
unbelievable — not after finding a
llask ol blood, not because ol the
large wooden crosses or the large
strands o! garlic, not after watching
Sell reck attack the camera man,
not after watching him suck the
blood of a bat . . .
"Shadow ol the Vampire" realh
is a cinematic treat lor those who
love dai k coined). with stress on the
dark. Kxception.il acting on the part
ol Malkovich, Daloe and I/Aird,
beantilul cinematography and in
sane attention to detail that rivals
Miiinan's own insanity make
"Shadow ol the Vampire" well
worth the money.


The Goth look is like, so out, Willem
