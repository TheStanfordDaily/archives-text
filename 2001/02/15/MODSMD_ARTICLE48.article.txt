# Hanson masterfully recreates tortured humanity

### ERIC HAND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
1 he Duane Hanson retrospec
tive, < urrentlv headlining at the
s.m Jose Museum ol Art, wins an
award for the exhibit "Most likel\
to dupe a patron into asking an
inanimate security guard il pho
tographs is permitted." I almost
did. After realizing that the puta
tive securit\ guard was only one ol
Hanson's signature hypet real
sculptures, I went ahead and
began to lot us mv camera — onh
to he reprimanded by the real se
<uiit\ guard, who suddenly
loomed beside me.
Indeed, the line between illu
sion and reality at I lanson's show is
quite blurry. The sheer number of
sculptures on display compounds
the sense ol disquiet. As other view
ei s stop to contemplate the art, one
constantly confuses the observer
with the observed.
I veil up close, the realism ol the
si ulptures stands inspection. But
the virtuosity of realist expression
belies .in exacting, almost labori
ous. tei hni<jue. For example,"()ld
Woman in a Folding (lhair" shot ks
the viewer with its line attention to
detail: I he creases around the
woman's mouth and brow; her cal
low. jaundiced skin: her bruised
hands and varicose veins.
More shocking, however, is that
in order to model lot the sculp
ture, the old woman had to first
shave herself completely, lather
het nude body in petroleum jelly,
and then sit motionless lot hours as
I lanson applied a quick-setting sil
icone rubber that hardens into the
si ulpture's mold.
I hough Hanson was interested
in depicting the lethargic, slouch
ing positions ol evervdav lile. his

sculptures gestures and postures
eas\ to bold foi the long boni s
ol modeling — were chosen for
practical as well as aitistic reasons.
Altei peeling the molds «>ll the
models, Hanson injected .1 fiber
glass polyester resin mixture into
the mold cavities. Fhis mixture
then solidified and became tin
basic figure which Hanson then
adorned with clothes, human hair
and detailed flourishes ol oil
paints.
I lanson's te« hint al abilities, pio
neering for bis time (he began his
realist sculptures in the lOOOs), still
amaze us today. But his art is more
than just an exercise in photo-real
ism. Hanson himself argues that
the realism of the figures' exteriors
should remain subservient to a
concern "with what's going on in
side the sculptures."
An activist during the social tur
bulence of the HMiOs. Hanson
began In infusing his sculptures
with a political expressionism. In
theii violent depictions ol ravaged
human bodies, "Abortion." "<'.ang
land Victim" and "Chinese Stu
dent" display a moi e overt concern
with social issues of the da\.
But In the 19705, Hanson had
shifted to .1 more subtle concern
with the common malaise afflict
ing the "Fvervman." Strapping
Ins lurid, tragic political figures,
he decided instead to focus on the
more subdued tragedy of the
mundane.
llie liues of the predominantly
working-class sculptures are joy
less. with sad. averted eyes and
tightly pursed mouths. It is as if the
viewer has interrupted an internal
monologue in which the figure
somberU contemplates the "what
could have beens" in their life.
()neof the first sculptures 111 the

exhibit, "Cai Dealer,' ma\ he
dressed in a shirt and tie, hilt his
concerns are no less pccunian
than the povert\ apparent in
"Qneenie 11, a woi king-i lass jani
tor. ( ileal h .1 salesman of the Will)
l.oinan school, "(iar Dealer" best
exemplifies Hanson's desire to
show "lives olquiet desperation."
Nonetheless, main ol the fig
ures keep their < bins up in a united
displax of innei strength, as il Nan
son is interested in showing the
heroism inherent in the ordinan
a* t of survival. In"I louse I'aintei."
a tall bl.u k man strikes a statnes(|iie
pose, reminiscent ol Michelange
lo's "David." as he spatters blight
pink paint on the gallery wall. IU
"desei rating" the gallery wall with
such garish colors, the house
painter is, in eflect, lighting to
claim a space of his own, under
mining the imposition ol the
gallei \ spat e with a quiet, but res
olute defiant e.
After a while, the sculptures' illu
sorv qualih loses some of its novel
ty, and I lauson's i epetitive themes
begin to lose their resonance.
()ther In pet -realist s ( ulptors. pro
pelled b\ Hanson's pioneering
techniques, have created more in
novative work: Ron Mueck experi
ments with st ale (e.g. a 7-loot tall
teenage girl, or a .'Moot tall corpse)
as a means to approach issues of
death and ostracism, whereas Jake
and Dinos (ihapnian — also veter
ans of the shocking and now fa
mous "Sensation" exhibition —
play with anatomical forms in
order to explore and subvert tradi
tional notions of sexuality.
But I fanson, if anything, is < (in
sistent. My favorite piece in the
show was"I lea Market Vendor,"
where .111 overweight woman,
wearing a pink and turquoise T

shirt (declat ing "I'm a UK. deal"),
sits .iiid mindlessh monitors the
sale of unwanted used books .ind
crappy paintings: A piece of white
trash selling trash.
Il.iuson treated .1 piece of art
concerned with the art we throw
away at .1 garage sale. Just .is, in a
larger sense, I lanson has created a
piece ol lile-like sculpture con
cerned with the disposable lives

tli.it .lie so despondent tli.it the\
are hardly worth living, and might
as well be thrown awav.
While the woman's lilt- is (U\u l\
not a big deal, the issues raised In
Hanson's work are. A lantastu
gallery with intriguing ancillary e\
hibits, the San Jose Museuni ol
Art's retrospective ol Hanson's
wot k should not be missed. It runs
until April 1.
