Clevenger believes that former Inner Fast
parking lots have become "commuter lots" for
residents of otliei areas of campus, making it
difficult foi Inner Kast dorm residents to park
< lose to their homes.
Clevenger s first resolution called upon Ad
ministration "to act immcdiateh to re-segre
gate Inner Kast parking and to take decisive
action in this issue.
"I think absolutely nothing of significance is
being done, said C'.levenger at the meeting.
"The I niversity didn't even consult anyone
when thev consolidated the lots. So, the pur
pose of the resolutions is to s.iv. 'Look. \ou cre

ated this miss, clean n up.

"\lv strategy in creating these resolutions
w.is instil tit ionali/ing the parking issue so that it
wouldn't he |tist one gu\ —me — [approach
ing] Administration, he said. "I've tried to get
the C.S(. and the ASSl involved."
Members of the (.S(. heard (llevenger pre
sent several arguments fbi the adoption of his
resolutions. I he second of these detailed the
establishment of an Ad-Hoc ('.ommittee on
Parking.
I he (.ommittee s responsibilities would in
clude determining the building of additional
parking strut ttires on campus, recommending
.1 towing poll v and working with local elected
officials to enact laws mandating sufficient

pat king on campus.
Should the resolution on the Ad-1 lot (lom
mittee p.iss, ASS I' President and Vice-Presi
dent Setli Newton and Malia \'illegas would
serve as members. However, debate (lining
the (>S( meeting foc used upon (ilevenget s
approach towards the p.irking issue. Some
members felt more organization, 111 terms of
wide-stale advertisement and working
groups, was needed before the (iS( 1 could en
dorse the resolutions.
"1 don't think passing a bill or amendment is
the correct wav to go about tins." said (>S(.
chairman Paul Nartke. Others felt there were
alternative solutions. One member proposed
that the I niversit\ mail additional parking
permits, for lots such as ('.rothers llall. to resi
dents of Kast .ind Inner Fast campus dorms.
For residents, this option would increase the
chances of finding a parking space near their
homes.
With 110 closure on the issue, (iS(, members
agreed to reconvene in one week for further
disc tission.
