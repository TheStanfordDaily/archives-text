We soon meet

|osephine, plaved excel-

Irels that Bab\ only views her as
"a s.k k of sex and not a singer."
She resolves herself to celibacy
so that "only her songs will be
her children." Wilkins does well
to have Josephine and Baby f.ue
each other through the golden
mirror, for it is obvious that Mc-
Clure is concerned with the

artist's need for an astute (and
not just adoring) audience. But
much is lost in Mc('.lure's repeti
tive muddle of words.
About three-quarters of the
way through the play, we realize
that we haven't heard Josephine
sing. What is it that is so great
about her art and win is every
one fussing over it? While llin
kle mav be the best actor in the
cast, she is a bit more challenged
when it comes to song and
dance.

Nonetheless, she does her best
Kvita .nid sings along (h.ully) to
Rilev's Bjork-like music lor 10 lull
minutes. Is this supposed to he

Wilkens cannot possibly sus
tain a tongue-in-cheek tone for
the duration, so he has lus cast
play it straight. Ihe message,
driven home with such inter
minable insistence, is .ill too
dear: We are forced to consider
out duty to support the arts
even when the art itsell is of du
bious quality. A sentiment that,
the best efforts of the cast and
crew notwithstanding, sadly ap
plies to this particular pla\ and
playwright.
