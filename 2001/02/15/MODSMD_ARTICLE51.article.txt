# Ramin's Reel Deal

### RAMIN SETOODEH 
Pardon im\ Sir Anthony I lopkins, but your Cannibal needs lietter table manners.
Don't get me wrong: 1 understand that yon need to least on human beings, \ftei all, it
is part ol your appeal. In lad, Dr. I .ecter's dining habits alone sm ked no pun intend
ed millions of movie-goers into seeing "I lannibal" this past weekend.
Ml I'm asking is that you select your vic tims a little more carefully. Win munch on a
i andom Joe when there are so many other tasty treats at your disposal?
My suggestion: Go after movie stars. But not those with talent. Where would the (>s
(.u sbe without regulars like Meryl Streep and lorn 11.inks? Instead, least your sights on
those ever-so-annoying, emotionless suds in Hollywood. To make your job easier, I've
even conjured up a menu. After all, most cannibals are too busy to keep up with the world
<>i movies. Hon appetite: Here are the top 10 most pathetic movie stars th.it make us
whine, wince and wiggle in our seats at the movies.
10. |ason "Rack of l*imb" Biggs. Ever since appearing in "American Pie," this one
dimensional star has flopped in some ol the most unimaginative teen links ever.
Hons and Girls" was just about as inventive as its title suggests and "Loser" was cer
tainly no winner. And as for "Saving Silverman," which opened last Friday, it is al
ready a strong competitor lor the worst film of 2001. Dining suggestion: Munch em
up good.
9. Joshua "Pork C .hops" Jackson. I'm sure he has a stalwart fan base of supporters who
followed him to the movies from 1 As "Dawson's Creek." Hut let's be honest: I le can't act.
In " flic* Skulls," he wavered through one of the most jaw-droppingly bad thrillers in recent
memory. I hen there was that bit role he had in "(iossip," a movie that died just about as last
as Ins chances lor ()scar consideration. Add a little salt and he tastes |iis! like < lik ken.
S. Hrendan "Roast Heel' Eraser. I don't care what others think - there has nevei been a
decent Frasei Ilic k. " The Mummy?" An incoherent plot, "George ol the |iinglc?" I'd rathet
see Leslie Nielsen in "Mr. Magi." Note: Do not serve with Li/. Hurley (see "Beda/./.lecf").
7. Marlon "Sushi" Wayans. Ry far the most annoying Wayans brother (which, believe
me. sa\s a lot), he smoked up the screen in "Scary Movie." Hut he is even more unsavory
in his earlier works, "Senseless" and"The Sixth Man. Wayans is the pet lec t example ot
no-talent acting at its worst. Listen here: Eat up.
I> |anet "Shrimp" Jackson. (>ka\ —she hasn't exactly had the niosi expansive movie
career. Hut her latest performance (and I use that word sparingly) m"The Nutt\ Proles
sor 11 I lie Klutups" was atrocious, at best. She smiled so much that I thought she was stai
i mm in.i toothpaste commercial. Serving instructions: Pre heat to defrost that pl.istic ex
pression on her face.
T». Benjamin "Frog Legs" Bratt. Sorry Julia, but your boyfriend acts like a still
cut out of cardboard. In"The Next Best Filing," he provided absolutely noon
screen chemistry with Madonna. I hen there was "Miss Congeniality." where lie
shifted and staggered alongside Sandra Bullock. W.u ning: Remove bones before
eating.
I. "M\stery Meat" Madonna. While we're on the topic ol still ac ting, she not onl\ takes
the cake but performs a yoga lesson around it. I hen there is her accent, which suspicioush
sounds neither Hritish nor Americ an. (lautiou: T his Material (.it I doesn't come with am
lastv material.
Matthew "('.heap Lobster" McConaughey. Eorget the Southern accent and that
sheepish grin. Go see his performance in "'l'lie Wedding Planner. ()n second thought,
don't. I rust the chef on this one: Chance of food poisoning.
LV Keanu "French Fries" Reeves. So much to criticize, so little time. Sure." Ihe Matrix
was great. Hut that movie relied on special ellects, with Reeves lloating as abac kdrop,
flunk " I'lie Replacements." Think "The Watcher." Flunk: Refund.
I Adam "Rotten Porridge" Sandler. Without a doubt, the most over-rated ac tor in I lol
ly wood. ()h. all the precious minutes spent .it his movies — time that I could have spent
i imiiiiaging through garbage dumps or c lipping niv toenails. I lis voice spews baby gib
bel isli and his on-screen persona seems to stay at that constantly annoy ing level through
all his roles. Rest case scenario: Ile has the emotive range ola Kentiu ky Fried ("hit ken,
.ind he might just taste like one, 100.

see Leslie Nielsen in "Mr. Magi." Note: Do not serve with Li/. Hurley (see "Beda/./.lecf").
7. Marlon "Sushi" Wayans. Ry far the most annoying Wayans brother (which, believe
me. sa\s a lot), he smoked up the screen in "Scary Movie." Hut he is even more unsavory
in his earlier works, "Senseless" and"The Sixth Man. Wayans is the pet lec t example ot
no-talent acting at its worst. Listen here: Eat up.
I> |anet "Shrimp" Jackson. (>ka\ —she hasn't exactly had the niosi expansive movie
career. Hut her latest performance (and I use that word sparingly) m"The Nutt\ Proles
sor 11 I lie Klutups" was atrocious, at best. She smiled so much that I thought she was stai
i mm in.i toothpaste commercial. Serving instructions: Pre heat to defrost that pl.istic ex
pression on her face.
T». Benjamin "Frog Legs" Bratt. Sorry Julia, but your boyfriend acts like a still
cut out of cardboard. In"The Next Best Filing," he provided absolutely noon
screen chemistry with Madonna. I hen there was "Miss Congeniality." where lie
shifted and staggered alongside Sandra Bullock. W.u ning: Remove bones before
eating.
I. "M\stery Meat" Madonna. While we're on the topic ol still ac ting, she not onl\ takes
the cake but performs a yoga lesson around it. I hen there is her accent, which suspicioush
sounds neither Hritish nor Americ an. (lautiou: T his Material (.it I doesn't come with am
lastv material.
Matthew "('.heap Lobster" McConaughey. Eorget the Southern accent and that
sheepish grin. Go see his performance in "'l'lie Wedding Planner. ()n second thought,
don't. I rust the chef on this one: Chance of food poisoning.
LV Keanu "French Fries" Reeves. So much to criticize, so little time. Sure." Ihe Matrix
was great. Hut that movie relied on special ellects, with Reeves lloating as abac kdrop,
flunk " I'lie Replacements." Think "The Watcher." Flunk: Refund.
I Adam "Rotten Porridge" Sandler. Without a doubt, the most over-rated ac tor in I lol
ly wood. ()h. all the precious minutes spent .it his movies — time that I could have spent
i imiiiiaging through garbage dumps or c lipping niv toenails. I lis voice spews baby gib
bel isli and his on-screen persona seems to stay at that constantly annoy ing level through
all his roles. Rest case scenario: Ile has the emotive range ola Kentiu ky Fried ("hit ken,
.ind he might just taste like one, 100.
