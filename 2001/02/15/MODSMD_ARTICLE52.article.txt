### NEGAR AZIMI BLAIR TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITERS 
Arguably the only high-end Asian restau
rant in Palo Alio (note that there is a San Fran
cisco equivalent), Straits (4tle cooks up some
delovely Singaporean cuisine lot you to
delect upon. 'I hough we cannot call ourselves
connoisseurs of all tilings Singaporean, we
did catch on to obvious I'an-Asian influence
throughout the menu — a grand Indone
sian, Malaysian, Chinese and Indian amalga
mation. Asia is refreshingly fused to itself (as
opposed to being asked to provide the New in
New French, New American and soon).
We took a chance on a Friday night with
out reservations; we are not alone in recog
nizing that Straits is in a league of it own
around about these here parts. We entered
unannounced into the restaurant com
pound, a rectangular bit of real estate en
closed by what looks like a glassy shower wall
that serves as a barrier betwixt the precious,
well-heated patio and rumbling F.I ('.amino.
Indeed, upon entrance, we found our
selves knee-deep in throngs of peoples seek
ing exotic eats. And what eclectic peoples
they were: some chic locals with family in
tow, some others of the Silicon variety and
the rest honest hungry folk like us. Slightly
daunted In the mass, we consoled out selves
with a bottle ol Bonn) I loon ( hard. ()ur se
lection process was governed by some shod
dy combination of meager wine knowledge
and our price range. There was no cork
sniffing: We went straight to the pour and
imbibe, but the wine proved more than de
cent in the end.
.Also assisting us with the 45-minute plus
wait (you can eat appsat the bar) was the I'oh
I'ia, an ensemble of fresh spring roles borne
of jicama. carrots, egg, ground peanuts. (Ihi
nesc sausage and prawns laid to rest in a bed
of spicy plum sauce. We forwent the sausage
— it suited neither our tastes nor the fine bal
ance of the dish.
At l« >ng last we were seated outside, which
usually makes us nervous given exposure to
the elements and such, but in this case it was
a good thing. It took us another 30 minutes
to put in our dinner order. It was at this
[X)int dtat we realized and acknowledged
how damn long we'd been at Straits . .. but
we also acknowledged that this was a non

issue, Ining that we were well-sauced and
had l'oh l*ia under our belts.
To eat: Bijang. Hai Nan Chicken Rice
and Origami Sea Bass. We ate family-style
(feeling intimate with our partner in gas
tronomy, Julie, as we moved on to our sec
ond bottle). Hie sweet and sour eggplant
with mixed peppers (bijang) was gloriously
purple, gleaming in die wa\ of the plump
aulxrgine (n.b. fetish). Also delicious was the
chicken, served in breasts with ginger nee
and litde attendant dishes of chili-ginger
sauce and a miso-esque broth. The sea bass
came in a lidded paper bag. It was the most
understated of the three, but by no means
did we neglect it as we passed plates about
the table.
Toensurethat we spent no less than three
hours at the restaurant, we ordered two
desserts, kueh Dada proved to be a genius
dish composed of a grass-green, fhickish
crepe filled with coconut and pineapple and
topped with coconut sorbet. It has the
friendliest consistent v, and we soaked up
every drop oI sorbet. Our second selection,
Sago Pudding, lies somewhere in the ob
scure but luscious overlap of tapioca and
c aviar. Don't be mistaken, the flavor shares
nothing with salt\ fish eggs, but Sago's tasty
orbs do have a texture and plumpness more
akin to caviar than to the runny blend of
your run-of-the-mill tapioca. Both desserts
made us giggle with their outlandish colors
and grains, but the taste of each was fierc ely
good ... no laughing matter.
Only when we pried ourselves from the
romantic climes of the patio did we realize
we had shut the place down ... babies and
businessmen long since laid clown to rest.
Our bottom line: Don't go if you are in a
rush or are feeling 112 rugal or shy about Pan-
Asia, but in all other c ases (e.g. unengaged,
ignorant of debt owed, etc.), git yerself to
Straits immediately.
Straits is open for lunch daily from 11:30

lection process was governed by some shod
dy combination of meager wine knowledge
and our price range. There was no cork
sniffing: We went straight to the pour and
imbibe, but the wine proved more than de
cent in the end.
.Also assisting us with the 45-minute plus
wait (you can eat appsat the bar) was the I'oh
I'ia, an ensemble of fresh spring roles borne
of jicama. carrots, egg, ground peanuts. (Ihi
nesc sausage and prawns laid to rest in a bed
of spicy plum sauce. We forwent the sausage
— it suited neither our tastes nor the fine bal
ance of the dish.
At l« >ng last we were seated outside, which
usually makes us nervous given exposure to
the elements and such, but in this case it was
a good thing. It took us another 30 minutes
to put in our dinner order. It was at this
[X)int dtat we realized and acknowledged
how damn long we'd been at Straits . .. but
we also acknowledged that this was a non

issue, Ining that we were well-sauced and
had l'oh l*ia under our belts.
To eat: Bijang. Hai Nan Chicken Rice
and Origami Sea Bass. We ate family-style
(feeling intimate with our partner in gas
tronomy, Julie, as we moved on to our sec
ond bottle). Hie sweet and sour eggplant
with mixed peppers (bijang) was gloriously
purple, gleaming in die wa\ of the plump
aulxrgine (n.b. fetish). Also delicious was the
chicken, served in breasts with ginger nee
and litde attendant dishes of chili-ginger
sauce and a miso-esque broth. The sea bass
came in a lidded paper bag. It was the most
understated of the three, but by no means
did we neglect it as we passed plates about
the table.
Toensurethat we spent no less than three
hours at the restaurant, we ordered two
desserts, kueh Dada proved to be a genius
dish composed of a grass-green, fhickish
crepe filled with coconut and pineapple and
topped with coconut sorbet. It has the
friendliest consistent v, and we soaked up
every drop oI sorbet. Our second selection,
Sago Pudding, lies somewhere in the ob
scure but luscious overlap of tapioca and
c aviar. Don't be mistaken, the flavor shares
nothing with salt\ fish eggs, but Sago's tasty
orbs do have a texture and plumpness more
akin to caviar than to the runny blend of
your run-of-the-mill tapioca. Both desserts
made us giggle with their outlandish colors
and grains, but the taste of each was fierc ely
good ... no laughing matter.
Only when we pried ourselves from the
romantic climes of the patio did we realize
we had shut the place down ... babies and
businessmen long since laid clown to rest.
Our bottom line: Don't go if you are in a
rush or are feeling 112 rugal or shy about Pan-
Asia, but in all other c ases (e.g. unengaged,
ignorant of debt owed, etc.), git yerself to
Straits immediately.
