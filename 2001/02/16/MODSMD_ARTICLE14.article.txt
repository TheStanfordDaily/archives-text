smuggle arms and explosive into
Palestinian territories. Maj. Gen.
Yaakov Or, coordinator of Israeli
activities, said the issue of VIP
passes must be re-examined.
Meanwhile, Arafat repeated his
charge that Israel is using a new
form of gas. stronger than tear
gas, in the southern Gaza Strip.
The Israeli military called the alle
gation "a lie."
