## The
						Stanford Daily Efforts to improve housing situation promising 
### 
Published Since IS')I

STANFORD IS MAKINCi significant
moves to improve undergraduate
housing conditions. We applaud the ef
forts of the University to make more
spare available on campus and to make th.it
space more livable. At the same time, we are
concerned about the effects of these changes
on the student community and, spec ifically, the
freshman class.
While new housing is a pressing issue, the up
keep of old buildings is also c ruc ial. The reno
vation of Br, inner 11 all is a necessan and timelv
move. Similar recent renovations of loyon Hall
have improved the residence greatly.
Regrettably, the renovations will produce a
further strain on residenti.il availability. And,
housing concerns aside, the loss of a large all
freshman dorm, and Branner in particular, is a
sad event.

Branner has provided a means ol solidarit\
for Stanford freshmen. I hose in Branner tend
to form a tight communitx in then first vear;
those outside Branner bond in allegiance to the
motto "Branner sue ks.
Like- the Stanford-( al rivaln at its best, the
non-Branner-Branner rivaln brings together
newcomers to the campus in a frienclK loi illa
tion of identity. Next year s freshmen will have
to find .i wav to overcome this loss ,md keep a
healthy spirit without the monumental contri
bution of this all-frosh cloi in.
Advisers, resident fellows and resident stall
will need to pa\ spec ial .itlention to the needs
of the new Brainier-less c lass. More c lass events
and community-building will be needed to
compensate for the lac k of a target foi li iendK
polari/ation. Intramural sports and .ill-class
events would help to maintain heslunan (ill

lure in the absence of binary contingents.
Stanford lias shown an aptitude for flexibilitv.
Kai ingan incredible bousing crunch, the I niver
sii\ lias found some great short-term solutions.
I sing the Sharon (ireen apartments as housing
loi students returning from abroad was a wise
strategy for coping with the immediate crisis.
I he Sharon (ireen complex is located about
a mile fr<>in campus, however, and is extremely
inconvenient foi students without cat s. Recog
nizing this difficulty, the I Diversity is planning
to teinpotariK convert the two-person apart
ments in Mirrielees into triples. I he solution
will provide on-campus housing for 150 more
undergraduates.
Naturally, this means less space for individu
als in Mirrielees. hut, given the time constraints,
the solution is a good one.
However, we expect to see the I niversitv

earn through on its commitment to return
the apartments to their status as double-occu
panev housing once more housing lias been
built. Ihe tin\ doubles in l.agunita Court
were born of a similar short-term solution that
wound up being permanent. I lie trend ol
moving students into ever-smaller spaces
must not continue.
Another concern with filling up Mirrielees is
that more people will be pushed to the outskirts
of campus. While Mirrielees is an improvement
over Sharon (ireen in terms of accessibility, it is
well outside of central campus and known for its
insularity and isolation. 1 his is why Mirrielees
should be a temporary solution.
We encourage the speedy development of
this ,md other new housing facilities, as well as a
heightened focus on long-term housing solu
tions and communitv-building for freshmen.
