# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Intolerance reconsidered 
### STEPHEN SMITH GUET COLUMNIST 
In the last lew weeks, .1 great debate lias
raged 111 the pages of I he D.iih and across
campus over F. \V. de Klerk's receni visii.
Protesters disrupted de Klerk's speech at
Kresge Auditorium. But students need to
remember that reconciliation, and not re
( rimination, will be South Afrii as salvation.
Apartheid is dead, and South Africa is
in the midst of its second freel\-elei ted ad
ministration. Some members ol the Stan
ford communitv prefer to fbc us on the in
ecjuit\ of South Africa's past rathet than
today's rising egalitariatiism. I hose who
linger over the injustices of vcsterda\ are
now part of the problem. South Aft ii a has
moved on: (lan we?
In the eat 1\ 19905, a numbei of factors
saved South Africa from national suicide.
Kev among them was the emei genceof an
imaginative cache of politi
cal Icadct s c apable of addressing black as
pirations of majoritv rule and calming
white fears of powei lessness in a predcun
inantlv black societv. Mandela was one of
these; de Klerk was another.
De Klet k himself one e asked, "Ilow do
you get off the back ola tigei without his
turning around and eating vou?" In end
ing apartheid, cle Klerk willingh
marginali/ed Ins white constituency. Since
Ins departure, some white South Africans
have undertaken a racial remobili/ation,
placing .i white-supremacist leadership at
the head of the New Nationalist l'artv.
I he question is this: Was cle Klet k part
of the problem or part of the solution? An
swer: Both. Leading the elite tninoritv 111
maintaining the old regime was an easv
job he gave up in 199*1 to help lead the
transition to a new. majoritv-governed
South Aft ica.
Now that de Klerk is no longer in
power, how will historv judge him?
I have seen the debate ovet de Klerk's
visit congeal into a debate ovet whether or
not de Klerk should be condemned for the
sins of the system and his conformity to it.
I have seen this, and I am sick of it.

In .1 recent request lot protest, nine dif
ferent student organizations alleged that
"allowing [de l\leik| to leave Stanford tin
i hallengccl would be an insult to the masses
of people that Mi uggled to hi itig apai theid
to .m end." I lie sii uggle (onsutned and. at
limes, stole the lives of the masses.
As fin as I can tell, the onl\ \\a\ to insult
them would be to forget how precious an
object is libertv. \nd how precious the
leaders that obtained and preserved it. I
believe the masses would disagree with the
student organiz.itions advocating protests.
De Klerk was the leadei most directl\ re
sponsible for abolishing apartheid, lbs
signature sealed the executive ordei end
ing (lie institution.
In inv father had the opportuni
ty to vote fora free South Africa foi the
first time. Ignorance of the past is unac
ceptable. and it is a c rime to let tlu- past
sliac kle the present or. worse, ci ipple oin
future. We should not let memories of a
cruel past obviate the cleansing powei of
the first free election. Flawed as he is, De
Klerk helped give South Africa an honest
chance to achieve a fi ee socielv.
I am South African \merican. \l\ fa
ther is a hybrid, the son of an Fnglish man
and an Afrikaner. As a student, he fought
apartheid as an organizet tor the National
I nion of South African Students. Liter,
he as an undercover operative for the
African National Congress. I have even
reason to oppose those who maintained
apartheid.
I he l.akota American Indians sa\ n is
best fora man to dismount when he discov
ers he is riding a dead horse. Protesters and
columnists should take heed. Apartheid is
alive now only in the minds and hearts of
those who cannot let go of the past. De
Klerk gave South Africa back to democracy
and back to majority rule, lie did this at
great risk to himself and Ins party. I ,ct cred
it go where it is due: De Klerk is worthy of
respect.
