Tiger salamanders not endangered
I lie position of the tigci salamander,
Inibystoimi tignmini, as an endangered
species frequently surfaces whenevei
construction is planned on or near the
Stanford I ni\ersit\ ( anipus.
In a survey of tlu- literature, no evi
dence seems to surface that the spec ics is
an endangered one." Ihe ()flit ial Wot Id
Wildlife (iuidc to Fndanget ed Spec ies of
North America. b\ David Lowe, does
not list this species of salamander as
being endangered.
Further, it is not included as being so
in Deborah Jamison's pamphlet,
"Spec ies in Danger in Out Own Back

yard." Peninsula Conservation Center
Foundation, Palo Alto. I WW.
I bis salamander lives and survives in
a wide range of habit.its from sea level
to altitudes over !U)()0 feet, in forests,
meadows, woodlands, open fields,
grasslands and even in deserts. Some
taxouomists place I ligrmiim ralifonni
ws as a separate subspecies of the parent
one. but this view is not generally
accepted.
I lie available information does not
place the tiger salamander on the en
dangered list of annuals.
