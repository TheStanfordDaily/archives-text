## Resurgent Cardinal battles Cal 
### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
When the Stanford women's
basketball team met ('.alitornia on
|an. 20, it was a battle for pride,
not tor ,i spot at the top of the
standings. Both teams had sput
tered to l-!t Pacific 10 Confer
ence records and had basicalh
put aside am notion ot a confer
ence title.
While the C ardinal came out
ot the game with a win, the
sloppy, inconsistent plav ot both
teams left the tans at Haas Pavil
ion feeling that Bav Area
women's basketball was plum
meting to ilie depths ot Pac-10
obscurity.
However, whether that game
served as a wake-up call or both
teams have found a sudden for
mula tor success, both Stanford
(1 1-7, N-.S Pat -10) and ('.al (10-1 I.
0-3) have redefined themselves
as serious conference title con
tenders in recent weeks.
Stanford is tiding a seven
game < onterence w inning streak,
beginning with its win over the
Golden Bears. After several ad
justments at the point guard po
sition, the Cardinal finds itself in
a three-wa\ tie for first place in
the conference and the hot team
to beat in the second half ot the
season,
California lias picked up the
pace as well, w inning si\ ot its last
eight games including a recent
tour-game streak, its longest
stretch since the 1991-1992 sea
son. Behind the pla\ of explosive
senior guards C.ourtnev |ohnson
and Kenva Corlcy, the Golden
Bears have worked their wav up
to foin tli in the conference stand
ings, just two games out of the
coveted first place spot.

most competitive Bav Area
women's basketball match-ups i.i

"We are verv excited about it,"

when we are plaving them, so we
are excited thev are plaving

The game ton es a clash of two
opposite stvles of plav.
Gill's strength lies in its quick,
athletic guards. In both Gorle\
and Johnson, the team showcases
players that like to slash, steal and
speed tlicit wav to the basket.

respectively — lack in si/e, the\

While the guard duo leads the
team in scoring, each averaging
just over I'l points per game,
thev have help from some of the
team's post plavers. Lauren Ash
baugli and Ami Forney have
given California a solid offensive
presence inside, as well as superb
help on the boards.
Meanwhile, the Stanford
squad's strengths are its si/e and
depth. While the Cardinal does
not have any small guards that
can keep up with |olmson and
('.orlev. the team's added si/e w ill
allow it to exploit some of those
matchups at the offensive end.
