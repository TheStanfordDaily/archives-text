I here's .1 dirtv little secret that's
been overshadowed I>\ Stanford s
recent dominance on the hard
wood, and it nia\ be hat d foi even
the most devout C.ardinal hacker
or (iolden Bear tan to accept.
Stanford and ( lalitornia. or at
least their respective basketball
teams, don't reall\ hate each
other.
After all, Cardinal head coach
Mike Montgomen sent Ins team's
bus back for the (lolden Bears
after theirs broke down at the air
port 111 ()regon last weekend. And
redshirt freshman lot ward Justin
Davis neai 1\ went to ( al to pla\ for

coach Ben Brauu. And mam ot
the Stanford pla\ers maintain
friendships with ( al plavers. In
fad, the teams shared .1 plane to
Oregon and traded stories about
their (oat hi 1154 si.ills.
1 he goodwill, though, stops as
soon as both teams step onto the
court. In last inoiiih s <s Si.m
lotd win, the battle on the court
mi ned into a WW F-stvlebi awl, re
plete with headl(H'ks, takedowns
and smack-talk living between
both sides.
Will it be am different tomor
row, when the two teams meet tor
the filial time this season? Doubt
ful. especialh given the hostile at
mosphere that is sure to await the-
No. 2 Cardinal (22-1, 10-1 Pacific
10C .onterence) in its second \ isit to
I la.is Pavilion.
A sellout crowd of 12,272 Cal
fans hungry tor an upset will no
doubt make lite miserable for
Stanford as the team looks tor its
ninth consecutive win over the
(iolden Bears (17-f>, S-3).
"They're going to pla\ hard all
the way through," said senior for
ward Jan on Collins, who will lace
Cal tor the final time in his career.
"They're not going to quit, and
their crowd is not going to let them
quit."
This is crunch time tor Cal,
which currently stands in fourth
place in the Pat 10 and laces a slate
ot tough games after Stanford: at
I SC. and UCLA, and at home
against Arizona. The Golden
Bears will probably make the
NCAA Tournament, but they
need a couple wins out ot that
tough stretch to cement their spot
in t lie field of 65.
Against their biggest rival, at
home, the timing couldn't be bet
ter fora big win.
"This is a huge game for them,"

said redshirt sophomore center
Jason Collins. "We're the No. 2
team in the nation, going on their
home court, and we've been beat
ing them consistenth ... 1 think
thex re tired of losing to us."
Cal torward Sean Lunplcv, the
heart and soul ol the (ioldcn Bears,
is the team's top offensive threat and
a candidate for Pat-10 Plavet of the
Year who is sine to get bis points
onewa\ or another talented as he
is, Uimple\ i annot do everything h\
himsclt. and someone else will have
to step up foi Braun it'an upset is in
the making.
"The\ go to Lamplex even
more now than before, and lie's
basitalb canietl the team, jason
Collins said. "The\ have some
guvs wlu>can put up numbers, but
lie's basitalb the liist option and
the last option."
Asked who could potcntialb
have a big game tor Cal, Collins
named Brian Wetheis, who scored
IS against Stanford last month,
and point guard Shantav l.cgans.
Wethers is athletic, but a streakv
shooter from the U-point an wlio
tan get hot. while Legans is a tin\
(listed at r>-lbot-10. but likeb two
inches shorter), tjin< k guard who
runs the offense and (an shoot the
three well.
(la I will have to match upon the
defensive end as well, and that's

where Jarron Collins thinks the
m.iti hups favor Stanford, especial
1\ on the inside. Both lie and his
hrother played well in last month's
game, with Jason'dropping in 13
points and Jat ron shooting S-01-12
to score 18 while being guarded l>\
I .atnplev.
I le's a big-time plaver. and he's
a tremendous talent offensively,"
Jarron said, "but I'm going to 11 \ to
exploit him .i little bit on the defen
sive end. weal him out a little."
Both ( ollins twins tan onlv be

Rvan Metule/ and Case\ |atob

time for tomorrow's game, both
w nig pla\ei s seem to be breaking
otn of mini-slumps that had the
Cardinal's 3-point percent.ige
plummeting.
I he two combined to make t>-
of-10 attempts from behind the arc
last week against ()regon State.
On the medical front, sopho
more guard Julius Barnes's ankles
appeared to be almost back to nor

out the I ( LA game and played
limited minutes on the Oregon
trip. Sophomore center Curtis
Borchardt, however, did not par

I here's .1 dirtv little secret that's
been overshadowed I>\ Stanford s
recent dominance on the hard
wood, and it nia\ be hat d foi even
the most devout C.ardinal hacker
or (iolden Bear tan to accept.
Stanford and ( lalitornia. or at
least their respective basketball
teams, don't reall\ hate each
other.
After all, Cardinal head coach
Mike Montgomen sent Ins team's
bus back for the (lolden Bears
after theirs broke down at the air
port 111 ()regon last weekend. And
redshirt freshman lot ward Justin
Davis neai 1\ went to ( al to pla\ for

coach Ben Brauu. And mam ot
the Stanford pla\ers maintain
friendships with ( al plavers. In
fad, the teams shared .1 plane to
Oregon and traded stories about
their (oat hi 1154 si.ills.
1 he goodwill, though, stops as
soon as both teams step onto the
court. In last inoiiih s <s Si.m
lotd win, the battle on the court
mi ned into a WW F-stvlebi awl, re
plete with headl(H'ks, takedowns
and smack-talk living between
both sides.
Will it be am different tomor
row, when the two teams meet tor
the filial time this season? Doubt
ful. especialh given the hostile at
mosphere that is sure to await the-
No. 2 Cardinal (22-1, 10-1 Pacific
10C .onterence) in its second \ isit to
I la.is Pavilion.
A sellout crowd of 12,272 Cal
fans hungry tor an upset will no
doubt make lite miserable for
Stanford as the team looks tor its
ninth consecutive win over the
(iolden Bears (17-f>, S-3).
"They're going to pla\ hard all
the way through," said senior for
ward Jan on Collins, who will lace
Cal tor the final time in his career.
"They're not going to quit, and
their crowd is not going to let them
quit."
This is crunch time tor Cal,
which currently stands in fourth
place in the Pat 10 and laces a slate
ot tough games after Stanford: at
I SC. and UCLA, and at home
against Arizona. The Golden
Bears will probably make the
NCAA Tournament, but they
need a couple wins out ot that
tough stretch to cement their spot
in t lie field of 65.
Against their biggest rival, at
home, the timing couldn't be bet
ter fora big win.
"This is a huge game for them,"

said redshirt sophomore center
Jason Collins. "We're the No. 2
team in the nation, going on their
home court, and we've been beat
ing them consistenth ... 1 think
thex re tired of losing to us."
Cal torward Sean Lunplcv, the
heart and soul ol the (ioldcn Bears,
is the team's top offensive threat and
a candidate for Pat-10 Plavet of the
Year who is sine to get bis points
onewa\ or another talented as he
is, Uimple\ i annot do everything h\
