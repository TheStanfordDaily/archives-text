### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Be fore the season began, head coach
Mark Marquess would have gladly taken
a .500 record heading into this week
end's series in Austin against the I tiivcr
sityof Texas Longhorns.
As it stands, however, his young ball
dub is 7-3 and playing beyond anyone's
expectations despite one of the most dif
ti( ult schedules in the nation.
I lie No. 9 Cardinal could have easily
caved under the pressure of plaving the
same try ing schedule that last year's Col
lege World Series-finalist team battled.
Instead, Marquess has his players bring
ing .i fresh approach to every game, bat
tling for roster spots and showing the rest
of the country that any claims that the
team is "rebuilding" are unfounded.
"No question, this team is much fur
ther ahead than I thought it would be,"
Marquess said. "I'm quite pleased, espe
cially since we've played sevÂ£n of our first
10 on the road."
Nonetheless, Marquess cannot help
but worry about the 40 games that re

main on Stanford's schedule. Despite Ins
team's earh success, "there is no guaran
tee with a voung team that it will contin
ue to plav like that, he said.
T he Cardinal, which cracked the top
10 in the polls for the fii si time this season
on Monday, heads into Austin to face a
veteran of last year's College World Se
ries for the second week in a row. I he
Longhorns (5-4) are somewhat depleted
