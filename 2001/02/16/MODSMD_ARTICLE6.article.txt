Dietrit h, a sophomore, is the president of
the Stanford I ask fort eon Sustainable Build
ing. Formerly known as the Sustainabilih
i ask Force at Stanford, this eight to lOpei son
organization, which was founded last spring,
promotes the construction ofenvironment-ac
commtKlating buildings on campus. Recentlv,
the group submitted .1 letter to the Hoard of
Trustees regarding "green" buildings.
Green buildings promote more environ
mentallv-cooperativc features that can help
conserve energv and elect ricit\.
I lie term "encompasses a lot of different
things," Dietrich said. "But basicalh it's how
cartli-friendh vour building is."
The letter to the Board will be reviewed
earh next week to determine whethei or not
the Task Force will be able to speak to the
Board of Trustees at the Hoard's April meet

Sophomore |onathan Neril, a niembei of
the t.isk force, said that the prop< »sal consists of
two gt).ils.

"< )ne [aimj is to require an objective sus
lainabilih study during the initial planning
stages loi am new built ling, he said." Ihe set -
one! objet ti\r is to adopt standardized meth
ods of measuring and reptu ting the environ
mental pel forniant e and related < ost of Stan
ford's buildings."
"I Ititnateh. we would like a sustainability
review of all proposed projects before aichi
te<ts are even hired." Dietrich said. "All im
portant thing to understand about green
building is 1 hat the earlier von conceive the
methods, the more eflet live vou are."
I )icti it h noted tli.it. when it tomes to main
taining environmentally friendh measures,
Stanford is falling behind othei universities.
Windows fating south, foi example, could
drasticalh reduce the aniount of electricity .1
building uses Ix't ause the\ let cive more direct
sunlight than those fa< ing 1101 ill, she said.
"Abunt h of othci s< liools have implement
ed othei things, and we think thai Stanford —
the leading institution should teach bv ex
ample and show the |benefiis| of efficiency
building." 1 )eitric h saitl.
Dietrich einphasizetl that the organization
wants to raise student a\\ ireness alxiut. the
task foil e's eflblls.
"()ui gt>al is to 11 \to get pet>ple aware of
these issue s.'" Dietrit h said. " I here's an ener
in crisis that's ifoine 011 in ( alifornia and in
Stanford. Natural gas prices are ris
ing. and that's a huge deal that'll im
pact us."
(irad\ Jackson, one ot the law
s( hool students who joined the or
ganization this vear, partic ip.ites Ik--
c ause he wants to help the Stanford
communitx.
"In a nutshell, 1 think that, when
a person considers Stanford .is an
institution and the role of Stanford
in s< k iet\, the wa\ foi it is clear."
Jackson said. "Knerg\ effu ient pro
grams are light foi Stanford's hud
get. foi the health of its students, tor
the role of the I nivei sit\ as a sex ial
moderator and foi the environ
mental health of our generation
and future generations."
I lowever, (>ue<>f the majc>r barri
ei s that the task force faces is fund
ing. According to Dietrich, green

building can require substantial
extra costs, which the task force
hopes to raise.
"We're hoping to find donors,
alumni 01 corporations who would
he interested in making a donation
to the I niversit\ specifically tor sus
tainahilitv." Dietrich said. "It makes
a huge difference, and we're work
ing on it."
According to \eril. 111 the long
run, green building could poten
tially even save the Universitv
money.
"At .1 time w hen Stanford has ex
perienced two blackouts in two
weeks .ind energ\ costs are rapidh
in< 1 easing," Nenl said. (ireen build
ing senesasa promising wa\ to save
the I niversitN nione\ and reduce
etiergA costs."
Phillip (olien, administrative cli
rector for the |asper Ridge Biologi
cal Reserve, agreed that costs
shouldn't be too large.i problem tor
implementing the proposal.
"I think therearecertainh mam

wavs that sustainable features c an Ik
incorporated in building designs
with little or no cost implications."
Cohen said. "In tact, if the lite cycle
cost of the building j s factored in,
such strategies almost certainh re
duce c< >sts.'
Aside from their letter to the
Board of I rustees. the task force has
composed another lettei to the
members of the facult\ in order to
garner support for its cause. Cur
rently, about 'Jf> faculty memlxTs
have voiced support then proposal,
according to Neril.
('.olien stated that the task time's
suggestions at e plausible.
"1 am certain that it is leastmahlc
to expect that sustainable building
design and construction practices
can l>e implemented in the future,"
(.ohen said.
Neril said he hopes the propos.il
will l>e accepted, foi the benefit of
the entii c Stanford community.
" I Ins is a win-win possibility t<>i
both donors and students." he said.
