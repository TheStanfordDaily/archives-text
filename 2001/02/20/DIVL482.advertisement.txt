experience it It's helpful to know
what to expect at difficult times: it
enables us to help ease others'
pain, or cope with our own. Some
things to be aware of:
■ The first loss may be the most
challenging (with no previous
experience, it can seem like
you'll never recover, but have
confidence that you will)
■ An accidental or unexpected
death can be more difficult to
deal with
■ Grief is heightened by a sense
of isolation (students are
often away from family
members, and don't want to
burden friends)
Normal Responses
There is no set sequence or
predetermined "stages" for grief;
we each go through it in our own
way. A normal response to a
significant loss often seems like
depression:
■ Your motivation may be
down; don't expect to have
100% of your energy or drive
■ You may have less ability to
concentrate; your mind may
wander
■ You may feel vulnerable or
anxious
■ Tears may come at any time
■ You may not sleep well, or
you may sleep too much
■ You may feel numbness,
sadness, or anger
Signs of trouble include:
disruption or stagnation that
persists beyond two months,
thoughts of suicide, and feelings
of self-loathing or profound guilt.
Eventually every path leads to
loss, Umlerstamlin $ ian ease
oar time through it.
Time Heals
It takes most people about a
year after a loss to feel whole
again, yet classes and activities
go on, not waiting for the grief
to pass. This may be especiallv
hard on high achievers, but grief
has its own schedule. Pushing
yourself can backfire. Consider
taking some time off. People
will cut you the slack if you cut
• t for yourself.
What Else Helps
Keep in mind that the pain of
grief is not constant - the
intensity comes and goes. It
may help to think of sorrow as a
wave rolling through you. Even
as you're in it, you know that it
will pass; the pain will not last.
Having closure is important to
the grief process. This is often
achieved through ceremony and
ritual. Gather together with
family and close friends fora
religious ceremony or a simple
get-together - whatever is most
meaningful to you. Consider
starting a ritual and tradition you
might want to continue. Also:
■ Give yourself time to grieve
(feelings of grief aren't easily
"wrapped up" over night)
■ Watch your health: eat well,
exercise regularly, rest often
■ Reduce academic and social
expectations of yourself, and
don't over-commit
■ Have some fun when you can
(remind yourself of what
lifted vour spirits before; do
these things)
■ C ome up with new, do-able
traditions for the first major
holidays
■ Family members are often at
different stages in their grief,
so don't count on great
communication with them
■ Don't be surprised it you feel
like you are "backsliding" a
year or so after a loss (an
" anni versa ry " react ion)
■ Ask yourself repeatedly what
would help ease the pain,
and take steps in that
direction
Don't become isolated. Reach out
to others. You are surrounded by
a community of many caring and
supportive people. Among them:
■ Residence staff
■ Office of Religious Life
(723-1762)
■ CAPS (723-3785)
■ KARA
Volunteer support for those
coping with death or dving
(321-5272)
We cannot escape grief. But we
can take can 1 of ourselves as we
live through it. Q
