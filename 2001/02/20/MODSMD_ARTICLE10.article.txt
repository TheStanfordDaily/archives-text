1987
On Feb. 20, 1987, lhe Daily printed an
editorial about national confusion between
"Stanford University* and "Stamford,
Connecticut."
"We always get confused with that small
town m (Connecticut. Practically the entire
eastern seaboard thinks we re a bedroom

worst offender: when the I niversity set new
records tor collegiate fund raising in the late
'70s, The Titrws buried it on an inside page
with a headline about how "Stamford was

"People in Boston — where I m from —
are ignorant about Stanford, too. When 1
first told people I was planning to attend
Stanford, most evervbod) thought 1 had
made a good < hoice.
" 'Oh, (Connecticut's a nice state,' they'd
say. 'And vou'll be so close to New \ ork
City.'
"Kventuallv 1 got used to all of it. Some

only (Connecticut, just one state over, and
that I'd be home for l liaiiksgiving. Maybe
even before that."
Bottom line: It could be worse. What if there were
a Stamford, Mississippi?
