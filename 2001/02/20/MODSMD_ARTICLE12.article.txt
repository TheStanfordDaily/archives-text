## 
### JOHN SHASANMI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I his tall, Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, in
partnership with Menlo Park's C.arfield Charter
School and Fast Palo Alto's 49ers Academy, a
school designed to provide alternative education
to troubled students, formed an after school men
toring program, funded l>\ a Packard Foundation
grant.
The pilot program matches an adult with one
student. Once a week, after classes, the mentoi
meets the student for about an hour of one-on
one time. Activities range from art projects to
board games to just talking.
"It's about building meaningful friendships be
tween adults and kids," s.iid ()rion Walker, direc -
tor of the program. "By becoming a mentor, you
also become a big brother or big sister, in the non
traditional sense."
He explained that students need this kind ot
support to help them deal with a wide \ ariet\ ot is
sues, or tor the benefit of having someone give
them attention. Michelle Mernane, executive di
rector of the 49ers Acadeinv, agreed.
"Out ultimate goal, for here, is to keep kids in
school, get them back on track so that the\ can be
successful for high school," Mernane said.
Teachers, parents, and communitx members
refer students to the mentor program. Walker
then asks the student it he or she would like to
join.

"Your teacher saws you might be interested in par
ticipating in this Big Brothers Big Sisters pro
gram." Walker says to the prospective mentee.
"I lere's how it works, here's the idea, are you in
terested?"
I Itimately, joining the program is the student's
decision.
Prospective "big brothers" or "big sisters" must
go through a screening process that involves an
interview, reference check and match up with a
student. The process usually takes between two
weeks and a month.
"What we 've done is identified kids that are not
making it in a traditional setting, fora variety of
reasons," Mernane said. "It doesn't have to be )nst
behavioral â€” it could be academic. . . . We try to
provide them with a more indi\ iduali/ed environ
ment."
1 Ins year's goal is to match 25 students in each
ot the pilot program's two schools In the end of
this si hool vear. So tar, live (>atfield students and
four students at the 49ers Academy have mentors.
"We may or ma\ not make [our goal]," Walker
said. "Bui 1 think that definiteh next vear we'll
probably meet that and go bevond."
Mernane was also optimistic.
"1 think it's been great," Mernane said. "1 see
kids with their mentors after school and it's
great to have caring adults to tit into that mold.
1 have .ill these kids now asking me 'c an I get a
mentor toor
A similar mentoring program
previoush existed .it the 49ers
Academy, but the amount of work
and the cliHic ult\ hindered its im
mediate success.
The benefits of the mentor
program is two-told, at cording to
Walker,
"It's just a realh nice environ
ment to be in," lie said. "I go

home .md feel fulfilled because
I'm doing something. I like that.
And I also get a realb interesting
pel spct live into the people's lives
because I get to sit down and do
interviews with them and leai u all
alx>ill who t he\ are.
Mernane decided to involve
the big bi otliei s Hig Sisters pro
gram with the 19ei s A< adenn be
cause of the prestige and success
of the organization.

enrollment is I 10 students, with a

" I lie kids. tliev keep doing

things and you get frustrated be
