"Statistics show that many
more Asian women main out of

'Asian fetish' associated with
Asian women."
Jenkins said that she had
heard about the stereotypes re
garding Asian men and women,
and that there exists a thcoi \ of a
"sexual totem pole," in which
black men and Asian women are
ranked at the top because ot their
s 11 pel-sexuali/eel characteriza

the bottom because of a reverse,
negative characterization.
"So you have a high numtxr ot
Vsian women marrving out. and a l< >t
