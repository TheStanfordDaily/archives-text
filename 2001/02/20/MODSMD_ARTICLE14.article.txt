Tl 11 PARKIN( ■ M l< )KI A( >l\ is no new
problem for Stanford's employees and
students. But this problem took on new
dimensions this veai with the barring of
freshmen cars on campus.
In a recent I >ail\ attic le, I'olue ( liief Man I lar
rington addressed the issue of pat king as a conflict
between University employees and students. Mark
ing and Transportation Services noted that winter
is the most crowded parking time of the year, in
huge part because of the inclement weather. Both
sources asserted that, relative to I (' schools and
non-residential campuses, Stanford's problem is
minuscule.
Still, the parking problem is, undeniably, a
pre >blem.
Hie parking shortage has been evident in sev
eral areas. 1 he first is parking tic kets. Students —
non-freslunen. that is— must buy permits for then
residence parking lot, and only that lot. It a student
