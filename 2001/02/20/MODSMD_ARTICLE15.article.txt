# JUST A BIT OUTSIDE
## Never too early for Draw 
### 
There, above my computer, is .1
slightly curled photograph. It
hangs from the wall menacing
lv, the top right coiner protrud
ing, the poster putty In which it clings he
ginning to fail.
In the photograph, six smiling hoys sin -
round a seventh. Somewhere, beneath

blindfolds and sweatshii is,
a pumpkin and a bike hel
met, that seventJi bov is
smiling too. 1 le should Ik-.
It's his birthdav.
It's one of the few pic -
tures 1 have in which my
smile is natural. Standing
second from the left, it's
evident that 1 could not

be anv happier. I am sin rounded bv some
of im best friends, enjoying the pleasure
of their company, hoping that it is alwavs
going to be like this.
These are my drawinates. (aivs who
grew togetliei during the first months of
their Stanford experience. (Ims who act like
one big. dysfunctional, although extreinch
loving, familv. (.u\s who were given an
identitv around three vears ago ibis time.
1 .ess than three months remain until the
Draw, until those awkward moments w hen
questions of next year's housing make stu
dents choose between friends. Less than
three months until even the most nil
cliquish groups start to act cliquish.
But there are several wavs to look at the
Draw. It does have its benefits. And. as
traumatic as it can be. it can also he a defin
ing moment in the Stanford career.
It was for me.
After just one quarter, my freshman
roommate and I knew we wanted to live
together again. From there, our Draw
group grew. We added the guv across the
hall. A couple boys from upstairs. One
from the adjoining hall.
Some I knew better than others. Fhev
were great people, but it seemed next to
impossible to all be in the same place at the
same time. While we were all friends, we
had trouble bonding as a group.
That is, until we had to register for the
Draw
In order to register, we needed a name.
A name defines a group. (>ne name fora
handful of bovs still learning the ways of
college. Not an easy task. So. our first
Draw group meeting was railed.
Somebody extremely mature, no
doubt, suggested we call our group
"Natesmom. Nathan, our buddy from
across the hall, grimaced.
"Too many letters,"he said with a smile
moments later.
"What about lor?" another cquallv

With that, the Draw group was hoi n.

Stantbrd experience. As a senior. I can
honest 1\ look back on in\ loin wars ai
Stanford and say that the\ would have
been nowhere as special il 1 wasn't a part
of I Mb.
I lie name, as silly as it was, and the
Draw each subsequent year helped keep
oin group together. We weren't pist ,t

had a name. Kvcntuallv, we had match

It doesn't always woi k out that wa\ In
fact, usually n won't. But. as frustrating
as Stanford's Draw max seem, it can also
work wonders to strengthen friendships.
When done right, it (.in help shape the

The thing about our group, though,
the thing about most successful groups of
friends, is that the\ are ever expanding.
People come into our lives and show us fa
