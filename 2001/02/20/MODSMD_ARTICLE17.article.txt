Stanford's land use 'suspicious'
It certainly docs appear to the general
publii tli.it there is more tli.iti meets thi
eve to the tn.ti hin.itions with Stanford re
garding development practices. Altei the
major In nliaha i»| the past several months
over the (General I se IVnnit. many local
citi/ens thought (apparcnth erroneously)
that Stanford's growth into the open space
adjacent to and surrounding the |aspcr
Ridge habitat area would he limited.
Stanford has claimed that then "need"'
lor growth is to cope with the insane hous
ing market in this area. I also have dilli
11lit\ recruiting and relocating personnel
to this area. As a Stanford alumnus, an em
plover of mam Stanlot d graduates and a
host to main voting research interns from
Stanford, I am quite sympathetic to this
issue.
I lowevcr, leasing land toa private insti
tution to build a substantial commercial es
tablishment (the (larnegic Institute, which
w ill be a clearinghouse lor prestigious con
sulting ventures) sti ikes me as largeh un
related to this problem.
It is additionalh suspicious that there is
anecdotal evidence suggesting that

to five years) in the newl\ constructed site,

I stronglv oppose this new develop

housing' 1 hctoric does not matt h its'Yoin

does it show am intent regarding peace

Ethnic theme dorms provide
vital 'learning experiences'
Sabrina Weiner's letter on Feb. 15
("Ftlinic theme dot ids 'undermine con
tributions ol'diversity'") is a perlcct ex
ample of win productive discourse on
the issue of theme dormitories can
never seriously be taken up. Weiner's
sell absorption is so complete that she
can hardly see the weakness oilier own
argument.
She ijiiit kl\ dismisses theme dorms as
simply "tangible symbols ol Stanford's
guilt for not addressing ethnic issues to a
satisfactory extent." Leaving aside the
accuracy ofth.it statement, it obviously
ignores the benefits that theme dorms
provide people who crave the unity and
family atmosphere that a theme dorm
provides.
Having never lived in a theme dorm, 1
cannot take up the arguments of the ben
efits versus the drawbacks, but I do real
ize that because the theme dorms were
set up historically lor the benefit ofcer

lain cthint groups, those people shoulc
propose changes t<> the current system.
It is not ver\ dynamic ami forward
thinking of Weiner to propose (hanging
theme dorms to "academically orientec
ethnic studies dorms." Her reasoning
takes into account the disc omfort ofev
eryone. save the people for whom tin
theme dorms were instituted.
Did she ever pause for .1 moment te
consider win Stanford does not let stu
dents opt out of living in these theme
dormitories.' Mavbe it wouldn't hurt .
freshman to have a learning experience
in college.
ll.ts she ever wondered what it fcl
like to be the onl\ person <>l Asian decen
in your class, the only black person it
your grade or the onh Americ an Indiai
at your school? I guess now she sees a lit
tie of it. It is too bad that not many othei
Stanford students understand the
depths of sue h cultural isolation.
I will not even concede that the prob
Ictus Weiner faced her freshman yeai
had that much to do with the fact tha
I jainaa was .1 theme dorm. She wrote
that .i comment about affirmative actioi
was met with a hostile response from .
resident assistant. That has less to de
with e lic|ue-ishnes> than with .1 pcrsoi
meeting another person with strong so
e ial opinions. Am dorm can be predis
posed te» people like that.

and ac ting as if she "needs a bubble it
