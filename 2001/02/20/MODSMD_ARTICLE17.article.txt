Stanford's land use 'suspicious'
It certainly docs appear to the general

over the (General I se IVnnit. many local
citi/ens thought (apparcnth erroneously)
that Stanford's growth into the open space
adjacent to and surrounding the |aspcr
Ridge habitat area would he limited.
Stanford has claimed that then "need"'
lor growth is to cope with the insane hous
ing market in this area. I also have dilli
11lit\ recruiting and relocating personnel
to this area. As a Stanford alumnus, an em
plover of mam Stanlot d graduates and a
host to main voting research interns from
Stanford, I am quite sympathetic to this
issue.

Ethnic theme dorms provide
vital 'learning experiences'
Sabrina Weiner's letter on Feb. 15
("Ftlinic theme dot ids 'undermine con
tributions ol'diversity'") is a perlcct ex
ample of win productive discourse on
the issue of theme dormitories can
never seriously be taken up. Weiner's
sell absorption is so complete that she
can hardly see the weakness oilier own
argument.
She ijiiit kl\ dismisses theme dorms as
simply "tangible symbols ol Stanford's
guilt for not addressing ethnic issues to a
satisfactory extent." Leaving aside the
accuracy ofth.it statement, it obviously
ignores the benefits that theme dorms
provide people who crave the unity and
family atmosphere that a theme dorm
provides.
Having never lived in a theme dorm, 1
cannot take up the arguments of the ben
efits versus the drawbacks, but I do real
ize that because the theme dorms were
set up historically lor the benefit ofcer

lain cthint groups, those people shoulc
propose changes t<> the current system.
It is not ver\ dynamic ami forward
thinking of Weiner to propose (hanging
theme dorms to "academically orientec
ethnic studies dorms." Her reasoning
takes into account the disc omfort ofev
eryone. save the people for whom tin
theme dorms were instituted.
Did she ever pause for .1 moment te
consider win Stanford does not let stu
dents opt out of living in these theme
dormitories.' Mavbe it wouldn't hurt .
freshman to have a learning experience
in college.
ll.ts she ever wondered what it fcl
like to be the onl\ person <>l Asian decen
in your class, the only black person it
your grade or the onh Americ an Indiai
at your school? I guess now she sees a lit
tie of it. It is too bad that not many othei
Stanford students understand the
depths of sue h cultural isolation.
I will not even concede that the prob
Ictus Weiner faced her freshman yeai
had that much to do with the fact tha
I jainaa was .1 theme dorm. She wrote
that .i comment about affirmative actioi
was met with a hostile response from .
resident assistant. That has less to de
with e lic|ue-ishnes> than with .1 pcrsoi
meeting another person with strong so
e ial opinions. Am dorm can be predis
posed te» people like that.
Instead of retreating into her roon
and ac ting as if she "needs a bubble it
which to acclimate to college life because
she t an*! handle "interaction with other
cultures," she should have done what
Asian Americans. African Americans,
Latino Americans and American Indians
have been doing since thev have been
lucky enough to Ik- allowed the pi i\ ilege
ot attending this glorious universitx ot

Ethnic theme dorms best
solution for promoting diversity
In response to Sabrina Werner's Feb.

1") letter ("Filmic theme dorms 'under
mine contributions of diversityl be
lieve that, m general, the controversy
over ethnit theme tlorms has hccome
convoluted and contusing. In dealing
with this issue. 1 believe that this topic
ought to be divided into two topics,

tlorm lite.

than rat e or ethnit it\. w hit li is addressed
in Weiner's letter. Another cttntlit t is the
ignorant oversiinplitiiation ol ethnit ities
that tails to recognize the diveisit\ within
groups.
l)iversit\ applies lo evervone, in that
eat h pel st»n bet * mies sbapetl b\ his < >i hei
background, heritage and tainih values,
(llearh. this statement in Weiner's letter
illuminates a gotnl tleal ol truth, in that
people ot the same ethnit makeup oi race
» an have \er\ tliverse lives.
In ibis letter, Weinei contradicts hcr
sell when she writes. " I he ethnic theme

dorms undermine (lie contributions from
.iikl integration of the bountiful cultural
cliversitN at Stanford." I'hrough this state
ment. Weinei implies that people who live
in an ethnic theme dorm experience less
diversitx compared to the makeup of the
overall campus.
It has just been established that people
of the same ethnic makeup have just as
much diversitx .is people of different eth
nicities. Obviously, this letter fails to be
consistent in its sentiments.
Weiner proposes to transform the
theme houses into "Ethnic Studies
Dorms.' How will this foster a more cli
verse environment?
Ac (ending to the proposal, students
would elect to live in such a dorm, and the
t esideiue would attr.u t students studying
.1 spec ifit genre of the humanities related
to the theme < >1 the dorm.
However, Ix'cause most of the resi
dents would be studying siniilat subjects,
this proposal would cause the current

ethnic theme dorms to be less diverse.
Diversitx of thought xvould certainly de
crease in comparison to the current eth
nic theme dorms, which house a wide
variety of majors.
As for dorm life, my sympathies lie
with Weinet s traumatizing freshman
year experience. I foxvever. her beliefs do
not reflect the overall feelings of the
freshman residents lix ing in ethnic theme
dorms. Conversely, one also cannot gen
eralize that these same freshmen love
their residences.
lo put this issue into perspective,
generalizing about experiences in any
dorm is a ridiculous practice. C )bx iouslx,
cliques will form in anx and all dormito
ries, regardless of race or ethnicity. But
ethnic theme dormitories liaxe been
scrutinized much more because peo pie
attribute these c liques to the themes of
these houses, natnelv race.
I am a freshman resident of Ujamaa
House and like Weiner, I did not re

quest an ethnic theme dorm. Vet, in
contrast, inx experiences here have
been verx positixe. I he residents in I ja
niaa this year are verx caring, spirited,
good people.
I cannot imagine hxing anvwhere else
because I |amaa is nix second f.unilx.
Weiner was randomlx placed into I ja
inaa, and she did not feel comfortable.
I was also randomlx placed into the
same dorm, and I love it. 1 .ikex\ise, I c ould
have been randomlx plac ed into anothei
dorm and likecl it just .is well, xvhile We in
et could have been plac eel somewhere else
and also tell discontent.
I bis really ought to put the theme
dorm eontroversx to rest, as it becomes
apparent that expel ienc es in these dot ins
are trulx attributed to f.ite. One cannot
generalize about anx thing oi apply Ins in
bet expei ienc es to otliei s.
