tuition for the 2001 -02 year will in

total lost to attend Stanford next

For the fourth year in a row, tu
ition has increased on Valentine's
Dav. According to trustees, this is
to add funding to the I tiiwi Mt\'s
finaix i.il aul program in an effort
to keep the I niversit\ competitive
with othei top-ranked schools in
attracting the hest students in the
country.
According to a recent San Fran
cisco (ihronic le. (lhaii man of the
Hoard of I rustees Isaac Stein said
that the increase in tuition is due lo
the fluctuating economy of the
Hav Area, as well as projected in
i t eases of up to 10 percent in utili
ty hills. Inflation ol local housing
re>sts alsc> pla\ s a lal ge role.
"()ui Silicon \ allev location has
mam advantages, hut the costs ol
operating a large uniwrsit\ here
are, of course, high," Stein said.

"Nevertheless, we remain stead
fast in our commitment to admit
students without regard to their
ahilitN to pav."
I hough some students were ac
cepting of another price hike, oth
ers reacted negativelv.
"I think it's beneficial to attract
kids | who can't allot cI the costs], or
we'd have onl\ people who could
atlord it. said freshman Rvan
l avlor. "At the same time, though,
it's not like it's easy. I'm not on fi
nancial aid, and it simpk poses
more of a hardship for me.
I here are a lot of middle-class
families who are paving 112 ull tuition
because the\ don't (|tialil\ for fi
ll.incial aid. I'hev'll be among the
ones who will t.ike the blow.
"Mv first reaction is I'm glad
I'm a senior, and I'm glad that I'm
graduating, said senior Alexis
kannnskv. "1 can understand
their reasons i! it's financial-aid re
lated, but I'm curious to see exact
ly what other strategies they'll im
plement within the financial-aid
program.
" I'here's a lot of sentiment that

we don't recruit from diverse eco
nomic backgrounds, and I'd like- to
see what they'll do to realU affect
diversitv rather than the superfi
cial diversitv here," Kaminsk\ said.
ASSIJ President Seth Newton
said that lie is aware of students'
concerns, an<j that there has been
much discussion within the ASM .

"The people in the Office of
the Vice President have ongoing
dialogue with the Admissions ()l
fice." Newton said. "We are more
concerned with socioeconomic
diversitv and this institutions
support of it. I think that, while
the I niversity has good pa< kages
for lower-class groups, tuition
hikes don't bode well to increase
that diversitv."
Newton also noted that
meetings with Dean of Admis
sions Robin Mamlet and Vice

Provost for Student Affairs
|ames Montoya had taken
place.
"Dean Mamlet communicated to
us that it was the Board of
I rustees's polio even Kebruan to
raise tuition, but we are verv con
cerned because manv students are
[concerned], and that's the reason
whv we're continuing to pursue
(this issue]."
ASSI \ ii e Piesident Malia Vil
leg.is noted that the ASSI has
taken an interest in the fact that.

while serving as Swart hmore (.< > I -
lege's admissions clean last vear,
Mamlet initiated a recruitment ef
fort based more on .1 socioecc >110111-
ic component.
"Although there's no commit
ment vet, we're talking to Dean
Mamlet about implementing some
of these programs here at Stan
foul," Villegas said. "An example
might be an ambassador program
to help recruit from more rural
areas. I here's a lot of thinking
going on in this area, and hopeful-

I\ there will be some more ideas 011
the horizon."
"As lar as the tuition increase,
there are students 011 the Board
of I rustees committee." Yillegas
said. "We are well represented, so
there's not a whole lot of concern
in that realm."
The "self-help" requirement
of the financial aid program —
which includes part-time work
aiul loans tli.it students must use
during the school year— will also
decrease from $5,500 to ST». I!T>(>.
