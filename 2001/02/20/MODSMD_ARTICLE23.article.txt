In Kuwait, the foreign minister brushed

state-run newspapers. " I hev have the i ighl
to . . . sa\ what the\ want." Sheik Sabah \l
Ahmed Al Sabah told reporters in the Per

I he indirect threat came in yesterday's
edition of Al-Thawra, the newspaper of
Iraq's ruling Haath Party.
"Must Iraq forgive Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait for pat tu ipating in the aggression?"
the paper asked. "Does Iraq have the right

aggression and those who facilitate it . . . if
they continued the aggression and repealed
it?"
I he answer, it said, was left to "Arabs, cs
pecialh those in the (iulf states."
I he Iraqi government is basking in
widespread international support against
the U.S.-British raids — which were the
largest and closest to Baghdad in several
