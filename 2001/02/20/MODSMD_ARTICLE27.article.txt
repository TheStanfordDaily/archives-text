# Cardinal falls to California
## 
### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
With two seconds rem.lining in Ft idav night s game
against Stanford, (California senior (Courtney Johnson
stole the hall and put in a layup for her sixth steal and
34th point of the game.
I hen the Ini/./er sounded, signaling an 82-73 win
for the (>olden Dears and the end of f<flll years of frus
ti ation for Johnson and the other ('al seniors. And as
the celebration began on the floor at Maples Pavilion,
Stanford was forced to confront the sickening realitv
that this "Big Game" was, for once, a huge game, with
N( A A consequences.
"I was just thinking 'Oh my God, it actually hap
pened' ," said Johnson. "1 had been visualizing this
game all week. Every year, we spend so much time
talking about this game, and tins vear we aren't just
talking — we are showing people."
Seldom is the emotion of a contest as visible as it was
at Maples Pavilion on Friday. Flie Cardinal (14-8, 8-4
Pacific 10 Conference) shuffled through the motions
and sat back on its heels, seeming to think that despite
the score, when the game expired it would somehow
be on top.
"We reallv beat ourselves more than anything,"
said junior Lauren St. Clair, who shot a disastrous 2-
foi -10 in the game. "We got a little lackadaisical, and a
little complacent. Ip until this point we really made a
good turn around, and ma\ be that made us a little too
comfortable."
In contrast to the lethargic nature of
the C.artlinal. (-ill's desire to win could
be seen in e\erv pass, steal, shot and re
bound. \<»t onl\ were tlit* (ioltlen Hears
