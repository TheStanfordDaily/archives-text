# WHAT'S WRONG WITH SPORTS
## No cheers for cheerleading 
### RYAN STEWART STAFF COLUMNIST 
p —w much attention nowatla\s is ftmised on
sports liciiK's, great moments and inspira
tional performances. I he media shamclcssh
JL ignores the plethora ot spot is issues that make
us so mad that we wish we could kick 1 )ick Yitale in Ins
constanth running mouth.
Well, no longer. I his column will expose the stu
piditvol the possession arrow. the misuseol the word
"football" In the rest of the world and the travestv ol
the designated hitter. And the fiist terrihh wrong
thing to he exposed here is .i \ iol.ition of sports digni
ty so severe that 1 am sure it has (a used main of you
sleepless nights.
It is terrihh wrong that competitive < lieet leading
actualh qualities as a sport.
1 don't know whoi aine up with the idea to remo\e
cheerleading from the game of football and make it i
spoil unto itself. Ilni it seems to me that when ( heei
leaders stop cheering for their team. thc\ (ease to he
cheerleaders am more.
Alas, for some strange reason, this is not the case. A
growing group of sick, twisted people pack them
selves into gvnmasiums and convention centers in
order to watch a pack of 1 !<-\ear-old girls do flips, veils
and rolls in support of some tmstical sports out it \
whose existence, though seemingh ncccssan foi the
purpose at hand, is sti ikinglv absent.
lo classify this sort of activity as a "sport is to
make a mockerv of the word. Imagine what would
happen if other at unties roinmonh assot iatetl with
sports also decided lo branch oil and bet tune spot ts
of their own.
How about competitive obnoxious parental bet k
lini;? No junior high ft»othall game would he complete
without those few parents who make it their job totlis
ptite even call made In the referee as il tlit' coolness
of tbeii mullet hinged on the outcome ol the game.
Who wouldn't eium spendinu an afternoon .it

(lie old hallpai k wait hing an obnoxious dad throw
used heel cans .it the referee while two obnoxious
moms engage each othet in .1 screaming debate
ovei the relative nieiits ol the sport utilit\ vehicles
used to haul little |mun\ 1 ).u k and forth from soceei
practice.
()i pel haps i otnpetitive lemale ignorance toward
sports. Men. how mam times have vou had to explain
tfie complexities ol the intentional grounding rule to
voui lemale companion .it a football game (I never
have either, but I'm assuming it happens at least oik e
evei \ \ I I game)?
Now imagine that someone made a competition
out ol this. Woman after woman could compete for
the c iown ol le.isi knowledgeable sports lan 011 Earth.
Stadiums would watch, captivated, as these finely
tuned athletes were constantb bombarded with the
moM basic sports c|iiestions.
And how main times have \on wished that
someone would sane Hon .1 (ompctitive field main
tenance league? Spectators would marvel at the
athletic genius of the man who can paint the
straightest lines on the field. Ktid-zone painters
would be c .111 ied out of the stadium 011 the shoul
clci s of thcil peei s .is the judges wave their perfect
10 placards high in the .111.
It vou actuallv took anv of these ideas seriously,
niav (iod have meicv on vour soul. 1 lie preceding
examples were given to prove a point: ('.licetleading.
|ust like heckling. Held preparation and general fe
male apatliv toward sports, is simplv .111 activity asso
ciated with sports, not a sport in and of itself.
So don't look foi me at the next national cheer
leading competition.
()bnoxious Dad and 1 will be throw ing beer c ans
at t lie- end-zone painter and heckling the poor apa
thetic female who just doesn't know or care what is
going 011. I nlikc competitive c licet leading, that's a
real sporting event. And.for those of vou who dis
agree' with anv thing I've s.iicl. vou i c just terribly
wrong.
