Michigan (2-4)a loss in its first gameof the
season and tall\ mg its first win against the

ford because Michigan prematurely
ended the Cardinal's run in the 2000
NCAA tournament.
List weekend, Michigan took a 1-0

lead in the third inning, but the Cardinal
maintained its cool.
"We've been wanting to beat Michigan
since last year, so there was no wav we
were going to be scared when they
scored," junior Robin Walker said. "1
knew we would put some runs on the
board later in the game."
Indeed, theCardinaloflen.se remained
unfa/ed and came roaring back in the
fifth inning. Walker hit a double to left
center, and junior Jessica Mendo/a
walked before junior Sarah Beeson came
up to bat. Beeson doubled to centertield,
allowing Walker and Mendo/a to store
and giving the (Cardinal its 2-1 lead.
lo prove its point, Stanford defeated
Mulligan again, 2-0, roughh 24 hours
later. I he dutch at-bat came in the fourth

inning, when Beeson tin .1 two-run
homer. Michigan had a chance to come
back in the sixth, when it loaded the bases
with only one out. but sophomore pitcher
Jaime Forman-I.au ended the threat with
a groundout and a strikeout.
Stanford's pitching was also key in its I -
0 defeat against New Mexico (3-0) on Fri
day, in which Dana Sorensen's 16 strike
outs beat her own school record of 15.
"Setting .i new personal best is a nice
improvement on mv pitching from last
\eat. and it starts the season off on a good
note," Sorensen said.
Flie sophomore pitcher successfully
shut down New Mexico, striking out the
side tour*times, walking only one batter
and not allowing am runners past first
base.
At bat, sophomore Cassi Brangham
provided the game-winning hit with a
two-out single that drove senior Jenni
Shideler home for the only run of the
game.

Long Beach State (2-5). LeCocq pitched
the first perfect game of hei c areer, end

runners had gotten on base, and mv state
of mind changed. I wanted to keep it
going for rest of the game," I .e( .oc q said.
"But 1 can't take- full < redit for the perfect
game. M\ defense was great and nothing
got by them."
According to juniot |cssica Draemel,
"Softball is a really supei stitious game, so
no one was mentioning that Maureen was
in the /one. She's a realh smart pitc her
and just wasn't giving anyone pitc lies they
could Int.'
