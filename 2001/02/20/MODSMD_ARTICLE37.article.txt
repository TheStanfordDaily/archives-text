On a windy and rainv Saturday after
noon, the Stanford women's lacrosse team
(2-0) demonstrated great poise and heart as

After teammate Noor Dawood sang the
National Anthem, the Cardinal stepped
onto tht- field ready to play.
Stanford jumped to an earh lead when
sophomore Li/ Lanese scored in the first I<>
seconds of plav. Lanese maintained her in
tensitv throughout the game bv intercepting
passes, hustling to ground balls and scoring
two more times in the first hall 'of plav.
"We alwa\ s set goals for ourselves and tr\
to use even game to improve." Lanese said.
"We wanted to have a faster offense, a faster
transition and have better vision. loda\ I
felt like we accomplished our goals.
In addition to its threatening offense, the
Cardinal defense was also strong, holding

the Aggies scoreless in the second halt of the
game.
"We realh are coming together as a
team, s.nd sophomore goalkeepei Rachael
Neumann. "Todav was a huge improve
ment from last week in terms of working to

tone for the game and caused main
turnovers. Stanford's tremendous heart
was apparent in its hustle and effort, despite

weather be a factor because it is raining on
both sides of the ">O." s.iid assistant coat li Li/

suc cess. W'c are taking even opportunity to
improve and using even game to bring our
game up to the next level," said senior Dana
