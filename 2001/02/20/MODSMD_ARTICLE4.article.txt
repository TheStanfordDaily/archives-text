Pifer has held a number of
government positions 111 addition
to the I kraine ambassadorship,
including foreign service appoint
ments in Moscow, London and in
the office for New Independent
States in Washington.
"One of the reasons I entered
foreign service is that von < an t do
most of the stuff that we do in the
private sec tor," Pifer said. "We get
to become very involved in eco
nomic and politic al reform, espe
cialh providing mac roeconomic
advice."
According to Pifer. the U.S.
ambassador to I kraine must per

form four tasks: report back to
Washington on au\ political
crises, represent I .S. views within
the country, give protection to
travelling Americans and find
ways to reform and reshape the
economy and government of
I kraine.
"Right now, we are trying to
find ways to help I kraine mod
ernize." Pifer said. "B\ finding
ways to help I kraine suc c eed, we
can make the whole puzzle of
what Futope will look like in the
future easier to solve."
Pifer said that the I nited
Slates maintains a strategic inter
est in I kraine because of the na
tion's ini 1 itai \ and nuclear
strength.
"We are very concerned todav
about nuclear safety in Cher
nobyl," Pifer said. "Fnhanc ing the
safci\ of conductors that continue
to operate is something that must
be done."
I hough reforms are taking
place in I'kraine, progress has
been slow.
"Progress is not as much as
we'd like to see at this time â€” we
had exaggerated hope," Pifer
said. "Most people have forma
tive interests under the ( om

numisl Ij;i< kground. I he\ do
not yt*t undci si.inrt the in.ii ket
econotm."
In .uldition to discussing
Ukraine's political and economic
climate, I'ifer talked about foreign
service (areers in general.
" The foreign service svstem
lias changed .i lot," Fifci said. "It
used to be ver\ white and ven
male, an image the government
has been trying to chaugc. I wo
thirds ot the people at Foreign
Service (areer Dav were
women."
Applicants lot foreign sen im
positions must pass a competitive
exam in November, an oral .h
scssment and a Neciiiit\ back
ground c heck. ()nl\ pen cut of
applicants pass the exam.
Once selected, I'ilei viicl the
State Department can send a toi
cign servant anvwhere in the
world. 1 lie work is challenging,
interesting and surprising, ac
cording to Filer.
"You'd be surprised at the dif
ferent kinds of trouble people get
into around the world." Filer
said.
Filer graduated from Stanford
with a bachelors degree in eco
