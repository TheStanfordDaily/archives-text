1934
On lib. 21, 1934, l lit' Dailv printed an article
about tlit' Stanford Axe.
" I he Stanford Axe will soon be in a new resting
plat e. After a het tit tareer in now -historical Axe Ral
lies, in the arms of the various fleeing captors who
have captured it from time to time, in armored tars
.ind in mustv bank vaults, the Axe will shortly be
placed in a tropin c .ise in the Stanford I nion (lellar.
" 1 he Axe in its new < .isc w ill be phu e<l across from
the C lellar (igar counter and underneath the carved
.ind initialed table top containing the names of Stan
ford students of former da\ s.
" I he new tropin case is vet to be built. Although
the contract has not vet been let, the Ex Committee
authorized not more than $200 to be used in its con
struction."
Bottom line: The Axe remains a traveling trophy to this day; it
never found a resting place.
