# Court hears marijuana arguments
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AIM
Supreme Court justices joined a
spirited debate vesterda\ over
whether law enforcement offi
cials violated an Oregon man's
constitutional rights when thev
used a heat-sensing device to find
he was growing marijuana in his
home.
At issue is whether narcotics
agents violated a constitutional ban
on unreasonable searches when
thev trained a thermal imaging de
vice on Dannv Lee Kvllo's house —
without a search warrant.
Kvllo's attorney, Kenneth
Letner. said the home should lie a
refuge, where people should be
free to let down their guard with

out tearing the government could
be utireasonabh looking over
their shoulder.
"Win don't youi reasonable ex
pectations of privacv include tec h
nologv? . . . You know there arc
such things as therm.il imagers,"
Justice An ton in Sc alia asked. "Win
do we have to assume we live in a
world without technologv?"
" The burden is really improp
erlv placed on the citi/en to figure
out what tcc hnologv the govern
ment mav come up with, Let ner
replied.
I lie government argues that
law enforcement officials were
within constitutional limitations
when 11 lev utilized the scan, which

sensed heat patterns emanating
from Kvllo's home indicative of
lights used to grow marijuana.
I he\ used the images — along
with a tip from an informant and
electricity records —to obtain a
search warrant of Ins Florence,

that it would be a search." l)eput\
Solicitor General Michael
Dreeben said. "We at e not leal n

But |ustice Stephen Brever
seemed skeptical. He s.iul that
bird watchers carry binoculars
and B<>\ Scouts have flashlights,
which improve human senses,
but "who has a heat thermal de
vice? Nobody, except a few."
