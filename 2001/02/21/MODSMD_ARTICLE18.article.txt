## The 						Stanford Daily University should come clean about Napster

I\ III! LA I F.ST decision to limit bancl
w iclth, the I n i\ c-i sit \ appears to been less
than forthright with the Stanford com
munity. I he timing of the announce
ment («tines iminediateh after the court ruling
making Napster illegal and marks a deviation
from the I niversitv's previous Napster stand.
II the I niversit\ has changed its poliev on
Napster, ii should sa\ sodirectlv.
In the fall, the I niversity dec ided not to ban
N.ipstej because ol Fii st Amendment concerns

would impinge <>n students' freedom of ex
pression. 1 he I niversitx made the right choice
not to polit e students Internet use.
taking the controversial and popular
stance, Stanford stood at the forefront of the
issue, injecting critical and observant First
Amendment arguments into the opinion ket-

tle. And the courts agreed, if only temporarily.
Faculty, students and lawyers alike praised
Stanford's decision to continue allowing stu
dents'access to Napster. The Daily w as among
many who praised the University for giving
students the choice to download songs
through the Internet service.
But hot on the heels of a Feb. 9 court ruling on
Napster, the I niversit\ decided to limit its lcsi
dential bandwidth. The move will restrii t Napster
and Internet-based entertainment use on c ampus.
Last fall, the University had already capped
its network bandwidth todeal with higher traffic
on theethernet server. The original effort aimed
to limit music downloads was a positive step to
ward preserving necessan bandwidth foi aca
demi( use. I he decision also allowed access to
Napster.
After a lower court ruled against Napster in

October, the Ninth Circuit Appeals Court
wrestled with the case on appeal. The trial al
lowed Stanford's decision to stand as a bench
mark on the conflict between intellectual prop
erty rights and privacy.
But now that a new ruling has been issued,
Stanford has decided to limit bandwidth, dis
allowing entertainment traflic to occur (lin
ing high traflic hours. I hough University of
ficials denied that the decision had anything
to do with the Napster ruling, the timing of
the announcement suggests otherwise. I he
decision to limit access represents a refusal to
directly confront the Napster issue.
While we applaud the I niversitv's decision
to restrict bandwidth in order to promote elli
cient academic use, we questions whether
te< lmical limitation is the real cause of restric
tion. Stanford has symbolically complied with

the court's decision and succumbed to music
industry threats to hold the I niversity liable
for students' downloads.
Regardless ol the reasons, the I niversity
should be forthcoming: 11 it is sincere about
protecting students' rights to use the Internet
and its content, it should not speak out of both
sides of its mouth.
Students use the Internet's for school, recre
ation and pleasure. The University's most re
cent decision protects academic Web use but
does not address the Napster question. I hat is
unacceptable. We commend Stanford's earlier
decision because it took a difficult stance in a
controversi.il discussion. Now, w hen it should
be taking the lead, the I niversity has instead
taken the easy wav out and side-stepped the
true issue. It's time to face the fads, own up to
our actions and be honest.
