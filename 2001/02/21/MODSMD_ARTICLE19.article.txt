a woman in one of their sections. Yet
neither student not 1 A normallv shows
even the faintest signs of flirting.
How can we make sense of this
marked inconsistency ? 1 believe it can
be attributed to the nature of Stanford
academics. At Stanford, we treat aca
demics vcrv professionally. Academics
represent our futures as lawyers, doc
tors. diplomats, engineers, congress
men. investment bankers, computer sci
entists and a host of other careers.
These vocations require a high stan
dard of professionalism, and so we
begin our training early.
Kvervone knows that establishing a
relationship with another person at the
same xvorkplac e is not a good idea. Some

work plat i's sti i< il\ forbid fratcrni/ing in
theii office policy guidelines. Whethei
01 not this rule exists on paper, lew
lawvers date othei lawyers in the same
linn. Kqualb rare is a lawvei dating the
new spaper-i 00111 bov.
Of course, one newspaper-room bo\
(an date another newspaper-room girl,
hence the stndent-stndent relationship,
but those occupying the higher rungs of
the hier.n'chv do not date each other,
not do tliev date those occupying lowet
positions.
At Stanford, we feel that this level ol
professionalism must applv to lis as well.
\nd, so, students refrain from consider
ing relationships with I As, and 1 As re
train from considering relationships
with students.
II I might insert a morsel ol reality
here: Stanford is not the workplace, and
we in list not assign to it the same level of
professionalism. We are all young peo
ple with blossoming hormones and a
w bile to wait before we can consider our
selves professionals. So pel haps it would
do us well to |ust get over it.
