Ethnic theme dorms important
to many students
In response to the letter on ethnic
theme dorms ("Ftluiit theme dorms 'un
dermine contributions ol divci sit\l i b.
5), I would like to put down m\ own two
cents. I .1111 .1 ( hic.uio male home-grown
m .i citv th.it was predominantb C.hi
cano Latino. 1 have two oldei brothers
who attended Stanford, and both were
fortunate enough to li\e in ( asa Zapata
their freshman vears. So when it came
time to choose w here to live, I wanted to be
in Zapata. I didn't get in. Instead I was
plated m I janiaa. Now that 1 think about
it. I thank Ckxl I was placed there.
Despite the fact that I was the "other .">0
percent" the minute 1 walked into I ja
niaa, I was welcomed with open arms. 1
had never lived in an environment w here
I could freelv speak mv mind about race,
politics and just lite in general. I do admit
there were times when 1 was the voice of
dissent. However, my opinions were re
spected as I respected the opinions of my
housemates. It is just like every other dor
mitory on campus, but they do go the
extra mile to address the issues facing eth
nic minorities on campus.
I felt that the staff did an excellent job of
creating a healthy environment that al
lowed for open dialogue. The conversa
tions that occurred were rational, and at
the same time, very personal. That only
lead to a stronger and greater under
standing of the world we live in. It is that
personal connection that helps students to
mature, grow and become educated

adults. ()ne can onl\ nedit personal expe
i iences for how one is trub educated. I un
derstand that, as human beings, we opti
mize our learning potential through
hands-on work. What better method of
leai uing i ate relations than In partit ipat
ing in pel sonal. rational dialogues?
Furthermore, 1 believe that ethnic
theme dorms can only do so much. I .asi
vear, w hen I served as a resident .issist.mt
at Zapata, the stall did evervthing in its
power to promote the events and pro
grams we hosted. And, time and time
again, the Stanford community failed us!
W hen was the last time vou went to Club
I j. or Zoot Suit, or Okatla Hvpe, or even
the I'owwofvr
Stanford students must realize that
thev must take it upon themselves to act
community events. We have put on nu
merous programs: dome and get educat
ed! We, the staff of the ethnic theme
dorms, put forth a tremendous effort to
entourage the participation of the entire
Stanford campus at our events. We have
put our hearts and souls into these pro
grams, and it is up to you, the Stanford
community, to support us with your
presence. As a senior, I am proud to say
that I have done the 101 things a Stan
ford senior must do. Mv veins run Cardi
nal Red!
And I am proud to say that 1 have also
attended the beautiful diverse programs
put on by Zapata, L'jamaa, Muwekma-
Tah-Ruk and Okada, as well as various
other multicultural events hosted by stu
dent groups. So if Stanford Magazine
would have put attending Ztxit Suit, Club
I J, I)a Hvpe and the Powwow on the list,

I would have been able to check them off
as well. What about vou, Stanford?

Graduate student questions
apartment prices
I'm quite surprised that the Stanford
West apartments are actually cheaper
than those available to graduate student
couples on campus and through the oil
campus subsidized program. Stanford
West is meant for lacult\. stall, post-docs,
safety officers, among others, but not tor
graduate students. They have 63 spots
available at below market rates which re
quires. tor a single person, that you have
a gross annual income of less than
$48,700 or, fora couple, that vour com
bined income not exceed $35,700.
Fora one-bedroom apartment, the an
nual cost is $9,744 at the below market
rate, and fora two-bedroom apartment,
the rate is $12,036. For on-campus hous
ing tor couples, the rates are 511,496 tor a
one-bedroom apartment and $13,075 for
a two-bedroom apartment. The off-cam
pus apartments are even more expensive.
Most graduate students, as a couple, make
less than $55,700 combined from their
stipends (if they have any at all), so it is not
clear to me why the rates are set higher
than those paid by persons living in the
below-market-rate rooms in Stanford
W'est.
