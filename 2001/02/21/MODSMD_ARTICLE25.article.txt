whizzing .ii (lie back
stop like S< ml missiles.
Allien Belle is threat
ening reporters. Folks in (.Im a
go and Host on are stopping In
the lex al church lot .1 little chat
with the "Big (-u\ upstairs."
It (an onl\ mean one thing.
Spring is here.
1 don't give a d.llllll ii it It.is
rained in Biblical proportions
the last two weeks or whether
I'uxatawnex l'hil saw his shadow
back on Feb. 2. In Arizona and
Florid.i. pitchers and catchers
have repot ted to< amp. Spi ing is
here.
1 here is nothing (|iiite as spe
cial in sports as the start of the
baseball season eat Ii vcai It max
not mean the same thing toda\
that it did in 'Id. but baseball is
still America's pastime.
From tlatls plaving catch with
then sons 111 the bat kvard tt> fans
in local sports bat s cheering on
their teams — win or lose —
baseball is still one of the com
mon denominators in Anient an
socictv.
Fvcrvone has a favorite team
— even that guv sitting next to
vou on the subway, or your
inother-in-law t»r that t ute girl 111
1-Huin section who votive al
wa\s wanted to talk to.
So. as the season kit ks off.
here are tin live fearless predic
tions for the vcar tocotue in base
ball:
Nt>. 5: Boston and I exas will
not wm the World Series, (.heck
that; neither team will even make
the World Series.

Coops, I'm
sot r\ bud. As
mut h as I wish
vour So\ and
niv Rangers
tonltl be tluk
ing it out in
(lame 7 of the
AIXIS ctiinc ()c
-tober, unfoitu

natch', it's just not in the cat ds.
I he reason? <)ne word: pit< h
ing. As everyone knows, hoih
teams stockpiled then lineups
with bats 111 the off-season.
After signing Armani poster
child Alex Rodriguez to .1 con
tract roughb equal to the (.Nl*
of .1 tnedium-siz.cd South Amer
ican country, the Rangers
signed veteran-sluggers Ken
Caminiti and Andres Calarraga
to add to an atrcad\ potent line
up that includes I'lidge Ro
driguez. Rafael Palmeiro. Rnst\
Creer and Reuben Mateo. I lie
onlv squad that is going to hit
more bombs than the Rangei s is
a beer league Softball team in
Sanduskx, < )hio.
And the Red Sox addetl
proven sluggei Maun\ Ramirez,
who has averaged more RBI
than games over the last three
seasons and who will ccrtainK
bolster the middle of the lineup
between Nomar (<ar< iap.ll ra and
Carl Fverett.
Now if onl\ Boston ami I exas
could find a wax for IVtlro Mar
tinez and Rit k Helling to pilch
even other dav, thc\ d be all set.
When it comes to winning in the
crunch, you've to have the
guns, and these one-man rota

lions are not going to rut it. Both
teams will be exciting to watch
and will probahlv contend lot
wild-( .nd spots, hut .1 World Se
ries berth doesn't seem likeh.
No. 1: Denm Neagle won't
last one season in Colorado.
Sine, thev signed him to .i gar
gantuan contract in the oil-sea
son, but b\ thf lime the trading
deadline tolls around, Neagle
w ill be headed back to one ot the
contenders, probablv in the
American league.
I )on t get me w i ong, Neagle is
not a bad pit( her.
I he trouble is. lie's a llv-ball
pitcher, which works line in
( me iniiati ot Atlanta. But in the
Kverest-lbin ait ot Coors Field,
those routine pop-tips and IK
balls that Neagle relies upon to
get outs will be binding 12 rows
deep in the outfield bleachers.
Bv the All-Star break. Neagle
is going to need a \ isit to the c hi
ropractor from whipping his
head around to watch the meat
he serves up get deposited into
the stands.
I he money in (lolorado is
gi eat, but winning is alwa\ s more
important. |ust ask Darvl Kile.
No, I ).i\ id Wells will contin
ue to disprove the inverse pro
portion of lat-grains-to-athlctic
pcrfornianee hvpothesis. Sure,
lie tips the scales at ovei L'.»o
pounds. Sure, he nevei met a Siz
zle! bullet that he didn't like.
Sure, his health habits rival those
of am proud Stanford band
member.
