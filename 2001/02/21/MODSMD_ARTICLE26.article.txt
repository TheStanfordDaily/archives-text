life against Arizona, guiding the
Bruins over the favored Wildcats
with 20 points and 17 rebounds.
Even with his sore ankle.

Gadzuric dominated the heavilv
toutcd frontcourt of Arizona,
causing Arizona coach I aite ()lsoti
to t all him the "most dominant
plaver we've seen all season" after
the game.
