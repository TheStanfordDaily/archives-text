I "lie score was a team record for
C.al, whose season high was previ

lowed the Cardinal to win despite
('.al's si//ling performance.
Head coach Mark ( 00k used
this meet to regroup and to make
some adjustments. Fhe Cardinal
took advantage of its depth by
shuttling the lineup to rest injured
competitors and to give other
gymnasts a valuable opportunit\
to compete.

floor and vault spec ialist, did not
compete in order to rest a sore
back. Freshman and Canadian
Olympian Lise l.eveille skipped
the uneven bars to avoid aggravat
ing a sore shoulder.

handling [the injuries] reallv well,
and it can only help us to give
everyone some experience now,"
said freshman Lindsay Wing.
