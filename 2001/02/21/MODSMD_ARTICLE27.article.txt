Ba\ area gymnastics fans who

were probabh expecting .1 con
viiu ing victon for No. 5 Stanford,

The No. 5 Stanford women's
gymnastics team (M-.'i) edged out
No. 25 California (7-7) 196.95-
196.075.
I "lie score was a team record for
C.al, whose season high was previ
ously 195.75.
Stanford was not trying to set
any records. Instead, consistent
perform.iik es in several events al
lowed the Cardinal to win despite
('.al's si//ling performance.
Head coach Mark ( 00k used
this meet to regroup and to make
some adjustments. Fhe Cardinal
took advantage of its depth by
shuttling the lineup to rest injured
competitors and to give other
gymnasts a valuable opportunit\
to compete.
Freshman Shelley (.oldbcrg, .1
floor and vault spec ialist, did not
compete in order to rest a sore
back. Freshman and Canadian
Olympian Lise l.eveille skipped
the uneven bars to avoid aggravat
ing a sore shoulder.
"I think everyone has been
handling [the injuries] reallv well,
and it can only help us to give
everyone some experience now,"
said freshman Lindsay Wing.
Sophomore Kelsey Stillinger,
who had not \et competed, had
been perfecting a new skill on the
\ault m practice. Her hard work
resulted 111 a 9.N. which helped the
Cardinal take a 0.25 lead halfway
through the meet.
