1 he I niversitx announced its acquisition ot
the S( .1 ()i igin 3800, .i sharecl-ineinoi\ supet -
compute) to be used fbi bioc(imputation.il re
se.u ch and teat hing on I i ida\.
I he computer was unveiled at a press confei -
ence in the (.ates ( »unputer S( iences Building.
Speakers at the conference included Vsmh Med
icine I'rot'. Russ Altinan. directcu ot Stanford's
new ('.enter for Biomedical (Computation, and
Asst. Surgery I'rot". Charles lavlor. chaii of a
committee overseeing the use ot the snpen om
putei and the alloc at ion ot its (< imputing time.
1 lie Origin 3800 is the most recent high
speed processor created In Silicon Oraphics,
I lie. \ccorditig to l avlor. it is the largest com
putet at Stanford, and one ot the largest cotn
putcrs dcdiiated soleh to bio(omputation al
an\ institution. I hough the computet is valued
at S:» million, Silicon (>i .iphii s donated a large
portion ot the costs. 1 'he remaining <ost was
covered b\ the Stanford Bio-\ program, the
schools of Medicine and 1 ngineering and the
Office ot the Dean of Research and Craduate
!'< ilicv.
"We believe that Stanford I niversit\ is
uni(|uelv capable ot making important discov

erics in I >i« h'(imputation because of its history, its
\ isinti and its comprehensive understanding of
how to exploit visuali/.ation technolog\ to en
hance data interpretation." s.tid Bob Bishop,
Silicon (itaphics Chairman and CEO, m the
Stantbrd Repott.
I he new supereomputci will allow Stanford
researchers to complete projects that were im
possible to carrv out in the past.
Specifically, the tasks <>t the supercomputer
nia\ 11 u ludc: simulating the acti\ it its of protein
molecules, analysing how genes are expressed
within cells during development, designing
new molecules for medications, simulating the
results oi patient In pass surgeries to examine
bhkkl litiw .md simulating the motion o! limbs.
" I his is .i tremendous resource to the Stan
ford community engaged in biomedical ((im
putation. I avloi s.iid." 1 his machine is already
being used to solve important problems and
s.inc time."
Although Stanford lias owned powerful
computers in the past, tlie\ have been used In
individual researchers oi as multi-put pose
tools. \((ording to \Hman, this is the first time
Stanford has .u quired a (oniputer to be used In
am Stantbrd fat ultv, stall or students in tliecon
(entrated area of biomedic al computation.
"There are mam problems in biomedical

((imputation that are either too large oi too
time-consuming to be solved with traditional
computers or smaller parallel computet s,'
I avlor said. "Progress in scientific researc li in
main ai eas in biosciences, bioetigineering and
biomcdit ine lecjuii es significant computation
al infrastructure that was previoush lac kii iat
Stanford."
Biocomputational research is becoming an
inc reasingh prominent field ot stud\. and is c\~
pccted to expand well into the next tew dec ades.
"1 am excited that Stanford w ill be a leadei in
this field tor some time to come. Altinan said.
