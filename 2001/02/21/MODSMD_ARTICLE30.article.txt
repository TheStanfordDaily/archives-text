perience was too much lor the relative
ly young No. IS Stanford men s gym
nastics program (1-3) to handle, despite
the Cardinal posting its highest all
around total of the year.
Stanford's efforts came up short, as
the Cal emerged with the victorx and
proved wh\ they are undefeated.
Both teams achieved their highest
point totals of the season, ea< li stri\ ing

" People have been out with injuries and
with sicknesses, and we're |ust now gi t
ting everyone back. We haven't been
doing a lot of routines in prat tit e. ()ver
all, though, I think we're starting to
come together as a team."
Hamada's optimism was reflected 111
solid individual performances that
point toward .1 promising future for the
program.
Sophomore Matt McLean, a strong
vaulter for the team last vear, showed

that he is just as powerful in all six
events In turning in a performance that
won him the all-around title. His store
of 40.500 was a lull three-and-a-half
points above the second-place finish of
43.00, postetl b\ ('al's 2000 All-Aineri
can Michael Ashe.

of the rings. I lis score of 0.250 tied a
meet high and was good enough to se
cure him first place in the event.

saitl. "1 think it was an improvement
from the last meet."

perform well aftei recovering from lus
broken bat k."

with an 8.550.
Cal's squad tins year is a balanced
mix of talent and experience that will
make it a formidable presence at the
NCAA (championships. I he Bears fin
ished first in five of the six individual
events ami swept the top three spots iu
three events.
Despite Cal's dominance, the Cardi
nal's performance coincided with the
training goals that llamada and the

team has set for the season. Although

Cal this vear." llamada said. "They
have a lot of talent. 1 was encouraged,
(ht)ugh. Our all-around store was
about three points higher than last

oui skills."
"Between this meet and the List
meet, vou could tell we're getting clos
er to out no.ils, polishing our skills
and falling less frequently," Krwin
agreed. "We're getting to where we
want to be."
Looking ahead to the upcoming
