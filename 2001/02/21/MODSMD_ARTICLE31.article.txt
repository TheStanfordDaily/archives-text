## Big Brother could be reading your e-mails 
### ABIGAIL PHILLIPS 
Every day, more than 1.4 billion e-mail
messages are exchanged over the Internet.
It's a heftv amount ot material, and that's
\vh\ the Federal Bureau ot Investigation is
so proud ot its new e-mail wiretapping tool,
C.arnivore.
Carnivore was so named because it
can quickly get to the "meat" ot this
morass of e-mail and online messages.
But tor civil liberties groups, it's another
bite ot the meal that a rapacious govern
ment-industry machine is making ot in
dividual privacy.
Carnivore is to e-mail what phone taps
are to telephone conversations. Hie signif
icant difference is that, while a phone tap is
placed on a single phone line. ('.arnivore is
installed on an Interne* Sen ice Provider
network and so has access to the communi
cations ot all members ot the ISP who com
municate over this network — criminal
suspects .jiul bvstanders alike.
()f course, the FBI is quick to note that
the Carnivore svstem will be configured
only to retrieve the e-mail ot .1 particulai
target of investigation, t low-ever, the tear
of both privacy groups and legislators is

that its use will not be thus constrained.
The black box
Carnivore was developed b\ FBI engi
neers in .111 effort to c reate .1 tool that could
accommodate growing demand for Inter
net surveillance in the fate of the more
than 1.4 billion e-mail messages that are ex
changed daily over the Internet. I he sys
tem is a black box, essentially a standard PC
running Microsoft's Windows 2000 oper
ating sy stem, that is designed to work on
ISP networks.
W hen the box is connected to an ISP
network station, Carnivore's software
scans and sorts the bundles of data that
pass through the ISP network. The soft
ware filters out communications to or
from the- target ot investigation and dis
cards the remainder.
According to Donald M. Kerr, director of
the FBl's laboratory division, searches are
limited to an e-mail's sender and recipient
lines; in other words, they don't include sub
ject hi lcs or message content, and Web ac
tivity is only monitored insofar as this in
volves e-mail-like communications such as
Web-based e-mail and instant messaging.
Nonetheless, the software is capable of

screening all elements ot network traffic
including Web brow sing.
Moreover, it is c apable of searching tlu

content of communications, the mere pos
sibility of which is frightening 111 a Big
Brother sort ot way. ()f c ourse. should the
systc-ni run up against an enc ry pted mes
sage. it won't be able to learn much.
Getting the court order
As with any wiretap, the FBI must ob

tain a court order before it can implement
Carnivore to tap the electronic communi
cations of a target of criminal investigation.
While layv enforcement must pass
through a fairly rigorous legal process for
permission to tap a phone, no such spec ific
laws exist (though there are proposals) for
approving yviretaps on Internet-based
communications. As a result, there is some
debate over what rules govern e-mail y\ ire
tapping, and the conclusion inevitably
tends toward weaker regulation.
An investigator yvho seeks to tap a sus
pect's phone must submit to a two-step ap
proval process. First, the investigator needs
approval from a senior Justice Department
official. I hen the investigator must
demonstrate in court that there is proba
ble c ause' that the suspect in question com
mitted or is committing a serious crime as
defined In law. If the judge finds that prob
able cause exists, the judge will likely ap
prove a court order for the tap.
1 lowever. the process is less arduous tor
an investigator who merely yvants to find
out u hat numbers a suspect is dialing from
his phone 01 from what numbers the sus
pect receives calls. In this situation, the in
vestigator only needs to show that such in

formation is pertinent to Ins investigation.
The FBI has argued that use of Carni
vore to record e-mail senders and recipi
ents warrants onl\ such permission as is
necessan under law for intercepting di
aled phone numbers. And. indeed, the
trend so far has been to assume that the
more demanding requirements for phone
taps do not appl\ to e-mail wiretaps.
ISP compliance
Most Internet Service Providers have
been cooperative with requests to install e
mail wiretaps, according to the FBl's Cyber
Fcchnologv Section. However, there have
been a few notable exceptions. When
Farthlink. a popul.tr national ISI *. received
a court order in Dec., 1999. requiring use
of aw iretapping device to record commu
nications from a particular account, the
compam balked.
Instead. Farthlitik ottered to use its own
svstems to supph the government with the
information in question. 1 hough the gov
ernment initialh agreed to the compro
mise. i! later issued a second court order
compelling I arthlink to allow law enforce-

Every day, more than 1.4 billion e-mail
messages are exchanged over the Internet.
It's a heftv amount ot material, and that's
\vh\ the Federal Bureau ot Investigation is
so proud ot its new e-mail wiretapping tool,
C.arnivore.
Carnivore was so named because it
can quickly get to the "meat" ot this
morass of e-mail and online messages.
But tor civil liberties groups, it's another
bite ot the meal that a rapacious govern
ment-industry machine is making ot in
dividual privacy.
Carnivore is to e-mail what phone taps
are to telephone conversations. Hie signif
icant difference is that, while a phone tap is
placed on a single phone line. ('.arnivore is
installed on an Interne* Sen ice Provider
network and so has access to the communi
cations ot all members ot the ISP who com
municate over this network — criminal
suspects .jiul bvstanders alike.
()f course, the FBI is quick to note that
the Carnivore svstem will be configured
only to retrieve the e-mail ot .1 particulai
target of investigation, t low-ever, the tear
of both privacy groups and legislators is

that its use will not be thus constrained.
The black box
Carnivore was developed b\ FBI engi
neers in .111 effort to c reate .1 tool that could
accommodate growing demand for Inter
net surveillance in the fate of the more
than 1.4 billion e-mail messages that are ex
changed daily over the Internet. I he sys
tem is a black box, essentially a standard PC
running Microsoft's Windows 2000 oper
ating sy stem, that is designed to work on
ISP networks.
W hen the box is connected to an ISP
network station, Carnivore's software
scans and sorts the bundles of data that
pass through the ISP network. The soft
ware filters out communications to or
from the- target ot investigation and dis
cards the remainder.
According to Donald M. Kerr, director of
the FBl's laboratory division, searches are
limited to an e-mail's sender and recipient
lines; in other words, they don't include sub
ject hi lcs or message content, and Web ac
tivity is only monitored insofar as this in
volves e-mail-like communications such as
Web-based e-mail and instant messaging.
Nonetheless, the software is capable of

screening all elements ot network traffic
including Web brow sing.
Moreover, it is c apable of searching tlu

content of communications, the mere pos
sibility of which is frightening 111 a Big
Brother sort ot way. ()f c ourse. should the
systc-ni run up against an enc ry pted mes
sage. it won't be able to learn much.
Getting the court order
As with any wiretap, the FBI must ob

tain a court order before it can implement
Carnivore to tap the electronic communi
cations of a target of criminal investigation.
While layv enforcement must pass
through a fairly rigorous legal process for
permission to tap a phone, no such spec ific
laws exist (though there are proposals) for
approving yviretaps on Internet-based
communications. As a result, there is some
debate over what rules govern e-mail y\ ire
tapping, and the conclusion inevitably
tends toward weaker regulation.
An investigator yvho seeks to tap a sus
pect's phone must submit to a two-step ap
proval process. First, the investigator needs
approval from a senior Justice Department
official. I hen the investigator must
demonstrate in court that there is proba
ble c ause' that the suspect in question com
mitted or is committing a serious crime as
defined In law. If the judge finds that prob
able cause exists, the judge will likely ap
prove a court order for the tap.
1 lowever. the process is less arduous tor
an investigator who merely yvants to find
out u hat numbers a suspect is dialing from
his phone 01 from what numbers the sus
pect receives calls. In this situation, the in
vestigator only needs to show that such in

formation is pertinent to Ins investigation.
The FBI has argued that use of Carni
vore to record e-mail senders and recipi
ents warrants onl\ such permission as is
necessan under law for intercepting di
aled phone numbers. And. indeed, the
trend so far has been to assume that the
more demanding requirements for phone
taps do not appl\ to e-mail wiretaps.
ISP compliance
Most Internet Service Providers have
been cooperative with requests to install e
mail wiretaps, according to the FBl's Cyber
Fcchnologv Section. However, there have
been a few notable exceptions. When
