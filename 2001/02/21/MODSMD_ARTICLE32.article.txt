Dot-com refugees are returning to
campus as the econonn seems to be slow
ing clown, but main students are still
dreaming of high-tec h business succ ess.
1 he Stanford Kntrepreneurs ( hallenge,
the annual business plan competition
conducted b\ the Business Association of
Stanford Kngineering Students, has seen
a drop in the number of entrants this
year, as well as a diversification of tin
types of ideas presented.
While last year main would-be Intel
net tycoons entered e-commerce ideas
into the competition, business ideas
based on real technology dominate the
pool of entries this year. Willi the in
crease in business plans fbi advanced
software, hardware, biotech and other

tec luiic all\ sophisticated ventures, the
nunibei of graduate students participat
ing in the K-( lhallenge lias increased.
Some non-tec hnic al majors are also par
ticipating in the ( onipetition.
"It's a lot less teams, and it's a reflec
tion of the wa\ the ec onoim is changing
in a fundamental wav. said Josh Bartel,
vice-president of the l\-( hallenge. "It's a
mill h more diversified field of entr\. 1 he
venture capitalists are going to be happ\
this \ear because there were a little too
main dot-coins last year, stuff the\ could
get awa\ wit h in last veai's ec ononn . I his
year, they're looking foi a little more on
the haidw.ue side.
