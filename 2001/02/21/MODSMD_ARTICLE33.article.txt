The arc-like pattern spread across the picture like a spicier web is an illusion caused by the gravitational field of a cluster of galaxies called Abell
2218. This process - called gravitational lensing - magnifies, riqhtens and distorts images of objects that lie far beyond the cluster, providing a
powerful "zoom lens" for viewing galaxies that are so Far away that they could not normally be observed. (Courtesy of NASA and STScI)
