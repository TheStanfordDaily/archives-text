plane's engines and passed
through two Ik.it exchangers,

the othei in the fuselage.
1 lu- ext liangei in the fuselage
uses liijnid livdrogen to cool the
owgen, which is centrifiiged to
remove the litjiiid oxygen. Once
the plane collects .'VIO tons ot lit j-

uit 1 owgen, the carrier planes
engines are turned off and the
rocket engine is used to propel
the plane and shuttle.
