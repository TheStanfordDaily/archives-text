\: W ltoa, there; take .1 deep bieath.
First off, let Answci (.111 explain what
sleep means pin siologit allv.
Sleep is made up of two vet \ tliflei ent
behavioral states: rapid eve movement,
ot RFM, sleep and non-RF.M sleep, on
start In entering Stage ()ne, a light sleep.
Yoni must les rela\. and viun brainwaves
switch irregularlv and rapitllv (fbi those
who pretet tccluiital descriptions. these
are theta waves).
In Stage 1 wo, brain waves become
larger, with bursts ol electrical activit\
(sleep spindles and K complexes). I hen
von move into deep sleep. Stages I luce
and Four. 111 which the brain produces
large, slow waves (delta 01 slow-wave
sleep). When you're in these las' two
stages ol non-RF.M sleep, it's very dillic tilt
to wake sou up.
After about an hour, vou into
RIM sleep, a surprisingh active stage dis
tinguished bv rapid eve movement
(hence the name). In fad. the individual
nerve cells are so active that vour brain
waves are comparable to that of vour
waking state. I his signals vour arrival at
the world of dreams — litcralb. I he high
level ot neuronal at t i\it \ (an be explained
bv the fact that the brain is not onlv taking
in stimuli but also generating the ver\
stimuli it perceives.
Vou spend about 25 percent of vout
sleep time in this REM state, and the rest
of the 75 percent of vour night is spent in
non-RFM sleep. RFM periods tend to
occur more frequently and last longer as
the night progresses.
Fortunately for your roommate,
you're effectively pat ah /ed dut ing RFM

so that vou'i e not acting out vout dreams.
()| cotuse, this is undci normal c iix 11111-
stances. FOl all \<>u sleepwalkers, that's
another topic foi Answei (»irl to address
in the future.

Wording to Dr. William Dement,
professor of psychiatry, the dreaming
vou experience chn ing RFM sleep is your
brain's (1 cation of its own pel sonal world
.ind living in it. I he dream world is very
real w bile you're t bet e. As a matter ot fact,
the onlv difference 111 consciousness be
tween the wake state and RFM sleep is
tli.it the dream-state isn't constrained In
senson input from the physical wor^l.
In other words, the images that vou
see 111 the awakened state are those creat
ed in response to stimuli. File images that
vou see in vour dreams are the same
products ot' item al at ti\ it\. but the brain
< 1 can s the stimuli.
I he link between RFM sleep and
dreaming is, .is Dement analogized, like
eating. When vou eat. vou taste vour
food, but tasting doesn't have a physical
benefit.
1 litis, dreaming docs not have a de
terminable physical benefit. But it is 1111-
portant to realize that dreaming and
RFM are the const ions ami pin sical sides
of the same coin.
in dreaming, you are usualU a passive
player. That means vou don't make deci
sions, and vou don't know what is going
to happen next. In fact, it's very much
like being at the movies — onlv vou rein
the tno\ ie. Also, tlreams are t\ pit allv not
1 eflet tive.
I hat explains why you accept the
strangest things 111 vout dreams. Dement
offered an example 111 whit h vour room
mate suddenly turns into a grape. In ac
tive, conscious reality, you certainly
would notice and become alarmed. In
voin dreams, however, vou would accept

tins strange occurrence.
Dement suggested a possible explana
tion: "So much energ\ and effort is re
quired ol the brain to create a whole
world with no senson input that verv lit
tle brain is leli to reflect [judgement]."
1 bis is analogous topla\ ing a demanding
game that commands votn lull attention:
Vmi h.ive verv little capacity for other
considerations.
Most importantly, however, is De
ments assertion that nobody knows why
people dream what thev dream, and no
bod \ realh knows what dreams mean.
Main sleep "experts" have.theories that
the\ base on c onunonh observed associa
tions, but thev are extremelv difficult to
pare down and prove scientifically. Com
mon themes — such as flying, taking
tests, being naked in public. teeth falling
out and running awa\ — have ven indi
\ idu.il meanings.
For example, according to Sigmund
Freud, living has sexual indications (but,
then again, so did a great mail) other
things tor Freud). But other dream ana-
Ksts connect living to power. So Dement
suggests that vou fiee-asscx iate vsith vour
dreams: Co through and relate the com
ponents of the dreams to the rest of the
dream. Then deduce from the context.
I nfortunatelv, no one can tell vou exact-
Iv what vour dream means for you. I ven
Answer Cirl can't help.
As for the connection between vour
burger and the nightmare. Dement states
there are very few factors th.it can cause
vou to have more RIM sleep (and, there
lore, dreaming).
I here is one phenomenon that can
cause vou to have more RKM sleep: sleep
deprivation. Sleep deprivation causes
RKM sleep to double up. and this intensi
t\ is linked to the intense nature of night
mates. I he conclusion, then, is that you
shouldn't deprive yourself of too much
sleep it you want to decrease your ( bailees

I here is one phenomenon that can

\: W ltoa, there; take .1 deep bieath.
First off, let Answci (.111 explain what
sleep means pin siologit allv.
Sleep is made up of two vet \ tliflei ent
behavioral states: rapid eve movement,
ot RFM, sleep and non-RF.M sleep, on
start In entering Stage ()ne, a light sleep.
Yoni must les rela\. and viun brainwaves
switch irregularlv and rapitllv (fbi those
who pretet tccluiital descriptions. these
are theta waves).
In Stage 1 wo, brain waves become
larger, with bursts ol electrical activit\
(sleep spindles and K complexes). I hen
von move into deep sleep. Stages I luce
and Four. 111 which the brain produces
large, slow waves (delta 01 slow-wave
sleep). When you're in these las' two
stages ol non-RF.M sleep, it's very dillic tilt
to wake sou up.
After about an hour, vou into
RIM sleep, a surprisingh active stage dis
tinguished bv rapid eve movement
(hence the name). In fad. the individual
nerve cells are so active that vour brain
waves are comparable to that of vour
waking state. I his signals vour arrival at
the world of dreams — litcralb. I he high
level ot neuronal at t i\it \ (an be explained
bv the fact that the brain is not onlv taking
in stimuli but also generating the ver\
stimuli it perceives.
Vou spend about 25 percent of vout
sleep time in this REM state, and the rest
of the 75 percent of vour night is spent in
non-RFM sleep. RFM periods tend to
occur more frequently and last longer as
the night progresses.
Fortunately for your roommate,
you're effectively pat ah /ed dut ing RFM

so that vou'i e not acting out vout dreams.
()| cotuse, this is undci normal c iix 11111-
stances. FOl all \<>u sleepwalkers, that's
another topic foi Answei (»irl to address
in the future.

Wording to Dr. William Dement,
professor of psychiatry, the dreaming
vou experience chn ing RFM sleep is your
brain's (1 cation of its own pel sonal world
.ind living in it. I he dream world is very
real w bile you're t bet e. As a matter ot fact,
the onlv difference 111 consciousness be
tween the wake state and RFM sleep is
tli.it the dream-state isn't constrained In
senson input from the physical wor^l.
In other words, the images that vou
see 111 the awakened state are those creat
ed in response to stimuli. File images that
vou see in vour dreams are the same
products ot' item al at ti\ it\. but the brain
< 1 can s the stimuli.
I he link between RFM sleep and
dreaming is, .is Dement analogized, like
eating. When vou eat. vou taste vour
food, but tasting doesn't have a physical
benefit.
1 litis, dreaming docs not have a de
terminable physical benefit. But it is 1111-
portant to realize that dreaming and
RFM are the const ions ami pin sical sides
of the same coin.
in dreaming, you are usualU a passive
player. That means vou don't make deci
sions, and vou don't know what is going
to happen next. In fact, it's very much
like being at the movies — onlv vou rein
the tno\ ie. Also, tlreams are t\ pit allv not
1 eflet tive.
I hat explains why you accept the
strangest things 111 vout dreams. Dement
offered an example 111 whit h vour room
mate suddenly turns into a grape. In ac
tive, conscious reality, you certainly
would notice and become alarmed. In
voin dreams, however, vou would accept

tins strange occurrence.
Dement suggested a possible explana
tion: "So much energ\ and effort is re
quired ol the brain to create a whole
world with no senson input that verv lit
tle brain is leli to reflect [judgement]."
