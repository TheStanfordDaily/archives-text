# Study may help dyslexics
## Stanford researcher shed light on disease in children 
### BEN FRIEDLAND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
()u Feb. 12, researchers at
Stanford, led In graduate stu
dent F.lise Temple, published the
first siiub on child d\ slexia as e\-
aniined b\ brain imagerv. I he
stud\ discovered that dvslexic
children process the sounds of
language dillerenth from chil
dren without the disease.
"Dvslexic s have a hard time with
phonologic al awareness, the sound
structure of words," said lemple.
"For example, rhvtncs. pig l-atin
and syllable counting are .ill ditfi
c ult lot people with d\slexia."
l emple defines the disease as
"characterized bv difficulty in
reading despite the motivation,
instruction, intelligence and sen
son abilities required lot ade
quate reading." I lu- popular be
lief that d\slexia is related to the
flipping of words and letters is
false, l emple said.
I lie stuck used functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging to

monitor children's hi.llll activit\
while reading, l emple tested 21
children with dyslexia and l.">
others with normal reading lev
els, all between the ages of eight
and 12. I lie children looked at
two letters, like Band I), and told
Temple whether the two letters
rhvmed.
"We would look at the brain
activity while kids are rhvming."
l emple said. " I he hypothesis
was that we would see changes
even with this simple reading
component."
Asthestuch explains. Temple's
h\ pothesis proved correct.
" 1 he brain has two language
regions." 1 emple said. " I he kids
who read normalh hadactivit\ 111
both regions, whereas the dyslex
ic kicls only had ac tivity in one."
John Cabrieli, associate profes
sor of psychology and the study's
supervising facultx member, ex
plained that the stuck shows that
"we can stuch specific brain pat
terns in c hildren and then diag
nose dyslexia."
While l emple acknowledged
that the study was onlv a begin
ning and that it needs more
work, she said that the ability to
diagnose d\slexia is extremeh
