An earthquake with .1 magnitude of 7.0
on the l\i( htci Si ale rot ked the small ( Cen

In the past month, over 1,000 aftershot ks
have hit El Salvador, itu hiding one that mea
sured ().("> on the Ri< liter St ale last I uestlax.
()wr 1.000 people haw tlictl, approximate
ly 1011,000 people have been tlisplacetl from
their homes, and billions of dollars of nation
al infrastructure have been destroved, 111-
(lutling 1.200 st liools and eight Ik>spitals, ac
cording to ret cut news reports.
It ni.iN seem that students at Stanford t an
do little to help the lives of the Ml Salvadori
.ins, who liw thousands of miles to the
south, but such is not the case. ()vcr the past
month, a large group of students has raised
campus awareness about the quake and
gathered tnonev and supplies to help re
lieve the damage.
Mark Kisner, a master's student in I .atin
Amerit an Studies and the head of the ('.en
ter for l.atin American Studies' C'.entral
America Working (.roup at Stanford, t <x>r
dinated this student response effort.
Kisner saitl that the pre\ions political in
justices 111 I'.l Salvador, including the I I Mo
/ote massacre and the killing of |esuit
priests, had always caused him to feel em
pathy for the* citi/ens of the countn .

"Here I was sitting in a human rights
c lass, getting teary eved hearing about the
death of several Jesuit priests,'' Kisnei said.
"Then this happens, and vou're strut k with
the feeling of'disbeliefand that there's noth
ing vou can do."
"But there was something we < ould do,"
Kisner continued. "When the earthquake
happened, [as head of the C entral \ineri
can Working Cuoupl I was in a position to
take the lead on this.
I wo weeks ago, Kisner pointed to the
political corruption ol the ruling part\ as a
major reason whv the vie tints ol the Kl Sal
vador earthquake need outside assistance.
I lie ruling right-wing ARKNA part\ has
withheld binding from the areas hit hard
est b\ the quake. which are strongholds of
the opposition l-MKN partv. according to
Kisner.
Kisner has been working with a numhei
of grass roots non-government organi/a
tions in order to send < ollet lions of mone\
and othei goods to the quake vi< tints in Kl
Salvador.
In ordet to raise awareness on these op
port unities to help with the earthquake re
