Latino, 100 pert cut American Indian 01
1 00 pen ent \siaii. I doubt that most ol us
would have t onie.
Stanford s admissions department
makes .111 eflort to c reate a student both
with a good mix of pei»ple ol all colors, and
that's something we found attrac live about
Stanford when we were deciding where to
go.

I lie niajoritv of us

We believe that tlil-

Right?
I hal depends on what \<m consider lo

think so.
Walk around campus and look toi .1

he the ultimate goal ol ha\ing a diverse
student botlv. Ask ,m\one who has
thought sei ionsh ahoul 1 he pin pose ol di
versity, and the answet is likel\ to locus on
learning about racial and ethnit hack
grounds othet ill.in vout own. I>ut is this
learning actualh taking place? I don't
think so.
Walk around campus and look toi .1
group ol students so interr.lci.ll that \ou
could lake a pit lure ol them and print it in
a Stanford hux luire. N ou'll have a tough
time finding one.
( onsidci this: While at Stanford, you
will live with a wider < l oss set lion of the
rat 1.11 spet 1111111 than \oii will lot the test ol
\oiii lile. You have a unit|iie. tout -vcai op

Residential segregation m the real
world —. outside ol college — is rampant.
I II bet that the communis vtni tame from
was lull t»f people who were the same color
as you. And the same will prohahh be true
of the place that \ou will li\e long after
vou ve gratluatetl from Stanford.
Yeats from now. vou can boast to vour
niontH hroinatit neighbors about the tli
\etsii\ vou encountered 111 college, but il
\oii never even liothercd to learn the name
t>f that brown-skinned gu\ vou had cheni
isti \ set tion with, then what was the point?

I torn what I tan tell, we have a prett\
left-leaning student bod\ heie at Stanford,
so I atti ibute the fact that we value rat 1.11
cliveisit\ pa 111 \ to ideological liberalism.
We're here foi .1 libel alec inc.it ion in the
fullt'si sense, both inside and outside 1 »1 the
classroom. I lie trouble is that it's a lot
hartlei tt» be a good liberal than it is to be
a good consei vative. lobe a gt>t>t 11 onset -
vative. vou cloii't have to do nine h. but to
be a good liberal, vou have to wot k prctt\
damn haul to make even the slightest dif
ference 111 the world.
I )ivci sit \ is just like that. It's eas\ to con
tinue reciting the st.itistit s 011 Stanford's
student both and convince vourself that
we're doing a great job <>1 learning about
people of all backgrounds. ()n the other
hand, vou could strive to at liieve niore, so
that "diversit\" becomes something lived,
instead «>i just a bunt li of numbers 111 a
brochure.
I'd like to give vou the impression that
it's cas\ to go out there and make friends
with people who vou've never encoun
teretl befoie, but it isn't. It takes a little bit
t)l eflort and a lot of guts. You have to de
cide foi vourself whether stepping out of
voui comfort /one is worth the pavofl. I
guarantee vou that 11 is.
