Students opposing theme dorms
just don't get it'
As I read Sabrina Werner's response to
the Feb. ."> article 011 ethnic theme dorms
("Filmic theme dorms 'undermine contri
butions ol divei sit\' "), I lound im jaw
dropping in disbelief. I think that all the
opinions she presented against ethnic
theme dorms are prcciseh the issties that
necessitate then existence, and the\ prove
that she. along with students opposing sue h
dot ins, just doesn't get it.
Let me st.ni In saving that the purpose
ol these theme dorms has nothing to do
with "Stanford's pride." and everything to
do with the partic ul.u ethnic group's "cul
tural pride." l>o vou realU think Stanford
magicalh said one dav. "OK. let's build
themcdorins lot minorit\ students to ac t as
.in oasis in the cultural shock desert that
Stanford I niversitx represents tor them"?
I don't know about the test of the theme
dormitories, but it took the assassination of
Dr. Martin I.uther King Jr.. as well as nu
merous protests and demands In the Black
Student I Dion, for the I niversit\ to even
contemplate the c reation of the dormitory
that African-American students, and .ill of
Stanford, now affectionately call "l j." I'm
pretty sure that the rest of the theme clonus
didn't materialize from the kindness of
Stanford's heart either, though I'm not fac
tually familiar with the history of all of
them.
As for the statement that people of these
"particular ethnicities are weak and need a

bubble in whic li to ace Innate to college lite
because ilie\ (an t handle interactions with
othet cultures.'' I couldn't disagree more.
Mem lupp\ would Weiner be if slu- were
forced to live in I jani.i.i for .ill tour \c.n M>f
\oui Stanford education?
B\ Weinei s own admission, she could
hardh handle tlu- fit st two weeks, let alone
font vc.u s. Well, that is what life w.is like- tot
minorit\ students in this I niversit\ before
the inception of the ethnic theme dorms
and how it is for the most pan toelav. Flic
difference is that, because we have to deal
with this t\pc of culture sho< k everywhere
else- we go. we c annot onl\ handle it bettet
than Weiner did. it is second nature for
most of us.
Weiner talks about how slu- spent most
of her time awa\ from the donnitorv in
order to alleviate the discomfort she felt,
but. if there were no theme dormitories,
w here would a black student go tor a hi eatli
of familiar ait ?
It seems to me that the ones w ho are un
able to deal with unfamiliar c ultural inter
actions are people like Weiner. who. at the
first hint of discomfort, opt to oust them
selves from a situation instead of facing it
head on and trving to learn from it. Now I
know that, as a freshman, coming into I ja
tnaa might be a daunting task, but it is no
more daunting than it is fora black fresh
man to live in Branner.
Why then, should the white freshman
Ik- able to choose to live somewhere else if
they draw into I j? Furthermore, why
should they remain "anonymous," as

Wcincr suggests? Might n Ik- that they
would prefet anonvmit\ so that folks won't
think the\ .lie "afraid" of blacks due to
then prejudices and stereotypes, or be
cause the\ couldn't handle the interaction
with a pat tic ulai ethnic itv?
Ihe idea is foi students to face these
c hallenges .md overcome I licit precon
(eived notions of a particular ethnicity, and
make the best out «>| a situation that might
seem cliflic ult, which is in ic.iiit\ onlv asdif
lii ult as von make it tot yourself. As a black
student. I had to live in Serra nn freshman
vcat. I hat was not nee cssanlv roses tor me
either, but I spent time with inv donn
niates. and. to this da\. I do things with
them on occasion.
I considei the experience to have been
hard but benefit i.il because 1 didn't witli
di •aw from tn\ dormitorv and escape. In
stead. I chose to sta\. explore and in.ike
friends. I here is a C.aucasian classmate of
Weinet s who has not onl\ lived in I jamaa
all his font \eat s. but has managed to have
some of the most entertaining theme pro
posals in the dorm ever) vear and has be
come an integral part of it! ('.ranted, th.tt is
an exceptional case, but if we can get one
non-ethnic person a year to learn as much
.is this gentleman has learned about .moth
er culture, then the ethnic theme dormito
ries are serving their second purpose,
which is to educate the non-ethnic half of
the dorm on what it is like to lx- a minority.
1 know, and I'm pretty sure that Stan
ton I knows, ih.it it .ill freshmen were given
the choice to Ik- reassigned aftet Iking
placed in .1 theme dormitorv, the majoritx
would move out. Ili.it is preciseh wh\ ran
dom placement of 11 < »s|> is .m asset and not
.i liahilit\. I he fact is that medicine doesn't
alw .i\s taste g<hkl, hut its .11 w.i\ s good toi
vou, and the people who would complain
the m<>st ,iie the«mcs who need tlu- expel i
ence the most.
Now I'm not saving in an\ u.i\. shape ot
form that Weinei is racist, hut 1 am saving
that she squandet ed .i beautiful i ham e to see
the world through someone else's e\es. I hat
is .i choice that, .is ininoi Hies. we .ire ne\ei .it
folded because, no niattei what the percent
age of black students is in Ujamaa, or how
many Latinos are in Casa Zapata, we still
have to go to our ptedotninanth white c lass
es taught b\ out predoininantK white tacul
t\'.governed I>\ oui predoininantK whitead
ininistration. I argue that Weinei s frcsli
nian dorm didn't alienate her. hut that slu
alienated herself from hei freshman dorm.

<>N.i final note. I think that Werner's
opinions are svmptomatic of a verv
widespread attitude towards integration
and niultic ulturalisin in this couiiiia. 1 hat
attitude suggests that the battle to achieve
racial and ethnic harmom should be waged
in siu 11 a wa\ as to have tlu- minorities move
toward wh.it the ( aucasian majoritv con
siders the- norm. 1 contend that the majoi i
t\ lias to meet the minorities in a middle
ground, anil that ethnic iheme dot ins are a
step in the iiglit dim tion.

Political injustices in El Salvador
'exacerbate current disasters'
I greath apprec i.ite vour ai tide on stu
dents' it forts and mot i\ at it »ns to help alle\ i
ate the suffe rings caused h\ the- tragedies of
the KI S.iK.ulorian earthquakes ("Helping
the \ i( tims." Feb. 'J I).
I lowevei. though I do not w.mt to de
einphasi/e the definite political injustices
that have exacerbated the disaster, which
cannot be overlooked noi remain unad
dressed. the inherent and essential drive

behind our at lions lias been humanitarian
and non politic al. Millions of people are suf
fering. regardless ot politics, and. tint* to
oui privileges as Stanford students, we tan
and must help.
I'owarcls this, while Patrick (Irosetto
wrote that "tin- previous political injustices
in Kl Salv.iclc >1. Nic hiding the K1 Mozote mas
sac 1 c and the killing ot Jesuit priests, had al
wa\sc aused |me] to feelempathy for thee it
i/ensof the country." 1 hope it is understcxxl
that in\ emotion — our emotion — derives
not just from these horrific injustices but of
course from so main fac tors: personal and
historical, hut most essentially, something
c idled oui common humanity.
1 would also like lo make it clear for the
i crc>i d that the ( eiitral \nieric an Working

oi ac tions associated with its members are
not necessariK those of the group itself.
Again, I thank vou for spreading the
word on the situation and how people can
help. 1 urge anyone wanting more infor
