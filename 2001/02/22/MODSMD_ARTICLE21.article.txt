It would make Nfike* Mont
gomery cringe to hear \ou sa\ it,
hut this weekend could apth be
described as the calm before the
storm lot the Stanford basketball
team.
Sure, the l\u 11u 10 (.onlei em e
is a tough league, and, \es. any
thing can happen in college bas
ketball— witness former No. I
North Carolina's shot king loss to
last-place Clemson last Sundax
but this is Stanford we're talking
about here, a team that thrives on
consistent \ and steadiness and
doesn't bring am sm prises to the
court.
So Washington State will come
into Maples Pavilion tonight, fol
lowed b\ Washington on Satur
day, as most Cardinal finis are al
ready looking ahead to the next
week, when a potentially danger
ous trip to Los Angeles awaits the
nation s No. I team, but Mont
gomen. as a head coat h must do.
has his team's sights focused
stjuareb on the Cougars and
Huskies at the moment, leaving
discussion of NCAA Tournament
hypothetical and the newly reac
quired No. I ranking out of the
equation.
"Our focus is m trying to win
against Washington State on

Ihuisdav." Montgomen said,
"because, at this point, with si\
[games] left, the onl\ thing that
matters is how we do in the last si\
games relative to seeding in the
tournament and potentialK win
ning a I'at -10 championship, ami
the othci stuff doesn't have am
bearing upon that."
I his i> probabh a wise course
of action, considci ing Washing!(>n
State ga\e Sianford a ven lough
game last month, going into half
time onh down In six. The Cartli
nal(2.'M. 10-1 l*ac-10) eventually
won 72-1)1. but the ( ougai s hung
aiound until the verv end antl
gave Montgomery fits on the de
fensive end.
()f course, that was up in I'ull
m.in, which isn't what vou'd (all
one of Stanford's favorite plat es to
visit in the conference — snow,
cold weather and all.
Washington State (11-12. 1-9)
does have some talent, namely in
junioi swingnian Mike bush, antl
coach Paul Craham is doing a
commendable jt)b with Ins sixth
plat c squad this season, espc( ialh
considering the Cougars went a
woeful 1-17 within the tonferente
last season (with the lone win coin
ing against ( al).
