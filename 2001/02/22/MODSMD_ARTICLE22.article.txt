put the (Cardinal at the top of the conference.
Unfortunately for the Stanford women, while
things were hot on Frida\. this weekend, the confer

travels np to Washington State (10-15-8) and Wash

I he Cardinal currently sits at third in the confer

a half game behind the Huskies. However. Cal and
Ari/ona still aren't that far out of championship con

"It's still sut ha wide open race," said head coach

should both be tones to contend
with.
I think that the tilings von have
to do are the same even week,"
VanDerveer said. "When we have
been successful, we plav well deten

areas."
Tonight. Stanford meets the
Cougars at Pullman. Stanford
toasts a 31-0 all-time record over
Washington State. However, after
last week's game against Cal. the
Cardinal knows that losing
records makes teams all the more
eager.
After winning onh one confer
ence game last season, the ('.ougars
have come on strong this vear, de
feating several top teams, includ
ing Oregon and Arizona.

Senior Yvonne Volkman has
boosted the offense in recent
games, and leads Washington
State in scoring with 11.9 points
per game. Controlling tlu- point
tor the Cougars is .Vfoot-3 Katie
Nvseth, uho has been a consistent
force all season. Nvseth pla\s the
tvpe of small-guard athletic game
that gives the Cardinal some trou
ble.
On Saturdav, Stanford travels
to Seattle to lake on the I lu>kies.
Washington is led bv senior
guard Megan Fran/a, who is av
eraging 17.2 points per game.
While Fran/a was well-contained
in the game at Maples, she has
been shooting well latel\ and
could give the Cardinal some
major problems.
In addition to Fran/a, freshman
Ciuliana Mendiola and sopho
more Loree Pavne round out a
strong guard combo for the
Huskies. While both underclass
men are strong offensive threats,
Mendiola adds strong rebounding
to the Washigton arsenal.
