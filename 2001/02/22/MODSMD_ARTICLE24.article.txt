the I )est win ning pet 'telltales in Stanford s ri< h tennis
lusioix and, as a freshman, plaved on arguablv the
best (ollegiate team e\cr fielded.
And the list goes on and on.
If von had ncvci heard about Kim's unbelievable
retold as a tennis plavei. vou would never guess his
simess from |iisi talking with the modest senior.
"Ilonestlv, I don't like to talk about tennis very
much,' Kim said. Tin around the game so much thai
I don't like to talk about it am more than I have to.
I lowever, do not take Kim's comments the wronjj
wav. Although he prefers to sta\ off the topit when 1 11
is not bus\ sinac king a huge forehand past his oppo
nent 011 the (ourt, Kim still loves the game.
"I like tennis for its high competitiveness," kini
said. "It's a great spoil because it combines so mam
different parts of vour bod\ and also vour mind."
Kim, an economics major, has come to love the
spoi 1 so mm h that he has his eyes set on joining sev
eral of Ins old Stanford teammates 011 the profession

at toni alter graduation.
"When I came into (ollege, I was considering doing
pi e-nu'd or engineering, hut. at the end of the summer
after mv sophomore vear, something clicked, and I
si.ii ted |>l«i\ ing ven well and stat ted to have a lot mot e
confidence in in\ game," Kim reniemhered. " I hat's

ping stone to gi eater things.
"()n an individual level, I'm it\ing to improve mv
game to where i can take in\ game to the highest
level," Kim s.iid. "Winning the NCAA singles title is
not thi' highest level in tennis. It's a great achieve
ment. hut the pinnacle of tennis is winning a Crand
Slam tournament and becoming number one m the
world. M\ philosophx towards tennis is aimed to
wards achieving that."
Besides tins ver\ goal-oi ienteel attitude, Kim s pri
marv desire to help the team win contributes to Ins
claim that the title came as a pleasant surprise.
"M\ number one goal last yeai was to win the team
title," Kim said. "1 focused a lot of energ\ and emotion
on that, and w hen we were fortunate enough to win it
last vear. I was so happ\ that I never thought much
about the individual tournament. I just took it match
