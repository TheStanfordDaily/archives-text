As far as romantic comedies go,
the puke factor for "Down to Karth"
is relatively low. It l. r > vears of con

lead, a struggling comedian named
Lance Barton. His jokes sin k and
the onl\ reaction he ever gets from
the audiences ol Amateur Night at
the Apollo is an overwhelming cav
alcade of boos and insults.
This is Rock's first film where he
has top hilling. When Intermission
asked him about being a leading
man, he had this to say: "1 don't
think about it like that. When 1 did
'l.ethal Weapon IV,' 1 wasn't like,
'1 should he playing the Mel Gib
son part.' When I'm on camera,
I'm the leading man. I choose parts
I like to play and want to play."
So here's a quit k plot summary:
Barton dies and goes to heaven,
whit h happens to Ik- a cheesy-look
ing 1..A. night club run by Mr. King
(Cilia/./ Palminterri). There, he finds
out that they've made a mistake. To
corral their mega-error, Barton re
turns to earth with Mr. King and his
idiotic assistant, Mr. Keyes (Eugene
I evy). Barton ends up in the body of
the billionaire corporate scumbag.
Charles Wellington.
Eventually, Barton (trapped in

side of Wellington) falls in love with
Sontee Jenkins,a s<xial ac tivist who
hates Charles Wellington.
Now, out of fairness, let me sa\
what I liked about this movie. First
and foremost: Chris Rock delivers .1
good performance loaded with
jokes, comic monologues and clever
one-liners. It is through hischarat
ter that we come away with some of
the more profound (using the term
loosely) implications of the film: Is
sues like self-identity, racial con
sciousness, the importance of phil
anthropy and the übiquity of love.
In fact, aside from Rock's noble
scriptwriting intentions, the onl\
thing I enjoyed about this film \\ ;is
the acting. Regina King delivers .1
strong performance as Rock's love
interest, as do Mark Addv (" The
Full Monty") and Wanda Sykes .is
the house staff at the Wellington
F st ate.
1 have mixed feelings about this
film. It was entertaining and dis
satisfying at the same time. Ihe
seemingly unending problems
with the technical aspects of the
plot were frustrating, as was the
desire to see some of the more in
teresting themes of the film played
out more.
If you want to have a good time
with a few laughs and don't mind
spending a ton of money at one of
our local bourgeois movie dens,
then check it out. However, if you
want to see a film that aspires to
meet some sort of artistic or aes
thetic minimum, stay far. far away.
This movie is the epitome of
Hollywood — a remake of a re
make of a romantic comedy. The
directors had too much money
and too much talent to handle.
The result was this misguided,
amusingly mediocre contribution
to the "rent-it, don't go-out-and
see-it" world of the Blockbuster
Corporation.


Big smiles, everyone.
