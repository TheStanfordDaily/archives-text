"(Touching llger, Hidden Drag

with none ot its stats nominated in
the acting categories. Plus, subtitles
aren't popular with tlu- voters.
In the ineantime, there is this
plea to the meiniters ol the Acade

not a good movie. Listen to the dia

Imagine the storyline without all
those pretentious special ellects. l'he
film falls from memory faster than
one of those "lull I louse" reruns.
I lonestly, you might as well give
the Best Picture Award to a (Holly
