It is a stretch to make sense ol the

A gem in tbe album is a mad ( ow

tbe song, "Y\'el( oine to this World."
Those Brits — lull ol twisted

Submarine wants ver\ badb to
establish itself in tbe British trip

short in soul and substance. How
ever, I kairo's appealing voice
and the band's sometimes-clever
lvrics redeem the album and cre
ate an almost-reali/ed potential
lor a good band, tliven time to
polish itscll and its sound. Subma
rine should turn into a band worth

ears open for this band's next
album, but, until then, add some
