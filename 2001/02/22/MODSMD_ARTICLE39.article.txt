the despairing "1 he Company

Carthy grew up on the road
with her British folk, musician
parents. Martin Carthv and
Norma Watcrson, joining in
their shows, while a more ap

have been grammar school.

singing, "I don't want to be one

beautiful people are boring."
Unfortunately, Carthy's rumi
nations often remain little
more than ruminations —
views of relationships by the
dispossessed and songs of de
spair — offering little relief
save the odd abstract word of
encouragement.
The music enhances this
dour tone, but it: often sounds
like something should he added
or taken away. The album fail.s
to at lue\ e it's full potential, and
ends up as more a collection of
sketches 1 ban a cohesive whole.

Despite its w eaknesses, the

Fhe album has caught the at

doubt hoping that those tired
of tlu- some old thing will be at
traded to Carthy. Hut I don't
think they're expecting the
checks to start rolling in quite

"Angelc & ( igarcties" is a ni< e
little album. hut it's more a sign ol
Carthv's potential than an end in
and ol itself.
