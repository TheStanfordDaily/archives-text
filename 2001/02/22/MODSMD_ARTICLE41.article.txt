Sex comes in main colors at
Vol pal (.alien s "Beaux and Fros:
An Exhibition ol Romantic and
Erotic Art," and will keep doing so
on the corner of ( '.rove and Cough
streets in San Francisco until
March SO.
It comes in the juicy red and blue
ol \aiu\ W illis's painting. "Anita
and ( ai los.'' I'lie glossy, dripping
oils ol W illis's piece actualh intro
dii( ethegallen viewer to the upper
lloor collection, and thev do so with
erotic llair. Two figures dancing,
one i ed and one blue, wouldn't nor
mally be considered erotic, even
with her leg lch ked around his as it
is. Hut the absoluteh juicy colors
miikr the painting about sex and can
lea\ e a viewer salivating in a slightlv
indecent wav.
It comes comic hook style, as in
Alain Laurent's "Captain Marvel."
llu* captain, heroically yellow and
blue in Ins tights, flexes his super
powers in front of a girl lying prone
on a slab of marble. Behind, statues of
super-bull naked dudes looking
away from the captain, phallic
mosques towering above him and a
(heet.ib next to him make up the con
trasting hyper-realistic landscape.
It comes in the striking silver
print, "Boch as Moonscape," by

Craig Scoliotic. In the tinv "l.a Ce
lestine bv I'ablo Picasso. In the
countless annoving rip-ofls of
Kdouard Manet's 1 <S(>r> painting,
"Olvmpia." In the incredihh taste
ful mezzotints of Vozo I lamaguc hi.
In Colette Hebert's "Move
ment # 1," se\ is an interesting mix
of media; the piece uses gold leal
on aluminum as its base fora mix
of paints. I'he result is a flowing
piece about the heterogeneous na-

ture of the
mixing be
twe en
sexes. We
never mix
complete
ly. Instead,
we meet
each other
much like
the blue,
pink, silver
and gold of
the paint
ing do.
I I n
Brenda At
wood's
"The Night
of the
Minotaur,"
sex is a se
ries of dia
logues be
tween a

blindfolded man and a red-haired
woman. A man holding the light
source for the c ulmination of these
dialogues bends over bis light-rod
to watch. In the centei of the- piece,
the previoush blindfolded man
kisses the woman alter banishing
the minotaur within him to (lie
shadows and into a seat.)
In Osvaldo Ruiz Muuoz's series
ol pieces, sex was finally confined to
Toi Adult's FvesOnh" section. In

"Valentine." the tirst in the section.
se\ was even interactive. \ cut-out,
made of gouache on construction
paper, depicts a naked woman hold
ing her private parts open. On a
chair below her, a miniature woman
stands erect on the back ola man
standing on a chair. B\ pulling on a
tab, viewers could raise and lowei
the cut-out over the little people. I b
larious and insightful. Munoz's
other pieces bad the same llair for
combining s< n ial < ommentarv. sex
and satire into one interactive
piece.
Following the voung miss and
bet miniature friends was (ieorge
Washington, Iresbb cut from a
dollat bill, getting a blow job from
a plainh clothed woman with (lie
window open. Next came (ieorge
in a dress. Although 1 didn't be
lieve am real limits were breac bed
in the show. Munoz nia\ have
come the closest to stepping ovei
the line.
I he most attractive piece in tbe
show, and possibh the defining
piece lor Im>ili the show and the
gallerv. was Ron Boise's lOtvl
s» ulpture, "Loliopa |hivaka." Bat k
in 1 *><"»'.). the direc tor ol the gallerv,
Mnldoon Fidel, was brought to
trial tor tbe sale ol obscene works
because ol the 10-inch-tail metal
statue.
But, first, some on the work. Its

scrap metal i rudely welded togeth
er makes tip a non-gendered per
son on his knees, holding the waist
o! .1 standing female. She. in turn, is
clutching his shoulders, and look
ing up into the light in et sias\ 1 lei"
head contains no fat e. and the light
pours into her entire being as she
screams in pleasure.
1 he metal is coining apart at the
seems with this pleasure, as the 1 h»t
torn one's torso is kept hack from
devouring her hv a mere string of
connected welding. Her elbow, just
acrink put in the middle of her arm
piece, contains .ill the tension ol the
moment, conveving the beaut\ of
the impending orgasm.
W hen the piece was on trial.
Muldoon Klder's camp t ailed Dr.
Bernard Diamond, an art collector
and psychiatrist, to the stand. He*
testified to the nature of erotit art
when he said, under oath," Ihe de
piction ol love in art is an uplifting
force in our culture. 1 his is bet ause
art at Ids to the stature of anything it
treats in a serious manuei."
I his is really why se\ can come m
so many dillerent colors and shapes
in a cohesive show about the nature of
love. sc\ and happiness without over
stepping am societal Ixumdaries. As
long .is each work treats the subjei i se
riously . it is art, and it < an only add to
the discourse. And who realK has a
problem with se\ anyway?
