and Lilla l oal, along with a
highly impressive staff and
east, will bring to Stanford a
quality production of the
world's longest running
play. Since its premier in
1952. (Christie's play has
been seen by over 9 million
people, produced in 44
countries and translated into
24 languages.
So what is the scenario of this
timeless whodunit thriller? It's
quite simple. Kight people are
snowed-in at a hotel. One of

and who will he the next \it tim?

With only five weeks of re
hearsals, director Maggie Siska
— a senior who has also direc ted
"Crazy For Von." "Anything
does" and Stage One's "Merrilv
We Roll Along" — cleverly
stages this thriller on the Roble
Parlor stage.
The costumes designed by
graduate student Saimah
Ashraf, as well as the set and
technical compositions, are true
to Christie's historical setting.
And, with the aid of dialect
sheets, the actors do an impres
sive job with their challenging
accents.

Siska.
In their co-producers's note,
Kaplan and Toal remark: "This
production was conceived in the
spirit of bringing .1 truly fun and
popular piece of theater to the
Stanford campus." Unlike the
usual ultramodern plays, this
production should be a refresh
ing and exciting experience for
the Stanford audience.
"The Mousetrap" will be
playing at the Kohle Hall Parlor
tonight and Friday night at 8
p.m.. and on Saturday .it 2 p.m.

like fraternity parties — the
show will be over by p.m.
