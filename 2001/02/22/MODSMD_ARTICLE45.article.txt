Sex. Death and Aero
bics,'' presented In the
(California I'r.tvel i 1 oupe
and the Performing
Artists Group, is ,1 set of
six one-acts th.it are hit
or-tniss. Ihe nnevetiness
is even more apparent
here, since most of the
hits come in the first half.
The first act, "Pro
logue," sets the stage for
the subsequent streams of
consciousness and lofty
ideas. A lot of scamper
ing, a lot of laughs and a
lot of energy. Zac Jaffe
and Jack Karp. led by di
rector Elaine Jannell and
writer Alan Fitch, are the
guys hamming it up din -
ing the opening act.
The best, most com
pelling act is likely "Aer
obaci/e Queen," featur

ing Riki 1 andholm as .1 fit
ness guru u ho pushes her
students to Ik* "winners"
in life. Lindholm, in .1
solo performance, con
vincingly interacts with
several audiem e mem
bers, screaming for thetn
to either put in elfort or
get out. "Aerobaci/e
Queen" is directed by for
mer nun Dennv I bunder
.ind is written by Richard
Ciccarone.
Another worthy pre
inter'mission effort is "So
Middle Class," a tale of
two men in the park writ
ten by Daniel Can/011. A
homeless guy who wants
to talk about his zoo visit.
Tobey (Michael Green)
looks the part, complete
with color-clashing duds,
potbelly and scraggly
beard. His friendliness is
ignored by Thomas (Russ
Duffy), a member of the

übiquitous hard-working
middle-class. Only there
to read his book, Thomas
reluctantly i>> pushed over
the edge and starts throw
ing verbal metaphors
back at 1 obey. Director
Rachel Rajput's resolut
ion of the proceedings is .1
welcome surprise.
Following ,1 brief inter
mission is .in even briefer
"Thursday Night," with
Duffy now portraying a
divorced man claiming
his belongings. His ex,
played by Karen Bulkot,
puts her foot down when
an old ficus tree is disput
ed. First-time director
Vonn Scott Bair, along
with writer Linnet Har
lan, has a decent enough
concept, but the act feels
incomplete.
Next up is "San Fran
cisco Fever," written by
Anne Adams. Set in Gold-

en Gate Park, the
meeting between
two women (Ren
nee Christian and
I leidi YVolfT) begins
cordially enough —
until the subject of
men < nines up. Past

ghosts are unearthed,
making this tea-time af
fair directed In Bert van
Aalsburg rather uncom
fortable by the time the
lights flash off.
Trying to encompass
all three themes (sex.
death and aerobics),
"Stress Test" is perhaps
the most disappointing
act. Bulkot returns as a
nurse who challenges a
prescription- holding
man (Keith Madden) with
the test of his life. During
the encounter, Madden
meets a philosophical
doctor (real-life dentist
Ralph Filice) who pre-

sents .1 variety of scenar
ios to the bewildered pa
tient. Alas, the over
reaching act ends, and
you're left wondering,
"So what?"
()verall. though "Sex,
Death and Aerobics" is an
inexpensive, two-hour
performance that is remi
niscent of Winter One
Acts at Stanford. While I
think Stanford's version
is usually a bit more con
sistent in its humor, tone
and dramatic build-up,
there's no reason why you
shouldn't cheek out the
six acts al Community
College of San Francisco.
