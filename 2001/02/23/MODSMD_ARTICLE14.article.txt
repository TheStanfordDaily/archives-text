Kureishi's work takes a fresh look at
questions of family, assimilatic>u and im
migration. Born in London in l!>.~>l to a
Pakistani Imli.m fatlici and a Bniisli
mother, bis novels, short stories and
screenplays reflect both the "mixture of
continents" he inherited from his par
ents and his c»lining ot age in the 1 one lon
suburbs.
In the opening paragraph of his
novel. " 1 he "Buddha <>1 Suburbia." the
central charactei speaks fbi kureishi in
all but name. "My name is Karim \mir.
and 1 am an Fnglislnnan he>i n and bred,
almost . . . Pei haps it is the odd liiixtui e
of continents and blood, of here and
there, ot belonging and not. that makes
me restless and easily bored. Oi perhaps
it was being brought up in the suburbs
that did it."lie s.i\ s.
"I can remember the boredom ot
most of my adolescence." Kureishi said.

Asked about the autobiographical na
ture ot his work, he said, "If it didn't
happen to me, it happened to someone
else.
Kureishi always knew that he wanted
to be a writer, as did Ins father, yvho
y\oi keel at the Pakistani Embassy in I on
don. lie recounts how, every day after
school, he would write from tour until
seven, accruing the stamina it takes to
w rite fora li\ ing.
At the age of IS. itching to find a
world broader than the claustrophobic
suburban landscape in which he had al
waysliyed. he began working at the box
of lice ot London's Royal ( ourt Theater.
I just wanted to get out of the sub
urbs." he s.ml. "1 wanted to meet anyone
w ho did c ulture full time."
When " I lie King and Me" emerged
"vei\ successful and tunny." according
to kureishi. he retired from working and
embarked on Ins writing career full
time.
Kureishi's witty. straightforward wiit -
ing st\k\ he s.ivs. is the product of a
wrilei who believes "The Arabian
Nights to be the best ston evei written
and whose 1 "stuff is influenced by Ker
ouat. Salingei and |eflerson Airplane."
Kure ishi's canon is a first-generation
immigrant collection that navigates the
intersections and gaps between the
country in which he gu w up. Fngland,
and the ghost ot the country that was his
father's home, Pakistan, fie had nevei
been to Pakistan until the I'JNOs. when
he traveled to Karachi for several
months to visit the tnembeis of his fami
ly who lived there. It is wonderful to be
welcomed .is a part ot vour extended

However, he deeply disliked what he
described .is the "lslami/ation" of Pak
istan. I lis iiih les were |»>ui nalists. and the
ine ieasingly stiut Muslim rule forced
them to encrypt and limit tlicit stories.
l oi this reason. kureishi, who "be
lieve[s| in speaking freely and
openl\ .md in telling stories." said
ill.it lie could not live in Pakistan.
"l-.ven though I didn't tit in
Kngland. I didn't lit in kar.ichi ei
ther." Kureishi commented.
I lie frankness, punctured bv

raucous humor and poignant \ that
penades his work leads one to be
lieve that Kureishi has constnu ted a
home through his art. despite the
homelessness inherent in a lite
straddling two worlds.
"In the end, vou write because
von hope to give people pleasure,
he said.
In a softer tone, he added. "But I
also write because 1 wanted people
to know what it was like (to grow up
