to find out what their children have been
up to sim e September. Parents will fill din

Saturday. We commend parents for finding the
time to make the trip to campus and encourage
them to take advantage of I niversity-spon
sored activities. But, while parents should at

priorit\ is making time to learn more about
Stanford life diret tlv from their ( hildren.

One way to improve communication — dur
ing the weekend and afterward — is for par
ents to get a better sense of the everyday lives ol
their children. Parents will now lx- able to un
derstand why students rarely wake up before ( .)
a.m., who their friends are and why they are all
dressed up (probabh because they need to do
laundry).
Parents can also be reintroduced to academ

Students, in turn, can share their new interests

Additionally, because most students' lives
center on their residences, we encourage par

the specific issues that residents are facing.
With .in understanding of how Stanford
works on social, academic and extracurricular

Parent's Weekend is a long-standing tradi

University staff, volunteers and students to cre
ate a welcoming environment in which parents
can learn about Stanford. However, we think it
is just .is necessarv for parents and students to
have open, respectful conversations about their
experiences.
By attending University programs — and
making time tor real conversations with their
children — parents can make this weekend a
