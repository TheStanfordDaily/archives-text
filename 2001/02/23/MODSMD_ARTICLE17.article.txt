# THE 						HARLEQUIN MANNEQUIN
## Joggers to the rescue! 
### 
The real world tinulh impinges
on Stanford. For several weeks,
while i lie rest of(California coin
plained about power outages
and utility deregulation, and dot-coins
died from lack ol ele< trie itv, we continued
our pursuit of truth, beauty and beer.
Mundane things like power shortages
do not affed this ivory tower. Our facili
ties guy, Chris Christofferson, was cjiik k
to claim credit for the University's far
sighted energ\ conservation policies. We
have out own co-generation plant. If all

else (ails, we have an
army of electrical engi
neering graduate stu
dents. Just .is ('alifornia
stands apart from the
rest of America, Stan
ford stands apart from
(lalifornia.
Not so recently.
To be suit*, the tain-

pus remained blissfully calm timing the
hour-long, campus-wide blackout three
weeks ago. I here were no rioters in White
Plaza burning l-llum books tor warmth.
No looters taking advantage of the shut
down in security alarms to relieve the
Stanford Bookstore of some of its
monopoly profits. In Green Library, stu
dents squatted in patches of sunlight or
ciustered around little lamps that re
mained lit.
I he only pandemonium I witnessed
involved the lone soul in mv hallwav
screaming for his lost paper. We ignored
him.
After all. something will be done. We
have so much money — not to mention an
armv of electrical engineers. But, 1 saw
awav with this complacency! Our far
sighted conservation polities have tailed.
Our electrical engineering gratl students
were not able to solve the problem.
So 1 propose a plan to handle such con
tingencies. This plan will prevent black
outs. It will galvani/e students across (ani
pus and give them a sense of purpose. It
will build th.it unique sense of self-worth
that comes from community service. Each
student will contribute to the best of his or
her ability. It will harness our I niversitv
culture to solve a I niversitv problem.
Let's attach electrical dynamos to all
joggers on Gampus Drive.
This is not as infeasible as it may seem.
It's .ill quite simple, really. Our electrical
engineering gratl students will built! little
portable dynamos. These are simple con
traptions. lust suspend a magnet inside a
wire coil. A jogger's every step will bounce
the magnet around, producing an electri
cal current. Attach a capacitor to each
portable dynamo and voila! We'll have
several hundred joggers around campus,
all generating electricity.

So much for the technicalities. What
about implementation? It's pist as simple.
File police who currently stand under a
stop sign on Junipero Sena will, instead,
stand undei .in ecjui\alent stop sign on
Campus Drive. Ratliet than gl.ire at ever\
cli ivcr passing bv, thev will clisti ibute these
c lever little gadget s to every jogger passing
b\. Those who refuse will be given a tic ket
for not stopping at stop signs. With this
policy in place, even jogger becomes a
generator of scarce elec trie al power.
Consider how many Stanford students
jog. Kveryday. Anytime. Kvervwhere.
I 'hey spend hours every week running
around in circles. If vou c an't look elegant
doing it — and no one looks elegant with
all of his or her bouncy bits, well, bouncing
— vou may as well make it productive.
Consider the personal advantages. Fv
eryone knows that you're not a "serious"
jogger unless vou wear a set of ankle
weights. Our mechanical engineering
grad students c an tailor the weight ofeac h
individual dynamo to your specific needs.
our training regimen would be stepped
up. Conversations with fellow joggers
would improve. Instead of useless, banal
comments about pa\ ing the Foothills, just
imagine:
"So how's the power generation
today?"
"()h, I'm taking it easy. ('.locking about
five kilowatt-hours."
Within weeks, we could be supplying
power to all of Northern (California, l ac h
of us can generate revenue just In engag
ing m our beloved Stanford pastime.
Think of the money! Let's do a startup.

IXI Sluing a <otermituil student in interna
tional policy studies. You ran reach hi in at
mazann(a) Stanford,edu when he is not bus\
logging.
