Sports column 'ignorant'
In response to Ryan Stewart's column,
"No Cheers for Cheeiieading," 111 Mon
day's sports sec tion, 1 would just like to sa\
that ignorant sports columnists make
much more of .1 mockery ot sports than
am ehecrlcading competition. No, I .1111
not some disgruntled clieei leadet writing
m to defend m\ ( raft, but 1 am, gasp, a fe
male who actuallv knows and c ares about
sports. 1 completely resent Stewart's Ne
andertlial-ish representation of "female
ignorance." Stewart's appalling use of
stereotypes denotes that either he lias
been brainwashed b\ someone from the
l ( .)f>()s or that he doesn't get out much. 111
any event, 1 would like to assure him that
the male sex in 110 wav has a monopoly 011
the understanding of sports — I'm sure if
you asked Mistv llvmanoi Fogan loin,
the\ could explain ejuitc a lot to you about
swimming and volleyball — and that the
female sex most (ei tainlv does not have a
monopoK on ignorance. Stewart is a case
in point.

Student-TA relationships risky
As .i student and teat liing assistant, I am
more than a little disturbed b\ |ackie
Can's suggestion in Wednesday's paper
that students and teaching assistants
should "get over" our sense of profession
alism and enter into sexual relationships
whenevet oui hormones suggest it. Her
column irresponsibly dismisses serious
concerns about academic integrity and
sexual harassment that can result from
siu b careless attitudes.
Can bases her argument on the state
ment that "Stanford is not the workplace,
and we must not assign to it the same level
of professionalism." ()n the contran , this is
indeed inv workplace. Moreover, paid as
sistants have a rcsponsibilit\ to ensure, and
students pa\ ing tens of thousands of dollars
.1 year for an education have a light to ex
pect. that their interactions with each other
exemplify professionalism. If anything, the
student-teacher relationship must lx- han
dled even morecaretulh than that between
a lawyer and a newspaper-room lx>v.
As a TA, 1 am responsible for issuing
highly subjective judgments of mv stu
dents' academic work. I Ins is a diflii ult job
under any circumstances and becomes
even more so when a student is also a per
son,il acquaintance. A sexual relationship
is unthinkable in this context. It would be
unfair not only to that student but toall my
other students. Cart perhaps considers
this insignificant, but others ma) disagree,
and I have an obligation to respect that.
1 also have my own interests to consid
er. Any accusation of wrongdoing that
might be brought against me could seri
ously jeopardize the future of mv teaching

career. 1 .mi hardly prepared to dismiss
this risk, and it would take far greater rea
son than the pull of my hormones to make
me wish to incur it. A student who be
comes involved with a 1 A is likewise in
(in ring a risk, since there is no guarantee
that the I As unprofessional behavior will
not extend to deliberate manipulation of
his or her position of power. 1 refer Carr to
the I'niversitv's sexual harassment policy
(see the "Note on Consensual Relation
ships") fora more articulate discussion of
these dangers than I can provide.
1 have been attracted to students of
mine, certainlv, but I have never consid
ered acting on such attraction. Can's ar
guments hardly compel me to do so in the
future. 1 lie attitude she presents per
suades me that she does indeed "have a
while to wait" before she can ( (insider her
self a professional. Her assumption that
the same is true for her fellow students is
ill-founded and inappropriate.

Daily editorial missed the point
Yesterdav's stall editorial, "Parent's
Weekend should include all patents,"
posits that Stanford should reach out to
parents of upperclassmen, and not just
freslunen, hut the coincidental term "up
perclassmen" highlights the truly neces
sarv distinction.
When read not with academic, hut eco
nomic status in mind, the editoi i.il still ap
plies. and brings other, more important
issues to light. lot instance, is it surprising
that upperclass parents spend much of
their time lounging in C.armel, or dining
at overpriced Bay Area restaurants? Of
course not. because the upperclass par
ents, not the underclass parents, are the
ones who can afford to do that.
The editorial gives several reasons wliv
we should increase the number of events
tor upperclass parents. First and foremost.

upperclass parents could hi" a source of
more money. Why rclv onl\ on donations
from alumni when you could liil up the
current parents? Shouldn't the\ support
their children's education? But wait! 1 wo
paragraphs later, the artu le gives awav the
fact that it author do alread\ know about
tuition. Because parents do in fat I alread\
pay for Stanford, the other reason to acco
modate them is because thev deserve to
see where their monev goes. It's a con
sumer's right, isn't ii?
It appears the headline above the edi
torial had the right intent but was be
trayed by its .mthors and its terminolog\
We should make an effort to include those
parents who might be rather excited to see
a great university because their child is the
first in their family to attend one. We
should reach out to those patents who
don't want to see where their monev is
going, but where their son or daughter is
going. Perhaps those patents max not
even be paying for much of their child's tu
ition, thanks to the generosity of the school
(for which lam very grateful.) ()i perhaps
those parents won't even fie here, because
it's .1 little to costly to come attend pri< e\
meals which might |usi be, as I he l)ail\
recommends, aimed at generating .1 tew
more capital donations.

Don't blame Ujamaa
Sabritia Weiner's Feb. 15 letter to the
editor (Ethnic theme dorms 'undermine
contributions of diversity"') expressed her
disappointment with ethnic theme dorms.
I would like to express my disappoint
ment with Weiner's statements.
I respect Weiner's tight to have an
opinion different from mine, hut when
Weiner said that she, "along with other
non-African American trosh who were

placed (in I j), did not It-el comfortable
there, she made I lie grave mist.ike ol
speaking for those other than herself. I
was a freshman in I j. am not blai k. and
was "randonib plated there. 11 lose are
the onh similarities in our expet ieiu es.
I admit that I entered with concerns
about feeling alienatetl or unwelcome (I
suppose that s norm.il). but getting past
those fears and being open with in\ peel s
was .ill I needed to tl<» to bet onie .1 part of
the I j coniniunitN. It seems that Weinei
ne\ei challenged herself to get to that
point. I ( hose to be a part of iu\ freshman
dorm, .iiul in doing so I had an invaluahle
learning expel ienc e.
Weiner calls loi an acatlcmit ellinit

I t 1111 it theme dorms have the tliflu ult
task of being .1 home loi then respective

Ethnic theme dorms important
to many students
111 response to the Feb. 1"> letter re
garding ethnii theme ilornis ("Ftlinii
theme tlornis 'undermine 1 ontributions
of divcrsit\ "), I thought it neccssan to
remind the largei Stanford »omniumt\
about the iinportaiue of theme doi 111 sin
the lives of mam students. 1 hese dorms,
.is well as the communitx tenters, serve
not onh the etlinit communitv. but the
entire community In celebrating the
abundant (iiltui.il communities at Stan
ford .mil induting people to examine
othei customs.
I nst. 1 entireb disagree that theme
tlornis are a cop-out for the I nivetsitv.
I he theme dot nis are hard-won pri\ ileges
fought loi In students 111 the late I'.KiOs. 111
fact, I janiaa, the first theme dormitorv,
w.is treated after students of the Black Stu
dent I nion took the microphone from the
\it 1 provost four da\s after Martin I utliei
King |i.was shot. I he students demand

cd th.it tlie I inu'iMtv take rcsponsihilitx
tor adding divei sit\ t«> the s< ht>ol. Added
as .1 support tor the hl.uk students, I ja
niaa does help the bl.u k eoinnuiuit\. espe
(iall\ in the absent e of .in adequate (0111-
inunitx centei (support tlu- fight tor nunc
coniinunit\ tenter funding). \iul ininoii
t\ communities do need to support e.u li
other.
Second, theme dormitories do not smi
plih the multitude of t ulttires hi the toin
munitv, the\ encourage it. Entering this
I niversitv, I onh knew about three Asian-
Anieruan cultures — ('.hinese, |apanese
.iiul Korean — and I assiunecl I would he
enc'ouutering inostb ( hinese people. Did
vou know that Filipinos are the largest
Asian minorit\ in the ba\ Area: After tour
months in ()kada, I know about Southeast
Asian Americans as well as Vsian l'acifit ls
landers. I know more about the (list rimi
nation that \sian Americans face in the
media and in out government, and I feel
that ()kada has expanded m\ viewpoints
about Asian-American issues, helping me
to examine America's treatment ot 11011-
lil.u k minorities.
1 bird, all tvpes ot people reside ill
()kada, even some anti-affii illative ac lion
kcpuhlu ans I liat s good fodder l(»i de
hale. w huh is instigated on politic al. rat ial
and religious levels. While I believe I of
fended main ot m\ Republican dorm
mates arountl election time, lliev're not
alienated from the ()katla communitN un
less thc\ alienate themselves.
furthermore, while I was also worried
about (li(|iies. I don't believe that all theme
tlorins entourage them. I expected in
()katla that the Asians would stu k togeth
er, and so 1 felt uncointoi table at tlie st.n t,
espet i.ilK around the nppert lassmeu who
alrcath knew e.uli other. I was a new

tieslnnan and knew no one. I was uneas\
tor the first bait of first tjuartei. and so I
made a commitment to get to know the
people in im doi in.
I didn't request to be in (>kada, bin I
tlet itletl to stu kit out bet ause I liguietl I
could learn something about (iiltiues I
bad never experienced. And now I am
glad that I was placed here because I
have met wonderful people and ha\e
been introduced to food and lingo for
eign from im own culture. (Have you
heard ever ot lumpiar 1 hadn't, but it's
good) More important than the differ
ences, though, I recogni/c the similat i
ties between otliei (ultures and nn own,
creating a connection between tlifferent
communities.
Allot het point of (on tent ion is th.it not
all freshmen like their dorm as the\ don't
connect with an\t>ne. I nlike the
Wiener's experience, I've met people in
I jamaa this\ear. I'heY are non-hluck stu
dents, and the\ lt»ve theii dorni hec.iuse
tlie\ tonnet t with then dor inmates. I |.i
-maa was not then til si ( hou e either. \et,
within an etluiit theme dorm, the) ve
found li lends. I nfortunateb, not everv
one ( an live in their fii st ( boice tlorin. As
to ret|tiesting to switch out of the ethnic
theme tlorin, shouldn't Stanford make it
easiei for ever\ uiibappv freshman to
switch? A sii\ person in Hrannei might
dislike living in so vast a house, finding n
impel sonal.
\\ bile 1 am not toi keeping someone m
a house it thc\ are li lib miserable. I think
that doi milories ( .iter to certain t\ pes of
indivitluals. and ibis introvert in Brainier
might be equalh as estrangetl as Wiener
w as m I jainaa. Shouldn't he ot she be al
lowed to change, too.- Where does this
end, and who (let ides who is miserable

enough to upset the housing:
histlv. converting the different theme
dorms to "ctllllit studies dormitories
would undei mine the ver\ pin post* of ed
ucating stutli'tits about other cultures.
While (ulture iu.i\ l>e studied, it is not .111

In all, w bile some people have had expe
