Sports column 'ignorant'
In response to Ryan Stewart's column,
"No Cheers for Cheeiieading," 111 Mon
day's sports sec tion, 1 would just like to sa\
that ignorant sports columnists make
much more of .1 mockery ot sports than
am ehecrlcading competition. No, I .1111
not some disgruntled clieei leadet writing
m to defend m\ ( raft, but 1 am, gasp, a fe
male who actuallv knows and c ares about
sports. 1 completely resent Stewart's Ne
andertlial-ish representation of "female
ignorance." Stewart's appalling use of
stereotypes denotes that either he lias
been brainwashed b\ someone from the
l ( .)f>()s or that he doesn't get out much. 111
any event, 1 would like to assure him that
the male sex in 110 wav has a monopoly 011
the understanding of sports — I'm sure if
you asked Mistv llvmanoi Fogan loin,
the\ could explain ejuitc a lot to you about
swimming and volleyball — and that the
female sex most (ei tainlv does not have a
monopoK on ignorance. Stewart is a case
in point.

Student-TA relationships risky
As .i student and teat liing assistant, I am
more than a little disturbed b\ |ackie
Can's suggestion in Wednesday's paper
that students and teaching assistants
should "get over" our sense of profession
alism and enter into sexual relationships
whenevet oui hormones suggest it. Her
column irresponsibly dismisses serious
concerns about academic integrity and
sexual harassment that can result from
siu b careless attitudes.
Can bases her argument on the state
ment that "Stanford is not the workplace,
and we must not assign to it the same level
of professionalism." ()n the contran , this is
indeed inv workplace. Moreover, paid as
sistants have a rcsponsibilit\ to ensure, and
students pa\ ing tens of thousands of dollars
.1 year for an education have a light to ex
pect. that their interactions with each other
exemplify professionalism. If anything, the
student-teacher relationship must lx- han
dled even morecaretulh than that between
a lawyer and a newspaper-room lx>v.
As a TA, 1 am responsible for issuing
highly subjective judgments of mv stu
dents' academic work. I Ins is a diflii ult job
under any circumstances and becomes
even more so when a student is also a per
son,il acquaintance. A sexual relationship
is unthinkable in this context. It would be
unfair not only to that student but toall my
other students. Cart perhaps considers
this insignificant, but others ma) disagree,
and I have an obligation to respect that.
1 also have my own interests to consid
er. Any accusation of wrongdoing that
might be brought against me could seri
ously jeopardize the future of mv teaching

career. 1 .mi hardly prepared to dismiss
this risk, and it would take far greater rea
son than the pull of my hormones to make
me wish to incur it. A student who be
comes involved with a 1 A is likewise in
(in ring a risk, since there is no guarantee
that the I As unprofessional behavior will
not extend to deliberate manipulation of
his or her position of power. 1 refer Carr to
the I'niversitv's sexual harassment policy
(see the "Note on Consensual Relation
ships") fora more articulate discussion of
these dangers than I can provide.
1 have been attracted to students of
mine, certainlv, but I have never consid
ered acting on such attraction. Can's ar
guments hardly compel me to do so in the
future. 1 lie attitude she presents per
suades me that she does indeed "have a
while to wait" before she can ( (insider her
self a professional. Her assumption that
the same is true for her fellow students is
ill-founded and inappropriate.

Daily editorial missed the point
Yesterdav's stall editorial, "Parent's
Weekend should include all patents,"
posits that Stanford should reach out to
parents of upperclassmen, and not just
freslunen, hut the coincidental term "up
perclassmen" highlights the truly neces
sarv distinction.
When read not with academic, hut eco
nomic status in mind, the editoi i.il still ap
plies. and brings other, more important
issues to light. lot instance, is it surprising
that upperclass parents spend much of
their time lounging in C.armel, or dining
at overpriced Bay Area restaurants? Of
course not. because the upperclass par
ents, not the underclass parents, are the
ones who can afford to do that.
The editorial gives several reasons wliv
we should increase the number of events
tor upperclass parents. First and foremost.

upperclass parents could hi" a source of
more money. Why rclv onl\ on donations
from alumni when you could liil up the
current parents? Shouldn't the\ support
their children's education? But wait! 1 wo
paragraphs later, the artu le gives awav the
fact that it author do alread\ know about
tuition. Because parents do in fat I alread\
pay for Stanford, the other reason to acco
modate them is because thev deserve to
see where their monev goes. It's a con
sumer's right, isn't ii?
It appears the headline above the edi
torial had the right intent but was be
trayed by its .mthors and its terminolog\
We should make an effort to include those
parents who might be rather excited to see
a great university because their child is the
first in their family to attend one. We
should reach out to those patents who
don't want to see where their monev is
going, but where their son or daughter is
going. Perhaps those patents max not
even be paying for much of their child's tu
ition, thanks to the generosity of the school
(for which lam very grateful.) ()i perhaps
those parents won't even fie here, because
it's .1 little to costly to come attend pri< e\
meals which might |usi be, as I he l)ail\
recommends, aimed at generating .1 tew
more capital donations.

Don't blame Ujamaa
Sabritia Weiner's Feb. 15 letter to the
editor (Ethnic theme dorms 'undermine
contributions of diversity"') expressed her
disappointment with ethnic theme dorms.
I would like to express my disappoint

I respect Weiner's tight to have an
opinion different from mine, hut when
Weiner said that she, "along with other
