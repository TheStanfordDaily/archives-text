Most generally. Roughgarden examines
the "expression of gentler thrtnighout ver
tebrates," but it is her study of same-sex
courtship that receives the most attention.
In her book. "Evolution's Rainbow,"
si hetluled for publication this fall, Rough
g.u tlen explicates the widespread nature of
same-sex courtship thrtnighout the animal
kingdom, and explores win scientists are
reluctant to admit such a phenomenon
untler the broader focus of gender multi
plicity.
\i the foundation of Roughgarden's the
ory is the idea that, although there are only
two sexes, there are a multitude of genders
that are not necessarily pigeonholed to a
specific sex.
According to Roughgarden, gender is
the "wa\ 111 which ,111 individual expresses
sexual identity throughout their life." not
|usi male or female. Appealing to common
mmlsc, she .td.ls lh.it "simply put,

Foi Roughgarden, the .il

In such interaction, "the
