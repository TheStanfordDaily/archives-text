I he internation.il attention the
case re< eived made (tar/611 the pi
oneer of ( m rent attempts to estab
lish an effective internation.il )us
tice system.
In an attic le that (>ar/on wrote
toi the I .ilkmg I leads Web site, he
dist nsses the Statute for the Inter
national ( riminal ('.ourt \n hit li was
signed in 1998.
" I his instrument constitutes
the most serious effort to this date
bv the international community to
fight against the most aberrant
crimes human beings can endure
and suffer." C»ai/on said. " I be in

ternational configuration of these
(times logically demands mea
sures of similar international di
mension to make the instrumental
condition of this statute credible
and useful."
tiar/on continued by saying
that "it is cleat that we cannot re
main passive in the face of system
atic violations of human rights."
Several issues were raised dur
ing the colloquium.
I ( .-Hastings Prof. Naomi Roht-
Arria/a questioned (iar/on on the
interaction between intra-state and
extra-state judi< i.il Ixnlies.
"L nivers.il jurisdiction is based
on the idea that crimes of a univer
sal nature can be tried by domestic
courts of other countries," Roht-
Arria/a said. "What are the effects

within the target state?"
Judge Garzon responded by
clarifying tfie interaction between
international judicial forces and
kx'al jurisdictions.
"Transnational inquisitions
present various difficulties. It is
very complicated to engage two ju
dicial systems which embodv dif
ferent laws, cultures and norms.
However, if a person is convicted
with genocide, terrorism or tor
ture. their crime is considered to
be one against humanity. On this
basis, the person can be subjec ted
to [extra-state] prosecution."
Roht-Arria/a pointed out the
positive outcomes of the involve
ment of multiple justice systems.
"Outside forces can affect do
mestic arrangements. [Interna

tional prosecution attempts] ran
catalyze domestic politics and
make it easier for domestic courts
to function. At first, there was not a
thought that Pinochet could be
prosecuted, and now he is being
indicted in Chile (In |udge |uan
Guzman Tapia]."
During the Pinochet case, pub
lic opinion often expressed that
theatnx itiesof Pinmhet should be
left in the past. "He is an old man,
and it is time to move on," was .1
phrase often heard both in Chile
and in the international media.
Garzon is actively promoting
the need tor improvements in the
international judicial system to
make justice possible in such cases.
"Crimes such as genocide, tor
ture. terrorism and crimes against

humanity demand a genuine re
sponse tli.it is not solelv political,
but mostly legal at the national and
international levels," said Gar/on
in the article posted on the event's
Web site.
C iar/on has been a controversial
figure because he has called into
question the absolute juridical sov
ereigns of nations. However, in a
concluding statement at the
tbrum, lie defended the impor
tance of his actions.
"1 think it is worthwhile to pro
mote certain causes. You cannot
completely comply with previous
societal standards."
