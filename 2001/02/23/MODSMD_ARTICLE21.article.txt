### GUILHERME SOUSA 
I lie clavs of greasv, unhealthy,
late nights at Stern are over. Yes
terday, Stanford I niversit\ Din

guration of Stern's Cvber Cafe,
along with the completely reno
vated (lining hall.
I he new colorful Starbui ks-st\le
1 .ate Nite is located in one of the old
serving areas of the Stern dining
hall and offers students a large tele
vision, cable. DVD plavei and two
types of Internet connections.
for the tables b\ the w.ills. net
work ports are available. Many
students also expressed excite
ment over the installment of wire
less Internet. I Ins wireless Inter
net is particularly necessarv for

the tables in the middle of the
Cafe, which do not have Internet
ports near In. Although comput

the tables, two i Books are available

p.m. to L! a.m., also loans network

"We wanted to create a lot of
excitement around Late Nite."
said Rafi I aherian, executive chef
.ind assistant director of Stanford
Dining Services. " I hen we added
the multimedia concept. You
open up youi book and you're al
ready on the net."
Students, however, have not
maximized theonlinecapabilit\ of
the (.ate during its first ciuai ter (>f

existence. "I haven't seen anyone
use their computer here," said ju
nior Rosalvn Huynh. "1 guess it
defeats the whole purpose of it."
Some students said that they have
yet to get used to the new environ
ment and have nostalgic memo
ries of the greasy and unhealthy
wavs of the old Late Night.
" 1 don't like it as much as the ghet
to Late Nite," said junior Becca
Loya. When asked what was miss
ing. Lova was quick to answer:
" The ghetto." It appears as if stu
dents do not find the new atmos
phere as homely. Students said
that the efficient, retail look of
Stern's C\ her ( '.afe has taken away
from the friendly environment to
which they had grown accus
tomed. "I'he old Liite Nite was
more triendlv," said Saul Carde
nas, the Stern Late Nite manager.
"People had access to the stafl.
You had access to the students."
Nevertheless, students ac
knowledge' that the advantages of
the new setup are clear. 1 'here is a
greater varietv of food and drinks.
According to |im Webb, one of
the designers of the project, the
intent was to offer "fresh healthy
food, higher-etui products and
versatility."
1 he new menu includes items
like c hit ken Caesar salad, bagels,
cookies, subs, wraps, desserts and
even sushi. And.for the nostalgic
Late Night fans, pi/./.a, buffalo
wings and chic ken tenders are still
available. A large variety of Star
bin ks coffee chinks, juices and
smoothies are also offered.
On the other hand, students
feel tliev niav Ik- paving a price for
the high level menu. "[The] line is
a little longer," Huynh said, "but
the food is better."
Stern now offers one of the most
versatile and high-end eating op
tions on campus, and Dining Ser
vices boasts that Lite Nite is the
cleanest, healthiest option tor after
hours. Students agree that, last
year, the idea of a "clean" and
"healthy" Lite Nite would have
passed as a joke. Ironicallv, now
that it has become .i realitv, many
miss the old st\ le and greasv snacks.
In am case, students admit
that Stern's Cvber Cafe has
brought arguabh better food, a
clean modern look and useful and
fun multimedia options. One stu
dent commented on these mixed
feelings, saving that nostalgia is al
most inevitable.
