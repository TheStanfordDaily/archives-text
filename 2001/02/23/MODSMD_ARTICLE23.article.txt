### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Something w.is seriousk
askew in last night's 7. r >-(vl win
over W ashington State — and n
made Sixth Man Club tans shut
their eves tighter than the\ had
when a graduate student missed
three consecutive lavnps in a
"shoot for tuition" contest at
halftime.
I nder the sulfate, it might
have been sinipl\ a hu k of emo
tion that head coai !i Mike Mont
gonierv talked about after the
game.
lint the Maples fans actualh
had the chance to witness the
Cardinal's biggest problem ru st
hand. and. ironically, it hap
pened to be the smallest plaver
on the opposing team.
Six-foot-'J Cougar sophomore
|err\ McN.iir da//led the Pavil
ion crowd like no othei player on
an opposing team has done in a
long time, scoring 29 points from
virtually evervwhere on the
court.
It wasn't .t major scoring
threat, like Oregon forward
Brvan Brace\ 01 Southern Cali
fornia's Brian Scalabrine tli.it
took it to the Cardinal this time.
Rather, it was a guv that had
plavcd for tour minutes and had
scored zero points when the
teams met for the first time this
Near in Pullman. Wash.
"If he's that good [on a partic
ular night], then watch out. be
cause that was one hell of a per
formance," Montgomery s.iid.
f-ven stranger. Mi Nail wasn't
even a starter last night, but in
stead came off the bench and
took advantage of an injun to
Cougars' guard Mike Bush to
earn more plaving time.
" Pliev lost Bush, and the\
didn't miss.ibe.it fwitli Mt Nair],"
Montgomen said.
When Stanford thought he
would drive, he stayed back and
nailed It-pointers. W hen the ( ar
dinal put a hand in his face, he
drove the lane and made tough
lavups l<M»k eas\.

A '25-8 run earl\ in the set oiul
half had given the (Cardinal an
I 1 -|»< »int lead, convincing everv
one that this would Ik- vet anoth
ei blowout <>t an uuranked team,
hut \h Nail proved them wrong.
He s( ored five ot the (ougaiV
next seven field goals, includiiiu

two S-pointets, the last from tlie
corner of the floot. which cut tlu
Stanford lead to onh two points.
Sophomore 11alius Karnes, who
had hcen guaiding \ll \.ui.
could onh sh.ikc his head.


SASHA SIDDHARTHA/The Stanford Doily
Sophomore Julius Barnes was one of many defenders head coach Mike
Montgomery tried against unstoppable Washington State sophomore
Jerry McNair.
"He stepped hack when I
thought he was going to drive. But
then lie shot it. [made it) and I was
like, '(ice/.!' Barnes said.
"I le was on fire, and we didn't
do a good enough joh to shut him
off," Montgonien said. "We even
had post guvs stepping up to help
some, but thev weren't stepping
up aggressively enough."
Montgonien tried as much as
he could to limit the firepower of
the Washington State guard, but
putting different defenders on
linn, like B.irnes in the set ond hall,
didn't woi k.
When asked what he could

have done differenth to guard the
red-hot shooter, Barnes said that
there was only one thing tli.it
might have woi ked.
"I o deny him the hall a little
more,' Barnes said. "Because
[s< nnetiines] he was off balance and
he threw it up and vou thought lie
was going to miss it, but |n went in]."
Fortunateh, the ( ardinal won't
have to won \ about Mt Nail .ig.iin
this season. But it did come off
with a victory, which is more than
former No. 1 North ( arolina did
eailicr this week after similai l\ un
derestimating ( Unison.
I lie lesson foi the ( ardinal now
is to change its nonchalant de
meanor m pl.ning teams-like the
(lotigars. And, in that case, Stan
ford will have its lii si chance to do
soau'ainst Washington tomorrow.
