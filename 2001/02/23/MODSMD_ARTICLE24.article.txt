# Men roar back to defeat Cougars

### TIM KANE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Mike Montgomery was not a
happy man at halftimc last night.
For 20 minutes, the men's bas
ketball head coach watched Ins
No. 1-ranked Stanford team slog
through a lifeless halt against un
derdog Washington State, gri
maced with even - bad pass and
veiled at even missed defensive
assignment.
I he worst, though, he saved tor
the lih ker room.
"He kind of ripped into us a little
bit, got on a couple players, espe
cialh seniors." said redshirt fresh
man forward Justin Davis. "We
weren't hustling, and there was no
energy on the court. I think that
certainly motivated us, because no
body likes to get yelled at."
Whatever Montgomery said,
screamed or did in that locker
room worked like a charm, as the
Cardinal went from being down
eight at halftimc to pulling off a 75-

spite.' being out-rebounded, out
shot and certainly out-hustled.
Sophomore C.asev Jacobsen led
Stanford with 21 points, while se
ilit >1 )arron Collins added 13 and
his brother, redshirt junior Jason,
had 12.
"Needless to sa\. that wasn't one

of our better efforts, Montgomery
said. "We weren't aggressive in the
first half, and they took advantage."
One Washington State player
who took advantage — and then
some — was seldom-used so ph o
inore guard |err\ McNair. who
played all of tour minutes and
scored zero points against Stanford
last month in Pullman.

cameras and a sellout crowd .it
Maples I'avilion, Mc N.tii simply
went off on the ( ardinal, scoring a
career-high 29 points on 1 1 -of-15
shooting, iih hiding fi-of-8 from be

Along with athletic point guard
Marc us Moore, Mc Nail exposed
u bat may be a weak spot in the ('.ar
dinal defense, ail inability to keep
good ball-handlers from getting to
the hoop. With help coining too
late on many oc (asions. most of the
Stanford players could only watch
as Mc Nan kept getting shots and
lay ups oil.
"[Mc Nail | was uncanny ," Mont
gomery said. "We had post guvs
stepping up to help, but they
yvcren't stepping up high enough
or aggressively enough, so he )iist
dropped it in tor bin kets."
Not that the offense y\as that
