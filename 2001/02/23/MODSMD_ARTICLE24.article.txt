# Men roar back to defeat Cougars
## 
### TIM KANE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Mike Montgomery was not a
happy man at halftimc last night.
For 20 minutes, the men's bas
ketball head coach watched Ins
No. 1-ranked Stanford team slog
through a lifeless halt against un
derdog Washington State, gri
maced with even - bad pass and
veiled at even missed defensive
assignment.
I he worst, though, he saved tor
the lih ker room.
"He kind of ripped into us a little
bit, got on a couple players, espe
cialh seniors." said redshirt fresh
man forward Justin Davis. "We
weren't hustling, and there was no
energy on the court. I think that
certainly motivated us, because no
body likes to get yelled at."
Whatever Montgomery said,
screamed or did in that locker
room worked like a charm, as the
Cardinal went from being down
eight at halftimc to pulling off a 75-
(j I victoiT c*\ei the Cougars, de
spite.' being out-rebounded, out
shot and certainly out-hustled.
Sophomore C.asev Jacobsen led
Stanford with 21 points, while se
ilit >1 )arron Collins added 13 and
his brother, redshirt junior Jason,
had 12.
"Needless to sa\. that wasn't one

of our better efforts, Montgomery
said. "We weren't aggressive in the
first half, and they took advantage."
One Washington State player
who took advantage — and then
some — was seldom-used so ph o
inore guard |err\ McNair. who
played all of tour minutes and
scored zero points against Stanford
last month in Pullman.
1 bis time, in front of the TV
cameras and a sellout crowd .it
Maples I'avilion, Mc N.tii simply
went off on the ( ardinal, scoring a
career-high 29 points on 1 1 -of-15
shooting, iih hiding fi-of-8 from be
hind the 3-point line.
Along with athletic point guard
Marc us Moore, Mc Nail exposed
u bat may be a weak spot in the ('.ar
dinal defense, ail inability to keep
good ball-handlers from getting to
the hoop. With help coining too
late on many oc (asions. most of the
Stanford players could only watch
as Mc Nan kept getting shots and
lay ups oil.
"[Mc Nail | was uncanny ," Mont
gomery said. "We had post guvs
stepping up to help, but they
yvcren't stepping up high enough
or aggressively enough, so he )iist
dropped it in tor bin kets."
Not that the offense y\as that
much bettei early on. As a team,

Sophomore Casey Jacobsen, who led Stanford with 21 points, dishes off to
senior Ryan Mendez during the Cardinal's 75-64 win.
Stanford (24-1, 12-1 Pacific-10
('.onferent e) shot 30 percent from
the field in the first half, and the
leading scorer after the first L'O min
utes was Jairon Collins, with only
six points. Making matters worse,
the( ougars (11-13,4-10) were out
rebounding the Cardinal 11>-1 I de
spite being at a major height disad
vantage in the post.
I low about that halftime speech.
c< >ach?
"We had a little discussion at
halftime about effort and where
our heads were." Montgomery said
diplomatically. " 1 lie difference in
mental preparation [between
halves] was like night and day."
I hanks perhaps to Mont
gomery's "discussion" at halftime,
the Cardinal came out roaring to
begin the second half. Keyed by a 3-
poititer from senior point guard
Michael M< Donald, Stanford went
off on a 20-4 run in the first six min
utes. turning an eight-point deficit
into an eight-point lead before the
Cougars could figure out w hat hit
them.

Davis did Ins part with seven
straight points during one stretch,
including .m ama/ing revei sc allev
oop from McDonald that brought
the house down. Washington St.ite
struck back with an 8-0 run during
which only one Stanford startei was
on the floor, but. aftei pulling with
in twoon a 3-pointer from M( Nail,
the (Cardinal i<>< >k control down the
stretch to stave off the pesk\
('ougars.
What might be of concern foi
Stanford f.ms, especialK with the
tourn.iment |iist around the (in
ner, is that the team's lackadaisi( .tl
eflbrt came even after Montgomei \
reminded his squad about how
North Carolina — the team Stan
ford displaced to become No. I —
lost to AC 1C cellar-dweller ( lenison
l.ist week.
"Yeah, he mentioned it at the
shootaround," said center |ason
Collins. "Some guvs just weren't lis
tening. though."
"Somehow we've got to learn
how mentalh to prepare ourselves
tor games," Montgomen s.iid. "1
think we were feeling prett\ self
satisfied coming off the ( .il game.
"Shame on us, we can't let that
happen again. I he next time this
happens, we're going to get beat."
