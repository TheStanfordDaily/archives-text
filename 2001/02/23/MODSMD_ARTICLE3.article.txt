( liief of the 1 )epartinent of (>\ ne

(linnal facult\ of ilu- Si liool of
Meilii ine and the medical stall Of
Stanford Hospital and ( linns,
and both ( urn-nth prai tiie in tlii'
community.
I lie medical journal decided to
retrai't the brothers' articles altei
tiuding that the\ misrepiesenteil
the outcomes of the lb surgeries
tbi-\ pel formed anil on which the

articles are based. Ihe surgeries
were performed in Atlanta in
HMH, two \c.iiN before the broth
el > joined Stanford.
I lie journal's retraction stated
that Fan Xe/hat "has now admit
ted to signifn ant <lim i epani li s be
tween tin- publication and the
original medical records . . . Re
view of this and other court doi n
nients in the public record lias led
the Fditors to conclude that this
paper inaccinateh represents the
data on vvliic hit is based.
"Further, the Fclitoi s cannot be
assured of the accuracy <>l an ear
lier publication tli.it was part of
the same (linieal expcrieni e."
Fhe journal's decision to re
trad the art it les was termed "un
usual" bv Dr. Peter (iregorv. chief

1 lie iet rail ion. however, is
part of an ongoing controvers\
that began in 1901, when a Soutli
i i n ('.alitbrnia woman filed a mal
pra( lice lawsuit. (I.liming that the
brothers did not inioim liei ili.it
the procedure w.is experimental
.md tli.it the\ did not include in
tlieii articles the painful side ef
fects she experienced following
the surgei \.
In a statement that accompa
nied the retraction, larr Ne/liat
claimed tli.it information about
the complications was absent from
the arti( les because tliev were sub
mit let I tor publit at ion short Iv after
the procedures were performed
and before the complications
arose.
I Ins statement was part of a let
ter from l arr, printed alongside
the medical journal's retraction. In
a statement released in response to
the retraction, the Ne/hats lawyer
wrote. " I Ins action is . . . prema
ture. As Fair Ne/liat points out in a
lettei published in the same issue,
the slight discrepancies in patient
tlata had no iuip.it t on the paper's
conclusions."
When the controversv began,
Stanford denounced the claims
against the Na/hats as misinforma
tion. In a letter to the editor print
ed in I lie l)ail\ in April of last vear,
Asst. Prof, of Surgen Mark Vierra
blamed the controversv on "un
substantiated allegations of a r.u ist
attorne\ and a handful of disgrun

tied individuals."
hi November, though. Stan
lord officials tin.ilK appointed a
panel of investigators to look, into
i lit- situation. I lie investigators re
ceived the l(> patient records last
week. "Stanford is vitallv con
cerned ihat its care foi patients
meets the highest standards and
that its research is conducted with
integrity. Gregory said. "To that
end. given the allegations that
have arisen concerning the
Ne/liat clinical and scholarly
work, Stanford has made consid
erable progress in the three ettorts
that comprise our comprehensive
review proc ess."
1 he three parts of the review
process include investigating the
quality assurance work in the gy
necology and obstetrics service,
reviewing allegations of ac adem
ic and scientific misconduct as
thc\ are received and appointing
an outside p.incl to review the ac
tions of the .Stanford Hospital
.iiul Medical School. Patient con
fidentialit\ is respec ted in .ill re
views.
The medical journal's retrac
tion will he added to the material
currenth nuclei investigation.
"Stanford intends to complete
these reviews as soon as possible."
C'.regon said. " I he bottom line is
that we will assure the public trust
in out clinical c are and academic
sc holat ship."
