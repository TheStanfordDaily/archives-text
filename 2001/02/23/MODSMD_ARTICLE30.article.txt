"Sometimes .is a freshman. I .1111 too content
wiili letting older runnel s beat me," said team

done, and that's something I've alwavs looked
up to and strived to become ovei the vears."
With the help of such a strong and support

the cross-country team as a freshman in 1007.
Rising to the status of top-ranked freshman in
the countn and finishing as the (lardinal's fifth

team's national title that war.

\( A A Intlooi (liampionships and had \( AA
outdoor qualifiers in both 1,500-meter and
5,000-meter runs before a stress fracture side
lined him for the rest of the season.
