mauled to death in her San Fran
cisco apartment b\ a neighbor's
dogs in a (hilling I raged \ that
shocked the nation. She was in liei

morrow in their first game ol the
season.
Whipple's death will not be lar

Stanford has been focusing on
cultivating team chemistrv within
a young, somewhat inexperienced
team. In practice this week, the
team worked on new offensive
motions and on its u ausition plav.
I lie team will look to incorporate
these elements in this weekend's
m.it( h.
I nlike the voting Stanford
squad, the t iaels are ret inning 19
letter-winners to this year's team.

their experience, as well as to con
tinue the aggressive play they are
known tor, to give the Cardinal a
run tor its money tomorrow.

oline Osterwise said, "St. Mary's
always proves to be a very physical
team, and we need to avoid being
intimidated by that."

proaches every game the same
way.
"We don't gear our game to
wards the plaving stvle of our op

and we want to be mentally tough
enough to adapt to any situation."
