laughs whenevei she receives e
inails from curious high school
students iii(|uii ing about bowling
at Stanford.
" I liev're looking f<»i hard-tore
learns and st holarsliips, but we just
don't oflei that." I lopkins said.
What the team does offer,
though, is a world of general silli
ness " I'he whole team definitcK
likes to show then bowling sense of
stvle," I lopkins said. "We're alwavs
trving t<> impress e.u h other."

It was, 111 iiu t, their distiiu t sense
of style and ret urring antics that got

the organization California college
teams must belong to in order to

The 199K Las Vegas tourna
ment, from which the team ended
up withdrawing, was particularly
memorable, according to sopho
more treasurer Morgan Marshall.
Paul Baran, who was a freshman at
the time, stole the show in his giant
sombrero, three-piece suit and
"Mardi (iras apparel," according to
a past Daily article.
Not only did this represent a
uniform violation, but Baran grcat

when Ins pants tell down in the lii st
ftame. 1 oin nanient officials also
disliked the alterations Stanford
team members made to theii
names.
Ironically, the Vegas tourna
ment is the oul\ tournament the
team has been able to attend e.u h
\ear since then because of its spe
cial registration policy, which
