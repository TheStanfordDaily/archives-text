SA I 11 is .i hettei indit at< )i «»l at a

not exhibit the large gendei and
i at ial gap e\ it lent with the SA I.
Stanford Dean <»t Admissions
Kohin M.unlet leelsthat Atkinson's
proposal is "misguided.
"()ui studies have shown th.it
SA I stores, when used wiseh in
t onjunt ti<>t i with the other creden
tials m the application files, are
11 setuI m predicting at ademit suc
cess at Stanford," M.unlet saicl.
Mamlet also helieves that it is
possible to list- SA I stores and still
evaluate candidates m the "In»listit
niannei foi w 11u 11 \tkiuson ( .ills.
"While stores (.m nevei tell vim
even thing there is to know about
all candidates, the\ are, for us, a
useful piece in evaluating most ap
plit ants. \lr. Atkinson suggests that
the I ('will move to a 'more lit>listit
appro.u li in evaluating admission
< andidatcs. .is though it is not possi

ble to use standardized tests and re
view applicants holisticallv. This is
simply illogical."
"We are not currently consider
ing making the SAI optional,"
M.unlet said. She states that Stan
fortl will continue to "look at how
candidates use w hat is available to
them'' and "emplov judicious use
of test scores, essavs and letters of
recommendation" in its quest to
"identify those students . . . who
will make a positive difference."
Several Stanford students were
also skeptical about Atkinson's
proposal.
Freshman |ane Yaynman saitl
that the SAI s are necessary. "It's
not a good standard, but you
need to have some standard for
comparison."
Fellow freshman F.li/abeth
Madjlessi shared her concern.
"The SAI 1 tests general aptitude
and inti(.il thinking ability. You
t an use it to compare kids regard
less of what classes thev've taken in
high school."
Freshman Stephanie Dee also
expressed doubts about the re
placement of the SAT with an em
phasis on subject-based tests. "If

the UC schools adopt a curricu
lum-based testing system, then it
will discriminate against low-in
come students who don't have ac -
cess to AP classes or tutors, in this
case, the SAT mav be more effec
tive, since it at least attends intelli
gent people the c hance to do well,
even if they haven't prepared."
Students from California make
up the largest group of those who
take the SA I. (constituting 156,000
out of the 1.3 million high school
seniors who took the test in 2000.
Because at least half <>112 these Cali
fornia seniors appl\ to the I'C sys
tem, the number of students tak
ing the SAT may drop significant
ly should Atkinson's proposal be
adopted.
Caston Caperton, president of
the College Board, the organiza
tion that administers the SA 1 and
other standardized tests, defended
the SAT. "Dropping the SAT from
the admissions process would be
like dropping grades because you
dec ided grades were not a very
good indicator of college achieve
ment. It is a very critic al ingredient
in the college admissions process,
he told the W ashington Post.
