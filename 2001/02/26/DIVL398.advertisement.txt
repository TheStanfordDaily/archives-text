EATING
With a little attention,
you can vastly
improve your pleasure in
eating (whether you cook for
yourself or not), and your mood
and energy level a.s well. Here's
how:
Be Adventurous
■ Try new ethnic foods
■ Taste something vou've
never had before (jicama,
Boston baked beans,
tangerine juice, feta cheese)
■ Create new combinations of
foods (e.g., spread peanut
butter on fruit)
■ Experiment with herbs and
* spices (sweet: cinnamon,
nutmeg, vanilla; savory:
tarragon, basil, cilantro; hot:
chili peppers, cumin, curry)
■ Try a different setting
And when you eat with others,
notice and enjoy their company.
You can both nourish your soul
and feed your body at mealtime.
Play With Your Food
■ Fill your plate with colorful
foods
■ Arrange food artfully on
your plate
■ Notice the textures of a meal
■ Take your time to taste and
enjoy what is in your mouth

and relaxation, and a positive
mental attitude - can make the
difference between just getting
by and feeling great. What you
eat can have a dramatic effect on
your mood, energy and alert
ness. To improve your energy
and mood:
■ Eat breakfast daily
■ Fora continuous source of
fuel, eat regularly through
out the day (every 3 to 4
hours is good)

include both protein and
carbohydrate (e.g., yogurt,
muffin, banana; egg, toast,
orange; tortilla, or a
smoothie)

drates (starch) in every meal
- especially whole grains
and fibrous fruit - and
vegetables at every meal

of water a day (really,
eight!)
■ Eat foods rich in B vitamins
and iron (e.g., greens, grains),
or take a multi-vitamin
daily
■ Be aware of your
sugar, caffeine and alcohol
intake (after the initial rush,
they can make you feel
sluggish and crankv)
■ During stressful times, eat
foods high in anti-oxidants
(fruits and vegetables), and B
vitamins (grains, fortified
cereals)
■ For better sleep, trv a snack
such as tryptophan-rich
warm milk; or toast and jam
(a combination of a simple
and a complex carbohy
drate); or a baked potato;
avoid spicy and high fat
foods right before bedtime
■ For pre-menstrual symp
toms, try a high carbohy
drate, low sugar, low sodium
diet
For Snacks
For good energy-packed snacks,
try:
■ Whole grain crackers
■ Fresh fruit and vegetables
■ Nuts and dried fruit
■ Instant oatmeal
■ Peanut butter and jelly or
honey on toast
■ Potatoes and yams (micro
