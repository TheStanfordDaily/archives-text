1987
On Feb. 2t>, 1987. I lie Dail\ printed an
article about the still-drv Lake l.agunita.
"Bv this point in the vear more than a
few freshmen probabh think th.it Lake La
gunita is fictioti dreamed np bv Stanford
recruiters.
"But f»e advised that vou (an now begin
polishing your windsurfer.
"According to|oe lVtrm (i. (litectoi «>1
sailing, current water levels in nearb\ leldt
and San Fransquit<>( 1 eek suggest that
Lagunita will till during the next set of hcaw
rains, which are expei ted within the month.
"The sailing program provides .1 variet\
of programs on Lagunita dm ing the >pi ing
quarter. Most notabh. the < lasses in w ind
surting and sailing, offered through the
Athletic Department, are the third and
fourth most popular com ses .11 Stanlot d, ac
cording to statistics 1 ompiled b\ the Regis
trar's offit e.
"In the coming quartet. .'VJ sei tioiis of
sailing .md windsuiting instruction will be
ottered to Stanford students, meaning that
(>5O students will be able to get credit lot
time spent on 1 .agunit.i, at ((>rding to
I'etrucc i."
Bottom line: It always seems like the lake filled up
earlier last year, doesn't it?
