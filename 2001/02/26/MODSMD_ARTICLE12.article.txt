U.S. scientists have produced labo
ratory mice in which as much as a
quarter of the brain cells arc human, a
development that could carry great
promise Jor treating disease but poses
questions about the boundaries be
tween people and animals. The scien
tists are now considering a research
project to grow a mouse whose brain is
populated almost entirely with human
cells, but are worried by the ethics.
The research could lead to treat
ments for diseases such as Parkinson's,
Alzheimer's and stroke by regenerating
patients' brains with healthy cells.
The "chimaeric brain'' experiment,
carried out in California by In ing
Weissman of Stanford University with
colleagues from the Salk Institute and
Stem Cells Inc, a biotechnology compa
ny, showed that human brain cells can
flourish inside a mouse's skull.
