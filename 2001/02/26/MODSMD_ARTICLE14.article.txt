Stanford Nol)el laureates List week took a
leading role in public policy. fight members
of the Stanford facult\ were among SO laure
ates to sign .1 letter to President Hush urging
him not to blot k federal futuling for human
stem-cell research.
According to the National Institute of
I lealth, pluripotent stem cells, derived from
human embrvos, "give rise to almost all of
the cell types of the bod\, stub as muscle,
nerve, heart anil blood." For the past two
years, research in this area has been em
broiled m ethical and politic al debate.
Supporters stress potential medical bene
fits that, according to the \IH. include the
treatment of "Parkinson's disease, spinal
cord injury, stroke, burns, heart disease
[and] diabetes. ()pponcnts argue that use of
the c ells, obtained from spai e embryos slated
to be destroyed In fertilit\ c linic s, amounts to
killing living human beings. "112 nibrvonic

necessary." Senator Sam Krownb.uk. a
Kansas Republican, stated in Ihe boston

fhe lettei to Bush was prompted In the
approaching deadline ot ilic \lll foi pro
posals tor stem-cell research projects, the

first step in the appropriation of federal
funding to the research. Ihe approaching
deadline has intensified political debate on
the issue.
According to fhe Washington Post, the
new Health and Human Service's Secretan
I omm\ (flionipson is c urrenth "review

tli.it bush will sign an executive order bloc k
ing the funding before it begins."
In response, the laureates lettei stresses
the great potential of the field and the im
portance of federal support. " I he disco\er\
of human pluripotent stem tells is a signifi
cant milestone in medical research, federal
support for the enormous creativitx <>l the
I'.S. biomedical conimunit\ is essential to
translate this discoven into novel therapies

tractable diseases." the letter states.
