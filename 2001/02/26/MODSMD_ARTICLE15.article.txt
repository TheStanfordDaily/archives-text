wuli students, paicuts. community members and
t.tt ilit\ who luul conic to see ll.mil Kureishi's film,
M\ Son ihi' I .matic," and to ask questions ol the au
tlioi lot whom this was the last appearance ola bus's
two-da\ sta\ .it Stanford.
"I cannot explain the feeling ot reading oneself in
.1 novel loi the ver\ lirst time." Sameer Pandva, the
2001 South Asia Initiative leaching Fellow and a
doctoral candidate in Modern I bought and 1 litera
ture, s.iid m his introduction.
lie (Kureishi) takes his characters under his
wing and allows them moments ol grace and tran
scendent e ol the possibility 1 ollovc in a sometimes \ i
olent world." he continued.
In the IOOS film "M\ Son the Fanatic." the storv
ola Pakistani immigrant Vamilv living in Northern
Fngl.uid, Kureishi speaks through characters who
seek, and at times find. Sikh moments of grace and
transcendence, but who weave their lives through a
\ i» >leii( c m which the\ at times ( boose to participate.
" Flie film is about the tensions between a father
and.i son," Kureishi s.iid. "It is about ideology and
being di\ ided by belief."
()in I'uri pla\s Pane/, the father of the family
who drives .i taxi fora living to tlie dismay of his
wife, w ho is home alone while her husband drives
through the night. I heir only son, Farid, breaks off
Ins engagement to an English woman and turns to
radii.ll Islam in seari li of people who share his
(ulture.
I he shift is one that bis father, an areli
gious Muslim, does not understand, and the
film builds around the relationship and mis
understandings between the two characters.
Carve/ also develops a relationship with a
voting prostitute he has met in his taxi, a liai
son foi which Farid has no patience.
I he film, Kureishi s.iid, was inspired In his ob
servations of the neighborhood in Birmingham.
Fnglantl, shaied by Muslims and prostitutes. "W hat
bothered me," he s.iid. " was the hatred."
However, when an audience member asked
about the negative slant he felt the film took toward

Islam and the shallow representation of a deeply
complex religious tradition. Kureishi appealed to
the personal.
"M\ job as a yvritet is to have these voiies and to
let them have it out," he commented. "I know w ho I
prefer, though," he added, as laughtei swept
through the audience.
During a Friday lunch discussion with students
and ((immunity members ai ranged In \ isiting pro
fessor and chief organi/er l.inda Hess, Kureishi
adamantly insisted that, when he speaks, he speaks
onlv lot himself and from Ins own personal experi
ences. not as the voice ol the community or as an
Asian writer.
"1 am not a representative. 1 write what comes
from me," he said.
I hate identity . Ii bores me.' he said latei in the
conversation, which centered around questions of
identity and the writing in the South Asian Diaspo
ra. Kureishi does br<>.u h the issue of identity repeat
edly' throughout bis woi k. but rarely as a politic al oi
geographical issue. Instead, it becomes deeply per
sonal.
His response to Pandvas question about
the role of sexuality in Ins novels and tilnis is
emblematic of his approach to questions. "I
think ,i lot about bodies. We spend most of
our time looking at two things, i ai sand bod
ies .... Mv body was a brown body and the
other kids called me Taki. And so 1 started to
think about race."
"1 get up in the morning and write bet ausc I love
to write. I guess that is why Fin a writei Because I
love to tell stories." Kureishi said.
The evening began when Dr. Henry S.
Rowen, Stanford Business St liool professor
and co-director of the Asia Pacific Research
('.enter, welcomed the audience and thanked
the donors to the South Asia Initiative which
brought Kureishi to Stanford.
I lie initiative seeks to increase the numbei of
permanent and visiting faculty spei iali/ing in South
Asia, to increase the com se offei nigs on South Asia
and to produce signifit ant researi li on South Asia.
"1 am pleased at the wav [the initiative! has
evolved, particularly in terms of the cultural offer
ings that l.inda I less has brought to it, Rowen said.
