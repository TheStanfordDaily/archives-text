small plaque with the name ol the sculp

We live hi pi>liticallv-( orrect times and a
liberal-minded I niversit\ with educated
people. 1 he thought of aiiMliing like van

I'eople wouldn't do something like that.
Most people here wouldn't even sa\ anv

doesn't mean that tilings are perfect right
now. Hi.it doesn't mean tli.it the tight for

1 cannot tell von what it is like to Ix* in a
homosexual relationship. I do not know.
But I < an tell von that I undeistand when se
niot \nthon\ (iutierre/ talks about wanting
the same things am one wants w hen fighting
movements of injustice. I can tell \ou that I
understand about the need tor freedom,
love, lights. ix)liti( al powci and a voice.

I lungsare prettv good here at Stanford, he

more. People can tr\ to untlei stand.
" I he first step is to Ir.n li to einpatlli/c,"
(iutierre/ sa\s. "Ask these questions foi voin

I le didn't t hoosc his sexualitv. I hat was
given to him. I hat was a (iod-givcn gift, he
sa\s with a laugh. \\ hat he did ( hoose was
his iilentitv. And that is a ven enipowei ing

Irishman 1- mil Martinsek made that
t lion etluiing his senior vcar in high si liool.
Stanford, foi him, has been a much more
aicepting environment than Ohio, where
he grew up. But he si ill heat s things lie wish
es he ilidn't. I le still heai s people s.i\ things
like, "that's soooo gav." to tlest ribe things
the\ iliink are lame. I hev probabh don't
reali/e that it slums a kit k of tolerance.
"It's slightlv derogatorv." he savs. "It's
passed ott'asa laughing joke but it docsaftei t
us."
Overall, though, Martinsek has found
Stanford welcoming in his almost twoquai ters

We sht)iiltl come together. We are all
human. W'eall want toconnect.tolove, to be
heard and tt> have rights. We all share this.
lake a walk over tt) Segal's sculpture.
I akea few minutes from vourda\ and look
at the statues. I'hev are still sitting, still
standing there. I.t>ok .it the space next to
the two women. There's room on that
bench. I here's room for heterosexuals, ho
mosexuals. bisexuals and transsexuals.
There's room for Jews, Christians, Mus
lims. Buddhists; for whites, browns, reds,
vellows, blacks, for everyone. There's room
on the bench.
Scrum linan I 'uJc would law to hear what you
see on that walk You can e-mail him at
