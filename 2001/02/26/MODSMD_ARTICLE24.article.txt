## Cardinal shoots past Huskies 
### TIM KANE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
rhere are manv things you
ian I do when plaving Stanford.
And, as the Washington Huskies
found out Saturday night at
Maples Pavilion, there's one thing
vou reallv, reallv don't want to do.
Make |ason ('.ollins mad.
No, that's the wrong word.
Make Jason Collins upset.
()n the receiving end of a pairot
hard but dean fouls, (.ollins siinph
lipped Ins game to another level
against t lie Huskies, scoring a ca
reer-high .'W points on LS-of-14
shooting from the floor .is the No.
I Cardinal (25-1, 13-1 Pacific 10
Conference) downed W ashington
(9-18,3-12) 99-79 in front of a sell
out crowd.
"Jason Collins was spectacular
shooting the ball," s.ml Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery.
"I le's playing great basketball."
Hi is wasn't just an exhibition of
dominant post pla\ from the ju
nior 7-fboter, though. Far from it.
l .tking advantage of a small
lineup and defense that left him
wide open on the perimeter, dar
ing him to take the 3-pointer,
(-ollins did his best (.asev Jacobsen
impression as be made l-of-5 shots
from behind the arc.
l lie other parts of bis game
weren't too shabby either, as lie
tallied eight rebounds, four
steals, two blocks, zero turnovers
and five assists — with the excep
tion of the last, all team-leading
marks.

Of course, had it not been for
the fouls committed bv Washing
ton's Thalo Green and Bryan
Brown, who knows what would
have happened. Collins might not
have scored the most points bv a
Stanford plaver since Kris Weeins'
32 against the Huskies in 1998, or
tome within a single air-balled .3-
pointer (Ins final shot) of tving tlie
Pac-10 record for most shots with
out a miss.
"1 think he got a little upset be
cause of the bard fouls," Mont
gomery said. "1 had a sense that it
motivated him a little bit because
be started to turn it up."
Turn it up he did, and the rest
of Ins teammates were in awe of his
performance.
"Jason's perform.nice was in
credible," said lus brother, senior
forward Jarron Collins. "Kspecial
l\ after all the injui ies and adversi
ty lie's overcome."
" I o shoot that well is an amaz
ing accomplishment," said (acob
sen, who had 21 points of his own.
\nd he wasn't shooting from font
feet out — he was out at 20 ni<>st of
the time. 1 hat s prettv impressive."
Impressive enough to c lial
lenge the team champion in
11< )RSE
"If he does (want to challenge
me]." said |acobsen, "he'd better
bring Ins wallet."
I he notion of ( ollins» halleng
ing perhaps the countn's best
pure shooter to a contest, laugh
able at the beginning of the season,
suddenh isn't as much of a joke.
Collins is now the team's second

leading 3-poinr shooter (8-ot-lrt
on the season) behind point guard
Michael McDonald, who has hit
7 percent ot his threes, (lollins
has made six ot his lasi eight .3-
pointei s attempted.
With his ahilitv to shoot from
the perimeter becoming a bigger
part <>! the (Cardinal offense, teams
will now face an interesting dilem
ma when guarding (lollins.
Should the\ follow him to the out
side (o contest his shots and leave
the middle open, or lei hint bomb
awa\ from outside with wide-open
looks?
"When a 7-loout can stop and
hit it's scan what th.it
can add to .i team like Stanford,"
said W ashington head coach Bob
Bender.
Lost in all the talk of (lollins's
phenomenal night was the fact
that, for the fifth time in the last
seven games, the Cardinal al
lowed an opponent to shoot more
than 50 percent from the field.
Washington made .">1.7 percent
of its field goals, "w Inch lias to be
a little concern.' Montgomen
said.
Shooting f)2.U percent from the
field as a team, as the (.ardinal did,
will tend to in.ike a (oncern into a
footnote. ()n the bright side, the
effort thai was missing in most of
rhursda\'s win ovei Washington
State was back in full force. |ason
(lollins, among others, lut the floor
on different oc (asions tr\ ing to 1 e
cover loose balls, even with the
game alreach dec ided 111 the sec -
ond halt".

Overall, the defense harassed
the Huskies into making 13
turnovers.
"After I hursdav's perfor
mance, and how bad it was, you
had to expect more from us." said
Jacobsen. "We're too talented and
we're too tough of a group not to
double our effort."
