SKAITKK, W ash.— I lie Stan
ford women's basketball team
matched two Pacific 10 ('onlcrence
records in Saturday s game against
Washington. But the ( animal
would easily forgo the plate in the
record books for an extra talk in the
win column.
Despite Stanford's record-tving
If) S-pointers, including junior
Kindsev Vamasaki s individual
record-tving nine, the Cardinal
came up short, falling to the
I luskies 95-87 in Seattle. I he team
learned the hard wa\ that there is a
lot more to a solid game than good
shooting.
"We shot well from tlu- out
side, but we never established an
inside game and didn't do a good
job on the boards, and that's what
hurt us," said head coach l at a
VanDerveer.
The Cardinal leads the Pac-10 in
rebounding differential but lias
been beaten on the boards in its last
two losses. Ihe Huskies out-re
bounded Stanford 49-.'H>. with se
nior IjeAnn Sheets and freshman
(>iuliana Mcndiola pullingdown IS
and 12 rebounds, respectivelv, for
Washington.
" The game was won in boards,"
VanDerveer said. " fhe\ rebound
ed really well, and we didn't. I hat
reallv determined the- game."
Sheets and fellow senior Megan
Kranza exhibited the senior lead
ership they have demonstrated all

year, serving as dependable fore es
for W ashington down the stretch.
I ; ran/a had a team-high 21 points,
while Sheets tallied a double-dou
ble, adding 12 points.
I he seniors weren't the only
ones that came up big for the
I luskies. Both Mcndiola and fellow
freshman Andrea Lilum showed
poise and maturity' In hitting criti
cal free throws m the closing min
utes, preventing the (.ardinal from
regaining the lead.
While the Huskies mounted a
controlled team-effort, Stanford
struggled to get into a steady flow.
Both Vamasaki and freshman
Nicole Powell had big afternoons
foi the ('.ardinal, but the rest of the
team seemed lackadaisical and out
of sync.
Powell led the Stanford charge
in the first half, going l-fbr-5 from
bevond the arc and helping the
Cardinal to open up with a 11 -'M
half-time lead. I lie freshman
wasn't the only one hitting her
threes, as the squad went a com
bined 9-fbr-l 1 in the first half.
" I lie\ were draining threes like
crazy," said Washington's Sheets.
"But at half, we weren't even down
by that much. I hat was a good feel
ing for us."
Washington adjusted its defense
slightly iu the second half, and,
while Stanford continued to hit the
consistent shot, the Huskies
stepped up then game.
Down bv'eight with 12 minutes to
play. Kranza aucl Mcndiola ignited
for the Huskies, scoring 12 points

ova the next three and a half min
utes and giving the Huskies their
lirst lead since earh in the first half.
While Yamasaki eontituied to hit
the threes, en route to liet career
high 34-point performance, Wash
ington answered every basket with
a field goal at the other end of the
floor.
An eight-point Washington
spurt led In a Mendiola free throw
put the I luskies up by six with two
minutes remaining. Washington
ultimately destroyed the Cardinal
at the free-throw line, .is Stanford
was forced to foul to get the ball
back.
" 1 hat was the most exciting
game I have ever been a part of,"
said Washington head coach June
Daughertv, who recorded her
'JOOth win in the contest.
"What .» great college game.
Moth teams plaved so well. It was
just back and forth. They just kept
hitting the big shots, but we didn't
get out of ourselves or get out of the
svstem. We just kept working the
basketball and letting the game
come to us," Daughertv said.
Saturday's game was critical for
both the I luskies and the (lardinal,
who stand at second and third in
the conference, respectively.
With the win, the Huskies re
main only a half a game behind con
ference-leading Arizona State, and,
with each game thev are becoming
.1 realistic prospect for the NCAA
tournament.
Meanwhile, Stanford is running
out of time to prove it self to the se

lection committee. The Cardinal is
currently a 112 ull two games out of the
conference lead and the automatic
tournament bid.
With four games remaining, in
( hiding a tough road trip down to
Arizona and Arizona State, it is es
sential that Stanford records some
qiialitv wins in the final weeks of
conference plav.

I he seniors weren't the only
ones that came up big for the
I luskies. Both Mcndiola and fellow
freshman Andrea Lilum showed
poise and maturity' In hitting criti
cal free throws m the closing min

regaining the lead.
While the Huskies mounted a
controlled team-effort, Stanford
struggled to get into a steady flow.
Both Vamasaki and freshman
Nicole Powell had big afternoons
foi the ('.ardinal, but the rest of the
team seemed lackadaisical and out
of sync.
Powell led the Stanford charge
in the first half, going l-fbr-5 from
bevond the arc and helping the
Cardinal to open up with a 11 -'M
half-time lead. I lie freshman
wasn't the only one hitting her
threes, as the squad went a com
bined 9-fbr-l 1 in the first half.
" I lie\ were draining threes like
crazy," said Washington's Sheets.
"But at half, we weren't even down
by that much. I hat was a good feel
ing for us."
Washington adjusted its defense
slightly iu the second half, and,
while Stanford continued to hit the
consistent shot, the Huskies
stepped up then game.
Down bv'eight with 12 minutes to
play. Kranza aucl Mcndiola ignited
for the Huskies, scoring 12 points

ova the next three and a half min
utes and giving the Huskies their
lirst lead since earh in the first half.
While Yamasaki eontituied to hit
the threes, en route to liet career
high 34-point performance, Wash
ington answered every basket with
a field goal at the other end of the
floor.
An eight-point Washington
spurt led In a Mendiola free throw
put the I luskies up by six with two
minutes remaining. Washington
ultimately destroyed the Cardinal
at the free-throw line, .is Stanford
was forced to foul to get the ball
back.
" 1 hat was the most exciting
game I have ever been a part of,"
said Washington head coach June
Daughertv, who recorded her
'JOOth win in the contest.
"What .» great college game.
Moth teams plaved so well. It was
just back and forth. They just kept
hitting the big shots, but we didn't
get out of ourselves or get out of the
svstem. We just kept working the
basketball and letting the game
come to us," Daughertv said.
Saturday's game was critical for
both the I luskies and the (lardinal,
who stand at second and third in
the conference, respectively.
With the win, the Huskies re
main only a half a game behind con
ference-leading Arizona State, and,
with each game thev are becoming
.1 realistic prospect for the NCAA
tournament.
Meanwhile, Stanford is running
out of time to prove it self to the se

lection committee. The Cardinal is
currently a 112 ull two games out of the
conference lead and the automatic
tournament bid.
With four games remaining, in
( hiding a tough road trip down to
Arizona and Arizona State, it is es
sential that Stanford records some
qiialitv wins in the final weeks of
conference plav.
