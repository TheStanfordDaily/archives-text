### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Baseball games tli.it last « >lll\ two and
a half hours are the first sign of dominant
pitching performances.
That said, games aren't lasting too
long for the (Cardinal these da\s.
junior Jefl Bwiksch (H-0) proved this
point at Sunken Diamond yesterday
when he pitched a three-hit complete

game shutout in .m K-0 victory over
Santa ( Lira tli.it lasted well under three
hours. I lie win sealed the 11th consecu
tive series victon for the No. 9 Cardinal.
Stanford (I 1-4) won both of its games
against the Broncos (2-10) this weekend
behind solid |>it< lung performances. The
third game will be played tonight at
Santa Clara's Buck Shaw Stadium be
cause the second game of the series was
postponed due to inclement weather.

Bruksch, who has now pitched an eye
opening 17 l/.S consecutive scoreless in
nings, grabbed his first complete-game
shutout of his collegiate career to extend
the Cardinal winning streak against the
Broncos to 17 games, dating back to the
1997 season.
"He had good command of every
thing, and it was a great performance,"
said head coach Mark Marquess.
Bruksch struck out a career-high nine

batters to increase his team-leading
strikeout total to 'M. I lc allowed doubles
early in the fifth, sixth and seventh in
nings. but made e.is\ wot k out of the fol
lowing Bronco batters.
After struggling earlier this vcar In
giving up seven runs in the Cardinal's
11-9 loss to Fresno State, Bruksch now
feels that he has become tnoi e confident
on the mound.
"I'm reallv comfortable out there

now. I think I made it too complicated
the first couple of weeks, and [now] 1
think I've simplified the game." Bruksch
said. "[l've] narrowed mv focus to the
task at hand, to focus on eat h pitt hand
not to look at the big picture."
