which took place at lovon flail
Pel). 17. As the third ad of the
night, the liaiul introduced a dif
ferent genre of music to the
evening: hip-hop.
"We specialize in hip-hop
music. which is <m Afro-centric ait
form founded in an urban envi
ronment," said sophomore
D.unon Jones, a meinbei and
Ibundct of the group. "Hip-hop,
however, is delineated from pre
i eding forms of Afro-t entric music
|likc] funk, rock and roll, rhvthin
and blues, blues. ja//, gospel, spit 1-
tti.ils and the drum, to name a few .
So these st\les naturalK find theii
wav into our mix.

Admit Weekend to a packed Si.in
fold ( oflec House, filled with
prospective freshmen and Stan

"[ I lie show w.is| sort of .111 ex

Drake, o.n.e. s pianist, "but after
tli.it show I knew we were for real.
I s.iw .1 band stai ting to take- shape.
1 remember being so sui prised not
only that we had been able to
achieve the feeling of .1 group so
quickly, but that we were doing
something unique foi the Stanford
communitv."
A goal of o.n.e. is to communi
cate .1 positive message to its audi

jectification of women, which is
often expressed in much oftoda\'s
contemporary rap, according to
band members.

Members of the new hip-hop band on e. say they try to communicate a pos
itive message. The group won the Battle of the Bands, Phi Kappa Psi's yearly
contest of local music.
"We are the antithesis of popular
rap." said sophomore Matt Brewer,
one of tlit' group's Ivrieists. "At .in
o.n.e. slum, von will hear respect
coming through the speaker. Sou
w ill hear lvrirs that oftentimes coin
hat i .k ism, sexism and the manifold
foi ins of oppression. We all attempt
i<» integrate social and political con
st iousness into our songs."
Kails agree that the band does
demonstrate a positive message bv
i hallcnging listeners to re-evaluate
their thoughts about and under
standings of popular music.
"W hen vou listen to their lvrics.

I mean actualiv listen aside from
the tight heats and vocals." said
sophomore Kva I nioli, "the\ .u tu
allv cause vou to reflect and ques
tion certain issues. For example,
thev have a song that essentialh
tells the audience to think [before]
calling a woman a bitch. I he\ sav,
Is that a bitch? Is that vour sister?
Is that your mother?' Since [o.n.e.'s
son); is] a plav-off of a verv popular
song, it also urges vou to question
popular entertainment."
I lie band thinks that hip-hop is
verv effective in challenging nega
tive elements of contemporaiA
societv.
"Hip-hop is one of the most
powerful means of communicating
frustration with many things in the
world todav," Jones said.
