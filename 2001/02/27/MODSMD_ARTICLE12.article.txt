On Feb. L' 7, IDOO, I lie l)ail\ printed ail article
about the I niversitv's admissions process.
"()u top of mountains of paperwoi L endless in
terviews, const.int parental harassment and tight
deadlines. Stanford [admissions] officials must fend
off the almost savage (onipetition of the 9,000 appli
cants foi 1,400 places in next fall's ft esliman ( lass.
"I'ost-admissions problems are often (jinte seri
ous. In one case, a distraught mother confronted
[former admissions diret toi Rexford| Snvdei in Ins
office, moaning repeatedlv, 'You tinned down in\
danghtei With each passing moment, the woman's
complaints grew louder and louder, until she pulled
a gun from her purse and trained ii on the startled
director. Suvder sat petrified foi several minutes,
but finalh managed to wrest the revolver aw a\."
Bottom line: It seems like the admissions process gets tougher
every year.
