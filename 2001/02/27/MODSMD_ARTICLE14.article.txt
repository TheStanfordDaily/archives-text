From dav one <>l then college farcers,
Stanford students are inundated with advice

Some peer advisers worn that not enough
students know of their existence or utilize
their sen it cs enough.
"I would like to see more integration be
tween the nuliv itlual departmental peer atlv is
ing programs and the I AC.," saitl senior
IMiilip l.ipscv, a peer adviser in the Interna
tional Relations Department. "1 think we can
ansvvci questions about the major more etlec
tivclv than AAs. but coordination seems to be
prettv rare."
Senior Marje Soova, another international
relations peer adviser saitl, "Peer advising is
|vet| anothei potentiallv verv beneficial re
source that students don't take enough ad
vantage of."
I o combat this problem, some peer advis
ing programs have tried to make their exis
tent e bettei known.
'We've started a big advertising campaign
this t{n.u tci to lei people know that we exist, and
that we have drop-in office hours." saitl senior
psvchologv adviset /at ban Dillon. "It's a small
program right now, but it's growing."
Manv students who have made use ot the
peei advising svstem sav tliev have found the
atlv isers helpful.
Scnioi long laii. a human hiologv major,
saitl that she, like- most students in the-1 luman
biologv I'rogr.un, has consulted the depart
ment's stiicle-iit advisers once or twice a vear.

Liu said that the advisers were particularly
helpful in figuring out how "to declare and
finish fulfilling my requirements for m\
major."
However, a luuultul ot students who have
turned to peer advisers did not benefit as
much.
"The peei adviser 1 had for economics was
a real moron," junior Jonathan Dunn said.
"He tried reallv hard to set up things, hut he
just didn't have the know ledge 01 information
1 needed."
"1 le seemed to be doing it more tor the re
sume-builder and less to help students out,"
Dunn added.
Other students, though aware ot the exis
tence ot peer advisers, say the\ have never
found the need to go to them.
"The reason 1 didn't use them is because
the actual adult advisers employees in the 1R
office are so helpful," junior Kenneth (iarrett
said. "1 never felt like 1 had to go to anvbod\
else."
()ther departments do not have peer advis
ing programs, either because of the small
number of students within the major oi a lack
of interest.
"The main reason [we don't have peer ad
visers] is that the number of majors is ex
tremelv small, which means that individual
students don't have to compete for the atten
tion ot faculty members, explained |im Re
uben, the undergraduate adviser in the
Jaj xuiese Department.
