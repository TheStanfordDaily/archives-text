HI I.I.MRK: BRIMSTONE! I ill
cud of oui democracv! Students
passing through White I'la/a have
probabh received <i sermon on the
above topu s (and more) from the aggressive in
dividuals and groups who transform the ( rowd
ed stretch into their personal soapboxes each
day.
I he First Amendment and its guaranteed
freedoms are valuable, but the situation in
White I'la/a has reached an uncomfortable
level. We believe that these individuals, gr<ming
more fanatical with each newh discovered Nos
tradainus prediction and adjudicated Supreme
Court decision, should be monitored b\ the
I niversitx for the protection of its students and
visitors.
Our concern arises not from the open ex
pression of opinions, but from the aggressive
behavior we have notit ed from the members of

some of the groups in White I'la/a. W'e recog
ni/e that the area is a c< mini unit \ spat e. and we
encourage groups to use it as a place to connect
with students, but students, stafl and f.u ult\
should not feel harassed when walking through
tlu' area.
Stanford and its land are private proper!v.
I hcrefore, we question I he rights of these in
dividuals and groups to be on tampus ai all
Stanford, closed to the press and media with
out the proper clearance, should inoniioi lis
conmiunitx span's. ( ainpus grounds should
remain a place where students t an move fteel\
without worrying about unwarranted inlet
ruption and especialh where personal prole<
tion is guaranteed. I liese rights should also in
dude safe, comfortable travel to and from
( lass.
