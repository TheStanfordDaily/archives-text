### 
H' .111 k Adams. ( l.iss <>1 I IMi-l.
passed awav last W'ednesda\
after a long battle with cancer.
Most ot vou probablv never
met him. but he was responsible loi stal l
ing .1 musical traclition .it Stanford that has
touched almost even one of vou at some
point in voui college c areer.
1 met I lank during the second week of
tn\ freshman vear, at mv audition foi the
a cappella group that I would soon join.
Nervoush clutching the piece of papei

that told nit* where to
go. 1 showed up and
itinnediatel\ thought
that I was in the wrong
plate. I could hear
singing neail)\. hut the
room 1 had |ust walked
into was full <>t old gu\s,
milling around, t.ilking
and laughing.
Hank walked right

up to me. greeting me with a warm smile
and an enthusiastic handshake. He intro
duced himselt as one of the group's alum
ni. helped me go over niv music a few
times .md wished me the best ol luck as 1
was whisked awa\ into the next room tor
niv audition. I lank was one ol those peo
ple who made von leel good about who
vou were.
Later that year, during breaks in re
hearsal, I learned that Hank started the
first a cappella group at Stanford w hen lie
transferred from Yale and brought the
tradition of Kast (.oast collegiate singing to
California. In 19M, he collaborated with
two other undergi aduates who shared his
vision, and the Stanford Mendicants was
born.
I hirtv-eight vears later. Hank still at
tended f.ill auditions, showed up at all the
big pcrfonnanc es. was available for advice
and guidance and invited us to st.i\ in his
home as part of our f.ill retreat.
Even though he was no longer singing
with the group or attending Stanford,
I lank woi ked hard to sta\ involved b\ act
ing .is the group s most trusted mentor
and biggest fan.
I he news of I Link's death hit me hard.
I had onlv spoken to the man a handful of
times, vet I felt as it I'd lost something

decpl\ import.ml to inc.
I thought ahout wh\ the passing of a
man I hardh knew affec ted 111 c so nine h. I
(I lit ik Hank's legacy reached fnrihei than
auvone. even I lank himself, i eali/ed.
Hank had a love of music It was the gift
that he wanted to share with the people
around him. B\ starting the til st a c appel
la group at Stanford, he managed t»> share
it with an astounding numbei ol people.
Since I '.MM. hunch eds of Stanfoicl men ot
all walks of life have joined the group foi
the love of singing, and the\ have found
that some ol then most ( herishecl memo
ries and important friendships have
sprung from the experience.
But Hank's gift wasn't onl\ foi those
who sang in the group. It was l<n anxoue
who loved iniisii. anvone who smiled dur
ing tlu- annual Admit Weekend show and
anvone who received a Valentine's l)a\
serenade. Aftei US \eais" wmth of pel t<>i -
mantes and serenades, this has added up
to a lot of people.
What Hank brought to the school
when he founded the Mendicants has
since become an integral part of the
Stanford experience. I oclav. we have
eight a cappella groups on campus,
each with its own stvle and its own
unique personalis.
Hanks interest and support in the
group never waned, even w hen lie- discov
ered that he was sick. I remcnibci how
happ\ he was to attend one of oui ic
hcarsals last winter. He looked much
more tired than I'd ever seen him. but his
visit that dav seemed to make him forget
his illness and lift his spirit. Seeing him
there lifted out spirits as well. I wish that
all alumni could plav as important a part
in Stanford's student life as Hank did iu
mine.
1 went to I lank s sen ices this past week
end. flic house was packed. Mendicants
past and present c ame from all around to
sa\ their good-bves. We sang for him, one
last time. It was our wa\ of thanking him
for evervthing that he gave us.

ries and important friendships have
sprung from the experience.
But Hank's gift wasn't onl\ foi those
who sang in the group. It was l<n anxoue
who loved iniisii. anvone who smiled dur
ing tlu- annual Admit Weekend show and
anvone who received a Valentine's l)a\
serenade. Aftei US \eais" wmth of pel t<>i -
mantes and serenades, this has added up
to a lot of people.
What Hank brought to the school
when he founded the Mendicants has
since become an integral part of the
Stanford experience. I oclav. we have
eight a cappella groups on campus,
each with its own stvle and its own
unique personalis.
Hanks interest and support in the
group never waned, even w hen lie- discov
ered that he was sick. I remcnibci how
happ\ he was to attend one of oui ic
hcarsals last winter. He looked much
more tired than I'd ever seen him. but his
visit that dav seemed to make him forget
his illness and lift his spirit. Seeing him
there lifted out spirits as well. I wish that
all alumni could plav as important a part
in Stanford's student life as Hank did iu
mine.
1 went to I lank s sen ices this past week
end. flic house was packed. Mendicants
past and present c ame from all around to
sa\ their good-bves. We sang for him, one
last time. It was our wa\ of thanking him
for evervthing that he gave us.
