# Stanford's Sixth Man should cheer like No. 1 fans
## Fans must unite, intensify in support of Cardinal men's basketball 
### 
There is .1 rli.ml, though rarelv
used In the fans <>l the \<>. I
college basketball team, that
dest ribes Stanford's Sixth Man
(Hub: "Ovenaled! (<'hif> fhi/f t'ltip) Over
rated!"
I he Sixth Man C.lub is sureh not
lackadaisical. but it tould be so much
more energetic.
"You're ( razv!" von max veil at this col
umn. along with other profane com-

ments. But if you are
that passionate and de
fensive of Sixth Man
(Hubs reputation, this
(olunin does not applv
to VOII.
Though there is a
mvth that the Sixth
Man (Hub rivals Duke's
student section as the

best student fans 111 college basketball,
that notion is indeed only a myth.
While Duke may have its Cameron
Cra/ies. Maples surely cannot claim to
have such maniacs.
Sure, the Sixth Man Club is a witty,
rowdv and hostile crowd at times, which

provides fora great collegiate basketball
atmosphere.
No denving that here.
Classic chants — like "foul No. 4!" (in
response to New Mexico senior VVavland
White's six straight missed free throws),
"who let the dogs out?" (mocking the Cal
cheerleaders), "oompa loom pa!" (about
diminutive I SC point guard Brandon
Cranville) and "your son hates you!" (di
rected at USC coach Henrv Bibby's es
trangement frotn his son, Vancouver
Grizzlies guard Mike) — have added to
the Sixth Man Club's lore and viciousness.
But imagine how intense and intimi
dating these chants would be in unison.
There are patches within the Sixth

Man section that represent what all other
fans should strive towards — the die
hards who camp out before games, the
fanatics with face paint and red-and
white wigs, the "he< kling corner" to the
right of the band and the students who
constanth veil and jump up and down to
the point of dehvdration like pogo stu ks.
But imagine how deafening Maples
could be if the whole Sixth Man section
had half the intensitv as tlu sc die-hards.
So. to the Sixth Man members who
don't veil, don't cheer, don't ( are and
just come to the games to socialize, this
column is direc ted at \ou.
Mavbe this apatln tould have been ,u -
cepted when Stanford was on the fringe s

of the men's college basketball s( ene. but
it is unacceptable w hen head < oat h Mike
Montgonien has built a perennial na
tional < hampionslup < ontender.
It is .i shame that the Sixth Man ( Hub
(.in be a front-running crowd that
screams loudlv when Stanford is up l>\
.St) but bee onus silen* when the Cardinal
is trailing oi sti uggling.
Instead of representing what the
Sixth Man Club should stand for — the
spai k plug that enet gizes the team — it
seems that the Sixth Man is more like the
Ninth Man who comes in and mops up
dm ing garbage time.
