I IC. pitcher Ron Con/ales-Could

ed out in line with the weekend's theme
— a two-run home run in the top of the
fii st inning, this time thanks to Beeson.
However, the ('.ardinal received its
fii si answer of the toui nainent when the
I'irates posted mo runs of their own itn

three-run home i un.
1 'his was the onl\ point in the toui ila

I be ( artlmal luts supplied what was
needed, producing 12 runs in the next
live innings of plav. Beeson put the Car
tlinal bat k m the running when slit- tied
the game with her own tlnee-run home
run in the third. Stanford then reintort etl
its presence when senior |enni Shitleler,
freshman Jessica Allister and Branghani
ripped three consecutive doubles in the
tburth. The rallv did not end there, as
freshman Michelle I hirv and junioi
Robin Walker both hit sac rifice flies, and
Mendo/a and Beeson each singled in an
eflort that sent the I'irate pitcher to the
dugout.
I be- ( ardinal posted the last of its 11
runs in the top of the sixth on a leatlofl
double b\ 1 bin and a pair of RBI In

and it went on to win its fourth game of
the tournament.
I he Cardinal's final complete game
in Georgia led to a 0-4 victorv over
Kansas. Stanford scored six runs be
fore being challenged, as the squad
notched bit aftei bit, iuc hiding a three
run blast from Shitleler, her first home
i mi of the season.
Stanford's run was interrupted
when the (lardinal defense allowed tbe
]a\hawks to score two unearned inns
in the fourth. Kansas added two more
runs, one in the fifth and one in the
sixth, but this would not prove enough
to beat Stanford.
I"he Cardinal, riding on an unde
