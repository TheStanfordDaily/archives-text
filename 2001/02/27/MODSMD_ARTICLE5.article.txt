I lie- cjuestion ot whether Stan
ford has the means and can c hoose
to match Princeton's polio re
mains cc implex and imolves sever
al levels of input, ranging from the
Board ot Trustees to Stanford's
main donors. Some would argue
that the answer lies in the seman
tics of the financial aid packages
themselves.
I he c lassic financial aid pack
age awarded at most universities
breaks down into a combination of
three sources of aid — loans, out
of-pocket contributions and
grants. Princeton lias eliminated
loans In supplementing them with
grants. Students still have the op
tion of borrowing if they wish to
pa\ a portion ot out-of-pocket
costs with loans. Harvard and
Stanford have reduced self-help
expectations, which means thev
will ask students to borrow less and
conti ibute less out-of-pocket.
"Princeton is still expecting that
students will work din ing the vear
to meet a portion of their costs,"

said ( vnthia Hartley, Stanford's
director of Financial Aid Policy,
Planning & Analysis. "They are
not meeting full need with grant
aid onl\. as some seem to think."
Hartle\ added that some Stan
ford students prefer to borrow it it
means the\ can contribute less
out-of-pocket.
She also commented, "It Stan
ford's financial aid policy were to
mimic Princeton's, some students
would receive up to approximate
ly $3,000 more in grant aid."
"In principle, I think [replacing
loans with grants] is a good idea, as
li >ng as the cost [to the University]
doesn't change the overall quality
ot a Stanford education," junior
\aotni ( hin said. "Its verv impor
tant that we admit people regard
less of their economic constraints,
but we somehow have to strike a
balance."

an\ possible c lunges to Stanford's

aid policies usually get proposed
in autumn and are implemented
for the next academic ve.tr.
While administrators at all
peer institutions are disinc lined to
acknowledge strategi/ing and
outright competition among fi
nancial aid policies, recent deci
sions are nonetheless promising
tor undergraduates who are in
need of aid.
"We had not hoped fora com
petitive advantage here," Prince
ton I niversitx President Harold
1. Shapiro said in the Daily
Princetonian. "What we hoped
for is what we did would be fol
lowed In our competitors so th.it
education as a whole would be
open. After all, Princeton isonh a
small group ot students."
