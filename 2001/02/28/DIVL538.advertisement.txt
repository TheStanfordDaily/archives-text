Art Alcove
Memories of Our Future
confronts the deep resistance
to change of any kind in the
Mediterranean region and
describes endeavors to help
break down barriers between
peoples, nations and languages.
"Unlike many contemporary literary
theoreticians, Alcalay is profoundly alive
to the social and political realities
that shape cultural production."
--Amitav Ghosh
