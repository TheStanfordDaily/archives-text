Dear Members of the Stanford Community:
The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching
is disturbed by the inflammatory statements made recently
about its proposed think tank on Stanford lands. Ihe
Foundation believes that these statements, made by the
Committee for Green Foothills, are contrary to fact and law.
Careful reading of the Committee's recent press release
makes it clear that the Committee simply rejects the
considered conclusions of the County and prefers its own.
Unfortunately, these tactics are not unlike those that have been used in the past to
undercut rational and objective decisions by the public and by our elected
officials. The Carnegie Foundation has a lot of faith in the people at Stanford and
in the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors. We believe when the 1 AC IS are
heard, the Stanford community and the Board of Supervisors will agree that this
is a legal and necessary project that helps address one of our greatest needs today
- improving teacher quality.
We ask the faculty, students and staff of Stanford to be patient and not to come to
conclusions on the basis of campaign tactics exercised by the Committee tor Green
Foothills. We have for over two years provided accurate information to the
County, and in the near future, the Foundation will share with the Stanford
community and the larger community accurate information about the project, and
you can then make your own objective decision as to the relative accuracy and
merits of the position of the Foundation versus that of the C ommittee.
Sincerely,
Lee S. Shulman
