()n I V!). 28, 1930, The Dailv printed an article
about .1 graduate student who developed .i new
method (»1 making paper.
" I tili/ing materials heretofore regarded as waste,
( arlvle Harmon, a graduate student working in
( hemical research, has developed a method of mak
ing paper and wall-hoard from the hark and waste
slabs of redwood which were formerly hurnt .it the
lumber mills in order to dispose of them.
" 'In logging operations, approximated 50 per
cent ot the redwood tree is left in the forest and 30
pen cut ol the logs taken to the mill is wasted,' 1 lar
mon s.iid vesterdav in an interview with tlie Dailv.
' I lu- process was originallv conceived as a means to
prevent the terrible waste which has prevailed in
veai s past. It is directlv in line with the national poli

Bottom line: Environmentalism is nothing new at Stanford.
