"1 had .1 feeling." Lyons said,
explaining one ol the motives for
the award, "that the I niversitv was
not aware of how rich our commu
nity was and the opportunities
available to reach out and serve."
I niversit\ President Lmeritus
Donald Kenned) (1980-1992),
who made public service initiatives
a central part ot bis presidency,
agreed that the award was intend
ed to help make community ser
vice a more visible element on
campus.
Booker and Walker said that,
looking back, receiving the Lyons
award was an honor and one of the
most significant events of their
Stanlord experience. They stress
that their service .is undergradu
ates greatly intluenced their career
paths.
"Working in that inner city
community led directly to what
I'm doing now." said Booker ol his
time in East Palo Alto. "It ignited
my passions to be directly involved
with a community in struggle that
was still li ving to achieve lor itsell

the promise ol the American
dream."
Booker went on to get a mas

"If you roll up vour sleeves and
go into neighborhoods, people
tell vou not to go into," he told
I ime magazine, "you can make a
difference."
Walker, who grew up 111 Last
Liberty. Pittsburgh, a low-income
neighborhood, pointed out that
Ins b.K kground and exposure to
Last Palo Alto gave him the tools to
relate to people Irom low-income
communities and to understand
w hat ma\ have led them to commit
crimes.
Aftei completing bis law de
gree at Stanford 111 1999, Walkei
married Mailee I'ergeson, a lel
low winner ol the Lvons, and

Associate Professor ol Art 11 isto
rv and C 'lassies Jodv Maxmin nom
inated both Bookei and Walker
and lias recommended a student
for the Lvons nearly every year.
She s.nd the two men inspired her,
and it turns out the leeling was
mutual.
"She was one ol the most amaz
ing teac hers I've ever had," Book
ei said. "She brought alive the sub
ject and aliened niv view on tlie
world."
Maxmin stavs 111 touch with her
nominees and keeps close tabs on
their accomplishments. And, al
though years have passed, she eas
ily recalls some of the other ac tivi
ties Booker and Walker participat

" 1 here is a tendency as vou get
older to think about leathering
vour own nest, tending your own
garden, looking altei \oin own
family,'" she said. "Ibis h.ibit
\oung people are getting into ol
helping others while getting then
education is a wonderful diversit\
with a personalis .To be able to do
a lot of things at once — that I
think is a ver\ Stanford thing, a
ven Dean Lvons kind of thing."
Lyons explained tb.it the award
was designed sinipK so tb.it its
meaning — a thank vou for selfless
service — would not be lost. I lie
tvpe of service that qualified was
not specified, and no mone\ was

"It was a wondci lul mix," Lyons
said, "('.an \ou think of a better in
gredient fora nice dinner partv?
F.vervone there tt*ll good about it.
Since 101)0, the onb change in

In contrast to the bum's award,
