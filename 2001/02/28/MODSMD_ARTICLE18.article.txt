Published Since IS') I

MAW S I t Dl \I S W ILL agree
that it is not eas\ i<> stir up interest
in political ,tiid social issues at Stan
ford. I his does not mean, however,
that enthusiastic student gioups are not li ving.
In light of the recent < ampaigning on the I ni
versitv's medical waste disposal and Monda\
night's leach in. "Lconoiiiie boom l<>i W hoin,
we commend Students foi Lnvironniental Ac
lion at Stanford, an orgam/ation f<»i mk ial and
environmental justice-, mi their eflorts to edu
cate (he student I»«»«1 \on issues concerning en
vironmental justice .ind lo demand change
through p< >litic alac ti\ ism.
Si-.AS lias made consistent efforts to educate
students on issue's faced In ihe larger commuui
tv outside of Stanford. SI AS continues to raise
awareness on the harsh realities of life for some in
Silicon Yallcv. Monda\ night. SL \S held a leac li
in about laboi injustices and the housing < i isis in

Silicon V.illev, bringing in speakers from 1)1-
IU (p. .in organi/ation of young assembh and
manufacturing workers in Silicon Vallev, and die
( ommunit\ I lomeless Alliance Minisirv.
SI .AS also pairs education wit 11 political ac
tion. SI .AS is one ol the lew activist groups on
campus that aims to hold Stanford account
able to the larger communilv. Although Staii
fbrd operates as an independent institution,
the choices that tlie I niversit\ makes often
greatl\ affect the cjualitv of life for mam I»a\
Area residents.
Stanford's medical waste disposal is one ex
ample <>l this influence. Recentlv, SLAS ,ind
I'l I HI .O.aconiniunitv group in Last Oakland,
have campaigned for Stanford I lospital to stop
incinerating waste in Kast Oakland, a low-in
conie miuoritv comtnunitv. SLAS li.is shown
great pet sistenc e in mounting this campaign.
I nlikc other activist groups on campus.

SI AS has not limited itself to more traditional
foi ins of student protest, like- teat h-ins and ral
lies. Sl .AS has encouraged innovation and orig
inalit\ because the group is unafraid to chal
lenge the wa\ s m which it protests.
During fall quarter, in the lasi rallv of their
medical waste c ampaign, SI.AS opened the
event with a theati ical performance about the
fight for justice in Last Oakland. In the skit,
ac tors we >re colorful masks and used towering
puppets to address the audience. SL.AS has
tried to incorporate fine arts into its activism,
gi\ ing students (lie opportunitv to take a cre
.itive politic alstanc e through tlieii talents and
skills.
lo set iiself apart from other activist groups,
SI.AS does not forget that those who are in
volved in siudeui activism are mainlv voting
people with fresh ideas. While other activist
groups nia\ sii ive lo c ultivate a more proles-

sional demeanor, SI .AS has used «i somewhat
playful approach to political activism. Horn
frequent weekend SKAS retreats to papier
mache puppet theater, SKAS serves as a re
minder to tlie Stanford activist coniniunitv that
humor and creativity, coupled with strategic
planning and education, are essential parts of
political action.
As these eflorts demonstrate, SKAS is a stu
dent activist group that is effective, consistent
and inventive. It is this favorable reputation that
has turned the organization into a cornerstone
of student political activism .it Stanford, with
vounger activist groups looking towards SKAS
for guidance and resources. Indeed, SKAS is an
inspiring example of the great potential of stu
dent ac tivism on the Stanford c ampus, showing
that the voices of concerned students can he
heard if tliev have the courage to come togeth
er and take a stand.
