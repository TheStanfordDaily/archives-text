Security, free speech important
I wanted to respond to your Feb. L' 7 ed
itorial. "Wbite Pla/a speakeis often t<h» ag
grcssiw." As a senio* I lia\e witnessed
more than a few aggressive speakers 111
White I'la/a. I hex have ranged tro.v en
tertaining, to obnoxious, to — as von point
ed out — intimidating.
I w holeheai ledb agree that Stanford
must ensure the salet\ ol students, stall,
fiu ult\ and others who tome to our eani
pus. I he First Amendment protects the
i iglu of spect h. not the right to phvsicalh
fori e that speei li on othei s. Anil ii would
Ik* a dangerous step loi the I niversit\ to
ignore real publii safet\ 10111 erns in favor
ola misguided application ol constitu
tional principles. Stanford should be vigi
lant in enforcing existing laws and ordi
nances that prohibit physical abuse and
intimidation.
I fowever, 1 was a bit taken aback In voui
assertion that, Ixrause Stanford is private
propert\. you "(juestion the rights ol these
indi\iilu.ils and groups to be on campus at
all." I was even more sin prised bv your sug
gestion that the Stanford Police should be
brought in to "monitor unsavory speakers
in White Pla/a.
It's easy to feel distaste tor some of the
more rude and offensive people tli.it inter
rupt our strolls through campus. But 1 trv
to remember that, in our nation's history,
speech deemed aggressive or offensive has
done far more good than harm. I am sure
that mam white southerners in the 19">0s

found the speech of Martin I .uther King |r.
and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating
( onnniltee — mui Ii of it \oiced on private
propert\ —both aggressive and threaten
ing. \nd. without a doubt, certain members
of the Stanford communit\ felt threatened
In the aggressive words and tai tics ol those
who protested on i anipus during the Viet
nani W.n.
In hindsight, though. 1 am glad that
these aggressive speakers had thci bam e to
s.i\ their piece. 1 don't enjo\ being called a
sadist oi .i Communist am more than the
next gu\. But I think I can take it if it means
li\ing in a rommunit\ where people can ex
press theii beliefs in public without a police
officei peering over their shoulder.
When newspapers and universities
begin to condemn the act ol free speech
mereh because. the\ consiiler the speaker
to fx* "too aggressive." we are wailing into
dangerous waters as a community. 1, lot
one. would be more offended by the pres
ence of the Stanford Police "monitoring"
speet Ii in White Pla/a than In am threat or
insult hurled at me In a bearded ideologue
on a soap box.

Incident in White Plaza
highlights need for action
Not long after I read The Daily's editori
al on harassing sjx'akers and groups m
White Pla/a. 1 was harassed bv the"l*reach

cm (iu\ in While l'la/a during lunch. He
made .1 number of bigoted comments
against both "women's libbers" and
"homos." When he realized that 1 fell
under both categories, he thrust his arm
out to point at me and began veiling .it
length about m\ evilness. He continued to
veil at me. pointing at me the entire time 1
was walking awa\ to the other side of White
l'la/a.
1 didn t hear most of what he said; hon
est 1\ . 1 was t(H> shih ked for it to reallv regis
ter. \\ hen I tinned around, he had pulled
out his cell phone with his othei hand and
declared, "We should call 911, because
there's the real evil!" 1 cannot describe the
feeling I had when strangers 111 White l'la/a
tin ned to see w hat "e\ il he was pointing .it
and saw me.
In the moment, 1 laughed it off with tn\
friends, but it w.is an immensely disturbing
experience. I had been on tnv wax to a class,
and. suddenly, 1 was being singled out for
mv identit\. which, until toda\, had been a
fairly private thing.
For those who have never been the re
cipient of hate speet h. let me tn to explain
how it feels: Imagine a nauseous feeling in
response to the sense that something has
gone horribly wrong, underscored by an
adrenaline rush of panic, mixed with utter
contusion. It's not until a little later that the
rage sets in.
Two hours later, when I returned to
White I'la/a on mv wav home from ( lass, 1
