University's position on
Napster 'unchanged'
I am responding to your Feb. 21 editori
al "I niversit\ should come clean about
Napster." I lie editorial contained signiti
i ant tactual errors, as well as allegations that
arc clearh wrong and inconsistent with es
tablished I niversit\ policv. I he gist ot the
editorial is that, because ot the Ninth C'.ir
i mi ( oni tot Appeals ruling in the Napster
case, the t niversit\ caved in to the record
companies and decided to limit bandwidth
and at cess to Napster.
1 he editorial states th.it, although "I ni
versit\ otlit ials denied that the dec ision had
anvthing todo with the Napster ruling, the
timing ot the announcement suggests oth
erwise." I o the contrarv, the timing of the
announcements proves that the decision to
control bandwidth, announced on Feb. 9.
w.is not the icsult ot the Napster decision,
which was not issued bv the court until
three davs later on Feb. 12.
I he editorial's statement that the I ni
versit\ announcement tame "immediatelv
altct the court ruling making Napster ille
gal' and that the com t dei ision was issued
on l t b. 9 is simpK w long. 1 am one ot those
otlicials that explained to I he l)ail\ that the
two matters were unrelated and am disap
pointed that vou would not bother tot bet k
the most basic tacts before act using I niver
sit\ oflit ials ot being misleading.
Ihe I niversitv's position has not
changed. As I stated last fall when Stati
fbrd was threatened with the suit and

asked to ban Napster, the I niversitv's
policy is not to ban or censor access to in
tbrmation on the Internet, and that is still
our policy. It lias also been Stanford's pol
icy that it will uphold copyright laws and
take action when someone ironies to the
University with a complaint that a copy
right is being infringed.
The l)ail\ completely missed what
should be the most important aspect of
the Napster dec ision to Stanford students,
which is that the appellate court lias stat
ed that Napster users violate federal copy
right law: "Napster users who upload file
names to the search index for others to
copy violate plaintiffs " distribution
1 iglits. Napster users who clow nload files
containing copvlighted music violate
plaintiffs' "reproduction rights."
Finally, the I niversity's traffic man
agement program for the Internet does
not "restrict" Napster use or forbid use
dining high-traffic hours. It does "con
trol overall Internet bandwidth and give
traffic to entertainment sites (e.g. N.ip
ster) a lower priority." I his is necessan
to ensure that the work of the I nivei sit\
c an be done at a i easonable pace .incl not
be impeded In people using the network
for entertainment.
Indeed, Stanford's Computet and
Network Usage l'olic\ (Administrative
Cuiile Memo f>'J) states that Stanford's
network is not foi personal use unless it
is related to appropriate I nivcrsin 112 unc
tions or is pureh inc idcntal use. Massive
downloading of nuisu files ilt.it slows

down the network is not purel\ inciden
tal use.

here.
Two-hundred titt\ dollars is not a large

1 he editorial states th.it, although "I ni

our policy. It lias also been Stanford's pol

take action when someone ironies to the
University with a complaint that a copy

The l)ail\ completely missed what
should be the most important aspect of
the Napster dec ision to Stanford students,
which is that the appellate court lias stat

copy violate plaintiffs " distribution
1 iglits. Napster users who clow nload files
containing copvlighted music violate
plaintiffs' "reproduction rights."
Finally, the I niversity's traffic man

not "restrict" Napster use or forbid use
dining high-traffic hours. It does "con

Security, free speech important
I wanted to respond to your Feb. L' 7 ed
itorial. "Wbite Pla/a speakeis often t<h» ag
grcssiw." As a senio* I lia\e witnessed
more than a few aggressive speakers 111
White I'la/a. I hex have ranged tro.v en
tertaining, to obnoxious, to — as von point
ed out — intimidating.
I w holeheai ledb agree that Stanford
must ensure the salet\ ol students, stall,
fiu ult\ and others who tome to our eani
pus. I he First Amendment protects the
i iglu of spect h. not the right to phvsicalh
fori e that speei li on othei s. Anil ii would
Ik* a dangerous step loi the I niversit\ to
ignore real publii safet\ 10111 erns in favor
ola misguided application ol constitu
tional principles. Stanford should be vigi
lant in enforcing existing laws and ordi
nances that prohibit physical abuse and
intimidation.
I fowever, 1 was a bit taken aback In voui
assertion that, Ixrause Stanford is private
propert\. you "(juestion the rights ol these
indi\iilu.ils and groups to be on campus at
all." I was even more sin prised bv your sug
gestion that the Stanford Police should be
brought in to "monitor unsavory speakers
in White Pla/a.
It's easy to feel distaste tor some of the
more rude and offensive people tli.it inter
rupt our strolls through campus. But 1 trv
to remember that, in our nation's history,
speech deemed aggressive or offensive has
done far more good than harm. I am sure
that mam white southerners in the 19">0s

found the speech of Martin I .uther King |r.
and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating
( onnniltee — mui Ii of it \oiced on private
propert\ —both aggressive and threaten
ing. \nd. without a doubt, certain members
of the Stanford communit\ felt threatened
In the aggressive words and tai tics ol those
who protested on i anipus during the Viet
nani W.n.
In hindsight, though. 1 am glad that
these aggressive speakers had thci bam e to
s.i\ their piece. 1 don't enjo\ being called a
sadist oi .i Communist am more than the
next gu\. But I think I can take it if it means
li\ing in a rommunit\ where people can ex
press theii beliefs in public without a police
officei peering over their shoulder.
When newspapers and universities
begin to condemn the act ol free speech
mereh because. the\ consiiler the speaker
to fx* "too aggressive." we are wailing into
dangerous waters as a community. 1, lot
one. would be more offended by the pres
ence of the Stanford Police "monitoring"
speet Ii in White Pla/a than In am threat or
insult hurled at me In a bearded ideologue
on a soap box.
