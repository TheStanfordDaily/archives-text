level in more than four years.
I lie Conference Hoard said
vestcrday its Consumer Confi
dence Index tell to 106.8, down
from 1 1 .">.7 in January. It was the
fifth consecutive drop in the
montlih index, which has not
been this low since June 1990.
"('.onsumers are seeing .ill the
lavoff news, thev're hearing all
the d<M>in-aiid-gloom comments,
and they've gotten worried.
I here's no question about it.
said |(k'l Naroff of N.irofl Eco
nomic \dvisors in I lolland. I'a.
I he pessimism was rein
forced bv two reports released
l>\ the Commerce Department
vesterday: orders to I S. fat to
rus for big-tic ket items plunged
in |.inn.n \ to their lowest level in
19 months, while new home
sales plummeted 10.9 percent,
the biggest drop in seven vears.
For now, the economv con
tinues to walk a tightrope, avoid
ing a plunge into recession, said
I.vnn Franco, director of the
Conference Board's Consumer
Research ( enter.
" Flic erosion in consumer
confidence continues to be fu
eled b\ weakening expectations
regarding business and employ
ment conditions." Franco said.
I he (conference Board
index, based on a monthly sui
v\ of about 5.000 U.S. house
holds. is considered an impor
tant indu.itoi because consumer
spending accounts for about
two-thirds of the nation s eco
nomic activitv. The index com
pares results to its base ve.u.
1985, when it stood at 100.
Fhe overall Februan confi
dence figure was lower than the
reading of 110.5 that had been
expected bv analysts.
Still, one economist noted
that some figures in the Confer

ence Board's report are not .is
worrisome.
"Generally, it's a weak num
ber on the headline, but the de
tails show a little more encour
agement. said C.ary 1 haver,
chief economist tor A.C. Ed
wards & Sons in St. Louis.
Thaver pointed to figures
showing a growing number of
people believe the economy is
exhibiting normal conditions, as
well as figures indicating more
consumers plan to buy new
homes and cars in the next six
months.
Fhe report comes amid in
tense spec illation about whether
the Federal Reserve will cut in
tercst rates again before its next
meeting, Marc h 20. I haver and
Naroff said the\ do not believe
the drop in confidence will be
enough to push the Fed into tak
ing early action.
Fhe markets were down ves
tcrda\. with the tec h-hea\ \ Nas
daq composite index dropping
100 points to 2,207 — a new
two-year low — while the Dow
|ones industrial average was oft
five points to 10,030.
Consumers continue to be
pessimistic about the outlook
over the next six months, the
Conference Board said. Fhe
percentage of consumers ex
pecting a pickup in business con
ditions declined from 1.3.1 per
cent to I 1.1 percent, while those
anticipating conditions to wors
en increased from 15.2 percent
to 17.8 percent.
In addition, onlv 10.2 per
cent of American consumers ex
pect more jobs to become .nail
able. down from 11.7 percent
last month, 'hose expecting
fewer jobs increased from 21.5
peicent to 27.2 percent.
But 57.9 percent of con
sumers now believe the econo
mv is exhibiting normal condi
tions, up from 54.8 percent last
month.
