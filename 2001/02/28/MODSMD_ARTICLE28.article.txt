# Stop the whining, guys!

On yesterday's Page 2 of the
KSPN.com Web site, there is a
fascinating interview with for
mer Miami Heat center Rony
Seikah. where lie discusses, of all things, the
perils of being married to the cover model
<>l this year's Sports Illustrated Swimsuit
Issue.
Not world peace. Not the depletion of
bluefin tuna sto< ks in the Atlantic. Not even
basketball — a subject

that he's .it least some
what qualified to ex
pound upon.
Our man Rony —
pet haps better known for
Ins Mediterranean good
looks than anything he
li.is done on the court —
is reallv distraught over
ha\ ing to put up uith the

oflcrs of flowers from strangers and the
puppv dog-eved stares of otliet nun that
aie directed toward his wife, Klsa hemic/.
No, really, it's .1 tough thing to deal with.
All of this comes just a week after the
opening of spring training and the subse
quent opening of the floodgates for whin
ing from some of baseball s biggest stars,
(iuvs like Frank Thomas and (iary
Sheffield — whose contracts rival the (iNT
of most African nations — were carrying on
like thev were being forced to play each
game for two slices of Wonder bread and .1
packet of "strawberry chiller" kool-aid.
And, to top off the week, as the NBA
trading deadline approached, teams like
the Washington Wi/ards were forced to
deal their star plavers lor no reason other
than the fact that they were unwilling to
pla\ lor "losing teams' for the pittance of
SlO million per annum.
"Where is this all headed?" you're prob
ably asking.
Well, apart from inv desire to mention

the SI Swinisuit Issue m mv column this
week, 1 really do have a point in here
somewhere.
I he fat i of I lie matter is tli.it toda\ 's pro
fessional athletes have elevated whining,
crying, cajoling anil pontificating to .in ab
solute art form.
And it's ruining sports.
Don't get me wrong. N < »u will never meet
.1 bigger sports fan than me.
I've alwavs been the one at the I h.inks
giving (linnet table defending the gargan
tuan contracts that are doled out like IV/
candies to some mediocre-at-best athletes.
And, for the most part, I'm willing to put up
with the strange demands of what could be
called spoiled-rotten athletes.
But, some of this stuff has gone a little too
far. When sports become focused onk on
monev, endorsement deals and I V ratings,
something has gone ven wrong in tins
world.
At their (ore, sports ate about nothing
more than giving one's .ill against the com
petition— be it vottt fellow man, the ele
ments or just vourself
Phev are not about st.idituns named
after dot.coms 01 endorsement deals with
jo( k-it( h ( teams.
|list look at the difference between pro
fessional and college basketball.
It's in the plavcrs. In college, plavers are
setting screens awav from the ball, diving
for loose b.ills on the court and savoring
even minute of pla\mg time the\ (an get.
Professional offenses consist of one gu\
isolating his man at the top of the ke\ before
dri\ing tor a circus lavup or taking .111 ill ad
vised .'^-pointer.
It's in the fans. You could go to a match
up of the two last-place teams in the AC (
and find a gym packed to the rafters with
finis who are screaming with the intcnsit\ of
