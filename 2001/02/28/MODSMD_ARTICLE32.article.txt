from human genomics to scientific in

I lit- American Association tin tin- Ad
vancement in Si ience held its annual
meeting in San Francisco last week from
l*eb. 15 to Feb. 20. I he association is a
prominent national In><l\ established to
promote science and tec hnolog\ and to
communicate science to the public. 1 lie
meeting offered more than 150 sym
posia and lectures, ranging in content
from human genomics to scientific in
tegrity to advances in wine and cheese.
Stanford was well represented among
the presenters.
Among the lecturers was Donald
Kennedy, president emeritus of Stan
ford and editor in chief <>t Science mag
azine. In a talk titled "New Tests foi
Science , Kenned) reflec ted on recent
news in the area of human genomic v
I Ins week, the results of the private
ly funded effort to sequence the human
genome, led In |. Craig \ enter of Cel
era Cenoinics, were published in Sci
ence. The results of the public l\ funded
effort, led bv Francis S. Collins of the

National Institutes of Health, appeared
in Nature.
I he group behind the private effort
lias pre\ iousb been c i n u i/ecl as individ
ualist, hostile and reluctant to share the
fruits of its efforts with tlie scientific
c onununit\.
However. KennecK highlighted the
positive role of competition between the
public l\ and privateb funded efforts,
emphasi/ing the coinpleinentai \ nature
of the two sets (>f results and the ace der
ated finish-time, both \ entei and
Collins were kevnote speakers .ti ihe
meeting.
