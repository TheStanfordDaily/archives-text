### LUSAN CHUA 
A pant-l of three federal judges in ('.alifoi ma made
a decision on Feb. 1 2 that will have a profound impat I
on the lives of college students evei \ w lieie: I he\ ef
fectively shut down Napster. In more precise terms,
the 9th (lircuit ('.ourt of Appeals upheld .1 lower (< >1111
decision to issue a preliminaiA injunction against
Napster, meaning the online music powerhouse will
need to fundamentalh alter or cease its file-swapping
services.
Since the decision was announced, Internet news
pundits have scurried to analv/e its effects 011 the
music industry, Napster's busi-

ness plan and the future of peei -
to-peet networking, whit h is the
technolt>gy that enables multiple
computers on separate nctwoi ks
to share files with eat h other.

sion, how Napster w ill change its
services and how it might affect
our everyday music-listening
experiences.

these areas of copvright violation and — perhaps

sive rights of a copvright holdet — specifically. the
right to reproduce digital music and the right to dis
tribute it.
"Napster users who upload files to the search
index for others to cop\ violate plaintiffs' distribu
tion rights. Napster users who download files con
t.lining copvrighted music violate plaintiffs' repro
duction rights." the judgment stated. In othei
words, the court seems to be sa\ing that Napstei
users who swap MIMs are themselves committing
cop\ right infringement.

will lie implicated.'!'he court found that Napstei was
guiltv of contributory Infringement bo ause its se.n(li
