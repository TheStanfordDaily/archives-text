Similar to the phenomena
that a few voices singing in
unison will drown out a
room full of noise, it is be

The research involved
: l

setting up an cxpci muntal situa
tion where a monkc\ would con
centrate on a spe< if it stimulus
while othet senson distractions
went on. The researchers used
elet tropin siologn al i e< ordings

to monitot the firing patterns of
groups ol neurons and found
that the sequent < s helicxed to he
associated with the stimulus the
nionkex concentrated on were
activated s\ n< hrouousb and reg
istered highei readings than the
distia< tions.

I licse findings m.i\ lead to a
new world of understanding
about attention delu it disordei
and othei associated mental ill
nesses. Researchers believe these
disordeis max be the result of

pooi neuronal signal timing.
