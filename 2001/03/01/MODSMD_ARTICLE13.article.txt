1979
On March 1, 1079, I be Daih printed an article
about the Rotlin casts owned In the I niversity.
"Though the I niversit\ possesses a number of
Rodin statues t .isi aftei Rodin's death, the statues in
the Stanford Art Museum collection are accurateh
identified as posthumous c.isis. saitl John Schwartz,
lawver fbi the I nivei sit\.
"Schwart/. was responding to .i statement made

"Some experts believe that the t.isis or broti/e
sculptures made .mil autlioii/ed b\ the Museum
Rodin after Rotliu's tleatll are authentic.
"A differing opinion is that onh i asts authorized
and protlut ed untlei Rodin's supei \ ision during bis
lifetime can be considered authentic and original."
Bottom line: Who knew an art museum could cause so much
controversy?
