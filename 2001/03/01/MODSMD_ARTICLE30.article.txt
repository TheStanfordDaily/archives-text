### SAMEER AHMED EDITORIAL STAFF 
It's just the first da\ of Marc h. and the Madness has
alreadx begun Idr the No. I Stanford men's basketball
team.
Beginning with its critical matc hup at 7:30 pan.
tonight at Southei n ( alifbrnia. the C Ordinal will pla\
four games ovet the next two weeks, which will not
onh determine il Stanford can secure its third straight
I'.u ific 10 ('.< tnferenc e title, but also w hat seed the team
will have in the Bit; Dance. At KM in the l'ac-10, Stan
ford is currenth holds first place in the conference,
with No. 12 I CIA (12-2) and No. 8 Arizona (1 I-.'*)
(l<>seon its heels. I he C '.ardinal pla\ s at I (,1A this Sat
urda\ and hosts Arizona next I hursdav.
According to head coat h Mike Montgoinerv, it his
plavers continue to loc us on plaving basketball over
the next If davs instead of worr\ingabout the I'ac-10
title or NCA\ seeding, the team will remain strong
heading into the N( A A tournament.
"You know, the pressure should be- on others, not
us," Montgomei \ said. "We are a game ahead [in the
I'ac-10] and we just have to pla\ good basketball. And
whalevet happens at this point happens. We're going
to get a good seed in the tournament. We're going to

have a lot of wins going into the tout nainent. so we're
just tr\ ing to pla\ basketball.
Stanford (2a-1 overall) also imisi not look past
tonight s battle with I SC. (I.S-H, s ii l'ac -10). In the
two teams' last meeting on I eh. 1 at Maples I'avilion,
the I rojans almost pulled oil .hi unthinkable upset.
I SC. was ahead with six minutes rein.lining in the
game, but the ( ardinal stoi ined back on a 20-1 I i tin
at the end of the game to put the I l < >jans a\\a\. 77-71.
Since that game, IS( . onee a lock fbi the N( \\
tournament, li.is slipped into the insecure realm <>t
"bubble teams. Ihe I rojans have losi three out of
their past five games, including a 07-a2 defeat to(lie
gon State last week. But a win tonight in I ,os \ngeles
against the top team in the nation should all but dine h
a plavoff berth for I S( 1.

Stantiud is coming off two rela

After the I SC match, things
don't get any easier foi the (lardi
nal as the team heads to I'aulev
Pavilion to face I ( LA on Satur
day. Ihe Bruins 79-73 win ovei
Stanford on Feb. 3 marks the onh
blemish in the ( ardinal's record
this vear. C.oining ofl ,i 92-(>H hu
miliating defeat to California,
I CLA. led In Billy Knight's ca
reer-high 22 points, confidently
entered Maples Pavilion and took
Stanford apart. Montgomery ar
ticulated what Stanford needs to
do so history doesn't repeat itself.
"We would like" to shoot the ball
a little bit better, obviously." he said.
"We let Knight get away from us a
little bit last time, and we prefer to
do a Ixtter job on him. We need to
make big plays when we have to
make big plays. But il I ( LA play s
well, they are going to give anvboch
and everybody a game, and you're
going to have to Ik- at \our l>est to
beat them.'"
.After their victory over the Car
dinal. the Bruins season has sky
rocketed. UCLA has won seven
games straight and propelled itself
to ,i No. 12 ranking in the Al' poll.
With the Brums trailing Stanford
by onlv a game in the l'ac-10, Sat
urday's contest could decide the
l'ac-10 championship.
If the Cardinal can sweep both
Southern California schools, it will
not only clinch a tie for the l'ac-10
title, but also finish the season un
defeated on the road.
According to Montgomery , a
sweep will definitely be tough.
"They're just two really good
teams," Montgomery said. "And
you have to win one, win two,
whatever you can get. and you re
going to have to play hard .ill the
way through.
