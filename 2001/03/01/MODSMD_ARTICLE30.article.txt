tonight at Southei n ( alifbrnia. the C Ordinal will pla\
four games ovet the next two weeks, which will not
onh determine il Stanford can secure its third straight
I'.u ific 10 ('.< tnferenc e title, but also w hat seed the team
will have in the Bit; Dance. At KM in the l'ac-10, Stan
ford is currenth holds first place in the conference,
with No. 12 I CIA (12-2) and No. 8 Arizona (1 I-.'*)
(l<>seon its heels. I he C '.ardinal pla\ s at I (,1A this Sat
urda\ and hosts Arizona next I hursdav.
According to head coat h Mike Montgoinerv, it his
plavers continue to loc us on plaving basketball over
the next If davs instead of worr\ingabout the I'ac-10
title or NCA\ seeding, the team will remain strong
heading into the N( A A tournament.
"You know, the pressure should be- on others, not
us," Montgomei \ said. "We are a game ahead [in the
I'ac-10] and we just have to pla\ good basketball. And
whalevet happens at this point happens. We're going
to get a good seed in the tournament. We're going to

have a lot of wins going into the tout nainent. so we're
just tr\ ing to pla\ basketball.
Stanford (2a-1 overall) also imisi not look past
tonight s battle with I SC. (I.S-H, s ii l'ac -10). In the
two teams' last meeting on I eh. 1 at Maples I'avilion,
the I rojans almost pulled oil .hi unthinkable upset.
I SC. was ahead with six minutes rein.lining in the
game, but the ( ardinal stoi ined back on a 20-1 I i tin
at the end of the game to put the I l < >jans a\\a\. 77-71.
Since that game, IS( . onee a lock fbi the N( \\
tournament, li.is slipped into the insecure realm <>t
"bubble teams. Ihe I rojans have losi three out of
their past five games, including a 07-a2 defeat to(lie
gon State last week. But a win tonight in I ,os \ngeles
against the top team in the nation should all but dine h
a plavoff berth for I S( 1.
