from No. 7 to No. 3 in the loin
months following lus death.

that wasn't bad enough, one of

()l all the shot king things
about this story, the one that I
find most depressing is the ulti
mate tlitllit\ ol its message. No
one will be reprimanded; there's
no one to do the reprimanding.
I here's no "league «>Hic e" in h< >x
ing, no central authority; the
part\'s raging, the music's bump
ing, but ain't 110 one home up
stairs. And that means there's no
one to c lean tip, 110 resorting to a
higher power; professional box
ing is .1 war-torn desert, ruled l>\
no one but squabbling warlords
who can't even figure out who's
on thcil team and who's shuffled
off this moi tal c oil.
I lie N I I can be faulted fora
lot of things, but it has led the

leagues 111 demonstrating the
value ol ironclad central control
ol the league. When tnajoi
league baseball moved to con
centrate power 111 the- hands ol
the commissioner two yeai s ago,
it was hailed as a step forward 111
