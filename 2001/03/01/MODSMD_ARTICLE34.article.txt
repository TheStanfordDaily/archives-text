Southern California this season.
While every team expects a
humpy road through the Pa< ifi<
10 Conference season, all three
teams met with some unexpected
detours.
For Stanford, the loss of sopho
more guard Jamie (larev .1 week
before the season started brought
immediate adjustments foi the
Cardinal, whit h was picked to fin
ish first in the conference. I hen.
on Dec. 27, the unthinkable:
Freshman point guard Susan
King was forced to end her season
after an anterior crucier ligament
injury, leaving Stanford without a
single true guard or a player
under six feet.
While the Cardinal has made
the best of what it h.is — currentlv
sitting third in the conferent e. two
games behind conference-leader
Arizona State — its hard not to
think w hat might have been.
I'CLA has also had its tips and
downs. After struggling to a disap
pointing 0-8 opening record, the
Bruins looked to the return of
sophomore guard Nicole K.u/-
tnarski tnidwav through Decem
ber to lift their inexperienced
squad.
