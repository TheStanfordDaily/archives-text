I hings haven't f|one .is
planned tor Stanford, I CIA or
Southern California this season.
While every team expects a
humpy road through the Pa< ifi<
10 Conference season, all three
teams met with some unexpected
detours.
For Stanford, the loss of sopho
more guard Jamie (larev .1 week
before the season started brought
immediate adjustments foi the
Cardinal, whit h was picked to fin
ish first in the conference. I hen.
on Dec. 27, the unthinkable:
Freshman point guard Susan
King was forced to end her season
after an anterior crucier ligament
injury, leaving Stanford without a
single true guard or a player
under six feet.
While the Cardinal has made
the best of what it h.is — currentlv
sitting third in the conferent e. two
games behind conference-leader
Arizona State — its hard not to
think w hat might have been.
I'CLA has also had its tips and
downs. After struggling to a disap
pointing 0-8 opening record, the
Bruins looked to the return of
sophomore guard Nicole K.u/-
tnarski tnidwav through Decem
ber to lift their inexperienced
squad.

For the Women of I'rov. a
wealth of highlv-toutcd freshmen
recruits left I SC fans with high
hopes for the season. Howexer.
while the freshmen, most notahh
Fbom Hoffman and Aislia I lol
laiis. are performing well, the
growing pains th.it tome with hav
ing young leaders are evident.
After being pi< ketl to finish third
in the conference, the Women ot

dismal ninth plat e with two weeks
remaining.
Both the Bruins and the
