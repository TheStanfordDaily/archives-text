and some apparent. All songs on the album are wi H

In lieu ola drummer. Frust iante opts tor a drum
machine. In addition, his vocals are tweaked with
weird sMithesi/er effects and reverberations. I low
e\et. despite these detrac tors, the spirit ol the album
shines through. I he album frequently addresses
themes like death, dealing with the past and going
inside oneself.
Frusciante olten tries to rectif\ conflicting per
sonalities within himself. "Allow me to believe von

about his retreat into diugs in the 19905. In "Satu

in his life and leai ning to "drive out of focus."
Musically. Frusciante's songs are original, inter
esting and complex. However, his sub-par vocals
and questionable use of a drum mat bine take awa\
from the recording, making it seem more like .111
amateur home recording than was intended.
"lo Rei ord would have benefited from at least a
few paid studio music ians to give the album .1 more
full, encompassing sound. Frusciante's trademark
guitar stvle is of paramount importance in making
up lot the lacking vocals. Also, he com
piements his guitar with eerie and nnstical svnthe
si/er schemes. "The First Season, one of the
stronger tracks of the album, blends precision
acoustic guitar, coupled with svnthesi/er effects, to
create a morbid atmosphere with a tin\ glimmet of
hope as Frusciante moans, "Let the pretend take
over."
In "Remain." Frusciante integrates 1980s svnth
roc k and traditional folk 1 o< k that moves one's head
to bobbing in appreciation. What is even mote in
teresting is the inclusion ol an ama/ing interlude
midwa) through the song that would make even the
members ol Pink Flovd cjuivei.
There are a few iustrumentals on the album, the
best being "Ramparts.'" which contains an ama/ing
blend of electric and acoustic guitar and mandolin.
"Representing" is a reflective, morose ballad built
upon acoustic guitar and supplemented l>\ piano
and futuristic s\nth-strings. The guitai strumming
and rhythm seem to resemble "I could have lied.'
from "Blood Sugar Sex Magic
Overall, "To Record' is a wort In effort and a trib
ute to Frusciante's re-emergence into the re.dm of
the lock world. FOl some strange reason, the
album's amateur feel grows on vou. It is full of 01 ig
inalitx and deep introspection that deserxes to be le
warded. Hopefulh, next time Frusciante will hire
some studio musicians to back him up.
