An eclec tic mix of southern soul with live beats. Shea
Seger's new album — " I lie Ma\ Street Project" — is a
phenomenal compilation. I bis debut album will 1111-
doubtedh leave audieiu es spellbound In Segei 's exquis
ite voice and creative musical at c ompaniment.
I he album was initialh recorded and released 111 Lon
don, but it hammers home the feel ot an Anient a that au
diences lan and will apprec Kite. Ihe ai list. Shea Seger, is
an up-and-coming 21 -\ear-old woman from a small (own
in I exas She lias been released 111 the I nited Kingdom,
where she lias received much positive puhlu it\
I lie song, " I he I ast lime." is destined to be a ( hart
topping hit. Il is an eleganth produced sexv flirtatious
song with the magic to captivate. It incorporates an elec
tronica sound with dark undertones. Anothei notable
song is "(Hutch." which will soon be released as a single.
"(Hutch' is eclectic, memorable and grand. Il interlaces
two voices and has main well sii uc lured breaks between
sounds m the track. "( dutch" jumps out at music al con-

noissei lls .iiid has tlit* potential to steal (lie limelight oil
this album.
Nol .1 single 11.k k on this ( I) will disappoint. Segei is
good. I lie one complaint would have to he an artistic
i hoi(e to nu oi porate news radio footage that is inappro
priate to the Km sol the song "Wasting tlu- Rain. "Wast
ing the Rain is a terrific soulful romantic song that is dis
torted b\ the inclusion ol an excerpt on the exodus ol
refugees Ironi Yugoslavia. Once\ou hear the piece, it is
hard to recoiu ile oi linda just i lie at ion lor the pan ing ol
these two aspects. I he skill ol the perldrmei and mixer
.ire apparent in " I lie Ma\ Street Project. but there is still
an exciting road ahead in how Shea Seger's music
(lianges and grows.
I Ins woman has talent and an ear lor music. |anis
Joplin, At rested Development and (iintis Mavlield are
credited as some ol bet main influences. Met mixing ol
the familiar and varied is refreshing. It will be interesting
to see with which < ategon her music will become associ
ated with. It is not unimaginable that it will cross genres.
" lite Ma\ Street Project" in its entiretv is catch\ and
fun. It is rare that a ('.Dean withstand the test ol time. This
one will.
Shea Seger is delightful to hear. She has the potential

to become .1 prominent musician it'she can add more depth
to her hrics, lor she alread\ lias a ver\ solid base: A good
sound. Sever s h rics are fun, hut the\ also have the poten
tial to he soulful.
You ma\ he ahle to listen to her music on college radio
beginning March 5. II you like what you hear, the album is
planned tor retail release in June. Look for it!
