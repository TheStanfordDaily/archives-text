# A better version of Rainer Maria emerges
## From basements to the Filmore: The Intermission interview 
### KIM SAMEK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Rainer Man.i is an innovative,
poeticalh inclined emo-core
indie pop rock hand (onsistiug of
K\le Fischer (guitar, vocals),
C.aithlin De Marrais (vocals, hass)
and Bill kuehn (drums), h
formed from the ashes of the
I).iiid Fzra Pound, in which Kvle
and Kill had been working to
gether.
Five years ago, Rainer Maria
started out with no serious inten
tions of being a big rock band.
I'lie band pla\ed basements and
toured small shows during s< liool
breaks and summers for fun.
However, its talent was recog
nized as they began opening for
larger bands coming through
Madison. Alter watching friends
grow up and lind jobs elsewhere
after school, the band decided to
leave Wisconsin and head for
New York, home of I'olwinvl, the
band's record label, where the)
continued to grow.
Rainer Maria released its third
fall-length CD, titled A Bettei
Version of Me," |an. 23, and the
record death demonstrates the
band's lyric aland music al
growth.
The band is currently on a na
tion-wide tour supporting the
album. Saturclav night at the 112 ill
more, Rainer Maria played a sold
out show opening for fellow New
York City band Luna. I he show
kicked off with the album's pow
erpop gem, "Artiflci.il Light,"

which is also'the opening song on
the record. Despite the over
whelmingly present faction of
older, San Francisco hipsters
clothed in various shades of
Mack. R.unci Maria managed to
win over the crowd. The band's
energy proved successful, as gui
tarist Kyle Fischer hopped
around on-stage, flying off the

drum kit at one point.
before the show, 1
sat clowi) with the hand
and disc ussed it*> past,
its inspirations and the
new album.
When did you start
creating music and
writing poetry?
K\lr: 112 guess I slatt
ed sei iouslv in HMW. I
pla\ed drums in a roc k
and toll band and then
pi( ked up guitar.
(Milhlin: Yeah, but
you were in niarc lung
band.

K\le: 1 was pla\ing marching
pei c ussion concert as a child and
in high school. I always wrote
something. 1 remember in fifth
grade, 1 would tr\ to write the
grossest stories foi * lass and the
other kids would go "yuck.
Did you grow up wanting to be
writers, or musicians, or both?
Caithlin: 1 wanted to be a
writer, deliniteh.
Do you ever think about going
into writing seriously?
C.aithhn: 1 think all of out fu
tures are prett\ open. If we tout
fora few more years, or forever,
however long. We're all creative
in different ways and have other
side interests.
Kyle: I always thought that I
was going to he a writer, and m\
sister was supposed to be the mu
sician. She was a concert pianist.

and then,
now, she is
the one
that is
going to
K r a (I
S( hool. and
I'm in a
rock and
roll hand.
Wh en
did you de
cide that
you wanted
to go into
music?
Cmthliu:
11ist to have
fnn in col
lege. Bill
and Kvle

had a hand already, and they
said, "I ley, come pla\ bass."
When did you pick up bass?
('.ailhlin: Just then.
Have you always sung?
Caithlin: I had done a little
singing. Flementary s< hool ( ho
rns. I had to develop some sort of

singing voice.
You just sung every day and it
got stronger?
C.aithhn: Yeah, exactly, and
also tlu' result o! realh had PAs. 1
had (o realh stream to he heard
in basement shows.
liill: 1 think that goes lor |>la\
ing out instruments as well. k\le
and I. I think since '93, we were
placing inside of basements
which would have small I'As at
best. We'd pla\ realh loud, and I
think it really influenced (lie stvle
of our music.
Were you in college together?
Madison, Wisconsin veah.
How did you feel about the
scene in Madison? And you
moved to New York, right?
Hill: It was a college town, so it
was tlillerent even foui wars.
We had all been out of s< hool for
a while, so we had seen it turn
over actually twice before we de
(itletl to leave. We would see all of
out friends move onto bigger and
better things, get real jobs, a lot of
tjieni in New York, actuallv. So
after watt hing that, we decided to
move on.
Why New York and not I.A or
Seattle or somewhere else?
Caithhn: I have family in (lon
net tit lit. San Francisco's prett\
tool, but I'm afraid ol eat 111<|ii.ikt*s.
Kyle, 1 heard you studied in
Berlin for awhile.
Kyle: Yeah, I lived in Berlin for
a summer, and I had lived prcvi
oush m (iermanv fora year.
What was the music scene like
there?
Kyle: Oh. it's ama/ing, hut I
wasn't reallv hanging out in the
rock and roll scene. I saw the
Blonde Redhead over there, and
it was totally fabulous. Alet Fm
pire was spinning a lot. if you're
into the digital end of things. I
wasn't doing the rock and roll
thing as much as I was doing the

film thing. I worked
fora (ierman film di
i ec tot in Berlin.
Are you in
spired by Rainer
Maria Rilke? Why did
you choose it as a
band name?
C.aithlin: We
thought it was a pi ft t \
name at the time. I hat
question we've been
asked quite a bit. and

people tome up to us
and sa\.'()h, he\. I just
disc overed that there's
this poet,' and thex're excitetl
about it
Kyle: 1 here's the extent to
whit h von t boose \oui name ant I
to which \oiii name chooses von,
I don't want to be all mvstical
about it. but having selected that
name and bet oiiuiii; vei \ rapitlh
a dual \ ot al band. . .
('.aithlin: Rainer Maria, is it a
guv's name or a woman's name,
\ou know?
Do you pronounce your hand
like the poet (phonetically
Ryner)?
C.mlhlin: \ tali, we pronounce
it (iernian-stvle.
Are all of you influenced by
Germany?
Kyle: I'm the (»ermano-phile.
What bands are you influ
enced by?
Caithlin: Foday, I was just
thinking about how everyone in
in\ familv, because there are
seven people, have influent ed ins
musical love. M\ si*»tet was realh
into I he Who, and she's 12 \eats
older than I am. I have another,
sister into show tunes.
What about bands who are
around right now?
C.nilhliti: Blonde Redhead, def
initely.
Hill: We like the Mouse. Mod
est Mouse.
I love Modest Mouse.
Kyle: Red House Painters.
What is your song-writing
process like?
Kyle: We'll take them however
the\ come, but usu.ilh we have a
basis of an idea, a series of chord
changes on the guitar. We try to
attack th.it at practice in a collab
orative manner while the idea is
fresh and the energy is there.
Without a set idea of how it will
turn out, we ping pong it around
between the three of lis and then
tack the lyrics on .it the end.
Your new album, "A Better

Version of Me," came out about a
month ago. What does the title
refer to?
('.aithlin: I lie last lvric of the
last song ol the album. I don't
want to put words into what Kvle
and Hill think about it. But, lot
me . . . it's about a new person
emerging. Someone wrote about
it.and I thought the\ hit the ti.til
on the head (pauses). No, I said it.
actually! (laughs) Kspecialh the
first album, there .ire issues of
past pain or (urrent tension,
whereas this album is about heing
past that. You don't have the feel
tli.it pain, and you can leave it be
hind. \ bettei version of yourself
mavbe will come out. I lie last
song lot me tells the most stuff off
the album.
Being an underground band,
what's your take on Napster?
I las it helped or hurt your album
sales?
K\le: I think, at our level, am
exposure is good exposure. I lie
ke\ is getting the word out. ( er
tainly. since we were kids, the
technology to bootleg was
around.
('.aithlin. Well, since Napstei
has come out. and since out
album has come out. we've sold
w.iv more than any of the other
albums. I don't think it's alfected
it at all.
112 low has your tour been? With
Luna?
Kyle: 1 his is om se( ond and
last night with I.una. It's a real-
Is different crowd. We toured
with Siipcrchmik before, and.
when we played with tlieni, I
was like 'who are these people!
I his t rowd is so different!'
When we play with Super
( hunk, their fans are like grow n
up versions of our fans, whereas
these people, I have no idea
where thev come from, what
the\ do when the\ go home. Do
thev eat? Do they excrete? I
don't know!
Luna is from New York too,
right? Do you know them from
back there?
('.aithlin: Nope, different cir< les.
Kyle: M\ mom totally went to
high school with Dean. In
Kansas, totally cra/y. We saw hei
yearbook when we were at her
house.
Bill: He was so nerdv. He's
nerdy now in a cute way, but back
then . . .
('.aithlin: He was iu the men's
glee club or something!
