### CHARLES SCHOONOVER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
1 ast Mav. .t It irihl ol nunc, well aw.ire of mv interest in hip-hop
scholarship, informed idc ol .i hook release p.it I v at the Bookstore.
Ihe hook w .is < alle<l "Streel ('.onscions Rap, and it w .is the third
volume in a series that utilized articles and interviews to explore
the lessei known, iiioi <• m>< iall\ conscious side ot the movement.
I pon attending the engagement. I discovered that one <>l the
hook s autliois was II Sani\ Mini, a Stanford doctoral student in
the School ol education I iccenth had the privilege ol meeting
with .Mini to discuss hi > invaluable hook, hip-hop scholarship in
genet a I and the possihilit \ <> 112 a i l.is v that would I>i ing such s'chol
arship to Stanford undei graduates
Let's start very basically. What is it that got you into rap and
hip-hop in the first place?
I guess rap and hip-hop lot me came unconst louslv. 'C.ause I
i.in ieineinhei being into hip-hop befoie I knew what the thing
c ailed hip-hop was It w .is uevei i eall\ talked about. but we'd be .it
the rollei links, just, \ou know, it w.is I'lanet Rex k. | Mnca| Bani
bat.i, (• rand mast ei I lash. MelU Mel. .ill th.it old st ull before I even
knew what it w.is, 'cause I w.is like si\.
And then it was break clam iug So we got into it like that, just
messing around with bteak dancing, messing around with .i little
i appiug 1111 - .in«l iii \ brothel sll grew into ast holat l\ enter ptise
when I entered undergrad at I in\eisii\ ol l'enns\lvania.
That's what I was wondering, 'cause being a fan of hip hop
seems fairly common nowadays, but to approach it academically
seems like a whole different story. To go from the person listen
ing to Grandmaster Flash to interview ing him fora book . . .
Yeah! It's a cra/\ experience. I was |ust looking through the
book before von came. Its kind ol niincl hngglin', 'cause I don't
have a( ha nee to sit down and relict ton it, < a use lile moves on to
the next project, the next thing, so vou don't gel a c hance to think
about it.
But, 111 tell you spet ilit alls how m\ interest in hip-hop scholar
ship realh came about. I here was a class at the I niversit\ t>l I'enn
s\ Ivania — it's a pioneet nig t lass — n w as taught in I I believe,
"'.>() / '1)7, b\ |atnes IVterstm, a graduate student in Fnglish. It was
a writing c lass t ailed "Witting in, of and about Hip Hop ( ail t lire."
I think the subtitle was "keeping it real."
And it was the academic approach to hip-hop Chat's what we

did in that
( lass, we ana
lyzed it and
everything.
I hat t lass led
to my work
ing on this
hook. and
this is how
||am e s |
Spadv, who
was in
Philadelphia,
.tnd I — 1 w as
at [the] I ni
ve r si t \ t > I
I'ennsN Ivania
were invit
etl to speak
to out t lass,
because we
w ere i catling
the set ond
book in the
\ olutne.

So Spady obviously had some establishment
before (you worked with him].
Riijlit It's .1 privilege and an honor to be in
volved in something as large .is this. I his is what
now lias become, I guess, a 15-, 20-veai study <»l
hip-hop culture. From the e.irh days til now.
It's an ongoing thing.
And to be working with somehod\ like Spady
is iin i edible, cause he's like a pioneer in this.
He had a book called "lndigine," and what lie
did in that book was sort ol predict a ni.iss
hased. street-based, cultural form. What we saw
happening in i.ip music on a major level in the
eat lv '80s, all the was through til now. And then
he began with "Nation Conscious Rap in HMM"
it was several questions that he was asking
and documenting about hip-hop c ulture that no
one else was realh asking.
'('..uise w hat he sought to do, and what we try
to do, in all three ol these volumes and in our re
search on hip-hop culture, is speak directlv with
the i ulture creators. You know, sidestep all the
bull, sidestep all the guessing and pontificating,
theorizing: We go straight to the heart.
How does that bring about challenges of ac
tually putting the book together?
It's a huge challenge. Anvone who's ever
transcribed spoken speet h, spoken word, knows
that it's .i huge < hallenge because we don't speak
as we write. So to put the spoken voices in print,
espec ialh the dynamic voicestliat we have here
in hip-hop — hip-hop nation language and the
narrative structure and techniques used are so
dvnamic — that to represent the spoken word,
tlu- hip-hop spoken word, on the written page is
a really clillic 1111 task.
And it's time consuming, and it requires .1 lot
ol«lose attention to the speech and the turn-tak
ing and the conversations, cause sometimes
words overlap, so von have to be ver\ attentive
to that and representing it accurately, linguisti
cally and Culturally. So it is hip-hop that people
are reading, and nothing else.
Cool. Are there two or three interviews that

stand out in your mind?
That's a good question, but it's a
hard question. Like I said, reflect
ing back on this book, it's just
loaded with memories for me, so
many memories. But there are sev
eral interviews that I want to point
to quicklv that I've been thinking a
lot about the historical significance
of lately. And there are three inter
views, I think, just flipping through
this, where people are no longer
with us. And that's Big Pun, lie's no
longer with us: Tupac Shakur, he's
no longer wit h us and |at k the Rap
per is no longer with us.
So. those interviews are immedi
ate and urgent on m\ mind right
now because they have preserved
not onlv the voice and the values
and the opinions, but the histor\ of
what's going on here. So main peo
ple were unfamiliar with Big Pun's
social consciousness. Chat he actu
all \ wanted to start a Bovs and (.ills

Club, tli.it he had plans and tli.it lit*
had a family atul was grow ing and even t liing.
This is now documented for people to see.
How much do you think this [social con
sciousness! is overlooked by the average fan?
It's hugeh overlooked, and it doesn't have
to be that way, 'cause these things are hap
pening tight in front ol our face. II we would
only sta\ connected to what's going on. we
would be able to see it. It's happening 111 front
of our face, daily. And part ol documenting
these stories in this book is we care about this
stuff, so we ask about it.
We're not just asking about what went
down at the after party. We're not asking
strictly, you know, "If you go to buv weed,
where do you go to buy weed?" We don't
deal with that. We deal with real slut, reall\
So, when you talk to L.L Cool |~ lie's not
|iist a shining face on TV, lie's someone
who's got Camp Cool |. Who's taking like a
hundred kids, teaching them about AIDS,
teaching them about computers. You t.ilk to
big Pun, and vou see what he's doing. You
talk to Common, you see what he's doing for
the community, starting his educational
programs.
You see hip-hop's social consciousness in a
way that is so ill-represented. In fact, it's not
represented at all. 1 won't even sav ill-repre
sented. And it's missing, and it leads to the
miscom eption of hip-hop. And people get lost
in the image and the glit/ and what is brought
to them. Let's put it like that.
To generally wrap up, then, is there any
thing else you want to say about the book?
Let's see. II I could just s.iv something
about the interviews. I think that one of the
things that makes "Street ('.oust ions R.tp and
the hip-hop trilogy so fascinating is that the
interviews are in depth. And they're beyond
what we see and what he hear. A lot of the
time, hip-hop artists are not asked serious
questions. They're not probed for answers.
They give an answer and the interviewer

moves on.
And the\ don't probe and thev don't seek
to find out what .ire the aesthetics that are
shaping these artists? \\!i.»t are the value s\ s
tetns that allow this artist to create the art that
the) create, to push the meanings that the\
push? What is the work ethn involved in pro
ducing an album, a movie, going on tour
abroad and coming back, within the same
three-month period? What does it take to be
grounded like that, morally, spirituallv?
What is the spiritual side ol hip-hop? How
did these artists grow up? How did they ex
perience school? How did they see them
selves in connection to school? Was there a
connection?
You know, what is their lamih life like? Did
thev have a relationship with their mother
and lather? Did the) have friends coming up.
older people showing them the ropes? Do
thev have sons, daughters? How has that
changed them?
All ol these things that we are asking are
dealing with people fundamental!). They
happen to be hip-hop artists I feel so
strong!) about this bet ause nnu h ol w hat we
do and what I tr\ to do is to humanize hip
hop. Kspeciall\ the young, black people who
are creating this. It's humanizing them. So
the humanizing element ofwhat we're trying
to do is consistent with how we see ourselves
in this world and where we need to go. And
that's what we're doing with this hip-hop
tiling. That's why it's bigger than hip-hop.
right? Dead Prez: It's bigger than hip-hop.
It's much bigger than hip-hop. We're deal
ing with people, lives, lived experiences, re
alities, histories and futures. That's it
(laughs).

talk to Common, you see what he's doing for
the community, starting his educational

You see hip-hop's social consciousness in a
way that is so ill-represented. In fact, it's not
represented at all. 1 won't even sav ill-repre

miscom eption of hip-hop. And people get lost
in the image and the glit/ and what is brought
to them. Let's put it like that.
To generally wrap up, then, is there any
thing else you want to say about the book?
Let's see. II I could just s.iv something
about the interviews. I think that one of the
things that makes "Street ('.oust ions R.tp and
the hip-hop trilogy so fascinating is that the
interviews are in depth. And they're beyond
what we see and what he hear. A lot of the
time, hip-hop artists are not asked serious

They give an answer and the interviewer

1 ast Mav. .t It irihl ol nunc, well aw.ire of mv interest in hip-hop
scholarship, informed idc ol .i hook release p.it I v at the Bookstore.
Ihe hook w .is < alle<l "Streel ('.onscions Rap, and it w .is the third
volume in a series that utilized articles and interviews to explore
the lessei known, iiioi <• m>< iall\ conscious side ot the movement.
I pon attending the engagement. I discovered that one <>l the
hook s autliois was II Sani\ Mini, a Stanford doctoral student in
the School ol education I iccenth had the privilege ol meeting
with .Mini to discuss hi > invaluable hook, hip-hop scholarship in
genet a I and the possihilit \ <> 112 a i l.is v that would I>i ing such s'chol
arship to Stanford undei graduates
Let's start very basically. What is it that got you into rap and
hip-hop in the first place?
I guess rap and hip-hop lot me came unconst louslv. 'C.ause I
i.in ieineinhei being into hip-hop befoie I knew what the thing
c ailed hip-hop was It w .is uevei i eall\ talked about. but we'd be .it
the rollei links, just, \ou know, it w.is I'lanet Rex k. | Mnca| Bani
bat.i, (• rand mast ei I lash. MelU Mel. .ill th.it old st ull before I even
knew what it w.is, 'cause I w.is like si\.
And then it was break clam iug So we got into it like that, just
messing around with bteak dancing, messing around with .i little
i appiug 1111 - .in«l iii \ brothel sll grew into ast holat l\ enter ptise
when I entered undergrad at I in\eisii\ ol l'enns\lvania.
That's what I was wondering, 'cause being a fan of hip hop
seems fairly common nowadays, but to approach it academically
seems like a whole different story. To go from the person listen
ing to Grandmaster Flash to interview ing him fora book . . .
Yeah! It's a cra/\ experience. I was |ust looking through the
book before von came. Its kind ol niincl hngglin', 'cause I don't
have a( ha nee to sit down and relict ton it, < a use lile moves on to
the next project, the next thing, so vou don't gel a c hance to think
about it.
But, 111 tell you spet ilit alls how m\ interest in hip-hop scholar
ship realh came about. I here was a class at the I niversit\ t>l I'enn
s\ Ivania — it's a pioneet nig t lass — n w as taught in I I believe,
"'.>() / '1)7, b\ |atnes IVterstm, a graduate student in Fnglish. It was
a writing c lass t ailed "Witting in, of and about Hip Hop ( ail t lire."
I think the subtitle was "keeping it real."
And it was the academic approach to hip-hop Chat's what we

did in that
( lass, we ana
lyzed it and
everything.
I hat t lass led
to my work
ing on this
hook. and
this is how
||am e s |
Spadv, who
was in
Philadelphia,
.tnd I — 1 w as
at [the] I ni
ve r si t \ t > I
I'ennsN Ivania
were invit
etl to speak
to out t lass,
because we
w ere i catling
the set ond
book in the
\ olutne.

So Spady obviously had some establishment
before (you worked with him].
Riijlit It's .1 privilege and an honor to be in
volved in something as large .is this. I his is what
now lias become, I guess, a 15-, 20-veai study <»l
hip-hop culture. From the e.irh days til now.
It's an ongoing thing.
And to be working with somehod\ like Spady
is iin i edible, cause he's like a pioneer in this.
He had a book called "lndigine," and what lie
did in that book was sort ol predict a ni.iss
hased. street-based, cultural form. What we saw
happening in i.ip music on a major level in the
eat lv '80s, all the was through til now. And then
he began with "Nation Conscious Rap in HMM"
it was several questions that he was asking
and documenting about hip-hop c ulture that no
one else was realh asking.
'('..uise w hat he sought to do, and what we try
to do, in all three ol these volumes and in our re
search on hip-hop culture, is speak directlv with
the i ulture creators. You know, sidestep all the
bull, sidestep all the guessing and pontificating,
theorizing: We go straight to the heart.
How does that bring about challenges of ac
tually putting the book together?
It's a huge challenge. Anvone who's ever
transcribed spoken speet h, spoken word, knows
that it's .i huge < hallenge because we don't speak
as we write. So to put the spoken voices in print,
espec ialh the dynamic voicestliat we have here
in hip-hop — hip-hop nation language and the
narrative structure and techniques used are so
dvnamic — that to represent the spoken word,
tlu- hip-hop spoken word, on the written page is
a really clillic 1111 task.
And it's time consuming, and it requires .1 lot
ol«lose attention to the speech and the turn-tak
ing and the conversations, cause sometimes
words overlap, so von have to be ver\ attentive
to that and representing it accurately, linguisti
cally and Culturally. So it is hip-hop that people
are reading, and nothing else.
Cool. Are there two or three interviews that

stand out in your mind?
That's a good question, but it's a
hard question. Like I said, reflect
ing back on this book, it's just
loaded with memories for me, so
many memories. But there are sev
eral interviews that I want to point
to quicklv that I've been thinking a
lot about the historical significance
of lately. And there are three inter
views, I think, just flipping through
this, where people are no longer
with us. And that's Big Pun, lie's no
longer with us: Tupac Shakur, he's
no longer wit h us and |at k the Rap
per is no longer with us.
So. those interviews are immedi
ate and urgent on m\ mind right
now because they have preserved
not onlv the voice and the values
and the opinions, but the histor\ of
what's going on here. So main peo
ple were unfamiliar with Big Pun's
social consciousness. Chat he actu
all \ wanted to start a Bovs and (.ills

Club, tli.it he had plans and tli.it lit*
had a family atul was grow ing and even t liing.
This is now documented for people to see.
How much do you think this [social con
sciousness! is overlooked by the average fan?
It's hugeh overlooked, and it doesn't have
to be that way, 'cause these things are hap
pening tight in front ol our face. II we would
only sta\ connected to what's going on. we
would be able to see it. It's happening 111 front
of our face, daily. And part ol documenting
these stories in this book is we care about this
stuff, so we ask about it.
We're not just asking about what went
down at the after party. We're not asking
strictly, you know, "If you go to buv weed,
where do you go to buy weed?" We don't
deal with that. We deal with real slut, reall\
So, when you talk to L.L Cool |~ lie's not
|iist a shining face on TV, lie's someone
who's got Camp Cool |. Who's taking like a
hundred kids, teaching them about AIDS,
teaching them about computers. You t.ilk to
big Pun, and vou see what he's doing. You
talk to Common, you see what he's doing for
the community, starting his educational
programs.
You see hip-hop's social consciousness in a
way that is so ill-represented. In fact, it's not
represented at all. 1 won't even sav ill-repre

It's a huge challenge. Anvone who's ever
transcribed spoken speet h, spoken word, knows
that it's .i huge < hallenge because we don't speak
as we write. So to put the spoken voices in print,
espec ialh the dynamic voicestliat we have here
in hip-hop — hip-hop nation language and the
narrative structure and techniques used are so
dvnamic — that to represent the spoken word,
tlu- hip-hop spoken word, on the written page is
a really clillic 1111 task.
And it's time consuming, and it requires .1 lot
ol«lose attention to the speech and the turn-tak
ing and the conversations, cause sometimes
words overlap, so von have to be ver\ attentive
to that and representing it accurately, linguisti
cally and Culturally. So it is hip-hop that people
are reading, and nothing else.
Cool. Are there two or three interviews that

stand out in your mind?
That's a good question, but it's a
hard question. Like I said, reflect
ing back on this book, it's just
loaded with memories for me, so
many memories. But there are sev
eral interviews that I want to point
to quicklv that I've been thinking a
lot about the historical significance
of lately. And there are three inter
views, I think, just flipping through
this, where people are no longer
with us. And that's Big Pun, lie's no
longer with us: Tupac Shakur, he's
no longer wit h us and |at k the Rap
per is no longer with us.
So. those interviews are immedi
ate and urgent on m\ mind right
now because they have preserved
not onlv the voice and the values
and the opinions, but the histor\ of
what's going on here. So main peo
ple were unfamiliar with Big Pun's
social consciousness. Chat he actu
all \ wanted to start a Bovs and (.ills

Club, tli.it he had plans and tli.it lit*
had a family atul was grow ing and even t liing.
This is now documented for people to see.
How much do you think this [social con
sciousness! is overlooked by the average fan?
It's hugeh overlooked, and it doesn't have
to be that way, 'cause these things are hap
pening tight in front ol our face. II we would
only sta\ connected to what's going on. we
would be able to see it. It's happening 111 front
of our face, daily. And part ol documenting
these stories in this book is we care about this
stuff, so we ask about it.
We're not just asking about what went
down at the after party. We're not asking
strictly, you know, "If you go to buv weed,
where do you go to buy weed?" We don't
deal with that. We deal with real slut, reall\
So, when you talk to L.L Cool |~ lie's not
|iist a shining face on TV, lie's someone
who's got Camp Cool |. Who's taking like a
hundred kids, teaching them about AIDS,
teaching them about computers. You t.ilk to
big Pun, and vou see what he's doing. You
talk to Common, you see what he's doing for
the community, starting his educational
programs.
You see hip-hop's social consciousness in a
way that is so ill-represented. In fact, it's not
represented at all. 1 won't even sav ill-repre
sented. And it's missing, and it leads to the
miscom eption of hip-hop. And people get lost
in the image and the glit/ and what is brought
to them. Let's put it like that.
To generally wrap up, then, is there any
thing else you want to say about the book?
Let's see. II I could just s.iv something
about the interviews. I think that one of the
things that makes "Street ('.oust ions R.tp and
the hip-hop trilogy so fascinating is that the
interviews are in depth. And they're beyond
what we see and what he hear. A lot of the
time, hip-hop artists are not asked serious
questions. They're not probed for answers.
They give an answer and the interviewer

moves on.
And the\ don't probe and thev don't seek
to find out what .ire the aesthetics that are
shaping these artists? \\!i.»t are the value s\ s
tetns that allow this artist to create the art that
the) create, to push the meanings that the\
push? What is the work ethn involved in pro
ducing an album, a movie, going on tour
abroad and coming back, within the same
three-month period? What does it take to be

What is the spiritual side ol hip-hop? How
did these artists grow up? How did they ex

selves in connection to school? Was there a

You know, what is their lamih life like? Did
thev have a relationship with their mother
and lather? Did the) have friends coming up.

thev have sons, daughters? How has that

All ol these things that we are asking are

happen to be hip-hop artists I feel so
strong!) about this bet ause nnu h ol w hat we
do and what I tr\ to do is to humanize hip
hop. Kspeciall\ the young, black people who
are creating this. It's humanizing them. So
the humanizing element ofwhat we're trying
to do is consistent with how we see ourselves
in this world and where we need to go. And
that's what we're doing with this hip-hop
tiling. That's why it's bigger than hip-hop.
right? Dead Prez: It's bigger than hip-hop.
It's much bigger than hip-hop. We're deal

1 ast Mav. .t It irihl ol nunc, well aw.ire of mv interest in hip-hop
scholarship, informed idc ol .i hook release p.it I v at the Bookstore.
Ihe hook w .is < alle<l "Streel ('.onscions Rap, and it w .is the third
volume in a series that utilized articles and interviews to explore
the lessei known, iiioi <• m>< iall\ conscious side ot the movement.
I pon attending the engagement. I discovered that one <>l the
hook s autliois was II Sani\ Mini, a Stanford doctoral student in
the School ol education I iccenth had the privilege ol meeting
with .Mini to discuss hi > invaluable hook, hip-hop scholarship in
genet a I and the possihilit \ <> 112 a i l.is v that would I>i ing such s'chol
arship to Stanford undei graduates
Let's start very basically. What is it that got you into rap and
hip-hop in the first place?
I guess rap and hip-hop lot me came unconst louslv. 'C.ause I
i.in ieineinhei being into hip-hop befoie I knew what the thing
c ailed hip-hop was It w .is uevei i eall\ talked about. but we'd be .it
the rollei links, just, \ou know, it w.is I'lanet Rex k. | Mnca| Bani
bat.i, (• rand mast ei I lash. MelU Mel. .ill th.it old st ull before I even
knew what it w.is, 'cause I w.is like si\.
And then it was break clam iug So we got into it like that, just
messing around with bteak dancing, messing around with .i little
i appiug 1111 - .in«l iii \ brothel sll grew into ast holat l\ enter ptise
when I entered undergrad at I in\eisii\ ol l'enns\lvania.
That's what I was wondering, 'cause being a fan of hip hop
seems fairly common nowadays, but to approach it academically
seems like a whole different story. To go from the person listen
ing to Grandmaster Flash to interview ing him fora book . . .
Yeah! It's a cra/\ experience. I was |ust looking through the
book before von came. Its kind ol niincl hngglin', 'cause I don't
have a( ha nee to sit down and relict ton it, < a use lile moves on to
the next project, the next thing, so vou don't gel a c hance to think
about it.
But, 111 tell you spet ilit alls how m\ interest in hip-hop scholar
ship realh came about. I here was a class at the I niversit\ t>l I'enn
s\ Ivania — it's a pioneet nig t lass — n w as taught in I I believe,
"'.>() / '1)7, b\ |atnes IVterstm, a graduate student in Fnglish. It was
a writing c lass t ailed "Witting in, of and about Hip Hop ( ail t lire."
I think the subtitle was "keeping it real."
And it was the academic approach to hip-hop Chat's what we

did in that
( lass, we ana
lyzed it and
everything.
I hat t lass led
to my work
ing on this
hook. and
this is how
||am e s |
Spadv, who
was in
Philadelphia,
.tnd I — 1 w as
at [the] I ni
ve r si t \ t > I
I'ennsN Ivania
were invit
etl to speak
to out t lass,
because we
w ere i catling
the set ond
book in the
\ olutne.

So Spady obviously had some establishment
before (you worked with him].
Riijlit It's .1 privilege and an honor to be in
volved in something as large .is this. I his is what
now lias become, I guess, a 15-, 20-veai study <»l
hip-hop culture. From the e.irh days til now.
It's an ongoing thing.
And to be working with somehod\ like Spady
is iin i edible, cause he's like a pioneer in this.
He had a book called "lndigine," and what lie
did in that book was sort ol predict a ni.iss
hased. street-based, cultural form. What we saw
happening in i.ip music on a major level in the
eat lv '80s, all the was through til now. And then
he began with "Nation Conscious Rap in HMM"
it was several questions that he was asking
and documenting about hip-hop c ulture that no
one else was realh asking.
'('..uise w hat he sought to do, and what we try
to do, in all three ol these volumes and in our re
search on hip-hop culture, is speak directlv with
the i ulture creators. You know, sidestep all the
bull, sidestep all the guessing and pontificating,
theorizing: We go straight to the heart.
How does that bring about challenges of ac
tually putting the book together?
It's a huge challenge. Anvone who's ever
transcribed spoken speet h, spoken word, knows
that it's .i huge < hallenge because we don't speak
as we write. So to put the spoken voices in print,
