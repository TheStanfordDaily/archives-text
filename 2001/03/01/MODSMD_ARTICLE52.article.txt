"I think the Feast of the Twelve jewelz with Rza and
Raekwon of the Wu-Tang Clan was a very pivotal experi
ence for nie, and it's one that is etched in my mind. North
Phi11y,1999, the daw n of the new millennium, you know,
very timely. This was a feast with both physical food and
spiritual food, because we all exist on multiple planes of
consciousness, as the R/a would remind us.
"This feast represented to me the true power of hip
hop, and that is to effect change in the very communities
that need it the most (the very communities in which hip
hop was born). Wu-Tang and many hip-hop heads see
that we cannot be satisfied with the current conditions.
Therefore, dissatisfaction must bring about change.
" Co see w hat the Wu has done for its people — includ
ing setting up computer labs iu the very school that tliev
attended and setting up scholarship funds for those stu
dents — represented something fundamental to me.
Family, love, knowledge, wisdom, change. To bring about
Freedom, Justice and Fquality. This is what hip-hop is
about. I bis is what we are about. I he trilogy is about the
business ot humanizing those who have been dehuman
ized historically.
"These books are about getting to the core of this very
dynamic, complex and highly misunderstood culture,
and, thus, getting to the core of these hiphopologic.il be
ings, human/ hue-man beings. Hip-hop cultural studies
is indeed a very humanistic enterprise. It tells us a lot
about who we are. what we stand for, what we believe and
forces us — nil of us — to explore what is in our hearts and
our souls. That's some deep shit right there. One love.
Peace to the entire hip-hop universe and those who un
derstand. P.E.A.C ;.f."
