and Whileliurst said, "We
founded bent Spoon this vear to
piovide greater opportunities
loi the Stanford modern dancers
on campus." .
However, then success belies
the ohst.K les tliex faced along the
wax. Despite financial assistance
and support from K&S and the
\ssl , the production process
met with bureaiurati( resistance
and equipment limitations. De
spite these setba< ks. Kent Spoon
has arrived.

And about the name? flic
group's title is actuallx the
product ol hours of random
suggestions, but don't be
looled b\ the D.id.i like nomen

the title is testament to the

attention to detail into some
thing that speaks to modcrnitx
