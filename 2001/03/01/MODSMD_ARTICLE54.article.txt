traditional Insli hand, brought
jigs, reels, hall.ids. loll» songs and
thru own brand ol traditional
111siissi it to Dinkelspiel's stage
on the night ol Feb. 21.
Alt au's repertoire consists ola
combination ol unusual northern
Ii ish flute tunes and old Donegal
fiddle music. The band was
formed in Donegal in the mid
'80s In lead singei and fiddler
Mairead Ni Mhaonaigh and her
husband, flutist Frankie
kennedx . I hex added a group ol
music ians to the growing ensem
ble. who were all old friends ol the
couple.
Over the years, the group
added and exchanged members

and suffered the loss of Ken tied v.
the h.uul lcadei and man.igci. to
cancer. Fventualh it arrived at
the c urrent arrangement, which
includes Daithi Sproule on gin

In 1996, \lt.ni
signed a contt ac t
with Virgin
Records, becoming
the litst band ol its
kind to be signed hx
a major label.
Despite the oxer
lap of instruments.
Allan's sound is lull
but not overwhelm
ing. Perhaps its
greatest asset is
Mhaonaigh's voice
pure, wistful and
achingly c lear, con-

vexing the tone of a song even
when its meaning is lost m the
(.aelic l\ tic s.
but it seems that even mem
bei ol the band brings a unique
talent. Mhaonaigh, in addition to

.1 delight to hear,
too; liis solo, in
which lie sang
and played gui

the high points
of the show.
Possibl\
the most sur
prising talent is
Brvne on but
ton accordion:
Although accor
dion is usnalU a
hat kground in
strinnent, often
somewhat comi
cal in sound,
llryne's is also
used as a
melody instru
ment. His light
ning-fast solo

passages were breathtaking,
whereas, in other songs. Ins ac
cordion contributed a welcome
wind-instrument tone to the oth
erwise string-dominated band.
In addition to the baud's im
passioned plaving, Alt.in brought
a touch oi down-home Irish
( harm to Dinkelspiel. Hand mem
bers introduced the (iaelii tunes
with a whimsical overview of the
song's content. I'll is is apparently
a tradition tor Irish and American
audiences, because the lyrics ot
traditional songs tend to be
sketches of situations and emo
tions rather than comprehensible
slot ies.
Allan sings in English .is well as
(iaelic, and though the English
tunes sounded completely differ
ent from the guttural consonants
and sliding vowels of those in
C iaelic, the effect was the same.
The band joked on stage, seem
ing completely at ease with its au
dience of newfound friends. At
one point, Tourish introduced a


You'll never gef me lucky charms
reel .is "sort ot an all-purpose
time. You can sing 'Michael Row
1 he Boat Ashore' to it."
During the second act, the

hand actn.ilh persuaded the
somewhat geriatric audience to
stand and sing the thorns <>la
Kohhie Burns epic: "C.reen
grow the rushes, oh/(ireen
grow the rushes/ I he sweetest
hours that ere 1 spent / Were
spent among the lassies, oh."
I he plaintive melody, in the
Dorian mode like so much tra
ditional Irish music, rang out

from the audience like an audi
tor\ wave of nostalgia.
Dining die rest ol the < oncert,
listeners tapped their feet,
clapped to the musit and
even stood for the last feu songs
ol the second set. It was clear
that, whether or not they had
taken Mhaonaigh's advice to go
gel .i pint during the intermis
sion. the audience members all

responded to the infectious
melodies and driving heats of the
Irish dances.
Allan's current tour was un
dertaken to promote its newest
album. "Another Sky." Ihe
on it are more complex
and more fiddle-oriented than
some of their earlier albums but
are |ust as spirited, wistful and
exciting as their previous songs.

( >n tins allium, the\ delve into
ih-w types ol matet i.il. 11it hiding
some modern Irish and a
version ol "(»irl from North
Country" b\ Hob Dylan, .is well
as a lull complement ol tradition
al tunes. 11 their concert is any in
dication ol the caliher ol the
alhum, it should be a fabulous
oeuvre, lull ol texture, lilt and
passion.
