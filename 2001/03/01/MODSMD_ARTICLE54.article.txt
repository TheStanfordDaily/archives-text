on the night ol Feb. 21.
Alt au's repertoire consists ola
combination ol unusual northern
Ii ish flute tunes and old Donegal
fiddle music. The band was
formed in Donegal in the mid
'80s In lead singei and fiddler
Mairead Ni Mhaonaigh and her
husband, flutist Frankie
kennedx . I hex added a group ol
music ians to the growing ensem
ble. who were all old friends ol the
couple.
Over the years, the group
added and exchanged members

and suffered the loss of Ken tied v.

the c urrent arrangement, which
includes Daithi Sproule on gin

Allan's sound is lull

greatest asset is
Mhaonaigh's voice
pure, wistful and
achingly c lear, con-

vexing the tone of a song even

Although accor

passages were breathtaking,
whereas, in other songs. Ins ac
cordion contributed a welcome
wind-instrument tone to the oth
erwise string-dominated band.
In addition to the baud's im
passioned plaving, Alt.in brought
a touch oi down-home Irish
( harm to Dinkelspiel. Hand mem
bers introduced the (iaelii tunes
with a whimsical overview of the
song's content. I'll is is apparently
a tradition tor Irish and American
audiences, because the lyrics ot
traditional songs tend to be
sketches of situations and emo
tions rather than comprehensible
slot ies.
Allan sings in English .is well as
(iaelic, and though the English
tunes sounded completely differ
ent from the guttural consonants
and sliding vowels of those in
C iaelic, the effect was the same.
The band joked on stage, seem
ing completely at ease with its au
dience of newfound friends. At
one point, Tourish introduced a
