# Get in on the action before the Start-Ups.comedy go public
## 
### TIFFANY LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When my friends and I got to the
Rooster V. Feathers Comedy Club
in Sunnyvale five minutes before
the Start-l'ps.comedy show was set
to begin, we were greeted with a
line of people — mostly 25-year
olds .ind above, all with reserva
tions, waiting to get in.
I lie club itself was small and inti
mate, which provided the audience
dI the sold-out show with a good view
d| the stage. The decor of the club
was nothing less than eclectic. I he
multi-colored lights that surrounded
the stage and front wall flashed in be
tween ads. and huge figurines lined
the walls of the building.
I could feel the energy of the
»iowd when we sat down. People
were t each to have a good time, and
the\ were reach to laugh whether
the comedians were funn\ or not,
w hit li was fortunate, given some of
the ac ts that we saw th.it night.
Alter a couple intro skits, the

main event came on stage: Start
ups.comedy, an appropriate
name fora group performing in
the Silicon Valley. If you enjen
watching the show. "Who's Line
is it Anyway?," you will find this
group entertaining. Although
not quite as good .is the I V show,
the Start-ups.comedy ensemble
plays tbt* same kind of improvisa
tional games with the same de
gree of enthusiasm.
I don't know il it was the crowd
that evening or il it was a represen
tation of human nature, but the sex
ual tension was rampant through
out the entire performance. Kverv
thiug seemed to be coming up sex.
1 he first improvisation.il ac t the
group did involved the pel lorniers
playing doctors who were giving
advice to members ol the audient e.
I he catch? Kadi inquiring audi
ence member could onh sa\ a sin
gle word about their "condition."
When the lights dimmed in an
ticipation of the opening act — a
waitress who woi ked at the club

people were all too eager lor the
show to start. Her jokes were not
particularly futinv. lhe\ lacked
originality, and I often caught her
enjoving her jokes more than the
crowd did.
The man who followed her per
formance was considerably more
entertaining. I le stepped on to the
stage with his shaved head and a
bottle ol water and brought the
house to its knees with a comical
rendition of channel-surfing, as
well as his imitations of movie stais
such as |ohn Malkovic hand Robert
I VN'iro.
Although the show itsell was not
the funniest I've ever seen, it was
definiteh entertaining. II \ou have
nothing to do on a Krida) night or
are looking for something close In
that will provide vou with a few
bout sol luu and laughtei. vou can
find it at the Roostei I feathers
