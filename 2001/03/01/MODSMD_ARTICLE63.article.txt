II I told von that the new Nin
tendo (>•! game "Conker's Bad
I in Da)" features as its protago
nist .1 little red squirrel who wan
ders around in a land where a
hum li of talking animals are try
ing to work through a bunch of
animal-land problems, you
would probably assume that this
game is meant for children and
bettei lelt to the Pokemon-buy
ing crowd. Oh, how wrong vou
would be.
Conker's Bad Fur Day" is
trul) an exercise in genius, pub
lished In the gaming masters at
Rare, a I nited Kingdom-based
developer responsible for such
\() 112 classics .is "(loldeneye" and
I'ei feet Dark." What sets
( duiker's" apart from yout aver
age platlormer is its adult
tliemed humor.
II vou thought constant curse
words, bloody animal parts and
loads of excrement were things
vou'd never be able to find 111 a
game distributed by Nintendo of
\tnerica. then "Conker's" shows
H »st how fat the company has
come in trying to match other
gaming consoles in targeting an
older audience. With the release
of (.onket 's." Nintendo has suc
ceeded with flying colors.
I he game itself is a 512-
niegabit behemoth packed with

smooth animation, tons <>1 cine
ma sequences, high-<jualit\ musi(
you wouldn't ever expect out of a
cartridge game and enough sell
referential humor and pop-* nl
ture parod) to make vou lee I like
you're watching a good "Simp
sons" episode.
I lie Kntertaimnent Software
Ratings Board lias slapped this

bad bov with an "M" rating
(Mature) — the video game
e<|iiivalent of a rated-R
movie — and it's easy to see
why.
The premise is simple
enough. After de( idmg to
get piss drunk instead of
hanging out with Herri, his
girlfriend, (lonker the squir
rel blacks out and wakes up
hung over and puking. As
the player, controlling
Conker is like anv other *1-1)
action / platform game: Run,
jump and use a weapon,
which for Conker happens
to be a large fry ing pan.
(lonker can also use his
tail to hover for short (lis-

tances. and lit* uses other
items ih.it appeal depending on
his particular situation. ('.tinker
is trying to make it to Herri's
plate, while .it the same time,
the (ire.it Panther King is trying
to capture (.tinker as a replace
ment fora tahle leg so his milk
won't spill. If this sounds weird,
it's just the beginning.

Mil- characters and environ
nu'nls Conker encounters are
what makes this game uni<|ue,
almost shot kindly so .it times.
Dung beetles reside in a world
ol poo which you must na\ igate
through after putting on a gas
mask. Sometimes, von need to
chug a hunch ol liquor and then
piss on youi enemies. Alter-

ward, von need Alka-selt/.er to
l in e your hangover.
One end-boss must be delimit
ed by knocking Ins oversized
brass halls with some hrii ks. while
anothet boss loses his clothing
and gets embarrassed in front ol
an arena crowd because lie has a
small penis. And then there's a

< lot k ( that gets oil when you
sin k female gears around his pro
(Hiding levers. All the while,
characters cuss you out (the f
word is bleeped out hut nothing
else in), and thev sometimes get
mangled into blood\ heaps oi
llesh and hones. 1 lie toilet
hutnot and innuendo serve to
amuse throughout and are in
deed the selling point ol the
game.
(>! (ourse, a game hased solely
on novelty value wouldn't he
worth pla\ ing lor very long, and
"Conker's" certainly oilers a lot
ol solid gameplay accentuated
with beautiful graphics. 1 lie
usual Mario-style pu//le-solving
elements are interspersed with
other gameplay elements
suiting ovei hot lava, eating
cavemen on a harnessed raptor,
shooting bees with a machine
gun and goring cows while rul
ing a bull, jusi to name a lew
keep the game feeling fresh and
interesting.
What really takes this game to
another level, however, are the
countless movie parodies, skill
lulb woven into the plot and .ill
extremely lunnv. I he game be
gins with (lie opening music from
"A (iloc kwork ()range," complete
with a (lose-up ol ('.onker s face a
la Malcoin McDowell. There are
direct movie quotes ("Aliens")
and scene references (" The Un
touchables") and sometimes boss

e.s or enemies are dim l lilm ii|)
oils (" I'lie Terminator").
During one great se<|iienie.
Conker and Berri obtain slow
motion bullet-dodging capabili
ties like in " I he Matrix' and al
most perfectly recreate the
Keauu Reeves C'.arrie-Anne
Moss hallwa\ se<|uence from the
movie. 11 vou'i e into film rei ogni
tion, this ,tsj)e( t ol "Conker's"
boosts its entertainment value ex
ponentially.
I he game is not perfect, of
course; "Conkers' suffers from
monotom ol tasks from time to
time, as well as being extremeb
diHit nit. It also has a four-plavet
multiplayer mode that tries to im
itate the success of "(loldeneye"
vat ions death-mate h-escpie
scenarios within various level
maps but its slow frame rate
and unresponsive pla\ control
cannot compare to the gloi \ (01
fun) of the single-player game
and its movie-like immersion.
Nevertheless, "Conker's bad
Fur Day" is a reason to break
out the aging Nintendo til in its
dying days and put it to good
use, and it almost gives you faith
tb.it in the future, Nintendo
won't assume people stop play
ing video games once they get
to college. We're a crowd to be
marketed to, and these are the
types of games we w ant to plav.


Bad squirrel, no rabies
