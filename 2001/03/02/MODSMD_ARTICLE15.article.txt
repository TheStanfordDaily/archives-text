I liesc cultural events are especial Iv
attractive to freshmen w ho ai e new to

Part of the reason for high partici

Stanford's spraw ling campus and em

fit st-vear experieiu es ncc essarilv dot -
mitorv-based. Attending a /oot Suit
event in Casa /apata lounge, we no
ticed that a large number of people in
the audience were ethnic and non
ethnic Casa Zapata freshmen.
While students from other dormito
ries are obviouslv encouraged to par
ticipate in these cultural events, fresh
men who live in ethnic theme houses
need only be open-minded and curi
ous about .in event to attend. M'ter all,
they already live in the houses.
For many freshmen of color, living
in an ethnic theme dormiton is possi
bly their first and onlv opportunity to
reside in a coininunitv where lhe\ are
of the majority. I rue, a number of in
coming students come from ethnic
communities, but these students are a
tinv percentage of the freshman c lass
each year.
Most freshmen come from towns
and cities where the majoritv ol the
population is white. I lie chance to
live with people of one* own race and
ethnicity in a supportive environment
is an exciting and important part of
the Stanford experience that should
not be denied.
The reverse ol this situation also
exists. Kthnic theme dormitories facil
itate the transition for main students
of color into the Stanford community,
especially freshmen. What main per
ceive as the Stanford c ulture of afllu
ence, privilege and trips to lahoc is

lodcnv Ireslunen residence in etli

the immense influence that race has
on people's lives. Some believe t hat as
signing random housing for fresh
men leaves everyone s housing expe
rience to chance. but the realitv is that
freshmen of color will still be the mi
norities in theii houses. I hat situation
is anvthing but random.

and 1.7 percent American Indian.
Practicallv speaking, Ireslunen ol
coloi who desire ethnic support ni.iv
not be able to find oi c reate an ethnic
communitv within their dormitories.
Stanford's expansive campus and
residence-based education is such
that most freshmen will, generallv
speaking, draw most ol their aca
demic and social support Iroin within
their dormitories.
Bevond this, racial quotas should
be eliminated from ethnic theme
houses. In older to create a safe and
comfortable environment for resi
dents of these dormitories, it is impor
tant that everyone who lives there
wants to be there* Indeed, a few hos
tile residents could potentially trans
form a sec ure romnmnitv into an un
pleasant one. I herefore, all residents
of ethnic theme houses should specif
ically request housing there.
While it is important that people be
allowed to live in ethnic theme dorms
when tliev are not of that race or eth
nicity. people of that race and ethnic i
tv should have priority when being
placed in the house.
Some argue that allowing onlv up
perclassmen to live in ethnic theme
residences will lulp strengthen the
ethnic community because these stu
dents chose to draw into the specific
theme dormitory. I his idea is unreal
istic for two reasons. First, upperc lass
men tend to be much busier than
freslunen and not as likelv to attend
dormiton programming.
Many upperrlassincn say they
have their hands full juggling classes,
participating in extracurricular ac
tivities and making time for old
friends. I hev have enough to do
without attending dormitory events.
This is true in anv number of dormi
tories, not just ethnic theme houses.
Without freshmen in ethnic theme
dormitories, the programming that
is fundamental to the purpose of
theme houses might be jeopardized
In lack of attendance.
Second, a number of ethnic: theme

dormitories exist in residences stu
dents have traditionally deemed un
desirable. Some theme dormitories
have older facilities smaller rooms
and less convenient locations. Dormi
tories can be popular or unpopular
with upperclassmen for reasons in
dependent of whether or not they
have ethnic programming. For ex
ample, Wilbur Hall, which houses
()kada, consistently draws high num
bers every year. Unless Residential
Education decides to change the lo
cation of several ethnic theme hous

es, expecting upperclassmen to forgo
"good" housing to live in theme resi
dences is unrealistic.
Regardless of the fact that they are
new to campus, freshmen should be
given the opportunity to live in eth
nic theme dormitories precisely be
cause they are trying, and sometimes
struggling, to adjust to the Stanford
environment. It is Stanford's re
sponsibility to facilitate the transition
to college for freshmen, and ethnic
theme dorms are an essential part of
this support structure. To deny
freshmen housing in ethnic theme
houses is to denv them the tight to
join their community and learn
about their culture in a comfortable
and positive way.

Stanford's expansive campus and
residence-based education is such
that most freshmen will, generallv
speaking, draw most ol their aca
demic and social support Iroin within
their dormitories.
Bevond this, racial quotas should
be eliminated from ethnic theme
houses. In older to create a safe and
comfortable environment for resi
dents of these dormitories, it is impor
tant that everyone who lives there
wants to be there* Indeed, a few hos
tile residents could potentially trans
form a sec ure romnmnitv into an un
pleasant one. I herefore, all residents
of ethnic theme houses should specif
ically request housing there.
While it is important that people be
allowed to live in ethnic theme dorms
when tliev are not of that race or eth
nicity. people of that race and ethnic i
tv should have priority when being
placed in the house.
Some argue that allowing onlv up
perclassmen to live in ethnic theme
residences will lulp strengthen the
ethnic community because these stu
dents chose to draw into the specific
theme dormitory. I his idea is unreal
istic for two reasons. First, upperc lass
men tend to be much busier than
freslunen and not as likelv to attend
dormiton programming.
Many upperrlassincn say they
have their hands full juggling classes,
participating in extracurricular ac
tivities and making time for old
friends. I hev have enough to do
without attending dormitory events.
This is true in anv number of dormi
tories, not just ethnic theme houses.
Without freshmen in ethnic theme
dormitories, the programming that
is fundamental to the purpose of
theme houses might be jeopardized
In lack of attendance.
Second, a number of ethnic: theme

dormitories exist in residences stu
dents have traditionally deemed un
desirable. Some theme dormitories
have older facilities smaller rooms
and less convenient locations. Dormi
tories can be popular or unpopular
with upperclassmen for reasons in
dependent of whether or not they
have ethnic programming. For ex
ample, Wilbur Hall, which houses

bers every year. Unless Residential
Education decides to change the lo

"good" housing to live in theme resi
dences is unrealistic.
Regardless of the fact that they are

to college for freshmen, and ethnic
theme dorms are an essential part of
this support structure. To deny
