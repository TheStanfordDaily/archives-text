El IINIC 1 HKMK HOI'SKS
are an indispensable j>ait
ol the Stanford coniniuni
tv. both for their role in
fulfilling the mission of Residen
tial Education, as well as serving
their own residents. Freshmen
have many opportunities to find
their place in Stanford's ethnic
communities without living in eth
nic theme dormitories, and stu
dents should not be forced to live
in communities in which tliev are
uncomfortable.
Simplv put, freshmen should not be
able to live in ethnic theme houses.
There are main wavs to le.u n about di
versity during freshman year without
living in ethnic theme houses. Further
more, placing freslunen in other resi
dences prov ides more space for upper
classmen who want the experience of
living in ethnic theme dormitories.
One major advantage of an ethnic
theme house is the feeling of safety, se
curity and belonging it prov ides — fea
tures that all students deserve in their
residences. Freslunen are struggling —
often for the first time — with an un
precedented degree ol independence,
and the) need a residence in which they
feel comfortable.
But these comforts c an be realized in
anv variety of wav s. Before enrolling, in
coming students can opt to have a
roommate of the same ethnicity if they
feel that such a living situation would
make the transition easier.
Realistically, some freslunen may de
cide that their housing arrangements
do not provide a desirable ethnic cli
mate. However, opportunities abound
for them to find such an environment
In joining an ethnic group on campus,
attending their events or even going
over to the ethnic theme houses for
meals or functions.
Much of the purpose of college is to
have novel experiences and encounter
new people. Through its wealth of di
versity (not just of an ethnic nature),
Stanford certainly provides sue h oppor
tunities. Indeed, a wide varictv of differ
ent communities exist at this I niversitv,
and it would be a shame for students not
to have, or worse, to forsake, the chance
to participate in at least a few of them.
While it is true that proximitv breeds
friendship, it would hardly be reason
able to that students onlv develop
tight relationships with those in their
residences. 1 here are simplv too many
other outlets for meeting people and
sharing common experiences .it this
school.
In fact, freshmen's most essential
bonding experience is not dorm-based,
but rather a matter of shared circum
stance Kvcrvone has to take Introduc
tion to the I iumanities courses. Kverv
onc can go to Full Moon on the Quad.
Kvcrvone can attend Flicks. Kvcrvone
gets randomly tossed into dormitories
with others whose backgrounds span
the gamut of race, ethnicity, socioeco
nomic status, interests and experience.
»lupcftiilt. most freslunen develop a

sense of pride about where thev live and
bond with their classmates within and
outside of their resident es.
Community comes in a variety ol
forms and, if ethnic theme houses pro
vide the necessary community for some
freshmen, there are many ways to act ess
that without actually living there. It tliev
trulv cherish the environment, fresh
men can always choose to live in ethnic
theme houses for the remainder of their
Stanford careers.
Some argue that it is essential for
freshmen to actually live in ethnic
theme houses because of the and
enthusiasm freshmen bring to event
planning lhai busier, more apathetic
upperclassmen lack. In response, it is
worth noting that freshmen are as in
volved in campus life as anyone, jug
gling classes, activities and relationships
like their older counterparts.
Moreover, the fact that upperclass
men choose to live in these dorms sug
gests that thev have the passion to con
tinue the dynamic residence program
ming that lias come to characterize
Stanford's ethnic theme houses.
Bevond the vitality and purpose of
ethnic theme houses are a variety of lo
gistical issues about the living arrange
ments. As it stands now, with the class
and ethnic quotas the University main
tains for ethnic theme dormitories,
many freshmen are arbitrarily placed
into ethnic theme houses — sometimes
against their will — while upperclass
men who \\ isli to draw into those hous
es are denied spaces.
Not allowing freshmen to live in eth
nic theme houses — just as they cannot
live in any other kind of theme house
like La Casa Italiana, La Maison
Franchise or I laus MittleEuropa — will
make space available for the upper
classmen who want to be there.
I he proponents of allowing fresh
men to live in ethnic theme houses
argue fallaciously tli.it upperclassmen
will be reluctant to sac rifice Draw prior
ity and the possibility of "good" housing
for an implicitly "bad" ethnic theme
house.
Certainly, the Draw requires students
to make difficult decisions about where
and with whom to live. But why should
we assume that the potential to have
one's own room or an open kitchen
would outweigh the benefits of commu
nity support and feelings of comfort
tli.it ethnic theme house residents say
makes their dorm experiences so
worthwhile?
\ student's housing should enhance,
not limit his or her experience of diver
sity. Without implying that ethnic
theme houses are insular or exclusive,
freshmen who live in ethnic theme
dorms nia\ actually have less exposure
to different kinds of people. Some argue
that freshmen are more open to new
experiences and perspectives, making
them more receptive to the cultural
viewpoints expressed in ethnic theme
houses.
But this remains a tenuous assump
tion at best. In fact, it is more appropri
