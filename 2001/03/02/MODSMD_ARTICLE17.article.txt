## Choosing your 'ending' 
### 
Even single conversation I've had
about the movie, "Crouching
Tiger, Hidden Dragon," re
volved around two themes. First
comes the gut reaction to Zhang Zivi.
"She's so hot!" is fairly tvpical, as is, "I've
just developed an Asian fetish." Rarer, but
still heard, is, "I'm moving to China."
1 hen conies the intellectual response.
I here's only one thing you can respond
to: the ending. The verv hot, emigration
inducing heroine says good-bye to her
lover and hurls herself Off a mountaintop

into the mists below.
All my friends say it
isn't suicide. I'hev point
to the fact that the last
words of the film are "a
faithful heart makes
wishes come true," a
saying that, in the film,
has magical death-defV
ing properties. They
point to the heroine's

superhuman abilities. If she can leap tall
bamboo stalks in a single bound, she can
survive a fall from a mountain. The point
of the ending, they sav, is the redemptive
power of love and faithfulness.
Well, that's .ill wrong.
It was suicide. She does kill herself. It's
not a "happy ending."
Now, people hate th.it. They want
happy endings. It gives them a better
sense of closure. A happy ending is more
of a...we 11, ending. Everyone gets his or
her heart's desire, and there is no more to
be said. Curtains, credits, fade to black.
Contrast this with the "tragic ending."
When everyone's desires have vet to be
fulfilled, why then, something better can
happen. We can fight against "tragedy."
()r so Americans think.
In America, vow can fight against everv
and any sort of tragedv. Low wages get
you down? Labor union action! Industri
alization drives you mad? Environmental
protection lobbies! Low grades on vour
midterm? Argue with the LA!
Americ a is the land of opportunity. As
long as you have the drive, the talent and
the sheer determination, vou c an succeed.
Common sense is no barrier. You can
drink 32-ounce sodas, a feat that would
burst lesser bladders. Everything is possi
ble; it's the American way!
At McDonald's, Happv Meals. In life,
happy endings.
1 lappv endings in America are a matter
of entitlement. It's a constitutional right. If
a country's politics reflects its national cul
ture, then this is a nation thirsting for hap
piness. We've set up our political institu
tions to engineer happy endings.
Lake democracy, for example. Ameri
can democracy is like a 11oily wood film. It

has one single purpose: produce happy
endings. The Constitution enforces limits
on presidential and congressional terms.
This creates a vast load of endings for po
litical careers. Why create armies of ex
politicians? So thev can write memoirs
about the happv endings of their careers,
of course. Arthur Schlesinger jr., Henn
Kissinger and Patrick Movnihan. People
want happy endings.
But what's the big deal? What's wrong
with happiness?
Well, it just ain't beautiful. 1 lappv end
ings are bland, they're tasteless and
they're dead boring. The\ have no aes
thetic value. That makes them worthless.
Tragic endings, bv contrast, are always
artistic, Thev're powerful, dramatic and
have panache. F.ven a master artist like
Shakespeare relies on tragic endings for
aesthetic value. Would you rather King
lx-ar live happily with his three doting
daughters? Imagine Othello telling Des
demona, "You and me, babv, let's make
this marriage work. Let's have kids!" Now
think of Shakespeare's comedies. Do vou
even like "The Merchant of Venice"?
The truth is that Happv Endings kill
the individual.
Tolstoy pointed this out in Anna
Karenina: "Happy families are all alike;
even unhappy family is unhappv in its
own way." Happiness is conformity. You
can onlv be happy in one way. There
aren't any shades or nuances to happi
ness. How do vou feel every time vou're
happy?
The same damn wav.
Tragedy — now that happens in infi
nite ways. Tragic endings call for wit, in
vention and creativitv. Nobodv dies in
quite the same manner— Hamlet, Lear,
Othello or our very hot, emigration-in
ducing heroine in "('.t ouching Tiger, Hid
den I )t agon." A tragic ending expresses a
particular circumstance and a particular
identitv. It calls for individualism.
That's why rebellion is a deeplv unhap
pv thing. Your average goth in black
leather wears a deep scowl because she
subconsciously understands the con
fbrmism of happv endings. Rebels seek
tragic endings — terrorism, suicide and
soon. Happiness means assimilation into
the rest of America.
So be careful about happv endings.
Thev re uglv, boring and anti-art. When
vou desire happy endings, vour life be
comes bland and devoid of any interest
whatsoever. For vou as an individual, it'll
be curtains, credits and fade to black.
