Speakers Bureau
responds to column
1 would like to respond to Arisha
Hatch's column in yesterday's Dail\ re
garding the lee!ure In Maya Angelou. ()n
behalf of the ANSI Speakers Bureau, I am
truly sorry that Hatch had a negative ex
perience trving to meet Dr. Angelou.
We make even effort to let as mam stu
dents as possible meet the speakers we
bring to campus. Dr. Angelou was asked to
participate in a reception open to .ill stu
dents after the lecture, but she declined.
She was asked to do .1 book signing but 1 e
fused tli.it as well.
She agreed to meet with no more than
10 students and sign 110 11101 e than 12
books for about 10 minutes before the lec
ture. Those students were chosen In the
Assistant Dean of Students and Dircctoi of
the Black Conimunit\ Services (lentei in
as democratic a wav as possible." in as
democratic a wa\ as possible. In the past,
speakers who agreed to do so have partic
ipated in book signings and open recep
tions after the lectures.
It is unfortunate that Dr. Angelou de
cided against doing so. but it w.is hei dec 1-
sion and not ours. 1 hope that 1 latch un
derstands the difficult situation we faced
111 tr\ing to provide .1 positive expei ience
for the whole Stanford conununitv. Again,
1 .tin trulv sorry if hers was anything less
than that.

Daily article includes
'conservative propaganda'
We cannot let something like Wednes
day's front-page article, "First Lack to
speak on education," go without a re
sponse. Unfortunately, the writer did not
iiu lude anything other than conservative
propaganda. 1 lie article describes .1 stuck
"arguing that blacks and Hispanic s have
the most to gain from greatei use ot
school vouchers." It does not point out
the contentiousness ot this debate, nor re
position ol those of us who argue that
school vouchers have ac tuallv been show 11
to aid the wealthiest of America's
schoolchildren, oftentimes white, upper
class surburbians. Vouchers clo not an

swer 0111 educational problems.
In addition, the writer describes the
Hoover Institution's goals as seeking to
"sec lire and safeguard peace, improve the
human condition and limit government
intrusion into the lives of individuals."
Ibe Stanford Democrats would argue,
however, that the limitation of govern
ment intrusion is indeed detrimental to
the human condition. I lie Hoover Insti
tution certainb does not have the last sa\
in this inattei. \s I)enioc rats, we, too, sup
port the niaintenaiu e of peace and the im
provement of the human condition — but
we believe the govci nineiit can serve a kc\
role in ibis process.

Solution to White Plaza
speakers 'absurd'
I was distui bed by tlu- 1 ).ul\'s proposal
"White I'la/a speakers often too aggres
sive (Feb. 27). Fvcryboch can agree that
the outside speakers 111 White I'la/a are
often outspoken and controversial. These
solicitors can often be annoying or, in the
extreme, lun .issing. That said, the editori
al's solution—to control solicitors with a
constant police presence —is absurd.
I n st, the editorial justifies its proposals
In claiming that these advocates violate
students' rights, which "should also in
clude safe,»onifbi table travel to and from
class." I o m\ knowledge, there is 110 legal
document on the federal, state, local or
Universitx level that guarantees people
the right to feel "comfortable." It is uncon
scionable to suggest that students have the
"right" to be protected from anything out
side their comfort /ones. In our lives, we
will all find people who make us uncom
fortable, people who disagree with us and
people who hate us.
Weill. i\ choose to confront them or dis
miss them, but we cannot claim the right to
be insulated from them, especially while
paving lip service to "free speech."
The editorial moves on to recommend
police surveillance to crack down on "ag
gressive individuals." It argues," The Stan
ford Police patrols parties, athletic events
and the Foothills, but White I'la/a remains

uncomfortably devoid of University pres
ence." l be Foothills and athletic events are
under extreme authoritarian control — is
this what we want for White I'la/a? I he
campus erupted 111 protest earlier this year
when the University installed police check-,
points at the entrances to the Foothills.
And recall Big Game one veai ago,
when a team of police in riot gear mart lied
onto the field to intimidate the student sec -
lion for the last quarter of the game. 1 he
Daily claims to find White Pla/a "uncom
fortably devoid of University presence,"
but I find it quite refreshing.
I here are many legitimate reasons tor
using the police to monitor public space. A
police presence can often prevent crimes
and protect people s safety. However, the
editorial seeks police control of White
Pla/.a to ensure the comfort of students.
I his overreact ion would limit everybody's
freedom. In a democratic society, this idea
is dangerously absurd.

Removing Nike logo from
athletic uniforms is 'just lame'
1 feel compelled to respond to An gad
Bhalla's comments about the Stanford
Athletic Department's relationship to
Nike. Bhalla wants Stanford to "remove
the swoosh from every article of athletic
clothing." I'll is is just lame. I fail to see how
this solves any of Bhalla's issues against the-
Nike corporation.
Stanford Athletic s relies on Nike to pro
vide the best athletic apparel and equip
ment. As a former Stanford varsity athlete,
I can speak for niv team in voicing our ap
preciation for Nike and their support for
our athletic department. I didn't feel like
niv freedom of expression was compro
mised In wearing a tew Nike swooshes on
mv clothes. Bhalla makes a good point that
Stanford and the Athletic Department are
not political entities. I he Athletic Depart
ment does .m extraordinary job doing
what it does. If Bhalla wants to embark on
a personal crusade against Nike, that's his
business, but to call for the removal of
swooshes is nonsense.
