Delshan Tyette Hanks, special programs coordinator for the LGBCC, is one
of many involved in the center's renaming process.
"Five wars ago, only 600 peo
ple could go. and people would
sleep out fbi two days" to get those
tickets. In addition, "the location

of the ticket sale was not an
nounced until two days before and
changed every year . . . getting
tickets was the hardest thing in the
world."
I his year's earls sell-out with
twice as many tickets brings Stan
ford's enthusiasm for the Vien
nese Ball to .111 all-time high.
