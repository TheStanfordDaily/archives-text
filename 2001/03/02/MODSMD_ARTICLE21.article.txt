### 
WASHINGTON (AT)
The Census Bureau urged
Commerce Set ret.n \ Don
I vans vesterda\ to approve lite
use ot raw population numbers
from the 2000 count tor con
gressional redisricting, despite
estimates that H.l million Anier
i( ans, primal ily minorities, wet e
overlooked.
Kvans will now weigh die rec
ommendation from William
Barron, the bureau's acting di
rector, and advice from outside
experts .uul will make ilic- final
decision b\ Tuesda\ whether to
have the numbers statistical
adjusted.
I he bureau's recommenda
tion will be "a critical element ot
m\ deliberations." Kvans said.
lbs choice could have broad
political implications: It ap
proved, adjusted data could be
used .is the b.isis tbi redrawing
not onlv congressional districts
but state and legislative district
boundaries.
In a memo to Kvans. Barron
said he agreed with a Census
Bureau committee's recom
mendation urging the use of
raw numbers.
" I he committee reached tins
recommendation because it is
unable, based on data and otliei
information currenth available,
to conclude that the adjusted
data are more accurate for use in
redisricting," Barron said.
Most Democrats and civil
rights groups have claimed that
a census adjustment would bet
ter account tor millions missed
in the count, lnostlv minorities,
the poor and children.
But Republicans countered
that an adjustment could inject
more errors into a 2000 count
that proved to be more accu
rate than 1990 s. I liev also in
sist the Constitution's demand
for "actual enumeration" of the
population everv 10 wars bats
alterations.
According to the Census Bu
reau's report to Kvans. a surve\
following the census estimated a
net undercount in 2000 of 1.2
percent of Americans, or about
million people. That was
down from 1.6 percent of the
1990 population, or about 1 mil
lion people, in the previous
head count.
The survey, which used sam
pling methods, also generally
found that smaller percentages

ot mil km Hies and (hilclren were
missed ilns time than in 1990.
Toi example:
I lie net undeic omit foi
American Indians and \laska
Natives liMiig on reservations
dec lined from 12.22 percent m
1990 to 1.7 t percent in 2000.
I lu- net unclcrcount tor
Hispanics decreased from 4.99
percent in 1990 to 2.85 percent
in 2000.
I lowever. ci itic s pointed out
that the undercount foi most
ininoriix groups was neverthe
less larger overall than tor
whites: the net undercount for
whites decreased slight 1\". from
0.08 percent to 0.07 percent.
" The c in il rights community
is deep!\ disappointed bv
ioda\ s announcement." said
Wade I lendci son, executive di
rector of the Keadership ( on
ference on ( i\ il Rights. "As a re
sult of todav's decision, these
(ommunities. one e again, will be
underrepresented in tlu- na
tion's electoral process."
Republicans c laimed victorv.
"Came. Set. Match..' read the
headline of a release from Rep.
D.in Miller, R-Ma., c ban man of
the I louse C iovcrnmeiit Reform
('.ommittee's census panel.
" Tins i econimend.ition bv
the Census Bureau experts
should settle the matter once
and foi all." Miller said.
I he ( 'ensus Bureau commit
tee report said results from the
"Ac c urac v and ( overage Kvalu
ation." a follow-up survev of
HI 1,000 households following
the census, conflicted with re
sults from a separate demo
graphic analvsis usuallv per
formed after a census to mea
sure its accuracy.
"After careful consideration
of the data, this committee has
concluded that there is consid
erable evidence to support the
use of adjusted data, and that
the ( ensus 2000 and A.( I.E. op
erations were well-designed and
conducted." the report said.
However, a comparison to
demographic anal\ si* and other
possible errors "preclude a de
termination at this time that the
adjusted data are more accu
rate," it said.
Barron said some of the dis
