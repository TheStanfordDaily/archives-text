# Quake damage reaches $2 billion
## 
### 
SKATI Lh (AP) — I hc damage estimate from
the Northwest earthquake climbed to $2 billion
yesterday as engineers inspected bridges, build
ings, dams and roads. But the region congratu
lated itself lor escaping far worse damage.
Most people went about their lives as usual,
swapping stories about close calls during the most
powerful quake to hit Washington state in T>2
years. Few noticed two minor aftershocks early
yesterday, and no additional damage was
reported.
State emergency officials counted 1 J!72 injuries
directly linked to Wednesday's magnitude-6.8
quake, but most were minor and none critical.
"The biggest news is there is no news," Seattle
Mavor I'aul S< hell s.iid. "1 here aren't any fatali
ties. I lie damage, while serious, is not anything
like what people would have expected."
Despite the good news, (Jov. Gary Locke sub
mitted .1 formal request Thursday to President
Hush fora federal disaster declaration, which
would make federal aid available.
The earthquake was centered H. r > miles south
west of Seattle and miles underground. Scien
tists s.ml the depth of the quake eased its impact,
while municipal leaders said the millions of dol
lars spent stabilizing the region's highways and
buildings against earthquakes over the past
decade paid off.
Several homes were evacuated in a Tacoma
neighborhood because of danger from
mudslides.
In nearby Stcilacoom, more than 200 patients
at a state hospital for the criminally insane were
moved after inspectors declared the building un
safe. The patients were kept in a gymnasium
under guard Wednesday night.
In Olympia. the state capital south of Seattle,
several streets were blocked off as crews began

clearing away rubble. The Capitol complex re
mained closed, idling 10,000 workers, most of
them until Monday, when buildings were expect
ed to be inspected and cleaned.
Legislative leaders said they will determine
today whether the Capitol itself, with a crack
behind pillars supporting its dome, can be
used. They were scouting other sites in case the
Legislature has to relocate for the rest of the
session.
Most Seattle businesses and schools were open
yesterday as the city tried to return to normal.
The Seattle-'Tacoma International Airport —
its controllers forced into a trailer because of
damage to the tower — offered only limited ser
vice. Some bridges and roads remained closed.
Mary Hobson, a toll collector, said support
columns on Seattle's Alaskan Way Viaduct sepa
rated "like they were yawning" during the quake.
She said she won't drive on the viaduct.
"It creeps me out." she said. "1 can't imagine
the upper layer coming down. You'd be trapped
for sure."
Most of the Seattle damage was confined to in
dividual buildings. A building near Pioneer
Square was enclosed with scaffolding to prevent
falling bricks from hitting passers-by.
Just outside Seattle, Paula Vandorssen, 40, of
Maple Valley was driven from her home just sec
onds before it was hit by a quake-triggered
mudslide.
"This used to be my living room," Vandorssen
said, pointing through a window to the inside of
her house, which was filled past the windows with
mud and debris.
Sen. Patty Murray, l)-YVash., said the prelimi
narv damage estimate had reached $2 billion.
I he figure is expected to rise once lost wages and
lost business are added to property damage.
