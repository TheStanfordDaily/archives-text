WASIIINC; lON (AIM — Rat ing to do
President Ceorge \V. Bush's bidding,
House Republicans pushed across-the
board tax nits through committee ves
terdav, clearing the wav for .1 tloor vote
next week on the cornerstone of the new
administration's economic program.
The vote in the Ways and Means
Committee was 23-15, along part\ lines,
as Democ rats sharpl\ critic ized the bill .is
flawed and called the unusualh (jiiii k ac -
tion by the panel a poor omen for bipar
tisanship.
"Lssentialh what the president is
proposing is a pa\ raise for the- average
American," said Rep. Jen \ Wellerot Illi
nois, one of several Republicans on the
panel wlio argued the- bill would stimu
late theeconotm as well as provide relief
to taxpavers.
"I do not want to go back to the days
of deficit spending. I bis proposal puts
ns in that direction. ' countered Rep.
Michael McNultv. D-N.Y. (>thei Democ -
rats criticized Republicans for going
ahead before Congress agrees on an

overall plan for spending, debt retire
ment and tax cuts.
I he legislation, estimated to c osi $958
billion over a decade, would gradualh
reduce and condense tlu- current fi\e
graduated income tax rates of I 5 per
cent, 2S percent, 31 percent, 30 percent
and 39.0 percent. IU 2000. rates would
be pegged at 10 pet cent, 15 percent, 25
