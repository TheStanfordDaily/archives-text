The top-ranked women's water polo team, with Kris Koblik, above, opens conference play againsf
USC tonight at 7 p.m
.m\ ic.itn has stored on tlit* Car
dinal tins season.
I his potent offense is led In a
\ei\ experienced core, that, like
inanv teams in the conference,
including the Cardinal, consists
o! mam players who have partic
ipated on the international level.
I his includes team leader, ju
nior Aniko Pelle. who was a
member ot the Hungarian Na
tional I earn. She was also named
the top female water polo plaver
in the conntrv last vear and was
the \t I*S 1 2000 Plaver of the
Year. I 'SC. also boasts two mem
bers of the Ccnnan national
team and a member ot the Russ
ian national team.
"They have really good out
side shooters. In fact some of the
best shooters in the world." said
sophomore goalie |ackie Frank.
" I his week, we've been prac

ticing against the type of of
fense the\ run, and the biggest
change that we're going to
make is that we're going to put
more pressure on their outside
shooters."
Historically, the Cardinal lias
had trouble with the I rojans. In
1000, L SC. defeated Stanford in
the finals of the National Colle
giate Championships and
knocked them out of the 2000
tournament in the semifinals.
This, combined with the close
match last weekend, will make
today s match ver\ heated on
both sides of the pool.
Frank said that she feels that
the match-lip will be tough.
"Not only does t'SC [have] a
lot of pressure on it to win this
game, so they are going to be
very pumped up. but they are al
ready a very tough team to plav
because they are very aggressive
and physical," she said. "We are
going to need to stay focused and
keep playing the way we have to
be successful."
