son in the closing plays of the
game prevented the Cardinal
from maintaining its lead until the
final bnz/er.
"We had our opportunities
going down the stretch," said
head coach Tata VanDerveer.
"We had some very good shots
.iikl late looks at the free-throw
line, .md we didn't convert."
Stanford's inability to take
control of a game in which they
led the entire second half, espe
ci.illv on their home floor, poses
serious questions about the
strength of the team. All season
long, the Cardinal has struggled
to win the close ones, but, as the
postseason looms, the narrow de
feats are .ill the more devastating.
"I feel like our team just needs
to find who we are," Yamasaki
s.ud. "It is sad to sav because how
main games do we have left?
What is it going to take? How
many losses is it going to take?"
With three games remaining,
it is hard for anvone to say what
the Cardinal needs to do to keep
its NCAA Tournament dreams

alive. While nobo<l\ knows what
the selection committee is look
ing for when it comes time to fill
the final spots, the fact remains
that if Stanford fails to win at least
two of its final three, the team has
little more than a prayer.
VanDerveer has not had a sea
son without an NCAA appearance
since 1987, and she has just as
mam questions as her players
about how to get flic job done. The
head coach still speculates about
what the season might have been
like if not foi the loss of guards
|amie Carev and Susan King.
"People have to come
out . . . this is their race, the sea
son is on the line, vou can't be flat.
1 don't even see that as an option,"
VanDerveer said. "After the situa
tion with (amie and Susan, from
there we have fell like a team with
our backs against the wall. Every
night has been extremely chal
lenging."
However, after tonight's loss,
the Cardinal has little choice but
to get back on its horse to face
UCLA tomorrow.
"It's hard to say what we are
going to do now." Yamasaki said.
"It's getting to the point where we
have to put our foot down, and 1

VanDerveer has not had a sea
son without an NCAA appearance
since 1987, and she has just as
mam questions as her players
about how to get flic job done. The
head coach still speculates about
what the season might have been
like if not foi the loss of guards
|amie Carev and Susan King.
"People have to come
out . . . this is their race, the sea
son is on the line, vou can't be flat.
1 don't even see that as an option,"
VanDerveer said. "After the situa
tion with (amie and Susan, from
there we have fell like a team with
our backs against the wall. Every
night has been extremely chal
lenging."
However, after tonight's loss,
the Cardinal has little choice but
to get back on its horse to face
UCLA tomorrow.
"It's hard to say what we are
going to do now." Yamasaki said.
"It's getting to the point where we
have to put our foot down, and 1
don't know who's job it is to do
that."

"So far this season in the l'ac-10, even oppor

game prevented the Cardinal
from maintaining its lead until the

"We had our opportunities
going down the stretch," said
head coach Tata VanDerveer.
"We had some very good shots
.iikl late looks at the free-throw
line, .md we didn't convert."
Stanford's inability to take
control of a game in which they
led the entire second half, espe
ci.illv on their home floor, poses
serious questions about the
strength of the team. All season
long, the Cardinal has struggled
to win the close ones, but, as the
postseason looms, the narrow de
feats are .ill the more devastating.
"I feel like our team just needs
to find who we are," Yamasaki
s.ud. "It is sad to sav because how
main games do we have left?
What is it going to take? How
many losses is it going to take?"
With three games remaining,
it is hard for anvone to say what
the Cardinal needs to do to keep
its NCAA Tournament dreams

alive. While nobo<l\ knows what
the selection committee is look
ing for when it comes time to fill
the final spots, the fact remains
that if Stanford fails to win at least
two of its final three, the team has
little more than a prayer.
