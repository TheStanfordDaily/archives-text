I lie (urdiual has sailed through the
first six weeks of its season, running up a

impressive tii si month, including the
nation s best record against top-2f>
teams (.">-1), Stanford can no longer he

Behind stellai |>it t liing from its stall

son success. While this weekend's 11011-
conference dates at Sunken Diamond
nia\ have looked like a chance ft>i Ins
s(|iiatl to steal some wins from a strug
gling voung team, now the ('.olden Be. 11 s
(9-1) will have to face the hottest team in
the nation beginning tonight at Sunken
I )i.unt >nd.
Ifthere wasanv wav to replat e the de

parted trio of Jason Young, Justin
Wavnc and Brian Sager, Marquess
found it. I lis three st.u ters this season —
sophomores |ereni\ (.utlirie and Inn
(.unninghain and junioi |eff Bruksch
have gone 10-0 with a 2.31 I.RA and
mu//led hitters to a .198 average in the
shadow of the nation's most dominant
st.u ting staff in 2000.
(iutln ie's performance has been par
ticularh impressive considering his re
cent past. I lie fi-foot-l, 19r)-pound
sophomore had not picked up a bat in
two vcars before joining the (Cardinal in
the fall. After his Mormon mission to Bil

ex pet tations has supported (-inline and
C.onipanv, recenth putting up 29 runs
during the team's current four-game
winning streak and boasting six starters
with batting a vet ages above .3< >1).
I lie team's leader, junioi second
baseman Chris O'Riortlan, heads the
Stanford atiat k with a .391 average and
continues to come through with excel

are a testament to the signititanl powei
in the modcstlv-si/.ed O'Riordan's

is the ( animal s leadoll man.

best c hance to end that streak.
