I he \o. 5 Stanford women's gymnastics team
will lest its stamina with bat k-to-bat k meets when it
hosts No. IS Oregon Slate tonight and No. 18
Bi igham Young tomoi row in the coin Insion of its
home season.
I lead coach Mark (look is confident that the
gymnasts will he able to handle the l>ai k-to-bat k
meets, which are not typical foi the team.
"We are used to training hard in prat ti( e e\er\-
tla\. so this won't rcalh be anything newhe said.
" 1 will shuffle the lineup around a little to gi\e some
people at est and allow others to compete."
I he format will also help prepare the team tor na
tionals, which entails loin straight da\ sol < ompetition.
I he Cardinal (1-1. ;*-l Pacific 10 Conference)
( limbed rapidh through the rankings early in the
season and has now plateaued at a consistent le\el
of perfot mailt e.
"You kind of go through a cu le dui nig the sea
son, and now I think we are right w liet e we need to
be to hit oni peak at nation.lis.'' said junioi co-cap
tain l\at\ I lerbert.
Stanford holds the No. ."> spot tot the fourth
week in a row. I he ( animal is .ilso tanked in the
top 10 on all font c\cnts. holding its highest t.ink
ing, No. !l, on the beam.
1 liree gymnasts are tanked indi\itluallx on the
event, with seniot |en Kxaltat ion at fifth and fresh
men l .ise l.exeille and l.indsa\ Wing at ninth and
tenth, respecti\ el\.
Wing is now tied tot second in the all-around

.md ranks ninth on I lit' vault, whilc fellow freshman
('.at oline Muln cr is I Sth on the event.
\ftei a tough road win against Arizona last week,
the team looks forward to returning home to the
Stanford fans.
I he Cardinal will look to the crowd for support
in the meet against Oregon State (1-5, 0-3), wjiich
has a ficrcch competitive histon with Stanford.
After a home loss to Stanford during the regular
season last vear, the Beavers edged tlie ('.ardinal out
of a spot at nationals witli a narrow win at regionals.
"Oregon State wants us bad, so we really need to
get out there and show them we're a stronger team
this vear.'" (look said.
I lie Beavers had trouble with consistency earlv
in the season, but, two weeks ago, thev scored a sea
son-high 100.375, followed In 100.325, numbers
that are on pai with what Stanford has been scoring.
Oregon Slate now lias nationalh ranked gym
nasts on eac li event. Leading the way is senior Kat
rina Severin, w ho holds second on the vault and is
tied for 13th on the floor. Senior Stephanie Bv
ehowski is lied for fifth on the bars, and is ranked
1 Till on the beam.
Oregon State is the bigger threat, but Stanford
cannot discount BYI (4-1). I lie Cougars set a
school record two weeks ago when they scored
100.9 to beat Missouri.
|unior kellv Parkinson ranks fifth nationalh in
the all-around and recentb set a season high of
30.55. I he onl\ ( lougar to hold a national ranking,
the team relies heavih on Parkinson's consistent
pel forniance.
Stanford will not lake either of these teams for
granted, as the Cardinal fights to maintain us No. 5
stains going into the post-season.
" I hc\ are both formidable teams, and we will
need to do out job,' (look s.iid.
Both meets are st hcduled for 7:30 p.m. at Bm u
li.itn Pax ilion.
