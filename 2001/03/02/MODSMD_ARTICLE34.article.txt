This weekend's match might not be a day at the beach for Hie No. 5 men's volleyball team — its Hawaiian oppo
nents are No 6 in the nation
A jealous rage is probablv the tii st thing that tomes
to most people's minds when the\ hear that the Stan
ford men s volleyball team is spending this weekend in
Hawaii.
But, rest assured, the trip is all business loi the \o.
5 (Cardinal squad (8-2. 5-2 Mountain Pacifit Spoils
Federation).
Stanford starts a month-long si ret i h of road man li
es tonight with atl it it altonfercnce matt h against No.

tied for second in the fat ilit Div ision of the M I'SF, w ill
plav .ig.iin tomorrow night in a non-conference
match.
Both the ( .ardinal and the Wai rioi s are looking to
recover from poor showings in theii last matt lies, with
both teams coming off rough conference losses.
Stanford's serving and serve reception floundered
in a H-l loss to No. 7 Southern California on I ridav.
1 lie ('.ardinal picked up a season-high IS service er
roi sin the matt li and struggled with its passing in the
absence of l edshirt sophomore libero Setli Kni. who
continues to ret over from a shouldei injui v
"We re working to overcome the absence of King,
s.iitl head coach Ruben N ieves on Ihe team's prepara
tions foi Hawaii. "Without him in the lineup, we're
looking to be stronger on our serve-receive without
one of our best passers and strong on defense w iihout
one of our best diggers."
Despite the Cardinal's recent passing woes, the
Stanford attack is still sht >w ing the consistent \ ant I bal
ance that led the team to a blistering (>-() start to the
season. I he ('.ardinal is hitting a solid A52 on the sea
son and averaging 1b.7 kills per game, the second
highest mark in the conference.
Sophomore opposite ( art I oppel lias turned in
three consecutive 120-kill pcrlorniant es, and Ins teani
liigli 5.28 kills per game places linn second in the
MI'SF. |unior outside liittei Mart us Skatel is .ilso av
eraging over four kills per game, while senior middle
blocker Brett Youngberg is hitting a team-high

with 2.50 kills pei game.
" I la\ ing balance in out attack gives everyone a con
fidence boost.' said freshman libero |ohn Anderson.
"It allows us to woi k on the sniff that we need to work
tm in practice, like tun defense and sen ing."
Sen ing w ill pla\ a ke\ role in ibis weekend's matt li
