I.(>arie said.
In addition to Saturday's show
at the British Banker's C.lub, the
band has a tiumbei ot shows lined
up in the Bav Area, including sev

get their music to as nian\ people

"It's a tough thing," llav said,
"be< ause von want to be plaving all

ple to get sick of von."
Ainbcn Kelso recently returned
from a Southern C.alitornia tour
and will tour the state alongside
the I S. men's(Mvtnpic watet polo
team this summer.
I'lie changes in the band's
name, membership and sound
have not diminished its avicl tan
base, explained Stanford junior
and sclf-proc I.timed Amboy Kelso
groupie Ycsscla Stoy.mova. who

couldn't stop taving about the
band's music and new album.
"Sometimes their music has a
lot of energv. but it can also be
soothing,' Stovanova explained.
"(Theii music | lifts votn spini
when von listen to it."
Ainbcn K«-ls<» has turned its
music's wide appeal into a loval
and niulti-generational fan base-.
\ccording to the band, \inboy
Kelso's audiences include
teenagers and theii parents. How
ever, the majoritv of tans are t«>l
lege students.
Ainbov Kelso sa\s tliev hope
that the arrival of "Drive wins
them tans and helps them break
into more area (lubs. Although the
band previously released an
album recorded live at a series of
shows in IWJ (under the name
Stott I lax & (otnpanv), "Drive" is
the band's first studio recording.
Both Hay and Loarie empha
sized the contributions of sopho
more Scott Cannon, who pro
duced the protession.il quality
recording at the Knoll. In addition
to learning the- ins and outs of stu
dio recording, hand members
must also promote the new album
wit bout the help ot a manage!
"We end up spending almost 00
percent of our time on all the be
hind-the-scenes stuff — trving to
arrange gigs, learning to record in
a studio, making posters and stick
ers and putting them up all over
the place to get people to come to
our shows." Loarie said. "[But] it
doesn't take much to remcmbei
that it's all tor the music."
There have been some minor
moments of conflict as the hand
has adopted its new changes; the
band had a tough time agreeing to
the name. Other possibilities in
cluded "New California Railroad"
and "Rusted (lanvon."
Ambov Kelso will plav at 10:30
