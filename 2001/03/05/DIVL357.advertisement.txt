With a scratchy lick from her cat, Alicia awoke from
her dream."Ah. Chelsea," she sighed."lt was such a lovely
dream.You see, 1 owned a home!"
The cat not only smiled it's toothy grin but laughed v
out loud at the preposterous notion of home owner r
ship. But to Alicia, the vision had been so delightful, so
real that she did not want to give up the dream just yet.
"I wonder," she said, (which wasn't very original
since she was in Wonderland, after all) "I wonder if I will
ever be able to live in a home I own."
Suddenly, from behind her zip drive, a white rabbit I
raced toward her. After her initial fear of rabies was
abated, the rabbit explained:
"Alicia, oh Alicia, of course you can own a
home. Stanford Federal Credit Union has Zero Down
Mortgage Loans.They have low fees, low rates, and
possess expert knowledge on real estate matters in our local
Wonderland market."
Alicia twirled with joy. "Oh rabbit." she gushed,"My
dream CAN come true. How can 1 thank you?"
But when she looked around, the rabbit was gone.
"Where did he go,Chelsea?"Alicia asked her cat.
Chelsea only shrugged, grinned and gave a small belch.
"Silly kitty Alicia chided."Let's go find a home!"

Stanford Federal Credit Union
Dear Q&Q: I recently found a gold 55 coin dated 1883. At
least, I think that's what it is. It has a I/ like a Roman numeral
five on the reverse side. Is it rare and valuable?
Signed, Hopeful
Dear Hopeful: The coin you found is richer in history than
value. In 1883 the US Mint issued a new nickel with the head
of Liberty and a Roman "V" on the reverse. Since it didn't
say "cents " anywhere, a number of clever but unscrupulous
characters plated the coins in gold and carefully cut reeds into
the edges They then passed these off as five dollar coins
instead of five cent ones The coin is known to collectors as a
Racketeer Nickel.
The most famous case of altering and using these coins
involved a deaf mute named Josh Tatum. He would use the
coins to purchase 5C cigars. Proprietors of cigar stands would
assume the coin was a 55 gold piece and give Josh 54 95 in
change Although arrested. Josh was acquitted because he
never said the coin was worth 55. He couldn't speak! The Mint
began putting the word "cents " on the com the following year.
Enjoy your unique com but don 't plan on retiring from the
proceeds of its sale. I work at SFCU, so I know.
Orlando Salas, Courier, SFCU
Dear Q&Q: Why are there so many leaves and branches on the
Roosevelt dime? Was he a botanist, too?

Dear Botany Major: Actually they are symbolic. The torch, olive
branch and oak branch represent liberty, peace and strength
respectively. I work at SFCU, so I know.

m v
With a scratchy lick from her cat, Alicia awoke from
her dream."Ah. Chelsea," she sighed."lt was such a lovely
dream.You see, 1 owned a home!"
The cat not only smiled it's toothy grin but laughed v
out loud at the preposterous notion of home owner r
ship. But to Alicia, the vision had been so delightful, so
real that she did not want to give up the dream just yet.
"I wonder," she said, (which wasn't very original
since she was in Wonderland, after all) "I wonder if I will
ever be able to live in a home I own."
Suddenly, from behind her zip drive, a white rabbit I
raced toward her. After her initial fear of rabies was
abated, the rabbit explained:
"Alicia, oh Alicia, of course you can own a
home. Stanford Federal Credit Union has Zero Down
Mortgage Loans.They have low fees, low rates, and
possess expert knowledge on real estate matters in our local
Wonderland market."
Alicia twirled with joy. "Oh rabbit." she gushed,"My
dream CAN come true. How can 1 thank you?"
But when she looked around, the rabbit was gone.
"Where did he go,Chelsea?"Alicia asked her cat.
Chelsea only shrugged, grinned and gave a small belch.
"Silly kitty Alicia chided."Let's go find a home!"

Dear Q&Q: I recently found a gold 55 coin dated 1883. At
least, I think that's what it is. It has a I/ like a Roman numeral
five on the reverse side. Is it rare and valuable?
Signed, Hopeful
Dear Hopeful: The coin you found is richer in history than
value. In 1883 the US Mint issued a new nickel with the head
of Liberty and a Roman "V" on the reverse. Since it didn't
say "cents " anywhere, a number of clever but unscrupulous
characters plated the coins in gold and carefully cut reeds into
the edges They then passed these off as five dollar coins
instead of five cent ones The coin is known to collectors as a
Racketeer Nickel.
The most famous case of altering and using these coins
involved a deaf mute named Josh Tatum. He would use the
coins to purchase 5C cigars. Proprietors of cigar stands would
assume the coin was a 55 gold piece and give Josh 54 95 in
change Although arrested. Josh was acquitted because he
never said the coin was worth 55. He couldn't speak! The Mint
began putting the word "cents " on the com the following year.
Enjoy your unique com but don 't plan on retiring from the
proceeds of its sale. I work at SFCU, so I know.

Dear Q&Q: Why are there so many leaves and branches on the
Roosevelt dime? Was he a botanist, too?
Signed, A Botany Major
Dear Botany Major: Actually they are symbolic. The torch, olive
branch and oak branch represent liberty, peace and strength
respectively. I work at SFCU, so I know.
