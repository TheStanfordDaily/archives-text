1975
On March 5, 1975. The Daily printed an
editorial advocating more difficult grading
standards.
"In a preliminary vote, the C-AAA [Com
mittee on Academic Appraisal and Achieve
ment] recommended the reinstitution of
the 1) grade, but reversed subcommittee
proposals to restore an early drop deadline
and a recorded 'no credit' grade on student
transcripts.
"We support these recommendations.
We have already stated our opposition to
bringing back the no c redit mark and drop
deadline, noting that their reinstitution
would penalize students without reducing
grade inflation.
"The D grade would, however, reduce
the present grade point average of about
3.4 without penalizing students, lite 1)
grade would better relate the A. Hand (. to
their proper meanings.
"At present, the It grade stands lot no
more than average work in a course, while a
(1 is a minimum pass grade that main stu
dents are ashamed to see on their tran
scripts. If a I) grade were instituted, the B
would become evidence of good work,
while the (would become satisfactoi v."
Bottom line: Grade inflation is nothing new â€”
we have less now than we did 25 years ago.
