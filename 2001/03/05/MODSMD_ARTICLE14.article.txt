All of a sudden, Pauley Pavilion
isn't such a quiet f)laee.
According to a sound meter placed
court side, the decibel count reached
110 during Saturday's game with
Stanford. That's equivalent to a loud
rock concert or thunderclap. Even
some of the normally staid donors sit
ting in the lower level stood for part of
the game, a highly unusual sight.
For most of the game, the student
section was standing. Then again,
that couldn't have been as uncomfort
able as camping out in front of
Pauley, which about 100 students did
in the days before the game.
"UCIA is a tough place," Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said. "Peo
ple here are into basketball."
