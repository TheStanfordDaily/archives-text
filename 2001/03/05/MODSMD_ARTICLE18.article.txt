Students want inexpensive, eonvenient en
tertainment t»| »tit)tis — ;iiu 1 the new shuttle
serviee is one ol the best solutions, hv offering
a free serviee, the I niversitv makes the shuttle
accessible to .ill students and leaves them with
enough monev to afford the movie ticket. I lie
shuttle is also convenient — with half-hot n tle
p.n lure times and a central pickup location, the
serviie will continue to attract students who
want a night awav Irom the I arm.
I lie shuttles also helps to alleviate the alreatlv
horrendous parking situation at the AM( Met
t ado. We have seen students wait for ne.irlv ;'»()
minutes to park in spaces far from the the,iter.
I he shuttle helps students, both with and with
out tars, enjov the movies.
I he new video rental servit e, slated to debut
during the first week ol April, w ill also pi t v itle

much-needed entertainment options. I hose
students who want to spend I ridav night relax
ing in their rooms with a movie will no longer
have to coordinate trips to blockbuster to rent
videos. Students also avoid the hassle ol finding
someone to di ivelhein bat k to the video store lo
return their inov ies.
And, because the rental service is student
run, it is more likelv that the movie selection will
reflect the needs and wants of students.
I hough the I niversitv does have an obliga
tion to add to the student experience, one cam
pus organization seems conspi( uouslv missing
from the planning atitl sponsorship of these en
tertainment services. \\ hv hasn't the ASSI —
whit li has traditionallv been more involved in
issues ol student life — plaved a more central
role in improving the entertainment options lor
students? I he job of omelet ted student leaders
is to represent the interests and needs of stu
dents, and providing more choices for enter-

tainment certainh (alls under I his category
Last \ear, the ASSI OHice ol the President
worked in conjunction with the Dean ol Stu
dents OHice to develop Stanford Alter Mid
night, a program to keep I niversih services
open l.iter to meet student needs. While we re< -
ogni/e tli.it the ASSI has .1 somewhat dillerent
lik'us (his vear, the ASSI must still represent
student interests and goals through initiatives
for the student hod v. While the ASSI ovci sets
SSK, we wonder win our elected leaders
weren't working more directlx with the I niver
sit\ on these projects.
While thecurrent ASSI president, \ ice pres
ident and senators have just one quartet left, its
not too late for our representatives to address
some of the issues and concerns about student
life. 11l rough strong student representation,
the ASSI and the I niversitv can make already
entii ing entertainment options, and campus life
in general, even better.
