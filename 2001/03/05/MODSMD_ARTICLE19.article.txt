to constanth explore the ideas of new
technology and the news media. \s stu
dents at a major univcrsit\. we are the ones
who will have to discover not onl\ the new
tei hnologv .but also the methods of imple
mentation. It is no surprise that creating
this tei hnologv is greatlv valued, espccial
lv at a plat e like Stanford, but this I niv
sitv must also evaluate how to use that
tet hnologv to out advantage. We must
considei what uses might lead us in the
wrong direction, as well as those that lead
to an advancement in society.
I low ever, using the Internet to replace
a printed newspaper, for example, might
be detrimental in that it would create new
problems like portability and accessibility.
I sing the Internet to supplement a
printed newspaper — to entourage feed
back and a strong relationship between
the media and the communitv lor which it
serves — could be an incredible idea.
lhese davs. koppel talks about the
"world of new media." There are so main
diflerent directions it might go. Perhaps
it's to a fi>cus on the Internet. Perhaps it is
pit king voiu pet sonali/ed broadcast from
a menu anil receiving a ( D-ROM each
mot ning with your own version of new s.
Kither wax. the direction of new media
revolves around todav s students. And ei
tliei wav. it's going to be a matter ol trial
and error.
