As a result of hei hard work and personal

SAT exam gives 'less privileged
students a chance'
ro nsc to the editorial on Feb.
ei >a\ should considei new SAI I
), the use oi SA I I scores in the uni
t\ admission process h.is alwavs been
seen as one ot the most hated e\lis that hai
mam minoritv and lower-class students
tie <j ' into colleges. Phis conse
-0 nates the racial and class in
iju. . in t nc arena ot higher ediu at ion. It
is true th.it the test's role in the admission
process should he reconsidered, hut the use
ot SA I scores should not he eliminated.
t he SAT is preciselv what gives these
less privileged students a chance to show
that thev have the academic abilitv. .is well
as the perseverance and dedication for
higher education, which are some of the
most important qualities that m.itn uni
versities look tor in students.
flic college admission prcxess needs a
single unified s\ stem to measure students'
preparedness for the vigor ot universit\
academics because the applicants all have
such diverse academu backgrounds, be
cause not all students have the privilege of
attending high schools that offer a wide
spectrum of APclasses, it am at all. the stu
dents without these resources inevitablv
have transcripts that are less competitive
than those ot the prep-school students.
However, the SAI gives these students
a chance to prove themselves capable of
handling college-level work. A high SAI
verbal score can well demonstrate to an ad
mission officer that, even it a student has
not taken the AP Hnglish exam, he or she
still has the vcxabularv and skills to quic kK
and efficient]) comprehend a large num
ber of analytical essavs within a short

amount of time, which is preciselv what
students iniisi be able to do in order to do
well in c ollege.

and thus SAI si oresc an be used to demon

students.
1 know a freshman who could speak no
F.nglish when hei faniib tiist immigrated
to the I nited States seven vcars ago. \ei
thei ot liei parents are college-educated,
and she is the tiist college student in her
entire familv. Hei tathei works .it a gas sta
tion and hei faniib has to calculate how
much the\ spend on meat foi each meal;
thus, the S | .(>()()-S \ I prep course or work
books are siniplv out ot the question. Al
though this student did not have access to
mam AP classes while in high school, she
knew that s( oi ing liighh on the SA I could
give her a c bailee to get into a good school
like Stanford.
(onsequentlv. she took advantage of all
the resources available to her. such as bor
rowing SA I prep books from the tree pub
lit librarv and asking friends tor old copies
of the SA 1. She studied with all the materi
als she could find without paving a pennv.
As a result of hei hard work and personal
perseverance, this student was able to raise
iter SAI scores more than 100 points, ob
taining a score above I 100 without the help
of a prep-course. I bus, doing well on the
SAI is not .in aristocrat ic privilege or a racial
identitv; it is a demonstration of personal ef
fort and one's determination.
I he use of SA 1 scores should lx* contin
