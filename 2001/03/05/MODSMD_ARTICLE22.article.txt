SAN JOSK (AP) — Copyright music flowed
freelv on the Napster tune-swapping service vester
dav alternoon as millions of users waited to see if it
would fulfill a promise to block pirated songs begin
ning sometime this weekend.
A scan li of the company's servers showed all the
top 10 songs listed on the Billboard Hot 100 list were
available, including the No. I "Stutter" bv |oe fea
turing Mvstikal. Songs bv longtime Napster foe
Metallic.! also showed up in searches.
I lie company will not comment on the plan until
implementation is underway, said spokeswoman
Karen 1 KMarco.
As happened previously when Napster has been
threatened with i losure, usage was soaring. |list one
of dozens ol servers the site uses showed more than
I 1,100 people sliai a total of 2.2 million files ves
tcrdav afiei noon.
"I am kind ot watching it and trying to get mv last
efforts in — <|in< klv." said l lior Nelson, a user from
St. I'aul, Minn.
During a federal court hearing Friday. Napster
attoi ilev 1 )av id Boies said the sen u e would deploy
the si i eeiiing system ovei the weekend. He did not
prov ide a spec ifu time.
On iis Web site, Napster said the process of
s< i ceiling out file names, song titles and artists won't
be easy.
Ii has in involved a significant investment of
time and resources.' a statement said. "However,
we believe ii is supci 101 to shutting the set vice clown
and disbanding the rommunitv during I lie transi
tion period to I he new membership-based serv ice."
I lie software to be installed on Napster's servers
will bl» k k access to 1 million music files, Boies said.

He and other Napster officials did not s.iv whether
that number represented distinct songs or spelling
variations on a smaller list.
Napster's plan is a pre-emptive move against an
injunction sought In the major record labels, which
argue copyright holders and artists are not com
pensated for music traded on the service. Napster
lias argued that its computers do not store actual
song files but rather direct people to other users'
hard drives where the music can be downloaded.
In |nlv, I .S. District Judge Marilvn Hall Patel
granted the.- industn's request fen a preliminary in
junction and ordered Napster shut down for facili
tating infringement. But last month the 9th U.S.
(Ik nil ( a>iu tof Appeals staved the ordei pending
its dec ision in the case.
Bv Friday, all parties were back in court to discuss
the case when Napstci changed its tune and an
nounced plans to start bloc king songs.
1 lie change is significant, but the policv will work
onl\ if the company is diligent in policing its servers
and blinking workarounds such Madonna songs
where bet name is spelled with one "N," said Robert
Sc hwartx, an attorne\ who spec ializes in copyright
law.
I lilar\ Rosen, president of the Recording Indus
try Association of America, said the proposal is ,i
promising step.
"We think that ilie screening technology lias the
potential to be effective, but we'll see," she said after
Friday's hearing.
Yesterday, RIAA spokeswoman Ann Weiss said
the group would have not ommcnt linniediateK on
Napsur's implementation of file bloc king "or lack
thereof.'"
