high ot 11 points in the first eight
minutes ot plav. I nfortunatelv,
two earh touls forced the center to
take a seat, bin hei scoring sent a
strong message to the Cardinal
bench.
With Moos out of the game,
freshman Beckv Bonner carried
the team on hei shoulders, sinking
two 3-pointers and two inside shots
to clinch her season high of 10

points in the closing minutes of the
first halt. Bonner, who lias seen
limited minutes all season, showed
she was capable ot taking the floor
with the veterans.
"I thought Beckv Bonner came
in and gave us a huge spark. Yan-

However, while Stanford was
getting some big-time contribu
tions, I ClA's athleticism contin
ued to pose challenges to the Car
dinal game. I lie Bruins stayed
with the Cardinal point-tor-point
behind the strong plav ot junior

Michelle Creco and sophomore
Kristee Porter. With 9:50 remain
ing in the game, two tree throws In
Porter put the Bruins up b\ five.
The Brum run spurred the en
trance ot the third star performer
on the Cardinal front line, Kn
ghusen. I he junior came in, trans
tbrming the game with her strong
defensive presence and caretulh
calculated inside shooting.
UCLA, which doesn't have a
player over 0-toot-2, bail a hard
time with (i-7 Knghusen. A
er b\ junior Knjoli l/.idor and six
quick points tor Knghusen turned
a five-point deficit into a three
point ('.ardinal lead in a span ot less
than two minutes.
"[Knghusen] did a really good
job getting inside and posting up,"
VanDerveer said. "1 think she is ca
pable of doing this kind ot thing tor
us everv game. We have been wait
ing for it."
The Cardinal fed oft Kn
ghusen's intensity and v\as able to
run awax with the game in the tinal
five minutes.
In a true team effort, six players
were in double figures for Stan
lord. Moos had a team high of IS
points, while Knghusen, I/.idor,
and junior guards Lindsey Ya
masaki and Lauren St. Clair added
12. Bonner rounded out the dou
ble-figures with 10.
Leading I ( LA was conference
scoring leader Greco, who had 20
points in the contest. Porter
chipped in 10 for the Bruins.
One of the lasting memories of
the evening was the standing ova
tion honoring Dimson and Moos
as they exited the game together
with 23 seconds to play. In a sym
bolic changing ot the guard, the ef
k'Ct ot these two women on Stan
ford basketball was evident.
And while tliev hope to have
several more games to pla\. the last
game at Maples was.i monumen
tous occasion indeed.
"There have been a lot of great
memories here," said Moos. "What
means the most to me are my
teammates and my coaches. 1 think
everyone pulled through tonight,
and 1 am glad we could show the
tans we have heart."
