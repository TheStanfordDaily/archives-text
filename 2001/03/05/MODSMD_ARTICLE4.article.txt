LOS ANCKLKS — It time's

stein image ot Mike Montgomen,
veiling ill the rets from the sideline
,ind shoutinginstrm funis, all .is he
pliivs teacher to his collection of
i.ilented students.
So when the le.u liei gatliei s his
students togethei before the
biggest game of the season .is;.hum
NO. 12 1 CIA— the onh team to
beat the \o. 1 ('.ardinal thisveai
.uul tells them not to worn about
losing, it's got to be, well, .i little
shot king.
"Don't quote me on this, s.iid
sophomore guard Case\ |atob
sen."but lie's kind of uptight \\ hen
it's .i big game."
"It helped .i lot to h.ive him be
relaxed and sav to us,'(iuys, don't
worn, have fun, pla\ with confi
dence — if we don't get this one.
we're in a great position to get .in
other one. so pla\ vour hearts out
tonight."'
And his team did just that. De
spite a raucous crowd at Paule\
Pavilion and the pressure of plav
ing foi a I 'at -10 c hampionship,
Montgoinci N s team t amc
through with a huge Ha-7!) win
o\ei the bruins on Saturdav,

dine lung a share of the Pac-10 title

"Not t>nl\ were the\ the onl\
team that beat ns, but the\ were
the one te.mi standing in the wa\
of a No. I seed ami a I'.u - lOchani
pionship, Jiitobsen said. "If th.it
isn't enough motivation, 1 don't
know v\ hat is. And we responded."
Ihe emphasis in Jacobsen's
i emai k was <>ii the "we," and not
without reason, lour different
Cardinal players — |ason
Collins, |arron Collins. Rvan
Mendez and |atobsen — each
h.it 1 lit points to share the team
le.itl. I( IA had onh two pla\ers
in double -figures.
It is exat tlv that sort of team ef
fort that has defined Stanford's
season, and it was in evidence on
tiearh even trip down the floor.
I he same full-court pressure and
aggressive defense that gave the
Cardinal (27-1, 15-1 I'.u-10) fits
last month at Maples Pavilion was
handled with ease this time, with
even plavei helping to bring the
hall up the court.
I lie biggest difference on Sat
urdav, though, was on defense.
I lie bruins (20-7, 15-1) shot
ncarh 50 percent (7-of-15) from
.S-point range iu the fiist game,

looks at the basket ovei and over
again as \lontgonier\ groaned in
frustration.

Junior Jason Collins powers the ball into the basket in an earlier game
against Washington. Collins had 16 points in the Cardinal win.
"We just didn't locate those
guv s \cr\ well hist time," Mont
gomery said. "We were over-com
mitting to help, and they were
kicking out and hitting wide-open
shots."
So. for Saturday, the defensive
philosophy was switched up. In
stead of leav ing their man to dou
hle-team on the inside, the wing
plavers stayed on the outside
shooters, preventing dean shots at
the basket. I he strategy put more
pressure on the interior players to
stop their own man, but Mont
gotnei \ wasn't won ted about that.
"We left our post gu\s b\ them
selves. but the Collins twins have
been yen good .11 handling them
selves," s.iid Montgomery, who
was proven half-tight — I CIA
< enter Dan (>ad/urie w.is in con
st. mt foul trouble and stored onlv
eight points, but athletic power
forward Matt Barnes torched the
( at dinal for 32 points.

"Let Barnes have his night." |a
cobsen said. "It wasn't enough."
Sure enough, thanks to the
tighter defense, kapono and
Knight combined to shoot zero
for-six from the 3-point arc, while
combining for onlv 14 points, com
pared to 36 in the first game. As a
team, though, the Bruins shot .*>().7
percent from the field and lorced
14 Stanford turnovers, stats that
are usually good fora win.
"I don't think this was a situation
in which we plaved poorlv," said
I CL\ coach Stive l.avin. "Our
kids competed well. | But | Stanford
did a good job of pressuring the
ball and smothering our 3-point
shooters, and tliev were extremelv
sharp in all aspec is of the game."
1 he Bruins, to theii credit,
never surrendered, even after giv
ing up .111 I S-'J 1 mi in the middle of
the first half that turned a five
point lead into an 11-point deficit.
Led In the athletic Barnes, who
made life miserable foi both
Collins twins .iikl backup forward
I'cvoJohnson, I (LA made a I'J-'J
run of its own to pull within one be
fore ending the half (low 11 I.V 10.

I hc Bruins would never get
within four points of Stanford in
the second half, thanks in large
part to the (Cardinal sinking .ill 1 5
foul shots it took. Mende/. the se
nior forward and captain, sealed
the win down the stretc h In in.ik
ing eight in the last 1:10. i mining
his streak up to 1 1 con sec utive tree
throws in tie I odd l.ichti s sc hool
record.
"I le li.is ue in his veins." Jacob
sen said. "He carried us with his
free throws. He's a senior, and
that s what he does."
I here are still two games to go.
including .i difficult matchup
against Ari/ona, and demons to
exorcise in the NCAA Tourna
ment. For the moment, though,
the ( arclinal is content to savor the
taste of revenge and send .i little
message to the Dukes and Michi
gan Slates that await latei on.
"It's sweet. Mende/ said. "We
want to make ii a point that, when
teams see us around the couutrv.
the\ don't want to pla\ us in
Marc h."
W ithout a doubt, a lesson well
learned.
