it's .i big game."
"It helped .i lot to h.ive him be

And his team did just that. De

in double -figures.
It is exat tlv that sort of team ef
fort that has defined Stanford's
season, and it was in evidence on
tiearh even trip down the floor.
I he same full-court pressure and
aggressive defense that gave the
Cardinal (27-1, 15-1 I'.u-10) fits
last month at Maples Pavilion was
handled with ease this time, with
even plavei helping to bring the
hall up the court.
I lie biggest difference on Sat
urdav, though, was on defense.

again as \lontgonier\ groaned in
frustration.
