### GERALD MITCHELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A new proposal to combine six existing lan
guage depat tnu'iiis into otic lat get' department
lias produced mixed feelings among students.
t;i( ult\ and administration.
Malcolm Heaslev, (lean <»112 Humanities and
Sciences. receuth submitted .1 proposal to
Provost |< >1 m l\tc hemendv. staling "All facult\
and ac adcmi< staff How 011 the roster of the exist
ing departments [of Spanish and Portuguese,
1 renchand Italian, Asian 1 xinguages,Slavic Lm
guagc s. Russian and Ck t tnan Studies] will join
into .1 single department. I his department will

he (ailed I he Division ol Literatures. Cultures,
.ind 1 -manages.' "
I nder the new proposal, the existing depart
ments will he overseen b\ .1 single ( hail, rather
than the six separate ( hairs that currenth exist.
Instead, each "area group" will have a director
whii li will serve .is its representative on the I'oli
(\ Committee, who will serve .is .111 advisory
lio.ird to the chair.
I his proposed consolidation lias brought
(oinplaints from some students <11 id facult\. who
see this .is .111 administrative dec ision designed to
( lit costs.
" I'here is .111 undertone to this of being a bud
getan decision." s.iid Marisol Negron, a doctor

al student in Spanish and Portuguese.
Neuron continued l>\ saving that, at an insti
tution .is prestigious .is Stanford, the rationale
tot decisions such as tins should not be bud
getary, lit it should be based on an intellectual
agenda.
However, Beaslev. Keith Baker, the <og
nizant dean tor the humanities, and John Ben
der, professor of comparative literature, strong
l\ disagree with this assestnent of the proposed
change.
"The go.il of this [pro|w>sal] is to have a more
vigorous, exciting and interesting program."
said Hakei.

I hough lu s.iid th.it Stanford has

At c ording It) Jacqueline la/.u, a
gratluate student in Spanish and
Portuguese, ibis uncertainty over
allocations within the new depart
ment will likch lead to increased
competition between the different
language groups, asoppt>secl to the
interdisciplinary feeling that the
administration advocates.
Ik*asle\ contcntls, though, that
this flexibility will allow fora more

Furthermore, this untertaintv
will affect the quality of the pro
grams as well. Ncgron said. II a fat -

placed immediately, the qualits ol
the program will dec line, whit h w ill

Bcntlei agreed somewhat with
this assessment, but said that re

I think graduate students, es
pecially ... have reason 10 worn
(about replacing l.u 1 ill\ ]. but thc\
need to worrv either wa\hcntlci

Megron agreed that there is
rcm>lll for iinprovcmcni within the
existing departments. She said she
is siinpls not sure that litis propttsal
is the best wav to go about it. She
stated that giatluale students are
upset with the l.u 1 that though ibis
propt)sal was iu the prot cssol being
tlcvelopetl since |anuai v, there w as
no opportunity foi siudent input
until about a week ago. 1 hat does
not leave ninth time for meaning

dents to submit .1 comprehensive

coimter-pro|>osal.
"This proposal will cause the ex
isting departments to lose- much of
their autonomy," Negron said.
She also said that she feared
marginalization of different area
groups within the new combined
department. I his view was shared

"()ur concern is th.it we are not
like the other departments (in
volved in the proposed merger |. . .
We feai what the impact of being
evaluated l>\ huropcanists will he,"
Sun said.
Ac t < tiding to Sun, thei e is a feat
in the Asian Linguages Depart
ment tli.it, in coming together,
philisophical differences will arise
between the area groups and that
iliis could have .1 detrimental eficc t

However, Beaslev contends
thai, given the slrtu lure <>l the new
department .ind ilie fail that the
( hair will rotate everv few ve.irs
giving uliimale decision-making
powei to professors from different
area groups. Sun suggests that the
scenat it>. though p<issible, is higlilv
unlikely.
' 11 is in the interest of the( hair to

Beaslev said. In response tocriti

"We need to make it cleat thai

Beaslev continued saving that
