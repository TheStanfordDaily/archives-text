"We discovered that drug use ot

Stanford use by comparison
Illegal drug use at Stanford is
traditionally less than the national
average, saitl )im Nlontova, vice
provost it>r student affairs. "There
is a small percentage of the stuilent
population that uses drugs on a i eg
ular anil recurring basis. For iliis
portion of (lie stuilent hotly, I
would sav drug use is a problem. Fo
sav there is not a problem at Stan
ford would be untrue, but the ex

"I think , '(%m ; j students at Stan

there's definitely less amphetamine
abuse as far as other recreational
drugs go. You also don't see drugs

Stanford Police Chief Marvin
I lerrington offered anothei reason
for the discrepant v.
" I he drug situation here is not

greater number of serious drug-use
problems because there are more
part-time students w ho spend 11101e

Stanford are full-time.
Bet .insc ihei e is less di ug use at

" 1 here's a lot less peer pressure
here on campus than there was la

Drug use at Stanford
In "Stanford I niversitv's Drug
Subculture." one of over a do/en
student-produced video presenta
tions featured at the 2000 Stanford
Student Film Festival, seniors Flo
rence \<x.n and Nicoli Richardson
and juuiot Majda Muhictookaclos-
II look at the dvnamics ol student
drug use at the Farm.
"We discovered that drug use ot
all soils occurs at Stanford." Nocar
said. "It w;is surprising to heai w hat
could be found here, Irom pot toco
(aine, even reports ol heroin. Stan
lord students, from those we asked,
preferred F. and pot the best."
However, Peter, a recent Stan
tord graduate and occasional mari
juana sinokei. explained that many
students choose to use marijuana
o\et F.cstas\ because ol cost and
a\ailabilit\.
"Fc stas\ can go lor anvw here be
tween $'20 to $40 a hit." he said.
"You'd bettei have some serious
i.isli to keep up that habit.
In addition, mam students
think that using marijuana is less
clangei ous than harder drugs. But
studies have proven that marijua
na poses serious health risks,

Mans students said that thex
started using marijuana and then
moved on to other substances.
" I he first time 1 smoked pot was
in ni\ junioi vear ol high school,"
s.iul junior Brail, who uses other
cli ugs one to three times per week.
"A friend introduced me to it 011
New Year's Fve. I rareb smoked
pot 111 high sc I tool and didn't really
smoke a decent amount until
sophomore Near at college."
Rvan. who now uses hallucino
genic drugs like LSD several times

pa quarter, iilso stalled In smoking
marijuana in high school.
Stanford students buv marijua
na, F.cstasv and other drugs
through a system of mutatis.
"Most tlrugs like pot. ct Maine,
methamphetamine and F.cstasv
originate from an off-campus
source andareusuallv brought into
t anipus in hulk or semi-bulk quan
tities." saitl Brail, whose friends
often bin Kestasv.
Stanford use by comparison
Illegal drug use at Stanford is
traditionally less than the national
average, saitl )im Nlontova, vice
provost it>r student affairs. "There
is a small percentage of the stuilent
population that uses drugs on a i eg
ular anil recurring basis. For iliis
portion of (lie stuilent hotly, I
would sav drug use is a problem. Fo
sav there is not a problem at Stan
ford would be untrue, but the ex
tent of the problem is not wide
spread."
Sophomore 1 alia l'oal agreed
with Montova's assesnient.
"I think , '(%m ; j students at Stan
ford use aeatlemit'pcrtormaiu e-en
h;lilting drugs," she saitl. "And
there's definitely less amphetamine
abuse as far as other recreational
drugs go. You also don't see drugs
used here in the mainstream as
much as otliei schools."
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
I lerrington offered anothei reason
for the discrepant v.
" I he drug situation here is not
terribly bail," he saitl. "I think in a
lot of other institutions vou get a
greater number of serious drug-use
problems because there are more
part-time students w ho spend 11101e
time away from then respet tive in
stitutions, while most stiulents at
Stanford are full-time.
Bet .insc ihei e is less di ug use at
Stanford. there is less peer pressure
to use, 1 lerrington saitl.
" 1 here's a lot less peer pressure
here on campus than there was la
oi 'JO vears ago. when th ugs were
new," he said. "And people who are
into drugs usuallv hang together."
\«m .n's tltM ument.ir\ found this
to be true.
"l)i ug use seems to be more the
result of euriositv than peer pres

sure," Notai said. "There are drug
i irtles hut thev are not pressure
groups — more like support
groups."
Potential for disciplinary action

ment's regulation of student drug
use dot not usuallv int lutle arrest.
"W hat we tvpit all\ get are stu
tlents who call, don't give their
names and sa\ that drugs are Ix'itig
used in [a certain] dorm and that
thev don't appreciate it. I lerring
ton saitl. "So we go in through the
residential fellows anil the Stuilent
Affairs people and sa\. it the [indi
vidualsj using drugs are taught,
thev will not onlv have to deal witlij
Stanford's judicial svsteni. but also

Cowcll's role

Drug Abuse Program provides
drug counseling to students and
disseminates information through
education classes ami outreach to
stuilent residentes.
"< >iir educational outreach ef
forts reflect the fact that students'
patterns developed in high school
and college to handle stress, and
often continue well past the t ollcge- '
age vears," Montova said. "I want'
Stanford stiulents to learn how to
ileal with stress in healthy and pro
ductive ways."
"A lot of people use th ugs for es
capism." Rvan explained. "I'nless
vou assticiatc drugs with negative
things, win not use them? '
But .. . vou'll wake up one morn
ing and realize vou want to do
drugs in moderation, and you
yourself have to define exat tlv what
'moderation' means. Fo me, it
means living in reality without
being stoned. Because, in a very
real sense, vou are in an alternate
dimension when you take drugs."
