# Startling comment sparks thesis
## Senior recalls how student's single remark propelled examination of Nazi Germany history education 
### NICHOLAS CHAN STAFF WRITER 
Could one comment by a complete strangei
change your life? For senior Anna Sayn-
Wittgenstein, sue li a comment did.
It had onl\ been two weeks since Savn-
Wittgenstein, then a sophomore, transferred to
Stanford from the University of Edinburgh in
Scotland. As she sat down dining dinnei with
her new classmates, she introduced herself.
Upon hearing her German accent and recogniz-
ing her German last name, a Jewish student
turned to her.
"'You guvs killed tin family.' he said." re
called Sayn-W'ittgenstein."lt was completely out
of context."
Until this time. Sayn-Wittgenstein, who is halt
Swedish and halt ( >erman, said she was nevei af
fected by the stigma associated with Germans
and World War II. After this encounter. Sayn-
Wittgenstein began to examine het national
identit\ and everything assoe iated with n.
" 1 his statement led me to question how om
histon education and out consec]tient under
standing of histon shapes out identity," \i\n
Wittgenstein s.iid. " I Ins reflect ion iu return

sparked m\ interest in ni\ thesis project."
Sax 11-W'ittgenstein s thesis project stemmed
from her own ideas and interests, and has lasted
two vears. It examines how (•erman students
\ lew their national identitx. highlighting the dif
ferences between the views in last and West
(>erman\.
" I he point is that vou use pi imai \ sources
and establish something new. Sa\ n-W ittgen
stein said. "Nobodx has done this before. In
\our own little at ea of reseat cli, you're a com
plete pioneer."
I he first step towards her honors thesis
began when Savn-Wittgenstein applied with
I nclergraduate Research Opportunities fora
( happell-1 .ouggee grant during het sopho
more vear. 1 lie mone\ from tins grant allowed
her to trawl to (lertnanv.
1 here, she inten iewed high school students
to find out about then histon edtu ation, espe
cialh regarding World War 11. Hitler and the
I lurd Reii h, and examined how 11ii»echu ation
impacted students patriotism and national
identity.
At first, Savn-Wittgenstcin thought her re
scat ih in (>ei main would be the end of her in
\estigation of this issue-. But. aftei het junioi
vear. Sa\n-W'ittgenstein recei\cd a major grant
that allowed liei to travel back to (.erinanx to ex
pand liei l escare h.
During liei last trip. Savn-W'ittgenstein had
noticed that l-.ast I .e i man students answe red het
sin \e \ s elillcicntl\ from West (-ci man students.

revealing the ettects ot the dittering treatment
each haltot thecountn underwent (hiring(olll
- I his time, Savn-W ittgenstem lonised
hei attention on I'.ast Germain .
All together, she surveved mote than 100
students.
Now. Savn-Wittgenstein is compiling .ill liei
information into .1 tlnee-c hapier, 1(H)-page the
sis entitled "third Reich I list on t'.ducation 111
West .ind l-.ast (ieiman I ligh Si hools and In
fluence on National Identity.'
Sa\ 11-Wittgenstein savs her work on this the
sis has been difficult. Researching and writing
the thesis has consumed so ninth ot hei time
that she has had little chance to devote to othei
areas, including school work.
"Although 1 have it». Ijt Ist don't have the en
erg\ to divide up nn attention,"' she s.iid. "li s
something that's really monopoli/ing m\ mind
until M.i\. Writing .1 thesis is definitely also .1
slow. painful process at times."
Also, because Savn-Wittgenstein hasn't fin
ished writing \ft, she isn't entireh sure that she'll
complete her project at all.
"I'm trving to establish a causative relation
ship in inv research [between histon educ at ion
and political attitudes todav|. but I'm not w-t
sure whether I'll be able to pull it oil." she said.
Because the enormous time commitment
involved in writing the thesis. Savn-Wittgen
stein said she has often considered giv ing up.
