## Senior recalls how student's single remark propelled examination of Nazi Germany history education 
### NICHOLAS CHAN STAFF WRITER 
Could one comment by a complete strangei
change vonr life? For senior Anna Savn-
Wittgenstein, sue li a comment did.
It had onl\ been two weeks since Savn-
Wittgensteiti, then a sophomore, transferred to
Stanibrd from the I niversitx of Edinburgh in
Scotland. As she sat down dining dinnei with
her new classmates, she introduced herself.
I pon hearing her ('.ernian ac cent and recogni/-
ing her C.erman last name, a Jewish student
turned to her.
"'You guvs killed tin family.' he said." re
called Savn-W'ittgenstein."lt wascompleteh <>ui
of context."
I ntil this time. Sa\ n-W ittgenstein, who is halt
Swedish and halt ( >erman, said she was nevei af
fected bv the stigma associated with (iermans
and World War 11. Aftei this encounter. Sa\n-
Wittgenstein began to examine het national
identit\ and everything assoe iated with n.
" 1 his statement led me to question how om
histon education and out consec]tient under
standing of histon shapes out identity," \i\n
Wittgenstein s.iid. " I Ins reflect ion iu return

sparked m\ interest in ni\ thesis project."
Sax 11-W'ittgenstein s thesis project stemmed
from her own ideas and interests, and has lasted
two vears. It examines how (•erman students
\ lew their national identitx. highlighting the dif
ferences between the views in last and West
(>erman\.
" I he point is that vou use pi imai \ sources
and establish something new. Sa\ n-W ittgen
stein said. "Nobodx has done this before. In
\our own little at ea of reseat cli, you're a com
plete pioneer."
I he first step towards her honors thesis
began when Savn-Wittgenstein applied with
I nclergraduate Research Opportunities fora
( happell-1 .ouggee grant during het sopho
more vear. 1 lie mone\ from tins grant allowed
her to trawl to (lertnanv.
1 here, she inten iewed high school students
to find out about then histon edtu ation, espe
cialh regarding World War 11. Hitler and the
I lurd Reii h, and examined how 11ii»echu ation
impacted students patriotism and national
identity.
At first, Savn-Wittgenstcin thought her re
scat ih in (>ei main would be the end of her in
\estigation of this issue-. But. aftei het junioi
vear. Sa\n-W'ittgenstein recei\cd a major grant
that allowed liei to travel back to (.erinanx to ex

During liei last trip. Savn-W'ittgenstein had
noticed that l-.ast I .e i man students answe red het

All together, she surveved mote than 100
students.
Now. Savn-Wittgenstein is compiling .ill liei
information into .1 tlnee-c hapier, 1(H)-page the

West .ind l-.ast (ieiman I ligh Si hools and In

Sa\ 11-Wittgenstein savs her work on this the
sis has been difficult. Researching and writing
the thesis has consumed so ninth ot hei time
that she has had little chance to devote to othei
areas, including school work.
"Although 1 have it». Ijt Ist don't have the en

something that's really monopoli/ing m\ mind
until M.i\. Writing .1 thesis is definitely also .1
slow. painful process at times."
Also, because Savn-Wittgenstein hasn't fin

complete her project at all.
"I'm trving to establish a causative relation
