## The 						Stanford Daily Overseas programs need broader perspective 
### 
As rill- I)KADI-INK for narrowing
studv- abroad options draws near,
overseas programs are on the minds
<>l mam upperclassmen. Now is the
time lot students and the I niversity to think
about how to make overseas studv as ac c essible
.ind \ aluable as possible.
I<> start, the I niversitx should enable more
students to stud\ in non-traditional locations,
sue h .is (ihina. India or countries in Africa. Pro
grams in these areas are just .is valuable .is Stan
ford programs elsewhere, but they do not re
in ve much pi iblicitx and certain I niversit\ poli
c ics make them more dillic ult to attend.
I he number ol students who studv overseas
would grow tremendously il the I niversitv
made it more attractive — b\ increasing credit
transfers and financial aid — for students to
exploit* tlieii interests through a non-Staniord
program. And students who get the oppoiiu
nit\ to stud\ abroad, whether in a Stanford

program or not, should make every effort to
take advantage of their time awav, which ne
cessitates that tlu-v work to break out ol the uni
versity bubble and into the truer native experi

states that "Overseas Studies oilers Stanlord
undergraduates unparalleled opportunities to
studv and live abroad while c out inning normal
progress towards then degree. Students who
c hoose non-traditional programs should also
be afforded the same ease and leewa\ with
their academic work.
While the I niversitv is flexible about letting
students Mop out, some students who have
gone abroad with non-Staniord programs
even those who s.i\ tlu-\ planned well — find
that 11ic• \ have to take an extra quartet to make

While the I niversitv is flexible about letting

Ifa student wants to studv in a country with
out a Stanford campus, the onlv aid he or she
mav use is state and federal grants; I niversity
aid does not applv to these programs. Students

,nui meet new people. For the students leaving
next quarter, remember that it is certainly eas
ier and more comfortable to onlv speak to one s
English-speaking fellow Stanford students, hut
is it as worthwhile?
After all, if the point of studying abroad is
learning about other cultures, win limit one s
social experiences? Why continue to perpetu
ate the Stanford bubble? I he best time to ex
perience life abroad is now, while we are young
and have few family, work or other commit
ments. The chance to learn from people in for
eign countries and foreign countries them
selves is one that we likely won't have later, so
we should take advantage of it. Furthermore,
the I niversit\ should make every effort to give
students at least a quarter of learning and liv
ing awav from Stanford.
We .ill know that there's a world beyond
Stanford. Palo Alto and the United States —
win not take advantage of it?
