1 be conversation between us usualh goes

something like this:
You: Have vou met
John? I It's sitting on the
sot.i over there.
Me: No, I haven't.
Whit h one is he?
You: 1 he tall one.
Me: Ihev're all tall.
You: He's wearing a
blue shirt.

Me: I here aie a couple of guvs in blue
is.
You: Well, his is more ot .in aqua.
Me: You mean the Mack guy?
You: (stunnedsilnice)
Sure. John is Black, but vou weren't about
to mention it You were prepared to go into
mttv grittv details about the tvpe oft loth th.it
John's s<>( ks were made out of— anything to
.i\okl bringing rat e into the picture.
Note tii st that 1 choose to capitalize the
words "Mack" and "White" when used in
reference to rate. It is a convention 1 have
seen recenth in contemporarv ran- theory
and one which 1 will use in m\ columns
from this point on because I feel that
Mat k" and "White" are legitimate titles
that deserve to be capitalized, along with
Litmo," "Native American" and "Asian."
When 1 think about race, I lint! it both
imusing and curious that we have tlevel
oped ilus ostrich-like reflex to dealing with
it: We stu k our heads in the sand as t|uickl\
as we t an whenever rat e comes up.
In a way, I understand our dilemma.
We're reluctant to talk about rat e because
we feel we don't know anything about it. It's
,i scan topic. Deep down inside, we all know
that race is important, and we feai that sav
ing the wrong thing in a conversation can
leave lis with the awful, indelible stigma of
being a "racist." So. rather than talking
lbout it. we make a conscious effort to steer
rlear of discussions in which rate might
i ome up.
I here are two big flaws in this approat h.
I he first is that rat e isn't something that will
lis.jppear if we pretend that it doesn't exist.
Ihe second is that, while we've got our

heads buried in the sand, we're <>nl\ mak
ing oui dilemma worse. Sometimes we
don't talk about race because we can't lalk
about it in a knowledgeable wax. Hut b\
hiding from disc ussions about 1 ac e. we onlv
succeed in ensuring that oiu undet stand
ing of il ne\ei improves.
Do voii even know what rate is? How
about ethnic itv? Do \ou know what the dil
fcrence is between the two? Most people
don't — .ind the ieason I ha/.ird tli.it guess
is be< ause there isn't an\ real agreement on
the issue, even among s<k lologists and rat e
theorists.
1 lie wax l'\e come to differentiate be
tween race and ethnic itv is ibis: Race is
about color. Kthniciiv is about nationality
and c ulture. 1 have always been more con
cei ned with race than ethnic it\ because the
fbrinei is the \ isii.il cue we use to create cat
egoric al hall ieis between each otliei.
In one of nn previous columns, 1 uues
tioned w bethel Stanford students are ac tu
allv learning anything from the diverse stu
dent population around us. 1 still don't
think that we are. l'ei haps one of the obsta
cles to overcome in approaching di\ersit\
lies in leai ning how to deal wit 11 race.
I nfortunatelv. there isn't a c lass at Stan
ford called "Dealing With Race Race re
niains a mysterious, taboo subjec I that most
students won't mention in casual conveisa
tion. And. if it sta\s that wa\, soc l.il divisions
In race will continue to prevent us from un
derstanding each other. How can we con
c|iier that which divides us if we don't get
oui heads out of the sand and confront it?
1 love to talk about race. It fasc mates me.
I'm even majoring in it. I've learned a lot
about race, and 1 want to share some of
what I've learned with all of you.
In the weeks to come, I'm going to w i ite
about issues involving race. I'd like even
one who reads this column to get a bettei
understanding of race and the role it plays
in oui lives, not onlv here at Stanford, but
everywhere else in the world. I want von to
be able to deal with race in a wa\ that vou
might never have before: honestly,
thoughtfully and serioush.
Hut I don't w ant you to take am thing
that I write here as absolute truth; I wel
come your disagreement. Write back and

up with reasons wliv I'm wrong than have

1 be conversation between us usualh goes

something like this:
You: Have vou met
John? I It's sitting on the
sot.i over there.
Me: No, I haven't.
Whit h one is he?
You: 1 he tall one.
Me: Ihev're all tall.
You: He's wearing a
blue shirt.

Me: I here aie a couple of guvs in blue
is.
You: Well, his is more ot .in aqua.
Me: You mean the Mack guy?
You: (stunnedsilnice)
Sure. John is Black, but vou weren't about
to mention it You were prepared to go into
mttv grittv details about the tvpe oft loth th.it
John's s<>( ks were made out of— anything to
.i\okl bringing rat e into the picture.
Note tii st that 1 choose to capitalize the
words "Mack" and "White" when used in
reference to rate. It is a convention 1 have
seen recenth in contemporarv ran- theory
and one which 1 will use in m\ columns
from this point on because I feel that
Mat k" and "White" are legitimate titles
that deserve to be capitalized, along with
Litmo," "Native American" and "Asian."
When 1 think about race, I lint! it both
imusing and curious that we have tlevel
oped ilus ostrich-like reflex to dealing with
it: We stu k our heads in the sand as t|uickl\
as we t an whenever rat e comes up.
In a way, I understand our dilemma.
We're reluctant to talk about rat e because
we feel we don't know anything about it. It's
,i scan topic. Deep down inside, we all know
that race is important, and we feai that sav
ing the wrong thing in a conversation can
leave lis with the awful, indelible stigma of
being a "racist." So. rather than talking
lbout it. we make a conscious effort to steer
rlear of discussions in which rate might
i ome up.
I here are two big flaws in this approat h.
I he first is that rat e isn't something that will
lis.jppear if we pretend that it doesn't exist.
Ihe second is that, while we've got our

heads buried in the sand, we're <>nl\ mak
ing oui dilemma worse. Sometimes we
don't talk about race because we can't lalk
about it in a knowledgeable wax. Hut b\
hiding from disc ussions about 1 ac e. we onlv
succeed in ensuring that oiu undet stand

Do voii even know what rate is? How
about ethnic itv? Do \ou know what the dil
fcrence is between the two? Most people
don't — .ind the ieason I ha/.ird tli.it guess

the issue, even among s<k lologists and rat e

1 lie wax l'\e come to differentiate be

1 love to talk about race. It fasc mates me.

about race, and 1 want to share some of
what I've learned with all of you.
In the weeks to come, I'm going to w i ite
