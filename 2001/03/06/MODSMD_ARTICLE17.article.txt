Athlete urges consideration of
another side of Nike controversy
As one person, I < ci i.miK i aiinol speak
lot .ill student-athletes, bin 1 |iisi want to
verl).ili/e .inothei side of the issue. Nike is
detiniteh embroiled in controvers\ now.
.md Stanford's ties to sueli .1 corporation
.ire question.ihle .it hest. 1 am not certain
how I leel about the whole issue, but, as a
student-athlete, I have a unique perspec
tive on the issue that non-varsit\ athletes
|ust do not have.
I run tr.u k tot the ( aicliiial, and 1 put
in at least 20 to HO hours eat h week, in all
kinds ot weather, through team woi kouts
and runs on tn\ own. (iood equipment is
an invaluable part ot m\ training, espe
(i.ilh in the form ot shoes.
Without propel shoes—which must
he not onl\ comfortable but also durable
and protective — runners like me can
quu klv develop injuries that (an interrupt
and even threaten their c.u eel s. Because I
put in so manv miles, 1 wear out shoes
quickh and.v ithout having them subsi
dized. track could become a ver\ expen
sive proposition that I don't need on top
ot the rising tuition.
\ikc makes the best shoes — plain and
simple. I hey have alwavs been at or near
the top in all sports equipment, and Stan
ford's current deal allows student-ath
letes to £et qualit\ equipment to use dur
ing their seasons at little or no cost to
them.
rhe sweatshop issue does bother me
quite a bit, but the Nike deal benefits
other student-athletes and me immense
ly — almost to the point where we are de

pendent on it. Does it bother me to be a
"running billboard" tor Nike? Not
realh — vou usualh do not think about
those sorts ot things in the middle ot an
NOO-meter race, besides, because of
N'l'.AA regulations, the "Swoosh" on our
uniforms and equipment is so small that
it is bareh not it cable.
I .1111 not justitving Nike's policies or
Stanford's deal with Nike, hut I do want to
hi ing to light another side ot the argu
ment that 1 feel main forget in their cru
sades tor social justice. One must always
consider all sides ot an issue and .ill peo
ple who will be affected In big policy
i lunges. In students' mission to set things
i ight. please do no forget the student-ath

ASSU members should be prepared
'to hold themselves accountable'
List I'llursdav. the ASSI s attempt at a
great idea for bringing students together
backfired as a result of disorganization
and incompetence. I think the idea of a
large screen and free food to entice stu
dents to come together and support Stan
ford Athletics is a superb idea.
As an avid supporter of Stanford bas
ketball. 1 made sure 1 arrived with enough
time to reserve a good seat, but 1 was thor
oughly disappointed at the lack of organi
zation in setting tip the event.

Five minutes before game time, the
projector screen was still King on the
floor and no one showed a sign of begin
ning to set it up. Apparently, only bv half
time was the game finally shown. After
watching the game at Arrillaga instead, I
returned to grab some free pizza, at the
ver\ least. That became a competition in
itself, though, .is there was no organized
method of distribution. Some people
fought and were able to have several
slices tor themselves. I he\ also brought
pi/za back to their friends, who did not
even wait in line, while mam people did
not have a chance for any pi//a at all.
As I remember, many of this vear's
ASSI representatives are part of the Plat
form tor Accountability and C hange. 1 ex
pect that the ASSI members are prepared
to hold themselves accountable to the
Stanford student body. Iliev have suc
ceeded in wasting our mone\ and time
through their incompetence.
Specifically, because Mike Osotskv at
tached his name to the e-mail, 1 would ex
pect that he is especially prepared to ex
plain the debacle that took place. I hope
that this was not the last time such a night
is planned, as 1 do believe that such ac tivi
ties contribute significantly to Stanford's
student lite.
However, if Mike Osotskv and the
ASSt do not have the ability to plan ap
propriately tor such an event, thev should
at least give us the money they would oth
erwise waste so that we could buy the pizza
ourselves.

simple. I hey have alwavs been at or near
the top in all sports equipment, and Stan
ford's current deal allows student-ath
letes to £et qualit\ equipment to use dur
ing their seasons at little or no cost to
them.
rhe sweatshop issue does bother me
quite a bit, but the Nike deal benefits
other student-athletes and me immense
ly — almost to the point where we are de

pendent on it. Does it bother me to be a
"running billboard" tor Nike? Not
realh — vou usualh do not think about
those sorts ot things in the middle ot an
NOO-meter race, besides, because of
N'l'.AA regulations, the "Swoosh" on our
uniforms and equipment is so small that
it is bareh not it cable.
I .1111 not justitving Nike's policies or
Stanford's deal with Nike, hut I do want to
hi ing to light another side ot the argu
ment that 1 feel main forget in their cru
sades tor social justice. One must always
consider all sides ot an issue and .ill peo
ple who will be affected In big policy
i lunges. In students' mission to set things
i ight. please do no forget the student-ath
letes who woik .md compete to their best
abilit\ to add to the I Hivei sit\'s accolades
and prestige.

ASSU members should be prepared
'to hold themselves accountable'
List I'llursdav. the ASSI s attempt at a
great idea for bringing students together
backfired as a result of disorganization
and incompetence. I think the idea of a
large screen and free food to entice stu
dents to come together and support Stan
ford Athletics is a superb idea.
As an avid supporter of Stanford bas
ketball. 1 made sure 1 arrived with enough
time to reserve a good seat, but 1 was thor
oughly disappointed at the lack of organi
zation in setting tip the event.

Five minutes before game time, the
projector screen was still King on the
floor and no one showed a sign of begin
ning to set it up. Apparently, only bv half
time was the game finally shown. After
watching the game at Arrillaga instead, I
returned to grab some free pizza, at the
ver\ least. That became a competition in
itself, though, .is there was no organized
method of distribution. Some people
fought and were able to have several
slices tor themselves. I he\ also brought
pi/za back to their friends, who did not
even wait in line, while mam people did
not have a chance for any pi//a at all.
As I remember, many of this vear's
ASSI representatives are part of the Plat
form tor Accountability and C hange. 1 ex
pect that the ASSI members are prepared
to hold themselves accountable to the
Stanford student body. Iliev have suc
ceeded in wasting our mone\ and time
through their incompetence.
Specifically, because Mike Osotskv at
tached his name to the e-mail, 1 would ex
pect that he is especially prepared to ex
plain the debacle that took place. I hope
that this was not the last time such a night
is planned, as 1 do believe that such ac tivi
ties contribute significantly to Stanford's
student lite.
However, if Mike Osotskv and the
ASSt do not have the ability to plan ap
propriately tor such an event, thev should
at least give us the money they would oth
erwise waste so that we could buy the pizza
ourselves.
