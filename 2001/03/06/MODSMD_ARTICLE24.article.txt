Sure, the\ 're just ,is important .is the sm
iles man lies in determining dual meet
winners, hut thev alwavs seem to take a
hat k seat to those one-on-one duels that get
all the attention.
At the I I lit 11 annual Pacific (oast Dou
bles Championship, though, it's all about
the doubles. And, so far this vear, the No. 2
Cardinal (8-1, 2-0 I'acifit 10 Conference)
has been fortunate in ha\ing perfbrmanc es
from its doubles teams.
In a low- to no-pressure situation, three
of Stanford's doubles pairs hoped to get a
read on theii pla\ when thev traveled south
to La |olla over the weekend to plav in the
private!) sponsored tournament.
Although none of the three teams were
able to take home the tropin, all three
had impressive moments throughout the
tournament.
"We had a good tournament, but not a
great one," associate head coach |ohn
Whitlinger said. "N<ottv (Scott) and Ali
(Ansari) did a nice job. Thev had a very

gootl win over I CLVsNo.I doubles team,
(Jean-Noel) Crinda and (Jean-Julien)
Rojer."
Sophomore Carter Morris, who played
with fellow sophomore Rvan llaviland in
the tournament, echoed Whitlinger's
thoughts.
"Everyone plaved well, but no one
plaved great," Mori is said. "1 think Ali and
Scott\ had the best energv of any of our
teams."
Scott ami Ansari, both seniors and tri
captains, made it further than anv Cardi
nal pair in the tournament, reaching the
semifinals before falling tt> Martin
Matkowski and Travis Rettenmaier of
UCIA, 7-0. (i-M.

and Scott — No. 18 in the nation and the
fifth seetl in the tournament — pulled tiff
the upset in the quarterfinals against No.
2 seed and seventh-ranked Crinda/
Rojer, 7-f), 6-4.
"I tee I like we had a good tournament
down in La Jolla," Ansari said. "Ideallv,
[Scott and I] would have liketl to pull out
the last match against [Matkowski Retten
maier], but overall it was a step in the right
direction."
Scott and Ansari, w ho have not partici
pated in main dual meets for the Cardinal
because of Scott's elbow injury and a bout
with the flu, had won 12 matches in a row
