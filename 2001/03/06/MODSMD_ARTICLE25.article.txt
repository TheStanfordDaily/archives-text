tight throughout the match, and the two
squads need overtime to produce an out

the overtime |xri< kls. the (.ardinal edges out
the Trojans to take the victon. I bis match
was the closest that the undefeated ( ardinal
had come to losing all season.
I he first half of Friday's match unfold
ed in a fashion similar to the squads prior
meeting, and the match was deadlocked
entering the third quarter.
The scoring started immediately, and
I S(. was first to strike as it came out to take
the lead less than a minute into play. I he
Cardinal responded quicklv and evened
the score with a goal b\ senioi Kris Koblick.

"We did not pla\ even close to our best
the first half," said head coach John Tan

were due to our lapses. However, .is a
team, we plavetl really good individual de
fense that treated a lot of good opportuni
ties on our earlv offense. We also did a re
all\ good job of t omtnunit ating as a team,
and our help defense was great."
(oming out of the locker room, the Car
dinal exploded for seven goals in the sec

the night. While the Cardinal came up big
with seven goals, the Trojans could onlv
answer with three. Once again, Stanford
had defeated one of its biggest conference
competitors to remain undefeated and
maintain its No. I ranking.
"I don't think that they shot the ball .is
well as tliev did the last time we played
them. Fanner said of I SC. "YVe also did a
better job of moving their main setter out
of the heart of their offense, which made
her much less efficient and really slowed
their overall offense."
