# Yankee spending spree buys championships

I'm beginning lo get disgusted with ilu*
\cw York '.ii 1 kct's thcii cash-laden
owner. (.eoi ge Steinbi ennei has been
ha 11(1 i11<4 out ridiculous mullimillion-dol
lai »onli.u ts fask'i ill.m .i (h 1114 dcalci handsout
mari|ii.ma .n a I'liish concert. I his reckless
spending with no regard loi l.m competition is
sl< >w l\ hut surclx luining the name of hasehall.
\o\\ some people ma\ s.i\ that the lac I that 1
w.is In>i u and raised in Arlington, I e\.is, home
ol Ihe I c\as Rangei s (who have heen 4>ounc eel
Irom the plaxoflshv the damn N ankees in twool
the last three seasons), should preclude me
trashing the Yankees. \nd. given the lad that
ilu Rangei s iccent spending spice on siuli
high profile tree agents as \le\ Rodriguez and
\ndies (Galarraga makes .i sororitx girl with
tl.idch s (iedit card seem lisiallx responsible,
111.11 point iiia\ he valid. Bin I'd he less of a man
11 I let tacts get in the wax of expressing a decp
scatcc' | u 'i s<>ual I >ias.
I lie \ ankees hahit ol hux ingc hampionships
has laken most ol the e\i itenient out ot the
ganicol hasehall (the icsi was taken axxax In the
lad that baseball reallx lsu'i all that exciting to
begin with) \nd this veai promises to be mote
ol the same, with the ankees handing out SBB
million to Mike Mussina. With this txpe ol
spending, Steinbrennei doesn't belong in pro-

lesMonal baseball, lie belong?
in a |ax / x ideo.
I en ot the 30 Majoi
I eague baseball train hise>
luxe pax rolls that are less
ill.in one iliud that ol the
Yankees. And it almost seem?
a l<x k that the paxre>ll of tlu
Minnesota I x\ ins xx ill he les>
than what the Yankees will

pax Derek |eter. (And hox\ can anxone like a
gux who makes more than an entire team and
went out will) Mariah ( aiex r)
\nil I'm su k ol |oe l one winning KSP'S
awards l(»i Managei ol the Year. I xerxone al
waxs praises him loi oxerconiingcancel and siill
leading his team to the World Championship.
I lie gux has (ash Moating around him like he
was Scrooge Mi Dm k swimming in Ins monex
hin. I le could have been struck simultaneously
with explosixe diarihea, elephantitis and the
Khola virus and still liaxe xvon the World Series.
I ft his trend of I'lill Daddx-esque spending is
going to continue unchcked, pel haps the an
kees should trx xenturing bexond baseball to
find a xvorthx opponent. I he Yanks should trx
theii hand against an equallx overpriced, xet
liighlx siu (essful flit it x.
So how about this foi a real clash of the I i

tails: the \cw York Yankees vs. I lit* Stanibrd
1 < 11u .uit>n Hie Yankees and thcil 11i11U inflat
ed pa\ roll could match talents against Stanford
and its liighh inflated grading scale. Couldn't
vou |usi pic ture the classic pitc her s duel be
tween the Rocket, Roger Clemens, and the
Prison l.xperiment. /imbarclo's l*s\c li I class.
C )i maybe a hottom-of-the-ninth standoff with
Mariano Rivera scjuaring off against
Kate hadourian's human sexualitx curriculum
(neithei one is going to gel anyone past liist
base).
Sadh . this is the onK wax that we're going to
sc-e s( tme real competition in baseball as long as
Steinbienner remains pimp supreme of the
baseball universe. Even though I'm generally
against making stereotN pic al statements ab«>ut a
large group of people, I have no qualms about
saving that New Vol kers should slick to I lie
things the\ know — pi//a pies, contract killings
and hating |ohn Roc ker — and leave baseball to
the places where people still believe in financial
ec|iiit\. fair pla\ and good, old-fashioned base
ball. I ike- I exas.
And it you disagree with anything I've just
said, vou're just terribh wrong.
