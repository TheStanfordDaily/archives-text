### BENJAMIN FRIEDLAND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Foi the past tout weeks, the lamili.u smell ot
steaming lattes and chocolate croissants have
been blending with the exotic sounds ot foreign
languages. ()u Feb. 12,Pigoit I l.ill, wluc It hous
es the I )ivision of I .iterature, (iultures and Lan
guages, welcomed the coffee community as
Mooubc ans opened its new cafe in response to
requests from fac ultx and students.
I he sec ond-tlooi coffee shop, open from S
a.m. to I p.m.. Monda\ through l'hursdav, and

H a.m. to p.m. on Fridavs, is currently in a trial
period; on |une 4, Moonbeans will decide
whethei <»t not to continue the operation.
"In |line, if we're making profits and the
I niversiiv is happy, we'll keep it," said manag
er Sarah }ones.
I he new c ate uses a portable coffee cart th.it
is now self-contained, explained Moonbeans
etnplovee Howard kui/lv. "But we still serve
evervthing that the other Moonbeans serves,
except for the freezes."
I he plans fora coffee place at Pigott Hall
date back to last fall, when students and faculty
requested a coffee shop "to improve and ex
tend intellectual exchange in the Division [of
Literature, Cultures, and Languages]," said
|ohn Bender, chair ot the Department of Lan
guages and (lompaiative Literature.
Although business started slow, employees

have remained positive and hopeful.
"We were a little nervous the first week," said
kut/lv, who lnis worked in coffee shops for the
past 16 vears. "But it takes time, and we've
tripled our business in these last few weeks.
After all, this is the best coffee on campus."
Jones said she hopes that the location mate li
es customers needs.
"If it's convenient tor faculty and students
with their packed schedules, it would be really
great," she said. "If you're in the Quad, 1 think
it would make sense."
Many have reacted positively to the new
Moonbeam.
"It's nice to have the lounge actually look like
a lounge," said Spanish Prof. Joan Molitoris.
"The distribution of chairs and a coffee bar are
ver\ conducive to .1 hangout plait*
lor even one in tlie* building."
Sophomore ( In is Van Dvke is
excited about I'igott Hall's addi
tion. 1 have about halt in\ classes
in building L'tiO." he said. "And I
love (otlee."
While I unc hand Italian I'rot'.
Robert H.irrison said lie thinks the
new coffee shop is "great and
should be supported." he did have
one suggestion.
Make it a sni» >king cate." he
said. Aou cannot have a serious
exchange ot ideas in .1 smoke-free
environment. Coffee. cigarettes
and discourse go together. Stan
ford needs at least one place w here
lac 1 lit\ and students can get to
gether 111.1 discin sive atmosphere.
It vou take cigarettes awa\. vou're
jnst left with a lounge."
H.irrison also said that "their
espresso is good, w 11 u li is essential.
Business would increase if tliev
were to get good soups and keep
up wit 11 the sandw ic lies."
Despite extensive praise, the
new Moonbeans lias also suffered
some 11 itii ism from students.
"Last quarter, 1 had a class

there, and. at least a couple times a
week. m\ professor would leave to
go get coffee for about 15 min
utes. said sophomore Matt Stein
burg. "So I'm kind ot glad it wasn't
there last quarter."
However, the cafe's presence
has benefited mam students and
facultv. according to Harrison.
After comparing life in the pre-
Moonbeans I'igott 11 all with post-
Moonbeaus life. Harrison admit
ted that students have been
slightl\ perkier latelv. Uiaslia
Mm hell, a cotc rininal student in
Latin American Studies, attests to
this.
"1 have a 9 a.m. 111 I'igott Hall
evervdav." she said "I used to nod
off regularlv. Now I can hatclh sit
still."
Working in 1 lie- language build
ing for the past four weeks has
even benefited the cafe's emplov
ees. kui/l\ said that his Spanish is
slowlx coming back, and that lie
lias even committed to learning a
little Arabic.
I'igott Hall's culture lias inllii
enced Moonbeans as well, kut/\
said.
Moonbeans has scheduled its
official gtand opening for Mon
dav, March IL\ and will serve SI
drinks between 11 a.m. and 12
p.m. and 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.
