# Grad student makes E. coli breakthrough
## 
### BILL BOWEN STAFF WRITER 
Production of penicillin alternative erv
thronivcin has just become quicker and
cheaper, thanks to the work ol Blaine
I'feifer, a doctoral student in the Chemical
Engineeering Department. Pfeifer s re
search was published in an article in the
March 2 issue of Sc ienc e Maga/ine.
I'feifer, who is working in the lab of Pro
fessor Chaitan Khosla, was able to geneti
callv engineer Kschericliia coli bacteria to
mass produce the antibiotic by replacing E.
coli genes with genetic material from othei
bacteri.i. IMeifer was assisted b\ postdoctor
al researcher Su/anne Admiraal.
Krvthromvcin is naturallv produced bv
soil bacteria. Saicharopolyspora ervthraea.
to inhibit tiearbx bacteria strains that ma\
compete for resources. I lit- process lac ks
speed because the S. ervthraea populations
grow slowl\. onl\ doubling even - four hours.
Bv contrast, K. coli populations can double in
just 20 minutes.
IMeifer s work is not onlv useful in mass
production of erythromycin, but it also
makes it easier to mcxlifv the drug to combat
resistant bacteria strains, in contrast to chem
ical manipulation, which can be more diffi
cult and costly.
Khosla and colleagues began investigating
the possibilitvof genetic manipulation to pro
duce ervthromycin 10 years ago.
"We've had .i long-standing interest in the
biosynthesis and pharmacology of natural
products," Khosla explained. "An essential
tool for bios\ nthetic engineering of natural
products is the development of a simple s\s
tem like K. coli that can make a natural prod
uct of interest. If one can do this, then one can
manipulate the system further bv genetic and
chemical approaches."

1 he success of the experiment came .is .i
sin prise to IM'eifer and his colleagues, who
were not even sure at the outset that the
foreign genes that replaced the four E. ( "oli
genes could be expressed b\ the bacteria.
"This research showed me the flexibility
and ama/ing potential a simple bacterium
like K. coli possesses, IMeifer said.
"E. coli is realh our friend," Khosla said.
"It can do things that even experts thought
would be hard for it to do."
IMcifer and Khosla are optimistic that this
discovers will have applications beyond the
production of erythromycin.
"We'reex< ited about not onl\ the- produc -
tion of ervthromvein, but the potential pro
duction of many other natural products
using this new system." lMeifei explained.
" I his w as just a model system for us to focus
on. We're hoping to exti apolate the i esulls to
other therapeutic s as well."
IMeifer hopes this will lead to new
opportunities for research in genetic
engineering.
" I his is not such a great feat in genetic
engineei ing, but it's a step towards a com
pleted new wa\ of thinking about making
a natural product." IMeifer s.iid. I think
this will tempt people into trying new re
search th.it before would have been hard to
sell."
Khosla said he agrees, noting that it was.i
similar breakthrough in genetic engineering
that led to efficient mass production of in
sulin.
"Although people had recognized the
therapeutic value of insulin l>\ I'.WO, it was
only after the development of genetic engi
neering in E. coli could insulin be mass pro
duced cheaply, and could people contem
plate the possibility of developing superior
versions of insulin. Khosla said. "I he same
goes for antibiotics sue h as erythromycin."
