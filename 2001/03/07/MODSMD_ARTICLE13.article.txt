There are a number of practical precautions we
can take everv day. We must rememlxT to lock
front and room doors because manv of the bur
glaries perpetrated on campus occur without
toned entry. 1 .ockcd doors, like extra street lights,
easily and eflectivelv deter most would-be Innglars.
Staff in dormitories and houses must stress to theii
residents the importance ol dosing I rout doors,
rather than leaving them propped < >peu for guests.
We must also considei activeh patrolling out
campus. More often than not, buiglaries could have
Ix'en prevented with a simple phone call to the po-

lid* department or In notifying other memlx'is ol
the house about an intruder. II you do not know a
person who is loitering around your house, alert the
residence stall! Hie extra eflbrt may pay oil.
Students should also he more aware of their
surroundings. If you run at night, go with some
one else. If you can't find anyone to go with, con
sider working out at 'Iresidder Fitness ('.enter or
Arrillaga. Both facilities are open until 2 a.m. If
you Have a late class or section, tell your roommate
or a friend w hen you expect to return.
These suggestions should Ik- part of every
one's daily routine, and we all have .1 responsibil

plat e. I he crime rate at Stanford is low and the
campus is, generally speaking, verv safe. We are
very luck\ in (his respect. I lowever, we should still

ty. Periodic incidents, such as burglaries, should
remind students and I diversity administrators
to re-evaluate their roles in campus security.

buiglarv circulate at Stanford, awaken-
1 1 u-(atnpus from its hiliernation lor a
tunc. Now, at the end of tlie quarter,
when students are preparing to move into or out
of residences, issues of campus safet\ once again
come to the fore. The responsibilit\ for sm li inci
dents, meted out almost aunuallv, is ( h,liked upei

Stanford maintains one <>l the most open and
salt' campuses in the country. I lie campus envi
ronnient has allowed Stanford to remain tree of
door ke\ cards. dorm securit\ guards and other
measures currenth employed on main other
campuses. We are justifiahh proud of our safe
campus, hut both students and the I diversity
must take action to keep out surroundings free of
the potential for i time .

Ihe I niversitv. in conjunction with the Stan
lord Police, has implemented safety measures that
have made campus safer over the past few years.
We commend the I niversitv for its eflorts. I he
hlue emergeiKA lights are useful. Stanford's
M RK Kst < >rt Sen ii e. the late-night ride serv ice, is
anothei neccssan campus fixture.
hut s.iletv problems remain. Ihe hlue lights
have limited coverage, especiidlv in less-populat
ed areas <>112 < anipus. The street lighting in certain
areas — sin h as stret< lies of ('.anipus I)rive and
fai west ( anipus — is inadequate. I his problem is
easih fixed, and reinedving it would result in in
creased security in poorlv lit areas.
In addition, there should also Ik- greater set u
rit\ around (.owell Cluster. Located on the pe
riphery of (atnpus, the area is hometolaige num
bers ol women living in the three sororit\ houses.
I he situation < reates an especially attractive envi
ronment for criminals, so the I niversitv should
pa\ special attention to ( owell (.luster.

As students, mam <>( us aunt* to Stanford and
experience greater freedom than we have ever
had before. Trapped in the proverbial Stanford
bubble, we sometimes (< >tget that we live in an area
with potential problems and dangers, because the
area is historical sale from major crime, it iseas\
to be complacent. Therefore, students have .1
greater responsibility to look after their own in
terests.
There are a number of practical precautions we
can take everv day. We must rememlxT to lock
front and room doors because manv of the bur
glaries perpetrated on campus occur without
toned entry. 1 .ockcd doors, like extra street lights,
easily and eflectivelv deter most would-be Innglars.
Staff in dormitories and houses must stress to theii
residents the importance ol dosing I rout doors,
rather than leaving them propped < >peu for guests.
We must also considei activeh patrolling out
campus. More often than not, buiglaries could have
Ix'en prevented with a simple phone call to the po-

lid* department or In notifying other memlx'is ol
the house about an intruder. II you do not know a
person who is loitering around your house, alert the
residence stall! Hie extra eflbrt may pay oil.
Students should also he more aware of their
surroundings. If you run at night, go with some
one else. If you can't find anyone to go with, con
sider working out at 'Iresidder Fitness ('.enter or
Arrillaga. Both facilities are open until 2 a.m. If
you Have a late class or section, tell your roommate
or a friend w hen you expect to return.
These suggestions should Ik- part of every
one's daily routine, and we all have .1 responsibil
ity to make this campus a safe and comfortable
plat e. I he crime rate at Stanford is low and the
campus is, generally speaking, verv safe. We are
very luck\ in (his respect. I lowever, we should still
he aware of the issues surrounding personal safe
ty. Periodic incidents, such as burglaries, should
remind students and I diversity administrators
to re-evaluate their roles in campus security.
