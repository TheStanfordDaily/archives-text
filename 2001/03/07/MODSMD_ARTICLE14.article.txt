in no particular order:
I lie "Preacher Politician Overbear

I he first example finds the columnist
assuming the role of a wordy preacher, an
idealistic politician or an overbearing
mother, depending on the mood and
background of the author.
I he columnist uses his or her 700
words like a pulpit / podium / phone call
fiom home to give us advice about our
lives and how to go about living them
(with attempts at humor interspersed at
random). 1-it her we do too much
or not enough . and it really
doesn't matter what action verbs fill the
blanks.
