Daily article did not include
medical evidence'
It amused me to learn, from "Stanford
escapes widespread lest.isv use" (Mar. 5),
that the Drug Knforcemeni Administration
considers "drv mouth and "reddening of
the exes" to be among the "serious health
1 isks posed bx marijuana, even as millions
of prescription and over-the-countci drug
users accept sue h side cllce I son a elailx basis.
In addition, with respeet to its more ex
aggeratcd claims, the DKA demonstrates
that it is bettei at en fore cinent than with
keeping up with the research. I 01 instance,
a IWW survex of K.nse-i patients revealed
that M percent ot elailx marijuana smokers
sought treat incut fore olds, flu and hronc 111-
tts oxer a six-ve-.u period, compared to WW
percent toi lion-smokers — liardlx a ring
ing endorsement of the DFA's claimed link
lietween 111.11 iju.ma and hronc lntis.
Furthermore, a 1 *>7 l( L\ paper con
cluded that "findings ... do not support an
association Ix'tween even heavx, regulai
niari]iiana smoking and the dexelopment of
chronic obstructive lung disease." 111 tact, a
IW7 Australian studx of individuals who
had smoked marijuana on a dailx or xvecklx
biisis for an ax e-rage of 19 xears revealed a
lower prevalence of einplix sema and asthma
than in the general population.
1 xvould hope that, in reporting on di ug
effects in the- future, I'lie Dailx would con
sider rev iewing the medical evidence tor it
self. rather than taking the word of an en
forcement agencv with an obvious agenda.

Letter-writer 'owes Stanford
Democrats an apology'
I was appalled at Henry Towsner's gross
niischaracterization of Krista Glaser's words
in his letter ("Student responds to Denis' let
ter," Mar. 5). Nowhere in her letter ("Daily
article includes 'conservative propaganda'")
does Glaser suggest th.it it is appropriate tor
the government to intervene in even situa
tion. .Any reasonable person who reads
C ilaser's letter in its entirety would see that the
line Towsner quotes is taken out of context.
Many conservatives reject the notion that the
government should play any significant role
in improving people's lives. Democrats be
lieve that people suffer when the govern
ment does not intervene in appropriate situ
ations. That principle is the one Glaser was
advocating in her letter; indeed, she says gov
ernment can play "a kev role" in advancing
the human condition, not all roles.
Contrary to Towsner's claims in another

part of his le tte r, (.l.isei tievct suggested that
the government could en should ignore the
(.iven the tae 1 that the ('.onstitu
tie >11 sets upthegovei nment. theverv notion ol
the former be ing subordinate to the lattei is ut
terlv t ielu iilous Again, anv reasonable person
would rcaji/e that "government intrusion"
refers onlx to Constitutional government ac
tion that would better s< K'ietx as a whole.
No Deinoe rat would argue that the gov
ernment should arbitralilx restrict a consti
tutional freedom, whethei it's ihe- First
Amendment's right to tree speech, the-
Ninth and I 1 111 amendments' right to pri
vacy (which protect a woman's right to
e boose- to have an abortion, ac cording to the
Supreme ( ourt) or anx other right.
I'm not in a position to speak on behalf of
the Stanford Democrats (although I am a
member). Still, I can only conclude- that
Fowsner eitliei doesn't know much about
government or simplv wanted to take a
c heap shot at a reputable organization In
blatantlv twisting the- words of its spokcsjHT
son. In either tase. 1 think he owes (ilasei
and the Stanford Dciiick rats an apologv.

Enforcement 'necessary for
constitutional rights'
I feel obligated to respond to the recent
attacks against the Stanford Democrats and
my own personal beliefs. In his letter on
Monday ("Student responds to Denis' let
ter"), Henn lowsner questions tm Mippon
of governmental intervention. Roe v. Wade
and 112 irst Amendment rights. He names
these values as contradictory in nature.
I am confused as to whv someone sees
such principles .is incongnient. Indeed, the
Dem<xTatic Partv thoroughly supports gov
ernmental activism, the First Amendment's
implications and pro-choice causes. Where
as some may question the Roc decision as

one that "limited thegovei ninent from ban
ning abortion," the fact is that Roe inter
preted the(onstitntion.il right for personal
privacy. Indeed. Roc is not about limiting
government, but understanding that gov
ernmental intervention is essential to secur
ing one's constitutional rights.
Amendments guarantee rights rather
than limit government, and .1 constitutional
right means nothing without the enforce
ment to guarantee that right, hi other
words, enforcement implies making gov
ernment more involved and more active —
right 111 line with democratic philosophv.
I his seems obvious to me. I would ask
whether those who challenge ibis believe
ih.it enforcement is not necessan for consti
tutional tights. I would hope we .ill agree
that a right is useless without the s<« ial ,uid
economic support of .1 g< >vei mnent to allow
us to exercise our rights. However, il this
does not seem obvious to I owsner. I'd ask
him and anvone else to inform themselves
through action ratlu i than talk
