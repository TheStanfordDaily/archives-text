the difficulties presented h\ California's large
si/e and di\ersitv. Acccuding to Kirst. one of the
most troubling trends in education todav is the
loss of confidence in local sc liool oflic ials.
"We (..in*i mi< roni.inage [schools] from the
state level," Kii si said. " I"he state should figure
out what is to be done, but let local (listen is fig
ure out how its to be done."

"Reforms have rained down from Sacra

preparation programs, new ( barter s( Inm>l s\s

and s< hools whose students test well.
Kii st spoke enthusiastic alb about new b es
tablished tests, which will be administered
statew ide to students from grades two through
II this spring. 1 "he exam, which Kirst sa\s is
"much more difficult" than existing tests, will
recjuire about ,'W."> minutes and be given ovei

S( hools also need to oven 0111 c the obstacle

because of salan concerns and otliei circ 11111-
stances. s( hools have "trouble attra< ting quali

"You c an have all the tests 111 the world, but
if there's no one to teach |thc material], then

Despite these issues. Kirst said he believes
that the state is "putting the pieces togethci and

Furthermore, Kirst encouraged learning
from chattel schools latlici than dismissing
them.
" I hc\ re liiglibderegulated, and tbe\ don't
have to have |undergo] collective bargaining
unless ibe\ ( boose to," whit b enables more em
phasis to be placed 011 education latliet than
administration. Kii st said.
Kiisi ,ilso pushed for the c reation of a pro

gram ton - English-language learners, because
voters previouslx passed Proposition 22/. dis
mantling the bilingual education system in
plat e.
However. knst stressed that these sugges
tions are pist .1 start.
"\<> one thing vou reatl about will be a silver
bullet," he said. "We need a big approach, more
than this, and it will take several years to get
there.
Hammer agreed, bin said that she believes
"we have turned a corner" in education reform.
I Jammer (ailed tor public patience and en
durance ot politic .il support tor reform.
"Politicians must have the will to sta\ the
course. I hat has not been the c ase in the past 10
t«> I") vears. I he bar is high, and it should be
high, but we are c bai ting new grounds, and it
will take a tew vears." she said.
I lamiuet also commented 011 the lack ot pol
ic \ regarding English-language learners.
"I believe it's .1 fundamental right [for Eng
lish-language learners] to have the same op
portune to learn as kuls whose first language
is English.' she said.
Hammer also echoed kn st s support of local
involvement.
"I think it's ver\ demeaning to professionals
for [state education of lit ials] to sit in Sacramen
to and tell them how to teat h." she said. "1 am
in >1 so presumptuous as to think I sh<>uld know
more about how to teach a class ot third
graders than the third-grade teacher."


Education Prof Michael Kirst spoke yesterday about reforming California's
state schools. He said the state was on the right track, but needed to work on
making more progress.
