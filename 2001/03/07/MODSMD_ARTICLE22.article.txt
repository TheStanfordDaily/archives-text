## NCAA bids await Pac-10 winners 
### MALCOLM LEVINE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With Selection Sunday approaching, the
Pacific 10 Conference staged some serious
battles last week among the top teams in the
league, and, as the dust settles, it looks as it the
Pac-10 should have five teams in the NCAA
Tournament.
In last week's games, no Pac-10 team
plaved its wav out of a tournament bid, while
Southern California might well have salvaged
its season with a huge victory over California.

MEN'S PAC-10 ROUNDUP

UCLA 79. Cal 75
On 1 hursdav, I CIA avenged its 29-point
I<»ss last month in Berkeley to defeat Cal, 79-
7."), and win its eighth eon set lit i ve game.
Finishing the game on an 18-8 run, the
Bruins combined their frenetic full-court
press with a balanced offensive attack, as all
five starters stored in double figures.
Karl Watson led the Bruins' comebai k with
20 points (11 in the second half), while for
ward Matt Barnes played another great all
around game, registering 13 points, nine re
bounds and seven assists.
Both teams shot the ball well for the game
I ( KA shot 17 percent from the field while
( al shot 48 percent — but the Brums' defense
clamped down on the ( al attack in the final
five minutes.
( al forward Sean Lampley paced the
(Jolden Bears with 19 points and 13 re
bounds. However, he could not get it done
down the stretch as the Bruins clawed their
wa\ back into the game.
( '.al lost despite outrebounding I ( '.LA, 34-
27, meaning that the Bears found a wav to

lose while outshooting and outrebounding
their opponent, which is not an easv feat.
Arizona 104, Oregon 65
On Saturday, Arizona punished Oregon foi
its upset over the Wildcats earlier this season,
demolishing the Ducks, 104-05.
In his final game at the Mi Kale Center, se
nior Loren Woods had 17 rebounds, seven re
bounds and tour assists, as all five \ri/ona
starters scored in double figures.
Fonvard Michael Wright led the team with IS
points in 20 minutes, while |ason (.Gardner plaved
an impeccable game at the point for the Wilde .its
with 11 points. 10 assists and onlv one turnover
lite game was never even close. I he Wild
cats led 55-25 .it halftime and by as main .is 51
points in the second halt as Arizona shot an as
tounding 00 percent from the field.
The Pac-10's second-leading scorer, Duck
forward Bryan Bracev, was held to jnst seven
points b\ the Wildcats' bruising front-line,
which snapped Bracev"s streak of 21 straight
games of double-figure scoring.
The Skinny
With just two games remaining lor each
team, it would take a inirac le. inc hiding two h »ss
es In ( aland I S(and a lot ot upsets in other
conference tournaments, for the Pac-10 not to
send five teams to the N( .A\ Tournament.
While the Cardinal is a lock as a No. I seed.it
looks as if Arizona and I ('.L\ will be No. M seeds,
but it is too earlv to tell because much ot the
seeding process relies on the results ot confer
ence tournaments.
I lowever, one tiling is for sure: Both Arizona
and UCIA are peaking at the right time. 1 lie
Wildcats have won seven ot eight games, and. as
their annihilation of Oregon showed, tliev are
beginning to look somewhat like- the team that

was ranked No. I to start the season
It this sounds familiar, it should In 1007. a
higlih touted \i izona squad mulct ic lucwd all
season before coming on strong in the last tew
weeks to get a No. 5 seed in the loin nament.
And w hat happened next? Arizona cut clow n
the nets behind the hot pla\ of Mike Bibln and
Miles Simon.
I his is not to sa\ that it w ill defiuiteh happen
again, but one could bet that no te am wants to
face Arizona in the tournament. \i i. ona has the
talent and the depth to beat am team in the
country, and it seems as it it is putting every
thing together at the pertec t time.
As far as < aland I S( go. both teams have
1 0-0 records, while Cal stands one ;.nne np in
league plav. ( al is probabh in with its lOcon
tcrence wins, regardless of tins week's games
against Ai izona and Ai izona State
()ne win would push the Bears to the ni \sti
cal 20-win mark, while beating \i izona would
be helpful in garnering a highei seed. 1 ithei
wav. Cal has plaved its wa\ into tlu Big Dance
with its solid pla\ throughout tlu season, and,
with a solid week, the Beat s < oulcl lie- as high as
a No. 0 oi No. 7 seed
With Saturdav's win over ( al, I SC. probabh
saved its season and its tourname nt ( bailees.
I laving lost loui of its last si\ games, inc hiding a
two-point loss to the Cardinal on I Inn sclav, the
I rojans beat Cal, 7-1-00. behind Brandon
(lran\ ille's 22 points and si\ assists
I he team has been sliding tinoiighout the
last month ever since its loss at Maples on Feb. I.
but the big victon over Cal jiM might be
enough to snap the I rojans out ot it.
With games remaining against W ashington
and Washington State, the I rojans are in a pel -
lee t position to finish the season with 21 wins.


SASHA SIDDHARTHA/The Stanford Daily File
Senior Jarron Collins attempts a shot in the Cardinal's victory against Wash
ington State earlier this season. While other Pac-10 teams battle for an
NCAA Tournament bid, Stanford awaits a possible No. 1 seed in the West
ern bracket.
(urrentlv No. 21 in the ever
iiuit.il RIM ratings, the 1 rojans
would be in il the season ended
t(Klav, but the\ still have to fend otl
two spoilers before receiving .i hid.
Assuming tli.it l'S(l pulls off
hotli wins, the I rojans .ire proba
bly looking at a No. 7 or No. 8
seed, and, with then plixsit.il st\le
of plav, tliev could ver\ well he
making some noise with .i couple
of upsets.
As f.ir as brat ketologv goes for
the Par-10, that's about it. because
it would take .i miracle loi am
other team to get an at-large bid.
Oregon looked promising

about .i month ago. but eight losses
m nine games is more than enough
to kn<H k.i team from the "bubble
to fighting foi an N.l I . bid.
\i i/ona State and ()iegon State
have also looked good .il times, but
neithei team has neaiK enough
wins for am soi t of i onsiclcraUon.
Regardless, the l\i< Id should
be well represented with five teams.
It will be interesting — and \it.il to
the I'ac-lO's tonrilament suecess
to see how the selettion committee
weighs the strength of the l'ac-10
when seeding teams like C.aland
I SC.. compared to teams m the
A( ( oi big I en.
Ibe l'ac-10 li.is been fairb
strong throughout the season, and
its teams could definiteh use an
edge in tournament seeding foi
sue iess in the Hie 1 )ance.
