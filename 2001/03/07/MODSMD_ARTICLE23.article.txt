States to a second-place finish.
After nearly four vears at C\ press.
Wing and Beck both left to train else
where for their senior years of high
school, Bee k traveled to Pennsylvania to
work out with the Pai kettes. Wing moved
to Maryland to train with kell\ I!ill. who

"It was .1 realh good decision.' Wing
said. "It was hard being awav from home,
but niv coaches and teammates there
were really good."
In Maryland, Wing lived and trained
with Robin Phelps, w 110 is also a 112 reshman
011 the Stanford team.

Wing took some tune off between lea\ -

self to li ving to make the ()lympic team.
She narrow Iv missed the (>l\ mpic 11 i

off.
"After we recruited and signed l.ind
sav. [the coaching staff] went to watc li her
a number of times. Kvery time, we could
see her improving and getting her
strength back," (look said.
"She was just starting to hit hei stride
w hen the trials came up. I lad she had an
other six months, she might have had a
reallv good shot at making the team, but
the timing was just off. We had seen that
improvement, though, and we knew she
could continue to improve when she got
here."
Wing wanted to come to Stanford as
much as the team wanted her. She had
also been considering Florida and Mic lii
gan, but, after being accepted to Stan
ford. she cancelled plans to visit other
schools.
"I fell in love with everything about
Stanford when 1 came for in\ recruiting

Wing has enjoved the change from the
competitive world of elite gymnastics to

I he supportive environment on the (cam.
"1 reallv like competing as a team. Its
)iist a lot more tnn." she said. "I also don't

she thinks Wing lias the piitential to lie ail
All-Amerie an and even a national cham
