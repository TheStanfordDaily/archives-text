# Living with Jarron: a rewarding experience

Note: The origin/il version of this column ran
in The Dailx on October 20. 1999.
The first day of my freshman
Orientation seems a blur of
new fates, new ac ronyms and
very new dreadlocked RA s
who somehow knew mv name from the
moment 1 stepped, wide-eved, into the
pandemonium of Alondra move-in.
But the one memory that stands out

among the rest — and
the out" that will be
with tm- tor many veai s
to comt' — is the mo
ment 1 met my
r< >ommate.
Trudging to my
door with m\ suitcases
in hand and my mom
in tow. 1 craned tnv

neck to read the name
next to mine on the door — the name ot
the person 1 would he spending the next
year with.
Ileinga huge sports tan, you (an imag
ine my surprise and excitement to see the
name of one of Stanford's most pri/ed
basketball recruits.
It ran something along the lines ot
"Holy shit, mother, do vou have an\ idea
who that is?" She didn't.
Little did 1 know that this excitement
could in no way prepare me lor the shot k
that was to come.
As the first ones to arrive, m\ mom
and 1 set to work throwing sheets on the
bed and clothes in the closet.
That's when my (i-foot-lO roommate
walked into the room — Iblowed shorth
thereafter by his 7-loot tall twin brother.
An important aside here. 1 am in no
way the tallest person in the world, mea
suring in.it. let's just say, a tew iiu lies sh\
of six feet (in the right shoes). \l\ mom,
on the other hand, stands in at .i whop
ping 4-11.
All ot a sudden, that seemingly spa
cious Alondra double seemed |iist a little
bit smaller. It was a little bit like being a
Lilliputian trapped in the land <>112 the
Amazon people. (Nevermind the tat I that
our room was bookended In the rooms ot
a member ot the women's volleyball team
and a member of the men's vollevball
team.)

M\ mom spent the entire aftci 110011
craning her neck to i.ilk to |arron <md
Jason and tlieii fainih
I'm suit-1)\ the time she made it hai k
to I exas, a trip to tlit* t hiropractoi was
not out of the question.
Perhaps tin- funniest moment ol li t-sli
man veai occurred when Paul Collins,
the tv\ins' dad and one ol the friendliest
people vou (ould evei meet, g«>i liapped
inside the frame ol the bed hew.i s n \ ing
to lolt and pated around .1 l>it like .1 < aged
rhino until we could c\ti it ate him.
Despite the obvious ph\sital diHei
enct'.s between |arron and ni\ sell, we he
tame great friends ovei tlit course ol
Ireshman veai ami roomed tngethci foi
t)ur first three veai s at St.inlbrtl.
A great example ol the tlilleient es be
tween us was the configuration <>l 0111
room that first veai. Above <>tn closets,
near the t tiling, was .1 shell where I kept
niv suitcase and C.IY bt>oks and otliei
things I wouldn't need tluoughout the
veai. 1 hat's where |arron kepi his tootli
brusli and his shoes.
I have, of course, endureti .1 gre.it deal
ol ribbing I'roni m\ Irientls here and bat k
home about the slight difference in
statin e between the two of us.
It's just not evei \ tla\ that \<>u see peo
ple of sut h different si/es in the same \ i
sual frame — |arron and |ason don't
seem nearlv as tall stantling tin the com 1
next to Inn Young 01 ( ant is lion hart It.
I lie Parents' Weekend tlinneis with
out families are alwavs <|iialit\ cometlv.
Iwo ve.irs ago. the entile timing rot>lll at
Mac Arthur Pai k seemed to turn and
laugh m unison as m\ mom hugged
Jason gtMxlbve somewhere between Ins
knee .uitl his hip.
It was alwa\s at onstant battle to dispel
the great exaggerations of the tlillei cut es
111 our heights.
K.veti the lolks .it Stanford Maga/ine
couldn't get it light. 1 wo summers ago,
tlicv ran an extensive feature on the sut -
cess ol the \thlctii Department.
One sect it tn of the stt>i\ centered
around the tinit|ue li\ing situation 111
w hit h Stanfortl's athletes are pan ed with
"evervdax students.' I hete was tme cer
tain pairing — dubbed "the odd couple"
