How many times have you hiked past
"The ('.layv" in White Pla/a, the "Burgheis ot
(".alais" in the front of the Quad. "The
I'll inker" in front of Mevei Library or any ot
the sculptures around c anipus yvithout stop
ping to examine these yvoi ks of art?
There are over outdoor sculptures on
I niversitv grounds, making it .111 "outdoor
museum" of sorts. Kac h sculpture has its own
unique background and interpretation.
Because ot its location, the most common
ly vieyved sculpture on campus is White
Memorial fountain (19t>4), referred to by
students as" I lie ( layv.
The story behind this sculpture helps to
explain its exceptional design. According to
Rex Yaughan, thedocentchaii at the('alitor

Arts Center, the Whites were .1 family who
contributed to the building of White Pla/a.
I wo of their sons attended Stanford. One
son was a fighter pilot who died in .1 fiery
crash, \\liile- the other was an .md lovet of
sui ting yvhodroyvued in the Pa< ifi<
The s( ulpture is .1 ti ibute to the two sons.
If you look .it the sculpture, it might appeal
to be .1 large flame rising out of the watei of
the fountain. I he sculpture brings togethei
tire and watei .is .1 memorial to the deaths of
the Whites' two soils.
I'liecampus is tilled with Rodin sculptures
like the "Burghers of(.alais' (1 S9f>) and " 1 he
I'liinker" (1880). The story of the Burgheis
of C '.alais is famous. I he six burghers ottered
their lives to save the Krent h city of ( alais.
1 .ess wellknoyvn. hoyvever, is that the lives of
the six men yvere later spared by the King ot
Kngland.
If vou look closely at the faces of the six
burghers, you may notice that each man re
sponds differently to the sacrifice. One
burgher li.is .1 look of complete indignation.
Another burghet. according to Yaughan.
has "an Kxcedrin licadac lie" â€”his face re
flects intense feai of the death tliat .mails
him. I lie oldest man has .1 look of resigna
tion. eniphasi/ing that nothing < .111 be done
to liitn that lias not been done before. Ka< li

burghers' fate, Yaughan said.
"The I hinkcr," located 111 front of \level
Library , is one of the most famous si ulptures
yvorlclwide. A close inspection reveals that the
thinker's eyes have no pupils, his ears have
something covei ing them, and his hands at e
placed over his mouth 111 ordci to silence
liini. Yaughan s.iid Rodin believed that true
original thought occui s only when one shuts
oti all communication from the outside yvorld
and examines oneself (loseh.
One ot the most controversial pieces on
campus is"(iay 1 .ilx-ration" (1081) by (.eorge
Segal. located in the Main Quad near the
Mathcmatic s Department. I he s< ulpture is a
copy of a piece located in Sheridan Park, in
New York ( ity. at the site ot .1 y iolent alterca
tion lx'tyveeti homosexuals and the poli< e.
I he artist has created life-si/e statues ot
two men and two women. I he women sit 011
a park bench, caught 111 a moment ot sile nt
conversation. The men stand in front of an
other bench, one with Ins hand on the other's
shoulder.


KEITH ITO/The Stanford Daily File
Donated by Stanford parents in memory of
their sons, White Memorial Fountain is better
known as 'The Claw." Its shape symbolizes
fire rising out of water, commemorating the
two sons' hobbies.
" I bis piece is there in order to
invite people to sit on the Ik-ihli
and take part in the exhibit."
Yaughan said.
