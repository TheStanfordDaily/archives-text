# Technology needs consumer safeguards

### JEFF NEGRETTE 
. Looking around qui world today. it is easy to
lie a champion ol technology. So main wonder
ful conveniences. so much more prwUwimty
gid so main more possibilities are available to us
now that were oik e relegated to science fiction.
* ( an vou imagine vour life without the auto
mobile. the television, the light bulb or even
more mundane < reations like over-the-counter
painkiller, indooi plumbing and cveglasses?
These advancements all conti ibute to I he ({iialitx
of even \inerican's life and constitute the met
rics used to evaluate the development of other
sflx leties around the wot Id.
Progress is hard t< > argue against, especially
vyien it is so quantifiable and so broadh clis-
I K'i setl among the masses. Regardless of political
ideologv. growth is generally g<H>d. and econo
mists are attributing mote and more of our do
mestic product gains to technologic.il advances
thai make people more produt live in everything
iljey do.
But, aside from general irrational anti-tech
ublogv at guments or resistant e from companies
that fear new let Imologies will linn theii com
petitive advantage, should more restraint be
placed < >11 the adoption of new technology.-
I here are ample reasons for us to be wor
ried. l-t>l example, the implications of smog
.uid pollution from fossil fuels are still being re
start lied, but it's cleai now thai the inventors
of the combustion engine did not ilunk too
much about the harmful long-term elicits of
ilieii invention. Dangers range from minor
respiratory complications to life-threatening
asthma aitat ks.
Another souk cot fuel — uranium in nut leai
reactois — otitis tremendous efficiency gains
ovei petroleum products, but leaves behind its
own pollutants, some of \n liu li remain toxic fot
centuries. Aside from waste-disposal problems.
11lit lear technology c ai lies the risk of accidental
tontaminatiou, w hie h has had devastatingeffet is
liistoi ic alh.
Nuc leai radiation, though tlangerous, is far
less common than the übiquitous electromag
netic radiation spread b\ communications
equipment used to broadcast everything from
iadio to cell phones, (iiven the popularity of
wireless technology , several studies have been
contlut ted. some of whit Ii raise concerns alx>ul
the (Lingers of radio-telephones. With allega
tions of dangers ranging from brain tumors to
loss of cognitive function, t lit its question the
safety of radio frequency transmissions that
bombard us wherever we go.
With the advent of so many powerful but
untested technologies, the question arises as it»
who should protect the public s welfare. C .learlv.
there are risks posed by these innovations, but it
is less c lear y\ho should underwrite them. 1 liree
possible blame-takers are consumers, producers
.ind the government.
While, historically, society has felt that the

legal doctrine of <aveat emptoi. or "let the buyer
beware," should apply to some degree tor
users of untested new products, several
changes have driven a paradigm shift in peo
ple's attitutUuta—~~ r
I he first relates to a buy ei s relative ignorant e
and inc apacitv to evaluate the risks he is assum
ing. For the purchaser of a cell phone, he c annot
possibly know as much about the product's po
tential for harm oi good as its manufacturer.
Fin tliei more, he lac ks thecapac it\ to narrow the

pre-existing knowledge gap of w Inch the seller is
obviously aware.
An economic analy sis also places responsi
bility on the seller to evaluate the risk under
the concept of "cheapest cost avoider." This
doc trine specifies that the responsible party
should be determined by yvhoever is able to
avoid the costs at the loyvest price. Because re
search must be done on the dangers of cell
phone technology , economies of stale yvoultl
me I it ate that a coi pt nation would be more cost
effective in this pursuit than each owner of a
cell phone would.
Finally, there's the argument that produc
ers should shoulder the burden for ensuring
the safety of their products simply because they
are profiting from the product's sale. As mer
chants in the transaction, they extend certain
implicit promises that the products will func
tion as one might expect. 1 his concept is relat
ed to a dot trine in contract law known as an im
plied warranty.
Despite these viewpoints, many yvoultl agree
that consumers must take responsibility for
their own welfare. I hose of a libertarian per
suasion may t eat h the same conclusion, but on
the grounds that intliy ichials are the ones most
capable of determining their unique interests
and risk-preferences.
Either way. there are problems with charging
consumers with the duty to protect themselves
from the dangers of technology. The most im
portant of these is the fact that consumers cannot
exclude themselves from ex|x>sure to risky tec h

nologv. .it ieast not easilv. While tin- option to
move to Alaska is still available, tew realist icalh
possess tbe abilitv to retrain from highwav tise oi
will find it prac ti< ,il to w.ilk around in .11 acliation
suit. Both ot tbese steps would l>e n«ess.ir\ to
mitigate exposure to the dangers posed l>\ cell
phones.
I Ins uni(jne dynamic ot non-consensual risk
exposure has oul\ recently Ixrome an issue be
(ause ot the invasive and iu\ isible ch.irat tei istu s
(intent technologv < .in have. I hus. consumers
cannot respond ration.ill\ to risks the\ are not
even aware ot or which are so übiquitous that
the) must resort to isolation tor protection.
I he third option, which has proved popular
in some regions ot the world, is to rcl\ on the gov
ernment to assess the risks ot technology on out
welfare. I ntortunatelv, given that some ot the
risks discussed above are the product ot govei u
inental innovations, it is dittic ult to assess the gov
ernment's willingness 01 (apac it\ to tin nighttul
1\ test the consequences ot its own products, let
.done test those ot the (ommen ial sector.
Furthermore, most products do not undergo
formal review prior to public release. For those
pioduc ts that are regulated, institutional bodies
lac k the capacitv and sophistication to assess the
clangers ot even new product. Also, these agen
cies ma\ contribute to the damage technology
causes bv reviewing products, an act that con
sumers often falselv identih .is endorsement or
certification bv the government.
While this overview of potential responsible
parties tna\ appear to alienate the task to pro
due ei s, problems remain. I be first of these is liq
uiditv; while it makes sense to hold producci s re
sponsible tot the harm t licit products cause, en
tot ccment nun prove impossible it a gi\cii pro
ducer is insolvent and docs not have the re
sou rc es to undo the damage it has done.
A similar point can be made tor inaccessible
producers, who operate outside the jut isclic Hon
of the I nited St.ites 01 who are able to conceal
their identity, like computer hackers. A third
concern around producet liability is the appear
ance of a conliict of interest. It ma\ provediflic ult
fora company to trul\ produce a neutral and ob
jective risk assessment report when its viabilitv,
including management's stex k options and em
ployees' abiltt\ to remain employed, would be
threatened by a negative conclusion.
Fo resolve these shot (comings. there is a ven
important role for the government to fill, which
it currentlv appears incapable of doing. Despite
the reluctance of several agencies to formalize
the responsibility to review these new innova
tions. it may no longer be an option to leave this
task to consumers and producers.
The government, either through the use of its
existing agency groups or with the help ot a
newly chartered independent institution (i.e. the
Federal Reserve), must better meet tbe needs ot
its citi/ens bv performing this invaluable role.
