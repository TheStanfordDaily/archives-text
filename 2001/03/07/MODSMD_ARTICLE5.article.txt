## Psychology prof. works with local police to assess officers' attitudes 
### GERALD MITCHELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In an attempt to shed some light on
the issue of racial profiling, Assoc. Psy
chology Prof |ennifcr Khcrhardt is
( in tenth (onductinga face perception
stuch to examine whether faces with
certain characteristics are associated
with crime.
I he study. conduc ted with the San
Mateo Police Department, came
about as a result of the "Racial Profil
ing Initiative" within the Roundta
bles Project of Comparative Studies
in Race and Ktlinicitv at Stanford. Ac -
cording to April Young, the director
of the Roundtables Projec t, the pro
gram is designed to I.k ilitate rela
tionships between faculty and the

community with respect to applied
research.
Kbcrhardt's study examines the
extent to which officet s associate par
ticular types of faces with crime. I he
study invoked 182 law enforcement
personnel from the San Mateo ( oun
t\ Sheriffs Office. They were shown
faces of 10 black Americans or of 111
white Americans.
Some officers were asked to exam
ine each face and to rate it on how
stereotypically black or white it was.
Some officers were asked to make
judgments of attractiveness. The re
maining officers were asked make an
intuitive judgment about whether the
pet son had committed a crime.
" 1 he popular discourse about
racial profiling is filled with pre
sumptions about the perceptions and
attitudes of police officers," l.ber
hardt said. "For instance, those who
think racial profiling ts occurring are
likely to think that the officers are
prejudiced, that they hold negative

stereotypes about people of ( olor and
that the\ assot iate blat k people with
< rime."
Although Kberhardt believes that
this stuth might yield valuable re
search focused <>n oHiteiV beliefs or
perceptions. she warned against lump
ing to corn lusions regarding behavior
or rat ial profiling practices of specific
offit ers.
I lit- studs is still in its preliminary
stages, and results have proven to be
inconclusive thus far.
" 1 his stud\ is .1 first step toward de
veloping .1 fullet pit tut e of .i complex
social dynamic." Kberhardt saitl.
The Roundtables Project has also
decided to partner with the S.iii
Mateo Police Department to fat ilitate
.i regional dis< ussion on rat ial profil
ing. Ihe partnership seemed very
natural to Voting, considering what
she saw .is a genuine interest by San
Mateo ('.ounty Sheriff Don 1 lorslev in
