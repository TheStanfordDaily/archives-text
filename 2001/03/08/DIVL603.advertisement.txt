the University of the Western Cape (also in the Cape Town
area). We will place one advanced doctoral student, currently
enrolled at Stanford, in each location to teach for two academic
semesters, beginning in July 2001 and running through June of
2002 (or if the student wishes, for the South African academic
year, which runs from late January to December 2002). Each
teaching fellow will receive a stipend of $20,000, sufficient to
cover travel, books, and living expenses. A half-time teaching

sertation. Applications are sought in the following disciplines:
