about thousands of organizations, the ellorts and
resources remain milt li too oriented toward (lali
lornia, and especially the Bay Area.
Stanford prides itself on being an ultra-pres
tigious national, and even international, univer
sity. Students from all over the I nitetl States and
around tlir world ct)ine here for the best educa
tional training and extracurricular activities,
which they hope will lead to unparalleled future
opportunities. In order for the I nivcrsit\ to live
up to its reputation, il must serve those of its stu-

dents who wish to work outside California, as
well as those who want to stay in the state.
Stanford's student population remains far
more geographically diverse than the organiza
tions and companies that the C11 )C 1 brings to

uate population, onl\ I I percent hail from (lali
fornia, while 51 percent come from other U.S.
states and f> percent from foreign countries. And
the (lalifornia contingency shrinks every vear (a
mere 10 percent of the Class of 2003 calls the
Cioltltki State home). In addition, Stanford's
graduate students are even more diverse, with a
1111it h larger group from abroad.
I he fact that people choose to attend Stan
lord does not necessarily mean that the I niver
sit\\ students hope to work and live in (lalifor
nia at tti gi ad nation. In fad, the vast majority of
the I iliversit\ s out-of-state students, as well as a

substantial proportion of its native (ialifornians,
will opt to go elsewhere for etnployinent, c hoos
ing either to return home or to live somewhere
else entirely.
(•ranted, the intense localization of work
opportunities is understandable. Most busi
nesses. not-for-piofits. national and interna
tional government agencies cannot at lord to
come to Stanford. I hese organizations often
lack both the financial and human resources
to recruit at Stanford, or even to set up a booth
at .1 job fair. Thev don't have the money for
these endeavors, nor are thev guaranteed to
find .1 Stanford student who ultimately joins
their organization. Onlv the corporate behe
moths, wealthy investment banks, consulting
agencies and high-tech companies (main of
which are located in Silicon Valley anvvvav)
possess means suflicient for these ends. Be
sides these companies, onlv local organiza-

lions can participate in (IDC functions with
minimum financial impact.
Nevertheless, this employment localization
remains a problem that the CIIKI needs to recti

it stands now, the (11)(1 will write "referral let
ters'' for students to use at the career counseling
departments of the college or university closest
to their homes. But this is not enough.
The C11)(1 should network extensively with
the career offices of peer institutions like Har
vard, Northwestern, Duke and other schools
from every region of the I nited States. Such ef
forts would benefit non-Stanford students, too.
