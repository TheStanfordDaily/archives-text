accepted into Stanford. 1 called
home after school that dav and mv
younger brother answered the phone.
After much persuasion, he ran dou li

An eternity later, he returned and
said that there was a letter from Stan

Affirmative action hurts minorities
because it allows non-minorities this un

bul no one should have to endure those
feelings ol self-doubt.
What mam people l.nl to reali/e, in
their blanket rejection ol affirmative ac

being a minorit\ 111 a world that does not

America that is divided, socially, eco

Affirmative action serves to compen

testing system and. 111 some cases, for
lowered socioeconomic status that tnav
inhibit students from reaching their true
academic potentials in under-funded
public school systems.
1 hesitate to mention the socioeco
nomic implications of affirmative ac tion
because, despite popular belief, not all
minorities come from economicalh poor
neighborhoods a id school systems.
However, there exists a direct correla
tion between one's racial makeup, eco
nomic background and subsequent stan
dardized test stores. So affirmative ac
tion attempts to ameliorate this seeming
ly unfair applic ation process by plac ing
less value on lesi stores and grade point
averages. (After .til, how can these sys
tems measure the intelligence or poten
tial of a person anyway?)
Affirmative action evaluates an intli
vidual's experiences and triumphs
amidst adversity as a true indicator of
strength. What affirmative action at
tempts to say is that mavbe there is some
merit 111 surviving as a minority in a soci
ci\ that historically is not all-inclusive.
But let's not forget that Stanford's
"quota" system does not only benefit mi
norities. For all those students who have

parents and grandparents are alumni,

reevaluate vour stance on "quotas" and
"loopholes."
What bothers me most about the ar

Anti-alfir'inalive action activists argue
that we all grow up in an equal Americ a,

Mv problem with activists is simple:

public school systems.
1 hesitate to mention the socioeco
nomic implications of affirmative ac tion
because, despite popular belief, not all
minorities come from economicalh poor
neighborhoods a id school systems.
However, there exists a direct correla
tion between one's racial makeup, eco
nomic background and subsequent stan
dardized test stores. So affirmative ac
tion attempts to ameliorate this seeming
ly unfair applic ation process by plac ing
less value on lesi stores and grade point
averages. (After .til, how can these sys
tems measure the intelligence or poten
tial of a person anyway?)
Affirmative action evaluates an intli
vidual's experiences and triumphs
amidst adversity as a true indicator of
strength. What affirmative action at
tempts to say is that mavbe there is some
merit 111 surviving as a minority in a soci
ci\ that historically is not all-inclusive.
But let's not forget that Stanford's
"quota" system does not only benefit mi
norities. For all those students who have

parents and grandparents are alumni,
vou might want to take .i step back and
reevaluate vour stance on "quotas" and
"loopholes."
What bothers me most about the ar
gument against the existence of affirma
tive action is the sheer hvpocrisy ol it.
Anti-alfir'inalive action activists argue
that we all grow up in an equal Americ a,
