## We all deserve Stanford

I can still remember exactb where I
was and exacth how 1 felt the
minute I first found out ili.it I got
accepted into Stanford. 1 called
home after school that dav and mv
younger brother answered the phone.
After much persuasion, he ran dou li
st. ill s to check the mail as I waited in
silent praver.
An eternity later, he returned and
said that there was a letter from Stan
ford. " I luck or thin?" 1 veiled. M\

motion was — thcv

side folder, the first two paragraphs of
the acceptance letter, the full address of
the I niversit\ located on the outside of
the envelope and then driving home to

We all remember this da\. 1 bet — it
was an unbelievable feeling, accomplish
ing something of that magnitude. How
ever, my dav of exhilaration was cut
shot i In the negative reactions 1 received
from tin fellow students.
I was the first in niv higli school to
ever get accepted to Stanford, being
black at a predominantb white school,
this made me susceptible to an ama/ing
amount of critic ism. I knew what others
were thinking as I walked down the
halls: "She onl\ got in because of affir
mative action."
A few brave souls were even bold
enough to sa\ this to m\ face, forget all
the clubs I was in.the leadership expe
rience I had. the communit\ service
hours I spent, the four veats I plaved
\at sit\ basketball. tn\ honors status,
being ranked Hsth out of 900 students
and the not amazing but overall dec ent
SA I scores — all that was forgotten,
and foi the millionth time in my life. 1
was nothing more than just the black
girl.
Affirmative action hurts minorities
because it allows non-minorities this un
warranted sense of accomplishment.
Some non-minorities might think that
thcv deserve to be here, that tliev worked

I11 retrospect, all accepted applicants

c|uestion, .11 linn s, the reason behind ni\
acceptance. I "Iti111.itelv, 1 came to the
conclusion that I deserved this school,
bul no one should have to endure those
feelings ol self-doubt.
What mam people l.nl to reali/e, in
their blanket rejection ol affirmative ac
lion, is the difficult associated with
being a minorit\ 111 a world that does not
embrace that racial differente as an inte
gral component of Americanism. I nfbr
lunatelv, that whole "melting pot" theo
r\ never (|iiite caught on, resulting in an
America that is divided, socially, eco
nomical and culturally.
Affirmative action serves to compen
sate for a i ulturalh biased stand.11 cli/ed
testing system and. 111 some cases, for
lowered socioeconomic status that tnav
inhibit students from reaching their true
academic potentials in under-funded
public school systems.
1 hesitate to mention the socioeco
nomic implications of affirmative ac tion
because, despite popular belief, not all
minorities come from economicalh poor
neighborhoods a id school systems.
However, there exists a direct correla
tion between one's racial makeup, eco
nomic background and subsequent stan
dardized test stores. So affirmative ac
tion attempts to ameliorate this seeming
ly unfair applic ation process by plac ing
less value on lesi stores and grade point
averages. (After .til, how can these sys
tems measure the intelligence or poten
tial of a person anyway?)
Affirmative action evaluates an intli
vidual's experiences and triumphs
amidst adversity as a true indicator of
strength. What affirmative action at
tempts to say is that mavbe there is some
merit 111 surviving as a minority in a soci
ci\ that historically is not all-inclusive.
But let's not forget that Stanford's
"quota" system does not only benefit mi
norities. For all those students who have
