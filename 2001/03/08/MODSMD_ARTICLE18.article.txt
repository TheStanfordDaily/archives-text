Stanford 'shields us from uncomfortable
realizations about comfort and privilege'
1 have been disappointed with the train
ing of the recent conversation about free
speech and student safety in White Plaza.
Mike Mongan's Feb. 28 letter ("Free
speech important") argued that "many
white southerners in the 1950s found the
speech of Martin Luther King jr. and the
Student Nonviolent Coordinating Com
mittee ... both aggressive and threaten
ing." (>n Mar. 2 ("Solution to White f'la/a
speakers 'absurd' Andrew l'apson
added that "It is unconscion.ible to suggest
that students have the 'right' to be protec t
ed from anything outside their comfort
/ones. In our lives, we will all find peo pie
who make us uncomfortable, people who
disagree with us and people who hate us.'
These letters ignore the fact th.it hate
speech is a diflerent kind of'speech, affect
ing .i diflerent kind of people. It invades
much more than mere comfort /ones.
Marisa F.gerstrom's Feb. 28 letter ("Inci
dent in White Plaza highlights need tor ac
tion") describes the effects of this speech on
her — nausea, panic, contusion, fear of
physical violence and hesitation to move
freelv around campus. To me, that doesn't
sound like discomfort; that sounds like a vi
olation of the basic safety that we .ill need to
panic ipate fully in tlu- Stanford communi
ty. 1 will not argue that safety is or is not a
tight. It is, however, in the Ix-st interest of
the I niversitv to maintain the level of safe
ty nettssary tor students to do what Stan
ford ostensibly brought us here to do:
learn. Hate violence, including hate
speech, damages the safety of not only the
direct target, but of all those who observe it.

1 agree with I'apson ih.it comfort is not
.1 right. It is a reasonable need, Inn this Uni
versity already does too much to protect
the comfort of some of its students. By sur
rounding us with Nike's swooshes (not
only condoning this company's horren
dous labor practices, but feeding its profit
margin In offering our athletes' bodies as
advertising space), In paving unlivable
wages to the workers who feed and clean
up after lis while the Careei Development
('.enter oilers us workshops on negotiating
the highest possible starting salary, by
bringing to oui doorsteps job fairs with in
vestmcnt banking companies w hose activi
ties exacerbate socicxronomic stratifica
tion, Stanford shields us from the uncom
fortable reali/ation that much of our com
fort and privilege comes at the expense of
the safety (poverty is. after all, a rather un
safe condition) of others.
I hose who suffer hate speech in atmo
sphere of institutional and conununit\ si
lence lose their safety because of others'
comfort. Why did no one in White I'la/.i
that day restore Kgerstrom's safety In
speaking out against her degradation? 1
believe the answer to this question is com
plicated. Others, their sense ol safety also
harmed by this act of hatred, were legiti
mately afraid of becoming the direct tar
gets themselves. 1 can't say that I. also a
women's libber and homo and a Jew to
boot, would have been the first to rebut the
speaker's statements or even to make my
self noticeable by approaching Kgerstrom
to oiler words of concern.
What reason would I have to Ix-lieve
that my individual response would do
more than escalate the situation and add to
the casualties? More than stepping outside

ol my comfort /.one, responding would
have meant risking my safety.
In other words, the free speech rights of
everyone who remained silent out of fear
were violated, for speaking should not be
unsafe. The preacher, however, is not the
one who made speaking unsafe, rather
than merely uncomfortable, li is not his
personal responsibility to make speech
safe. I hat responsibility falls to the owners
oft he ( (institution — us, the people; to the
officials whom we have elec ted to execute
the principles of this document; and to the
I niversitv w hose polit ics most immediate
ly affect the climate in which we live.
If we lived in a community and institu
tional climate where women and minori
ties felt more sate and those with privilege
had our comfort challenged more often,
perhaps it would have been safe for
passershy to take the uncomfortable ac
tions needed to protect Kgerstrom's safety.
I he means to creating such a climate of
safety is not polit e presence in White I'la/a.
Such .111 action would not onl\ remove re
sponsibility tiir community safety from its
proper bearers, us. but also mistakenly
place the blame for the lack of safety on the
preacher and imply that his beliefs are out
of-tlie-ordinary. His words would not
carry such poyver if they weren't backed up
by a so-called president whose response
to the lynching of James Byrd was to op
pose hate crimes legislation. I hey would
not cam such power if Stanford provided
adequate resources to community centers,
including the Lesbian, Ciay, Bisexual and
Transgender (Community ('.enter, the only
administrative btxlv on this campus ex
