## Students not immune to problems of'normal' people 
### PETER STAIR GUEST COLUMNIST 
Assuming we live similarlv I <>
those in our parents' genera
tion: ( lhances are one in three
that we'll eat poorh enough
and live stresstulh enough that we'll sut
ler from roronan arter\ disease.
When we get married, tour out ot ten
times, we will come to find living with
our spouses so clitlu ult that we'll renege
on the lifetime commitment.
Its likelv we'll admit to leeling dissat
isfied In the amount we sleep each night.
On any given dav, there's a .'VI pereenl
ehance we will report th.it sleepiness is
interfering with regular at tivities.
We w ill probabh eat so much and ex
ercise so little that we'll earn an un
healthv amount ot bodv tat, probabh
gaining a pound a vear during the
decades after college. I wentv-seven per

cent ot us w ill be obese.
I here's a percent chance we w ill
report such frequent and deep "low
moods" that we will i|ualitv as depressed;
I 'J percent ot us will be clinically so.
When I hear about these maladies,
and then hear that they're mostly on the
rise, I think: "Wow. I'm sure glad I'm
above average."
1 think most people my age would also
consider themselves special, and that's
one ot the reasons these problems per
sist.
After all. who begins a marriage ex
pecting it to end in divorcer W ho ex
pects to slowl\ gain weight? And who
(booses a career anticipating disillu
sionment?
In the face ot rationality, most ot us
consider ourselves immune from t\pi(.il
problems. I his is especialh true .it Stan
ford, 1 think, where we tacitly convince
each other that we're smart enough to

consider health problems too basic lot
much attention.
Yet we've apparently ignored what we
have learned about healthy living in the
last few decades. Instead, old timers tell
me. Stanford students and professors are
living less moderately. We've increased
the pace of lite on c ampus, and. with it.
our discontent.
According to Alejandro Martine/. the
director of Stanford's Counseling and
Psychological Services, the number of
students suffering from severe psycho
logical disorders lias "increased greatlv"
in the 1 9905.
According to C.arole I'ertofskv, Clow
ell's director of health promotion, the
number of students repot ting anorexia,
bulimia, over-exercise and food obses
sion has risen. And student stress is no
tabh higher.
"It's reall\ different than it was," she
said.

Ihe folks from C.owell said iliat we
feel les> room tor failure, that we've sac
rificed personal exploration lor at .ident

the emotion.il UexibilitN skilU to cope
with new stresses.
" I'liere are unprecedented numbers
of students who are having trouble with
their roommates and house mates,"
Pertofskv said.
1 listen to her and others, and I don't

When 1 he.u people sa\ that Stanlord.

new direction, one that emphasi/es
human health: stabilitv. serenit\ and s.it
