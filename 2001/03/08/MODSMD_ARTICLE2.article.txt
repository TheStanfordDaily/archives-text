### BEN FRIEDMAN 
A group <>t Stanford re
searchers headed bv John Barn
may have discovered a new treat
ment tor depression, a pacemak
er foi the brain. Doctors now I>e
lieve that a device known .is the
vagus nene stimulate >r, previous
1\ used to tight epilepsy, could
help an estimated one million
Americans with depression that is
unresponsive to drug therapx.
" I he vagus nerve is some
times described .is a super
highwa\ into the brain, said
group co-direc tor Dr. ( harles
Deßattista.
Deßattista explained in a
March (> San |osc Mercun News
article that the pulses created In
the vagus nerve stimulator travel
through the bod\ to mam areas
of the brain, including the limbic
system, a region thought to have
.111 important role in regulating
emotion.
Researchci s uncovered tlie de
vice's additional benefits in l!K)8,
when epilepsv patients in .1 studv
reported mood improvements.
These reports triggered Cy-
Ijeronics, (lie Houston company
that manufactures the stimulator,
to launch a program to lest it on
30 patients with drug-resistant
depression.

After three months, accord
ing to results published in List
veai s Biological Psvchiatn jour
nal, about halt the patients
showed vast improvements on
two common standardized tests
used to evaluate depression.
Despite these lest results, doc
tors still do not tullv understand
how the vagus nerve stimulator
works, but the results will likelv
help researchers understand the
nature ot depression, said Dr.
John Batry, one ol'the overseeing
Stanford psvc hiatrists, in the San
Jose Mercury News article.
"One of the exciting things
about this is. once vou gel some
thing new that works, vou learn a
little more about the disease
\ou're treating," lie said. "I hope
it will allow us to understand
more about depression, and
mavbe even other diseases as
well."
Hie stimulator consists ot .in
Oreo oxikic-sized batten pack
and a thin w ire. Patients have the
device surgicalU implanted
under the collarbone, w ith a w ire
threaded up into the neck and
wrapped around the left vagus
nerve. The device sends out a 30-
second stream of impulses every
five minutes.
