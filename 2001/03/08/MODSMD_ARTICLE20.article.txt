# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Getting out of the house 
### ANDREW HINDERAKER GUEST COLUMNIST 
A friend ot mine was recently
accepted to the Stanford Pro
gram in Oxford. She asked
me it I would recommend it.
"Absolutely ." I told her, without hes
itation.
" But what about —
" |ust go," 1 repeated.
"but wait a minute. I heard that vou
onl\ hang out with Stanford kids in the
()\tord program, that vou don't experi
ence the culture."
Ah. \c's. 1 lie stuclv-abroad bubble. It
implies that students will nevei meet
anyone new, or that it's still Stanford.
11ist in another country. It's a m\th as
widely spread as the one about that
other bubble which apparently wraps
around our campus and lets no one
leave.
But it's a invth with some truth be
hind it. In my friend's defense, the pro
gram at Oxford is sheltered. Students
live solel\ wnli Stanford students; they
are your housemates, c lassmates and in
the eves of mam Brits, your onlv mates.
It is a doesn't have to be that way.
You can still "experience the culture."
even if you are enrolled iu a Stanford
program. You just have to do one thing,
and it is something nn mother always
told me to do: (let out ol the house.
I have many loncl memories of tnv
three-month sta\ in Kngland, and onlv
a few took place at the Stanford I louse.
I remember waiting outside for
stanclbv tic kets to "1 he l empest." at the
Roval Shakespeare Theatre in Strat
ford. \l\ friend and I fro/e that morn
ing — it couldn't have been mote than
40 degrees, with pouring rain and
"brat ing" winds. I remember wonder
ing what we were possibly thinking
when we woke up that morning, but it
was one ol the best shows I ve ever seen.
I remember the names of the pubs
we went to in London: (lock & Camel,
Rat X: Parrot, 112 leas & Pheasant. Basic al
ly. a pub was a safe bet as long as it had
a bird and a clirtv animal in its title.
I remember the one-ac t play 1 was in,
with three ()x!orcl students. It was a tei -
rible play with a terrible title: "Death-
Watch." There was a guv in it from

Manchester. 1 remember not being able
to understand him, because of bis ac
cent, and 1 had to take niv cues from
ver\ long pauses.
And then there was that cab driver,
Brine, in the Scottish Highlands. Me
had a little poem that he recited to each
customer: "Fields, vallevs, lochs and
glens 1 will take von there, m\
friends." I he poem, however, paled in
comparison to the tales he told. For in
stance, Bruce once entered a '20-mile
bike t at e. I le had nothing with him but
•i one-speed, a kilt and a pack of
(igarettes. I le, of course, won the rat e.
(•ranted. I ma\ not have been quite
as adventurous as I'm letting on. Some
tunes. I made these flips with mv Stan
lord liietuls. And there were nights
where 1 |ust decided to stav at the Stan
ford Mouse. Because of that, someone
might trv to tell me I didn't reallv "ex
perience the culture," whatever that
means. II that's true, then the Oxford
Program was the best experience I
never had.
()i c ourse, 1 had the advantage of an
Fnglish-speaking country. I here was
no language barrier that I had to over
come. Yet many of my friends have
been involved with the Stanford pro
grams in Paris, Florence or Santiago,
and they all seem to tell me the same
things. Yes, there is a comfort /one the
Stanford programs create. And vcs.
there can be an initial urge to remain
within that comfort /one, where you're
not intimidated In a different language
and culture.
But what's the fun in that?
1 guess I just don't understand it
when someone tells me that he doesn't
want to study abroad because he won't
really experience the culture. To me,
that's kind of like saying vou won't go to
Stanford, because you'll never see the
Bav Area. 1 he question in either case is
not whether the bubble exists; it does.
I he question is: What are vou going to
do about it? Because after all, San I ran
cisco can be a hell of a lot more exciting
on a Saturday night than the Row.

a bird and a clirtv animal in its title.
I remember the one-ac t play 1 was in,
with three ()x!orcl students. It was a tei -
rible play with a terrible title: "Death-
Watch." There was a guv in it from

Manchester. 1 remember not being able
to understand him, because of bis ac
cent, and 1 had to take niv cues from
ver\ long pauses.
And then there was that cab driver,
Brine, in the Scottish Highlands. Me
had a little poem that he recited to each
customer: "Fields, vallevs, lochs and
glens 1 will take von there, m\
friends." I he poem, however, paled in
comparison to the tales he told. For in
stance, Bruce once entered a '20-mile
bike t at e. I le had nothing with him but
•i one-speed, a kilt and a pack of
(igarettes. I le, of course, won the rat e.
(•ranted. I ma\ not have been quite
as adventurous as I'm letting on. Some
tunes. I made these flips with mv Stan
lord liietuls. And there were nights
where 1 |ust decided to stav at the Stan
ford Mouse. Because of that, someone
might trv to tell me I didn't reallv "ex
perience the culture," whatever that
means. II that's true, then the Oxford
Program was the best experience I
never had.
()i c ourse, 1 had the advantage of an
Fnglish-speaking country. I here was
no language barrier that I had to over
come. Yet many of my friends have
been involved with the Stanford pro
grams in Paris, Florence or Santiago,
and they all seem to tell me the same
things. Yes, there is a comfort /one the
Stanford programs create. And vcs.
there can be an initial urge to remain
within that comfort /one, where you're
not intimidated In a different language
and culture.
But what's the fun in that?
1 guess I just don't understand it
when someone tells me that he doesn't
want to study abroad because he won't
really experience the culture. To me,
that's kind of like saying vou won't go to
Stanford, because you'll never see the
Bav Area. 1 he question in either case is
not whether the bubble exists; it does.
I he question is: What are vou going to
do about it? Because after all, San I ran
cisco can be a hell of a lot more exciting
on a Saturday night than the Row.
()h, and so can Fngland.
