## Arizona, Woods come to Maples 
### TIM KANE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Okay, okay, so ihis next Stan
ford-Ari/ona lilt isn't going to have
the same tenor and intensity that
marked January's game. Or either
of last year's games. Or ... von get
the idea.
B\ winning at UCLA last Satur
day and clinching a tie tot the Pat it
it 10 Conference championship,
the Cardinal took most ot the sig
nificance out of tonight's matc hup,
though the No. 7 Wildcats might
disagree with that assessment.
Coach Lute Olson and his squad
could use another marquee win to
lock in a No. 2 seed for the upcom
ing NCAA Tournament, while ex
acting some revenge tor Stanford's
85-76 win earlier this year.
Don't expect the No. 1 Cardinal
to go on cruise control tor this one,
though. In Pauley Pavilion last
week, sophomore guard Case\ |a
cobsen swore his team would not
suffer a letdown against Arizona,
despite the fact that nothing is real
ly on the line-, as a win ovei lowlv
Arizona State on Saturdav will
clinch the title, too.
Wonder where lie got that idea
from?
"1 sure didn't feel am less pres
sure when I woke up Monday
knowing that we have games

against Arizona and Ai izona State."
Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomen said. "If we had It>st to
I ( I A. we might have to share the
Pac-10 title. So of com se we want to
come out against Arizona and
clinch it on night, it it is
possible."
Montgomen isn't being overh
cautious. The W ildcats ( 21-7, l.S-3
Pac-10) aren't exacth a team that
will roll ovei and die tor you. par
ticularly when the\ ve got a chip on
their collectiye shouldei dating
back to Januan 's loss to the ( ardi
nal (27-1, 15-1). And when the\
play together, the results often
aren't pretty lor the other team.
Just ask C)regon and I S(both ol
whom suffered 40-plus-point losse s
to Arizona m (lie last month.
"[The game] w ill be a huge chal
lenge for us," ()lson said. "But it is
not the first time we have gone in
[Maples Pavilion] and played Stan
ford when ilie\ are ranked No. 1
(lertainlv, we have great respec t f< >i
them, but we are not in awe of
where they are. We know it will take
our best effort, but it will also t.ike
pretty close to their best eflort."

B\ winning at UCLA last Satur
day and clinching a tie tot the Pat it
it 10 Conference championship,
the Cardinal took most ot the sig
nificance out of tonight's matc hup,
though the No. 7 Wildcats might
disagree with that assessment.
Coach Lute Olson and his squad
could use another marquee win to
lock in a No. 2 seed for the upcom
ing NCAA Tournament, while ex
acting some revenge tor Stanford's
85-76 win earlier this year.
Don't expect the No. 1 Cardinal
to go on cruise control tor this one,
though. In Pauley Pavilion last
week, sophomore guard Case\ |a
cobsen swore his team would not
suffer a letdown against Arizona,
despite the fact that nothing is real
ly on the line-, as a win ovei lowlv
Arizona State on Saturdav will
clinch the title, too.
Wonder where lie got that idea
from?
"1 sure didn't feel am less pres
sure when I woke up Monday
knowing that we have games

against Arizona and Ai izona State."
Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomen said. "If we had It>st to
I ( I A. we might have to share the
Pac-10 title. So of com se we want to
come out against Arizona and
clinch it on night, it it is
possible."
Montgomen isn't being overh
cautious. The W ildcats ( 21-7, l.S-3
Pac-10) aren't exacth a team that
will roll ovei and die tor you. par
ticularly when the\ ve got a chip on
their collectiye shouldei dating
back to Januan 's loss to the ( ardi
nal (27-1, 15-1). And when the\
play together, the results often
aren't pretty lor the other team.
Just ask C)regon and I S(both ol
whom suffered 40-plus-point losse s
to Arizona m (lie last month.
