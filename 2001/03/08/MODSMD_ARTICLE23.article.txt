hasn't been m this position in a
longtime. In the last 14 years, the
question hasn't been whether the
Cardinal will make the NCAA
Tournament, but rather how far
it will go once it gets there.
With two regular-season con
ference games remaining and
only 1 (i wins to its name, the Stan
lord women's basketball team
(16-10, 10-6 Pacific 10 Confer

fight this weekend to impress the
selection committee and land it
self a tournament seed.
"1 hope we play well," Van-
Derveer said. "Our season is on
the line, and we have to respond."
With games on the road
against tough conference oppo

Stanford has more than .i simple
task ahead of them.
Tonight, the Cardinal meets
the Wildcats, a team .ilso on the
tournament bubble. While Ari

some exclamation points on its

Arizona is led by senior
Reshea Bristol, whose smother
ing defense and calculated ball
control add experience and
poise to an otherwise voung
team. Bristol leads the Pac-10 in
assists, but is .ilso capable of pro

the perimeter.
Complimenting the play ol

Arizona State (19-9, 11-")), the
