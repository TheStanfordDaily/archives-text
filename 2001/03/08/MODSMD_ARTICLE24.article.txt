### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
So, what exactlv does head base
ball coach Mark Marquess moan
when lu- savs "timeh hilling wins
baseball games"?
Ask ( In is (VRiordan.
The junior second baseman
blasted a solo home run 111 the bot
tom ot the 10th inning last night to
give the No. 10 (lardiual (1 ~>-f)) .t 3-
2 victorv oxer California (10-6),
giving Stanford its 12th (onset li
the series victorv dating back to
last season.
And talk about timeh hitting.
I he ( ardinal had its hack to the
wall, fining the potential of losing
its first series to Cal since 1991V
Furthermore, O'Riordan had
been struggling at the plate in the
series, having gone 1 -for-12 before
he came to the plate in the 1 Ot I i in
ning. He had also been unable to
drive in runs with two men on base
in the bottom oft he seventh inning
to break the 2-2 tie, grounding into
a double plav.
"1 was pumped up when I hit it
out, and I was a little relieved to get
the monkev oil niv back," said
O'Riordan, whose game-winning
home run gave him his team-lead
ing RBI of the season.
Fhe win could not have come at

a better time for the Cardinal,
which lias fought the frustration of
leaving runners in scoring position
for the past two games. Stanford
left It) runners on base in Satur
days 3-2 loss, and left six more in
last night's contest.
O'Riordan s solo shot also pre
vented C ,il from putting a damper
on a welcome-back part\ of sorts
tor junior pitcher Mike Cosling.
Costing, who had been absent
since the first game ol the season
because of ail arm injurv, started
the gainc- for the Cardinal. Mar
quess was onl\ testing Costing's
arm, keeping the left-hander on a
strict pitch count of 30 and allow
ing him to pit( h only two innings.
But what a solid two innings
they were.
The 1 ,(>4O fans at Sunken Dia
mond were finallv able to gel a
quick, but impressive, glimpse of
what the preseason second-team
All-American pitcher is capable of
oil the mound. After allowing his
onh hit to Cal s leadott batter Ben
Conlev, Cosling retired six out of

MATT SAYLES/ I he Stanford Daily File
The pitching staff came up huge for the No 10 Cardinal in yesterday's 3-2,
1 Oth-inning victory over California at Sunken Diamond
So, what exactlv does head base
ball coach Mark Marquess moan
when lu- savs "timeh hilling wins
baseball games"?
Ask ( In is (VRiordan.
The junior second baseman
blasted a solo home run 111 the bot
tom ot the 10th inning last night to
give the No. 10 (lardiual (1 ~>-f)) .t 3-
2 victorv oxer California (10-6),
giving Stanford its 12th (onset li
the series victorv dating back to
last season.
And talk about timeh hitting.
I he ( ardinal had its hack to the
wall, fining the potential of losing
its first series to Cal since 1991V
Furthermore, O'Riordan had
been struggling at the plate in the
series, having gone 1 -for-12 before
he came to the plate in the 1 Ot I i in
ning. He had also been unable to
drive in runs with two men on base
in the bottom oft he seventh inning
to break the 2-2 tie, grounding into
a double plav.
"1 was pumped up when I hit it
out, and I was a little relieved to get
the monkev oil niv back," said
O'Riordan, whose game-winning
home run gave him his team-lead
ing RBI of the season.
Fhe win could not have come at

a better time for the Cardinal,
which lias fought the frustration of
leaving runners in scoring position
for the past two games. Stanford
left It) runners on base in Satur
days 3-2 loss, and left six more in
last night's contest.
O'Riordan s solo shot also pre
vented C ,il from putting a damper
on a welcome-back part\ of sorts
tor junior pitcher Mike Cosling.
Costing, who had been absent
since the first game ol the season
because of ail arm injurv, started
the gainc- for the Cardinal. Mar
quess was onl\ testing Costing's
arm, keeping the left-hander on a
strict pitch count of 30 and allow
ing him to pit( h only two innings.
But what a solid two innings
they were.
The 1 ,(>4O fans at Sunken Dia
mond were finallv able to gel a
quick, but impressive, glimpse of
what the preseason second-team
All-American pitcher is capable of
oil the mound. After allowing his
onh hit to Cal s leadott batter Ben
Conlev, Cosling retired six out of
the next seven batters with four
strikeouts.
