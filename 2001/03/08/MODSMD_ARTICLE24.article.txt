So, what exactlv does head base
ball coach Mark Marquess moan
when lu- savs "timeh hilling wins
baseball games"?
Ask ( In is (VRiordan.
The junior second baseman
blasted a solo home run 111 the bot
tom ot the 10th inning last night to
give the No. 10 (lardiual (1 ~>-f)) .t 3-
2 victorv oxer California (10-6),
giving Stanford its 12th (onset li
the series victorv dating back to
last season.
And talk about timeh hitting.
I he ( ardinal had its hack to the
wall, fining the potential of losing
its first series to Cal since 1991V
Furthermore, O'Riordan had
been struggling at the plate in the

Costing, who had been absent
since the first game ol the season
because of ail arm injurv, started
the gainc- for the Cardinal. Mar
quess was onl\ testing Costing's
arm, keeping the left-hander on a
strict pitch count of 30 and allow
ing him to pit( h only two innings.
But what a solid two innings
they were.
The 1 ,(>4O fans at Sunken Dia
mond were finallv able to gel a
quick, but impressive, glimpse of
what the preseason second-team
All-American pitcher is capable of
oil the mound. After allowing his
onh hit to Cal s leadott batter Ben
Conlev, Cosling retired six out of
the next seven batters with four
strikeouts.
I sing a blend of breaking balls,
