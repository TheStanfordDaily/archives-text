# Women hope to extend streak
## Top-ranked women’s water polo takes its 11-match winning streak on the road this weekend against Cal and Pacific 
### KIMBERLY ROBERTS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Any time Stanford plays (lalifornia, it is a big game. I low
ever, tins Saturday, the Cardinal women's water polo team
(11-0, 1-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) travels

across the Bay to face the No. 1 Golden Bears (5-5, 0-1
MPSF) in what promises to be an especialh heated match.
The Cardinal, undefeated on the season and ranked No.
1 nationally, will put its unblemished record on the line as it
goes for win No. 12.
While undefeated records are often downplayed on the
basis ot strength of schedule, five of the Cardinal's 1 1 wins
have come against teams ranked in the top four nationally.
1 his includes a resounding 8-3 victorv over Cal earlier this
season.
In tomorrow's match, the Golden Bears will not only
look to avenge this earlier loss to the Cardinal, thev will also
be rebounding from last weekend's tough defeat at the
hands of No. 2 UCLA. 1 his was an especialh hard loss for
Cal; the Golden Bears led, 5-3, late in the- third quarter be
fore allowing four unanswered goals and losing, 7-5.
While the Cardinal defeated the Golden Bears handilv
the first time the two teams met. this match could prove to
be much tighter.
"Cal is playing better than thev were at the beginning of
the season. " said head coach |ohn fanner. "Since then,
the\ ve improved a lot and now have seven or eight people
scoring effectively. Thev have .t lot more weapons, so we'll
not onl\ have to plav good one-on-one defense but also
good team defense."
I lie Golden Bears equal the Cardinal in that thev also
feature two members of the 2000 I'.S. Olympic team:
freshman Krika Forenz, who was the voungest member of
the national team, and senior Heather Petri. Other top re
turners tor Cal are senior driver Beth Irwin and senior
goalkeeper Kana Fuqua, who was last year's MPSF Goal
keeper of the Year.
"[Cal is| an all around great team." said Stanford fresh
man Blind.i Villa, another Olympian. " 1 lie first time we
played them, they didn't seem to have found their groove
or come together as a team. Thev have a lot of potential to
click at an\ time."
Adding to I lie significance of the match is its effect on
postseason play for both squads. A win against C.il nia\ \e
Stanford .i higher seed in the conference tournament and,
therefore, iiu tease the team's i ham es of making the \( V\
tournament.
"We won't change anything about what we do tot this
match," Fanner said. "The) plav a drop defense, which will
make lis have to score more from the perimeter, and they
also have a great goalie. We'll need to do a better job ot .it
tacking from different places in our offense, having a more
balanced attack and being more multi-dimensional."
Flic squad will also be gunning for lucky win No. 13
against the I diversity of the Pacific on Sunday. While Pa
cific is imicinked and 2-8 on the year, the match is signifi
cant because it is another M PSF mate hup.
"Filtering the match, 1 know we'll be confident, but, at
the same time, we'll be mentalh and physic ally prepared,"
Villa said. "We enter evei \ game the same wa\. whether our
opponent is ranked No. 2 or not ranked .u all."
Both matches are scheduled for 12:00 p.m.
