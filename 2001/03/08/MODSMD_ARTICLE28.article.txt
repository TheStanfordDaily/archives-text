### 
Picked-up pieces left over from m\
pre-spring-cleaning cleaning . . .
• What the women's basketball
team has done this season is just
shocking, reminiscent ot the St. Louis
Rams' thrashing of the Atlanta Falcons
without a kicker earlier this year. After
Jamie Carey's tragic retirement and Susan
"Carey 11: The New Batch" King's season
ending ACL injury, which left the Cardi-

nal without a point
guard on the roster, it's
still hanging onto an
NCAA bid bv its finger
nails at 16-10. Look for
Tyrone Willingham to
imitate coach Lara Van-
Dervcer's strategy In
starting kern («u ter .it
QB next season.
•I'm a longtime

Teeniu Selanne fan, and 1 couldn't be
happier with the trade that brought him
to the San jose Sharks. I wo things worn
me about the move, though. First, what
can we do to stop the overflow of terrible
puns on the words "Shark" and "Finn"?
And, second, how fast will the founding
members of, say, the Canadiens be spin
ning in their graves if the Stanley Cup
ends up in Northern California?
• II 1 was from .mother country and
vou told me that one ol the hottest topics
in organized athletics right now was the
trade of David "Shainu" Wells lot Mike
"1 lev. One Ann Out C )l Two Ain't Bad!"
Su (>tk.t, I would have to raise some serious
questions as to exacth how "athletic" was
defined.
• Another year, another women's ten
nis title. Ho-luun. Hey, win don't you
gins tr\ plaving It-It\ or something? Cive
'em a chance.
• Although the "Shoot for Seed ('.api
tal" promotion at men's basketball games
is fun, it could be immensely improved
and get some much-needed public ity to an
underpronioted sport with a few tweaks.
Imagine, il you will, "Fencing for Seed
Capital," in which two middle-aged Bav
Area residents square off with sword and

dagger .11 li.ilti inic to the death, or at least
to first blood. Winner gets the losei s liqui
dated holdings and a comelv lass ol virtue
true. Yarr.
• Also, instead ot having children hus
tling to put on Jason and Jarron's uni
tbrms in the Cardinal Kid's C.luh basket
hall promotion, why not just have
midgets? I hat'd get the alumni on their
feet, I bet.
• No sporting event is mot e over-cov
ered, over-blown and over-anal\ /ed than
baseball spring training. It's all the ex
hausting analvsis and mind-numbing sta
tistical debate without am ot the actual
winning or losing. Ihe details ot how
Mike Lansing responds to the new high
strike-zone is not something that inter
ests me.
• Sad spring training news from Ori
oles' t amp, however. Albert Belle appears
to have Hipped otf his last fan. Hut all is
not vet lost. As a man who hates the pub
lit eve, Belle mav vet have plaving days
available in lower profile sports more to
his liking. Sa\. competition darts. ()t lum

mav not be the man to provide with a
diesel-powered chainsaw, perhaps he
might pla\ out his career at the Westmin
ster Dog Show. C'.ooperstown is just
around the corner.
• No. 1 sign that von may be in the
wrong line of work: when you are the
reigning Super Bowl-winning quarter
back, and your team's signing of Klvis
(Irbac instanth results in evervone calling
vou "the backup." When Klvis (irbac is
voin starter, and there's not a quarterback
controversy, the second- and third
stringers probabh have grounds to sue tor
violation of their (ivil i ights.
• Stanford men's basketball NC.AA
tickets are available through an online lot
tery system in which you can specify a
"buddy." If vou or your buddy is selected
in the lottery, you both automatically re
ceive tickets.
Frankly, 1 am dismayed at this terrible

• Although the "Shoot for Seed ('.api
tal" promotion at men's basketball games
is fun, it could be immensely improved
and get some much-needed public ity to an
underpronioted sport with a few tweaks.
Imagine, il you will, "Fencing for Seed
Capital," in which two middle-aged Bav
Area residents square off with sword and

dagger .11 li.ilti inic to the death, or at least
to first blood. Winner gets the losei s liqui

baseball spring training. It's all the ex

• No. 1 sign that von may be in the
wrong line of work: when you are the
reigning Super Bowl-winning quarter
back, and your team's signing of Klvis
