When you order erotic materi
als in the mail. thev ahvays come in
discreet, inconspicuous brown
paper wrapping. (So I he.tr.) I hap
pened to get one ol these pat kages
last week, but it was from inv edi
tor I he contents? Screening tapes
lor the upcoming Asian American
Film Festival to be held in San
Francisco starting toda\.
I should have figured something
about this assignment would be
rat v. You see, mv spide\ sense hatl
,ilread\ been acting up that dav: For
some reason, when I went to go pit k
up the tapes at The Daily ollice
(stored in an inconspicuous brown
paper bag), I It-It the need to sneak
around the plat e like the t loset pot n
liend th.it gu\ down the hall has al
wa\ s suspected that I am. (Whoops,
there goes m\ tover.)
()k.iv. let's rewind. I.et me just
s.iv that this is not at all the kind of
thing I thought I'd be wriling about.
I mean — come on — this is a pres
tigious Ii111) festival that touts itsell .is
"the largest event in North America
dedicated to the exhibition ol Asian
Vmeritan and Asian film." As an
Asian aspiring journalist engineer
movie director Asian pride coordi
nator, I was excited about this event
.ind felt like I had a responsibility to
get other people fired up about it as
well.
Most of the material I had been
given to work with, though, was ex
trenielv sketchv. Mv editor snagged
me preview tapes for four night's
worth of programming, a stagger
ing amount of which turned out to
be needlessly pornographic (Wait
what did I pist say?).
The end result of all mv Asian-
American movie watching was that
I sincerely lea ret 1 for Asian repre
sentation in film today. II the films
I've seen are a good representa
tion of the festival, then we're in a
little bit of trouble. Yes, I did wit
ness some moving moments and
some flashy camera moves, but for
even excellent short film of the
"()ina Rhee" variety, I'm terrified
that there will be 10 " Play ing With
Ourselves" equivalents to chal
lenge it.
You'll see what 1 mean. In the
meantime, though, everyone in
terested in expanding their hori
zons should still take the opportu
nity to check this festival out. Fak
ing a chance on an independent
film isn't always rewarding, but
that just makes the gems von find
all the more noteworthv. Besides.
I'd take avant-garde kitsch over

Hollvwood confortnism any d.»\,
and I do concede that 1 might not
be hip enough to todav's modern
art to appreciate everything I
screened.
"Grrrls, Uninterrupted"
Saturday, March 10, at 7:15 p.m.
1 appreciate the thoughts that
must have been going through m\
editor's head when she picked out
the tape for this. Sounds st andalous.
her conscience must have said to
her. Just the kind of thing Intermis
sion is all about.
I thought so. too, and "(arris
I ninten upted" certainly didn't dis
appoint me. It didn't dawn on me
until several shorts into the program
that a startling number of the pieces
here dealt with homosexuality in
some foi m oi another.
Nearly all ol them did, in fact.
Now. don't get me wrong: I've got
nothing to sax about homosexuality
as a whole. Hie only thing that real
ly disturbed me here was the quality
of the programming. Quite Iranklv,
I was either bored or horribly of
fended. Flic pieces ranged from
mosth harmless (Jean |oson's "Re
union" and Wentb Fong's 'Artilii ial
Intimacy") to kmk\ (Yvette C,hoy's
blackmail Material") to downright
dirt\ and explicit (C.hingari (.hum
ma and Angela Leonino's "Fatly
Sunbeam" and theaptlv titled "l'lav
ing With ()urselves").
Tin still not sure what to think; the

program as a whole hardly seemed
poignant or cohesive, fust what is
there to understand when we're pre
sented with senseless, grainy images ol
masturbating women in "Playing With
Ourselves," with men playing out a
male rape fantasy under the guise ola
t amp sentlup to I lititlt films in "('.hin
gari Chumma" or the protracted tiiis
en-scene of two women locked in con
tinuous kissing for the entire length ol
"For Amhramovit Love ('.octeau"?
"Artificial Intimacy" is one of the lew
shorts in the festival that attempts to ad
dress a broader issue namely, Chat
rooms and the lalsitv of today's commu
nication and cylier-relationships. ITie.
press release lor each of these piet es
makes its material seem like a true
work of art, with a thesis that tat kles
epic social themes. In most cases, n is
a strett h. a big stretch.
All in all. "(il ll is I ninterrupt
ed" is an ambiguous representa
tion ol Asian America — as well as
homosexuality — and probably
not worth your time.

"The Cut Runs Deep"
Friday, March 9, at 7:00 p.m..
Monday, March 12, at 9:00 p.m.
"The (lut Runs Deep" is the
only true "movie" of the festival
that I was able to view, shot on
nun film and running well into fea
ture length. It is about a half-1 Bul
garian, half-Korean guv named
Ben who works as the deliverv boy
lot a small Chinese restaurant in
New York. ()ne day. while making a
routine deliverv, Ben shares a mo
ment with a mvsterious m.in named
J.1)., a man who Ben somehow un
mediatelv senses is the leader ola
Korean street gang tli.it i im>. ram
pant through the Bit; Apple.
Kventuallv, Ben comes to l>e a mem
ber of tins gang beginning his descent
into underworld acti\ ities and those age
old vices of power, mone\ and women.
ft» sum it up. it is the Korean-American
version of "Goodfellas."
I bis work was the most pol
ished of .ill the pieces 1 saw, and for
a good reason. I'he director. |ohn
If. Lee, is a recent graduate of the
prestigious New York I tiiversitv
lilm program.
I nfortunatelv, the brilliant at t
ing .nut directing couldn't bide the
fact that the film lits so convenient!)
into the label I've already men
tioned. It really is a knock-off of
"Goodlellas." I here is even a brash
Joe IVsci-like character to get on
your nerves. 1 don't know il such
Korean mobs really do exist in New
York, but it would be troubling to
think that Lee didn't know lie was
hlatantlv ripping oil Scorsese, also
an NYI graduate.
And like all di anias of this Ivpe. it
starts to lose steam in the last third ol
the movie as the characters become
mired in the situations they've creat
ed for themselves. Yet, even il most
of the storyline can't be attributed to
Lee. this is a director who's work I
definitely look forward to seeing
more of.
"The Cut Runs Deep" isn't a feel
good movie, but it is worth a look, and
it gives you hope that there are Asian
Americans who have the potential to
join the ranks of the elite Hollywood
cognoscenti.
"I.K.U
Screening: Monday, March 12, at
9:4*> p.m.
Hmm . . . where to begin. This
movie from Japan started out inno
cently enough: A cool prologue in
formed me that it is the 21st century
and a cotnpam named tlie Genome
Corporation has provided the world
with a sexual revolution in the form ol
1.K.1 . c(xlers, sexual roljots of some
sort. Oka\, a bit kinkv, but edgy and
interesting in that amine kind of way.
Within minutes, however, the
lilm launches into what turns out
to be little more than one huge, or
giastic session of hardcore pornog
raphy. Virtual pornography, that
is. combining live action with a
di/zving arrav of special effects, the

culmination ol which is a comput
er-generated phallus writhing and
twirling around in a nebulous re
gion that need not be specified. II
that doesn't offend you, "Fk.l is
happy to accommodate: Nearly
every sexual situation imaginable is
portrayed here in some way or an
other. and, yes, it is explicit.
I say this not to entice you, dear
reader, but to give you a sense of
what I went through dut tug this en
tire 70-mitiute opus, begging for
some sort ol story development, be
lieve it oi not, there is such a thing as
ttx) much sex in a movie. Once
again, I was tli iven to fall hack on the
press release to make sense of
things. "Fk.l is being marketed
as a sci-li porn based on the cult das
si(, "Blade Runner."
I he press release also claims that
there is a storv involved, but it will be
.i cold da\ m hell befoi e I go bat k to
look for it. I don't feel qualified to
judge this movie on its merits as a
porno, but. as an entry in the film
festival (and a representation ol
Asian-America), I found n incom
prehensible and unbelievably ollen
stve. Folks, il you y alue voin sense ol
decency, steer clear. As lor me, I
figure I'm beyond saving now.
"Secret Sounds"
Screening: Wednesday. March If,
at 9:00 p.m.
Probably the most poignant
program I was able to \ iex\, "Se
cret Sounds" is a collection of
shorts that best approximates
thctvpeofniateri.il I yvas expect
ing to encounter when I Fust
took tins assignment.
Fhe program begins with "In
stitute Pavlova." an inconsequen
tial animated piet e, and moves on
to "Turk Street," a look at a
"Third-World" section ol San
Francisco. I he program begins to

hit its stride with the short "Secret
Sounds," an interesting if incredi
bly simple storv of the revelation of
one ('.hinese family's intricate fam
ily secrets and aflaii s.

"Oma Rhee" is out' ol the most
compelling shorts. Made In Har
vard documentan film graduate
Ros\ l\ m Rhee, the piece presents a
montage of family pictures while
we listen to testimony ol the au
thor's siblings describing their
mother and the circumstances sur
rounding her suicide.
"Seven I lours to Burn" is an ex
ploration <>l author Shanti
1 hakur's iamih history, docu
menting the historical events sur
rounding the lives ol hi t Danish
mother and Indian father. Ihe
program closes with Richard
Fling's "Sea in the Blood, which
documents Fung's lifelong rela
tionship with famih illness, first m
that ol his doomed sister (who lived

t<> age 29) .iikl latet in his \II)S
siri( ken partnet • I mi.
In ni\ mind, "Oni.t Rliec" and
Sea in the Blood art" two ol die
most moving pieces ol art I've seen
in quite some time. Hirough the
simple retelling ol the ti.iiimatu
events ol their lives, the two autliot s
ol these shorts succeed in demon
strating the true powei ol the medi
um. We sense that they've experi
eiK ed both a catharsis and .1 pride in
putting their stories to permanent
images and sound. N\ committing
their torment to a medium which
others can experience, they 111 turn
are able to make sense ol the chaos

and reconcile themselves with the
course of life.
For these reasons alone, il nothing
else. "Set ret Sounds" i> worth the price
of admission.

"The Cut Runs Deep"
Friday, March 9, at 7:00 p.m..
Monday, March 12, at 9:00 p.m.
"The (lut Runs Deep" is the
only true "movie" of the festival
that I was able to view, shot on
nun film and running well into fea
ture length. It is about a half-1 Bul
garian, half-Korean guv named
Ben who works as the deliverv boy
lot a small Chinese restaurant in
New York. ()ne day. while making a
routine deliverv, Ben shares a mo
ment with a mvsterious m.in named
J.1)., a man who Ben somehow un
mediatelv senses is the leader ola
Korean street gang tli.it i im>. ram
pant through the Bit; Apple.
Kventuallv, Ben comes to l>e a mem
ber of tins gang beginning his descent
into underworld acti\ ities and those age
old vices of power, mone\ and women.
ft» sum it up. it is the Korean-American
version of "Goodfellas."
I bis work was the most pol
ished of .ill the pieces 1 saw, and for
a good reason. I'he director. |ohn
If. Lee, is a recent graduate of the
prestigious New York I tiiversitv
lilm program.
I nfortunatelv, the brilliant at t
ing .nut directing couldn't bide the
fact that the film lits so convenient!)
into the label I've already men
tioned. It really is a knock-off of
"Goodlellas." I here is even a brash
Joe IVsci-like character to get on
your nerves. 1 don't know il such
Korean mobs really do exist in New
York, but it would be troubling to
think that Lee didn't know lie was
hlatantlv ripping oil Scorsese, also
an NYI graduate.
And like all di anias of this Ivpe. it
starts to lose steam in the last third ol
the movie as the characters become
mired in the situations they've creat
ed for themselves. Yet, even il most
of the storyline can't be attributed to
Lee. this is a director who's work I
definitely look forward to seeing
more of.
"The Cut Runs Deep" isn't a feel
good movie, but it is worth a look, and
it gives you hope that there are Asian
Americans who have the potential to
join the ranks of the elite Hollywood
cognoscenti.
"I.K.U
Screening: Monday, March 12, at
9:4*> p.m.
Hmm . . . where to begin. This
movie from Japan started out inno
cently enough: A cool prologue in

and a cotnpam named tlie Genome

Within minutes, however, the

to be little more than one huge, or
giastic session of hardcore pornog

"Secret Sounds"
Screening: Wednesday. March If,
at 9:00 p.m.
Probably the most poignant
program I was able to \ iex\, "Se
cret Sounds" is a collection of
shorts that best approximates
thctvpeofniateri.il I yvas expect

took tins assignment.
Fhe program begins with "In

tial animated piet e, and moves on
to "Turk Street," a look at a
"Third-World" section ol San

hit its stride with the short "Secret

bly simple storv of the revelation of
one ('.hinese family's intricate fam
ily secrets and aflaii s.

"Oma Rhee" is out' ol the most
compelling shorts. Made In Har
vard documentan film graduate
Ros\ l\ m Rhee, the piece presents a
montage of family pictures while
we listen to testimony ol the au

mother and the circumstances sur
rounding her suicide.
"Seven I lours to Burn" is an ex

program closes with Richard

that ol his doomed sister (who lived

t<> age 29) .iikl latet in his \II)S

In ni\ mind, "Oni.t Rliec" and
Sea in the Blood art" two ol die
most moving pieces ol art I've seen
in quite some time. Hirough the
simple retelling ol the ti.iiimatu
events ol their lives, the two autliot s
ol these shorts succeed in demon

putting their stories to permanent
images and sound. N\ committing
their torment to a medium which

are able to make sense ol the chaos

and reconcile themselves with the

For these reasons alone, il nothing

I should have figured something

around the plat e like the t loset pot n
liend th.it gu\ down the hall has al

there goes m\ tover.)
()k.iv. let's rewind. I.et me just
s.iv that this is not at all the kind of
thing I thought I'd be wriling about.
I mean — come on — this is a pres
tigious Ii111) festival that touts itsell .is
"the largest event in North America
dedicated to the exhibition ol Asian
Vmeritan and Asian film." As an
Asian aspiring journalist engineer
movie director Asian pride coordi
nator, I was excited about this event
.ind felt like I had a responsibility to
get other people fired up about it as
well.
Most of the material I had been
given to work with, though, was ex
trenielv sketchv. Mv editor snagged
me preview tapes for four night's
worth of programming, a stagger
ing amount of which turned out to
be needlessly pornographic (Wait
what did I pist say?).
The end result of all mv Asian-
American movie watching was that
I sincerely lea ret 1 for Asian repre
sentation in film today. II the films
I've seen are a good representa
tion of the festival, then we're in a
little bit of trouble. Yes, I did wit
ness some moving moments and
some flashy camera moves, but for
even excellent short film of the
"()ina Rhee" variety, I'm terrified
that there will be 10 " Play ing With
Ourselves" equivalents to chal
lenge it.
You'll see what 1 mean. In the
meantime, though, everyone in
terested in expanding their hori
zons should still take the opportu
nity to check this festival out. Fak
ing a chance on an independent
film isn't always rewarding, but
that just makes the gems von find
all the more noteworthv. Besides.
I'd take avant-garde kitsch over

Hollvwood confortnism any d.»\,
and I do concede that 1 might not
be hip enough to todav's modern
art to appreciate everything I
screened.
"Grrrls, Uninterrupted"
Saturday, March 10, at 7:15 p.m.
1 appreciate the thoughts that
must have been going through m\
editor's head when she picked out
the tape for this. Sounds st andalous.
her conscience must have said to
her. Just the kind of thing Intermis
sion is all about.
I thought so. too, and "(arris
I ninten upted" certainly didn't dis
appoint me. It didn't dawn on me
until several shorts into the program
that a startling number of the pieces
here dealt with homosexuality in
some foi m oi another.
Nearly all ol them did, in fact.
Now. don't get me wrong: I've got
nothing to sax about homosexuality
as a whole. Hie only thing that real
ly disturbed me here was the quality
of the programming. Quite Iranklv,
I was either bored or horribly of
fended. Flic pieces ranged from
mosth harmless (Jean |oson's "Re
union" and Wentb Fong's 'Artilii ial
Intimacy") to kmk\ (Yvette C,hoy's
blackmail Material") to downright
dirt\ and explicit (C.hingari (.hum
ma and Angela Leonino's "Fatly
Sunbeam" and theaptlv titled "l'lav
ing With ()urselves").
Tin still not sure what to think; the

program as a whole hardly seemed
poignant or cohesive, fust what is
there to understand when we're pre
sented with senseless, grainy images ol
masturbating women in "Playing With
Ourselves," with men playing out a
male rape fantasy under the guise ola
t amp sentlup to I lititlt films in "('.hin
gari Chumma" or the protracted tiiis
en-scene of two women locked in con
tinuous kissing for the entire length ol
"For Amhramovit Love ('.octeau"?
"Artificial Intimacy" is one of the lew
shorts in the festival that attempts to ad
dress a broader issue namely, Chat
rooms and the lalsitv of today's commu
nication and cylier-relationships. ITie.
press release lor each of these piet es
makes its material seem like a true
work of art, with a thesis that tat kles
epic social themes. In most cases, n is
a strett h. a big stretch.
All in all. "(il ll is I ninterrupt

When you order erotic materi

discreet, inconspicuous brown
paper wrapping. (So I he.tr.) I hap
pened to get one ol these pat kages
last week, but it was from inv edi
tor I he contents? Screening tapes
lor the upcoming Asian American
Film Festival to be held in San
Francisco starting toda\.
I should have figured something
about this assignment would be
rat v. You see, mv spide\ sense hatl
,ilread\ been acting up that dav: For
some reason, when I went to go pit k
up the tapes at The Daily ollice
(stored in an inconspicuous brown
paper bag), I It-It the need to sneak
around the plat e like the t loset pot n
liend th.it gu\ down the hall has al
wa\ s suspected that I am. (Whoops,
there goes m\ tover.)
()k.iv. let's rewind. I.et me just
s.iv that this is not at all the kind of
thing I thought I'd be wriling about.
I mean — come on — this is a pres
tigious Ii111) festival that touts itsell .is
"the largest event in North America
dedicated to the exhibition ol Asian
Vmeritan and Asian film." As an
Asian aspiring journalist engineer
movie director Asian pride coordi
nator, I was excited about this event
.ind felt like I had a responsibility to
get other people fired up about it as
well.
Most of the material I had been
given to work with, though, was ex
trenielv sketchv. Mv editor snagged
me preview tapes for four night's
worth of programming, a stagger
ing amount of which turned out to
be needlessly pornographic (Wait
what did I pist say?).
The end result of all mv Asian-
American movie watching was that
I sincerely lea ret 1 for Asian repre
sentation in film today. II the films
I've seen are a good representa
tion of the festival, then we're in a
little bit of trouble. Yes, I did wit
ness some moving moments and
some flashy camera moves, but for
even excellent short film of the
"()ina Rhee" variety, I'm terrified
that there will be 10 " Play ing With
Ourselves" equivalents to chal
lenge it.
You'll see what 1 mean. In the
meantime, though, everyone in
terested in expanding their hori
zons should still take the opportu
nity to check this festival out. Fak
ing a chance on an independent
film isn't always rewarding, but
that just makes the gems von find
all the more noteworthv. Besides.
I'd take avant-garde kitsch over

Hollvwood confortnism any d.»\,
and I do concede that 1 might not
be hip enough to todav's modern
art to appreciate everything I
screened.
"Grrrls, Uninterrupted"
Saturday, March 10, at 7:15 p.m.
1 appreciate the thoughts that
must have been going through m\
editor's head when she picked out
the tape for this. Sounds st andalous.
her conscience must have said to
her. Just the kind of thing Intermis
sion is all about.
I thought so. too, and "(arris
I ninten upted" certainly didn't dis
appoint me. It didn't dawn on me
until several shorts into the program
that a startling number of the pieces
here dealt with homosexuality in
some foi m oi another.
Nearly all ol them did, in fact.
Now. don't get me wrong: I've got
nothing to sax about homosexuality
as a whole. Hie only thing that real
ly disturbed me here was the quality
of the programming. Quite Iranklv,
I was either bored or horribly of
fended. Flic pieces ranged from
mosth harmless (Jean |oson's "Re
union" and Wentb Fong's 'Artilii ial
Intimacy") to kmk\ (Yvette C,hoy's
blackmail Material") to downright
dirt\ and explicit (C.hingari (.hum
ma and Angela Leonino's "Fatly
Sunbeam" and theaptlv titled "l'lav
ing With ()urselves").
Tin still not sure what to think; the

program as a whole hardly seemed
poignant or cohesive, fust what is
there to understand when we're pre
sented with senseless, grainy images ol
masturbating women in "Playing With
Ourselves," with men playing out a
male rape fantasy under the guise ola
t amp sentlup to I lititlt films in "('.hin
gari Chumma" or the protracted tiiis
en-scene of two women locked in con
tinuous kissing for the entire length ol
"For Amhramovit Love ('.octeau"?
"Artificial Intimacy" is one of the lew
shorts in the festival that attempts to ad
dress a broader issue namely, Chat
rooms and the lalsitv of today's commu
nication and cylier-relationships. ITie.
press release lor each of these piet es
makes its material seem like a true
work of art, with a thesis that tat kles
epic social themes. In most cases, n is
a strett h. a big stretch.
All in all. "(il ll is I ninterrupt
ed" is an ambiguous representa
tion ol Asian America — as well as
homosexuality — and probably
not worth your time.

"The Cut Runs Deep"
Friday, March 9, at 7:00 p.m..
Monday, March 12, at 9:00 p.m.
"The (lut Runs Deep" is the
only true "movie" of the festival
that I was able to view, shot on
nun film and running well into fea
ture length. It is about a half-1 Bul
garian, half-Korean guv named
Ben who works as the deliverv boy
lot a small Chinese restaurant in
New York. ()ne day. while making a
routine deliverv, Ben shares a mo
ment with a mvsterious m.in named
J.1)., a man who Ben somehow un
mediatelv senses is the leader ola
Korean street gang tli.it i im>. ram
pant through the Bit; Apple.
Kventuallv, Ben comes to l>e a mem
ber of tins gang beginning his descent
into underworld acti\ ities and those age
old vices of power, mone\ and women.
ft» sum it up. it is the Korean-American
version of "Goodfellas."
I bis work was the most pol
ished of .ill the pieces 1 saw, and for
a good reason. I'he director. |ohn
If. Lee, is a recent graduate of the
prestigious New York I tiiversitv
lilm program.
I nfortunatelv, the brilliant at t
ing .nut directing couldn't bide the
fact that the film lits so convenient!)
into the label I've already men
tioned. It really is a knock-off of
"Goodlellas." I here is even a brash
Joe IVsci-like character to get on
your nerves. 1 don't know il such
Korean mobs really do exist in New
York, but it would be troubling to
think that Lee didn't know lie was
hlatantlv ripping oil Scorsese, also
an NYI graduate.
And like all di anias of this Ivpe. it
starts to lose steam in the last third ol
the movie as the characters become
mired in the situations they've creat
ed for themselves. Yet, even il most
of the storyline can't be attributed to
Lee. this is a director who's work I
definitely look forward to seeing
more of.
"The Cut Runs Deep" isn't a feel
good movie, but it is worth a look, and
it gives you hope that there are Asian
Americans who have the potential to
join the ranks of the elite Hollywood
cognoscenti.
"I.K.U
Screening: Monday, March 12, at
9:4*> p.m.
Hmm . . . where to begin. This
movie from Japan started out inno
cently enough: A cool prologue in
formed me that it is the 21st century
and a cotnpam named tlie Genome
Corporation has provided the world
with a sexual revolution in the form ol
1.K.1 . c(xlers, sexual roljots of some
sort. Oka\, a bit kinkv, but edgy and
interesting in that amine kind of way.
Within minutes, however, the
lilm launches into what turns out
to be little more than one huge, or
giastic session of hardcore pornog
raphy. Virtual pornography, that
is. combining live action with a
di/zving arrav of special effects, the

culmination ol which is a comput
er-generated phallus writhing and
twirling around in a nebulous re
gion that need not be specified. II
that doesn't offend you, "Fk.l is
happy to accommodate: Nearly
every sexual situation imaginable is
portrayed here in some way or an
other. and, yes, it is explicit.
I say this not to entice you, dear
reader, but to give you a sense of

I he press release also claims that
there is a storv involved, but it will be
.i cold da\ m hell befoi e I go bat k to

judge this movie on its merits as a

festival (and a representation ol
Asian-America), I found n incom
prehensible and unbelievably ollen
stve. Folks, il you y alue voin sense ol
decency, steer clear. As lor me, I
figure I'm beyond saving now.
"Secret Sounds"
Screening: Wednesday. March If,
at 9:00 p.m.
Probably the most poignant
program I was able to \ iex\, "Se
cret Sounds" is a collection of
shorts that best approximates
thctvpeofniateri.il I yvas expect

took tins assignment.
Fhe program begins with "In

hit its stride with the short "Secret
