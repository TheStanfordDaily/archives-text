about lashion, glit/ and glamor. I

I li.it said, il vou need a little help
with youi Oscar pool. 1 think I've
got these jokers figured out
Best Picture. What will win:

Best Aetor. Russell Crowe for

Best Actress. Julia Roberts for
"Erin BrockovuTi. Duh. Could
anyone else win t I lis?" Brockovich"
is going to win ai .least one big
award, and this is it.
— Hilary Bienstock, Contributing Writer

Best Picture. "Ti a (He." This came
down to a deaMi'U between Traffic"
and great 'Viowrhing Tiger,
Hidden Dragon." The othei tjjta'e films
in ihiscategon didn't even deserve to be
nominated. In the end, 1 decided Steven
Soderbertrh's three-part, saga was
more wortbV of thej)ri/S benuse of its
skillful handling ol a complicated issue,
and becaiiso Ang Lee's masterpiece
should m-i jLs share of recognition In* t.ik
ing noiU£ the Oscar for best Foreign
Language Film.
Best Actor. Geoffrey Rush for
"(Quills." Tins Australian actor deserves
to pick up his second Academv Award
lor his wonderful, funny performance as
the always interesting Marquis de Sade.
As for his competition, the other Ix-st
performances of the year were turned in
bv George (llooney ("(.) Brothei. Where
art fhou?"), Mark Ruflalo ("You Can
Count on Vie") and Michael Douglas
("Wonder Boys"), none of whom were
even nominated.
Best Actress. Luura l.inney for
"You Can Count on Me. Barring a
shocking upset, Julia Roberts is going
to walk awa\ with this Oscar. That's a
shame, because Laura lanney deliv
ered an emotional yet brilliantly sub
tle performance as a single mom deal
ing with her young son, overbearing
Ixiss and ne'er-do-well brother in
Kenneth Lonergan's surprisingly af
fecting film, which deserved more
than the two nominations it received.
— Jon Cohen

Best Picture. " I'raftic." By far,
"Traffic* is the best i no vie of the

year No gu\N in skirts and sandals
trying to kill other gu\s, no hoochie
manias trying to save the world, no
chick lights or people flying on
rooftops, no chocolate eating town
ies— just one good movie.
Best Actress. 111lia Roberts. 1
would say that the third time is a
charm for |ulia Roberts. Her work
in "1 rin Brockovich" is excellent. I
mean, bow main other actresses
can sav, "They're called boobs,
Ed," with .i straight lace?
— Misty Espinoza, Contributing Writer

Best Picture. I lie nomination
of "(Ihocolat for best pit lure is an
indication of the weakness of the
films of the past year. Wild card
movies in a similar romantic come
dy vein have been worthy con
tenders in the past, like "Four
Weddings and a Funeral," but this
nomination feels like filler.
Best Actress. Witli that said, ni\
pick lor best actress is Judi Dench
for her role in "Chocolat." It
doesn't seem possible that this is
the same woman who appeared in
all those Bond mov les.
— Monya De, Staff Writer

Best Picture. "Gladiator."
Soderbergh's two films split his
votes, aiul "Grouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon" wins best for
eign film, thus clearing the way
for "Gladiator" to take the big
prize.
Best Actor. l oin Hanks. Hie
Acaderm loves l orn. Given that he
lost .1 dangerous amount of weight
for his role in "Gastawav." Acade
my niemhers will leel that the\ owe
iiim the C )scar.

Best Actress. Julia Roberts. In a
fairh weak category this year,
| uli.i's endearing smile will touch
the hearts of the voters. I'nless, of
course, Harvey Weinstein can
lobbv Juliette Binoche up onto the
awards platform.
— Nathan Lasche, Contributing Writer

Best Picture. Without a doubt,
my vote would go to the consis
tent!) daring and compelling
"Traffic" as the best film of 2000.
('.ranted, it will probably lose out to
a "safer" action epic, namely
"Gladiator" or "Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon." But to ignore
Steven Soderbergh's complex
drug trafficking tale, along with
Benicio Del Koto's performance,
would be a crime.
Best Actor. Of the four 1 have
watched (Javier Bardem being the
exc eption), 1 think m\ pick would be
Kd Harris for his wretched down
turn as the famous American
painter in "Pollock." although Rus-
II Crowe is a close second as Mr.
Gladiator. The Academy will likeK
atone for " fhe Insider" debacle and
give the statuette to the Aussie.
Best Actress, if 1 had seen
"You Can Count on Me," I
might penc il in Linnev (who was
«]iiit<.' good in "The House of
Mirth"). But my selection — as
well as the award — will go to
Julia Roberts as the pluck\
lawyer's assistant in"F.rin Brock
ovich." Ms. Brockovich has even
publicly stated that )iilia "got n
so right," and, in a year when
there were few high-visibility ac
tresses in quality roles, Holly
wood's actress will finally take
home C )scar gold.
