### TIFFANY LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
-1 don't know where to begin
or how to describe the " leatro
Zin/anni" experience. I could
start l>\ commenting on the ex
quisite live-course dinner,
served In our French waiter,
Jean I'ierre, or mavhe I should
start with a description of the
unique cast ol characters and
ama/ing contortionists, but the
one word that ran through my
mind the whole time was sim
ply. Wow. It was like Cirque du
Soleil. although the acrobatics
were not quite .is atna/ing
I'm sure you've seen the
huge yellow and blue tent with
"Love, Chaos & Dinner" bla
zoned across the front il you've
driven along Kmbarcadero on
the wav to Fisherman's Wharf.

In mam wavs, the show began
even before the performers took
the stage. I he maitre'd brought lis
to inn table, and we were greeted
with <i neath arranged plate of
sauces and dips for the bread,
course No. 1
I he main characters of the
show werealreach making their
way around the room in their
roles, each exhibiting unique
and, franklv. quite eccentric
personalities.
l'he characters I encountered
m these first few moments who
made the biggest impressions on
me were a 20-plus-year-old "lit
tle' girl with pigtails, who was
running around stealing bread
off all of the tables. Also of note
was the head maitre'd of the
show, a pale-faced vampire
escjue character who slunk
around the room, never speak

ing. but (learh making his domi
nating presence felt. Vf'ter even
one was seated, the lights went
out and the energetic hostess
catne out into the light, begin
ning a night not so much of love,
chaos and dinner, but of chaos.
se\ and dinner, l'he chaos was
rampant and the sexual innuen
does and tension were om
nipresent throughout the
evening.
I lie best part of the show was
that ii wasn't jnst an audience
watching amazing people doing
atna/ing links. It u.is an audi
ence interacting with ama/ing
people who could do ama/ing
tricks, l'he cast plaved with the
audience as il it was there as
much for their amusement as it
was foi its own.
I he maitre'd danced with the
women in the room, led a game

of musical chairs and blew steam
out of his collar. Despite his
solemn and domineering air, lie
blew soap bubbles at the audi
ence and pulled flowers out of
hats.
And the acrobatics were stun
ning. rhere was juggling and
clowning and catching, but the
contortionists were the most
ama/ing act. especialb ihe leop
ard woman. I didn't know people
were capable of bending the wa\
she did, and she did all her con
torting while hanging from a
trapeze bar.
And the cook. Cookie, was a
show in and of himself . He intro
duc ed all the dinner courses, one
In one, and, each time, he chose
a victim, either to strip or to act as
a human salad bowl. The most
amusing part of the show must
have been when the cook, who

came out to introduce the main
course as .1 drag queen, targeted
a brash audience member with
sexualb charged and sarcastii
jokes. I bis guv was sue ha good
sport that he whacked the drag
queen on the butt with a racquet
ball racquet and even kissed her
right 011 the lips.
Phe three-and-a-half-hour
dinner flew I>\. Even the waiters
became pan ol the show, compli
menting the introduction of each
course b\ franticallv running out
ol the kitchen in various cos
tumes. much to the delight of the
audience.
II you can spare the cash, I
would definitely suggest taking a
trip to Tier 29 on the Embar
cadero to check out "Teatro Zin
zanni â€” I.ove, Chaos 8c Dinner."
