# 3000 miles from being an enjoyable movie

### JACKIE SKAPIK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Hollywood just can't seem to
leave Elvis alone. It's not enough
that the\ have tarnished his image
with relentless potshots at his
weight, his drug addiction and his
brief, posthumous stint as Michael
Jackson's father-in-law. Now, it
looks as though the folks in Tinsel
I'own have seen lit to use his tight
leather pantsuits and pelvic thrusts
.is .1 glittery disguise for churning
out ultra violent films with terrible
scripts.
At least they will if newcomer
|)emian Lichtenstein manages to
start a trend with his directorial
debut, "3,000 Miles to (>racelaud."
Painfull) unoriginal and ollensive
l\ violent, the way Lichtenstein's
film attempts to invoke the legend
ol the King as a reasonable substi
tute fora new idea or an ounce of
artistic merit is not only unfair, it's
)ust plain cruel.
I Icre's the premise of the film: A
group of ex-cons, known as the Klvis
have a cool 1950s convertible, a
whole lot of machine guns and a
sure-fire plan to rob a big Vegas casi
no. Their ace in the hole? It's Klvis
impersonation weekend at the casi
no — .uid they're all going to dress
up like Elvis.
In a displax of shocking, almost
completely unprovoked violence,
the five outlaws — played by

Kevin Costner, Kurt Russell,
David Arquette, Christian Slater
and Bokeem Woodbine — open
lire on casino securitv at the first

sign of trouble,
massacring hun
dreds of innocent
gamblers in the
process.
The cama
raderie established
between the ex
cons is awkward
and uninteresting.
(lonvenienth. most
of them are killed
oil before the audi
ence gets to know
or care about their
characters. This
sets up an extreme
ly common sce
nario between the
two remaining
heavies: Struggle
between Russell,
the bad guy who is

tually good at heart (we know this
because he winces before he fires
his machine gun .it people), and
Costlier, the bad guy who is com
pletely and utterly bad (we know
this because he laughs before he
shoots his machine gun and uses
the most swear words).
While Russell has several like
able moments and does one heck
of an Elvis impersonation, (Hostner
is thoroughly unappealing and

complete!) miscast as a psycho
without an ounce ol remorse. Pile
best acting in the film comes from
two unlikely sources: Courtne\

Cox Arquette — the trailer trash
love interest for Russell's charter
and rappei Ice-1 in a puzzling
live-minute cameo in which he eats
a jell) sandwich, Hies through a
room upside-down shooting two
machine guns and then dies.
The wardrobe is stolen straight
out of I-1 vis's closet,but at least it
looks accurate. The script, on the
other hand, is an inept Karantino
imitation that is unable to come

anvwhere near the level of sophis
tication or irony that might have
given the heft\ dose of violence an
original spin. Instead, the film has

to resort to sight gags like
Arquette dancing like
Elvis — and larting when
he does the pelvic thrusts
— and mind-nuinbiugly
boring conversations
about what would hap
pen in a death match be
tween Elvis and Sinatra.
Even when the
film is not ttying to be
funin (and failing miser
ably), it teeters danger
ousl) close to some of the
worst action movie lines
in history, with classics
like the following com
ment Cost tier's character
makes to Russell's during
a climactic standoff with
the police: "You know,
Mike, you're a bad gu\.
You ma\ not be as bad as

me. but vou're still a bad guv."
I he biggest problem with (his
movie isn't the acting or the si ript.
It isn't even the fact that Kevin

Hollywood just can't seem to
leave Elvis alone. It's not enough
that the\ have tarnished his image
with relentless potshots at his
weight, his drug addiction and his
brief, posthumous stint as Michael
Jackson's father-in-law. Now, it
looks as though the folks in Tinsel
I'own have seen lit to use his tight
leather pantsuits and pelvic thrusts
.is .1 glittery disguise for churning
out ultra violent films with terrible
scripts.
At least they will if newcomer
|)emian Lichtenstein manages to
start a trend with his directorial
debut, "3,000 Miles to (>racelaud."
Painfull) unoriginal and ollensive
l\ violent, the way Lichtenstein's
film attempts to invoke the legend
ol the King as a reasonable substi
tute fora new idea or an ounce of
artistic merit is not only unfair, it's
)ust plain cruel.
I Icre's the premise of the film: A
group of ex-cons, known as the Klvis
have a cool 1950s convertible, a
whole lot of machine guns and a
sure-fire plan to rob a big Vegas casi
no. Their ace in the hole? It's Klvis
impersonation weekend at the casi
no — .uid they're all going to dress
up like Elvis.
In a displax of shocking, almost
completely unprovoked violence,
the five outlaws — played by

Kevin Costner, Kurt Russell,
David Arquette, Christian Slater
and Bokeem Woodbine — open
lire on casino securitv at the first

sign of trouble,
massacring hun
dreds of innocent
gamblers in the
process.
The cama
raderie established
between the ex
cons is awkward
and uninteresting.
(lonvenienth. most
of them are killed
oil before the audi
ence gets to know
or care about their
characters. This
sets up an extreme
ly common sce
nario between the
two remaining
heavies: Struggle

tually good at heart (we know this
because he winces before he fires
