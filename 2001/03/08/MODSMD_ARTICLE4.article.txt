were taken from In the militarv in
the countrv's civil war of'the 1980s

added that, in many cases, kid
napped children were taken to
"houses of fattening." where thev
were fed well to increase their

upwards of $18,000 I .S.
Probusqueda made rapid

had received 018 requests from

I)e ('.ortina bemoans the fact
that virtually all of the perpetra
tors ot the kidnappings and child
salo remain unpunished. He c ites
corruption and fear ot witness
reprisals as the main factors pre
venting action.
"()nce, we had a judge who said,
'Yeah, I can give testimony, but
what happens to me afterward?'
s.ud de (.ortina about a potential
witness to military offenses.
l)e (lortina said he rejects those
who tell him that his quest to re
unite children and persecute the
guilt\ parties should be dropped
because the events happened so
long ago. "Much i* being said of
forget and forgive,' de Cortina
said. "I reallv think that to forget is
impossible. I he\ areden\ ing us of
