# Two white-bread actors star in "The Mexican"

### MARISA TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
II the words "romantic" and
"comedy" uttered as a phrase gen
et allv make m>ii want to groan and
high-tail it to the other end of
Blockbuster, fear not. "The Mexi
can," starring Brad Pitt ("Fight
I Huh") and Julia Roberts ("Krin
Brokovich"), is certainly more than
the typical maudlin fare that
boyfriends everywhere will hate
being dragged to see.
Though the film is not totally
devoid of cheese, Pitt shines in bis
comedic role and shows tb.it lie has
surpassed bis status as mere
swoon-inducing eye candv for the
ladies. He has timing, he has wit
and, teamed opposite Roberts and
James (>andoliini("The Sopra
nos"), he has the ability to project
the quirkiness necessary to earn
ofl j.il. Wvman'soffbeat script.
I be basic premise of the film is
that Jerry Welbach (Pitt) is a cluin
s\ crimester who just can't seem to
get it together. For one, bis girl
friend, Samantha B.u/.el (Roberts),
is giving him an ultimatum: Kither
bis gun-toting, felonious ways
must make a disappearing act, or
their relationship is over.

The only problem is that Jerry
is indebted to bis boss and must
perform one final mission, with
the not-so-happening alternative
of being stuffed in the trunk of a
car and toted off to be killed. Re
luctantly, Jerrv agrees to make the
trip south of the border to capture
,i legendary gun called the "Mexi
can" in order to be let off the hook.
I'nfortunately, Samantha,
Jerry's emotionally explosive, pop
psychology-obsessed lover (she is
seen carefully reading and high
lighting .1 book called "Men Who
Can't Love") is less than pleased by
the situation. After .1 heated argu
ment, they each go their separate
ways, resulting in unpredictable
but intertwined journeys. While
|errv faces all kinds of disaster in
Mexico (turns out the gun be seeks
is cursed) Samantha takes off lot
Vegas, only to be kidnapped In .1
brute named Leroy (C.andolfini),
who also wants the Mexican, bring
ing on an interesting and unex
pected kind of chaos.
Two main aspects of the film
make it worth seeing: One being
Pitt's comedic timing, .is enhanced
by the quick, eccentric, often slap
stick humor used by Wyman and
implemented by director Gore

Verbinski, and the othei being the
on-screen chemistry between
Roberts and (landolfini.
Pitt manages to combine just the
light amount of deadpan and
physical comedy to jive well with
Verbinski's style, bringing about .1
lot of quick laughs .is a result of
clever lines and strategic camera
angles. As the film progresses, Pitt
does .111 excellent job of being the
simple, easygoing guv who really
wants to do the 1 itjht thing but just
happens to be in wa\ over bis head,
and be somehow manages to
ch.it 111 the pants off of us 110 matter
how ridiculous bis position. Ihe
cool thing .ihont Pitt in this film is

that, while we've seen
him be tough in movies
like "Fight Club," this
time the character he's
playing is kind of a
dork, but we still love to
love him anyway.
And, though this is
being said reluctantly
because 11 gets said way
too much, Roberts is
charming as well.
I bough she occasional
ly overacts (opposite
Pitt she is not a credible
character, but rather

|uli.l Roberts trying really, really
hard to be hot-beaded and throw
ing f.u too mut li oomph into it) she
is loveK opposite (iandolfmi.
rhe two develop .1 very loving,
protective alliance, despite the
whole hitman-hostage relation
ship that was prohahlv the most in
teresting part of the film, (i.m
dolfini is convincing .is the hitman
with .1 heart of gold struggling to
do his job and at odds with the
connection he has fostered with
Samantha.
Hie part of the film that is 1111-
settling is the wav that Mexii .111Â« nl
turc is approached and "clieesi
fied," if von will. Though the tooth

less guys and numerous car-steal
ing incidents that Pitt encounters
on bis little pilgrimage are certain
ly good for some laughs, you really
have to wonder if people of Mexi
can descent wouldn't be annoyed
hv the implication Ib.lt rabid dogs
.ind shady governmental figures
are cute and funny.
The story line at the conclusion
of the film was also fairly disap
pointing. All the tension and con
flict that was built up throughout
the narrative was (|iiicklv thrown
together into .1 hokey, I'm-trying
to-t oss- in - a-co 111 plica ted -plot -
twist-hut-really-I'm-just-try ing-to
finish-this-dainned-story kind of
ending. Ihe whole history be
-3 bind the Mexic an is revealed and
| summed up with .111 odd appear
ance bv Gene Hackman that just
doesn't tie together a potentially
interesting narrative.
In short, while "The Mexi
can'" certainly isn't your mom's
romantic comedy, it isn't pet
fed either. If anything, the film
is good fora laugh, but buyer
beware: If you try to read into
things too deeply, you're going
to be disappointed.


Calm down honey, you'll get that Oscar
