Sushi, it would seem, is a way of life
in Silicon Valley. Perhaps this is
owing to this food's promise of
healthy, light fare. Perhaps it is
trendy to be Eastern and minimalist
when power-dining in 21st century
style â€” or trendy to wait for 30 min
utes or more on the corner of High

and University to eat bad sushi under disco lights in a thick cloud of fog coughed up
by machines. Whatever the reason, Japanese restaurants (Miyake and beyond) are
heavily demanded and readily provided throughout the area.
So, as was our dilemma with Indian, it was difficult for us to choose one spot amidst
the droves. In the end, we pulled into the convenient and .ample parking behind an
unassuming little place called Akasaka on Kl ("amino in Menlo Park.
We entered through the back door and made our wav up to the stark dining room
with decor so neutral it slips entirely from memory. Was it gray? Were the tables yel
low wood? Wall-to-wall carpet in blue no. 64? Perhaps. Perhaps not. But, unless you
are seeking the kind of high-charged sake-bombing debauchery that cannot exist un
less multiply reflec ted in mirrored balls on the ceiling, low-ish-end Japanese dining is
characteristically unremarkable where interior decorating is concerned.

Aesthetics aside, then, there is a first impression that deserves exposition. We speak
of that initial moment, that opening waft that grabs your gut as you enter a sushi bar.
If the fish is not fresh, the funk will attest. We are happy to report that Akasaka
greeted us not with a soggy yellow-tailed stench, but instead with the softly pleasant
aromatics of subtle and soothing broth.
Appetites unspoiled, we settled into a table by the bar and ordered up edamame
(steamed soy beans) and a glass of plum wine to start us on our merry way. Plum wine
a controversial beverage, you should know. It is pungent and unique, thus liable to
provoke polar responses. Negar loves the sweetness and strength, while Blair is
vanked back in time to those horrific days of choking down Nyquil and Robitussin. We
put it to you.
Despite these opposing views of the wine, we were jointly underwhelmed by the
edamame. whit li was a bit gra\ and cold. Simple though the dish ;ua\ be, there is an
essential equilibrium that should be sought: The beans should be perfectly salted and
should, of course, be warm. A dewy coating should remain of the recent steaming
process, but ours was puddled and off-peak. With this mediocrity in mind, we were
wary of ordering anything complex.
What we got were lots of vegetables in the form of seaweed salad and man) a shi
itake roll and yasai roll (mixed vegetable). Where fish were concerned, we played it
simple with an order of tekkamaki (tuna roll) and maguro (tuna nigiri, meaning a
piece offish over a small chunk of rice).
As it happened, we did not regret our timidity; the vegetarian options indeed out
shined the tuna, whit h was line, bin better inside the buffering swaddles of rice and
seaweed provided in roll form, flic shiitake rolls were the first to be scarfed, with
mushrooms sweet and markedly flavorful.
Yasai rolls looked almost artificially colorful and also landed in that awkward size
/.one: One bite? (Lan you do it in two without the contents spilling down your chin and
into your soy-sauce supply? Can you "cut" it with chop sticks? Kven with all these trou
blesome side-effects, mind you, the yasai were pretty tasty and had a quite dynamic
texture and i runch.
In the end, we felt we'd laid down 20 bones each at Akasaka without much to show
for it. Perhaps tins is the role of icky Miyake: It provides only passable fare, but you
don't care because you're blinded by the strobe and busy strapping one on while
chanting and jumping on the furniture.
Kor our part, we will c ontinue the search fora palatable and tranquil alternative to
both.
