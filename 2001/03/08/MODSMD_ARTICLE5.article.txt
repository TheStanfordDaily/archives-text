I his isn't easv for Moore to do. I fe has
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a terminal
neurological disorder also known as Lou
(Jelirig's disease. The disease attacks the
nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord
and. gradually, usually within two to five
years of diagnosis, robs victims of their
abilitx to use their limbs, to speak and
eventually to swallow and breathe. How

ever, though patients' bodies deteriorate,
their minds remain intact.
It's the same disease that afflic ted Mor
rie Sc hwartz, a former so< iologx professor
at Itranclcis I niversitv. Schwartz became
famous aftei l ed Koppel interviewed him
on ABC. News's Nightline program and
one of his former students published the
book, "Tuesdays With Morrie." I he au
thor, Mitch Albom. recounts the weekly
conversations he had with Schwartz about
the professor's views on the world. I he
book has been on the New York limes
bestseller list for 177 weeks.
Moore, age 60, sits with his legs over the
side of his bed. and Miao helps him bal
ance the mouse on his lap on top of a pil

low and a book. Moore carefulh andslow
1\ maneuvers it to get the result lie wants.
He has mobility in his hands, but even
movement requires a coinentrated effort.
Miao, ('lass of 1997. is .1 member of
Stanford's volunteer group, The (living
Iree, named after Shel Silverstcin's chil
dren's book. I he group was founded in
1999 by two Stanford students whose fam
ilies have been affected by the disease.
Each volunteer is paired with a patient
with whom he or she spent a few hours
each week fora minimum of eight weeks.
I here are currently six student volunteers,
all of whom began their visits this quarter,
and a handful of others who are interested
but haven't vet received training.

Miao .md Moore share .111 interest in
computers. Miao is working with three
former Stanford students .it ('enter
score.com, an Internet startup that de
signs Internet games. Moore spent his life
working as a computer programmer.
When he began in 19(>7, computers used
punchcards and were so large that people
could walk inside.
Moore shared a storv about how .1 niece
once visited him at work and took .1 nap in
side a computer. He added with .1 laugh
that he didn't know if there was am con
nection between that experience and lu i
decision to become a < hemic <il cngineei.
Miao said he enjovs the friendship he
has developed with Moore and feels that

w
he is learning a great deal from their time
together. "Because 1 work on .1 startup,"
lie said, ".sometimes I get really involved in
a ver\ narrow niche of life. Visiting
| Moore| each week helps me put every
thing 111 perspe< tive."
Moore also appears to like the visits. I le
called Hie (living I ice a "noble c ause" and
repeatedh voiced appreciation for the as
sistant e Miao li.is provided.
W hen Donna Kiln, ( lass of L'OOO, and
Allen I eo, .1 senior, decided to start The
Stanford (living I ree.thcx were hoping to
foster |i Ist the kind of relationship that
Miao and Moore have: a give and take 111
which ihc patients, who are ulti
mateh homebound, benefit from
the company of .1 young person
and get help with tasks thev can no
longer perform. I he students gain
from the insight and history of an
older person who has a lot to share.
"These are still inspiring people,"
Kim s;lid. "Patients have so much
courage in the face ot this disease. A
lc >t ai c teaching the students sc > much
alxwt what's important in lite and
alxmt enjc >v ing one dav .it a time."
Kim and leo came to tbrm the
group be» ausc both of their moth
ers suffered from Lou Gehrig's
disease. I'hey were in the Human
Biology core together and one
dav, b\ chance, Kim mentioned
the disease, fhev said they then
learned how much the\ shared
and how helpful it was to talk

about their common experiences.
Teo's mother died when he was
in high school, and Kim's mother
was diagnosed with the disease
about three years ago. For the past
six months, Kim has been her moth
er's primary caregiver. "It's really
challenging, she said, "but a great
chance to spend time with her."
Teo explained that, in organiz
ing I'lie (iiving Tree, the\ intend
ed to help other people in the
Stanford communit\ who might
be dealing with the disease in their
families and also to provide access
for people who might not have
had anv exposure to it.
|oining the group would be an
opportunity for students to see
w hat the disease is like from cla\ to
dav in someone's home, rather
than in the clinic al setting ot a hos
pital or doctor's office.
A numbei of the volunteers are
pre-medical students and were
drawn to hav ing that chance to in
teract with patients up close.

Wendv Smith,a premedical senior,
said that, (luring her first \ isit with
F.velvn Pallas, 7.'t, disc ussed
what it had tell like tor Pallas the
first da\ sheeouldn't get out t»l bed.
and how the weakness in hei left
hand lias made it too difficult to
hold a towel. I'allas now dries her
self with a washcloth instead.
In order to l>e prepared for
what thev will encounter in these
homes, all of the volunteers lu\e
had a training session with Dallas
Forshew, head Nurse Manager of
the I ('.-San Franc isco Autotroph
ic 1 literal Sclerosis ('.enter.
\Olunteers also hear from Kim
and leo about their experiences.
Kim said her mother used to be in
great shape, until one da\ she fell
on the golf course and soon aftei
found out she had the disease.
She's now in a wheek hair and ran
no longer talk; Kim comniunii ates
with her using an alphabet board.
I he Stanford (living free
works together with the I ( Sl

< enter; all of the patients visited by
the volunteers are treated at
I'SCF.
Forshew supervises the joint pro
gram and said she is very happy with
how the \ lsits have gone. She said
she hopes to promt >te the same kind
of program in other communities.
" I he patients have just said
Hondo tul (lungs about how this is
enriching their lives," she said.
"And I think 'enriching* is a good
word to use all the wa\ around."
Forshew explained that many
of these patients do not have much
to look forward to, making the stu
dents' visits particularh special.
"I lere \ou have a voting face com
ing in, and it hi ings aw hole spark
to the da\ for [the patients], I liev
ver\ much look forward to the
visit. It's a real bright spot in their
week."
