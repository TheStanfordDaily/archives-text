I his isn't easv for Moore to do. I fe has
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a terminal
neurological disorder also known as Lou
(Jelirig's disease. The disease attacks the
nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord
and. gradually, usually within two to five
years of diagnosis, robs victims of their
abilitx to use their limbs, to speak and
eventually to swallow and breathe. How

ever, though patients' bodies deteriorate,
their minds remain intact.
It's the same disease that afflic ted Mor
rie Sc hwartz, a former so< iologx professor
at Itranclcis I niversitv. Schwartz became
famous aftei l ed Koppel interviewed him
on ABC. News's Nightline program and
one of his former students published the
book, "Tuesdays With Morrie." I he au
thor, Mitch Albom. recounts the weekly
conversations he had with Schwartz about
the professor's views on the world. I he
book has been on the New York limes
bestseller list for 177 weeks.
Moore, age 60, sits with his legs over the
side of his bed. and Miao helps him bal
ance the mouse on his lap on top of a pil

low and a book. Moore carefulh andslow
1\ maneuvers it to get the result lie wants.
He has mobility in his hands, but even
movement requires a coinentrated effort.
Miao, ('lass of 1997. is .1 member of
Stanford's volunteer group, The (living
Iree, named after Shel Silverstcin's chil
dren's book. I he group was founded in
1999 by two Stanford students whose fam
ilies have been affected by the disease.
Each volunteer is paired with a patient
with whom he or she spent a few hours
each week fora minimum of eight weeks.
I here are currently six student volunteers,
all of whom began their visits this quarter,
and a handful of others who are interested
but haven't vet received training.

Miao .md Moore share .111 interest in
computers. Miao is working with three
former Stanford students .it ('enter
score.com, an Internet startup that de

working as a computer programmer.
When he began in 19(>7, computers used
punchcards and were so large that people
could walk inside.
Moore shared a storv about how .1 niece
once visited him at work and took .1 nap in
side a computer. He added with .1 laugh
that he didn't know if there was am con
nection between that experience and lu i
decision to become a < hemic <il cngineei.
Miao said he enjovs the friendship he
has developed with Moore and feels that

w
he is learning a great deal from their time
together. "Because 1 work on .1 startup,"
lie said, ".sometimes I get really involved in
a ver\ narrow niche of life. Visiting

Moore also appears to like the visits. I le
