# ARCHING TO Minneapolis

1 here's no place like home.
Sure, San Diego isn't exactl\ "home" for the Stanford basketball
team, but it sure beats the heck out of Hii mingluin.
l hauks to a 28-2 record and a Pacific 10 Conference champi
onship, the Cardinal was rewarded foi its strong tegular season with
the No. 1 seed in the West Region of the NCAA Tournament and a
short trip to San Diego, where the team will tip off I Innsdav against
No. 16 seed I NC Creensboro.
"From our perspective, it's the best ending we could have asked
for," said head coach Mike Montgomery, who spoke at length about
the advantage of not iking cross-country to play. I fe knows .til too well
the pitfalls of traveling in the tournament — last year, the (lardinal lost
to UCLA and Arizona and were shipped out to Birmingham, Alab.,
eventually losing in the second round to North Carolina.
Various 'experts.' including KSPN's Diggei Phelps, were quick to
proclaim the West the easiest region within minutes of the announce
ment, but Montgomery refused to buv into the idea.
"They're not playing, he said. " I here are a lot of reall\ good bas
ketball teams in West, as there are in everv brae ket. I told the kids that
if we don't pl.iv good basketball at am point front tins point on, we're
going to be out of the tournament."
Playing poor basketball in the last two vears has led to carh c \its
for highly seeded Stanford teams in the last two veai s, but the plaxets
aren't about to succumb to the demons of past tournament failures.
"It's behind us," said sophomore guard Case\ |acobsen, "but the
feeling, the emptiness, will never be forgotten."
"(letting bounced in the second round leaves a bad taste in your
mouth." said senior forward Ryan Mende/. "Its up to [the seniors] to

Hawks, meanwhile, live and tlie b\ the pla\ t>f their guards, stellar

Duke once and nearh two other times this year. The I erps are only a
No. 3 seetl, but have the talent and depth to give Stanford fits should
the two meet in the regional final.
