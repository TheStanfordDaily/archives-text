I le told him to tell

Dean Smith — the legendary

"I basically told him, '( loach,
I don't want to be one <>l those
white guvs at the end ol the

toi everyone.' " said Mende/.
Stanfoi(l it was. I li.it f.ill. the
All-Dallas, All-'lexas player

storing average to the I'artn,
where n would be just .1 few
weeks belore there was .1 spot in
the starting lineup with Ins name

"When I came here. I was
thinking to myself. Tin gonna be

Mende/. "You re.ilK don't real

\ while indeed. In llrcvin
Knight s last \e.ll running the
point, the ( ardinal made it lo the
Sweel Hi and took I tali lo over
lime before falling, S'J-77. Not
that Mende/ had anything to do
Willi il.
"M\ ficshinaii \e.it. I was so
fai out of (lie doghouse I had to
sleep outside." lie said. "And

from the outside. And next year,
when Stanford Int the tourna

to contribute.

( .onfereiH e 111 !'• point field goal
pen cntagc dining thai season,
he hit two huge It-pointers
against College of (Charleston 111
the first round, then a couple
more against Rhode Island that

helped push the Cardinal into
the Final Four. Stanford would
lose a heartbreaker to kentuc k\
in the national semifinals. Nb-8f»,
but not before getting a taste of
the top of the college basketball
world.
"It was incredible." Mende/
said. "I can't really put into
words how iniK h that meant to
me. At the time, you're going
through it. vou don't realize
what a big deal and how impor
lant ii is — until vou bounced
out of the NCAA I'ournament
two years straight in the second
round."
After going down with .1 knee
i 11 j 111 \ five games into his junioi
season. Mende/ had surgct \ and
redshirted the season, meaning
be had to watt h from the side
lines as the ( ardinal lost to an
underdog Con/aga team in the

Returning from the 111 j 111 \.
though, proved to be easiei said

at the small forward spot, but.
aftei going through a shooting
slump and missing practice be
cause of Ins grandmother's
death, lie lost Ins spot 111 the line
up lo freshman ( asc\ |atobscn.
Making things woi se was the
tac 1 that Montgomcn nevei ga\e
Mende/ the explanation lie
wanted, but he knew the move
was probabh foi the best in the
end. even though the Cardinal
went down again carl\ in the

"Aftei the season." Mende/
said, "he told me he was rcalh
proud of 1 he- wa\ I handled m\-
