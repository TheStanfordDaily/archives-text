Without Ini tliei ado. here's w li.it w<
think the next three weeks have in si on
Toughest Easiest Regions
Ben: roughest region has to go to the
South l>\ a long shot. Starting with clc
fending national champion Michigan
State, vou then move ou to the two and
three seeds — North ( arolina and I loi i
da — who, until this week, had heen
talked about as hoth potential No I
seeds.
I lirow in the hard piessing \ u - inn
(iavalicrs, who heat hoth I>iik< ai
North ('.arolina during the regul.u m
son, a ver\ underrated Iresno Stan
team and the alwa\s clangeimis (ion/.i
ga /.ags. and this brae ket is wa\ deep.
Jeff: Hv contrast, the ( ardinal s We st

their great draw dining the OS Final

Ik >'k «>1 Maryland. most of the undcrbel
l\ ol this In at ket is prone to choking (In
dtana, ( iiu innati) or untested (St.
|oseph s).
Sleeper Teams
Hen: I am hummed that m\ original
( h>'ice as slecpci —St. |oseph's, which
! msls the nation's longest winning
siit.ik at IS — is slated to lake on the
( ml in the second round it both teams
win, I think the I law ks will gixe Stanford
a t> ngli game, but Stanford's cxpet ience
will be 1 rncial to the win.
M\ other sleepei school is out West
.is well, \rkansas is pla\ ing inspired bas
ketball right now, led bx |oe |ohnson.
I 00k for them to give Marxland tils in
tlx Sweet 1(> and maxbe make 11 all the
w.i\ to the Regional Finals.
|« II: Despite a xcrx inconsistent Big 10
season. lowa remains one ol the scarier
seventh seeds in the tonrnev; they had
i;i< at wins oyer Illinois and lowa State
irliei this season and finished strong by
i< pling Indian.l in their conference
li rnamcnt. Ibex ic a motle\ 1 tew of
jm o recruits. tiansfers and freshmen,
I>lll thc\ (.111 control the boards and
1 e w hen net essai \.
()\er in the South, it's tough to call a
five seed a sleeper, hut Virginia finds it
sell mired 111 a brutal brat ket and fat ing
tin percnuialh over.u hieving /.ags in
tip fiist rountl. Despite that, the ( ava
il s I taxi proxeii they're capable t)f bril
haul basketball when thc\ show up; it
they tome to play, they could run
tlnough Goti/aga and Oklahoma and
gixe Mi< higan State all it can handle.
First-Round Upsets To Look For
Ben: I like at ouple t>l the "f>-1 I" games
is potential first-round upsets, Xavicr al
w, 1 \s brings .1 battle-tested squad to the
tournament. and this year takes 011 a
ut ik Notre Dame team that somehow
in. naged to win the Western Division of
1 Big Feast. I think Xavicr's Davitl
st will shut down I'layei of the Year
ididate I ro\ Murphy of Notre Dame,
d the Musketeers will pull this one out.
(Ket 111 the Fast. I like Oklahoma
Slate to knock of] the I rojans of 1 SC..
I he (lowboys are playing with a lot of

emotion light now alter the death of
two ol then team m.ites in <t |anuar\
plane crash. I ilnnk the\ II exploit the
I rojans" lac k ol depth .md come out
with .1 win.
Although the top teams look piett\
safe, watt h out lor Kansas to lose to .1 ( al
Statc-Nortlu idge team that's been play
ing well tins year. Ihe chronicall\
under-achieving |avha\\ks are plagued
with injuries and could easil\ dto|> this
game.
finally, I don't know anything
about I on.l. but given high-seeded SI • (
teams' proclivities of losing in the first
round ((-corgia. South Carolina), look
out ()le Miss.
|efl: Cotta disagree with Hen on the
Kansas-Nortln idge game; although it
should be a battle. Kansas defends too
well to let themselves get tossed around
In the upstat ts from the big Skv.
All of the rest ol the l-IH matchups
look pi ftt\ suspect to me, and I particu
larly have no faith in the Indiana
lloosiers. Although new head coach
Mike Davis has them on a much more
even keel than bob "I Hurt Because I
Love" Knight, Indiana has a liiston of
tournament chokes rivaled In few. A
lough loss in the big 10 tonrncx doesn't
bring tliein into the big Dance with a lot
of momentum.
Fiist-round games against relativeb
tin scouted < >pponcnts can come down in
large part to coaching, and no one's
done more of that than C.eorgia .State's
l.eftv Driesell. who made the Panthers
the fourth NCAA fournament team of
his career this week. Against an experi
em ed but plodding Wisconsin team, the
rutin' gun Driesell should be able to ca
jole Ins boys into a win before the) run
into Maryland's wrecking crew.
Players To Watch
Ben: |ason Williams (Duke): I his guv is
ama/ing. Clutch shooting, bla/ing speed
off the dribble, great leadership fora
sophomore and outstanding defense.
My choice as National Player of the N ear.
Steve Blake (Maryland): Not as
flashy as .1 lot of other point guards
(Williams, I ro) Bell, Jamal I insley), but
Blake runs the offense to perfection and
(.111 bury a clutch three when needed.
Brett Nelson (Florida): Showed off
flashes of brilliance in last year's run to the
title game. (it eat outside shooter. And
he's a country lx>y from West Virginia.

|eft: ('.an 1 disagree with Williams .is a
pit k. both because ol Ins unbelievable
talent and because ot the ankle injin \ lit
sustained 111 Sunday's A(.(. final: il lie's
less than 100 percent, Duke can't < 01111
close to replat ing him.
Frank Williams (Illinois): Big 10
I'lavei ol the Yeai this veai. he's the
heart and soul ot the 111 i 1 11. II lie plavs
well, lhc\ < in toll through the Midwest
hi at ket. including Ai 1 zona, on then wax
to Minneapolis. II he slows down, lliex
con It I be in foi trouble as earlx as the sec
ond round.
|ason Kapono (I'( 1. V): I le s not the
only one on then team that t <111 do dam
age. but lie's a good bellwethct fin how
seriouslx the Bruins lake this test. It lit
tan turn up the defensive intctisitx and
Steve Favin t .1111 oniinuc to get stunning
intlix itlu.il pel lot mailt es out ol .1 couple
ol role plaxers. thex're not out ol the
Final loin running.
First-Round Games Not To Miss
Ben: Virginia x. (ion/aga: Best litst
rtiuntl game, hands dim 11.
Duke v. Monmouth: Duke could score
200 points ... In halltimc.
I ('.FA x. Hofstta: 1 ike |cll sax s. with a
l.avin toadied team, who knows who
cOll It! show up? 11«>1 si 1.1 toultl score an
upset or I ( FA t ould xx in bx "SO.
|eft: Boston College xs. So. I tali: 8.(..
fell tlisrespeited bx the selection 10111-
niission when it got snubbed loi a two
seed. We'll see it the team carries its un
derdog mentalitx into the N( A As.
St. |oc's vs. Cieorgia I'ech: St. |oe's has
gotten great bit// into the tournament
and Georgia I et h took the I at Heels to
the wire in the A(.( tout nex.
Kansas vs. Gal Statc-N'orthi idge: ()ne ot
the best scoring teams in the counirx
(Noi tbridge) x s. oneof the most plix sii al
(Kalis,is).
Most Overrated Team
Ben: I tlunk the most overrated confer
ence has it» he llu Big Fast, so pit k any
team you want from that group. I he tat t
that all of these st liools had tnediocic
conference records isn't .1 sign of parity
and tough conference plax — they're
just not that good. Syracuse, Notre
Dame. Boston ('.ollt ge. (icorgctown and
Providence all could get dropped in the
early rounds.
Before the conference tournament.

I would be tempted to sa\ that the big 10
was (ivcri.l ted .is well, but Wisconsin, In
diana and lowa .ill looked impressive in
the postseason, in addition to power
houses Illinois .ind Mi< liigan State.
|ell": II \ uginia and Sviacuse are Ibiu
seeds and ()le Miss i*, legitimately .i three
seed. I'll bu\ a pickup and.i gun rack
.md move clown to |a< kson. II this team
didn't pla\ in the Sl(., tlicv'd be more
like .i seven or eight.
Best Mascot Matchup
Hen: Ihe No. ."> seeded Svracusc Or
angemen t.ike on the No. 12 seeded
Hawaii Rainbows in the "I'm so jealous
vou're .i latck\ ( harms mat slunallow
llavi»i mas( (»t showdown.
|ell: 1 he lloosiers ol Indiana ti\ and
a\oid an upset b\ the Kent State (lolden
Flashes. Does anvone know what either
ol those things are?
Worst Snub Worst Inclusion By The
Selection Commission
IW n: Seton 11 all had a tetrible season
but has a team tli.it can heat anyone in
tlit country on a gi\en night with the
amount ol talent it has. II Ftltlic (u itlin
sta\s around and I onum \makei can
get the chemistry to gel, thc\ could be
awesome next season.
For worst inclusion, I'm going with
(•corgia. Muse gu\s are RIM lovers.
IMaved .i tough s( hedule but didn't real
l\ beat ati Mine good.
|ell: Worst snub goes to I c\.is C.ln ist
ian. not bei ause it's good but bet ause it's
the S.k t.unento Kings ol ( ollege basket
ball. Bills I übbs's team <an hang 100
points on anybody in the country and
still lose l>\ .'to. Honorable mention to
Mississippi State, whit h plavcd the lifth
toughest si hedule in the country and
beat At i/ona eat Iter this season.
Worst int lusion goes to Providence,
w ho rolled up a pretty good record (21-
0) m a piett\ trappy conference. |ohn
l.inehan s defense is shot king fun to
watt h, but they don't bring inut It else to
the table.
Final Four Picks
ben: Stanford, \ri/ona, Duke, Florida.
Jell: Duke (assuming Jason Williams is
healthy). Illinois, Virginia, Stanford.
