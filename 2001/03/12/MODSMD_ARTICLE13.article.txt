### WILL OREMUS EDITORIAL STAFF 
()n April 4, 1890, the Stanford
women s basketball team pulled out a
--1 victory over California in what
must have been a titani< defensive
struggle. It was the first intercollegiate
women s basketball game, and it set a
precedent for the incredible successor
the modern Stanford squads.
Ibis year's Cardinal plavers will
have a lot of tradition to look back on
.is they take the floor Saturday
against George \\ ashington. It marks
their 14th consecutive trip to the
NCAA Tournament. Since Tara Van-
Derveer took over as head coach in
108"), the Cardinal has participated
in six Final Fours and carried away
two National Championship tro
phies.
I he VanDerveer era began with a
whimper rather than .i bang, as her
first two Stanford teams had losing
records. Things picked up quickly in
the 1987-88 campaign when Van-
Derveer led the Cardinal to its first
Sweet 10. She earned National Coach
of the Year honors for her efforts.
B\ 1988-89, early VanDerveer re
cruits Jennifer A//i and katy Steding
had evolved into two of the best play
ers in the country. I he\ carried the
Cardinal to its first of 10 Pacific 10
Conference championships on the
way to an appearance in the NCAA re
gional finals.
Tor the first nine, Stanford found
itself at the center of attention going
into the 1989-90 tournament. Along
with A//i and Steding, Sonja Pfen
ning, Trisha Stevens and Julie Zeilstra
gave the Cardinal one of the most
high-powered attacks ever seen in
women's basketball.
The team steamrolled its way
through the season, compiling a 32-1
record on the wa\ to its first NCAA
(championship.
Perhaps most impressive was the
fashion in which Stanford destroyed
its opponents. The team broke the
100-point barrier 10 times, averaging
92 points per game for the season.
The Cardinal's 88-81 victory over
Auburn in the final served notice that

Stanford had arrived on the national
scene.
The next year was supposed to be
•i rebuilding season, but instead Stan
ford returned to the Final Four be
hind an outstanding season from Pac
-10 Player of the Year Henning. Hav
ing sustained some key injuries, Stan
ford fell to Tennessee in the national
semifinal, but hopes were high for an
other big season in 1991-92.
The '91-'92 team ended up sur
passing all expectations. Despite hav
ing otilv one senior, the Cardinal put
together a 25-3 record in the regular
season and headed into the tourna
ment on a roll.
As it turned out. the team peaked
at exactly the right time — late March.
After winning a dramatic 60-65 con
test over top-ranked Virginia, Stan
ford demolished Western Kentucky,
78-02, to win its second national
championship.
Stanford took a two-year hiatus
from the Final Four in 1992-93 and
1993-94, reaching the regional semifi
nals and regional finals, respectively.
By the 1994-95 season, the Cardi
nal had fully reloaded and was ready
for another brilliant season. Boasting
six talented freshmen and three dedi
cated seniors, Stanford amassed a 30-
.3 record and reached its fourth Final
Four.
The '95-'96 team reached the na
tional semifinals again, despite play
ing without Kristin Folkl or coach
VanDerveer, both of whom took time
011 to represent the United States in
the ( Hympics. Junior guard Kate Star
bird picked up the slack, leading the
Cardinal to a perfect record in the
Par-10. Georgia proved too much for
the (Cardinal in the Pinal Four, but the
loss did not diminish the team's sur
prising success.
By this time, Stanford had estab
lished itself as a fixture at the top of the
national rankings and a force to be
retkoned with every March. The Car
dinal's success in dealing with adversi
ty in '95-'9O raised hopes for the fol
lowing season.
Along with Starbird and Folkl, for
ward ()l\ mpia Scott and guard Jamila
Widcman made the 1990-97 Cardinal

one of the most dominating squads
ever to grace Maples Pavilion.
An early-season loss to Old Do
minion dampened hopes briefly, but
Stanford proceeded to run off an in
credible 25 wins in a row, taking them
into the Final Four for the third con
secutive year.
There, the Cardinal met Old Do
minion fora second time. Starbird
poured in 21 points in the first half to
give Stanford a six-point lead at the
break, Imt Old Dominion adjusted in
the second half and kept the margin
within reach.
A free throw with just under a
minute remaining put Stanford down
one as the game wound down. In the
final seconds, Wideman and Nvgaard
both missed potential game-winners,
and the Cardinal players were left
with broken hearts as the bu//er
sounded.
The 1 997-98 team saw the Final
Four streak come to a jarring halt. A
21-5 regular-season record earned
the Cardinal a top seed entering the
tournament, but injuries to Folkl and
Vanessa Nvgaard contributed to an
embarrassing exit.
1 he Cardinal lost to No. lf> seed
Harvard in the first round, an upset
unduplicated in NCAA tournament
history.
"This isn't what we planned,"
VanDerveer said at the time.
The loss marked a low point in
Stanford women's basketball — the
Cardinal's first loss at Maples since
1994 put <i sudden end to the brilliant
careers of Scott, Nvgaard, Folkl,
Naomi Mulitauaopele and Heather
Owen. All five joined the professional
ranks the next year.
Since 1998, Stanford has strug
gled to make a run in the tournament.
The Cardinal followed another first
round loss in '98-'99 with a second
round exit last year, ending a dec ade
of incredible success on a sotit note.
Stanford faces a tough draw in
this year's West Region. While a re
turn to the Final Four seems unlikeh ,
current Cardinal plavers in search of
inspiration need not look am furthet
than their own program's illustrious
past.

poured in 21 points in the first half to
give Stanford a six-point lead at the
break, Imt Old Dominion adjusted in
the second half and kept the margin
within reach.
A free throw with just under a
minute remaining put Stanford down
one as the game wound down. In the
final seconds, Wideman and Nvgaard
both missed potential game-winners,
and the Cardinal players were left
with broken hearts as the bu//er
sounded.
The 1 997-98 team saw the Final
Four streak come to a jarring halt. A
21-5 regular-season record earned
the Cardinal a top seed entering the
tournament, but injuries to Folkl and
Vanessa Nvgaard contributed to an
embarrassing exit.
1 he Cardinal lost to No. lf> seed
Harvard in the first round, an upset
unduplicated in NCAA tournament
history.
"This isn't what we planned,"
VanDerveer said at the time.
The loss marked a low point in
Stanford women's basketball — the
Cardinal's first loss at Maples since
1994 put <i sudden end to the brilliant
careers of Scott, Nvgaard, Folkl,
Naomi Mulitauaopele and Heather
Owen. All five joined the professional
ranks the next year.
Since 1998, Stanford has strug
gled to make a run in the tournament.
The Cardinal followed another first
round loss in '98-'99 with a second
round exit last year, ending a dec ade
of incredible success on a sotit note.
Stanford faces a tough draw in
this year's West Region. While a re
turn to the Final Four seems unlikeh ,
current Cardinal plavers in search of
inspiration need not look am furthet
than their own program's illustrious
past.

The Stanford women's basketball team celebrates after winning the national championship in 1992.
()n April 4, 1890, the Stanford
women s basketball team pulled out a
--1 victory over California in what
must have been a titani< defensive
struggle. It was the first intercollegiate
women s basketball game, and it set a
precedent for the incredible successor
the modern Stanford squads.
Ibis year's Cardinal plavers will
have a lot of tradition to look back on
.is they take the floor Saturday
against George \\ ashington. It marks
their 14th consecutive trip to the
NCAA Tournament. Since Tara Van-
Derveer took over as head coach in
108"), the Cardinal has participated
in six Final Fours and carried away
two National Championship tro
phies.
I he VanDerveer era began with a
whimper rather than .i bang, as her
first two Stanford teams had losing
records. Things picked up quickly in
the 1987-88 campaign when Van-
Derveer led the Cardinal to its first
Sweet 10. She earned National Coach
of the Year honors for her efforts.
B\ 1988-89, early VanDerveer re
cruits Jennifer A//i and katy Steding
had evolved into two of the best play
ers in the country. I he\ carried the
Cardinal to its first of 10 Pacific 10
Conference championships on the
way to an appearance in the NCAA re
gional finals.
Tor the first nine, Stanford found
itself at the center of attention going
into the 1989-90 tournament. Along
with A//i and Steding, Sonja Pfen
ning, Trisha Stevens and Julie Zeilstra
gave the Cardinal one of the most
high-powered attacks ever seen in
women's basketball.
The team steamrolled its way
through the season, compiling a 32-1
record on the wa\ to its first NCAA
(championship.
Perhaps most impressive was the
fashion in which Stanford destroyed
its opponents. The team broke the
100-point barrier 10 times, averaging
92 points per game for the season.
The Cardinal's 88-81 victory over
Auburn in the final served notice that

Stanford had arrived on the national
scene.
The next year was supposed to be
•i rebuilding season, but instead Stan
ford returned to the Final Four be
hind an outstanding season from Pac
-10 Player of the Year Henning. Hav
ing sustained some key injuries, Stan
ford fell to Tennessee in the national
semifinal, but hopes were high for an
other big season in 1991-92.
The '91-'92 team ended up sur
passing all expectations. Despite hav
ing otilv one senior, the Cardinal put
together a 25-3 record in the regular
season and headed into the tourna
ment on a roll.
As it turned out. the team peaked
at exactly the right time — late March.
After winning a dramatic 60-65 con
test over top-ranked Virginia, Stan
ford demolished Western Kentucky,
78-02, to win its second national
championship.
Stanford took a two-year hiatus
from the Final Four in 1992-93 and
1993-94, reaching the regional semifi
nals and regional finals, respectively.
By the 1994-95 season, the Cardi
nal had fully reloaded and was ready
for another brilliant season. Boasting
six talented freshmen and three dedi
cated seniors, Stanford amassed a 30-
.3 record and reached its fourth Final
Four.
The '95-'96 team reached the na
tional semifinals again, despite play
ing without Kristin Folkl or coach
VanDerveer, both of whom took time
011 to represent the United States in
the ( Hympics. Junior guard Kate Star
bird picked up the slack, leading the
Cardinal to a perfect record in the
Par-10. Georgia proved too much for
the (Cardinal in the Pinal Four, but the
loss did not diminish the team's sur
prising success.
By this time, Stanford had estab
lished itself as a fixture at the top of the
national rankings and a force to be
retkoned with every March. The Car
dinal's success in dealing with adversi
ty in '95-'9O raised hopes for the fol
lowing season.
Along with Starbird and Folkl, for
ward ()l\ mpia Scott and guard Jamila
Widcman made the 1990-97 Cardinal

one of the most dominating squads
ever to grace Maples Pavilion.
An early-season loss to Old Do
minion dampened hopes briefly, but
Stanford proceeded to run off an in
credible 25 wins in a row, taking them
into the Final Four for the third con
secutive year.
There, the Cardinal met Old Do
minion fora second time. Starbird
poured in 21 points in the first half to
give Stanford a six-point lead at the
