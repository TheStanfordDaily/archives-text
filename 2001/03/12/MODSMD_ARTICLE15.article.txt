### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Casey Jacobsen has been the highlight of
the basketball buzz ever since his arrival on
the Farm two years ago. However, while Ja
eobsen's feats are amazing, even the sopho
more star might not be so eager to take on his
female equivalent: Stanford women's basket
ball's Nicole Powell.
Powell has wowed tans ever since her first
step onto the bouncy-floor of Maples Pavil
ion, when the freshman recorded .1 triple
double in her debut college performance, .111
exhibition game against RI I Clondica of
Latvia.
1 he exhibition game was just .1 stepping
otV point for the newcomer, who leads the
team s strong five-player recruiting class.
Powell has defined herself as not onl\ one of
the nation's leading freshman, but also one ot
the nation's premiere players.
"Nicole is a big time player," said Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer. "She is all
about winning tor our team, she is so excited
for our team. She makes great pla\ s. she gets
great rebounds and hits big shots."
I lie freshman finished the regitlai season
among the top !;"> in S-01-12 statistical cate
gories 111 the Pacific 10 Conference, while be
coming the first freshman ever to nab the
Pac-10 rebounding ( town.
In addition, in the Feb. 22 game against
Washington State, Powell became just the
third player in (Cardinal histoi \. and the se\ -
entli player in the history ot the conference,
to record a triple-double in .1 tegular season
game, tallying 10 points. 10 rebounds and 10
assists.
However, while the statistic s tell the tale of
.1 star-studded freshman vear, Powell lias far
from traveled the primrose path to success
1 Ins season.
A premiere center at Mountain Pointe
High School in Phoenix. Ariz., Powell was
originally slated to pla\ the shooting guard
or small forward position for the Cardinal.
However, after sophomore (aniie Carev was
forced to retire at the advent of the season
clue to concussions, and freshman Susan
King suffered .1 season-ending tear of her
.interior cruciate ligament, VanDerveer
c alled upon Powell to step up at the point
guard position.
"We are asking her to do something that is
verv hard," VanDerveer said. "She has not

only changed the level going
from high school to college, but
we have her playing a much dif
ferent position."
The position has provided a lot
of adjustments for the freshman,
and while she has still managed to
average a near double-double in
points and rebounds throughout
conference play, handling the ball
hasn't been as easy.
She is often defended b\
guards that are six or seven inc li
es shorter than her, including
I CLA's Natalie Nakase, who
stands a whole foot shorter than
the 6-foot-2 Powell. While height
is always assumed as the obvious
advantage in basketball, a tall
point guard is much more \ ulner
ablc to the swatting and quickness
most often displayed b\ .1 shorter
guard.
Karl) in the conference season,
turnovers and miscommunica
tion led fans to wonder what Van-
Derveer was doing with Powell at
the point. While it was evident
that she was a great playci. being
.1 great point guard was another
question.
However, questions were no
better answered than In her per
formances this weekend at the
Arizona schools. Powell s posi
tion was solidified, as the fresh
man took 1 lie team under her
control, displaying the confi
dence expected ot a muc li older
player.

"Slu' stayed poised and lot used, and u.h a
great floor leader lot us." \ anDerveer said.
" I his meant a lot to Nicole being from Aii
/ona. 1 think she realh just put the team on
her hat k. She |iist stepped up and said,' I his
is important to me.' "
Powell scored II points and grabbed 21
boards in her two-game homecoming, lead
ing the Cardinal to its 1 ()th l'ac-10 title.
I towever, more important than the points
she scored or the boards she grabbed were
the little things the freshman did to show how
important it was tor the team to win. She was
the one nailing the three w hen Arizona tame
within tour points in 1 hursdav s game, and
she was the one inabbinu the rebound and

WILLIAM WEST/ The Stanford Daily
Freshman Nicole Powell, a likely candidate for Pac-10 Fresh
man of the Year, recorded a triple-double earlier this year.
Casey Jacobsen has been the highlight of
the basketball buzz ever since his arrival on
the Farm two years ago. However, while Ja
eobsen's feats are amazing, even the sopho
more star might not be so eager to take on his
female equivalent: Stanford women's basket
ball's Nicole Powell.
Powell has wowed tans ever since her first
step onto the bouncy-floor of Maples Pavil
ion, when the freshman recorded .1 triple
double in her debut college performance, .111
exhibition game against RI I Clondica of
Latvia.
1 he exhibition game was just .1 stepping
otV point for the newcomer, who leads the
team s strong five-player recruiting class.
Powell has defined herself as not onl\ one of
the nation's leading freshman, but also one ot
the nation's premiere players.
"Nicole is a big time player," said Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer. "She is all
about winning tor our team, she is so excited
for our team. She makes great pla\ s. she gets
great rebounds and hits big shots."
I lie freshman finished the regitlai season
among the top !;"> in S-01-12 statistical cate
gories 111 the Pacific 10 Conference, while be
coming the first freshman ever to nab the
Pac-10 rebounding ( town.
In addition, in the Feb. 22 game against
Washington State, Powell became just the
third player in (Cardinal histoi \. and the se\ -
entli player in the history ot the conference,
to record a triple-double in .1 tegular season
game, tallying 10 points. 10 rebounds and 10
assists.
However, while the statistic s tell the tale of
.1 star-studded freshman vear, Powell lias far
from traveled the primrose path to success
1 Ins season.
A premiere center at Mountain Pointe
High School in Phoenix. Ariz., Powell was
originally slated to pla\ the shooting guard
or small forward position for the Cardinal.
However, after sophomore (aniie Carev was
forced to retire at the advent of the season
clue to concussions, and freshman Susan
King suffered .1 season-ending tear of her
.interior cruciate ligament, VanDerveer
c alled upon Powell to step up at the point
guard position.
"We are asking her to do something that is
verv hard," VanDerveer said. "She has not

only changed the level going
from high school to college, but
we have her playing a much dif
ferent position."
The position has provided a lot
of adjustments for the freshman,
and while she has still managed to
average a near double-double in
points and rebounds throughout
conference play, handling the ball
hasn't been as easy.
She is often defended b\
guards that are six or seven inc li
es shorter than her, including
I CLA's Natalie Nakase, who
stands a whole foot shorter than
the 6-foot-2 Powell. While height
is always assumed as the obvious
advantage in basketball, a tall
point guard is much more \ ulner
ablc to the swatting and quickness
most often displayed b\ .1 shorter
guard.
Karl) in the conference season,
turnovers and miscommunica
tion led fans to wonder what Van-
Derveer was doing with Powell at
the point. While it was evident
that she was a great playci. being
.1 great point guard was another
question.
However, questions were no
better answered than In her per
formances this weekend at the
Arizona schools. Powell s posi
tion was solidified, as the fresh
man took 1 lie team under her

dence expected ot a muc li older
