W hen all is said and done, at least the
Cardinal won't he in unfamiliar territory in
tins yeat s \( AA Tournament.

After battling through a tough weekend
on the road, sweeping past Ari/ona State and
Arizona en route to a l'ac-10 championship
and.in automatic N('.AA I ournament berth,
the Cardinal might have expected a little
more than a No. 10 seed.
However, taking into account Stanford's
topsy-turvy season, it'll take what ii can get,
considering five days ago a berth alone was in
question.
"1 am just glad we are in, said head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "We can always
look back and try to be greedy."
The Cardinal, the No. 10 seed in the
West, will plav seventh-seeded (ieorge Wash
ington in ()klahoma on Saturday. T his is the
Cardinal's second trip to Norman, Okla.,
after it battled the Sooners on Dec. 27, com
ing up with .i 102-98 overtime loss.
While the Cardinal played well in the
contest, freshman point guard Susan King
was injured in the first half of the matchup.
"Our team should be excited," Van
derveer said. "We've played there, and we
played well there."
While both ()klahoma and Stanford have
grown a lot since that game, their dose game
should give the Cardinal some reassurance if
it meets the second-seeded Sooners in the
second round. Oklahoma is slated to play-
Oral Roberts in the first round.
While the Sooners are definitely the
hometown favorites, there shouldn't be a
shortage of Cardinal fans in the stands. Se
nior Sarah Dimson is from Norman, and, de
spite playing for Stanford, she will be a hom
town favorite throughout the first two

rounds.
"( )ur team will be motivated to do well
there, and we've played there, Dimson said.
"We gained a tremendous amount of conli
denee this weekend."
I lie rest of the West bracket looks tough,
with Atlantic Coast Champions, Duke, lead
ing the pat k with the top seed. I he Blue I)ev
ils are arguably the weakest of the No. 1 seeds
in the tournament and will be playing far
from home it they survive the first two
rounds.
Florida and Rutgers round out the host
ing teams, getting the third and fointli seeds
respectively. I he Gators have made a huge
comeback this season, after failing to .1
tournament berth last season. Rutgers is one
of the top perennial women's basketball pro
grams and is led by head coach C. Vivian
Stringer.
I he Cardinal is quite familiar with the
No. 1) seed in its bracket, as co-l\tc-10 cham
pion Washington was placed in that spot
after sporting an RIM signifu antl\ high t
than the Cardinal's. Stanford squared oil
with the Huskies twice this season, as each
team won at home.
The Pac-10 faired rather well in tourna
ment selection, and. while its seeds might be
a little lower than expected, many critics
didn't think the conference could get four
teams into the tournament after beating each
other up so much this season.
In addition to Washington and Stanford,
Arizona State received a No. 1 I seed in the
Mideast, while Oregon was placed at No. I.S
in the Midwest.
