Moos and Dimson have shown
through then dedication to the
Stanford squad that the\ are
more similar than some would
think.
Moos broke out with a strong
individual performance hei
.sophomore season, \ftei placing
behind the likes ol fleathei

throughout her lieshman cam
paign, she was icalb called upon
tot aptain the post position in her
second \ear. She led the team in
rebounding ((">.7 rpg) and
blocked shots (4l>), while averag
ing 12.9 points per game, good

tion honors.
Last \ear, Moos simph con
tinued from where she had left
off, averaging team highs in scor
ing .md rebounding, while eai n
ing All-l'ac-10 Honorable Men
lion honors again.
Moos s linal veai at the l ; arm
has had its tips and downs, and
w bile she has stai led in 2~> of the
( animal s 29 games, hei scoring
average and rebounding avci age
are somewhat under what the\
have been in recent seasons.
However, the senior s contribu

tioned, and there have been sev

where she lias contributed (iiii

"F.vcrv \e.u has had it's own

Dimson lias matle a similiai b

man, she played in 22 games

sc liooi histon.
However, Dimson s true
value .is a plaver cannot be seen

a share of the I'ai -10 title, tliev are
eagei to gel one more shot at the
NC'.AA I ouruament. Hut even
with the conference title and a
tournament bid, the injuries to
guards Susan King and Jamie
Harey have made this season
much more difficult for Stanford.
"Ii has been extremeh tough."
Dimson said of her turbulent se
nior year. "Our team has been
through the trendies both phvsi
callv. mentally and emotionally,
but we're pcaking'at the right lime,
and we have a lot more to show."
"When vou have goals, you
don't let go of them. Moos
added. "And, while it has been a
tough veai. people have stepped
up and plavcd then new posi

Final loin as a goal, \<>u don't

So what's in store lot the sc

"There I s * .1 certain atmos

comes down to it. I am going to

"A lot of little experiences, es

mote the collective feelings you
get from even single experience.
It's been great."
