W hen Mi Donald came to Stanford
lour years ago, the spotlight remained
on his predecessors Brevin Knight and
Arthur l.ee. the two most famous point
guards in Cardinal historv. while Mc-
Donald waited patienth in the back
ground.
I Yen todav. alter leading the No. 1
Sianlord men s basketball team to its
third straight Pai ifii 10 ('.onlerence title,
Mi Donald continues to hi 1 overshad
oweil b\ his lellow starters.
Am C ardinal ian could tell you
which Collins twin is older (Jason, by
eight minutes), or how main conseiu
ii\e free throws Ryan Mende/ made to
break the Par-10 record (19), or Case\

crosses hall (ouit). But vcr\ lew would
know that Mi Donald leads the Pac-10 in
M-point shooting (.500) and assist-to
lurnoYei ratio (3.1), two ke\ reasons
win tin- Cardinal is primed to take home
its hist national championship in o\cr
50 years.
I lie media overlooks McDonald as
well. Belore the season slat ted, he was
called tlu' weak link on an otherwise tal
ented starting five. Mi Donald's critics
i lainietl he l.u ked a scorei 's mindset and
could not defend well against mucker

guards.
McDonald has responded well to the
criticism.
"If I'm the weak link on this team, I
think I'll take it, he said. "We li.iyc
some great plavers on our team — ( ase\
Jacobsen, the twins, R\an Mende/ —
thev're all wonderful shooters, so [other
teams] are not going to leave those gu\s
open. II thev leave me open. I think I've
been doing a good job this vear being a
threat on the offensive end and playiiig
prettv good [ilefensel.
"A good job" is an understatement
of how much Nh Donald's game has un
proved this season. I he numbers never
lie. A career .320 percent field-goal
shooter before the season started, Mc-
Donald has raised that figure to .101.
Kvcii more impressive is Nh Donald's '.\-
point shooting ibis season. He has shot
an astonishing .500 from behind the an .
up from ..'U7 a vear ago.
"I don't think I've ( hanged tin pla\
too much," McDonald said. "1 |iist
think I've been open lot a lot more
shots. I've been able to Int those shots a
lot more than 1 have in the past. Anv
time \on hit more shots, vou gain a lot
of confidence."
Now that McDonald leads the Pac
-10 in 3-point shooting, one can onlv
wonder how lie stacks up with team
mates (acobsen and Mende/. two of the
most prolific ,'l-point shooters in Stan
ford historv. Mende/ and |acobsen's
games of lIORSI- during practice are
historic, but have the\ allowed Man
ford's newest 3-point threat to join in on
the fun?
According to McDonald. "I beat
Mende in HORSI freshman veai twice,
and he won't pla\ me anvmore. I don't
pla\ Casi'\ because he shoots from too
far back all the lime, (seven-loot tentei
|asoii Collins) talks ,i lot of trash about
winning [a game oil HORSH, but he

c an't handle am of us."
Of course, there are two sides to
every ston . and Jacohsen's take i*. a little
different.
"Yeah, I've plaved [McDonald in
11( )RSK|, and I beat him even time and
so docs Mende, |acobsen said. "Me and
Rvan alw.ivs tease Mike\ that, '|< )ppos
ing teams] 11 ist leave vou open. M i kcv. so
of course vou're going to shoot ">() per
cent with nobod\ on vou. li the other
teams let us shoot open threes, we'd be
shooting as good .is vou.' "
Hut, Jacobsen will still give credit
where (t edit is due.
" I he difference now is |tiiat Mc-
Donald is] a confident shooter Jacob
sen said. "Last vcar, he would shoot,
but mavbe two or three times a game.
You come and watch out games now.
.uid he does not hesitate when lie's
shooting. He realh feels ili.it he can
make that shot, and he lias now become
one ol our biggest. strongest, most con
sistent weapons Irom the outside, and
that's been another aspect that we've
needed and will continue to need latei
on in the season.
M< Donald has also proven the d it its
wrong with his tight man-to-man de
fense tins season against some of the best
point guards in the nation.
In last I Imisd.iN s 7f>-7r> hoar (break
er (o No. S Ari/ona, lot example. Mc-
Donald contained Jason (iaidnei. the
Wildcais' talented point guard, to 2-of-7
shooting.
Now that Mt Donald has shown he
has the ahilit\ to compete against future
NBA st.n s like (iardner, the question re
mains il Mi Donald himself will test the
NIIA ranks once the season is ovci.
"I don't realh think about am ol that
stull. McDonald s.iid. "I'll think about
that stufl latei it it happens. But right
now. I'm )i Ist trving to tocus on winning
this tournament in a couple weeks."

Km ili.it doesn't inc.in M< Donald
li.isn't thought about his future.
"I'm either going to st.i\ next ve.n
.iiid co-term in |sociology] or go some
where and |>la \ |haskethall|." M< Donald
said. "Those are hasi<all\ ni\ two <>|)-

Wherever McDonald makes his

overlook him again.
