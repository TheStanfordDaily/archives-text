Frankl\. it has been a long
time without a < hampionship lot
the Stanford basketball team,
and the road to get to the nation

So how does a team make it to
the Final Four?
Mark Madsen and Artluu
Lee knew how in 1998.
After a regular season record
of ;l(the Cardinal made eas\
work of the College of
Charleston, Western Michigan
and Purdue before meeting
Rhode Island in the Klite Fight.
In that matchup, Stanford
trailed 70-74, with 33 seconds
remaining in the game, before
Lee drove the lane and made a
lavup. drawing a foul and mak
ing the free throw to cut the lead

to one. Oil ilit- inbounds pass.
Let* snipped the ball from I lie
Ranis' Cuttino Moblev, sending
the ball straight to Madsen.
Wliat ensued would be the
highlight of the tournament and
a clip shown even veai as part of
television broadcasts' attempt to
( apt tire the emotional essence of
the big I)ance.
Madsen slammed the ball
through the cylinder, drawing a
foul, to gi\e Stanford the lead. As
he landed, a sudden sin ge of pas
sion that onl\ the NCAA Tourna
ment (an provide overwhelmed
the sophomore. I le extended Ins
arms high to the sk\ in triumph,
waving them bat k and forth with
his mouth wide open — his red
mouth guard hiding his teeth
and veiling .it the top of his lungs.
Stanford won, 79-77, and made
the Final Four.
Simple process, huh?
Not really, considering
Stanford has onlv made the
Final Four twice in its entire lus
tor\. the first of whi< li o< ( urred
in 1942.
And.in that magical 1997-98
season, Stanford eventuallv lost
the semifinal game against Ken
tucky. plaved in San Antonio,
I ex. In front of 10,509 fans at the
Alamodomc and a bewildered
national television audience, the
Cardinal came out lighting
against the top-seeded Wildcats,
jetting out to a IH-3 lead in the
first five minutes,
Kentucky battled back to
wit hill five points at the half and
then took a three-point lead with
24.fi seconds remaining, before
Fee sent the game into overtime
with a I he Wildcats
overcame the Cardinal in the
extra session, but not In mm h, as
Kentucky advanced to the cham
pionship game with an 80-85
overtime victory.
After such a statement in
1998 ,ind with its high seeding
the p.ist two years, it seemed as if
Stanford was destined to make its
way back to the Final Four. In
stead. the Cardinal's two NCAA
appearances since then have
been less than memorable.
Fast year, as a No. I seed in
the South Regional, the Cardinal
made quick work of South Car
olina State in the first round, 84-
05. before hitting a road-block in
,i hot North Carolina team. I lic
"Far Heels took advantage of

Stanford's low field goal percent

Stanford's run two vears ago
also ( ame to an end in the second
round, when the No. 2 seeded
Cardinal lost to Con/aga. Fhe
No. 10 bulldogs out scored the
Cardinal, 18-8, in the final 7:1 I
to ice the game, winning, 82-71,
en route to then Cinderella run
to the Sweet 10.
1 he past two years have
shown that certain uncontrol
lable factors determine a team s
success in the tournament. Fast
year, the ( animal had the tough
task of, first, traveling across the
count! \ to Birmingham, Ala.,
where it had to adjust to the
change in time /ones, and, sec
ond. playing a team that was on
fin at that particular moment in
the season.
In both years, Stanford en
tered postseason pla\ with at
least a share of the Pacific 10
Conference title and failed to
make it to the Sweet 10. In fact,
be sides the 1998 Final l out run,
the Cardinal has onl\ reached
the Sweet 10 once in its history -
- in 1997.
In that year, Stanford was
ranked No. 0 in the West Re
gional when it took care of its
first-round opponent, Okla
homa. 80-07. Fhe Cardinal then
handled a tough No. 3 Wake For
est team in the second round,
beating the Demon Deacons, 72-
00, to reach the second weekend
of the tournament.
I lie (lardinal made a valiant
effort in its quest to reach the
I .lite Fight that year, pushing
No. 2 I tali into overtime before
losing, 82-77. in its third-round
game in San Jose.
Stanford failed to reach the
Sweet lit ill 1995 and 1996 .is
well. It lost in the second round
to the t niversity of Massachu
setts both times.
I he Cardinal faced I Mass,is
a No. 10 seed in 1995 after bare
ly sc raping by its first-round op
ponent, L'NC-Charlotte, 70-08.
Fhe win against Charlotte
marked Stanford's first postsea
son win since 1942. However,
the Minutenien outpaced the
Cardinal the entire wa\ in the
second round, winning the
game, 75-53.
