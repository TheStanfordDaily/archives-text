### MALCOLM LEVINE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Unlike the other power con
fercnccs, there was never much
doubt about which Pacific: 10
(lonference teams were going to
be in the NCCAA Tournament,
and. when the dust settled, five
fat-10 teams — Stanford, Ari
zona, UCCI.A, Southern (California
and California — received bids.
With the (Cardinal obtaining the
No. 1 seed in the West, the Pac-10's
second-place finisher, Arizona (23-

(Conference (herall
Team W L Pet. (d* W 1. Pet.
STANFORD 16 2 .889 — 28 2 .933
Arizona 15 3 .833 1 23 7 .707

Arizona State 5 13 .278 II 13 10 .448

7, 15-3 Pac-10), was shifted to the
Mklwrst as a No. 2 seed and given
a relatively easy draw.
The Wildcats start with a
first-round game against the
Ohio Valley Conference cham
pions, Eastern Illinois Universi
ty. EIU, after beating Austin
Peav in the OVG tournament fi
nals on a controversial goal
tending call, poses little threat
If) the Wildcats.
Arizona is lucky that it doesn't
have to face the more dangerous
Princeton or Holy Cross teams,

the No. 1 5 seeds in the South and
Fast, respectively.
Looking ahead to the second
round, the Wildcats could very
well be facing the No. 10 seed,
Butler, which has a great chance
of upsetting No. 7 seed Wake
Forest in the first round.
All bodes well fbi Arizona in
later rounds as well, because the
team has a likc-l\ Sweet 10 match
with the weakest No. 3 seed in
the tournament, Mississippi,
which was annihilated by Ken
tucky in the Southeastern (Con-

ference finals \ esterda).
Po .i(ld to then fortune, the
Wildcats' likcl\ foe m the I*.lite
Eight. N (>. I seed 111 i i K >is. I.k es a
hard road out of the Midwest le
gion. with diflit ult games against
such potential opponents as the
merc urial I'ennessee squad and
the ever dangerous Kansas |a\ -
hawks.
Needless to sav, the path to the
Final Font lies open in the Mid
west region, and Ai i/ona w ill most
certainh he man\ experts' pit k to
tome out on top as the \t >. 2 seed.

I lie Pac-lO's third-place
team, I CL\(2l-H, 14-4), coming
off a season-ending upset at the
hands of Washington, is being
sent out Hast as a No. 4 seed.
I lie Bruins probably slipped
down from a No. li seed with
their horrible loss on Saturday,
which could be \ iial. since now
the Bruins have a likely Sweet Hi
opponent in No. 1 seed Duke.
I fowever, the Bruins still have
to get past a' couple of feisty
squads before rea< lung tfie Sweet
Hi, beginning with first-round
opponent, I lofstra, wliit li comes
iiit<> the tournament with the na
tion's longest winning streak of
1S straight games.
I lie Pride, led by the America
Fast I'layei of the N eai Norman
Ri( hardson, in a b. lamed team
that c.m pi.in H> minutes of up
tempo basketball and should not
be taken lightly by the Bruins.
If the Bi urns do infact reach
the Sweet Hi, a matt hup with
Duke would be a (lassit. pitting
the heralded I ( 1A | >i ess against
a great ball-handling team in
Duke, led l>\ All-Aumtk an guard
|ason Williams.
Also sent Kast In the Selection
Committee was I S( 21-1), 11-7),
which received .i No. t> seed and
.i first-round meeting; with ()kla
lioina State.
I he sentimental fa vorite after
suffering through a tragic mid
season plane t rash, < )Sl might
not have deserved to get into the
tournament on basketball alone,
although it is considered one of
the bettei defensive it ams in the
country.
If ISC In nigs its A' game,
wlik li it has in >t d< me in ret c ut
weeks, the I rojans should not
have ninth trouble with a (low

boy team that is just too small to
contend with the Trojans down
low. If the Trojans get hot, they
could definitely make some noise
in the East with a potential sec
ond round game against the
overachieving Boston College
Kagles.
B.C. has played well all season,
especially in winning the Big Kast
tournament, but no one knows
when its bubble is going to burst.
With Brandon Cranville playing
a steady game at the point, the
I rojans have the ability to with
stand the Eagles' pressure and
make a surprise appearance in
the Sweet Hi.
The fifth fat-10 team in the
tournament, Cal (20-10, 11-7).
received the No. 8 seed in the
South and will play the Western
Athletic Conference regular sea
son champions, Fresno State, in
the first round.
After watching Cal through
out the season, it seems safe to
say that the Beats' tournament
hopes rest solely on the shoul
ders of star senior, Sean Lamp
ley, and it will be interesting to
see how he responds.
If ('.al wins its first-round game
and gets a chance to face No. I
seed Mil liigan State in the second
round, Lamplev would be on
center-stage for the first time in
his career and in perfect position
to advance his draft status.
As No. 1 seeds go, Michigan
State could be considered a little
inconsistent, especially coming
off'of its loss to Penn State iu the
Big 10 Tournament, so an upset
behind a big-time performance
by Lanipley is not tint of the
question.
1 he Bears would have to get
past a talented Fresno State team

til st, but anything is possible.
But, I.ample\ won't be able to do
it all on his own, so (lal will need
Shantav Legans to step up as well
in order to make its first trip to
the Kit; Dame since 1997 a mem
orable one.
With five teams in the Big
Dance, the l'ac-10 is in a perfect

position to reaffirm its status as
one of the top conteremes in the
nation. Both I'SC and C.al have
the stat power to pull off a few
upsets, while the Cardinal, Ari
zona and I ( f.A could all be ad
vancing to the Final Four, and
perhaps even crowned national
champions.
