# Men scorch Sun Devils
## 
### TIM KANE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Everywhere you looked, three lin
gers were in the air «it Maples Pavilion
Saturday afternoon.
From the players. From the fans.
And, after cutting down the net following
a 99-75 victory over Arizona State, even
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomerv
himself thrust his into the air, drawing an
appreciative roar from the crowd.
Winning three consecutive confer
ence titles brings out the best in evervone.
On Senior Day, No. 1 Stanford's three
elder statesmen — point guard Michael
McDonald and forwards Rvan Mentle/
and Jarron Collins — gave a great show
in their last game at Maples, scoring 12.
19 and 15 points, respectively, to turn
hack the Sun Devils. That left a lot of time
in the end to soak in the cheers and adu
lation of the last home crowd of their ca
reers on the Farm.
"It just feels so good to watch the
kids and the students and all the fans
just enjoy the whole thing so much,"
Montgomery said. "We're going to take
a big, deep breath now and enjoy this
day, but we'll get right back to practice
[Monday]."
Amidst the cheering and dancing af
terward, with the Sixth Man Club on the
court It) help in the celebration, there was
a whole lot of grinning going on among
the Stanford lineup.
"It's been a dream season for all of
us," Mendez said. "A lot of people think
this is the end of our career here at Stan
ford — but it's just the beginning be
cause we have a lot to prove in the com
ing weeks. We're re-energized, and
we're hungry."
That was especially true after losing
to Arizona on Thursday, and the Cardi
nal (28-2, 16-2 Pac-10) came out fired up
from the beginning, determined not to
let the Sun Devils (13-10, 5-13) stand in
the way of title No. 3.
Just like clockwork, the game plan
fc>r win No. 28 followed from the first 27
or so, i.e. dump the ball to the Collins
twins inside and let Casey Jacobscn shoot

the tights out from the outside. Led by Jacobsen's
4-for-5 shooting behind the 3-point arc, the Cardi
nal made 9-of-16 3-pointers while shooting 52 per
cent overall.
A 9-0 run and an 8-0 run in the first halt pret
ty much decided the outcome early on, and, be
hind 15 points from Jacobsen, the Cardinal held a
53*32 lead at the half, clearing the wav for the ova
lions and cheers that were to come.
"We were so focused," McDonald said. "I
didn't get caught up in the emotion of Senior Dav
— I mean, we have to come back to practice on
Monday, so it's not like I'm not going to shoot on
this court again."
As the seniors came off the floor following a
timeout with 1:21 left, Montgomery motioned for
the crowd to make noise for the three seniors, who

waved appreciatively at the fans and their family
members who were in attendance.
I lie crowd, though, didn't forget about acade
mic senioi Jason Collins, who would be on bis way
out from Maples if not for two vcars of injuries that
left him a rcdshirt sophomore. Chants of "One
more year!' came and went throughout the day as
Stanford fans made it clear that they would love to
see him stick around instead of opting for the N BA
draft.
Also, in .< footnote to bis impressive 19-point
performance, Mende/ broke the l'ac-10 and
school record for consecutive tree throws with his
42nd early in the second half. Ihe new record
didn't get extended for too long, as he c lanked an
attempt late in the second half that halted tlie
streak at 49.
