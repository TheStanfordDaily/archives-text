## Cardinal's 51-49 win clinches share of Pac-10 title 
### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
After tht- twists, turns, rises and drops that have
characterized the Stanford women's basketball
roller coaster conference season, things finalh
came to a 7.1-second halt on Saturday. And when
freshman Nicole Powell grabbed a key rebound
.md hit her first free throw .it the line, giving Stan
ford a 51-49 win over Arizona State and it's 10th
Pacific 10 Conference title, even head coach l ata
VanDerveer was a little surprised with the wav it
ended up.
"I made a sign for the team at the beginning of
the season, 'Pac-10 Champions, Number 10,'
VanDerveer said. "We had it in our locket room. 1
left it up after the losses to Arizona, Oregon and
Oregon State, but I took it down after the I SC
game. I even underestimated our own team."
It is hard to blame VanDerveer, whose team
shares the title with Washington and Arizona State,
.ill three teams posting a 1 '2-0 record in conference
play. Never before has a team won the Pac-10 title
with more than four losses.
Coming into this weekend, title chances looked
nearly hopeless, as the Huskies needed onl\ one
win over I SC or CCLA, the ninth and 10th teams
in the conference, to clinch the championship out
right.
However, as luck would have it. Washington
lost its Thursday game to the Women of Troy.
And with 0:21 to plav on Saturday, an announce
ment over the PA system of the Stanford-Arizona
State game declared the Huskies were down 58-
48 late in the second half, letting the Cardinal
know that the closing minutes were a battle for
first place.
Powell hit a 3-pointer with 3:20 remaining to
put the Cardinal up 48-43 with 3:20 left to plav.
Two Arizona State 3-pointcrs, with a basket In
Stanford junior Bethany Donaphin sandwiched
in-between, narrowed the score to 50-49 with 1 7.8
seconds remaining.
Arizona State had a chance for the win, but a
shot by Amanda Levens came up short. Powell
grabbed the rebound and was fouled, hitting her
first free throw to seal the win for Stanford.
"After the game, [Powell] was so relieved,"
Vanderveer said. "They double-teamed her, they
didn't want her coming in and taking it awav from

there."
Both teams played excellent man-to-man de
fense in the first half, limiting the offensive pro
duction of either squad. Stanford shot a meagei
.S7 percent, but the Sun Devils were held to 30
percent.
Arizona State junior Melody Johnson hurt the
Cardinal inside, as VanDerveer brought in many
players to defend her. While (i-foot-7 junior Corey
Enghusen and 0-0 senior Carolyn Moos did «i good
job on Johnson, the Sun Devils' leading scorer,
they each picked up two quirk fouls, limiting their
minutes on the floor.
Powell, a Phoenix native, seemed eager to im
press her hometown crowd, as .1 relatively large
Stanford contingent sported head bands similar to
the black Nike sweatband Powell has worn all sea
son. Arizona State's Natalie Tucker and Brett
Leonard worked hard on the Stanford freshman,
limiting her production throughout the first halt
and preventing her from touching the ball often,
let alone getting off a good shot.
Arizona State went into the half time break
leading 24-23.
1 he Sun Devils came out of the locker room
scorching, as Johnson took it to the hoop, scoring a
quick five points. Another foul on Moos forced the
senior to play with three fouls.
However, the Sun Devils' domination was
short-lived as Powell began to heat up, hitting nine
points within the next five minutes. The freshman
took advantage of her individual matchup with the
much smaller I ticker and was able to post up
strong inside.
Powell wasn t the only player posting up for
the Cardinal. Moos and Donaphin combined for
eight straight points inside to put the Cardinal
up, 42-36.
Donaphin tallied 10 points in the game, all in
the second half.
As far as I am concerned, those were her 10
biggest points for Stanford," VanDeerveer said. "She
stepped up big and worked very hard defensively."

Both teams played excellent man-to-man de
fense in the first half, limiting the offensive pro
duction of either squad. Stanford shot a meagei
.S7 percent, but the Sun Devils were held to 30
percent.
Arizona State junior Melody Johnson hurt the
Cardinal inside, as VanDerveer brought in many
players to defend her. While (i-foot-7 junior Corey
Enghusen and 0-0 senior Carolyn Moos did «i good
job on Johnson, the Sun Devils' leading scorer,
they each picked up two quirk fouls, limiting their
minutes on the floor.
Powell, a Phoenix native, seemed eager to im
press her hometown crowd, as .1 relatively large
Stanford contingent sported head bands similar to
the black Nike sweatband Powell has worn all sea
son. Arizona State's Natalie Tucker and Brett
Leonard worked hard on the Stanford freshman,
limiting her production throughout the first halt
and preventing her from touching the ball often,
let alone getting off a good shot.
Arizona State went into the half time break
leading 24-23.
1 he Sun Devils came out of the locker room
scorching, as Johnson took it to the hoop, scoring a
quick five points. Another foul on Moos forced the
senior to play with three fouls.
However, the Sun Devils' domination was
short-lived as Powell began to heat up, hitting nine
points within the next five minutes. The freshman
took advantage of her individual matchup with the
much smaller I ticker and was able to post up
strong inside.
Powell wasn t the only player posting up for
the Cardinal. Moos and Donaphin combined for
eight straight points inside to put the Cardinal
up, 42-36.
Donaphin tallied 10 points in the game, all in
the second half.
As far as I am concerned, those were her 10
biggest points for Stanford," VanDeerveer said. "She
stepped up big and worked very hard defensively."
Pac-10 rules give the automatic bid to Stanford
011 basis of the record against the conference's top
teams.
"This might be, out of all the Pac-10 champi
onships, the most satisfving one," VanDerveer
said.
After tht- twists, turns, rises and drops that have
characterized the Stanford women's basketball
roller coaster conference season, things finalh
came to a 7.1-second halt on Saturday. And when
freshman Nicole Powell grabbed a key rebound
.md hit her first free throw .it the line, giving Stan
ford a 51-49 win over Arizona State and it's 10th
Pacific 10 Conference title, even head coach l ata
VanDerveer was a little surprised with the wav it
ended up.
"I made a sign for the team at the beginning of
the season, 'Pac-10 Champions, Number 10,'
VanDerveer said. "We had it in our locket room. 1
left it up after the losses to Arizona, Oregon and
Oregon State, but I took it down after the I SC
game. I even underestimated our own team."
It is hard to blame VanDerveer, whose team
shares the title with Washington and Arizona State,
.ill three teams posting a 1 '2-0 record in conference
play. Never before has a team won the Pac-10 title
with more than four losses.
Coming into this weekend, title chances looked
nearly hopeless, as the Huskies needed onl\ one
win over I SC or CCLA, the ninth and 10th teams
in the conference, to clinch the championship out
right.
However, as luck would have it. Washington
lost its Thursday game to the Women of Troy.
And with 0:21 to plav on Saturday, an announce
ment over the PA system of the Stanford-Arizona
State game declared the Huskies were down 58-
48 late in the second half, letting the Cardinal
know that the closing minutes were a battle for
first place.
Powell hit a 3-pointer with 3:20 remaining to
put the Cardinal up 48-43 with 3:20 left to plav.
Two Arizona State 3-pointcrs, with a basket In
Stanford junior Bethany Donaphin sandwiched
in-between, narrowed the score to 50-49 with 1 7.8
seconds remaining.
Arizona State had a chance for the win, but a
shot by Amanda Levens came up short. Powell
grabbed the rebound and was fouled, hitting her
first free throw to seal the win for Stanford.
"After the game, [Powell] was so relieved,"
Vanderveer said. "They double-teamed her, they
didn't want her coming in and taking it awav from
