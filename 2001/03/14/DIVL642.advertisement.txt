Join us as we celebrate Women

eLeadership, Susan Annunzio.
A partner at Nextera, a leading
global management consultancy firm,
as well as a recognized authority
in the field of change management
and a sought after adviser to
senior corporate leaders around
the world, Annunzio takes you
beyond typical management speak
in eLeadership, offering a real
blueprint for dominating this
revolution. She shares the five
critical steps to heroic leadership
and shows how to bridge the gap
between the baby boomers and
the younger Generations X and Y
to create a more productive
working environment.
