1919
On March 14, 1919, T he Daily printed a
satirical article about c ampus beauties.
" '1 am positive that 1 am the most hand
some young lady amongst the 500. 1 here
are several that doubt my supremacy along
the beauty lines, so I hereby defy them with
.in open challenge to meet me in a beauty
contest.'
"The above is a copy of a challenge which
junior Miss Cutie Swenson wished the edi
tor of the Daily to make public, in an en
deavor to settle the long-disputed question
as to whether or not she was the beauty
queen of the campus.
"In.in interview with Miss Swenson, it
was ascertained that there were four other
beauties on the campus that claimed equal
honors with her. The most notable of these
is junior Miss 1,. W. Donkeysqueal, who was
once a dippy editor of a small-town paper.
"It was only after deep deliberation, and
much consideration, that Miss Swenson
gave out the names of the other candidates.
She thought that they were so homely tli.it
their names were not worth publication."
Bottom line: It looks like more than one campus
publication can print satire under The Daily's
masthead.
