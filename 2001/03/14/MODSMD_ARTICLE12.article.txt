U
Historian Marilyn Yalom has
forged a career out of explorations of
topics so obvious they go unnoticed.
In 1997, she published "A History of
the Breast," a lively analysis of society's
obsession with the female anatomy.
Now the senior scholar at the Insti
tute for Women and Clender at Stan
ford University has written k M History
of the Wife."
"A History of the Wife " emerged
from research for the "Breast" book,
Yalom said.
But her interest also grew from per
sonal history. "I've been concerned
about the problematic nature of mar
riage in our timesaid Yalom, 68, who
has been married for 46 years. "/ have
four grown-up children. I've watched
them marry and stay married; there's
one divorce. I'm very concerned about
what it is to be a wife today."
