After interviews and a set its of stunts
involving handguns, tight ropes and
pumpkins, freshman Chuck Armstrong
was named as the free tor the 2001 -2002

The Stanford Tree lias come to be one
of the most visible representatives of the
University. In fact, the Tree probably
gets more time on television than any
other Stanford i onununits member. As a
result, the selection of the I ree is an an
nual event that brings out cra/\ stunts
.nul courageous students.
In order to become the l'ree, Ann
strong, like all serious candidates, under
went a series of daring stunts, pushing
the envelope to inventive lengths not
seen in a long time.
()ne of these stunts consisted ot Arm
strong touching down next to the Band
Shak in a spotlight police helicopter and
jumping out in what he called "storm
trooper gear."
He also tight roped across the Main
Quad, balanc ing himself while dodging
clumps of dirt that were being thrown at
him by spec tators.
Although candidates are discouraged
from using tire in anv ot their stunts,
Armstrong safely employed fire before
the first informational meeting. There,
he set up a wall of tire on the lawn outside
of the Band Shak and ptc weeded to walk
through it with the Dollies.
In perhaps the most shocking simit.

Armstrong dug himself .1 hole under
ground. After rising from underground
through .1 hollowed-out pumpkin, Arm
strong was shot in the 1 hest In .1 .38 i al
iber handgun. Of course, he took the
neeessarv safet\ precautions, .is he was
wealing .1 bulletproof \esi undci his

pumpkin costume.
"We were ver\ impressed with
Chuck's trvout ... It was clear he was .1
risk-seeking candidate." said senioi Evan

1999-00 year.
However, what set Armstrong apart
was not his stunts, but his interview, ac
cording to the current Tree, senior Alex
Newell.
"His stunts were awesome, and he
showed that lie was cra/.v enough. But,
in the interview . . . he really impressed
the religious members [of the selection
committee], Newell said.
"Each vear, the band has a ditlereut
focus for what they need from the I ree,
since it is the leader of the band," Newell
continued.

She said that, her year, the Band
needed someone who was .1 little bit < ra
/ier. I fowever, this vear, the band need
ed more of a spiritual leader, and it was
clear that Armstrong fit this mold.
" lYees, 1 feel, are a very spiritual part
of nature," Armstrong said.
I le said that his desire to become 112 rec
originated from his birthplace in Seattle.
"There are a lot of trees in Seattle, so I
always felt like I belonged with the trees,"
Armstrong said." I .ilso think that it will be
fun to represent the school as the free."
For Meagher and Newell, the experi
ence is one that li.is been unparalleled by
anything cist- that thev have done .it
Stanford. Meagher got to go to manv
spotting events, including the Rose
Bowl.

"I was (lie first Rose Bowl live ever,"
Meagher said.
Newell agreed with Meagher that
being the Tree was something that she
wished she could do again.
"It is the (oolest thing I have done .it
Stanford. It is the ultimate Stanford ex
perience ... and a fantastic wa\ to spend
a \ear and meet so manv people," she
said.
Armstrong was grateful to Ins friends
who helped him in being selrc ted .is next
year's Tree.
"My dorm (Alondra) was really sup
portive," he said.
As for Armstrong's plans for Ins
tenure .is 1 ree. he is soinewhat see relive.
"1 have one word for you as a teaser
for next vear," he s.iid. "I'ineKones!"
