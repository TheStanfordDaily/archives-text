Keaslcv. is impractical, even based solely upon
the disciplines that the the new department
will include.
lor instance, the department will handle
Romance and Asian languages, die literature
in ea< li ol these languages and ( ultural ( lasses
specjfit to these regions and languages. While,
idininistrativelv, a merger of this sort mav
seem appe.iling, the liclty ambition ol 'consoli
dation seems to cndangei the integrity of eacli

of these areas of study.
Larger departments, such as the Political
Science and Economics Departments, can
often seem intimidating and impersonal. I he
larger a department is, the more ambiguous
and vast the area of study within that depart
ment becomes.
Smaller departments attract students be
cause many say the focused departments bet
ter accommodate their academic interests. In
addition, smaller departments can also oiler a
greater amount of individual attention and
guidance to students.
The proposed Literatures, Cultures, and
Languages Department, though, would have
the bureaucracy ol other larger departments,
•is well as prevent the flexibility and academic
creativity th.it smaller departments can oiler to
students.
Internal conflicts betyveen areas of study
may also surface yvhen all of these incredibly
diverse and distinct departments are pulled
together. For instance, competition for re
sources could arise. Not .ill of the depart
ments included in this merger have the same
size demands.
For example, the Spanish and Portuguese
Department has over twice as many faculty
members as the Slavic Studies Department.
Fhe needs of larger departments could domi

nate the needs of smaller departments and
prevent the growth of certain areas of study, as
well as negatively ailed the morale of those
studying these areas.
It is also important to recognize the ideo
logical diflerences that exist between different
areas of study, especialh when these areas of
stuch are related to notions of culture and aes
thetics. I low is it possible to evaluate doctoral
candidates or to determine the quality of work
within this "mega-department" when each of
these departments defines its needs so differ
ently? I lie definition of good academic woi k
is not .m absolute. Departments involved in
the merger, which emphasize different lan
guages and cultures, have distinct notions of
what is "valuable" and "challenging" in the
academic world.
For example, the academic values and work
of the Kastern cultures will differ substantially
from the Kuro-centric Romance cultures. Ideo
logical distinctions like these necessitate separate
departments for each of these areas of study.
I he consolidation suggests that it is possible
to represent .ill of these inc redibl\ distinct and
sometimes ideologicall\ opposed departments
with one loud voice. While the merger max
create a larger and more powerful depart
ment, this does not necessarih mean that the
individual areas of stiul\ within the depart

ment will benefit from this increased collective
influence.
Indeed, the distinct philosophies of each
area of studv w ill have to he diluted and com
promised in order to create a cohesive ideolo
gy for the larger department. These smaller
areas of studv will have to forfeit their autono
in\ and compromise ideological distinctions
to meld into a larger department, hindering
distinct development in individual areas of
study.
II the I niversit\ truly wants these smaller
departments to flourish, then, instead of forc
ing them to combine into a larger and more
ambiguous department, the University should
simply give each department the resources it
needs to thrive. (iive the departments the op
portunity to hire more faculty, to develop more
intense academic programming and to form
interdepartmental programs.
I niversitv President John Uennessy came
into office expressing a commitment to the
humanities. This consolidation proposal chal
lenges that pledge. Rather than encouraging
the development of the humanities, this merg
er inhibits expansion by combining the dis
tinct needs and intricacies of each of these
areas of study into one large department, and,
consequently, neglects to give any of them the
respect it is due.
