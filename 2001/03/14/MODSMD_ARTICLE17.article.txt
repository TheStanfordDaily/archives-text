# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Seniors: What next? 
### 
Omi (I.iic of graduation aj>-
proai lies. And appro,x lies,
•uid appi oa( lu s. until it's
pervading even moment

of oiu davs. Seniors,
\ou used i<> laugh and
joke and meet new
people at 11111 (h. Now
von're brooding
alone, thinking,
"W hat next?"
You used to go out
on weekends, to a fi at
part\. to Mi\ .ike. to

the t it\ (okav, rarelv), tint now von
di ink (oHee on I rid.n nights and stare
at the |obtrak listings. W hat next?
11 all the dav, nearh evervone 1 know
- except the future 1-bankers, who in
terviewed in November, and the co
tei in ( i owd — c an be observed walking
the ( ainpus like /omhics or staring at
theii monitors in silence, in shock,
thinking, "What next?"
Is ibis how it should be? ()r are we
doing this to oui selves? You know, ibis
torturous apprehension might be en
tireb in our heads. Perhaps for vears
we've been setting ourselves up to spend
the fiisi half Of -001 in a life-t rushing,
maso( liistic state of IM.itonii angst.
I'm sure all of us experienced the
tc.ii and loathing of applving to col
leges. waiting for those packets to ar
rive. fearing thin envelopes, and
(earing our peers, our parents and
oui sel\ es.
Hut, then, it was never really a
question of what next, but only of
where next. We were panicking over
an uncerlaint\ that onl\ marginally
existed.
Sure, it was nuclear which college
we would attend, but it was deal that
the next four years would be college
vcais. Right now, the idea of apphing
to ( ollege seems like the most (omfort
able thing in the world. You get in
somewhere and bang — no major
lifestyle changes for four years.

Wouldn't that be nice today? For those
applying to law, medical, business or
graduate s< liool, relish in your relative
stability!
Hut tor those of us who are over
whelmed l>\ the possibilities, the (jues
tion remains, what next? For example,
I'd like to work fora couple of years as
a technical writer, legal assistant, mar
keter. fundraiser. I'd love to do some
acting.
I know I'll always write, and maybe
somedax make a living at it. In a cou
|)le vears, perhaps law or business
school, jierhaps an Fnglish doctorate,
|>erhaps an acting conservatory or cre
ative writing.
I'd like to live in the Hay Area, in
Chicago, New York, Boston, Atlanta.
W ashington, mavbe London. However,
like main seniors. 1 don't know where
to begin.
I have to remind myself that, as the
poet Rumi says, "There are hundreds
of wa\ s to kneel and kiss the ground —
to live!" Yet I walk on through the day
with that quintessential question of
(li.inge pestering me — what next?
I he thing that I'm realizing is that
you can't face the whole question of
your future at once; you need to
break it down and ask simple ques
tions. like where you would like to live
next year.,
Which possibility most excites you
now? Because if there's one thing of
which we can be certain, it's that we are
yen voting. And with this youth comes
.i vital and awe-inspiring {possibility for
change.
If you start out in one city and get
bored, von can move. If you start out in
one job and despise it, you can cross it
off your list and pick something else —
something that does excite you, that
makes vou feel alive! As long as you're
open to change, you'll be getting busy
living (as the movie"Shawshank Re
demption" told us).
I oday I'm a student, and I love it. In a

few months. I'll he something else, and it
1 don't love it, I'll change it. As long as it's
a move toward something von love more,
change is good.

As Rnmi says, "Today, like every
other day, we wake lip emptv / and
frightened. Don't open the door to the
stud\ and begin reading. lake down a
musical instrument. Let the beautv we
love be what we do." Sound, revolution
ary advice; it you're emptv and scared,
change to do something von love even
more.

For .ill <>t us seniors, thinking this
way might in itself be an enormous
change, and 1 think it'll make all the
other changes a little easier to weather.
