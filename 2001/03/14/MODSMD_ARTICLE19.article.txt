Students are 'rational decision makers'
I «un writing to commend Peter Stair's
excellent sermon in rhursdav s paper
("Students not immune to problems ot
'normal' people"). Although Stan lias in
spired me to change inv wavs,
many others will continue theii stressful,
sleep-deprived lives despite lus statistics.
I, too. required some convincing. I mil
the column last week. 1 viewed Stanford
as an investment made possible b\ some
one else's generosity. 1 took main c lasses
and studied hard because I wanted to. \l\
family's money and effort was at stake-,
and 1 believed th.it behaving otherwise
was unethical. 1 preferred hanging out
with friends to the eight hours of sleep 1
require and enjoyed my athletic activities
enough to shorten my sojourn in bed. I
was even optimistic regarding mv future
career and
possible marriage. I was happv in mv
sleep-debted stupor.

I nfortunatcly. main Stanford stu
dents will c hoose to rem.tin in this stupor
despite wai nings from Sleep and Dreams,
Mom and Stair. Stanford students are ra
tional dec ision makers who are aware of
the sacrifices involved in choosing work,
fun and friends over sleep. I admire them
lot theii decision and wish them success,
good health and happiness.

I was appalled during last weekend
basketball game between the University
of Arizona and Stanford to hear Steve
Physioc express his shock .it the disgust
ing comments from the Stanford student
body regarding Michael Wright's SAT
scores. This young man's escape from
inner citv Chicago is well known. He has
comported himself academically and so

i iallv in the most admirable manner.
I he abuse of this fine person by Stanford
students is reprehensible. I always

you are not the bastion of integrity you

In response to TQ Shang's March 8
column on curtailing expression ("In

point of college besides the exchange of
ideas in .111 academic atmosphere? 1 his

to talk for the sheer pleasure of hearing
their cm 11 voices, but it seems foolish to re

peers.

basketball game between the University
of Arizona and Stanford to hear Steve
Physioc express his shock .it the disgust
ing comments from the Stanford student
body regarding Michael Wright's SAT
scores. This young man's escape from
inner citv Chicago is well known. He has
comported himself academically and so

i iallv in the most admirable manner.
I he abuse of this fine person by Stanford
students is reprehensible. I always
thought that Stanford c hose the elite, the
future leaders of our country. 1 believe
you are not the bastion of integrity you
pretend to be. 1 would use other words to
characterize your students: intolerant, in
sensitive. arrogant, ignorant and bigoted.
1 am very, very disappointed with your
school. Shame on von.

Look elsewhere for the truth
In response to TQ Shang's March 8
column on curtailing expression ("In
search of the truth"), I think that he
should march himself to the Bursar s of
fice and demand a refund on his tuition.
tor he hasobviousb derived nothing I'rom
his experience at Stanford. What is the
point of college besides the exchange of
ideas in .111 academic atmosphere? 1 his
isn't to s.i\ that we .ill should enjo\ enclui -
ing those people in our sec lions who seem
to talk for the sheer pleasure of hearing
their cm 11 voices, but it seems foolish to re
ject the opinions of 'others whom the acl
missions board views .is our intellectual
peers.
II you are seeking the absolute truth,
go attend .1 religious .service of vour
c hoosing, bee ausc no one else is going to
profess to possess it. Win bothei to bring
so main capable minds to one loc .ition it
miu refuse to benefit from theii interac
tion. II vou want the unadulterated
opinions of .1 college professor, I'm sure
the Stanford Bookstore can point vou to
tens of thousands of sources of such stat
ii inform.iiion. It vou go into 1 l.iss ex
pecting .1 sermon from the mount, vou
have alreaclx closed vour mind to ideas

vou ma\ have nevei thought of on your

truth is through deliberation with others,
and. if you halt that, vou might as well halt
human progress altogether. But if all you
want to do is meet a professor, they all
ha\e oflic e hours and most of them don't
mind having a conversation with a stu
dent, provided that student doesn't
whine about bis or her teat methods.
Stanford is not a means to an end, but a
rich learning experience in itself th.it
shouldn't be taken for granted. But,
Irankh. 1 don't even know whv I'm reply
