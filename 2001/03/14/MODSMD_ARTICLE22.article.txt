Batykyan said he wants help so that he can. in turn,
help others around him. Anne Peterson, the program
coordinator of the Disability Resource ( .enter who

"The disability is not the defining focus of
Batvkvan's life," Peterson said. "He has not required
much use of the DRC.'s resources. He does not con
sider himself to be- disabled."
Despite his positive attitude, the courses of treat
ment have been expensive; to date, the cost of his lat
est treatment at the M.l). Anderson Medical Center
has exc c eded $70,000 in medical and related expens
