the University of Paris.
(irenier was the latest speaker in the ongoing
Robert Mofstadter Memorial 1 .enure Series,
named in'honor of the late Nobel I'ri/e-w inning
Stanford phvsicist who demonstrated that the
proton and the neutron were non-point pani
cles, a significant advance in phvsics.
(irenier's lecture, entitled "New Views of a
Vibrant Universe," addressed the advances

made in the field of astronoim thanks to tele
scopes that can detect w.ives bevond the realm
ol human sight. I lofstadter was a pioueci ol this
te(hnolog\ and helped oversee the develop
ment of the Knergetic (i.imma Rax I xperiment
Iciest ope.
(Irenier took a colorful, multimedia ap
proach to the topic. She begati In disc ussing the
vast spectrum of waves and the rclativeh tin\
portion of such waves \ lsilile to rhe human eve.
She showed a picture of the sun seen under
normal conditions and a similat photo taken
with an \-ra\ light-sensitive telescope. In the
second photo, the corona and hot winds that
surround the sun were \ isible. I lie third photo,
showing the sun with an instrument capable ol
detecting (iamm.i ravs, revealed more prcvi
oush invisible phenomena.

(•renin continued this pattern, discussing
more exotic interstellar bodies, such as super
novas. a black holes, a constellation known as the
(iould Belt and a collision Ix'tween two stai s.
She interspersed the discussion with colorful
allusions, comparing the relative rates of dec a\
of two stars to I.a Fontaine's storv," Ihe Ant and
the (ir.isshoppei." She also described the even
tual collision of the \lilk\ Wa\ with the An
dromeda gal.ixv as "romantic."
"|'The lecture] was reallv fun and imagina
tive," s.iid Si.\(. h-of. Ru hard I avlor. "It was in
teresting to see how different the sk\ looked. In
astronomy, there is a tendency to show pictures
Ix'cause of the colorful nature of the science."
"I found it ven interesting," said \ eronic|ue
