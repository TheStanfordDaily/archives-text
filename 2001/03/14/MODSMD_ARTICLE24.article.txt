# Board reviews new cancer center plan
## 
### CHRISTINA HA 
I he Palo Alto Architectural
Revicu Hoard assessed a propos
al to build a new cancer center
neai the Stanford Hospital 011
March I. Located between the
Lucille Packard Children's Hos
pital and the Blake Wilbur ('.en
tn. the planned font-story build
ing would fulfill multiple objec
tives. including bringing cancer
treatment procedures under one
root.
"The cancer center will in
crease ambulatory services tor
outpatient surgen. loosen up ex
isting space in the crowded hos
pital and mainlv consolidate can
cer senites that are now scat
tered throughout the hospital,"
said Stanford 1 fospital Vice Pres
ident Louis Saksen.
I le said outpatient services are
becoming more popular, and the
current 12 outpatient surgen
rooms are too small and situated
in a stone building constructed in
1959. The proposed cancer cen
ter would replace these outdated
rooms with l(i state-of-the-art
outpatient surgeries.
Presently, patients must be
transported from building to
building for Stanford Medical

('.niter's world-renowned cancer
services. With the new cancer
center, cancer patients need onlv
come to one place tor more elec
tive and organized treatment.
\ positive patient mindset is
( nicial to treatment, Saksen said,
and the cancer center will also
provide an aesthetically pleasing
environment to achieve this end.
I lie new building will be very
attractive — full of sunlight —
and exterior light will come .ill
the way from the third floor to
the basement," Saksen said.
"Plans include gardens, and the
center will be surrounded bv
green space, allowing [the build
ing] to fit into its surroundings."
Asian-style gardens will be ac
cented with water, possibly in the
form of fountains and ponds.
Hie cancer center itself will be a
light rose color with metallic ma
terial above to reflect light.
Hie main concerns about the
cancer center plans at the Archi
tectural Review Hoard session
dealt with traffic congestion and
parking, but the designs include
a tour-level underground park
ing structure below Pasteur
Drive. 1 he Palo Alto C.itv Council
had already approved the pro
posed cancer center last July.
