"They are our untouchables," saici
Sunny Chandonais of the mentally ill.
"We don't want to talk about them; we
want to protect our children from
them."
Chandonais, the mother of Patrick
(".offer, a 32-vear-old schizophrenic
man who has suffered with the illness
for 10 years, was among the five pan
elists who spoke as part of human biol
ogy lecturer Dr. William Hurlbut's
Human Biology 2S: "Bioethical Issues
in Human Biology" class last night.
The panel, titled "Mind, Matter and
Mental Illness," was organized In
sophomore Farnaz Alemi.
Coffer, who graduated from UC-
Berkeley with .1 double major in envi
ronmental toxicology and physiology,
had his first psychotic break when he
was a junior, according to ('handonais.
"He was about 20 or 21 ... When
the doctor at the medical center told
me, 1 didn't listen. I didn't take it seri
ously and he wasn't living at home, so
1 wasn't able to watch lus deterioration
of personality traits," she savs, al
though friends recalled him telling
them that lie had schizophrenia.
Coffer managed to graduate and at

tend three vears of medical * hool, de
spite his untreated illness, before he
was asked to leave.
Since his diagnosis. Coffer has been
in and out of hospitals and has had .1
spottv history of self-medication. De
spite lus illness, he continues to studv
neurobiology at a nearby library.
"They don't lose their intelligence;
they just lose their common sense,"
('.handonais said.
('.offer is one of 3.5 million Ameri
cans, or approximately 2 percent of
the population of the I nited States,
who suffei from a severe mental illness
such as schizophrenia or bipolar disor
der, according to Hurlbut.
"[The thing that is| challenging
about mental illness is that it affects the
central mechanism of the human dif
ference, the mental and moral unique
ness th.it constitutes our species'
adaptability," Hurlbut said. "So along
with mental illness come all the ques
tions of where it comes from,
and ... it may be that the human neu
rological difference is also what makes
11s vulnerable to mental illness."
Mental illness refers to various dis
abilities. but the panel yesterda\ fo
cused 011 one <>l the more severe men
tal illnesses: schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia devastates the pa

tient's ability to exercise this "neuro
logical difference," according to Assoc.
Prof, of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sci
ences Judith Ford and psychiatry re
search fellow Dr. Jennifer Keller, Ford
and Keller, who work at the Palo Alto
Veterans Affairs Medical ('.enter, both
participated in yesterday's panel.
"Schizophrenia is a serious brain
disorder resulting in a break with real
ity," Ford said. It is also "an unfortu
nate culmination of several factors."
"One of the facts that we love, be
cause it allows us to argue both sides of
the coin, is that if you are an identic al
twin and your identical twin has schiz
ophrenia, there is a 50 percent chance
that vou will also develop schizophre
nia," Ford said. "That fact is both used
as an argument that ii is genetic and
that it is not. 11 it were genetic, it would
be 100 percent and it ii were not, it
would be 1 percent."
Keller said that the disease, while it
mav be genetic, is influenced In other
psvc ho-soc ial fac tors and environmental
stresses. I'he death ot the % primar\ care
giver, for instance, mav provoke an
episc >de.
According to Aletni, this is the first
year that there has been a panel on
mental illness in the bioethics
class. She was inspired to orga
nize the session after she com
pleted a sophomore seminal ti
tled "I'svchosis and Society," co
taught l>\ Ford and Keller.
"I was align every time 1 left
the seminal." Alcnii said. "It was
the first time .1 ( lass .it Stanford
got to 111 c. I w as upset a I how our
society is disregarding menial
health in general."

Sunny agreed. "I hope (the
si iiclcut s who all end the lee turc)
will become aware of what a lor
gotten segment ol societ\ the
mentallv ill are and how much
we need reform," she sa\s. "We
need rcfoi in in the laws, we need
reform m support services."
\iki Cilbert, a woman who
has struggled with schizophre
nia since 1985— and who did
not rcgularb receive treatment
until 1998 — also spoke on the
panel.
Cilbert, unlike some schizo
phrenics, suffered a sudden
onset of the illness.

"One (lav. I started feeling
pat.moid that 1 was going t<>
die. 1 told tn\ latnil\ that 1 was
going to die .... About a week
later I had an experience that
lel t like death, and when 1 woke
up, 1 heard voices and began
having teligious delusions."
(filbert said.
I he voi< cs in her head told
(•illicit that, it she found |esus,
she would be released Iroin the
torment ol the void's in her
head. ()ne da\. while (iilbert was
riding on BAR! in San I ran< is
co, a ( ouple got on wit ha bain.
"Mv head told me that the

bain was |rsus and 1 had to take
it." (iilbert said.
She ti ied to take the babv and
was pursued In the police until
she called bet father, who bailed
her out ot jail.
(iilbert. like nianv m liizo
phreni( people, did not want to
believe that she had a mental ill
ness and refused treatment until
she began to neglect her son, an
experience which brought tears
to her eves as she spoke of it.
Neat l\ cvcr\ one will be
tout lied In m hi/ophi cilia, .it
least through a relative ot a
friend, according to Dr. Keller,

and i! is therefore important that
students become aware of the is
sues involved with mental illness.
" I here at e two images operat
ing at once in t lie field of mental
illness," Ilnrlbnt s.iid. " I lie first
is .1 top-down perspective which
sees ideas, social construction,
personal identity. social and psy
chological realities playing a
role.' He said the second is a bot
tom-up apptoac li tli.it lotuses on
genetic ( auscs ol st hi/ophrenia.
"Mental illness is a huge terri
tor\ ol medi( ine remaining
largely unexplored and unex
amined with a tremendous op

portune for the brilliant minds
like those of Stanford students to
make discoveries that w ill have a
huge inipat t on the suffering of
humanity," he said.
Issues of privacy, stigma, dis
crimination and shame related
to mental illness were part ol the
territory of yesterday's panel
and dis< ussion. ()ther topic s cov
ered were ethics of involuntary
medication foi patients who can
not make judgments for them
selves and the discrepancy in
tost between older, side-eflect
ridden drugs and newer, more
effective drugs.
