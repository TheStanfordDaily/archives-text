"They are our untouchables," saici
Sunny Chandonais of the mentally ill.
"We don't want to talk about them; we
want to protect our children from
them."
Chandonais, the mother of Patrick
(".offer, a 32-vear-old schizophrenic
man who has suffered with the illness
for 10 years, was among the five pan
elists who spoke as part of human biol
ogy lecturer Dr. William Hurlbut's
Human Biology 2S: "Bioethical Issues
in Human Biology" class last night.
The panel, titled "Mind, Matter and
Mental Illness," was organized In
sophomore Farnaz Alemi.
Coffer, who graduated from UC-
Berkeley with .1 double major in envi
ronmental toxicology and physiology,
had his first psychotic break when he
was a junior, according to ('handonais.
"He was about 20 or 21 ... When
the doctor at the medical center told
me, 1 didn't listen. I didn't take it seri
ously and he wasn't living at home, so
1 wasn't able to watch lus deterioration
of personality traits," she savs, al
though friends recalled him telling
them that lie had schizophrenia.
Coffer managed to graduate and at

tend three vears of medical * hool, de
spite his untreated illness, before he
was asked to leave.
Since his diagnosis. Coffer has been
in and out of hospitals and has had .1
spottv history of self-medication. De
spite lus illness, he continues to studv
neurobiology at a nearby library.
"They don't lose their intelligence;
they just lose their common sense,"
('.handonais said.
('.offer is one of 3.5 million Ameri
cans, or approximately 2 percent of
the population of the I nited States,
who suffei from a severe mental illness
such as schizophrenia or bipolar disor
der, according to Hurlbut.
"[The thing that is| challenging
about mental illness is that it affects the
central mechanism of the human dif
ference, the mental and moral unique
ness th.it constitutes our species'
adaptability," Hurlbut said. "So along
with mental illness come all the ques
tions of where it comes from,
and ... it may be that the human neu
rological difference is also what makes
11s vulnerable to mental illness."
Mental illness refers to various dis
abilities. but the panel yesterda\ fo
cused 011 one <>l the more severe men
tal illnesses: schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia devastates the pa

tient's ability to exercise this "neuro
logical difference," according to Assoc.
Prof, of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sci
ences Judith Ford and psychiatry re
search fellow Dr. Jennifer Keller, Ford
and Keller, who work at the Palo Alto
Veterans Affairs Medical ('.enter, both
participated in yesterday's panel.
"Schizophrenia is a serious brain
disorder resulting in a break with real
ity," Ford said. It is also "an unfortu
nate culmination of several factors."
"One of the facts that we love, be
cause it allows us to argue both sides of
the coin, is that if you are an identic al
twin and your identical twin has schiz
ophrenia, there is a 50 percent chance
that vou will also develop schizophre
nia," Ford said. "That fact is both used
as an argument that ii is genetic and
that it is not. 11 it were genetic, it would
be 100 percent and it ii were not, it
would be 1 percent."
Keller said that the disease, while it
mav be genetic, is influenced In other
psvc ho-soc ial fac tors and environmental
stresses. I'he death ot the % primar\ care
giver, for instance, mav provoke an
episc >de.
