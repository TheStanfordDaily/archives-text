# Bush nixes regulation of many C02 emissions
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Bac king off a
campaign pledge, President George W.
Bush is telling Congress he will not regu
late carbon dioxide emissions from power
plants.
The decision, outlined in a letter being
sent to Republican senator yesterday,
was a blow to conservationists who see
curbing emissions of such "greenhouse
gases'* as kev to reducing global warming.
lhe letter cites skyrocketing energy
costs, particularly in the West, as one rea
son for Bush's about-face, according to
(i( )P sources in (Congress and the admin
istration who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
Bush promised in the campaign to
treat carbon dioxide emissions as pollu
tants, and Christie Whitman, his Hnvi
ronmental Protection Agency adminis
trator, said last month that the adminis
tration was strongly considering such
regulations.
Vice President Dick Cheney told a
weekly policy gathering with senators
that (lie administration was preparing a
letter that would sav carbon dioxide was
not a pollutant, said one otficial on (Capi
tol I lill. The lettei was being sent to Sen.
('hue k I lagel. R-Neb. vesterdav, saicl an
administration official briefed on the
letter.
Bush pledged during his presidential
campaign to require electric utilities to
"reduce emissions and significantly im
prove air quality." 1 he legislation Bush
proposed would have established
"maudaton reduction targets tor emis
sions of tout main pollutants: sulfur diox
ide, nitrogen oxide, mercury and carbon
dioxide."
I lie letter to I lagel said Bush is com
mitted to a balanced energy policy that
improves air quality In curbing nitrogen
oxide, sultiii dioxide and mercury but
that Bush no longer believes the govern
ment should impose mandatory emis
sions caps on c arbon dioxide.
Kxplaining the shift. Bush noted that
the ( lean Ah Act does not include c arbon
dioxide as a pollutant. Bush aides saicl

thevdid not rcali/e there was a contradic -
tion when the president's energy policy
was released during the campaign.
The White House also is citing a De
cember study bv the Department of En
ergy that said regulating carbon dioxide
would lead to higher electricity prices,
particularly in the hard-hit West.
Hush's energy task force, chaired bv
Cheney, is trying to develop a national
energy policy.
Carbon dioxide is emitted whenever
fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas are
burned. It also is found in evervday prod
ucts such as cola and is emitted when peo
ple breathe.
Bush lias argued that the nation's en
ergy woes can largelv be addressed bv
tapping domestic supplies of coal and
natural gas.
1 he Bush administration has been lob
bied aggressiveh by energy industry offi
cials who vehemently oppose regulating
c arbon dioxide. I hey contend it does not
lead to global warming.
In the campaign, Bush said he would
move to "phase in the reductions" of all
four products "over a reasonable time pe
riod." ( lieney said the c ampaign position
was in error.
He told senators that Whitman was
being "a good soldier" in repeating the
c ampaign pledge.
Whitman s.iici last month that Bush
recognizes the importance of the chal
lenges posed In c Innate change, a subject
she saicl has been discussed as part of the
administration's emerging energy plan.
"There's no question bin that global
warming is a real phenomenon, that it is
occurring," Whitman saicl after a Senate
hearing on other environmental issues.
Bush pledged in the letter to continue
seeking ways to reduce global warming
through market incentives and other
techniques.
As a possible response to global warm
ing, Whitman raised the possibility of the
administration supporting legislation
tli.it would for the first time regulate car
bon emissions.
