is its bench plav.
"We're going to need perfor
mances off the bench," Mont

want to have the bench be a deal
where I'm substituting to rest peo

gain something — mavbe a little
quickness, mavbe a gu\ makes
some shots that the guv he went in
for was not making."
One (Cardinal that Mont
gotnen will definitely need to
come off the bene h in the tourna

Justin Davis. With sophomore

critical role of backing up t lie

With Davis out, freshman for

significant minutes off the bench.

"[Stanford] is a team that rebounds

"Very well" is an understatement
of Stanford's shooting ability lately.
