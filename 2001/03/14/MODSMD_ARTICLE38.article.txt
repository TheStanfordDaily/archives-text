# George Washington has women talkin' revolution

### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
After all the uncertainty, the in
juries and the ups and downs of
flu- conference season, the Stan
ford women's basketball team fi
nally gets to concentrate on the
thing it does best: playing basket
ball.
A No. 10 seed in the West re
gion, the Cardinal already has a
shared Pacific 10 Conference title
on its resume, and a strong run in
the NCAA Tournament would
largely erase the frustrations that
have plagued the team all season.
"For us to win our 10th Pac-10
championship with this team, for
me it's the most satisfying Pac-10
championship in that it was the
hardest fought," head coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "1 am very
proud of how our team did. 1 am
very excited for our team in the
tournament."
The Cardinal, in it's 14th tour
nament appearance, is slated to
take on No. 7 seed George Wash
ington in the tournament's first
round in Norman, Okla. The
game will be broadcast starting at
7:07 p.m. on ESPN 2 on March 17.
While Norman seems a long
way from home, and George
Washington seems worlds away
from Stanford's familiar Pac-10
opponents, the Cardinal is a little
more comfortable with the situa
tion than one might expect.
rhe Cardinal played at Univer
sity of Oklahoma on Dec. 27, suf
fering a 102-9K overtime defeat.
While the hard-fought game was a
good indicator of Stanford's ability
to stay with some of the nation's
top teams, the lesson was bitter
sweet, not only because of the loss,
but because point guard Susan
King was injured with a minute
remaining in the first half, sidelin
ing her for the rest of the season.
However, while the return to
()klahoma brings mixed emotions
to the Cardinal squad, one Stan
ford player is very happy about

the choice of setting. Senior Sarah
Dimson, a Norman, Okla., native,
will have one last opportunity to
play in front of her friends and
family, and will likely bring a tew
more fans sporting Cardinal red
to the first round game.
"()f all the places to go, I think
our team should be very excited.
We played well there," Van-
Derveer said. "We'll have fans
there. It's not too far, in terms of a
flight, compared to the East Coast
and the time changes."
In addition to the familiarity of
venue, .it least one of the Ceorge
Washington players won't be a
stranger to the Cardinal. Sopho
more Lindsev Davidson not only
attended some of the Stanford
basketball camps, she was also a
high school teammate of Cardinal
freshman Chelsea Trotter.
Davidson, a strong 3-point
shooter and starter for the Colo
nials, is joined by a host of other
talented players.
leading George Washington is
sophomore Erica I .aw re nee, an
athletic small forward averaging
over 13 points a game.
In addition to Lawrence, the
Colonials boast five players that
stand 6-foot-M or above, including
Elena Vishniakova, Petra Dubov
cova and Ugo Oha, all of whom
have been important forces for
the Colonials all season. The
toughest factor in dealing with
the George Washington posts is
that many of the team's players
play a European style of basket
ball and thus are capable of hit
ting the outside shot as well as
posting up inside.
The Colonial that might give
the Cardinal the most problems,
however, is point guard Kristeena
Alexandra. Throughout the sea
son, Stanford has struggled to de
fend quick athletic point guards,
and Alexandra possesses all the
qualities of a player that can wreak
havoc on the Cardinal defense.
