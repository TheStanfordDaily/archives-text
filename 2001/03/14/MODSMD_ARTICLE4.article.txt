### MARK DOMINIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Faculty, students and stall
within the Division of Literatures,
( ultures and Languages stand tli
vided on the proposal to unite the
six departments into one.
Provost F.tchcmentb s atlvison
bo.ird meets in closed session toda\
to (list hsn the proposed mergei ol
the six departments. I he division
is currently comprised ol the l)e
-partmentsol Asian Languages ,md
Literatures, Compaiative Litera
ture, French and Italian, Centum
Studies. Slavit Languages and Lit
er.itures and Spanish and Por
tuguese. I'nder the proposal, the
division would retain its current
name, but cadi ol the si\ depart
ments would become .in area
under the departmental leader
ship ol the di\ ision.
II consolidated, the division
would oiler new majors, recruit
live more senior lacultx and free
depai tinent heads to teat li and re
seart h. However, some students
and lat ult\ (ontentl th.it diss< >1\ iug
the current departments would
cause a loss of departmental identi
t\ .md would lesiih in inferior
s< holarship.
Classroom innovation
"I'm ver\ exi ited about the pro
posal." Cerman Prof. Lli/abeth
Bernhardt s.iid. "I ntlei (lie pro
posal, more com ses w ill be ollei etl,
and more exciting com ses will
meet the needs ol Stanford unilci -
gratluates and graduates
"About 10 to 12 new courses a
vcai tan be olleretl because ol the
economies ol the single depart
ment." said |< >111i bender, assistant
dean ol I luni.unties and Sciences.

In the p.ist. division lat nlt\ lia\e
olleretl a number ol Introduction
to the I lumanities courses and
Stantbrd lniiodiK tor\ Seminars in
order to meet enrollment require
ments. according to Bender. In a
combined department, these pres
sures would be more general
at ioss .ill the fields, and more ad
vanced literature courses could be
olleretl because ol the reduced en
rollment ref|uirement pressures,
bender s.iid.
leaching tewci 1-1 luni courses
"will free up facultx to oiler more
courses toi graduate students,"
bender s.iid.
II consolidated into a single de
partment, ilic division would be
able to oiler .i single (ore course to
.ill graduate students in their first
veai. I Ins course would build col
legia! relationships among siu
t lei its <>l different national t list i
plincs. .ii cording to bender.
I he abilitN to tlo cross-discipli
n.ii \ work within one department
would .ilsi»open up new majors tor
untlei gi aduatcs.
"New .ue.is, such as l ilni and
Media Studies. I'ranslation. luio
pean Studies and I ransatlantic
Studies. (an be explored under the
new structure." bender said.
United strengths
I'nder the proposal, the divi
sion would have one Craduate
Studies .md Admissions Commit
tee .md one I udet graduate Stud
ies Committee, according to ben
der. One central thaii would also
administer the department.
I he si/c ol the department
would enable it to compete better
with other departments through
out the I niversitx Ibi binding and
attention.

"As ,i series <>t small depart
ments, we have not been compet
ing with large units for growth.
With a higgei. strongci depart
ment, it is easier to get resources."
Bender said.
" I he smaller .1 department is.
the more relativeh expensive it be
comes." Comparative Literature
Prof. Sepp(■uinbrec lit said. "II vou
have five prolessors. one adminis
trator and one chair, you have
enormous costs tor a relativelv
small department."
I lie consolidated department
would have an open structure, sim
ilar to that of the I listor\ or Fnglish
Departments. Facult\ searches
would be broad — without spci it\-
ing a single department of need.
"Limited searches are not the
wa\ to find the ver\ best facult\ in
an\ given year. We need broad
field searches to get the verv best
scholars," Bender said. " I here is
now a search 111 Kuropean Litera
ture; we might have searches in
large areas such as Film Studies.
Literatures and Languages of the
Americas. Asian Languages and so
forth."
Provost Ktchemendy guaran
tees (li.it the si/e of the faculu now
in the six departments will not
shrink under the new proposal.
Some f,u 11 It\ expressed then
skepticism toward thcil skepticism
in regards to the consideration.
"II someone leaves niv [Slavics]
program [now], I currently have
no guarantee we will be able to
maintain ii. I don't know whether a
new professor would be assigned to
Slavics or to Developmental Biolo
g\ or Svmbolic S\ stems." (irisha
Freidin, c hair of Slav it Languages
and 1 .itei aturcs. said.
"II this happens within the new.
larger department, then at least I
will be able to come to in\ col
leagues and look them straight in
the eve and sa\ 0111 program won't
survive without replacing this per
son." Freidin continued. " Ihe
amalgamated department that is
proposed will allow us to maintain
our combined faculty strength be
cause we will have great political
clout."
Intellectual reality
"Academic disciplines change.
I hese disc iplines were founded in
carl\ 19th century romanticism
and nationalism, and that is 110
longer the real intellectual frame,"
Cumhrccht said. "This new de
partment is much closer to what
the intellectual reality is than the
old department is. I his is like dif
ferent pin sic ists working 011 differ
ent natural phenomena.
Student and faculty work has
become more intcrdisc iplinan in
recent years, and many students
who start a a doc tot al study, iu one
modern literature department
complete it in another, according
to (.unibrec lit.

Ac cording to Bender, under a
single department, new opportu
nities for intcrdisciplinan work
will open up, and students will
move across national boundaries
more 112 reel v.
"We are doing a good job now. I
think we can do a better job on in
tcrdisciplinan studies," he said.
A history of underfunding
"In the department of French
and Italian, we have lost almost a
third of our faculty in the last 15
years," Jeffrey Schnapp. chair of
the French and Italian Depart
ment, said.
In an era of tight universit\ bud
gets, the language departments
have suffered cutbacks.
"A few years ago. one of our as
sistant professors decided that he
would rather be a Supreme Court
judge than a full professor of Russ
ian Literature. It was very likely he
would have gotten tenure. When
he left, the position disappeared,"
Freidin said.
With shrinking national enroll
ments in the humanities and new
research possibilities in the sci
ences, language professorships
have often been lost to professor
ships in cutting-edge fields.
"When you have a situation in
which a dean has to decide whether
he is going to assign the particular
position to a growing and impor

taut field, or allow a weak and un
stable department to i epl.u coneol
the positions that has become va
cant. the dean will sometimes de
cide in favor of the new and grow
ing field." Freidin said.
(ieneial I se IVrtnit limits on
personnel also force the I nivcrsit\
to (boose between disciplines, ac
cording to Freidin.
" I lie kev issues in this sector of
the I nivcrsit\ are resource issues.
I his is .i general problem within
the I nivcrsitv. as the st liool knows
all too well." Sclmapp said.
Loss of identity
I he facultv of the Department
of Spanish and Portuguese has
come out against the consolidation,
according to a doctoral student in
Spanish, Marisol Negron, and the
Department of French and Italian
has issued a memo outlining its ob
jections. I he Asian languages De
partment also opposes the merger,
according to Schnapp.
"Such [consolidated] depart
ments exist mostly at third- and
fourth-tier institutions without
graduate programs. Not a single
one of Stanford's peer institutions
has a structure of this kind." the
memo from the French and Italian
Department states.
Defenders of the current de
partment system argue that past at
tempts at a single language depart

ment have not been stu ( essful.
" I he solution that's being pro
posed is nothing new — it's a
throwb.u k to the wavs our depart
ments were organized at Stanford
through the 19(i05." Si linapp said.
"There was infighting among the
languages then, and, at that time,
the I nivcrsit\ did not have the
commitment then to run major
I'li.D. programs in all of the disci
plines that make up the division. 1
see no reason to believe it will be a
good solution fbt the future."
Lack of student involvement
"What I've heard is the word
barclv got out to the grad students
earlv on in the quarter. I still en
counter students who aren't aware
of this — including majors from
the various departments," senior
( arleen I'ino said. "The utider
grads have onlv had a couple of
days to get used to the idea. It
wasn't until I he Daih ranthestorv
on this earlv last week that I had
any indication of this."
Approximatelv II percent of
undergraduates were unaware of
the proposed merger according to
a Daih poll conducted yesterday.
Graduate students assert that
their input is not actively being
solicited.
"Bender, [Dean of the School of
Humanities ,ind Sciences Malcolm]
Bcaslcv and [Assoc. Dean of Hu

inanities and St lences Keith) Hakei
scheduled two meetings to talk to
gtad students where they an
swered questions about the pro
posal. At the second meeting, we
asked them: What tvpeof input can
we have? I hc\ told us that any sug
gestions that we had would have to
remain within the existing propos
al and that no alternatives would be
considered." Negron said.
After the meeting, "we onl\ had
a week to make suggestions." Ne
gron continued.
The graduate students voiced
objections at the Ac ademic ('.ouncil
meeting on Match Sand subse
quently met with I nivcrsitv Presi
dent John 112 lennessN on Monday.
" flic meeting with President
Hennessx was a step forward be
cause there was more student in
volvement. He did make time to
meet with us. which was very posi
tive. Pino said.
However, graduate students
want time to consider alternative
proposals.
"We want time to bring in out
side advisors to tell us what we
think of Humanities and Sciences's
plan. If we showed th.it this pro
posal would damage the future of
these departments, we would be al
lowed to give other proposals. We
aren't being given the time to do so.
We can't prepare alternative
frameworks," Negron said.

Students also complained that
the proposal comes up for ap
proval at the end of the quarter.
"We are students first, and we
won't be put into the position of
choosing between out work and
administrative work," Negron said.
Commitment to the humanities
"I sincerely feel that the deans
and the provost are committed to
retaining and ac tualh rejuvenating
the strengths of all of the present
departments," said Rob Robinson,
chair of (>erinan Studies.
"The proposed transformation
has no intellectual, politic al or aca
demic agenda; it is purely an ad
ministrative matter in order to
strengthen the humanities." Trei
din said.
"Such a solution is unworthy of
.i research institution of Stan
ford's caliber and ambitions and
has limited defensible intellectual
rationale." states the memo from
the Department of French and
Italian.
Ciumbrecht expressed a popu
lar opinion when he said, "This is
the third time we are trying some
thing like that in the I I years I've
been here. There are tons of meet
ings, it is very high cost. We just
need to get it over. Everybody's
talking about it. everyone's mind is
on the merger, and not on litera
ture and writing lx>oks."
