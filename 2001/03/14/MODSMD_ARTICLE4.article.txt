Provost F.tchcmentb s atlvison
bo.ird meets in closed session toda\
to (list hsn the proposed mergei ol
the six departments. I he division
is currently comprised ol the l)e
-partmentsol Asian Languages ,md
Literatures, Compaiative Litera
ture, French and Italian, Centum
Studies. Slavit Languages and Lit
er.itures and Spanish and Por
tuguese. I'nder the proposal, the
division would retain its current
name, but cadi ol the si\ depart
ments would become .in area
under the departmental leader
ship ol the di\ ision.
II consolidated, the division
would oiler new majors, recruit
live more senior lacultx and free
depai tinent heads to teat li and re
seart h. However, some students
and lat ult\ (ontentl th.it diss< >1\ iug
the current departments would
cause a loss of departmental identi

s< holarship.
Classroom innovation
"I'm ver\ exi ited about the pro
posal." Cerman Prof. Lli/abeth
Bernhardt s.iid. "I ntlei (lie pro
posal, more com ses w ill be ollei etl,
and more exciting com ses will
meet the needs ol Stanford unilci -
gratluates and graduates
"About 10 to 12 new courses a
vcai tan be olleretl because ol the
economies ol the single depart
ment." said |< >111i bender, assistant
dean ol I luni.unties and Sciences.

In the p.ist. division lat nlt\ lia\e
olleretl a number ol Introduction
to the I lumanities courses and
Stantbrd lniiodiK tor\ Seminars in
order to meet enrollment require
ments. according to Bender. In a
combined department, these pres
sures would be more general
at ioss .ill the fields, and more ad
vanced literature courses could be
olleretl because ol the reduced en
rollment ref|uirement pressures,
bender s.iid.
leaching tewci 1-1 luni courses
"will free up facultx to oiler more
courses toi graduate students,"
bender s.iid.
II consolidated into a single de
partment, ilic division would be
able to oiler .i single (ore course to
.ill graduate students in their first
veai. I Ins course would build col
legia! relationships among siu
t lei its <>l different national t list i
plincs. .ii cording to bender.
I he abilitN to tlo cross-discipli
n.ii \ work within one department
would .ilsi»open up new majors tor
untlei gi aduatcs.
"New .ue.is, such as l ilni and
Media Studies. I'ranslation. luio
pean Studies and I ransatlantic
Studies. (an be explored under the
new structure." bender said.
United strengths
I'nder the proposal, the divi
sion would have one Craduate
Studies .md Admissions Commit
tee .md one I udet graduate Stud
ies Committee, according to ben
der. One central thaii would also
administer the department.
I he si/c ol the department
would enable it to compete better
with other departments through
out the I niversitx Ibi binding and
attention.

"As ,i series <>t small depart
ments, we have not been compet
ing with large units for growth.
With a higgei. strongci depart
ment, it is easier to get resources."
Bender said.
" I he smaller .1 department is.
the more relativeh expensive it be
comes." Comparative Literature
Prof. Sepp(■uinbrec lit said. "II vou
have five prolessors. one adminis
trator and one chair, you have
enormous costs tor a relativelv
small department."
I lie consolidated department
would have an open structure, sim
ilar to that of the I listor\ or Fnglish
Departments. Facult\ searches
would be broad — without spci it\-
ing a single department of need.
"Limited searches are not the
wa\ to find the ver\ best facult\ in
an\ given year. We need broad
field searches to get the verv best
scholars," Bender said. " I here is
now a search 111 Kuropean Litera
ture; we might have searches in
large areas such as Film Studies.
Literatures and Languages of the
Americas. Asian Languages and so
forth."
Provost Ktchemendy guaran
tees (li.it the si/e of the faculu now
in the six departments will not
shrink under the new proposal.
Some f,u 11 It\ expressed then
skepticism toward thcil skepticism
in regards to the consideration.
"II someone leaves niv [Slavics]
program [now], I currently have
no guarantee we will be able to
maintain ii. I don't know whether a
new professor would be assigned to
Slavics or to Developmental Biolo
g\ or Svmbolic S\ stems." (irisha
