## 
### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
Only two months away from another trip to the
NCAA Championships in Athens, lla., the No. 2 Stan
ford men's tennis team (9-1, 2-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
has thus far met expectations with a solid season.
Besides its one blemish against No. 1 l'ChA(ll-0,
:>-0) in the finals of the National leant Indoors I 'ham
pionship, the Cardinal has dominated the rest of its
opponents.
Because the team returned five starters from last year,
the coaches expec ted that consistency would plav a large
part in the team's success. However, a pleasant surprise
has been the improvement in each individual's game
since the fall season.
"Out play so far has been very encouraging, with the
continued improvement of everyone on the team, our
doubles play and our team attitude and respect for each
other." said head coach Dick Could.
Hie play of the entire lineup has been reliable down
the line, as the individual records of each plaver are very
similar, with all starters already having achieved double
digit status in the win column. Kssentiallv, there has been
no need for any one plaver topic k up the slack for the en
tire team.
The lopsided match scores exhibit the depth of the
Cardinal lineup, ranging from the solid groundstrokes
of No. I singles player Alex Kim. a senior who is ranked
No. 2 in the country, to the serve-and-volley plav of
sophomore Scott Lipskv, the team's No. t> singles plaver.
I lie fact that there is very little margin of difference
among the starters contributes to the team's success.
Most teams in the nation have a star who can battle with
the best but lack solid No. 5 and (> plavers in the lineup.
In a team sport like collegiate tennis, solid depth is ke\
to pulling out close mate lies. Sometimes, it is the pla\ of
the bottom of the lineup that determines the winning
point in a tight 1-3 score.
Playing at the No. I to No. ti positions .ill \car have
been seniors S< oitv Scott and Ali Ansari and sophomores
Lipsky and Ryan Haviland.
Scott (12-4), considered to be the team's fiercest com
petitor, was bothered through a portion of tlie winter
season In an arm injury and the flu, but he will be ex
pected to contribute in the spring.
Ansari (10-5) has been one of the most consistent plav
ers on the team at No. 5 singles and has shown that he
c an be counted on every match to provide a dominating
win for the Cardinal.
Lipskv (10-4) has also done .i good job taking care of
business at the No. 0 spot, usually gi\ ing the ('.ardinal an
early advantage in its dual matches this year.
Haviland (12-3), who has attained a No. 00 national
ranking and is undefeated in dual matches, has been a
pleasant surprise for the team. He recently worked his
wav up as high as No. 1 in the singles lineup, thanks to an

excellent fall season and consistent play in the winter.
With strong plav from Kim, No. 13 K.J. Hippensteel,
a junior, and sophomore David Martin, ranked No. 19
nationally, the top of the lineup has become one of most
feared I -2-3 combinations in the country.
Knn (11-2), the defending NCAA, singles champion,
won the IIA Individual Indoors Championship last
month and also held a 17-match winning streak this year.
I le is currently battling injuries, but, according to Ckiuld,
Kim is still hitting tfie lull well.
I lippensteel (17-3), another contender for this year's
\( AA singles title, has been i ex k solid at No. 2 singles tor
the Cardinal, consistently holding the team together
with lus rocket-like left-handed serve.
Martin (10-0) has also more than held his own at No.
3 singles. Could said he has been pleased with the im
provement in his serve and his abilit\ to find a comfort
able st\ le of plav.
With a weak Brigham Noting team (3-4) coming in to
town m two weeks, the Cardinal will use the match to pre
pare fora rough stretch against ranked Pac-10 oppo
nents. including I CLA.
Junior Cert Vilms, a member of the Kstonia Davis
Cup team, will lead the Cougars into (lie match against
Stanford.
"It w ill be .i good match for us, especially since our last
dual match would be three weeks earlier, and since we
don't practice during final exams," Could said. "We ex
pect a good, but reasonable tuneup for the start of our
Pac-10 spring season."
Although the team has high expectations for the
N( '.AA ('.hampionships, C '.ould said he realizes that there
is room tor improvement.
" There Mill can be improvement in every phase of
each individual's game, such as in stroke production and
in the abilit\ to execute in different situations." he said.
"It is also ke\ to recognize when these different chal
lenges wit bin a mate h occur and to plav within one's abil
it\ to adjust to tliein."
M.im of the plavers said thc\ are alrcad\ itching to get
back into the swing of things.
"Kvervone knows the importance of the matches in
the spring, especially I'CLA, and I think the gins have
done a nice job improving throughout both quarters up
to this point," Scott said. "From BYI on, the season
moves quicklv, and the upcoming I'ac-10 matches
should be competitive .is alwa\ s."
"It was discouraging to lose to I CI.A (in the win
ter], but, at the same time, Max is when ii counts,"
I lippensteel s.iitl.
According to (iould, the team is in.i prime position to
perform well in the second half of the season.
"Currently, we are where we had hoped to be." lie
said. "We are ccrtainh in the middle of the ( base [for the

Senior Scotty Scott returns a shot for the No 2 men's tennis squcid in Inst week s sweep of William & Mary.
Only two months away from another trip to the
NCAA Championships in Athens, lla., the No. 2 Stan
ford men's tennis team (9-1, 2-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
has thus far met expectations with a solid season.
Besides its one blemish against No. 1 l'ChA(ll-0,
:>-0) in the finals of the National leant Indoors I 'ham
pionship, the Cardinal has dominated the rest of its
opponents.
Because the team returned five starters from last year,
the coaches expec ted that consistency would plav a large
part in the team's success. However, a pleasant surprise
has been the improvement in each individual's game
since the fall season.
"Out play so far has been very encouraging, with the
continued improvement of everyone on the team, our
doubles play and our team attitude and respect for each
other." said head coach Dick Could.
Hie play of the entire lineup has been reliable down
the line, as the individual records of each plaver are very
similar, with all starters already having achieved double
digit status in the win column. Kssentiallv, there has been
no need for any one plaver topic k up the slack for the en
tire team.
The lopsided match scores exhibit the depth of the
Cardinal lineup, ranging from the solid groundstrokes
of No. I singles player Alex Kim. a senior who is ranked
No. 2 in the country, to the serve-and-volley plav of
sophomore Scott Lipskv, the team's No. t> singles plaver.
I lie fact that there is very little margin of difference
among the starters contributes to the team's success.
Most teams in the nation have a star who can battle with
the best but lack solid No. 5 and (> plavers in the lineup.
In a team sport like collegiate tennis, solid depth is ke\
to pulling out close mate lies. Sometimes, it is the pla\ of
the bottom of the lineup that determines the winning
point in a tight 1-3 score.
Playing at the No. I to No. ti positions .ill \car have
been seniors S< oitv Scott and Ali Ansari and sophomores
Lipsky and Ryan Haviland.
Scott (12-4), considered to be the team's fiercest com
petitor, was bothered through a portion of tlie winter
season In an arm injury and the flu, but he will be ex
pected to contribute in the spring.
Ansari (10-5) has been one of the most consistent plav
ers on the team at No. 5 singles and has shown that he
c an be counted on every match to provide a dominating
win for the Cardinal.
Lipskv (10-4) has also done .i good job taking care of
business at the No. 0 spot, usually gi\ ing the ('.ardinal an
early advantage in its dual matches this year.
Haviland (12-3), who has attained a No. 00 national
ranking and is undefeated in dual matches, has been a
pleasant surprise for the team. He recently worked his
wav up as high as No. 1 in the singles lineup, thanks to an

excellent fall season and consistent play in the winter.
With strong plav from Kim, No. 13 K.J. Hippensteel,
a junior, and sophomore David Martin, ranked No. 19
nationally, the top of the lineup has become one of most
feared I -2-3 combinations in the country.
Knn (11-2), the defending NCAA, singles champion,
won the IIA Individual Indoors Championship last
month and also held a 17-match winning streak this year.
I le is currently battling injuries, but, according to Ckiuld,
Kim is still hitting tfie lull well.
I lippensteel (17-3), another contender for this year's
\( AA singles title, has been i ex k solid at No. 2 singles tor
the Cardinal, consistently holding the team together
with lus rocket-like left-handed serve.
Martin (10-0) has also more than held his own at No.
3 singles. Could said he has been pleased with the im
provement in his serve and his abilit\ to find a comfort
able st\ le of plav.
With a weak Brigham Noting team (3-4) coming in to
town m two weeks, the Cardinal will use the match to pre
pare fora rough stretch against ranked Pac-10 oppo
nents. including I CLA.
Junior Cert Vilms, a member of the Kstonia Davis
Cup team, will lead the Cougars into (lie match against
Stanford.
"It w ill be .i good match for us, especially since our last
dual match would be three weeks earlier, and since we
don't practice during final exams," Could said. "We ex
pect a good, but reasonable tuneup for the start of our
Pac-10 spring season."
Although the team has high expectations for the
N( '.AA ('.hampionships, C '.ould said he realizes that there
is room tor improvement.
" There Mill can be improvement in every phase of
each individual's game, such as in stroke production and
in the abilit\ to execute in different situations." he said.
"It is also ke\ to recognize when these different chal
lenges wit bin a mate h occur and to plav within one's abil
it\ to adjust to tliein."
M.im of the plavers said thc\ are alrcad\ itching to get
back into the swing of things.
"Kvervone knows the importance of the matches in
the spring, especially I'CLA, and I think the gins have
done a nice job improving throughout both quarters up
to this point," Scott said. "From BYI on, the season
moves quicklv, and the upcoming I'ac-10 matches
should be competitive .is alwa\ s."
"It was discouraging to lose to I CI.A (in the win
ter], but, at the same time, Max is when ii counts,"
I lippensteel s.iitl.
According to (iould, the team is in.i prime position to
perform well in the second half of the season.
"Currently, we are where we had hoped to be." lie
said. "We are ccrtainh in the middle of the ( base [for the
NCAA title] and capable of responding to .m\ and all
challenges. We are a talented team that is getting bettei.
.ind one that has the ability to l>e.it anyone."
