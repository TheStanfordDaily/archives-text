Saturday promised plenty of high
lights from the Cardinal squad, as the
Stanford men were slated to compete in
three events, the high jump, mile and
8,000-iiicter finals. In the high jump, ju
nior Michael Ponikvar, who leaped 7
feet, 2 1 -4 inches to qualify for the indoor
championship, couldn't match previous
heights, but leaped 0-1 1 3/4 to tie for sev
enth place.
In the mile final, the spotlight was on
Jennings, the defending indoor champi
on and 2000 Olympian. |cnnings came
into the final boasting the top prelimi
nary time, 3:59.75. In Saturday's final,
he ran his third sub-four minute mile of
the weekend, but was unable to fend ofl
eventual winner Hrvan lierryliill of Col
orado State.
lierrvhill distanced himself from the
field, claiming the title in 3:50.84.
Kansas State's Charlie Cruber barely
edged out |ennings for runner-up hon
ors. I hough lie i.iti the fastest 1,000-
meter time of the weekend in Friday
night's rcla\ split. Jennings was unable
to translate that speed into his second
mile title, finishing third in 3:58.84.
I lie ( .irdm.ll men ended competition
on a solid note, with strong perfor
mances m the 3,000-nieter from Rilev
and redshirt freshman Set li llejnv.
Riley, favored to win the title, burst to
the front of the pack, making a strong
move aftei the first 1,000 meters, with
onl\ defending champion David Kim.mi
of Alabama and Villanova's Adrian Hlin
coe threatening at his heels.
I lie trio held a lead over the rest of
the pack, with Rilev leading most of the
way. With 1,000 meters to go. Kiniani
made his move and Hlincoe followed.
I hc\ finished in th.il order, with Rilev
( basing for third place. Rilev finished in

8:06.04, short »>f his school record and
best time this season of 7:48.70, mostly
because of the race's lackadaisical open
ing pace.
For the women, sophomore
Fleshman had an impressive follow-up per
formance to last year's anchor leg on the
victorious women's distance mecllev relay.
This year, Fleshman's I ,000-meter
run put her in the individual spotlight,
as she watched her teammates compete
in the relay just a couple hours aftei run
ning 4:43.00 to finish second in her pre
liminary mile heat.
On Saturday, against a stellai field,
Meshman captured third place and Mi-
American honors, running 4: 13.52.
Tracy Robertson of Arkansas won the
race in 4:30.10. Fleshman's strong show
ing should set the tone for the outdooi
campaign, in which she excelled in the
5,000-meter last season.
Senior Elena Villarreal also competed
for the Cardinal women. In hei last col
legiate indoor meet, \ ill.u real went
0:30.05 over 3,000 nieiei s foi I 1111 place.

distance medley relax team. Coming off
last year's championship, the relax squad
finished near the ba< k of the pack, plat -
ing llili in a time of 11:40.10. Senioi
Ashlev (ouper, junior I)anielle Spurloc k
and sophomore Lindsax llx.iii joined
