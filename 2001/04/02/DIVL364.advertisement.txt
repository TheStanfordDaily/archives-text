Emm it "E.S Dimm feared he would
have to give up membership at Stanford
Federal Credit Union, so he never
completed a major!
After finally realizing that "once a
member, always a member" was a
truism at SFCU, E. S will he receiving
26 different undergraduate and
graduate degrees in June
When Fmmit Smithers Dimm
calculates the tuition he has paid in
56 years ;is a student he figures he has
spent well, probably enough to buy
a one bedroom fixer-upper near
college terrace. I he "" i year old li S.
Dimm was a little embarrassed to tell
his tale but wanted to help others
avoid the same pitfalls
"I've been a student as long as I
can remember," begins E.S. Dimm."l
was under the erroneous impression
that 1 needed to be an active student
to be a member of the Credit Union.
SFCU is such an incredible institu-
Ition —so current yet so friendly—
parting ways just seemed like it
would be too painful"
"Now I understand that no
matter where 1 go or what 1 do, I can
retain and cherish my membership
with SFCU. I've researched this pretty
carefully, now.The folks at SFCU said 1
wouldn't ever have to go—eVen if 1
wore blue and gold. Not that I would,
mind you."

Dear Q&Q: I was once told that the first U S. Mint was
protected by Nero. Is that some kind of spirit thing? Is Nero s
visage still seen today? Or was it just some guy with a Nero
mask
Signed. Scooby
Dear Scooby.
No need to start revving up the mystery machine. I've got this
one solved. The first United States Mint was built in
Philadelphia in 1792. The mint was guarded by a single dog
named Nero. Other beasts played important roles at the mint,
too. The entire place was powered by two oxen turning a
turbine The US has operated a mint in Philadelphia ever
since (with some modern improvements in processing and
security of course). I work at SFCU, so I know

Dear Q&Q: Momma always told me that "what goes around,
comes around '' and that "as you give, you will receive." I
always write my name on my dollars before I spend them to
see if its true, but so far I ve never had one come back to me.
Was Momma wrong ? Please say it isn t so.
Signed. Momma's Boy
Dear Boy.
Your Momma sounds like she didn't fall off the turnip truck this
morning However, try to think of her comments as proverbial
rather than concrete. (I'm sure she didn 't mean you would get
the very same dollar back!) And by the way, please stop writing
on the money. In 1792 defacement of US currency by Mint
employees was punishable by death. There s no "death for
ink " law now, but our forefathers look pretty stupid with
glasses and moustaches. I work at SFCU, so I know.
