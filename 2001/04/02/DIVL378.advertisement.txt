NEWTON'S
THREE LAWS OF
GRADUATION
Though famous lor his seminal work in
Mechanics, Isaac Newton's theories on the
prediction ot a doctoral graduation
formulated while Mill a grad student at
Cambridge remain his most important
contribution to academia.
PIRST LAW
"A cjrad student in procrastination
tends to stay in procrastination
unless an external force is applied
to it"
This postulate I s - known as the "Law of
Inertia' and was originally discovered expe
rimentally by Galileo tour years before
Newton was born when he threatened to
cut grad student's funding. I his resulted
in a quickening ot the student's research
pre >gress.
Galileos observations were later perfected
by Descartes through the application ol
"Weekly Meetings."
Before Galileo's time, it was wrongfully
thought that grad students would rest only
as long as no work was required of them
and that in the absence of external forces,
they would graduate by themselves.
