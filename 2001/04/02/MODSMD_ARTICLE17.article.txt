enough information to eliminate a time-con
suming and expensive run-off contest,
should the results be less than obvious.
I he new procedure addresses one of the
problems of past elections â€” namely, a sec
ond election that involved an unexpected
week n! campaigning for candidates and
more regulating for elections officials. Stu
dents and candidates deserve an efficient
and streamlined election, and this year's re
form could provide that.
Student elections provide one of the few
limes when students can express their voices
in ,i cohesive, high-profile and immediately
evident way. Inefficiently run elections can
frustrate and confuse students, which often
discourages them from voting in the next

election. One doesn't need to look very far to
see examples of inefficient elections affecting
civic participation on national and local levels.
One of the authors of the new voting bill,
doctoral candidate Dave Robinson, said that
this reform would address the problem of
lower voter turnout in runoff elections. With a
prolonged election process, fewer students are
interested in voting a second time and a small
er or less diverse group of students often even
tually elect the ASSU president and vice pres
ident. I laving one election could also prompt
students to place more trust in the system, as
they know they will be voting once, and with a
definitive outcome.
But this particular voting reform should
also be accompanied by measures for evalua-

tion every step of the way. We applaud the
ASSU's efforts to improve and streamline stu
dent elections, but evaluation and response to
voting reforms have been neglected in the past.
Last year, the ASSU debuted a demerit sys
tem for candidates who violated rules in the
campaign practices code, but few students
fully understood the reform or even knew
what the demerits meant. Few can forget the
chaos that ensued after that reform, and the
ASSU should try to avoid repeating that per
formance if at all possible.
The new reform is a step in the right direc
tion, but the ASSI should carefully monitor
the success of the voting changes during the
next two weeks for the sake of this and future
elections.
