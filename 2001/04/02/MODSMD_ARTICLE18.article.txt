# JUST A BIT OUTSIDE
## Speaker choice unclear 
### 
Shortly before spring break,
there was a lot ol commotion
within tlu' senioi < lass about the
announcement of (his year s
Commencement speaker. I niversitv
President John I lennessv's ollice selet I
ed Hewlett-Packard ( luef F\c< utive
Officer C'arlx Fiorina to speak .11 the
graduation. much to the shot k < >1.11 most
the entire scnioi < l.iss.
Someof in\ peet s wet e upset bet ause
thev thought we might have .1 forniei
president of the Tinted States speak .it
out graduation, which would be an
enormous honot Others thought we
would have .111 inspiring female scnatoi
from New York. I here was even t.ilk of
Nelson Mandela com-

ing.
But I am not as dis
appointed wlib (lie sc
let tion of Fioi ma as I
am with the wa\ n was
conununit atetl to the
publi(. I am upset be
cause it felt like some
one was dei eiving us.
I lure was a <lis-

crepancv in tlu* information miti.ilh
provided to flit* student 1 >«»< 1 \ .is to how
this selection process took plate. In
the University's press release. Dawn
1 .cvv wrote that " Fiorina was picked b\
Stanford's loin senioi ( lass presidents
in consultation with Piesident (olui
I lenncssv."
In an e-mail to the senior »lass from
Senior (ilass President Mike k.iss's ac
count, the < l.iss presidents wrote, "We
did not choose Ms. I'iorina. If you are
upset, if you want to vent, if von want to
look into anothci speakei. take it to the
soune, youi Iniveisity President. We
are simpb the hearers ol the news —
( all it had oi good, we have nothing to
do with it.
At first, the senior class presidents
tried to present the process of selecting
a speaker'as fait l\ democratic. Members
of the senior class made more than 50
nominations.
I he senioi class presidents came up
with a short list of eight to 10 possibili
ties and met with Henness\ and his as
sistant, thev said, on multiple <x ( asions.
Hennessv and his assistant then made
the selection.
Hut, after receiving roughly 00 e
mails in the first three days following
the announcement — tinee-quartcrs of
which expressed discontent — the ( lass
presidents wrote that message fiom
kass's computer, encouraging all com
plaints he directed to I lennessy's office.
Its understandable tli.it the (lass
presidents were getting frustrated.
Hennessv s office advised them not to

release the names that made the short
lisi of potential speakers, so members
of the senioi ( lass have no wav of know
ing it thcil voice was heard 01 consid
ered .it all. Also, for almost .1 week, it
was the senioi < lass presidents who
were blamed b\ anvone disappointed
with the sele( tion of I-iorina. I hat's just
not fair.
Aftei making the amiounceinent,
I lennessN again met with the (lass pres
idents .nid siibseijiicnth e-mailed the
entire senior (lass, stating that, indeed,
the ( hoi( e of speaker was his. "Make no
doubt, voui contribution to the process
is \er\ important," he wrote. "But in
evet \ \ear. itu hiding this one, the deri
sion ultimatch rests with the president."
I Ins should have been clear in the
beginning.
Fiorina nia\ be a wonderful speaker.
I have never heard hci speak and so 1
cannot and should not pass judgment. I
know she has spoken at .111 MI 1 gradu
ation. and I know she is an accom
plished alumna. 1 welcome her and look
foi ward to lieai ing w hat she has to say.
But I do find the I niversity's spin
tli.ii she is hei eto "address a generation
whose li\es have been changed and
challenged b\ technology as never be
fore" a bit weak. let hnological change
has been lampant for some time.
I o pinpoint our genet at ion's techno
logic al <11 hie\ements would be to ignore
the technology advancements in the
areas ol transportation and rommuni
( ation, whii h have been so prevalent in
prior generations.
Selecting Fiorina is fine. Perhaps the
student both's top 1 lioices were unavail
able to attend. We can't expect to get
anvone we want. We don't know the ex
tenuating circumstances in the sclet tion
process.
But we should.
I he selection process should be
made more transparent for all graduat
ing students. If we are asked for input,
we should know how much it is valued.
We should get an honest explanation
for why a speaker was chosen, rather
than two contradictory versions from
those we expect to make the decision.
We should be able to trust that our
input — that our voice and preferences
— is seriously considered, and we
should trust that the University will
make the best possible decision with
that m mint!.
But that trust can only come with
honesty.
Senior lirtan i.ule thinks Joel Stein must
have been unavailable to speak at Com
mencement. You ran reach Eule at
