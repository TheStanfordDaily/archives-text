### TIM KANE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When ilit' brackets tor the
N( CAA fountainem were tit si an
nounced, there was one team in
particular that t aught the eve of
cautious Stanford tans, a team
seemingly buried with a No.Ci
seed. A team with I he talent, the
si/.e and, most importantly, the
hunger — all of which would be
necessary t<>l an upset of the No. 1
seed ('.ardinal.
So it didn't come as a surprise
to main when the Maryland ler
rapins made their way into Ana
heim for the final of the West Re
gional playing their best basket
ball ot the year. Then again, it
didn't come as .1 surprise that
Stanford was there too, having
exorcised tlie second-round
demon against St. Joseph's and
coming fresh <>tl .1 comeback win
over (Cincinnati.
Both teams were as ready as
they could be.
Sometimes, though, basketball
isn't about who's ready and who's
not. Sometimes, it just comes
down to who has more talent.
And at the Arrowhead I'ond.with
a berth to the Final Four on the
line, the (Cardinal just couldn't
mate h the I crps' combination of
quickness, intensih and depth.
Behind inside muscle, tough
defense and a bat rage of'3-point
ers, Maryland ended Stanford's
season with a decisive 87-73 win
that left little doubt about who
was the best team in the West (le
gion. that is).
"Thc\ played great, and the\
shot the ball extremely well," said
Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery. "I ven time we seemed
to make a plav, they had an an
swer for it."
Just as Stanford (31-3) had
done to so many opponents this
season, Maryland (25-10) relied
on .1 potent inside-outside combo

for the win, shooting a ridiculous
(>9.2 percent from 3-point range
while out-rebounding the (Cardi
nal, n.vjs.
I he stat sheet, though, didn't
tell the entire story. What truly
did Stanford in was a 14-2 Mary
land run in the second half, only
moments after the Cardinal had
scored seven straight pointstorut
the Terps' lead to three. A 3-

Senior point guard Michael McDonald frowns after the Cardinal's 87-73
loss to Maryland in the Elite Eight of the NCAA men's basketball tournament
points. "At 110 point in this game did
we have control. We were playing
catch-up, and it was just too tar
against .1 team that was too good."
I he Cardinal never could find
an answer tor Baxter, a bruising
forward who used his quick feet to
maneuver around the Collins twins
inside on his wav to scoring 21
points, a performance that helped
gain him the West Region's Most

would have given his right arm for
either Curtis Borchardt or «i
healthy Justin Davis (who plaved
otilv four minutes), who might
have slowed Baxter down.
And it it wasn't Baxter on the in
side. it was Dixon, Tab) Holden or
Steve Blakeon the outside. As Stan
ford worried about controlling
Baxter, the ball would find its wa\
to open shooters on the outside
who knockcd down an incredible

9-ot-l'i shots from behind the art.
1 he problems weren't con
lined to the defense. On the of
fensive end, the long arms and
quick feet ol Baxter, Holden and
Terence Morris, among others,
wreaked havoc on the Cardinal's
offensive rlivthm, leading to eight
steals while killing crucial Stan
ford rallies.
Passing lanes that were iisualh
clear were clogged np. Shots that
had alwavs been open were chal
lenged. 1 he offensive rhvthm that
had been there all ve.n lot senior
point guard Michael McDonald

and Stanford siiddenh vanished,
replac ed bv a team that had trouble
scoring 2-poitit baskets for long
stretches in both halves.
For the game, the Cardinal shot
only II percent from the field, the
lowest mark all year, and the
Collins twins combined to score
onlv 21 points while grabbing a
mere seven rebounds between the
two of them. Ryan Mendcv led the
team with IS points, 12 of which
were from behind the 3-point arc.

When ilit' brackets tor the
N( CAA fountainem were tit si an
nounced, there was one team in
particular that t aught the eve of
cautious Stanford tans, a team
seemingly buried with a No.Ci
seed. A team with I he talent, the
si/.e and, most importantly, the
hunger — all of which would be
necessary t<>l an upset of the No. 1
seed ('.ardinal.
So it didn't come as a surprise
to main when the Maryland ler
rapins made their way into Ana
heim for the final of the West Re
gional playing their best basket
ball ot the year. Then again, it
didn't come as .1 surprise that
Stanford was there too, having
exorcised tlie second-round
demon against St. Joseph's and
coming fresh <>tl .1 comeback win
over (Cincinnati.
Both teams were as ready as
they could be.
Sometimes, though, basketball
isn't about who's ready and who's
not. Sometimes, it just comes
down to who has more talent.
And at the Arrowhead I'ond.with
a berth to the Final Four on the
line, the (Cardinal just couldn't
mate h the I crps' combination of
quickness, intensih and depth.
Behind inside muscle, tough
defense and a bat rage of'3-point
ers, Maryland ended Stanford's
season with a decisive 87-73 win
that left little doubt about who
was the best team in the West (le
gion. that is).
"Thc\ played great, and the\
shot the ball extremely well," said
Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery. "I ven time we seemed
to make a plav, they had an an
swer for it."
Just as Stanford (31-3) had
done to so many opponents this
season, Maryland (25-10) relied
on .1 potent inside-outside combo

for the win, shooting a ridiculous
(>9.2 percent from 3-point range
while out-rebounding the (Cardi
nal, n.vjs.
I he stat sheet, though, didn't
tell the entire story. What truly
did Stanford in was a 14-2 Mary
land run in the second half, only
moments after the Cardinal had
scored seven straight pointstorut
the Terps' lead to three. A 3-

Senior point guard Michael McDonald frowns after the Cardinal's 87-73
loss to Maryland in the Elite Eight of the NCAA men's basketball tournament
points. "At 110 point in this game did
we have control. We were playing
catch-up, and it was just too tar
against .1 team that was too good."
I he Cardinal never could find
an answer tor Baxter, a bruising
forward who used his quick feet to
maneuver around the Collins twins
inside on his wav to scoring 21
points, a performance that helped
gain him the West Region's Most

Outstanding I'layer award. Mont
gomerv s lone option 011 the bench
was t)-toot-<) freshman levo John
son; vou can bet Montgomery
would have given his right arm for
either Curtis Borchardt or «i
healthy Justin Davis (who plaved
otilv four minutes), who might
have slowed Baxter down.
And it it wasn't Baxter on the in
side. it was Dixon, Tab) Holden or
Steve Blakeon the outside. As Stan
ford worried about controlling
Baxter, the ball would find its wa\
to open shooters on the outside
who knockcd down an incredible

9-ot-l'i shots from behind the art.
1 he problems weren't con
lined to the defense. On the of
fensive end, the long arms and
quick feet ol Baxter, Holden and
Terence Morris, among others,
wreaked havoc on the Cardinal's
offensive rlivthm, leading to eight
steals while killing crucial Stan
ford rallies.
Passing lanes that were iisualh
clear were clogged np. Shots that
had alwavs been open were chal
lenged. 1 he offensive rhvthm that
had been there all ve.n lot senior
point guard Michael McDonald

and Stanford siiddenh vanished,
replac ed bv a team that had trouble
scoring 2-poitit baskets for long
stretches in both halves.
For the game, the Cardinal shot
only II percent from the field, the
lowest mark all year, and the
Collins twins combined to score
onlv 21 points while grabbing a
mere seven rebounds between the
two of them. Ryan Mendcv led the
team with IS points, 12 of which
were from behind the 3-point arc.
