When ilit' brackets tor the
N( CAA fountainem were tit si an
nounced, there was one team in
particular that t aught the eve of
cautious Stanford tans, a team
seemingly buried with a No.Ci
seed. A team with I he talent, the
si/.e and, most importantly, the
hunger — all of which would be
necessary t<>l an upset of the No. 1
seed ('.ardinal.
So it didn't come as a surprise
to main when the Maryland ler
rapins made their way into Ana
heim for the final of the West Re
gional playing their best basket
ball ot the year. Then again, it
didn't come as .1 surprise that
Stanford was there too, having
exorcised tlie second-round
demon against St. Joseph's and
coming fresh <>tl .1 comeback win
over (Cincinnati.
Both teams were as ready as
they could be.
Sometimes, though, basketball
isn't about who's ready and who's
not. Sometimes, it just comes
down to who has more talent.
And at the Arrowhead I'ond.with
a berth to the Final Four on the
line, the (Cardinal just couldn't
mate h the I crps' combination of
quickness, intensih and depth.
Behind inside muscle, tough
defense and a bat rage of'3-point
ers, Maryland ended Stanford's
season with a decisive 87-73 win
that left little doubt about who
was the best team in the West (le
gion. that is).
"Thc\ played great, and the\
shot the ball extremely well," said
Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery. "I ven time we seemed
to make a plav, they had an an
swer for it."
Just as Stanford (31-3) had
done to so many opponents this
season, Maryland (25-10) relied
on .1 potent inside-outside combo

for the win, shooting a ridiculous
(>9.2 percent from 3-point range
while out-rebounding the (Cardi
nal, n.vjs.
I he stat sheet, though, didn't
tell the entire story. What truly
did Stanford in was a 14-2 Mary
land run in the second half, only
moments after the Cardinal had
scored seven straight pointstorut
the Terps' lead to three. A 3-

jumped out to a 1 lead, a lead
that would never shrink below
nine.
"We got ourselves in too big of
a hole, and that's the bottom line."
