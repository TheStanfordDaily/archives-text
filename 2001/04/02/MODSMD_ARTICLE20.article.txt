Students question selection
of graduation speaker
Editor's Note: This letter was origttuilly circu
lated as an open letter to President Hennessx
and the senior class presidents.
We've spoken with many of our senior
friends; many do not feel that they can re
late to C '.arly Fiorina's experiences and do
not think that they are as broad as past
speakers' experiences.
We have a few questions to ask and re
quests to make. For one, we think those of
us who nominated individuals on the
Web site the senior class presidents set up
for the purpose of finding a Commence
ment speaker deserve to know who the
100-plus nominees were, and who were
the 10 finalists submitted on a list to Uni
versity President John Hcnnessy. Accord
ing to a Stanford Report article, last year
Kofi Annan was the "top recommenda
tion'' by last year's c lass presidents, which
implies that they ranked their choices.
Secondly, we think the senior class
presidents are our representatives. We
elected them. Therefore, when we re
ceived the message via e-mail that they are
simply the messengers of Hennessy in an
nouncing the selection of the Commence
ment speaker, and that we should redi
rect any complaints about that selection
directly to Hennessy, we felt bereft of rep
resentation and a focused voice.
If the class presidents have been all
along channeling our suggestions to Hen
nessy, and working with him, isn't it more

expedient for them to tarry our opinions
to him on this issue?
lo Hennessy, we appreciate that you
must be flooded with communications.
We think it is Mike Kass, Robert
son. Delphine Tuot and Brandon
Maughan's duty to follow through on all
the aspects of the selection of a Com
mencement speaker that they can. That
said, kass's e-mail [to the senior class]
seemed to indicate that the four of them
are done working on this.
Finally, we appreciate all of the work
the c lass presidents and Hennessy have
put into selecting a Commencement
speaker, and we are impressed with Fio
rina's achievements. But we would like to
point out the conscious or unconscious
message the selection of Fiorina sends
out. Because of her leadership position
at Hewlett Packard, a company with
unique affiliations to this University and
to the revolutionary industry begun in
Silicon Valley, the selection of Fiorina to
speak at our Commencement ties that
company and industry more tightly to
our University community. Whether
you look at this as good or bad, it is not
neutral.
Even those of us who can better relate
to the experiences of Fiorina wish we all
had a more public figure speaking at our
Commencement. While someone like
Kofi Annan, tot instance, may be more
geared to those interested in internation
al affairs and human rights, he is accus
tomed and invited to speak tor widely di
verse audiences. 1 he same could be said

for past speakers like the American Poet
Laureate Robert Pinsky. While Fiorina
may be as influential .is these other fig
ures, we do not know her as a figure who
speaks out to address public issues.
Especially at Commencement, at
which all graduating students come to
gether, the choice of a speaker with the
specific experience of Fiorina is glaringly
un-inclusivc iu its appeal.

Board of Supervisors should
be congratulated
1 he Santa (llara ( ountx Hoard of Su
pervisors has acted to curtail the unnec es
sarv, some sa\ illegal, placement ol tlie
Carnegie Institute in the- Stanford
Foothills. I would like to thank the Com
mitte tot Creen Foothills. the Stanford
Open Space Alliance, Li/ kniss and (In
board for giving meaningful voice (<> the
idea that open space is important. ()n lu -
half of future generations of people and
other species who now might draw suste

grateful. I am confident Stanford will find
a mot e appropriate spot to pave over for

Latin American Studies Center a vital
part of academic community
As an alumni of the Center for Uitin
American Studies's undergraduate and
master's programs, 1 was extremely sur
prised and saddened to learn of the cen
ter's potential closure. In the total of m\
five years spent at Stanford I niversitv,
tfie center was inv academic home — the
place from which I chew inspiration,
knowledge, technical support .uul cama
raderie. Its closure would be a great loss
tot the campus, patticulaih now as rela
tions between the I nited States and
Latin America become increasingly com
plex .ind t.ikc- center stage- in I S. foreign
policy debates.
As an undergraduate, 1 majored in
histoi \ and ininored in Latin American
Studies. As each new quarter neared, 1
anxioush awaited the- printout from
I .at in American Studies listing .ill tlu- up
coming courses on Latin America and
was consistenth overwhelmed b\ the
breadth and quality of courses and
learning opportunities. 1 explored an
cient cultures through anthropology,
studied Spanish language and Mexican
history with visiting professors and en
rolled in a course on I S.-Latin Ameri
can trade as the NAFI A debates raged
in Washington.
During m\ junior war, I spent three
months in Santiago, Chile, and began to
learn about thegre.it divcrsit\ within the
region often viewed heterogeneoush as
"Latin America." In short, I was im
mersed in evervthing 1 .atin American and
surrounded b\ people with .i simil.u love

tor tlie region and learning interests.
During my junior year, the renter's
current Associate Director, Kathleen
Morrison, guided me to apply tor fund
ing to conduct primary research in Mexi
co tor my honor's thesis. I was awarded
two fellowships and spent several months
living in an orphanage in Mexico and re
searching the root causes of child aban
donment. That summer was the corner
stone ot my undergraduate career and
culminated not onlv in a thoroughly ful
filling thesis, hut also in what has become
a lasting interest 111 the impact of migra
tion on children and families.
When I left Stanford, I was one among
a small minority of m\ friends who had
cultivated (lose tics with faculty and found
a real sense of academic In-longing. I re
mained in touch with in\ facult\ mentors
and I lic'\ continued to ottei guidance as
well as strong and personal letters of rec -
ommendation for me 111 niv pursuits din -
ing the vears that followed.
Aftei several vears of working with im
migrant communities throughout ('.ali
fornia. 1 returned toStanfoi d tor m\ mas
ter's iu l.atin American Studies in
Surrounded In a diverse and extremely
talented group of students (with interests
ranging from intei national tinance to in
digenous ac tivism in Mexico), I was con
sistent overwhelmed In the qualitx of
visiting professoi s from throughout I .atin
America who served as the c enter of ilie
master's program.
I lirough ni\ woi k as .t teaching assis
tant. I was ottered real opportunities to
lu lp shape courses and guide undergrad
uate learning — skills that helped me ob

tain employment in the Clobal Studies
Department of California State I Diversi
ty Montere\ Ba\ after my graduation.
Work 011 child migration soon launched
into a thesis guided In Director ot latin
American Studies ferry Karl, which sent
me diving into priman documents to put
together the story of I'.S. policy toward
unaccompanied Latin American Illinois.
Mv vear back at the ('.enter helped ground
me in niv careei put suits and immerse me
once again in the quest fora multi-faceted
understanding of t he region.
I am certain that m\ overwhelmingly
positive experiences with the ('enter for
Latin American Studies is in no wa\
unique to those of us that know the pro
gram. l lie center otters main unique
things at Stanford, including a well-inte
grated interdisciplinary learning course
and faculty who take time to get to know
their students and ottei much-needed
mcntorship through the ma/e of funding
applications, graduate career decisions
and life choices.
I he center was the highlight of my
Stanford career, what enabled me to con
tinue to stay attached to the University
after my graduation and what attracted
me back tor a second degree, lot lose this
hub ot interc ultural dialogue and debate
just as the I nited Slates reaches a cross
roads in its relationships with Mexico,
Colombia, Cuba and the region as a
whole, is short-sighted and against the in
terests of the Stanford community.
