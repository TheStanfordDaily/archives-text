Students question selection
of graduation speaker
Editor's Note: This letter was origttuilly circu
lated as an open letter to President Hennessx
and the senior class presidents.
We've spoken with many of our senior
friends; many do not feel that they can re
late to C '.arly Fiorina's experiences and do
not think that they are as broad as past
speakers' experiences.
We have a few questions to ask and re
quests to make. For one, we think those of
us who nominated individuals on the
Web site the senior class presidents set up
for the purpose of finding a Commence
ment speaker deserve to know who the
100-plus nominees were, and who were
the 10 finalists submitted on a list to Uni
versity President John Hcnnessy. Accord
ing to a Stanford Report article, last year
Kofi Annan was the "top recommenda
tion'' by last year's c lass presidents, which
implies that they ranked their choices.
Secondly, we think the senior class
presidents are our representatives. We
elected them. Therefore, when we re
ceived the message via e-mail that they are
simply the messengers of Hennessy in an
nouncing the selection of the Commence
ment speaker, and that we should redi
rect any complaints about that selection
directly to Hennessy, we felt bereft of rep
resentation and a focused voice.
If the class presidents have been all
along channeling our suggestions to Hen
nessy, and working with him, isn't it more

expedient for them to tarry our opinions
to him on this issue?
lo Hennessy, we appreciate that you
must be flooded with communications.
We think it is Mike Kass, Robert
son. Delphine Tuot and Brandon
Maughan's duty to follow through on all
the aspects of the selection of a Com
mencement speaker that they can. That
said, kass's e-mail [to the senior class]
seemed to indicate that the four of them
are done working on this.
Finally, we appreciate all of the work
the c lass presidents and Hennessy have
put into selecting a Commencement
speaker, and we are impressed with Fio
rina's achievements. But we would like to
point out the conscious or unconscious
message the selection of Fiorina sends
out. Because of her leadership position
at Hewlett Packard, a company with
unique affiliations to this University and
to the revolutionary industry begun in
Silicon Valley, the selection of Fiorina to
speak at our Commencement ties that
company and industry more tightly to
our University community. Whether
you look at this as good or bad, it is not
neutral.
Even those of us who can better relate
to the experiences of Fiorina wish we all
had a more public figure speaking at our
Commencement. While someone like
Kofi Annan, tot instance, may be more
geared to those interested in internation
al affairs and human rights, he is accus
tomed and invited to speak tor widely di
verse audiences. 1 he same could be said

for past speakers like the American Poet
Laureate Robert Pinsky. While Fiorina
may be as influential .is these other fig
ures, we do not know her as a figure who
speaks out to address public issues.
Especially at Commencement, at
which all graduating students come to
gether, the choice of a speaker with the
specific experience of Fiorina is glaringly
un-inclusivc iu its appeal.
