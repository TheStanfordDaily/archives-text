### SAMEER AHMED EDITORIAL STAFF 
All season long, the No. 2 Stanforc men's basketball team
and the rest of the Pacific 10 (.onterewe talked about how they
never received anv respect.
Because of the media's Kast Coast bias, the Pac-10's televi
sion deal with the Fox Sports Nctwoik and the three-hour
time /one differential between cojsis. Pac-10 plavers and
coaches complained th.it the \meri an people knew very lit
tle about West ('.oast basketball.
Sadlv, the ('.ardinal's lii si natic>n;ll\ televised game tins sea
son. last Saturday's 87-73 loss to Mpvland in the l.lite Light of
the NCAA t ournament, was alsotts last of the season. Fven
more unfair for the Stanford plavrrs, the defeat b\ Maryland
will be the one Stanford game tli<i Amci u ans u ill remember
the most.
But anv die-hard member ofthe Sixth Man (Hub knows

that Saturday's loss was an aberration in an otherwise almost
perfect season for the Cardinal, a team that head coach Mike
Montgomery called one of his best ever.
"We're as proud of these kids as we can be in all the things
we've accomplished [this season]," Montgomen said.
Montgomery has a lot to proud about.
Stanford's 111 wins this season are the most in school histo
ry, and no matter who w ins the NCAA Championship todav,
the Pac-10 champion Cardinal will finish this season as the
only team in the nation with less than four losses.
I bis is the same team that started the season 20-0 and had
many people thinking Stanford would finish the season unde
feated. I he Cardinal also didn't lose a regular season game
awa\ from Maples Pavilion this season.
While Stanford performed exceptionally all season, per
haps the peak of its success (ante over winter break when the
(Cardinal defeated both Duke and Arizona, the two teams com

()n Dec. 21 in front of the largest crowd to watch a collegiate
basketball game in the state of California, sophomore swing
man (lase\ Jacobsen banked in a jumper with 3.6 seconds left
in the game as the then-No. 3 Cardinal roared bat k from an
1 I -point deficit in the final four minutes to beat the top-ranked
Blue Devils, 84-83, at the Pete Newell Challenge.
I wo weeks later, Stanford beat preseason No. I Arizona
with relative ease, 85-76, in luc son tor the first time since
1996.
I his year's team was led bv one of the strongest senioi (lass
es in school history, point guard Michael Mc Donald and for
wards Ryan Mendez and Jarron Collins.
"I've learned a lot this season from the seniors," Jacobsen
said. "Those guvs know w hat's up. M\ goal is to leave Stanford
basketball with the pride and dignitv that thev have left us
with. It's been a pleasure, and we w ill miss tliein."
I he seniors will leave the Farm with more than just pride
and clignitv.
Leading the Pac-10 in 3-point shooting percentage (51.4
percent) and assist-to-turnover ratio (3-to-l), Mc Donald had
his best season by far and was considered bv many to be the ke\
to Stanford's success this year.
Co-captain Mendez was the team's venal leadei and a valu
able scorer who rarelv missed a free throw, especialh when the
game was on the line. Mende/'s 93.1 tree-tlnow percentage
led the nation, and he set a Pac-10 record bv hitting 49 con
secutive free throws.
jarron Collins, a sure bet toi the NBA. complemented hn
twin brother Jason to give the Cardinal one of its best front
lines ever. |arron,a Wooden All-American and First I earn All
Pac-10 selection, finished the season averaging a respectable
12.8 points and (>.7 rebounds a game.
Unless both Collins twins get drafted In the same NBA
team, the Maryland loss was probably the last time |arron and
|ason will play competitive basketball together. When the
Southern California duo chose Stanford over I (.1A and Ari

Stanford recruits ever.
