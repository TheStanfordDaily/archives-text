MINNEAPOLIS (AP) â€” The
Arizona Wildcats are on the brink
of college basketball's national
championship altera season of sor
row.
Hie coach's wile diet! and the
basketball eittice secretary was diag
nosed with a brain tumor. There
were problems on the court, too:
the star center was suspended tor
six games and a team ranked No. 1
in the country as the season began
started an awful <S-">.
1 his year I've learned more
about lite than 1 have about basket
ball,'" reserve tbrward |ustin YVessel
said.
Arizona plays Duke tor the title
tonight. I he Blue Devils have had
their own troubles, albeit none in
volving lite or death. Duke was
picked two vcars ago to win the na
tional championship but tailed,
and this year's underclassmen
hope to do what the 1909 team
could not.
I here was little to suggest at the
start ot the season how much Ari
zona would have to overcome. It
was ranked No. I in the preseason,
and all live starters were nominated
tbrthe |ohn Wooden pl.ivet of the
\ear award, the first time that's
happened in the award's 24-vear
history.
('.enter loren Woods went solar
as to call the Wildcats potentialK
the best college team ever.
The preseason cockiness is gone
now, replaced In a cool contii lence
born of adversity.
The NCAA suspended Woods
tor the first six games ot the season
tor accepting improper benefits
from a laniih friend. Richard |ef
ferson was suspended for one
game tor act epting a plane tic ket to
San Diego and a ticket toC ianic 7 ot
the NBA Finals from Bill Walton,
whose son l.nke is Jefferson's best
friend.
Then the team learned about
sorrow.
In December, basketball secre

tary Monica Armenta suffered a
seizure from a brain tumor. And on
Jan. 1, Bobbi Olson, wile of coach
Tutc ()lson. died ot ovarian cancer.
Outgoing and good-natured,
Mrs. Olson offset her husband's
sometimes stern demeanor. She
would wink at players alter her hus
band had berated them, and thev
were welcomed into her home.
' When Mrs. () passed awav, we
lost a part of our family because she
was the mother to us," Jefferson
s.ii(T
Arizona's Mi Kale ( '.enter court
was renamed Lute & Bobbi ()lson
Conn. Her memori.il service was
televised live throughout Tucson.
Jefferson and Wesscl were among
the speakers.
"Everything now seems easy
compared to that." Jefferson said.
"Playing in a national champi
onship lias special meaning, but it
doesn't have the same importance
as speaking at Mrs. ()'s funeral."
On Dec. .SO. the ustialh stoic
coach Olson wept as lie told bis
plavers he would take a lea\e of ab
sence to be with his wife. That
night, Mississippi State beat Ari
zona, the first time the Wilde ats had
lost in their own Fiesta Bowl I loli
ela\ Classic.
I luce days after her death, .Ari
ze >n.i beat ( alilornia, but a frustrat
ed Woods was ejec ted and had to
be held back from attacking a ref
eree. Two clavs later, Arizona lost
at home to Stanford to tall to 8-5.
The Wildcats won their next
game to start a run that hasreae bed
20-2. The following week, Olson
made an emotional return.
Now they've reached Min
neapolis, where coach ()lsoti went
to college and the couple started
their family. Olson's five children
and I I gi andc hildreti have helped
him through his grief.
" They've known that thev need
