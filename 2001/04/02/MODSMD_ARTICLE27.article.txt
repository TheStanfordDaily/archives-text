week. And. like a lot ot other
spring breakers, the members ot
(Ik- Cardinal squad did some
thing tli.it the\ probablv regret

during the otherwise enjoyable
break.
The No. 1 Cardinal (11-5, 7-4
Mountain Pacific: Sports Federa
tion) turned in a regrettable per
formance against No. 5 long
Beach State (14-(>. 9-5) last Thurs
day In dropping a disappointing
:t-l decision to the 49ers at the
Pyramid in Long Beach.
\nd while other spring break
ers with regrets immediately

headed over to Cowell on their
return to the Farm, the Stanford
squad headed straight tor the
gym to prepare tot a big week ot
conference matches.
The Cardinal starts a six
match homestand to close out the
regular season with matches
tonight and tomorrow against
No. 1 Brighain Young (10-3, 10-
3). Both matches begin at 7 p.m.
in Maples Pax ilion.
"We did not play out best vol
leyball at Long Beach, and thev
took advantage ol it. said sopho
more outside bitter Bill\ Strick
land. "We missed a good oppor
tunity to prove ourselves. We
need to pick up our defense,
blocking and digging in order to
be successful against BYI '."
Stanford faced Long Beach
without the ('.animal's leading at
tacker. sophomore outside hitter
Cant 1 oppel, who missed his
third consecutive match with a
groin strain. Toppel's absence
was noticeable as Long Beach
out hit. outblockcd and outdug
Stanford in the match.
Long Beach held Stanford to a
.088 hitting percentage in the
opening game and easih cruised
to a 30-22 victon . The Cardinal
put up a better tight in the second
game with a more consistent at
tack. but two late hitting errors let
the 49ers pick up a 30-20 win.
Strickland and sophomore
middle blocker Paul Bocage led
an offensive ralK In the ( ardinal
m tin' third game as tlie two com
bined tor 1 1 kills. Stanford pit ked
up 20 kills while hitting at a . l">7
clip in taking game three, 30-24.
"We tried to wake up in that
third game," said redshirt sopho
more libero Seth King, who had
six digs tor Stanford. " I hat's our
tvpical game, and that's the Stan
ford caliber of vollevball that we
should and can pl.iv everv game.
We came out Hat and plaved with
cement shoes the rest of the wav."
1 he third game loss didn't

phase Long Beach, and the Car
dinal tell apart under a fourth
game surge In the 49ers. Long
Beach took the first eight points
of the game, and the 49ers
( rushed Stanford, 30-20, to (lose
out the match.
|unioi outside hitter Marcus
Skat el posted a mateh-high 22
kills toi Stanford. but Long Beach
had lour plavers with double
digit kills, led l>\ senior David
\1( Ken/ie, w ho posted bis second
consecutive double-double with
10 kills and I."> digs.
"The wav we competed
against Long Beach was disap
pointing," said head coach Ruben
Nieves. "It felt like we didn't have
the tenacitx and the passion that
we want to have c barac teri/e our
play. Because ot that we got out
plaved at everv position and
couldn't compete the wav we
wanted to."
I lie loss puts Stanford a half
game back of the 49ers for fourth
place in the overall conference
standings. With the top tour
teams in the conference getting to
host first round matches in the
conference tournament, tonight
and tomorrow's matches against
BYI bold a lot of significance in
terms of the Cardinal's postsea
son plans.
"We really want to play at
home in the plavotfs as much as
we can," Nieves said. "But what's
most important is establishing the
level ot pla\ we're going to have
m ibis final stretch of the season.
We're plaving a lot ot plavoff c al
iber teams, and we need to re-es
tablish our standard of execution
and unitv."
BYU comes to the Farm with a
No. 1 ranking that it has held
since Feb. 27 and with the na
tion's best record, which boasts
onlv three losses on the season.
I lowever, that third loss came just
two cla\s ago at the hands of No.
12 Pacific, which outlasted the
('.ougars to steal a 3-2 upset.
