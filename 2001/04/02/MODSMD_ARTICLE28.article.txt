So now add the names \lc( iraxx. Rilex and Ivev to

I It 11 seasi >ii as ( oaeli and in liei second trip to the

Final l our. She also got Notre Dame there in 1997.
In the first one, the Irish were just happy to be
there. I hev came determined to win this time after
being ranked No. I tor tive weeks this season — and
they got it done.
"I always dreamed of this moment, and then to
have it happen in my hometown." Ivey said. "I'm to
tally blessed."
Hanev finished with 13 points for Notre Dame,
l\e\ scored 12 and Siemon had 10.
I lie Irish, the best three-point shooting team in
the nation, won despite going 1-tor-10 from behind
the arc. Alicia Katav, the nation's best individual per
former, was 1 -for-4.
Douglas came through with IS for Purdue and
had the Boilermakers' final points, converting a
three-point |>lav off a steal and lavup to give Purdue

bright futures with the Boilermakers, each scoied 17.
Douglas also had seven rebounds, five steals and five
assists .is her brilliant < areer came to an end. She was
.i st.ii ter on the '99 championship team.

minutes.
"I knew it would be a battle,"' Douglas said. "Ruth
plaved a great game."
Notre I )ame trailed 19-7 early and was down six .it
li.illnnic. But the lush have this comeback thing
down p.it. I hev rallied from lit points down in Fridav
night's semifinal to beat Connecticut — the biggest
comeback in the 20 vears of the women's Final loin.
And tliex did it again.
Kilr\ had foui points as Notre Dame started the
