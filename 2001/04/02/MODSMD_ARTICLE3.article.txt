(«l.iset said, I do not need to

I lie foui scnic>i c lass presi
dents helped create the list ol pos
sible speakers that was passed on
to the President s Office. "After
collecting voin nominations and
votes, we narrowed the list to a
small group of the most popular
nominees." Delphiue I not, one of
the senioi c lass presidents, wrote

in an e-mail.
"()ver the course ol one month,
nearly 100 individuals were nomi
nated In the class to speak at grad
uation." 1 not said. "Ol those
c hoices. the lour ol us compiled a
list of eight to ten individuals who
not only have made an impact in
society, but would also have a valu
able and motivational message to
present to us upon our exit from
Stanford. All ol the nominations
that we listed came directly from
the online submission."
She added, "We met with Pres
ident Hennessy and his assistant
on multiple occasions to discuss
possible c andidates and to under
stand the proc ess. After compiling
the list, it was given to President

Hennessy to select a speaker and
formally invite him or her."
"Reconciling the high expecta
tions inherent in these goals [ot
finding .111 inspirational speaker]
and vonr recommendations with
the schedules of extremely busv
people makes the selection
process very challenging. In the
end, this complicated process re
quires a great deal of flexibility
and complete confidentiality on
the part of the president," Hen
nessy said.
I lennessN added that he hoped
that seniors would "give this verv
committed and important Stan
foul graduate the same respect
that von yourself would hope for
and that she so richly deserves."
