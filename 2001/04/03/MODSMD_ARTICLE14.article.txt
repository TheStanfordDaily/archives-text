Blades and spears whirl and flash
through the air. Dozens ol red-shirted
students maneuver â€” legs twisting,
jumping, ducking, throwing punches
and kicks in graceful, powerful move
ments akin to a dance.
No. it's not "Crouching I'iger, Hid
den Dragon" or the latest Jackie Chan
kung iu flick. It's another I'uesdax ( lass

Wushu, whic li means "the art of fight
ing," has evolved into an aesthetic mar
tial art in which each move is grounded
in principles of traditional combat.
Wushu has many stvles, with basic
hand forms like Long list and Southern
list. More experienced students learn
how to wield weapons sm h as the broad
sword, straight sword, staff and spear.
Wong, who is best known for his
drunken list-stvle and drunken sword

Wushu for 20 vears.
A c hampion member of the I'.S. Na

and "Mace: Fhe Dark. Age."
Wong attributes ln>. success to hard
work and perseverance. "You have to lie

speed and grace," Kam said.
All the jumps, stomps and kit ks also

The students said they were all very
proud of their sport and encouraged
other students to considei joining 11 as
