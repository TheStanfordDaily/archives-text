## The 						Stanford Daily Secrecy, irresponsibility shadow Fiorina choice 
### 
Published Since IX<)1

THE ANNUAL SELECTION of the
Commencement speaker is greatly
anticipated In both (lie Stanford stu
dent bodv and the greater commu
nity. I Ins year's choice of Carly Fiorina pro
yoked angry responses from some students
and raised disturbing questions about the pro
cess behind the selection of the speaker. 1 he
process should have been and should become
more defined and consistent in order to ensure
that students and faculty feel more involved in
the selection.
Last year, seniors nominated a list of prospec
tive speakers. Forinei President (ierhard ( asper
invited the "top choice, United Nations Secre
tary Ceneral Kofi Annan. This year the process
was neither democratic nor transparent. For ex
ample, the short list of nominees given to Presi
dent John Hennessv, who made the final deci
sion, was never made available to students.
I)a\s after the announcement, I lennessv. re-

sponding to the growing fervor of complaints,
detailed the reasons for his selection of Fiorina in
a letter to the senior class. In a rather defensive
tone, Hennessv stated that he had consulted
with the senior class presidents on the list of
prospective speakers and that the presidents
raised no objections to Fiorina's inclusion in this
group.
Hennessv further defended his decision by
stating that the final responsibility regarding the
selection of the Commencement speaker rests in
the hands of the university president. In an e-mail
sent to the senior class, the class presidents denied
involvement in the decision to invite Fiorina.
From the cacophony of e-mails circulating
on campus, it appears that I lennessv alone se
lected Fiorina as the speaker, with only cursory
input from the student body. In the past, the
president has always relied on student input
for this important selection. I his year, with his
subversion of student opinion, Hennessv has

tailed to remain accountable to the student
body.
Other aspects of the selection process must
also be examined. We elect c lass presidents to
represent the student body in important deci
sions. Other decisions should and must be left
up to the singular discretion of the president,
but the annual (commencement speaker repre
sents the centerpiece of graduation dav, which is
a dav that seniors and their families will cherish.
W hv were the elected senior class presidents
and the students themselves left out of this im
portant decision?
Following the announcement of Fiorina as
the 2001 Commencement speaker, students
rushed to their computers and phones to log
their complaints. Several davs later, the senior
dass presidents responded with an e-mail of
their own, detailing their limited involvement in
the selection process and requesting students to
respond directly to the president's office with

their complaints.
l lit' senior c lass presidents shirked their
diitv to the people who elected them. I hey
were elected to represent the senior class's
interests, including the selection of the
Commencement speaker. For whatever rea
son. they were denied a louder voice in the
process, but their actions in response to the
student uproar showed a lack of responsibil
ity. Throwing one's hands up in the air is
never the way to deal with complaints or
criticism.
In light of this year's controversy, it's obvious
th.it the process In which the Commencement
speaker is chosen should become more open
and streamlined so that the problems of this
year can be avoided in the future. Hennessy
should remember tli.it graduation day cele
brates students and their accomplishments,
while the senior class presidents must remem
ber their duty to those they represent.
