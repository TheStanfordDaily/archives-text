## Is essentialism dead? 
### 
Most of vou would probably find
it a little bit odd to see a White
girl hanging out at the Black
( ommunitv Services ("enter, K1
Centre Chicano. the Native-American Ac
ii\ it its (Center or the Asian-Amet i< an At tiv
nics Center. You'd be more curious about
her reasons for being there than you would
it she were Blat k. Latino, American Indian
or Asian. Kven though coininunit\ tenters
are open to all, vou might presume that she
doesn't have a legitimate reason to be there.
Hit-re's .1 term for this mentality in race

theory, and it's ( ailed "es
sentialism.'' 1 recently
read an interesting article
111 which the author pro
nounces that essentialism
is dead. 1 don't think it is.
Kssentialism dest ribes
the wav that we link cer
tain opinions and values
to a given racial identity.
In other words, we as-

siuiie that .1 person of .1 particular rate has a set
of "essential" characteristics, and, conversely,
that .111 indi\ idual displaying that sei of "essen
tial' (harat teristit s is of a particular race.
Within .1 community of color, essential
isin is closelv linked with authenticity, l o
he .111 authentic member of .1 community.
.111 individual must resemble that commu
nity's "essential figure. I he essential fig
ure is someone who not only has the same
skin color as the rest of the community,
hut also identifies with that community's
culture .md its shared interests.
Let's consider how this works In looking
.it.in example of two well-known figures:
(londolecv/a Rice and Kminem. Rice is
lllack. but she is not is not considered au
thentically "Black because she doesn't fit
the mold of the Black essential figure. She's
.1 hard-core "free-market conservative" who
hates affirmative action and doesn't hang
with Black folks that often. Eminem, on the
otliei hand, might be considered authenti
cally "Black." even though lie's technically
White. I don't know whether or not. he sup
ports affirmative action, but he raps well,
and he hangs with NWA.
I he conflict between essential and physical
authenticity also takes plat e in other minoiitv
communities, each of which also has its own
essential figure. Is there a White essential fig
ure? Perhaps. It's difficult to pinpoint exactly
what might be a "White interest" because the
White population is far more diverse than any
minority population in terms of political opin
ion, economic status, family background, reli
gion and geographic distribution.
Though essentialism can be overly pre
sumptuous, those presumptions can be

used to serve the good ola community,
particularly 111 public polit \. I'<Â»lic \ experts
anil achocat \ groups at t on the belief that
people of the same skin color h.ive similai
opinions. II tliex didn't, mobili/ation on
sui li issues as Propositions 1 87 and 209 in
California might have been much slowet
and much less effective.
I can easily see how someone might get
the idea that essentialism is dead. If vou
were to tell me twelve months ago that, in
a \eai s time, we would have a Blat k female
national securitv advisor in .1 White I louse
controlled by .1 conservative Republican,
and that a White dude bat ked In Dr. Die
would win the Gratnim for Best Rap Solo
Performance, 1 would have told vou that
you were crazy. But if essentialism were
dead, these events wouldn't have surprised
us. Kssentialism isn't dead, but it could be
d\ing. What does this mean for us?
One thing it could mean is that it nia\
soon be time for communities of color to at -
cept the idea that some individuals won't
identify strongly with their shared interests
and ideals. The Congressional Black Cam us
isn't particularh fond of Rice, a woman who
seems to go to great lengths to avoid doing
anvthing for the Black community, but the
rise of the Black middle ( lass and Black Re
publicanism means that we will probabb see
more, not fewer, personalities like Rice.
It could also mean that it's time for
communities of color to accept those who
are physically inauthentic but essentially
authentic. It is possible that the White stu
dent in the community center might be
able to identify with the opinions and val
ues of that community. She just might
have something valuable to offer.
Communities of color will always have
an identifiable set of shared interests, but
the way that individuals within and out
side of those communities relate to those
interests is ( hanging. Rice and Kminetn
are living proof. Maybe the author of the
article I read was only partly right.
We need to embrace a new form of es
sentialism, one that allows individuals to
stray from the interests of the group with
out being stigmatized by the community.
()ur new definition should also encourage
communities of color to be more accepting
of individuals of other races w ho want to
be active, contributing members. Times
are changing. Shared interests will not
survive unless we expand our definition of
who is allowed to share them.
