First, 1 want to assure Fhe Daily that
the ( IK is committed to expanding and
diversifying the numbei of employment
resources available to students. In fact, we
have undertaken a iiuihlki of initiatives
toward this goal fin this academic year.
These efforts include:
Conducting a survey of the spring
2000 junior class to gather information on
the types of organizations they would like to
have ret i nit at Stanford. All of these organi
zations were in\ ited to participate in the Nat -

sponsored In the CDC.

tried tt) recruit .it Stanford but have Ixrn un

where the employer is located, students want
more money, students don't like the jobs
Ix itig ottered by the company or the compa
ny itself. Business sense eventually tells them
to trv elsewhere.
Most employers won't even tn to recruit
at Stanford because they are able tt) hire
qualified staff through other more inex
pensive and efficient means. Employers
would love tt) have a bright, talented, hard

working Stanford student, but then atti
tude is simply, "We'd love to have von.

These efforts include:
Conducting a survey of the spring
