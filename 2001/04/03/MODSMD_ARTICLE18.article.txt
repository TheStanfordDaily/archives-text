# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Language department merger devalues humanities 
### SARAH MONROY, CARLEEN PINO WILL TAYLOR GUEST COLUMNISTS 
We voice the frustration of the
hit ult\. students aiui alumni
from iii ross the Depart
ments of Asian Languages.
Spanish and Portuguese, Nla\u lan
guages and Literatures, French & Italian,
( >erman Studies and ('.omp.n alive 1 .itera
ture that have been demoted to "area
studies" and merged into a new depart
ment under the nameot Division of Liter
atures, Cultures and Languages. Across
the humanities and sciences, we stand
united in the beliel that this ili\ ision brings
grave consequences to out language de
partments, to out School o! Humanities
and Sciences and to the value of oui St.in
fold education. I his merger is onl\ the be
ginning of the eventual dec line of the hu
manities at Stanford.
During Dead Week of wintei quartet. the

proposal appeared before the Academic
('.ouni il just before its final stages of approval
with Provost John Ftchemendx and I niversi
t\ President John Ifeiinessv. Implementation
ot the proposal will take effect in Sept., 2001.
Siantord's administration defends the
mergei with the argument that one de
partment will make belter use of existing
i esouri es and have more power and voii e.
Hut combining resouri es will make it ilifli
i ult for each dep.u tnient to be heard or to
receive the resources it needs.
One example of this problem is that five
new professors will be sought tor the new di
\ ision. It does not take a math degree to i ec
ogni/e that if there are si\ departments and
onh fix e new professors, at least one depart
ment will not receive additional help. Five is
not six. Literature departments are not lus
toi \ departments. Someone is going to lose.
()in administration further dei lares that
the structure of tin*, new department will
allow for majors to enibai k on interdepat t
inental studies fbi a cross-cultural major.

I he- iron\ in this argument lies in the fact
that we already have excellent departments
such as (Comparative Studies in Race and
Fthnicitv. Latin American Studies and
(Comparative Literature that encourage iti
terdisciplinan studies. It one of the reasons
for the merger is the need for more efficient
allocation of resources, win. then, are we
expending more resources to create pro
grams we all each have?
I his merger is an embarrassing exam
ple ot the administration's top-down strate
gies tor handling the problems of under
funded departments. Our departments
have endured the stress of undertunding
for \ears, \ct thc\ have still managed to
produce Marshall. Rhodes and human
scholars. I lie departments' achievements
go unnotii ed as the merger now looms on
the hori/on ot 0111 education and emerges
without student and facult\ input.
Last quarter, aftei bypassing the Facul
t\ Senate with the proposal plan and dis
missing the concerns of the student bodv,

the administration tailed its proposal a
"simple administrative change" to the
structure ot the departments. 1 he Fac ult\
Senate was not permitted to vote on this
proposal because the administration felt it
was a non-academic issue. Yet, when
pressed to outline the advantages of this
merger, the reasons the administration
cites are not structural but l.n gel\ academ
ic and student-related.
Now that this ill-considered idea conies
to fruition, we recogni/.e that we are not
alone in being consolidated. He war\ ot
your own departments' vulnerability be
cause. within two vears, four more pro
grams will be sacrificed to the " 1 he Divi
sion.' While \ou were gone ovet spring
break, the administration was biis\ dei iil
ing that Latin American Studies is on its
wavout. Fheregoes Holivai House. W ho's
next.-' Hammarskjold or niavbe the
French I louse? Is voui department on the
list to go as well? We don't know for sure,
but what we do know is that if these de

pai 11Hi'ills .iiul < entei s disappcai, so does
Stanford's humanities and its diversity.
Stanford prides itself, .it least tothe pub
lic and alnnini, as being a tvpe of Utopia of
education tb.it fosters the interaction of
main different fields and disciplines 111 a
supportive environment. W'itb the collapse
of tbe language and literature depart
ments. we cannot be farther from that
Utopian m\tli. I hi is. the linnianities de
part mints u ill no longei compare to those
of tbe lv\ League schools to which vu- so
often compare ourselves.
Stanford, how long will von continue to
demoralize oin departments and sell ns
out? Students, will von tolerate iliisr
