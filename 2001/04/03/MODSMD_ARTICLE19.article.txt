### ANDY JACOB CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I he I NLA wonu'ii's tenuis team clung to a
shred of optimism last Wcdnesdax before its
match against No. I Stanford. Sure, the Car
dinal was undefeated and latch had been pro
jecting an aura of invincibilit\ reminiscent of
Michael Jordan's, but ii also hadn't played a
match in 18 days. l\yen the best teams become
.1 bit rusty after a long layoff, right?
Apparently, Stanford doesn't. 1 he Cardi
nal (17-0 overall, 0-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
delivered two of its most dominant perfor
mances at I NLV's Kertitta I ennis Complex
to earn shutouts of the No. 00 I .atl\ Rebels on
Wednesda\ and No. .'lO Brigham Young I Hi
versitv on Thursday.
Stanford got rolling early against INI A' b\

the doubles point with an victor\ ovei
Urska Radauovoic and BrittaCahl.

nationally, eked out an 8-0 win against
I NLV's Marianne Bakken and Ann Hazd
siosmanovic.
llie Cardinal Ihul no problems in singles.
It took all six mate lies, thereby securing the 7-
0 tea in victory. Cranville, the nation's top
ranked singles plaver. received a minor scare
from |ones early in the No. I match. |oncs
found herself up a service break, 4-2, and was
just two games from stealing the first set. Re
alit\ soon set in, though, and Cranville won
the final 10 games en route to a 0-1, 0-0 \ icto
ry. In the end, the Lady Rebels could onl\
muster one set — a testament to the over
powering nature of Stanford's win. I NLV's
loss dropped ii to 1-8 overall.
Stanford carried its momentum from
Wednesday's match into 1 hursday s match
against B\ I . Just as it did against I NLV.the
( arclinal swept the doubles matches from the
Cougars. Highlighting the doubles competi
tion was the No. 1 match that pitted Barnikow

didn't flinch in the face o! some quality com
petition, though, and scored an impressive 8-
1 \ic lot \. Barnikow and Kalvai ia improved to
20-3 on the season with the win.
I hursdav's singles competition proved to
be as lopsided as the doubles. Stantbrd won
all six mate lie s to note Ii its second shutout in
as main da\s. Although the Cougars (8-7)
boast more talent than the Lad\ Rebels do.
ilicv too managed to win just one set from the
( animal.

rii;it set was the second one of the No. 0
singles match between I'estieau and Kli/aveta
Khondoiarova. Pestieau won the first set. 0-.'t,
l)ut Khondoiarova bounced back to win the
set oncl >et. 0-4. Since Stanford had already se
enred the team vk ton b\ that point, Pestieau
aiul Rhoiidoi.irov.i plaved .1 tiebreaker to de
cide the match. Pestiean won th.tt tiebreaker
in dramatic fashion. 10-8.
Stanford head coach Lele Forood was
pleased with her team's performance after
such .1 long break from competition.
"Not dropping anv matches in Las Vegas
w.is .1 very nice result. F.vervone plaved well,"
Forood said. "The difficulty in these matches
was being ready to plav mentally. It's hard to
put together good points after exams and
nine d.i\ s off from pr.u t i< e. Doubles also tends
to be .t little behind after .1 layoff because the
teams are a little out of svne."

I he I NLA wonu'ii's tenuis team clung to a
shred of optimism last Wcdnesdax before its
match against No. I Stanford. Sure, the Car
dinal was undefeated and latch had been pro
jecting an aura of invincibilit\ reminiscent of
Michael Jordan's, but ii also hadn't played a
match in 18 days. l\yen the best teams become
.1 bit rusty after a long layoff, right?
Apparently, Stanford doesn't. 1 he Cardi
nal (17-0 overall, 0-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
delivered two of its most dominant perfor
mances at I NLV's Kertitta I ennis Complex
to earn shutouts of the No. 00 I .atl\ Rebels on
Wednesda\ and No. .'lO Brigham Young I Hi
versitv on Thursday.
Stanford got rolling early against INI A' b\
winning all three doubles matt lies. 1 he top
ranked duo of freshman Lauren Barnikow
and junior Lauren kalvaria defeated Paulina
Janus and Agnies/ka Abram, 8-.S, at No. I
doubles. At No. It doubles, |unior Keiko
lokuda and senior Sarah Pcstieau dim bed
the doubles point with an victor\ ovei
Urska Radauovoic and BrittaCahl.
1 lie <»ii 1 \ ( lose doubles man Ii came at the
No. 2 spot, here senior I .aura (ii an\ ille and
junior (>abriela I .astra, who ai e i .inked No. 2

nationally, eked out an 8-0 win against
I NLV's Marianne Bakken and Ann Hazd
siosmanovic.
llie Cardinal Ihul no problems in singles.
It took all six mate lies, thereby securing the 7-
0 tea in victory. Cranville, the nation's top
ranked singles plaver. received a minor scare
from |ones early in the No. I match. |oncs
found herself up a service break, 4-2, and was
just two games from stealing the first set. Re
alit\ soon set in, though, and Cranville won
the final 10 games en route to a 0-1, 0-0 \ icto
ry. In the end, the Lady Rebels could onl\
muster one set — a testament to the over
powering nature of Stanford's win. I NLV's
loss dropped ii to 1-8 overall.
Stanford carried its momentum from
Wednesday's match into 1 hursday s match
against B\ I . Just as it did against I NLV.the
( arclinal swept the doubles matches from the
Cougars. Highlighting the doubles competi
tion was the No. 1 match that pitted Barnikow
and Kalvaria against No. 22 Brooke Ferne\
and Jodi Richardson. 1 lie Cardinal duo
didn't flinch in the face o! some quality com
petition, though, and scored an impressive 8-
1 \ic lot \. Barnikow and Kalvai ia improved to
20-3 on the season with the win.
I hursdav's singles competition proved to
be as lopsided as the doubles. Stantbrd won
all six mate lie s to note Ii its second shutout in
as main da\s. Although the Cougars (8-7)
boast more talent than the Lad\ Rebels do.
ilicv too managed to win just one set from the
( animal.

rii;it set was the second one of the No. 0
singles match between I'estieau and Kli/aveta
Khondoiarova. Pestieau won the first set. 0-.'t,
l)ut Khondoiarova bounced back to win the
set oncl >et. 0-4. Since Stanford had already se
enred the team vk ton b\ that point, Pestieau
aiul Rhoiidoi.irov.i plaved .1 tiebreaker to de
cide the match. Pestiean won th.tt tiebreaker
in dramatic fashion. 10-8.
Stanford head coach Lele Forood was
pleased with her team's performance after
such .1 long break from competition.
"Not dropping anv matches in Las Vegas
w.is .1 very nice result. F.vervone plaved well,"
Forood said. "The difficulty in these matches
was being ready to plav mentally. It's hard to
put together good points after exams and
nine d.i\ s off from pr.u t i< e. Doubles also tends
to be .t little behind after .1 layoff because the
teams are a little out of svne."
