# GSB retains No. 1 ranking
## Schools of law, education, engineering all ranked second by U.S. News 
### NICHOLAS CHAN STAFF WRITER 
Ihe Graduate School of Business
topped I .S. News and World Report's
list of the c ountry's best business si hools,
released yesterday. Stanford .ilso
tanked in the top five m hools in three <>112
the other tour graduate programs that
the niaga/ine evaluates annually.
U.S. News ranks the top schools in
five areas: business, engineering, law,
education and medic inc. The medicine
calegon is divided into research and
prinian < are sub< ategories.
Stanfoitl ranked second in the edu
cation. engineering and law ratings.
Compared to othet medical research
schools, Stanford ranked ninth, and it
did uoi rank among the medical prima
r\ care schools.
Robert |oss, dean of the (iSH, re
sponded oositiveb to the rankings, not

ing that the rankings are not an ab
solute standard ot compai ison.
"While, at some level, we are pleased
to occup\ the top spot, we understand
ili.it the rankings reflect the specific
inethodolog\ used b\ I S. News. |oss
said.

In the p.lst. other surveys from
some cs sue li .ts tlu- Financ i.il 1 imes and
Business Week have rated the CSB in
spots ranging from third to 11th. I S
News has tanked the (iSB first in five of


NF MIl DALAI/The Stanford Daily
the previous six years.
"Ultimately, what is most im
portant is that we continue to
sti ive to ensure the Stanford (iSB
is the leading academic school of
management in the world," Joss
concluded.
New Medical School Dean Phil
Pi/v.o agreed that the rankings are
aflec ted In c ertain characteristics.
"Because Stanford is a relative
ly small medical school, it will
never have the same depth or
level of funding and thus is effect
ed In < omparison to larger institu
tions," Pl//0 said. "()n a per facul
ty basis, Stanford actually ranks at
the verv top of the list in peer-re
viewed research funding. There is
every reason to believe that Stan
ford can become the premier re
search-intensive medical school in
the nation in the years ahead."
The maga/ine ranked Har
vard's education program. Ml Is
engineering program and Yale's
law s< hool as the best in the conn

try. It also ranked Harvard's
medical school as the best tor re
search and the University of
Washington's medical school as
the best for primary care.
I he maga/ine also ranks less
attended graduate programs on a
rotating basis. I his year, the mag
a/ine ranked doctoral programs
in the physical sciences, soci.il sci
ences and the humanities.
It also evaluated master's pro
grams in health sciences and pub
lic affairs.
Stanford's doctoral programs
placed or tied for first iti biology,
computer science, Knglish,
physics and psychology.
Kach program in the five tnaj<>l
areas was evaluated subjectively
and objectively. The subjective
score was based on the programs'
reputation. I lie objective score
was based on the student bod\ of
each school.
To obtain the reputation rat
ing, U.S. News surveyed deans,
program directors and senior fat -
uity members from each school.
These academics ranked their
school on a scale of one to five
based on the overall academic

qualitx of its programs. In addi
tion. professionals and field ex
perts unaffiliated with the school
were asked to name the top 2f>
schools in their field.
I he statistic al 1 ating contained
two components. The input com
ponent was based on the students
entering the graduate program.
Standardized test scores and un
dergraduate (il'A comprised
most of this area.
I he second part of the statisti
cal rating xvas tlie output compo
nent, which was based on stu
dents' statistics after graduation.
These statistics include starting
salarx and passing rates for post
giaduate s<hool tests su< h as bai
exams.
These txvo ratings were com
bined to reai ha final overall tank
ing. The scores of all the schools
xve re then standardized so that the
gap between schools in areas sue h
as budget and si/c were lessened
but still noticeable.
U.S. News cautions readers
against completelx reiving on its
rankings to choose a graduate
school. While the magazine at
tempts to show comparisons be

tween schools as xvcll as the po
tential ioi success, it acknowl
edges that it omits main personal
factors that could be crucial to
making a final decision.
1 he rankings clo go beyond
the five basic categories, though.
I he law school index includes a
diversity index, for example. Ac -
cording to the magazine's Web
site, this index was created for
"individuals applying to law
school who place importance on
learning with people of different
backgrounds."
For each of the five major cat
egories, deans and program
heads also named the 10 best
programs 111 specialized areas of
each category.
I hese areas include ac count
ing and cntrepreneurship for
business schools and chemical
and agricultural engineering for
engineering schools. I hese fields
are popular, but not every school
offers them.
I .S. Ncxvs changed the format
of the educational rankings this

more on how well education pro
grams prepare teachers.
