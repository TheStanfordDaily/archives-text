# Devils burn Cardinal's 10-game winning tear
## Despite loss, No. 1 Stanford still takes 2-of-3 from Arizona State 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
A tc\illl has to lose once in .1 while, doesn't it?
()ne would think so.
But until its narrow (>-5 loss to No. b Arizona State
on Sunda\. the top-ranked ('.ardinal (24-0, 5-1 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) looked as though it wasn't about to
give up another game fora while. Stanford had a 10-
game winning streak intact, having gone undefeated
111 spring break games against Washington and Saint
Man s. .ind it had handilv kmx ked of! the Sun Devils
(21 -9-1. Pac-10) in the first two games of last week
end's series.
Furthermore, pitchers sophomore |eretny
Cutlnie (7-0) and junior |ell Bruksch ((>-()) had con
tinued then solid pitching on Friday and Saturday,
pacing the (.ardinal in 0-2 and ">-2 victories at Packard
Stadium 111 Fempe, Ariz. And thanks to a mid-inning
comeback on Sunday, sophomore Tim Cunningham
earned a no-decision after 3 1/3 innings of work,
keeping the starting pitching rotation undefeated
with a 17-0 record.
So, all in all, it was not a bad stretch fora team that
has been surpassing every expectation — a team that
lias now won 22 of its last 25 games, and one that has
won 15 consecutive regulai season series dating back
to last year.
1 he loss 011 Sunday, then? Mavbe the realization
that c lasses were once again looming on the horizon
was enough to throw the squad off a bit.
For just .1 game, at least.
The Sun Devils captured their first lead of the se
ries earK 111 the- rubber game on Sunday when ( asev
Mvers hit a two-iun home run in the first inning.
I railing 1-1. the ('.ardinal scored three runs in the
top of the fifth inning. Sophomore Ryan Carko
scored on .1 double In junior Jason YanMeetren, and

junior Arik VanZandt made it to home plate on the
same plav after an error by Sun Devil centerficldcr
(In is Duffy. Van Meet ren later scored when junioi
And\ Topham grounded into a fielder's < hoicc, t\ ing
the game at four.
Alter tailing behind again, (>-4, in the seventh in
ning. freshman ('.arlos Quentin led oil the eighth with
<t solo home run in an attempt m lead .i Stanford
comeback. It was Quentin's fourth home inn of the
season. Yet the (Cardinal was unable to store with a
runner in scoring position Liter in the inning, and
then went down in order in the ninth to lose for the
first time since March 3.
Quentin was certainly the team's biggest asset in
the seven games played over the past week. I lie
freshman right fielder finished the Washington se
ries 7-for-l I with a home run and five RBI, added
another RBI in an 8-M win over Saint Man's, and
then was 4-fbr-10 with two RBI and a home run
against AS I .
"('.arlos has played great," said head coach Mark
Marquess. "You can't get him out with am one par
ticular pitch. He's going to be a great player toi us and
get nothing but better."
The hot hitting by Quentin could not have been
more timely either, considering the loss of sophomore
designated hitter Jason C.oopcr, who is still out ol the
lineup due to an ailing knee. Quentin has filled the
void at the cleanup spot and now leads the team \\ itli
,i."MY 2 batting average.
Moreover, unlike the team's winning streak,
Quentin's hitting tear did not come to an end on Sun
day. He went 2-for-H and extended Ins hitting streak
to 10 games. Quentin was the only Cardinal batter
with more than one hit on the day.
And. as if the clutch performance bv a freshman
has not been enough, junior Andy I bpham lias made
Ins earlv-season slump at the plate seem like a distant
memory, reeling off a 10-game streak of his own.
Since his walk-off grand slain that rapped off a sweep
of Southern (California, [opium has gone 9-fbr-28 and
