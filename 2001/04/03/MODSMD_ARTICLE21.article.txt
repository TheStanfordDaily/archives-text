And the battle lupins.
Stanford jumped out to a strong start in
tlu- toughest league in the nation with a
stunning 1-0 victory against top-ranked
t ( IA Friday. But, in an affirmation of the
Pacific 10 Conference's strength, a day
later Stanford lost to No. I"> Washington 5-
1 before exacting revenge with a 4-1 win of
its own.
Every year, the Pacific 10 Conference

dominates national Softball plav. (lurrentlv
the number one, two, three, five, nine, 14
and 15 teams in the nation are from the
Rk-10.
"The Pac-10 is unique in that every
game is against a ranked opponent," said
Stanford head coach John Rittan. "You are
getting tested by the best everyday."
The No. 5 Cardinal (82-3-1) was tested
for the first time this past weekend as it
kicked off its conference season when it
took on No. 1 UCLA (37-1) and No. 15
Washington (24-12).

In its first game of the weekend, the
Stanford softball team ended I ClA's 35-
game pie-conference undefeated streak.
The Cardinal's I -0 victory served .is a rude
awakening for I CLA, and a tribute to the
unparalleled strength of the Pat-10.
Sophomore Dana Sorensen led the
Stanford squad from the circle as she
pitched her 11th shutout ofthe year, giving
uponly two hits. The All-American was fat -
ing a Bruin lineup that previously Ixiasted
a .371 team batting average. Sorensen suc
cessfully kept LCI A off balance as she al

lowed onl\ four base runnel sand kept the
Bruins from rcailiing past se< <>n<l base.

heating them."
