# 'Shine' of money continues to taint NCAA Tournament
## 
### 
After Duke walked off the floor with
a national title in hand and the
post-game montage presented
the NCAA's "One Shining Mo
ment" to the world, manv no doubt c laimed
thi' past three weeks of March Madness rep
resented the vcr\ best in collegiate athletic s.
Don't believe it.
I'hough similar problems plague other
collegiate sports, the N( AVs hvpoeris\ cov
ers the men's college basketball tournament
like the stale, sweet smell of old champagne.
As the manv stories of humanity, heart
break and triumph played out on a 04-by-

50 piece of hardwood ar
guably make the tourna
ment America's favorite
sporting event, March
Madness is the NCAA's
shining moment mostly
because ot its $(i billion
plus deal with ( bS.
So as the N( AA puts
on Match Madness with
all ot the pomp and

hoopla to entertain its corporate sponsors
it continues to smugly den\ that the organi
zation is solely about money.

-1 he NCAA's claims and denials are as
ridiculous as teen pinups Britney Spears
and Anna kournikova repeated claims ot
sexual puritv.
Sure, Spears and Kournikova may be
telling the truth, just like the NCAA may re
all\ c are about the student and the person
over the athlete. Hut, like the two starlets'
oversexed, commercially com ions public
images, the NCAA's hypocritical actions
prove that it is also a whore to money.
It is outrageous that the NCAA treats its
student-athletes unfairly by not paying
them, exploiting them and then tearing

them down.
It is downright unacceptable that the
N( A\ continues to lie about it by claiming,
like Spears and Kournikoya, that it is inno
cent and pure.
file tnessv trail of hypocrisy does not
end — even dubbing these athletes to be
student-athletes is questionable.
I lu se are athlete-students, forced to
make mone\ tor the NCAA while studying
in hotels and traveling c ross-country din
ing final exams.
So it these students are treated solely as
athletes to make the N( A\extremely pre»t

itahle, then win not pay the athletes?
While the idea has been gathering
steam, just mentioning it makes NCAA offi
cials claim heresy. Cedric Deinpsey, the
head ol the NCAA, just reiterated this
weekend that he would never be in favor of
either an athlete's union or increased
stipends. He and other "traditionalists"
claim th.it most athletes already have full
st holarships and should not be treated dif
feienth than the biologv major that lives
down the hall.
