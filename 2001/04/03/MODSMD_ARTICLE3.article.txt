ment chairs. rhc\ urged people who found
graffiti to "immediately call 911"
and "take no steps to remove the
graffiti" so that it could l>e preserved
as evidence.
"We find it very disappointing
.ind vei"v sad that there are those few
bigoted people that feel it necessarv
to express themselves in this fash
ion." C 'ordell said.
lipton said the crime was Ix'ing
investigated as vandalism, whit h is a
misdemeanor. The classificition as a
hate ciime could increase the sevcii
tv of the sentence if the perpetrator
is convicted. Sentences would range
from probation to fines to jail time.
"It makes no difference until it
comes time for sentencing," l ipton
said.
('.ordell said that the act targets
not just those .it whom the slurs
were directed, but the entire l iii
versity community.
"It is offensive not onlv to the
group that is targeted." she said, "it
is an assault on all ol us. Attention
has to be paid."
According to Cordell, these t\ pes
of acts are difficult to prevent and
often difficult to prosecute. She said
the vandals are usualK ( aught onlv
when the\ are seen in the ad or
when thev leave a signature. She
said the onlv thing the I niversity
c an do is respond promptly, as it did
in this situation.
"It takes <i coward to do this."
('.ordell said.

(ordell said she had seen similar
cases in her experience as a judge.
She described three types of people
who were prone to this tvpe of act.
I'hev were "people who are desper
ate for attention, people who arc
mean, hateful, bigoted individuals'
and people who feel threatened In
the glowing numbers of minorities
in the United States and especialh
(lalifbrnia.
"We need to know more about
the individual to make a totally in
formed judgment," (ordell said.
"Kvery case has tobe looked at on an
individual basis."
According to Asst. Communica
tions Prof . I .aura 1-eets. who studies
bate speech, the effects of these acts
can vary.
"Some speech will Ixnince off
people." she said. "Some words will
cause an eni(itional rcsjx>nse. There
are a lot of mediating variables."
Often, people respond to this
speech in three stages. Ix-ets said.
First, thev respond emotionally. sec
ond, t hex respond attitudinall\. and
.third, they respond behavioi aIK.
l.cctss research focuses on
"restorative justice," or wavs of
restoring the rights of the victims
of hate speech. She said the 112 irst
Amendment limits how speech
(.in be legislated, but there are
other wavs to restore the sense of
community.

Noothei incidents of ibis type havelx'en
reported to the police since Marc li 'JO.
I niversitv President (ohn Hennessy and
\'ice I'rovost fbi ( ainpus Relations UiDoris
Cordell responded to the incident in a
Mat ( li 22 e-mail sent to cleans and depart
ment chairs. rhc\ urged people who found
graffiti to "immediately call 911"
and "take no steps to remove the
graffiti" so that it could l>e preserved
as evidence.
"We find it very disappointing
.ind vei"v sad that there are those few
bigoted people that feel it necessarv
to express themselves in this fash
ion." C 'ordell said.
lipton said the crime was Ix'ing
investigated as vandalism, whit h is a
misdemeanor. The classificition as a
hate ciime could increase the sevcii
tv of the sentence if the perpetrator
is convicted. Sentences would range
from probation to fines to jail time.
"It makes no difference until it
comes time for sentencing," l ipton
said.
('.ordell said that the act targets
not just those .it whom the slurs
were directed, but the entire l iii
versity community.
"It is offensive not onlv to the
group that is targeted." she said, "it
is an assault on all ol us. Attention
has to be paid."
According to Cordell, these t\ pes
of acts are difficult to prevent and
often difficult to prosecute. She said
the vandals are usualK ( aught onlv
when the\ are seen in the ad or
when thev leave a signature. She
said the onlv thing the I niversity
c an do is respond promptly, as it did
in this situation.
"It takes <i coward to do this."
('.ordell said.

(ordell said she had seen similar
cases in her experience as a judge.
She described three types of people
who were prone to this tvpe of act.
I'hev were "people who are desper
ate for attention, people who arc
mean, hateful, bigoted individuals'
and people who feel threatened In
the glowing numbers of minorities
in the United States and especialh
(lalifbrnia.
"We need to know more about
the individual to make a totally in
formed judgment," (ordell said.
"Kvery case has tobe looked at on an
individual basis."
According to Asst. Communica
tions Prof . I .aura 1-eets. who studies
bate speech, the effects of these acts
can vary.
"Some speech will Ixnince off
people." she said. "Some words will
cause an eni(itional rcsjx>nse. There
are a lot of mediating variables."
Often, people respond to this
speech in three stages. Ix-ets said.
First, thev respond emotionally. sec
ond, t hex respond attitudinall\. and
.third, they respond behavioi aIK.
l.cctss research focuses on
"restorative justice," or wavs of
restoring the rights of the victims
of hate speech. She said the 112 irst
Amendment limits how speech
(.in be legislated, but there are
other wavs to restore the sense of
community.
fx'ets has created an online sur
vey for the Stanford community
about the effects of the speech. I lie
suiAev contains pic tures of some of
the written graffiti. It can be found
