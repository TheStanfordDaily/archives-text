Second-veai law student Matthew

said'the main objet tive is "to raise visi
bility and awareness of queei issues at
Stanford and in the largci Ha\ Area.
At (ortling to S.inders, the event has
something to offer all Stanford stu
dents. not |iisi those who belong to the
queer community.
"[Queer Awareness Davs] isn't ir\-
ing to deal with problems in the tjueer
community," he s.iid, "ft is living to
showcase a lot of different perspectives
in the queer community, and.in that

sense, it is tr\ ing to celebrate the diver
sity of the tjueer community."
Sanders said that the organized ac
tivities t an at t as .1 supplemental form
of education beta use thev are "de
signed to fill some gaps in ilit- I niversi
t\ programming and in the t lasses."
According to Sanders, the renown
of the speakers is also key.Me said the
event prov ides the Stanford t'onununi
tv with the opportunitx "to hear some
realh cool speakers who are talking
about interesting things that pertain to
all kinds of people."
Queer Awareness bavs this year was
organized with the help of HO volun
teers and an eight-person steering
< onunittee. I he committee had the re
sponsibility of inviting speakers. De
spite the unavailahilit\ of several in
tended speakers, the committee was
able to assemble a group of six speak
ers, all well known in their individual
fields.
Dana Rivet s, a transgender activist,
will speak tomoi row on the complexity

of human sexuality and the reasons for
supporting transgender inclusion. Hei
talk is titled, "Clender I)anc ing: I he Bi
nar\ Mvth."
On Friday, loin Shepanl, a docu
mentary filmmaker, will be presenting
his latest film, "Scout's Honor," which
is scheduled to air on PBS this June.
1 lie film portrays the Bo\ Stouts' dis
crimination polio against gay scouts
and the subsequent tight against that
disc rimination.
David Sedaris, .111 author and come
dian, will speak on Saturday, April 7.
I nlike the othei speakers. Sedaris says
little about his sexuality, which many
sa\ makes his perspective on queer is
sues unique.
() 11 Monday, Keith Bovkin, .111
African-American activist and author,
will be sharing his views on queer is
sues. particularly on the treatment of
racial minorities hv queer ac tivists.

Rolling along
Shannon McPherson of Foothill College rollerblades outside of Meyer Library as his friend
David Robertson looks on.
.it Queer Awareness Days last
year, will again entertain students
with her wit while .ilso imparting
personal insight on queer issues.
Finally, author Andrew Sulli
van, a practicing Catholic who
challenges the C .lunch's position
on queer issues, will discuss a va
riety of controversial issues from
gav rights to same-sex marriage.
In addition to hosting several
renowned speakers, the Lesbian
I'.av Bisexual and Fransgender
Community Center has orga
nized two more events. First, the
LCBTCC, in coordination with
An Art Affair, is presenting a
queer art showcase in White IMaz.a
on Thursday, April 12.
The other event is a non-profit
career panel whose panelists will
share insight from their experi
ences .iikl highlight various as
pects of their work. Sanders said
that the panel is not just for those

who wish to perform non-profit
work but also for "anyone who is
interested in [queer issues]."
According to Sanders, the
most challenging aspect of coor
dinating the event was raising
money. Sophomore Jimmy
Renteria, this year's tundraising
chair, led the effort to raise the
roughly $35,000 necessary to or
ganize the event. Although it is
primarily funded by the
LCBTCC, additional financial as
sistance tame from various other
groups.
According to sophomore
Natasha Li, the publicity chair,
everyone should attend one or
more of the events because the
speakers "have interesting expe
riences to share which can broad
en your perspective on the
world."
Queer Awareness Days hits Ixm
publicized throughout the Bay Area
on various television and radio
shows, as well as in regional news
papers. For more information, visit

"[Queer Awareness Davs] isn't ir\-
ing to deal with problems in the tjueer
community," he s.iid, "ft is living to
showcase a lot of different perspectives
in the queer community, and.in that

sense, it is tr\ ing to celebrate the diver
sity of the tjueer community."
Sanders said that the organized ac
tivities t an at t as .1 supplemental form
of education beta use thev are "de
signed to fill some gaps in ilit- I niversi
t\ programming and in the t lasses."
According to Sanders, the renown
of the speakers is also key.Me said the
event prov ides the Stanford t'onununi
tv with the opportunitx "to hear some
realh cool speakers who are talking
about interesting things that pertain to
all kinds of people."
Queer Awareness bavs this year was
organized with the help of HO volun
teers and an eight-person steering
< onunittee. I he committee had the re
sponsibility of inviting speakers. De
spite the unavailahilit\ of several in
tended speakers, the committee was
able to assemble a group of six speak
ers, all well known in their individual
fields.
Dana Rivet s, a transgender activist,
will speak tomoi row on the complexity

of human sexuality and the reasons for
supporting transgender inclusion. Hei

crimination polio against gay scouts
and the subsequent tight against that
disc rimination.
David Sedaris, .111 author and come
dian, will speak on Saturday, April 7.
I nlike the othei speakers. Sedaris says
little about his sexuality, which many
sa\ makes his perspective on queer is
sues unique.

African-American activist and author,
will be sharing his views on queer is
sues. particularly on the treatment of

year, will again entertain students
with her wit while .ilso imparting
personal insight on queer issues.
Finally, author Andrew Sulli
van, a practicing Catholic who
challenges the C .lunch's position
on queer issues, will discuss a va
riety of controversial issues from
gav rights to same-sex marriage.
In addition to hosting several
renowned speakers, the Lesbian
I'.av Bisexual and Fransgender
Community Center has orga
nized two more events. First, the
LCBTCC, in coordination with
An Art Affair, is presenting a
queer art showcase in White IMaz.a
on Thursday, April 12.
The other event is a non-profit
career panel whose panelists will
share insight from their experi
ences .iikl highlight various as
pects of their work. Sanders said
that the panel is not just for those

who wish to perform non-profit
work but also for "anyone who is
interested in [queer issues]."
According to Sanders, the
most challenging aspect of coor
dinating the event was raising
money. Sophomore Jimmy
Renteria, this year's tundraising
chair, led the effort to raise the
roughly $35,000 necessary to or
ganize the event. Although it is
primarily funded by the
LCBTCC, additional financial as
sistance tame from various other
groups.
According to sophomore
Natasha Li, the publicity chair,
everyone should attend one or
more of the events because the
speakers "have interesting expe
riences to share which can broad
en your perspective on the
world."
Queer Awareness Days hits Ixm
publicized throughout the Bay Area
on various television and radio
shows, as well as in regional news
papers. For more information, visit
