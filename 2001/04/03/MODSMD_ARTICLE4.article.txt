l oi over two di e .nil s. Stanford stu
dents have 01 ganized Queei Awareness
I).t\s during tlu* first two weeks of Api it
to inform the campus comuumit\ about
queei issues that pertain to life on < atn
pus and in general. Although the fiist
organi/ed event is not until tomorrow,
this veai's event oflicialh began vestcr
da\ and ends I ridav, April I'l.
Second-veai law student Matthew
Sanders is the dim toi of the event. I le
said'the main objet tive is "to raise visi
bility and awareness of queei issues at
Stanford and in the largci Ha\ Area.
At (ortling to S.inders, the event has
something to offer all Stanford stu
dents. not |iisi those who belong to the
queer community.
"[Queer Awareness Davs] isn't ir\-
ing to deal with problems in the tjueer
community," he s.iid, "ft is living to
showcase a lot of different perspectives
in the queer community, and.in that

sense, it is tr\ ing to celebrate the diver
sity of the tjueer community."
Sanders said that the organized ac
tivities t an at t as .1 supplemental form
of education beta use thev are "de
signed to fill some gaps in ilit- I niversi
t\ programming and in the t lasses."
According to Sanders, the renown
of the speakers is also key.Me said the
event prov ides the Stanford t'onununi
tv with the opportunitx "to hear some
realh cool speakers who are talking
about interesting things that pertain to
all kinds of people."
Queer Awareness bavs this year was
organized with the help of HO volun
teers and an eight-person steering
< onunittee. I he committee had the re
sponsibility of inviting speakers. De
spite the unavailahilit\ of several in
tended speakers, the committee was
able to assemble a group of six speak
ers, all well known in their individual
fields.
Dana Rivet s, a transgender activist,
will speak tomoi row on the complexity

of human sexuality and the reasons for
supporting transgender inclusion. Hei
talk is titled, "Clender I)anc ing: I he Bi
nar\ Mvth."
On Friday, loin Shepanl, a docu
mentary filmmaker, will be presenting
his latest film, "Scout's Honor," which
is scheduled to air on PBS this June.
1 lie film portrays the Bo\ Stouts' dis
crimination polio against gay scouts
and the subsequent tight against that
disc rimination.
David Sedaris, .111 author and come
dian, will speak on Saturday, April 7.
I nlike the othei speakers. Sedaris says
little about his sexuality, which many
sa\ makes his perspective on queer is
sues unique.
() 11 Monday, Keith Bovkin, .111
African-American activist and author,
will be sharing his views on queer is
sues. particularly on the treatment of
racial minorities hv queer ac tivists.
