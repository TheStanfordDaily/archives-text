NEWTON'S
THKEE LAWS OF
GRADUATION
1 laving postulated the tirst two Laws ot
Graduation, Isaac Newton the grad student
was still perplexed by this paradox: It indeed
the tirst two Laws accounted tor the forces
which delayed graduation, why doesn't
explicit awareness ot these forces allow a
grad student to graduate.'
It is believed that Newton practically aban
doned his graduate research in ("elestial
Mechanics to pursue this paradox and
develop his 1 hird Law.
THIRD LAW
"For every action towirds
graduation there is an equal and
opposite distraction"
' I "his Law states that, regardless ot the nature
ot the interaction with the advisor, every
force tor productivity acting on a grad
student is accompanied by an equal and
opposing useless activity such that the net
advancement in thesis progress is zero.
Newton's Laws ot Graduation were ultimately
shown to be an approximation ot the more
complete description of Graduation Mecha
nics given by Einstein's Special 1 heory ot
Research Inactivity.
Einstein's theory, developed during his gra
duate work in Zurich, explains the general
phenomena that, relative to the grad student,
time slows down to nearly a standstill.
