F( )l\ 111 RFF AN 1) .i lull \ears, this war s se
niors have looked oxer ilu* cadre of highly
sin u and influential people who have
addressed previous graduating classes and
wondered who the\ would have lor their cereinonv.
When this veai's speaker. ( .111\ Fic>rina, chief execu
tive officer of I lewlett-l'ac kai cl. was announced,
manv on campus let out an exasperated sigh or,
worse, rushed to their computer or phone to log a
hasty message to whomever would listen. I he situa
tion has heen handled reprehensibh In all sides, and
that has unfortuuateK dwarfed the excitement sur
rounding the sele< 11011 of .1 qualified and important
woman tohe( oininencement speaker.
Most of t he e-mails circulating in response to Fio
rina's selec lion f«h us on the tec hnological aspeel ol
her job, which main students s.i\ (atei s to the tech
nological section of c ainpus. While this knee-jet k re
action seems correct, closei examination <>l I'iori
na s backgrc mud reveals an impressive, well-rc»uiid-

ee 1 woman behind the computers. Fiorina focused
her studies 011 the humanities as a Stanford nuclei -
graduate, vet she works in a tec hnical field. This
combination gives her .1 unique perspective th.it
main Stanford students (.111 relate to in their own
fbravs into the working woi Id.
Perusing the list of famous Stanford graduates,
Kiorina certainly belongs on it. As the (T.( )of one of
the world's most successful companies, she is consid
ered one of the most powerful women in the business
world. She is also a Stanford graduate w ho majored
111 philosophv and medieval studies. Her list of ac
complishments easil\ wai rants consideration for tile
prestigious honor of speaking at ( omnienc ement.
While Stanford and Silicon Valle\ have been
transformed In the tec hnological revolution, (0111-
niencenient speakers have not always reflet ted 1 his
change. 111 the past four sears, none of the speakers
had a technical or business background. Stanford
rests at the crossroads of research in both the hu

inanities and the tec hnological fields, and Fiorina is
a person special!) qualified to comment on Stan
ford's unique position in this changing world.
Another of the complaints leveled against the
choice centered on the proxiniitv of Hewlett-
Packard to Stanford. Hewlett-Packard max Ik- a
Ich al company, but it has business interests through
out the wot Id and stands prominent l\ as the par ex
emplar of philanthropic and sex ial excellence in the
business world, giving billions of dollars to charita
ble and funds that bring 11111 c h need
ed aid to the world. Fiorina has stated that one of
her g< >als is to continue the compam s rich tradition
of philanthropic wot k throughout the world.
I lie student boeh should also reflect on its own ac
tions during this debate. From the moment the
speakei w.is announced, e-mails Hooded in with in
spired Iren/v. Kxpressing discontent and confusion,
the e-mails I ailed to address underlying emotions and
feelings. Mam of the complaints not-so-subth

danced around the basic feeling: disappointment that
we didn't get someone better. 1 he e-mails, while not
directl\ suiting that Fiorina was not good enough, ex
pressed feelings of entitlement and expectation that
usualh hides stealthily below the Stanford Foothills.
II ()xlord gets Michael Jackson and 112 larvard gets
Bono, then, because we are better than 1 larvard and
Oxford — am other school — we should get (hk!
himself. But. if he's busy, then we'll settle fora former
president or world leader, but only this year. I he lack
of clear and consistent objections to Fiorina found in
the complaints demonstrate .in arrogance that is dis
appointing and unbecoming of Stanford students.
Students should look forward to Fiorina's speech.
She is an impressive woman who graduated from
Stanford and is ( F( )of a world-c lass company While
there might alwavs be someone considered "better"
out there, we should be more appreciative of Fiorina's
ac coniplishments and the resulting wisdom she could
impart upon us.
