Fiorina choice 'shows nervousness'
about Stanford's future
I find it highl\ significant that the last
quarter of this, the inaugural academic
vear of a new millennium, should begin
with a controversy on the most em
blematic of a university's symbolic ges
tures: thei hoic eof the( onuneiKement
speaker.
I he contrast with last year's speaker,
the I tilted Nations secretary-general, is
more than baffling. Kofi Annan c attic with
a clear message: Save the environment
and press vour representatives to take ac -
Hon before it's 100 late. What can we possi
bly expect Fiorina to sav? I li.it scietu e and
business are twin souls who fell in love at
Stanford and are destined to live happilv
ever after? Bv the time she reaches the
stand, in tnid-|une, the stock market crash
w ill leave her no other message to convex
than. "We failed."
But it is the I niversit\ president's un
professional "manufac turing of consent"
and ch agging student representatives into
the pool of predetermined dec isions that
has rightly attracted wide c riticism. An en
trepreuner himself. Stanford's new presi
dent is not merely "pro-business,"' he
deeply believes that "this is the only way to
go." (Indeed, his swift move to the presi
dency cannot be dissociated from a certain
Sl3O million donation to the I niversitv.)

nione\, the kind <»l sustenance onh corpo

More often than not, truth is what we
don't like to he.tr: what pierces our vanit\;
what offends om prcjudic cs. And the truth
in this i ase is what lot met I niversitx Pres

time and again: Stanford is leading a

shrewd investment in stocks that made this
