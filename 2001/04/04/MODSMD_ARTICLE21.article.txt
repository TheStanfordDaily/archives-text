## BYU beats volleyball twice 
### EZRA CALLAHAN STAFF WRITER 
I here were two important
lessons to be learned from the No.
5 Cardinal volleyball team's
matches against No. 2 Brigham
Young on Monday and Tuesday.
1- li st, the human bodv is a 112 rag
ile thing.
Second, BYU is really, reallv
good.
1 he Cougars (18-3, 12-3
Mountain Pacific Sports federa
tion) look advantage of a bruised
and battered Stanford squad (11-
7. 7-(>), sweeping the Cardinal in
consecutive matches in Maples
Pavilion.
Stanford played the firs!
match without one of its leading
passers, junior outside hitter
M.ire us Skacel, after he injured
his foot in practice on Sundav.
The Cardinal then had to plav
last night without redshirt
sophomore Set li Ring, who in
jured his ankle in the third game
of Monday's match.
Sophomore opposite Curt
I oppel. who missed the last three
matches with a groin strain, did
return to the lineup on Monday.
But a 15-block performance bv
the BYU net game, whit h focused
on Toppel throughout the match,
marred his return.
"BYU has always been a good
bloc king team," said head coach
Ruben Nieves. "1 hev got a lot of
those blocks against Curt, which
was a combination of two things.
First, tlie\ were gunning for him
because lie's our top hitter, and
second, this was (an t's first match
in 31 davs, so he wasn't in
top form."
The strength of the BY I.'
blocking game and the trouble it
was going to give Toppel were

very apparent earh. The Cougars
picked up six blocks, five of which
were on Toppel, in jumping out
to a lt>-12 lead in the first game.
fhe Cardinal answered with
two blocks of its own, scoring six
straight on freshman middle
blocker Billv Clayton's serve to
vault ahead of BYl", 23-21. But
the Cougar attack responded
with four consecutixe kills during
a five-point run, and the Cougars
held on to take the opening game,
30-28.
fhey are a reallv good
blocking team, and we knew
going in that they'd be all over
am slow sets." loppel said.
"They're at the top of the rank
ings fora reason."
Stanford turned to Ring in
the second game to take over the
attack, and he responded by
posting seven kills in the game.
But the Cougars' blocking con
tinued strong, and BYU
wrapped up a 30-25 win on a
service error by Ring.
Clayton served up t In ee con
secutive aces to give the Cardi
nal an early 0-4 lead in the third
game, but, after Ring's injury,
Stanford lost all of the wind in
its sails, fhe Cardinal onh
managed 12 kills in the final
game, while the Cougars hit
.580 while picking up IS kills.
BYI closed out the match with
a 30-23 win.
l oppel finished as Stanford's
leading attacker with II kills, but
the BYU block forced him to a
.103 hitting percentage for the
match. Stanford's middles, Clay
ton .Hid senior Brett Youngbcrg.
combined for 17 kills and hit a
combined .552.
Skacel. who was expected to be
out at least three weeks, surprised
everyone bv suiting up for last

night's match and tilling in at
libero. But Skacel's return was
marred b\ another all-around
strong performance In the
(lougars.
"1 was yen pleased to see how
Marcus got himself i ead\ to |>la\
Nieves said. "I thought it would
give our team more of an emo
tional boost than it did. Marcus
passed ver\ well, but we didn't get
it done in rest of the areas."
1 oppel started last night's
match strong with eight kills in
the opening game, but BYI post
ed 18 kills while hitting .455. 1 he
(lougars led most of the opening
game, which tlu \ won, HO-25.
Nieves juggled 11 is lineup m
tlie second game, replacing se
nior setter josh laikens with se
nior Brad (.liffith and putting in
sophomore Paul Bocage foi
Clayton.
I he moves did little to slow the
(lougar attack, which tallied Hi
kills while hitting at a .500 ( lip.
Eight blocks and nine digs b\
BY I helped to hold the ('at clinal
to onl\ two service points in tlie
game, which the (lougars took
easily, 110-22.
(iame tlnee was close eai l\. as
the teams tied for the lift It time in
the game at 19-19. A five-point
run bv the (lougars sealed Stan
ford s fate, and BYI closed out
the match with a 30-25 win.
BYI finished I uesda\ with 17
more bloc ks and a . IOH team hit
ting percentage, l'he (lougars
defense was equall) powerful,
fore ing Stanford to hit . 195 while
picking up 25 hitting en t us.
"It's reall\ difficult to have
shifting roles with all the in
juries," Bocage said. "We can all
plav together at the positions we
were at, but it's tough against a
team like BYI ."
