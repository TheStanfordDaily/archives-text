### LILY LIU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For some members of the Stan
ford men's swim team, there is no
off-season. While most of the swim
team left last week's NCAA Cham
pionships to wind down and relax
after the grueling collegiate sea
son. seven swimmers shitted gears
bv racing at the Phillips 00 Spring
Nationals in Austin, Texas.
Although all of the Cardinal
men's swimmers qualified for
spring nationals, only seven opted
to compete: seniors Anthony
Robinson and Steven Brown, ju
nior Michael O'Neil. sophomore
Randall Bal and freshmen
Michael Bruce, Bobby O'Bryan
and Petei Marshall.
Many of the Stanford swim
mers continued posting solid
times following the previous
week's second-place finish at the
NCAA ('.hampionship.
"NCAAs was a positive experi
ence, so that was pretty good moti
vation to keep on swimming fast."
Robinson said. "It was different
because the breaststroke wasn't
doing as well as I wanted, so I had
to switch gears and get mv breast
stroke back into focus."
I"he Cardinal senior qualified
for the world championships by
finishing second in the 100-meter
breaststroke. For Robinson, how
ever. the world championship
berth was hard-earned. He quali
fied for the finals in fourth place
after the preliminary swim. After
tving for second place with Curl-
Burke's Jarrod Man s (1 minute,
1..59 seconds), Robinson won the
third race â€” a swim-off. Bruce
finished 20th with a time of
1:04.90.
"I just wanted to make the trip
and I was pretty relaxed, thinking
that, if 1 just get into top four or
five, that should be fine, Robin
son said.

With his final time, Robinson
now finds himself as one of the top
swimmers in the world. With sm h
a strong swim in the 100 breast,
the sprinter tried his lnck in the."> 0
breast, just one lap of the pool.
Robinson succeeded once again,

berths by touching with a time of
