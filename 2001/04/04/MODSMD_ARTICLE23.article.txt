March 24.
('.omingofl its extended break,
the (Cardinal w.is a bit i ustv as the
Spartans took an earl\ lead in
the first quarter and the match
entered halltime tied at four. San

half-st <>i iug to take a.">-4 lead.
I he lead would be short-lived,
as the Cardinal responded with a
goal In freshman Brenda \ ilia
on a penalty shot, followed b\ an
othei goal b\ junior I'llen Ksies
oulv !*0 seconds latei. 1 he ( artli
nal then tacked on three unan
swered fourth-quartei goals to
take the 9-. r > victon and est ape
the slight stare.
"()ui timing was of! a bit, whit h
might have been due to the time
off during Dead Week and finals,
but I haven't sren San |ose Slate
pla\ that well all year, Villa s.iid.
" I hev were looking for an
upset and were taking great shots
tli.it happened to be going in,
which made it a tough fust half,
but we kulvctl it into geai in the
second half and were able to wear

tlu ni clou n. We kept our compo
sure .ukl kept getting ahead."
()ulv two davs later, against
No. ('Â» Hawaii, the Cardinal re
turned to its usual form as it
jumped out to an early 1-0 lead in
the first quarter.
Propelled In sophomore Julie
Gardner's four goals, the sqtiad
never looked hack, handing the
\\ ahine a 10-'l loss.
"Aftci the San |ose State game,
we pl.ived nuuh better against
Hawaii," head coach John Tan
nei said. "We not onlv stepped up
oui defense, hut shot the hall
much better than we had."
Following its two home maU li
es. Stanford went on the road to
Southern California, where it
plaved tin ee < onse< utive matches
against San Diego State. Kong
Hea( h State and I ( -Irvine.
No. 10 San Diego State provid

Stanford wasted little time, as
junior Margie Dingcldein scored
onl\ 12 seconds into the match
and had a 5-1 fiist quarter lead.
I he Cardinal would then add
seven more goals, including an
othet fbui in the final quarter of
plav. len different members of
the team scored in the match,
whi( li iii( luded three goals from
Villa.
|us! one day later, the Cardi
nal f.K ed No. 0 I .ong Heat h State
in a mi.n< li that seemed to mirror
the previous one. Stanford won
the m,itch, I (>-$, after taking a 4-0
in st quartet lead and a 0-1 lead
into the half. Similar to the San
Diego State match, I 1 different
plavcrs scored, iiu hiding leading
s( orcr I- >tes, who had three.
"1 think we were especially
successful against Long Heach
State," Villa said. "We tame out
and took it to them from the fiist
(luartcr and had a rcalb strong
counterattack.
In its final matt h of the three
game road trip, the ><|i i.ml faced
IJC-lrvine, which entered the
match I-5 in the Ml*SI-.
Unlike its previous two match
es, the (Cardinal s< ot ing (atne pi i
marily in the second half, .is the
Anteaters were onl\ two goals be

Following the break. Stanford
out scored Irvine. IM, to take the
match, 14-4.
Leading the Stanford on
slaught were Dingeldein and Villa,
who had five and three goals in the
match, respectively.
"On the southern trip, we
played three games in three da\s.

the tiivi two ot which were both
potcntialh diftu nil games, and I
thought we plavcd cspcciall\
well, I annet said. " I bis includ
ed out pla\ .it San Diego State,
where there was a bee swarm
| .iiitl| we had three plavers get
stung. Ii was |iist one of those
things that \oii have to deal with,
,iikl none ot I he people who \\ ere
allergic were stung. It was on peo
ple's minds, but it didn't seem to
be a problem.
I lie ( animal's success has
come from its consistent and
deadb oftense led bv \'ilia, who
was selected as the Vtl'SF IMaver
of the Week foi the second time
this season. In the team's five
matches, she scored nine goals,
iii( hiding three goals against both
San Diego State and l (.-Irvine.
She currently leads the team in
scoring with .">1 goals and a 2.68
goal per game average.
\ ilia and the Cardinal oftense
ted oft ot a great defense, which
held its opponents to three goals

or less in I I ol the squad's ID
matches.
"We are both a great defensive
as well as offensive team. Not only
do we have a great goalie, but out
defense dictates our opponents,
which realh helps our counterat
tack offense. Our opponents
never have time to rest, and we
are able to wear them down."
Villa said.
" lb win lopsided games, von
have to score some eas\ goals in
transition," fanner said. "A lot of
the scoring difference just has to
do with us reac ting quicker on of
fense- and creating high-c]ualit\
opportunities on counterattack
.ind our defensive stops. In partic -
ular. against 1 ong beach, we did a
particularly good job on two
meter defense."
The Cardinal hosts No. 2
UCLA on Friday .it 7:00 pan in a
match that will determine the No.
I seed entering the MI'SF champi
onship tournament at the end of
April.
