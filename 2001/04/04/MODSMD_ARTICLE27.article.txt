## Online voting to eliminate hanging chads 
### ANKUR SHAH 
In the aftermath ol last vear's electoral crisis in
Florida, many people have been searching tor a solu
tion to make the voting process more reliable. Ac
cording to the scientists and polio makers at Yote
-1 lere. a Seattle-based Internet voting pro\ iclei. online
voting is the necessan solution.

system that we've been pointing out tor years," s.iid

of data security, in which the companv owns four
patents. All of Yotel leu 's voting protocols build upon
well-known ci v ptographic sv steins, such as Public Kev
Infrastructure and the Digital Signature Standard. As
such, they have been shown to be niatheinaticallv se

without error.

brute-force let linit al attacks. I he most senile option
tor online voting remains "on-site." In this scenario,
computet terminals running Yotellere software

would be installed at typical

Yotel lere has tested this

an intent to keep capital

prices of their software at a comparable level to
other types ot balloting equipment in order to
make it feasible for poorer counties — like main of

those that had problems last November — to up
grade. To do otherwise would violate the Supreme
Court's decision on the Florida fiasco, which

deemed it unconstitutional
for some counties to suffer
higher rates of voter error
than others.

Further developments in online voting are a long
wav off. Kven Diet son admitted that YoteHere's tech
nology could not vet handle "remote" voting, where
voters could log on to the election from any Web-ac
cessible location. Remote voting introduces a host ot
difficulties associated with malicious attacks on the
voting svstem. Routers, internet sen ice providers,
computers and individual software applications are
all too susceptible to vim and hacking: the genesis of a
cryptographic nightmare.
Kven il the technology were to become available,
democratic social polio has a long wa\ to go as well.
Allowing citi/ens who have computers to vote at
home corresponds to giving them better acc ess to the
ballot box than citi/ens without computers; this vio
lates basic notions ot democracy, especially when ac
cess distinctions are split heavily along race and class
lines. Other social implications that are still poorly
understood include the ramifications of increased
voter turnout without increasing the percentage ot
informed voters and the education ot voters distrust
ful of such technology.
On March (>. the National Workshop on Internet
Voting, a non-profit organization funded by the Na
tional Science Foundation, published its report,
which found online voting to be tec hnically feasible
but socially nuclei researched. In the coming years,
answering the soc i.il questions voting technology rais
es tor our democracy — questions of voting turnout,
education and availability — will prove to be more dif
ficult than implementing the technology.
