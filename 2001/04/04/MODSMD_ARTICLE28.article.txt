# New safety measures needed to ward off cell phone dangers
## 
### ANDREW GARTH 
As new communications technology
emerges, the pace of dail\ interactions
quickens. Between Palm Pilots, wireless
Web connections and cellular phones,
we've got more personal communica
tions gadgets than we know what to do
with. There is mounting concern in the

legal world that the resulting conve
nience could lead us to slink our legal
dutv to take due care in our actions. As
strange as it ina\ seem, using a cellular
phone in a car. for example, could soine
dav lie criminal. Despite the ominousness
of such a policv, I think that might be a
wise move.
A recent criminal case in Maryland in
volved the first known prosecution for ve
hicular homicide resulting from cellular
phone use. 1 hat is, the driver was thought
to have been acting reasonably — except
that he was on his cellular phone. The de
fendant, a Naval Academy midshipman,
was tried for vehicular homic ide after hit
ting two people while dialing bis cellular
phone. Both of the victims died.
In a recent South Carolina case, a
teenage girl lost control of her car while
talking on her phone and ran into a
woman earning her two-year-old child.
I he c liild died two clays later.
Almost all of us have anecdotal evi
dence of the hazards of driving with a cel
lular phone. Yet for main people it is gen
eralh considered normal and acceptable

behavior. But is it because weconsidei cel
lular phone use to be sate, or in it because
we simpl\ haven't grasped the implica
tions ot this new and wondertiilh conve
nient tecluiolog\ ?
1 he midshipman from Marvland was
acquitted because, in short, i .11 phone use
is not legalh considered to be unreason
able behavior. Like California, Maryland
requires a finding ot a conscious disregard
ot a substantial and unjustifiable risk be
fore convicting a defendant of vehicular
homicide. I he South Carolina teenager
was made to attend boot camp tor 90 da\ s
and lost her lit ense until she turns 21.
Rather than arguing that eithet of them
should have gone to jail. 1 think we should
consider the reasons why tliev were not
legalh liable. 1 hev were found not guiltv
because thev had not been put on notice
that driving while using a cellular phone
can be extremeK dangerous.
While some tvpes of use are more
dangerous than others, evidence shows
that it is not the physical component ot
driving with a cellular phone that is the
most dangerous; it is the uucannv abilitv

of cellular phones to distract us. It is .is
though we are concentrating so hard on
( ommuiiic ating without seeing the other
person that we forget what c ars are. Cars
are, legallv speaking, "inherently dan
gerous instruments."
Are cellulai phones materially differ
ent from car radios, drive-thru coffee
and c on\ cm Nations with passengers? Data
suggest that cellular phones are closer in
effect to drunk driving than driving
while roc king out to your favorite Led
Zeppelin tune.
I here arc currently 110 million cellular
phone users in the I'nited States, and
there will be 200 million l>\ 2010. A study
In the New Lngland Journal of Medicine
suggests that cat phone users are three to
foui times more likely to have accidents
than drivers without phones. Another
study, released last month by the I 'niver
sit\ of Montreal's transportation Safety
Laboratory, concluded that cellular
phone users had a W percent higher risk
of ac c ident and that the risk increased with
frequency of use.
flic Montreal study involved 'W.OOO

subjects. ()ue male out of three aiul one fe
male out of two said that cellular-phone
use significanth interfered with their dri
ving. ()iiK percent said that the radio or
t. with passengers presented a com
parable risk.
Some how, though, we aren't aware of
the danger.
I became aware last week when 1 near
ly drifted into another car at 7f> mph while
Irving to locate my ringing cellular phone.
It's common sense, right? But maybe we
should pause fora moment to consider the
heightened responsibility that comes with
wielding new and little understood tech
nologies — even those as basic as personal
communications devices.
Who. if anyone, should raise the aware
ness of the public about new levels of c are
required bv emerging technologies?
Should ii be the courts? Judges and juries
have neither the expertise nor the fact
finding capabilities t<> adequately explore
the societal implications of emerging tech
nologies. Indeed, today's traffic laws and
