# Scientist makes E.coli discovery

In the March issue of Science, C hemical
Engineering Prof. C.haitan Khosla an
nounced that his lab had recentlv achieved
its 10-year goal of producing the antibiotic
erythromycin from K. coli, the bacteria that
inhabits the human digestive tract.
This powerful antibiotic is produced nat
urally by the soil bacteria S. Ervthraea, but
S. Ervthraea populations grow slowlv, dou
bling only everv four hours. In contrast, E.
coli can double its numbers in I JO minutes,
meaning th.it Khosla's breakthrough mav
serve as a more practical and efficient
means of manufacturing new life-saving
drugs.
In terms of practical use. E. coli is the pre
ferred recipient in experiments where genes
from one species are inserted into another, E.
coli is particulatK useful because it has been
extensively studied and is easy to modify.
Stanford has a histon of profiting from
biotechnology. I ( '.-Berkeley s Iferbert Hover
and Stanford's Stanlcv ('.ohen practicalh found
ed biotechnology .is a ifield when they disc overed
recombinant I)NA (inserting genes from one or
ganism into another) in the 1070 s. I he tet li
ni(|ue brought Stanford over $100 million in
royalties alone — the highest earning patent in
the University's historv.
"Because E. coli grows at a rapid pace,
we're able to ask research questions much
quicker with this system, said Blaine
Pfeifer, a graduate student in chemical engi

neering .ind the primary experimenter on
111i n project.
For the breakthrough, Pfeifer deleted foui of
the native genes from the I)NA of E. coli and in
troduced in their place six foreign genes from the
ervtliioinw in-producing bacteria. Many of these
gene inserts were over 10.000 DNA l).isc pairs
each — making them the largest ever tolx* insert
ed into E. coli.
" The big challenge was finding a way to
equip E. coli with correct cellular machinery
needed to make a natural product," Pfeifer
said. "And even if we could do Iliis. we had to
make sure the new machinery would func
tion correctly in a completely different cellu
lar environment.''
E. coli produced erythromycin "precur
sors," or intermediaries, identical to S. Ery
thraea. These precursors were then modified
to yield the actual antibiotic.
In addition to Pfeifer, Suzanne Admiraal, a
postdoctoral fellow, helped in the experimen
tal procedure. Hugo (>ramajo, of Facultad de
(liencias Bioquiniicas v Farmaceuticas in Ar
gentina (School of Bi<x hemical and Pharma
ceutical Sciences), provided a substance to
make a kev cellular substrate, and David ('ranc
of Brown University, served as an additional
adviser.
I lie researchers are now optimizing the sys
tem and verifying its feasibility on large st ale, as
the commercial application of producing antibi
otics cheaply is counted in billions of dollars.
This E.coli project was supported with grants
from the National Institutes of Health and the
National Science Foundation.
