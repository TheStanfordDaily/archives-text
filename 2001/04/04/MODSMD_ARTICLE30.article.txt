# Stanford shines at Smithsonian
## 
### NINA CANN-WOODE STAFF WRITER 
I lie Smithsonian's Lemelson
Center presented its fifth annual
"March Madness for the Mind, a
free, one-dav exhibit spotlighting the
most innovative creations of student
scientists, engineers and entrepre
neurs from across the nation. I lie
work of three teams of Stanford stu
dents sponsored by the National ( ol
legiate Inventors and Innovation Al
liance was featured at the March 7
exhibit.
"|ust as the best college basketball
plavers gather at the Final Four in
March, the best college inventors
gather at the Smithsonian," said I'hil
Weilerstein, program manager of
tlu- alliance. "Kacli student-inventor
is turning a good idea into a mar
ketable product or innovation —
while still in school. We are very
proud of their work."
One of inventions featured .it the
exhibit was the ( tie ('.aid Emergency
Medical Aid, acredt card-sized device
that guides the user through emer
gency medical protmols such as (.PR.
used on drowning victims, for in
stance. A pre-recorded voice asks the
user a series of questions — "Is the
person breathing?" and soon —and

dictates the next host course of action
based on the responses to these ques
tions. Red and green buttons provide
the means ol interaction and feed-
Inn k between device and user.
"IK the end of a CPR class, .1 lot of
people are excited by the fact that
they know what to do when an emer
gency happens," said Dr. Rolf Faste,
a mechanical engineering professor
and facultv advisor to the Stanford
team projects. "But when something
reallv does happen, they can forget
what they learned. The Cue Card
will be useful in this way because it
guides people through the basic
steps of doing CPR — even it they've
forgotten how. And you can just pull
ii right out of your wallet like a cred
it card."
Product design graduate stu
dents Neil Crimmer and Robert
(iarrett first began work on the ('.ue
Card Kmergencv Medical Aid while
in Dr. Faste's "need-finding'" c lass,
the master's thesis c lass for product
design majors. Students in this class
rode in ambulances, attended first
aid (lasses and rode in ( oast Cuard
helicopters to gather ideas for
products that would satisfy appar
ent needs.
Hie IMPACT Indicator was an
other project featured at the Smith

sonian exhibit. Mike Strasser, a grad
uate student in product design,
began work on the project when he
realized that a shoe's viability de
pends on iniu li more than how long
it has been used.
According to Dr. Faste, there is
currently no effective way to deter
mine when to replace athletic shoes
on the market. 1 lie device, enabled
by PACT, a microprocessor-based
technology, is designed to lit inside
shoes at the heel and toe to determine
when adequate cushioning has worn
out and should be replaced. It comes
at a low cost, is lightweight and
equipped with a lithium batten with
a life of five or more years.
According to the project's Web
site, running shoes should Ix- re
placed even' 1150-500 miles, but shoe
wear varies due to an athlete's weight
and si/e, his or her foot's impact pro
file and the type of running terrain.
"Many common athletic injuries
are due to deterioration in the c ush
ioning provided by the mid-sole of
the shoe — a compressible, shock ab
sorbing, protective material," ex
plained the project Web site. "When
this material loses its rebounding
qualitv, it can cause serious injuries
such as shin splints, heel spurs and
stress fractures."
