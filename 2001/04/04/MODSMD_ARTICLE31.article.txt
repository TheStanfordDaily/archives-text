WASHINGTON (A I') — Washington For
near l\ .i reniur\, tl prints have been super

What is going on? I'lie Supreme ('.ourt ret entl\
raised the hat loi st ieu ti fie evidence, and t lit its s.i\

I-iiigerpt itit evidence is based on the idea that
no two people have the same lingerpi int. but how

For one thing, it seemed to provitle certainty in

Hut in IOO.'L a Supreme (ourt decision ie
t|iiiretl jutlges to take a inoie active role in decid
ing what scientific evidence to admit. In the t ase ol
fingerprints, the so-called "Daubert" guidelines
would le.it I to tjt lest ions sim Ii as: I las i lit- prat t it eol
fingerprint identification been atlet|iiatel\ tested?
What's iht' errot rate? .Are there standards and
ct >i 11 rols?
I ntlei these criteria, tiuns s.iv, fingerprint
identification toultl be challenged on the
grounds that it has not been atletjuateb testetl,
that the ei ioi i ate has not been t alt iilat etl. a lit I
that there are ii<> standards loi what constitutes
a matt h.
loi example, tiitus s.t\ it's not cle.u how
mall\ matt lung points t >l t onipat ison, like a
ridge splitting into two oi the contours of intli
vitlual litlges, are sufficient I«»i an examiner 11>
make an itlentilit at ion.

flie Daubert guidelines ct>ver federal courts,
and other courts in half of the states have decitletl
tt> follow that approach. So am ruling against fin
gerprint evidence could allect courts across the
countrv.
Ihe first challenge t<> fingerprint evidence
under the Daubert guidelines was played out at a
federal court heal ing in |nl\ 1099 in Philadelphia,
before the trial of a man accused to driving a get
awa\ car m a lobherv.
I he prosecution saitl the man's prints were on
the gearshift antl door of the car. In the end, the
judge allowed the fingerprint evident e in the trial,
antl the man wast onvicted.
\t least 10 otliei such challenges have been
filed since, but none has vet kept fingei pi ints out
ola trial.
I hat shows judges have recognized fingerprint
evident e as meeting Daubert t riteria, saitl Stephen
Meagher, unit chic! lor latent print work at the
Federal bureau of Investigation laboratorv.
" I lie fingerprint discipline has 100 vears ol
liistoi \," Meaghci saitl. " I here is extensive dot -
n mentation to the st ien ti fit basis, w hit Ii has been
published, peer-reviewed antl t hallengcd mam
times .... Ii has withstood those t hallenges.
\ \far ago. in an announcement seizetl on b\
t ntu sol lingerpi in ting, the | list it e Department's
National Institute of |usiite said it was reatlv to
spend $.">OO,OOO for studies ol the tlist ipiine.
It said the field needed more evidence lot the

needed standaitli/cd analvsis protedures that are
showu it) woi k with at teptable error i ales.
Last |line, however, the institute issued a clari
fication, declaring that it has no reason to doubt
ili.it fingerprints are ihiitpie. It saitl the announce
ment sought studies t)111\ "to further confirm the
.ilte.itl\ existing basis that permits fingerprints to
be used lot it lei 11 i fit ation.
( iting "the si it t ess of current procedures." the
institute said fingerprint aual\ sis should still he pe

I lie institute is now looking ovei f«>111 proposals
to tit) the researt h. antl it's not \et t leai w bethei it
will accept an\ ol them, instiinte spokesman Doug
|ohnson saitl.
So what happens now with fingerprint e\i
tlente? Shoultl it continue to be admitted into
t 0111 t ?
"I think miii tan make good arguments on both
sides ol that one," Mnookin saitl. but if it's admit
