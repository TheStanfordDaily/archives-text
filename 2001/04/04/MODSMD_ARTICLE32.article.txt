# Bunny World challenges coders

### VIC REKLAITIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
li s Frida\ night on the Farm .11 the end of the
(|iiarter, and there are more students tapping
awav at keyboards in Sweet Hall than tapping
at campus parties. Many ol those in Sweet
ILi 11 are working on the infamous programming
project known as BunnvWorld. Binim World is
the final project f<>i (lompnter Science I<>S: "()b
-jected Oriented Programming." I he goal of the
project is to implement an editor fora simple
graphical adventure game using the |ava pro
gramming language.
Wander among the I NIX workstations and it"s
(leai that there ai e some common complaints al)out
BunnvWorld. "It's taken all ol niv time for the last
two and .1 half weeks," one unshaven computet sci
ence major s.tid. "All this work just so I can pla\ a
game tilled with bunnies and < ai rots!-" asked anoth
ei. "Sweet 1 lall is < rowded and depressing" is a fre
c|iient comment. ()thcr students are frustrated with
their ptojec 1 group members.

going through real problems — struggling with
tliein and then solving them. And then repeating.
( S 108 has been < he >sen as the com sc that gives \ou
that. I hose who survive the crucible of Bunnv-
World are supremeb confident in then program
ming abilities.
Although making .1 game editor might seem
( hildish. Pal lante points out ili.it "it's understood in
the education communit\ that people enjov msii.il
projects." \i the same time. BunnvWorld requires
deep, logical programming skills. Students must
le.llll about manv of Java's features 011 their own
.iiid ilien tie them into their project. "The word I
like to use is 'orchestrate.'" I'arlante said of the
process.
W hen asked about Sweet Hall's distinctive op
pressive atmosphere, I'arlantc's eves seem to focus
off into the distance and he begins to reminisce.
"When I w.is doing this in it was |ust ilie
same," I'arlante said. "You would go to the (luster,
and 11 would be you and vour team at two 111 the
11101 niiii' and \ou would have c 1 innim hot ( hoc o
late. M\ inemoiA of it is partialb miserable, but I
also kind of enjoved it. There was some bonding
there." ()ne computet s( ietue major who took the
< l.iss, sophomore |orge Reves, agreed. "It's very
stressful but it's great," Reves s.iid.

Sweet Hall Consulting Coordinator Dwayne
Yiin.in has another perspective on the grungy,
diml\ lit and often crowded computet cluster.
" I his place can he completely different at night
(lining Dead Week. I'eople have projects due.
I lic\ like to pull chait s around and work in groups
and have pi//.i delivered and ice cream and music
hl.u nig. I here are not a lot of labs whet e vou can do
that sort of tiling. You can't bring food into the li
brary. 1 here's a trade-off. We could put in all new
furniture and chandeliers, but then vou couldn t
have snack food at your workstation and we
(oulcln't be open 2 I hours.
"We are trying to get more chairs and new car
peting. " \ ii nan said, bin there are no othei major
plans for improvement or expansion of Sweet
Hall. At the beginning of the academic year, new
I \l\ computers were placed in the Meyer Li
brary 2-1-hour Study Room, but, according to \ ir
nau, there is currenth no space for another row of
workstations.
Nonetheless, Yirnau is confident that the over
(rowding problem will be solved. " 1 here is always
one limiting resource." he said, It used to be net
woi k bandwidth. ()ne assignment called Ma/.eW ars
foi one c lass took out the entire c luster.' Because of
a better network arrangement, that does not bap
pen am more. "Improvements are made all the time
that students don't notice," Yirnau said.
l-or mam ofCS I OS's budding computer scien
tists, working with a team is often the most chal
lenging part of BunnvWorld. Over the years, l\n
lante lias found that "there are a couple teams each
(|u.u ter that are not especially happv."
For Reyes, the team programming experience is
invaluable. "Working in a group poses a lot of chal
lenges that you wouldn't get through writing a
papei or doing an individual project. It helps me a
lot." he said. He sees the occasional difficulties he
had with bis team in a positive light. "I learned a lot
about working with people, and it will impact how I
c hoose mv project groups in the future.''
I he Bunm World project is in many ways a trial
In fire. Sweet Hall can be as intense and unpleasant
as a furnace — just ask anyone there whose brain is
fried from a 10-hour stint of programming. How
ever. as (ore features of the program become func
tional. extensions are added and, finally, I Kino I )av
comes, many CS IDS students s.iv they have be
come treniendoush satisfied with the experience.
As tliev laugh at the antics of the K.vil Bunny of
Death, show off extra whi/-bang features to their
teaching assistant and exchange ideas for one last
time with their team, some might even get a little
niistv-eycd. "Oh, Bunny World," tliev might say.
"you hurt so good."
