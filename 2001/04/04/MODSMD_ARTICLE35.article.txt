Students have expressed interest in tbe
possibilit\ of being able to ac c ess die Intel net
from ofl campus. 1 )aniela len i pest a.a junior,
said, I would definiteh subscribe it enough
businesses provided tbe option [of connect
ing], since I love to bring ill\ laptop to c ales.
I was foriimate enough to have the chance

to test out AirWave loi imself. Setup of the
network card was fast and eas\ — I popped
the card into the slot under m\ standard edi
ct net c aid and installed the appropi iate dri
\ei s from the etu losed (. 1). Configuration of
the service itself took less than five minutes of
following simple directions, and I was on niv
wav. I'm not pat lie iil.u l\ computet sa\ \ \ ni \ -
sell, and I found that getting the svsiein up
and running was cjintc doable for those who
prefer not to spend time tinkering with set
tings and hardware.

is in the same range .is that ot the Stanford net

speeds equivalent to Dsl lines. I sing the hand

somewhat limited, the coinpam is expanding

I plan on continuing to use Air Wave. I'd
like to see it expand across campus to the
point where I could even use it outdoors.
Sophomore ( In is Landauei suggested that
"the p.ii tnei ship with AirWave will allow staff
.iikl students to I>i itithe convenience of a I'-
ll connei tion out into the open air."
I ransniilters can send .i signal up to HOO

less connected campus. Because students

ibis could encourage more people to leave

As Landauei said, "Wireless netwoi k con
