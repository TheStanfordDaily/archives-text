Previously unseen details of a mvsterious, complex structure within the Carina Nebula (NGC 3372) are revealed by this image of the "Keyhole Nebu
la," obtained with NASA s Hubble Space Telescope. The picture is dominated by a large, approximately circular feature, which is part of the Keyhole
Nebula, named in the 19th century by Sir John Herschel. This region, about 8000 light-years from Eartri, is located adjacent to the famous explosive
variable star Eta Carinae, which lies just outside the field of view toward the upper right. The Carina Nebula also contains several other stars that are
among the hottest and most massive known, each about 10 times as hot, and 100 times as massive, as our Sun.(Courtesy of NASA and the Hubble Her
