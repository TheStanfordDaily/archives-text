# Smoking possibly linked to female bladder cancer

### 
WASHINGTON (AIM
W omen smokers mav facc a high
er ri>k of bladder cant er lhan men
who smoke the same amount, a
new stuck suggests. Some cancer
experts, however, are skeptical
about the findings.
Scientists have long warned that
American smokers are two to three
times more likeh to get bladder
i ancer than nonsmokers are.
I niversitv of Southern (lalifor
nia researchers had begun com
paring bladder cancel tales be
tween smokers in different parts
of the world when thev spotted
something unusual: in their studv,
the American women who
smoked seemed at higher risk
than men.
"I'll be the first to admit it is
counterintuitive," said studv co
author Ronald Ross, chairman of
preventive medicine at the ISC
Norris Comprehensive Cancer
Center. Overall, bladder cancer
strikes far more men than women.
Ross' research team then com
pared the smoking habits of I ,f> 14
I.os Angeles-area bladder cancel
patients with 1.514 similar but can
cer-tree people.
Cigarette smokers were 2.5
times more likelv than nonsmok
ers to have been stricken with blad
der cancer, the team reported ves
terday in the Journal of the Na
tional Cancer Institute. Risk in
creased with length of time smok
ing and number of dailv cigarettes;
filtered or low-tar cigarettes
weren't safer.
For almost every amount of
cigarettes smoked, women's risk
was a little higher than men's — a
statistically significant increase,
Ross said. For the heaviest smok
ers — 40 cigarettes a day for 40
years _ women's risk was twice
that of men's.
But Ross wasn't convinc ed until
he analyzed blood tests performed
on 1,300 study participants. The
bodies of women smokers bar

bored move metabolites ol tobac
co-carried chemicals tailed arv
lamines, believed to spur snioking
caused bladder c.nicer, (lie stud\
found.
"It suggests that women some
how either activate or detoxifx
these (chemicals) dittercntlx than
men do," Ross said. Ihe (|uestion
for us now is: Whv does that
occur?"
American Cancel Society epi
demiologist Michael I bun urged
caution, because in general blad
der t am er occurs tour times more
frequent Ix in men than women.
While smoking isn't bladder
cancer's onl\ cause, men's higher
disease rate "makes it implausible
that smoking poses a greater risk
in women," I linn said.
Also, this tvpe of stud\. known
scientifically as a "case-control,"
can overestimate women's risk,
riiun said.
" I'lie main point is how high
the risk is for long-term smok
ers" regardless ol gender, he
stressed.
But Ross said other studies
suggest women smokers max face
a higher risk of lung (amei than
male smokers, so gender differ
ences in bladdet earner, too,
make sense.
I he I SC. researchers also are
investigating smokers in China,
who get lung cant er |iist .is readily
as American smokers but seem to
have a loxver bladder cant er risk.
Add that quaiularx tothel .S. gen
der finding and "there's really
something fundamental about the
smoking-hladdct cancer relation
ship that we rcallx don't under
stand," Ross contended.
About 54,300 Amei it ans will be
diagnosed with bladder cancer this
year, and 12,100 will die, the tau
ter sot ictx estimates. Coxernmcnt
statistics show smoking kills over
100,000 Americans a vear, from
numerous cant ers, heart diseases
ami lung diseases.
