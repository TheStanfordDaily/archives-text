### 
BEIJING (AP) — As China
pressed its demand that the
United States apologize fora
collision between a U.S. spy
plane and a Chinese tighter jet,
China's foreign minister said
yesterday that Beijing wants a
dignified resolution "as soon as
possible.''
President Jiang Zemin called
for an apologv, as did Foreign
Minister lang Jiaxuan in a
meeting with the U.S. ambas
sador. American diplomats,
meanwhile, sought a second
chance to see crew of the Navv
EP-3E, which made an emer
gency landing on a Chinese is
land after the collision.
The White House ruled
out any apology, and Presi
dent Bush has said China
must return the plane and its
crew or else relations could be
damaged.
But in an apparent attempt
to soothe Chinese feelings, Sec
retary of State Colin Powell ex
pressed regret yesterday over
the loss of the Chinese pilot,
who parachuted out of his fight
er over the South China Sea and
was presumed dead.
"We regret the loss of life of
that Chinese pilot, but now we
need to move on," Powell told
reporters in Washington. "We
need to bring this to a resolu
tion and we're using every av
enue available to us to talk to
the Chinese side to exchange

explanations.''
Powell's statement came after
lang — after reiterating the
demand for .111 apology — gave
the first sign of (Ihinesc desire to
end the mounting tension in his
meeting with Ambassador
Joseph Prueher.
Beijing "pays attention to
Chma-l .S. relations and hopes
to see the collision incident re
solved appropriateh .is soon as
possible,'' I ang s.iid. according
to st.ite media. He added th.it
China wanted to protect its
"sovereignty and dignity," but
did not elaborate.
Earlier, Jiang demanded an
apologv, adding that the I nited
States should "do something fa
vorable"' to smooth China-l'.S.
ties, state media reported. He
then left on .1 six-nation trip to
Lit in America.
A former I S. ambassador to
Beijing, Winston Lord, said
|iang's departure isn't a sign
that he didn't take the standoff
scriouslv. Cancelling the trip
"would have made it an incred
ible crisis," Lord said, and Jiang
can still handle the situation
from abroad.
Zhang Hongxi, China s con
sul general in New York,
wouldn't comment directly
about Powell's expression of re
gret. But he insisted the U.S.
plane was to blame for the crash,
and said he personally favored
U.S. payment of compensation.
