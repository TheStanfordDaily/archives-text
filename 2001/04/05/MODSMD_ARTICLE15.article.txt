# Law students upset over parking
## 
### MARK DOMINIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
I niversitx officials are strengthening
enforcement o! regulations at a p.irking
lot adjoining law students' dormitories
in response to threats ol litigation l>\ res
idents who claim the I niversitv's cur
rent failure to ensure adequate parking
constitutes contract fraud.
"Parking problems have worsened
near ('.rothers and ('rothers Memorial
iu the last week, and I am now receiving
similar complaints about displaced
pai king near I m ondido \ illage as a i e
sult ol construction." states a March 20
memo from I \ C.levenger, a third-vear
law student and representative-at-large
ol the Graduate Student Council, to
Stanford General C.ounsel Debra
Zutnwalt.
At the beyrinninu of the academic

\ear. the lot was changed from "inner
east" to "east " parking, according to ( le
venger. As a result, students began to
use- the lot — the parking area closest to
the library — as a commuter lot. C.onse
quentlv, ('.rothers residents were forced
to park several blocks from their dot tni
torv, instead of in their own lot.
"One of the arguments of the admin
istration is that it is not that fat to walk
a couple of blocks to park. If we knew
that, when we moved in, that's one
thing, but now we can't park in our lot,"
('.le\rnger said.
W hat iinalh prompted law students
to threaten litigation was an alleged
double standard in the Stanford Depart
ment of Public Safetv.
"A few communiu service officers
decided thev were not going to enforce
the parking regulations against people
who were using this lot as a commuter

lot." Clevenger said. "They weren't
ti< keting them. II one <>t us was forced
to park .it tlie end <>t the row, we were
ticketed."
Law students s.iv that it is unfair to
punish them when thev are forced to
break parking regulations because ot
the illegally parked vehicles ot other
students.
"They start punishing us and don't
punish those who are tilling up our lot.
Chat's when we told the I niversit\ that,
il thev don't do something, we're going
to sue them," C'.levenger said.
However, acting Director of Public
Safety Marvin Moore contends that no
double standard exists.
"We don't have a dual
standard. . .We're consistent with en
forcement." Moore said. "Not enforcing
