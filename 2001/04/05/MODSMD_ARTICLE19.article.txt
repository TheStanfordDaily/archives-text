Our disillusionment about indepen
dence might be due, in part, to the last
pared quarter svstein. I lie quarter is
over so quickU that it forces us to beiome
completely submerged in Stanford life
and drowns us in the present. I his sub
mersion into Stanford culture can have
positive and negative effects. Living awa\
from home, in a sometimes uncomfort
able environment, can strengthen the
soul, forcing us to figure out who we arc
and what we want outside the context of
a pressured home-life.
But oftentimes, iu me at least, living
away from home fosters some unwar
ranted elitist tendencies. "I, Arisha

seem to be constructed ol halves — the

halt craving stability, the halt tearing iso

to a truh independent being.
Stanford exists as a significant step on
the road It> independence, but it is in no
wax the leap main ot its incoming fresh
men have hoped tor. It exists, however,
somewhere between past and future in
the whole realm of change. It doesn't
allow us it> be entirely independent, but
somehow it otters us .t long enough leash
to walk our "own" paths. And 1 think
that's enough for me right now .
