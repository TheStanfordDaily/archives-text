tli.it the (iraduate Student (Council
was well-established and knew the
best agenda to pursue for graduate
student issues, and that the ASSI
would support that agenda.
Karton and Kstrada want to ex

and dorm at least once per vcar
and connecting students to their
(lass councils, l liev added that
campus organizations should not
have to struggle for funding.
On the question of long- and
short-term goals, the need fora new
student union was a frequent topic,
but candidates disagreed on the
form of immediate, material change.
Brewer and ('.ordero said they
believed that the ASSI had already
made significant short-term
changes to campus life, such as
Stanford After Midnight, and that,
Ijet ause of experience in the ASSI ,
thc\ know the quickest and most ef
ficient channels to short term re
form. I hc\ emphasized a balance
between short- and long-term
goals, adding that the a new student
union is. according to the adminis

Barton and Kstrada said that,
no matter what happens, thev
want to "at least provide tangible
results," such as heating lamps
outside the (10l 10. later hours for
libraries and a more sot ial ASM .
Wolfe and Shankar believe a
new student union is a fundamen

provements. such as a student
card offering discounts at a wide
variety of local 112 ranchises and later
Marguerite hours.
Attendees praised the candi

would support that agenda.

campus organizations should not

On the question of long- and
short-term goals, the need fora new
student union was a frequent topic,
but candidates disagreed on the
form of immediate, material change.
Brewer and ('.ordero said they
believed that the ASSI had already

Barton and Kstrada said that,
no matter what happens, thev
want to "at least provide tangible
results," such as heating lamps
outside the (10l 10. later hours for
libraries and a more sot ial ASM .
Wolfe and Shankar believe a
new student union is a fundamen

provements. such as a student
card offering discounts at a wide
variety of local 112 ranchises and later
Marguerite hours.
Attendees praised the candi
dates and issues discussed in the
debate, but found the setup to be
less than perfect.
"The debate was well-orga

said Manama Whitc-f fammond. a
Urewcr-(.ordcro supporter. "It
was advertised at the last minute, it
should have been televised on the
