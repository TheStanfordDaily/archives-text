Faculty and students question
Nike contract
We have learned that Stanford is on
the verge ol renewing its contract be
tween the Department of Athletics and
Nike, which involves student-athletes
advertising lor the Nike corporation as
part of their participation in Stanford
sponsored activities. \\x wearing jersevs,
shorts, sweats and caps that directly asso
ciate Stanford's name with the Nike cor
poration. the students are partv to the
I niversitv's decision to promote Nike
products.
We. the undersigned members of the
Stanford community, suspect that such .1
contract threatens principles and pro
prieties that the I nivcisitv should (and
indeed claims to) uphold. I he impend
ing Nike contract raises the following
questions:
As <1 non-profit organization, should
Stanford contractually agree to adver
tise for .1 for-profit corporation, with
Stanford students as the beat ers of that
advertising ?
If Stanford chooses to advertise for
such corporations, what criteria does it
use to screen those it decides to repre
sent? Are there any corporations for
which Stanford would not advertise?
Nike, for example, has .1 well-docu
mented record of human rights abuses
in the past. These include the employ
ment of child labor, the use of toxic ele
ments in shoe manufacture, the ex

ploitation of I bird World workers (all
conveniently subcontracted), inade
quate wages, sexual harassment (most
of the sewers, stitchers and gluers are
Noting women), forced overtime, physi
cal abuse and firing union organizers.
Docs th.it matter?
If Stanford contracts with Nike, what
spec ific measures is the I niversitv taking
to ensure that Nike operates in .1 fashion
consistent with the values of the I niver
sitv? Scores of universities with athletic
apparel contracts (most recently Notre
Dame) have joined the Workers' Rights
Consortium, which tries to monitor
working conditions. Whv hasn't Stan
ford done the same?
If the contract contains an "opt-out"
clause for student athletes, what mea
sures is the UnivcrsitN taking to ensure
there is no Athletics Department pres
sure against a student's exercising that
option? 1 lie Athletics Department is a
direct benefit iarv of Nike "largesse"
(purportedly, the contract is worth $2
million per vcar, with $10,000 paid
back from Stanford to Nike for each
Stanford athlete who "opts out"). If this
is indeed the arrangement, then the
Athletics Department lacks incentives
to publicize the opt-out clause or pro
vide the kind of self-critical environ
ment to make it viable.
What educational programs do the
Athletics Department and the University
propose to make the opt-out option
meaningful? If the institution contracts

ii* students to advertise lor Nike, then n
is responsible for laving out tullv the na
ture ol students' commitment, the choic
es before them and the reasons thc\
might w ish not to advertise tor Nike.
II Stanford, as an institution, tries to
retrain from taking moral and ethical
stands on issues where reasonable peo
ple disagree, then how does it justih
m.iking a contractual arrangement to
advertise Nike products, given that
members ol the Stanford commuuit\
have expressed public l\ that the institu
tion should not take such .1 pro-corpo
rate, pro-Nike stand, particularly on the
bodies ol its students?
We look forward to .1 response to
these questions and to open debate in
various I nivcrsitv forums on these is
sues before any contract with Nike is
signed.
