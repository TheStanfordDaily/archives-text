Faculty and students question
Nike contract
We have learned that Stanford is on
the verge ol renewing its contract be
tween the Department of Athletics and
Nike, which involves student-athletes
advertising lor the Nike corporation as
part of their participation in Stanford
sponsored activities. \\x wearing jersevs,
shorts, sweats and caps that directly asso
ciate Stanford's name with the Nike cor
poration. the students are partv to the
I niversitv's decision to promote Nike
products.
We. the undersigned members of the
Stanford community, suspect that such .1
contract threatens principles and pro
prieties that the I nivcisitv should (and
indeed claims to) uphold. I he impend
ing Nike contract raises the following
questions:
As <1 non-profit organization, should
Stanford contractually agree to adver
tise for .1 for-profit corporation, with
Stanford students as the beat ers of that
advertising ?
If Stanford chooses to advertise for
such corporations, what criteria does it
use to screen those it decides to repre
sent? Are there any corporations for
which Stanford would not advertise?
Nike, for example, has .1 well-docu
mented record of human rights abuses
in the past. These include the employ
ment of child labor, the use of toxic ele
ments in shoe manufacture, the ex

ploitation of I bird World workers (all
conveniently subcontracted), inade
quate wages, sexual harassment (most
of the sewers, stitchers and gluers are
Noting women), forced overtime, physi
cal abuse and firing union organizers.
Docs th.it matter?
If Stanford contracts with Nike, what
spec ific measures is the I niversitv taking
to ensure that Nike operates in .1 fashion
consistent with the values of the I niver
sitv? Scores of universities with athletic
apparel contracts (most recently Notre
Dame) have joined the Workers' Rights
Consortium, which tries to monitor
working conditions. Whv hasn't Stan
ford done the same?
If the contract contains an "opt-out"
clause for student athletes, what mea
sures is the UnivcrsitN taking to ensure
there is no Athletics Department pres
sure against a student's exercising that
option? 1 lie Athletics Department is a
direct benefit iarv of Nike "largesse"
(purportedly, the contract is worth $2
million per vcar, with $10,000 paid
back from Stanford to Nike for each
Stanford athlete who "opts out"). If this
is indeed the arrangement, then the
Athletics Department lacks incentives
to publicize the opt-out clause or pro
vide the kind of self-critical environ
ment to make it viable.
What educational programs do the
Athletics Department and the University
propose to make the opt-out option
meaningful? If the institution contracts

ii* students to advertise lor Nike, then n
is responsible for laving out tullv the na
ture ol students' commitment, the choic
es before them and the reasons thc\
might w ish not to advertise tor Nike.
II Stanford, as an institution, tries to
retrain from taking moral and ethical
stands on issues where reasonable peo
ple disagree, then how does it justih
m.iking a contractual arrangement to
advertise Nike products, given that
members ol the Stanford commuuit\
have expressed public l\ that the institu
tion should not take such .1 pro-corpo
rate, pro-Nike stand, particularly on the
bodies ol its students?
We look forward to .1 response to
these questions and to open debate in
various I nivcrsitv forums on these is
sues before any contract with Nike is
signed.

Provost responds to Nike letter
I niversity President John Hennessy and
I understand the divergent views ot tat ult\.
students and stall on the Nike matter, and
we appreciate the reasonable manner in
which the concerns have been expressed.
While negotiations are confidential,
we do feel it is important to note that the
information regarding a cont rat i includ
ed in the open letter is not accurate.
C )ur one and only interest in negotiat
ing with Nike is to support our student
athletes. Without equipment contracts
1 ike this, the Department of Athletics
would not be able to pro\ itle main ot our
student-athletes with uniforms and
equipment. We would be fated with
three options: require students to bu\
their own equipment, eliminate some
teams or subsidize the intercollegiate
athletic program with general I nivei sii\
funds — something we have never done
before.
As an institution and as individuals,
we are concerned about the working
conditions at companies with whom we
have a relationship, and we expet I them

to complv with the law in this regard.
Nonetheless, we deal with too main out
side contractors to take on the responsi
bilitv for monitoring those working con
ditions in a meaningful wav. Nike as
cribes to the Collegiate Licensing Com
panv Code ot Conduct and the Fair
I .abor Association (.ode of Conduct and
employs far more people in its monitor
ing operation than any comparable com
pan\. I liven the options, we feel this is a
respectable solution.
Still, we recognize that there may Ik*
some student-athletes who would rather
not wear corporate logos. A simple pro
cess is being put in place to ensure that
these students may opt out of wearing
the logo. I will be the final arbiter ot am
such case, and I can sav that 1 would nat
urally tend to support an athlete's re
quest to "opt out. I best* are tough is
sues, and I want to reiterate nn respect
for those w hose views differ from mine.

Hennessy addresses recent racist graffiti
Our community has recently suf
fered a series ot incidents involving of
fensive racist graffiti and vandalism. 1
want to make it clear that the I niversity
will not tolerate actions such as these.
We will vigorously pursue efforts to
identify the person or people w ho t otn
mittcd these acts, and the full forte of
Stanford's jutlitial system will be in
voked il they are members of the I ni
versity community.
Furl her. we are committed to assisting
outside law enforcement agent its to
prosecute any violations < >112 state or fed
eral laws. A quit k and decisive response

In law enforcement is critical in this re
gard. but 1 would also like to sax on a
more personal note that actions sudi as
these diminish all of us in the Stanford
community — not just those who are tar
gets of the hate speech. ( onsetjuentlx . all
of us must unite in our rejection of such
behavior and do our utmost to set- that
our community is a safe and hospitable
place for all ol its members.

Alum supports Fiorina choice
1 .1111 a Stanford graduate and a prac
ticing attornex in Washington, DC. 1
caught wind of the controversx sur
rounding I niversitv President |ohn
Henncssv's selection of Carlx Fiorina as
the Commencement speaker from read
ing lli ian F.ule's opinion piece ("Just a llu
Outside: Speaker choice unclear") on
Monda\ 's online edition ol 1 he Stanford
D.iilx.
I (ould not disagree more with the dis
appointment expressed In F.ule and the
senior class over 1 fenness\ 's selection.
Kule states in his column (li.it Ins
"peers were upset because iliex thought
we might have .t formei president of the
I nited States speak at our graduation,
which would be an enormous honor."
I le implies that better alternatives could
have been found in "an inspiring female
senator from New York" or even "Nel
son Mandela."
What c i iteria ai e Kule and Ins peers
using for evaluating the sele< tion? I low
profile the speaker is? I be
amount ol "honor" the speaker would
bring t«» Stanford? Stanford alrcad\ lias
respect. We've earned ii from doing

and at hie\ nig. We do not need loft\ vis
itors to demonstrate the excellence of
our institution.
Moreover, Stanford hosts famous
speakers all the time. I was at Stanford
when then-Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev delivered a speech in
Memorial Auditorium. 11 is speech was
ver\ interesting and brought a lot of at
tention to the I niversitx. but I wouldn't
have wanted him as a Commencement
speaker.
What do the Clintons or Mandela
have to offer graduating Stanford stu
dents over Carlx Fiorina? None ol them
have am Stanford connection .is far as I
know. (Though Mandela may appreciate
that Stanford divested in the 1980s from
companies that operated in South
Africa.) Moreover, the success the Clin
tons and Mandela have bad in the politi
cal sphere offers little to the average
graduate. Fvervone knows their stor\.
We've already heard what the\ have to
sa\. I heir speeches would have attracted
a lot of press coverage, but accomplished
little else.
( arlv Fiorina, on the other hand, was
educated at Stanford (she was a double
inajt>i in medieval hisiorv and philoso
ph\. no less). At the tender age of 11, Fio
rina look the helm ol Hewlett-Packard,
which was (and is) the world's number
two computer companx and the largest
public corporation m>i to be run bv a
woman. 1 his happened in 1999. (llv
comparison, the first leniale senator look
office about 80 years ago.)
At the lime Fiorina became president
of I lew lett-Packard, only two other com
panies out of ihe entire Fortune 500
were headed In women. Inothci words,
Fioi ma has at complishcd something lew
women have accomplished before. She
lias demonstrated that women tail sue

i eed m the highest levels of business and
lias therein hla/ed .1 trail through the
glass ( tor .1 whole new generation
of women to follow. Her stor\ is impor
tant to Ixxli women and theii male col
leagues. .ukl the disdain that Fule has ex
pressed lot her demonstrates all the
more wh\ the\ will gain from the oppor
tunit\ to hc-.11 her message.
I franklx cannot think ot a better
speaker lor this year's graduation cere
mom than Fiorina, li is too bad these
-11101 (I.ins presidents disavowed their in
volvement 111 the selection. 1 would have
lauded their judgment.

Faculty and students question
Nike contract
We have learned that Stanford is on
the verge ol renewing its contract be
tween the Department of Athletics and
Nike, which involves student-athletes
advertising lor the Nike corporation as
part of their participation in Stanford
sponsored activities. \\x wearing jersevs,
shorts, sweats and caps that directly asso
ciate Stanford's name with the Nike cor
poration. the students are partv to the
I niversitv's decision to promote Nike
products.
We. the undersigned members of the
Stanford community, suspect that such .1
contract threatens principles and pro
prieties that the I nivcisitv should (and
indeed claims to) uphold. I he impend
ing Nike contract raises the following
questions:
As <1 non-profit organization, should
Stanford contractually agree to adver
tise for .1 for-profit corporation, with
Stanford students as the beat ers of that
advertising ?
If Stanford chooses to advertise for
such corporations, what criteria does it
use to screen those it decides to repre
sent? Are there any corporations for
which Stanford would not advertise?
Nike, for example, has .1 well-docu
mented record of human rights abuses
in the past. These include the employ
ment of child labor, the use of toxic ele
ments in shoe manufacture, the ex

ploitation of I bird World workers (all
conveniently subcontracted), inade
quate wages, sexual harassment (most
of the sewers, stitchers and gluers are
Noting women), forced overtime, physi
cal abuse and firing union organizers.
Docs th.it matter?
If Stanford contracts with Nike, what
spec ific measures is the I niversitv taking
to ensure that Nike operates in .1 fashion
consistent with the values of the I niver
sitv? Scores of universities with athletic
apparel contracts (most recently Notre
Dame) have joined the Workers' Rights
Consortium, which tries to monitor
working conditions. Whv hasn't Stan
ford done the same?
If the contract contains an "opt-out"
clause for student athletes, what mea
sures is the UnivcrsitN taking to ensure
there is no Athletics Department pres
sure against a student's exercising that
option? 1 lie Athletics Department is a
direct benefit iarv of Nike "largesse"
(purportedly, the contract is worth $2
million per vcar, with $10,000 paid
back from Stanford to Nike for each
Stanford athlete who "opts out"). If this
is indeed the arrangement, then the
Athletics Department lacks incentives
to publicize the opt-out clause or pro
vide the kind of self-critical environ
ment to make it viable.
What educational programs do the
Athletics Department and the University
propose to make the opt-out option
meaningful? If the institution contracts

ii* students to advertise lor Nike, then n
is responsible for laving out tullv the na
ture ol students' commitment, the choic
es before them and the reasons thc\
might w ish not to advertise tor Nike.
II Stanford, as an institution, tries to
retrain from taking moral and ethical
stands on issues where reasonable peo
ple disagree, then how does it justih
m.iking a contractual arrangement to
advertise Nike products, given that
members ol the Stanford commuuit\
have expressed public l\ that the institu
tion should not take such .1 pro-corpo
rate, pro-Nike stand, particularly on the
bodies ol its students?
We look forward to .1 response to
these questions and to open debate in
various I nivcrsitv forums on these is
sues before any contract with Nike is
signed.

Faculty and students question
Nike contract
We have learned that Stanford is on
the verge ol renewing its contract be
tween the Department of Athletics and
Nike, which involves student-athletes
advertising lor the Nike corporation as
part of their participation in Stanford
sponsored activities. \\x wearing jersevs,
shorts, sweats and caps that directly asso
ciate Stanford's name with the Nike cor
poration. the students are partv to the
I niversitv's decision to promote Nike
products.
We. the undersigned members of the
Stanford community, suspect that such .1
contract threatens principles and pro
prieties that the I nivcisitv should (and
indeed claims to) uphold. I he impend
ing Nike contract raises the following
questions:
As <1 non-profit organization, should
Stanford contractually agree to adver
tise for .1 for-profit corporation, with
Stanford students as the beat ers of that
advertising ?
If Stanford chooses to advertise for
such corporations, what criteria does it
use to screen those it decides to repre
sent? Are there any corporations for
which Stanford would not advertise?
Nike, for example, has .1 well-docu
mented record of human rights abuses
in the past. These include the employ
ment of child labor, the use of toxic ele
ments in shoe manufacture, the ex

ploitation of I bird World workers (all
conveniently subcontracted), inade
quate wages, sexual harassment (most
of the sewers, stitchers and gluers are
Noting women), forced overtime, physi
cal abuse and firing union organizers.
Docs th.it matter?
If Stanford contracts with Nike, what
spec ific measures is the I niversitv taking
to ensure that Nike operates in .1 fashion
consistent with the values of the I niver
sitv? Scores of universities with athletic
apparel contracts (most recently Notre
Dame) have joined the Workers' Rights
Consortium, which tries to monitor
working conditions. Whv hasn't Stan
ford done the same?
If the contract contains an "opt-out"
clause for student athletes, what mea
sures is the UnivcrsitN taking to ensure
there is no Athletics Department pres
sure against a student's exercising that
option? 1 lie Athletics Department is a
direct benefit iarv of Nike "largesse"
(purportedly, the contract is worth $2
million per vcar, with $10,000 paid
back from Stanford to Nike for each
Stanford athlete who "opts out"). If this
is indeed the arrangement, then the
Athletics Department lacks incentives
to publicize the opt-out clause or pro
vide the kind of self-critical environ
ment to make it viable.
What educational programs do the
Athletics Department and the University
propose to make the opt-out option
meaningful? If the institution contracts

ii* students to advertise lor Nike, then n
is responsible for laving out tullv the na
ture ol students' commitment, the choic
es before them and the reasons thc\
might w ish not to advertise tor Nike.
II Stanford, as an institution, tries to
retrain from taking moral and ethical
stands on issues where reasonable peo
ple disagree, then how does it justih
m.iking a contractual arrangement to
advertise Nike products, given that
members ol the Stanford commuuit\
have expressed public l\ that the institu
tion should not take such .1 pro-corpo
rate, pro-Nike stand, particularly on the
bodies ol its students?
We look forward to .1 response to
these questions and to open debate in
various I nivcrsitv forums on these is
sues before any contract with Nike is
signed.

Provost responds to Nike letter
I niversity President John Hennessy and
I understand the divergent views ot tat ult\.
students and stall on the Nike matter, and
we appreciate the reasonable manner in
which the concerns have been expressed.
While negotiations are confidential,
we do feel it is important to note that the
information regarding a cont rat i includ
ed in the open letter is not accurate.
C )ur one and only interest in negotiat
ing with Nike is to support our student
athletes. Without equipment contracts
1 ike this, the Department of Athletics
would not be able to pro\ itle main ot our
student-athletes with uniforms and
equipment. We would be fated with
three options: require students to bu\
their own equipment, eliminate some
teams or subsidize the intercollegiate
athletic program with general I nivei sii\
funds — something we have never done
before.
As an institution and as individuals,
we are concerned about the working
conditions at companies with whom we
have a relationship, and we expet I them

to complv with the law in this regard.
Nonetheless, we deal with too main out
side contractors to take on the responsi
bilitv for monitoring those working con
ditions in a meaningful wav. Nike as
cribes to the Collegiate Licensing Com
panv Code ot Conduct and the Fair
I .abor Association (.ode of Conduct and
employs far more people in its monitor
ing operation than any comparable com
pan\. I liven the options, we feel this is a
respectable solution.
Still, we recognize that there may Ik*
some student-athletes who would rather
not wear corporate logos. A simple pro
cess is being put in place to ensure that
these students may opt out of wearing
the logo. I will be the final arbiter ot am
such case, and I can sav that 1 would nat
urally tend to support an athlete's re
quest to "opt out. I best* are tough is
sues, and I want to reiterate nn respect
for those w hose views differ from mine.

Kule states in his column (li.it Ins
"peers were upset because iliex thought

I le implies that better alternatives could
have been found in "an inspiring female

What c i iteria ai e Kule and Ins peers

respect. We've earned ii from doing

Moreover, Stanford hosts famous
speakers all the time. I was at Stanford
when then-Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev delivered a speech in
Memorial Auditorium. 11 is speech was
ver\ interesting and brought a lot of at
tention to the I niversitx. but I wouldn't
have wanted him as a Commencement
speaker.
What do the Clintons or Mandela
have to offer graduating Stanford stu
dents over Carlx Fiorina? None ol them
have am Stanford connection .is far as I
know. (Though Mandela may appreciate
that Stanford divested in the 1980s from
companies that operated in South
Africa.) Moreover, the success the Clin
tons and Mandela have bad in the politi
cal sphere offers little to the average
graduate. Fvervone knows their stor\.
We've already heard what the\ have to
sa\. I heir speeches would have attracted
a lot of press coverage, but accomplished
little else.
( arlv Fiorina, on the other hand, was
educated at Stanford (she was a double

woman. 1 his happened in 1999. (llv
comparison, the first leniale senator look

At the lime Fiorina became president
of I lew lett-Packard, only two other com
