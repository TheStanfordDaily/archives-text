Editor \ Nolr: litis is I In- second article ni as fi
nes examining the Honor ('ode and its impart
on the Stanford t ommunit\. Iliese articles
were written as a class project for Communica

during winter quartet.
When .1 student last war copied anoth
ci student's program that had been left on
a computet screen in Mever Library and
tried to pass n oil .is his own work, it was .t
reminder that Stanford's high-tech facili
ties are .1 double-edged sword.
With problem-set solutions now online
and extracurricular announcements sent
through e-mail, computers are .111 integral
part o! lile on campus. Hut it is this same
technology that has also become a hot tool
lot 1 heating.
('.heating is a national problem. I larried
!>\ college requirements, hounded bv
push\ parents, and now tempted b\ these
new technologies, mam college students
are turning to sites like www.col
legetetinp.ipers.com. Cut-and-paste is re
plat ing think-and-wt ite.
"It's pist too easv." said Don Mc(iabe, a
Rutgers I nivcrsii\ management professot
who has studied (heating for the p.ist
decade, in a recent interview. In .1 survc\
last I.ill. nearlv 10 percent ot college stu
dents (ontessed to stealing p.ipet s from the
Internet.
" 1 here's no (|uestion that the level ot
(heating is distuibitigb high. McC.abe
said.
National studies suggest .1 dose rela
tionship between increasing access to high
tech devices and more incidents of cheat
ing. This seems to be the case at Stanford as
well, with the Computer Science Depart
ment leading the pack in terms of number

of alleged incidents reported.
Of the 52 reports made last war, 18
came from the Computer Science Depart
ment — more than three times as manv as
any other department.
According to judicial advisor I.aurette
lieeson, this pattern is not unusual.
"It's common and consistent across the
countnßeeson said.
One reason lor the preponderance of
i oniputer s< ience fraud cases is that plagia
rism and collaboration are easier to detect
in computer code than in something like
an cssa\ answer in which a student can
change ke\ words to avert suspicion.
('.oniputer scictu e students also tend to
feel extt aordin.it \ pressure to make a pro
gram work. Alter several cattcine-lilled
nights in Sweet 11 all. it can be hard to resist
a pointer horn a friend.
"If you've spent 10 bouts stating at a
screen and |ust can't figure the thing out,
and someone offers you a 10-second solu
tion to the problem, it can be very tempt
ing." says Krik I /re.in. a former computer
science teaching assistant.
Students looking for shortcuts when
writing term papers can turn to Web sites
