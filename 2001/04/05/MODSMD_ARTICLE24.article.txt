"It's pist too easv." said Don Mc(iabe, a

said.
National studies suggest .1 dose rela
tionship between increasing access to high
tech devices and more incidents of cheat
ing. This seems to be the case at Stanford as
well, with the Computer Science Depart
ment leading the pack in terms of number

of alleged incidents reported.
Of the 52 reports made last war, 18
came from the Computer Science Depart
ment — more than three times as manv as
any other department.
According to judicial advisor I.aurette
lieeson, this pattern is not unusual.
"It's common and consistent across the
countnßeeson said.
One reason lor the preponderance of
i oniputer s< ience fraud cases is that plagia

in computer code than in something like
an cssa\ answer in which a student can

"If you've spent 10 bouts stating at a

Students looking for shortcuts when
writing term papers can turn to Web sites
like clieathouse.com. Also known as I be

Fa il I louse of Cheat, this site has
over 9,500 essays in M categories.
It claims to have been "leading
the industry since 1995" and to
have served more than M million.
Prices range from $("> fora
ready-made css.iv to $500 tor a
custom-written doctoral-level phi
losophy paper.
The Web is not the only worry.
F-mail can enable illegal collabo
ration. Cbanning Robertson, a
professor of chemical engineer
ing, knows of a case where stu
dents divided up an assignment
such that every student worked on
onl\ one or two problems.
With one simple click of the
"Send" button, the rest of the
group had each other's answers
instantly.
On the other hand, as some
point out, e-mailing answers is a
very easy way to get caught.
1 lien there's the scavenger
method.

cheat is to steal papers, assign

In a sign that the University is
not taking anything for granted,
Stanford recently signed a con
tract with plagiarism.org, a ser
vice that compares students' sub
missions against sources available
online.
Kven so. Stanford was one of
the last universities to join the
bandwagon.
C )ther institutions, including UC

similar measures years ago.
Flie.se campuses represent a
growing number of institutions
that are fighting back with tech

Using plagiarism.org, I C-
Bcrkelev professors are reported
to have found that 150 students

from two classes had taken their
writing from other sources.
Another anti-chcating service,
iParadigm, claims, " I he system is
so powerful, it can detect similari
ties between papers down to the
length of about eight words."
I nlike l'exas AX.M and UC-
Davis, where students are re
quired to submit their essays
through sites like plagiarism.org
lot si reening, Stanford only turns
to such electronic checks once a
teacher lias reason to believe a stu
dent's work might not be his own.
Furthermore, blanket use of
such technology could violate the
Honor Code, which bars faculty
from taking "unusual and unrea
sonable precautions" in academic
procedures.
Some also note that cheaters
could easily outsmart tlu- software
b\ lifting ideas but changing the
words.
"Stanford students are smart
enough that they know how to
make these ideas sound like their
own. and the professors and I As

Beeson saws that, of the 10 pla
giarism eases heard at Stanford so
far this year, onlv one was online

electronic: services.
"Normally, these cases come
about because professors or lAs
notice that the paper's style is not
consistent with previously written
assignments." Beeson said.
