## Card squeezes past Spartans Dragicevich's hit in the top of the 10th gives Stanford a 5-3 win 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At fust, comparisons of this year's
Stanford baseball team with the 2000
(.ollege World Series version were hum
bling. After a few weeks, they were over
done. Now, they're flat out interesting.
After a 5-3, 10-iniiing victory Tues
day night at Municipal Stadium over the
San Jose State Spartans, the No. 1 Car
dinal improved to 25-(> on the year (5-1
Pacific 10 Conference) with its 1 Ith win
in its last 12 games. Last season at ibis
point, as Stanford entered its third
weekend of l\u -10 play, the team held a
22-9 record and was jllsi 3-3 in league
games.
Ibis year's version is batting almost
20 points higher and b.is already stolen
twice as many bases .is last season's, sta
tistics that jump out considering the un
certainty surrounding the Cardinal
heading into the 2001 season.
I lie most surprising comparison,
however, is the one between the pitch
ing staffs from a year ago and this sea

son. Last year's highly touted starting
corps of Justin Wayne, Jason Young
and Brian Sager ended the season with
a 3.76 ERA.
So far, sophomores Jerenn Guthrie
and Tim Cunningham and junior Jeff
Bruksch have combined fora 17-0
record with a 2.33 ERA, a glaring and
shocking improvement over a stall with
two of the top 47 selections in the 2000
Major League Baseball draft in Wavne
and Young. 1 ielping the pitching staff is
a dvnamite Cardinal defense that has
finished 15 of its 31 games without a sin
gle error.
1 he latest win for the Cardinal came
at the hands of junior shortstop Scott
Dragicevich, whose two-out, two-RBI
single with the bases loaded in the top
of the 10th inning on I uesdav night
gave Stanford the lead for good. He
pulled the ball through the left side of
the infield to score junior Chris O'Rior
dan and freshman Sain Kuld and break
the 3-3 tie.
"1 knew he (San Jose State pitc hei |e
remy Rogelstad) was going to come after
me because 1 didn't have am open
bases," Dragicevich said. " 1 lie pitch I bit
was a slider, and 1 was able to get the
barrel of the bat on it."
Reliever Mike Wodnicki picked up
the victory after pitching an easy 1-2-3

bottom ot the 10th with two strikeouts
.ind an infield pop-up. I lit- junior en
tered in tlie seventh inning and allowed
the Spartans to tie the game at three on
an RUI single credited to Stanford's
|ason I.uker. Wodnieki got the next hat
ter to fl\ out and held the Spartans scot e
less for the remaintlei of the game.

an 18-for-80 (.225) slump ovet the past
20 games with three liitn on 1 uesda\
night, including a leadofl home inn to
start the game.
O'Riordan scored again on a Carlos
(Juentin third-inning single, tipping
Quentin's numbers to a team-leading
.357 average with 21 RBI. O'Riordan.
the ('.ardinal second baseman, began the
vear on fire, but his average, whit h stood
well above .400 for several weeks, has
fallen to .3 17 over the past month.
In the sixth, three singles b\ junior
