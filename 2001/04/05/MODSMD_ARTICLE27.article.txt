The warning should read:
"This is not the real thing."
" The real thing" would be 111

the PING ASI In\itati<>nal. All
10 Pac -10 teams will be part of

be feeling some sense of ur

see yourselves holding that
championship trophy,' " Rho
said. "And. .is a team, we do
need a win soon to reassure
ourselves that we are really that

The team might need some
reassurance, but the rest of its
competition no doubt has a
good understanding of No. 4
Stanford's potential. II not loi
mediocre opening rounds in its
last two tournaments, the Cardi
nal would have had a chance to
pick up a victory or two.
