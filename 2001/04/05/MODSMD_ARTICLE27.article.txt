Caroline O'Connor might want
to hold a disclaimer in front ot
her team this week before the
players tee off in I empe. Ariz.
The warning should read:
"This is not the real thing."

are still two weeks awav but will
be plaved on the same course

freshman Angela Rho said.
But, with the Pac-1() and
NC.AA Championships looming
in near future, the squad must
be feeling some sense of ur

only top-five team without a vic
tory so far this year. O'Connor
has begun to stress the impor
tance of that to her team as the
spring season wears on.
"She says. 'You guvs have to
see yourselves holding that
championship trophy,' " Rho
said. "And. .is a team, we do
need a win soon to reassure
ourselves that we are really that
g< >od."
The team might need some
reassurance, but the rest of its
competition no doubt has a
good understanding of No. 4
Stanford's potential. II not loi
mediocre opening rounds in its
last two tournaments, the Cardi

pick up a victory or two.
