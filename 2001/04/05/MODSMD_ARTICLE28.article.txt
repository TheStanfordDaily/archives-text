### SARA LEV CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While mam Stanford students
jetted oft to warm and sunn\ spring
break destinations in Cancun or
Ma/atlan, the women's lacrosse
team packed its warmest sweaters
and headed to icy New York and
Pennsylvania fi>r a week of hard
fought contests against talented
East (oast lacrosse teams.
I lie Cardinal started the week
off strong on Sunday. March 25,
with a decisive I l-(> victory over the
Lifayettc Ixopards, upping the
(lard record toS-l. I he team then
suffered a dip in momentum to
ward the end of the week, losing to
the (Cornell Big Red. 15-5, on
Man h 27. and hat ch surrendering
a 1 f-IH overtime battle to the I lar
vard ( aimson on March 29.
The losses to Cornell and Har
vard snapped .i 1-0 winning streak
fot the team. According to coach
Mic hele I hlfelder, the losses were a
gc k h I lesson for her plavers. "The
minute you relax and start testing,
sav ing.'()h. we're 8-I.' is the minute
miii lose your edge," she said. " The
Harvard and Cornell games were
far from the best we can play. 1 hose
games forced us to check in and
make sine we were keeping in tune
with the challenges we were facing."
There was no question, howev
er, that the Cardinal was abla/e
against Lafavcttc in its first game
of the week. Stanford had a fast
start against the Leopards, scoring
7 unanswered goals in the first 22
minutes of tlu- game. After that,
there was no stopping the Card.

Stanford never relinquished its
lead, leaving the field with an 1 l-(>
win.
I he 1 Mitavette game was great,"
said senior tri-captain Katherine
Barnes. "We came out strong and
never realK faltered. It was a satisfy
ing game."
Stanford was on a '3-0 winning
streak going into the Lafayette
mate h, but the team was coming oft
a two-week break in competition
because of Dead Week and finals.
\\ e came off of two weeks of solid
practice." said junior tri-captain
Caroline Osterwise, "but we still
played at a high level against
Lifavettc. It felt like we moved for
ward from out last game. I here was
no stepping off or stagnating at all."
I hlfelder agreed that the lull
in competition before the break
was ,i c hallenge that her team was
able to meet. "It's important to
get back in the driver's seat," she
s.iid, "and our motto this year is to
pic k tip each game where we left
off . . . the girls were mentally
there and excited to play."
1 lie game against Cornell on
Tuesday was ,idifferent storv. Stan
ford let the si <>rc slide to 9-0 in (Cor
nell's favor at halftime, forcing the
team to spend the rest of the game
trying to catch up. Sophomore Li/
Lmcsc scored the first goal for the
(.ardinal at 2:25 in the second half,
and freshman Alibi Hills followed
suit. I hen. in the last three minutes
of the game. Battles put in two
