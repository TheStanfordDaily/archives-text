# Stanford rugby controversially forfeits to Golden Bears
## 
### 
They're not scared. Let's get this
right out in the open, first
things first, because that's what
they want yon to know. I he
Stanford men's rugby team is not afraid of
Cal.
Let's also get this right out: Ihev're not
going to play Cal. The team has forfeited
its scheduled April 7 game with Cal, citing
concerns about the safety of their players
and the integrity of the series itself.
But when they say they're not stared,
they mean it. This is not a defensive "we're
not scared," not an easv-foi-you-to-say
comment tossed during a headlong re
treat. It's a correction for anyone who
cares to suggest that the men of the team
are motivated by fear.
The events are pretty clear. On March
10, several weeks of discussion among
team members about forfeiting came to .1

head when the rugby team and head
coach Franck Boivert met with Director of
Athletics l ed Iceland and representatives
of the Stanford Rugby Foundation, the
team's alumni group.
Despite some questions, the alumni and
I.eland agreed at that point that "regard
less of what we decided to do, they were
going to support us," senior and team
president John Shenk said.
On March 14, after a short discussion
with C.al head coach Jack Clark, Boivert e
mailcd the league with the team's dec ision:
They wanted to forfeit.
"The team honestly thinks that it will be
detrimental to the tradition to c hallenge
Cal this year," Boivert said in the e-mail.
"When .1 featherweight is to fight a heavy
weight, there is no rivalry, it is a farce ...
Stanford plavingCal in rugby has reached
this farcical stage, and Stanford rugby

wants to be no pari of a farce."
The forfeit touched oil a firestorm of
media coverage, starting with tlu- Daily

Cal. running through
Bay Area newspapers,
lately finding its way to
Sports Illustrated.
It's also inspired
team wide bemusement
from the Cardinal.
"Let's say Cal is
Notre Dame football.
You can make us Palo
Alto High football.

That's the disparity," Shenk said.
There lies the 1 rux of the issue. No one
argues that Cal rugbv is a vastly superioi
program to Stanford's at this point. I lie
numbers are simple:
Cal is the reigning national champion
tor the 1 Oth straight year.

One third of its starting lineup is 011 the
L.S. National ream.
It is 1 2-1 this year, having lost to British
( olumhia. 27-25. Stanford is !i-8.
Cal's record against I nited Slates
teams since 1996 is 08-0, its List loss com
ing to Stanford in 1990, a loss which itsell
ended a 98-game winning streak against
domestic opponents.
Stanford lost to Chico State this season,
34-25. Cal Ixat them 97-0. Stanford was
trounced by St. Mary's, 34-10; Cal beat
them. 78-14. Stanford's average point mar
gin this year is -8.30 points; ('.al's is +50.38.
What Boivert, Shenk and the rest of the
team found themselves faced with is a
thorm question. To hear some talk about
it. it's a question about the integrity of
sports and the purity of competition, lo
hear others, its just cost-benefit analysis.
W hen is a loss too bad? W hen is a

blowout not worth playing?
I he traditional answer's easy, and it's
the one (I a1 k and the Berkeley team have
suggested: YOll always plav.
"Rugby's a funny game," Clark said.
" 1 his i> not the best Stanford team I've
fared in the last 25 years, but it's In no
means the worst."
In othei words, the games aren't
played 011 paper. Sure, the Stanford play
ers' own mothers wouldn't have bet on
them in this game. But let's sav I'NC

concerned?
But Stanford plavcrs suggest there's a
ke\ difference. "We're a club sport and
we're dub athletes, and there's no 'have

eo-term (aptain Mike ( vballos. "If
we < 1 1< Â»< not to |>la\ somebtxh 111

the repercussions of it.
Boivert's e-mail was explicit:
"Stanford has no teat ol losing ver

Boivert s.iid, " I hex are. however,

I he t|uestion. though, returns.
What's the difference between
being smart and being stared?

"1 111 not scared of (-al," Slunk
said. "I'm not sea ret I to lose."
"As a leader of the team, vou
tan trx to prove xour braveix bx

vou can prove it and keep them

"1 would never sax we're proud
of doing what we did or that we're
okax with it, but we'xe kind ol been
forced to make a statement," said
senior Dan Ross. "When C.al's

being done about tli.it ... I think
it's our wax of sax ing something

Will the series 1 etui 11?
"I hope so," ( lark said.
" I here are more similarities be
tween these programs than there
are differences."
"I don't know bx what means, I
don't know when." Shenk said,
"but [Stanford and ( al) will find a
wax to compete."
When can vou sax a loss is okax ?
When can vou stop plax ing?
