After riding this high, the album lets the listener
down by slipping in to sub-par imitations of Floydian
ballads. 1 racks like " Fired" and "Swell" sound like
tracks found on Pink Floyd's obscure H)(>9 album,
"More." 1 here is even a hint of "For the benefit ol Mr.

However, there is a majoi difference between the
Flovdian ballads and the Lupine Howl songs. Whereas
the Floydian ballads morphed into different songs, .is
seen most clearU on "Dark Side ol the Moon, the
Lupine I lowl songs are repetitive and leave the listenei
with something to be desired.
Hut there is something to be said for Lupine Howl's
effective use ol psvchcdelic sounds that pervade the
album. "125" has a ver\ aloof, listless feel to it. .is well .is
