# "The Invasion From Within"
## Tsunami Bomb 
### Josh Covington, Editorial Staff 
I mid.uni Bomb is .1 pop-punk fivesome from Southern
California that dispenses injections, plodding, rhvthmk
punk complete with ti.ui. blistering rapid-lire female vocals.
I lie group's new (.1)." I lie Invasion From Within!" features
si\ tongue-in-cheek pop-punk anthems that'll make you wig
gle like vou've got Yiiuent Price in vour pants.
I lie first thing vou'll notice upon contact with this, the
band's first digital release is that I sunami Bomb lias a sort
of trenih (loth love affair with the macabre. I bis vainpii
ic tenor plays out boldh in the band's liner notes, in w hie li
clip-art bats and campv horror-esque fonts compete for at
tent ion. but it fails to come through as st rough in the musii
itself, which has a fairb standard pop-punk sound, save
the odd pipe organ sample.
I'a\ attention to song one — it's the only song which
vaguely captures the vanipiric fervor, so prevalent in the
band's artwork. In superimposing its fairly standard So
(ial pop-punk sound over an organ sample. Song two is m\
personal favorite. It's kind of antheim and refreshingh
stripped down compared to some of the more giinmii k\
tracks. Track five is the last one I feel like endorsing — it
stands out l\ rii alb on the album with gems like. "No more
shit, this is it I'm leaving for myself and no one else /So
long been swell See \ou in hell."
As much as I enjoved this album, I'd recommend
that von tr\ to catch I sunami Bomb live if you're at all
interested in the band, as the group's (II) still fails to
capture the full \<>iitlifiil exuberance of its live shows.
