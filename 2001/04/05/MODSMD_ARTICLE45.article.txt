"I le.it tbreakers is the kind of movie that von see the prey iew for and cringe. It has all
<>l the ingredients ol something terrible: aging st.us who havi' been oil die map lot a
whi If. .1 sills plot ,md |( linili-I I o\ e Hewitt. Ii is t lie movie that von automatiealh write
oil as someone's elaboi ate e\c use to jict Hewitt to wear dresses that eovei the bat e mill -
imiiin ol flesh: all silicone and no substance. It's the movie that von love to hate. I hat is
uli\ I am lairh ashamed that I liked ibis movie.
Maybe it's because I had siu li low expectations. ()i mavbe il was because this movie
did a good job playing the acting talents ol Nigourney Weavet and Hewitt oil ol each
other. I he plot, though foolish, is laid out intelligentl\.
Weavet and Hewitt pla\ a inothet dauuhtei con-team with a lairh loolprool way ol

stealing money from rich men.
Wea\ ei mat ties t hem. I lew it I
dresses like "Prostitute Barbie" and
rubs hersell up against the newly
wed husband, Weavet finds them
togethei and, viola the divorce
settlements pile up in the bank.
\s i i(lu uloiis as this premise
is. the movie nevei takes itsell too
seriously, and the plot never be
comes too predic table. Some jokes
are cheap, sound-byte material
like when Hewitt asks a surprised
Kevin Neelan if she c an grab his
nuts peanuts, of course â€” what
a hilaiions mix-up!
1 he majority of the humor,
however, is lairh subtle and
doesn't always take advantage ol
obvious, c rude jokes. I he intricate
traps Hewitt and Weaver la\ for

the rich men, as
well as the w.i\ they
select then \ic tinis,
are surprisingly
c ley ei And the
piobleins that arise
and the solutions
the women invent
to solve them aren't
overly predictable.
In this sell s e,
"Ilealt biea kei s
succeeds where
movies like "Meet
the I'aicuts failed.
I he real star ol
this movie was
|ast>n I ee ("( Jerks
and " Dogma"),
whose c 1 i \ humor
and seamless deliy
erv brought a truly

believ able and likeable chat acter to tlu- table. Ix-e is t lit- objei tot I leu itt's love hate, and,
consequent!). he becomes entwined in the ever-grov\ing web of lies that are spun.
Ra\ Liotta also puts in a great performance as one ol Weaver's jilted lovers, an unwit
ting vi( titn of the < on. I le brings another element ol spontaneity to the movie, keeping it
fresh and ((liferent from what one might expect.
Yes. Ilewitt's boobs appear so much that the\ deserve their own credit at the end of
the movie. No." I leartbreakers" is not a movie with .1 message or even a purpose. But in
spite of. 01 perhaps because of. its self-acknowledged frivolitv, "Heartbreakers" was a
ver\ entertaining movie. But don't tell anvone I said that.

That's good, honey. Now practice relaxing your throat muscles
