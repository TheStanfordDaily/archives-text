# Depp, Cruz blow lines in Demme's new flick
## 
### SARAH MEARON EDITORIAL STAFF 
Oh, to he young and liberated
in the '70s: an era of sex, drugs
and rock 'n' roll — super-sized.
(lould you ask lor anything more?
Hollywood has recreated this
decade several times over the
years. Most recently, Dirk hig
gler and his third arm served as
tour guides through the '70s
porn industry in "Boogie
Nights,'" and self-proclaimed
"hand aid" Penny Lane made
classic rock cool again in "Almost
Famous."
So that just leaves the drugs,
which is where "Blow" comes in.

Based on a true story, the film
chronicles the life of (leorge Jung
(Johnn\ Depp), the son of a New
England woi king-class couple
who grew up to become the
largest distributor of cocaine in
the United States.
But the crux ol this movie
isn't dope. Although Cleorge's
role as Pablo Escobar's right
hand man made him a target ol
the FBI, there were much big
ger issues at stake. Amid the
endless stacks of cash and the
bags of blow was a man who en
visioned making a life for him
self that was better than (hat of
bis parents, one where .inxieiv

over money and marriage were
non-existent.
Depp morphs into tlit* role ol
George with a charisma that is
hard to ignore. I le truly talks tin
talk .md walks tlu- walk ol his real
life counterpart, adopting a con
vincing New Kngland accent .md

In doing so, Depp skillful
