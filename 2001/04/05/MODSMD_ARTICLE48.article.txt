Harry is basically <1 decent
( ha 1 .it tei beset on .ill sides by his
woi lies, and Rush, who made Ins
name plaving mental patients,
("Shine." "(Quills"), was an 111-

spired tasting choice. Hut Bros
nan. who (le.u Ix relishes the 1 art

opportunitx to plax a villain,
steals the show with lines like,
"Spying is dark and lonely work,
like oral sex." I"he subtext ual
Bond references of Brosnan's
Mephistophelean character,
along with the intelligent direct-

ing ol |ohn boot man
("Hope & (.lotv." "De
liverance" and"The
(ieneral") actually make
the movie version of
"Tailor" better than the
book.
Panama is pre
sented m the film as a
plate for exiles and ex
cons. a l inn! World,
post-(lold War b.u kxva
tei "(las.ihlanca without
heroes" is how Harry
puts it. Moorman's cam
era lingers long (and
fete hi uglv) over the
slums and brothels of
Panama (atx, and Os
nard likes to hold his
meetings in run-down
whorehouses or gay bars
(you can almost heat 1.111
Fleming turning in his
urave durine .111 e\( el-

Inn slow-dance scene involving
the two male leads).

However, the real target of
most of the film's satirical vitriol is
not the Panamanians or even the
British, but the American gener
als .in<l politicians (Bush pere in
particular) whose helicopters are
always waiting in the wings, ready
to lob a few bombs southward on
am pretext whatsoever. This film
will provide a welcome anti-
Bruckheimer vaccination for
those who fear the flag-wrapped
saccharine of this summer's
would-be blockbuster, "The
American rriumph.it Pearl Har
bor" (working title).
"Tailor," despite its virtues,
does not seem destined to bust
any blocks itself; the studio (Co
lumbia) Ifas liardh publicized it.
and the film, wlnch was supposed
to come out months ago, was
plagued b\ delays and rumors of
on-set problems. The juiciest
rumor involves ,iti angry Boor
man rebuking his all-Irish techni
cal crew for spending the bulk of
their time on location in Pana
manian brothels. Making movies,
apparently. is also dark and lone
l\ work.
