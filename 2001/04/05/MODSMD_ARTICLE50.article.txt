You know what? Some fun stufl has been
going down in the (ity lately, like the Shift
happv hour and fashion show held at the

Yerba Benna Center for the Arts last Friday.
Sponsored by Free Maga/ine, the show fea
tured hometown heroes VAMP Designs. Do you
remember where von were then? Probably Anto
nio's or (lompadres, maybe a part\ or a Block
buster trip and a six pack.
Don't gel me wrong, these are .til valuable Stan
ford memories you'll cherish until your stretch
marks slowly recede into wrinkles and vonr lus
cious locks tnr 11 grav. Hut didn't vou gel enough
of Senior Pub Nights, lraternit\ parties arid puk

your freshman year, when it was still fresh and
somewhat taboo?
Maybe it's time you graduated from the Stanford
/ Shallow Vlto scene and started making it out to
the Big (iii\ like \ou've always s.iul \ou wen
going to. Since \on mi>sed the fun last Fi ida\, I'll
tr\ and give you the succinct version of m\
evening ami allow von to deconstriu i vicai iouslv.

ceeded to wait in line again lor free "French h'orange cosmopolitans. Ihe evening ofii

(ialh began at FriU) p.m. but. even with our late ai 1 ival, we were still left with ample time
before the fashion show part artualh began, so we wandereel aimlessly around the

backstage area and made general nuisances ol ourselves and-our press privileges.
At around 7:30 p.m., I>| Laird cleared .1 runway path through the crowd (.1 plan
w hit h resulted in remark abb little heckling of the models), and the tiasco was read \

to begin.
I lie show ki( keel of I with a drag queen in a frilly tropical green dress who
(lanced her wa\ through the crowd to a 1 aiin beat, followed by two girls with para
sols.
\ AMI' Designs, the brainchild of Stanford graduates l)ina I'ugh and |en Lai,

were up next. Their
designs seemed
more dow 11 to earth
and ntiiit.iii.nl tli.m

and featured skills

and shirts with simple
lines for both men and
women.

Y.WI I* ma\ have been

ever\< >it it the fashion show was there to have fun and b« >eert, in
# (
the crow d and the non-professional status of the models, the line be
tween lerlorniers and < rowd was de< idedh blurred and the ovt rid
ing theme ol the evening was one of do-it outsell craftiness and It
without pretense.
1 o be honest. 1 probably know a lot less about M\lr than von do
so, instead of tumbling tit describe ever\ garment, 1 d like to suggest
that you make it to the next VAMP function and see I<>i \ <>111 self how

the bartender to give
me straight vodka."
"We have the
cleavage seats. "
"When I die, I want
to come back as

"Oh, sweet, black 's

"I forgot how much I
like attractive girls."
"I'm  not getting

"Don't you hate
