111 a i coin pi ised most ol the show. Salmon s
veision ol (his t lassie song was awesome.
I he climax came during the final verse,
when St ott, the in\ sterious dancing "bro,"
started rapping ovei the top. In the ensu
ing jam and throughout Ins time on stage,
Scott interacted with the audience, danc
ing 011 the edge <>112 the stage and grabbing
peoples upstretched hands. I found his
pei foi mauce ver\ heroic — in a good way
partic ularh his solo during the encore

In the final analvsis, the self-applied
label, "Polvethnic ( ajun Slanigrass"
(which contains two words not 1 ecognized
h\ nn Microsoft Word dictionary) seems
like a Utopian description of what .1 Left

And now lor an utterh inadequate list of
