Searching for the Shortest Network:
A Math Lecture for the Public
There are many situations in which one would like to connect a collection of points in same metric space by a network having the
minimum possible total length. Such problems have a long and distinguished history, and occur in such areas as the design and
analysis of telecommunications, networks, and heating and air-conditioning duct systems, algorithms for molecular phylogentics.
and the layout of circuits on VSLI chips, to name a few. In this talk, we survey what is known and what is not known about this
problem, and how it has been impacted by current developments in theoretical computer science.
