1927
On April (j, 1927, I lie Daily printed .111 article
about Albert VI. Bender's donation of books to the
University.
"Chosen because of their fine printing and bind
ing, a valuable collection of books both old and mod
ern has been given to the I nivei sit\ bv Albei IM. Ben
der of San Francisco, and a group of his friends. Part
of Ins collection is now on exhibition 111 espe< ialh con
structed cases that are in the libi arv in the passages be
tween the catalogue and the periodic al rooms.
"Although most of the volumes are examples of
modern work in printing and binding, and show
how the modern sivles are imitations of fifteenth
centinv printing — particularly of Nicolas |enson
and of the Flsevir Press — a tew older and more
valuable books are in< luded in the < ollection."
Bottom line: So that's where the Bing Wing's Bender Read
ing Room got its name.
