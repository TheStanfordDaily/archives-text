### TREVOR SUTTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I lie .mnual ASM flections
are scheduled lor \pril 10 and
April I I.a week earlier than iu
previous vears, and the immedi
ate transition Irom spring break
to hill (ampaign has forced some
candidate** lo redouble their ef
forts .md sac rifice c lass and ex
trac urric ular commitments in the
hopes of winning office.
Joe Narens, the ASM Elec
tions ('.ommissioner, said that, bv
spring break, all the candidates
and platloi ins had been approved
and the online handbook has
been c reatcd.
1 ( annot imagine that the can
didates .nul groups were made to
leel rushed In this, seeing that
t he\ were given the same amount
of time to complete petitions and
othci lot ins .is the\ were in the
past. " Narens said. "Also, the first
meeting for candidates and
groups was iu |anuarv so, theoret

ically, they could have been orga
nizing a campaign plan of attack
since then."
Narens also said that the elec
tion was designed to occur well be
fore midterms and major assign
ments and that all candidates were
given a timetable in their initial
meetings.
However, presidential candi
date Matt Brewer, a sophomore,
said he had to sacrifice his trip to
Oregon, the c ulmination of an
Alternative Spring Break class
lie co-taught, to organize his
campaign.
"It's a mixed blessing," Brewer
said. "It's good to get it out of the
wa\ and take classes and not be
distracted. But 1 was forced to sac
rifice m\ spring break, which was
very hard after all that work."
Brewer added that having the
time over break helped make the
campaign a smooth process.
Junior Brent Barton, also run
ning for ASS I president, said that
he was "definitely feeling the
rush." He said he received no ex
planation for the early time frame
and was eager to hear the Election
Commission's rationale. "It didn't
( hange things tremendously. 1 lad
we started later in the quarter, we
would have had more time to get
our message across, but, given the
circumstances, we just have to

work harder."
Junior Eric: l.ai. .1 senatorial
candidate, said that the dates
have not been a significant issue
in his campaign. "A difference of
one less week does not impede
the creativity and dedication that
candidates can express in their
campaigns," Lai said. "In the
end. the most important thing is
for voters to be informed .is to
when the election is being held.
I've gotten a lot of questions
about the date, so it seems t Il.lt it's
not being well public i/ed."
Junior Alex Shvart/man. also
running for ASSU I ndcrgradu
ate Senate, had .1 different opin
ion. "A lot of us came back earlv.
I would have liked to spend more
time at home," Shvart/man s.iid.
"The few days before school
started, I saw quite a few candi
dates at kinko's trying to get
fliers and posters out 111 time.
I here was also some confusion as
to exactlv when the campaign
started, on Monda\ 01 .11 mid
night on I uesdav."
Shvart/man added tll.lt he u.is
forced to miss classes and lose
sleep to ensure his campaign u.is
in order. He also said, however,
that he did not think that most
people had to make an\ signili
cant changes to iheii strategies,
just that tlie\ were 1 ushecl.
