Fhe commission also neglected to properly
notify spec ial fee groups of the proper dead
lines and dates. As a result, many groups did
not know about funding, forcing current
ASSI President Seth Newton to call an emer

for example.
Another problem with inconsistent dates
left the Stanford Martial Arts Program — and
a number of other groups new to the special
fee process — in a fliering lurch. The online
Flection Handbook claimed that students
could begin fliering Tuesday, April 2, at 12:01

Fhe Flections Commission also promised
to have its handbook posted online March 21.
However, the handbook wasn't finished and
completely updated until Wednesday, April 1.
The election starts luesday, April 10. Fhe
Elections Commission has shown a flagrant
disregard for the students it serves and the
candidates w ho have worked so hard to cam
paign in this election.
