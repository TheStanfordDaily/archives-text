of being alive, the essent e of tbrill.

students who worship
speed. Filmmakers are "(-one in (>0 Sec

Speed is now a multimillion doll.tr hnsi
ness. It's hit the big time; it's tolling m
dough; it's t oi pot ate lantas\. I'm not talking
about white ( rvstalline substani es here. I'm
t.liking about corporate speed. Healing the
market means mo\ ing laster than the com
petition. and this requires optimizing tna
< hines and processes. It means streamlining
organizational structures. In other words,
speed means STO.OOO-a-veai consult.mts
and loads ol inone\ lot Mckinsev.
Slowness, in contrast, is death. While the
quick-witted are the lile ol parties, the slow
are elums\ and dull. I he French speak ol !*'

I .ike the difference between biking and
walking. Stanford students like to bike (or
rollerblade. 01 skateboard, or hop on .1
scooter) because it's infiniteh fastei than
walking. It lets vou sleep for that extra five
minutes in the morning. Nobod\ under

biking, I was accused of attempting "grad

As if that even exists.
Walking makes the campus come alive
with the past. Ueisurch stroll stirs memories
of l iisbeegolf.it White Pla/.a, rock clinilKTs
on the walls of the Main Quad and that sur
real moment two vears ago when 1 sudden
l\ realized that a giant papier-mache sculp
ture of the blue-skinned Japanese cartoon
charactet Doraemon had replaced Rodin's
rhinker.
If I want to run awa\ from memories,
however, I bike. It makes me live in the mo
ment, 01 else risk a bike accident. I hings
around me, what happened pist now, the)
don't matter — I just need to get to class.
Speed is appealing Ixcause forget fulness is
sometimes verv welcome.
I .ike a less pedestrian example. Love is
quick. It arrives and departs with a look 01 a
toiu h, in a moment that refuses to acknowl
edge the sequencing of thought or action.
Ihe quickness ot love explains win men
cringe whcncvci women ask. "So when ex
.ll tl\ did \oti fall in love with me?"
It happened so fast, we can't rcmcml>er.
We can't remember l.indom hook-ups
either, for the same reason.
In contrast, the actual process of love, the
pursuing and the Ix-ing pursued, is endless
waiting and constant anticipation. It is lan
guorous. slow, almost still. So we rcincmlxT
the series of dates, the many instances of in
tiin.u \ or quarrel, the falling in love and get
ting over breakups, but never the exact light
ning moment of love or hate.
We worship sjx'ed because its centrifugal
at tion detaches us from the past. But against
the cult of speed-worship stands the value of
slowness as remembrance. After all. I'll
damn well rctnemfxT the Post Office when
I'm through with Stanford.
