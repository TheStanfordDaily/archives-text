# ASSU fliering confusion turns costly for some fee campaigns
## Conflicting fliering start times may place some groups in jeopardy 
### ERIK WONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Campaign paraphenaha is
evervwhere these davs, but some
campaigns have eflectiveh lost the
chance to post their fliers, posters
and banners in public spaces. In
addition, as of last night, some
groups fined financial repercus
sions from posting llieis outside
designated areas.

Because of an error on the
ASM Web siic, a handful of spe
(ial tee groups and any number of
slates and ASSI candidates did
not begin posting campaign mate
rials around campus until 12:01
a.m. on I'uesdav, April 3. Many
other campaigns, however, had al
readv posted fliers at various pub
lic locations around campus, some
asearh as 12:01 a.m. on Monday.
According to Jell Lee, assistant
elections commissioner of the
ASSI', the online version of the
(Campaign Practice ('.ode said cam
paigning could ofliciallv begin
"Tuesda\, April 2. at 12:01 a.m."
I hose groups who waited to

post fliers were forced to place
their materials on peripheral sur

the areas designated for campaign

to remove their fliers, but main

Campaign paraphenaha is
evervwhere these davs, but some
campaigns have eflectiveh lost the
chance to post their fliers, posters
and banners in public spaces. In
addition, as of last night, some
groups fined financial repercus
sions from posting llieis outside
designated areas.

Because of an error on the
ASM Web siic, a handful of spe
(ial tee groups and any number of
slates and ASSI candidates did
not begin posting campaign mate
rials around campus until 12:01
a.m. on I'uesdav, April 3. Many
other campaigns, however, had al
readv posted fliers at various pub
lic locations around campus, some
asearh as 12:01 a.m. on Monday.
According to Jell Lee, assistant
elections commissioner of the
ASSI', the online version of the
(Campaign Practice ('.ode said cam
paigning could ofliciallv begin
"Tuesda\, April 2. at 12:01 a.m."
I hose groups who waited to

post fliers were forced to place
their materials on peripheral sur
faces, most of which were outside
the areas designated for campaign
flic-l ing. These groups were asked
to remove their fliers, but main
were not able or chose not to com
ply in time.
"Unfortunately, not all fliers on
top of the wall surrounding the

Thursday,'' w rote ASSI Flections
C-ommisioner Joe Narens in .m e
