Student speaks about
Honor Code violations
1 want to congratulate I lit' l>ail\ and the
()flitf«>t |iiciii ial Alfaii s tor their collabora
!i\t- effort to educate the Stanford commu
nit\ about the Honor (.ode and the Sin
dent |udicial Charter of 1997. 1 hope these
colnmns will encourage students and taeul
t\ to engage in dialogue about the Honor
(.ode and academic integrity. One reeent
example of stub a dialogue between stu
dents and faculty centered on the issue of
plagiarism. Mam people believe that pla
giarism is an intentional act on the part of
the student. 1 his is not always the case. In
fact. I think readers would be surprised at
how manv students use what they term
their "careless" or "sloppy scholarship" as a
defense to contest an alleged Honor Code
violation. One such student has coura
geously written this storv for publication so
others mav learn and Innefit from their
painful experience. The storv begins:
Every senior savs that he or she has the
so-called "senioritis" disease to some de
gree. For those who are not familiar with
the word, senioritis is the state of relaxed se
niors who are dose to graduating and done
with a lot — if not all — of the require
ments for their majors and have some plans
tor their future. These seniors often pro
crastinate and care less about their grades.
1 was one of those seniors. I had secured a
job and I was finishing up my dual degree
in taking units in the last quarter of my
senior year. Despite this course load, 1 was

also trying to make the most of mv last quar
ter at Stanford. 1 was trying to hang out
with mv friends, whom 1 knew 1 would not
see fora long time, if ever.
As yon can see, classes weren't mv first
priority. 1 was cramming tor my assign
ments and problem si ts. However, 1 did
enough work to get mvselt a B or a Bin
classes in mv last quarter of Stanford. 1 was
taking a class that would complete the
Writing in the Major requirement for one
of tin majors. I or this class, students had to
write a paper as the final project and the
whole quartet was spent preparing this
paper. 1 had to write two drafts for this
paper and then the final paper itself. 1 low
ever, I only wrote one draft Ixrause 1 was
sii k at the time the second one was due and
the professor told me that the final draft
deadline was the only important one and
the drafts were tor us to get feedback from
the professor and the FA.
It was reallv late when I stalled writing
the paper. And as Dead Day and finals
week approached, 1 saw that 1 was much
more behind inclassesthan 1 thought 1 was.
All the assignments were taking a lot of
time, and I started to sleep very little and
tried to finish everything on time. I started
the paper the day before it was due and I
wrote it basically all night and dav until 9
p.m. on the davit was due. My first draft
was a bad one and 1 knew it would get a bad
grade. In the feedback letter of the profes
sor. he told me to fix a lot of things. So 1 de
cided to change the structure of the paper
substantially and make it much better.
1 wrote it for 10 straight hours and 1 had

to stop writing and start doing the final
wrap-up. Footnotes have been one of the
last things that 1 do in a paper during mv
vears at Stanford, and the reason is that
they distract mv train of thought when 1 do
them in the middle of writing the paper. So,
as always, I had to write the footnotes, but
this time I was too late and I only did them
in 10 to 15 minutes. But there were so main
that 1 had to footnote and 1 really did not
want to hide anything. So 1 put a footnote
m the subtitles and wrote at the bottom of
the page that the subsection was compiled
from such and such sources. 1 just wanted
to make sure everything was there, but 1
did not have the time to mark the exact
quotes in the proper way.
Because I did not actually try to claim
that the information was not mv product. I
wrote all the sources I used while writing
the paper in the bibliography section. 1
handed in the paper around MO p.m. and
started to study tor mv final the next dav.
And the next couple of days went by quick
ly. 1 finished my last finals at Stanford and
started preparing for the arrival of m\ par
ents the next dav and the senior dinner on
the Quad.
Just as I was getting dressed for the se
nior dinner, happy that my finals were
over, 1 received an e-mail from my Writing
in the Major professor telling me that they
found some undocumented material in my
paper and they had contacted the Judicial
Office about plagiarism in my paper.
When I read this e-mail, 1 was disturbed.
but I was not that scared because 1 knew
that it would probably be resolved soon, be
cause I wrote .ill the sources in the bibliog
raphy section and I did not trv to hide any
thing. I tell that im doing a bad job on the
documentation would not get me to the |u
dit ial ( Mlice. but would rather end up with
a reduction in m\ grade. After all. this was
not .in ethical mistake.
However, the next few days were |ust a
real nightmare. I was charged with plagia
rism and there was a panel hearing. I he
dav ni\ parents arrived .it Stanford, I went
to get them from the airport and started
crying when 1 saw them, l liev first thought
I was crying because I missed them so
much, but then 1 told them the whole storv.
()f course, thev were shocked, upset, frus
trated and. most of all, sad to see me ci \ ing
like that.
I he hearing was going to be the next
morning. 1 li.it night, 1 sat up with m\ fa
ther and wrote a statement to defend mv
selt. saving that I did not try to hide .un
tiling. ()n tlie contrary. 1 tried to make suie
all the sources I used in \vt iting the paper
were there, even though tlicv were not cor
rectly documented within the paper. That
was the way that the professoi and the I A
found the undcx umented part. Why would
I write the name of the source it I was real
ly trying to hide the source and commit
plagiarism? I hat made no sense, and I
thought tliey would understand that, too.
M\ most important defense yvas that I
would not have any motivation at all to
commit plagiai ism. I he parts that were not
documented were actually some facts that I

would not have known bv myself without
reading from some source. They were not
ideas, they yvere only facts. .Also, I don't
think documenting those parts would have
changed mv final grade in the c lass, which
would have Ix-en a B had there been no
plagiarism.
1 he biggest problem was that the first
draft to this assignment contained much
bigger undocumented parts. The reason
was that 1 thought the draft would only be a
"draft," showing the professor how I would
organi/e the paper. And 1 had not even in
cluded .i bibliography in that one.
So, the next dav, I appeared before the
panel with the judicial offic er and the ad
viser, as well as mv parents. The panel
found me guilt\ and punished me with I JO
hours of community service, as well as a
quarter's delay of my diploma. I he panel's
rationale was that they thought 1 was not
malicious in doing this, but that I was re
sponsible for not taking the necessary care
to d(H unient all sources properly. So while
the standard punishment is a 'J-quarter
delay in the conferral of degree and 40
hours of community service, the panel gave
me halt of that.
l lus yvas dangerous tor me because 1 was
going to start a job in August and I did not
know whether the company would .isk for
m\ diploma. 1 was anxious about that and
sad, of course, to be found guilty of some
thing only bee ause of c arclessncss. pioc ras
tination and maybe not caring enough
about this class or my grade.
I Icmever. the big hit came when the pro
fessor decided to give inea"\ot Passed" tor
the class. 1 Ins meant that I would not be
able to complete the requirements tor my
second major and would not be able to
graduate with a dual degree. 1 changed im
dual degree to .i single one with a minor in
the degree I lost.

1 also learned that once a degree was
conferred, there was no way to come back to
Stanford and take the remaining class again
and switch the minor into a major. So there
1 was, thinking about the other 12 classes
t li»it 1 took tor my second major and losing
that degree with this mistake. In addition to
this. 1 learned that Stanford prints diplo
mas only twice a year and I would be able to
get my diploma only in December, so there
would be a 6-month delay. 1 am just pray
ing that the company that 1 work tor will not
ask tor my diploma.
One ot the other problems is that, dur
ing the interviews, 1 told the panel that 1 was
expecting a dual degree in June 2000. But
my diploma will only show one degree and
it will be dated August 2000. 1 tow will 1 ex
plain this to the company? It is easy to ex
plain yourself to people who already know
you, but the company will not understand
or take a risk with a person who is punished
In the panel at Stanford.
1 learned that 1 have to be extremeh
careful when 1 am dcxumenting sources
that 1 use in a project and that 1 should not
procrastinate.
1 wrote this letter to warn you against
procrastination and not caring about a
papei and documentation. M\ professor's
intention in punishing me so severely was
parth to teac li me a lesson, but also to set an
example before others. His words were:
"Plagiarism is the cardinal sin someone can
commit in an academic environment. Pla
giarism is hard to check, and probabh de
tected insuttic ienth often. Therefore, in
c ases where it is detected, the consequences
must be severe in order to deter others in
the future."
I o other students: 1 .ook oyer and over
and do a perfect job of documenting
sources whenever you use an outside
soni c c\ ()nc e a crime is committed, your in

tentions will not save you from being pun
ished. You might not have intended to
commit the crime, but that w ill onl\ lighten
your punishment, it that. It will not get von
out of the court with a "not giult\" label be
cause vou will be guilty.
Don't think this will not happen to vou. I
was a student with ultimate respect tor the
1 lonor ('.ode. I have never st raved from the
truth or mv personal ethic al values, both in
my academic life and in in\ personal lite. I
learned that it can happen. I hope nobod\
else lives through the kind ot davs I li\eel
through and that this letter reminds vou to
be careful.

As we start the new quarter, this student's
story reminds us to be thoughtful and topa\
close attention todetail in completing.ill ac a

and dialogue will help us .is .i eommunitx
