Student speaks about
Honor Code violations
1 want to congratulate I lit' l>ail\ and the
()flitf«>t |iiciii ial Alfaii s tor their collabora
!i\t- effort to educate the Stanford commu
nit\ about the Honor (.ode and the Sin
dent |udicial Charter of 1997. 1 hope these
colnmns will encourage students and taeul
t\ to engage in dialogue about the Honor
(.ode and academic integrity. One reeent
example of stub a dialogue between stu
dents and faculty centered on the issue of
plagiarism. Mam people believe that pla
giarism is an intentional act on the part of
the student. 1 his is not always the case. In
fact. I think readers would be surprised at
how manv students use what they term
their "careless" or "sloppy scholarship" as a
defense to contest an alleged Honor Code
violation. One such student has coura
geously written this storv for publication so
others mav learn and Innefit from their
painful experience. The storv begins:
Every senior savs that he or she has the
so-called "senioritis" disease to some de
gree. For those who are not familiar with
the word, senioritis is the state of relaxed se
niors who are dose to graduating and done
with a lot — if not all — of the require
ments for their majors and have some plans
tor their future. These seniors often pro
crastinate and care less about their grades.
1 was one of those seniors. I had secured a
job and I was finishing up my dual degree
in taking units in the last quarter of my
senior year. Despite this course load, 1 was

also trying to make the most of mv last quar
ter at Stanford. 1 was trying to hang out
with mv friends, whom 1 knew 1 would not
see fora long time, if ever.
As yon can see, classes weren't mv first
priority. 1 was cramming tor my assign
ments and problem si ts. However, 1 did
enough work to get mvselt a B or a Bin
classes in mv last quarter of Stanford. 1 was
taking a class that would complete the
Writing in the Major requirement for one
of tin majors. I or this class, students had to
write a paper as the final project and the
whole quartet was spent preparing this
paper. 1 had to write two drafts for this
paper and then the final paper itself. 1 low
ever, I only wrote one draft Ixrause 1 was
sii k at the time the second one was due and
the professor told me that the final draft
deadline was the only important one and
the drafts were tor us to get feedback from
the professor and the FA.
It was reallv late when I stalled writing
the paper. And as Dead Day and finals
week approached, 1 saw that 1 was much
more behind inclassesthan 1 thought 1 was.
All the assignments were taking a lot of
time, and I started to sleep very little and
tried to finish everything on time. I started
the paper the day before it was due and I
wrote it basically all night and dav until 9
p.m. on the davit was due. My first draft
was a bad one and 1 knew it would get a bad
grade. In the feedback letter of the profes
sor. he told me to fix a lot of things. So 1 de
cided to change the structure of the paper
substantially and make it much better.
1 wrote it for 10 straight hours and 1 had

to stop writing and start doing the final
wrap-up. Footnotes have been one of the
last things that 1 do in a paper during mv
vears at Stanford, and the reason is that
they distract mv train of thought when 1 do
them in the middle of writing the paper. So,
as always, I had to write the footnotes, but
this time I was too late and I only did them
in 10 to 15 minutes. But there were so main
that 1 had to footnote and 1 really did not
want to hide anything. So 1 put a footnote
m the subtitles and wrote at the bottom of
the page that the subsection was compiled
from such and such sources. 1 just wanted
to make sure everything was there, but 1
did not have the time to mark the exact
quotes in the proper way.
Because I did not actually try to claim
that the information was not mv product. I
wrote all the sources I used while writing
the paper in the bibliography section. 1
handed in the paper around MO p.m. and
started to study tor mv final the next dav.
And the next couple of days went by quick
ly. 1 finished my last finals at Stanford and
started preparing for the arrival of m\ par
ents the next dav and the senior dinner on
the Quad.
Just as I was getting dressed for the se
nior dinner, happy that my finals were
over, 1 received an e-mail from my Writing
in the Major professor telling me that they
found some undocumented material in my
paper and they had contacted the Judicial
Office about plagiarism in my paper.
When I read this e-mail, 1 was disturbed.
