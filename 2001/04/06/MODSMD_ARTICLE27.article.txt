Sophomore |amie ( are\, the 2000
Pacific 10 Conference Freshman
ot the Year and single-season '.\-
point record holder, was attached
to neai 1\ even blurb written about
the Stanford women's basketball
team.
Not onl\ was the team pit ki d to
finish at the top ol the contemn e.
but boosters were even making al
lusions to the strong Stanford
NC.AA tournament teams from a
few \eais bat k.
Vnd then came disaster No. 1.
|list davs before the Stanford
women were slated to kick off their
season, ('.arev tearfulh announced
she was fort ed to retire from colle
giate basketball because of recur
rent concussions. While iinqucs
tiouabh the best pure shooter on
the team. (lare\ was also slated to
be a floor leader this season.
Suddenly, freshman Susan
King was pushed into the job.
King, a highh touted guard re
cruit, wasn't new to the point
guard position. After a few grow
ing pains in carl\ games, ('ardinal

tans reali/ecl that, despite some
new faces on the floor, Stanford
still bad a shot at making a detent
i tin this season.
I lowever. disaster sti nt k again.
| usi over a week aftet King's huge
21-point performance in I en
nessee, in which the freshman
nearh letl her team to .i heralded
upset of the Lath Volunteers,
Stanford lost its second point
guard. When King fell to the floor
in the ()klahoma game, shattering
her anterior ( rut iate ligament and
relegating hei to the sidelines for
the remainder of the season, the
wondering truh began.
With ( are\ out and King down,
head coach lata VanDerveer
(ailed upon (>-foot-2 freshman
Nicole Powell to take the helm.
And while nobody questioned
Powell's undeniable basketball tal
ent. the Phoenix native, who had
plavetl center in high school, was
far from familiar with the role of
flooi leader.
I he next six games s.iw a dismal
2-1 record, including an un
pi ecendented 1 -'t opening ret ord
in Pat-10 plav. After the Oregon
St.ite Oregon road trip which
not onh saw .1 pair of losses, but
also an unbelievable Mi turnovers
over the course of two games —
the team was read\ tot lit its losses,
salvage what it could of the season
and wait for the return of King
and some new guard recruits next
vear.
However, while things looked
bleak, the conference season was
still in its infancy, and, even
though the team had a much dif
ferent look to it, the objective re
mained the same.
()thci plavers, like junior Knjoli
1/idor, stepped up to help relieve
Powell of some of the point guard
duties. Senior Sarah Oimson was
the defensive leader for the (-arcli
nal and was given the tough task of
guarding opponents' toughest
and quickest guards. In addition,
junior landsev Yamasaki, who had
missed nearlv half Of her sopho
more season because of her
tenure on the national-runner-up
volleyball team, returned to bas
ketball full-time. 11 v midseason,
she seemed to find the scoring
groove that had made a huge im-

pact during her freshman cam- *
paign. s
Slowly but surely, the Cardinal \
began to disguise its weaknesses, t
While Stanford's lack of a true
guard was a red flag for teams to
increase their defensive pressure, <
it also gave Stanford the added ad- <
vantage of being able to post up at \
every position. c
After what looked like an unsal- 1
vageable beginning, the Cardinal
won seven straight and.due to the t
topsy-turvy conference race, I
found itself back in the top realm 1
of the Pac-10 standings. However, t
just when things were beginning
to look up, narrow home losses to (
California and Southern Califor- 112
nia and .1 tight road loss to Wash- ;
ington left Stanford looking at >
third place in the final conference t
standings heading into the final |
weekend of play down at Arizona 1
and Arizona State.
And that's when things finally
started to turn Stanford's way. \
After the ups and downs of the 1
rollercoastcr season, the Cardinal 1
women finally came out right <
where the critics had placed them: >
on top of the Pac-10 standings. Be- 1
hind a superb homecoming week- t
end from Powell, Stanford record- I
ed wins over both the Sun Devils i

and ilic Wildcats and finished the
season as co-Pat-10 champions
with Arizona State and Washing
ton and with an automatic NCAA
Tournament bid.
"()f .ill our Pac-10 (Champi
onships, this might he the sweetest
one," VanDerveer said after the
win. "...the parity in the confer
ence has been really good and has
brought out a lot of excitement."
While the weekend's momen
tum left Stanford wishing fora
higher seed than the 10 it re
ceived in the West Region, the
team breezed through its opening
— round game over No. 7
George Washington. While all
signs pointed to a close game
against No. 2 Oklahoma, a ner
vous and tight Stanford squad
took the floor. Despite several op
portunities to pull ahead, the
team ended its season in a 67-50
loss in Norman.
The Cardinal is forced to say
goodbye to Dimson and fellow se
nior Carolyn Moos, but the squad
is in good hands for the 112 uture. The
extra pressures plac ed on this years
squad by injuries gave players only
more experience and comfort on
the court. And, as the Cardinal
looks to next year's season, nobcxly
is questioning its lack of talent.
