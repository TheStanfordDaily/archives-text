Freshman Brenda Villa, shown here in a win over San Jose State earlier this season, garnered conference Player of
the Week honors this week The undefeated women's water polo squad faces No. 2 UCLA today
the s(|ii.ids will both have defeat
ed every team in the MPSF ex
cept each other. Therefore, the
match on Friday will determine
the No. 1 seed in the MPSF
('.ham pi on ship Tournament,
held at the end of April in I fawaii.
I lie tournament seeding is
crucial in regards to the newly
initiated NCAA Tournament at
the end of the season. I lu- format
of the NCAAs allows only four
teams to qualifv, with one of the
bids going to the winner of the
MPSF tournament. Two other
bids go to conference winners

from other regions, and the last
spot is given to an at-large team.
Should Stanford lose the MPSF
tournament, the Cardinal is still
in a good position to receive the
at-large NCAA bid, but is only
guaranteed a bid by winning the
tournament.
According to Tanner, getting
the No. 1 MPSF seed "will mean
an easier first-round game and,
theoretically, if the tournament
follows seeding, mean .in easier
semi-final game as well. Overall,
the No. 1 seed makes for an easi
er path to the championship."
After today's crucial match,
the squad will face Loyola Mary
mount in a non-conference
match tomorrow night at Avery
Aquatics Center. "Fhe Lions are

i ranked ninth in the country and
will travel to the Bay Area fora
three-game road trip to put their
1 12-1 record on the line. They are
currently the favorite to win the
> Western Water Polo Association
Championship, which would
grant them a bid to the NCAA
* Tournament.
1 This weekend will be a good
indication of the Cardinal's
t strength as it approaches the
i postseason. "We just need to
come out from the beginning,
like we did last time," Villa said.
"It we can score the first couple of
goals, they're a really emotional
team. We know they're going to
be really pumped up. This could
take away the No. 1 seeding at
MPSF."
