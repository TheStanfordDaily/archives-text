service, Hart entreated the mem
bers of the audience to improve
their communities, saving, "Most
young people . . . have the de

their countrv," but they need the
national government to create
programs for them to accomplish
this goal.

ment of the Peace Corps in 1961
and (Clinton's founding of Ameri
corps in 1992, Hart pointed out
