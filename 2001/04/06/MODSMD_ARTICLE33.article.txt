# Injuries plague Cardinal volleyball
## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN STAFF WRITER 
With just tour games left in the regular sea
son. the most important name on the Stanford
men's volleyball team roster is probably Mark
Snow.
Snow hasn't played in any matches this year,
but, as the team's athletic trainer, he has had
more work to do this season than anyone on the
injury-plagued Cardinal squad ever could have
imagined at the beginning of the vear.
No. 5 Stanford (11-7, 7-ti Mountain Pacific
Spoils Federation) hopes to start its best lineup
tins weekend for onl\ the second time since
earl\ February, but injuries to ke\ plavers ma\
jeopardize those plans.
Flic Cardinal looks to snap a three-match
losing streak tonight when it hosts No. S I C-
Santa Barbara (1 1-9. 1-9) at 7 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion. Stanford returns to Maples tomorrow
at 7 p.m. to face No. IS Cal State-Northridge
(1 1-12, 3-10).
"(her the last eight weeks, the lineup has
had to almost constant 1\ change out of nei essi
t\ with all the injuries we've had." head coach
Ruben Nieves s.iid. "It's a constant battle to set
our standard of plav in practice that we're
going to earn ovei to the game. We've got to
take die plav ers we've got v\ ho are healthy and
let them plav together as mix h as we can."
Stanford's injury problems were apparent
earlier tins week, v\iien No. 2 Brigham Young
swept the short-handed Cardinal on Mondav

and I uesday nights.
Sophomore outside hitter Curt Foppel, sec -
ond in the MPSF with 5.50 kills per game, re
turned to the lineup Monday after missing the
Cardinal's previous three matches.
But the team played without junior outside
hitter Marcus Skacel, whose 117 digs on the
season lead the squad. Skacel injured his t< m>t in
practice on Sunday. Then Stanford lost red
shirt sophomore Setli King, one of the Cardi
nal's primary passers, to an ankle injury late in
Monday's match.
Skacel, who was expected to miss at least
three weeks, surprised everyone bv playing at
libero on Tuesday, and there are high hopes
that he will be able to return to his usual outside
hitter spot tonight. King did not practice ves
terdav. but there is a c hance he could return to
the libero position for tonight's match against
the (iauchos.
It Ring and Skacel are cleared to plav, Stan
ford will send its top lineup to the floor tor the
first time since it defeated then-No. 2 IJCIA, 3-
2, on Mat ch 9.
"We had to go back to the drawing board to
figure out how best todeal with the hands we've
been plaved a lot recently," Nieves said. "It's
frustrating, but injuries are a matter of luck,
and luck is an important part ol sports."
Stanford is just one win awav from i line hing
one of the two remaining spots in the MPSF
tournament, as BYU, l'CL\, Hawaii, Long
Beach State, Southern California and IVpper
dine have already sealed positions in the eight

team tournament.
Both of the Cardinal's opponents this week
end are also in contention for the final two play
off berths.
After starting the season strong, Santa Bar
bara has struggled offensively during confer
ence plav, ranking ninth in the 12-team con
ference in team hitting percentage with a .293
mark.
Stanford defeated the then-No. 2 Cauchos,
3-1. in Santa Barbara on Jan. 27. as Skat el post
ed a double-double with 20 kills and 10 digs.
Toppel tallied 10 kills for the Cardinal, which
hit .434 in the match, while the Ciauchos were
led by outside hitters Ben Koski and Andy
Rivera, who each pic ked up 10 kills.
Northridge ranks near the bottom of the
MPSF in just about every statistical category,
but, with wins in its final four conference
matches, the Matadors could sneak into the
playoffs.
Junior outside hitter Kckhard Walter is
Northridge's most serious weapon, with 4.05
kills per game and an MPSF-high 51 service
.ices on the season.
The (Cardinal crushed the Matadors, 3-0, on
Jan. 20, outhitting Northridge .538 to .170 in
the process.
"Both these teams are good and are very ca
pable of playing great volleyball, and they'll
both be looking to avenge their losses to us ear
lier in the season," said sophomore outside hit
ter Billy Strickland. "We need to go out there
and play our game the whole time."
