According to general manager Marvin Ro
driguc/. one-third of the establishment's revenue
has been lost to competition, primarily Jamba [nice
and I he I reehouse, wliich are housed in I residder
I nion along with Bon Appetit Cafe. Asa result, the
management has felt severe pressure to cut costs in
order to stav in business.
I lalf an bout was cut from the workday of MO per
cent of all cafe employees. According to Rodriguez,
the management dec ided to subject the majority of
employees to this same s( hedule change iu the spirit
of fairness.
Danielle M.thone/, work-site organizing direc tor
for the Service Kmployees International Union
chapter that oversees the I niversitv and Santa ( .lat a
College, disagreed, saving that the changes made

have not been at all fair. In particular, she cites a con

Late last week, Rodriguez informed Malta
Ramirez, who is now on a leave of absence and cur

According to Rodriguez, the new schedule was post
ed on Thursday; Ramirez announced on Friday that
the changes violated the contract, but that the union
