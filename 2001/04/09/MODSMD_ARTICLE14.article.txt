()n April 9, 1990, The Daily printed .111
article about Muwekma-Tah-Ruk.
"Residents ot the American Indian
1 heme 1 louse, formerh known as Lathrop
I louse, oilit iallv renamed their home in the
()hlone Indian language as Muwekma-lah-
Ruk .it .1 program Saturday.
"Resident assistant Colin Hainpson, who
was master of ceremonies .it the program,
s.iid the name change was 'exciting tor the
house and the community.
"Hainpson said residents have wanted to
change the name ever since Latlnop be
came the American Indian I heine House.
' I he time was right,' he said, 'to honor the
people who had lived on this land' before
the I 'nivcrsity was built.
"1 lampson said members ol the ()hlone
coinmunit\ acquainted residents with the
tribe's history, ( ulture and language. 1 he
tribe membei s advised the residents to form
their own ( oikept ot what the house meant
to them betbre choosing a new name."
Bottom line: Wonder if the residents of 553
Mayfield put as much thought into renaming
their house "Mars?"
