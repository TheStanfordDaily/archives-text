face a host of problems— including
lack of housing, childcare, stipends,
health care and parking — tli.it re
quire immediate attention from Ix>lli the I niver
sitv and the (iraduate Student Council. As the
group responsible lor representing graduate stu
dents' interests in l Diversity decisions, the (iSC!
has shown little suit ess toward addressing t< >pical
issues this year. With ASM electionsonh twoda\ s
awav, and only four candidates running for l f>
(iS( 1 positions, it's time to re-evaluate the role of
the council and question the el let tivenessof sepa
rate bodies for untleigraduale and graduate stu
dent representation.
l he GSC.'s stated mission is to voice student
concerns at the administrative level, address
problems affecting graduate students and plan
s(k ial events to unifv the diverse graduate com
munity. Hut, since separating fioin the ASS I I n-

dergraduate Senate in IW, the (.S( lias not
made great strides in at hieving its goals, especial
ly considering that ilic spin was motivated, in part.
In a desire to improve the(tunneling ol graduate
concerns to the I nivei sit\.
()ver the past \ ear. (lie (-S(. has advocated se\ -
eral initiatives: en\ironinentalK Iriendh build
ings, improved parking facilities and better
stipends lot graduate students. Hut the (>S( has
shown a distressing la» k of follow-through in
these initiatixes.
()ne problem is the lat k of general interest
on I lie part of students and (iS( 1 members — in
what the (>S( docs, (iraduate students do not
seem to have enough time to run loi (iSC. ollice
or to vole for representatives, because not
enough candidates run foi the I > positions eat li
year, the previous vear's senators olten recruit
meinbers to sene on the council.
I hat niosi ol I lie (.S( s of fit ei s are not elect

cd In students is ,i glaring example of the inefli
cacv, both perceived and actual, of the council.
()l course, elections lor the (iS( 1 will be funda
mentalh dillerent from elections lot members of
the I ndergraduate Senate because Ihe majorit\
ol graduate students seem less interested in stu
dent government than undergraduates. How
ever, graduate students have just as many, if not
more, pressing problems to resolve. ( >raduate
students are thinking about supporting families
and findingailbrdahlc housing, and their repre
sentation in the decisions ol the I niversit\ s stu
dent lilt' services is \ ital il I hesc situations are to
be improved.
I lie decision-making pnxess of the (iSC. has
also attracted criticism, even from its own mem
be iv (.ui rent l\. decisions are made bv consensus,
w I lie li requires all representatives to agree to a
motion before its passage. Although this method
promotes dialogue and participation, it also para-

Iv/es decision-making antl delays action. Moving
away from consensus to majority rule, for exam
pit'. speeds up the progress on these decisions.
1 lie ASM split has not enhanced the power ol
the (»S(to earn'out directives meaningful to the
graduate student hodv. In fact, an evaluation of
the current state oft lie C.SC reveals the need to
consider new alternatives for ellective graduate
student representation.
Within the current structure, the CiSC must
better communicate with the
Senate on initiatives to improve student life. Un
dergradnates liave more time to devote to student
government and main believe strongly in help
ing to IxMter the situation of many graduate stu
dents. We urge the newest (iSCmembers to eval
uate the council's eflectiveness and make a con
centrated effort to utilize their own political posi
tion and the undergraduate community to make
visible, meaningful improvements next year.
