# JUST A BIT OUTSIDE
## Eule for ASSU Senate 
### 
In honor of tomorrow's ASSl
elections, 1 would like to otlu ial-
Iv declare my < .iihImI.k v foi
ASSL Undergraduate Sen.ite.
Never mind the fact that I didn't fill
out a "declaration of intent" form. ,i>>
required. I may not be on the hallot,
but you can mark, me down .is a write
in candidate.
And never mind the fact that I am
a senior. After some not-so-extensive
research of the election laws on the
ASSl elections' Web site. I see no log

ical reason why a
graduating senior
cannot be elected.
Maybe 1 missed
something, but it
wasn't there. Kven il
it was, vou can still
mark me down .is a
write-in candidate.
I think I have a lot
to otter.

For example, there are lots of
catchy phrases 1 have read\ to put up
on your bathroom stalls. We will start
off with something simple, like .1 pu -
ture of Mr. T. and sav, "Don't be .1
fool, vote for Eule." Then, we can
move to more complicated stuff, like,
"Fast meets West meets North meets
Kule."
As the topper, 1 plan to put up a
sign that says, "Brian Kule — .1 great
name, a great choice." Beneath this,
we could list all the references to m\
name, with which I have absolutely
nothing to do. It'll be great.
Iti fact, one of the first actions I
promise to take as vour senator is to
ensure that catchy phrases like these
are put up in your bathroom stalls, not
just during election week, but all vcar
long. Likewise, 1 plan to be a voic e tor
the students. 1 plan to improve rela
tions between us and them. I plan to
use (lit lies as often as possible.
That's not all. Don't like Wilbur
dining? F.lect me. Don't like to studv?
It's taken care of. Do you want snow at
Stanford? I'll bring it to vou.
But these aren't the main reasons
why I am running tor Senate. No, the
reason I am running, the reason I am
your candidate, is a simple one: auto
matic flushing toilets.
You've seen them before in fancy
restaurants, and even 111 some air
ports. They are beautiful piet es of ma
chinery that know when vou are done
doing your business and proceed to
relieve you of the strenuous burden of

pushing ili.it little lever. Now I sa\ to
vou, ladies and gentlemen of Stan
ford, what is a fine university without
automatii flushing toilet s
-11 s.l utiivei sit\ not worth all the te.i
in China. It's .is useless .is ;i screen
door on <1 submarine. It's»lose, but no
cigar.
Imagine voursclt tired after a long
da\. You sit down, enjoying the pri
vacy of \oiii own stall, taking \oui
time, having a moment to yourself.
When vou finish, \ou stand up and
rcali/c vou must bend down once
again to flush. Elet t me, and llusli no
more. As your senator. I will hike
ayvav this burden. Instead, the sweet
sounds of the autom.itit Hush will sing
thi oughout t anipus.
A few ol my opponents (v\lio shall
remain nameless because there is 110
reason to give them free publicity)
have come up with some interesting
ideas. But let me make it very cleai that
I knew the flushing toilet; the flushing
toilet w as .1 friend of mine, and im op
ponents are no Hushing toilet.
Write me in on your ballot and vou
will be voting for freedom. Write me
111 on your ballot and vou will be Not
ing for modet ni/ation.
1 believe what goes around tomes
around. I believe 111 taking it one day
.it a time. 1 believe every dog has its
day.
I here are 15 spots open tin the
VSSI I ndcrgraduatc Senate, and. by
more of im not-so-extensive research.
1 have tome to the conclusion that,
with a little more than 400 write-in
votes, I yvill be elected to the Senate.
Only 400 of you have to make a stand
in order to have the remainder of
your time at Stanford be flush-free.
lake one for the team. It's better
late than never. Its .ill that and .1 b.ig
of chips.
My qualifications for this job are ir
relevant. But. as you vote over the
next two days, I want you to remem
ber that by writing iu Eule for Senate,
you are making a stand. You are
showing the I niversitv that your
voice must be heard. No more do
nothing senators. No more hidden
agendas. No more manual flushing.
Write in Eule for Senate. Be a part
of the flush-free ticket. It's as Ameri
can as apple pie.

Brian Eule is looking for naming mates
on his flush-free ticket. E-mail him at
