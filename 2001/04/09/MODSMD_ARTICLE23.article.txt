Newton, Villegas evaluate past year,
endorse presidential slate
V VSSl clct lions have .11 rived bearing
.1 plcthoia of presidential and vice presi
dential candidates wing tot vonr support,
we would like to take this oppoiinnit\ to
share some thoughtson student represen
tation at Stanford. I ndet Iving the \ai ions
platforms of these presidential and viee
presidential candidates are assumptions
about what student representation is and
should be. As von attempt to wade
through the issues and principles these
candidates present, we wish to oflei some
insights about how we have approached
"representing" the voice of students.
()ver the p.ist vear as vonr ASSl pres
ident and vice president, we have imple
mented a model that is rooted in two < en
tral oh jet lives: I he first is increasing the
voice of students and accountahilit\ of
the administration in I niversitv deci
sion-making. and the second is treating
empowering structures that allow stu
dents to pursue .1 meaningful Stanford
experience.
I he first aim hinges on bringing stu
dents to the table .it all levels of the I 111-
vei sit\ s det ision-making prot ess. ()nr 111-
volvement with the undergraduate pat ent
community demonstrates a commitment
to this aim. It means being explicit about
which of the manv tables students should
be at. and specifving who will bring whom
to the table. I Tie I niversitv administra
tion has a rcsponsibilitv to be transparent

.md accountable to its students as mem
bers of the Stanford community. It also
means prioritizing issues according to the
most deeply and widely It-It student needs
on ( anipus. while being conscious ol issue
areas and legacies ol under'representa
tion. As such, the current status and future
of our community tenters has been .1 pri
ority for us.
I he second aspiration accepts the idea
that as students are the primary agents 111
treating their own Stanford experience,
the ASSI should be invested in providing
the tools for students to build their experi
ences and our community instead of im
posing its ow 11 limited \ lew ol the Stanlord
experience or community . Our commit
ment to this investment is evidenced in the
ASSI s new program. Student Initiated
Courses. (It is not too late to take a SIC
t lass this quarter.)
Although we were fortunate to have
been involved in introducing it to the
ASSI . it is the breadth of student partici
pation that went into creating and articu
lating this model ol student representa
tion that makes it critically valid. As such, it
would be irresponsible of us not to take a
stance on the next phase ol ASSL leader
ship. Yet. it is important to do so without
abusing our positions. That said, we are
firmly committed to providing a smooth
transition to whichever slate the students
elect.
In reviewing the candidates and slates
lor ASSL president and vice president,
the following characteristics were very im

port.ml: the individuals previous invest
ment iu .jihl action on the issues they talk
about in their platforms; strong know-how
.uul experience when it comes to under
standing both the workings of the ASM
and the administration; and a commit
ment to building upon (w hie h necessitates
an in-depth understanding of) the above
model of student representation. C»iven
these criteria, one slate stood above the
rest.
We urge you to join us in supporting
Matt Brewer and Christine Cordero for
ASSI president and vice president. Along
with the above characteristics and main
concrete ideas. Brewer and (.ordero have
a firm grasp of the opportunities afforded
by and complexities of student represen
tation at Stanford. Among other qualities,
they embody a commitment to the dual
etuis of increasing the strength of the stu
dent voice in I niversitv decision-making
and creating structures that allow students
to define their Stanford experience.
Please, remember to vote this Tuesday
and Wednesday at http: elcctions.stan

Many fliers 'will not change
the election outcome'
I he ASSU Elections Commission feels
that I he Daily's April b article, "Campaign
tliering confusion turns costly tor main tee
requests, exaggerates the scope and
cause of the problem.
While we have apologized and remain
sorrx tor the original contusion, we do not
believe that the tliering misunderstanding
in White Plaza will have an overall effect
on the election outcome. Fliering and
posting banners is onlv one wax to reach
potential voters. Furthermore, because
every candidate, slate and special tee
group posts similar material, titers and
banners are not a unique wav to run a
campaign. Other campaigning methods,
such as giving public speeches, distribut
ing campaign plat tonus or sitnplx meeting
.tnd talking with voters, are mot e ettec tive
because they differentiate one candidate
from the next. It one slate posts tour fliers
to .mother's two fliers, it will not affect the
election result.
Another important issue to recogni/e is
that \\ bite Plaza lias limited spat e, no
matter when groups began to post their
materials. Even it all groups bad begun to
post fliers at the same exa< t time, the walls
of the (.law ton main .md the banner spat e
on the Birdcage would have been tilled up
in minutes. While our mistake com
pounded the problem, the c ampaign start
date does not c hange the fact that not all
groups can post all of their material 111
\\ bite Plaza. I Ins lias alwa\ s been an issue
in ASM elections and is not the fault of
the Flections Commission or I niversitv
policy.
Because of the limited space, we have
encouraged and continue to encourage
campaigns to look into more original wax s
ot campaigning. The Campaign Practices
('.ode allows tor nianx unique wax s to c am
paign, and, to this point, the Flections
( Commission has not see n nianx groups at
tempting to reac li voters through new spa
per ads, town ball meetings, public
speeches or other events. Hopefully, the
groups that feel disadvantaged In our tnis
take will take the opportunity to reach vot
ers in more innovative xvavs. Let's remem
ber that posting fliers and banners in

White Plaza is onlv one, relatively ineffec
tive, wax to campaign. I laving a hundred
fliers on the ( law or havii g none will not
change the election outcome. Reaching
voters on a personal level will.

Commission .11 the; root c>f the problem is
.i series of unjustified and uninfoi nied ac -
c usations. It reflec is .1 fundamental niisuii
derstanding ot the ASSI . the elections
process and the new changes to tins pro

effort to ascertain the truth and we feel it
was an in just u e that it was published with
out contac ting 11s tii st.
Blaming the Flections ( Commission t<»i
the nature ot the campaigning that result
ed from a decision reached bx the (Consti
tutional Counc il is blatantlx incorrect. We
have no constitutional authority and onlx
execute the guidelines of the constitution
and its In-laws regarding campaigning.
I bus. if I he Dailx lias problems with the
wax the constitution directs the election. it
should look to the (Constitutional (Counc il
and the VSSI I ndei graduate Senate and
the (iraduate Student (Council.
Furthermore, the editorial speaks of
previously enforced rules. In the past,
rules that limit freedom of expression
have never been strictly enforced. It is
wrong to suggest that this year's commis
sion lias i hosen todist egarcl previous elec
tion law. Instead, the commission has be
come mote 111 line with the current consti
tution guaranteeing freedom of expres
sion to all candidates and slates. We as
sume that 1 lie Daily is not arguing that we
should limit freedom of speech.
112 he logic of tree speech also applies to
campaign spending limits. I his year, the
Constitutional Council decided that the
ASSI cannot limit the amount ot monex
spent In c andidates. I litis, the de c ision to
not enforce spending limits was nexei in
the hands of the Flections ('.ommission.
()nc phone call from I he Dailx could have
obtained this information and we- feel that
it is a clisseivie e to blame the (Commission.

In addition, 1 he l)ail\ tailed to report in
their editorial that there will be a ballot
measure addressing the issue of i ampaign
spending in future elections.
Regarding the special lees deadlines
.ind dates, the (■ommission sent an e-mail
to even \ olunteer Student ()rganization,
plat ed an ad in I he l)ail\ itself, posted to
all resident assistant lists and had the stall
from Stanford Student Fnterprises tlis
trihute fliers about the informational
meeting in |anuar\ l« »i groups seeking
special tees.
Any responsible group without internal
disorganization would have found it tliffi
t ult to miss this information. We find it
ironic that I lie l)ail\ was one of the
groups that tailed to attend this meeting
and meet most deadlines. Subsequent
deadlines wen* made available in hard
cop\ and online versions, and all groups
had access to .ill contact information.
ASS I President Setli Newton was not
ton I'd to hold .1 meeting to approve bal
lot placement lor groups that did not join
the elet lion propei l\. Instead, his admin
istration's commitment to supporting stu
dent funding was die reason he < hose to
allow exceptions to out deadlines.
Although we are accountable to the
campaigning date problems (and have
since addressed them), the commission
was not able to tompletch update the
I let lions Handbook until April I bet ause
of pending spet ial fee submissions. As dis
missed above, groups int luding 1 lie l)ail\
did not Ibllow out timeline, and, there
fore, we were ni< e enough todela\ posting
the handbook We did this fbi the benefit
<»112 these groups.
I*inallv, the toinnlent about the timing

(1 lections too close loi conitort") atl

Students don't deserve Fiorina
I would like to echo the sentiments ot
other alumni who have expressed their
support otC.arK Fiorina as Commence
ment speaker for this vcar. At the same
time, 1 want to criticize all three groups in
volved iu the current issue—l niversitv
President John I lenness\. the senior class
presidents and the senior (lass student
both. Shame on all of you.
First, I lenncssv: It appears t learthat lie
neither t learb nor adequately communi
cated to the class presidents, the senior
t lass or the Stanford communit\ at large
what the prot ess is tor selecting the speak
er. Ot particular importance is the fact
that, as with speakers past, it ultiinateh is
bis t hoice and bis choice alone. I think he
also should have laid out the broad criteria
he planned to use to determine the speak
er. His conduct in this prot ess suggests a
lat k of consideration for the graduating
class that Fiorina will address. 1 find tins
tondiK t exemplars of a growing trend of
Stanford presidents ignoring the students
who are their customers. Ii became 111-
creasinglv clear with former I'niversitv
President (ierhard ('.asper and appeal s to
be continuing with I lennessv.
I he senior ( lass presidents have done a
disservice to the (lass that elet let! them bv
attempting to absolve themselves from the
selection process entirely. Irrespective of
w bet her Fiorina was on vout top-10 list or
not, von should have learned what the se
lection process was. Ii hasn't changed.
I ranklv, you have no excuse for not hav
ing done your homework.
finally, shame on those in the senior
( lass who feel that Fiorina is not worthy to
be youi ( ommcncement speaker. You eli
tist snobs! You have embarrassed Stan
ford with vour reaction to being lucky
enough to have someone like Fiorina as
your speaker. In addition to being a Stan
ford alumnus. I am also a Hewlett-
Pat kard employee, for the past lour days,
I have had to defend in\ alma mater, and,
in particular, the conduct of the senior
t lass. I lie stutleuts have presented them

selves .ts not w anting Fiorina to be their
Commencement speaker. That she
doesn't rank higlilv enough on their
honor s* .ile to merit this invitation is an
outright joke. No need to go into her qual
ifications.
l.asil\, I would like to share with this se
nioi < lass that the ('.ominencement speak
er lor m\ class was Rolxrt Maynard, pub
lishei of tfie Oakland I rihune (now de
funct). I wonder whether he would have
ranked high enough on the 1111 rent elitist
st ale to wan ant an invitation from this
< l.iss. I .suspect that il he were treated the
\\.i\ the senior c lass has treated Fiorina, he
might have declined the invitation. Part of
me hopes thai Fiorina declines the invita
tion, too. \ 011 don't deserve someone of
hei class.

Many fliers 'will not change
the election outcome'
I he ASSU Elections Commission feels
that I he Daily's April b article, "Campaign
tliering confusion turns costly tor main tee
requests, exaggerates the scope and
cause of the problem.
While we have apologized and remain
sorrx tor the original contusion, we do not
believe that the tliering misunderstanding
in White Plaza will have an overall effect
on the election outcome. Fliering and
posting banners is onlv one wax to reach
potential voters. Furthermore, because
every candidate, slate and special tee
group posts similar material, titers and
banners are not a unique wav to run a
campaign. Other campaigning methods,
such as giving public speeches, distribut
ing campaign plat tonus or sitnplx meeting
.tnd talking with voters, are mot e ettec tive
because they differentiate one candidate
from the next. It one slate posts tour fliers
to .mother's two fliers, it will not affect the
election result.
Another important issue to recogni/e is
that \\ bite Plaza lias limited spat e, no
matter when groups began to post their
materials. Even it all groups bad begun to
post fliers at the same exa< t time, the walls
of the (.law ton main .md the banner spat e
on the Birdcage would have been tilled up
in minutes. While our mistake com
pounded the problem, the c ampaign start
date does not c hange the fact that not all
groups can post all of their material 111
\\ bite Plaza. I Ins lias alwa\ s been an issue
in ASM elections and is not the fault of
the Flections Commission or I niversitv
policy.
Because of the limited space, we have
encouraged and continue to encourage
campaigns to look into more original wax s
ot campaigning. The Campaign Practices
('.ode allows tor nianx unique wax s to c am
paign, and, to this point, the Flections
( Commission has not see n nianx groups at
tempting to reac li voters through new spa
per ads, town ball meetings, public
speeches or other events. Hopefully, the
groups that feel disadvantaged In our tnis
take will take the opportunity to reach vot
ers in more innovative xvavs. Let's remem
ber that posting fliers and banners in

White Plaza is onlv one, relatively ineffec
tive, wax to campaign. I laving a hundred
fliers on the ( law or havii g none will not
change the election outcome. Reaching
voters on a personal level will.

112 he logic of tree speech also applies to
campaign spending limits. I his year, the

it is a clisseivie e to blame the (Commission.

In addition, 1 he l)ail\ tailed to report in

Students don't deserve Fiorina
I would like to echo the sentiments ot
other alumni who have expressed their
support otC.arK Fiorina as Commence
ment speaker for this vcar. At the same
time, 1 want to criticize all three groups in
volved iu the current issue—l niversitv
President John I lenness\. the senior class
presidents and the senior (lass student
both. Shame on all of you.
First, I lenncssv: It appears t learthat lie
neither t learb nor adequately communi
cated to the class presidents, the senior
t lass or the Stanford communit\ at large
what the prot ess is tor selecting the speak
er. Ot particular importance is the fact
that, as with speakers past, it ultiinateh is
bis t hoice and bis choice alone. I think he
also should have laid out the broad criteria
he planned to use to determine the speak
er. His conduct in this prot ess suggests a
lat k of consideration for the graduating
class that Fiorina will address. 1 find tins
tondiK t exemplars of a growing trend of
Stanford presidents ignoring the students
who are their customers. Ii became 111-
creasinglv clear with former I'niversitv
President (ierhard ('.asper and appeal s to
be continuing with I lennessv.
I he senior ( lass presidents have done a
disservice to the (lass that elet let! them bv
attempting to absolve themselves from the
selection process entirely. Irrespective of
w bet her Fiorina was on vout top-10 list or
not, von should have learned what the se
lection process was. Ii hasn't changed.
I ranklv, you have no excuse for not hav
ing done your homework.
finally, shame on those in the senior
( lass who feel that Fiorina is not worthy to
be youi ( ommcncement speaker. You eli
tist snobs! You have embarrassed Stan
ford with vour reaction to being lucky
enough to have someone like Fiorina as
your speaker. In addition to being a Stan
ford alumnus. I am also a Hewlett-
Pat kard employee, for the past lour days,
I have had to defend in\ alma mater, and,
in particular, the conduct of the senior
t lass. I lie stutleuts have presented them

selves .ts not w anting Fiorina to be their
Commencement speaker. That she
doesn't rank higlilv enough on their
honor s* .ile to merit this invitation is an
outright joke. No need to go into her qual
ifications.
l.asil\, I would like to share with this se
nioi < lass that the ('.ominencement speak
er lor m\ class was Rolxrt Maynard, pub
lishei of tfie Oakland I rihune (now de
funct). I wonder whether he would have
ranked high enough on the 1111 rent elitist
st ale to wan ant an invitation from this
< l.iss. I .suspect that il he were treated the
\\.i\ the senior c lass has treated Fiorina, he
might have declined the invitation. Part of

Many fliers 'will not change
the election outcome'
I he ASSU Elections Commission feels
that I he Daily's April b article, "Campaign
tliering confusion turns costly tor main tee
requests, exaggerates the scope and
cause of the problem.
While we have apologized and remain
sorrx tor the original contusion, we do not
believe that the tliering misunderstanding
in White Plaza will have an overall effect
on the election outcome. Fliering and
posting banners is onlv one wax to reach
potential voters. Furthermore, because
every candidate, slate and special tee
group posts similar material, titers and
banners are not a unique wav to run a
campaign. Other campaigning methods,
such as giving public speeches, distribut
ing campaign plat tonus or sitnplx meeting
.tnd talking with voters, are mot e ettec tive
because they differentiate one candidate
from the next. It one slate posts tour fliers
to .mother's two fliers, it will not affect the
election result.
Another important issue to recogni/e is
that \\ bite Plaza lias limited spat e, no
matter when groups began to post their
materials. Even it all groups bad begun to
post fliers at the same exa< t time, the walls
of the (.law ton main .md the banner spat e
on the Birdcage would have been tilled up
in minutes. While our mistake com
pounded the problem, the c ampaign start
date does not c hange the fact that not all
groups can post all of their material 111
\\ bite Plaza. I Ins lias alwa\ s been an issue
in ASM elections and is not the fault of
the Flections Commission or I niversitv
policy.
Because of the limited space, we have
encouraged and continue to encourage
campaigns to look into more original wax s
ot campaigning. The Campaign Practices
('.ode allows tor nianx unique wax s to c am
paign, and, to this point, the Flections
( Commission has not see n nianx groups at
tempting to reac li voters through new spa
per ads, town ball meetings, public
speeches or other events. Hopefully, the
groups that feel disadvantaged In our tnis
take will take the opportunity to reach vot
ers in more innovative xvavs. Let's remem
ber that posting fliers and banners in

White Plaza is onlv one, relatively ineffec
tive, wax to campaign. I laving a hundred
fliers on the ( law or havii g none will not
change the election outcome. Reaching
voters on a personal level will.

Furthermore, the editorial speaks of

rules that limit freedom of expression
have never been strictly enforced. It is

112 he logic of tree speech also applies to
campaign spending limits. I his year, the

not enforce spending limits was nexei in

it is a clisseivie e to blame the (Commission.

In addition, 1 he l)ail\ tailed to report in

Students don't deserve Fiorina
I would like to echo the sentiments ot
other alumni who have expressed their
support otC.arK Fiorina as Commence
ment speaker for this vcar. At the same
time, 1 want to criticize all three groups in
volved iu the current issue—l niversitv
President John I lenness\. the senior class
presidents and the senior (lass student
both. Shame on all of you.
First, I lenncssv: It appears t learthat lie
neither t learb nor adequately communi
cated to the class presidents, the senior
t lass or the Stanford communit\ at large
what the prot ess is tor selecting the speak
er. Ot particular importance is the fact
that, as with speakers past, it ultiinateh is
bis t hoice and bis choice alone. I think he
also should have laid out the broad criteria
he planned to use to determine the speak
er. His conduct in this prot ess suggests a
lat k of consideration for the graduating
class that Fiorina will address. 1 find tins
tondiK t exemplars of a growing trend of
Stanford presidents ignoring the students
who are their customers. Ii became 111-
creasinglv clear with former I'niversitv
President (ierhard ('.asper and appeal s to
be continuing with I lennessv.
I he senior ( lass presidents have done a
disservice to the (lass that elet let! them bv
attempting to absolve themselves from the
selection process entirely. Irrespective of
w bet her Fiorina was on vout top-10 list or
not, von should have learned what the se
lection process was. Ii hasn't changed.
I ranklv, you have no excuse for not hav
ing done your homework.
finally, shame on those in the senior
( lass who feel that Fiorina is not worthy to
be youi ( ommcncement speaker. You eli
tist snobs! You have embarrassed Stan
ford with vour reaction to being lucky
enough to have someone like Fiorina as
your speaker. In addition to being a Stan
ford alumnus. I am also a Hewlett-
Pat kard employee, for the past lour days,
I have had to defend in\ alma mater, and,
in particular, the conduct of the senior
t lass. I lie stutleuts have presented them

selves .ts not w anting Fiorina to be their
Commencement speaker. That she
doesn't rank higlilv enough on their
honor s* .ile to merit this invitation is an
outright joke. No need to go into her qual
ifications.
l.asil\, I would like to share with this se
nioi < lass that the ('.ominencement speak
er lor m\ class was Rolxrt Maynard, pub
lishei of tfie Oakland I rihune (now de
funct). I wonder whether he would have
ranked high enough on the 1111 rent elitist
st ale to wan ant an invitation from this
< l.iss. I .suspect that il he were treated the
\\.i\ the senior c lass has treated Fiorina, he
might have declined the invitation. Part of

lor ASSL president and vice president,
the following characteristics were very im

port.ml: the individuals previous invest
ment iu .jihl action on the issues they talk
about in their platforms; strong know-how
.uul experience when it comes to under
standing both the workings of the ASM
and the administration; and a commit
ment to building upon (w hie h necessitates
an in-depth understanding of) the above
model of student representation. C»iven
these criteria, one slate stood above the
rest.
We urge you to join us in supporting
Matt Brewer and Christine Cordero for
ASSI president and vice president. Along
with the above characteristics and main
concrete ideas. Brewer and (.ordero have
a firm grasp of the opportunities afforded
by and complexities of student represen
tation at Stanford. Among other qualities,
they embody a commitment to the dual
etuis of increasing the strength of the stu
dent voice in I niversitv decision-making
and creating structures that allow students
to define their Stanford experience.
Please, remember to vote this Tuesday
and Wednesday at http: elcctions.stan

Many fliers 'will not change
the election outcome'
I he ASSU Elections Commission feels
that I he Daily's April b article, "Campaign
tliering confusion turns costly tor main tee
requests, exaggerates the scope and
cause of the problem.
While we have apologized and remain
sorrx tor the original contusion, we do not
believe that the tliering misunderstanding
in White Plaza will have an overall effect
on the election outcome. Fliering and
posting banners is onlv one wax to reach
potential voters. Furthermore, because
every candidate, slate and special tee
group posts similar material, titers and
banners are not a unique wav to run a
campaign. Other campaigning methods,
such as giving public speeches, distribut
ing campaign plat tonus or sitnplx meeting
.tnd talking with voters, are mot e ettec tive
because they differentiate one candidate
from the next. It one slate posts tour fliers
to .mother's two fliers, it will not affect the
election result.
Another important issue to recogni/e is
that \\ bite Plaza lias limited spat e, no
matter when groups began to post their
materials. Even it all groups bad begun to
post fliers at the same exa< t time, the walls
of the (.law ton main .md the banner spat e
on the Birdcage would have been tilled up
in minutes. While our mistake com
pounded the problem, the c ampaign start
date does not c hange the fact that not all
groups can post all of their material 111
\\ bite Plaza. I Ins lias alwa\ s been an issue
in ASM elections and is not the fault of
the Flections Commission or I niversitv
policy.
Because of the limited space, we have
encouraged and continue to encourage
campaigns to look into more original wax s
ot campaigning. The Campaign Practices
('.ode allows tor nianx unique wax s to c am
paign, and, to this point, the Flections
( Commission has not see n nianx groups at
tempting to reac li voters through new spa
per ads, town ball meetings, public
speeches or other events. Hopefully, the
groups that feel disadvantaged In our tnis
take will take the opportunity to reach vot
ers in more innovative xvavs. Let's remem
ber that posting fliers and banners in

White Plaza is onlv one, relatively ineffec
tive, wax to campaign. I laving a hundred
fliers on the ( law or havii g none will not
change the election outcome. Reaching
voters on a personal level will.

Elections Commission responds
to editorial
I he I >.iilx s Api il (> editoi 1.11 "I let tions
Commission .11 the; root c>f the problem is
.i series of unjustified and uninfoi nied ac -
c usations. It reflec is .1 fundamental niisuii
derstanding ot the ASSI . the elections
process and the new changes to tins pro
cess. As .1 whole, the editorial makes little
effort to ascertain the truth and we feel it
was an in just u e that it was published with
out contac ting 11s tii st.
Blaming the Flections ( Commission t<»i
the nature ot the campaigning that result
ed from a decision reached bx the (Consti
tutional Counc il is blatantlx incorrect. We
have no constitutional authority and onlx
execute the guidelines of the constitution
and its In-laws regarding campaigning.
I bus. if I he Dailx lias problems with the
wax the constitution directs the election. it
should look to the (Constitutional (Counc il
and the VSSI I ndei graduate Senate and
the (iraduate Student (Council.
Furthermore, the editorial speaks of
previously enforced rules. In the past,
rules that limit freedom of expression
have never been strictly enforced. It is
wrong to suggest that this year's commis
sion lias i hosen todist egarcl previous elec
tion law. Instead, the commission has be
come mote 111 line with the current consti
tution guaranteeing freedom of expres
sion to all candidates and slates. We as
sume that 1 lie Daily is not arguing that we
should limit freedom of speech.
112 he logic of tree speech also applies to
campaign spending limits. I his year, the
Constitutional Council decided that the
ASSI cannot limit the amount ot monex
spent In c andidates. I litis, the de c ision to
not enforce spending limits was nexei in
the hands of the Flections ('.ommission.
()nc phone call from I he Dailx could have
obtained this information and we- feel that
it is a clisseivie e to blame the (Commission.

In addition, 1 he l)ail\ tailed to report in
their editorial that there will be a ballot
measure addressing the issue of i ampaign
spending in future elections.
Regarding the special lees deadlines
.ind dates, the (■ommission sent an e-mail
to even \ olunteer Student ()rganization,
plat ed an ad in I he l)ail\ itself, posted to
all resident assistant lists and had the stall
from Stanford Student Fnterprises tlis
trihute fliers about the informational
meeting in |anuar\ l« »i groups seeking
special tees.
Any responsible group without internal
disorganization would have found it tliffi
t ult to miss this information. We find it
ironic that I lie l)ail\ was one of the
groups that tailed to attend this meeting
and meet most deadlines. Subsequent
deadlines wen* made available in hard
cop\ and online versions, and all groups
had access to .ill contact information.
ASS I President Setli Newton was not
ton I'd to hold .1 meeting to approve bal
lot placement lor groups that did not join
the elet lion propei l\. Instead, his admin
istration's commitment to supporting stu
dent funding was die reason he < hose to
allow exceptions to out deadlines.
Although we are accountable to the
campaigning date problems (and have
since addressed them), the commission
was not able to tompletch update the
I let lions Handbook until April I bet ause
of pending spet ial fee submissions. As dis
missed above, groups int luding 1 lie l)ail\
did not Ibllow out timeline, and, there
fore, we were ni< e enough todela\ posting
the handbook We did this fbi the benefit
<»112 these groups.
I*inallv, the toinnlent about the timing
ot the election is anothet example of poor
journalism, l ievoi Sutton's April ft article
(1 lections too close loi conitort") atl
th esses this issue ver\ well and explains
the position oft he ASS I . Ii is ridiculous to
assert that students should have more time
to campaign in ortlei to "recovei from
spi ing break. ()ne intention of the < oni
mission w.is to prevent stutleuts from liav
ing to (ampaign dm ing midterms. We as
sunie that an\ high-achieving Stanford
n|i ii lei it would i at her organize at ampaign
during a break and the lii st week < »l ( lass
es than three weeks into the quarter. A
timeline was presented to students in fin
nan at a will-advertised meeting, lo act
as i| ii w,is tin 11 si upon them is silh. We
hope that in the future I he l)ail\ will woi k
I l.ndei to obtain the truth before making
blatant and uuintbi med act usations.

Students don't deserve Fiorina
I would like to echo the sentiments ot
other alumni who have expressed their
support otC.arK Fiorina as Commence
ment speaker for this vcar. At the same
time, 1 want to criticize all three groups in
volved iu the current issue—l niversitv
President John I lenness\. the senior class
presidents and the senior (lass student
both. Shame on all of you.
First, I lenncssv: It appears t learthat lie
neither t learb nor adequately communi
cated to the class presidents, the senior
t lass or the Stanford communit\ at large
what the prot ess is tor selecting the speak
er. Ot particular importance is the fact
that, as with speakers past, it ultiinateh is
bis t hoice and bis choice alone. I think he
also should have laid out the broad criteria
he planned to use to determine the speak
er. His conduct in this prot ess suggests a
lat k of consideration for the graduating
class that Fiorina will address. 1 find tins
tondiK t exemplars of a growing trend of
Stanford presidents ignoring the students
who are their customers. Ii became 111-
creasinglv clear with former I'niversitv
President (ierhard ('.asper and appeal s to
be continuing with I lennessv.
I he senior ( lass presidents have done a
disservice to the (lass that elet let! them bv
attempting to absolve themselves from the
selection process entirely. Irrespective of
w bet her Fiorina was on vout top-10 list or
not, von should have learned what the se
lection process was. Ii hasn't changed.
I ranklv, you have no excuse for not hav
ing done your homework.
finally, shame on those in the senior
( lass who feel that Fiorina is not worthy to
be youi ( ommcncement speaker. You eli
tist snobs! You have embarrassed Stan
ford with vour reaction to being lucky
enough to have someone like Fiorina as
your speaker. In addition to being a Stan
ford alumnus. I am also a Hewlett-
Pat kard employee, for the past lour days,
I have had to defend in\ alma mater, and,
in particular, the conduct of the senior
t lass. I lie stutleuts have presented them

selves .ts not w anting Fiorina to be their
Commencement speaker. That she
doesn't rank higlilv enough on their
honor s* .ile to merit this invitation is an
outright joke. No need to go into her qual
ifications.
l.asil\, I would like to share with this se
nioi < lass that the ('.ominencement speak
er lor m\ class was Rolxrt Maynard, pub
lishei of tfie Oakland I rihune (now de
funct). I wonder whether he would have
ranked high enough on the 1111 rent elitist
st ale to wan ant an invitation from this
< l.iss. I .suspect that il he were treated the
\\.i\ the senior c lass has treated Fiorina, he
might have declined the invitation. Part of
me hopes thai Fiorina declines the invita
tion, too. \ 011 don't deserve someone of
hei class.
