Newton, Villegas evaluate past year,
endorse presidential slate
V VSSl clct lions have .11 rived bearing
.1 plcthoia of presidential and vice presi
dential candidates wing tot vonr support,
we would like to take this oppoiinnit\ to
share some thoughtson student represen
tation at Stanford. I ndet Iving the \ai ions
platforms of these presidential and viee
presidential candidates are assumptions
about what student representation is and
should be. As von attempt to wade
through the issues and principles these
candidates present, we wish to oflei some
insights about how we have approached
"representing" the voice of students.
()ver the p.ist vear as vonr ASSl pres
ident and vice president, we have imple
mented a model that is rooted in two < en
tral oh jet lives: I he first is increasing the
voice of students and accountahilit\ of
the administration in I niversitv deci
sion-making. and the second is treating
empowering structures that allow stu
dents to pursue .1 meaningful Stanford
experience.
I he first aim hinges on bringing stu
dents to the table .it all levels of the I 111-
vei sit\ s det ision-making prot ess. ()nr 111-
volvement with the undergraduate pat ent
community demonstrates a commitment
to this aim. It means being explicit about
which of the manv tables students should
be at. and specifving who will bring whom
to the table. I Tie I niversitv administra
tion has a rcsponsibilitv to be transparent

.md accountable to its students as mem
bers of the Stanford community. It also
means prioritizing issues according to the
most deeply and widely It-It student needs
on ( anipus. while being conscious ol issue
areas and legacies ol under'representa
tion. As such, the current status and future
of our community tenters has been .1 pri
ority for us.
I he second aspiration accepts the idea
that as students are the primary agents 111
treating their own Stanford experience,
the ASSI should be invested in providing
the tools for students to build their experi
ences and our community instead of im
posing its ow 11 limited \ lew ol the Stanlord
experience or community . Our commit
ment to this investment is evidenced in the
ASSI s new program. Student Initiated
Courses. (It is not too late to take a SIC
t lass this quarter.)
Although we were fortunate to have
been involved in introducing it to the
ASSI . it is the breadth of student partici
pation that went into creating and articu
lating this model ol student representa
tion that makes it critically valid. As such, it
would be irresponsible of us not to take a
stance on the next phase ol ASSL leader
ship. Yet. it is important to do so without
abusing our positions. That said, we are
firmly committed to providing a smooth
transition to whichever slate the students
elect.
In reviewing the candidates and slates
lor ASSL president and vice president,
the following characteristics were very im

port.ml: the individuals previous invest
ment iu .jihl action on the issues they talk
about in their platforms; strong know-how
.uul experience when it comes to under
standing both the workings of the ASM
and the administration; and a commit
ment to building upon (w hie h necessitates
an in-depth understanding of) the above
model of student representation. CÂ»iven
these criteria, one slate stood above the
rest.
We urge you to join us in supporting
Matt Brewer and Christine Cordero for
ASSI president and vice president. Along
with the above characteristics and main
concrete ideas. Brewer and (.ordero have
a firm grasp of the opportunities afforded
by and complexities of student represen
tation at Stanford. Among other qualities,
they embody a commitment to the dual
etuis of increasing the strength of the stu
dent voice in I niversitv decision-making
and creating structures that allow students
to define their Stanford experience.

and Wednesday at http: elcctions.stan
