I'atti Walters worked with eight
students in I rban Stutlies 177:
"Architecture and (ommunit\

lo get ideas for their design,
students heard from local archi
tects and guest speakers. They
also met with homeless people tor
suggestions.
Senior ) ulia Sherbakov said she
reallv enjoved meeting with four
homeless men to hear what thev
want and need. According to
Sherbakov, thev "were really excit
ed to have students there."
The men's suggestions for
showers and l« k kers influenced the
students' design of the first fkx>r of
the centei. In addition to the stor
age and showei s, the center will
also have three floois ol housing,
on-site health and job counselors,
and a lamih suite for women and
children.

Anothei (lass member, junior
Stephanie Sun. said she is exc iteel
to see the opportnnit\ center

I hough she found the design

ing process a little complex, slit
said that "this tvpeof realitv-based
participation in the surrounding

Stanford students, and I think
that I rban Studies 177 can and
should be used as a model lot

disciplines."
I his quarter, two other c lasses
in the I rban Studies Department
are looking at \\.i\s architecture
and design can be used to help so
