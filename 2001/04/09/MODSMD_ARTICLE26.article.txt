## Scoring surge helps Card win 16th straight series 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Based on its explosive plav in the final two games
against I (.1 _\ this weekend, it is i lear that Stanfiud s
baseball team must not like to lose.
On second thought, the team must really, realb
hate it.
After dropping its first game to I ( LA (21-11, 1-5
Pacific 10 C.onference) on Saturdav, the top-ranked
Cardinal (27-7, (>-2) took it> frustration out on the
Bruins l>\ outscoring them, 20-2. in the next two
games to win the series.
I he series \ it ton this weekend was the ( ardinal's
Kith straight, dating bat k to last season.
Juniors Jeff Bruksch (7-0) and Mike (iosling (2-0)
took charge on the mound, pat ing the ( artlinal with
solid pitching performances. Bruksth threw eight
scoreless innings on Saturda\ night to pit k up his se\-
enth win in his last eight starts.
Jell came up really big for us. head coach Mark
Marquess said. "After getting beat in the litsi game,
we really needed the second contest."
Not to be outdone l>\ Bruksch, (iosling came up
big in the rubber game on Sundax. I le pitched seven
scoreless innings before gi\ ing up his onl\ run in the
eighth inning when Randall Shelle\ hit a home run
over the left-field fence. I he run was the first allowed
In (iosling in 12 innings.
"I le was masterful toda\. and his command was so
good," Marquess saitl of (iosling. who onl\ needed to
throw 90 pitt lies in his eight innings of work. "I Its
more of a pitcher than just a hard thrower now."
I lie only question after the game w.is whethei
(iosling's arm was still bothering him on the mound,
a concern the preseason second-team All American
denied.
"Mv elbow feels great, and 1 don't think that's a
problem." he saitl. "What 1 just need now is innings.

and tod.in helped a lot."
Bei ause <>l (iosling\ good health, Marquess made
it clear tluit the leti-handed Imrler would t.ike the
place ot sophomore 1 1111 Cunningham in the week
end starting rotation. ( unningham will most likelv be
used to start I itcsdax night games tor the rest ot the
season.
Due to the (animal's dominam e on the mound,
the plavers were able to relax .it the plate and torment
the Bruins' piuliing.

Stanford made it dear early in the rubber game
that it wasn't satisfied with the nine runs it hatl scored

Based on its explosive plav in the final two games
against I (.1 _\ this weekend, it is i lear that Stanfiud s
baseball team must not like to lose.
On second thought, the team must really, realb
hate it.
After dropping its first game to I ( LA (21-11, 1-5
Pacific 10 C.onference) on Saturdav, the top-ranked
Cardinal (27-7, (>-2) took it> frustration out on the
Bruins l>\ outscoring them, 20-2. in the next two
games to win the series.
I he series \ it ton this weekend was the ( ardinal's
Kith straight, dating bat k to last season.
Juniors Jeff Bruksch (7-0) and Mike (iosling (2-0)
took charge on the mound, pat ing the ( artlinal with
solid pitching performances. Bruksth threw eight
scoreless innings on Saturda\ night to pit k up his se\-
enth win in his last eight starts.
Jell came up really big for us. head coach Mark
Marquess said. "After getting beat in the litsi game,
we really needed the second contest."
Not to be outdone l>\ Bruksch, (iosling came up
big in the rubber game on Sundax. I le pitched seven
scoreless innings before gi\ ing up his onl\ run in the
eighth inning when Randall Shelle\ hit a home run
over the left-field fence. I he run was the first allowed
In (iosling in 12 innings.
"I le was masterful toda\. and his command was so
good," Marquess saitl of (iosling. who onl\ needed to
throw 90 pitt lies in his eight innings of work. "I Its
more of a pitcher than just a hard thrower now."
I lie only question after the game w.is whethei
(iosling's arm was still bothering him on the mound,
a concern the preseason second-team All American
denied.
"Mv elbow feels great, and 1 don't think that's a
problem." he saitl. "What 1 just need now is innings.

and tod.in helped a lot."
Bei ause <>l (iosling\ good health, Marquess made
it clear tluit the leti-handed Imrler would t.ike the
place ot sophomore 1 1111 Cunningham in the week
end starting rotation. ( unningham will most likelv be
used to start I itcsdax night games tor the rest ot the
season.
Due to the (animal's dominam e on the mound,
the plavers were able to relax .it the plate and torment
the Bruins' piuliing.

11l uli.it looked more like- batting prattier than I'a
titic 10 Conference games, Stanford rung up 11 it*
scoreboard on Saturda\ night and Sunda\, taking its
fifth straight series against the Bruins and winning its
25th of its last 28 games.
1 "he offensive attack in Stanlord \ I 1 -2 win on Sun
day was enough to get main ot the 2,61 I lans at
Sunken Diamond up to "twist and shout when the
Kisle\ Brothers' song placed in the middle of the sc\-
enth inning.

Stanford made it dear early in the rubber game
that it wasn't satisfied with the nine runs it hatl scored
the previous night. Junior |ason VanMeetren led oil
the daVs storing with his sixth home run of the sea
son — a solo home run in the bottom ol the first in
ning off ol Bruin pitt hei Wade (Hark, to give the (Car
dinal a 1-0 lead.
I lie (Cardinal broke the game open in the third in
ning In scoring tour runs to extend Us lead to five.
First, VanMeetren hit a bullet toward left-center field
that staved in pla\ this time for an Rill double, stor
ing freshman Sain l uld from first base. Van Meetren
then scored on an RBI single up the middle In junior
Scott Dragicevich.
Later in the inning. Bruin left fielder Adam Bern
committed two errors on the same |>la\ that helped
the (Cardinal store two more runs. Sophomore R\an
Ciarko hit an RBI single to left field that Bern
'couldn't handle, and freshman (Carlos Onentin was
able to score. Once Bern tr.ii ketl the ball down, he
made a throw toward second base that no one was
able to field, and l)i agicevit h took advantage bv t ross
ing home plate as well.
