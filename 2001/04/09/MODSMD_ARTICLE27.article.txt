"We did pretty well." junior Cade Rag

didn't think we'd be in the position of even
being able to compete in the NCAAs, so
we're satisfied."'
|unior co-captain David Durante agreed
with his teammate.
"We performed a lot better." he said. "We
kind of screwed up on high bar, and actual

points higher than we did, but it was realU a
strong perform.nice.'
Considering that this young team saw
reaching the N( '.A As .is a long shot earlier in

the \e.n , the experieiu e alone was a ver\ im
portant one for the team.
"It was good to see that level of competi
tion and to gain the expel ience of pel form
ing there, especialh for the voungei mem
bers." Durante said. "It's always exciting to
see top teams pel forming theii best in that
type of environment with so main fans
around.

Durante finished 17th overall, recording
a 50.00.
"I w.is prettv cxt ited to make it to the all

though."
