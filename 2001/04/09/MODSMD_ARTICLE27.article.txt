Although the show is over for the 2001
Stanford men's gv ninastit s season, the ( ar
dinal made sure its exit in the NCAA
(lhampiouships last weekend was one t<> be
proud of .
I lie No. 12 Cardinal finished sixth in it>
six-team qualify ing group and 1 2th overall,
but its 208.875 score beat the previous sea
son-high total b\ over two points.
I lost ()hio State, led In Raj Bhavsar and
Olympic alternate Jamie Natalie, grabbed
the N( A\ title with a score of 218.125. I hey
were followed b\ No. 2 Oklahoma, while
California claimed the third spot.
"We did pretty well." junior Cade Rag
gio said. "We showed improvements over
all, and we were pretl> happy with how we
did. At the beginning of the year, we
didn't think we'd be in the position of even
being able to compete in the NCAAs, so
we're satisfied."'
|unior co-captain David Durante agreed
with his teammate.
"We performed a lot better." he said. "We
kind of screwed up on high bar, and actual
ly had a chance to go maybe two or three
points higher than we did, but it was realU a
strong perform.nice.'
Considering that this young team saw
reaching the N( '.A As .is a long shot earlier in

the \e.n , the experieiu e alone was a ver\ im
portant one for the team.
"It was good to see that level of competi
tion and to gain the expel ience of pel form
ing there, especialh for the voungei mem
bers." Durante said. "It's always exciting to
see top teams pel forming theii best in that
type of environment with so main fans
around.
Because onl\ the top three teams in each
qualifying round of six advanced to the fi
nals. the men finished team < ompetition or.
Thursday night. However, individually, a
few members <Â»112 the squad put up top per
formances that tarried them into the later
rounds of competition.
Durante had an outstanding perfor
mance timing rhurstlav night's competi
tion, leading the Cardinal with Ins highest
point total of the year. 1 lis 52.20 landed him
in fifth place overall in the first round, and it
qualified him loi the individual all-around
finals on Friday night.
Durante finished 17th overall, recording
a 50.00.
"I w.is prettv cxt ited to make it to the all
around finals, because not everyone gets a
chance to do that," he said. "I wish Friday
night would have gone a little better,
though."
