### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
Aftei last weekend. the Stanford men's
tennis team just might have to (.ill K.J.
I lippensteel the "Man ol Steel.
I lippensteel, .1 junior, tanked No. 22
in the nation, was the < Inn li player in
both matches ilns p.ist weekend against
1(1.A and Southern (California, as lie
clinched both team victories with two
nail-biting, three-set wins.
More imporlantlv . with the \ ictoi ics
ovei No. I I (:LA (16-1, 3-1 Pacific l<>
( onference) and No. 20 I SC (1 1 I -
I), the No. <> Cardinal (15-1, -1-0) has
put itself in excellent position as the fa
vorite to win the NCAA (champi
onships in May.
Furthermore, the team's accomplish
ment over the weekend ma\ prove to be
1 lie most important in determining the iis
success.
" I bis win puts us in good position for
a top seed at NCAAs, said sophomore
1 ).i\ i< 1 Martin. "We are in control of out
own destiny if we are able to win out the
rest of the season."
Most impressive was the win ovei
1(1 A bee ause, with that vie tot v.the ('.ar
dinal will undoubtedly move up in the
rankings, forcing I (.LA to relinquish its
c in 1 cut No. 1 spot. With the win, the (Car
dinal .ilso handed the Bruins their first
overall loss of the season.
Hie Cardinal had a lot riding on the
match with I CIA, especialh because the
onlv blemish on Stanford's record w.is a
1-2 loss against I (.1 .A in the finals of the
National I'cam Indoor Championships
in mid-February.
Stanford went into the match on Fri
day with .1 bit ol .111 advantage because
two of LCIA's ranked players were ab
sent, including its No. 1 player. Jean
|ulien Rojer.
Rojer. ranked No. 9 nationally, is cur
rently competing in Uruguay in the Davis
Cup for Netherlands-Antilles. Hie bru
ins' No. plaver', No. IS Tobias ('.lemons
is still recovering from an ankle injury
sustained earlier in the season against
I SC.
Despite this slight advantage, associate
head coach John Whitlinger was still very
pleased with the victory.
1 lie absences gave Stanford "a nice
opportunity, but that still doesn't guaran
tee us a win because good teams like
I CIA overcome adversity like that," he
said. "IfWe win at U( 1A in any way, it is
always very impressive."
Just as the coaches predicted, UCIA

did a good job compensating foi its losses
at No. 1 and:> singles, with other players
stepping up to sta\ neck and neck with
the (Cardinal.
I he match could not h.ivc been an\
closer.
I nlike what happened in the first
matt h between the two squads, the (Car
dinal jumped out to an earlv 1-0 lead In
capturing the ever-important doubles
point In winning two out of the three
matt lies.
I lie No. I doubles team <>1 llippen

ranketl pair of Iravis Rcttcnmaier and
Man in Matkowski.
