### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
Aftei last weekend. the Stanford men's
tennis team just might have to (.ill K.J.
I lippensteel the "Man ol Steel.
I lippensteel, .1 junior, tanked No. 22
in the nation, was the < Inn li player in
both matches ilns p.ist weekend against
1(1.A and Southern (California, as lie
clinched both team victories with two
nail-biting, three-set wins.
More imporlantlv . with the \ ictoi ics
ovei No. I I (:LA (16-1, 3-1 Pacific l<>
( onference) and No. 20 I SC (1 1 I -
I), the No. <> Cardinal (15-1, -1-0) has
put itself in excellent position as the fa
vorite to win the NCAA (champi
onships in May.
Furthermore, the team's accomplish
ment over the weekend ma\ prove to be
1 lie most important in determining the iis
success.
" I bis win puts us in good position for
a top seed at NCAAs, said sophomore
1 ).i\ i< 1 Martin. "We are in control of out
own destiny if we are able to win out the
rest of the season."
Most impressive was the win ovei
1(1 A bee ause, with that vie tot v.the ('.ar
dinal will undoubtedly move up in the
rankings, forcing I (.LA to relinquish its
c in 1 cut No. 1 spot. With the win, the (Car
dinal .ilso handed the Bruins their first
overall loss of the season.
Hie Cardinal had a lot riding on the
match with I CIA, especialh because the
onlv blemish on Stanford's record w.is a
1-2 loss against I (.1 .A in the finals of the
National I'cam Indoor Championships
in mid-February.
Stanford went into the match on Fri
day with .1 bit ol .111 advantage because
two of LCIA's ranked players were ab
sent, including its No. 1 player. Jean
|ulien Rojer.
Rojer. ranked No. 9 nationally, is cur
rently competing in Uruguay in the Davis
Cup for Netherlands-Antilles. Hie bru
ins' No. plaver', No. IS Tobias ('.lemons
is still recovering from an ankle injury
sustained earlier in the season against
I SC.
Despite this slight advantage, associate
head coach John Whitlinger was still very
pleased with the victory.
1 lie absences gave Stanford "a nice
opportunity, but that still doesn't guaran
tee us a win because good teams like
I CIA overcome adversity like that," he
said. "IfWe win at U( 1A in any way, it is
always very impressive."
Just as the coaches predicted, UCIA

did a good job compensating foi its losses
at No. 1 and:> singles, with other players
stepping up to sta\ neck and neck with
the (Cardinal.
I he match could not h.ivc been an\
closer.
I nlike what happened in the first
matt h between the two squads, the (Car
dinal jumped out to an earlv 1-0 lead In
capturing the ever-important doubles
point In winning two out of the three
matt lies.
I lie No. I doubles team <>1 llippen
steel and senioi Alex Kim. which just
broke the top .">() in the (It)ubles rankings
foi the fii st time this year at No. 23, eked
out the victorv, 8-6, against the 26th
ranketl pair of Iravis Rcttcnmaier and
Man in Matkowski.
(Consistent \ tout in lies to be the name
of the game for Mat tin anil fellow sopho
more Seott\ I.ipskv. who moved up to
third in the nation and improved to 26-2,
as thev defeated the team of |ean Noel

I he onh team that lost was the 22nd
ranketl team of seniors All Ansari anil
Scott\ Scott, who lost to la fan Djahangiri
and I .assi Ketola. 8-4. The team of'Ansai i
and Scott dropped to MM).
Mikli to the Cardinal's disniav. nei
ther. No. 77 sophomore Rvan Havilantl
nor the struggling No. .'<l Martin put
forth ninth of a fight as No. 88 Dja
hangiri and No. {)() Rettemnaier pulled
off the upsets l>\ winning ver\ t|ui< klv in
straight sets.
Ansari. who has been one of the more
reliable plavei s over the season, lived up
to his reputation In defeating Sands at
No. 6 singles. 6-'{. 6-2, to tie up the over
all store at two.
I he match continued to go back anil
forth as Scott lost at No. 1 singles to 1 -issi
Ketola, 6-1, 6-2, and No. 2 Kim defeated
No. 78 Crinda at No. I singles. 6-4, 6-1.
Kiln's win set the stage lor Hippensteel's
heroic s.
