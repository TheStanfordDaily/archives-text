### MARK BOUCHER EDITORIAL STAFF 
This year's ASS I presidential
race features a slate th.it promises
apocalyptic change, scandal,
nepotism and.in enoi inous party.
I lie candidates who are basing
their platform on these uncon
ventional ideas are senior Gideon

Lewis-Kraus and junior Jacob
Young, co-editors of the Stanford
Chaparral.
Ke\vis-Kraus and Young, also
called the "Harbingers of Apoca
lyptic Change," cite three objec
tives for their electoral quest. The
primary goal is to gain publicity
for the Chaparral. Stanford's
humor maga/ine, in the special

lee elections. They .ilso seek to
mock how seriously the ASSU
takes itsell and to entertain the
campus.
Finally, they maintain a maga
zine tradition. The Chaparral has
run other presidential, vice-pres
idential and senatorial candidates
in past years. According to
Young, a Chaparral-sponsored
slate called "The Dictators from
()uter Space" ran a few vears ago.
The candidates walked around
the campus in silver uniforms to
garnet attention.
The Chaparral did not run a
slate in last year's elections, and
the slate in 1999 was disqualified
because the presidential candi
date did not registei lor classes

Lewis-Kraus served as a (lliap
arral candidate in the I ndei
graduate Senate last veai. llc said
he was "belligerent, unpleasant
and boorish during the meet
ings."
Lewis-Kraus and Young
promise lirst to dissolve the I n

"pretentious bureaucracv" and
"long, boring meetings."
