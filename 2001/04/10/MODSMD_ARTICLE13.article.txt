we felt we could (over the cost of printing and clis
-11 ibuting the paper without asking students foi help.
I his vear. fat ing .in econoini( downturn, we real
ized we could no longer afford to (over out costs
without returning to the special-fee proc ess. the
time this was apparent, the first spec ial-fee deadline
was upon us, but we hoped .111 arrangement could be
readied based upon our past rates of approval and
unique servit e to the commuuit\.
1 hough I .1111 glad we decided to undergo the
process, m\ onl\ reason for feeling this wav rests in
the knowledge that next year's spring staff will, 1
hope, have a model to follow and. conse<|iientl\. an
easiei time of working with the ASSI . In all m\ in
teraction with I niversitN communities — students,
alumni, stafl and fa< ultv alike — whether positive or
negative, 1 have never felt more abused 01 less re
spec ted than I did in this veai 's ASSI spec ial-fee and
election proc ess.
As evidenced b\ the Klec tions Commission's let
ters printed in I lie l)ail\ and the commission's in
teractions with individuals on the Daih staff — in
m.it tei s concerning both out spec ial-fee applic at ion
.ind out news and opinions elections coverage —
ratliei than attempting to offer the newspaper con
structive criticism. ASSI officials have consistentlv
< liosen instead to berate I he l)ail\ for its own late
spec ial-fee application.
It is not "ironic," as Narens and llurwit wrote in
tlicit lettei ("Klec lions ( oinmission 1 esponds to edito
rial") Mondav, that I lie Daih was one of the groups
being considered after the deadline. Rather, it was a
matter of necessit\ to which the commission should
have been sensitive, espec i.ilh (cinsidering 1 he I >ail\ s
stated willingness to comply with an\ and all ASSI
polic ics 1 egarditig the- spec ial-fee application process.
What's more, one e we decided to apply tor a spe
cial fee, we did. 111 fact, send representatives to the
special-fee meetings and remained 111 constant tone li
w iih the elections officials. despite their condescend
ing tone, genei al unwillingness tooffei the most basic
help and even outright hostility.
foi instance, when asked to provide I he Daih
with bindet s of the mtoi illation submitted In eac li of
the special-fee groups to facilitate the endorsement
interview process — something the Klections Com
mission has done even year in the past — the edito
-1 ial board was informed that the commission was too
bus\. We were told to utilize the Web site, wliic h, of
c ourse. was not properly updated until after the en
dorsement interviews had already begun and, even
over the weekend, was not completeh functional 01

accurate. And. when we attempted to get 111 touch
with the commission over spring break to rectify this
situation, the members were now here to be found.
(liven this experience, lean onlx imagine what
others went through. Kverx slate for .VSSI president
and vice president that has interviexved with Ihe
I).ulx's editorial board 111 preparation tor the paper's
endorsements has stressed the ASSI "s relationship to
student groups and the central role those groups oc
cupx in the ASSI 's mission. And. vet, every group ap
plying for special fee that has interviewed with 11s as
part of the same process has said, 111 no uncertain
terms, that their interaction with the ASSI during
this period has been nothing short ol painful.
()bviously, there is a disconnect here.
The plaque above the door to niv high school
newspaper office reads, " I lie test ol gootl journalism
is the measure ol its public service," and I tarry that
with me alw ays. 1 hat said, 1 recognize— and am fully
ready to utilize to the benefit of the greater campus
community — the integral role Ihe Dailx can and
does pi.ix 111 disseminating information to students.
But the organizations for xvhicli we exercise this
civic duty, which reaches beyond our join nliastic re
sponsibilities, should meet us at least part of the wax.
Recognize that, without 1 be Daily's coverage of this
election, tew would even know an election was on the
horizon. Recognize that, without I lie Daily's efforts to
give each candidate a tornni to express his 01 her views,
tew would be aware of the issues at all. And recognize
that, without .1 positive working relationship between
two ot this campus's largest and most visible indepen
dent organizations, we can <k complish nothing.
I Ins xear's Chaparral slate, though admittedly
somewhat outside the realm of the actual election,
brings an interesting and important point to the
fore. I he ASSI does take itself too seriously, and it
does not take seriously enough its obligation to stu
dents and student groups. Do not get so caught up
in policy and protocol that xou disillusion the very
people tor xvliom you were elec ted or appointed.
I lelp us to bring credibility back to this and future
elections and.in the process, begin to restore faitb
in the political process that should empower,
rather than frustrate, those willing to work for the
Stanford community.

plying because revenue had reached .1 point where
we felt we could (over the cost of printing and clis
-11 ibuting the paper without asking students foi help.
I his vear. fat ing .in econoini( downturn, we real
ized we could no longer afford to (over out costs
without returning to the special-fee proc ess. the
time this was apparent, the first spec ial-fee deadline
was upon us, but we hoped .111 arrangement could be
readied based upon our past rates of approval and
unique servit e to the commuuit\.
1 hough I .1111 glad we decided to undergo the
process, m\ onl\ reason for feeling this wav rests in
the knowledge that next year's spring staff will, 1
hope, have a model to follow and. conse<|iientl\. an
easiei time of working with the ASSI . In all m\ in
teraction with I niversitN communities — students,
alumni, stafl and fa< ultv alike — whether positive or
negative, 1 have never felt more abused 01 less re
spec ted than I did in this veai 's ASSI spec ial-fee and
election proc ess.
As evidenced b\ the Klec tions Commission's let
ters printed in I lie l)ail\ and the commission's in
teractions with individuals on the Daih staff — in
m.it tei s concerning both out spec ial-fee applic at ion
.ind out news and opinions elections coverage —
ratliei than attempting to offer the newspaper con
structive criticism. ASSI officials have consistentlv
< liosen instead to berate I he l)ail\ for its own late
spec ial-fee application.
It is not "ironic," as Narens and llurwit wrote in
tlicit lettei ("Klec lions ( oinmission 1 esponds to edito
rial") Mondav, that I lie Daih was one of the groups
being considered after the deadline. Rather, it was a
matter of necessit\ to which the commission should
have been sensitive, espec i.ilh (cinsidering 1 he I >ail\ s
stated willingness to comply with an\ and all ASSI
polic ics 1 egarditig the- spec ial-fee application process.
What's more, one e we decided to apply tor a spe
cial fee, we did. 111 fact, send representatives to the
special-fee meetings and remained 111 constant tone li
w iih the elections officials. despite their condescend
ing tone, genei al unwillingness tooffei the most basic
help and even outright hostility.
foi instance, when asked to provide I he Daih
with bindet s of the mtoi illation submitted In eac li of
the special-fee groups to facilitate the endorsement
interview process — something the Klections Com
mission has done even year in the past — the edito
-1 ial board was informed that the commission was too
bus\. We were told to utilize the Web site, wliic h, of
c ourse. was not properly updated until after the en
dorsement interviews had already begun and, even
over the weekend, was not completeh functional 01

accurate. And. when we attempted to get 111 touch
with the commission over spring break to rectify this
situation, the members were now here to be found.
(liven this experience, lean onlx imagine what
others went through. Kverx slate for .VSSI president
and vice president that has interviexved with Ihe
I).ulx's editorial board 111 preparation tor the paper's
endorsements has stressed the ASSI "s relationship to
student groups and the central role those groups oc
cupx in the ASSI 's mission. And. vet, every group ap
plying for special fee that has interviewed with 11s as
part of the same process has said, 111 no uncertain
terms, that their interaction with the ASSI during
this period has been nothing short ol painful.
()bviously, there is a disconnect here.
The plaque above the door to niv high school
newspaper office reads, " I lie test ol gootl journalism
is the measure ol its public service," and I tarry that
with me alw ays. 1 hat said, 1 recognize— and am fully
ready to utilize to the benefit of the greater campus
community — the integral role Ihe Dailx can and
does pi.ix 111 disseminating information to students.
But the organizations for xvhicli we exercise this
civic duty, which reaches beyond our join nliastic re
sponsibilities, should meet us at least part of the wax.
Recognize that, without 1 be Daily's coverage of this
election, tew would even know an election was on the
horizon. Recognize that, without I lie Daily's efforts to
give each candidate a tornni to express his 01 her views,
tew would be aware of the issues at all. And recognize
that, without .1 positive working relationship between
two ot this campus's largest and most visible indepen
dent organizations, we can <k complish nothing.
I Ins xear's Chaparral slate, though admittedly
somewhat outside the realm of the actual election,
brings an interesting and important point to the
fore. I he ASSI does take itself too seriously, and it
does not take seriously enough its obligation to stu
dents and student groups. Do not get so caught up
in policy and protocol that xou disillusion the very
people tor xvliom you were elec ted or appointed.
I lelp us to bring credibility back to this and future
elections and.in the process, begin to restore faitb
in the political process that should empower,
rather than frustrate, those willing to work for the
Stanford community.

Editorial Hoard Note: In discussing ASSL elections
and The Daily 's endorsement process, the newspaper s
editorial hoard members came to the conclusion that
the events of this year's elation, particularly as they
played out with and in Ihe Daily, merited some dis
enssion in the Opinions section. WV felt this would he
most appropriate coming from the editor in chief, hut
would like to register our strong support for the view s
she expresses in this piece.
