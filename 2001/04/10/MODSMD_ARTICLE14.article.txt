## We should see the graffiti

A terrible transgression recenth
took place here, hut we, the stu

Lhing we ought tt» know il we are
going to deal with it in a meaningful wa\
List luesdav, I he Dailx reported in .1
front-page ston that "racist grattiti had
heen discovered 111 several campus build
ings at the end of Winter (.hiai let Iheat -

tide was ver\ explicit
about where the graffiti
was found (Buildings
200 and 50 and later
more was discovered in
Meyer Libraea ) and
when it was Ix'lievcd t<>
have been written
(sometime between
March 16 and 20). Stu
dents were even told

thai police* believe all of flu* messages wen
written bv the same itidi\ klual and that tlu
perpetrator's i< h >1 of choice was .1 black

Hut the article said absoluteb nothing

we were told was that the messages wcu
"white supremacist and anti-Asian. N<
photos of the evidence, which police <|uk k

lished alongside the at tic le.
On "Iliursdav, 1 he Daily printed an
open letter from I niversitv President |ohn

Hennessx in which he condemned the
racist grafliti and encouraged the students
to "unite in out rcjec lion" ol the .illilucles
behind it. Assistant Dean of Students
I onum I ,ee Woon sent an e-mail to all res
ident assistants asking them to evaluate
how students felt about the inc idem.

itself is kept a secret.
Let there be 110 doubt about it: lhe stu
dent bod\ has been left in the dark on ibis
one. While the Lniversitv and the police
have said that thc\ are committed to find
ing the perpetrator and preventing similar
crimes, both seem ver\ reluctant to let us
know exactlv w hat is going on. An article in
last Wednesdays San Francisco Chronicle
desc 1 ibed a "flap" that developed Ix-tween
the police.mcl ( ommunication Prof. Lima
Feels after Feels posted two photos of the
giaffiii online as part of a survev 011 the un
pad hale messages have on the perceiver.
According to the Chronicle, the Stan
ford police aren't happ\ with Lcets, who
keeps the photos online even though the
police have been going to "great lengths" to
avoid disclosing the actual content of the
messages, "not foi investigative reasons.

racial and ethnic groups that were targets
of the graffiti."
I hanks. Dad, hul I'm 22 vears old now
,ind 1 don't need tovou shield me from the
ways of the world anvniore. I appreciate
that the police ,ire thinking of m\ feelings,
but I have a right to know what the graffiti
said, and students deserve to know e\a< tl\
w hat is going on within t licit coinmunitv.
I can understand, though, that certain

parties might prefer tlf content of the mes

Stanford's reputati#n would sureh be tar

Mow iiuifi docs it upset noii to knov

that the perpetrator is likely someone

If the police and the I niversitv are gen

about this situation, then it isabsoluteb nec

Kii n| of all, there are at least a few stu
dents here w ho honest l\ believe that rac ism
doesn't exist anvtnore and, more impor
tant . that it doesn't exist at Stanford. 1 'his
gi affiti in proof that tlie\ are mistaken. ()ur
blessedh naive friends ma\ nevet be forced

pet haps thev will begin to understand and
work alongside us to prevent this from hap
pening again.
Second, the C'.hronicle reported that the
police have few leads and no suspects in this
ease. Mavbe they'd have one if the public
was given ample access to the evidence and
a chance toidentih the pet petratot 's hand
writing and phraseology. I here is a traitoi
among us. We c an help find him.
I 'bird, it w ill be impossible for us to unite
as a community and address the underly
ing issues of hate, ignorance and violetu e if
this incident is simply swept undei the i ug
without anyone knowing the whole stois.
Like it or not, Stanford should take some
responsibilit\ for everything that happens

on lis campus, even 11 u* bad things. I et's
not make tlic mistake ot pretending that
tln> never look |>l.u t* sitnph l)ecause it
doesn't make us proud.
