University prevents 'critical exchange of
ideas' by limiting fliering space
With elections Ihis week, slogans and
blight postci s max add a c olorful splash to
eanipiis. hut (on fusion alxnit tin- start time
and la< k ol spate have prevented am real
opportunity for student dialogue. Krik
Wong's Apt il ti at tide ("ASM flicringcon
liision turns costly tor some fee cam
paigns") aeeuratelv portraved how mam
student groups following ASM guidelines
were left with no spate for fliering on the
first da\ of campaigning. As Wong report
ed, when the (loek lower rung out mid
night on the first Monda\ ol the quarter,
students armed with masking tape scram
bled to find spate to share information
about iheii programs.
A campaign, after .ill, is a grand old ef
foi t at education — getting a message out.
Sadly, Stanford shuns this critical ex
change of ideas. In relegating campaign
space to the outer Claw facade, bulletin
area and a few wooden bollards, the I ni
versity and Flections Commission force
special fee groups, who do not compete
with candidates tor votes, to vie with them
lot precious banner space.
Surely campaigning must lx- regulated
to protect our public spates. As a tempo
rary solution, if equal access to space for
this campaign is in question, let 's construct
new physical areas dedicated to an election
conversation. What about erecting a tem
porary wall in White Plaza where each

group (and individual) could post infor
mation about their at ti\ ities and mission?
In the long run, the question of space
for candidates and special fee groups
needs to be addressed. We shouldn't limit
ourselves to sound bytes and color copies
when there is a message to be heard alxmt
student organizations — their work, vi
sion and hope — whose impact reaches
fat beyond the Stanford communit\ and
de| H'nds entireh on student support

Elections Commission 'not in a position to
speculate on the impact of specific
campaigning approaches'
1 was disappointed to read the com
ments of |osh llurwit and |oe Narens in
both I he Daily's April (» article. "Cam
paign fliering contusion turns costly for
many tee requests." and their April 9 let
ter to the editor. Their t onuuents indicate
that the Elections Commission's incorrect
announcement of the campaign start
date, and the subsequent disadvantage it
gave several groups with respect to flier
ing. will have no effect on the election out
come. To recap, the Campaign Practice
('.ode mistakenly publicized the campaign
start date as. "Tuesday, April 2. at 12:01
a.m.," when, in fact, it had meant lues

day, April S.
As ,i result, several groups inadvertant-
Iv jumped the gun and posted their cam
paign materials a dav earlv. on Monday,
April 'J, effectively covering the prized
public areas of campus, such as the ('.law,
kiosks and bulletin boards. This left other
groups who had dutifulh waited for the
correct campaign start date in the lurch,
resigning them to posting theii fliers in
areas such as the benches adjacent to the
(.law (where they were subsequently re
moved a day later).
I disagree with Hurwit and Narens's
belief that "having a hundred fliers on the
( law <»r having none will not change the
election outcome." First, 1 don't feel that
anyone, even an elections commissioner,
is in .t position to spec ulate on the impact
of spec ific c ampaigning approaches or the
choices of a group or candidate to cam
paign in the way tliev choose. Second, tor
new groups, such as ours, which are re
questing a special fee for the first time, vis
ibility is the most important aspect of in
forming the voting community of Our ex
istence and signitic atice.
Fliers remain one of the most direct
ways to a< hieve that visibility. This option
was effectively taken from us by the Flec
tions (loin mission's error. My request to
allow our group and other affec ted groups
to repost our fliers on these benches could
not be granted, as these areas are appar
enth off-limits, although tlicv were never
expresslv descrilied .is siwli (and I recall
these areas being utilized m prc\ ions ele( -
lions). It is interesting to note, however,
that several of the postei sand fliers put up
a day earl) still remain, although the\ are
in c leal 1\ prohibited are. is sue li as the walls
in front of the ()ld I nion.
As of vesterdav, I would estimate that
'.•() percent of the publi( l\ posted flieis foi
our group, the Stanford Martial Arts Pro
gram, have been removed. I bis is ,i dire( t
result of t lit' mistake made In the He( tioiis
( oinmission, a mistake that the\ appar
ently don't feel makes a difference to the
results of the election.
While n still remains to be seen w hat iin
pad this mistake ma\ have had, wli.it i
clear to me is that the campaigning fbi till
war's ASS I elections tin ned out to be u
fiiir for several groups that plaved In uc

was unable to do am thing to help 11>sc

Class of 2003 presidents not
just 'party planners'
I his lettei is in response to I be Daib
editorial printed \pril ("It's time to re
evaluate the role of (lass presidents"). I bis
article states that (lass presidents must
inoNe beyond tlieii conventional roles as
"pat I \ planneis' and "must realize that.
Insi .md Ibremost, tlie\ are representa

( oik ems to address and input to elicit. I
would like to point out that the othci
sophomore (l.tss presidents and I .ilw.ins
have the "class-spec ifu interests of sopho
more sin inind when planning am event
fbi the ( l.iss of 2003.
While out priinaiN goal as i lass presi
dents is, and has been, to maintain and in
c lease t lass units, we lia\c gone bevoiul

the traditional means of achieving this, as
have the presidents of both the junioi and
senior classes.
1 be editorial accuses class presidents
of neglecting their central role as being
representatives who serve c lass-spec ific
interests. 1 he same editorial points out
that the senior class presidents planned
not onh sik li social events as Senior Tub
\ iglits, but also career forums "w here se
niors (.m meet alumni working in differ
ent fields." Fliis clearly shows that the se
nior (lass presidents have taken then
constituents' needs of networking with
alumni into consideration when plan
ning events. Similarly, the junioi (lass
presidents, in conjutu tion with the Stan
ford Alumni Network, planned "( arecr
Night" during winter quarter in Nvhich
students could meet Nvitli alumni in vari
ous fields.
I'he articles further states that, "If
sophomores are struggling to choose a
major, their (lass presidents owe it to the
dass to organize forums to meet facultN
and find out about various departments."
We, as sophomore (lass presidents, have
alrcadN done just that. On Otl. 17. we
planned an event in which sophomores
(ould get a bead start on choosing a major
l)N talking to one of the 2 I majors repre
sented that night, going to the ( areer I >e
velopinent ('.enter to get au earb start on
searching for an internship and visiting
theotli( esol the I ndergraduate Advising
Center, Overseas Studies Program and
I ndergraduate Research Opportunities
to gel advising information. More than
100 sophomores attended this event.
During winter quarter, Nve planned
three Academic Dinners. I hese dinners al
lowed undeclared sophomores to have

dinner with a prolessoi and a recent alutn
nns in his oi liei prospective major. 11 us
loriim allowed sophomores to have ques
tions answered about their intended majoi
at Stanford and its possible lareei oppoi
(unities hevond graduation. More than
aOO sopliomoi es attended these dinners.
Moreover. we are in constant contact
with the 1 ndci graduate Senate relaxing
the needs and concerns ot the sophomore
(lass. We sent an e-mail to the t lass asking
them to voice their concerns so that we
could take them to a partic tilai Senate
meeting, \earh one out ot e\er\ ten
sophomores responded with concerns,
and we brought tortli all ot these concerns
at the following senate meeting. 1 urthei
more, we have represented the sopho
more i lass at vai ions meetings line mghout
the vear, inc hiding meetings with I nivei

Class of 2003 presidents not
just 'party planners'
I his lettei is in response to I be Daib
editorial printed \pril ("It's time to re
evaluate the role of (lass presidents"). I bis
article states that (lass presidents must
inoNe beyond tlieii conventional roles as
"pat I \ planneis' and "must realize that.
Insi .md Ibremost, tlie\ are representa

( oik ems to address and input to elicit. I
would like to point out that the othci
sophomore (l.tss presidents and I .ilw.ins
have the "class-spec ifu interests of sopho
more sin inind when planning am event
fbi the ( l.iss of 2003.
While out priinaiN goal as i lass presi
dents is, and has been, to maintain and in
c lease t lass units, we lia\c gone bevoiul

the traditional means of achieving this, as
have the presidents of both the junioi and
senior classes.
1 be editorial accuses class presidents
of neglecting their central role as being
representatives who serve c lass-spec ific
interests. 1 he same editorial points out
that the senior class presidents planned
not onh sik li social events as Senior Tub
\ iglits, but also career forums "w here se
niors (.m meet alumni working in differ
ent fields." Fliis clearly shows that the se
nior (lass presidents have taken then
constituents' needs of networking with
alumni into consideration when plan
ning events. Similarly, the junioi (lass
presidents, in conjutu tion with the Stan
ford Alumni Network, planned "( arecr
Night" during winter quarter in Nvhich
students could meet Nvitli alumni in vari
ous fields.
I'he articles further states that, "If
sophomores are struggling to choose a
major, their (lass presidents owe it to the
dass to organize forums to meet facultN
and find out about various departments."
We, as sophomore (lass presidents, have
alrcadN done just that. On Otl. 17. we
planned an event in which sophomores
(ould get a bead start on choosing a major
l)N talking to one of the 2 I majors repre
sented that night, going to the ( areer I >e
velopinent ('.enter to get au earb start on
searching for an internship and visiting
theotli( esol the I ndergraduate Advising
Center, Overseas Studies Program and
I ndergraduate Research Opportunities
to gel advising information. More than
100 sophomores attended this event.
During winter quarter, Nve planned
three Academic Dinners. I hese dinners al
lowed undeclared sophomores to have

dinner with a prolessoi and a recent alutn
nns in his oi liei prospective major. 11 us
loriim allowed sophomores to have ques
tions answered about their intended majoi
at Stanford and its possible lareei oppoi
(unities hevond graduation. More than
aOO sopliomoi es attended these dinners.
Moreover. we are in constant contact
with the 1 ndci graduate Senate relaxing
the needs and concerns ot the sophomore
(lass. We sent an e-mail to the t lass asking
them to voice their concerns so that we
could take them to a partic tilai Senate

sophomores responded with concerns,
and we brought tortli all ot these concerns
at the following senate meeting. 1 urthei

University prevents 'critical exchange of

With elections Ihis week, slogans and
blight postci s max add a c olorful splash to

and la< k ol spate have prevented am real
opportunity for student dialogue. Krik
Wong's Apt il ti at tide ("ASM flicringcon

student groups following ASM guidelines
were left with no spate for fliering on the
first da\ of campaigning. As Wong report
ed, when the (loek lower rung out mid
night on the first Monda\ ol the quarter,
students armed with masking tape scram
bled to find spate to share information
about iheii programs.
A campaign, after .ill, is a grand old ef
foi t at education — getting a message out.
Sadly, Stanford shuns this critical ex
change of ideas. In relegating campaign
space to the outer Claw facade, bulletin
area and a few wooden bollards, the I ni
versity and Flections Commission force
special fee groups, who do not compete
with candidates tor votes, to vie with them
lot precious banner space.
Surely campaigning must lx- regulated
to protect our public spates. As a tempo
rary solution, if equal access to space for
this campaign is in question, let 's construct
new physical areas dedicated to an election
conversation. What about erecting a tem
porary wall in White Plaza where each

group (and individual) could post infor
mation about their at ti\ ities and mission?
In the long run, the question of space
for candidates and special fee groups
needs to be addressed. We shouldn't limit
ourselves to sound bytes and color copies
when there is a message to be heard alxmt
student organizations — their work, vi
sion and hope — whose impact reaches

Elections Commission 'not in a position to
speculate on the impact of specific
campaigning approaches'
1 was disappointed to read the com
ments of |osh llurwit and |oe Narens in
both I he Daily's April (» article. "Cam
paign fliering contusion turns costly for
many tee requests." and their April 9 let
ter to the editor. Their t onuuents indicate
that the Elections Commission's incorrect
announcement of the campaign start
date, and the subsequent disadvantage it
gave several groups with respect to flier
ing. will have no effect on the election out
come. To recap, the Campaign Practice
('.ode mistakenly publicized the campaign
start date as. "Tuesday, April 2. at 12:01
a.m.," when, in fact, it had meant lues

day, April S.
As ,i result, several groups inadvertant-
Iv jumped the gun and posted their cam
paign materials a dav earlv. on Monday,
April 'J, effectively covering the prized
public areas of campus, such as the ('.law,
kiosks and bulletin boards. This left other
groups who had dutifulh waited for the
correct campaign start date in the lurch,
resigning them to posting theii fliers in
areas such as the benches adjacent to the
(.law (where they were subsequently re
moved a day later).
I disagree with Hurwit and Narens's
belief that "having a hundred fliers on the
( law <»r having none will not change the
election outcome." First, 1 don't feel that
anyone, even an elections commissioner,
is in .t position to spec ulate on the impact
of spec ific c ampaigning approaches or the
choices of a group or candidate to cam
paign in the way tliev choose. Second, tor
new groups, such as ours, which are re
questing a special fee for the first time, vis
ibility is the most important aspect of in
forming the voting community of Our ex
istence and signitic atice.
Fliers remain one of the most direct
ways to a< hieve that visibility. This option
was effectively taken from us by the Flec
tions (loin mission's error. My request to
allow our group and other affec ted groups
to repost our fliers on these benches could
not be granted, as these areas are appar
enth off-limits, although tlicv were never

University prevents 'critical exchange of

With elections Ihis week, slogans and

A campaign, after .ill, is a grand old ef
foi t at education — getting a message out.
Sadly, Stanford shuns this critical ex
change of ideas. In relegating campaign
space to the outer Claw facade, bulletin
area and a few wooden bollards, the I ni
versity and Flections Commission force
special fee groups, who do not compete
with candidates tor votes, to vie with them
lot precious banner space.
Surely campaigning must lx- regulated
to protect our public spates. As a tempo
rary solution, if equal access to space for
this campaign is in question, let 's construct
new physical areas dedicated to an election
conversation. What about erecting a tem
porary wall in White Plaza where each

group (and individual) could post infor
mation about their at ti\ ities and mission?
In the long run, the question of space
for candidates and special fee groups
needs to be addressed. We shouldn't limit
ourselves to sound bytes and color copies
when there is a message to be heard alxmt
student organizations — their work, vi

Elections Commission 'not in a position to
speculate on the impact of specific
campaigning approaches'
1 was disappointed to read the com
ments of |osh llurwit and |oe Narens in
both I he Daily's April (» article. "Cam
paign fliering contusion turns costly for
many tee requests." and their April 9 let
ter to the editor. Their t onuuents indicate
that the Elections Commission's incorrect
announcement of the campaign start
date, and the subsequent disadvantage it
gave several groups with respect to flier
ing. will have no effect on the election out
come. To recap, the Campaign Practice
('.ode mistakenly publicized the campaign
start date as. "Tuesday, April 2. at 12:01
a.m.," when, in fact, it had meant lues

day, April S.
As ,i result, several groups inadvertant-
Iv jumped the gun and posted their cam
paign materials a dav earlv. on Monday,
April 'J, effectively covering the prized
public areas of campus, such as the ('.law,
kiosks and bulletin boards. This left other
groups who had dutifulh waited for the
correct campaign start date in the lurch,
resigning them to posting theii fliers in
areas such as the benches adjacent to the
(.law (where they were subsequently re
moved a day later).
I disagree with Hurwit and Narens's
belief that "having a hundred fliers on the
( law <»r having none will not change the
election outcome." First, 1 don't feel that
anyone, even an elections commissioner,
is in .t position to spec ulate on the impact
of spec ific c ampaigning approaches or the
choices of a group or candidate to cam
paign in the way tliev choose. Second, tor
new groups, such as ours, which are re
questing a special fee for the first time, vis
ibility is the most important aspect of in
forming the voting community of Our ex
istence and signitic atice.
Fliers remain one of the most direct
ways to a< hieve that visibility. This option
was effectively taken from us by the Flec
tions (loin mission's error. My request to
allow our group and other affec ted groups
to repost our fliers on these benches could
not be granted, as these areas are appar
enth off-limits, although tlicv were never
expresslv descrilied .is siwli (and I recall
these areas being utilized m prc\ ions ele( -
lions). It is interesting to note, however,
that several of the postei sand fliers put up
a day earl) still remain, although the\ are
in c leal 1\ prohibited are. is sue li as the walls
