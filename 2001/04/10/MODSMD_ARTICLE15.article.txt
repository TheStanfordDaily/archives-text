University prevents 'critical exchange of
ideas' by limiting fliering space
With elections Ihis week, slogans and
blight postci s max add a c olorful splash to
eanipiis. hut (on fusion alxnit tin- start time
and la< k ol spate have prevented am real
opportunity for student dialogue. Krik
Wong's Apt il ti at tide ("ASM flicringcon
liision turns costly tor some fee cam
paigns") aeeuratelv portraved how mam
student groups following ASM guidelines
were left with no spate for fliering on the
first da\ of campaigning. As Wong report
ed, when the (loek lower rung out mid
night on the first Monda\ ol the quarter,
students armed with masking tape scram
bled to find spate to share information
about iheii programs.
A campaign, after .ill, is a grand old ef
foi t at education — getting a message out.
Sadly, Stanford shuns this critical ex
change of ideas. In relegating campaign
space to the outer Claw facade, bulletin
area and a few wooden bollards, the I ni
versity and Flections Commission force
special fee groups, who do not compete
with candidates tor votes, to vie with them
lot precious banner space.
Surely campaigning must lx- regulated
to protect our public spates. As a tempo
rary solution, if equal access to space for
this campaign is in question, let 's construct
new physical areas dedicated to an election
conversation. What about erecting a tem
porary wall in White Plaza where each

group (and individual) could post infor
mation about their at ti\ ities and mission?
In the long run, the question of space
for candidates and special fee groups
needs to be addressed. We shouldn't limit
ourselves to sound bytes and color copies
when there is a message to be heard alxmt
student organizations — their work, vi
sion and hope — whose impact reaches
fat beyond the Stanford communit\ and
de| H'nds entireh on student support
through special fees.

Elections Commission 'not in a position to
speculate on the impact of specific
campaigning approaches'
1 was disappointed to read the com
ments of |osh llurwit and |oe Narens in
both I he Daily's April (» article. "Cam
paign fliering contusion turns costly for
many tee requests." and their April 9 let
ter to the editor. Their t onuuents indicate
that the Elections Commission's incorrect
announcement of the campaign start
date, and the subsequent disadvantage it
gave several groups with respect to flier
ing. will have no effect on the election out
come. To recap, the Campaign Practice
('.ode mistakenly publicized the campaign
start date as. "Tuesday, April 2. at 12:01
a.m.," when, in fact, it had meant lues

day, April S.
As ,i result, several groups inadvertant-
Iv jumped the gun and posted their cam
paign materials a dav earlv. on Monday,
April 'J, effectively covering the prized
public areas of campus, such as the ('.law,
kiosks and bulletin boards. This left other
groups who had dutifulh waited for the
correct campaign start date in the lurch,
resigning them to posting theii fliers in
areas such as the benches adjacent to the
(.law (where they were subsequently re
moved a day later).
I disagree with Hurwit and Narens's
belief that "having a hundred fliers on the
( law <»r having none will not change the
election outcome." First, 1 don't feel that
anyone, even an elections commissioner,
is in .t position to spec ulate on the impact
of spec ific c ampaigning approaches or the
choices of a group or candidate to cam
paign in the way tliev choose. Second, tor
new groups, such as ours, which are re
questing a special fee for the first time, vis
ibility is the most important aspect of in
forming the voting community of Our ex
istence and signitic atice.
Fliers remain one of the most direct
ways to a< hieve that visibility. This option
was effectively taken from us by the Flec
tions (loin mission's error. My request to
allow our group and other affec ted groups
to repost our fliers on these benches could
not be granted, as these areas are appar
