"\inet\ -live percent of the time, I uot a hi.ink

stare," Barton retails. "Sometimes they said.
" I he ASM hinds my student group.'"
Based largelvon thissurvev, Barton and Kstra
ti, i created a campaign based t>n three themes: at -
countahilitv, relevant'v antl communitv.
I hese (andidates say that the ASS I needs to
become more accountable It> the students it
serves.
"Kat h vc.ir, people campaign on a platform ol
act ountahilitN. and eat h vear there is no change
in at tountahilitv, Barttm said.
I o betome accountable, Barton and Kstra
da plan to bet tune more invt)lved with students
oil tampus. lo better know their fellow stu
dents and those students' concerns, the\ sa\
the\ will attend a house meeting in even dor
mitoiA on campus.
In atlditittn to house meetings, thev will ac
quaint themselves with various student groups
on t ampus In \ isiting these groups' meetings.
Barton and Kstrada also plan to publish a bi
weekh rept >i t on their work in offite. I he candi
dates are even considering a streaming video
t aincra <m the Web so that students nia\ tliret I
l\ monitor their progress.
I he candidates hope to create a stronger
sense o! communis b\ working with stutleni
groups and encouraging these groups to iuter.u t
with each other.
Bartt)ii sa\ s th.it he and Ksiratla will do.i lot of
what (in lent ASM President Sctli Newton and
\'ice President Malia \ illegas did, "but we will
streamline it.
()nc of then ideas is to bring stutlent groups
t losci together. B\ promoting open dialogues
among groups that have strough diUcring be
liefs, whit lit realcs the potential foi conflict. Bar
ton and I sii.ul.i hope to ease potential tensions

t>ii campus before llie\ manifest m negative
wavs. I hese tlialt igues will also give st tide'its uho

each other.
I liev also plan to re.u h main stutleni groups

Barton and I strati.i s.i\ the\ hope to enttnn
age more people to take an interest in student
government. I he\ intend to aitomplish this
goal h\ modilving the town hall meeting. In
order to encourage more people than the nsii.il
core group of students to attend meetings, B.n -
ton and Kstratl.l plan to move town hall meetings
around campus so that the\ are more conve
nient and more at (cssiblc to all students.
I hc\ seek to create a sense ofYonununitv In
improving transportation with a single permit
for all parking areas. Barton, who was plated
in the Sharon (.recn apartments aftei an over
seas sta\ in Santiago, retcnth receixed a ticket
while visiting a friend because lie didn't have
the 11meet parking permit. Although the Mar
guerite was a viable alternative, both he and
Kstrada feel thai the Marguerite isn't .is cflc(
live as driving because it needs expanded
houi s ,ui(| destinations.
Barton and I i,i< l.i also plan to make sure
that othei people on campus work to improve
the sense ol communitv. Part ol (licit platform
entails holding the administration to its commit

zation in new ways.
"The ASS I t an serve a social
function," Barton said. Fothisend.
the candidates plan to establish
Cardinalpaloo/a. a new day-long
event celebrating the beginning of
fall quarter. While such an event
would create a new soci.il event for
students, it would also give them a
new tradition to associate with
Stanford.

stall heat lamps outside the Coffee
House so that students can contin
ue to meet there in the winter.,
when it is colder.
Barton and Estrada promise to
work with class presidents and
other student groups to plan social
events th.it will involve different
classes and interests.
While improving the ASS Is so
cial side. Barton and Estrada sav

tliev will also focus on more acade
mic issues by extending current li
brary hours until 2 a.m., which Bar
ton describes as "taking the idea of
Stanford After Midnight and mak
ing it more relevant."
I he candidates sav they will also
redesign the ASSI Web site so that
it can "act .is viable student page
with current events."

graduate students, who account tor
more than half of Stanford's stu
dent population. So that graduate
students can meet each other and
develop a sense of community, Bar
ton and Estrada plan to hold an ori
entation at the beginning of the
vear. They say they will also im
prove graduate student life bv sup
porting increased stipends and
health insurance, as well as afford
able housing.
