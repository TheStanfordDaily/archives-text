I o begin, these candidates
point to the f.ut that student
groups on campus are separated
from each other. Although ihe\
appreciate the diversih that these
groups offer. Wolfe describes the
( un cut situation as "splintered.
According to (heir platform,
W olfe and Shankai "believe Stan
lord students lac k a sense of a larg
et school-wide conununitv. vital
both to the I niveisit\ and to the
individual Stanford student."
"What could be better is if we
could bring these ni< lies together."
Wolfe said. " I he ( real ion of a true
Stanford communit\ would bring
students together, promote the dif
fusion of ideas, provide new social
opportunities, generate an air of ex
citement on campus that Stanford

Along with housing. Wolfe and

traffic situation on campus. I lie

vice president and president, are running on a platform of community, com

tost of insuring dependents.
Other ideas to improve the
Stanford community include
events to bring students from dif
ferent classes and interests to
gether. Last year, Wolfe and
Shankar created the War of the
Classes: Three on I hree Uasket
hall Jam, in which students from
different classes formed teams
and played each other. If elec ted,
they plan to start a variety of new
programs, including a Stanford
Star Search. With the help of the
Stanford Concert Network.. the\
also plan to revitali/e Frost Am
phitheater.
Ihey hope to make the Stan
ford communit\ safer by adding
A IMs and campus phones in more
convenient locations. Currently,
street lighting exists mcstlv 111
newh renovated buildings. How
ever, these sti m tutes are .ill locat
ed on the outskirts of campus,
meaning that the new lighting re
in.tins unused while pedestrians
are forced to walk along darker
roads. Wolfe and Shankar plan to
bring lighting to more commonly
traveled paths.
Wolfe and Shankar also hope to
promote etlic ienc \ within the Stan
ford community. 1 heir bike distri
bution program aims to take bike s
that are abandoned b\ seniors and
redistribute them to students who
need them.
Hie candidates sax tlie\ will fos

When Wolfe was student boch
president of nearb\ 1 .os Altos I
School, he enacted .1 similar, .suc
cessful program.
1 o further allow students to use
their Stanford Communit\ Cards
and to strengthen bonds between
Stanford students and the sin
rounding community, Wolfe and
Shankar plan to expand Mar
guerite service in downtown Palo

Alto, especially on weekends.
I lie candidates sav that that
communication, the second part of
tlie COMMie platform, will help
build .1 sense of'community on cam
pus. Added communication will
also help keep students informed so
that tliev can voice their opinions
and become agents of change.
Wolfe and Shankar also plan to
create a single Web site that will
contain relevant news tor Stanford
students, such as information 011-
lec tines, concerts and parties. Hie
Web site will be supplemented by
revitalized kiosks and electronic
si tolling news-tickers around cam
pus. particularly in White Pla/a.
1 lie two c andidates also hope to
increase communication within
Stanford. In their vear as junior
class presidents, Wolfe and
Shankar created a c lass council tor
the junior class. With the exception
of the frosh council, which is re
quired bv the administration, this
c lass counc il wa» the first organiza
tion of its kind 111 Stanford student
government. Wolfe and Shankar
plan to create such a council tor
each of the classes. Along with rep
resentatives from the various grad
uate schools and the ASS I presi
dent. the presidents of each class
counc il will meet to form a Counc il
of Presidents. Ibis council will
meet even month and then pass is
sues on to I lie ASS I .
Hie candidates sav that sue li a
class council makes student govern
ment much more approachable.
"It's scan to come to the floor of the
Senate." Wolfe said. "It's much nicer
to come to an atmosphere of peers."
lo increase communication lx--
tween the ASS I leaders and the
Stanford community, Wolfe and
Shankar also plan to bold a quailer
1\ State of Stanford press conference.
As the last part of their platform,
Wolfe and Shankar affirm their
commitment to the goals of their
platform, concrete and achievable
objectives, action, long-term and
short-term positive change and ac
countability.
" I here's onlv so much vou c an
do in one vear." Wolfe said. "We're
concerned not just with present
time, but with (lie future."
