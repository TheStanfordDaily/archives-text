## 
### NICHOLAS CHAN STAFF WRITER 
In ,i competitive rate tor one <>t
the most powerful student positions
on campus, presidential candidate
Liam Bradv and vice presidential
candidate Andv Moreno have an
unusual platform: they don't plan
to win.
Rather than running for the vic
torv, these two juniors are running
to meet and understand Stanford
students and the issues that concern
them.
"Personally, I chose to run to get
to know the student Ixklv and see
what issues, it any, actually concern
Stanford students," Moreno said.
Along these lines, Brady and
Moreno won't lx- putting up any
fliers or attempting any other highly
visible publicitv stunts. Instead, they

will rch on the support of their al
readv established friends and new
people that the\ meet individually
during the campaign.
"We believe the ke\ to success is
one-on-oue interaction, so. while
von ma\ not have heard of ns pub
licly, if von talk to us on a personal
basis, von w ill see that vour views will
become our views." Moreno said.
According to the two candidates,
less publicitv is less intrusive and
more efficient toi voters who are al
ready besieged In fliers. 11 lev also
sav that students are not interested
in leading fliers, whit li will end up in
a trash t an or littering campus.
"In the spirit of sa\ing resources
and giving the students what tliev
want, we have divided not to flier
the campus," Moreno explained.
"From what we have seen, the stu
dents don't want fliers and are tired

of a littered (ampus."
Despite their low-key campaign
approach, Bradv and Moreno do
have strong political view points on
main important and relevant issues.
An Knglish major, Brad\ is con
cerned with the role of the humani
ties on thetei hnologk allv advancing
Stanford campus.
I personalh have strong pas
sions tortile humanities and, as a sin
gle-issue candidate, mv primary
concern is that thev stay strong,"
Brady said.
1 he language department merg
er is a notable current issue that
Brad\ savs wonies him.
" I lie pro|K)sed combination Â«>f
the Spanish and other languages de
partments was rather tumbling to
me," he said.
Bradv and Moreno sav that the
ASSI needs to refix us its attention

011 what students reallv want.
"1 believe that the ASSU, allx it
not intentionally, tends to address is
sues that the students don't care
about simply to stav busy and feel
that they're magnifying their office,"
Moreno said.
Brady and Moreno lx>th bring
e\|x*rience to their campaign.
Moreno is a political science
major and spent last summer work
ing <>n the 1 exas State Finance C iom
mittee in Austin, Texas.
Brady jierfbrms with the Simps
and has been in a few plays.
And. despite their unusual atti
tude towards winning, these candi
dates do care about students.
I believe that, if we address the is
sues that the students care alx nit, we
can save a lot of resources and get to
what the students reallv want,"
Moreno said.
