## ASSU executives generally satisfied with their accomplishments 
### NICHOLAS CHAN STAFF WRITER 
One year ago today, Setli Newton and
Malia Villegas were running tin the ASSI
presidency and vice presidency. After their
year in office, thev sa\ thev have accom
plished mam ot the goals of their plattorm.
Rather than choosing to run, Newton and
Villegas were nominated bv a group ot stu
dents with similar interests.
"It was a yery collective process in whieh
we were nominated In a group." Villegas
recalled.
Newton and Villegas's plattorm consisted
ot tour main points. Their goals were to in
crease the power ot students, to address is
sues ot social responsibility, to activelv piÂ«>-
mote duel sit\ and to emphasize the need toi
increased act ountabilitv and transparent \ <>t
the ASSU.
Main of the events that happened under
Newton and Villegas's term fell nuclei the
category of increasing the power ot students.
Student Initiated ('.nurses, a new ASSI
program introduced this quarter, is ,i ieicut
example of this student empowei ment. s|(
allows students to create and i ai 1 \ out then
own courses with a facultv sponsot lot the
benefit ot other students.
"It's about students creating the kind of
education the) want." Villegas said.
Part ot Newton and Villegas's platform
last year was to put a student on the board <>t
1 rustees. While the board is hesitant to install
a student, the\ have been open to the idea ot
a recent graduate on the board.
In a step towards integrating student
groups, at the beginning of wintet quarter,
the ASSI held a student-leader dinnei at
which leaders from various student organiza
tions met and exc hanged ideas.

Sophomore kahdeidra Martin, former
editor of the Enigma literary magazine, said
she telt it was a beneficial experience.
"It was ver\ helpful to meet with people
who are going through the same things with
trying to get funding for the publication, tr\ -
ing to assess what the readership was and the
response was to our publication," Martin
said. "A lot of good ideas were exchanged
there."
Newton also spoke about "bringing stu
dents to the decision-making table." W hen
the I nivcrsitv decided toend the grapes boy
cott, Newton and Villegas were asked for
their opinion. Rather than directlv consent
ing or disagreeing, the president and vice
president called in representatives from
MKC.hA. a ( hit ant) Latino student organi
zation, who were more involved and in
formed about the issue.
"While that didn't go over super well [with
the I niversitv], they were thankful to have
been at that table because they should have
been at that table," Newton said.
1 he end ol the grapes boycott relates also
to Newton and Villegas's goal of increasing
sot ial responsibility.
I t) that end, Newton and Villegas began
working with the Haas ('.enter to improve
and develop relations between students and
the t enter. 1 hey aie currently drawing up a
Service I.earning Code of Conduct that is
being discussed among several service
groups this quarter.
"Partnerships with [the I laas (.enter] have
been t i nt ial," Newton said.
The Student Votci Project, which encour
ages st ntlents tt) vote in local, state and feder
al elet tions. was also t all ied out under New
ton and Villegas.
Reg.ii ding divei sit\, Newton and Villegas
have been strong supporters of the (.011111111-
nitv ( entei Fund. In addition, tliev have
sponsored several diversity-oriented events
such .is Social Eves, which brought artists to
t anipus to express their views on st >cial issues.
Newton and Villegas have also made sev -
eral changes to increase the accountability

and transpai eiu \ <>t t lie Ass I .
Oik* major change was redefining the
role of the Nominations ( ommittcc foi I ni
versii\ posts. While die Nominations ( om
mittee was previousk underused, Newton
and \ illegas sti essed the Nominations C iom
inittee to oversee the creation of each com
mittee and that at least one student must
serve 011 each t ominittee.
I he president and \it t pi esident have also
published the wASSI'p newslettei to inform
the Stanford communit\ of theii actions.
As tliev leave otiu e, Newton and Yillegas sa\
mam of theii accomplishments will continue.
I nlike previous student-created couises.
which were < ut due to lat k of funding, SI(
will continue because 11 is funded l>\ the
ASS I
Newton and Yillegas also hope that pro
grams like the Student Yotei Project .iittl the
student-leadei dinners will continue with the
new AS SI administi ation.
Some of then otliei accomplishments will
also be built upon and expanded in the com
ing years.
Newton and Yillegas have been support
ers of the (!ommuuit\ ('.enter Fund. Al
though the\ delegated the development of
plans fora campus coinmunit\ centei to the
ASSI I ndergraduate Senate, the Senate was
toobusN to thoroughh debate the issue.
Main of the current candidates foi the po
sition of ASSI president and vice president
also list the conmumit\ centei Fund and
otlier conununit\ center-ielated at ti\ itics on
their platforms.
Newton and Yillegas s.i\ the\ .ilso hope
that several issues that tlie\ were unable to
pursue during then term 111 office will be
picked up b\ the next president and vice
president. lliese issues include tenure for
niinorit\ facultx and socioeconomu diversity
among incoming students.
C herall, New ton and Yillegas sa\ tliev feel
the \ear has been siu (essful.
"I've been pushed awa\ from politic s be
cause I don't think uc can repluate what we
did here, Yillegas said.
