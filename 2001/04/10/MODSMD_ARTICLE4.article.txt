held at Stanford for the second year
starting last Friday.
The six-dav conference brings 25
Russian students and 15 American stu

dents together to help further friendh
connections In looking .11 the position of
student activism in both countries.
Demcxratic Partners, in bringing the
students together, hopes to inspire them
to start public-service projects tli.it will
instill grassroots diplomacy. The group
hopesth.it person-to-person interaction
can be effective in places where high
level summits and meetings have tailed.
According to junior Amer Ahmed,
instead of being "a glorified lecture se
ries where Americans tell Russians how
to fix their deintxracv. [the conference]
is a chance for voting, active students to
learn together how to effect change
from the ground up by learning how to
identifv and address needs in their
communities."
I he students attend workshops on
communitv service and activism, stn
dent-group organization, funding, and

student-fac till\ relations.
I he participants also met some dis
tinguished leaders. Former Sen. (iary
Hart addressed the students on I hurs
dav. and, vesterday, former Secretary of
Defense William Perry spoke on public
service at the Institute for Intel national
