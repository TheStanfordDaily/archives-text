Dailv has rated each student group on a 1

groups, the editorial board < loseh exam

group's plans for the upcoming year.
Student groups requesting a sjxtial fee
for the first time were evaluated on their
expected effectiveness and value as set
forth in their pro|X)s.d.sand presentations,
as well as the viabilitv of their plans for the
coming year.
Below is an explanation of the 1 to 5 rat
ing scale that w as used as a c < >mpc>sitc sc < >rc
fora group's effectiveness and value.
5 — Group successfully met all goals set
out during the previous year, has a
strong sense of its constituent \ and an
overarching vision for the organization.
Group's activities are a valuable compo
nent of student life on campus and fulfill
a need that would otherwise go unmet.
Group has a viable plan of activities tor
the coming year and has cleat goals for

improving on itself and putting its funds
to efficient and effective use.
I—(•roup lias successfully fulfilled al
most all goals set during the previous
vear ancl knows whom it is serving.

tion to the Stanford community that
would Ik- missed if absent. Group's plan
for the ii|xoming vear is viable and in
c hides efforts to fulfill unmet goals and
use its funds effectively.
— ('.roup has fulfilled many of its go.ils
and its plan tor the u|xoining vear reflects
an effort to fulfill unmet goals and at hievc
improvement. Group's activities are a
value to the Stanford community.
2 — (iroup has met few of the previous

does not t learh reflect effort to fulfill
unmet goals or does not seem viable.
Group's sense of its constituency is

RETURNING GROUPS
ALTERNATIVE $21,300
SPRING BREAK (U051.09)
3 4 5
ASH has demonstrated .1 marked im
provement m its organization and leader
ship and the changes were apparent in
this year's trips. ASH has increased its pro
gramming to include post-trip wrap-ups,
community outreach to ensure publicity
of its events and better planning. ASH is
currently the only organization on cam
pus that offers community service oppor
tunities over spring break, which is a valu
able service for the community. The
group relies heavily 011 ASSU special fees,
but operates 011 a small budget for the
number of trips and events it conducts
.itid manages these funds very conscious
ly and judiciouslv. The leadership of the
organization is very strong, ensuring at
least another vear of strong growth.
ASIAN AMERICAN $29, 433
STUDENTS (UO $1.51)
ASSOCIATION
23 4 5
AASA is an umbrella organization that
supports more than 10 Asian-Ameri
can organizations through funding
and resources. While AASA conducts
many events across campus, including
talent shows, fashion shows, dances
and meetings, the organization
should attempt to be more proactive
in educating the community at large
about Asian American issues. Because
its constituency is large and diverse.
AASA, as the umbrella, should work
on internal inclusiveness and commu
nity building, which will only
strengthen each of the groups. AASA
makes a conscious and successful at
tempt to raise funds beyond its ASSU

special fee and manages its budget
closely. "I'll is organization is a neces
sary component of campus diversity.
ASSU LEGAL $95,511
COUNSELING (B $2.29)
3
The ASSU Legal Counseling Office has
provided free legal advice to Stanford
students for many years. Although the
LCO cannot represent students in court,
their staff attorneys focus on "preventa
tive law" and will answer questions
about parking tickets, bankruptcy and
divorce, among other common issues.
The service is supported solely through
the special fee, and only a small increase
in funding is requested. This is an ex
tremely useful and important service,
but it is important that LCO staffers
work to publicize the assistance available
to students, as many are unaware of its
existence.
ASSU ONLINE $16,500
COURSE GUIDE (UO $0.85)
123 4 5
Currently in its third year of existence,
the ASSLJ Online Course Guide pro
vides student comments, ratings and
statistics fora variety of classes, as well as
applicable information from the Stan
ford Bulletin and the Time Schedule.
The Course Guide is billed as a one-stop
shopping tool to aid students in choos
ing classes every quarter, and it has the
potential to be a powerful and useful
tool for students needing help picking
classes. However, the Web site currently
lacks updated information for many
classes, and usability has not improved
greatly from last year. The site would
also benefit from the addition of mes
sage boards where students can post in
formation about classes directly without
going through the end-of-quarter evalu

ations process. In addition, the group
relies solely on special fees for its operat
ing budget and should consider other
sources of funding. 1 lie course guide is
a relatively new resource that can help
students choose their classes and plan
their schedules, but there are still some
serious problems of usability and public
ity to work out.
ASSU SPEAKERS $125,222
BUREAU (B $3.00)
, 3
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a stu
dent-run organization that brings in
outside speakers to address the student
body. While it has brought in a wide va
riety of speakers, it must solicit greater
student input and work to bridge the
gap between the many groups on cam
pus. Creativity in the selection of speak
ers is an area that needs to be ad
dressed, as well .is flexibility in meeting
student needs. The organization's lead
ership remains solid, but greater stu
dent involvement is central next year.
BARRIO $22,864.61
ASSISTANCE (UO $1.17)
1 2 v> 4 5
BA has tutored elementary school children
from East Palo Alto for 29 years, and it has
a strong, well-organized program to show
for it. The volunteer tutors expose under
privileged area youth to college life and
coach them to succeed in their academic
studies. 1 he group s budget is meticulous
ly organized. The group provides a way for
students to break out of the Stanford bub
ble by working to form relationships be
tween Stanford students and children in
EPA. BA, by providing stimulating experi
ences for young children who return year
after vear, is an invaluable asset to the Stan
ford community.
