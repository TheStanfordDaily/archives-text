WASHINGTON (AP) — President
George W. Bush tor the first time called
the showdown with China a "stalemate"
vesierdav, lowering expectations for the
release soon of 24 I S. servicemen and
women. Diplomats s.ml the\ had offered
a new formula to free the sp\ plane crew
and were awaiting Beijing's replv.
"Diplomats sometimes take a little
longer than people would like." Bush
s.iid. "1 urge the (Chinese to bring resolu
tion to this issue. It's time for our people
to come home."
f.S. oflic i.ils reported modest behind
the-scenes progress and said Beijing was
mulling the administration s latest pro
posal to end the standoff. Bush was will
ing, the officials said, to express regret for
the I S. plane landing on (Ihinese soil —
ii the gesture would free the crew.
Amid the Hum ot diplomatic activitv.
the president tried tor a second straight
da\ to prepare Americans for the possi
hilit\ of a long standoff. He lias been
under pressure from critics, including
conservative allies, clamoring for action.
This administration is doing even
thing we can to end the stalemate in an ef
ficient wa\. the president said.
I he crew members have been held
since their KP-3E II surveillance plane
collided w itli a (.liinese fighter jet and was
forced to make an emergenc\ landing
April I. Beijing has sought an apologv
and I S. acceptance of blame, but Bush
lias said neither is warranted.
" flie I S. side should apologue," For
eign Ministn spokesman Sun Yuxi said.
However, along with the defiant words,
China extended the I S air crew extra
privileges, including freedom to exercise
in the air-conditioned building where
tlie\ are being detained.
flie Bush team, ft ustrated l>\ the slow
pace of talks, said the fate of the negotia
tions was in Beijing's hands.
Both sides were toe used on drafts of a
proposed I S. letter that — if approved
In Bush and ('.liinese President |iang
/emiti — would be pi esented to China h\
the- I S ambassadoi in.i deal to release
the crew.
flie latest vei sic»n of the lettei express
es the Bush administration's regret for
tlie loss, and presumed death, of the
fighter pilot as well as regret for the sp\
plane landing on Chinese soil without

permission, ac cording to two senior gov
ernment officials w ho spoke on condition
of anon\ mil v.
1 he d» >c uinent s.i\ s the plane was crip
pled In the clash, was living under a
"Mavdav" signal and had to make an
emergencv landing.
Crew members have talked about the
cause ot the crash. Pentagon officials indi
cated, quoting a State Department cable
reporting the pilot said the big tour-en
gine plane was on autopilot. That could
support the administration's contention
that the spv plane was thing straight and
steadv; the Chinese have said it swerved
into their jet.
A State I Jepartment official, also asking
that he not be identified, said U.S. diplo
mats lia\e warned China that thevve
come as fai in negotiations as Bush will
allow —and it's up to Beijing to accept
the deal and end the dispute.
" fins could get resolved verv quicklv.
It could get resolved in a matter of time,"
White House spokesman An Fleischer
said.
Biisli himself said China needs to re
fill ii the c lew .is c|iii( kl \ as possible.
" flie longei this goes, the more likelv
it is that it c ould jeopardi/e relations" be
tween the I Sand China, the president
told reporters during an ()val ()tfice \ isit

with King Abdullah II of Jordan.
Bush and his advisers have signaled
that a lengthy captivity could affect a host
of issues between the two nations, inc hid
ing trade, militarv exchanges, U.S. mili
tary support of China rival Taiwan,
Bush's scheduled trip to Beijing this fall
and U.S. support of China's bid to host
the 2008 Olvmpics.
A drawn-out dispute could c ause politi
cal problems for Bush, ten). Though a new
poll shows that 60 percent of the public ap
proves of the way he is handling the situa
tion. Bush is facing increasing pressure
from both ends of the political spectrum.
Some conservative Republicans, the
core of his election victorv, are accusing
him of coddling China throughout the
standoff.
"I think that tor 10 davs... we have
acted powerless, unclulv passive and in the
process I think we are emboldening the
worst elements of the burcaucracv in Bei
jing while demoralizing our allies in Asia."
said Can Bauer, who ran unsuccessfullv
against Bush in the Ci( )P primaries.
"I think he should be tougher, said
Pli\llls Schlaflv, a conservative activist. "1
don't have am problem with these mes
sages he's sending China, but the onlv
weapon we have is trade with China and
we're not threatening to take that awav."
