An Australian Aborigine woman once said, "II
von have come here to help me, von are wasting
\oiii time. Hut if'vou have come because vour liber
ation is bound up with mine, then let us work to
gether."
1 lie eight Stanford students aud the stall coordi

I he Stanford group was joined by students from
I C-Berkeley, I CLA and l C-Santa Barbara. All
students lived in the same village and worked side
bv side to help reconstruct houses and take down
buildings that suffered in the earthquakes.
"We were thinking about the Australian Aborig
ine woman's quote when we went and hoping to
have our enthusiasm rub off'on the Salvadoran peo
ple and for their qualities to rub oft on us. ()ur mis
sion wasn't onlv to help rebuild their homes, but to
understand how the\ are living." freshman Lizzi
Ifevdemann said.
I lie first Stanford llillel-sponsored Alternative
Spring Bieak trip started as a project to help build
more housing in the south I sulutan region ol Kl
Salvador. After the Jan. lit earthquakes, however,
the trip gained an added sense of urgenta based
upon the need to help rebuild Kl Salvador.
Still, students were realistic. "1 did not go in ex
pecting to save the world," said freshman Philip
Merksamer. "Kven in terms of building houses, I
knew we were unskilled labor and not professionals.
What was important \sas giving people moral sup
port and showing that people in America c are about
what is going on in Kl Salvador."
Sophomore |oanna Levitt also said she wanted to
provide a phvsical. eating presence lor the people.
" The U.S. seems faceless and huge and imperialistic,
but. despite our government policv, there are still
concerned citizens."
Students said that, b\ In ing in the- homes of their
families, eating their food, plaving with the children
and working with the Salvadoran people, they were
able to experience the people's situation.
"I was not expecting to see as much of the bare
minimum impoverished living that 1 saw on the
sides of the roads of some villages we visited." Hev

(Icm.mil said. "People [were] literally living in boxes
or under sheets held up by wooden poles."
1 lie students also had a chance to meet with the
U.S. Ambassador Rose M. Likins and visit the vari
ous significant sights of the capital, San Salvador, on
March 28.
"The most powerful experience was going to San
Salvador," said junior Klana 1 ladar. "The underlying
theme of the day — the bloody clothing of Archbish
op Romero, the drawings of the people suffering
hanging in the church where the seven Jesuits priests
preached before their assassination — reallv brought
it home. I lie events of the civil war and the con se
quences became even more real and disturbing."
1 he smallest country in Central America, El Sal
vador lias historically experienced calamities dis
proportionate to its si/e. When ( ivil war broke out
m 1980. main families became refugees, onlv re
turning to the country after the 1992 peace ac
cords. When they returned, they were given small
plots of land in arbitrary locations throughout the
country.
(audad Romero was created as a result of tins re
settlement. As the rebuilding after the war began in
1998, the country was badly hit In hurricane Mitch.
"Within a decade, they lost familv members in
the civil war. crops during El Nino and hurricane
Mitch, .ind now their homes to an earthquake.
What struck me most was the resilient nature of the
Salvadoran people, tli.it despite losing so much,
they maintained hope and worked to rebuild their
lives," said sophomore Jonathan Neril.
La C.oordinadora del Bajo Lempa v Bahia de
Jiquilisco, a social movement officially organized into
a civil society in 1998, was started partly to rebuild
Salvadoran society after the war, but also as a demo
cratic organ that still seeks to empower the
"campesinos," or rural people, to determine their
own future.
The people of C'.iudad Romero, one of the Nt> vil
lages forming La Cooidinadora, embody the com
munity spirit that was so startling for the Stanford
students.
"The parents never worried where their kids
were," said junior Allison Leidner. "You never
knew who were friends, siblings, relatives — adults
took care of many children. 1 only figured out who
was a part of mv family based on who slept in the
room."
According to Heydemann. the most significant
accomplishment the Stanford students made was to
add to the innate sense of community of the Sal
vadoran people. "When the head of the village was
saving the goodbye speech to us. he wasn't thanking
us for rebuilding their homes, he was thanking us
for being an inspiring, enthusiastic presence in the
community."
