## The 						Stanford Daily New dean choice raises red flag for humanities 
### 
Published Since IS9I

THK RKCENT APPOIN IMKNT of Bio
logical Sciences Prof. Sharon Long to
succeed Malcom Beasley as dean ol the
S( lioolof I Ininanities and Sciences is the
latest in a series of events that have led to concerns
about the future of the humanities at Stanford.
Long, who was selected In University President
John I lennessv and a search committee, is certain
ly qualified for the job, hi it the choice of someone
with a bat kground in biology raises questions alxnil
the I niversitv's conunitinenl to the humanities.
Long has been at Stanford since 1982 and has
won several prestigious prizes in her field. Still, n
seems that, oni e again, the I Diversity is revealing its
ever increasing technological and scientific tenden
cies while pushing aside the arts and humanities.
We have a president who clearh has a techno
logical bat kgronnd. Therefore, other administra
tive positions, especially the dean of humanities

and sciences, should be made to compensate for
this to ensure an equal voice for the humanities
and arts. Ihe selection of John I lennessv, then an
engineering professor, to be University provost
under former President (ierhard Casper, a con
stitutional scholar, was an example of this balance.
Though Provost John Ktcheinendv is a philoso
ph\ professor and complements I lennessv's experi
ence, he has not shown strong vocal support for the
humanities in recent decisions. That said, appoint
ing a humanities professor as dean would have sent
a clear message about the I niversitv's priorities.
Though Long pin ports to support the arts
and Asian I .anguages, t lie choice of someone with
her background sends a strong message to the
students, faculty and alumni. At a I diversity that
claims to offer the best education to those inter
ested in studying engineering and st iences and
Lnglish, this imbalance cannot be tolerated.

Long's appointment is the latest in a string of
decsions that signals the importance of the hu
manities at Stanford. I "his began before spring
break, when I lennessv announced the merger of
five language departments and the (Comparative
1 jterature Department, citing budgetary and fis
cal concerns. I he trend continued with the an
nouncement that the Latin American Studies
program's renewal would be under scrutiny.
These decisions are sending the unmistakeable
message that certain departments in the human
ities are becoming less important. I niversitv ad
ministrators must recognize that the arts and hu
manities departments do not exist as numbers on
a balance sheet.
I lie arts remain dedicated to individuality
and creativity, and the humanities to scholar
ship and research, much like technological
fields. In the middle of the University's current

fund-raising campaign, the humanities may
not draw as much giving as the sciences, but
that doesn't make humanities fields any less
important.
By naming another non-humanities-oriented
professor to such a high-profile administrative posi
tion, the I diversity has signaled its intention not to
keep every department, including the arts and hu
manities, at the same fiscal and symbolic level that
was championed bv former administrations.
The University could do more to improve
its record on the humanities, starting with lis
tening to more students and faculty concern
ing what changes, if any, they want to see in the
departments, as well as who they suggest to
serve in important University positions. II this
were done, certain departments might not feel
ignored or threatened in the face of seeming
indifference on the part of the University.
