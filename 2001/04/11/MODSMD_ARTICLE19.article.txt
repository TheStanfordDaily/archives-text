# LET FRIEDOM RING
## Politics: LA vs. Stanford 
### 
I went home to Los Angeles this week
end thinking I could est ape the elec
tion mania sweeping our campus.
Hol\ pregnant ( had, was I wrong.
From the moment I put down mv hags
and sprawled out on m\ comix non-dor
mitorv-issue bed, it was clear the Los An
geles (it\ elections had invaded mv home.
Banners with catchv slogans and logos
were hanging from the garage. \l\ mom
had replac ed the hath room wallpaper with
colorful fivers touting different candidates.
And my dad stood on the front porch

handing leaflets con
taining platforms and
promises to neighbors
walking their dogs.
Well, not really.
But the only tele
phone messages on mv
home answering ma
chine that had acc muti
lated while I was at
Stanford were from au-

toniated calling services reminding ine to
vote for so-and-so on election dav. And
even time 1 tinned on the I V. commer
cials "paid for In friends of such-and
such." dominated the airwaves.
It seems that April is election time in
the real world (to which 1..A. does be
long, even with Hollvwood and silicone
and all), .is well as on the Farm. Because
Stanford is supposed to prepare us for
that big. si an. unknown existence called
"life after college." let 's see how the ASSI
election scene compares with "real
world" elections. Who has it better. 1..A.
or Stanford?
Yesterdav, tens of thousands of Los An
gelenos rushed to the polls to cast their
votes in a tightlv-contested mavoral rate.
Yesterday, hundreds of Stanford students
procrastinated. Win vote today when it
can wait until tomorrow? Advantage:
Stanford.
In L.A., one candidate, City Council
man Joel W'achs. asserted that .ill of L.A.'s
59 neighborhood libraries should be open
on Sundays. At Stanford, one of the slates.
Chappie editors Cideon Lewis-Kraus and
Jacob Young, demanded an enormous
party with "chips, dip and dancing girls,
boys and animals." Advantage: Stanford.
Smear tactics are rampant in the L.A.
election, with the Los Angeles Times re
porting "an 11 th-hour burst of negative
advertising." At Stanford, negative cam
paigning consists of drawing horns, black
teeth and an evil goatee on the pictures of
opposing candidates. Advantage: L.A,
they're more hardcore.
L.A.'s local television channels run

uotlung hill commercials tor the candi
dates in between the programming. Stan
forcl's only 1 \ channel, SCBN, mns .111
o( c asional movie in between dead .111 lime.
Advantage: Stanford.
I lie candidate with the most inonev
nsnallv wins 111 L.A. 1 lie slate with the
most fliers nsnallv wins at Stanford. Ad
vantage: L.A. (inonev talks; fliers can't
withstand a light drizzle).
The winner in the L.A. mavoral race
gets to put his or her unique stamp on a
(itv of millions. I he win net sin Stanford's
ASSl presidential race gel their own of
fice in I residder. Advantage: L.A.
I he result? L.A., Stanford, 3. Looks
like we're in lot a recount; vou can expect
the results about five weeks from now.
But after examining a sliver of the evi
dence. this much is clear: f lections in the
real world, like Stanford's, are anything
hut perfect. In fact, both can be frustrat
ing, annoy ing and. oftentimes, downright
detestable.
It's easy to get fed up yvith elections in
our society, especially today. 111st six
months ago, the majority of Americans
voted tor one candidate 111 our national
election, only to see the other candidate
yvin and take office. Noyv, the less popular
of the tyvo is our president, having gradu
ated yvith honors from the all-important
"Electoral College." The only people he
has inspired thus far are the creative pro
ducers at Comedy Central (heard about
"That's Nlv Bush!" yet?).
Not surprisingly, the residue of
November's sour events has stuck to vot
ers. I spoke with .1 few people in L.A. yvlio
felt completely disconnected from the
electoral process. I hev simply dec ided not
to vote in the city 's election.
We cannot react the same way. We may
be fliered out. We may feel disenfran
chised. We may not even know the candi
dates' names. But we must vote.
As imperfec t as the elec toral system is at
Stanford and beyond, we lose a funda
mental piece of democracy by choosing
not to participate. If yve don't exercise our
right to vote, we give up the freedom upon
which this nation was founded. Basically,
by refusing to punch that chad ore lick that
mouse, we ignore over two centuries of
struggle.
Learn about the candidates and their
platforms. Dec ide what issues are impor
tant to you. Make an informed choice.
Any thing less would In- so "SoCal."

I went home to Los Angeles this week
end thinking I could est ape the elec
tion mania sweeping our campus.
Hol\ pregnant ( had, was I wrong.
From the moment I put down mv hags
and sprawled out on m\ comix non-dor
mitorv-issue bed, it was clear the Los An
geles (it\ elections had invaded mv home.
Banners with catchv slogans and logos
were hanging from the garage. \l\ mom
had replac ed the hath room wallpaper with
colorful fivers touting different candidates.
And my dad stood on the front porch

handing leaflets con
taining platforms and
promises to neighbors
walking their dogs.
Well, not really.
But the only tele
phone messages on mv
home answering ma
chine that had acc muti
lated while I was at
Stanford were from au-

toniated calling services reminding ine to
vote for so-and-so on election dav. And
even time 1 tinned on the I V. commer
cials "paid for In friends of such-and
such." dominated the airwaves.
It seems that April is election time in
the real world (to which 1..A. does be
long, even with Hollvwood and silicone
and all), .is well as on the Farm. Because
Stanford is supposed to prepare us for
that big. si an. unknown existence called
"life after college." let 's see how the ASSI
election scene compares with "real
world" elections. Who has it better. 1..A.
or Stanford?
Yesterdav, tens of thousands of Los An
gelenos rushed to the polls to cast their
votes in a tightlv-contested mavoral rate.
Yesterday, hundreds of Stanford students
procrastinated. Win vote today when it
can wait until tomorrow? Advantage:
Stanford.
In L.A., one candidate, City Council
man Joel W'achs. asserted that .ill of L.A.'s
59 neighborhood libraries should be open
on Sundays. At Stanford, one of the slates.
Chappie editors Cideon Lewis-Kraus and
Jacob Young, demanded an enormous
party with "chips, dip and dancing girls,
boys and animals." Advantage: Stanford.
Smear tactics are rampant in the L.A.
election, with the Los Angeles Times re
porting "an 11 th-hour burst of negative
advertising." At Stanford, negative cam
paigning consists of drawing horns, black
teeth and an evil goatee on the pictures of
opposing candidates. Advantage: L.A,
they're more hardcore.
L.A.'s local television channels run

uotlung hill commercials tor the candi
dates in between the programming. Stan
forcl's only 1 \ channel, SCBN, mns .111
o( c asional movie in between dead .111 lime.
Advantage: Stanford.
I lie candidate with the most inonev
nsnallv wins 111 L.A. 1 lie slate with the
most fliers nsnallv wins at Stanford. Ad
vantage: L.A. (inonev talks; fliers can't
withstand a light drizzle).
The winner in the L.A. mavoral race
gets to put his or her unique stamp on a
(itv of millions. I he win net sin Stanford's
ASSl presidential race gel their own of
fice in I residder. Advantage: L.A.
I he result? L.A., Stanford, 3. Looks
like we're in lot a recount; vou can expect
the results about five weeks from now.
But after examining a sliver of the evi
dence. this much is clear: f lections in the
real world, like Stanford's, are anything
hut perfect. In fact, both can be frustrat
ing, annoy ing and. oftentimes, downright
detestable.
It's easy to get fed up yvith elections in
our society, especially today. 111st six
months ago, the majority of Americans
voted tor one candidate 111 our national
election, only to see the other candidate
yvin and take office. Noyv, the less popular
of the tyvo is our president, having gradu
ated yvith honors from the all-important
"Electoral College." The only people he
has inspired thus far are the creative pro
ducers at Comedy Central (heard about
"That's Nlv Bush!" yet?).
Not surprisingly, the residue of
November's sour events has stuck to vot
ers. I spoke with .1 few people in L.A. yvlio
felt completely disconnected from the
electoral process. I hev simply dec ided not
to vote in the city 's election.
We cannot react the same way. We may
be fliered out. We may feel disenfran
chised. We may not even know the candi
dates' names. But we must vote.
As imperfec t as the elec toral system is at
Stanford and beyond, we lose a funda

platforms. Dec ide what issues are impor
tant to you. Make an informed choice.
