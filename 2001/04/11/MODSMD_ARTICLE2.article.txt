While special fee requests are a
regular and expec ted part of the
ASSI annual ballot, oppositions to
these requests are generally not
seen on the ballot. I his vear, how
ever, two oppositions were posted:
one against the creation of an Kqual
Klection Fund Ceneral Feeatul the
other against l he Stanford Daily's
re(|uest fbt a special fee.
Ac cording to several memlxrsof
the ASM Flections Commission
and individuals responsible for the
revisions to lhe ASSI Constitution
and ASM Flection Bv-Liws, these
objections are not only entirely
legal, but also able to be posted b\
any student.
Sophomore Henrv rowsner, de
scribed by Flections Commission of
ficials as an expert on the ASSI'
confirmed that the re
visions allowed tor anv student op
posed to .m\ fee request or slate
could submit a petition to the Flec -
tions (oniniission, which would re
view it and subsequently place it on
the ballot.
"It's not .1 regularly-exercised
right, but there is a long-standing
tradition of having these laws in
place," I owsner said. "Thev've
been around tor at least five or six
years."
According to sophomore |cffrev
lx*e, the assistant elections commis
sioner, such a petition is allowed in a
section of the ASSI Flection By-
I xiws which states that" l he name(s)
of the sponsors in favor and op
posed (if anv) to the Special Fee re
quest" can be posted with there

quest. A "sponsor" in this context
can "basically refer to an\ student,"
ac cording to I tarns Shapiro, a do< -
toral student in physics responsible
tor many of the revisions to the
ASSI Constitution.
Although this sec tion of the In
laws .ils« > states that the commission
is required to verity am petition in
opposition. Fee admitted to nevei
having seen this petition before its
publication on the ballot, lie also
said he did not know whv the peti
tion appeared onl\ on the graduate
student ballot and not on the un
dergraduate ballot, since the by
laws govern l>oth ballots.
Junior Diane Bouclalis, special
fees director for the Flections
Commission, said tb.it the opposi

that the Elections Commission
"has no discretion over the posting
of statements."
Flections Commissioner |oe

Fhe petition in opposition to
I'he Dailv's special fee request,

Lnn from Mechanical Fnginenng,
Hunter Fart from the Math De

several points before voting for I lie
I)ail\ s special fee. inc hiding the fact
that "lhe Daily used its influence
among undergrads to destroy the

"[The Daily] systematically op
posed efforts In graduate students
to reclaim the vast streams of gradu
ate ASSI' fee money that were being
diverted to undergraduate groups."

"This was not an official state
ment by the [Graduate Student

Narens said that the (.S( came
to the Flections Commission with
the constitution and discussed the
legality of putting the opposition 011
the ballot, and that he alone then

Lam. Tart and Ranch<xl also
claim in their petition that I he Daily
"d<x*s not serve the needs of the
graduate student community,"
specifically because it does not cover

events like last veafs graduate stu
dent housing lottery, w hen "approx
imately 1.000 people were denied

I'liev write that Ihe Daily "has
survived without student subsidies
tor manv years" and therefore does
not need additional funding "from
even graduate student's paycheck."
According to Ihe Daily's online
statement. "Ihe Daily requested
.md received a special fee every year
until 1005. w hen increasing revenus
allowed the paper to print without
ASSI funds. Ihe derision to begin

upon the financial impact of the re
cent economic downturn."
Lindsey Munro, Ihe Daily's
business manager, said that she had

of the (iSC. alxMit the spec ial fee re
quest. She emphasized that she
tried many times to get in touch with
the (»SC, of which Lun. Tart and
Ranchod are members, in order to
avoid anv problems with the special

"I wrote an e-mail to the CiS('. in
formation e-mail [address] and 110

problems." she said. "With the I n
dergraduate Senate, we s.it down

something was contusing to them,
and I specific all\ asked it Naclira

Klection Fund Ceneral Feeatul the
other against l he Stanford Daily's

Ac cording to several memlxrsof
the ASM Flections Commission

view it and subsequently place it on
the ballot.
"It's not .1 regularly-exercised
right, but there is a long-standing
tradition of having these laws in
