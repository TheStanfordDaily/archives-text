While special fee requests are a
regular and expec ted part of the
ASSI annual ballot, oppositions to
these requests are generally not
seen on the ballot. I his vear, how
ever, two oppositions were posted:
one against the creation of an Kqual
Klection Fund Ceneral Feeatul the
other against l he Stanford Daily's
re(|uest fbt a special fee.
Ac cording to several memlxrsof
the ASM Flections Commission
and individuals responsible for the
revisions to lhe ASSI Constitution
and ASM Flection Bv-Liws, these
objections are not only entirely
legal, but also able to be posted b\
any student.
Sophomore Henrv rowsner, de
scribed by Flections Commission of
ficials as an expert on the ASSI'
confirmed that the re
visions allowed tor anv student op
posed to .m\ fee request or slate
could submit a petition to the Flec -
tions (oniniission, which would re
view it and subsequently place it on
the ballot.
"It's not .1 regularly-exercised
right, but there is a long-standing
tradition of having these laws in
place," I owsner said. "Thev've
been around tor at least five or six
years."
According to sophomore |cffrev
lx*e, the assistant elections commis
sioner, such a petition is allowed in a
section of the ASSI Flection By-
I xiws which states that" l he name(s)
of the sponsors in favor and op
posed (if anv) to the Special Fee re
quest" can be posted with there

quest. A "sponsor" in this context
can "basically refer to an\ student,"
ac cording to I tarns Shapiro, a do< -
toral student in physics responsible
tor many of the revisions to the
ASSI Constitution.
Although this sec tion of the In
laws .ilsÂ« > states that the commission
is required to verity am petition in
opposition. Fee admitted to nevei
having seen this petition before its
publication on the ballot, lie also
said he did not know whv the peti
tion appeared onl\ on the graduate
student ballot and not on the un
dergraduate ballot, since the by
laws govern l>oth ballots.
Junior Diane Bouclalis, special
fees director for the Flections
Commission, said tb.it the opposi
tion petition is constitutional and
that the Elections Commission
"has no discretion over the posting
of statements."
Flections Commissioner |oe
Narens, a junior, s.iid that, while the
Flections Commission does review
statements, only in extreme cases
would it deny the statement .1 place
on the ballot.
Fhe petition in opposition to
I'he Dailv's special fee request,
signed In graduate students King
Lnn from Mechanical Fnginenng,
Hunter Fart from the Math De
partment and law student Sanja\
Kanchcxl, asks students to consider
several points before voting for I lie
I)ail\ s special fee. inc hiding the fact
that "lhe Daily used its influence
among undergrads to destroy the
predecessor to the Craduatc Stu
dent Council."
