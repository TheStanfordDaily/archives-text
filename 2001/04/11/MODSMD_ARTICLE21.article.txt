Daily editorial a 'smear effort'
Last week, after c areful consideration,
the Craduate Student Council voted to
advise graduate students to vote against
1 he Stanford Daily's special fee.
Strangely, Monday's Daily editorial
("CSC representation, elections ineffec
tive") condemning the CSC fora two
vear-old constitutional amendment never
mentioned this fact. I he editorial also de
nies two vcars of enormous progress in
areas important to graduate students.
This editorial looks disturbingly like a
smear effort to disc redit the ClSC's rec
ommendation on Daily funding. As out
lined in detail on the ballot. The Daily's
budget is too bloated, and the paper's in
difference to graduate students too great
to warrant subsidizing it with our hard
earned dollars.

GSC should reform the way it operates
As one of the dissidents within the
Graduate Student Council, I concur with
your bottom-line conclusion that the C»SC
is ineffective. In fact, 1 would say the GSC
is pretty close to useless in some respects.
However, 1 take exception to the specifics
leading up to your conclusion. There was

never a lac k of follow-up on parking issues
or environmentally friendly buildings —
by and large, the CSC refused to address
those issues in the first place. And therein
was the problem.
The leadership of the CSC. decided
that the organization had limited "politi
cal capital" and, therefore, that the CSC
should not address any issues except
those acceptable to the leadership. Am
issue not approved by the leadership
(e.g. parking) was essentially banished
from consideration by the CSC. So some
of us just started working on parking and
other issues on our own rather than
spend our time battling the obstruction
ists in the CSC. But obstructionism was
only part of the problem.
Our leadership did not like the idea of
formalizing policy positions via resolution,
so we almost never adopted a formal posi
tion on any issue. Instead, our method of
action was anarchy: Issues were talked
about ad nauseum until somebody dec id
ed that they were angry enough to go
make some demands of administrator X
about issue Y. But that person couldn't ac
curately represent the CSC., much less our
graduate student constituency, because
the CSC never adopted a formal position
or policy on that issue.
Despite their many faults, there is a rea
son why all legislative bodies — from
Congress to city councils — set forth for
mal procedures for deciding where they
stand on an issue. In it's infinite wisdom.

this year's C.SC decided to take a different
path — that is, anarchy. That said, I've
never doubted the intentions of anvone
on the (iSC . — all our members were well
intentioned, but 1 believe some were in
credibly misguided. Thus, the solution to
the problem is not particularly complicat
ed: Reform the way the (JSC operates
rather than merging it back with the Un
dergraduate Senate. I sincerely hope the
soon-to-be elected (JSC members will do
just that.

GSC 'an effective advocate
for graduate students'
In April 1999, Stanford students over
whelmingly approved a constitutional
amendment called "An ASSl For All
Students, which created separate leg
islative bodies for graduates and under
graduates. \\ ith nearly 88 percent of
those voting in favor, the measure passed
by what may have been the largest mar
gin in ASSU history.
At the time, proponents (including
myself) claimed that the amendment
would enable the two disparate student
populations to be better represented.
Ihe few opponents (The Stanford Dailv
being one of the loudest) asserted it
would undermine graduate student rep
resentation. These claims were repeated
as recently as this week, in .1 Monday ed
itorial ("(■ S( representation, elections in
effective").
The editorial said: "Graduate students
at Stanford face .1 host of problems — in
cluding lac k of housing, childcare,
stipends, health care and pat king — that
require immediate attention . . . Since
separating from the ASSI' I ndergradu
ate Senate 111 1999. the GS(has not made
great strides in achieving its g0a15..."
B\ now. two years have passed since the
amendment was approved, enough time
to see if its critics were right.
By almost am measure, the Graduate
Student ('.ouncil has continued to be an ef
fective advocate for graduate students. To
list some of its accomplishments over the
past two years:
1) Successful advocai \ for 2,000 addi
tional student units in the current Gener
al Use Permit.
2) Kxpansion of the off-campus hous
ing program f'oin 250 spaces to <1 planned
800 bv this coming summer.
3) A direct housing stipend supplement
of $3,300 per vear for 300 graduate stu
dents. starting this summer.
4) Substantial reductions 111 the <ost of
dependent health care for graduate stu
dents with families.
5) I he funding of 03 graduate student
groups, the vast majority of which either
didn't exist or were never funded before
the amendment.
6) Passage of the first graduate student
onlv special tec to support the Graduate
Women's Network.
The record is very clear. Freed from
having to deal with undergraduate-fo
cused issues, the GSG has been very effec -
tive 011 graduate student concerns. So The
Daily's advice to the GSG — to "better
communicate with the Senate on initia
tives to improve student life ... to make
visible, meaningful improvements next
vear" — is divorced from reality.
But win would the opponents of the
amendment continue to misrepresent its
benefits? The simplest explanation is that
thev have not bothered to learn what's
reallv going on in the graduate commu
nity. Ihe Daily seldom sends a reporter
to GSG meetings or prints articles relat
ing to graduate life. It's no surprise that
those at the newspaper are unaware of all
that the GSG has done.
The Stanford community is ill-served

bv this negligence. Graduate students
have little time to address the multitude of
issues facing them, let alone correct such
sloppy journalism. It is time for The Dailv
to accept that, two years ago. it was wrong
to oppose the amendment. It should start
making a serious effort to report on the
graduate communitN for w hic hit profess
es such oc c asional concern.

Daily's assessment
'completely inaccurate'
1 am writing in regard to I lie Daily's
misrepresentation of the Stanford ( lum
ber Chorale in its review of special fee
groups. 1 went in for an interview believ
ing that what 1 said would be listened to
and considered seriously. Instead, 1 was
disappointed to find the 1 eview containing
blatant misinformation, not to mention
what I feel is an unfair assessment of our
role .is .1 group, and what appears to be
outright disregard for the points that 1
stressed in the interview.
I he Daily was completely inaccurate in
stating that the thousands of people who
attend our performances were "mostly
outside of Stanford." As 1 stressed in the
interview, over 00 percent of our audi
ences are Stanford students, a dramatic in
crease from recent vears. The Dailv sug
gests that we need to "put more effort into
increasing [our] campus visibility." How
ever. as 1 stated in the interview, our goal
in recent vears has been just that, and we
have seen great success (out concert atten
dance has increased from 20 percent Stan
ford students to 60 percent Stanford stu
dents in just two years).
Furthermore, we strive to make our
selves heard bv performing at many cam
puswide events, including Commence
ment, University inauguration and Stan
ford Admit Weekend events. I feel that we
are at least as visible .is many student
groups that received higher scores.
More importantly, however, the signif
icance of our group lies not simply in the
number of people who attend our con
certs, but rather in our overall efforts to
promote and improve the highly under
represented arts .it Stanford.
The Daily seemed to disregard some of
the activities we value most, such as re
cruiting more musically talented students
to Stanford and improving Stanford's rep
utation in the arts to an international au
dience. We are one of the few groups on
campus that seems to actively pursue these
goals and I feel that, in de-emphasi/.ing
their importance, The Daily has missed
the point of win we are asking for special

fee in the first place.

SHPRC misidentified on ASSU ballot
At least in Florida thc\ got the candi
dates names right, Ibis morning, we
found that tlu- Sexual Health Peer Re
source ('.enter was misidentified on the
ASSt special lee ballot as the "Stanford
Health Peer Resource ('.enter." Because
our central mission involves the promo
tion <>! sexual health on campus, tins mis
take is potentialh disastrous to out organi
zation's chain es in the election.
ASSI elec lions olfic ials c hanged the bal
lot this afternoon, but people had alread\
been voting for 1 5 hours fora group that no
one has ever heard of. Because we did not
have ac c ess to the ballot until voting started,
there was no wa\ for us to object to the bal
lot beforehand. When we attempted to cor
rect the situation ibis morning, we were told
In an election official. "Most groups are not
passed [for special fee] their liist time
around."
Although we had not been able to look
at the ballot before voting started, we had
been able to request changes to out Klec
tion 112 fandbook entry. ()n the morning of
April 7. we requested that our name be list
ed in the handbook as "SHPRC (Sexual
Health Peer Resource (.enter)." This
change was never enacted.
If the Sexual Health Peer Resource
('.enter is rejected for special fee. we will
be requesting a re-vote, with no quorum
necessarv. In future elections, we hope
that candidates will be given the oppor
tunity to view the ballot before voting
starts.

Election commission
responds to SHPRC letter
While I regret the error. 1 don't believe
that it will make the difference between
the Sexual Health Peer Resource Cen
ter's being approved. I believe that, il the
group is rejected, it will be because it is
new to special fee or because the student
body has deliberately chosen to reject the
SHPRC. for whatever reason — not be
cause of a correctable error. In other
words, I didn't notice the error when I
voted just after midnight, and I sincereh
hope everyone else read over it as well.
As for the call fora re-vote, I think it is

premature, but 1 assure the letter writers
th.it we will look into the constitutional
provisions to find a solution it it becomes
necessary. While I realize it is little conso
lation to your justified pique, if voters were
confused b\ the "Stanford I lealtli Peer Re
source Center" misnomer, they would
have been linked directly to the Sexual
Health I'eei Resource Center's statement
of purpose.
I regret that the group has not given us
11 edit foi corret ting (or attempting to cor
rect) both its personal error when it sub
mitted its online statement and our error
on the online ballot.

University should address
content of hate speech
"Rape all oriental bitches." 1 his, and
Detective Sgt. Rick ripton's claim that
keeping this quiet would spare the feelings
of targeted minorities (San Francisco
( hronicle, April 4, "Stanford cop takes
issue with professoi s hate poll text of racist
graffiti reproduced on net") reflects our
tendenc \ to provide short-term cover-ups
for long-term problems. As an Asian-Amer
ican female. I feel not only threatened and
disgusted In this ac t of racial and sexual ha
tted. but I feel insulted by the University's
denial of our right to know and act on a
problem that directly concerns us as the
Stanford community.
lo maintain the idea of a "diverse"
and health) environment requires that
the I nivcrsity own up to its weaknesses
and expose them to constructive criticism
and change. While the hate crime itself
was committed In an individual, the fail
ure of the I niversitv to open this infor
mation to the public implies that the fate
of diversity is one that can be guised sitn
plv by the mask of ignorance and denial.
Our racial and ethnic coalitions and
women's coalitions on campus exist not to
disrupt the peace of the community, but to
ensure that Stanford lives up to the claims of
being open-minded and sensitive to the
needs of its diverse population. I hev exist to
t eat t to incidents like these and to bring pos
itive change out of otherwise awful situa
tions.
To be given the opportunity to recognize
and remedy existing problems that target
our community is mut h more empowering
and satisfy ing than to live in a feigned world
of uninterrupted order. If we do not know
that hate c rimes still occur or feel how it af
fects those around us, how can we possibly
expect to make progress toward a more
equal and peaceful community?
Informing the entire campus of these

blatantly hateful comments will keep us
from repeatedly sweeping each event
under the rug as an isolated incident; it
w ill also cultivate .1 sense of empathy and
validation to minority struggles while
bringing together both targeted and non
targeted communities toward a common
goal. 1 hope the University will give us .1
chance to act on and inform the commu
nity of issues th.it directlv pertain to our
awareness and growth by trusting that we
will, appropriately and rightfully, react to
the situations .is needed.

Student speaks out against
Commencement speaker
selection process
Consider this .1 response to the alums
who keep lambasting seniors for being eli
tists about our graduation speaker. As
Stanford students, we get lots of things we
don't deserve — hell, .is an ew, 1 think we
are pretty damned spoiled. This is beside
the point.
Of course we deserve a good gradua
tion speech. Mavbe it's too bad that some
of us are disappointed about the choice for
speaker given some of the obvious alterna
tives. Maybe not. In am case, this in my
dose of elitism.
What troubles me as a humanities
major is how careless the < hoice of Fiorina
appears. It's not like a Commencement
speaker is supposed to represent anvone's
interests, but the decision itself must be
cast 111 .» political light. That said, I think
I niversitv President John Hennessy
goofed big time.
His mindfulness of having the chief ex
ecutive officer of Hewlett Packard address
the I niversitv (not just the St 11001 of Engi
neering) is evident in the statement an
nouncing her selection. And, in order to
quell people like me, he made it clear that
she was .1 humanities major at Stanford.
Hut tor crving out loud, couldn't the
Hewlett-Packard-Stanford menage a trots
settle down just for one second? Enough
with the public self-congratulation.
For all that, don't get me wrong. The
last thing I want to do is sell Fiorina short.
I bet her speech will go over just fine, and
we'll walk away proudly with pomp and
circumstance all the same.
1 .1111 immensely grateful for the educa
tion and interactions that have been Stan
ford for me. It's just a bummer that Hen
nessv wasted 110 time in shamclesslv ac
knowledging that all the 50-cent words in
the world don't add up to a diploma from
the Stanford Skills Network, Inc.
