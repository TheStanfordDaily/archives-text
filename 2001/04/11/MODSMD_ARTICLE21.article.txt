Daily editorial a 'smear effort'
Last week, after c areful consideration,
the Craduate Student Council voted to
advise graduate students to vote against
1 he Stanford Daily's special fee.
Strangely, Monday's Daily editorial
("CSC representation, elections ineffec
tive") condemning the CSC fora two
vear-old constitutional amendment never
mentioned this fact. I he editorial also de
nies two vcars of enormous progress in
areas important to graduate students.
This editorial looks disturbingly like a
smear effort to disc redit the ClSC's rec
ommendation on Daily funding. As out
lined in detail on the ballot. The Daily's
budget is too bloated, and the paper's in
difference to graduate students too great
to warrant subsidizing it with our hard
earned dollars.

GSC should reform the way it operates
As one of the dissidents within the
Graduate Student Council, I concur with
your bottom-line conclusion that the C»SC
is ineffective. In fact, 1 would say the GSC
is pretty close to useless in some respects.
However, 1 take exception to the specifics
leading up to your conclusion. There was

never a lac k of follow-up on parking issues
or environmentally friendly buildings —
by and large, the CSC refused to address
those issues in the first place. And therein
was the problem.
The leadership of the CSC. decided
that the organization had limited "politi
cal capital" and, therefore, that the CSC
should not address any issues except
those acceptable to the leadership. Am
issue not approved by the leadership
(e.g. parking) was essentially banished
from consideration by the CSC. So some
of us just started working on parking and
other issues on our own rather than
spend our time battling the obstruction
ists in the CSC. But obstructionism was
only part of the problem.
Our leadership did not like the idea of
formalizing policy positions via resolution,
so we almost never adopted a formal posi
tion on any issue. Instead, our method of
action was anarchy: Issues were talked
about ad nauseum until somebody dec id
ed that they were angry enough to go
make some demands of administrator X
about issue Y. But that person couldn't ac
curately represent the CSC., much less our
graduate student constituency, because
the CSC never adopted a formal position
or policy on that issue.
Despite their many faults, there is a rea
son why all legislative bodies — from
Congress to city councils — set forth for
mal procedures for deciding where they
stand on an issue. In it's infinite wisdom.

this year's C.SC decided to take a different
path — that is, anarchy. That said, I've
never doubted the intentions of anvone
on the (iSC . — all our members were well
intentioned, but 1 believe some were in
credibly misguided. Thus, the solution to
the problem is not particularly complicat
ed: Reform the way the (JSC operates
rather than merging it back with the Un
dergraduate Senate. I sincerely hope the
soon-to-be elected (JSC members will do
just that.

GSC 'an effective advocate
for graduate students'
In April 1999, Stanford students over
whelmingly approved a constitutional
amendment called "An ASSl For All
Students, which created separate leg
islative bodies for graduates and under
graduates. \\ ith nearly 88 percent of
those voting in favor, the measure passed
by what may have been the largest mar
gin in ASSU history.
At the time, proponents (including
myself) claimed that the amendment
would enable the two disparate student
populations to be better represented.
