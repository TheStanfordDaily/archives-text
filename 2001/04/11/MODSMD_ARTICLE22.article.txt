## 2001 ELECTIONS The 						Stanford Daily PRESIDENTIAL ENDORSEMENT 2001 ELECTIONS Daily decides not to endorse any ASSU slate 
### 
PubUthrd Since IH9I

EVERY YEAR, I UK Daily's editorial
board interviews the slates running for
ANSI president and vice president
and, based upon those interviews,
makes an endorsement on election dav. As of
Friday afternoon, this vear was not going to be
any different. W hen the board met again Sun
day, however, our stance had changed.
l lie Daily will not be endorsing anv slate for
ASM president and vice president this vear.
After a weekend of considering the problems
of this year's election and struggling to identify
striking differences between the candidates, the
editorial board members came to the conclusion
that we could not, in good faith, make any con
crete recommendation to the student bodv
about this year's slates or the election in gener
al. I he lack of anv real checks on the election —
such as. for instance, measures that would en
sure a fair election and establish some recourse
for candidates with concerns — and the com
plete absence of good publicity also added to
our skepticism.
Though, in our interviews, it emerged that the
Brewer / (lordero and Wolfe / Shankar slates
were, in fact, the strongest, both seemed to be ad
dressing largeh the same issues and had identifi
able weaknesses that concerned us.
With this in mind, we will outline the areas of

process and policv that struck us as most impor
tant, highlighting also where the two slates
stand in these realms.
Continuity and specificitv stood out to us as
the two areas most often neglected or misun
derstood in ASSU leadership. All the slates
stressed balancing the improvements in stu
dent life th.il characterized the Levin Mills ad
ministration of last year with the strides in ad
vocacy stressed In the current Newton / Yille
gas administration.
However, despite this stated goal, neither
slate demonstrated a viable plan for achieving
this balance. Though Brewer and (lordero em
phasized their commitment to continuitv and
advocacy — Brewer having been involved in
this vear's ASSL efforts in this area— their
platform lacked the specific it\ necessan to ef
fect anv real change in the short one-vcar term.
B\ contrast, Wolfe and Shankar's platform
showed a commitment to delivering results —
and had the research to support that — but
their knowledge of advocac\ issues, particular
ly those of diversity and student voice, left
much to be desired.
Beyond this fundamental difference, the two
slates used many of the same buzz words— ones
like "accountability'" and "community" — to tell
us what we already knew. Yes, the ASSI should

he more accountable. Yes, building community
is important. But the ins and outs of how to re
alize these goals in creative and effective ways
have vet to be elucidated by either slate.
The relationship of the ASSU to the I niver
sit\ is also kev. While an antagonistic approach
to tlie I niversity does little to further student
(auses, a stance of blind trust is not ideal it her.
II we take the I niversitv s word as gospel, we
automaticallv place student interests below
I niversitv ones — a dangerous game to plav.
Finallv, the candidates must be receptive to
the needs and concerns of the student com
munitv. Regardless of how candidates feel
about a specific issue, it is their duty as elected
leaders to make sure that student activists of
every kind are provided with as many oppor
tunities as possible to have their voices heard.
Though both slates showed potential to
achieve manv of the goals we have outlined
here, neither offered a complete enough pack
age to merit the full endorsement of The Daily's
editorial hoard. Though this mav largely have
been a result of the truncated election period
.ind the lack of ASM -sponsored means of pub
licizing and evaluating the election process, we
did not feel justified in lowering our standards
of endorsement to compensate for all that went
wrong in this year's election.

We hope that students will take the time to go
to all the slates' Web sites and think critically
about which people and what issues they want
to represent them next year. I lowever, while we
encourage students to vote according to how
their own views are addressed by the slates, we
would also like to stress the need for students to
do more than just vote.
As evidenced by past lack of activity and ac
countability within the ASSU, our votes are not
enough to make a statement. This year, i! the
ASSU has disappointed you as much as it has us,
take the time to write a letter to the Elections
Commission or executive officers, make it your
mission to appear at ASSU office hours, or bring
your own voice to the Undergraduate Senate
floor. Our elected officials are in office to serve
us, and it is high time that they lived up to that
commitment.
To ask students to invest — by virtue of their
votes — in an organization that should, but so
often does not, invest in them is to ask students
to support an empty political process. This
year, we encourage you to make your voice
heard, but we caution you to examine whether
or not the best wav to do that is bv casting a vote
in this election. Students must take ownership
of the ASSU if it is ever to be a true agent of
change. Make your decision count.

PubUthrd Since IH9I

EVERY YEAR, I UK Daily's editorial
board interviews the slates running for
ANSI president and vice president
and, based upon those interviews,
makes an endorsement on election dav. As of
Friday afternoon, this vear was not going to be
any different. W hen the board met again Sun
day, however, our stance had changed.
l lie Daily will not be endorsing anv slate for
ASM president and vice president this vear.
After a weekend of considering the problems
of this year's election and struggling to identify
striking differences between the candidates, the
editorial board members came to the conclusion
that we could not, in good faith, make any con
crete recommendation to the student bodv
about this year's slates or the election in gener
al. I he lack of anv real checks on the election —
such as. for instance, measures that would en
sure a fair election and establish some recourse
for candidates with concerns — and the com
plete absence of good publicity also added to
our skepticism.
Though, in our interviews, it emerged that the
Brewer / (lordero and Wolfe / Shankar slates
were, in fact, the strongest, both seemed to be ad
dressing largeh the same issues and had identifi
able weaknesses that concerned us.
With this in mind, we will outline the areas of

process and policv that struck us as most impor
tant, highlighting also where the two slates
stand in these realms.
Continuity and specificitv stood out to us as
the two areas most often neglected or misun
derstood in ASSU leadership. All the slates
stressed balancing the improvements in stu
dent life th.il characterized the Levin Mills ad
ministration of last year with the strides in ad
vocacy stressed In the current Newton / Yille
gas administration.
However, despite this stated goal, neither
slate demonstrated a viable plan for achieving
this balance. Though Brewer and (lordero em
phasized their commitment to continuitv and
advocacy — Brewer having been involved in
this vear's ASSL efforts in this area— their
platform lacked the specific it\ necessan to ef
fect anv real change in the short one-vcar term.
B\ contrast, Wolfe and Shankar's platform
showed a commitment to delivering results —
and had the research to support that — but
their knowledge of advocac\ issues, particular
ly those of diversity and student voice, left
much to be desired.
Beyond this fundamental difference, the two
slates used many of the same buzz words— ones
like "accountability'" and "community" — to tell
us what we already knew. Yes, the ASSI should

he more accountable. Yes, building community
is important. But the ins and outs of how to re
alize these goals in creative and effective ways
have vet to be elucidated by either slate.
The relationship of the ASSU to the I niver

to tlie I niversity does little to further student
(auses, a stance of blind trust is not ideal it her.
II we take the I niversitv s word as gospel, we
