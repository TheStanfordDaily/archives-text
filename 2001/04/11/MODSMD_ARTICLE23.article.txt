# SPECIAL-FEE ENDORSEMENTS
## 2001 ELECTIONS

IN AN KIR )RTtomake informed
special-fee endorsements, metn-
Ixts of I he Daily's editorial Ixiard
spent numerous hours during the
p.ist week reviewing budgets and
ASM I led ion Handlxxik statements sub
mitted b\ student groups requesting
ASM special lees. The meinlxTSol die ed
itorial Ixtard also met with representatives
ole.K h ol the groups to find out about the
group's goals, its acccHiiplishments during
the past vear, plans lor expansion or im
provement in the coining academic vear
.iihl how special-tee Imuls would l>e spent.
Based 011 the submitted information
.ind interview discussions, the board
readied .111 endorsement decision tor
each group based on a consensus of the
board. I he lx>ai d has tried to include as
mud) information .ihout each group as
possible 111 the explanation of its endorse
ments. I he I)ail\ encourages all students
to check the Klection Handbook online
(littp: assu.staiiford.edu/election), read
each group's statement and budget to
reat h their own conclusions.
I sing the same criteria as last year, Hie
l)ail\ has rated each student group on a 1
to 5 scale that assesses the group's effec
ti\eness and value. In evaluating the
groups, the editorial Ixiard closelv exam
ined the achievements of the tee groups
during the past year and the viability ol the
group's plans tor the upcoming year.
Student groups requesting a special fee
tor the first time were evaluated on their
expected effectiveness and value as set
forth in their proposals and presentations,
as well as the viahilit\ of their plans tor the
cc >ming year.
below is an explanation of the 1 to."> rat
ing scale that was used as a composite store
tor a group's effectiveness and value.
r> — Group successfully met .ill goals set
out during the previous year, has a
strong sense ol its constituency and an
ovcran liing vision lor the organization.
C'.roup's activities are a valuable compo
nent of student life 011 (ampus and fulfill
a need th.it would otherwise go unmet.
Group has a viable plan of activities for
the coming vear and has c lear goals for

improving 011 itself and putting its funds
to efficient and effective use.
I—Group has successfully fulfilled al
most all goals set during the previous
year and knows whom it is serving.
(Group's acti\ ities area valuable contribu
tion to the Stanford community that
would lx- missed if absent, (.roup's plan
for the u|xoniing vear is viable and in
cludes efforts to fulfill unmet goals and
use its funds effectively.
3 — (iroup has fulfilled many of its goals
and its plan fOl the upcoming vear reflects
an effort to fulfill unmet goals and achieve
improvement. Group's activities are a
value to the Stanford community.
2 — Group has met few of the previous
year's goals. Plan for the upcoming vear
does not clearh reflect effort to fulfill
unmet go.ils 01 does not seem viable.
Group's sense of its constituency is
lia/v, and its ability to effectively and ef
ficiently use funds is unclear, even
though the group's activities could be ol
value to students.
1 — (iroup has met no goals and has not
proven its value to the student p< ipulation.
(in nip's abilit\ to use funds effectively and
ctli( ienth is questionable.

ASIAN AMERICAN $29, 433

ASSOCIATION
4
AASA is an umbrella organization
that supports more than 10 Asian-
American organizations through
funding and resources. While AASA
conducts many events across cam
pus, including talent shows, fashion
shows, dances and meetings, the or
ganization should attempt to be
more proactive in educating the
community at large about Asian
American issues. Because its con
stituency is large and diverse, AASA,
as the umbrella, should work on in
ternal inclusivencss and community
building, which will only strengthen
each of the groups. AASA makes a
conscious and successful attempt to

raise funds beyond iis ASSl special
fee and manages its budget closely.
I his organization is a necessary com
ponent of campus diversity.
ASSU LEGAL $95,511
COUNSELING (B $2.29)
3
1 he ASSl Legal Counseling Office has
provided free legal advice to Stanford
students tor many years. Although the
I('.() cannot represent students in court,
their staff attorneys focus on "preventa
tive law" and will answer questions
about parking tickets, bankruptcy and
divorce, among other common issues.
The service is supported solely through
the special fee, and only a small increase
in funding is requested. This is an ex
tremely uselul and important service,
but it is important that LCO staffers
work to publicize the assistance available
to students, as many are unaware ol its
existence.
ASSU ONLINE" $16,500
COURSE GUIDE (UO $0.85)
2
Currently in its third year of existence,
the ASSL' Online Course Guide pro
vides student comments, ratings and
statistics for a variety of classes, as well as
applicable information from the Stan
ford Bulletin and the Time Schedule.
The Course Guide is billed as a one-stop
shopping tool to aid students in (boos
ing classes every quarter, and it has the
potential to be a powerful and useful
tool for students needing help picking
classes. However, the Web site currently
lacks updated information for many
classes, and usability has not improved
greatly from last year. The site would
also benefit from the addition of mes
sage boards where students can post in
formation about classes directly without

going through tlie end-of-quarter evalu
ations process. In addition, the group
relies solely on special lees for its operat
ing budget and should consider other
sources of funding. The course guide is
a relatively new resource that can help
students choose their classes and plan
their schedules, but there are still some
serious problems of usability and public
ity to work out.
ASSU SPEAKERS $125,222
BUREAU (B $3.00)
3
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a stu
dent-run organization that brings in
outside speakers to address the student
body. While it has brought in a wide va
riety of speakers, it must solicit greater
student input and work to bridge the
gap between the manv groups on cam
pus. Creativity in the selection of
speakers is an area that needs to be ad
dressed, as well as flexibility in meeting
student needs. The organization's
leadership remains solid, but greater
student involvement is central next
year.

when it is on campus, Sunday night Flicks
and (lit* distribution of a handbook for

freshmen containing the history and tradi
tions of Stanford. The group has minimal
sources of 112 unding and relies almost entire
ly on its special fee. This service is vital to
maintaining Stanford spirit, and the Axe
(onini enjoys the lull support of the Athlet
ics Department. Also notable is that mem
bership has increased dramatically over the
past several years, showing increased sup
port for the committee. With the Universi
ty's current emphasis on alumni giving, as
part ol the Campaign for Undergraduate
Kducation, Axe Conini ought to play an

nizes popular film screenings and debut

As one of many student music groups, the

fills an important niche. The orchestra not
only puts on several well-attended con
certs throughout the year, but also brings
professional jaz/ artists to campus to per
forin, discuss their trade and provide free
lessons to anyone interested. Moreover,
with high equipment costs and no funding
from the Music Department, the SJO re
lies heavily on its special fee. Although it
plays to a devoted audience and serves
anyone with an interest in playing jaz/. the
SJO could seek some alternative funding
and better publicize its concerts and ser
vices to enable more students to enjoy their

Mock I rial is a program that serves to
educate students on the American legal
system through the simulated trials and
other events held bv the American Mock
I rial Association. In addition to holding
regular meetings, the team attends one
main conference in Des Moines, lowa,
once a year. I he Mock Trial team is ask
ing fora relatively small amount of fund
ing because the team actively seeks other
forms of funding besides its special fee.
Much of the special fee, though, is bud
geted for travel expenses to help the
team fly to conferences. And, while the
group is trying to expand, tryout pro
cesses prevent Mock I rial from reaching
a significant portion of the student body.
STANFORD SOLAR $30,677
CAR PROJECT (UO $1.57)
2
Ihe Stanford Solar (.at Project is coin
prised of undergraduate and graduate
students with an interest in engineering
who design and build a solar car. which
competes in races and events throughout
the year. Most of the groups funding
comes from outside companies and the
Fngineering Department, but. given the
high cost of building a solar car, the group
should do more to attract corporate spon
sorship. I he group should also be more
proactive in recruiting female members.
Because one of the most pressing reasons
for building solar cars is to help the envi
ronment bv conserving fuel, the group
should engage in more efforts to educate
the Stanford community about the bene
fits of solar cars and other environmental
ly friendly transportation alternatives.

SKAS is an activist group that works 011
environmental justice issues. 1 his vear,
the group finished .1 suciessful campaign
to stop Stanford Hospital from dumping
medical waste in low-income neighbor
hoods in Oakland. 1 "he group involved
mam new students and still stands .is the
onl\ real voice of activism on campus.
With no coordinators and little interac
tion with the other social justice groups

on c ampus, SKAS stands to benefit from
structural changes. Many smaller groups
rely on SKAS for resources and support
for their campaigns, and SKAS has an
obligation to communicate with and as
sist the smaller groups that also make up
its constituency.

A literary and visual arts magazine,
Masque is the onh public ation tor queer

communities at Stanford, but represents
those communities to the rest ol campus

surrounding queer communities In
bringing queer artists from around the
lla\ Area to Stanford and publishing
their work. Masque has enacted several
cost-c utting measures in recent vears and
the special fee goes only toward produc
ing the magazine. Kast vear, the group
staved within budget and met its produc

As ilu' newlv created umbrella organiza
tion tor .ill martial arts groups on campus,
the Stanford Martial Arts Program pro
poses to educate the comnmnit\ about the
various martial .iris, facilitate communica
tion between the groups and ensure their
continued existence on campus, l'lie spe
cial fee will go toward the operating bud
gets ot IS dilVerent groups. In terms of
outreach and sen ice. SMAP plans to bold
dormitorv-based sell defense seminars,
put on a public martial arts demonstra
tion and develop a handbook and Web
site devoted to explaining the groups and
their particular focus. Because the De
partment of Athletics cut all funding for
martial arts at Stanford, their sun ival sig
nificantly depends on a spec ial fee. Since
tins is a new organization. SMAP has not
\e( proven lis utility to the Stanford com
munity or the effectivenss of its opera
lions. but it could potentially provide a
solid sen ice if students dec ide to enroll in
their c lasses and show interest in the mar
tial arts. Moreover, to cover such high
equipment i«»>is and a large honoraria,
the Stanford Martial Arts Program needs
to find additional sources of funding.

SIC. was created this vear bv the ASSl to

ot the new courses being ottered this quar
ter include ones on Hapa identity, emo
tional literacy and Islam in Americ a. Phis
is a novel idea, and die group is asking tor
a fairly small special fee to get the initiative
oft the ground. It will be essential to mon
itor the growth of SICover the next vear,
and SIC. officers should work to ensure
that the community is aware ot the oppor

VIENNESE BALL $10,527.75
COMMITTEE (UO $0.54)
3
l his is the first time students involved with the
Stanford Viennese Hall — a tradition since
1977 — have solicited a s[xri;d lee. I he more
than 60 members of the committee cite a need
to increase accessihilit\ to the hall as the prima
ry reason for requesting funding, as well as a
hope to hold the dance in larger venues and cut
ticket prices hv a small amount. While the ball is
certainlv an invaluable campus tradition, it
seems unfair that the entire undergraduate
communitN should have to contribute to the
ticket costs of those who attend the ball. Addi
tionally the committee suggests ticket prices
mav onK decrease b\ a nominal amount, jxt
haps $5, which is still probabh not enough to
make the ball linancialh accessible to students.
