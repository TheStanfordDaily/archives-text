the past vear, plans lor expansion or im

Based 011 the submitted information

each group based on a consensus of the
board. I he lx>ai d has tried to include as
mud) information .ihout each group as
possible 111 the explanation of its endorse
ments. I he I)ail\ encourages all students
to check the Klection Handbook online
(littp: assu.staiiford.edu/election), read
each group's statement and budget to
reat h their own conclusions.
I sing the same criteria as last year, Hie
l)ail\ has rated each student group on a 1
to 5 scale that assesses the group's effec
ti\eness and value. In evaluating the
groups, the editorial Ixiard closelv exam
ined the achievements of the tee groups
during the past year and the viability ol the
group's plans tor the upcoming year.
Student groups requesting a special fee
tor the first time were evaluated on their
expected effectiveness and value as set
forth in their proposals and presentations,
as well as the viahilit\ of their plans tor the
cc >ming year.
below is an explanation of the 1 to."> rat
ing scale that was used as a composite store
tor a group's effectiveness and value.
r> — Group successfully met .ill goals set
out during the previous year, has a
strong sense ol its constituency and an
ovcran liing vision lor the organization.
C'.roup's activities are a valuable compo
nent of student life 011 (ampus and fulfill
a need th.it would otherwise go unmet.

the coming vear and has c lear goals for

improving 011 itself and putting its funds
to efficient and effective use.
I—Group has successfully fulfilled al
most all goals set during the previous
year and knows whom it is serving.
(Group's acti\ ities area valuable contribu
tion to the Stanford community that
would lx- missed if absent, (.roup's plan
for the u|xoniing vear is viable and in
cludes efforts to fulfill unmet goals and
use its funds effectively.

and its plan fOl the upcoming vear reflects
an effort to fulfill unmet goals and achieve
improvement. Group's activities are a
value to the Stanford community.

RETURNING GROUPS

SPRING BREAK (U0$1.09)

ASB has demonstrated a marked im
provement m its organization and leader
ship ,ni(l the changes were apparent in
this \ear's trips. ASH has in< reased its pro
gramming to include post-trip wrap-tips,
community outreach to ensure pnblicit\
ol iis events and better planning. ASB is
current l\ the onlv organization on cam
pus that oilers i ommunity service oppor
tunities over spring break, which is a valu
able service lor the community. I "he
group relies heavilv on ASM special lees,
bin operates on a small budget for the
number ol trips and events it conduits
and manages these luuds verv conscious
lv and judiciouslv. I lie leadership of the
organization is very strong, ensuring at
least another year ol strong growth.
ASIAN AMERICAN $29, 433
STUDENTS (UO $1.51)
ASSOCIATION
4
AASA is an umbrella organization
that supports more than 10 Asian-
American organizations through
funding and resources. While AASA
conducts many events across cam
pus, including talent shows, fashion
shows, dances and meetings, the or
ganization should attempt to be
more proactive in educating the
community at large about Asian
American issues. Because its con
stituency is large and diverse, AASA,
as the umbrella, should work on in
ternal inclusivencss and community
building, which will only strengthen
each of the groups. AASA makes a
conscious and successful attempt to

raise funds beyond iis ASSl special
fee and manages its budget closely.
I his organization is a necessary com
ponent of campus diversity.
ASSU LEGAL $95,511
COUNSELING (B $2.29)
3
1 he ASSl Legal Counseling Office has
provided free legal advice to Stanford
students tor many years. Although the
I('.() cannot represent students in court,
their staff attorneys focus on "preventa
tive law" and will answer questions
about parking tickets, bankruptcy and
divorce, among other common issues.
The service is supported solely through
the special fee, and only a small increase
in funding is requested. This is an ex
tremely uselul and important service,
but it is important that LCO staffers
work to publicize the assistance available
to students, as many are unaware ol its
existence.
ASSU ONLINE" $16,500
COURSE GUIDE (UO $0.85)
2
Currently in its third year of existence,
the ASSL' Online Course Guide pro
vides student comments, ratings and
statistics for a variety of classes, as well as
applicable information from the Stan
ford Bulletin and the Time Schedule.
The Course Guide is billed as a one-stop
shopping tool to aid students in (boos
ing classes every quarter, and it has the
potential to be a powerful and useful
tool for students needing help picking
classes. However, the Web site currently
lacks updated information for many
classes, and usability has not improved
greatly from last year. The site would
also benefit from the addition of mes
sage boards where students can post in
formation about classes directly without

going through tlie end-of-quarter evalu
ations process. In addition, the group
relies solely on special lees for its operat
ing budget and should consider other
sources of funding. The course guide is
a relatively new resource that can help
students choose their classes and plan
their schedules, but there are still some
serious problems of usability and public
ity to work out.
ASSU SPEAKERS $125,222
BUREAU (B $3.00)
3
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a stu
dent-run organization that brings in
outside speakers to address the student
body. While it has brought in a wide va
riety of speakers, it must solicit greater
student input and work to bridge the
gap between the manv groups on cam
pus. Creativity in the selection of
speakers is an area that needs to be ad
dressed, as well as flexibility in meeting
student needs. The organization's
leadership remains solid, but greater
student involvement is central next
year.
BARRIO $22,864.6f

ble by working to form relationships be
tween Stanford students and children in
EPA. HA. b\ providing stimulating experi
ences for young children who return year
after year, is an invaluable asset to the Stan
ford community.
