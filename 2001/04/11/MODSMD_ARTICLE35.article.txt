The same is true tor .ill sports:
It's just so much nicer to pla\ at
home.
After surviving a tough road
stretch, the No. 0 Stanford men's
tennis team (10-1, 5-0 Pacific-10
Conference) returned to comfort
able Tan he Tennis Stadium, win
ning its first dual match, 5-2, of a
six-game home stretch against No.
27iii California (10-7, 2-3).
In what head coach Dick Gould
claims is "the best lie's seen" the
team plav in a lew weeks, the Car
dinal dominated the (>olden Bears
in doubles play and also per
formed well in singles.
"Although [California] missed .i
few guvs, the\ si ill have a verv good
team, so 1 am very pleased with our
\ icton(.ould said. " I his was def
initeh .i good step after the last
couple of weekends."

was out with the tin.

However, the Golden Bears'
No. 1 singles player, 28th-ranked
John Paul Fruttero, was available
to pla\ against second-ranked sc
nior Alex Kim. Kim plaved Ins
most impressive match of these a
son, pummeling FYutero with Ins
grounds! tokes, 0-3, 0-1.
Cal's Robert Kowale/vk plaved
a great match in place of Barnes at
No. 2 singles, but could not han
dle 22nd-ranked junior K.|. I lip
pensteel's rocket-like serves, as
Hippensteel also won in straight

Also struggling a little bit as ol
late. 77th-ranked sophomore
Ryan I lax iland had the other Stan
ford loss of the otlier match to Ben
Miles, 6-4, 0-4, at No. 4 singles.
Seniors Scottv Scott and All

Knn and Hippensteel answered
many doubts ot their performance
this season, seeming a convincing
8-2 victorv over Fruttero and
Kowalc/N k. As the coaches predict
ed in creating the new tandem this
season. Kim's returns and ground
strokes coupled with Mippensteel's
left-handed sene was too much to
overcome tor California's No. 1
doubles team.
At No. 2 doubles, in perhaps the
most energized match of the

now, but 1 think that, as we get
clown towards the end of the sea
son, we'll keep grinding as each
mate li goes 1 Â»\." Ansari said. "We're
not winning prettv, but we're still
winning, and that * what it will take
to win the national [title]."
"We're doing pretty well right
now,' Lipsk\ said. "They are some
guvs struggling right now, but it's a
matter ot getting in more matches,
so we'll be tine."
